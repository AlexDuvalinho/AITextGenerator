The coat was shaped\ndelicately; it outlined the wearer, and, fitting him as women's\nclothes fit women, suggested an effeminacy not an attribute of the\ntall Corliss. The effeminacy belonged all to the tailor, an artist\nplying far from Corliss Street, for the coat would have\nencountered a hundred of its fellows at Trouville or Ostende this\nvery day. Corliss Street is the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne, the\nPark Lane, the Fifth Avenue, of Capitol City, that smoky\nilluminant of our great central levels, but although it esteems\nitself an established cosmopolitan thoroughfare, it is still\nprovincial enough to be watchful; and even in its torrid languor\ntook some note of the alien garment.\n\nMr. Corliss, treading for the first time in seventeen years the\npavements of this namesake of his grandfather, mildly repaid its\ninterest in himself. The street, once the most peaceful in the\nworld, he thought, had changed. It was still long and straight,\nstill shaded by trees so noble that they were betrothed, here and\nthere, high over the wide white roadway, the shimmering tunnels\nthus contrived shot with gold and blue; but its pristine complete\nrestfulness was departed: gasoline had arrived, and a pedestrian,\neven this August day of heat, must glance two ways before\ncrossing.\n\nArchitectural transformations, as vital, staggered the returned\nnative. In his boyhood that posthumously libelled sovereign lady,\nAnne, had terribly prevailed among the dwellings on this highway;\nnow, however, there was little left of the jig-saw's hare-brained\nministrations; but the growing pains of the adolescent city had\nwrought some madness here. There had been a revolution which was a\nriot; and, plainly incited by a new outbreak of the colonies, the\nGoth, the Tudor, and the Tuscan had harried the upper reaches to a\nturmoil attaining its climax in a howl or two from the Spanish\nMoor.\n\nYet it was a pleasant street in spite of its improvements; in\nspite, too, of a long, gray smoke-plume crossing the summer sky\nand dropping an occasional atomy of coal upon Mr. Corliss's white\ncoat. The green continuous masses of tree-foliage, lawn, and\nshrubbery were splendidly asserted; there was a faint wholesome\nodour from the fine block pavement of the roadway, white, save\nwhere the snailish water-wagon laid its long strips of steaming\nbrown. Locusts, serenaders of the heat, invisible among the\nbranches, rasped their interminable cadences, competing bitterly\nwith the monotonous chattering of lawn-mowers propelled by\nglistening black men over the level swards beneath. And though\nporch and terrace were left to vacant wicker chairs and\nswinging-seats, and to flowers and plants in jars and green boxes,\nand the people sat unseen--and, it might be guessed, unclad for\nexhibition, in the dimmer recesses of their houses--nevertheless,\na summery girl under an alluring parasol now and then prettily\ntrod the sidewalks, and did not altogether suppress an ample\nconsciousness of the white pedestrian's stalwart grace; nor was\nhis quick glance too distressingly modest to be aware of these\nfaint but attractive perturbations.\n\nA few of the oldest houses remained as he remembered them, and\nthere were two or three relics of mansard and cupola days; but the\nherd of cast-iron deer that once guarded these lawns, standing\nsentinel to all true gentry: Whither were they fled? In his\nboyhood, one specimen betokened a family of position and\naffluence; two, one on each side of the front walk, spoke of a\nnoble opulence; two and a fountain were overwhelming. He wondered\nin what obscure thickets that once proud herd now grazed; and then\nhe smiled, as through a leafy opening of shrubbery he caught a\nglimpse of a last survivor, still loyally alert, the haughty head\nthrown back in everlasting challenge and one foreleg lifted,\nstanding in a vast and shadowy backyard with a clothesline\nfastened to its antlers.\n\nMr. Corliss remembered that backyard very well: it was an old\nbattlefield whereon he had conquered; and he wondered if \"the\nLindley boys\" still lived there, and if Richard Lindley would hate\nhim now as implacably as then.\n\nA hundred yards farther on, he paused before a house more familiar\nto him than any other, and gave it a moment's whimsical attention,\nwithout emotion.\n\nIt was a shabby old brick structure, and it stood among the\ngayest, the most flamboyant dwellings of all Corliss Street like a\nbewildered tramp surrounded by carnival maskers. It held place\nfull in the course of the fury for demolition and rebuilding, but\nremained unaltered--even unrepaired, one might have thought--since\nthe early seventies, when it was built. There was a sagging\ncornice, and the nauseous brown which the walls had years ago been\npainted was sooted to a repellent dinge, so cracked and peeled\nthat the haggard red bricks were exposed, like a beggar through\nthe holes in his coat. It was one of those houses which are large\nwithout being commodious; its very tall, very narrow windows, with\ntheir attenuated, rusty inside shutters, boasting to the passerby\nof high ceilings but betraying the miserly floor spaces. At each\nside of the front door was a high and cramped bay-window, one of\nthem insanely culminating in a little six-sided tower of slate,\nand both of them girdled above the basement windows by a narrow\nporch, which ran across the front of the house and gave access to\nthe shallow vestibule. However, a pleasant circumstance modified\nthe gloom of this edifice and assured it a remnant of reserve and\ndignity in its ill-considered old age: it stood back a fine\nhundred feet from the highway, and was shielded in part by a\nfriendly group of maple trees and one glorious elm, hoary, robust,\nand majestic, a veteran of the days when this was forest ground.\n\nMr. Corliss concluded his momentary pause by walking up the broken\ncement path, which was hard beset by plantain-weed and the long\ngrass of the ill-kept lawn. Ascending the steps, he was assailed\nby an odour as of vehement bananas, a diffusion from some painful\nlittle chairs standing in the long, high, dim, rather sorrowful\nhall disclosed beyond the open double doors. They were stiff\nlittle chairs of an inconsequent, mongrel pattern; armless, with\nperforated wooden seats; legs tortured by the lathe to a semblance\nof buttons strung on a rod; and they had that day received a\nstreaky coat of a gilding preparation which exhaled the olfactory\nvehemence mentioned. Their present station was temporary, their\npurpose, as obviously, to dry; and they were doing some incidental\ngilding on their own account, leaving blots and splashes and\nsporadic little round footprints on the hardwood floor.\n\nThe old-fashioned brass bell-handle upon the caller's right\ndrooped from its socket in a dead fag, but after comprehensive\nmanipulation on the part of the young man, and equal complaint\non its own, it was constrained to permit a dim tinkle remotely.\nSomewhere in the interior a woman's voice, not young, sang a\nrepeated fragment of \"Lead, Kindly Light,\" to the accompaniment\nof a flapping dust-cloth, sounds which ceased upon a second\nsuccessful encounter with the bell. Ensued a silence, probably to\nbe interpreted as a period of whispered consultation out of range;\na younger voice called softly and urgently, \"Laura!\" and a\ndark-eyed, dark-haired girl of something over twenty made her\nappearance to Mr. Corliss.\n\nAt sight of her he instantly restored a thin gold card-case to the\npocket whence he was in the act of removing it. She looked at him\nwith only grave, impersonal inquiry; no appreciative invoice of\nhim was to be detected in her quiet eyes, which may have surprised\nhim, possibly the more because he was aware there was plenty of\nappreciation in his own kindling glance. She was very white and\nblack, this lady. Tall, trim, clear, she looked cool in spite of\nthe black winter skirt she wore, an effect helped somewhat,\nperhaps, by the crisp freshness of her white waist, with its\nmasculine collar and slim black tie, and undoubtedly by the even\nand lustreless light ivory of her skin, against which the strong\nblack eyebrows and undulated black hair were lined with attractive\nprecision; but, most of all, that coolness was the emanation of\nher undisturbed and tranquil eyes. They were not phlegmatic: a\ncontinuing spark glowed far within them, not ardently, but\nsteadily and inscrutably, like the fixed stars in winter.\n\nMr. Valentine Corliss, of Paris and Naples, removed his\nwhite-ribboned straw hat and bowed as no one had ever bowed in\nthat doorway. This most vivid salutation--accomplished by adding\nsomething to a rather quick inclination of the body from the hips,\nwith the back and neck held straight expressed deference without\naffecting or inviting cordiality. It was an elaborate little\nformality of a kind fancifully called \"foreign,\" and evidently\nhabitual to the performer.\n\nIt produced no outward effect upon the recipient. Such\nself-control is unusual.\n\n\"Is Mr. Madison at home? My name is Valentine Corliss.\"\n\n\"He is at home.\" She indicated an open doorway upon her right.\n\"Will you wait in there?\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Mr. Corliss, passing within. \"I shall be----\"\nHe left the sentence unfinished, for he was already alone, and at\nliberty to reflect upon the extraordinary coolness of this cool\nyoung woman.\n\nThe room, with its closed blinds, was soothingly dark after the\nriotous sun without, a grateful obscurity which was one of two\nattractions discovered in it by Mr. Corliss while he waited. It\nwas a depressing little chamber, disproportionately high,\nuncheered by seven chairs (each of a different family, but all\nbelonging to the same knobby species, and all upholstered a\nrepellent blue), a scratched \"inlaid table,\" likewise knobby, and\na dangerous looking small sofa--turbulent furniture, warmly\nharmonious, however, in a common challenge to the visitor to take\ncomfort in any of it. A once-gilt gas chandelier hung from the\ndistant ceiling, with three globes of frosted glass, but\nundeniable evidence that five were intended; and two of the three\nhad been severely bitten. There was a hostile little coal-grate,\nmaking a mouth under a mantel of imitation black marble, behind an\nold blue-satin fire-screen upon which red cat-tails and an owl\nover a pond had been roughly embroidered in high relief, this owl\nmotive being the inspiration of innumerable other owls reflected\nin innumerable other ponds in the formerly silver moonlight with\nwhich the walls were papered. Corliss thought he remembered that\nin his boyhood, when it was known as \"the parlour\" (though he\nguessed that the Madison family called it \"the reception room,\"\nnow) this was the place where his aunt received callers who, she\njustifiably hoped, would not linger. Altogether, it struck him\nthat it might be a good test-room for an alienist: no incipient\nlunacy would remain incipient here.\n\nThere was one incongruity which surprised him--a wicker\nwaste-paper basket, so nonsensically out of place in this arid\ncell, where not the wildest hare-brain could picture any one\ncoming to read or write, that he bestowed upon it a particular,\nfrowning attention, and so discovered the second attractive\npossession of the room. A fresh and lovely pink rose, just opening\nfull from the bud, lay in the bottom of the basket.\n\nThere was a rustling somewhere in the house and a murmur, above\nwhich a boy's voice became audible in emphatic but\nundistinguishable complaint. A whispering followed, and a woman\nexclaimed protestingly, \"Cora!\" And then a startlingly pretty girl\ncame carelessly into the room through the open door.\n\nShe was humming \"Quand I' Amour Meurt\" in a gay preoccupation, and\nevidently sought something upon the table in the centre of the\nroom, for she continued her progress toward it several steps\nbefore realizing the presence of a visitor. She was a year or so\nyounger than the girl who had admitted him, fairer and obviously\nmore plastic, more expressive, more perishable, a great deal more\ninsistently feminine; though it was to be seen that they were\nsisters. This one had eyes almost as dark as the other's, but\nthese were not cool; they were sweet, unrestful, and seeking;\nbrilliant with a vivacious hunger: and not Diana but huntresses\nmore ardent have such eyes. Her hair was much lighter than her\nsister's; it was the colour of dry corn-silk in the sun; and she\nwas the shorter by a head, rounder everywhere and not so slender;\nbut no dumpling: she was exquisitely made. There was a softness\nabout her: something of velvet, nothing of mush. She diffused with\nher entrance a radiance of gayety and of gentleness; sunlight ran\nwith her. She seemed the incarnation of a caressing smile.\n\nShe was point-device. Her close, white skirt hung from a plainly\nembroidered white waist to a silken instep; and from the crown of\nher charming head to the tall heels of her graceful white suede\nslippers, heels of a sweeter curve than the waist of a violin, she\nwas as modern and lovely as this dingy old house was belated and\nhideous.\n\nMr. Valentine Corliss spared the fraction of a second for another\nglance at the rose in the waste-basket.\n\nThe girl saw him before she reached the table, gave a little gasp\nof surprise, and halted with one hand carried prettily to her\nbreast.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said impulsively; \"I _beg_ your pardon. I didn't know\nthere was---- I was looking for a book I thought I----\"\n\nShe stopped, whelmed with a breath-taking shyness, her eyes, after\none quick but condensed encounter with those of Mr. Corliss,\nfalling beneath exquisite lashes. Her voice was one to stir all\nmen: it needs not many words for a supremely beautiful\n\"speaking-voice\" to be recognized for what it is; and this girl's\nwas like herself, hauntingly lovely. The intelligent young man\nimmediately realized that no one who heard it could ever forget\nit.\n\n\"I see,\" she faltered, turning to leave the room; \"it isn't\nhere--the book.\"\n\n\"There's something else of yours here,\" said Corliss.\n\n\"Is there?\" She paused, hesitating at the door, looking at him\nover her shoulder uncertainly.\n\n\"You dropped this rose.\" He lifted the rose from the waste-basket\nand repeated the bow he had made at the front door. This time it\nwas not altogether wasted.\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes. You lost it. It belongs to you.\"\n\n\"Yes--it does. How curious!\" she said slowly. \"How curious it\nhappened to be _there_!\" She stepped to take it from him, her eyes\nupon his in charming astonishment. \"And how odd that----\" She\nstopped; then said quickly:\n\n\"How did you know it was _my_ rose?\"\n\n\"Any one would know!\"\n\nHer expression of surprise was instantaneously merged in a flash\nof honest pleasure and admiration, such as only an artist may feel\nin the presence of a little masterpiece by a fellow-craftsman.\n\nHappily, anticlimax was spared them by the arrival of the person\nfor whom the visitor had asked at the door, and the young man\nretained the rose in his hand.\n\nMr. Madison, a shapeless hillock with a large, harassed, red face,\nevidently suffered from the heat: his gray hair was rumpled back\nfrom a damp forehead; the sleeves of his black alpaca coat were\npulled up to the elbow above his uncuffed white shirtsleeves; and\nhe carried in one mottled hand the ruins of a palm-leaf fan, in\nthe other a balled wet handkerchief which released an aroma of\ncamphor upon the banana-burdened air. He bore evidences of\ninadequate adjustment after a disturbed siesta, but, exercising a\nmechanical cordiality, preceded himself into the room by a genial\nhalf-cough and a hearty, \"Well-well-well,\" as if wishing to\nindicate a spirit of polite, even excited, hospitality.\n\n\"I expected you might be turning up, after your letter,\" he said,\nshaking hands. \"Well, well, well! I remember you as a boy.\nWouldn't have known you, of course; but I expect you'll find the\ntown about as much changed as you are.\"\n\nWith a father's blindness to all that is really vital, he\nconcluded his greeting inconsequently: \"Oh, this is my little girl\nCora.\"\n\n\"Run along, little girl,\" said the fat father.\n\nHis little girl's radiant glance at the alert visitor imparted her\nthorough comprehension of all the old man's absurdities, which had\nreached their climax in her dismissal. Her parting look, falling\nfrom Corliss's face to the waste-basket at his feet, just touched\nthe rose in his hand as she passed through the door.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nCora paused in the hall at a point about twenty feet from the\ndoor, a girlish stratagem frequently of surprising advantage to\nthe practitioner; but the two men had begun to speak of the\nweather. Suffering a momentary disappointment, she went on,\nstepping silently, and passed through a door at the end of the\nhall into a large and barren looking dining-room, stiffly and\nskimpily furnished, but well-lighted, owing to the fact that one\nend of it had been transformed into a narrow \"conservatory,\" a\nglass alcove now tenanted by two dried palms and a number of\nvacant jars and earthen crocks.\n\nHere her sister sat by an open window, repairing masculine\nunderwear; and a handsome, shabby, dirty boy of about thirteen\nsprawled on the floor of the \"conservatory\" unloosing upon its\ninnocent, cracked, old black and white tiles a ghastly family of\nsnakes, owls, and visaged crescent moons, in orange, green, and\nother loathsome chalks. As Cora entered from the hall, a woman of\nfifty came in at a door opposite, and, a dust-cloth retained under\nher left arm, an unsheathed weapon ready for emergency, leaned\nsociably against the door-casing and continued to polish a\ntablespoon with a bit of powdered chamois-skin. She was tall and\nslightly bent; and, like the flat, old, silver spoon in her hand,\nseemed to have been worn thin by use; yet it was plain that the\nthree young people in the room \"got their looks\" from her. Her\neyes, if tired, were tolerant and fond; and her voice held its\nyouth and something of the music of Cora's.\n\n\"What is he like?\" She addressed the daughter by the window.\n\n\"Why don't you ask Coralie?\" suggested the sprawling artist,\nrelaxing his hideous labour. He pronounced his sister's name with\nintense bitterness. He called it \"Cora-_lee_,\" with an implication\nfar from subtle that his sister had at some time thus Gallicized\nherself, presumably for masculine favour; and he was pleased to\nreceive tribute to his satire in a flash of dislike from her\nlovely eyes.\n\n\"I ask Laura because it was Laura who went to the door,\" Mrs.\nMadison answered. \"I do not ask Cora because Cora hasn't seen him.\nDo I satisfy you, Hedrick?\"\n\n\"`Cora hasn't seen him!'\" the boy hooted mockingly. \"She hasn't?\nShe was peeking out of the library shutters when he came up the\nfront walk, and she wouldn't let me go to the door; she told Laura\nto go, but first she took the library waste-basket and laid one o'\nthem roses----\"\n\n\"_Those_ roses,\" said Cora sharply. \"He _will_ hang around the\nneighbours' stables. I think you ought to do something about it,\nmother.\"\n\n\"_Them_ roses!\" repeated Hedrick fiercely. \"One o' them roses Dick\nLindley sent her this morning. Laid it in the waste-basket and\nsneaked it into the reception room for an excuse to go galloping\nin and----\"\n\n\"`Galloping'?\" said Mrs. Madison gravely.\n\n\"It was a pretty bum excuse,\" continued the unaffected youth, \"but\nyou bet your life you'll never beat our Cora-_lee_ when there's a\nperson in pants on the premises! It's sickening.\" He rose, and\nperformed something like a toe-dance, a supposed imitation of his\nsister's mincing approach to the visitor. \"Oh, dear, I am such a\nlittle sweety! Here I am all alone just reeking with\nBrowning-and-Tennyson and thinking to myself about such lovely\nthings, and walking around looking for my nice, pretty rose. Where\ncan it be? Oh heavens, Mister, are _you_ here? Oh my, I never,\nnever thought that there was a _man_ here! How you frighten me!\nSee what a shy little thing I am? You _do see, don't_ you, old\nsweeticums? Ta, ta, here's papa. Remember me by that rose, 'cause\nit's just like me. Me and it's twins, you see, cutie-sugar!\" The\ndiabolical boy then concluded with a reversion to the severity of\nhis own manner: \"If she was _my_ daughter I'd whip her!\"\n\nHis indignation was left in the air, for the three ladies had\ninstinctively united against him, treacherously including his\nprivate feud in the sex-war of the ages: Cora jumped lightly upon\nthe table and sat whistling and polishing the nails of one hand\nupon the palm of another; Laura continued to sew without looking\nup, and Mrs. Madison, conquering a tendency to laugh, preserved a\nserene countenance and said ruminatively:\n\n\"They were all rather queer, the Corlisses.\"\n\nHedrick stared incredulously, baffled; but men must expect these\nthings, and this was no doubt a helpful item in his education.\n\n\"I wonder if he wants to sell the house,\" said Mrs. Madison.\n\n\"I wish he would. Anything that would make father get out of it!\"\nCora exclaimed. \"I hope Mr. Corliss will burn it if he doesn't\nsell it.\"\n\n\"He might want to live here himself.\"\n\n\"He!\" Cora emitted a derisive outcry.\n\nHer mother gave her a quick, odd look, in which there was a real\nalarm. \"What is he like, Cora?\"\n\n\"Awfully foreign and distinguished!\"\n\nThis brought Hedrick to confront her with a leap as of some wild\nanimal under a lash. He landed close to her; his face awful.\n\n\"Princely, I should call him,\" said Cora, her enthusiasm\nundaunted. \"Distinctly princely!\"\n\n\"Princely,\" moaned Hedrick. \"Pe-rin-sley!\"\n\n\"Hedrick!\" Mrs. Madison reproved him automatically. \"In what way\nis he `foreign,' Cora?\"\n\n\"Oh, every way.\" Cora let her glance rest dreamily upon the goaded\nboy. \"He has a splendid head set upon a magnificent torso----\"\n\n\"_Torso_!\" Hedrick whispered hoarsely.\n\n\"Tall, a glorious figure--like a young guardsman's.\" Madness was\ngathering in her brother's eyes; and observing it with quiet\npleasure, she added: \"One sees immediately he has the grand\nmanner, the bel air.\"\n\nHedrick exploded. \"`_Bel air_'!\" he screamed, and began to jump up\nand down, tossing his arms frantically, and gasping with emotion.\n\"Oh, bel air! Oh, blah! `Henry Esmond!' Been readin' `Henry\nEsmond!' Oh, you be-yoo-tiful Cora-Beatrix-a-_lee_! Magganifisent\ntorso! Gull_o_-rious figgi-your! Bel air! Oh, slush! Oh, luv-a-ly\nslush!\" He cast himself convulsively upon the floor, full length.\n\"Luv-a-ly, _luv_-a-ly slush!\"\n\n\"He is thirty, I should say,\" continued Cora, thoughtfully.\n\"Yes--about thirty. A strong, keen face, rather tanned. He's\nbetween fair and dark----\"\n\nHedrick raised himself to the attitude of the \"Dying Gaul.\" \"And\nwith `hair slightly silvered at the temples!' _Ain_'t his hair\nslightly silvered at the temples?\" he cried imploringly. \"Oh,\nsister, in pity's name let his hair be slightly silvered at the\ntemples? Only three grains of corn, your Grace; my children are\nstarving!\"\n\nHe collapsed again, laid his face upon his extended arms, and\nwrithed.\n\n\"He has rather wonderful eyes,\" said Cora. \"They seem to look\nright through you.\"\n\n\"Slush, slush, luv-a-ly slush,\" came in muffled tones from the\nfloor.\n\n\"And he wears his clothes so well--so differently! You feel at\nonce that he's not a person, but a personage.\"\n\nHedrick sat up, his eyes closed, his features contorted as with\nagony, and chanted, impromptu:\n\n    \"Slush, slush, luv-a-ly, slush!\n    Le'ss all go a-swimmin' in a dollar's worth o' mush.\n    Slush in the morning, slush at night,\n    If I don't get my slush I'm bound to get tight!\"\n\n\"Hedrick!\" said his mother.\n\n\"Altogether I should say that Mr. Valentine Corliss looks as if he\nlived up to his name,\" Cora went on tranquilly. \"Valentine Corliss\nof Corliss Street--I think I rather like the sound of that name.\"\nShe let her beautiful voice linger upon it, caressingly.\n\"Valentine Corliss.\"\n\nHedrick opened his eyes, allowed his countenance to resume its\nordinary proportions, and spoke another name slowly and with\nhoneyed thoughtfulness:\n\n\"Ray Vilas.\"\n\nThis was the shot that told. Cora sprang down from the table with\nan exclamation.\n\nHedrick, subduing elation, added gently, in a mournful whisper:\n\n\"_Poor_ old Dick Lindley!\"\n\nHis efforts to sting his sister were completely successful at\nlast: Cora was visibly agitated, and appealed hotly to her mother.\n\"Am I to bear this kind of thing all my life? Aren't you _ever_\ngoing to punish his insolence?\"\n\n\"Hedrick, Hedrick!\" said Mrs. Madison sadly.\n\nCora turned to the girl by the window with a pathetic gesture.\n\"Laura----\" she said, and hesitated.\n\nLaura Madison looked up into her sister's troubled eyes.\n\n\"I feel so morbid,\" said Cora, flushing a little and glancing\naway. \"I wish----\" She stopped.\n\nThe silent Laura set aside her work, rose and went out of the\nroom. Her cheeks, too, had reddened faintly, a circumstance\nsharply noted by the terrible boy. He sat where he was, asprawl,\npropped by his arms behind him, watching with acute concentration\nthe injured departure of Cora, following her sister. At the door,\nCora, without pausing, threw him a look over her shoulder: a\nfull-eyed shot of frankest hatred.\n\nA few moments later, magnificent chords sounded through the house.\nThe piano was old, but tuned to the middle of the note, and the\nkeys were swept by a master hand. The wires were not hammered;\nthey were touched knowingly as by the player's own fingers, and so\nthey sang--and from out among the chords there stole an errant\nmelody. This was not \"piano-playing\" and not a pianist's\ntriumphant nimbleness--it was music. Art is the language of a\nheart that knows how to speak, and a heart that knew how was\nspeaking here. What it told was something immeasurably wistful,\nsomething that might have welled up in the breast of a young girl\nstanding at twilight in an April orchard. It was the inexpressible\nmade into sound, an improvisation by a master player.\n\n\"You hear what she's up to?\" said Hedrick, turning his head at\nlast. But his mother had departed.\n\nHe again extended himself flat upon the floor, face downward, this\ntime as a necessary preliminary to rising after a manner of his\nown invention. Mysteriously he became higher in the middle, his\nbody slowly forming first a round and then a pointed arch, with\nforehead, knees, and elbows touching the floor. A brilliantly\nexecuted manoeuvre closed his Gothic period, set him upright and\nupon his feet; then, without ostentation, he proceeded to the\nkitchen, where he found his mother polishing a sugar-bowl.\n\nHe challenged her with a damnatory gesture in the direction of the\nmusic. \"You hear what Cora's up to?\"\n\nMrs. Madison's expression was disturbed; she gave her son a look\nalmost of appeal, and said, gently:\n\n\"I believe there's nothing precisely criminal in her getting Laura\nto play for her. Laura's playing always soothes her when she feels\nout of sorts--and--you weren't very considerate of her, Hedrick.\nYou upset her.\"\n\n\"Mentioning Ray Vilas, you mean?\" he demanded.\n\n\"You weren't kind.\"\n\n\"She deserves it. Look at her! _You_ know why she's got Laura at\nthe piano now.\"\n\n\"It's--it's because you worried her,\" his mother faltered\nevasively. \"Besides, it is very hot, and Cora isn't as strong as\nshe looks. She said she felt morbid and----\"\n\n\"Morbid? Blah!\" interrupted the direct boy. \"She's started after\nthis Corliss man just like she did for Vilas. If I was Dick\nLindley I wouldn't stand for Cora's----\"\n\n\"Hedrick!\" His mother checked his outburst pleadingly. \"Cora has\nso much harder time than the other girls; they're all so much\nbetter off. They seem to get everything they want, just by asking:\nnice clothes and jewellery--and automobiles. That seems to make a\ngreat difference nowadays; they all seem to have automobiles.\nWe're so dreadfully poor, and Cora has to struggle so for what\ngood times she----\"\n\n\"Her?\" the boy jibed bitterly. \"I don't see her doing any\nparticular struggling.\" He waved his hand in a wide gesture. \"She\ntakes it _all_!\"\n\n\"There, there!\" the mother said, and, as if feeling the need of\nplacating this harsh judge, continued gently: \"Cora isn't strong,\nHedrick, and she does have a hard time. Almost every one of the\nother girls in her set is at the seashore or somewhere having a\ngay summer. You don't realize, but it's mortifying to have to be\nthe only one to stay at home, with everybody knowing it's because\nyour father can't afford to send her. And this house is so\nhopeless,\" Mrs. Madison went on, extending her plea hopefully;\n\"it's impossible to make it attractive, but Cora keeps trying and\ntrying: she was all morning on her knees gilding those chairs for\nthe music-room, poor child, and----\"\n\n\"`Music-room'!\" sneered the boy. \"Gilt chairs! All show-off!\nThat's all she ever thinks about. It's all there is to Cora, just\nshow-off, so she'll get a string o' fellows chasin' after her.\nShe's started for this Corliss just exactly the way she did for\nRay Vilas!\"\n\n\"Hedrick!\"\n\n\"Just look at her!\" he cried vehemently. \"Don't you know she's\ntryin' to make this Corliss think it's _her_ playin' the piano\nright now?\"\n\n\"Oh, no----\"\n\n\"Didn't she do that with Ray Vilas?\" he demanded quickly. \"Wasn't\nthat exactly what she did the first time he ever came here--got\nLaura to play and made him think it was _her_? Didn't she?\"\n\n\"Oh--just in fun.\" Mrs. Madison's tone lacked conviction; she\nturned, a little confusedly, from the glaring boy and fumbled\namong the silver on the kitchen table. \"Besides--she told him\nafterward that it was Laura.\"\n\n\"He walked in on her one day when she was battin' away at the\npiano herself with her back to the door. Then she pretended it had\nbeen a joke, and he was so far gone by that time he didn't care.\nHe's crazy, anyway,\" added the youth, casually. \"Who is this\nCorliss?\"\n\n\"He owns this house. His family were early settlers and used to be\nvery prominent, but they're all dead except this one. His mother\nwas a widow; she went abroad to live and took him with her when he\nwas about your age, and I don't think he's ever been back since.\"\n\n\"Did he use to live in this house?\"\n\n\"No; an aunt of his did. She left it to him when she died, two\nyears ago. Your father was agent for her.\"\n\n\"You think this Corliss wants to sell it?\"\n\n\"It's been for sale all the time he's owned it. That's why we\nmoved here; it made the rent low.\"\n\n\"Is he rich?\"\n\n\"They used to have money, but maybe it's all spent. It seemed to\nme he might want to raise money on the house, because I don't see\nany other reason that could bring him back here. He's already\nmortgaged it pretty heavily, your father told me. I don't----\"\nMrs. Madison paused abruptly, her eyes widening at a dismaying\nthought. \"Oh, I do hope your father will know better than to ask\nhim to stay to dinner!\"\n\nHedrick's expression became cryptic. \"Father won't ask him,\" he\nsaid. \"But I'll bet you a thousand dollars he stays!\"\n\nThe mother followed her son's thought and did not seek to elicit\nverbal explanation of the certainty which justified so large a\nventure. \"Oh, I hope not,\" she said. \"Sarah's threatening to\nleave, anyway; and she gets so cross if there's extra cooking on\nwash-days.\"\n\n\"Well, Sarah'll have to get cross,\" said the boy grimly; \"and\n_I_'ll have to plug out and go for a quart of brick ice-cream and\ncarry it home in all this heat; and Laura and you'll have to stand\nover the stove with Sarah; and father'll have to change his shirt;\nand we'll all have to toil and moil and sweat and suffer while\nCora-lee sits out on the front porch and talks toodle-do-dums to\nher new duke. And then she'll have _you_ go out and kid him along\nwhile----\"\n\n\"_Hedrick_!\"\n\n\"Yes, you will!--while she gets herself all dressed and powdered\nup again. After that, she'll do her share of the work: she'll\nstrain her poor back carryin' Dick Lindley's flowers down the back\nstairs and stickin' 'em in a vase over a hole in the tablecloth\nthat Laura hasn't had time to sew up. You wait and see!\"\n\nThe gloomy realism of this prophecy was not without effect upon\nthe seer's mother. \"Oh, no!\" she exclaimed, protestingly. \"We\nreally can't manage it. I'm sure Cora won't want to ask him----\"\n\n\"You'll see!\"\n\n\"No; I'm sure she wouldn't think of it, but if she does I'll tell\nher we can't. We really can't, to-day.\"\n\nHer son looked pityingly upon her. \"She ought to be _my _\ndaughter,\" he said, the sinister implication all too plain;--\"just\nabout five minutes!\"\n\nWith that, he effectively closed the interview and left her.\n\nHe returned to his abandoned art labours in the \"conservatory,\"\nand meditatively perpetrated monstrosities upon the tiles for the\nnext half-hour, at the end of which he concealed his box of\nchalks, with an anxiety possibly not unwarranted, beneath the\nsideboard; and made his way toward the front door, first glancing,\nunseen, into the kitchen where his mother still pursued the\nsilver. He walked through the hall on tiptoe, taking care to step\nupon the much stained and worn strip of \"Turkish\" carpet, and not\nupon the more resonant wooden floor. The music had ceased long\nsince.\n\nThe open doorway was like a brilliantly painted picture hung upon\nthe darkness of the hall, though its human centre of interest was\nno startling bit of work, consisting of Mr. Madison pottering\naimlessly about the sun-flooded, unkempt lawn, fanning himself,\nand now and then stooping to pull up one of the thousands of\nplantain-weeds that beset the grass. With him the little spy had\nno concern; but from a part of the porch out of sight from the\nhall came Cora's exquisite voice and the light and pleasant\nbaritone of the visitor. Hedrick flattened himself in a corner\njust inside the door.\n\n\"I should break any engagement whatsoever if I had one,\" Mr.\nCorliss was saying with what the eavesdropper considered an\noffensively \"foreign\" accent and an equally unjustifiable\ngallantry; \"but of course I haven't: I am so utterly a stranger\nhere. Your mother is immensely hospitable to wish you to ask me,\nand I'll be only too glad to stay. Perhaps after dinner you'll be\nvery, very kind and play again? Of course you know how remarkable\nsuch----\"\n\n\"Oh, just improvising,\" Cora tossed off, carelessly, with a\ndeprecatory ripple of laughter. \"It's purely with the mood, you\nsee. I can't make myself do things. No; I fancy I shall not play\nagain today.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence.\n\n\"Shan't I fasten that in your buttonhole for you,\" said Cora.\n\n\"You see how patiently I've been awaiting the offer!\"\n\nThere was another little silence; and the listener was able to\nconstruct a picture (possibly in part from an active memory) of\nCora's delicate hands uplifted to the gentleman's lapel and Cora's\neyes for a moment likewise uplifted.\n\n\"Yes, one has moods,\" she said, dreamily. \"I am _all_ moods. I\nthink you are too, Mr. Corliss. You _look_ moody. Aren't you?\"\n\nA horrible grin might have been seen to disfigure the shadow in\nthe corner just within the doorway.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nIt was cooler outdoors, after dinner, in the dusk of that evening;\nnevertheless three members of the Madison family denied themselves\nthe breeze, and, as by a tacitly recognized and habitual\nhouse-rule, so disposed themselves as to afford the most agreeable\nisolation for the younger daughter and the guest, who occupied\nwicker chairs upon the porch. The mother and father sat beneath a\nhot, gas droplight in the small \"library\"; Mrs. Madison with an\nevening newspaper, her husband with \"King Solomon's Mines\"; and\nLaura, after crisply declining an urgent request from Hedrick to\nplay, had disappeared upstairs. The inimical lad alone was\ninspired for the ungrateful role of duenna.\n\nHe sat upon the topmost of the porch steps with the air of being\npermanently implanted; leaning forward, elbows on knees, cheeks on\npalms, in a treacherous affectation of profound reverie; and his\nback (all of him that was plainly visible in the hall light)\ntauntingly close to a delicate foot which would, God wot!\nwillingly have launched him into the darkness beyond. It was his\ndreadful pleasure to understand wholly the itching of that shapely\nsilk and satin foot.\n\nThe gas-light from the hall laid a broad orange path to the\nsteps--Cora and her companion sat just beyond it, his whiteness\ngray, and she a pale ethereality in the shadow. She wore an\nevening gown that revealed a vague lilac through white, and\nshimmered upon her like a vapour. She was very quiet; and there\nwas a wan sweetness about her, an exhalation of wistfulness. Cora,\nin the evening, was more like a rose than ever. She was fragrant\nin the dusk. The spell she cast was an Undine's: it was not to be\nthought so exquisite a thing as she could last. And who may know\nhow she managed to say what she did in the silence and darkness?\nFor it was said--without words, without touch, even without a\nlook--as plainly as if she had spoken or written the message: \"If\nI am a rose, I am one to be worn and borne away. Are you the man?\"\n\nWith the fall of night, the street they faced had become still,\nsave for an infrequent squawk of irritation on the part of one of\nthe passing automobiles, gadding for the most part silently, like\nfireflies. But after a time a strolling trio of negroes came\nsinging along the sidewalk.\n\n    \"In the evening, by the moonlight, you could hear\n      those banjos ringing;\n    In the evening, by the moonlight, you could hear\n      those darkies singing.\n    How the ole folks would injoy it; they would sit\n      all night an' lis-sun,\n    As we sang I-I-N the evening BY-Y-Y the moonlight.'\n\n\"Ah, _that_ takes me back!\" exclaimed Corliss. \"That's as it used\nto be. I might be a boy again.\"\n\n\"And I suppose this old house has many memories for you?\" said\nCora, softly.\n\n\"Not very many. My, old-maid aunt didn't like me overmuch, I\nbelieve; and I wasn't here often. My mother and I lived far down\nthe street. A big apartment-house stands there now, I noticed as I\nwas walking out here this afternoon--the `Verema,' it is called,\nabsurdly enough!\"\n\n\"Ray Vilas lives there,\" volunteered Hedrick, not altering his\nposition.\n\n\"Vilas?\" said the visitor politely, with a casual recollection\nthat the name had been once or twice emphasized by the youth at\ndinner. \"I don't remember Vilas among the old names here.\"\n\n\"It wasn't, I guess,\" said Hedrick. \"Ray Vilas has only been here\nabout two years. He came from Kentucky.\"\n\n\"A great friend of yours, I suppose.\"\n\n\"He ain't a boy,\" said Hedrick, and returned to silence without\nfurther explanation.\n\n\"How cool and kind the stars are to-night,\" said Cora, very\ngently.\n\nShe leaned forward from her chair, extending a white arm along the\niron railing of the porch; bending toward Corliss, and speaking\ntoward him and away from Hedrick in as low a voice as possible,\nprobably entertaining a reasonable hope of not being overheard.\n\n\"I love things that are cool and kind,\" she said. \"I love things\nthat are cool and strong. I love iron.\" She moved her arm\ncaressingly upon the railing. \"I love its cool, smooth touch. Any\nstrong life must have iron in it. I like iron in men.\"\n\nShe leaned a very little closer to him.\n\n\"Have you iron in you, Mr. Corliss?\" she asked.\n\nAt these words the frayed edge of Hedrick's broad white collar was\nlifted perceptibly from his coat, as if by a shudder passing over\nthe back and shoulders beneath.\n\n\"If I have not,\" answered Corliss in a low voice, \"I will\nhave--now!\"\n\n\"Tell me about yourself,\" she said.\n\n\"Dear lady,\" he began--and it was an effective beginning, for a\nsigh of pleasure parted her lips as he spoke--\"there is nothing\ninteresting to tell. I have spent a very commonplace life.\"\n\n\"I think not. You shouldn't call any life commonplace that has\nescaped _this_!\" The lovely voice was all the richer for the pain\nthat shook it now. \"This monotony, this unending desert of ashes,\nthis death in life!\"\n\n\"This town, you mean?\"\n\n\"This prison, I mean! Everything. Tell me what lies outside of it.\nYou can.\"\n\n\"What makes you think I can?\"\n\n\"I don't need to answer that. You understand perfectly.\"\n\nValentine Corliss drew in his breath with a sound murmurous of\ndelight, and for a time they did not speak.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, finally, \"I think I do.\"\n\n\"There are meetings in the desert,\" he went on, slowly. \"A lonely\ntraveller finds another at a spring, sometimes.\"\n\n\"And sometimes they find that they speak the same language?\"\n\nHis answer came, almost in a whisper:\n\n\"`Even as you and I.'\"\n\n\"`Even as you and I,'\" she echoed, even more faintly.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nCora breathed rapidly in the silence that followed; she had every\nappearance of a woman deeply and mysteriously stirred. Her\ncompanion watched her keenly in the dusk, and whatever the\nreciprocal symptoms of emotion he may have exhibited, they were\nfar from tumultuous, bearing more likeness to the quiet\nsatisfaction of a good card-player taking what may prove to be a\ndecisive trick.\n\nAfter a time she leaned back in her chair again, and began to fan\nherself slowly.\n\n\"You have lived in the Orient, haven't you, Mr. Corliss?\" she said\nin an ordinary tone.\n\n\"Not lived. I've been East once or twice. I spend a greater part\nof the year at Posilipo.\"\n\n\"Where is that?\"\n\n\"On the fringe of Naples.\"\n\n\"Do you live in a hotel?\"\n\n\"No.\" A slight surprise sounded in his voice. \"I have a villa\nthere.\"\n\n\"Do you know what that seems to me?\" Cora asked gravely, after a\npause; then answered herself, after another: \"Like magic. Like a\nstrange, beautiful dream.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is beautiful,\" he said.\n\n\"Then tell me: What do you do there?\"\n\n\"I spend a lot of time on the water in a boat.\"\n\n\"Sailing?\"\n\n\"On sapphires and emeralds and turquoises and rubies, melted and\nblown into waves.\"\n\n\"And you go yachting over that glory?\"\n\n\"Fishing with my crew--and loafing.\"\n\n\"But your boat is really a yacht, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Oh, it might be called anything,\" he laughed.\n\n\"And your sailors are Italian fishermen?\"\n\nHedrick slew a mosquito upon his temple, smiting himself hard.\n\"No, they're Chinese!\" he muttered hoarsely.\n\n\"They're Neapolitans,\" said Corliss.\n\n\"Do they wear red sashes and earrings?\" asked Cora.\n\n\"One of them wears earrings and a derby hat!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" she protested, turning to him again. \"You don't tell me. You\nlet me cross-question you, but you don't tell me things! Don't you\nsee? I want to know what _life_ is! I want to know of strange\nseas, of strange people, of pain and of danger, of great music, of\ncurious thoughts! What are the Neapolitan women like?\"\n\n\"They fade early.\"\n\nShe leaned closer to him. \"Before the fading have you--have you\nloved--many?\"\n\n\"All the pretty ones I ever saw,\" he answered gayly, but with\nsomething in his tone (as there was in hers) which implied that\nall the time they were really talking of things other than those\nspoken. Yet here this secret subject seemed to come near the\nsurface.\n\nShe let him hear a genuine little snap of her teeth. \"I _thought_\nyou were like that!\"\n\nHe laughed. \"Ah, but you were sure to see it!\"\n\n\"You could 'a' seen a Neapolitan woman yesterday, Cora,\" said\nHedrick, obligingly, \"if you'd looked out the front window. She\nwas working a hurdy-gurdy up and down this neighbourhood all\nafternoon.\" He turned genially to face his sister, and added: \"Ray\nVilas used to say there were lots of pretty girls in Lexington.\"\n\nCora sprang to her feet. \"You're not smoking,\" she said to Corliss\nhurriedly, as upon a sudden discovery. \"Let me get you some\nmatches.\"\n\nShe had entered the house before he could protest, and Hedrick,\nlooking down the hall, was acutely aware that she dived\ndesperately into the library. But, however tragic the cry for\njustice she uttered there, it certainly was not prolonged; and the\nalmost instantaneous quickness of her reappearance upon the porch,\nwith matches in her hand, made this one of the occasions when her\nbrother had to admit that in her own line Cora was a miracle.\n\n\"So thoughtless of me,\" she said cheerfully, resuming her seat.\nShe dropped the matches into Mr. Corliss's hand with a fleeting\ntouch of her finger-tips upon his palm. \"Of course you wanted to\nsmoke. I can't think why I didn't realize it before. I must\nhave----\"\n\nA voice called from within, commanding in no, uncertain tones.\n\n\"Hedrick! I should like to see you!\" Hedrick rose, and, looking\nneither to the right nor, to the left, went stonily into the\nhouse, and appeared before the powers.\n\n\"Call me?\" he inquired with the air of cheerful readiness to\nproceed upon any errand, no matter how difficult.\n\nMr. Madison countered diplomacy with gloom.\n\n\"I don't know what to do with you. Why can't you let your sister\nalone?\"\n\n\"Has Laura been complaining of me?\"\n\n\"Oh, Hedrick!\" said Mrs. Madison.\n\nHedrick himself felt the justice of her reproof: his reference to\nLaura was poor work, he knew. He hung his head and began to scrape\nthe carpet with the side of his shoe.\n\n\"Well, what'd Cora say I been doing to her?\"\n\n\"You know perfectly well what you've been doing,\" said Mr. Madison\nsharply.\n\n\"Nothing at all; just sitting on the steps. What'd she _say_?\"\n\nHis father evidently considered it wiser not to repeat the text of\naccusation. \"You know what you did,\" he said heavily.\n\n\"Oho!\" Hedrick's eyes became severe, and his sire's evasively\nshifted from them.\n\n\"You keep away from the porch,\" said the father, uneasily.\n\n\"You mean what I said about Ray Vilas?\" asked the boy.\n\nBoth parents looked uncomfortable, and Mr. Madison, turning a leaf\nin his book, gave a mediocre imitation of an austere person\nresuming his reading after an impertinent interruption.\n\n\"That's what you mean,\" said the boy accusingly. \"Ray Vilas!\"\n\n\"Just you keep away from that porch.\"\n\n\"Because I happened to mention Ray Vilas?\" demanded Hedrick.\n\n\"You let your sister alone.\"\n\n\"I got a right to know what she said, haven't I?\"\n\nThere was no response, which appeared to satisfy Hedrick\nperfectly. Neither parent met his glance; the mother troubled and\nthe father dogged, while the boy rejoiced sternly in some occult\ntriumph. He inflated his scant chest in pomp and hurled at the\ndefeated pair the well-known words:\n\n\"I wish she was _my_ daughter--about five minutes!\"\n\nNew sounds from without--men's voices in greeting, and a ripple of\nresponse from Cora somewhat lacking in enthusiasm--afforded Mr.\nMadison unmistakable relief, and an errand upon which to send his\ndeadly offspring.\n\nHedrick, after a reconnaissance in the hall, obeyed at leisure.\nClosing the library door nonchalantly behind him, he found himself\nat the foot of a flight of unillumined back stairs, where his\nmanner underwent a swift alteration, for here was an adventure to\nbe gone about with ceremony. \"Ventre St. Gris!\" he muttered\nhoarsely, and loosened the long rapier in the shabby sheath at his\nside. For, with the closing of the door, he had become a Huguenot\ngentleman, over forty and a little grizzled perhaps, but modest\nand unassuming; wiry, alert, lightning-quick, with a wrist of\nsteel and a heart of gold; and he was about to ascend the stairs\nof an unknown house at Blois in total darkness. He went up,\ncrouching, ready for anything, without a footfall, not even\ncausing a hideous creak; and gained the top in safety. Here he\nturned into an obscure passage, and at the end of it beheld,\nthrough an open door, a little room in which a dark-eyed lady sat\nwriting in a book by the light of an oil lamp.\n\nThe wary Huguenot remained in the shadow and observed her.\n\nLaura was writing in an old ledger she had found in the attic,\nblank and unused. She had rebound it herself in heavy gray\nleather; and fitted it with a tiny padlock and key. She wore the\nkey under her dress upon a very thin silver chain round her neck.\nUpon the first page of the book was written a date, now more than\na year past, the month was June--and beneath it:\n\n    \"Love came to me to-day.\"\n\nNothing more was written upon that page.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nLaura, at this writing, looked piquantly unfamiliar to her\nbrother: her eyes were moist and bright; her cheeks were flushed\nand as she bent low, intently close to the book, a loosened wavy\nstrand of her dark hair almost touched the page. Hedrick had never\nbefore seen her wearing an expression so \"becoming\" as the eager\nand tremulous warmth of this; though sometimes, at the piano, she\nwould play in a reverie which wrought such glamour about her that\neven a brother was obliged to consider her rather handsome. She\nlooked more than handsome now, so strangely lovely, in fact, that\nhis eyes watered painfully with the protracted struggle to read a\nlittle of the writing in her book before she discovered him.\n\nHe gave it up at last, and lounged forward blinking, with the air\nof finding it sweet to do nothing.\n\n\"Whatch' writin'?\" he asked in simple carelessness.\n\nAt the first sound of his movement she closed the book in a flash;\nthen, with a startled, protective gesture, extended her arms over\nit, covering it.\n\n\"What is it, Hedrick?\" she asked, breathlessly.\n\n\"What's the padlock for?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" she panted. \"What is it you want?\"\n\n\"You writin' poetry?\"\n\nLaura's eyes dilated; she looked dangerous.\n\n\"Oh, I don't care about your old book,\" said Hedrick, with an\namused nonchalance Talleyrand might have admired. \"There's\ncallers, and you have to come down.\"\n\n\"Who sent you?\"\n\n\"A man I've often noticed around the house,\" he replied\nblightingly. \"You may have seen him--I think his name's Madison.\nHis wife and he both sent for you.\"\n\nOne of Laura's hands instinctively began to arrange her hair, but\nthe other remained upon the book. \"Who is it calling?\"\n\n\"Richard Lindley and that Wade Trumble.\"\n\nLaura rose, standing between her brother and the table. \"Tell\nmother I will come down.\"\n\nHedrick moved a little nearer, whereupon, observing his eye, she\nput her right hand behind her upon the book. She was not deceived,\nand boys are not only superb strategic actors sometimes, but\ncalamitously quick. Appearing to be unaware of her careful\ndefence, he leaned against the wall and crossed his feet in an\noriginal and interesting manner.\n\n\"Of course _you_ understand,\" he said cosily. \"Cora wants to keep\nthis Corliss in a corner of the porch where she can coo at him; so\nyou and mother'll have to raise a ballyhoo for Dick Lindley and\nthat Wade Trumble. It'd been funny if Dick hadn't noticed anybody\nwas there and kissed her. What on earth does he want to stay\nengaged to her for, anyway?\"\n\n\"You don't know that she is engaged to Mr. Lindley, Hedrick.\"\n\n\"Get out!\" he hooted. \"What's the use talking like that to me? A\nblind mackerel could see she's let poor old Lindley think he's\nHigh Man with her these last few months; but he'll have to hit the\npike now, I reckon, 'cause this Corliss is altogether too\npe-rin-sley for Dick's class. Lee roy est mort. Vive lee roy!\"\n\n\"Hedrick, won't you please run along? I want to change my dress.\"\n\n\"What for? There was company for dinner and you didn't change\nthen.\"\n\nLaura's flushed cheeks flushed deeper, and in her confusion she\nanswered too quickly. \"I only have one evening gown. I--of course\nI can't wear it every night.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" he returned triumphantly, \"what do you want to put\nit on now for?\"\n\n\"_Please_ run along, Hedrick,\" she pleaded.\n\n\"You didn't for this Corliss,\" he persisted sharply. \"You know\nDick Lindley couldn't see anybody but Cora to save his life, and I\ndon't suppose there's a girl on earth fool enough to dress up for\nthat Wade Trum----\"\n\n\"Hedrick!\" Laura's voice rang with a warning which he remembered\nto have heard upon a few previous occasions when she had easily\nproved herself physically stronger than he. \"Go and tell mother\nI'm coming,\" she said.\n\nHe began to whistle \"Beulah Land\" as he went, but, with the swift\nclosing of the door behind him, abandoned that pathetically\noptimistic hymn prematurely, after the third bar.\n\nTwenty minutes later, when Laura came out and went downstairs, a\nfine straight figure in her black evening gown, the Sieur de\nMarsac--that hard-bitten Huguenot, whose middle-aged shabbiness\nwas but the outward and deceptive seeming of the longest head and\nthe best sword in France--emerged cautiously from the passageway\nand stood listening until her footsteps were heard descending the\nfront stairs. Nevertheless, the most painstaking search of her\nroom, a search as systematic as it was feverish, failed to reveal\nwhere she had hidden the book.\n\nHe returned wearily to the porch.\n\nA prophet has always been supposed to take some pleasure, perhaps\nmorbid, in seeing his predictions fulfilled; and it may have been\na consolation to the gloomy heart of Hedrick, sorely injured by\nLaura's offensive care of her treasure, to find the grouping upon\nthe porch as he had foretold: Cora and Mr. Corliss sitting a\nlittle aloof from the others, far enough to permit their holding\nan indistinct and murmurous conversation of their own. Their\nsequestration, even by so short a distance, gave them an\nappearance of intimacy which probably accounted for the rather\nabsent greeting bestowed by Mr. Lindley upon the son of the house,\nwho met him with some favour.\n\nThis Richard Lindley was a thin, friendly looking young man with a\npleasing, old-fashioned face which suggested that if he were\nminded to be portrayed it should be by the daguerreotype, and that\na high, black stock would have been more suitable to him than his\nbusinesslike, modern neck-gear. He had fine eyes, which seemed\nhabitually concerned with faraway things, though when he looked at\nCora they sparkled; however, it cannot be said that the sparkling\ncontinued at its brightest when his glance wandered (as it not\ninfrequently did this evening) from her lovely head to the rose in\nMr. Corliss's white coat.\n\nHedrick, resuming a position upon the top step between the two\ngroups, found the conversation of the larger annoying because it\nprevented him from hearing that of the smaller. It was carried on\nfor the greater part by his mother and Mr. Trumble; Laura sat\nsilent between these two; and Lindley's mood was obviously\ncontemplative. Mr. Wade Trumble, twenty-six, small, earnest, and\nalready beginning to lose his hair, was talkative enough.\n\nHe was one of those people who are so continuously aggressive that\nthey are negligible. \"What's the matter here? Nobody pays any\nattention to me. I'M important!\" He might have had that legend\nengraved on his card, it spoke from everything else that was his:\nface, voice, gesture--even from his clothes, for they also\nclamoured for attention without receiving it. Worn by another man,\ntheir extravagance of shape and shade might have advertised a\nself-sacrificing effort for the picturesque; but upon Mr. Trumble\nthey paradoxically confirmed an impression that he was well off\nand close. Certainly this was the impression confirmed in the mind\nof the shrewdest and most experienced observer on that veranda.\nThe accomplished Valentine Corliss was quite able to share Cora's\ndetachment satisfactorily, and be very actively aware of other\nthings at the same time. For instance: Richard Lindley's\npreoccupation had neither escaped him nor remained unconnected in\nhis mind with that gentleman's somewhat attentive notice of the\npresent position of a certain rose.\n\nMr. Trumble took up Mrs. Madison's placid weather talk as if it\nhad been a flaunting challenge; he made it a matter of conscience\nand for argument; for he was a doughty champion, it appeared, when\nnothings were in question, one of those stern men who will have\naccuracy in the banal, insisting upon portent in talk meant to be\nslid over as mere courteous sound.\n\n\"I don't know about that, now,\" he said with severe emphasis. \"I\ndon't know about that at all. I can't say I agree with you. In\nfact, I do not agree with you: it was hotter in the early part of\nJuly, year before last, than it has been at any time this summer.\nSeveral degrees hotter--several degrees.\"\n\n\"I fear I must beg to differ with you,\" he said, catching the poor\nlady again, a moment later. \"I beg to differ decidedly. Other\nplaces get a great deal more heat. Look at Egypt.\"\n\n\"Permit me to disagree,\" he interrupted her at once, when she\npathetically squirmed to another subject. \"There's more than one\nside to this matter. You are looking at this matter from a totally\nwrong angle. . . . Let me inform you that statistics. . . .\" Mrs.\nMadison's gentle voice was no more than just audible in the short\nintervals he permitted; a blind listener would have thought Mr.\nTrumble at the telephone. Hedrick was thankful when his mother\nfinally gave up altogether the display of her ignorance,\ninaccuracy, and general misinformation, and Trumble talked alone.\nThat must have been the young man's object; certainly he had\nstruggled for it; and so it must have pleased him. He talked on\nand on and on; he passed from one topic to another with no pause;\nswinging over the gaps with a \"Now you take,\" or, \"And that\nreminds me,\" filling many a vacancy with \"So-and-so and\nso-and-so,\" and other stencils, while casting about for material\nto continue. Everything was italicized, the significant and the\ntrivial, to the same monotone of emphasis. Death and shoe-laces\nwere all the same to him.\n\nAnything was all the same to him so long as he talked.\n\nHedrick's irritation was gradually dispelled; and, becoming used\nto the sound, he found it lulling; relaxed his attitude and\ndrowsed; Mr. Lindley was obviously lost in a reverie; Mrs.\nMadison, her hand shading her eyes, went over her market-list for\nthe morrow and otherwise set her house in order; Laura alone sat\nstraight in her chair; and her face was toward the vocalist, but\nas she was in deep shadow her expression could not be guessed.\nHowever, one person in that group must have listened with genuine\npleasure--else why did he talk?\n\nIt was the returned native whose departure at last rang the\ncurtain on the monologue. The end of the long sheltered seclusion\nof Cora and her companion was a whispered word. He spoke it first:\n\n\"To-morrow?\"\n\n\"To-morrow.\"\n\nCora gave a keen, quick, indrawn sigh--not of sorrow--and sank\nback in her chair, as he touched her hand in farewell and rose to\ngo. She remained where she was, motionless and silent in the dark,\nwhile he crossed to Mrs. Madison, and prefaced a leave-taking\nunusually formal for these precincts with his mannered bow. He\nshook hands with Richard Lindley, asking genially:\n\n\"Do you still live where you did--just below here?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"When I passed by there this afternoon,\" said Corliss, \"it\nrecalled a stupendous conflict we had, once upon a time; but I\ncouldn't remember the cause.\"\n\n\"I remember the cause,\" said Mr. Lindley, but, stopping rather\nshort, omitted to state it. \"At all events, it was settled.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the other quietly. \"You whipped me.\"\n\n\"Did I so?\" Corliss laughed gayly. \"We mustn't let it happen\nagain!\"\n\nMr. Trumble joined the parting guest, making simultaneous adieus\nwith unmistakable elation. Mr. Trumble's dreadful entertainment\nhad made it a happy evening for him.\n\nAs they went down the steps together, the top of his head just\nabove the level of his companion's shoulder, he lifted to Corliss\na searching gaze like an actor's hopeful scrutiny of a new\nacquaintance; and before they reached the street his bark rang\neagerly on the stilly night: \"Now _there_ is a point on which I\nbeg to differ with you. . . .\"\n\nMrs. Madison gave Lindley her hand. \"I think I'll go in.\nGood-night, Richard. Come, Hedrick!\"\n\nHedrick rose, groaning, and batted his eyes painfully as he faced\nthe hall light. \"What'd you and this Corliss fight about?\" he\nasked, sleepily.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Lindley.\n\n\"You said you remembered.\"\n\n\"Oh, I remember a lot of useless things.\"\n\n\"Well, what was it? I want to know what you fought about.\"\n\n\"Come, Hedrick,\" repeated his mother, setting a gently urgent hand\non his shoulder.\n\n\"I won't,\" said the boy impatiently, shaking her off and growing\nsuddenly very wideawake and determined. \"I won't move a step till\nhe tells me what they fought about. Not a step!\"\n\n\"Well--it was about a `show.' We were only boys, you know--younger\nthan you, perhaps.\"\n\n\"A circus?\"\n\n\"A boy-circus he and my brother got up in our yard. I wasn't in\nit.\"\n\n\"Well, what did you fight about?\"\n\n\"I thought Val Corliss wasn't quite fair to my brother. That's\nall.\"\n\n\"No, it isn't! How wasn't he fair?\"\n\n\"They sold tickets to the other boys; and I thought my brother\ndidn't get his share.\"\n\n\"This Corliss kept it all?\"\n\n\"Oh, something like that,\" said Lindley, laughing.\n\n\"Probably I was in the wrong.\"\n\n\"And he licked you?\"\n\n\"All over the place!\"\n\n\"I wish I'd seen it,\" said Hedrick, not unsympathetically, but as\na sportsman. And he consented to be led away.\n\nLaura had been standing at the top of the steps looking down the\nstreet, where Corliss and his brisk companion had emerged\nmomentarily from deep shadows under the trees into the\nillumination of a swinging arc-lamp at the corner. They\ndisappeared; and she turned, and, smiling, gave the delaying guest\nher hand in good-night.\n\nHis expression, which was somewhat troubled, changed to one of\nsurprise as her face came into the light, for it was transfigured.\nDeeply flushed, her eyes luminous, she wore that shining look\nHedrick had seen as she wrote in her secret book.\n\n\"Why, Laura!\" said Lindley, wondering.\n\nShe said good-night again, and went in slowly. As she reached the\nfoot of the stairs, she heard him moving a chair upon the porch,\nand Cora speaking sharply:\n\n\"Please don't sit close to me!\" There was a sudden shrillness in\nthe voice of honey, and the six words were run so rapidly together\nthey seemed to form but one. After a moment Cora added, with a\ndeprecatory ripple of laughter not quite free from the same\nshrillness:\n\n\"You see, Richard, it's so--it's so hot, to-night.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\nHalf an hour later, when Lindley had gone, Cora closed the front\ndoors in a manner which drew an immediate cry of agony from the\nroom where her father was trying to sleep. She stood on tiptoe to\nturn out the gas-light in the hall; but for a time the key\nresisted the insufficient pressure of her finger-tips: the little\norange flame, with its black-green crescent over the armature, so\nmaliciously like the \"eye\" of a peacock feather, limned the\nexquisite planes of the upturned face; modelled them with soft and\nregular shadows; painted a sullen loveliness. The key turned a\nlittle, but not enough; and she whispered to herself a\nmonosyllable not usually attributed to the vocabulary of a damsel\nof rank. Next moment, her expression flashed in a brilliant\nchange, like that of a pouting child suddenly remembering that\ntomorrow is Christmas. The key surrendered instantly, and she ran\ngayly up the familiar stairs in the darkness.\n\nThe transom of Laura's door shone brightly; but the knob, turning\nuselessly in Cora's hand, proved the door itself not so\nhospitable. There was a brief rustling within the room; the bolt\nsnapped, and Laura opened the door.\n\n\"Why, Laura,\" said Cora, observing her sister with transient\ncuriosity, \"you haven't undressed. What have you been doing?\nSomething's the matter with you. I know what it is,\" she added,\nlaughing, as she seated herself on the edge of the old\nblack-walnut bed. \"You're in love with Wade Trumble!\"\n\n\"He's a strong man,\" observed Laura. \"A remarkable throat.\"\n\n\"Horrible little person!\" said Cora, forgetting what she owed the\nunfortunate Mr. Trumble for the vocal wall which had so\neffectively sheltered her earlier in the evening. \"He's like one\nof those booming June-bugs, batting against the walls, falling\ninto lamp-chimneys-----\"\n\n\"He doesn't get very near the light he wants,\" said Laura.\n\n\"Me? Yes, he would like to, the rat! But he's consoled when he can\nget any one to listen to his awful chatter. He makes up to himself\namong women for the way he gets sat on at the club. But he has his\nuse: he shows off the other men so, by contrast. Oh, Laura!\" She\nlifted both hands to her cheeks, which were beautiful with a quick\nsuffusion of high colour. \"Isn't he gorgeous!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Laura gently, \"I've always thought so.\"\n\n\"Now what's the use of that?\" asked Cora peevishly, \"with _me_? I\ndidn't mean Richard Lindley. You _know_ what I mean.\"\n\n\"Yes--of course--I do,\" Laura said.\n\nCora gave her a long look in which a childlike pleading mingled\nwith a faint, strange trouble; then this glance wandered moodily\nfrom the face of her sister to her own slippers, which she\nelevated to meet her descending line of vision.\n\n\"And you know I can't help it,\" she said, shifting quickly to the\nrole of accuser. \"So what's the use of behaving like the Pest?\"\nShe let her feet drop to the floor again, and her voice trembled a\nlittle as she went on: \"Laura, you don't know what I had to endure\nfrom him to-night. I really don't think I can stand it to live in\nthe same house any longer with that frightful little devil. He's\nbeen throwing Ray Vilas's name at me until--oh, it was ghastly\nto-night! And then--then----\" Her tremulousness increased. \"I\nhaven't said anything about it all day, but I _met_ him on the\nstreet downtown, this morning----\"\n\n\"You met Vilas?\" Laura looked startled. \"Did he speak to you?\"\n\n\"`Speak to me!'\" Cora's exclamation shook with a half-laugh of\nhysteria. \"He made an awful _scene_! He came out of the Richfield\nHotel barroom on Main Street just as I was going into the\njeweller's next door, and he stopped and bowed like a monkey,\nsquare in front of me, and--and he took off his hat and set it on\nthe pavement at my feet and told me to kick it into the gutter!\nEverybody stopped and stared; and I couldn't get by him. And he\nsaid--he said I'd kicked his heart into the gutter and he didn't\nwant it to catch cold without a hat! And wouldn't I please be so\nkind as to kick----\" She choked with angry mortification. \"It was\nhorrible! People were stopping and laughing, and a rowdy began to\nmake fun of Ray, and pushed him, and they got into a scuffle, and\nI ran into the jeweller's and almost fainted.\"\n\n\"He is insane!\" said Laura, aghast.\n\n\"He's nothing of the kind; he's just a brute. He does it to make\npeople say I'm the cause of his drinking; and everybody in this\ngossipy old town _does_ say it--just because I got bored to death\nwith his everlasting do-you-love-me-to-day-as-well-as-yesterday\nstyle of torment, and couldn't help liking Richard better. Yes,\nevery old cat in town says I ruined him, and that's what he wants\nthem to say. It's so unmanly! I wish he'd die! Yes, I _do_ wish he\nwould! Why doesn't he kill himself?\"\n\n\"Ah, don't say that,\" protested Laura.\n\n\"Why not? He's threatened to enough. And I'm afraid to go out of\nthe house because I can't tell when I'll meet him or what he'll\ndo. I was almost sick in that jeweller's shop, this morning, and\nso upset I came away without getting my pendant. There's _another_\nthing I've got to go through, I suppose!\" She pounded the yielding\npillow desperately. \"Oh, oh, oh! Life isn't worth living--it seems\nto me sometimes as if everybody in the world spent his time trying\nto think up ways to make it harder for me! I couldn't have worn\nthe pendant, though, even if I'd got it,\" she went on, becoming\nthoughtful. \"It's Richard's silly old engagement ring, you know,\"\nshe explained, lightly. \"I had it made up into a pendant, and\nheaven knows how I'm going to get Richard to see it the right way.\nHe was so unreasonable tonight.\"\n\n\"Was he cross about Mr. Corliss monopolizing you?\"\n\n\"Oh, you know how he is,\" said Cora. \"He didn't speak of it\nexactly. But after you'd gone, he asked me----\" She stopped with a\nlittle gulp, an expression of keen distaste about her mouth.\n\n\"Oh, he wants me to wear my ring,\" she continued, with sudden\nrapidity: \"and how the dickens _can_ I when I can't even tell him\nit's been made into a pendant! He wants to speak to father; he\nwants to _announce_ it. He's sold out his business for what he\nthinks is a good deal of money, and he wants me to marry him next\nmonth and take some miserable little trip, I don't know where, for\na few weeks, before he invests what he's made in another business.\nOh!\" she cried. \"It's a _horrible_ thing to ask a girl to do: to\nsettle down--just housekeeping, housekeeping, housekeeping\nforever in this stupid, stupid town! It's so unfair! Men are just\npossessive; they think it's loving you to want to possess you\nthemselves. A beautiful `love'! It's so mean! Men!\" She sprang up\nand threw out both arms in a vehement gesture of revolt. \"Damn\n'em, I wish they'd let me _alone_!\"\n\nLaura's eyes had lost their quiet; they showed a glint of tears,\nand she was breathing quickly. In this crisis of emotion the two\ngirls went to each other silently; Cora turned, and Laura began to\nunfasten Cora's dress in the back.\n\n\"Poor Richard!\" said Laura presently, putting into her mouth a\ntiny pearl button which had detached itself at her touch. \"This\nwas his first evening in the overflow. No wonder he was troubled!\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Cora. \"As if you and mamma weren't good enough for\nhim to talk to! He's spoiled. He's so used to being called `the\nmost popular man in town' and knowing that every girl on Corliss\nStreet wanted to marry him----\" She broke off, and exclaimed\nsharply: \"I wish they would!\"\n\n\"Cora!\"\n\n\"Oh, I suppose you mean that's the reason _I_ went in for him?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" explained Laura hurriedly. \"I only meant, stand still.\"\n\n\"Well, it was!\" And Cora's abrupt laugh had the glad, free ring\nfancy attaches to the merry confidences of a buccaneer in trusted\ncompany.\n\nLaura knelt to continue unfastening the dress; and when it was\nfinished she extended three of the tiny buttons in her hand.\n\"They're always loose on a new dress,\" she said. \"I'll sew them\nall on tight, to-morrow.\"\n\nCora smiled lovingly. \"You good old thing,\" she said. \"You looked\npretty to-night.\"\n\n\"That's nice!\" Laura laughed, as she dropped the buttons into a\nlittle drawer of her bureau. It was an ugly, cheap, old bureau,\nits veneer loosened and peeling, the mirror small and flawed--a\npiece of furniture in keeping with the room, which was small,\nplain and hot, its only ornamental adjunct being a silver-framed\nphotograph of Mrs. Madison, with Cora, as a child of seven or\neight, upon her lap.\n\n\"You really do look ever so pretty,\" asserted Cora.\n\n\"I wonder if I look as well as I did the last time I heard I was\npretty,\" said the other. \"That was at the Assembly in March.\nComing down the stairs, I heard a man from out of town say, `That\nblack-haired Miss Madison is a pretty girl.' And some one with him\nsaid, `Yes; you'll think so until you meet her sister!'\"\n\n\"You are an old dear!\" Cora enfolded her delightedly; then,\ndrawing back, exclaimed: \"You _know_ he's gorgeous!\" And with a\nfeverish little ripple of laughter, caught her dress together in\nthe back and sped through the hall to her own room.\n\nThis was a very different affair from Laura's, much cooler and\nlarger; occupying half the width of the house; and a rather\nexpensive struggle had made it pretty and even luxurious. The\nwindow curtains and the wall-paper were fresh, and of a quiet\nblue; there was a large divan of the same colour; a light desk,\nprettily equipped, occupied a corner; and between two gilt\ngas-brackets, whose patent burners were shielded by fringed silk\nshades, stood a cheval-glass six feet high. The door of a very\nlarge clothes-pantry stood open, showing a fine company of\ndresses, suspended from forms in an orderly manner; near by, a\nrosewood cabinet exhibited a delicate collection of shoes and\nslippers upon its four shelves. A dressing-table, charmingly\nlittered with everything, took the place of a bureau; and upon it,\nin a massive silver frame, was a large photograph of Mr. Richard\nLindley. The frame was handsome, but somewhat battered: it had\nseen service. However, the photograph was quite new.\n\nThere were photographs everywhere--photographs framed and\nunframed; photographs large and photographs small, the fresh and\nthe faded; tintypes, kodaks, \"full lengths,\" \"cabinets,\"\ngroups--every kind of photograph; and among them were several of\nCora herself, one of her mother, one of Laura, and two others of\ngirls. All the rest were sterner. Two or three were seamed across\nwith cracks, hastily recalled sentences to destruction; and here\nand there remained tokens of a draughtsman's over-generous\nstruggle to confer upon some of the smooth-shaven faces additional\nmanliness in the shape of sweeping moustaches, long beards,\ngoatees, mutton-chops, and, in the case of one gentleman of a\nblond, delicate and tenor-like beauty, neck-whiskers;--decorations\nin many instances so deeply and damply pencilled that subsequent\nattempts at erasure had failed of great success. Certainly,\nHedrick had his own way of relieving dull times.\n\nCora turned up the lights at the sides of the cheval-glass, looked\nat herself earnestly, then absently, and began to loosen her hair.\nHer lifted hands hesitated; she re-arranged the slight\ndisplacement of her hair already effected; set two chairs before\nthe mirror, seated herself in one; pulled up her dress, where it\nwas slipping from her shoulder, rested an arm upon the back of the\nother chair as, earlier in the evening, she had rested it upon the\niron railing of the porch, and, leaning forward, assumed as\nexactly as possible the attitude in which she had sat so long\nbeside Valentine Corliss. She leaned very slowly closer and yet\ncloser to the mirror; a rich colour spread over her; her eyes,\ngazing into themselves, became dreamy, inexpressibly wistful,\ncloudily sweet; her breath was tumultuous. \"`Even as you and I'?\"\nshe whispered.\n\nThen, in the final moment of this after-the-fact rehearsal, as her\nface almost touched the glass, she forgot how and what she had\nlooked to Corliss; she forgot him; she forgot him utterly: she\nleaped to her feet and kissed the mirrored lips with a sort of\npassion.\n\n\"You _darling_!\" she cried. Cora's christening had been\nunimaginative, for the name means only, \"maiden.\" She should\nhave been called Narcissa.\n\nThe rhapsody was over instantly, leaving an emotional vacuum like\na silence at the dentist's. Cora yawned, and resumed the loosening\nof her hair.\n\nWhen she had put on her nightgown, she went from one window to\nanother, closing the shutters against the coming of the morning\nlight to wake her. As she reached the last window, a sudden high\nwind rushed among the trees outside; a white flare leaped at her\nface, startling her; there was a boom and rattle as of the\nbrasses, cymbals, and kettle-drums of some fatal orchestra; and\nalmost at once it began to rain.\n\nAnd with that, from the distance came a voice, singing; and at the\nfirst sound of it, though it was far away and almost\nindistinguishable, Cora started more violently than at the\nlightning; she sprang to the mirror lights, put them out; threw\nherself upon the bed, and huddled there in the darkness.\n\nThe wind passed; the heart of the storm was miles away; this was\nonly its fringe; but the rain pattered sharply upon the thick\nfoliage outside her windows; and the singing voice came slowly up\nthe street.\n\nIt was a strange voice: high-pitched and hoarse--and not quite\nhuman, so utter was the animal abandon of it.\n\n\"I love a lassie, a bonnie, bonnie lassie,\" it wailed and piped,\ncoming nearer; and the gay little air--wrought to a grotesque of\nitself by this wild, high voice in the rain--might have been a\nbanshee's love-song.\n\n    \"I love a lassie, a bonnie, bonnie lassie.\n    She's as pure as the lily in the dell----\"\n\nThe voice grew louder; came in front of the house; came into the\nyard; came and sang just under Cora's window. There it fell silent\na moment; then was lifted in a long peal of imbecile laughter, and\nsang again:\n\n    \"Then slowly, slowly rase she up\n    And slowly she came nigh him,\n    And when she drew the curtain by--\n    `Young man I think you're dyin'.'\"\n\nCora's door opened and closed softly, and Laura, barefooted, stole\nto the bed and put an arm about the shaking form of her sister.\n\n\"The drunken beast!\" sobbed Cora. \"It's to disgrace me! That's\nwhat he wants. He'd like nothing better than headlines in the\npapers: `Ray Vilas arrested at the Madison residence'!\" She choked\nwith anger and mortification. \"The neighbours----\"\n\n\"They're nearly all away,\" whispered Laura. \"You needn't fear----\"\n\n\"Hark!\"\n\nThe voice stopped singing, and began to mumble incoherently; then\nit rose again in a lamentable outcry:\n\n\"Oh, God of the fallen, be Thou merciful to me! Be Thou\nmerciful--merciful--_merciful_\" . . .\n\n\"MERCIFUL, MERCIFUL, MERCIFUL!\" it shrieked, over and over, with\nincreasing loudness, and to such nerve-racking effect that Cora,\ngasping, beat the bedclothes frantically with her hands at each\niteration.\n\nThe transom over the door became luminous; some one had lighted\nthe gas in the upper hall. Both girls jumped from the bed, ran to\nthe door, and opened it. Their mother, wearing a red wrapper, was\nstanding at the head of the stairs, which Mr. Madison, in his\nnight-shirt and slippers, was slowly and heavily descending.\n\nBefore he reached the front door, the voice outside ceased its\ndreadful plaint with the abrupt anti-climax of a phonograph\nstopped in the middle of a record. There was the sound of a\nstruggle and wrestling, a turmoil in the wet shrubberies, branches\ncracking.\n\n\"Let me go, da----\" cried the voice, drowned again at half a word,\nas by a powerful hand upon a screaming mouth.\n\nThe old man opened the front door, stepped out, closing it behind\nhim; and the three women looked at each other wanly during a\nhushed interval like that in a sleeping-car at night when the\ntrain stops. Presently he came in again, and started up the\nstairs, heavily and slowly, as he had gone down.\n\n\"Richard Lindley stopped him,\" he said, sighing with the ascent,\nand not looking up. \"He heard him as he came along the street, and\ndressed as quick as he could, and ran up and got him. Richard's\ntaken him away.\"\n\nHe went to his own room, panting, mopping his damp gray hair with\nhis fat wrist, and looking at no one.\n\nCora began to cry again. It was an hour before any of this family\nhad recovered sufficient poise to realize, with the shuddering\ngratitude of adventurers spared from the abyss, that, under\nProvidence, Hedrick had not wakened!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\nMuch light shatters much loveliness; but a pretty girl who looks\npretty outdoors on a dazzling hot summer morning is prettier then\nthan ever. Cora knew it; of course she knew it; she knew exactly\nhow she looked, as she left the concrete bridge behind her at the\nupper end of Corliss Street and turned into a shrub-bordered\nbypath of the river park. In imagination she stood at the turn of\nthe path just ahead, watching her own approach: she saw herself as\na picture--the white-domed parasol, with its cheerful pale-green\nlining, a background for her white hat, her corn-silk hair, and\nher delicately flushed face. She saw her pale, live arms through\ntheir thin sleeves, and the light grasp of her gloved fingers upon\nthe glistening stick of the parasol; she saw the long, simple\nlines of her close white dress and their graceful interchanging\nmovements with the alternate advance of her white shoes over the\nfine gravel path; she saw the dazzling splashes of sunshine\nplaying upon her through the changeful branches overhead. Cora\nnever lacked a gallery: she sat there herself.\n\nShe refreshed the eyes of a respectable burgess of sixty, a person\nso colourless that no one, after passing him, could have\nremembered anything about him except that he wore glasses and some\nsort of moustache; and to Cora's vision he was as near transparent\nas any man could be, yet she did not miss the almost imperceptible\nsigns of his approval, as they met and continued on their opposite\nways. She did not glance round, nor did he pause in his slow walk;\nneither was she clairvoyant; none the less, she knew that he\nturned his head and looked back at her.\n\nThe path led away from the drives and more public walks of the\npark, to a low hill, thoughtfully untouched by the gardener and\nleft to the shadowy thickets and good-smelling underbrush of its\nrich native woodland. And here, by a brown bench, waited a tall\ngentleman in white.\n\nThey touched hands and sat without speaking. For several moments\nthey continued the silence, then turned slowly and looked at each\nother; then looked slowly and gravely away, as if to an audience\nin front of them. They knew how to do it; but probably a critic in\nthe first row would have concluded that Cora felt it even more\nthan Valentine Corliss enjoyed it.\n\n\"I suppose this is very clandestine,\" she said, after a deep\nbreath. \"I don't think I care, though.\"\n\n\"I hope you do,\" he smiled, \"so that I could think your coming\nmeans more.\"\n\n\"Then I'll care,\" she said, and looked at him again.\n\n\"You dear!\" he exclaimed deliberately.\n\nShe bit her lip and looked down, but not before he had seen the\nquick dilation of her ardent eyes. \"I wanted to be out of doors,\"\nshe said. \"I'm afraid there's one thing of yours I don't like, Mr.\nCorliss.\"\n\n\"I'll throw it away, then. Tell me.\"\n\n\"Your house. I don't like living in it, very much. I'm sorry you\n_can't_ throw it away.\"\n\n\"I'm thinking of doing that very thing,\" he laughed. \"But I'm glad\nI found the rose in that queer old waste-basket first.\"\n\n\"Not too much like a rose, sometimes,\" she said. \"I think this\nmorning I'm a little like some of the old doors up on the third\nfloor: I feel rather unhinged, Mr. Corliss.\"\n\n\"You don't look it, Miss Madison!\"\n\n\"I didn't sleep very well.\" She bestowed upon him a glance which\ntransmuted her actual explanation into, \"I couldn't sleep for\nthinking of you.\" It was perfectly definite; but the acute\ngentleman laughed genially.\n\n\"Go on with you!\" he said.\n\nHer eyes sparkled, and she joined laughter with him. \"But it's\ntrue: you did keep me awake. Besides, I had a serenade.\"\n\n\"Serenade? I had an idea they didn't do that any more over here. I\nremember the young men going about at night with an orchestra\nsometimes when I was a boy, but I supposed----\"\n\n\"Oh, it wasn't much like that,\" she interrupted, carelessly. \"I\ndon't think that sort of thing has been done for years and years.\nIt wasn't an orchestra--just a man singing under my window.\"\n\n\"With a guitar?\"\n\n\"No.\" She laughed a little. \"Just singing.\"\n\n\"But it rained last night,\" said Corliss, puzzled.\n\n\"Oh, _he_ wouldn't mind that!\"\n\n\"How stupid of me! Of course, he wouldn't. Was it Richard\nLindley?\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"I see. Yes, that was a bad guess: I'm sure Lindley's just the\nsame steady-going, sober, plodding old horse he was as a boy. His\npicture doesn't fit a romantic frame--singing under a lady's\nwindow in a thunderstorm! Your serenader must have been very\nyoung.\"\n\n\"He is,\" said Cora. \"I suppose he's about twenty-three; just a\nboy--and a very annoying one, too!\"\n\nHer companion looked at her narrowly. \"By any chance, is he the\nperson your little brother seemed so fond of mentioning--Mr.\nVilas?\"\n\nCora gave a genuine start. \"Good heavens! What makes you think\nthat?\" she cried, but she was sufficiently disconcerted to confirm\nhis amused suspicion.\n\n\"So it was Mr. Vilas,\" he said. \"He's one of the jilted, of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"Oh, `jilted'!\" she exclaimed. \"All the wild boys that a girl\ncan't make herself like aren't `jilted,' are they?\"\n\n\"I believe I should say--yes,\" he returned. \"Yes, in this\ninstance, just about all of them.\"\n\n\"Is every woman a target for you, Mr. Corliss? I suppose you know\nthat you have a most uncomfortable way of shooting up the\nlandscape.\" She stirred uneasily, and moved away from him to the\nother end of the bench.\n\n\"I didn't miss that time,\" he laughed. \"Don't you ever miss?\"\n\nHe leaned quickly toward her and answered in a low voice: \"You can\nbe sure I'm not going to miss anything about _you_.\"\n\nIt was as if his bending near her had been to rouge her. But it\ncannot be said that she disliked his effect upon her; for the deep\nbreath she drew in audibly, through her shut teeth, was a signal\nof delight; and then followed one of those fraught silences not\nuncharacteristic of dialogues with Cora.\n\nPresently, she gracefully and uselessly smoothed her hair from the\nleft temple with the backs of her fingers, of course finishing the\ngesture prettily by tucking in a hairpin tighter above the nape of\nher neck. Then, with recovered coolness, she asked:\n\n\"Did you come all the way from Italy just to sell our old house,\nMr. Corliss?\"\n\n\"Perhaps that was part of why I came,\" he said, gayly. \"I need a\ngreat deal of money, Miss Cora Madison.\"\n\n\"For your villa and your yacht?\"\n\n\"No; I'm a magician, dear lady----\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, almost angrily. \"Of course you know it!\"\n\n\"You mock me! No; I'm going to make everybody rich who will trust\nme. I have a secret, and it's worth a mountain of gold. I've put\nall I have into it, and will put in everything else I can get for\nmyself, but it's going to take a great deal more than that. And\neverybody who goes into it will come out on Monte Cristo's\nisland.\"\n\n\"Then I'm sorry papa hasn't anything to put in,\" she said.\n\n\"But he has: his experience in business and his integrity. I want\nhim to be secretary of my company. Will you help me to get him?\"\nhe laughed.\n\n\"Do you want me to?\" she asked with a quick, serious glance\nstraight in his eyes, one which he met admirably.\n\n\"I have an extremely definite impression,\" he said lightly, \"that\nyou can make anybody you know do just what you want him to.\"\n\n\"And I have another that you have still another `extremely\ndefinite impression' that takes rank over that,\" she said, but not\nwith his lightness, for her tone was faintly rueful. \"It is that\nyou can make _me_ do just what you want me to.\"\n\nMr. Valentine Corliss threw himself back on the bench and laughed\naloud. \"What a girl!\" he cried. Then for a fraction of a second he\nset his hand over hers, an evanescent touch at which her whole\nbody started and visibly thrilled.\n\nShe lifted her gloved hand and looked at it with an odd wonder;\nher alert emotions, always too ready, flinging their banners to\nher cheeks again.\n\n\"Oh, I don't think it's soiled,\" he said, a speech which she\npunished with a look of starry contempt. For an instant she made\nhim afraid that something had gone wrong with his measuring tape;\nbut with a slow movement she set her hand softly against her hot\ncheek; and he was reassured: it was not his touching her that had\noffended her, but the allusion to it.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said, very softly.\n\nShe dropped her hand to her parasol, and began, musingly, to dig\nlittle holes in the gravel of the path. \"Richard Lindley is\nlooking for investments,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm glad to hear he's been so successful,\" returned Corliss.\n\n\"He might like a share in your gold-mine.\"\n\n\"Thank heaven it isn't literally a gold-mine,\" he exclaimed.\n\"There have been so many crooked ones exploited I don't believe\nyou could get anybody nowadays to come in on a real one. But I\nthink you'd make an excellent partner for an adventurer who had\ndiscovered hidden treasure; and I'm that particular kind of\nadventurer. I think I'll take you in.\"\n\n\"Do you?\"\n\n\"How would you like to save a man from being ruined?\"\n\n\"Ruined? You don't mean it literally?\"\n\n\"Literally!\" He laughed gayly. \"If I don't `land' this I'm gone,\nsmashed, finished--quite ended! Don't bother, I'm going to `land'\nit. And it's rather a serious compliment I'm paying you, thinking\nyou can help me. I'd like to see a woman--just once in the\nworld--who could manage a thing like this.\" He became suddenly\nvery grave. \"Good God! wouldn't I be at her feet!\"\n\nHer eyes became even more eager. \"You think I--I _might_ be a\nwoman who could?\"\n\n\"Who knows, Miss Madison? I believe----\" He stopped abruptly, then\nin a lowered, graver voice asked: \"Doesn't it somehow seem a\nlittle queer to you when we call each other, `Miss Madison' and\n`Mr. Corliss'?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered slowly; \"it does.\"\n\n\"Doesn't it seem to you,\" he went on, in the same tone, \"that we\nonly `Miss' and `Mister' each other in fun? That though you never\nsaw me until yesterday, we've gone pretty far beyond mere\nsurfaces? That we did in our talk, last night?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she repeated; \"it does.\"\n\nHe let a pause follow, and then said huskily:\n\n\"How far are we going?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" She was barely audible; but she turned\ndeliberately, and there took place an eager exchange of looks\nwhich continued a long while. At last, and without ending this\nserious encounter, she whispered:\n\n\"How far do _you_ think?\"\n\nMr. Corliss did not answer, and a peculiar phenomenon became\nvaguely evident to the girl facing him: his eyes were still fixed\nfull upon hers, but he was not actually looking at her;\nnevertheless, and with an extraordinarily acute attention, he was\nunquestionably looking at something. The direct front of pupil and\niris did not waver from her; but for the time he was not aware of\nher; had not even heard her question. Something in the outer field\nof his vision had suddenly and completely engrossed him; something\nin that nebulous and hazy background which we see, as we say, with\nthe white of the eye. Cora instinctively turned and looked behind\nher, down the path.\n\nThere was no one in sight except a little girl and the elderly\nburgess who had glanced over his shoulder at Cora as she entered\nthe park; and he was, in face, mien, and attire, so thoroughly the\nunnoticeable, average man-on-the-street that she did not even\nrecall him as the looker-round of a little while ago. He was\nstrolling benevolently, the little girl clinging to one of his\nhands, the other holding an apple; and a composite photograph of a\nthousand grandfathers might have resulted in this man's picture.\n\nAs the man and little girl came slowly up the walk toward the\ncouple on the bench there was a faint tinkle at Cora's feet: her\ncompanion's scarfpin, which had fallen from his tie. He was\nmaladroit about picking it up, trying with thumb and forefinger to\nseize the pin itself, instead of the more readily grasped design\nof small pearls at the top, so that he pushed it a little deeper\ninto the gravel; and then occurred a tiny coincidence: the elderly\nman, passing, let fall the apple from his hand, and it rolled\ntoward the pin just as Corliss managed to secure the latter. For\nan instant, though the situation was so absolutely commonplace, so\ncasual, Cora had a wandering consciousness of some mysterious\ntensity; a feeling like the premonition of a crisis very near at\nhand. This sensation was the more curious because nothing whatever\nhappened. The man got his apple, joined in the child's laughter,\nand went on.\n\n\"What was it you asked me?\" said Corliss, lifting his head again\nand restoring the pin to his tie. He gazed carelessly at the back\nof the grandsire, disappearing beyond a bush at a bend in the\npath.\n\n\"Who was that man?\" said Cora with some curiosity.\n\n\"That old fellow? I haven't an idea. You see I've been away from\nhere so many years I remember almost no one. Why?\"\n\n\"I don't know, unless it was because I had an idea you were\nthinking of him instead of me. You didn't listen to what I said.\"\n\n\"That was because I was thinking so intensely of you,\" he began\ninstantly. \"A startlingly vivid thought of you came to me just\nthen. Didn't I look like a man in a trance?\"\n\n\"What was the thought?\"\n\n\"It was a picture: I saw you standing under a great bulging sail,\nand the water flying by in moonlight; oh, a moon and a night such\nas you have never seen! and a big blue headland looming up against\nthe moon, and crowned with lemon groves and vineyards, all\nsparkling with fireflies--old watch-towers and the roofs of white\nvillas gleaming among olive orchards on the slopes--the sound of\nmandolins----\"\n\n\"Ah!\" she sighed, the elderly man, his grandchild, and his apple\nwell-forgotten.\n\n\"Do you think it was a prophecy?\" he asked.\n\n\"What do _you_ think?\" she breathed. \"That was really what I asked\nyou before.\"\n\n\"I think,\" he said slowly, \"that I'm in danger of forgetting that\nmy `hidden treasure' is the most important thing in the world.\"\n\n\"In great danger?\" The words were not vocal.\n\nHe moved close to her; their eyes met again, with increased\neagerness, and held fast; she was trembling, visibly; and her\nlips--parted with her tumultuous breathing--were not far from his.\n\n\"Isn't any man in great danger,\" he said, \"if he falls in love\nwith you?\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\nToward four o'clock that afternoon, a very thin, fair young man\nshakily heaved himself into a hammock under the trees in that\nbroad backyard wherein, as Valentine Corliss had yesterday\nnoticed, the last iron monarch of the herd, with unabated\narrogance, had entered domestic service as a clothes-prop. The\nyoung man, who was of delicate appearance and unhumanly pale,\nstretched himself at full length on his back, closed his eyes,\nmoaned feebly, cursed the heat in a stricken whisper. Then, as a\nlocust directly overhead violently shattered the silence, and\nseemed like to continue the outrage forever, the shaken lounger\nstopped his ears with his fingers and addressed the insect in old\nSaxon.\n\nA white jacketed mulatto came from the house bearing something on\na silver tray.\n\n\"Julip, Mist' Vilas?\" he said sympathetically.\n\nRay Vilas rustily manoeuvred into a sitting position; and, with\neyes still closed, made shift to accept the julep in both hands,\ndrained half of it, opened his eyes, and thanked the cup-bearer\nfeebly, in a voice and accent reminiscent of the melodious South.\n\n\"And I wonder,\" he added, \"if you can tell me----\"\n\n\"I'm Miz William Lindley's house-man, Joe Vaxdens,\" said the\nmulatto, in the tone of an indulgent nurse. \"You in Miz Lindley's\nbackyard right now, sittin' in a hammick.\"\n\n\"I seem to gather almost that much for myself,\" returned the\npatient. \"But I should like to know how I got here.\"\n\n\"Jes' come out the front door an' walk' aroun' the house an' set\ndown. Mist' Richard had to go downtown; tole me not to wake you;\nbut I heerd you splashin' in the bath an' you tole me you din'\nwant no breakfuss----\"\n\n\"Yes, Joe, I'm aware of what's occurred since I woke,\" said Vilas,\nand, throwing away the straws, finished the julep at one draught.\n\"What I want to know is how I happened to be here at Mr.\nLindley's.\"\n\n\"Mist' Richard brought you las' night, suh. I don' know where he\ngot you, but I heered a considerable thrashum aroun', up an' down\nthe house, an' so I come help him git you to bed in one vem\nspare-rooms.\" Joe chuckled ingratiatingly. \"Lord name! You\ncert'n'y wasn't askin' fer no _bed_!\"\n\nHe took the glass, and the young man reclined again in the\nhammock, a hot blush vanquishing his pallor. \"Was I--was I very\nbad, Joe?\"\n\n\"Oh, you was all _right_,\" Joe hastened to reassure him. \"You was\njes' on'y a little bit tight.\"\n\n\"Did it really seem only a little?\" the other asked hopefully.\n\n\"Yessuh,\" said Joe promptly. \"Nothin' at all. You jes' wanted to\nrare roun' little bit. Mist' Richard took gun away from you----\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Oh, I tole him you wasn' goin' use it!\" Joe laughed. \"But you so\nwile be din' know what you do. You cert'n'y was drunkes' man _I_\nsee in _long_ while,\" he said admiringly. \"You pert near had us\nbofe wore out 'fore you give up, an' Mist' Richard an' me, we\n_use'_ to han'lin' drunkum man, too--use' to have big times\nweek-in, week-out 'ith Mist' Will--at's Mist' Richard's brother,\nyou know, suh, what died o' whiskey.\" He laughed again in high\ngood-humour. \"You cert'n'y laid it all over any vem ole times we\nhad 'ith Mist' Will!\"\n\nMr. Vilas shifted his position in the hammock uneasily; Joe's\nhonest intentions to be of cheer to the sufferer were not wholly\nsuccessful.\n\n\"I tole Mist' Richard,\" the kindly servitor continued, \"it was a\nmighty good thing his ma gone up Norf endurin' the hot spell.\nSence Mist' Will die she can't hardly bear to see drunkum man\naroun' the house. Mist' Richard hardly ever tech nothin' himself\nno more. You goin' feel better, suh, out in the f'esh air,\" he\nconcluded, comfortingly as he moved away.\n\n\"Joe!\"\n\n\"Yessuh.\"\n\nMr. Vilas pulled himself upright for a moment. \"What use in the\nworld do you reckon one julep is to me?\"\n\n\"Mist' Richard say to give you one drink ef you ask' for it, suh,\"\nanswered Joe, looking troubled.\n\n\"Well, you've told me enough now about last night to make any man\nhang himself, and I'm beginning to remember enough more----\"\n\n\"Pshaw, Mist' Vilas,\" the coloured man interrupted, deprecatingly,\n\"you din' broke nothin'! You on'y had couple glass' wine too much.\nYou din' make no trouble at all; jes' went right off to bed. You\nought seen some vem ole times me an Mist' Richard use to have 'ith\nMist' Will----\"\n\n\"Joe!\"\n\n\"Yessuh.\"\n\n\"I want three more juleps and I want them right away.\"\n\nThe troubled expression upon the coloured man's face deepened.\n\"Mist' Richard say jes' one, suh,\" he said reluctantly. \"I'm\nafraid----\"\n\n\"Joe.\"\n\n\"Yessuh.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Ray Vilas slowly, \"whether or not you ever\nheard that I was born and raised in Kentucky.\"\n\n\"Yessuh,\" returned Joe humbly. \"I heerd so.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said the young man in a quiet voice, \"you go and get\nme three juleps. I'll settle it with Mr. Richard.\"\n\n\"Yessuh.\"\n\nBut it was with a fifth of these renovators that Lindley found his\nguest occupied, an hour later, while upon a small table nearby a\nsixth, untouched, awaited disposal beside an emptied coffee-cup.\nAlso, Mr. Vilas was smoking a cigarette with unshadowed pleasure;\nhis eye was bright, his expression care-free; and he was sitting\nup in the hammock, swinging cheerfully, and singing the\n\"Marseillaise.\" Richard approached through the yard, coming from\nthe street without entering the house; and anxiety was manifest in\nthe glance he threw at the green-topped glass upon the table, and\nin his greeting.\n\n\"Hail, gloom!\" returned Mr. Vilas, cordially, and, observing the\nanxious glance, he swiftly removed the untouched goblet from the\ntable to his own immediate possession. \"Two simultaneous juleps\nwill enhance the higher welfare,\" he explained airily. \"Sir, your\nMr. Varden was induced to place a somewhat larger order with us\nthan he protested to be your intention. Trusting you to exonerate\nhim from all so-and-so and that these few words, etcetera!\" He\ndepleted the elder glass of its liquor, waved it in the air,\ncried, \"Health, host!\" and set it upon the table. \"I believe I do\nnot err in assuming my cup-bearer's name to be Varden, although he\nhimself, in his simple Americo-Africanism, is pleased to pluralize\nit. Do I fret you, host?\"\n\n\"Not in the least,\" said Richard, dropping upon a rustic bench,\nand beginning to fan himself with his straw hat. \"What's the use\nof fretting about a boy who hasn't sense enough to fret about\nhimself?\"\n\n\"`Boy?'\" Mr. Vilas affected puzzlement. \"Do I hear aright? Sir, do\nyou boy me? Bethink you, I am now the shell of five mint-juleps\nplus, and am pot-valiant. And is this mere capacity itself to be\nlightly _boyed_? Again, do I not wear a man's garment, a man's\ngarnitures? Heed your answer; for this serge, these flannels, and\nthese silks are yours, and though I may not fill them to the\nutmost, I do to the longmost, precisely. I am the stature of a\nman; had it not been for your razor I should wear the beard of a\nman; therefore I'll not be boyed. What have you to say in\ndefence?\"\n\n\"Hadn't you better let me get Joe to bring you something to eat?\"\nasked Richard.\n\n\"Eat?\" Mr. Vilas disposed of the suggestion with mournful hauteur.\n\"There! For the once I forgive you. Let the subject never be\nmentioned between us again. We will tactfully turn to a topic of\ninterest. My memories of last evening, at first hazy and somewhat\ndisconcerting, now merely amuse me. Following the pleasant Spanish\ncustom, I went a-serenading, but was kidnapped from beneath the\nprecious casement by--by a zealous arrival. Host, `zealous\narrival' is not the julep in action: it is a triumph of\nparaphrase.\"\n\n\"I wish you'd let Joe take you back to bed,\" said Richard.\n\n\"Always bent on thoughts of the flesh,\" observed the other sadly.\n\"Beds are for bodies, and I am become a thing of spirit. My soul\nis grateful a little for your care of its casing. You behold, I am\ngenerous: I am able to thank my successor to Carmen!\"\n\nLindley's back stiffened. \"Vilas!\"\n\n\"Spare me your protests.\" The younger man waved his hand\nlanguidly. \"You wish not to confer upon this subject----\"\n\n\"It's a subject we'll omit,\" said Richard.\n\nHis companion stopped swinging, allowed the hammock to come to\nrest; his air of badinage fell from him; for the moment he seemed\nentirely sober; and he spoke with gentleness. \"Mr. Lindley, if you\nplease, I am still a gentleman--at times.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Richard quickly.\n\n\"No need of that!\" The speaker's former careless and boisterous\nmanner instantly resumed possession. \"You must permit me to speak\nof a wholly fictitious lady, a creature of my wanton fancy, sir,\nwhom I call Carmen. It will enable me to relieve my burdened soul\nof some remarks I have long wished to address to your excellent\nself.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right,\" muttered Richard, much annoyed.\n\n\"Let us imagine,\" continued Mr. Vilas, beginning to swing again,\n\"that I thought I had won this Carmen----\"\n\nLindley uttered an exclamation, shifted his position in his chair,\nand fixed a bored attention upon the passing vehicles in the\nglimpse of the street afforded between the house and the\nshrubberies along the side fence. The other, without appearing to\nnote his annoyance, went on, cheerfully:\n\n\"She was a precocious huntress: early in youth she passed through\nthe accumulator stage, leaving it to the crude or village belle to\nrejoice in numbers and the excitement of teasing cubs in the\nbear-pit. It is the nature of this imagined Carmen to play\nfiercely with one imitation of love after another: a man thinks he\nwins her, but it is merely that she has chosen him--for a while.\nAnd Carmen can have what she chooses; if the man exists who could\nshow her that she cannot, she would follow him through the devil's\ndance; but neither you nor I would be that man, my dear sir. We\nassume that Carmen's eyes have been mine--her heart is another\nmatter--and that she has grown weary of my somewhat Sicilian\nmanner of looking into them, and, following her nature and the law\nof periodicity which Carmens must bow to, she seeks a cooler gaze\nand calls Mr. Richard Lindley to come and take a turn at looking.\nNow, Mr. Richard Lindley is straight as a die: he will not even\nshow that he hears the call until he is sure that I have been\ndismissed: therefore, I have no quarrel with him. Also, I cannot\neven hate him, for in my clearer julep vision I see that he is but\nan interregnum. Let me not offend my friend: chagrin is to be his\nas it is mine. I was a strong draught, he but the quieting potion\nour Carmen took to settle it. We shall be brothers in woe some\nday. Nothing in the universe lasts except Hell: Life is running\nwater; Love, a looking-glass; Death, an empty theatre! That\nreminds me: as you are not listening I will sing.\"\n\nHe finished his drink and lifted his voice hilariously:\n\n    \"The heavenly stars far above her,\n      The wind of the infinite sea,\n    Who know all her perfidy, love her,\n      So why call it madness in me?\n      Ah, why call it madness----\"\n\nHe set his glass with a crash upon the table, staring over his\ncompanion's shoulder.\n\n\"_What_, if you please, is the royal exile who thus seeks refuge\nin our hermitage?\"\n\nHis host had already observed the approaching visitor with some\nsurprise, and none too graciously. It was Valentine Corliss: he\nhad turned in from the street and was crossing the lawn to join\nthe two young men. Lindley rose, and, greeting him with sufficient\ncordiality, introduced Mr. Vilas, who bestowed upon the newcomer a\nvery lively interest.\n\n\"You are as welcome, Mr. Corliss,\" said this previous guest,\nearnestly, \"as if these sylvan shades were mine. I hail you, not\nonly for your own sake, but because your presence encourages a\nhope that our host may offer refreshment to the entire company.\"\n\nCorliss smilingly declined to be a party to this diplomacy, and\nseated himself beside Richard Lindley on the bench.\n\n\"Then I relapse!\" exclaimed Mr. Vilas, throwing himself back\nfull-length in the hammock. \"I am not replete, but content. I\nshall meditate. Gentlemen, speak on!\"\n\nHe waved his hand in a gracious gesture, indicating his intention\nto remain silent, and lay quiet, his eyes fixed steadfastly upon\nCorliss.\n\n\"I was coming to call on you,\" said the latter to Lindley, \"but I\nsaw you from the street and thought you mightn't mind my being as\ninformal as I used to be, so many years ago.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Richard.\n\n\"I have a sinister purpose in coming,\" Mr. Corliss laughingly went\non. \"I want to bore you a little first, and then make your\nfortune. No doubt that's an old story to you, but I happen to be\none of the adventurers whose argosies are laden with real cargoes.\nNobody knows who has or hasn't money to invest nowadays, and of\ncourse I've no means of knowing whether _you_ have or not--you see\nwhat a direct chap I am--but if you have, or can lay hold of some,\nI can show you how to make it bring you an immense deal more.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Richard pleasantly, \"I shall be glad if you can\ndo that.\"\n\n\"Then I'll come to the point. It is exceedingly simple; that's\ncertainly one attractive thing about it.\" Corliss took some papers\nand unmounted photographs from his pocket, and began to spread\nthem open on the bench between himself and Richard. \"No doubt you\nknow Southern Italy as well as I do.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't `know' it. I've been to Naples; down to Paestum;\ndrove from Salerno to Sorrentoby Amalfi; but that was years ago.\"\n\n\"Here's a large scale map that will refresh your memory.\" He\nunfolded it and laid it across their knees; it was frayed with\nwear along the folds, and had been heavily marked and dotted with\nred and blue pencillings. \"My millions are in this large irregular\nsection,\" he continued. \"It's the anklebone and instep of Italy's\nboot; this sizable province called Basilicata, east of Salerno,\nnorth of Calabria. And I'll not hang fire on the point, Lindley.\nWhat I've got there is oil.\"\n\n\"Olives?\" asked Richard, puzzled.\n\n\"Hardly!\" Corliss laughed. \"Though of course one doesn't connect\npetroleum with the thought of Italy, and of all Italy, Southern\nItaly. But in spite of the years I've lived there, I've discovered\nmyself to be so essentially American and commercial that I want to\ndrench the surface of that antique soil with the brown,\nbad-smelling crude oil that lies so deep beneath it. Basilicata is\nthe coming great oil-field of the world--and that's my secret. I\ndare to tell it here, as I shouldn't dare in Naples.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't `dare'?\" Richard repeated, with growing interest, and\nno doubt having some vague expectation of a tale of the Camorra.\nTo him Naples had always seemed of all cities the most elusive and\nincomprehensible, a laughing, thieving, begging, mandolin-playing,\nmusic-and-murder haunted metropolis, about which anything was\nplausible; and this impression was not unique, as no\ninconsiderable proportion of Mr. Lindley's fellow-countrymen share\nit, a fact thoroughly comprehended by the returned native.\n\n\"It isn't a case of not daring on account of any bodily danger,\"\nexplained Corliss.\n\n\"No,\" Richard smiled reminiscently. \"I don't believe that would\nhave much weight with you if it were. You certainly showed no\nsymptoms of that sort in your extreme youth. I remember you had\nthe name of being about the most daring and foolhardy boy in\ntown.\"\n\n\"I grew up to be cautious enough in business, though,\" said the\nother, shaking his head gravely. \"I haven't been able to afford\nnot being careful.\" He adjusted the map--a prefatory gesture.\n\"Now, I'll make this whole affair perfectly clear to you. It's a\nsimple matter, as are most big things. I'll begin by telling you\nof Moliterno--he's been my most intimate friend in that part of\nthe continent for a great many years; since I went there as a boy,\nin fact.\"\n\nHe sketched a portrait of his friend, Prince Moliterno, bachelor\nchief of a historic house, the soul of honour, \"land-poor\"; owning\nleagues and leagues of land, hills and mountains, broken towers\nand ruins, in central Basilicata, a province described as wild\ncountry and rough, off the rails and not easy to reach. Moliterno\nand the narrator had gone there to shoot; Corliss had seen\n\"surface oil\" upon the streams and pools; he recalled the\ndiscovery of oil near his own boyhood home in America; had talked\nof it to Moliterno, and both men had become more and more\ninterested, then excited. They decided to sink a well.\n\nCorliss described picturesquely the difficulties of this\nenterprise, the hardships and disappointments; how they dragged\nthe big tools over the mountains by mule power; how they had kept\nit all secret; how he and Moliterno had done everything with the\nhelp of peasant labourers and one experienced man, who had \"seen\nservice in the Persian oil-fields.\"\n\nHe gave the business reality, colouring it with details relevant\nand irrelevant, anecdotes and wayside incidents: he was fluent,\nelaborate, explicit throughout. They sank five wells, he said, \"at\nthe angles of this irregular pentagon you see here on the map,\noutlined in blue. These red circles are the wells.\" Four of the\nwells \"came in tremendous,\" but they had managed to get them\nsealed after wasting--he was \"sorry to think how many thousand\nbarrels of oil.\" The fifth well was so enormous that they had not\nbeen able to seal it at the time of the speaker's departure for\nAmerica.\n\n\"But I had a cablegram this morning,\" he added, \"letting me know\nthey've managed to do it at last. Here is, the cablegram.\" He\nhanded Richard a form signed \"Antonio Moliterno.\"\n\n\"Now, to go back to what I said about not `daring' to speak of\nthis in Naples,\" he continued, smiling. \"The fear is financial,\nnot physical.\"\n\nThe knowledge of the lucky strike, he explained, must be kept from\nthe \"Neapolitan money-sharks.\" A third of the land so rich in oil\nalready belonged to the Moliterno estates, but it was necessary to\nobtain possession of the other two thirds \"before the secret leaks\ninto Naples.\" So far, it was safe, the peasants of Basilicata\nbeing \"as medieval a lot as one could wish.\" He related that these\npeasants thought that the devils hiding inside the mountains had\nbeen stabbed by the drills, and that the oil was devils' blood.\n\n\"You can see some of the country people hanging about, staring at\na well, in this kodak, though it's not a very good one.\" He put\ninto Richard's hand a small, blurred photograph showing a spouting\nwell with an indistinct crowd standing in an irregular semicircle\nbefore it.\n\n\"Is this the Basilicatan peasant costume?\" asked Richard,\nindicating a figure in the foreground, the only one revealed at\nall definitely. \"It looks more oriental. Isn't the man wearing a\nfez?\"\n\n\"Let me see,\" responded Mr. Corliss very quickly. \"Perhaps I gave\nyou the wrong picture. Oh, no,\" he laughed easily, holding the\nkodak closer to his eyes; \"that's all right: it is a fez. That's\nold Salviati, our engineer, the man I spoke of who'd worked in\nPersia, you know; he's always worn a fez since then. Got in the\nhabit of it out there and says he'll never give it up. Moliterno's\nalways chaffing him about it. He's a faithful old chap, Salviati.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Lindley looked thoughtfully at the picture, which the\nother carelessly returned to his hand. \"There seems to be a lot of\noil there.\"\n\n\"It's one of the smaller wells at that. And you can see from the\nkodak that it's just `blowing'--not an eruption from being `shot,'\nor the people wouldn't stand so near. Yes; there's an ocean of oil\nunder that whole province; but we want a lot of money to get at\nit. It's mountain country; our wells will all have to go over\nfifteen-hundred feet, and that's expensive. We want to pipe the\noil to Salerno, where the Standard's ships will take it from us,\nand it will need a great deal for that. But most of all we want\nmoney to get hold of the land; we must control the whole field,\nand it's big!\"\n\n\"How did you happen to come here to finance it?\"\n\n\"I was getting to that. Moliterno himself is as honourable a man\nas breathes God's air. But my experience has been that Neapolitan\ncapitalists are about the cleverest and slipperiest financiers in\nthe world. We could have financed it twenty times over in Naples\nin a day, but neither Moliterno nor I was willing to trust them.\nThe thing is enormous, you see--a really colossal fortune--and\nItalian law is full of ins and outs, and the first man we talked\nto confidentially would have given us his word to play straight,\nand, the instant we left him, would have flown post-haste for\nBasilicata and grabbed for himself the two thirds of the field not\nyet in our hands. Moliterno and I talked it over many, many times;\nwe thought of going to Rome for the money, to Paris, to London, to\nNew York; but I happened to remember the old house here that my\naunt had left me--I wanted to sell it, to add whatever it brought\nto the money I've already put in--and then it struck me I might\nraise the rest here as well as anywhere else.\"\n\nThe other nodded. \"I understand.\"\n\n\"I suppose you'll think me rather sentimental,\" Corliss went on,\nwith a laugh which unexpectedly betrayed a little shyness. \"I've\nnever forgotten that I was born here--was a boy here. In all my\nwanderings I've always really thought of this as home.\"\n\nHis voice trembled slightly and his face flushed; he smiled\ndeprecatingly as though in apology for these symptoms of emotion;\nand at that both listeners felt (perhaps with surprise) the man's\nstrong attraction. There was something very engaging about him: in\nthe frankness of his look and in the slight tremor in his voice;\nthere was something appealing and yet manly in the confession, by\nthis thoroughgoing cosmopolite, of his real feeling for the\nhome-town.\n\n\"Of course I know how very few people, even among the `old\ncitizens,' would have any recollection whatever of me,\" he went\non; \"but that doesn't make any difference in my sentiment for the\nplace and its people. That street out yonder was named for my\ngrandfather: there's a statue of my great uncle in the State House\nyard; all my own blood: belonged here, and though I have been a\nwanderer and may not be remembered--naturally am _not_\nremembered--yet the name is honoured here, and I--I----\" He\nfaltered again, then concluded with quiet earnestness: \"I thought\nthat if my good luck was destined to bring fortunes to others, it\nmight as well be to my own kind--that at least I'd offer them the\nchance before I offered it to any one else.\" He turned and looked\nRichard in the face. \"That's why I'm here, Mr. Lindley.\"\n\nThe other impulsively put out his hand. \"I understand,\" he said\nheartily.\n\n\"Thank you.\" Corliss changed his tone for one less serious.\n\"You've listened very patiently and I hope you'll be rewarded for\nit. Certainly you will if you decide to come in with us. May I\nleave the maps and descriptions with you?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed. I'll look them over carefully and have another talk\nwith you about it.\"\n\n\"Thank heaven, _that's_ over!\" exclaimed the lounger in the\nhammock, who had not once removed his fascinated stare from the\nexpressive face of Valentine Corliss. \"If you have now concluded\nwith dull care, allow me to put a vital question: Mr. Corliss, do\nyou sing?\"\n\nThe gentleman addressed favoured him with a quizzical glance from\nbetween half-closed lids, and probably checking an impulse to\nremark that he happened to know that his questioner sometimes\nsang, replied merely, \"No.\"\n\n\"It is a pity.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" returned the other, inconsequently. \"It just struck me\nthat you ought to sing the Toreador song.\"\n\nRichard Lindley, placing the notes and maps in his pocket, dropped\nthem, and, stooping, began to gather the scattered papers with a\nvery red face. Corliss, however, laughed good-naturedly.\n\n\"That's most flattering,\" he said; \"though there are other things\nin `Carmen' I prefer--probably because one doesn't hear them so\neternally.\"\n\nVilas pulled himself up to a sitting position and began to swing\nagain. \"Observe our host, Mr. Corliss,\" he commanded gayly. \"He is\na kind old Dobbin, much beloved, but cares damn little to hear you\nor me speak of music. He'd even rather discuss your oil business\nthan listen to us talk of women, whereas nothing except women ever\nreally interests _you_, my dear sir. He's not our kind of man,\" he\nconcluded, mournfully; \"not at all our kind of man!\"\n\n\"I hope,\" Corliss suggested, \"he's going to be my kind of man in\nthe development of these oil-fields.\"\n\n\"How ridic\"--Mr. Vilas triumphed over the word after a slight\nstruggle--\"ulous! I shall review that: ridiculous of you to\npretend to be interested in oil-fields. You are not that sort of\nperson whatever. Nothing could be clearer than that you would\nnever waste the time demanded by fields of oil. Groundlings call\nthis `the mechanical age'--a vulgar error. My dear sir, you and I\nknow that it is the age of Woman! Even poets have begun to see\nthat she is alive. Formerly we did not speak of her at all, but of\nlate years she has become such a scandal that she is getting\ntalked about. Even our dramas, which used to be all blood, have\nbecome all flesh. I wish I were dead--but will continue my\nharangue because the thought is pellucid. Women selecting men to\nmate with are of only two kinds, just as there are but two kinds\nof children in a toy-shop. One child sets its fancy on one\npartic\"--the orator paused, then continued--\"on one certain toy\nand will make a distressing scene if she doesn't get it: she will\nhave that one; she will go straight to it, clasp it and keep it;\nshe won't have any other. The other kind of woman is to be\nunderstood if you will make the experiment of taking the other\nkind of child to a toy-shop and telling her you will buy her any\ntoy in the place, but that you will buy her only one. If you do\nthis in the morning, she will still be in the shop when it is\nclosing for the night, because, though she runs to each toy in\nturn with excitement and delight, she sees another over her\nshoulder, and the one she has not touched is always her\nchoice--until she has touched it! Some get broken in the handling.\nFor my part, my wires are working rather rustily, but I must obey\nthe Stage-Manager. For my requiem I wish somebody would ask them\nto play Gounod's masterpiece.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Corliss, amused.\n\n\"`The Funeral March of a Marionette!'\"\n\n\"I suppose you mean that for a cheerful way of announcing that you\nare a fatalist.\"\n\n\"Fatalism? That is only a word,\" declared Mr. Vilas gravely. \"If I\nam not a puppet then I am a god. Somehow, I do not seem to be a\ngod. If a god is a god, one thinks he would know it himself. I now\nyield the floor. Thanking you cordially, I believe there is a lady\nwalking yonder who commands salutation.\"\n\nHe rose to his feet, bowing profoundly. Cora Madison was passing,\nstrolling rather briskly down the street, not in the direction of\nher home. She waved her parasol with careless gayety to the trio\nunder the trees, and, going on, was lost to their sight.\n\n\"Hello!\" exclaimed Corliss, looking at his watch with a start of\nsurprise. \"I have two letters to write for the evening mail. I\nmust be off.\"\n\nAt this, Ray Vilas's eyes--still fixed upon him, as they had been\nthroughout the visit--opened to their fullest capacity, in a gaze\nof only partially alcoholic wildness.\n\nEntirely aware of this singular glare, but not in the least\ndisconcerted by it, the recipient proffered his easy farewells. \"I\nhad no idea it was so late. Good afternoon. Mr. Vilas, I have been\ndelighted with your diagnosis. Lindley, I'm at your disposal when\nyou've looked over my data. My very warm thanks for your patience,\nand--addio!\"\n\nLindley looked after him as he strode quickly away across the\ngreen lawn, turning, at the street, in the direction Cora had\ntaken; and the troubled Richard felt his heart sink with vague but\nmiserable apprehension. There was a gasp of desperation beside\nhim, and the sound of Ray Vilas's lips parting and closing with\nlittle noises of pain.\n\n\"So he knows her,\" said the boy, his thin body shaking. \"Look at\nhim, damn him! See his deep chest, that conqueror's walk, the\neasy, confident, male pride of him: a true-born, natural rake--the\nToreador all over!\"\n\nHis agitation passed suddenly; he broke into a loud laugh, and\nflung a reckless hand to his companion's shoulder.\n\n\"You good old fool,\" he cried. \"_You'll_ never play Don Jose!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n\nHedrick Madison, like too many other people, had never thought\nseriously about the moon; nor ever had he encouraged it to become\nhis familiar; and he underwent his first experience of its\nincomparable betrayals one brilliant night during the last week of\nthat hot month. The preface to this romantic evening was\nsubstantial and prosaic: four times during dinner was he copiously\nreplenished with hash, which occasioned so rich a surfeit within\nhim that, upon the conclusion of the meal, he found himself in no\ncondition to retort appropriately to a solicitous warning from\nCora to keep away from the cat. Indeed, it was half an hour later,\nand he was sitting--to his own consciousness too heavily--upon the\nback fence, when belated inspiration arrived. But there is no\nsound where there is no ear to hear, and no repartee, alas! when\nthe wretch who said the first part has gone, so that Cora remained\nunscathed as from his alley solitude Hedrick hurled in the teeth\nof the rising moon these bitter words:\n\n\"Oh, no; _our_ cat only eats _soft_ meat!\"\n\nHe renewed a morbid silence, and the moon, with its customary\ndeliberation, swung clear of a sweeping branch of the big elm in\nthe front yard and shone full upon him. Nothing warned the fated\nyouth not to sit there; no shadow of imminent catastrophe tinted\nthat brightness: no angel whisper came to him, bidding him\nbegone--and to go in a hurry and as far as possible. No; he sat\nupon the fence an inoffensive lad, and--except for still feeling\nhis hash somewhat, and a gradually dispersing rancour concerning\nthe cat--at peace. It is for such lulled mortals that the\never-lurking Furies save their most hideous surprises.\n\nChin on palms, he looked idly at the moon, and the moon\ninscrutably returned his stare. Plausible, bright, bland, it gave\nno sign that it was at its awful work. For the bride of night is\nlike a card-dealer whose fingers move so swiftly through the pack\nthe trickery goes unseen.\n\nThis moon upon which he was placidly gazing, because he had\nnothing else to do, betokened nought to Hedrick: to him it was the\nmoon of any other night, the old moon; certainly no moon of his\ndelight. Withal, it may never be gazed upon so fixedly and so\nprotractedly--no matter how languidly--with entire impunity. That\nlight breeds a bug in the brain. Who can deny how the moon wrought\nthis thing under the hair of unconscious Hedrick, or doubt its\nresponsibility for the thing that happened?\n\n\"_Little boy_!\"\n\nIt was a very soft, small voice, silky and queer; and at first\nHedrick had little suspicion that it could be addressing him: the\nmost rigid self-analysis could have revealed to him no possibility\nof his fitting so ignominious a description.\n\n\"Oh, little boy!\"\n\nHe looked over his shoulder and saw, standing in the alley behind\nhim, a girl of about his own age. She was daintily dressed and had\nbeautiful hair which was all shining in pale gold.\n\n\"Little boy!\"\n\nShe was smiling up at him, and once more she used that wantonly\ninaccurate vocative:\n\n\"Little boy!\"\n\nHedrick grunted unencouragingly. \"Who you callin' `little boy'?\"\n\nFor reply she began to climb the fence. It was high, but the young\nlady was astonishingly agile, and not even to be deterred by\nseveral faint wails from tearing and ripping fabrics--casualties\nwhich appeared to be entirely beneath her notice. Arriving at the\ntop rather dishevelled, and with irregular pennons here and there\nflung to the breeze from her attire, she seated herself cosily\nbeside the dumbfounded Hedrick.\n\nShe turned her face to him and smiled--and there was something\nabout her smile which Hedrick did not like. It discomforted him;\nnothing more. In sunlight he would have had the better chance to\ncomprehend; but, unhappily, this was moonshine.\n\n\"Kiss me, little boy!\" she said.\n\n\"I won't!\" exclaimed the shocked and indignant Hedrick, edging\nuneasily away from her.\n\n\"Let's play,\" she said cheerfully.\n\n\"Play what?\"\n\n\"I like chickens. Did you know I like chickens?\"\n\nThe rather singular lack of connection in her remarks struck him\nas a misplaced effort at humour.\n\n\"You're having lots of fun with me, aren't you?\" he growled.\n\nShe instantly moved close to him and lifted her face to his.\n\n\"Kiss me, darling little boy!\" she said.\n\nThere was something more than uncommonly queer about this\nstranger, an unearthliness of which he was confusedly perceptive,\nbut she was not without a curious kind of prettiness, and her pale\ngold hair was beautiful. The doomed lad saw the moon shining\nthrough it.\n\n\"Kiss me, darling little boy!\" she repeated.\n\nHis head whirled; for the moment she seemed divine.\n\nGeorge Washington used profanity at the Battle of Monmouth.\nHedrick kissed her.\n\nHe instantly pushed her away with strong distaste. \"There!\" he\nsaid angrily. \"I hope that'll satisfy you!\" He belonged to his\nsex.\n\n\"Kiss me some more, darling little boy!\" she cried, and flung her\narms about him.\n\nWith a smothered shout of dismay he tried to push her off, and\nthey fell from the fence together, into the yard, at the cost of\nfurther and almost fatal injuries to the lady's apparel.\n\nHedrick was first upon his feet. \"Haven't you got _any_ sense?\"\nhe demanded.\n\nShe smiled unwaveringly, rose (without assistance) and repeated:\n\"Kiss me some more, darling little boy!\"\n\n\"No, I won't! I wouldn't for a thousand dollars!\"\n\nApparently, she did not consider this discouraging. She began to\nadvance endearingly, while he retreated backward. \"Kiss me\nsome----\"\n\n\"I won't, I tell you!\" Hedrick kept stepping away, moving in a\ndesperate circle. He resorted to a brutal formula: \"You make me\nsick!\"\n\n\"Kiss me some more, darling lit----\"\n\n\"I won't!\" he bellowed. \"And if you say that again I'll----\"\n\n\"Kiss me some more, darling little boy!\" She flung herself at him,\nand with a yell of terror he turned and ran at top-speed.\n\nShe pursued, laughing sweetly, and calling loudly as she ran,\n\"Kiss me some more, darling little boy! Kiss me some more, darling\nlittle boy!\"\n\nThe stricken Hedrick knew not whither to direct his flight: he\ndared not dash for the street with this imminent tattered\nincubus--she was almost upon him--and he frantically made for the\nkitchen door, only to swerve with a gasp of despair as his foot\ntouched the step, for she was at his heels, and he was sickeningly\nassured she would cheerfully follow him through the house,\nshouting that damning refrain for all ears. A strangling fear took\nhim by the throat--if Cora should come to be a spectator of this\nunspeakable flight, if Cora should hear that horrid plea for love!\nThen farewell peace; indeed, farewell all joy in life forever!\n\nPanting sobbingly, he ducked under the amorous vampire's arm and\nfled on. He zigzagged desperately to and fro across the broad,\nempty backyard, a small hand ever and anon managing to clutch his\nshoulder, the awful petition in his ears:\n\n\"Kiss me some more, darling little boy!\"\n\n\"_Hedrick_!\"\n\nEmerging from the kitchen door, Laura stood and gazed in wonder as\nthe two eerie figures sped by her, circled, ducked, dodged, flew\nmadly on. This commonplace purlieu was become the scene of a\nwitch-chase; the moonlight fell upon the ghastly flitting face of\nthe pursued, uplifted in agony, white, wet, with fay eyes; also it\nillumined the unreal elf following close, a breeze-blown fantasy\nin rags.\n\n\"Kiss me some more, darling little boy!\"\n\nLaura uttered a sharp exclamation. \"Stand still, Hedrick!\" she\ncalled. \"You must!\"\n\nHedrick made a piteous effort to increase his speed.\n\n\"It's Lolita Martin,\" called Laura. \"She must have her way or\nnothing can be done with her. Stand _still_!\"\n\nHedrick had never heard of Lolita Martin, but the added\ninformation concerning her was not ineffective: it operated as a\nspur; and Laura joined the hunt.\n\n\"Stand still!\" she cried to the wretched quarry. \"She's run away.\nShe must be taken home. Stop, Hedrick! You _must_ stop!\"\n\nHedrick had no intention of stopping, but Laura was a runner, and,\nas he dodged the other, caught and held him fast. The next\ninstant, Lolita, laughing happily, flung her arms round his neck\nfrom behind.\n\n\"Lemme go!\" shuddered Hedrick. \"Lemme go!\"\n\n\"Kiss me again, darl----\"\n\n\"I--woof!\" He became inarticulate.\n\n\"She isn't quite right,\" his sister whispered hurriedly in his\near. \"She has spells when she's weak mentally. You must be kind to\nher. She only wants you to----\"\n\n\"`_Only_'!\" he echoed hoarsely. \"I won't ki----\" He was unable to\nfinish the word.\n\n\"We must get her home,\" said Laura anxiously. \"Will you come with\nme, Lolita, dear?\"\n\nApparently Lolita had no consciousness whatever of Laura's\npresence. Instead of replying, she tightened her grasp upon\nHedrick and warmly reiterated her request.\n\n\"Shut up, you parrot!\" hissed the goaded boy.\n\n\"Perhaps she'll go if you let her walk with her arms round your\nneck,\" suggested Laura.\n\n\"If I _what_?\"\n\n\"Let's try it. We've got to get her home; her mother must be\nfrantic about her. Come, let's see if she'll go with us that way.\"\n\nWith convincing earnestness, Hedrick refused to make the\nexperiment until Laura suggested that he remain with Lolita while\nshe summoned assistance; then, as no alternative appeared, his\nspirit broke utterly, and he consented to the trial, stipulating\nwith a last burst of vehemence that the progress of the\nunthinkable pageant should be through the alley.\n\n\"Come, Lolita,\" said Laura coaxingly. \"We're going for a nice\nwalk.\" At the adjective, Hedrick's burdened shoulders were racked\nwith a brief spasm, which recurred as his sister added: \"Your\ndarling little boy will let you keep hold of him.\"\n\nLolita seemed content. Laughing gayly, she offered no opposition,\nbut, maintaining her embrace with both arms and walking somewhat\nsidewise, went willingly enough; and the three slowly crossed the\nyard, passed through the empty stable and out into the alley. When\nthey reached the cross-street at the alley's upper end, Hedrick\nbalked flatly.\n\nLaura expostulated, then entreated. Hedrick refused with sincere\nloathing to be seen upon the street occupying his present position\nin the group. Laura assured him that there was no one to see; he\nreplied that the moon was bright and the evening early; he would\ndie, and readily, but he would not set foot in the street.\nUnfortunately, he had selected an unfavourable spot for argument:\nthey were already within a yard or two of the street; and a\nstrange boy, passing, stopped and observed, and whistled\ndiscourteously.\n\n\"Ain't he the spooner!\" remarked this unknown with hideous\nadmiration.\n\n\"I'll thank you,\" returned Hedrick haughtily, \"to go on about your\nown business.\"\n\n\"Kiss me some more, darling little boy!\" said Lolita.\n\nThe strange boy squawked, wailed, screamed with laughter, howled\nthe loving petition in a dozen keys of mockery, while Hedrick\nwrithed and Lolita clung. Enriched by a new and great experience,\nthe torturer trotted on, leaving viperish cachinnations in his\nwake.\n\nBut the martyrdom was at an end. A woman, hurrying past,\nbareheaded, was greeted by a cry of delight from Lolita, who\nreleased Hedrick and ran to her with outstretched arms.\n\n\"We were bringing her home, Mrs. Martin,\" said Laura,\nreassuringly. \"She's all right; nothing's the matter except that\nher dress got torn. We found her playing in our yard.\"\n\n\"I thank you a thousand times, Miss Madison,\" cried Lolita's\nmother, and flutteringly plunged into a description of her\nanxiety, her search for Lolita, and concluded with renewed\nexpressions of gratitude for the child's safe return, an\noutpouring of thankfulness and joy wholly incomprehensible to\nHedrick.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Laura cheerfully. \"Come, Hedrick. We'll go home\nby the street, I think.\" She touched his shoulder, and he went\nwith her in stunned obedience. He was not able to face the\nincredible thing that had happened to him: he walked in a trance\nof horror.\n\n\"Poor little girl!\" said Laura gently, with what seemed to her\nbrother an indefensibly misplaced compassion. \"Usually they have\nher live in an institution for people afflicted as she is, but\nthey brought her home for a visit last week, I believe. Of course\nyou didn't understand, but I think you should have been more\nthoughtful. Really, you shouldn't have flirted with her.\"\n\nHedrick stopped short.\n\n\"`_Flirted_'!\" His voice was beginning to show symptoms of\nchanging, this year; it rose to a falsetto wail, flickered and\nwent out.\n\nWith the departure of Lolita in safety, what had seemed bizarre\nand piteous became obscured, and another aspect of the adventure\nwas presented to Laura. The sufferings of the arrogant are not\nwholly depressing to the spectator; and of arrogance Hedrick had\never been a master. She began to shake; a convulsion took her, and\nsuddenly she sat upon the curbstone without dignity, and laughed\nas he had never seen her.\n\nA horrid distrust of her rose within him: he began to realize in\nwhat plight he stood, what terrors o'erhung.\n\n\"Look here,\" he said miserably, \"are you--you aren't--you don't\nhave to go and--and _talk_ about this, do you?\"\n\n\"No, Hedrick,\" she responded, rising and controlling herself\nsomewhat. \"Not so long as you're good.\"\n\nThis was no reassuring answer.\n\n\"And politer to Cora,\" she added.\n\nSeemingly he heard the lash of a slave-whip crack in the air. The\nfuture grew dark.\n\n\"I know you'll try\"--she said; and the unhappy lad felt that her\nassurance was justified; but she had not concluded the\nsentence--\"darling little boy,\" she capped it, choking slightly.\n\n\"No other little girl ever fell in love with you, did there,\nHedrick?\" she asked, and, receiving an incoherent but furious\nreply, she was again overcome, so that she must lean against the\nfence to recover. \"It seems--so--so _curious_,\" she explained,\ngasping, \"that the first one--the--the only one--should be\nan--a--an----\" She was unable to continue.\n\nHedrick's distrust became painfully increased: he began to feel\nthat he disliked Laura.\n\nShe was still wiping her eyes and subject to recurrent outbursts\nwhen they reached their own abode; and as he bitterly flung\nhimself into a chair upon the vacant front porch, he heard her\nstifling an attack as she mounted the stairs to her own room. He\nswung the chair about, with its back to the street, and sat facing\nthe wall. He saw nothing. There are profundities in the abyss\nwhich reveal no glimpse of the sky.\n\nPresently he heard his father coughing near by; and the sound was\nhateful, because it seemed secure and unshamed. It was a cough of\nmoral superiority; and just then the son would have liked to\nbelieve that his parent's boyhood had been one of degradation as\ncomplete as his own; but no one with this comfortable cough could\never have plumbed such depths: his imagination refused the picture\nhe was bitterly certain that Mr. Madison had never kissed an\nidiot.\n\nHedrick had a dread that his father might speak to him; he was in\nno condition for light conversation. But Mr. Madison was unaware\nof his son's near presence, and continued upon his purposeless\nway. He was smoking his one nightly cigar and enjoying the\nmoonlight. He drifted out toward the sidewalk and was accosted by\na passing acquaintance, a comfortable burgess of sixty, leading a\nchild of six or seven, by the hand.\n\n\"Out taking the air, are you, Mr. Madison?\" said the pedestrian,\npausing.\n\n\"Yes; just trying to cool off,\" returned the other. \"How are you,\nPryor, anyway? I haven't seen you for a long time.\"\n\n\"Not since last summer,\" said Pryor. \"I only get here once or\ntwice a year, to see my married daughter. I always try to spend\nAugust with her if I can. She's still living in that little house,\nover on the next street, I bought for her through your real-estate\ncompany. I suppose you're still in the same business?\"\n\n\"Yes. Pretty slack, these days.\"\n\n\"I suppose so, I suppose so,\" responded Mr. Pryor, nodding.\n\"Summer, I suppose it usually is. Well, I don't know when I'll be\ngoing out on the road again myself. Business is pretty slack all\nover the country this year.\"\n\n\"Let's see--I've forgotten,\" said Madison ruminatively. \"You\ntravel, don't you?\"\n\n\"For a New York house,\" affirmed Mr. Pryor. He did not, however,\nmention his \"line.\" \"Yes-sir,\" he added, merely as a decoration,\nand then said briskly: \"I see you have a fine family, Mr. Madison;\nyes-sir, a fine family; I've passed here several times lately and\nI've noticed 'em: fine family. Let's see, you've got four, haven't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Three,\" said Madison. \"Two girls and a boy.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, that's mighty nice,\" observed Mr. Pryor; \"_mighty_\nnice! I only have my one daughter, and of course me living in New\nYork when I'm at home, and her here, why, I don't get to see much\nof her. You got both your daughters living with you, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, right here at home.\"\n\n\"Let's see: neither of 'em's married, I believe?\"\n\n\"No; not yet.\"\n\n\"Seems to me now,\" said Pryor, taking off his glasses and wiping\nthem, \"seems to me I did hear somebody say one of 'em was going to\nbe married engaged, maybe.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Madison. \"Not that I know of.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose you'd be the first to know! Yes-sir.\" And both\nmen laughed their appreciation of this folly. \"They're mighty\ngood-looking girls, _that's_ certain,\" continued Mr. Pryor. \"And\none of 'em's as fine a dresser as you'll meet this side the Rue de\nla Paix.\"\n\n\"You mean in Paris?\" asked Madison, slightly surprised at this\nallusion. \"You've been over there, Pryor?\"\n\n\"Oh, sometimes,\" was the response. \"My business takes me over, now\nand then. I _think_ it's one of your daughters I've noticed\ndresses so well. Isn't one of 'em a mighty pretty girl about\ntwenty-one or two, with a fine head of hair sort of lightish\nbrown, beautiful figure, and carries a white parasol with a green\nlining sometimes?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's Cora, I guess.\"\n\n\"Pretty name, too,\" said Pryor approvingly. \"Yes-sir. I saw her\ngoing into a florist's, downtown, the other day, with a\nfine-looking young fellow--I can't think of his name. Let's see:\nmy daughter was with me, and she'd heard his name--said his family\nused to be big people in this town and----\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Madison, \"young Corliss.\"\n\n\"Corliss!\" exclaimed Mr. Pryor, with satisfaction. \"That's it,\nCorliss. Well, sir,\" he chuckled, \"from the way he was looking at\nyour Miss Cora it struck me he seemed kind of anxious for her name\nto be Corliss, too.\"\n\n\"Well, hardly I expect,\" said the other. \"They just barely know\neach other: he's only been here a few weeks; they haven't had time\nto get much acquainted, you see.\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" agreed Mr. Pryor, with perfect readiness. \"I\nsuppose not. I'll bet _he_ tries all he can to get acquainted\nthough; he looked pretty smart to me. Doesn't he come about as\noften as the law allows?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't be surprised,\" said Madison indifferently. \"He\ndoesn't know many people about here any more, and it's lonesome\nfor him at the hotel. But I guess he comes to see the whole\nfamily; I left him in the library a little while ago, talking to\nmy wife.\"\n\n\"That's the way! Get around the old folks first!\" Mr. Pryor\nchuckled cordially; then in a mildly inquisitive tone he said:\n\"Seems to be a fine, square young fellow, I expect?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so.\"\n\n\"Pretty name, `Cora',\" said Pryor.\n\n\"What's this little girl's name?\" Mr. Madison indicated the child,\nwho had stood with heroic patience throughout the incomprehensible\ndialogue.\n\n\"Lottie, for her mother. She's a good little girl.\"\n\n\"She is _so_! I've got a young son she ought to know,\" remarked\nMr. Madison serenely, with an elderly father's total\nunconsciousness of the bridgeless gap between seven and thirteen.\n\"He'd like to play with her. I'll call him.\"\n\n\"I expect we better be getting on,\" said Pryor. \"It's near\nLottie's bedtime; we just came out for our evening walk.\"\n\n\"Well, he can come and shake hands with her anyway,\" urged\nHedrick's father. \"Then they'll know each other, and they can play\nsome other time.\" He turned toward the house and called loudly:\n\n\"Hedrick!\"\n\nThere was no response. Behind the back of his chair Hedrick could\nnot be seen. He was still sitting immovable, his eyes torpidly\nfixed upon the wall.\n\n\"Hed-_rick_!\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Oh, _Hed_-rick!\" shouted his father. \"Come out here! I want you\nto meet a little girl! Come and see a nice little girl!\"\n\nMr. Pryor's grandchild was denied the pleasure. At the ghastly\nwords \"_little girl_,\" Hedrick dropped from his chair flat upon\nthe floor, crawled to the end of the porch, wriggled through the\nrailing, and immersed himself in deep shadow against the side of\nthe house.\n\nHere he removed his shoes, noiselessly mounted to the sill of one\nof the library windows, then reconnoitred through a slit in the\nblinds before entering.\n\nThe gas burned low in the \"drop-light\"--almost too dimly to reveal\nthe two people upon a sofa across the room. It was a faint murmur\nfrom one of them that caused Hedrick to pause and peer more\nsharply. They were Cora and Corliss; he was bending close to her;\nher face was lifting to his.\n\n\"Ah, kiss me! Kiss me!\" she whispered.\n\nHedrick dropped from the sill, climbed through a window of the\nkitchen, hurried up the back-stairs, and reached his own apartment\nin time to be violently ill in seclusion.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE\n\nVillages are scattered plentifully over the unstable buttresses of\nVesuvius, and the inhabitants sleep o' nights: Why not? Quite\nunaware that he was much of their condition, Mr. Madison bade his\nincidental gossip and the tiny Lottie good-night, and sought his\nearly bed. He maintained in good faith that Saturday night was \"a\ngreat night to sleep,\" because of the later hour for rising;\nprobably having also some factitious conviction that there\nprevailed a hush preparative of the Sabbath. As a matter of fact,\nin summer, the other members of his family always looked\nuncommonly haggard at the Sunday breakfast-table. Accepting\nwithout question his preposterous legend of additional matutinal\nslumber, they postponed retiring to a late hour, and were\nawakened--simultaneously with thousands of fellow-sufferers--at\nabout half-after five on Sunday morning, by a journalistic\nuprising. Over the town, in these early hours, rampaged the small\nvendors of the manifold sheets: local papers and papers from\ngreater cities, hawker succeeding hawker with yell upon yell and\nbrain-piercing shrillings in unbearable cadences. No good burgher\never complained: the people bore it, as in winter they bore the\nsmoke that injured their health, ruined their linen, spoiled their\ncomplexions, forbade all hope of beauty and comfort in their city,\nand destroyed the sweetness of their homes and of their wives. It\nis an incredibly patient citizenry and exalts its persecutors.\n\nOf the Madison family, Cora probably suffered most; and this was\nthe time when it was no advantage to have the front bedroom. She\nhad not slept until close upon dawn, and the hawkers woke her\nirreparably; she could but rage upon her hot pillow. By and by,\nthere came a token that another anguish kept company with hers.\nShe had left her door open for a better circulation of the warm\nand languid air, and from Hedrick's room issued an \"_oof_!\" of\nagonized disgust. Cora little suspected that the youth reeked not\nof newsboys: Hedrick's miseries were introspective.\n\nThe cries from the street were interminable; each howler in turn\nheard faintly in the distance, then in crescendo until he had\npassed and another succeeded him, and all the while Cora lay\ntossing and whispering between clenched teeth. Having ample\nreason, that morning, to prefer sleep to thinking, sleep was\nimpossible. But she fought for it: she did not easily surrender\nwhat she wanted; and she struggled on, with closed eyes, long\nafter she had heard the others go down to breakfast.\n\nAbout a hundred yards from her windows, to the rear, were the open\nwindows of a church which fronted the next street, and stood\ndos-a-dos to the dwelling of the Madisons. The Sunday-school hour\nhad been advanced for the hot weather, and, partly on this\naccount, and partly because of the summer absence of many\nfamilies, the attendants were few. But the young voices were\nconducted, rather than accompanied, in pious melody by a cornetist\nwho worthily thought to amend, in his single person, what lack of\nvolume this paucity occasioned. He was a slender young man in hot\nblack clothes; he wore the unfacaded collar fatally and\nunanimously adopted by all adam's-apple men of morals; he was\nwashed, fair, flat-skulled, clean-minded, and industrious; and the\nonly noise of any kind he ever made in the world was on Sunday.\n\n\"Prashus joowuls, sweet joowuls, _thee_ jams off iz crowowun,\"\nsang the little voices feebly. They were almost unheard; but the\nyoung man helped them out: figuratively, he put them out. And the\ncornet was heard: it was heard for blocks and blocks; it was heard\nover all that part of the town--in the vicinity of the church it\nwas the only thing that could be heard. In his daily walk this\ncornetist had no enemies: he was kind-hearted; he would not have\nshot a mad dog; he gladly nursed the sick. He sat upon the\nplatform before the children; he swelled, perspired and blew, and\nfelt that it was a good blowing. If other thoughts vapoured upon\nthe borders of his mind, they were of the dinner he would eat,\nsoon after noon, at the house of one of the frilled, white-muslin\nteachers. He was serene. His eyes were not blasted; his heart was\nnot instantly withered; his thin, bluish hair did not fall from\nhis head; his limbs were not detached from his torso--yet these\nmisfortunes had been desired for him, with comprehension and\nsincerity, at the first flat blat of his brassy horn.\n\nIt is impossible to imagine the state of mind of this young\ncornetist, could he have known that he had caused the prettiest\ngirl in town to jump violently out of bed with what petitions upon\nher lips regarding his present whereabouts and future detention!\nIt happened that during the course of his Sunday walk on Corliss\nStreet, that very afternoon, he saw her--was hard-smitten by her\nbeauty, and for weeks thereafter laid unsuccessful plans to \"meet\"\nher. Her image was imprinted: he talked about her to his\nboarding-house friends and office acquaintances, his favourite\ndescription being, \"the sweetest-looking lady I ever laid eyes\non.\"\n\nCora, descending to the breakfast-table rather white herself, was\nnot unpleasantly shocked by the haggard aspect of Hedrick, who,\nwith Laura and Mrs. Madison, still lingered.\n\n\"Good-morning, Cora,\" he said politely, and while she stared, in\nsuspicious surprise, he passed her a plate of toast with\nostentatious courtesy; but before she could take one of the\nslices, \"Wait,\" he said; \"it's very nice toast, but I'm afraid it\nisn't hot. I'll take it to the kitchen and have it warmed for\nyou.\" And he took the plate and went out, walking softly.\n\nCora turned to her mother, appalled. \"He'll be sick!\" she said.\n\nMrs. Madison shook her head and smiled sadly.\n\n\"He helped to wait on all of us: he must have been doing something\nawful.\"\n\n\"More likely he wants permission to do something awful.\"\n\nLaura looked out of the window.\n\n\"There, Cora,\" said Hedrick kindly, when he brought the toast;\n\"you'll find that nice and hot.\"\n\nShe regarded him steadfastly, but with modesty he avoided her eye.\n\"You wouldn't make such a radical change in your nature, Hedrick,\"\nshe said, with a puzzled frown, \"just to get out of going to\nchurch, would you?\"\n\n\"I don't want to get out of going to church,\" he said. He gulped\nslightly. \"I like church.\"\n\nAnd church-time found him marching decorously beside his father,\nthe three ladies forming a rear rank; a small company in the very\nthin procession of fanning women and mopping men whose destination\nwas the gray stone church at the foot of Corliss Street. The\nlocusts railed overhead: Hedrick looked neither to the right nor\nto the left.\n\nThey passed a club, of which a lower window was vacated\nsimultaneously with their coming into view; and a small but ornate\nfigure in pale gray crash hurried down the steps and attached\nitself to the second row of Madisons. \"Good-morning,\" said Mr.\nWade Trumble. \"Thought I'd take a look-in at church this morning\nmyself.\"\n\nCare of this encumbrance was usually expected of Laura and Mrs.\nMadison, but to their surprise Cora offered a sprightly rejoinder\nand presently dropped behind them with Mr. Trumble. Mr. Trumble\nwas also surprised and, as naively, pleased.\n\n\"What's happened?\" he asked with cheerful frankness. \"You haven't\ngiven me a chance to talk to you for a long while.\"\n\n\"Haven't I?\" she smiled enigmatically. \"I don't think you've tried\nvery hard.\"\n\nThis was too careless; it did not quite serve, even for Trumble.\n\"What's up?\" he asked, not without shrewdness. \"Is Richard Lindley\nout of town?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"I see. Perhaps it's this new chap, Corliss? Has he left?\"\n\n\"What nonsense! What have they got to do with my being nice to\nyou?\" She gave him a dangerous smile, and it wrought upon him\nvisibly.\n\n\"Don't you ever be nice to me unless you mean it,\" he said feebly.\n\nCora looked grave and sweet; she seemed mysteriously moved. \"I\nnever do anything I don't mean,\" she said in a low voice which\nthrilled the little man. This was machine-work, easy and accurate.\n\n\"Cora----\" he began, breathlessly.\n\n\"There!\" she exclaimed, shifting on the instant to a lively\nbrusqueness. \"That's enough for you just _now_. We're on our way\nto church!\"\n\nTrumble felt almost that she had accepted him.\n\n\"Have you got your penny for the contribution box?\" she smiled. \"I\nsuppose you really give a great deal to the church. I hear you're\nricher and richer.\"\n\n\"I do pretty well,\" he returned, coolly. \"You can know just how\nwell, if you like.\"\n\n\"Not on Sunday,\" she laughed; then went on, admiringly, \"I hear\nyou're very dashing in your speculations.\"\n\n\"Then you've heard wrong, because I don't speculate,\" he returned.\n\"I'm not a gambler--except on certainties. I guess I disappointed\na friend of yours the other day because I wouldn't back him on a\nthousand-to-one shot.\"\n\n\"Who was that?\" she asked, with an expression entirely veiled.\n\n\"Corliss. He came to see me; wanted me to put real money into an\noil scheme. Too thin!\"\n\n\"Why is it `too thin'?\" she asked carelessly.\n\n\"Too far away, for one thing--somewhere in Italy. Anybody who put\nup his cash would have to do it on Corliss's bare word that he's\nstruck oil.\"\n\n\"Well?\" She turned her face to him, and a faint perturbation was\nmanifest in her tone. \"Isn't Mr. Corliss's `bare word' supposed to\nbe perfectly good?\"\n\n\"Oh, I suppose so, but I don't know. He isn't known here: nobody\nreally knows anything about him except that he was born here.\nBesides, I wouldn't make an investment on my own father's bare\nword, if he happened to be alive.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not!\" Cora spoke impulsively, a sudden anger getting the\nbetter of her, but she controlled it immediately. \"Of course I\ndon't mean that,\" she laughed, sweetly. \"But _I_ happen to think\nMr. Corliss's scheme a very handsome one, and I want my friends to\nmake their fortunes, of course. Richard Lindley and papa are going\ninto it.\"\n\n\"I'll bet they don't,\" said Trumble promptly. \"Lindley told me\nhe'd looked it over and couldn't see his way to.\"\n\n\"He did?\" Cora stiffened perceptibly and bit her lip.\n\nTrumble began to laugh. \"This is funny: you trying to talk\nbusiness! So Corliss has been telling you about it?\"\n\n\"Yes, he has; and I understand it perfectly. I think there's an\nenormous fortune in it, and you'd better not laugh at me: a\nwoman's instinct about such things is better than a man's\nexperience sometimes.\"\n\n\"You'll find neither Lindley nor your father are going to think\nso,\" he returned skeptically.\n\nShe gave him a deep, sweet look. \"But I mustn't be disappointed in\nyou,\" she said, with the suggestion of a tremor in her voice,\n\"whatever _they_ do! You'll take my advice, won't you--Wade?\"\n\n\"I'll take your advice in anything but business.\" He shook his\nhead ominously.\n\n\"And wouldn't you take my advice in business,\"--she asked very\nslowly and significantly--\"under _any_ circumstances?\"\n\n\"You mean,\" he said huskily, \"if you were my wife?\"\n\nShe looked away, and slightly inclined her head. \"No,\" he answered\ndoggedly, \"I wouldn't. You know mighty well that's what I want you\nto be, and I'd give my soul for the tip of your shoe, but business\nis an entirely different matter, and I----\"\n\n\"_Wade_!\" she said, with wonderful and thrilling sweetness. They\nhad reached the church; Hedrick and his father had entered; Mrs.\nMadison and Laura were waiting on the steps. Cora and Trumble came\nto a stop some yards away. \"Wade, I--I _want_ you to go into\nthis.\"\n\n\"Can't do it,\" he said stubbornly. \"If you ever make up your mind\nto marry me, I'll spend all the money you like on _you_, but\nyou'll have to keep to the woman's side of the house.\"\n\n\"You make it pretty hard for me to be nice to you,\" she returned,\nand the tremor now more evident in her voice was perfectly\ngenuine. \"You positively refuse to do this--for me?\"\n\n\"Yes I do. I wouldn't buy sight-unseen to please God 'lmighty,\nCora Madison.\" He looked at her shrewdly, struck by a sudden\nthought. \"Did Corliss ask you to try and get me in?\"\n\n\"He did not,\" she responded, icily. \"Your refusal is final?\"\n\n\"Certainly!\" He struck the pavement a smart rap with his\nwalking-stick. \"By George, I believe he _did_ ask you! That spoils\nchurch for me this morning; I'll not go in. When you quit playing\ngames, let me know. You needn't try to work me any more, because I\nwon't stand for it, but if you ever get tired of playing, come and\ntell me so.\" He uttered a bark of rueful laughter. \"Ha! I must say\nthat gentleman has an interesting way of combining business with\npleasure!\"\n\nUnder favourable circumstances the blow Cora dealt him might have\nbeen physically more violent. \"Good-morning,\" she laughed, gayly.\n\"I'm not bothering much about Mr. Corliss's oil in Italy. I had a\nbet with Laura I could keep you from saying `I beg to differ,' or\ntalking about the weather for five minutes. She'll have to pay\nme!\"\n\nThen, still laughing, she lowered her parasol, and with superb\nimpudence, brushed it smartly across his face; turned on her heel,\nand, red with fury, joined her mother and sister, and went into\nthe church.\n\nThe service failed to occupy her attention: she had much in her\nthoughts to distract her. Nevertheless, she bestowed some\nwonderment upon the devotion with which her brother observed each\nceremonial rite. He joined in prayer with real fervour; he sang\nearnestly and loudly; a great appeal sounded in his changing\nvoice; and during the sermon he sat with his eyes upon the\nminister in a stricken fixity. All this was so remarkable that\nCora could not choose but ponder upon it, and, observing Hedrick\nfurtively, she caught, if not a clue itself, at least a glimpse of\none. She saw Laura's clear profile becoming subtly agitated; then\nnoticed a shimmer of Laura's dark eye as it wandered to Hedrick\nand so swiftly away it seemed not to dare to remain. Cora was\nquick: she perceived that Laura was repressing a constant desire\nto laugh and that she feared to look at Hedrick lest it overwhelm\nher. So Laura knew what had wrought the miracle. Cora made up her\nmind to explore this secret passage.\n\nWhen the service was over and the people were placidly buzzing\ntheir way up the aisles, Cora felt herself drawn to look across\nthe church, and following the telepathic impulse, turned her head\nto encounter the gaze of Ray Vilas. He was ascending the opposite\naisle, walking beside Richard Lindley. He looked less pale than\nusual, though his thinness was so extreme it was like emaciation;\nbut his eyes were clear and quiet, and the look he gave her was\nstrangely gentle. Cora frowned and turned away her head with an\nair of annoyance. They came near each other in the convergence at\nthe doors; but he made no effort to address her, and, moving away\nthrough the crowd as quickly as possible, disappeared.\n\nValentine Corliss was disclosed in the vestibule. He reached her\nan instant in advance of Mr. Lindley, who had suffered himself to\nbe impeded; and Cora quickly handed the former her parasol,\nlightly taking his arm. Thus the slow Richard found himself\nwalking beside Laura in a scattered group, its detached portion\nconsisting of his near-betrothed and Corliss; for although the\ndexterous pair were first to leave the church, they contrived to\nbe passed almost at once, and, assuming the position of trailers,\nlagged far behind on the homeward way.\n\nLaura and Richard walked in the unmitigated glare of the sun; he\nhad taken her black umbrella and conscientiously held it aloft,\nbut over nobody. They walked in silence: they were quiet people,\nboth of them; and Richard, not \"talkative\" under any\ncircumstances, never had anything whatever to say to Laura\nMadison. He had known her for many years, ever since her\nchildhood; seldom indeed formulating or expressing a definite\nthought about her, though sometimes it was vaguely of his\nconsciousness that she played the piano nicely, and even then her\nmusic had taken its place as but a colour of Cora's background.\nFor to him, as to every one else (including Laura), Laura was in\nnothing her sister's competitor. She was a neutral-tinted figure,\ntaken-for-granted, obscured, and so near being nobody at all,\nthat, as Richard Lindley walked beside her this morning, he\nglanced back at the lagging couple and uttered a long and almost\nsonorous sigh, which he would have been ashamed for anybody to\nhear; and then actually proceeded on his way without the slightest\nrealization that anybody had heard it.\n\nShe understood. And she did not disturb the trance; she did\nnothing to make him observe that she was there. She walked on with\nhead, shoulders, and back scorching in the fierce sun, and allowed\nhim to continue shading the pavement before them with her\numbrella. When they reached the house she gently took the umbrella\nfrom him and thanked him; and he mechanically raised his hat.\n\nThey had walked more than a mile together; he had not spoken a\nword, and he did not even know it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN\n\nDinner on Sunday, the most elaborate feast of the week for the\nMadisons, was always set for one o'clock in the afternoon, and\nsometimes began before two, but not to-day: the escorts of both\ndaughters remained, and a change of costume by Cora occasioned a\nlong postponement. Justice demands the admission that her\nreappearance in a glamour of lilac was reward for the delay;\nnothing more ravishing was ever seen, she was warrantably informed\nby the quicker of the two guests, in a moment's whispered\ntete-a-tete across the banisters as she descended. Another wait\nfollowed while she prettily arranged upon the table some dozens of\nasters from a small garden-bed, tilled, planted, and tended by\nLaura. Meanwhile, Mrs. Madison constantly turned the other cheek\nto the cook. Laura assisted in the pacification; Hedrick froze the\nice-cream to an impenetrable solidity; and the nominal head of the\nfamily sat upon the front porch with the two young men, and wiped\nhis wrists and rambled politically till they were summoned to the\ndining-room.\n\nCora did the talking for the table. She was in high spirits; no\ntrace remained of a haggard night: there was a bloom upon her--she\nwas radiant. Her gayety may have had some inspiration in her\ndaring, for round her throat she wore a miraculously slender chain\nof gold and enamel, with a pendant of minute pale sapphires\nscrolled about a rather large and very white diamond. Laura\nstarted when she saw it, and involuntarily threw a glance almost\nof terror at Richard Lindley. But that melancholy and\nabsent-minded gentleman observed neither the glance nor the jewel.\nHe saw Cora's eyes, when they were vouchsafed to his vision, and\nwhen they were not he apparently saw nothing at all.\n\nWith the general exodus from the table, Cora asked Laura to come\nto the piano and play, a request which brought a snort from\nHedrick, who was taken off his guard. Catching Laura's eye, he\napplied a handkerchief with renewed presence of mind, affecting to\nhave sneezed, and stared searchingly over it at Corliss. He\nperceived that the man remained unmoved, evidently already\ninformed that it was Laura who was the musician. Cora must be\ngoing it pretty fast this time: such was the form of her brother's\ndeduction.\n\nWhen Laura opened the piano, Richard had taken a seat beside Cora,\nand Corliss stood leaning in the doorway. The player lost herself\nin a wandering medley, echoes from \"Boheme\" and \"Pagliacci\"; then\ndrifted into improvisation and played her heart into it\nmagnificently--a heart released to happiness. The still air of the\nroom filled with wonderful, golden sound: a song like the song of\na mother flying from earth to a child in the stars, a torrential\ntenderness, unpent and glorying in freedom. The flooding,\ntriumphant chords rose, crashed--stopped with a shattering\nabruptness. Laura's hands fell to her sides, then were raised to\nher glowing face and concealed it for a moment. She shivered; a\nquick, deep sigh heaved her breast; and she came back to herself\nlike a prisoner leaving a window at the warden's voice.\n\nShe turned. Cora and Corliss had left the room. Richard was\nsitting beside a vacant chair, staring helplessly at the open\ndoor.\n\nIf he had been vaguely conscious of Laura's playing, which is\npossible, certainly he was unaware that it had ceased.\n\n\"The others have gone out to the porch,\" she said composedly, and\nrose. \"Shan't we join them?\"\n\n\"What?\" he returned, blankly. \"I beg your pardon----\"\n\n\"Let's go out on the porch with the others.\"\n\n\"No, I----\" He got to his feet confusedly. \"I was thinking---- I\nbelieve I'd best be going home.\"\n\n\"Not `best,' I think,\" she said. \"Not even better!\"\n\n\"I don't see,\" he said, his perplexity only increased.\n\n\"Mr. Corliss would,\" she retorted quickly. \"Come on: we'll go and\nsit with them.\" And she compelled his obedience by preceding him\nwith such a confident assumption that he would follow that he did.\n\nThe fugitive pair were not upon the porch, however; they were\ndiscovered in the shade of a tree behind the house, seated upon a\nrug, and occupied in a conversation which would not have disturbed\na sick-room. The pursuers came upon them, boldly sat beside them;\nand Laura began to talk with unwonted fluency to Corliss, but\nwithin five minutes found herself alone with Richard Lindley upon\nthe rug. Cora had promised to show Mr. Corliss an \"old print\" in\nthe library--so Cora said.\n\nLindley gave the remaining lady a desolate and faintly reproachful\nlook. He was kind, but he was a man; and Laura saw that this last\nabandonment was being attributed in part to her.\n\nShe reddened, and, being not an angel, observed with crispness:\n\"Certainly. You're quite right: it's my fault!\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" he asked vacantly.\n\nShe looked at him rather fixedly; his own gaze had returned to the\nangle of the house beyond which the other couple had just\ndisappeared. \"I said,\" she answered, slowly, \"I thought it\nwouldn't rain this, afternoon.\"\n\nHis wistful eyes absently swept the serene sky which had been\ncloudless for several days. \"No, I suppose not,\" he murmured.\n\n\"Richard,\" she said with a little sharpness, \"will you please\nlisten to me for a moment?\"\n\n\"Oh--what?\" He was like a diver coming up out of deep water. \"What\ndid you say?\" He laughed apologetically. \"Wasn't I listening? I\nbeg your pardon. What is it, Laura?\"\n\n\"Why do you let Mr. Corliss take Cora away from you like that?\"\nshe asked gravely.\n\n\"He doesn't,\" the young man returned with a rueful shake of the\nhead. \"Don't you see? It's Cora that goes.\"\n\n\"Why do you let her, then?\"\n\nHe sighed. \"I don't seem to be able to keep up with Cora,\nespecially when she's punishing me. I couldn't do something she\nasked me to, last night----\"\n\n\"Invest with Mr. Corliss?\" asked Laura quickly.\n\n\"Yes. It seemed to trouble her that I couldn't. She's convinced\nit's a good thing: she thinks it would make a great fortune for\nus----\"\n\n\"`Us'?\" repeated Laura gently. \"You mean for you and her? When\nyou're----\"\n\n\"When we're married. Yes,\" he said thoughtfully, \"that's the way\nshe stated it. She wanted me to put in all I have----\"\n\n\"Don't do it!\" said Laura decidedly.\n\nHe glanced at her with sharp inquiry. \"Do you mean you would\ndistrust Mr. Corliss?\"\n\n\"I wasn't thinking of that: I don't know whether I'd trust him or\nnot--I think I wouldn't; there's something veiled about him, and I\ndon't believe he is an easy man to know. What I meant was that I\ndon't believe it would really be a good thing for you with Cora.\"\n\n\"It would please her, of course--thinking I deferred so much to\nher judgment.\"\n\n\"Don't do it!\" she said again, impulsively.\n\n\"I don't see how I can,\" he returned sorrowfully.\n\n\"It's my work for all the years since I got out of college, and if\nI lost it I'd have to begin all over again. It would mean\npostponing everything. Cora isn't a girl you can ask to share a\nlittle salary, and if it were a question of years, perhaps--\nperhaps Cora might not feel she could wait for me, you see.\"\n\nHe made this explanation with plaintive and boyish sincerity,\nhesitatingly, and as if pleading a cause. And Laura, after a long\nlook at him, turned away, and in her eyes were actual tears of\ncompassion for the incredible simpleton.\n\n\"I see,\" she said. \"Perhaps she might not.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he went on, \"she's fond of having nice things, and\nshe thinks this is a great chance for us to be millionaires; and\nthen, too, I think she may feel that it would please Mr. Corliss\nand help to save him from disappointment. She seems to have taken\na great fancy to him.\"\n\nLaura glanced at him, but did not speak.\n\n\"He _is_ attractive,\" continued Richard feebly. \"I think he has a\ngreat deal of what people call `magnetism': he's the kind of man\nwho somehow makes you want to do what he wants you to. He seems a\nmanly, straightforward sort, too--so far as one can tell--and when\nhe came to me with his scheme I was strongly inclined to go into\nit. But it is too big a gamble, and I can't, though I was sorry to\ndisappoint him myself. He was perfectly cheerful about it and so\npleasant it made me feel small. I don't wonder at all that Cora\nlikes him so much. Besides, he seems to understand her.\"\n\nLaura looked very grave. \"I think he does,\" she said slowly.\n\n\"And then he's `different,'\" said Richard. \"He's more a `man of\nthe world' than most of us here: she never saw anything just like\nhim before, and she's seen _us_ all her life. She likes change, of\ncourse. That's natural,\" he said gently. \"Poor Vilas says she\nwants a man to be different every day, and if he isn't, then she\nwants a different man every day.\"\n\n\"You've rather taken Ray Vilas under your wing, haven't you?\"\nasked Laura.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" he answered deprecatingly. \"I only try to keep him with\nme so he'll stay away from downtown as much as possible.\"\n\n\"Does he talk much of Cora?\"\n\n\"All the time. There's no stopping him. I suppose he can't help\nit, because he thinks of nothing else.\"\n\n\"Isn't that rather--rather queer for you?\"\n\n\"`Queer'?\" he repeated.\n\n\"No, I suppose not!\" She laughed impatiently. \"And probably you\ndon't think it's `queer' of you to sit here helplessly, and let\nanother man take your place----\"\n\n\"But I don't `let' him, Laura,\" he protested.\n\n\"No, he just does it!\"\n\n\"Well,\" he smiled, \"you must admit my efforts to supplant him\nhaven't----\"\n\n\"It won't take any effort now,\" she said, rising quickly.\nValentine Corliss came into their view upon the sidewalk in front,\ntaking his departure. Seeing that they observed him, he lifted his\nhat to Laura and nodded a cordial good-day to Lindley. Then he\nwent on.\n\nJust before he reached the corner of the lot, he encountered upon\nthe pavement a citizen of elderly and plain appearance, strolling\nwith a grandchild. The two men met and passed, each upon his\nopposite way, without pausing and without salutation, and neither\nRichard nor Laura, whose eyes were upon the meeting, perceived\nthat they had taken cognizance of each other. But one had asked a\nquestion and the other had answered.\n\nMr. Pryor spoke in a low monotone, with a rapidity as singular as\nthe restrained but perceptible emphasis he put upon one word of\nhis question.\n\n\"I got you in the park,\" he said; and it is to be deduced that\n\"got\" was argot. \"You're not _doing_ anything here, are you?\"\n\n\"No!\" answered Corliss with condensed venom, his back already to\nthe other. He fanned himself with his hat as he went on. Mr. Pryor\nstrolled up the street with imperturbable benevolence.\n\n\"Your coast is cleared,\" said Laura, \"since you wouldn't clear it\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Wish me luck,\" said Richard as he left her.\n\nShe nodded brightly.\n\nBefore he disappeared, he looked back to her again (which\nprofoundly surprised her) and smiled rather disconsolately,\nshaking his head as in prophecy of no very encouraging reception\nindoors. The manner of this glance recalled to Laura what his\nmother had once said of him. \"Richard is one of those sweet,\nhelpless men that some women adore and others despise. They fall\nin love with the ones that despise them.\"\n\nAn ostentatious cough made her face about, being obviously\ndesigned to that effect; and she beheld her brother in the act of\nwalking slowly across the yard with his back to her. He halted\nupon the border of her small garden of asters, regarded it\nanxiously, then spread his handkerchief upon the ground, knelt\nupon it, and with thoughtful care uprooted a few weeds which were\nbeginning to sprout, and also such vagrant blades of grass as\nencroached upon the floral territory. He had the air of a virtuous\nman performing a good action which would never become known.\nPlainly, he thought himself in solitude and all unobserved.\n\nIt was a touching picture, pious and humble. Done into coloured\nglass, the kneeling boy and the asters--submerged in ardent\nsunshine--would have appropriately enriched a cathedral: Boyhood\nof Saint Florus the Gardener.\n\nLaura heartlessly turned her back, and, affecting an interest in\nher sleeve, very soon experienced the sensation of being stared at\nwith some poignancy from behind. Unchanged in attitude, she\nunravelled an imaginary thread, whereupon the cough reached her\nagain, shrill and loud, its insistence not lacking in pathos.\n\nShe approached him, driftingly. No sign that he was aware came\nfrom the busied boy, though he coughed again, hollowly now--a\nproof that he was an artist. \"All right, Hedrick,\" she said\nkindly. \"I heard you the first time.\"\n\nHe looked up with utter incomprehension. \"I'm afraid I've caught\ncold,\" he said, simply. \"I got a good many weeds out before\nbreakfast, and the ground was damp.\"\n\nHedrick was of the New School: everything direct, real, no\nstriving for effect, no pressure on the stroke. He did his work:\nyou could take it or leave it.\n\n\"You mustn't strain so, dear,\" returned his sister, shaking her\nhead. \"It won't last if you do. You see this is only the first\nday.\"\n\nStruck to the heart by so brutal a misconception, he put all his\nwrongs into one look, rose in manly dignity, picked up his\nhandkerchief, and left her.\n\nHer eyes followed him, not without remorse: it was an exit which\nwould have moved the bass-violist of a theatre orchestra. Sighing,\nshe went to her own room by way of the kitchen and the\nback-stairs, and, having locked her door, brought the padlocked\nbook from its hiding-place.\n\n\"I think I should not have played as I did, an hour ago,\" she\nwrote. \"It stirs me too greatly and I am afraid it makes me\ninclined to self-pity afterward, and I must never let myself feel\n_that_! If I once begin to feel sorry for myself. . . . But I\n_will_ not! No. You are here in the world. You exist. You _are_!\nThat is the great thing to know and it must be enough for me. It\nis. I played to You. I played _just love_ to you--all the yearning\ntenderness--all the supreme kindness I want to give you. Isn't\nlove really just glorified kindness? No, there is something more.\n. . . I feel it, though I do not know how to say it. But it was in\nmy playing--I played it and played it. Suddenly I felt that in my\nplaying I had shouted it from the housetops, that I had told the\nsecret to all the world and _everybody_ knew. I stopped, and for a\nmoment it seemed to me that I was dying of shame. But no one\nunderstood. No one had even listened. . . . Sometimes it seems to\nme that I am like Cora, that I am very deeply her sister in some\nthings. My heart goes all to You--my revelation of it, my release\nof it, my outlet of it is all here in these pages (except when I\nplay as I did to-day and as I shall not play again) and perhaps\nthe writing keeps me quiet. Cora scatters her own releasings: she\nis looking for the You she may never find; and perhaps the penalty\nfor scattering is never finding. Sometimes I think the seeking has\nreacted and that now she seeks only what will make her feel. I\nhope she has not found it: I am afraid of this new man--not only\nfor your sake, dear. I felt repelled by his glance at me the first\ntime I saw him. I did not like it--I cannot say just why, unless\nthat it seemed too intimate. I am afraid of him for her, which is\na queer sort of feeling because she has alw----\"\n\nLaura's writing stopped there, for that day, interrupted by a\nhurried rapping upon the door and her mother's voice calling her\nwith stress and urgency.\n\nThe opening of the door revealed Mrs. Madison in a state of\nanxious perturbation, and admitted the sound of loud weeping and\nagitated voices from below.\n\n\"Please go down,\" implored the mother. \"You can do more with her\nthan I can. She and your father have been having a terrible scene\nsince Richard went home.\"\n\nLaura hurried down to the library.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\n\n\"Oh, _come_ in, Laura!\" cried her sister, as Laura appeared in the\ndoorway. \"Don't _stand_ there! Come in if you want to take part in\na grand old family row!\" With a furious and tear-stained face, she\nwas confronting her father who stood before her in a resolute\nattitude and a profuse perspiration. \"Shut the door!\" shouted Cora\nviolently, adding, as Laura obeyed, \"Do you want that little Pest\nin here? Probably he's eavesdropping anyway. But what difference\ndoes it make? I don't care. Let him hear! Let anybody hear that\nwants to! They can hear how I'm tortured if they like. I didn't\nclose my eyes last night, and now I'm being tortured. Papa!\" She\nstamped her foot. \"Are you going to take back that insult to me?\"\n\n\"`Insult'?\" repeated her father, in angry astonishment.\n\n\"Pshaw,\" said Laura, laughing soothingly and coming to her. \"You\nknow that's nonsense, Cora. Kind old papa couldn't do that if he\ntried. Dear, you know he never insulted anybody in his----\"\n\n\"Don't touch me!\" screamed Cora, repulsing her. \"Listen, if you've\ngot to, but let me alone. He did too! He did! He _knows_ what he\nsaid!\"\n\n\"I do not!\"\n\n\"He does! He does!\" cried Cora. \"He said that I was--I was too\nmuch `interested' in Mr. Corliss.\"\n\n\"Is that an `insult'?\" the father demanded sharply.\n\n\"It was the way he said it,\" Cora protested, sobbing. \"He meant\nsomething he didn't _say_. He did! He did! He _meant_ to insult\nme!\"\n\n\"I did nothing of the kind,\" shouted the old man.\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about. I said I couldn't\nunderstand your getting so excited about the fellow's affairs and\nthat you seemed to take a mighty sudden interest in him.\"\n\n\"Well, what if I _do_?\" she screamed. \"Haven't I a right to be\ninterested in what I choose? I've got to be interested in\n_something_, haven't I? _You_ don't make life very interesting, do\nyou? Do you think it's interesting to spend the summer in this\nhorrible old house with the paper falling off the walls and our\nrotten old furniture that I work my hands off trying to make look\ndecent and can't, and every other girl I know at the seashore with\nmotor-cars and motor-boats, or getting a trip abroad and buying\nher clothes in Paris? What do _you_ offer to interest me?\"\n\nThe unfortunate man hung his head. \"I don't see what all that has\nto do with it----\"\n\nShe seemed to leap at him. \"You _don't_? You _don't_?\"\n\n\"No, I don't. And I don't see why you're so crazy to please young\nCorliss about this business unless you're infatuated with him. I\nhad an idea--and I was pleased with it, too, because Richard's a\nsteady fellow--that you were just about engaged to Richard\nLindley, and----\"\n\n\"Engaged!\" she cried, repeating the word with bitter contempt.\n\"Engaged! You don't suppose I'll marry him unless I want to, do\nyou? I will if it suits me. I won't if it suits me not to;\nunderstand that! I don't consider myself engaged to anybody, and\nyou needn't either. What on earth has that got to do with your\nkeeping Richard Lindley from doing what Mr. Corliss wants him to?\"\n\n\"I'm not keeping him from anything. He didn't say----\"\n\n\"He did!\" stormed Cora. \"He said he would if you went into it. He\ntold me this afternoon, an hour ago.\"\n\n\"Now wait,\" said Madison. \"I talked this over with Richard two\ndays ago----\"\n\nCora stamped her foot again in frantic exasperation. \"I'm talking\nabout this afternoon!\"\n\n\"Two days ago,\" he repeated doggedly; \"and we came to the same\nconclusion: it won't do. He said he couldn't go into it unless he\nwent over there to Italy--and saw for himself just what he was\nputting his money into, and Corliss had told him that it couldn't\nbe done; that there wasn't time, and showed him a cablegram from\nhis Italian partner saying the secret had leaked out and that\nthey'd have to form the company in Naples and sell the stock over\nthere if it couldn't be done here within the next week. Corliss\nsaid he had to ask for an immediate answer, and so Richard told\nhim no, yesterday.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" groaned Cora. \"What has that got to do with _your_\ngoing into it? You're not going to risk any money! I don't ask you\nto _spend_ anything, do I? You haven't got it if I did. All Mr.\nCorliss wants is your name. Can't you give even _that_? What\nimportance is it?\"\n\n\"Well, if it isn't important, what difference does it make whether\nI give it or not?\"\n\nShe flung up her arms as in despairing appeal for patience. \"It\n_is_ important to him! Richard will do it if you will be secretary\nof the company: he promised me. Mr. Corliss told me your name was\nworth everything here: that men said downtown you could have been\nrich long ago if you hadn't been so square. Richard trusts you; he\nsays you're the most trusted man in town----\"\n\n\"That's why I can't do it,\" he interrupted.\n\n\"No!\" Her vehemence increased suddenly to its utmost. \"No! Don't\nyou say that, because it's a lie. That isn't the reason you won't\ndo it. You won't do it because you think it would please _me_!\nYou're afraid it might make me _happy_! Happy--happy--_happy_!\"\nShe beat her breast and cast herself headlong upon the sofa,\nsobbing wildly. \"Don't come near me!\" she screamed at Laura, and\nsprang to her feet again, dishevelled and frantic. \"Oh, Christ in\nheaven! is there such a thing as happiness in this beast of a\nworld? I want to leave it. I want to go away: I want _so_ to die:\nWhy can't I? Why can't I! Why can't I! Oh, God, why _can't_ I die?\nWhy can't----\"\n\nHer passion culminated in a shriek: she gasped, was convulsed from\nhead to foot for a dreadful moment, tore at the bosom of her dress\nwith rigid bent fingers, swayed; then collapsed all at once. Laura\ncaught her, and got her upon the sofa. In the hall, Mrs. Madison\ncould be heard running and screaming to Hedrick to go for the\ndoctor. Next instant, she burst into the room with brandy and\ncamphor.\n\n\"I could only find these; the ammonia bottle's empty,\" she panted;\nand the miserable father started hatless, for the drug-store, a\nfaint, choked wail from the stricken girl sounding in his ears:\n\"It's--it's my heart, mamma.\"\n\nIt was four blocks to the nearest pharmacy; he made what haste he\ncould in the great heat, but to himself he seemed double his usual\nweight; and the more he tried to hurry, the less speed appeared\nobtainable from his heavy legs. When he reached the place at last,\nhe found it crowded with noisy customers about the \"soda-fount\";\nand the clerks were stonily slow: they seemed to know that they\nwere \"already in eternity.\" He got very short of breath on the way\nhome; he ceased to perspire and became unnaturally dry; the air\nwas aflame and the sun shot fire upon his bare head. His feet\ninclined to strange disobediences: he walked the last block\nwaveringly. A solemn Hedrick met him at the door.\n\n\"They've got her to bed,\" announced the boy. \"The doctor's up\nthere.\"\n\n\"Take this ammonia up,\" said Madison huskily, and sat down upon a\nlower step of the stairway with a jolt, closing his eyes.\n\n\"You sick, too?\" asked Hedrick.\n\n\"No. Run along with that ammonia.\"\n\nIt seemed to Madison a long time that he sat there alone, and he\nfelt very dizzy. Once he tried to rise, but had to give it up and\nremain sitting with his eyes shut. At last he heard Cora's door\nopen and close; and his wife and the doctor came slowly down the\nstairs, Mrs. Madison talking in the anxious yet relieved voice of\none who leaves a sick-room wherein the physician pronounces\nprogress encouraging.\n\n\"And you're _sure_ her heart trouble isn't organic?\" she asked.\n\n\"Her heart is all right,\" her companion assured her. \"There's\nnothing serious; the trouble is nervous. I think you'll find\nshe'll be better after a good sleep. Just keep her quiet. Hadn't\nshe been in a state of considerable excitement?\"\n\n\"Ye-es--she----\"\n\n\"Ah! A little upset on account of opposition to a plan she'd\nformed, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Well--partly,\" assented the mother.\n\n\"I see,\" he returned, adding with some dryness: \"I thought it just\npossible.\"\n\nMadison got to his feet, and stepped down from the stairs for them\nto pass him. He leaned heavily against the wall.\n\n\"You think she's going to be all right, Sloane?\" he asked with an\neffort.\n\n\"No cause to worry,\" returned the physician. \"You can let her stay\nin bed to-day if she wants to but----\" He broke off, looking\nkeenly at Madison's face, which was the colour of poppies. \"Hello!\nwhat's up with _you_?\"\n\n\"I'm all--right.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are?\" retorted Sloane with sarcasm. \"Sit down,\" he\ncommanded. \"Sit right where you are--on the stairs, here,\" and,\nhaving enforced the order, took a stethoscope from his pocket.\n\"Get him a glass of water,\" he said to Hedrick, who was at his\nelbow.\n\n\"Doctor!\" exclaimed Mrs. Madison. \"_He_ isn't going to be sick, is\nhe? You don't think he's sick _now_?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't call him very well,\" answered the physician rather\ngrimly, placing his stethoscope upon Madison's breast. \"Get his\nroom ready for him.\" She gave him a piteous look, struck with\nfear; then obeyed a gesture and ran flutteringly up the stairs.\n\n\"I'm all right now,\" panted Madison, drinking the water Hedrick\nbrought him.\n\n\"You're not so darned all right,\" said Sloane coolly, as he\npocketed his stethoscope. \"Come, let me help you up. We're going\nto get you to bed.\"\n\nThere was an effort at protest, but the physician had his way, and\nthe two ascended the stairs slowly, Sloane's arm round his new\npatient. At Cora's door, the latter paused.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I want,\" said Madison thickly--\"I want--to speak to Cora.\"\n\n\"We'll pass that up just now,\" returned the other brusquely, and\nled him on. Madison was almost helpless: he murmured in a husky,\nuncertain voice, and suffered himself to be put to bed. There, the\ndoctor \"worked\" with him; cold \"applications\" were ordered; Laura\nwas summoned from the other sick-bed; Hedrick sent flying with\nprescriptions, then to telephone for a nurse. The two women\nattempted questions at intervals, but Sloane replied with orders,\nand kept them busy.\n\n\"Do you--think I'm a---a pretty sick man, Sloane?\" asked Madison\nafter a long silence, speaking with difficulty.\n\n\"Oh, you're sick, all right,\" the doctor conceded.\n\n\"I--I want to speak to Jennie.\"\n\nHis wife rushed to the bed, and knelt beside it.\n\n\"Don't you go to confessing your sins,\" said Doctor Sloane\ncrossly. \"You're coming out of the woods all right, and you'll be\nsorry if you tell her too, much. I'll begin a little flirtation\nwith you, Miss Laura, if you please.\" And he motioned to her to\nfollow him into the hall.\n\n\"Your father _is_ pretty sick,\" he told her, \"and he may be sicker\nbefore we get him into shape again. But you needn't be worried\nright now; I think he's not in immediate danger.\" He turned at the\nsound of Mrs. Madison's step, behind him, and repeated to her what\nhe had just said to Laura. \"I hope your husband didn't give\nhimself away enough to be punished when we get him on his feet\nagain,\" he concluded cheerfully.\n\nShe shook her head, tried to smile through tears, and, crossing\nthe hall, entered Cora's room. She came back after a moment, and,\nrejoining the other two at her husband's bedside, found the sick\nman in a stertorous sleep. Presently the nurse arrived, and upon\nthe physician's pointed intimation that there were \"too many\npeople around,\" Laura went to Cora's room. She halted on the\nthreshold in surprise. Cora was dressing.\n\n\"Mamma says the doctor says he's all right,\" said Cora lightly,\n\"and I'm feeling so much better myself I thought I'd put on\nsomething loose and go downstairs. I think there's more air down\nthere.\"\n\n\"Papa isn't all right, dear,\" said Laura, staring perplexedly at\nCora's idea of \"something loose,\" an equipment inclusive of\nsomething particularly close. \"The doctor says he is very sick.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" returned Cora promptly. \"Old Sloane never\ndid know anything. Besides, mamma told me he said papa isn't in\nany danger.\"\n\n\"No `immediate' danger,\" corrected Laura. \"And besides, Doctor\nSloane said you were to stay in bed until to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I can't help that.\" Cora went on with her lacing impatiently.\n\"I'm not going to lie and stifle in this heat when I feel\nperfectly well again--not for an old idiot like Sloane! He didn't\neven have sense enough to give me any medicine.\" She laughed.\n\"Lucky thing he didn't: I'd have thrown it out of the window. Kick\nthat slipper to me, will you, dear?\"\n\nLaura knelt and put the slipper on her sister's foot. \"Cora,\ndear,\" she said, \"you're just going to put on a negligee and go\ndown and sit in the library, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Laura!\" The tone was more than impatient. \"I wish I could be let\nalone for five whole minutes some time in my life! Don't you think\nI've stood enough for one day? I can't bear to be questioned,\nquestioned, questioned! What do you do it for? Don't you see I\ncan't stand anything more? If you can't let me alone I do wish\nyou'd keep out of my room.\"\n\nLaura rose and went out; but as she left the door, Cora called\nafter her with a rueful laugh: \"Laura, I know I'm a little devil!\"\n\nHalf an hour later, Laura, suffering because she had made no reply\nto this peace-offering, and wishing to atone, sought Cora\ndownstairs and found no one. She decided that Cora must still be\nin her own room; she would go to her there. But as she passed the\nopen front door, she saw Cora upon the sidewalk in front of the\nhouse. She wore a new and elaborate motoring costume, charmingly\nbecoming, and was in the act of mounting to a seat beside\nValentine Corliss in a long, powerful-looking, white \"roadster\"\nautomobile. The engine burst into staccato thunder, sobered down;\nthe wheels began to move both Cora and Corliss were laughing and\nthere was an air of triumph about them--Cora's veil streamed and\nfluttered: and in a flash they were gone.\n\nLaura stared at the suddenly vacated space where they had been. At\na thought she started. Then she rushed upstairs to her mother, who\nwas sitting in the hall near her husband's door.\n\n\"Mamma,\" whispered Laura, flinging herself upon her knees beside\nher, \"when papa wanted to speak to you, was it a message to Cora?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear. He told me to tell her he was sorry he'd made her\nsick, and that if he got well he'd try to do what she asked him\nto.\"\n\nLaura nodded cheerfully. \"And he _will_ get well, darling mother,\"\nshe said, as she rose. \"I'll come back in a minute and sit with\nyou.\"\n\nHer return was not so quick as she promised, for she lay a long\ntime weeping upon her pillow, whispering over and over:\n\n\"Oh, poor, poor papa! Oh, poor, poor Richard!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE\n\nWithin a week Mr. Madison's illness was a settled institution in\nthe household; the presence of the nurse lost novelty, even to\nHedrick, and became a part of life; the day was measured by the\nthree regular visits of the doctor. To the younger members of the\nfamily it seemed already that their father had always been sick,\nand that he always would be; indeed, to Cora and Hedrick he had\nbecome only a weak and querulous voice beyond a closed door.\nDoctor Sloane was serious but reassuring, his daily announcement\nbeing that his patient was in \"no immediate danger.\"\n\nMrs. Madison did not share her children's sanguine adaptability;\nand, of the three, Cora was the greatest solace to the mother's\ntroubled heart, though Mrs. Madison never recognized this without\na sense of injustice to Laura, for Laura now was housewife and\nhousekeeper--that is, she did all the work except the cooking, and\non \"wash-day\" she did that. But Cora's help was to the very spirit\nitself, for she was sprightly in these hours of trial: with\nindomitable gayety she cheered her mother, inspiring in her a\nfirmer confidence, and, most stimulating of all, Cora steadfastly\nrefused to consider her father's condition as serious, or its\noutcome as doubtful.\n\nOld Sloane exaggerated, she said; and she made fun of his gravity,\nhis clothes and his walk, which she mimicked till she drew a\nreluctant and protesting laugh from even her mother. Mrs. Madison\nwas sure she \"couldn't get through\" this experience save for Cora,\nwho was indeed the light of the threatened house.\n\nStrange perversities of this world: Cora's gayety was almost\nunbearable to her brother. Not because he thought it either\nunfeeling or out of place under the circumstances (an aspect he\nfailed to consider), but because years of warfare had so\nfrequently made him connect cheerfulness on her part with some\nunworthily won triumph over himself that habit prevailed, and he\ncould not be a witness of her high spirits without a strong sense\nof injury. Additionally, he was subject to a deeply implanted\nsuspicion of any appearance of unusual happiness in her as having\nsource, if not in his own defeat, then in something vaguely \"soft\"\nand wholly distasteful. She grated upon him; he chafed, and his\nsufferings reached the surface. Finally, in a reckless moment, one\nevening at dinner, he broke out with a shout and hurled a newly\ndevised couplet concerning luv-a-ly slush at his, sister's head.\nThe nurse was present: Cora left the table; and Hedrick later\nreceived a serious warning from Laura. She suggested that it might\nbecome expedient to place him in Cora's power.\n\n\"Cora knows perfectly well that something peculiar happened to\nyou,\" she advised him. \"And she knows that I know what it was; and\nshe says it isn't very sisterly of me not to tell her. Now,\nHedrick, there was no secret about it; you didn't _confide_\nyour--your trouble to me, and it would be perfectly honourable of\nme to tell it. I wont{sic} unless you make me, but if you can't be\npolite and keep peace with Cora--at least while papa is sick I\nthink it may be necessary. I believe,\" she finished with imperfect\ngravity, \"that it--it would keep things quieter.\"\n\nThe thoughts of a boy may be long, long thoughts, but he cannot\npersistently remember to fear a threatened catastrophe. Youth is\ntoo quickly intimate with peril. Hedrick had become familiar with\nhis own, had grown so accustomed to it he was in danger of\nforgetting it altogether; therefore it was out of perspective. The\nepisode of Lolita had begun to appear as a thing of the distant\nand clouded past: time is so long at thirteen. Added to this, his\nlate immaculate deportment had been, as Laura suggested, a severe\nstrain; the machinery of his nature was out of adjustment and\ndemanded a violent reaction before it could get to running again\nat average speed. Also, it is evident that his destruction had\nbeen planned on high, for he was mad enough to answer flippantly:\n\n\"Tell her! Go on and tell her--_I_ give you leaf! _that_ wasn't\nanything anyway--just helped you get a little idiot girl home.\nWhat is there to that? I never saw her before; never saw her\nagain; didn't have half as much to do with her as you did\nyourself. She was a lot more _your_ friend than mine; I didn't\neven know her. I guess you'll have to get something better on me\nthan that, before you try to boss _this_ ranch, Laura Madison!\"\n\nThat night, in bed, he wondered if he had not been perhaps a\ntrifle rash; but the day was bright when he awoke, and no\napprehension shadowed his morning face as he appeared at the\nbreakfast table. On the contrary, a great weight had lifted from\nhim; clearly his defiance had been the proper thing; he had shown\nLaura that her power over him was but imaginary. Hypnotized by his\nown words to her, he believed them; and his previous terrors\nbecame gossamer; nay, they were now merely laughable. His own\nremorse and shame were wholly blotted from memory, and he could\nnot understand why in the world he had been so afraid, nor why he\nhad felt it so necessary to placate Laura. She looked very meek\nthis morning. _That_ showed! The strong hand was the right policy\nin dealing with women. He was tempted to insane daring: the rash,\nunfortunate child waltzed on the lip of the crater.\n\n\"Told Cora yet?\" he asked, with scornful laughter.\n\n\"Told me what?\" Cora looked quickly up from her plate.\n\n\"Oh, nothing about this Corliss,\" he returned scathingly. \"Don't\nget excited.\"\n\n\"Hedrick!\" remonstrated his mother, out of habit.\n\n\"She never thinks of anything else these days,\" he retorted.\n\"Rides with him every evening in his pe-rin-sley hired machine,\ndoesn't she?\"\n\n\"Really, you should be more careful about the way you handle a\nspoon, Hedrick,\" said Cora languidly, and with at least a\nfoundation of fact. \"It is not the proper implement for decorating\nthe cheeks. We all need nourishment, but it is _so_ difficult\nwhen one sees a deposit of breakfast-food in the ear of one's\nvis-a-vis.\"\n\nHedrick too impulsively felt of his ears and was but the worse\nstung to find them immaculate and the latter half of the\nindictment unjustified.\n\n\"Spoon!\" he cried. \"I wouldn't talk about spoons if I were you,\nCora-lee! After what I saw in the library the other night, believe\n_me_, you're the one of this family that better be careful how you\n`handle a spoon'!\"\n\nCora had a moment of panic. She let the cup she was lifting drop\nnoisily upon its saucer, and gazed whitely at the boy, her mouth\nopening wide.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" he went on, with a dreadful laugh. \"I didn't hear you\nasking this Corliss to kiss you! Oh, no!\"\n\nAt this, though her mother and Laura both started, a faint, odd\nrelief showed itself in Cora's expression. She recovered herself.\n\n\"You little liar!\" she flashed, and, with a single quick look at\nher mother, as of one too proud to appeal, left the room.\n\n\"Hedrick, Hedrick, Hedrick!\" wailed Mrs. Madison. \"And she told me\nyou drove her from the table last night too, right before Miss\nPeirce!\" Miss Peirce was the nurse, fortunately at this moment in\nthe sick-room.\n\n\"I _did_ hear her ask him that,\" he insisted, sullenly. \"Don't you\nbelieve it?\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\"\n\nBurning with outrage, he also left his meal unfinished and\ndeparted in high dignity. He passed through the kitchen, however,\non his way out of the house; but, finding an unusual politeness to\nthe cook nothing except its own reward, went on his way with a\nbitter perception of the emptiness of the world and other places.\n\n\"Your father managed to talk more last night,\" said Mrs. Madison\npathetically to Laura. \"He made me understand that he was fretting\nabout how little we'd been able to give our children; so few\nadvantages; it's always troubled him terribly. But sometimes I\nwonder if we've done right: we've neither of us ever exercised any\ndiscipline. We just couldn't bear to. You see, not having any\nmoney, or the things money could buy, to give, I think we've\ninstinctively tried to make up for it by indulgence in other ways,\nand perhaps it's been a bad thing. Not,\" she added hastily, \"not\nthat you aren't all three the best children any mother and father\never had! _He_ said so. He said the only trouble was that our\nchildren were too good for us.\" She shook her head remorsefully\nthroughout Laura's natural reply to this; was silent a while;\nthen, as she rose, she said timidly, not looking at her daughter:\n\"Of course Hedrick didn't mean to tell an outright lie. They were\njust talking, and perhaps he--perhaps he heard something that made\nhim think what he _did_. People are so often mistaken in what they\nhear, even when they're talking right to each other, and----\"\n\n\"Isn't it more likely,\" said Laura, gravely, \"that Cora was\ntelling some story or incident, and that Hedrick overheard that\npart of it, and thought she was speaking directly to Mr. Corliss?\"\n\n\"Of course!\" cried the mother with instant and buoyant relief; and\nwhen the three ladies convened, a little later, Cora\n(unquestioned) not only confirmed this explanation, but repeated\nin detail the story she had related to Mr. Corliss. Laura had been\nquick.\n\nHedrick passed a variegated morning among comrades. He obtained\nprestige as having a father like-to-die, but another boy turned up\nwho had learned to chew tobacco. Then Hedrick was pronounced\ninferior to others in turning \"cartwheels,\" but succeeded in a\nwrestling match for an apple, which he needed. Later, he was\nchased empty-handed from the rear of an ice-wagon, but greatly\nadmired for his retorts to the vociferous chaser: the other boys\nrightly considered that what he said to the ice-man was much more\nhorrible than what the ice-man said to him. The ice-man had a fair\nvocabulary, but it lacked pliancy; seemed stiff and fastidious\ncompared with the flexible Saxon in which Hedrick sketched a\nfamily tree lacking, perhaps, some plausibility as having produced\neven an ice-man, but curiously interesting zoologically.\n\nHe came home at noon with the flush of this victory new upon his\nbrow. He felt equal to anything, and upon Cora's appearing at\nlunch with a blithe, bright air and a new arrangement of her hair,\nhe opened a fresh campaign with ill-omened bravado.\n\n\"Ear-muffs in style for September, are they?\" he inquired in\nallusion to a symmetrical and becoming undulation upon each side\nof her head. \"Too bad Ray Vilas can't come any more; he'd like\nthose, I know he would.\"\n\nCora, who was talking jauntily to her mother, went on without\nheeding. She affected her enunciation at times with a slight lisp;\nspoke preciously and over-exquisitely, purposely mincing the\nletter R, at the same time assuming a manner of artificial\ndistinction and conscious elegance which never failed to produce\nin her brother the last stage of exasperation. She did this now.\nCharming woman, that dear Mrs. Villard, she prattled. \"I met her\ndowntown this morning. Dear mamma, you should but have seen her\ndelight when she saw _me_. She was but just returned from Bar\nHarbor----\"\n\n\"`Baw-hawbaw'!\" Poor Hedrick was successfully infuriated\nimmediately. \"What in thunder is `Baw-hawbaw'? Mrs. Villawd!\nBaw-hawbaw! Oh, maw!\"\n\n\"She had no idea she should find _me_ in town, she said,\" Cora ran\non, happily. \"She came back early on account of the children\nhaving to be sent to school. She has such adorable\nchildren--beautiful, dimpled babes----\"\n\n\"SLUSH! SLUSH! LUV-A-LY SLUSH!\"\n\n\"--And her dear son, Egerton Villard, he's grown to be such a\ncomely lad, and he has the most charming courtly manners: he\nhelped his mother out of her carriage with all the air of a man of\nthe world, and bowed to me as to a duchess. I think he might be a\ngreat influence for good if the dear Villards would but sometimes\nlet him associate a little with our unfortunate Hedrick. Egerton\nVillard is really _distingue_; he has a beautiful head; and if he\ncould be induced but to let Hedrick follow him about but a\nlittle----\"\n\n\"I'll beat his beautiful head off for him if he but butts in on me\nbut a little!\" Hedrick promised earnestly. \"Idiot!\"\n\nCora turned toward him innocently. \"What did you say, Hedrick?\"\n\n\"I said `Idiot'!\"\n\n\"You mean Egerton Villard?\"\n\n\"Both of you!\"\n\n\"You think I'm an idiot, Hedrick?\" Her tone was calm, merely\ninquisitive.\n\n\"Yes, I do!\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she said pleasantly. \"Don't you think if I were _really_\nan idiot I'd be even fonder of you than I am?\"\n\nIt took his breath. In a panic he sat waiting he knew not what;\nbut Cora blandly resumed her interrupted remarks to her mother,\nbeginning a description of Mrs. Villard's dress; Laura was talking\nunconcernedly to Miss Peirce; no one appeared to be aware that\nanything unusual had been said. His breath came back, and,\nsummoning his presence of mind, he found himself able to consider\nhis position with some degree of assurance. Perhaps, after all,\nCora's retort had been merely a coincidence. He went over and over\nit in his mind, making a pretence, meanwhile, to be busy with his\nplate. \"If I were _really_ an idiot.\" . . . It was the \"_really_\"\nthat troubled him. But for that one word, he could have decided\nthat her remark was a coincidence; but \"_really_\" was ominous; had\na sinister ring. \"If I were _really_ an idiot!\" Suddenly the\npleasant clouds that had obscured his memory of the fatal evening\nwere swept away as by a monstrous Hand: it all came back to him\nwith sickening clearness. So is it always with the sinner with his\nsin and its threatened discovery. Again, in his miserable mind, he\nsat beside Lolita on the fence, with the moon shining through her\nhair; and he knew--for he had often read it--that a man could be\npunished his whole life through for a single moment's weakness. A\nman might become rich, great, honoured, and have a large family,\nbut his one soft sin would follow him, hunt him out and pull him\ndown at last. \"_Really_ an idiot!\" Did that relentless Comanche,\nCora, know this Thing? He shuddered. Then he fell back upon his\nfaith in Providence. It _could_ not be that she knew! Ah, no!\nHeaven would not let the world be so bad as that! And yet it did\nsometimes become negligent--he remembered the case of a baby-girl\ncousin who fell into the bath-tub and was drowned. Providence had\nallowed that: What assurance had he that it would not go a step\nfarther?\n\n\"Why, Hedrick,\" said Cora, turning toward him cheerfully, \"you're\nnot really eating anything; you're only pretending to.\" His heart\nsank with apprehension. Was it coming? \"You really must eat,\" she\nwent on. \"School begins so soon, you must be strong, you know. How\nwe shall miss you here at home during your hours of work!\"\n\nWith that, the burden fell from his shoulders, his increasing\nterrors took wing. If Laura had told his ghastly secret to Cora,\nthe latter would not have had recourse to such weak satire as\nthis. Cora was not the kind of person to try a popgun on an enemy\nwhen she had a thirteen-inch gun at her disposal; so he reasoned;\nand in the gush of his relief and happiness, responded:\n\n\"You're a little too cocky lately, Cora-lee: I wish you were _my_\ndaughter--just about five minutes!\"\n\nCora looked upon him fondly. \"What would you do to me,\" she\ninquired with a terrible sweetness--\"darling little boy?\"\n\nHedrick's head swam. The blow was square in the face; it jarred\nevery bone; the world seemed to topple. His mother, rising from\nher chair, choked slightly, and hurried to join the nurse, who was\nalready on her way upstairs. Cora sent an affectionate laugh\nacross the table to her stunned antagonist.\n\n\"You wouldn't beat me, would you, dear?\" she murmured. \"I'm almost\nsure you wouldn't; not if I asked you to kiss me some _more_.\"\n\nAll doubt was gone, the last hope fled! The worst had arrived. A\nvision of the awful future flamed across his staggered mind. The\ndoors to the arena were flung open: the wild beasts howled for\nhunger of him; the spectators waited.\n\nCora began lightly to sing:\n\n      . . . \"Dear,\n    Would thou wert near\n    To hear me tell how fair thou art!\n    Since thou art gone I mourn all alone,\n    Oh, my Lolita----\"\n\nShe broke off to explain: \"It's one of those passionate little\nSpanish serenades, Hedrick. I'll sing it for your boy-friends next\ntime they come to play in the yard. I think they'd like it. When\nthey know why you like it so much, I'm sure they will. Of course\nyou _do_ like it--you roguish little lover!\" A spasm rewarded this\ndemoniacal phrase. \"Darling little boy, the serenade goes on like\nthis:\n\n    Oh, my Lolita, come to my heart:\n    Oh, come beloved, love let me press thee,\n    While I caress thee\n    In one long kiss, Lolita!\n    Lolita come! Let me----\"\n\nHedrick sprang to his feet with a yell of agony. \"Laura Madison,\nyou tattle-tale,\" he bellowed, \"I'll never forgive you as long as\nI live! I'll get even with you if it takes a thousand years!\"\n\nWith that, and pausing merely to kick a rung out of a chair which\nhappened to be in his way, he rushed from the room.\n\nHis sisters had risen to go, and Cora flung her arms round Laura\nin ecstacy. \"You mean old viper!\" she cried. \"You could have told\nme days ago! It's almost too good to be true: it's the first time\nin my whole life I've felt safe from the Pest for a moment!\"\n\nLaura shook her head. \"My conscience troubles me; it did seem as\nif I ought to tell you--and mamma thought so, too; and I gave him\nwarning, but now that I have done it, it seems rather mean\nand----\"\n\n\"No!\" exclaimed Cora. \"You just gave me a chance to protect myself\nfor once, thank heaven!\" And she picked up her skirts and danced\nher way into the front hall.\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" said Laura, following, \"I shouldn't have done it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Laura,\" cried the younger girl, \"I am having the best time,\nthese days! This just caps it.\" She lowered her voice, but her\neyes grew even brighter. \"I think I've shown a certain gentleman a\nfew things he didn't understand!\"\n\n\"Who, dear?\"\n\n\"Val,\" returned Cora lightly; \"Valentine Corliss. I think he knows\na little more about women than he did when he first came here.\"\n\n\"You've had a difference with him?\" asked Laura with eager\nhopefulness. \"You've broken with him?\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord, no! Nothing like that.\" Cora leaned to her\nconfidentially. \"He told me, once, he'd be at the feet of any\nwoman that could help put through an affair like his oil scheme,\nand I decided I'd just show him what I could do. He'd talk about\nit to me; then he'd laugh at me. That very Sunday when I got papa\nto go in----\"\n\n\"But he didn't,\" said Laura helplessly. \"He only said he'd try\nto----when he gets well.\"\n\n\"It's all the same--and it'll be a great thing for him, too,\" said\nCora, gayly. \"Well, that very afternoon before Val left, he\npractically told me I was no good. Of course he didn't use just\nthose words--that isn't his way--but he laughed at me. And haven't\nI shown him! I sent Richard a note that very night saying papa had\nconsented to be secretary of the company, and Richard had said\nhe'd go in if papa did that, and he couldn't break his word----\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Laura, sighing. \"I know.\"\n\n\"Laura\"--Cora spoke with sudden gravity--\"did you ever know\nanybody like me? I'm almost getting superstitious about it,\nbecause it seems to me I _always_ get just what I set out to get.\nI believe I could have anything in the world if I tried for it.\"\n\n\"I hope so, if you tried for something good for you,\" said Laura\nsadly. \"Cora, dear, you will--you will be a little easy on\nHedrick, won't you?\"\n\nCora leaned against the newel and laughed till she was exhausted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\n\nMr. Trumble's offices were heralded by a neat blazon upon the\nprincipal door, \"Wade J. Trumble, Mortgages and Loans\"; and the\ngentleman thus comfortably, proclaimed, emerging from that door\nupon a September noontide, burlesqued a start of surprise at sight\nof a figure unlocking an opposite door which exhibited the name,\n\"Ray Vilas,\" and below it, the cryptic phrase, \"Probate Law.\"\n\n\"Water!\" murmured Mr. Trumble, affecting to faint. \"You ain't\ngoing in _there_, are you, Ray?\" He followed the other into the\noffice, and stood leaning against a bookcase, with his hands in\nhis pockets, while Vilas raised the two windows, which were\nobscured by a film of smoke-deposit: there was a thin coat of fine\nsifted dust over everything. \"Better not sit down, Ray,\" continued\nTrumble, warningly. \"You'll spoil your clothes and you might get a\nclient. That word `Probate' on the door ain't going to keep 'em\nout forever. You recognize the old place, I s'pose? You must have\nbeen here at least twice since you moved in. What's the matter?\nDick Lindley hasn't missionaried you into any idea of _working_,\nhas he? Oh, no, _I_ see: the Richfield Hotel bar has\nclosed--you've managed to drink it all at last!\"\n\n\"Have you heard how old man Madison is to-day?\" asked Ray, dusting\nhis fingers with a handkerchief.\n\n\"Somebody told me yesterday he was about the same. He's not going\nto get well.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" Ray spoke quickly.\n\n\"Stroke too severe. People never recover----\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, they do, too.\"\n\nTrumble began hotly: \"I beg to dif----\" but checked himself,\nmanifesting a slight confusion. \"That is, I know they don't. Old\nMadison may live a while, if you call that getting well; but he'll\nnever be the same man he was. Doctor Sloane says it was a bad\nstroke. Says it was `induced by heat prostration and excitement.'\n`Excitement!'\" he repeated with a sour laugh. \"Yep, I expect a man\ncould get all the excitement he wanted in _that_ house, especially\nif he was her daddy. Poor old man, I don't believe he's got five\nthousand dollars in the world, and look how she dresses!\"\n\nRay opened a compartment beneath one of the bookcases, and found a\nbottle and some glasses. \"Aha,\" he muttered, \"our janitor doesn't\ndrink, I perceive. Join me?\" Mr. Trumble accepted, and Ray\nexplained, cheerfully: \"Richard Lindley's got me so cowed I'm\nafraid to go near any of my old joints. You see, he trails me; the\nscoundrel has kept me sober for whole days at a time, and I've\nbeen mortified, having old friends see me in that condition; so I\nhave to sneak up here to my own office to drink to Cora, now and\nthen. You mustn't tell him. What's she been doing to _you_,\nlately?\"\n\nThe little man addressed grew red with the sharp, resentful\nmemory. \"Oh, nothing! Just struck me in the face with her parasol\non the public street, that's all!\" He gave an account of his walk\nto church with Cora. \"I'm through with that girl!\" he exclaimed\nvindictively, in conclusion. \"It was the damnedest thing you ever\nsaw in your life: right in broad daylight, in front of the church.\nAnd she laughed when she did it; you'd have thought she was\nknocking a puppy out of her way. She can't do that to me twice, I\ntell you. What the devil do you see to laugh at?\"\n\n\"You'll be around,\" returned his companion, refilling the glasses,\n\"asking for more, the first chance she gives you. Here's her\nhealth!\"\n\n\"I don't drink it!\" cried Mr. Trumble angrily.\n\n\"And I'm through with her for good, I tell you! I'm not your kind:\nI don't let a girl like that upset me till I can't think of\nanything else, and go making such an ass of myself that the whole\ntown gabbles about it. Cora Madison's seen the last of me, I'll\nthank you to notice. She's never been half-decent to me; cut\ndances with me all last winter; kept me hanging round the\noutskirts of every crowd she was in; stuck me with Laura and her\nmother every time she had a chance; then has the nerve to try to\nuse me, so's she can make a bigger hit with a new man! You can bet\nyour head I'm through! She'll get paid though! Oh, she'll get paid\nfor it!\"\n\n\"How?\" laughed Ray.\n\nIt was a difficult question. \"You wait and see,\" responded the\nthreatener, feebly. \"Just wait and see. She's wild about this\nCorliss, I tell you,\" he continued, with renewed vehemence. \"She's\ncrazy about him; she's lost her head at last----\"\n\n\"You mean he's going to avenge you?\"\n\n\"No, I don't, though he might, if she decided to marry him.\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Ray slowly, glancing over his glass at his\nnervous companion, \"it doesn't strike me that Mr. Valentine\nCorliss has much the air of a marrying man.\"\n\n\"He has the air to _me_,\" observed Mr. Trumble, \"of a darned bad\nlot! But I have to hand it to him: he's a wizard. He's got\nsomething besides his good looks--a man that could get Cora\nMadison interested in `business'! In _oil_! Cora Madison! How do\nyou suppose----\"\n\nHis companion began to laugh again. \"You don't really suppose he\ntalked his oil business to her, do you, Trumble?\"\n\n\"He must have. Else how could she----\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Cora herself never talks upon any subject but one; she\nnever listens to any other either.\"\n\n\"Then how in thunder did he----\"\n\n\"If Cora asks you if you think it will rain,\" interrupted Vilas,\n\"doesn't she really seem to be asking: `Do you love me? How much?'\nSuppose Mr. Corliss is an expert in the same line. Of course he\ncan talk about oil!\"\n\n\"He strikes me,\" said Trumble, \"as just about the slickest\ncustomer that ever hit this town. I like Richard Lindley, and I\nhope he'll see his fifty thousand dollars again. _I_ wouldn't have\ngiven Corliss thirty cents.\"\n\n\"Why do you think he's a crook?\"\n\n\"I don't say that,\" returned Trumble. \"All _I_ know about him is\nthat he's done some of the finest work to get fifty thousand\ndollars put in his hands that I ever heard of. And all anybody\nknows about him is that he lived here seventeen years ago, and\ncomes back claiming to know where there's oil in Italy. He shows\nsome maps and papers and gets cablegrams signed `Moliterno.' Then\nhe talks about selling the old Corliss house here, where the\nMadisons live, and putting the money into his oil company: he does\nthat to sound plausible, but I have good reason to know that house\nwas mortgaged to its full value within a month after his aunt left\nit to him. He'll not get a cent if it's sold. That's all. And he's\ngot Cora Madison so crazy over him that she makes life a hell for\npoor old Lindley until he puts all he's saved into the bubble. The\nscheme may be all right. How do _I_ know? There's no way to tell,\nwithout going over there, and Corliss won't let anybody do\nthat--oh, he's got a plausible excuse for it! But I'm sorry for\nLindley: he's so crazy about Cora, he's soft. And she's so crazy\nabout Corliss _she's_ soft! Well, I used to be crazy about her\nmyself, but I'm not soft--I'm not the Lindley kind of loon, thank\nheaven!\"\n\n\"What kind are you, Trumble?\" asked Ray, mildly.\n\n\"Not your kind either,\" retorted the other going to the door. \"She\ncut me on the street the other day; she's quit speaking to me. If\nyou've got any money, why don't you take it over to the hotel and\ngive it to Corliss? She might start speaking to _you_ again. I'm\ngoing to lunch!\" He slammed the door behind him.\n\nRay Vilas, left alone, elevated his heels to the sill, and stared\nout of the window a long time at a gravelled roof which presented\nlittle of interest. He replenished his glass and his imagination\nfrequently, the latter being so stirred that when, about three\no'clock, he noticed the inroads he had made upon the bottle, tears\nof self-pity came to his eyes. \"Poor little drunkard!\" he said\naloud. \"Go ahead and do it. Isn't anything _you_ won't do!\" And,\nhaving washed his face at a basin in a corner, he set his hat\nslightly upon one side, picked up a walking stick and departed\njauntily, and, to the outward eye, presentably sober.\n\nMr. Valentine Corliss would be glad to see him, the clerk at the\nRichfield Hotel reported, after sending up a card, and upon Ray's\nfollowing the card, Mr. Valentine Corliss in person confirmed the\nmessage with considerable amusement and a cordiality in which\nthere was some mixture of the quizzical. He was the taller; and\nthe robust manliness of his appearance, his splendid health and\nboxer's figure offered a sharp contrast to the superlatively lean\ntippler. Corliss was humorously aware of his advantage: his\ngreeting seemed really to say, \"Hello, my funny bug, here you are\nagain!\" though the words of his salutation were entirely\ncourteous; and he followed it with a hospitable offer.\n\n\"No,\" said Vilas; \"I won't drink with you.\" He spoke so gently\nthat the form of his refusal, usually interpreted as truculent,\nescaped the other's notice. He also declined a cigar,\napologetically asking permission to light one of his own\ncigarettes; then, as he sank into a velour-covered chair,\napologized again for the particular attention he was bestowing\nupon the apartment, which he recognized as one of the suites de\nluxe of the hotel.\n\n\"`Parlour, bedroom, and bath,'\" he continued, with a melancholy\nsmile; \"and `Lachrymae,' and `A Reading from Homer.' Sometimes\nthey have `The Music Lesson,' or `Winter Scene' or `A Neapolitan\nFisher Lad' instead of `Lachrymae,' but they always have `A\nReading from Homer.' When you opened the door, a moment ago, I had\na very strong impression that something extraordinary would some\ntime happen to me in this room.\"\n\n\"Well,\" suggested Corliss, \"you refused a drink in it.\"\n\n\"Even more wonderful than that,\" said Ray, glancing about the\nplace curiously. \"It may be a sense of something painful that\nalready has happened here--perhaps long ago, before your\noccupancy. It has a pathos.\"\n\n\"Most hotel rooms have had something happen in them,\" said Corliss\nlightly. \"I believe the managers usually change the door numbers\nif what happens is especially unpleasant. Probably they change\nsome of the rugs, also.\"\n\n\"I feel----\" Ray paused, frowning. \"I feel as if some one had\nkilled himself here.\"\n\n\"Then no doubt some of the rugs _have_ been changed.\"\n\n\"No doubt.\" The caller laughed and waved his hand in dismissal of\nthe topic. \"Well, Mr. Corliss,\" he went on, shifting to a brisker\ntone, \"I have come to make my fortune, too. You are Midas. Am I of\nsufficient importance to be touched?\"\n\nValentine Corliss gave him sidelong an almost imperceptibly brief\nglance of sharpest scrutiny--it was like the wink of a camera\nshutter--but laughed in the same instant. \"Which way do you mean\nthat?\"\n\n\"You have been quick,\" returned the visitor, repaying that glance\nwith equal swiftness, \"to seize upon the American idiom. I mean:\nHow small a contribution would you be willing to receive toward\nyour support!\"\n\nCorliss did not glance again at Ray; instead, he looked interested\nin the smoke of his cigar. \"`Contribution,'\" he repeated, with no\ninflection whatever. \"`Toward my support.'\"\n\n\"I mean, of course, how small an investment in your oil company.\"\n\n\"Oh, anything, anything,\" returned the promoter, with quick\namiability. \"We need to sell all the stock we can.\"\n\n\"All the money you can get?\"\n\n\"Precisely. It's really a colossal proposition, Mr. Vilas.\"\nCorliss spoke with brisk enthusiasm. \"It's a perfectly certain\nenormous profit upon everything that goes in. Prince Moliterno\ncables me later investigations show that the oil-field is more\nthan twice as large as we thought when I left Naples. He's on the\nground now, buying up what he can, secretly.\"\n\n\"I had an impression from Richard Lindley that the secret had been\ndiscovered.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; but only by a few, and those are trying to keep it quiet\nfrom the others, of course.\"\n\n\"I see. Does your partner know of your success in raising a large\ninvestment?\"\n\n\"You mean Lindley's? Certainly.\" Corliss waved his hand in light\ndeprecation. \"Of course that's something, but Moliterno would\nhardly be apt to think of it as very large! You see he's putting\nin about five times that much, himself, and I've already turned\nover to him double it for myself. Still, it counts--certainly; and\nof course it will be a great thing for Lindley.\"\n\n\"I fear,\" Ray said hesitatingly, \"you won't be much interested in\nmy drop for your bucket. I have twelve hundred dollars in the\nworld; and it is in the bank--I stopped there on my way here. To\nbe exact, I have twelve hundred and forty-seven dollars and\nfifty-one cents. My dear sir, will you allow me to purchase one\nthousand dollars' worth of stock? I will keep the two hundred and\nforty-seven dollars and fifty-one cents to live on--I may need an\negg while waiting for you to make me rich. Will you accept so\nsmall an investment?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Corliss, laughing. \"Why not? You may as well\nprofit by the chance as any one. I'll send you the stock\ncertificates--we put them at par. I'm attending to that myself, as\nour secretary, Mr. Madison, is unable to take up his duties.\"\n\nVilas took a cheque-book and a fountain-pen from his pocket.\n\n\"Oh, any time, any time,\" said Corliss cheerfully, observing the\nnew investor's movement.\n\n\"Now, I think,\" returned Vilas quietly. \"How shall I make it out?\"\n\n\"Oh, to me, I suppose,\" answered Corliss indifferently. \"That will\nsave a little trouble, and I can turn it over to Moliterno, by\ncable, as I did Lindley's. I'll give you a receipt----\"\n\n\"You need not mind that,\" said Ray. \"Really it is of no\nimportance.\"\n\n\"Of course the cheque itself is a receipt,\" remarked Corliss,\ntossing it carelessly upon a desk. \"You'll have some handsome\nreturns for that slip of paper, Mr. Vilas.\"\n\n\"In that blithe hope I came,\" said Ray airily.\n\n\"I am confident of it. I have my own ways of divination, Mr.\nCorliss. I have gleams.\" He rose as if to go, but stood looking\nthoughtfully about the apartment again. \"Singular impression,\" he\nmurmured. \"Not exactly as if I'd seen it in a dream; and yet--and\nyet----\"\n\n\"You have symptoms of clairvoyance at times, I take it.\" The\nconscious, smooth superiority of the dexterous man playing with an\ninconsequent opponent resounded in this speech, clear as the\nhumming of a struck bell; and Vilas shot him a single open glance\nof fire from hectic eyes. For that instant, the frailer buck\ntrumpeted challenge. Corliss--broad-shouldered, supple of waist,\ngraceful and strong--smiled down negligently; yet the very air\nbetween the two men seemed charged with an invisible explosive.\nRay laughed quickly, as in undisturbed good nature; then,\nflourishing his stick, turned toward the door.\n\n\"Oh, no, it isn't clairvoyance--no more than when I told you that\nyour only real interest is women.\" He paused, his hand upon the\ndoor-knob. \"I'm a quaint mixture, however: perhaps I should be\nhandled with care.\"\n\n\"Very good of you,\" laughed Corliss--\"this warning. The afternoon\nI had the pleasure of meeting you I think I remember your implying\nthat you were a mere marionette.\"\n\n\"A haggard harlequin!\" snapped Vilas, waving his hand to a mirror\nacross the room. \"Don't I look it?\" And the phrase fitted him with\ntragic accuracy. \"You see? What a merry wedding-guest I'll be! I\ninvite you to join me on the nuptial eve.\"\n\n\"Thanks. Who's getting married: when the nuptial eve?\"\n\nRay opened the door, and, turning, rolled his eyes fantastically.\n\"Haven't you heard?\" he cried. \"When Hecate marries John\nBarleycorn!\" He bowed low. \"Mr. Midas, adieu.\"\n\nCorliss stood in the doorway and watched him walk down the long\nhall to the elevator. There, Ray turned and waved his hand, the\nother responding with gayety which was not assumed: Vilas might be\ninsane, or drunk, or both, but the signature upon his cheque was\nunassailable.\n\nCorliss closed the door and began to pace his apartment\nthoughtfully. His expression manifested a peculiar phenomenon. In\ncompany, or upon the street, or when he talked with men, the open\nlook and frank eyes of this stalwart young man were disarming and\nhis most winning assets. But now, as he paced alone in his\napartment, now that he was not upon exhibition, now when there was\nno eye to behold him, and there was no reason to dissimulate or\nveil a single thought or feeling, his look was anything but open;\nthe last trace of frankness disappeared; the muscles at mouth and\neyes shifted; lines and planes intermingled and altered subtly;\nthere was a moment of misty transformation--and the face of\nanother man emerged. It was the face of a man uninstructed in\nmercy; it was a shrewd and planning face: alert, resourceful,\nelaborately perceptive, and flawlessly hard. But, beyond all, it\nwas the face of a man perpetually on guard.\n\nHe had the air of debating a question, his hands in his pockets,\nhis handsome forehead lined with a temporary indecision. His\nsentry-go extended the length of his two rooms, and each time he\ncame back into his bedroom his glance fell consideringly upon a\nsteamer-trunk of the largest size, at the foot of his bed. The\ntrunk was partially packed as if for departure. And, indeed, it\nwas the question of departure which he was debating.\n\nHe was a man of varied dexterities, and he had one faculty of high\nvalue, which had often saved him, had never betrayed him; it was\nintuitive and equal to a sixth sense: he always knew when it was\ntime to go. An inner voice warned him; he trusted to it and obeyed\nit. And it had spoken now, and there was his trunk half-packed in\nanswer. But he had stopped midway in his packing, because he had\nnever yet failed to make a clean sweep where there was the\nslightest chance for one; he hated to leave a big job before it\nwas completely finished--and Mr. Wade Trumble had refused to\ninvest in the oil-fields of Basilicata.\n\nCorliss paused beside the trunk, stood a moment immersed in\nthought; then nodded once, decisively, and, turning to a\ndressing-table, began to place some silver-mounted brushes and\nbottles in a leather travelling-case.\n\nThere was a knock at the outer door. He frowned, set down what he\nhad in his hands, went to the door and opened it to find Mr.\nPryor, that plain citizen, awaiting entrance.\n\nCorliss remained motionless in an arrested attitude, his hand upon\nthe knob of the opened door. His position did not alter; he became\nalmost unnaturally still, a rigidity which seemed to increase.\nThen he looked quickly behind him, over his shoulder, and back\nagain, with a swift movement of the head.\n\n\"No,\" said Pryor, at that. \"I don't want you. I just thought I'd\nhave two minutes' talk with you. All right?\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Corliss quietly. \"Come in.\" He turned\ncarelessly, and walked away from the door keeping between his\nguest and the desk. When he reached the desk, he turned again and\nleaned against it, his back to it, but in the action of turning\nhis hand had swept a sheet of note-paper over Ray Vilas's\ncheque--a too conspicuous oblong of pale blue. Pryor had come in\nand closed the door.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he began, regarding the other through his glasses,\nwith steady eyes, \"that I'm going to interfere with you at all,\nCorliss. I just happened to strike you--I wasn't looking for you.\nI'm on vacation, visiting my married daughter that lives here, and\nI don't want to mix in if I can help it.\"\n\nCorliss laughed, easily. \"There's nothing for you to mix in. You\ncouldn't if you wanted to.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope that's true,\" said Pryor, with an air of indulgence,\ncuriously like that of a teacher for a pupil who promises\nimprovement. \"I do indeed. There isn't anybody I'd like to see\nturn straight more than you. You're educated and cultured, and\nrefined, and smarter than all hell. It would be a big thing.\nThat's one reason I'm taking the trouble to talk to you.\"\n\n\"I told you I wasn't doing anything,\" said Corliss with a\npetulance as oddly like that of a pupil as the other's indulgence\nwas like that of a tutor. \"This is my own town; I own property\nhere, and I came here to sell it. I can prove it in\nhalf-a-minute's telephoning. Where do you come in?\"\n\n\"Easy, easy,\" said Pryor, soothingly. \"I've just told you I don't\nwant to come in at all.\"\n\n\"Then what do you want?\"\n\n\"I came to tell you just one thing: to go easy up there at Mr.\nMadison's house.\"\n\nCorliss laughed contemptuously. \"It's _my_ house. I own it. That's\nthe property I came here to sell.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know,\" responded Pryor. \"That part of it's all right. But\nI've seen you several times with that young lady, and you looked\npretty thick, to me. You know you haven't got any business doing\nsuch things, Corliss. I know your record from Buda Pesth to\nCopenhagen and----\"\n\n\"See here, my friend,\" said the younger man, angrily, \"you may be\na tiptop spotter for the government when it comes to running down\nsome poor old lady that's bought a string of pearls in the Rue de\nla Paix----\"\n\n\"I've been in the service twenty-eight years,\" remarked Pryor,\nmildly.\n\n\"All right,\" said the other with a gesture of impatience; \"and you\ngot me once, all right. Well, that's over, isn't it? Have I tried\nanything since?\"\n\n\"Not in that line,\" said Pryor.\n\n\"Well, what business have you with any other line?\" demanded\nCorliss angrily. \"Who made you general supervisor of public\nmorals? I want to know----\"\n\n\"Now, what's the use your getting excited? I'm just here to tell\nyou that I'm going to keep an eye on you. I don't know many people\nhere, and I haven't taken any particular pains to look you up. For\nall I know, you're only here to sell your house, as you say. But I\nknow old man Madison a little, and I kind of took a fancy to him;\nhe's a mighty nice old man, and he's got a nice family. He's sick\nand it won't do to trouble him; but--honest, Corliss--if you don't\nslack off in that neighbourhood a little, I'll have to have a talk\nwith the young lady herself.\"\n\nA derisory light showed faintly in the younger man's eyes as he\ninquired, softly: \"That all, Mr. Pryor?\"\n\n\"No. Don't try anything on out here. Not in _any_ of your lines.\"\n\n\"I don't mean to.\"\n\n\"That's right. Sell your house and clear out. You'll find it\nhealthy.\" He went to the door. \"So far as I can see,\" he observed,\nruminatively, \"you haven't brought any of that Moliterno crowd you\nused to work with over to this side with you.\"\n\n\"I haven't seen Moliterno for two years,\" said Corliss, sharply.\n\n\"Well, I've said my say.\" Pryor gave him a last word as he went\nout. \"You keep away from that little girl.\"\n\n\"Ass!\" exclaimed Corliss, as the door closed. He exhaled a deep\nbreath sharply, and broke into a laugh. Then he went quickly into\nhis bedroom and began to throw the things out of his trunk.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\n\nHedrick Madison's eyes were not of marble; his heart was not flint\nnor his skin steel plate: he was flesh and tender; he was a\nvulnerable, breathing boy, with highly developed capacities for\npain which were now being taxed to their utmost. Once he had loved\nto run, to leap, to disport himself in the sun, to drink deep of\nthe free air; he had loved life and one or two of his fellowmen.\nHe had borne himself buoyantly, with jaunty self-confidence, even\nwith some intolerance toward the weaknesses of others, not\ninfrequently displaying merriment over their mischances; but his\ntime had found him at last; the evil day had come. Indian Summer\nwas Indian for him, indeed: sweet death were welcome; no charity\nwas left in him. He leaped no more, but walked broodingly and\nsought the dark places. And yet it could not be said that times\nwere dull for him: the luckless picket who finds himself in an\nopen eighty-acre field, under the eye of a sharpshooter up a tree,\nwould not be apt to describe the experience as dull. And Cora\nnever missed a shot; she loved the work; her pleasure in it was\nalmost as agonizing for the target as was the accuracy of her\nfire.\n\nShe was ingenious: the horrible facts at her disposal were\ndamaging enough in all conscience: but they did not content her.\nShe invented a love-story, assuming that Hedrick was living it: he\nwas supposed to be pining for Lolita, to be fading, day-by-day,\nbecause of enforced separation; and she contrived this to such an\neffect of reality, and with such a diabolical affectation of\ndelicacy in referring to it, that the mere remark, with gentle\nsympathy, \"I think poor Hedrick is looking a little better\nto-day,\" infallibly produced something closely resembling a spasm.\nShe formed the habit of never mentioning her brother in his\npresence except as \"poor Hedrick,\" a too obvious commiseration of\nhis pretended attachment--which met with like success. Most\ndreadful of all, she invented romantic phrases and expressions\nassumed to have been spoken or written by Hedrick in reference to\nhis unhappiness; and she repeated them so persistently, yet always\nwith such apparent sincerity of belief that they were quotations\nfrom him, and not her inventions, that the driven youth knew a\nfear, sometimes, that the horrid things were actually of his own\nperpetration.\n\nThe most withering of these was, \"Torn from her I love by the\nruthless hand of a parent. . . .\" It was not completed; Cora never\ngot any further with it, nor was there need: a howl of fury\ninvariably assured her of an effect as satisfactory as could\npossibly have been obtained by an effort less impressionistic.\nLife became a series of easy victories for Cora, and she made them\nsomehow the more deadly for Hedrick by not seeming to look at him\nin his affliction, nor even to be aiming his way: he never could\ntell when the next shot was coming. At the table, the ladies of\nhis family might be deep in dress, or discussing Mr. Madison's\nslowly improving condition, when Cora, with utter irrelevance,\nwould sigh, and, looking sadly into her coffee, murmur, \"Ah,\n_fond_ mem'ries!\" or, \"_Why_ am I haunted by the dead past?\" or,\nthe dreadful, \"Torn from her I love by the ruthless hand of a\nparent. . . .\"\n\nThere was compassion in Laura's eyes and in his mother's, but Cora\nwas irresistible, and they always ended by laughing in spite of\nthemselves; and though they pleaded for Hedrick in private, their\nremonstrances proved strikingly ineffective. Hedrick was the only\nperson who had ever used the high hand with Cora: she found\nrepayment too congenial. In the daytime he could not go in the\nfront yard, but Cora's window would open and a tenderly smiling\nCora lean out to call affectionately, \"Don't walk on the\ngrass--darling little boy!\" Or, she would nod happily to him and\nbegin to sing:\n\n    \"Oh come beloved, love let me press thee,\n    While I caress thee\n    In one long kiss, Lolita. . . . \"\n\nOne terror still hung over him. If it fell--as it might at any\nfatal moment--then the utmost were indeed done upon him; and this\napprehension bathed his soul in night. In his own circle of\ncongenial age and sex he was, by virtue of superior bitterness and\nprecocity of speech, a chief--a moral castigator, a satirist of\nmanners, a creator of stinging nicknames; and many nourished\nunhealed grievances which they had little hope of satisfying\nagainst him; those who attempted it invariably departing with more\nto avenge than they had brought with them. Let these once know\nwhat Cora knew. . . . The vision was unthinkable!\n\nIt was Cora's patent desire to release the hideous item, to spread\nthe scandal broadcast among his fellows--to ring it from the\nschool-bells, to send it winging on the hot winds of Hades! The\nboys had always liked his yard and the empty stable to play in,\nand the devices he now employed to divert their activities\nelsewhere were worthy of a great strategist. His energy and an\nabnormal ingenuity accomplished incredible things: school had been\nin session several weeks and only one boy had come within\nconversational distance of Cora;--him Hedrick bore away bodily, in\nsimulation of resistless high spirits, a brilliant exhibition of\nstagecraft.\n\nAnd then Cora's friend, Mrs. Villard, removed her son Egerton from\nthe private school he had hitherto attended, and he made his\nappearance in Hedrick's class, one morning at the public school.\nHedrick's eye lighted with a savage gleam; timidly the first joy\nhe had known for a thousand years crept into his grim heart. After\nschool, Egerton expiated a part of Cora's cruelty. It was a very\nsmall part, and the exploit no more than infinitesimally soothing\nto the conqueror, but when Egerton finally got home he was no\nsight for a mother.\n\nThus Hedrick wrought his own doom: Mrs. Villard telephoned to\nCora, and Cora went immediately to see her.\n\nIt happened to Hedrick that he was late leaving home the next\nmorning. His entrance into his classroom was an undeniable\nsensation, and within ten minutes the teacher had lost all control\nof the school. It became necessary to send for the principal.\nRecess was a frantic nightmare for Hedrick, and his homeward\nprogress at noon a procession of such uproarious screamers as were\nhis equals in speed. The nethermost depths were reached when an\nignoble pigtailed person he had always trodden upon flat-footed\nscreamed across the fence from next door, as he reached fancied\nsanctuary in his own backyard:\n\n\"Kiss me some _more_, darling little boy!\"\n\nThis worm, established upon the fence opposite the conservatory\nwindows, and in direct view from the table in the dining-room,\nshrieked the accursed request at short intervals throughout the\nluncheon hour. The humour of childhood is sometimes almost\nintrusive.\n\nAnd now began a life for Hedrick which may be rather painfully but\ntruthfully likened to a prolongation of the experiences of a rat\nthat finds itself in the middle of a crowded street in daylight:\nthere is plenty of excitement but no pleasure. He was pursued,\nharried, hounded from early morning till nightfall, and even in\nhis bed would hear shrill shouts go down the sidewalk from the\nthroats of juvenile fly-by-nights: \"Oh dar-ling lit-oh darling\nlit-oh _lit_-le boy, _lit_-le boy, kiss me some _more_!\" And one\nday he overheard a remark which strengthened his growing\nconviction that the cataclysm had affected the whole United\nStates: it was a teacher who spoke, explaining to another a\ndisturbance in the hall of the school. She said, behind her hand:\n\n\"_He kissed an idiot_.\"\n\nLaura had not even remotely foreseen the consequences of her\nrevelation, nor, indeed, did she now properly estimate their\neffect upon Hedrick. She and her mother were both sorry for him,\nand did what they could to alleviate his misfortunes, but there\nwas an inevitable remnant of amusement in their sympathy. Youth,\nat war, affects stoicism but not resignation: in truth,\nresignation was not much in Hedrick's line, and it would be far\nfrom the fact to say that he was softened by his sufferings. He\nbrooded profoundly and his brightest thought was revenge. It was\nnot upon Cora that his chief bitterness turned. Cora had always\nbeen the constant, open enemy: warfare between them was a regular\ncondition of life; and unconsciously, and without \"thinking it\nout,\" he recognized the naturalness of her seizing upon the\ndeadliest weapon against him that came to her hand. There was\nnothing unexpected in that: no, the treachery, to his mind, lay in\nthe act of Laura, that non-combatant, who had furnished the\nnatural and habitual enemy with this scourge. At all times, and\nwith or without cause, he ever stood ready to do anything possible\nfor the reduction of Cora's cockiness, but now it was for the\ntaking-down of Laura and the repayment of her uncalled-for and\noverwhelming assistance to the opposite camp that he lay awake\nnights and kept his imagination hot. Laura was a serene person, so\nneutral--outwardly, at least--and so little concerned for herself\nin any matter he could bring to mind, that for purposes of revenge\nshe was a difficult proposition. And then, in a desperate hour, he\nremembered her book.\n\nOnly once had he glimpsed it, but she had shown unmistakable\nagitation of a mysterious sort as she wrote in it, and, upon\nobserving his presence, a prompt determination to prevent his\nreading a word of what she had written. Therefore, it was\nsomething peculiarly sacred and intimate. This deduction was\nproved by the care she exercised in keeping the book concealed\nfrom all eyes. A slow satisfaction began to permeate him: he made\nup his mind to find that padlocked ledger.\n\nHe determined with devoted ardour that when he found it he would\nmake the worst possible use of it: the worst, that is, for Laura.\nAs for consequences to himself, he was beyond them. There is an\nIrish play in which an old woman finds that she no longer fears\nthe sea when it has drowned the last of her sons; it can do\nnothing more to her. Hedrick no longer feared anything.\n\nThe book was somewhere in Laura's room, he knew that; and there\nwere enough opportunities to search, though Laura had a way of\ncoming in unexpectedly which was embarrassing; and he suffered\nfrom a sense of inadequacy when--on the occasion of his first new\nattempt--he answered the casual inquiry as to his presence by\nsaying that he \"had a headache.\" He felt there was something\nindirect in the reply; but Laura was unsuspicious and showed no\ndisposition to be analytical. After this, he took the precaution\nto bring a school-book with him and she often found the boy seated\nquietly by her west window immersed in study: he said he thought\nhis headaches came from his eyes and that the west light \"sort of\neased them a little.\"\n\nThe ledger remained undiscovered, although probably there has\nnever been a room more thoroughly and painstakingly searched,\nwithout its floor being taken up and its walls torn down. The most\nmysterious, and, at the same time, the most maddening thing about\nit was the apparent simplicity of the task. He was certain that\nthe room contained the book: listening, barefooted, outside the\ndoor at night, he had heard the pen scratching. The room was as\nplain as a room can be, and small. There was a scantily filled\nclothes-press; he had explored every cubic inch of it. There was\nthe small writing table with one drawer; it held only some\nnote-paper and a box of pen-points. There was a bureau; to his\ncertain knowledge it contained no secret whatever. There were a\nfew giltless chairs, and a white \"wash-stand,\" a mere basin and\nslab with exposed plumbing. Lastly, there was the bed, a very\nlarge and ugly \"Eastlake\" contrivance; he had acquired a close\nacquaintance with all of it except the interior of the huge\nmattress itself, and here, he finally concluded, must of necessity\nbe the solution. The surface of the mattress he knew to be\nunbroken; nevertheless the book was there. He had recently\nstimulated his deductive powers with a narrative of French\njournalistic sagacity in a similar case; and he applied French\nreasoning. The ledger existed. It was somewhere in the room. He\nhad searched everything except the interior of the mattress. The\nledger was in that interior.\n\nThe exploration thus become necessary presented some difficulties.\nDetection in the act would involve explanations hard to invent; it\nwould not do to say he was looking for his knife; and he could not\nthink of any excuse altogether free from a flavour of insincerity.\nA lameness beset them all and made them liable to suspicion; and\nLaura, once suspicious, might be petty enough to destroy the book,\nand so put it out of his power forever. He must await the right\nopportunity, and, after a racking exercise of patience, at last he\nsaw it coming.\n\nDoctor Sloane had permitted his patient to come down stairs for an\nincreasing interval each day. Mr. Madison crept, rather than\nwalked, leaning upon his wife and closely attended by Miss Peirce.\nHe spoke with difficulty and not clearly; still, there was a\nperceptible improvement, and his family were falling into the\nhabit of speaking of him as almost well. On that account, Mrs.\nMadison urged her daughters to accept an invitation from the\nmother of the once courtly Egerton Villard. It was at breakfast\nthat the matter was discussed.\n\n\"Of course Cora must go,\" Laura began, \"but----\"\n\n\"But nothing!\" interrupted Cora. \"How would it look if I went and\nyou didn't? Everybody knows papa's almost well, and they'd think\nit silly for us to give up the first real dance since last spring\non that account; yet they're just spiteful enough, if I went and\nyou stayed home, to call me a `girl of no heart.' Besides,\" she\nadded sweetly, \"we ought to go to show Mrs. Villard we aren't hurt\nbecause Egerton takes so little notice of poor Hedrick.\"\n\nHedrick's lips moved silently, as in prayer.\n\n\"I'd rather not,\" said Laura. \"I doubt if I'd have a very good\ntime.\"\n\n\"You would, too,\" returned her sister, decidedly. \"The men like to\ndance with you; you dance every bit as well as I do, and that\nblack lace is the most becoming dress you ever had. Nobody ever\nremembers a black dress, anyway, unless it's cut very\nconspicuously, and yours isn't. I can't go without you; they love\nto say nasty things about me, and you're too good a sister to give\n'em this chance, you old dear.\" She laughed and nodded\naffectionately across the table at Laura. \"You've got to go!\"\n\n\"Yes, it would be nicer,\" said the mother. And so it was settled.\nIt was simultaneously settled in Hedrick's mind that the night of\nthe dance should mark his discovery of the ledger. He would have\nsome industrious hours alone with the mysterious mattress, safe\nfrom intrusion.\n\nMeekly he lifted his eyes from his plate. \"I'm glad you're going,\nsister Laura,\" he said in a gentle voice. \"I think a change will\ndo you good.\"\n\n\"Isn't it wonderful,\" exclaimed Cora, appealing to the others to\nobserve him, \"what an improvement a disappointment in love can\nmake in deportment?\"\n\nFor once, Hedrick only smiled.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\n\nLaura had spent some thoughtful hours upon her black lace dress\nwith results that astonished her family: it became a\nball-gown--and a splendidly effective one. She arranged her dark\nhair in a more elaborate fashion than ever before, in a close\ncoronal of faintly lustrous braids; she had no jewellery and\nobviously needed none. Her last action but one before she left her\nroom was to dispose of the slender chain and key she always wore\nround her neck; then her final glance at the mirror--which fairly\nrevealed a lovely woman--ended in a deprecatory little \"face\" she\nmade at herself. It meant: \"Yes, old lady, you fancy yourself very\npassable in here all by yourself, don't you? Just wait: you'll be\nstanding beside Cora in a moment!\"\n\nAnd when she did stand beside Cora, in the latter's room, a moment\nlater, her thought seemed warranted. Cora, radiant-eyed, in high\nbloom, and exquisite from head to foot in a shimmering white\ndancing-dress, a glittering crescent fastening the silver fillet\nthat bound her vivid hair, was a flame of enchantment. Mrs.\nMadison, almost weeping with delight, led her daughters proudly,\nan arm round the waist of each, into her husband's room. Propped\nwith pillows, he reclined in an armchair while Miss Peirce\nprepared his bed, an occupation she gave over upon this dazzling\nentrance, departing tactfully.\n\n\"Look at these,\" cried the mother; \"--from our garden, Jim, dear!\nDon't we feel rich, you and I?\"\n\n\"And--and--Laura,\" said the sick man, with the slow and imperfect\nenunication caused by his disease; \"Laura looks pretty--too.\"\n\n\"Isn't she adorable!\" Cora exclaimed warmly. \"She decided to be\nthe portrait of a young duchess, you see, all stately\nsplendour--made of snow and midnight!\"\n\n\"Hear! hear!\" laughed Laura; but she blushed with pleasure, and\ntaking Cora's hand in hers lifted it to her lips.\n\n\"And do you see Cora's crescent?\" demanded Mrs. Madison. \"What do\nyou think of _that_ for magnificence? She went down town this\nmorning with seven dollars, and came back with that and her party\ngloves and a dollar in change! Isn't she a bargainer? Even for\nrhinestones they are the cheapest things you ever heard of. They\nlook precisely like stones of the very finest water.\" They did--so\nprecisely, indeed, that if the resemblance did not amount to\nactual identity, then had a jeweller of the town been able to\ndeceive the eye of Valentine Corliss, which was an eye singularly\nlearned in such matters.\n\n\"They're--both smart girls,\" said Madison, \"both of them. And they\nlook--beautiful, to-night--both. Laura is--amazing!\"\n\nWhen they had gone, Mrs. Madison returned from the stairway, and,\nkneeling beside her husband, put her arms round him gently: she\nhad seen the tear that was marking its irregular pathway down his\nflaccid, gray cheek, and she understood.\n\n\"Don't. Don't worry, Jim,\" she whispered. \"Those bright, beautiful\nthings!--aren't they treasures?\"\n\n\"It's--it's Laura,\" he said. \"Cora will be all right. She looks\nout for--herself. I'm--I'm afraid for--Laura. Aren't you?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" she protested. \"I'm not afraid for either of them.\" But\nshe was: the mother had always been afraid for Cora.\n\n. . . . At the dance, the two girls, attended up the stairway to\nthe ballroom by a chattering covey of black-coats, made a\nsensational entrance to a gallant fanfare of music, an effect\nwhich may have been timed to the premonitory tuning of instruments\nheard during the ascent; at all events, it was a great success;\nand Cora, standing revealed under the wide gilt archway, might\nhave been a lithe and shining figure from the year\neighteen-hundred-and-one, about to dance at the Luxembourg. She\nplaced her hand upon the sleeve of Richard Lindley, and, glancing\nintelligently over his shoulder into the eyes of Valentine\nCorliss, glided rhythmically away.\n\nPeople looked at her; they always did. Not only the non-dancers\nwatched her; eyes everywhere were upon her, even though the owners\ngyrated, glided and dipped on distant orbits. The other girls\nwatched her, as a rule, with a profound, an almost passionate\ncuriosity; and they were prompt to speak well of her to men,\nexcept in trustworthy intimacy, because they did not enjoy being\nwrongfully thought jealous. Many of them kept somewhat aloof from\nher; but none of them ever nowadays showed \"superiority\" in her\npresence, or snubbed her: that had been tried and proved\ndisastrous in rebound. Cora never failed to pay her score--and\nwith a terrifying interest added, her native tendency being to\ntake two eyes for an eye and the whole jaw for a tooth. They let\nher alone, though they asked and asked among themselves the\nnever-monotonous question: \"Why do men fall in love with girls\nlike that?\" a riddle which, solved, makes wives condescending to\ntheir husbands.\n\nMost of the people at this dance had known one another as friends,\nor antagonists, or indifferent acquaintances, for years, and in\nsuch an assembly there are always two worlds, that of the women\nand that of the men. Each has its own vision, radically different\nfrom that of the other; but the greatest difference is that the\nmen are unaware of the other world, only a few of them--usually\nqueer ones like Ray Vilas--vaguely perceiving that there are two\nvisions, while all the women understand both perfectly. The men\nsplash about on the surface; the women keep their eyes open under\nwater. Or, the life of the assembly is like a bright tapestry: the\nmen take it as a picture and are not troubled to know how it is\nproduced; but women are weavers. There was a Beauty of far-flung\nrenown at Mrs. Villard's to-night: Mary Kane, a creature so made\nand coloured that young men at sight of her became as water and\nolder men were apt to wonder regretfully why all women could not\nhave been made like Mary. She was a kindly soul, and never\nintentionally outshone her sisters; but the perfect sumptuousness\nof her had sometimes tried the amiability of Cora Madison, to whom\nsuch success without effort and without spark seemed unfair, as\nwell as bovine. Miss Kane was a central figure at the dance,\nshining tranquilly in a new triumph: that day her engagement had\nbeen announced to Mr. George Wattling, a young man of no special\nattainments, but desirable in his possessions and suitable to his\nhappiness. The pair radiated the pardonable, gay importance of\nnewly engaged people, and Cora, who had never before bestowed any\nnotice upon Mr. Wattling, now examined him with thoughtful\nattention.\n\nFinding him at her elbow in a group about a punch bowl, between\ndances, she offered warm felicitations. \"But I don't suppose you\ncare whether _I_ care for you to be happy or not,\" she added, with\na little plaintive laugh;--\"you've always hated me so!\"\n\nMr. Wattling was startled: never before had he imagined that Cora\nMadison had given him a thought; but there was not only thought,\nthere was feeling, in this speech. She seemed to be concealing\nwith bravery an even deeper feeling than the one inadvertently\nexpressed. \"Why, what on earth makes you think that?\" he\nexclaimed.\n\n\"Think it? I _know_ it!\" She gave him a strange look, luminous yet\nmysterious, a curtain withdrawn only to show a shining mist with\nsomething undefined but dazzling beyond. \"I've always known it!\"\nAnd she turned away from him abruptly.\n\nHe sprang after her. \"But you're wrong. I've never----\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you have.\" They began to discuss it, and for better\nconsideration of the theme it became necessary for Cora to \"cut\"\nthe next dance, promised to another, and to give it to Mr.\nWattling. They danced several times together, and Mr. Wattling's\nexpression was serious. The weavers of the tapestry smiled and\nwhispered things the men would not have understood--nor believed.\n\nRay Vilas, seated alone in a recessed and softly lighted gallery,\ndid not once lose sight of the flitting sorceress. With his elbows\non the railing, he leaned out, his head swaying slowly and\nmechanically as she swept up and down the tumultuously moving\nroom, his passionate eyes gaunt and brilliant with his hunger. And\nsomething very like a general thrill passed over the assembly\nwhen, a little later, it was seen that he was dancing with her.\nLaura, catching a glimpse of this couple, started and looked\nprofoundly disturbed.\n\nThe extravagance of Vilas's passion and the depths he sounded, in\nhis absurd despair when discarded, had been matters of almost\npublic gossip; he was accounted a somewhat scandalous and\nunbalanced but picturesque figure; and for the lady whose light\nhand had wrought such havoc upon him to be seen dancing with him\nwas sufficiently startling to elicit the universal\nremark--evidently considered superlative--that it was \"just like\nCora Madison!\" Cora usually perceived, with an admirably clear\nhead, all that went on about her; and she was conscious of\nincreasing the sensation, when after a few turns round the room,\nshe allowed her partner to conduct her to a secluding grove of\npalms in the gallery. She sank into the chair he offered, and,\nfixing her eyes upon a small lamp of coloured glass which hung\noverhead, ostentatiously looked bored.\n\n\"At your feet, Cora,\" he said, seating himself upon a stool, and\nleaning toward her. \"Isn't it appropriate that we should talk to\nmusic--we two? It shouldn't be that quick step though--not\ndance-music--should it?\"\n\n\"Don't know 'm sure,\" murmured Cora.\n\n\"You were kind to dance with me,\" he said huskily. \"I dared to\nspeak to you----\"\n\nShe did not change her attitude nor the direction of her glance.\n\"I couldn't cut you very well with the whole town looking on. I'm\ntired of being talked about. Besides, I don't care much who I\ndance with--so he doesn't step on me.\"\n\n\"Cora,\" he said, \"it is the prelude to `L'Arlesienne' that they\nshould play for you and me. Yes, I think it should be that.\"\n\n\"Never heard of it.\"\n\n\"It's just a rustic tragedy, the story of a boy in the south of\nFrance who lets love become his whole life, and then--it kills\nhim.\"\n\n\"Sounds very stupid,\" she commented languidly.\n\n\"People do sometimes die of love, even nowadays,\" he said,\ntremulously--\"in the South.\"\n\nShe let her eyes drift indifferently to him and perceived that he\nwas trembling from head to foot; that his hands and knees shook\npiteously; that his lips quivered and twitched; and, at sight of\nthis agitation, an expression of strong distaste came to her face.\n\n\"I see.\" Her eyes returned to the lamp. \"You're from the South,\nand of course it's going to kill you.\"\n\n\"You didn't speak the exact words you had in your mind.'\"\n\n\"Oh, what words did I have `in my mind'?\" she asked impatiently.\n\n\"What you really meant was: `If it does kill you, what of it?'\"\n\nShe laughed, and sighed as for release.\n\n\"Cora,\" he said huskily, \"I understand you a little because you\npossess me. I've never--literally never--had another thought since\nthe first time I saw you: nothing but you. I think of\nyou--actually every moment. Drunk or sober, asleep or--awake, it's\nnothing but you, you, _you_! It will never be different: I don't\nknow why I can't get over it--I only know I can't. You own me; you\nburn like a hot coal in my heart. You're through with me, I know.\nYou drained me dry. You're like a child who eats so heartily of\nwhat he likes that he never touches it again. And I'm a dish\nyou're sick of. Oh, it's all plain enough, I can tell you. I'm not\nexciting any more--no, just a nauseous slave!\"\n\n\"Do you want people to hear you?\" she inquired angrily, for his\nvoice had risen.\n\nHe tempered his tone. \"Cora, when you liked me you went a pretty\nclipping gait with me,\" he said, trembling even more than before.\n\"But you're infinitely more infatuated with this Toreador of a\nCorliss than you were with me; you're lost in him; you're slaving\nfor him as I would for you. How far are you going with----\"\n\n\"Do you want me to walk away and leave you?\" she asked, suddenly\nsitting up straight and looking at him with dilating eyes. \"If you\nwant a `scene'----\"\n\n\"It's over,\" he said, more calmly. \"I know now how dangerous the\nman is. Of course you will tell him I said that.\" He laughed\nquietly. \"Well--between a dangerous chap and a desperate one, we\nmay look for some lively times! Do you know, I believe I think\nabout as continuously of him, lately, as I do of you. That's why I\nput almost my last cent into his oil company, and got what may be\nalmost my last dance with you!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't call it `almost' your last dance with me!\" she\nreturned icily. \"Not after what you've said. I had a foolish idea\nyou could behave--well, at least decently.\"\n\n\"Did Corliss tell you that I insulted him in his rooms at the\nhotel?\"\n\n\"You!\" She laughed, genuinely. \"I see him letting you!\"\n\n\"He did, however. By manner and in speech I purposely and\ndeliberately insulted him. You'll tell him every word of this, of\ncourse, and he'll laugh at it, but I give myself the pleasure of\ntelling you. I put the proposition of an `investment' to him in a\nway nobody not a crook would have allowed to be smoothed over--and\nhe allowed it to be smoothed over. He ate it! I felt he was a\nswindler when he was showing Richard Lindley his maps and papers,\nand now I've proved it to myself, and it's worth the price.\"\nOften, when they had danced, and often during this interview, his\neyes lifted curiously to the white flaming crescent in her hair;\nnow they fixed themselves upon it, and in a flash of divination he\ncried: \"You wear it for me!\"\n\nShe did not understand. \"Finished raving?\" she inquired.\n\n\"I gave Corliss a thousand dollars,\" he said, slowly. \"Considering\nthe fact that it was my last, I flatter myself it was not\nunhandsomely done--though I may never need it. It has struck me\nthat the sum was about what a man who had just cleaned up fifty\nthousand might regard as a sort of `extra'--`for lagniappe'--and\nthat he might have thought it an appropriate amount to invest in a\npresent some jewels perhaps--to place in the hair of a pretty\nfriend!\"\n\nShe sprang to her feet, furious, but he stood in front of her and\nwas able to bar the way for a moment.\n\n\"Cora, I'll have a last word with you if I have to hold you,\" he\nsaid with great rapidity and in a voice which shook with the\nintense repression he was putting upon himself. \"We do one thing\nin the South, where I came from. We protect our women----\"\n\n\"This looks like it! Keeping me when----\"\n\n\"I love you,\" he said, his face whiter than she had ever seen it.\n\"I love you! I'm your dog! You take care of yourself if you want\nto take care of anybody else! As sure as----\"\n\n\"My dance, Miss Madison.\" A young gentleman on vacation from the\nnavy had approached, and, with perfect unconsciousness of what he\nwas interrupting, but with well-founded certainty that he was\nwelcome to the lady, urged his claim in a confident voice. \"I\nthought it would never come, you know; but it's here at last and\nso am I.\" He laughed propitiatingly.\n\nRay yielded now at once. She moved him aside with her gloved\nforearm as if he were merely an awkward stranger who unwittingly\nstood between her and the claiming partner. Carrying the gesture\nfarther, she took the latter's arm, and smilingly, and without a\nbackward glance, passed onward and left the gallery. The\nlieutenant, who had met her once or twice before, was her partner\nfor the succeeding dance as well, and, having noted the advantages\nof the place where he had discovered her, persuaded her to return\nthere to sit through the second. Then without any fatiguing\npreamble, he proposed marriage. Cora did not accept, but effected\na compromise, which, for the present, was to consist of an\nexchange of photographs (his to be in uniform) and letters.\n\nShe was having an evening to her heart. Ray's attack on Corliss\nhad no dimming effect; her thought of it being that she was \"used\nto his raving\"; it meant nothing; and since Ray had prophesied she\nwould tell Corliss about it, she decided not to do so.\n\nThe naval young gentleman and Valentine Corliss were the greatest\nof all the lions among ladies that night; she had easily annexed\nthe lieutenant, and Corliss was hers already; though, for a\npurpose, she had not yet been seen in company with him. He was\nvisibly \"making an impression.\" His name, as he had said to\nRichard Lindley, was held in honour in the town; and there was a\nflavour of fancied romance in his absence since boyhood in unknown\nparts, and his return now with a `foreign air' and a bow that\nalmost took the breath of some of the younger recipients. He was,\ntoo, in his way, the handsomest man in the room; and the smiling,\nopen frankness of his look, the ready cordiality of his manner,\nwere found very winning. He caused plenty of flutter.\n\nCora waited till the evening was half over before she gave him any\nvisible attention. Then, during a silence of the music, between\ntwo dances, she made him a negligent sign with her hand, the\ngesture of one indifferently beckoning a creature who is certain\nto come, and went on talking casually to the man who was with her.\nCorliss was the length of the room from her, chatting gayly with a\nlarge group of girls and women; but he immediately nodded to her,\nmade his bow to individuals of the group, and crossed the vacant,\nglistening floor to her. Cora gave him no greeting whatever; she\ndismissed her former partner and carelessly turned away with\nCorliss to some chairs in a corner.\n\n\"Do you see that?\" asked Vilas, leaning over the balcony railing\nwith Richard Lindley. \"Look! She's showing the other girls--don't\nyou see? He's the New Man; she let 'em hope she wasn't going in\nfor him; a lot of them probably didn't even know that she knew\nhim. She sent him out on parade till they're all excited about\nhim; now she shows 'em he's entirely her property--and does it so\nmatter-of-factly that it's rubbed in twice as hard as if she\nseemed to take some pains about it. He doesn't dance: she'll sit\nout with him now, till they all read the tag she's put on him. She\nsays she hates being talked about. She lives on it!--so long as\nit's envious. And did you see her with that chap from the navy?\nNeptune thinks he's dallying with Venus perhaps, but he'll\nget----\"\n\nLindley looked at him commiseratingly. \"I think I never saw\nprettier decorations. Have you noticed, Ray? Must have used a\nthousand chrysanthemums.\"\n\n\"Toreador!\" whispered the other between his teeth, looking at\nCorliss; then, turning to his companion, he asked: \"Has it\noccurred to you to get any information about Basilicata, or about\nthe ancestral domain of the Moliterni, from our consul-general at\nNaples?\"\n\nRichard hesitated. \"Well--yes. Yes, I did think of that. Yes, I\nthought of it.\"\n\n\"But you didn't do it.\"\n\n\"No. That is, I haven't yet. You see, Corliss explained to me\nthat----\"\n\nHis friend interrupted him with a sour laugh. \"Oh, certainly! He's\none of the greatest explainers ever welcomed to our city!\"\n\nRichard said mildly: \"And then, Ray, once I've gone into a thing\nI--I don't like to seem suspicious.\"\n\n\"Poor old Dick!\" returned Vilas compassionately. \"You kind, easy,\nsincere men are so conscientiously untruthful with yourselves. You\nknow in your heart that Cora would be furious with you if you\nseemed suspicious, and she's been so nice to you since you put in\nyour savings to please her, that you can't bear to risk offending\nher. She's twisted you around her little finger, and the unnamed\nfear that haunts you is that you won't be allowed to stay\nthere--even twisted!\"\n\n\"Pretty decorations, Ray,\" said Richard; but he grew very red.\n\n\"Do you know what you'll do,\" asked Ray, regarding him keenly, \"if\nthis Don Giovanni from Sunny It' is shown up as a plain\nget-rich-quick swindler?\"\n\n\"I haven't considered----\"\n\n\"You would do precisely,\" said Ray, \"nothing! Cora'd see to that.\nYou'd sigh and go to work again, beginning at the beginning where\nyou were years ago, and doing it all over. Admirable resignation,\nbut not for me! I'm a stockholder in his company and in shape to\n`take steps'! I don't know if I'd be patient enough to make them\nlegal--perhaps I should. He may be safe on the legal side. I'll\nknow more about that when I find out if there is a Prince\nMoliterno in Naples who owns land in Basilicata.\"\n\n\"You don't doubt it?\"\n\n\"I doubt everything! In this particular matter I'll have less to\ndoubt when I get an answer from the consul-general. _I_'ve\nwritten, you see.\"\n\nLindley looked disturbed. \"You have?\"\n\nVilas read him at a glance. \"You're afraid to find out!\" he cried.\nThen he set his hand on the other's shoulder. \"If there ever was a\nGod's fool, it's you, Dick Lindley. Really, I wonder the world\nhasn't kicked you around more than it has; you'd never kick back!\nYou're as easy as an old shoe. Cora makes you unhappy,\" he went\non, and with the very mention of her name, his voice shook with\npassion,--\"but on my soul I don't believe you know what jealousy\nmeans: you don't even understand hate; you don't eat your\nheart----\"\n\n\"Let's go and eat something better,\" suggested Richard, laughing.\n\"There's a continuous supper downstairs and I hear it's very\ngood.\"\n\nRay smiled, rescued for a second from himself. \"There isn't\nanything better than your heart, you old window-pane, and I'm glad\nyou don't eat it. And if I ever mix it up with Don Giovanni T.\nCorliss--`T' stands for Toreador--I do believe it'll be partly on\nyour----\" He paused, leaving the sentence unfinished, as his\nattention was caught by the abysmal attitude of a figure in\nanother part of the gallery: Mr. Wade Trumble, alone in a corner,\nsitting upon the small of his small back, munching at an unlighted\ncigar and otherwise manifesting a biting gloom. Ray drew Lindley's\nattention to this tableau of pain. \"Here's a three of us!\" he\nsaid. He turned to look down into the rhythmic kaleidoscope of\ndancers. \"And there goes the girl we all _ought_ to be morbid\nabout.\"\n\n\"Who is that?\"\n\n\"Laura Madison. Why aren't we? What a self-respecting creature she\nis, with that cool, sweet steadiness of hers--she's like a\nmountain lake. She's lovely and she plays like an angel, but so\nfar as anybody's ever thinking about her is concerned she might\nalmost as well not exist. Yet she's really beautiful to-night, if\nyou can manage to think of her except as a sort of retinue for\nCora.\"\n\n\"She _is_ rather beautiful to-night. Laura's always a very\nnice-looking girl,\" said Richard, and with the advent of an idea,\nhe added: \"I think one reason she isn't more conspicuous and\nthought about is that she is so quiet,\" and, upon his companion's\ngreeting this inspiration with a burst of laughter, \"Yes, that was\na brilliant deduction,\" he said; \"but I do think she's about the\nquietest person I ever knew. I've noticed there are times when\nshe'll scarcely speak at all for half an hour, or even more.\"\n\n\"You're not precisely noisy yourself,\" said Ray. \"Have you danced\nwith her this evening?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" returned the other, in a tone which showed this\nomission to be a discovery; \"not yet. I must, of course.\"\n\n\"Yes, she's really `rather' beautiful. Also, she dances `rather'\nbetter than any other girl in town. Go and perform your painful\nduty.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I'd better,\" said Richard thoughtfully, not perceiving\nthe satire. \"At any rate, I'll ask her for the next.\"\n\nHe found it unengaged. There came to Laura's face an April change\nas he approached, and she saw he meant to ask her to dance. And,\nas they swam out into the maelstrom, he noticed it, and remarked\nthat it _was_ rather warm, to which she replied by a cheerful nod.\nPresently there came into Richard's mind the thought that he was\nreally an excellent dancer; but he did not recall that he had\nalways formed the same pleasing estimate of himself when he danced\nwith Laura, nor realize that other young men enjoyed similar\nself-help when dancing with her. And yet he repeated to her what\nRay had said of her dancing, and when she laughed as in\nappreciation of a thing intended humorously, he laughed, too, but\ninsisted that she did dance \"very well indeed.\" She laughed again\nat that, and they danced on, not talking. He had no sense of\n\"guiding\" her; there was no feeling of effort whatever; she seemed\nto move spontaneously with his wish, not to his touch; indeed, he\nwas not sensible of touching her at all.\n\n\"Why, Laura,\" he exclaimed suddenly, \"you dance _beautifully_!\"\n\nShe stumbled and almost fell; saved herself by clutching at his\narm; he caught her; and the pair stopped where they were, in the\nmiddle of the floor. A flash of dazed incredulity from her dark\neyes swept him; there was something in it of the child dodging an\nunexpected blow.\n\n\"Did I trip you?\" he asked anxiously.\n\n\"No,\" she laughed, quickly, and her cheeks grew even redder. \"I\ntripped myself. Wasn't that too bad--just when you were thinking\nthat I danced well! Let's sit down. May we?\"\n\nThey went to some chairs against a wall. There, as they sat, Cora\nswung by them, dancing again with her lieutenant, and looking up\ntrancedly into the gallant eyes of the triumphant and intoxicated\nyoung man. Visibly, she was a woman with a suitor's embracing arm\nabout her. Richard's eyes followed them.\n\n\"Ah, don't!\" said Laura in a low voice.\n\nHe turned to her. \"Don't what?\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to speak out loud,\" she said tremulously. \"But I\nmeant: don't look so troubled. It doesn't mean anything at\nall--her coquetting with that bird of passage. He's going away in\nthe morning.\"\n\n\"I don't think I was troubling about that.\"\n\n\"Well, whatever it was\"--she paused, and laughed with a plaintive\ntimidity--\"why, just don't trouble about it!\"\n\n\"Do I look very much troubled?\" he asked seriously.\n\n\"Yes. And you don't look very gay when you're not!\" She laughed\nwith more assurance now. \"I think you're always the wistfulest\nlooking man I ever saw.\"\n\n\"Everybody laughs at me, I believe,\" he said, with continued\nseriousness. \"Even Ray Vilas thinks I'm an utter fool. Am I, do\n_you_ think?\"\n\nHe turned as he spoke and glanced inquiringly into her eyes. What\nhe saw surprised and dismayed him.\n\n\"For heaven's sake, don't cry!\" he whispered hurriedly.\n\nShe bent her head, turning her face from him.\n\n\"I've been very hopeful lately,\" he said. \"Cora has been so kind\nto me since I did what she wanted me to, that I----\" He gave a\ndeep sigh. \"But if you're _that_ sorry for me, my chances with her\nmust be pretty desperate.\"\n\nShe did not alter her attitude, but with her down-bent face still\naway from him, said huskily: \"It isn't you I'm sorry for. You\nmustn't ever give up; you must keep on trying and trying. If you\ngive up, I don't know what will become of her!\"\n\nA moment later she rose suddenly to her feet. \"Let's finish our\ndance,\" she said, giving him her hand. \"I'm sure I won't stumble\nagain.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\n\nThe two girls let themselves into the house noiselessly, and,\nturning out the hall-light, left for them by their mother, crept\nupstairs on tiptoe; and went through the upper hall directly to\nLaura's room--Cora's being nearer the sick-room. At their age it\nis proper that a gayety be used three times: in anticipation, and\nactually, and in after-rehearsal. The last was of course now in\norder: they went to Laura's room to \"talk it over.\" There was no\ngas-fixture in this small chamber; but they found Laura's oil-lamp\nburning brightly upon her writing-table.\n\n\"How queer!\" said Laura with some surprise, as she closed the\ndoor. \"Mother never leaves the lamp lit for me; she's always so\nafraid of lamps exploding.\"\n\n\"Perhaps Miss Peirce came in here to read, and forgot to turn it\nout,\" suggested Cora, seating herself on the edge of the bed and\nletting her silk wrap fall from her shoulders. \"Oh, Laura, wasn't\nhe gorgeous. . . .\"\n\nShe referred to the gallant defender of our seas, it appeared, and\nwhile Laura undressed and got into a wrapper, Cora recounted in\ndetail the history of the impetuous sailor's enthrallment;--a\nresume predicted three hours earlier by a gleeful whisper hissed\nacross the maritime shoulder as the sisters swung near each other\nduring a waltz: \"_proposed_!\"\n\n\"I've always heard they're horribly inconstant,\" she said,\nregretfully. \"But, oh, Laura, wasn't he beautiful to look at! Do\nyou think he's more beautiful than Val? No--don't tell me if you\ndo. I don't want to hear it! Val was so provoking: he didn't seem\nto mind it at all. He's nothing but a big brute sometimes: he\nwouldn't even admit that he minded, when I asked him. I was idiot\nenough to ask; I couldn't help it; he was so tantalizing and\nexasperating--laughing at me. I never knew anybody like him; he's\nso sure of himself and he can be so cold. Sometimes I wonder if he\nreally cares about anything, deep down in his heart--anything\nexcept himself. He seems so selfish: there are times when he\nalmost makes me hate him; but just when I get to thinking I do, I\nfind I don't--he's so deliciously strong, and there's such a _big_\nluxury in being understood: I always feel he _knows_ me clear to\nthe bone, somehow! But, oh,\" she sighed regretfully, \"doesn't a\nuniform become a man? They ought to all wear 'em. It would look\nsilly on such a little goat as that Wade Trumble, though: nothing\ncould make him look like a whole man. Did you see him glaring at\nme? Beast! I was going to be so nice and kittenish and do all my\nprettiest tricks for him, to help Val with his oil company. Val\nthinks Wade would come in yet, if I'D only get him in the mood to\nhave another talk with Val about it; but the spiteful little rat\nwouldn't come near me. I believe that was one of the reasons Val\nlaughed at me and pretended not to mind my getting proposed to. He\n_must_ have minded; he couldn't have helped minding it, really.\nThat's his way; he's so _mean_--he won't show things. He knows\n_me_. I can't keep anything from him; he reads _me_ like a\nsignboard; and then about himself he keeps me guessing, and I\ncan't tell when I've guessed right. Ray Vilas behaved\ndisgustingly, of course; he was horrid and awful. I might have\nexpected it. I suppose Richard was wailing _his_ tiresome sorrows\non your poor shoulder----\"\n\n\"No,\" said Laura. \"He was very cheerful. He seemed glad you were\nhaving a good time.\"\n\n\"He didn't look particularly cheerful at me. I never saw so slow a\nman: I wonder when he's going to find out about that pendant. Val\nwould have seen it the instant I put it on. And, oh, Laura! isn't\nGeorge Wattling funny? He's just _soft_! He's good-looking\nthough,\" she continued pensively, adding, \"I promised to motor out\nto the Country Club with him to-morrow for tea.\"\n\n\"Oh, Cora,\" protested Laura, \"no! Please don't!\"\n\n\"I've promised; so I'll have to, now.\" Cora laughed. \"It'll do\nMary Kane good. Oh, I'm not going to bother much with _him_--he\nmakes me tired. I never saw anything so complacent as that girl\nwhen she came in to-night, as if her little Georgie was the\ngreatest capture the world had ever seen. . . .\"\n\nShe chattered on. Laura, passive, listened with a thoughtful\nexpression, somewhat preoccupied. The talker yawned at last.\n\n\"It must be after three,\" she said, listlessly, having gone over\nher evening so often that the colours were beginning to fade. She\nyawned again. \"Laura,\" she remarked absently, \"I don't see how you\ncan sleep in this bed; it sags so.\"\n\n\"I've never noticed it,\" said her sister. \"It's a very comfortable\nold bed.\"\n\nCora went to her to be unfastened, reverting to the lieutenant\nduring the operation, and kissing the tire-woman warmly at its\nconclusion. \"You're always so sweet to me, Laura,\" she said\naffectionately. \"I don't know how you manage it. You're so\ngood\"--she laughed--\"sometimes I wonder how you stand me. If I\nwere you, I'm positive I couldn't stand me at all!\" Another kiss\nand a hearty embrace, and she picked up her wrap and skurried\nsilently through the hall to her own room.\n\nIt was very late, but Laura wrote for almost an hour in her book\n(which was undisturbed) before she felt drowsy. Then she\nextinguished the lamp, put the book away and got into bed.\n\nIt was almost as if she had attempted to lie upon the empty air:\nthe mattress sagged under her weight as if it had been a hammock;\nand something tore with a ripping sound. There was a crash, and a\nchoked yell from a muffled voice somewhere, as the bed gave way.\nFor an instant, Laura fought wildly in an entanglement of what she\ninsufficiently perceived to be springs, slats and bedclothes with\nsomething alive squirming underneath. She cleared herself and\nsprang free, screaming, but even in her fright she remembered her\nfather and clapped her hand over her mouth that she might keep\nfrom screaming again. She dove at the door, opened it, and fled\nthrough the hall to Cora's room, still holding her hand over her\nmouth.\n\n\"Cora! Oh, Cora!\" she panted, and flung herself upon her sister's\nbed.\n\nCora was up instantly; and had lit the gas in a trice. \"There's a\nburglar!\" Laura contrived to gasp. \"In my room! Under the bed!\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"I fell on him! Something's the matter with the bed. It broke. I\nfell on him!\"\n\nCora stared at her wide-eyed. \"Why, it can't be. Think how long I\nwas in there. Your bed broke, and you just thought there was some\none there. You imagined it.\"\n\n\"No, no, no!\" wailed Laura. \"I _heard_ him: he gave a kind of\ndreadful grunt.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"_Sure_? He wriggled--oh! I could _feel_ him!\"\n\nCora seized a box of matches again. \"I'm going to find out.\" \"Oh,\nno, no!\" protested Laura, cowering.\n\n\"Yes, I am. If there's a burglar in the house I'm going to find\nhim!\"\n\n\"We mustn't wake papa.\"\n\n\"No, nor mamma either. You stay here if you want to----\"\n\n\"Let's call Hedrick,\" suggested the pallid Laura; \"or put our\nheads out of the window and scream for----\"\n\nCora laughed; she was not in the least frightened. \"That wouldn't\nwake papa, of course! If we had a telephone I'd send for the\npolice; but we haven't. I'm going to see if there's any one there.\nA burglar's a man, I guess, and I can't imagine myself being\nafraid of any _man_!\"\n\nLaura clung to her, but Cora shook her off and went through the\nhall undaunted, Laura faltering behind her. Cora lighted matches\nwith a perfectly steady hand; she hesitated on the threshold of\nLaura's room no more than a moment, then lit the lamp.\n\nLaura stifled a shriek at sight of the bed. \"Look, look!\" she\ngasped.\n\n\"There's no one under it now, that's certain,\" said Cora, and\nboldly lifted a corner of it. \"Why, it's been cut all to pieces\nfrom underneath! You're right; there was some one here. It's\npractically dismembered. Don't you remember my telling you how it\nsagged? And I was only sitting on the edge of it! The slats have\nall been moved out of place, and as for the mattress, it's just a\nmess of springs and that stuffing stuff. He must have thought the\nsilver was hidden there.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh, oh!\" moaned Laura. \"He _wriggled_----ugh!\"\n\nCora picked up the lamp. \"Well, we've got to go over the\nhouse----\"\n\n\"No, no!\"\n\n\"Hush! I'll go alone then.\"\n\n\"You _can't_.\"\n\n\"I will, though!\"\n\nThe two girls had changed places in this emergency. In her fright\nLaura was dependent, clinging: actual contact with the intruder\nhad unnerved her. It took all her will to accompany her sister\nupon the tour of inspection, and throughout she cowered behind the\ndauntless Cora. It was the first time in their lives that their\npositions had been reversed. From the days of Cora's babyhood,\nLaura had formed the habit of petting and shielding the little\nsister, but now that the possibility became imminent of\nconfronting an unknown and dangerous man, Laura was so shaken\nthat, overcome by fear, she let Cora go first. Cora had not\nboasted in vain of her bravery; in truth, she was not afraid of\nany man.\n\nThey found the fastenings of the doors secure and likewise those\nof all the windows, until they came to the kitchen. There, the\ncook had left a window up, which plausibly explained the\nmarauder's mode of ingress. Then, at Cora's insistence, and to\nLaura's shivering horror, they searched both cellar and garret,\nand concluded that he had escaped by the same means. Except\nLaura's bed, nothing in the house had been disturbed; but this\neccentricity on the part of a burglar, though it indeed struck the\ntwo girls as peculiar, was not so pointedly mysterious to them as\nit might have been had they possessed a somewhat greater\nfamiliarity with the habits of criminals whose crimes are\nprofessional.\n\nThey finally retired, Laura sleeping with her sister, and Cora had\nbegun to talk of the lieutenant again, instead of the burglar,\nbefore Laura fell asleep.\n\nIn spite of the short hours for sleep, both girls appeared at the\nbreakfast-table before the meal was over, and were naturally\npleased with the staccato of excitement evoked by their news. Mrs.\nMadison and Miss Peirce were warm in admiration of their bravery,\nbut in the same breath condemned it as foolhardy.\n\n\"I never knew such wonderful girls!\" exclaimed the mother, almost\ntearfully. \"You crazy little lions! To think of your not even\nwaking Hedrick! And you didn't have even a poker and were in your\nbare feet--and went down in the _cellar_----\"\n\n\"It was all Cora,\" protested Laura. \"I'm a hopeless, disgusting\ncoward. I never knew what a coward I was before. Cora carried the\nlamp and went ahead like a drum-major. I just trailed along behind\nher, ready to shriek and run--or faint!\"\n\n\"Could you tell anything about him when you fell on him?\" inquired\nMiss Peirce. \"What was his voice like when he shouted?\"\n\n\"Choked. It was a horrible, jolted kind of cry. It hardly sounded\nhuman.\"\n\n\"Could you tell anything about whether he was a large man, or\nsmall, or----\"\n\n\"Only that he seemed very active. He seemed to be kicking. He\n_wriggled_----ugh!\"\n\nThey evolved a plausible theory of the burglar's motives and line\nof reasoning. \"You see,\" said Miss Peirce, much stirred, in\nsumming up the adventure, \"he either jimmies the window, or finds\nit open already, and Sarah's mistaken and she _did_ leave it open!\nThen he searched the downstairs first, and didn't find anything.\nThen he came upstairs, and was afraid to come into any of the\nrooms where we were. He could tell which rooms had people in them\nby hearing us breathing through the keyholes. He finds two rooms\nempty, and probably he made a thorough search of Miss Cora's\nfirst. But he isn't after silver toilet articles and pretty little\nthings like that. He wants really big booty or none, so he decides\nthat an out-of-the-way, unimportant room like Miss Laura's is\nwhere the family would be most apt to hide valuables, jewellery\nand silver, and he knows that mattresses have often been selected\nas hiding-places; so he gets under the bed and goes to work. Then\nMiss Cora and Miss Laura come in so quietly--not wanting to wake\nanybody--that he doesn't hear them, and he gets caught there.\nThat's the way it must have been.\"\n\n\"But why,\" Mrs. Madison inquired of this authority, \"why do you\nsuppose he lit the lamp?\"\n\n\"To see by,\" answered the ready Miss Peirce. It was accepted as\nfinal.\n\nFurther discussion was temporarily interrupted by the discovery\nthat Hedrick had fallen asleep in his chair.\n\n\"Don't bother him, Cora,\" said his mother. \"He's finished\neating--let him sleep a few minutes, if he wants to, before he\ngoes to school. He's not at all well. He played too hard,\nyesterday afternoon, and hurt his knee, he said. He came down\nlimping this morning and looking very badly. He oughtn't to run\nand climb about the stable so much after school. See how utterly\nexhausted he looks!--Not even this excitement can keep him awake.\"\n\n\"I think we must be careful not to let Mr. Madison suspect\nanything about the burglar,\" said Miss Peirce. \"It would be bad\nfor him.\"\n\nLaura began: \"But we ought to notify the police----\"\n\n\"Police!\" Hedrick woke so abruptly, and uttered the word with such\npassionate and vehement protest, that everybody started. \"I\nsuppose you want to _kill_ your father, Laura Madison!\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Do you suppose he wouldn't know something had happened with a\nsquad of big, heavy policemen tromping all over the house? The\nfirst thing they'd do would be to search the whole place----\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Mrs. Madison quickly. \"It wouldn't do at all.\"\n\n\"I should think not! I'm glad,\" continued Hedrick, truthfully,\n\"_that_ idea's out of your head! I believe Laura imagined the\nwhole thing anyway.\"\n\n\"Have you looked at her mattress,\" inquired Cora, \"darling little\nboy?\"\n\nHe gave her a concentrated look, and rose to leave. \"Nothin' on\nearth but imagina----\" He stopped with a grunt as he forgetfully\nput his weight on his left leg. He rubbed his knee, swallowed\npainfully, and, leaving the word unfinished, limped haughtily from\nthe room.\n\nHe left the house, gloomily swinging his books from a spare length\nof strap, and walking with care to ease his strains and bruises as\nmuch as possible. He was very low in his mind, that boy. His\nfortunes had reached the ebb-tide, but he had no hope of a rise.\nHe had no hope of anything. It was not even a consolation that,\nthrough his talent for surprise in waylayings, it had lately been\nthought necessary, by the Villard family, to have Egerton\naccompanied to and from school by a man-servant. Nor was Hedrick\nmore deeply depressed by the certainty that both public and\ndomestic scandal must soon arise from the inevitable revelation of\nhis discontinuing his attendance at school without mentioning this\nimportant change of career at home. He had been truant a full\nfortnight, under brighter circumstances a matter for a lawless\npride--now he had neither fear nor vainglory. There was no room in\nhim for anything but dejection.\n\nHe walked two blocks in the direction of his school; turned a\ncorner; walked half a block; turned north in the alley which ran\nparallel to Corliss Street, and a few moments later had cautiously\nclimbed into an old, disused refuse box which stood against the\nrear wall of the empty stable at his own home. He pried up some\nloose boards at the bottom of the box, and entered a tunnel which\nhad often and often served in happier days--when he had\nfriends--for the escape of Union officers from Libby Prison and\nAndersonville. Emerging, wholly soiled, into a box-stall, he\ncrossed the musty carriage house and ascended some rickety steps\nto a long vacant coachman's-room, next to the hayloft. He closed\nthe door, bolted it, and sank moodily upon a broken, old horsehair\nsofa.\n\nThis apartment was his studio. In addition to the sofa, it\ncontained an ex-bureau, three chair-like shapes, a once\nmarble-topped table, now covered with a sheet of zinc, two empty\nbird cages, and a condemned whatnot. The walls were rather\nover-decorated in coloured chalks, the man-headed-snake motive\npredominating; they were also loopholed for firing into the\nhayloft. Upon the table lay a battered spy-glass, minus lenses,\nand, nearby, two boxes, one containing dried corn-silk, the other\nhayseed, convenient for the making of amateur cigarettes; the\nsmoker's outfit being completed by a neat pile of rectangular\nclippings from newspapers. On the shelves of the whatnot were some\nfragments of a dead pie, the relics of a \"Fifteen-Puzzle,\" a pink\nEaster-egg, four seashells, a tambourine with part of a girl's\nface still visible in aged colours, about two thirds of a\nhot-water bag, a tintype of Hedrick, and a number of books:\nseveral by Henty, \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,\" \"100\nPractical Jokes, Easy to Perform,\" \"The Jungle Book,\" \"My Lady\nRotha,\" a \"Family Atlas,\" \"Three Weeks,\" \"Pilgrim's Progress,\" \"A\nBoy's Life in Camp,\" and \"The Mystery of the Count's Bedroom.\"\n\nThe gloomy eye of Hedrick wandered to \"The Mystery of the Count's\nBedroom,\" and remained fixed upon it moodily and contemptuously.\nHis own mystery made that one seem tame and easy: Laura's bedroom\nlaid it all over the Count's, in his conviction; and with a soul\ntoo weary of pain to shudder, he reviewed the bafflements and\nfinal catastrophe of the preceding night.\n\nHe had not essayed the attempt upon the mattress until assured\nthat the house was wrapped in slumber. Then, with hope in his\nheart, he had stolen to Laura's room, lit the lamp, feeling safe\nfrom intrusion, and set to work. His implement at first was a long\nhatpin of Cora's. Lying on his back beneath the bed, and, moving\nthe slats as it became necessary, he sounded every cubic inch of\nthe mysterious mattress without encountering any obstruction which\ncould reasonably be supposed to be the ledger. This was not more\npuzzling than it was infuriating, since by all processes of\ninduction, deduction, and pure logic, the thing was necessarily\nthere. It was nowhere else. Therefore it was there. It _had_ to be\nthere! With the great blade of his Boy Scout's knife he began to\ndisembowel the mattress.\n\nFor a time he had worked furiously and effectively, but the\nposition was awkward, the search laborious, and he was obliged to\nrest frequently. Besides, he had waited to a later hour than he\nknew, for his mother to go to bed, and during one of his rests he\nincautiously permitted his eyes to close. When he woke, his\nsisters were in the room, and he thought it advisable to remain\nwhere he was, though he little realized how he had weakened his\nshelter. When Cora left the room, he heard Laura open the window,\nsigh, and presently a tiny clinking and a click set him a-tingle\nfrom head to foot: she was opening the padlocked book. The\nscratching sound of a pen followed. And yet she had not come near\nthe bed. The mattress, then, was a living lie.\n\nWith infinite caution he had moved so that he could see her,\narriving at a coign of vantage just as she closed the book. She\nlocked it, wrapped it in an oilskin cover which lay beside it on\nthe table, hung the key-chain round her neck, rose, yawned, and,\nto his violent chagrin, put out the light. He heard her moving but\ncould not tell where, except that it was not in his part of the\nroom. Then a faint shuffling warned him that she was approaching\nthe bed, and he withdrew his head to avoid being stepped upon. The\nnext moment the world seemed to cave in upon him.\n\nLaura's flight had given him opportunity to escape to his own room\nunobserved; there to examine, bathe and bind his wounds, and to\nrectify his first hasty impression that he had been fatally\nmangled.\n\nHedrick glared at \"The Mystery of the Count's Bedroom.\"\n\nBy and by he got up, brought the book to the sofa and began to\nread it over.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n\nThe influence of a familiar and sequestered place is not only\nsoothing; the bruised mind may often find it restorative. Thus\nHedrick, in his studio, surrounded by his own loved bric-a-brac,\nbegan to feel once more the stir of impulse. Two hours' reading\ninspired him. What a French reporter (in the Count's bedroom)\ncould do, an American youth in full possession of his\npowers--except for a strained knee and other injuries--could do.\nYes, and would!\n\nHe evolved a new chain of reasoning. The ledger had been seen in\nLaura's room; it had been heard in her room; it appeared to be\nkept in her room. But it was in no single part of the room. All\nthe parts make a whole. Therefore, the book was not in the room.\n\nOn the other hand, Laura had not left the room when she took the\nbook from its hiding-place. This was confusing; therefore he\ndetermined to concentrate logic solely upon what she had done with\nthe ledger when she finished writing in it. It was dangerous to\nassume that she had restored it to the place whence she obtained\nit, because he had already proved that place to be both in the\nroom and out of the room. No; the question he must keep in was:\nWhat did she do with it?\n\nLaura had not left the room. But the book had left the room.\n\nArrived at this inevitable deduction, he sprang to his feet in a\nstate of repressed excitement and began to pace the floor--like a\nhound on the trail. Laura had not left the room, but the book had\nleft the room: he must keep his mind upon this point. He uttered a\nloud exclamation and struck the zinc table-top a smart blow with\nhis clenched fist.\n\nLaura had thrown the book out of the window!\n\nIn the exaltation of this triumph, he forgot that it was not yet\nthe hour for a scholar's reappearance, and went forth in haste to\nsearch the ground beneath the window--a disappointing quest, for\nnowhere in the yard was there anything but withered grass, and the\nrubbish of other frost-bitten vegetation. His mother, however,\ndiscovered something else, and, opening the kitchen window, she\nasked, with surprise:\n\n\"Why, Hedrick, what on earth are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Me?\" inquired Hedrick.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Here?\" Evidently she puzzled him.\n\nShe became emphatic. \"I want to know what you are doing.\"\n\n\"Just standing here,\" he explained in a meek, grieved way.\n\n\"But why aren't you at school?\"\n\nThis recalled what he had forgotten, and he realized the\ninsecurity of his position. \"Oh, yes,\" he said--\"school. Did you\nask me----\"\n\n\"Didn't you go to school?\"\n\nHe began to speak rapidly. \"Didn't I go to _school_? Well, where\nelse could I go? Just because I'm here now doesn't mean I didn't\n_go_, does it? Because a person is in China right now wouldn't\nhave to mean he'd never been in South America, would it?\"\n\n\"Then what's the matter?\"\n\n\"Well, I was going along, and you know I didn't feel very well\nand----\" He paused, with the advent of a happier idea, then\ncontinued briskly: \"But that didn't stop me, because I thought I\nought to go if I dropped, so I went ahead, but the teacher was\nsick and they couldn't get a substitute. She must have been pretty\nsick, she looked so pale----\"\n\n\"They dismissed the class?\"\n\n\"And I don't have to go to-morrow either.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said his mother. \"But if you feel ill, Hedrick, hadn't\nyou better come in and lie down?\"\n\n\"I think it's kind of passing off. The fresh air seems to be doing\nme good.\"\n\n\"Be careful of your sore knee, dear.\" She closed the window, and\nhe was left to continue his operations in safety.\n\nLaura had thrown the ledger out of the window; that was proved\nabsolutely. Obviously, she had come down before daylight and\nretrieved it. Or, she had not. Proceeding on the assumption that\nshe had not, he lifted his eyes and searched the air. Was it\npossible that the book, though thrown from the window, had never\nreached the ground? The branches of an old and stalwart maple, now\nalmost divested of leaves, extended in rough symmetry above him,\nand one big limb, reaching out toward the house, came close to\nLaura's windows. Triumph shown again from the shrewd countenance\nof the sleuth: Laura must have slid the ledger along a wire into a\nhollow branch. However, no wire was to be seen--and the shrewd\ncountenance of the sleuth fell. But perhaps she had constructed a\ndevice of silk threads, invisible from below, which carried the\nbook into the tree. Action!\n\nHe climbed carefully but with many twinges, finally pausing in a\nparlous situation not far from the mysterious window which Laura\nhad opened the night before. A comprehensive survey of the tree\nrevealed only the very patent fact that none of the branches was\nof sufficient diameter to conceal the ledger. No silk threads came\nfrom the window. He looked and looked and looked at that window;\nthen his eye fell a little, halted less than three feet below the\nwindow-ledge, and the search was ended.\n\nThe kitchen window which his mother had opened was directly\nbeneath Laura's, and was a very long, narrow window, in the style\nof the house, and there was a protecting stone ledge above it.\nUpon this ledge lay the book, wrapped in its oil-skin covering and\nsecured from falling by a piece of broken iron hooping, stuck in\nthe mortar of the bricks. It could be seen from nowhere save an\nupper window of the house next door, or from the tree itself, and\nin either case only when the leaves had fallen.\n\nLaura had felt very safe. No one had ever seen the book except\nthat night, early in August, when, for a better circulation of\nair, she had left her door open as she wrote, and Hedrick had come\nupon her. He had not spoken of it again; she perceived that he had\nforgotten it; and she herself forgot that the memory of a boy is\nnever to be depended on; its forgettings are too seldom permanent\nin the case of things that ought to stay forgotten.\n\nTo get the book one had only to lean from the window.\n\n    *       *       *\n\nHedrick seemed so ill during lunch that his mother spoke of asking\nDoctor Sloane to look at him, if he did not improve before\nevening. Hedrick said meekly that perhaps that would be best--if\nhe did not improve. After a futile attempt to eat, he courteously\nexcused himself from the table--a ceremony which made even Cora\nfear that his case might be serious--and, going feebly to the\nlibrary, stretched himself upon the sofa. His mother put a rug\nover him; Hedrick, thanking her touchingly, closed his eyes; and\nshe went away, leaving him to slumber.\n\nAfter a time, Laura came into the room on an errand, walking\nnoiselessly, and, noticing that his eyes were open, apologized for\nwaking him.\n\n\"Never mind,\" he returned, in the tone of an invalid. \"I didn't\nsleep sound. I think there's something the matter inside my head:\nI have such terrible dreams. I guess maybe it's better for me to\nkeep awake. I'm kind of afraid to go to sleep. Would you mind\nstaying here with me a little while?\"\n\n\"Certainly I'll stay,\" she said, and, observing that his cheeks\nwere flushed, and his eyes unusually bright, she laid a cool hand\non his forehead. \"You haven't any fever, dear; that's good. You'll\nbe all right to-morrow. Would you like me to read to you?\"\n\n\"I believe,\" he answered, plaintively, \"reading might kind of\ndisturb my mind: my brain feels so sort of restless and queer. I'd\nrather play some kind of game.\"\n\n\"Cards?\"\n\n\"No, not cards exactly. Something' I can do lying down. Oh, I\nknow! You remember the one where we drew pictures and the others\nhad to guess what they were? Well, I've invented a game like that.\nYou sit down at the desk over there and take some sheets of paper.\nI'll tell you the rest.\"\n\nShe obeyed. \"What next?\"\n\n\"Now, I'll describe some people and where they live and not tell\nwho they are, and you see if you can guess their names and\naddresses.\"\n\n\"Addresses, too?\"\n\n\"Yes, because I'm going to describe the way their houses look.\nWrite each name on a separate sheet of paper, and the number of\ntheir house below it if you know it, and if you don't know it,\njust the street. If it's a woman: put `Miss' or `Mrs.' before\ntheir name and if it's a man write `Esquire' after it.\"\n\n\"Is all that necessary for the game?\"\n\n\"It's the way I invented it and I think you might----\"\n\n\"Oh, all right,\" she acquiesced, good-naturedly. \"It shall be\naccording to your rules.\"\n\n\"Then afterward, you give me the sheets of paper with the names\nand addresses written on 'em, and we--we----\" He hesitated.\n\n\"Yes. What do we do then?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you when we come to it.\" But when that stage of his\ninvention was reached, and Laura had placed the inscribed sheets\nin his hand, his interest had waned, it appeared. Also, his\ncondition had improved.\n\n\"Let's quit. I thought this game would be more exciting,\" he said,\nsitting up. \"I guess,\" he added with too much modesty, \"I'm not\nvery good at inventing games. I b'lieve I'll go out to the barn; I\nthink the fresh air----\"\n\n\"Do you feel well enough to go out?\" she asked. \"You do seem to be\nall right, though.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm a lot better, I think.\" He limped to the door. \"The\nfresh air will be the best thing for me.\"\n\nShe did not notice that he carelessly retained her contributions\nto the game, and he reached his studio with them in his hand.\nHedrick had entered the 'teens and he was a reader: things in his\nhead might have dismayed a Borgia.\n\nNo remotest glimpse entered that head of the enormity of what he\ndid. To put an end to his punishing of Cora, and, to render him\npowerless against that habitual and natural enemy, Laura had\nrevealed a horrible incident in his career--it had become a public\nscandal; he was the sport of fools; and it might be months before\nthe thing was lived down. Now he had the means, as he believed, to\neven the score with both sisters at a stroke. To him it was\nturning a tremendous and properly scathing joke upon them. He did\nnot hesitate.\n\n    *       *       *\n\nThat evening, as Richard Lindley sat at dinner with his mother,\nJoe Varden temporarily abandoned his attendance at the table to\nanswer the front doorbell. Upon his return, he remarked:\n\n\"Messenger-boy mus' been in big hurry. Wouldn' wait till I git to\ndoor.\"\n\n\"What was it?\" asked Richard.\n\n\"Boy with package. Least, I reckon it were a boy. Call' back from\nthe front walk, say he couldn' wait. Say he lef' package in\nvestibule.\"\n\n\"What sort of a package?\"\n\n\"Middle-size kind o' big package.\"\n\n\"Why don't you see what it is, Richard?\" Mrs. Lindley asked of her\nson. \"Bring it to the table, Joe.\"\n\nWhen it was brought, Richard looked at the superscription with\nsurprise. The wrapper was of heavy brown paper, and upon it a\nsheet of white notepaper had been pasted, with the address:\n\n      \"Richard Lindley, Esq.,\n      1218 Corliss Street.\"\n\n\"It's from Laura Madison,\" he said, staring at this writing.\n\"What in the world would Laura be sending me?\"\n\n\"You might possibly learn by opening it,\" suggested his mother.\n\"I've seen men puzzle over the outside of things quite as often as\nwomen. Laura Madison is a nice girl.\" She never volunteered\nsimilar praise of Laura Madison's sister. Mrs. Lindley had\nsubmitted to her son's plans concerning Cora, lately confided; but\nher submission lacked resignation.\n\n\"It's a book,\" said Richard, even more puzzled, as he took the\nledger from its wrappings. \"Two little torn places at the edge of\nthe covers. Looks as if it had once had clasps----\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's the Madison family album,\" Mrs. Lindley suggested.\n\"Pictures of Cora since infancy. I imagine she's had plenty\ntaken.\"\n\n\"No.\" He opened the book and glanced at the pages covered in\nLaura's clear, readable hand. \"No, it's about half full of\nwriting. Laura must have turned literary.\" He read a line or two,\nfrowning mildly. \"My soul! I believe it's a novel! She must think\nI'm a critic--to want me to read it.\" Smiling at the idea, he\nclosed the ledger. \"I'll take it upstairs to my hang-out after\ndinner, and see if Laura's literary manner has my august approval.\nWho in the world would ever have thought she'd decide to set up\nfor a writer?\"\n\n\"I imagine she might have something to write worth reading,\" said\nhis mother. \"I've always thought she was an interesting-looking\ngirl.\"\n\n\"Yes, she is. She dances well, too.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" continued Mrs. Lindley, thoughtfully, \"she seldom\n_says_ anything interesting, but that may be because she so seldom\nhas a chance to say anything at all.\"\n\nRichard refused to perceive this allusion. \"Curious that Laura\nshould have sent it to me,\" he said. \"She's never seemed\ninterested in my opinion about anything. I don't recall her ever\nspeaking to me on any subject whatever--except one.\"\n\nHe returned his attention to his plate, but his mother did not\nappear to agree with him that the topic was exhausted.\n\n\"`Except one'?\" she repeated, after waiting for some time.\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, in his habitual preoccupied and casual tone.\n\"Or perhaps two. Not more than two, I should say--and in a way\nyou'd call that only one, of course. Bread, Joe.\"\n\n\"What two, Richard?\"\n\n\"Cora,\" he said, with gentle simplicity, \"and me.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n\nMrs. Lindley had arranged for her son a small apartment on the\nsecond floor, and it was in his own library and smoking-room that\nRichard, comfortable in a leather-chair by a reading-lamp, after\ndinner, opened Laura's ledger.\n\nThe first page displayed no more than a date now eighteen months\npast, and the line:\n\n      \"Love came to me to-day.\"\n\nThe next page was dated the next day, and, beneath, he read:\n\n\n\"That was all I _could_ write, yesterday. I think I was too\nexcited to write. Something seemed to be singing in my breast. I\ncouldn't think in sentences--not even in words. How queer it is\nthat I had decided to keep a diary, and bound this book for it,\nand now the first thing I have written in it was _that_! It will\nnot be a diary. It shall be _your_ book. I shall keep it sacred to\nYou and write to You in it. How strange it will be if the day ever\ncomes when I shall show it to You! If it should, you would not\nlaugh at it, for of course the day couldn't come unless you\nunderstood. I cannot think it will ever come--that day! But\nmaybe---- No, I mustn't let myself hope too much that it will,\nbecause if I got to hoping too much, and you didn't like me, it\nwould hurt too much. People who expect nothing are never\ndisappointed--I must keep that in mind. Yet _every_ girl has a\n_right_ to hope for her own man to come for her some time, hasn't\nshe? It's not easy to discipline the wanting to hope--since\n_yesterday_!\n\n\"I think I must always have thought a great deal about you without\nknowing it. We really know so little what we think: our minds are\ngoing on all the time and we hardly notice them. It is like a\nqueer sort of factory--the owner only looks in once in a while and\nmost of the time hasn't any idea what sort of goods his spindles\nare turning out.\n\n\"I saw You yesterday! It seems to me the strangest thing in the\nworld. I've seen you by chance, probably two or three times a\nmonth nearly all my life, though you so seldom come here to call.\nAnd this time wasn't different from dozens of other times--you\nwere just standing on the corner by the Richfield, waiting for a\ncar. The only possible difference is that you had been out of town\nfor several months--Cora said so this morning--and how ridiculous\nit seems now, didn't even know it! I hadn't noticed it--not with\nthe top part of my mind, but perhaps the deep part that does the\nreal thinking had noticed it and had mourned your absence and was\nso glad to see you again that it made the top part suddenly see\nthe wonderful truth!\"\n\n\nLindley set down the ledger to relight his cigar. It struck him\nthat Laura had been writing \"very odd Stuff,\" but interesting; and\ncertainly it was not a story. Vaguely he recalled Marie\nBashkirtseff: hadn't she done something like this? He resumed the\nreading:\n\n\n\"You turned and spoke to me in that lovely, cordial, absent-minded\nway of yours--though I'd never thought (with the top part) what a\nlovely way it was; and for a moment I only noticed how nice you\nlooked in a light gray suit, because I'd only seen you in black\nfor so long, while you'd been in mourning for your brother.\"\n\n\nRichard, disturbed by an incredible idea, read these last\nwords over and then dismissed the notion as nonsense.\n\n\n\". . . While you'd been in mourning for your brother--and it\nstruck me that light gray was becoming to you. Then such a queer\nthing happened: I felt the great kindness of your eyes. I thought\nthey were full of--the only word that seems to express it at all\nis _charity_--and they had a sweet, faraway look, too, and I've\n_always_ thought that a look of wistful kindness was the loveliest\nlook in the world--and you had it, and I saw it and then suddenly,\nas you held your hat in your hand, the sunshine on your hair\nseemed brighter than any sunshine I had ever seen--and I began to\ntremble all over. I didn't understand what was the matter with me\nor what had made me afraid with you not of you--all at once, but I\nwas so hopelessly rattled that instead of waiting for the car, as\nI'd just told you I meant to, I said I'd decided to walk, and got\naway--without any breath left to breathe with! I _couldn't_ have\ngotten on the car with you--- and I couldn't have spoken another\nword.\n\n\"And as I walked home, trembling all the way, I saw that strange,\ndazzling sunshine on your hair, and the wistful, kind look in your\neyes--you seemed not to have taken the car but to have come with\nme--and I was uplifted and exalted oh, so strangely--oh, how the\nworld was changing for me! And when I got near home, I began to\nwalk faster, and on the front path I broke into a run and rushed\nin the house to the piano--and it was as if my fingers were\nthirsty for the keys! Then I saw that I was playing to you and\nknew that I loved you.\n\n\"I love you!\n\n\"How different everything is now from everything before. Music\nmeans what it never did: Life has leaped into blossom for me.\nEverywhere there is colour and radiance that I had never seen--the\nair is full of perfume. Dear, the sunshine that fell upon your\nhead has spread over the world!\n\n\"I understand, as I never understood, that the world--so dazzling\nto me now--was made for love and is meaningless without it. The\nyears until yesterday are gray--no, not gray, because that was the\ncolour You were wearing--not gray, because that is a beautiful\ncolour. The empty years until yesterday had no colour at all. Yes,\nthe world has meaning only through loving, and without meaning\nthere is no real life. We live only by loving, and now that this\ngift of life has come to me I love _all_ the world. I feel that I\nmust be so kind, kind, _kind_ to _everybody_! Such an odd thing\nstruck me as my greatest wish. When I was little, I remember\ngrandmother telling me how, when she was a child in pioneer days,\nthe women made the men's clothes--homespun--and how a handsome\nyoung Circuit Rider, who was a bachelor, seemed to her the most\nbeautifully dressed man she had ever seen. The women of the\ndifferent churches made his clothes, as they did their husbands'\nand brothers.' you see--only better! It came into my head that\nthat would be the divinest happiness that I could know--to sew for\nyou! If you and I lived in those old, old times--you _look_ as if\nyou belonged to them, you know, dear--and You were the young\nminister riding into the settlement on a big bay horse--and all\nthe girls at the window, of course!--and I sewing away at the\nhomespun for you!--I think all the angels of heaven would be\nchoiring in my heart--and what thick, warm clothes I'd make you\nfor winter! Perhaps in heaven they'll let some of the women sew\nfor the men they love--I wonder!\n\n\"I hear Cora's voice from downstairs as I write. She's often so\nangry with Ray, poor girl. It does not seem to me that she and Ray\nreally belong to each other, though they _say_ so often that they\ndo.\"\n\n\nRichard having read thus far with a growing, vague uneasiness,\nlooked up, frowning. He hoped Laura had no Marie Bashkirtseff idea\nof publishing this manuscript. It was too intimate, he thought,\neven if the names in it were to be disguised.\n\n. . . \"Though they _say_ so often that they do. I think Ray is in\nlove with _her_, but it can't be like _this_. What he feels must\nbe something wholly different--there is violence and wildness in\nit. And they are bitter with each other so often-- always `getting\neven' for something. He does care--he is frantically `_in_ love'\nwith her, undoubtedly, but so insanely jealous. I suppose all\njealousy is insane. But love is the only sanity. How can what is\ninsane be part of it? I could not be jealous of You. I owe life to\nyou--I have never lived till now.\"\n\n\nThe next writing was two days later:\n\n\n. . . . \"To-day as I passed your house with Cora, I kept looking\nat the big front door at which you go in and out so often--_your_\ndoor! I never knew that just a door could look so beautiful! And\nunconsciously I kept my eyes on it, as we walked on, turning my\nhead and looking and looking back at it, till Cora suddenly burst\nout laughing, and said: `Well, _Laura_!' And I came to myself--and\nfound her looking at me. It was like getting back after a journey,\nand for a second I was a little dazed, and Cora kept on laughing\nat me, and I felt myself getting red. I made some silly excuse\nabout thinking your house had been repainted--and she laughed\nlouder than ever. I was afraid then that she understood--I wonder\nif she could have? I hope not, though I love her so much I don't\nknow why I would rather she didn't know, unless it is just my\n_feeling_ about it. It is a _guardian_ feeling--that I must keep\nfor myself, the music of these angels singing in my heart--singing\nof You. I hope she did not understand--and I so fear she did. Why\nshould I be so _afraid_?\" . . .\n\n. . . . \"Two days since I have talked to You in your book after\nCora caught me staring at your door and laughed at me--and ten\nminutes ago I was sitting beside the _actual_ You on the porch! I\nam trembling yet. It was the first time you'd come for months and\nmonths; and yet you had the air of thinking it rather a pleasant\nthing to do as you came up the steps! And a dizzy feeling came\nover me, because I wondered if it was seeing me on the street\n_that_ day that put it into your head to come. It seemed too much\nhappiness--and risking too much--to let myself _believe_ it, but I\ncouldn't help just wondering. I began to tremble as I saw you\ncoming up our side of the street in the moonlight--and when you\nturned in here I was all panic--I nearly ran into the house. I\ndon't know how I found voice to greet you. I didn't seem to have\nany breath left at all. I was so relieved when Cora took a chair\nbetween us and began to talk to you, because I'm sure I couldn't\nhave. She and poor Ray had been having one of their quarrels and\nshe was punishing him. Poor boy, he seemed so miserable--though he\ntried to talk to me--about politics, I think, though I'm not sure,\nbecause I couldn't listen much better than either of us could\ntalk. I could only hear Your voice--such a rich, quiet voice, and\nit has a sound like the look you have--friendly and faraway and\nwistful. I have thought and thought about what it is that makes\nyou look wistful. You have less to wish for than anybody else in\nthe world because you have Yourself. So why are you wistful? I\nthink it's just because you _are_!\n\n\"I heard Cora asking you why you hadn't come to see us for so\nlong, and then she said: `Is it because you dislike me? You look\nat me, sometimes, as if you dislike me!' And I wished she hadn't\nsaid it. I had a feeling you wouldn't like that `personal' way of\ntalking that she enjoys--and that--oh, it didn't seem to be in\nkeeping with the dignity of You! And I love Cora so much I wanted\nher to be finer--with You. I wanted her to understand you better\nthan to play those little charming tricks at you. You are so good,\nso _high_, that if she could make a real friend of you I think it\nwould be the best thing for her that could happen. She's never had\na man-_friend_. Perhaps she _was_ trying to make one of you and\nhasn't any other way to go about it. She can be so _really_ sweet,\nI wanted you to see that side of her.\n\n\"Afterwhile, when Ray couldn't bear it any longer to talk to me,\nand in his desperation brazenly took Cora to the other end of the\nporch almost by force, and I was left, in a way, alone with you\nwhat did you think of me? I was tongue-tied! Oh, oh, oh! You were\nquiet--but _I_ was _dumb_! My heart wasn't dumb--it hammered! All\nthe time I kept saying to myself such a jumble of things. And into\nthe jumble would come such a rapture that You were there--it was\nlike a paean of happiness--a chanting of the glory of having You\nnear me--I _was_ mixed up! I could _play_ all those confused\nthings, but writing them doesn't tell it. Writing them would only\nbe like this: `He's here, he's _here_! Speak, you little fool!\nHe's here, he's here! He's sitting beside you! _speak_, idiot, or\nhe'll never come back! He's here, he's beside you you could put\nout your hand and touch him! Are you dead, that you can't speak?\nHe's here, he's here, he's _here_!'\n\n\"Ah, some day I shall be able to talk to you--but not till I get\nmore used to this inner song. It seems to _will_ that nothing else\nshall come from my lips till _it_ does!\n\n\"In spite of my silence--my outward woodenness--you said, as you\nwent away, that you would come again! You said `soon'! I could\nonly nod but Cora called from the other end of the porch and\nasked: `_How_ soon?' Oh, I bless her for it, because you said,\n`Day after to-morrow.' Day after tomorrow! Day after to-morrow!\n_Day after tomorrow_!\n\n. . . . \"Twenty-one hours since I wrote--no, _sang_--`Day after\nto-morrow!' And now it is `To-morrow!' Oh, the slow, golden day\nthat this has been! I could not stay in the house--I walked--no, I\n_winged_! I was in the open country before I knew it--with You!\nFor You are in everything. I never knew the sky was blue, before.\nUntil now I just thought it was the sky. The whitest clouds I ever\nsaw sailed over that blue, and I stood upon the prow of each in\nturn, then leaped in and swam to the next and sailed with _it_!\nOh, the beautiful sky, and kind, green woods and blessed, long,\nwhite, dusty country road! Never in my life shall I forget that\nwalk--this day in the open with my love--You! To-morrow!\nTo-morrow! To-morrow! _To-morrow_!\"\n\n\nThe next writing in Laura's book was dated more than two months\nlater:\n\n\n. . . . \"I have decided to write again in this book. I have\nthought it all out carefully, and I have come to the conclusion\nthat it can do no harm and may help me to be steady and sensible.\nIt is the thought, not its expression, that is guilty, but I do\nnot believe that my thoughts are guilty: I believe that they are\ngood. I know that I wish only good. I have read that when people\nsuffer very much the best thing is for them to cry. And so I'll\nlet myself _write_ out my feelings--and perhaps get rid of some of\nthe silly self-pity I'm foolish enough to feel, instead of going\nabout choked up with it. How queer it is that even when we keep\nour thoughts respectable we can't help having absurd _feelings_\nlike self-pity, even though we know how rotten stupid they are!\nYes, I'll let it all out here, and then, some day, when I've cured\nmyself all whole again, I'll burn this poor, silly old book. And\nif I'm not cured before the wedding, I'll burn it then, anyhow.\n\n\"How funny little girls are! From the time they're little bits of\nthings they talk about marriage--whom they are going to marry,\nwhat sort of person it will be. I think Cora and I began when she\nwas about five and I not seven. And as girls grow up, I don't\nbelieve there was ever one who genuinely expected to be an old\nmaid. The most unattractive young girls discuss and plan and\nexpect marriage just as much as the prettier and gayer ones. The\nonly way we can find out that men don't want to marry us is by\ntheir not asking us. We don't see ourselves very well, and I\nhonestly believe we all think--way deep down--that we're pretty\nattractive. At least, every girl has the idea, sometimes, that if\nmen only saw the whole truth they'd think her as nice as any other\ngirl, and really nicer than most others. But I don't believe I\nhave any hallucinations of that sort about myself left. I can't\nimagine--now--_any_ man seeing anything in me that would make him\ncare for me. I can't see anything about me to care for, myself.\nSometimes I think maybe I could make a man get excited about me if\nI could take a startlingly personal tone with him from the\nbeginning, making him wonder all sorts of you-and-I perhapses--but\nI couldn't do it very well probably--oh, I couldn't make myself do\nit if I could do it well! And I shouldn't think it would have much\neffect except upon very inexperienced men--yet it does! Now, I\nwonder if this is a streak of sourness coming out; I don't feel\nbitter--I'm just thinking honestly, I'm sure.\n\n\"Well, here I am facing it: all through my later childhood, and\nall through my girlhood, I believe what really occupied me\nmost--with the thought of it underlying all things else, though\noften buried very deep--was the prospect of my marriage. I\nregarded it as a certainty: I would grow up, fall in love, get\nengaged, and be married--of course! So I grew up and fell in love\nwith You--but it stops there, and I must learn how to be an Old\nMaid and not let anybody see that I mind it. I know this is the\nhardest part of it, the beginning: it will get easier by-and-by,\nof course. If I can just manage this part of it, it's bound not to\nhurt so much later on.\n\n\"Yes, I grew up and fell in love with You--for you will always be\nYou. I'll never, never get over _that_, my dear! You'll never,\nnever know it; but I shall love You always till I die, and if I'm\nstill Me after that, I shall keep right on loving you then, of\ncourse. You see, I didn't fall in love with you just to have you\nfor myself. I fell in love with You! And that can never bother you\nat all nor ever be a shame to me that I love unsought, because you\nwon't know, and because it's just an ocean of good-will, and every\nbeat of my heart sends a new great wave of it toward you and Cora.\nI shall find happiness, I believe, in service--I am sure there\nwill be times when I can serve you both. I love you both and I can\nserve her for You and you for her. This isn't a hysterical mood,\nor a fit of `exaltation': I have thought it all out and I know\nthat I can live up to it. You are the best thing that can ever\ncome into her life, and everything I can do shall be to keep you\nthere. I must be very, very careful with her, for talk and advice\ndo not influence her much. You love her--she has accepted you, and\nit is beautiful for you both. It must be kept beautiful. It has\nall become so clear to me: You are just what she has always\nneeded, and if by any mischance she lost you I do not know what\nwould become----\"\n\n\n\"Good God!\" cried Richard. He sprang to his feet, and the heavy\nbook fell with a muffled crash upon the floor, sprawling open upon\nits face, its leaves in disorder. He moved away from it, staring\nat it in incredulous dismay. But he knew.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\n\nMemory, that drowsy custodian, had wakened slowly, during this\nhour, beginning the process with fitful gleams of\nsemi-consciousness, then, irritated, searching its pockets for the\nkeys and dazedly exploring blind passages; but now it flung wide\nopen the gallery doors, and there, in clear light, were the rows\nof painted canvasses.\n\nHe remembered \"that day\" when he was waiting for a car, and Laura\nMadison had stopped for a moment, and then had gone on, saying she\npreferred to walk. He remembered that after he got into the car he\nwondered why he had not walked home with her; had thought himself\n\"slow\" for not thinking of it in time to do it. There had seemed\nsomething very \"taking\" about her, as she stopped and spoke to\nhim, something enlivening and wholesome and sweet--it had struck\nhim that Laura was a \"very nice girl.\" He had never before noticed\nhow really charming she could look; in fact he had never thought\nmuch about either of the Madison sisters, who had become \"young\nladies\" during his mourning for his brother. And this pleasant\nimage of Laura remained with him for several days, until he\ndecided that it might be a delightful thing to spend an evening\nwith her. He had called, and he remembered, now, Cora's saying to\nhim that he looked at her sometimes as if he did not like her; he\nhad been surprised and astonishingly pleased to detect a\nmysterious feeling in her about it.\n\nHe remembered that almost at once he had fallen in love with Cora:\nshe captivated him, enraptured him, as she still did--as she\nalways would, he felt, no matter how she treated him or what she\ndid to him. He did not analyze the process of the captivation and\nenrapturement--for love is a mystery and cannot be analyzed. This\nis so well known that even Richard Lindley knew it, and did not\ntry!\n\n. . . Heartsick, he stared at the fallen book. He was a man, and\nhere was the proffered love of a woman he did not want. There was\na pathos in the ledger; it seemed to grovel, sprawling and\ndishevelled in the circle of lamp-light on the floor: it was as if\nLaura herself lay pleading at his feet, and he looked down upon\nher, compassionate but revolted. He realized with astonishment\nfrom what a height she had fallen, how greatly he had respected\nher, how warmly liked her. What she now destroyed had been more\nimportant than he had guessed.\n\nSimple masculine indignation rose within him: she was to have been\nhis sister. If she had been unable to stifle this misplaced love\nof hers, could she not at least have kept it to herself? Laura,\nthe self-respecting! No; she offered it--offered it to her\nsister's betrothed. She had written that he should \"never, never\nknow it\"; that when she was \"cured\" she would burn the ledger. She\nhad not burned it! There were inconsistencies in plenty in the\npitiful screed, but these were the wildest--and the cheapest. In\ntalk, she had urged him to \"keep trying,\" for Cora, and now the\nsick-minded creature sent him this record. She wanted him to know.\nThen what else was it but a plea? \"I love you. Let Cora go. Take\nme.\"\n\nHe began to walk up and down, wondering what was to be done. After\na time, he picked up the book gingerly, set it upon a shelf in a\ndark corner, and went for a walk outdoors. The night air seemed\nbetter than that of the room that held the ledger.\n\nAt the corner a boy, running, passed him. It was Hedrick Madison,\nbut Hedrick did not recognize Richard, nor was his mind at that\nmoment concerned with Richard's affairs; he was on an errand of\nhaste to Doctor Sloane. Mr. Madison had wakened from a heavy\nslumber unable to speak, his condition obviously much worse.\n\nHedrick returned in the doctor's car, and then hung uneasily about\nthe door of the sick-room until Laura came out and told him to go\nto bed. In the morning, his mother did not appear at the breakfast\ntable, Cora was serious and quiet, and Laura said that he need not\ngo to school that day, though she added that the doctor thought\ntheir father would get \"better.\" She looked wan and hollow-eyed:\nshe had not been to bed, but declared that she would rest after\nbreakfast. Evidently she had not missed her ledger; and Hedrick\nwatched her closely, a pleasurable excitement stirring in his\nbreast.\n\nShe did not go to her room after the meal; the house was cold,\npossessing no furnace, and, with Hedrick's assistance, she carried\nout the ashes from the library grate, and built a fire there. She\nhad just lighted it, and the kindling was beginning to crackle,\nglowing rosily over her tired face, when the bell rang.\n\n\"Will you see who it is, please, Hedrick?\"\n\nHe went with alacrity, and, returning, announced in an odd voice.\n\"It's Dick Lindley. He wants to see you.\"\n\n\"Me?\" she murmured, wanly surprised. She was kneeling before the\nfireplace, wearing an old dress which was dusted with ashes, and\nupon her hands a pair of worn-out gloves of her father's. Lindley\nappeared in the hall behind Hedrick, carrying under his arm\nsomething wrapped in brown paper. His expression led her to think\nthat he had heard of her father's relapse, and came on that\naccount.\n\n\"Don't look at me, Richard,\" she said, smiling faintly as she\nrose, and stripping her hands of the clumsy gloves. \"It's good of\nyou to come, though. Doctor Sloane thinks he is going to be better\nagain.\"\n\nRichard inclined his head gravely, but did not speak.\n\n\"Well,\" said Hedrick with a slight emphasis, \"I guess I'll go out\nin the yard a while.\" And with shining eyes he left the room.\n\nIn the hall, out of range from the library door, he executed a\ntriumphant but noiseless caper, and doubled with mirth, clapping\nhis hand over his mouth to stifle the effervescings of his joy. He\nhad recognized the ledger in the same wrapping in which he had\nleft it in Mrs. Lindley's vestibule. His moment had come: the\nclimax of his enormous joke, the repayment in some small measure\nfor the anguish he had so long endured. He crept silently back\ntoward the door, flattened his back against the wall, and\nlistened.\n\n\"Richard,\" he heard Laura say, a vague alarm in her voice, \"what\nis it? What is the matter?\"\n\nThen Lindley: \"I did not know what to do about it. I couldn't\nthink of any sensible thing. I suppose what I am doing is the\nstupidest of all the things I thought of, but at least it's\nhonest--so I've brought it back to you myself. Take it, please.\"\n\nThere was a crackling of the stiff wrapping paper, a little pause,\nthen a strange sound from Laura. It was not vocal and no more than\njust audible: it was a prolonged scream in a whisper.\n\nHedrick ventured an eye at the crack, between the partly open door\nand its casing. Lindley stood with his back to him, but the boy\nhad a clear view of Laura. She was leaning against the wall,\nfacing Richard, the book clutched in both arms against her bosom,\nthe wrapping paper on the floor at her feet.\n\n\"I thought of sending it back and pretending to think it had been\nleft at my mother's house by mistake,\" said Richard sadly, \"and of\ntrying to make it seem that I hadn't read any of it. I thought of\na dozen ways to pretend I believed you hadn't really meant me to\nread it----\"\n\nMaking a crucial effort, she managed to speak.\n\n\"You--think I--did mean----\"\n\n\"Well,\" he answered, with a helpless shrug, \"you sent it! But it's\nwhat's in it that really matters, isn't it? I could have pretended\nanything in a note, I suppose, if I had written instead of coming.\nBut I found that what I most dreaded was meeting you again, and as\nwe've got to meet, of course, it seemed to me the only thing to do\nwas to blunder through a talk with you, somehow or another, and\nget that part of it over. I thought the longer I put off facing\nyou, the worse it would be for both of us--and--and the more\nembarrassing. I'm no good at pretending, anyhow; and the thing has\nhappened. What use is there in not being honest? Well?\"\n\nShe did not try again to speak. Her state was lamentable: it was\nall in her eyes.\n\nRichard hung his head wretchedly, turning partly away from her.\n\"There's only one way--to look at it,\" he said hesitatingly, and\nstammering. \"That is--there's only one thing to do: to forget that\nit's happened. I'm--I--oh, well, I care for Cora altogether. She's\ngot never to know about this. She hasn't any idea or--suspicion of\nit, has she?\"\n\nLaura managed to shake her head.\n\n\"She never must have,\" he said. \"Will you promise me to burn that\nbook now?\"\n\nShe nodded slowly.\n\n\"I--I'm awfully sorry, Laura,\" he said brokenly. \"I'm not idiot\nenough not to see that you're suffering horribly. I suppose I have\ndone the most blundering thing possible.\" He stood a moment,\nirresolute, then turned to the door. \"Good-bye.\"\n\nHedrick had just time to dive into the hideous little room of the\nmultitudinous owls as Richard strode into the hall. Then, with the\nclosing of the front door, the boy was back at his post.\n\nLaura stood leaning against the wall, the book clutched in her\narms, as Richard had left her. Slowly she began to sink, her eyes\nwide open, and, with her back against the wall, she slid down\nuntil she was sitting upon the floor. Her arms relaxed and hung\nlimp at her sides, letting the book topple over in her lap, and\nshe sat motionless.\n\nOne of her feet protruded from her skirt, and the leaping\nfirelight illumined it ruddily. It was a graceful foot in an old\nshoe which had been re-soled and patched. It seemed very still,\nthat patched shoe, as if it might stay still forever. Hedrick knew\nthat Laura had not fainted, but he wished she would move her foot.\n\nHe went away. He went into the owl-room again, and stood there\nsilently a long, long time. Then he stole back again toward the\nlibrary door, but caught a glimpse of that old, motionless shoe\nthrough the doorway as he came near. Then he spied no more. He\nwent out to the stable, and, secluding himself in his studio, sat\nmoodily to meditate.\n\nSomething was the matter. Something had gone wrong. He had thrown\na bomb which he had expected to go off with a stupendous bang,\nleaving him, as the smoke cleared, looking down in merry triumph,\nstinging his fallen enemies with his humour, withering them with\nsatire, and inquiring of them how it felt, now _they_ were getting\nit. But he was decidedly untriumphant: he wished Laura had moved\nher foot and that she hadn't that patch upon her shoe. He could\nnot get his mind off that patch. He began to feel very queer: it\nseemed to be somehow because of the patch. If she had worn a pair\nof new shoes that morning. . . . Yes, it was that patch.\n\nThirteen is a dangerous age: nothing is more subtle. The boy,\ninspired to play the man, is beset by his own relapses into\nchildhood, and Hedrick was near a relapse.\n\nBy and by, he went into the house again, to the library. Laura was\nnot there, but he found the fire almost smothered under heaping\nashes. She had burned her book.\n\nHe went into the room where the piano was, and played \"The Girl on\nthe Saskatchewan\" with one finger; then went out to the porch and\nwalked up and down, whistling cheerily.\n\nAfter that, he went upstairs and asked Miss Peirce how his father\nwas \"feeling,\" receiving a noncommital reply; looked in at Cora's\nroom; saw that his mother was lying asleep on Cora's bed and Cora\nherself examining the contents of a dressing-table drawer; and\nwithdrew. A moment later, he stood in the passage outside Laura's\nclosed door listening. There was no sound.\n\nHe retired to his own chamber, found it unbearable, and,\nfascinated by Laura's, returned thither; and, after standing a\nlong time in the passage, knocked softly on the door.\n\n\"Laura,\" he called, in a rough and careless voice, \"it's kind of a\npretty day outdoors. If you've had your nap, if I was you I'd go\nout for a walk.\" There was no response. \"I'll go with you,\" he\nadded, \"if you want me to.\"\n\nHe listened again and heard nothing. Then he turned the knob\nsoftly. The door was unlocked; he opened it and went in.\n\nLaura was sitting in a chair, with her back to a window, her hands\nin her lap. She was staring straight in front of her.\n\nHe came near her hesitatingly, and at first she did not seem to\nsee him or even to know that she was not alone in the room. Then\nshe looked at him wonderingly, and, as he stood beside her, lifted\nher right hand and set it gently upon his head.\n\n\"Hedrick,\" she said, \"was it you that took my book to----\"\n\nAll at once he fell upon his knees, hid his face in her lap, and\nburst into loud and passionate sobbing.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY\n\nValentine Corliss, having breakfasted in bed at a late hour that\nmorning, dozed again, roused himself, and, making a toilet,\naddressed to the image in his shaving-mirror a disgusted\nmonosyllable.\n\n\"Ass!\"\n\nHowever, he had not the look of a man who had played cards all\nnight to a disastrous tune with an accompaniment in Scotch. His\nwas a surface not easily indented: he was hard and healthy,\nclear-skinned and clear-eyed. When he had made himself\npoint-device, he went into the \"parlour\" of his apartment,\nfrowning at the litter of malodorous, relics, stumps and stubs and\nbottles and half-drained glasses, scattered chips and cards, dregs\nof a night session. He had been making acquaintances.\n\nHe sat at the desk and wrote with a steady hand in Italian:\n\n\nMOST ILLUSTRIOUS MOLITERNO:\n\nWe live but learn little. As to myself it appears that I learn\nnothing--nothing! You will at once convey to me by _cable_ five\nthousand lire. No; add the difference in exchange so as to make it\none thousand dollars which I shall receive, taking that sum from\nthe two-hundred and thirty thousand lire which I entrusted to your\nsafekeeping by cable as the result of my enterprise in this place.\nI should have returned at once, content with that success, but as\nyou know I am a very stupid fellow, never pleased with a moderate\ntriumph, nor with a large one, when there is a possible prospect\nof greater. I am compelled to believe that the greater I had in\nmind in this case was an illusion: my gentle diplomacy avails\nnothing against a small miser--for we have misers even in these\nStates, though you will not believe it. I abandon him to his\nriches! From the success of my venture I reserved four thousand\ndollars to keep by me and for my expenses, and it is humiliating\nto relate that all of this, except a small banknote or two, was\ntaken from me last night by amateurs. I should keep away from\ncards--they hate me, and alone I can do nothing with them. Some\nyoung gentlemen of the place, whose acquaintance I had made at a\nball, did me the honour of this lesson at the native game of\npoker, at which I--though also native--am not even so expert as\nyourself, and, as you will admit, Antonio, my friend, you are not\na good player--when observed. Unaided, I was a child in their\nhands. It was also a painful rule that one paid for the counters\nupon delivery. This made me ill, but I carried it off with an air\nof carelessness creditable to an adopted Neapolitan. Upon receipt\nof the money you are to cable me, I shall leave this town and sail\nimmediately. Come to Paris, and meet me there at the place on the\nRue Auber within ten days from your reading this letter. You will\nhave, remaining, two hundred and twenty-five thousand francs,\nwhich it will be safer to bring in cash, and I will deal well with\nyou, as is our custom with each other. You have done excellently\nthroughout; your cables and letters for exhibition concerning\nthose famous oil wells have been perfection; and I shall of course\nnot deduct what was taken by these thieves of poker players from\nthe sum of profits upon which we shall estimate your commission. I\nhave several times had the feeling that the hour for departure had\narrived; now I shall delay not a moment after receiving your\ncable, though I may occupy the interim with a last attempt to\ninterest my small miser. Various circumstances cause me some\nuneasiness, though I do not believe I could be successfully\nassailed by the law in the matter of oil. You do own an estate in\nBasilicata, at least your brother does--these good people here\nwould not be apt to discover the difference--and the rest is a\nmatter of plausibility. The odious coincidence of encountering the\nold cow, Pryor, fretted me somewhat (though he has not repeated\nhis annoying call), and I have other small apprehensions--for\nexample, that it may not improve my credit if my loss of last\nnight becomes gossip, though the thieves professed strong habits\nof discretion. My little affair of gallantry grows embarrassing.\nSuch affairs are so easy to inaugurate; extrication is more\ndifficult. However, without it I should have failed to interest my\ninvestor and there is always the charm. Your last letter is too\ncurious in that matter. Licentious man, one does not write of\nthese things while under the banner of the illustrious Uncle\nSam--I am assuming the American attitude while here, or perhaps my\nearly youth returns to me--a thing very different from your own\nboyhood, Don Antonio. Nevertheless, I promise you some laughter in\nthe Rue Auber. Though you will not be able to understand the half\nof what I shall tell you--particularly the portraits I shall\nsketch of my defeated rivals--your spirit shall roll with\nlaughter.\n\nTo the bank, then, the instant you read. Cable me one thousand\ndollars, and be at the Rue Auber not more than ten days later. To\nthe bank! Thence to the telegraph office. Speed! V. C.\n\n\nHe was in better spirits as he read over this letter, and he\nchuckled as he addressed it. He pictured himself in the rear room\nof the bar in the Rue Auber, relating, across the little\nmarble-topped table, this American adventure, to the delight of\nthat blithe, ne'er-do-well outcast of an exalted poor family, that\ngambler, blackmailer and merry rogue, Don Antonio Moliterno,\ncomrade and teacher of this ductile Valentine since the later days\nof adolescence. They had been school-fellows in Rome, and later\nroamed Europe together unleashed, discovering worlds of many\nkinds. Valentine's careless mother let her boy go as he liked, and\nwas often negligent in the matter of remittances: he and his\nfriend learned ways to raise the wind, becoming expert and making\ncurious affiliations. At her death there was a small inheritance;\nshe had not been provident. The little she left went rocketing,\nand there was the wind to be raised again: young Corliss had wits\nand had found that they could supply him--most of the time--with\nmuch more than the necessities of life. He had also found that he\npossessed a strong attraction for various women; already--at\ntwenty-two--his experience was considerable, and, in his way, he\nbecame a specialist. He had a talent; he improved it and his\nopportunities. Altogether, he took to the work without malice and\nwith a light heart. . . .\n\nHe sealed the envelope, rang for a boy, gave him the letter to\npost, and directed that the apartment should be set to rights. It\nwas not that in which he had received Ray Vilas. Corliss had moved\nto rooms on another floor of the hotel, the day after that\neccentric and somewhat ominous person had called to make an\n\"investment.\" Ray's shadowy forebodings concerning that former\napartment had encountered satire: Corliss was a \"materialist\" and,\nat the mildest estimate, an unusually practical man, but he would\nnever sleep in a bed with its foot toward the door; southern Italy\nhad seeped into him. He changed his rooms, a measure of which Don\nAntonio Moliterno would have wholly approved. Besides, these were\nas comfortable as the others, and so like them as even to confirm\nRay's statement concerning \"A Reading from Homer\": evidently this\nwork had been purchased by the edition.\n\nA boy came to announce that his \"roadster\" waited for him at the\nhotel entrance, and Corliss put on a fur motoring coat and cap,\nand went downstairs. A door leading from the hotel bar into the\nlobby was open, and, as Corliss passed it, there issued a mocking\nshout:\n\n\"Tor'dor! Oh, look at the Tor'dor! Ain't he the handsome\nSpaniard!\"\n\nRay Vilas stumbled out, tousled, haggard, waving his arms in\nabsurd and meaningless gestures; an amused gallery of tipplers\nfilling the doorway behind him.\n\n\"Goin' take Carmen buggy ride in the country, ain't he? Good ole\nTor'dor!\" he quavered loudly, clutching Corliss's shoulder. \"How\nmuch you s'pose he pays f' that buzz-buggy by the day, jeli'm'n?\nNaughty Tor'dor, stole thousand dollars from me--makin'\npresents--diamond cresses. Tor'dor, I hear you been playing cards.\nTha's sn't nice. Tor'dor, you're not a goo' boy at all--_you_ know\nyou oughtn't waste Dick Lindley's money like that!\"\n\nCorliss set his open hand upon the drunkard's breast and sent him\ngyrating and plunging backward. Some one caught the grotesque\nfigure as it fell.\n\n\"Oh, my God,\" screamed Ray, \"I haven't got a gun on me! He _knows_\nI haven't got my gun with me! _Why_ haven't I got my gun with me?\"\n\nThey hustled him away, and Corliss, enraged and startled, passed\non. As he sped the car up Corliss Street, he decided to anticipate\nhis letter to Moliterno by a cable. He had stayed too long.\n\nCora looked charming in a new equipment for November motoring; yet\nit cannot be said that either of them enjoyed the drive. They\nlunched a dozen miles out from the city at an establishment\nsomewhat in the nature of a roadside inn; and, although its\ncuisine was quite unknown to Cora's friend, Mrs. Villard (an eager\namateur of the table), they were served with a meal of such\nunusual excellence that the waiter thought it a thousand pities\npatrons so distinguished should possess such poor appetites.\n\nThey returned at about three in the afternoon, and Cora descended\nfrom the car wearing no very amiable expression.\n\n\"Why won't you come in now?\" she asked, looking at him angrily.\n\"We've got to talk things out. We've settled nothing whatever. I\nwant to know why you can't stop.\"\n\n\"I've got some matters to attend to, and----\"\n\n\"What matters?\" She shot him a glance of fierce skepticism.\n\n\"Are you packing to get out?\"\n\n\"Cora!\" he cried reproachfully, \"how can you say things like that\nto _me_!\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Oh, it wouldn't surprise me in the least! How\ndo _I_ know what you'll do? For all I know, you may be just that\nkind of a man. You _said_ you ought to be going----\"\n\n\"Cora,\" he explained, gently, \"I didn't say I meant to go. I said\nonly that I thought I ought to, because Moliterno will be needing\nme in Basilicata. I ought to be there, since it appears that no\nmore money is to be raised here. I ought to be superintending\noperations in the oil-field, so as to make the best use of the\nlittle I have raised.\"\n\n\"You?\" she laughed. \"Of course _I_ didn't have anything to do with\nit!\"\n\nHe sighed deeply. \"You know perfectly well that I appreciate all\nyou did. We don't seem to get on very well to-day----\"\n\n\"No!\" She laughed again, bitterly. \"So you think you'll be going,\ndon't you?\"\n\n\"To my rooms to write some necessary letters.\"\n\n\"Of course not to pack your trunk?\"\n\n\"Cora,\" he returned, goaded; \"sometimes you're just impossible.\nI'll come to-morrow forenoon.\"\n\n\"Then don't bring the car. I'm tired of motoring and tired of\nlunching in that rotten hole. We can talk just as well in the\nlibrary. Papa's better, and that little fiend will be in school\nto-morrow. Come out about ten.\"\n\nHe started the machine. \"Don't forget I love you,\" he called in a\nlow voice.\n\nShe stood looking after him as the car dwindled down the street.\n\n\"Yes, you do!\" she murmured.\n\nShe walked up the path to the house, her face thoughtful, as with\na tiresome perplexity. In her own room, divesting herself of her\nwraps, she gave the mirror a long scrutiny. It offered the picture\nof a girl with a hard and dreary air; but Cora saw something else,\nand presently, though the dreariness remained, the hardness\nsoftened to a great compassion. She suffered: a warm wave of\nsorrow submerged her, and she threw herself upon the bed and wept\nlong and silently for herself.\n\nAt last her eyes dried, and she lay staring at the ceiling. The\ndoorbell rang, and Sarah, the cook, came to inform her that Mr.\nRichard Lindley was below.\n\n\"Tell him I'm out.\"\n\n\"Can't,\" returned Sarah. \"Done told him you was home.\" And she\ndeparted firmly.\n\nThus abandoned, the prostrate lady put into a few words what she\nfelt about Sarah, and, going to the door, whisperingly summoned in\nLaura, who was leaving the sick-room, across the hall.\n\n\"Richard is downstairs. Will you go and tell him I'm sick in\nbed--or dead? Anything to make him go.\" And, assuming Laura's\nacquiescence, Cora went on, without pause: \"Is father worse?\nWhat's the matter with you, Laura?\"\n\n\"Nothing. He's a little better, Miss Peirce thinks.\"\n\n\"You look ill.\"\n\n\"I'm all right.\"\n\n\"Then run along like a duck and get rid of that old bore for me.\"\n\n\"Cora--please see him?\"\n\n\"Not me! I've got too much to think about to bother with him.\"\n\nLaura walked to the window and stood with her back to her sister,\napparently interested in the view of Corliss Street there\npresented. \"Cora,\" she said, \"why don't you marry him and have\ndone with all this?\"\n\nCora hooted.\n\n\"Why not? Why not marry him as soon as you can get ready? Why\ndon't you go down now and tell him you will? Why not, Cora?\"\n\n\"I'd as soon marry a pail of milk--yes, tepid milk, skimmed!\nI----\"\n\n\"Don't you realize how kind he'd be to you?\"\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" said Cora moodily. \"He might object to\nsome things--but it doesn't matter, because I'm not going to try\nhim. I don't mind a man's being a fool, but I can't stand the\nabsent-minded breed of idiot. I've worn his diamond in the pendant\nright in his eyes for weeks; he's never once noticed it enough\neven to ask me about the pendant, but bores me to death wanting to\nknow why I won't wear the ring! Anyhow, what's the use talking\nabout him? He couldn't marry me right now, even if I wanted him\nto--not till he begins to get something on the investment he made\nwith Val. Outside of that, he's got nothing except his rooms at\nhis mother's; she hasn't much either; and if Richard should lose\nwhat he put in with Val, he couldn't marry for years, probably.\nThat's what made him so obstinate about it. No; if I ever marry\nright off the reel it's got to be somebody with----\"\n\n\"Cora\"--Laura still spoke from the window, not turning--\"aren't\nyou tired of it all, of this getting so upset about one man and\nthen another and----\"\n\n\"_Tired_!\" Cora uttered the word in a repressed fury of emphasis.\n\"I'm sick of _everything_! I don't care for anything or anybody on\nthis earth--except--except you and mamma. I thought I was going to\nlove Val. I thought I _did_--but oh, my Lord, I don't! I don't\nthink I _can_ care any more. Or else there isn't any such thing as\nlove. How can anybody tell whether there is or not? You get kind\nof crazy over a man and want to go the limit--or marry him\nperhaps--or sometimes you just want to make him crazy about\nyou--and then you get over it--and what is there left but hell!\"\nShe choked with a sour laugh. \"Ugh! For heaven's sake, Laura,\ndon't make me talk. Everything's gone to the devil and I've got to\nthink. The best thing you can do is to go down and get rid of\nRichard for me. I _can't_ see him!\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Laura, and went to the door.\n\n\"You're a darling,\" whispered Cora, kissing her quickly. \"Tell him\nI'm in a raging headache--make him think I wanted to see him, but\nyou wouldn't let me, because I'm too ill.\" She laughed. \"Give me a\nlittle time, old dear: I may decide to take him yet!\"\n\nIt was Mrs. Madison who informed the waiting Richard that Cora was\nunable to see him, because she was \"lying down\"; and the young\nman, after properly inquiring about Mr. Madison, went blankly\nforth.\n\nHedrick was stalking the front yard, mounted at a great height\nupon a pair of stilts. He joined the departing visitor upon the\nsidewalk and honoured him with his company, proceeding storkishly\nbeside him.\n\n\"Been to see Cora?\"\n\n\"Yes, Hedrick.\"\n\n\"What'd you want to see her about?\" asked the frank youth\nseriously.\n\nRichard was able to smile. \"Nothing in particular, Hedrick.\"\n\n\"You didn't come to tell her about something?\"\n\n\"Nothing whatever, my dear sir. I wished merely the honour of\nseeing her and chatting with her upon indifferent subjects.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Did you see her?\"\n\n\"No, I'm sorry to----\"\n\n\"She's home, all right,\" Hedrick took pleasure in informing him.\n\n\"Yes. She was lying down and I told your mother not to disturb\nher.\"\n\n\"Worn out with too much automobile riding, I expect,\" Hedrick\nsniffed. \"She goes out about every day with this Corliss in his\nhired roadster.\"\n\nThey walked on in silence. Not far from Mrs. Lindley's, Hedrick\nabruptly became vocal in an artificial laugh. Richard was\nobviously intended to inquire into its cause, but, as he did not,\nHedrick, after laughing hollowly for some time, volunteered the\nexplanation:\n\n\"I played a pretty good trick on you last night.\"\n\n\"Odd I didn't know it.\"\n\n\"That's why it was good. You'd never guess it in the world.\"\n\n\"No, I believe I shouldn't. You see what makes it so hard,\nHedrick, is that I can't even remember seeing you, last night.\"\n\n\"Nobody saw me. Somebody heard me though, all right.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"The nigger that works at your mother's--Joe.\"\n\n\"What about it? Were you teasing Joe?\"\n\n\"No, it was you I was after.\"\n\n\"Well? Did you get me?\"\n\nHedrick made another somewhat ghastly pretence of mirth. \"Well, I\nguess I've had about all the fun out of it I'm going to. Might as\nwell tell you. It was that book of Laura's you thought she sent\nyou.\"\n\nRichard stopped short; whereupon Hedrick turned clumsily, and\nbegan to stalk back in the direction from which they had come.\n\n\"That book--I thought she--sent me?\" Lindley repeated, stammering.\n\n\"She never sent it,\" called the boy, continuing to walk away. \"She\nkept it hid, and I found it. I faked her into writing your name on\na sheet of paper, and made you think she'd sent the old thing to\nyou. I just did it for a joke on you.\"\n\nWith too retching an effort to simulate another burst of\nmerriment, he caught the stump of his right stilt in a pavement\ncrack, wavered, cut in the air a figure like a geometrical\nproposition gone mad, and came whacking to earth in magnificent\ndisaster.\n\nRichard took him to Mrs. Lindley for repairs. She kept him until\ndark: Hedrick was bandaged, led, lemonaded and blandished.\n\nNever in his life had he known such a listener.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\n\nThat was a long night for Cora Madison, and the morning found her\nyellow. She made a poor breakfast, and returned from the table to\nher own room, but after a time descended restlessly and wandered\nfrom one room to another, staring out of the windows. Laura had\ngone out; Mrs. Madison was with her husband, whom she seldom left;\nHedrick had departed ostensibly for school; and the house was as\nstill as a farm in winter--an intolerable condition of things for\nan effervescent young woman whose diet was excitement. Cora,\ndrumming with her fingers upon a window in the owl-haunted cell,\nmade noises with her throat, her breath and her lips not\nunsuggestive of a sputtering fuse. She was heavily charged.\n\n\"Now what in thunder do _you_ want?\" she inquired of an elderly\nman who turned in from the sidewalk and with serious steps\napproached the house.\n\nPryor, having rung, found himself confronted with the lady he had\ncome to seek. Ensued the moment of strangers meeting: invisible\nantennae extended and touched;--at the contact, Cora's drew in,\nand she looked upon him without graciousness.\n\n\"I just called,\" he said placatively, smiling as if some humour\nlurked in his intention, \"to ask how your father is. I heard\ndowntown he wasn't getting along quite so well.\"\n\n\"He's better this morning, thanks,\" said Cora, preparing to close\nthe door.\n\n\"I thought I'd just stop and ask about him. I heard he'd had\nanother bad spell--kind of a second stroke.\"\n\n\"That was night before last. The doctor thinks he's improved very\nmuch since then.\"\n\nThe door was closing; he coughed hastily, and detained it by\nspeaking again. \"I've called several times to inquire about him,\nbut I believe it's the first time I've had the pleasure of\nspeaking to you, Miss Madison. I'm Mr. Pryor.\" She appeared to\nfind no comment necessary, and he continued: \"Your father did a\nlittle business for me, several years ago, and when I was here on\nmy vacation, this summer, I was mighty sorry to hear of his\nsickness. I've had a nice bit of luck lately and got a second\nfurlough, so I came out to spend a couple of weeks and\nThanksgiving with my married daughter.\"\n\nCora supposed that it must be very pleasant.\n\n\"Yes,\" he returned. \"But I was mighty sorry to hear your father\nwasn't much better than when I left. The truth is, I wanted to\nhave a talk with him, and I've been reproaching myself a good deal\nthat I didn't go ahead with it last summer, when he was well, only\nI thought then it mightn't be necessary--might be disturbing\nthings without much reason.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you can't have a talk with him now,\" she said. \"The\ndoctor says----\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" said Pryor, \"of course. I wonder\"--he hesitated,\nsmiling faintly--\"I wonder if I could have it with you instead.\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"Oh, it isn't business,\" he laughed, observing her expression.\n\"That is, not exactly.\" His manner became very serious. \"It's\nabout a friend of mine--at least, a man I know pretty well. Miss\nMadison, I saw you driving out through the park with him,\nyesterday noon, in an automobile. Valentine Corliss.\"\n\nCora stared at him. Honesty, friendliness, and grave concern were\ndisclosed to her scrutiny. There was no mistaking him: he was a\ngood man. Her mouth opened, and her eyelids flickered as from a\ntoo sudden invasion of light--the look of one perceiving the close\napproach of a vital crisis. But there was no surprise in her face.\n\n\"Come in,\" she said.\n\n    *       *       *\n\n. . . . When Corliss arrived, at about eleven o'clock that\nmorning, Sarah brought him to the library, where he found Cora\nwaiting for him. He had the air of a man determined to be cheerful\nunder adverse conditions: he came in briskly, and Cora closed the\ndoor behind him.\n\n\"Keep away from me,\" she said, pushing him back sharply, the next\ninstant. \"I've had enough of that for a while I believe.\"\n\nHe sank into a chair, affecting desolation. \"Caresses blighted in\nthe bud! Cora, one would think us really married.\"\n\nShe walked across the floor to a window, turned there, with her\nback to the light, and stood facing him, her arms folded.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" he exclaimed, noting this attitude. \"Is it the\ntrial scene from a faded melodrama?\" She looked steadily at him\nwithout replying. \"What's it all about to-day?\" he asked lightly.\n\"I'll try to give you the proper cues if you'll indicate the\ngeneral nature of the scene, Cora mine.\"\n\nShe continued to look at him in silence.\n\n\"It's very effective,\" he observed. \"Brings out the figure, too.\nDo forgive me if you're serious, dear lady, but never in my life\nwas I able to take the folded-arms business seriously. It was used\non the stage of all countries so much that I believe most\nnew-school actors have dropped it. They think it lacks\ngenuineness.\"\n\nCora waited a moment longer, then spoke. \"How much chance have I\nto get Richard Lindley's money back from you?\"\n\nHe was astounded. \"Oh, I say!\"\n\n\"I had a caller, this morning,\" she said, slowly. \"He talked about\nyou--quite a lot! He's told me several things about you.\"\n\n\"Mr. Vilas?\" he asked, with a sting in his quick smile.\n\n\"No,\" she answered coolly. \"Much older.\"\n\nAt that he jumped up, stepped quickly close to her, and swept her\nwith an intense and brilliant scrutiny.\n\n\"Pryor, by God!\" he cried.\n\n\"He knows you pretty well,\" she said. \"So do I now!\"\n\nHe swung away from her, back to his chair, dropped into it and\nbegan to laugh. \"Old Pryor! Doddering old Pryor! Doddering old ass\nof a Pryor! So he did! Blood of an angel! what a stew, what a\nstew!\" He rose again, mirthless. \"Well, what did he say?\"\n\nShe had begun to tremble, not with fear. \"He said a good deal.\"\n\n\"Well, what was it? What did he tell you?\"\n\n\"I think you'll find it plenty!\"\n\n\"Come on!\"\n\n\"_You_!\" She pointed at him.\n\n\"Let's have it.\"\n\n\"He told me\"--she burst out furiously--\"he said you were a\nprofessional sharper!\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Old Pryor doesn't talk like that.\"\n\nShe came toward him. \"He told me you were notorious over half of\nEurope,\" she cried vehemently. \"He said he'd arrested you himself,\nonce, in Rotterdam, for smuggling jewels, and that you were\nguilty, but managed to squirm out of it. He said the police had\nput you out of Germany and you'd be arrested if you ever tried to\ngo back. He said there were other places you didn't dare set foot\nin, and he said he could have you arrested in this country any\ntime he wanted to, and that he was going to do it if he found\nyou'd been doing anything wrong. Oh, yes, he told me a few\nthings!\"\n\nHe caught her by the shoulder. \"See here, Cora, do you believe all\nthis tommy-rot?\"\n\nShe shook his hand off instantly. \"Believe it? I know it! There\nisn't a straight line in your whole soul and mind: you're crooked\nall over. You've been crooked with _me_ from the start. The moment\nthat man began to speak, I knew every word of it was true. He came\nto me because he thought it was right: he hasn't anything against\nyou on his own account; he said he _liked_ you! I _knew_ it was\ntrue, I tell you.\"\n\nHe tried to put his hand on her shoulder again, beginning to speak\nremonstratingly, but she cried out in a rage, broke away from him,\nand ran to the other end of the room.\n\n\"Keep away! Do you suppose I like you to touch me? He told me you\nalways had been a wonder with women! Said you were famous for\n`handling them the right way'--using them! Ah, that was pleasant\ninformation for _me_, wasn't it! Yes, I could have confirmed him\non that point. He wanted to know if I thought you'd been doing\nanything of that sort here. What he meant was: Had you been using\nme?\"\n\n\"What did you tell him?\" The question rang sharply on the instant.\n\n\"Ha! That gets into you, does it?\" she returned bitterly. \"You\ncan't overdo your fear of that man, I think, but _I_ didn't tell\nhim anything. I just listened and thanked him for the warning, and\nsaid I'd have nothing more to do with you. How _could_ I tell him?\nWasn't it I that made papa lend you his name, and got Richard to\nhand over his money? Where does that put _me_?\" She choked; sobs\nbroke her voice. \"Every--every soul in town would point me out as\na laughing-stock--the easiest fool out of the asylum! Do you\nsuppose _I_ want you arrested and the whole thing in the papers?\nWhat I want is Richard's money back, and I'm going to have it!\"\n\n\"Can you be quiet for a moment and listen?\" he asked gravely.\n\n\"If you'll tell me what chance I have to get it back.\"\n\n\"Cora,\" he said, \"you don't want it back.\"\n\n\"Oh? Don't I?\"\n\n\"No.\" He smiled faintly, and went on. \"Now, all this nonsense of\nold Pryor's isn't worth denying. I have met him abroad; that much\nis true--and I suppose I have rather a gay reputation----\"\n\nShe uttered a jeering shout.\n\n\"Wait!\" he said. \"I told you I'd cut quite a swathe, when I first\ntalked to you about myself. Let it go for the present and come\ndown to this question of Lindley's investment----\"\n\n\"Yes. That's what I want you to come down to.\"\n\n\"As soon as Lindley paid in his check I gave him his stock\ncertificates, and cabled the money to be used at once in the\ndevelopment of the oil-fields----\"\n\n\"What! That man told me you'd `promoted' a South American rubber\ncompany once, among people of the American colony in Paris. The\ndetails he gave me sounded strangely familiar!\"\n\n\"You'd as well be patient, Cora. Now, that money has probably been\npartially spent, by this time, on tools and labour and----\"\n\n\"What are you trying to----\"\n\n\"I'll show you. But first I'd like you to understand that nothing\ncan be done to me. There's nothing `on' me! I've acted in good\nfaith, and if the venture in oil is unsuccessful, and the money\nlost, I can't be held legally responsible, nor can any one prove\nthat I am. I could bring forty witnesses from Naples to swear they\nhave helped to bore the wells. I'm safe as your stubborn friend,\nMr. Trumble, himself. But now then, suppose that old Pryor is\nright--as of course he isn't--suppose it, merely for a moment,\nbecause it will aid me to convey something to your mind. If I were\nthe kind of man he says I am, and, being such a man, had planted\nthe money out of reach, for my own use, what on earth would induce\nme to give it back?\"\n\n\"I knew it!\" she groaned. \"I knew you wouldn't!\"\n\n\"You see,\" he said quietly, \"it would be impossible. We must go on\nsupposing for a moment: if I had put that money away, I might be\ncontemplating a departure----\"\n\n\"You'd better!\" she cried fiercely. \"He's going to find out\neverything you've been doing. He said so. He's heard a rumour that\nyou were trying to raise money here; he told me so, and said he'd\nsoon----\"\n\n\"The better reason for not delaying, perhaps. Cora, see here!\" He\nmoved nearer her. \"Wouldn't I need a lot of money if I expected to\nhave a beautiful lady to care for, and----\"\n\n\"You idiot!\" she screamed. \"Do you think I'm going with you?\"\n\nHe flushed heavily. \"Well, aren't you?\" He paused, to stare at\nher, as she wrung her hands and sobbed with hysterical laughter.\n\"I thought,\" he went on, slowly, \"that you would possibly even\ninsist on that.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord!\" She stamped her foot, and with both hands\nthrew the tears from her eyes in wide and furious gestures. \"He\ntold me you were married----\"\n\n\"Did you let him think you hadn't known that?\" demanded Corliss.\n\n\"I tell you I didn't let him think _anything_! He said you would\nnever be able to get a divorce: that your wife hates you too much\nto get one from you, and that she'll never----\"\n\n\"See here, Cora,\" he said harshly, \"I told you I'd been married; I\ntold you before I ever kissed you. You understood perfectly----\"\n\n\"I did not! You said you _had_ been. You laughed about it. You\nmade me think it was something that had happened a long time ago.\nI thought of course you'd been divorced----\"\n\n\"But I told you----\"\n\n\"You told me after! And then you made me think you could easily\nget one--that it was only a matter of form and----\"\n\n\"Cora,\" he interrupted, \"you're the most elaborate little\nself-deceiver I ever knew. I don't believe you've ever faced\nyourself for an honest moment in----\"\n\n\"Honest! _you_ talk about `honest'! You use that word and face\n_me_?\"\n\nHe came closer, meeting her distraught eyes squarely. \"You love to\nfool yourself, Cora, but the role of betrayed virtue doesn't suit\nyou very well. You're young, but you're a pretty experienced woman\nfor all that, and you haven't done anything you didn't want to.\nYou've had both eyes open every minute, and we both know it. You\nare just as wise as----\"\n\n\"You're lying and _you_ know it! What did _I_ want to make Richard\ngo into your scheme for? You made a fool of me.\"\n\n\"I'm not speaking of the money now,\" he returned quickly. \"You'd\nbetter keep your mind on the subject. Are you coming away with\nme?\"\n\n\"What for?\" she asked.\n\n\"What _for_?\" he echoed incredulously. \"I want to know if you're\ncoming. I promise you I'll get a divorce as soon as it's\npossible----\"\n\n\"Val,\" she said, in a tone lower than she had used since he\nentered the room; \"Val, do you want me to come?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Much?\" She looked at him eagerly.\n\n\"Yes, I do.\" His answer sounded quite genuine.\n\n\"Will it hurt you if I don't?\"\n\n\"Of course it will.\"\n\n\"Thank heaven for that,\" she said quietly.\n\n\"You honestly mean you won't?\"\n\n\"It makes me sick with laughing just to imagine it! I've done some\nhard little thinking, lately, my friend--particularly last night,\nand still more particularly this morning since that man was here.\nI'd cut my throat before I'd go with you. If you had your divorce\nI wouldn't marry you--not if you were the last man on earth!\"\n\n\"Cora,\" he cried, aghast, \"what's the matter with you? You're too\nmany for me sometimes. I thought I understood a few kinds of\nwomen! Now listen: I've offered to take you, and you can't\nsay----\"\n\n\"Offered!\" It was she who came toward him now. She came swiftly,\nshaking with rage, and struck him upon the breast. \"`Offered'! Do\nyou think I want to go trailing around Europe with you while Dick\nLindley's money lasts? What kind of a life are you `offering' me?\nDo you suppose I'm going to have everybody saying Cora Madison ran\naway with a jail-bird? Do you think I'm going to dodge decent\npeople in hotels and steamers, and leave a name in this town\nthat--Oh, get out! I don't want any help from you! I can take care\nof myself, I tell you; and I don't have to marry _you_! I'd kill\nyou if I could--you made a fool of me!\" Her voice rose shrilly.\n\"You made a fool of me!\"\n\n\"Cora----\" he began, imploringly.\n\n\"You made a fool of me!\" She struck him again.\n\n\"Strike me,\" he said. \"I love you!\"\n\n\"Actor!\"\n\n\"Cora, I want you. I want you more than I ever----\"\n\nShe screamed with hysterical laughter. \"Liar, liar, liar! The same\nold guff. Don't you even see it's too late for the old rotten\ntricks?\"\n\n\"Cora, I want you to come.\"\n\n\"You poor, conceited fool,\" she cried, \"do you think you're the\nonly man I can marry?\"\n\n\"Cora,\" he gasped, \"you wouldn't do that!\"\n\n\"Oh, get out! Get out _now_! I'm tired of you. I never want to\nhear you speak again.\"\n\n\"Cora,\" he begged. \"For the last time----\"\n\n\"_No_! You made a fool of me!\" She beat him upon the breast,\nstriking again and again, with all her strength. \"Get out, I\ntell you! I'm through with you!\"\n\nHe tried to make her listen, to hold her wrists: he could do\nneither.\n\n\"Get out--get out!\" she screamed. She pushed and dragged him\ntoward the door, and threw it open. Her voice thickened; she\nchoked and coughed, but kept on screaming: \"Get out, I tell you!\nGet out, get out, damn you! Damn you, _damn_ you! get out!\"\n\nStill continuing to strike him with all her strength, she forced\nhim out of the door.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\n\nCora lost no time. Corliss had not closed the front door behind\nhim before she was running up the stairs. Mrs. Madison, emerging\nfrom her husband's room, did not see her daughter's face; for Cora\npassed her quickly, looking the other way.\n\n\"Was anything the matter?\" asked the mother anxiously. \"I thought\nI heard----\"\n\n\"Nothing in the world,\" Cora flung back over her shoulder. \"Mr.\nCorliss said I couldn't imitate Sara Bernhardt, and I showed him I\ncould.\" She began to hum; left a fragment of \"rag-time\" floating\nbehind her as she entered her own room; and Mrs. Madison,\nrelieved, returned to the invalid.\n\nCora changed her clothes quickly. She put on a pale gray skirt and\ncoat for the street, high shoes and a black velvet hat, very\nsimple. The costume was almost startlingly becoming to her: never\nin her life had she looked prettier. She opened her small\njewel-case, slipped all her rings upon her fingers; then put the\ndiamond crescent, the pendant, her watch, and three or four other\nthings into the flat, envelope-shaped bag of soft leather she\ncarried when shopping. After that she brought from her\nclothes-pantry a small travelling-bag and packed it hurriedly.\n\nLaura, returning from errands downtown and glancing up at Cora's\nwindow, perceived an urgently beckoning, gray-gloved hand, and\ncame at once to her sister's room.\n\nThe packed bag upon the bed first caught her eye; then Cora's\nattire, and the excited expression of Cora's face, which was\nhigh-flushed and moist, glowing with a great resolve.\n\n\"What's happened?\" asked Laura quickly. \"You look exactly like a\ngoing-away bride. What----\"\n\nCora spoke rapidly: \"Laura, I want you to take this bag and keep\nit in your room till a messenger-boy comes for it. When the bell\nrings, go to the door yourself, and hand it to him. Don't give\nHedrick a chance to go to the door. Just give it to the boy;--and\ndon't say anything to mamma about it. I'm going downtown and I may\nnot be back.\"\n\nLaura began to be frightened.\n\n\"What is it you want to do, Cora?\" she asked, trembling.\n\nCora was swift and business-like. \"See here, Laura, I've got to\nkeep my head about me. You can do a great deal for me, if you\nwon't be emotional just now, and help me not to be. I can't afford\nit, because I've got to do things, and I'm going to do them just\nas quickly as I can, and get it over. If I wait any longer I'll go\ninsane. I _can_'T wait! You've been a wonderful sister to me; I've\nalways counted on you, and you've never once gone back on me.\nRight now, I need you to help me more than I ever have in my life.\nWill you----\"\n\n\"But I must know----\"\n\n\"No, you needn't! I'll tell you just this much: I've got myself in\na devil of a mess----\"\n\nLaura threw her arms round her: \"Oh, my dear, dear little sister!\"\nshe cried.\n\nBut Cora drew away. \"Now that's just what you mustn't do. I can't\nstand it! You've got to be _quiet_. I can't----\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" Laura said hurriedly. \"I will. I'll do whatever you\nsay.\"\n\n\"It's perfectly simple: all I want you to do is to take charge of\nmy travelling-bag, and, when a messenger-boy comes, give it to him\nwithout letting anybody know anything about it.\"\n\n\"But I've got to know where you're going--I can't let you go and\nnot----\"\n\n\"Yes, you can! Besides, you've promised to. I'm not going to do\nanything foolish ----\"\n\n\"Then why not tell me?\" Laura began. She went on, imploring Cora\nto confide in her, entreating her to see their mother--to do a\ndozen things altogether outside of Cora's plans.\n\n\"You're wasting your breath, Laura,\" said the younger sister,\ninterrupting, \"and wasting my time. You're in the dark: you think\nI'm going to run away with Val Corliss and you're wrong. I sent\nhim out of the house for good, a while ago----\"\n\n\"Thank heaven for that!\" cried Laura.\n\n\"I'm going to take care of myself,\" Cora went on rapidly. \"I'm\ngoing to get out of the mess I'm in, and you've got to let me do\nit my own way. I'll send you a note from downtown. You see that\nthe messenger----\"\n\nShe was at the door, but Laura caught her by the sleeve,\nprotesting and beseeching.\n\nCora turned desperately. \"See here. I'll come back in two hours\nand tell you all about it. If I promise that, will you promise to\nsend me the bag by the----\"\n\n\"But if you're coming back you won't need----\"\n\nCora spoke very quietly. \"I'll go to pieces in a moment. Really, I\ndo think I'd better jump out of the window and have it over.\"\n\n\"I'll send the bag,\" Laura quavered, \"if you'll promise to come\nback in two hours.\"\n\n\"I promise!\"\n\nCora gave her a quick embrace, a quick kiss, and, dry-eyed, ran\nout of the room, down the stairs, and out of the house.\n\nShe walked briskly down Corliss Street. It was a clear day, bright\nnoon, with an exhilarating tang in the air, and a sky so glorious\nthat people outdoors were continually conscious of the blue\noverhead, and looked up at it often. An autumnal cheerfulness was\nabroad, and pedestrians showed it in their quickened steps, in\ntheir enlivened eyes, and frequent smiles, and in the colour of\ntheir faces. But none showed more colour or a gayer look than\nCora. She encountered many whom she knew, for it was indeed a day\nto be stirring, and she nodded and smiled her way all down the\nlong street, thinking of what these greeted people would say\nto-morrow. \"_I_ saw her yesterday, walking down Corliss Street,\nabout noon, in a gray suit and looking fairly radiant!\" Some of\nthose she met were enemies she had chastened; she prophesied their\nremarks with accuracy. Some were old suitors, men who had desired\nher; one or two had place upon her long list of boy-sweethearts:\nshe gave the same gay, friendly nod to each of them, and foretold\nhis morrow's thoughts of her, in turn. Her greeting of Mary Kane\nwas graver, as was aesthetically appropriate, Mr. Wattling's\nengagement having been broken by that lady, immediately after his\ndrive to the Country Club for tea. Cora received from the\nbeautiful jilt a salutation even graver than her own, which did\nnot confound her.\n\nHalfway down the street was a drug-store. She went in, and\nobtained appreciative permission to use the telephone. She came\nout well satisfied, and went swiftly on her way. Ten minutes\nlater, she opened the door of Wade Trumble's office.\n\nHe was alone; her telephone had caught him in the act of departing\nfor lunch. But he had been glad to wait--glad to the verge of\nagitation.\n\n\"By George, Cora!\" he exclaimed, as she came quickly in and closed\nthe door, \"but you _can_ look stunning! Believe me, that's some\nget-up. But let me tell you right here and now, before you begin,\nit's no use your tackling me again on the oil proposition. If\nthere was any chance of my going into it which there wasn't, not\none on earth--why, the very fact of your asking me would have\nstopped me. I'm no Dick Lindley, I beg to inform you: I don't\nspend my money helping a girl that I want, myself, to make a hit\nwith another man. You treated me like a dog about that, right in\nthe street, and you needn't try it again, because I won't stand\nfor it. You can't play _me_, Cora!\"\n\n\"Wade,\" she said, coming closer, and looking at him mysteriously,\n\"didn't you tell me to come to you when I got through playing?\"\n\n\"What?\" He grew very red, took a step back from her, staring at\nher distrustfully, incredulously.\n\n\"I've got through playing\", she said in a low voice. \"And I've\ncome to you.\"\n\nHe was staggered. \"You've come----\" he said, huskily.\n\n\"Here I am, Wade.\"\n\nHe had flushed, but now the colour left his small face, and he\ngrew very white. \"I don't believe you mean it.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" she said. \"I was rotten to you about that oil nonsense.\nIt _was_ nonsense, nothing on earth but nonsense. I tell you\nfrankly I was a fool. I didn't care the snap of my finger for\nCorliss, but--oh, what's the use of pretending? You were always\nsuch a great `business man,' always so absorbed in business, and\nput it before everything else in the world. You cared for me, but\nyou cared for business more than for me. Well, no woman likes\n_that_, Wade. I've come to tell you the whole thing: I can't stand\nit any longer. I suffered horribly because--because----\" She\nfaltered. \"Wade, that was no way to _win_ a girl.\"\n\n\"Cora!\" His incredulity was strong.\n\n\"I thought I hated you for it, Wade. Yes, I did think that; I'm\ntelling you everything, you see just blurting it out as it comes,\nWade. Well, Corliss asked me to help him, and it struck me I'd\nshow that I could understand a business deal, myself. Wade, this\nis pretty hard to say, I was such a little fool, but you ought to\nknow it. You've got a right to know it, Wade: I thought if I put\nthrough a thing like that, it would make a tremendous hit with\nyou, and that then I could say: `So this is the kind of thing you\nput ahead of _me_, is it? Simple little things like this, that _I_\ncan do, myself, by turning over my little finger!' So I got\nRichard to go in--that was easy; and then it struck me that the\ncrowning triumph of the whole thing would be to get you to come in\nyourself. That _would_ be showing you, I thought! But you\nwouldn't: you put me in my place--and I was angry--I never was so\nangry in my life, and I showed it.\" Tears came into her voice.\n\"Oh, Wade,\" she said, softly, \"it was the very wildness of my\nanger that showed what I really felt.\"\n\n\"About--about _me_?\" His incredulity struggled with his hope. He\nstepped close to her.\n\n\"What an awful fool I've been,\" she sighed.\n\n\"Why, I thought I could show you I was your _equal_! And look what\nit's got me into, Wade!\"\n\n\"What has it got you into, Cora?\"\n\n\"One thing worth while: I can see what I really am when I try to\nmeet you on your own ground.\" She bent her head, humbly, then\nlifted it, and spoke rapidly. \"All the rest is dreadful, Wade. I\nhad a distrust of Corliss from the first; I didn't like him, but I\ntook him up because I thought he offered the chance to show _you_\nwhat I could do. Well, it's got me into a most horrible mess. He's\na swindler, a rank----\"\n\n\"By George!\" Wade shouted. \"Cora, you're talking out now like a\nreal woman.\"\n\n\"Listen. I got horribly tired of him after a week or so, but I'd\npromised to help him and I didn't break with him; but yesterday I\njust couldn't stand him any longer and I told him so, and sent him\naway. Then, this morning, an old man came to the house, a man\nnamed Pryor, who knew him and knew his record, and he told me all\nabout him.\" She narrated the interview.\n\n\"But you had sent Corliss away first?\" Wade asked, sharply.\n\n\"Yesterday, I tell you.\" She set her hand on the little man's\nshoulder. \"Wade, there's bound to be a scandal over all this. Even\nif Corliss gets away without being arrested and tried, the whole\nthing's bound to come _out_. I'll be the laughing-stock of the\ntown--and I deserve to be: it's all through having been ridiculous\nidiot enough to try and impress you with my business brilliancy.\nWell, I can't stand it!\"\n\n\"Cora, do you----\" He faltered.\n\nShe leaned toward him, her hand still on his shoulder, her\nexquisite voice lowered, and thrilling in its sweetness. \"Wade,\nI'm through playing. I've come to you at last because you've\nutterly conquered me. If you'll take me away to-day, I'll _marry_\nyou to-day!\"\n\nHe gave a shout that rang again from the walls.\n\n\"Do you want me?\" she whispered; then smiled upon his rapture\nindulgently.\n\nRapture it was. With the word \"marry,\" his incredulity sped\nforever. But for a time he was incoherent: he leaped and hopped,\nspoke broken bits of words, danced fragmentarily, ate her with his\neyes, partially embraced her, and finally kissed her timidly.\n\n\"Such a wedding we'll have!\" he shouted, after that.\n\n\"No!\" she said sharply. \"We'll be married by a Justice of the\nPeace and not a soul there but us, and it will be now, or it never\nwill be! If you don't----\"\n\nHe swore she should have her way.\n\n\"Then we'll be out of this town on the three o'clock train this\nafternoon,\" she said. She went on with her plans, while he,\ngrowing more accustomed to his privilege, caressed her as he\nwould. \"You shall have your way,\" she said, \"in everything except\nthe wedding-journey. That's got to be a long one--I won't come\nback here till people have forgotten all about this Corliss\nmix-up. I've never been abroad, and I want you to take me. We can\nstay a long, long time. I've brought nothing--we'll get whatever\nwe want in New York before we sail.\"\n\nHe agreed to everything. He had never really hoped to win her;\nparadise had opened, dazing him with glory: he was astounded, mad\nwith joy, and abjectly his lady's servant.\n\n\"Hadn't you better run along and get the license?\" she laughed.\n\"We'll have to be married on the way to the train.\" \"Cora!\" he\ngasped. \"You angel!\"\n\n\"I'll wait here for you,\" she smiled. \"There won't be too much\ntime.\"\n\nHe obtained a moderate control of his voice and feet.\n\"Enfield--that's my cashier--he'll be back from his lunch at\none-thirty. Tell him about us, if I'm not here by then. Tell him\nhe's got to manage somehow. Good-bye till I come back Mrs.\nTrumble!\"\n\nAt the door he turned. \"Oh, have you--you----\" He paused\nuncertainly. \"Have you sent Richard Lindley any word about----\"\n\n\"Wade!\" She gave his inquiry an indulgent amusement. \"If I'm not\nworrying about him, do you think you need to?\"\n\n\"I meant about----\"\n\n\"You funny thing,\" she said. \"I never had any idea of really\nmarrying him; it wasn't anything but one of those silly\nhalf-engagements, and----\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that,\" he said, apologetically. \"I meant about\nletting him know what this Pryor told you about Corliss, so that\nRichard might do something toward getting his money back. We ought\nto--\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" she said quickly. \"Yes, that's all right.\"\n\n\"You saw Richard?\"\n\n\"No. I sent him a note. He knows all about it by this time, if he\nhas been home this morning. You'd better start, Wade. Send a\nmessenger to our house for my bag. Tell him to bring it here and\nthen take a note for me. You'd really better start--dear!\"\n\n\"_Cora_!\" he shouted, took her in his arms, and was gone. His\ndeparting gait down the corridor to the elevator seemed, from the\nsounds, to be a gallop.\n\nLeft alone, Cora wrote, sealed, and directed a note to Laura. In\nit she recounted what Pryor had told her of Corliss; begged Laura\nand her parents not to think her heartless in not preparing them\nfor this abrupt marriage. She was in such a state of nervousness,\nshe wrote, that explanations would have caused a breakdown. The\nmarriage was a sensible one; she had long contemplated it as a\npossibility; and, after thinking it over thoroughly, she had\ndecided it was the only thing to do. She sent her undying love.\n\nShe was sitting with this note in her hand when shuffling\nfootsteps sounded in the corridor; either Wade's cashier or the\nmessenger, she supposed. The door-knob turned, a husky voice\nasking, \"Want a drink?\" as the door opened.\n\nCora was not surprised--she knew Vilas's office was across the\nhall from that in which she waited--but she was frightened.\n\nRay stood blinking at her.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" he asked, at last.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\n\nIt is probable that he got the truth out of her, perhaps all of\nit. That will remain a matter of doubt; Cora's evidence, if she\ngave it, not being wholly trustworthy in cases touching herself.\nBut she felt no need of mentioning to any one that she had seen\nher former lover that day. He had gone before the return of\nEnfield, Mr. Trumble's assistant, who was a little later than\nusual, it happened; and the extreme nervousness and preoccupation\nexhibited by Cora in telling Enfield of his employer's new plans\nwere attributed by the cashier to the natural agitation of a lady\nabout to wed in a somewhat unusual (though sensible) manner.\n\nIt is the more probable that she told Ray the whole truth, because\nhe already knew something of Corliss's record abroad. On the dusty\ndesk in Ray's own office lay a letter, received that morning from\nthe American Consul at Naples, which was luminous upon that\nsubject, and upon the probabilities of financial returns for the\ninvestment of a thousand dollars in the alleged oil-fields of\nBasilicata.\n\nIn addition, Cora had always found it very difficult to deceive\nVilas: he had an almost perfect understanding of a part of her\nnature; she could never far mislead him about herself. With her,\nhe was intuitive and jumped to strange, inconsistent, true\nconclusions, as women do. He had the art of reading her face, her\ngestures; he had learned to listen to the tone of her voice more\nthan to what she said. In his cups, too, he had fitful but almost\ndemoniac inspirations for hidden truth.\n\nAnd, remembering that Cora always \"got even,\" it remains finally\nto wonder if she might not have told him everything at the\ninstance of some shadowy impulse in that direction. There may have\nbeen a luxury in whatever confession she made; perhaps it was not\nentirely forced from her, and heaven knows how she may have\ncoloured it. There was an elusive, quiet satisfaction somewhere in\nher subsequent expression; it lurked deep under the surface of the\nexcitement with which she talked to Enfield of her imminent\nmarital abduction of his small boss.\n\nHer agitation, a relic of the unknown interview just past,\nsimmered down soon, leaving her in a becoming glow of colour, with\nslender threads of moisture brilliantly outlining her eyelids. Mr.\nEnfield, a young, well-favoured and recent importation from\nanother town, was deliciously impressed by the charm of the\nwaiting lady. They had not met; and Enfield wondered how Trumble\nhad compassed such an enormous success as this; and he wished that\nhe had seen her before matters had gone so far. He thought he\nmight have had a chance. She seemed pleasantly interested in him,\neven as it was--and her eyes were wonderful, with their swift,\nwarm, direct little plunges into those of a chance comrade of the\nmoment. She went to the window, in her restlessness, looking down\nupon the swarming street below, and the young man, standing beside\nher, felt her shoulder most pleasantly though very lightly--in\ncontact with his own, as they leaned forward, the better to see\nsome curiosity of advertising that passed. She turned her face to\nhis just then, and told him that he must come to see her: the\nwedding journey would be long, she said, but it would not be\nforever.\n\nTrumble bounded in, shouting that everything was attended to,\nexcept instructions to Enfield, whom he pounded wildly upon the\nback. He began signing papers; a stenographer was called from\nanother room of his offices; and there was half an hour of\nrapid-fire. Cora's bag came, and she gave the bearer the note for\nLaura; another bag was brought for Wade; and both bags were\ncarried down to the automobile the bridegroom had left waiting in\nthe street. Last, came a splendid cluster of orchids for the bride\nto wear, and then Wade, with his arm about her, swept her into the\ncorridor, and the stirred Enfield was left to his own beating\nheart, and the fresh, radiant vision of this startling new\nacquaintance: the sweet mystery of the look she had thrown back at\nhim over his employer's shoulder at the very last. \"Do not forget\n_me_!\" it had seemed to say. \"We shall come back--some day.\"\n\nThe closed car bore the pair to the little grim marriage-shop\nquickly enough, though they were nearly run down by a furious\npolice patrol automobile, at a corner near the Richfield Hotel.\nTheir escape was by a very narrow margin of safety, and Cora\nclosed her eyes. Then she was cross, because she had been\nfrightened, and commanded Wade cavalierly to bid the driver be\nmore careful.\n\nWade obeyed sympathetically. \"Of course, though, it wasn't\naltogether his fault,\" he said, settling back, his arm round his\nlady's waist. \"It's an outrage for the police to break their own\nrules that way. I guess they don't need to be in a hurry any more\nthan _we_ do!\"\n\nThe Justice made short work of it.\n\nAs they stood so briefly before him, there swept across her vision\nthe memory of what she had always prophesied as her wedding:--a\ncrowded church, \"The Light That Breathed O'er Eden\" from an unseen\nsinger; then the warm air trembling to the Lohengrin march; all\nheads turning; the procession down the aisle; herself\nappearing--climax of everything--a delicious and brilliant figure:\ngraceful, rosy, shy, an imperial prize for the groom, who in these\nforeshadowings had always been very indistinct. The picture had\nalways failed in outline there: the bridegroom's nearest approach\nto definition had never been clearer than a composite photograph.\nThe truth is, Cora never in her life wished to be married.\n\nBut she was.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\n\nValentine Corliss had nothing to do but to wait for the money\nhis friend Antonio would send him by cable. His own cable,\nanticipating his letter, had been sent yesterday, when he came\nback to the hotel, after lunching in the country with Cora.\n\nAs he walked down Corliss Street, after his tumultuous interview\nwith her, he was surprised to find himself physically tremulous:\nhe had not supposed that an encounter, however violent, with an\nangry woman could so upset his nerves. It was no fear of Pryor\nwhich shook him. He knew that Pryor did not mean to cause his\narrest--certainly not immediately. Of course, Pryor knew that Cora\nwould tell him. The old fellow's move was a final notification. It\nmeant: \"Get out of town within twenty-four hours.\" And Corliss\nintended to obey. He would have left that evening, indeed, without\nthe warning; his trunk was packed.\n\nHe would miss Cora. He had kept a cool head throughout their\naffair until the last; but this morning she had fascinated him:\nand he found himself passionately admiring the fury of her. She\nhad confused him as he had never been confused. He thought he had\ntamed her; thought he owned her; and the discovery of this mistake\nwas what made him regret that she would not come away with him.\nSuch a flight, until to-day, had been one of his apprehensions:\nbut now the thought that it was not to be, brought something like\npain. At least, he felt a vacancy; had a sense of something\nlacking. She would have been a bright comrade for the voyage; and\nhe thought of gestures of hers, turns of the head, tricks of the\nlovely voice; and sighed.\n\nOf course it was best for him that he could return to his old\ntrails alone and free; he saw that. Cora would have been a\ncomplication and an embarrassment without predictable end, but she\nwould have been a rare flame for a while. He wondered what she\nmeant to do; of course she had a plan. Should he try again, give\nher another chance? No; there was one point upon which she had not\nmystified him: he knew she really hated him.\n\n. . . The wind was against the smoke that day; and his spirits\nrose, as he walked in the brisk air with the rich sky above him.\nAfter all, this venture upon his native purlieus had been fax from\nfruitless: he could not have expected to do much better. He had\nmade his coup; he knew no other who could have done it. It was a\nhandsome bit of work, in fact, and possible only to a talented\nnative thoroughly sophisticated in certain foreign subtleties. He\nknew himself for a rare combination.\n\nHe had a glimmer of Richard Lindley beginning at the beginning\nagain to build a modest fortune: it was the sort of thing the\nRichard Lindleys were made for. Corliss was not troubled. Richard\nhad disliked him as a boy; did not like him now; but Corliss had\nnot taken his money out of malice for that. The adventurer was not\nrevengeful; he was merely impervious.\n\nAt the hotel, he learned that Moliterno's cable had not yet\narrived; but he went to an agency of one of the steamship lines\nand reserved his passage, and to a railway ticket office and\nsecured a compartment for himself on an evening train. Then he\nreturned to his room in the hotel.\n\nThe mirror over the mantelpiece, in the front room of his suite,\nshowed him a fine figure of a man: hale, deep-chested, handsome,\nstraight and cheerful.\n\nHe nodded to it.\n\n\"Well, old top,\" he said, reviewing and summing up his whole\ncampaign, \"not so bad. Not so bad, all in all; not so bad, old\ntop. Well played indeed!\"\n\nAt a sound of footsteps approaching his door, he turned in casual\nexpectancy, thinking it might be a boy to notify him that\nMoliterno's cable had arrived. But there was no knock, and the\ndoor was flung wide open.\n\nIt was Vilas, and he had his gun with him this time. He had two.\n\nThere was a shallow clothes-closet in the wall near the fireplace,\nand Corliss ran in there; but Vilas began to shoot through the\ndoor.\n\nMutilated, already a dead man, and knowing it, Corliss came out,\nand tried to run into the bedroom. It was no use.\n\nRay saved his last shot for himself. It did the work.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\n\nThere is a song of parting, an intentionally pathetic song, which\ncontains the line, \"All the tomorrows shall be as to-day,\" meaning\nequally gloomy. Young singers, loving this line, take care to\npronounce the words with unusual distinctness: the listener may\nfeel that the performer has the capacity for great and consistent\nsuffering. It is not, of course, that youth loves unhappiness, but\nthe appearance of it, its supposed picturesqueness. Youth runs\nfrom what is pathetic, but hangs fondly upon pathos. It is the\nidea of sorrow, not sorrow, which charms: and so the young singer\ndwells upon those lingering tomorrows, happy in the conception of\na permanent wretchedness incurred in the interest of sentiment.\nFor youth believes in permanence.\n\nIt is when we are young that we say, \"I shall never,\" and \"I shall\nalways,\" not knowing that we are only time's atoms in a crucible\nof incredible change. An old man scarce dares say, \"I have never,\"\nfor he knows that if he searches he will find, probably, that he\nhas. \"All, all is change.\"\n\nIt was an evening during the winter holidays when Mrs. Lindley,\ncoming to sit by the fire in her son's smoking-room, where Richard\nsat glooming, narrated her legend of the Devil of Lisieux. It must\nhave been her legend: the people of Lisieux know nothing of it;\nbut this Richard the Guileless took it for tradition, as she\nalleged it, and had no suspicion that she had spent the afternoon\ninventing it.\n\nShe did not begin the recital immediately upon taking her chair,\nacross the hearth from her son; she led up to it. She was an\nample, fresh-coloured, lively woman; and like her son only in\nbeing a kind soul: he got neither his mortal seriousness nor his\ndreaminess from her. She was more than content with Cora's\nabandonment of him, though, as chivalrousness was not demanded of\nher, she would have preferred that he should have been the jilt.\nShe thought Richard well off in his release, even at the price of\nall his savings. But there was something to hope, even in that\nmatter, Pryor wrote from Paris encouragingly: he believed that\nMoliterno might be frightened or forced into at least a partial\nrestitution; though Richard would not count upon it, and had\n\"begun at the beginning\" again, as a small-salaried clerk in a\nbank, trudging patiently to work in the morning and home in the\nevening, a long-faced, tired young man, more absent than ever,\nlifeless, and with no interest in anything outside his own\nbroodings. His mother, pleased with his misfortune in love, was of\ncourse troubled that it should cause him to suffer. She knew she\ncould not heal him; but she also knew that everything is healed in\ntime, and that sometimes it is possible for people to help time a\nlittle.\n\nHer first remark to her son, this evening, was that to the best of\nher memory she had never used the word \"hellion.\" And, upon his\nsaying gently, no, he thought it probable that she never had, but\nseeking no farther and dropping his eyes to the burning wood,\napparently under the impression that the subject was closed, she\ninformed him brusquely that it was her intention to say it now.\n\n\"What is it you want to say, mother?\"\n\n\"If I can bring myself to use the word `hellion',\" she returned,\n\"I'm going to say that of all the heaven-born, whole-souled and\nconsistent ones I ever knew Hedrick Madison is the King.\"\n\n\"In what new way?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Egerton Villard. Egerton used to be the neatest, best-mannered,\nbest-dressed boy in town; but he looks and behaves like a Digger\nIndian since he's taken to following Hedrick around. Mrs. Villard\nsays it's the greatest sorrow of her life, but she's quite\npowerless: the boy is Hedrick's slave. The other day she sent a\nservant after him, and just bringing him home nearly ruined her\nlimousine. He was solidly covered with molasses, over his clothes\nand all, from head to foot, and then he'd rolled in hay and\nchicken feathers to be a _gnu_ for Hedrick to kodak in the African\nWilds of the Madisons' stable. Egerton didn't know what a gnu was,\nbut Hedrick told him that was the way to be one, he said. Then,\nwhen they'd got him scraped and boiled, and most of his hair\npulled out, a policemen came to arrest him for stealing the jug of\nmolasses at a corner grocery.\"\n\nRichard nodded, and smiled faintly for comment. They sat in\nsilence for a while.\n\n\"I saw Mrs. Madison yesterday,\" said his mother. \"She seemed very\ncheerful; her husband is able to talk almost perfectly again,\nthough he doesn't get downstairs. Laura reads to him a great\ndeal.\"\n\nHe nodded again, his gaze not moving from the fire.\n\n\"Laura was with her mother,\" said Mrs. Lindley. \"She looked very\nfetching in a black cloth suit and a fur hat--old ones her sister\nleft, I suspect, but very becoming, for all that. Laura's `going\nout' more than usual this winter. She's really the belle of the\nholiday dances, I hear. Of course she would be\", she added,\nthoughtfully--\"now.\"\n\n\"Why should she be `now' more than before?\"\n\n\"Oh, Laura's quite blossomed,\" Mrs. Lindley answered. \"I think\nshe's had some great anxieties relieved. Of course both she and\nher mother must have worried about Cora as much as they waited on\nher. It must be a great burden lifted to have her comfortably\nsettled, or, at least, disposed of. I thought they both looked\nbetter. But I have a special theory about Laura: I suppose you'll\nlaugh at me----\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\"\n\n\"I wish you would sometimes,\" she said wistfully, \"so only you\nlaughed. My idea is that Laura was in love with that poor little\nTrumble, too.\"\n\n\"What?\" He looked up at that.\n\n\"Yes; girls fall in love with anybody. I fancy she cared very\ndeeply for him; but I think she's a strong, sane woman, now. She's\nabout the steadiest, coolest person I know--and I know her better,\nlately, than I used to. I think she made up her mind that she'd\nnot sit down and mope over her unhappiness, and that she'd get\nover what caused it; and she took the very best remedy: she began\ngoing about, going everywhere, and she went gayly, too! And I'm\nsure she's cured; I'm sure she doesn't care the snap of her\nfingers for Wade Trumble or any man alive. She's having a pretty\ngood time, I imagine: she has everything in the world except\nmoney, and she's never cared at all about _that_. She's young, and\nshe dresses well--these days--and she's one of the handsomest\ngirls in town; she plays like a poet, and she dances well----\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Richard;--reflectively, \"she does dance well.\"\n\n\"And from what I hear from Mrs. Villard,\" continued his mother, \"I\nguess she has enough young men in love with her to keep any girl\nbusy.\"\n\nHe was interested enough to show some surprise. \"In love with\nLaura?\"\n\n\"Four, I hear.\" The best of women are sometimes the readiest with\nimpromptu statistics.\n\n\"Well, well!\" he said, mildly.\n\n\"You see, Laura has taken to smiling on the world, and the world\nsmiles back at her. It's not a bad world about that, Richard.\"\n\n\"No,\" he sighed. \"I suppose not.\"\n\n\"But there's more than that in this case, my dear son.\"\n\n\"Is there?\"\n\nThe intelligent and gentle matron laughed as though at some\nunexpected turn of memory and said:\n\n\"Speaking of Hedrick, did you ever hear the story of the Devil of\nLisieux, Richard?\"\n\n\"I think not; at least, I don't remember it.\"\n\n\"Lisieux is a little town in Normandy,\" she said. \"I was there a\nfew days with your father, one summer, long ago. It's a country\nfull of old stories, folklore, and traditions; and the people\nstill believe in the Old Scratch pretty literally. This legend was\nof the time when he came to Lisieux. The people knew he was coming\nbecause a wise woman had said that he was on the way, and\npredicted that he would arrive at the time of the great fair.\nEverybody was in great distress, because they knew that whoever\nlooked at him would become bewitched, but, of course, they had to\ngo to the fair. The wise woman was able to give them a little\ncomfort; she said some one was coming with the devil, and that the\npeople must not notice the devil, but keep their eyes fastened on\nthis other--then they would be free of the fiend's influence. But,\nwhen the devil arrived at the fair, nobody even looked to see who\nhis companion was, for the devil was so picturesque, so vivid, all\nin flaming scarlet and orange, and he capered and danced and sang\nso that nobody could help looking at him--and, after looking once,\nthey couldn't look away until they were thoroughly under his\nspell. So they were all bewitched, and began to scream and howl\nand roll on the ground, and turn on each other and brawl, and\n`commit all manner of excesses.' Then the wise woman was able to\nexorcise the devil, and he sank into the ground; but his companion\nstayed, and the people came to their senses, and looked, and they\nsaw that it was an angel. The angel had been there all the time\nthat the fiend was, of course. So they have a saying now, that\nthere may be angels with us, but we don't notice them when the\ndevil's about.\"\n\nShe did not look at her son as she finished, and she had hurried\nthrough the latter part of her \"legend\" with increasing timidity.\nThe parallel was more severe, now that she put it to him, than she\nintended; it sounded savage; and she feared she had overshot her\nmark. Laura, of course, was the other, the companion; she had been\nactually a companion for the vivid sister, everywhere with her at\nthe fair, and never considered: now she emerged from her\novershadowed obscurity, and people were able to see her as an\nindividual--heretofore she had been merely the retinue of a\nflaming Cora. But the \"legend\" was not very gallant to Cora!\n\nMrs. Lindley knew that it hurt her son; she felt it without\nlooking at him, and before he gave a sign. As it was, he did not\nspeak, but, after a few moments, rose and went quietly out of the\nroom: then she heard the front door open and close. She sat by his\nfire a long, long time and was sorry--and wondered.\n\nWhen Richard came home from his cold night-prowl in the snowy\nstreets, he found a sheet of note paper upon his pillow:\n\n\n\"Dearest Richard, I didn't mean that anybody you ever cared for\nwas a d---l. I only meant that often the world finds out that\nthere are lovely people it hasn't noticed.\"\n\n\n. . . He reproached himself, then, for the reproach his leaving\nher had been; he had a susceptible and annoying conscience, this\nunfortunate Richard. He found it hard to get to sleep, that night;\nand was kept awake long after he had planned how he would make up\nto his mother for having received her \"legend\" so freezingly. What\nkept him awake, after that, was a dim, rhythmic sound coming from\nthe house next door, where a holiday dance was in progress--music\nfar away and slender: fiddle, 'cello, horn, bassoon, drums, all\nrollicking away almost the night-long, seeping through the walls\nto his restless pillow. Finally, when belated drowsiness came, the\nthrobbing tunes mingled with his half-dreams, and he heard the\nlight shuffling of multitudinous feet over the dancing-floor, and\nbecame certain that Laura's were among them. He saw her, gliding,\nswinging, laughing, and happy and the picture did not please him:\nit seemed to him that she would have been much better employed\nsitting in black to write of a hopeless love. Coquetting with four\nsuitors was not only inconsistent; it was unbecoming. It \"suited\nCora's style,\" but in Laura it was outrageous. When he woke, in\nthe morning, he was dreaming of her: dressed as Parthenia,\nbeautiful, and throwing roses to an acclaiming crowd through which\nshe was borne on a shield upon the shoulders of four Antinouses.\nRichard thought it scandalous.\n\nHis indignation with her had not worn off when he descended to\nbreakfast, but he made up to his mother for having troubled her.\nThen, to cap his gallantry, he observed that several inches of\nsnow must have fallen during the night; it would be well packed\nupon the streets by noon; he would get a sleigh, after lunch, and\ntake her driving. It was a holiday.\n\nShe thanked him, but half-declined. \"I'm afraid it's too cold for\nme, but there are lots of nice girls in town, Richard, who won't\nmind weather.\"\n\n\"But I asked _you_!\" It was finally left an open question for the\nafternoon to settle; and, upon her urging, he went out for a walk.\nShe stood at the window to watch him, and, when she saw that he\nturned northward, she sank into a chair, instead of going to give\nJoe Varden his after-breakfast instructions, and fell into a deep\nreverie.\n\nOutdoors, it was a biting cold morning, wind-swept and gray; and\nwith air so frosty-pure no one might breathe it and stay bilious:\nneither in body nor bilious in spirit. It was a wind to sweep the\nyellow from jaundiced cheeks and make them rosy; a wind to clear\ndulled eyes; it was a wind to lift foolish hearts, to lift them so\nhigh they might touch heaven and go winging down the sky, the\nwildest of wild-geese.\n\n. . . When the bell rang, Laura was kneeling before the library\nfire, which she had just kindled, and she had not risen when Sarah\nbrought Richard to the doorway. She was shabby enough, poor\nCinderella! looking up, so frightened, when her prince appeared.\n\nShe had not been to the dance.\n\nShe had not four suitors. She had none.\n\nHe came toward her. She rose and stepped back a little. Ashes had\nblown upon her, and, oh, the old, old thought of the woman born to\nbe a mother! she was afraid his clothes might get dusty if he came\ntoo close.\n\nBut to Richard she looked very beautiful; and a strange thing\nhappened: trembling, he saw that the firelight upon her face was\nbrighter than any firelight he had ever seen."
