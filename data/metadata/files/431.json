FEUERSTEIN\n\nOn an afternoon late in April Feuerstein left his boarding-house in\nEast Sixteenth Street, in the block just beyond the eastern gates of\nStuyvesant Square, and paraded down Second Avenue.\n\nA romantic figure was Feuerstein, of the German Theater stock company.\nHe was tall and slender, and had large, handsome features.  His coat\nwas cut long over the shoulders and in at the waist to show his lines\nof strength and grace.  He wore a pearl-gray soft hat with rakish brim,\nand it was set with suspicious carelessness upon bright blue, and\nseemed to blazon a fiery, sentimental nature.  He strode along,\nintensely self-conscious, not in the way that causes awkwardness, but\nin the way that causes a swagger.  One had only to glance at him to\nknow that he was offensive to many men and fascinating to many women.\n\nNot an article of his visible clothing had been paid for, and the\nten-cent piece in a pocket of his trousers was his total cash balance.\nBut his heart was as light as the day.  Had he not youth?  Had he not\nhealth?  Had he not looks to bewitch the women, brains to outwit the\nmen?  Feuerstein sniffed the delightful air and gazed round, like a\nking in the midst of cringing subjects.  \"I feel that this is one of my\nlucky days,\" said he to himself.  An aristocrat, a patrician, a\nHochwohlgeboren, if ever one was born.\n\nAt the Fourteenth-Street crossing he became conscious that a young man\nwas looking at him with respectful admiration and with the anxiety of\none who fears a distinguished acquaintance has forgotten him.\nFeuerstein paused and in his grandest, most gracious manner, said:\n\"Ah!  Mr. Hartmann--a glorious day!\"\n\nYoung Hartmann flushed with pleasure and stammered, \"Yes--a GLORIOUS\nday!\"\n\n\"It is lucky I met you,\" continued Feuerstein.  \"I had an appointment\nat the Cafe Boulevard at four, and came hurrying away from my lodgings\nwith empty pockets--I am so absent-minded. Could you convenience me for\na few hours with five dollars?  I'll repay you to-night--you will be at\nGoerwitz's probably?  I usually look in there after the theater.\"\n\nHartmann colored with embarrassment.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said humbly, \"I've got only a two-dollar bill. If it\nwould--\"\n\nFeuerstein looked annoyed.  \"Perhaps  I can make that do.  Thank\nyou--sorry to trouble you.  I MUST be more careful.\"\n\nThe two dollars were transferred, Feuerstein gave Hartmann a\nflourishing stage salute and strode grandly on.  Before he had gone ten\nyards he had forgotten Hartmann and had dismissed all financial\ncare--had he not enough to carry him through the day, even should he\nmeet no one who would pay for his dinner and his drinks?  \"Yes, it is a\nday to back myself to win--fearlessly!\"\n\nThe hedge at the Cafe Boulevard was green and the tables were in the\nyard and on the balconies; but Feuerstein entered, seated himself in\none of the smoke-fogged reading-rooms, ordered a glass of beer, and\ndivided his attention between the Fliegende Blatter and the faces of\nincoming men.  After half an hour two men in an arriving group of three\nnodded coldly to him.  He waited until they were seated,  then joined\nthem and proceeded to make himself agreeable to the one who had just\nbeen introduced to him--young Horwitz, an assistant bookkeeper at a\ndepartment store in Twenty-third Street.  But Horwitz had a \"soul,\" and\nthe yearning of that secret soul was for the stage.  Feuerstein did\nHorwitz the honor of dining with him.  At a quarter past seven, with\nhis two dollars intact, with a loan of one dollar added to it, and with\nfive of his original ten cents, he took himself away to the theater.\nAfterward, by appointment, he met his new friend, and did him the honor\nof accompanying him to the Young German Shooters' Society ball at\nTerrace Garden.\n\nIt was one of those simple, entirely and genuinely gay entertainments\nthat assemble the society of the real New York--the three and a half\nmillions who work and play hard and live plainly and without pretense,\nwhose ideals center about the hearth, and whose aspirations are to\nretire with a competence early in the afternoon of life, thenceforth\nplacidly to assist in the prosperity of their children and to have\ntheir youth over again in their grandchildren.\n\nFeuerstein's gaze wandered from face to face among the young women, to\npause at last upon a dark, handsome, strong-looking daughter of the\npeople.  She had coal-black hair that curled about a low forehead.  Her\neyes were dreamy and stormy.  Her mouth was sweet, if a trifle\npetulant.  \"And who is she?\" he asked.\n\n\"That's Hilda Brauner,\" replied Horwitz.  \"Her father has a\ndelicatessen in Avenue A.  He's very rich--owns three flat-houses.\nThey must bring him in at least ten thousand net, not to speak of what\nhe makes in the store.  They're fine people, those Brauners; none nicer\nanywhere.\"\n\n\"A beautiful creature,\" said Feuerstein, who was feeling like a prince\nwho, for reasons of sordid necessity, had condescended to a party in\nFifth Avenue.  \"I'd like to meet her.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Horwitz.  \"I'll introduce her to you.\"\n\nShe blushed and was painfully ill at ease in presence of his grand and\nlofty courtesy--she who had been used to the offhand manners which\nprevail wherever there is equality of the sexes and the custom of frank\nsociability.  And when he asked her to dance she would have refused had\nshe been able to speak at all.  But he bore her off and soon made her\nforget herself in the happiness of being drifted in his strong arm upon\nthe rhythmic billows of the waltz.  At the end he led her to a seat and\nfell to complimenting her--his eyes eloquent, his voice, it seemed to\nher, as entrancing as the waltz music.  When  he spoke in German it was\nwithout the harsh sputtering and growling, the slovenly slurring and\nclipping to which she had been accustomed.  She could answer only with\nmonosyllables or appreciative looks, though usually she was a great\ntalker and, as she had much common sense and not a little wit, a good\ntalker.  But her awe of him, which increased when she learned that he\nwas on the stage, did not prevent her from getting the two main\nimpressions he wished to make upon her--that Mr. Feuerstein was a very\ngrand person indeed, and that he was condescending to be profoundly\nsmitten of her charms.\n\nShe was the \"catch\" of Avenue A, taking prospects and looks together,\nand the men she knew had let her rule them.  In Mr. Feuerstein she had\nfound what she had been unconsciously seeking with the Idealismus of\ngenuine youth--a man who compelled her to look far up to him, a  man\nwho seemed to her to embody those vague dreams of a life grand and\nbeautiful, away off somewhere, which are dreamed by all young people,\nand by not a few older ones, who have less excuse for not knowing where\nhappiness is to be found.  He spent the whole evening with her; Mrs.\nLiebers and Sophie, with whom she had come, did not dare interrupt her\npleasure, but had to stay, yawning and cross, until the last strain of\nHome, Sweet Home.\n\nAt parting he pressed her hand.  \"I have been happy,\" he murmured in a\ntone which said, \"Mine is a sorrow-shadowed soul that has rarely tasted\nhappiness.\"\n\nShe glanced up at him with ingenuous feeling in her eyes and managed to\nstammer:  \"I hope we'll meet again.\"\n\n\"Couldn't I come down to see you Sunday evening?\"\n\n\"There's a concert in the Square.  If you're there I might see you.\"\n\n\"Until Sunday night,\" he said, and made her feel that the three\nintervening days would be for him three eternities.\n\nShe thought of him all the way home in the car, and until she fell\nasleep.  His sonorous name was in her mind when she awoke in the\nmorning; and, as she stood in the store that day, waiting on the\ncustomers, she looked often at the door, and, with the\nchildhood-surviving faith of youth in the improbable and impossible,\nhoped that he would appear.  For the first time she was definitely\ndiscontented with her lot, was definitely fascinated by the idea that\nthere might be something higher and finer than the simple occupations\nand simple enjoyments which had filled her life thus far.\n\n\nIn the evening after supper her father and mother left her and her\nbrother August in charge, and took their usual stroll  for exercise and\nfor the profound delight of a look at their flat-houses--those\nreminders of many years of toil and thrift. They had spent their youth,\nshe as cook, he as helper, in one of New York's earliest delicatessen\nshops.  When they had saved three thousand dollars they married and put\ninto effect the plan which had been their chief subject of conversation\nevery day and every evening for ten years--they opened the\n\"delicatessen\" in Avenue A, near Second Street.  They lived in two back\nrooms; they toiled early and late for twenty-three contented, cheerful\nyears--she in the shop when she was not doing the housework or caring\nfor the babies, he in the great clean cellar, where the cooking and\ncabbage-cutting and pickling and spicing were done.  And now, owners of\nthree houses that brought in eleven thousand a year clear, they were\nabout to retire.  They had fixed on a place in the  Bronx, in the East\nSide, of course, with a big garden, where every kind of gay flower and\ngood vegetable could be grown, and an arbor where there could be\npinochle, beer and coffee on Sunday afternoons.  In a sentence, they\nwere honorable and exemplary members of that great mass of humanity\nwhich has the custody of the present and the future of the race--those\nwho live by the sweat of their own brows or their own brains, and train\ntheir children to do likewise, those who maintain the true ideals of\nhappiness and progress, those from whom spring all the workers and all\nthe leaders of thought and action.\n\nThey walked slowly up the Avenue, speaking to their neighbors, pausing\nnow and then for a joke or to pat a baby on the head, until they were\nwithin two blocks of Tompkins Square.  They stopped before a five-story\ntenement, evidently the dwelling-place of substantial, intelligent,\nself-respecting artisans and their families, leading the natural life\nof busy usefulness.  In its first floor was a delicatessen--the sign\nread \"Schwartz and Heilig.\" Paul Brauner pointed with his long-stemmed\npipe at the one show-window.\n\n\"Fine, isn't it?  Beautiful!\" he exclaimed in Low-German--they and\nalmost all their friends spoke Low-German, and used English only when\nthey could not avoid it.\n\nThe window certainly was well arranged.  Only a merchant who knew his\nbusiness thoroughly--both his wares and his customers--could have thus\ndisplayed cooked chickens, hams and tongues, the imported sausages and\nfish, the jelly-inclosed paste of chicken livers, the bottles and jars\nof pickled or spiced meats and vegetables and fruits.  The spectacle\nwas adroitly arranged to move the hungry to yearning, the filled to\nregret, and the dyspeptic to rage and remorse.  And behind the\nshow-window lay a shop whose shelves, counters and floor were clean as\ntoil could make and keep them, and whose air was saturated with the\nmost delicious odors.\n\nMrs. Brauner nodded.  \"Heilig was up at half-past four this morning,\"\nshe said.  \"He cleans out every morning and he moves everything twice a\nweek.\"  She had a round, honest face that was an inspiring study in\nsimplicity, sense and sentiment.\n\n\"What a worker!\" was her husband's comment.  \"So unlike most of the\nyoung men nowadays.  If August were only like him!\"\n\n\"You'd think Heilig was a drone if he were your son,\" replied Mrs.\nBrauner.  She knew that if any one else had dared thus to attack their\nboy, his father would have been growling and snapping like an angry\nbear.\n\n\"That's right!\" he retorted with mock  scorn.  \"Defend your children!\nYou'll be excusing Hilda for putting off Heilig next.\"\n\n\"She'll marry him--give her time,\" said Mrs. Brauner.  \"She's romantic,\nbut she's sensible, too--why, she was born to make a good wife to a\nhard-working man.  Where's there another woman that knows the business\nas she does?  You admit on her birthdays that she's the only real\nhelper you ever had.\"\n\n\"Except you,\" said her husband.\n\n\"Never mind me.\"  Mrs. Brauner pretended to disdain the compliment.\n\nBrauner understood, however.  \"We have had the best, you and I,\" said\nhe.\n\n\"Arbeit und Liebe und Heim.  Nicht wahr?\" Otto Heilig appeared in his\ndoorway and greeted them awkwardly.  Nor did their cordiality lessen\nhis embarrassment.  His pink and white skin was rosy red and his frank\nblue-gray eyes shifted  uneasily.  But he was smiling with eager\nfriendliness, showing even, sound, white teeth.\n\n\"You are coming to see us to-morrow?\" asked Mrs. Brauner--he always\ncalled on Sunday afternoons and stayed until five, when he had to open\nshop for the Sunday supper rush.\n\n\"Why--that is--not exactly--no,\" he stammered.  Hilda had told him not\nto come, but he knew that if he admitted it to her parents they would\nbe severe with her.  He didn't like anybody to be severe with Hilda,\nand he felt that their way of helping his courtship was not suited to\nthe modern ideas.  \"They make her hate me,\" he often muttered.  But if\nhe resented it he would offend them and Hilda too; if he acquiesced he\nencouraged them and added to Hilda's exasperation.\n\nMrs. Brauner knew at once that Hilda was in some way the cause of the\nbreak in  the custom.  \"Oh, you must come,\" she said. \"We'd feel\nstrange all week if we didn't see you on Sunday.\"\n\n\"Yes--I must have my cards,\" insisted Brauner.  He and Otto always\nplayed pinochle; Otto's eyes most of the time and his thoughts all the\ntime were on Hilda, in the corner, at the zither, playing the maddest,\nmost romantic music; her father therefore usually won, poor at the game\nthough he was.  It made him cross to lose, and Otto sometimes defeated\nhis own luck deliberately when love refused to do it for him.\n\n\"Very well, then--that is--if I can--I'll try to come.\"\n\nSeveral customers pushed past him into his shop and he had to rejoin\nhis partner, Schwartz, behind the counters.  Brauner and his wife\nwalked slowly home--it was late and there would be more business than\nHilda and August could attend  to.  As they crossed Third Street\nBrauner said:  \"Hilda must go and tell him to come. This is her doing.\"\n\n\"But she can't do that,\" objected Mrs. Brauner.  \"She'd say it was\nthrowing herself at his head.\"\n\n\"Not if I send her?\" Brauner frowned with a seeming of severity.  \"Not\nif I, her father, send her--for two chickens, as we're out?\"  Then he\nlaughed.  His fierceness was the family joke when Hilda was small she\nused to say, \"Now, get mad, father, and make little Hilda laugh!\"\n\nHilda was behind the counter, a customer watching with fascinated eyes\nthe graceful, swift movements of her arms and hands as she tied up a\nbundle.  Her sleeves were rolled to her dimpled elbows, and her arms\nwere round and strong and white, and her skin was fine and smooth.  Her\nshoulders were wide, but not square; her hips were narrow, her wrists,\nher hands, her head, small.  She looked healthy and vigorous and useful\nas well as beautiful.\n\nWhen the customers had gone Brauner said:  \"Go up to Schwartz and\nHeilig, daughter, and ask them for two two-pound chickens. And tell\nOtto Heilig you'll be glad to see him to-morrow.\"\n\n\"But we don't need the chickens, now.  We--\"  Hilda's brow contracted\nand her chin came out.\n\n\"Do as I tell you,\" said her father.\n\n\"MY children shall not sink to the disrespect of these days.\"\n\n\"But I shan't be here to-morrow!  I've made another engagement.\"\n\n\"You SHALL be here to-morrow!  If you don't wish young Heilig here for\nyour own sake, you must show consideration for your parents.  Are they\nto be deprived of their Sunday afternoon?  You have never done this\nbefore, Hilda.  You have never forgotten us before.\"\n\nHilda hung her head; after a moment she unrolled her sleeves, laid\naside her apron and set out.  She was repentant toward her father, but\nshe felt that Otto was to blame.  She determined to make him suffer for\nit--how easy it was to make him suffer, and how pleasant to feel that\nthis big fellow was her slave!  She went straight up to him.  \"So you\ncomplained of me, did you?\" she said scornfully, though she knew well\nthat he had not, that he could not have done anything that even seemed\nmean.\n\nHe flushed.  \"No--no,\" he stammered.  \"No, indeed, Hilda. Don't think--\"\n\nShe looked contempt.  \"Well, you've won.  Come down Sunday afternoon.\nI suppose I'll have to endure it.\"\n\n\"Hilda, you're wrong.  I will NOT come!\"  He was angry, but his mind\nwas confused.  He loved her with all the strength of his simple,\nstraightforward  nature.  Therefore he appeared at his worst before\nher--usually either incoherent or dumb.  It was not surprising that\nwhenever it was suggested that only a superior man could get on so well\nas he did, she always answered:  \"He works twice as hard as any one\nelse, and you don't need much brains if you'll work hard.\"\n\nShe now cut him short.  \"If you don't come I'll have to suffer for it,\"\nshe said.  \"You MUST come!  I'll not be glad to see you.  But if you\ndon't come I'll never speak to you again!\"  And she left him and went\nto the other counter and ordered the chickens from Schwartz.\n\nHeilig was wretched,--another of those hideous dilemmas over which he\nhad been stumbling like a drunken man in a dark room full of furniture\never since he let his mother go to Mrs. Brauner and ask her for Hilda.\nHe watched Hilda's splendid back, and fumbled about, upsetting bottles\nand rattling dishes, until she went out with a glance of jeering scorn.\nSchwartz burst out laughing.\n\n\"Anybody could tell you are in love,\" he said.  \"Be stiff with her,\nOtto, and you'll get her all right.  It don't do to let a woman see\nthat you care about her.  The worse you treat the women the better they\nlike it.  When they used to tell my father about some woman being crazy\nover a man, he always used to say, 'What sort of a scoundrel is he?'\nThat was good sense.\"\n\nOtto made no reply.  No doubt these maxims were sound and wise; but how\nwas he to apply them?  How could he pretend indifference when at sight\nof her he could open his jaws only enough to chatter them, could loosen\nhis tongue only enough to roll it thickly about?  \"I can work,\" he said\nto himself, \"and I can pay my debts and have something over; but when\nit comes to love I'm no good.\"\n\n\n\nII\n\nBRASS OUTSHINES GOLD\n\nHilda returned to her father's shop and was busy there until nine\no'clock.  Then Sophie Liebers came and they went into the Avenue for a\nwalk.  They pushed their way through and with the throngs up into\nTompkins Square--the center of one of the several vast districts,\nlittle known because little written about, that contain the real New\nYork and the real New Yorkers.  In the Square several thousand young\npeople were promenading, many of the girls walking in pairs, almost all\nthe young men paired off, each with a young woman.  It was warm, and\nthe stars beamed down upon the hearts of young lovers, blotting out for\nthem electric lights and surrounding crowds.  It caused no  comment\nthere for a young couple to walk hand in hand, looking each at the\nother with the expression that makes commonplace eyes wonderful.  And\nwhen the sound of a kiss came from a somewhat secluded bench, the only\nglances east in the direction whence it had come were glances of\napproval or envy.\n\n\"There's Otto Heilig dogging us,\" said Hilda to Sophie, as they walked\nup and down.  \"Do you wonder I hate him?\"  They talked in American, as\ndid all the young people, except with those of their elders who could\nspeak only German.\n\nSophie was silent.  If Hilda had been noting her face she would have\nseen a look of satisfaction.\n\n\"I can't bear him,\" went on Hilda.  \"No girl could.  He's so stupid\nand--and common!\"  Never before had she used that last word in such a\nsense.  Mr. Feuerstein had begun to educate her.\n\nSophie's unobserved look changed to resentment.  \"Of course he's not\nequal to Mr. Feuerstein,\" she said.  \"But he's a very nice fellow--at\nleast for an ordinary girl.\"  Sophie's father was an upholsterer, and\nnot a good one.  He owned no tenements--was barely able to pay the rent\nfor a small corner of one.  Thus her sole dower was her pretty face and\nher cunning.  She had an industrious, scheming, not overscrupulous\nbrain and--her hopes and plans.  Nor had she time to waste.  For she\nwas nearer twenty-three than twenty-two, at the outer edge of the\nmarriageable age of Avenue A, which believes in an early start at what\nit regards as the main business of life--the family.\n\n\"You surely couldn't marry such a man as Otto!\" said Hilda absently.\nHer eyes were searching the crowd, near and far.\n\nSophie laughed.  \"Beggars can't be choosers,\" she answered. \"I think\nhe's all  right--as men go.  It wouldn't do for me to expect too much.\"\n\nJust then Hilda caught sight of Mr. Feuerstein--the godlike head, the\nglorious hair, the graceful hat.  Her manner changed--her eyes\nbrightened, her cheeks reddened, and she talked fast and laughed a\ngreat deal.  As they passed near him she laughed loudly and called out\nto Sophie as if she were not at her elbow--she feared he would not see.\nMr. Feuerstein turned his picturesque head, slowly lifted his hat and\njoined them.  At once Hilda became silent, listening with rapt\nattention to the commonplaces he delivered in sonorous, oracular tones.\n\nAs he deigned to talk only to Hilda, who was walking between Sophie and\nhim, Sophie was free to gaze round.  She spied Otto Heilig drooping\ndejectedly along.  She adroitly steered her party so that it crossed\nhis path.  He looked up to find  himself staring at Hilda.  She frowned\nat this disagreeable apparition into her happiness, and quickened her\nstep.  But Sophie, without letting go of Hilda's hand, paused and spoke\nto Otto.  Thus Hilda was forced to stop and to say ungraciously:  \"Mr.\nFeuerstein, Mr. Heilig.\"\n\nThen she and Mr. Feuerstein went on, and Sophie drew the reluctant Otto\nin behind them.  She gradually slackened her pace, so that she and\nHeilig dropped back until several couples separated them from Hilda and\nMr. Feuerstein.  A few minutes and Hilda and Mr. Feuerstein were seated\non a bench in the deep shadow of a tree, Sophie and Heilig walking\nslowly to and fro a short distance away.\n\nHeilig was miserable with despondent jealousy.  He longed to inquire\nabout this remarkable-looking new friend of Hilda's.  For Mr.\nFeuerstein seemed to be of  that class of strangers whom Avenue A\ncondemns on their very appearance.  It associates respectability with\nwork only, and it therefore suspects those who look as if they did not\nwork and did not know how.  Sophie was soon answering of her own accord\nthe questions Heilig as a gentleman could not ask.  \"You must have\nheard of Mr. Feuerstein?  He's an actor--at the German Theater.  I\ndon't think he's much of an actor--he's one of the kind that do all\ntheir acting off the stage.\"\n\nHeilig laughed unnaturally.  He did not feel like laughing, but wished\nto show his gratitude to Sophie for this shrewd blow at his enemy.\n\"He's rigged out like a lunatic, isn't he?\"  Otto was thinking of the\nlong hair, the low-rolling shirt collar and the velvet collar on his\ncoat,--light gray, to match his hat and suit.\n\n\"I don't see what Hilda finds in him,\" continued Sophie.  \"It makes me\nlaugh to  look at him; and when he talks I can hardly keep from\nscreaming in his face.  But Hilda's crazy over him, as you see.  He\ntells all sorts of romances about himself, and she believes every word.\nI think she'll marry him--you know, her father lets her do as she\npleases.  Isn't it funny that a sensible girl like Hilda can be so\nfoolish?\"\n\nHeilig did not answer this, nor did he heed the talk on love and\nmarriage which the over-eager Sophie proceeded to give.  And it was\ntalk worth listening to, as it presented love and marriage in the\ninteresting, romantic-sensible Avenue A light.  Otto was staring\ngloomily at the shadow of the tree.  He would have been gloomier could\nhe have witnessed the scene to which the unmoral old elm was lending\nits impartial shade.\n\nMr. Feuerstein was holding Hilda's hand while he looked soulfully down\ninto  her eyes.  She was returning his gaze, her eyes expressing all\nthe Schwarmerei of which their dark depths were capable at nineteen.\nHe was telling her what a high profession the actor's was, how great he\nwas as an actor, how commonplace her life there, how beautiful he could\nmake it if only he had money.  It was an experience to hear Mr.\nFeuerstein say the word \"money.\"  Elocution could go no further in\nsurcharging five letters with contempt.  His was one of those lofty\nnatures that scorn all such matters of intimate concern to the humble,\nhard-pressed little human animal as food, clothing and shelter. He so\nloathed money that he would not deign to work for it, and as rapidly as\npossible got rid of any that came into his possession.\n\n\"Yes, my adorable little princess,\" he rolled out, in the tones which\nwove a spell over Hilda.  \"I adore you.  How strange  that _I_ should\nhave wandered into THIS region for my soul's bride--and should have\nfound her!\"\n\nHilda pressed his clasping hand and her heart fluttered.  But she was\nas silent and shy as Heilig with her.  What words had she fit to\nexpress response to these exalted emotions?  \"I--I feel it,\" she said\ntimidly.  \"But I can't say it to you.  You must think me very foolish.\"\n\n\"No--you need not speak.  I know what you would say.  Our hearts speak\neach to the other without words, my beautiful jewel.  And what do you\nthink your parents will say?\"\n\n\"I--I don't know,\" stammered Hilda.\n\n\"They are so set on my marrying\"--she glanced toward Otto--how ordinary\nhe looked!--\"marrying another--a merchant like my father.  They think\nonly of what is practical.  I'm so afraid they won't understand--US.\"\n\nFeuerstein sighed--the darkness prevented her from seeing that he was\nalso frowning with impatience and irritation.\n\n\"But it must be settled at once, my heart's bride,\" he said gently.\n\"Secrecy, deception are horrible to me.  And I am mad to claim you as\nmy own.  I could not take you without their consent--that would be\nunworthy.  No, I could not grieve their honest hearts!\"\n\nHilda was much disturbed.  She was eminently practical herself, aside\nfrom her fondness for romance, which Mr. Feuerstein was developing in a\nway so unnatural in her surroundings, so foreign to her education; and\nshe could see just how her father would look upon her lover.  She\nfeared he would vent plain speech that would cut Mr. Feuerstein's\nsensitive soul and embattle his dignity and pride against his love.\n\"I'll speak to them as soon as I can,\" she said.\n\n\"Then you will speak to them to-morrow or next day, my treasure, and I\nshall see you on Sunday afternoon.\"\n\n\"No--not Sunday afternoon.  I must stay at home--father has ordered it.\"\n\n\"Disappointment--deception--postponement!\"  Feuerstein struck his hand\nupon his brow and sighed tragically.  \"Oh, my little Erebus-haired\nangel, how you do test my love!\"\n\nHilda was almost in tears--it was all intensely real to her.  She felt\nthat he was superfine, that he suffered more than ordinary folk, like\nherself and her people.  \"I'll do the best I can,\" she pleaded.\n\n\"It would be best for you to introduce them to me at once and let ME\nspeak.\"\n\n\"No--no,\" she protested earnestly, terror in her voice and her hand\ntrembling in his.  \"That would spoil everything.  You wouldn't\nunderstand them, or they you.  I'll speak--and see you Monday night.\"\n\n\"Let it be so,\" he conceded.  \"But I must depart.  I am studying a new\nrole.\"  He had an engagement to take supper with several of his\nintimates at the Irving Place cafe, where he could throw aside the\nheaviest parts of his pose and give way to his appetite for beer and\nSchweizerkase sandwiches.  \"How happy we shall be!\" he murmured\ntenderly, kissing her cheek and thinking how hard it was to be\npractical and keep remote benefits in mind when she was so beautiful\nand so tempting and so trustful.  He said aloud:  \"I am impatient,\nsoul's delight!  Is it strange?\" And he bowed like a stage courtier to\na stage queen and left her.\n\nShe joined Sophie and Heilig and walked along in silence, Sophie\nbetween Otto and her.  He caught glimpses of her face, and it made his\nheart ache and his courage faint to see the love-light in her eyes--and\nshe as far away from him as Heaven from hell, far away in a world from\nwhich he was excluded.  He and Sophie left her at her father's and he\ntook Sophie home.\n\nSophie felt that she had done a fair evening's work--not progress, but\nprogress in sight.  \"At least,\" she reflected, \"he's seeing that he\nisn't in it with Hilda and never can be.  I must hurry her on and get\nher married to that fool.  A pair of fools!\"\n\nHeilig found his mother waiting up for him.  As she saw his expression,\nanxiety left her face, but cast a deeper shadow over her heart.  She\nfelt his sorrow as keenly as he--she who would have laid down her life\nfor him gladly.\n\n\"Don't lose heart, my big boy,\" she said, patting him on the shoulder\nas he bent to kiss her.\n\nAt this he dropped down beside her and hid his face in her lap and\ncried like the  boy-man that he was.  \"Ach, Gott, mother, I love her\nSO!\" he sobbed.\n\nHer tears fell on the back of his head.  Her boy--who had gone so\nbravely to work when the father was killed at his machine, leaving them\npenniless; her boy--who had laughed and sung and whistled and diffused\nhope and courage and made her feel that the burden was not a burden but\na joy for his strong, young shoulders.\n\n\"Courage, beloved!\" she said.  \"Hilda is a good girl.  All will yet be\nwell.\"  And she felt it--God would not be God if He could let this\nheart of gold be crushed to powder.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nFORTUNE FAVORS THE IMPUDENT\n\nLike all people who lead useful lives and neither have nor pretend to\nhave acquired tastes for fine-drawn emotion, Otto and Hilda indulged in\nlittle mooning.  They put aside their burdens--hers of dread, his of\ndespair--and went about the work that had to be done and that\nhealthfully filled almost all their waking moments; and when bed-time\ncame their tired bodies refused either to sit up with their brains or\nto let their brains stay awake.  But it was gray and rainy for Hilda\nand black night for Otto.\n\nOn Sunday morning he rose at half-past three, instead of at four, his\nweek-day rising time.  Many of his hard-working customers were astir\nbetimes on Sunday to have the longer holiday.  As they would spend the\ndaylight hours in the country and would not reach home until after the\nshop had closed, they bought the supplies for a cold or warmed-up\nsupper before starting.  Otto looked so sad--usually he was in high\nspirits--that most of these early customers spoke to him or to Joe\nSchwartz about his health. There were few of them who did not know what\nwas troubling him. Among those friendly and unpretending and\nwell-acquainted people any one's affairs were every one's affairs--why\nmake a secret of what was, after all, only the routine of human life\nthe world over and the ages through?  Thus Otto had the lively but\ntactful sympathy of the whole community.\n\nHe became less gloomy under the warmth of this succession of friendly\nfaces and friendly inquiries.  But as trade slackened, toward noon, he\nhad more leisure to think, and the throbbing ache returned to his heavy\nheart.  All the time pictures of her were passing before his eyes.  He\nhad known her so long and she had become such an intimate part of his\ndaily life, so interwoven with it, that he could not look at present,\npast or future without seeing her.\n\nWhy, he had known her since she was a baby.  Did he not remember the\nday when he, a small boy on his way to school, had seen her toddle\nacross the sidewalk in front of him?  Could he ever forget how she had\nreached with great effort into a snowbank, had dug out with her small,\nred-mittened hands a chunk of snow, and, lifting it high above her\nhead, had thrown it weakly at him with such force that she had fallen\nheadlong upon the sidewalk?  He had seen her every day since\nthen--every day!\n\nHe most clearly of all recalled her as a  school-girl.  Those were the\ndays of the German bands of six and seven and even eight pieces,\nwandering as the hand-organs do now.  And always with them came a swarm\nof little girls who danced when the band played, and of little boys who\nlistened and watched.  He had often followed her as she followed a\nband, all day on a Saturday. And he had never wearied of watching her\nlong, slim legs twinkling tirelessly to the music.  She invented new\nfigures and variations on steps which the other girls adopted.  She and\nher especial friends became famous among the children throughout the\nEast Side; even grown people noted the grace and originality of a\nparticular group of girls, led by a black-haired, slim-legged one who\ndanced with all there was of her.  And how their mothers did whip them\nwhen they returned from a day of this forbidden joy! But they were off\nagain the next Saturday--who would not pass a bad five minutes for the\nsake of hours on hours of delight?\n\nAnd Hilda was gone from his life, was sailing away on his ship--was it\nnot his ship? was not its cargo his hopes and dreams and plans?--was\nsailing away with another man at the helm!  And he could do\nnothing--must sit dumb upon the shore.\n\nAt half-past twelve he closed the shop and, after the midday dinner\nwith his mother, went down to Brauner's.  Hilda was in the room back of\nthe shop, alone, and so agitated with her own affairs that she forgot\nto be cold and contemptuous to Otto.  He bowed to her, then stood\nstaring at the framed picture of Die Wacht am Rhein as if he had never\nbefore seen the wonderful lady in red and gold seated under a tree and\ngazing out over the river--all the verses were underneath.  When he\ncould stare at it no longer he turned to  the other wall where hung the\ntarget bearing the marks of Paul Brauner's best shots in the prize\ncontest he had won.  But he saw neither the lady watching the Rhine nor\nthe target with its bullet holes all in the bull's-eye ring, and its\npendent festoon of medals.  He was longing to pour out his love for\nher, to say to her the thousand things he could say to the image of her\nin his mind when she was not near.  But he could only stand, an awkward\nfigure, at which she would have smiled if she had seen it at all.\n\nShe went out into the shop.  While he was still trying to lay hold of\nan end of the spinning tangle of his thoughts and draw it forth in the\nhope that all would follow, she returned, fright in her eyes.  She\nclasped her hands nervously and her cheeks blanched.  \"Mr. Feuerstein!\"\nshe exclaimed.  \"And he's coming here!  What SHALL I do?\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\" he asked.\n\nShe turned upon him angrily--he was the convenient vent for her\nnervousness.  \"It's all your fault!\" she exclaimed.  \"They want to\nforce me to marry you.  And I dare not bring here the man I love.\"\n\n\"My fault?\" he muttered, dazed.  \"I'm not to blame.\"\n\n\"Stupid!  You're always in the way--no wonder I HATE you!\"  She was\nclasping and unclasping her hands, trying to think, not conscious of\nwhat she was saying.\n\n\"Hate me?\" he repeated mechanically. \"Oh, no--surely not that. No, you\ncan't--\"\n\n\"Be still!  Let me think.  Ach! Gott im Himmel!  He's in the hall!\"\nShe sank wretchedly into a chair.  \"Can you do nothing but gape and\nmutter?\"  In her desperation her tone was appealing.\n\n\"He can say he came with me,\" said Otto.  \"I'll stand for him.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes!\" she cried.  \"That will do!  Thank you--thank you!\"  And as\nthe knock came at the door she opened it.  She had intended to be\nreproachful, but she could not.  This splendid, romantic creature, with\nhis graceful hat and his golden hair and his velvet collar, was too\ncompelling, too overpowering.  Her adoring love put her at a hopeless\ndisadvantage.  \"Oh--Mr. Feuerstein,\" she murmured, her color coming and\ngoing with the rise and fall of her bosom.\n\nMr. Feuerstein majestically removed his hat and turned a look of\nhaughty inquiry upon Otto.  Otto's fists clenched--he longed to discuss\nthe situation in the only way which seemed to him to meet its\nrequirements.\n\n\"Hilda,\" said the actor, when he thought there had been a long enough\npause for an imposing entrance, \"I have come to end the deception--to\nmake you,  before the world, as you are before Almighty God, my\naffianced bride.\"\n\n\"You--you mustn't,\" implored Hilda, her fears getting the better of her\nawe.\n\n\"If my parents learn now--just now, they will--oh, it will be hopeless!\"\n\n\"I can not delay, angel of my heart!\"  He gave her the look that is the\ntheatrical convention for love beyond words.  \"It must be settled at\nonce.  I must know my fate.  I must put destiny to the touch and know\nhappiness or--hell!\"\n\n\"Bah!\" thought Otto.  \"He has to hurry matters--he must be in trouble.\nHe's got to raise the wind at once.\"\n\n\"Mr. Feuerstein--Carl!\" pleaded Hilda.  \"PLEASE try to be practical.\"\nShe went up to him, and Otto turned away, unable to bear the sight of\nthat look of love, tenderness and trust.  \"You must not--at least, not\nright away.\"  She turned to Otto. \"Help me, Otto.  Explain to him.\"\n\nHeilig tried to put courtesy in his voice as he said to Mr. Feuerstein:\n\"Miss Brauner is right.  You'll only wreck her--her happiness.  We're\nplain people down here and don't understand these fine, grand ways.\nYou must pass as my friend whom I brought here--but I make one\ncondition.\"  He drew a long breath and looked at Hilda.  For the first\ntime she heard him, the real Otto Heilig, speak.  \"Hilda,\" he went on,\n\"I don't want to hurt you--I'd do anything for you, except hurt you.\nAnd I can't stand for this fel--for Mr. Feuerstein, unless you'll\npromise me you won't marry him, no matter what he may say, until your\nfather has had a chance to find out who and what he is.\"\n\nMr. Feuerstein drew himself up grandly.  \"Who is this person, Miss\nBrauner?\" he demanded with haughty coldness.\n\n\"He don't know any better,\" she replied hurriedly.  \"He's an old\nfriend.  Trust me,  Mr. Feuer--Carl!  Everything depends on it.\"\n\n\"I can not tolerate this coarse hand between me and the woman I love.\nNo more deception!  Carl Feuerstein\"--how he did roll out that\nname!--\"can guard his own honor and his own destiny.\"\n\nThe door into the private hall opened and in came Brauner and his wife,\nfine pictures of homely content triumphing over the discomforts of\nSunday clothes.  They looked at Mr. Feuerstein with candidly\nquestioning surprise.  Avenue A is not afraid to look, and speak, its\nmind.  Otto came forward.  \"This is Mr. Feuerstein,\" he said.\n\nAt once Brauner showed that he was satisfied, and Mrs. Brauner beamed.\n\"Oh, a friend of yours,\" Brauner said, extending his hand.  \"Glad to\nsee any friend of Otto's.\"\n\nMr. Feuerstein advanced impressively and bowed first over Brauner's\nhand, then over Mrs. Brauner's.  \"I am not a friend of this--young\nman,\" he said with the dignity of a Hoheit.  \"I have come here to\npropose for the honor of your daughter's hand in marriage.\"\n\nMr. Feuerstein noted the stupefied expression of the delicatessen\ndealer and his wife, and glanced from Otto to Hilda with a triumphant\nsmile.  But Hilda was under no delusion.  She shivered and moved nearer\nto Otto.  She felt that he was her hope in this crisis which the mad\nlove of her hero-lover had forced.  Brauner was the more angry because\nhe had been thus taken by surprise.\n\n\"What nonsense is this?\" he growled, shaking his head violently.  \"My\ndaughter is engaged to a plain man like ourselves.\"\n\nAt this Heilig came forward again, pale and sad, but calm.  \"No, Mr.\nBrauner--she is not engaged.  I'm sure she loves this gentleman, and I\nwant her to be happy.  I can not be anything to her but her friend.\nAnd I want you to give him a chance to show himself worthy of her.\"\n\nBrauner burst out furiously at Hilda. The very presence of this gaudy,\nuseless-looking creature under his roof was an insult to his three gods\nof honor and happiness--his \"Arbeit und Liebe und Heim.\"\n\n\"What does this mean?\" he shouted.\n\n\"Where did you find this crazy fellow?  Who brought him here?\"\n\nHilda flared.  \"I love him, father!  He's a noble, good man.  I shall\nalways love him.  Listen to Otto--it'll break my heart if you frown on\nmy marrying the man I love.\"  There was a touch of Mr. Feuerstein in\nher words and tone.\n\n\"Let's have our game, Mr. Brauner,\" interrupted Otto.  \"All this can be\nsettled afterward.  Why spoil our afternoon?\"\n\nBrauner examined Mr. Feuerstein, who was posing as a statue of gloomy\nwrath.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he demanded in the insulting tone which exactly\nexpressed his state of mind.\n\nMr. Feuerstein cast up his eyes.  \"For Hilda's sake!\" he murmured\naudibly.  Then he made a great show of choking down his wrath.  \"I,\nsir, am of an ancient Prussian family--a gentleman. I saw your peerless\ndaughter, sought an introduction, careless who or what she was in birth\nand fortune.  Love, the leveler, had conquered me.  I--\"\n\n\"Do you work?\" Brauner broke in.  \"What are your prospects? What have\nyou got?  What's your character?  Have you any respectable friends who\ncan vouch for you?  You've wandered into the wrong part of town.  Down\nhere we don't give our daughters to strangers or do-nothings or\nrascals.  We believe in love--yes. But we also have a little common\nsense and  self-respect.\" Brauner flung this at Mr. Feuerstein in\nHigh-German.  Hilda, mortified and alarmed, was also proud that her\nfather was showing Mr. Feuerstein that she came of people who knew\nsomething, even if they were \"trades-folk.\"\n\n\"I can answer all your questions to your satisfaction,\" replied Mr.\nFeuerstein loftily, with a magnanimous wave of his white hand.  \"My\nfriends will speak for me.  And I shall give you the addresses of my\nnoble relatives in Germany, though I greatly fear they will oppose my\nmarriage.  You, sir, were born in the Fatherland.  You know their\nprejudices.\"\n\n\"Don't trouble yourself,\" said Brauner ironically.  \"Just take yourself\noff and spare yourself the disgrace of mingling with us plain folk.\nHilda, go to your room!\"  Brauner pointed the stem of his pipe toward\nthe outside door and looked meaningly at Mr. Feuerstein.\n\nHilda, her eyes sparkling and her cheeks flushed, put herself between\nMr. Feuerstein and the door.  \"I guess I've got something to say about\nthat!\" she exclaimed.  \"Father, you can't make me marry Otto Heilig.  I\nHATE him.  I guess this is a free country.  I shall marry Mr.\nFeuer--Carl.\"  She went up to him and put her arm through his and\nlooked up at him lovingly. He drew her to him protectingly, and for an\ninstant something of her passionate enthusiasm fired him, or rather,\nthe actor in him.\n\nOtto laid his hand on Brauner's arm.\n\n\"Don't you see, sir,\" he said in Low-German, very earnestly, \"that\nyou're driving her to him?  I beg you\"--in a lower tone--\"for the sake\nof her future--don't drive him out, and her with him.  If he really\nwould make her a good husband, why not let her have him?  If he's not\nwhat he claims, she won't have him.\"\n\nBrauner hesitated.  \"But she's yours.  Her mother and I have promised.\nWe are people of our word.\"\n\n\"But I won't marry her--not unless she wishes it, she herself. And\nnothing can be done until this man has had a chance.\"\n\nIt was evident from Brauner's face that he was yielding to this common\nsense.  Hilda looked at Otto gratefully.  \"Thank you, Otto,\" she said.\nHe shook his head mournfully and turned away.\n\nBrauner gave Mr. Feuerstein a contemptuous glance.  \"Perhaps Otto's\nright,\" he growled.  \"You can stay.  Let us have our game, Otto.\"\n\nMrs. Brauner hurried to the kitchen to make ready for four-o'clock\ncoffee and cake.  Hilda arranged the table for pinochle, and when her\nfather and Otto were seated, motioned her lover to a seat beside her on\nthe sofa.\n\n\"Heart's bride,\" he said in a low tone, \"I am prostrated by what I have\nborne for your sake.\"\n\n\"I love you,\" she said softly, her young eyes shining like Titania's\nwhen she was garlanding her ass-headed lover.  \"You were right, my\nbeloved.  We shall win--father is giving in.  He's very good-natured,\nand now he's used to the idea of our love.\"\n\nOtto lost the game, and, with his customary patience, submitted to the\ncustomary lecture on his stupidity as a player.  Brauner was once more\nin a good humor.  Having agreed to tolerate Mr. Feuerstein, he was\nalready taking a less unfavorable view of him. And Mr. Feuerstein laid\nhimself out to win the owner of three tenements.  He talked German\npolitics with him in High-German, and applauded his accent and his\nopinions.  He told stories of the old German Emperor and Bismarck, and\nfinally discovered that Brauner was an ardent admirer of Schiller.  He\nsaw a chance to make a double stroke--to please Brauner and to feed his\nown vanity.\n\n\"With your permission, sir,\" he said, \"I will give a soliloquy from\nWallenstein.\"\n\nBrauner went to the door leading down the private hall. \"Mother!\" he\ncalled.  \"Come at once.  Mr. Feuerstein's going to act.\"\n\nHilda was bubbling over with delight.  Otto sat forgotten in the\ncorner.  Mrs. Brauner came bustling, her face rosy from the kitchen\nfire and her hands moist from a hasty washing.  Mr. Feuerstein waited\nuntil all were seated in front of him.  He then rose and advanced with\nstately tread toward the clear space.  He rumpled his hair, drew down\nhis brows, folded his arms, and began a melancholy, princely pacing of\nthe floor.  With a suddenness that made them start, he burst out\nthunderously.  He strode, he roared, he rolled his eyes, he waved his\narms, he tore at his hair.  It was Wallenstein in a soul-sweat.  The\nfloor creaked, the walls echoed.  His ingenuous auditors, except Otto,\nlistened and looked with bated breath.  They were as vastly impressed\nas is a drawing-room full of culture-hunters farther up town when a man\ndiscourses to them on a subject of which he knows just enough for a\nwordy befuddling of their ignorance.  And the burst of applause which\ngreeted the last bellowing groan was full as hearty as that which\ngreets the bad singing or worse playing at the average musicale.\n\nSwollen with vanity and streaming with sweat, Mr. Feuerstein sat down.\n\"Good, Mr. Feuerstein--ah! it is grand!\" said Brauner. Hilda looked at\nher lover proudly.  Otto felt that the recitation was idiotic--\"Nobody\never carried on like that,\" he said to himself.  But he also felt the\npitiful truth, \"I haven't got a ghost of a chance.\"\n\nHe rose as soon as he could muster the courage.  \"I must get back and\nhelp Schwartz open up,\" he said, looking round forlornly.  \"It's five\no'clock.\"\n\n\"You must stay to coffee,\" insisted Mrs. Brauner.  It should have been\nserved before, but Mr. Feuerstein's exhibition had delayed it.\n\n\"No--I must work,\" he replied.  \"It's five o'clock.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Brauner with an approving nod.  \"Business first!\nI must go in myself--and you, too, Hilda.\"  The late Sunday afternoon\nopening was for a very important trade.\n\nHilda blushed--the descent from the romantic to the practical jarred\nupon her.  But Mr. Feuerstein rose and took leave  most graciously.\n\"May I return this evening?\" he said to Brauner.\n\n\"Always glad to see our friends,\" answered Brauner with a shamefaced,\napologetic look at Otto.\n\nAt seven o'clock that evening Otto, just closing his shop, saw Mr.\nFeuerstein and Hilda pass on their way toward Tompkins Square.  A few\nminutes later Sophie came along.  She paused and tried to draw him into\nconversation.  But he answered briefly and absently, gradually\nretreating into the darkness of his shop and pointedly drawing the door\nbetween him and her.  Sophie went on her way downcast, but not in the\nleast disheartened.  \"When Hilda is Mrs. Feuerstein,\" she said to\nherself.\n\n\n\nIV\n\nA BOLD DASH AND A DISASTER\n\nMr. Feuerstein's evening was even more successful than his afternoon.\nBrauner was still grumbling.  Mr. Feuerstein could not possibly be\nadjusted in his mind to his beloved ideals, his religion of\nlife--\"Arbeit und Liebe und Heim.\"  Still he was yielding and Hilda saw\nthe signs of it.  She knew he was practically won over and was secretly\ninclined to be proud that his daughter had made this exalted conquest.\nAll men regard that which they do not know either with extravagant awe\nor with extravagant contempt.  While Brauner had the universal human\nfailing for attaching too much importance to the department of human\nknowledge in which he was thoroughly at home, he had the American\nadmiration for learning, for literature, and instead of spelling them\nwith a very small \"l,\" as \"practical\" men sometimes do with age and\nincreasing vanity, he spelled them with huge capitals, erecting them\ninto a position out of all proportion to their relative importance in\nthe life of the human animal.\n\nMr. Feuerstein had just enough knowledge to enable him to play upon\nthis weakness, this universal human susceptibility to the poison of\npretense.  All doubt of success fled his mind, and he was free to\nindulge his vanity and his contempt for these simple, unpretending\npeople.  \"So vulgar!\" he said to himself, as he left their house that\nnight--he who knew how to do nothing of use or value.  \"It is a great\ncondescension for me.  Working people--ugh!\"\n\nAs he strolled up town he was spending in fancy the income from at\nleast two, perhaps all three, flat-houses--\"The shop's enough for the\nold people and that dumb ass of a brother.  I'll elevate the family.\nYes, I think I'll run away with Hilda to-morrow--that's the safest\nplan.\"\n\nOtto had guessed close to the truth about Feuerstein's affairs. They\nwere in a desperate tangle.  He had been discharged from the stock\ncompany on Saturday night.  He was worthless as an actor, and had the\nhostility of the management and of his associates. His landlady had got\nthe news promptly from a boarder who paid in part by acting as a sort\nof mercantile agency for her in watching her very uncertain boarders.\nShe had given him a week's notice, and had so arranged matters that if\nhe fled he could not take his meager baggage.  He was down to\neighty-five cents of a borrowed dollar.  He owed money everywhere in\nsums ranging from five dollars to twenty-five cents.  The most  of\nthese debts were in the form of half-dollar borrowings.  He had begun\nhis New York career with loans of \"five dollars until Thursday--I'm a\nlittle pressed.\"  Soon it became impossible for him to get more than a\ndollar at a time even from the women, except an occasional windfall\nthrough a weak or ignorant new acquaintance.  He clung tenaciously to\nthe fifty-cent basis--to go lower would cheapen him.  But for the last\ntwo weeks his regular levies had been of twenty-five cents, with not a\nfew descents to ten and even five cents.\n\nHe reached Goerwitz's at ten o'clock and promenaded slowly through both\nrooms twice.  Just as he was leaving he espied an acquaintance who was\nlooking fiercely away from him as if saying: \"I don't see you, and,\ndamn you, don't you dare see me!\"  But Feuerstein advanced boldly.\nTwelve years of active membership in that band of \"beats\" which patrols\nevery highway and byway and private way of civilization had thickened\nand toughened his skin into a hide.  \"Good evening, Albers,\" he said\ncordially, with a wave of the soft, light hat.  \"I see you have a\nvacant place in your little circle.  Thank you!\"  He assumed that\nAlbers had invited him, took a chair from another table and seated\nhimself. Social courage is one of the rarest forms of courage.  Albers\ngrew red but did not dare insult such a fine-looking fellow who seemed\nso hearty and friendly.  He surlily introduced Feuerstein to his\nfriends--two women and two men.  Feuerstein ordered a round of beer\nwith the air of a prince and without the slightest intention of paying\nfor it.\n\nThe young woman of the party was seated next to him.  Even before he\nsat he recognized her as the daughter of Ganser, a rich brewer of the\nupper East Side.  He had placed himself deliberately beside her, and he\nat once began advances.  She showed at a glance that she was a silly,\nvain girl.  Her face was fat and dull; she had thin, stringy hair.  She\nwas flabby and, in the lazy life to which the Gansers' wealth and the\nsilly customs of prosperous people condemned her, was already beginning\nto expand in the places where she could least afford it.\n\nHe made amorous eyes at her.  He laughed enthusiastically at her\nfoolish speeches.  He addressed his pompous platitudes exclusively to\nher.  Within an hour he pressed her hand under the table and sighed\ndramatically.  When she looked at him he started and rolled his great\neyes dreamily away.  Never before had she received attentions that were\nnot of the frankest and crudest practical nature.  She was all in a\nflutter at having thus unexpectedly come upon appreciation of the\nbeauties and merits her mirror told her she possessed.  When Mrs.\nSchoenberg, her aunt, rose to go, she gave Feuerstein a chance to say\nin a low aside:  \"My queen!  To-morrow at eleven--at Bloomingdale's.\"\nHer blush and smile told him she would be there.\n\nAll left except Feuerstein and a youth he had been watching out of the\ncorner of his eyes--young Dippel, son of the rich drug-store man.\nFeuerstein saw that Dippel was on the verge of collapse from too much\ndrink.  As he still had his eighty-five cents, he pressed Dippel to\ndrink and, by paying, induced him to add four glasses of beer to his\nalready top-heavy burden.\n\n\"Mus' go home,\" said Dippel at last, rising abruptly.\n\nFeuerstein walked with him, taking his arm to steady him. \"Let's have\none more,\" he said, drawing him into a saloon, gently pushing him to a\nseat at a table and ordering whisky. After the third large drink,\nDippel became helpless and maudlin and began to overflow with generous\nsentiments.  \"I love you, Finkelstern, ol' man,\" he declared tearfully.\n\"They say you're a dead beat, but wha' d'I care?\"\n\n\"Finkelstern,\" affecting drunkenness, shed tears on Dippel's shoulder,\ndenied that he was a \"beat\" and swore that he loved Dippel like a\nbrother.  \"You're my frien',\" he said.  \"I know you'd trust me to any\namount.\"\n\nDippel took from his trousers pocket a roll of bills several inches\nthick.  Feuerstein thrilled and his eyes grew eloquent as he noted tens\nand twenties and at least one fifty.  Slowly, and with exaggerated\ncare, Dippel drew off a ten.  \"There y'are, ol' dead beat,\" he said.\n\"I'll stake you a ten.  Lots more where that came from--soda-fountain\ncounter's reg'lar gol' mine.\"\n\nIn taking off the ten, he dropped a twenty.  It fluttered to the floor\nand the soldier of fortune, the scorner of toil and toilers, slid his\nfoot over it as swiftly and naturally as a true aristocrat always\ncovers an opportunity to get something somebody else has earned.  He\nput the ten in his pocket, when Dippel's eyes closed he stooped and\nretrieved the twenty with stealth--and skill.  When the twenty was\nhidden, and the small but typical operation in high finance was\ncomplete, he shook Dippel.  \"I say, old man,\" he said, \"hadn't you\nbetter let me keep your money for you?  I'm afraid you'll lose it.\"\n\nDippel slowly unclosed one eye and gave him a look of glassy cunning.\nHe again drew the roll from his pocket, and, clasping it tightly in his\nfist, waved it under Feuerstein's nose.  As he did it, he vented a\ndrunken chuckle.  \"Soda fountain's gol' mine, Fishenspiel,\" he said\nthickly.  \"No, you don't!  I can watch my own roll.\"  He winked and\nchuckled.\n\n\"Sorry to disappoint you, Fishy,\" he went on, with a leer. Then he took\noff another ten and handed it to Feuerstein.  \"Good fel', Fishy,\" he\nmumbled, \"'f y' are a dead beat.\"\n\nFeuerstein added the ten to the thirty and ordered more whisky. Dippel\ntried to doze, but he would not permit it.  \"He mustn't sleep any of it\noff,\" he thought.\n\nWhen the whisky came Dippel shook himself together and started up.\n\"G'-night,\" he said, trying to stand, look and talk straight.  \"Don't\nf'rget, y'owe me ten dollarses--no, two ten dollarses.\"\n\n\"Oh, sit down,\" coaxed Feuerstein, taking him by the arm. \"It's early\nyet.\"\n\nDippel shook him off with much dignity.  \"Don' touch me!\" he growled.\n\"I know what I'm 'bout.  I'm goin' home.\"  Then to himself, but aloud:\n\"Dippy, you're too full f'r utterance--you mus' shake this beat.\"\nAgain to Feuerstein:\n\n\"G'night, Mr. Funkelshine--g'night.  Sit there till I'm gone.\"\n\nFeuerstein rose to follow and Dippel struck at him.  The waiter seized\neach by the shoulder and flung them through the swinging doors.  Dippel\nfell in a heap on the sidewalk, but Feuerstein succeeded in keeping to\nhis feet.  He went to the assistance of Dippel.\n\n\"Don't touch me,\" shouted Dippel.\n\n\"Police!  Police!\"\n\nFeuerstein looked fearfully round, gave Dippel a kick and hurried away.\nWhen he glanced back from a safe distance Dippel was waving to and fro\non his wobbling legs, talking to a cabman.\n\n\"Close-fisted devil,\" muttered Feuerstein.  \"He couldn't forget his\nmoney even when he was drunk.  What good is money to a brute like him?\"\nAnd he gave a sniff of contempt for the vulgarity and meanness of\nDippel and his kind.\n\nEarly the next morning he established a modus vivendi with his landlady\nby giving her ten dollars on account.  He had an elaborate breakfast at\nTerrace Garden and went to Bloomingdale's, arriving at eleven\nprecisely.  Lena Ganser was already there, pretending to shop at a\ncounter in full view of the appointed place.  They went to Terrace\nGarden and sat in the Stube.  He at once opened up his sudden romantic\npassion.  \"All night I have walked the streets,\" he said, \"dreaming of\nyou.\"  When he had fully informed her of the state of his love-maddened\nmind toward her, he went on to his most congenial topic--himself.\n\n\"You have heard of the Freiherr von Feuerstein, the great soldier?\" he\nasked her.\n\nLena had never heard of him.  But she did not know who was German\nEmperor or even who was President of the United States.  She,\ntherefore, had to be extremely cautious.  She nodded assent.\n\n\"My uncle,\" said Feuerstein impressively.  His eyes became reflective.\n\"Strange!\" he exclaimed in tender accents, soliloquizing--\"strange\nwhere romance will lead us.  Instead of remaining at home, in ease and\nluxury, here am I--an actor--a wanderer--roaming the earth in search of\nthe heart that Heaven intended should be wedded to mine.\"  He fixed his\ngaze upon Lena's fat face with the expression that had made Hilda's\nsoul fall down and worship.  \"And--I have found it!\"  He drew in and\nexpelled a vast breath.  \"At last!  My soul is at rest.\"\n\nLena tried to look serious in imitation of him, but that was not her\nway of expressing emotion.  She made a brief struggle, then collapsed\ninto her own mode--a vain, delighted, giggling laugh.\n\n\"Why do you smile?\" he asked sternly.  He revolted from this discord to\nhis symphony.\n\nShe sobered with a frightened, deprecating look.  \"Don't mind me,\" she\npleaded.  \"Pa says I'm a fool.  I was laughing because I'm happy.\nYou're such a sweet, romantic dream of a man.\"\n\nFeuerstein was not particular either as to the quality or as to the\nsource of his vanity-food.  He accepted Lena's offering with a\ncondescending nod and smile.  They talked, or, rather, he talked and\nshe listened and giggled until lunch time.  As the room began to fill,\nthey left and he walked home with her.\n\n\"You can come in,\" she said.  \"Pa won't be home to lunch to-day and ma\nlets me do as I please.\"\n\nThe Gansers lived in East Eighty-first Street, in the regulation\ntwenty-five-foot brownstone house.  And within, also, it was of a\nfamiliar New York type.  It was  the home of the rich, vain ignoramus\nwho has not taste enough to know that those to whom he has trusted for\ntaste have shockingly betrayed him.  Ganser had begun as a teamster for\na brewery and had grown rapidly rich late in life.  He happened to be\nelected president of a big Verein and so had got the notion that he was\na person of importance and attainments beyond his fellows.  Too coarse\nand narrow and ignorant to appreciate the elevated ideals of democracy,\nhe reverted to the European vulgarities of rank and show.  He decided\nthat he owed it to himself and his family to live in the estate of\n\"high folks.\"  He bought a house in what was for him an\nultra-fashionable quarter, and called for bids to furnish it in the\nlatest style.  The results were even more regardless of taste than of\nexpense--carpets that fought with curtains, pictures that quarreled\nwith their frames and with the walls, upholstery so bellicose that it\nseemed perilous to sit upon.\n\nBut Feuerstein was as impressed as the Gansers had been the first time\nthey beheld the gorgeousness of their palace.  He looked about with a\nproprietary sense--\"I'll marry this little idiot,\" he said to himself.\n\"Maybe my nest won't be downy, and maybe I won't lie at my ease in it!\"\n\nHe met Mrs. Ganser and had the opportunity to see just what Lena would\nlook and be twenty years thence.  Mrs. Ganser moved with great\nreluctance and difficulty.  She did not speak unless forced and then\nher voice seemed to have felt its way up feebly through a long and\npainfully narrow passage, emerging thin, low and fainting.  When she\nsat--or, rather, AS she sat, for she was always sitting--her mountain\nof soft flesh seemed to be slowly collapsing upon and around the chair\nlike a lump of dough on a mold.  Her only interest in life was\ndisclosed when she was settled and settling at the luncheon table.  She\nused her knife more than her fork and her fingers more than either.\nFeuerstein left soon after luncheon, lingering only long enough to give\nLena a theatrical embrace.  \"Well, I'll not spend much time with those\nwomen, once I'm married,\" he reflected as he went down the steps; and\nhe thought of Hilda and sighed.\n\n\nThe next day but one he met Lena in the edge of the park and, after\ngloomy silence, shot with strange piercing looks that made her feel as\nif she were the heroine of a book, he burst forth with a demand for\nimmediate marriage.\n\n\"Forty-eight hours of torment!\" he cried.  \"I shall not leave you again\nuntil you are securely mine.\"\n\nHe proceeded to drop vague, adroit hints of the perils that beset a\nfascinating  actor's life, of the women that had come and gone in his\nlife.  And Lena, all a-tremble with jealous anxiety, was in the parlor\nof a Lutheran parsonage, with the minister reading out of the black\nbook, before she was quite aware that she and her cyclonic adorer were\nnot still promenading near the green-house in the park.  \"Now,\" said\nFeuerstein briskly, as they were once more in the open air, \"we'll go\nto your father.\"\n\n\"Goodness gracious, no,\" protested Lena.  \"You don't know him--he'll be\ncrazy--just crazy!  We must wait till he finds out about you--then\nhe'll be very proud.  He wanted a son-in-law of high social standing--a\ngentleman.\"\n\n\"We will go home, I tell you,\" replied Feuerstein firmly--his tone was\nnow the tone of the master.  All the sentiment was out of it and all\nthe hardness in it.\n\nLena felt the change without understanding it.  \"I bet you, pa'll make\nyou wish you'd taken my advice,\" she said sullenly.\n\nBut Feuerstein led her home.  They went up stairs where Mrs. Ganser was\nseated, looking stupidly at a new bonnet as she turned it slowly round\non one of her cushion-like hands.  Feuerstein went to her and kissed\nher on the hang of her cheek.  \"Mother!\" he said in a deep, moving\nvoice.\n\nMrs. Ganser blinked and looked helplessly at Lena.\n\n\"I'm married, ma,\" explained Lena.\n\n\"It's Mr. Feuerstein.\"  And she gave her silly laugh.\n\nMrs. Ganser grew slowly pale.  \"Your father,\" she at last succeeded in\narticulating.  \"Ach!\"  She lifted her arm, thick as a piano leg, and\nresumed the study of her new bonnet.\n\n\"Won't you welcome me, mother?\" asked Feuerstein, his tone and attitude\ndignified appeal.\n\nMrs. Ganser shook her huge head vaguely.  \"See Peter,\" was all she said.\n\nThey went down stairs and waited, Lena silent, Feuerstein pacing the\nroom and rehearsing, now aloud, now to himself, the scene he would\nenact with his father-in-law.  Peter was in a frightful humor that\nevening.  His only boy, who spent his mornings in sleep, his afternoons\nin speeding horses and his evenings in carousal, had come down upon him\nfor ten thousand dollars to settle a gambling debt.  Peter was willing\nthat his son should be a gentleman and should conduct himself like one.\nBut he had worked too hard for his money not to wince as a plain man at\nwhat he endured and even courted as a seeker after position for the\nhouse of Ganser.  He had hoped to be free to vent his ill-humor at\nhome.  He was therefore irritated by the discovery that an outsider was\nthere to check him.  As he came in he gave Feuerstein a look which said\nplainly:\n\n\"And who are you, and how long are you going to intrude yourself?\"\n\nBut Feuerstein, absorbed in the role he had so carefully thought out,\ndid not note his unconscious father-in-law's face.  He extended both\nhis hands and advanced grandly upon fat, round Peter.  \"My father!\" he\nexclaimed in his classic German. \"Forgive my unseemly haste in plucking\nwithout your permission the beautiful flower I found within reach.\"\n\nPeter stepped back and gave a hoarse grunt of astonishment.  His red\nface became redder as he glared, first at Feuerstein, then at Lena.\n\"What lunatic is this you've got here, daughter?\" he demanded.\n\n\"My father!\" repeated Feuerstein, drawing Lena to him.\n\nGanser's mouth opened and shut slowly  several times and his whiskers\nbristled.  \"Is this fellow telling the truth?\" he asked Lena in a tone\nthat made her shiver and shrink away from her husband.\n\nShe began to cry.  \"He made me do it, pa,\" she whined. \"I--I--\"\n\n\"Go to your mother,\" shouted Ganser, pointing his pudgy finger\ntremulously toward the door.  \"Move!\"\n\nLena, drying her eyes with her sleeve, fled.  Feuerstein became a\nsickly white.  When she had disappeared, Ganser looked at him with\ncruel little eyes that sparkled.  Feuerstein quailed.  It was full half\na minute before Ganser spoke.  Then he went up to Feuerstein, stood on\ntiptoe and, waving his arms frantically above his head, yelled into his\nface \"Rindsvieh!\"--as contemptuous an insult as one German can fling at\nanother.\n\n\"She is my lawful wife,\" said Feuerstein with an attempt at his pose.\n\n\"Get the house aus--quick!--aus!--gleich!--Lump!--I call the police!\"\n\n\"I demand my wife!\" exclaimed Feuerstein.\n\nGanser ran to the front door and opened it.  \"Out!\" he shrieked.  \"If\nyou don't, I have you taken in when the police come the block down.\nThis is my house!  Rindsvieh!\"\n\nFeuerstein caught up his soft hat from the hall table and hurried out.\nAs he passed, Ganser tried to kick him but failed ludicrously because\nhis short, thick leg would not reach.  At the bottom of the steps\nFeuerstein turned and waved his fists wildly. Ganser waved his fists at\nFeuerstein and, shaking his head so violently that his hanging cheeks\nflapped back and forth, bellowed:\n\n\"Rindsvieh! Dreck!\"\n\nThen he rushed in and slammed the door.\n\n\n\nV\n\nA SENSITIVE SOUL SEEKS SALVE\n\nAs Mr. Feuerstein left Hilda on the previous Sunday night he promised\nto meet her in Tompkins Square the next evening--at the band concert.\nShe walked up and down with Sophie, her spirits gradually sinking after\nhalf-past eight and a feeling of impending misfortune settling in\nclose.  She was not conscious of the music, though the second part of\nthe program contained the selections from Wagner which she loved best.\nShe feverishly searched the crowd and the half-darkness beyond.  She\nimagined that every approaching tall man was her lover.  With the\nfrankness to which she had been bred she made no concealment of her\nheart-sick anxiety.\n\n\"He may have to be at the theater,\" said Sophie, herself extremely\nuneasy. Partly through shrewdness, partly through her natural suspicion\nof strangers, she felt that Mr. Feuerstein, upon whom she was building,\nwas not a rock.\n\n\"No,\" replied Hilda.  \"He told me he wouldn't be at the theater, but\nwould surely come here.\"  The fact that her lover had said so settled\nit to her mind.\n\nThey did not leave the Square until ten o'clock, when it was almost\ndeserted and most of its throngs of an hour before were in bed sleeping\nsoundly in the content that comes from a life of labor.  And when she\ndid get to bed she lay awake for nearly an hour, tired though she was.\nWithout doubt some misfortune had befallen him--\"He's been hurt or is\nill,\" she decided.  The next morning she stood in the door of the shop\nwatching for the postman on his first round; as he turned the corner of\nSecond Street, she could not restrain herself, but ran to meet him.\n\n\"Any letter for me?\" she inquired in a voice that compelled him to feel\npersonal guilt in having to say \"No.\"\n\nIt was a day of mistakes in weights and in making up packages, a day of\nvain searching for some comforting explanation of Mr. Feuerstein's\nfailure and silence.  After supper Sophie came and they went to the\nSquare, keeping to the center of it where the lights were brightest and\nthe people fewest.\n\n\"I'm sure something's happened,\" said Sophie.  \"Maybe Otto has told him\na story--or has--\"\n\n\"No--not Otto.\"  Hilda dismissed the suggestion as impossible. She had\nknown Otto too long and too well to entertain for an instant the idea\nthat he could be underhanded.  \"There's only one reason--he's sick,\nvery sick--too sick to send word.\"\n\n\"Let's go and see,\" said Sophie, as if she had not planned it hours\nbefore.\n\nHilda hesitated.  \"It might look as if I--\"  She did not finish.\n\n\"But you needn't show yourself,\" replied Sophie.  \"You can wait down\nthe street and I'll go up to the door and won't give my name.\"\n\nHilda clasped her arm more tightly about Sophie's waist and they set\nout.  They walked more and more swiftly until toward the last they were\nalmost running.  At the corner of Fifteenth Street and First Avenue\nHilda stopped.  \"I'll go through to Stuyvesant Square,\" she said, \"and\nwait there on a bench near the Sixteenth Street entrance.  You'll be\nquick, won't you?\"\n\nSophie went to Mr. Feuerstein's number and rang.  After a long wait a\nslovenly girl in a stained red wrapper, her hair in curl-papers and one\nstocking down  about her high-heeled slipper, opened the door and said:\n\"What do you want?  I sent the maid for a pitcher of beer.\"\n\n\"I want to ask about Mr. Feuerstein,\" replied Sophie.\n\nThe girl's pert, prematurely-wrinkled face took on a quizzical smile.\n\"Oh!\" she said.  \"You can go up to his room.  Third floor, back.  Knock\nhard--he's a heavy sleeper.\"\n\nSophie climbed the stairs and knocked loudly.  \"Come!\" was the answer\nin German, in Mr. Feuerstein's deep stage-voice.\n\nShe opened the door a few inches and said through the crack: \"It's me,\nMr. Feuerstein--Sophie Liebers--from down in Avenue A--Hilda's friend.\"\n\n\"Come in,\" was Mr. Feuerstein's reply, in a weary voice, after a pause.\nFrom Ganser's he had come straight home and had been sitting there ever\nsince, depressed, angry, perplexed.\n\nSophie pushed the door wide and stood upon the threshold. \"Hilda's over\nin Stuyvesant Square,\" she said.  \"She thought you might be sick, so we\ncame.  But if you go to her, you must pretend you came by accident and\ndidn't see me.\"\n\nMr. Feuerstein reflected, but not so deeply that he neglected to pose\nbefore Sophie as a tragedy-king.  And it called for little pretense, so\ndesperate and forlorn was he feeling.  Should he go or should he send\nSophie about her business?  There was no hope that the rich brewer\nwould take him in; there was every reason to suspect that Peter would\narrange to have the marriage quietly annulled.  At most he could get a\nfew thousands, perhaps only hundreds, by threatening a scandal.  Yes,\nit would be wise, on the whole, to keep little Hilda on the string.\n\n\"I am very ill,\" he said gloomily, \"but I will go.\"\n\nSophie felt hopeful and energetic again.  \"I won't come up to her till\nyou leave her.\"\n\n\"You are a good girl--a noble creature.\"  Mr. Feuerstein took her hand\nand pretended to be profoundly moved by her friendship.\n\nSophie gave him a look of simplicity and warm-heartedness.  Her talent\nfor acting had not been spoiled by a stage experience. \"Hilda's my\nfriend,\" she said earnestly.  \"And I want to see her happy.\"\n\n\"Noble creature!\" exclaimed Mr. Feuerstein.  \"May God reward you!\"  And\nhe dashed his hand across his eyes.\n\nHe went to the mirror on his bureau, carefully arranged the yellow\naureole, carefully adjusted the soft light hat.  Then with feeble step\nhe descended the stairs.  As he moved down the street his face was\nmournful and his shoulders were drooped--a stage invalid.  When Hilda\nsaw him coming she started up and gave a little cry of delight; but as\nshe noted his woebegone appearance, a very real paleness came to her\ncheeks and very real tears to her great dark eyes.\n\nMr. Feuerstein sank slowly into the seat beside her.  \"Soul's wife,\" he\nmurmured. \"Ah--but I have been near to death.  The strain of the\ninterview with your father--the anguish--the hope--oh, what a curse it\nis to have a sensitive soul!  And my old trouble\"--he laid his hand\nupon his heart and slowly shook his head--\"returned.  It will end me\nsome day.\"\n\nHilda was trembling with sympathy.  She put her hand upon his. \"If you\nhad only sent word, dear,\" she said reproachfully, \"I would have come.\nOh--I do love you so, Carl!  I could hardly eat or sleep--and--\"\n\n\"The truth would have been worse than silence,\" he said in a hollow\nvoice.  He did not intend the double meaning of his remark; the Gansers\nwere for the moment out of his mind, which was absorbed in his acting.\n\"But it is over for the present--yes, over, my priceless pearl.  I can\ncome to see you soon.  If I am worse I shall send you word.\"\n\n\"But can't I come to see you?\"\n\n\"No, bride of my dreams.  It would not be--suitable.  We must respect\nthe little conventions.  You must wait until I come.\"\n\nHis tone was decided.  She felt that he knew best.  In a few minutes he\nrose.  \"I must return to my room,\" he said wearily. \"Ah, heart's\ndelight, it is terrible for a strong man to find himself thus weak.\nPity me.  Pray for me.\"\n\nHe noted with satisfaction her look of love and anxiety.  It was some\nslight salve to his cruelly wounded vanity.  He walked feebly away, but\nit was pure acting, as he no longer felt so downcast.  He had soon put\nHilda into the background and was busy with his plans for revenge upon\nGanser--\"a vulgar animal who insulted me when I honored him by marrying\nhis ugly gosling.\" Before he fell asleep that night he had himself\nwrought up to a state of righteous indignation.  Ganser had cheated,\nhad outraged him--him, the great, the noble, the eminent.\n\n\nEarly the next morning he went down to a dingy frame building that\ncowered meanly in the shadow of the Criminal Court House. He mounted a\ncreaking flight of stairs and went in at a low door on which \"Loeb,\nLynn, Levy and McCafferty\" was painted in black letters.  In the narrow\nentrance he brushed against a man on the way out, a man with a hangdog\nlook and short bristling hair and the pastily-pallid skin that comes\nfrom living long away from the sunlight.  Feuerstein shivered\nslightly--was it at the touch of such a creature or at the suggestions\nhis appearance started?  In front of him was a ground-glass partition\nwith five doors in it. At a dirty greasy pine table sat a boy--one of\nthose child veterans the big city develops.  He had a long and\nextremely narrow head.  His eyes were close together, sharp and shifty.\nHis expression was sophisticated and cynical.  \"Well, sir!\" he said\nwith curt impudence, giving Feuerstein a gimlet-glance.\n\n\"I want to see Mr. Loeb.\"  Feuerstein produced a card--it was one of\nhis last remaining half-dozen and was pocket-worn.\n\nThe office boy took it with unveiled sarcasm in his eyes and in the\ncorners of his mouth.  He disappeared through one of the five doors,\nalmost immediately reappeared at another, closed it mysteriously behind\nhim and went to a third door.  He  threw it open and stood aside.  \"At\nthe end of the hall,\" he said. \"The door with Mr. Loeb's name on it.\nKnock and walk right in.\"\n\nFeuerstein followed the directions and found himself in a dingy little\nroom, smelling of mustiness and stale tobacco, and lined with law\nbooks, almost all on crime and divorce.  Loeb, Lynn, Levy and\nMcCafferty were lawyers to the lower grades of the criminal and shady\nonly.  They defended thieves and murderers; they prosecuted or defended\nscandalous divorce cases; they packed juries and suborned perjury and\nthey tutored false witnesses in the way to withstand cross-examination.\nIn private life they were four home-loving, law-abiding citizens.\n\nLoeb looked up from his writing and said with contemptuous cordiality:\n\"Oh--Mr. Feuerstein.  Glad to see you--AGAIN. What's the trouble--NOW?\"\n\nAt \"again\" and \"now\" Feuerstein winced slightly.  He looked nervously\nat Loeb.\n\n\"It's been--let me see--at least seven years since I saw you,\"\ncontinued Loeb, who was proud of his amazing memory.  He was a squat,\nfat man, with a coarse brown skin and heavy features.  He was carefully\ngroomed and villainously perfumed and his clothes were in the extreme\nof the loudest fashion.  A diamond of great size was in his bright-blue\nscarf; another, its match, loaded down his fat little finger.  Both\ncould be unscrewed and set in a hair ornament which his wife wore at\nfirst nights or when they dined in state at Delmonico's.  As he studied\nFeuerstein, his face had its famous smile, made by shutting his teeth\ntogether and drawing his puffy lips back tightly from them.\n\n\"That is all past and gone,\" said Feuerstein.  \"As a lad I was saved by\nyou from the consequences of boyish folly.  And now, a man grown, I\ncome to you to enlist your aid in avenging an insult to my honor, an--\"\n\n\"Be as brief as possible,\" cut in Loeb.  \"My time is much occupied.\nThe bald facts, please--FACTS, and BALD.\"\n\nFeuerstein settled himself and prepared to relate his story as if he\nwere on the stage, with the orchestra playing low and sweet. \"I met a\nwoman and loved her,\" he began in a deep, intense voice with a\npassionate tremolo.\n\n\"A bad start,\" interrupted Loeb.  \"If you go on that way, we'll never\nget anywhere.  You're a frightful fakir and liar, Feuerstein.  You\nwere, seven years ago; of course, the habit's grown on you.  Speak out!\nWhat do you want?  As your lawyer, I must know things exactly as they\nare.\"\n\n\"I ran away with a girl--the daughter  of the brewer, Peter Ganser,\"\nsaid Feuerstein, sullen but terse.  \"And her father wouldn't receive\nme--shut her up--put me out.\"\n\n\"And you want your wife?\"\n\n\"I want revenge.\"\n\n\"Of course--cash.  Well, Ganser's a rich man.  I should say he'd give\nup a good deal to get rid of YOU.\"  Loeb gave that mirthless and\nmirth-strangling smile as he accented the \"you.\"\n\n\"He's got to give up!\" said Feuerstein fiercely.\n\n\"Slowly!  Slowly!\" Loeb leaned forward and looked into Feuerstein's\nface.  \"You mustn't forget.\"\n\nFeuerstein's eyes shifted rapidly as he said in a false voice: \"She got\na divorce years ago.\"\n\n\"M-m-m,\" said Loeb.\n\n\"Anyhow, she's away off in Russia.\"\n\n\"I don't want you to confess a crime you haven't come to me about,\"\nsaid Loeb, adding with peculiar emphasis:  \"Of course, if we KNEW you\nwere still married to the Mrs. Feuerstein of seven years ago we\ncouldn't take the present case.  As it is--the best way is to bluff the\nold brewer.  He doesn't want publicity; neither do you.  But you know\nhe doesn't, and he doesn't know that you love quiet.\"\n\n\"Ganser treated me infamously.  He must sweat for it.  I'm nothing if\nnot a good hater.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" said Loeb dryly.  \"And you have rights which the law\nsafeguards.\"\n\n\"What shall I do?\"\n\n\"Leave that to us.  How much do you want--how much damages?\"\n\n\"He ought to pay at least twenty-five thousand.\"\n\nLoeb shrugged his shoulders.  \"Ridiculous!\" he said. \"Possibly the five\nwithout the twenty.  And how do you expect to pay us?\"\n\n\"I'm somewhat pressed just at the moment.  But I thought\"--Feuerstein\nhalted.\n\n\"That we'd take the case as a speculation?  Well, to oblige an old\nclient, we will.  But you must agree to give us all we can get over and\nabove five thousand--half what we get if it's below that.\"\n\n\"Those are hard terms,\" remonstrated Feuerstein.  The more he had\nthought on his case, the larger his expectations had become.\n\n\"Very generous terms, in the circumstances.  You can take it or leave\nit.\"\n\n\"I can't do anything without you.  I accept.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"  Loeb took up his pen, as if he were done with Feuerstein,\nbut went on:  \"And you're SURE that the--the FORMER Mrs. Feuerstein is\ndivorced--and won't turn up?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.  She swore she'd never enter any country where I was.\"\n\n\"Has she any friends who are likely to hear of this?\"\n\n\"She knew no one here.\"\n\n\"All right.  Go into the room to the left there.  Mr. Travis or Mr.\nGordon will take your statement of the facts--names, dates, all\ndetails.  Good morning.\"\n\nFeuerstein went to Travis, small and sleek, smooth and sly.  When\nTravis had done with him, he showed him out.  \"Call day after\nto-morrow,\" he said, \"and when you come, ask for me.  Mr. Loeb never\nbothers with these small cases.\"\n\nTravis reported to Loeb half an hour later, when Feuerstein's statement\nhad been typewritten.  Loeb read the statement through twice with great\ncare.\n\n\"Most complete, Mr. Travis,\" was his comment.  \"You've done a good\npiece of work.\"  He sat silent, drumming noiselessly on the table with\nhis stumpy, hairy, fat fingers.  At last he began: \"It ought to be\nworth at least twenty thousand.  Do you know Ganser?\"\n\n\"Just a speaking acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Excellent.  What kind of a man is he?\"\n\n\"Stupid and ignorant, but not without a certain cunning.  We can get at\nhim all right, though.  He's deadly afraid of social scandal.  Wants to\nget into the German Club and become a howling swell.  But he don't\nstand a chance, though he don't know it.\"\n\n\"You'd better go to see him yourself,\" said Loeb.\n\n\"I'll be glad to do it, Mr. Loeb.  Isn't your man--this Feuerstein--a\ngood bit to the queer?\"\n\n\"A dead beat--one of the worst kind--the born gentleman.  You've\nnoticed, perhaps, that where a man or woman has been brought up to live\nwithout work, to live  off other people's work, there's nothing they\nwouldn't stoop to, to keep on living that way.  As for this chap, if he\nhad got started right, he'd be operating up in the Fifth Avenue\ndistrict.  He used to have a wife.  He SAYS he's divorced.\"\n\nLoeb and Travis looked each at the other significantly.  \"I see,\" said\nTravis.\n\n\"Neither side wants scandal.  Still, I think you're right, that\nGanser's good for twenty thousand.\"\n\n\"You can judge better after you've felt him,\" replied Loeb. \"You'd\nbetter go at once.  Give him the tip that Feuerstein's about to force\nhim to produce his daughter in court.  But you understand.  Try to\ninduce him to go to Beck.\"  Travis grinned and Loeb's eyes twinkled.\n\"You might lay it on strong about Feuerstein's actor-craze for getting\ninto the papers.\"\n\n\"That's a grand idea,\" exclaimed Travis.  \"I don't think I'll suggest\nany  sum if he agrees to go to Beck.  Beck can get at least five\nthousand more out of him than any other lawyer in town.\"\n\n\"Beck's the wonder,\" said Loeb.\n\n\"LOEB and Beck,\" corrected Travis in a flattering tone.\n\nLoeb waved his hot, fat head gently to and fro as if a pleasant cooling\nstream were being played upon it.  \"I think I have got a 'pretty good\nnut on me,' as John L. used to say,\" he replied. \"I think I do know a\nlittle about the law.  And now hustle yourself, my boy.  This case must\nbe pushed.  The less time Ganser has to look about, the better for--our\nclient.\"\n\n\nTravis found Ganser in his office at the brewery.  The old man's face\nwas red and troubled.\n\n\"I've come on very unpleasant business, Mr. Ganser,\" said Travis with\ndeference.  \"As you know, I am with Loeb, Lynn, Levy and McCafferty.\nOur client, Mr. Feuerstein--\"\n\nGanser leaped to his feet, apoplectic.\n\n\"Get out!\" he shouted, \"I don't speak with you!\"\n\n\"As an officer of the court, Mr. Ganser,\" said Travis suavely, \"it is\nmy painful duty to insist upon a hearing.  We lawyers can't select our\nclients.  We must do our best for all comers. Our firm has sent me out\nof kindly feeling for you.  We are all men of family, like yourself,\nand, when the case was forced on us, we at once tried to think how we\ncould be of service to you--of course, while doing our full legal duty\nby our client. I've come in the hope of helping you to avoid the\ndisgrace of publicity.\"\n\n\"Get out!\" growled Peter.  \"I know lawyers--they're all thieves.  Get\nout!\"  But Travis knew that Peter wished him to stay.\n\n\"I needn't enlarge on our client--Mr. Feuerstein.  You know he's an\nactor.  You know how they crave notoriety.  You know how eager the\nnewspapers are to take up and make a noise about matters of this kind.\"\n\nPeter was sweating profusely, and had to seat himself.  \"It's\noutrageous!\" he groaned in German.\n\n\"Feuerstein has ordered us to have your daughter brought into court at\nonce--to-morrow.  He's your daughter's lawful husband and she's well\nbeyond the legal age.  Of course, he can't compel her to live with him\nor you to support him.  But he can force the courts to inquire\npublicly.  And I'm sorry to say we'll not be able to restrain him or\nthe press, once he gets the ball to rolling.\"\n\nPeter felt it rolling over him, tons heavy.  \"What you talk about?\" he\nsaid, on his guard but eager.\n\n\"It's an outrage that honest men should be thus laid open to attack,\"\ncontinued Travis in a sympathetic tone.  \"But if the law permits these\noutrages, it also provides remedies.  Your daughter's mistake may cost\nyou a little something, but there need be no scandal.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" asked Ganser.\n\n\"Really, I've talked too much already, Mr. Ganser.  I almost forgot,\nfor the moment, that I'm representing Mr. Feuerstein. But, as between\nfriends, I'd advise you to go to some good divorce lawyers--a firm that\nis reputable but understands the ins and outs of the business, some\nfirm like Beck and Brown.  They can tell you exactly what to do.\"\n\nGanser regarded his \"friend\" suspiciously but credulously. \"I'll see,\"\nhe said.  \"But I won't pay a cent.\"\n\n\"Right you are, sir!  And there may be a way out of it without paying.\nBut Beck can tell you.\"  Travis made a motion toward the inside pocket\nof his coat, then pretended to change his mind. \"I came here to serve\nthe papers on you,\" he said apologetically.  \"But I'll take the\nresponsibility of delaying--it can't make Feuerstein any less married,\nand your daughter's certainly safe in her father's care.  I'll wait in\nthe hope that YOU'LL take the first step.\"\n\nGanser lost no time in going to his own lawyers--Fisher, Windisch and\nCarteret, in the Postal Telegraph Building.  He told Windisch the whole\nstory.  \"And,\" he ended, \"I've got a detective looking up the rascal.\nHe's a wretch--a black wretch.\"\n\n\"We can't take your case, Mr. Ganser,\" said Windisch.  \"It's wholly out\nof our line.  We don't do that kind of work.  I should say Beck and\nBrown were your people.  They stand well, and at the same time they\nknow all the tricks.\"\n\n\"But they may play me the tricks.\"\n\n\"I think not.  They stand well at the bar.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" sneered Peter, who was never polite, was always insultingly\nfrank to any one who served him for pay.  \"I know that bar.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Ganser,\" replied Windisch, angry but willing to take almost\nanything from a rich client, \"I guess you can look out for yourself.\nOf course there's always danger, once you get outside the straight\ncourse of justice.  As I understand it, your main point is no\npublicity?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" replied Ganser.  \"No newspapers--no trial.\"\n\n\"Then Beck and Brown.  Drive as close a bargain as you can.  But you'll\nhave to give up a few thousands, I'm afraid.\"\n\nGanser went over into Nassau Street  and found Beck in his office.  He\ngazed with melancholy misgivings at this lean man with hair and\nwhiskers of a lifeless black.  Beck suggested a starved black spider,\nespecially when you were looking into his cold, amused, malignant black\neyes.  He made short work of the guileless brewer, who was dazed and\nfrightened by the meshes in which he was enveloped.  Staring at the\nhorrid specter of publicity which these men of craft kept before him,\nhe could not vigorously protest against extortion.  Beck discovered\nthat twenty thousand was his fighting limit.\n\n\"Leave the matter entirely in our hands,\" said Beck.  \"We'll make the\nbest bargain we can.  But Feuerstein has shrewd lawyers--none better.\nThat man Loeb--\"  Beck threw up his arms. \"Of course,\" he continued, \"I\nhad to know your limit.  I'll try to make the business as cheap for you\nas possible.\"\n\n\"Put 'em off,\" said Ganser.  \"My Lena's sick.\"\n\nHis real reason was his hopes from the reports on Feuerstein's past,\nwhich his detective would make.  But he thought it was not necessary to\ntell Beck about the detective.\n\n\n\nVI\n\nTRAGEDY IN TOMPKINS SQUARE\n\nAfter another talk with Travis, Feuerstein decided that he must give up\nHilda entirely until this affair with the Gansers was settled.\nAfterward--well, there would be time to decide when he had his five\nthousand.  He sent her a note, asking her to meet him in Tompkins\nSquare on Friday evening.  That afternoon he carefully prepared\nhimself.  He resolved that the scene between her and him should be, so\nfar as his part was concerned, a masterpiece of that art of which he\nknew himself to be one of the greatest living exponents.  Only his own\nelegant languor had prevented the universal recognition of this and his\ntriumph over the envy of professionals and the venality of critics.\n\nIt was a concert night in Tompkins Square, and Hilda, off from her work\nfor an hour, came alone through the crowds to meet him. She made no\neffort to control the delight in her eyes and in her voice.  She loved\nhim; he loved her.  Why suppress and deny?  Why not glory in the\nglorious truth?  She loved him, not because he was her conquest, but\nbecause she was his.\n\nMr. Feuerstein was so absorbed in his impending \"act\" that he barely\nnoted how pretty she was and how utterly in love--what was there\nremarkable in a woman being in love with him?  \"The women are all crazy\nabout me,\" was his inward comment whenever a woman chanced to glance at\nhim.  As he took Hilda's hand he gave her a look of intense, yearning\nmelancholy.  He sighed deeply.  \"Let us go apart,\" he said.  Then he\nglanced gloomily round and sighed again.\n\nThey seated themselves on a bench far away from the music and the\ncrowds.  He did not speak but repeated his deep sigh.\n\n\"Has it made you worse to come, dear?\" Hilda asked anxiously. \"Are you\nsick?\"\n\n\"Sick?\" he said in a hollow voice.  \"My soul is sick--dying. My God!\nMy God!\" An impressive pause.  \"Ah, child, you do not know what\nsuffering is--you who have lived only in these simple, humble\nsurroundings.\"\n\nHilda was trembling with apprehension.  \"What is it, Carl?  You can\ntell me.  Let me help you bear it.\"\n\n\"No! no! I must bear it alone.  I must take my dark shadow from your\nyoung life.  I ought not to have come.  I should have fled. But love\nmakes me a coward.\"\n\n\"But I love you, Carl,\" she said gently.\n\n\"And I have missed you--dreadfully, dreadfully!\"\n\nHe rolled his eyes wildly.  \"You torture  me!\" he exclaimed, seizing\nher hand in a dead man's clutch.  \"How CAN I speak?\"\n\nHilda's heart seemed to stand still.  She was pale to the lips, and he\ncould see, even in the darkness, her eyes grow and startle.\n\n\"What is it?\" she murmured.  \"You know I--can bear anything for you.\"\n\n\"Not that tone,\" he groaned.  \"Reproach me!  Revile me!  Be harsh,\nscornful--but not those tender accents.\"\n\nHe felt her hand become cold and he saw terror in her eyes. \"Forgive\nme,\" she said humbly.  \"I don't know what to say or do.  I--you look so\nstrange.  It makes me feel all queer inside. Won't you tell me, please?\"\n\nHe noted with artistic satisfaction that the band was playing\npassionate love-music with sobs and sad ecstasies of farewell embraces\nin it.  He kissed her, then drew back.  \"No,\" he groaned.  \"Those lips\nare not for me, accursed that I am.\"\n\nShe was no longer looking at him, but sat gazing straight ahead, her\nshoulders bent as if she were crouching to receive a blow. He began in\na low voice, and, as he spoke, it rose or fell as his words and the\ndistant music prompted him.  \"Mine has been a luckless life,\" he said.\n\"I have been a football of destiny, kicked and flung about, hither and\nyon.  Again and again I have thought in my despair to lay me down and\ndie.  But something has urged me on, on, on.  And at last I met you.\"\n\nHe paused and groaned--partly because it was the proper place, partly\nwith vexation.  Here was a speech to thrill, yet she sat there inert,\nher face a stupid blank.  He was not even sure that she had heard.\n\n\"Are you listening?\" he asked in a stern aside, a curious mingling of\nthe actor and the stage manager.\n\n\"I--I don't know,\" she answered, startling.  \"I feel so--so--queer.  I\ndon't seem to be able to pay attention.\"  She looked at him timidly and\nher chin quivered.  \"Don't you love me any more?\"\n\n\"Love you?  Would that I did not!  But I must on--my time is short.\nHow can you say I do not love you when my soul is like a raging fire?\"\n\nShe shook her head slowly.  \"Your voice don't feel like it,\" she said.\n\"What is it?  What are you going to say?\"\n\nHe sighed and looked away from her with an irritated expression.\n\"Little stupid!\" he muttered--she didn't appreciate him and he was a\nfool to expect it.  But \"art for art's sake\"; and he went on in tones\nof gentle melancholy.  \"I love you, but fate has again caught me up.  I\nam being whirled away.  I stretch out my arms to you--in vain.  Do you\nunderstand?\"  It exasperated him for her to be so still--why didn't she\nweep?\n\nShe shook her head and replied quietly:\n\n\"No--what is it?  Don't you love me any more?\"\n\n\"Love has nothing to do with it,\" he said, as gently as he could in the\nirritating circumstances.  \"My mysterious destiny has--\"\n\n\"You said that before,\" she interrupted.  \"What is it?  Can't you tell\nme so that I can understand?\"\n\n\"You never loved me!\" he cried bitterly.\n\n\"You know that isn't so,\" she answered.  \"Won't you tell me, Carl?\"\n\n\"A specter has risen from my past--I must leave you--I may never\nreturn--\"\n\nShe gave a low, wailing cry--it seemed like an echo of the music. Then\nshe began to sob--not loudly, but in a subdued, despairing way.  She\nwas not conscious of her grief, but only of his words--of the dream\nvanished, the hopes shattered.\n\n\"Never?\" she said brokenly.\n\n\"Never!\" he replied in a hoarse whisper.\n\nMr. Feuerstein looked down at Hilda's quivering shoulders with\nsatisfaction.  \"I thought I could make even her feel,\" he said to\nhimself complacently.  Then to her in the hoarse undertone: \"And my\nheart is breaking.\"\n\nShe straightened and her tears seemed to dry with the flash of her\neyes.  \"Don't say that--you mustn't!\"  She blazed out before his\nastonished eyes, a woman electric with disdain and anger.  \"It's\nfalse--false!  I hate you--hate you--you never cared--you've made a\nfool of me--\"\n\n\"Hilda!\"  He felt at home now and his voice became pleading and\nanguished.  \"You, too, desert me!  Ah, God, whenever was there man so\nwretched as I?\"  He buried his face in his hands.\n\n\"Oh, you put it on well,\" she scoffed.  \"But I know what it all means.\"\n\nMr. Feuerstein rose wearily.  \"Farewell,\" he said in a broken voice.\n\"At least I am glad you will be spared the suffering that is blasting\nmy life.  Thank God, she did not love me!\"\n\nThe physical fact of his rising to go struck her courage full in the\nface.\n\n\"No--no,\" she urged hurriedly, \"not yet--not just yet--wait a few\nminutes more--\"\n\n\"No--I must go--farewell!\"  And he seated himself beside her, put his\narm around her.\n\nShe lay still in his arms for a moment, then murmured:  \"Say it isn't\nso, Carl--dear!\"\n\n\"I would say there is hope, heart's darling,\" he whispered, \"but I have\nno right to blast your young life.  And I may never return.\"\n\nShe started up, her face glowing.\n\n\"Then you WILL return?\"\n\n\"It may be that I can,\" he answered.  \"But--\"\n\n\"Then I'll wait--gladly.  No matter how long it is, I'll wait. Why\ndidn't you say at first, 'Hilda, something I can't tell you about has\nhappened.  I must go away.  When I can, I'll come.' That would have\nbeen enough, because I--I love you!\"\n\n\"What have I done to deserve such love as this!\" he exclaimed, and for\nan instant he almost forgot himself in her beauty and sweetness and\nsincerity.\n\n\"Will it be long?\" she asked after a while.\n\n\"I hope not, bride of my soul.  But I can not--dare not say.\"\n\n\"Wherever you go, and no matter what happens, dear,\" she said softly,\n\"you'll always know that I'm loving you, won't you?\" And she looked at\nhim with great, luminous, honest eyes.\n\nHe began to be uncomfortable.  Her  complete trust was producing an\neffect even upon his nature.  The good that evil can never kill out of\na man was rousing what was very like a sense of shame.  \"I must go\nnow,\" he said with real gentleness in his voice and a look at her that\nhad real longing in it.  He went on: \"I shall come as soon as the\nshadow passes--I shall come soon, Herzallerliebste!\"\n\nShe was cheerful to the last.  But after he had left she sat\nmotionless, except for an occasional shiver.  From the music-stand came\na Waldteufel waltz, with its ecstatic throb and its long, dreamy swing,\nits mingling of joy with foreboding of sadness.  The tears streamed\ndown her cheeks.  \"He's gone,\" she said miserably.  She rose and went\nthrough the crowd, stumbling against people, making the homeward\njourney by instinct alone. She seemed to be walking in her sleep.  She\nentered the shop--it was crowded with  customers, and her father, her\nmother and August were bustling about behind the counters.  \"Here, tie\nthis up,\" said her father, thrusting into her hands a sheet of wrapping\npaper on which were piled a chicken, some sausages, a bottle of olives\nand a can of cherries.  She laid the paper on the counter and went on\nthrough the parlor and up the stairs to her plain, neat, little\nbedroom.  She threw herself on the bed, face downward.  She fell at\nonce into a deep sleep.  When she awoke it was beginning to dawn.  She\nremembered and began to moan.  \"He's gone!  He's gone!  He's gone!\" she\nrepeated over and over again.  And she lay there, sobbing and calling\nto him.\n\nWhen she faced the family there were black circles around her eyes.\nThey were the eyes of a woman grown, and they looked out upon the world\nwith sorrow in them for the first time.\n\n\n\nVII\n\nLOVE IN SEVERAL ASPECTS\n\nIt was not long before the community was talking of the change in\nHilda, the abrupt change to a gentle, serious, silent woman, the\nsparkle gone from her eyes, pathos there in its stead.  But not even\nher own family knew her secret.\n\n\"When is Mr. Feuerstein coming again?\" asked her father when a week had\npassed.\n\n\"I don't know just when.  Soon,\" answered Hilda, in a tone which made\nit impossible for such a man as he to inquire further.\n\nSophie brought all her cunning to bear in her effort to get at the\nfacts.  But Hilda evaded her hints and avoided her traps. After much\nthinking she decided  that Mr. Feuerstein had probably gone for good,\nthat Hilda was hoping when there was nothing to hope for, and that her\nown affairs were suffering from the cessation of action.  She was in\nthe mood to entertain the basest suggestions her craft could put\nforward for making marriage between Hilda and Otto impossible.  But she\nhad not yet reached the stage at which overt acts are deliberately\nplanned upon the surface of the mind.\n\nOne of her girl friends ran in to gossip with her late in the afternoon\nof the eighth day after Mr. Feuerstein's \"parting scene\" in Tompkins\nSquare.  The talk soon drifted to Hilda, whom the other girl did not\nlike.\n\n\"I wonder what's become of that lover of hers--that tall fellow from up\ntown?\" asked Miss Hunneker.\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Sophie in a strained, nervous manner. \"I always\nhated to see Hilda go with him.  No good ever comes of that sort of\nthing.\"\n\n\"I supposed she was going to marry him.\"\n\nSophie became very uneasy indeed.  \"It don't often turn out that way,\"\nshe said in a voice that was evidently concealing something--apparently\nan ugly rent in the character of her friend.\n\nWalpurga Hunneker opened her eyes wide.  \"You don't mean--\" she\nexclaimed.  And, as Sophie looked still more confused,\n\n\"Well, I THOUGHT so!  Gracious!  Her pride must have had a fall. No\nwonder she looks so disturbed.\"\n\n\"Poor Hilda!\" said Sophie mournfully.  Then she looked at Walpurga in a\nfrightened way as if she had been betrayed into saying too much.\n\nWalpurga spent a busy evening among her confidantes, with the result\nthat the next day the neighborhood was agitated  by\ngossip--insinuations that grew bolder and bolder, that had sprung from\nnowhere, but pointed to Hilda's sad face as proof of their truth.  And\non the third day they had reached Otto's mother.  Not a detail was\nlacking--even the scene between Hilda and her father was one of the\nseveral startling climaxes of the tale.  Mrs. Heilig had been bitterly\nresentful of Hilda's treatment of her son, and she accepted the\nstory--it was in such perfect harmony with her expectations from the\nmoment she heard of Mr. Feuerstein.  In the evening, when he came home\nfrom the shop, she told him.\n\n\"There isn't a word of truth in it, mother,\" he said.  \"I don't care\nwho told you, it's a lie.\"\n\n\"Your love makes you blind,\" answered the mother.  \"But I can see that\nher vanity has led her just where vanity always leads--to destruction.\"\n\n\"Who told you?\" he demanded.\n\nMrs. Heilig gave him the names of several women.  \"It is known to all,\"\nshe said.\n\nHis impulse was to rush out and trace down the lie to its author. But\nhe soon realized the folly of such an attempt.  He would only aggravate\nthe gossip and the scandal, give the scandal-mongers a new chapter for\ntheir story.  Yet he could not rest without doing something.\n\nHe went to Hilda--she had been most friendly toward him since the day\nhe helped her with her lover.  He asked her to walk with him in the\nSquare.  When they were alone, he began:  \"Hilda, you believe I'm your\nfriend, don't you?\"\n\nShe looked as if she feared he were about to reopen the old subject.\n\n\"No--I'm not going to worry you,\" he said in answer to the look.  \"I\nmean just friend.\"\n\n\"I know you are, Otto,\" she replied  with tears in her eyes. \"You are\nindeed my friend.  I've counted on you ever since you--ever since that\nSunday.\"\n\n\"Then you won't think wrong of me if I ask you a question? You'll know\nI wouldn't, if I didn't have a good reason, even though I can't\nexplain?\"\n\n\"Yes--what is it?\"\n\n\"Hilda, is--is Mr. Feuerstein coming back?\"\n\nHilda flushed.  \"Yes, Otto,\" she said.  \"I haven't spoken to any one\nabout it, but I can trust you.  He's had trouble and it has called him\naway.  But he told me he'd come back.\"  She looked at him appealingly.\n\"You know that I love him, Otto. Some day you will like him, will see\nwhat a noble man he is.\"\n\n\"When is he coming back?\"\n\n\"I didn't ask him.  I knew he'd come as soon as he could.  I wouldn't\npry into his affairs.\"\n\n\"Then you don't know why he went or when he's coming?\"\n\n\"I trust him, just as you'll want a girl to trust you some day when you\nlove her.\"\n\nAs soon as he could leave her, he went up town, straight to the German\nTheater.  In the box-office sat a young man with hair precisely parted\nin the middle and sleeked down in two whirls brought low on his\nforehead.\n\n\"I'd like to get Mr. Feuerstein's address,\" said Otto.\n\n\"That dead-beat?\" the young man replied contemptuously.  \"I suppose he\ngot into you like he did into every one else.  Yes, you can have his\naddress.  And give him one for me when you catch him.  He did me out of\nten dollars.\"\n\nOtto went on to the boarding-house in East Sixteenth Street.  No, Mr.\nFeuerstein was not in and it was not known when he would return--he was\nvery uncertain.  Otto went to Stuyvesant Square and seated himself\nwhere he could see the stoop of the boarding-house.  An hour, two\nhours, two hours and a half passed, and then his patient attitude\nchanged abruptly to action.  He saw the soft light hat and the yellow\nbush coming toward him.  Mr. Feuerstein paled slightly as he recognized\nOtto.\n\n\"I'm not going to hurt you,\" said Otto in a tone which Mr. Feuerstein\nwished he had the physical strength to punish.  \"Sit down here--I've\ngot something to say to you.\"\n\n\"I'm in a great hurry.  Really, you'll have to come again.\"\n\nBut Otto's look won.  Mr. Feuerstein hesitated, seated himself.\n\n\"I want to tell you,\" said Otto quietly, \"that as the result of your\ngoing away so suddenly and not coming back a wicked lying story is\ngoing round about Hilda.  She does not know it yet, but it won't be\nlong before something will be said--maybe publicly.  And it will break\nher heart.\"\n\n\"I can't discuss her with you,\" said Mr. Feuerstein. \"Doubtless you\nmean well.  I'm obliged to you for coming.  I'll see.\"  He rose.\n\n\"Is that all?\" said Otto.\n\n\"What more can I say?\"\n\n\"But what are you going to DO?\"\n\n\"I don't see how I can prevent a lot of ignorant people from gossiping.\"\n\n\"Then you're not going straight down there?  You're not going to do\nwhat a man'd do if he had the decency of a dog?\"\n\n\"You are insulting!  But because I believe you mean well, I shall tell\nyou that it is impossible for me to go for several days at least.  As\nsoon as I honorably can, I shall come and the scandal will vanish like\nsmoke.\"\n\nOtto let him go.  \"I mustn't thrash him,  and I can't compel him to be\na man.\"  He returned to the German Theater; he must learn all he could\nabout this Feuerstein.\n\n\"Did you see him?\" asked the ticket-seller.\n\n\"Yes, but I didn't get anything.\"\n\nOtto looked so down that the ticket-seller was moved to pity, to\ngenerosity.\n\n\"Well, I'll give you a tip.  Keep after him; keep your eye on him.\nHe's got a rich father-in-law.\"\n\nOtto leaned heavily on the sill of the little window. \"Father-in-law?\"\nA sickening suspicion peered into his mind.\n\n\"He was full the other night and he told one of our people he was\nmarried to a rich man's daughter.\"\n\n\"Was the name Brauner?\" asked Otto.\n\n\"He didn't name any names.  But--let me think--they say it's a daughter\nof a brewer, away up town.  Yes, Ganser--I think that was the name.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Otto's face brightened.  \"Where is Ganser's place?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know--look in the directory.  But the tip is to wait a few\ndays.  He hasn't got hold of any of the old man's money yet--there's\nsome hitch.  There'll be plenty for all when it comes, so you needn't\nfret.\"\n\nOtto went to the brewery, but Peter had gone home.  Otto went on to the\nhouse and Peter came down to the brilliant parlor, where the battle of\nhostile shades and colors was raging with undiminished fury.  In answer\nto Peter's look of inquiry, he said:  \"I came about your son-in-law,\nMr. Feuerstein.\"\n\n\"Who are you?  Who told you?\" asked Peter, wilting into a chair.\n\n\"They told me at the theater.\"\n\nPeter gave a sort of groan.  \"It's out!\" he cried, throwing up his\nthick, short arms.  \"Everybody knows!\"\n\nShrewd Otto saw the opening.  \"I don't think so,\" he replied, \"at least\nnot yet.  He has a bad reputation--I see you know that already.  But\nit's nothing to what he will have when it comes out that he's been\ntrying to marry a young lady down town since he married your daughter.\"\n\n\"But it mustn't come out!\" exclaimed Ganser.  \"I won't have it.  This\nscandal has disgraced me enough.\"\n\n\"That's what I came to see you about,\" said Otto.  \"The young lady and\nher friends don't know about his marriage.  It isn't necessary that any\nof them should know, except her.  But she must be put on her guard.  He\nmight induce her to run away with him.\"\n\n\"Rindsvieh!\" muttered Ganser, his hair and whiskers bristling. \"Dreck!\"\n\n\"I want to ask you, as a man and a father, to see that this young lady\nis warned.  She'll be anxious enough to keep  quiet. If you do, there\nwon't be any scandal--at least not from there.\"\n\n\"I'll go down and warn her.  Where is she?  I'll speak to her father.\"\n\n\"And have him make a row?  No, there's only one way.  Send your\ndaughter to her.\"\n\n\"But you don't know my daughter. She's a born--\"  Just in time Ganser\nremembered that he was talking to a stranger and talking about his\ndaughter.  \"She wouldn't do it right,\" he finished.\n\n\"She can go in and see the young lady alone and come out without\nspeaking to anybody else.  I'll promise you there'll be no risk.\"\n\nGanser thought it over and decided to take Otto's advice.  They\ndiscussed Mr. Feuerstein for several minutes, and when Otto left,\nGanser followed him part of the way down the stoop, shaking hands with\nhim.  It was a profound pleasure to the brewer to be able to speak his\nmind on the subject of his son-in-law to an intelligent, appreciative\nperson.  He talked nothing else to his wife and Lena, but he had the\nfeeling that he might as well talk aloud to himself.\n\nAfter supper--the Gansers still had supper in the evening, their\nfashionable progress in that direction having reached only the stage at\nwhich dinner is called luncheon--he put Lena into the carriage and they\ndrove to Avenue A.  On the way he told her exactly what to say and do.\nHe stayed in the carriage.  \"Be quick,\" he said, \"and no foolishness!\"\n\nLena, swelling and rustling with finery and homelier than before her\ntroubles, little though they disturbed her, marched into the shop and\nup to the end counter, where Hilda was standing.\n\n\"You are Miss Hilda Brauner?\" she said.  \"I want to see you alone.\"\n\nHilda looked her surprise but showed Lena into the living-room, which\nhappened to be vacant.  Lena could not begin, so intent was she upon\nexamining her rival.  \"How plain she's dressed,\" she thought, \"and how\nthin and black she is!\"  But it was in vain; she could not deceive her\nrising jealousy.  It made her forget her father's instructions, forget\nthat she was supposed to hate Feuerstein and was getting rid of him.\n\n\"I am Mrs. Carl Feuerstein,\" she cried, her face red and her voice\nshrill with anger and excitement.  \"And I want you to stop flirting\nwith my husband!\"\n\nHilda stood petrified.  Lena caught sight of a photograph on the\nmantelpiece behind Hilda.  She gave a scream of fury and darted for it.\n\"How dare you!\" she shrieked.  \"You impudent THING!\" She snatched the\nframe, tore it away from the photograph and flung it upon the floor. As\nshe gazed at that hair like a halo of light, at those romantic features\nand upturned eyes, she fell to crying and kissing them.\n\nHilda slowly turned and watched the spectacle--the swollen, pudgy face,\ntear-stained, silly, ugly, the tears and kisses falling upon the\nlikeness of HER lover.  She suddenly sprang at Lena, her face like a\nthunder-storm, her black brows straight and her great eyes flashing.\n\"You lie!\" she exclaimed.  And she tore the photograph from Lena's\nhands and clasped it to her bosom.\n\nLena shrank in physical fear from this aroused lioness.  \"He's my\nhusband,\" she whined.  \"You haven't got any right to his picture.\"\n\n\"You lie!\" repeated Hilda, throwing back her head.\n\n\"It's the truth,\" said Lena, beginning to cry.  \"I swear to God it's\nso.  You can  ask pa if it ain't.  He's Mr. Ganser, the brewer.\"\n\n\"Who sent you here to lie about him to me?\"\n\n\"Oh, you needn't put on.  You knew he was married.  I don't wonder\nyou're mad.  He's MY husband, while he's only been making a fool of\nYOU.  You haven't got any shame.\"  Lena's eyes were on the photograph\nagain and her jealousy over-balanced fear.  She laughed tauntingly.\n\n\"Of course you're trying to brazen it out.  Give me that picture!  He's\nmy husband!\"\n\nJust then Ganser appeared in the doorway--he did not trust his daughter\nand had followed her when he thought she was staying too long.  At\nsight of him she began to weep again.  \"She won't believe me, pa,\" she\nsaid.  \"Look at her standing there hugging his picture.\"\n\nGanser scowled at his daughter and addressed himself to Hilda, \"It's\ntrue,  Miss,\" he said.  \"The man is a scoundrel.  I sent my daughter to\nwarn you.\"\n\nHilda looked at him haughtily.  \"I don't know you,\" she said, \"and I do\nknow him.  I don't know why you've come here to slander him.  But I do\nknow that I'd trust him against the whole world.\"  She glanced from\nfather to daughter.  \"You haven't done him any harm and you might as\nwell go.\"\n\nPeter eyed her in disgust.  \"You're as big a fool as my Lena,\" he said.\n\"Come on, Lena.\"\n\nAs Lena was leaving the room, she gave Hilda a malignant glance. \"He's\nMY husband,\" she said spitefully, \"and you're--well, I wouldn't want to\nsay what you are.\"\n\n\"Move!\" shouted Ganser, pushing her out of the room.  His parting shot\nat Hilda was:  \"Ask him.\"\n\nHilda, still holding the photograph, stared at the doorway through\nwhich they had disappeared.  \"You lie!\" she repeated, as if they were\nstill there.  Then again, a little catch in her voice:  \"You lie!\"  And\nafter a longer interval, a third time, with a sob in her throat:  \"You\nlie!  I know you lie!\"  She sat at the table and held the photograph\nbefore her.  She kissed it passionately, gazed long at it, seeing in\nthose bold handsome features all that her heart's love believed of him.\n\nSuddenly she started up, went rapidly down the side hall and out into\nthe street.  Battling with her doubts, denouncing herself as disloyal\nto him, she hurried up the Avenue and across the Square and on until\nshe came to his lodgings.  When she asked for him the maid opened the\nparlor door and called through the crack: \"Mr. Feuerstein, a lady wants\nto see you.\"\n\nAs the maid disappeared down the basement stairs, Mr. Feuerstein\nappeared.  At  sight of her he started back.  \"Hilda!\" he exclaimed\ntheatrically, and frowned.\n\n\"Don't be angry with me,\" she said humbly.  \"I wouldn't have come,\nonly--\"\n\n\"You must go at once!\"  His tone was abrupt, irritated.\n\n\"Yes--I will.  I just wanted to warn you--\"  She raised her eyes\nappealingly toward his face.  \"Two people came to see me to-night--Mr.\nGanser and his daughter--\"\n\nFeuerstein fell back a step and she saw that he was shaking and that\nhis face had become greenish white.  \"It's false!\" he blustered.\n\"False as hell!--\"\n\nAnd she knew that it was true.\n\nShe continued to look at him and he did not try to meet her eyes. \"What\ndid they tell you?\" he said, after a long pause, remembering that he\nhad denied before a charge had been made.\n\nShe was looking away from him now.  She seemed not to have heard him.\n\"I must go,\" she murmured, and began slowly to descend the stoop.\n\nHe followed her, laid his hand upon her arm.  \"Hilda!\" he pleaded.\n\"Let me explain!\"\n\n\"Don't touch me!\"  She snatched her arm away from him.  She ran down\nthe rest of the steps and fled along the street.  She kept close to the\nshadow of the houses.  She went through Avenue A with hanging head,\nfeeling that the eyes of all were upon her, condemning, scorning.  She\nhid herself in her little room, locking the door.  Down beside the bed\nshe sank and buried her face in the covers.  And there she lay, racked\nwith the pain of her gaping wounds--wounds to love, to trust, to pride,\nto self-respect.  \"Oh, God, let me die,\" she moaned.  \"I can't ever\nlook anybody in the face again.\"\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nA SHEEP WIELDS THE SHEARS\n\nA few days later Peter Ganser appeared before Beck, triumph flaunting\nfrom his stupid features.  Beck instantly scented bad news.\n\n\"Stop the case,\" said Peter with a vulgar insolence that grated upon\nthe lawyer.  \"It's no good.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Ganser.  I don't follow you.\"\n\n\"But I follow myself.  Stop the case.  I pay you off now.\"\n\n\"You can't deal with courts as you can with your employees, Mr. Ganser.\nThere are legal forms to be gone through.  Of course, if you're\nreconciled to your son-in-law, why--\"\n\nPeter laughed.  \"Son-in-law!  That  scoundrel--he's a bigamist. I got\nthe proofs from Germany this morning.\"\n\nBeck became blue round the edges of his mouth and his eyes snapped.\n\"So you've been taking steps in this case without consulting me, Mr.\nGanser?\"\n\n\"I don't trust lawyers.  Anyway, what I hire you for?  To try my case.\nIt's none of your business what I do outside.  I pay you off, and I\ndon't pay for any dirty works I don't get.\"  He had wrought himself\ninto a fury.  Experience had taught him that that was the best mood in\nwhich to conduct an argument about money.\n\n\"We'll send you your bill,\" said Beck, in a huge, calm rage against\nthis dull man who had outwitted him.  \"If you wish to make a scene,\nwill you kindly go elsewhere?\"\n\n\"I want to pay you off--right away quick.  I think you and Loeb in\ncahoots.  My detective, he says you both must have known about\nFeuerstein.  He says you two were partners and knew his record. I'll\nexpose you, if you don't settle now.  Give me my bill.\"\n\n\"It is impossible.\"  Beck's tone was mild and persuasive. \"All the\nitems are not in.\"\n\nGanser took out a roll of notes.  \"I pay you five hundred dollars.\nTake it or fight.  I want a full receipt.  I discharge you now.\"\n\n\"My dear sir, we do not give our services for any such sum as that.\"\n\n\"Yes you do.  And you don't get a cent more.  If I go out of here\nwithout my full receipt, I fight.  I expose you, you swindler.\"\n\nPeter was shouting at the top of his lusty lungs.  Beck wrote a receipt\nand handed it to him.  Peter read it and handed it back. \"I'm not as\nbig a fool as I look,\" he said.  \"That ain't a full receipt.\"\n\nBeck wrote again.  \"Anything to get you out of the office,\" he said, as\nhe tossed the five hundred dollars into a drawer.  \"And when your\nfamily gets you into trouble again--\"\n\nPeter snorted.  \"Shut up!\" he shouted, banging his fist on the desk.\n\"And don't you tell the papers.  If anything come out, I expose you.\nMy lawyer, Mr. Windisch, say he can have you put out of court.\"  And\nPeter bustled and slammed his way out.\n\nBeck telephoned Loeb, and they took lunch together.  \"Ganser has found\nout about Feuerstein's wife,\" was Beck's opening remark.\n\nLoeb drew his lip back over his teeth.\n\n\"I wish I'd known it two hours sooner.  I let Feuerstein have ten\ndollars more.\"\n\n\"More?\"\n\n\"More.  He's had ninety-five on account.  I relied on you to handle the\nbrewer.\"\n\n\"And we're out our expenses in getting ready for trial.\"\n\n\"Well--you'll send Ganser a heavy bill.\"\n\nBeck shook his head dismally.  \"That's the worst of it.  He called me a\nswindler, said he'd show that you and I were in a conspiracy, and dared\nme to send him a bill.  And in the circumstances I don't think I will.\"\n\nLoeb gave Beck a long and searching look which Beck bore without\nflinching.\n\n\"No, I don't think you will send him a bill,\" said Loeb slowly. \"But\nhow much did he pay you?\"\n\n\"Not a cent--nothing but insults.\"\n\nLoeb finished his luncheon in silence.  But he and Beck separated on\nthe friendliest terms.  Loeb was too practical a philosopher to hate\nanother man for doing that which he would have done himself if he had\nhad the chance.  At his office he told a clerk to send Feuerstein a\nnote, asking him to call the next morning. When Feuerstein came into\nthe anteroom the gimlet-eyed office boy disappeared through one of the\ndoors in the partition and reappeared after a longer absence than\nusual.  He looked at Feuerstein with a cynical, contemptuous smile in\nhis eyes.\n\n\"Mr. Loeb asks me to tell you,\" he said, \"with his compliments, that\nyou are a bigamist and a swindler, and that if you ever show your face\nhere again he'll have you locked up.\"\n\nFeuerstein staggered and paled--there was no staginess in his manner.\nThen without a word he slunk away.  He had not gone far up Center\nStreet before a hand was laid upon his shoulder from behind.  He\nstopped as if he had been shot; he shivered; he slowly, and with a look\nof fascinated horror, turned to see whose hand had arrested him.\n\nHe was looking into the laughing face of a man who was obviously a\ndetective.\n\n\"You don't seem glad to see me, old boy,\" said the detective with\ncontemptuous familiarity.\n\n\"I don't know you, sir.\"  Feuerstein made a miserable attempt at\nhaughtiness.\n\n\"Of course you don't.  But I know YOU--all about you.  Come in here and\nlet's sit down a minute.\"\n\nThey went into a saloon and the detective ordered two glasses of beer.\n\"Now listen to me, young fellow,\" he said.\n\n\"You're played out in this town.  You've got to get a move on you, see?\nWe've been looking you up, and you're wanted for bigamy.  But if you\nclear out, you won't be followed.  You've got to leave today,\nunderstand?  If you're here to-morrow morning, up the road you go.\"\nThe detective winked and waggled his thumb meaningly in a northerly\ndirection.\n\nFeuerstein was utterly crushed.  He gulped down the beer and sat wiping\nthe sweat from his face.  \"I have done nothing,\" he protested in tragic\ntones.  \"Why am I persecuted--I, poor, friendless, helpless?\"\n\n\"Pity about you,\" said the detective.\n\n\"You'd better go west and start again.  Why not try honest work? It's\nnot so bad, they say, once you get broke in.\"  He rose and shook hands\nwith Feuerstein.  \"So long,\" he said.  \"Good luck! Don't forget!\"  And\nagain he winked and waggled his thumb in the direction of the\npenitentiary.\n\nFeuerstein went to his lodgings, put on all the clothes he could wear\nwithout danger of attracting his landlady's attention, filled his\npockets and the crown of his hat with small articles, and fled to\nHoboken.\n\n\n\nIX\n\nAN IDYL OF PLAIN PEOPLE\n\nHilda had not spent her nineteen years in the glare of the Spartan\npublicity in which the masses live without establishing a character.\nJust as she knew all the good points and bad in all the people of that\ncommunity, so they knew all hers, and therefore knew what it was\npossible for her to do and what impossible.  And if a baseless lie is\nswift of foot where everybody minutely scrutinizes everybody else, it\nis also scant of breath.  Sophie's scandal soon dwindled to a whisper\nand expired, and the kindlier and probable explanation of Hilda's wan\nface and downcast eyes was generally accepted.\n\nHer code of morals and her method of dealing with moral questions were\nthose  of all the people about her--strict, severe, primitive.\nFeuerstein was a cheat, a traitor.  She cast him out of her heart--cast\nhim out at once and utterly and for ever.  She could think of him only\nwith shame.  And it seemed to her that she was herself no longer\npure--she had touched pitch; how could she be undefiled?\n\nShe accepted these conclusions and went about her work, too busy to\nindulge in hysteria of remorse, repining, self-examination.\n\nShe avoided Otto, taking care not to be left alone with him when he\ncalled on Sundays, and putting Sophie between him and her when he came\nup to them in the Square.  But Otto was awaiting his chance, and when\nit came, plunged boldly into his heart-subject and floundered bravely\nabout.  \"I don't like to see you so sad, Hilda.  Isn't there any chance\nfor me?  Can't things be as they used to be?\"\n\nHilda shook her head sadly.  \"I'm never going to marry,\" she said.\n\"You must find some one else.\"\n\n\"It's you or nobody.  I said that when we were in school together\nand--I'll stick to it.\"  His eyes confirmed his words.\n\n\"You mustn't, Otto.  You make me feel as if I were spoiling your life.\nAnd if you knew, you wouldn't want to marry me.\"\n\n\"I don't care.  I always have, and I always will.\"\n\n\"I suppose I ought to tell you,\" she said, half to herself. She turned\nto him suddenly, and, with flushed cheeks and eyes that shifted, burst\nout:  \"Otto, he was a married man!\"\n\n\"But you didn't know.\"\n\n\"It doesn't change the way I feel.  You might--any man might--throw it\nup to me.  And sooner or later, everybody'll know.  No man would want a\ngirl that had had a scandal like that on her.\"\n\n\"I would,\" he said, \"and I do.  And it isn't a scandal.\"\n\nSome one joined them and he had no chance to continue until the\nfollowing Sunday, when Heiligs and Brauners went together to the Bronx\nfor a half-holiday.  They could not set out until their shops closed,\nat half-past twelve, and they had to be back at five to reopen for the\nSunday supper customers.  They lunched under the trees in the yard of a\nGerman inn, and a merry party they were.\n\nHilda forgot to keep up her pretense that her healing wounds were not\nhealing and never would heal.  She teased Otto and even flirted with\nhim.  This elevated her father and his mother to hilarity.  They were\ntwo very sensible young-old people, with a keen sense of humor--the\nexperience of age added to the simplicity and gaiety of youth.\n\nYou would have paused to admire and envy had you passed that way and\nlooked in under the trees, as they clinked glasses and called one to\nanother and went off into gales of mirth over nothing at all.  What\nlaughter is so gay as laughter at nothing at all?  Any one must laugh\nwhen there is something to laugh at; but to laugh just because one must\nhave an outlet for bubbling spirits there's the test of happiness!\n\nAfter luncheon they wandered into the woods and soon Otto and Hilda\nfound themselves alone, seated by a little waterfall, which in a quiet,\nsentimental voice suggested that low tones were the proper tones to use\nin that place.\n\n\"We've known each other always, Hilda,\" said Otto.  \"And we know all\nabout each other.  Why not--dear?\"\n\nShe did not speak for several minutes.\n\n\"You know I haven't any heart to give you,\" she answered at last.\n\nOtto did not know anything of the kind, but he knew she thought so, and\nhe was too intelligent to dispute, when time would settle the\nquestion--and, he felt sure, would settle it right.  So he reached out\nand took her hand and said:  \"I'll risk that.\"\n\nAnd they sat watching the waterfall and listening to it, and they were\nhappy in a serious, tranquil way.  It filled him with awe to think that\nhe had at last won her.  As for her, she was looking forward, without\nillusions, without regrets, to a life of work and content beside this\nstrong, loyal, manly man who protested little, but never failed her or\nany one else.\n\nOn the way home in the train she told her mother, and her mother told\nher father.  He, then and there, to the great delight and pleasure of\nthe others in the car, rose up and embraced and kissed first his\ndaughter, then Otto and then Otto's  mother. And every once in a while\nhe beamed down the line of his party and said:  \"This is a happy day!\"\n\nAnd he made them all come into the sitting-room back of the shop. \"Wait\nhere,\" he commanded.  \"No one must move!\"\n\nHe went down to the cellar, presently to reappear with a dusty bottle\nof Johannisberger Cabinet.  He pointed proudly to the seal.  \"Bronze!\"\nhe exclaimed.  \"It is wine like gold.  It must be drunk slowly.\"  He\ndrew the cork and poured the wine with great ceremony, and they all\ndrank with much touching of glasses and bowing and exchanging of good\nwishes, now in German, now in English, again in both.  And the last\ntoast, the one drunk with the greatest enthusiasm, was Brauner's\nfavorite famous \"Arbeit und Liebe und Heim!\"\n\nFrom that time forth Hilda began to look at Otto from a different point\nof  view.  And everything depends on point of view.\n\n\nThen--the house in which Schwartz and Heilig had their shop was burned.\nAnd when their safe was drawn from the ruins, they found that their\ninsurance had expired four days before the fire.  It was Schwartz's\nbusiness to look after the insurance, but Otto had never before failed\nto oversee.  His mind had been in such confusion that he had forgotten.\n\nHe stared at the papers, stunned by the disaster.  Schwartz wrung his\nhands and burst into tears.  \"I saw that you were in trouble,\" he\nwailed, \"and that upset me.  It's my fault.  I've ruined us both.\"\n\nThere was nothing left of their business or capital, nothing but seven\nhundred dollars in debts to the importers of whom they bought.\n\nHeilig shook off his stupor after a few  minutes.  \"No matter,\" he\nsaid.  \"What's past is past.\"\n\nHe went straightway over to Second Avenue to the shop of Geishener, the\nlargest delicatessen dealer in New York.\n\n\"I've been burned out,\" he explained.  \"I must get something to do.\"\n\nGeishener offered him a place at eleven dollars a week.  \"I'll begin in\nthe morning,\" said Otto.  Then he went to Paul Brauner.\n\n\"When will you open up again?\" asked Brauner.\n\n\"Not for a long time, several years.  Everything's gone and I've taken\na place with Geishener.  I came to say that--that I can't marry your\ndaughter.\"\n\nBrauner did not know what answer to make.  He liked Otto and had\nconfidence in him.  But the masses of the people build their little\nfortunes as coral insects build their islands.  And Hilda was getting\nalong--why, she would be twenty in four months.  \"I don't know.  I\ndon't know.\" Brauner rubbed his head in embarrassment and perplexity.\n\"It's bad--very bad.  And everything was running so smoothly.\"\n\nHilda came in.  Both men looked at her guiltily.  \"What is it?\" she\nasked.  And if they had not been mere men they would have noticed a\nchange in her face, a great change, very wonderful and beautiful to see.\n\n\"I came to release you,\" said Otto.\n\n\"I've got nothing left--and a lot of debts.  I--\"\n\n\"Yes--I know,\" interrupted Hilda.  She went up to him and put her arm\nround his neck.  \"We'll have to begin at the bottom,\" she said with a\ngentle, cheerful smile.\n\nBrauner pretended that he heard some one calling him from the shop.\n\"Yes  right away!\" he shouted.  And when he was alone in the shop he\nwiped his eyes, not before a large tear had blistered the top sheet of\na pile of wrapping paper.\n\n\"I know you don't care for me as--as\"--Otto was standing uneasily, his\neyes down and his face red.  \"It was hard enough for you before.\nNow--I couldn't let you do it--dear.\"\n\n\"You can't get rid of me so easily,\" she said.  \"I know I'm getting\nalong and I won't be an old maid.\"\n\nHe paid no attention to her raillery.  \"I haven't got anything to ask\nyou to share,\" he went on.  \"I've been working ever since I was\neleven--and that's fourteen years--to get what I had. And it's all\ngone.  It'll take several years to pay off my debts, and mother must be\nsupported.  No--I've got to give it up.\"\n\n\"Won't you marry me, Otto?\" She put her arms round his neck.\n\nHis lips trembled and his voice broke.  \"I can't--let you do it, Hilda.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"  She pretended to sigh.\n\n\"But you must come back this evening.  I want to ask you again.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'll come.  But you can't change me.\"\n\nHe went, and she sat at the table, with her elbows on it and her face\nbetween her hands, until her father came in.  Then she said: \"We're\ngoing to be married next week.  And I want two thousand dollars.  We'll\ngive you our note.\"\n\nBrauner rubbed his face violently.\n\n\"We're going to start a delicatessen,\" she continued, \"in the empty\nstore where Bischoff was.  It'll take two thousand dollars to start\nright.\"\n\n\"That's a good deal of money,\" objected her father.\n\n\"You only get three and a half per cent. in the savings bank,\" replied\nHilda.  \"We'll give you six.  You know it'll be safe--Otto and I\ntogether can't fail to do well.\"\n\nBrauner reflected.  \"You can have the money,\" he said.\n\nShe went up the Avenue humming softly one of Heine's love songs, still\nwith that wonderful, beautiful look in her eyes.  She stopped at the\ntenement with the vacant store.  The owner, old man Schulte, was\nsweeping the sidewalk.  He had an income of fifteen thousand a year;\nbut he held that he needed exercise, that sweeping was good exercise,\nand that it was stupid for a man, simply because he was rich, to stop\ntaking exercise or to take it only in some form which had no useful\nside.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said Hilda.  \"What rent do you ask for this store?\"\n\n\"Sixty dollars a month,\" answered the old man, continuing his sweeping.\n\"Taxes are up, but rents are down.\"\n\n\"Not with you, I guess.  Otto Heilig and I are going to get married and\nopen a delicatessen.  But sixty dollars a month is too much.  Good\nmorning.\"  And she went on.\n\nSchulte leaned on his broom.  \"What's your hurry?\" he called. \"You\ncan't get as good a location as this.\"\n\nHilda turned, but seemed to be listening from politeness rather than\nfrom interest.\n\n\"We can't pay more than forty,\" she answered, starting on her way again.\n\n\"I might let you have it for fifty,\" Schulte called after her, \"if you\ndidn't want any fixing up.\"\n\n\"It'd have to be fixed up,\" said Hilda, halting again.  \"But I don't\ncare much for the neighborhood.  There are too many delicatessens here\nnow.\"\n\nShe went on more rapidly and the old man resumed his sweeping,\nmuttering crossly into his long, white beard.  As she  came down the\nother side of the street half an hour later, she was watching Schulte\nfrom the corner of her eye.  He was leaning on his broom, watching her.\nSeeing that she was going to pass without stopping he called to her and\nwent slowly across the street.  \"You would make good tenants,\" he said.\n\"I had to sue Bischoff.  You can have it for forty--if you'll pay for\nthe changes you want--you really won't want any.\"\n\n\"I was looking at it early this morning,\" replied Hilda. \"There'll have\nto be at least two hundred dollars spent.  But then I've my eye on\nanother place.\"\n\n\"Forty's no rent at all,\" grumbled the old man, pulling at his whiskers.\n\n\"I can get a store round in Seventh Street for thirty-five and that\nincludes three rooms at the back.  You've got only one room at the\nback.\"\n\n\"There's a kitchen, too,\" said Schulte.\n\n\"A kitchen?  Oh, you mean that closet.\"\n\n\"I'll let you have it for forty, with fifty the second year.\"\n\n\"No, forty for two years.  We can't pay more.  We're just starting, and\nexpenses must be kept down.\"\n\n\"Well, forty then.  You are nice people--hard workers.  I want to see\nyou get on.\"  The philanthropic old man returned to his sweeping.\n\"Always the way, dealing with a woman,\" he growled into his beard.\n\"They don't know the value of anything.  Well, I'll get my money\nanyway, and that's a point.\"\n\nShe spent the day shopping and by half-past five had her arrangements\nalmost completed.  And she told every one about the coming marriage and\nthe new shop and asked them to spread the news.\n\n\"We'll be open for business next Saturday a week,\" she said. \"Give us a\ntrial.\"\n\nBy nightfall Otto was receiving congratulations.  He protested, denied,\nbut people only smiled and winked.  \"You're not so sly as you think,\"\nthey said.  \"No doubt she promised to keep it quiet, but you know how\nit is with a woman.\"\n\nWhen he called at Brauner's at seven he was timid about going in.\n\"They've heard the story,\" he said to himself, \"and they must think I\nwent crazy and told it.\"\n\nShe had been bold enough all day, but she was shy, now that the time\nhad come to face him and confess--she had been a little shy with him\nunderneath ever since she had suddenly awakened to the fact that he was\na real hero--in spite of his keeping a shop just like everybody else\nand making no pretenses.  He listened without a word.\n\n\"You can't back out now,\" she ended.\n\nStill he was silent.  \"Are you angry at me?\" she asked timidly.\n\nHe could not speak.  He put his arms round her and pressed his face\ninto her waving black hair.  \"MY Hilda,\" he said in a low voice.  And\nshe felt his blood beating very fast, and she understood.\n\n\"Arbeit und Liebe und Heim,\" she quoted slowly and softly.\n\n\n\nX\n\nMR. FEUERSTEIN IS CONSISTENT\n\nThe next day Mr. Feuerstein returned from exile.  It is always\ndisillusioning to inspect the unheroic details of the life of that\nfavorite figure with romancers--the soldier of fortune.  Of Mr.\nFeuerstein's six weeks in Hoboken it is enough to say that they were\nweeks of storm and stress--wretched lodgments in low boarding-houses,\nodd jobs at giving recitations in beer halls, undignified ejectments\nfor drunkenness and failure to pay, borrowings which were removed from\nfrank street-begging only in his imagination.  He sank very low indeed,\nbut it must be recorded to the credit of his consistency that he never\neven contemplated the idea of working for a living.  And now here he\nwas, back in New York, with Hoboken an exhausted field, with no\nresources, no hopes, no future that his brandy-soaked brain could\ndiscern.\n\nHis mane was still golden and bushy; but it was ragged and too long in\nfront of the ears and also on his neck.  His face still expressed\ninsolence and vanity; but it had a certain tragic bitterness, as if it\nwere trying to portray the emotions of a lofty spirit flinging defiance\nat destiny from a slough of despair.  It was plain that he had been\ndrinking heavily--the whites of his eyes were yellow and bloodshot, the\nmuscles of his eyelids and mouth twitched disagreeably.  His romantic\nhat and collar and graceful suit could endure with good countenance\nonly the most casual glance of the eye.\n\nMr. Feuerstein had come to New York to perform a carefully-planned last\nact in his life-drama, one that would send the curtain down amid tears\nand plaudits for Mr. Feuerstein, the central figure, enwrapped in a\nsomber and baleful blaze of glory. He had arranged everything except\nsuch details as must be left to the inspiration of the moment.  He was\nimpatient for the curtain to rise--besides, he had empty pockets and\nmight be prevented from his climax by a vulgar arrest for vagrancy.\n\nAt one o'clock Hilda was in her father's shop alone.  The rest of the\nfamily were at the midday dinner.  As she bent over the counter, near\nthe door, she was filling a sheet of wrapping paper with\nfigures--calculations in connection with the new business. A shadow\nfell across her paper and she looked up.  She shrank and clasped her\nhands tightly against her bosom.  \"Mr. Feuerstein!\" she exclaimed in a\nlow, agitated voice.\n\nHe stood silent, his face ghastly as if he were very ill.  His eyes,\nsunk deep in blue-black sockets, burned into hers with an intensity\nthat terrified her.  She began slowly to retreat.\n\n\"Do not fly from me,\" he said in a hollow voice, leaning against the\ncounter weakly.  \"I have come only for a moment. Then--you will see me\nnever again!\"\n\nShe paused and watched him.  His expression, his tone, his words filled\nher with pity for him.\n\n\"You hate me,\" he went on.  \"You abhor me.  It is just--just! Yet\"--he\nlooked at her with passionate sadness--\"it was because I loved you that\nI deceived you.  Because--I--loved you!\"\n\n\"You must go away,\" said Hilda, pleading rather than commanding.\n\"You've done me enough harm.\"\n\n\"I shall harm you no more.\"  He drew himself up in gloomy majesty.  \"I\nhave finished my life.  I am bowing my farewell. Another instant, and I\nshall vanish into the everlasting night.\"\n\n\"That would be cowardly!\" exclaimed Hilda.  She was profoundly moved.\n\"You have plenty to live for.\"\n\n\"Do you forgive me, Hilda?\"  He gave her one of his looks of tragic\neloquence.\n\n\"Yes--I forgive you.\"\n\nHe misunderstood the gentleness of her voice.  \"She loves me still!\" he\nsaid to himself.  \"We shall die together and our names will echo down\nthe ages.\"  He looked burningly at her and said:  \"I was mad--mad with\nlove for you.  And when I realized that I had lost you, I went down,\ndown, down.  God!  What have I not suffered for your sake, Hilda!\"  As\nhe talked he convinced himself, pictured himself to himself as having\nbeen drawn on by a passion such as had ruined many others of the great\nof earth.\n\n\"That's all past now.\"  She spoke impatiently, irritated against\nherself because she was not hating him.  \"I don't care to hear any more\nof that kind of talk.\"\n\nA customer came in, and while Hilda was busy Mr. Feuerstein went to the\nrear counter.  On a chopping block lay a knife with a long, thin blade,\nground to a fine edge and a sharp point.  He began to play with it, and\npresently, with a sly, almost insane glance to assure himself that she\nwas not seeing, slipped it into the right outside pocket of his coat.\nThe customer left and he returned to the front of the shop and stood\nwith just the breadth of the end of the narrow counter between him and\nher.\n\n\"It's all over for me,\" he began.  \"Your love has failed me. There is\nnothing left.  I shall fling myself through the gates of death.  I\nshall be forgotten.  And you will live on and laugh and not remember\nthat you ever had such love as mine.\"\n\nAnother customer entered.  Mr. Feuerstein again went to the rear of the\nspace outside the counters.  \"She loves me.  She will gladly die with\nme,\" he muttered.  \"First into HER heart, then into mine, and we shall\nbe at peace, dead, as lovers and heroes die!\"\n\nWhen they were again alone, he advanced and began to edge round the end\nof the counter.  She was no longer looking at him, did not note his\nexcitement, was thinking only of how to induce him to go.  \"Hilda,\" he\nsaid, \"I have one last request--a dying man's request--\"\n\nThe counter was no longer between them.  He was within three feet of\nher.  His right hand was in his coat pocket, grasping the knife.  His\neyes began to blaze and he nerved himself to seize her--\n\nBoth heard her father's voice in the hall leading to the sitting-room.\n\"You must go,\" she cried, hastily retreating.\n\n\"Hilda,\" he pleaded rapidly, \"there is something I must say to you.  I\ncan not say it here.  Come over to Meinert's as soon as you can.  I\nshall be in the sitting-room.  Just for a moment, Hilda.  It might save\nmy life.  If not that, it certainly would make my death happier.\"\n\nBrauner was advancing into the shop and his lowering face warned Mr.\nFeuerstein not to linger.  With a last, appealing look at Hilda he\ndeparted.\n\n\"What was HE doing here?\" growled Brauner.\n\n\"He'd just come in,\" answered Hilda absently.  \"He won't bother us any\nmore.\"\n\n\"If he comes again, don't speak to him,\" said Brauner in the commanding\nvoice that sounded so fierce and meant so little. \"Just call me or\nAugust.\"\n\nHilda could not thrust him out of her mind.  His looks, his tones, his\ndramatic melancholy saddened her; and his last words rang in her ears.\nShe no longer loved him; but she HAD loved him.  She could not think of\nhim as a stranger and an enemy--there might be truth in his plea that\nhe had in some mysterious way fallen through love for her.  She might\nbe able to save him.\n\nAlmost mechanically she left the shop, went to Sixth Street and to the\n\"family entrance\" of Meinert's beer-garden.  She went into the little\nanteroom and, with her hand on the swinging door leading to the\nsitting-room, paused like one waking from a dream.\n\n\"I must be crazy,\" she said half aloud.  \"He's a scoundrel and no good\ncan come of my seeing him.  What would Otto think of me? What am I\ndoing here?\"  And she hastened away, hoping that no one had seen her.\n\nMr. Feuerstein was seated at a table a few feet from where she had\npaused and turned back.  He had come in half an hour before and had\nordered and drunk three glasses of cheap, fiery brandy. As the moments\npassed his mood grew wilder and more somber. \"She has failed me!\" he\nexclaimed.  He called for pen, ink and paper.  He wrote rapidly and,\nwhen he had finished, declaimed his production, punctuating the\nsentences with looks and gestures. His voice gradually broke, and he\nuttered the last words with sobs and with the tears streaming down his\ncheeks.  He signed his name with a flourish, added a postscript.  He\ntook a stamped envelope from his pocket, sealed the letter, addressed\nit and laid it before him on the table.  \"The presence of death\ninspired me,\" he said, looking at his production with tragic pride.\nAnd he called for another drink.\n\nWhen the waiter brought it, he lifted it high and, standing up, bowed\nas if some  one were opposite him at the table.  \"I drink to you,\nDeath!\" he said.  The waiter stared in open-mouthed astonishment, and\nwith a muttered, \"He's luny!\" backed from the room.\n\nHe sat again and drew the knife from his pocket and slid his finger\nalong the edge.  \"The key to my sleeping-room,\" he muttered, half\nimagining that a vast audience was watching with bated breath.\n\nThe waiter entered and he hid the knife.\n\n\"Away!\" he exclaimed, frowning heavily.  \"I wish to be alone.\"\n\n\"Mr. Meinert says you must pay,\" said the waiter.  \"Four drinks--sixty\ncents.\"\n\nMr. Feuerstein laughed sardonically.\n\n\"Pay!  Ha--ha!  Always pay!  Another drink, wretch, and I shall pay for\nall--for all!\"  He laughed, with much shaking of the shoulders and\nrolling of the eyes.\n\nWhen the waiter had disappeared he muttered:  \"I can wait no longer.\"\nHe  took the knife, held it at arm's length, blade down.  He turned his\nhead to the left and closed his eyes.  Then with a sudden tremendous\ndrive he sent the long, narrow blade deep into his neck.  The blood\nspurted out, his breath escaped from between his lips with long,\nshuddering, subsiding hisses. His body stiffened, collapsed, rolled to\nthe floor.\n\nMr. Feuerstein was dead--with empty pockets and the drinks unpaid for.\n\n\n\nXI\n\nMR. FEUERSTEIN'S CLIMAX\n\nWhen Otto came to see Hilda that evening she was guiltily effusive in\nher greeting and made up her mind that, as soon as they were alone, she\nmust tell him what she had all but done. But first there was the game\nof pinochle which Otto must lose to her father.  As they sat at their\ngame she was at the zither-table, dreamily playing May Breezes as she\nwatched Otto and thought how much more comfortable she was in his\nstrong, loyal love than in the unnatural strain of Mr. Feuerstein's\necstasies.  \"'Work and love and home,'\" she murmured, in time to her\nmusic.  \"Yes, father is right.  They ARE the best.\"\n\nAugust came in and said:  \"Hilda, here are two men who want to see you.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he was pushed aside and she, her father and Otto sat\nstaring at the two callers.  They were obviously detectives--\"plain\nclothes men\" from the Fifth-Street Station House.  There could be no\nchance of mistake about those police mustaches and jaws, those wide,\nsquare-toed, police shoes.\n\n\"My name is Casey and this is my side-partner, Mr. O'Rourke,\" said the\nshorter and fatter of the two as they seated themselves without waiting\nto be asked.  Casey took off his hat; O'Rourke's hand hesitated at the\nbrim, then drew his hat more firmly down upon his forehead.  \"Sorry to\nbreak in on your little party,\" Casey went on, \"but the Cap'n sent us\nto ask the young lady a few questions.\"\n\nHilda grew pale and her father and Otto looked frightened.\n\n\"Do you know an actor named Feuerstein?\" asked Casey.\n\nHilda trembled.  She could not speak.  She nodded assent.\n\n\"Did you see him to-day?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" almost whispered Hilda.\n\nCasey looked triumphantly at O'Rourke.  Otto half rose, then sank back\nagain.  \"Where did you see him?\" asked Casey.\n\n\"Here.\"\n\n\"Where else?\"\n\nHilda nervously laced and unlaced her fingers.  \"Only here,\" she\nanswered after a pause.\n\n\"Ah, yes you did.  Come now, lady.  Speak the truth.  You saw him at\nMeinert's.\"\n\nHilda started violently.  The detectives exchanged significant glances.\n\"No,\" she protested.  \"I saw him only here.\"\n\n\"Were you out of the store this afternoon?\"\n\nA long pause, then a faint \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Where did you go?\" Casey added.\n\nThe blood flew to Hilda's face, then left it.  \"To Meinert's,\" she\nanswered.  \"But only as far as the door.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Casey sarcastically, and O'Rourke laughed.  \"It's no use to\nhold back, lady,\" continued Casey.  \"We know all about your movements.\nYou went in Meinert's--in at the family entrance.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Hilda.  She was shaking as if she were having a chill.\n\"But just to the door, then home again.\"\n\n\"Now, that won't do,\" said Casey roughly.  \"You'd better tell the whole\nstory.\"\n\n\"Tell them all about it, Hilda,\" interposed her father in an agonized\ntone.\n\n\"Don't hold back anything.\"\n\n\"Oh--father--Otto--it was nothing.  I didn't go in.  He--Mr.\nFeuerstein--came here, and he looked so sick, and he begged me to come\nover to Meinert's for a minute.  He said he had something to say to\nme.  And then I went.  But at the door I got to thinking about all he'd\ndone, and I wouldn't go in.  I just came back home.\"\n\n\"What was it that he had done, lady?\" asked O'Rourke.\n\n\"I won't tell,\" Hilda flashed out, and she started up.  \"It's nobody's\nbusiness.  Why do you ask me all these questions? I won't answer any\nmore.\"\n\n\"Now, now, lady,\" said Casey.  \"Just keep cool.  When you went, what\ndid you take a knife from the counter for?\"\n\n\"A knife!\" Hilda gasped, and she would have fallen to the floor had not\nOtto caught her.\n\n\"That settles it!\" said Casey, in an undertone to O'Rourke. \"She's it,\nall right.  I guess she's told us enough?\"\n\nO'Rourke nodded.  \"The Cap'n'll get the rest out of her when he puts\nher through the third degree.\"\n\nThey rose and Casey said, with the roughness of one who is afraid of\nhis inward impulses to gentleness:  \"Come, lady, get on your things.\nYou're going along with us.\"\n\n\"No!  No!\" she cried in terror, flinging herself into her father's arms.\n\nBrauner blazed up.  \"What do you mean?\" he demanded, facing the\ndetectives.\n\n\"You'll find out soon enough,\" said Casey in a blustering tone. \"The\nless fuss you make, the better it'll be for you.  She's got to go, and\nthat's all there is to it.\"\n\n\"This is an outrage,\" interrupted Otto, rushing between Hilda and the\ndetectives.\n\n\"You daren't take her without telling her why.  You can't treat us like\ndogs.\"\n\n\"Drop it!\" said Casey contemptuously. \"Drop it, Dutchy.  I guess we\nknow what we're about.\"\n\n\"Yes--and I know what _I_'m about,\"  exclaimed Otto.  \"Do you know\nRiordan, the district leader here?  Well, he's a friend of mine.  If we\nhaven't got any rights you police are bound to respect, thank God,\nwe've got a 'pull'.\"\n\n\"That's a bluff,\" said Casey, but his tone was less insolent. \"Well, if\nyou must know, she's wanted for the murder of Carl Feuerstein.\"\n\nHilda flung her arms high above her head and sank into a chair and\nburied her face.  \"It's a dream!\" she moaned.  \"Wake me--wake me!\"\n\nOtto and Brauner looked each at the other in horror.  \"Murder!\"\nwhispered Brauner hoarsely.  \"My Hilda--murder!\"\n\nOtto went to Hilda and put his arms about her tightly and kissed her.\n\n\"She's got to come,\" said Casey angrily.  \"Now, will she go quietly or\nshall I call the wagon?\"\n\nThis threat threw them into a panic.  \"You'd better go,\" said Otto in\nan undertone to Hilda.  \"Don't be frightened, dear. You're innocent and\nthey can't prove you guilty.  You're not poor and friendless.\"\n\nAt the pressure of his arms Hilda lifted her face, her eyes shining at\nhim through her tears.  And her heart went out to him as never before.\nFrom that moment it was his, all his.  \"My love, my dear love,\" she\nsaid.  She went to the closet and took out her hat.  She put it on\nbefore the mirror over the mantelpiece.  \"I'm ready,\" she said quietly.\n\nIn the street, she walked beside Casey; her father and Otto were close\nbehind with O'Rourke.  They turned into Sixth Street.  Half a block\ndown, in front of Meinert's, a crowd was surging, was filling sidewalk\nand street.  When they came to the edge of it, Casey suddenly said \"In\nhere\" and took her by the arm.  All went down a long and winding\npassage, across an open court to  a back door where a policeman in\nuniform was on guard.\n\n\"Did you get her, Mike?\" said the policeman to Casey.\n\n\"Here she is,\" replied Casey.  \"She didn't give no trouble.\"\n\nThe policeman opened the door.  He let Casey, Hilda and O'Rourke pass.\nHe thrust back Brauner and Otto.  \"No, you don't,\" he said.\n\n\"Let us in!\" commanded Otto, beside himself with rage.\n\n\"Not much!  Get back!\"  He had closed the door and was standing between\nit and them, one hand meaningly upon the handle of his sheathed club.\n\n\"I am her father,\" half-pleaded, half-protested Brauner.\n\n\"Cap'n's orders,\" said the policeman in a gentler voice.  \"The best\nthing you can do is to go to the station house and wait there.  You\nwon't get to see her here.\"\n\nMeanwhile Casey, still holding Hilda by the arm, was guiding her along\na dark hall.  When they touched a door he threw it open. He pushed her\nroughly into the room.  For a few seconds the sudden blaze of light\nblinded her.  Then--\n\nBefore her, stretched upon a table, was--Mr. Feuerstein.  She shrank\nback and gazed at him with wide, fascinated eyes.  His face was turned\ntoward her, his eyes half-open; he seemed to be regarding her with a\nglassy, hateful stare--the \"curse in a dead man's eye.\"  His chin was\nfallen back and down, and his lips exposed his teeth in a hideous grin.\nAnd then she saw-- Sticking upright from his throat was a knife, the\nknife from their counter. It seemed to her to be trembling as if still\nagitated from the hand that had fiercely struck out his life.\n\n\"My God!\" moaned Hilda, sinking down to the floor and hiding her face.\n\nAs she crouched there, Casey said cheerfully to Captain Hanlon, \"You\nsee she's guilty all right, Cap'n.\"\n\nHanlon took his cigar from between his teeth and nodded.  At this a man\nsitting near him burst out laughing.  Hanlon scowled at him.\n\nThe man--Doctor Wharton, a deputy coroner--laughed again.  \"I suppose\nyou think she acts guilty,\" he said to Hanlon.\n\n\"Any fool could see that,\" retorted Hanlon.\n\n\"Any fool would see it, you'd better say,\" said Doctor Wharton. \"No\nmatter how she took it, you fellows would wag your heads and say\n'Guilty.'\"\n\nHanlon looked uneasily at Hilda, fearing she would draw encouragement\nfrom Wharton's words.  But Hilda was still moaning. \"Lift her up and\nset her in a chair,\" he said to Casey.\n\nHilda recovered herself somewhat and sat before the captain, her eyes\ndown, her fluttering hands loose in her lap.  \"What was the trouble\nbetween you and him?\"  Hanlon asked her presently in a not unkindly\ntone.\n\n\"Must I tell?\" pleaded Hilda, looking piteously at the captain. \"I\ndon't know anything about this except that he came into our store and\ntold me he was going to--to--\"\n\nShe looked at Feuerstein's dead face and shivered.  And as she looked,\nmemories flooded her, drowning resentment and fear.  She rose, went\nslowly up to him; she laid her hand softly upon his brow, pushed back\nhis long, yellow hair.  The touch of her fingers seemed to smooth the\nwild, horrible look from his features.  As she gazed down at him the\ntears welled into her eyes.  \"I won't talk against him,\" she said\nsimply.  \"He's dead--it's all over and past.\"\n\n\"She ought to go on the stage,\" growled Casey.\n\nBut Wharton said in an unsteady voice, \"That's right, Miss. They can't\nforce you to talk.  Don't say a word until you get a lawyer.\"\n\nHanlon gave him a furious look.  \"Don't you meddle in this,\" he said\nthreateningly.\n\nWharton laughed.  \"The man killed himself,\" he replied.  \"I can tell by\nthe slant of the wound.  And I don't propose to stand by and see you\ngiving your third degree to this little girl.\"\n\n\"We've got the proof, I tell you,\" said Hanlon.  \"We've got a witness\nwho saw her do it--or at least saw her here when she says she wasn't\nhere.\"\n\nWharton shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Don't say a word,\" he said to Hilda.  \"Get a lawyer.\"\n\n\"I don't want a lawyer,\" she answered.\n\n\"I'm not guilty.  Why should I get a lawyer?\"\n\n\"Well, at any rate, do all your talking in court.  These fellows will\ntwist everything you say.\"\n\n\"Take her to the station house,\" interrupted Hanlon.\n\n\"But I'm innocent,\" said Hilda, clasping her hands on her heart and\nlooking appealingly at the captain.\n\n\"Take her along, Casey.\"\n\nCasey laid hold of her arm, but she shook him off.  They went through\nthe sitting-room of the saloon and out at the side door. When Hilda saw\nthe great crowd she covered her face with her hands and shrank back.\n\"There she is!  There she is!  They're taking her to the station\nhouse!\" shouted the crowd.\n\nCasey closed the door.  \"We'll have to get the wagon,\" he said.\n\nThey sat waiting until the patrol wagon  came.  Then Hilda,\nhalf-carried by Casey, crossed the sidewalk through a double line of\nblue coats who fought back the frantically curious, pushed on by those\nbehind.  In the wagon she revived and by the time they reached the\nstation house, seemed calm.  Another great crowd was pressing in; she\nheard cries of \"There's the girl that killed him!\"  She drew herself up\nhaughtily, looked round with defiance, with indignation.\n\nHer father and Otto rushed forward as soon as she entered the doors.\nShe broke down again.  \"Take me home!  Take me home!\" she sobbed.\n\"I've not done anything.\"  The men forgot that they had promised each\nthe other to be calm, and cursed and cried alternately.  The matron\ncame, spoke to her gently.\n\n\"You'll have to go now, child,\" she said.\n\nHilda kissed her father, then she and Otto clasped each the other\nclosely.  \"It'll  turn out all right, dear,\" he said.  \"We're having a\nstreak of bad luck.  But our good luck'll be all the better when it\ncomes.\"\n\nStrength and hope seemed to pass from him into her.  She walked away\nfirmly and the last glimpse they had of her sad sweet young face was a\nglimpse of a brave little smile trying to break through its gray gloom.\nBut alone in her cell, seated upon the board that was her bed, her\ndisgrace and loneliness and danger took possession of her.  She was a\nchild of the people, brought up to courage and self-reliance.  She\ncould be brave and calm before false accusers, before staring crowds.\nBut here, with a dim gas-jet revealing the horror of grated bars and\niron ceiling, walls and floor--\n\nShe sat there, hour after hour, sleepless, tearless, her brain burning,\nthe cries of drunken prisoners in adjoining cells sounding in her ears\nlike the shrieks of  the damned.  Seconds seemed moments, moments\nhours.  \"I'm dreaming,\" she said aloud at last.  She started up and\nhurled herself against the bars, beating them with her hands.  \"I must\nwake or I'll die.  Oh, the disgrace!  Oh! the shame!\"\n\nAnd she flung herself into a corner of the bench, to dread the time\nwhen the darkness and the loneliness would cease to hide her.\n\n\n\nXII\n\nEXIT MR. FEUERSTEIN\n\nThe matron brought her up into the front room of the station house at\neight in the morning.  Casey looked at her haggard face with an\nexpression of satisfaction.  \"Her nerve's going,\" he said to the\nsergeant.  \"I guess she'll break down and confess to-day.\"\n\nThey drove her to court in a Black Maria, packed among thieves,\ndrunkards and disorderly characters.  Upon her right side pressed a\nslant-faced youth with a huge nose and wafer-thin, flapping ears, who\nhad snatched a purse in Houston Street.  On her left, lolling against\nher, was an old woman in dirty calico, with a faded black bonnet\nludicrously awry upon scant white hair--a drunkard released from the\nIsland three days before and certain to be back there by noon.\n\n\"So you killed him,\" the old woman said to her with a leer of sympathy\nand admiration.\n\nAt this the other prisoners regarded her with curiosity and deference.\nHilda made no answer, seemed not to have heard.  Her eyes were closed\nand her face was rigid and gray as stone.\n\n\"She needn't be afraid at all,\" declared a young woman in black satin,\naddressing the company at large.  \"No jury'd ever convict as\ngood-looking a girl as her.\"\n\n\"Good business!\" continued the old woman.  \"I'd 'a' killed mine if I\ncould 'a' got at him--forty years ago.\"  She nodded vigorously and\ncackled.  Her cackle rose into a laugh, the laugh into a maudlin howl,\nthe howl changing into a kind of song--\n\n     \"My love, my love, my love and I--we had\n                 to part, to part!\n       And it broke, it broke, it broke my heart\n                --it broke my heart!\"\n\n\n\"Cork up in there!\" shouted the policeman from the seat beside the\ndriver.\n\nThe old woman became abruptly silent.  Hilda moaned and quivered. Her\nlips moved.  She was murmuring, \"I can't stand it much longer--I can't.\nI'll wake soon and see Aunt Greta's picture looking down at me from the\nwall and hear mother in the kitchen--\"\n\n\"Step lively now!\"  They were at the Essex Market police court; they\nwere filing into the waiting-pen.  A lawyer, engaged by her father,\ncame there, and Hilda was sent with him into a little consultation\nroom.  He argued with her in vain.  \"I'll speak for myself,\" she said.\n\"If I had a lawyer they'd think I was guilty.\"\n\nAfter an hour the petty offenders had  been heard and judged.  A court\nofficer came to the door and called:  \"Hilda Brauner!\"\n\nHilda rose.  She seemed unconcerned, so calm was she.  Her nerves had\nreached the point at which nerves refuse to writhe, or even to record\nsensations of pain.  As she came into the dingy, stuffy little\ncourtroom she didn't note the throng which filled it to the last\ncrowded inch of standing-room; did not note the scores of sympathetic\nfaces of her anxious, loyal friends and neighbors; did not even see her\nfather and Otto standing inside the railing, faith and courage in their\neyes as they saw her advancing.\n\nThe magistrate studied her over the tops of his glasses, and his look\nbecame more and more gentle and kindly.  \"Come up here on the platform\nin front of me,\" he said.\n\nHilda took her stand with only the high desk between him and her. The\nmagistrate's tone and his kind, honest, old face reassured her.  And\njust then she felt a pressure at her elbow and heard in Otto's voice:\n\"We're all here.  Don't be afraid.\"\n\n\"Have you counsel--a lawyer?\" asked the magistrate.\n\n\"No,\" replied Hilda.  \"I haven't done anything wrong.  I don't need a\nlawyer.\"\n\nThe magistrate's eyes twinkled, but he sobered instantly to say, \"I\nwarn you that the case against you looks grave.  You had better have\nlegal help.\"\n\nHilda looked at him bravely.  \"I've only the truth to tell,\" she\ninsisted.  \"I don't want a lawyer.\"\n\n\"We'll see,\" said the magistrate, giving her an encouraging smile.  \"If\nit is as you say, you certainly won't need counsel. Your rights are\nsecure here.\"  He looked at Captain Hanlon, who was also on the\nplatform.  \"Captain,\" said he, \"your first witness--the man who found\nthe body.\"\n\n\"Meinert,\" said the captain in a low tone to a court officer, who\ncalled loudly, \"Meinert!  Meinert!\"\n\nA man stood up in the crowd.  \"You don't want me!\" he shouted, as if he\nwere trying to make himself heard through a great distance instead of a\nfew feet.\n\n\"You want--\"\n\n\"Come forward!\" commanded the magistrate sharply, and when Meinert\nstood before him and beside Hilda and had been sworn, he said, \"Now,\ntell your story.\"\n\n\"The man--Feuerstein,\" began Meinert, \"came into my place about\nhalf-past one yesterday.  He looked a little wild--as if he'd been\ndrinking or was in trouble.  He went back into the sitting-room and I\nsent in to him and--\"\n\n\"Did you go in?\"\n\n\"No, your Honor.\"\n\n\"When did you see him again?\"\n\n\"Not till the police came.\"\n\n\"Stand down.  I want evidence, not gossip.  Captain Hanlon, who found\nthe body?  Do you know?\"\n\n\"Your Honor, I understood that Mr. Meinert found it.\"\n\nThe magistrate frowned at him.  Then he said, raising his voice, \"Does\nANY ONE know who found the body?\"\n\n\"My man Wielert did,\" spoke up Meinert.\n\nA bleached German boy with a cowlick in the center of his head just\nabove his forehead came up beside Hilda and was sworn.\n\n\"You found the body?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Wielert.  He was blinking stupidly and his throat was\nexpanding and contracting with fright.\n\n\"Tell us all you saw and heard and did.\"\n\n\"I take him the brandy in.  And he sit and talk to himself.  And he ask\nfor paper and ink.  And then he write and look round like crazy.  And\nhe make luny talk I don't understand.  And he speak what he write--\"\n\nCaptain Hanlon was red and was looking at Wielert in blank amazement.\n\n\"What did he write?\" asked the magistrate.\n\n\"A letter,\" answered Wielert.  \"He put it in a envelope with a stamp on\nit and he write on the back and make it all ready.  And then I watch\nhim, and he take out a knife and feel it and speak with it.  And I go\nin and ask him for money.\"\n\n\"Your Honor, this witness told us nothing of that before,\" interrupted\nHanlon.  \"I understood that the knife--\"\n\n\"Did you question him?\" asked the magistrate.\n\n\"No,\" replied the captain humbly.  And Casey and O'Rourke shook their\nbig, hard-looking heads to indicate that they had not questioned him.\n\n\"I am curious to know what you HAVE done in this case,\" said the\nmagistrate sternly.  \"It is a serious matter to take a young girl like\nthis into custody.  You police seem unable to learn that you are not\nthe rulers, but the servants of the people.\"\n\n\"Your Honor--\" began Hanlon.\n\n\"Silence!\" interrupted the magistrate, rapping on the desk with his\ngavel.  \"Proceed, Wielert.  What kind of knife was it?\"\n\n\"The knife in his throat afterward,\" answered Wielert.  \"And I hear a\nsound like steam out a pipe--and I go in and see a lady at the street\ndoor.  She peep through the crack and her face all yellow and her eye\nbig.  And she go away.\"\n\nHilda was looking at him calmly.  She was the only person in the room\nwho was  not intensely agitated.  All eyes were upon her. There was\nabsolute silence.\n\n\"Is that lady here?\" asked the magistrate.  His voice seemed loud and\nstrained.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Wielert.  \"I see her.\"\n\nOtto instinctively put his arm about Hilda.  Her father was like a leaf\nin the wind.\n\nWielert looked at Hilda earnestly, then let his glance wander over the\nstill courtroom.  He was most deliberate.  At last he said, \"I see her\nagain.\"\n\n\"Point her out,\" said the magistrate--it was evidently with an effort\nthat he broke that straining silence.\n\n\"That lady there.\"  Wielert pointed at a woman sitting just outside the\ninclosure, with her face half-hid by her hand.\n\nA sigh of relief swelled from the crowd.  Paul Brauner sobbed.\n\n\"Why, she's our witness!\" exclaimed Hanlon, forgetting himself.\n\nThe magistrate rapped sharply, and, looking toward the woman, said,\n\"Stand up, Madam.  Officer, assist her!\"\n\nThe court officer lifted her to her feet.  Her hand dropped and\nrevealed the drawn, twitching face of Sophie Liebers.\n\n\"Your Honor,\" said Hanlon hurriedly, \"that is the woman upon whose\nstatement we made our case.  She told us she saw Hilda Brauner coming\nfrom the family entrance just before the alarm was given.\"\n\n\"Are you sure she's the woman you saw?\" said the magistrate to Wielert.\n\"Be careful what you say.\"\n\n\"That's her,\" answered Wielert.  \"I see her often.  She live across the\nstreet from Meinert's.\"\n\n\"Officer, bring the woman forward,\" commanded the magistrate.\n\nSophie, blue with terror, was almost dragged to the platform beside\nHilda.  Hilda looked stunned, dazed.\n\n\"Speak out!\" ordered the magistrate.\n\n\"You have heard what this witness testified.\"\n\nSophie was weeping violently.  \"It's all a mistake,\" she cried in a\nlow, choked voice.  \"I was scared.  I didn't mean to tell the police\nHilda was there.  I was afraid they'd think I did it if I didn't say\nsomething.\"\n\n\"Tell us what you saw.\"  The magistrate's voice was severe. \"We want\nthe whole truth.\"\n\n\"I was at our window.  And I saw Hilda come along and go in at the\nfamily entrance over at Meinert's.  And I'd seen Mr. Feuerstein go in\nthe front door about an hour before.  Hilda came out and went away.\nShe looked so queer that I wanted to see.  I ran across the street and\nlooked in.  Mr. Feuerstein was sitting there with a knife in his hand.\nAnd all at once he stood up and stabbed himself in  the neck--and there\nwas blood--and he fell--and--I ran away.\"\n\n\"And did the police come to you and threaten you?\" asked the magistrate.\n\n\"Your Honor,\" protested Captain Hanlon with an injured air, \"SHE came\nto US.\"\n\n\"Is that true?\" asked the magistrate of Sophie.\n\nSophie wept loudly.  \"Your Honor,\" Hanlon went on, \"she came to me and\nsaid it was her duty to tell me, though it involved her friend.  She\nsaid positively that this girl went in, stayed several minutes, then\ncame out looking very strange, and that immediately afterward there was\nthe excitement.  Of course, we believed her.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" echoed the magistrate ironically.  \"It gave you an\nopportunity for an act of oppression.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to get Hilda into trouble.  I swear I didn't,\" Sophie\nexclaimed.  \"I was scared.  I didn't know what I was doing.  I swear I\ndidn't!\"\n\nHilda's look was pity, not anger.  \"Oh, Sophie,\" she said brokenly.\n\n\"What did your men do with the letter Feuerstein wrote?\" asked the\nmagistrate of Hanlon suspiciously.\n\n\"Your Honor, we--\" Hanlon looked round nervously.\n\nWielert, who had been gradually rising in his own estimation, as he\nrealized the importance of his part in the proceedings, now pushed\nforward, his face flushed with triumph.  \"I know where it is,\" he said\neagerly.  \"When I ran for the police I mail it.\"\n\nThere was a tumult of hysterical laughter, everybody seeking relief\nfrom the strain of what had gone before.  The magistrate rapped down\nthe noise and called for Doctor Wharton.  While he was  giving his\ntechnical explanation a note was handed up to the bench.  The\nmagistrate read:\n\n          GERMAN THEATER, 3 September.\n\nYOUR HONOR--I hasten to send you the inclosed letter which I found in\nmy mail this morning.  It seems to have an important bearing on the\nhearing in the Feuerstein case, which I see by the papers comes up\nbefore you to-day.\n\n               Very truly yours,\n               WILLIAM KONIGSMARCK,\n                                Manager.\n\n\nThe magistrate handed the inclosure to a clerk, who was a German. \"Read\nit aloud,\" he said.  And the clerk, after a few moments' preparation,\nslowly read in English:\n\nTo the Public:\n\nBefore oblivion swallows me--one second, I beg!\n\nI have sinned, but I have expiated.  I have lived bravely, fighting\nadversity and the malice which my superior gifts from nature provoked.\nI can live no longer with dignity.  So, proud and fearless to the last,\nI accept defeat and pass out.\n\nI forgive my friends.  I forget my enemies.\n\nExit Carl Feuerstein, soldier of fortune, man of the world.  A\nsensitive heart that was crushed by the cruelty of men and the kindness\nof women has ceased to beat.\n\n                           CARL FEUERSTEIN.\n\nP. S. DEAR.  MR. KONIGSMARCK--Please send a copy of the above to the\nnewspapers, English as well as German.\n                                       C. F.\n\n\nThe magistrate beamed his kindliest upon Hilda.  \"The charge against\nyou is absurd.  Your arrest was a crime.  You are free.\"\n\nHilda put her hand on Otto's arm.  \"Let us go,\" she murmured wearily.\n\nAs they went up the aisle hand in hand the crowd stood and cheered\nagain and again; the magistrate did not touch his gavel--he was nodding\nvigorous approval.  Hilda held Otto's hand more closely and looked all\nround.  And her face was bright indeed.\n\nThus the shadow of Mr. Feuerstein--of vanity and false emotion, of pose\nand pretense, passed from her life.  Straight and serene before her lay\nthe pathway of \"work and love and home.\""
