But as he finds an account\nof the circumstances given in the Notes to Law's Memorials, by his\ningenious friend, Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, Esq., and also indicated\nin his reprint of the Rev. Mr. Symson's poems appended to the Large\nDescription of Galloway, as the original of the Bride of Lammermoor, the\nAuthor feels himself now at liberty to tell the tale as he had it from\nconnexions of his own, who lived very near the period, and were closely\nrelated to the family of the bride.\n\nIt is well known that the family of Dalrymple, which has produced,\nwithin the space of two centuries, as many men of talent, civil and\nmilitary, and of literary, political, and professional eminence, as any\nhouse in Scotland, first rose into distinction in the person of James\nDalrymple, one of the most eminent lawyers that ever lived, though the\nlabours of his powerful mind were unhappily exercised on a subject so\nlimited as Scottish jurisprudence, on which he has composed an admirable\nwork.\n\nHe married Margaret, daughter to Ross of Balneel, with whom he obtained\na considerable estate. She was an able, politic, and high-minded woman,\nso successful in what she undertook, that the vulgar, no way partial to\nher husband or her family, imputed her success to necromancy. According\nto the popular belief, this Dame Margaret purchased the temporal\nprosperity of her family from the Master whom she served under a\nsingular condition, which is thus narrated by the historian of her\ngrandson, the great Earl of Stair: “She lived to a great age, and at\nher death desired that she might not be put under ground, but that her\ncoffin should stand upright on one end of it, promising that while she\nremained in that situation the Dalrymples should continue to flourish.\nWhat was the old lady's motive for the request, or whether she really\nmade such a promise, I shall not take upon me to determine; but\nit's certain her coffin stands upright in the isle of the church of\nKirklistown, the burial-place belonging to the family.” The talents\nof this accomplished race were sufficient to have accounted for\nthe dignities which many members of the family attained, without any\nsupernatural assistance. But their extraordinary prosperity was attended\nby some equally singular family misfortunes, of which that which befell\ntheir eldest daughter was at once unaccountable and melancholy.\n\nMiss Janet Dalrymple, daughter of the first Lord Stair and Dame Margaret\nRoss, had engaged herself without the knowledge of her parents to the\nLord Rutherford, who was not acceptable to them either on account of his\npolitical principles or his want of fortune. The young couple broke\na piece of gold together, and pledged their troth in the most solemn\nmanner; and it is said the young lady imprecated dreadful evils on\nherself should she break her plighted faith. Shortly after, a suitor\nwho was favoured by Lord Stair, and still more so by his lady, paid his\naddresses to Miss Dalrymple. The young lady refused the proposal, and\nbeing pressed on the subject, confessed her secret engagement. Lady\nStair, a woman accustomed to universal submission, for even her husband\ndid not dare to contradict her, treated this objection as a trifle, and\ninsisted upon her daughter yielding her consent to marry the new suitor,\nDavid Dunbar, son and heir to David Dunbar of Baldoon, in Wigtonshire.\nThe first lover, a man of very high spirit, then interfered by letter,\nand insisted on the right he had acquired by his troth plighted with the\nyoung lady. Lady Stair sent him for answer, that her daughter, sensible\nof her undutiful behaviour in entering into a contract unsanctioned by\nher parents, had retracted her unlawful vow, and now refused to fulfil\nher engagement with him.\n\nThe lover, in return, declined positively to receive such an answer from\nany one but his mistress in person; and as she had to deal with a man\nwho was both of a most determined character and of too high condition\nto be trifled with, Lady Stair was obliged to consent to an interview\nbetween Lord Rutherford and her daughter. But she took care to be\npresent in person, and argued the point with the disappointed and\nincensed lover with pertinacity equal to his own. She particularly\ninsisted on the Levitical law, which declares that a woman shall be\nfree of a vow which her parents dissent from. This is the passage of\nScripture she founded on:\n\n“If a man vow a vow unto the Lord, or swear an oath to bind his soul\nwith a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all\nthat proceedeth out of his mouth.\n\n“If a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord, and bind herself by a bond,\nbeing in her father's house in her youth; And her father hear her vow,\nand her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall\nhold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond\nwherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.\n\n“But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any\nof her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall\nstand: and the Lord shall forgive her, because her father disallowed\nher.”--Numbers xxx. 2-5.\n\nWhile the mother insisted on these topics, the lover in vain conjured\nthe daughter to declare her own opinion and feelings. She remained\ntotally overwhelmed, as it seemed--mute, pale, and motionless as a\nstatue. Only at her mother's command, sternly uttered, she summoned\nstrength enough to restore to her plighted suitor the piece of broken\ngold which was the emblem of her troth. On this he burst forth into a\ntremendous passion, took leave of the mother with maledictions, and as\nhe left the apartment, turned back to say to his weak, if not fickle,\nmistresss: “For you, madam, you will be a world's wonder”; a phrase by\nwhich some remarkable degree of calamity is usually implied. He went\nabroad, and returned not again. If the last Lord Rutherford was the\nunfortunate party, he must have been the third who bore that title, and\nwho died in 1685.\n\nThe marriage betwixt Janet Dalrymple and David Dunbar of Baldoon now\nwent forward, the bride showing no repugnance, but being absolutely\npassive in everything her mother commanded or advised. On the day of the\nmarriage, which, as was then usual, was celebrated by a great assemblage\nof friends and relations, she was the same--sad, silent, and resigned,\nas it seemed, to her destiny. A lady, very nearly connected with the\nfamily, told the Author that she had conversed on the subject with one\nof the brothers of the bride, a mere lad at the time, who had ridden\nbefore his sister to church. He said her hand, which lay on his as she\nheld her arm around his waist, was as cold and damp as marble. But,\nfull of his new dress and the part he acted in the procession, the\ncircumstance, which he long afterwards remembered with bitter sorrow and\ncompunction, made no impression on him at the time.\n\nThe bridal feast was followed by dancing. The bride and bridegroom\nretired as usual, when of a sudden the most wild and piercing cries were\nheard from the nuptial chamber. It was then the custom, to prevent any\ncoarse pleasantry which old times perhaps admitted, that the key of\nthe nuptial chamber should be entrusted to the bridesman. He was called\nupon, but refused at first to give it up, till the shrieks became so\nhideous that he was compelled to hasten with others to learn the\ncause. On opening the door, they found the bridegroom lying across the\nthreshold, dreadfully wounded, and streaming with blood. The bride\nwas then sought for. She was found in the corner of the large chimney,\nhaving no covering save her shift, and that dabbled in gore. There she\nsat grinning at them, mopping and mowing, as I heard the expression\nused; in a word, absolutely insane. The only words she spoke were, “Tak\nup your bonny bridegroom.” She survived this horrible scene little more\nthan a fortnight, having been married on the 24th of August, and dying\non the 12th of September 1669.\n\nThe unfortunate Baldoon recovered from his wounds, but sternly\nprohibited all inquiries respecting the manner in which he had received\nthem. “If a lady,” he said, “asked him any question upon the subject,\nhe would neither answer her nor speak to her again while he lived; if\na gentleman, he would consider it as a mortal affront, and demand\nsatisfaction as having received such.” He did not very long survive the\ndreadful catastrophe, having met with a fatal injury by a fall from his\nhorse, as he rode between Leith and Holyrood House, of which he died the\nnext day, 28th March 1682. Thus a few years removed all the principal\nactors in this frightful tragedy.\n\nVarious reports went abroad on this mysterious affair, many of them very\ninaccurate, though they could hardly be said to be exaggerated. It\nwas difficult at that time to become acquainted with the history of a\nScottish family above the lower rank; and strange things sometimes took\nplace there, into which even the law did not scrupulously inquire.\n\nThe credulous Mr. Law says, generally, that the Lord President Stair had\na daughter, who, “being married, the night she was bride in, was taken\nfrom her bridegroom and harled through the house (by spirits, we are\ngiven to understand) and afterward died. Another daughter,” he says,\n“was supposed to be possessed with an evil spirit.”\n\nMy friend, Mr. Sharpe, gives another edition of the tale. According\nto his information, ti was the bridegroom who wounded the bride. The\nmarriage, according to this account, had been against her mother's\ninclination, who had given her consent in these ominous words: “Weel,\nyou may marry him, but sair shall you repent it.”\n\nI find still another account darkly insinuated in some highly scurrilous\nand abusive verses, of which I have an original copy. They are docketed\nas being written “Upon the late Viscount Stair and his family, by Sir\nWilliam Hamilton of Whitelaw. The marginals by William Dunlop, writer in\nEdinburgh, a son of the Laird of Househill, and nephew to the said Sir\nWilliam Hamilton.” There was a bitter and personal quarrel and rivalry\nbetwixt the author of this libel, a name which it richly deserves, and\nLord President Stair; and the lampoon, which is written with much more\nmalice than art, bears the following motto:\n\nStair's neck, mind, wife, songs, grandson, and the rest, Are wry, false,\nwitch, pests, parricide, possessed.\n\nThis malignant satirist, who calls up all the misfortunes of the family,\ndoes not forget the fatal bridal of Baldoon. He seems, though his verses\nare as obscure as unpoetical, to intimate that the violence done to the\nbridegroom was by the intervention of the foul fiend, to whom the young\nlady had resigned herself, in case she should break her contract with\nher first lover. His hypothesis is inconsistent with the account given\nin the note upon Law's Memorials, but easily reconcilable to the family\ntradition.\n\n     In all Stair's offspring we no difference know,\n     They do the females as the males bestow;\n     So he of one of his daughters' marriages gave the ward,\n     Like a true vassal, to Glenluce's Laird;\n     He knew what she did to her master plight,\n     If she her faith to Rutherfurd should slight,\n     Which, like his own, for greed he broke outright.\n     Nick did Baldoon's posterior right deride,\n     And, as first substitute, did seize the bride;\n     Whate'er he to his mistress did or said,\n     He threw the bridegroom from the nuptial bed,\n     Into the chimney did so his rival maul,\n     His bruised bones ne'er were cured but by the fall.\n\nOne of the marginal notes ascribed to William Dunlop applies to the\nabove lines. “She had betrothed herself to Lord Rutherfoord under horrid\nimprecations, and afterwards married Baldoon, his nevoy, and her mother\nwas the cause of her breach of faith.”\n\nThe same tragedy is alluded to in the following couplet and note:\n\nWhat train of curses that base brood pursues, When the young nephew weds\nold uncle's spouse.\n\nThe note on the word “uncle” explains it as meaning “Rutherfoord, who\nshould have married the Lady Baldoon, was Baldoon's uncle.” The poetry\nof this satire on Lord Stair and his family was, as already noticed,\nwritten by Sir William Hamilton of Whitelaw, a rival of Lord Stair\nfor the situation of President of the Court of Session; a person much\ninferior to that great lawyer in talents, and equally ill-treated by the\ncalumny or just satire of his contemporaries as an unjust and partial\njudge. Some of the notes are by that curious and laborious antiquary,\nRobert Milne, who, as a virulent Jacobite, willingly lent a hand to\nblacken the family of Stair.\n\nAnother poet of the period, with a very different purpose, has left\nan elegy, in which he darkly hints at and bemoans the fate of the\nill-starred young person, whose very uncommon calamity Whitelaw, Dunlop,\nand Milne thought a fitting subject for buffoonery and ribaldry. This\nbard of milder mood was Andrew Symson, before the Revolution minister\nof Kirkinner, in Galloway, and after his expulsion as an Episcopalian\nfollowing the humble occupation of a printer in Edinburgh. He furnished\nthe family of Baldoon, with which he appears to have been intimate, with\nan elegy on the tragic event in their family. In this piece he treats\nthe mournful occasion of the bride's death with mysterious solemnity.\n\nThe verses bear this title, “On the unexpected death of the virtuous\nLady Mrs. Janet Dalrymple, Lady Baldoon, younger,” and afford us the\nprecise dates of the catastrophe, which could not otherwise have been\neasily ascertained. “Nupta August 12. Domum Ducta August 24. Obiit\nSeptember 12. Sepult. September 30, 1669.” The form of the elegy is\na dialogue betwixt a passenger and a domestic servant. The first,\nrecollecting that he had passed that way lately, and seen all around\nenlivened by the appearances of mirth and festivity, is desirous to know\nwhat had changed so gay a scene into mourning. We preserve the reply of\nthe servant as a specimen of Mr. Symson's verses, which are not of the\nfirst quality:\n\n     Sir, 'tis truth you've told.\n     We did enjoy great mirth; but now, ah me!\n     Our joyful song's turn'd to an elegie.\n     A virtuous lady, not long since a bride,\n     Was to a hopeful plant by marriage tied,\n     And brought home hither. We did all rejoice,\n     Even for her sake. But presently our voice\n     Was turn'd to mourning for that little time\n     That she'd enjoy: she waned in her prime,\n     For Atropus, with her impartial knife,\n     Soon cut her thread, and therewithal her life;\n     And for the time we may it well remember,\n     It being in unfortunate September;                   .\n     Where we must leave her till the resurrection.\n     'Tis then the Saints enjoy their full perfection.\n\nMr. Symson also poured forth his elegiac strains upon the fate of\nthe widowed bridegroom, on which subject, after a long and querulous\neffusion, the poet arrives at the sound conclusion, that if Baldoon had\nwalked on foot, which it seems was his general custom, he would have\nescaped perishing by a fall from horseback. As the work in which it\noccurs is so scarce as almost to be unique, and as it gives us the most\nfull account of one of the actors in this tragic tale which we have\nrehearsed, we will, at the risk of being tedious, insert some short\nspecimens of Mr. Symson's composition. It is entitled:\n\n“A Funeral Elegie, occasioned by the sad and much lamented death of that\nworthily respected, and very much accomplished gentleman, David Dunbar,\nyounger, of Baldoon, only son and apparent heir to the right worshipful\nSir David Dunbar of Baldoon, Knight Baronet. He departed this life on\nMarch 28, 1682, having received a bruise by a fall, as he was riding\nthe day preceding betwixt Leith and Holyrood House; and was honourably\ninterred in the Abbey Church of Holyrood House, on April 4, 1682.”\n\n     Men might, and very justly too, conclude\n     Me guilty of the worst ingratitude,\n     Should I be silent, or should I forbear\n     At this sad accident to shed a tear;\n     A tear! said I? ah! that's a petit thing,\n     A very lean, slight, slender offering,\n     Too mean, I'm sure, for me, wherewith t'attend\n     The unexpected funeral of my friend:\n     A glass of briny tears charged up to th' brim.\n     Would be too few for me to shed for him.\n\nThe poet proceeds to state his intimacy with the deceased, and the\nconstancy of the young man's attendance on public worship, which\nwas regular, and had such effect upon two or three other that were\ninfluenced by his example:\n\n     So that my Muse 'gainst Priscian avers,\n     He, only he, WERE my parishioners;\n     Yea, and my only hearers.\n\nHe then describes the deceased in person and manners, from which it\nappears that more accomplishments were expected in the composition of a\nfine gentleman in ancient than modern times:\n\n     His body, though not very large or tall,\n     Was sprightly, active, yea and strong withal.\n     His constitution was, if right I've guess'd,\n     Blood mixt with choler, said to be the best.\n     In's gesture, converse, speech, discourse, attire,\n     He practis'd that which wise men still admire,\n     Commend, and recommend. What's that? you'll say.\n     'Tis this: he ever choos'd the middle way\n     'Twixt both th' extremes. Amost in ev'ry thing\n     He did the like, 'tis worth our noticing:\n     Sparing, yet not a niggard; liberal,\n     And yet not lavish or a prodigal,\n     As knowing when to spend and when to spare;\n     And that's a lesson which not many are\n     Acquainted with. He bashful was, yet daring\n     When he saw cause, and yet therein not sparing;\n     Familiar, yet not common, for he knew\n     To condescend, and keep his distance too.\n     He us'd, and that most commonly, to go\n     On foot; I wish that he had still done so.\n     Th' affairs of court were unto him well known;\n     And yet meanwhile he slighted not his own.\n     He knew full well how to behave at court,\n     And yet but seldom did thereto resort;\n     But lov'd the country life, choos'd to inure\n     Himself to past'rage and agriculture;\n     Proving, improving, ditching, trenching, draining,\n     Viewing, reviewing, and by those means gaining;\n     Planting, transplanting, levelling, erecting\n     Walls, chambers, houses, terraces; projecting\n     Now this, now that device, this draught, that measure,\n     That might advance his profit with his pleasure.\n     Quick in his bargains, honest in commerce,\n     Just in his dealings, being much adverse\n     From quirks of law, still ready to refer\n     His cause t' an honest country arbiter.\n     He was acquainted with cosmography,\n     Arithmetic, and modern history;\n     With architecture and such arts as these,\n     Which I may call specifick sciences\n     Fit for a gentleman; and surely he\n     That knows them not, at least in some degree,\n     May brook the title, but he wants the thing,\n     Is but a shadow scarce worth noticing.\n     He learned the French, be't spoken to his praise,\n     In very little more than fourty days.\n\nThen comes the full burst of woe, in which, instead of saying much\nhimself, the poet informs us what the ancients would have said on such\nan occasion:\n\n     A heathen poet, at the news, no doubt,\n     Would have exclaimed, and furiously cry'd out\n     Against the fates, the destinies and starrs,\n     What! this the effect of planetarie warrs!\n     We might have seen him rage and rave, yea worse,\n     'Tis very like we might have heard him curse\n     The year, the month, the day, the hour, the place,\n     The company, the wager, and the race;\n     Decry all recreations, with the names\n     Of Isthmian, Pythian, and Olympick games;\n     Exclaim against them all both old and new,\n     Both the Nemaean and the Lethaean too:\n     Adjudge all persons, under highest pain,\n     Always to walk on foot, and then again\n     Order all horses to be hough'd, that we\n     Might never more the like adventure see.\n\nSupposing our readers have had enough of Mr. Symson's woe, and finding\nnothing more in his poem worthy of transcription, we return to the\ntragic story.\n\nIt is needless to point out to the intelligent reader that the\nwitchcraft of the mother consisted only in the ascendency of a powerful\nmind over a weak and melancholy one, and that the harshness with which\nshe exercised her superiority in a case of delicacy had driven her\ndaughter first to despair, then to frenzy. Accordingly, the Author\nhas endeavoured to explain the tragic tale on this principle. Whatever\nresemblance Lady Ashton may be supposed to possess to the celebrated\nDame Margaret Ross, the reader must not suppose that there was any idea\nof tracing the portrait of the first Lord Viscount Stair in the tricky\nand mean-spirited Sir William Ashton. Lord Stair, whatever might be his\nmoral qualities, was certainly one of the first statesmen and lawyers of\nhis age.\n\nThe imaginary castle of Wolf's Crag has been identified by some lover of\nlocality with that of Fast Castle. The Author is not competent to judge\nof the resemblance betwixt the real and imaginary scenes, having never\nseen Fast Castle except from the sea. But fortalices of this description\nare found occupying, like ospreys' nests, projecting rocks, or\npromontories, in many parts of the eastern coast of Scotland, and the\nposition of Fast Castle seems certainly to resemble that of Wolf's\nCrag as much as any other, while its vicinity to the mountain ridge of\nLammermoor renders the assimilation a probable one.\n\nWe have only to add, that the death of the unfortunate bridegroom by\na fall from horseback has been in the novel transferred to the no less\nunfortunate lover.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n     By Cauk and keel to win your bread,\n     Wi' whigmaleeries for them wha need,\n     Whilk is a gentle trade indeed\n     To carry the gaberlunzie on.\n\n     Old Song.\n\nFEW have been in my secret while I was compiling these narratives, nor\nis it probable that they will ever become public during the life of\ntheir author. Even were that event to happen, I am not ambitious of the\nhonoured distinction, digito monstrari. I confess that, were it safe to\ncherish such dreams at all, I should more enjoy the thought of remaining\nbehind the curtain unseen, like the ingenious manager of Punch and his\nwife Joan, and enjoying the astonishment and conjectures of my audience.\nThen might I, perchance, hear the productions of the obscure Peter\nPattieson praised by the judicious and admired by the feeling,\nengrossing the young and attracting even the old; while the critic\ntraced their fame up to some name of literary celebrity, and the\nquestion when, and by whom, these tales were written filled up the pause\nof conversation in a hundred circles and coteries. This I may never\nenjoy during my lifetime; but farther than this, I am certain, my vanity\nshould never induce me to aspire.\n\nI am too stubborn in habits, and too little polished in manners, to envy\nor aspire to the honours assigned to my literary contemporaries. I could\nnot think a whit more highly of myself were I found worthy to “come in\nplace as a lion” for a winter in the great metropolis. I could not rise,\nturn round, and show all my honours, from the shaggy mane to the tufted\ntail, “roar you an't were any nightingale,” and so lie down again like a\nwell-behaved beast of show, and all at the cheap and easy rate of a\ncup of coffee and a slice of bread and butter as thin as a wafer. And\nI could ill stomach the fulsome flattery with which the lady of the\nevening indulges her show-monsters on such occasions, as she crams her\nparrots with sugar-plums, in order to make them talk before company. I\ncannot be tempted to “come aloft” for these marks of distinction, and,\nlike imprisoned Samson, I would rather remain--if such must be the\nalternative--all my life in the mill-house, grinding for my very bread,\nthan be brought forth to make sport for the Philistine lords and ladies.\nThis proceeds from no dislike, real or affected, to the aristocracy of\nthese realms. But they have their place, and I have mine; and, like\nthe iron and earthen vessels in the old fable, we can scarce come\ninto collision without my being the sufferer in every sense. It may be\notherwise with the sheets which I am now writing. These may be opened\nand laid aside at pleasure; by amusing themselves with the perusal, the\ngreat will excite no false hopes; by neglecting or condemning them, they\nwill inflict no pain; and how seldom can they converse with those whose\nminds have toiled for their delight without doing either the one or the\nother.\n\nIn the better and wiser tone of feeling with Ovid only expresses in one\nline to retract in that which follows, I can address these quires--\n\nParve, nec invideo, sine me, liber, ibis in urbem.\n\nNor do I join the regret of the illustrious exile, that he himself could\nnot in person accompany the volume, which he sent forth to the mart\nof literature, pleasure, and luxury. Were there not a hundred similar\ninstances on record, the rate of my poor friend and school-fellow, Dick\nTinto, would be sufficient to warn me against seeking happiness in the\ncelebrity which attaches itself to a successful cultivator of the fine\narts.\n\nDick Tinto, when he wrote himself artist, was wont to derive his origin\nfrom the ancient family of Tinto, of that ilk, in Lanarkshire, and\noccasionally hinted that he had somewhat derogated from his gentle blood\nin using the pencil for his principal means of support. But if Dick's\npedigree was correct, some of his ancestors must have suffered a more\nheavy declension, since the good man his father executed the necessary,\nand, I trust, the honest, but certainly not very distinguished,\nemployment of tailor in ordinary to the village of Langdirdum in the\nwest.. Under his humble roof was Richard born, and to his father's\nhumble trade was Richard, greatly contrary to his inclination, early\nindentured. Old Mr. Tinto had, however, no reason to congratulate\nhimself upon having compelled the youthful genius of his son to forsake\nits natural bent. He fared like the school-boy who attempts to stop with\nhis finger the spout of a water cistern, while the stream, exasperated\nat this compression, escapes by a thousand uncalculated spurts, and wets\nhim all over for his pains. Even so fared the senior Tinto, when his\nhopeful apprentice not only exhausted all the chalk in making sketches\nupon the shopboard, but even executed several caricatures of his\nfather's best customers, who began loudly to murmur, that it was too\nhard to have their persons deformed by the vestments of the father, and\nto be at the same time turned into ridicule by the pencil of the son.\nThis led to discredit and loss of practice, until the old tailor,\nyielding to destiny and to the entreaties of his son, permitted him to\nattempt his fortune in a line for which he was better qualified.\n\nThere was about this time, in the village of Langdirdum, a peripatetic\nbrother of the brush, who exercised his vocation sub Jove frigido, the\nobject of admiration of all the boys of the village, but especially\nto Dick Tinto. The age had not yet adopted, amongst other unworthy\nretrenchments, that illiberal measure of economy which, supplying by\nwritten characters the lack of symbolical representation, closes one\nopen and easily accessible avenue of instruction and emolument against\nthe students of the fine arts. It was not yet permitted to write upon\nthe plastered doorway of an alehouse, or the suspended sign of an\ninn, “The Old Magpie,” or “The Saracen's Head,” substituting that cold\ndescription for the lively effigies of the plumed chatterer, or the\nturban'd frown of the terrific soldan. That early and more simple age\nconsidered alike the necessities of all ranks, and depicted the symbols\nof good cheer so as to be obvious to all capacities; well judging that a\nman who could not read a syllable might nevertheless love a pot of good\nale as well as his better-educated neighbours, or even as the parson\nhimself. Acting upon this liberal principle, publicans as yet hung forth\nthe painted emblems of their calling, and sign-painters, if they seldom\nfeasted, did not at least absolutely starve.\n\nTo a worthy of this decayed profession, as we have already intimated,\nDick Tinto became an assistant; and thus, as is not unusual among\nheaven-born geniuses in this department of the fine arts, began to paint\nbefore he had any notion of drawing.\n\nHis talent for observing nature soon induced him to rectify the errors,\nand soar above the instructions, of his teacher. He particularly\nshone in painting horses, that being a favourite sign in the Scottish\nvillages; and, in tracing his progress, it is beautiful to observe how\nby degrees he learned to shorten the backs and prolong the legs of these\nnoble animals, until they came to look less like crocodiles, and\nmore like nags. Detraction, which always pursues merit with strides\nproportioned to its advancement, has indeed alleged that Dick once upon\na time painted a horse with five legs, instead of four. I might have\nrested his defence upon the license allowed to that branch of his\nprofession, which, as it permits all sorts of singular and irregular\ncombinations, may be allowed to extend itself so far as to bestow a limb\nsupernumerary on a favourite subject. But the cause of a deceased friend\nis sacred; and I disdain to bottom it so superficially. I have visited\nthe sign in question, which yet swings exalted in the village of\nLangdirdum; and I am ready to depone upon the oath that what has been\nidly mistaken or misrepresented as being the fifth leg of the horse, is,\nin fact, the tail of that quadruped, and, considered with reference to\nthe posture in which he is delineated, forms a circumstance introduced\nand managed with great and successful, though daring, art. The nag\nbeing represented in a rampant or rearing posture, the tail, which is\nprolonged till it touches the ground, appears to form a point d'appui,\nand gives the firmness of a tripod to the figure, without which it would\nbe difficult to conceive, placed as the feet are, how the courser could\nmaintain his ground without tumbling backwards. This bold conception has\nfortunately fallen into the custody of one by whom it is duly valued;\nfor, when Dick, in his more advanced state of proficiency, became\ndubious of the propriety of so daring a deviation to execute a picture\nof the publican himself in exchange for this juvenile production,\nthe courteous offer was declined by his judicious employer, who\nhad observed, it seems, that when his ale failed to do its duty in\nconciliating his guests, one glance at his sign was sure to put them in\ngood humour.\n\nIt would be foreign to my present purpose to trace the steps by which\nDick Tinto improved his touch, and corrected, by the rules of art, the\nluxuriance of a fervid imagination. The scales fell from his eyes on\nviewing the sketches of a contemporary, the Scottish Teniers, as\nWilkie has been deservedly styled. He threw down the brush took up\nthe crayons, and, amid hunger and toil, and suspense and uncertainty,\npursued the path of his profession under better auspices than those of\nhis original master. Still the first rude emanations of his genius, like\nthe nursery rhymes of Pope, could these be recovered, will be dear to\nthe companions of Dick Tinto's youth. There is a tankard and gridiron\npainted over the door of an obscure change-house in the Back Wynd of\nGandercleugh----But I feel I must tear myself from the subject, or dwell\non it too long.\n\nAmid his wants and struggles, Dick Tinto had recourse, like his\nbrethren, to levying that tax upon the vanity of mankind which he could\nnot extract from their taste and liberality--on a word, he painted\nportraits. It was in this more advanced state of proficiency, when Dick\nhad soared above his original line of business, and highly disdained any\nallusion to it, that, after having been estranged for several years,\nwe again met in the village of Gandercleugh, I holding my present\nsituation, and Dick painting copies of the human face divine at a guinea\nper head. This was a small premium, yet, in the first burst of business,\nit more than sufficed for all Dick's moderate wants; so that he occupied\nan apartment at the Wallace Inn, cracked his jest with impunity even\nupon mine host himself, and lived in respect and observance with the\nchambermaid, hostler, and waiter.\n\nThose halcyon days were too serene to last long. When his honour the\nLaird of Gandercleugh, with his wife and three daughters, the minister,\nthe gauger, mine esteemed patron Mr. Jedediah Cleishbotham, and some\nround dozen of the feuars and farmers, had been consigned to immortality\nby Tinto's brush, custom began to slacken, and it was impossible to\nwring more than crowns and half-crowns from the hard hands of the\npeasants whose ambition led them to Dick's painting-room.\n\nStill, though the horizon was overclouded, no storm for some time\nensued. Mine host had Christian faith with a lodger who had been a\ngood paymaster as long as he had the means. And from a portrait of our\nlandlord himself, grouped with his wife and daughters, in the style of\nRubens, which suddenly appeared in the best parlour, it was evident that\nDick had found some mode of bartering art for the necessaries of life.\n\nNothing, however, is more precarious than resources of this nature. It\nwas observed that Dick became in his turn the whetstone of mine host's\nwit, without venturing either at defence or retaliation; that his easel\nwas transferred to a garret-room, in which there was scarce space for\nit to stand upright; and that he no longer ventured to join the weekly\nclub, of which he had been once the life and soul. In short, Dick\nTinto's friends feared that he had acted like the animal called the\nsloth, which, heaving eaten up the last green leaf upon the tree where\nit has established itself, ends by tumbling down from the top, and\ndying of inanition. I ventured to hint this to Dick, recommended his\ntransferring the exercise of his inestimable talent to some other\nsphere, and forsaking the common which he might be said to have eaten\nbare.\n\n“There is an obstacle to my change of residence,” said my friend,\ngrasping my hand with a look of solemnity.\n\n“A bill due to my landlord, I am afraid?” replied I, with heartfelt\nsympathy; “if any part of my slender means can assist in this\nemergence----”\n\n“No, by the soul of Sir Joshua!” answered the generous youth, “I will\nnever involve a friend in the consequences of my own misfortune. There\nis a mode by which I can regain my liberty; and to creep even through a\ncommon sewer is better than to remain in prison.”\n\nI did not perfectly understand what my friend meant. The muse of\npainting appeared to have failed him, and what other goddess he could\ninvoke in his distress was a mystery to me. We parted, however, without\nfurther explanation, and I did not see him until three days after, when\nhe summoned me to partake of the “foy” with which his landlord proposed\nto regale him ere his departure for Edinburgh.\n\nI found Dick in high spirits, whistling while he buckled the small\nknapsack which contained his colours, brushes, pallets, and clean shirt.\nThat he parted on the best terms with mine host was obvious from the\ncold beef set forth in the low parlour, flanked by two mugs of admirable\nbrown stout; and I own my curiosity was excited concerning the means\nthrough which the face of my friend's affairs had been so suddenly\nimproved. I did not suspect Dick of dealing with the devil, and by what\nearthly means he had extricated himself thus happily I was at a total\nloss to conjecture.\n\nHe perceived my curiosity, and took me by the hand. “My friend,” he\nsaid, “fain would I conceal, even from you, the degradation to which\nit has been necessary to submit, in order to accomplish an honourable\nretreat from Gandercleaugh. But what avails attempting to conceal that\nwhich must needs betray itself even by its superior excellence? All\nthe village--all the parish--all the world--will soon discover to what\npoverty has reduced Richard Tinto.”\n\nA sudden thought here struck me. I had observed that our landlord wore,\non that memorable morning, a pair of bran new velveteens instead of his\nancient thicksets.\n\n“What,” said I, drawing my right hand, with the forefinger and thumb\npressed together, nimbly from my right haunch to my left shoulder, “you\nhave condescended to resume the paternal arts to which you were first\nbred--long stitches, ha, Dick?”\n\nHe repelled this unlucky conjecture with a frown and a pshaw, indicative\nof indignant contempt, and leading me into another room, showed me,\nresting against the wall, the majestic head of Sir William Wallace, grim\nas when severed from the trunk by the orders of the Edward.\n\nThe painting was executed on boards of a substantial thickness, and\nthe top decorated with irons, for suspending the honoured effigy upon a\nsignpost.\n\n“There,” he said, “my friend, stands the honour of Scotland, and my\nshame; yet not so--rather the shame of those who, instead of encouraging\nart in its proper sphere, reduce it to these unbecoming and unworthy\nextremities.”\n\nI endeavoured to smooth the ruffled feelings of my misused and indignant\nfriend. I reminded him that he ought not, like the stag in the fable, to\ndespise the quality which had extricated him from difficulties, in\nwhich his talents, as a portrait or landscape painter, had been found\nunavailing. Above all, I praised the execution, as well as conception,\nof his painting, and reminded him that, far from feeling dishonoured by\nso superb a specimen of his talents being exposed to the general view\nof the public, he ought rather to congratulate himself upon the\naugmentation of his celebrity to which its public exhibition must\nnecessarily give rise.\n\n“You are right, my friend--you are right,” replied poor Dick, his eye\nkindling with enthusiasm; “why should I shun the name of an--an--(he\nhesitated for a phrase)--an out-of-doors artist? Hogarth has introduced\nhimself in that character in one of his best engravings; Domenichino,\nor somebody else, in ancient times, Morland in our own, have exercised\ntheir talents in this manner. And wherefore limit to the rich and\nhigher classes alone the delight which the exhibition of works of art is\ncalculated to inspire into all classes? Statues are placed in the\nopen air, why should Painting be more niggardly in displaying her\nmasterpieces than her sister Sculpture? And yet, my friend, we must part\nsuddenly; the carpenter is coming in an hour to put up the--the emblem;\nand truly, with all my philosophy, and your consolatory encouragement\nto boot, I would rather wish to leave Gandercleugh before that operation\ncommences.”\n\nWe partook of our genial host's parting banquet, and I escorted Dick on\nhis walk to Edinburgh. We parted about a mile from the village, just as\nwe heard the distant cheer of the boys which accompanied the mounting\nof the new symbol of the Wallace Head. Dick Tinto mended his pace to get\nout of hearing, so little had either early practice or recent philosophy\nreconciled him to the character of a sign-painter.\n\nIn Edinburgh, Dick's talents were discovered and appreciated, and he\nreceived dinners and hints from several distinguished judges of the fine\narts. But these gentlemen dispensed their criticism more willingly than\ntheir cash, and Dick thought he needed cash more than criticism. He\ntherefore sought London, the universal mart of talent, and where, as is\nusual in general marts of most descriptions, much more of each commodity\nis exposed to sale than can ever find purchasers.\n\nDick, who, in serious earnest, was supposed to have considerable natural\ntalents for his profession, and whose vain and sanguine disposition\nnever permitted him to doubt for a moment of ultimate success, threw\nhimself headlong into the crowd which jostled and struggled for notice\nand preferment. He elbowed others, and was elbowed himself; and finally,\nby dint of intrepidity, fought his way into some notice, painted for\nthe prize at the Institution, had pictures at the exhibition at Somerset\nHouse, and damned the hanging committee. But poor Dick was doomed to\nlose the field he fought so gallantly. In the fine arts, there is scarce\nan alternative betwixt distinguished success and absolute failure; and\nas Dick's zeal and industry were unable to ensure the first, he\nfell into the distresses which, in his condition, were the natural\nconsequences of the latter alternative. He was for a time patronised\nby one or two of those judicious persons who make a virtue of being\nsingular, and of pitching their own opinions against those of the world\nin matters of taste and criticism. But they soon tired of poor Tinto,\nand laid him down as a load, upon the principle on which a spoilt child\nthrows away its plaything. Misery, I fear, took him up, and accompanied\nhim to a premature grave, to which he was carried from an obscure\nlodging in Swallow Street, where he had been dunned by his landlady\nwithin doors, and watched by bailiffs without, until death came to\nhis relief. A corner of the Morning Post noticed his death, generously\nadding, that his manner displayed considerable genius, though his style\nwas rather sketchy; and referred to an advertisement, which announced\nthat Mr. Varnish, a well-known printseller, had still on hand a very\nfew drawings and painings by Richard Tinto, Esquire, which those of\nthe nobility and gentry who might wish to complete their collections of\nmodern art were invited to visit without delay. So ended Dick Tinto! a\nlamentable proof of the great truth, that in the fine arts mediocrity\nis not permitted, and that he who cannot ascend to the very top of the\nladder will do well not to put his foot upon it at all.\n\nThe memory of Tinto is dear to me, from the recollection of the many\nconversations which we have had together, most of them turning upon\nmy present task. He was delighted with my progress, and talked of an\nornamented and illustrated edition, with heads, vignettes, and culs de\nlampe, all to be designed by his own patriotic and friendly pencil.\nHe prevailed upon an old sergeant of invalids to sit to him in the\ncharacter of Bothwell, the lifeguard's-man of Charles the Second, and\nthe bellman of Gandercleugh in that of David Deans. But while he thus\nproposed to unite his own powers with mine for the illustration of\nthese narratives, he mixed many a dose of salutary criticism with the\npanegyrics which my composition was at times so fortunate as to call\nforth.\n\n“Your characters,” he said, “my dear Pattieson, make too much use of\nthe gob box; they patter too much (an elegant phraseology which Dick had\nlearned while painting the scenes of an itinerant company of players);\nthere is nothing in whole pages but mere chat and dialogue.”\n\n“The ancient philosopher,” said I in reply, “was wont to say, 'Speak,\nthat I may know thee'; and how is it possible for an author to introduce\nhis personae dramatis to his readers in a more interesting and effectual\nmanner than by the dialogue in which each is represented as supporting\nhis own appropriate character?”\n\n“It is a false conclusion,” said Tinto; “I hate it, Peter, as I hate\nan unfilled can. I grant you, indeed, that speech is a faculty of some\nvalue in the intercourse of human affairs, and I will not even insist on\nthe doctrine of that Pythagorean toper, who was of opinion that over\na bottle speaking spoiled conversation. But I will not allow that a\nprofessor of the fine arts has occasion to embody the idea of his scene\nin language, in order to impress upon the reader its reality and its\neffect. On the contrary, I will be judged by most of your readers,\nPeter, should these tales ever become public, whether you have not\ngiven us a page of talk for every single idea which two words might have\ncommunicated, while the posture, and manner, and incident, accurately\ndrawn, and brougth out by appropriate colouring, would have preserved\nall that was worthy of preservation, and saved these everlasting 'said\nhe's' and 'said she's,' with which it has been your pleasure to encumber\nyour pages.”\n\nI replied, “That he confounded the operations of the pencil and the pen;\nthat the serene and silent art, as painting has been called by one of\nour first living poets, necessarily appealed to the eye, because it had\nnot the organs for addressing the ear; whereas poetry, or that species\nof composition which approached to it, lay under the necessity of doing\nabsolutely the reverse, and addressed itself to the ear, for the purpose\nof exciting that interest which it could not attain through the medium\nof the eye.”\n\nDick was not a whit staggered by my argument, which he contended was\nfounded on misrepresentation. “Description,” he said, “was to the author\nof a romance exactly what drawing and tinting were to a painter: words\nwere his colours, and, if properly employed, they could not fail to\nplace the scene which he wished to conjure up as effectually before the\nmind's eye as the tablet or canvas presents it to the bodily organ.\nThe same rules,” he contended, “applied to both, and an exuberance\nof dialogue, in the former case, was a verbose and laborious mode\nof composition which went to confound the proper art of fictitious\nnarrative with that of the drama, a widely different species of\ncomposition, of which dialogue was the very essence, because all,\nexcepting the language to be made use of, was presented to the eye by\nthe dresses, and persons, and actions of the performers upon the stage.\nBut as nothing,” said Dick, “can be more dull than a long narrative\nwritten upon the plan of a drama, so where you have approached most near\nto that species of composition, by indulging in prolonged scenes of mere\nconversation, the course of your story has become chill and constrained,\nand you have lost the power of arresting the attention and exciting\nthe imagination, in which upon other occasions you may be considered as\nhaving succeeded tolerably well.”\n\nI made my bow in requital of the compliment, which was probably thrown\nin by way of placebo, and expressed myself willing at least to make one\ntrial of a more straightforward style of composition, in which my actors\nshould do more, and say less, than in my former attempts of this kind.\nDick gave me a patronising and approving nod, and observed that, finding\nme so docile, he would communicate, for the benefit of my muse, a\nsubject which he had studied with a view to his own art.\n\n“The story,” he said, “was, by tradition, affirmed to be truth,\nalthough, as upwards of a hundred years had passed away since the events\ntook place, some doubts upon the accuracy of all the particulars might\nbe reasonably entertained.”\n\nWhen Dick Tinto had thus spoken, he rummaged his portfolio for the\nsketch from which he proposed one day to execute a picture of fourteen\nfeet by eight. The sketch, which was cleverly executed, to use the\nappropriate phrase, represented an ancient hall, fitted up and furnished\nin what we now call the taste of Queen Elizabeth's age. The light,\nadmitted from the upper part of a high casement, fell upon a female\nfigure of exquisite beauty, who, in an attitude of speechless terror,\nappeared to watch the issue of a debate betwixt two other persons. The\none was a young man, in the Vandyke dress common to the time of Charles\nI., who, with an air of indignant pride, testified by the manner in\nwhich he raised his head and extended his arm, seemed to be urging a\nclaim of right, rather than of favour, to a lady whose age, and some\nresemblance in their features, pointed her out as the mother of the\nyounger female, and who appeared to listen with a mixture of displeasure\nand impatience.\n\nTinto produced his sketch with an air of mysterious triumph, and gazed\non it as a fond parent looks upon a hopeful child, while he anticipates\nthe future figure he is to make in the world, and the height to which\nhe will raise the honour of his family. He held it at arm's length\nfrom me--he helt it closer--he placed it upon the top of a chest of\ndrawers--closed the lower shutters of the casement, to adjust a downward\nand favourable light--fell back to the due distance, dragging me\nafter him--shaded his face with his hand, as if to exclude all but the\nfavourite object--and ended by spoiling a child's copy-book, which he\nrolled up so as to serve for the darkened tube of an amateur. I fancy my\nexpressions of enthusiasm had not been in proportion to his own, for he\npresently exclaimed with vehemence: “Mr. Pattieson, I used to think you\nhad an eye in your head.”\n\nI vindicated my claim to the usual allowance of visual organs.\n\n“Yet, on my honour,” said Dick, “I would swear you had been born blind,\nsince you have failed at the first glance to discover the subject and\nmeaning of that sketch. I do not mean to praise my own performance, I\nleave these arts to others; I am sensible of my deficiencies, conscious\nthat my drawing and colouring may be improved by the time I intend\nto dedicate to the art. But the conception--the expression--the\npositions--these tell the story to every one who looks at the sketch;\nand if I can finish the picture without diminution of the original\nconception, the name of Tinto shall no more be smothered by the mists of\nenvy and intrigue.”\n\nI replied: “That I admired the sketch exceedingly; but that to\nunderstand its full merit, I felt it absolutely necessary to be informed\nof the subject.”\n\n“That is the very thing I complain of,” answered Tinto; “you have\naccustomed yourself so much to these creeping twilight details of yours,\nthat you are become incapable of receiving that instant and vivid\nflash of conviction which darts on the mind from seeing the happy and\nexpressive combinations of a single scene, and which gathers from the\nposition, attitude, and countenance of the moment, not only the history\nof the past lives of the personages represented, and the nature of the\nbusiness on which they are immediately engaged, but lifts even the veil\nof futurity, and affords a shrewd guess at their future fortunes.”\n\n“In that case,” replied I, “Paining excels the ape of the renowned Gines\nde Passamonte, which only meddled with the past and the present; nay,\nshe excels that very Nature who affords her subject; for I protest to\nyou, Dick, that were I permitted to peep into that Elizabeth-chamber,\nand see the persons you have sketched conversing in flesh and blood, I\nshould not be a jot nearer guessing the nature of their business than I\nam at this moment while looking at your sketch. Only generally, from\nthe languishing look of the young lady, and the care you have taken\nto present a very handsome leg on the part of the gentleman, I presume\nthere is some reference to a love affair between them.”\n\n“Do you really presume to form such a bold conjecture?” said Tinto. “And\nthe indignant earnestness with which you see the man urge his suit, the\nunresisting and passive despair of the younger female, the stern air of\ninflexible determination in the elder woman, whose looks express at\nonce consciousness that she is acting wrong and a firm determination to\npersist in the course she has adopted----”\n\n“If her looks express all this, my dear Tinto,” replied I, interrupting\nhim, “your pencil rivals the dramatic art of Mr. Puff in The Critic, who\ncrammed a whole complicated sentence into the expressive shake of Lord\nBurleigh's head.”\n\n“My good friend, Peter,” replied Tinto, “I observe you are perfectly\nincorrigible; however, I have compassion on your dulness, and am\nunwilling you should be deprived of the pleasure of understanding my\npicture, and of gaining, at the same time, a subject for your own pen.\nYou must know then, last summer, while I was taking sketches on the\ncoast of East Lothian and Berwickshire, I was seduced into the mountains\nof Lammermoor by the account I received of some remains of antiquity in\nthat district. Those with which I was most struck were the ruins of an\nancient castle in which that Elizabeth-chamber, as you call it,\nonce existed. I resided for two or three days at a farmhouse in the\nneighbourhood, where the aged goodwife was well acquainted with the\nhistory of the castle, and the events which had taken place in it. One\nof these was of a nature so interesting and singular, that my attention\nwas divided between my wish to draw the old ruins in landscape, and\nto represent, in a history-piece, the singular events which have taken\nplace in it. Here are my notes of the tale,” said poor Dick, handing a\nparcel of loose scraps, partly scratched over with his pencil, partly\nwith his pen, where outlines of caricatures, sketches of turrets,\nmills, old gables, and dovecots, disputed the ground with his written\nmemoranda.\n\nI proceeded, however, to decipher the substance of the manuscript\nas well as I could, and move it into the following Tale, in which,\nfollowing in part, though not entirely, my friend Tinto's advice, I\nendeavoured to render my narrative rather descriptive than dramatic. My\nfavourite propensity, however, has at times overcome me, and my persons,\nlike many others in this talking world, speak now what then a great deal\nmore than they act.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n     Well, lord, we have not got that which we have;\n     'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,\n     Being opposites of such repairing nature.\n\n     Henry VI. Part II.\n\nIN the gorge of a pass or mountain glen, ascending from the fertile\nplains of East Lothian, there stood in former times an extensive castle,\nof which only the ruins are now visible. Its ancient proprietors were\na race of powerful and warlike carons, who bore the same name with the\ncastle itself, which was Ravenswood. Their line extended to a remote\nperiod of antiquity, and they had intermarried with the Douglasses,\nHumes, Swintons, Hays, and other families of power and distinction\nin the same country. Their history was frequently involved in that of\nScotland itself, in whose annals their feats are recorded. The Castle of\nRavenswood, occupying, and in some measure commanding, a pass betweixt\nBerwickshire, or the Merse, as the southeastern province of Scotland is\ntermed, and the Lothians, was of importance both in times of foreign\nwar and domestic discord. It was frequently beseiged with ardour, and\ndefended with obstinacy, and, of course, its owners played a conspicuous\npart in story. But their house had its revolutions, like all sublunary\nthings: it became greatly declined from its splendour about the middle\nof the 17th century; and towards the period of the Revolution, the last\nproprietor of Ravenswood Castle saw himself compelled to part with the\nancient family seat, and to remove himself to a lonely and sea-beaten\ntower, which, situated on the bleak shores between St. Abb's Head and\nthe village of Eyemouth, looked out on the lonely and boisterous\nGerman Ocean. A black domain of wild pasture-land surrounded their new\nresidence, and formed the remains of their property.\n\nLord Ravenswood, the heir of this ruined family, was far from bending\nhis mind to his new condition of life. In the civil war of 1689 he\nhad espoused the sinking side, and although he had escaped without the\nforfeiture of life or land, his blood had been attainted, and his title\nabolished. He was now called Lord Ravenswood only in courtesy.\n\nThis forfeited nobleman inherited the pride and turbulence, though not\nthe forture, of his house, and, as he imputed the final declension of\nhis family to a particular individual, he honoured that person with his\nfull portion of hatred. This was the very man who had now become, by\npurchase, proprietor of Ravenswood, and the domains of which the heir of\nthe house now stood dispossessed. He was descended of a family much less\nancient than that of Lord Ravenswood, and which had only risen to wealth\nand political importance during the great civil wars. He himself\nhad been bred to the bar, and had held high offices in the state,\nmaintaining through life the character of a skilful fisher in the\ntroubled waters of a state divided by factions, and governed by\ndelegated authority; and of one who contrived to amass considerable sums\nof money in a country where there was but little to be gathered, and who\nequally knew the value of wealth and the various means of augmenting it\nand using it as an engine of increasing his power and influence.\n\nThus qualified and gifted, he was a dangerous antagonist to the fierce\nand imprudent Ravenswood. Whether he had given him good cause for the\nenmity with which the Baron regarded him, was a point on which men spoke\ndifferently. Some said the quarrel arose merely from the vindictive\nspirit and envy of Lord Ravenswood, who could not patiently behold\nanother, though by just and fair purchase, become the proprietor of\nthe estate and castle of his forefathers. But the greater part of the\npublic, prone to slander the wealthy in their absence as to flatter them\nin their presence, held a less charitable opinion. They said that the\nLord Keeper (for to this height Sir William Ashton had ascended)\nhad, previous to the final purchase of the estate of Ravenswood,\nbeen concerned in extensive pecuniary transactions with the former\nproprietor; and, rather intimating what was probable than affirming\nanything positively, they asked which party was likely to have the\nadvantage in stating and enforcing the claims arising out of these\ncomplicated affairs, and more than hinted the advantages which the cool\nlawyer and able politician must necessarily possess over the hot,\nfiery, and imprudent character whom he had involved in legal toils and\npecuniary snares.\n\nThe character of the times aggravated these suspicions. “In those days\nthere was no king in Israel.” Since the departure of James VI. to assume\nthe richer and more powerful crown of England, there had existed in\nScotland contending parties, formed among the aristocracy, by whom,\nas their intrigues at the court of St. James's chanced to prevail,\nthe delegated powers of sovereignty were alternately swayed. The evils\nattending upon this system of government resembled those which afflict\nthe tenants of an Irish estate, the property of an absentee. There was\nno supreme power, claiming and possessing a general interest with the\ncommunity at large, to whom the oppressed might appeal from subordinate\ntyranny, either for justice or for mercy. Let a monarch be as indolent,\nas selfish, as much disposed to arbitrary power as he will, still, in a\nfree country, his own interests are so clearly connected with those of\nthe public at large, and the evil consequences to his own authority are\nso obvious and imminent when a different course is pursued, that common\npolicy, as well as common feeling, point to the equal distribution of\njustice, and to the establishment of the throne in righteousness. Thus,\neven sovereigns remarkable for usurpation and tyranny have been found\nrigorous in the administration of justice among their subjects, in cases\nwhere their own power and passions were not compromised.\n\nIt is very different when the powers of sovereignty are delegated to\nthe head of an aristocratic faction, rivalled and pressed closely in\nthe race of ambition by an adverse leader. His brief and precarious\nenjoyment of power must be employed in rewarding his partizans, in\nextending his influence, in oppressing and crushing his adversaries.\nEven Abou Hassan, the most disinterested of all viceroys, forgot not,\nduring his caliphate of one day, to send a douceur of one thousand\npieces of gold to his own household; and the Scottish vicegerents,\nraised to power by the strength of their faction, failed not to embrace\nthe same means of rewarding them.\n\nThe administration of justice, in particular, was infected by the most\ngross partiality. A case of importance scarcely occurred in which there\nwas not some ground for bias or partiality on the part of the judges,\nwho were so little able to withstand the temptation that the adage,\n“Show me the man, and I will show you the law,” became as prevalent as\nit was scandalous. One corruption led the way to others still mroe gross\nand profligate. The judge who lent his sacred authority in one case to\nsupport a friend, and in another to crush an enemy, and who decisions\nwere founded on family connexions or political relations, could not be\nsupposed inaccessible to direct personal motives; and the purse of the\nwealthy was too often believed to be thrown into the scale to weigh\ndown the cause of the poor litigant. The subordinate officers of the law\naffected little scruple concerning bribery. Pieces of plate and bags of\nmoney were sent in presents to the king's counsel, to influence their\nconduct, and poured forth, says a contemporary writer, like billets of\nwood upon their floors, without even the decency of concealment.\n\nIn such times, it was not over uncharitable to suppose that the\nstatesman, practised in courts of law, and a powerful member of a\ntriumphant cabal, might find and use means of advantage over his less\nskilful and less favoured adversary; and if it had been supposed that\nSir William Ashton's conscience had been too delicate to profit by these\nadvantages, it was believed that his ambition and desire of extending\nhis wealth and consequence found as strong a stimulus in the\nexhortations of his lady as the daring aim of Macbeth in the days of\nyore.\n\nLady Ashton was of a family more distinguished than that of her lord, an\nadvantage which she did not fail to use to the uttermost, in maintaining\nand extending her husband's influence over others, and, unless she\nwas greatly belied, her own over him. She had been beautiful, and was\nstately and majestic in her appearance. Endowed by nature with strong\npowers and violent passions, experience had taught her to employ the\none, and to conceal, if not to moderate, the other. She was a severe\nadn strict observer of the external forms, at least, of devotion; her\nhospitality was splendid, even to ostentation; her address and manners,\nagreeable to the pattern most valued in Scotland at the period, were\ngrave, dignified, and severely regulated by the rules of etiquette. Her\ncharacter had always been beyond the breath of slander. And yet, with\nall these qualities to excite respect, Lady Ashton was seldom mentioned\nin the terms of love or affection. Interest--the interest of her family,\nif not her own--seemed too obviously the motive of her actions; and\nwhere this is the case, the sharp-judging and malignant public are not\neasily imposed upon by outward show. It was seen and ascertained that,\nin her most graceful courtesies and compliments, Lady Ashton no more\nlost sight of her object than the falcon in his airy wheel turns his\nquick eyes from his destined quarry; and hence, somethign of doubt and\nsuspicion qualified the feelings with which her equals received her\nattentions. With her inferiors these feelings were mingled with fear;\nan impression useful to her purposes, so far as it enforced ready\ncompliance with her requests and implicit obedience to her commands, but\ndetrimental, because it cannot exist with affection or regard.\n\nEven her husband, it is said, upon whose fortunes her talents and\naddress had produced such emphatic influence, regarded her with\nrespectful awe rather than confiding attachment; and report said, there\nwere times when he considered his grandeur as dearly purchased at the\nexpense of domestic thraldom. Of this, however, much might be suspected,\nbut little could be accurately known: Lady Ashton regarded the honour of\nher husband as her own, and was well aware how much that would suffer\nin the public eye should he appear a vassal to his wife. In all her\narguments his opinion was quoted as infallible; his taste was appealed\nto, and his sentiments received, with the air of deference which a\ndutiful wife might seem to owe to a husband of Sir William Ashton's rank\nadn character. But there was something under all this which rung false\nand hollow; and to those who watched this couple with close, and perhaps\nmalicious, scrutiny it seemed evident that, in the haughtiness of\na firmer character, higher birth, and more decided views of\naggrandisement, the lady looked with some contempt on her husband,\nand that he regarded her with jealous fear, rather than with love or\nadmiration.\n\nStill, however, the leading and favourite interests of Sir William\nAshton and his lady were the same, and they failed not to work in\nconcert, although without cordiality, and to testify, in all exterior\ncircumstances, that respect for each other which they were aware was\nnecessary to secure that of the public.\n\nTheir union was crowned with several children, of whom three survived.\nOne, the eldest son, was absent on his travels; the second, a girl of\nseventeen, adn the third, a boy about three years younger, resided\nwith their parents in Edinburgh during the sessions of the Scottish\nParliament and Privy Council, at other times in the old Gothic castle\nof Ravenswood, to which the Lord Keeper had made large additions in the\nstyle of the 17th century.\n\nAllan Lord Ravenswood, the late proprietor of that ancient mansion\nadn the large estate annexed to it, continued for some time to wage\nineffectual war with his successor concerning various points to which\ntheir former transactions had given rise, and which were successively\ndetermined in favour of the wealthy and powerful competitor, until death\nclosed the litigation, by summoning Ravenswood to a higher bar. The\nthread of life, which had been long wasting, gave way during a fit of\nviolent and impotent fury with which he was assailed on receiving the\nnews of the loss of a cause, founded, perhaps, rather in equity than in\nlaw, the last which he had maintained against his powerful antagonist.\nHis son witnessed his dying agonies, and heard the curses which he\nbreathed against his adversary, as if they had conveyed to him a legacy\nof vengeance. Other circumstances happened to exasperate a passion which\nwas, and had long been, a prevalent vice in the Scottish disposition.\n\nIt was a November morning, and the cliffs which overlooked the ocean\nwere hung with thick and heavy mist, when the portals of the ancient\nand half-ruinous tower, in which Lord Ravenswood had spent the last and\ntroubled years of his life, opened, that his mortal remains might pass\nforward to an abode yet more dreary and lonely. The pomp of attendance,\nto which the deceased had, in his latter years, been a stranger, was\nrevived as he was about to be consigned to the realms of forgetfulness.\n\nBanner after banner, with the various devices and coats of this ancient\nfamily and its connexions, followed each other in mournful procession\nfrom under the low-browed archway of the courtyard. The principal gentry\nof the country attended in the deepest mourning, and tempered the\npace of their long train of horses to the solemn march befitting the\noccasion. Trumpets, with banners of crape attached to them, sent\nforth their long and melancholy notes to regulate the movements of the\nprocession. An immense train of inferior mourners and menials closed\nthe rear, which had not yet issued from the castle gate when the van had\nreached the chapel where the body was to be deposited.\n\nContrary to the custom, and even to the law, of the time, the body was\nmet by a priest of the Scottish Episcopal communion, arrayed in his\nsurplice, and prepared to read over the coffin of the deceased the\nfuneral service of the church. Such had been the desire of Lord\nRavenswood in his last illness, and it was readily complied with by the\nTory gentlemen, or Cavaliers, as they affected to style themselves, in\nwhich faction most of his kinsmen were enrolled. The Presbyterian Church\njudicatory of the bounds, considering the ceremony as a bravading insult\nupon their authority, had applied to the Lord Keeper, as the nearest\nprivy councillor, for a warrant to prevent its being carried into\neffect; so that, when the clergyman had opened his prayer-book, an\nofficer of the law, supported by some armed men, commanded him to be\nsilent. An insult which fired the whol assembly with indignation was\nparticularly and instantly resented by the only son of the deceased,\nEdgar, popularly called the Master of Ravenswood, a youth of about\ntwenty years of age. He clapped his hand on his sword, and bidding\nthe official person to desist at his peril from farther interruption,\ncommanded the clergyman to proceed. The man attempted to enforce his\ncommission; but as an hundred swords at once glittered in the air, he\ncontented himself with protesting against the violence which had been\noffered to him in the execution of his duty, and stood aloof, a sullen\nadn moody spectator of the ceremonial, muttering as one who should say:\n“You'll rue the day that clogs me with this answer.”\n\nThe scene was worthy of an artist's pencil. Under the very arch of the\nhouse of death, the clergyman, affrighted at the scene, and trembling\nfor his own safety, hastily and unwillingly rehearsed the solemn service\nof the church, and spoke “dust to dust and ashes to ashes,” over\nruined pride and decayed prosperity. Around stood the relations of the\ndeceased, their countenances more in anger than in sorrow, and the drawn\nswords which they brandished forming a violent contrast with their deep\nmourning habits. In the countenance of the young man alone, resentment\nseemed for the moment overpowered by the deep agony with which he beheld\nhis nearest, and almost his only, friend consigned to the tomb of his\nancestry. A relative observed him turn deadly pale, when, all rites\nbeing now duly observed, it became the duty of the chief mourner to\nlower down into the charnel vault, where mouldering coffins showed their\ntattered velvet and decayed plating, the head of the corpse which was\nto be their partner in corruption. He stept to the youth and offered his\nassistance, which, by a mute motion, Edgar Ravenswood rejected. Firmly,\nand without a tear, he performed that last duty. The stone was laid\non the sepulchre, the door of the aisle was locked, and the youth took\npossession of its massive key.\n\nAs the crowd left the chapel, he paused on the steps which led to its\nGothic chancel. “Gentlemen and friends,” he said, “you have this day\ndone no common duty to the body of your deceased kinsman. The rites of\ndue observance, which, in other countries, are allowed as the due of the\nmeanest Christian, would this day have been denied to the body of your\nrelative--not certainly sprung of the meanest house in Scotland--had\nit not been assured to him by your courage. Others bury their dead in\nsorrow and tears, in silence and in reverence; our funeral rites are\nmarred by the intrusion of bailiffs and ruffians, and our grief--the\ngrief due to our departed friend--is chased from our cheeks by the glow\nof just indignation. But it is well that I know from what quiver this\narrow has come forth. It was only he that dug the drave who could have\nthe mean cruelty to disturb the obsequies; and Heaven do as much to\nme and more, if I requite not to this man and his house the ruin and\ndisgrace he has brought on me and mine!”\n\nA numerous part of the assembly applauded this speech, as the spirited\nexpression of just resentment; but the more cool and judicious regretted\nthat it had been uttered. The fortunes of the heir of Ravenswood were\ntoo low to brave the farther hostility which they imagined these open\nexpressions of resentment must necessarily provoke. Their apprehensions,\nhowever, proved groundless, at least in the immediate consequences of\nthis affair.\n\nThe mourners returned to the tower, there, according to a custom but\nrecently abolished in Scotland, to carouse deep healths to the memory of\nthe deceased, to make the house of sorrow ring with sounds of joviality\nand debauch, and to diminish, by the expense of a large and profuse\nentertainment, the limited revenues of the heir of him whose funeral\nthey thus strangely honoured. It was the custom, however, and on the\npresent occasion it was fully observed. The tables swam in wine,\nthe populace feasted in the courtyard, the yeomen in the kitchen and\nbuttery; and two years' rent of Ravenswood's remaining property hardly\ndefrayed the charge of the funeral revel. The wine did its office on all\nbut the Master of Ravenswood, a title which he still retained, though\nforfeiture had attached to that of his father. He, while passing around\nthe cup which he himself did not taste, soon listened to a thousand\nexclamations against the Lord Keeper, and passionate protestations of\nattachment to himself, and to the honour of his house. He listened\nwith dark and sullen brow to ebullitions which he considered justly as\nequally evanescent with the crimson bubbles on the brink of the goblet,\nor at least with the vapours which its contents excited in the brains of\nthe revellers around him.\n\nWhen the last flask was emptied, they took their leave with deep\nprotestations--to be forgotten on the morrow, if, indeed, those who\nmade them should not think it necessary for their safety to make a more\nsolemn retractation.\n\nAccepting their adieus with an air of contempt which he could scarce\nconceal, Ravenswood at length beheld his ruinous habitation cleared of\ntheir confluence of riotous guests, and returned to the deserted hall,\nwhich now appeared doubly lonely from the cessation of that clamour to\nwhich it had so lately echoed. But its space was peopled by phantoms\nwhich the imagination of the young heir conjured up before him--the\ntarnished honour and degraded fortunes of his house, the destruction\nof his own hopes, and the triumph of that family by whom they had been\nruined. To a mind naturally of a gloomy cast here was ample room\nfor meditation, and the musings of young Ravenswood were deep and\nunwitnessed.\n\nThe peasant who shows the ruins of the tower, which still crown the\nbeetling cliff and behold the war of the waves, though no mroe tenanted\nsaved by the sea-mew and cormorant, even yet affirms that on this\nfatal night the Master of Ravenswood, by the bitter exclamations of his\ndespair, evoked some evil fiend, under whose malignant influence the\nfuture tissue of incidents was woven. Alas! what fiend can suggest more\ndesperate counsels than those adopted under the guidance of our own\nviolent and unresisted passions?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n     Over Gods forebode, then said the King,\n     That thou shouldst shoot at me.\n\n     William Bell, Clim 'o the Cleugh, etc.\n\nOn the morning after the funeral, the legal officer whose authority\nhad been found insufficient to effect an interruption of the funeral\nsolemnities of the late Lord Ravenswood, hastened to state before the\nKeeper the resistance which he had met with in the execution of his\noffice.\n\nThe statesman was seated in a spacious library, once a banqueting-room\nin the old Castle of Ravenswood, as was evident from the armorial\ninsignia still displayed on the carved roof, which was vaulted with\nSpanish chestnut, and on the stained glass of the casement, through\nwhich gleamed a dim yet rich light on the long rows of shelves, bending\nunder the weight of legal commentators and monkish historians, whose\nponderous volumes formed the chief and most valued contents of a\nScottish historian [library] of the period. On the massive oaken\ntable and reading-desk lay a confused mass of letters, petitions, and\nparchments; to toil amongst which was the pleasure at once and the\nplague of Sir William Ashton's life. His appearance was grave and even\nnoble, well becoming one who held an high office in the state; and it\nwas not save after long and intimate conversation with him upon topics\nof pressing and personal interest, that a stranger could have discovered\nsomething vacillating and uncertain in his resolutions; an infirmity of\npurpose, arising from a cautious and timid disposition, which, as he was\nconscious of its internal influence on his mind, he was, from pride as\nwell as policy, most anxious to conceal from others. He listened with\ngreat apparent composure to an exaggerated account of the tumult which\nhad taken place at the funeral, of the contempt thrown on his own\nauthority and that of the church and state; nor did he seem moved even\nby the faithful report of the insulting and threatening language which\nhad been uttered by young Ravenswood and others, and obviously directed\nagainst himself. He heard, also, what the man had been able to collect,\nin a very distorted and aggravated shape, of the toasts which had been\ndrunk, and the menaces uttered, at the subsequent entertainment. In fine,\nhe made careful notes of all these particulars, and of the names of\nthe persons by whom, in case of need, an accusation, founded upon these\nviolent proceedings, could be witnessed and made good, and dismissed his\ninformer, secure that he was now master of the remaining fortune, and\neven of the personal liberty, of young Ravenswood.\n\nWhen the door had closed upon the officer of the law, the Lord Keeper\nremained for a moment in deep meditation; then, starting from his\nseat, paced the apartment as one about to take a sudden and energetic\nresolution. “Young Ravenswood,” he muttered, “is now mine--he is my own;\nhe has placed himself in my hand, and he shall bend or break. I have not\nforgot the determined and dogged obstinacy with which his father fought\nevery point to the last, resisted every effort at compromise, embroiled\nme in lawsuits, and attempted to assail my character when he could\nnot otherwise impugn my rights. This boy he has left behind him--this\nEdgar--this hot-headed, hare-brained fool, has wrecked his vessel before\nshe has cleared the harbor. I must see that he gains no advantage\nof some turning tide which may again float him off. These memoranda,\nproperly stated to the privy council, cannot but be construed into\nan aggravated riot, in which the dignity both of the civil and\necclesiastical authorities stands committed. A heavy fine might be\nimposed; an order for committing him to Edinburgh or Blackness Castle\nseems not improper; even a charge of treason might be laid on many of\nthese words and expressions, though God forbid I should prosecute the\nmatter to that extent. No, I will not; I will not touch his life, even\nif it should be in my power; and yet, if he lives till a change of\ntimes, what follows? Restitution--perhaps revenge. I know Athole\npromised his interest to old Ravenswood, and here is his son already\nbandying and making a faction by his own contemptible influence. What\na ready tool he would be for the use of those who are watching the\ndownfall of our administration!”\n\nWhile these thoughts were agitating the mind of the wily statesman, and\nwhile he was persuading himself that his own interest and safety, as\nwell as those of his friends and party, depended on using the present\nadvantage to the uttermost against young Ravenswood, the Lord Keeper\nsate down to his desk, and proceeded to draw up, for the information of\nthe privy council, an account of the disorderly proceedings which,\nin contempt of his warrant, had taken place at the funeral of Lord\nRavenswood. The names of most of the parties concerned, as well as the\nfact itself, would, he was well aware, sound odiously in the ears of his\ncolleagues in administration, and most likely instigate them to make an\nexample of young Ravenswood, at least, in terrorem.\n\nIt was a point of delicacy, however, to select such expressions as might\ninfer the young man's culpability, without seeming directly to urge\nit, which, on the part of Sir William Ashton, his father's ancient\nantagonist, could not but appear odious and invidious. While he was in\nthe act of composition, labouring to find words which might indicate\nEdgar Ravenswood to be the cause of the uproar, without specifically\nmaking such a charge, Sir William, in a pause of his task, chanced, in\nlooking upward, to see the crest of the family for whose heir he was\nwhetting the arrows and disposing the toils of the law carved upon one\nof the corbeilles from which the vaulted roof of the apartment sprung.\nIt was a black bull's head, with the legend, “I bide my time”; and\nthe occasion upon which it was adopted mingled itself singularly and\nimpressively with the subject of his present reflections.\n\nIt was said by a constant tradition that a Malisius de Ravenswood had,\nin the 13th century, been deprived of his castle and lands by a powerful\nusurper, who had for a while enjoyed his spoils in quiet. At length,\non the eve of a costly banquet, Ravenswood, who had watched his\nopportunity, introduced himself into the castle with a small band of\nfaithful retainers. The serving of the expected feast was impatiently\nlooked for by the guests, and clamorously demanded by the temporary\nmaster of the castle. Ravenswood, who had assumed the disguise of a\nsewer upon the occasion, answered, in a stern voice, “I bide my time”;\nand at the same moment a bull's head, the ancient symbol of death, was\nplaced upon the table. The explosion of the conspiracy took place upon\nthe signal, and the usurper and his followers were put to death. Perhaps\nthere was something in this still known and often repeated story which\ncame immediately home to the breast and conscience of the Lord Keeper;\nfor, putting from him the paper on which he had begun his report, and\ncarefully locking the memoranda which he had prepared into a cabinet\nwhich stood beside him, he proceeded to walk abroad, as if for\nthe purpose of collecting his ideas, and reflecting farther on the\nconsequences of the step which he was about to take, ere yet they became\ninevitable.\n\nIn passing through a large Gothic ante-room, Sir William Ashton heard\nthe sound of his daughter's lute. Music, when the performers are\nconcealed, affects us with a pleasure mingled with surprise, and\nreminds us of the natural concert of birds among the leafy bowers. The\nstatesman, though little accustomed to give way to emotions of this\nnatural and simple class, was still a man and a father. He stopped,\ntherefore, and listened, while the silver tones of Lucy Ashton's voice\nmingled with the accompaniment in an ancient air, to which some one had\nadapted the following words:\n\n     “Look not thou on beauty's charming,\n     Sit thou still when kings are arming,\n     Taste not when the wine-cup glistens,\n     Speak not when the people listens,\n     Stop thine ear against the singer,\n     From the red gold keep they finger,\n     Vacant heart, and hand, and eye,\n     Easy live and quiet die.”\n\nThe sounds ceased, and the Keeper entered his daughter's apartment.\n\nThe words she had chosen seemed particularly adapted to her character;\nfor Lucy Ashton's exquisitely beautiful, yet somewhat girlish features\nwere formed to express peace of mind, serenity, and indifference to\nthe tinsel of wordly pleasure. Her locks, which were of shadowy gold,\ndivided on a brow of exquisite whiteness, like a gleam of broken and\npallid sunshine upon a hill of snow. The expression of the countenance\nwas in the last degree gentle, soft, timid, and feminine, and seemed\nrather to shrink from the most casual look of a stranger than to court\nhis admiration. Something there was of a Madonna cast, perhaps the\nresult of delicate health, and of residence in a family where the\ndispositions of the inmates were fiercer, more active, and energetic\nthan her own.\n\nYet her passiveness of disposition was by no means owing to an\nindifferent or unfeeling mind. Left to the impulse of her own taste and\nfeelings, Lucy Ashton was peculiarly accessible to those of a romantic\ncast. Her secret delight was in the old legendary tales of ardent\ndevotion and unalterable affection, chequered as they so often are with\nstrange adventures and supernatural horrors. This was her favoured\nfairy realm, and here she erected her aerial palaces. But it was only\nin secret that she laboured at this delusive though delightful\narchitecture. In her retired chamber, or in the woodland bower which\nshe had chosen for her own, and called after her name, she was in fancy\ndistributing the prizes at the tournament, or raining down influence\nfrom her eyes on the valiant combatants: or she was wandering in the\nwilderness with Una, under escort of the generous lion; or she was\nidentifying herself with the simple yet noble-minded Miranda in the isle\nof wonder and enchantment.\n\nBut in her exterior relations to things of this world, Lucy willingly\nreceived the ruling impulse from those around her. The alternative was,\nin general, too indifferent to her to render resistance desirable, and\nshe willingly found a motive for decision in the opinion of her friends\nwhich perhaps she might have sought for in vain in her own choice.\nEvery reader must have observed in some family of his acquaintance some\nindividual of a temper soft and yielding, who, mixed with stronger and\nmore ardent minds, is borne along by the will of others, with as little\npower of opposition as the flower which is flung into a running stream.\nIt usually happens that such a compliant and easy disposition, which\nresigns itself without murmur to the guidance of others, becomes the\ndarling of those to whose inclinations its own seem to be offered, in\nungrudging and ready sacrifice. This was eminently the case with Lucy\nAshton. Her politic, wary, and wordly father felt for her an affection\nthe strength of which sometimes surprised him into an unusual emotion.\nHer elder brother, who trode the path of ambition with a haughtier step\nthan his father, had also more of human affection. A soldier, and in\na dissolute age, he preferred his sister Lucy even to pleasure and to\nmilitary preferment and distinction. Her younger brother, at an age when\ntrifles chiefly occupied his mind, made her the confidante of all his\npleasures and anxieties, his success in field-sports, and his quarrels\nwith his tutor and instructors. To these details, however trivial, Lucy\nlent patient and not indifferent attention. They moved and interested\nHenry, and that was enough to secure her ear.\n\nHer mother alone did not feel that distinguished and predominating\naffection with which the rest of the family cherished Lucy. She regarded\nwhat she termed her daughter's want of spirit as a decided mark that the\nmore plebeian blood of her father predominated in Lucy's veins, and used\nto call her in derision her Lammermoor Shepherdess. To dislike so gentle\nand inoffensive a being was impossible; but Lady Ashton preferred her\neldest son, on whom had descended a large portion of her own ambitious\nand undaunted disposition, to a daughter whose softness of temper seemed\nallied to feebleness of mind. Her eldest son was the more partially\nbeloved by his mother because, contrary to the usual custom of Scottish\nfamilies of distinction, he had been named after the head of the house.\n\n“My Sholto,” she said, “will support the untarnished honour of his\nmaternal house, and elevate and support that of his father. Poor Lucy\nis unfit for courts or crowded halls. Some country laird must be her\nhusband, rich enough to supply her with every comfort, without an effort\non her own part, so that she may have nothing to shed a tear for but the\ntender apprehension lest he may break his neck in a foxchase. It was\nnot so, however, that our house was raised, nor is it so that it can be\nfortified and augmented. The Lord Keeper's dignity is yet new; it must\nbe borne as if we were used to its weight, worthy of it, and prompt\nto assert and maintain it. Before ancient authorities men bend from\ncustomary and hereditary deference; in our presence they will stand\nerect, unless they are compelled to prostrate themselves. A daughter\nfit for the sheepfold or the cloister is ill qualified to exact respect\nwhere it is yielded with reluctance; and since Heaven refused us a third\nboy, Lucy should have held a character fit to supply his place. The\nhour will be a happy one which disposes her hand in marriage to some one\nwhose energy is greater than her own, or whose ambition is of as low an\norder.”\n\nSo meditated a mother to whom the qualities of her children's hearts,\nas well as the prospect of their domestic happiness, seemed light in\ncomparison to their rank and temporal greatness. But, like many a parent\nof hot and impatient character, she was mistaken in estimating\nthe feelings of her daughter, who, under a semblance of extreme\nindifference, nourished the germ of those passions which sometimes\nspring up in one night, like the gourd of the prophet, and astonish\nthe observer by their unexpected ardour and intensity. In fact, Lucy's\nsentiments seemed chill because nothing had occurred to interest or\nawaken them. Her life had hitherto flowed on in a uniform and gentle\ntenor, and happy for her had not its present smoothness of current\nresembled that of the stream as it glides downwards to the waterfall!\n\n“So, Lucy,” said her father, entering as her song was ended, “does your\nmusical philosopher teach you to contemn the world before you know it?\nThat is surely something premature. Or did you but speak according to\nthe fashion of fair maidens, who are always to hold the pleasures of\nlife in contempt till they are pressed upon them by the address of some\ngentle knight?”\n\nLucy blushed, disclaimed any inference respecting her own choice\nbeing drawn from her selection of a song, and readily laid aside her\ninstrument at her father's request that she would attend him in his\nwalk.\n\nA large and well-wooded park, or rather chase, stretched along the\nhill behind the castle, which, occupying, as we have noticed, a pass\nascending from the plain, seemed built in its very gorge to defend\nthe forest ground which arose behind it in shaggy majesty. Into this\nromantic region the father and daughter proceeded, arm in arm, by a\nnoble avenue overarched by embowering elms, beneath which groups of the\nfallow-deer were seen to stray in distant perspective. As they paced\nslowly on, admiring the different points of view, for which Sir\nWilliam Ashton, notwithstanding the nature of his usual avocations, had\nconsiderable taste and feeling, they were overtaken by the forester,\nor park-keeper, who, intent on silvan sport, was proceeding with his\ncrossbow over his arm, and a hound led in leash by his boy, into the\ninterior of the wood.\n\n“Going to shoot us a piece of venison, Norman?” said his master, as he\nreturned the woodsman's salutation.\n\n“Saul, your honour, and that I am. Will it please you to see the sport?”\n\n“Oh no,” said his lordship, after looking at his daughter, whose colour\nfled at the idea of seeing the deer shot, although, had her father\nexpressed his wish that they should accompany Norman, it was probable\nshe would not even have hinted her reluctance.\n\nThe forester shrugged his shoulders. “It was a disheartening thing,”\n he said, “when none of the gentles came down to see the sport. He\nhoped Captain Sholto would be soon hame, or he might shut up his shop\nentirely; for Mr. Harry was kept sae close wi' his Latin nonsense that,\nthough his will was very gude to be in the wood from morning till night,\nthere would be a hopeful lad lost, and no making a man of him. It was\nnot so, he had heard, in Lord Ravenswood's time: when a buck was to be\nkilled, man and mother's son ran to see; and when the deer fell, the\nknife was always presented to the knight, and he never gave less than\na dollar for the compliment. And there was Edgar Ravenswood--Master of\nRavenswood that is now--when he goes up to the wood--there hasna been a\nbetter hunter since Tristrem's time--when Sir Edgar hauds out, down goes\nthe deer, faith. But we hae lost a' sense of woodcraft on this side of\nthe hill.”\n\nThere was much in this harangue highly displeasing to the Lord Keeper's\nfeelings; he could not help observing that his menial despised him\nalmost avowedly for not possessing that taste for sport which in those\ntimes was deemed the natural and indispensable attribute of a real\ngentleman. But the master of the game is, in all country houses, a man\nof great importance, and entitled to use considerable freedom of speech.\nSir William, therefore, only smiled and replied, “He had something else\nto think upon to-day than killing deer”; meantime, taking out his purse,\nhe gave the ranger a dollar for his encouragement. The fellow received\nit as the waiter of a fashionable hotel receives double his proper fee\nfrom the hands of a country gentleman--that is, with a smile, in which\npleasure at the gift is mingled with contempt for the ignorance of the\ndonor. “Your honour is the bad paymaster,” he said, “who pays before it\nis done. What would you do were I to miss the buck after you have paid\nme my wood-fee?”\n\n“I suppose,” said the Keeper, smiling, “you would hardly guess what I\nmean were I to tell you of a condictio indebiti?”\n\n“Not I, on my saul. I guess it is some law phrase; but sue a beggar,\nand--your honour knows what follows. Well, but I will be just with\nyou, and if bow and brach fail not, you shall have a piece of game two\nfingers fat on the brisket.”\n\nAs he was about to go off, his master again called him, and asked, as\nif by accident, whether the Master of Ravenswood was actually so brave a\nman and so good a shooter as the world spoke him.\n\n“Brave!--brave enough, I warrant you,” answered Norman. “I was in the\nwood at Tyninghame when there was a sort of gallants hunting with my\nlord; on my saul, there was a buck turned to bay made us all stand\nback--a stout old Trojan of the first head, ten-tyned branches, and a\nbrow as broad as e'er a bullock's. Egad, he dashed at the old lord, and\nthere would have been inlake among the perrage, if the Master had not\nwhipt roundly in, and hamstrung him with his cutlass. He was but sixteen\nthen, bless his heart!”\n\n“And is he as ready with the gun as with the couteau?” said Sir William.\n\n“He'll strike this silver dollar out from between my finger and thumb at\nfourscore yards, and I'll hold it out for a gold merk; what more would\nye have of eye, hand, lead, and gunpowder?” “Oh, no more to be wished,\ncertainly,” said the Lord Keeper; “but we keep you from your sport,\nNorman. Good morrow, good Norman.”\n\nAnd, humming his rustic roundelay, the yeoman went on his road, the\nsound of his rough voice gradually dying away as the distance betwixt\nthem increased:\n\n     “The monk must arise when the matins ring,\n     The abbot may sleep to their chime;\n     But the yeoman must start when the bugles sing\n     'Tis time, my hearts, 'tis time.\n\n     There's bucks and raes on Bilhope braes,\n     There's a herd on Shortwood Shaw;\n     But a lily-white doe in the garden goes,\n     She's fairly worth them a'.”\n\n“Has this fellow,” said the Lord Keeper, when the yeoman's song had died\non the wind, “ever served the Ravenswood people, that he seems so much\ninterested in them? I suppose you know, Lucy, for you make it a point\nof conscience to record the special history of every boor about the\ncastle.”\n\n“I am not quite so faithful a chronicler, my dear father; but I\nbelieve that Norman once served here while a boy, and before he went to\nLedington, whence you hired him. But if you want to know anything of the\nformer family, Old Alice is the best authority.”\n\n“And what should I have to do with them, pray, Lucy,” said her father,\n“or with their history or accomplishments?”\n\n“Nay, I do not know, sir; only that you were asking questions of Norman\nabout young Ravenswood.”\n\n“Pshaw, child!” replied her father, yet immediately added: “And who is\nOld Alice? I think you know all the old women in the country.”\n\n“To be sure I do, or how could I help the old creatures when they are\nin hard times? And as to Old Alice, she is the very empress of old women\nand queen of gossips, so far as legendary lore is concerned. She is\nblind, poor old soul, but when she speaks to you, you would think she\nhas some way of looking into your very heart. I am sure I often cover\nmy face, or turn it away, for it seems as if she saw one change colour,\nthough she has been blind these twenty years. She is worth visiting,\nwere it but to say you have seen a blind and paralytic old woman have so\nmuch acuteness of perception and dignity of manners. I assure you, she\nmight be a countess from her language and behaviour. Come, you must go\nto see Alice; we are not a quarter of a mile from her cottage.”\n\n“All this, my dear,” said the Lord Keeper, “is no answer to my\nquestion, who this woman is, and what is her connexion with the former\nproprietor's family?”\n\n“Oh, it was somethign of a nouriceship, I believe; and she remained\nhere, because her two grandsons were engaged in your service. But it\nwas against her will, I fancy; for the poor old creature is always\nregretting the change of times and of property.”\n\n“I am much obliged to her,” answered the Lord Keeper. “She and her folk\neat my bread and drink my cup, and are lamenting all the while that\nthey are not still under a family which never could do good, either to\nthemselves or any one else!”\n\n“Indeed,” replied Lucy, “I am certain you do Old Alice injustice.\nShe has nothing mercenary about her, and would not accept a penny\nin charity, if it were to save her from being starved. She is only\ntalkative, like all old folk when you put them upon stories of their\nyouth; and she speaks about the Ravenswood people, because she lived\nunder them so many years. But I am sure she is grateful to you, sir,\nfor your protection, and that she would rather speak to you than to\nany other person in the whole world beside. Do, sir, come and see Old\nAlice.”\n\nAnd with the freedom of an indulged daughter she dragged the Lord Keeper\nin the direction she desired.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n     Through tops of the high trees she did descry\n     A little smoke, whose vapour, thin and light,\n     Reeking aloft, uprolled to the sky,\n     Which cheerful sign did send unto her sight,\n     That in the same did wonne some living wight.\n\n     SPENSER.\n\nLUCY acted as her father's guide, for he was too much engrossed with his\npolitical labours, or with society, to be perfectly acquainted with his\nown extensive domains, and, moreover, was generally an inhabitant of\nthe city of Edinburgh; and she, on the other hand, had, with her mother,\nresided the whole summer in Ravenswood, and, partly from taste, partly\nfrom want of any other amusement, had, by her frequent rambles, learned\nto know each lane, alley, dingle, or bushy dell,\n\n\n     And every bosky bourne from side to side.\n\n\nWe have said that the Lord Keeper was not indifferent to the beauties\nof nature; and we add, in justice to him, that he felt them doubly when\npointed out by the beautiful, simple, and interesting girl who, hanging\non his arm with filial kindness, now called him to admire the size of\nsome ancient oak, and now the unexpected turn where the path, developing\nits maze from glen or dingle, suddenly reached an eminence commanding\nan extensive view of the plains beneath them, and then gradually glided\naway from the prospect to lose itself among rocks and thickets, and\nguide to scenes of deeper seclusion.\n\nIt was when pausing on one of those points of extensive and commanding\nview that Lucy told her father they were close by the cottage of her\nblind protegee; and on turning from the little hill, a path which led\naround it, worn by the daily steps of the infirm inmate, brought them in\nsight of the hut, which, embosomed in a deep and obscure dell, seemed\nto have been so situated purposely to bear a correspondence with the\ndarkened state of its inhabitant.\n\nThe cottage was situated immediately under a tall rock, which in\nsome measure beetled over it, as if threatening to drop some detached\nfragment from its brow on the frail tenement beneath. The hut itself was\nconstructed of turf and stones, and rudely roofed over with thatch, much\nof which was in a dilapidated condition. The thin blue smoke rose from\nit in a light column, and curled upward along the white face of the\nincumbent rock, giving the scene a tint of exquisite softness. In a\nsmall and rude garden, surrounded by straggling elder-bushes, which\nformed a sort of imperfect hedge, sat near to the beehives, by the\nproduce of which she lived, that “woman old” whom Lucy had brought her\nfather hither to visit.\n\nWhatever there had been which was disastrous in her fortune, whatever\nthere was miserable in her dwelling, it was easy to judge by the first\nglance that neither years, poverty, misfortune, nor infirmity had broken\nthe spirit of this remarkable woman.\n\nShe occupied a turf seat, placed under a weeping birch of unusual\nmagnitude and age, as Judah is represented sitting under her palm-tree,\nwith an air at once of majesty and of dejection. Her figure was tall,\ncommanding, and but little bent by the infirmities of old age. Her\ndress, though that of a peasant, was uncommonly clean, forming in that\nparticular a strong contrast to most of her rank, and was disposed with\nan attention to neatness, and even to taste, equally unusual. But it was\nher expression of countenance which chiefly struck the spectator, and\ninduced most persons to address her with a degree of deference and\ncivility very inconsistent with the miserable state of her dwelling, and\nwhich, nevertheless, she received with that easy composure which showed\nshe felt it to be her due. She had once been beautiful, but her beauty\nhad been of a bold and masculine cast, such as does not survive the\nbloom of youth; yet her features continued to express strong sense, deep\nreflection, and a character of sober pride, which, as we have already\nsaid of her dress, appeared to argue a conscious superiority to those\nof her own rank. It scarce seemed possible that a face, deprived of the\nadvantage of sight, could have expressed character so strongly; but her\neyes, which were almost totally closed, did not, by the display of their\nsightless orbs, mar the countenance to which they could add nothing. She\nseemed in a ruminating posture, soothed, perhaps, by the murmurs of the\nbusy tribe around her to abstraction, though not to slumber.\n\nLucy undid the latch of the little garden gate, and solicited the old\nwoman's attention. “My father, Alice, is come to see you.”\n\n“He is welcome, Miss Ashton, and so are you,” said the old woman,\nturning and inclining her head towards her visitors.\n\n“This is a fine morning for your beehives, mother,” said the Lord\nKeeper, who, struck with the outward appearance of Alice, was somewhat\ncurious to know if her conversation would correspond with it.\n\n“I believe so, my lord,” she replied; “I feel the air breathe milder\nthan of late.”\n\n“You do not,” resumed the statesman, “take charge of these bees\nyourself, mother? How do you manage them?”\n\n“By delegates, as kings do their subjects,” resumed Alice; “and I am\nfortunate in a prime minister. Here, Babie.”\n\nShe whistled on a small silver call which ung around her neck, and which\nat that time was sometimes used to summon domestics, and Babie, a girl\nof fifteen, made her appearance from the hut, not altogether so cleanly\narrayed as she would probably have been had Alice had the use of her\nyees, but with a greater air of neatness than was upon the whole to have\nbeen expected.\n\n“Babie,” said her mistress, “offer some bread and honey to the Lord\nKeeper and Miss Ashton; they will excuse your awkwardness if you use\ncleanliness and despatch.”\n\nBabie performed her mistress's command with the grace which was\nnaturally to have been expected, moving to and fro with a lobster-like\ngesture, her feet and legs tending one way, while her head, turned in\na different direction, was fixed in wonder upon the laird, who was more\nfrequently heard of than seen by his tenants and dependants. The bread\nand honey, however, deposited on a plantain leaf, was offered and\naccepted in all due courtesy. The Lord Keeper, still retaining the place\nwhich he had occupied on the decayed trunk of a fallen tree, looked\nas if he wished to prolong the interview, but was at a loss how to\nintroduce a suitable subject.\n\n“You have been long a resident on this property?” he said, after a\npause.\n\n“It is now nearly sixty years since I first knew Ravenswood,” answered\nthe old dame, whose conversation, though perfectly civil and respectful,\nseemed cautiously limited to the unavoidable and necessary task of\nreplying to Sir William.\n\n“You are not, I should judge by your accent, of this country\noriginally?” said the Lord Keeper, in continuation.\n\n“No; I am by birth an Englishwoman.” “Yet you seem attached to this\ncountry as if it were your own.”\n\n“It is here,” replied the blind woman, “that I have drank the cup of joy\nand of sorrow which Heaven destined for me. I was here the wife of an\nupright and affectionate husband for more than twenty years; I was here\nthe mother of six promising children; it was here that God deprived me\nof all these blessings; it was here they died, and yonder, by yon ruined\nchapel, they lie all buried. I had no country but theirs while they\nlived; I have none but theirs now they are no more.”\n\n“But your house,” said the Lord Keeper, looking at it, “is miserably\nruinous?”\n\n“Do, my dear father,” said Lucy, eagerly, yet bashfully, catching at the\nhint, “give orders to make it better; that is, if you think it proper.”\n\n“It will last my time, my dear Miss Lucy,” said the blind woman; “I\nwould not have my lord give himself the least trouble about it.”\n\n“But,” said Lucy, “you once had a much better house, and were rich, and\nnow in your old age to live in this hovel!”\n\n“It is as good as I deserve, Miss Lucy; if my heart has not broke with\nwhat I have suffered, and seen others suffer, it must have been strong\nenough, adn the rest of this old frame has no right to call itself\nweaker.”\n\n“You have probably witnessed many changes,” said the Lord Keeper; “but\nyour experience must have taught you to expect them.”\n\n“It has taught me to endure them, my lord,” was the reply.\n\n“Yet you knew that they must needs arrive in the course of years?” said\nthe statesman.\n\n“Ay; as I knew that the stump, on or beside which you sit, once a tall\nand lofty tree, must needs one day fall by decay, or by the axe; yet\nI hoped my eyes might not witness the downfall of the tree which\novershadowed my dwelling.”\n\n“Do not suppose,” said the Lord Keeper, “that you will lose any interest\nwith me for looking back with regret to the days when another family\npossessed my estates. You had reason, doubtless, to love them, and I\nrespect your gratitude. I will order some repairs in your cottage, and I\nhope we shall live to be friends when we know each other better.” “Those\nof my age,” returned the dame, “make no new friends. I thank you for\nyour bounty, it is well intended undoubtedly; but I have all I want, and\nI cannot accept more at your lordship's hand.”\n\n“Well, then,” continued the Lord Keeper, “at least allow me to say,\nthat I look upon you as a woman of sense and education beyond your\nappearance, and that I hope you will continue to reside on this property\nof mine rent-free for your life.”\n\n“I hope I shall,” said the old dame, composedly; “I believe that was\nmade an article in the sale of Ravenswood to your lordship, though such\na trifling circumstance may have escaped your recollection.”\n\n“I remember--I recollect,” said his lordship, somewhat confused. “I\nperceive you are too much attached to your old friends to accept any\nbenefit from their successor.”\n\n“Far from it, my lord; I am grateful for the benefits which I decline,\nand I wish I could pay you for offering them, better than what I am now\nabout to say.” The Lord Keeper looked at her in some surprise, but said\nnot a word. “My lord,” she continued, in an impressive and solemn tone,\n“take care what you do; you are on the brink of a precipice.”\n\n“Indeed?” said the Lord Keeper, his mind reverting to the political\ncircumstances of the country. “Has anything come to your knowledge--any\nplot or conspiracy?”\n\n“No, my lord; those who traffic in such commodities do not call to their\ncouncils the old, blind, and infirm. My warning is of another kind. You\nhave driven matters hard with the house of Ravenswood. Believe a true\ntale: they are a fierce house, and there is danger in dealing with men\nwhen they become desperate.”\n\n“Tush,” answered the Keeper; “what has been between us has been the work\nof the law, not my doing; and to the law they must look, if they would\nimpugn my proceedings.”\n\n“Ay, but they may think otherwise, and take the law into their own hand,\nwhen they fail of other means of redress.”\n\n“What mean you?” said the Lord Keeper. “Young Ravenswood would not have\nrecourse to personal violence?”\n\n“God forbid I should say so! I know nothing of the youth but what is\nhonourable and open. Honourable and open, said I? I should have added,\nfree, generous, noble. But he is still a Ravenswood, and may bide his\ntime. Remember the fate of Sir George Lockhart.”\n\nThe Lord Keeper started as she called to his recollection a tragedy\nso deep and so recent. The old woman proceeded: “Chiesley, who did the\ndeed, was a relative of Lord Ravenswood. In the hall of Ravenswood, in\nmy presence and in that of others, he avowed publicly his determination\nto do the cruelty which he afterwards committed. I could not keep\nsilence, though to speak it ill became my station. 'You are devising a\ndreadful crime,' I said, 'for which you must reckon before the judgment\nseat.' Never shall I forget his look, as he replied, 'I must reckon then\nfor many things, and will reckon for this also.' Therefore I may well\nsay, beware of pressing a desperate man with the hand of authority.\nThere is blood of Chiesley in the veins of Ravenswood, and one drop of\nit were enough to fire him in the circumstances in which he is placed. I\nsay, beware of him.”\n\nThe old dame had, either intentionally or by accident, harped aright\nthe fear of the Lord Keeper. The desperate and dark resource of private\nassassination, so familiar to a Scottish baron in former times, had even\nin the present age been too frequently resorted to under the pressure of\nunusual temptation, or where the mind of the actor was prepared for\nsuch a crime. Sir William Ashton was aware of this; as also that young\nRavenswood had received injuries sufficient to prompt him to that sort\nof revenge, which becomes a frequent though fearful consequence of the\npartial administration of justice. He endeavoured to disguise from\nAlice the nature of the apprehensions which he entertained; but so\nineffectually, that a person even of less penetration than nature had\nendowed her with must necessarily have been aware that the subject lay\nnear his bosom. His voice was changed in its accent as he replied to\nher, “That the Master of Ravenswood was a man of honour; and, were it\notherwise, that the fate of Chiesley of Dalry was a sufficient warning\nto any one who should dare to assume the office of avenger of his own\nimaginary wrongs.” And having hastily uttered these expressions, he rose\nand left the place without waiting for a reply.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n     Is she a Capulet?\n     O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.\n\n     SHAKESPEARE\n\nTHE Lord Keeper walked for nearly a quarter of a mile in profound\nsilence. His daughter, naturally timid, and bred up in those ideas of\nfilial awe and implicit obedience which were inculcated upon the youth\nof that period, did not venture to interrupt his meditations.\n\n“Why do you look so pale, Lucy?” said her father, turning suddenly round\nand breaking silence.\n\nAccording to the ideas of the time, which did not permit a young woman\nto offer her sentiments on any subject of importance unless required to\ndo so, Lucy was bound to appear ignorant of the meaning of all that\nhad passed betwixt Alice and her father, and imputed the emotion he had\nobserved to the fear of the wild cattle which grazed in that part of the\nextensive chase through which they were now walking.\n\nOf these animals, the descendants of the savage herds which anciently\nroamed free in the Caledonian forests, it was formerly a point of\nstate to preserve a few in the parks of the Scottish nobility. Specimens\ncontinued within the memory of man to be kept at least at three houses\nof distinction--Hamilton, namely, Drumlanrig, and Cumbernauld. They had\ndegenerated from the ancient race in size and strength, if we are to\njudge from the accounts of old chronicles, and from the formidable\nremains frequently discovered in bogs and morasses when drained and laid\nopen. The bull had lost the shaggy honours of his mane, and the race was\nsmall and light made, in colour a dingy white, or rather a pale yellow,\nwith black horns and hoofs. They retained, however, in some measure,\nthe ferocity of their ancestry, could not be domesticated on account\nof their antipathy to the human race, and were often dangerous if\napproached unguardedly, or wantonly disturbed. It was this last reason\nwhich has occasioned their being extirpated at the places we have\nmentioned, where probably they would otherwise have been retained as\nappropriate inhabitants of a Scottish woodland, and fit tenants for\na baronial forest. A few, if I mistake not, are still preserved\nat Chillingham Castle, in Northumberland, the seat of the Earl of\nTankerville.\n\nIt was to her finding herself in the vicinity of a group of three or\nfour of these animals, that Lucy thought proper to impute those signs of\nfear which had arisen in her countenance for a different reason. For she\nhad been familiarised with the appearance of the wil cattle during her\nwalks in the chase; and it was not then, as it may be now, a necessary\npart of a young lady's demeanour to indulge in causeless tremors of the\nnerves. On the present occasion, however, she speedily found cause for\nreal terror.\n\nLucy had scarcely replied to her father in the words we have mentioned,\nand he was just about to rebuke her supposed timidity, when a bull,\nstimulated either by the scarlet colour of Miss Ashton's mantle, or by\none of those fits of capricious ferocity to which their dispositions are\nliable, detached himself suddenly from the group which was feeding at\nthe upper extremity of a grassy glade, that seemed to lose itself among\nthe crossing and entangled boughs. The animal approached the intruders\non his pasture ground, at first slowly, pawing the ground with his hoof,\nbellowing from time to time, and tearing up the sand with his horns, as\nif to lash himself up to rage and violence.\n\nThe Lord Keeper, who observed the animal's demeanour, was aware that he\nwas about to become mischievous, and, drawing his daughter's arm under\nhis own, began to walk fast along the avenue, in hopes to get out of his\nsight and his reach. This was the most injudicious course he could have\nadopted, for, encouraged by the appearance of flight, the bull began\nto pursue them at full speed. Assailed by a danger so imminent, firmer\ncourage than that of the Lord Keeper might have given way. But paternal\ntenderness, “love strong as death,” sustained him. He continued to\nsupport and drag onward his daughter, until her fears altogether\ndepriving her of the power of flight, she sunk down by his side; and\nwhen he could no longer assist her to escape, he turned round and placed\nhimself betwixt her and the raging animal, which, advancing in full\ncareer, its brutal fury enhanced by the rapidity of the pursuit, was now\nwithin a few yards of them. The Lord Keeper had no weapons; his age\nand gravity dispensed even with the usual appendage of a walking\nsword--could such appendage have availed him anything.\n\nIt seemed inevitable that the father or daughter, or both, should\nhave fallen victims to the impending danger, when a shot from the\nneighbouring thicket arrested the progress of the animal. He was so\ntruly struck between the junction of the spine with the skull, that the\nwound, which in any other part of his body might scarce have impeded his\ncareer, proved instantly fatal. Stumbling forward with a hideous bellow,\nthe progressive force of his previous motion, rather than any operation\nof his limbs, carried him up to within three yards of the astonished\nLord Keeper, where he rolled on the ground, his limbs darkened with the\nblack death-sweat, and quivering with the last convulsions of muscular\nmotion.\n\nLucy lay senseless on the ground, insensible of the wonderful\ndeliverance which she had experience. Her father was almost equally\nstupified, so rapid and unexpected had been the transition from the\nhorrid death which seemed inevitable to perfect security. He gazed on\nthe animal, terrible even in death, with a species of mute and confused\nastonishment, which did not permit him distinctly to understand what had\ntaken place; and so inaccurate was his consciousness of what had passed,\nthat he might have supposed the bull had been arrested in its career by\na thunderbolt, had he not observed among the branches of the thicket the\nfigure of a man, with a short gun or musquetoon in his hand.\n\nThis instantly recalled him to a sense of their situation: a glance at\nhis daughter reminded him of the necessity of procuring her assistance.\nHe called to the man, whom he concluded to be one of his foresters, to\ngive immediate attention to Miss Ashton, while he himself hastened to\ncall assistance. The huntsman approached them accordingly, and the Lord\nKeeper saw he was a stranger, but was too much agitated to make any\nfarther remarks. In a few hurried words he directed the shooter, as\nstronger and more active than himself, to carry the young lady to a\nneighbouring fountain, while he went back to Alice's hut to procure more\naid.\n\nThe man to whose timely interference they had been so much indebted did\nnot seem inclined to leave his good work half finished. He raised Lucy\nfrom the ground in his arms, and conveying her through the glades of\nthe forest by paths with which he seemed well acquainted, stopped not\nuntil he laid her in safety by the side of a plentiful and pellucid\nfountain, which had been once covered in, screened and decorated with\narchitectural ornaments of a Gothic character. But now the vault which\nhad covered it being broken down and riven, and the Gothic font ruined\nand demolished, the stream burst forth from the recess of the earth in\nopen day, and winded its way among the broken sculpture and moss-grown\nstones which lay in confusion around its source.\n\nTradition, always busy, at least in Scotland, to grace with a legendary\ntale a spot in itself interesting, had ascribed a cause of peculiar\nveneration to this fountain. A beautiful young lady met one of the Lords\nof Ravenswood while hunting near this spot, and, like a second Egeria,\nhad captivated the affections of the feudal Numa. They met frequently\nafterwards, and always at sunset, the charms of the nymph's mind\ncompleting the conquest which her beauty had begun, and the mystery of\nthe intrigue adding zest to both. She always appeared and disappeared\nclose by the fountain, with which, therefore, her lover judged she had\nsome inexplicable connexion. She placed certain restrictions on their\nintercourse, which also savoured of mystery. They met only once a\nweek--Friday was the appointed day--and she explained to the Lord of\nRavenswood that they were under the necessity of separating so soon as\nthe bell of a chapel, belonging to a hermitage in the adjoining wood,\nnow long ruinous, should toll the hour of vespers. In the course of his\nconfession, the Baron of Ravenswood entrusted the hermit with the\nsecret of this singular amour, and Father Zachary drew the necessary and\nobvious consequence that his patron was enveloped in the toils of Satan,\nand in danger of destruction, both to body and soul. He urged these\nperils to the Baron with all the force of monkish rhetoric, and\ndescribed, in the most frightful colours, the real character and person\nof the apparently lovely Naiad, whom he hesitated not to denounce as\na limb of the kingdom of darkness. The lover listened with obstinate\nincredulity; and it was not until worn out by the obstinacy of the\nanchoret that he consented to put the state and condition of his\nmistress to a certain trial, and for that purpose acquiesced in\nZachary's proposal that on their next interview the vespers bell\nshould be rung half an hour later than usual. The hermit maintained\nand bucklered his opinion, by quotations from Malleus Malificarum,\nSprengerus, Remigius, and other learned demonologists, that the Evil\nOne, thus seduced to remain behind the appointed hour, would assume her\ntrue shape, and, having appeared to her terrified lover as a fiend of\nhell, would vanish from him in a flash of sulphurous lightning. Raymond\nof Ravenswood acquiesced in the experiment, not incurious concerning\nthe issue, though confident it would disappoint the expectations of the\nhermit.\n\nAt the appointed hour the lovers met, and their interview was protracted\nbeyond that at which they usually parted, by the delay of the priest\nto ring his usual curfew. No change took place upon the nymph's outward\nform; but as soon as the lengthening shadows made her aware that the\nusual hour of the vespers chime was passed, she tore herself from her\nlover's arms with a shriek of despair, bid him adieu for ever, and,\nplunging into the fountain, disappeared from his eyes. The bubbles\noccasioned by her descent were crimsoned with blood as they arose,\nleading the distracted Baron to infer that his ill-judged curiosity\nhad occasioned the death of this interesting and mysterious being. The\nremorse which he felt, as well as the recollection of her charms, proved\nthe penance of his future life, which he lost in the battle of Flodden\nnot many months after. But, in memory of his Naiad, he had previously\nornamented the fountain in which she appeared to reside, and secured its\nwaters from profanation or pollution by the small vaulted building of\nwhich the fragments still remained scattered around it. From this period\nthe house of Ravenswood was supposed to have dated its decay.\n\nSuch was the generally-received legend, which some, who would seem\nwiser than the vulgar, explained as obscurely intimating the fate of a\nbeautiful maid of plebeian rank, the mistress of this Raymond, whom he\nslew in a fit of jealousy, and whose blood was mingled with the waters\nof the locked fountain, as it was commonly called. Others imagined\nthat the tale had a more remote origin in the ancient heathen mythology.\nAll, however, agreed that the spot was fatal to the Ravenswood family;\nand that to drink of the waters of the well, or even approach its brink,\nwas as ominous to a descendant of that house as for a Grahame to wear\ngreen, a Bruce to kill a spider, or a St. Clair to cross the Ord on a\nMonday.\n\nIt was on this ominous spot that Lucy Ashton first drew breath after her\nlong and almost deadly swoon. Beautiful and pale as the fabulous Naiad\nin the last agony of separation from her lover, she was seated so as to\nrest with her back against a part of the ruined wall, while her mantle,\ndripping with the water which her protector had used profusely to recall\nher senses, clung to her slender and beautifully proportioned form.\n\nThe first moment of recollection brought to her mind the danger which\nhad overpowered her senses; the next called to remembrance that of her\nfather. She looked around; he was nowhere to be seen. “My father, my\nfather!” was all that she could ejaculate.\n\n“Sir William is safe,” answered the voice of a stranger--“perfectly\nsafe, adn will be with you instantly.”\n\n“Are you sure of that?” exclaimed Lucy. “The bull was close by us. Do\nnot stop me: I must go to seek my father!”\n\nAnd she rose with that purpose; but her strength was so much exhausted\nthat, far from possessing the power to execute her purpose, she must\nhave fallen against the stone on which she had leant, probably not\nwithout sustaining serious injury.\n\nThe stranger was so near to her that, without actually suffering her to\nfall, he could not avoid catching her in his arms, which, however, he\ndid with a momentary reluctance, very unusual when youth interposes to\nprevent beauty from danger. It seemed as if her weight, slight as it\nwas, proved too heavy for her young and athletic assistant, for, without\nfeeling the temptation of detaining her in his arms even for a single\ninstant, he again placed her on the stone from which she had risen,\nand retreating a few steps, repeated hastily “Sir William Ashton is\nperfectly safe and will be here instantly. Do not make yourself anxious\non his account: Fate has singularly preserved him. You, madam, are\nexhausted, and must not think of rising until you have some assistance\nmore suitable than mine.”\n\nLucy, whose senses were by this time more effectually collected, was\nnaturally led to look at the stranger with attention. There was nothing\nin his appearance which should have rendered him unwilling to offer his\narm to a young lady who required support, or which could have induced\nher to refuse his assistance; and she could not help thinking, even\nin that moment, that he seemed cold and reluctant to offer it. A\nshooting-dress of dark cloth intimated the rank of the wearer, though\nconcealed in part by a large and loose cloak of a dark brown colour.\nA montero cap and a black feather drooped over the wearer's brow,\nand partly concealed his features, which, so far as seen, were dark,\nregular, adn full of majestic, though somewhat sullen, expression.\nSome secret sorrow, or the brooding spirit of some moody passion, had\nquenched the light and ingenuous vivacity of youth in a countenance\nsingularly fitted to display both, and it was not easy to gaze on the\nstranger without a secret impression either of pity or awe, or at least\nof doubt and curiosity allied to both.\n\nThe impression which we have necessarily been long in describing, Lucy\nfelt in the glance of a moment, and had no sooner encountered the keen\nblack eyes of the stranger than her own were bent on the ground with a\nmixture of bashful embarrassment and fear. Yet there was a necessity to\nspeak, or at last she thought so, and in a fluttered accent she began\nto mention her wonderful escape, in which she was sure that the stranger\nmust, under Heaven, have been her father's protector and her own.\n\nHe seemed to shrink from her expressions of gratitude, while he replied\nabruptly, “I leave you, madam,” the deep melody of his voice rendered\npowerful, but not harsh, by something like a severity of tone--“I leave\nyou to the protection of those to whom it is possible you may have this\nday been a guardian angel.”\n\nLucy was surprised at the ambiguity of his language, and, with a feeling\nof artless and unaffected gratitude, began to deprecate the idea of\nhaving intended to give her deliverer any offence, as if such a thing\nhad been possible. “I have been unfortunate,” she said, “in endeavouring\nto express my thanks--I am sure it must be so, though I cannot recollect\nwhat I said; but would you but stay till my father--till the Lord Keeper\ncomes; would you only permit him to pay you his thanks, and to inquire\nyour name?”\n\n“My name is unnecessary,” answered the stranger; “your father--I would\nrather say Sir William Ashton--will learn it soon enough, for all the\npleasure it is likely to afford him.”\n\n“You mistake him,” said Lucy, earnestly; “he will be grateful for my\nsake and for his own. You do not know my father, or you are deceiving me\nwith a story of his safety, when he has already fallen a victim to the\nfury of that animal.”\n\nWhen she had caught this idea, she started from the ground and\nendeavoured to press towards the avenue in which the accident had taken\nplace, while the stranger, though he seemed to hesitate between the\ndesire to assist and the wish to leave her, was obliged, in common\nhumanity, to oppose her both by entreaty and action.\n\n“On the word of a gentleman, madam, I tell you the truth; your father\nis in perfect safety; you will expose yourself to injury if you venture\nback where the herd of wild cattle grazed. If you will go”--for, having\nonce adopted the idea that her father was still in danger, she pressed\nforward in spite of him--“if you WILL go, accept my arm, though I am not\nperhaps the person who can with most propriety offer you support.”\n\nBut, without heeding this intimation, Lucy took him at his word. “Oh,\nif you be a man,” she said--“if you be a gentleman, assist me to find my\nfather! You shall not leave me--you must go with me; he is dying perhaps\nwhile we are talking here!”\n\nThen, without listening to excuse or apology, and holding fast by the\nstranger's arm, though unconscious of anything save the support which\nit gave, and without which she could not have moved, mixed with a vague\nfeeling of preventing his escape from her, she was urging, and almost\ndragging, him forward when Sir William Ashton came up, followed by the\nfemale attendant of blind Alice, and by two woodcutters, whom he had\nsummoned from their occupation to his assistance. His joy at seeing his\ndaughter safe overcame the surprise with which he would at another time\nhave beheld her hanging as familiarly on the arm of a stranger as she\nmight have done upon his own.\n\n“Lucy, my dear Lucy, are you safe?--are you well?” were the only words\nthat broke from him as he embraced her in ecstasy.\n\n“I am well, sir, thank God! and still more that I see you so; but this\ngentleman,” she said, quitting his arm and shrinking from him, “what\nmust he think of me?” and her eloquent blood, flushing over neck and\nbrow, spoke how much she was ashamed of the freedom with which she had\ncraved, and even compelled, his assistance.\n\n“This gentleman,” said Sir William Ashton, “will, I trust, not regret\nthe trouble we have given him, when I assure him of the gratitude of\nthe Lord Keeper for the greatest service which one man ever rendered to\nanother--for the life of my child--for my own life, which he has saved\nby his bravery and presence of mind. He will, I am sure, permit us to\nrequest----” “Request nothing of ME, my lord,” said the stranger, in a\nstern and peremptory tone; “I am the Master of Ravenswood.”\n\nThere was a dead pause of surprise, not unmixed with less pleasant\nfeelings. The Master wrapt himself in his cloak, made a haughty\ninclination toward Lucy, muttering a few words of courtesy, as\nindistinctly heard as they seemed to be reluctantly uttered, and,\nturning from them, was immediately lost in the thicket.\n\n“The Master of Ravenswood!” said the Lord Keeper, when he had recovered\nhis momentary astonishment. “Hasten after him--stop him--beg him to\nspeak to me for a single moment.”\n\nThe two foresters accordingly set off in pursuit of the stranger. They\nspeedily reappeared, and, in an embarrassed and awkward manner, said the\ngentleman would not return.\n\nThe Lord Keeper took one of the fellows aside, and questioned him more\nclosely what the Master of Ravenswood had said.\n\n“He just said he wadna come back,” said the man, with the caution of\na prudent Scotchman, who cared not to be the bearer of an unpleasant\nerrand.\n\n“He said something more, sir,” said the Lord Keeper, “and I insist on\nknowing what it was.”\n\n“Why, then, my lord,” said the man, looking down, “he said--But it wad\nbe nae pleasure to your lordship to hear it, for I dare say the Master\nmeant nae ill.”\n\n“That's none of your concern, sir; I desire to hear the very words.”\n\n“Weel, then,” replied the man, “he said, 'Tell Sir William Ashton that\nthe next time he and I forgather, he will nto be half sae blythe of our\nmeeting as of our parting.'”\n\n“Very well, sir,” said the Lord Keeper, “I believe he alludes to a wager\nwe have on our hawks; it is a matter of no consequence.”\n\nHe turned to his daughter, who was by this time so much recovered as to\nbe able to walk home. But the effect, which the various recollections\nconnected with a scene so terrific made upon a mind which was\nsusceptible in an extreme degree, was more permanent than the injury\nwhich her nerves had sustained. Visions of terror, both in sleep and in\nwaking reveries, recalled to her the form of the furious animal, and the\ndreadful bellow with which he accompanied his career; and it was always\nthe image of the Master of Ravenswood, with his native nobleness of\ncountenance and form, that seemed to interpose betwixt her and assured\ndeath. It is, perhaps, at all times dangerous for a young person to\nsuffer recollection to dwell repeatedly, and with too much complacency,\non the same individual; but in Lucy's situation it was almost\nunavoidable. She had never happened to see a young man of mien and\nfeatures so romantic and so striking as young Ravenswood; but had she\nseen an hundred his equals or his superiors in those particulars, no one\nelse would have been linked to her heart by the strong associations of\nremembered danger and escape, of gratitude, wonder, and curiosity. I\nsay curiosity, for it is likely that the singularly restrained and\nunaccommodating manners of the Master of Ravenswood, so much at variance\nwith the natural expression of his features and grace of his deportment,\nas they excited wonder by the contrast, had their effect in riveting her\nattention to the recollections. She knew little of Ravenswood, or the\ndisputes which had existed betwixt her father and his, and perhaps could\nin her gentleness of mind hardly have comprehended the angry and bitter\npassions which they had engendered. But she knew that he was come of\nnoble stem; was poor, though descended from the noble and the wealthy;\nand she felt that she could sympathise with the feelings of a proud\nmind, which urged him to recoil from the proffered gratitude of the new\nproprietors of his father's house and domains. Would he have equally\nshunned their acknowledgments and avoided their intimacy, had her\nfather's request been urged more mildly, less abruptly, and softened\nwith the grace which women so well know how to throw into their manner,\nwhen they mean to mediate betwixt the headlong passions of the ruder\nsex? This was a perilous question to ask her own mind--perilous both in\nthe idea and its consequences.\n\nLucy Ashton, in short, was involved in those mazes of the imagination\nwhich are most dangerous to the young and the sensitive. Time, it\nis true, absence, change of scene and new faces, might probably have\ndestroyed the illusion in her instance, as it has done in many others;\nbut her residence remained solitary, and her mind without those means of\ndissipating her pleasing visions. This solitude was chiefly owing to the\nabsence of Lady Ashton, who was at this time in Edinburgh, watching the\nprogress of some state-intrigue; the Lord Keeper only received society\nout of policy or ostentation, and was by nature rather reserved and\nunsociable; and thus no cavalier appeared to rival or to obscure the\nideal picture of chivalrous excellence which Lucy had pictured to\nherself in the Master of Ravenswood.\n\nWhile Lucy indulged in these dreams, she made frequent visits to old\nblind Alice, hoping it would be easy to lead her to talk on the subject\nwhich at present she had so imprudently admitted to occupy so large a\nportion of her thoughts. But Alice did not in this particular gratify\nher wishes and expectations. She spoke readily, and with pathetic\nfeeling, concerning the family in general, but seemed to observe\nan especial and cautious silence on the subject of the present\nrepresentative. The little she said of him was not altogether so\nfavourable as Lucy had anticipated. She hinted that he was of a stern\nand unforgiving character, more ready to resent than to pardon injuries;\nand Lucy combined, with great alarm, the hints which she now dropped\nof these dangerous qualities with Alice's advice to her father, so\nemphatically given, “to beware of Ravenswood.”\n\nBut that very Ravenswood, of whom such unjust suspicions had been\nentertained, had, almost immediately after they had been uttered,\nconfuted them by saving at once her father's life and her own. Had he\nnourished such black revenge as Alice's dark hints seemed to indicate,\nno deed of active guilt was necessary to the full gratification of\nthat evil passion. He needed but to have withheld for an instant his\nindispensable and effective assistance, and the object of his resentment\nmust have perished, without any direct aggression on his part, by a\ndeath equally fearful and certain. She conceived, therefore, that some\nsecret prejudice, or the suspicions incident to age and misfortune,\nhad led Alice to form conclusions injurious to the character, and\nirreconcilable both with the generous conduct and noble features, of the\nMaster of Ravenswood. And in this belief Lucy reposed her hope, and went\non weaving her enchanted web of fairy tissue, as beautiful and transient\nas the film of the gossamer when it is pearled with the morning dew and\nglimmering to the sun.\n\nHer father, in the mean while, as well as the Master of Ravenswood, were\nmaking reflections, as frequent though more solid than those of Lucy,\nupon the singular event which had taken place. The Lord Keeper's first\ntask, when he returned home, was to ascertain by medical advice that\nhis daughter had sustained no injury from the dangerous and alarming\nsituation in which she had been placed. Satisfied on this topic, he\nproceeded to revise the memoranda which he had taken down from the mouth\nof the person employed to interrupt the funeral service of the late\nLord Ravenswood. Bred to casuistry, and well accustomed to practise the\nambidexter ingenuity of the bar, it cost him little trouble to soften\nthe features of the tumult which he had been at first so anxious to\nexaggerate. He preached to his colleagues of the privy council the\nnecessity of using conciliatory measures with young men, whose blood\nand temper were hot, and their experience of life limited. He did not\nhesitate to attribute some censure to the conduct of the officer, as\nhaving been unnecessarily irritating.\n\nThese were the contents of his public despatches. The letters which\nhe wrote to those private friends into whose management the matter was\nlikely to fall were of a yet more favourable tenor. He represented\nthat lenity in this case would be equally politic and popular, whereas,\nconsidering the high respect with which the rites of interment are\nregarded in Scotland, any severity exercised against the Master of\nRavenswood for protecting those of his father from interruption, would\nbe on all sides most unfavourably construed. And, finally, assuming the\nlanguage of a generous and high-spirited man, he made it his particular\nrequest that this affair should be passed over without severe notice. He\nalluded with delicacy to the predicament in which he himself stood with\nyoung Ravenswood, as having succeeded in the long train of litigation\nby which the fortunes of that noble house had been so much reduced, and\nconfessed it would be most peculiarly acceptable to his own feelings,\ncould he find in some sort to counterbalance the disadvantages which he\nhad occasioned the family, though only in the prosecution of his just\nand lawful rights. He therefore made it his particular and personal\nrequest that the matter should have no farther consequences, an\ninsinuated a desire that he himself should have the merit of having\nput a stop to it by his favourable report and intercession. It was\nparticularly remarkable that, contrary to his uniform practice, he made\nno special communication to Lady Ashton upon the subject of the tumult;\nand although he mentioned the alarm which Lucy had received from one\nof the wild cattle, yet he gave no detailed account of an incident so\ninteresting and terrible.\n\nThere was much surprise among Sir William Ashton's political friends and\ncolleagues on receiving letters of a tenor so unexpected. On comparing\nnotes together, one smiled, one put up his eyebrows, a third nodded\nacquiescence in the general wonder, and a fourth asked if they were sure\nthese were ALL the letters the Lord Keeper had written on the subject.\n“It runs strangely in my mind, my lords, that none of these advices\ncontain the root of the matter.”\n\nBut no secret letters of a contrary nature had been received, although\nthe question seemed to imply the possibility of their existence.\n\n“Well,” said an old grey-headed statesman, who had contrived, by\nshifting and trimming, to maintain his post at the steerage through all\nthe changes of course which the vessel had held for thirty years, “I\nthought Sir William would hae verified the auld Scottish saying, 'As\nsoon comes the lamb's skin to market as the auld tup's'.”\n\n“We must please him after his own fashion,” said another, “though it be\nan unlooked-for one.”\n\n“A wilful man maun hae his way,” answered the old counsellor.\n\n“The Keeper will rue this before year and day are out,” said a third;\n“the Master of Ravenswood is the lad to wind him a pirn.”\n\n“Why, what would you do, my lords, with the poor young fellow?” said a\nnoble Marquis present. “The Lord Keeper has got all his estates; he has\nnot a cross to bless himself with.”\n\nOn which the ancient Lord Turntippet replied,\n\n     “If he hasna gear to fine,\n     He ha shins to pine.\n\n“And that was our way before the Revolution: Lucitur cum persona, qui\nluere non potest cum crumena. Hegh, my lords, that's gude law Latin.”\n\n“I can see no motive,” replied the Marquis, “that any noble lord can\nhave for urging this matter farther; let the Lord Keeper have the power\nto deal in it as he pleases.”\n\n“Agree, agree--remit to the Lord Keeper, with any other person for\nfashion's sake--Lord Hirplehooly, who is bed-ridden--one to be a quorum.\nMake your entry in the minutes, Mr. Clerk. And now, my lords, there is\nthat young scattergood the Laird of Bucklaw's fine to be disposed upon.\nI suppose it goes to my Lord Treasurer?”\n\n“Shame be in my meal-poke, then,” exclaimed the Lord Turntippet, “and\nyour hand aye in the nook of it! I had set that down for a bye-bit\nbetween meals for mysell.”\n\n“To use one of your favourite saws, my lord,” replied the Marquis, “you\nare like the miller's dog, that licks his lips before the bag is untied:\nthe man is not fined yet.”\n\n“But that costs but twa skarts of a pen,” said Lord Turntippet; “and\nsurely there is nae noble lord that will presume to say that I, wha hae\ncomplied wi' a' compliances, taen all manner of tests, adjured all that\nwas to be abjured, and sworn a' that was to be sworn, for these thirty\nyears bye-past, sticking fast by my duty to the state through good\nreport and bad report, shouldna hae something now and then to synd my\nmouth wi' after sic drouthy wark? Eh?”\n\n“It would be very unreasonable indeed, my lord,” replied the Marquis,\n“had we either thought that your lordship's drought was quenchable, or\nobserved anything stick in your throat that required washing down.”\n\nAnd so we close the scene on the privy council of that period.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n     For this are all these warriors come,\n     To hear an idle tale;\n     And o'er our death-accustom'd arms\n     Shall silly tears prevail?\n\n     HENRY MACKENZIE.\n\nON the evening of the day when the Lord Keeper and his daughter were\nsaved from such imminent peril, two strangers were seated in the most\nprivate apartment of a small obscure inn, or rather alehouse, called\nthe Tod's Den [Hole], about three or four [five or six] miles from the\nCastle of Ravenswood and as far from the ruinous tower of Wolf's Crag,\nbetwixt which two places it was situated.\n\nOne of these strangers was about forty years of age, tall, and thin in\nthe flanks, with an aquiline nose, dark penetrating eyes, and a shrewd\nbut sinister cast of countenance. The other was about fifteen years\nyounger, short, stout, ruddy-faced, and red-haired, with an open,\nresolute, and cheerful eye, to which careless and fearless freedom and\ninward daring gave fire and expression, notwithstanding its light grey\ncolour. A stoup of wine (for in those days it was served out from the\ncask in pewter flagons) was placed on the table, and each had his quaigh\nor bicker before him. But there was little appearance of conviviality.\nWith folded arms, and looks of anxious expectation, they eyed each other\nin silence, each wrapt in his own thoughts, and holding no communication\nwith his neighbour. At length the younger broke silence by exclaiming:\n“What the foul fiend can detain the Master so long? He must have\nmiscarried in his enterprise. Why did you dissuade me from going with\nhim?”\n\n“One man is enough to right his own wrong,” said the taller and older\npersonage; “we venture our lives for him in coming thus far on such an\nerrand.”\n\n“You are but a craven after all, Craigengelt,” answered the younger,\n“and that's what many folk have thought you before now.” “But what none\nhas dared to tell me,” said Craigengelt, laying his hand on the hilt of\nhis sword; “and, but that I hold a hasty man no better than a fool, I\nwould----” he paused for his companion's answer.\n\n“WOULD you?” said the other, coolly; “and why do you not then?”\n\nCraigengelt drew his cutlass an inch or two, and then returned it with\nviolence into the scabbard--“Because there is a deeper stake to be\nplayed for than the lives of twenty hare-brained gowks like you.”\n\n“You are right there,” said his companion, “for it if were not that\nthese forfeitures, and that last fine that the old driveller Turntippet\nis gaping for, and which, I dare say, is laid on by this time, have\nfairly driven me out of house and home, I were a coxcomb and a cuckoo to\nboot to trust your fair promises of getting me a commission in the\nIrish brigade. What have I to do with the Irish brigade? I am a\nplain Scotchman, as my father was before me; and my grand-aunt, Lady\nGirnington, cannot live for ever.”\n\n“Ay, Bucklaw,” observed Craigengelt, “but she may live for many a long\nday; and for your father, he had land and living, kept himself close\nfrom wadsetters and money-lenders, paid each man his due, and lived on\nhis own.”\n\n“And whose fault is it that I have not done so too?” said\nBucklaw--“whose but the devil's and yours, and such-like as you, that\nhave led me to the far end of a fair estate? And now I shall be obliged,\nI suppose, to shelter and shift about like yourself: live one week upon\na line of secret intelligence from Saint Germains; another upon a report\nof a rising in the Highlands; get my breakfast and morning draught of\nsack from old Jacobite ladies, and give them locks of my old wig for the\nChevalier's hair; second my friend in his quarrel till he comes to the\nfield, and then flinch from him lest so important a political agent\nshould perish from the way. All this I must do for bread, besides\ncalling myself a captain!”\n\n“You think you are making a fine speech now,” said Craigengelt, “and\nshowing much wit at my expense. Is starving or hanging better than the\nlife I am obliged to lead, because the present fortunes of the king\ncannot sufficiently support his envoys?” “Starving is honester,\nCraigengelt, and hanging is like to be the end on't. But what you mean\nto make of this poor fellow Ravenswood, I know not. He has no money\nleft, any more than I; his lands are all pawned and pledged, and the\ninterest eats up the rents, and is not satisfied, and what do you hope\nto make by meddling in his affairs?”\n\n“Content yourself, Bucklaw; I know my business,” replied Craigengelt.\n“Besides that his name, and his father's services in 1689, will make\nsuch an acquisition sound well both at Versailles and Saint Germains,\nyou will also please be informed that the Master of Ravenswood is a very\ndifferent kind of a young fellow from you. He has parts and address,\nas well as courage and talents, and will present himself abroad like a\nyoung man of head as well as heart, who knows something more than the\nspeed of a horse or the flight of a hawk. I have lost credit of late, by\nbringing over no one that had sense to know more than how to unharbour a\nstag, or take and reclaim an eyas. The Master has education, sense, and\npenetration.”\n\n“And yet is not wise enough to escape the tricks of a kidnapper,\nCraigengelt?” replied the younger man. “But don't be angry; you know\nyou will nto fight, and so it is as well to leave your hilt in peace\nand quiet, and tell me in sober guise how you drew the Master into your\nconfidence?”\n\n“By flattering his love of vengeance, Bucklaw,” answered Craigengelt.\n“He has always distrusted me; but I watched my time, and struck while\nhis temper was red-hot with the sense of insult and of wrong. He goes\nnow to expostulate, as he says, and perhaps thinks, with Sir William\nAshton. I say, that if they meet, and the lawyer puts him to his\ndefence, the Master will kill him; for he had that sparkle in his eye\nwhich never deceives you when you would read a man's purpose. At any\nrate, he will give him such a bullying as will be construed into an\nassault on a privy councillor; so there will be a total breach betwixt\nhim and government. Scotland will be too hot for him; France will gain\nhim; and we will all set sail together in the French brig 'L'Espoir,'\nwhich is hovering for us off Eyemouth.”\n\n“Content am I,” said Bucklaw; “Scotland has little left that I care\nabout; and if carrying the Master with us will get us a better reception\nin France, why, so be it, a God's name. I doubt our own merits will\nprocure us slender preferment; and I trust he will send a ball through\nthe Keeper's head before he joins us. One or two of these scoundrel\nstatesmen should be shot once a year, just to keep the others on their\ngood behaviour.”\n\n“That is very true,” replied Craigengelt; “and it reminds me that I\nmust go and see that our horses have been fed and are in readiness; for,\nshould such deed be done, it will be no time for grass to grow beneath\ntheir heels.” He proceeded as far as the door, then turned back with a\nlook of earnestness, and said to Bucklaw: “Whatever should come of this\nbusiness, I am sure you will do me the justice to remember that I said\nnothing to the Master which could imply my accession to any act of\nviolence which he may take it into his head to commit.”\n\n“No, no, not a single word like accession,” replied Bucklaw; “you\nknow too well the risk belonging to these two terrible words, 'art and\npart.'” Then, as if to himself, he recited the following lines:\n\n“The dial spoke not, but it made shrewd signs, And pointed full upon the\nstroke of murder.\n\n“What is that you are talking to yourself?” said Craigengelt, turning\nback with some anxiety.\n\n“Nothing, only two lines I have heard upon the stage,” replied his\ncompanion.\n\n“Bucklaw,” said Craigengelt, “I sometimes think you should have been a\nstage-player yourself; all is fancy and frolic with you.”\n\n“I have often thought so myself,” said Bucklaw. “I believe it would be\nsafer than acting with you in the Fatal Conspiracy. But away, play\nyour own part, and look after the horses like a groom as you are. A\nplay-actor--a stage-player!” he repeated to himself; “that would have\ndeserved a stab, but that Craigengelt's a coward. And yet I should like\nthe profession well enough. Stay, let me see; ay, I would come out in\nAlexander:\n\n     Thus from the grave I rise to save my love,\n     Draw all your swords, and quick as lightning move.\n     When I rush on, sure none will dare to stay:\n     'Tis love commands, and glory leads the way.”\n\nAs with a voice of thunder, and his hand upon his sword, Bucklaw\nrepeated the ranting couplets of poor Lee, Craigengelt re-entered with a\nface of alarm.\n\n“We are undone, Bucklaw! The Master's led horse has cast himself over\nhis halter in the stable, and is dead lame. His hackney will be set up\nwith the day's work, and now he has no fresh horse; he will never get\noff.”\n\n“Egad, there will be no moving with the speed of lightning this bout,”\n said Bucklaw, drily. “But stay, you can give him yours.”\n\n“What! and be taken myself? I thank you for the proposal,” said\nCraigengelt.\n\n“Why,” replied Bucklaw, “if the Lord Keeper should have met with a\nmischance, which for my part I cannot suppose, for the Master is not\nthe lad to shoot an old and unarmed man--but IF there should have been\na fray at the Castle, you are neither art not part in it, you know, so\nhave nothing to fear.”\n\n“True, true,” answered the other, with embarrassment; “but consider my\ncommission from Saint Germains.”\n\n“Which many men think is a commission of your own making, noble Captain.\nWell, if you will not give him your horse, why, d----n it, he must have\nmine.”\n\n“Yours?” said Craigengelt.\n\n“Ay, mine,” repeated Bucklaw; “it shall never be said that I agreed to\nback a gentleman in a little affair of honour, and neither helped him on\nwith it nor off from it.”\n\n“You will give him your horse? and have you considered the loss?”\n\n“Loss! why, Grey Gilbert cost me twenty Jacobuses, that's true; but then\nhis hackney is worth something, and his Black Moor is worth twice as\nmuch were he sound, and I know how to handle him. Take a fat sucking\nmastiff whelp, flay and bowel him, stuff the body full of black and\ngrey snails, roast a reasonable time, and baste with oil of spikenard,\nsaffron, cinnamon, and honey, anoint with the dripping, working it\nin----”\n\n“Yes, Bucklaw; but in the mean while, before the sprain is cured, nay,\nbefore the whelp is roasted, you will be caught and hung. Depend on it,\nthe chase will be hard after Ravenswood. I wish we had made our place of\nrendezvous nearer to the coast.”\n\n“On my faith, then,” said Bucklaw, “I had best go off just now, and\nleave my horse for him. Stay--stay, he comes: I hear a horse's feet.”\n\n“Are you sure there is only one?” said Craigengelt. “I fear there is a\nchase; I think I hear three or four galloping together. I am sure I hear\nmore horses than one.”\n\n“Pooh, pooh, it is the wench of the house clattering to the well in her\npattens. By my faith, Captain, you should give up both your captainship\nand your secret service, for you are as easily scared as a wild goose.\nBut here comes the Master alone, and looking as gloomy as a night in\nNovember.”\n\nThe Master of Ravenswood entered the room accordingly, his cloak muffled\naround him, his arms folded, his looks stern, and at the same time\ndejected. He flung his cloak from him as he entered, threw himself upon\na chair, and appeared sunk in a profound reverie.\n\n“What has happened? What have you done?” was hastily demanded by\nCraigengelt and Bucklaw in the same moment.\n\n“Nothing!” was the short and sullen answer.\n\n“Nothing! and left us, determined to call the old villain to account\nfor all the injuries that you, we, and the country have received at his\nhand? Have you seen him?” “I have,” replied the Master of Ravenswood.\n\n“Seen him--and come away without settling scores which have been so long\ndue?” said Bucklaw; “I would not have expected that at the hand of the\nMaster of Ravenswood.”\n\n“No matter what you expected,” replied Ravenswood; “it is not to you,\nsir, that I shall be disposed to render any reason for my conduct.”\n\n“Patience, Bucklaw,” said Craigengelt, interrupting his companion, who\nseemed about to make an angry reply. “The Master has been interrupted in\nhis purpose by some accident; but he must excuse the anxious curiosity\nof friends who are devoted to his cause like you and me.”\n\n“Friends, Captain Craigengelt!” retorted Ravenswood, haughtily; “I am\nignorant what familiarity passed betwixt us to entitle you to use that\nexpression. I think our friendship amounts to this, that we agreed to\nleave Scotland together so soon as I should have visited the\nalienated mansion of my fathers, and had an interview with its present\npossessor--I will not call him proprietor.”\n\n“Very true, Master,” answered Bucklaw; “and as we thought you had in\nmind to do something to put your neck in jeopardy, Craigie and I very\ncourteously agreed to tarry for you, although ours might run some risk\nin consequence. As to Craigie, indeed, it does not very much signify: he\nhad gallows written on his brow in the hour of his birth; but I should\nnot like to discredit my parentage by coming to such an end in another\nman's cause.”\n\n“Gentlemen,” said the Master of Ravenswood, “I am sorry if I have\noccasioned you any inconvenience, but I must claim the right of judging\nwhat is best for my own affairs, without rendering explanations to any\none. I have altered my mind, and do not design to leave the country this\nseason.”\n\n“Not to leave the country, Master!” exclaimed Craigengelt. “Not to go\nover, after all the trouble and expense I have incurred--after all the\nrisk of discovery, and the expense of freight and demurrage!”\n\n“Sir,” replied the Master of Ravenswood, “when I designed to leave this\ncountry in this haste, I made use of your obliging offer to procure me\nmeans of conveyance; but I do not recollect that I pledged myself to\ngo off, if I found occasion to alter my mind. For your trouble on my\naccount, I am sorry, and I thank you; your expense,” he added, putting\nhis hand into his pocket, “admits a more solid compensation: freight and\ndemurrage are matters with which I am unacquainted, Captain Craigengelt,\nbut take my purse and pay yourself according to your own conscience.”\n And accordingly he tendered a purse with some gold in it to the\nsoi-disant captain.\n\nBut here Bucklaw interposed in his turn. “Your fingers, Craigie, seem to\nitch for that same piece of green network,” said he; “but I make my vow\nto God, that if they offer to close upon it, I will chop them off with\nmy whinger. Since the Master has changed his mind, I suppose we need\nstay here no longer; but in the first place I beg leave to tell him----”\n\n“Tell him anything you will,” said Craigengelt, “if you will first\nallow me to state the inconveniences to which he will expose himself by\nquitting our society, to remind him of the obstacles to his remaining\nhere, and of the difficulties attending his proper introduction at\nVersailles and Saint Germains without the countenance of those who have\nestablished useful connexions.”\n\n“Besides forfeiting the friendship,” said Bucklaw, “of at least one man\nof spirit and honour.”\n\n“Gentlemen,” said Ravenswood, “permit me once more to assure you\nthat you have been pleased to attach to our temporary connexion more\nimportance than I ever meant that it should have. When I repair to\nforeign courts, I shall not need the introduction of an intriguing\nadventurer, nor is it necessary for me to set value on the friendship\nof a hot-headed bully.” With these words, and without waiting for an\nanswer, he left the apartment, remounted his horse, and was heard to\nride off.\n\n“Mortbleu!” said Captain Craigengelt, “my recruit is lost!”\n\n“Ay, Captain,” said Bucklaw, “the salmon is off with hook and all. But\nI will after him, for I have had more of his insolence than I can well\ndigest.”\n\nCraigengelt offered to accompany him; but Bucklaw replied: “No, no,\nCaptain, keep you the check of the chimney-nook till I come back; it's\ngood sleeping in a haill skin.\n\n     Little kens the auld wife that sits by the fire,\n     How cauld the wind blaws in hurle-burle swire.”\n\nAnd singing as he went, he left the apartment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n     Now, Billy Berwick, keep good heart,\n     And of they talking let me be;\n     But if thou art a man, as I am sure thou art,\n     Come over the dike and fight with me.\n\n     Old Ballad.\n\nTHE Master of Ravenswood had mounted the ambling hackney which he before\nrode, on finding the accident which had happened to his led horse, and,\nfor the animal's ease, was proceeding at a slow pace from the Tod's Den\ntowards his old tower of Wolf's Crag, when he heard the galloping of a\nhorse behind him, and, looking back, perceived that he was pursued by\nyoung Bucklaw, who had been delayed a few minutes in the pursuit by\nthe irresistable temptation of giving the hostler at the Tod's Den some\nrecipe for treating the lame horse. This brief delay he had made up by\nhard galloping, and now overtook the Master where the road traversed\na waste moor. “Halt, sir,” cried Bucklaw; “I am no political agent--no\nCaptain Craigengelt, whose life is too important to be hazarded in\ndefence of his honour. I am Frank Hayston of Bucklaw, and no man injures\nme by word, deed, sign, or look, but he must render me an account of\nit.”\n\n“This is all very well, Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw,” replied the Master\nof Ravenswood, in a tone the most calm and indifferent; “but I have no\nquarrel with you, and desire to have none. Our roads homeward, as well\nas our roads through life, lie in different directions; there is no\noccasion for us crossing each other.”\n\n“Is there not?” said Bucklaw, impetuously. “By Heaven! but I say that\nthere is, though: you called us intriguing adventurers.”\n\n“Be correct in your recollection, Mr. Hayston; it was to your companion\nonly I applied that epithet, and you know him to be no better.”\n\n“And what then? He was my companion for the time, and no man shall\ninsult my companion, right or wrong, while he is in my company.”\n\n“Then, Mr. Hayston,” replied Ravenswood, with the same composure, “you\nshould choose your society better, or you are like to have much work\nin your capacity of their champion. Go home, sir; sleep, and have more\nreason in your wrath to-morrow.”\n\n“Not so, Master, you have mistaken your man; high airs and wise saws\nshall not carry it off thus. Besides, you termed me bully, and you shall\nretract the word before we part.”\n\n“Faith, scarcely,” said Ravenswood, “unless you show me better reason\nfor thinking myself mistaken than you are now producing.”\n\n“Then, Master,” said Bucklaw, “though I should be sorry to offer it to a\nman of your quality, if you will not justify your incivility, or retract\nit, or name a place of meeting, you must here undergo the hard word and\nthe hard blow.”\n\n“Neither will be necessary,” said Ravenswood; “I am satisfied with what\nI have done to avoid an affair with you. If you are serious, this place\nwill serve as well as another.”\n\n“Dismount then, and draw,” said Bucklaw, setting him an example. “I\nalways thought and said you were a pretty man; I should be sorry to\nreport you otherwise.”\n\n“You shall have no reason, sir,” said Ravenswood, alighting, and putting\nhimself into a posture of defence.\n\nTheir swords crossed, and the combat commenced with great spirit on the\npart of Bucklaw, who was well accustomed to affairs of the kind, and\ndistinguished by address and dexterity at his weapon. In the present\ncase, however, he did not use his skill to advantage; for, having\nlost temper at the cool and contemptuous manner in which the Master of\nRavenswood had long refused, and at length granted, him satisfaction,\nand urged by his impatience, he adopted the part of an assailant with\ninconsiderate eagerness. The Master, with equal skill, and much greater\ncomposure, remained chiefly on the defensive, and even declined to avail\nhimself of one or two advantages afforded him by the eagerness of his\nadversary. At length, in a desperate lunge, which he followed with\nan attempt to close, Bucklaw's foot slipped, and he fell on the short\ngrassy turf on which they were fighting. “Take your life, sir,” said the\nMaster of Ravenswood, “and mend it if you can.”\n\n“It would be but a cobbled piece of work, I fear,” said Bucklaw, rising\nslowly and gathering up his sword, much less disconcerted with the issue\nof the combat than could have been expected from the impetuosity of\nhis temper. “I thank you for my life, Master,” he pursued. “There is my\nhand; I bear no ill-will to you, either for my bad luck or your better\nswordsmanship.”\n\nThe Master looked steadily at him for an instant, then extended his hand\nto him. “Bucklaw,” he said, “you are a generous fellow, and I have done\nyou wrong. I heartily ask your pardon for the expression which offended\nyou; it was hastily and incautiously uttered, and I am convinced it is\ntotally misapplied.”\n\n“Are you indeed, Master?” said Bucklaw, his face resuming at once its\nnatural expression of light-hearted carelessness and audacity; “that is\nmore than I expected of you; for, Master, men say you are not ready to\nretract your opinion and your language.”\n\n“Not when I have well considered them,” said the Master.\n\n“Then you are a little wiser than I am, for I always give my friend\nsatisfaction first, and explanation afterwards. If one of us falls, all\naccounts are settled; if not, men are never so ready for peace as after\nwar. But what does that bawling brat of a boy want?” said Bucklaw. “I\nwish to Heaven he had come a few minutes sooner! and yet it must have\nbeen ended some time, and perhaps this way is as well as any other.”\n\nAs he spoke, the boy he mentioned came up, cudgelling an ass, on which\nhe was mounted, to the top of its speed, and sending, like one of\nOssian's heroes, his voice before him: “Gentlemen--gentlemen, save\nyourselves! for the gudewife bade us tell ye there were folk in her\nhouse had taen Captain Craigengelt, and were seeking for Bucklaw, and\nthat ye behoved to ride for it.” “By my faith, and that's very true, my\nman” said Bucklaw; “and there's a silver sixpence for your news, and I\nwould give any man twice as much would tell me which way I should ride.”\n\n“That will I, Bucklaw,” said Ravenswood; “ride home to Wolf's Crag with\nme. There are places in the old tower where you might lie hid, were a\nthousand men to seek you.”\n\n“But that will bring you into trouble yourself, Master; and unless you\nbe in the Jacobite scrape already, it is quite needless for me to drag\nyou in.”\n\n“Not a whit; I have nothing to fear.”\n\n“Then I will ride with you blythely, for, to say the truth, I do not\nknow the rendezvous that Craigie was to guide us to this night; and I am\nsure that, if he is taken, he will tell all the truth of me, and twenty\nlies of you, in order to save himself from the withie.”\n\nThey mounted and rode off in company accordingly, striking off the\nordinary road, and holding their way by wild moorish unfrequented paths,\nwith which the gentlemen were well acquainted from the exercise of\nthe chase, but through which others would have had much difficulty in\ntracing their course. They rode for some time in silence, making such\nhaste as the condition of Ravenswood's horse permitted, until night\nhaving gradually closed around them, they discontinued their speed, both\nfrom the difficulty of discovering their path, and from the hope that\nthey were beyond the reach of pursuit or observation.\n\n“And now that we have drawn bridle a bit,” said Bucklaw, “I would fain\nask you a question, Master.”\n\n“Ask and welcome,” said Ravenswood, “but forgive not answering it,\nunless I think proper.”\n\n“Well, it is simply this,” answered his late antagonist “What, in\nthe name of old Sathan, could make you, who stand so highly on your\nreputation, think for a moment of drawing up with such a rogue as\nCraigengelt, and such a scapegrace as folk call Bucklaw?”\n\n“Simply, because I was desperate, and sought desperate associates.”\n\n“And what made you break off from us at the nearest?” again demanded\nBucklaw.\n\n“Because I had changed my mind,” said the Master, “and renounced my\nenterprise, at least for the present. And now that I have answered your\nquestions fairly and frankly, tell me what makes you associate with\nCraigengelt, so much beneath you both in birth and in spirit?”\n\n“In plain terms,” answered Bucklaw, “because I am a fool, who have\ngambled away my land in thse times. My grand-aunt, Lady Girnington, has\ntaen a new tack of life, I think, and I could only hope to get something\nby a change of government. Craigie was a sort of gambling acquaintance;\nhe saw my condition, and, as the devil is always at one's elbow, told\nme fifty lies about his credentials from Versailles, and his interest at\nSaint Germains, promised me a captain's commission at Paris, and I have\nbeen ass enough to put my thumb under his belt. I dare say, by this\ntime, he has told a dozen pretty stories of me to the government. And\nthis is what I have got by wine, women, and dice, cocks, dogs, and\nhorses.”\n\n“Yes, Bucklaw,” said the Master, “you have indeed nourished in your\nbosom the snakes that are now stinging you.”\n\n“That's home as well as true, Master,” replied his companion; “but, by\nyour leave, you have nursed in your bosom one great goodly snake\nthat has swallowed all the rest, and is as sure to devour you as my\nhalf-dozen are to make a meal on all that's left of Bucklaw, which is\nbut what lies between bonnet and boot-heel.”\n\n“I must not,” answered the Master of Ravenswood, “challenge the\nfreedom of speech in which I have set example. What, to speak without\na metaphor, do you call this monstrous passion which you charge me with\nfostering?”\n\n“Revenge, my good sir--revenge; which, if it be as gentle manlike a sin\nas wine and wassail, with their et coeteras, is equally unchristian, and\nnot so bloodless. It is better breaking a park-pale to watch a doe or\ndamsel than to shoot an old man.”\n\n“I deny the purpose,” said the Master of Ravenswood. “On my soul, I had\nno such intention; I meant but to confront the oppressor ere I left my\nnative land, and upbraid him with his tyranny and its consequences.\nI would have stated my wrongs so that they would have shaken his soul\nwithin him.”\n\n“Yes,” answered Bucklaw, “and he would have collared you, and cried\n'help,' and then you would have shaken the soul OUT of him, I suppose.\nYour very look and manner would have frightened the old man to death.”\n\n“Consider the provocation,” answered Ravenswood--“consider the ruin and\ndeath procured and caused by his hard-hearted cruelty--an ancient house\ndestroyed, an affectionate father murdered! Why, in our old Scottish\ndays, he that sat quiet under such wrongs would have been held neither\nfit to back a friend nor face a foe.”\n\n“Well, Master, I am glad to see that the devil deals as cunningly with\nother folk as he deals with me; for whenever I am about to commit any\nfolly, he persuades me it is the most necessary, gallant, gentlemanlike\nthing on earth, and I am up to saddlegirths in the bog before I see that\nthe ground is soft. And you, Master, might have turned out a murd----a\nhomicide, just out of pure respect for your father's memory.”\n\n“There is more sense in your language, Bucklaw,” replied the Master,\n“than might have been expected from your conduct. It is too true, our\nvices steal upon us in forms outwardly as fair as those of the demons\nwhom the superstitious represent as intriguing with the human race, and\nare not discovered in their native hideousness until we have clasped\nthem in our arms.”\n\n“But we may throw them from us, though,” said Bucklaw, “and that is\nwhat I shall think of doing one of these days--that is, when old Lady\nGirnington dies.”\n\n“Did you ever hear the expression of the English divine?” said\nRavenswood--“'Hell is paved with good intentions,'--as much as to say,\nthey are more often formed than executed.”\n\n“Well,” replied Bucklaw, “but I will begin this blessed night, and have\ndetermined not to drink above one quart of wine, unless your claret be\nof extraordinary quality.”\n\n“You will find little to tempt you at Wolf's Crag,” said the Master. “I\nknow not that I can promise you more than the shelter of my roof; all,\nand more than all, our stock of wine and provisions was exhausted at the\nlate occasion.”\n\n“Long may it be ere provision is needed for the like purpose,” answered\nBucklaw; “but you should not drink up the last flask at a dirge; there\nis ill luck in that.”\n\n“There is ill luck, I think, in whatever belongs to me,” said\nRavenswood. “But yonder is Wolf's Crag, and whatever it still contains\nis at your service.”\n\nThe roar of the sea had long announced their approach to the cliffs, on\nthe summit of which, like the nest of some sea-eagle, the founder of the\nfortalice had perched his eyrie. The pale moon, which had hitherto been\ncontending with flitting clouds, now shone out, and gave them a view\nof the solitary and naked tower, situated on a projecting cliff that\nbeetled on the German Ocean. On three sides the rock was precipitous;\non the fourth, which was that towards the land, it had been originally\nfenced by an artificial ditch and drawbridge, but the latter was broken\ndown and ruinous, and the former had been in part filled up, so as to\nallow passage for a horseman into the narrow courtyard, encircled on two\nsides with low offices and stables, partly ruinous, and closed on the\nlandward front by a low embattled wall, while the remaining side of the\nquadrangle was occupied by the tower itself, which, tall and narrow, and\nbuilt of a greyish stone, stood glimmering in the moonlight, like\nthe sheeted spectre of some huge giant. A wilder or more disconsolate\ndwelling it was perhaps difficult to conceive. The sombrous and heavy\nsound of the billows, successively dashing against the rocky beach at a\nprofound distance beneath, was to the ear what the landscape was to the\neye--a symbol of unvaried and monotonous melancholy, not unmingled with\nhorror.\n\nAlthough the night was not far advanced, there was no sign of living\ninhabitant about this forlorn abode, excepting that one, and only\none, of the narrow and stanchelled windows which appeared at irregular\nheights and distances in the walls of the building showed a small\nglimmer of light.\n\n“There,” said Ravenswood, “sits the only male domestic that remains to\nthe house of Ravenswood; and it is well that he does remain there, since\notherwise we had little hope to find either light or fire. But follow me\ncautiously; the road is narrow, and admits only one horse in front.”\n\nIn effect, the path led along a kind of isthmus, at the peninsular\nextremity of which the tower was situated, with that exclusive attention\nto strength and security, in preference to every circumstances of\nconvenience, which dictated to the Scottish barons the choice of their\nsituations, as well as their style of building.\n\nBy adopting the cautious mode of approach recommended by the proprietor\nof this wild hold, they entered the courtyard in safety. But it was long\nere the efforts of Ravenswood, though loudly exerted by knocking at the\nlow-browed entrance, and repeated shouts to Caleb to open the gate and\nadmit them, received any answer.\n\n“The old man must be departed,” he began to say, “or fallen into some\nfit; for the noise I have made would have waked the seven sleepers.”\n\nAt length a timid and hesitating voice replied: “Master--Master of\nRavenswood, is it you?”\n\n“Yes, it is I, Caleb; open the door quickly.”\n\n“But it is you in very blood and body? For I would sooner face fifty\ndeevils as my master's ghaist, or even his wraith; wherefore, aroint ye,\nif ye were ten times my master, unless ye come in bodily shape, lith and\nlimb.” “It is I, you old fool,” answered Ravenswood, “in bodily shape\nand alive, save that I am half dead with cold.”\n\nThe light at the upper window disappeared, and glancing from loophole to\nloophole in slow succession, gave intimation that the bearer was in\nthe act of descending, with great deliberation, a winding staircase\noccupying one of the turrets which graced the angles of the old tower.\nThe tardiness of his descent extracted some exclamations of impatience\nfrom Ravenswood, and several oaths from his less patient and more\nmecurial companion. Caleb again paused ere he unbolted the door, and\nonce more asked if they were men of mould that demanded entrance at this\ntime of night.\n\n“Were I near you, you old fool,” said Bucklaw, “I would give you\nsufficient proofs of MY bodily condition.”\n\n“Open the gate, Caleb,” said his master, in a more soothing tone, partly\nfrom his regard to the ancient and faithful seneschal, partly perhaps\nbecause he thought that angry words would be thrown away, so long as\nCaleb had a stout iron-clenched oaken door betwixt his person and the\nspeakers.\n\nAt length Caleb, with a trembling hand, undid the bars, opened the\nheavy door, and stood before them, exhibiting his thin grey hairs, bald\nforehead, and sharp high features, illuminated by a quivering lamp which\nhe held in one hand, while he shaded and protected its flame with the\nother. The timorous, courteous glance which he threw around him, the\neffect of the partial light upon his white hair and illumined features,\nmight have made a good painting; but our travellers were too impatient\nfor security against the rising storm to permit them to indulge\nthemselves in studying the picturesque. “Is it you, my dear master?--is\nit you yourself, indeed?” exclaimed the old domestic. “I am wae ye suld\nhae stude waiting at your ain gate; but wha wad hae thought o' seeing ye\nsae sune, and a strange gentleman with a--(Here he exclaimed apart, as\nit were, and to some inmate of the tower, in a voice not meant to be\nheard by those in the court)--Mysie--Mysie, woman! stir for dear life,\nand get the fire mended; take the auld three-legged stool, or ony\nthing that's readiest that will make a lowe. I doubt we are but puirly\nprovided, no expecting ye this some months, when doubtless ye was\nhae been received conform till your rank, as gude right is; but\nnatheless----”\n\n“Natheless, Caleb,” said the Master, “we must have our horses put up,\nand ourselves too, the best way we can. I hope you are not sorry to see\nme sooner than you expected?”\n\n“Sorry, my lord! I am sure ye sall aye be my lord wi' honest folk, as\nyour noble ancestors hae been these three hundred years, and never asked\na Whig's leave. Sorry to see the Lord of Ravenswood at ane o' his ain\ncastles! (Then again apart to his unseen associate behind the screen)\nMysie, kill the brood-hen without thinking twice on it; let them care\nthat come ahint. No to say it's our best dwelling,” he added, turning\nto Bucklaw; “but just a strength for the Lord of Ravenswood to flee\nuntil--that is, no to FLEE, but to retreat until in troublous times,\nlike the present, when it was ill convenient for him to live farther in\nthe country in ony of his better and mair principal manors; but, for its\nantiquity, maist folk think that the outside of Wolf's Crag is worthy of\na large perusal.”\n\n“And you are determined we shall have time to make it,” said Ravenswood,\nsomewhat amused with the shifts the old man used to detain them without\ndoors until his confederate Mysie had made her preparations within.\n\n“Oh, never mind the outside of the house, my good friend,” said Bucklaw;\n“let's see the inside, and let our horses see the stable, that's all.”\n “Oh yes, sir--ay, sir--unquestionably, sir--my lord and ony of his\nhonourable companions----”\n\n“But our horses, my friend--our horses; they will be dead-founded by\nstanding here in the cold after riding hard, and mine is too good to be\nspoiled; therefore, once more, our horses!” exclaimed Bucklaw.\n\n“True--ay--your horses--yes--I will call the grooms”; and sturdily did\nCaleb roar till the old tower rang again: “John--William--Saunders!\nThe lads are gane out, or sleeping,” he observed, after pausing for an\nanswer, which he knew that he had no human chance of receiving. “A'\ngaes wrang when the Master's out-bye; but I'll take care o' your cattle\nmysell.”\n\n“I think you had better,” said Ravenswood, “otherwise I see little\nchance of their being attended to at all.”\n\n“Whisht, my lord--whisht, for God's sake,” said Caleb, in an imploring\ntone, and apart to his master; “if ye dinna regard your ain credit,\nthink on mine; we'll hae hard eneugh wark to make a decent night o't,\nwi' a' the lees I can tell.”\n\n“Well, well, never mind,” said his master; “go to the stable. There is\nhay and corn, I trust?”\n\n“Ou ay, plenty of hay and corn”; this was uttered boldly and aloud, and,\nin a lower tone, “there was some half fous o' aits, and some taits o'\nmeadow-hay, left after the burial.”\n\n“Very well,” said Ravenswood, taking the lamp from his domestic's\nunwilling hand, “I will show the stranger upstairs myself.”\n\n“I canna think o' that, my lord; if ye wad but have five minutes, or ten\nminutes, or, at maist, a quarter of an hour's patience, and look at the\nfine moonlight prospect of the Bass and North Berwick Law till I sort\nthe horses, I would marshal ye up, as reason is ye suld be marshalled,\nyour lordship and your honourable visitor. And I hae lockit up the\nsiller candlesticks, and the lamp is not fit----”\n\n“It will do very well in the mean time,” said Ravenswood, “and you will\nhave no difficulty for want of light in the stable, for, if I recollect,\nhalf the roof is off.”\n\n“Very true, my lord,” replied the trusty adherent, and with ready wit\ninstantly added, “and the lazy sclater loons have never come to put it\non a' this while, your lordship.”\n\n“If I were disposed to jest at the calamities of my house,” said\nRavenswood, as he led the way upstairs, “poor old Caleb would furnish me\nwith ample means. His passion consists in representing things about our\nmiserable menage, not as they are, but as, in his opinion, they ought\nto be; and, to say the truth, I have been often diverted with the poor\nwretch's expedients to supply what he though was essential for the credit\nof the family, and his still more generous apologies for the want of\nthose articles for which his ingenuity could discover no substitute.\nBut though the tower is none of the largest, I shall have some trouble\nwithout him to find the apartment in which there is a fire.”\n\nAs he spoke thus, he opened the door of the hall. “Here, at least,” he\nsaid, “there is neither hearth nor harbour.”\n\nIt was indeed a scene of desolation. A large vaulted room, the beams of\nwhich, combined like those of Westminster Hall, were rudely carved at\nthe extremities, remained nearly in the situation in which it had been\nleft after the entertainment at Allan Lord Ravenswood's funeral.\nOverturned pitchers, and black-jacks, and pewter stoups, and flagons\nstill cumbered the large oaken table; glasses, those more perishable\nimplements of conviviality, many of which had been voluntarily\nsacrificed by the guests in their enthusiastic pledges to favourite\ntoasts, strewed the stone floor with their fragments. As for the\narticles of plate, lent for the purpose by friends and kinsfolk, those\nhad been carefully withdrawn so soon as the ostentatious display of\nfestivity, equally unnecessary and strangely timed, had been made and\nended. Nothing, in short, remained that indicated wealth; all the signs\nwere those of recent wastefulness and present desolation. The black\ncloth hangings, which, on the late mournful occasion, replaced the\ntattered moth-eaten tapestries, had been partly pulled down, and,\ndangling from the wall in irregular festoons, disclosed the rough\nstonework of the building, unsmoothed either by plaster or the chisel.\nThe seats thrown down, or left in disorder, intimated the careless\nconfusion which had concluded the mournful revel. “This room,” said\nRavenswood, holding up the lamp--“this room, Mr. Hayston, was riotous\nwhen it should have been sad; it is a just retribution that it should\nnow be sad when it ought to be cheerful.”\n\nThey left this disconsolate apartment, and went upstairs, where, after\nopening one or two doors in vain, Ravenswood led the way into a little\nmatted ante-room, in which, to their great joy, they found a tolerably\ngood fire, which Mysie, by some such expedient as Caleb had suggested,\nhad supplied with a reasonable quantity of fuel. Glad at the heart to see\nmore of comfort than the castle had yet seemed to offer, Bucklaw rubbed\nhis hands heartily over the fire, and now listened with more complacency\nto the apologies which the Master of Ravenswood offered. “Comfort,” he\nsaid, “I cannot provide for you, for I have it not for myself; it\nis long since these walls have known it, if, indeed, they were ever\nacquainted with it. Shelter and safety, I think, I can promise you.”\n\n“Excellent matters, Master,” replied Bucklaw, “and, with a mouthful of\nfood and wine, positively all I can require to-night.”\n\n“I fear,” said the Master, “your supper will be a poor one; I hear\nthe matter in discussion betwixt Caleb and Mysie. Poor Balderstone is\nsomething deaf, amongst his other accomplishments, so that much of what\nhe means should be spoken aside is overheard by the whole audience, and\nespecially by those from whom he is most anxious to conceal his private\nmanoeuvres. Hark!”\n\nThey listened, and heard the old domestic's voice in conversation with\nMysie to the following effect:\n\n“Just mak the best o't--make the besto't, woman; it's easy to put a fair\nface on ony thing.”\n\n“But the auld brood-hen? She'll be as teugh as bow-strings and\nbend-leather!”\n\n“Say ye made a mistake--say ye made a mistake, Mysie,” replied the\nfaithful seneschal, in a soothing and undertoned voice; “tak it a' on\nyoursell; never let the credit o' the house suffer.”\n\n“But the brood-hen,” remonstrated Mysie--“ou, she's sitting some gate\naneath the dais in the hall, and I am feared to gae in in the dark for\nthe dogle; and if I didna see the bogle, I could as ill see the hen, for\nit's pit-mirk, and there's no another light in the house, save that very\nblessed lamp whilk the Master has in his ain hand. And if I had the hen,\nshe's to pu', and to draw, and to dress; how can I do that, and them\nsitting by the only fire we have?”\n\n“Weel, weel, Mysie,” said the butler, “bide ye there a wee, and I'll try\nto get the lamp wiled away frae them.”\n\nAccordingly, Caleb Balderstone entered the apartment, little aware that\nso much of his by-play had been audible there. “Well, Caleb, my old\nfriend, is there any chance of supper?” said the Master of Ravenswood.\n\n“CHANCE of supper, your lordship?” said Caleb, with an emphasis of\nstrong scorn at the implied doubt. “How should there be ony question\nof that, and us in your lordship's house? Chance of supper, indeed! But\nye'll no be for butcher-meat? There's walth o' fat poultry, ready either\nfor spit or brander. The fat capon, Mysie!” he added, calling out as\nboldly as if such a thing had been in existence.\n\n“Quite unnecessary,” said Bucklaw, who deemed himself bound in courtesy\nto relieve some part of the anxious butler's perplexity, “if you have\nanything cold, or a morsel of bread.”\n\n“The best of bannocks!” exclaimed Caleb, much relieve; “and, for cauld\nmeat, a' that we hae is cauld eneugh,--how-beit, maist of the cauld meat\nand pastry was gien to the poor folk after the ceremony of interment, as\ngude reason was; nevertheless----”\n\n“Come, Caleb,” said the Master of Ravenswood, “I must cut this matter\nshort. This is the young Laird of Bucklaw; he is under hiding, and\ntherefore, you know----”\n\n“He'll be nae nicer than your lordship's honour, I'se warrant,” answered\nCaleb, cheerfully, with a nod of intelligence; “I am sorry that the\ngentleman is under distress, but I am blythe that he canna say muckle\nagane our housekeeping, for I believe his ain pinches may matach ours;\nno that we are pinched, thank God,” he added, retracting the admission\nwhich he had made in his first burst of joy, “but nae doubt we are waur\naff than we hae been, or suld be. And for eating--what signifies telling\na lee? there's just the hinder end of the mutton-ham that has been but\nthree times on the table, and the nearer the bane the sweeter, as your\nhonours weel ken; and--there's the heel of the ewe-milk kebbuck, wi' a\nbit of nice butter, and--and--that's a' that's to trust to.” And with\ngreat alacrity he produced his slender stock of provisions, and placed\nthem with much formality upon a small round table betwixt the two\ngentlemen, who were not deterred either by the homely quality or limited\nquantity of the repast from doing it full justice. Caleb in the mean\nwhile waited on them with grave officiousness, as if anxious to make up,\nby his own respectful assiduity, for the want of all other attendance.\n\nBut, alas! how little on such occasions can form, however anxiously and\nscrupulously observed, supply the lack of substantial fare! Bucklaw,\nwho had eagerly eaten a considerable portion of the thrice-sacked\nmutton-ham, now began to demand ale.\n\n“I wadna just presume to recommend our ale,” said Caleb; “the maut was\nill made, and there was awfu' thunner last week; but siccan water as the\nTower well has ye'll seldome see, Bucklaw, and that I'se engage for.”\n\n“But if your ale is bad, you can let us have some wine,” said Bucklaw,\nmaking a grimace at the mention of the pure element which Caleb so\nearnestly recommended.\n\n“Wine!” answered Caleb, undauntedly, “eneugh of wine! It was but twa\ndays syne--wae's me for the cause--there was as much wine drunk in this\nhouse as would have floated a pinnace. There never was lack of wine at\nWolf's Crag.”\n\n“Do fetch us some then,” said the master, “instead of talking about it.”\n And Caleb boldly departed.\n\nEvery expended butt in the old cellar did he set a-tilt, and shake with\nthe desperate expectation of collecting enough of the grounds of claret\nto fill the large pewter measure which he carred in his hand. Alas!\neach had been too devoutly drained; and, with all the squeezing and\nmanoeuvring which his craft as a butler suggested, he could only collect\nabout half a quart that seemed presentable. Still, however, Caleb was\ntoo good a general to renounce the field without a strategem to cover\nhis retreat. He undauntedly threw down an empty flagon, as if he had\nstumbled at the entrance of the apartment, called upon Mysie to wipe up\nthe wine that had never been spilt, and placing the other vessel on the\ntable, hoped there was still enough left for their honours. There\nwas indeed; for even Bucklaw, a sworn friend to the grape, found no\nencouragement to renew his first attack upon the vintage of Wolf's\nCrag, but contented himself, however reluctantly, with a draught of\nfair water. Arrangements were now made for his repose; and as the\nsecret chamber was assigned for this purpose, it furnished Caleb with a\nfirst-rate and most plausible apology for all deficiencies of furniture,\nbedding, etc.\n\n“For wha,” said he, “would have thought of the secret chaumer being\nneeded? It has not been used since the time of the Gowrie Conspiracy,\nand I durst never let a woman ken of the entrance to it, or your honour\nwill allow that it wad not hae been a secret chaumer lang.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n     The hearth in hall was black and dead,\n     No board was dight in bower within,\n     Nor merry bowl nor welcome bed;\n     “Here's sorry cheer,” quoth the Heir of Linne.\n\n     Old Ballad\n\nTHE feelings of the prodigal Heir of Linne, as expressed in that\nexcellent old song, when, after dissipating his whole fortune, he found\nhimself the deserted inhabitant of “the lonely lodge,” might perhaps\nhave some resemblance to those of the Master of Ravenswood in his\ndeserted mansion of Wolf's Crag. The Master, however, had this advantage\nover the spendthrift in the legend, that, if he was in similar distress,\nhe could not impute it to his own imprudence. His misery had been\nbequeathed to him by his father, and, joined to his high blood, and to\na title which the courteous might give or the churlish withhold at their\npleasure, it was the whole inheritance he had derived from his ancestry.\nPerhaps this melancholy yet consolatory reflection crossed the mind of\nthe unfortunate young nobleman with a breathing of comfort. Favourable\nto calm reflection, as well as to the Muses, the morning, while it\ndispelled the shades of night, had a composing and sedative effect upon\nthe stormy passions by which the Master of Ravenswood had been agitated\non the preceding day. He now felt himself able to analyse the different\nfeelings by which he was agitated, and much resolved to combat and\nto subdue them. The morning, which had arisen calm and bright, gave a\npleasant effect even to the waste moorland view which was seen from the\ncastle on looking to the landward; and the glorious ocean, crisped with\na thousand rippling waves of silver, extended on the other side, in\nawful yet complacent majesty, to the verge of the horizon. With such\nscenes of calm sublimity the human heart sympathises even in its most\ndisturbed moods, and deeds of honour and virtue are inspired by their\nmajestic influence. To seek out Bucklaw in the retreat which he had\nafforded him, was the first occupation of the Master, after he had\nperformed, with a scrutiny unusually severe, the important task of\nself-examination. “How now, Bucklaw?” was his morning's salutation--“how\nlike you the couch in which the exiled Earl of Angus once slept\nin security, when he was pursued by the full energy of a king's\nresentment?”\n\n“Umph!” returned the sleeper awakened; “I have little to complain of\nwhere so great a man was quartered before me, only the mattress was of\nthe hardest, the vault somewhat damp, the rats rather more mutinous than\nI would have expected from the state of Caleb's larder; and if there had\nbeen shutters to that grated window, or a curtain to the bed, I should\nthink it, upon the whole, an improvement in your accommodations.”\n\n“It is, to be sure, forlorn enough,” said the Master, looking around the\nsmall vault; “but if you will rise and leave it, Caleb will endeavour to\nfind you a better breakfast than your supper of last night.”\n\n“Pray, let it be no better,” said Bucklaw, getting up, and endeavouring\nto dress himself as well as the obscurity of the place would\npermit--“let it, I say, be no better, if you mean me to preserve in my\nproposed reformation. The very recollection of Caleb's beverage has done\nmore to suppress my longing to open the day with a morning draught than\ntwenty sermons would have done. And you, master, have you been able to\ngive battle valiantly to your bosom-snake? You see I am in the way of\nsmothering my vipers one by one.”\n\n“I have commenced the battle, at least, Bucklaw, adn I have had a fair\nvision of an angel who descended to my assistance,” replied the Master.\n\n“Woe's me!” said his guest, “no vision can I expect, unless my aunt,\nLady Grinington, should betake herself to the tomb; and then it would be\nthe substance of her heritage rather than the appearance of her phantom\nthat I should consider as the support of my good resolutions. But this\nsame breakfast, Master--does the deer that is to make the pasty run yet\non foot, as the ballad has it?”\n\n“I will inquire into that matter,” said his entertainer; and, leaving\nthe apartment, he went in search of Caleb, whom, after some difficulty,\nhe found in an obscure sort of dungeon, which had been in former times\nthe buttery of the castle. Here the old man was employed busily in the\ndoubtful task of burnishing a pewter flagon until it should take the\nhue and semblance of silver-plate. “I think it may do--I think it might\npass, if they winna bring it ower muckle in the light o' the window!”\n were the ejaculations which he muttered from time to time, as if to\nencourage himself in his undertaking, when he was interrupted by the\nvoice of his master.\n\n“Take this,” said the Master of Ravenswood, “and get what is necessary\nfor the family.” And with these words he gave to the old butler the\npurse which had on the preceding evening so narrowly escaped the fangs\nof Craigengelt.\n\nThe old man shook his silvery and thin locks, and looked with an\nexpression of the most heartfelt anguish at his master as he weighed in\nhis hand the slender treasure, and said in a sorrowful voice, “And is\nthis a' that's left?”\n\n“All that is left at present,” said the Master, affecting more\ncheerfulness than perhaps he really felt, “is just the green purse and\nthe wee pickle gowd, as the old song says; but we shall do better one\nday, Caleb.”\n\n“Before that day domes,” said Caleb, “I doubt there will be an end of\nan auld sang, and an auld serving-man to boot. But it disna become me to\nspeak that gate to your honour, adn you looking sae pale. Tak back\nthe purse, and keep it to be making a show before company; for if your\nhonour would just take a bidding, adn be whiles taking it out afore folk\nand putting it up again, there's naebody would refuse us trust, for a'\nthat's come and gane yet.”\n\n“But, Caleb,” said the Master, “I still intend to leave this country\nvery soon, and desire to do so with the reputation of an honest man,\nleaving no debty behind me, at last of my own contracting.”\n\n“And gude right ye suld gang away as a true man, and so ye shall; for\nauld Caleb can tak the wyte of whatever is taen on for the house, and\nthen it will be a' just ae man's burden; and I will live just as weel in\nthe tolbooth as out of it, and the credit of the family will be a' safe\nand sound.”\n\nThe Master endeavoured, in vain, to make Caleb comprehend that the\nbutler's incurring the responsibility of debts in his own person would\nrather add to than remove the objections which he had to their being\ncontracted. He spoke to a premier too busy in devising ways and means to\npuzzle himself with refuting the arguments offered against their justice\nor expediency.\n\n“There's Eppie Sma'trash will trust us for ale,” said Caleb to\nhimself--“she has lived a' her life under the family--and maybe wi' a\nsoup brandy; I canna say for wine--she is but a lone woman, and gets\nher claret by a runlet at a time; but I'll work a wee drap out o' her by\nfair means or foul. For doos, there's the doocot; there will be poultry\namang the tenants, though Luckie Chirnside says she has paid the kain\ntwice ower. We'll mak shift, an it like your honour--we'll mak shift;\nkeep your heart abune, for the house sall haud its credit as lang as\nauld Caleb is to the fore.”\n\nThe entertainment which the old man's exertions of various kinds\nenabled him to present to the young gentlemen for three or four days was\ncertainly of no splendid description, but it may readily be believed\nit was set before no critical guests; and even the distresses, excuses,\nevasions, and shifts of Caleb afforded amusement to the young men, and\nadded a sort of interest to the scrambling and irregular style of their\ntable. They had indeed occasion to seize on every circumstance that\nmight serve to diversify or enliven time, which otherwise passed away so\nheavily.\n\nBucklaw, shut out from his usual field-sports and joyous carouses by the\nnecessity of remaining concealed within the walls of the castle, became\na joyless and uninteresting companion. When the Master of Ravenswood\nwould no longer fence or play at shovel-board; when he himself had\npolished to the extremity the coat of his palfrey with brush, curry\ncomb, and hair-cloth; when he had seen him eat his provender, and\ngently lie down in his stall, he could hardly help envying the animal's\napparent acquiescence in a life so monotonous. “The stupid brute,” he\nsaid, “thinks neither of the race-ground or the hunting-field, or\nhis green paddock at Bucklaw, but enjoys himself as comfortably when\nhaltered to the rack in this ruinous vault, as if he had been foaled\nin it; and, I who have the freedom of a prisoner at large, to range\nthrough the dungeons of this wretched old tower, can hardly,\nbetwixt whistling and sleeping, contrive to pass away the hour till\ndinner-time.”\n\nAnd with this disconsolate reflection, he wended his way to the bartizan\nor battlements of the tower, to watch what objects might appear on the\ndistant moor, or to pelt, with pebbles and pieces of lime, the sea-mews\nand cormorants which established themselves incautiously within the\nreach of an idle young man.\n\nRavenswood, with a mind incalculably deeper and more powerful than that\nof his companion, had his own anxious subjects of reflection, which\nwrought for him the same unhappiness that sheer enui and want of\noccupation inflicted on his companion. The first sight of Lucy Ashton\nhad been less impressive than her image proved to be upon reflection. As\nthe depth and violence of that revengeful passion by which he had been\nactuated in seeking an interview with the father began to abate by\ndegrees, he looked back on his conduct towards the daughter as harsh\nand unworthy towards a female of rank and beauty. Her looks of grateful\nacknowledgment, her words of affectionate courtesy, had been repelled\nwith something which approached to disdain; and if the Master of\nRavenswood had sustained wrongs at the hand of Sir William Ashton, his\nconscience told him they had been unhandsomely resented towards his\ndaughter. When his thoughts took this turn of self-reproach, the\nrecollection of Lucy Ashton's beautiful features, rendered yet more\ninteresting by the circumstances in which their meeting had taken place,\nmade an impression upon his mind at once soothing and painful. The\nsweetness of her voice, the delicacy of her expressions, the vivid glow\nof her filial affection, embittered his regret at having repulsed her\ngratitude with rudeness, while, at the same time, they placed before his\nimagination a picture of the most seducing sweetness.\n\nEven young Ravenswood's strength of moral feeling and rectitude of\npurpose at once increased the danger of cherishing these recollections,\nand the propensity to entertain them. Firmly resolved as he was to\nsubdue, if possible, the predominating vice in his character, he\nadmitted with willingness--nay, he summoned up in his imagination--the\nideas by which it could be most powerfully counteracted; and, while he\ndid so, a sense of his own harsh conduct towards the daughter of his\nenemy naturally induced him, as if by way of recompense, to invest her\nwith more of grace and beauty than perhaps she could actually claim.\n\nHad any one at this period told the Master of Ravenswood that he had\nso lately vowed vengeance against the whole lineage of him whom he\nconsidered, not unjustly, as author of his father's ruin and death, he\nmight at first have repelled the charge as a foul calumny; yet, upon\nserious self-examination, he would have been compelled to admit that it\nhad, at one period, some foundation in truth, though, according to the\npresent tone of his sentiments, it was difficult to believe that this\nhad really been the case.\n\nThere already existed in his bosom two contradictory passions--a desire\nto revenge the death of his father, strangely qualified by admiration of\nhis enemy's daughter. Against the former feeling he had struggled, until\nit seemed to him upon the wane; against the latter he used no means of\nresistance, for he did not suspect its existence. That this was actually\nthe case was chiefly evinced by his resuming his resolution to leave\nScotland. Yet, though such was his purpose, he remained day after day at\nWolf's Crag, without taking measures for carrying it into execution.\nIt is true, that he had written to one or two kinsmen who resided in a\ndistant quarter of Scotland, and particularly to the Marquis of A----,\nintimating his purpose; and when pressed upon the subject by Bucklaw, he\nwas wont to allege the necessity of waiting for their reply, especially\nthat of the Marquis, before taking so decisive a measure.\n\nThe Marquis was rich and powerful; and although he was suspected to\nentertain sentiments unfavourable to the government established at the\nRevolution, he had nevertheless address enough to head a party in\nthe Scottish privy council, connected with the High Church faction in\nEngland, and powerful enough to menace those to whom the Lord Keeper\nadhered with a probable subversion of their power. The consulting with\na personage of such importance was a plausible excise, which Ravenswood\nused to Bucklaw, and probably to himself, for continuing his residence\nat Wolf's Crag; and it was rendered yet more so by a general report\nwhich began to be current of a probable change of ministers and measures\nin the Scottish administration. The rumours, strongly asserted by\nsome, and as resolutely denied by others, as their wishes or interest\ndictated, found their way even to the ruinous Tower of Wolf's Crag,\nchiefly through the medium of Caleb, the butler, who, among his other\nexcellences, was an ardent politician, and seldom made an excursion\nfrom the old fortress to the neighbouring village of Wolf's Hope without\nbringing back what tidings were current in the vicinity.\n\nBut if Bucklaw could not offer any satisfactory objections to the delay\nof the Master in leaving Scotland, he did not the less suffer with\nimpatience the state of inaction to which it confined him; and it was\nonly the ascendency which his new companion had acquired over him that\ninduced him to submit to a course of life so alien to his habits and\ninclinations.\n\n“You were wont to be thought a stirring active young fellow, Master,”\n was his frequent remonstrance; “yet here you seem determined to live\non and on like a rat in a hole, with this trifling difference, that the\nwiser vermin chooses a hermitage where he can find food at least; but as\nfor us, Caleb's excuses become longer as his diet turns more spare, and\nI fear we shall realise the stories they tell of the slother: we have\nalmost eat up the last green leaf on the plant, and have nothing left\nfor it but to drop from the tree and break our necks.”\n\n“Do not fear it,” said Ravenswood; “there is a fate watches for us, and\nwe too have a stake in the revolution that is now impending, and which\nalready has alarmed many a bosom.”\n\n“What fate--what revolution?” inquired his companion. “We have had one\nrevolution too much already, I think.”\n\nRavenswood interrupted him by putting into his hands a letter.\n\n“Oh,” answered Bucklaw, “my dream's out. I thought I heard Caleb this\nmorning pressing some unfortunate fellow to a drink of cold water, and\nassuring him it was better for his stomach in the morning than ale or\nbrandy.”\n\n“It was my Lord of A----'s courier,” said Ravenswood, “who was doomed to\nexperience his ostentatious hospitality, which I believe ended in sour\nbeer and herrings. Read, and you will see the news he has brought us.”\n “I will as fast as I can,” said Bucklaw; “but I am no great clerk, nor\ndoes his lordship seem to be the first of scribes.”\n\nThe reader will peruse in, a few seconds, by the aid our friend\nBallantyne's types, what took Bucklaw a good half hour in perusal,\nthough assisted by the Master of Ravenswood. The tenor was as follows:\n\n\n“RIGHT HONOURABLE OUR COUSIN:\n\n“Our hearty commendations premised, these come to assure you of the\ninterest which we take in your welfare, and in your purpose towards its\naugmentation. If we have been less active in showing forth our effective\ngood-will towards you than, as a loving kinsman and blood-relative, we\nwould willingly have desired, we request that you will impute it to lack\nof opportunity to show our good-liking, not to any coldness of our will\nTouching your resolution to travel in foreign parts, as at this time we\nhold the same little advisable, in respect that your ill-willers may,\naccording to the custom of such persons, impute motives for your\njourney, whereof, although we know and believe you to be as clear as\nourselves, yet natheless their words may find credence in places where\nthe belief in them may much prejudice you, and which we should see with\nmore unwillingness and displeasure than with means of remedy.\n\n“Having thus, as becometh our kindred, given you our poor mind on the\nsubject of your journeying forth of Scotland, we would willingly\nadd reasons of weight, which might materially advantage you and your\nfather's house, thereby to determine you to abide at Wolf's Crag, until\nthis harvest season shall be passed over. But what sayeth the proverb,\nverbum sapienti--a word is more to him that hath wisdom than a sermon to\na fool. And albeit we have written this poor scroll with our own hand,\nand are well assured of the fidelity of our messenger, as him that is\nmany ways bounden to us, yet so it is, that sliddery ways crave wary\nwalking, and that we may not peril upon paper matters which we would\ngladly impart to you by word of mouth. Wherefore, it was our purpose to\nhave prayed you heartily to come to this our barren Highland country to\nkill a stag, and to treat of the matters which we are now more painfully\ninditing to you anent. But commodity does not serve at present for such\nour meeting, which, therefore, shall be deferred until sic time as we\nmay in all mirth rehearse those things whereof we now keep silence.\nMeantime, we pray you to think that we are, and will still be, your good\nkinsman and well-wisher, waiting but for times of whilk we do, as it\nwere, entertain a twilight prospect, and appear and hope to be also your\neffectual well-doer. And in which hope we heartily write ourself,\n\n“Right Honourable,\n\n“Your loving cousin,\n\n“A----.\n“Given from our poor house of B----,” etc.\n\n\nSuperscribed--“For the right honourable, and our honoured kinsman, the\nMaster of Ravenswood--These, with haste, haste, post haste--ride and run\nuntil these be delivered.”\n\n“What think you of this epistle, Bucklaw?” said the Master, when his\ncompanion had hammered out all the sense, and almost all the words of\nwhich it consisted.\n\n“Truly, that the Marquis's meaning is as great a riddle as his\nmanuscript. He is really in much need of _Wit's Interpreter_, or the\n_Complete Letter-Writer_, and were I you, I would send him a copy by the\nbearer. He writes you very kindly to remain wasting your time and\nyour money in this vile, stupid, oppressed country, without so much as\noffering you the countenance and shelter of his house. In my opinion, he\nhas some scheme in view in which he supposes you can be useful, and he\nwishes to keep you at hand, to make use of you when it ripens,\nreserving the power of turning you adrift, should his plot fail in the\nconcoction.”\n\n“His plot! Then you suppose it is a treasonable business,” answered\nRavenswood.\n\n“What else can it be?” replied Bucklaw; “the Marquis has been long\nsuspected to have an eye to Saint Germains.”\n\n“He should not engage me rashly in such an adventure,” said Ravenswood;\n“when I recollect the times of the first and second Charles, and of the\nlast James, truly I see little reason that, as a man or a patriot, I\nshould draw my sword for their descendants.”\n\n“Humph!” replied Bucklaw; “so you have set yourself down to mourn over\nthe crop-eared dogs whom honest Claver'se treated as they deserved?”\n\n“They first gave the dogs an ill name, and then hanged them,” replied\nRavenswood. “I hope to see the day when justice shall be open to Whig\nand Tory, and when these nicknames shall only be used among coffee-house\npoliticians, as 'slut' and 'jade' are among apple-women, as cant terms\nof idle spite and rancour.”\n\n“That will nto be in our days, Master: the iron has entered too deeply\ninto our sides and our souls.”\n\n“It will be, however, one day,” replied the Master; “men will not always\nstart at these nicknames as at a trumpet-sound. As social life is better\nprotected, its comforts will become too dear to be hazarded without some\nbetter reasons than speculative politics.”\n\n“It is fine talking,” answered Bucklaw; “but my heart is with the old\nsong--\n\n     To see good corn upon the rigs,\n     And a gallow built to hang the Whigs,\n     And the right restored where the right should be.\n     Oh, that is the thing that would wanton me.”\n\n“You may sing as loudly as you will, cantabit vacuus----,” answered the\nMaster; “but I believe the Marquis is too wise, at least too wary, to\njoin you in such a burden. I suspect he alludes to a revolution in the\nScottish privy council, rather than in the British kingdoms.”\n\n“Oh, confusion to your state tricks!” exclaimed Bucklaw--“your cold\ncalculating manoeuvres, which old gentlemen in wrought nightcaps\nand furred gowns execute like so many games at chess, and displace a\ntreasurer or lord commissioner as they would take a rook or a pawn.\nTennis for my sport, and battle for my earnest! And you, Master, so dep\nand considerate as you would seem, you have that within you makes\nthe blood boil faster than suits your present humour of moralising on\npolitical truths. You are one of those wise men who see everything with\ngreat composure till their blood is up, and then--woe to any one who\nshould put them in mind of their own prudential maxims!” “Perhaps,” said\nRavenswood, “you read me more rightly than I can myself. But to think\njustly will certainly go some length in helping me to act so. But hark!\nI hear Caleb tolling the dinner-bell.”\n\n“Which he always does with the more sonorous grace in proportion to the\nmeagreness of the cheer which he has provided,” said Bucklaw; “as if\nthat infernal clang and jangle, which will one day bring the belfry\ndown the cliff, could convert a starved hen into a fat capon, and a\nblade-bone of mutton into a haunch of venison.”\n\n“I wish we may be so well off as your worst conjectures surmise,\nBucklaw, from the extreme solemnity and ceremony with which Caleb seems\nto place on the table that solitary covered dish.”\n\n“Uncover, Caleb! uncover, for Heaven's sake!” said Bucklaw; “let us have\nwhat you can give us without preface. Why, it stands well enough, man,”\n he continued, addressing impatiently the ancient butler, who, without\nreply, kept shifting the dish, until he had at length placed it with\nmathematical precision in the very midst of the table.\n\n“What have we got here, Caleb?” inquired the Master in his turn.\n\n“Ahem! sir, ye suld have known before; but his honour the Laird of\nBucklaw is so impatient,” answered Caleb, still holding the dish with\none hand and the cover with the other, with evident reluctance to\ndisclose the contents.\n\n“But what is it, a God's name--not a pair of clean spurs, I hope, in the\nBorder fashion of old times?”\n\n“Ahem! ahem!” reiterated Caleb, “your honour is pleased to be facetious;\nnatheless, I might presume to say it was a convenient fashion, and used,\nas I have heard, in an honourable and thriving family. But touching your\npresent dinner, I judged that this being St. Magdalen's [Margaret's]\nEve, who was a worthy queen of Scotland in her day, your honours might\njudge it decorous, if not altogether to fast, yet only to sustain nature\nwith some slight refection, as ane saulted herring or the like.” And,\nuncovering the dish, he displayed four of the savoury fishes which he\nmentioned, adding, in a subdued tone, “that they were no just common\nherring neither, being every ane melters, and sauted with uncommon care\nby the housekeeper (poor Mysie) for his honour's especial use.”\n\n“Out upon all apologies!” said the Master, “let us eat the herrings,\nsince there is nothing better to be had; but I begin to think with you,\nBucklaw, that we are consuming the last green leaf, and that, in spite\nof the Marquis's political machinations, we must positively shift camp\nfor want of forage, without waiting the issue of them.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n     Ay, and when huntsmen wind the merry horn,\n     And from its covert starts the fearful prey,\n     Who, warm'd with youth's blood in his swelling veins,\n     Would, like a lifeless clod, outstretched lie,\n     Shut out from all the fair creation offers?\n\n     Ethwald, Act I. Scene 1.\n\nLIGHT meals procure light slumbers; and therefore it is not surprising\nthat, considering the fare which Caleb's conscience, or his necessity,\nassuming, as will sometimes happen, that disguise, had assigned to the\nguests of Wolf's Crag, their slumbers should have been short.\n\nIn the morning Bucklaw rushed into his host's apartment with a loud\nhalloo, which might have awaked the dead.\n\n“Up! up! in the name of Heaven! The hunters are out, the only piece of\nsport I have seen this month; and you lie here, Master, on a bed that\nhas little to recommend it, except that it may be something softer than\nthe stone floor of your ancestor's vault.”\n\n“I wish,” said Ravenswood, raising his head peevishly, “you had forborne\nso early a jest, Mr. Hayston; it is really no pleasure to lose the very\nshort repose which I had just begun to enjoy, after a night spent in\nthoughts upon fortune far harder than my couch, Bucklaw.”\n\n“Pschaw, pshaw!” replied his guest; “get up--get up; the hounds are\nabroad. I have saddled the horses myself, for old Caleb was calling for\ngrooms and lackeys, and would never have proceeded without two hours'\napology for the absence of men that were a hundred miles off. Get up,\nMaster; I say the hounds are out--get up, I say; the hunt is up.” And\noff ran Bucklaw.\n\n“And I say,” said the Master, rising slowly, “that nothing can concern\nme less. Whose hounds come so near to us?”\n\n“The Honourable Lord Brittlebrains's,” answered Caleb, who had followed\nthe impatient Laird of Bucklaw into his master's bedroom, “and truly I\nken nae title they have to be yowling and howling within the freedoms\nand immunities of your lordship's right of free forestry.”\n\n“Nor I, Caleb,” replied Ravenswood, “excepting that they have bought\nboth the lands and the right of forestry, and may think themselves\nentitled to exercise the rights they have paid their money for.”\n\n“It may be sae, my lord,” replied Caleb; “but it's no gentleman's deed\nof them to come here and exercise such-like right, and your lordship\nliving at your ain castle of Wolf's Crag. Lord Brittlebrains would weel\nto remember what his folk have been.”\n\n“And what we now are,” said the Master, with suppressed bitterness of\nfeeling. “But reach me my cloak, Caleb, and I will indulge Bucklaw with\na sight of this chase. It is selfish to sacrifice my guest's pleasure to\nmy own.”\n\n“Sacrifice!” echoed Caleb, in a tone which seemed to imply the total\nabsurdity of his master making the least concession in deference to any\none--“sacrifice, indeed!--but I crave your honour's pardon, and whilk\ndoublet is it your pleasure to wear?”\n\n“Any one you will, Caleb; my wardrobe, I suppose, is not very\nextensive.”\n\n“Not extensive!” echoed his assistant; “when there is the grey and\nsilver that your lordship bestowed on Hew Hildebrand, your outrider;\nand the French velvet that went with my lord your father--be gracious\nto him!--my lord your father's auld wardrobe to the puir friends of the\nfamily; and the drap-de-Berry----”\n\n“Which I gave to you, Caleb, and which, I suppose, is the only dress we\nhave any chance to come at, except that I wore yesterday; pray, hand me\nthat, and say no more about it.”\n\n“If your honour has a fancy,” replied Caleb, “and doubtless it's a\nsad-coloured suit, and you are in mourning; nevertheless, I have never\ntried on the drap-de-Berry--ill wad it become me--and your honour having\nno change of claiths at this present--and it's weel brushed, and as\nthere are leddies down yonder----”\n\n“Ladies!” said Ravenswood; “and what ladies, pray?”\n\n“What do I ken, your lordship? Looking down at them from the Warden's\nTower, I could but see them glent by wi' their bridles ringing and their\nfeathers fluttering, like the court of Elfland.”\n\n“Well, well, Caleb,” replied the Master, “help me on with my cloak, and\nhand me my sword-belt. What clatter is that in the courtyard?”\n\n“Just Bucklaw bringing out the horses,” said Caleb, after a glance\nthrough the window, “as if there werena men eneugh in the castle, or as\nif I couldna serve the turn of ony o' them that are out o' the gate.”\n\n“Alas! Caleb, we should want little if your ability were equal to your\nwill,” replied the Master.\n\n“And I hope your lordship disna want that muckle,” said Caleb; “for,\nconsidering a' things, I trust we support the credit of the family as\nweel as things will permit of,--only Bucklaw is aye sae frank and sae\nforward. And there he has brought out your lordship's palfrey, without\nthe saddle being decored wi' the broidered sumpter-cloth! and I could\nhave brushed it in a minute.”\n\n“It is all very well,” said his master, escaping from him and descending\nthe narrow and steep winding staircase which led to the courtyard.\n\n“It MAY be a' very weel,” said Caleb, somewhat peevishly; “but if your\nlordship wad tarry a bit, I will tell you what will NOT be very weel.”\n\n“And what is that?” said Ravenswood, impatiently, but stopping at the\nsame time.\n\n“Why, just that ye suld speer ony gentleman hame to dinner; for I canna\nmak anither fast on a feast day, as when I cam ower Bucklaw wi' Queen\nMargaret; and, to speak truth, if your lordship wad but please to cast\nyoursell in the way of dining wi' Lord Bittlebrains, I'se warrand I wad\ncast about brawly for the morn; or if, stead o' that, ye wad but dine\nwi' them at the change-house, ye might mak your shift for the awing: ye\nmight say ye had forgot your purse, or that the carline awed ye rent,\nand that ye wad allow it in the settlement.”\n\n“Or any other lie that cam uppermost, I suppose?” said his master.\n“Good-bye, Caleb; I commend your care for the honour of the family.”\n And, throwing himself on his horse, he followed Bucklaw, who, at the\nmanifest risk of his neck, had begun to gallop down the steep path which\nled from the Tower as soon as he saw Ravenswood have his foot in the\nstirrup.\n\nCaleb Balderstone looked anxiously after them, and shook his thin grey\nlocks: “And I trust they will come to no evil; but they have reached\nthe plain, and folk cannot say but that the horse are hearty and in\nspirits.” Animated by the natural impetuosity and fire of his temper,\nyoung Bucklaw rushed on with the careless speed of a whirlwind.\nRavenswood was scarce more moderate in his pace, for his was a mind\nunwillingly roused from contemplative inactivity, but which, when once\nput into motion, acquired a spirit of forcible and violent progression.\nNeither was his eagerness proportioned in all cases to the motive of\nimpulse, but might be compared to the sped of a stone, which rushes with\nlike fury down the hill whether it was first put in motion by the arm of\na giant or the hand of a boy. He felt, therefore, in no ordinary degree,\nthe headlong impulse of the chase, a pastime so natural to youth of\nall ranks, that it seems rather to be an inherent passion in our animal\nnature, which levels all differences of rank and education, than an\nacquired habit of rapid exercise.\n\nThe repeated bursts of the French horn, which was then always used for\nthe encouragement and direction of the hounds; the deep, though distant\nbaying of the pack; the half-heard cries of the huntsmen; the half-seen\nforms which were discovered, now emerging from glens which crossed the\nmoor, now sweeping over its surface, now picking their way where it\nwas impeded by morasses; and, above all, the feeling of his own rapid\nmotion, animated the Master of Ravenswood, at last for the moment, above\nthe recollections of a more painful nature by which he was surrounded.\nThe first thing which recalled him to those unpleasing circumstances\nwas feeling that his horse, notwithstanding all the advantages which he\nreceived from his rider's knowledge of the country, was unable to keep\nup with the chase. As he drew his bridle up with the bitter feeling\nthat his poverty excluded him from the favourite recreation of his\nforefathers, and indeed their sole employment when not engaged in\nmilitary pursuits, he was accosted by a well-mounted stranger, who,\nunobserved, had kept near him during the earlier part of his career.\n\n“Your horse is blown,” said the man, with a complaisance seldom used in\na hunting-field. “Might I crave your honour to make use of mine?”\n\n“Sir,” said Ravenswood, more surprised than pleased at such a proposal.\n“I really do not know how I have merited such a favour at a stranger's\nhands.”\n\n“Never ask a question about it, Master,” said Bucklaw, who, with great\nunwillingness, had hitherto reined in his own gallant steed, not to\noutride his host and entertainer. “Take the goods the gods provide you,\nas the great John Dryden says; or stay--here, my friend, lend me that\nhorse; I see you have been puzzled to rein him up this half-hour. I'll\ntake the devil out of him for you. Now, Master, do you ride mine, which\nwill carry you like an eagle.”\n\nAnd throwing the rein of his own horse to the Master of Ravenswood, he\nsprung upon that which the stranger resigned to him, and continued\nhis career at full speed. “Was ever so thoughtless a being!” said the\nMaster; “and you, my friend, how could you trust him with your horse?”\n\n“The horse,” said the man, “belongs to a person who will make your\nhonour, or any of your honourable friends, most welcome to him, flesh\nand fell.”\n\n“And the owner's name is----?” asked Ravenswood.\n\n“Your honour must excuse me, you will learn that from himself. If you\nplease to take your friend's horse, and leave me your galloway, I will\nmeet you after the fall of the stag, for I hear they are blowing him at\nbay.”\n\n“I believe, my friend, it will be the best way to recover your good\nhorse for you,” answered Ravenswood; and mounting the nag of his friend\nBucklaw, he made all the haste in his power to the spot where the blast\nof the horn announced that the stag's career was nearly terminated.\n\nThese jovial sounds were intermixed with the huntsmen's shouts of “Hyke\na Talbot! Hyke a Teviot! now, boys, now!” and similar cheering halloos\nof the olden hunting-field, to which the impatient yelling of the\nhounds, now close of the object of their pursuit, gave a lively and\nunremitting chorus. The straggling riders began now to rally towards the\nscene of action, collecting from different points as to a common centre.\n\nBucklaw kept the start which he had gotten, and arrived first at the\nspot, where the stag, incapable of sustaining a more prolonged flight,\nhad turned upon the hounds, and, in the hunter's phrase, was at bay.\nWith his stately head bent down, his sides white with foam, his eyes\nstrained betwixt rage and terror, the hunted animal had now in his turn\nbecome an object of intimidation to his pursuers. The hunters came\nup one by one, and watched an opportunity to assail him with some\nadvantage, which, in such circumstances, can only be done with caution.\nThe dogs stood aloof and bayed loudly, intimating at once eagerness and\nfear, and each of the sportsmen seemed to expect that his comrade would\ntake upon him the perilous task of assaulting and disabling the animal.\nThe ground, which was a hollow in the common or moor, afforded little\nadvantage for approaching the stag unobserved; and general was the shout\nof triumph when Bucklaw, with the dexterity proper to an accomplished\ncavalier of the day, sprang from his horse, and dashing suddenly and\nswiftly at the stag, brought him to the ground by a cut on the hind leg\nwith his short hunting-sword. The pack, rushing in upon their disabled\nenemy, soon ended his painful struggles, and solemnised his fall with\ntheir clamour; the hunters, with their horns and voices, whooping and\nblowing a mort, or death-note, which resounded far over the billows of\nthe adjacent ocean.\n\nThe huntsman then withdrew the hounds from the throttled stag, and on\nhis knee presented his knife to a fair female form, on a white palfrey,\nwhose terror, or perhaps her compassion, had till then kept her at some\ndistance. She wore a black silk riding-mask, which was then a common\nfashion, as well for preserving the complexion from the sun and rain, as\nfrom an idea of decorum, which did not permit a lady to appear barefaced\nwhile engaged in a boisterous sport, and attended by a promiscuous\ncompany. The richness of her dress, however, as well as the mettle and\nform of her palfrey, together with the silvan compliment paid to her by\nthe huntsman, pointed her out to Bucklaw as the principal person in\nthe field. It was not without a feeling of pity, approaching even\nto contempt, that this enthusiastic hunter observed her refuse the\nhuntsman's knife, presented to her for the purpose of making the first\nincision in the stag's breast, and thereby discovering the venison. He\nfelt more than half inclined to pay his compliments to her; but it had\nbeen Bucklaw's misfortune, that his habits of life had not rendered\nhim familiarly acquainted with the higher and better classes of female\nsociety, so that, with all his natural audacity, he felt sheepish and\nbashful when it became necessary to address a lady of distinction.\n\nTaking unto himself heart of grace (to use his own phrase), he did at\nlength summon up resolution enough to give the fair huntress good time\nof the day, and trust that her sport had answered her expectation. Her\nanswer was very courteously and modestly expressed, and testified some\ngratitude to the gallant cavalier, whose exploit had terminated the\nchase so adroitly, when the hounds and huntsmen seemed somewhat at a\nstand.\n\n“Uds daggers and scabbard, madam,” said Bucklaw, whom this observation\nbrought at once upon his own ground, “there is no difficulty or merit in\nthat matter at all, so that a fellow is not too much afraid of having a\npair of antlers in his guts. I have hunted at force five hundred times,\nmadam; and I never yet saw the stag at bay, by land or water, but I\ndurst have gone roundly in on him. It is all use and wont, madam; and\nI'll tell you, madam, for all that, it must be done with good heed and\ncaution; and you will do well, madam, to have your hunting-sword right\nsharp and double-edged, that you may strike either fore-handed or\nback-handed, as you see reason, for a hurt with a buck's horn is a\nperilous ad somewhat venomous matter.”\n\n“I am afraid, sir,” said the young lady, and her smile was scarce\nconcealed by her vizard, “I shall have little use for such careful\npreparation.”\n\n“But the gentleman says very right for all that, my lady,” said an\nold huntsman, who had listened to Bucklaw's harangue with no small\nedification; “and I have heard my father say, who was a forester at the\nCabrach, that a wild boar's gaunch is more easily healed than a hurt\nfrom the deer's horn, for so says the old woodman's rhyme--\n\n     If thou be hurt with horn of hart, it brings thee to they bier;\n     But tusk of boar shall leeches heal, thereof have lesser fear.”\n\n“An I might advise,” continued Bucklaw, who was now in his element, and\ndesirous of assuming the whole management, “as the hounds are surbated\nand weary, the head of the stag should be cabaged in order to reward\nthem; and if I may presume to speak, the huntsman, who is to break up\nthe stag, ought to drink to your good ladyship's health a good lusty\nbicker of ale, or a tass of brandy; for if he breaks him up without\ndrinking, the venison will not keep well.”\n\nThis very agreeable prescription received, as will be readily believed,\nall acceptation from the huntsman, who, in requital, offered to bucklaw\nthe compliment of his knife, which the young lady had declined.\n\nThis polite proffer was seconded by his mistress. “I believe, sir,” she\nsaid, withdrawing herself from the circle, “that my father, for whose\namusement Lord Bittlebrain's hounds have been out to-day, will readily\nsurrender all care of these matters to a gentleman of your experience.”\n\nThen, bending gracefully from her horse, she wished him good morning,\nand, attended by one or two domestics, who seemed immediately attached\nto her service, retired from the scene of action, to which Bucklaw, too\nmuch delighted with an opportunity of displaying his woodcraft to care\nabout man or woman either, paid little attention; but was soon stript to\nhis doublet, with tucked-up sleeves, and naked arms up to the elbows\nin blood and grease, slashing, cutting, hacking, and hewing, with the\nprecision of Sir Tristrem himself, and wrangling and disputing with all\naround him concerning nombles, briskets, flankards, and raven-bones,\nthen usual terms of the art of hunting, or of butchery, whichever the\nreader chooses to call it, which are now probably antiquated.\n\nWhen Ravenswood, who followed a short pace behind his friend, saw that\nthe stag had fallen, his temporary ardour for the chase gave way to that\nfeeling of reluctance which he endured at encountering in his fallen\nfortunes the gaze whether of equals or inferiors. He reined up his horse\non the top of a gentle eminence, from which he observed the busy and gay\nscene beneath him, and heard the whoops of the huntsmen, gaily mingled\nwith the cry of the dogs, and the neighing and trampling of the horses.\nBut these jovial sounds fell sadly on the ear of the ruined nobleman.\nThe chase, with all its train of excitations, has ever since feudal\ntimes been accounted the almost exclusive privilege of the aristocracy,\nand was anciently their chief employment in times of peace. The sense\nthat he was excluded by his situation from enjoying the silvan sport,\nwhich his rank assigned to him as a special prerogative, and the feeling\nthat new men were now exercising it over the downs which had been\njealously reserved by his ancestors for their own amusement, while he,\nthe heir of the domain, was fain to hold himself at a distance from\ntheir party, awakened reflections calculated to depress deeply a mind\nlike Ravenswood's, which was naturally contemplative and melancholy. His\npride, however, soon shook off this feeling of dejection, and it gave\nway to impatience upon finding that his volatile friend Bucklaw seemed\nin no hurry to return with his borrowed steed, which Ravenswood, before\nleaving the field, wished to see restored to the obliging owner. As he\nwas about to move towards the group of assembled huntsmen, he was joined\nby a horseman, who, like himself, had kept aloof during the fall of the\ndeer.\n\nThis personage seemed stricken in years. He wore a scarlet cloak,\nbuttoning high upon his face, and his hat was unlooped and slouched,\nprobably by way of defence against the weather. His horse, a strong and\nsteady palfrey, was calculated for a rider who proposed to witness the\nsport of the day rather than to share it. An attendant waited at some\ndistance, and the whole equipment was that of an elderly gentleman of\nrank and fashion. He accosted Ravenswood very politely, but not without\nsome embarrassment.\n\n“You seem a gallant young gentleman, sir,” he said, “and yet appear as\nindifferent to this brave sport as if you had my load of years on your\nshoulders.”\n\n“I have followed the sport with more spirit on other occasions,” replied\nthe Master; “at present, late events in my family must be my apology;\nand besides,” he added, “I was but indifferently mounted at the\nbeginning of the sport.”\n\n“I think,” said the stranger, “one of my attendants had the sense to\naccommodate your friend with a horse.”\n\n“I was much indebted to his politeness and yours,” replied Ravenswood.\n“My friend is Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw, whom I dare say you will be\nsure to find in the thick of the keenest sportsmen. He will return\nyour servant's horse, and take my pony in exchange; and will add,”\n he concluded, turning his horse's head from the stranger, “his best\nacknowledgments to mine for the accommodation.”\n\nThe Master of Ravenswood, having thus expressed himself, began to move\nhomeward, with the manner of one who has taken leave of his company.\nBut the stranger was not so to be shaken off. He turned his horse at the\nsame time, and rode in the same direction, so near to the Master that,\nwithout outriding him, which the formal civility of the time, and\nthe respect due to the stranger's age and recent civility, would have\nrendered improper, he could not easily escape from his company.\n\nThe stranger did not long remain silent. “This, then,” he said, “is the\nancient Castle of Wolf's Crag, often mentioned in the Scottish records,”\n looking to the old tower, then darkening under the influence of a stormy\ncloud, that formed its background; for at the distance of a short mile,\nthe chase, having been circuitous, had brought the hunters nearly back\nto the point which they had attained when Ravenswood and Bucklaw had set\nforward to join them.\n\nRavenswood answered this observation with a cold and distant assent.\n“It was, as I have heard,” continued the stranger, unabashed by his\ncoldness, “one of the most early possessions of the honourable family of\nRavenswood.”\n\n“Their earliest possession,” answered the Master, “and probably their\nlatest.”\n\n“I--I--I should hope not, sir,” answered the stranger, clearing his\nvoice with more than one cough, and making an effort to overcome a\ncertain degree of hesitation; “Scotland knows what she owes to\nthis ancient family, and remembers their frequent and honourable\nachievements. I have little doubt that, were it properly represented\nto her Majesty that so ancient and noble a family were subjected to\ndilapidation--I mean to decay--means might be found, ad re-aedificandum\nantiquam domum----”\n\n“I will save you the trouble, sir, of discussing this point farther,”\n interrupted the Master, haughtily. “I am the heir of that unfortunate\nhouse--I am the Master of Ravenswood. And you, sir, who seem to be\na gentleman of fashion and education, must be sensible that the next\nmortification after being unhappy is the being loaded with undesired\ncommiseration.”\n\n“I beg your pardon, sir,” said the elder horseman; “I did not know--I am\nsensible I ought not to have mentioned--nothing could be farther from my\nthoughts than to suppose----”\n\n“There are no apologies necessary, sir,” answered Ravenswood, “for here,\nI suppose, our roads separate, and I assure you that we part in perfect\nequanimity on my side.”\n\nAs speaking these words, he directed his horse's head towards a narrow\ncauseway, the ancient approach to Wolf's Crag, of which it might be\ntruly said, in the words of the Bard of Hope, that\n\n     Frequented by few was the grass-cover'd road,\n     Where the hunter of deer and the warrior trode,\n     To his hills that encircle the sea.\n\nBut, ere he could disengage himself from his companion, the young lady\nwe have already mentioned came up to join the stranger, followed by her\nservants.\n\n“Daughter,” said the stranger to the unmasked damsel, “this is the\nMaster of Ravenswood.”\n\nIt would have been natural that the gentleman should have replied to\nthis introduction; but there was something in the graceful form and\nretiring modesty of the female to whom he was thus presented, which not\nonly prevented him from inquiring to whom, and by whom, the annunciation\nhad been made, but which even for the time struck him absolutely mute.\nAt this moment the cloud which had long lowered above the height on\nwhich Wolf's Crag is situated, and which now, as it advanced, spread\nitself in darker and denser folds both over land and sea, hiding the\ndistant objects and obscuring those which were nearer, turning the sea\nto a leaden complexion and the heath to a darker brown, began now, by\none or two distant peals, to announce the thunders with which it was\nfraught; while two flashes of lightning, following each other very\nclosely, showed in the distance the grey turrets of Wolf's Crag, and,\nmore nearly, the rollowing billows of the ocean, crested suddenly with\nred and dazzling light.\n\nThe horse of the fair huntress showed symptoms of impatience and\nrestiveness, and it became impossible for Ravenswood, as a man or a\ngentleman, to leave her abruptly to the case of an aged father or her\nmenial attendants. He was, or believed himself, obliged in courtesy to\ntake hold of her bridle, and assist her in managing the unruly animal.\nWhile he was thus engaged, the old gentleman observed that the storm\nseemed to increase; that they were far from Lord Bittlebrains's, whose\nguests they were for the present; and that he would be obliged to the\nMaster of Ravenswood to point him the way to the nearest place of refuge\nfrom the storm. At the same time he cast a wistful and embarrassed\nlook towards the Tower of Wolf's Crag, which seemed to render it almost\nimpossible for the owner to avoid offering an old man and a lady, in\nsuch an emergency, the temporary use of his house. Indeed, the condition\nof the young huntress made this courtesy indispensable; for, in the\ncourse of the services which he rendered, he could not but perceive that\nshe trembled much, and was extremely agitated, from her apprehensions,\ndoubtless, of the coming storm.\n\nI know not if the Master of Ravenswood shared her terrors, but he was\nnot entirely free from something like a similar disorder of nerves, as\nhe observed, “The Tower of Wolf's Crag has nothing to offer beyond the\nshelter of its roof, but if that can be acceptable at such a moment----”\n he paused, as if the rest of the invitation stuck in his throat. But\nthe old gentleman, his self-constituted companion, did not allow him to\nrecede from the invitation, which he had rather suffered to be implied\nthan directly expressed.\n\n“The storm,” said the stranger, “must be an apology for waiving\nceremony; his daughter's health was weak, she had suffered much from a\nrecent alarm; he trusted their intrusion on the Master of Ravenswood's\nhospitality would not be altogether unpardonable in the circumstances of\nthe case: his child's safety must be dearer to him than ceremony.”\n\nThere was no room to retreat. The Master of Ravenswood led the way,\ncontinuing to keep hold of the lady's bridle to prevent her horse\nfrom starting at some unexpected explosion of thunder. He was not so\nbewildered in his own hurried reflections but that he remarked, that the\ndeadly paleness which had occupied her neck and temples, and such of her\nfeatures as the riding-mask left exposed, gave place to a deep and rosy\nsuffusion; and he felt with embarrassment that a flush was by tacit\nsympathy excited in his own cheeks. The stranger, with watchfulness\nwhich he disguised under apprehensions of the safety of his daughter,\ncontinued to observe the expression of the Master's countenance as\nthey ascended the hill to Wolf's Crag. When they stood in front of\nthat ancient fortress, Ravenswood's emotions were of a very complicated\ndescription; and as he led the way into the rude courtyard, and hallooed\nto Caleb to give attendance, there was a tone of sternness, almost of\nfierceness, which seemed somewhat alien from the courtesies of one who\nis receiving honoured guests.\n\nCaleb came; and not the paleness of the fair stranger at the first\napproach of the thunder, nor the paleness of any other person, in any\nother circumstances whatever, equalled that which overcame the thin\ncheeks of the disconsolate seneschal when he beheld this accession\nof guests to the castle, and reflected that the dinner hour was fast\napproaching. “Is he daft?” he muttered to himself;--“is he clean daft\na'thegither, to bring lords and leddies, and a host of folk behint them,\nand twal o'clock chappit?” Then approaching the Master, he craved pardon\nfor having permitted the rest of his people to go out to see the hunt,\nobserving, that “They wad never think of his lordship coming back till\nmirk night, and that he dreaded they might play the truant.”\n\n“Silence, Balderstone!” said Ravenswood, sternly; “your folly is\nunseasonable. Sir and madam,” he said, turning to his guests, “this old\nman, and a yet older and more imbecile female domestic, form my whole\nretinue. Our means of refreshing you are more scanty than even so\nmiserable a retinue, and a dwelling so dilapidated, might seem to\npromise you; but, such as they may chance to be, you may command them.”\n\nThe elder stranger, struck with the ruined and even savage appearance of\nthe Tower, rendered still more disconsolate by the lowering and gloomy\nsky, and perhaps not altogether unmoved by the grave and determined\nvoice in which their host addressed them, looked round him anxiously, as\nif he half repented the readiness with which he had accepted the offered\nhospitality. But there was now no opportunity of receding from the\nsituation in which he had placed himself.\n\nAs for Caleb, he was so utterly stunned by his master's public and\nunqualified acknowledgment of the nakedness of the land, that for two\nminutes he could only mutter within his hebdomadal beard, which had not\nfelt the razor for six days, “He's daft--clean daft--red wud, and awa'\nwit! But deil hae Caleb Balderstone,” said he, collecting his powers of\ninvention and resource, “if the family shall lose credit, if he were as\nmad as the seven wise masters!” He then boldly advanced, and in spite\nof his master's frowns and impatience, gravely asked, “If he should\nnot serve up some slight refection for the young leddy, and a glass of\ntokay, or old sack--or----”\n\n“Truce to this ill-timed foolery,” said the Master, sternly; “put the\nhorses into the stable, and interrupt us no more with your absurdities.”\n\n“Your honour's pleasure is to be obeyed aboon a' things,” said Caleb;\n“nevertheless, as for the sack and tokay which it is not your noble\nguests' pleasure to accept----”\n\nBut here the voice of Bucklaw, heard even above the clattering of\nhoofs and braying of horns with which it mingled, announced that he was\nscaling the pathway to the Tower at the head of the greater part of the\ngallant hunting train.\n\n“The deil be in me,” said Caleb, taking heart in spite of this new\ninvasion of Philistines, “if they shall beat me yet! The hellicat\nne'er-do-weel! to bring such a crew here, that will expect to find\nbrandy as plenty as ditch-water, and he kenning sae absolutely the case\nin whilk we stand for the present! But I trow, could I get rid of thae\ngaping gowks of flunkies that hae won into the courtyard at the back\nof their betters, as mony a man gets preferment, I could make a' right\nyet.”\n\nThe measures which he took to execute this dauntless resolution, the\nreader shall learn in the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n     With throat unslaked, with black lips baked,\n     Agape they heard him call;\n     Gramercy they for joy did grin,\n     And all at once their breath drew in,\n     As they had been drinking all!\n\n     COLERIDGE'S Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\n\nHAYSTON of Bucklaw was one of the thoughtless class who never hesitate\nbetween their friend and their jest. When it was announced that the\nprincipal persons of the chase had taken their route towards Wolf's\nCrag, the huntsmen, as a point of civility, offered to transfer the\nvenison to that mansion; a proffer which was readily accepted by\nBucklaw, who thought much of the astonishment which their arrival in\nfull body would occasion poor old Caleb Balderstone, and very little of\nthe dilemma to which he was about to expose his friend the Master, so\nill circumstanced to receive such a party. But in old Caleb he had to\ndo with a crafty and alert antagonist, prompt at supplying, upon all\nemergencies, evasions and excuses suitable, as he thought, to the\ndignity of the family.\n\n“Praise be blest!” said Caleb to himself, “ae leaf of the muckle gate\nhas been swung to wi' yestreen's wind, and I think I can manage to shut\nthe ither.”\n\nBut he was desirous, like a prudent governor, at the same time to get\nrid, if possible, of the internal enemy, in which light he considered\nalmost every one who eat and drank, ere he took measures to exclude\nthose whom their jocund noise now pronounced to be near at hand. He\nwaited, therefore, with impatience until his master had shown his two\nprincipal guests into the Tower, and then commenced his operations.\n\n“I think,” he said to the stranger menials, “that, as they are bringing\nthe stag's head to the castle in all honour, we, who are indwellers,\nshould receive them at the gate.”\n\nThe unwary grooms had no sooner hurried out, in compliance with this\ninsidious hint, than, one folding-door of the ancient gate being already\nclosed by the wind, as has been already intimated, honest Caleb lost\nno time in shutting the other with a clang, which resounded from\ndonjon-vault to battlement. Having thus secured the pass, he forthwith\nindulged the excluded huntsmen in brief parley, from a small projecting\nwindow, or shot-hole, through which, in former days, the warders were\nwont to reconnoitre those who presented themselves before the gates. He\ngave them to understand, in a short and pity speech, that the gate of\nthe castle was never on any account opened during meal-times; that his\nhonour, the Master of Ravenswood, and some guests of quality, had\njust sat down to dinner; that there was excellent brandy at the\nhostler-wife's at Wolf's Hope down below; and he held out some obscure\nhint that the reckoning would be discharged by the Master; but this was\nuttered in a very dubious and oracular strain, for, like Louis XIV.,\nCaleb Balderstone hesitated to carry finesse so far as direct falsehood,\nand was content to deceive, if possible, without directly lying.\n\nThis annunciation was received with surprise by some, with laughter\nby others, and with dismay by the expelled lackeys, who endeavoured to\ndemonstrate that their right of readmission, for the purpose of waiting\nupon their master and mistress, was at least indisputable. But Caleb was\nnot in a humour to understand or admit any distinctions. He stuck to his\noriginal proposition with that dogged but convenient pertinacity which\nis armed against all conviction, and deaf to all reasoning. Bucklaw now\ncame from the rear of the party, and demanded admittance in a very angry\ntone. But the resolution of Caleb was immovable.\n\n“If the king on the throne were at the gate,” he declared, “his ten\nfingers should never open it contrair to the established use and wont of\nthe family of Ravenswood, and his duty as their head-servant.”\n\nBucklaw was now extremely incensed, and with more oaths and curses\nthan we care to repeat, declared himself most unworthily treated, and\ndemanded peremptorily to speak with the Master of Ravenswood himself.\n\nBut to this also Caleb turned a deaf ear. “He's as soon a-bleeze as a\ntap of tow, the lad Bucklaw,” he said; “but the deil of ony master's\nface he shall see till he has sleepit and waken'd on't. He'll ken\nhimsell better the morn's morning. It sets the like o' him, to be\nbringing a crew of drunken hunters here, when he kens there is but\nlittle preparation to sloken his ain drought.” And he disappeared from\nthe window, leaving them all to digest their exclusion as they best\nmight.\n\nBut another person, of whose presence Caleb, in the animation of the\ndebate, was not aware, had listened in silence to its progress. This\nwas the principal domestic of the stranger--a man of trust and\nconsequence--the same who, in the hunting-field, had accommodated\nBucklaw with the use of his horse. He was in the stable when Caleb had\ncontrived the expulsion of his fellow-servants, and thus avoided sharing\nthe same fate, from which his personal importance would certainly not\nhave otherwise saved him.\n\nThis personage perceived the manoeuvre of Caleb, easily appreciated the\nmotive of his conduct, and knowing his master's intentions towards the\nfamily of Ravenswood, had no difficulty as to the line of conduct he\nought to adopt. He took the place of Caleb (unperceived by the latter)\nat the post of audience which he had just left, and announced to the\nassembled domestics, “That it was his master's pleasure that Lord\nBittlebrain's retinue and his own should go down to the adjacent\nchange-house and call for what refreshments they might have occasion\nfor, and he should take care to discharge the lawing.”\n\nThe jolly troop of huntsmen retired from the inhospitable gate of Wolf's\nCrag, execrating, as they descended the steep pathway, the niggard and\nunworthy disposition of the proprietor, and damning, with more than\nsilvan license, both the castle and its inhabitants. Bucklaw, with many\nqualities which would have made him a man of worth and judgment in more\nfavourable circumstances, had been so utterly neglected in point of\neducation, that he was apt to think and feel according to the ideas of\nthe companions of his pleasures. The praises which had recently been\nheaped upon himself he contrasted with the general abuse now levelled\nagainst Ravenswood; he recalled to his mind the dull and monotonous days\nhe had spent in the Tower of Wolf's Crag, compared with the joviality\nof his usual life; he felt with great indignation his exclusion from\nthe castle, which he considered as a gross affront, and every mingled\nfeeling led him to break off the union which he had formed with the\nMaster of Ravenswood.\n\nOn arriving at the change-house of the village of Wolf's Hope, he\nunexpectedly met with an acquaintance just alighting from his horse.\nThis was no other than the very respectable Captain Craigengelt,\nwho immediately came up to him, and, without appearing to retain any\nrecollection of the indifferent terms on which they had parted, shook\nhim by the hand in the warmest manner possible. A warm grasp of the\nhand was what Bucklaw could never help returning with cordiality, and no\nsooner had Craigengelt felt the pressure of his fingers than he knew the\nterms on which he stood with him.\n\n“Long life to you, Bucklaw!” he exclaimed; “there's life for honest folk\nin this bad world yet!”\n\nThe Jacobites at this period, with what propriety I know not, used, it\nmust be noticed, the term of HONEST MEN as peculiarly descriptive of\ntheir own party.\n\n“Ay, and for others besides, it seems,” answered Bucklaw; “otherways,\nhow came you to venture hither, noble Captain?”\n\n“Who--I? I am as free as the wind at Martinmas, that pays neither\nland-rent nor annual; all is explained--all settled with the honest old\ndrivellers yonder of Auld Reekie. Pooh! pooh! they dared not keep me a\nweek of days in durance. A certain person has better friends among them\nthan you wot of, and can serve a friend when it is least likely.”\n\n“Pshaw!” answered Hayston, who perfectly knew and thoroughly despised\nthe character of this man, “none of your cogging gibberish; tell me\ntruly, are you at liberty and in safety?”\n\n“Free and safe as a Whig bailie on the causeway of his own borough, or a\ncanting Presbyterian minister in his own pulpit; and I came to tell you\nthat you need not remain in hiding any longer.”\n\n“Then I suppose you call yourself my friend, Captain Craigengelt?” said\nBucklaw.\n\n“Friend!” replied Craigengelt, “my cock of the pit! why, I am thy very\nAchates, man, as I have heard scholars say--hand and glove--bark and\ntree--thine to life and death!”\n\n“I'll try that in a moment,” answered Bucklaw. “Thou art never without\nmoney, however thou comest by it. Lend me two pieces to wash the dust\nout of these honest fellows' throats in the first place, and then----”\n\n“Two pieces! Twenty are at thy service, my lad, and twenty to back\nthem.”\n\n“Ay, say you so?” said Bucklaw, pausing, for his natural penetration led\nhim to suspect some extraordinary motive lay couched under an excess of\ngenerosity. “Craigengelt, you are either an honest fellow in right good\nearnest, and I scarce know how to believe that; or you are cleverer than\nI took you for, and I scarce know how to believe that either.”\n\n“L'un n'empeche pas l'autre,” said Craigengelt. “Touch and try; the gold\nis good as ever was weighed.”\n\nHe put a quantity of gold pieces into Bucklaw's hand, which he thrust\ninto his pocket without either counting or looking at them, only\nobserving, “That he was so circumstanced that he must enlist, though\nthe devil offered the press-money”; and then turning to the huntsmen, he\ncalled out, “Come along, my lads; all is at my cost.”\n\n“Long life to Bucklaw!” shouted the men of the chase.\n\n“And confusion to him that takes his share of the sport, and leaves the\nhunters as dry as a drumhead,” added another, by way of corollary.\n\n“The house of Ravenswood was ance a gude and an honourable house in\nthis land,” said an old man; “but it's lost its credit this day, and the\nMaster has shown himself no better than a greedy cullion.”\n\nAnd with this conclusion, which was unanimously agreed to by all who\nheard it, they rushed tumultuously into the house of entertainment,\nwhere they revelled till a late hour. The jovial temper of Bucklaw\nseldom permitted him to be nice in the choice of his associates; and on\nthe present occasion, when his joyous debauch received additional\nzest from the intervention of an unusual space of sobriety, and almost\nabstinence, he was as happy in leading the revels as if his comrades had\nbeen sons of princes. Craigengelt had his own purposes in fooling him up\nto the top of his bent; and having some low humour, much impudence, and\nthe power of singing a good song, understanding besides thoroughly the\ndisposition of his regained associate, he headily succeeded in involving\nhim bumper-deep in the festivity of the meeting.\n\n\nA very different scene was in the mean time passing in the Tower of\nWolf's Crag. When the Master of Ravenswood left the courtyard, too\nmuch busied with his own perplexed reflections to pay attention to the\nmanoeuvre of Caleb, he ushered his guests into the great hall of the\ncastle.\n\nThe indefatigable Balderstone, who, from choice or habit, worked on from\nmorning to night, had by degrees cleared this desolate apartment of the\nconfused relics of the funeral banquet, and restored it to some order.\nBut not all his skill and labour, in disposing to advantage the little\nfurniture which remained, could remove the dark and disconsolate\nappearance of those ancient and disfurnished walls. The narrow windows,\nflanked by deep indentures into the walls, seemed formed rather to\nexclude than to admit the cheerful light; and the heavy and gloomy\nappearance of the thunder-sky added still farther to the obscurity.\n\nAs Ravenswood, with the grace of a gallant of that period, but not\nwithout a certain stiffness and embarrassment of manner, handed the\nyoung lady to the upper end of the apartment, her father remained\nstanding more near to the door, as if about to disengage himself from\nhis hat and cloak. At this moment the clang of the portal was heard, a\nsound at which the stranger started, stepped hastily to the window, and\nlooked with an air of alarm at Ravenswood, when he saw that the gate of\nthe court was shut, and his domestics excluded.\n\n“You have nothing to fear, sir,” said Ravenswood, gravely; “this roof\nretains the means of giving protection, though not welcome. Methinks,”\n he added, “it is time that I should know who they are that have thus\nhighly honoured my ruined dwelling!” The young lady remained silent\nand motionless, and the father, to whom the question was more directly\naddressed, seemed in the situation of a performer who has ventured to\ntake upon himself a part which he finds himself unable to present,\nand who comes to a pause when it is most to be expected that he should\nspeak. While he endeavoured to cover his embarrassment with the exterior\nceremonials of a well-bred demeanour, it was obvious that, in making his\nbow, one foot shuffled forward, as if to advance, the other backward, as\nif with the purpose of escape; and as he undid the cape of his coat, and\nraised his beaver from his face, his fingers fumbled as if the one had\nbeen linked with rusted iron, or the other had weighed equal with a\nstone of lead. The darkness of the sky seemed to increase, as if to\nsupply the want of those mufflings which he laid aside with such evident\nreluctance. The impatience of Ravenswood increased also in proportion to\nthe delay of the stranger, and he appeared to struggle under agitation,\nthough probably from a very different cause. He laboured to restrain his\ndesire to speak, while the stranger, to all appearance, was at a loss\nfor words to express what he felt necessary to say.\n\nAt length Ravenswood's impatience broke the bounds he had imposed upon\nit. “I perceive,” he said, “that Sir William Ashton is unwilling to\nannounced himself in the Castle of Wolf's Crag.”\n\n“I had hoped it was unnecessary,” said the Lord Keeper, relieved from\nhis silence, as a spectre by the voice of the exorcist, “and I am\nobliged to you, Master of Ravenswood, for breaking the ice at once,\nwhere circumstances--unhappy circumstances, let me call them--rendered\nself-introduction peculiarly awkward.”\n\n“And I am not then,” said the Master of Ravenswood, gravely, “to\nconsider the honour of this visit as purely accidental?”\n\n“Let us distinguish a little,” said the Keeper, assuming an appearance\nof ease which perhaps his heart was a stranger to; “this is an honour\nwhich I have eagerly desired for some time, but which I might never\nhave obtained, save for the accident of the storm. My daughter and I are\nalike grateful for this opportunity of thanking the brave man to whom\nshe owes her life and I mine.”\n\nThe hatred which divided the great families in the feudal times had lost\nlittle of its bitterness, though it no longer expressed itself in\ndeeds of open violence. Not the feelings which Ravenswood had begun to\nentertain towards Lucy Ashton, not the hospitality due to his guests,\nwere able entirely to subdue, though they warmly combated, the deep\npassions which arose within him at beholding his father's foe standing\nin the hall of the family of which he had in a great measure accelerated\nthe ruin. His looks glanced from the father to the daughter with an\nirresolution of which Sir William Ashton did not think it proper\nto await the conclusion. He had now disembarrassed himself of his\nriding-dress, and walking up to his daughter, he undid the fastening of\nher mask.\n\n“Lucy, my love,” he said, raising her and leading her towards\nRavenswood, “lay aside your mask, and let us express our gratitude to\nthe Master openly and barefaced.”\n\n“If he will condescend to accept it,” was all that Lucy uttered; but in\na tone so sweetly modulated, and which seemed to imply at once a feeling\nand a forgiving of the cold reception to which they were exposed,\nthat, coming from a creature so innocent and so beautiful, her words cut\nRavenswood to the very heart for his harshness. He muttered something\nof surprise, something of confusion, and, ending with a warm and eager\nexpression of his happiness at being able to afford her shelter under\nhis roof, he saluted her, as the ceremonial of the time enjoined upon\nsuch occasions. Their cheeks had touched and were withdrawn from each\nother; Ravenswood had not quitted the hand which he had taken in kindly\ncourtesy; a blush, which attached more consequence by far than was usual\nto such ceremony, still mantled on Lucy Ashton's beautiful cheek, when\nthe apartment was suddenly illuminated by a flash of lightning, which\nseemed absolutely to swallow the darkness of the hall. Every object\nmight have been for an instant seen distinctly. The slight and\nhalf-sinking form of Lucy Ashton; the well-proportioned and stately\nfigure of Ravenswood, his dark features, and the fiery yet irresolute\nexpression of his eyes; the old arms and scutcheons which hung on the\nwalls of the apartment, were for an instant distinctly visible to the\nKeeper by a strong red brilliant glare of light. Its disappearance was\nalmost instantly followed by a burst of thunder, for the storm-cloud was\nvery near the castle; and the peal was so sudden and dreadful, that the\nold tower rocked to its foundation, and every inmate concluded it was\nfalling upon them. The soot, which had not been disturbed for centuries,\nshowered down the huge tunnelled chimneys; lime and dust flew in clouds\nfrom the wall; and, whether the lightning had actually struck the castle\nor whether through the violent concussion of the air, several heavy\nstones were hurled from the mouldering battlements into the roaring\nsea beneath. It might seem as if the ancient founder of the castle were\nbestriding the thunderstorm, and proclaiming his displeasure at the\nreconciliation of his descendant with the enemy of his house.\n\nThe consternation was general, and it required the efforts of both the\nLord Keeper and Ravenswood to keep Lucy from fainting. Thus was the\nMaster a second time engaged in the most delicate and dangerous of\nall tasks, that of affording support and assistance to a beautiful and\nhelpless being, who, as seen before in a similar situation, had\nalready become a favourite of his imagination, both when awake and when\nslumbering. If the genius of the house really condemned a union betwixt\nthe Master and his fair guest, the means by which he expressed his\nsentiments were as unhappily chosen as if he had been a mere mortal.\nThe train of little attentions, absolutely necessary to soothe the young\nlady's mind, and aid her in composing her spirits, necessarily threw\nthe Master of Ravenswood into such an intercourse with her father as was\ncalculated, for the moment at least, to break down the barrier of feudal\nenmity which divided them. To express himself churlishly, or even\ncoldly, towards an old man whose daughter (and SUCH a daughter) lay\nbefore them, overpowered with natural terror--and all this under his own\nroof, the thing was impossible; and by the time that Lucy, extending a\nhand to each, was able to thank them for their kindness, the Master\nfelt that his sentiments of hostility towards the Lord Keeper were by no\nmeans those most predominant in his bosom.\n\nThe weather, her state of health, the absence of her attendants,\nall prevented the possibility of Lucy Ashton renewing her journey to\nBittlebrains House, which was full five miles distant; and the Master of\nRavenswood could not but, in common courtesy, offer the shelter of his\nroof for the rest of the day and for the night. But a flush of less\nsoft expression, a look much more habitual to his features, resumed\npredominance when he mentioned how meanly he was provided for the\nentertainment of his guests.\n\n“Do not mention deficiencies,” said the Lord Keeper, eager to interrupt\nhim and prevent his resuming an alarming topic; “you are preparing to\nset out for the Continent, and your house is probably for the present\nunfurnished. All this we understand; but if you mention inconvenience,\nyou will oblige us to seek accommodations in the hamlet.”\n\nAs the Master of Ravenswood was about to reply, the door of the hall\nopened, and Caleb Balderstone rushed in.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n     Let them have meat enough, woman--half a hen;\n     There be old rotten pilchards--put them off too;\n     'Tis but a little new anointing of them,\n     And a strong onion, that confounds the savour.\n\n     Love's Pilgrimage.\n\nTHE thunderbolt, which had stunned all who were within hearing of it,\nhad only served to awaken the bold and inventive genius of the flower of\nmajors-domo. Almost before the clatter had ceased, and while there was\nyet scarce an assurance whether the castle was standing or falling,\nCaleb exclaimed, “Heaven be praised! this comes to hand like the boul of\na pint-stoup.” He then barred the kitchen door in the face of the Lord\nKeeper's servant, whom he perceived returning from the party at the\ngate, and muttering, “How the deil cam he in?--but deil may care. Mysie,\nwhat are ye sitting shaking and greeting in the chimney-neuk for? Come\nhere--or stay where ye are, and skirl as loud as ye can; it's a' ye're\ngude for. I say, ye auld deevil, skirl--skirl--louder--louder, woman;\ngar the gentles hear ye in the ha'. I have heard ye as far off as the\nBass for a less matter. And stay--down wi' that crockery----”\n\nAnd with a sweeping blow, he threw down from a shelf some articles of\npewter and earthenware. He exalted his voice amid the clatter, shouting\nand roaring in a manner which changed Mysie's hysterical terrors of the\nthunder into fears that her old fellow-servant was gone distracted. “He\nhas dung down a' the bits o' pigs, too--the only thing we had left\nto haud a soup milk--and he has spilt the hatted hit that was for the\nMaster's dinner. Mercy save us, the auld man's gaen clean and clear wud\nwi' the thunner!”\n\n“Haud your tongue, ye b----!” said Caleb, in the impetuous and\noverbearing triumph of successful invention, “a's provided now--dinner\nand a'thing; the thunner's done a' in a clap of a hand!”\n\n“Puir man, he's muckle astray,” said Mysie, looking at him with a\nmixture of pity and alarm; “I wish he may ever come hame to himsell\nagain.”\n\n“Here, ye auld doited deevil,” said Caleb, still exulting\nin his extrication from a dilemma which had seemed insurmountable;\n“keep the strange man out of the kitchen; swear the thunner\ncame down the chimney and spoiled the best dinner ye ever\ndressed--beef--bacon--kid--lark--leveret--wild-fowl--venison, and what\nnot. Lay it on thick, and never mind expenses. I'll awa' up to the\nla'. Make a' the confusion ye can; but be sure ye keep out the strange\nservant.”\n\nWith these charges to his ally, Caleb posted up to the hall, but\nstopping to reconnoitre through an aperture, which time, for the\nconvenience of many a domestic in succession, had made in the door, and\nperceiving the situation of Miss Ashton, he had prudence enough to\nmake a pause, both to avoid adding to her alarm and in order to secure\nattention to his account of the disastrous effects of the thunder.\n\nBut when he perceived that the lady was recovered, and heard the\nconversation turn upon the accommodation and refreshment which the\ncastle afforded, he thought it time to burst into the room in the manner\nannounced in the last chapter.\n\n“Willawins!--willawins! Such a misfortune to befa' the house of\nRavenswood, and I to live to see it.”\n\n“What is the matter, Caleb?” said his master, somewhat alarmed in his\nturn; “has any part of the castle fallen?”\n\n“Castle fa'an! na, but the sute's fa'an, and the thunner's come right\ndown the kitchen-lum, and the things are a' lying here awa', there awa',\nlike the Laird o' Hotchpotch's lands; and wi' brave guests of honour\nand quality to entertain (a low bow here to Sir William Ashton and his\ndaughter), and naething left in the house fit to present for dinner, or\nfor supper either, for aught that I can see!”\n\n“I very believe you, Caleb,” said Ravenswood, drily. Balderstone here\nturned to his master a half-upbraiding, half-imploring countenance,\nand edged towards him as he repeated, “It was nae great matter of\npreparation; but just something added to your honour's ordinary course\nof fare--petty cover, as they say at the Louvre--three courses and the\nfruit.”\n\n“Keep your intolerable nonsense to yourself, you old fool!” said\nRavenswood, mortified at his officiousness, yet not knowing how to\ncontradict him, without the risk of giving rise to scenes yet more\nridiculous.\n\nCaleb saw his advantage, and resolved to improve it. But first,\nobserving that the Lord Keeper's servant entered the apartment and spoke\napart with his master, he took the same opportunity to whisper a few\nwords into Ravenswood's ear: “Haud your tongue, for heaven's sake, sir;\nif it's my pleasure to hazard my soul in telling lees for the honour\nof the family, it's nae business o' yours; and if ye let me gang on\nquietly, I'se be moderate in my banquet; but if ye contradict me, deil\nbut I dress ye a dinner fit for a duke!”\n\nRavenswood, in fact, thought it would be best to let his officious\nbutler run on, who proceeded to enumerate upon his fingers--“No muckle\nprovision--might hae served four persons of honour,--first course,\ncapons in white broth--roast kid--bacon with reverence; second course,\nroasted leveret--butter crabs--a veal florentine; third course,\nblackcock--it's black eneugh now wi' the sute--plumdamas--a tart--a\nflam--and some nonsense sweet things, adn comfits--and that's a',”\n he said, seeing the impatience of his master--“that's just a' was\no't--forbye the apples and pears.”\n\nMiss Ashton had by degrees gathered her spirits, so far as to pay some\nattention to what was going on; and observing the restrained impatience\nof Ravenswood, contrasted with the peculiar determination of manner with\nwhich Caleb detailed his imaginary banquet, the whole struck her as so\nridiculous that, despite every effort to the contrary, she burst into a\nfit of incontrollable laughter, in which she was joined by her father,\nthough with more moderation, and finally by the Master of Ravenswood\nhimself, though conscious that the jest was at his own expense. Their\nmirth--for a scene which we read with little emotion often appears\nextremely ludicrous to the spectators--made the old vault ring again.\nThey ceased--they renewed--they ceased--they renewed again their shouts\nof laughter! Caleb, in the mean time, stood his ground with a grave,\nangry, and scornful dignity, which greatly enhanced the ridicule of the\nscene and mirth of the spectators.\n\nAt length, when the voices, and nearly the strength, of the laughers\nwere exhausted, he exclaimed, with very little ceremony: “The deil's in\nthe gentles! they breakfast sae lordly, that the loss of the best dinner\never cook pat fingers to makes them as merry as if it were the best\njeest in a' George Buchanan. If there was as little in your honours'\nwames as there is in Caleb Balderstone's, less caickling wad serve ye on\nsic a gravaminous subject.”\n\nCaleb's blunt expression of resentment again awakened the mirth of the\ncompany, which, by the way, he regarded not only as an aggression upon\nthe dignity of the family, but a special contempt of the eloquence with\nwhich he himself had summed up the extent of their supposed losses. “A\ndescription of a dinner,” as he said afterwards to Mysie, “that wad hae\nmade a fu' man hungry, and them to sit there laughing at it!”\n\n“But,” said Miss Ashton, composing her countenance as well as she could,\n“are all these delicacies so totally destroyed that no scrap can be\ncollected?”\n\n“Collected, my leddy! what wad ye collect out of the sute and the ass?\nYe may gang down yoursell, and look into our kitchen--the cookmaid in\nthe trembling exies--the gude vivers lying a' about--beef, capons, and\nwhite broth--florentine and flams--bacon wi' reverence--and a' the sweet\nconfections and whim-whams--ye'll see them a', my leddy--that is,” said\nhe, correcting himself, “ye'll no see ony of them now, for the cook\nhas soopit them up, as was weel her part; but ye'll see the white broth\nwhere it was spilt. I pat my fingers in it, and it tastes as like sour\nmilk as ony thing else; if that isna the effect of thunner, I kenna what\nis. This gentleman here couldna but hear the clash of our haill dishes,\nchina and silver thegither?”\n\nThe Lord Keeper's domestic, though a statesman's attendant, and of\ncourse trained to command his countenance upon all occasions, was\nsomewhat discomposed by this appeal, to which he only answered by a bow.\n\n“I think, Mr. Butler,” said the Lord Keeper, who began to be afraid lest\nthe prolongation of this scene should at length displease Ravenswood--“I\nthink that, were you to retire with my servant Lockhard--he has\ntravelled, and is quite accustomed to accidents and contingencies of\nevery kind, and I hope betwixt you, you may find out some mode of supply\nat this emergency.”\n\n“His honour kens,” said Caleb, who, however hopeless of himself\nof accomplishing what was desirable, would, like the high-spirited\nelephant, rather have died in the effort than brooked the aid of a\nbrother in commission--“his honour kens weel I need nae counsellor, when\nthe honour of the house is concerned.”\n\n“I should be unjust if I denied it, Caleb,” said his master; “but your\nart lies chiefly in making apologies, upon which we can no more dine\nthan upon the bill of fare of our thunder-blasted dinner. Now, possibly\nMr. Lockhard's talent may consist in finding some substitute for that\nwhich certainly is not, and has in all probability never been.”\n\n“Your honour is pleased to be facetious,” said Caleb, “but I am sure\nthat, for the warst, for a walk as far as Wolf's Hope, I could dine\nforty men--no that the folk there deserve your honour's custom. They hae\nbeen ill advised in the matter of the duty eggs and butter, I winna deny\nthat.”\n\n“Do go consult together,” said the Master; “go down to the village,\nand do the best you can. We must not let our guests remain without\nrefreshment, to save the honour of a ruined family. And here, Caleb,\ntake my purse; I believe that will prove your best ally.”\n\n“Purse! purse, indeed!” quoth Caleb, indignantly flinging out of the\nroom; “what suld I do wi' your honour's purse, on your ain grund? I\ntrust we are no to pay for our ain?”\n\nThe servants left the hall; and the door was no sooner shut than the\nLord Keeper began to apologise for the rudeness of his mirth; and Lucy\nto hope she had given no pain or offence to the kind-hearted faithful\nold man.\n\n“Caleb and I must both learn, madam, to undergo with good humour, or at\nleast with patience, the ridicule which everywhere attaches itself to\npoverty.”\n\n“You do yourself injustice, Master of Ravenswood, on my word of honour,”\n answered his elder guest. “I believe I know more of your affairs than\nyou do yourself, and I hope to show you that I am interested in them;\nand that--in short, that your prospects are better than you apprehend.\nIn the mean time, I can conceive nothing so respectable as the spirit\nwhich rises above misfortune, and prefers honourable privations to debt\nor dependence.”\n\nWhether from fear of offending the delicacy or awakening the pride of\nthe Master, the Lord Keeper made these allusions with an appearance\nof fearful and hesitating reserve, and seemed to be afraid that he was\nintruding too far, in venturing to touch, however lightly, upon such a\ntopic, even when the Master had led to it. In short, he appeared at once\npushed on by his desire of appearing friendly, and held back by the fear\nof intrusion. It was no wonder that the Master of Ravenswood, little\nacquainted as he then was with life, should have given this consummate\ncourtier credit for more sincerity than was probably to be found in\na score of his cast. He answered, however, with reserve, that he was\nindebted to all who might think well of him; and, apologising to his\nguests, he left the hall, in order to make such arrangements for their\nentertainment as circumstances admitted.\n\nUpon consulting with old Mysie, the accommodations for the night were\neasily completed, as indeed they admitted of little choice. The Master\nsurrendered his apartment for the use of Miss Ashton, and Mysie, once a\nperson of consequence, dressed in a black satin gown which had belonged\nof yore to the Master's grandmother, and had figured in the court-balls\nof Henrietta Maria, went to attend her as lady's-maid. He next inquired\nafter Bucklaw, and understanding he was at the change-house with the\nhuntsmen and some companions, he desired Caleb to call there, and\nacquaint him how he was circumstanced at Wolf's Crag; to intimate to him\nthat it would be most convenient if he could find a bed in the hamlet,\nas the elder guest must necessarily be quartered in the secret chamber,\nthe only spare bedroom which could be made fit to receive him. The\nMaster saw no hardship in passing the night by the hall fire, wrapt in\nhis campaign-cloak; and to Scottish domestics of the day, even of the\nhighest rank, nay, to young men of family or fashion, on any pinch,\nclean straw, or a dry hayloft, was always held good night-quarters.\n\nFor the rest, Lockhard had his master's orders to bring some venison\nfrom the inn, and Caleb was to trust to his wits for the honour of his\nfamily. The Master, indeed, a second time held out his purse; but, as it\nwas in sight of the strange servant, the butler thought himself obliged\nto decline what his fingers itched to clutch. “Couldna he hae slippit it\ngently into my hand?” said Caleb; “but his honour will never learn how\nto bear himsell in siccan cases.”\n\nMysie, in the mean time, according to a uniform custom in remote places\nin Scotland, offered the strangers the produce of her little dairy,\n“while better meat was getting ready.” And according to another custom,\nnot yet wholly in desuetude, as the storm was now drifting off to\nleeward, the Master carried the Keeper to the top of his highest\ntower to admire a wide and waste extent of view, and to “weary for his\ndinner.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n     “Now dame,” quoth he, “Je vous dis sans doute,\n     Had I nought of a capon but the liver,\n     And of your white bread nought but a shiver,\n     And after that a roasted pigge's head\n     (But I ne wold for me no beast were dead),\n     Then had I with you homely sufferaunce.”\n\n     CHAUCER, Summer's Tale.\n\nIT was not without some secret misgivings that Caleb set out upon\nhis exploratory expedition. In fact, it was attended with a treble\ndifficulty. He dared not tell his mast the offence which he had that\nmorning given to Bucklaw, just for the honour of the family; he dared\nnot acknowledge he had been too hasty in refusing the purse; and,\nthirdly, he was somewhat apprehensive of unpleasant consequences upon\nhis meeting Hayston under the impression of an affront, and probably by\nthis time under the influence also of no small quantity of brandy.\n\nCaleb, to do him justice, was as bold as any lion where the honour of\nthe family of Ravenswood was concerned; but his was that considerate\nvalour which does not delight in unnecessary risks. This, however, was a\nsecondary consideration; the main point was to veil the indigence of\nthe housekeeping at the castle, and to make good his vaunt of the cheer\nwhich his resources could procure, without Lockhard's assistance, and\nwithout supplies from his master. This was as prime a point of honour\nwith him as with the generous elephant with whom we have already\ncompared him, who, being overtasked, broke his skull through the\ndesperate exertions which he made to discharge his duty, when he\nperceived they were bringing up another to his assistance.\n\nThe village which they now approached had frequently afforded the\ndistressed butler resources upon similar emergencies; but his relations\nwith it had been of late much altered.\n\nIt was a little hamlet which straggled along the side of a creek formed\nby the discharge of a small brook into the sea, and was hidden from\nthe castle, to which it had been in former times an appendage, by the\nintervention of the shoulder of a hill forming a projecting headland.\nIt was called Wolf's Hope (i.e. Wolf's Haven), and the few inhabitants\ngained a precarious subsistence by manning two or three fishing-boats\nin the herring season, and smuggling gin and brandy during the\nwinter months. They paid a kind of hereditary respect to the Lords\nof Ravenswood; but, in the difficulties of the family, most of the\ninhabitants of Wolf's Hope had contrived to get feu-rights to their\nlittle possessions, their huts, kail-yards, and rights of commonty, so\nthat they were emancipated from the chains of feudal dependence,\nand free from the various exactions with which, under every possible\npretext, or without any pretext at all, the Scottish landlords of the\nperiod, themselves in great poverty, were wont to harass their still\npoorer tenants at will. They might be, on the whole, termed independent,\na circumstance peculiarly galling to Caleb, who had been wont to\nexercise over them the same sweeping authority in levying contributions\nwhich was exercised in former times in England, when “the royal\npurveyors, sallying forth from under the Gothic portcullis to purchase\nprovisions with power and prerogative, instead of money, brought home\nthe plunder of an hundred markets, and all that could be seized from\na flying and hiding country, and deposited their spoil in an hundred\ncaverns.”\n\nCaleb loved the memory and resented the downfall of that authority,\nwhich mimicked, on a petty scale, the grand contributions exacted by\nthe feudal sovereigns. And as he fondly flattered himself that the awful\nrule and right supremacy, which assigned to the Barons of Ravenswood the\nfirst and most effective interest in all productions of nature within\nfive miles of their castle, only slumbered, and was not departed\nfor ever, he used every now and then to give the recollection of the\ninhabitants a little jog by some petty exaction. These were at first\nsubmitted to, with more or less readiness, by the inhabitants of the\nhamlet; for they had been so long used to consider the wants of the\nBaron and his family as having a title to be preferred to their own,\nthat their actual independence did not convey to them an immediate sense\nof freedom. They resembled a man that has been long fettered, who,\neven at liberty, feels in imagination the grasp of the handcuffs still\nbinding his wrists. But the exercise of freedom is quickly followed with\nthe natural consciousness of its immunities, as the enlarged prisoner,\nby the free use of his limbs, soon dispels the cramped feeling they had\nacquired when bound.\n\nThe inhabitants of Wolf's Hope began to grumble, to resist, and at\nlength positively to refuse compliance with the exactions of Caleb\nBalderstone. It was in vain he reminded them, that when the eleventh\nLord Ravenswood, called the Skipper, from his delight in naval matters,\nhad encouraged the trade of their port by building the pier (a bulwark\nof stones rudely piled together), which protected the fishing-boats from\nthe weather, it had been matter of understanding that he was to have\nthe first stone of butter after the calving of every cow within the\nbarony, and the first egg, thence called the Monday's egg, laid by every\nhen on every Monday in the year.\n\nThe feuars heard and scratched their heads, coughed, sneezed, and being\npressed for answer, rejoined with one voice, “They could not say”--the\nuniversal refuge of a Scottish peasant when pressed to admit a claim\nwhich his conscience owns, or perhaps his feelings, and his interest\ninclines him to deny.\n\nCaleb, however, furnished the notables of Wolf's Hope with a note of\nthe requisition of butter and eggs, which he claimed as arrears of the\naforesaid subsidy, or kindly aid, payable as above mentioned; and having\nintimated that he would not be averse to compound the same for goods or\nmoney, if it was inconvenient to them to pay in kind, left them, as he\nhoped, to debate the mode of assessing themselves for that purpose.\nOn the contrary, they met with a determined purpose of resisting the\nexaction, and were only undecided as to the mode of grounding\ntheir opposition, when the cooper, a very important person on a\nfishing-station, and one of the conscript fathers of the village,\nobserved, “That their hens had caickled mony a day for the Lords of\nRavenswood, and it was time they suld caickle for those that gave\nthem roosts and barley.” An unanimous grin intimated the assent of the\nassembly. “And,” continued the orator, “if it's your wull, I'll just tak\na step as far as Dunse for Davie Dingwall, the writer, that's come frae\nthe North to settle amang us, and he'll pit this job to rights, I'se\nwarrant him.”\n\nA day was accordingly fixed for holding a grand palaver at Wolf's Hope\non the subject of Caleb's requisitions, and he was invited to attend at\nthe hamlet for that purpose.\n\nHe went with open hands and empty stomach, trusting to fill the one on\nhis master's account and the other on his own score, at the expense of\nthe feuars of Wolf's Hope. But, death to his hopes! as he entered the\neastern end of the straggling village, the awful form of Davie Dingwall,\na sly, dry, hard-fisted, shrewd country attorney, who had already acted\nagainst the family of Ravenswood, and was a principal agent of Sir\nWilliam Ashton, trotted in at the western extremity, bestriding a\nleathern portmanteau stuffed with the feu-charters of the hamlet, and\nhoping he had not kept Mr. Balderstone waiting, “as he was instructed\nand fully empowered to pay or receive, compound or compensate, and,\nin fine, to age as accords respecting all mutual and unsettled claims\nwhatsoever, belonging or competent to the Honourable Edgar Ravenswood,\ncommonly called the Master of Ravenswood----”\n\n“The RIGHT Honourable Edgar LORD RAVENSWOOD,” said Caleb, with great\nemphasis; for, though conscious he had little chance of advantage in the\nconflict to ensue, he was resolved not to sacrifice one jot of honour.\n\n“Lord Ravenswood, then,” said the man of business--“we shall not quarrel\nwith you about titles of courtesy--commonly called Lord Ravenswood, or\nMaster of Ravenswood, heritable proprietor of the lands and barony of\nWolf's Crag, on othe ne part, and to John Whitefish and others, feuars\nin the town of Wolf's Hope, within the barony aforesaid, on the other\npart.”\n\nCaleb was conscious, from sad experience, that he would wage a very\ndifferent strife with this mercenary champion than with the individual\nfeuars themselves, upon whose old recollections, predilections,\nand habits of thinking he might have wrought by an hundred indirect\narguments, to which their deputy-representative was totally insensible.\nThe issue of the debate proved the reality of his apprehensions. It was\nin vain he strained his eloquence and ingenuity, and collected into one\nmass all arguments arising from antique custom and hereditary respect,\nfrom the good deeds done by the Lords of Ravenswood to the community of\nWolf's Hope in former days, and from what might be expected from them in\nfuture. The writer stuck to the contents of his feu-charters; he could\nnot see it: 'twas not in the bond. And when Caleb, determined to try\nwhat a little spirit would do, deprecated the consequences of Lord\nRavenswood's withdrawing his protection from the burgh, and even hinted\nin his using active measures of resentment, the man of law sneered in\nhis face.\n\n“His clients,” he said, “had determined to do the best they could for\ntheir own town, and he thought Lord Ravenswood, since he was a lord,\nmight have enough to do to look after his own castle. As to any threats\nof stouthrief oppression, by rule of thumb, or via facti, as the law\ntermed it, he would have Mr. Balderstone recollect, that new times were\nnot as old times; that they lived on the south of the Forth, and far\nfrom the Highlands; that his clients thought they were able to protect\nthemselves; but should they find themselves mistaken, they would apply\nto the government for the protection of a corporal and four red-coats,\nwho,” said Mr. Dingwall, with a grin, “would be perfectly able to secure\nthem against Lord Ravenswood, and all that he or his followers could do\nby the strong hand.”\n\nIf Caleb could have concentrated all the lightnings of aristocracy in\nhis eye, to have struck dead this contemner of allegiance and privilege,\nhe would have launched them at his head, without respect to the\nconsequences. As it was, he was compelled to turn his course backward\nto the castle; and there he remained for full half a day invisible and\ninaccessible even to Mysie, sequestered in his own peculiar dungeon,\nwhere he sat burnishing a single pewter plate and whistling “Maggie\nLauder” six hours without intermission.\n\nThe issue of this unfortunate requisition had shut against Caleb all\nresources which could be derived from Wolf's Hope and its purlieus, the\nEl Dorado, or Peru, from which, in all former cases of exigence, he had\nbeen able to extract some assistance. He had, indeed, in a manner vowed\nthat the deil should have him, if ever he put the print of his foot\nwithin its causeway again. He had hitherto kept his word; and, strange\nto tell, this secession had, as he intended, in some degree, the effect\nof a punishment upon the refractory feuars. Mr. Balderstone had been a\nperson in their eyes connected with a superior order of beings, whose\npresence used to grace their little festivities, whose advice they found\nuseful on many occasions, and whose communications gave a sort of credit\nto their village. The place, they acknowledged, “didna look as it used\nto do, and should do, since Mr. Caleb keepit the castle sae closely;\nbut doubtless, touching the eggs and butter, it was a most unreasonable\ndemand, as Mr. Dingwall had justly made manifest.”\n\nThus stood matters betwixt the parties, when the old butler, though it\nwas gall and wormwood to him, found himself obliged either to ackowledge\nbefore a strange man of quality, and, what was much worse, before that\nstranger's servant, the total inability of Wolf's Crag to produce a\ndinner, or he must trust to the compassion of the feuars of Wofl's Hope.\nIt was a dreadful degradation; but necessity was equally imperious and\nlawless. With these feelings he entered the street of the village.\n\nWilling to shake himself from his companion as soon as possible, he\ndirected Mr. Lockhard to Luckie Sma-trash's change-house, where a din,\nproceeding from the revels of Bucklaw, Craigengelt, and their party,\nsounded half-way down the street, while the red glare from the window\noverpowered the grey twilight which was now settling down, and glimmered\nagainst a parcel of old tubs, kegs, and barrels, piled up in the\ncooper's yard, on the other side of the way.\n\n“If you, Mr. Lockhard,” said the old butler to his companion, “will be\npleased to step to the change-house where that light comes from, and\nwhere, as I judge, they are now singing 'Cauld Kail in Aberdeen,' ye\nmay do your master's errand about the venison, and I will do mine about\nBucklaw's bed, as I return frae getting the rest of the vivers. It's no\nthat the venison is actually needfu',” he added, detaining his colleague\nby the button, “to make up the dinner; but as a compliment to the\nhunters, ye ken; and, Mr. Lockhard, if they offer ye a drink o' yill, or\na cup o' wine, or a glass o' brandy, ye'll be a wise man to take it,\nin case the thunner should hae soured ours at the castle, whilk is ower\nmuckle to be dreaded.”\n\nHe then permitted Lockhard to depart; and with foot heavy as lead, and\nyet far lighter than his heart, stepped on through the unequal street\nof the straggling village, meditating on whom he ought to make his\nfirst attack. It was necessary he should find some one with whom old\nacknowledged greatness should weigh more than recent independence, and\nto whom his application might appear an act of high dignity, relenting\nat once and soothing. But he could not recollect an inhabitant of a mind\nso constructed. “Our kail is like to be cauld eneugh too,” he reflected,\nas the chorus of “Cauld Kail in Aberdeen” again reached his ears. The\nminister--he had got his presentation from the late lord, but they had\nquarrelled about teinds; the brewster's wife--she had trusted long, and\nthe bill was aye scored up, and unless the dignity of the family should\nactually require it, it would be a sin to distress a widow woman.\nNone was so able--but, on the other hand, none was likely to be less\nwilling--to stand his friend upon the present occasion, than Gibbie\nGirder, the man of tubs and barrels already mentioned, who had headed\nthe insurrection in the matter of the egg and butter subsidy. “But\na' comes o' taking folk on the right side, I trow,” quoted Caleb to\nhimself; “and I had ance the ill hap to say he was but a Johnny New-come\nin our town, and the carle bore the family an ill-will ever since.\nBut he married a bonny young quean, Jean Lightbody, auld Lightbody's\ndaughter, him that was in the steading of Loup-the-Dyke; and auld\nLightbody was married himsell to Marion, that was about my lady in\nthe family forty years syne. I hae had mony a day's daffing wi' Jean's\nmither, and they say she bides on wi' them. The carle has Jacobuses and\nGeorgiuses baith, an ane could get at them; and sure I am, it's doing\nhim an honour him or his never deserved at our hand, the ungracious\nsumph; and if he loses by us a'thegither, he is e'en cheap o't: he can\nspare it brawly.” Shaking off irresolution, therefore, and turning at\nonce upon his heel, Caleb walked hastily back to the cooper's house,\nlifted the latch withotu ceremony, and, in a moment, found himself\nbehind the “hallan,” or partition, from which position he could, himself\nunseen, reconnoitre the interior of the “but,” or kitchen apartment, of\nthe mansion.\n\nReverse of the sad menage at the Castle of Wolf's Crag, a bickering\nfire roared up the cooper's chimney. His wife, on the one side, in\nher pearlings and pudding-sleeves, put the last finishing touch to\nher holiday's apparel, while she contemplated a very handsome and\ngood-humoured face in a broken mirror, raised upon the “bink” (the\nshelves on which the plates are disposed) for her special accommodation.\nHer mother, old Luckie Loup-the-Dyke, “a canty carline” as was within\ntwenty miles of her, according to the unanimous report of the “cummers,”\n or gossips, sat by the fire in the full glory of a grogram gown, lammer\nbeads, and a clean cockernony, whiffing a snug pipe of tobacco, and\nsuperintending the affairs of the kitchen; for--sight more interesting\nto the anxious heart and craving entrails of the desponding seneschal\nthan either buxom dame or canty cummer--there bubbled on the aforesaid\nbickering fire a huge pot, or rather cauldron, steaming with beef and\nbrewis; while before it revolved two spits, turned each by one of the\ncooper's apprentices, seated in the opposite corners of the chimney, the\none loaded with a quarter of mutton, while the other was graced with a\nfat goose and a brace of wild ducks. The sight and scent of such a\nland of plenty almost wholly overcame the drooping spirits of Caleb. He\nturned, for a moment's space to reconnoitre the “ben,” or parlour end\nof the house, and there saw a sight scarce less affecting to his\nfeelings--a large round table, covered for ten or twelve persons,\ndecored (according to his own favourite terms) with napery as white as\nsnow, grand flagons of pewter, intermixed with one or two silver cups,\ncontaining, as was probable, something worthy the brilliancy of their\noutward appearance, clean trenchers, cutty spoons, knives and forks,\nsharp, burnished, and prompt for action, which lay all displayed as for\nan especial festival.\n\n“The devil's in the peddling tub-coopering carl!” muttered Caleb, in all\nthe envy of astonishment; “it's a shame to see the like o' them gusting\ntheir gabs at sic a rate. But if some o' that gude cheer does not find\nits way to Wolf's Crag this night, my name is not Caleb Balderstone.”\n\nSo resolving, he entered the apartment, and, in all courteous greeting,\nsaluted both the mother and the daughter. Wolf's Crag was the court of\nthe barony, Caleb prime minister at Wolf's Crag; and it has ever been\nremarked that, though the masculine subject who pays the taxes sometimes\ngrowls at the courtiers by whom they are imposed, the said courtiers\ncontinue, nevertheless, welcome to the fair sex, to whom they furnish\nthe newest small-talk and the earliest fashions. Both the dames were,\ntherefore, at once about old Caleb's neck, setting up their throats\ntogether by way of welcome.\n\n“Ay, sirs, Mr. Balderstone, and is this you? A sight of you is gude for\nsair een. Sit down--sit down; the gudeman will be blythe to see you--ye\nnar saw him sae cadgy in your life; but we are to christen our bit wean\nthe night, as ye will hae heard, and doubtless ye will stay and see the\nordinance. We hae killed a wether, and ane o' our lads has been out wi'\nhis gun at the moss; ye used to like wild-fowl.”\n\n“Na, na, gudewife,” said Caleb; “I just keekit in to wish ye joy, and I\nwad be glad to hae spoken wi' the gudeman, but----” moving, as if to go\naway.\n\n“The ne'er a fit ye's gang,” said the elder dame, laughing and holding\nhim fast, with a freedom which belonged to their old acquaintance;\n“wha kens what ill it may bring to the bairn, if ye owerlook it in that\ngate?”\n\n“But I'm in a preceese hurry, gudewife,” said the butler, suffering\nhimself to be dragged to a seat without much resistance; “and as to\neating,” for he observed the mistress of the dwelling bustling about to\nplace a trencher for him--“as for eating--lack-a-day, we are just killed\nup yonder wi' eating frae morning to night! It's shamefu' epicurism; but\nthat's what we hae gotten frae the English pock-puddings.” “Hout,\nnever mind the English pock-puddings,” said Luckie Lightbody; “try our\npuddings, Mr. Balderstone; there is black pudding and white-hass; try\nwhilk ye like best.”\n\n“Baith gude--baith excellent--canna be better; but the very smell is\neneugh for me that hae dined sae lately (the faithful wretch had fasted\nsince daybreak). But I wadna affront your housewifeskep, gudewife; and,\nwith your permission, I'se e'en pit them in my napkin, and eat them to\nmy supper at e'en, for I am wearied of Mysie's pastry and nonsense; ye\nken landward dainties aye pleased me best, Marion, and landward lasses\ntoo (looking at the cooper's wife). Ne'er a bit but she looks far better\nthan when she married Gilbert, and then she was the bonniest lass in our\nparochine and the neist till't. But gawsie cow, goodly calf.”\n\nThe women smiled at the compliment each to herself, and they smiled\nagain to each other as Caleb wrapt up the puddings in a towel which he\nhad brought with him, as a dragoon carries his foraging bag to receive\nwhat my fall in his way.\n\n“And what news at the castle?” quo' the gudewife.\n\n“News! The bravest news ye ever heard--the Lord Keeper's up yonder wi'\nhis fair daughter, just ready to fling her at my lord's head, if he\nwinna tak her out o' his arms; and I'se warrant he'll stitch our auld\nlands of Ravenswood to her petticoat tail.”\n\n“Eh! sirs--ay!--and will hae her? and is she weel-favoured? and what's\nthe colour o' her hair? and does she wear a habit or a railly?” were the\nquestions which the females showered upon the butler.\n\n“Hout tout! it wad tak a man a day to answer a' your questions, and I\nhae hardly a minute. Where's the gudeman?”\n\n“Awa' to fetch the minister,” said Mrs. Girder, “precious Mr. Peter\nBide-the-Bent, frae the Mosshead; the honest man has the rheumatism wi'\nlying in the hills in the persecution.”\n\n“Ay! Whig and a mountain-man, nae less!” said Caleb, with a peevishness\nhe could not suppress. “I hae seen the day, Luckie, when worthy Mr.\nCuffcushion and the service-book would hae served your turn (to the\nelder dame), or ony honest woman in like circumstances.”\n\n“And that's true too,” said Mrs. Lightbody, “but what can a body do?\nJean maun baith sing her psalms and busk her cockernony the gate the\ngudeman likes, and nae ither gate; for he's maister and mair at hame, I\ncan tell ye, Mr. Balderstone.”\n\n“Ay, ay, and does he guide the gear too?” said Caleb, to whose projects\nmasculine rule boded little good. “Ilka penny on't; but he'll dress her\nas dink as a daisy, as ye see; sae she has little reason to complain:\nwhere there's ane better aff there's ten waur.”\n\n“Aweel, gudewife,” said Caleb, crestfallen, but not beaten off, “that\nwasna the way ye guided your gudeman; bt ilka land has its ain lauch.\nI maun be ganging. I just wanted to round in the gudeman's lug, that I\nheard them say up-bye yonder that Peter Puncheon, that was cooper to the\nQueen's stores at the Timmer Burse at Leith, is dead; sae I though that\nmaybe a word frae my lord to the Lord Keeper might hae served Gilbert;\nbut since he's frae hame----”\n\n“O, but ye maun stay his hame-coming,” said the dame. “I aye telled\nthe gudeman ye meant weel to him; but he taks the tout at every bit\nlippening word.”\n\n“Aweel, I'll stay the last minute I can.”\n\n“And so,” said the handsome young spouse of Mr. Girder, “ye think this\nMiss Ashton is weel-favoured? Troth, and sae should she, to set up for\nour young lord, with a face and a hand, and a seat on his horse, that\nmight become a king's son. D'ye ken that he aye glowers up at my window,\nMr. Balderstone, when he chaunces to ride thro' the town? Sae I hae a\nright to ken what like he is, as weel as ony body.”\n\n“I ken that brawly,” said Caleb, “for I hae heard his lordship say the\ncooper's wife had the blackest ee in the barony; and I said, 'Weel may\nthat be, my lord, for it was her mither's afore her, as I ken to my\ncost.' Eh, Marion? Ha, ha, ha! Ah! these were merry days!”\n\n“Hout awa', auld carle,” said the old dame, “to speak sic daffing to\nyoung folk. But, Jean--fie, woman, dinna ye hear the bairn greet? I'se\nwarrant it's that dreary weid has come ower't again.”\n\nUp got mother and grandmother, and scoured away, jostling each other as\nthey ran, into some remote corner of the tenement, where the young hero\nof the evening was deposited. When Caleb saw the coast fairly clear,\nhe took an invigorating pinch of snuff, to sharpen and confirm his\nresolution.\n\n“Cauld be my cast,” thought he, “if either Bide-the-Bent or Girder taste\nthat broach of wild-fowl this evening”; and then addressing the eldest\nturnspit, a boy of about eleven years old, and putting a penny into his\nhand, he said, “Here is twal pennies, my man; carry that ower to Mrs.\nSma'trash, and bid her fill my mill wi' snishing, and I'll turn the\nbroche for ye in the mean time; and she will gie ye a ginge-bread snap\nfor your pains.”\n\nNo sooner was the elder boy departed on this mission than Caleb, looking\nthe remaining turnspit gravely and steadily in the face, removed from\nthe fire the spit bearing the wild-fowl of which he had undertaken the\ncharge, clapped his hat on his head, and fairly marched off with it,\nhe stopped at the door of the change-house only to say, in a few brief\nwords, that Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw was not to expect a bed that evening\nin the castle.\n\nIf this message was too briefly delivered by Caleb, it became absolute\nrudeness when conveyed through the medium of a suburb landlady; and\nBucklaw was, as a more calm and temperate man might have been, highly\nincensed. Captain Craigengelt proposed, with the unanimous applause of\nall present, that they should course the old fox (meaning Caleb) ere he\ngot to cover, and toss him in a blanket. But Lockhard intimated to\nhis master's servants and those of Lord Bittlebrains, in a tone of\nauthority, that the slightest impertinence to the Master of Ravenswood's\ndomestic would give Sir William Ashton the highest offence. And having\nso said, in a manner sufficient to prevent any aggression on their part,\nhe left the public-house, taking along with him two servants loaded with\nsuch provisions as he had been able to procure, and overtook Caleb just\nwhen he had cleared the village.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n     Should I take aught of you? 'Tis true I begged now;\n     And what is worse than that, I stole a kindness;\n     And, what is worst of all, I lost my way in't.\n\n     Wit Without Money.\n\nTHE face of the little boy, sole witness of Caleb's infringement upon\nthe laws at once of property and hospitality, would have made a good\npicture. He sat motionless, as if he had witnessed some of the spectral\nappearances which he had heard told of in a winter's evening; and as he\nforgot his own duty, and allowed his spit to stand still, he added to\nthe misfortunes of the evening by suffering the mutton to burn as black\nas a coal. He was first recalled from his trance of astonishment by\na hearty cuff administered by Dame Lightbody, who, in whatever other\nrespects she might conform to her name, was a woman strong of person,\nand expert in the use of her hands, as some say her deceased husband had\nknown to his cost.\n\n“What garr'd ye let the roast burn, ye ill-clerkit gude-for-nought?”\n\n“I dinna ken,” said the boy.\n\n“And where's that ill-deedy gett, Giles?”\n\n“I dinna ken,” blubbered the astonished declarant.\n\n“And where's Mr. Balderstone?--and abune a', and in the name of council\nand kirk-session, that I suld say sae, where's the broche wi' the\nwild-fowl?” As Mrs. Girder here entered, and joined her mother's\nexclamations, screaming into one ear while the old lady deafened the\nother, they succeeded in so utterly confounding the unhappy urchin, that\nhe could not for some time tell his story at all, and it was only when\nthe elder boy returned that the truth began to dawn on their minds.\n\n“Weel, sirs!” said Mrs. Lightbody, “wha wad hae thought o' Caleb\nBalderstone playing an auld acquaintance sic a pliskie!”\n\n“Oh, weary on him!” said the spouse of Mr. Girder; “and what am I to\nsay to the gudeman? He'll brain me, if there wasna anither woman in a'\nWolf's Hope.”\n\n“Hout tout, silly quean,” said the mother; “na, na, it's come to muckle,\nbut it's no come to that neither; for an he brain you he maun brain me,\nand I have garr'd his betters stand back. Hands aff is fair play; we\nmaunna heed a bit flyting.”\n\nThe tramp of horses now announced the arrival of the cooper, with the\nminister. They had no sooner dismounted than they made for the kitchen\nfire, for the evening was cool after the thunderstorm, and the woods wet\nand dirty. The young gudewife, strong in the charms of her Sunday gown\nand biggonets, threw herself in the way of receiving the first attack,\nwhile her mother, like the veteran division of the Roman legion,\nremained in the rear, ready to support her in case of necessity. Both\nhoped to protract the discovery of what had happened--the mother, by\ninterposing her bustling person betwixt Mr. Girder and the fire, and the\ndaughter, by the extreme cordiality with which she received the minister\nand her husband, and the anxious fears which she expressed lest they\nshould have “gotten cauld.” “Cauld!” quoted the husband, surlily, for he\nwas not of that class of lords and masters whose wives are viceroys\nover them, “we'll be cauld eneugh, I think, if ye dinna let us in to the\nfire.”\n\nAnd so saying, he burst his way through both lines of defence; and, as\nhe had a careful eye over his property of every kind, he perceived at\none glance the absence of the spit with its savoury burden. “What the\ndeil, woman----”\n\n“Fie for shame!” exclaimed both the women; “and before Mr.\nBide-the-Bent!”\n\n“I stand reproved,” said the cooper; “but--”\n\n“The taking in our mouths the name of the great enemy of our souls,”\n said Mr. Bide-the-Bent--\n\n“I stand reproved,” said the cooper.\n\n“--Is an exposing ourselves to his temptations,” continued the reverend\nmonitor, “and in inviting, or, in some sort, a compelling, of him to lay\naside his other trafficking with unhappy persons, and wait upon those in\nwhose speech his name is frequent.”\n\n“Weel, weel, Mr. Bide-the-Bent, can a man do mair than stand reproved?”\n said the cooper; “but jest let me ask the women what for they hae dished\nthe wild-fowl before we came.”\n\n“They arena dished, Gilbert,” said his wife; “but--but an accident----”\n\n“What accident?” said Girder, with flashing eyes. “Nae ill come ower\nthem, I trust? Uh?”\n\nHis wife, who stood much in awe of him, durst not reply, but her mother\nbustled up to her support, with arms disposed as if they were about to\nbe a-kimbo at the next reply.--“I gied them to an acquaintance of mine,\nGibbie Girder; and what about it now?”\n\nHer excess of assurance struck Girder mute for an instant. “And YE gied\nthe wild-fowl, the best end of our christening dinner, to a friend of\nyours, ye auld rudas! And what might HIS name be, I pray ye?”\n\n“Just worthy Mr. Caleb Balderstone--frae Wolf's Crag,” answered Marion,\nprompt and prepared for battle.\n\nGirder's wrath foamed over all restraint. If there was a circumstance\nwhich could have added to the resentment he felt, it was that this\nextravagant donation had been made in favour of our friend Caleb,\ntowards whom, for reasons to which the reader is no stranger, he\nnourished a decided resentment. He raised his riding-wand against the\nelder matron, but she stood firm, collected in herself, and undauntedly\nbrandished the iron ladle with which she had just been “flambing”\n (Anglice, basting) the roast of mutton. Her weapon was certainly the\nbetter, and her arm not the weakest of the two; so that Gilbert thought\nit safest to turn short off upon his wife, who had by this time hatched\na sort of hysterical whine, which greatly moved the minister, who was in\nfact as simple and kind-hearted a creature as ever breathed. “And you,\nye thowless jade, to sit still and see my substance disponed upon to\nan idle, drunken, reprobate, worm-eaten serving-man, just because he\nkittles the lugs o' a silly auld wife wi' useless clavers, and every twa\nwords a lee? I'll gar you as gude----”\n\nHere the minister interposed, both by voice and action, while Dame\nLightbody threw herself in front of her daughter, and flourished her\nladle.\n\n“Am I no to chastise my ain wife?” exclaimed the cooper very\nindignantly.\n\n“Ye may chastise your ain wife if ye like,” answered Dame Lightbody;\n“but ye shall never lay finger on my daughter, and that ye may found\nupon.” “For shame, Mr. Girder!” said the clergyman; “this is what I\nlittle expected to have seen of you, that you suld give rein to your\nsinful passions against your nearest and your dearest, and this night\ntoo, when ye are called to the most solemn duty of a Christian parent;\nand a' for what? For a redundancy of creature-comforts, as worthless as\nthey are unneedful.”\n\n“Worthless!” exclaimed the cooper. “A better guse never walkit on\nstubble; two finer, dentier wild ducks never wat a feather.”\n\n“Be it sae, neighbour,” rejoined the minister; “but see what\nsuperfluities are yet revolving before your fire. I have seen the day\nwhen ten of the bannocks which stand upon that board would have been an\nacceptable dainty to as many men, that were starving on hills and bogs,\nand in caves of the earth, for the Gospel's sake.”\n\n“And that's what vexes me maist of a',” said the cooper, anxious to get\nsome one to sympathise with his not altogether causeless anger; “an the\nquean had gien it to ony suffering sant, or to ony body ava but that\nreaving, lying, oppressing Tory villain, that rade in the wicked troop\nof militia when it was commanded out against the sants at Bothwell Brig\nby the auld tyrant Allan Ravenswood, that is gane to his place, I wad\nthe less hae minded it. But to gie the principal parts o' the feast to\nthe like o' him----!”\n\n“Aweel, Gilbert,” said the minister, “and dinna ye see a high judgment\nin this? The seed of the righteous are not seen begging their bread:\nthink of the son of a powerful oppressor being brought to the pass of\nsupporting his household from your fulness.”\n\n“And, besides,” said the wife, “it wasna for Lord Ravenswood neither,\nan he wad hear but a body speak: it was to help to entertain the Lord\nKeeper, as they ca' him, that's up yonder at Wolf's Crag.”\n\n“Sir William Ashton at Wolf's Crag!” ejaculated the astonished man of\nhoops and staves.\n\n“And hand and glove wi' Lord Ravenswood,” added Dame Lightbody.\n\n“Doited idiot! that auld, clavering sneckdrawer wad gar ye trow the moon\nis made of green cheese. The Lord Keeper and Ravenswood! they are cat\nand dog, hare and hound.”\n\n“I tell ye they are man and wife, and gree better than some others that\nare sae,” retorted the mother-in-law; “forbye, Peter Puncheon, that's\ncooper the Queen's stores, is dead, and the place is to fill, and----”\n\n“Od guide us, wull ye haud your skirling tongues!” said Girder,--for\nwe are to remark, that this explanation was given like a catch for two\nvoices, the younger dame, much encouraged by the turn of the debate,\ntaking up and repeating in a higher tone the words as fast as they were\nuttered by her mother.\n\n“The gudewife says naething but what's true, maister,” said Girder's\nforeman, who had come in during the fray. “I saw the Lord Keeper's\nservants drinking and driving ower at Luckie Sma'trash's, ower-bye\nyonder.”\n\n“And is their maister up at Wolf's Crag?” said Girder.\n\n“Ay, troth is he,” replied his man of confidence.\n\n“And friends wi' Ravenswood?”\n\n“It's like sae,” answered the foreman, “since he is putting up wi' him.”\n\n“And Peter Puncheon's dead?”\n\n“Ay, ay, Puncheon has leaked out at last, the auld carle,” said the\nforeman; “mony a dribble o' brandy has gaen through him in his day. But\nas for the broche and the wild-fowl, the saddle's no aff your mare yet,\nmaister, and I could follow and bring it back, for Mr. Balderstone's no\nfar aff the town yet.”\n\n“Do sae, Will; and come here, I'll tell ye what to do when ye owertake\nhim.”\n\nHe relieved the females of his presence, and gave Will his private\ninstructions.\n\n“A bonny-like thing,” said the mother-in-law, as the cooper re-entered\nthe apartment, “to send the innocent lad after an armed man, when ye ken\nMr. Balderstone aye wears a rapier, and whiles a dirk into the bargain.”\n\n“I trust,” said the minister, “ye have reflected weel on what ye have\ndone, lest you should minister cause of strife, of which it is my duty\nto say, he who affordeth matter, albeit he himself striketh not, is in\nno manner guiltless.”\n\n“Never fash your beard, Mr. Bide-the-Bent,” replied Girder; “ane canna\nget their breath out here between wives and ministers. I ken best how to\nturn my ain cake. Jean, serve up the dinner, and nae mair about it.”\n\nNor did he again allude to the deficiency in the course of the evening.\n\nMeantime, the foreman, mounted on his master's steed, and charged with\nhis special orders, pricked swiftly forth in pursuit of the marauder\nCaleb. That personage, it may be imagined, did not linger by the way. He\nintermitted even his dearly-beloved chatter, for the purpose of making\nmore haste, only assuring Mr. Lockhard that he had made the purveyor's\nwife give the wild-fowl a few turns before the fire, in case that\nMysie, who had been so much alarmed by the thunder, should not have her\nkitchen-grate in full splendour. Meanwhile, alleging the necessity of\nbeing at Wolf's Crag as soon as possible, he pushed on so fast that his\ncompanions could scarce keep up with him. He began already to think he\nwas safe from pursuit, having gained the summit of the swelling eminence\nwhich divides Wolf's Crag from the village, when he heard the distant\ntread of a horse, and a voice which shouted at intervals, “Mr.\nCaleb--Mr. Balderstone--Mr. Caleb Balderstone--hollo--bide a wee!”\n\nCaleb, it may be well believed, was in no hurry to acknowledge the\nsummons. First, he would not heart it, and faced his companions down,\nthat it was the echo of the wind; then he said it was not worth stopping\nfor; and, at length, halting reluctantly, as the figure of the horseman\nappeared through the shades of the evening, he bent up his whole soul\nto the task of defending his prey, threw himself into an attitude of\ndignity, advanced the spit, which is his grasp might with its burden\nseem both spear and shield, and firmly resolved to die rather than\nsurrender it.\n\nWhat was his astonishment, when the cooper's foreman, riding up and\naddressing him with respect, told him: “His master was very sorry he was\nabsent when he came to his dwelling, and grieved that he could not tarry\nthe christening dinner; and that he had taen the freedom to send a sma'\nrunlet of sack, and ane anker of brandy, as he understood there were\nguests at the castle, and that they were short of preparation.”\n\nI have heard somewhere a story of an elderly gentleman who was pursued\nby a bear that had gotten loose from its muzzle, until completely\nexhausted. In a fit of desperation, he faced round upon Bruin and lifted\nhis cane; at the sight of which the instinct of discipline prevailed,\nand the animal, instead of tearing him to pieces, rose up upon his\nhind-legs and instantly began to shuffle a saraband. Not less than the\njoyful surprise of the senior, who had supposed himself in the extremity\nof peril from which he was thus unexpectedly relieved, was that of our\nexcellent friend Caleb, when he found the pursuer intended to add to\nhis prize, instead of bereaving him of it. He recovered his latitude,\nhowever, instantly, so soon as the foreman, stooping from his nag, where\nhe sate perched betwixt the two barrels, whispered in his ear: “If\nony thing about Peter Puncheon's place could be airted their way, John\n[Gibbie] Girder wad mak it better to the Master of Ravenswood than\na pair of new gloves; and that he wad be blythe to speak wi' Maister\nBalderstone on that head, and he wad find him as pliant as a hoop-willow\nin a' that he could wish of him.”\n\nCaleb heard all this without rendering any answer, except that of all\ngreat men from Louis XIV. downwards, namely, “We will see about it”; and\nthen added aloud, for the edification of Mr. Lockhard: “Your master has\nacted with becoming civility and attention in forwarding the liquors,\nand I will not fail to represent it properly to my Lord Ravenswood. And,\nmy lad,” he said, “you may ride on to the castle, and if none of the\nservants are returned, whilk is to be dreaded, as they make day and\nnight of it when they are out of sight, ye may put them into the\nporter's lodge, whilk is on the right hand of the great entry; the\nporter has got leave to go to see his friends, sae ye will met no ane to\nsteer ye.”\n\nThe foreman, having received his orders, rode on; and having deposited\nthe casks in the deserted and ruinous porter's lodge, he returned\nunquestioned by any one. Having thus executed his master's commission,\nand doffed his bonnet to Caleb and his company as he repassed them in\nhis way to the village, he returned to have his share of the christening\nfestivity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n     As, to the Autumn breeze's bugle sound,\n     Various and vague the dry leaves dance their round;\n     Or, from the garner-door, on ether borne,\n     The chaff flies devious from the winnow'd corn;\n     So vague, so devious, at the breath of heaven,\n     From their fix'd aim are mortal counsels driv'n.\n\n     Anonymous.\n\nWE left Caleb Balderstone in the extremity of triumph at the success of\nhis various achievements for the honour of the house of Ravenswood. When\nhe had mustered and marshalled his dishes of divers kinds, a more royal\nprovision had not been seen in Wolf's Crag since the funeral feast\nof its deceased lord. Great was the glory of the serving-man, as he\n“decored” the old oaken table with a clean cloth, and arranged upon it\ncarbonaded venison and roasted wild-fowl, with a glance, every now and\nthen, as if to upbraid the incredulity of his master and his guests; and\nwith many a story, more or less true, was Lockhard that evening regaled\nconcerning the ancient grandeur of Wolf's Crag, and the sway of its\nbarons over the country in their neighbourhood.\n\n“A vassal scarce held a calf or a lamb his ain, till he had first\nasked if the Lord of Ravenswood was pleased to accept it; and they were\nobliged to ask the lord's consent before they married in these days,\nand mony a merry tale they tell about that right as weel as others. And\nalthough,” said Caleb, “these times are not like the gude auld times,\nwhen authority had its right, yet true it is, Mr. Lockhard, and you\nyoursell may partly have remarked, that we of the house of Ravenswood\ndo our endeavour in keeping up, by all just and lawful exertion of our\nbaronial authority, that due and fitting connexion betwixt superior and\nvassal, whilk is in some danger of falling into desuetude, owing to the\ngeneral license and misrule of these present unhappy times.”\n\n“Umph!” said Mr. Lockhard; “and if I may inquire, Mr. Balderstone, pray\ndo you find your people at the village yonder amenable? for I must needs\nsay, that at Ravenswood Castle, now pertaining to my master the Lord\nKeeper, ye have not left behind ye the most compliant set of tenantry.”\n\n“Ah! but Mr. Lockhard,” replied Caleb, “ye must consider there has been\na change of hands, and the auld lord might expect twa turns frae them,\nwhen the new-comer canna get ane. A dour and fractious set they were,\nthae tenants of Ravenswood, and ill to live wi' when they dinna ken\ntheir master; and if your master put them mad ance, the whole country\nwill not put them down.”\n\n“Troth,” said Mr. Lockhard, “an such be the case, I think the wisest\nthing for us a' wad be to hammer up a match between your young lord and\nour winsome young leddy up-bye there; and Sir William might just stitch\nyour auld barony to her gown-sleeve, and he wad sune cuitle another out\no' somebody else, sic a lang head as he has.”\n\nCaleb shook his head. “I wish,” he said--“I wish that may answer, Mr.\nLockhard. There are auld prophecies about this house I wad like ill to\nsee fulfilled wi' my auld een, that has seen evil eneugh already.”\n\n“Pshaw! never mind freits,” said his brother butler; “if the young folk\nliked ane anither, they wad make a winsome couple. But, to say truth,\nthere is a leddy sits in our hall-neuk, maun have her hand in that as\nweel as in every other job. But there's no harm in drinking to their\nhealths, and I will fill Mrs. Mysie a cup of Mr. Girder's canary.”\n\n\nWhile they thus enjoyed themselves in the kitchen, the company in\nthe hall were not less pleasantly engaged. So soon as Ravenswood had\ndetermined upon giving the Lord Keeper such hospitality as he had to\noffer, he deemed it incumbent on him to assume the open and courteous\nbrow of a well-pleased host. It has been often remarked, that when a man\ncommences by acting a character, he frequently ends by adopting it in\ngood earnest. In the course of an hour or two, Ravenswood, to his own\nsurprise, found himself in the situation of one who frankly does his\nbest to entertain welcome and honoured guests. How much of this change\nin his disposition was to be ascribed to the beauty and simplicity of\nMiss Ashton, to the readiness with which she accommodated herself to the\ninconveniences of her situation; how much to the smooth and plausible\nconversation of the Lord Keeper, remarkably gifted with those words\nwhich win the ear, must be left to the reader's ingenuity to conjecture.\nBut Ravenswood was insensible to neither.\n\nThe Lord Keeper was a veteran statesman, well acquainted with courts\nand cabinets, and intimate with all the various turns of public affairs\nduring the last eventful years of the 17th century. He could talk, from\nhis own knowledge, of men and events, in a way which failed not to win\nattention, and had the peculiar art, while he never said a word which\ncommitted himself, at the same time to persuade the hearer that he was\nspeaking without the least shadow of scrupulous caution or reserve.\nRavenswood, in spite of his prejudices and real grounds of resentment,\nfelt himself at once amused and instructed in listening to him, while\nthe statesman, whose inward feelings had at first so much impeded his\nefforts to make himself known, had now regained all the ease and fluency\nof a silver-tongued lawyer of the very highest order.\n\nHis daughter did not speak much, but she smiled; and what she did say\nargued a submissive gentleness, and a desire to give pleasure, which,\nto a proud man like Ravenswood, was more fascinating than the most\nbrilliant wit. Above all, he could not be observe that, whether from\ngratitude or from some other motive, he himself, in his deserted and\nunprovided hall, was as much the object of respectful attention to his\nguests as he would have been when surrounded by all the appliances and\nmeans of hospitality proper to his high birth. All deficiencies passed\nunobserved, or, if they did not escape notice, it was to praise the\nsubstitutes which Caleb had contrived to supply the want of the\nusual accommodations. Where a smile was unavoidable, it was a very\ngood-humoured one, and often coupled with some well-turned compliment,\nto show how much the guests esteemed the merits of their noble host,\nhow little they thought of the inconveniences with which they\nwere surrounded. I am not sure whether the pride of being found to\noutbalance, in virtue of his own personal merit, all the disadvantages\nof fortune, did not make as favourable an impression upon the haughty\nheart of the Master of Ravenswood as the conversation of the father and\nthe beauty of Lucy Ashton.\n\nThe hour of repose arrived. The Keeper and his daughter retired to their\napartments, which were “decored” more properly than could have been\nanticipated. In making the necessary arrangements, Mysie had indeed\nenjoyed the assistance of a gossip who had arrived from the village upon\nan exploratory expedition, but had been arrested by Caleb, and impressed\ninto the domestic drudgery of the evening; so that, instead of returning\nhome to describe the dress and person of the grand young lady, she found\nherself compelled to be active in the domestic economy of Wolf's Crag.\n\nAccording to the custom of the time, the Master of Ravenswood attended\nthe Lord Keeper to his apartment, followed by Caleb, who placed on the\ntable, with all the ceremonials due to torches of wax, two rudely-framed\ntallow-candles, such as in those days were only used by the peasantry,\nhooped in paltry clasps of wire, which served for candlesticks. He then\ndisappeared, and presently entered with two earthen flagons (the china,\nhe said, had been little used since my lady's time), one filled with\ncanary wine, the other with brandy. The canary sack, unheeding all\nprobabilities of detection, he declared had been twenty years in the\ncellars of Wolf's Crag, “though it was not for him to speak before their\nhonours; the brandy--it was weel-kenn'd liquor, as mild as mead and as\nstrong as Sampson; it had been in the house ever since the memorable\nrevel, in which auld Micklestob had been slain at the head of the stair\nby Jamie of Jenklebrae, on account of the honour of the worshipful Lady\nMuirend, wha was in some sort an ally of the family; natheless----”\n\n“But to cut that matter short, Mr. Caleb,” said the Keeper, “perhaps you\nwill favour me with a ewer of water.”\n\n“God forbid your lordship should drink water in this family,” replied\nCaleb, “to the disgrace of so honourable an house!”\n\n“Nevertheless, if his lordship have a fancy,” said the Master, smiling,\n“I think you might indulge him; for, if I mistake not, there has been\nwater drank here at no distant date, and with good relish too.”\n\n“To be sure, if his lordship has a fancy,” said Caleb; and re-entering\nwith a jug of pure element--“He will scarce find such water onywhere as\nis drawn frae the well at Wolf's Crag; nevertheless----”\n\n“Nevertheless, we must leave the Lord Keeper to his repose in this\npoor chamber of ours,” said the Master of Ravenswood, interrupting\nhis talkative domestic, who immediately turning to the doorway, with\na profound reverence, prepared to usher his master from the secret\nchamber.\n\nBut the Lord Keeper prevented his host's departure.--“I have but one\nword to say to the Master of Ravenswood, Mr. Caleb, and I fancy he will\nexcuse your waiting.”\n\nWith a second reverence, lower than the former, Caleb withdrew; and his\nmaster stood motionless, expecting, with considerable embarrassment,\nwhat was to close the events of a day fraught with unexpected incidents.\n\n“Master of Ravenswood,” said Sir William Ashton, with some\nembarrassment, “I hope you understand the Christian law too well to\nsuffer the sun to set upon your anger.”\n\nThe Master blushed and replied, “He had no occasion that evening to\nexercise the duty enjoined upon him by his Christian faith.”\n\n“I should have thought otherwise,” said his guest, “considering the\nvarious subjects of dispute and litigation which have unhappily occurred\nmore frequently than was desirable or necessary betwixt the late\nhonourable lord, your father, and myself.”\n\n“I could wish, my lord,” said Ravenswood, agitated by suppressed\nemotion, “that reference to these circumstances should be made anywhere\nrather than under my father's roof.”\n\n“I should have felt the delicacy of this appeal at another time,” said\nSir William Ashton, “but now I must proceed with what I mean to say.\nI have suffered too much in my own mind, from the false delicacy which\nprevented my soliciting with earnestness, what indeed I frequently\nrequested, a personal communing with your father: much distress of mind\nto him and to me might have been prevented.”\n\n“It is true,” said Ravenswood, after a moment's reflection, “I have\nheard my father say your lordship had proposed a personal interview.”\n\n“Proposed, my dear Master? I did indeed propose it; but I ought to have\nbegged, entreated, beseeched it. I ought to have torn away the veil,\nwhich interested persons had stretched betwixt us, and shown myself as\nI was, willing to sacrifice a considerable part even of my legal rights,\nin order to conciliate feelings so natural as his must be allowed to\nhave been. Let me say for myself, my young friend, for so I will call\nyou, that had your father and I spent the same time together which\nmy good fortune has allowed me to-day to pass in your company, it is\npossible the land might yet have enjoyed one of the most respectable of\nits ancient nobility, and I should have been spared the pain of parting\nin enmity from a person whose general character I so much admired and\nhonoured.”\n\nHe put his handkerchief to his eyes. Ravenswood also was moved, but\nawaited in silence the progress of this extraordinary communication.\n\n“It is necessary,” continued the Lord Keeper, “and proper that you\nshould understand, that there have been many points betwixt us, in\nwhich, although I judged it proper that there should be an exact\nascertainment of my legal rights by the decree of a court of justice,\nyet it was never my intention to press them beyond the verge of equity.”\n\n“My lord,” said the Master of Ravenswood, “it is unnecessary to pursue\nthis topic farther. What the law will give you, or has given you, you\nenjoy--or you shall enjoy; neither my father nor I myself would have\nreceived anything on the footing of favour.”\n\n“Favour! No, you misunderstand me,” resumed the Keeper; “or rather you\nare no lawyer. A right may be good in law, and ascertained to be so,\nwhich yet a man of honour may not in every case care to avail himself\nof.”\n\n“I am sorry for it, my lord,” said the Master.\n\n“Nay, nay,” retorted his guest, “you speak like a young counsellor;\nyour spirit goes before your wit. There are many things still open for\ndecision betwixt us. Can you blame me, an old man desirous of peace, and\nin the castle of a young nobleman who has saved my daughter's life and\nmy own, that I am desirous, anxiously desirous, that these should be\nsettled on the most liberal principles?” The old man kept fast hold of\nthe Master's passive hand as he spoke, and made it impossible for him,\nbe his predetermination what it would, to return any other than an\nacquiescent reply; and wishing his guest good-night, he postponed\nfarther conference until the next morning.\n\nRavenswood hurried into the hall, where he was to spend the night, and\nfor a time traversed its pavement with a disordered and rapid pace.\nHis mortal foe was under his roof, yet his sentiments towards him were\nneither those of a feudal enemy nor of a true Christian. He felt as if\nhe could neither forgive him in the one character, nor follow forth his\nvengeance in the other, but that he was making a base and dishonourable\ncomposition betwixt his resentment against the father and his affection\nfor his daughter. He cursed himself, as he hurried to and fro in the\npale moonlight, and more ruddy gleams of the expiring wood-fire. He\nthrew open and shut the latticed windows with violence, as if alike\nimpatient of the admission and exclusion of free air. At length,\nhowever, the torrent of passion foamed off its madness, and he flung\nhimself into the chair which he proposed as his place of repose for the\nnight.\n\n“If, in reality,” such were the calmer thoughts that followed the first\ntempest of his passion--“if, in reality, this man desires no more than\nthe law allows him--if he is willing to adjust even his acknowledged\nrights upon an equitable footing, what could be my father's cause of\ncomplaint?--what is mine? Those from who we won our ancient possessions\nfell under the sword of my ancestors, and left lands and livings to the\nconquerors; we sink under the force of the law, now too powerful for the\nScottish cavalry. Let us parley with the victors of the day, as if we\nhad been besieged in our fortress, and without hope of relief. This\nman may be other than I have thought him; and his daughter--but I have\nresolved not to think of her.”\n\nHe wrapt his cloak around him, fell asleep, and dreamed of Lucy Ashton\ntill daylight gleamed through the lattices.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n     We worldly men, when we see friends and kinsmen\n     Past hope sunk in their fortunes, lend no hand\n     To lift them up, but rather set our feet\n     Upon their heads to press them to the bottom,\n     As I must yield with you I practised it;\n     But now I see you in a way to rise,\n     I can and will assist you.\n\n     New Way to Pay Old Debts.\n\nTHE Lord Keeper carried with him, to a couch harder than he was\naccustomed to stretch himself upon, the same ambitious thoughts and\npolitical perplexities which drive sleep from the softest down that ever\nspread a bed of state. He had sailed long enough amid the contending\ntides and currents of the time to be sensible of their peril, and of\nthe necessity of trimming his vessel to the prevailing wind, if he would\nhave her escape shipwreck in the storm. The nature of his talents, and\nthe timorousness of disposition connected with them, had made him assume\nthe pliability of the versatile old Earl of Northampton, who explained\nthe art by which he kept his ground during all the changes of state,\nfrom the reign of Henry VIII. to that of Elizabeth, by the frank avowal,\nthat he was born of the willow, not of the oak. It had accordingly been\nSir William Ashton's policy, on all occasions, to watch the changes\nin the political horizon, and, ere yet the conflict was decided, to\nnegotiate some interest for himself with the party most likely to prove\nvictorious. His time-serving disposition was well-known, and excited the\ncontempt of the more daring leaders of both factions in the state. But\nhis talents were of a useful and practical kind, and his legal\nknowledge held in high estimation; and they so far counterbalanced other\ndeficiencies that those in power were glad to use and to reward, though\nwithout absolutely trusting or greatly respecting, him.\n\nThe Marquis of A---- had used his utmost influence to effect a change in\nthe Scottish cabinet, and his schemes had been of late so well laid\nand so ably supported, that there appeared a very great chance of his\nproving ultimately successful. He did not, however, feel so strong or so\nconfident as to neglect any means of drawing recruits to his standard.\nThe acquisition of the Lord Keeper was deemed of some importance, and\na friend, perfectly acquainted with his circumstances and character,\nbecame responsible for his political conversion.\n\nWhen this gentleman arrived at Ravenswood Castle upon a visit, the real\npurpose of which was disguised under general courtesy, he found the\nprevailing fear which at present beset the Lord Keeper was that of\ndanger to his own person from the Master of Ravenswood. The language\nwhich the blind sibyl, Old Alice, had used; the sudden appearance of the\nMaster, armed, and within his precincts, immediately after he had been\nwarned against danger from him; the cold and haughty return received in\nexchange for the acknowledgments with which he loaded him for his timely\nprotection, had all made a strong impression on his imagination.\n\nSo soon as the Marquis's political agent found how the wind sate,\nhe began to insinuate fears and doubts of another kind, scarce less\ncalculated to affect the Lord Keeper. He inquired with seeming interest,\nwhether the proceedings in Sir William's complicated litigation with the\nRavenswood family were out of court, and settled without the possibility\nof appeal. The Lord Keeper answered in the affirmative; but his\ninterrogator was too well informed to be imposed upon. He pointed out to\nhim, by unanswerable arguments, that some of the most important points\nwhich had been decided in his favour against the house of Ravenswood\nwere liable, under the Treaty of Union, to be reviewed by the British\nHouse of Peers, a court of equity of which the Lord Keeper felt an\ninstinctive dread. This course came instead of an appeal to the old\nScottish Parliament, or, as it was technically termed, “a protestation\nfor remeid in law.”\n\nThe Lord Keeper, after he had for some time disputed the legality of\nsuch a proceeding, was compelled, at length, to comfort himself with\nthe improbability of the young Master of Ravenswood's finding friends in\nparliament capable of stirring in so weighty an affair.\n\n“Do not comfort yourself with that false hope,” said his wily friend;\n“it is possible that, in the next session of Parliament, young\nRavenswood may find more friends and favour even than your lordship.”\n\n“That would be a sight worth seeing,” said the Keeper, scornfully.\n\n“And yet,” said his friend, “such things have been seen ere now, and in\nour own time. There are many at the head of affairs even now that a few\nyears ago were under hiding for their lives; and many a man now dines\non plate of silver that was fain to eat his crowdy without a bicker; and\nmany a high head has been brought full low among us in as short a space.\nScott of Scotsarvet's Staggering State of Scots Statesmen, of which\ncurious memoir you showed me a manuscript, has been outstaggered in our\ntime.”\n\nThe Lord Keeper answered with a deep sigh, “That these mutations were no\nnew sights in Scotland, and had been witnessed long before the time of\nthe satirical author he had quoted. It was many a long year,” he said,\n“since Fordun had quoted as an ancient proverb, 'Neque dives, neque\nfortis, sed nec sapiens Scotus, praedominante invidia, diu durabit in\nterra.'”\n\n“And be assured, my esteemed friend,” was the answer, “that even your\nlong services to the state, or deep legal knowledge, will not save you,\nor render your estate stable, if the Marquis of A---- comes in with\na party in the British Parliament. You know that the deceased Lord\nRavenswood was his near ally, his lady being fifth in descent from the\nKnight of Tillibardine; and I am well assured that he will take young\nRavenswood by the hand, and be his very good lord and kinsman. Why\nshould he not? The Master is an active and stirring young fellow, able\nto help himself with tongue and hands; and it is such as he that\nfinds friends among their kindred, and not those unarmed and unable\nMephibosheths that are sure to be a burden to every one that takes them\nup. And so, if these Ravenswood cases be called over the coals in the\nHouse of Peers, you will find that the Marquis will have a crow to pluck\nwith you.”\n\n“That would be an evil requital,” said the Lord Keeper, “for my long\nservices to the state, and the ancient respect in which I have held his\nlordship's honourable family and person.”\n\n“Ay, but,” rejoined the agent of the Marquis, “it is in vain to look\nback on past service and auld respect, my lord; it will be present\nservice and immediate proofs of regard which, in these sliddery times,\nwill be expected by a man like the Marquis.”\n\nThe Lord Keeper now saw the full drift of his friend's argument, but he\nwas too cautious to return any positive answer.\n\n“He knew not,” he said, “the service which the Lord Marquis could expect\nfrom one of his limited abilities, that had not always stood at his\ncommand, still saving and reserving his duty to his king and country.”\n\nHaving thus said nothing, while he seemed to say everything, for the\nexception was calculated to cover whatever he might afterwards think\nproper to bring under it, Sir William Ashton changed the conversation,\nnor did he again permit the same topic to be introduced. His guest\ndeparted, without having brought the wily old statesman the length\nof committing himself, or of pledging himself to any future line of\nconduct, but with the certainty that he had alarmed his fears in a most\nsensible point, and laid a foundation for future and farther treaty.\n\nWhen he rendered an account of his negotiation to the Marquis, they\nboth agreed that the Keeper ought not to be permitted to relapse into\nsecurity, and that he should be plied with new subjects of alarm,\nespecially during the absence of his lady. They were well aware that her\nproud, vindictive, and predominating spirit would be likely to supply\nhim with the courage in which he was deficient; that she was immovably\nattached to the party now in power, with whom she maintained a close\ncorrespondence and alliance; and that she hated, without fearing, the\nRavenswood family (whose more ancient dignity threw discredit on the\nnewly acquired grandeur of her husband) to such a degree that she would\nhave perilled the interest of her own house to have the prospect of\naltogether crushing that of her enemy.\n\nBut Lady Ashton was now absent. The business which had long detained her\nin Edinburgh had afterwards induced her to travel to London, not without\nthe hope that she might contribute her share to disconcert the\nintrigues of the Marquis at court; for she stood high in favour with\nthe celebrated Sarah Duchesss of Marlborough, to whom, in point of\ncharacter, she bore considerable resemblance. It was necessary to press\nher husband hard before her return; and, as a preparatory step, the\nMarquis wrote to the Master of Ravenswood the letter which we rehearsed\nin a former chapter. It was cautiously worded, so as to leave it in the\npower of the writer hereafter to take as deep or as slight an interest\nin the fortunes of his kinsmen as the progress of his own schemes might\nrequire. But however unwilling, as a statesman, the Marquis might be\nto commit himself, or assume the character of a patron, while he had\nnothing to give away, it must be said to his honour that he felt a\nstrong inclination effectually to befriend the Master of Ravenswood, as\nwell as to use his name as a means of alarming the terrors of the Lord\nKeeper.\n\nAs the messenger who carried this letter was to pass near the house of\nthe Lord Keeper, he had it in direction that, in the village adjoining\nto the park-gate of the castle, his horse should lose a shoe, and that,\nwhile it was replaced by the smith of the place, he should express the\nutmost regret for the necessary loss of time, and in the vehemence of\nhis impatience give it to be understood that he was bearing a message\nfrom the Marquis of A---- to the Master of Ravenswood upon a matter of\nlife and death.\n\nThis news, with exaggerations, was speedily carried from various\nquarters to the ears of the Lord Keeper, and each reporter dwelt upon\nthe extreme impatience of the courier, and the surprising short time\nin which he had executed his journey. The anxious statesman heard in\nsilence; but in private Lockhard received orders to watch the courier\non his return, to waylay him in the village, to ply him with liquor, if\npossible, and to use all means, fair or foul, to learn the contents\nof the letter of which he was the bearer. But as this plot had been\nforeseen, the messenger returned by a different and distant road, and\nthus escaped the snare that was laid for him.\n\nAfter he had been in vain expected for some time, Mr. Dingwall had\norders to made especial inquiry among his clients of Wolf's Hope,\nwhether such a domestic belonging to the Marquis of A----had actually\narrived at the neighbouring castle. This was easily ascertained; for\nCaleb had been in the village one morning by five o'clock, to borrow\n“twa chappins of ale and a kipper” for the messenger's refreshment,\nand the poor fellow had been ill for twenty-four hours at Luckie\nSma'trash's, in consequence of dining upon “saut saumon and sour drink.”\n So that the existence of a correspondence betwixt the Marquis and his\ndistressed kinsman, which Sir William Ashton had sometimes treated as a\nbugbear, was proved beyond the possibility of further doubt.\n\nThe alarm of the Lord Keeper became very serious; since the Claim of\nRight, the power of appealing from the decisions of the civil court to\nthe Estates of Parliament, which had formerly been held incompetent, had\nin many instances been claimed, and in some allowed, and he had no small\nreason to apprehend the issue, if the English House of Lords should be\ndisposed to act upon an appeal from the Master of Ravenswood “for remeid\nin law.” It would resolve into an equitable claim, and be decided,\nperhaps, upon the broad principles of justice, which were not quite so\nfavourable to the Lord Keeper as those of strict law. Besides, judging,\nthough most inaccurately, from courts which he had himself known in the\nunhappy times preceding the Scottish Union, the Keeper might have too\nmuch right to think that, in the House to which his lawsuits were to be\ntransferred, the old maxim might prevail which was too well recognised\nin Scotland in former times: “Show me the man, and I'll show you the\nlaw.” The high and unbiased character of English judicial proceedings\nwas then little known in Scotland, and the extension of them to that\ncountry was one of the most valuable advantages which it gained by the\nUnion. But this was a blessing which the Lord Keeper, who had lived\nunder another system, could not have the means of foreseeing. In the\nloss of his political consequence, he anticipated the loss of his\nlawsuit. Meanwhile, every report which reached him served to render\nthe success of the Marquis's intrigues the more probable, and the Lord\nKeeper began to think it indispensable that he should look round for\nsome kind of protection against the coming storm. The timidity of his\ntemper induced him to adopt measures of compromise and conciliation. The\naffair of the wild bull, properly managed, might, he thought, be made\nto facilitate a personal communication and reconciliation betwixt the\nMaster and himself. He would then learn, if possible, what his own ideas\nwere of the extent of his rights, and the means of enforcing them; and\nperhaps matters might be brought to a compromise, where one party was\nwealthy and the other so very poor. A reconciliation with Ravenswood was\nlikely to give him an opportunity to play his own game with the Marquis\nof A----. “And besides,” said he to himself, “it will be an act of\ngenerosity to raise up the heir of this distressed family; and if he is\nto be warmly and effectually befriended by the new government, who knows\nbut my virtue may prove its own reward?”\n\nThus thought Sir William Ashton, covering with no unusual self-delusion\nhis interested views with a hue of virtue; and having attained this\npoint, his fancy strayed still farther. He began to bethink himself,\n“That if Ravenswood was to have a distinguished place of power and\ntrust, and if such a union would sopite the heavier part of his\nunadjusted claims, there might be worse matches for his daughter Lucy:\nthe Master might be reponed against the attainder. Lord Ravenswood was\nan ancient title, and the alliance would, in some measure, legitimate\nhis own possession of the greater part of the Master's spoils, and make\nthe surrender of the rest a subject of less bitter regret.”\n\nWith these mingled and multifarious plans occupying his head, the Lord\nKeeper availed himself of my Lord Bittlebrains's repeated invitation\nto his residence, and thus came within a very few miles of Wolf's\nCrag. Here he found the lord of the mansion absent, but was courteously\nreceived by the lady, who expected her husband's immediate return. She\nexpressed her particular delight at seeing Miss Ashton, and appointed\nthe hounds to be taken out for the Lord Keeper's special amusement.\nHe readily entered into the proposal, as giving him an opportunity to\nreconnoitre Wolf's Crag, and perhaps to make some acquaintance with the\nowner, if he should be tempted from his desolate mansion by the\nchase. Lockhard had his orders to endeavour on his part to make some\nacquaintance with the inmates of the castle, and we have seen how he\nplayed his part.\n\nThe accidental storm did more to further the Lord Keeper's plan of\nforming a personal acquaintance with young Ravenswood than his most\nsanguine expectations could have anticipated. His fear of the young\nnobleman's personal resentment had greatly decreased since he considered\nhim as formidable from his legal claims and the means he might have of\nenforcing them. But although he thought, not unreasonably, that only\ndesperate circumstances drove men on desperate measures, it was not\nwithout a secret terror, which shook his heart within him, that he first\nfelt himself inclosed within the desolate Tower of Wolf's Crag; a place\nso well fitted, from solitude and strength, to be a scene of violence\nand vengeance. The stern reception at first given to them by the Master\nof Ravenswood, and the difficulty he felt in explaining to that injured\nnobleman what guests were under the shelter of his roof, did not soothe\nthese alarms; so that when Sir William Ashton heard the door of the\ncourtyard shut behind him with violence, the words of Alice rung in his\nears, “That he had drawn on matters too hardly with so fierce a race as\nthose of Ravenswood, and that they would bide their time to be avenged.”\n\nThe subsequent frankness of the Master's hospitality, as their\nacquaintance increased, abated the apprehensions these recollections\nwere calculated to excite; and it did not escape Sir William Ashton,\nthat it was to Lucy's grace and beauty he owed the change in their\nhost's behavior.\n\nAll these thoughts thronged upon him when he took possession of\nthe secret chamber. The iron lamp, the unfurnished apartment, more\nresembling a prison than a place of ordinary repose, the hoarse and\nceaseless sound of the waves rushing against the base of the rock on\nwhich the castle was founded, saddened and perplexed his mind. To his\nown successful machinations, the ruin of the family had been in a great\nmeasure owing, but his disposition was crafty, and not cruel; so\nthat actually to witness the desolation and distress he had himself\noccasioned was as painful to him as it would be to the humane mistress\nof a family to superintend in person the execution of the lambs and\npoultry which are killed by her own directions. At the same time,\nwhen he thought of the alternative of restoring to Ravenswood a large\nproportion of his spoils, or of adopting, as an ally and member of his\nown family, the heir of this impoverished house, he felt as the spider\nmay be supposed to do when his whole web, the intricacies of which had\nbeen planned with so much art, is destroyed by the chance sweep of a\nbroom. And then, if he should commit himself too far in this matter, it\ngave rise to a perilous question, which many a good husband, when under\ntemptation to act as a free agent, has asked himself without being able\nto return a satisfactory answer: “What will my wife--what will Lady\nAshton say?” On the whole, he came at length to the resolution in\nwhich minds of a weaker cast so often take refuge. He resolved to\nwatch events, to take advantage of circumstances as they occurred, and\nregulate his conduct accordingly. In this spirit of temporising policy,\nhe at length composed his mind to rest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n     A slight note I have about me for you, for the delivery of which\n     you must excuse me. It is an offer that friendship calls upon me\n     to do, and no way offensive to you, since I desire nothing but\n     right upon both sides.\n\n     King and no King.\n\nWHEN Ravenswood and his guest met in the morning, the gloom of the\nMaster's spirit had in part returned. He, also, had passed a night\nrather of reflection that of slumber; and the feelings which he could\nnot but entertain towards Lucy Ashton had to support a severe conflict\nagainst those which he had so long nourished against her father. To\nclasp in friendship the hand of the enemy of his house, to entertain him\nunder his roof, to exchange with him the courtesies and the kindness of\ndomestic familiarity, was a degradation which his proud spirit could not\nbe bent to without a struggle.\n\nBut the ice being once broken, the Lord Keeper was resolved it should\nnot have time against to freeze. It had been part of his plan to stun\nand confuse Ravenswood's ideas, by a complicated and technical statement\nof the matters which had been in debate betwixt their families, justly\nthinking that it would be difficult for a youth of his age to follow\nthe expositions of a practical lawyer, concerning actions of compt and\nreckoning, and of multiplepoindings, and adjudications and wadsets,\nproper and improper, and poindings of the ground, and declarations of\nthe expiry of the legal. “Thus,” thought Sir William, “I shall have\nall the grace of appearing perfectly communicative, while my party will\nderive very little advantage from anything I may tell him.” He therefore\ntook Ravenswood aside into the deep recess of a window in the hall, and\nresuming the discourse of the proceeding evening, expressed a hope that\nhis young friend would assume some patience, in order to hear him enter\nin a minute and explanatory detail of those unfortunate circumstances\nin which his late honourable father had stood at variance with the Lord\nKeeper. The Master of Ravenswood coloured highly, but was silent; and\nthe Lord Keeper, though not greatly approving the sudden heightening\nof his auditor's complexion, commenced the history of a bond for twenty\nthousand merks, advanced by his father to the father of Allan Lord\nRavenswood, and was proceeding to detail the executorial proceedings\nby which this large sum had been rendered a debitum fundi, when he was\ninterrupted by the Master.\n\n“It is not in this place,” he said, “that I can hear Sir William\nAshton's explanation of the matters in question between us. It is not\nhere, where my father died of a broken heart, that I can with decency\nor temper investigate the cause of his distress. I might remember that I\nwas a son, and forget the duties of a host. A time, however, there must\ncome, when these things shall be discussed, in a place and in a presence\nwhere both of us will have equal freedom to speak and to hear.”\n\n“Any time,” the Lord Keeper said, “any place, was alike to those who\nsought nothing but justice. Yet it would seem he was, in fairness,\nentitled to some premonition respecting the grounds upon which the\nMaster proposed to impugn the whole train of legal proceedings, which\nhad been so well and ripely advised in the only courts competent.”\n\n“Sir William Ashton,” answered the Master, with warmth, “the lands which\nyou now occupy were granted to my remote ancestor for services done with\nhis sword against the English invaders. How they have glided from us by\na train of proceedings that seem to be neither sale, nor mortgage, nor\nadjudication for debt, but a nondescript and entangled mixture of all\nthese rights; how annual rent has been accumulated upon principal, and\nno nook or coign of legal advantage left unoccupied, until our interest\nin our hereditary property seems to have melted away like an icicle in\nthaw--all this you understand better than I do. I am willing, however,\nto suppose, from the frankness of your conduct towards me, that I may in\na great measure have mistaken your personal character, and that things\nmay have appeared right and fitting to you, a skilful and practised\nlawyer, which to my ignorant understanding seem very little short of\ninjustice and gross oppression.”\n\n“And you, my dear Master,” answered Sir William--“you, permit me to say,\nhave been equally misrepresented to me. I was taught to believe you\na fierce, imperious, hot-headed youth, ready, at the slightest\nprovocation, to throw your sword into the scales of justice, and to\nappeal to those rude and forcible measures from which civil polity has\nlong protected the people of Scotland. Then, since we were mutually\nmistaken in each other, why should not the young nobleman be willing\nto listen to the old lawyer, while, at least, he explains the points of\ndifference betwixt them?”\n\n“No, my lord,” answered Ravenswood; “it is in the House of British\nPeers, whose honour must be equal to their rank--it is in the court of\nlast resort that we must parley together. The belted lords of Britain,\nher ancient peers, must decide, if it is their will that a house,\nnot the least noble of their members, shall be stripped of their\npossessions, the reward of the patriotism of generations, as the pawn of\na wretched mechanic becomes forfeit to the usurer the instant the hour\nof redemption has passed away. If they yield to the grasping severity of\nthe creditor, and to the gnawing usury that eats into our lands as moths\ninto a raiment, it will be of more evil consequence to them and their\nposterity than to Edgar Ravenswood. I shall still have my sword and my\ncloak, and can follow the profession of arms wherever a trumpet shall\nsound.”\n\nAs he pronounced these words, in a firm yet melancholy tone, he raised\nhis eyes, and suddenly encountered those of Lucy Ashton, who had stolen\nunawares on their interview, and observed her looks fastened on them\nwith an expression of enthusiastic interest and admiration, which had\nwrapt her for the moment beyond the fear of discovery. The noble form\nand fine features of Ravenswood, fired with the pride of birth and sense\nof internal dignity, the mellow and expressive tones of his voice,\nthe desolate state of his fortunes, and the indifference with which he\nseemed to endure and to dare the worst that might befall, rendered him a\ndangerous object of contemplation for a maiden already too much\ndisposed to dwell upon recollections connected with him. When their eyes\nencountered each other, both blushed deeply, conscious of some strong\ninternal emotion, an shunned again to meet each other's looks. Sir\nWilliam Ashton had, of course, closely watched the expression of their\ncountenances. “I need fear,” said he internally, “neither Parliament nor\nprotestation; I have an effectual mode of reconciling myself with this\nhot-tempered young fellow, in case he shall become formidable. The\npresent object is, at all events, to avoid committing ourselves. The\nhook is fixed; we will nto strain the line too soon: it is as well to\nreserve the privilege of slipping it loose, if we do not find the fish\nworth landing.”\n\nIn this selfish and cruel calculation upon the supposed attachment of\nRavenswood to Lucy, he was so far from considering the pain he might\ngive to the former, by thus dallying with his affections, that he even\ndid not think upon the risk of involving his own daughter in the perils\nof an unfortunate passion; as if her predilection, which could not\nescape his attention, were like the flame of a taper which might be\nlighted or extinguished at pleasure. But Providence had prepared a\ndreadful requital for this keen observer of human passions, who had\nspent his life in securing advantages to himself by artfully working\nupon the passions of others.\n\nCaleb Balderstone now came to announce that breakfast was prepared; for\nin those days of substantial feeding, the relics of the supper simply\nfurnished forth the morning meal. Neither did he forget to present to\nthe Lord Keeper, with great reverence, a morning draught in a large\npewter cup, garnished with leaves of parsley and scurvy-grass. He craved\npardon, of course, for having omitted to serve it in the great silver\nstanding cup as behoved, being that it was at present in a silversmith's\nin Edinburgh, for the purpose of being overlaid with gilt.\n\n“In Edinburgh like enough,” said Ravenswood; “but in what place, or for\nwhat purpose, I am afraid neither you nor I know.”\n\n“Aweel!” said Caleb, peevishly, “there's a man standing at the gate\nalready this morning--that's ae thing that I ken. Does your honour ken\nwhether ye will speak wi' him or no?”\n\n“Does he wish to speak with me, Caleb?”\n\n“Less will no serve him,” said Caleb; “but ye had best take a visie of\nhim through the wicket before opening the gate; it's no every ane we\nsuld let into this castle.”\n\n“What! do you suppose him to be a messenger come to arrest me for debt?”\n said Ravenswood.\n\n“A messenger arrest your honour for debt, and in your Castle of Wolf's\nCrag! Your honour is jesting wi' auld Caleb this morning.” However, he\nwhispered in his ear, as he followed him out, “I would be loth to do ony\ndecent man a prejudice in your honour's gude opinion; but I would tak\ntwa looks o' that chield before I let him within these walls.”\n\nHe was not an officer of the law, however; being no less a person than\nCaptain Craigengelt, with his nose as red as a comfortable cup of brandy\ncould make it, his laced cocked hat set a little aside upon the top\nof his black riding periwig, a sword by his side and pistols at his\nholsters, and his person arrayed in a riding suit, laid over with\ntarnished lace--the very moral of one who would say, “Stand to a true\nman.”\n\nWhen the Master had recognised him, he ordered the gates to be opened.\n“I suppose,” he said, “Captain Craigengelt, there are no such weighty\nmatters betwixt you and me, but may be discussed in this place. I have\ncompany in the castle at present, and the terms upon which we last\nparted must excuse my asking you to make part of them.”\n\nCraigengelt, although possessing the very perfection of impudence, was\nsomewhat abashed by this unfavourable reception. “He had no intention,”\n he said, “to force himself upon the Master of Ravenswood's hospitality;\nhe was in the honourable service of bearing a message to him from a\nfriend, otherwise the Master of Ravenswood should not have had reason to\ncomplain of this intrusion.”\n\n“Let it be short, sir,” said the Master, “for that will be the best\napology. Who is the gentleman who is so fortunate as to have your\nservices as a messenger?”\n\n“My friend, Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw,” answered Craigengelt, with\nconscious importance, and that confidence which the acknowledged courage\nof his principal inspired, “who conceives himself to have been treated\nby you with something much short of the respect which he had reason to\ndemand, and, therefore is resolved to exact satisfaction. I bring with\nme,” said he, taking a piece of paper out of his pocket, “the precise\nlength of his sword; and he requests you will meet him, accompanied by\na friend, and equally armed, at any place within a mile of the castle,\nwhen I shall give attendance as umpire, or second, on his behoof.”\n\n“Satisfaction! and equal arms!” repeated Ravenswood, who, the reader\nwill recollect, had no reason to suppose he had given the slightest\noffence to his late intimate; “upon my word, Captain Craigengelt, either\nyou have invented the most improbable falsehood that ever came into the\nmind of such a person, or your morning draught has been somewhat of the\nstrongest. What could persuade Bucklaw to send me such a message?”\n\n“For that, sir,” replied Craigengelt, “I am desired to refer you to\nwhat, in duty to my friend, I am to term your inhospitality in excluding\nhim from your house, without reasons assigned.”\n\n“It is impossible,” replied the Master; “he cannot be such a fool as to\ninterpret actual necessity as an insult. Nor do I believe that, knowing\nmy opinion of you, Captain, he would have employed the services of so\nslight and inconsiderable a person as yourself upon such an errand, as I\ncertainly could expect no man of honour to act with you in the office of\numpire.”\n\n“I slight and inconsiderable?” said Craigengelt, raising his voice, and\nlaying his hand on his cutlass; “if it were not that the quarrel of\nmy friend craves the precedence, and is in dependence before my own, I\nwould give you to understand----”\n\n“I can understand nothing upon your explanation, Captain Craigengelt. Be\nsatisfied of that, and oblige me with your departure.”\n\n“D----n!” muttered the bully; “and is this the answer which I am to\ncarry back to an honourable message?”\n\n“Tell the Laird of Bucklaw,” answered Ravenswood, “if you are really\nsent by him, that, when he sends me his cause of grievance by a person\nfitting to carry such an errand betwixt him and me, I will either\nexplain it or maintain it.”\n\n“Then, Master, you will at least cause to be returned to Hayston, by my\nhands, his property which is remaining in your possession.”\n\n“Whatever property Bucklaw may have left behind him, sir,” replied the\nMaster, “shall be returned to him by my servant, as you do not show me\nany credentials from him which entitle you to receive it.”\n\n“Well, Master,” said Captain Craigengelt, with malice which even his\nfear of the consequences could not suppress, “you have this morning done\nme an egregious wrong adn dishonour, but far more to yourself. A castle\nindeed!” he continued, looking around him; “why, this is worse than\na coupe-gorge house, where they receive travellers to plunder them of\ntheir property.”\n\n“You insolent rascal,” said the Master, raising his cane, and making a\ngrasp at the Captain's bridle, “if you do not depart without uttering\nanother syllable, I will batoon you to death!”\n\nAt the motion of the Master towards him, the bully turned so rapidly\nround, that with some difficulty he escaped throwing down his horse,\nwhose hoofs struck fire from the rocky pavement in every direction.\nRecovering him, however, with the bridle, he pushed for the gate, and\nrode sharply back again in the direction of the village.\n\nAs Ravenswood turned round to leave the courtyard after this dialogue,\nhe found that the Lord Keeper had descended from the hall, and\nwitnessed, though at the distance prescribed by politeness, his\ninterview with Craigengelt.\n\n“I have seen,” said the Lord Keeper, “that gentleman's face, and at no\ngreat distance of time; his name is Craig--Craig--something, is it not?”\n\n“Craigengelt is the fellow's name,” said the Master, “at least that by\nwhich he passes at present.”\n\n“Craig-in-guilt,” said Caleb, punning upon the word “craig,” which in\nScotch signifies throat; “if he is Craig-in-guilt just now, he is as\nlikely to be Craig-in-peril as ony chield I ever saw; the loon has\nwoodie written on his very visnomy, and I wad wager twa and a plack that\nhemp plaits his cravat yet.”\n\n“You understand physiognomy, good Mr. Caleb,” said the Keeper, smiling;\n“I assure you the gentleman has been near such a consummation before\nnow; for I most distinctly recollect that, upon occasion of a journey\nwhich I made about a fortnight ago to Edinburgh, I saw Mr. Craigengelt,\nor whatever is his name, undergo a severe examination before the privy\ncouncil.”\n\n“Upon what account?” said the Master of Ravenswood, with some interest.\n\nThe question led immediately to a tale which the Lord Keeper had been\nvery anxious to introduce, when he could find a graceful and fitting\nopportunity. He took hold of the Master's arm, and led him back towards\nthe hall. “The answer to your question,” he said, “though it is a\nridiculous business, is only fit for your own ear.”\n\nAs they entered the hall, he again took the Master apart into one of\nthe recesses of the window, where it will be easily believed that Miss\nAshton did not venture again to intrude upon their conference.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n     Here is a father now,\n     Will truck his daughter for a foreign venture,\n     Make her the stop-gap to some canker'd feud,\n     Or fling her o'er, like Jonah, to the fishes,\n     To appease the sea at highest.\n\n     Anonymous.\n\nTHE Lord Keeper opened his discourse with an appearance of unconcern,\nmarking, however, very carefully, the effect of his communication upon\nyoung Ravenswood.\n\n“You are aware,” he said, “my young friend, that suspicion is the\nnatural vice of our unsettled times, and exposes the best and wisest of\nus to the imposition of artful rascals. If I had been disposed to listen\nto such the other day, or even if I had been the wily politicians which\nyou have been taught to believe me, you, Master of Ravenswood, instead\nof being at freedom, and with fully liberty to solicit and act against\nme as you please, in defence of what you suppose to be your rights,\nwould have been in the Castle of Edinburgh, or some other state prison;\nor, if you had escaped that destiny, it must have been by flight to a\nforeign country, and at the risk of a sentence of fugitation.”\n\n“My Lord Keeper,” said the Master, “I think you would not jest on such a\nsubject; yet it seems impossible you can be in earnest.”\n\n“Innocence,” said the Lord Keeper, “is also confident, and sometimes,\nthough very excusably, presumptuously so.”\n\n“I do not understand,” said Ravenswood, “how a consciousess of innocence\ncan be, in any case, accounted presumptuous.”\n\n“Imprudent, at least, it may be called,” said Sir William Ashton, “since\nit is apt to lead us into the mistake of supposing that sufficiently\nevident to others of which, in fact, we are only conscious ourselves. I\nhave known a rogue, for this very reason, make a better defence than\nan innocent man could have done in the same circumstances of suspicion.\nHaving no consciousness of innocence to support him, such a fellow\napplies himself to all the advantages which the law will afford him, and\nsometimes--if his counsel be men of talent--succeeds in compelling his\njudges to receive him as innocent. I remember the celebrated case of Sir\nCoolie Condiddle of Condiddle, who was tried for theft under trust, of\nwhich all the world knew him guilty, and yet was not only acquitted, but\nlived to sit in judgment on honester folk.”\n\n“Allow me to beg you will return to the point,” said the Master; “you\nseemed to say that I had suffered under some suspicion.”\n\n“Suspicion, Master! Ay, truly, and I can show you the proofs of it; if\nI happen only to have them with me. Here, Lockhard.” His attendant came.\n“Fetch me the little private mail with the padlocks, that I recommended\nto your particular charge, d'ye hear?”\n\n“Yes, my lord.” Lockhard vanished; and the Keeper continued, as if half\nspeaking to himself.\n\n“I think the papers are with me--I think so, for, as I was to be in\nthis country, it was natural for me to bring them with me. I have them,\nhowever, at Ravenswood Castle, that I am sure; so perhaps you might\ncondescend----”\n\nHere Lockhard entered, and put the leathern scrutoire, or mail-box,\ninto his hands. The Keeper produced one or two papers, respecting the\ninformation laid before the privy council concerning the riot, as it was\ntermed, at the funeral of Allan Lord Ravenswood, and the active share he\nhad himself taken in quashing the proceedings against the Master. These\ndocuments had been selected with care, so as to irritate the natural\ncuriosity of Ravenswood upon such a subject, without gratifying it, yet\nto show that Sir William Ashton had acted upon that trying occasion\nthe part of an advocate and peacemaker betwixt him and the jealous\nauthorities of the day. Having furnished his host with such subjects for\nexamination, the Lord Keeper went to the breakfast-table, and entered\ninto light conversation, addressed partly to old Caleb, whose resentment\nagainst the usurper of the Castle of Ravenswood began to be softened by\nhis familiarity, and partly to his daughter.\n\nAfter perusing these papers, the Master of Ravenswood remained for\na minute or two with his hand pressed against his brow, in deep and\nprofound meditation. He then again ran his eye hastily over the papers,\nas if desirous of discovering in them some deep purpose, or some mark\nof fabrication, which had escaped him at first perusal. Apparently the\nsecond reading confirmed the opinion which had pressed upon him at the\nfirst, for he started from the stone bench on which he was sitting,\nand, going to the Lord Keeper, took his hand, and, strongly pressing it,\nasked his pardon repeatedly for the injustice he had done him, when it\nappeared he was experiencing, at his hands, the benefit of protection to\nhis person and vindication to his character.\n\nThe statesman received these acknowledgments at first with well-feigned\nsurprise, and then with an affectation of frank cordiality. The tears\nbegan already to start from Lucy's blue eyes at viewing this unexpected\nand moving scene. To see the Master, late so haughty and reserved, and\nwhom she had always supposed the injured person, supplicating her\nfather for forgiveness, was a change at once surprising, flattering, and\naffecting.\n\n“Dry your eyes, Lucy,” said her father; “why should you weep, because\nyour father, though a lawyer, is discovered to be a fair and honourable\nman? What have you to thank me for, my dear Master,” he continued,\naddressing Ravenswood, “that you would not have done in my case? 'Suum\ncuique tribuito,' was the Roman justice, and I learned it when I studied\nJustinian. Besides, have you not overpaid me a thousand times, in saving\nthe life of this dear child?”\n\n“Yes,” answered the Master, in all the remorse of self-accusation; “but\nthe little service _I_ did was an act of mere brutal instinct; YOUR\ndefence of my cause, when you knew how ill I thought of you, and how\nmuch I was disposed to be your enemy, was an act of generous, manly, and\nconsiderate wisdom.”\n\n“Pshaw!” said the Lord Keeper, “each of us acted in his own way; you as\na gallant soldier, I as an upright judge and privy-councillor. We could\nnot, perhaps, have changed parts; at least I should have made a very\nsorry tauridor, and you, my good Master, though your cause is so\nexcellent, might have pleaded it perhaps worse yourself than I who acted\nfor you before the council.”\n\n“My generous friend!” said Ravenswood; and with that brief word,\nwhich the Keeper had often lavished upon him, but which he himself now\npronounced for the first time, he gave to his feudal enemy the full\nconfidence of an haughty but honourable heart. The Master had been\nremarked among his contemporaries for sense and acuteness, as well\nas for his reserved, pertinacious, and irascible character. His\nprepossessions accordingly, however obstinate, were of a nature to give\nway before love and gratitude; and the real charms of the daughter,\njoined to the supposed services of the father, cancelled in his memory\nthe vows of vengeance which he had taken so deeply on the eve of his\nfather's funeral. But they had been heard and registered in the book of\nfate.\n\nCaleb was present at this extraordinary scene, and he could conceive no\nother reason for a proceeding so extraordinary than an alliance betwixt\nthe houses, and Ravenswood Castle assigned for the young lady's dowry.\nAs for Lucy, when Ravenswood uttered the most passionate excuses for his\nungrateful negligence, she could but smile through her tears, and, as\nshe abandoned her hand to him, assure him, in broken accents, of the\ndelight with which she beheld the complete reconciliation between her\nfather and her deliverer. Even the statesman was moved and affected\nby the fiery, unreserved, and generous self-abandonment with which the\nMaster of Ravenswood renounced his feudal enmity, and threw himself\nwithout hesitation upon his forgiveness. His eyes glistened as he looked\nupon a couple who were obviously becoming attached, and who seemed made\nfor each other. He thought how high the proud and chivalrous character\nof Ravenswood might rise under many circumstances in which HE found\nhimself “overcrowed,” to use a phrase of Spenser, and kept under, by\nhis brief pedigree, and timidity of disposition. Then his daughter--his\nfavorite child--his constant playmate--seemed formed to live happy in\na union with such a commanding spirit as Ravenswood; and even the fine,\ndelicate, fragile form of Lucy Ashton seemed to require the support of\nthe Master's muscular strength and masculine character. And it was not\nmerely during a few minutes that Sir William Ashton looked upon their\nmarriage as a probable and even desirable event, for a full hour\nintervened ere his imagination was crossed by recollection of the\nMaster's poverty, and the sure displeasure of Lady Ashton. It is\ncertain, that the very unusual flow of kindly feeling with which the\nLord Keeper had been thus surprised, was one of the circumstances which\ngave much tacit encouragement to the attachment between the Master and\nhis daughter, and led both the lovers distinctly to believe that it\nwas a connexion which would be most agreeable to him. He himself\nwas supposed to have admitted this in effect, when, long after\nthe catastrophe of their love, he used to warn his hearers against\npermitting their feelings to obtain an ascendency over their judgment,\nand affirm, that the greatest misfortune of his life was owing to a\nvery temporary predominance of sensibility over self-interest. It must\nbe owned, if such was the case, he was long and severely punished for an\noffence of very brief duration.\n\nAfter some pause, the Lord Keeper resumed the conversation.--\n\n“In your surprise at finding me an honester man than you expected, you\nhave lost your curiosity about this Craigengelt, my good Master; and yet\nyour name was brought in, in the course of that matter too.”\n\n“The scoundrel!” said Ravenswood. “My connexion with him was of the\nmost temporary nature possible; and yet I was very foolish to hold any\ncommunication with him at all. What did he say of me?”\n\n“Enough,” said the Keeper, “to excite the very loyal terrors of some\nof our sages, who are for proceeding against men on the mere grounds of\nsuspicion or mercenary information. Some nonsense about your proposing\nto enter into the service of France, or of the Pretender, I don't\nrecollect which, but which the Marquis of A----, one of your best\nfriends, and another person, whom some call one of your worst and most\ninterested enemies, could not, somehow, be brought to listen to.”\n\n“I am obliged to my honourable friend; and yet,” shaking the Lord\nKeeper's hand--“and yet I am still more obliged to my honourable enemy.”\n\n“Inimicus amicissimus,” said the Lord Keeper, returning the pressure;\n“but this gentleman--this Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw--I am afraid the\npoor young man--I heard the fellow mention his name--is under very bad\nguidance.”\n\n“He is old enough to govern himself,” answered the Master.\n\n“Old enough, perhaps, but scarce wise enough, if he has chosen this\nfellow for his fidus Achates. Why, he lodged an information against\nhim--that is, such a consequence might have ensued from his examination,\nhad we not looked rather at the character of the witness than the tenor\nof his evidence.”\n\n“Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw,” said the master, “is, I believe, a most\nhonourable man, and capable of nothing that is mean or disgraceful.”\n\n“Capable of much that is unreasonable, though; that you must needs\nallow, master. Death will soon put him in possession of a fair estate,\nif he hath it not already; old Lady Girnington--an excellent person,\nexcepting that her inveterate ill-nature rendered her intolerable to the\nwhole world--is probably dead by this time. Six heirs portioners have\nsuccessively died to make her wealthy. I know the estates well; they\nmarch with my own--a noble property.”\n\n“I am glad of it,” said Ravenswood, “and should be more so, were I\nconfident that Bucklaw would change his company and habits with his\nfortunes. This appearance of Craigengelt, acting in the capacity of his\nfriend, is a most vile augury for his future respectability.”\n\n“He is a bird of evil omen, to be sure,” said the Keeper, “and croaks\nof jail and gallows-tree. But I see Mr. Caleb grows impatient for our\nreturn to breakfast.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n     Sir, stay at home and take an old man's counsel;\n     Seek not to bask you by a stranger's hearth;\n     Our own blue smoke is warmer than their fire.\n     Domestic food is wholesome, though 'tis homely,\n     And foreign dainties poisonous, though tasteful.\n\n     The French Courtezan.\n\nTHE Master of Ravenswood took an opportunity to leave his guests\nto prepare for their departure, while he himself made the brief\narrangements necessary previous to his absence from Wolf's Crag for a\nday or two. It was necessary to communicate with Caleb on this occasion,\nand he found that faithful servitor in his sooty and ruinous den,\ngreatly delighted with the departure of their visitors, and computing\nhow long, with good management, the provisions which had been unexpended\nmight furnish the Master's table. “He's nae belly god, that's ae\nblessing; and Bucklaw's gane, that could have eaten a horse behind\nthe saddle. Cresses or water-purpie, and a bit ait-cake, can serve\nthe Master for breakfast as weel as Caleb. Then for dinner--there's no\nmuckle left on the spule-bane; it will brander, though--it will brander\nvery weel.”\n\nHis triumphant calculations were interrupted by the Master, who\ncommunicated to him, not without some hesitation, his purpose to ride\nwith the Lord Keeper as far as Ravenswood Castle, and to remain there\nfor a day or two.\n\n“The mercy of Heaven forbid!” said the old serving-man, turning as pal\nas the table-cloth which he was folding up.\n\n“And why, Caleb?” said his master--“why should the mercy of Heaven\nforbid my returning the Lord Keeper's visit?”\n\n“Oh, sir!” replied Caleb--“oh, Mr. Edgar! I am your servant, and it ill\nbecomes me to speak; but I am an auld servant--have served baith\nyour father and gudesire, and mind to have seen Lord Randal, your\ngreat-grandfather, but that was when I was a bairn.”\n\n“And what of all this, Balderstone?” said the Master; “what can\nit possibly have to do with my paying some ordinary civility to a\nneighbour.”\n\n“Oh, Mr. Edgar,--that is, my lord!” answered the butler, “your ain\nconscience tells you it isna for your father's son to be neighbouring\nwi' the like o' him; it isna for the credit of the family. An he were\nance come to terms, and to gie ye back your ain, e'en though ye suld\nhonour his house wi' your alliance, I suldna say na; for the young leddy\nis a winsome sweet creature. But keep your ain state wi' them--I ken the\nrace o' them weel--they will think the mair o' ye.”\n\n“Why, now, you go father than I do, Caleb,” said the Master, drowning a\ncertain degree of consciousness in a forced laugh; “you are for marrying\nme into a family that you will nto allow me to visit, how this? and you\nlook as pale as death besides.”\n\n“Oh, sir,” repeated Caleb again, “you would but laugh if I tauld it; but\nThomas the Rhymer, whose tongue couldna be fause, spoke the word of your\nhouse that will e'en prove ower true if you go to Ravenswood this day.\nOh, that it should e'er have been fulfilled in my time!”\n\n“And what is it, Caleb?” said Ravenswood, wishing to soothe the fears of\nhis old servant.\n\nCaleb replied: “He had never repeated the lines to living mortal; they\nwere told to him by an auld priest that had been confessor to Lord\nAllan's father when the family were Catholic. But mony a time,” he said,\n“I hae soughed thae dark words ower to myself, and, well-a-day! little\ndid I think of their coming round this day.”\n\n“Truce with your nonsense, and let me hear the doggerel which has put it\ninto your head,” said the Master, impatiently.\n\nWith a quivering voice, and a cheek pale with apprehension, Caleb\nfaltered out the following lines:\n\n“When the last Laird of Ravenswood to Ravenswood shall ride, And woo a\ndead maiden to be his bride, He shall stable his steed in the Kelpie's\nflow, And his name shall be lost for evermoe!”\n\n“I know the Kelpie's flow well enough,” said the Master; “I suppose, at\nleast, you mean the quicksand betwixt this tower and Wolf's Hope; but\nwhy any man in his senses should stable a steed there----”\n\n“Oh, ever speer ony thing about that, sir--God forbid we should ken what\nthe prophecy means--but just bide you at hame, and let the strangers\nride to Ravenswood by themselves. We have done eneugh for them; and\nto do mair would be mair against the credit of the family than in its\nfavour.”\n\n“Well, Caleb,” said the Master, “I give you the best possible credit for\nyour good advice on this occasion; but as I do not go to Ravenswood to\nseek a bride, dead or alive, I hope I shall choose a better stable for\nmy horse than the Kelpie's quicksand, and especially as I have always\nhad a particular dread of it since the patrol of dragoons were\nlost there ten years since. My father and I saw them from the tower\nstruggling against the advancing tide, and they were lost long before\nany help could reach them.”\n\n“And they deserved it weel, the southern loons!” said Caleb; “what had\nthey ado capering on our sands, and hindering a wheen honest folk frae\nbringing on shore a drap brandy? I hae seen them that busy, that I\nwad hae fired the auld culverin or the demi-saker that's on the south\nbartizan at them, only I was feared they might burst in the ganging\naff.”\n\nCaleb's brain was now fully engaged with abuse of the English soldiery\nand excisemen, so that his master found no great difficulty in\nescaping from him and rejoining his guests. All was now ready for\ntheir departure; and one of the Lord Keeper's grooms having saddled the\nMaster's steed, they mounted in the courtyard.\n\nCaleb had, with much toil, opened the double doors of the outward gate,\nand thereat stationed himself, endeavouring, by the reverential, and at\nthe same time consequential, air which he assumed, to supply, by his\nown gaunt, wasted, and thin person, the absence of a whole baronial\nestablishment of porters, warders, and liveried menials.\n\nThe Keeper returned his deep reverence with a cordial farewell, stooping\nat the same time from his horse, and sliding into the butler's hand the\nremuneration which in those days was always given by a departing guest\nto the domestics of the family where he had been entertained. Lucy\nsmiled on the old man with her usual sweetness, bade him adieu, and\ndeposited her guerdon with a grace of action and a gentleness of accent\nwhich could not have failed to have won the faithful retainer's heart,\nbut for Thomas the Rhymer, and the successful lawsuit against his\nmaster. As it was, he might have adopted the language of the Duke in As\nYou Like It:\n\nThou wouldst have better pleased me with this deed, If thou hadst told\nme of another father.\n\nRavenswood was at the lady's bridle-rein, encouraging her timidity, and\nguiding her horse carefully down the rocky path which led to the moor,\nwhen one of the servants announced from the rear that Caleb was calling\nloudly after them, desiring to speak with his master. Ravenswood felt it\nwould look singular to neglect this summons, although inwardly cursing\nCaleb for his impertinent officiousness; therefore he was compelled to\nrelinquish to Mr. Lockhard the agreeable duty in which he was engaged,\nand to ride back to the gate of the courtyard. Here he was beginning,\nsomewhat peevishly, to ask Caleb the cause of his clamour, when the good\nold man exclaimed: “Whisht, sir!--whisht, and let me speak just ae word\nthat I couldna say afore folk; there (putting into his lord's hand the\nmoney he had just received)--there's three gowd pieces; and ye'll\nwant siller up-bye yonder. But stay, whisht, now!” for the Master was\nbeginning to exclaim against this transference, “never say a word, but\njust see to get them changed in the first town ye ride through, for they\nare bran new frae the mint, and ken-speckle a wee bit.”\n\n“You forget, Caleb,” said his master, striving to force back the money\non his servant, and extricate the bridle from his hold--“you forget that\nI have some gold pieces left of my own. Keep these to yourself, my old\nfriend; and, once more, good day to you. I assure you, I have plenty.\nYou know you have managed that our living should cost us little or\nnothing.”\n\n“Aweel,” said Caleb, “these will serve for you another time; but see ye\nhae eneugh, for, doubtless, for the credit of the family, there maun be\nsome civility to the servants, and ye maun hae something to mak a show\nwith when they say, 'Master, will you bet a broad piece?' Then ye maun\ntak out your purse, and say, 'I carena if I do'; and tak care no to\nagree on the articles of the wager, and just put up your purse again,\nand----”\n\n“This is intolerable, Caleb; I really must be gone.”\n\n“And you will go, then?” said Caleb, loosening his hold upon the\nMaster's cloak, and changing his didactics into a pathetic and mournful\ntone--“and you WILL go, for a' I have told you about the prophecy, and\nthe dead bride, and the Kelpie's quicksand? Aweel! a wilful man maun\nhae his way: he that will to Cupar maun to Cupar. But pity of your life,\nsir, if ye be fowling or shooting in the Park, beware of drinking at the\nMermaiden's Well--He's gane! he's down the path arrow-flight after her!\nThe head is as clean taen aff the Ravenswood family this day as I wad\nchap the head aff a sybo!”\n\nThe old butler looked long after his master, often clearing away the dew\nas it rose to his eyes, that he might, as long as possible, distinguish\nhis stately form from those of the other horsemen. “Close to her\nbridle-rein--ay, close to her bridle-rein! Wisely saith the holy man,\n'By this also you may know that woman hath dominion over all men'; and\nwithout this lass would not our ruin have been a'thegither fulfilled.”\n\nWith a heart fraught with such sad auguries did Caleb return to\nhis necessary duties at Wofl's Crag, as soon as he could no longer\ndistinguish the object of his anxiety among the group of riders, which\ndiminished in the distance.\n\nIn the mean time the party pursued their route joyfully. Having once\ntaken his resolution, the Master of Ravenswood was not of a character to\nhesitate or pause upon it. He abandoned himself to the pleasure he felt\nin Miss Ashton's company, and displayed an assiduous gallantry which\napproached as nearly to gaiety as the temper of his mind and state of\nhis family permitted. The Lord Keeper was much struck with his depth of\nobservation, and the unusual improvement which he had derived from his\nstudies. Of these accomplishments Sir William Ashton's profession and\nhabits of society rendered him an excellent judge; and he well knew how\nto appreciate a quality to which he himself was a total stranger--the\nbrief and decided dauntlessness of the Master of Ravenswood's fear. In\nhis heart the Lord Keeper rejoiced at having conciliated an adversary\nso formidable, while, with a mixture of pleasure and anxiety, he\nanticipated the great things his young companion might achieve, were the\nbreath of court-favour to fill his sails.\n\n“What could she desire,” he thought, his mind always conjuring\nup opposition in the person of Lady Ashton to his new prevailing\nwish--“what could a woman desire in a match more than the sopiting of\na very dangerous claim, and the alliance of a son-in-law, noble, brave,\nwell-gifted, and highly connected; sure to float whenever the tide\nsets his way; strong, exactly where we are weak, in pedigree and in the\ntemper of a swordsman? Sure, no reasonable woman would hesitate. But\nalas----!” Here his argument was stopped by the consciousness that Lady\nAshton was not always reasonable, in his sense of the word. “To prefer\nsome clownish Merse laird to the gallant young nobleman, and to the\nsecure possession of Ravenswood upon terms of easy compromise--it would\nbe the act of a madwoman!”\n\nThus pondered the veteran politician, until they reached Bittlebrains\nHouse, where it had been previously settled they were to dine and repose\nthemselves, and prosecute their journey in the afternoon.\n\nThey were received with an excess of hospitality; and the most marked\nattention was offered to the Master of Ravenswood, in particular, by\ntheir noble entertainers. The truth was, that Lord Bittlebrains had\nobtained his peerage by a good deal of plausibility, an art of building\nup a character for wisdom upon a very trite style of commonplace\neloquence, a steady observation of the changes of the times, and the\npower of rendering certain political services to those who could best\nreward them. His lady and he, not feeling quite easy under their new\nhonours, to which use had not adapted their feelings, were very desirous\nto procure the fraternal countenance of those who were born denizens of\nthe regions into which they had been exalted from a lower sphere. The\nextreme attention which they paid to the Master of Ravenswood had its\nusual effect in exalting his importance in the eyes of the Lord\nKeeper, who, although he had a reasonable degree of contempt for\nLord Bittlebrains's general parts, entertained a high opinion of the\nacuteness of his judgment in all matters of self-interest.\n\n“I wish Lady Ashton had seen this,” was his internal reflection; “no man\nknows so well as Bittlebrains on which side his bread is buttered; and\nhe fawns on the Master like a beggar's messan on a cook. And my lady,\ntoo, bringing forward her beetle-browed misses to skirl and play upon\nthe virginals, as if she said, 'Pick and choose.' They are no more\ncomparable to Lucy than an owl is to a cygnet, and so they may carry\ntheir black brows to a farther market.”\n\nThe entertainment being ended, our travellers, who had still to measure\nthe longest part of their journey, resumed their horses; and after the\nLord Keeper, the Master, and the domestics had drunk doch-an-dorroch,\nor the stirrup-cup, in the liquors adapted to their various ranks, the\ncavalcade resumed its progress.\n\nIt was dark by the time they entered the avenue of Ravenswood Castle, a\nlong straight line leading directly to the front of the house, flanked\nwith huge elm-trees, which sighed to the night-wind, as if they\ncompassionated the heir of their ancient proprietors, who now returned\nto their shades in the society, and almost in the retinue, of their new\nmaster. Some feelings of the same kind oppressed the mind of the Master\nhimself. He gradually became silent, adn dropped a little behind the\nlady, at whose bridle-rein he had hitherto waited with such devotion.\nHe well recollected the period when, at the same hour in the evening, he\nhad accompanied his father, as that nobleman left, never again to\nreturn to it, the mansion from which he derived his name and title. The\nextensive front of the old castle, on which he remembered having often\nlooked back, was then “as black as mourning weed.” The same front now\nglanced with many lights, some throwing far forward into the night\na fixed and stationary blaze, and others hurrying from one window to\nanother, intimating the bustle and busy preparation preceding their\narrival, which had been intimated by an avant-courier. The contrast\npressed so strongly upon the Master's heart as to awaken some of the\nsterner feelings with which he had been accustomed to regard the new\nlord of his paternal domain, and to impress his countenance with an air\nof severe gravity, when, alighted from his horse, he stood in the hall\nno longer his own, surrounded by the numerous menials of its present\nowner.\n\nThe Lord Keeper, when about to welcome him with the cordiality which\ntheir late intercourse seemed to render proper, became aware of the\nchange, refrained from his purpose, and only intimated the ceremony of\nreception by a deep reverence to his guest, seeming thus delicately to\nshare the feelings which predominated on his brow.\n\nTwo upper domestics, bearing each a huge pair of silver candlesticks,\nnow marshalled the company into a large saloon, or withdrawing-room,\nwhere new alterations impressed upon Ravenswood the superior wealth of\nthe present inhabitants of the castle. The mouldering tapestry, which,\nin his father's time, had half covered the walls of this stately\napartment, and half streamed from them in tatters, had given place to\na complete finishing of wainscot, the cornice of which, as well as the\nframes of the various compartments, were ornamented with festoons of\nflowers and with birds, which, though carved in oak, seemed, such was\nthe art of the chisel, actually to swell their throats and flutter their\nwings. Several old family portraits of armed heroes of the house of\nRavenswood, together with a suit or two of old armour and some military\nweapons, had given place to those of King William and Queen Mary, or\nSir Thomas Hope and Lord Stair, two distinguished Scottish lawyers. The\npictures of the Lord Keeper's father and mother were also to be seen;\nthe latter, sour, shrewish, and solemn, in her black hood and close\npinners, with a book of devotion in her hand; the former, exhibiting\nbeneath a black silk Geneva cowl, or skull-cap, which sate as close to\nthe head as if it had been shaven, a pinched, peevish, Puritanical set\nof features, terminating in a hungry, reddish, peaked beard, forming on\nthe whole a countenance in the expression of which the hypocrite seemed\nto contend with the miser and the knave. “And it is to make room for\nsuch scarecrows as these,” thought Ravenswood, “that my ancestors have\nbeen torn down from the walls which they erected!” he looked at them\nagain, and, as he looked, the recollection of Lucy Ashton, for she\nhad not entered the apartment with them, seemed less lively in his\nimagination. There were also two or three Dutch drolleries, as the\npictures of Ostade and Teniers were then termed, with one good painting\nof the Italian school. There was, besides, a noble full-length of the\nLord Keeper in his robes of office, placed beside his lady in silk and\nermine, a haughty beauty, bearing in her looks all the pride of\nthe house of Douglas, from which she was descended. The painter,\nnotwithstanding his skill, overcome by the reality, or, perhaps, from a\nsuppressed sense of humour, had not been able to give the husband on the\ncanvas that air of awful rule and right supremacy which indicates the\nfull possession of domestic authority. It was obvious at the first\nglance that, despite mace and gold frogs, the Lord Keeper was somewhat\nhenpecked. The floor of this fine saloon was laid with rich carpets,\nhuge fires blazed in the double chimneys, and ten silver sconces,\nreflecting with their bright plates the lights which they supported,\nmade the whole seem as brilliant as day.\n\n“Would you choose any refreshment, Master?” said Sir William Ashton, not\nunwilling to break the awkward silence.\n\nHe received no answer, the Master being so busily engaged in marking the\nvarious changes which had taken place in the apartment, that he\nhardly heard the Lord Keeper address him. A repetition of the offer of\nrefreshment, with the addition, that the family meal would be presently\nready, compelled his attention, and reminded him that he acted a weak,\nperhaps even a ridiculous, part in suffering himself to be overcome\nby the circumstances in which he found himself. He compelled himself,\ntherefore, to enter into conversation with Sir William Ashton, with as\nmuch appearance of indifference as he could well command.\n\n“You will not be surprised, Sir William, that I am interested in the\nchanges you have made for the better in this apartment. In my father's\ntime, after our misfortunes compelled him to live in retirement, it was\nlittle used, except by me as a play-room, when the weather would not\npermit me to go abroad. In that recess was my little workshop, where I\ntreasured the few carpenters' tools which old Caleb procured for me,\nand taught me how to use; there, in yonder corner, under that handsome\nsilver sconce, I kept my fishing-rods and hunting poles, bows and\narrows.”\n\n“I have a young birkie,” said the Lord Keeper, willing to change the\ntone of the conversation, “of much the same turn. He is never happy save\nwhen he is in the field. I wonder he is not here. Here, Lockhard; send\nWilliam Shaw for Mr. Henry. I suppose he is, as usual, tied to Lucy's\napron-string; that foolish girl, Master, draws the whole family after\nher at her pleasure.”\n\nEven this allusion to his daughter, though artfully thrown out, did not\nrecall Ravenswood from his own topic. “We were obliged to leave,” he\nsaid, “some armour and portraits in this apartment; may I ask where they\nhave been removed to?”\n\n“Why,” answered the Keeper, with some hesitation, “the room was fitted\nup in our absence, and cedant arma togae is the maxim of lawyers, you\nknow: I am afraid it has been here somewhat too literally complied with.\nI hope--I believe they are safe, I am sure I gave orders; may I hope\nthat when they are recovered, and put in proper order, you will do\nme the honour to accept them at my hand, as an atonement for their\naccidental derangement?”\n\nThe Master of Ravenswood bowed stiffly, and, with folded arms, again\nresumed his survey of the room.\n\nHenry, a spoilt boy of fifteen, burst into the room, and ran up to\nhis father. “Think of Lucy, papa; she has come home so cross and so\nfractious, that she will not go down to the stable to see my new pony,\nthat Bob Wilson brought from the Mull of Galloway.”\n\n“I think you were very unreasonable to ask her,” said the Keeper.\n\n“Then you are as cross as she is,” answered the boy; “but when mamma\ncomes home, she'll claw up both your mittens.”\n\n“Hush your impertinence, you little forward imp!” said his father;\n“where is your tutor?”\n\n“Gone to a wedding at Dunbar; I hope he'll get a haggis to his dinner”;\nand he began to sing the old Scottish song:\n\n“There was a haggis in Dunbar, Fal de ral, etc. Mony better and few\nwaur, Fal de ral,” etc.\n\n“I am much obliged to Mr. Cordery for his attentions,” said the Lord\nKeeper; “and pray who has had the charge of you while I was away, Mr.\nHenry?”\n\n“Norman and Bob Wilson, forbye my own self.”\n\n“A groom and a gamekeeper, and your own silly self--proper guardians\nfor a young advocate! Why, you will never know any statutes but those\nagainst shooting red-deer, killing salmon, and----”\n\n“And speaking of red-game,” said the young scapegrace, interrupting his\nfather without scruple or hesitation, “Norman has shot a buck, and I\nshowed the branches to Lucy, and she says they have but eight tynes; and\nshe says that you killed a deer with Lord Bittlebrains's hounds, when\nyou were west away, and, do you know, she says it had ten tynes; is it\ntrue?”\n\n“It may have had twenty, Henry, for what I know; but if you go to that\ngentleman, he can tell you all about it. Go speak to him, Henry; it is\nthe Master of Ravenswood.”\n\nWhile they conversed thus, the father and son were standing by the fire;\nand the Master, having walked towards the upper end of the apartment,\nstood with his back towards them, apparently engaged in examining one of\nthe paintings. The boy ran up to him, and pulled him by the skirt of\nthe coat with the freedom of a spoilt child, saying, “I say, sir, if you\nplease to tell me----” but when the Master turned round, and Henry saw\nhis face, he became suddenly and totally disconcerted; walked two or\nthree steps backward, and still gazed on Ravenswood with an air of fear\nand wonder, which had totally banished from his features their usual\nexpression of pert vivacity.\n\n“Come to me, young gentleman,” said the Master, “and I will tell you all\nI know about the hunt.”\n\n“Go to the gentleman, Henry,” said his father; “you are not used to be\nso shy.”\n\nBut neither invitation nor exhortation had any effect on the boy. On the\ncontrary, he turned round as soon as he had completed his survey of the\nMaster, and walking as cautiously as if he had been treading upon eggs,\nhe glided back to his father, and pressed as close to him as possible.\nRavenswood, to avoid hearing the dispute betwixt the father and the\noverindulged boy, thought it most polite to turn his face once more\ntowards the pictures, and pay no attention to what they said.\n\n“Why do you not speak to the Master, you little fool?” said the Lord\nKeeper.\n\n“I am afraid,” said Henry, in a very low tone of voice.\n\n“Afraid, you goose!” said his father, giving him a slight shake by the\ncollar. “What makes you afraid?”\n\n“What makes him to like the picture of Sir Malise Ravenswood then?” said\nthe boy, whispering.\n\n“What picture, you natural?” said his father. “I used to think you only\na scapegrace, but I believe you will turn out a born idiot.”\n\n“I tell you, it is the picture of old Malise of Ravenswood, and he is as\nlike it as if he had loupen out of the canvas; and it is up in the old\nbaron's hall that the maids launder the clothes in; and it has armour,\nand not a coat like the gentleman; and he has not a beard and whiskers\nlike the picture; and it has another kind of thing about the throat, and\nno band-strings as he has; and----”\n\n“And why should not the gentleman be like his ancestor, you silly boy?”\n said the Lord Keeper.\n\n“Ay; but if he is come to chase us all out of the castle,” said the boy,\n“and has twenty men at his back in disguise; and is come to say, with\na hollow voice, 'I bide my time'; and is to kill you on the hearth as\nMalise did the other man, and whose blood is still to be seen!”\n\n“Hush! nonsense!” said the Lord Keeper, not himself much pleased to hear\nthese disagreeable coincidences forced on his notice. “Master, here comes\nLockhard to say supper is served.”\n\nAnd, at the same instant, Lucy entered at another door, having changed\nher dress since her return. The exquisite feminine beauty of her\ncountenance, now shaded only by a profusion of sunny tresses; the\nsylph-like form, disencumbered of her heavy riding-skirt and mantled in\nazure silk; the grace of her manner and of her smile, cleared, with\na celerity which surprised the Master himself, all the gloomy and\nunfavourable thoughts which had for some time overclouded his fancy.\nIn those features, so simply sweet, he could trace no alliance with\nthe pinched visage of the peak-bearded, black-capped Puritan, or his\nstarched, withered spouse, with the craft expressed in the Lord Keeper's\ncountenance, or the haughtiness which predominated in that of his lady;\nand, while he gazed on Lucy Ashton, she seemed to be an angel descended\non earth, unallied to the coarses mortals among whom she deigned to\ndwell for a season. Such is the power of beauty over a youthful and\nenthusiastic fancy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n     I do too ill in this,\n     And must not think but that a parent's plaint\n     Will move the heavens to pour forth misery\n     Upon the head of disobediency.\n     Yet reason tells us, parents are o'erseen,\n     When with too strict a rein they do hold in\n     Their child's affection, and control that love,\n     Which the high powers divine inspire them with.\n\n     The Hog hath lost his Pearl.\n\n\nTHE feast of Ravenswood Castle was as remarkable for its profusion as\nthat of Wolf's Crag had been for its ill-veiled penury. The Lord Keeper\nmight feel internal pride at the contrast, but he had too much tact\nto suffer it to appear. On the contrary, he seemed to remember with\npleasure what he called Mr. Balderstone's bachelor's meal, and to be\nrather disgusted than pleaseed with the display upon his own groaning\nboard.\n\n“We do these things,” he said, “because others do them; but I was bred\na plain man at my father's frugal table, and I should like well would\nmy wife and family permit me to return to my sowens and my\npoor-man-of-mutton.”\n\nThis was a little overstretched. The Master only answered, “That\ndifferent ranks--I mean,” said he, correcting himself, “different\ndegrees of wealth require a different style of housekeeping.”\n\nThis dry remark put a stop to further conversation on the subject, nor\nis it necessary to record that which was substituted in its place. The\nevening was spent with freedom, and even cordiality; and Henry had so\nfar overcome his first apprehensions, that he had settled a party for\ncoursing a stag with the representative and living resemblance of grim\nSir Malise of Ravenswood, called the Revenger. The next morning was the\nappointed time. It rose upon active sportsmen and successful sport. The\nbanquet came in course; and a pressing invitation to tarry yet another\nday was given and accepted. This Ravenswood had resolved should be the\nlast of his stay; but he recollected he had not yet visited the ancient\nand devoted servant of his house, Old Alice, and it was but kind to\ndedicate one morning to the gratification of so ancient an adherent.\n\nTo visit Alice, therefore, a day was devoted, and Lucy was the Master's\nguide upon the way. Henry, it is true, accompanied them, and took from\ntheir walk the air of a tete-a-tete, while, in reality, it was little\nelse, considering the variety of circumstances which occurred to prevent\nthe boy from giving the least attention to what passed between his\ncompanions. Now a rook settled on a branch within shot; anon a hare\ncrossed their path, and Henry and his greyhound went astray in pursuit\nof it; then he had to hold a long conversation with the forester, which\ndetained him a while behind his companions; and again he went to examine\nthe earth of a badger, which carried him on a good way before them.\n\nThe conversation betwixt the Master and his sister, meanwhile, took\nan interesting, and almost a confidential, turn. She could not help\nmentioning her sense of the pain he must feel in visiting scenes so well\nknown to him, bearing now an aspect so different; and so gently was\nher sympathy expressed, that Ravenswood felt it for a moment as a full\nrequital of all his misfortunes. Some such sentiment escaped him, which\nLucy heard with more of confusion than displeasure; and she may be\nforgiven the imprudence of listening to such language, considering that\nthe situation in which she was placed by her father seemed to authorise\nRavenswood to use it. Yet she made an effort to turn the conversation,\nand she succeeded; for the Master also had advanced farther than he\nintended, and his conscience had instantly checked him when he found\nhimself on the verge of speaking of love to the daughter of Sir William\nAshton.\n\nThey now approached the hut of Old Alice, which had of late been\nrendered more comfortable, and presented an appearance less picturesque,\nperhaps, but far neater than before. The old woman was on her accustomed\nseat beneath the weeping birch, basking, with the listless enjoyment of\nage and infirmity, in the beams of the autumn sun. At the arrival of\nher visitors she turned her head towards them. “I hear your step, Miss\nAshton,” she said, “but the gentleman who attends you is not my lord,\nyour father.”\n\n“And why should you think so, Alice?” said Lucy; “or how is it possible\nfor you to judge so accurately by the sound of a step, on this firm\nearth, and in the open air?”\n\n“My hearing, my child, has been sharpened by my blindness, and I can now\ndraw conclusions from the slightest sounds, which formerly reached my\nears as unheeded as they now approach yours. Necessity is a stern but an\nexcellent schoolmistress, and she that has lost her sight must collect\nher information from other sources.”\n\n“Well, you hear a man's step, I grant it,” said Lucy; “but why, Alice,\nmay it not be my father's?”\n\n“The pace of age, my love, is timid and cautious: the foot takes leave\nof the earth slowly, and is planted down upon it with hesitation; it\nis the hasty and determined step of youth that I now hear, and--could I\ngive credit to so strange a thought--I should say is was the step of a\nRavenswood.”\n\n“This is indeed,” said Ravenswood, “an acuteness of organ which I could\nnot have credited had I not witnessed it. I am indeed the Master of\nRavenswood, Alice,--the son of your old master.”\n\n“You!” said the old woman, with almost a scream of surprise--“you the\nMaster of Ravenswood--here--in this place, and thus accompanied! I\ncannot believe it. Let me pass my old hand over your face, that my touch\nmay bear witness to my ears.”\n\nThe Master sate down beside her on the earthen bank, and permitted her\nto touch his features with her trembling hand.\n\n“It is indeed!” she said--“it is the features as well as the voice of\nRavenswood--the high lines of pride, as well as the bold and haughty\ntone. But what do you here, Master of Ravenswood?--what do you in your\nenemy's domain, and in company with his child?” As Old Alice spoke, her\nface kindled, as probably that of an ancient feudal vassal might have\ndone in whose presence his youthful liege-lord had showed some symptom\nof degenerating from the spirit of his ancestors.\n\n“The Master of Ravenswood,” said Lucy, who liked not the tone of this\nexpostulation, and was desirous to abridge it, “is upon a visit to my\nfather.”\n\n“Indeed!” said the old blind woman, in an accent of surprise.\n\n“I knew,” continued Lucy, “I should do him a pleasure by conducting him\nto your cottage.”\n\n“Where, to say the truth, Alice,” said Ravenswood, “I expected a more\ncordial reception.”\n\n“It is most wonderful!” said the old woman, muttering to herself; “but\nthe ways of Heaven are not like our ways, and its judgments are brought\nabout by means far beyond our fathoming. Hearken, young man,” she said;\n“your fathers were implacable, but they were honourable, foes; they\nsought not to ruin their enemies under the mask of hospitality. What\nhave you to do with Lucy Ashton? why should your steps move in the same\nfootpath with hers? why should your voice sound in the same chord and\ntime with those of Sir William Ashton's daughter? Young man, he who aims\nat revenge by dishonourable means----”\n\n“Be silent, woman!” said Ravenswood, sternly; “it is the devil that\nprompts your voice? Know that this young lady has not on earth a friend\nwho would venture farther to save her from injury or from insult.”\n\n“And is it even so?” said the old woman, in an altered but melancholy\ntone, “then God help you both!”\n\n“Amen! Alice,” said Lucy, who had not comprehended the import of what\nthe blind woman had hinted, “and send you your senses, Alice, and your\ngood humour. If you hold this mysterious language, instead of welcoming\nyour friends, they will think of you as other people do.”\n\n“And how do other people think?” said Ravenswood, for he also began to\nbelieve the old woman spoke with incoherence.\n\n“They think,” said Henry Ashton, who came up at that moment, and\nwhispered into Ravenswood's ear, “that she is a witch, that should have\nbeen burned with them that suffered at Haddington.”\n\n“What is it you say?” said Alice, turning towards the boy, her sightless\nvisage inflamed with passion; “that I am a witch, and ought to\nhave suffered with the helpless old wretches who were murdered at\nHaddington?”\n\n“Hear to that now,” again whispered Henry, “and me whispering lower than\na wren cheeps!”\n\n“If the usurer, and the oppressor, and the grinder of the poor man's\nface, and the remover of ancient landmarks, and the subverter of ancient\nhouses, were at the same stake with me, I could say, 'Light the fire, in\nGod's name!'”\n\n“This is dreadful,” said Lucy; “I have never seen the poor deserted\nwoman in this state of mind; but age and poverty can ill bear reproach.\nCome, Henry, we will leave her for the present; she wishes to speak\nwith the Master alone. We will walk homeward, and rest us,” she added,\nlooking at Ravenswood, “by the Mermaiden's Well.” “And Alice,” said the\nboy, “if you know of any hare that comes through among the deer, and\nmakes them drop their calves out of season, you may tell her, with my\ncompliments to command, that if Norman has not got a silver bullet ready\nfor her, I'll lend him one of my doublet-buttons on purpose.”\n\nAlice made no answer till she was aware that the sister and brother were\nout of hearing. She then said to Ravenswood: “And you, too, are angry\nwith me for my love? It is just that strangers should be offended, but\nyou, too, are angry!”\n\n“I am not angry, Alice,” said the Master, “only surprised that you,\nwhose good sense I have heard so often praised, should give way to\noffensive and unfounded suspicions.”\n\n“Offensive!” said Alice. “Ay, trust is ever offensive; but, surely, not\nunfounded.”\n\n“I tell you, dame, most groundless,” replied Ravenswood.\n\n“Then the world has changed its wont, and the Ravenswoods their\nhereditary temper, and the eyes of Old Alice's understanding are yet\nmore blind than those of her countenance. When did a Ravenswood seek the\nhouse of his enemy but with the purpose of revenge? and hither are you\ncome, Edgar Ravenswood, either in fatal anger or in still more fatal\nlove.”\n\n“In neither,” said Ravenswood, “I give you mine honour--I mean, I assure\nyou.”\n\nAlice could not see his blushing cheek, but she noticed his hesitation,\nand that he retracted the pledge which he seemed at first disposed to\nattach to his denial.\n\n“It is so, then,” she said, “and therefore she is to tarry by the\nMermaiden's Well! Often has it been called a place fatal to the race of\nRavenswood--often has it proved so; but never was it likely to verify\nold sayings as much as on this day.”\n\n“You drive me to madness, Alice,” said Ravenswood; “you are more silly\nand more superstitious than old Balderstone. Are you such a wretched\nChristian as to suppose I would in the present day levy war against the\nAshton family, as was the sanguinary custom in elder times? or do you\nsuppose me so foolish, that I cannot walk by a young lady's side without\nplunging headlong in love with her?”\n\n“My thoughts,” replied Alice, “are my own; and if my mortal sight\nis closed to objects present with me, it may be I can look with more\nsteadiness into future events. Are you prepared to sit lowest at the\nboard which was once your father's own, unwillingly, as a connexion and\nally of his proud successor? Are you ready to live on his bounty; to\nfollow him in the bye-paths of intrigue and chicane, which none can\nbetter point out to you; to gnaw the bones of his prey when he has\ndevoured the substance? Can you say as Sir William Ashton says, think\nas he thinks, vote as he votes, and call your father's murderer your\nworshipful father-in-law and revered patron? Master of Ravenswood, I am\nthe eldest servant of your house, and I would rather see you shrouded\nand coffined!”\n\nThe tumult in Ravenswood's mind was uncommonly great; she struck upon\nand awakened a chord which he had for some time successfully silenced.\nHe strode backwards and forwards through the little garden with a hasty\npace; and at length checking himself, and stopping right opposite to\nAlice, he exclaimed: “Woman! on the verge of the grave, dare you urge\nthe son of your master to blood and to revenge?”\n\n“God forbid!” said Alice, solemnly; “and therefore I would have you\ndepart these fatal bounds, where your love, as well as your hatred,\nthreatens sure mischief, or at least disgrace, both to yourself and\nothers. I would shield, were it in the power of this withered hand, the\nAshtons from you, and you from them, and both from their own passions.\nYou can have nothing--ought to have nothing, in common with them. Begone\nfrom among them; and if God has destined vengeance on the oppressor's\nhouse, do not you be the instrument.”\n\n“I will think on what you have said, Alice,” said Ravenswood, more\ncomposedly. “I believe you mean truly and faithfully by me, but you urge\nthe freedom of an ancient domestic somewhat too far. But farewell; and\nif Heaven afford me better means, I will not fail to contribute to your\ncomfort.”\n\nHe attempted to put a piece of gold into her hand, which she refused to\nreceive; and, in the slight struggle attending his wish to force it upon\nher, it dropped to the earth.\n\n“Let it remain an instant on the ground,” said Alice, as the Master\nstooped to raise it; “and believe me, that piece of gold is an emblem of\nher whom you love; she is as precious, I grant, but you must stoop even\nto abasement before you can win her. For me, I have as little to do with\ngold as with earthly passions; and the best news that the world has in\nstore for me is, that Edgar Ravenswood is an hundred miles distant from\nthe seat of his ancestors, with the determination never again to behold\nit.”\n\n“Alice,” said the Master, who began to think this earnestness had some\nmore secret cause than arose from anything that the blind woman could\nhave gathered from this casual visit, “I have heard you praised by my\nmother for your sense, acuteness, and fidelity; you are no fool to start\nat shadows, or to dread old superstitious saws, like Caleb Balderstone;\ntell me distinctly where my danger lies, if you are aware of any which\nis tending towards me. If I know myself, I am free from all such views\nrespecting Miss Ashton as you impute to me. I have necessary business\nto settle with Sir William; that arranged, I shall depart, and with as\nlittle wish, as you may easily believe, to return to a place full of\nmelancholy subjects of reflection, as you have to see me here.” Alice\nbent her sightless eyes on the ground, and was for some time plunged in\ndeep meditation. “I will speak the truth,” she said at length, raising\nup her head--“I will tell you the source of my apprehensions, whether\nmy candour be for good or for evil. Lucy Ashton loves you, Lord of\nRavenswood!”\n\n“It is impossible,” said the Master.\n\n“A thousand circumstances have proved it to me,” replied the blind\nwoman. “Her thoughts have turned on no one else since you saved her\nfrom death, and that my experienced judgment has won from her own\nconversation. Having told you this--if you are indeed a gentleman\nand your father's son--you will make it a motive for flying from her\npresence. Her passion will die like a lamp for want of that the flame\nshould feed upon; but, if you remain here, her destruction, or yours,\nor that of both, will be the inevitable consequence of her misplaced\nattachment. I tell you this secret unwillingly, but it could not have\nbeen hid long from your own observation, and it is better you learn\nit from mine. Depart, Master of Ravenswood; you have my secret. If you\nremain an hour under Sir William Ashton's roof without the resolution\nto marry his daughter, you are a villain; if with the purpose of allying\nyourself with kin, you are an infatuated and predestined fool.”\n\nSo saying, the old blind woman arose, assumed her staff, and, tottering\nto her hut, entered it and closed the door, leaving Ravenswood to his\nown reflections.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n     Lovelier in her own retired abode\n     ....than Naiad by the side\n     Of Grecian brook--or Lady of the Mere\n     Lone sitting by the shores of old romance.\n\n     WORDSWORTH.\n\nTHE meditations of Ravenswood were of a very mixed complexion. He saw\nhimself at once in the very dilemma which he had for some time felt\napprehensive he might be placed in. The pleasure he felt in Lucy's\ncompany had indeed approached to fascination, yet it had never\naltogether surmounted his internal reluctance to wed with the daughter\nof his father's foe; and even in forgiving Sir William Ashton the\ninjuries which his family had received, and giving him credit for the\nkind intentions he professed to entertain, he could not bring himself to\ncontemplate as possible an alliance betwixt their houses. Still, he felt\nthat Alice poke truth, and that his honour now required he should\ntake an instant leave of Ravenswood Castle, or become a suitor of Lucy\nAshton. The possibility of being rejected, too, should he make advances\nto her wealthy and powerful father--to sue for the hand of an Ashton and\nbe refused--this were a consummation too disgraceful. “I wish her well,”\n he said to himself, “and for her sake I forgive the injuries her father\nhas done to my house; but I will never--no, never see her more!”\n\nWith one bitter pang he adopted this resolution, just as he came to\nwhere two paths parted: the one to the Mermaiden's Fountain, where he\nknew Lucy waited him, the other leading to the castle by another and\nmore circuitous road. He paused an instant when about to take the latter\npath, thinking what apology he should make for conduct which must needs\nseem extraordinary, and had just muttered to himself, “Sudden news from\nEdinburgh--any pretext will serve; only let me dally no longer here,”\n when young Henry came flying up to him, half out of breath: “Master,\nMaster you must give Lucy your arm back to the castle, for I cannot give\nher mine; for Norman is waiting for me, and I am to go with him to make\nhis ring-walk, and I would not stay away for a gold Jacobus; and Lucy is\nafraid to walk home alone, though all the wild nowt have been shot, and\nso you must come away directly.”\n\nBetwixt two scales equally loaded, a feather's weight will turn the\nscale. “It is impossible for me to leave the young lady in the wood\nalone,” said Ravenswood; “to see her once more can be of little\nconsequence, after the frequent meetings we have had. I ought, too, in\ncourtesy, to apprise her of my intention to quit the castle.”\n\nAnd having thus satisfied himself that he was taking not only a wise,\nbut an absolutely necessary, step, he took the path to the fatal\nfountain. Henry no sooner saw him on the way to join his sister than he\nwas off like lightning in another direction, to enjoy the society of the\nforester in their congenial pursuits. Ravenswood, not allowing himself\nto give a second thought to the propriety of his own conduct, walked\nwith a quick step towards the stream, where he found Lucy seated alone\nby the ruin.\n\nShe sate upon one of the disjointed stones of the ancient fountain,\nand seemed to watch the progress of its current, as it bubbled forth to\ndaylight, in gay and sparkling profusion, from under the shadow of the\nribbed and darksome vault, with which veneration, or perhaps remorse,\nhad canopied its source. To a superstitious eye, Lucy Ashton, folded in\nher plaided mantle, with her long hair, escaping partly from the snood\nand falling upon her silver neck, might have suggested the idea of\nthe murdered Nymph of the fountain. But Ravenswood only saw a female\nexquisitely beautiful, and rendered yet more so in his eyes--how\ncould it be otherwise?--by the consciousness that she had placed her\naffections on him. As he gazed on her, he felt his fixed resolution\nmelting like wax in the sun, and hastened, therefore, from his\nconcealment in the neighbouring thicket. She saluted him, but did not\narise from the stone on which she was seated.\n\n“My madcap brother,” she said, “has left me, but I expect him back in\na few minutes; for, fortunately, as anything pleases him for a minute,\nnothing has charms for him much longer.”\n\nRavenswood did not feel the power of informing Lucy that her brother\nmeditated a distant excursion, and would not return in haste. He sate\nhimself down on the grass, at some little distance from Miss Ashton, and\nboth were silent for a short space.\n\n“I like this spot,” said Lucy at length, as if she found the silence\nembarrassing; “the bubbling murmur of the clear fountain, the waving of\nthe trees, the profusion of grass and wild-flowers that rise among the\nruins, make it like a scene in romance. I think, too, I have heard it is\na spot connected with the legendary lore which I love so well.”\n\n“It has been thought,” answered Ravenswood, “a fatal spot to my family;\nand I have some reason to term it so, for it was here I first saw Miss\nAshton; and it is here I must take my leave of her for ever.”\n\nThe blood, which the first part of this speech called into Lucy's\ncheeks, was speedily expelled by its conclusion.\n\n“To take leave of us, Master!” she exclaimed; “what can have happened\nto hurry you away? I know Alice hates--I mean dislikes my father; and\nI hardly understood her humour to-day, it was so mysterious. But I\nam certain my father is sincerely grateful for the high service you\nrendered us. Let me hope that, having won your friendship hardly, we\nshall not lose it lightly.”\n\n“Lose it, Miss Ashton!” said the Master of Ravenswood. “No; wherever my\nfortune calls me--whatever she inflicts upon me--it is your friend--your\nsincere friend, who acts or suffers. But there is a fate on me, and I\nmust go, or I shall add the ruin of others to my own.”\n\n“Yet do not go from us, Master,” said Lucy; and she laid her hand,\nin all simplicity and kindness, upon the skirt of his cloak, as if to\ndetain him. “You shall not part from us. My father is powerful, he has\nfriends that are more so than himself; do not go till you see what his\ngratitude will do for you. Believe me, he is already labouring in your\nbehalf with the council.”\n\n“It may be so,” said the Master, proudly; “yet it is not to your father,\nMiss Ashton, but to my own exertions, that I ought to owe success in the\ncareer on which I am about to enter. My preparations are already made--a\nsword and a cloak, and a bold heart and a determined hand.”\n\nLucy covered her face her hands, and the tears, in spite of her, forced\ntheir way between her fingers.\n\n“Forgive me,” said Ravenswood, taking her right hand, which, after\nslight resistance, she yielded to him, still continuing to shade her\nface with the left--“I am too rude--too rough--too intractable to deal\nwith any being so soft and gentle as you are. Forget that so stern a\nvision has crossed your path of life; and let me pursue mine, sure that\nI can meet with no worse misfortune after the moment it divides me from\nyour side.”\n\nLucy wept on, but her tears were less bitter. Each attempt which the\nMaster made to explain his purpose of departure only proved a new\nevidence of his desire to stay; until, at length, instead of bidding her\nfarewell, he gave his faith to her for ever, and received her troth\nin return. The whole passed so suddenly, and arose so much out of the\nimmediate impulse of the moment, that ere the Master of Ravenswood could\nreflect upon the consequences of the step which he had taken, their\nlips, as well as their hands, had pledged the sincerity of their\naffection.\n\n“And now,” he said, after a moment's consideration, “it is fit I should\nspeak to Sir William Ashton; he must know of our engagement. Ravenswood\nmust not seem to dwell under his roof to solicit clandestinely the\naffections of his daughter.”\n\n“You would not speak to my father on the subject?” said Lucy,\ndoubtingly; and then added more warmly: “Oh do not--do not! Let your lot\nin life be determined--your station and purpose ascertained, before you\naddress my father. I am sure he loves you--I think he will consent; but\nthen my mother----!”\n\nShe paused, ashamed to express the doubt she felt how far her father\ndared to form any positive resolution on this most important subject\nwithout the consent of his lady.\n\n“Your mother, my Lucy!” replied Ravenswood. “She is of the house of\nDouglas, a house that has intermarried with mine even when its glory\nand power were at the highest; what could your mother object to my\nalliance?”\n\n“I did not say object,” said Lucy; “but she is jealous of her rights,\nand may claim a mother's title to be consulted in the first instance.”\n\n“Be it so,” replied Ravenswood. “London is distant, but a letter will\nreach it and receive an answer within a fortnight; I will not press on\nthe Lord Keeper for an instant reply to my proposal.”\n\n“But,” hesitated Lucy, “were it not better to wait--to wait a few weeks?\nWere my mother to see you--to know you, I am sure she would approve;\nbut you are unacquainted personally, and the ancient feud between the\nfamilies----”\n\nRavenswood fixed upon her his keen dark eyes, as if he was desirous of\npenetrating into her very soul.\n\n“Lucy,” he said, “I have sacrificed to you projects of vengeance long\nnursed, and sworn to with ceremonies little better than heathen--I\nsacrificed them to your image, ere I knew the worth which it\nrepresented. In the evening which succeeded my poor father's funeral, I\ncut a lock from my hair, and, as it consumed in the fire, I swore that\nmy rage and revenge should pursue his enemies, until they shrivelled\nbefore me like that scorched-up symbol of annihilation.”\n\n“It was a deadly sin,” said Lucy, turning pale, “to make a vow so\nfatal.”\n\n“I acknowledge it,” said Ravenswood, “and it had been a worse crime\nto keep it. It was for your sake that I abjured these purposes of\nvengeance, though I scarce knew that such was the argument by which I\nwas conquered, until I saw you once more, and became conscious of the\ninfluence you possessed over me.”\n\n“And why do you now,” said Lucy, “recall sentiments so\nterrible--sentiments so inconsistent with those you profess for me--with\nthose your importunity has prevailed on me to acknowledge?”\n\n“Because,” said her lover, “I would impress on you the price at which I\nhave bought your love--the right I have to expect your constancy. I\nsay not that I have bartered for it the honour of my house, its last\nremaining possession; but though I say it not, and think it not, I\ncannot conceal from myself that the world may do both.”\n\n“If such are your sentiments,” said Lucy, “you have played a cruel game\nwith me. But it is not too late to give it over: take back the faith and\ntroth which you could not plight to me without suffering abatement of\nhonour--let what is passed be as if it had not been--forget me; I will\nendeavour to forget myself.”\n\n“You do me injustice,” said the Master of Ravenswood--“by all I\nhold true and honourable, you do me the extremity of injustice; if I\nmentioned the price at which I have bought your love, it is only to show\nhow much I prize it, to bind our engagement by a still firmer tie, and\nto show, by what I have done to attain this station in your regard, how\nmuch I must suffer should you ever break your faith.”\n\n“And why, Ravenswood,” answered Lucy, “should you think that possible?\nWhy should you urge me with even the mention of infidelity? Is it\nbecause I ask you to delay applying to my father for a little space of\ntime? Bind me by what vows you please; if vows are unnecessary to\nsecure constancy, they may yet prevent suspicion.” Ravenswood pleaded,\napologised, and even kneeled, to appease her displeasure; and Lucy, as\nplacable as she was single-hearted, readily forgave the offence which\nhis doubts had implied. The dispute thus agitated, however, ended by the\nlovers going through an emblematic ceremony of their troth-plight, of\nwhich the vulgar still preserve some traces. They broke betwixt them\nthe thin broad-piece of gold which Alice had refused to receive from\nRavenswood.\n\n“And never shall this leave my bosom,” said Lucy, as she hung the piece\nof gold round her neck, and concealed it with her handkerchief, “until\nyou, Edgar Ravenswood, ask me to resign it to you; and, while I wear it,\nnever shall that heart acknowledge another love than yours.”\n\nWith like protestations, Ravenswood placed his portion of the coin\nopposite to his heart. And now, at length, it struck them that time had\nhurried fast on during this interview, and their absence at the castle\nwould be subject of remark, if not of alarm. As they arose to leave the\nfountain which had been witness of their mutual engagement, an arrow\nwhistled through the air, and struck a raven perched on the sere branch\nof an old oak, near to where they had been seated. The bird fluttered a\nfew yards and dropped at the feet of Lucy, whose dress was stained with\nsome spots of its blood.\n\nMiss Ashton was much alarmed, and Ravenswood, surprised and angry,\nlooked everywhere for the marksman, who had given them a proof of his\nskill as little expected as desired. He was not long of discovering\nhimself, being no other than Henry Ashton, who came running up with a\ncrossbow in his hand.\n\n“I knew I should startle you,” he said; “and do you know, you looked so\nbusy that I hoped it would have fallen souse on your heads before you\nwere aware of it. What was the Master saying to you, Lucy?”\n\n“I was telling your sister what an idle lad you were, keeping us waiting\nhere for you so long,” said Ravenswood, to save Lucy's confusion.\n\n“Waiting for me! Why, I told you to see Lucy home, and that I was to go\nto make the ring-walk with old Norman in the Hayberry thicket, and you\nmay be sure that would take a good hour, and we have all the deer's\nmarks and furnishes got, while you were sitting here with Lucy, like a\nlazy loon.”\n\n“Well, well, Mr. Henry,” said Ravenswood; “but let us see how you will\nanswer to me for killing the raven. Do you know, the ravens are all\nunder the protection of the Lords of Ravenswood, and to kill one in\ntheir presence is such bad luck that it deserves the stab?”\n\n“And that's what Norman said,” replied the boy; “he came as far with\nme as within a flight-shot of you, and he said he never saw a raven sit\nstill so near living folk, and he wished it might be for good luck, for\nthe raven is one of the wildest birds that flies, unless it be a tame\none; and so I crept on and on, till I was within threescore yards of\nhim, and then whiz went the bolt, and there he lies, faith! Was it not\nwell shot? and, I dare say, I have not shot in a crossbow!--not ten\ntimes, maybe.”\n\n“Admirably shot, indeed,” said Ravenswood; “and you will be a fine\nmarksman if you practise hard.”\n\n“And that's what Norman says,” answered the boy; “but I am sure it is\nnot my fault if I do not practise enough; for, of free will, I would do\nlittle else, only my father and tutor are angry sometimes, and only Miss\nLucy there gives herself airs about my being busy, for all she can\nsit idle by a well-side the whole day, when she has a handsome young\ngentleman to prate with. I have known her do so twenty times, if you\nwill believe me.”\n\nThe boy looked at his sister as he spoke, and, in the midst of his\nmischievous chatter, had the sense to see that he was really inflicting\npain upon her, though without being able to comprehend the cause or the\namount.\n\n“Come now, Lucy,” he said, “don't greet; and if I have said anything\nbeside the mark, I'll deny it again; and what does the Master of\nRavenswood care if you had a hundred sweethearts? so ne'er put finger in\nyour eye about it.”\n\nThe Master of Ravenswood was, for the moment, scarce satisfied with what\nhe heard; yet his good sense naturally regarded it as the chatter of a\nspoilt boy, who strove to mortify his sister in the point which seemed\nmost accessible for the time. But, although of a temper equally slow in\nreceiving impressions and obstinate in retaining them, the prattle\nof Henry served to nourish in his mind some vague suspicion that his\npresent engagement might only end in his being exposed, like a conquered\nenemy in a Roman triumph, a captive attendant on the car of a victor who\nmeditated only the satiating his pride at the expense of the\nvanquished. There was, we repeat it, no real ground whatever for such\nan apprehension, nor could he be said seriously to entertain such for a\nmoment. Indeed, it was impossible to look at the clear blue eye of\nLucy Ashton, and entertain the slightest permanent doubt concerning\nthe sincerity of her disposition. Still, however, conscious pride and\nconscious poverty combined to render a mind suspicious which in more\nfortunate circumstances would have been a stranger to that as well as to\nevery other meanness.\n\nThey reached the castle, where Sir William Ashton, who had been alarmed\nby the length of their stay, met them in the hall.\n\n“Had Lucy,” he said, “been in any other company than that of one who had\nshown he had so complete power of protecting her, he confessed he should\nhave been very uneasy, and would have despatched persons in quest of\nthem. But, in the company of the Master of Ravenswood, he knew his\ndaughter had nothing to dread.” Lucy commenced some apology for their\nlong delay, but, conscience-struck, becames confused as she proceeded;\nand when Ravenswood, coming to her assistance, endeavoured to render the\nexplanation complete and satisfactory, he only involved himself in the\nsame disorder, like one who, endeavouring to extricate his companion\nfrom a slough, entangles himself in the same tenacious swamp. It cannot\nbe supposed that the confusion of the two youthful lovers escaped the\nobservation of the subtle lawyer, accustomed, by habit and profession,\nto trace human nature through all her windings. But it was not his\npresent policy to take any notice of what he observed. He desired to\nhold the Master of Ravenswood bound, but wished that he himself should\nremain free; and it did not occur to him that his plan might be defeated\nby Lucy's returning the passion which he hoped she might inspire. If\nshe should adopt some romantic feelings towards Ravenswood, in which\ncircumstances, or the positive and absolute opposition of Lady Ashton,\nmight render it unadvisable to indulge her, the Lord Keeper conceived\nthey might be easily superseded and annulled by a journey to Edinburgh,\nor even to London, a new set of Brussels lace, and the soft whispers of\nhalf a dozen lovers, anxious to replace him whom it was convenient she\nshould renounce. This was his provision for the worst view of the case.\nBut, according to its more probable issue, any passing favours she\nmight entertain for the Master of Ravenswood might require encouragement\nrather than repression.\n\nThis seemed the more likely, as he had that very morning, since their\ndeparture from the castle, received a letter, the contents of which he\nhastened to communicate to Ravenswood. A foot-post had arrived with\na packet to the Lord Keeper from that friend whom we have already\nmentioned, who was labouring hard underhand to consolidate a band of\npatriots, at the head of whom stood Sir William's greatest terror, the\nactive and ambitious Marquis of A----. The success of this convenient\nfriend had been such, that he had obtained from Sir William, not indeed\na directly favourable answer, but certainly a most patient hearing. This\nhe had reported to his principal, who had replied by the ancient French\nadage, “Chateau qui parle, et femme qui ecoute, l'un et l'autre va se\nrendre.” A statesman who hears you propose a change of measures without\nreply was, according to the Marquis's opinion, in the situation of the\nfortress which parleys and the lady who listens, and he resolved to\npress the siege of the Lord Keeper.\n\nThe packet, therefore, contained a letter from his friend and ally,\nand another from himself, to the Lord Keeper, frankly offering an\nunceremonious visit. They were crossing the country to go to the\nsouthward; the roads were indifferent; the accommodation of the inns\nas execrable as possible; the Lord Keeper had been long acquainted\nintimately with one of his correspondents, and, though more slightly\nknown to the Marquis, had yet enough of his lordship's acquaintance to\nrender the visit sufficiently natural, and to shut the mouths of those\nwho might be disposed to impute it to a political intrigue. He instantly\naccepted the offered visit, determined, however, that he would not\npledge himself an inch farther for the furtherance of their views than\nREASON (by which he meant his own self-interest) should plainly point\nout to him as proper.\n\nTwo circumstances particularly delighted him--the presence of\nRavenswood, and the absence of his own lady. By having the former under\nhis roof, he conceived he might be able to quash all such hazardous and\nhostile proceedings as he might otherwise have been engaged in, under\nthe patronage of the Marquis; and Lucy, he foresaw, would make, for his\nimmediate purpose of delay and procrastination, a much better mistress\nof his family than her mother, who would, he was sure, in some shape\nor other, contrive to disconcert his political schemes by her proud and\nimplacable temper.\n\nHis anxious solicitations that the Master would stay to receive\nhis kinsman, were, of course, readily complied with, since the\neclaircissement which had taken place at the Mermaiden's Fountain\nhad removed all wish for sudden departure. Lucy and Lockhard, had,\ntherefore, orders to provide all things necessary in their different\ndepartments, for receiving the expected guests with a pomp and display\nof luxury very uncommon in Scotland at that remote period.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n     Marall: Sir, the man of honour's come,\n     Newly alighted----Overreach: In without reply,\n     And do as I command....\n     Is the loud music I gave order for\n     Ready to receive him?\n\n     New Way to pay Old Debts.\n\nSIR WILLIAM ASHTON, although a man of sense, legal information, and\ngreat practical knowledge of the world, had yet some points of character\nwhich corresponded better with the timidity of his disposition and the\nsupple arts by which he had risen in the world, than to the degree\nof eminence which he had attained; as they tended to show an original\nmediocrity of understanding, however highly it had been cultivated, and\na native meanness of disposition, however carefully veiled. He loved the\nostentatious display of his wealth, less as a man to whom habit has\nmade it necessary, than as one to whom it is still delightful from its\nnovelty. The most trivial details did not escape him; and Lucy soon\nlearned to watch the flush of scorn which crossed Ravenswood's cheek,\nwhen he heard her father gravely arguing with Lockhard, nay, even with\nthe old housekeeper, upon circumstances which, in families of rank,\nare left uncared for, because it is supposed impossible they can be\nneglected.\n\n“I could pardon Sir William,” said Ravenswood, one evening after he\nhad left the room, “some general anxiety upon this occasion, for the\nMarquis's visit is an honour, and should be received as such; but I am\nworn out by these miserable minutiae of the buttery, and the larder,\nand the very hencoop--they drive me beyond my patience; I would rather\nendure the poverty of Wolf's Crag than be pestered with the wealth of\nRavenswood Castle.”\n\n“And yet,” said Lucy, “it was by attention to these minutiae that my\nfather acquired the property----”\n\n“Which my ancestors sold for lack of it,” replied Ravenswood. “Be it so;\na porter still bears but a burden, though the burden be of gold.”\n\nLucy sighed; she perceived too plainly that her lover held in scorn the\nmanners and habits of a father to whom she had long looked up as her\nbest and most partial friend, whose fondness had often consoled her for\nher mother's contemptuous harshness.\n\nThe lovers soon discovered that they differed upon other and no less\nimportant topics. Religion, the mother of peace, was, in those days of\ndiscord, so much misconstrued and mistaken, that her rules and forms\nwere the subject of the most opposite opinions and the most hostile\nanimosities. The Lord Keeper, being a Whig, was, of course, a\nPresbyterian, and had found it convenient, at different periods, to\nexpress greater zeal for the kirk than perhaps he really felt. His\nfamily, equally of course, were trained under the same institution.\nRavenswood, as we know, was a High Churchman, or Episcopalian, and\nfrequently objected to Lucy the fanaticism of some of her own\ncommunion, while she intimated, rather than expressed, horror at the\nlatitudinarian principles which she had been taught to think connected\nwith the prelatical form of church government.\n\nThus, although their mutual affection seemed to increase rather than to\nbe diminished as their characters opened more fully on each other, the\nfeelings of each were mingled with some less agreeable ingredients. Lucy\nfelt a secret awe, amid all her affection for Ravenswood. His soul was\nof an higher, prouder character than those with whom she had hitherto\nmixed in intercourse; his ideas were more fierce and free; and he\ncontemned many of the opinions which had been inculcated upon her as\nchiefly demanding her veneration. On the other hand, Ravenswood saw in\nLucy a soft and flexible character, which, in his eyes at least, seemed\ntoo susceptible of being moulded to any form by those with whom\nshe lived. He felt that his own temper required a partner of a more\nindependent spirit, who could set sail with him on his course of life,\nresolved as himself to dare indifferently the storm and the favouring\nbreeze. But Lucy was so beautiful, so devoutly attached to him, of a\ntemper so exquisitely soft and kind, that, while he could have wished\nit were possible to inspire her with a greater degree of firmness and\nresolution, and while he sometimes became impatient of the extreme fear\nwhich she expressed of their attachment being prematurely discovered,\nhe felt that the softness of a mind, amounting almost to feebleness,\nrendered her even dearer to him, as a being who had voluntarily clung\nto him for protection, and made him the arbiter of her fate for weal or\nwoe. His feelings towards her at such moments were those which have been\nsince so beautifully expressed by our immortal Joanna Baillie:\n\n     Thou sweetest thing,\n     That e'er did fix its lightly-fibred sprays\n     To the rude rock, ah! wouldst thou cling to me?\n     Rough and storm-worn I am; yet love me as\n     Thou truly dost, I will love thee again\n     With true and honest heart, though all unmeet\n     To be the mate of such sweet gentleness.\n\nThus the very points in which they differed seemed, in some measure, to\nensure the continuance of their mutual affection. If, indeed, they had\nso fully appreciated each other's character before the burst of passion\nin which they hastily pledged their faith to each other, Lucy might have\nfeared Ravenswood too much ever to have loved him, and he might have\nconstrued her softness and docile temper as imbecility, rendering her\nunworthy of his regard. But they stood pledged to each other; and Lucy\nonly feared that her lover's pride might one day teach him to regret\nhis attachment; Ravenswood, that a mind so ductile as Lucy's might, in\nabsence or difficulties, be induced, by the entreaties or influence of\nthose around her, to renounce the engagement she had formed.\n\n“Do not fear it,” said Lucy, when upon one occasion a hint of such\nsuspicion escaped her lover; “the mirrors which receive the reflection\nof all successive objects are framed of hard materials like glass or\nsteel; the softer substances, when they receive an impression, retain it\nundefaced.”\n\n“This is poetry, Lucy,” said Ravenswood; “and in poetry there is always\nfallacy, and sometimes fiction.”\n\n“Believe me, then, once more, in honest prose,” said Lucy, “that, though\nI will never wed man without the consent of my parents, yet neither\nforce nor persuasion shall dispose of my hand till you renounce the\nright I have given you to it.”\n\nThe lovers had ample time for such explanations. Henry was now more\nseldom their companion, being either a most unwilling attendant upon the\nlessons of his tutor, or a forward volunteer under the instructions of\nthe foresters or grooms. As for the Keeper, his mornings were spent in\nhis study, maintaining correspondences of all kinds, and balancing in\nhis anxious mind the various intelligence which he collected from every\nquarter concerning the expected change of Scottish politics, and the\nprobable strength of the parties who were about to struggle for power.\nAt other times he busied himself about arranging, and countermanding, and\nthen again arranging, the preparations which he judged necessary for the\nreception of the Marquis of A----, whose arrival had been twice delayed\nby some necessary cause of detention.\n\nIn the midst of all these various avocations, political and domestic,\nhe seemed not to observe how much his daughter and his guest were thrown\ninto each other's society, and was censured by many of his neighbours,\naccording to the fashion of neighbours in all countries, for suffering\nsuch an intimate connexion to take place betwixt two young persons.\nThe only natural explanation was, that he designed them for each other;\nwhile, in truth, his only motive was to temporise and procrastinate\nuntil he should discover the real extent of the interest which the\nMarquis took in Ravenswood's affairs, and the power which he was likely\nto possess of advancing them. Until these points should be made both\nclear and manifest, the Lord Keeper resolved that he would do nothing\nto commit himself, either in one shape or other; and, like many cunning\npersons, he overreached himself deplorably.\n\nAmongst those who had been disposed to censure, with the greatest\nseverity, the conduct of Sir William Ashton, in permitting the prolonged\nresidence of Ravenswood under his roof, and his constant attendance on\nMiss Ashton, was the new Laird of Girnington, and his faithful squire\nand bottleholder, personages formerly well known to us by the names of\nHayston and Bucklaw, and his companion Captain Craigengelt. The former\nhad at length succeeded to the extensive property of his long-lived\ngrand-aunt, and to considerable wealth besides, which he had employed\nin redeeming his paternal acres (by the title appertaining to which he\nstill chose to be designated), notwithstanding Captain Craigengelt had\nproposed to him a most advantageous mode of vesting the money in Law's\nscheme, which was just then broached, and offered his services to travel\nexpress to Paris for the purpose. But Bucklaw had so far derived wisdom\nfrom adversity, that he would listen to no proposal which Craigengelt\ncould invent, which had the slightest tendency to risk his\nnewly-acquired independence. He that had once eat pease-bannocks, drank\nsour wine, and slept in the secret chamber at Wolf's Crag, would, he\nsaid, prize good cheer and a soft bed as long as he lived, and take\nspecial care never to need such hospitality again.\n\nCraigengelt, therefore, found himself disappointed in the first hopes\nhe had entertained of making a good hand of the Laird of Bucklaw. Still,\nhowever, he reaped many advantages from his friend's good fortune.\nBucklaw, who had never been at all scrupulous in choosing his\ncompanions, was accustomed to, and entertained by, a fellow whom he\ncould either laugh with or laugh at as he had a mind, who would take,\naccording to Scottish phrase, “the bit and the buffet,” understood all\nsports, whether within or without doors, and, when the laird had a mind\nfor a bottle of wine (no infrequent circumstance), was always ready to\nsave him from the scandal of getting drunk by himself. Upon these terms,\nCraigengelt was the frequent, almost the constant, inmate of the house\nof Girnington.\n\nIn no time, and under no possibility of circumstances, could good have\nbeen derived from such an intimacy, however its bad consequences might\nbe qualified by the thorough knowledge which Bucklaw possessed of his\ndependant's character, and the high contempt in which he held it. But,\nas circumstances stood, this evil communication was particularly liable\nto corrupt what good principles nature had implanted in the patron.\n\nCraigengelt had never forgiven the scorn with which Ravenswood had torn\nthe mask of courage and honesty from his countenance; and to exasperate\nBucklaw's resentment against him was the safest mode of revenge which\noccurred to his cowardly, yet cunning and malignant, disposition.\n\nHe brought up on all occasions the story of the challenge which\nRavenswood had declined to accept, and endeavoured, by every possible\ninsinuation, to make his patron believe that his honour was concerned\nin bringing that matter to an issue by a present discussion with\nRavenswood. But respecting this subject Bucklaw imposed on him, at\nlength, a peremptory command of silence.\n\n“I think,” he said, “the Master has treated me unlike a gentleman, and\nI see no right he had to send me back a cavalier answer when I demanded\nthe satisfaction of one. But he gave me my life once; and, in looking\nthe matter over at present, I put myself but on equal terms with him.\nShould he cross me again, I shall consider the old accompt as balanced,\nand his Mastership will do well to look to himself.”\n\n“That he should,” re-echoed Craigengelt; “for when you are in practice,\nBucklaw, I would bet a magnum you are through him before the third\npass.”\n\n“Then you know nothing of the matter,” said Bucklaw, “and you never saw\nhim fence.”\n\n“And I know nothing of the matter?” said the dependant--“a good jest, I\npromise you! And though I never saw Ravenswood fence, have I not been at\nMonsieur Sagoon's school, who was the first maitre d'armes at Paris;\nand have I not been at Signor Poco's at Florence, and Meinheer\nDurchstossen's at Vienna, and have I not seen all their play?”\n\n“I don't know whether you have or not,” said Bucklaw; “but what about\nit, though you had?”\n\n“Only that I will be d--d if ever I saw French, Italian, or\nHigh-Dutchman ever make foot, hand, and eye keep time half so well as\nyou, Bucklaw.”\n\n“I believe you lie, Craigie,” said Bucklaw; “however, I can hold my own,\nboth with single rapier, backsword, sword and dagger, broadsword, or\ncase of falchions--and that's as much as any gentleman need know of the\nmatter.”\n\n“And the doubt of what ninety-nine out of a hundred know,” said\nCraigengelt; “they learn to change a few thrusts with the small sword,\nand then, forsooth, they understand the noble art of defence! Now, when\nI was at Rouen in the year 1695, there was a Chevalier de Chapon and I\nwent to the opera, where we found three bits of English birkies----” “Is\nit a long story you are going to tell?” said Bucklaw, interrupting him\nwithout ceremony.\n\n“Just as you like,” answered the parasite, “for we made short work of\nit.”\n\n“Then I like it short,” said Bucklaw. “Is it serious or merry?”\n\n“Devilish serious, I assure you, and so they found it; for the Chevalier\nand I----”\n\n“Then I don't like it at all,” said Bucklaw; “so fill a brimmer of\nmy auld auntie's claret, rest her heart! And, as the Hielandman says,\nSkioch doch na skiall.”\n\n“That was what tough old Sir Even Dhu used to say to me when I was out\nwith the metall'd lads in 1689. 'Craigengelt,' he used to say, 'you\nare as pretty a fellow as ever held steel in his grip, but you have one\nfault.'”\n\n“If he had known you as long as I have don,” said Bucklaw, “he would\nhave found out some twenty more; but hand long stories, give us your\ntoast, man.”\n\nCraigengelt rose, went a-tiptoe to the door, peeped out, shut it\ncarefully, came back again, clapped his tarnished gold-laced hat on one\nside of his head, took his glass in one hand, and touching the hilt of\nhis hanger with the other, named, “The King over the water.”\n\n“I tell you what it is, Captain Craigengelt,” said Bucklaw; “I shall\nkeep my mind to myself on thse subjects, having too much respect for the\nmemory of my venerable Aunt Girnington to put her lands and tenements\nin the way of committing treason against established authority. Bring me\nKing James to Edinburgh, Captain, with thirty thousand men at his back,\nand I'll tell you what I think about his title; but as for running my\nneck into a noose, and my good broad lands into the statutory penalties,\n'in that case made and provided,' rely upon it, you will find me no such\nfool. So, when you mean to vapour with your hanger and your dram-cup\nin support of treasonable toasts, you must find your liquor and company\nelsewhere.”\n\n“Well, then,” said Craigengelt, “name the toast yourself, and be it what\nit like, I'll pledge you, were it a mile to the bottom.”\n\n“And I'll give you a toast that deserves it, my boy,” said Bucklaw;\n“what say you to Miss Lucy Ashton?”\n\n“Up with it,” said the Captain, as he tossed off his brimmer, “the\nbonniest lass in Lothian! What a pity the old sneckdrawing Whigamore,\nher father, is about to throw her away upon that rag of pride and\nbeggary, the Master of Ravenswood!”\n\n“That's not quite so clear,” said Bucklaw, in a tone which, though it\nseemed indifferent, excited his companion's eager curiosity; and not\nthat only, but also his hope of working himself into some sort of\nconfidence, which might make him necessary to his patron, being by no\nmeans satisfied to rest on mere sufferance, if he could form by art or\nindustry a more permanent title to his favour.\n\n“I thought,” said he, after a moment's pause, “that was a settled\nmatter; they are continually together, and nothing else is spoken of\nbetwixt Lammer Law and Traprain.”\n\n“They may say what they please,” replied his patron, “but I know better;\nand I'll give you Miss Lucy Ashton's health again, my boy.”\n\n“And I woul drink it on my knee,” said Craigengelt, “if I thought the\ngirl had the spirit to jilt that d--d son of a Spaniard.”\n\n“I am to request you will not use the word 'jilt' and Miss Ashton's name\ntogether,” said Bucklaw, gravely.\n\n“Jilt, did I say? Discard, my lad of acres--by Jove, I meant to\ndiscard,” replied Craigengelt; “and I hope she'll discard him like\na small card at piquet, and take in the king of hearts, my boy! But\nyet----”\n\n“But what?” said his patron.\n\n“But yet I know for certain they are hours together alone, and in the\nwoods and the fields.”\n\n“That's her foolish father's dotage; that will be soon put out of the\nlass's head, if it ever gets into it,” answered Bucklaw. “And now fill\nyour glass again, Captain; I am going to make you happy; I am going to\nlet you into a secret--a plot--a noosing plot--only the noose is but\ntypical.”\n\n“A marrying matter?” said Craigengelt, and his jaw fell as he asked the\nquestion, for he suspected that matrimony would render his situation\nat Girnington much more precarious than during the jolly days of his\npatron's bachelorhood.\n\n“Ay, a marriage, man,” said Bucklaw; “but wherefore droops thy mighty\nspirit, and why grow the rubies on they cheek so pale? The board will\nhave a corner, and the corner will have a trencher, and the trencher\nwill have a glass beside it; and the board-end shall be filled, and\nthe trencher and the glass shall be replenished for thee, if all the\npetticoats in Lothian had sworn the contrary. What, man! I am not the\nboy to put myself into leading-strings.”\n\n“So says many an honest fellow,” said Craigengelt, “and some of my\nspecial friends; but, curse me if I know the reason, the women could\nnever bear me, and always contrived to trundle me out of favour before\nthe honeymoon was over.”\n\n“If you could have kept your ground till that was over, you might have\nmade a good year's pension,” said Bucklaw.\n\n“But I never could,” answered the dejected parasite. “There was my Lord\nCastle-Cuddy--we were hand and glove: I rode his horses, borrowed money\nboth for him and from him, trained his hawks, and taught him how to lay\nhis bets; and when he took a fancy of marrying, I married him to Katie\nGlegg, whom I thought myself as sure of as man could be of woman. Egad,\nshe had me out of the house, as if I had run on wheels, within the first\nfortnight!”\n\n“Well!” replied Bucklaw, “I think I have nothing of Castle-Cuddy about\nme, or Lucy of Katie Glegg. But you see the thing will go on whether you\nlike it or no; the only question is, will you be useful?”\n\n“Useful!” exclaimed the Captain, “and to thee, my lad of lands, my\ndarling boy, whom I would tramp barefooted through the world for! Name\ntime, place, mode, and circumstances, and see if I will not be useful in\nall uses that can be devised.”\n\n“Why, then, you must ride two hundred miles for me,” said the patron.\n\n“A thousand, and call them a flea's leap,” answered the dependant; “I'll\ncause saddle my horse directly.”\n\n“Better stay till you know where you are to go, and what you are to\ndo,” quoth Bucklaw. “You know I have a kinswoman in Northumberland, Lady\nBlenkensop by name, whose old acquaintance I had the misfortune to lose\nin the period of my poverty, but the light of whose countenance shone\nforth upon me when the sun of my prosperity began to arise.”\n\n“D--n all such double-faced jades!” exclaimed Craigengelt, heroically;\n“this I will say for John Craigengelt, that he is his friend's friend\nthrough good report and bad report, poverty and riches; and you know\nsomething of that yourself, Bucklaw.”\n\n“I have not forgot your merits,” said his patron; “I do remember that,\nin my extremities, you had a mind to CRIMP me for the service of the\nFrench king, or of the Pretender; and, moreover, that you afterwards\nlent me a score of pieces, when, as I firmly believe, you had heard the\nnews that old Lady Girnington had a touch of the dead palsy. But don't\nbe downcast, John; I believe, after all, you like me very well in your\nway, and it is my misfortune to have no better counsellor at present.\nTo return to this Lady Blenkensop, you must know, she is a close\nconfederate of Duchess Sarah.”\n\n“What! of Sall Jennings?” exclaimed Craigengelt; “then she must be a\ngood one.”\n\n“Hold your tongue, and keep your Tory rants to yourself, if it be\npossible,” said Bucklaw. “I tell you, that through the Duchess of\nMarlborough has this Northumbrian cousin of mine become a crony of Lady\nAshton, the Keeper's wife, or, I may say, the Lord Keeper's Lady Keeper,\nand she has favoured Lady Blenkensop with a visit on her return from\nLondon, and is just now at her old mansion-house on the banks of the\nWansbeck. Now, sir, as it has been the use and wont of these ladies to\nconsider their husbands as of no importance in the management of their\nown families, it has been their present pleasure, without consulting\nSir William Ashton, to put on the tapis a matrimonial alliance, to be\nconcluded between Lucy Ashton and my own right honourable self, Lady\nAshton acting as self-constituted plenipotentiary on the part of her\ndaughter and husband, and Mother Blenkensop, equally unaccredited, doing\nme the honour to be my representative. You may suppose I was a little\nastonished when I found that a treaty, in which I was so considerably\ninterested, had advanced a good way before I was even consulted.”\n\n“Capot me! if I think that was according to the rules of the game,” said\nhis confidant; “and pray, what answer did you return?”\n\n“Why, my first thought was to send the treaty to the devil, and the\nnegotiators along with it, for a couple of meddling old women; my next\nwas to laugh very hearily; and my third and last was a settled opinion\nthat the thing was reasonable, and would suit me well enough.”\n\n“Why, I thought you had never seen the wench but once, and then she had\nher riding-mask on; I am sure you told me so.”\n\n“Ay, but I liked her very well then. And Ravenswood's dirty usage of\nme--shutting me out of doors to dine with the lackeys, because he\nhad the Lord Keeper, forsooth, and his daughter, to be guests in his\nbeggarly castle of starvation,--d--n me, Craigengelt, if I ever forgive\nhim till I play him as good a trick!”\n\n“No more you should, if you are a lad of mettle,” said Craigengelt, the\nmatter now taking a turn in which he could sympathise; “and if you carry\nthis wench from him, it will break his heart.”\n\n“That it will not,” said Bucklaw; “his heart is all steeled over with\nreason and philosophy, things that you, Craigie, know nothing about\nmore than myself, God help me. But it will break his pride, though, and\nthat's what I'm driving at.”\n\n“Distance me!” said Craigengelt, “but I know the reason now of his\nunmannerly behaviour at his old tumble-down tower yonder. Ashamed of\nyour company?--no, no! Gad, he was afraid you would cut in and carry off\nthe girl.”\n\n“Eh! Craigengelt?” said Bucklaw, “do you really think so? but no, no!\nhe is a devilish deal prettier man than I am.” “Who--he?” exclaimed the\nparasite. “He's as black as the crook; and for his size--he's a tall\nfellow, to be sure, but give me a light, stout, middle-sized----”\n\n“Plague on thee!” said Bucklaw, interrupting him, “and on me for\nlistening to you! You would say as much if I were hunch-backed. But as\nto Ravenswood--he has kept no terms with me, I'll keep none with him; if\nI CAN win this girl from him, I WILL win her.”\n\n“Win her! 'sblood, you SHALL win her, point, quint, and quatorze, my\nking of trumps; you shall pique, repique, and capot him.”\n\n“Prithee, stop thy gambling cant for one instant,” said Bucklaw.\n“Things have come thus far, that I have entertained the proposal of my\nkinswoman, agreed to the terms of jointure, amount of fortune, and so\nforth, and that the affair is to go forward when Lady Ashton comes down,\nfor she takes her daughter and her son in her own hand. Now they want me\nto send up a confidential person with some writings.”\n\n“By this good win, I'll ride to the end of the world--the very gates of\nJericho, and the judgment-seat of Prester John, for thee!” ejaculated\nthe Captain.\n\n“Why, I believe you would do something for me, and a great deal for\nyourself. Now, any one could carry the writings; but you will have a\nlittle more to do. You must contrive to drop out before my Lady Ashton,\njust as if it were a matter of little consequence, the residence of\nRavenswood at her husband's house, and his close intercourse with Miss\nAshton; and you may tell her that all the country talks of a visit from\nthe Marquis of A----, as it is supposed, to make up the match betwixt\nRavenswood and her daughter. I should like to hear what she says to all\nthis; for, rat me! if I have any idea of starting for the plate at all\nif Ravenswood is to win the race, and he has odds against me already.”\n\n“Never a bit; the wench has too much sense, and in that belief I drink\nher health a third time; and, were time and place fitting, I would drink\nit on bended knees, and he that would not pledge me, I would make his\nguts garter his stockings.”\n\n“Hark ye, Craigengelt; as you are going into the society of women of\nrank,” said Bucklaw, “I'll thank you to forget your strange blackguard\noaths and 'damme's.' I'll write to them, though, that you are a blunt,\nuntaught fellow.”\n\n“Ay, ay,” replied Craigengelt--“a plain, blunt, honest, downright\nsoldier.”\n\n“Not too honest, not too much of the soldier neither; but such as thou\nart, it is my luck to need thee, for I must have spurs put to Lady\nAshton's motions.” “I'll dash them up to the rowel-heads,” said\nCraigengelt; “she shall come here at the gallop, like a cow chased by a\nwhole nest of hornets, and her tail over her rump like a corkscrew.”\n\n“And hear ye, Craigie,” said Bucklaw; “your boots and doublet are good\nenough to drink in, as the man says in the play, but they are somewhat\ntoo greasy for tea-table service; prithee, get thyself a little better\nrigged out, and here is to pay all charges.”\n\n“Nay, Bucklaw; on my soul, man, you use me ill. However,” added\nCraigengelt, pocketing the money, “if you will have me so far indebted\nto you, I must be conforming.”\n\n“Well, horse and away!” said the patron, “so soon as you have got your\nriding livery in trim. You may ride the black crop-ear; and, hark ye,\nI'll make you a present of him to boot.”\n\n“I drink to the good luck of my mission,” answered the ambassador, “in a\nhalf-pint bumper.”\n\n“I thank ye, Craigie, and pledge you; I see nothing against it but the\nfather or the girl taking a tantrum, and I am told the mother can wind\nthem both round her little finger. Take care not to affront her with any\nof your Jacobite jargon.”\n\n“Oh, ay, true--she is a Whig, and a friend of old Sall of Marlborough;\nthank my stars, I can hoist any colours at a pinch! I have fought as\nhard under John Churchill as ever I did under Dundee or the Duke of\nBerwick.”\n\n“I verily believe you, Craigie,” said the lord of the mansion; “but,\nCraigie, do you, pray, step down to the cellar, and fetch us up a bottle\nof the Burgundy, 1678; it is in the fourth bin from the right-hand turn.\nAnd I say, Craigie, you may fetch up half a dozen whilst you are about\nit. Egad, we'll make a night on't!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n     And soon they spied the merry-men green,\n     And eke the coach and four.\n\n     Duke upon Duke.\n\nCRAIGENGELT set forth on his mission so soon as his equipage was\ncomplete, prosecuted his journey with all diligence, and accomplished\nhis commission with all the dexterity for which bucklaw had given him\ncredit. As he arrived with credentials from Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw, he\nwas extremely welcome to both ladies; and those who are prejudiced\nin favour of a new acquaintance can, for a time at least, discover\nexcellencies in his very faults and perfections in his deficiencies.\nAlthough both ladies were accustomed to good society, yet, being\npre-determined to find out an agreeable and well-behaved gentleman\nin Mr. Hayston's friend, they succeeded wonderfully in imposing on\nthemselves. It is true that Craigengelt was now handsomely dressed, and\nthat was a point of no small consequence. But, independent of outward\nshow, his blackguard impudence of address was construed into honourable\nbluntness becoming his supposed military profession; his hectoring\npassed for courage, and his sauciness for wit. Lest, however, any one\nshould think this a violation of probability, we must add, in fairness\nto the two ladies, that their discernment was greatly blinded, and their\nfavour propitiated, by the opportune arrival of Captain Craigengelt in\nthe moment when they were longing for a third hand to make a party at\ntredrille, in which, as in all games, whether of chance or skill, that\nworthy person was a great proficient.\n\nWhen he found himself established in favour, his next point was how\nbest to use it for the furtherance of his patron's views. He found\nLady Ashton prepossessed strongly in favour of the motion which Lady\nBlenkensop, partly from regard to her kinswoman, partly from the spirit\nof match-making, had not hesitated to propose to her; so that his task\nwas an easy one. Bucklaw, reformed from his prodigality, was just\nthe sort of husband which she desired to have for her Shepherdess of\nLammermoor; and while the marriage gave her an easy fortune, and a\nrespectable country gentleman for her husband, Lady Ashton was\nof opinion that her destinies would be fully and most favourably\naccomplished. It so chanced, also, that Bucklaw, among his new\nacquisitions, had gained the management of a little political interest\nin a neighbouring county where the Douglas family originally held large\npossessions. It was one of the bosom-hopes of Lady Ashton that her\neldest son, Sholto, should represent this county in the British\nParliament, and she saw this alliance with Bucklaw as a circumstance\nwhich might be highly favourable to her wishes.\n\nCraigengelt, who, in his way, by no means wanted sagacity, no sooner\ndiscovered in what quarter the wind of Lady Ashton's wishes sate, than\nhe trimmed his course accordingly. “There was little to prevent Bucklaw\nhimself from sitting for the county; he must carry the heat--must walk\nthe course. Two cousins-german, six more distant kinsmen, his factor and\nhis chamberlain, were all hollow votes; and the Girnington interest had\nalways carried, betwixt love and fear, about as many more. But Bucklaw\ncared no more about riding the first horse, and that sort of thing, than\nhe, Craigengelt, did about a game at birkie: it was a pity his interest\nwas not in good guidance.”\n\nAll this Lady Ashton drank in with willing and attentive ears, resolving\ninternally to be herself the person who should take the management of\nthe political influence of her destined son-in-law, for the benefit of\nher eldest-born, Sholto, and all other parties concerned.\n\nWhen he found her ladyship thus favourably disposed, the Captain\nproceeded, to use his employer's phrase, to set spurs to her resolution,\nby hinting at the situation of matters at Ravenswood Castle, the long\nresidence which the heir of that family had made with the Lord Keeper,\nand the reports which--though he would be d--d ere he gave credit to any\nof them--had been idly circulated in the neighbourhood. It was not the\nCaptain's cue to appear himself to be uneasy on the subject of these\nrumours; but he easily saw from Lady Ashton's flushed cheek, hesitating\nvoice, and flashing eye, that she had caught the alarm which he intended\nto communicate. She had not heard from her husband so often or so\nregularly as she though him bound in duty to have written, and of this\nvery interesting intelligence concerning his visit to the Tower of\nWolf's Crag, and the guest whom, with such cordiality, he had received\nat Ravenswood Castle, he had suffered his lady to remain altogether\nignorant, until she now learned it by the chance information of a\nstranger. Such concealment approached, in her apprehension, to a\nmisprision, at last, of treason, if not to actual rebellion against\nher matrimonial authority; and in her inward soul she did vow to take\nvengeance on the Lord Keeper, as on a subject detected in meditating\nrevolt. Her indignation burned the more fiercely as she found herself\nobliged to suppress it in presence of Lady Blenkensop, the kinswoman,\nand of Craigengelt, the confidential friend, of Bucklaw, of whose\nalliance she now became trebly desirous, since it occurred to her\nalarmed imagination that her husband might, in his policy or timidity,\nprefer that of Ravenswood.\n\nThe Captain was engineer enough to discover that the train was fired;\nand therefore heard, in the course of the same day, without the least\nsurprise, that Lady Ashton had resolved to abridge her visit to Lady\nBlenkensop, and set forth with the peep of morning on her return to\nScotland, using all the despatch which the state of the roads and the\nmode of travelling would possibly permit.\n\nUnhappy Lord Keeper! little was he aware what a storm was travelling\ntowards him in all the speed with which an old-fashioned coach and six\ncould possibly achieve its journey. He, like Don Gayferos, “forgot his\nlady fair and true,” and was only anxious about the expected visit\nof the Marquis of A----. Soothfast tidings had assured him that this\nnobleman was at length, and without fail, to honour his castle at one\nin the afternoon, being a late dinner-hour; and much was the bustle in\nconsequence of the annunciation. The Lord Keeper traversed the chambers,\nheld consultation with the butler in the cellars, and even ventured, at\nthe risk of a demele with a cook of a spirit lofty enough to scorn the\nadmonitions of Lady Ashton herself, to peep into the kitchen. Satisfied,\nat length, that everything was in as active a train of preparation as\nwas possible, he summoned Ravenswood and his daughter to walk upon the\nterrace, for the purpose of watching, from that commanding position,\nthe earliest symptoms of his lordship's approach. For this purpose, with\nslow and idle step, he paraded the terrace, which, flanked with a heavy\nstone battlement, stretched in front of the castle upon a level with the\nfirst story; while visitors found access to the court by a projecting\ngateway, the bartizan or flat-leaded roof of which was accessible from\nthe terrace by an easy flight of low and broad steps. The whole bore a\nresemblance partly to a castle, partly to a nobleman's seat; and though\ncalculated, in some respects, for defence, evinced that it had been\nconstructed under a sense of the power and security of the ancient Lords\nof Ravenswood.\n\nThis pleasant walk commanded a beautiful and extensive view. But what\nwas most to our present purpose, there were seen from the terrace two\nroads, one leading from the east, and one from the westward, which,\ncrossing a ridge opposed to the eminence on which the castle stood, at\ndifferent angles, gradually approached each other, until they joined not\nfar from the gate of the avenue. It was to the westward approach that\nthe Lord Keeper, from a sort of fidgeting anxiety, his daughter, from\ncomplaisance to him, and Ravenswood, though feeling some symptoms of\ninternal impatience, out of complaisance to his daughter, directed their\neyes to see the precursors of the Marquis's approach.\n\nThese were not long of presenting themselves. Two running footmen,\ndressed in white, with black jockey-caps, and long staffs in their\nhands, headed the train; and such was their agility, that they found\nno difficulty in keeping the necessary advance, which the etiquette of\ntheir station required, before the carriage and horsemen. Onward\nthey came at a long swinging trot, arguing unwearied speed in their\nlong-breathed calling. Such running footmen are often alluded to in old\nplays (I would particularly instance Middleton's Mad World, my Masters),\nand perhaps may be still remembered by some old persons in Scotland,\nas part of the retinue of the ancient nobility when travelling in full\nceremony. Behind these glancing meteors, who footed it as if the Avenger\nof Blood had been behind them, came a cloud of dust, raised by riders\nwho preceded, attended, or followed the state-carriage of the Marquis.\n\nThe privilege of nobility, in those days, had something in it impressive\non the imagination. The dresses and liveries and number of their\nattendants, their style of travelling, the imposing, and almost warlike,\nair of the armed men who surrounded them, place them far above the\nlaird, who travelled with his brace of footmen; and as to rivalry from\nthe mercantile part of the community, these would as soon have thought\nof imitating the state equipage of the Sovereign. At present it\nis different; and I myself, Peter Pattieson, in a late journey to\nEdinburgh, had the honour, in the mail-coach phrase to “change a leg”\n with a peer of the realm. It was not so in the days of which I write;\nand the Marquis's approach, so long expected in vain, now took place\nin the full pomp of ancient aristocracy. Sir William Ashton was so\nmuch interested in what he beheld, and in considering the ceremonial\nof reception, in case any circumstance had been omitted, that he scarce\nheard his son Henry exclaim: “There is another coach and six coming down\nthe east road, papa; can they both belong to the Marquis of A----?”\n\nAt length, when the youngster had fairly compelled his attention by\npulling his sleeve,\n\n     He turned his eyes, and, as he turned, survey'd\n     An awful vision.\n\nSure enough, another coach and six, with four servants or outriders in\nattendance, was descending the hill from the eastward, at such a pace as\nmade it doubtful which of the carriages thus approaching from different\nquarters would first reach the gate at the extremity of the avenue. The\none coach was green, the other blue; and not the green and blue chariots\nin the circus of Rome or Constantinople excited more turmoil among the\ncitizens than the double apparition occasioned in the mind of the Lord\nKeeper.\n\nWe all remember the terrible exclamation of the dying profligate, when a\nfriend, to destroy what he supposed the hypochondriac idea of a spectre\nappearing in a certain shape at a given hour, placed before him a person\ndressed up in the manner he described. “Mon Dieu!” said the expiring\nsinner, who, it seems, saw both the real and polygraphic apparition,\n“il y en a deux!” The surprise of the Lord Keeper was scarcely less\nunpleasing at the duplication of the expected arrival; his mind misgave\nhim strangely. There was no neighbour who would have approached so\nunceremoniously, at a time when ceremony was held in such respect. It\nmust be Lady Ashton, said his conscience, and followed up the hint with\nan anxious anticipation of the purpose of her sudden and unannounced\nreturn. He felt that he was caught “in the manner.” That the company\nin which she had so unluckily surprised him was likely to be highly\ndistasteful to her, there was no question; and the only hope which\nremained for him was her high sense of dignified propriety, which, he\ntrusted, might prevent a public explosion. But so active were his doubts\nand fears as altogether to derange his purposed ceremonial for the\nreception of the Marquis.\n\nThese feelings of apprehension were not confined to Sir William Ashton.\n“It is my mother--it is my mother!” said Lucy, turning as pale as ashes,\nand clasping her hands together as she looked at Ravenswood.\n\n“And if it be Lady Ashton,” said her lover to her in a low tone, “what\ncan be the occasion of such alarm? Surely the return of a lady to\nthe family from which she has been so long absent should excite other\nsensations than those of fear and dismay.”\n\n“You do not know my mother,” said Miss Ashton, in a tone almost\nbreathless with terror; “what will she say when she sees you in this\nplace!”\n\n“My stay has been too long,” said Ravenswood, somewhat haughtily, “if\nher displeasure at my presence is likely to be so formidable. My dear\nLucy,” he resumed, in a tone of soothing encouragement, “you are too\nchildishly afraid of Lady Ashton; she is a woman of family--a lady\nof fashion--a person who must know the world, and what is due to her\nhusband and her husband's guests.” Lucy shook her head; and, as if\nher mother, still at the distance of half a mile, could have seen and\nscrutinised her deportment, she withdrew herself from beside Ravenswood,\nand, taking her brother Henry's arm, led him to a different part of the\nterrace. The Keeper also shuffled down towards the portal of the great\ngate, without inviting Ravenswood to accompany him; and thus he remained\nstanding alone on the terrace, deserted and shunned, as it were, by\nthe inhabitants of the mansion. This suited not the mood of one who was\nproud in proportion to his poverty, and who thought that, in sacrificing\nhis deep-rooted resentments so far as to become Sir William Ashton's\nguest, he conferred a favour, and received none. “I can forgive Lucy,”\n he said to himself; “she is young, timid, and conscious of an important\nengagement assumed without her mother's sanction; yet she should\nremember with whom it has been assumed, and leave me no reason to\nsuspect that she is ashamed of her choice. For the Keeper, sense,\nspirit, and expression seem to have left his face and manner since he\nhad the first glimpse of Lady Ashton's carriage. I must watch how this\nis to end; and, if they give me reason to think myself an unwelcome\nguest, my visit is soon abridged.”\n\nWith these suspicions floating on his mind, he left the terrace, and\nwalking towards the stables of the castle, gave directions that his\nhorse should be kept in readiness, in case he should have occasion to\nride abroad.\n\nIn the mean while, the drivers of the two carriages, the approach of\nwhich had occasioned so much dismay at the castle, had become aware of\neach other's presence, as they approached upon different lines to\nthe head of the avenue, as a common centre. Lady Ashton's driver and\npostilions instantly received orders to get foremost, if possible, her\nladyship being desirous of despatching her first interview with her\nhusband before the arrival of these guests, whoever they might happen to\nbe. On the other hand, the coachman of the Marquis, conscious of his own\ndignity and that of his master, and observing the rival charioteer was\nmending his pace, resolved, like a true brother of the whip, whether\nancient or modern, to vindicate his right of precedence. So that, to\nincrease the confusion of the Lord Keeper's understanding, he saw the\nshort time which remained for consideration abridged by the haste of the\ncontending coachmen, who, fixing their eyes sternly on each other, and\napplying the lash smartly to their horses, began to thunder down the\ndescent with emulous rapidity, while the horsemen who attended them were\nforced to put on to a hand-gallop.\n\nSir William's only chance now remaining was the possibility of an\noverturn, and that his lady or visitor might break their necks. I am\nnot aware that he formed any distinct wish on the subject, but I have no\nreason to think that his grief in either case would have been altogether\ninconsolable. This chance, however, also disappeared; for Lady Ashton,\nthough insensible to fear, began to see the ridicule of running a race\nwith a visitor of distinction, the goal being the portal of her own\ncastle, and commanded her coachman, as they approached the avenue, to\nslacken his pace, and allow precedence to the stranger's equipage; a\ncommand which he gladly obeyed, as coming in time to save his honour,\nthe horses of the Marquis's carriage being better, or, at least, fresher\nthan his own. He restrained his pace, therefore, and suffered the green\ncoach to enter the avenue, with all its retinue, which pass it occupied\nwith the speed of a whirlwind. The Marquis's laced charioteer no\nsooner found the pas d'avance was granted to him than he resumed a more\ndeliberate pace, at which he advanced under the embowering shade of the\nlofty elms, surrounded by all the attendants; while the carriage of Lady\nAshton followed, still more slowly, at some distance.\n\nIn the front of the castle, and beneath the portal which admitted guests\ninto the inner court, stood Sir William Ashton, much perplexed in mind,\nhis younger son and daughter beside him, and in their rear a train of\nattendants of various ranks, in and out of livery. The nobility and\ngentry of Scotland, at this period, were remarkable even to extravagance\nfor the number of their servants, whose services were easily purchased\nin a country where men were numerous beyond proportion to the means of\nemploying them.\n\nThe manners of a man trained like Sir William Ashton are too much at his\ncommand to remain long disconcerted with the most adverse concurrence\nof circumstances. He received the Marquis, as he alighted from his\nequipage, with the usual compliments of welcome; and, as he ushered\nhim into the great hall, expressed his hope that his journey had been\npleasant. The Marquis was a tall, well-made man, with a thoughtful and\nintelligent countenance, and an eye in which the fire of ambition had\nfor some years replaced the vivacity of youth; a bold, proud expression\nof countenance, yet chastened by habitual caution, and the desire\nwhich, as the head of a party, he necessarily entertained of acquiring\npopularity. He answered with courtesy the courteous inquiries of the\nLord Keeper, and was formally presented to Miss Ashton, in the course\nof which ceremony the Lord Keeper gave the first symptom of what was\nchiefly occupying his mind, by introducing his daughter as “his wife,\nLady Ashton.”\n\nLucy blushed; the Marquis looked surprised at the extremely juvenile\nappearance of his hostess, and the Lord Keeper with difficulty rallied\nhimself so far as to explain. “I should have said my daughter, my lord;\nbut the truth is, that I saw Lady Ashton's carriage enter the avenue\nshortly after your lordship's, and----”\n\n“Make no apology, my lord,” replied his noble guest; “let me entreat\nyou will wait on your lady, and leave me to cultivate Miss Ashton's\nacquaintance. I am shocked my people should have taken precedence of our\nhostess at her own gate; but your lordship is aware that I supposed\nLady Ashton was still in the south. Permit me to beseech you will waive\nceremony, and hasten to welcome her.”\n\nThis was precisely what the Lord Keeper longed to do; and he instantly\nprofited by his lordship's obliging permission. To see Lady Ashton, and\nencounter the first burst of her displeasure in private, might prepare\nher, in some degree, to receive her unwelcome guests with due decorum.\nAs her carriage, therefore, stopped, the arm of the attentive husband\nwas ready to assist Lady Ashton in dismounting. Looking as if she\nsaw him not, she put his arm aside, and requested that of Captain\nCraigengelt, who stood by the coach with his laced hat under his arm,\nhaving acted as cavaliere servente, or squire in attendance, during the\njourney. Taking hold of this respectable person's arm as if to support\nher, Lady Ashton traversed the court, uttering a word or two by way\nof direction to the servants, but not one to Sir William, who in\nvain endeavoured to attract her attention, as he rather followed than\naccompanied her into the hall, in which they found the Marquis in close\nconversation with the Master of Ravenswood. Lucy had taken the first\nopportunity of escaping. There was embarrassment on every countenance\nexcept that of the Marquis of A----; for even Craigengelt's impudence\nwas hardly able to veil his fear of Ravenswood, an the rest felt the\nawkwardness of the position in which they were thus unexpectedly placed.\n\nAfter waiting a moment to be presented by Sir William Ashton, the\nMarquis resolved to introduce himself. “The Lord Keeper,” he said,\nbowing to Lady Ashton, “has just introduced to me his daughter as his\nwife; he might very easily present Lady Ashton as his daughter, so\nlittle does she differ from what I remember her some years since. Will\nshe permit an old acquaintance the privilege of a guest?”\n\nHe saluted the lady with too good a grace to apprehend a repulse,\nand then proceeded: “This, Lady Ashton, is a peacemaking visit,\nand therefore I presume to introduce my cousin, the young Master of\nRavenswood, to your favourable notice.”\n\nLady Ashton could not choose but courtesy; but there was in her\nobeisance an air of haughtiness approaching to contemptuous repulse.\nRavenswood could not choose but bow; but his manner returned the scorn\nwith which he had been greeted.\n\n“Allow me,” she said, “to present to your lordship MY friend.”\n Craigengelt, with the forward impudence which men of his cast mistake\nfor ease, made a sliding bow to the Marquis, which he graced by a\nflourish of his gold-laced hat. The lady turned to her husband. “You\nand I, Sir William,” she said, and these were the first words she had\naddressed to him, “have acquired new acquaintances since we parted; let\nme introduce the acquisition I have made to mine--Captain Craigengelt.”\n\nAnother bow, and another flourish of the gold-laced hat, which was\nreturned by the Lord Keeper without intimation of former recognition,\nand with that sort of anxious readiness which intimated his wish that\npeace and amnesty should take place betwixt the contending parties,\nincluding the auxiliaries on both sides. “Let me introduce you to the\nMaster of Ravenswood,” said he to Captain Craigengelt, following up the\nsame amicable system.\n\nBut the Master drew up his tall form to the full extent of his height,\nand without so much as looking towards the person thus introduced to\nhim, he said, in a marked tone: “Captain Craigengelt and I are already\nperfectly well acquainted with each other.”\n\n“Perfectly--perfectly,” replied the Captain, in a mumbling tone, like\nthat of a double echo, and with a flourish of his hat, the circumference\nof which was greatly abridged, compared with those which had so\ncordially graced his introduction to the Marquis and the Lord Keeper.\n\nLockhard, followed by three menials, now entered with wine and\nrefreshments, which it was the fashion to offer as a whet before dinner;\nand when they were placed before the guests, Lady Ashton made an apology\nfor withdrawing her husband from them for some minutes upon business of\nspecial import. The Marquis, of course, requested her ladyship would lay\nherself under no restraint; and Craigengelt, bolting with speed a second\nglass of racy canary, hastened to leave the room, feeling no great\npleasure in the prospect of being left alone with the Marquis of A----\nand the Master of Ravenswood; the presence of the former holding him in\nawe, and that of the latter in bodily terror.\n\nSome arrangements about his horse and baggage formed the pretext for\nhis sudden retreat, in which he persevered, although Lady Ashton gave\nLockhard orders to be careful most particularly to accommodate Captain\nCraigengelt with all the attendance which he could possibly require. The\nMarquis and the Master of Ravenswood were thus left to communicate to\neach other their remarks upon the reception which they had met with,\nwhile Lady Ashton led the way, and her lord followed somewhat like a\ncondemned criminal, to her ladyship's dressing-room.\n\nSo soon as the spouses had both entered, her ladyship gave way to that\nfierce audacity of temper which she had with difficulty suppressed, out\nof respect to appearances. She shut the door behind the alarmed Lord\nKeeper, took the key out of the spring-lock, and with a countenance\nwhich years had not bereft of its haughty charms, and eyes which spoke\nat once resolution and resentment, she addressed her astounded husband\nin these words: “My lord, I am not greatly surprised at the connexions\nyou have been pleased to form during my absence, they are entirely in\nconformity with your birth and breeding; and if I did expect anything\nelse, I heartily own my error, and that I merit, by having done so, the\ndisappointment you had prepared for me.”\n\n“My dear Lady Ashton--my dear Eleanor [Margaret],” said the Lord Keeper,\n“listen to reason for a moment, and I will convince you I have acted\nwith all the regard due to the dignity, as well as the interest, of my\nfamily.”\n\n“To the interest of YOUR family I conceive you perfectly capable of\nattending,” returned the indignant lady, “and even to the dignity of\nyour own family also, as far as it requires any looking after. But as\nmine happens to be inextricably involved with it, you will excuse me if\nI choose to give my own attention so far as that is concerned.”\n\n“What would you have, Lady Ashton?” said the husband. “What is it that\ndispleases you? Why is it that, on your return after so long an absence,\nI am arraigned in this manner?” “Ask your own conscience, Sir William,\nwhat has prompted you to become a renegade to your political party and\nopinions, and led you, for what I know, to be on the point of marrying\nyour only daughter to a beggarly Jacobite bankrupt, the inveterate enemy\nof your family to the boot.”\n\n“Why, what, in the name of common sense and common civility, would you\nhave me do, madam?” answered her husband. “Is it possible for me, with\nordinary decency, to turn a young gentleman out of my house, who saved\nmy daughter's life and my own, but the other morning, as it were?”\n\n“Saved your life! I have heard of that story,” said the lady. “The Lord\nKeeper was scared by a dun cow, and he takes the young fellow who killed\nher for Guy of Warwick: any butcher from Haddington may soon have an\nequal claim on your hospitality.”\n\n“Lady Ashton,” stammered the Keeper, “this is intolerable; and when I am\ndesirous, too, to make you easy by any sacrifice, if you would but tell\nme what you would be at.”\n\n“Go down to your guests,” said the imperious dame, “and make your\napology to Ravenswood, that the arrival of Captain Craigengelt and some\nother friends renders it impossible for you to offer him lodgings at the\ncastle. I expect young Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw.”\n\n“Good heavens, madam!” ejaculated her husband. “Ravenswood to give place\nto Craigengelt, a common gambler and an informer! It was all I could do\nto forbear desiring the fellow to get out of my house, and I was much\nsurprised to see him in your ladyship's train.”\n\n“Since you saw him there, you might be well assured,” answered this meek\nhelpmate, “that he was proper society. As to this Ravenswood, he only\nmeets with the treatment which, to my certain knowledge, he gave to a\nmuch-valued friend of mine, who had the misfortune to be his guest some\ntime since. But take your resolution; for, if Ravenswood does not quit\nthe house, I will.”\n\nSir William Ashton paced up and down the apartment in the most\ndistressing agitation; fear, and shame, and anger contending against the\nhabitual deference he was in the use of rendering to his lady. At length\nit ended, as is usual with timid minds placed in such circumstances, in\nhis adopting a mezzo termine--a middle measure.\n\n“I tell you frankly, madam, I neither can nor will be guilty of the\nincivility you propose to the Master of Ravenswood; he has not deserved\nit at my hand. If you will be so unreasonable as to insult a man of\nquality under your own roof, I cannot prevent you; but I will not at\nleast be the agent in such a preposterous proceeding.”\n\n“You will not?” asked the lady.\n\n“No, by heavens, madam!” her husband replied; “ask me anything congruent\nwith common decency, as to drop his acquaintance by degrees, or the\nlike; but to bid him leave my house is what I will nto and cannot\nconsent to.”\n\n“Then the task of supporting the honour of the family will fall on me,\nas it has often done before,” said the lady.\n\nShe sat down, and hastily wrote a few lines. The Lord Keeper made\nanother effort to prevent her taking a step so decisive, just as she\nopened the door to call her female attendant from the ante-room. “Think\nwhat you are doing, Lady Ashton: you are making a mortal enemy of a\nyoung man who is like to have the means of harming us----”\n\n“Did you ever know a Douglas who feared an enemy?” answered the lady,\ncontemptuously.\n\n“Ay, but he is as proud and vindictive as an hundred Douglasses, and an\nhundred devils to boot. Think of it for a night only.”\n\n“Not for another moment,” answered the lady. “Here, Mrs. Patullo, give\nthis billet to young Ravenswood.”\n\n“To the Master, madam!” said Mrs. Patullo.\n\n“Ay, to the Master, if you call him so.”\n\n“I wash my hands of it entirely,” said the Keeper; “and I shall go down\ninto the garden, and see that Jardine gathers the winter fruit for the\ndessert.”\n\n“Do so,” said the lady, looking after him with glances of infinite\ncontempt; “and thank God that you leave one behind you as fit to protect\nthe honour of the family as you are to look after pippins and pears.”\n\nThe Lord Keeper remained long enough in the garden to give her\nladyship's mind time to explode, and to let, as he thought, at least the\nfirst violence of Ravenswood's displeasure blow over. When he entered\nthe hall, he found the Marquis of A---- giving orders to some of his\nattendants. He seemed in high displeasure, and interrupted an apology\nwhich Sir William had commenced for having left his lordship alone.\n\n“I presume, Sir William, you are no stranger to this singular billet\nwith which MY kinsman of Ravenswood (an emphasis on the word 'my') has\nbeen favoured by your lady; and, of course, that you are prepared\nto receive my adieus. My kinsman is already gone, having thought it\nunnecessary to offer any on his part, since all former civilities had\nbeen cancelled by this singular insult.”\n\n“I protest, my lord,” said Sir William, holding the billet in his hand,\n“I am not privy to the contents of this letter. I know Lady Ashton is\na warm-tempered and prejudiced woman, and I am sincerely sorry for any\noffence that has been given or taken; but I hope your lordship will\nconsider that a lady----”\n\n“Should bear herself towards persons of a certain rank with the breeding\nof one,” said the Marquis, completing the half-uttered sentence.\n\n“True, my lord,” said the unfortunate Keeper; “but Lady Ashton is still\na woman----”\n\n“And, as such, methinks,” said the Marquis, again interrupting him,\n“should be taught the duties which correspond to her station. But\nhere she comes, and I will learn from her own mouth the reason of this\nextraordinary and unexpected affront offered to my near relation, while\nboth he and I were her ladyship's guests.”\n\nLady Ashton accordingly entered the apartment at this moment. Her\ndispute with Sir William, and a subsequent interview with her daughter,\nhad not prevented her from attending to the duties of her toilette. She\nappeared in full dress; and, from the character of her countenance and\nmanner, well became the splendour with which ladies of quality then\nappeared on such occasions.\n\nThe Marquis of A---- bowed haughtily, and she returned the salute with\nequal pride and distance of demeanour. He then took from the passive\nhand of Sir William Ashton the billet he had given him the moment before\nhe approached the lady, and was about to speak, when she interrupted\nhim. “I perceive, my lord, you are about to enter upon an unpleasant\nsubject. I am sorry any such should have occurred at this time, to\ninterrupt in the slightest degree the respectful reception due to your\nlordship; but so it is. Mr. Edgar Ravenswood, for whom I have addressed\nthe billet in your lordship's hand, has abused the hospitality of this\nfamily, and Sir William Ashton's softness of temper, in order to seduce\na young person into engagements without her parents' consent, and of\nwhich they never can approve.”\n\nBoth gentlemen answered at once. “My kinsman is incapable----” said the\nLord Marquis.\n\n“I am confident that my daughter Lucy is still more incapable----” said\nthe Lord Keeper.\n\nLady Ashton at once interrupted and replied to them both: “My Lord\nMarquis, your kinsman, if Mr. Ravenswood has the honour to be so, has\nmade the attempt privately to secure the affections of this young and\ninexperienced girl. Sir William Ashton, your daughter has been simple\nenough to give more encouragement than she ought to have done to so very\nimproper a suitor.”\n\n“And I think, madam,” said the Lord Keeper, losing his accustomed temper\nand patience, “that if you had nothing better to tell us, you had better\nhave kept this family secret to yourself also.”\n\n“You will pardon me, Sir William,” said the lady, calmly; “the noble\nMarquis has a right to know the cause of the treatment I have found it\nnecessary to use to a gentleman whom he calls his blood-relation.”\n\n“It is a cause,” muttered the Lord Keeper, “which has emerged since the\neffect has taken place; for, if it exists at all, I am sure she knew\nnothing of it when her letter to Ravenswood was written.”\n\n“It is the first time that I have heard of this,” said the Marquis;\n“but, since your ladyship has tabled a subject so delicate, permit me\nto say, that my kinsman's birth and connexions entitled him to a patient\nhearing, and at least a civil refusal, even in case of his being so\nambitious as to raise his eyes to the daughter of Sir William Ashton.”\n\n“You will recollect, my lord, of what blood Miss Lucy Ashton is come by\nthe mother's side,” said the lady.\n\n“I do remember your descent--from a younger branch of the house of\nAngus,” said the Marquis; “and your ladyship--forgive me, lady--ought\nnot to forget that the Ravenswoods have thrice intermarried with the\nmain stem. Come, madam, I know how matters stand--old and long-fostered\nprejudices are difficult to get over, I make every allowance for them; I\nought not, and I would not, otherwise have suffered my kinsman to depart\nalone, expelled, in a manner, from this house, but I had hopes of being\na mediator. I am still unwilling to leave you in anger, and shall not\nset forward till after noon, as I rejoin the Master of Ravenswood upon\nthe road a few miles from hence. Let us talk over this matter more\ncoolly.”\n\n“It is what I anxiously desire, my lord,” said Sir William Ashton,\neagerly. “Lady Ashton, we will not permit my Lord of A---- to leave us\nin displeasure. We must compel him to tarry dinner at the castle.”\n\n“The castle,” said the lady, “and all that it contains, are at the\ncommand of the Marquis, so long as he chooses to honour it with his\nresidence; but touching the farther discussion of this disagreeable\ntopic----”\n\n“Pardon me, good madam,” said the Marquis; “but I cannot allow you to\nexpress any hasty resolution on a subject so important. I see that more\ncompany is arriving; and, since I have the good fortune to renew my\nformer acquaintance with Lady Ashton, I hope she will give me leave to\navoid perilling what I prize so highly upon any disagreeable subject of\ndiscussion--at least till we have talked over more pleasant topics.”\n\nThe lady smiled, courtesied, and gave her hand to the Marquis, by whom,\nwith all the formal gallantry of the time, which did not permit the\nguest to tuck the lady of the house under the arm, as a rustic does his\nsweetheart at a wake, she was ushered to the eating-room.\n\nHere they were joined by Bucklaw, Craigengelt, and other neighbours,\nwhom the Lord Keeper had previously invited to meet the Marquis of\nA----. An apology, founded upon a slight indisposition, was alleged\nas an excuse for the absence of Miss Ashton, whose seat appeared\nunoccupied. The entertainment was splendid to profusion, and was\nprotracted till a late hour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n     Such was our fallen father's fate,\n     Yet better than mine own;\n     He shared his exile with his mate,\n     I'm banish'd forth alone.\n\n     WALLER\n\nI WILL not attempt to describe the mixture of indignation and regret\nwith which Ravenswood left the seat which had belonged to his ancestors.\nThe terms in which Lady Ashton's billet was couched rendered it\nimpossible for him, without being deficient in that spirit of which he\nperhaps had too much, to remain an instant longer within its walls.\nThe Marquis, who had his share in the affront, was, nevertheless, still\nwilling to make some efforts at conciliation. He therefore suffered his\nkinsman to depart alone, making him promise, however, that he would wait\nfor him at the small inn called the Tod's Hole, situated, as our readers\nmay be pleased to recollect, half-way betwixt Ravenswood Castle and\nWolf's Crag, and about five Scottish miles distant from each. Here the\nMarquis proposed to join the Master of Ravenswood, either that night or\nthe next morning. His own feelings would have induced him to have left\nthe castle directly, but he was loth to forfeit, without at least one\neffort, the advantages which he had proposed from his visit to the Lord\nKeeper; and the Master of Ravenswood was, even in the very heat of his\nresentment, unwilling to foreclose any chance of reconciliation which\nmight arise out of the partiality which Sir William Ashton had shown\ntowards him, as well as the intercessory arguments of his noble kinsman.\nHe himself departed without a moment's delay, farther than was necessary\nto make this arrangement.\n\nAt first he spurred his horse at a quick pace through an avenue of the\npark, as if, by rapidity of motion, he could stupify the confusion of\nfeelings with which he was assailed. But as the road grew wilder and\nmore sequestered, and when the trees had hidden the turrets of the\ncastle, he gradually slackened his pace, as if to indulge the painful\nreflections which he had in vain endeavoured to repress. The path in\nwhich he found himself led him to the Mermaiden's Fountain, and to the\ncottage of Alice; and the fatal influence which superstitious belief\nattached to the former spot, as well as the admonitions which had\nbeen in vain offered to him by the inhabitant of the latter, forced\nthemselves upon his memory. “Old saws speak truth,” he said to himself,\n“and the Mermaiden's Well has indeed witnessed the last act of rashness\nof the heir of Ravenswood. Alice spoke well,” he continued, “and I am\nin the situation which she foretold; or rather, I am more deeply\ndishonoured--not the dependant and ally of the destroyer of my father's\nhouse, as the old sibyl presaged, but the degraded wretch who has\naspired to hold that subordinate character, and has been rejected with\ndisdain.”\n\nWe are bound to tell the tale as we have received it; and, considering\nthe distance of the time, and propensity of those through whose mouths\nit has passed to the marvellous, this could not be called a Scottish\nstory unless it manifested a tinge of Scottish superstition. As\nRavenswood approached the solitary fountain, he is said to have met with\nthe following singular adventure: His horse, which was moving slowly\nforward, suddenly interrupted its steady and composed pace, snorted,\nreared, and, though urged by the spur, refused to proceed, as if some\nobject of terror had suddenly presented itself. On looking to the\nfountain, Ravenswood discerned a female figure, dressed in a white, or\nrather greyish, mantle, placed on the very spot on which Lucy Ashton\nhad reclined while listening to the fatal tale of love. His immediate\nimpression was that she had conjectured by which path he would traverse\nthe park on his departure, and placed herself at this well-known and\nsequestered place of rendezvous, to indulge her own sorrow and his\nparting interview. In this belief he jumped from his horse, and,\nmaking its bridle fast to a tree, walked hastily towards the\nfountain, pronouncing eagerly, yet under his breath, the words, “Miss\nAshton!--Lucy!”\n\nThe figure turned as he addressed it, and displayed to his wondering\neyes the features, not of Lucy Ashton, but of old blind Alice. The\nsingularity of her dress, which rather resembled a shroud than the\ngarment of a living woman; the appearance of her person, larger, as\nit struck him, than it usually seemed to be; above all, the strange\ncircumstance of a blind, infirm, and decrepit person being found alone\nand at a distance from her habitation (considerable, if her infirmities\nbe taken into account), combined to impress him with a feeling of wonder\napproaching to fear. As he approached, she arose slowly from her seat,\nheld her shrivelled hand up as if to prevent his coming more near,\nand her withered lips moved fast, although no sound issued from them.\nRavenswood stopped; and as, after a moment's pause, he again advanced\ntowards her, Alice, or her apparition, moved or glided backwards towards\nthe thicket, still keeping her face turned towards him. The trees soon\nhid the form from his sight; and, yielding to the strong and terrific\nimpression that the being which he had seen was not of this world, the\nMaster of Ravenswood remained rooted to the ground whereon he had\nstood when he caught his last view of her. At length, summoning up his\ncourage, he advanced to the spot on which the figure had seemed to\nbe seated; but neither was there pressure of the grass nor any other\ncircumstance to induce him to believe that what he had seen was real and\nsubstantial.\n\nFull of those strange thoughts and confused apprehensions which awake\nin the bosom of one who conceives he has witnessed some preternatural\nappearance, the Master of Ravenswood walked back towards his horse,\nfrequently, however, looking behind him, not without apprehension, as if\nexpecting that the vision would reappear. But the apparition, whether\nit was real or whether it was the creation of a heated and agitated\nimagination, returned not again; and he found his horse sweating and\nterrified, as if experiencing that agony of fear with which the presence\nof a supernatural being is supposed to agitate the brute creation. The\nMaster mounted, and rode slowly forward, soothing his steed from time\nto time, while the animal seemed internally to shrink and shudder, as\nif expecting some new object of fear at the opening of every glade.\nThe rider, after a moment's consideration, resolved to investigate the\nmatter further. “Can my eyes have deceived me,” he said, “and deceived\nme for such a space of time? Or are this woman's infirmities but\nfeigned, in order to excite compassion? And even then, her motion\nresembled not that of a living and existing person. Must I adopt the\npopular creed, and think that the unhappy being has formed a league with\nthe powers of darkness? I am determined to be resolved; I will not brook\nimposition even from my own eyes.”\n\nIn this uncertainty he rode up to the little wicket of Alice's garden.\nHer seat beneath the birch-tree was vacant, though the day was pleasant\nand the sun was high. He approached the hut, and heard from within the\nsobs and wailing of a female. No answer was returned when he knocked,\nso that, after a moment's pause, he lifted the latch and entered. It\nwas indeed a house of solitude and sorrow. Stretched upon her miserable\npallet lay the corpse of the last retainer of the house of Ravenswood\nwho still abode on their paternal domains! Life had but shortly\ndeparted; and the little girl by whom she had been attended in her last\nmoments was wringing her hands and sobbing, betwixt childish fear and\nsorrow, over the body of her mistress.\n\nThe Master of Ravenswood had some difficulty to compose the terrors\nof the poor child, whom his unexpected appearance had at first rather\nappalled than comforted; and when he succeeded, the first expression\nwhich the girl used intimated that “he had come too late.” Upon\ninquiring the meaning of this expression, he learned that the deceased,\nupon the first attack of the mortal agony, had sent a peasant to the\ncastle to beseech an interview of the Master of Ravenswood, and had\nexpressed the utmost impatience for his return. But the messengers of\nthe poor are tardy and negligent: the fellow had not reached the castle,\nas was afterwards learned, until Ravenswood had left it, and had then\nfound too much amusement among the retinue of the strangers to return in\nany haste to the cottage of Alice. Meantime her anxiety of mind seemed\nto increase with the agony of her body; and, to use the phrase of\nBabie, her only attendant, “she prayed powerfully that she might see\nher master's son once more, and renew her warning.” She died just as the\nclock in the distant village tolled one; and Ravenswood remembered, with\ninternal shuddering, that he had heard the chime sound through the wood\njust before he had seen what he was now much disposed to consider as the\nspectre of the deceased.\n\nIt was necessary, as well from his respect to the departed as in common\nhumanity to her terrified attendant, that he should take some measures\nto relieve the girl from her distressing situation. The deceased,\nhe understood, had expressed a desire to be buried in a solitary\nchurchyard, near the little inn of the Tod's Hole, called the Hermitage,\nor more commonly Armitage, in which lay interred some of the Ravenswood\nfamily, and many of their followers. Ravenswood conceived it his duty\nto gratify this predilection, commonly found to exist among the Scottish\npeasantry, and despatched Babie to the neighbouring village to procure\nthe assistance of some females, assuring her that, in the mean while, he\nwould himself remain with the dead body, which, as in Thessaly of old,\nit is accounted highly unfit to leave without a watch.\n\nThus, in the course of a quarter of an hour or little more, he found\nhimself sitting a solitary guard over the inanimate corpse of her whose\ndismissed spirit, unless his eyes had strangely deceived him, had so\nrecently manifested itself before him. Notwithstanding his natural\ncourage, the Master was considerably affected by a concurrence of\ncircumstances so extraordinary. “She died expressing her eager desire\nto see me. Can it be, then,” was his natural course of reflection--“can\nstrong and earnest wishes, formed during the last agony of nature,\nsurvive its catastrophe, surmount the awful bounds of the spiritual\nworld, and place before us its inhabitants in the hues and colouring of\nlife? And why was that manifested to the eye which could not unfold its\ntale to the ear? and wherefore should a breach be made in the laws\nof nature, yet its purpose remain unknown? Vain questions, which only\ndeath, when it shall make me like the pale and withered form before me,\ncan ever resolve.”\n\nHe laid a cloth, as he spoke, over the lifeless face, upon whose\nfeatures he felt unwilling any longer to dwell. He then took his place\nin an old carved oaken chair, ornamented with his own armorial bearings,\nwhich Alice had contrived to appropriate to her own use in the pillage\nwhich took place among creditors, officers, domestics, and messengers of\nthe law when his father left Ravenswood Castle for the last time. Thus\nseated, he banished, as much as he could, the superstitious feelings\nwhich the late incident naturally inspired. His own were sad enough,\nwithout the exaggeration of supernatural terror, since he found himself\ntransferred from the situation of a successful lover of Lucy Ashton, and\nan honoured and respected friend of her father, into the melancholy\nand solitary guardian of the abandoned and forsaken corpse of a common\npauper.\n\nHe was relieved, however, from his sad office sooner that he could\nreasonably have expected, considering the distance betwixt the hut of\nthe deceased and the village, and the age and infirmities of three old\nwomen who came from thence, in military phrase, to relieve guard upon\nthe body of the defunct. On any other occasion the speed of these\nreverend sibyls would have been much more moderate, for the first was\neighty years of age and upwards, the second was paralytic, and the third\nlame of a leg from some accident. But the burial duties rendered to the\ndeceased are, to the Scottish peasant of either sex, a labour of love.\nI know not whether it is from the temper of the people, grave and\nenthusiastic as it certainly is, or from the recollection of the ancient\nCatholic opinions, when the funeral rites were always considered as a\nperiod of festival to the living; but feasting, good cheer, and even\ninebriety, were, and are, the frequent accompaniments of a Scottish\nold-fashioned burial. What the funeral feast, or “dirgie,” as it is\ncalled, was to the men, the gloomy preparations of the dead body for the\ncoffin were to the women. To straight the contorted limbs upon a board\nused for that melancholy purpose, to array the corpse in clean linen,\nand over that in its woollen shroad, were operations committed always to\nthe old matrons of the village, and in which they found a singular and\ngloomy delight.\n\nThe old women paid the Master their salutations with a ghastly smile,\nwhich reminded him of the meeting betwixt Macbeth and the witches on\nthe blasted heath of Forres. He gave them some money, and recommended to\nthem the charge of the dead body of their contemporary, an office which\nthey willingly undertook; intimating to him at the same time that\nhe must leave the hut, in order that they might begin their mournful\nduties. Ravenswood readily agreed to depart, only tarrying to recommend\nto them due attention to the body, and to receive information where\nhe was to find the sexton, or beadle, who had in charge the deserted\nchurchyard of the Armitage, in order to prepare matters for the\nreception of Old Alice in the place of repose which she had selected for\nherself.\n\n“Ye'll no be pinched to find out Johnie Mortsheugh,” said the elder\nsibyl, and still her withered cheek bore a grisly smile; “he dwells near\nthe Tod's Hole, an house of entertainment where there has been mony a\nblythe birling, for death and drink-draining are near neighbours to ane\nanither.”\n\n“Ay! and that's e'en true, cummer,” said the lame hag, propping herself\nwith a crutch which supported the shortness of her left leg, “for I mind\nwhen the father of this Master of Ravenswood that is now standing before\nus sticked young Blackhall with his whinger, for a wrang word said ower\ntheir wine, or brandy, or what not: he gaed in as light as a lark, and\nhe came out wi' his feet foremost. I was at the winding of the corpse;\nand when the bluid was washed off, he was a bonny bouk of man's body.”\n It may be easily believed that this ill-timed anecdote hastened the\nMaster's purpose of quitting a company so evil-omened and so odious.\nYet, while walking to the tree to which his horse was tied, and busying\nhimself with adjusting the girths of the saddle, he could not avoid\nhearing, through the hedge of the little garden, a conversation\nrespecting himself, betwixt the lame woman and the octogenarian sibyl.\nThe pair had hobbled into the garden to gather rosemary, southernwood,\nrue, and other plants proper to be strewed upon the body, and burned by\nway of fumigation in the chimney of the cottage. The paralytic wretch,\nalmost exhausted by the journey, was left guard upon the corpse, lest\nwitches or fiends might play their sport with it.\n\nThe following law, croaking dialogue was necessarily overheard by the\nMaster of Ravenswood:\n\n“That's a fresh and full-grown hemlock, Annie Winnie; mony a cummer lang\nsyne wad hae sought nae better horse to flee over hill and how, through\nmist and moonlight, and light down in the King of France's cellar.”\n\n“Ay, cummer! but the very deil has turned as hard-hearted now as the\nLord Keeper and the grit folk, that hae breasts like whinstane. They\nprick us and they pine us, and they pit us on the pinnywinkles for\nwitches; and, if I say my prayers backwards ten times ower, Satan will\nnever gie me amends o' them.”\n\n“Did ye ever see the foul thief?” asked her neighbour.\n\n“Na!” replied the other spokeswoman; “but I trow I hae dreamed of him\nmony a time, and I think the day will come they will burn me for't. But\nne'er mind, cummer! we hae this dollar of the Master's, and we'll send\ndoun for bread and for yill, and tobacco, and a drap brandy to burn, and\na wee pickle saft sugar; and be there deil, or nae deil, lass, we'll hae\na merry night o't.”\n\nHere her leathern chops uttered a sort of cackling, ghastly laugh,\nresembling, to a certain degree, the cry of the screech-owl.\n\n“He's a frank man, and a free-handed man, the Master,” said Annie\nWinnie, “and a comely personage--broad in the shouthers, and narrow\naround the lunyies. He wad mak a bonny corpse; I wad like to hae the\nstreiking and winding o' him.”\n\n“It is written on his brow, Annie Winnie,” returned the octogenarian,\nher companion, “that hand of woman, or of man either, will never\nstraught him: dead-deal will never be laid on his back, make you your\nmarket of that, for I hae it frae a sure hand.”\n\n“Will it be his lot to die on the battle-ground then, Ailsie Gourlay?\nWill he die by the sword or the ball, as his forbears had dune before\nhim, mony ane o' them?” “Ask nae mair questions about it--he'll no be\ngraced sae far,” replied the sage.\n\n“I ken ye are wiser than ither folk, Aislie Gourlay. But wha tell'd ye\nthis?” “Fashna your thumb about that, Annie Winnie,” answered the sibyl,\n“I hae it frae a hand sure eneugh.”\n\n“But ye said ye never saw the foul thief,” reiterated her inquisitive\ncompanion.\n\n“I hae it frae as sure a hand,” said Ailsie, “and frae them that spaed\nhis fortune before the sark gaed ower his head.”\n\n“Hark! I hear his horse's feet riding aff,” said the other; “they dinna\nsound as if good luck was wi' them.”\n\n“Mak haste, sirs,” cried the paralytic hag from the cottage, “and let\nus do what is needfu', and say what is fitting; for, if the dead corpse\nbinna straughted, it will girn and thraw, and that will fear the best o'\nus.”\n\nRavenswood was now out of hearing. He despised most of the ordinary\nprejudices about witchcraft, omens, and vaticination, to which his age\nand country still gave such implicit credit that to express a doubt of\nthem was accounted a crime equal to the unbelief of Jews or Saracens; he\nknew also that the prevailing belief, concerning witches, operating\nupon the hypochondriac habits of those whom age, infirmity, and poverty\nrendered liable to suspicion, and enforced by the fear of death and the\npangs of the most cruel tortures, often extorted those confessions which\nencumber and disgrace the criminal records of Scotland during the 17th\ncentury. But the vision of that morning, whether real or imaginary,\nhad impressed his mind with a superstitious feeling which he in vain\nendeavoured to shake off. The nature of the business which awaited him\nat the little inn, called Tod's Hole, where he soon after arrived, was\nnot of a kind to restore his spirits.\n\nIt was necessary he should see Mortsheugh, the sexton of the old\nburial-ground at Armitage, to arrange matters for the funeral of Alice;\nand, as the man dwelt near the place of her late residence, the Master,\nafter a slight refreshment, walked towards the place where the body of\nAlice was to be deposited. It was situated in the nook formed by the\neddying sweep of a stream, which issued from the adjoining hills. A rude\ncavern in an adjacent rock, which, in the interior, was cut into the\nshape of a cross, formed the hermitage, where some Saxon saint had in\nancient times done penance, and given name to the place. The rich\nAbbey of Coldinghame had, in latter days, established a chapel in\nthe neighbourhood, of which no vestige was now visible, though the\nchurchyard which surrounded it was still, as upon the present occasion,\nused for the interment of particular persons. One or two shattered\nyew-trees still grew within the precincts of that which had once been\nholy ground. Warriors and barons had been buried there of old, but\ntheir names were forgotten, and their monuments demolished. The only\nsepulchral memorials which remained were the upright headstones which\nmark the graves of persons of inferior rank. The abode of the sexton was\na solitary cottage adjacent to the ruined wall of the cemetery, but so\nlow that, with its thatch, which nearly reached the ground, covered with\na thick crop of grass, fog, and house-leeks, it resembled an overgrown\ngrave. On inquiry, however, Ravenswood found that the man of the last\nmattock was absent at a bridal, being fiddler as well as grave-digger to\nthe vicinity. He therefore retired to the little inn, leaving a message\nthat early next morning he would again call for the person whose double\noccupation connected him at once with the house of mourning and the\nhouse of feasting.\n\nAn outrider of the Marquis arrived at Tod's Hole shortly after, with a\nmessage, intimating that his master would join Ravenswood at that place\non the following morning; and the Master, who would otherwise have\nproceeded to his old retreat at Wolf's Crag, remained there accordingly\nto give meeting to his noble kinsman.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n     Hamlet: Has this fellow no feeling of his business? he sings\n     at grave making.\n     Horatio:   Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.\n     Hamlet: 'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath the\n     daintier sense.\n\n     Hamlet, Act V. Scene 1.\n\nTHE sleep of Ravenswood was broken by ghastly and agitating visions, and\nhis waking intervals disturbed by melancholy reflections on the past and\npainful anticipations of the future. He was perhaps the only traveller\nwho ever slept in that miserable kennel without complaining of his\nlodgings, or feeling inconvenience from their deficiencies. It is when\n“the mind is free the body's delicate.” Morning, however, found the\nMaster an early riser, in hopes that the fresh air of the dawn might\nafford the refreshment which night had refused him. He took his way\ntowards the solitary burial-ground, which lay about half a mile from the\ninn.\n\nThe thin blue smoke, which already began to curl upward, and to\ndistinguish the cottage of the living from the habitation of the dead,\napprised him that its inmate had returned and was stirring. Accordingly,\non entering the little churchyard, he saw the old man labouring in a\nhalf-made grave. “My destiny,” thought Ravenswood, “seems to lead me to\nscenes of fate and of death; but these are childish thoughts, and they\nshall not master me. I will not again suffer my imagination to beguile\nmy senses.” The old man rested on his spade as the Master approached\nhim, as if to receive his commands; and as he did not immediately speak,\nthe sexton opened the discourse in his own way.\n\n“Ye will be a wedding customer, sir, I'se warrant?”\n\n“What makes you think so, friend?” replied the Master.\n\n“I live by twa trades, sir,” replied the blythe old man--“fiddle, sir,\nand spade; filling the world, and emptying of it; and I suld ken baith\ncast of customers by head-mark in thirty years' practice.”\n\n“You are mistaken, however, this morning,” replied Ravenswood.\n\n“Am I?” said the old man, looking keenly at him, “troth and it may be;\nsince, for as brent as your brow is, there is something sitting upon it\nthis day that is as near akin to death as to wedlock. Weel--weel; the\npick and shovel are as ready to your order as bow and fiddle.”\n\n“I wish you,” said Ravenswood, “to look after the decent interment\nof an old woman, Alice Gray, who lived at the Graigfoot in Ravenswood\nPark.”\n\n“Alice Gray!--blind Alice!” said the sexton; “and is she gane at last?\nthat's another jow of the bell to bid me be ready. I mind when Habbie\nGray brought her down to this land; a likely lass she was then,\nand looked ower her southland nose at us a'. I trow her pride got a\ndowncome. And is she e'en gane?”\n\n“She died yesterday,” said Ravenswood; “and desired to be buried here\nbeside her husband; you know where he lies, no doubt?”\n\n“Ken where he lies!” answered the sexton, with national indirection of\nresponse. “I ken whar a'body lies, that lies here. But ye were speaking\no' her grave? Lord help us, it's no an ordinar grave that will haud her\nin, if a's true that folk said of Alice in her auld days; and if I gae\nto six feet deep--and a warlock's grave shouldna be an inch mair ebb,\nor her ain witch cummers would soon whirl her out of her shroud for a'\ntheir auld acquaintance--and be't six feet, or be't three, wha's to pay\nthe making o't, I pray ye?”\n\n“I will pay that, my friend, and all other reasonable charges.”\n\n“Reasonable charges!” said the sexton; “ou, there's grundmail--and\nbell-siller, though the bell's broken, nae doubt--and the kist--and my\nday's wark--and my bit fee--and some brandy and yill to the dirgie, I am\nno thinking that you can inter her, to ca' decently, under saxteen pund\nScots.”\n\n“There is the money, my friend,” said Ravenswood, “and something over.\nBe sure you know the grave.”\n\n“Ye'll be ane o' her English relations, I'se warrant,” said the hoary\nman of skulls; “I hae heard she married far below her station. It was\nvery right to let her bite on the bridle when she was living, and it's\nvery right to gie her a decent burial now she's dead, for that's a\nmatter o' credit to yoursell rather than to her. Folk may let their\nkindred shift for themsells when they are alive, and can bear the burden\nof their ain misdoings; but it's an unnatural thing to let them be\nburied like dogs, when a' the discredit gangs to the kindred. What kens\nthe dead corpse about it?”\n\n“You would not have people neglect their relations on a bridal occasion\nneither?” said Ravenswood, who was amused with the professional\nlimitation of the grave-digger's philanthropy.\n\nThe old man cast up his sharp grey eyes with a shrewd smile, as if he\nunderstood the jest, but instantly continued, with his former gravity:\n“Bridals--wha wad neglect bridals that had ony regard for plenishing\nthe earth? To be sure, they suld be celebrated with all manner of good\ncheer, and meeting of friends, and musical instruments--harp,\nsackbut, and psaltery; or gude fiddle and pipes, when these auld-warld\ninstruments of melody are hard to be compassed.”\n\n“The presence of the fiddle, I dare say,” replied Ravenswood, “would\natone for the absence of all the others.”\n\nThe sexton again looked sharply up at him, as he answered. “Nae\ndoubt--nae doubt, if it were weel played; but yonder,” he said, as if\nto change the discourse, “is Halbert Gray's lang hame, that ye were\nspeering after, just the third bourock beyond the muckle through-stane\nthat stands on sax legs yonder, abune some ane of the Ravenswoods; for\nthere is mony of their kin and followers here, deil lift them! though it\nisna just their main burial-place.”\n\n“They are no favourites, then, of yours, these Ravenswoods?” said the\nMaster, no much pleased with the passing benediction which was thus\nbestowed on his family and name.\n\n“I kenna wha should favour them,” said the grave-digger; “when they\nhad lands and power, they were ill guides of them baith, and now their\nhead's down, there's few care how lang they may be of lifting it again.”\n\n“Indeed!” said Ravenswood; “I never heard that this unhappy family\ndeserved ill-will at the hands of their country. I grant their poverty,\nif that renders them contemptible.”\n\n“It will gang a far way till't” said the sexton of Hermitage, “ye may\ntak my word for that; at least, I ken naething else that suld mak myself\ncontemptible, and folk are far frae respecting me as they wad do if I\nlived in a twa-lofted sclated house. But as for the Ravenswoods, I hae\nseen three generations of them, and deil ane to mend other.”\n\n“I thought they had enjoyed a fair character in the country,” said their\ndescendant.\n\n“Character! Ou, ye see, sir,” said the sexton, “as for the auld gudesire\nbody of a lord, I lived on his land when I was a swanking young chield,\nand could hae blawn the trumpet wi' ony body, for I had wind eneugh\nthen; and touching this trumpeter Marine that I have heard play afore\nthe lords of the circuit, I wad hae made nae mair o' him than of a bairn\nand a bawbee whistle. I defy him to hae played 'Boot and saddle,'\nor 'Horse and away,' or 'Gallants, come trot,' with me; he hadna the\ntones.”\n\n“But what is all this to old Lord Ravenswood, my friend?” said the\nMaster, who, with an anxiety not unnatural in his circumstances, was\ndesirous of prosecuting the musician's first topic--“what had his memory\nto do with the degeneracy of the trumpet music?”\n\n“Just this, sir,” answered the sexton, “that I lost my wind in his\nservice. Ye see I was trumpeter at the castle, and had allowance for\nblawing at break of day, and at dinner time, and other whiles when\nthere was company about, and it pleased my lord; and when he raised his\nmilitia to caper awa' to Bothwell Brig against the wrang-headed westland\nWhigs, I behoved, reason or name, to munt a horse and caper awa' wi'\nthem.”\n\n“And very reasonable,” said Ravenswood; “you were his servant and\nvassal.”\n\n“Servitor, say ye?” replied the sexton, “and so I was; but it was to\nblaw folk to their warm dinner, or at the warst to a decent kirkyard,\nand no to skirl them awa' to a bluidy braeside, where there was deil a\nbedral but the hooded craw. But bide ye, ye shall hear what cam o't, and\nhow far I am bund to be bedesman to the Ravenswoods. Till't, ye see, we\ngaed on a braw simmer morning, twenty-fourth of June, saxteen hundred\nand se'enty-nine, of a' the days of the month and year--drums beat, guns\nrattled, horses kicked and trampled. Hackstoun of Rathillet keepit the\nbrig wi' mustket and carabine and pike, sword and scythe for what I ken,\nand we horsemen were ordered down to cross at the ford,--I hate fords\nat a' times, let abee when there's thousands of armed men on the other\nside. There was auld Ravenswood brandishing his Andrew Ferrara at the\nhead, and crying to us to come and buckle to, as if we had been gaun to\na fair; there was Caleb Balderstone, that is living yet, flourishing in\nthe rear, and swearing Gog and Magog, he would put steel through the guts\nof ony man that turned bridle; there was young Allan Ravenswood, that\nwas then Master, wi' a bended pistol in his hand--it was a mercy it gaed\nna aff!--crying to me, that had scarce as much wind left as serve the\nnecessary purpose of my ain lungs, 'Sound, you poltroon!--sound, you\ndamned cowardly villain, or I will blow your brains out!' and, to be\nsure, I blew sic points of war that the scraugh of a clockin-hen was\nmusic to them.”\n\n“Well, sir, cut all this short,” said Ravenswood.\n\n“Short! I had like to hae been cut short mysell, in the flower of my\nyouth, as Scripture says; and that's the very thing that I compleen o'.\nWeel! in to the water we behoved a' to splash, heels ower head, sit or\nfa'--ae horse driving on anither, as is the way of brute beasts, and\nriders that hae as little sense; the very bushes on the ither side were\na-bleeze wi' the flashes of the Whig guns; and my horse had just taen the\ngrund, when a blackavised westland carle--I wad mind the face o' him a\nhundred years yet--an ee like a wild falcon's, and a beard as broad\nas my shovel--clapped the end o' his lang black gun within a quarter's\nlength of my lug! By the grace o' Mercy, the horse swarved round, and I\nfell aff at the tae side as the ball whistled by at the tither, and the\nfell auld lord took the Whig such a swauk wi' his broadsword that he\nmade twa pieces o' his head, and down fell the lurdance wi' a' his bouk\nabune me.”\n\n“You were rather obliged to the old lord, I think,” said Ravenswood.\n\n“Was I? my sartie! first for bringing me into jeopardy, would I nould I,\nand then for whomling a chield on the tap o' me that dang the very wind\nout of my body? I hae been short-breathed ever since, and canna gang\ntwenty yards without peghing like a miller's aiver.”\n\n“You lost, then, your place as trumpeter?” said Ravenswood.\n\n“Lost it! to be sure I lost it,” replied the sexton, “for I couldna hae\nplayed pew upon a dry hemlock; but I might hae dune weel eneugh, for\nI keepit the wage and the free house, and little to do but play on the\nfiddle to them, but for Allan, last Lord Ravenswood, that was far waur\nthan ever his father was.”\n\n“What,” said the Master, “did my father--I mean, did his father's\nson--this last Lord Ravenswood, deprive you of what the bounty of his\nfather allowed you?”\n\n“Ay, troth did he,” answered the old man; “for he loot his affairs gang\nto the dogs, and let in this Sir William Ashton on us, that will gie\nnaething for naething, and just removed me and a' the puir creatures\nthat had bite and soup at the castle, and a hole to put our heads in,\nwhen things were in the auld way.”\n\n“If Lord Ravenswood protected his people, my friend, while he had the\nmeans of doing so, I think they might spare his memory,” replied the\nMaster.\n\n“Ye are welcome to your ain opinion, sir,” said the sexton; “but ye\nwinna persuade me that he did his duty, either to himsell or to huz puir\ndependent creatures, in guiding us the gate he has done; he might hae\ngien us life-rent tacks of our bits o' houses and yards; and me, that's\nan auld man, living in yon miserable cabin, that's fitter for the dead\nthan the quick, and killed wi' rheumatise, and John Smith in my dainty\nbit mailing, and his window glazen, and a' because Ravenswood guided his\ngear like a fule!”\n\n“It is but too true,” said Ravenswood, conscience-struck; “the penalties\nof extravagance extend far beyond the prodigal's own sufferings.”\n “However,” said the sexton, “this young man Edgar is like to avenge my\nwrangs on the haill of his kindred.” “Indeed?” said Ravenswood; “why\nshould you suppose so?”\n\n“They say he is about to marry the daughter of Leddy Ashton; and let her\nleddyship get his head ance under her oxter, and see you if she winna\ngie his neck a thraw. Sorra a bit, if I were him! Let her alane for\nhauding a'thing in het water that draws near her. Sae the warst wish I\nshall wish the lad is, that he may take his ain creditable gate o't, and\nally himsell wi' his father's enemies, that have taken his broad lands\nand my bonny kail-yard from the lawful owners thereof.”\n\nCervantes acutely remarks, that flattery is pleasing even from the mouth\nof a madman; and censure, as well as praise, often affects us, while we\ndespise the opinions and motives on which it is founded and expressed.\nRavenswood, abruptly reiterating his command that Alice's funeral should\nbe attended to, flung away from the sexton, under the painful impression\nthat the great as well as the small vulgar would think of his engagement\nwith Lucy like this ignorant and selfish peasant.\n\n“And I have stooped to subject myself to these calumnies, and am\nrejected notwithstanding! Lucy, your faith must be true and perfect as\nthe diamond to compensate for the dishonour which men's opinions, and\nthe conduct of your mother, attach to the heir of Ravenswood!”\n\nAs he raised his eyes, he beheld the Marquis of A----, who, having\narrived at the Tod's Hole, had walked forth to look for his kinsman.\n\nAfter mutual greetings, he made some apology to the Master for not\ncoming forward on the preceding evening. “It was his wish,” he said,\n“to have done so, but he had come to the knowledge of some matters which\ninduced him to delay his purpose. I find,” he proceeded, “there has been\na love affair here, kinsman; and though I might blame you for not\nhaving communicated with me, as being in some degree the chief of your\nfamily----”\n\n“With your lordship's permission,” said Ravenswood, “I am deeply\ngrateful for the interest you are pleased to take in me, but _I_ am the\nchief and head of my family.”\n\n“I know it--I know it,” said the Marquis; “in a strict heraldic and\ngenealogical sense, you certainly are so; what I mean is, that being in\nsome measure under my guardianship----”\n\n“I must take the liberty to say, my lord----” answered Ravenswood, and\nthe tone in which he interrupted the Marquis boded no long duration to\nthe friendship of the noble relatives, when he himself was interrupted\nby the little sexton, who cam puffing after them, to ask if their\nhonours would choose music at the change-house to make up for short\ncheer.\n\n“We want no music,” said the Master, abruptly.\n\n“Your honour disna ken what ye're refusing, then,” said the fiddler,\nwith the impertinent freedom of his profession. “I can play, 'Wilt thou\ndo't again,' and 'The Auld Man's Mear's Dead,' sax times better than\never Patie Birnie. I'll get my fiddle in the turning of a coffin-screw.”\n\n“Take yourself away, sir,” said the Marquis.\n\n“And if your honour be a north-country gentleman,” said the persevering\nminstrel, “whilk I wad judge from your tongue, I can play 'Liggeram\nCosh,' and 'Mullin Dhu,' and 'The Cummers of Athole.'”\n\n“Take yourself away, friend; you interrupt our conversation.”\n\n“Or if, under your honour's favour, ye should happen to be a\nthought honest, I can play (this in a low and confidential tone)\n'Killiecrankie,' and 'The King shall hae his ain,' and 'The Auld Stuarts\nback again'; and the wife at the change-house is a decent, discreet\nbody, neither kens nor cares what toasts are drucken, and what tunes\nare played, in her house: she's deaf to a'thing but the clink o' the\nsiller.”\n\nThe Marquis, who was sometimes suspected of Jacobitism, could not help\nlaughing as he threw the fellow a dollar, and bid him go play to the\nservants if he had a mind, and leave them at peace.\n\n“Aweel, gentlemen,” said he, “I am wishing your honours gude day. I'll\nbe a' the better of the dollar, and ye'll be the waur of wanting music,\nI'se tell ye. But I'se gang hame, and finish the grave in the tuning o'\na fiddle-string, lay by my spade, and then get my tother bread-winner,\nand awa' to your folk, and see if they hae better lugs than their\nmasters.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n     True love, an thou be true,\n     Thou has ane kittle part to play;\n     For fortune, fashion, fancy, and thou,\n     Maun strive for many a day.\n\n     I've kend by mony a friend's tale,\n     Far better by this heart of mine,\n     What time and change of fancy avail\n     A true-love knot to untwine.\n\n     HENDERSOUN.\n\n“I WISHED to tell you, my good kinsman,” said the Marquis, “now that we\nare quit of that impertinent fiddler, that I had tried to discuss this\nlove affair of yours with Sir William Ashton's daughter. I never saw\nthe young lady but for a few minutes to-day; so, being a stranger to her\npersonal merits, I pay a compliment to you, and offer her no offence, in\nsaying you might do better.”\n\n“My lord, I am much indebted for the interest you have taken in my\naffairs,” said Ravenswood. “I did not intend to have troubled you in any\nmatter concerning Miss Ashton. As my engagement with that young lady has\nreached your lordship, I can only say, that you must necessarily suppose\nthat I was aware of the objections to my marrying into her father's\nfamily, and of course must have been completely satisfied with the\nreasons by which these objections are overbalanced, since I have\nproceeded so far in the matter.”\n\n“Nay, Master, if you had heard me out,” said his noble relation, “you\nmight have spared that observation; for, without questioning that you\nhad reasons which seemed to you to counterbalance every other obstacle,\nI set myself, by every means that it became me to use towards the\nAshtons, to persuade them to meet your views.”\n\n“I am obliged to your lordship for your unsolicited intercession,” said\nRavenswood; “especially as I am sure your lordship would never carry it\nbeyond the bounds which it became me to use.”\n\n“Of that,” said the Marquis, “you may be confident; I myself felt the\ndelicacy of the matter too much to place a gentleman nearly connected\nwith my house in a degrading or dubious situation with these Ashtons.\nBut I pointed out all the advantages of their marrying their daughter\ninto a house so honourable, and so nearly related with the first of\nScotland; I explained the exact degree of relationship in which the\nRavenswoods stand to ourselves; and I even hinted how political matters\nwere like to turn, and what cards would be trumps next Parliament. I\nsaid I regarded you as a son--or a nephew, or so--rather than as a more\ndistant relation; and that I made your affair entirely my own.”\n\n“And what was the issue of your lordship's explanation?” said\nRavenswood, in some doubt whether he should resent or express gratitude\nfor his interference.\n\n“Why, the Lord Keeper would have listened to reason,” said the Marquis;\n“he is rather unwilling to leave his place, which, in the present view\nof a change, must be vacated; and, to say truth, he seemed to have\na liking for you, and to be sensible of the general advantages to be\nattained by such a match. But his lady, who is tongue of the trump,\nMaster----”\n\n“What of Lady Ashton, my lord?” said Ravenswood; “let me know the issue\nof this extraordinary conference: I can bear it.”\n\n“I am glad of that, kinsman,” said the Marquis, “for I am ashamed to\ntell you half what she said. It is enough--her mind is made up, and the\nmistress of a first-rate boarding-school could not have rejected\nwith more haughty indifference the suit of a half-pay Irish officer,\nbeseeching permission to wait upon the heiress of a West India planter,\nthan Lady Ashton spurned every proposal of mediation which it could at\nall become me to offer in behalf of you, my good kinsman. I cannot guess\nwhat she means. A more honourable connexion she could not form, that's\ncertain. As for money and land, that used to be her husband's business\nrather than hers; I really think she hates you for having the rank\nwhich her husband has not, and perhaps for not having the lands that her\ngoodman has. But I should only vex you to say more about it--here we are\nat the change-house.”\n\nThe Master of Ravenswood paused as he entered the cottage, which reeked\nthrough all its crevices, and they were not few, from the exertions of\nthe Marquis's travelling-cooks to supply good cheer, and spread, as it\nwere, a table in the wilderness.\n\n“My Lord Marquis,” said Ravenswood, “I already mentioned that accident\nhas put your lordship in possession of a secret which, with my consent,\nshould have remained one even to you, my kinsman, for some time. Since\nthe secret was to part from my own custody, and that of the only person\nbesides who was interested in it, I am not sorry it should have reached\nyour lordship's ears, as being fully aware that you are my noble kinsman\nand friend.”\n\n“You may believe it is safely lodged with me, Master of Ravenswood,”\n said the Marquis; “but I should like well to hear you say that you\nrenounced the idea of an alliance which you can hardly pursue without a\ncertain degree of degradation.”\n\n“Of that, my lord, I shall judge,” answered Ravenswood, “and I hope with\ndelicacy as sensitive as any of my friends. But I have no engagement\nwith Sir William and Lady Ashton. It is with Miss Ashton alone that I\nhave entered upon the subject, and my conduct in the matter shall be\nentirely ruled by hers. If she continues to prefer me in my poverty to\nthe wealthier suitors whom her friends recommend, I may well make some\nsacrifice to her sincere affection: I may well surrender to her the\nless tangible and less palpable advantages of birth, and the deep-rooted\nprejudices of family hatred. If Miss Lucy Ashton should change her mind\non a subject of such delicacy, I trust my friends will be silent on my\ndisappointment, and I shall know how to make my enemies so.”\n\n“Spoke like a gallant young nobleman,” said the Marquis; “for my part, I\nhave that regard for you, that I should be sorry the thing went on. This\nSir William Ashton was a pretty enough pettifogging kind of a lawyer\ntwenty years ago, and betwixt battling at the bar and leading in\ncommittees of Parliament he has got well on; the Darien matter lent him\na lift, for he had good intelligence and sound views, and sold out in\ntime; but the best work is had out of him. No government will take him\nat his own, or rather his wife's extravagant, valuation; and betwixt his\nindecision and her insolence, from all I can guess, he will outsit his\nmarket, and be had cheap when no one will bid for him. I say nothing\nof Miss Ashton; but I assure you, a connexion with her father will be\nneither useful nor ornamental, beyond that part of your father's spoils\nwhich he may be prevailed upon to disgorge by way of tocher-good; and\ntake my word for it, you will get more if you have spirit to bell the\ncat with him in the House of Peers. And I will be the man, cousin,”\n continued his lordship, “will course the fox for you, and make him rue\nthe day that ever he refused a composition too honourable for him, and\nproposed by me on the behalf of a kinsman.”\n\nThere was something in all this that, as it were, overshot the mark.\nRavenswood could not disguise from himself that his noble kinsman\nhad more reasons for taking offence at the reception of his suit than\nregarded his interest and honour, yet he could neither complain nor be\nsurprised that it should be so. He contented himself, therefore, with\nrepeating, that his attachment was to Miss Ashton personally; that he\ndesired neither wealth nor aggrandisement from her father's means and\ninfluence; and that nothing should prevent his keeping his engagement,\nexcepting her own express desire that it should be relinquished; and he\nrequested as a favour that the matter might be no more mentioned betwixt\nthem at present, assuring the Marquis of A----that he should be his\nconfidant or its interruption.\n\nThe Marquis soon had more agreeable, as well as more interesting,\nsubjects on which to converse. A foot-post, who had followed him from\nEdinburgh to Ravenswood Castle, and had traced his steps to the\nTod's Hole, brought him a packet laden with good news. The political\ncalculations of the Marquis had proved just, both in London and at\nEdinburgh, and he saw almost within his grasp the pre-eminence for which\nhe had panted. The refreshments which the servants had prepared were now\nput on the table, and an epicure would perhaps have enjoyed them with\nadditional zest from the contrast which such fare afforded to the\nmiserable cabin in which it was served up.\n\nThe turn of conversation corresponded with and added to the social\nfeelings of the company. The Marquis expanded with pleasure on the power\nwhich probably incidents were likely to assign to him, and on the\nuse which eh hoped to make of it in serving his kinsman Ravenswood.\nRavenswood could but repeat the gratitude which he really felt, even\nwhen he considered the topic as too long dwelt upon. The wine was\nexcellent, notwithstanding its having been brought in a runlet from\nEdinburgh; and the habits of the Marquis, when engaged with such good\ncheer, were somewhat sedentary. And so it fell out that they delayed\ntheir journey two hours later than was their original purpose.\n\n“But what of that, my good young friend?” said the Marquis. “Your Castle\nof Wolf's Crag is at but five or six miles' distance, and will afford\nthe same hospitality to your kinsman of A----that it gave to this same\nSir William Ashton.”\n\n“Sir William took the castle by storm,” said Ravenswood, “and, like many\na victor, had little reason to congratulate himself on his conquest.”\n “Well--well!” said Lord A----, whose dignity was something relaxed by\nthe wine he had drunk, “I see I must bribe you to harbour me. Come,\npledge me in a bumper health to the last young lady that slept at Wolf's\nCrag, and liked her quarters. My bones are not so tender as hers, and I\nam resolved to occupy her apartment to-night, that I may judge how hard\nthe couch is that love can soften.”\n\n“Your lordship may choose what penance you please,” said Ravenswood;\n“but I assure you, I should expect my old servant to hang himself, or\nthrow himself from the battlements, should your lordship visit him so\nunexpectedly. I do assure you, we are totally and literally unprovided.”\n\nBut his declaration only brought from his noble patron an assurance of\nhis own total indifference as to every species of accommodation, and his\ndetermination to see the Tower of Wolf's Crag. His ancestor, he\nsaid, had been feasted there, when he went forward with the then Lord\nRavenswood to the fatal battle of Flodden, in which they both fell. Thus\nhard pressed, the Master offered to ride forward to get matters put in\nsuch preparation as time and circumstances admitted; but the Marquis\nprotested his kinsman must afford him his company, and would only\nconsent that an avant-courier should carry to the desinted seneschal,\nCaleb Balderstone, the unexpected news of this invasion.\n\nThe Master of Ravenswood soon after accompanied the Marquis in his\ncarriage, as the latter had proposed; and when they became better\nacquainted in the progress of the journey, his noble relation explained\nthe very liberal views which he entertained for his relation's\npreferment, in case of the success of his own political schemes. They\nrelated to a secret and highly important commission beyond sea, which\ncould only be entrusted to a person of rank, talent, and perfect\nconfidence, and which, as it required great trust and reliance on the\nenvoy employed, could but not prove both honourable and advantageous to\nhim. We need not enter into the nature and purpose of this commission,\nfarther than to acquaint our readers that the charge was in prospect\nhighly acceptable to the Master of Ravenswood, who hailed with pleasure\nthe hope of emerging from his present state of indigence and inaction\ninto independence and honourable exertion.\n\nWhile he listened thus eagerly to the details with which the Marquis\nnow thought it necessary to entrust him, the messenger who had been\ndespatched to the Tower of Wolf's Crag returned with Caleb Balderstone's\nhumble duty, and an assurance that “a' should be in seemly order, sic as\nthe hurry of time permitted, to receive their lordships as it behoved.”\n\nRavenswood was too well accustomed to his seneschal's mode of acting and\nspeaking to hope much from this confident assurance. He knew that Caleb\nacted upon the principle of the Spanish generals, in the campaign\nof ----, who, much to the perplexity of the Prince of Orange, their\ncommander-in-chief, used to report their troops as full in number,\nand possessed of all necessary points of equipment, not considering it\nconsistent with their dignity, or the honour of Spain, to confess\nany deficiency either in men or munition, until the want of both was\nunavoidably discovered in the day of battle. Accordingly, Ravenswood\nthought it necessary to give the Marquis some hint that the fair\nassurance which they had just received from Caleb did not by any means\nensure them against a very indifferent reception.\n\n“You do yourself injustice, Master,” said the Marquis, “or you wish\nto surprise me agreeably. From this window I see a great light in the\ndirection where, if I remember aright, Wolf's Crag lies; and, to judge\nfrom the splendour which the old Tower sheds around it, the preparations\nfor our reception must be of no ordinary description. I remember your\nfather putting the same deception on me, when we went to the Tower for\na few days' hawking, about twenty years since, and yet we spent our time\nas jollily at Wolf's Crag as we could have done at my own hunting seat\nat B----.”\n\n“Your lordship, I fear, will experience that the faculty of the\npresent proprietor to entertain his friends is greatly abridged,” said\nRavenswood; “the will, I need hardly say, remains the same. But I am as\nmuch at a loss as your lordship to account for so strong and brilliant a\nlight as is now above Wolf's Crag; the windows of the Tower are few and\nnarrow, and those of the lower story are hidden from us by the walls of\nthe court. I cannot conceive that any illumination of an ordinary nature\ncould afford such a blaze of light.”\n\nThe mystery was soon explained; for the cavalcade almost instantly\nhalted, and the voice of Caleb Balderstone was heard at the coach\nwindow, exclaiming, in accents broken by grief and fear, “Och,\ngentlemen! Och, my gude lords! Och, haud to the right! Wolf's Crag is\nburning, bower and ha'--a' the rich plenishing outside and inside--a'\nthe fine graith, pictures, tapestries, needle-wark, hangings, and other\ndecorements--a' in a bleeze, as if they were nae mair than sae mony\npeats, or as muckle pease-strae! Haud to the right, gentlemen, I implore\nye; there is some sma' provision making at Luckie Sma'trash's; but oh,\nwae for this night, and wae for me that lives to see it!”\n\nRavenswood was first stunned by this new and unexpected calamity; but\nafter a moment's recollection he sprang from the carriage, and hastily\nbidding his noble kinsman good-night, was about to ascend the hill\ntowards the castle, the broad and full conflagration of which now flung\nforth a high column of red light, that flickered far to seaward upon the\ndashing waves of the ocean.\n\n“Take a horse, Master,” exclaimed the Marquis, greatly affected by this\nadditional misfortune, so unexpectedly heaped upon his young protege;\n“and give me my ambling palfrey; and haste forward, you knaves, to see\nwhat can be done to save the furniture, or to extinguish the fire--ride,\nyou knaves, for your lives!”\n\nThe attendants bustled together, and began to strike their horses with\nthe spur, and call upon Caleb to show them the road. But the voice\nof that careful seneschal was heard above the tumult, “Oh, stop sirs,\nstop--turn bridle, for the luve of Mercy; add not loss of lives to the\nloss of warld's gean! Thirty barrels of powther, landed out of a Dunkirk\ndogger in the auld lord's time--a' in the vau'ts of the auld tower,--the\nfire canna be far off it, I trow. Lord's sake, to the right, lads--to\nthe right; let's pit the hill atween us and peril,--a wap wi' a\ncorner-stane o' Wolf's Crag wad defy the doctor!”\n\nIt will readily be supposed that this annunciation hurried the Marquis\nand his attendants into the route which Caleb prescribed, dragging\nRavenswood along with them, although there was much in the matter which\nhe could not possibly comprehend. “Gunpowder!” he exclaimed, laying hold\nof Caleb, who in vain endeavoured to escape from him; “what gunpowder?\nHow any quantity of powder could be in Wolf's Crag without my knowledge,\nI cannot possibly comprehend.”\n\n“But I can,” interrupted the Marquis, whispering him, “I can comprehend\nit thoroughly; for God's sake, ask him no more questions at present.”\n\n“There it is, now,” said Caleb, extricating himself from his master, and\nadjusting his dress, “your honour will believe his lordship's honourable\ntestimony. His lordship minds weel how, in the year that him they ca'd\nKing Willie died----”\n\n“Hush! hush, my good friend!” said the Marquis; “I shall satisfy your\nmaster upon that subject.”\n\n“And the people at Wolf's Hope,” said Ravenswood, “did none of them come\nto your assistance before the flame got so high?”\n\n“Ay did they, mony ane of them, the rapscallions!” said Caleb; “but\ntruly I was in nae hurry to let them into the Tower, where there were so\nmuch plate and valuables.”\n\n“Confound you for an impudent liar!” said Ravenswood, in uncontrollable\nire, “there was not a single ounce of----”\n\n“Forbye,” said the butler, most irreverently raising his voice to a\npitch which drowned his master's, “the fire made fast on us, owing to\nthe store of tapestry and carved timmer in the banqueting-ha', and the\nloons ran like scaulded rats sae sune as they heard of the gunpouther.”\n\n“I do entreat,” said the Marquis to Ravenswood, “you will ask him no\nmore questions.”\n\n“Only one, my lord. What has become of poor Mysie?”\n\n“Mysie!” said Caleb, “I had nae time to look about ony Mysie; she's\nin the Tower, I'se warrant, biding her awful doom.” “By heaven,” said\nRavenswood, “I do not understand all this! The life of a faithful old\ncreature is at stake; my lord, I will be withheld no longer; I will at\nleast ride up, and see whether the danger is as imminent as this old\nfool pretends.”\n\n“Weel, then, as I live by bread,” said Caleb, “Mysie is weel and safe.\nI saw her out of the castle before I left it mysell. Was I ganging to\nforget an auld fellow-servant?”\n\n“What made you tell me the contrary this moment?” said his master.\n\n“Did I tell you the contrary?” said Caleb; “then I maun hae been\ndreaming surely, or this awsome night has turned my judgment; but safe\nshe is, and ne'er a living soul in the castle, a' the better for them:\nthey wau have gotten an unco heezy.”\n\nThe Master of Ravenswood, upon this assurance being solemnly reiterated,\nand notwithstanding his extreme wish to witness the last explosion,\nwhich was to ruin to the ground the mansion of his fathers, suffered\nhimself to be dragged onward towards the village of Wolf's Hope, where\nnot only the change-house, but that of our well-known friend the cooper,\nwere all prepared for reception of himself and his noble guest, with a\nliberality of provision which requires some explanation.\n\nWe omitted to mention in its place, that Lockhard having fished out the\ntruth concerning the mode by which Caleb had obtained the supplies for\nhis banquet, the Lord Keeper, amused with the incident, and desirous at\nthe time to gratify Ravenswood, had recommended the cooper of Wolf's\nHope to the official situation under government the prospect of which\nhad reconciled him to the loss of his wild-fowl. Mr. Girder's preferment\nhad occasioned a pleasing surprise to old Caleb; for when, some days\nafter his master's departure, he found himself absolutely compelled, by\nsome necessary business, to visit the fishing hamlet, and was gliding\nlike a ghost past the door of the cooper, for fear of being summoned to\ngive some account of the progress of the solicitation in his favour, or,\nmore probably that the inmates might upbraid him with the false hope\nhe had held out upon the subject, he heard himself, not without some\napprehension, summoned at once in treble, tenor, and bass--a trio\nperformed by the voices of Mrs. Girder, old Dame Loup-the-Dyke, and the\ngoodman of the dwelling--“Mr. Caleb!--Mr. Caleb Balderstone! I hope\nye arena ganging dry-lipped by our door, and we sae muckle indebted to\nyou?”\n\nThis might be said ironically as well as in earnest. Caleb augured the\nworst, turned a deaf ear to the trio aforesaid, and was moving doggedly\non, his ancient castor pulled over his brows, and his eyes bent on the\nground, as if to count the flinty pebbles with which the rude pathway\nwas causewayed. But on a sudden he found himself surrounded in his\nprogress, like a stately merchantman in the Gut of Gibraltar (I hope\nthe ladies will excuse the tarpaulin phrase) by three Algerine galleys.\n“Gude guide us, Mr. Balderstone!” said Mrs. Girder. “Wha wad hae thought\nit of an auld and kenn'd friend!” said the mother.\n\n“And no sae muckle as stay to receive our thanks,” said the cooper\nhimself, “and frae the like o' me that seldom offers them! I am sure I\nhope there's nae ill seed sawn between us, Mr. Balderstone. Ony man that\nhas said to ye I am no gratefu' for the situation of Queen's cooper, let\nme hae a whample at him wi' mine eatche, that's a'.”\n\n“My good friends--my dear friends,” said Caleb, still doubting how the\ncertainty of the matter might stand, “what needs a' this ceremony? Ane\ntries to serve their friends, and sometimes they may happen to prosper,\nand sometimes to misgie. Naething I care to be fashed wi' less than\nthanks; I never could bide them.”\n\n“Faith, Mr. Balderstone, ye suld hae been fashed wi' few o' mine,” said\nthe downright man of staves and hoops, “if I had only your gude-will to\nthank ye for: I suld e'en hae set the guse, and the wild deukes, adn the\nrunlet of sack to balance that account. Gude-will, man, is a geizen'd\ntub, that hauds in nae liquor; but gude deed's like the cask, tight,\nround, and sound, that will haud liquor for the king.”\n\n“Have ye no heard of our letter,” said the mother-in-law, “making our\nJohn [Gibbie] the Queen's cooper for certain? and scarce a chield that\nhad ever hammered gird upon tub but was applying for it?”\n\n“Have I heard!!!” said Caleb, who now found how the wind set, with an\naccent of exceeding contempt, at the doubt expressed--“have I heard,\nquo'she!!!” and as he spoke he changed his shambling, skulking, dodging\npace into a manly and authoritative step, readjusted his cocked hat,\nand suffered his brow to emerge from under it in all the pride of\naristocracy, like the sun from behind a cloud.\n\n“To be sure, he canna but hae heard,” said the good woman.\n\n“Ay, to be sure it's impossible but I should,” said Caleb; “and sae I'll\nbe the first to kiss ye, joe, and wish you, cooper, much joy of your\npreferment, naething doubting but ye ken wha are your friends, and HAVE\nhelped ye, and CAN help ye. I thought it right to look a wee strange\nupon it at first,” added Caleb, “just to see if ye were made of the\nright mettle; but ye ring true, lad--ye ring true!”\n\nSo saying, with a most lordly air he kissed the women, and abandoned\nhis hand, with an air of serene patronage, to the hearty shake of\nMr. Girder's horn-hard palm. Upon this complete, and to Caleb most\nsatisfactory, information he did not, it may readily be believed,\nhesitate to accept an invitation to a solemn feast, to which were\ninvited, not only all the NOTABLES of the village, but even his ancient\nantagonist, Mr. Dingwall, himself. At this festivity he was, of course,\nthe most welcome and most honoured guest; and so well did he ply the\ncompany with stories of what he could do with his master, his master\nwith the Lord Keeper, the Lord Keeper with the council, and the council\nwith the king [queen], that before the company dismissed (which was,\nindeed, rather at an early hour than a late one), every man of note in\nthe village was ascending to the top-gallant of some ideal preferment by\nthe ladder of ropes which Caleb had presented to their imagination. Nay,\nthe cunning butler regained in that moment not only all the influence he\npossessed formerly over the villagers, when the baronial family which\nhe served were at the proudest, but acquired even an accession of\nimportance. The writer--the very attorney himself, such is the thirst of\npreferment--felt the force of the attraction, and taking an opportunity\nto draw Caleb into a corner, spoke, with affectionate regret, of the\ndeclining health of the sheriff-clerk of the county.\n\n“An excellent man--a most valuable man, Mr. Caleb; but fat sall I say!\nwe are peer feckless bodies, here the day and awa' by cock-screech the\nmorn; and if he failyies, there maun be somebody in his place; and gif\nthat ye could airt it my way, I sall be thankful, man--a gluve stuffed\nwi gowd nobles; an' hark ye, man something canny till yoursell, and the\nWolf's Hope carles to settle kindly wi' the Master of Ravenswood--that\nis, Lord Ravenswood--God bless his lordship!”\n\nA smile, and a hearty squeeze by the hand, was the suitable answer to\nthis overture; and Caleb made his escape from the jovial party, in order\nto avoid committing himself by any special promises.\n\n“The Lord be gude to me,” said Caleb, when he found himself in the open\nair, and at liberty to give vent to the self-exultation with which\nhe was, as it were, distended; “did ever ony man see sic a set of\ngreen-gaislings? The very pickmaws and solan-geese out-bye yonder at\nthe Bass hae ten times their sense! God, an I had been the Lord High\nCommissioner to the Estates o' Parliament, they couldna hae beflumm'd\nme mair; and, to speak Heaven's truth, I could hardly hae beflumm'd them\nbetter neither! But the writer--ha! ha! ha!--ah, ha! ha! ha! mercy on\nme, that I suld live in my auld days to gie the ganag-bye to the very\nwriter! Sheriff-clerk!!! But I hae an auld account to settle wi' the\ncarle; and to make amends for bye-ganes, the office shall just cost him\nas much time-serving and tide-serving as if he were to get it in gude\nearnest, of whilk there is sma' appearance, unless the Master learns\nmair the ways of this warld, whilk it is muckle to be doubted that he\nnever will do.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n     Why flames yon far summit--why shoot to the blast\n     Those embers, like stars from the firmament cast?\n     'Tis the fire-shower of ruin, all dreadfully driven\n     From thine eyrie, that beacons the darkness of Heaven.\n\n     CAMPBELL.\n\nTHE circumstances announced in the conclusion of the last chapter will\naccount for the ready and cheerful reception of the Marquis of A---- and\nthe Master of Ravenswood in the village of Wolf's Hope. In fact, Caleb\nhad no sooner announced the conflagration of the tower than the whole\nhamlet were upon foot to hasten to extinguish the flames. And although\nthat zealous adherent diverted their zeal by intimating the formidable\ncontents of the subterranean apartments, yet the check only turned their\nassiduity into another direction. Never had there been such slaughtering\nof capons, and fat geese, and barndoor fowls; never such boiling of\n“reested” hams; never such making of car-cakes and sweet scones, Selkirk\nbannocks, cookies, and petticoat-tails--delicacies little known to the\npresent generation. Never had there been such a tapping of barrels, and\nsuch uncorking of greybeards, in the village of Wolf's Hope. All the\ninferior houses were thrown open for the reception of the Marquis's\ndependants, who came, it was thought, as precursors of the shower of\npreferment which hereafter was to leave the rest of Scotland dry,\nin order to distil its rich dews on the village of Wolf's Hope under\nLammermoor. The minister put in his claim to have the guests of\ndistinction lodged at the manse, having his eye, it was thought, upon\na neighbouring preferment, where the incumbent was sickly; but Mr.\nBalderstone destined that honour to the cooper, his wife, and wife's\nmother, who danced for joy at the preferences thus assigned them.\n\nMany a beck and many a bow welcomed these noble guests to as good\nentertainment as persons of such rank could set before such visitors;\nand the old dame, who had formerly lived in Ravenswood Castle, and\nknew, as she said, the ways of the nobility, was in no whit wanting in\narranging matters, as well as circumstances permitted, according to the\netiquette of the times. The cooper's house was so roomy that each guest\nhad his separate retiring-room, to which they were ushered with all due\nceremony, while the plentiful supper was in the act of being placed upon\nthe table.\n\nRavenswood no sooner found himself alone than, impelled by a thousand\nfeelings, he left the apartment, the house, and the village, and hastily\nretraced his steps to the brow of the hill, which rose betwixt the\nvillage and screened it from the tower, in order to view the final fall\nof the house of his fathers. Some idle boys from the hamlet had taken\nthe same direction out of curiosity, having first witnessed the arrival\nof the coach and six and its attendants. As they ran one by one past the\nMaster, calling to each other to “Come and see the auld tower blaw up in\nthe lift like the peelings of an ingan,” he could not but feel himself\nmoved with indignation. “And these are the sons of my father's vassals,”\n he said--“of men bound, both by law and gratitude, to follow our steps\nthrough battle, and fire, and flood; and now the destruction of their\nliege lord's house is but a holiday's sight to them.”\n\nThese exasperating reflections were partly expresssed in the acrimony\nwith which he exclaimed, on feeling himself pulled by the cloak: “What\ndo you want, you dog?”\n\n“I am a dog, and an auld dog too,” answered Caleb, for it was he who had\ntaken the freedom, “and I am like to get a dog's wages; but it does not\nsignification a pinch of sneesing, for I am ower auld a dog to learn new\ntricks, or to follow a new master.”\n\nAs he spoke, Ravenswood attained the ridge of the hill from which Wolf's\nCrag was visible; the flames had entirely sunk down, and, to his great\nsurprise, there was only a dusky reddening upon the clouds immediately\nover the castle, which seemed the reflection of the embers of the sunken\nfire.\n\n“The place cannot have blown up,” said the Master; “we must have heard\nthe report: if a quarter of the gunpowder was there you tell me of, it\nwould have been heard twenty miles off.”\n\n“It've very like it wad,” said Balderstone, composedly.\n\n“Then the fire cannot have reached the vaults?”\n\n“It's like no,” answered Caleb, with the same impenetrable gravity.\n\n“Hark ye, Caleb,” said his master, “this grows a little too much for\nmy patience. I must go and examine how matters stand at Wolf's Crag\nmyself.”\n\n“Your honour is ganging to gang nae sic gate,” said Caleb, firmly.\n\n“And why not?” said Ravenswood, sharply; “who or what shall prevent me?”\n\n“Even I mysell,” said Caleb, with the same determination.\n\n“You, Balderstone!” replied the Master; “you are forgetting yourself, I\nthink.”\n\n“But I think no,” said Balderstone; “for I can just tell ye a' about the\ncastle on this knowe-head as weel as if ye were at it. Only dinna pit\nyoursell into a kippage, and expose yoursell before the weans, or before\nthe Marquis, when ye gang down-bye.”\n\n“Speak out, you old fool,” replied his master, “and let me know the best\nand the worst at once.”\n\n“Ou, the best and the warst is, just that the tower is standing hail and\nfeir, as safe and as empty as when ye left it.”\n\n“Indeed! and the fire?” said Ravenswood. “Not a gleed of fire, then,\nexcept the bit kindling peat, and maybe a spunk in Mysie's cutty-pipe,”\n replied Caleb.\n\n“But the flame?” demanded Ravenswood--“the broad blaze which might have\nbeen seen ten miles off--what occasioned that?”\n\n“Hout awa'! it's an auld saying and a true--\n\n     Little's the light Will be seen far in a mirk night.\n\nA wheen fern and horse little that I fired in the courtyard, after\nsending back the loon of a footman; and, to speak Heaven's truth, the\nnext time that ye send or bring ony body here, let them ge gentles\nallenarly, without ony fremd servants, like that chield Lockhard, to\nbe gledging and gleeing about, and looking upon the wrang side of ane's\nhousekeeping, to the discredit of the family, and forcing ane to damn\ntheir souls wi' telling ae lee after another faster than I can count\nthem: I wad rather set fire to the tower in gude earnest, and burn it\nower my ain head into the bargain, or I see the family dishonoured in\nthe sort.”\n\n“Upon my word, I am infinitely obliged by the proposal, Caleb,” said his\nmaster, scarce able to restrain his laughter, though rather angry at\nthe same time. “But the gunpowder--is there such a thing in the tower?\nThe Marquis seemed to know of it.” “The pouther, ha! ha! ha!--the\nMarquis, ha! ha! ha!” replied Caleb,--“if your honour were to brain me,\nI behooved to laugh,--the Marquis--the pouther! Was it there? Ay, it was\nthere. Did he ken o't? My certie! the Marquis kenn'd o't, and it was the\nbest o' the game; for, when I couldna pacify your honour wi' a' that I\ncould say, I aye threw out a word mair about the gunpouther, and garr'd\nthe Marquis tak the job in his ain hand.”\n\n“But you have not answered my question,” said the Master, impatiently;\n“how came the powder there, and where is it now?”\n\n“Ou, it came there, an ye maun needs ken,” said Caleb, looking\nmysteriously, and whispering, “when there was like to be a wee bit\nrising here; and the Marquis, and a' the great lords of the north, were\na' in it, and mony a gudely gun and broadsword were ferried ower frae\nDunkirk forbye the pouther. Awfu' work we had getting them into the\ntower under cloud o' night, for ye maun think it wasna everybody could\nbe trusted wi' sic kittle jobs. But if ye will gae hame to your supper,\nI will tell you a' about it as ye gang down.”\n\n“And these wretched boys,” said Ravenswood, “is it your pleasure they\nare to sit there all night, to wait for the blowing up of a tower that\nis not even on fire?”\n\n“Surely not, if it is your honour's pleasure that they suld gang hame;\nalthough,” added Caleb, “it wadna do them a grain's damage: they wad\nscreigh less the next day, and sleep the sounder at e'en. But just as\nyour honour likes.”\n\nStepping accordingly towards the urchins who manned the knolls near\nwhich they stood, Caleb informed them, in an authoritative tone, that\ntheir honours Lord Ravenswood and the Marquis of A---- had given orders\nthat the tower was not to be blow up till next day at noon. The boys\ndispersed upon this comfortable assurance. One or two, however, followed\nCaleb for more information, particularly the urchin whom he had cheated\nwhile officiating as turnspit, who screamed, “Mr. Balderstone!--Mr.\nBalderstone! then the castle's gane out like an auld wife's spunk?”\n\n“To be sure it is, callant,” said the butler; “do ye think the castle\nof as great a lord as Lord Ravenswood wad continue in a bleeze, and him\nstanding looking on wi' his ain very een? It's aye right,” continued\nCaleb, shaking off his ragged page, and closing in to his Master, “to\ntrain up weans, as the wise man says, in the way they should go, and,\naboon a', to teach them respect to their superiors.”\n\n“But all this while, Caleb, you have never told me what became of the\narms and powder,” said Ravenswood.\n\n“Why, as for the arms,” said Caleb, “it was just like the bairn's\nrhyme--\n\n     Some gaed east and some gaed west,\n     And some gaed to the craw's nest.\n\nAnd for the pouther, I e'en changed it, as occasion served, with the\nskippers o' Dutch luggers and French vessels, for gin and brandy, and is\nserved the house mony a year--a gude swap too, between what cheereth the\nsoul of man and that which hingeth it clean out of his body; forbye,\nI keepit a wheen pounds of it for yoursell when ye wanted to take the\npleasure o' shooting: whiles, in these latter days, I wad hardly hae\nkenn'd else whar to get pouther for your pleasure. And now that your\nanger is ower, sir, wasna that weel managed o' me, and arena ye far\nbetter sorted doun yonder than ye could hae been in your ain auld ruins\nup-bye yonder, as the case stands wi' us now? the mair's the pity!”\n\n“I believe you may be right, Caleb; but, before burning down my castle,\neither in jest or in earnest,” said Ravenswood, “I think I had a right\nto be in the secret.”\n\n“Fie for shame, your honour!” replied Caleb; “it fits an auld carle like\nme weel eneugh to tell lees for the credit of the family, but it wadna\nbeseem the like o' your honour's sell; besides, young folk are no\njudicious: they cannot make the maist of a bit figment. Now this\nfire--for a fire it sall be, if I suld burn the auld stable to make it\nmair feasible--this fire, besides that it will be an excuse for asking\nony thing we want through the country, or doun at the haven--this\nfire will settle mony things on an honourable footing for the family's\ncredit, that cost me telling twenty daily lees to a wheen idle chaps\nand queans, and, what's waur, without gaining credence.” “That was hard\nindeed, Caleb; but I do not see how this fire should help your veracity\nor your credit.”\n\n“There it is now?” said Caleb; “wasna I saying that young folk had a\ngreen judgment? How suld it help me, quotha? It will be a creditable\napology for the honour of the family for this score of years to come, if\nit is weel guided. 'Where's the family pictures?' says ae meddling body.\n'The great fire at Wolf's Crag,' answers I. 'Where's the family plate?'\nsays another. 'The great fire,' says I; 'wha was to think of plate,\nwhen life and limb were in danger?' 'Where's the wardrobe and the\nlinens?--where's the tapestries and the decorements?--beds of state,\ntwilts, pands and testors, napery and broidered wark?' 'The fire--the\nfire--the fire.' Guide the fire weel, and it will serve ye for a' that\nye suld have and have not; and, in some sort, a gude excuse is better\nthan the things themselves; for they maun crack and wear out, and be\nconsumed by time, whereas a gude offcome, prudently and creditably\nhandled, may serve a nobleman and his family, Lord kens how lang!”\n\nRavenswood was too well acquainted with his butler's pertinacity and\nself-opinion to dispute the point with him any farther. Leaving Caleb,\ntherefore, to the enjoyment of his own successful ingenuity, he returned\nto the hamlet, where he found the Marquis and the good women of the\nmansion under some anxiety--the former on account of his absence, the\nothers for the discredit their cookery might sustain by the delay of the\nsupper. All were now at ease, and heard with pleasure that the fire at\nthe castle had burned out of itself without reaching the vaults, which\nwas the only information that Ravenswood thought it proper to give in\npublic concerning the event of his butler's strategem.\n\nThey sat down to an excellent supper. No invitation could prevail on\nMr. and Mrs. Girder, even in their own house, to sit down at table with\nguests of such high quality. They remained standing in the apartment,\nand acted the part of respectful and careful attendants on the company.\nSuch were the manners of the time. The elder dame, confident through\nher age and connexion with the Ravenswood family, was less scrupulously\nceremonious. She played a mixed part betwixt that of the hostess of an\ninn and the mistress of a private house, who receives guests above her\nown degree. She recommended, and even pressed, what she thought best,\nand was herself easily entreated to take a moderate share of the good\ncheer, in order to encourage her guests by her own example. Often she\ninterrupted herself, to express her regret that “my lord did not eat;\nthat the Master was pyking a bare bane; that, to be sure, there was\nnaething there fit to set before their honours; that Lord Allan, rest\nhis saul, used to like a pouthered guse, and said it was Latin for a\ntass o' brandy; that the brandy came frae France direct; for, for a' the\nEnglish laws and gaugers, the Wolf's Hope brigs hadna forgotten the gate\nto Dunkirk.”\n\nHere the cooper admonished his mother-in-law with his elbow, which\nprocured him the following special notice in the progress of her speech:\n\n“Ye needna be dunshin that gate, John [Gibbie],” continued the old lady;\n“naebody says that YE ken whar the brandy comes frae; and it wadna be\nfitting ye should, and you the Queen's cooper; and what signifies't,”\n continued she, addressing Lord Ravenswood, “to king, queen, or kaiser\nwhar an auld wife like me buys her pickle sneeshin, or her drap\nbrandy-wine, to haud her heart up?”\n\nHaving thus extricated herself from her supposed false step, Dame\nLoup-the-Dyke proceeded, during the rest of the evening, to supply, with\ngreat animation, and very little assistance from her guests, the funds\nnecessary for the support of the conversation, until, declining any\nfurther circulation of their glass, her guests requested her permission\nto retire to their apartments.\n\nThe Marquis occupied the chamber of dais, which, in every house above\nthe rank of a mere cottage, was kept sacred for such high occasions as\nthe present. The modern finishing with plaster was then unknown, and\ntapestry was confined to the houses of the nobility and superior gentry.\nThe cooper, therefore, who was a man of some vanity, as well as some\nwealth, had imitated the fashion observed by the inferior landholders\nand clergy, who usually ornamented their state apartments with hangings\nof a sort of stamped leather, manufactured in the Netherlands, garnished\nwith trees and animals executed in copper foil, and with many a pithy\nsentence of morality, which, although couched in Low Dutch, were perhaps\nas much attended to in practice as if written in broad Scotch. The\nwhole had somewhat of a gloomy aspect; but the fire, composed of\nold pitch-barrel staves, blazed merrily up the chimney; the bed was\ndecorated with linen of most fresh and dazzling whiteness, which had\nnever before been used, and might, perhaps, have never been used at\nall, but for this high occasion. On the toilette beside, stood an\nold-fashioned mirror, in a fillagree frame, part of the dispersed finery\nof the neighbouring castle. It was flanked by a long-necked bottle of\nFlorence wine, by which stood a glass nearly as tall, resembling\nin shape that which Teniers usually places in the hands of his own\nportrait, when he paints himself as mingling in the revels of a country\nvillage. To counterbalance those foreign sentinels, there mounted guard\non the other side of the mirror two stout warders of Scottish lineage;\na jug, namely, of double ale, which held a Scotch pint, and a quaigh,\nor bicker, of ivory and ebony, hooped with silver, the work of\nJohn Girder's own hands, and the pride of his heart. Besides these\npreparations against thirst, there was a goodly diet-loaf, or sweet\ncake; so that, with such auxiliaries, the apartment seemed victualled\nagainst a siege of two or three days.\n\nIt only remains to say, that the Marquis's valet was in attendance,\ndisplaying his master's brocaded nightgown, and richly embroidered\nvelvet cap, lined and faced with Brussels lace, upon a huge leathern\neasy-chair, wheeled round so as to have the full advantage of the\ncomfortable fire which we have already mentioned. We therefore commit\nthat eminent person to his night's repose, trusting he profited by the\nample preparations made for his accommodation--preparations which we\nhave mentioned in detail, as illustrative of ancient Scottish manners.\n\nIt is not necessary we should be equally minute in describing the\nsleeping apartment of the Master of Ravenswood, which was that usually\noccupied by the goodman and goodwife themselves. It was comfortably\nhung with a sort of warm-coloured worsted, manufactured in Scotland,\napproaching in trexture to what is now called shalloon. A staring\npicture of John [Gibbie] Girder himself ornamented this dormiory,\npainted by a starving Frenchman, who had, God knows how or why, strolled\nover from Flushing or Dunkirk to Wolf's Hope in a smuggling dogger. The\nfeatures were, indeed, those of the stubborn, opinionative, yet sensible\nartisan, but Monsieur had contrived to throw a French grace into the\nlook and manner, so utterly inconsistent with the dogged gravity of the\noriginal, that it was impossible to look at it without laughing. John\nand his family, however, piqued themselves not a little upon this\npicture, and were proportionably censured by the neighbourhood, who\npronounced that the cooper, in sitting for the same, and yet more in\npresuming to hang it up in his bedchamber, had exceeded his privilege as\nthe richest man of the village; at once stept beyond the bounds of his\nown rank, and encroached upon those of the superior orders; and,\nin fine, had been guilty of a very overweening act of vanity and\npresumption. Respect for the memory of my deceased friend, Mr. Richard\nTinto, has obliged me to treat this matter at some length; but I spare\nthe reader his prolix though curious observations, as well upon the\ncharacter of the French school as upon the state of painting in Scotland\nat the beginning of the 18th century.\n\nThe other preparations of the Master's sleeping apartment were similar\nto those in the chamber of dais.\n\nAt the usual early hour of that period, the Marquis of A---- and his\nkinsman prepared to resume their journey. This could not be done\nwithout an ample breakfast, in which cold meat and hot meat, and oatmeal\nflummery, wine and spirits, and milk varied by every possible mode of\npreparation, evinced the same desire to do honour to their guests which\nhad been shown by the hospitable owners of the mansion upon the evening\nbefore. All the bustle of preparation for departure now resounded\nthrough Wolf's Hope. There was paying of bills and shaking of hands,\nand saddling of horses, and harnessing of carriages, and distributing\nof drink-money. The Marquis left a broad piece for the gratification\nof John Girder's household, which he, the said John, was for some time\ndisposed to convert to his own use; Dingwall, the writer, assuring\nhim he was justified in so doing, seeing he was the disburser of\nthose expenses which were the occasion of the gratification. But,\nnotwithstanding this legal authority, John could not find in his heart\nto dim the splendour of his late hospitality by picketing anything in\nthe nature of a gratuity. He only assured his menials he would consider\nthem as a damned ungrateful pack if they bought a gill of brandy\nelsewhere than out of his own stores; and as the drink-money was likely\nto go to its legitimate use, he comforted himself that, in this manner,\nthe Marquis's donative would, without any impeachment of credit and\ncharacter, come ultimately into his own exclusive possession.\n\nWhile arrangements were making for departure, Ravenswood made blythe the\nheart of his ancient butler by informing him, cautiously however (for\nhe knew Caleb's warmth of imagination), of the probable change which was\nabout to take place in his fortunes. He deposited with Balderstone, at\nthe same time, the greater part of his slender funds, with an assurance,\nwhich he was obliged to reiterate more than once, that he himself had\nsufficient supplies in certain prospect. He therefore enjoined Caleb, as\nhe valued his favour, to desist from all farther maneouvres against the\ninhabitants of Wolf's Hope, their cellars, poultry-yards, and substance\nwhatsoever. In this prohibition, the old domestic acquiesced more\nreadily than his master expected.\n\n“It was doubtless,” he said, “a shame, a discredit, and a sin to harry\nthe puir creatures, when the family were in circumstances to live\nhonourably on their ain means; and there might be wisdom,” he added, “in\ngiving them a while's breathing-time at any rate, that they might be the\nmore readily brought forward upon his honour's future occasions.”\n\nThis matter being settled, and having taken an affectionate farewell of\nhis old domestic, the Master rejoined his noble relative, who was now\nready to enter his carriage. The two landladies, old and young, having\nreceived in all kindly greeting a kiss from each of their noble guests,\nstood simpering at the door of their house, as the coach and six,\nfollowed by its train of clattering horsemen, thundered out of the\nvillage. John Girder also stood upon his threshold, now looking at his\nhonoured right hand, which had been so lately shaken by a marquis and\na lord, and now giving a glance into the interior of his mansion, which\nmanifested all the disarray of the late revel, as if balancing\nthe distinction which he had attained with the expenses of the\nentertainment.\n\nAt length he opened his oracular jaws. “Let every man and woman here set\nabout their ain business, as if there was nae sic thing as marquis or\nmaster, duke or drake, laird or lord, in this world. Let the house be\nredd up, the broken meat set bye, and if there is ony thing totally\nuneatable, let it be gien to the puir folk; and, gude mother and wife, I\nhae just ae thing to entreat ye, that ye will never speak to me a single\nword, good or bad, anent a' this nonsense wark, but keep a' your cracks\nabout it to yoursells and your kimmers, for my head is weel-nigh dung\ndonnart wi' it already.”\n\nAs John's authority was tolerably absolute, all departed to their usual\noccupations, leaving him to build castles in the air, if he had a mind,\nupon the court favour which he had acquired by the expenditure of his\nworldly substance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\n     Why, now I have Dame Fortune by the Forelock,\n     And if she escapes my grasp, the fault is mine;\n     He that hath buffeted with stern adversity\n     Best knows the shape his course to favouring breezes.\n\n     Old Play.\n\nOUR travellers reach Edinburgh without any farther adventure, and the\nMaster of Ravenswood, as had been previously settled, took up his abode\nwith his noble friend.\n\nIn the mean time, the political crisis which had been expected took\nplace, and the Tory party obtained in the Scottish, as in the English,\ncouncils of Queen Anne a short-lived ascendency, of which it is not our\nbusiness to trace either the cause or consequences. Suffice it to say,\nthat it affected the different political parties according to the nature\nof their principles. In England, many of the High Church party, with\nHarley, afterwards Earl of Oxford, at their head, affected to separate\ntheir principles from those of the Jacobites, and, on that account,\nobtained the denomination of Whimsicals. The Scottish High Church party,\non the contrary, or, as they termed themselves, the Cavaliers, were more\nconsistent, if not so prudent, in their politics, and viewed all the\nchanges now made as preparatory to calling to the throne, upon the\nqueen's demise, her brother the Chevalier de St. George. Those who had\nsuffered in his service now entertained the most unreasonable hopes,\nnot only of indemnification, but of vengeance upon their political\nadversaries; while families attached to the Whig interest saw nothing\nbefore them but a renewal of the hardships they had undergone during the\nreigns of Charles the Second and his brother, and a retaliation of the\nconfiscation which had been inflicted upon the Jacobites during that of\nKing William.\n\nBut the most alarmed at the change of system was that prudential set of\npersons, some of whom are found in all governments, but who abound in a\nprovincial administration like that of Scotland during the period,\nand who are what Cromwell called waiters upon Providence, or, in other\nwords, uniform adherents to the party who are uppermost. Many of these\nhastened to read their recantation to the Marquis of A----; and, as\nit was easily seen that he took a deep interest in the affairs of\nhis kinsman, the Master of Ravenswood, they were the first to suggest\nmeasures for retrieving at least a part of his property, and for\nrestoring him in blood against his father's attainder.\n\nOld Lord Turntippet professed to be one of the most anxious for the\nsuccess of these measures; for “it grieved him to the very saul,” he\nsaid, “to see so brave a young gentleman, of sic auld and undoubted\nnobility, and, what was mair than a' that, a bluid relation of the\nMarquis of A----, the man whom,” he swore, “he honoured most upon\nthe face of the earth, brougth to so severe a pass. For his ain\npuir peculiar,” as he said, “and to contribute something to the\nrehabilitation of sae auld ane house,” the said Turntippet sent in three\nfamily pictures lacking the frames, and six high-backed chairs, with\nworked Turkey cushions, having the crest of Ravenswood broidered\nthereon, without charging a penny either of the principal or interest\nthey had cost him, when he bought them, sixteen years before, at a roup\nof the furniture of Lord Ravenswood's lodgings in the Canongate.\n\nMuch more to Lord Turntippet's dismay than to his surprise, although\nhe affected to feel more of the latter than the former, the Marquis\nreceived his gift very drily, and observed, that his lordship's\nrestitution, if he expected it to be received by the Master of\nRavenswood and his friends, must comprehend a pretty large farm, which,\nhaving been mortgaged to Turntippet for a very inadequate sum, he had\ncontrived, during the confusion of the family affairs, and by means\nwell understood by the lawyers of that period, to acquire to himself in\nabsolute property.\n\nThe old time-serving lord winced excessively under the requisition,\nprotesting to God, that he saw no occasion the lad could have for the\ninstant possession of the land, seeing he would doubtless now recover\nthe bulk of his estate from Sir William Ashton, to which he was ready to\ncontribute by every means in his power, as was just and reasonable; and\nfinally declaring, that he was willing to settle the land on the young\ngentleman after his own natural demise.\n\nBut all these excuses availed nothing, and he was compelled to disgorge\nthe property, on receiving back the sum for which it had been mortgaged.\nHaving no other means of making peace with the higher powers, he\nreturned home sorrowful and malcontent, complaining to his confidants,\n“That every mutation or change in the state had hitherto been productive\nof some sma' advantage to him in his ain quiet affairs; but that the\npresent had--pize upon it!--cost him one of the best penfeathers o' his\nwing.”\n\nSimilar measures were threatened against others who had profited by\nthe wreck of the fortune of Ravenswood; and Sir William Ashton, in\nparticular, was menaced with an appeal to the House of Peers, a court\nof equity, against the judicial sentences, proceeding upon a strict and\nsevere construction of the letter of the law, under which he held the\ncastle and barony of Ravenswood. With him, however, the Master, as well\nfor Lucy's sake as on account of the hospitality he had received from\nhim, felt himself under the necessity of proceeding with great candor.\nHe wrote to the late Lord Keeper, for he no longer held that office,\nstating frankly the engagement which existed between him and Miss\nAshton, requesting his permission for their union, and assuring him of\nhis willingness to put the settlement of all matters between them upon\nsuch a footing as Sir William himself should think favourable.\n\nThe same messenger was charged with a letter to Lady Ashton, deprecating\nany cause of displeasure which the Master might unintentionally have\ngiven her, enlarging upon his attachment to Miss Ashton, and the length\nto which it had proceeded, and conjuring the lady, as a Douglas in\nnature as well as in name, generously to forget ancient prejudices and\nmisunderstandings, and to believe that the family had acquired a friend,\nand she herself a respectful and attached humble servant, in him who\nsubscribed himself, “Edgar, Master of Ravenswood.” A third letter\nRavenswood addressed to Lucy, and the messenger was instructed to find\nsome secret and secure means of delivering it into her own hands. It\ncontained the strongest protestations of continued affection, and\ndwelt upon the approaching change of the writer's fortunes, as chiefly\nvaluable by tending to remove the impediments to their union. He related\nthe steps he had taken to overcome the prejudices of her parents,\nand especially of her mother, and expressed his hope they might prove\neffectual. If not, he still trusted that his absence from Scotland upon\nan important and honourable mission might give time for prejudices to\ndie away; while he hoped and trusted Miss Ashton's constancy, on which\nhe had the most implicit reliance, would baffle any effort that might\nbe used to divert her attachment. Much more there was, which, however\ninteresting to the lovers themselves, would afford the reader neither\ninterest nor information. To each of these three letters the Master of\nRavenswood received an answer, but by different means of conveyance, and\ncertainly couched in very different styles.\n\nLady Ashton answered his letter by his own messenger, who was not\nallowed to remain at Ravenswood a moment longer than she was engaged\nin penning these lines.\n\n“For the hand of Mr. Ravenswood of Wolf's Crag--These:\n\n“SIR, UNKNOWN:\n\n“I have received a letter, signed 'Edgar, Master of Ravenswood,'\nconcerning the writer whereof I am uncertain, seeing that the honours of\nsuch a family were forfeited for high treason in the person of Allan,\nlate Lord Ravenswood. Sir, if you shall happen to be the person so\nsubscribing yourself, you will please to know, that I claim the full\ninterest of a parent in Miss Lucy Ashton, which I have disposed of\nirrevocably in behalf of a worthy person. And, sir, were this otherwise,\nI would not listen to a proposal from you, or any of your house, seeing\ntheir hand has been uniformly held up against the freedom of the subject\nand the immunities of God's kirk. Sir, it is not a flightering blink of\nprosperity which can change my constant opinion in this regard, seeing\nit has been my lot before now, like holy David, to see the wicked great\nin power and flourishing like a green bay-tree; nevertheless I passed,\nand they were not, and the place thereof knew them no more. Wishing you\nto lay these things to your heart for your own sake, so far as they may\nconcern you, I pray you to take no farther notice of her who desires to\nremain your unknown servant,\n\n“MARGARET DOUGLAS,\n\n“otherwise ASHTON.”\n\n\nAbout two days after he had received this very unsatisfactory epistle,\nthe Master of Ravenswood, while walking up the High Street of Edinburgh,\nwas jostled by a person, in whom, as the man pulled off his hat to make\nan apology, he recognized Lockhard, the confidential domestic of\nSir William Ashton. The man bowed, slipt a letter into his hand, and\ndisappeared. The packet contained four close-written folios, from which,\nhowever, as is sometimes incident to the compositions of great lawyers,\nlittle could be extracted, excepting that the writer felt himself in a\nvery puzzling predicament.\n\nSir William spoke at length of his high value and regard for his dear\nyoung friend, the Master of Ravenswood, and of his very extreme high\nvalue and regard for the Marquis of A----, his very dear old friend;\nhe trusted that any measures that they might adopt, in which he was\nconcerned, would be carred on with due regard to the sanctity of\ndecreets and judgments obtained in foro contentioso; protesting, before\nmen and angels, that if the law of Scotland, as declared in her supreme\ncourts, were to undergo a reversal in the English House of Lords, the\nevils which would thence arise to the public would inflict a greater\nwound upon his heart than any loss he might himself sustain by such\nirregular proceedings. He flourished much on generosity and forgiveness\nof mutual injuries, and hinted at the mutability of human affairs,\nalways favourite topics with the weaker party in politics. He\npathetically lamented, and gently censured, the haste which had been\nused in depriving him of his situation of Lord Keeper, which his\nexperience had enabled him to fill with some advantage to the public,\nwithout so much as giving him an opportunity of explaining how far his\nown views of general politics might essentially differ from those now in\npower. He was convinced the Marquis of A---- had as sincere intentions\ntowards the public as himself or any man; and if, upon a conference,\nthey could have agreed upon the measures by which it was to be pursued,\nhis experience and his interest should have gone to support the present\nadministration. Upon the engagement betwixt Ravenswood and his daughter,\nhe spoke in a dry and confused manner. He regretted so premature a\nstep as the engagement of the young people should have been taken, and\nconjured the Master to remember he had never given any encouragement\nthereunto; and observed that, as a transaction inter minores, and\nwithout concurrence of his daughter's natural curators, the engagement\nwas inept, and void in law. This precipitate measure, he added, had\nproduced a very bad effect upon Lady Ashton's mind, which it was\nimpossible at present to remove. Her son, Colonel Douglas Ashton, had\nembraced her prejudices in the fullest extent, and it was impossible for\nSir William to adopt a course disagreeable to them without a fatal and\nirreconcilable breach in his family; which was not at present to be\nthought of. Time, the great physician, he hoped, would mend all.\n\nIn a postscript, Sir William said something more explicitly, which\nseemed to intimate that, rather than the law of Scotland should sustain\na severe wound through his sides, by a reversal of the judgment of her\nsupreme courts, in the case of the barony of Ravenswood, through the\nintervention of what, with all submission, he must term a foreign court\nof appeal, he himself would extrajudically consent to considerable\nsacrifices.\n\nFrom Lucy Ashton, by some unknown conveyance, the Master received the\nfollowing lines: “I received yours, but it was at the utmost risk; do\nnot attempt to write again till better times. I am sore beset, but I\nwill be true to my word, while the exercise of my reason is vouchsafed\nto me. That you are happy and prosperous is some consolation, and my\nsituation requires it all.” The note was signed “L.A.”\n\nThis letter filled Ravenswood with the most lively alarm. He made many\nattempts, notwithstanding her prohibition, to convey letters to Miss\nAshton, and even to obtain an interview; but his plans were frustrated,\nand he had only the mortification to learn that anxious and effectual\nprecautions had been taken to prevent the possibility of their\ncorrespondence. The Master was the more distressed by these\ncircumstances, as it became impossible to delay his departure from\nScotland, upon the important mission which had been confided to him.\nBefore his departure, he put Sir William Ashton's letter into the hands\nof the Marquis of A----, who observed with a smile, that Sir William's\nday of grace was past, and that he had now to learn which side of the\nhedge the sun had got to. It was with the greatest difficulty that\nRavenswood extorted from the Marquis a promise that he would compromise\nthe proceedings in Parliament, providing Sir William should be disposed\nto acquiesce in a union between him and Lucy Ashton.\n\n“I would hardly,” said the Marquis, “consent to your throwing away your\nbirthright in this manner, were I not perfectly confident that Lady\nAshton, or Lady Douglas, or whatever she calls herself, will, as\nScotchmen say, keep her threep; and that her husband dares not\ncontradict her.”\n\n“But yet,” said the Master, “I trust your lordship will consider my\nengagement as sacred.”\n\n“Believe my word of honour,” said the Marquis, “I would be a friend even\nto your follies; and having thus told you MY opinion, I will endeavour,\nas occasion offers, to serve you according to your own.”\n\nThe master of Ravenswood could but thank his generous kinsman and\npatron, and leave him full power to act in all his affairs. He departed\nfrom Scotland upon his mission, which, it was supposed, might detain him\nupon the continent for some months.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\n     Was ever woman in this humor wooed?\n     Was ever woman in this humour won?\n     I'll have her.\n\n     Richard III.\n\nTWELVE months had passed away since the Master of Ravenswood's departure\nfor the continent, and, although his return to Scotland had been\nexpected in a much shorter space, yet the affairs of his mission,\nor, according to a prevailing report, others of a nature personal to\nhimself, still detained him abroad. In the mean time, the altered state\nof affairs in Sir William Ashton's family may be gathered from the\nfollowing conversation which took place betwixt Bucklaw and his\nconfidential bottle companion and dependant, the noted Captain\nCraigengelt. They were seated on either side of the huge\nsepulchral-looking freestone chimney in the low hall at Girnington.\nA wood fire blazed merrily in the grate; a round oaken table, placed\nbetween them, supported a stoup of excellent claret, two rummer glasses,\nand other good cheer; and yet, with all these appliances and means\nto boot, the countenance of the patron was dubious, doubtful, and\nunsatisfied, while the invention of his dependant was taxed to the\nutmost to parry what he most dreaded, a fit, as he called it, of\nthe sullens, on the part of his protector. After a long pause, only\ninterrupted by the devil's tattoo, which Bucklaw kept beating against\nthe hearth with the toe of his boot, Craigengelt at last ventured to\nbreak silence. “May I be double distanced,” said he, “if ever I saw a\nman in my life have less the air of a bridegroom! Cut me out of feather,\nif you have not more the look of a man condemned to be hanged!”\n\n“My kind thanks for the compliment,” replied Bucklaw; “but I suppose you\nthink upon the predicament in which you yourself are most likely to be\nplaced; and pray, Captain Craigengelt, if it please your worship, why\nshould I look merry, when I'm sad, and devilish sad too?”\n\n“And that's what vexes me,” said Craigengelt. “Here is this match, the\nbest in the whole country, and which were so anxious about, is on the\npoint of being concluded, and you are as sulky as a bear that has lost\nits whelps.”\n\n“I do not know,” answered the Laird, doggedly, “whether I should\nconclude or not, if it was not that I am too far forwards to leap back.”\n\n“Leap back!” exclaimed Craigengelt, with a well-assumed air of\nastonishment, “that would be playing the back-game with a witness! Leap\nback! Why, is not the girl's fortune----”\n\n“The young lady's, if you please,” said Hayston, interrupting him.\n\n“Well--well, no disrespect meant. Will Miss Ashton's tocher not weigh\nagainst any in Lothian?”\n\n“Granted,” answered Bucklaw; “but I care not a penny for her tocher; I\nhave enough of my own.”\n\n“And the mother, that loves you like her own child?”\n\n“Better than some of her children, I believe,” said Bucklaw, “or there\nwould be little love wared on the matter.”\n\n“And Colonel Sholto Douglas Ashton, who desires the marriage above all\nearthly things?”\n\n“Because,” said Bucklaw, “he expects to carry the county of ---- through\nmy interest.”\n\n“And the father, who is as keen to see the match concluded as ever I\nhave been to win a main?”\n\n“Ay,” said Bucklaw, in the same disparaging manner, “it lies with Sir\nWilliam's policy to secure the next best match, since he cannot barter\nhis child to save the great Ravenswood estate, which the English House\nof Lords are about to wrench out of his clutches.”\n\n“What say you to the young lady herself?” said Craigengelt; “the finest\nyoung woman in all Scotland, one that you used to be so fond of when she\nwas cross, and now she consents to have you, and gives up her engagement\nwith Ravenswood, you are for jibbing. I must say, the devil's in ye,\nwhen ye neither know what you would have nor what you would want.”\n\n“I'll tell you my meaning in a word,” answered Bucklaw, getting up and\nwalking through the room; “I want to know what the devil is the cause of\nMiss Ashton's changing her mind so suddenly?”\n\n“And what need you care,” said Craigengelt, “since the change is in your\nfavour?”\n\n“I'll tell you what it is,” returned his patron, “I never knew much of\nthat sort of fine ladies, and I believe they may be as capricious as the\ndevil; but there is something in Miss Ashton's change a devilish deal\ntoo sudden and too serious for a mere flisk of her own. I'll be bound,\nLady Ashton understands every machine for breaking in the human\nmind, and there are as many as there are cannon-bit, martingales, and\ncavessons for young colts.”\n\n“And if that were not the case,” said Craigengelt, “how the devil should\nwe ever get them into training at all?”\n\n“And that's true too,” said Bucklaw, suspending his march through the\ndining-room, and leaning upon the back of a chair. “And besides,\nhere's Ravenswood in the way still, do you think he'll give up Lucy's\nengagement?”\n\n“To be sure he will,” answered Craigengelt; “what good can it do him to\nrefuse, since he wishes to marry another woman and she another man?”\n\n“And you believe seriously,” said Bucklaw, “that he is going to marry\nthe foreign lady we heard of?”\n\n“You heard yourself,” answered Craigengelt, “what Captain Westenho said\nabout it, and the great preparation made for their blythesome bridal.”\n\n“Captain Westenho,” replied Bucklaw, “has rather too much of your own\ncast about, Craigie, to make what Sir William would call a 'famous\nwitness.' He drinks deep, plays deep, swears deep, and I suspect can lie\nand cheat a little into the bargain; useful qualities, Craigie, if\nkept in their proper sphere, but which have a little too much of the\nfreebooter to make a figure in a court of evidence.”\n\n“Well, then,” said Craigengelt, “will you believe Colonel Douglas\nAshton, who heard the Marquis of A---- say in a public circle, but not\naware that he was within ear-shot, that his kinsman had made a\nbetter arrangement for himself than to give his father's land for the\npale-cheeked daughter of a broken-down fanatic, and that Bucklaw was\nwelcome to the wearing of Ravenswood's shaughled shoes.”\n\n“Did he say so, by heavens!” cried Bucklaw, breaking out into one of\nthose incontrollable fits of passion to which he was constitutionally\nsubject; “if I had heard him, I would have torn the tongue out of his\nthroat before all his peats and minions, and Highland bullies into the\nbargain. Why did not Ashton run him through the body?”\n\n“Capot me if I know,” said the Captain. “He deserved it sure enough; but\nhe is an old man, and a minister of state, and there would be more risk\nthan credit in meddling with him. You had more need to think of making\nup to Miss Lucy Ashton the disgrace that's like to fall upon her than of\ninterfering with a man too old to fight, and on too high a tool for your\nhand to reach him.”\n\n“It SHALL reach him, though, one day,” said Bucklaw, “and his kinsman\nRavenswood to boot. In the mean time, I'll take care Miss Ashton\nreceives no discredit for the slight they have put upon her. It's an\nawkward job, however, and I wish it were ended; I scarce know how to\ntalk to her,--but fill a bumper, Craigie, and we'll drink her health.\nIt grows late, and a night-cowl of good claret is worth all the\nconsidering-caps in Europe.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\n     It was the copy of our conference.\n     In bed she slept not, for my urging it;\n     At board she fed not, for my urging it;\n     Alone, it was the subject of my theme;\n     In company I often glanced at it.\n\n     Comedy of Errors.\n\nTHE next morning saw Bucklaw and his faithful Achates, Craigengelt, at\nRavenswood Castle. They were most courteously received by the knight\nand his lady, as well, as by their son and heir, Colonel Ashton. After\na good deal of stammering and blushing--for Bucklaw, notwithstanding his\naudacity in other matters, had all the sheepish bashfulness common to\nthose who have lived little in respectable society--he contrived at\nlength to explain his wish to be admitted to a conference with Miss\nAshton upon the subject of their approaching union. Sir William and\nhis son looked at Lady Ashton, who replied with the greatest composure,\n“That Lucy would wait upon Mr. Hayston directly. I hope,” she added with\na smile, “that as Lucy is very young, and has been lately trepanned into\nan engagement of which she is now heartily ashamed, our dear Bucklaw\nwill excuse her wish that I should be present at their interview?”\n\n“In truth, my dear lady,” said Bucklaw, “it is the very thing that\nI would have desired on my own account; for I have been so little\naccustomed to what is called gallantry, that I shall certainly fall into\nsome cursed mistake unless I have the advantage of your ladyship as an\ninterpreter.”\n\nIt was thus that Bucklaw, in the perturbation of his embarrassment upon\nthis critical occasion, forgot the just apprehensions he had entertained\nof Lady Ashton's overbearing ascendency over her daughter's mind, and\nlost an opportunity of ascertaining, by his own investigation, the real\nstate of Lucy's feelings.\n\nThe other gentlemen left the room, and in a short time Lady Ashton,\nfollowed by her daughter, entered the apartment. She appeared, as he had\nseen her on former occasions, rather composed than agitated; but a nicer\njudge than he could scarce have determined whether her calmness was that\nof despair or of indifference. Bucklaw was too much agitated by his own\nfeelings minutely to scrutinise those of the lady. He stammered out an\nunconnected address, confounding together the two or three topics to\nwhich it related, and stopt short before he brought it to any regular\nconclusion. Miss Ashton listened, or looked as if she listened, but\nreturned not a single word in answer, continuing to fix her eyes on\na small piece of embroidery on which, as if by instinct or habit, her\nfingers were busily employed. Lady Ashton sat at some distance, almost\nscreened from notice by the deep embrasure of the window in which she\nhad placed her chair. From this she whispered, in a tone of voice\nwhich, though soft and sweet, had something in it of admonition, if not\ncommand: “Lucy, my dear, remember--have you heard what Bucklaw has been\nsaying?”\n\nThe idea of her mother's presence seemed to have slipped from the\nunhappy girl's recollection. She started, dropped her needle, and\nrepeated hastily, and almost in the same breath, the contradictory\nanswers: “Yes, madam--no, my lady--I beg pardon, I did not hear.”\n\n“You need not blush, my love, and still less need you look so pale and\nfrightened,” said Lady Ashton, coming forward; “we know that maiden's\nears must be slow in receiving a gentleman's language; but you must\nremember Mr. Hayston speaks on a subject on which you have long since\nagreed to give him a favourable hearing. You know how much your father\nand I have our hearts set upon an event so extremely desirable.”\n\nIn Lady Ashton's voice, a tone of impressive, and even stern, innuendo\nwas sedulously and skilfully concealed under an appearance of the most\naffectionate maternal tenderness. The manner was for Bucklaw, who was\neasily enough imposed upon; the matter of the exhortation was for the\nterrified Lucy, who well knew how to interpret her mother's hints,\nhowever skilfully their real purport might be veiled from general\nobservation.\n\nMiss Ashton sat upright in her chair, cast round her a glance in which\nfear was mingled with a still wilder expression, but remained perfectly\nsilent. Bucklaw, who had in the mean time paced the room to and fro,\nuntil he had recovered his composure, now stopped within two or three\nyards of her chair, and broke out as follows: “I believe I have been a\nd--d fool, Miss Ashton; I have tried to speak to you as people tell me\nyoung ladies like to be talked to, and I don't think you comprehend\nwhat I have been saying; and no wonder, for d--n me if I understand it\nmyself! But, however, once for all, and in broad Scotch, your father and\nmother like what is proposed, and if you can take a plain young fellow\nfor your husband, who will never cross you in anything you have a mind\nto, I will place you at the head of the best establishment in the three\nLothians; you shall have Lady Girnington's lodging in the Canongate of\nEdinburgh, go where you please, do what you please, and see what you\nplease--and that's fair. Only I must have a corner at the board-end for\na worthless old playfellow of mine, whose company I would rather want\nthan have, if it were not that the d--d fellow has persuaded me that I\ncan't do without him; and so I hope you won't except against Craigie,\nalthough it might be easy to find much better company.”\n\n“Now, out upon you, Bucklaw,” said Lady Ashton, again interposing;\n“how can you think Lucy can have any objection to that blunt, honest,\ngood-natured creature, Captain Craigengelt?”\n\n“Why, madam,” replied Bucklaw, “as to Craigie's sincerity, honesty, and\ngood-nature, they are, I believe, pretty much upon a par; but that's\nneither here nor there--the fellow knows my ways, and has got useful to\nme, and I cannot well do without him, as I said before. But all this is\nnothing to the purpose; for since I have mustered up courage to make a\nplain proposal, I would fain hear Miss Ashton, from her own lips, give\nme a plain answer.”\n\n“My dear Bucklaw,” said Lady Ashton, “let me spare Lucy's bashfulness.\nI tell you, in her presence, that she has already consented to be guided\nby her father and me in this matter. Lucy, my love,” she added, with\nthat singular combination of suavity of tone and pointed energy which we\nhave already noticed--“Lucy, my dearest love! speak for yourself, is it\nnot as I say?”\n\nHer victim answered in a tremulous and hollow voice: “I HAVE promised to\nobey you--but upon one condition.”\n\n“She means,” said Lady Ashton, turning to Bucklaw, “she expects an\nanswer to the demand which she has made upon the man at Vienna, or\nRatisbon, or Paris--or where is he?--for restitution of the engagement\nin which he had the art to involve her. You will not, I am sure, my dear\nfriend, think it is wrong that she should feel much delicacy upon this\nhead; indeed, it concerns us all.”\n\n“Perfectly right--quite fair,” said Bucklaw, half humming, half speaking\nthe end of the old song--\n\n     “It is best to be off wi' the old love\n     Before you be on wi' the new.\n\nBut I thought,” said he, pausing, “you might have had an answer six\ntimes told from Ravenswood. D--n me, if I have not a mind to go fetch\none myself, if Miss Ashton will honour me with the commission.”\n\n“By no means,” said Lady Ashton; “we have had the utmost difficulty of\npreventing Douglas, for whom it would be more proper, from taking so\nrash a step; and do you think we could permit you, my good friend,\nalmost equally dear to us, to go to a desperate man upon an errand so\ndesperate? In fact, all the friends of the family are of opinion, and my\ndear Lucy herself ought so to think, that, as this unworthy person has\nreturned no answer to her letter, silence must on this, as in other\ncases, be held to give consent, and a contract must be supposed to be\ngiven up, when the party waives insisting upon it. Sir William, who\nshould know best, is clear upon this subject; and therefore, my dear\nLucy----”\n\n“Madam,” said Lucy, with unwonted energy, “urge me no farther; if this\nunhappy engagement be restored, I have already said you shall dispose\nof me as you will; till then I should commit a heavy sin in the sight\nof God and man in doing what you require.” “But, my love, if this man\nremains obstinately silent----”\n\n“He will NOT be silent,” answered Lucy; “it is six weeks since I sent\nhim a double of my former letter by a sure hand.”\n\n“You have not--you could not--you durst not,” said Lady Ashton, with\nviolence inconsistent with the tone she had intended to assume; but\ninstantly correcting herself, “My dearest Lucy,” said she, in her\nsweetest tone of expostulation, “how could you think of such a thing?”\n\n“No matter,” said Bucklaw; “I respect Miss Ashton for her sentiments,\nand I only wish I had been her messenger myself.”\n\n“And pray how long, Miss Ashton,” said her mother, ironically, “are\nwe to wait the return of your Pacolet--your fairy messenger--since our\nhumble couriers of flesh and blood could not be trusted in this matter?”\n\n“I have numbered weeks, days, hours, and minutes,” said Miss Ashton;\n“within another week I shall have an answer, unless he is dead. Till\nthat time, sir,” she said, addressing Bucklaw, “let me be thus far\nbeholden to you, that you will beg my mother to forbear me upon this\nsubject.”\n\n“I will make it my particular entreaty to Lady Ashton,” said Bucklaw.\n“By my honour, madam, I respect your feelings; and, although the\nprosecution of this affair be rendered dearer to me than ever, yet, as\nI am a gentleman, I would renounce it, were it so urged as to give you a\nmoment's pain.”\n\n“Mr. Hayston, I think, cannot comprehend that,” said Lady Ashton,\nlooking pale with anger, “when the daughter's happiness lies in the\nbosom of the mother. Let me ask you, Miss Ashton, in what terms your\nlast letter was couched?”\n\n“Exactly in the same, madam,” answered Lucy, “which you dictated on a\nformer occasion.”\n\n“When eight days have elapsed, then,” said her mother, resuming her tone\nof tenderness, “we shall hope, my dearest love, that you will end this\nsuspense.”\n\n“Miss Ashton must not be hurried, madam,” said Bucklaw, whose bluntness\nof feeling did not by any means arise from want of good-nature;\n“messengers may be stopped or delayed. I have known a day's journey\nbroke by the casting of a foreshoe. Stay, let me see my calendar: the\ntwentieth day from this is St. Jude's, and the day before I must be at\nCaverton Edge, to see the match between the Laird of Kittlegirth's black\nmare and Johnston the meal-monger's four-year-old-colt; but I can ride\nall night, or Craigie can bring me word how the match goes; and I hope,\nin the mean time, as I shall not myself distress Miss Ashton with any\nfurther importunity, that your ladyship yourself, and Sir William, and\nColonel Douglas will have the goodness to allow her uninterrupted time\nfor making up her mind.”\n\n“Sir,” said Miss Ashton, “you are generous.”\n\n“As for that, madam,” answered Bucklaw, “I only pretend to be a plain,\ngood-humoured young fellow, as I said before, who will willingly make you\nhappy if you will permit him, and show him how to do so.” Having said\nthis, he saluted her with more emotion than was consistent with\nhis usual train of feeling, and took his leave; Lady Ashton, as she\naccompanied him out of the apartment, assuring him that her daughter did\nfull justice to the sincerity of his attachment, and requesting him to\nsee Sir William before his departure, “since,” as she said, with a keen\nglance reverting towards Lucy, “against St. Jude's day, we must all be\nready to SIGN AND SEAL.”\n\n“To sign and seal!” echoed Lucy, in a muttering tone, as the door of the\napartment closed--“to sign and seal--to do and die!” and, clasping her\nextenuated hands together, she sunk back on the easy-chair she occupied,\nin a state resembling stupor.\n\nFrom this she was shortly after awakened by the boisterous entry of her\nbrother Henry, who clamorously reminded her of a promise to give him\ntwo yards of carnation ribbon to make knots to his new garters. With the\nmost patient composure Lucy arose, and opening a little ivory cabinet,\nsought out the ribbon the lad waned, measured it accurately, cut it off\ninto proper lengths, and knotted it into the fashion his boyish whim\nrequired.\n\n“Dinna shut the cabinet yet,” said Henry, “for I must have some of your\nsilver wire to fasten the bells to my hawk's jesses,--and yet the new\nfalcon's not worth them neither; for do you know, after all the plague\nwe had to get her from an eyrie, all the way at Posso, in Mannor Water,\nshe's going to prove, after all, nothing better than a rifler: she just\nwets her singles in the blood of the partridge, and then breaks away,\nand lets her fly; and what good can the poor bird do after that, you\nknow, except pine and die in the first heather-cow or whin-bush she can\ncrawl into?”\n\n“Right, Henry--right--very right,” said Luch, mournfully, holding the\nboy fast by the hand, after she had given him the wire he wanted; “but\nthere are more riflers in the world than your falcon, and more wounded\nbirds that seek but to die in quiet, that can find neither brake nor\nwhin-bush to hide their head in.”\n\n“Ah! that's some speech out of your romances,” said the boy; “and Sholto\nsays they have turned your head. But I hear Norman whistling to the\nhawk; I must go fasten on the jesses.”\n\nAnd he scampered away with the thoughtless gaiety of boyhood, leaving\nhis sister to the bitterness of her own reflections.\n\n“It is decreed,” she said, “that every living creature, even those who\nowe me most kindness, are to shun me, and leave me to those by whom I am\nbeset. It is just it should be thus. Alone and uncounselled, I involved\nmyself in these perils; alone and uncounselled, I must extricate myself\nor die.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\n     What doth ensue\n     But moody and dull melancholy,\n     Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,\n     And at her heel, a huge infectious troop\n     Of pale distemperatures, and foes to life?\n\n     Comedy of Errors.\n\nAS some vindication of the ease with which Bucklaw (who otherwise, as\nhe termed himself, was really a very good-humoured fellow) resigned his\njudgment to the management of Lady Ashton, while paying his addresses\nto her daughter, the reader must call to mind the strict domestic\ndiscipline which, at this period, was exercised over the females of a\nScottish family.\n\nThe manners of the country in this, as in many other respects, coincided\nwith those of France before the Revolution. Young women of the higher\nrank seldom mingled in society until after marriage, and, both in law\nand fact, were held to be under the strict tutelage of their parents,\nwho were too apt to enforce the views for their settlement in life\nwithout paying any regard to the inclination of the parties chiefly\ninterested. On such occasions, the suitor expected little more from his\nbride than a silent acquiescence in the will of her parents; and as few\nopportunities of acquaintance, far less of intimacy, occurred, he made\nhis choice by the outside, as the lovers in the Merchant of Venice\nselect the casket, contented to trust to chance the issue of the lottery\nin which he had hazarded a venture.\n\nIt was not therefore surprising, such being the general manners of the\nage, that Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw, whom dissipated habits had detached\nin some degree from the best society, should not attend particularly to\nthose feelings in his elected bride to which many men of more sentiment,\nexperience, and reflection would, in all probability, have been equally\nindifferent. He knew what all accounted the principal point, that her\nparents and friends, namely, were decidedly in his favour, and that\nthere existed most powerful reasons for their predilection.\n\nIn truth, the conduct of the Marquis of A----, since Ravenswood's\ndeparture, had been such as almost to bar the possibility of his\nkinsman's union with Lucy Ashton. The Marquis was Ravenswood's sincere\nbut misjudging friend; or rather, like many friends and patrons,\nhe consulted what he considered to be his relation's true interest,\nalthough he knew that in doing so he ran counter to his inclinations.\n\nThe Marquis drove on, therefore, with the plentitude of ministerial\nauthority, an appeal to the British House of Peers against those\njudgments of the courts of law by which Sir William became possessed of\nRavenswood's hereditary property. As this measure, enforced with all the\nauthority of power, was new in Scottish judicial proceedings, though now\nso frequently resorted to, it was exclaimed against by the lawyers\non the opposite side of politics, as an interference with the civil\njudicature of the country, equally new, arbitrary, and tyrannical. And\nif it thus affected even strangers connected with them only by political\nparty, it may be guessed what the Ashton family themselves said\nand thought under so gross a dispensation. Sir William, still more\nworldly-minded than he was timid, was reduced to despair by the loss\nby which he was threatened. His son's haughtier spirit was exalted into\nrage at the idea of being deprived of his expected patrimony. But to\nLady Ashton's yet more vindictive temper the conduct of Ravenswood, or\nrather of his patron, appeared to be an offence challenging the deepest\nand most immortal revenge. Even the quiet and confiding temper of Lucy\nherself, swayed by the opinions expressed by all around her, could not\nbut consider the conduct of Ravenswood as precipitate, and even unkind.\n“It was my father,” she repeated with a sigh, “who welcomed him to this\nplace, and encouraged, or at least allowed, the intimacy between us.\nShould he not have remembered this, and requited it with at least some\nmoderate degree of procrastination in the assertion of his own alleged\nrights? I would have forfeited for him double the value of these lands,\nwhich he pursues with an ardour that shows he has forgotten how much I\nam implicated in the matter.”\n\nLucy, however, could only murmur these things to herself, unwilling to\nincrease the prejudices against her lover entertained by all around\nher, who exclaimed against the steps pursued on his account as illegal,\nvexatious, and tyrannical, resembling the worst measures in the worst\ntimes of the worst Stuarts, and a degradation of Scotland, the decisions\nof whose learned judges were thus subjected to the review of a court\ncomposed indeed of men of the highest rank, and who were not trained to\nthe study of any municipal law, and might be supposed specially to hold\nin contempt that of Scotland. As a natural consequence of the alleged\ninjustice meditated towards her father, every means was restored to, and\nevery argument urged to induce Miss Ashton to break off her engagement\nwith Ravenswood, as being scandalous, shameful, and sinful, formed with\nthe mortal enemy of her family, and calculated to add bitterness to the\ndistress of her parents.\n\nLucy's spirit, however, was high, and, although unaided and alone,\nshe could have borne much: she could have endured the repinings of her\nfather; his murmurs against what he called the tyrannical usage of the\nruling party; his ceaseless charges of ingratitude against Ravenswood;\nhis endless lectures on the various means by which contracts may be\nvoided and annulled; his quotations from the civil, municipal, and the\ncanon law; and his prelections upon the patria potestas.\n\nShe might have borne also in patience, or repelled with scorn, the\nbitter taunts and occasional violence of her brother, Colonel Douglas\nAshton, and the impertinent and intrusive interference of other friends\nand relations. But it was beyond her power effectually to withstand or\nelude the constant and unceasing persecution of Lady Ashton, who, laying\nevery other wish aside, had bent the whol efforts of her powerful\nmind to break her daughter's contract with Ravenswood, and to place\na perpetual bar between the lovers, by effecting Lucy's union with\nBucklaw. Far more deeply skilled than her husband in the recesses of the\nhuman heart, she was aware that in this way she might strike a blow of\ndeep and decisive vengeance upon one whom she esteemed as her mortal\nenemy; nor did she hesitate at raising her arm, although she knew that\nthe wound must be dealt through the bosom of her daughter. With this\nstern and fixed purpose, she sounded every deep and shallow of her\ndaughter's soul, assumed alternately every disguise of manner which\ncould serve her object, and prepared at leisure every species of dire\nmachinery by which the human mind can be wrenched from its settled\ndetermination. Some of these were of an obvious description, and require\nonly to be cursorily mentioned; others were characteristic of the time,\nthe country, and the persons engaged in this singular drama.\n\nIt was of the last consequence that all intercourse betwixt the lovers\nshould be stopped, and, by dint of gold and authority, Lady Ashton\ncontrived to possess herself of such a complete command of all who were\nplaced around her daughter, that, if fact, no leaguered fortress was\never more completely blockaded; while, at the same time, to all outward\nappearance Miss Ashton lay under no restriction. The verge of her\nparents' domains became, in respect to her, like the viewless and\nenchanted line drawn around a fairy castle, where nothing unpermitted\ncan either enter from without or escape from within. Thus every letter,\nin which Ravenswood conveyed to Lucy Ashton the indispensable reasons\nwhich detained him abroad, and more than one note which poor Lucy had\naddressed to him through what she thought a secure channel, fell into\nthe hands of her mother. It could not be but that the tenor of these\nintercepted letters, especially those of Ravenswood, should contain\nsomething to irritate the passions and fortify the obstinacy of her into\nwhose hands they fell; but Lady Ashton's passions were too deep-rooted\nto require this fresh food. She burnt the papers as regularly as she\nperused them; and as they consumed into vapour and tinder, regarded them\nwith a smile upon her compressed lips, and an exultation in her steady\neye, which showed her confidence that the hopes of the writers should\nsoon be rendered equally unsubstantial.\n\nIt usually happens that fortune aids the machinations of those who are\nprompt to avail themselves of every chance that offers. A report was\nwafted from the continent, founded, like others of the same sort, upon\nmany plausible circumstances, but without any real basis, stating the\nMaster of Ravenswood to be on the eve of marriage with a foreign lady\nof fortune and distinction. This was greedily caught up by both the\npolitical parties, who were at once struggling for power and for popular\nfavour, and who seized, as usual, upon the most private circumstances\nin the lives of each other's partisans to convert them into subjects of\npolitical discussion.\n\nThe Marquis of A---- gave his opinion aloud and publicly, not indeed in\nthe coarse terms ascribed to him by Captain Craigengelt, but in a manner\nsufficiently offensive to the Ashtons. “He thought the report,” he said,\n“highly probably, and heartily wished it might be true. Such a match\nwas fitter and far more creditable for a spirited young fellow than a\nmarriage with the daughter of an old Whig lawyer, whose chicanery had so\nnearly ruined his father.”\n\nThe other party, of course, laying out of view the opposition which the\nMaster of Ravenswood received from Miss Ashton's family, cried shame\nupon his fickleness and perfidy, as if he had seduced the young lady\ninto an engagement, and wilfully and causelessly abandoned her for\nanother.\n\nSufficient care was taken that this report should find its way to\nRavenswood Castle through every various channel, Lady Ashton being\nwell aware that the very reiteration of the same rumour, from so many\nquarters, could not but give it a semblance of truth. By some it was\ntold as a piece of ordinary news, by some communicated as serious\nintelligence; now it was whispered to Lucy Ashton's ear in the tone of\nmalignant pleasantry, and now transmitted to her as a matter of grave\nand serious warning.\n\nEven the boy Henry was made the instrument of adding to his sister's\ntorments. One morning he rushed into the room with a willow branch in\nhis hand, which he told her had arrived that instant from Germany for\nher special wearing. Lucy, as we have seen, was remarkably fond of\nher younger brother, and at that moment his wanton and thoughtless\nunkindness seemed more keenly injurious than even the studied insults of\nher elder brother. Her grief, however, had no shade of resentment; she\nfolded her arms about the boy's neck, and saying faintly, “Poor Henry!\nyou speak but what they tell you” she burst into a flood of unrestrained\ntears. The boy was moved, notwithstanding the thoughtlessness of his age\nand character. “The devil take me,” said he, “Lucy, if I fetch you any\nmore of these tormenting messages again; for I like you better,” said\nhe, kissing away the tears, “than the whole pack of them; and you shall\nhave my grey pony to ride on, and you shall canter him if you like--ay,\nand ride beyond the village, too, if you have a mind.”\n\n“Who told you,” said Lucy, “that I am not permitted to ride where I\nplease?”\n\n“That's a secret,” said the boy; “but you will find you can never ride\nbeyond the village but your horse will cast a shoe, or fall lame, or the\ncattle bell will ring, or something will happen to bring you back. But\nif I tell you more of these things, Douglas will nto get me the pair of\ncolours they have promised me, and so good-morrow to you.”\n\nThis dialogue plunged Lucy in still deeper dejection, as it tended to\nshow her plainly what she had for some time suspected, that she was\nlittle better than a prisoner at large in her father's house. We have\ndescribed her in the outset of our story as of a romantic disposition,\ndelighting in tales of love and wonder, and readily identifying herself\nwith the situation of those legendary heroines with whose adventures,\nfor want of better reading, her memory had become stocked. The fairy\nwand, with which in her solitude she had delighted to raise visions of\nenchantment, became now the rod of a magician, the bond slave of evil\n_genii_, serving only to invoke spectres at which the exorcist trembled.\nShe felt herself the object of suspicion, of scorn, of dislike at least,\nif not of hatred, to her own family; and it seemed to her that she was\nabandoned by the very person on whose account she was exposed to\nthe enmity of all around her. Indeed, the evidence of Ravenswood's\ninfidelity began to assume every day a more determined character.\nA soldier of fortune, of the name of Westenho, an old familiar of\nCraigengelt's, chanced to arrive from abroad about this time. The worthy\nCaptain, though without any precise communication with Lady Ashton,\nalways acted most regularly and sedulously in support of her plans,\nand easily prevailed upon his friend, by dint of exaggeration of real\ncircumstances and coming of others, to give explicit testimony to the\ntruth of Ravenswood's approaching marriage.\n\nThus beset on all hands, and in a manner reduced to despair, Lucy's\ntemper gave way under the pressure of constant affliction and\npersecution. She became gloomy and abstracted, and, contrary to her\nnatural and ordinary habit of mind, sometimes turned with spirit, and\neven fierceness, on those by whom she was long and closely annoyed. Her\nhealth also began to be shaken, and her hectic cheek and wandering\neye gave symptoms of what is called a fever upon the spirits. In most\nmothers this would have moved compassion; but Lady Ashton, compact and\nfirm of purpose, saw these waverings of health and intellect with no\ngreater sympathy than that with which the hostile engineer regards the\ntowers of a beleaguered city as they reel under the discharge of his\nartillery; or rather, she considered these starts and inequalities of\ntemper as symptoms of Lucy's expiring resolution; as the angler, by the\nthroes and convulsive exertions of the fish which he has hooked,\nbecomes aware that he soon will be able to land him. To accelerate\nthe catastrophe in the present case, Lady Ashton had recourse to an\nexpedient very consistent with the temper and credulity of those times,\nbut which the reader will probably pronounce truly detestable and\ndiabolical.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\n     In which a witch did dwell, in loathly weeds,\n     And wilful want, all careless of her deeds;\n     So choosing solitary to abide,\n     Far from all neighbours, that her devilish deeds\n     And hellish arts from people she might hide,\n     And hurt far off, unknown, whome'er she envied.\n\n     Faerie Queene.\n\nTHE health of Lucy Ashton soon required the assistance of a person more\nskilful in the office of a sick-nurse than the female domestics of the\nfamily. Ailsie Gourlay, sometimes called the Wise Woman of Bowden, was\nthe person whom, for her own strong reasons, Lady Ashton selected as an\nattendant upon her daughter.\n\nThis woman had acquired a considerable reputation among the ignorant by\nthe pretended cures which she performed, especially in “oncomes,” as\nthe Scotch call them, or mysterious diseases, which baffle the regular\nphysician. Her pharmacopoeia consisted partly of herbs selected in\nplanetary hours, partly of words, signs, and charms, which sometimes,\nperhaps, produced a favourable influence upon the imagination of her\npatients. Such was the avowed profession of Luckie Gourlay, which, as\nmay well be supposed, was looked upon with a suspicious eye, not only\nby her neighbours, but even by the clergy of the district. In\nprivate, however, she traded more deeply in the occult sciences; for,\nnotwithstanding the dreadful punishments inflicted upon the supposed\ncrime of witchcraft, there wanted not those who, steeled by want and\nbitterness of spirit, were willing to adopt the hateful and dangerous\ncharacter, for the sake of the influence which its terrors enabled them\nto exercise in the vicinity, and the wretched emolument which they could\nextract by the practice of their supposed art.\n\nAilsie Gourlay was not indeed fool enough to acknowledge a compact with\nthe Evil One, which would have been a swift and ready road to the stake\nand tar-barrel. Her fairy, she said, like Caliban's, was a harmless\nfairy. Nevertheless, she “spaed fortunes,” read dreams, composed\nphiltres, discovered stolen goods, and made and dissolved matches as\nsuccessfully as if, according to the belief of the whole neighbourhood,\nshe had been aided in those arts by Beelzebub himself. The worst of the\npretenders to these sciences was, that they were generally persons who,\nfeeling themselves odious to humanity, were careless of what they did\nto deserve the public hatred. Real crimes were often committed under\npretence of magical imposture; and it somewhat relieves the disgust\nwith which we read, in the criminal records, the conviction of\nthese wretches, to be aware that many of them merited, as poisoners,\nsuborners, and diabolical agents in secret domestic crimes, the severe\nfate to which they were condemned for the imaginary guilt of witchcraft.\n\nSuch was Aislie Gourlay, whom, in order to attain the absolute\nsubjugation of Lucy Ashton's mind, her mother thought it fitting to\nplace near her person. A woman of less consequence than Lady Ashton\nhad not dared to take such a step; but her high rank and strength of\ncharacter set her above the censure of the world, and she was allowed to\nhave selected for her daughter's attendant the best and most experienced\nsick-nurse and “mediciner” in the neighbourhood, where an inferior\nperson would have fallen under the reproach of calling in the assistance\nof a partner and ally of the great Enemy of mankind.\n\nThe beldam caught her cue readily and by innuendo, without giving\nLady Ashton the pain of distinct explanation. She was in many respects\nqualified for the part she played, which indeed could not be efficiently\nassumed without some knowledge of the human heart and passions. Dame\nGourlay perceived that Lucy shuddered at her external appearance, which\nwe have already described when we found her in the death-chamber of\nblind Alice; and while internally she hated the poor girl for the\ninvoluntary horror with which she saw she was regarded, she commenced\nher operations by endeavouring to efface or overcome those prejudices\nwhich, in her heart, she resented as mortal offences. This was easily\ndone, for the hag's external ugliness was soon balanced by a show of\nkindness and interest, to which Lucy had of late been little accustomed;\nher attentive services and real skill gained her the ear, if not the\nconfidence, of her patient; and under pretence of diverting the solitude\nof a sick-room, she soon led her attention captive by the legends in\nwhich she was well skilled, and to which Lucy's habit of reading and\nreflection induced her to “lend an attentive ear.” Dame Gourlay's tales\nwere at first of a mild and interesting character--\n\n     Of fays that nightly dance upon the wold,\n     And lovers doom'd to wander and to weep,\n     And castles high, where wicked wizards keep\n     Their captive thralls.\n\nGradually, however, they assumed a darker and more mysterious character,\nand became such as, told by the midnight lamp, and enforced by the\ntremulous tone, the quivering and livid lip, the uplifted skinny\nforefinger, and the shaking head of the blue-eyed hag, might have\nappalled a less credulous imagination in an age more hard of belief. The\nold Sycorax saw her advantage, and gradually narrowed her magic circle\naround the devoted victim on whose spirit she practised. Her legends\nbegan to relate to the fortunes of the Ravenswood family, whose ancient\ngrandeur and portentous authority credulity had graced with so many\nsuperstitious attributes. The story of the fatal fountain was narrated\nat full length, and with formidable additions, by the ancient sibyl. The\nprophecy, quoted by Caleb, concerning the dead bride who was to be won\nby the last of the Ravenswoods, had its own mysterious commentary;\nand the singular circumstance of the apparition seen by the Master of\nRavenswood in the forest, having partly transpired through his\nhasty inquiries in the cottage of Old Alice, formed a theme for many\nexaggerations.\n\nLucy might have despised these tales if they had been related concerning\nanother family, or if her own situation had been less despondent. But\ncircumstanced as she was, the idea that an evil fate hung over her\nattachment became predominant over her other feelings; and the gloom\nof superstition darkened a mind already sufficiently weakened by\nsorrow, distress, uncertainty, and an oppressive sense of desertion and\ndesolation. Stories were told by her attendant so closely resembling her\nown in their circumstances, that she was gradually led to converse upon\nsuch tragic and mystical subjects with the beldam, and to repose a sort\nof confidence in the sibyl, whom she still regarded with involuntary\nshuddering. Dame Gourlay knew how to avail herself of this imperfect\nconfidence. She directed Lucy's thoughts to the means of inquiring into\nfuturity--the surest mode perhaps, of shaking the understanding and\ndestroying the spirits. Omens were expounded, dreams were interpreted,\nand other tricks of jugglery perhaps resorted to, by which the pretended\nadepts of the period deceived and fascinated their deluded followers. I\nfind it mentioned in the articles of distay against Ailsie Gourlay--for\nit is some comfort to know that the old hag was tried, condemned, and\nburned on the top of North Berwick Law, by sentence of a commission\nfrom the privy council--I find, I say, it was charged against her, among\nother offences, that she had, by the aid and delusions of Satan, shown\nto a young person of quality, in a mirror glass, a gentleman then\nabroad, to whom the said young person was betrothed, and who appeared in\nthe vision to be in the act of bestowing his hand upon another lady. But\nthis and some other parts of the record appear to have been studiously\nleft imperfect in names and dates, probably out of regard to the honour\nof the families concerned. If Dame Gourlay was able actually to play\noff such a piece of jugglery, it is clear she must have had better\nassistance to practise the deception than her own skill or funds could\nsupply. Meanwhile, this mysterious visionary traffic had its usual\neffect in unsettling Miss Ashton's mind. Her temper became unequal,\nher health decayed daily, her manners grew moping, melancholy,\nand uncertain. Her father, guessing partly at the cause of these\nappearances, made a point of banishing Dame Gourlay from the castle;\nbut the arrow was shot, and was rankling barb-deep in the side of the\nwounded deer.\n\nIt was shortly after the departure of this woman, that Lucy Ashton,\nurged by her parents, announced to them, with a vivacity by which they\nwere startled, “That she was conscious heaven and earth and hell had set\nthemselves against her union with Ravenswood; still her contract,” she\nsaid, “was a binding contract, and she neither would nor could resign\nit without the consent of Ravenswood. Let me be assured,” she concluded,\n“that he will free me from my engagement, and dispose of me as you\nplease, I care not how. When the diamonds are gone, what signifies the\ncasket?”\n\nThe tone of obstinacy with which this was said, her eyes flashing\nwith unnatural light, and her hands firmly clenched, precluded the\npossibility of dispute; and the utmost length which Lady Ashton's art\ncould attain, only got her the privilege of dictating the letter, by\nwhich her daughter required to know of Ravenswood whether he intended to\nabide by or to surrender what she termed “their unfortunate engagement.”\n Of this advantage Lady Ashton so far and so ingeniously availed herself\nthat, according to the wording of the letter, the reader would have\nsupposed Lucy was calling upon her lover to renounce a contract which\nwas contrary to the interests and inclinations of both. Not trusting\neven to this point of deception, Lady Ashton finally determined to\nsuppress the letter altogether, in hopes that Lucy's impatience would\ninduce her to condemn Ravenswood unheard and in absence. In this she was\ndisappointed. The time, indeed, had long elapsed when an answer should\nhave been received from the continent. The faint ray of hope which still\nglimmered in Lucy's mind was well nigh extinguished. But the idea never\nforsook her that her letter might not have been duly forwarded. One of\nher mother's new machinations unexpectedly furnished her with the means\nof ascertaining what she most desired to know.\n\nThe female agent of hell having been dismissed from the castle, Lady\nAshton, who wrought by all variety of means, resolved to employ, for\nworking the same end on Lucy's mind, an agent of a very different\ncharacter. This was no other than the Reverent Mr. Bide-the-Bent, a\npresbyterian clergyman, formerly mentioned, of the very strictest\norder and the most rigid orthodoxy, whose aid she called in, upon the\nprinciple of the tyrant in the in the tragedy:\n\n     I'll have a priest shall preach her from her faith,\n     And make it sin not to renounce that vow\n     Which I'd have broken.\n\nBut Lady Ashton was mistaken in the agent she had selected. His\nprejudices, indeed, were easily enlisted on her side, and it was no\ndifficult matter to make him regard with horror the prospect of a union\nbetwixt the daughter of a God-fearing, professing, and Presbyterian\nfamily of distinction and the heir of a bloodthirsty prelatist and\npersecutor, the hands of whose fathers had been dyed to the wrists in\nthe blood of God's saints. This resembled, in the divine's opinion, the\nunion of a Moabitish stranger with a daughter of Zion. But with all\nthe more severe prejudices and principles of his sect, Bide-the-Bent\npossessed a sound judgment, and had learnt sympathy even in that very\nschool of persecution where the heart is so frequently hardened. In a\nprivate interview with Miss Ashton, he was deeply moved by her distress,\nand could not but admit the justice of her request to be permitted a\ndirect communication with Ravenswood upon the subject of their solemn\ncontract. When she urged to him the great uncertainty under which she\nlaboured whether her letter had been ever forwarded, the old man paced\nthe room with long steps, shook his grey head, rested repeatedly for a\nspace on his ivory-headed staff, and, after much hesitation, confessed\nthat he thought her doubts so reasonable that he would himself aid in\nthe removal of them.\n\n“I cannot but opine, Miss Lucy,” he said, “that your worshipful lady\nmother hath in this matter an eagerness whilk, although it ariseth\ndoubtless from love to your best interests here and hereafter, for the\nman is of persecuting blood, and himself a persecutor, a Cavalier\nor Malignant, and a scoffer, who hath no inheritance in Jesse;\nnevertheless, we are commanded to do justice unto all, and to fulfil\nour bond and covenant, as well to the stranger as to him who is in\nbrotherhood with us. Wherefore myself, even I myself, will be aiding\nunto the delivery of your letter to the man Edgar Ravenswood, trusting\nthat the issue thereof may be your deliverance from the nets in which he\nhath sinfully engaged you. And that I may do in this neither more nor\nless than hath been warranted by your honourable parents, I pray you\nto transcribe, without increment or subtraction, the letter formerly\nexpeded under the dictation of your right honourable mother; and I shall\nput it into such sure course of being delivered, that if, honourable\nyoung madam, you shall receive no answer, it will be necessary that\nyou conclude that the man meaneth in silence to abandon that naughty\ncontract, which, peradventure, he may be unwilling directly to restore.”\n\nLucy eagerly embraced the expedient of the worthy divine. A new letter\nwas written in the precise terms of the former, and consigned by Mr.\nBide-the-Bent to the charge of Saunders Moonshine, a zealous elder of\nthe church when on shore, and when on board his brig as bold a smuggler\nas ever ran out a sliding bowsprit to the winds that blow betwixt\nCampvere and the east coast of Scotland. At the recommendation of his\npastor, Saunders readily undertook that the letter should be securely\nconveyed to the Master of Ravenswood at the court where he now resided.\n\nThis retrospect became necessary to explain the conference betwixt Miss\nAshton, her mother, and Bucklaw which we have detailed in a preceding\nchapter.\n\nLucy was now like the sailor who, while drifting through a tempestuous\nocean, clings for safety to a single plank, his powers of grasping it\nbecoming every moment more feeble, and the deep darkness of the night\nonly checkered by the flashes of lightning, hissing as they show the\nwhite tops of the billows, in which he is soon to be engulfed.\n\nWeek crept away after week, and day after day. St. Jude's day arrived,\nthe last and protracted term to which Lucy had limited herself, and\nthere was neither letter nor news of Ravenswood.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\n     How fair these names, how much unlike they look\n     To all the blurr'd subscriptions in my book!\n     The bridegroom's letters stand in row above,\n     Tapering, yet straight, like pine-trees in his grove;\n     While free and fine the bride's appear below,\n     As light and slender as her jessamines grow.\n\n     CRABBE.\n\nST. JUDE's day came, the term assigned by Lucy herself as the furthest\ndate of expectation, and, as we have already said, there were neither\nletters from nor news of Ravenswood. But there were news of Bucklaw, and\nof his trusty associate Craigengelt, who arrived early in the morning\nfor the completion of the proposed espousals, and for signing the\nnecessary deeds.\n\nThese had been carefully prepared under the revisal of Sir William\nAshton himself, it having been resolved, on account of the state of Miss\nAshton's health, as it was said, that none save the parties immediately\ninterested should be present when the parchments were subscribed. It\nwas further determined that the marriage should be solemnised upon the\nfourth day after signing the articles, a measure adopted by Lady Ashton,\nin order that Lucy might have as little time as possible to recede or\nrelapse into intractability. There was no appearance, however, of\nher doing either. She heard the proposed arrangement with the calm\nindifference of despair, or rather with an apathy arising from the\noppressed and stupified state of her feelings. To an eye so unobserving\nas that of Bucklaw, her demeanour had little more of reluctance than\nmight suit the character of a bashful young lady, who, however, he could\nnot disguise from himself, was complying with the choice of her friends\nrather than exercising any personal predilection in his favour.\n\nWhen the morning compliment of the bridegroom had been paid, Miss Ashton\nwas left for some time to herself; her mother remarking, that the deeds\nmust be signed before the hour of noon, in order that the marriage might\nbe happy. Lucy suffered herself to be attired for the occasion as the\ntaste of her attendants suggested, and was of course splendidly arrayed.\nHer dress was composed of white satin and Brussels lace, and her\nhair arranged with a profusion of jewels, whose lustre made a strange\ncontrast to the deadly paleness of her complexion, and to the trouble\nwhich dwelt in her unsettled eye.\n\nHer toilette was hardly finished ere Henry appeared, to conduct the\npassive bride to the state apartment, where all was prepared for signing\nthe contract. “Do you know, sister,” he said, “I am glad you are to\nhave Bucklaw after all, instead of Ravenswood, who looked like a Spanish\ngrandee come to cut our throats and trample our bodies under foot.\nAnd I am glad the broad seas are between us this day, for I shall never\nforget how frightened I was when I took him for the picture of old Sir\nMalise walked out of the canvas. Tell me true, are you not glad to be\nfairly shot of him?”\n\n“Ask me no questions, dear Henry,” said his unfortunate sister; “there\nis little more can happen to make me either glad or sorry in this\nworld.”\n\n“And that's what all young brides say,” said Henry; “and so do not be\ncast down, Lucy, for you'll tell another tale a twelvemonth hence; and I\nam to be bride's-man, and ride before you to the kirk; and all our kith,\nkin, and allies, and all Bucklaw's, are to be mounted and in order; and\nI am to have a scarlet laced coat, and a feathered hat, and a sword-belt,\ndouble bordered with gold, and point d'Espagne, and a dagger instead of\na sword; and I should like a sword much better, but my father won't\nhear of it. All my things, and a hundred besides, are to come out from\nEdinburgh to-night with old Gilbert and the sumpter mules; and I will\nbring them and show them to you the instant they come.”\n\nThe boy's chatter was here interrupted by the arrival of Lady Ashton,\nsomewhat alarmed at her daughter's stay. With one of her sweetest\nsmiles, she took Lucy's arm under her own.\n\nThere were only present, Sir William Ashton and Colonel Douglas Ashton,\nthe last in full regimentals; Bucklaw, in bridegroom trim; Craigengelt,\nfreshly equipt from top to toe by the bounty of his patron, and\nbedizened with as much lace as might have become the dress of the Copper\nCaptain; together with the Rev. Mr. Bide-the-Bent; the presence of\na minister being, in strict Presbyterian families, an indispensable\nrequisite upon all occasions of unusual solemnity.\n\nWines and refreshments were placed on a table, on which the writings\nwere displayed, ready for signature.\n\nBut before proceeding either to business or refreshment, Mr.\nBide-the-Bent, at a signal from Sir William Ashton, invited the company\nto join him in a short extemporary prayer, in which he implored a\nblessing upon the contract now to be solemnised between the honourable\nparties then present. With the simplicity of his times and profession,\nwhich permitted strong personal allusions, he petitioned that the\nwounded mind of one of these noble parties might be healed, in reward\nof her compliance with the advice of her right honourable parents; and\nthat, as she had proved herself a child after God's commandment, by\nhonouring her father and mother, she and hers might enjoy the promised\nblessing--length of days in the land here, and a happy portion hereafter\nin a better country. He prayed farther, that the bridegroom might\nbe weaned from those follies which seduced youth from the path of\nknowledge; that he might cease to take delight in vain and unprofitable\ncompany, scoffers, rioters, and those who sit late at the wine (here\nBucklaw winked at Craigengelt), and cease from the society that causeth\nto err. A suitable supplication in behalf of Sir William and Lady Ashton\nand their family concluded this religious address, which thus embraced\nevery individual present excepting Craigengelt, whom the worthy divine\nprobably considered as past all hopes of grace.\n\nThe business of the day now went forward: Sir William Ashton signed\nthe contract with legal solemnity and precision; his son, with military\nnonchalance; and Bucklaw, having subscribed as rapidly as Craigengelt\ncould manage to turn the leaves, concluded by wiping his pen on that\nworthy's new laced cravat. It was now Miss Ashton's turn to sign the\nwritings, and she was guided by her watchful mother to the table for\nthat purpose. At her first attempt, she began to write with a dry pen,\nand when the circumstance was pointed out, seemed unable, after several\nattempts, to dip it in the massive silver ink-standish, which stood full\nbefore her. Lady Ashton's vigilance hastened to supply the deficiency. I\nhave myself seen the fatal deed, and in the distinct characters in which\nthe name of Lucy Ashton is traced on each page there is only a very\nslight tremulous irregularity, indicative of her state of mind at the\ntime of the subscription. But the last signature is incomplete, defaced,\nand blotted; for, while her hand was employed in tracing it, the hasty\ntramp of a horse was heard at the gate, succeeded by a step in the\nouter gallery, and a voice which, in a commanding tone, bore down the\nopposition of the menials. The pen dropped from Lucy's fingers, as she\nexclaimed with a faint shriek: “He is come--he is come!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\n     This by his tongue should be a Montague!\n     Fetch me my rapier, boy;\n     Now, by the faith and honour of my kin,\n     To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.\n\n     Romeo and Juliet.\n\nHARDLY had Miss Ashton dropped the pen, when the door of the apartment\nflew open, and the Master of Ravenswood entered the apartment.\n\nLockhard and another domestic, who had in vain attempted to oppose his\npassage through the gallery or antechamber, were seen standing on the\nthreshold transfixed with surprise, which was instantly communicated to\nthe whole party in the state-room. That of Colonel Douglas Ashton was\nmingled with resentment; that of Bucklaw with haughty and affected\nindifference; the rest, even Lady Ashton herself, showed signs of\nfear; and Lucy seemed stiffened to stone by this unexpected apparition.\nApparition it might well be termed, for Ravenswood had more the\nappearance of one returned from the dead than of a living visitor.\n\nHe planted himself full in the middle of the apartment, opposite to the\ntable at which Lucy was seated, on whom, as if she had been alone in the\nchamber, he bent his eyes with a mingled expression of deep grief and\ndeliberate indignation. His dark-coloured riding cloak, displaced from\none shoulder, hung around one side of his person in the ample folds of\nthe Spanish mantle. The rest of his rich dress was travel-soiled, and\nderanged by hard riding. He had a sword by his side, and pistols in his\nbelt. His slouched hat, which he had not removed at entrance, gave\nan additional gloom to his dark features, which, wasted by sorrow and\nmarked by the ghastly look communicated by long illness, added to a\ncountenance naturally somewhat stern and wild a fierce and even savage\nexpression. The matted and dishevelled locks of hair which escaped from\nunder his hat, together with his fixed and unmoved posture, made his\nhead more resemble that of a marble bust than that of a living man. He\nsaid not a single word, and there was a deep silence in the company for\nmore than two minutes.\n\nIt was broken by Lady Ashton, who in that space partly recovered her\nnatural audacity. She demanded to know the cause of this unauthorised\nintrusion.\n\n“That is a question, madam,” said her son, “which I have the best right\nto ask; and I must request of the Master of Ravenswood to follow me\nwhere he can answer it at leisure.”\n\nBucklaw interposed, saying, “No man on earth should usurp his previous\nright in demanding an explanation from the Master. Craigengelt,” he\nadded, in an undertone, “d--n ye, why do you stand staring as if you saw\na ghost? fetch me my sword from the gallery.”\n\n“I will relinquish to none,” said Colonel Ashton, “my right of calling\nto account the man who has offered this unparalleled affront to my\nfamily.” “Be patient, gentlemen,” said Ravenswood, turning sternly\ntowards them, and waving his hand as if to impose silence on their\naltercation. “If you are as weary of your lives as I am, I will find\ntime and place to pledge mine against one or both; at present, I have no\nleisure for the disputes of triflers.”\n\n“Triflers!” echoed Colonel Ashton, half unsheathing his sword, while\nBucklaw laid his hand on the hilt of that which Craigengelt had just\nreached him.\n\nSir William Ashton, alarmed for his son's safety, rushed between the\nyoung men and Ravenswood, exclaiming: “My son, I command you--Bucklaw, I\nentreat you--keep the peace, in the name of the Queen and of the law!”\n\n“In the name of the law of God,” said Bide-the-Bent, advancing also with\nuplifted hands between Bucklaw, the Colonel, and the object of their\nresentment--“in the name of Him who brought peace on earth and good-will\nto mankind, I implore--I beseech--I command you to forbear violence\ntowards each other! God hateth the bloodthirsty man; he who striketh\nwith the sword shall perish with the sword.”\n\n“Do you take me for a dog, sir” said Colonel Ashton, turning fiercely\nupon him, “or something more brutally stupid, to endure this insult in\nmy father's house? Let me go, Bucklaw! He shall account to me, or, by\nHeavens, I will stab him where he stands!”\n\n“You shall not touch him here,” said Bucklaw; “he once gave me my\nlife, and were he the devil come to fly away with the whole house and\ngeneration, he shall have nothing but fair play.”\n\nThe passions of the two young men thus counteracting each other\ngave Ravenswood leisure to exclaim, in a stern and steady voice:\n“Silence!--let him who really seeks danger take the fitting time when\nit is to be found; my mission here will be shortly accomplished. Is THAT\nyour handwriting, madam?” he added in a softer tone, extending towards\nMiss Ashton her last letter.\n\nA faltering “Yes” seemed rather to escape from her lips than to be\nuttered as a voluntary answer.\n\n“And is THIS also your handwriting?” extending towards her the mutual\nengagement.\n\nLucy remained silent. Terror, and a yet stronger and more confused\nfeeling, so utterly disturbed her understanding that she probably\nscarcely comprehended the question that was put to her.\n\n“If you design,” said Sir William Ashton, “to found any legal claim on\nthat paper, sir, do not expect to receive any answer to an extrajudicial\nquestion.”\n\n“Sir William Ashton,” said Ravenswood, “I pray you, and all who hear\nme, that you will not mistake my purpose. If this young lady, of her own\nfree will, desires the restoration of this contract, as her letter\nwould seem to imply, there is not a withered leaf which this autumn wind\nstrews on the heath that is more valueless in my eyes. But I must and\nwill hear the truth from her own mouth; without this satisfaction I will\nnot leave this spot. Murder me by numbers you possibly may; but I am\nan armed man--I am a desperate man, and I will not die without ample\nvengeance. This is my resolution, take it as you may. I WILL hear her\ndetermination from her own mouth; from her own mouth, alone, and without\nwitnesses, will I hear it. Now, choose,” he said, drawing his sword with\nthe right hand, and, with the left, by the same motion taking a pistol\nfrom his belt and cocking it, but turning the point of one weapon and\nthe muzzle of the other to the ground--“choose if you will have this\nhall floated with blood, or if you will grant me the decisive interview\nwith my affianced bride which the laws of God and the country alike\nentitle me to demand.”\n\nAll recoiled at the sound of his voice and the determined action by\nwhich it was accompanied; for the ecstasy of real desperation seldom\nfails to overpower the less energetic passions by which it may be\nopposed. The clergyman was the first to speak. “In the name of God,” he\nsaid, “receive an overture of peace from the meanest of His servants.\nWhat this honourable person demands, albeit it is urged with over\nviolence, hath yet in it something of reason. Let him hear from Miss\nLucy's own lips that she hath dutifully acceded to the will of her\nparents, and repenteth her of her covenant with him; and when he is\nassured of this he will depart in peace unto his own dwelling, and\ncumber us no more. Alas! the workings of the ancient Adam are strong\neven in the regenerate; surely we should have long-suffering with those\nwho, being yet in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity, are swept\nforward by the uncontrollable current of worldly passion. Let then, the\nMaster of Ravenswood have the interview on which he insisteth; it can\nbut be as a passing pang to this honourable maiden, since her faith is\nnow irrevocably pledged to the choice of her parents. Let it, I say, be\nthis: it belongeth to my functions to entreat your honours' compliance\nwith this headling overture.”\n\n“Never!” answered Lady Ashton, whose rage had now overcome her first\nsurprise and terror--“never shall this man speak in private with my\ndaughter, the affianced bride of another! pass from this room who will,\nI remain here. I fear neither his violence nor his weapons, though some,”\n she said, glancing a look towards Colonel Ashton, “who bear my name\nappear more moved by them.”\n\n“For God's sake, madam,” answered the worthy divine, “add not fuel to\nfirebrands. The Master of Ravenswood cannot, I am sure, object to your\npresence, the young lady's state of health being considered, and your\nmaternal duty. I myself will also tarry; peradventure my grey hairs may\nturn away wrath.”\n\n“You are welcome to do so, sir,” said Ravenswood; “and Lady Ashton is\nalso welcome to remain, if she shall think proper; but let all others\ndepart.”\n\n“Ravenswood,” said Colonel Ashton, crossing him as he went out, “you\nshall account for this ere long.”\n\n“When you please,” replied Ravenswood.\n\n“But I,” said Bucklaw, with a half smile, “have a prior demand on your\nleisure, a claim of some standing.”\n\n“Arrange it as you will,” said Ravenswood; “leave me but this day in\npeace, and I will have no dearer employment on earth to-morrow than to\ngive you all the satisfaction you can desire.”\n\nThe other gentlemen left the apartment; but Sir William Ashton lingered.\n\n“Master of Ravenswood,” he said, in a conciliating tone, “I think I have\nnot deserved that you should make this scandal and outrage in my family.\nIf you will sheathe your sword, and retire with me into my study, I will\nprove to you, by the most satisfactory arguments, the inutility of your\npresent irregular procedure----”\n\n“To-morrow, sir--to-morrow--to-morrow, I will hear you at length,”\n reiterated Ravenswood, interrupting him; “this day hath its own sacred\nand indispensable business.”\n\nHe pointed to the door, and Sir William left the apartment.\n\nRavenswood sheathed his sword, uncocked and returned his pistol to his\nbelt; walked deliberately to the door of the apartment, which he bolted;\nreturned, raised his hat from his forehead, and gazing upon Lucy with\neyes in which an expression of sorrow overcame their late fierceness,\nspread his dishevelled locks back from his face, and said, “Do you know\nme, Miss Ashton? I am still Edgar Ravenswood.” She was silent, and he\nwent on with increasing vehemence: “I am still that Edgar Ravenswood\nwho, for your affection, renounced the dear ties by which injured honour\nbound him to seek vengeance. I am that Ravenswood who, for your sake,\nforgave, nay, clasped hands in friendship with, the oppressor and\npillager of his house, the traducer and murderer of his father.”\n\n“My daughter,” answered Lady Ashton, interrupting him, “has no occasion\nto dispute the identity of your person; the venom of your present\nlanguage is sufficient to remind her that she speaks with the mortal\nenemy of her father.”\n\n“I pray you to be patient, madam,” answered Ravenswood; “my answer\nmust come from her own lips. Once more, Miss Lucy Ashton, I am that\nRavenswood to whom you granted the solemn engagement which you now\ndesire to retract and cancel.”\n\nLucy's bloodless lips could only falter out the words, “It was my\nmother.”\n\n“She speaks truly,” said Lady Ashton, “it WAS I who, authorised alike\nby the laws of God and man, advised her, and concurred with her, to\nset aside an unhappy and precipitate engagement, and to annul it by the\nauthority of Scripture itself.”\n\n“Scripture!” said Ravenswood, scornfully.\n\n“Let him hear the text,” said Lady Ashton, appealing to the divine, “on\nwhich you yourself, with cautious reluctance, declared the nullity of\nthe pretended engagement insisted upon by this violent man.”\n\nThe clergyman took his clasped Bible from his pocket, and read the\nfollowing words: “If a woman vow a vow unto the Lord, and bind herself\nby a bond, being in her father's house in her youth, and her father hear\nher vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father\nshall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every\nvow wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.”\n\n“And was it not even so with us?” interrrupted Ravenswood.\n\n“Control thy impatience, young man,” answered the divine, “and hear what\nfollows in the sacred text: 'But if her father disallow her in the day\nthat he heareth, not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath\nbound her soul, shall stand; and the Lord shall forgive her, because her\nfather disallowed her.”\n\n“And was not,” said Lady Ashton, fiercely and triumphantly breaking\nin--“was not ours the case stated in the Holy Writ? Will this person\ndeny, that the instant her parents heard of the vow, or bond, by which\nour daughter had bound her soul, we disallowed the same in the most\nexpress terms, and informed him by writing of our determination?”\n\n“And is this all?” said Ravenswood, looking at Lucy. “Are you willing\nto barter sworn faith, the exercise of free will, and the feelings of\nmutual affection to this wretched hypocritical sophistry?”\n\n“Hear him!” said Lady Ashton, looking to the clergyman--“hear the\nblasphemer!”\n\n“May God forgive him,” said Bide-the-Bent, “and enlighten his\nignorance!”\n\n“Hear what I have sacrificed for you,” said Ravenswood, still addressing\nLucy, “ere you sanction what has been done in your name. The honour of\nan ancient family, the urgent advice of my best friends, have been in\nvain used to sway my resolution; neither the arguments of reason nor\nthe portents of superstition have shaken my fidelity. The very dead have\narisen to warn me, and their warning has been despised. Are you prepared\nto pierce my heart for its fidelity with the very weapon which my rash\nconfidence entrusted to your grasp?”\n\n“Master of Ravenswood,” said Lady Ashton, “you have asked what questions\nyou thought fit. You see the total incapacity of my daughter to answer\nyou. But I will reply for her, and in a manner which you cannot dispute.\nYou desire to know whether Lucy Ashton, of her own free will, desires\nto annul the engagement into which she has been trepanned. You have her\nletter under her own hand, demanding the surrender of it; and, in yet\nmore full evidence of her purpose, here is the contract which she has\nthis morning subscribed, in presence of this reverence gentleman, with\nMr. Hayston of Bucklaw.”\n\nRavenswood gazed upon the deed as if petrified. “And it was without\nfraud or compulsion,” said he, looking towards the clergyman, “that Miss\nAshton subscribed this parchment?”\n\n“I couch it upon my sacred character.”\n\n“This is indeed, madam, an undeniable piece of evidence,” said\nRavenswood, sternly; “and it will be equally unnecessary and\ndishonourable to waste another word in useless remonstrance or reproach.\nThere, madam,” he said, laying down before Lucy the signed paper and the\nbroken piece of gold--“there are the evidences of your first engagement;\nmay you be more faithful to that which you have just formed. I will\ntrouble you to return the corresponding tokens of my ill-placed\nconfidence; I ought rather to say, of my egregious folly.”\n\nLucy returned the scornful glance of her lover with a gaze from which\nperception seemed to have been banished; yet she seemed partly to have\nunderstood his meaning, for she raised her hands as if to undo a blue\nribbon which she wore around her neck. She was unable to accomplish her\npurpose, but Lady Ashton cut the ribbon asunder, and detached the broken\npiece of gold, which Miss Ashton had till then worn concealed in her\nbosom; the written counterpart of the lovers' engagement she for\nsome time had had in her own possession. With a haughty courtesy, she\ndelivered both to Ravenswood, who was much softened when he took the\npiece of gold.\n\n“And she could wear it thus,” he said, speaking to himself--“could wear\nit in her very bosom--could wear it next to her heart--even when---- But\ncomplain avails not,” he said, dashing from his eye the tear which\nhad gathered in it, and resuming the stern composure of his manner. He\nstrode to the chimney, and threw into the fire the paper and piece of\ngold, stamping upon the coals with the heel of his boot, as if to ensure\ntheir destruction. “I will be no longer,” he then said, “an intruder\nhere. Your evil wishes, and your worse offices, Lady Ashton, I will\nonly return by hoping these will be your last machinations against your\ndaughter's honour and happiness. And to you, madam,” he said, addressing\nLucy, “I have nothing farther to say, except to pray to God that you\nmay not become a world's wonder for this act of wilful and deliberate\nperjury.” Having uttered these words, he turned on his heel and left the\napartment.\n\nSir William Ashton, by entreaty and authority, had detained his son and\nBucklaw in a distant part of the castle, in order to prevent their\nagain meeting with Ravenswood; but as the Master descended the great\nstaircase, Lockhard delivered him a billet, signed “Sholto Douglas\nAshton,” requesting to know where the Master of Ravenswood would be\nheard of four or five days from hence, as the writer had business of\nweight to settle with him, so soon as an important family event had\ntaken place.\n\n“Tell Colonel Ashton,” said Ravenswood, composedly, “I shall be found at\nWolf's Crag when his leisure serves him.”\n\nAs he descended the outward stair which led from the terrace, he was\na second time interrupted by Craigengelt, who, on the part of his\nprincipal, the Laird of Bucklaw, expressed a hope that Ravenswood would\nnot leave Scotland within ten days at least, as he had both former and\nrecent civilities for which to express his gratitude.\n\n“Tell your master,” said Ravenswood, fiercely, “to choose his own time.\nHe will find me at Wolf's Crag, if his purpose is not forestalled.”\n\n“MY master!” replied Craigengelt, encouraged by seeing Colonel Ashton\nand Bucklaw at the bottom of the terrace. “Give me leave to say I know\nof no such person upon earth, nor will I permit such language to be used\nto me!”\n\n“Seek your master, then, in hell!” exclaimed Ravenswood, giving way to\nthe passion he had hitherto restrained, and throwing Craigengelt from\nhim with such violence that he rolled down the steps and lay senseless\nat the foot of them. “I am a fool,” he instantly added, “to vent my\npassion upon a caitiff so worthless.”\n\nHe then mounted his horse, which at his arrival he had secured to a\nbalustrade in front of the castle, rode very slowly past Bucklaw and\nColonel Ashton, raising his hat as he passed each, and looking in their\nfaces steadily while he offered this mute salutation, which was returned\nby both with the same stern gravity. Ravenswood walked on with equal\ndeliberation until he reached the head of the avenue, as if to show\nthat he rather courted than avoided interruption. When he had passed the\nupper gate, he turned his horse, and looked at the castle with a fixed\neye; then set spurs to his good steed, and departed with the speed of a\ndemon dismissed by the exorcist.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\n     Who comes from the bridal chamber?\n     It is Azrael, the angel of death.\n\n     Thalaba.\n\nAFTER the dreadful scene that had taken place at the castle, Lucy was\ntransported to her own chamber, where she remained for some time in a\nstate of absolute stupor. Yet afterwards, in the course of the\nensuing day, she seemed to have recovered, not merely her spirits\nand resolution, but a sort of flighty levity, that was foreign to her\ncharacter and situation, and which was at times chequered by fits of\ndeep silence and melancholy and of capricious pettishness. Lady Ashton\nbecame much alarmed and consulted the family physicians. But as her\npulse indicated no change, they could only say that the disease was on\nthe spirits, and recommended gentle exercise and amusement. Miss Ashton\nnever alluded to what had passed in the state-room. It seemed doubtful\neven if she was conscious of it, for she was often observed to raise\nher hands to her neck, as if in search of the ribbon that had been taken\nfrom it, and mutter, in surprise and discontent, when she could not find\nit, “It was the link that bound me to life.”\n\nNotwithstanding all these remarkable symptoms, Lady Ashton was too\ndeeply pledged to delay her daughter's marriage even in her present\nstate of health. It cost her much trouble to keep up the fair side of\nappearances towards Bucklaw. She was well aware, that if he once saw any\nreluctance on her daughter's part, he would break off the treaty, to her\ngreat personal shame and dishonour. She therefore resolved that, if Lucy\ncontinued passive, the marriage should take place upon the day that had\nbeen previously fixed, trusting that a change of place, of situation,\nand of character would operate a more speedy and effectual cure upon\nthe unsettled spirits of her daughter than could be attained by the slow\nmeasures which the medical men recommended. Sir William Ashton's views\nof family aggrandisement, and his desire to strengthen himself against\nthe measures of the Marquis of A----, readily induced him to acquiesce\nin what he could not have perhaps resisted if willing to do so. As for\nthe young men, Bucklaw and Colonel Ashton, they protested that, after\nwhat had happened, it would be most dishonourable to postpone for\na single hour the time appointed for the marriage, as it would be\ngenerally ascribed to their being intimidated by the intrusive visit and\nthreats of Ravenswood.\n\nBucklaw would indeed have been incapable of such precipitation, had he\nbeen aware of the state of Miss Ashton's health, or rather of her mind.\nBut custom, upon these occasions, permitted only brief and sparing\nintercourse between the bridegroom and the betrothed; a circumstance so\nwell improved by Lady Ashton, that Bucklaw neither saw nor suspected the\nreal state of the health and feelings of his unhappy bride.\n\nOn the eve of the bridal day, Lucy appeared to have one of her fits\nof levity, and surveyed with a degree of girlish interest the various\npreparations of dress, etc., etc., which the different members of the\nfamily had prepared for the occasion.\n\nThe morning dawned bright and cheerily. The bridal guests assembled\nin gallant troops from distant quarters. Not only the relations of Sir\nWilliam Ashton, and the still more dignified connexions of his lady,\ntogether with the numerous kinsmen and allies of the bridegroom, were\npresent upon this joyful ceremony, gallantly mounted, arrayed, and\ncaparisoned, but almost every Presbyterian family of distinction within\nfifty miles made a point of attendance upon an occasion which was\nconsidered as giving a sort of triumph over the Marquis of A----, in the\nperson of his kinsman. Splendid refreshments awaited the guests on their\narrival, and after these were finished, the cry was “To horse.” The\nbride was led forth betwixt her brother Henry and her mother. Her\ngaiety of the preceding day had given rise [place] to a deep shade of\nmelancholy, which, however, did not misbecome an occasion so momentous.\nThere was a light in her eyes and a colour in her cheek which had not\nbeen kindled for many a day, and which, joined to her great beauty, and\nthe splendour of her dress, occasioned her entrance to be greeted with\nan universal murmur of applause, in which even the ladies could not\nrefrain from joining. While the cavalcade were getting to horse, Sir\nWilliam Ashton, a man of peace and of form, censured his son Henry for\nhaving begirt himself with a military sword of preposterous length,\nbelonging to his brother, Colonel Ashton.\n\n“If you must have a weapon,” he said, “upon such a peaceful occasion,\nwhy did you not use the short poniard sent from Edinburgh on purpose?”\n\nThe boy vindicated himself by saying it was lost.\n\n“You put it out of the way yourself, I suppose,” said his father, “out\nof ambition to wear that preposterous thing, which might have served Sir\nWilliam Wallace. But never mind, get to horse now, and take care of your\nsister.”\n\nThe boy did so, and was placed in the centre of the gallant train. At\nthe time, he was too full of his own appearance, his sword, his laced\ncloak, his feathered hat, and his managed horse, to pay much regard to\nanything else; but he afterwards remembered to the hour of his death,\nthat when the hand of his sister, by which she supported herself on\nthe pillion behind him, touched his own, it felt as wet and cold as\nsepulchral marble.\n\nGlancing wide over hill and dale, the fair bridal procession at last\nreached the parish church, which they nearly filled; for, besides\ndomestics, above a hundred gentlemen and ladies were present upon the\noccasion. The marriage ceremony was performed according to the rites\nof the Presbyterian persuasion, to which Bucklaw of late had judged it\nproper to conform.\n\nOn the outside of the church, a liberal dole was distributed to the poor\nof the neighbouring parishes, under the direction of Johnie Mortheuch\n[Mortsheugh], who had lately been promoted from his desolate quarters\nat the Hermitage to fill the more eligible situation of sexton at\nthe parish church of Ravenswood. Dame Gourlay, with two of her\ncontemporaries, the same who assisted at Alice's late-wake, seated apart\nupon a flat monument, or “through-stane,” sate enviously comparing the\nshares which had been allotted to them in dividing the dole.\n\n“Johnie Mortheuch,” said Annie Winnie, “might hae minded auld lang syne,\nand thought of his auld kimmers, for as braw as he is with his new black\ncoat. I hae gotten but five herring instead o' sax, and this disna look\nlike a gude saxpennys, and I dare say this bit morsel o' beef is an unce\nlighter than ony that's been dealt round; and it's a bit o' the tenony\nhough, mair by token that yours, Maggie, is out o' the back-sey.”\n\n“Mine, quo' she!” mumbled the paralytic hag--“mine is half banes,\nI trow. If grit folk gie poor bodies ony thing for coming to their\nweddings and burials, it suld be something that wad do them gude, I\nthink.”\n\n“Their gifts,” said Ailsie Gourlay, “are dealt for nae love of us, nor\nout of respect for whether we feed or starve. They wad gie us whinstanes\nfor loaves, if it would serve their ain vanity, and yet they expect us\nto be as gratefu', as they ca' it, as if they served us for true love\nand liking.”\n\n“And that's truly said,” answered her companion.\n\n“But, Aislie Gourlay, ye're the auldest o' us three--did ye ever see a\nmair grand bridal?”\n\n“I winna say that I have,” answered the hag; “but I think soon to see as\nbraw a burial.”\n\n“And that wad please me as weel,” said Annie Winnie; “for there's\nas large a dole, and folk are no obliged to girn and laugh, and mak\nmurgeons, and wish joy to these hellicat quality, that lord it ower us\nlike brute beasts. I like to pack the dead-dole in my lap and rin ower\nmy auld rhyme--\n\n     My loaf in my lap, my penny in my purse,\n     Thou art ne'er the better, and\n     I'm ne'er the worse.”\n\n“That's right, Annie,” said the paralytic woman; “God send us a green\nYule and a fat kirkyard!”\n\n“But I wad like to ken, Luckie Gourlay, for ye're the auldest and wisest\namang us, whilk o' these revellers' turn it will be to be streikit\nfirst?”\n\n“D'ye see yon dandilly maiden,” said Dame Gourlay, “a' glistenin' wi'\ngowd and jewels, that they are lifting up on the white horse behind that\nhare-brained callant in scarlet, wi' the lang sword at his side?”\n\n“But that's the bride!” said her companion, her cold heart touched with\nsome sort of compassion--“that's the very bride hersell! Eh, whow! sae\nyoung, sae braw, and sae bonny--and is her time sae short?”\n\n“I tell ye,” said the sibyl, “her winding sheet is up as high as her\nthroat already, believe it wha list. Her sand has but few grains to rin\nout; and nae wonder--they've been weel shaken. The leaves are withering\nfast on the trees, but she'll never see the Martinmas wind gar them\ndance in swirls like the fairy rings.” “Ye waited on her for a\nquarter,” said the paralytic woman, “and got twa red pieces, or I am far\nbeguiled?”\n\n“Ay, ay,” answered Ailsie, with a bitter grin; “and Sir William Ashton\npromised me a bonny red gown to the boot o' that--a stake, and a chain,\nand a tar-barrel, lass! what think ye o' that for a propine?--for being\nup early and doun late for fourscore nights and mair wi' his dwining\ndaughter. But he may keep it for his ain leddy, cummers.”\n\n“I hae heard a sough,” said Annie Winnie, “as if Leddy Ashton was nae\ncanny body.”\n\n“D'ye see her yonder,” said Dame Gourlay, “as she prances on her grey\ngelding out at the kirkyard? There's mair o' utter deevilry in that\nwoman, as brave and fair-fashioned as she rides yonder, than in a' the\nScotch withces that ever flew by moonlight ower North Berwick Law.”\n\n“What's that ye say about witches, ye damned hags?” said Johnie\nMortheuch [Mortsheugh]; “are ye casting yer cantrips in the very\nkirkyard, to mischieve the bride and bridegroom? Get awa' hame, for if I\ntak my souple t'ye, I'll gar ye find the road faster than ye wad like.”\n\n“Hegh, sirs!” answered Ailsie Gourlay; “how bra' are we wi' our new\nblack coat and our weel-pouthered head, as if we had never kenn'd hunger\nnor thirst oursells! and we'll be screwing up our bit fiddle, doubtless,\nin the ha' the night, amang a' the other elbo'-jiggers for miles round.\nLet's see if the pins haud, Johnie--that's a', lad.”\n\n“I take ye a' to witness, gude people,” said Morheuch, “that she\nthreatens me wi' mischief, and forespeaks me. If ony thing but gude\nhappens to me or my fiddle this night, I'll make it the blackest night's\njob she ever stirred in. I'll hae her before presbytery and synod: I'm\nhalf a minister mysell, now that I'm a bedral in an inhabited parish.”\n\nAlthough the mutual hatred betwixt these hags and the rest of mankind\nhad steeled their hearts against all impressions of festivity, this was\nby no means the case with the multitude at large. The splendour of the\nbridal retinue, the gay dresses, the spirited horses, the blythesome\nappearance of the handsome women and gallant gentlemen assembled upon\nthe occasion, had the usual effect upon the minds of the populace.\nThe repeated shouts of “Ashton and Bucklaw for ever!” the discharge of\npistols, guns, and musketoons, to give what was called the bridal shot,\nevinced the interest the people took in the occasion of the cavalcade,\nas they accompanied it upon their return to the castle. If there was\nhere and there an elder peasant or his wife who sneered at the pomp\nof the upstart family, and remembered the days of the long-descended\nRavenswoods, even they, attracted by the plentiful cheer which the\ncastle that day afforded to rich and poor, held their way thither,\nand acknowledged, notwithstanding their prejudices, the influence of\nl'Amphitrion ou l'on dine.\n\nThus accompanied with the attendance both of rich and poor, Lucy\nreturned to her father's house. Bucklaw used his privilege of riding\nnext to the bride, but, new to such a situation, rather endeavoured to\nattract attention by the display of his person and horsemanship, than\nby any attempt to address her in private. They reached the castle in\nsafety, amid a thousand joyous acclamations.\n\nIt is well known that the weddings of ancient days were celebrated\nwith a festive publicity rejected by the delicacy of modern times. The\nmarriage guests, on the present occasion, were regaled with a banquet\nof unbounded profusion, the relics of which, after the domestics had\nfeasted in their turn, were distributed among the shouting crowd, with\nas many barrels of ale as made the hilarity without correspond to that\nwithin the castle. The gentlemen, according to the fashion of the times,\nindulged, for the most part, in deep draughts of the richest wines,\nwhile the ladies, prepared for the ball which always closed a bridal\nentertainment, impatiently expected their arrival in the state gallery.\nAt length the social party broke up at a late hour, and the gentlemen\ncrowded into the saloon, where, enlivened by wine and the joyful\noccasion, they laid aside their swords and handed their impatient\npartners to the floor. The music already rung from the gallery, along\nthe fretted roof of the ancient state apartment. According to strict\netiquette, the bride ought to have opened the ball; but Lady Ashton,\nmaking an apology on account of her daughter's health, offered her own\nhand to Bucklaw as substitute for her daughter's. But as Lady Ashton\nraised her head gracefully, expecting the strain at which she was to\nbegin the dance, she was so much struck by an unexpected alteration\nin the ornaments of the apartment that she was surprised into an\nexclamation, “Who has dared to change the pictures?”\n\nAll looked up, and those who knew the usual state of the apartment\nobserved, with surprise, that the picture of Sir William Ashton's father\nwas removed from its place, and in its stead that of old Sir Malise\nRavenswood seemed to frown wrath and vengeance upon the party assembled\nbelow. The exchange must have been made while the apartments were empty,\nbut had not been observed until the torches and lights in the sconces\nwere kindled for the ball. The haughty and heated spirits of the\ngentlemen led them to demand an immediate inquiry into the cause of what\nthey deemed an affront to their host and to themselves; but Lady Ashton,\nrecovering herself, passed it over as the freak of a crazy wench who was\nmaintained about the castle, and whose susceptible imagination had been\nobserved to be much affected by the stories which Dame Gourlay delighted\nto tell concerning “the former family,” so Lady Ashton named the\nRavenswoods. The obnoxious picture was immediately removed, and the ball\nwas opened by Lady Ashton, with a grace and dignity which supplied the\ncharms of youth, and almost verified the extravagant encomiums of the\nelder part of the company, who extolled her performance as far exceeding\nthe dancing of the rising generation.\n\nWhen Lady Ashton sat down, she was not surprised to find that her\ndaughter had left the apartment, and she herself followed, eager to\nobviate any impression which might have been made upon her nerves by an\nincident so likely to affect them as the mysterious transposition of the\nportraits. Apparently she found her apprehensions groundless, for she\nreturned in about an hour, and whispered the bridegroom, who extricated\nhimself from the dancers, and vanished from the apartment. The\ninstruments now played their loudest strains; the dancers pursued their\nexercise with all the enthusiasm inspired by youth, mirth, and high\nspirits, when a cry was heard so shrill and piercing as at once to\narrest the dance and the music. All stood motionless; but when the yell\nwas again repeated, Colonel Ashton snatched a torch from the sconce,\nand demanding the key of the bridal-chamber from Henry, to whom, as\nbride's-man, it had been entrusted, rushed thither, followed by Sir\nWilliam Ashton and Lady Ashton, and one or two others, near relations\nof the family. The bridal guests waited their return in stupified\namazement.\n\nArrived at the door of the apartment, Colonel Ashton knocked and called,\nbut received no answer except stifled groans. He hesitated no longer\nto open the door of the apartment, in which he found opposition from\nsomething which lay against it. When he had succeeded in opening it, the\nbody of the bridegroom was found lying on the threshold of the bridal\nchamber, and all around was flooded with blood. A cry of surprise and\nhorror was raised by all present; and the company, excited by this\nnew alarm, began to rush tumultuously towards the sleeping apartment.\nColonel Ashton, first whispering to his mother, “Search for her; she\nhas murdered him!” drew his sword, planted himself in the passage, and\ndeclared he would suffer no man to pass excepting the clergyman and\na medical person present. By their assistance, Bucklaw, who still\nbreathed, was raised from the ground, and transported to another\napartment, where his friends, full of suspicion and murmuring, assembled\nround him to learn the opinion of the surgeon.\n\nIn the mean while, Lady Ashton, her husband, and their assistants in\nvain sought Lucy in the bridal bed and in the chamber. There was no\nprivate passage from the room, and they began to think that she must\nhave thrown herself from the window, when one of the company, holding\nhis torch lower than the rest, discovered something white in the corner\nof the great old-fashioned chimney of the apartment. Here they found\nthe unfortunate girl seated, or rather couched like a hare upon its\nform--her head-gear dishevelled, her night-clothes torn and dabbled with\nblood, her eyes glazed, and her features convulsed into a wild paroxysm\nof insanity. When she saw herself discovered, she gibbered, made mouths,\nand pointed at them with her bloody fingers, with the frantic gestures\nof an exulting demoniac.\n\nFemale assistance was now hastily summoned; the unhappy bride was\noverpowered, not without the use of some force. As they carried her over\nthe threshold, she looked down, and uttered the only articulate words\nthat she had yet spoken, saying, with a sort of grinning exultation,\n“So, you have ta'en up your bonny bridegroom?” She was, by the\nshuddering assistants, conveyed to another and more retired apartment,\nwhere she was secured as her situation required, and closely watched.\nThe unutterable agony of the parents, the horror and confusion of all\nwho were in the castle, the fury of contending passions between the\nfriends of the different parties--passions augmented by previous\nintemperance--surpass description.\n\nThe surgeon was the first who obtained something like a patient hearing;\nhe pronounced that the wound of Bucklaw, though severe and dangerous,\nwas by no means fatal, but might readily be rendered so by disturbance\nand hasty removal. This silenced the numerous party of Bucklaw's\nfriends, who had previously insisted that he should, at all rates, be\ntransported from the castle to the nearest of their houses. They still\ndemanded, however, that, in consideration of what had happened, four of\ntheir number should remain to watch over the sick-bed of their friend,\nand that a suitable number of their domestics, well armed, should also\nremain in the castle. This condition being acceded to on the part of\nColonel Ashton and his father, the rest of the bridegroom's friends left\nthe castle, notwithstanding the hour and the darkness of the night. The\ncares of the medical man were next employed in behalf of Miss Ashton,\nwhom he pronounced to be in a very dangerous state. Farther medical\nassistance was immediately summoned. All night she remained delirious.\nOn the morning, she fell into a state of absolute insensibility. The\nnext evening, the physicians said, would be the crisis of her malady. It\nproved so; for although she awoke from her trance with some appearance\nof calmness, and suffered her night-clothes to be changed, or put in\norder, yet so soon as she put her hand to her neck, as if to search for\nthe for the fatal flue ribbon, a tide of recollections seemed to rush\nupon her, which her mind and body were alike incapable of bearing.\nConvulsion followed convulsion, till they closed in death, without her\nbeing able to utter a word explanatory of the fatal scene.\n\nThe provincial judge of the district arrived the day after the young\nlady had expired, and executed, though with all possible delicacy to\nthe afflicted family, the painful duty of inquiring into this fatal\ntransaction. But there occurred nothing to explain the general\nhypothesis that the bride, in a sudden fit of insanity, had stabbed the\nbridegroom at the threshold of the apartment. The fatal weapon was found\nin the chamber smeared with blood. It was the same poniard which Henry\nshould have worn on the wedding-day, and the unhappy sister had probably\ncontrived to secrete on the preceding evening, when it had been shown to\nher among other articles of preparation for the wedding.\n\nThe friends of Bucklaw expected that on his recovery he would throw\nsome light upon this dark story, and eagerly pressed him with inquiries,\nwhich for some time he evaded under pretext of weakness. When, however,\nhe had been transported to his own house, and was considered in a state\nof convalescence, he assembled those persons, both male and female, who\nhad considered themselves as entitled to press him on this subject, and\nreturned them thanks for the interest they had exhibited in his behalf,\nand their offers of adherence and support. “I wish you all,” he said,\n“my friends, to understand, however, that I have neither story to tell\nnor injuries to avenge. If a lady shall question me henceforward upon\nthe incident of that unhappy night, I shall remain silent, and in future\nconsider her as one who has shown herself desirous to break of her\nfriendship with me; in a word, I will never speak to her again. But if a\ngentleman shall ask me the same question, I shall regard the incivility\nas equivalent to an invitation to meet him in the Duke's Walk, and I\nexpect that he will rule himself accordingly.”\n\nA declaration so decisive admitted no commentary; and it was soon after\nseen that Bucklaw had arisen from the bed of sickness a sadder and a\nwiser man than he had hitherto shown himself. He dismissed Craigengelt\nfrom his society, but not without such a provision as, if well employed,\nmight secure him against indigence and against temptation. Bucklaw\nafterwards went abroad, and never returned to Scotland; nor was he known\never to hint at the circumstances attending his fatal marriage. By many\nreaders this may be deemed overstrained, romantic, and composed by\nthe wild imagination of an author desirous of gratifying the popular\nappetite for the horrible; but those who are read in the private family\nhistory of Scotland during the period in which the scene is laid, will\nreadily discover, through the disguise of borrowed names and added\nincidents, the leading particulars of AN OWER TRUE TALE.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\n     Whose mind's so marbled, and his heart so hard,\n     That would not, when this huge mishap was heard,\n     To th' utmost note of sorrow set their song,\n     To see a gallant, with so great a grace,\n     So suddenly unthought on, so o'erthrown,\n     And so to perish, in so poor a place,\n     By too rash riding in a ground unknown!\n\n     POEM, IN NISBET'S Heraldry, vol. ii.\n\nWE have anticipated the course of time to mention Bucklaw's recovery and\nfate, that we might not interrupt the detail of events which succeeded\nthe funeral of the unfortunate Lucy Ashton. This melancholy ceremony was\nperformed in the misty dawn of an autumnal morning, with such moderate\nattendance and ceremony as could not possibly be dispensed with. A very\nfew of the nearest relations attended her body to the same churchyard to\nwhich she had so lately been led as a bride, with as little free will,\nperhaps, as could be now testified by her lifeless and passive remains.\nAn aisle adjacent to the church had been fitted up by Sir William Ashton\nas a family cemetery; and here, in a coffin bearing neither name nor\ndate, were consigned to dust the remains of what was once lovely,\nbeautiful, and innocent, though exasperated to frenzy by a long tract of\nunremitting persecution.\n\nWhile the mourners were busy in the vault, the three village hags, who,\nnotwithstanding the unwonted earliness of the hour, had snuffed the\ncarrion like vultures, were seated on the “through-stane,” and engaged\nin their wonted unhallowed conference.\n\n“Did not I say,” said Dame Gourlay, “that the braw bridal would be\nfollowed by as braw a funeral?”\n\n“I think,” answered Dame Winnie, “there's little bravery at it: neither\nmeat nor drink, and just a wheen silver tippences to the poor folk; it\nwas little worth while to come sae far a road for sae sma' profit, and\nus sae frail.”\n\n“Out, wretch!” replied Dame Gourlay, “can a' the dainties they could gie\nus be half sae sweet as this hour's vengeance? There they are that\nwere capering on their prancing nags four days since, and they are now\nganging as dreigh and sober as oursells the day. They were a' glistening\nwi' gowd and silver; they're now as black as the crook. And Miss Lucy\nAshton, that grudged when an honest woman came near her--a taid may sit\non her coffin that day, and she can never scunner when he croaks. And\nLady Ashton has hell-fire burning in her breast by this time; and Sir\nWilliam, wi' his gibbets, and his faggots, and his chains, how likes he\nthe witcheries of his ain dwelling-house?”\n\n“And is it true, then,” mumbled the paralytic wretch, “that the bride\nwas trailed out of her bed and up the chimly by evil spirits, and that\nthe bridegroom's face was wrung round ahint him?”\n\n“Ye needna care wha did it, or how it was done,” said Aislie Gourlay;\n“but I'll uphaud it for nae stickit job, and that the lairds and leddies\nken weel this day.”\n\n“And was it true,” said Annie Winnie, “sin ye ken sae muckle about it,\nthat the picture of auld Sir Malise Ravenswood came down on the ha'\nfloor, and led out the brawl before them a'?”\n\n“Na,” said Ailsie; “but into the ha' came the picture--and I ken weel\nhow it came there--to gie them a warning that pride wad get a fa'. But\nthere's as queer a ploy, cummers, as ony o' thae, that's gaun on even\nnow in the burial vault yonder: ye saw twall mourners, wi' crape and\ncloak, gang down the steps pair and pair!”\n\n“What should ail us to see them?” said the one old woman.\n\n“I counted them,” said the other, with the eagerness of a person to\nwhom the spectacle had afforded too much interest to be viewed with\nindifference.\n\n“But ye did not see,” said Ailsie, exulting in her superior observation,\n“that there's a thirteenth amang them that they ken naething about; and,\nif auld freits say true, there's ane o' that company that'll no be lang\nfor this warld. But come awa' cummers; if we bide here, I'se warrant we\nget the wyte o' whatever ill comes of it, and that gude will come of it\nnane o' them need ever think to see.”\n\nAnd thus, croaking like the ravens when they anticipate pestilence, the\nill-boding sibyls withdrew from the churchyard.\n\nIn fact, the mourners, when the service of interment was ended,\ndiscovered that there was among them one more than the invited number,\nand the remark was communicated in whispers to each other. The suspicion\nfell upon a figure which, muffled in the same deep mourning with the\nothers, was reclined, almost in a state of insensibility, against one of\nthe pillars of the sepulchral vault. The relatives of the Ashton family\nwere expressing in whispers their surprise and displeasure at the\nintrusion, when they were interrupted by Colonel Ashton, who, in his\nfather's absence, acted as principal mourner. “I know,” he said in a\nwhisper, “who this person is, he has, or shall soon have, as deep cause\nof mourning as ourselves; leave me to deal with him, and do not disturb\nthe ceremony by unnecessary exposure.” So saying, he separated himself\nfrom the group of his relations, and taking the unknown mourner by the\ncloak, he said to him, in a tone of suppressed emotion, “Follow me.”\n\nThe stranger, as if starting from a trance at the sound of his voice,\nmechanically obeyed, and they ascended the broken ruinous stair which\nled from the sepulchre into the churchyard. The other mourners followed,\nbut remained grouped together at the door of the vault, watching with\nanxiety the motions of Colonel Ashton and the stranger, who now appeared\nto be in close conference beneath the shade of a yew-tree, in the most\nremote part of the burial-ground.\n\nTo this sequestered spot Colonel Ashton had guided the stranger, and\nthen turning round, addressed him in a stern and composed tone.--“I\ncannot doubt that I speak to the Master of Ravenswood?” No answer was\nreturned. “I cannot doubt,” resumed the Colonel, trembling with rising\npassion, “that I speak to the murderer of my sister!”\n\n“You have named me but too truly,” said Ravenswood, in a hollow and\ntremulous voice.\n\n“If you repent what you have done,” said the Colonel, “may your\npenitence avail you before God; with me it shall serve you nothing.\nHere,” he said, giving a paper, “is the measure of my sword, and a\nmemorandum of the time and place of meeting. Sunrise to-morrow morning,\non the links to the east of Wolf's Hope.”\n\nThe Master of Ravenswood held the paper in his hand, and seemed\nirresolute. At length he spoke--“Do not,” he said, “urge to farther\ndesperation a wretch who is already desperate. Enjoy your life while you\ncan, and let me seek my death from another.”\n\n“That you never, never shall!” said Douglas Ashton. “You shall die by my\nhand, or you shall complete the ruin of my family by taking my life. If\nyou refuse my open challenge, there is no advantage I will not take of\nyou, no indignity with which I will not load you, until the very name of\nRavenswood shall be the sign of everything that is dishonourable, as it\nis already of all that is villainous.”\n\n“That it shall never be,” said Ravenswood, fiercely; “if I am the last\nwho must bear it, I owe it to those who once owned it that the name\nshall be extinguished without infamy. I accept your challenge, time, and\nplace of meeting. We meet, I presume, alone?”\n\n“Alone we meet,” said Colonel Ashton, “and alone will the survivor of us\nreturn from that place of rendezvous.”\n\n“Then God have mercy on the soul of him who falls!” said Ravenswood.\n\n“So be it!” said Colonel Ashton; “so far can my charity reach even for\nthe man I hate most deadly, and with the deepest reason. Now, break off,\nfor we shall be interrupted. The links by the sea-shore to the east of\nWolf's Hope; the hour, sunrise; our swords our only weapons.”\n\n“Enough,” said the Master, “I will not fail you.”\n\nThey separated; Colonel Ashton joining the rest of the mourners, and the\nMaster of Ravenswood taking his horse, which was tied to a tree behind\nthe church. Colonel Ashton returned to the castle with the funeral\nguests, but found a pretext for detaching himself from them in the\nevening, when, changing his dress to a riding-habit, he rode to Wolf's\nHope, that night, and took up his abode in the little inn, in order that\nhe might be ready for his rendezvous in the morning.\n\nIt is not known how the Master of Ravenswood disposed of the rest of\nthat unhappy day. Late at night, however, he arrived at Wolf's Crag, and\naroused his old domestic, Caleb Balderstone, who had ceased to expect\nhis return. Confused and flying rumours of the late tragical death of\nMiss Ashton, and of its mysterious cause, had already reached the old\nman, who was filled with the utmost anxiety, on account of the probable\neffect these events might produce upon the mind of his master.\n\nThe conduct of Ravenswood did not alleviate his apprehensions. To the\nbutler's trembling entreaties that he would take some refreshment, he at\nfirst returned no answer, and then suddenly and fiercely demanding wine,\nhe drank, contrary to his habits, a very large draught. Seeing that his\nmaster would eat nothing, the old man affectionately entreated that\nhe would permit him to light him to his chamber. It was not until the\nrequest was three or four times repeated that Ravenswood made a mute\nsign of compliance. But when Balderstone conducted him to an apartment\nwhich had been comfortably fitted up, and which, since his return, he\nhad usually occupied, Ravenswood stopped short on the threshold.\n\n“Not here,” said he, sternly; “show me the room in which my father died;\nthe room in which SHE slept the night the were at the castle.”\n\n“Who, sir?” said Caleb, too terrified to preserve his presence of mind.\n\n“SHE, Lucy Ashton! Would you kill me, old man, by forcing me to repeat\nher name?”\n\nCaleb would have said something of the disrepair of the chamber, but was\nsilenced by the irritable impatience which was expressed in his master's\ncountenance; he lighted the way trembling and in silence, placed the\nlamp on the table of the deserted room, and was about to attempt some\narrangement of the bed, when his master bid him begone in a tone that\nadmitted of no delay. The old man retired, not to rest, but to prayer;\nand from time to time crept to the door of the apartment, in order to\nfind out whether Ravenswood had gone to repose. His measured heavy step\nupon the floor was only interrupted by deep groans; and the repeated\nstamps of the heel of his heavy boot intimated too clearly that the\nwretched inmate was abandoning himself at such moments to paroxysms of\nuncontrolled agony. The old man thought that the morning, for which he\nlonged, would never have dawned; but time, whose course rolls on with\nequal current, however it may seem more rapid or more slow to mortal\napprehension, brought the dawn at last, and spread a ruddy light on the\nbroad verge of the glistening ocean. It was early in November, and the\nweather was serene for the season of the year. But an easterly wind had\nprevailed during the night, and the advancing tide rolled nearer than\nusual to the foot of the crags on which the castle was founded.\n\nWith the first peep of light, Caleb Balderstone again resorted to the\ndoor of Ravenswood's sleeping apartment, through a chink of which he\nobserved him engaged in measuring the length of two or three swords\nwhich lay in a closet adjoining to the apartment. He muttered to\nhimself, as he selected one of these weapons: “It is shorter: let him\nhave this advantage, as he has every other.”\n\nCaleb Balderstone knew too well, from what he witnessed, upon what\nenterprise his master was bound, and how vain all interference on his\npart must necessarily prove. He had but time to retreat from the\ndoor, so nearly was he surprised by his master suddenly coming out and\ndescending to the stables. The faithful domestic followed; and from the\ndishevelled appearance of his master's dress, and his ghastly looks, was\nconfirmed in his conjecture that he had passed the night without sleep\nor repose. He found him busily engaged in saddling his horse, a service\nfrom which Caleb, though with faltering voice and trembling hands,\noffered to relieve him. Ravenswood rejected his assistance by a mute\nsign, and having led the animal into the court, was just about to mount\nhim, when the old domestic's fear giving way to the strong attachment\nwhich was the principal passion of his mind, he flung himself suddenly\nat Ravenswood's feet, and clasped his knees, while he exclaimed: “Oh,\nsir! oh, master! kill me if you will, but do not go out on this dreadful\nerrand! Oh! my dear master, wait but this day; the Marquis of A----\ncomes to-morrow, and a' will be remedied.”\n\n“You have no longer a master, Caleb,” said Ravenswood, endeavouring to\nextricate himself; “why, old man, would you cling to a falling tower?”\n\n“But I HAVE a master,” cried Caleb, still holding him fast, “while the\nheir of Ravenswood breathes. I am but a servant; but I was born your\nfather's--your grandfather's servant. I was born for the family--I have\nlived for them--I would die for them! Stay but at home, and all will be\nwell!”\n\n“Well, fool! well!” said Ravenswood. “Vain old man, nothing hereafter in\nlife will be well with me, and happiest is the hour that shall soonest\nclose it!”\n\nSo saying, he extricated himself from the old man's hold, threw himself\non his horse, and rode out the gate; but instantly turning back, he\nthrew towards Caleb, who hastened to meet him, a heavy purse of gold.\n\n“Caleb!” he said, with a ghastly smile, “I make you my executor”; and\nagain turning his bridle, he resumed his course down the hill.\n\nThe gold fell unheeded on the pavement, for the old man ran to observe\nthe course which was taken by his master, who turned to the left down a\nsmall and broken path, which gained the sea-shore through a cleft in the\nrock, and led to a sort of cove where, in former times, the boats of\nthe castle were wont to be moored. Observing him take this course, Caleb\nhastened to the eastern battlement, which commanded the prospect of the\nwhole sands, very near as far as the village of Wolf's Hope. He could\neasily see his master riding in that direction, as fast as the horse\ncould carry him. The prophecy at once rushed on Balderstone's mind, that\nthe Lord of Ravenswood should perish on the Kelpie's flow, which\nlay half-way betwixt the Tower and the links, or sand knolls, to the\nnorthward of Wolf's Hope. He saw him according reach the fatal spot; but\nhe never saw him pass further.\n\n\nColonel Ashton, frantic for revenge, was already in the field, pacing\nthe turf with eagerness, and looking with impatience towards the Tower\nfor the arrival of his antagonist. The sun had now risen, and showed its\nbroad disk above the eastern sea, so that he could easily discern the\nhorseman who rode towards him with speed which argued impatience equal\nto his own. At once the figure became invisible, as if it had melted\ninto the air. He rubbed his eyes, as if he had witnessed an apparition,\nand then hastened to the spot, near which he was met by Balderstone,\nwho came from the opposite direction. No trace whatever of horse or rider\ncould be discerned; it only appeared that the late winds and high tides\nhad greatly extended the usual bounds of the quicksand, and that\nthe unfortunate horseman, as appeared from the hoof-tracks, in his\nprecipitate haste, had not attended to keep on the firm sands on the\nfoot of the rock, but had taken the shortest and most dangerous course.\nOne only vestige of his fate appeared. A large sable feather had been\ndetached from his hat, and the rippling waves of the rising tide wafted\nit to Caleb's feet. The old man took it up, dried it, and placed it in\nhis bosom.\n\nThe inhabitants of Wolf's Hope were now alarmed, and crowded to the\nplace, some on shore, and some in boats, but their search availed\nnothing. The tenacious depths of the quicksand, as is usual in such\ncases, retained its prey.\n\n\nOur tale draws to a conclusion. The Marquis of A----, alarmed at the\nfrightful reports that were current, and anxious for his kinsman's\nsafety, arrived on the subsequent day to mourn his loss; and, after\nrenewing in vain a search for the body, returned, to forget what had\nhappened amid the bustle of politics and state affairs.\n\nNot so Caleb Balderstone. If wordly profit could have consoled the old\nman, his age was better provided for than his earlier years had ever\nbeen; but life had lost to him its salt and its savour. His whole course\nof ideas, his feelings, whether of pride or of apprehension, of pleasure\nor of pain, had all arisen from its close connexion with the family\nwhich was now extinguished. He held up his head no longer, forsook all\nhis usual haunts and occupations, and seemed only to find pleasure in\nmoping about those apartments in the old castle which the Master of\nRavenswood had last inhabited. He ate without refreshment, and slumbered\nwithout repose; and, with a fidelity sometimes displayed by the canine\nrace, but seldom by human beings, he pined and died within a year after\nthe catastrophe which we have narrated.\n\n\nThe family of Ashton did not long survive that of Ravenswood. Sir\nWilliam Ashton outlived his eldest son, the Colonel, who was slain in a\nduel in Flanders; and Henry, by whom he was succeeded, died unmarried.\nLady Ashton lived to the verge of extreme old age, the only survivor\nof the group of unhappy persons whose misfortunes were owing to her\nimplacability. That she might internally feel compunction, and reconcile\nherself with Heaven, whom she had offended, we will not, and we dare\nnot, deny; but to those around her she did not evince the slightest\nsymptom either of repentance or remorse. In all external appearance she\nbore the same bold, haughty, unbending character which she had displayed\nbefore these unhappy events. A splendid marble monument records her\nname, titles, and virtues, while her victims remain undistinguished by\ntomb or epitath."
