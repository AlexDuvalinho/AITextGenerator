 "text": "A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST\n\nBy Gene Stratton Porter\n\n\n\n     To All Girls Of The Limberlost\n     In General\n     And One Jeanette Helen Porter\n     In Particular\n\n\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\n  ELNORA, who collects moths to pay for her education, and lives the\n  Golden Rule.\n\n  PHILIP AMMON, who assists in moth hunting, and gains a new conception of\n  love.\n\n  MRS. COMSTOCK, who lost a delusion and found a treasure.\n\n  WESLEY SINTON, who always did his best.\n\n  MARGARET SINTON, who “mothers” Elnora.\n\n  BILLY, a boy from real life.\n\n  EDITH CARR, who discovers herself.\n\n  HART HENDERSON, to whom love means all things.\n\n  POLLY AMMON, who pays an old score.\n\n  TOM LEVERING, engaged to Polly.\n\n  TERENCE O'MORE, Freckles grown tall.\n\n  MRS. O'MORE, who remained the Angel.\n\n  TERENCE, ALICE and LITTLE BROTHER, the O'MORE children.\n\n\n\n\nA GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nWHEREIN ELNORA GOES TO HIGH SCHOOL AND LEARNS MANY LESSONS NOT FOUND IN\nHER BOOKS\n\n\n“Elnora Comstock, have you lost your senses?” demanded the angry voice of\nKatharine Comstock while she glared at her daughter.\n\n“Why mother!” faltered the girl.\n\n“Don't you 'why mother' me!” cried Mrs. Comstock. “You know very well\nwhat I mean. You've given me no peace until you've had your way about\nthis going to school business; I've fixed you good enough, and you're\nready to start. But no child of mine walks the streets of Onabasha\nlooking like a play-actress woman. You wet your hair and comb it down\nmodest and decent and then be off, or you'll have no time to find where\nyou belong.”\n\nElnora gave one despairing glance at the white face, framed in a most\nbecoming riot of reddish-brown hair, which she saw in the little kitchen\nmirror. Then she untied the narrow black ribbon, wet the comb and\nplastered the waving curls close to her head, bound them fast, pinned on\nthe skimpy black hat and opened the back door.\n\n“You've gone so plumb daffy you are forgetting your dinner,” jeered her\nmother.\n\n“I don't want anything to eat,” replied Elnora.\n\n“You'll take your dinner or you'll not go one step. Are you crazy? Walk\nalmost three miles and no food from six in the morning until six at\nnight. A pretty figure you'd cut if you had your way! And after I've\ngone and bought you this nice new pail and filled it especial to start\non!”\n\nElnora came back with a face still whiter and picked up the lunch.\n“Thank you, mother! Good-bye!” she said. Mrs. Comstock did not reply.\nShe watched the girl follow the long walk to the gate and go from sight\non the road, in the bright sunshine of the first Monday of September.\n\n“I bet a dollar she gets enough of it by night!” commented Mrs.\nComstock.\n\nElnora walked by instinct, for her eyes were blinded with tears. She\nleft the road where it turned south, at the corner of the Limberlost,\nclimbed a snake fence and entered a path worn by her own feet. Dodging\nunder willow and scrub oak branches she came at last to the faint\noutline of an old trail made in the days when the precious timber of the\nswamp was guarded by armed men. This path she followed until she reached\na thick clump of bushes. From the debris in the end of a hollow log she\ntook a key that unlocked the padlock of a large weatherbeaten old box,\ninside of which lay several books, a butterfly apparatus, and a small\ncracked mirror. The walls were lined thickly with gaudy butterflies,\ndragonflies, and moths. She set up the mirror and once more pulling\nthe ribbon from her hair, she shook the bright mass over her shoulders,\ntossing it dry in the sunshine. Then she straightened it, bound it\nloosely, and replaced her hat. She tugged vainly at the low brown calico\ncollar and gazed despairingly at the generous length of the narrow\nskirt. She lifted it as she would have cut it if possible. That\ndisclosed the heavy high leather shoes, at sight of which she seemed\npositively ill, and hastily dropped the skirt. She opened the pail,\nremoved the lunch, wrapped it in the napkin, and placed it in a small\npasteboard box. Locking the case again she hid the key and hurried down\nthe trail.\n\nShe followed it around the north end of the swamp and then entered a\nfootpath crossing a farm leading in the direction of the spires of the\ncity to the northeast. Again she climbed a fence and was on the open\nroad. For an instant she leaned against the fence staring before her,\nthen turned and looked back. Behind her lay the land on which she had\nbeen born to drudgery and a mother who made no pretence of loving her;\nbefore her lay the city through whose schools she hoped to find means\nof escape and the way to reach the things for which she cared. When she\nthought of how she appeared she leaned more heavily against the fence\nand groaned; when she thought of turning back and wearing such clothing\nin ignorance all the days of her life she set her teeth firmly and went\nhastily toward Onabasha.\n\nOn the bridge crossing a deep culvert at the suburbs she glanced around,\nand then kneeling she thrust the lunch box between the foundation and\nthe flooring. This left her empty-handed as she approached the big stone\nhigh school building. She entered bravely and inquired her way to the\noffice of the superintendent. There she learned that she should have\ncome the previous week and arranged about her classes. There were many\nthings incident to the opening of school, and one man unable to cope\nwith all of them.\n\n“Where have you been attending school?” he asked, while he advised the\nteacher of Domestic Science not to telephone for groceries until\nshe knew how many she would have in her classes; wrote an order for\nchemicals for the students of science; and advised the leader of the\norchestra to hire a professional to take the place of the bass violist,\nreported suddenly ill.\n\n“I finished last spring at Brushwood school, district number nine,” said\nElnora. “I have been studying all summer. I am quite sure I can do the\nfirst year work, if I have a few days to get started.”\n\n“Of course, of course,” assented the superintendent. “Almost invariably\ncountry pupils do good work. You may enter first year, and if it is too\ndifficult, we will find it out speedily. Your teachers will tell you the\nlist of books you must have, and if you will come with me I will show\nyou the way to the auditorium. It is now time for opening exercises.\nTake any seat you find vacant.”\n\nElnora stood before the entrance and stared into the largest room she\never had seen. The floor sloped to a yawning stage on which a band of\nmusicians, grouped around a grand piano, were tuning their instruments.\nShe had two fleeting impressions. That it was all a mistake; this was\nno school, but a grand display of enormous ribbon bows; and the second,\nthat she was sinking, and had forgotten how to walk. Then a burst from\nthe orchestra nerved her while a bevy of daintily clad, sweet-smelling\nthings that might have been birds, or flowers, or possibly gaily\ndressed, happy young girls, pushed her forward. She found herself\nplodding across the back of the auditorium, praying for guidance, to an\nempty seat.\n\nAs the girls passed her, vacancies seemed to open to meet them. Their\nfriends were moving over, beckoning and whispering invitations. Every\none else was seated, but no one paid any attention to the white-faced\ngirl stumbling half-blindly down the aisle next the farthest wall. So\nshe went on to the very end facing the stage. No one moved, and she\ncould not summon courage to crowd past others to several empty seats she\nsaw. At the end of the aisle she paused in desperation, while she stared\nback at the whole forest of faces most of which were now turned upon\nher.\n\nIn a flash came the full realization of her scanty dress, her pitiful\nlittle hat and ribbon, her big, heavy shoes, her ignorance of where to\ngo or what to do; and from a sickening wave which crept over her, she\nfelt she was going to become very ill. Then out of the mass she saw\na pair of big, brown boy eyes, three seats from her, and there was a\nmessage in them. Without moving his body he reached forward and with a\npencil touched the back of the seat before him. Instantly Elnora took\nanother step which brought her to a row of vacant front seats.\n\nShe heard laughter behind her; the knowledge that she wore the only hat\nin the room burned her; every matter of moment, and some of none at all,\ncut and stung. She had no books. Where should she go when this was over?\nWhat would she give to be on the trail going home! She was shaking with\na nervous chill when the music ceased, and the superintendent arose, and\ncoming down to the front of the flower-decked platform, opened a Bible\nand began to read. Elnora did not know what he was reading, and she\nfelt that she did not care. Wildly she was racking her brain to decide\nwhether she should sit still when the others left the room or follow,\nand ask some one where the Freshmen went first.\n\nIn the midst of the struggle one sentence fell on her ear. “Hide me\nunder the shadow of Thy wings.”\n\nElnora began to pray frantically. “Hide me, O God, hide me, under the\nshadow of Thy wings.”\n\nAgain and again she implored that prayer, and before she realized what\nwas coming, every one had arisen and the room was emptying rapidly.\nElnora hurried after the nearest girl and in the press at the door\ntouched her sleeve timidly.\n\n“Will you please tell me where the Freshmen go?” she asked huskily.\n\nThe girl gave her one surprised glance, and drew away.\n\n“Same place as the fresh women,” she answered, and those nearest her\nlaughed.\n\nElnora stopped praying suddenly and the colour crept into her face.\n“I'll wager you are the first person I meet when I find it,” she said\nand stopped short. “Not that! Oh, I must not do that!” she thought in\ndismay. “Make an enemy the first thing I do. Oh, not that!”\n\nShe followed with her eyes as the young people separated in the hall,\nsome climbing stairs, some disappearing down side halls, some entering\nadjoining doors. She saw the girl overtake the brown-eyed boy and speak\nto him. He glanced back at Elnora with a scowl on his face. Then she\nstood alone in the hall.\n\nPresently a door opened and a young woman came out and entered another\nroom. Elnora waited until she returned, and hurried to her. “Would you\ntell me where the Freshmen are?” she panted.\n\n“Straight down the hall, three doors to your left,” was the answer, as\nthe girl passed.\n\n“One minute please, oh please,” begged Elnora: “Should I knock or just\nopen the door?”\n\n“Go in and take a seat,” replied the teacher.\n\n“What if there aren't any seats?” gasped Elnora.\n\n“Classrooms are never half-filled, there will be plenty,” was the\nanswer.\n\nElnora removed her hat. There was no place to put it, so she carried\nit in her hand. She looked infinitely better without it. After several\nefforts she at last opened the door and stepping inside faced a smaller\nand more concentrated battery of eyes.\n\n“The superintendent sent me. He thinks I belong here,” she said to the\nprofessor in charge of the class, but she never before heard the voice\nwith which she spoke. As she stood waiting, the girl of the hall passed\non her way to the blackboard, and suppressed laughter told Elnora that\nher thrust had been repeated.\n\n“Be seated,” said the professor, and then because he saw Elnora was\ndesperately embarrassed he proceeded to lend her a book and to ask her\nif she had studied algebra. She said she had a little, but not the same\nbook they were using. He asked her if she felt that she could do the\nwork they were beginning, and she said she did.\n\nThat was how it happened, that three minutes after entering the room\nshe was told to take her place beside the girl who had gone last to the\nboard, and whose flushed face and angry eyes avoided meeting Elnora's.\nBeing compelled to concentrate on her proposition she forgot herself.\nWhen the professor asked that all pupils sign their work she firmly\nwrote “Elnora Comstock” under her demonstration. Then she took her seat\nand waited with white lips and trembling limbs, as one after another\nprofessor called the names on the board, while their owners arose and\nexplained their propositions, or “flunked” if they had not found a\ncorrect solution. She was so eager to catch their forms of expression\nand prepare herself for her recitation, that she never looked from the\nwork on the board, until clearly and distinctly, “Elnora Cornstock,”\n called the professor.\n\nThe dazed girl stared at the board. One tiny curl added to the top of\nthe first curve of the m in her name, had transformed it from a good\nold English patronymic that any girl might bear proudly, to Cornstock.\nElnora sat speechless. When and how did it happen? She could feel the\nwave of smothered laughter in the air around her. A rush of anger turned\nher face scarlet and her soul sick. The voice of the professor addressed\nher directly.\n\n“This proposition seems to be beautifully demonstrated, Miss Cornstalk,”\n he said. “Surely, you can tell us how you did it.”\n\nThat word of praise saved her. She could do good work. They might wear\ntheir pretty clothes, have their friends and make life a greater misery\nthan it ever before had been for her, but not one of them should\ndo better work or be more womanly. That lay with her. She was tall,\nstraight, and handsome as she arose.\n\n“Of course I can explain my work,” she said in natural tones. “What I\ncan't explain is how I happened to be so stupid as to make a mistake in\nwriting my own name. I must have been a little nervous. Please excuse\nme.”\n\nShe went to the board, swept off the signature with one stroke, then\nrewrote it plainly. “My name is Comstock,” she said distinctly. She\nreturned to her seat and following the formula used by the others made\nher first high school recitation.\n\nAs Elnora resumed her seat Professor Henley looked at her steadily.\n“It puzzles me,” he said deliberately, “how you can write as beautiful a\ndemonstration, and explain it as clearly as ever has been done in any\nof my classes and still be so disturbed as to make a mistake in your own\nname. Are you very sure you did that yourself, Miss Comstock?”\n\n“It is impossible that any one else should have done it,” answered\nElnora.\n\n“I am very glad you think so,” said the professor. “Being Freshmen, all\nof you are strangers to me. I should dislike to begin the year with you\nfeeling there was one among you small enough to do a trick like that.\nThe next proposition, please.”\n\nWhen the hour had gone the class filed back to the study room and Elnora\nfollowed in desperation, because she did not know where else to go. She\ncould not study as she had no books, and when the class again left the\nroom to go to another professor for the next recitation, she went also.\nAt least they could put her out if she did not belong there. Noon\ncame at last, and she kept with the others until they dispersed on\nthe sidewalk. She was so abnormally self-conscious she fancied all the\nhundreds of that laughing, throng saw and jested at her. When she passed\nthe brown-eyed boy walking with the girl of her encounter, she knew, for\nshe heard him say: “Did you really let that gawky piece of calico get\nahead of you?” The answer was indistinct.\n\nElnora hurried from the city. She intended to get her lunch, eat it in\nthe shade of the first tree, and then decide whether she would go back\nor go home. She knelt on the bridge and reached for her box, but it\nwas so very light that she was prepared for the fact that it was empty,\nbefore opening it. There was one thing for which to be thankful. The boy\nor tramp who had seen her hide it, had left the napkin. She would not\nhave to face her mother and account for its loss. She put it in her\npocket, and threw the box into the ditch. Then she sat on the bridge and\ntried to think, but her brain was confused.\n\n“Perhaps the worst is over,” she said at last. “I will go back. What\nwould mother say to me if I came home now?”\n\nSo she returned to the high school, followed some other pupils to the\ncoat room, hung her hat, and found her way to the study where she had\nbeen in the morning. Twice that afternoon, with aching head and empty\nstomach, she faced strange professors, in different branches. Once she\nescaped notice; the second time the worst happened. She was asked a\nquestion she could not answer.\n\n“Have you not decided on your course, and secured your books?” inquired\nthe professor.\n\n“I have decided on my course,” replied Elnora, “I do not know where to\nask for my books.”\n\n“Ask?” the professor was bewildered.\n\n“I understood the books were furnished,” faltered Elnora.\n\n“Only to those bringing an order from the township trustee,” replied the\nProfessor.\n\n“No! Oh no!” cried Elnora. “I will have them to-morrow,” and gripped\nher desk for support for she knew that was not true. Four books, ranging\nperhaps at a dollar and a half apiece; would her mother buy them? Of\ncourse she would not--could not.\n\nDid not Elnora know the story of old. There was enough land, but no one\nto do clearing and farm. Tax on all those acres, recently the new gravel\nroad tax added, the expense of living and only the work of two women to\nmeet all of it. She was insane to think she could come to the city to\nschool. Her mother had been right. The girl decided that if only she\nlived to reach home, she would stay there and lead any sort of life to\navoid more of this torture. Bad as what she wished to escape had been,\nit was nothing like this. She never could live down the movement that\nwent through the class when she inadvertently revealed the fact that she\nhad expected books to be furnished. Her mother would not secure them;\nthat settled the question.\n\nBut the end of misery is never in a hurry to come; before the day was\nover the superintendent entered the room and explained that pupils from\nthe country were charged a tuition of twenty dollars a year. That\nreally was the end. Previously Elnora had canvassed a dozen methods for\nsecuring the money for books, ranging all the way from offering to wash\nthe superintendent's dishes to breaking into the bank. This additional\nexpense made her plans so wildly impossible, there was nothing to do but\nhold up her head until she was from sight.\n\nDown the long corridor alone among hundreds, down the long street alone\namong thousands, out into the country she came at last. Across the fence\nand field, along the old trail once trodden by a boy's bitter agony, now\nstumbled a white-faced girl, sick at heart. She sat on a log and began\nto sob in spite of her efforts at self-control. At first it was physical\nbreakdown, later, thought came crowding.\n\nOh the shame, the mortification! Why had she not known of the tuition?\nHow did she happen to think that in the city books were furnished?\nPerhaps it was because she had read they were in several states. But why\ndid she not know? Why did not her mother go with her? Other mothers--but\nwhen had her mother ever been or done anything at all like other\nmothers? Because she never had been it was useless to blame her now.\nElnora realized she should have gone to town the week before, called\non some one and learned all these things herself. She should have\nremembered how her clothing would look, before she wore it in public\nplaces. Now she knew, and her dreams were over. She must go home to\nfeed chickens, calves, and pigs, wear calico and coarse shoes, and with\naverted head, pass a library all her life. She sobbed again.\n\n“For pity's sake, honey, what's the matter?” asked the voice of the\nnearest neighbour, Wesley Sinton, as he seated himself beside Elnora.\n“There, there,” he continued, smearing tears all over her face in an\neffort to dry them. “Was it as bad as that, now? Maggie has been just\nwild over you all day. She's got nervouser every minute. She said we\nwere foolish to let you go. She said your clothes were not right, you\nought not to carry that tin pail, and that they would laugh at you. By\ngum, I see they did!”\n\n“Oh, Uncle Wesley,” sobbed the girl, “why didn't she tell me?”\n\n“Well, you see, Elnora, she didn't like to. You got such a way of\nholding up your head, and going through with things. She thought some\nway that you'd make it, till you got started, and then she begun to see\na hundred things we should have done. I reckon you hadn't reached that\nbuilding before she remembered that your skirt should have been pleated\ninstead of gathered, your shoes been low, and lighter for hot September\nweather, and a new hat. Were your clothes right, Elnora?”\n\nThe girl broke into hysterical laughter. “Right!” she cried. “Right!\nUncle Wesley, you should have seen me among them! I was a picture!\nThey'll never forget me. No, they won't get the chance, for they'll see\nme again to-morrow!\n\n“Now that is what I call spunk, Elnora! Downright grit,” said Wesley\nSinton. “Don't you let them laugh you out. You've helped Margaret and me\nfor years at harvest and busy times, what you've earned must amount to\nquite a sum. You can get yourself a good many clothes with it.”\n\n“Don't mention clothes, Uncle Wesley,” sobbed Elnora, “I don't care now\nhow I look. If I don't go back all of them will know it's because I am\nso poor I can't buy my books.”\n\n“Oh, I don't know as you are so dratted poor,” said Sinton meditatively.\n“There are three hundred acres of good land, with fine timber as ever\ngrew on it.”\n\n“It takes all we can earn to pay the tax, and mother wouldn't cut a tree\nfor her life.”\n\n“Well then, maybe, I'll be compelled to cut one for her,” suggested\nSinton. “Anyway, stop tearing yourself to pieces and tell me. If it\nisn't clothes, what is it?”\n\n“It's books and tuition. Over twenty dollars in all.”\n\n“Humph! First time I ever knew you to be stumped by twenty dollars,\nElnora,” said Sinton, patting her hand.\n\n“It's the first time you ever knew me to want money,” answered Elnora.\n“This is different from anything that ever happened to me. Oh, how can I\nget it, Uncle Wesley?”\n\n“Drive to town with me in the morning and I'll draw it from the bank for\nyou. I owe you every cent of it.”\n\n“You know you don't owe me a penny, and I wouldn't touch one from you,\nunless I really could earn it. For anything that's past I owe you and\nAunt Margaret for all the home life and love I've ever known. I know how\nyou work, and I'll not take your money.”\n\n“Just a loan, Elnora, just a loan for a little while until you can earn\nit. You can be proud with all the rest of the world, but there are no\nsecrets between us, are there, Elnora?”\n\n“No,” said Elnora, “there are none. You and Aunt Margaret have given me\nall the love there has been in my life. That is the one reason above all\nothers why you shall not give me charity. Hand me money because you find\nme crying for it! This isn't the first time this old trail has known\ntears and heartache. All of us know that story. Freckles stuck to what\nhe undertook and won out. I stick, too. When Duncan moved away he gave\nme all Freckles left in the swamp, and as I have inherited his property\nmaybe his luck will come with it. I won't touch your money, but I'll\nwin some way. First, I'm going home and try mother. It's just possible\nI could find second-hand books, and perhaps all the tuition need not\nbe paid at once. Maybe they would accept it quarterly. But oh, Uncle\nWesley, you and Aunt Margaret keep on loving me! I'm so lonely, and no\none else cares!”\n\nWesley Sinton's jaws met with a click. He swallowed hard on bitter words\nand changed what he would have liked to say three times before it became\narticulate.\n\n“Elnora,” he said at last, “if it hadn't been for one thing I'd have\ntried to take legal steps to make you ours when you were three years\nold. Maggie said then it wasn't any use, but I've always held on. You\nsee, I was the first man there, honey, and there are things you see,\nthat you can't ever make anybody else understand. She loved him Elnora,\nshe just made an idol of him. There was that oozy green hole, with the\nthick scum broke, and two or three big bubbles slowly rising that were\nthe breath of his body. There she was in spasms of agony, and beside her\nthe great heavy log she'd tried to throw him. I can't ever forgive her\nfor turning against you, and spoiling your childhood as she has, but I\ncouldn't forgive anybody else for abusing her. Maggie has got no mercy\non her, but Maggie didn't see what I did, and I've never tried to make\nit very clear to her. It's been a little too plain for me ever since.\nWhenever I look at your mother's face, I see what she saw, so I hold my\ntongue and say, in my heart, 'Give her a mite more time.' Some day it\nwill come. She does love you, Elnora. Everybody does, honey. It's just\nthat she's feeling so much, she can't express herself. You be a patient\ngirl and wait a little longer. After all, she's your mother, and you're\nall she's got, but a memory, and it might do her good to let her know\nthat she was fooled in that.”\n\n“It would kill her!” cried the girl swiftly. “Uncle Wesley, it would\nkill her! What do you mean?”\n\n“Nothing,” said Wesley Sinton soothingly. “Nothing, honey. That was just\none of them fool things a man says, when he is trying his best to be\nwise. You see, she loved him mightily, and they'd been married only a\nyear, and what she was loving was what she thought he was. She hadn't\nreally got acquainted with the man yet. If it had been even one more\nyear, she could have borne it, and you'd have got justice. Having been a\nteacher she was better educated and smarter than the rest of us, and\nso she was more sensitive like. She can't understand she was loving a\ndream. So I say it might do her good if somebody that knew, could tell\nher, but I swear to gracious, I never could. I've heard her out at the\nedge of that quagmire calling in them wild spells of hers off and on for\nthe last sixteen years, and imploring the swamp to give him back to her,\nand I've got out of bed when I was pretty tired, and come down to see\nshe didn't go in herself, or harm you. What she feels is too deep for\nme. I've got to respectin' her grief, and I can't get over it. Go home\nand tell your ma, honey, and ask her nice and kind to help you. If she\nwon't, then you got to swallow that little lump of pride in your neck,\nand come to Aunt Maggie, like you been a-coming all your life.”\n\n“I'll ask mother, but I can't take your money, Uncle Wesley, indeed I\ncan't. I'll wait a year, and earn some, and enter next year.”\n\n“There's one thing you don't consider, Elnora,” said the man earnestly.\n“And that's what you are to Maggie. She's a little like your ma. She\nhasn't given up to it, and she's struggling on brave, but when we buried\nour second little girl the light went out of Maggie's eyes, and it's\nnot come back. The only time I ever see a hint of it is when she thinks\nshe's done something that makes you happy, Elnora. Now, you go easy\nabout refusing her anything she wants to do for you. There's times in\nthis world when it's our bounden duty to forget ourselves, and think\nwhat will help other people. Young woman, you owe me and Maggie all the\ncomfort we can get out of you. There's the two of our own we can't ever\ndo anything for. Don't you get the idea into your head that a fool thing\nyou call pride is going to cut us out of all the pleasure we have in\nlife beside ourselves.”\n\n“Uncle Wesley, you are a dear,” said Elnora. “Just a dear! If I can't\npossibly get that money any way else on earth, I'll come and borrow it\nof you, and then I'll pay it back if I must dig ferns from the swamp and\nsell them from door to door in the city. I'll even plant them, so that\nthey will be sure to come up in the spring. I have been sort of panic\nstricken all day and couldn't think. I can gather nuts and sell them.\nFreckles sold moths and butterflies, and I've a lot collected. Of\ncourse, I am going back to-morrow! I can find a way to get the books.\nDon't you worry about me. I am all right!\n\n“Now, what do you think of that?” inquired Wesley Sinton of the swamp in\ngeneral. “Here's our Elnora come back to stay. Head high and right as a\ntrivet! You've named three ways in three minutes that you could earn\nten dollars, which I figure would be enough, to start you. Let's go to\nsupper and stop worrying!”\n\nElnora unlocked the case, took out the pail, put the napkin in it,\npulled the ribbon from her hair, binding it down tightly again and\nfollowed to the road. From afar she could see her mother in the doorway.\nShe blinked her eyes, and tried to smile as she answered Wesley Sinton,\nand indeed she did feel better. She knew now what she had to expect,\nwhere to go, and what to do. Get the books she must; when she had them,\nshe would show those city girls and boys how to prepare and recite\nlessons, how to walk with a brave heart; and they could show her how to\nwear pretty clothes and have good times.\n\nAs she neared the door her mother reached for the pail. “I forgot to\ntell you to bring home your scraps for the chickens,” she said.\n\nElnora entered. “There weren't any scraps, and I'm hungry again as I\never was in my life.”\n\n“I thought likely you would be,” said Mrs. Comstock, “and so I got\nsupper ready. We can eat first, and do the work afterward. What kept you\nso? I expected you an hour ago.”\n\nElnora looked into her mother's face and smiled. It was a queer sort\nof a little smile, and would have reached the depths with any normal\nmother.\n\n“I see you've been bawling,” said Mrs. Comstock. “I thought you'd get\nyour fill in a hurry. That's why I wouldn't go to any expense. If we\nkeep out of the poor-house we have to cut the corners close. It's likely\nthis Brushwood road tax will eat up all we've saved in years. Where the\nland tax is to come from I don't know. It gets bigger every year. If\nthey are going to dredge the swamp ditch again they'll just have to take\nthe land to pay for it. I can't, that's all! We'll get up early in the\nmorning and gather and hull the beans for winter, and put in the rest of\nthe day hoeing the turnips.”\n\nElnora again smiled that pitiful smile.\n\n“Do you think I didn't know that I was funny and would be laughed at?”\n she asked.\n\n“Funny?” cried Mrs. Comstock hotly.\n\n“Yes, funny! A regular caricature,” answered Elnora. “No one else wore\ncalico, not even one other. No one else wore high heavy shoes, not even\none. No one else had such a funny little old hat; my hair was not right,\nmy ribbon invisible compared with the others, I did not know where\nto go, or what to do, and I had no books. What a spectacle I made for\nthem!” Elnora laughed nervously at her own picture. “But there are\nalways two sides! The professor said in the algebra class that he never\nhad a better solution and explanation than mine of the proposition he\ngave me, which scored one for me in spite of my clothes.”\n\n“Well, I wouldn't brag on myself!”\n\n“That was poor taste,” admitted Elnora. “But, you see, it is a case of\nwhistling to keep up my courage. I honestly could see that I would have\nlooked just as well as the rest of them if I had been dressed as they\nwere. We can't afford that, so I have to find something else to brace\nme. It was rather bad, mother!”\n\n“Well, I'm glad you got enough of it!”\n\n“Oh, but I haven't,” hurried in Elnora. “I just got a start. The hardest\nis over. To-morrow they won't be surprised. They will know what\nto expect. I am sorry to hear about the dredge. Is it really going\nthrough?”\n\n“Yes. I got my notification today. The tax will be something enormous.\nI don't know as I can spare you, even if you are willing to be a\nlaughing-stock for the town.”\n\nWith every bite Elnora's courage returned, for she was a healthy young\nthing.\n\n“You've heard about doing evil that good might come from it,” she said.\n“Well, mother mine, it's something like that with me. I'm willing to\nbear the hard part to pay for what I'll learn. Already I have selected\nthe ward building in which I shall teach in about four years. I am going\nto ask for a room with a south exposure so that the flowers and moths I\ntake in from the swamp to show the children will do well.”\n\n“You little idiot!” said Mrs. Comstock. “How are you going to pay your\nexpenses?”\n\n“Now that is just what I was going to ask you!” said Elnora. “You see,\nI have had two startling pieces of news to-day. I did not know I would\nneed any money. I thought the city furnished the books, and there is an\nout-of-town tuition, also. I need ten dollars in the morning. Will you\nplease let me have it?”\n\n“Ten dollars!” cried Mrs. Comstock. “Ten dollars! Why don't you say a\nhundred and be done with it! I could get one as easy as the other. I\ntold you! I told you I couldn't raise a cent. Every year expenses grow\nbigger and bigger. I told you not to ask for money!”\n\n“I never meant to,” replied Elnora. “I thought clothes were all I needed\nand I could bear them. I never knew about buying books and tuition.”\n\n“Well, I did!” said Mrs. Comstock. “I knew what you would run into! But\nyou are so bull-dog stubborn, and so set in your way, I thought I would\njust let you try the world a little and see how you liked it!”\n\nElnora pushed back her chair and looked at her mother.\n\n“Do you mean to say,” she demanded, “that you knew, when you let me\ngo into a city classroom and reveal the fact before all of them that I\nexpected to have my books handed out to me; do you mean to say that you\nknew I had to pay for them?”\n\nMrs. Comstock evaded the direct question.\n\n“Anybody but an idiot mooning over a book or wasting time prowling\nthe woods would have known you had to pay. Everybody has to pay for\neverything. Life is made up of pay, pay, pay! It's always and forever\npay! If you don't pay one way you do another! Of course, I knew you had\nto pay. Of course, I knew you would come home blubbering! But you don't\nget a penny! I haven't one cent, and can't get one! Have your way if you\nare determined, but I think you will find the road somewhat rocky.”\n\n“Swampy, you mean, mother,” corrected Elnora. She arose white and\ntrembling. “Perhaps some day God will teach me how to understand you. He\nknows I do not now. You can't possibly realize just what you let me\ngo through to-day, or how you let me go, but I'll tell you this: You\nunderstand enough that if you had the money, and would offer it to me,\nI wouldn't touch it now. And I'll tell you this much more. I'll get\nit myself. I'll raise it, and do it some honest way. I am going back\nto-morrow, the next day, and the next. You need not come out, I'll do\nthe night work, and hoe the turnips.”\n\nIt was ten o'clock when the chickens, pigs, and cattle were fed, the\nturnips hoed, and a heap of bean vines was stacked beside the back door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nWHEREIN WESLEY AND MARGARET GO SHOPPING, AND ELNORA'S WARDROBE IS\nREPLENISHED\n\n\nWesley Sinton walked down the road half a mile and turned at the lane\nleading to his home. His heart was hot and filled with indignation. He\nhad told Elnora he did not blame her mother, but he did. His wife met\nhim at the door.\n\n“Did you see anything of Elnora?” she questioned.\n\n“Most too much, Maggie,” he answered. “What do you say to going to town?\nThere's a few things has to be got right away.”\n\n“Where did you see her, Wesley?”\n\n“Along the old Limberlost trail, my girl, torn to pieces sobbing. Her\ncourage always has been fine, but the thing she met to-day was too much\nfor her. We ought to have known better than to let her go that way. It\nwasn't only clothes; there were books, and entrance fees for out-of-town\npeople, that she didn't know about; while there must have been jeers,\nwhispers, and laughing. Maggie, I feel as if I'd been a traitor to\nthose girls of ours. I ought to have gone in and seen about this school\nbusiness. Don't cry, Maggie. Get me some supper, and I'll hitch up and\nsee what we can do now.”\n\n“What can we do, Wesley?\n\n“I don't just know. But we've got to do something. Kate Comstock will be\na handful, while Elnora will be two, but between us we must see that the\ngirl is not too hard pressed about money, and that she is dressed so she\nis not ridiculous. She's saved us the wages of a woman many a day, can't\nyou make her some decent dresses?”\n\n“Well, I'm not just what you call expert, but I could beat Kate Comstock\nall to pieces. I know that skirts should be pleated to the band instead\nof gathered, and full enough to sit in, and short enough to walk in. I\ncould try. There are patterns for sale. Let's go right away, Wesley.”\n\n“Set me a bit of supper, while I hitch up.”\n\nMargaret built a fire, made coffee, and fried ham and eggs. She set out\npie and cake and had enough for a hungry man by the time the carriage\nwas at the door, but she had no appetite. She dressed while Wesley ate,\nput away the food while he dressed, and then they drove toward the city\nthrough the beautiful September evening, and as they went they planned\nfor Elnora. The trouble was, not whether they were generous enough to\nbuy what she needed, but whether she would accept their purchases, and\nwhat her mother would say.\n\nThey went to a drygoods store and when a clerk asked what they wanted\nto see neither of them knew, so they stepped aside and held a whispered\nconsultation.\n\n“What had we better get, Wesley?”\n\n“Dresses,” said Wesley promptly,\n\n“But how many dresses, and what kind?”\n\n“Blest if I know!” exclaimed Wesley. “I thought you would manage that. I\nknow about some things I'm going to get.”\n\nAt that instant several high school girls came into the store and\napproached them.\n\n“There!” exclaimed Wesley breathlessly. “There, Maggie! Like them!\nThat's what she needs! Buy like they have!”\n\nMargaret stared. What did they wear? They were rapidly passing; they\nseemed to have so much, and she could not decide so quickly. Before she\nknew it she was among them.\n\n“I beg your pardon, but won't you wait one minute?” she asked.\n\nThe girls stopped with wondering faces.\n\n“It's your clothes,” explained Mrs. Sinton. “You look just beautiful to\nme. You look exactly as I should have wanted to see my girls. They both\ndied of diphtheria when they were little, but they had yellow hair, dark\neyes and pink cheeks, and everybody thought they were lovely. If they\nhad lived, they'd been near your age now, and I'd want them to look like\nyou.”\n\nThere was sympathy on every girl face.\n\n“Why thank you!” said one of them. “We are very sorry for you.”\n\n“Of course you are,” said Margaret. “Everybody always has been. And\nbecause I can't ever have the joy of a mother in thinking for my girls\nand buying pretty things for them, there is nothing left for me, but to\ndo what I can for some one who has no mother to care for her. I know a\ngirl, who would be just as pretty as any of you, if she had the clothes,\nbut her mother does not think about her, so I mother her some myself.”\n\n“She must be a lucky girl,” said another.\n\n“Oh, she loves me,” said Margaret, “and I love her. I want her to look\njust like you do. Please tell me about your clothes. Are these the\ndresses and hats you wear to school? What kind of goods are they, and\nwhere do you buy them?”\n\nThe girls began to laugh and cluster around Margaret. Wesley strode down\nthe store with his head high through pride in her, but his heart\nwas sore over the memory of two little faces under Brushwood sod. He\ninquired his way to the shoe department.\n\n“Why, every one of us have on gingham or linen dresses,” they said, “and\nthey are our school clothes.”\n\nFor a few moments there was a babel of laughing voices explaining to the\ndelighted Margaret that school dresses should be bright and pretty, but\nsimple and plain, and until cold weather they should wash.\n\n“I'll tell you,” said Ellen Brownlee, “my father owns this store, I know\nall the clerks. I'll take you to Miss Hartley. You tell her just how\nmuch you want to spend, and what you want to buy, and she will know how\nto get the most for your money. I've heard papa say she was the best\nclerk in the store for people who didn't know precisely what they\nwanted.”\n\n“That's the very thing,” agreed Margaret. “But before you go, tell me\nabout your hair. Elnora's hair is bright and wavy, but yours is silky as\nhackled flax. How do you do it?”\n\n“Elnora?” asked four girls in concert.\n\n“Yes, Elnora is the name of the girl I want these things for.”\n\n“Did she come to the high school to-day?” questioned one of them.\n\n“Was she in your classes?” demanded Margaret without reply.\n\nFour girls stood silent and thought fast. Had there been a strange girl\namong them, and had she been overlooked and passed by with indifference,\nbecause she was so very shabby? If she had appeared as much better than\nthey, as she had looked worse, would her reception have been the same?\n\n“There was a strange girl from the country in the Freshman class\nto-day,” said Ellen Brownlee, “and her name was Elnora.”\n\n“That was the girl,” said Margaret.\n\n“Are her people so very poor?” questioned Ellen.\n\n“No, not poor at all, come to think of it,” answered Margaret. “It's a\npeculiar case. Mrs. Comstock had a great trouble and she let it change\nher whole life and make a different woman of her. She used to be lovely;\nnow she is forever saving and scared to death for fear they will go\nto the poorhouse; but there is a big farm, covered with lots of good\ntimber. The taxes are high for women who can't manage to clear and work\nthe land. There ought to be enough to keep two of them in good shape all\ntheir lives, if they only knew how to do it. But no one ever told Kate\nComstock anything, and never will, for she won't listen. All she does\nis droop all day, and walk the edge of the swamp half the night, and\nneglect Elnora. If you girls would make life just a little easier for\nher it would be the finest thing you ever did.”\n\nAll of them promised they would.\n\n“Now tell me about your hair,” persisted Margaret Sinton.\n\nSo they took her to a toilet counter, and she bought the proper hair\nsoap, also a nail file, and cold cream, for use after windy days. Then\nthey left her with the experienced clerk, and when at last Wesley found\nher she was loaded with bundles and the light of other days was in her\nbeautiful eyes. Wesley also carried some packages.\n\n“Did you get any stockings?” he whispered.\n\n“No, I didn't,” she said. “I was so interested in dresses and hair\nribbons and a--a hat----” she hesitated and glanced at Wesley. “Of\ncourse, a hat!” prompted Wesley. “That I forgot all about those horrible\nshoes. She's got to have decent shoes, Wesley.”\n\n“Sure!” said Wesley. “She's got decent shoes. But the man said some\nbrown stockings ought to go with them. Take a peep, will you!”\n\nWesley opened a box and displayed a pair of thick-soled, beautifully\nshaped brown walking shoes of low cut. Margaret cried out with pleasure.\n\n“But do you suppose they are the right size, Wesley? What did you get?”\n\n“I just said for a girl of sixteen with a slender foot.”\n\n“Well, that's about as near as I could come. If they don't fit when\nshe tries them, we will drive straight in and change them. Come on now,\nlet's get home.”\n\nAll the way they discussed how they should give Elnora their purchases\nand what Mrs. Comstock would say.\n\n“I am afraid she will be awful mad,” said Margaret.\n\n“She'll just rip!” replied Wesley graphically. “But if she wants\nto leave the raising of her girl to the neighbours, she needn't get\nfractious if they take some pride in doing a good job. From now on I\ncalculate Elnora shall go to school; and she shall have all the clothes\nand books she needs, if I go around on the back of Kate Comstock's land\nand cut a tree, or drive off a calf to pay for them. Why I know one tree\nshe owns that would put Elnora in heaven for a year. Just think of it,\nMargaret! It's not fair. One-third of what is there belongs to Elnora\nby law, and if Kate Comstock raises a row I'll tell her so, and see that\nthe girl gets it. You go to see Kate in the morning, and I'll go with\nyou. Tell her you want Elnora's pattern, that you are going to make her\na dress, for helping us. And sort of hint at a few more things. If Kate\nbalks, I'll take a hand and settle her. I'll go to law for Elnora's\nshare of that land and sell enough to educate her.”\n\n“Why, Wesley Sinton, you're perfectly wild.”\n\n“I'm not! Did you ever stop to think that such cases are so frequent\nthere have been laws made to provide for them? I can bring it up in\ncourt and force Kate to educate Elnora, and board and clothe her till\nshe's of age, and then she can take her share.”\n\n“Wesley, Kate would go crazy!”\n\n“She's crazy now. The idea of any mother living with as sweet a girl as\nElnora and letting her suffer till I find her crying like a funeral.\nIt makes me fighting mad. All uncalled for. Not a grain of sense in it.\nI've offered and offered to oversee clearing her land and working her\nfields. Let her sell a good tree, or a few acres. Something is going to\nbe done, right now. Elnora's been fairly happy up to this, but to spoil\nthe school life she's planned, is to ruin all her life. I won't have it!\nIf Elnora won't take these things, so help me, I'll tell her what she is\nworth, and loan her the money and she can pay me back when she comes of\nage. I am going to have it out with Kate Comstock in the morning. Here\nwe are! You open up what you got while I put away the horses, and then\nI'll show you.”\n\nWhen Wesley came from the barn Margaret had four pieces of crisp\ngingham, a pale blue, a pink, a gray with green stripes and a rich brown\nand blue plaid. On each of them lay a yard and a half of wide ribbon to\nmatch. There were handkerchiefs and a brown leather belt. In her hands\nshe held a wide-brimmed tan straw hat, having a high crown banded with\nvelvet strips each of which fastened with a tiny gold buckle.\n\n“It looks kind of bare now,” she explained. “It had three quills on it\nhere.”\n\n“Did you have them taken off?” asked Wesley.\n\n“Yes, I did. The price was two and a half for the hat, and those things\nwere a dollar and a half apiece. I couldn't pay that.”\n\n“It does seem considerable,” admitted Wesley, “but will it look right\nwithout them?”\n\n“No, it won't!” said Margaret. “It's going to have quills on it. Do you\nremember those beautiful peacock wing feathers that Phoebe Simms gave\nme? Three of them go on just where those came off, and nobody will ever\nknow the difference. They match the hat to a moral, and they are just\na little longer and richer than the ones that I had taken off. I was\nwondering whether I better sew them on to-night while I remember how\nthey set, or wait till morning.”\n\n“Don't risk it!” exclaimed Wesley anxiously. “Don't you risk it! Sew\nthem on right now!”\n\n“Open your bundles, while I get the thread,” said Margaret.\n\nWesley unwrapped the shoes. Margaret took them up and pinched the\nleather and stroked them.\n\n“My, but they are fine!” she cried.\n\nWesley picked up one and slowly turned it in his big hands. He glanced\nat his foot and back to the shoe.\n\n“It's a little bit of a thing, Margaret,” he said softly. “Like as not\nI'll have to take it back. It seems as if it couldn't fit.”\n\n“It seems as if it didn't dare do anything else,” said Margaret. “That's\na happy little shoe to get the chance to carry as fine a girl as Elnora\nto high school. Now what's in the other box?”\n\nWesley looked at Margaret doubtfully.\n\n“Why,” he said, “you know there's going to be rainy days, and those\nthings she has now ain't fit for anything but to drive up the cows----”\n\n“Wesley, did you get high shoes, too?”\n\n“Well, she ought to have them! The man said he would make them cheaper\nif I took both pairs at once.”\n\nMargaret laughed aloud. “Those will do her past Christmas,” she exulted.\n“What else did you buy?”\n\n“Well sir,” said Wesley, “I saw something to-day. You told me about Kate\ngetting that tin pail for Elnora to carry to high school and you said\nyou told her it was a shame. I guess Elnora was ashamed all right, for\nto-night she stopped at the old case Duncan gave her, and took out that\npail, where it had been all day, and put a napkin inside it. Coming home\nshe confessed she was half starved because she hid her dinner under a\nculvert, and a tramp took it. She hadn't had a bite to eat the whole\nday. But she never complained at all, she was pleased that she hadn't\nlost the napkin. So I just inquired around till I found this, and I\nthink it's about the ticket.”\n\nWesley opened the package and laid a brown leather lunch box on the\ntable. “Might be a couple of books, or drawing tools or most anything\nthat's neat and genteel. You see, it opens this way.”\n\nIt did open, and inside was a space for sandwiches, a little porcelain\nbox for cold meat or fried chicken, another for salad, a glass with a\nlid which screwed on, held by a ring in a corner, for custard or jelly,\na flask for tea or milk, a beautiful little knife, fork, and spoon\nfastened in holders, and a place for a napkin.\n\nMargaret was almost crying over it.\n\n“How I'd love to fill it!” she exclaimed.\n\n“Do it the first time, just to show Kate Comstock what love is!” said\nWesley. “Get up early in the morning and make one of those dresses\nto-morrow. Can't you make a plain gingham dress in a day? I'll pick a\nchicken, and you fry it and fix a little custard for the cup, and do it\nup brown. Go on, Maggie, you do it!”\n\n“I never can,” said Margaret. “I am slow as the itch about sewing, and\nthese are not going to be plain dresses when it comes to making them.\nThere are going to be edgings of plain green, pink, and brown to the\nbias strips, and tucks and pleats around the hips, fancy belts and\ncollars, and all of it takes time.”\n\n“Then Kate Comstock's got to help,” said Wesley. “Can the two of you\nmake one, and get that lunch to-morrow?”\n\n“Easy, but she'll never do it!”\n\n“You see if she doesn't!” said Wesley. “You get up and cut it out, and\nsoon as Elnora is gone I'll go after Kate myself. She'll take what I'll\nsay better alone. But she'll come, and she'll help make the dress. These\nother things are our Christmas gifts to Elnora. She'll no doubt need\nthem more now than she will then, and we can give them just as well.\nThat's yours, and this is mine, or whichever way you choose.”\n\nWesley untied a good brown umbrella and shook out the folds of a long,\nbrown raincoat. Margaret dropped the hat, arose and took the coat. She\ntried it on, felt it, cooed over it and matched it with the umbrella.\n\n“Did it look anything like rain to-night?” she inquired so anxiously\nthat Wesley laughed.\n\n“And this last bundle?” she said, dropping back in her chair, the coat\nstill over her shoulders.\n\n“I couldn't buy this much stuff for any other woman and nothing for my\nown,” said Wesley. “It's Christmas for you, too, Margaret!” He shook out\nfold after fold of soft gray satiny goods that would look lovely against\nMargaret's pink cheeks and whitening hair.\n\n“Oh, you old darling!” she exclaimed, and fled sobbing into his arms.\n\nBut she soon dried her eyes, raked together the coals in the cooking\nstove and boiled one of the dress patterns in salt water for half an\nhour. Wesley held the lamp while she hung the goods on the line to dry.\nThen she set the irons on the stove so they would be hot the first thing\nin the morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nWHEREIN ELNORA VISITS THE BIRD WOMAN, AND OPENS A BANK ACCOUNT\n\n\nFour o'clock the following morning Elnora was shelling beans. At six she\nfed the chickens and pigs, swept two of the rooms of the cabin, built a\nfire, and put on the kettle for breakfast. Then she climbed the narrow\nstairs to the attic she had occupied since a very small child, and\ndressed in the hated shoes and brown calico, plastered down her crisp\ncurls, ate what breakfast she could, and pinning on her hat started for\ntown.\n\n“There is no sense in your going for an hour yet,” said her mother.\n\n“I must try to discover some way to earn those books,” replied Elnora.\n“I am perfectly positive I shall not find them lying beside the road\nwrapped in tissue paper, and tagged with my name.”\n\nShe went toward the city as on yesterday. Her perplexity as to where\ntuition and books were to come from was worse but she did not feel quite\nso badly. She never again would have to face all of it for the first\ntime. There had been times yesterday when she had prayed to be hidden,\nor to drop dead, and neither had happened. “I believe the best way to\nget an answer to prayer is to work for it,” muttered Elnora grimly.\n\nAgain she followed the trail to the swamp, rearranged her hair and left\nthe tin pail. This time she folded a couple of sandwiches in the napkin,\nand tied them in a neat light paper parcel which she carried in\nher hand. Then she hurried along the road to Onabasha and found a\nbook-store. There she asked the prices of the list of books that she\nneeded, and learned that six dollars would not quite supply them. She\nanxiously inquired for second-hand books, but was told that the only way\nto secure them was from the last year's Freshmen. Just then Elnora felt\nthat she positively could not approach any of those she supposed to be\nSophomores and ask to buy their old books. The only balm the girl could\nsee for the humiliation of yesterday was to appear that day with a set\nof new books.\n\n“Do you wish these?” asked the clerk hurriedly, for the store was\nrapidly filling with school children wanting anything from a dictionary\nto a pen.\n\n“Yes,” gasped Elnora, “Oh, yes! But I cannot pay for them just now.\nPlease let me take them, and I will pay for them on Friday, or return\nthem as perfect as they are. Please trust me for them a few days.”\n\n“I'll ask the proprietor,” he said. When he came back Elnora knew the\nanswer before he spoke.\n\n“I'm sorry,” he said, “but Mr. Hann doesn't recognize your name. You are\nnot a customer of ours, and he feels that he can't take the risk.”\n\nElnora clumped out of the store, the thump of her heavy, shoes beating\nas a hammer on her brain. She tried two other dealers with the same\nresult, and then in sick despair came into the street. What could she\ndo? She was too frightened to think. Should she stay from school that\nday and canvass the homes appearing to belong to the wealthy, and try\nto sell beds of wild ferns, as she had suggested to Wesley Sinton? What\nwould she dare ask for bringing in and planting a clump of ferns? How\ncould she carry them? Would people buy them? She slowly moved past the\nhotel and then glanced around to see if there were a clock anywhere, for\nshe felt sure the young people passing her constantly were on their way\nto school.\n\nThere it stood in a bank window in big black letters staring straight at\nher:\n\n\nWANTED: CATERPILLARS, COCOONS, CHRYSALIDES, PUPAE CASES, BUTTERFLIES,\nMOTHS, INDIAN RELICS OF ALL KINDS. HIGHEST SCALE OF PRICES PAID IN CASH\n\n\nElnora caught the wicket at the cashier's desk with both hands to brace\nherself against disappointment.\n\n“Who is it wants to buy cocoons, butterflies, and moths?” she panted.\n\n“The Bird Woman,” answered the cashier. “Have you some for sale?”\n\n“I have some, I do not know if they are what she would want.”\n\n“Well, you had better see her,” said the cashier. “Do you know where she\nlives?”\n\n“Yes,” said Elnora. “Would you tell me the time?”\n\n“Twenty-one after eight,” was the answer.\n\nShe had nine minutes to reach the auditorium or be late. Should she\ngo to school, or to the Bird Woman? Several girls passed her walking\nswiftly and she remembered their faces. They were hurrying to school.\nElnora caught the infection. She would see the Bird Woman at noon.\nAlgebra came first, and that professor was kind. Perhaps she could slip\nto the superintendent and ask him for a book for the next lesson, and at\nnoon--“Oh, dear Lord make it come true,” prayed Elnora, at noon possibly\nshe could sell some of those wonderful shining-winged things she had\nbeen collecting all her life around the outskirts of the Limberlost.\n\nAs she went down the long hall she noticed the professor of mathematics\nstanding in the door of his recitation room. When she passed him he\nsmiled and spoke to her.\n\n“I have been watching for you,” he said, and Elnora stopped bewildered.\n\n“For me?” she questioned.\n\n“Yes,” said Professor Henley. “Step inside.”\n\nElnora followed him into the room and closed the door behind them.\n\n“At teachers' meeting last evening, one of the professors mentioned\nthat a pupil had betrayed in class that she had expected her books to be\nfurnished by the city. I thought possibly it was you. Was it?”\n\n“Yes,” breathed Elnora.\n\n“That being the case,” said Professor Henley, “it just occurred to me as\nyou had expected that, you might require a little time to secure\nthem, and you are too fine a mathematician to fall behind for want of\nsupplies. So I telephoned one of our Sophomores to bring her last year's\nbooks this morning. I am sorry to say they are somewhat abused, but the\ntext is all here. You can have them for two dollars, and pay when you\nare ready. Would you care to take them?”\n\nElnora sat suddenly, because she could not stand another instant. She\nreached both hands for the books, and said never a word. The professor\nwas silent also. At last Eleanor arose, hugging those books to her heart\nas a mother clasps a baby.\n\n“One thing more,” said the professor. “You may pay your tuition\nquarterly. You need not bother about the first instalment this month.\nAny time in October will do.”\n\nIt seemed as if Elnora's gasp of relief must have reached the soles of\nher brogans.\n\n“Did any one ever tell you how beautiful you are!” she cried.\n\nAs the professor was lank, tow-haired and so near-sighted, that he\npeered at his pupils through spectacles, no one ever had.\n\n“No,” said Professor Henley, “I've waited some time for that; for which\nreason I shall appreciate it all the more. Come now, or we shall be late\nfor opening exercises.”\n\nSo Elnora entered the auditorium a second time. Her face was like the\nbrightest dawn that ever broke over the Limberlost. No matter about the\nlumbering shoes and skimpy dress. No matter about anything, she had the\nbooks. She could take them home. In her garret she could commit them to\nmemory, if need be. She could prove that clothes were not all. If the\nBird Woman did not want any of the many different kinds of specimens she\nhad collected, she was quite sure now she could sell ferns, nuts, and a\ngreat many things. Then, too, a girl made a place for her that morning,\nand several smiled and bowed. Elnora forgot everything save her books,\nand that she was where she could use them intelligently--everything\nexcept one little thing away back in her head. Her mother had known\nabout the books and the tuition, and had not told her when she agreed to\nher coming.\n\nAt noon Elnora took her little parcel of lunch and started to the home\nof the Bird Woman. She must know about the specimens first and then she\nwould walk to the suburbs somewhere and eat a few bites. She dropped\nthe heavy iron knocker on the door of a big red log cabin, and her heart\nthumped at the resounding stroke.\n\n“Is the Bird Woman at home?” she asked of the maid.\n\n“She is at lunch,” was the answer.\n\n“Please ask her if she will see a girl from the Limberlost about some\nmoths?” inquired Elnora.\n\n“I never need ask, if it's moths,” laughed the girl. “Orders are to\nbring any one with specimens right in. Come this way.”\n\nElnora followed down the hall and entered a long room with high panelled\nwainscoting, old English fireplace with an overmantel and closets of\npeculiar china filling the corners. At a bare table of oak, yellow as\ngold, sat a woman Elnora often had watched and followed covertly around\nthe Limberlost. The Bird Woman was holding out a hand of welcome.\n\n“I heard!” she laughed. “A little pasteboard box, or just the mere\nword 'specimen,' passes you at my door. If it is moths I hope you have\nhundreds. I've been very busy all summer and unable to collect, and I\nneed so many. Sit down and lunch with me, while we talk it over. From\nthe Limberlost, did you say?”\n\n“I live near the swamp,” replied Elnora. “Since it's so cleared I dare\ngo around the edge in daytime, though we are all afraid at night.”\n\n“What have you collected?” asked the Bird Woman, as she helped Elnora to\nsandwiches unlike any she ever before had tasted, salad that seemed to\nbe made of many familiar things, and a cup of hot chocolate that would\nhave delighted any hungry schoolgirl.\n\n“I am afraid I am bothering you for nothing, and imposing on you,” she\nsaid. “That 'collected' frightens me. I've only gathered. I always loved\neverything outdoors, so I made friends and playmates of them. When I\nlearned that the moths die so soon, I saved them especially, because\nthere seemed no wickedness in it.”\n\n“I have thought the same thing,” said the Bird Woman encouragingly. Then\nbecause the girl could not eat until she learned about the moths, the\nBird Woman asked Elnora if she knew what kinds she had.\n\n“Not all of them,” answered Elnora. “Before Mr. Duncan moved away he\noften saw me near the edge of the swamp and he showed me the box he\nhad fixed for Freckles, and gave me the key. There were some books and\nthings, so from that time on I studied and tried to take moths right,\nbut I am afraid they are not what you want.”\n\n“Are they the big ones that fly mostly in June nights?” asked the Bird\nWoman.\n\n“Yes,” said Elnora. “Big gray ones with reddish markings, pale\nblue-green, yellow with lavender, and red and yellow.”\n\n“What do you mean by 'red and yellow?'” asked the Bird Woman so quickly\nthat the girl almost jumped.\n\n“Not exactly red,” explained Elnora, with tremulous voice. “A reddish,\nyellowish brown, with canary-coloured spots and gray lines on their\nwings.”\n\n“How many of them?” It was the same quick question.\n\n“I had over two hundred eggs,” said Elnora, “but some of them didn't\nhatch, and some of the caterpillars died, but there must be at least a\nhundred perfect ones.”\n\n“Perfect! How perfect?” cried the Bird Woman.\n\n“I mean whole wings, no down gone, and all their legs and antennae,”\n faltered Elnora.\n\n“Young woman, that's the rarest moth in America,” said the Bird Woman\nsolemnly. “If you have a hundred of them, they are worth a hundred\ndollars according to my list. I can use all that are not damaged.”\n\n“What if they are not pinned right,” quavered Elnora.\n\n“If they are perfect, that does not make the slightest difference. I\nknow how to soften them so that I can put them into any shape I choose.\nWhere are they? When may I see them?”\n\n“They are in Freckles's old case in the Limberlost,” said Elnora. “I\ncouldn't carry many for fear of breaking them, but I could bring a few\nafter school.”\n\n“You come here at four,” said the Bird Woman, “and we will drive out\nwith some specimen boxes, and a price list, and see what you have to\nsell. Are they your very own? Are you free to part with them?”\n\n“They are mine,” said Elnora. “No one but God knows I have them. Mr.\nDuncan gave me the books and the box. He told Freckles about me, and\nFreckles told him to give me all he left. He said for me to stick to the\nswamp and be brave, and my hour would come, and it has! I know most of\nthem are all right, and oh, I do need the money!”\n\n“Could you tell me?” asked the Bird Woman softly.\n\n“You see the swamp and all the fields around it are so full,” explained\nElnora. “Every day I felt smaller and smaller, and I wanted to know more\nand more, and pretty soon I grew desperate, just as Freckles did. But\nI am better off than he was, for I have his books, and I have a mother;\neven if she doesn't care for me as other girls' mothers do for them,\nit's better than no one.”\n\nThe Bird Woman's glance fell, for the girl was not conscious of how much\nshe was revealing. Her eyes were fixed on a black pitcher filled\nwith goldenrod in the centre of the table and she was saying what she\nthought.\n\n“As long as I could go to the Brushwood school I was happy, but I\ncouldn't go further just when things were the most interesting, so I was\ndetermined I'd come to high school and mother wouldn't consent. You see\nthere's plenty of land, but father was drowned when I was a baby, and\nmother and I can't make money as men do. The taxes are higher every\nyear, and she said it was too expensive. I wouldn't give her any rest,\nuntil at last she bought me this dress, and these shoes and I came. It\nwas awful!”\n\n“Do you live in that beautiful cabin at the northwest end of the swamp?”\n asked the Bird Woman.\n\n“Yes,” said Elnora.\n\n“I remember the place and a story about it, now. You entered the high\nschool yesterday?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“It was rather bad?”\n\n“Rather bad!” echoed Elnora.\n\nThe Bird Woman laughed.\n\n“You can't tell me anything about that,” she said. “I once entered a\ncity school straight from the country. My dress was brown calico, and my\nshoes were heavy.”\n\nThe tears began to roll down Elnora's cheeks.\n\n“Did they----?” she faltered.\n\n“They did!” said the Bird Woman. “All of it. I am sure they did not miss\none least little thing.”\n\nThen she wiped away some tears that began coursing her cheeks, and\nlaughed at the same time.\n\n“Where are they now?” asked Elnora suddenly.\n\n“They are widely scattered, but none of them have attained heights out\nof range. Some of the rich are poor, and some of the poor are rich. Some\nof the brightest died insane, and some of the dullest worked out\nhigh positions; some of the very worst to bear have gone out, and I\nfrequently hear from others. Now I am here, able to remember it, and\nmingle laughter with what used to be all tears; for every day I have my\nbeautiful work, and almost every day God sends some one like you to help\nme. What is your name, my girl?”\n\n“Elnora Comstock,” answered Elnora. “Yesterday on the board it changed\nto Cornstock, and for a minute I thought I'd die, but I can laugh over\nthat already.”\n\nThe Bird Woman arose and kissed her. “Finish your lunch,” she said, “and\nI will bring my price lists, and make a memorandum of what you think you\nhave, so I will know how many boxes to prepare. And remember this: What\nyou are lies with you. If you are lazy, and accept your lot, you may\nlive in it. If you are willing to work, you can write your name anywhere\nyou choose, among the only ones who live beyond the grave in this\nworld, the people who write books that help, make exquisite music, carve\nstatues, paint pictures, and work for others. Never mind the calico\ndress, and the coarse shoes. Work at your books, and before long you\nwill hear yesterday's tormentors boasting that they were once classmates\nof yours. 'I could a tale unfold'----!”\n\nShe laughingly left the room and Elnora sat thinking, until she\nremembered how hungry she was, so she ate the food, drank the hot\nchocolate and began to feel better.\n\nThen the Bird Woman came back and showed Elnora a long printed\nslip giving a list of graduated prices for moths, butterflies, and\ndragonflies.\n\n“Oh, do you want them!” exulted Elnora. “I have a few and I can get more\nby the thousand, with every colour in the world on their wings.”\n\n“Yes,” said the Bird Woman, “I will buy them, also the big moth\ncaterpillars that are creeping everywhere now, and the cocoons that they\nwill spin just about this time. I have a sneaking impression that the\nmystery, wonder, and the urge of their pure beauty, are going to force\nme to picture and paint our moths and put them into a book for all the\nworld to see and know. We Limberlost people must not be selfish with\nthe wonders God has given to us. We must share with those poor cooped-up\ncity people the best we can. To send them a beautiful book, that is the\nway, is it not, little new friend of mine?”\n\n“Yes, oh yes!” cried Elnora. “And please God they find a way to earn the\nmoney to buy the books, as I have those I need so badly.”\n\n“I will pay good prices for all the moths you can find,” said the Bird\nWoman, “because you see I exchange them with foreign collectors. I\nwant a complete series of the moths of America to trade with a German\nscientist, another with a man in India, and another in Brazil. Others I\ncan exchange with home collectors for those of California and Canada, so\nyou see I can use all you can raise, or find. The banker will buy stone\naxes, arrow points, and Indian pipes. There was a teacher from the city\ngrade schools here to-day for specimens. There is a fund to supply the\nward buildings. I'll help you get in touch with that. They want leaves\nof different trees, flowers, grasses, moths, insects, birds' nests and\nanything about birds.”\n\nElnora's eyes were blazing. “Had I better go back to school or open a\nbank account and begin being a millionaire? Uncle Wesley and I have a\nbushel of arrow points gathered, a stack of axes, pipes, skin-dressing\ntools, tubes and mortars. I don't know how I ever shall wait three\nhours.”\n\n“You must go, or you will be late,” said the Bird Woman. “I will be\nready at four.”\n\nAfter school closed Elnora, seated beside the Bird Woman, drove to\nFreckles's room in the Limberlost. One at a time the beautiful big moths\nwere taken from the interior of the old black case. Not a fourth of them\ncould be moved that night and it was almost dark when the last box was\nclosed, the list figured, and into Elnora's trembling fingers were paid\nfifty-nine dollars and sixteen cents. Elnora clasped the money closely.\n\n“Oh you beautiful stuff!” she cried. “You are going to buy the books,\npay the tuition, and take me to high school.”\n\nThen because she was a woman, she sat on a log and looked at her shoes.\nLong after the Bird Woman drove away Elnora remained. She had her\nproblem, and it was a big one. If she told her mother, would she take\nthe money to pay the taxes? If she did not tell her, how could she\naccount for the books, and things for which she would spend it. At last\nshe counted out what she needed for the next day, placed the remainder\nin the farthest corner of the case, and locked the door. She then filled\nthe front of her skirt from a heap of arrow points beneath the case and\nstarted home.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nWHEREIN THE SINTONS ARE DISAPPOINTED, AND MRS. COMSTOCK LEARNS THAT SHE\nCAN LAUGH\n\n\nWith the first streak of red above the Limberlost Margaret Sinton was\nbusy with the gingham and the intricate paper pattern she had purchased.\nWesley cooked the breakfast and worked until he thought Elnora would be\ngone, then he started to bring her mother.\n\n“Now you be mighty careful,” cautioned Margaret. “I don't know how she\nwill take it.”\n\n“I don't either,” said Wesley philosophically, “but she's got to take it\nsome way. That dress has to be finished by school time in the morning.”\n\nWesley had not slept well that night. He had been so busy framing\ndiplomatic speeches to make to Mrs. Comstock that sleep had little\nchance with him. Every step nearer to her he approached his position\nseemed less enviable. By the time he reached the front gate and started\ndown the walk between the rows of asters and lady slippers he was\nperspiring, and every plausible and convincing speech had fled his\nbrain. Mrs. Comstock helped him. She met him at the door.\n\n“Good morning,” she said. “Did Margaret send you for something?”\n\n“Yes,” said Wesley. “She's got a job that's too big for her, and she\nwants you to help.”\n\n“Of course I will,” said Mrs. Comstock. It was no one's affair how\nlonely the previous day had been, or how the endless hours of the\npresent would drag. “What is she doing in such a rush?”\n\nNow was his chance.\n\n“She's making a dress for Elnora,” answered, Wesley. He saw Mrs.\nComstock's form straighten, and her face harden, so he continued\nhastily. “You see Elnora has been helping us at harvest time,\nbutchering, and with unexpected visitors for years. We've made out that\nshe's saved us a considerable sum, and as she wouldn't ever touch any\npay for anything, we just went to town and got a few clothes we thought\nwould fix her up a little for the high school. We want to get a dress\ndone to-day mighty bad, but Margaret is slow about sewing, and she never\ncan finish alone, so I came after you.”\n\n“And it's such a simple little matter, so dead easy; and all so between\nold friends like, that you can't look above your boots while you explain\nit,” sneered Mrs. Comstock. “Wesley Sinton, what put the idea into your\nhead that Elnora would take things bought with money, when she wouldn't\ntake the money?”\n\nThen Sinton's eyes came up straightly.\n\n“Finding her on the trail last night sobbing as hard as I ever saw any\none at a funeral. She wasn't complaining at all, but she's come to me\nall her life with her little hurts, and she couldn't hide how she'd been\nlaughed at, twitted, and run face to face against the fact that there\nwere books and tuition, unexpected, and nothing will ever make me\nbelieve you didn't know that, Kate Comstock.”\n\n“If any doubts are troubling you on that subject, sure I knew it! She\nwas so anxious to try the world, I thought I'd just let her take a few\nknocks and see how she liked them.”\n\n“As if she'd ever taken anything but knocks all her life!” cried Wesley\nSinton. “Kate Comstock, you are a heartless, selfish woman. You've never\nshown Elnora any real love in her life. If ever she finds out that thing\nyou'll lose her, and it will serve you right.”\n\n“She knows it now,” said Mrs. Comstock icily, “and she'll be home\nto-night just as usual.”\n\n“Well, you are a brave woman if you dared put a girl of Elnora's make\nthrough what she suffered yesterday, and will suffer again to-day,\nand let her know you did it on purpose. I admire your nerve. But I've\nwatched this since Elnora was born, and I got enough. Things have come\nto a pass where they go better for her, or I interfere.”\n\n“As if you'd ever done anything but interfere all her life! Think I\nhaven't watched you? Think I, with my heart raw in my breast, and too\nnumb to resent it openly, haven't seen you and Mag Sinton trying to turn\nElnora against me day after day? When did you ever tell her what her\nfather meant to me? When did you ever try to make her see the wreck of\nmy life, and what I've suffered? No indeed! Always it's been poor little\nabused Elnora, and cakes, kissing, extra clothes, and encouraging her\nto run to you with a pitiful mouth every time I tried to make a woman of\nher.”\n\n“Kate Comstock, that's unjust,” cried Sinton. “Only last night I tried\nto show her the picture I saw the day she was born. I begged her to come\nto you and tell you pleasant what she needed, and ask you for what I\nhappen to know you can well afford to give her.”\n\n“I can't!” cried Mrs. Comstock. “You know I can't!”\n\n“Then get so you can!” said Wesley Sinton. “Any day you say the word you\ncan sell six thousand worth of rare timber off this place easy. I'll\nsee to clearing and working the fields cheap as dirt, for Elnora's\nsake. I'll buy you more cattle to fatten. All you've got to do is sign\na lease, to pull thousands from the ground in oil, as the rest of us are\ndoing all around you!”\n\n“Cut down Robert's trees!” shrieked Mrs. Comstock. “Tear up his land!\nCover everything with horrid, greasy oil! I'll die first.”\n\n“You mean you'll let Elnora go like a beggar, and hurt and mortify her\npast bearing. I've got to the place where I tell you plain what I am\ngoing to do. Maggie and I went to town last night, and we bought what\nthings Elnora needs most urgent to make her look a little like the rest\nof the high school girls. Now here it is in plain English. You can help\nget these things ready, and let us give them to her as we want----”\n\n“She won't touch them!” cried Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“Then you can pay us, and she can take them as her right----”\n\n“I won't!”\n\n“Then I will tell Elnora just what you are worth, what you can afford,\nand how much of this she owns. I'll loan her the money to buy books and\ndecent clothes, and when she is of age she can sell her share and pay\nme.”\n\nMrs. Comstock gripped a chair-back and opened her lips, but no words\ncame.\n\n“And,” Sinton continued, “if she is so much like you that she won't do\nthat, I'll go to the county seat and lay complaint against you as her\nguardian before the judge. I'll swear to what you are worth, and how you\nare raising her, and have you discharged, or have the judge appoint some\nman who will see that she is comfortable, educated, and decent looking!”\n\n“You--you wouldn't!” gasped Kate Comstock.\n\n“I won't need to, Kate!” said Sinton, his heart softening the instant\nthe hard words were said. “You won't show it, but you do love Elnora!\nYou can't help it! You must see how she needs things; come help us fix\nthem, and be friends. Maggie and I couldn't live without her, and you\ncouldn't either. You've got to love such a fine girl as she is; let it\nshow a little!”\n\n“You can hardly expect me to love her,” said Mrs. Comstock coldly. “But\nfor her a man would stand back of me now, who would beat the breath out\nof your sneaking body for the cowardly thing with which you threaten me.\nAfter all I've suffered you'd drag me to court and compel me to tear up\nRobert's property. If I ever go they carry me. If they touch one tree,\nor put down one greasy old oil well, it will be over all I can shoot,\nbefore they begin. Now, see how quick you can clear out of here!”\n\n“You won't come and help Maggie with the dress?”\n\nFor answer Mrs. Comstock looked around swiftly for some object on which\nto lay her hands. Knowing her temper, Wesley Sinton left with all the\nhaste consistent with dignity. But he did not go home. He crossed a\nfield, and in an hour brought another neighbour who was skilful with her\nneedle. With sinking heart Margaret saw them coming.\n\n“Kate is too busy to help to-day, she can't sew before to-morrow,” said\nWesley cheerfully as they entered.\n\nThat quieted Margaret's apprehension a little, though she had some\ndoubts. Wesley prepared the lunch, and by four o'clock the dress was\nfinished as far as it possibly could be until it was fitted on Elnora.\nIf that did not entail too much work, it could be completed in two\nhours.\n\nThen Margaret packed their purchases into the big market basket. Wesley\ntook the hat, umbrella, and raincoat, and they went to Mrs. Comstock's.\nAs they reached the step, Margaret spoke pleasantly to Mrs. Comstock,\nwho sat reading just inside the door, but she did not answer and\ndeliberately turned a leaf without looking up.\n\nWesley Sinton opened the door and went in followed by Margaret.\n\n“Kate,” he said, “you needn't take out your mad over our little racket\non Maggie. I ain't told her a word I said to you, or you said to me.\nShe's not so very strong, and she's sewed since four o'clock this\nmorning to get this dress ready for to-morrow. It's done and we came\ndown to try it on Elnora.”\n\n“Is that the truth, Mag Sinton?” demanded Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“You heard Wesley say so,” proudly affirmed Mrs. Sinton.\n\n“I want to make you a proposition,” said Wesley. “Wait till Elnora\ncomes. Then we'll show her the things and see what she says.”\n\n“How would it do to see what she says without bribing her,” sneered Mrs.\nComstock.\n\n“If she can stand what she did yesterday, and will to-day, she can bear\n'most anything,” said Wesley. “Put away the clothes if you want to, till\nwe tell her.”\n\n“Well, you don't take this waist I'm working on,” said Margaret, “for\nI have to baste in the sleeves and set the collar. Put the rest out of\nsight if you like.”\n\nMrs. Comstock picked up the basket and bundles, placed them inside her\nroom and closed the door.\n\nMargaret threaded her needle and began to sew. Mrs. Comstock returned\nto her book, while Wesley fidgeted and raged inwardly. He could see\nthat Margaret was nervous and almost in tears, but the lines in Mrs.\nComstock's impassive face were set and cold. So they sat while the\nclock ticked off the time--one hour, two, dusk, and no Elnora. Just when\nMargaret and Wesley were discussing whether he had not better go to town\nto meet Elnora, they heard her coming up the walk. Wesley dropped his\ntilted chair and squared himself. Margaret gripped her sewing, and\nturned pleading eyes toward the door. Mrs. Comstock closed her book and\ngrimly smiled.\n\n“Mother, please open the door,” called Elnora.\n\nMrs. Comstock arose, and swung back the screen. Elnora stepped in beside\nher, bent half double, the whole front of her dress gathered into a sort\nof bag filled with a heavy load, and one arm stacked high with books. In\nthe dim light she did not see the Sintons.\n\n“Please hand me the empty bucket in the kitchen, mother,” she said. “I\njust had to bring these arrow points home, but I'm scared for fear I've\nspoiled my dress and will have to wash it. I'm to clean them, and take\nthem to the banker in the morning, and oh, mother, I've sold enough\nstuff to pay for my books, my tuition, and maybe a dress and some\nlighter shoes besides. Oh, mother I'm so happy! Take the books and bring\nthe bucket!”\n\nThen she saw Margaret and Wesley. “Oh, glory!” she exulted. “I was just\nwondering how I'd ever wait to tell you, and here you are! It's too\nperfectly splendid to be true!”\n\n“Tell us, Elnora,” said Sinton.\n\n“Well sir,” said Elnora, doubling down on the floor and spreading out\nher skirt, “set the bucket here, mother. These points are brittle, and\nshould be put in one at a time. If they are chipped I can't sell them.\nWell sir! I've had a time! You know I just had to have books. I tried\nthree stores, and they wouldn't trust me, not even three days, I didn't\nknow what in this world I could do quickly enough. Just when I was\nalmost frantic I saw a sign in a bank window asking for caterpillars,\ncocoons, butterflies, arrow points, and everything. I went in, and it\nwas this Bird Woman who wants the insects, and the banker wants the\nstones. I had to go to school then, but, if you'll believe it”--Elnora\nbeamed on all of them in turn as she talked and slipped the arrow\npoints from her dress to the pail--“if you'll believe it--but you won't,\nhardly, until you look at the books--there was the mathematics teacher,\nwaiting at his door, and he had a set of books for me that he had\ntelephoned a Sophomore to bring.”\n\n“How did he happen to do that, Elnora?” interrupted Sinton.\n\nElnora blushed.\n\n“It was a fool mistake I made yesterday in thinking books were just\nhanded out to one. There was a teachers' meeting last night and the\nhistory teacher told about that. Professor Henley thought of me. You\nknow I told you what he said about my algebra, mother. Ain't I glad I\nstudied out some of it myself this summer! So he telephoned and a girl\nbrought the books. Because they are marked and abused some I get the\nwhole outfit for two dollars. I can erase most of the marks, paste down\nthe covers, and fix them so they look better. But I must hurry to the\njoy part. I didn't stop to eat, at noon, I just ran to the Bird Woman's,\nand I had lunch with her. It was salad, hot chocolate, and lovely\nthings, and she wants to buy most every old scrap I ever gathered. She\nwants dragonflies, moths, butterflies, and he--the banker, I mean--wants\neverything Indian. This very night she came to the swamp with me and\ntook away enough stuff to pay for the books and tuition, and to-morrow\nshe is going to buy some more.”\n\nElnora laid the last arrow point in the pail and arose, shaking leaves\nand bits of baked earth from her dress. She reached into her pocket,\nproduced her money and waved it before their wondering eyes.\n\n“And that's the joy part!” she exulted. “Put it up in the clock till\nmorning, mother. That pays for the books and tuition and--” Elnora\nhesitated, for she saw the nervous grasp with which her mother's fingers\nclosed on the bills. Then she continued, but more slowly and thinking\nbefore she spoke.\n\n“What I get to-morrow pays for more books and tuition, and maybe a few,\njust a few, things to wear. These shoes are so dreadfully heavy and\nhot, and they make such a noise on the floor. There isn't another calico\ndress in the whole building, not among hundreds of us. Why, what is\nthat? Aunt Margaret, what are you hiding in your lap?”\n\nShe snatched the waist and shook it out, and her face was beaming. “Have\nyou taken to waists all fancy and buttoned in the back? I bet you this\nis mine!”\n\n“I bet you so too,” said Margaret Sinton. “You undress right away and\ntry it on, and if it fits, it will be done for morning. There are some\nlow shoes, too!”\n\nElnora began to dance. “Oh, you dear people!” she cried. “I can pay for\nthem to-morrow night! Isn't it too splendid! I was just thinking on the\nway home that I certainly would be compelled to have cooler shoes until\nlater, and I was wondering what I'd do when the fall rains begin.”\n\n“I meant to get you some heavy dress skirts and a coat then,” said Mrs.\nComstock.\n\n“I know you said so!” cried Elnora. “But you needn't, now! I can buy\nevery single stitch I need myself. Next summer I can gather up a lot\nmore stuff, and all winter on the way to school. I am sure I can sell\nferns, I know I can nuts, and the Bird Woman says the grade rooms want\nleaves, grasses, birds' nests, and cocoons. Oh, isn't this world lovely!\nI'll be helping with the tax, next, mother!”\n\nElnora waved the waist and started for the bedroom. When she opened the\ndoor she gave a little cry.\n\n“What have you people been doing?” she demanded. “I never saw so many\ninteresting bundles in all my life. I'm 'skeered' to death for fear I\ncan't pay for them, and will have to give up something.”\n\n“Wouldn't you take them, if you could not pay for them, Elnora?” asked\nher mother instantly.\n\n“Why, not unless you did,” answered Elnora. “People have no right to\nwear things they can't afford, have they?”\n\n“But from such old friends as Maggie and Wesley!” Mrs. Comstock's voice\nwas oily with triumph.\n\n“From them least of all,” cried Elnora stoutly. “From a stranger sooner\nthan from them, to whom I owe so much more than I ever can pay now.”\n\n“Well, you don't have to,” said Mrs. Comstock. “Maggie just selected\nthese things, because she is more in touch with the world, and has got\nsuch good taste. You can pay as long as your money holds out, and if\nthere's more necessary, maybe I can sell the butcher a calf, or if\nthings are too costly for us, of course, they can take them back. Put on\nthe waist now, and then you can look over the rest and see if they are\nsuitable, and what you want.”\n\nElnora stepped into the adjoining room and closed the door. Mrs.\nComstock picked up the bucket and started for the well with it. At the\nbedroom she paused.\n\n“Elnora, were you going to wash these arrow points?”\n\n“Yes. The Bird Woman says they sell better if they are clean, so it can\nbe seen that there are no defects in them.”\n\n“Of course,” said Mrs. Comstock. “Some of them seem quite baked. Shall I\nput them to soak? Do you want to take them in the morning?”\n\n“Yes, I do,” answered Elnora. “If you would just fill the pail with\nwater.”\n\nMrs. Comstock left the room. Wesley Sinton sat with his back to the\nwindow in the west end of the cabin which overlooked the well. A\nsuppressed sound behind him caused him to turn quickly. Then he arose\nand leaned over Margaret.\n\n“She's out there laughing like a blamed monkey!” he whispered\nindignantly.\n\n“Well, she can't help it!” exclaimed Margaret.\n\n“I'm going home!” said Wesley.\n\n“Oh no, you are not!” retorted Margaret. “You are missing the point.\nThe point is not how you look, or feel. It is to get these things in\nElnora's possession past dispute. You go now, and to-morrow Elnora will\nwear calico, and Kate Comstock will return these goods. Right here I\nstay until everything we bought is Elnora's.”\n\n“What are you going to do?” asked Wesley.\n\n“I don't know yet, myself,” said Margaret.\n\nThen she arose and peered from the window. At the well curb stood\nKatharine Comstock. The strain of the day was finding reaction. Her chin\nwas in the air, she was heaving, shaking and strangling to suppress\nany sound. The word that slipped between Margaret Sinton's lips shocked\nWesley until he dropped on his chair, and recalled her to her senses.\nShe was fairly composed as she turned to Elnora, and began the fitting.\nWhen she had pinched, pulled, and patted she called, “Come see if you\nthink this fits, Kate.”\n\nMrs. Comstock had gone around to the back door and answered from the\nkitchen. “You know more about it than I do. Go ahead! I'm getting\nsupper. Don't forget to allow for what it will shrink in washing!”\n\n“I set the colours and washed the goods last night; it can be made to\nfit right now,” answered Margaret.\n\nWhen she could find nothing more to alter she told Elnora to heat some\nwater. After she had done that the girl began opening packages.\n\nThe hat came first.\n\n“Mother!” cried Elnora. “Mother, of course, you have seen this, but you\nhaven't seen it on me. I must try it on.”\n\n“Don't you dare put that on your head until your hair is washed and\nproperly combed,” said Margaret.\n\n“Oh!” cried Elnora. “Is that water to wash my hair? I thought it was to\nset the colour in another dress.”\n\n“Well, you thought wrong,” said Margaret simply. “Your hair is going to\nbe washed and brushed until it shines like copper. While it dries you\ncan eat your supper, and this dress will be finished. Then you can put\non your new ribbon, and your hat. You can try your shoes now, and if\nthey don't fit, you and Wesley can drive to town and change them. That\nlittle round bundle on the top of the basket is your stockings.”\n\nMargaret sat down and began sewing swiftly, and a little later opened\nthe machine, and ran several long seams.\n\nElnora returned in a few minutes holding up her skirts and stepping\ndaintily in the new shoes.\n\n“Don't soil them, honey, else you're sure they fit,” cautioned Wesley.\n\n“They seem just a trifle large, maybe,” said Elnora dubiously, and\nWesley knelt to feel. He and Margaret thought them a fit, and then\nElnora appealed to her mother. Mrs. Comstock appeared wiping her hands\non her apron. She examined the shoes critically.\n\n“They seem to fit,” she said, “but they are away too fine to walk\ncountry roads.”\n\n“I think so, too,” said Elnora instantly. “We had better take these back\nand get a cheaper pair.”\n\n“Oh, let them go for this time,” said Mrs. Comstock. “They are so\npretty, I hate to part with them. You can get cheaper ones after this.”\n\nWesley and Margaret scarcely breathed for a long time.\n\nWhen Wesley went to do the feeding. Elnora set the table. When the\nwater was hot, Margaret pinned a big towel around Elnora's shoulders and\nwashed and dried the lovely hair according to the instructions she had\nbeen given the previous night. As the hair began to dry it billowed out\nin a sparkling sheen that caught the light and gleamed and flashed.\n\n“Now, the idea is to let it stand naturally, just as the curl will make\nit. Don't you do any of that nasty, untidy snarling, Elnora,” cautioned\nMargaret. “Wash it this way every two weeks while you are in school,\nshake it out, and dry it. Then part it in the middle and turn a front\nquarter on each side from your face. You tie the back at your neck with\na string--so, and the ribbon goes in a big, loose bow. I'll show you.”\n One after another Margaret Sinton tied the ribbons, creasing each of\nthem so they could not be returned, as she explained that she was trying\nto find the colour most becoming. Then she produced the raincoat which\ncarried Elnora into transports.\n\nMrs. Comstock objected. “That won't be warm enough for cold weather, and\nyou can't afford it and a coat, too.”\n\n“I'll tell you what I thought,” said Elnora. “I was planning on the way\nhome. These coats are fine because they keep you dry. I thought I would\nget one, and a warm sweater to wear under it cold days. Then I always\nwould be dry, and warm. The sweater only costs three dollars, so I could\nget it and the raincoat both for half the price of a heavy cloth coat.”\n\n“You are right about that,” said Mrs. Comstock. “You can change more\nwith the weather, too. Keep the raincoat, Elnora.”\n\n“Wear it until you try the hat,” said Margaret. “It will have to do\nuntil the dress is finished.”\n\nElnora picked up the hat dubiously. “Mother, may I wear my hair as it is\nnow?” she asked.\n\n“Let me take a good look,” said Katharine Comstock.\n\nHeaven only knows what she saw. To Wesley and to Margaret the bright\nyoung face of Elnora, with its pink tints, its heavy dark brows, its\nbright blue-gray eyes, and its frame of curling reddish-brown hair was\nthe sweetest sight on earth, and at that instant Elnora was radiant.\n\n“So long as it's your own hair, and combed back as plain as it will go,\nI don't suppose it cuts much ice whether it's tied a little tighter or\nlooser,” conceded Mrs. Comstock. “If you stop right there, you may let\nit go at that.”\n\nElnora set the hat on her head. It was only a wide tan straw with three\nexquisite peacock quills at one side. Margaret Sinton cried out, Wesley\nslapped his knee and sighed deeply while Mrs. Comstock stood speechless\nfor a second.\n\n“I wish you had asked the price before you put that on,” she said\nimpatiently. “We never can afford it.”\n\n“It's not so much as you think,” said Margaret. “Don't you see what I\ndid? I had them take off the quills, and put on some of those Phoebe\nSimms gave me from her peacocks. The hat will only cost you a dollar and\na half.”\n\nShe avoided Wesley's eyes, and looked straight at Mrs. Comstock. Elnora\nremoved the hat to examine it.\n\n“Why, they are those reddish-tan quills of yours!” she cried. “Mother,\nlook how beautifully they are set on! I'd much rather have them than\nthose from the store.”\n\n“So would I,” said Mrs. Comstock. “If Margaret wants to spare them, that\nwill make you a beautiful hat; dirt cheap, too! You must go past Mrs.\nSimms and show her. She would be pleased to see them.”\n\nElnora sank into a chair and contemplated her toe. “Landy, ain't I a\nqueen?” she murmured. “What else have I got?”\n\n“Just a belt, some handkerchiefs, and a pair of top shoes for rainy days\nand colder weather,” said Margaret.\n\n“About those high shoes, that was my idea,” said Wesley. “Soon as it\nrains, low shoes won't do, and by taking two pairs at once I could get\nthem some cheaper. The low ones are two and the high ones two fifty,\ntogether three seventy-five. Ain't that cheap?”\n\n“That's a real bargain,” said Mrs. Comstock, “if they are good shoes,\nand they look it.”\n\n“This,” said Wesley, producing the last package, “is your Christmas\npresent from your Aunt Maggie. I got mine, too, but it's at the house.\nI'll bring it up in the morning.”\n\nHe handed Margaret the umbrella, and she passed it over to Elnora who\nopened it and sat laughing under its shelter. Then she kissed both of\nthem. She brought a pencil and a slip of paper to set down the prices\nthey gave her of everything they had brought except the umbrella, added\nthe sum, and said laughingly: “Will you please wait till to-morrow for\nthe money? I will have it then, sure.”\n\n“Elnora,” said Wesley Sinton. “Wouldn't you----”\n\n“Elnora, hustle here a minute!” called Mrs. Comstock from the kitchen.\n“I need you!”\n\n“One second, mother,” answered Elnora, throwing off the coat and hat,\nand closing the umbrella as she ran. There were several errands to do\nin a hurry, and then supper. Elnora chattered incessantly, Wesley and\nMargaret talked all they could, while Mrs. Comstock said a word now and\nthen, which was all she ever did. But Wesley Sinton was watching her,\nand time and again he saw a peculiar little twist around her mouth. He\nknew that for the first time in sixteen years she really was laughing\nover something. She had all she could do to preserve her usually sober\nface. Wesley knew what she was thinking.\n\nAfter supper the dress was finished, the pattern for the next one\ndiscussed, and then the Sintons went home. Elnora gathered her\ntreasures. When she started upstairs she stopped. “May I kiss you\ngood-night, mother?” she asked lightly.\n\n“Never mind any slobbering,” said Mrs. Comstock. “I should think you'd\nlived with me long enough to know that I don't care for it.”\n\n“Well, I'd love to show you in some way how happy I am, and how I thank\nyou.”\n\n“I wonder what for?” said Mrs. Comstock. “Mag Sinton chose that stuff\nand brought it here and you pay for it.”\n\n“Yes, but you seemed willing for me to have it, and you said you would\nhelp me if I couldn't pay all.”\n\n“Maybe I did,” said Mrs. Comstock. “Maybe I did. I meant to get you some\nheavy dress skirts about Thanksgiving, and I still can get them. Go to\nbed, and for any sake don't begin mooning before a mirror, and make a\ndunce of yourself.”\n\nMrs. Comstock picked up several papers and blew out the kitchen light.\nShe stood in the middle of the sitting-room floor for a time and then\nwent into her room and closed the door. Sitting on the edge of the bed\nshe thought for a few minutes and then suddenly buried her face in the\npillow and again heaved with laughter.\n\nDown the road plodded Margaret and Wesley Sinton. Neither of them had\nwords to utter their united thought.\n\n“Done!” hissed Wesley at last. “Done brown! Did you ever feel like a\nbloomin', confounded donkey? How did the woman do it?”\n\n“She didn't do it!” gulped Margaret through her tears. “She didn't do\nanything. She trusted to Elnora's great big soul to bring her out right,\nand really she was right, and so it had to bring her. She's a darling,\nWesley! But she's got a time before her. Did you see Kate Comstock grab\nthat money? Before six months she'll be out combing the Limberlost for\nbugs and arrow points to help pay the tax. I know her.”\n\n“Well, I don't!” exclaimed Sinton, “she's too many for me. But there is\na laugh left in her yet! I didn't s'pose there was. Bet you a dollar,\nif we could see her this minute, she'd be chuckling over the way we got\nleft.”\n\nBoth of them stopped in the road and looked back.\n\n“There's Elnora's light in her room,” said Margaret. “The poor child\nwill feel those clothes, and pore over her books till morning, but\nshe'll look decent to go to school, anyway. Nothing is too big a price\nto pay for that.”\n\n“Yes, if Kate lets her wear them. Ten to one, she makes her finish the\nweek with that old stuff!”\n\n“No, she won't,” said Margaret. “She'll hardly dare. Kate made some\nconcessions, all right; big ones for her--if she did get her way in\nthe main. She bent some, and if Elnora proves that she can walk out\nbarehanded in the morning and come back with that much money in her\npocket, an armful of books, and buy a turnout like that, she proves\nthat she is of some consideration, and Kate's smart enough. She'll think\ntwice before she'll do that. Elnora won't wear a calico dress to high\nschool again. You watch and see if she does. She may have the best\nclothes she'll get for a time, for the least money, but she won't know\nit until she tries to buy goods herself at the same rates. Wesley, what\nabout those prices? Didn't they shrink considerable?”\n\n“You began it,” said Wesley. “Those prices were all right. We didn't say\nwhat the goods cost us, we said what they would cost her. Surely, she's\nmistaken about being able to pay all that. Can she pick up stuff of that\nvalue around the Limberlost? Didn't the Bird Woman see her trouble, and\njust give her the money?”\n\n“I don't think so,” said Margaret. “Seems to me I've heard of her\npaying, or offering to pay those who would take the money, for bugs and\nbutterflies, and I've known people who sold that banker Indian stuff.\nOnce I heard that his pipe collection beat that of the Government at the\nPhiladelphia Centennial. Those things have come to have a value.”\n\n“Well, there's about a bushel of that kind of valuables piled up in the\nwoodshed, that belongs to Elnora. At least, I picked them up because she\nsaid she wanted them. Ain't it queer that she'd take to stones, bugs,\nand butterflies, and save them. Now they are going to bring her the very\nthing she wants the worst. Lord, but this is a funny world when you get\nto studying! Looks like things didn't all come by accident. Looks as if\nthere was a plan back of it, and somebody driving that knows the road,\nand how to handle the lines. Anyhow, Elnora's in the wagon, and when I\nget out in the night and the dark closes around me, and I see the stars,\nI don't feel so cheap. Maggie, how the nation did Kate Comstock do\nthat?”\n\n“You will keep on harping, Wesley. I told you she didn't do it. Elnora\ndid it! She walked in and took things right out of our hands. All Kate\nhad to do was to enjoy having it go her way, and she was cute enough\nto put in a few questions that sort of guided Elnora. But I don't know,\nWesley. This thing makes me think, too. S'pose we'd taken Elnora when\nshe was a baby, and we'd heaped on her all the love we can't on our\nown, and we'd coddled, petted, and shielded her, would she have made the\nwoman that living alone, learning to think for herself, and taking all\nthe knocks Kate Comstock could give, have made of her?”\n\n“You bet your life!” cried Wesley, warmly. “Loving anybody don't hurt\nthem. We wouldn't have done anything but love her. You can't hurt a\nchild loving it. She'd have learned to work, to study, and grown into a\nwoman with us, without suffering like a poor homeless dog.”\n\n“But you don't see the point, Wesley. She would have grown into a fine\nwoman with us; but as we would have raised her, would her heart ever\nhave known the world as it does now? Where's the anguish, Wesley, that\nchild can't comprehend? Seeing what she's seen of her mother hasn't\nhardened her. She can understand any mother's sorrow. Living life from\nthe rough side has only broadened her. Where's the girl or boy burning\nwith shame, or struggling to find a way, that will cross Elnora's path\nand not get a lift from her? She's had the knocks, but there'll never be\nany of the thing you call 'false pride' in her. I guess we better keep\nout. Maybe Kate Comstock knows what she's doing. Sure as you live,\nElnora has grown bigger on knocks than she would on love.”\n\n“I don't s'pose there ever was a very fine point to anything but I\nmissed it,” said Wesley, “because I am blunt, rough, and have no book\nlearning to speak of. Since you put it into words I see what you mean,\nbut it's dinged hard on Elnora, just the same. And I don't keep out.\nI keep watching closer than ever. I got my slap in the face, but if I\ndon't miss my guess, Kate Comstock learned her lesson, same as I did.\nShe learned that I was in earnest, that I would haul her to court if she\ndidn't loosen up a bit, and she'll loosen. You see if she doesn't. It\nmay come hard, and the hinges creak, but she'll fix Elnora decent after\nthis, if Elnora doesn't prove that she can fix herself. As for me, I\nfound out that what I was doing was as much for myself as for Elnora. I\nwanted her to take those things from us, and love us for giving them. It\ndidn't work, and but for you, I'd messed the whole thing and stuck like\na pig in crossing a bridge. But you helped me out; Elnora's got the\nclothes, and by morning, maybe I won't grudge Kate the only laugh she's\nhad in sixteen years. You been showing me the way quite a spell now,\nain't you, Maggie?”\n\nIn her attic Elnora lighted two candles, set them on her little table,\nstacked the books, and put away the precious clothes. How lovingly she\nhung the hat and umbrella, folded the raincoat, and spread the new dress\nover a chair. She fingered the ribbons, and tried to smooth the\ncreases from them. She put away the hose neatly folded, touched the\nhandkerchiefs, and tried the belt. Then she slipped into her white\nnightdress, shook down her hair that it might become thoroughly dry,\nset a chair before the table, and reverently opened one of the books. A\nstiff draught swept the attic, for it stretched the length of the cabin,\nand had a window in each end. Elnora arose and going to the east window\nclosed it. She stood for a minute looking at the stars, the sky, and\nthe dark outline of the straggling trees of the rapidly dismantling\nLimberlost. In the region of her case a tiny point of light flashed and\ndisappeared. Elnora straightened and wondered. Was it wise to leave\nher precious money there? The light flashed once more, wavered a few\nseconds, and died out. The girl waited. She did not see it again, so she\nturned to her books.\n\nIn the Limberlost the hulking figure of a man sneaked down the trail.\n\n“The Bird Woman was at Freckles's room this evening,” he muttered.\n“Wonder what for?”\n\nHe left the trail, entered the enclosure still distinctly outlined,\nand approached the case. The first point of light flashed from the tiny\nelectric lamp on his vest. He took a duplicate key from his pocket, felt\nfor the padlock and opened it. The door swung wide. The light flashed\nthe second time. Swiftly his glance swept the interior.\n\n“'Bout a fourth of her moths gone. Elnora must have been with the\nBird Woman and given them to her.” Then he stood tense. His keen eyes\ndiscovered the roll of bills hastily thrust back in the bottom of the\ncase. He snatched them up, shut off the light, relocked the case by\ntouch, and swiftly went down the trail. Every few seconds he paused\nand listened intently. Just as he reached the road, a second figure\napproached him.\n\n“Is it you, Pete?” came the whispered question.\n\n“Yes,” said the first man.\n\n“I was coming down to take a peep, when I saw your flash,” he said. “I\nheard the Bird Woman had been at the case to-day. Anything doing?”\n\n“Not a thing,” said Pete. “She just took away about a fourth of the\nmoths. Probably had the Comstock girl getting them for her. Heard they\nwere together. Likely she'll get the rest to-morrow. Ain't picking\ngettin' bare these days?”\n\n“Well, I should say so,” said the second man, turning back in disgust.\n“Coming home, now?”\n\n“No, I am going down this way,” answered Pete, for his eyes caught the\ngleam from the window of the Comstock cabin, and he had a desire to\nlearn why Elnora's attic was lighted at that hour.\n\nHe slouched down the road, occasionally feeling the size of the roll he\nhad not taken time to count.\n\nThe attic was too long, the light too near the other end, and the cabin\nstood much too far back from the road. He could see nothing although\nhe climbed the fence and walked back opposite the window. He knew Mrs.\nComstock was probably awake, and that she sometimes went to the swamp\nbehind her home at night. At times a cry went up from that locality that\nparalyzed any one near, or sent them fleeing as if for life. He did not\ncare to cross behind the cabin. He returned to the road, passed, and\nagain climbed the fence. Opposite the west window he could see Elnora.\nShe sat before a small table reading from a book between two candles.\nHer hair fell in a bright sheen around her, and with one hand she\nlightly shook, and tossed it as she studied. The man stood out in the\nnight and watched.\n\nFor a long time a leaf turned at intervals and the hair-drying went on.\nThe man drew nearer. The picture grew more beautiful as he approached.\nHe could not see so well as he desired, for the screen was of white\nmosquito netting, and it angered him. He cautiously crept closer. The\nelevation shut off his view. Then he remembered the large willow tree\nshading the well and branching across the window fit the west end of\nthe cabin. From childhood Elnora had stepped from the sill to a limb and\nslid down the slanting trunk of the tree. He reached it and noiselessly\nswung himself up. Three steps out on the big limb the man shuddered. He\nwas within a few feet of the girl.\n\nHe could see the throb of her breast under its thin covering and smell\nthe fragrance of the tossing hair. He could see the narrow bed with its\npieced calico cover, the whitewashed walls with gay lithographs, and\nevery crevice stuck full of twigs with dangling cocoons. There were pegs\nfor the few clothes, the old chest, the little table, the two chairs,\nthe uneven floor covered with rag rugs and braided corn husk. But\nnothing was worth a glance except the perfect face and form within reach\nby one spring through the rotten mosquito bar. He gripped the limb above\nthat on which he stood, licked his lips, and breathed through his throat\nto be sure he was making no sound. Elnora closed the book and laid it\naside. She picked up a towel, and turning the gathered ends of her hair\nrubbed them across it, and dropping the towel on her lap, tossed the\nhair again. Then she sat in deep thought. By and by words began to come\nsoftly. Near as he was the man could not hear at first. He bent closer\nand listened intently.\n\n“--ever could be so happy,” murmured the soft voice. “The dress is so\npretty, such shoes, the coat, and everything. I won't have to be ashamed\nagain, not ever again, for the Limberlost is full of precious moths, and\nI always can collect them. The Bird Woman will buy more to-morrow, and\nthe next day, and the next. When they are all gone, I can spend every\nminute gathering cocoons, and hunting other things I can sell. Oh, thank\nGod, for my precious, precious money. Why, I didn't pray in vain after\nall! I thought when I asked the Lord to hide me, there in that big\nhall, that He wasn't doing it, because I wasn't covered from sight that\ninstant. But I'm hidden now, I feel that.” Elnora lifted her eyes to\nthe beams above her. “I don't know much about praying properly,” she\nmuttered, “but I do thank you, Lord, for hiding me in your own time and\nway.”\n\nHer face was so bright that it shone with a white radiance. Two big\ntears welled from her eyes, and rolled down her smiling cheeks. “Oh, I\ndo feel that you have hidden me,” she breathed. Then she blew out the\nlights, and the little wooden bed creaked under her weight.\n\nPete Corson dropped from the limb and found his way to the road. He\nstood still a long time, then started back to the Limberlost. A tiny\npoint of light flashed in the region of the case. He stopped with an\noath.\n\n“Another hound trying to steal from a girl,” he exclaimed. “But it's\nlikely he thinks if he gets anything it will be from a woman who can\nafford it, as I did.”\n\nHe went on, but beside the fences, and very cautiously.\n\n“Swamp seems to be alive to-night,” he muttered. “That's three of us\nout.”\n\nHe entered a deep place at the northwest corner, sat on the ground and\ntaking a pencil from his pocket, he tore a leaf from a little notebook,\nand laboriously wrote a few lines by the light he carried. Then he went\nback to the region of the case and waited. Before his eyes swept the\nvision of the slender white creature with tossing hair. He smiled, and\nworshipped it, until a distant rooster faintly announced dawn.\n\nThen he unlocked the case again, and replaced the money, laid the note\nupon it, and went back to concealment, where he remained until Elnora\ncame down the trail in the morning, appearing very lovely in her new\ndress and hat.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nWHEREIN ELNORA RECEIVES A WARNING, AND BILLY APPEARS ON THE SCENE\n\n\nIt would be difficult to describe how happy Elnora was that morning as\nshe hurried through her work, bathed and put on the neat, dainty gingham\ndress, and the tan shoes. She had a struggle with her hair. It crinkled,\nbillowed, and shone, and she could not avoid seeing the becoming frame\nit made around her face. But in deference to her mother's feelings\nthe girl set her teeth, and bound her hair closely to her head with a\nshoe-string. “Not to be changed at the case,” she told herself.\n\nThat her mother was watching she was unaware. Just as she picked up the\nbeautiful brown ribbon Mrs. Comstock spoke.\n\n“You had better let me tie that. You can't reach behind yourself and do\nit right.”\n\nElnora gave a little gasp. Her mother never before had proposed to do\nanything for the girl that by any possibility she could do herself. Her\nheart quaked at the thought of how her mother would arrange that bow,\nbut Elnora dared not refuse. The offer was too precious. It might never\nbe made again.\n\n“Oh thank you!” said the girl, and sitting down she held out the ribbon.\n\nHer mother stood back and looked at her critically.\n\n“You haven't got that like Mag Sinton had it last night,” she announced.\n“You little idiot! You've tried to plaster it down to suit me, and you\nmissed it. I liked it away better as Mag fixed it, after I saw it. You\ndidn't look so peeled.”\n\n“Oh mother, mother!” laughed Elnora, with a half sob in her voice.\n\n“Hold still, will you?” cried Mrs. Comstock. “You'll be late, and I\nhaven't packed your dinner yet.”\n\nShe untied the string and shook out the hair. It rose with electricity\nand clung to her fingers and hands. Mrs. Comstock jumped back as if\nbitten. She knew that touch. Her face grew white, and her eyes angry.\n\n“Tie it yourself,” she said shortly, “and then I'll put on the ribbon.\nBut roll it back loose like Mag did. It looked so pretty that way.”\n\nAlmost fainting Elnora stood before the glass, divided off the front\nparts of her hair, and rolled them as Mrs. Sinton had done; tied it at\nthe nape of her neck, then sat while her mother arranged the ribbon.\n\n“If I pull it down till it comes tight in these creases where she had\nit, it will be just right, won't it?” queried Mrs. Comstock, and the\namazed Elnora stammered,\n\n“Yes.”\n\nWhen she looked in the glass the bow was perfectly tied, and how the\ngold tone of the brown did match the lustre of the shining hair! “That's\npretty,” commented Mrs. Comstock's soul, but her stiff lips had said all\nthat could be forced from them for once. Just then Wesley Sinton came to\nthe door.\n\n“Good morning,” he cried heartily. “Elnora, you look a picture! My,\nbut you're sweet! If any of the city boys get sassy you tell your Uncle\nWesley, and he'll horsewhip them. Here's your Christmas present from\nme.” He handed Elnora the leather lunch box, with her name carved across\nthe strap in artistic lettering.\n\n“Oh Uncle Wesley!” was all Elnora could say.\n\n“Your Aunt Maggie filled it for me for a starter,” he said. “Now, if you\nare ready, I'm going to drive past your way and you can ride almost to\nOnabasha with me, and save the new shoes that much.”\n\nElnora was staring at the box. “Oh I hope it isn't impolite to open it\nbefore you,” she said. “I just feel as if I must see inside.”\n\n“Don't you stand on formality with the neighbours,” laughed Sinton.\n“Look in your box if you want to!”\n\nElnora slipped the strap and turned back the lid.\n\nThis disclosed the knife, fork, napkin, and spoon, the milk flask, and\nthe interior packed with dainty sandwiches wrapped in tissue paper, and\nthe little compartments for meat, salad, and the custard cup.\n\n“Oh mother!” cried Elnora. “Oh mother, isn't it fine? What made you\nthink of it, Uncle Wesley? How will I ever thank you? No one will have a\nfiner lunch box than I. Oh I do thank you! That's the nicest gift I ever\nhad. How I love Christmas in September!”\n\n“It's a mighty handy thing,” assented Mrs. Comstock, taking in every\ndetail with sharp eyes. “I guess you are glad now you went and helped\nMag and Wesley when you could, Elnora?”\n\n“Deedy, yes,” laughed Elnora, “and I'm going again first time they have\na big day if I stay from school to do it.”\n\n“You'll do no such thing!” said the delighted Sinton. “Come now, if\nyou're going!”\n\n“If I ride, can you spare me time to run into the swamp to my box a\nminute?” asked Elnora.\n\nThe light she had seen the previous night troubled her.\n\n“Sure,” said Wesley largely. So they drove away and left a white-faced\nwoman watching them from the door, her heart a little sorer than usual.\n\n“I'd give a pretty to hear what he'll say to her!” she commented\nbitterly. “Always sticking in, always doing things I can't ever afford.\nWhere on earth did he get that thing and what did it cost?”\n\nThen she entered the cabin and began the day's work, but mingled with\nthe brooding bitterness of her soul was the vision of a sweet young\nface, glad with a gladness never before seen on it, and over and over\nshe repeated: “I wonder what he'll say to her!”\n\nWhat he said was that she looked as fresh and sweet as a posy, and to be\ncareful not to step in the mud or scratch her shoes when she went to the\ncase.\n\nElnora found her key and opened the door. Not where she had placed it,\nbut conspicuously in front lay her little heap of bills, and a crude\nscrawl of writing beside it. Elnora picked up the note in astonishment.\n\n\nDERE ELNORY,\n\nthe lord amighty is hiding you all right done you ever dout it this\nmoney of yourn was took for some time las nite but it is returned with\nintres for god sake done ever come to the swamp at nite or late evnin or\nmornin or far in any time sompin worse an you know could git you\n\nA FREND.\n\n\nElnora began to tremble. She hastily glanced around. The damp earth\nbefore the case had been trodden by large, roughly shod feet. She caught\nup the money and the note, thrust them into her guimpe, locked the case,\nand ran to the road.\n\nShe was so breathless and her face so white Sinton noticed it.\n\n“What in the world's the matter, Elnora?” he asked.\n\n“I am half afraid!” she panted.\n\n“Tut, tut, child!” said Wesley Sinton. “Nothing in the world to be\nafraid of. What happened?”\n\n“Uncle Wesley,” said Elnora, “I had more money than I brought home last\nnight, and I put it in my case. Some one has been there. The ground is\nall trampled, and they left this note.”\n\n“And took your money, I'll wager,” said Sinton angrily.\n\n“No,” answered Elnora. “Read the note, and oh Uncle Wesley, tell me what\nit means!”\n\nSinton's face was a study. “I don't know what it means,” he said. “Only\none thing is clear. It means some beast who doesn't really want to harm\nyou has got his eye on you, and he is telling you plain as he can, not\nto give him a chance. You got to keep along the roads, in the open, and\nnot let the biggest moth that ever flew toll you out of hearing of us,\nor your mother. It means that, plain and distinct.”\n\n“Just when I can sell them! Just when everything is so lovely on account\nof them! I can't! I can't stay away from the swamp. The Limberlost is\ngoing to buy the books, the clothes, pay the tuition, and even start a\ncollege fund. I just can't!”\n\n“You've got to,” said Sinton. “This is plain enough. You go far in the\nswamp at your own risk, even in daytime.”\n\n“Uncle Wesley,” said the girl, “last night before I went to bed, I was\nso happy I tried to pray, and I thanked God for hiding me 'under the\nshadow of His wing.' But how in the world could any one know it?”\n\nWesley Sinton's heart leaped in his breast. His face was whiter than the\ngirl's now.\n\n“Were you praying out loud, honey?” he almost whispered.\n\n“I might have said words,” answered Elnora. “I know I do sometimes.\nI've never had any one to talk with, and I've played with and talked to\nmyself all my life. You've caught me at it often, but it always makes\nmother angry when she does. She says it's silly. I forget and do it,\nwhen I'm alone. But Uncle Wesley, if I said anything last night, you\nknow it was the merest whisper, because I'd have been so afraid of\nwaking mother. Don't you see? I sat up late, and studied two lessons.”\n\nSinton was steadying himself “I'll stop and examine the case as I come\nback,” he said. “Maybe I can find some clue. That other--that was just\naccidental. It's a common expression. All the preachers use it. If I\ntried to pray, that would be the very first thing I'd say.”\n\nThe colour returned to Elnora's face.\n\n“Did you tell your mother about this money, Elnora?” he asked.\n\n“No, I didn't,” said Elnora. “It's dreadful not to, but I was afraid.\nYou see they are clearing the swamp so fast. Every year it grows more\ndifficult to find things, and Indian stuff becomes scarcer. I want to\ngraduate, and that's four years unless I can double on the course. That\nmeans twenty dollars tuition each year, and new books, and clothes.\nThere won't ever be so much at one time again, that I know. I just got\nto hang to my money. I was afraid to tell her, for fear she would want\nit for taxes, and she really must sell a tree or some cattle for that,\nmustn't she, Uncle Wesley?”\n\n“On your life, she must!” said Wesley. “You put your little wad in the\nbank all safe, and never mention it to a living soul. It doesn't seem\nright, but your case is peculiar. Every word you say is a true word.\nEach year you will find less in the swamp, and things everywhere will\nbe scarcer. If you ever get a few dollars ahead, that can start your\ncollege fund. You know you are going to college, Elnora!”\n\n“Of course I am,” said Elnora. “I settled that as soon as I knew what a\ncollege was. I will put all my money in the bank, except what I owe you.\nI'll pay that now.”\n\n“If your arrows are heavy,” said Wesley, “I'll drive on to Onabasha with\nyou.”\n\n“But they are not. Half of them were nicked, and this little box held\nall the good ones. It's so surprising how many are spoiled when you wash\nthem.”\n\n“What does he pay?”\n\n“Ten cents for any common perfect one, fifty for revolvers, a dollar for\nobsidian, and whatever is right for enormous big ones.”\n\n“Well, that sounds fair,” said Sinton. “You can come down Saturday and\nwash the stuff at our house, and I'll take it in when we go marketing in\nthe afternoon.”\n\nElnora jumped from the carriage. She soon found that with her books, her\nlunch box, and the points she had a heavy load. She had almost reached\nthe bridge crossing the culvert when she heard distressed screams of a\nchild. Across an orchard of the suburbs came a small boy, after him a\nbig dog, urged by a man in the background. Elnora's heart was with the\nsmall fleeing figure in any event whatever. She dropped her load on\nthe bridge, and with practised hand flung a stone at the dog. The beast\ncurled double with a howl. The boy reached the fence, and Elnora was\nthere to help him over. As he touched the top she swung him to the\nground, but he clung to her, clasping her tightly, sobbing with fear.\nElnora helped him to the bridge, and sat with him in her arms. For a\ntime his replies to her questions were indistinct, but at last he became\nquieter and she could understand.\n\nHe was a mite of a boy, nothing but skin-covered bones, his burned,\nfreckled face in a mortar of tears and dust, his clothing unspeakably\ndirty, one great toe in a festering mass from a broken nail, and sores\nall over the visible portions of the small body.\n\n“You won't let the mean old thing make his dog get me!” he wailed.\n\n“Indeed no,” said Elnora, holding him closely.\n\n“You wouldn't set a dog on a boy for just taking a few old apples when\nyou fed 'em to pigs with a shovel every day, would you?”\n\n“No, I would not,” said Elnora hotly.\n\n“You'd give a boy all the apples he wanted, if he hadn't any breakfast,\nand was so hungry he was all twisty inside, wouldn't you?”\n\n“Yes, I would,” said Elnora.\n\n“If you had anything to eat you would give me something right now,\nwouldn't you?”\n\n“Yes,” said Elnora. “There's nothing but just stones in the package. But\nmy dinner is in that case. I'll gladly divide.”\n\nShe opened the box. The famished child gave a little cry and reached\nboth hands. Elnora caught them back.\n\n“Did you have any supper?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Any dinner yesterday?”\n\n“An apple and some grapes I stole.”\n\n“Whose boy are you?”\n\n“Old Tom Billings's.”\n\n“Why doesn't your father get you something to eat?”\n\n“He does most days, but he's drunk now.”\n\n“Hush, you must not!” said Elnora. “He's your father!”\n\n“He's spent all the money to get drunk, too,” said the boy, “and Jimmy\nand Belle are both crying for breakfast. I'd a got out all right with an\napple for myself, but I tried to get some for them and the dog got too\nclose. Say, you can throw, can't you?”\n\n“Yes,” admitted Elnora. She poured half the milk into the cup. “Drink\nthis,” she said, holding it to him.\n\nThe boy gulped the milk and swore joyously, gripping the cup with\nshaking fingers.\n\n“Hush!” cried Elnora. “That's dreadful!”\n\n“What's dreadful?”\n\n“To say such awful words.”\n\n“Huh! pa says worser 'an that every breath he draws.”\n\nElnora saw that the child was older than she had thought. He might have\nbeen forty judging by his hard, unchildish expression.\n\n“Do you want to be like your father?”\n\n“No, I want to be like you. Couldn't a angel be prettier 'an you. Can I\nhave more milk?”\n\nElnora emptied the flask. The boy drained the cup. He drew a breath of\nsatisfaction as he gazed into her face.\n\n“You wouldn't go off and leave your little boy, would you?” he asked.\n\n“Did some one go away and leave you?”\n\n“Yes, my mother went off and left me, and left Jimmy and Belle, too,”\n said the boy. “You wouldn't leave your little boy, would you?”\n\n“No.”\n\nThe boy looked eagerly at the box. Elnora lifted a sandwich and\nuncovered the fried chicken. The boy gasped with delight.\n\n“Say, I could eat the stuff in the glass and the other box and carry the\nbread and the chicken to Jimmy and Belle,” he offered.\n\nElnora silently uncovered the custard with preserved cherries on top and\nhanded it and the spoon to the child. Never did food disappear faster.\nThe salad went next, and a sandwich and half a chicken breast followed.\n\n“I better leave the rest for Jimmy and Belle,” he said, “they're 'ist\nfightin' hungry.”\n\nElnora gave him the remainder of the carefully prepared lunch. The boy\nclutched it and ran with a sidewise hop like a wild thing. She covered\nthe dishes and cup, polished the spoon, replaced it, and closed the\ncase. She caught her breath in a tremulous laugh.\n\n“If Aunt Margaret knew that, she'd never forgive me,” she said. “It\nseems as if secrecy is literally forced upon me, and I hate it. What\nshall I do for lunch? I'll have to sell my arrows and keep enough money\nfor a restaurant sandwich.”\n\nSo she walked hurriedly into town, sold her points at a good price,\ndeposited her funds, and went away with a neat little bank book and the\nnote from the Limberlost carefully folded inside. Elnora passed down the\nhall that morning, and no one paid the slightest attention to her.\nThe truth was she looked so like every one else that she was perfectly\ninconspicuous. But in the coat room there were members of her class.\nSurely no one intended it, but the whisper was too loud.\n\n“Look at the girl from the Limberlost in the clothes that woman gave\nher!”\n\nElnora turned on them. “I beg your pardon,” she said unsteadily, “I\ncouldn't help hearing that! No one gave me these clothes. I paid for\nthem myself.”\n\nSome one muttered, “Pardon me,” but incredulous faces greeted her.\n\nElnora felt driven. “Aunt Margaret selected them, and she meant to give\nthem to me,” she explained, “but I wouldn't take them. I paid for them\nmyself.” There was silence.\n\n“Don't you believe me?” panted Elnora.\n\n“Really, it is none of our affair,” said another girl. “Come on, let's\ngo.”\n\nElnora stepped before the girl who had spoken. “You have made this your\naffair,” she said, “because you told a thing which was not true. No one\ngave me what I am wearing. I paid for my clothes myself with money I\nearned selling moths to the Bird Woman. I just came from the bank where\nI deposited what I did not use. Here is my credit.” Elnora drew out and\noffered the little red book. “Surely you will believe that,” she said.\n\n“Why of course,” said the girl who first had spoken. “We met such a\nlovely woman in Brownlee's store, and she said she wanted our help to\nbuy some things for a girl, and that's how we came to know.”\n\n“Dear Aunt Margaret,” said Elnora, “it was like her to ask you. Isn't\nshe splendid?”\n\n“She is indeed,” chorused the girls. Elnora set down her lunch box and\nbooks, unpinned her hat, hanging it beside the others, and taking up\nthe books she reached to set the box in its place and dropped it. With\na little cry she snatched at it and caught the strap on top. That pulled\nfrom the fastening, the cover unrolled, the box fell away as far as it\ncould, two porcelain lids rattled on the floor, and the one sandwich\nrolled like a cartwheel across the room. Elnora lifted a ghastly face.\nFor once no one laughed. She stood an instant staring.\n\n“It seems to be my luck to be crucified at every point of the compass,”\n she said at last. “First two days you thought I was a pauper, now you\nwill think I'm a fraud. All of you will believe I bought an expensive\nbox, and then was too poor to put anything but a restaurant sandwich in\nit. You must stop till I prove to you that I'm not.”\n\nElnora gathered up the lids, and kicked the sandwich into a corner.\n\n“I had milk in that bottle, see! And custard in the cup. There was salad\nin the little box, fried chicken in the large one, and nut sandwiches\nin the tray. You can see the crumbs of all of them. A man set a dog on a\nchild who was so starved he was stealing apples. I talked with him, and\nI thought I could bear hunger better, he was such a little boy, so I\ngave him my lunch, and got the sandwich at the restaurant.”\n\nElnora held out the box. The girls were laughing by that time. “You\ngoose,” said one, “why didn't you give him the money, and save your\nlunch?”\n\n“He was such a little fellow, and he really was hungry,” said Elnora.\n“I often go without anything to eat at noon in the fields and woods, and\nnever think of it.”\n\nShe closed the box and set it beside the lunches of other country\npupils. While her back was turned, into the room came the girl of her\nencounter on the first day, walked to the rack, and with an exclamation\nof approval took down Elnora's hat.\n\n“Just the thing I have been wanting!” she said. “I never saw such\nbeautiful quills in all my life. They match my new broadcloth to\nperfection. I've got to have that kind of quills for my hat. I never saw\nthe like! Whose is it, and where did it come from?”\n\nNo one said a word, for Elnora's question, the reply, and her answer,\nhad been repeated. Every one knew that the Limberlost girl had come out\nahead and Sadie Reed had not been amiable, when the little flourish had\nbeen added to Elnora's name in the algebra class. Elnora's swift glance\nwas pathetic, but no one helped her. Sadie Reed glanced from the hat to\nthe faces around her and wondered.\n\n“Why, this is the Freshman section, whose hat is it?” she asked again,\nthis time impatiently.\n\n“That's the tassel of the cornstock,” said Elnora with a forced laugh.\n\nThe response was genuine. Every one shouted. Sadie Reed blushed, but she\nlaughed also.\n\n“Well, it's beautiful,” she said, “especially the quills. They are\nexactly what I want. I know I don't deserve any kindness from you, but I\ndo wish you would tell me at whose store you found those quills.”\n\n“Gladly!” said Elnora. “You can't buy quills like those at a store. They\nare from a living bird. Phoebe Simms gathers them in her orchard as her\npeacocks shed them. They are wing quills from the males.”\n\nThen there was perfect silence. How was Elnora to know that not a girl\nthere would have told that?\n\n“I haven't a doubt but I can get you some,” she offered. “She gave Aunt\nMargaret a large bunch, and those are part of them. I am quite sure she\nhas more, and would spare some.”\n\nSadie Reed laughed shortly. “You needn't trouble,” she said, “I was\nfooled. I thought they were expensive quills. I wanted them for a\ntwenty-dollar velvet toque to match my new suit. If they are gathered\nfrom the ground, really, I couldn't use them.”\n\n“Only in spots!” said Elnora. “They don't just cover the earth. Phoebe\nSimms's peacocks are the only ones within miles of Onabasha, and they\nmoult but once a year. If your hat cost only twenty dollars, it's\nscarcely good enough for those quills. You see, the Almighty made and\ncoloured those Himself; and He puts the same kind on Phoebe Simms's\npeacocks that He put on the head of the family in the forests of Ceylon,\naway back in the beginning. Any old manufactured quill from New York\nor Chicago will do for your little twenty-dollar hat. You should have\nsomething infinitely better than that to be worthy of quills that are\nmade by the Creator.”\n\nHow those girls did laugh! One of them walked with Elnora to the\nauditorium, sat beside her during exercises, and tried to talk whenever\nshe dared, to keep Elnora from seeing the curious and admiring looks\nbent upon her.\n\nFor the brown-eyed boy whistled, and there was pantomime of all sorts\ngoing on behind Elnora's back that day. Happy with her books, no one\nknew how much she saw, and from her absorption in her studies it was\nevident she cared too little to notice.\n\nAfter school she went again to the home of the Bird Woman, and together\nthey visited the swamp and carried away more specimens. This time Elnora\nasked the Bird Woman to keep the money until noon of the next day, when\nshe would call for it and have it added to her bank account. She slowly\nwalked home, for the visit to the swamp had brought back full force the\nexperience of the morning. Again and again she examined the crude little\nnote, for she did not know what it meant, yet it bred vague fear. The\nonly thing of which Elnora knew herself afraid was her mother; when with\nwild eyes and ears deaf to childish pleading, she sometimes lost control\nof herself in the night and visited the pool where her husband had sunk\nbefore her, calling his name in unearthly tones and begging of the swamp\nto give back its dead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nWHEREIN MRS. COMSTOCK INDULGES IN “FRILLS,” AND BILLY REAPPEARS\n\n\nIt was Wesley Sinton who really wrestled with Elnora's problem while\nhe drove about his business. He was not forced to ask himself what it\nmeant; he knew. The old Corson gang was still holding together. Elder\nmembers who had escaped the law had been joined by a younger brother of\nJack's, and they met in the thickest of the few remaining fast places\nof the swamp to drink, gamble, and loaf. Then suddenly, there would be a\nrobbery in some country house where a farmer that day had sold his\nwheat or corn and not paid a visit to the bank; or in some neighbouring\nvillage.\n\nThe home of Mrs. Comstock and Elnora adjoined the swamp. Sinton's land\nlay next, and not another residence or man easy to reach in case of\ntrouble. Whoever wrote that note had some human kindness in his breast,\nbut the fact stood revealed that he feared his strength if Elnora were\ndelivered into his hands. Where had he been the previous night when\nhe heard that prayer? Was that the first time he had been in such\nproximity? Sinton drove fast, for he wished to reach the swamp before\nElnora and the Bird Woman would go there.\n\nAt almost four he came to the case, and dropping on his knees studied\nthe ground, every sense alert. He found two or three little heel prints.\nThose were made by Elnora or the Bird Woman. What Sinton wanted to learn\nwas whether all the remainder were the footprints of one man. It was\neasily seen, they were not. There were deep, even tracks made by fairly\nnew shoes, and others where a well-worn heel cut deeper on the inside of\nthe print than at the outer edge. Undoubtedly some of Corson's old gang\nwere watching the case, and the visits of the women to it. There was no\ndanger that any one would attack the Bird Woman. She never went to the\nswamp at night, and on her trips in the daytime, every one knew that she\ncarried a revolver, understood how to use it, and pursued her work in a\nfearless manner.\n\nElnora, prowling around the swamp and lured into the interior by the\nflight of moths and butterflies; Elnora, without father, money, or\nfriends save himself, to defend her--Elnora was a different proposition.\nFor this to happen just when the Limberlost was bringing the very desire\nof her heart to the girl, it was too bad.\n\nSinton was afraid for her, yet he did not want to add the burden of fear\nto Katharine Comstock's trouble, or to disturb the joy of Elnora in her\nwork. He stopped at the cabin and slowly went up the walk. Mrs. Comstock\nwas sitting on the front steps with some sewing. The work seemed to\nSinton as if she might be engaged in putting a tuck in a petticoat. He\nthought of how Margaret had shortened Elnora's dress to the accepted\nlength for girls of her age, and made a mental note of Mrs. Comstock's\noccupation.\n\nShe dropped her work on her lap, laid her hands on it and looked into\nhis face with a sneer.\n\n“You didn't let any grass grow under your feet,” she said.\n\nSinton saw her white, drawn face and comprehended.\n\n“I went to pay a debt and see about this opening of the ditch, Kate.”\n\n“You said you were going to prosecute me.”\n\n“Good gracious, Kate!” cried Sinton. “Is that what you have been\nthinking all day? I told you before I left yesterday that I would not\nneed do that. And I won't! We can't afford to quarrel over Elnora. She's\nall we've got. Now that she has proved that if you don't do just what\nI think you ought by way of clothes and schooling, she can take care of\nherself, I put that out of my head. What I came to see you about is\na kind of scare I've had to-day. I want to ask you if you ever see\nanything about the swamp that makes you think the old Corson gang is\nstill at work?”\n\n“Can't say that I do,” said Mrs. Comstock. “There's kind of dancing\nlights there sometimes, but I supposed it was just people passing along\nthe road with lanterns. Folks hereabout are none too fond of the swamp.\nI hate it like death. I've never stayed here a night in my life without\nRobert's revolver, clean and loaded, under my pillow, and the shotgun,\nsame condition, by the bed. I can't say that I'm afraid here at home.\nI'm not. I can take care of myself. But none of the swamp for me!”\n\n“Well, I'm glad you are not afraid, Kate, because I must tell you\nsomething. Elnora stopped at the case this morning, and somebody had\nbeen into it in the night.”\n\n“Broke the lock?”\n\n“No. Used a duplicate key. To-day I heard there was a man here last\nnight. I want to nose around a little.”\n\nSinton went to the east end of the cabin and looked up at the window.\nThere was no way any one could have reached it without a ladder, for the\nlogs were hewed and mortar filled the cracks even. Then he went to the\nwest end, the willow faced him as he turned the corner. He examined the\ntrunk carefully. There was no mistake about small particles of black\nswamp muck adhering to the sides of the tree. He reached the low\nbranches and climbed the willow. There was earth on the large limb\ncrossing Elnora's window. He stood on it, holding the branch as had\nbeen done the night before, and looked into the room. He could see very\nlittle, but he knew that if it had been dark outside and sufficiently\nlight for Elnora to study inside he could have seen vividly. He brought\nhis face close to the netting, and he could see the bed with its head\nto the east, at its foot the table with the candles and the chair before\nit, and then he knew where the man had been who had heard Elnora's\nprayer.\n\nMrs. Comstock had followed around the corner and stood watching him.\n“Do you think some slinking hulk was up there peekin' in at Elnora?” she\ndemanded indignantly.\n\n“There is muck on the trunk, and plenty on the limb,” said Sinton.\n“Hadn't you better get a saw and let me take this branch off?”\n\n“No, I hadn't,” said Mrs. Comstock. “First place, Elnora's climbed from\nthat window on that limb all her life, and it's hers. Second place, no\none gets ahead of me after I've had warning. Any crow that perches on\nthat roost again will get its feathers somewhat scattered. Look along\nthe fence, there, and see if you can find where he came in.”\n\nThe place was easy to find as was a trail leading for some distance west\nof the cabin.\n\n“You just go home, and don't fret yourself,” said Mrs. Comstock. “I'll\ntake care of this. If you should hear the dinner bell at any time in the\nnight you come down. But I wouldn't say anything to Elnora. She better\nkeep her mind on her studies, if she's going to school.”\n\nWhen the work was finished that night Elnora took her books and went\nto her room to prepare some lessons, but every few minutes she looked\ntoward the swamp to see if there were lights near the case. Mrs.\nComstock raked together the coals in the cooking stove, got out the\nlunch box, and sitting down she studied it grimly. At last she arose.\n\n“Wonder how it would do to show Mag Sinton a frill or two,” she\nmurmured.\n\nShe went to her room, knelt before a big black-walnut chest and hunted\nthrough its contents until she found an old-fashioned cook book. She\ntended the fire as she read and presently was in action. She first sawed\nan end from a fragrant, juicy, sugar-cured ham and put it to cook.\nThen she set a couple of eggs boiling, and after long hesitation began\ncreaming butter and sugar in a crock. An hour later the odour of the\nham, mingled with some of the richest spices of “happy Araby,” in a\ncombination that could mean nothing save spice cake, crept up to Elnora\nso strongly that she lifted her head and sniffed amazedly. She would\nhave given all her precious money to have gone down and thrown her arms\naround her mother's neck, but she did not dare move.\n\nMrs. Comstock was up early, and without a word handed Elnora the case as\nshe left the next morning.\n\n“Thank you, mother,” said Elnora, and went on her way.\n\nShe walked down the road looking straight ahead until she came to the\ncorner, where she usually entered the swamp. She paused, glanced that\nway and smiled. Then she turned and looked back. There was no one coming\nin any direction. She followed the road until well around the corner,\nthen she stopped and sat on a grassy spot, laid her books beside her and\nopened the lunch box. Last night's odours had in a measure prepared her\nfor what she would see, but not quite. She scarcely could believe her\nsenses. Half the bread compartment was filled with dainty sandwiches of\nbread and butter sprinkled with the yolk of egg and the remainder with\nthree large slices of the most fragrant spice cake imaginable. The meat\ndish contained shaved cold ham, of which she knew the quality, the\nsalad was tomatoes and celery, and the cup held preserved pear, clear as\namber. There was milk in the bottle, two tissue-wrapped cucumber pickles\nin the folding drinking-cup, and a fresh napkin in the ring. No lunch\nwas ever daintier or more palatable; of that Elnora was perfectly sure.\nAnd her mother had prepared it for her! “She does love me!” cried the\nhappy girl. “Sure as you're born she loves me; only she hasn't found it\nout yet!”\n\nShe touched the papers daintily, and smiled at the box as if it were a\nliving thing. As she began closing it a breath of air swept by, lifting\nthe covering of the cake. It was like an invitation, and breakfast\nwas several hours away. Elnora picked up a piece and ate it. That cake\ntasted even better than it looked. Then she tried a sandwich. How did\nher mother come to think of making them that way. They never had any at\nhome. She slipped out the fork, sampled the salad, and one-quarter of\npear. Then she closed the box and started down the road nibbling one\nof the pickles and trying to decide exactly how happy she was, but she\ncould find no standard high enough for a measure.\n\nShe was to go to the Bird Woman's after school for the last load from\nthe case. Saturday she would take the arrow points and specimens to the\nbank. That would exhaust her present supplies and give her enough money\nahead to pay for books, tuition, and clothes for at least two years. She\nwould work early and late gathering nuts. In October she would sell all\nthe ferns she could find. She must collect specimens of all tree leaves\nbefore they fell, gather nests and cocoons later, and keep her eyes wide\nopen for anything the grades could use. She would see the superintendent\nthat night about selling specimens to the ward buildings. She must be\nahead of any one else if she wanted to furnish these things. So she\napproached the bridge.\n\nThat it was occupied could be seen from a distance. As she came up she\nfound the small boy of yesterday awaiting her with a confident smile.\n\n“We brought you something!” he announced without greeting. “This is\nJimmy and Belle--and we brought you a present.”\n\nHe offered a parcel wrapped in brown paper.\n\n“Why, how lovely of you!” said Elnora. “I supposed you had forgotten me\nwhen you ran away so fast yesterday.”\n\n“Naw, I didn't forget you,” said the boy. “I wouldn't forget you, not\never! Why, I was ist a-hurrying to take them things to Jimmy and Belle.\nMy they was glad!”\n\nElnora glanced at the children. They sat on the edge of the bridge,\nobviously clad in a garment each, very dirty and unkept, a little boy\nand a girl of about seven and nine. Elnora's heart began to ache.\n\n“Say,” said the boy. “Ain't you going to look what we have gave you?”\n\n“I thought it wasn't polite to look before people,” answered Elnora. “Of\ncourse, I will, if you would like to have me.”\n\nElnora opened the package. She had been presented with a quarter of a\nstale loaf of baker's bread, and a big piece of ancient bologna.\n\n“But don't you want this yourselves?” she asked in surprise.\n\n“Gosh, no! I mean ist no,” said the boy. “We always have it. We got\nstacks this morning. Pa's come out of it now, and he's so sorry he got\nmore 'an ever we can eat. Have you had any before?”\n\n“No,” said Elnora, “I never did!”\n\nThe boy's eyes brightened and the girl moved restlessly.\n\n“We thought maybe you hadn't,” said the boy. “First you ever have, you\nlike it real well; but when you don't have anything else for a long\ntime, years an' years, you git so tired.” He hitched at the string which\nheld his trousers and watched Elnora speculatively.\n\n“I don't s'pose you'd trade what you got in that box for ist old bread\nand bologna now, would you? Mebby you'd like it! And I know, I ist know,\nwhat you got would taste like heaven to Jimmy and Belle. They never had\nnothing like that! Not even Belle, and she's most ten! No, sir-ee, they\nnever tasted things like you got!”\n\nIt was in Elnora's heart to be thankful for even a taste in time, as\nshe knelt on the bridge, opened the box and divided her lunch into three\nequal parts, the smaller boy getting most of the milk. Then she told\nthem it was school time and she must go.\n\n“Why don't you put your bread and bologna in the nice box?” asked the\nboy.\n\n“Of course,” said Elnora. “I didn't think.”\n\nWhen the box was arranged to the children's satisfaction all of them\naccompanied Elnora to the corner where she turned toward the high\nschool.\n\n“Billy,” said Elnora, “I would like you much better if you were cleaner.\nSurely, you have water! Can't you children get some soap and wash\nyourselves? Gentlemen are never dirty. You want to be a gentleman, don't\nyou?”\n\n“Is being clean all you have to do to be a gentleman?”\n\n“No,” said Elnora. “You must not say bad words, and you must be kind and\npolite to your sister.”\n\n“Must Belle be kind and polite to me, else she ain't a lady?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then Belle's no lady!” said Billy succinctly.\n\nElnora could say nothing more just then, and she bade them good-bye and\nstarted them home.\n\n“The poor little souls!” she mused. “I think the Almighty put them in\nmy way to show me real trouble. I won't be likely to spend much time\npitying myself while I can see them.” She glanced at the lunchbox. “What\non earth do I carry this for? I never had anything that was so strictly\nornamental! One sure thing! I can't take this stuff to the high school.\nYou never seem to know exactly what is going to happen to you while you\nare there.”\n\nAs if to provide a way out of her difficulty a big dog arose from a\nlawn, and came toward the gate wagging his tail. “If those children ate\nthe stuff, it can't possibly kill him!” thought Elnora, so she offered\nthe bologna. The dog accepted it graciously, and being a beast of\npedigree he trotted around to a side porch and laid the bologna before\nhis mistress. The woman snatched it, screaming: “Come, quick! Some one\nis trying to poison Pedro!” Her daughter came running from the house.\n“Go see who is on the street. Hurry!” cried the excited mother.\n\nEllen Brownlee ran and looked. Elnora was half a block away, and no\none nearer. Ellen called loudly, and Elnora stopped. Ellen came running\ntoward her.\n\n“Did you see any one give our dog something?” she cried as she\napproached.\n\nElnora saw no escape.\n\n“I gave it a piece of bologna myself,” she said. “It was fit to eat. It\nwouldn't hurt the dog.”\n\nEllen stood and looked at her. “Of course, I didn't know it was your\ndog,” explained Elnora. “I had something I wanted to throw to some dog,\nand that one looked big enough to manage it.”\n\nEllen had arrived at her conclusions. “Pass over that lunch box,” she\ndemanded.\n\n“I will not!” said Elnora.\n\n“Then I will have you arrested for trying to poison our dog,” laughed\nthe girl as she took the box.\n\n“One chunk of stale bread, one half mile of antique bologna contributed\nfor dog feed; the remains of cake, salad and preserves in an otherwise\nempty lunch box. One ham sandwich yesterday. I think it's lovely you\nhave the box. Who ate your lunch to-day?”\n\n“Same,” confessed Elnora, “but there were three of them this time.”\n\n“Wait, until I run back and tell mother about the dog, and get my\nbooks.”\n\nElnora waited. That morning she walked down the hall and into the\nauditorium beside one of the very nicest girls in Onabasha, and it was\nthe fourth day. But the surprise came at noon when Ellen insisted upon\nElnora lunching at the Brownlee home, and convulsed her parents and\nfamily, and overwhelmed Elnora with a greatly magnified, but moderately\naccurate history of her lunch box.\n\n“Gee! but it's a box, daddy!” cried the laughing girl. “It's carved\nleather and fastens with a strap that has her name on it. Inside are\ntrays for things all complete, and it bears evidence of having enclosed\ndelicious food, but Elnora never gets any. She's carried it two days\nnow, and both times it has been empty before she reached school. Isn't\nthat killing?”\n\n“It is, Ellen, in more ways than one. No girl is going to eat breakfast\nat six o'clock, walk three miles, and do good work without her lunch.\nYou can't tell me anything about that box. I sold it last Monday night\nto Wesley Sinton, one of my good country customers. He told me it was a\npresent for a girl who was worthy of it, and I see he was right.”\n\n“He's so good to me,” said Elnora. “Sometimes I look at him and wonder\nif a neighbour can be so kind to one, what a real father would be like.\nI envy a girl with a father unspeakably.”\n\n“You have cause,” said Ellen Brownlee. “A father is the very dearest\nperson in the whole round world, except a mother, who is just a dear.”\n The girl, starting to pay tribute to her father, saw that she must\ninclude her mother, and said the thing before she remembered what Mrs.\nSinton had told the girls in the store. She stopped in dismay. Elnora's\nface paled a trifle, but she smiled bravely.\n\n“Then I'm fortunate in having a mother,” she said.\n\nMr. Brownlee lingered at the table after the girls had excused\nthemselves and returned to school.\n\n“There's a girl Ellen can't see too much of, in my opinion,” he said.\n“She is every inch a lady, and not a foolish notion or action about her.\nI can't understand just what combination of circumstances produced her\nin this day.”\n\n“It has been an unusual case of repression, for one thing. She waits on\nher elders and thinks before she speaks,” said Mrs. Brownlee.\n\n“She's mighty pretty. She looks so sound and wholesome, and she's neatly\ndressed.”\n\n“Ellen says she was a fright the first two days. Long brown calico dress\nalmost touching the floor, and big, lumbering shoes. Those Sinton people\nbought her clothes. Ellen was in the store, and the woman stopped her\ncrowd and asked them about their dresses. She said the girl was not\npoor, but her mother was selfish and didn't care for her. But Elnora\nshowed a bank book the next day, and declared that she paid for the\nthings herself, so the Sinton people must just have selected them.\nThere's something peculiar about it, but nothing wrong I am sure. I'll\nencourage Ellen to ask her again.”\n\n“I should say so, especially if she is going to keep on giving away her\nlunch.”\n\n“She lunched with the Bird Woman one day this week.”\n\n“She did!”\n\n“Yes, she lives out by the Limberlost. You know the Bird Woman works\nthere a great deal, and probably knows her that way. I think the girl\ngathers specimens for her. Ellen says she knows more than the teachers\nabout any nature question that comes up, and she is going to lead all of\nthem in mathematics, and make them work in any branch.”\n\nWhen Elnora entered the coat room after having had luncheon with Ellen\nBrownlee there was such a difference in the atmosphere that she could\nfeel it.\n\n“I am almost sorry I have these clothes,” she said to Ellen.\n\n“In the name of sense, why?” cried the astonished girl.\n\n“Every one is so nice to me in them, it sets me to wondering if in time\nI could have made them be equally friendly in the others.”\n\nEllen looked at her introspectively. “I believe you could,” she\nannounced at last. “But it would have taken time and heartache, and your\nmind would have been less free to work on your studies. No one is happy\nwithout friends, and I just simply can't study when I am unhappy.”\n\nThat night the Bird Woman made the last trip to the swamp. Every\nspecimen she possibly could use had been purchased at a fair price, and\nthree additions had been made to the bank book, carrying the total a\nlittle past two hundred dollars. There remained the Indian relics to\nsell on Saturday, and Elnora had secured the order to furnish material\nfor nature work for the grades. Life suddenly grew very full. There was\nthe most excitingly interesting work for every hour, and that work was\nto pay high school expenses and start the college fund. There was one\nlittle rift in her joy. All of it would have been so much better if she\ncould have told her mother, and given the money into her keeping; but\nthe struggle to get a start had been so terrible, Elnora was afraid to\ntake the risk. When she reached home, she only told her mother that the\nlast of the things had been sold that evening.\n\n“I think,” said Mrs. Comstock, “that we will ask Wesley to move that box\nover here back of the garden for you. There you are apt to get tolled\nfarther into the swamp than you intend to go, and you might mire or\nsomething. There ought to be just the same things in our woods, and\nalong our swampy places, as there are in the Limberlost. Can't you hunt\nyour stuff here?”\n\n“I can try,” said Elnora. “I don't know what I can find until I do. Our\nwoods are undisturbed, and there is a possibility they might be even\nbetter hunting than the swamp. But I wouldn't have Freckles's case moved\nfor the world. He might come back some day, and not like it. I've tried\nto keep his room the best I could, and taking out the box would make\na big hole in one side of it. Store boxes don't cost much. I will have\nUncle Wesley buy me one, and set it up wherever hunting looks the best,\nearly in the spring. I would feel safer at home.”\n\n“Shall we do the work or have supper first?”\n\n“Let's do the work,” said Elnora. “I can't say that I'm hungry now.\nDoesn't seem as if I ever could be hungry again with such a lunch. I am\nquite sure no one carried more delicious things to eat than I.”\n\nMrs. Comstock was pleased. “I put in a pretty good hunk of cake. Did you\ndivide it with any one?”\n\n“Why, yes, I did,” admitted Elnora.\n\n“Who?”\n\nThis was becoming uncomfortable. “I ate the biggest piece myself,” said\nElnora, “and gave the rest to a couple of boys named Jimmy and Billy and\na girl named Belle. They said it was the very best cake they ever tasted\nin all their lives.”\n\nMrs. Comstock sat straight. “I used to be a master hand at spice cake,”\n she boasted. “But I'm a little out of practice. I must get to work\nagain. With the very weeds growing higher than our heads, we should\nraise plenty of good stuff to eat on this land, if we can't afford\nanything else but taxes.”\n\nElnora laughed and hurried up stairs to change her dress. Margaret\nSinton came that night bringing a beautiful blue one in its place, and\ncarried away the other to launder.\n\n“Do you mean to say those dresses are to be washed every two days?”\n questioned Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“They have to be, to look fresh,” replied Margaret. “We want our girl\nsweet as a rose.”\n\n“Well, of all things!” cried Mrs. Comstock. “Every two days! Any girl\nwho can't keep a dress clean longer than that is a dirty girl. You'll\nwear the goods out and fade the colours with so much washing.”\n\n“We'll have a clean girl, anyway.”\n\n“Well, if you like the job you can have it,” said Mrs. Comstock. “I\ndon't mind the washing, but I'm so inconvenient with an iron.”\n\nElnora sat late that night working over her lessons. The next morning\nshe put on her blue dress and ribbon and in those she was a picture.\nMrs. Comstock caught her breath with a queer stirring around her heart,\nand looked twice to be sure of what she saw. As Elnora gathered her\nbooks her mother silently gave her the lunch box.\n\n“Feels heavy,” said Elnora gaily. “And smelly! Like as not I'll be\ncalled upon to divide again.”\n\n“Then you divide!” said Mrs. Comstock. “Eating is the one thing we don't\nhave to economize on, Elnora. Spite of all I can do food goes to waste\nin this soil every day. If you can give some of those city children a\ntaste of the real thing, why, don't be selfish.”\n\nElnora went down the road thinking of the city children with whom she\nprobably would divide. Of course, the bridge would be occupied again. So\nshe stopped and opened the box.\n\n“I don't want to be selfish,” murmured Elnora, “but it really seems as\nif I can't give away this lunch. If mother did not put love into it,\nshe's substituted something that's likely to fool me.”\n\nShe almost felt her steps lagging as she approached the bridge. A very\nhungry dog had been added to the trio of children. Elnora loved all\ndogs, and as usual, this one came to her in friendliness. The\nchildren said “Good morning!” with alacrity, and another paper parcel\nlay conspicuous.\n\n“How are you this morning?” inquired Elnora.\n\n“All right!” cried the three, while the dog sniffed ravenously at the\nlunch box, and beat a perfect tattoo with his tail.\n\n“How did you like the bologna?” questioned Billy eagerly.\n\n“One of the girls took me to lunch at her home yesterday,” answered\nElnora.\n\nDawn broke beautifully over Billy's streaked face. He caught the package\nand thrust it toward Elnora.\n\n“Then maybe you'd like to try the bologna to-day!”\n\nThe dog leaped in glad apprehension of something, and Belle scrambled to\nher feet and took a step forward. The look of famished greed in her eyes\nwas more than Elnora could endure. It was not that she cared for the\nfood so much. Good things to eat had been in abundance all her life.\nShe wanted with this lunch to try to absorb what she felt must be\nan expression of some sort from her mother, and if it were not a\nmanifestation of love, she did not know what to think it. But it was her\nmother who had said “be generous.” She knelt on the bridge. “Keep back\nthe dog!” she warned the elder boy.\n\nShe opened the box and divided the milk between Billy and the girl.\nShe gave each a piece of cake leaving one and a sandwich. Billy pressed\nforward eagerly, bitter disappointment on his face, and the elder boy\nforgot his charge.\n\n“Aw, I thought they'd be meat!” lamented Billy.\n\nElnora could not endure that.\n\n“There is!” she said gladly. “There is a little pigeon bird. I want a\nteeny piece of the breast, for a sort of keepsake, just one bite, and\nyou can have the rest among you.”\n\nElnora drew the knife from its holder and cut off the wishbone. Then she\nheld the bird toward the girl.\n\n“You can divide it,” she said. The dog made a bound and seizing the\nsquab sprang from the bridge and ran for life. The girl and boy hurried\nafter him. With awful eyes Billy stared and swore tempestuously. Elnora\ncaught him and clapped her hand over the little mouth. A delivery wagon\ncame tearing down the street, the horse running full speed, passed the\nfleeing dog with the girl and boy in pursuit, and stopped at the bridge.\nHigh school girls began to roll from all sides of it.\n\n“A rescue! A rescue!” they shouted.\n\nIt was Ellen Brownlee and her crowd, and every girl of them carried a\nbig parcel. They took in the scene as they approached. The fleeing dog\nwith something in its mouth, the half-naked girl and boy chasing it\ntold the story. Those girls screamed with laughter as they watched the\npursuit.\n\n“Thank goodness, I saved the wishbone!” said Elnora. “As usual, I can\nprove that there was a bird.” She turned toward the box. Billy had\nimproved the time. He had the last piece of cake in one hand, and the\nlast bite of salad disappeared in one great gulp. Then the girls shouted\nagain.\n\n“Let's have a sample ourselves,” suggested one. She caught up the box\nand handed out the remaining sandwich. Another girl divided it into\nbites each little over an inch square, and then she lifted the cup lid\nand deposited a preserved strawberry on each bite. “One, two, three,\naltogether now!” she cried.\n\n“You old mean things!” screamed Billy.\n\nIn an instant he was down in the road and handfuls of dust began to fly\namong them. The girls scattered before him.\n\n“Billy!” cried Elnora. “Billy! I'll never give you another bite, if you\nthrow dust on any one!”\n\nThen Billy dropped the dust, bored both fists into his eyes, and fled\nsobbing into Elnora's new blue skirt. She stooped to meet him and\nconsolation began. Those girls laughed on. They screamed and shouted\nuntil the little bridge shook.\n\n“To-morrow might as well be a clear day,” said Ellen, passing around\nand feeding the remaining berries to the girls as they could compose\nthemselves enough to take them. “Billy, I admire your taste more than\nyour temper.”\n\nElnora looked up. “The little soul is nothing but skin and bones,” she\nsaid. “I never was really hungry myself; were any of you?”\n\n“Well, I should say so,” cried a plump, rosy girl. “I'm famished right\nnow. Let's have breakfast immediate!”\n\n“We got to refill this box first!” said Ellen Brownlee. “Who's got the\nbutter?” A girl advanced with a wooden tray.\n\n“Put it in the preserve cup, a little strawberry flavour won't hurt it.\nNext!” called Ellen.\n\nA loaf of bread was produced and Ellen cut off a piece which filled the\nsandwich box.\n\n“Next!” A bottle of olives was unwrapped. The grocer's boy who was\nwaiting opened that, and Ellen filled the salad dish.\n\n“Next!”\n\nA bag of macaroons was produced and the cake compartment filled.\n\n“Next!”\n\n“I don't suppose this will make quite as good dog feed as a bird,”\n laughed a girl holding open a bag of sliced ham while Ellen filled the\nmeat dish.\n\n“Next!”\n\nA box of candy was handed her and she stuffed every corner of the\nlunch box with chocolates and nougat. Then it was closed and formally\npresented to Elnora. The girls each helped themselves to candy and\nolives, and gave Billy the remainder of the food. Billy took one bite\nof ham, and approved. Belle and Jimmy had given up chasing the dog, and\nangry and ashamed, stood waiting half a block away.\n\n“Come back!” cried Billy. “You great big dunces, come back! They's a new\nkind of meat, and cake and candy.”\n\nThe boy delayed, but the girl joined Billy. Ellen wiped her fingers,\nstepped to the cement abutment and began reciting “Horatio at the\nBridge!” substituting Elnora wherever the hero appeared in the lines.\n\nElnora gathered up the sacks, and gave them to Belle, telling her to\ntake the food home, cut and spread the bread, set things on the table,\nand eat nicely.\n\nThen Elnora was taken into the wagon with the girls, and driven on the\nrun to the high school. They sang a song beginning--\n\n     “Elnora, please give me a sandwich.\n     I'm ashamed to ask for cake!”\n\nas they went. Elnora did not know it, but that was her initiation. She\nbelonged to “the crowd.” She only knew that she was happy, and vaguely\nwondered what her mother and Aunt Margaret would have said about the\nproceedings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nWHEREIN MRS. COMSTOCK MANIPULATES MARGARET AND BILLY ACQUIRES A\nRESIDENCE\n\n\nSaturday morning Elnora helped her mother with the work. When she had\nfinished Mrs. Comstock told her to go to Sintons' and wash her Indian\nrelics, so that she would be ready to accompany Wesley to town in the\nafternoon. Elnora hurried down the road and was soon at the cistern\nwith a tub busily washing arrow points, stone axes, tubes, pipes, and\nskin-cleaning implements.\n\nThen she went home, dressed and was waiting when the carriage reached\nthe gate. She stopped at the bank with the box, and Sinton went to do\nhis marketing and some shopping for his wife.\n\nAt the dry goods store Mr. Brownlee called to him, “Hello, Sinton! How\ndo you like the fate of your lunch box?” Then he began to laugh--\n\n“I always hate to see a man laughing alone,” said Sinton. “It looks so\nselfish! Tell me the fun, and let me help you.”\n\nMr. Brownlee wiped his eyes.\n\n“I supposed you knew, but I see she hasn't told.”\n\nThen the three days' history of the lunch box was repeated with\nparticulars which included the dog.\n\n“Now laugh!” concluded Mr. Brownlee.\n\n“Blest if I see anything funny!” replied Wesley Sinton. “And if you\nhad bought that box and furnished one of those lunches yourself, you\nwouldn't either. I call such a work a shame! I'll have it stopped.”\n\n“Some one must see to that, all right. They are little leeches. Their\nfather earns enough to support them, but they have no mother, and they\nrun wild. I suppose they are crazy for cooked food. But it is funny, and\nwhen you think it over you will see it, if you don't now.”\n\n“About where would a body find that father?” inquired Wesley Sinton\ngrimly. Mr. Brownlee told him and he started, locating the house with\nlittle difficulty. House was the proper word, for of home there was no\nsign. Just a small empty house with three unkept little children racing\nthrough and around it. The girl and the elder boy hung back, but dirty\nlittle Billy greeted Sinton with: “What you want here?”\n\n“I want to see your father,” said Sinton.\n\n“Well, he's asleep,” said Billy.\n\n“Where?” asked Sinton.\n\n“In the house,” answered Billy, “and you can't wake him.”\n\n“Well, I'll try,” said Wesley.\n\nBilly led the way. “There he is!” he said. “He is drunk again.”\n\nOn a dirty mattress in a corner lay a man who appeared to be strong and\nwell. Billy was right. You could not awake him. He had gone the limit,\nand a little beyond.\n\nHe was now facing eternity. Sinton went out and closed the door.\n\n“Your father is sick and needs help,” he said. “You stay here, and I\nwill send a man to see him.”\n\n“If you just let him 'lone, he'll sleep it off,” volunteered Billy.\n“He's that way all the time, but he wakes up and gets us something to\neat after awhile. Only waitin' twists you up inside pretty bad.”\n\nThe boy wore no air of complaint. He was merely stating facts.\n\nWesley Sinton looked intently at Billy. “Are you twisted up inside now?”\n he asked.\n\nBilly laid a grimy hand on the region of his stomach and the filthy\nlittle waist sank close to the backbone. “Bet yer life, boss,” he said\ncheerfully.\n\n“How long have you been twisted?” asked Sinton.\n\nBilly appealed to the others. “When was it we had the stuff on the\nbridge?”\n\n“Yesterday morning,” said the girl.\n\n“Is that all gone?” asked Sinton.\n\n“She went and told us to take it home,” said Billy ruefully, “and 'cos\nshe said to, we took it. Pa had come back, he was drinking some more,\nand he ate a lot of it--almost the whole thing, and it made him sick as\na dog, and he went and wasted all of it. Then he got drunk some more,\nand now he's asleep again. We didn't get hardly none.”\n\n“You children sit on the steps until the man comes,” said Sinton. “I'll\nsend you some things to eat with him. What's your name, sonny?”\n\n“Billy,” said the boy.\n\n“Well, Billy, I guess you better come with me. I'll take care of him,”\n Sinton promised the others. He reached a hand to Billy.\n\n“I ain't no baby, I'm a boy!” said Billy, as he shuffled along beside\nSinton, taking a kick at every movable object without regard to his\nbattered toes.\n\nOnce they passed a Great Dane dog lolling after its master, and Billy\nascended Sinton as if he were a tree, and clung to him with trembling\nhot hands.\n\n“I ain't afraid of that dog,” scoffed Billy, as he was again placed on\nthe walk, “but onc't he took me for a rat or somepin' and his teeth cut\ninto my back. If I'd a done right, I'd a took the law on him.”\n\nSinton looked down into the indignant little face. The child was bright\nenough, he had a good head, but oh, such a body!\n\n“I 'bout got enough of dogs,” said Billy. “I used to like 'em, but I'm\ngetting pretty tired. You ought to seen the lickin' Jimmy and Belle and\nme give our dog when we caught him, for taking a little bird she gave\nus. We waited 'till he was asleep 'nen laid a board on him and all of\nus jumped on it to onc't. You could a heard him yell a mile. Belle said\nmebbe we could squeeze the bird out of him. But, squeeze nothing! He was\nholler as us, and that bird was lost long 'fore it got to his stummick.\nIt was ist a little one, anyway. Belle said it wouldn't 'a' made a\nbite apiece for three of us nohow, and the dog got one good swaller. We\ndidn't get much of the meat, either. Pa took most of that. Seems like\npas and dogs gets everything.”\n\nBilly laughed dolefully. Involuntarily Wesley Sinton reached his hand.\nThey were coming into the business part of Onabasha and the streets were\ncrowded. Billy understood it to mean that he might lose his companion\nand took a grip. That little hot hand clinging tight to his, the sore\nfeet recklessly scouring the walk, the hungry child panting for breath\nas he tried to keep even, the brave soul jesting in the face of hard\nluck, caught Sinton in a tender, empty spot.\n\n“Say, son,” he said. “How would you like to be washed clean, and have\nall the supper your skin could hold, and sleep in a good bed?”\n\n“Aw, gee!” said Billy. “I ain't dead yet! Them things is in heaven! Poor\nfolks can't have them. Pa said so.”\n\n“Well, you can have them if you want to go with me and get them,”\n promised Sinton.\n\n“Honest?”\n\n“Yes, honest.”\n\n“Crost yer heart?”\n\n“Yes,” said Sinton.\n\n“Kin I take some to Jimmy and Belle?”\n\n“If you'll come with me and be my boy, I'll see that they have plenty.”\n\n“What will pa say?”\n\n“Your pa is in that kind of sleep now where he won't wake up, Billy,”\n said Sinton. “I am pretty sure the law will give you to me, if you want\nto come.”\n\n“When people don't ever wake up they're dead,” announced Billy. “Is my\npa dead?”\n\n“Yes, he is,” answered Sinton.\n\n“And you'll take care of Jimmy and Belle, too?”\n\n“I can't adopt all three of you,” said Sinton. “I'll take you, and see\nthat they are well provided for. Will you come?”\n\n“Yep, I'll come,” said Billy. “Let's eat, first thing we do.”\n\n“All right,” agreed Sinton. “Come into this restaurant.” He lifted Billy\nto the lunch counter and ordered the clerk to give him as many glasses\nof milk as he wanted, and a biscuit. “I think there's going to be fried\nchicken when we get home, Billy,” he said, “so you just take the edge\noff now, and fill up later.”\n\nWhile Billy lunched Sinton called up the different departments\nand notified the proper authorities ending with the Women's Relief\nAssociation. He sent a basket of food to Belle and Jimmy, bought Billy a\npair of trousers, and a shirt, and went to bring Elnora.\n\n“Why, Uncle Wesley!” cried the girl. “Where did you find Billy?”\n\n“I've adopted him for the time being, if not longer,” replied Wesley\nSinton.\n\n“Where did you get him?”\n\n“Well, young woman,” said Wesley Sinton, “Mr. Brownlee told me the\nhistory of your lunch box. It didn't seem so funny to me as it does to\nthe rest of them; so I went to look up the father of Billy's family, and\nmake him take care of them, or allow the law to do it for him. It will\nhave to be the law.”\n\n“He's deader than anything!” broke in Billy. “He can't ever take all the\nmeat any more.”\n\n“Billy!” gasped Elnora.\n\n“Never you mind!” said Sinton. “A child doesn't say such things about a\nfather who loved and raised him right. When it happens, the father alone\nis to blame. You won't hear Billy talk like that about me when I cross\nover.”\n\n“You don't mean you are going to take him to keep!”\n\n“I'll soon need help,” said Wesley. “Billy will come in just about right\nten years from now, and if I raise him I'll have him the way I want\nhim.”\n\n“But Aunt Margaret doesn't like boys,” objected Elnora.\n\n“Well, she likes me, and I used to be a boy. Anyway, as I remember\nshe has had her way about everything at our house ever since we were\nmarried. I am going to please myself about Billy. Hasn't she always done\njust as she chose so far as you know? Honest, Elnora!”\n\n“Honest!” replied Elnora. “You are beautiful to all of us, Uncle Wesley;\nbut Aunt Margaret won't like Billy. She won't want him in her home.”\n\n“In our home,” corrected Wesley.\n\n“What makes you want him?” marvelled Elnora.\n\n“God only knows,” said Sinton. “Billy ain't so beautiful, and he ain't\nso smart, I guess it's because he's so human. My heart goes out to him.”\n\n“So did mine,” said Elnora. “I love him. I'd rather see him eat my lunch\nthan have it myself any time.”\n\n“What makes you like him?” asked Wesley.\n\n“Why, I don't know,” pondered Elnora. “He's so little, he needs so\nmuch, he's got such splendid grit, and he's perfectly unselfish with his\nbrother and sister. But we must wash him before Aunt Margaret sees him.\nI wonder if mother----”\n\n“You needn't bother. I'm going to take him home the way he is,” said\nSinton. “I want Maggie to see the worst of it.”\n\n“I'm afraid----” began Elnora.\n\n“So am I,” said Wesley, “but I won't give him up. He's taken a sort of\ngrip on my heart. I've always been crazy for a boy. Don't let him hear\nus.”\n\n“Don't let him be killed!” cried Elnora. During their talk Billy had\nwandered to the edge of the walk and barely escaped the wheels of a\npassing automobile in an effort to catch a stray kitten that seemed in\ndanger.\n\nWesley drew Billy back to the walk, and held his hand closely. “Are you\nready, Elnora?”\n\n“Yes; you were gone a long time,” she said.\n\nWesley glanced at a package she carried. “Have to have another book?” he\nasked.\n\n“No, I bought this for mother. I've had such splendid luck selling my\nspecimens, I didn't feel right about keeping all the money for myself,\nso I saved enough from the Indian relics to get a few things I wanted.\nI would have liked to have gotten her a dress, but I didn't dare, so I\ncompromised on a book.”\n\n“What did you select, Elnora?” asked Wesley wonderingly.\n\n“Well,” said she, “I have noticed mother always seemed interested in\nanything Mark Twain wrote in the newspapers, and I thought it would\ncheer her up a little, so I just got his 'Innocents Abroad.' I haven't\nread it myself, but I've seen mention made of it all my life, and the\ncritics say it's genuine fun.”\n\n“Good!” cried Sinton. “Good! You've made a splendid choice. It will take\nher mind off herself a lot. But she will scold you.”\n\n“Of course,” assented Elnora. “But, possibly she will read it, and feel\nbetter. I'm going to serve her a trick. I am going to hide it until\nMonday, and set it on her little shelf of books the last thing before\nI go away. She must have all of them by heart. When, she sees a new one\nshe can't help being glad, for she loves to read, and if she has all day\nto become interested, maybe she'll like it so she won't scold so much.”\n\n“We are both in for it, but I guess we are prepared. I don't know what\nMargaret will say, but I'm going to take Billy home and see. Maybe he\ncan win with her, as he did with us.”\n\nElnora had doubts, but she did not say anything more. When they started\nhome Billy sat on the front seat. He drove with the hitching strap tied\nto the railing of the dash-board, flourished the whip, and yelled with\ndelight. At first Sinton laughed with him, but by the time he left\nElnora with several packages at her gate, he was looking serious enough.\n\nMargaret was at the door as they drove up the lane. Wesley left Billy in\nthe carriage, hitched the horses and went to explain to her. He had not\nreached her before she cried, “Look, Wesley, that child! You'll have a\nrunaway!”\n\nWesley looked and ran. Billy was standing in the carriage slashing the\nmettlesome horses with the whip.\n\n“See me make 'em go!” he shouted as the whip fell a second time.\n\nHe did make them go. They took the hitching post and a few fence\npalings, which scraped the paint from a wheel. Sinton missed the lines\nat the first effort, but the dragging post impeded the horses, and he\nsoon caught them. He led them to the barn, and ordered Billy to remain\nin the carriage while he unhitched. Then leading Billy and carrying his\npackages he entered the yard.\n\n“You run play a few minutes, Billy,” he said. “I want to talk to the\nnice lady.”\n\nThe nice lady was looking rather stupefied as Wesley approached her.\n\n“Where in the name of sense did you get that awful child?” she demanded.\n\n“He is a young gentleman who has been stopping Elnora and eating her\nlunch every day, part of the time with the assistance of his brother\nand sister, while our girl went hungry. Brownlee told me about it at the\nstore. It's happened three days running. The first time she went without\nanything, the second time Brownlee's girl took her to lunch, and the\nthird a crowd of high school girls bought a lot of stuff and met them at\nthe bridge. The youngsters seemed to think they could rob her every day,\nso I went to see their father about having it stopped.”\n\n“Well, I should think so!” cried Margaret.\n\n“There were three of them, Margaret,” said Wesley, “that little\nfellow----”\n\n“Hyena, you mean,” interpolated Margaret.\n\n“Hyena,” corrected Wesley gravely, “and another boy and a girl, all\nequally dirty and hungry. The man was dead. They thought he was in a\ndrunken sleep, but he was stone dead. I brought the little boy with me,\nand sent the officers and other help to the house. He's half starved.\nI want to wash him, and put clean clothes on him, and give him some\nsupper.”\n\n“Have you got anything to put on him?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Where did you get it?”\n\n“Bought it. It ain't much. All I got didn't cost a dollar.”\n\n“A dollar is a good deal when you work and save for it the way we do.”\n\n“Well, I don't know a better place to put it. Have you got any hot\nwater? I'll use this tub at the cistern. Please give me some soap and\ntowels.”\n\nInstead Margaret pushed by him with a shriek. Billy had played\nby producing a cord from his pocket, and having tied the tails of\nMargaret's white kittens together, he had climbed on a box and hung them\nacross the clothes line. Wild with fright the kittens were clawing each\nother to death, and the air was white with fur. The string had twisted\nand the frightened creatures could not recognize friends. Margaret\nstepped back with bleeding hands. Sinton cut the cord with his knife\nand the poor little cats raced under the house bleeding and disfigured.\nMargaret white with wrath faced Wesley.\n\n“If you don't hitch up and take that animal back to town,” she said, “I\nwill.”\n\nBilly threw himself on the grass and began to scream.\n\n“You said I could have fried chicken for supper,” he wailed. “You said\nshe was a nice lady!”\n\nWesley lifted him and something in his manner of handling the child\ninfuriated Margaret. His touch was so gentle. She reached for Billy and\ngripped his shirt collar in the back. Wesley's hand closed over hers.\n\n“Gently, girl!” he said. “This little body is covered with sores.”\n\n“Sores!” she ejaculated. “Sores? What kind of sores?”\n\n“Oh, they might be from bruises made by fists or boot toes, or they\nmight be bad blood, from wrong eating, or they might be pure filth. Will\nyou hand me some towels?”\n\n“No, I won't!” said Margaret.\n\n“Well, give me some rags, then.”\n\nMargaret compromised on pieces of old tablecloth. Wesley led Billy to\nthe cistern, pumped cold water into the tub, poured in a kettle of hot,\nand beginning at the head scoured him. The boy shut his little teeth,\nand said never a word though he twisted occasionally when the soap\nstruck a raw spot. Margaret watched the process from the window in\namazed and ever-increasing anger. Where did Wesley learn it? How could\nhis big hands be so gentle? He came to the door.\n\n“Have you got any peroxide?” he asked.\n\n“A little,” she answered stiffly.\n\n“Well, I need about a pint, but I'll begin on what you have.”\n\nMargaret handed him the bottle. Wesley took a cup, weakened the drug and\nsaid to Billy: “Man, these sores on you must be healed. Then you must\neat the kind of food that's fit for little men. I am going to put some\nmedicine on you, and it is going to sting like fire. If it just runs\noff, I won't use any more. If it boils, there is poison in these places,\nand they must be tied up, dosed every day, and you must be washed, and\nkept mighty clean. Now, hold still, because I am going to put it on.”\n\n“I think the one on my leg is the worst,” said the undaunted Billy,\nholding out a raw place. Sinton poured on the drug. Billy's body twisted\nand writhed, but he did not run.\n\n“Gee, look at it boil!” he cried. “I guess they's poison. You'll have to\ndo it to all of them.”\n\nWesley's teeth were set, as he watched the boy's face. He poured the\ndrug, strong enough to do effective work, on a dozen places over that\nlittle body and bandaged all he could. Billy's lips quivered at times,\nand his chin jumped, but he did not shed a tear or utter a sound other\nthan to take a deep interest in the boiling. As Wesley put the small\nshirt on the boy, and fastened the trousers, he was ready to reset the\nhitching post and mend the fence without a word.\n\n“Now am I clean?” asked Billy.\n\n“Yes, you are clean outside,” said Wesley. “There is some dirty blood\nin your body, and some bad words in your mouth, that we have to get out,\nbut that takes time. If we put right things to eat into your stomach\nthat will do away with the sores, and if you know that I don't like bad\nwords you won't say them any oftener than you can help, will you Billy?”\n\nBilly leaned against Wesley in apparent indifference.\n\n“I want to see me!” he demanded.\n\nWesley led the boy into the house, and lifted him to a mirror.\n\n“My, I'm purty good-looking, ain't I?” bragged Billy. Then as Wesley\nstooped to set him on the floor Billy's lips passed close to the big\nman's ear and hastily whispered a vehement “No!” as he ran for the door.\n\n“How long until supper, Margaret?” asked Wesley as he followed.\n\n“You are going to keep him for supper?” she asked\n\n“Sure!” said Wesley. “That's what I brought him for. It's likely he\nnever had a good square meal of decent food in his life. He's starved to\nthe bone.”\n\nMargaret arose deliberately, removed the white cloth from the supper\ntable and substituted an old red one she used to wrap the bread. She\nput away the pretty dishes they commonly used and set the table with old\nplates for pies and kitchen utensils. But she fried the chicken, and was\ngenerous with milk and honey, snowy bread, gravy, potatoes, and fruit.\n\nWesley repainted the scratched wheel. He mended the fence, with Billy\nholding the nails and handing the pickets. Then he filled the old hole,\ndigged a new one and set the hitching post.\n\nBilly hopped on one foot at his task of holding the post steady as the\nearth was packed around it. There was not the shadow of a trouble on his\nlittle freckled face.\n\nSinton threw in stones and pounded the earth solid around the post. The\nsound of a gulping sob attracted him to Billy. The tears were rolling\ndown his cheeks. “If I'd a knowed you'd have to get down in a hole, and\nwork so hard I wouldn't 'a' hit the horses,” he said.\n\n“Never you mind, Billy,” said Wesley. “You will know next time, so you\ncan think over it, and make up your mind whether you really want to\nbefore you strike.”\n\nWesley went to the barn to put away the tools. He thought Billy was at\nhis heels, but the boy lagged on the way. A big snowy turkey gobbler\nresented the small intruder in his especial preserves, and with spread\ntail and dragging wings came toward him threateningly. If that turkey\ngobbler had known the sort of things with which Billy was accustomed\nto holding his own, he never would have issued the challenge. Billy\naccepted instantly. He danced around with stiff arms at his sides and\nimitated the gobbler. Then came his opportunity, and he jumped on the\nbig turkey's back. Wesley heard Margaret's scream in time to see the\nflying leap and admire its dexterity. The turkey tucked its tail and\nscampered. Billy slid from its back and as he fell he clutched wildly,\ncaught the folded tail, and instinctively clung to it. The turkey gave\none scream and relaxed its muscles. Then it fled in disfigured defeat\nto the haystack. Billy scrambled to his feet holding the tail, while his\neyes were bulging.\n\n“Why, the blasted old thing came off!” he said to Wesley, holding out\nthe tail in amazed wonder.\n\nThe man, caught suddenly, forgot everything and roared. Seeing which,\nBilly thought a turkey tail of no account and flung that one high above\nhim shouting in wild childish laughter, when the feathers scattered and\nfell.\n\nMargaret, watching, began to cry. Wesley had gone mad. For the first\ntime in her married life she wanted to tell her mother. When Wesley had\nwaited until he was so hungry he could wait no longer he invaded the\nkitchen to find a cooked supper baking on the back of the stove, while\nMargaret with red eyes nursed a pair of demoralized white kittens.\n\n“Is supper ready?” he asked.\n\n“It has been for an hour,” answered Margaret.\n\n“Why didn't you call us?”\n\nThat “us” had too much comradeship in it. It irritated Margaret.\n\n“I supposed it would take you even longer than this to fix things decent\nagain. As for my turkey, and my poor little kittens, they don't matter.”\n\n“I am mighty sorry about them, Margaret, you know that. Billy is very\nbright, and he will soon learn----”\n\n“Soon learn!” cried Margaret. “Wesley Sinton, you don't mean to say that\nyou think of keeping that creature here for some time?”\n\n“No, I think of keeping a well-behaved little boy.”\n\nMargaret set the supper on the table. Seeing the old red cloth Wesley\nstared in amazement. Then he understood. Billy capered around in\ndelight.\n\n“Ain't that pretty?” he exulted. “I wish Jimmy and Belle could see. We,\nwhy we ist eat out of our hands or off a old dry goods box, and when we\nfix up a lot, we have newspaper. We ain't ever had a nice red cloth like\nthis.”\n\nWesley looked straight at Margaret, so intently that she turned away,\nher face flushing. He stacked the dictionary and the geography of\nthe world on a chair, and lifted Billy beside him. He heaped a plate\ngenerously, cut the food, put a fork into Billy's little fist, and made\nhim eat slowly and properly. Billy did his best. Occasionally greed\novercame him, and he used his left hand to pop a bite into his mouth\nwith his fingers. These lapses Wesley patiently overlooked, and went on\nwith his general instructions. Luckily Billy did not spill anything\non his clothing or the cloth. After supper Wesley took him to the barn\nwhile he finished the night work. Then he went and sat beside Margaret\non the front porch. Billy appropriated the hammock, and swung by pulling\na rope tied around a tree. The very energy with which he went at the\nwork of swinging himself appealed to Wesley.\n\n“Mercy, but he's an active little body,” he said. “There isn't a lazy\nbone in him. See how he works to pay for his fun.”\n\n“There goes his foot through it!” cried Margaret. “Wesley, he shall not\nruin my hammock.”\n\n“Of course he shan't!” said Wesley. “Wait, Billy, let me show you.”\n\nThereupon he explained to Billy that ladies wearing beautiful white\ndresses sat in hammocks, so little boys must not put their dusty feet in\nthem. Billy immediately sat, and allowed his feet to swing.\n\n“Margaret,” said Wesley after a long silence on the porch, “isn't it\ntrue that if Billy had been a half-starved sore cat, dog, or animal of\nany sort, that you would have pitied, and helped care for it, and been\nglad to see me get any pleasure out of it I could?”\n\n“Yes,” said Margaret coldly.\n\n“But because I brought a child with an immortal soul, there is no\nwelcome.”\n\n“That isn't a child, it's an animal.”\n\n“You just said you would have welcomed an animal.”\n\n“Not a wild one. I meant a tame beast.”\n\n“Billy is not a beast!” said Wesley hotly. “He is a very dear little\nboy. Margaret, you've always done the church-going and Bible reading for\nthis family. How do you reconcile that 'Suffer little children to come\nunto Me' with the way you are treating Billy?”\n\nMargaret arose. “I haven't treated that child. I have only let him\nalone. I can barely hold myself. He needs the hide tanned about off\nhim!”\n\n“If you'd cared to look at his body, you'd know that you couldn't find a\nplace to strike without cutting into a raw spot,” said Wesley. “Besides,\nBilly has not done a thing for which a child should be punished. He is\nonly full of life, no training, and with a boy's love of mischief. He\ndid abuse your kittens, but an hour before I saw him risk his life to\nsave one from being run over. He minds what you tell him, and doesn't\ndo anything he is told not to. He thinks of his brother and sister right\naway when anything pleases him. He took that stinging medicine with the\ngrit of a bulldog. He is just a bully little chap, and I love him.”\n\n“Oh good heavens!” cried Margaret, going into the house as she spoke.\n\nSinton sat still. At last Billy tired of the swing, came to him and\nleaned his slight body against the big knee.\n\n“Am I going to sleep here?” he asked.\n\n“Sure you are!” said Sinton.\n\nBilly swung his feet as he laid across Wesley's knee. “Come on,” said\nWesley, “I must clean you up for bed.”\n\n“You have to be just awful clean here,” announced Billy. “I like to be\nclean, you feel so good, after the hurt is over.”\n\nSinton registered that remark, and worked with especial tenderness as\nhe redressed the ailing places and washed the dust from Billy's feet and\nhands.\n\n“Where can he sleep?” he asked Margaret.\n\n“I'm sure I don't know,” she answered.\n\n“Oh, I can sleep ist any place,” said Billy. “On the floor or anywhere.\nHome, I sleep on pa's coat on a store-box, and Jimmy and Belle they\nsleep on the storebox, too. I sleep between them, so's I don't roll off\nand crack my head. Ain't you got a storebox and a old coat?”\n\nWesley arose and opened a folding lounge. Then he brought an armload of\nclean horse blankets from a closet.\n\n“These don't look like the nice white bed a little boy should have,\nBilly,” he said, “but we'll make them do. This will beat a storebox all\nhollow.”\n\nBilly took a long leap for the lounge. When he found it bounced, he\nproceeded to bounce, until he was tired. By that time the blankets had\nto be refolded. Wesley had Billy take one end and help, while both of\nthem seemed to enjoy the job. Then Billy lay down and curled up in his\nclothes like a small dog. But sleep would not come.\n\nFinally he sat up. He stared around restlessly. Then he arose, went to\nWesley, and leaned against his knee. He picked up the boy and folded his\narms around him. Billy sighed in rapturous content.\n\n“That bed feels so lost like,” he said. “Jimmy always jabbed me on one\nside, and Belle on the other, and so I knew I was there. Do you know\nwhere they are?”\n\n“They are with kind people who gave them a fine supper, a clean bed, and\nwill always take good care of them.”\n\n“I wisht I was--” Billy hesitated and looked earnestly at Wesley. “I\nmean I wish they was here.”\n\n“You are about all I can manage, Billy,” said Wesley.\n\nBilly sat up. “Can't she manage anything?” he asked, waving toward\nMargaret.\n\n“Indeed, yes,” said Wesley. “She has managed me for twenty years.”\n\n“My, but she made you nice!” said Billy. “I just love you. I wisht she'd\ntake Jimmy and Belle and make them nice as you.”\n\n“She isn't strong enough to do that, Billy. They will grow into a good\nboy and girl where they are.”\n\nBilly slid from Wesley's arms and walked toward Margaret until he\nreached the middle of the room. Then he stopped, and at last sat on the\nfloor. Finally he lay down and closed his eyes. “This feels more like my\nbed; if only Jimmy and Belle was here to crowd up a little, so it wasn't\nso alone like.”\n\n“Won't I do, Billy?” asked Wesley in a husky voice.\n\nBilly moved restlessly. “Seems like--seems like toward night as if a\nbody got kind o' lonesome for a woman person--like her.”\n\nBilly indicated Margaret and then closed his eyes so tight his small\nface wrinkled.\n\nSoon he was up again. “Wisht I had Snap,” he said. “Oh, I ist wisht I\nhad Snap!”\n\n“I thought you laid a board on Snap and jumped on it,” said Wesley.\n\n“We did!” cried Billy--“oh, you ought to heard him squeal!” Billy\nlaughed loudly, then his face clouded.\n\n“But I want Snap to lay beside me so bad now--that if he was here I'd\ngive him a piece of my chicken, 'for, I ate any. Do you like dogs?”\n\n“Yes, I do,” said Wesley.\n\nBilly was up instantly. “Would you like Snap?”\n\n“I am sure I would,” said Wesley.\n\n“Would she?” Billy indicated Margaret. And then he answered his own\nquestion. “But of course, she wouldn't, cos she likes cats, and dogs\nchases cats. Oh, dear, I thought for a minute maybe Snap could come\nhere.” Billy lay down and closed his eyes resolutely.\n\nSuddenly they flew open. “Does it hurt to be dead?” he demanded.\n\n“Nothing hurts you after you are dead, Billy,” said Wesley.\n\n“Yes, but I mean does it hurt getting to be dead?”\n\n“Sometimes it does. It did not hurt your father, Billy. It came softly\nwhile he was asleep.”\n\n“It ist came softly?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I kind o' wisht he wasn't dead!” said Billy. “'Course I like to\nstay with you, and the fried chicken, and the nice soft bed, and--and\neverything, and I like to be clean, but he took us to the show, and he\ngot us gum, and he never hurt us when he wasn't drunk.”\n\nBilly drew a deep breath, and tightly closed his eyes. But very soon\nthey opened. Then he sat up. He looked at Wesley pitifully, and then he\nglanced at Margaret. “You don't like boys, do you?” he questioned.\n\n“I like good boys,” said Margaret.\n\nBilly was at her knee instantly. “Well say, I'm a good boy!” he\nannounced joyously.\n\n“I do not think boys who hurt helpless kittens and pull out turkeys'\ntails are good boys.”\n\n“Yes, but I didn't hurt the kittens,” explained Billy. “They got mad\n'bout ist a little fun and scratched each other. I didn't s'pose they'd\nact like that. And I didn't pull the turkey's tail. I ist held on to the\nfirst thing I grabbed, and the turkey pulled. Honest, it was the turkey\npulled.” He turned to Wesley. “You tell her! Didn't the turkey pull? I\ndidn't know its tail was loose, did I?”\n\n“I don't think you did, Billy,” said Wesley.\n\nBilly stared into Margaret's cold face. “Sometimes at night, Belle sits\non the floor, and I lay my head in her lap. I could pull up a chair and\nlay my head in your lap. Like this, I mean.” Billy pulled up a chair,\nclimbed on it and laid his head on Margaret's lap. Then he shut his eyes\nagain. Margaret could have looked little more repulsed if he had been a\nsnake. Billy was soon up.\n\n“My, but your lap is hard,” he said. “And you are a good deal fatter 'an\nBelle, too!” He slid from the chair and came back to the middle of the\nroom.\n\n“Oh but I wisht he wasn't dead!” he cried. The flood broke and Billy\nscreamed in desperation.\n\nOut of the night a soft, warm young figure flashed through the door and\nwith a swoop caught him in her arms. She dropped into a chair, nestled\nhim closely, drooped her fragrant brown head over his little bullet-eyed\nred one, and rocked softly while she crooned over him--\n\n     “Billy, boy, where have you been?\n     Oh, I have been to seek a wife,\n     She's the joy of my life,\n     But then she's a young thing and she can't leave her mammy!”\n\nBilly clung to her frantically. Elnora wiped his eyes, kissed his face,\nswayed and sang.\n\n“Why aren't you asleep?” she asked at last.\n\n“I don't know,” said Billy. “I tried. I tried awful hard cos I thought\nhe wanted me to, but it ist wouldn't come. Please tell her I tried.” He\nappealed to Margaret.\n\n“He did try to go to sleep,” admitted Margaret.\n\n“Maybe he can't sleep in his clothes,” suggested Elnora. “Haven't you an\nold dressing sacque? I could roll the sleeves.”\n\nMargaret got an old sacque, and Elnora put it on Billy. Then she brought\na basin of water and bathed his face and head. She gathered him up and\nbegan to rock again.\n\n“Have you got a pa?” asked Billy.\n\n“No,” said Elnora.\n\n“Is he dead like mine?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Did it hurt him to die?”\n\n“I don't know.”\n\nBilly was wide awake again. “It didn't hurt my pa,” he boasted; “he ist\ndied while he was asleep. He didn't even know it was coming.”\n\n“I am glad of that,” said Elnora, pressing the small head against her\nbreast again.\n\nBilly escaped her hand and sat up. “I guess I won't go to sleep,” he\nsaid. “It might 'come softly' and get me.”\n\n“It won't get you, Billy,” said Elnora, rocking and singing between\nsentences. “It doesn't get little boys. It just takes big people who are\nsick.”\n\n“Was my pa sick?”\n\n“Yes,” said Elnora. “He had a dreadful sickness inside him that burned,\nand made him drink things. That was why he would forget his little boys\nand girl. If he had been well, he would have gotten you good things to\neat, clean clothes, and had the most fun with you.”\n\nBilly leaned against her and closed his eyes, and Elnora rocked\nhopefully.\n\n“If I was dead would you cry?” he was up again.\n\n“Yes, I would,” said Elnora, gripping him closer until Billy almost\nsquealed with the embrace.\n\n“Do you love me tight as that?” he questioned blissfully.\n\n“Yes, bushels and bushels,” said Elnora. “Better than any little boy in\nthe whole world.”\n\nBilly looked at Margaret. “She don't!” he said. “She'd be glad if it\nwould get me 'softly,' right now. She don't want me here 't all.”\n\nElnora smothered his face against her breast and rocked.\n\n“You love me, don't you?”\n\n“I will, if you will go to sleep.”\n\n“Every single day you will give me your dinner for the bologna, won't\nyou,” said Billy.\n\n“Yes, I will,” replied Elnora. “But you will have as good lunch as I do\nafter this. You will have milk, eggs, chicken, all kinds of good things,\nlittle pies, and cakes, maybe.”\n\nBilly shook his head. “I am going back home soon as it is light,” he\nsaid, “she don't want me. She thinks I'm a bad boy. She's going to whip\nme--if he lets her. She said so. I heard her. Oh, I wish he hadn't died!\nI want to go home.” Billy shrieked again.\n\nMrs. Comstock had started to walk slowly to meet Elnora. The girl had\nbeen so late that her mother reached the Sinton gate and followed the\npath until the picture inside became visible. Elnora had told her about\nWesley taking Billy home. Mrs. Comstock had some curiosity to see how\nMargaret bore the unexpected addition to her family. Billy's voice,\nraised with excitement, was plainly audible. She could see Elnora\nholding him, and hear his excited wail. Wesley's face was drawn and\nhaggard, and Margaret's set and defiant. A very imp of perversity\nentered the breast of Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“Hoity, toity!” she said as she suddenly appeared in the door. “Blest if\nI ever heard a man making sounds like that before!”\n\nBilly ceased suddenly. Mrs. Comstock was tall, angular, and her hair was\nprematurely white. She was only thirty-six, although she appeared fifty.\nBut there was an expression on her usually cold face that was attractive\njust then, and Billy was in search of attractions.\n\n“Have I stayed too late, mother?” asked Elnora anxiously. “I truly\nintended to come straight back, but I thought I could rock Billy to\nsleep first. Everything is strange, and he's so nervous.”\n\n“Is that your ma?” demanded Billy.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Does she love you?”\n\n“Of course!”\n\n“My mother didn't love me,” said Billy. “She went away and left me, and\nnever came back. She don't care what happens to me. You wouldn't go away\nand leave your little girl, would you?” questioned Billy.\n\n“No,” said Katharine Comstock, “and I wouldn't leave a little boy,\neither.”\n\nBilly began sliding from Elnora's knees.\n\n“Do you like boys?” he questioned.\n\n“If there is anything I love it is a boy,” said Mrs. Comstock\nassuringly. Billy was on the floor.\n\n“Do you like dogs?”\n\n“Yes. Almost as well as boys. I am going to buy a dog as soon as I can\nfind a good one.”\n\nBilly swept toward her with a whoop.\n\n“Do you want a boy?” he shouted.\n\nKatharine Comstock stretched out her arms, and gathered him in.\n\n“Of course, I want a boy!” she rejoiced.\n\n“Maybe you'd like to have me?” offered Billy.\n\n“Sure I would,” triumphed Mrs. Comstock. “Any one would like to have\nyou. You are just a real boy, Billy.”\n\n“Will you take Snap?”\n\n“I'd like to have Snap almost as well as you.”\n\n“Mother!” breathed Elnora imploringly. “Don't! Oh, don't! He thinks you\nmean it!”\n\n“And so I do mean it,” said Mrs. Comstock. “I'll take him in a jiffy. I\nthrow away enough to feed a little tyke like him every day. His chatter\nwould be great company while you are gone. Blood soon can be purified\nwith right food and baths, and as for Snap, I meant to buy a bulldog,\nbut possibly Snap will serve just as well. All I ask of a dog is to bark\nat the right time. I'll do the rest. Would you like to come and be my\nboy, Billy?”\n\nBilly leaned against Mrs. Comstock, reached his arms around her neck and\ngripped her with all his puny might. “You can whip me all you want to,”\n he said. “I won't make a sound.”\n\nMrs. Comstock held him closely and her hard face was softening; of that\nthere could be no doubt.\n\n“Now, why would any one whip a nice little boy like you?” she asked\nwonderingly.\n\n“She”--Billy from his refuge waved toward Margaret--“she was going to\nwhip me 'cause her cats fought, when I tied their tails together and\nhung them over the line to dry. How did I know her old cats would\nfight?”\n\nMrs. Comstock began to laugh suddenly, and try as she would she could\nnot stop so soon as she desired. Billy studied her.\n\n“Have you got turkeys?” he demanded.\n\n“Yes, flocks of them,” said Mrs. Comstock, vainly struggling to suppress\nher mirth, and settle her face in its accustomed lines.\n\n“Are their tails fast?” demanded Billy.\n\n“Why, I think so,” marvelled Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“Hers ain't!” said Billy with the wave toward Margaret that was becoming\nfamiliar. “Her turkey pulled, and its tail comed right off. She's going\nto whip me if he lets her. I didn't know the turkey would pull. I didn't\nknow its tail would come off. I won't ever touch one again, will I?”\n\n“Of course, you won't,” said Mrs. Comstock. “And what's more, I don't\ncare if you do! I'd rather have a fine little man like you than all the\nturkeys in the country. Let them lose their old tails if they want to,\nand let the cats fight. Cats and turkeys don't compare with boys, who\nare going to be fine big men some of these days.”\n\nThen Billy and Mrs. Comstock hugged each other rapturously, while their\naudience stared in silent amazement.\n\n“You like boys!” exulted Billy, and his head dropped against Mrs.\nComstock in unspeakable content.\n\n“Yes, and if I don't have to carry you the whole way home, we must start\nright now,” said Mrs. Comstock. “You are going to be asleep before you\nknow it.”\n\nBilly opened his eyes and braced himself. “I can walk,” he said proudly.\n\n“All right, we must start. Come, Elnora! Good-night, folks!” Mrs.\nComstock set Billy on the floor, and arose gripping his hand. “You take\nthe other side, Elnora, and we will help him as much as we can,” she\nsaid.\n\nElnora stared piteously at Margaret, then at Wesley, and arose in\nwhite-faced bewilderment.\n\n“Billy, are you going to leave without even saying good-bye to me?”\n asked Wesley, with a gulp.\n\nBilly held tight to Mrs. Comstock and Elnora.\n\n“Good-bye!” he said casually. “I'll come and see you some time.”\n\nWesley Sinton gave a smothered sob, and strode from the room.\n\nMrs. Comstock started toward the door, dragging at Billy while Elnora\npulled back, but Mrs. Sinton was before them, her eyes flashing.\n\n“Kate Comstock, you think you are mighty smart, don't you?” she cried.\n\n“I ain't in the lunatic asylum, where you belong, anyway,” said Mrs.\nComstock. “I am smart enough to tell a dandy boy when I see him, and I'm\ngood and glad to get him. I'll love to have him!”\n\n“Well, you won't have him!” exclaimed Margaret Sinton. “That boy is\nWesley's! He found him, and brought him here. You can't come in and take\nhim like that! Let go of him!”\n\n“Not much, I won't!” cried Mrs. Comstock. “Leave the poor sick little\nsoul here for you to beat, because he didn't know just how to handle\nthings! Of course, he'll make mistakes. He must have a lot of teaching,\nbut not the kind he'll get from you! Clear out of my way!”\n\n“You let go of our boy,” ordered Margaret.\n\n“Why? Do you want to whip him, before he can go to sleep?” jeered Mrs.\nComstock.\n\n“No, I don't!” said Margaret. “He's Wesley's, and nobody shall touch\nhim. Wesley!”\n\nWesley Sinton appeared behind Margaret in the doorway, and she turned to\nhim. “Make Kate Comstock let go of our boy!” she demanded.\n\n“Billy, she wants you now,” said Wesley Sinton. “She won't whip you, and\nshe won't let any one else. You can have stacks of good things to eat,\nride in the carriage, and have a great time. Won't you stay with us?”\n\nBilly drew away from Mrs. Comstock and Elnora.\n\nHe faced Margaret, his eyes shrewd with unchildish wisdom. Necessity had\ntaught him to strike the hot iron, to drive the hard bargain.\n\n“Can I have Snap to live here always?” he demanded.\n\n“Yes, you can have all the dogs you want,” said Margaret Sinton.\n\n“Can I sleep close enough so's I can touch you?”\n\n“Yes, you can move your lounge up so that you can hold my hand,” said\nMargaret.\n\n“Do you love me now?” questioned Billy.\n\n“I'll try to love you, if you are a good boy,” said Margaret.\n\n“Then I guess I'll stay,” said Billy, walking over to her.\n\nOut in the night Elnora and her mother went down the road in the\nmoonlight; every few rods Mrs. Comstock laughed aloud.\n\n“Mother, I don't understand you,” sobbed Elnora.\n\n“Well, maybe when you have gone to high school longer you will,” said\nMrs. Comstock. “Anyway, you saw me bring Mag Sinton to her senses,\ndidn't you?”\n\n“Yes, I did,” answered Elnora, “but I thought you were in earnest. So\ndid Billy, and Uncle Wesley, and Aunt Margaret.”\n\n“Well, wasn't I?” inquired Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“But you just said you brought Aunt Margaret to!”\n\n“Well, didn't I?”\n\n“I don't understand you.”\n\n“That's the reason I am recommending more schooling!”\n\nElnora took her candle and went to bed. Mrs. Comstock was feeling too\ngood to sleep. Twice of late she really had enjoyed herself for the\nfirst in sixteen years, and greediness for more of the same feeling\ncrept into her blood like intoxication. As she sat brooding alone she\nknew the truth. She would have loved to have taken Billy. She would not\nhave minded his mischief, his chatter, or his dog. He would have meant\na distraction from herself that she greatly needed; she was even sincere\nabout the dog. She had intended to tell Wesley to buy her one at the\nvery first opportunity. Her last thought was of Billy. She chuckled\nsoftly, for she was not saintly, and now she knew how she could even a\nlong score with Margaret and Wesley in a manner that would fill her soul\nwith grim satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nWHEREIN THE LIMBERLOST TEMPTS ELNORA, AND BILLY BURIES HIS FATHER\n\n\nImmediately after dinner on Sunday Wesley Sinton stopped at the Comstock\ngate to ask if Elnora wanted to go to town with them. Billy sat beside\nhim and he did not appear as if he were on his way to a funeral. Elnora\nsaid she had to study and could not go, but she suggested that her\nmother take her place. Mrs. Comstock put on her hat and went at once,\nwhich surprised Elnora. She did not know that her mother was anxious\nfor an opportunity to speak with Sinton alone. Elnora knew why she\nwas repeatedly cautioned not to leave their land, if she went specimen\nhunting.\n\nShe studied two hours and was several lessons ahead of her classes.\nThere was no use to go further. She would take a walk and see if she\ncould gather any caterpillars or find any freshly spun cocoons. She\nsearched the bushes and low trees behind the garden and all around the\nedge of the woods on their land, and having little success, at last\ncame to the road. Almost the first thorn bush she examined yielded a\nPolyphemus cocoon. Elnora lifted her head with the instinct of a hunter\non the chase, and began work. She reached the swamp before she knew\nit, carrying five fine cocoons of different species as her reward. She\npushed back her hair and gazed around longingly. A few rods inside she\nthought she saw cocoons on a bush, to which she went, and found several.\nSense of caution was rapidly vanishing; she was in a fair way to\nforget everything and plunge into the swamp when she thought she heard\nfootsteps coming down the trail. She went back, and came out almost\nfacing Pete Corson.\n\nThat ended her difficulty. She had known him since childhood. When she\nsat on the front bench of the Brushwood schoolhouse, Pete had been one\nof the big boys at the back of the room. He had been rough and wild,\nbut she never had been afraid of him, and often he had given her pretty\nthings from the swamp.\n\n“What luck!” she cried. “I promised mother I would not go inside the\nswamp alone, and will you look at the cocoons I've found! There are more\njust screaming for me to come get them, because the leaves will fall\nwith the first frost, and then the jays and crows will begin to tear\nthem open. I haven't much time, since I'm going to school. You will go\nwith me, Pete! Please say yes! Just a little way!”\n\n“What are those things?” asked the man, his keen black eyes staring at\nher.\n\n“They are the cases these big caterpillars spin for winter, and in the\nspring they come out great night moths, and I can sell them. Oh, Pete, I\ncan sell them for enough to take me through high school and dress me\nso like the others that I don't look different, and if I have very good\nluck I can save some for college. Pete, please go with me?”\n\n“Why don't you go like you always have?”\n\n“Well, the truth is, I had a little scare,” said Elnora. “I never did\nmean to go alone; sometimes I sort of wandered inside farther than I\nintended, chasing things. You know Duncan gave me Freckles's books, and\nI have been gathering moths like he did. Lately I found I could sell\nthem. If I can make a complete collection, I can get three hundred\ndollars for it. Three such collections would take me almost through\ncollege, and I've four years in the high school yet. That's a long time.\nI might collect them.”\n\n“Can every kind there is be found here?”\n\n“No, not all of them, but when I get more than I need of one kind, I\ncan trade them with collectors farther north and west, so I can complete\nsets. It's the only way I see to earn the money. Look what I have\nalready. Big gray Cecropias come from this kind; brown Polyphemus from\nthat, and green Lunas from these. You aren't working on Sunday. Go with\nme only an hour, Pete!”\n\nThe man looked at her narrowly. She was young, wholesome, and beautiful.\nShe was innocent, intensely in earnest, and she needed the money, he\nknew that.\n\n“You didn't tell me what scared you,” he said.\n\n“Oh, I thought I did! Why you know I had Freckles's box packed full of\nmoths and specimens, and one evening I sold some to the Bird Woman. Next\nmorning I found a note telling me it wasn't safe to go inside the swamp.\nThat sort of scared me. I think I'll go alone, rather than miss the\nchance, but I'd be so happy if you would take care of me. Then I could\ngo anywhere I chose, because if I mired you could pull me out. You will\ntake care of me, Pete?”\n\n“Yes, I'll take care of you,” promised Pete Corson.\n\n“Goody!” said Elnora. “Let's start quick! And Pete, you look at these\nclosely, and when you are hunting or going along the road, if one\ndangles under your nose, you cut off the little twig and save it for me,\nwill you?”\n\n“Yes, I'll save you all I see,” promised Pete. He pushed back his\nhat and followed Elnora. She plunged fearlessly among bushes, over\nunderbrush, and across dead logs. One minute she was crying wildly, that\nhere was a big one, the next she was reaching for a limb above her head\nor on her knees overturning dead leaves under a hickory or oak tree, or\nworking aside black muck with her bare hands as she searched for buried\npupae cases. For the first hour Pete bent back bushes and followed,\ncarrying what Elnora discovered. Then he found one.\n\n“Is this the kind of thing you are looking for?” he asked bashfully, as\nhe presented a wild cherry twig.\n\n“Oh Pete, that's a Promethea! I didn't even hope to find one.”\n\n“What's the bird like?” asked Pete.\n\n“Almost black wings,” said Elnora, “with clay-coloured edges, and the\nmost wonderful wine-coloured flush over the under side if it's a male,\nand stronger wine above and below if it's a female. Oh, aren't I happy!”\n\n“How would it do to make what you have into a bunch that we could leave\nhere, and come back for them?”\n\n“That would be all right.”\n\nRelieved of his load Pete began work. First, he narrowly examined the\ncocoons Elnora had found. He questioned her as to what other kinds would\nbe like. He began to use the eyes of a trained woodman and hunter in\nher behalf. He saw several so easily, and moved through the forest so\nsoftly, that Elnora forgot the moths in watching him. Presently she was\ncarrying the specimens, and he was making the trips of investigation to\nsee which was a cocoon and which a curled leaf, or he was on his knees\ndigging around stumps. As he worked he kept asking questions. What\nkind of logs were best to look beside, what trees were pupae cases\nmost likely to be under; on what bushes did caterpillars spin most\nfrequently? Time passed, as it always does when one's occupation is\nabsorbing.\n\nWhen the Sintons took Mrs. Comstock home, they stopped to see Elnora.\nShe was not there. Mrs. Comstock called at the edge of her woods and\nreceived no reply. Then Wesley turned and drove back to the Limberlost.\nHe left Margaret and Mrs. Comstock holding the team and entertaining\nBilly, while he entered the swamp.\n\nElnora and Pete had made a wide trail behind them. Before Sinton had\nthought of calling, he heard voices and approached with some caution.\nSoon he saw Elnora, her flushed face beaming as she bent with an armload\nof twigs and branches and talked to a kneeling man.\n\n“Now go cautiously!” she was saying. “I am just sure we will find an\nImperialis here. It's their very kind of a place. There! What did I tell\nyou! Isn't that splendid? Oh, I am so glad you came with me!”\n\nWesley stood staring in speechless astonishment, for the man had arisen,\nbrushed the dirt from his hands, and held out to Elnora a small shining\ndark pupa case. As his face came into view Sinton almost cried out, for\nhe was the one man of all others Wesley knew with whom he most feared\nfor Elnora's safety. She had him on his knees digging pupae cases for\nher from the swamp.\n\n“Elnora!” called Sinton. “Elnora!”\n\n“Oh, Uncle Wesley!” cried the girl. “See what luck we've had! I know we\nhave a dozen and a half cocoons and we have three pupae cases. It's much\nharder to get the cases because you have to dig for them, and you can't\nsee where to look. But Pete is fine at it! He's found three, and he\nsays he will keep watch beside the roads, and through the woods while he\nhunts. Isn't that splendid of him? Uncle Wesley, there is a college over\nthere on the western edge of the swamp. Look closely, and you can see\nthe great dome up among the clouds.”\n\n“I should say you have had luck,” said Wesley, striving to make his\nvoice natural. “But I thought you were not coming to the swamp?”\n\n“Well, I wasn't,” said Elnora, “but I couldn't find many anywhere else,\nhonest, I couldn't, and just as soon as I came to the edge I began to\nsee them here. I kept my promise. I didn't come in alone. Pete came\nwith me. He's so strong, he isn't afraid of anything, and he's perfectly\nsplendid to locate cocoons! He's found half of these. Come on, Pete,\nit's getting dark now, and we must go.”\n\nThey started toward the trail, Pete carrying the cocoons. He left them\nat the case, while Elnora and Wesley went on to the carriage together.\n\n“Elnora Comstock, what does this mean?” demanded her mother.\n\n“It's all right, one of the neighbours was with her, and she got several\ndollars' worth of stuff,” interposed Wesley.\n\n“You oughter seen my pa,” shouted Billy. “He was ist all whited out, and\nhe laid as still as anything. They put him away deep in the ground.”\n\n“Billy!” breathed Margaret in a prolonged groan.\n\n“Jimmy and Belle are going to be together in a nice place. They are\ncoming to see me, and Snap is right down here by the wheel. Here, Snap!\nMy, but he'll be tickled to get something to eat! He's 'most twisted\nas me. They get new clothes, and all they want to eat, too, but they'll\nmiss me. They couldn't have got along without me. I took care of them.\nI had a lot of things give to me 'cause I was the littlest, and I always\ndivided with them. But they won't need me now.”\n\nWhen she left the carriage Mrs. Comstock gravely shook hands with Billy.\n“Remember,” she said to him, “I love boys, and I love dogs. Whenever you\ndon't have a good time up there, take your dog and come right down and\nbe my little boy. We will just have loads of fun. You should hear the\nwhistles I can make. If you aren't treated right you come straight to\nme.”\n\nBilly wagged his head sagely. “You ist bet I will!” he said.\n\n“Mother, how could you?” asked Elnora as they walked up the path.\n\n“How could I, missy? You better ask how couldn't I? I just couldn't! Not\nfor enough to pay, my road tax! Not for enough to pay the road tax, and\nthe dredge tax, too!”\n\n“Aunt Margaret always has been lovely to me, and I don't think it's fair\nto worry her.”\n\n“I choose to be lovely to Billy, and let her sweat out her own worries\njust as she has me, these sixteen years. There is nothing in all this\nworld so good for people as taking a dose of their own medicine. The\ndifference is that I am honest. I just say in plain English, 'if they\ndon't treat you right, come to me.' They have only said it in actions\nand inferences. I want to teach Mag Sinton how her own doses taste, but\nshe begins to sputter before I fairly get the spoon to her lips. Just\nyou wait!”\n\n“When I think what I owe her----” began Elnora.\n\n“Well, thank goodness, I don't owe her anything, and so I'm perfectly\nfree to do what I choose. Come on, and help me get supper. I'm hungry as\nBilly!”\n\nMargaret Sinton rocked slowly back and forth in her chair. On her breast\nlay Billy's red head, one hand clutched her dress front with spasmodic\ngrip, even after he was unconscious.\n\n“You mustn't begin that, Margaret,” said Sinton. “He's too heavy. And\nit's bad for him. He's better off to lie down and go to sleep alone.”\n\n“He's very light, Wesley. He jumps and quivers so. He has to be stronger\nthan he is now, before he will sleep soundly.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nWHEREIN ELNORA DISCOVERS A VIOLIN, AND BILLY DISCIPLINES MARGARET\n\n\nElnora missed the little figure at the bridge the following morning. She\nslowly walked up the street and turned in at the wide entrance to the\nschool grounds. She scarcely could comprehend that only a week ago she\nhad gone there friendless, alone, and so sick at heart that she was\nphysically ill. To-day she had decent clothing, books, friends, and her\nmind was at ease to work on her studies.\n\nAs she approached home that night the girl paused in amazement. Her\nmother had company, and she was laughing. Elnora entered the kitchen\nsoftly and peeped into the sitting-room. Mrs. Comstock sat in her chair\nholding a book and every few seconds a soft chuckle broke into a real\nlaugh. Mark Twain was doing his work; while Mrs. Comstock was not\nlacking in a sense of humour. Elnora entered the room before her mother\nsaw her. Mrs. Comstock looked up with flushed face.\n\n“Where did you get this?” she demanded.\n\n“I bought it,” said Elnora.\n\n“Bought it! With all the taxes due!”\n\n“I paid for it out of my Indian money, mother,” said Elnora. “I couldn't\nbear to spend so much on myself and nothing at all on you. I was afraid\nto buy the dress I should have liked to, and I thought the book would be\ncompany, while I was gone. I haven't read it, but I do hope it's good.”\n\n“Good! It's the biggest piece of foolishness I have read in all my life.\nI've laughed all day, ever since I found it. I had a notion to go out\nand read some of it to the cows and see if they wouldn't laugh.”\n\n“If it made you laugh, it's a wise book,” said Elnora.\n\n“Wise!” cried Mrs. Comstock. “You can stake your life it's a wise book.\nIt takes the smartest man there is to do this kind of fooling,” and she\nbegan laughing again.\n\nElnora, highly satisfied with her purchase, went to her room and put on\nher working clothes. Thereafter she made a point of bringing a book that\nshe thought would interest her mother, from the library every week, and\nleaving it on the sitting-room table. Each night she carried home at\nleast two school books and studied until she had mastered the points\nof her lessons. She did her share of the work faithfully, and every\navailable minute she was in the fields searching for cocoons, for the\nmoths promised to become her largest source of income.\n\nShe gathered baskets of nests, flowers, mosses, insects, and all sorts\nof natural history specimens and sold them to the grade teachers. At\nfirst she tried to tell these instructors what to teach their pupils\nabout the specimens; but recognizing how much more she knew than they,\none after another begged her to study at home, and use her spare hours\nin school to exhibit and explain nature subjects to their pupils. Elnora\nloved the work, and she needed the money, for every few days some matter\nof expense arose that she had not expected.\n\nFrom the first week she had been received and invited with the crowd\nof girls in her class, and it was their custom in passing through the\nbusiness part of the city to stop at the confectioners' and take turns\nin treating to expensive candies, ice cream sodas, hot chocolate, or\nwhatever they fancied. When first Elnora was asked she accepted without\nunderstanding. The second time she went because she seldom had tasted\nthese things, and they were so delicious she could not resist. After\nthat she went because she knew all about it, and had decided to go.\n\nShe had spent half an hour on the log beside the trail in deep thought\nand had arrived at her conclusions. She worked harder than usual for the\nnext week, but she seemed to thrive on work. It was October and the\nred leaves were falling when her first time came to treat. As the crowd\nflocked down the broad walk that night Elnora called, “Girls, it's my\ntreat to-night! Come on!”\n\nShe led the way through the city to the grocery they patronized when\nthey had a small spread, and entering came out with a basket, which she\ncarried to the bridge on her home road. There she arranged the girls\nin two rows on the cement abutments and opening her basket she gravely\noffered each girl an exquisite little basket of bark, lined with red\nleaves, in one end of which nestled a juicy big red apple and in the\nother a spicy doughnut not an hour from Margaret Sinton's frying basket.\n\nAnother time she offered big balls of popped corn stuck together with\nmaple sugar, and liberally sprinkled with beechnut kernels. Again it\nwas hickory-nut kernels glazed with sugar, another time maple candy,\nand once a basket of warm pumpkin pies. She never made any apology,\nor offered any excuse. She simply gave what she could afford, and the\nchange was as welcome to those city girls accustomed to sodas and French\ncandy, as were these same things to Elnora surfeited on popcorn and pie.\nIn her room was a little slip containing a record of the number of weeks\nin the school year, the times it would be her turn to treat and the\ndates on which such occasions would fall, with a number of suggestions\nbeside each. Once the girls almost fought over a basket lined with\nyellow leaves, and filled with fat, very ripe red haws. In late October\nthere was a riot over one which was lined with red leaves and contained\nbig fragrant pawpaws frost-bitten to a perfect degree. Then hazel\nnuts were ripe, and once they served. One day Elnora at her wits' end,\nexplained to her mother that the girls had given her things and she\nwanted to treat them. Mrs. Comstock, with characteristic stubbornness,\nhad said she would leave a basket at the grocery for her, but firmly\ndeclined to say what would be in it. All day Elnora struggled to keep\nher mind on her books. For hours she wavered in tense uncertainty. What\nwould her mother do? Should she take the girls to the confectioner's\nthat night or risk the basket? Mrs. Comstock could make delicious things\nto eat, but would she?\n\nAs they left the building Elnora made a final rapid mental calculation.\nShe could not see her way clear to a decent treat for ten people for\nless than two dollars and if the basket proved to be nice, then the\nmoney would be wasted. She decided to risk it. As they went to the\nbridge the girls were betting on what the treat would be, and crowding\nnear Elnora like spoiled small children. Elnora set down the basket.\n\n“Girls,” she said, “I don't know what this is myself, so all of us are\ngoing to be surprised. Here goes!”\n\nShe lifted the cover and perfumes from the land of spices rolled up. In\none end of the basket lay ten enormous sugar cakes the tops of which had\nbeen liberally dotted with circles cut from stick candy. The candy had\nmelted in baking and made small transparent wells of waxy sweetness\nand in the centre of each cake was a fat turtle made from a raisin with\ncloves for head and feet. The remainder of the basket was filled with\nbig spiced pears that could be held by their stems while they were\neaten. The girls shrieked and attacked the cookies, and of all the\ntreats Elnora offered perhaps none was quite so long remembered as that.\n\nWhen Elnora took her basket, placed her books in it, and started home,\nall the girls went with her as far as the fence where she crossed the\nfield to the swamp. At parting they kissed her good-bye. Elnora was a\nhappy girl as she hurried home to thank her mother. She was happy over\nher books that night, and happy all the way to school the following\nmorning.\n\nWhen the music swelled from the orchestra her heart almost broke with\nthrobbing joy. For music always had affected her strangely, and since\nshe had been comfortable enough in her surroundings to notice things,\nshe had listened to every note to find what it was that literally hurt\nher heart, and at last she knew. It was the talking of the violins.\nThey were human voices, and they spoke a language Elnora understood. It\nseemed to her that she must climb up on the stage, take the instruments\nfrom the fingers of the players and make them speak what was in her\nheart.\n\nThat night she said to her mother, “I am perfectly crazy for a violin. I\nam sure I could play one, sure as I live. Did any one----” Elnora never\ncompleted that sentence.\n\n“Hush!” thundered Mrs. Comstock. “Be quiet! Never mention those things\nbefore me again--never as long as you live! I loathe them! They are a\nsnare of the very devil himself! They were made to lure men and women\nfrom their homes and their honour. If ever I see you with one in your\nfingers I will smash it in pieces.”\n\nNaturally Elnora hushed, but she thought of nothing else after she had\nfinished her lessons. At last there came a day when for some reason the\nleader of the orchestra left his violin on the grand piano. That morning\nElnora made her first mistake in algebra. At noon, as soon as the\nbuilding was empty, she slipped into the auditorium, found the side door\nwhich led to the stage, and going through the musicians' entrance she\ntook the violin. She carried it back into the little side room where the\norchestra assembled, closed all the doors, opened the case and lifted\nout the instrument.\n\nShe laid it on her breast, dropped her chin on it and drew the bow\nsoftly across the strings. One after another she tested the open notes.\nGradually her stroke ceased to tremble and she drew the bow firmly. Then\nher fingers began to fall and softly, slowly she searched up and down\nthose strings for sounds she knew. Standing in the middle of the floor,\nshe tried over and over. It seemed scarcely a minute before the hall was\nfilled with the sound of hurrying feet, and she was forced to put away\nthe violin and go to her classes. The next day she prayed that the\nviolin would be left again, but her petition was not answered. That\nnight when she returned from the school she made an excuse to go down\nto see Billy. He was engaged in hulling walnuts by driving them through\nholes in a board. His hands were protected by a pair of Margaret's old\ngloves, but he had speckled his face generously. He appeared well, and\ngreeted Elnora hilariously.\n\n“Me an' the squirrels are laying up our winter stores,” he shouted. “Cos\nthe cold is coming, an' the snow an' if we have any nuts we have to fix\n'em now. But I'm ahead, cos Uncle Wesley made me this board, and I\ncan hull a big pile while the old squirrel does only ist one with his\nteeth.”\n\nElnora picked him up and kissed him. “Billy, are you happy?” she asked.\n\n“Yes, and so's Snap,” answered Billy. “You ought to see him make the\ndirt fly when he gets after a chipmunk. I bet you he could dig up pa, if\nanybody wanted him to.”\n\n“Billy!” gasped Margaret as she came out to them.\n\n“Well, me and Snap don't want him up, and I bet you Jimmy and Belle\ndon't, either. I ain't been twisty inside once since I been here, and I\ndon't want to go away, and Snap don't, either. He told me so.”\n\n“Billy! That is not true. Dogs can't talk,” cautioned Margaret.\n\n“Then what makes you open the door when he asks you to?” demanded Billy.\n\n“Scratching and whining isn't talking.”\n\n“Anyway, it's the best Snap can talk, and you get up and do things he\nwants done. Chipmunks can talk too. You ought to hear them damn things\nholler when Snap gets them!”\n\n“Billy! When you want a cooky for supper and I don't give it to you it\nis because you said a wrong word.”\n\n“Well, for----” Billy clapped his hand over his mouth and stained his\nface in swipes. “Well, for--anything! Did I go an' forget again! The\ncookies will get all hard, won't they? I bet you ten dollars I don't say\nthat any more.”\n\nHe espied Wesley and ran to show him a walnut too big to go through the\nholes, and Elnora and Margaret entered the house.\n\nThey talked of many things for a time and then Elnora said suddenly:\n“Aunt Margaret, I like music.”\n\n“I've noticed that in you all your life,” answered Margaret.\n\n“If dogs can't talk, I can make a violin talk,” announced Elnora, and\nthen in amazement watched the face of Margaret Sinton grow pale.\n\n“A violin!” she wavered. “Where did you get a violin?”\n\n“They fairly seemed to speak to me in the orchestra. One day the\nconductor left his in the auditorium, and I took it, and Aunt Margaret,\nI can make it do the wind in the swamp, the birds, and the animals. I\ncan make any sound I ever heard on it. If I had a chance to practise a\nlittle, I could make it do the orchestra music, too. I don't know how I\nknow, but I do.”\n\n“Did--did you ever mention it to your mother?” faltered Margaret.\n\n“Yes, and she seems prejudiced against them. But oh, Aunt Margaret, I\nnever felt so about anything, not even going to school. I just feel as\nif I'd die if I didn't have one. I could keep it at school, and practise\nat noon a whole hour. Soon they'd ask me to play in the orchestra. I\ncould keep it in the case and practise in the woods in summer. You'd let\nme play over here Sunday. Oh, Aunt Margaret, what does one cost? Would\nit be wicked for me to take of my money, and buy a very cheap one? I\ncould play on the least expensive one made.”\n\n“Oh, no you couldn't! A cheap machine makes cheap music. You got to have\na fine fiddle to make it sing. But there's no sense in your buying one.\nThere isn't a decent reason on earth why you shouldn't have your fa----”\n\n“My father's!” cried Elnora. She caught Margaret Sinton by the arm. “My\nfather had a violin! He played it. That's why I can! Where is it! Is it\nin our house? Is it in mother's room?”\n\n“Elnora!” panted Margaret. “Your mother will kill me! She always hated\nit.”\n\n“Mother dearly loves music,” said Elnora.\n\n“Not when it took the man she loved away from her to make it!”\n\n“Where is my father's violin?”\n\n“Elnora!”\n\n“I've never seen a picture of my father. I've never heard his name\nmentioned. I've never had a scrap that belonged to him. Was he my\nfather, or am I a charity child like Billy, and so she hates me?”\n\n“She has good pictures of him. Seems she just can't bear to hear him\ntalked about. Of course, he was your father. They lived right there when\nyou were born. She doesn't dislike you; she merely tries to make herself\nthink she does. There's no sense in the world in you not having his\nviolin. I've a great notion----”\n\n“Has mother got it?”\n\n“No. I've never heard her mention it. It was not at home when he--when\nhe died.”\n\n“Do you know where it is?”\n\n“Yes. I'm the only person on earth who does, except the one who has it.”\n\n“Who is that?”\n\n“I can't tell you, but I will see if they have it yet, and get it if I\ncan. But if your mother finds it out she will never forgive me.”\n\n“I can't help it,” said Elnora. “I want that violin.”\n\n“I'll go to-morrow, and see if it has been destroyed.”\n\n“Destroyed! Oh, Aunt Margaret! Would any one dare?”\n\n“I hardly think so. It was a good instrument. He played it like a\nmaster.”\n\n“Tell me!” breathed Elnora.\n\n“His hair was red and curled more than yours, and his eyes were blue.\nHe was tall, slim, and the very imp of mischief. He joked and teased all\nday until he picked up that violin. Then his head bent over it, and his\neyes got big and earnest. He seemed to listen as if he first heard the\nnotes, and then copied them. Sometimes he drew the bow trembly, like\nhe wasn't sure it was right, and he might have to try again. He could\nalmost drive you crazy when he wanted to, and no man that ever lived\ncould make you dance as he could. He made it all up as he went. He\nseemed to listen for his dancing music, too. It appeared to come to him;\nhe'd begin to play and you had to keep time. You couldn't be still; he\nloved to sweep a crowd around with that bow of his. I think it was the\nthing you call inspiration. I can see him now, his handsome head\nbent, his cheeks red, his eyes snapping, and that bow going across the\nstrings, and driving us like sheep. He always kept his body swinging,\nand he loved to play. He often slighted his work shamefully, and\nsometimes her a little; that is why she hated it--Elnora, what are you\nmaking me do?”\n\nThe tears were rolling down Elnora's cheeks. “Oh, Aunt Margaret,” she\nsobbed. “Why haven't you told me about him sooner? I feel as if you had\ngiven my father to me living, so that I could touch him. I can see him,\ntoo! Why didn't you ever tell me before? Go on! Go on!”\n\n“I can't, Elnora! I'm scared silly. I never meant to say anything. If I\nhadn't promised her not to talk of him to you she wouldn't have let you\ncome here. She made me swear it.”\n\n“But why? Why? Was he a shame? Was he disgraced?”\n\n“Maybe it was that unjust feeling that took possession of her when\nshe couldn't help him from the swamp. She had to blame some one, or go\ncrazy, so she took it out on you. At times, those first ten years, if I\nhad talked to you, and you had repeated anything to her, she might have\nstruck you too hard. She was not master of herself. You must be patient\nwith her, Elnora. God only knows what she has gone through, but I think\nshe is a little better, lately.”\n\n“So do I,” said Elnora. “She seems more interested in my clothes, and\nshe fixes me such delicious lunches that the girls bring fine candies\nand cake and beg to trade. I gave half my lunch for a box of candy one\nday, brought it home to her, and told her. Since, she has wanted me to\ncarry a market basket and treat the crowd every day, she was so pleased.\nLife has been too monotonous for her. I think she enjoys even the little\nchange made by my going and coming. She sits up half the night to read\nthe library books I bring, but she is so stubborn she won't even admit\nthat she touches them. Tell me more about my father.”\n\n“Wait until I see if I can find the violin.”\n\nSo Elnora went home in suspense, and that night she added to her\nprayers: “Dear Lord, be merciful to my father, and oh, do help Aunt\nMargaret to get his violin.”\n\nWesley and Billy came in to supper tired and hungry. Billy ate heartily,\nbut his eyes often rested on a plate of tempting cookies, and when\nWesley offered them to the boy he reached for one. Margaret was\ncompelled to explain that cookies were forbidden that night.\n\n“What!” said Wesley. “Wrong words been coming again. Oh Billy, I do wish\nyou could remember! I can't sit and eat cookies before a little boy\nwho has none. I'll have to put mine back, too.” Billy's face twisted in\ndespair.\n\n“Aw go on!” he said gruffly, but his chin was jumping, for Wesley was\nhis idol.\n\n“Can't do it,” said Wesley. “It would choke me.”\n\nBilly turned to Margaret. “You make him,” he appealed.\n\n“He can't, Billy,” said Margaret. “I know how he feels. You see, I can't\nmyself.”\n\nThen Billy slid from his chair, ran to the couch, buried his face in\nthe pillow and cried heart-brokenly. Wesley hurried to the barn, and\nMargaret to the kitchen. When the dishes were washed Billy slipped from\nthe back door.\n\nWesley piling hay into the mangers heard a sound behind him and\ninquired, “That you, Billy?”\n\n“Yes,” answered Billy, “and it's all so dark you can't see me now, isn't\nit?”\n\n“Well, mighty near,” answered Wesley.\n\n“Then you stoop down and open your mouth.”\n\nSinton had shared bites of apple and nuts for weeks, for Billy had not\nlearned how to eat anything without dividing with Jimmy and Belle. Since\nhe had been separated from them, he shared with Wesley and Margaret.\nSo he bent over the boy and received an instalment of cooky that almost\nchoked him.\n\n“Now you can eat it!” shouted Billy in delight. “It's all dark! I can't\nsee what you're doing at all!”\n\nWesley picked up the small figure and set the boy on the back of a horse\nto bring his face level so that they could talk as men. He never towered\nfrom his height above Billy, but always lifted the little soul when\nimportant matters were to be discussed.\n\n“Now what a dandy scheme,” he commented. “Did you and Aunt Margaret fix\nit up?”\n\n“No. She ain't had hers yet. But I got one for her. Ist as soon as you\neat yours, I am going to take hers, and feed her first time I find her\nin the dark.”\n\n“But Billy, where did you get the cookies? You know Aunt Margaret said\nyou were not to have any.”\n\n“I ist took them,” said Billy, “I didn't take them for me. I ist took\nthem for you and her.”\n\nWesley thought fast. In the warm darkness of the barn the horses\ncrunched their corn, a rat gnawed at a corner of the granary, and among\nthe rafters the white pigeon cooed a soft sleepy note to his dusky mate.\n\n“Did--did--I steal?” wavered Billy.\n\nWesley's big hands closed until he almost hurt the boy.\n\n“No!” he said vehemently. “That is too big a word. You made a mistake.\nYou were trying to be a fine little man, but you went at it the wrong\nway. You only made a mistake. All of us do that, Billy. The world grows\nthat way. When we make mistakes we can see them; that teaches us to be\nmore careful the next time, and so we learn.”\n\n“How wouldn't it be a mistake?”\n\n“If you had told Aunt Margaret what you wanted to do, and asked her for\nthe cookies she would have given them to you.”\n\n“But I was 'fraid she wouldn't, and you ist had to have it.”\n\n“Not if it was wrong for me to have it, Billy. I don't want it that\nmuch.”\n\n“Must I take it back?”\n\n“You think hard, and decide yourself.”\n\n“Lift me down,” said Billy, after a silence, “I got to put this in the\njar, and tell her.”\n\nWesley set the boy on the floor, but as he did so he paused one second\nand strained him close to his breast.\n\nMargaret sat in her chair sewing; Billy slipped in and crept beside her.\nThe little face was lined with tragedy.\n\n“Why Billy, whatever is the matter?” she cried as she dropped her sewing\nand held out her arms. Billy stood back. He gripped his little fists\ntight and squared his shoulders. “I got to be shut up in the closet,” he\nsaid.\n\n“Oh Billy! What an unlucky day! What have you done now?”\n\n“I stold!” gulped Billy. “He said it was ist a mistake, but it was\nworser 'an that. I took something you told me I wasn't to have.”\n\n“Stole!” Margaret was in despair. “What, Billy?”\n\n“Cookies!” answered Billy in equal trouble.\n\n“Billy!” wailed Margaret. “How could you?”\n\n“It was for him and you,” sobbed Billy. “He said he couldn't eat it\n'fore me, but out in the barn it's all dark and I couldn't see. I\nthought maybe he could there. Then we might put out the light and you\ncould have yours. He said I only made it worse, cos I mustn't take\nthings, so I got to go in the closet. Will you hold me tight a little\nbit first? He did.”\n\nMargaret opened her arms and Billy rushed in and clung to her a few\nseconds, with all the force of his being, then he slipped to the floor\nand marched to the closet. Margaret opened the door. Billy gave one\nglance at the light, clinched his fists and, walking inside, climbed on\na box. Margaret closed the door.\n\nThen she sat and listened. Was the air pure enough? Possibly he might\nsmother. She had read something once. Was it very dark? What if there\nshould be a mouse in the closet and it should run across his foot and\nfrighten him into spasms. Somewhere she had heard--Margaret leaned\nforward with tense face and listened. Something dreadful might happen.\nShe could bear it no longer. She arose hurriedly and opened the\ndoor. Billy was drawn up on the box in a little heap, and he lifted a\ndisapproving face to her.\n\n“Shut that door!” he said. “I ain't been in here near long enough yet!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nWHEREIN ELNORA HAS MORE FINANCIAL TROUBLES, AND MRS. COMSTOCK AGAIN\nHEARS THE SONG OF THE LIMBERLOST\n\n\nThe following night Elnora hurried to Sintons'. She threw open the back\ndoor and with anxious eyes searched Margaret's face.\n\n“You got it!” panted Elnora. “You got it! I can see by your face that\nyou did. Oh, give it to me!”\n\n“Yes, I got it, honey, I got it all right, but don't be so fast. It\nhad been kept in such a damp place it needed glueing, it had to have\nstrings, and a key was gone. I knew how much you wanted it, so I sent\nWesley right to town with it. They said they could fix it good as new,\nbut it should be varnished, and that it would take several days for the\nglue to set. You can have it Saturday.”\n\n“You found it where you thought it was? You know it's his?”\n\n“Yes, it was just where I thought, and it's the same violin I've seen\nhim play hundreds of times. It's all right, only laying so long it needs\nfixing.”\n\n“Oh Aunt Margaret! Can I ever wait?”\n\n“It does seem a long time, but how could I help it? You couldn't do\nanything with it as it was. You see, it had been hidden away in a\ngarret, and it needed cleaning and drying to make it fit to play again.\nYou can have it Saturday sure. But Elnora, you've got to promise me that\nyou will leave it here, or in town, and not let your mother get a hint\nof it. I don't know what she'd do.”\n\n“Uncle Wesley can bring it here until Monday. Then I will take it to\nschool so that I can practise at noon. Oh, I don't know how to thank\nyou. And there's more than the violin for which to be thankful. You've\ngiven me my father. Last night I saw him plainly as life.”\n\n“Elnora you were dreaming!”\n\n“I know I was dreaming, but I saw him. I saw him so closely that a tiny\nwhite scar at the corner of his eyebrow showed. I was just reaching out\nto touch him when he disappeared.”\n\n“Who told you there was a scar on his forehead?”\n\n“No one ever did in all my life. I saw it last night as he went down.\nAnd oh, Aunt Margaret! I saw what she did, and I heard his cries! No\nmatter what she does, I don't believe I ever can be angry with her\nagain. Her heart is broken, and she can't help it. Oh, it was terrible,\nbut I am glad I saw it. Now, I will always understand.”\n\n“I don't know what to make of that,” said Margaret. “I don't believe in\nsuch stuff at all, but you couldn't make it up, for you didn't know.”\n\n“I only know that I played the violin last night, as he played it, and\nwhile I played he came through the woods from the direction of Carneys'.\nIt was summer and all the flowers were in bloom. He wore gray trousers\nand a blue shirt, his head was bare, and his face was beautiful. I could\nalmost touch him when he sank.”\n\nMargaret stood perplexed. “I don't know what to think of that!” she\nejaculated. “I was next to the last person who saw him before he was\ndrowned. It was late on a June afternoon, and he was dressed as you\ndescribe. He was bareheaded because he had found a quail's nest before\nthe bird began to brood, and he gathered the eggs in his hat and left it\nin a fence corner to get on his way home; they found it afterward.”\n\n“Was he coming from Carneys'?”\n\n“He was on that side of the quagmire. Why he ever skirted it so close\nas to get caught is a mystery you will have to dream out. I never could\nunderstand it.”\n\n“Was he doing something he didn't want my mother to know?”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because if he had been, he might have cut close the swamp so he\ncouldn't be seen from the garden. You know, the whole path straight to\nthe pool where he sank can be seen from our back door. It's firm on our\nside. The danger is on the north and east. If he didn't want mother to\nknow, he might have tried to pass on either of those sides and gone too\nclose. Was he in a hurry?”\n\n“Yes, he was,” said Margaret. “He had been away longer than he expected,\nand he almost ran when he started home.”\n\n“And he'd left his violin somewhere that you knew, and you went and got\nit. I'll wager he was going to play, and didn't want mother to find it\nout!”\n\n“It wouldn't make any difference to you if you knew every little thing,\nso quit thinking about it, and just be glad you are to have what he\nloved best of anything.”\n\n“That's true. Now I must hurry home. I am dreadfully late.”\n\nElnora sprang up and ran down the road, but when she approached the\ncabin she climbed the fence, crossed the open woods pasture diagonally\nand entered at the back garden gate. As she often came that way when she\nhad been looking for cocoons her mother asked no questions.\n\nElnora lived by the minute until Saturday, when, contrary to his usual\ncustom, Wesley went to town in the forenoon, taking her along to buy\nsome groceries. Wesley drove straight to the music store, and asked for\nthe violin he had left to be mended.\n\nIn its new coat of varnish, with new keys and strings, it seemed much\nlike any other violin to Sinton, but to Elnora it was the most beautiful\ninstrument ever made, and a priceless treasure. She held it in her arms,\ntouched the strings softly and then she drew the bow across them in\nwhispering measure. She had no time to think what a remarkably good\nbow it was for sixteen years' disuse. The tan leather case might have\nimpressed her as being in fine condition also, had she been in a state\nto question anything. She did remember to ask for the bill and she was\ngravely presented with a slip calling for four strings, one key, and a\ncoat of varnish, total, one dollar fifty. It seemed to Elnora she never\ncould put the precious instrument in the case and start home. Wesley\nleft her in the music store where the proprietor showed her all he\ncould about tuning, and gave her several beginners' sheets of notes and\nscales. She carried the violin in her arms as far as the crossroads at\nthe corner of their land, then reluctantly put it under the carriage\nseat.\n\nAs soon as her work was done she ran down to Sintons' and began to play,\nand on Monday the violin went to school with her. She made arrangements\nwith the superintendent to leave it in his office and scarcely took time\nfor her food at noon, she was so eager to practise. Often one of\nthe girls asked her to stay in town all night for some lecture or\nentertainment. She could take the violin with her, practise, and secure\nhelp. Her skill was so great that the leader of the orchestra offered to\ngive her lessons if she would play to pay for them, so her progress was\nrapid in technical work. But from the first day the instrument became\nhers, with perfect faith that she could play as her father did, she\nspent half her practice time in imitating the sounds of all outdoors and\nimprovising the songs her happy heart sang in those days.\n\nSo the first year went, and the second and third were a repetition; but\nthe fourth was different, for that was the close of the course, ending\nwith graduation and all its attendant ceremonies and expenses. To Elnora\nthese appeared mountain high. She had hoarded every cent, thinking twice\nbefore she parted with a penny, but teaching natural history in the\ngrades had taken time from her studies in school which must be made up\noutside. She was a conscientious student, ranking first in most of her\nclasses, and standing high in all branches. Her interest in her violin\nhad grown with the years. She went to school early and practised half\nan hour in the little room adjoining the stage, while the orchestra\ngathered. She put in a full hour at noon, and remained another half hour\nat night. She carried the violin to Sintons' on Saturday and practised\nall the time she could there, while Margaret watched the road to see\nthat Mrs. Comstock was not coming. She had become so skilful that it was\na delight to hear her play music of any composer, but when she played\nher own, that was joy inexpressible, for then the wind blew, the water\nrippled, the Limberlost sang her songs of sunshine, shadow, black storm,\nand white night.\n\nSince her dream Elnora had regarded her mother with peculiar tenderness.\nThe girl realized, in a measure, what had happened. She avoided anything\nthat possibly could stir bitter memories or draw deeper a line on the\nhard, white face. This cost many sacrifices, much work, and sometimes\ndelayed progress, but the horror of that awful dream remained with\nElnora. She worked her way cheerfully, doing all she could to interest\nher mother in things that happened in school, in the city, and by\ncarrying books that were entertaining from the public library.\n\nThree years had changed Elnora from the girl of sixteen to the very\nverge of womanhood. She had grown tall, round, and her face had the\nloveliness of perfect complexion, beautiful eyes and hair and an added\ntouch from within that might have been called comprehension. It was a\ncompound of self-reliance, hard knocks, heart hunger, unceasing work,\nand generosity. There was no form of suffering with which the girl could\nnot sympathize, no work she was afraid to attempt, no subject she had\ninvestigated she did not understand. These things combined to produce a\nbreadth and depth of character altogether unusual. She was so absorbed\nin her classes and her music that she had not been able to gather many\nspecimens. When she realized this and hunted assiduously, she soon found\nthat changing natural conditions had affected such work. Men all around\nwere clearing available land. The trees fell wherever corn would grow.\nThe swamp was broken by several gravel roads, dotted in places around\nthe edge with little frame houses, and the machinery of oil wells; one\nespecially low place around the region of Freckles's room was nearly\nall that remained of the original. Wherever the trees fell the moisture\ndried, the creeks ceased to flow, the river ran low, and at times the\nbed was dry. With unbroken sweep the winds of the west came, gathering\nforce with every mile and howled and raved; threatening to tear the\nshingles from the roof, blowing the surface from the soil in clouds of\nfine dust and rapidly changing everything. From coming in with two or\nthree dozen rare moths in a day, in three years' time Elnora had grown\nto be delighted with finding two or three. Big pursy caterpillars could\nnot be picked from their favourite bushes, when there were no bushes.\nDragonflies would not hover over dry places, and butterflies became\nscarce in proportion to the flowers, while no land yields over three\ncrops of Indian relics.\n\nAll the time the expense of books, clothing and incidentals had\ncontinued. Elnora added to her bank account whenever she could, and drew\nout when she was compelled, but she omitted the important feature of\ncalling for a balance. So, one early spring morning in the last quarter\nof the fourth year, she almost fainted when she learned that her funds\nwere gone. Commencement with its extra expense was coming, she had no\nmoney, and very few cocoons to open in June, which would be too\nlate. She had one collection for the Bird Woman complete to a pair of\nImperialis moths, and that was her only asset. On the day she added\nthese big Yellow Emperors she had been promised a check for three\nhundred dollars, but she would not get it until these specimens were\nsecured. She remembered that she never had found an Emperor before June.\n\nMoreover, that sum was for her first year in college. Then she would be\nof age, and she meant to sell enough of her share of her father's land\nto finish. She knew her mother would oppose her bitterly in that, for\nMrs. Comstock had clung to every acre and tree that belonged to her\nhusband. Her land was almost complete forest where her neighbours owned\ncleared farms, dotted with wells that every hour sucked oil from beneath\nher holdings, but she was too absorbed in the grief she nursed to know\nor care. The Brushwood road and the redredging of the big Limberlost\nditch had been more than she could pay from her income, and she had\ntrembled before the wicket as she asked the banker if she had funds to\npay it, and wondered why he laughed when he assured her she had. For\nMrs. Comstock had spent no time on compounding interest, and never added\nthe sums she had been depositing through nearly twenty years. Now she\nthought her funds were almost gone, and every day she worried over\nexpenses. She could see no reason in going through the forms of\ngraduation when pupils had all in their heads that was required to\ngraduate. Elnora knew she had to have her diploma in order to enter the\ncollege she wanted to attend, but she did not dare utter the word, until\nhigh school was finished, for, instead of softening as she hoped her\nmother had begun to do, she seemed to remain very much the same.\n\nWhen the girl reached the swamp she sat on a log and thought over the\nexpense she was compelled to meet. Every member of her particular set\nwas having a large photograph taken to exchange with the others. Elnora\nloved these girls and boys, and to say she could not have their pictures\nto keep was more than she could endure. Each one would give to all the\nothers a handsome graduation present. She knew they would prepare gifts\nfor her whether she could make a present in return or not. Then it was\nthe custom for each graduating class to give a great entertainment and\nuse the funds to present the school with a statue for the entrance hall.\nElnora had been cast for and was practising a part in that performance.\nShe was expected to furnish her dress and personal necessities. She had\nbeen told that she must have a green gauze dress, and where was it to\ncome from?\n\nEvery girl of the class would have three beautiful new frocks for\nCommencement: one for the baccalaureate sermon, another, which could be\nplain, for graduation exercises, and a handsome one for the banquet and\nball. Elnora faced the past three years and wondered how she could have\nspent so much money and not kept account of it. She did not realize\nwhere it had gone. She did not know what she could do now. She\nthought over the photographs, and at last settled that question to her\nsatisfaction. She studied longer over the gifts, ten handsome ones there\nmust be, and at last decided she could arrange for them. The green dress\ncame first. The lights would be dim in the scene, and the setting deep\nwoods. She could manage that. She simply could not have three dresses.\nShe would have to get a very simple one for the sermon and do the best\nshe could for graduation. Whatever she got for that must be made with a\nguimpe that could be taken out to make it a little more festive for the\nball. But where could she get even two pretty dresses?\n\nThe only hope she could see was to break into the collection of the man\nfrom India, sell some moths, and try to replace them in June. But in her\nsoul she knew that never would do. No June ever brought just the things\nshe hoped it would. If she spent the college money she knew she could\nnot replace it. If she did not, the only way was to secure a room in\nthe grades and teach a year. Her work there had been so appreciated\nthat Elnora felt with the recommendation she knew she could get from the\nsuperintendent and teachers she could secure a position. She was sure\nshe could pass the examinations easily. She had once gone on Saturday,\ntaken them and secured a license for a year before she left the\nBrushwood school.\n\nShe wanted to start to college when the other girls were going. If she\ncould make the first year alone, she could manage the remainder. But\nmake that first year herself, she must. Instead of selling any of her\ncollection, she must hunt as she never before had hunted and find a\nYellow Emperor. She had to have it, that was all. Also, she had to have\nthose dresses. She thought of Wesley and dismissed it. She thought of\nthe Bird Woman, and knew she could not tell her. She thought of every\nway in which she ever had hoped to earn money and realized that with\nthe play, committee meetings, practising, and final examinations she\nscarcely had time to live, much less to do more than the work required\nfor her pictures and gifts. Again Elnora was in trouble, and this time\nit seemed the worst of all.\n\nIt was dark when she arose and went home.\n\n“Mother,” she said, “I have a piece of news that is decidedly not\ncheerful.”\n\n“Then keep it to yourself!” said Mrs. Comstock. “I think I have enough\nto bear without a great girl like you piling trouble on me.”\n\n“My money is all gone!” said Elnora.\n\n“Well, did you think it would last forever? It's been a marvel to me\nthat it's held out as well as it has, the way you've dressed and gone.”\n\n“I don't think I've spent any that I was not compelled to,” said Elnora.\n“I've dressed on just as little as I possibly could to keep going. I\nam heartsick. I thought I had over fifty dollars to put me through\nCommencement, but they tell me it is all gone.”\n\n“Fifty dollars! To put you through Commencement! What on earth are you\nproposing to do?”\n\n“The same as the rest of them, in the very cheapest way possible.”\n\n“And what might that be?”\n\nElnora omitted the photographs, the gifts and the play. She told only of\nthe sermon, graduation exercises, and the ball.\n\n“Well, I wouldn't trouble myself over that,” sniffed Mrs. Comstock. “If\nyou want to go to a sermon, put on the dress you always use for meeting.\nIf you need white for the exercises wear the new dress you got last\nspring. As for the ball, the best thing for you to do is to stay a mile\naway from such folly. In my opinion you'd best bring home your books,\nand quit right now. You can't be fixed like the rest of them, don't be\nso foolish as to run into it. Just stay here and let these last few days\ngo. You can't learn enough more to be of any account.”\n\n“But, mother,” gasped Elnora. “You don't understand!”\n\n“Oh, yes, I do!” said Mrs. Comstock. “I understand perfectly. So long as\nthe money lasted, you held up your head, and went sailing without even\nexplaining how you got it from the stuff you gathered. Goodness knows\nI couldn't see. But now it's gone, you come whining to me. What have I\ngot? Have you forgot that the ditch and the road completely strapped me?\nI haven't any money. There's nothing for you to do but get out of it.”\n\n“I can't!” said Elnora desperately. “I've gone on too long. It would\nmake a break in everything. They wouldn't let me have my diploma!”\n\n“What's the difference? You've got the stuff in your head. I wouldn't\ngive a rap for a scrap of paper. That don't mean anything!”\n\n“But I've worked four years for it, and I can't enter--I ought to have\nit to help me get a school, when I want to teach. If I don't have my\ngrades to show, people will think I quit because I couldn't pass my\nexaminations. I must have my diploma!”\n\n“Then get it!” said Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“The only way is to graduate with the others.”\n\n“Well, graduate if you are bound to!”\n\n“But I can't, unless I have things enough like the class, that I don't\nlook as I did that first day.”\n\n“Well, please remember I didn't get you into this, and I can't get you\nout. You are set on having your own way. Go on, and have it, and see how\nyou like it!”\n\nElnora went upstairs and did not come down again that night, which her\nmother called pouting.\n\n“I've thought all night,” said the girl at breakfast, “and I can't see\nany way but to borrow the money of Uncle Wesley and pay it back from\nsome that the Bird Woman will owe me, when I get one more specimen. But\nthat means that I can't go to--that I will have to teach this winter, if\nI can get a city grade or a country school.”\n\n“Just you dare go dinging after Wesley Sinton for money,” cried Mrs.\nComstock. “You won't do any such a thing!”\n\n“I can't see any other way. I've got to have the money!”\n\n“Quit, I tell you!”\n\n“I can't quit!--I've gone too far!”\n\n“Well then, let me get your clothes, and you can pay me back.”\n\n“But you said you had no money!”\n\n“Maybe I can borrow some at the bank. Then you can return it when the\nBird Woman pays you.”\n\n“All right,” said Elnora. “I don't need expensive things. Just some kind\nof a pretty cheap white dress for the sermon, and a white one a little\nbetter than I had last summer, for Commencement and the ball. I can use\nthe white gloves and shoes I got myself for last year, and you can\nget my dress made at the same place you did that one. They have my\nmeasurements, and do perfect work. Don't get expensive things. It will\nbe warm so I can go bareheaded.”\n\nThen she started to school, but was so tired and discouraged she\nscarcely could walk. Four years' plans going in one day! For she felt\nthat if she did not start to college that fall she never would. Instead\nof feeling relieved at her mother's offer, she was almost too ill to go\non. For the thousandth time she groaned: “Oh, why didn't I keep account\nof my money?”\n\nAfter that the days passed so swiftly she scarcely had time to think,\nbut several trips her mother made to town, and the assurance that\neverything was all right, satisfied Elnora. She worked very hard to pass\ngood final examinations and perfect herself for the play. For two days\nshe had remained in town with the Bird Woman in order to spend more time\npractising and at her work.\n\nOften Margaret had asked about her dresses for graduation, and Elnora\nhad replied that they were with a woman in the city who had made her a\nwhite dress for last year's Commencement when she was a junior usher,\nand they would be all right. So Margaret, Wesley, and Billy concerned\nthemselves over what they would give her for a present. Margaret\nsuggested a beautiful dress. Wesley said that would look to every one as\nif she needed dresses. The thing was to get a handsome gift like all the\nothers would have. Billy wanted to present her a five-dollar gold piece\nto buy music for her violin. He was positive Elnora would like that best\nof anything.\n\nIt was toward the close of the term when they drove to town one evening\nto try to settle this important question. They knew Mrs. Comstock had\nbeen alone several days, so they asked her to accompany them. She\nhad been more lonely than she would admit, filled with unusual unrest\nbesides, and so she was glad to go. But before they had driven a mile\nBilly had told that they were going to buy Elnora a graduation present,\nand Mrs. Comstock devoutly wished that she had remained at home. She was\nprepared when Billy asked: “Aunt Kate, what are you going to give Elnora\nwhen she graduates?”\n\n“Plenty to eat, a good bed to sleep in, and do all the work while she\ntrollops,” answered Mrs. Comstock dryly.\n\nBilly reflected. “I guess all of them have that,” he said. “I mean a\npresent you buy at the store, like Christmas?”\n\n“It is only rich folks who buy presents at stores,” replied\nMrs. Comstock. “I can't afford it.”\n\n“Well, we ain't rich,” he said, “but we are going to buy Elnora\nsomething as fine as the rest of them have if we sell a corner of the\nfarm. Uncle Wesley said so.”\n\n“A fool and his land are soon parted,” said Mrs. Comstock tersely.\nWesley and Billy laughed, but Margaret did not enjoy the remark.\n\nWhile they were searching the stores for something on which all of them\ncould decide, and Margaret was holding Billy to keep him from\nsaying anything before Mrs. Comstock about the music on which he was\ndetermined, Mr. Brownlee met Wesley and stopped to shake hands.\n\n“I see your boy came out finely,” he said.\n\n“I don't allow any boy anywhere to be finer than Billy,” said Wesley.\n\n“I guess you don't allow any girl to surpass Elnora,” said Mr. Brownlee.\n“She comes home with Ellen often, and my wife and I love her. Ellen\nsays she is great in her part to-night. Best thing in the whole play!\nOf course, you are in to see it! If you haven't reserved seats, you'd\nbetter start pretty soon, for the high school auditorium only seats a\nthousand. It's always jammed at these home-talent plays. All of us want\nto see how our children perform.”\n\n“Why yes, of course,” said the bewildered Wesley. Then he hurried to\nMargaret. “Say,” he said, “there is going to be a play at the high\nschool to-night; and Elnora is in it. Why hasn't she told us?”\n\n“I don't know,” said Margaret, “but I'm going.”\n\n“So am I,” said Billy.\n\n“Me too!” said Wesley, “unless you think for some reason she doesn't\nwant us. Looks like she would have told us if she had. I'm going to ask\nher mother.”\n\n“Yes, that's what's she's been staying in town for,” said Mrs. Comstock.\n“It's some sort of a swindle to raise money for her class to buy some\nsilly thing to stick up in the school house hall to remember them by. I\ndon't know whether it's now or next week, but there's something of the\nkind to be done.”\n\n“Well, it's to-night,” said Wesley, “and we are going. It's my treat,\nand we've got to hurry or we won't get in. There are reserved seats, and\nwe have none, so it's the gallery for us, but I don't care so I get to\ntake one good peep at Elnora.”\n\n“S'pose she plays?” whispered Margaret in his ear.\n\n“Aw, tush! She couldn't!” said Wesley.\n\n“Well, she's been doing it three years in the orchestra, and working\nlike a slave at it.”\n\n“Oh, well that's different. She's in the play to-night. Brownlee told me\nso. Come on, quick! We'll drive and hitch closest place we can find to\nthe building.”\n\nMargaret went in the excitement of the moment, but she was troubled.\n\nWhen they reached the building Wesley tied the team to a railing and\nBilly sprang out to help Margaret. Mrs. Comstock sat still.\n\n“Come on, Kate,” said Wesley, reaching his hand.\n\n“I'm not going anywhere,” said Mrs. Comstock, settling comfortably back\nagainst the cushions.\n\nAll of them begged and pleaded, but it was no use. Not an inch would\nMrs. Comstock budge. The night was warm and the carriage comfortable,\nthe horses were securely hitched. She did not care to see what idiotic\nthing a pack of school children were doing, she would wait until the\nSintons returned. Wesley told her it might be two hours, and she said\nshe did not care if it were four, so they left her.\n\n“Did you ever see such----?”\n\n“Cookies!” cried Billy.\n\n“Such blamed stubbornness in all your life?” demanded Wesley. “Won't\ncome to see as fine a girl as Elnora in a stage performance. Why, I\nwouldn't miss it for fifty dollars!\n\n“I think it's a blessing she didn't,” said Margaret placidly. “I begged\nunusually hard so she wouldn't. I'm scared of my life for fear Elnora\nwill play.”\n\nThey found seats near the door where they could see fairly well. Billy\nstood at the back of the hall and had a good view. By and by, a great\nvolume of sound welled from the orchestra, but Elnora was not playing.\n\n“Told you so!” said Sinton. “Got a notion to go out and see if Kate\nwon't come now. She can take my seat, and I'll stand with Billy.”\n\n“You sit still!” said Margaret emphatically. “This is not over yet.”\n\nSo Wesley remained in his seat. The play opened and progressed very much\nas all high school plays have gone for the past fifty years. But Elnora\ndid not appear in any of the scenes.\n\nOut in the warm summer night a sour, grim woman nursed an aching heart\nand tried to justify herself. The effort irritated her intensely. She\nfelt that she could not afford the things that were being done. The old\nfear of losing the land that she and Robert Comstock had purchased and\nstarted clearing was strong upon her. She was thinking of him, how she\nneeded him, when the orchestra music poured from the open windows near\nher. Mrs. Comstock endured it as long as she could, and then slipped\nfrom the carriage and fled down the street.\n\nShe did not know how far she went or how long she stayed, but everything\nwas still, save an occasional raised voice when she wandered back. She\nstood looking at the building. Slowly she entered the wide gates and\nfollowed up the walk. Elnora had been coming here for almost four years.\nWhen Mrs. Comstock reached the door she looked inside. The wide hall was\nlighted with electricity, and the statuary and the decorations of the\nwalls did not seem like pieces of foolishness. The marble appeared pure,\nwhite, and the big pictures most interesting. She walked the length of\nthe hall and slowly read the titles of the statues and the names of the\npupils who had donated them. She speculated on where the piece Elnora's\nclass would buy could be placed to advantage.\n\nThen she wondered if they were having a large enough audience to buy\nmarble. She liked it better than the bronze, but it looked as if it cost\nmore. How white the broad stairway was! Elnora had been climbing those\nstairs for years and never told her they were marble. Of course, she\nthought they were wood. Probably the upper hall was even grander than\nthis. She went over to the fountain, took a drink, climbed to the first\nlanding and looked around her, and then without thought to the second.\nThere she came opposite the wide-open doors and the entrance to the\nauditorium packed with people and a crowd standing outside. When they\nnoticed a tall woman with white face and hair and black dress, one by\none they stepped a little aside, so that Mrs. Comstock could see the\nstage. It was covered with curtains, and no one was doing anything. Just\nas she turned to go a sound so faint that every one leaned forward and\nlistened, drifted down the auditorium. It was difficult to tell just\nwhat it was; after one instant half the audience looked toward the\nwindows, for it seemed only a breath of wind rustling freshly opened\nleaves; merely a hint of stirring air.\n\nThen the curtains were swept aside swiftly. The stage had been\ntransformed into a lovely little corner of creation, where trees and\nflowers grew and moss carpeted the earth. A soft wind blew and it was\nthe gray of dawn. Suddenly a robin began to sing, then a song sparrow\njoined him, and then several orioles began talking at once. The light\ngrew stronger, the dew drops trembled, flower perfume began to creep out\nto the audience; the air moved the branches gently and a rooster crowed.\nThen all the scene was shaken with a babel of bird notes in which you\ncould hear a cardinal whistling, and a blue finch piping. Back somewhere\namong the high branches a dove cooed and then a horse neighed shrilly.\nThat set a blackbird crying, “T'check,” and a whole flock answered it.\nThe crows began to caw and a lamb bleated. Then the grosbeaks, chats,\nand vireos had something to say, and the sun rose higher, the light grew\nstronger and the breeze rustled the treetops loudly; a cow bawled and\nthe whole barnyard answered. The guineas were clucking, the turkey\ngobbler strutting, the hens calling, the chickens cheeping, the light\nstreamed down straight overhead and the bees began to hum. The air\nstirred strongly, and away in an unseen field a reaper clacked and\nrattled through ripening wheat while the driver whistled. An uneasy\nmare whickered to her colt, the colt answered, and the light began to\ndecline. Miles away a rooster crowed for twilight, and dusk was coming\ndown. Then a catbird and a brown thrush sang against a grosbeak and a\nhermit thrush. The air was tremulous with heavenly notes, the lights\nwent out in the hall, dusk swept across the stage, a cricket sang and\na katydid answered, and a wood pewee wrung the heart with its lonesome\ncry. Then a night hawk screamed, a whip-poor-will complained, a belated\nkilldeer swept the sky, and the night wind sang a louder song. A little\nscreech owl tuned up in the distance, a barn owl replied, and a great\nhorned owl drowned both their voices. The moon shone and the scene was\nwarm with mellow light. The bird voices died and soft exquisite melody\nbegan to swell and roll. In the centre of the stage, piece by piece\nthe grasses, mosses and leaves dropped from an embankment, the foliage\nsoftly blew away, while plainer and plainer came the outlines of a\nlovely girl figure draped in soft clinging green. In her shower of\nbright hair a few green leaves and white blossoms clung, and they fell\nover her robe down to her feet. Her white throat and arms were bare, she\nleaned forward a little and swayed with the melody, her eyes fast on\nthe clouds above her, her lips parted, a pink tinge of exercise in\nher cheeks as she drew her bow. She played as only a peculiar chain of\ncircumstances puts it in the power of a very few to play. All nature had\ngrown still, the violin sobbed, sang, danced and quavered on alone, no\nvoice in particular; the soul of the melody of all nature combined in\none great outpouring.\n\nAt the doorway, a white-faced woman endured it as long as she could and\nthen fell senseless. The men nearest carried her down the hall to the\nfountain, revived her, and then placed her in the carriage to which she\ndirected them. The girl played on and never knew. When she finished,\nthe uproar of applause sounded a block down the street, but the\nhalf-senseless woman scarcely realized what it meant. Then the girl came\nto the front of the stage, bowed, and lifting the violin she played her\nconception of an invitation to dance. Every living soul within sound of\nher notes strained their nerves to sit still and let only their hearts\ndance with her. When that began the woman ran toward the country. She\nnever stopped until the carriage overtook her half-way to her cabin. She\nsaid she had grown tired of sitting, and walked on ahead. That night\nshe asked Billy to remain with her and sleep on Elnora's bed. Then she\npitched headlong upon her own, and suffered agony of soul such as she\nnever before had known. The swamp had sent back the soul of her loved\ndead and put it into the body of the daughter she resented, and it was\nalmost more than she could endure and live.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nWHEREIN ELNORA GRADUATES, AND FRECKLES AND THE ANGEL SEND GIFTS\n\n\nThat was Friday night. Elnora came home Saturday morning and began work.\nMrs. Comstock asked no questions, and the girl only told her that\nthe audience had been large enough to more than pay for the piece of\nstatuary the class had selected for the hall. Then she inquired about\nher dresses and was told they would be ready for her. She had been\ninvited to go to the Bird Woman's to prepare for both the sermon and\nCommencement exercises. Since there was so much practising to do, it had\nbeen arranged that she should remain there from the night of the sermon\nuntil after she was graduated. If Mrs. Comstock decided to attend she\nwas to drive in with the Sintons. When Elnora begged her to come she\nsaid she cared nothing about such silliness.\n\nIt was almost time for Wesley to come to take Elnora to the city, when\nfresh from her bath, and dressed to her outer garment, she stood with\nexpectant face before her mother and cried: “Now my dress, mother!”\n\nMrs. Comstock was pale as she replied: “It's on my bed. Help yourself.”\n\nElnora opened the door and stepped into her mother's room with never a\nmisgiving. Since the night Margaret and Wesley had brought her clothing,\nwhen she first started to school, her mother had selected all of her\ndresses, with Mrs. Sinton's help made most of them, and Elnora had paid\nthe bills. The white dress of the previous spring was the first made at\na dressmaker's. She had worn that as junior usher at Commencement; but\nher mother had selected the material, had it made, and it had fitted\nperfectly and had been suitable in every way. So with her heart at rest\non that point, Elnora hurried to the bed to find only her last summer's\nwhite dress, freshly washed and ironed. For an instant she stared at it,\nthen she picked up the garment, looked at the bed beneath it, and her\ngaze slowly swept the room.\n\nIt was unfamiliar. Perhaps this was the third time she had been in it\nsince she was a very small child. Her eyes ranged over the beautiful\nwalnut dresser, the tall bureau, the big chest, inside which she never\nhad seen, and the row of masculine attire hanging above it. Somewhere a\ndainty lawn or mull dress simply must be hanging: but it was not. Elnora\ndropped on the chest because she felt too weak to stand. In less than\ntwo hours she must be in the church, at Onabasha. She could not wear a\nlast year's washed dress. She had nothing else. She leaned against the\nwall and her father's overcoat brushed her face. She caught the folds\nand clung to it with all her might.\n\n“Oh father! Father!” she moaned. “I need you! I don't believe you would\nhave done this!” At last she opened the door.\n\n“I can't find my dress,” she said.\n\n“Well, as it's the only one there I shouldn't think it would be much\ntrouble.”\n\n“You mean for me to wear an old washed dress to-night?”\n\n“It's a good dress. There isn't a hole in it! There's no reason on earth\nwhy you shouldn't wear it.”\n\n“Except that I will not,” said Elnora. “Didn't you provide any dress for\nCommencement, either?”\n\n“If you soil that to-night, I've plenty of time to wash it again.”\n\nWesley's voice called from the gate.\n\n“In a minute,” answered Elnora.\n\nShe ran upstairs and in an incredibly short time came down wearing one\nof her gingham school dresses. Her face cold and hard, she passed her\nmother and went into the night. Half an hour later Margaret and Billy\nstopped for Mrs. Comstock with the carriage. She had determined fully\nthat she would not go before they called. With the sound of their voices\na sort of horror of being left seized her, so she put on her hat, locked\nthe door and went out to them.\n\n“How did Elnora look?” inquired Margaret anxiously.\n\n“Like she always does,” answered Mrs. Comstock curtly.\n\n“I do hope her dresses are as pretty as the others,” said Margaret.\n“None of them will have prettier faces or nicer ways.”\n\nWesley was waiting before the big church to take care of the team. As\nthey stood watching the people enter the building, Mrs. Comstock felt\nherself growing ill. When they went inside among the lights, saw the\nflower-decked stage, and the masses of finely dressed people, she grew\nno better. She could hear Margaret and Billy softly commenting on what\nwas being done.\n\n“That first chair in the very front row is Elnora's,” exulted Billy,\n“cos she's got the highest grades, and so she gets to lead the\nprocession to the platform.”\n\n“The first chair!” “Lead the procession!” Mrs. Comstock was dumbfounded.\nThe notes of the pipe organ began to fill the building in a slow rolling\nmarch. Would Elnora lead the procession in a gingham dress? Or would\nshe be absent and her chair vacant on this great occasion? For now,\nMrs. Comstock could see that it was a great occasion. Every one would\nremember how Elnora had played a few nights before, and they would miss\nher and pity her. Pity? Because she had no one to care for her. Because\nshe was worse off than if she had no mother. For the first time in\nher life, Mrs. Comstock began to study herself as she would appear to\nothers. Every time a junior girl came fluttering down the aisle, leading\nsome one to a seat, and Mrs. Comstock saw a beautiful white dress pass,\na wave of positive illness swept over her. What had she done? What would\nbecome of Elnora?\n\nAs Elnora rode to the city, she answered Wesley's questions in\nmonosyllables so that he thought she was nervous or rehearsing her\nspeech and did not care to talk. Several times the girl tried to\ntell him and realized that if she said the first word it would bring\nuncontrollable tears. The Bird Woman opened the screen and stared\nunbelievingly.\n\n“Why, I thought you would be ready; you are so late!” she said. “If\nyou have waited to dress here, we must hurry.”\n\n“I have nothing to put on,” said Elnora.\n\nIn bewilderment the Bird Woman drew her inside.\n\n“Did--did--” she faltered. “Did you think you would wear that?”\n\n“No. I thought I would telephone Ellen that there had been an accident\nand I could not come. I don't know yet how to explain. I'm too sick to\nthink. Oh, do you suppose I can get something made by Tuesday, so that I\ncan graduate?”\n\n“Yes; and you'll get something on you to-night, so that you can lead\nyour class, as you have done for four years. Go to my room and take off\nthat gingham, quickly. Anna, drop everything, and come help me.”\n\nThe Bird Woman ran to the telephone and called Ellen Brownlee.\n\n“Elnora has had an accident. She will be a little late,” she said.\n“You have got to make them wait. Have them play extra music before the\nmarch.”\n\nThen she turned to the maid. “Tell Benson to have the carriage at the\ngate, just as soon as he can get it there. Then come to my room. Bring\nthe thread box from the sewing-room, that roll of wide white ribbon on\nthe cutting table, and gather all the white pins from every dresser in\nthe house. But first come with me a minute.”\n\n“I want that trunk with the Swamp Angel's stuff in it, from the cedar\ncloset,” she panted as they reached the top of the stairs.\n\nThey hurried down the hall together and dragged the big trunk to the\nBird Woman's room. She opened it and began tossing out white stuff.\n\n“How lucky that she left these things!” she cried. “Here are white\nshoes, gloves, stockings, fans, everything!”\n\n“I am all ready but a dress,” said Elnora.\n\nThe Bird Woman began opening closets and pulling out drawers and boxes.\n\n“I think I can make it this way,” she said.\n\nShe snatched up a creamy lace yoke with long sleeves that recently had\nbeen made for her and held it out. Elnora slipped into it, and the Bird\nWoman began smoothing out wrinkles and sewing in pins. It fitted very\nwell with a little lapping in the back. Next, from among the Angel's\nclothing she caught up a white silk waist with low neck and elbow\nsleeves, and Elnora put it on. It was large enough, but distressingly\nshort in the waist, for the Angel had worn it at a party when she was\nsixteen. The Bird Woman loosened the sleeves and pushed them to a puff\non the shoulders, catching them in places with pins. She began on the\nwide draping of the yoke, fastening it front, back and at each shoulder.\nShe pulled down the waist and pinned it. Next came a soft white dress\nskirt of her own. By pinning her waist band quite four inches above\nElnora's, the Bird Woman could secure a perfect Empire sweep, with the\nclinging silk. Then she began with the wide white ribbon that was to\ntrim a new frock for herself, bound it three times around the high waist\neffect she had managed, tied the ends in a knot and let them fall to the\nfloor in a beautiful sash.\n\n“I want four white roses, each with two or three leaves,” she cried.\n\nAnna ran to bring them, while the Bird Woman added pins.\n\n“Elnora,” she said, “forgive me, but tell me truly. Is your mother so\npoor as to make this necessary?”\n\n“No,” answered Elnora. “Next year I am heir to my share of over three\nhundred acres of land covered with almost as valuable timber as was in\nthe Limberlost. We adjoin it. There could be thirty oil wells drilled\nthat would yield to us the thousands our neighbours are draining from\nunder us, and the bare land is worth over one hundred dollars an acre\nfor farming. She is not poor, she is--I don't know what she is. A great\ntrouble soured and warped her. It made her peculiar. She does not in\nthe least understand, but it is because she doesn't care to, instead of\nignorance. She does not----”\n\nElnora stopped.\n\n“She is--is different,” finished the girl.\n\nAnna came with the roses. The Bird Woman set one on the front of the\ndraped yoke, one on each shoulder and the last among the bright masses\nof brown hair. Then she turned the girl facing the tall mirror.\n\n“Oh!” panted Elnora. “You are a genius! Why, I will look as well as any\nof them.”\n\n“Thank goodness for that!” cried the Bird Woman. “If it wouldn't do, I\nshould have been ill. You are lovely; altogether lovely! Ordinarily I\nshouldn't say that; but when I think of how you are carpentered, I'm\nadmiring the result.”\n\nThe organ began rolling out the march as they came in sight. Elnora\ntook her place at the head of the procession, while every one wondered.\nSecretly they had hoped that she would be dressed well enough, that she\nwould not appear poor and neglected. What this radiant young creature,\ngowned in the most recent style, her smooth skin flushed with\nexcitement, and a rose-set coronet of red gold on her head, had to do\nwith the girl they knew was difficult to decide. The signal was given\nand Elnora began the slow march across the vestry and down the aisle.\nThe music welled softly, and Margaret began to sob without knowing why.\n\nMrs. Comstock gripped her hands together and shut her eyes. It seemed\nan eternity to the suffering woman before Margaret caught her arm and\nwhispered, “Oh, Kate! For any sake look at her! Here! The aisle across!”\n\nMrs. Comstock opened her eyes and directing them where she was told,\ngazed intently, and slid down in her seat close to collapse. She was\nsaved by Margaret's tense clasp and her command: “Here! Idiot! Stop\nthat!”\n\nIn the blaze of light Elnora climbed the steps to the palm-embowered\nplatform, crossed it and took her place. Sixty young men and women,\neach of them dressed the best possible, followed her. There were manly,\nfine-looking men in that class which Elnora led. There were girls of\nbeauty and grace, but not one of them was handsomer or clothed in better\ntaste than she.\n\nBilly thought the time never would come when Elnora would see him, but\nat last she met his eye, then Margaret and Wesley had faint signs of\nrecognition in turn, but there was no softening of the girl's face and\nno hint of a smile when she saw her mother.\n\nHeartsick, Katharine Comstock tried to prove to herself that she was\njustified in what she had done, but she could not. She tried to blame\nElnora for not saying that she was to lead a procession and sit on a\nplatform in the sight of hundreds of people; but that was impossible,\nfor she realized that she would have scoffed and not understood if she\nhad been told. Her heart pained until she suffered with every breath.\n\nWhen at last the exercises were over she climbed into the carriage and\nrode home without a word. She did not hear what Margaret and Billy were\nsaying. She scarcely heard Wesley, who drove behind, when he told her\nthat Elnora would not be home until Wednesday. Early the next morning\nMrs. Comstock was on her way to Onabasha. She was waiting when the\nBrownlee store opened. She examined ready-made white dresses, but they\nhad only one of the right size, and it was marked forty dollars. Mrs.\nComstock did not hesitate over the price, but whether the dress would be\nsuitable. She would have to ask Elnora. She inquired her way to the home\nof the Bird Woman and knocked.\n\n“Is Elnora Comstock here?” she asked the maid.\n\n“Yes, but she is still in bed. I was told to let her sleep as long as\nshe would.”\n\n“Maybe I could sit here and wait,” said Mrs. Comstock. “I want to see\nabout getting her a dress for to-morrow. I am her mother.”\n\n“Then you don't need wait or worry,” said the girl cheerfully. “There\nare two women up in the sewing-room at work on a dress for her right\nnow. It will be done in time, and it will be a beauty.”\n\nMrs. Comstock turned and trudged back to the Limberlost. The bitterness\nin her soul became a physical actuality, which water would not wash\nfrom her lips. She was too late! She was not needed. Another woman was\nmothering her girl. Another woman would prepare a beautiful dress such\nas Elnora had worn the previous night. The girl's love and gratitude\nwould go to her. Mrs. Comstock tried the old process of blaming some one\nelse, but she felt no better. She nursed her grief as closely as ever\nin the long days of the girl's absence. She brooded over Elnora's\npossession of the forbidden violin and her ability to play it until the\nperformance could not have been told from her father's. She tried every\nrefuge her mind could conjure, to quiet her heart and remove the fear\nthat the girl never would come home again, but it persisted. Mrs.\nComstock could neither eat nor sleep. She wandered around the cabin and\ngarden. She kept far from the pool where Robert Comstock had sunk from\nsight for she felt that it would entomb her also if Elnora did not come\nhome Wednesday morning. The mother told herself that she would wait, but\nthe waiting was as bitter as anything she ever had known.\n\nWhen Elnora awoke Monday another dress was in the hands of a seamstress\nand was soon fitted. It had belonged to the Angel, and was a soft\nwhite thing that with a little alteration would serve admirably for\nCommencement and the ball. All that day Elnora worked, helping prepare\nthe auditorium for the exercises, rehearsing the march and the speech\nshe was to make in behalf of the class. The following day was even\nbusier. But her mind was at rest, for the dress was a soft delicate lace\neasy to change, and the marks of alteration impossible to detect.\n\nThe Bird Woman had telephoned to Grand Rapids, explained the situation\nand asked the Angel if she might use it. The reply had been to give the\ngirl the contents of the chest. When the Bird Woman told Elnora, tears\nfilled her eyes.\n\n“I will write at once and thank her,” she said. “With all her beautiful\ngowns she does not need them, and I do. They will serve for me often,\nand be much finer than anything I could afford. It is lovely of her\nto give me the dress and of you to have it altered for me, as I never\ncould.”\n\nThe Bird Woman laughed. “I feel religious to-day,” she said. “You know\nthe first and greatest rock of my salvation is 'Do unto others.' I'm\nonly doing to you what there was no one to do for me when I was a girl\nvery like you. Anna tells me your mother was here early this morning and\nthat she came to see about getting you a dress.”\n\n“She is too late!” said Elnora coldly. “She had over a month to prepare\nmy dresses, and I was to pay for them, so there is no excuse.”\n\n“Nevertheless, she is your mother,” said the Bird Woman, softly. “I\nthink almost any kind of a mother must be better than none at all, and\nyou say she has had great trouble.”\n\n“She loved my father and he died,” said Elnora. “The same thing, in\nquite as tragic a manner, has happened to thousands of other women, and\nthey have gone on with calm faces and found happiness in life by loving\nothers. There was something else I am afraid I never shall forget;\nthis I know I shall not, but talking does not help. I must deliver my\npresents and photographs to the crowd. I have a picture and I made a\npresent for you, too, if you would care for them.”\n\n“I shall love anything you give me,” said the Bird Woman. “I know you\nwell enough to know that whatever you do will be beautiful.”\n\nElnora was pleased over that, and as she tried on her dress for the\nlast fitting she was really happy. She was lovely in the dainty gown:\nit would serve finely for the ball and many other like occasions, and it\nwas her very own.\n\nThe Bird Woman's driver took Elnora in the carriage and she called\non all the girls with whom she was especially intimate, and left her\npicture and the package containing her gift to them. By the time she\nreturned parcels for her were arriving. Friends seemed to spring from\neverywhere. Almost every one she knew had some gift for her, while\nbecause they so loved her the members of her crowd had made\nher beautiful presents. There were books, vases, silver pieces,\nhandkerchiefs, fans, boxes of flowers and candy. One big package settled\nthe trouble at Sinton's, for it contained a dainty dress from Margaret,\na five-dollar gold piece, conspicuously labelled, “I earned this\nmyself,” from Billy, with which to buy music; and a gorgeous cut-glass\nperfume bottle, it would have cost five dollars to fill with even a\nmoderate-priced scent, from Wesley.\n\nIn an expressed crate was a fine curly-maple dressing table, sent by\nFreckles. The drawers were filled with wonderful toilet articles from\nthe Angel. The Bird Woman added an embroidered linen cover and a small\nsilver vase for a few flowers, so no girl of the class had finer gifts.\nElnora laid her head on the table sobbing happily, and the Bird Woman\nwas almost crying herself. Professor Henley sent a butterfly book,\nthe grade rooms in which Elnora had taught gave her a set of volumes\ncovering every phase of life afield, in the woods, and water. Elnora\nhad no time to read so she carried one of these books around with her\nhugging it as she went. After she had gone to dress a queer-looking\npackage was brought by a small boy who hopped on one foot as he handed\nit in and said: “Tell Elnora that is from her ma.”\n\n“Who are you?” asked the Bird Woman as she took the bundle.\n\n“I'm Billy!” announced the boy. “I gave her the five dollars. I earned\nit myself dropping corn, sticking onions, and pulling weeds. My, but you\ngot to drop, and stick, and pull a lot before it's five dollars' worth.”\n\n“Would you like to come in and see Elnora's gifts?”\n\n“Yes, ma'am!” said Billy, trying to stand quietly.\n\n“Gee-mentley!” he gasped. “Does Elnora get all this?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I bet you a thousand dollars I be first in my class when I graduate.\nSay, have the others got a lot more than Elnora?”\n\n“I think not.”\n\n“Well, Uncle Wesley said to find out if I could, and if she didn't\nhave as much as the rest, he'd buy till she did, if it took a hundred\ndollars. Say, you ought to know him! He's just scrumptious! There ain't\nanybody any where finer 'an he is. My, he's grand!”\n\n“I'm very sure of it!” said the Bird Woman. “I've often heard Elnora say\nso.”\n\n“I bet you nobody can beat this!” he boasted. Then he stopped, thinking\ndeeply. “I don't know, though,” he began reflectively. “Some of them are\nawful rich; they got big families to give them things and wagon loads of\nfriends, and I haven't seen what they have. Now, maybe Elnora is getting\nleft, after all!”\n\n“Don't worry, Billy,” she said. “I will watch, and if I find Elnora is\n'getting left' I'll buy her some more things myself. But I'm sure she\nis not. She has more beautiful gifts now than she will know what to\ndo with, and others will come. Tell your Uncle Wesley his girl is\nbountifully remembered, very happy, and she sends her dearest love to\nall of you. Now you must go, so I can help her dress. You will be there\nto-night of course?”\n\n“Yes, sir-ee! She got me a seat, third row from the front, middle\nsection, so I can see, and she's going to wink at me, after she gets her\nspeech off her mind. She kissed me, too! She's a perfect lady, Elnora\nis. I'm going to marry her when I am big enough.”\n\n“Why isn't that splendid!” laughed the Bird Woman as she hurried\nupstairs.\n\n“Dear!” she called. “Here is another gift for you.”\n\nElnora was half disrobed as she took the package and, sitting on a\ncouch, opened it. The Bird Woman bent over her and tested the fabric\nwith her fingers.\n\n“Why, bless my soul!” she cried. “Hand-woven, hand-embroidered linen,\nfine as silk. It's priceless' I haven't seen such things in years. My\nmother had garments like those when I was a child, but my sisters had\nthem cut up for collars, belts, and fancy waists while I was small. Look\nat the exquisite work!”\n\n“Where could it have come from?” cried Elnora.\n\nShe shook out a petticoat, with a hand-wrought ruffle a foot deep, then\nan old-fashioned chemise the neck and sleeve work of which was elaborate\nand perfectly wrought. On the breast was pinned a note that she hastily\nopened.\n\n“I was married in these,” it read, “and I had intended to be buried in\nthem, but perhaps it would be more sensible for you to graduate and get\nmarried in them yourself, if you like. Your mother.”\n\n“From my mother!” Wide-eyed, Elnora looked at the Bird Woman. “I never\nin my life saw the like. Mother does things I think I never can forgive,\nand when I feel hardest, she turns around and does something that makes\nme think she just must love me a little bit, after all. Any of the girls\nwould give almost anything to graduate in hand-embroidered linen like\nthat. Money can't buy such things. And they came when I was thinking she\ndidn't care what became of me. Do you suppose she can be insane?”\n\n“Yes,” said the Bird Woman. “Wildly insane, if she does not love you and\ncare what becomes of you.”\n\nElnora arose and held the petticoat to her. “Will you look at it?” she\ncried. “Only imagine her not getting my dress ready, and then sending me\nsuch a petticoat as this! Ellen would pay fifty dollars for it and\nnever blink. I suppose mother has had it all my life, and I never saw it\nbefore.”\n\n“Go take your bath and put on those things,” said the Bird Woman.\n“Forget everything and be happy. She is not insane. She is embittered.\nShe did not understand how things would be. When she saw, she came at\nonce to provide you a dress. This is her way of saying she is sorry\nshe did not get the other. You notice she has not spent any money, so\nperhaps she is quite honest in saying she has none.”\n\n“Oh, she is honest!” said Elnora. “She wouldn't care enough to tell an\nuntruth. She'd say just how things were, no matter what happened.”\n\nSoon Elnora was ready for her dress. She never had looked so well as\nwhen she again headed the processional across the flower and palm decked\nstage of the high school auditorium. As she sat there she could have\nreached over and dropped a rose she carried into the seat she had\noccupied that September morning when she entered the high school. She\nspoke the few words she had to say in behalf of the class beautifully,\nhad the tiny wink ready for Billy, and the smile and nod of recognition\nfor Wesley and Margaret. When at last she looked into the eyes of a\nwhite-faced woman next them, she slipped a hand to her side and raised\nher skirt the fraction of an inch, just enough to let the embroidered\nedge of a petticoat show a trifle. When she saw the look of relief\nwhich flooded her mother's face, Elnora knew that forgiveness was in her\nheart, and that she would go home in the morning.\n\nIt was late afternoon before she arrived, and a dray followed with a\nload of packages. Mrs. Comstock was overwhelmed. She sat half dazed\nand made Elnora show her each costly and beautiful or simple and useful\ngift, tell her carefully what it was and from where it came. She studied\nthe faces of Elnora's particular friends. The gifts from them had to be\nset in a group. Several times she started to speak and then stopped. At\nlast, between her dry lips, came a harsh whisper.\n\n“Elnora, what did you give back for these things?”\n\n“I'll show you,” said Elnora cheerfully. “I made the same gifts for the\nBird Woman, Aunt Margaret and you if you care for it. But I have to run\nupstairs to get it.”\n\nWhen she returned she handed her mother an oblong frame, hand carved,\nenclosing Elnora's picture, taken by a schoolmate's camera. She wore\nher storm-coat and carried a dripping umbrella. From under it looked\nher bright face; her books and lunchbox were on her arm, and across the\nbottom of the frame was carved, “Your Country Classmate.”\n\nThen she offered another frame.\n\n“I am strong on frames,” she said. “They seemed to be the best I could\ndo without money. I located the maple and the black walnut myself, in a\nlittle corner that had been overlooked between the river and the ditch.\nThey didn't seem to belong to any one so I just took them. Uncle Wesley\nsaid it was all right, and he cut and hauled them for me. I gave the\nmill half of each tree for sawing and curing the remainder. Then I gave\nthe wood-carver half of that for making my frames. A photographer gave\nme a lot of spoiled plates, and I boiled off the emulsion, and took the\nspecimens I framed from my stuff. The man said the white frames were\nworth three and a half, and the black ones five. I exchanged those\nlittle framed pictures for the photographs of the others. For presents,\nI gave each one of my crowd one like this, only a different moth. The\nBird Woman gave me the birch bark. She got it up north last summer.”\n\nElnora handed her mother a handsome black-walnut frame a foot and a\nhalf wide by two long. It finished a small, shallow glass-covered box of\nbirch bark, to the bottom of which clung a big night moth with delicate\npale green wings and long exquisite trailers.\n\n“So you see I did not have to be ashamed of my gifts,” said Elnora. “I\nmade them myself and raised and mounted the moths.”\n\n“Moth, you call it,” said Mrs. Comstock. “I've seen a few of the things\nbefore.”\n\n“They are numerous around us every June night, or at least they used\nto be,” said Elnora. “I've sold hundreds of them, with butterflies,\ndragonflies, and other specimens. Now, I must put away these and get to\nwork, for it is almost June and there are a few more I want dreadfully.\nIf I find them I will be paid some money for which I have been working.”\n\nShe was afraid to say college at that time. She thought it would be\nbetter to wait a few days and see if an opportunity would not come when\nit would work in more naturally. Besides, unless she could secure the\nYellow Emperor she needed to complete her collection, she could not talk\ncollege until she was of age, for she would have no money.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nWHEREIN MARGARET SINTON REVEALS A SECRET, AND MRS. COMSTOCK POSSESSES\nTHE LIMBERLOST\n\n\n“Elnora, bring me the towel, quick!” cried Mrs Comstock.\n\n“In a minute, mother,” mumbled Elnora.\n\nShe was standing before the kitchen mirror, tying the back part of her\nhair, while the front turned over her face.\n\n“Hurry! There's a varmint of some kind!”\n\nElnora ran into the sitting-room and thrust the heavy kitchen towel into\nher mother's hand. Mrs. Comstock swung open the screen door and struck\nat some object, Elnora tossed the hair from her face so that she could\nsee past her mother. The girl screamed wildly.\n\n“Don't! Mother, don't!”\n\nMrs. Comstock struck again. Elnora caught her arm. “It's the one I want!\nIt's worth a lot of money! Don't! Oh, you shall not!”\n\n“Shan't, missy?” blazed Mrs. Comstock. “When did you get to bossing me?”\n\nThe hand that held the screen swept a half-circle and stopped at\nElnora's cheek. She staggered with the blow, and across her face, paled\nwith excitement, a red mark arose rapidly. The screen slammed shut,\nthrowing the creature on the floor before them. Instantly Mrs. Comstock\ncrushed it with her foot. Elnora stepped back. Excepting the red mark,\nher face was very white.\n\n“That was the last moth I needed,” she said, “to complete a collection\nworth three hundred dollars. You've ruined it before my eyes!”\n\n“Moth!” cried Mrs. Comstock. “You say that because you are mad. Moths\nhave big wings. I know a moth!”\n\n“I've kept things from you,” said Elnora, “because I didn't dare confide\nin you. You had no sympathy with me. But you know I never told you\nuntruths in all my life.”\n\n“It's no moth!” reiterated Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“It is!” cried Elnora. “It's from a case in the ground. Its wings take\ntwo or three hours to expand and harden.”\n\n“If I had known it was a moth----” Mrs. Comstock wavered.\n\n“You did know! I told you! I begged you to stop! It meant just three\nhundred dollars to me.”\n\n“Bah! Three hundred fiddlesticks!”\n\n“They are what have paid for books, tuition, and clothes for the past\nfour years. They are what I could have started on to college. You've\nruined the very one I needed. You never made any pretence of loving me.\nAt last I'll be equally frank with you. I hate you! You are a selfish,\nwicked woman! I hate you!”\n\nElnora turned, went through the kitchen and from the back door. She\nfollowed the garden path to the gate and walked toward the swamp a\nshort distance when reaction overtook her. She dropped on the ground and\nleaned against a big log. When a little child, desperate as now, she had\ntried to die by holding her breath. She had thought in that way to make\nher mother sorry, but she had learned that life was a thing thrust upon\nher and she could not leave it at her wish.\n\nShe was so stunned over the loss of that moth, which she had childishly\nnamed the Yellow Emperor, that she scarcely remembered the blow. She\nhad thought no luck in all the world would be so rare as to complete\nher collection; now she had been forced to see a splendid Imperialis\ndestroyed before her. There was a possibility that she could find\nanother, but she was facing the certainty that the one she might have\nhad and with which she undoubtedly could have attracted others, was\nspoiled by her mother. How long she sat there Elnora did not know or\ncare. She simply suffered in dumb, abject misery, an occasional dry sob\nshaking her. Aunt Margaret was right. Elnora felt that morning that\nher mother never would be any different. The girl had reached the place\nwhere she realized that she could endure it no longer.\n\nAs Elnora left the room, Mrs. Comstock took one step after her.\n\n“You little huzzy!” she gasped.\n\nBut Elnora was gone. Her mother stood staring.\n\n“She never did lie to me,” she muttered. “I guess it was a moth. And\nthe only one she needed to get three hundred dollars, she said. I wish I\nhadn't been so fast! I never saw anything like it. I thought it was some\ndeadly, stinging, biting thing. A body does have to be mighty careful\nhere. But likely I've spilt the milk now. Pshaw! She can find another!\nThere's no use to be foolish. Maybe moths are like snakes, where there's\none, there are two.”\n\nMrs. Comstock took the broom and swept the moth out of the door. Then\nshe got down on her knees and carefully examined the steps, logs and\nthe earth of the flower beds at each side. She found the place where\nthe creature had emerged from the ground, and the hard, dark-brown case\nwhich had enclosed it, still wet inside. Then she knew Elnora had been\nright. It was a moth. Its wings had been damp and not expanded. Mrs.\nComstock never before had seen one in that state, and she did not know\nhow they originated. She had thought all of them came from cases spun on\ntrees or against walls or boards. She had seen only enough to know that\nthere were such things; as a flash of white told her that an ermine was\non her premises, or a sharp “buzzzzz” warned her of a rattler.\n\nSo it was from creatures like that Elnora had secured her school money.\nIn one sickening sweep there rushed into the heart of the woman a full\nrealization of the width of the gulf that separated her from her child.\nLately many things had pointed toward it, none more plainly than when\nElnora, like a reincarnation of her father, had stood fearlessly before\na large city audience and played with even greater skill than he, on\nwhat Mrs. Comstock felt very certain was his violin. But that little\ncrawling creature of earth, crushed by her before its splendid yellow\nand lavender wings could spread and carry it into the mystery of night,\nhad performed a miracle.\n\n“We are nearer strangers to each other than we are with any of the\nneighbours,” she muttered.\n\nSo one of the Almighty's most delicate and beautiful creations was\nsacrificed without fulfilling the law, yet none of its species ever\nserved so glorious a cause, for at last Mrs. Comstock's inner vision had\ncleared. She went through the cabin mechanically. Every few minutes\nshe glanced toward the back walk to see if Elnora were coming. She knew\narrangements had been made with Margaret to go to the city some time\nthat day, so she grew more nervous and uneasy every moment. She was\nhaunted by the fear that the blow might discolour Elnora's cheek; that\nshe would tell Margaret. She went down the back walk, looking intently\nin all directions, left the garden and followed the swamp path. Her step\nwas noiseless on the soft, black earth, and soon she came close enough\nto see Elnora. Mrs. Comstock stood looking at the girl in troubled\nuncertainty. Not knowing what to say, at last she turned and went back\nto the cabin.\n\nNoon came and she prepared dinner, calling, as she always did, when\nElnora was in the garden, but she got no response, and the girl did not\ncome. A little after one o'clock Margaret stopped at the gate.\n\n“Elnora has changed her mind. She is not going,” called Mrs. Comstock.\n\nShe felt that she hated Margaret as she hitched her horse and came up\nthe walk instead of driving on.\n\n“You must be mistaken,” said Margaret. “I was going on purpose for her.\nShe asked me to take her. I had no errand. Where is she?”\n\n“I will call her,” said Mrs. Comstock.\n\nShe followed the path again, and this time found Elnora sitting on the\nlog. Her face was swollen and discoloured, and her eyes red with crying.\nShe paid no attention to her mother.\n\n“Mag Sinton is here,” said Mrs. Comstock harshly. “I told her you had\nchanged your mind, but she said you asked her to go with you, and she\nhad nothing to go for herself.”\n\nElnora arose, recklessly waded through the deep swamp grasses and so\nreached the path ahead of her mother. Mrs. Comstock followed as far as\nthe garden, but she could not enter the cabin. She busied herself among\nthe vegetables, barely looking up when the back-door screen slammed\nnoisily. Margaret Sinton approached colourless, her eyes so angry that\nMrs. Comstock shrank back.\n\n“What's the matter with Elnora's face?” demanded Margaret.\n\nMrs. Comstock made no reply.\n\n“You struck her, did you?”\n\n“I thought you wasn't blind!”\n\n“I have been, for twenty long years now, Kate Comstock,” said Margaret\nSinton, “but my eyes are open at last. What I see is that I've done you\nno good and Elnora a big wrong. I had an idea that it would kill you to\nknow, but I guess you are tough enough to stand anything. Kill or cure,\nyou get it now!”\n\n“What are you frothing about?” coolly asked Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“You!” cried Margaret. “You! The woman who doesn't pretend to love her\nonly child. Who lets her grow to a woman, as you have let Elnora, and\ncan't be satisfied with every sort of neglect, but must add abuse yet;\nand all for a fool idea about a man who wasn't worth his salt!”\n\nMrs. Comstock picked up a hoe.\n\n“Go right on!” she said. “Empty yourself. It's the last thing you'll\never do!”\n\n“Then I'll make a tidy job of it,” said Margaret. “You'll not touch me.\nYou'll stand there and hear the truth at last, and because I dare face\nyou and tell it, you will know in your soul it is truth. When Robert\nComstock shaved that quagmire out there so close he went in, he wanted\nto keep you from knowing where he was coming from. He'd been to see\nElvira Carney. They had plans to go to a dance that night----”\n\n“Close your lips!” said Mrs. Comstock in a voice of deadly quiet.\n\n“You know I wouldn't dare open them if I wasn't telling you the truth.\nI can prove what I say. I was coming from Reeds. It was hot in the woods\nand I stopped at Carney's as I passed for a drink. Elvira's bedridden\nold mother heard me, and she was so crazy for some one to talk with, I\nstepped in a minute. I saw Robert come down the path. Elvira saw him,\ntoo, so she ran out of the house to head him off. It looked funny, and\nI just deliberately moved where I could see and hear. He brought her his\nviolin, and told her to get ready and meet him in the woods with it that\nnight, and they would go to a dance. She took it and hid it in the loft\nto the well-house and promised she'd go.”\n\n“Are you done?” demanded Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“No. I am going to tell you the whole story. You don't spare Elnora\nanything. I shan't spare you. I hadn't been here that day, but I can\ntell you just how he was dressed, which way he went and every word they\nsaid, though they thought I was busy with her mother and wouldn't notice\nthem. Put down your hoe, Kate. I went to Elvira, told her what I knew\nand made her give me Comstock's violin for Elnora over three years ago.\nShe's been playing it ever since. I won't see her slighted and abused\nanother day on account of a man who would have broken your heart if he\nhad lived. Six months more would have showed you what everybody else\nknew. He was one of those men who couldn't trust himself, and so no\nwoman was safe with him. Now, will you drop grieving over him, and do\nElnora justice?”\n\nMrs. Comstock grasped the hoe tighter and turning she went down the\nwalk, and started across the woods to the home of Elvira Carney. With\naverted head she passed the pool, steadily pursuing her way. Elvira\nCarney, hanging towels across the back fence, saw her coming and went\ntoward the gate to meet her. Twenty years she had dreaded that visit.\nSince Margaret Sinton had compelled her to produce the violin she had\nhidden so long, because she was afraid to destroy it, she had come\ncloser expectation than dread. The wages of sin are the hardest debts\non earth to pay, and they are always collected at inconvenient times and\nunexpected places. Mrs. Comstock's face and hair were so white, that her\ndark eyes seemed burned into their setting. Silently she stared at the\nwoman before her a long time.\n\n“I might have saved myself the trouble of coming,” she said at last, “I\nsee you are guilty as sin!”\n\n“What has Mag Sinton been telling you?” panted the miserable woman,\ngripping the fence.\n\n“The truth!” answered Mrs. Comstock succinctly. “Guilt is in every line\nof your face, in your eyes, all over your wretched body. If I'd taken a\ngood look at you any time in all these past years, no doubt I could have\nseen it just as plain as I can now. No woman or man can do what you've\ndone, and not get a mark set on them for every one to read.”\n\n“Mercy!” gasped weak little Elvira Carney. “Have mercy!”\n\n“Mercy?” scoffed Mrs. Comstock. “Mercy! That's a nice word from you! How\nmuch mercy did you have on me? Where's the mercy that sent Comstock to\nthe slime of the bottomless quagmire, and left me to see it, and then\nstruggle on in agony all these years? How about the mercy of letting me\nneglect my baby all the days of her life? Mercy! Do you really dare use\nthe word to me?”\n\n“If you knew what I've suffered!”\n\n“Suffered?” jeered Mrs. Comstock. “That's interesting. And pray, what\nhave you suffered?”\n\n“All the neighbours have suspected and been down on me. I ain't had a\nfriend. I've always felt guilty of his death! I've seen him go down a\nthousand times, plain as ever you did. Many's the night I've stood on\nthe other bank of that pool and listened to you, and I tried to throw\nmyself in to keep from hearing you, but I didn't dare. I knew God would\nsend me to burn forever, but I'd better done it; for now, He has set the\nburning on my body, and every hour it is slowly eating the life out of\nme. The doctor says it's a cancer----”\n\nMrs. Comstock exhaled a long breath. Her grip on the hoe relaxed and her\nstature lifted to towering height.\n\n“I didn't know, or care, when I came here, just what I did,” she said.\n“But my way is beginning to clear. If the guilt of your soul has come\nto a head, in a cancer on your body, it looks as if the Almighty didn't\nneed any of my help in meting out His punishments. I really couldn't fix\nup anything to come anywhere near that. If you are going to burn until\nyour life goes out with that sort of fire, you don't owe me anything!”\n\n“Oh, Katharine Comstock!” groaned Elvira Carney, clinging to the fence\nfor support.\n\n“Looks as if the Bible is right when it says, 'The wages of sin is\ndeath,' doesn't it?” asked Mrs. Comstock. “Instead of doing a woman's\nwork in life, you chose the smile of invitation, and the dress of\nunearned cloth. Now you tell me you are marked to burn to death with the\nunquenchable fire. And him! It was shorter with him, but let me tell you\nhe got his share! He left me with an untruth on his lips, for he told\nme he was going to take his violin to Onabasha for a new key, when he\ncarried it to you. Every vow of love and constancy he ever made me was a\nlie, after he touched your lips, so when he tried the wrong side of\nthe quagmire, to hide from me the direction in which he was coming, it\nreached out for him, and it got him. It didn't hurry, either! It sucked\nhim down, slow and deliberate.”\n\n“Mercy!” groaned Elvira Carney. “Mercy!”\n\n“I don't know the word,” said Mrs. Comstock. “You took all that out of\nme long ago. The past twenty years haven't been of the sort that taught\nmercy. I've never had any on myself and none on my child. Why in the\nname of justice, should I have mercy on you, or on him? You were both\nolder than I, both strong, sane people, you deliberately chose your\ncourse when you lured him, and he, when he was unfaithful to me. When a\nLoose Man and a Light Woman face the end the Almighty ordained for them,\nwhy should they shout at me for mercy? What did I have to do with it?”\n\nElvira Carney sobbed in panting gasps.\n\n“You've got tears, have you?” marvelled Mrs. Comstock. “Mine all dried\nlong ago. I've none left to shed over my wasted life, my disfigured face\nand hair, my years of struggle with a man's work, my wreck of land among\nthe tilled fields of my neighbours, or the final knowledge that the man\nI so gladly would have died to save, wasn't worth the sacrifice of a\nrattlesnake. If anything yet could wring a tear from me, it would be the\nthought of the awful injustice I always have done my girl. If I'd lay\nhand on you for anything, it would be for that.”\n\n“Kill me if you want to,” sobbed Elvira Carney. “I know that I deserve\nit, and I don't care.”\n\n“You are getting your killing fast enough to suit me,” said Mrs.\nComstock. “I wouldn't touch you, any more than I would him, if I could.\nOnce is all any man or woman deceives me about the holiest things of\nlife. I wouldn't touch you any more than I would the black plague. I am\ngoing back to my girl.”\n\nMrs. Comstock turned and started swiftly through the woods, but she had\ngone only a few rods when she stopped, and leaning on the hoe, she stood\nthinking deeply. Then she turned back. Elvira still clung to the fence,\nsobbing bitterly.\n\n“I don't know,” said Mrs. Comstock, “but I left a wrong impression with\nyou. I don't want you to think that I believe the Almighty set a cancer\nto burning you as a punishment for your sins. I don't! I think a lot\nmore of the Almighty. With a whole sky-full of worlds on His hands to\nmanage, I'm not believing that He has time to look down on ours, and\npick you out of all the millions of us sinners, and set a special kind\nof torture to eating you. It wouldn't be a gentlemanly thing to do, and\nfirst of all, the Almighty is bound to be a gentleman. I think likely\na bruise and bad blood is what caused your trouble. Anyway, I've got\nto tell you that the cleanest housekeeper I ever knew, and one of the\nnoblest Christian women, was slowly eaten up by a cancer. She got hers\nfrom the careless work of a poor doctor. The Almighty is to forgive sin\nand heal disease, not to invent and spread it.”\n\nShe had gone only a few steps when she again turned back.\n\n“If you will gather a lot of red clover bloom, make a tea strong as lye\nof it, and drink quarts, I think likely it will help you, if you are\nnot too far gone. Anyway, it will cool your blood and make the burning\neasier to bear.”\n\nThen she swiftly went home. Enter the lonely cabin she could not,\nneither could she sit outside and think. She attacked a bed of beets and\nhoed until the perspiration ran from her face and body, then she began\non the potatoes. When she was too tired to take another stroke she\nbathed and put on dry clothing. In securing her dress she noticed her\nhusband's carefully preserved clothing lining one wall. She gathered it\nin an armload and carried it to the swamp. Piece by piece she pitched\ninto the green maw of the quagmire all those articles she had dusted\ncarefully and fought moths from for years, and stood watching as it\nslowly sucked them down. She went back to her room and gathered every\nscrap that had in any way belonged to Robert Comstock, excepting his gun\nand revolver, and threw it into the swamp. Then for the first time she\nset her door wide open.\n\nShe was too weary now to do more, but an urging unrest drove her. She\nwanted Elnora. It seemed to her she never could wait until the girl came\nand delivered her judgment. At last in an effort to get nearer to her,\nMrs. Comstock climbed the stairs and stood looking around Elnora's room.\nIt was very unfamiliar. The pictures were strange to her. Commencement\nhad filled it with packages and bundles. The walls were covered with\ncocoons; moths and dragonflies were pinned everywhere. Under the bed she\ncould see half a dozen large white boxes. She pulled out one and lifted\nthe lid. The bottom was covered with a sheet of thin cork, and on\nlong pins sticking in it were large, velvet-winged moths. Each one was\nlabelled, always there were two of a kind, in many cases four, showing\nunder and upper wings of both male and female. They were of every colour\nand shape.\n\nMrs. Comstock caught her breath sharply. When and where had Elnora found\nthem? They were the most exquisite sight the woman ever had seen, so she\nopened all the boxes to feast on their beautiful contents. As she did so\nthere came more fully a sense of the distance between her and her child.\nShe could not understand how Elnora had gone to school, and performed\nso much work secretly. When it was finished, to the last moth, she, the\nmother who should have been the first confidant and helper, had been the\none to bring disappointment. Small wonder Elnora had come to hate her.\n\nMrs. Comstock carefully closed and replaced the boxes; and again stood\nlooking around the room. This time her eyes rested on some books she did\nnot remember having seen before, so she picked up one and found that it\nwas a moth book. She glanced over the first pages and was soon eagerly\nreading. When the text reached the classification of species, she laid\nit down, took up another and read the introductory chapters. By that\ntime her brain was in a confused jumble of ideas about capturing moths\nwith differing baits and bright lights.\n\nShe went down stairs thinking deeply. Being unable to sit still and\nhaving nothing else to do she glanced at the clock and began preparing\nsupper. The work dragged. A chicken was snatched up and dressed\nhurriedly. A spice cake sprang into being. Strawberries that had been\nintended for preserves went into shortcake. Delicious odours crept from\nthe cabin. She put many extra touches on the table and then commenced\nwatching the road. Everything was ready, but Elnora did not come. Then\nbegan the anxious process of trying to keep cooked food warm and not\nspoil it. The birds went to bed and dusk came. Mrs. Comstock gave up the\nfire and set the supper on the table. Then she went out and sat on the\nfront-door step watching night creep around her. She started eagerly as\nthe gate creaked, but it was only Wesley Sinton coming.\n\n“Katharine, Margaret and Elnora passed where I was working this\nafternoon, and Margaret got out of the carriage and called me to the\nfence. She told me what she had done. I've come to say to you that I am\nsorry. She has heard me threaten to do it a good many times, but I never\nwould have got it done. I'd give a good deal if I could undo it, but I\ncan't, so I've come to tell you how sorry I am.”\n\n“You've got something to be sorry for,” said Mrs. Comstock, “but likely\nwe ain't thinking of the same thing. It hurts me less to know the truth,\nthan to live in ignorance. If Mag had the sense of a pewee, she'd told\nme long ago. That's what hurts me, to think that both of you knew Robert\nwas not worth an hour of honest grief, yet you'd let me mourn him all\nthese years and neglect Elnora while I did it. If I have anything to\nforgive you, that is what it is.”\n\nWesley removed his hat and sat on a bench.\n\n“Katharine,” he said solemnly, “nobody ever knows how to take you.”\n\n“Would it be asking too much to take me for having a few grains of plain\ncommon sense?” she inquired. “You've known all this time that Comstock\ngot what he deserved, when he undertook to sneak in an unused way across\na swamp, with which he was none too familiar. Now I should have thought\nthat you'd figure that knowing the same thing would be the best method\nto cure me of pining for him, and slighting my child.”\n\n“Heaven only knows we have thought of that, and talked of it often, but\nwe were both too big cowards. We didn't dare tell you.”\n\n“So you have gone on year after year, watching me show indifference to\nElnora, and yet a little horse-sense would have pointed out to you that\nshe was my salvation. Why look at it! Not married quite a year. All his\nvows of love and fidelity made to me before the Almighty forgotten in a\nfew months, and a dance and a Light Woman so alluring he had to lie and\nsneak for them. What kind of a prospect is that for a life? I know men\nand women. An honourable man is an honourable man, and a liar is a liar;\nboth are born and not made. One cannot change to the other any more than\nthat same old leopard can change its spots. After a man tells a woman\nthe first untruth of that sort, the others come piling thick, fast,\nand mountain high. The desolation they bring in their wake overshadows\nanything I have suffered completely. If he had lived six months more I\nshould have known him for what he was born to be. It was in the blood\nof him. His father and grandfather before him were fiddling, dancing\npeople; but I was certain of him. I thought we could leave Ohio and come\nout here alone, and I could so love him and interest him in his work,\nthat he would be a man. Of all the fool, fruitless jobs, making anything\nof a creature that begins by deceiving her, is the foolest a sane woman\never undertook. I am more than sorry you and Margaret didn't see your\nway clear to tell me long ago. I'd have found it out in a few more\nmonths if he had lived, and I wouldn't have borne it a day. The man who\nbreaks his vows to me once, doesn't get the second chance. I give truth\nand honour. I have a right to ask it in return. I am glad I understand\nat last. Now, if Elnora will forgive me, we will take a new start and\nsee what we can make out of what is left of life. If she won't, then it\nwill be my time to learn what suffering really means.”\n\n“But she will,” said Wesley. “She must! She can't help it when things\nare explained.”\n\n“I notice she isn't hurrying any about coming home. Do you know where\nshe is or what she is doing?”\n\n“I do not. But likely she will be along soon. I must go help Billy with\nthe night work. Good-bye, Katharine. Thank the Lord you have come to\nyourself at last!”\n\nThey shook hands and Wesley went down the road while Mrs. Comstock\nentered the cabin. She could not swallow food. She stood in the back\ndoor watching the sky for moths, but they did not seem to be very\nnumerous. Her spirits sank and she breathed unevenly. Then she heard the\nfront screen. She reached the middle door as Elnora touched the foot of\nthe stairs.\n\n“Hurry, and get ready, Elnora,” she said. “Your supper is almost spoiled\nnow.”\n\nElnora closed the stair door behind her, and for the first time in her\nlife, threw the heavy lever which barred out anyone from down stairs.\nMrs. Comstock heard the thud, and knew what it meant. She reeled\nslightly and caught the doorpost for support. For a few minutes she\nclung there, then sank to the nearest chair. After a long time she arose\nand stumbling half blindly, she put the food in the cupboard and covered\nthe table. She took the lamp in one hand, the butter in the other, and\nstarted to the spring house. Something brushed close by her face, and\nshe looked just in time to see a winged creature rise above the cabin\nand sail away.\n\n“That was a night bird,” she muttered. As she stopped to set the butter\nin the water, came another thought. “Perhaps it was a moth!” Mrs.\nComstock dropped the butter and hurried out with the lamp; she held it\nhigh above her head and waited until her arms ached. Small insects of\nnight gathered, and at last a little dusty miller, but nothing came of\nany size.\n\n“I must go where they are, if I get them,” muttered Mrs. Comstock.\n\nShe went to the barn after the stout pair of high boots she used in\nfeeding stock in deep snow. Throwing these beside the back door she\nclimbed to the loft over the spring house, and hunted an old lard oil\nlantern and one of first manufacture for oil. Both these she cleaned and\nfilled. She listened until everything up stairs had been still for over\nhalf an hour. By that time it was past eleven o'clock. Then she took the\nlantern from the kitchen, the two old ones, a handful of matches, a ball\nof twine, and went from the cabin, softly closing the door.\n\nSitting on the back steps, she put on the boots, and then stood gazing\ninto the perfumed June night, first in the direction of the woods on her\nland, then toward the Limberlost. Its outline was so dark and forbidding\nshe shuddered and went down the garden, following the path toward the\nwoods, but as she neared the pool her knees wavered and her courage\nfled. The knowledge that in her soul she was now glad Robert Comstock\nwas at the bottom of it made a coward of her, who fearlessly had mourned\nhim there, nights untold. She could not go on. She skirted the back of\nthe garden, crossed a field, and came out on the road. Soon she reached\nthe Limberlost. She hunted until she found the old trail, then followed\nit stumbling over logs and through clinging vines and grasses. The heavy\nboots clumped on her feet, overhanging branches whipped her face and\npulled her hair. But her eyes were on the sky as she went straining into\nthe night, hoping to find signs of a living creature on wing.\n\nBy and by she began to see the wavering flight of something she thought\nnear the right size. She had no idea where she was, but she stopped,\nlighted a lantern and hung it as high as she could reach. A little\ndistance away she placed the second and then the third. The objects\ncame nearer and sick with disappointment she saw that they were bats.\nCrouching in the damp swamp grasses, without a thought of snakes or\nvenomous insects, she waited, her eyes roving from lantern to lantern.\nOnce she thought a creature of high flight dropped near the lard oil\nlight, so she arose breathlessly waiting, but either it passed or it was\nan illusion. She glanced at the old lantern, then at the new, and was on\nher feet in an instant creeping close. Something large as a small bird\nwas fluttering around. Mrs. Comstock began to perspire, while her hand\nshook wildly. Closer she crept and just as she reached for it, something\nsimilar swept past and both flew away together.\n\nMrs. Comstock set her teeth and stood shivering. For a long time the\nlocusts rasped, the whip-poor-wills cried and a steady hum of night life\nthrobbed in her ears. Away in the sky she saw something coming when it\nwas no larger than a falling leaf. Straight toward the light it flew.\nMrs. Comstock began to pray aloud.\n\n“This way, O Lord! Make it come this way! Please! O Lord, send it\nlower!”\n\nThe moth hesitated at the first light, then slowly, easily it came\ntoward the second, as if following a path of air. It touched a leaf near\nthe lantern and settled. As Mrs. Comstock reached for it a thin yellow\nspray wet her hand and the surrounding leaves. When its wings raised\nabove its back, her fingers came together. She held the moth to the\nlight. It was nearer brown than yellow, and she remembered having seen\nsome like it in the boxes that afternoon. It was not the one needed to\ncomplete the collection, but Elnora might want it, so Mrs. Comstock held\non. Then the Almighty was kind, or nature was sufficient, as you look\nat it, for following the law of its being when disturbed, the moth\nagain threw the spray by which some suppose it attracts its kind, and\nliberally sprinkled Mrs. Comstock's dress front and arms. From that\ninstant, she became the best moth bait ever invented. Every Polyphemus\nin range hastened to her, and other fluttering creatures of night\nfollowed. The influx came her way. She snatched wildly here and there\nuntil she had one in each hand and no place to put them. She could\nsee more coming, and her aching heart, swollen with the strain of long\nexcitement, hurt pitifully. She prayed in broken exclamations that did\nnot always sound reverent, but never was human soul in more intense\nearnest.\n\nMoths were coming. She had one in each hand. They were not yellow, and\nshe did not know what to do. She glanced around to try to discover some\nway to keep what she had, and her throbbing heart stopped and every\nmuscle stiffened. There was the dim outline of a crouching figure not\ntwo yards away, and a pair of eyes their owner thought hidden, caught\nthe light in a cold stream. Her first impulse was to scream and fly for\nlife. Before her lips could open a big moth alighted on her breast while\nshe felt another walking over her hair. All sense of caution deserted\nher. She did not care to live if she could not replace the yellow moth\nshe had killed. She turned her eyes to those among the leaves.\n\n“Here, you!” she cried hoarsely. “I need you! Get yourself out here, and\nhelp me. These critters are going to get away from me. Hustle!”\n\nPete Corson parted the bushes and stepped into the light.\n\n“Oh, it's you!” said Mrs. Comstock. “I might have known! But you gave\nme a start. Here, hold these until I make some sort of bag for them. Go\neasy! If you break them I don't guarantee what will happen to you!”\n\n“Pretty fierce, ain't you!” laughed Pete, but he advanced and held out\nhis hands. “For Elnora, I s'pose?”\n\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Comstock. “In a mad fit, I trampled one this morning,\nand by the luck of the old boy himself it was the last moth she needed\nto complete a collection. I got to get another one or die.”\n\n“Then I guess it's your funeral,” said Pete. “There ain't a chance in a\ndozen the right one will come. What colour was it?”\n\n“Yellow, and big as a bird.”\n\n“The Emperor, likely,” said Pete. “You dig for that kind, and they are\nnot numerous, so's 'at you can smash 'em for fun.”\n\n“Well, I can try to get one, anyway,” said Mrs. Comstock. “I forgot all\nabout bringing anything to put them in. You take a pinch on their wings\nuntil I make a poke.”\n\nMrs. Comstock removed her apron, tearing off the strings. She unfastened\nand stepped from the skirt of her calico dress. With one apron string\nshe tied shut the band and placket. She pulled a wire pin from her\nhair, stuck it through the other string, and using it as a bodkin ran\nit around the hem of her skirt, so shortly she had a large bag. She put\nseveral branches inside to which the moths could cling, closed the mouth\npartially and held it toward Pete.\n\n“Put your hand well down and let the things go!” she ordered. “But be\ncareful, man! Don't run into the twigs! Easy! That's one. Now the other.\nIs the one on my head gone? There was one on my dress, but I guess it\nflew. Here comes a kind of a gray-looking one.”\n\nPete slipped several more moths into the bag.\n\n“Now, that's five, Mrs. Comstock,” he said. “I'm sorry, but you'll have\nto make that do. You must get out of here lively. Your lights will be\ntaken for hurry calls, and inside the next hour a couple of men will\nride here like fury. They won't be nice Sunday-school men, and they\nwon't hold bags and catch moths for you. You must go quick!”\n\nMrs. Comstock laid down the bag and pulled one of the lanterns lower.\n\n“I won't budge a step,” she said. “This land doesn't belong to you.\nYou have no right to order me off it. Here I stay until I get a Yellow\nEmperor, and no little petering thieves of this neighbourhood can scare\nme away.”\n\n“You don't understand,” said Pete. “I'm willing to help Elnora, and I'd\ntake care of you, if I could, but there will be too many for me, and\nthey will be mad at being called out for nothing.”\n\n“Well, who's calling them out?” demanded Mrs. Comstock. “I'm catching\nmoths. If a lot of good-for-nothings get fooled into losing some sleep,\nwhy let them, they can't hurt me, or stop my work.”\n\n“They can, and they'll do both.”\n\n“Well, I'll see them do it!” said Mrs. Comstock. “I've got Robert's\nrevolver in my dress, and I can shoot as straight as any man, if I'm\nmad enough. Any one who interferes with me to-night will find me mad\na-plenty. There goes another!”\n\nShe stepped into the light and waited until a big brown moth settled\non her and was easily taken. Then in light, airy flight came a delicate\npale green thing, and Mrs. Comstock started in pursuit. But the scent\nwas not right. The moth fluttered high, then dropped lower, still lower,\nand sailed away. With outstretched hands Mrs. Comstock pursued it. She\nhurried one way and another, then ran over an object which tripped her\nand she fell. She regained her feet in an instant, but she had lost\nsight of the moth. With livid face she turned to the crouching man.\n\n“You nasty, sneaking son of Satan!” she cried. “Why are you hiding\nthere? You made me lose the one I wanted most of any I've had a chance\nat yet. Get out of here! Go this minute, or I'll fill your worthless\ncarcass so full of holes you'll do to sift cornmeal. Go, I say! I'm\nusing the Limberlost to-night, and I won't be stopped by the devil\nhimself! Cut like fury, and tell the rest of them they can just go home.\nPete is going to help me, and he is all of you I need. Now go!”\n\nThe man turned and went. Pete leaned against a tree, held his mouth shut\nand shook inwardly. Mrs. Comstock came back panting.\n\n“The old scoundrel made me lose that!” she said. “If any one else comes\nsnooping around here I'll just blow them up to start with. I haven't\ntime to talk. Suppose that had been yellow! I'd have killed that man,\nsure! The Limberlost isn't safe to-night, and the sooner those whelps\nfind it out, the better it will be for them.”\n\nPete stopped laughing to look at her. He saw that she was speaking the\ntruth. She was quite past reason, sense, or fear. The soft night air\nstirred the wet hair around her temples, the flickering lanterns made\nher face a ghastly green. She would stop at nothing, that was evident.\nPete suddenly began catching moths with exemplary industry. In putting\none into the bag, another escaped.\n\n“We must not try that again,” said Mrs. Comstock. “Now, what will we\ndo?”\n\n“We are close to the old case,” said Pete. “I think I can get into it.\nMaybe we could slip the rest in there.”\n\n“That's a fine idea!” said Mrs. Comstock. “They'll have so much room\nthere they won't be likely to hurt themselves, and the books say they\ndon't fly in daytime unless they are disturbed, so they will settle when\nit's light, and I can come with Elnora to get them.”\n\nThey captured two more, and then Pete carried them to the case.\n\n“Here comes a big one!” he cried as he returned.\n\nMrs. Comstock looked up and stepped out with a prayer on her lips.\nShe could not tell the colour at that distance, but the moth appeared\ndifferent from the others. On it came, dropping lower and darting from\nlight to light. As it swept near her, “O Heavenly Father!” exulted Mrs.\nComstock, “it's yellow! Careful Pete! Your hat, maybe!”\n\nPete made a long sweep. The moth wavered above the hat and sailed\naway. Mrs. Comstock leaned against a tree and covered her face with her\nshaking hands.\n\n“That is my punishment!” she cried. “Oh, Lord, if you will give a moth\nlike that into my possession, I'll always be a better woman!”\n\nThe Emperor again came in sight. Pete stood tense and ready. Mrs.\nComstock stepped into the light and watched the moth's course. Then a\nsecond appeared in pursuit of the first. The larger one wavered into the\nradius of light once more. The perspiration rolled down the man's face.\nHe half lifted the hat.\n\n“Pray, woman! Pray now!” he panted.\n\n“I guess I best get over by that lard oil light and go to work,”\n breathed Mrs. Comstock. “The Lord knows this is all in prayer, but it's\nno time for words just now. Ready, Pete! You are going to get a chance\nfirst!”\n\nPete made another long, steady sweep, but the moth darted beneath the\nhat. In its flight it came straight toward Mrs. Comstock. She snatched\noff the remnant of apron she had tucked into her petticoat band and held\nthe calico before her. The moth struck full against it and clung to the\ngoods. Pete crept up stealthily. The second moth followed the first, and\nthe spray showered the apron.\n\n“Wait!” gasped Mrs. Comstock. “I think they have settled. The books say\nthey won't leave now.”\n\nThe big pale yellow creature clung firmly, lowering and raising its\nwings. The other came nearer. Mrs. Comstock held the cloth with rigid\nhands, while Pete could hear her breathing in short gusts.\n\n“Shall I try now?” he implored.\n\n“Wait!” whispered the woman. “Something seems to say wait!”\n\nThe night breeze stiffened and gently waved the apron. Locusts rasped,\nmosquitoes hummed and frogs sang uninterruptedly. A musky odour slowly\nfilled the air.\n\n“Now shall I?” questioned Pete.\n\n“No. Leave them alone. They are safe now. They are mine. They are my\nsalvation. God and the Limberlost gave them to me! They won't move for\nhours. The books all say so. O Heavenly Father, I am thankful to You,\nand you, too, Pete Corson! You are a good man to help me. Now, I can go\nhome and face my girl.”\n\nInstead, Mrs. Comstock dropped suddenly. She spread the apron across\nher knees. The moths remained undisturbed. Then her tired white head\ndropped, the tears she had thought forever dried gushed forth, and she\nsobbed for pure joy.\n\n“Oh, I wouldn't do that now, you know!” comforted Pete. “Think of\ngetting two! That's more than you ever could have expected. A body would\nthink you would cry, if you hadn't got any. Come on, now. It's almost\nmorning. Let me help you home.”\n\nPete took the bag and the two old lanterns. Mrs. Comstock carried her\nmoths and the best lantern and went ahead to light the way.\n\nElnora had sat beside her window far into the night. At last she\nundressed and went to bed, but sleep would not come. She had gone to\nthe city to talk with members of the School Board about a room in the\ngrades. There was a possibility that she might secure the moth, and\nso be able to start to college that fall, but if she did not, then she\nwanted the school. She had been given some encouragement, but she was\nso unhappy that nothing mattered. She could not see the way open to\nanything in life, save a long series of disappointments, while she\nremained with her mother. Yet Margaret Sinton had advised her to go home\nand try once more. Margaret had seemed so sure there would be a change\nfor the better, that Elnora had consented, although she had no hope\nherself. So strong is the bond of blood, she could not make up her mind\nto seek a home elsewhere, even after the day that had passed. Unable to\nsleep she arose at last, and the room being warm, she sat on the floor\nclose the window. The lights in the swamp caught her eye. She was very\nuneasy, for quite a hundred of her best moths were in the case. However,\nthere was no money, and no one ever had touched a book or any of her\napparatus. Watching the lights set her thinking, and before she realized\nit, she was in a panic of fear.\n\nShe hurried down the stairway softly calling her mother. There was no\nanswer. She lightly stepped across the sitting-room and looked in at the\nopen door. There was no one, and the bed had not been used. Her first\nthought was that her mother had gone to the pool; and the Limberlost was\nalive with signals. Pity and fear mingled in the heart of the girl. She\nopened the kitchen door, crossed the garden and ran back to the swamp.\nAs she neared it she listened, but she could hear only the usual voices\nof night.\n\n“Mother!” she called softly. Then louder, “Mother!”\n\nThere was not a sound. Chilled with fright she hurried back to the\ncabin. She did not know what to do. She understood what the lights in\nthe Limberlost meant. Where was her mother? She was afraid to enter,\nwhile she was growing very cold and still more fearful about remaining\noutside. At last she went to her mother's room, picked up the gun,\ncarried it into the kitchen, and crowding in a little corner behind the\nstove, she waited in trembling anxiety. The time was dreadfully long\nbefore she heard her mother's voice. Then she decided some one had been\nill and sent for her, so she took courage, and stepping swiftly across\nthe kitchen she unbarred the door and drew back from sight beside the\ntable.\n\nMrs. Comstock entered dragging her heavy feet. Her dress skirt was gone,\nher petticoat wet and drabbled, and the waist of her dress was almost\ntorn from her body. Her hair hung in damp strings; her eyes were red\nwith crying. In one hand she held the lantern, and in the other stiffly\nextended before her, on a wad of calico reposed a magnificent pair of\nYellow Emperors. Elnora stared, her lips parted.\n\n“Shall I put these others in the kitchen?” inquired a man's voice.\n\nThe girl shrank back to the shadows.\n\n“Yes, anywhere inside the door,” replied Mrs. Comstock as she moved a\nfew steps to make way for him. Pete's head appeared. He set down the\nmoths and was gone.\n\n“Thank you, Pete, more than ever woman thanked you before!” said Mrs.\nComstock.\n\nShe placed the lantern on the table and barred the door. As she turned\nElnora came into view. Mrs. Comstock leaned toward her, and held out\nthe moths. In a voice vibrant with tones never before heard she said:\n“Elnora, my girl, mother's found you another moth!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nWHEREIN MOTHER LOVE IS BESTOWED ON ELNORA, AND SHE FINDS AN ASSISTANT IN\nMOTH HUNTING\n\n\nElnora awoke at dawn and lay gazing around the unfamiliar room. She\nnoticed that every vestige of masculine attire and belongings was gone,\nand knew, without any explanation, what that meant. For some reason\nevery tangible evidence of her father was banished, and she was at last\nto be allowed to take his place. She turned to look at her mother. Mrs.\nComstock's face was white and haggard, but on it rested an expression of\nprofound peace Elnora never before had seen. As she studied the features\non the pillow beside her, the heart of the girl throbbed in tenderness.\nShe realized as fully as any one else could what her mother had\nsuffered. Thoughts of the night brought shuddering fear. She softly\nslipped from the bed, went to her room, dressed and entered the kitchen\nto attend the Emperors and prepare breakfast. The pair had been left\nclinging to the piece of calico. The calico was there and a few pieces\nof beautiful wing. A mouse had eaten the moths!\n\n“Well, of all the horrible luck!” gasped Elnora.\n\nWith the first thought of her mother, she caught up the remnants of the\nmoths, burying them in the ashes of the stove. She took the bag to her\nroom, hurriedly releasing its contents, but there was not another yellow\none. Her mother had said some had been confined in the case in the\nLimberlost. There was still a hope that an Emperor might be among them.\nShe peeped at her mother, who still slept soundly.\n\nElnora took a large piece of mosquito netting, and ran to the swamp.\nThrowing it over the top of the case, she unlocked the door. She reeled,\nfaint with distress. The living moths that had been confined there in\ntheir fluttering to escape to night and the mates they sought not only\nhad wrecked the other specimens of the case, but torn themselves to\nfringes on the pins. A third of the rarest moths of the collection\nfor the man of India were antennaless, legless, wingless, and often\nheadless. Elnora sobbed aloud.\n\n“This is overwhelming,” she said at last. “It is making a fatalist of\nme. I am beginning to think things happen as they are ordained from the\nbeginning, this plainly indicating that there is to be no college, at\nleast, this year, for me. My life is all mountain-top or canon. I wish\nsome one would lead me into a few days of 'green pastures.' Last night I\nwent to sleep on mother's arm, the moths all secured, love and college,\ncertainties. This morning I wake to find all my hopes wrecked. I simply\ndon't dare let mother know that instead of helping me, she has ruined\nmy collection. Everything is gone--unless the love lasts. That actually\nseemed true. I believe I will go see.”\n\nThe love remained. Indeed, in the overflow of the long-hardened, pent-up\nheart, the girl was almost suffocated with tempestuous caresses and\ngenerous offerings. Before the day was over, Elnora realized that she\nnever had known her mother. The woman who now busily went through\nthe cabin, her eyes bright, eager, alert, constantly planning, was a\nstranger. Her very face was different, while it did not seem possible\nthat during one night the acid of twenty years could disappear from a\nvoice and leave it sweet and pleasant.\n\nFor the next few days Elnora worked at mounting the moths her mother had\ntaken. She had to go to the Bird Woman and tell about the disaster, but\nMrs. Comstock was allowed to think that Elnora delivered the moths\nwhen she made the trip. If she had told her what actually happened, the\nchances were that Mrs. Comstock again would have taken possession of the\nLimberlost, hunting there until she replaced all the moths that had been\ndestroyed. But Elnora knew from experience what it meant to collect such\na list in pairs. It would require steady work for at least two summers\nto replace the lost moths. When she left the Bird Woman she went to the\npresident of the Onabasha schools and asked him to do all in his power\nto secure her a room in one of the ward buildings.\n\nThe next morning the last moth was mounted, and the housework finished.\nElnora said to her mother, “If you don't mind, I believe I will go into\nthe woods pasture beside Sleepy Snake Creek and see if I can catch some\ndragonflies or moths.”\n\n“Wait until I get a knife and a pail and I will go along,” answered Mrs.\nComstock. “The dandelions are plenty tender for greens among the deep\ngrasses, and I might just happen to see something myself. My eyes are\npretty sharp.”\n\n“I wish you could realize how young you are,” said Elnora. “I know women\nin Onabasha who are ten years older than you, yet they look twenty years\nyounger. So could you, if you would dress your hair becomingly, and wear\nappropriate clothes.”\n\n“I think my hair puts me in the old woman class permanently,” said Mrs.\nComstock.\n\n“Well, it doesn't!” cried Elnora. “There is a woman of twenty-eight who\nhas hair as white as yours from sick headaches, but her face is young\nand beautiful. If your face would grow a little fuller and those lines\nwould go away, you'd be lovely!”\n\n“You little pig!” laughed Mrs. Comstock. “Any one would think you would\nbe satisfied with having a splinter new mother, without setting up a\nkick on her looks, first thing. Greedy!”\n\n“That is a good word,” said Elnora. “I admit the charge. I am greedy\nover every wasted year. I want you young, lovely, suitably dressed and\nenjoying life like the other girls' mothers.”\n\nMrs. Comstock laughed softly as she pushed back her sunbonnet so that\nshrubs and bushes beside the way could be scanned closely. Elnora walked\nahead with a case over her shoulder, a net in her hand. Her head was\nbare, the rolling collar of her lavender gingham dress was cut in a V\nat the throat, the sleeves only reached the elbows. Every few steps she\npaused and examined the shrubbery carefully, while Mrs. Comstock was\nwatching until her eyes ached, but there were no dandelions in the pail\nshe carried.\n\nEarly June was rioting in fresh grasses, bright flowers, bird songs, and\ngay-winged creatures of air. Down the footpath the two went through the\nperfect morning, the love of God and all nature in their hearts. At\nlast they reached the creek, following it toward the bridge. Here Mrs.\nComstock found a large bed of tender dandelions and stopped to fill\nher pail. Then she sat on the bank, picking over the greens, while she\nlistened to the creek softly singing its June song.\n\nElnora remained within calling distance, and was having good success. At\nlast she crossed the creek, following it up to a bridge. There she began\na careful examination of the under sides of the sleepers and flooring\nfor cocoons. Mrs. Comstock could see her and the creek for several rods\nabove. The mother sat beating the long green leaves across her hand,\ncarefully picking out the white buds, because Elnora liked them, when a\nsplash up the creek attracted her attention.\n\nAround the bend came a man. He was bareheaded, dressed in a white\nsweater, and waders which reached his waist. He walked on the bank, only\nentering the water when forced. He had a queer basket strapped on his\nhip, and with a small rod he sent a long line spinning before him down\nthe creek, deftly manipulating with it a little floating object. He was\ncloser Elnora than her mother, but Mrs. Comstock thought possibly by\nhurrying she could remain unseen and yet warn the girl that a stranger\nwas coming. As she approached the bridge, she caught a sapling and\nleaned over the water to call Elnora. With her lips parted to speak she\nhesitated a second to watch a sort of insect that flashed past on the\nwater, when a splash from the man attracted the girl.\n\nShe was under the bridge, one knee planted in the embankment and a foot\nbraced to support her. Her hair was tousled by wind and bushes, her face\nflushed, and she lifted her arms above her head, working to loosen a\ncocoon she had found. The call Mrs. Comstock had intended to utter never\nfound voice, for as Elnora looked down at the sound, “Possibly I could\nget that for you,” suggested the man.\n\nMrs. Comstock drew back. He was a young man with a wonderfully\nattractive face, although it was too white for robust health, broad\nshoulders, and slender, upright frame.\n\n“Oh, I do hope you can!” answered Elnora. “It's quite a find! It's one\nof those lovely pale red cocoons described in the books. I suspect it\ncomes from having been in a dark place and screened from the weather.”\n\n“Is that so?” cried the man. “Wait a minute. I've never seen one. I\nsuppose it's a Cecropia, from the location.”\n\n“Of course,” said Elnora. “It's so cool here the moth hasn't emerged.\nThe cocoon is a big, baggy one, and it is as red as fox tail.”\n\n“What luck!” he cried. “Are you making a collection?”\n\nHe reeled in his line, laid his rod across a bush and climbed the\nembankment to Elnora's side, produced a knife and began the work of\nwhittling a deep groove around the cocoon.\n\n“Yes. I paid my way through the high school in Onabasha with them. Now I\nam starting a collection which means college.”\n\n“Onabasha!” said the man. “That is where I am visiting. Possibly you\nknow my people--Dr. Ammon's? The doctor is my uncle. My home is in\nChicago. I've been having typhoid fever, something fierce. In the\nhospital six weeks. Didn't gain strength right, so Uncle Doc sent for\nme. I am to live out of doors all summer, and exercise until I get in\ncondition again. Do you know my uncle?”\n\n“Yes. He is Aunt Margaret's doctor, and he would be ours, only we are\nnever ill.”\n\n“Well, you look it!” said the man, appraising Elnora at a glance.\n\n“Strangers always mention it,” sighed Elnora. “I wonder how it would\nseem to be a pale, languid lady and ride in a carriage.”\n\n“Ask me!” laughed the man. “It feels like the--dickens! I'm so proud of\nmy feet. It's quite a trick to stand on them now. I have to keep out\nof the water all I can and stop to baby every half-mile. But with\ninteresting outdoor work I'll be myself in a week.”\n\n“Do you call that work?” Elnora indicated the creek.\n\n“I do, indeed! Nearly three miles, banks too soft to brag on and never a\nstrike. Wouldn't you call that hard labour?”\n\n“Yes,” laughed Elnora. “Work at which you might kill yourself and\nnever get a fish. Did any one tell you there were trout in Sleepy Snake\nCreek?”\n\n“Uncle said I could try.”\n\n“Oh, you can,” said Elnora. “You can try no end, but you'll never get\na trout. This is too far south and too warm for them. If you sit on the\nbank and use worms you might catch some perch or catfish.”\n\n“But that isn't exercise.”\n\n“Well, if you only want exercise, go right on fishing. You will have a\ncreel full of invisible results every night.”\n\n“I object,” said the man emphatically. He stopped work again and studied\nElnora. Even the watching mother could not blame him. In the shade of\nthe bridge Elnora's bright head and her lavender dress made a picture\nworthy of much contemplation.\n\n“I object!” repeated the man. “When I work I want to see results. I'd\nrather exercise sawing wood, making one pile grow little and the other\nbig than to cast all day and catch nothing because there is not a fish\nto take. Work for work's sake doesn't appeal to me.”\n\nHe digged the groove around the cocoon with skilled hand. “Now there is\nsome fun in this!” he said. “It's going to be a fair job to cut it out,\nbut when it comes, it is not only beautiful, but worth a price; it will\nhelp you on your way. I think I'll put up my rod and hunt moths. That\nwould be something like! Don't you want help?”\n\nElnora parried the question. “Have you ever hunted moths, Mr. Ammon?”\n\n“Enough to know the ropes in taking them and to distinguish the\ncommonest ones. I go wild on Catocalae. There's too many of them, all\ntoo much alike for Philip, but I know all these fellows. One flew into\nmy room when I was about ten years old, and we thought it a miracle.\nNone of us ever had seen one so we took it over to the museum to Dr.\nDorsey. He said they were common enough, but we didn't see them because\nthey flew at night. He showed me the museum collection, and I was so\ninterested I took mine back home and started to hunt them. Every year\nafter that we went to our cottage a month earlier, so I could find them,\nand all my family helped. I stuck to it until I went to college. Then,\nkeeping the little moths out of the big ones was too much for the mater,\nso father advised that I donate mine to the museum. He bought a fine\ncase for them with my name on it, which constitutes my sole contribution\nto science. I know enough to help you all right.”\n\n“Aren't you going north this year?”\n\n“All depends on how this fever leaves me. Uncle says the nights are too\ncold and the days too hot there for me. He thinks I had better stay in\nan even temperature until I am strong again. I am going to stick pretty\nclose to him until I know I am. I wouldn't admit it to any one at home,\nbut I was almost gone. I don't believe anything can eat up nerve much\nfaster than the burning of a slow fever. No, thanks, I have enough. I\nstay with Uncle Doc, so if I feel it coming again he can do something\nquickly.”\n\n“I don't blame you,” said Elnora. “I never have been sick, but it must\nbe dreadful. I am afraid you are tiring yourself over that. Let me take\nthe knife awhile.”\n\n“Oh, it isn't so bad as that! I wouldn't be wading creeks if it were. I\nonly need a few more days to get steady on my feet again. I'll soon have\nthis out.”\n\n“It is kind of you to get it,” said Elnora. “I should have had to peel\nit, which would spoil the cocoon for a' specimen and ruin the moth.”\n\n“You haven't said yet whether I may help you while I am here.”\n\nElnora hesitated.\n\n“You better say 'yes,'” he persisted. “It would be a real kindness. It\nwould keep me outdoors all day and give an incentive to work. I'm\ngood at it. I'll show you if I am not in a week or so. I can 'sugar,'\nmanipulate lights, and mirrors, and all the expert methods. I'll wager,\nmoths are numerous in the old swamp over there.”\n\n“They are,” said Elnora. “Most I have I took there. A few nights ago my\nmother caught a number, but we don't dare go alone.”\n\n“All the more reason why you need me. Where do you live? I can't get an\nanswer from you, I'll go tell your mother who I am and ask her if I\nmay help you. I warn you, young lady, I have a very effective way with\nmothers. They almost never turn me down.”\n\n“Then it's probable you will have a new experience when you meet mine,”\n said Elnora. “She never was known to do what any one expected she surely\nwould.”\n\nThe cocoon came loose. Philip Ammon stepped down the embankment turning\nto offer his hand to Elnora. She ran down as she would have done alone,\nand taking the cocoon turned it end for end to learn if the imago it\ncontained were alive. Then Ammon took back the cocoon to smooth the\nedges. Mrs. Comstock gave them one long look as they stood there, and\nreturned to her dandelions. While she worked she paused occasionally,\nlistening intently. Presently they came down the creek, the man carrying\nthe cocoon as if it were a jewel, while Elnora made her way along the\nbank, taking a lesson in casting. Her face was flushed with excitement,\nher eyes shining, the bushes taking liberties with her hair. For a\npicture of perfect loveliness she scarcely could have been surpassed,\nand the eyes of Philip Ammon seemed to be in working order.\n\n“Moth-er!” called Elnora.\n\nThere was an undulant, caressing sweetness in the girl's voice, as she\nsung out the call in perfect confidence that it would bring a loving\nanswer, that struck deep in Mrs. Comstock's heart. She never had heard\nthat word so pronounced before and a lump arose in her throat.\n\n“Here!” she answered, still cleaning dandelions.\n\n“Mother, this is Mr. Philip Ammon, of Chicago,” said Elnora. “He has\nbeen ill and he is staying with Dr. Ammon in Onabasha. He came down the\ncreek fishing and cut this cocoon from under the bridge for me. He feels\nthat it would be better to hunt moths than to fish, until he is well.\nWhat do you think about it?”\n\nPhilip Ammon extended his hand. “I am glad to know you,” he said.\n\n“You may take the hand-shaking for granted,” replied Mrs. Comstock.\n“Dandelions have a way of making fingers sticky, and I like to know\na man before I take his hand, anyway. That introduction seems mighty\ncomprehensive on your part, but it still leaves me unclassified. My name\nis Comstock.”\n\nPhilip Ammon bowed.\n\n“I am sorry to hear you have been sick,” said Mrs. Comstock. “But if\npeople will live where they have such vile water as they do in Chicago,\nI don't see what else they are to expect.”\n\nPhilip studied her intently.\n\n“I am sure I didn't have a fever on purpose,” he said.\n\n“You do seem a little wobbly on your legs,” she observed. “Maybe you\nhad better sit and rest while I finish these greens. It's late for\nthe genuine article, but in the shade, among long grass they are still\ntender.”\n\n“May I have a leaf?” he asked, reaching for one as he sat on the bank,\nlooking from the little creek at his feet, away through the dim cool\nspaces of the June forest on the opposite side. He drew a deep breath.\n“Glory, but this is good after almost two months inside hospital walls!”\n\nHe stretched on the grass and lay gazing up at the leaves, occasionally\nasking the interpretation of a bird note or the origin of an unfamiliar\nforest voice. Elnora began helping with the dandelions.\n\n“Another, please,” said the young man, holding out his hand.\n\n“Do you suppose this is the kind of grass Nebuchadnezzar ate?” Elnora\nasked, giving the leaf.\n\n“He knew a good thing if it is.”\n\n“Oh, you should taste dandelions boiled with bacon and served with\nmother's cornbread.”\n\n“Don't! My appetite is twice my size now. While it is--how far is it to\nOnabasha, shortest cut?”\n\n“Three miles.”\n\nThe man lay in perfect content, nibbling leaves.\n\n“This surely is a treat,” he said. “No wonder you find good hunting\nhere. There seems to be foliage for almost every kind of caterpillar.\nBut I suppose you have to exchange for northern species and Pacific\nCoast kinds?”\n\n“Yes. And every one wants Regalis in trade. I never saw the like. They\nconsider a Cecropia or a Polyphemus an insult, and a Luna is barely\nacceptable.”\n\n“What authorities have you?”\n\nElnora began to name text-books which started a discussion. Mrs.\nComstock listened. She cleaned dandelions with greater deliberation than\nthey ever before were examined. In reality she was taking stock of the\nyoung man's long, well-proportioned frame, his strong hands, his smooth,\nfine-textured skin, his thick shock of dark hair, and making mental\nnotes of his simple manly speech and the fact that he evidently did\nknow much about moths. It pleased her to think that if he had been a\nneighbour boy who had lain beside her every day of his life while she\nworked, he could have been no more at home. She liked the things he\nsaid, but she was proud that Elnora had a ready answer which always\nseemed appropriate.\n\nAt last Mrs. Comstock finished the greens.\n\n“You are three miles from the city and less than a mile from where we\nlive,” she said. “If you will tell me what you dare eat, I suspect you\nhad best go home with us and rest until the cool of the day before you\nstart back. Probably some one that you can ride in with will be passing\nbefore evening.”\n\n“That is mighty kind of you,” said Philip. “I think I will. It doesn't\nmatter so much what I eat, the point is that I must be moderate. I am\nhungry all the time.”\n\n“Then we will go,” said Mrs. Comstock, “and we will not allow you to\nmake yourself sick with us.”\n\nPhilip Ammon arose: picking up the pail of greens and his fishing rod,\nhe stood waiting. Elnora led the way. Mrs. Comstock motioned Philip to\nfollow and she walked in the rear. The girl carried the cocoon and the\nbox of moths she had taken, searching every step for more. The young man\nfrequently set down his load to join in the pursuit of a dragonfly or\nmoth, while Mrs. Comstock watched the proceedings with sharp eyes. Every\ntime Philip picked up the pail of greens she struggled to suppress a\nsmile.\n\nElnora proceeded slowly, chattering about everything beside the trail.\nPhilip was interested in all the objects she pointed out, noticing\nseveral things which escaped her. He carried the greens as casually\nwhen they took a short cut down the roadway as on the trail. When Elnora\nturned toward the gate of her home Philip Ammon stopped, took a long\nlook at the big hewed log cabin, the vines which clambered over it,\nthe flower garden ablaze with beds of bright bloom interspersed with\nstrawberries and tomatoes, the trees of the forest rising north and west\nlike a green wall and exclaimed: “How beautiful!”\n\nMrs. Comstock was pleased. “If you think that,” she said, “perhaps you\nwill understand how, in all this present-day rush to be modern, I have\npreferred to remain as I began. My husband and I took up this land, and\nenough trees to build the cabin, stable, and outbuildings are nearly all\nwe ever cut. Of course, if he had lived, I suppose we should have kept\nup with our neighbours. I hear considerable about the value of the land,\nthe trees which are on it, and the oil which is supposed to be under it,\nbut as yet I haven't brought myself to change anything. So we stand for\none of the few remaining homes of first settlers in this region. Come\nin. You are very welcome to what we have.”\n\nMrs. Comstock stepped forward and took the lead. She had a bowl of\nsoft water and a pair of boots to offer for the heavy waders, for outer\ncomfort, a glass of cold buttermilk and a bench on which to rest, in\nthe circular arbour until dinner was ready. Philip Ammon splashed in\nthe water. He followed to the stable and exchanged boots there. He was\nravenous for the buttermilk, and when he stretched on the bench in the\narbour the flickering patches of sunlight so tantalized his tired eyes,\nwhile the bees made such splendid music, he was soon sound asleep. When\nElnora and her mother came out with a table they stood a short time\nlooking at him. It is probable Mrs. Comstock voiced a united thought\nwhen she said: “What a refined, decent looking young man! How proud his\nmother must be of him! We must be careful what we let him eat.”\n\nThen they returned to the kitchen where Mrs. Comstock proceeded to be\ncareful. She broiled ham of her own sugar-curing, creamed potatoes,\nserved asparagus on toast, and made a delicious strawberry shortcake.\nAs she cooked dandelions with bacon, she feared to serve them to him, so\nshe made an excuse that it took too long to prepare them, blanched some\nand made a salad. When everything was ready she touched Philip's sleeve.\n\n“Best have something to eat, lad, before you get too hungry,” she said.\n\n“Please hurry!” he begged laughingly as he held a plate toward her to be\nfilled. “I thought I had enough self-restraint to start out alone, but\nI see I was mistaken. If you would allow me, just now, I am afraid I\nshould start a fever again. I never did smell food so good as this. It's\nmighty kind of you to take me in. I hope I will be man enough in a few\ndays to do something worth while in return.”\n\nSpots of sunshine fell on the white cloth and blue china, the bees and\nan occasional stray butterfly came searching for food. A rose-breasted\ngrosbeak, released from a three hours' siege of brooding, while his\nindependent mate took her bath and recreation, mounted the top branch of\na maple in the west woods from which he serenaded the dinner party with\na joyful chorus in celebration of his freedom. Philip's eyes strayed to\nthe beautiful cabin, to the mixture of flowers and vegetables stretching\ndown to the road, and to the singing bird with his red-splotched breast\nof white and he said: “I can't realize now that I ever lay in ice packs\nin a hospital. How I wish all the sick folks could come here to grow\nstrong!”\n\nThe grosbeak sang on, a big Turnus butterfly sailed through the arbour\nand poised over the table. Elnora held up a lump of sugar and the\nbutterfly, clinging to her fingers, tasted daintily. With eager eyes and\nparted lips, the girl held steadily. When at last it wavered away, “That\nmade a picture!” said Philip. “Ask me some other time how I lost my\nillusions concerning butterflies. I always thought of them in connection\nwith sunshine, flower pollen, and fruit nectar, until one sad day.”\n\n“I know!” laughed Elnora. “I've seen that, too, but it didn't destroy\nany illusion for me. I think quite as much of the butterflies as ever.”\n\nThen they talked of flowers, moths, dragonflies, Indian relics, and all\nthe natural wonders the swamp afforded, straying from those subjects\nto books and school work. When they cleared the table Philip assisted,\ncarrying several tray loads to the kitchen. He and Elnora mounted\nspecimens while Mrs Comstock washed the dishes. Then she came out with a\nruffle she was embroidering.\n\n“I wonder if I did not see a picture of you in Onabasha last night,”\n Philip said to Elnora. “Aunt Anna took me to call on Miss Brownlee. She\nwas showing me her crowd--of course, it was you! But it didn't half\ndo you justice, although it was the nearest human of any of them. Miss\nBrownlee is very fond of you. She said the finest things.”\n\nThen they talked of Commencement, and at last Philip said he must go or\nhis friends would become anxious about him.\n\nMrs. Comstock brought him a blue bowl of creamy milk and a plate of\nbread. She stopped a passing team and secured a ride to the city for\nhim, as his exercise of the morning had been too violent, and he was\nforced to admit he was tired.\n\n“May I come to-morrow afternoon and hunt moths awhile?” he asked Mrs.\nComstock as he arose. “We will 'sugar' a tree and put a light beside it,\nif I can get stuff to make the preparation. Possibly we can take some\nthat way. I always enjoy moth hunting, I'd like to help Miss Elnora, and\nit would be a charity to me. I've got to remain outdoors some place, and\nI'm quite sure I'd get well faster here than anywhere else. Please say I\nmay come.”\n\n“I have no objections, if Elnora really would like help,” said Mrs.\nComstock.\n\nIn her heart she wished he would not come. She wanted her newly found\ntreasure all to herself, for a time, at least. But Elnora's were eager,\nshining eyes. She thought it would be splendid to have help, and great\nfun to try book methods for taking moths, so it was arranged. As Philip\nrode away, Mrs. Comstock's eyes followed him. “What a nice young man!”\n she said.\n\n“He seems fine,” agreed Elnora.\n\n“He comes of a good family, too. I've often heard of his father. He is a\ngreat lawyer.”\n\n“I am glad he likes it here. I need help. Possibly----”\n\n“Possibly what?”\n\n“We can find many moths.”\n\n“What did he mean about the butterflies?”\n\n“That he always had connected them with sunshine, flowers, and fruits,\nand thought of them as the most exquisite of creations; then one day he\nfound some clustering thickly over carrion.”\n\n“Come to think of it, I have seen butterflies----”\n\n“So had he,” laughed Elnora. “And that is what he meant.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nWHEREIN A NEW POSITION IS TENDERED ELNORA, AND PHILIP AMMON IS SHOWN\nLIMBERLOST VIOLETS\n\n\nThe next morning Mrs. Comstock called to Elnora, “The mail carrier\nstopped at our box.”\n\nElnora ran down the walk and came back carrying an official letter. She\ntore it open and read:\n\nMY DEAR MISS COMSTOCK:\n\nAt the weekly meeting of the Onabasha School Board last night, it was\ndecided to add the position of Lecturer on Natural History to our corps\nof city teachers. It will be the duty of this person to spend two hours\na week in each of the grade schools exhibiting and explaining specimens\nof the most prominent objects in nature: animals, birds, insects,\nflowers, vines, shrubs, bushes, and trees. These specimens and lectures\nshould be appropriate to the seasons and the comprehension of the\ngrades. This position was unanimously voted to you. I think you will\nfind the work delightful and much easier than the routine grind of the\nother teachers. It is my advice that you accept and begin to prepare\nyourself at once. Your salary will be $750 a year, and you will be\nallowed $200 for expenses in procuring specimens and books. Let us know\nat once if you want the position, as it is going to be difficult to fill\nsatisfactorily if you do not.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nDAVID THOMPSON, President, Onabasha Schools.\n\n\n“I hardly understand,” marvelled Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“It is a new position. They never have had anything like it before. I\nsuspect it arose from the help I've been giving the grade teachers in\ntheir nature work. They are trying to teach the children something, and\nhalf the instructors don't know a blue jay from a king-fisher, a beech\nleaf from an elm, or a wasp from a hornet.”\n\n“Well, do you?” anxiously inquired Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“Indeed, I do!” laughed Elnora, “and several other things beside. When\nFreckles bequeathed me the swamp, he gave me a bigger inheritance than\nhe knew. While you have thought I was wandering aimlessly, I have been\nfollowing a definite plan, studying hard, and storing up the stuff that\nwill earn these seven hundred and fifty dollars. Mother dear, I am going\nto accept this, of course. The work will be a delight. I'd love it most\nof anything in teaching. You must help me. We must find nests, eggs,\nleaves, queer formations in plants and rare flowers. I must have flower\nboxes made for each of the rooms and filled with wild things. I should\nbegin to gather specimens this very day.”\n\nElnora's face was flushed and her eyes bright.\n\n“Oh, what great work that will be!” she cried. “You must go with me so\nyou can see the little faces when I tell them how the goldfinch builds\nits nest, and how the bees make honey.”\n\nSo Elnora and her mother went into the woods behind the cabin to study\nnature.\n\n“I think,” said Elnora, “the idea is to begin with fall things in the\nfall, keeping to the seasons throughout the year.”\n\n“What are fall things?” inquired Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“Oh, fringed gentians, asters, ironwort, every fall flower, leaves\nfrom every tree and vine, what makes them change colour, abandoned bird\nnests, winter quarters of caterpillars and insects, what becomes of the\nbutterflies and grasshoppers--myriads of stuff. I shall have to be very\nwise to select the things it will be most beneficial for the children to\nlearn.”\n\n“Can I really help you?” Mrs. Comstock's strong face was pathetic.\n\n“Indeed, yes!” cried Elnora. “I never can get through it alone. There\nwill be an immense amount of work connected with securing and preparing\nspecimens.”\n\nMrs. Comstock lifted her head proudly and began doing business at once.\nHer sharp eyes ranged from earth to heaven. She investigated everything,\nasking innumerable questions. At noon Mrs. Comstock took the specimens\nthey had collected, and went to prepare dinner, while Elnora followed\nthe woods down to the Sintons' to show her letter.\n\nShe had to explain what became of her moths, and why college would have\nto be abandoned for that year, but Margaret and Wesley vowed not to\ntell. Wesley waved the letter excitedly, explaining it to Margaret as\nif it were a personal possession. Margaret was deeply impressed, while\nBilly volunteered first aid in gathering material.\n\n“Now anything you want in the ground, Snap can dig it out,” he said.\n“Uncle Wesley and I found a hole three times as big as Snap, that he dug\nat the roots of a tree.”\n\n“We will train him to hunt pupae cases,” said Elnora.\n\n“Are you going to the woods this afternoon?” asked Billy.\n\n“Yes,” answered Elnora. “Dr. Ammon's nephew from Chicago is visiting in\nOnabasha. He is going to show me how men put some sort of compound on\na tree, hang a light beside it, and take moths that way. It will be\ninteresting to watch and learn.”\n\n“May I come?” asked Billy.\n\n“Of course you may come!” answered Elnora.\n\n“Is this nephew of Dr. Ammon a young man?” inquired Margaret.\n\n“About twenty-six, I should think,” said Elnora. “He said he had been\nout of college and at work in his father's law office three years.”\n\n“Does he seem nice?” asked Margaret, and Wesley smiled.\n\n“Finest kind of a person,” said Elnora. “He can teach me so much. It\nis very interesting to hear him talk. He knows considerable about moths\nthat will be a help to me. He had a fever and he has to stay outdoors\nuntil he grows strong again.”\n\n“Billy, I guess you better help me this afternoon,” said Margaret.\n“Maybe Elnora had rather not bother with you.”\n\n“There's no reason on earth why Billy should not come!” cried Elnora,\nand Wesley smiled again.\n\n“I must hurry home or I won't be ready,” she added.\n\nHastening down the road she entered the cabin, her face glowing.\n\n“I thought you never would come,” said Mrs. Comstock. “If you don't\nhurry Mr. Ammon will be here before you are dressed.”\n\n“I forgot about him until just now,” said Elnora. “I am not going to\ndress. He's not coming to visit. We are only going to the woods for more\nspecimens. I can't wear anything that requires care. The limbs take the\nmost dreadful liberties with hair and clothing.”\n\nMrs. Comstock opened her lips, looked at Elnora and closed them. In her\nheart she was pleased that the girl was so interested in her work that\nshe had forgotten Philip Ammon's coming. But it did seem to her that\nsuch a pleasant young man should have been greeted by a girl in a fresh\ndress. “If she isn't disposed to primp at the coming of a man, heaven\nforbid that I should be the one to start her,” thought Mrs. Comstock.\n\nPhilip came whistling down the walk between the cinnamon pinks, pansies,\nand strawberries. He carried several packages, while his face flushed\nwith more colour than on the previous day.\n\n“Only see what has happened to me!” cried Elnora, offering her letter.\n\n“I'll wager I know!” answered Philip. “Isn't it great! Every one in\nOnabasha is talking about it. At last there is something new under the\nsun. All of them are pleased. They think you'll make a big success. This\nwill give an incentive to work. In a few days more I'll be myself again,\nand we'll overturn the fields and woods around here.”\n\nHe went on to congratulate Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“Aren't you proud of her, though?” he asked. “You should hear what folks\nare saying! They say she created the necessity for the position, and\nevery one seems to feel that it is a necessity. Now, if she succeeds,\nand she will, all of the other city schools will have such departments,\nand first thing you know she will have made the whole world a little\nbetter. Let me rest a few seconds; my feet are acting up again. Then we\nwill cook the moth compound and put it to cool.”\n\nHe laughed as he sat breathing shortly.\n\n“It doesn't seem possible that a fellow could lose his strength like\nthis. My knees are actually trembling, but I'll be all right in a\nminute. Uncle Doc said I could come. I told him how you took care of me,\nand he said I would be safe here.”\n\nThen he began unwrapping packages and explaining to Mrs. Comstock how\nto cook the compound to attract the moths. He followed her into the\nkitchen, kindled the fire, and stirred the preparation as he talked.\nWhile the mixture cooled, he and Elnora walked through the vegetable\ngarden behind the cabin and strayed from there into the woods.\n\n“What about college?” he asked. “Miss Brownlee said you were going.”\n\n“I had hoped to,” replied Elnora, “but I had a streak of dreadful luck,\nso I'll have to wait until next year. If you won't speak of it, I'll\ntell you.”\n\nPhilip promised, so Elnora recited the history of the Yellow Emperor.\nShe was so interested in doing the Emperor justice she did not notice\nhow many personalities went into the story. A few pertinent questions\ntold him the remainder. He looked at the girl in wonder. In face and\nform she was as lovely as any one of her age and type he ever had seen.\nHer school work far surpassed that of most girls of her age he knew.\nShe differed in other ways. This vast store of learning she had\ngathered from field and forest was a wealth of attraction no other girl\npossessed. Her frank, matter-of-fact manner was an inheritance from her\nmother, but there was something more. Once, as they talked he thought\n“sympathy” was the word to describe it and again “comprehension.” She\nseemed to possess a large sense of brotherhood for all human and animate\ncreatures. She spoke to him as if she had known him all her life.\nShe talked to the grosbeak in exactly the same manner, as she laid\nstrawberries and potato bugs on the fence for his family. She did\nnot swerve an inch from her way when a snake slid past her, while the\nsquirrels came down from the trees and took corn from her fingers.\nShe might as well have been a boy, so lacking was she in any touch of\nfeminine coquetry toward him. He studied her wonderingly. As they went\nalong the path they reached a large slime-covered pool surrounded by\ndecaying stumps and logs thickly covered with water hyacinths and blue\nflags. Philip stopped.\n\n“Is that the place?” he asked.\n\nElnora assented. “The doctor told you?”\n\n“Yes. It was tragic. Is that pool really bottomless?”\n\n“So far as we ever have been able to discover.”\n\nPhilip stood looking at the water, while the long, sweet grasses,\nthickly sprinkled with blue flag bloom, over which wild bees clambered,\nswayed around his feet. Then he turned to the girl. She had worked hard.\nThe same lavender dress she had worn the previous day clung to her in\nlimp condition. But she was as evenly coloured and of as fine grain as\na wild rose petal, her hair was really brown, but never was such hair\ntouched with a redder glory, while her heavy arching brows added a look\nof strength to her big gray-blue eyes.\n\n“And you were born here?”\n\nHe had not intended to voice that thought.\n\n“Yes,” she said, looking into his eyes. “Just in time to prevent my\nmother from saving the life of my father. She came near never forgiving\nme.”\n\n“Ah, cruel!” cried Philip.\n\n“I find much in life that is cruel, from our standpoints,” said Elnora.\n“It takes the large wisdom of the Unfathomable, the philosophy of the\nAlmighty, to endure some of it. But there is always right somewhere, and\nat last it seems to come.”\n\n“Will it come to you?” asked Philip, who found himself deeply affected.\n\n“It has come,” said the girl serenely. “It came a week ago. It came in\nfullest measure when my mother ceased to regret that I had been born.\nNow, work that I love has come--that should constitute happiness. A\nlittle farther along is my violet bed. I want you to see it.”\n\nAs Philip Ammon followed he definitely settled upon the name of the\nunusual feature of Elnora's face. It should be called “experience.”\n She had known bitter experiences early in life. Suffering had been\nher familiar more than joy. He watched her earnestly, his heart deeply\nmoved. She led him into a swampy half-open space in the woods, stopped\nand stepped aside. He uttered a cry of surprised delight.\n\nA few decaying logs were scattered around, the grass grew in tufts long\nand fine. Blue flags waved, clusters of cowslips nodded gold heads, but\nthe whole earth was purple with a thick blanket of violets nodding from\nstems a foot in length. Elnora knelt and slipping her fingers between\nthe leaves and grasses to the roots, gathered a few violets and gave\nthem to Philip.\n\n“Can your city greenhouses surpass them?” she asked.\n\nHe sat on a log to examine the blooms.\n\n“They are superb!” he said. “I never saw such length of stem or such\nrank leaves, while the flowers are the deepest blue, the truest violet\nI ever saw growing wild. They are coloured exactly like the eyes of the\ngirl I am going to marry.”\n\nElnora handed him several others to add to those he held. “She must have\nwonderful eyes,” she commented.\n\n“No other blue eyes are quite so beautiful,” he said. “In fact, she is\naltogether lovely.”\n\n“Is it customary for a man to think the girl he is going to marry\nlovely? I wonder if I should find her so.”\n\n“You would,” said Philip. “No one ever fails to. She is tall as you,\nvery slender, but perfectly rounded; you know about her eyes; her hair\nis black and wavy--while her complexion is clear and flushed with red.”\n\n“Why, she must be the most beautiful girl in the whole world!” she\ncried.\n\n“No, indeed!” he said. “She is not a particle better looking in her way\nthan you are in yours. She is a type of dark beauty, but you are equally\nas perfect. She is unusual in her combination of black hair and violet\neyes, although every one thinks them black at a little distance. You\nare quite as unusual with your fair face, black brows, and brown hair;\nindeed, I know many people who would prefer your bright head to her dark\none. It's all a question of taste--and being engaged to the girl,” he\nadded.\n\n“That would be likely to prejudice one,” laughed Elnora.\n\n“Edith has a birthday soon; if these last will you let me have a box of\nthem to send her?”\n\n“I will help gather and pack them for you, so they will carry nicely.\nDoes she hunt moths with you?”\n\nBack went Philip Ammon's head in a gale of laughter.\n\n“No!” he cried. “She says they are 'creepy.' She would go into a spasm\nif she were compelled to touch those caterpillars I saw you handling\nyesterday.”\n\n“Why would she?” marvelled Elnora. “Haven't you told her that they are\nperfectly clean, helpless, and harmless as so much animate velvet?”\n\n“No, I have not told her. She wouldn't care enough about caterpillars to\nlisten.”\n\n“In what is she interested?”\n\n“What interests Edith Carr? Let me think! First, I believe she takes\npride in being a little handsomer and better dressed than any girl\nof her set. She is interested in having a beautiful home, fine\nappointments, in being petted, praised, and the acknowledged leader of\nsociety.\n\n“She likes to find new things which amuse her, and to always and in all\ncircumstances have her own way about everything.”\n\n“Good gracious!” cried Elnora, staring at him. “But what does she do?\nHow does she spend her time?”\n\n“Spend her time!” repeated Philip. “Well, she would call that a joke.\nHer days are never long enough. There is endless shopping, to find\nthe pretty things; regular visits to the dressmakers, calls, parties,\ntheatres, entertainments. She is always rushed. I never am able to be\nwith her half as much as I would like.”\n\n“But I mean work,” persisted Elnora. “In what is she interested that is\nuseful to the world?”\n\n“Me!” cried Philip promptly.\n\n“I can understand that,” laughed Elnora. “What I can't understand is\nhow you can be in----” She stopped in confusion, but she saw that he\nhad finished the sentence as she had intended. “I beg your pardon!”\n she cried. “I didn't intend to say that. But I cannot understand these\npeople I hear about who live only for their own amusement. Perhaps it is\nvery great; I'll never have a chance to know. To me, it seems the only\npleasure in this world worth having is the joy we derive from living for\nthose we love, and those we can help. I hope you are not angry with me.”\n\nPhilip sat silently looking far away, with deep thought in his eyes.\n\n“You are angry,” faltered Elnora.\n\nHis look came back to her as she knelt before him among the flowers and\nhe gazed at her steadily.\n\n“No doubt I should be,” he said, “but the fact is I am not. I cannot\nunderstand a life purely for personal pleasure myself. But she is only\na girl, and this is her playtime. When she is a woman in her own home,\nthen she will be different, will she not?”\n\nElnora never resembled her mother so closely as when she answered that\nquestion.\n\n“I would have to be well acquainted with her to know, but I should hope\nso. To make a real home for a tired business man is a very different\nkind of work from that required to be a leader of society. It demands\ndifferent talent and education. Of course, she means to change, or she\nwould not have promised to make a home for you. I suspect our dope is\ncool now, let's go try for some butterflies.”\n\nAs they went along the path together Elnora talked of many things but\nPhilip answered absently. Evidently he was thinking of something else.\nBut the moth bait recalled him and he was ready for work as they made\ntheir way back to the woods. He wanted to try the Limberlost, but Elnora\nwas firm about remaining on home ground. She did not tell him that\nlights hung in the swamp would be a signal to call up a band of men\nwhose presence she dreaded. So they started, Ammon carrying the dope,\nElnora the net, Billy and Mrs. Comstock following with cyanide boxes and\nlanterns.\n\nFirst they tried for butterflies and captured several fine ones without\ntrouble. They also called swarms of ants, bees, beetles, and flies. When\nit grew dusk, Mrs. Comstock and Philip went to prepare supper. Elnora\nand Billy remained until the butterflies disappeared. Then they lighted\nthe lanterns, repainted the trees and followed the home trail.\n\n“Do you 'spec you'll get just a lot of moths?” asked Billy, as he walked\nbeside Elnora.\n\n“I am sure I hardly know,” said the girl. “This is a new way for me.\nPerhaps they will come to the lights, but few moths eat; and I have some\ndoubt about those which the lights attract settling on the right trees.\nMaybe the smell of that dope will draw them. Between us, Billy, I think\nI like my old way best. If I can find a hidden moth, slip up and catch\nit unawares, or take it in full flight, it's my captive, and I can keep\nit until it dies naturally. But this way you seem to get it under\nfalse pretences, it has no chance, and it will probably ruin its wings\nstruggling for freedom before morning.”\n\n“Well, any moth ought to be proud to be taken anyway, by you,” said\nBilly. “Just look what you do! You can make everybody love them. People\neven quit hating caterpillars when they see you handle them and hear\nyou tell all about them. You must have some to show people how they are.\nIt's not like killing things to see if you can, or because you want to\neat them, the way most men kill birds. I think it is right for you to\ntake enough for collections, to show city people, and to illustrate\nthe Bird Woman's books. You go on and take them! The moths don't care.\nThey're glad to have you. They like it!”\n\n“Billy, I see your future,” said Elnora. “We will educate you and send\nyou up to Mr. Ammon to make a great lawyer. You'd beat the world as a\nspecial pleader. You actually make me feel that I am doing the moths a\nkindness to take them.”\n\n“And so you are!” cried Billy. “Why, just from what you have taught\nthem Uncle Wesley and Aunt Margaret never think of killing a caterpillar\nuntil they look whether it's the beautiful June moth kind, or the horrid\ntent ones. That's what you can do. You go straight ahead!”\n\n“Billy, you are a jewel!” cried Elnora, throwing her arm across his\nshoulders as they came down the path.\n\n“My, I was scared!” said Billy with a deep breath.\n\n“Scared?” questioned Elnora.\n\n“Yes sir-ee! Aunt Margaret scared me. May I ask you a question?”\n\n“Of course, you may!”\n\n“Is that man going to be your beau?”\n\n“Billy! No! What made you think such a thing?”\n\n“Aunt Margaret said likely he would fall in love with you, and you\nwouldn't want me around any more. Oh, but I was scared! It isn't so, is\nit?”\n\n“Indeed, no!”\n\n“I am your beau, ain't I?”\n\n“Surely you are!” said Elnora, tightening her arm.\n\n“I do hope Aunt Kate has ginger cookies,” said Billy with a little skip\nof delight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nWHEREIN MRS. COMSTOCK FACES THE ALMIGHTY, AND PHILIP AMMON WRITES A\nLETTER\n\n\nMrs. Comstock and Elnora were finishing breakfast the following morning\nwhen they heard a cheery whistle down the road. Elnora with surprised\neyes looked at her mother.\n\n“Could that be Mr. Ammon?” she questioned.\n\n“I did not expect him so soon,” commented Mrs. Comstock.\n\nIt was sunrise, but the musician was Philip Ammon. He appeared stronger\nthan on yesterday.\n\n“I hope I am not too early,” he said. “I am consumed with anxiety to\nlearn if we have made a catch. If we have, we should beat the birds to\nit. I promised Uncle Doc to put on my waders and keep dry for a few days\nyet, when I go to the woods. Let's hurry! I am afraid of crows. There\nmight be a rare moth.”\n\nThe sun was topping the Limberlost when they started. As they neared the\nplace Philip stopped.\n\n“Now we must use great caution,” he said. “The lights and the odours\nalways attract numbers that don't settle on the baited trees. Every\nbush, shrub, and limb may hide a specimen we want.”\n\nSo they approached with much care.\n\n“There is something, anyway!” cried Philip.\n\n“There are moths! I can see them!” exulted Elnora.\n\n“Those you see are fast enough. It's the ones for which you must search\nthat will escape. The grasses are dripping, and I have boots, so you\nlook beside the path while I take the outside,” suggested Ammon.\n\nMrs. Comstock wanted to hunt moths, but she was timid about making a\nwrong movement, so she wisely sat on a log and watched Philip and Elnora\nto learn how they proceeded. Back in the deep woods a hermit thrush was\nsinging his chant to the rising sun. Orioles were sowing the pure, sweet\nair with notes of gold, poured out while on wing. The robins were only\nchirping now, for their morning songs had awakened all the other birds\nan hour ago. Scolding red-wings tilted on half the bushes. Excepting\nlate species of haws, tree bloom was almost gone, but wild flowers made\nthe path border and all the wood floor a riot of colour. Elnora, born\namong such scenes, worked eagerly, but to the city man, recently from a\nhospital, they seemed too good to miss. He frequently stooped to examine\na flower face, paused to listen intently to the thrush or lifted his\nhead to see the gold flash which accompanied the oriole's trailing\nnotes. So Elnora uttered the first cry, as she softly lifted branches\nand peered among the grasses.\n\n“My find!” she called. “Bring the box, mother!”\n\nPhilip came hurrying also. When they reached her she stood on the path\nholding a pair of moths. Her eyes were wide with excitement, her cheeks\npink, her red lips parted, and on the hand she held out to them clung\na pair of delicate blue-green moths, with white bodies, and touches of\nlavender and straw colour. All around her lay flower-brocaded grasses,\nbehind the deep green background of the forest, while the sun slowly\nsifted gold from heaven to burnish her hair. Mrs. Comstock heard a sharp\nbreath behind her.\n\n“Oh, what a picture!” exulted Philip at her shoulder. “She is absolutely\nand altogether lovely! I'd give a small fortune for that faithfully set\non canvas!”\n\nHe picked the box from Mrs. Comstock's fingers and slowly advanced with\nit. Elnora held down her hand and transferred the moths. Philip closed\nthe box carefully, but the watching mother saw that his eyes were\nfollowing the girl's face. He was not making the slightest attempt to\nconceal his admiration.\n\n“I wonder if a woman ever did anything lovelier than to find a pair of\nLuna moths on a forest path, early on a perfect June morning,” he said\nto Mrs. Comstock, when he returned the box.\n\nShe glanced at Elnora who was intently searching the bushes.\n\n“Look here, young man,” said Mrs. Comstock. “You seem to find that girl\nof mine about right.”\n\n“I could suggest no improvement,” said Philip. “I never saw a more\nattractive girl anywhere. She seems absolutely perfect to me.”\n\n“Then suppose you don't start any scheme calculated to spoil her!”\n proposed Mrs. Comstock dryly. “I don't think you can, or that any man\ncould, but I'm not taking any risks. You asked to come here to help\nin this work. We are both glad to have you, if you confine yourself to\nwork; but it's the least you can do to leave us as you find us.”\n\n“I beg your pardon!” said Philip. “I intended no offence. I admire her\nas I admire any perfect creation.”\n\n“And nothing in all this world spoils the average girl so quickly and\nso surely,” said Mrs. Comstock. She raised her voice. “Elnora, fasten up\nthat tag of hair over your left ear. These bushes muss you so you remind\nme of a sheep poking its nose through a hedge fence.”\n\nMrs. Comstock started down the path toward the log again, when she\nreached it she called sharply: “Elnora, come here! I believe I have\nfound something myself.”\n\nThe “something” was a Citheronia Regalis which had emerged from its case\non the soft earth under the log. It climbed up the wood, its stout legs\ndragging a big pursy body, while it wildly flapped tiny wings the size\nof a man's thumb-nail. Elnora gave one look and a cry which brought\nPhilip.\n\n“That's the rarest moth in America!” he announced. “Mrs. Comstock,\nyou've gone up head. You can put that in a box with a screen cover\nto-night, and attract half a dozen, possibly.”\n\n“Is it rare, Elnora?” inquired Mrs. Comstock, as if no one else knew.\n\n“It surely is,” answered Elnora. “If we can find it a mate to-night,\nit will lay from two hundred and fifty to three hundred eggs to-morrow.\nWith any luck at all I can raise two hundred caterpillars from them. I\ndid once before. And they are worth a dollar apiece.”\n\n“Was the one I killed like that?”\n\n“No. That was a different moth, but its life processes were the same as\nthis. The Bird Woman calls this the King of the Poets.”\n\n“Why does she?”\n\n“Because it is named for Citheron who was a poet, and regalis refers\nto a king. You mustn't touch it or you may stunt wing development. You\nwatch and don't let that moth out of sight, or anything touch it. When\nthe wings are expanded and hardened we will put it in a box.”\n\n“I am afraid it will race itself to death,” objected Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“That's a part of the game,” said Philip. “It is starting circulation\nnow. When the right moment comes, it will stop and expand its wings. If\nyou watch closely you can see them expand.”\n\nPresently the moth found a rough projection of bark and clung with its\nfeet, back down, its wings hanging. The body was an unusual orange red,\nthe tiny wings were gray, striped with the red and splotched here\nand there with markings of canary yellow. Mrs. Comstock watched\nbreathlessly. Presently she slipped from the log and knelt to secure a\nbetter view.\n\n“Are its wings developing?” called Elnora.\n\n“They are growing larger and the markings coming stronger every minute.”\n\n“Let's watch, too,” said Elnora to Philip.\n\nThey came and looked over Mrs. Comstock's shoulder. Lower drooped the\ngay wings, wider they spread, brighter grew the markings as if laid off\nin geometrical patterns. They could hear Mrs. Comstock's tense breath\nand see her absorbed expression.\n\n“Young people,” she said solemnly, “if your studying science and the\nelements has ever led you to feel that things just happen, kind of\nevolve by chance, as it were, this sight will be good for you. Maybe\nearth and air accumulate, but it takes the wisdom of the Almighty God\nto devise the wing of a moth. If there ever was a miracle, this whole\nprocess is one. Now, as I understand it, this creature is going to keep\non spreading those wings, until they grow to size and harden to strength\nsufficient to bear its body. Then it flies away, mates with its kind,\nlays its eggs on the leaves of a certain tree, and the eggs hatch tiny\ncaterpillars which eat just that kind of leaves, and the worms grow and\ngrow, and take on different forms and colours until at last they are big\ncaterpillars six inches long, with large horns. Then they burrow into\nthe earth, build a water-proof house around themselves from material\nwhich is inside them, and lie through rain and freezing cold for months.\nA year from egg laying they come out like this, and begin the process\nall over again. They don't eat, they don't see distinctly, they live\nbut a few days, and fly only at night; then they drop off easy, but the\nprocess goes on.”\n\nA shivering movement went over the moth. The wings drooped and spread\nwider. Mrs. Comstock sank into soft awed tones.\n\n“There never was a moment in my life,” she said, “when I felt so in the\nPresence, as I do now. I feel as if the Almighty were so real, and so\nnear, that I could reach out and touch Him, as I could this wonderful\nwork of His, if I dared. I feel like saying to Him: 'To the extent of my\nbrain power I realize Your presence, and all it is in me to comprehend\nof Your power. Help me to learn, even this late, the lessons of Your\nwonderful creations. Help me to unshackle and expand my soul to the\nfullest realization of Your wonders. Almighty God, make me bigger, make\nme broader!'”\n\nThe moth climbed to the end of the projection, up it a little way, then\nsuddenly reversed its wings, turned the hidden sides out and dropped\nthem beside its abdomen, like a large fly. The upper side of the wings,\nthus exposed, was far richer colour, more exquisite texture than the\nunder, and they slowly half lifted and drooped again. Mrs. Comstock\nturned her face to Philip.\n\n“Am I an old fool, or do you feel it, too?” she half whispered.\n\n“You are wiser than you ever have been before,” answered he. “I feel it,\nalso.”\n\n“And I,” breathed Elnora.\n\nThe moth spread its wings, shivered them tremulously, opening and\nclosing them rapidly. Philip handed the box to Elnora.\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“I can't take that one,” she said. “Give her freedom.”\n\n“But, Elnora,” protested Mrs. Comstock, “I don't want to let her go.\nShe's mine. She's the first one I ever found this way. Can't you put her\nin a big box, and let her live, without hurting her? I can't bear to let\nher go. I want to learn all about her.”\n\n“Then watch while we gather these on the trees,” said Elnora. “We will\ntake her home until night and then decide what to do. She won't fly for\na long time yet.”\n\nMrs. Comstock settled on the ground, gazing at the moth. Elnora and\nPhilip went to the baited trees, placing several large moths and a\nnumber of smaller ones in the cyanide jar, and searching the bushes\nbeyond where they found several paired specimens of differing families.\nWhen they returned Elnora showed her mother how to hold her hand before\nthe moth so that it would climb upon her fingers. Then they started back\nto the cabin, Elnora and Philip leading the way; Mrs. Comstock followed\nslowly, stepping with great care lest she stumble and injure the moth.\nHer face wore a look of comprehension, in her eyes was an exalted light.\nOn she came to the blue-bordered pool lying beside her path.\n\nA turtle scrambled from a log and splashed into the water, while a\nred-wing shouted, “O-ka-lee!” to her. Mrs. Comstock paused and looked\nintently at the slime-covered quagmire, framed in a flower riot and\nhomed over by sweet-voiced birds. Then she gazed at the thing of\nincomparable beauty clinging to her fingers and said softly: “If you\nhad known about wonders like these in the days of your youth, Robert\nComstock, could you ever have done what you did?”\n\nElnora missed her mother, and turning to look for her, saw her standing\nbeside the pool. Would the old fascination return? A panic of fear\nseized the girl. She went back swiftly.\n\n“Are you afraid she is going?” Elnora asked. “If you are, cup your other\nhand over her for shelter. Carrying her through this air and in the hot\nsunshine will dry her wings and make them ready for flight very quickly.\nYou can't trust her in such air and light as you can in the cool dark\nwoods.”\n\nWhile she talked she took hold of her mother's sleeve, anxiously smiling\na pitiful little smile that Mrs. Comstock understood. Philip set his\nload at the back door, returning to hold open the garden gate for Elnora\nand Mrs. Comstock. He reached it in time to see them standing together\nbeside the pool. The mother bent swiftly and kissed the girl on the\nlips. Philip turned and was busily hunting moths on the raspberry\nbushes when they reached the gate. And so excellent are the rewards of\nattending your own business, that he found a Promethea on a lilac in a\ncorner; a moth of such rare wine-coloured, velvety shades that it almost\nsent Mrs. Comstock to her knees again. But this one was fully developed,\nable to fly, and had to be taken into the cabin hurriedly. Mrs. Comstock\nstood in the middle of the room holding up her Regalis.\n\n“Now what must I do?” she asked.\n\nElnora glanced at Philip Ammon. Their eyes met and both of them smiled;\nhe with amusement at the tall, spare figure, with dark eyes and white\ncrown, asking the childish question so confidingly; and Elnora with\npride. She was beginning to appreciate the character of her mother.\n\n“How would you like to sit and see her finish development? I'll get\ndinner,” proposed the girl.\n\nAfter they had dined, Philip and Elnora carried the dishes to the\nkitchen, brought out boxes, sheets of cork, pins, ink, paper slips and\neverything necessary for mounting and classifying the moths they had\ntaken. When the housework was finished Mrs. Comstock with her ruffle\nsat near, watching and listening. She remembered all they said that she\nunderstood, and when uncertain she asked questions. Occasionally she\nlaid down her work to straighten some flower which needed attention\nor to search the garden for a bug for the grosbeak. In one of these\nabsences Elnora said to Philip: “These replace quite a number of the\nmoths I lost for the man of India. With a week of such luck, I could\nalmost begin to talk college again.”\n\n“There is no reason why you should not have the week and the luck,” said\nhe. “I have taken moths until the middle of August, though I suspect one\nis more likely to find late ones in the north where it is colder\nthan here. The next week is hay-time, but we can count on a few\ndouble-brooders and strays, and by working the exchange method for all\nit is worth, I think we can complete the collection again.”\n\n“You almost make me hope,” said Elnora, “but I must not allow myself. I\ndon't truly think I can replace all I lost, not even with your help. If\nI could, I scarcely see my way clear to leave mother this winter. I have\nfound her so recently, and she is so precious, I can't risk losing her\nagain. I am going to take the nature position in the Onabasha schools,\nand I shall be most happy doing the work. Only, these are a temptation.”\n\n“I wish you might go to college this fall with the other girls,” said\nPhilip. “I feel that if you don't you never will. Isn't there some way?”\n\n“I can't see it if there is, and I really don't want to leave mother.”\n\n“Well, mother is mighty glad to hear it,” said Mrs. Comstock, entering\nthe arbour.\n\nPhilip noticed that her face was pale, her lips quivering, her voice\ncold.\n\n“I was telling your daughter that she should go to college this winter,”\n he explained, “but she says she doesn't want to leave you.”\n\n“If she wants to go, I wish she could,” said Mrs. Comstock, a look of\nrelief spreading over her face.\n\n“Oh, all girls want to go to college,” said Philip. “It's the only\nproper place to learn bridge and embroidery; not to mention midnight\nlunches of mixed pickles and fruit cake, and all the delights of the\nsororities.”\n\n“I have thought for years of going to college,” said Elnora, “but I\nnever thought of any of those things.”\n\n“That is because your education in fudge and bridge has been sadly\nneglected,” said Philip. “You should hear my sister Polly! This was her\nfinal year! Lunches and sororities were all I heard her mention, until\nTom Levering came on deck; now he is the leading subject. I can't see\nfrom her daily conversation that she knows half as much really worth\nknowing as you do, but she's ahead of you miles on fun.”\n\n“Oh, we had some good times in the high school,” said Elnora. “Life\nhasn't been all work and study. Is Edith Carr a college girl?”\n\n“No. She is the very selectest kind of a private boarding-school girl.”\n\n“Who is she?” asked Mrs. Comstock.\n\nPhilip opened his lips.\n\n“She is a girl in Chicago, that Mr. Ammon knows very well,” said Elnora.\n“She is beautiful and rich, and a friend of his sister's. Or, didn't you\nsay that?”\n\n“I don't remember, but she is,” said Philip. “This moth needs an alcohol\nbath to remove the dope.”\n\n“Won't the down come, too?” asked Elnora anxiously.\n\n“No. You watch and you will see it come out, as Polly would say, 'a\nperfectly good' moth.”\n\n“Is your sister younger than you?” inquired Elnora.\n\n“Yes,” said Philip, “but she is three years older than you. She is the\ndearest sister in all the world. I'd love to see her now.”\n\n“Why don't you send for her,” suggested Elnora. “Perhaps she'd like to\nhelp us catch moths.”\n\n“Yes, I think Polly in a Virot hat, Picot embroidered frock and\nthree-inch heels would take more moths than any one who ever tried the\nLimberlost,” laughed Philip.\n\n“Well, you find many of them, and you are her brother.”\n\n“Yes, but that is different. Father was reared in Onabasha, and he loved\nthe country. He trained me his way and mother took charge of Polly. I\ndon't quite understand it. Mother is a great home body herself, but she\ndid succeed in making Polly strictly ornamental.”\n\n“Does Tom Levering need a 'strictly ornamental' girl?”\n\n“You are too matter of fact! Too 'strictly' material. He needs a darling\ngirl who will love him plenty, and Polly is that.”\n\n“Well, then, does the Limberlost need a 'strictly ornamental' girl?”\n\n“No!” cried Philip. “You are ornament enough for the Limberlost. I have\nchanged my mind. I don't want Polly here. She would not enjoy catching\nmoths, or anything we do.”\n\n“She might,” persisted Elnora. “You are her brother, and surely you care\nfor these things.”\n\n“The argument does not hold,” said Philip. “Polly and I do not like the\nsame things when we are at home, but we are very fond of each other. The\nmember of my family who would go crazy about this is my father. I wish\nhe could come, if only for a week. I'd send for him, but he is tied up\nin preparing some papers for a great corporation case this summer. He\nlikes the country. It was his vote that brought me here.”\n\nPhilip leaned back against the arbour, watching the grosbeak as it\nhunted food between a tomato vine and a day lily. Elnora set him to\nmaking labels, and when he finished them he asked permission to write\na letter. He took no pains to conceal his page, and from where she sat\nopposite him, Elnora could not look his way without reading: “My dearest\nEdith.” He wrote busily for a time and then sat staring across the\ngarden.\n\n“Have you run out of material so quickly?” asked Elnora.\n\n“That's about it,” said Philip. “I have said that I am getting well as\nrapidly as possible, that the air is fine, the folks at Uncle Doc's all\nwell, and entirely too good to me; that I am spending most of my time\nin the country helping catch moths for a collection, which is splendid\nexercise; now I can't think of another thing that will be interesting.”\n\nThere was a burst of exquisite notes in the maple.\n\n“Put in the grosbeak,” suggested Elnora. “Tell her you are so friendly\nwith him you feed him potato bugs.”\n\nPhilip lowered the pen to the sheet, bent forward, then hesitated.\n\n“Blest if I do!” he cried. “She'd think a grosbeak was a depraved person\nwith a large nose. She'd never dream that it was a black-robed lover,\nwith a breast of snow and a crimson heart. She doesn't care for hungry\nbabies and potato bugs. I shall write that to father. He will find it\ndelightful.”\n\nElnora deftly picked up a moth, pinned it and placed its wings. She\nstraightened the antennae, drew each leg into position and set it in\nperfectly lifelike manner. As she lifted her work to see if she had it\nright, she glanced at Philip. He was still frowning and hesitating over\nthe paper.\n\n“I dare you to let me dictate a couple of paragraphs.”\n\n“Done!” cried Philip. “Go slowly enough that I can write it.”\n\nElnora laughed gleefully.\n\n“I am writing this,” she began, “in an old grape arbour in the country,\nnear a log cabin where I had my dinner. From where I sit I can see\ndirectly into the home of the next-door neighbour on the west. His name\nis R. B. Grosbeak. From all I have seen of him, he is a gentleman of\nthe old school; the oldest school there is, no doubt. He always wears a\nblack suit and cap and a white vest, decorated with one large red heart,\nwhich I think must be the emblem of some ancient order. I have been here\na number of times, and I never have seen him wear anything else, or his\nwife appear in other than a brown dress with touches of white.\n\n“It has appealed to me at times that she was a shade neglectful of her\nhome duties, but he does not seem to feel that way. He cheerfully stays\nin the sitting-room, while she is away having a good time, and sings\nwhile he cares for the four small children. I must tell you about his\nmusic. I am sure he never saw inside a conservatory. I think he merely\npicked up what he knows by ear and without vocal training, but there\nis a tenderness in his tones, a depth of pure melody, that I never have\nheard surpassed. It may be that I think more of his music than that\nof some other good vocalists hereabout, because I see more of him and\nappreciate his devotion to his home life.\n\n“I just had an encounter with him at the west fence, and induced him to\ncarry a small gift to his children. When I see the perfect harmony in\nwhich he lives, and the depth of content he and the brown lady find in\nlife, I am almost persuaded to-- Now this is going to be poetry,” said\nElnora. “Move your pen over here and begin with a quote and a cap.”\n\nPhilip's face had been an interesting study while he wrote her\nsentences. Now he gravely set the pen where she indicated, and Elnora\ndictated--\n\n     “Buy a nice little home in the country,\n     And settle down there for life.”\n\n“That's the truth!” cried Philip. “It's as big a temptation as I ever\nhad. Go on!”\n\n“That's all,” said Elnora. “You can finish. The moths are done. I am\ngoing hunting for whatever I can find for the grades.”\n\n“Wait a minute,” begged Philip. “I am going, too.”\n\n“No. You stay with mother and finish your letter.”\n\n“It is done. I couldn't add anything to that.”\n\n“Very well! Sign your name and come on. But I forgot to tell you all\nthe bargain. Maybe you won't send the letter when you hear that. The\nremainder is that you show me the reply to my part of it.”\n\n“Oh, that's easy! I wouldn't have the slightest objection to showing you\nthe whole letter.”\n\nHe signed his name, folded the sheets and slipped them into his pocket.\n\n“Where are we going and what do we take?”\n\n“Will you go, mother?” asked Elnora.\n\n“I have a little work that should be done,” said Mrs. Comstock. “Could\nyou spare me? Where do you want to go?”\n\n“We will go down to Aunt Margaret's and see her a few minutes and get\nBilly. We will be back in time for supper.”\n\nMrs. Comstock smiled as she watched them down the road. What a\nsplendid-looking pair of young creatures they were! How finely\nproportioned, how full of vitality! Then her face grew troubled as she\nsaw them in earnest conversation. Just as she was wishing she had not\ntrusted her precious girl with so much of a stranger, she saw Elnora\nstoop to lift a branch and peer under. The mother grew content. Elnora\nwas thinking only of her work. She was to be trusted utterly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nWHEREIN THE LIMBERLOST SINGS FOR PHILIP, AND THE TALKING TREES TELL\nGREAT SECRETS\n\n\nA few days later Philip handed Elnora a sheet of paper and she read: “In\nyour condition I should think the moth hunting and life at that cabin\nwould be very good for you, but for any sake keep away from that\nGrosbeak person, and don't come home with your head full of granger\nideas. No doubt he has a remarkable voice, but I can't bear untrained\nsingers, and don't you get the idea that a June song is perennial. You\nare not hearing the music he will make when the four babies have the\nscarlet fever and the measles, and the gadding wife leaves him at home\nto care for them then. Poor soul, I pity her! How she exists where\nrampant cows bellow at you, frogs croak, mosquitoes consume you, the\nbutter goes to oil in summer and bricks in winter, while the pump\nfreezes every day, and there is no earthly amusement, and no society!\nPoor things! Can't you influence him to move? No wonder she gads when\nshe has a chance! I should die. If you are thinking of settling in the\ncountry, think also of a woman who is satisfied with white and brown to\naccompany you! Brown! Of all deadly colours! I should go mad in brown.”\n\nElnora laughed while she read. Her face was dimpling, as she returned\nthe sheet. “Who's ahead?” she asked.\n\n“Who do you think?” he parried.\n\n“She is,” said Elnora. “Are you going to tell her in your next that R.\nB. Grosbeak is a bird, and that he probably will spend the winter in a\nwild plum thicket in Tennessee?”\n\n“No,” said Philip. “I shall tell her that I understand her ideas of\nlife perfectly, and, of course, I never shall ask her to deal with oily\nbutter and frozen pumps--”\n\n“--and measley babies,” interpolated Elnora.\n\n“Exactly!” said Philip. “At the same time I find so much to\ncounterbalance those things, that I should not object to bearing them\nmyself, in view of the recompense. Where do we go and what do we do\nto-day?”\n\n“We will have to hunt beside the roads and around the edge of the\nLimberlost to-day,” said Elnora. “Mother is making strawberry preserves,\nand she can't come until she finishes. Suppose we go down to the swamp\nand I'll show you what is left of the flower-room that Terence O'More,\nthe big lumber man of Great Rapids, made when he was a homeless boy\nhere. Of course, you have heard the story?”\n\n“Yes, and I've met the O'Mores who are frequently in Chicago society.\nThey have friends there. I think them one ideal couple.”\n\n“That sounds as if they might be the only one,” said Elnora, “and,\nindeed, they are not. I know dozens. Aunt Margaret and Uncle Wesley are\nanother, the Brownlees another, and my mathematics professor and his\nwife. The world is full of happy people, but no one ever hears of them.\nYou must fight and make a scandal to get into the papers. No one knows\nabout all the happy people. I am happy myself, and look how perfectly\ninconspicuous I am.”\n\n“You only need go where you will be seen,” began Philip, when he\nremembered and finished. “What do we take to-day?”\n\n“Ourselves,” said Elnora. “I have a vagabond streak in my blood and it's\nin evidence. I am going to show you where real flowers grow, real birds\nsing, and if I feel quite right about it, perhaps I shall raise a note\nor two myself.”\n\n“Oh, do you sing?” asked Philip politely.\n\n“At times,” answered Elnora. “'As do the birds; because I must,' but\ndon't be scared. The mood does not possess me often. Perhaps I shan't\nraise a note.”\n\nThey went down the road to the swamp, climbed the snake fence, followed\nthe path to the old trail and then turned south upon it. Elnora\nindicated to Philip the trail with remnants of sagging barbed wire.\n\n“It was ten years ago,” she said. “I was a little school girl, but I\nwandered widely even then, and no one cared. I saw him often. He had\nbeen in a city institution all his life, when he took the job of keeping\ntimber thieves out of this swamp, before many trees had been cut. It was\na strong man's work, and he was a frail boy, but he grew hardier as\nhe lived out of doors. This trail we are on is the path his feet first\nwore, in those days when he was insane with fear and eaten up with\nloneliness, but he stuck to his work and won out. I used to come down\nto the road and creep among the bushes as far as I dared, to watch him\npass. He walked mostly, at times he rode a wheel.\n\n“Some days his face was dreadfully sad, others it was so determined a\nlittle child could see the force in it, and once he was radiant. That\nday the Swamp Angel was with him. I can't tell you what she was like. I\nnever saw any one who resembled her. He stopped close here to show her a\nbird's nest. Then they went on to a sort of flower-room he had made, and\nhe sang for her. By the time he left, I had gotten bold enough to come\nout on the trail, and I met the big Scotchman Freckles lived with. He\nsaw me catching moths and butterflies, so he took me to the flower-room\nand gave me everything there. I don't dare come alone often, so I can't\nkeep it up as he did, but you can see something of how it was.”\n\nElnora led the way and Philip followed. The outlines of the room were\nnot distinct, because many of the trees were gone, but Elnora showed how\nit had been as nearly as she could.\n\n“The swamp is almost ruined now,” she said. “The maples, walnuts, and\ncherries are all gone. The talking trees are the only things left worth\nwhile.”\n\n“The 'talking trees!' I don't understand,” commented Philip.\n\n“No wonder!” laughed Elnora. “They are my discovery. You know all trees\nwhisper and talk during the summer, but there are two that have so much\nto say they keep on the whole winter, when the others are silent. The\nbeeches and oaks so love to talk, they cling to their dead, dry leaves.\nIn the winter the winds are stiffest and blow most, so these trees\nwhisper, chatter, sob, laugh, and at times roar until the sound is\ndeafening. They never cease until new leaves come out in the spring to\npush off the old ones. I love to stand beneath them with my ear to the\ntrunks, interpreting what they say to fit my moods. The beeches branch\nlow, and their leaves are small so they only know common earthly things;\nbut the oaks run straight above almost all other trees before they\nbranch, their arms are mighty, their leaves large. They meet the winds\nthat travel around the globe, and from them learn the big things.”\n\nPhilip studied the girls face. “What do the beeches tell you, Elnora?”\n he asked gently.\n\n“To be patient, to be unselfish, to do unto others as I would have them\ndo to me.”\n\n“And the oaks?”\n\n“They say 'be true,' 'live a clean life,' 'send your soul up here and\nthe winds of the world will teach it what honour achieves.'”\n\n“Wonderful secrets, those!” marvelled Philip. “Are they telling them\nnow? Could I hear?”\n\n“No. They are only gossiping now. This is play-time. They tell the big\nsecrets to a white world, when the music inspires them.”\n\n“The music?”\n\n“All other trees are harps in the winter. Their trunks are the frames,\ntheir branches the strings, the winds the musicians. When the air is\ncold and clear, the world very white, and the harp music swelling, then\nthe talking trees tell the strengthening, uplifting things.”\n\n“You wonderful girl!” cried Philip. “What a woman you will be!”\n\n“If I am a woman at all worth while, it will be because I have had such\nwonderful opportunities,” said Elnora. “Not every girl is driven to\nthe forest to learn what God has to say there. Here are the remains\nof Freckles's room. The time the Angel came here he sang to her, and I\nlistened. I never heard music like that. No wonder she loved him. Every\none who knew him did, and they do yet. Try that log, it makes a fairly\ngood seat. This old store box was his treasure house, just as it's now\nmine. I will show you my dearest possession. I do not dare take it home\nbecause mother can't overcome her dislike for it. It was my father's,\nand in some ways I am like him. This is the strongest.”\n\nElnora lifted the violin and began to play. She wore a school dress of\ngreen gingham, with the sleeves rolled to the elbows. She seemed a part\nof the setting all around her. Her head shone like a small dark sun, and\nher face never had seemed so rose-flushed and fair. From the instant she\ndrew the bow, her lips parted and her eyes turned toward something far\naway in the swamp, and never did she give more of that impression of\nfeeling for her notes and repeating something audible only to her.\nPhilip was too close to get the best effect. He arose and stepped back\nseveral yards, leaning against a large tree, looking and listening\nintently.\n\nAs he changed positions he saw that Mrs. Comstock had followed them,\nand was standing on the trail, where she could not have helped hearing\neverything Elnora had said.\n\nSo to Philip before her and the mother watching on the trail, Elnora\nplayed the Song of the Limberlost. It seemed as if the swamp hushed all\nits other voices and spoke only through her dancing bow. The mother out\non the trail had heard it all, once before from the girl, many times\nfrom her father. To the man it was a revelation. He stood so stunned he\nforgot Mrs. Comstock. He tried to realize what a city audience would\nsay to that music, from such a player, with a similar background, and he\ncould not imagine.\n\nHe was wondering what he dared say, how much he might express, when\nthe last note fell and the girl laid the violin in the case, closed the\ndoor, locked it and hid the key in the rotting wood at the end of a log.\nThen she came to him. Philip stood looking at her curiously.\n\n“I wonder,” he said, “what people would say to that?”\n\n“I played that in public once,” said Elnora. “I think they liked it,\nfairly well. I had a note yesterday offering me the leadership of the\nhigh school orchestra in Onabasha. I can take it as well as not. None of\nmy talks to the grades come the first thing in the morning. I can play\na few minutes in the orchestra and reach the rooms in plenty of time.\nIt will be more work that I love, and like finding the money. I would\ngladly play for nothing, merely to be able to express myself.”\n\n“With some people it makes a regular battlefield of the human\nheart--this struggle for self-expression,” said Philip. “You are going\nto do beautiful work in the world, and do it well. When I realize that\nyour violin belonged to your father, that he played it before you were\nborn, and it no doubt affected your mother strongly, and then couple\nwith that the years you have roamed these fields and swamps finding in\nnature all you had to lavish your heart upon, I can see how you evolved.\nI understand what you mean by self-expression. I know something of what\nyou have to express. The world never so wanted your message as it does\nnow. It is hungry for the things you know. I can see easily how your\nposition came to you. What you have to give is taught in no college, and\nI am not sure but you would spoil yourself if you tried to run your mind\nthrough a set groove with hundreds of others. I never thought I should\nsay such a thing to any one, but I do say to you, and I honestly believe\nit; give up the college idea. Your mind does not need that sort of\ndevelopment. Stick close to your work in the woods. You are becoming so\ninfinitely greater on it, than the best college girl I ever knew, that\nthere is no comparison. When you have money to spend, take that violin\nand go to one of the world's great masters and let the Limberlost sing\nto him; if he thinks he can improve it, very well. I have my doubts.”\n\n“Do you really mean that you would give up all idea of going to college,\nin my place?”\n\n“I really mean it,” said Philip. “If I now held the money in my hands to\nsend you, and could give it to you in some way you would accept I\nwould not. I do not know why it is the fate of the world always to want\nsomething different from what life gives them. If you only could realize\nit, my girl, you are in college, and have been always. You are in the\nschool of experience, and it has taught you to think, and given you\na heart. God knows I envy the man who wins it! You have been in the\ncollege of the Limberlost all your life, and I never met a graduate from\nany other institution who could begin to compare with you in sanity,\nclarity, and interesting knowledge. I wouldn't even advise you to read\ntoo many books on your lines. You acquire your material first hand, and\nyou know that you are right. What you should do is to begin early to\npractise self-expression. Don't wait too long to tell us about the woods\nas you know them.”\n\n“Follow the course of the Bird Woman, you mean?” asked Elnora.\n\n“In your own way; with your own light. She won't live forever. You are\nyounger, and you will be ready to begin where she ends. The swamp has\ngiven you all you need so far; now you give it to the world in payment.\nCollege be confounded! Go to work and show people what there is in you!”\n\nNot until then did he remember Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“Should we go out to the trail and see if your mother is coming?” he\nasked.\n\n“Here she is now,” said Elnora. “Gracious, it's a mercy I got that\nviolin put away in time! I didn't expect her so soon,” whispered\nthe girl as she turned and went toward her mother. Mrs. Comstock's\nexpression was peculiar as she looked at Elnora.\n\n“I forgot that you were making sun-preserves and they didn't require\nmuch cooking,” she said. “We should have waited for you.”\n\n“Not at all!” answered Mrs. Comstock. “Have you found anything yet?”\n\n“Nothing that I can show you,” said Elnora. “I am almost sure I have\nfound an idea that will revolutionize the whole course of my work,\nthought, and ambitions.”\n\n“'Ambitions!' My, what a hefty word!” laughed Mrs. Comstock. “Now who\nwould suspect a little red-haired country girl of harbouring such a\ndeadly germ in her body? Can you tell mother about it?”\n\n“Not if you talk to me that way, I can't,” said Elnora.\n\n“Well, I guess we better let ambition lie. I've always heard it was\nsafest asleep. If you ever get a bona fide attack, it will be time to\nattend it. Let's hunt specimens. It is June. Philip and I are in the\ngrades. You have an hour to put an idea into our heads that will stick\nfor a lifetime, and grow for good. That's the way I look at your job.\nNow, what are you going to give us? We don't want any old silly stuff\nthat has been hashed over and over, we want a big new idea to plant\nin our hearts. Come on, Miss Teacher, what is the boiled-down,\ndouble-distilled essence of June? Give it to us strong. We are large\nenough to furnish it developing ground. Hurry up! Time is short and we\nare waiting. What is the miracle of June? What one thing epitomizes the\nwhole month, and makes it just a little different from any other?”\n\n“The birth of these big night moths,” said Elnora promptly.\n\nPhilip clapped his hands. The tears started to Mrs. Comstock's eyes. She\ntook Elnora in her arms, and kissed her forehead.\n\n“You'll do!” she said. “June is June, not because it has bloom, bird,\nfruit, or flower, exclusive to it alone.\n\n“It's half May and half July in all of them. But to me, it's just June,\nwhen it comes to these great, velvet-winged night moths which sweep its\nmoonlit skies, consummating their scheme of creation, and dropping like\na bloomed-out flower. Give them moths for June. Then make that the basis\nof your year's work. Find the distinctive feature of each month, the\none thing which marks it a time apart, and hit them squarely between the\neyes with it. Even the babies of the lowest grades can comprehend moths\nwhen they see a few emerge, and learn their history, as it can be lived\nbefore them. You should show your specimens in pairs, then their eggs,\nthe growing caterpillars, and then the cocoons. You want to dig out the\nred heart of every month in the year, and hold it pulsing before them.\n\n“I can't name all of them off-hand, but I think of one more right now.\nFebruary belongs to our winter birds. It is then the great horned owl of\nthe swamp courts his mate, the big hawks pair, and even the crows begin\nto take notice. These are truly our birds. Like the poor we have them\nalways with us. You should hear the musicians of this swamp in February,\nPhilip, on a mellow night. Oh, but they are in earnest! For twenty-one\nyears I've listened by night to the great owls, all the smaller sizes,\nthe foxes, coons, and every resident left in these woods, and by day to\nthe hawks, yellow-hammers, sap-suckers, titmice, crows, and other winter\nbirds. Only just now it's come to me that the distinctive feature of\nFebruary is not linen bleaching, nor sugar making; it's the love month\nof our very own birds. Give them hawks and owls for February, Elnora.”\n\nWith flashing eyes the girl looked at Philip. “How's that?” she said.\n“Don't you think I will succeed, with such help? You should hear the\nconcert she is talking about! It is simply indescribable when the ground\nis covered with snow, and the moonlight white.”\n\n“It's about the best music we have,” said Mrs. Comstock. “I wonder if\nyou couldn't copy that and make a strong, original piece out of it for\nyour violin, Elnora?”\n\nThere was one tense breath, then---- “I could try,” said Elnora simply.\n\nPhilip rushed to the rescue. “We must go to work,” he said, and began\nexamining a walnut branch for Luna moth eggs. Elnora joined him while\nMrs. Comstock drew her embroidery from her pocket and sat on a log. She\nsaid she was tired, they could come for her when they were ready to go.\nShe could hear their voices around her until she called them at supper\ntime. When they came to her she stood waiting on the trail, the sewing\nin one hand, the violin in the other. Elnora became very white, but\nfollowed the trail without a word. Philip, unable to see a woman carry\na heavier load than he, reached for the instrument. Mrs. Comstock shook\nher head. She carried the violin home, took it into her room and closed\nthe door. Elnora turned to Philip.\n\n“If she destroys that, I shall die!” cried the girl.\n\n“She won't!” said Philip. “You misunderstand her. She wouldn't have said\nwhat she did about the owls, if she had meant to. She is your mother.\nNo one loves you as she does. Trust her! Myself--I think she's simply\ngreat!”\n\nMrs. Comstock returned with serene face, and all of them helped with\nthe supper. When it was over Philip and Elnora sorted and classified the\nafternoon's specimens, and made a trip to the woods to paint and light\nseveral trees for moths. When they came back Mrs. Comstock sat in the\narbour, and they joined her. The moonlight was so intense, print could\nhave been read by it. The damp night air held odours near to earth,\nmaking flower and tree perfume strong. A thousand insects were\nserenading, and in the maple the grosbeak occasionally said a reassuring\nword to his wife, while she answered that all was well. A whip-poor-will\nwailed in the swamp and beside the blue-bordered pool a chat complained\ndisconsolately. Mrs. Comstock went into the cabin, but she returned\nimmediately, laying the violin and bow across Elnora's lap. “I wish you\nwould give us a little music,” she said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nWHEREIN MRS. COMSTOCK DANCES IN THE MOONLIGHT, AND ELNORA MAKES A\nCONFESSION\n\n\nBilly was swinging in the hammock, at peace with himself and all the\nworld, when he thought he heard something. He sat bolt upright, his eyes\nstaring. Once he opened his lips, then thought again and closed them.\nThe sound persisted. Billy vaulted the fence, and ran down the road with\nhis queer sidewise hop. When he neared the Comstock cabin, he left the\nwarm dust of the highway and stepped softly at slower pace over the\nrank grasses of the roadside. He had heard aright. The violin was in the\ngrape arbour, singing a perfect jumble of everything, poured out in an\nexultant tumult. The strings were voicing the joy of a happy girl heart.\n\nBilly climbed the fence enclosing the west woods and crept toward the\narbour. He was not a spy and not a sneak. He merely wanted to satisfy\nhis child-heart as to whether Mrs. Comstock was at home, and Elnora\nat last playing her loved violin with her mother's consent. One peep\nsufficed. Mrs. Comstock sat in the moonlight, her head leaning against\nthe arbour; on her face was a look of perfect peace and contentment. As\nhe stared at her the bow hesitated a second and Mrs. Comstock spoke:\n\n“That's all very melodious and sweet,” she said, “but I do wish you\ncould play Money Musk and some of the tunes I danced as a girl.”\n\nElnora had been carefully avoiding every note that might be reminiscent\nof her father. At the words she laughed softly and began “Turkey in the\nStraw.” An instant later Mrs. Comstock was dancing in the moon light.\nAmmon sprang to her side, caught her in his arms, while to Elnora's\nlaughter and the violin's impetus they danced until they dropped panting\non the arbour bench.\n\nBilly scarcely knew when he reached the road. His light feet barely\ntouched the soft way, so swiftly he flew. He vaulted the fence and burst\ninto the house.\n\n“Aunt Margaret! Uncle Wesley!” he screamed. “Listen! Listen! She's\nplaying it! Elnora's playing her violin at home! And Aunt Kate is\ndancing like anything before the arbour! I saw her in the moonlight! I\nran down! Oh, Aunt Margaret!”\n\nBilly fled sobbing to Margaret's breast.\n\n“Why Billy!” she chided. “Don't cry, you little dunce! That's what we've\nall prayed for these many years; but you must be mistaken about Kate. I\ncan't believe it.”\n\nBilly lifted his head. “Well, you just have to!” he said. “When I say\nI saw anything, Uncle Wesley knows I did. The city man was dancing with\nher. They danced together and Elnora laughed. But it didn't look funny\nto me; I was scared.”\n\n“Who was it said 'wonders never cease,'” asked Wesley. “You mark my\nword, once you get Kate Comstock started, you can't stop her. There's\na wagon load of penned-up force in her. Dancing in the moonlight! Well,\nI'll be hanged!”\n\nBilly was at his side instantly. “Whoever does it will have to hang me,\ntoo,” he cried.\n\nSinton threw his arm around Billy and drew him closely. “Tell us all\nabout it, son,” he said. Billy told. “And when Elnora just stopped\na breath, 'Can't you play some of the old things I knew when I was a\ngirl?' said her ma. Then Elnora began to do a thing that made you\nwant to whirl round and round, and quicker 'an scat there was her ma\na-whirling. The city man, he ups and grabs her and whirls, too, and back\nin the woods I was going just like they did. Elnora begins to laugh, and\nI ran to tell you, cos I knew you'd like to know. Now, all the world is\nright, ain't it?” ended Billy in supreme satisfaction.\n\n“You just bet it is!” said Wesley.\n\nBilly looked steadily at Margaret. “Is it, Aunt Margaret?”\n\nMargaret Sinton smiled at him bravely.\n\nAn hour later when Billy was ready to climb the stairs to his room, he\nwent to Margaret to say good night. He leaned against her an instant,\nthen brought his lips to her ear. “Wish I could get your little girls\nback for you!” he whispered and dashed toward the stairs.\n\nDown at the Comstock cabin the violin played on until Elnora was so\ntired she scarcely could lift the bow. Then Philip went home. The women\nwalked to the gate with him, and stood watching him from sight.\n\n“That's what I call one decent young man!” said Mrs. Comstock. “To see\nhim fit in with us, you'd think he'd been brought up in a cabin; but\nit's likely he's always had the very cream o' the pot.”\n\n“Yes, I think so,” laughed Elnora, “but it hasn't hurt him. I've\nnever seen anything I could criticise. He's teaching me so much,\nunconsciously. You know he graduated from Harvard, and has several\ndegrees in law. He's coming in the morning, and we are going to put in a\nbig day on Catocalae.”\n\n“Which is----?”\n\n“Those gray moths with wings that fold back like big flies, and they\nappear as if they had been carved from old wood. Then, when they fly,\nthe lower wings flash out and they are red and black, or gold and black,\nor pink and black, or dozens of bright, beautiful colours combined with\nblack. No one ever has classified all of them and written their complete\nhistory, unless the Bird Woman is doing it now. She wants everything she\ncan get about them.”\n\n“I remember,” said Mrs. Comstock. “They are mighty pretty things. I've\nstarted up slews of them from the vines covering the logs, all my life.\nI must be cautious and catch them after this, but they seem powerful\nspry. I might get hold of something rare.” She thought intently and\nadded, “And wouldn't know it if I did. It would just be my luck. I've\nhad the rarest thing on earth in reach this many a day and only had the\nwit to cinch it just as it was going. I'll bet I don't let anything else\nescape me.”\n\nNext morning Philip came early, and he and Elnora went at once to the\nfields and woods. Mrs. Comstock had come to believe so implicitly in him\nthat she now stayed at home to complete the work before she joined them,\nand when she did she often sat sewing, leaving them wandering hours at\na time. It was noon before she finished, and then she packed a basket\nof lunch. She found Elnora and Philip near the violet patch, which was\nstill in its prime. They all lunched together in the shade of a wild\ncrab thicket, with flowers spread at their feet, and the gold orioles\nstreaking the air with flashes of light and trailing ecstasy behind\nthem, while the red-wings, as always, asked the most impertinent\nquestions. Then Mrs. Comstock carried the basket back to the cabin,\nand Philip and Elnora sat on a log, resting a few minutes. They had\nunexpected luck, and both were eager to continue the search.\n\n“Do you remember your promise about these violets?” asked he. “To-morrow\nis Edith's birthday, and if I'd put them special delivery on the morning\ntrain, she'd get them in the late afternoon. They ought to keep that\nlong. She leaves for the North next day.”\n\n“Of course, you may have them,” said Elnora. “We will quit long enough\nbefore supper to gather a large bunch. They can be packed so they will\ncarry all right. They should be perfectly fresh, especially if we gather\nthem this evening and let them drink all night.”\n\nThen they went back to hunt Catocalae. It was a long and a happy search.\nIt led them into new, unexplored nooks of the woods, past a red-poll\nnest, and where goldfinches prospected for thistledown for the cradles\nthey would line a little later. It led them into real forest, where\ndeep, dark pools lay, where the hermit thrush and the wood robin\nextracted the essence from all other bird melody, and poured it out in\ntheir pure bell-tone notes. It seemed as if every old gray tree-trunk,\nslab of loose bark, and prostrate log yielded the flashing gray\ntreasures; while of all others they seemed to take alarm most easily,\nand be most difficult to capture.\n\nPhilip came to Elnora at dusk, daintily holding one by the body, its\ndark wings showing and its long slender legs trying to clasp his fingers\nand creep from his hold.\n\n“Oh for mercy's sake!” cried Elnora, staring at him.\n\n“I half believe it!” exulted Ammon.\n\n“Did you ever see one?”\n\n“Only in collections, and very seldom there.”\n\nElnora studied the black wings intently. “I surely believe that's\nSappho,” she marvelled. “The Bird Woman will be overjoyed.”\n\n“We must get the cyanide jar quickly,” said Philip.\n\n“I wouldn't lose her for anything. Such a chase as she led me!”\n\nElnora brought the jar and began gathering up paraphernalia.\n\n“When you make a find like that,” she said, “it's the right time to quit\nand feel glorious all the rest of that day. I tell you I'm proud! We\nwill go now. We have barely time to carry out our plans before supper.\nWon't mother be pleased to see that we have a rare one?”\n\n“I'd like to see any one more pleased than I am!” said Philip Ammon. “I\nfeel as if I'd earned my supper to-night. Let's go.”\n\nHe took the greater part of the load and stepped aside for Elnora to\nprecede him. She followed the path, broken by the grazing cattle, toward\nthe cabin and nearest the violet patch she stopped, laid down her net,\nand the things she carried. Philip passed her and hurried straight\ntoward the back gate.\n\n“Aren't you going to----?” began Elnora.\n\n“I'm going to get this moth home in a hurry,” he said. “This cyanide has\nlost its strength, and it's not working well. We need some fresh in the\njar.”\n\nHe had forgotten the violets! Elnora stood looking after him, a curious\nexpression on her face. One second so--then she picked up the net and\nfollowed. At the blue-bordered pool she paused and half turned back,\nthen she closed her lips firmly and went on. It was nine o'clock when\nPhilip said good-bye, and started to town. His gay whistle floated to\nthem from the farthest corner of the Limberlost. Elnora complained of\nbeing tired, so she went to her room and to bed. But sleep would not\ncome. Thought was racing in her brain and the longer she lay the wider\nawake she grew. At last she softly slipped from bed, lighted her lamp\nand began opening boxes. Then she went to work. Two hours later a\nbeautiful birch bark basket, strongly and artistically made, stood on\nher table. She set a tiny alarm clock at three, returned to bed and fell\nasleep instantly with a smile on her lips.\n\nShe was on the floor with the first tinkle of the alarm, and hastily\ndressing, she picked up the basket and a box to fit it, crept down the\nstairs, and out to the violet patch. She was unafraid as it was growing\nlight, and lining the basket with damp mosses she swiftly began picking,\nwith practised hands, the best of the flowers. She scarcely could\ntell which were freshest at times, but day soon came creeping over the\nLimberlost and peeped at her. The robins awoke all their neighbours, and\na babel of bird notes filled the air. The dew was dripping, while the\nfirst strong rays of light fell on a world in which Elnora worshipped.\nWhen the basket was filled to overflowing, she set it in the stout\npasteboard box, packed it solid with mosses, tied it firmly and slipped\nunder the cord a note she had written the previous night.\n\nThen she took a short cut across the woods and walked swiftly to\nOnabasha. It was after six o'clock, but all of the city she wished to\navoid were asleep. She had no trouble in finding a small boy out, and\nshe stood at a distance waiting while he rang Dr. Ammon's bell and\ndelivered the package for Philip to a maid, with the note which was to\nbe given him at once.\n\nOn the way home through the woods passing some baited trees she\ncollected the captive moths. She entered the kitchen with them so\nnaturally that Mrs. Comstock made no comment. After breakfast Elnora\nwent to her room, cleared away all trace of the night's work and was out\nin the arbour mounting moths when Philip came down the road. “I am tired\nsitting,” she said to her mother. “I think I will walk a few rods and\nmeet him.”\n\n“Who's a trump?” he called from afar.\n\n“Not you!” retorted Elnora. “Confess that you forgot!”\n\n“Completely!” said Philip. “But luckily it would not have been fatal. I\nwrote Polly last week to send Edith something appropriate to-day, with\nmy card. But that touch from the woods will be very effective. Thank you\nmore than I can say. Aunt Anna and I unpacked it to see the basket, and\nit was a beauty. She says you are always doing such things.”\n\n“Well, I hope not!” laughed Elnora. “If you'd seen me sneaking out\nbefore dawn, not to awaken mother and coming in with moths to make\nher think I'd been to the trees, you'd know it was a most especial\noccasion.”\n\n“Then Philip understood two things: Elnora's mother did not know of the\nearly morning trip to the city, and the girl had come to meet him to\ntell him so.\n\n“You were a brick to do it!” he whispered as he closed the gate behind\nthem. “I'll never forget you for it. Thank you ever so much.”\n\n“I did not do that for you,” said Elnora tersely. “I did it mostly to\npreserve my own self-respect. I saw you were forgetting. If I did it for\nanything besides that, I did it for her.”\n\n“Just look what I've brought!” said Philip, entering the arbour and\ngreeting Mrs. Comstock. “Borrowed it of the Bird Woman. And it isn't\nhers. A rare edition of Catocalae with coloured plates. I told her the\nbest I could, and she said to try for Sappho here. I suspect the Bird\nWoman will be out presently. She was all excitement.”\n\nThen they bent over the book together and with the mounted moth before\nthem determined her family. The Bird Woman did come later, and carried\nthe moth away, to put into a book and Elnora and Philip were freshly\nfilled with enthusiasm.\n\nSo these days were the beginning of the weeks that followed. Six of them\nflying on Time's wings, each filled to the brim with interest. After\nJune, the moth hunts grew less frequent; the fields and woods were\nsearched for material for Elnora's grade work. The most absorbing\noccupation they found was in carrying out Mrs. Comstock's suggestion\nto learn the vital thing for which each month was distinctive, and make\nthat the key to the nature work. They wrote out a list of the months,\nopposite each the things all of them could suggest which seemed to\npertain to that month alone, and then tried to sift until they found\nsomething typical. Mrs. Comstock was a great help. Her mother had\nbeen Dutch and had brought from Holland numerous quaint sayings and\nsuperstitions easily traceable to Pliny's Natural History; and in Mrs.\nComstock's early years in Ohio she had heard much Indian talk among her\nelders, so she knew the signs of each season, and sometimes they helped.\nAlways her practical thought and sterling common sense were useful. When\nthey were afield until exhausted they came back to the cabin for food,\nto prepare specimens and classify them, and to talk over the day.\nSometimes Philip brought books and read while Elnora and her mother\nworked, and every night Mrs. Comstock asked for the violin. Her perfect\nhunger for music was sufficient evidence of how she had suffered without\nit. So the days crept by, golden, filled with useful work and pure\npleasure.\n\nThe grosbeak had led the family in the maple abroad and a second brood,\nin a wild grape vine clambering over the well, was almost ready for\nflight. The dust lay thick on the country roads, the days grew warmer;\nsummer was just poising to slip into fall, and Philip remained, coming\neach day as if he had belonged there always.\n\nOne warm August afternoon Mrs. Comstock looked up from the ruffle on\nwhich she was engaged to see a blue-coated messenger enter the gate.\n\n“Is Philip Ammon here?” asked the boy.\n\n“He is,” said Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“I have a message for him.”\n\n“He is in the woods back of the cabin. I will ring the bell. Do you know\nif it is important?”\n\n“Urgent,” said the boy; “I rode hard.”\n\nMrs. Comstock stepped to the back door and clanged the dinner bell\nsharply, paused a second, and rang again. In a short time Philip and\nElnora ran down the path.\n\n“Are you ill, mother?” cried Elnora.\n\nMrs. Comstock indicated the boy. “There is an important message for\nPhilip,” she said.\n\nHe muttered an excuse and tore open the telegram. His colour faded\nslightly. “I have to take the first train,” he said. “My father is ill\nand I am needed.”\n\nHe handed the sheet to Elnora. “I have about two hours, as I remember\nthe trains north, but my things are all over Uncle Doc's house, so I\nmust go at once.”\n\n“Certainly,” said Elnora, giving back the message. “Is there anything I\ncan do to help? Mother, bring Philip a glass of buttermilk to start on.\nI will gather what you have here.”\n\n“Never mind. There is nothing of importance. I don't want to be\nhampered. I'll send for it if I miss anything I need.”\n\nPhilip drank the milk, said good-bye to Mrs. Comstock; thanked her for\nall her kindness, and turned to Elnora.\n\n“Will you walk to the edge of the Limberlost with me?” he asked. Elnora\nassented. Mrs. Comstock followed to the gate, urged him to come again\nsoon, and repeated her good-bye. Then she went back to the arbour to\nawait Elnora's return. As she watched down the road she smiled softly.\n\n“I had an idea he would speak to me first,” she thought, “but this may\nchange things some. He hasn't time. Elnora will come back a happy girl,\nand she has good reason. He is a model young man. Her lot will be very\ndifferent from mine.”\n\nShe picked up her embroidery and began setting dainty precise little\nstitches, possible only to certain women.\n\nOn the road Elnora spoke first. “I do hope it is nothing serious,” she\nsaid. “Is he usually strong?”\n\n“Quite strong,” said Philip. “I am not at all alarmed but I am very much\nashamed. I have been well enough for the past month to have gone home\nand helped him with some critical cases that were keeping him at work in\nthis heat. I was enjoying myself so I wouldn't offer to go, and he would\nnot ask me to come, so long as he could help it. I have allowed him to\novertax himself until he is down, and mother and Polly are north at our\ncottage. He's never been sick before, and it's probable I am to blame\nthat he is now.”\n\n“He intended you to stay this long when you came,” urged Elnora.\n\n“Yes, but it's hot in Chicago. I should have remembered him. He is\nalways thinking of me. Possibly he has needed me for days. I am ashamed\nto go to him in splendid condition and admit that I was having such a\nfine time I forgot to come home.”\n\n“You have had a fine time, then?” asked Elnora.\n\nThey had reached the fence. Philip vaulted over to take a short cut\nacross the fields. He turned and looked at her.\n\n“The best, the sweetest, and most wholesome time any man ever had in\nthis world,” he said. “Elnora, if I talked hours I couldn't make you\nunderstand what a girl I think you are. I never in all my life hated\nanything as I hate leaving you. It seems to me that I have not strength\nto do it.”\n\n“If you have learned anything worth while from me,” said Elnora, “that\nshould be it. Just to have strength to go to your duty, and to go\nquickly.”\n\nHe caught the hand she held out to him in both his. “Elnora, these days\nwe have had together, have they been sweet to you?”\n\n“Beautiful days!” said Elnora. “Each like a perfect dream to be thought\nover and over all my life. Oh, they have been the only really happy days\nI've ever known; these days rich with mother's love, and doing useful\nwork with your help. Good-bye! You must hurry!”\n\nPhilip gazed at her. He tried to drop her hand, only clutched it closer.\nSuddenly he drew her toward him. “Elnora,” he whispered, “will you kiss\nme good-bye?”\n\nElnora drew back and stared at him with wide eyes. “I'd strike you\nsooner!” she said. “Have I ever said or done anything in your presence\nthat made you feel free to ask that, Philip Ammon?”\n\n“No!” panted Philip. “No! I think so much of you I wanted to touch your\nlips once before I left you. You know, Elnora----”\n\n“Don't distress yourself,” said Elnora calmly. “I am broad enough to\njudge you sanely. I know what you mean. It would be no harm to you. It\nwould not matter to me, but here we will think of some one else. Edith\nCarr would not want your lips to-morrow if she knew they had touched\nmine to-day. I was wise to say: 'Go quickly!'”\n\nPhilip still clung to her. “Will you write me?” he begged.\n\n“No,” said Elnora. “There is nothing to say, save good-bye. We can do\nthat now.”\n\nHe held on. “Promise that you will write me only one letter,” he urged.\n“I want just one message from you to lock in my desk, and keep always.\nPromise you will write once, Elnora.”\n\nShe looked into his eyes, and smiled serenely. “If the talking trees\ntell me this winter, the secret of how a man may grow perfect, I will\nwrite you what it is, Philip. In all the time I have known you, I never\nhave liked you so little. Good-bye.”\n\nShe drew away her hand and swiftly turned back to the road. Philip\nAmmon, wordless, started toward Onabasha on a run.\n\nElnora crossed the road, climbed the fence and sought the shelter of\ntheir own woods. She chose a diagonal course and followed it until\nshe came to the path leading past the violet patch. She went down this\nhurriedly. Her hands were clenched at her side, her eyes dry and bright,\nher cheeks red-flushed, and her breath coming fast. When she reached the\npatch she turned into it and stood looking around her.\n\nThe mosses were dry, the flowers gone, weeds a foot high covered it. She\nturned away and went on down the path until she was almost in sight of\nthe cabin.\n\nMrs. Comstock smiled and waited in the arbour until it occurred to her\nthat Elnora was a long time coming, so she went to the gate. The road\nstretched away toward the Limberlost empty and lonely. Then she knew\nthat Elnora had gone into their own woods and would come in the back\nway. She could not understand why the girl did not hurry to her with\nwhat she would have to tell. She went out and wandered around the\ngarden. Then she stepped into the path and started along the way leading\nto the woods, past the pool now framed in a thick setting of yellow\nlilies. Then she saw, and stopped, gasping for breath. Her hands flew up\nand her lined face grew ghastly. She stared at the sky and then at the\nprostrate girl figure. Over and over she tried to speak, but only a dry\nbreath came. She turned and fled back to the garden.\n\nIn the familiar enclosure she gazed around her like a caged animal\nseeking escape. The sun beat down on her bare head mercilessly, and\nmechanically she moved to the shade of a half-grown hickory tree that\nvoluntarily had sprouted beside the milk house. At her feet lay an axe\nwith which she made kindlings for fires. She stooped and picked it up.\nThe memory of that prone figure sobbing in the grass caught her with\na renewed spasm. She shut her eyes as if to close it out. That made\nhearing so acute she felt certain she heard Elnora moaning beside the\npath. The eyes flew open. They looked straight at a few spindling tomato\nplants set too near the tree and stunted by its shade. Mrs. Comstock\nwhirled on the hickory and swung the axe. Her hair shook down, her\nclothing became disarranged, in the heat the perspiration streamed, but\nstroke fell on stroke until the tree crashed over, grazing a corner of\nthe milk house and smashing the garden fence on the east.\n\nAt the sound Elnora sprang to her feet and came running down the garden\nwalk. “Mother!” she cried. “Mother! What in the world are you doing?”\n\nMrs. Comstock wiped her ghastly face on her apron. “I've laid out to cut\nthat tree for years,” she said. “It shades the beets in the morning, and\nthe tomatoes in the afternoon!”\n\nElnora uttered one wild little cry and fled into her mother's arms. “Oh\nmother!” she sobbed. “Will you ever forgive me?”\n\nMrs. Comstock's arms swept together in a tight grip around Elnora.\n\n“There isn't a thing on God's footstool from a to izzard I won't forgive\nyou, my precious girl!” she said. “Tell mother what it is!”\n\nElnora lifted her wet face. “He told me,” she panted, “just as soon as\nhe decently could--that second day he told me. Almost all his life he's\nbeen engaged to a girl at home. He never cared anything about me. He was\nonly interested in the moths and growing strong.”\n\nMrs. Comstock's arms tightened. With a shaking hand she stroked the\nbright hair.\n\n“Tell me, honey,” she said. “Is he to blame for a single one of these\ntears?”\n\n“Not one!” sobbed Elnora. “Oh mother, I won't forgive you if you don't\nbelieve that. Not one! He never said, or looked, or did anything all the\nworld might not have known. He likes me very much as a friend. He hated\nto go dreadfully!”\n\n“Elnora!” the mother's head bent until the white hair mingled with the\nbrown. “Elnora, why didn't you tell me at first?”\n\nElnora caught her breath in a sharp snatch. “I know I should!” she\nsobbed. “I will bear any punishment for not, but I didn't feel as if I\npossibly could. I was afraid.”\n\n“Afraid of what?” the shaking hand was on the hair again.\n\n“Afraid you wouldn't let him come!” panted Elnora. “And oh, mother, I\nwanted him so!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nWHEREIN MRS. COMSTOCK EXPERIMENTS WITH REJUVENATION, AND ELNORA TEACHES\nNATURAL HISTORY\n\n\nFor the following week Mrs. Comstock and Elnora worked so hard there\nwas no time to talk, and they were compelled to sleep from physical\nexhaustion. Neither of them made any pretence of eating, for they could\nnot swallow without an effort, so they drank milk and worked. Elnora\nkept on setting bait for Catacolae and Sphinginae, which, unlike the\nbig moths of June, live several months. She took all the dragonflies and\nbutterflies she could, and when she went over the list for the man of\nIndia, she found, to her amazement, that with Philip's help she once\nmore had it complete save a pair of Yellow Emperors.\n\nThis circumstance was so surprising she had a fleeting thought of\nwriting Philip and asking him to see if he could not secure her a pair.\nShe did tell the Bird Woman, who from every source at her command tried\nto complete the series with these moths, but could not find any for\nsale.\n\n“I think the mills of the Gods are grinding this grist,” said Elnora,\n“and we might as well wait patiently until they choose to send a Yellow\nEmperor.”\n\nMrs. Comstock invented work. When she had nothing more to do, she hoed\nin the garden although the earth was hard and dry and there were no\nplants that really needed attention. Then came a notification that\nElnora would be compelled to attend a week's session of the Teachers'\nInstitute held at the county seat twenty miles north of Onabasha the\nfollowing week. That gave them something of which to think and real\nwork to do. Elnora was requested to bring her violin. As she was on the\nprogramme of one of the most important sessions for a talk on nature\nwork in grade schools, she was driven to prepare her speech, also to\nselect and practise some music. Her mother turned her attention to\nclothing.\n\nThey went to Onabasha together and purchased a simple and appropriate\nfall suit and hat, goods for a dainty little coloured frock, and a dress\nskirt and several fancy waists. Margaret Sinton came down and the sewing\nbegan. When everything was finished and packed, Elnora kissed her mother\ngood-bye at the depot, and entered the train. Mrs. Comstock went into\nthe waiting-room and dropped into a seat to rest. Her heart was so sore\nher whole left side felt tender. She was half starved for the food she\nhad no appetite to take. She had worked in dogged determination until\nshe was exhausted. For a time she simply sat and rested. Then she began\nto think. She was glad Elnora had gone where she would be compelled to\nfix her mind on other matters for a few days. She remembered the girl\nhad said she wanted to go.\n\nSchool would begin the following week. She thought over what Elnora\nwould have to do to accomplish her work successfully. She would be\ncompelled to arise at six o'clock, walk three miles through varying\nweather, lead the high school orchestra, and then put in the remainder\nof the day travelling from building to building over the city, teaching\na specified length of time every week in each room. She must have her\nobject lessons ready, and she must do a certain amount of practising\nwith the orchestra. Then a cold lunch at noon, and a three-mile walk at\nnight.\n\n“Humph!” said Mrs. Comstock, “to get through that the girl would have to\nbe made of cast-iron. I wonder how I can help her best?”\n\nShe thought deeply.\n\n“The less she sees of what she's been having all summer, the sooner\nshe'll feel better about it,” she muttered.\n\nShe arose, went to the bank and inquired for the cashier.\n\n“I want to know just how I am fixed here,” she said.\n\nThe cashier laughed. “You haven't been in a hurry,” he replied. “We have\nbeen ready for you any time these twenty years, but you didn't seem to\npay much attention. Your account is rather flourishing. Interest, when\nit gets to compounding, is quite a money breeder. Come back here to a\ntable and I will show you your balances.”\n\nMrs. Comstock sank into a chair and waited while the cashier read a\njumble of figures to her. It meant that her deposits had exceeded her\nexpenses from one to three hundred dollars a year, according to the\ncattle, sheep, hogs, poultry, butter, and eggs she had sold. The\naggregate of these sums had been compounding interest throughout the\nyears. Mrs. Comstock stared at the total with dazed and unbelieving\neyes. Through her sick heart rushed the realization, that if she merely\nhad stood before that wicket and asked one question, she would have\nknown that all those bitter years of skimping for Elnora and herself had\nbeen unnecessary. She arose and went back to the depot.\n\n“I want to send a message,” she said. She picked up the pencil, and with\nrash extravagance, wrote, “Found money at bank didn't know about. If you\nwant to go to college, come on first train and get ready.” She hesitated\na second and then she said to herself grimly, “Yes, I'll pay for that,\ntoo,” and recklessly added, “With love, Mother.” Then she sat waiting\nfor the answer. It came in less than an hour. “Will teach this winter.\nWith dearest love, Elnora.”\n\nMrs. Comstock held the message a long time. When she arose she was\nravenously hungry, but the pain in her heart was a little easier. She\nwent to a restaurant and ate some food, then to a dressmaker where she\nordered four dresses: two very plain every-day ones, a serviceable dark\ngray cloth suit, and a soft light gray silk with touches of lavender\nand lace. She made a heavy list of purchases at Brownlee's, and the\nremainder of the day she did business in her direct and spirited way.\nAt night she was so tired she scarcely could walk home, but she built a\nfire and cooked and ate a hearty meal.\n\nLater she went out beside the west fence and gathered an armful of tansy\nwhich she boiled to a thick green tea. Then she stirred in oatmeal until\nit was a stiff paste. She spread a sheet over her bed and began tearing\nstrips of old muslin. She bandaged each hand and arm with the mixture\nand plastered the soggy, evil-smelling stuff in a thick poultice over\nher face and neck. She was so tired she went to sleep, and when she\nawoke she was half skinned. She bathed her face and hands, did the\nwork and went back to town, coming home at night to go through the same\nprocess.\n\nBy the third morning she was a raw even red, the fourth she had faded\nto a brilliant pink under the soothing influence of a cream recommended.\nThat day came a letter from Elnora saying that she would remain where\nshe was until Saturday morning, and then come to Ellen Brownlee's at\nOnabasha and stay for the Saturday's session of teachers to arrange\ntheir year's work. Sunday was Ellen's last day at home, and she wanted\nElnora very much. She had to call together the orchestra and practise\nthem Sunday; and could not come home until after school Monday night.\nMrs. Comstock at once answered the letter saying those arrangements\nsuited her.\n\nThe following day she was a pale pink, later a delicate porcelain white.\nThen she went to a hairdresser and had the rope of snowy hair which\ncovered her scalp washed, dressed, and fastened with such pins and combs\nas were decided to be most becoming. She took samples of her dresses,\nwent to a milliner, and bought a street hat to match her suit, and a\ngray satin with lavender orchids to wear with the silk dress. Her last\ninvestment was a loose coat of soft gray broadcloth with white lining,\nand touches of lavender on the embroidered collar, and gray gloves to\nmatch.\n\nThen she went home, rested and worked by turns until Monday. When school\nclosed on that evening, Elnora, so tired she almost trembled, came down\nthe long walk after a late session of teachers' meeting, to be stopped\nby a messenger boy.\n\n“There's a lady wants to see you most important. I am to take you to the\nplace,” he said.\n\nElnora groaned. She could not imagine who wanted her, but there was\nnothing to do but find out; tired and anxious to see her mother as she\nwas.\n\n“This is the place,” said the boy, and went his way whistling. Elnora\nwas three blocks from the high school building on the same street. She\nwas before a quaint old house, fresh with paint and covered with vines.\nThere was a long wide lot, grass-covered, closely set with trees, and\na barn and chicken park at the back that seemed to be occupied. Elnora\nstepped on the veranda which was furnished with straw rugs, bent-hickory\nchairs, hanging baskets, and a table with a work-box and magazines, and\nknocked at the screen door.\n\nInside she could see polished floors, walls freshly papered in low-toned\nharmonious colours, straw rugs and madras curtains. It seemed to be a\nrestful, homelike place to which she had come. A second later down an\nopen stairway came a tall, dark-eyed woman with cheeks faintly pink and\na crown of fluffy snow-white hair. She wore a lavender gingham dress\nwith white collar and cuffs, and she called as she advanced: “That\nscreen isn't latched! Open it and come see your brand-new mother, my\ngirl.”\n\nElnora stepped inside the door. “Mother!” she cried. “You my mother! I\ndon't believe it!”\n\n“Well, you better!” said Mrs. Comstock, “because it's true! You said you\nwished I were like the other girls' mothers, and I've shot as close the\nmark as I could without any practice. I thought that walk would be too\nmuch for you this winter, so I just rented this house and moved in, to\nbe near you, and help more in case I'm needed. I've only lived here a\nday, but I like it so well I've a mortal big notion to buy the place.”\n\n“But mother!” protested Elnora, clinging to her wonderingly. “You are\nperfectly beautiful, and this house is a little paradise, but how will\nwe ever pay for it? We can't afford it!”\n\n“Humph! Have you forgotten I telegraphed you I'd found some money I\ndidn't know about? All I've done is paid for, and plenty more to settle\nfor all I propose to do.”\n\nMrs. Comstock glanced around with satisfaction.\n\n“I may get homesick as a pup before spring,” she said, “but if I do I\ncan go back. If I don't, I'll sell some timber and put a few oil wells\nwhere they don't show much. I can have land enough cleared for a few\nfields and put a tenant on our farm, and we will buy this and settle\nhere. It's for sale.”\n\n“You don't look it, but you've surely gone mad!”\n\n“Just the reverse, my girl,” said Mrs. Comstock, “I've gone sane. If you\nare going to undertake this work, you must be convenient to it. And your\nmother should be where she can see that you are properly dressed, fed,\nand cared for. This is our--let me think--reception-room. How do you\nlike it? This door leads to your workroom and study. I didn't do much\nthere because I wasn't sure of my way. But I knew you would want a rug,\ncurtains, table, shelves for books, and a case for your specimens, so I\nhad a carpenter shelve and enclose that end of it. Looks pretty neat to\nme. The dining-room and kitchen are back, one of the cows in the barn,\nand some chickens in the coop. I understand that none of the other\ngirls' mothers milk a cow, so a neighbour boy will tend to ours for a\nthird of the milk. There are three bedrooms, and a bath upstairs. Go\ntake one, put on some fresh clothes, and come to supper. You can find\nyour room because your things are in it.”\n\nElnora kissed her mother over and over, and hurried upstairs. She\nidentified her room by the dressing-case. There were a pretty rug, and\ncurtains, white iron bed, plain and rocking chairs to match her case,\na shirtwaist chest, and the big closet was filled with her old clothing\nand several new dresses. She found the bathroom, bathed, dressed in\nfresh linen and went down to a supper that was an evidence of Mrs.\nComstock's highest art in cooking. Elnora was so hungry she ate her\nfirst real meal in two weeks. But the bites went down slowly because she\nforgot about them in watching her mother.\n\n“How on earth did you do it?” she asked at last. “I always thought you\nwere naturally brown as a nut.”\n\n“Oh, that was tan and sunburn!” explained Mrs. Comstock. “I always knew\nI was white underneath it. I hated to shade my face because I hadn't\nanything but a sunbonnet, and I couldn't stand for it to touch my ears,\nso I went bareheaded and took all the colour I accumulated. But when\nI began to think of moving you in to your work, I saw I must put up an\nappearance that wouldn't disgrace you, so I thought I'd best remove the\ncrust. It took some time, and I hope I may die before I ever endure the\nfeel and the smell of the stuff I used again, but it skinned me nicely.\nWhat you now see is my own with a little dust of rice powder, for\nprotection. I'm sort of tender yet.”\n\n“And your lovely, lovely hair?” breathed Elnora.\n\n“Hairdresser did that!” said Mrs. Comstock. “It cost like smoke. But I\nwatched her, and with a little help from you I can wash it alone next\ntime, though it will be hard work. I let her monkey with it until she\nsaid she had found 'my style.' Then I tore it down and had her show me\nhow to build it up again three times. I thought my arms would drop. When\nI paid the bill for her work, the time I'd taken, the pins, and combs\nshe'd used, I nearly had heart failure, but I didn't turn a hair before\nher. I just smiled at her sweetly and said, 'How reasonable you are!'\nCome to think of it, she was! She might have charged me ten dollars for\nwhat she did quite as well as nine seventy-five. I couldn't have helped\nmyself. I had made no bargain to begin on.”\n\nThen Elnora leaned back in her chair and shouted, in a gust of hearty\nlaughter, so a little of the ache ceased in her breast. There was no\ntime to think, the remainder of that evening, she was so tired she had\nto sleep, while her mother did not awaken her until she barely had time\nto dress, breakfast and reach school. There was nothing in the new life\nto remind her of the old. It seemed as if there never came a minute for\nretrospection, but her mother appeared on the scene with more work, or\nsome entertaining thing to do.\n\nMrs. Comstock invited Elnora's friends to visit her, and proved herself\na bright and interesting hostess. She digested a subject before she\nspoke; and when she advanced a view, her point was sure to be original\nand tersely expressed. Before three months people waited to hear what\nshe had to say. She kept her appearance so in mind that she made a\nhandsome and a distinguished figure.\n\nElnora never mentioned Philip Ammon, neither did Mrs. Comstock. Early in\nDecember came a note and a big box from him. It contained several books\non nature subjects which would be of much help in school work, a number\nof conveniences Elnora could not afford, and a pair of glass-covered\nplaster casts, for each large moth she had. In these the upper and\nunderwings of male and female showed. He explained that she would break\nher specimens easily, carrying them around in boxes. He had seen these\nand thought they would be of use. Elnora was delighted with them, and\nat once began the tedious process of softening the mounted moths and\nfitting them to the casts moulded to receive them. Her time was so taken\nin school, she progressed slowly, so her mother undertook this work.\nAfter trying one or two very common ones she learned to handle the most\ndelicate with ease. She took keen pride in relaxing the tense moths,\nfitting them to the cases, polishing the glass covers to the last degree\nand sealing them. The results were beautiful to behold.\n\nSoon after Elnora wrote to Philip:\n\nDEAR FRIEND:\n\nI am writing to thank you for the books, and the box of conveniences\nsent me for my work. I can use everything with fine results. Hope I am\ngiving good satisfaction in my position. You will be interested to learn\nthat when the summer's work was classified and pinned, I again had my\ncomplete collection for the man of India, save a Yellow Emperor. I have\ntried everywhere I know, so has the Bird Woman. We cannot find a pair\nfor sale. Fate is against me, at least this season. I shall have to wait\nuntil next year and try again.\n\nThank you very much for helping me with my collection and for the books\nand cases.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nELNORA COMSTOCK.\n\n\nPhilip was disappointed over that note and instead of keeping it he tore\nit into bits and dropped them into the waste basket.\n\nThat was precisely what Elnora had intended he should do. Christmas\nbrought beautiful cards of greeting to Mrs. Comstock and Elnora, Easter\nothers, and the year ran rapidly toward spring. Elnora's position had\nbeen intensely absorbing, while she had worked with all her power. She\nhad made a wonderful success and won new friends. Mrs. Comstock had\nhelped in every way she could, so she was very popular also.\n\nThroughout the winter they had enjoyed the city thoroughly, and the\nchange of life it afforded, but signs of spring did wonderful things\nto the hearts of the country-bred women. A restlessness began on bright\nFebruary days, calmed during March storms and attacked full force in\nApril. When neither could bear it any longer they were forced to discuss\nthe matter and admit they were growing ill with pure homesickness. They\ndecided to keep the city house during the summer, but to return to the\nfarm to live as soon as school closed.\n\nSo Mrs. Comstock would prepare breakfast and lunch and then slip away to\nthe farm to make up beds in her ploughed garden, plant seeds, trim and\ntend her flowers, and prepare the cabin for occupancy. Then she would go\nhome and make the evening as cheerful as possible for Elnora; in these\ndays she lived only for the girl.\n\nBoth of them were glad when the last of May came and the schools closed.\nThey packed the books and clothing they wished to take into a wagon and\nwalked across the fields to the old cabin. As they approached it, Mrs.\nComstock said to Elnora: “You are sure you won't be lonely here?”\n\nElnora knew what she really meant.\n\n“Quite sure,” she said. “For a time last fall I was glad to be away, but\nthat all wore out with the winter. Spring made me homesick as I could\nbe. I can scarcely wait until we get back again.”\n\nSo they began that summer as they had begun all others--with work. But\nboth of them took a new joy in everything, and the violin sang by the\nhour in the twilight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nWHEREIN PHILIP AMMON GIVES A BALL IN HONOUR OF EDITH CARR, AND HART\nHENDERSON APPEARS ON THE SCENE\n\n\nEdith Carr stood in a vine-enclosed side veranda of the Lake Shore Club\nHouse waiting while Philip Ammon gave some important orders. In a few\ndays she would sail for Paris to select a wonderful trousseau she had\nplanned for her marriage in October. To-night Philip was giving a club\ndance in her honour. He had spent days in devising new and exquisite\neffects in decorations, entertainment, and supper. Weeks before the\nfavoured guests had been notified. Days before they had received the\ninvitations asking them to participate in this entertainment by Philip\nAmmon in honour of Miss Carr. They spoke of it as “Phil's dance for\nEdith!”\n\nShe could hear the rumble of carriages and the panting of automobiles\nas in a steady stream they rolled to the front entrance. She could catch\nglimpses of floating draperies of gauze and lace, the flash of jewels,\nand the passing of exquisite colour. Every one was newly arrayed in her\nhonour in the loveliest clothing, and the most expensive jewels they\ncould command. As she thought of it she lifted her head a trifle higher\nand her eyes flashed proudly.\n\nShe was robed in a French creation suggested and designed by Philip.\nHe had said to her: “I know a competent judge who says the distinctive\nfeature of June is her exquisite big night moths. I want you to be the\nvery essence of June that night, as you will be the embodiment of love.\nBe a moth. The most beautiful of them is either the pale-green Luna or\nthe Yellow Imperialis. Be my moon lady, or my gold Empress.”\n\nHe took her to the museum and showed her the moths. She instantly\ndecided on the yellow. Because she knew the shades would make her more\nstartlingly beautiful than any other colour. To him she said: “A moon\nlady seems so far away and cold. I would be of earth and very near on\nthat night. I choose the Empress.”\n\nSo she matched the colours exactly, wrote out the idea and forwarded\nthe order to Paquin. To-night when Philip Ammon came for her, he stood\nspeechless a minute and then silently kissed her hands.\n\nFor she stood tall, lithe, of grace inborn, her dark waving hair high\npiled and crossed by gold bands studded with amethyst and at one side\nan enamelled lavender orchid rimmed with diamonds, which flashed and\nsparkled. The soft yellow robe of lightest weight velvet fitted her form\nperfectly, while from each shoulder fell a great velvet wing lined with\nlavender, and flecked with embroidery of that colour in imitation of the\nmoth. Around her throat was a wonderful necklace and on her arms were\nbracelets of gold set with amethyst and rimmed with diamonds. Philip had\nsaid that her gloves, fan, and slippers must be lavender, because the\nfeet of the moth were that colour. These accessories had been made to\norder and embroidered with gold. It had been arranged that her mother,\nPhilip's, and a few best friends should receive his guests. She was to\nappear when she led the grand march with Philip Ammon. Miss Carr was\npositive that she would be the most beautiful, and most exquisitely\ngowned woman present. In her heart she thought of herself as “Imperialis\nRegalis,” as the Yellow Empress. In a few moments she would stun her\nworld into feeling it as Philip Ammon had done, for she had taken pains\nthat the history of her costume should be whispered to a few who would\ngive it circulation. She lifted her head proudly and waited, for was not\nPhilip planning something unusual and unsurpassed in her honour? Then\nshe smiled.\n\nBut of all the fragmentary thoughts crossing her brain the one that\nnever came was that of Philip Ammon as the Emperor. Philip the king of\nher heart; at least her equal in all things. She was the Empress--yes,\nPhilip was but a mere man, to devise entertainments, to provide\nluxuries, to humour whims, to kiss hands!\n\n“Ah, my luck!” cried a voice behind her.\n\nEdith Carr turned and smiled.\n\n“I thought you were on the ocean,” she said.\n\n“I only reached the dock,” replied the man, “when I had a letter that\nrecalled me by the first limited.”\n\n“Oh! Important business?”\n\n“The only business of any importance in all the world to me. I'm\ntriumphant that I came. Edith, you are the most superb woman in every\nrespect that I have ever seen. One glimpse is worth the whole journey.”\n\n“You like my dress?” She moved toward him and turned, lifting her arms.\n“Do you know what it is intended to represent?”\n\n“Yes, Polly Ammon told me. I knew when I heard about it how you would\nlook, so I started a sleuth hunt, to get the first peep. Edith, I can\nbecome intoxicated merely with looking at you to-night.”\n\nHe half-closed his eyes and smilingly stared straight at her. He was\ntaller than she, a lean man, with close-cropped light hair, steel-gray\neyes, a square chin and “man of the world” written all over him.\n\nEdith Carr flushed. “I thought you realized when you went away that you\nwere to stop that, Hart Henderson,” she cried.\n\n“I did, but this letter of which I tell you called me back to start it\nall over again.”\n\nShe came a step closer. “Who wrote that letter, and what did it contain\nconcerning me?” she demanded.\n\n“One of your most intimate chums wrote it. It contained the hazard that\npossibly I had given up too soon. It said that in a fit of petulance you\nhad broken your engagement with Ammon twice this winter, and he had come\nback because he knew you did not really mean it. I thought deeply there\non the dock when I read that, and my boat sailed without me. I argued\nthat anything so weak as an engagement twice broken and patched up again\nwas a mighty frail affair indeed, and likely to smash completely at any\ntime, so I came on the run. I said once I would not see you marry any\nother man. Because I could not bear it, I planned to go into exile of\nany sort to escape that. I have changed my mind. I have come back to\nhaunt you until the ceremony is over. Then I go, not before. I was\ninsane!”\n\nThe girl laughed merrily. “Not half so insane as you are now, Hart!” she\ncried gaily. “You know that Philip Ammon has been devoted to me all my\nlife. Now I'll tell you something else, because this looks serious for\nyou. I love him with all my heart. Not while he lives shall he know it,\nand I will laugh at him if you tell him, but the fact remains: I intend\nto marry him, but no doubt I shall tease him constantly. It's good for\na man to be uncertain. If you could see Philip's face at the quarterly\nreturn of his ring, you would understand the fun of it. You had better\nhave taken your boat.”\n\n“Possibly,” said Henderson calmly. “But you are the only woman in the\nworld for me, and while you are free, as I now see my light, I remain\nnear you. You know the old adage.”\n\n“But I'm not 'free!'” cried Edith Carr. “I'm telling you I am not. This\nnight is my public acknowledgment that Phil and I are promised, as our\nworld has surmised since we were children. That promise is an actual\nfact, because of what I just have told you. My little fits of temper\ndon't count with Phil. He's been reared on them. In fact, I often\ninvent one in a perfect calm to see him perform. He is the most amusing\nspectacle. But, please, please, do understand that I love him, and\nalways shall, and that we shall be married.”\n\n“Just the same, I'll wait and see it an accomplished fact,” said\nHenderson. “And Edith, because I love you, with the sort of love it is\nworth a woman's while to inspire, I want your happiness before my own.\nSo I am going to say this to you, for I never dreamed you were capable\nof the feeling you have displayed for Phil. If you do love him, and have\nloved him always, a disappointment would cut you deeper than you know.\nGo careful from now on! Don't strain that patched engagement of yours\nany further. I've known Philip all my life. I've known him through\nboyhood, in college, and since. All men respect him. Where the rest\nof us confess our sins, he stands clean. You can go to his arms with\nnothing to forgive. Mark this thing! I have heard him say, 'Edith is my\nslogan,' and I have seen him march home strong in the strength of his\nlove for you, in the face of temptations before which every other man of\nus fell. Before the gods! that ought to be worth something to a girl, if\nshe really is the delicate, sensitive, refined thing she would have man\nbelieve. It would take a woman with the organism of an ostrich to endure\nsome of the men here to-night, if she knew them as I do; but Phil is\nsound to the core. So this is what I would say to you: first, your\ninstincts are right in loving him, why not let him feel it in the ways a\nwoman knows? Second, don't break your engagement again. As men know the\nman, any of us would be afraid to the soul. He loves you, yes! He is\nlong-suffering for you, yes! But men know he has a limit. When the limit\nis reached, he will stand fast, and all the powers can't move him. You\ndon't seem to think it, but you can go too far!”\n\n“Is that all?” laughed Edith Carr sarcastically.\n\n“No, there is one thing more,” said Henderson. “Here or here-after,\nnow and so long as I breathe, I am your slave. You can do anything you\nchoose and know that I will kneel before you again. So carry this in\nthe depths of your heart; now or at any time, in any place or condition,\nmerely lift your hand, and I will come. Anything you want of me, that\nthing will I do. I am going to wait; if you need me, it is not necessary\nto speak; only give me the faintest sign. All your life I will be\nsomewhere near you waiting for it.”\n\n“Idjit! You rave!” laughed Edith Carr. “How you would frighten me! What\na bugbear you would raise! Be sensible and go find what keeps Phil. I\nwas waiting patiently, but my patience is going. I won't look nearly so\nwell as I do now when it is gone.”\n\nAt that instant Philip Ammon entered. He was in full evening dress\nand exceptionally handsome. “Everything is ready,” he said; “they are\nwaiting for us to lead the march. It is formed.”\n\nEdith Carr smiled entrancingly. “Do you think I am ready?”\n\nPhilip looked what he thought, and offered his arm. Edith Carr nodded\ncarelessly to Hart Henderson, and moved away. Attendants parted the\ncurtains and the Yellow Empress bowing right and left, swept the length\nof the ballroom and took her place at the head of the formed procession.\nThe large open dancing pavilion was draped with yellow silk caught up\nwith lilac flowers. Every corner was filled with bloom of those colours.\nThe music was played by harpers dressed in yellow and violet, so the\nball opened.\n\nThe midnight supper was served with the same colours and the last half\nof the programme was being danced. Never had girl been more complimented\nand petted in the same length of time than Edith Carr. Every minute she\nseemed to grow more worthy of praise. A partners' dance was called and\nthe floor was filled with couples waiting for the music. Philip stood\nwhispering delightful things to Edith facing him. From out of the night,\nin at the wide front entrance to the pavilion, there swept in slow\nwavering flight a large yellow moth and fluttered toward the centre\ncluster of glaring electric lights. Philip Ammon and Edith Carr saw it\nat the same instant.\n\n“Why, isn't that----?” she began excitedly.\n\n“It's a Yellow Emperor! This is fate!” cried Philip. “The last one\nElnora needs for her collection. I must have it! Excuse me!”\n\nHe ran toward the light. “Hats! Handkerchiefs! Fans! Anything!” he\npanted. “Every one hold up something and stop that! It's a moth; I've\ngot to catch it!”\n\n“It's yellow! He wants it for Edith!” ran in a murmur around the hall.\nThe girl's face flushed, while she bit her lips in vexation.\n\nInstantly every one began holding up something to keep the moth from\nflying back into the night. One fan held straight before it served, and\nthe moth gently settled on it.\n\n“Hold steady!” cried Philip. “Don't move for your life!” He rushed\ntoward the moth, made a quick sweep and held it up between his fingers.\n“All right!” he called. “Thanks, every one! Excuse me a minute.”\n\nHe ran to the office.\n\n“An ounce of gasolene, quick!” he ordered. “A cigar box, a cork, and the\nglue bottle.”\n\nHe poured some glue into the bottom of the box, set the cork in it\nfirmly, dashed the gasolene over the moth repeatedly, pinned it to the\ncork, poured the remainder of the liquid over it, closed the box, and\nfastened it. Then he laid a bill on the counter.\n\n“Pack that box with cork around it, in one twice its size, tie securely\nand express to this address at once.”\n\nHe scribbled on a sheet of paper and shoved it over.\n\n“On your honour, will you do that faithfully as I say?” he asked the\nclerk.\n\n“Certainly,” was the reply.\n\n“Then keep the change,” called Philip as he ran back to the pavilion.\n\nEdith Carr stood where he left her, thinking rapidly. She heard the\nmurmur that arose when Philip started to capture the exquisite golden\ncreature she was impersonating. She saw the flash of surprise that went\nover unrestrained faces when he ran from the room, without even showing\nit to her. “The last one Elnora needs,” rang in her ears. He had told\nher that he helped collect moths the previous summer, but she had\nunderstood that the Bird Woman, with whose work Miss Carr was familiar,\nwanted them to put in a book.\n\nHe had spoken of a country girl he had met who played the violin\nwonderfully, and at times, he had shown a disposition to exalt her as a\nstandard of womanhood. Miss Carr had ignored what he said, and talked of\nsomething else. But that girl's name had been Elnora. It was she who\nwas collecting moths! No doubt she was the competent judge who was\nresponsible for the yellow costume Philip had devised. Had Edith Carr\nbeen in her room, she would have torn off the dress at the thought.\n\nBeing in a circle of her best friends, which to her meant her keenest\nrivals and harshest critics, she grew rigid with anger. Her breath hurt\nher paining chest. No one thought to speak to the musicians, and seeing\nthe floor filled, they began the waltz. Only part of the guests could\nsee what had happened, and at once the others formed and commenced to\ndance. Gay couples came whirling past her.\n\nEdith Carr grew very white as she stood alone. Her lips turned pale,\nwhile her dark eyes flamed with anger. She stood perfectly still where\nPhilip had left her, and the approaching men guided their partners\naround her, while the girls, looking back, could be seen making\nexclamations of surprise.\n\nThe idolized only daughter of the Carr family hoped that she would drop\ndead from mortification, but nothing happened. She was too perverse\nto step aside and say that she was waiting for Philip. Then came Tom\nLevering dancing with Polly Ammon. Being in the scales with the Ammon\nfamily, Tom scented trouble from afar, so he whispered to Polly: “Edith\nis standing in the middle of the floor, and she's awful mad about\nsomething.”\n\n“That won't hurt her,” laughed Polly. “It's an old pose of hers. She\nknows she looks superb when she is angry, so she keeps herself furious\nhalf the time on purpose.”\n\n“She looks like the mischief!” answered Tom. “Hadn't we better steer\nover and wait with her? She's the ugliest sight I ever saw!”\n\n“Why, Tom!” cried Polly. “Stop, quickly!”\n\nThey hurried to Edith.\n\n“Come dear,” said Polly. “We are going to wait with you until Phil\nreturns. Let's go after a drink. I am so thirsty!”\n\n“Yes, do!” begged Tom, offering his arm. “Let's get out of here until\nPhil comes.”\n\nThere was the opportunity to laugh and walk away, but Edith Carr would\nnot accept it.\n\n“My betrothed left me here,” she said. “Here I shall remain until he\nreturns for me, and then--he will be my betrothed no longer!”\n\nPolly grasped Edith's arm.\n\n“Oh, Edith!” she implored. “Don't make a scene here, and to-night.\nEdith, this has been the loveliest dance ever given at the club house.\nEvery one is saying so. Edith! Darling, do come! Phil will be back in\na second. He can explain! It's only a breath since I saw him go out. I\nthought he had returned.”\n\nAs Polly panted these disjointed ejaculations, Tom Levering began to\ngrow angry on her account.\n\n“He has been gone just long enough to show every one of his guests that\nhe will leave me standing alone, like a neglected fool, for any passing\nwhim of his. Explain! His explanation would sound well! Do you know for\nwhom he caught that moth? It is being sent to a girl he flirted with all\nlast summer. It has just occurred to me that the dress I am wearing is\nher suggestion. Let him try to explain!”\n\nSpeech unloosed the fountain. She stripped off her gloves to free her\nhands. At that instant the dancers parted to admit Philip. Instinctively\nthey stopped as they approached and with wondering faces walled in Edith\nand Philip, Polly and Tom.\n\n“Mighty good of you to wait!” cried Philip, his face showing his delight\nover his success in capturing the Yellow Emperor. “I thought when I\nheard the music you were going on.”\n\n“How did you think I was going on?” demanded Edith Carr in frigid tones.\n\n“I thought you would step aside and wait a few seconds for me, or dance\nwith Henderson. It was most important to have that moth. It completes a\nvaluable collection for a person who needs the money. Come!”\n\nHe held out his arms.\n\n“I 'step aside' for no one!” stormed Edith Carr. “I await no other\ngirl's pleasure! You may 'complete the collection' with that!”\n\nShe drew her engagement ring from her finger and reached to place it\non one of Philip's outstretched hands. He saw and drew back. Instantly\nEdith dropped the ring. As it fell, almost instinctively Philip caught\nit in air. With amazed face he looked closely at Edith Carr. Her\ndistorted features were scarcely recognizable. He held the ring toward\nher.\n\n“Edith, for the love of mercy, wait until I can explain,” he begged.\n“Put on your ring and let me tell you how it is.”\n\n“I know perfectly 'how it is,'” she answered. “I never shall wear that\nring again.”\n\n“You won't even hear what I have to say? You won't take back your ring?”\n he cried.\n\n“Never! Your conduct is infamous!”\n\n“Come to think of it,” said Philip deliberately, “it is 'infamous' to\ncut a girl, who has danced all her life, out of a few measures of a\nwaltz. As for asking forgiveness for so black a sin as picking up a\nmoth, and starting it to a friend who lives by collecting them, I don't\nsee how I could! I have not been gone three minutes by the clock, Edith.\nPut on your ring and finish the dance like a dear girl.”\n\nHe thrust the glittering ruby into her fingers and again held out his\narms. She dropped the ring, and it rolled some distance from them. Hart\nHenderson followed its shining course, and caught it before it was lost.\n\n“You really mean it?” demanded Philip in a voice as cold as hers ever\nhad been.\n\n“You know I mean it!” cried Edith Carr.\n\n“I accept your decision in the presence of these witnesses,” said Philip\nAmmon. “Where is my father?” The elder Ammon with a distressed face\nhurried to him. “Father, take my place,” said Philip. “Excuse me to my\nguests. Ask all my friends to forgive me. I am going away for awhile.”\n\nHe turned and walked from the pavilion. As he went Hart Henderson rushed\nto Edith Carr and forced the ring into her fingers. “Edith, quick. Come,\nquick!” he implored. “There's just time to catch him. If you let him go\nthat way, he never will return in this world. Remember what I told you.”\n\n“Great prophet! aren't you, Hart?” she sneered. “Who wants him to\nreturn? If that ring is thrust upon me again I shall fling it into the\nlake. Signal the musicians to begin, and dance with me.”\n\nHenderson put the ring into his pocket, and began the dance. He could\nfeel the muscular spasms of the girl in his arms, her face was cold and\nhard, but her breath burned with the scorch of fever. She finished the\ndance and all others, taking Phil's numbers with Henderson, who had\narrived too late to arrange a programme. She left with the others,\nmerely inclining her head as she passed Ammon's father taking his place,\nand entered the big touring car for which Henderson had telephoned. She\nsank limply into a seat and moaned softly.\n\n“Shall I drive awhile in the night air?” asked Henderson.\n\nShe nodded. He instructed the chauffeur.\n\nShe raised her head in a few seconds. “Hart, I'm going to pieces,” she\nsaid. “Won't you put your arm around me a little while?”\n\nHenderson gathered her into his arms and her head fell on his shoulder.\n“Closer!” she cried.\n\nHenderson held her until his arms were numb, but he did not know it. The\ntricks of fate are cruel enough, but there scarcely could have been a\nworse one than that: To care for a woman as he loved Edith Carr and have\nher given into his arms because she was so numb with misery over her\ntrouble with another man that she did not know or care what she did.\nDawn was streaking the east when he spoke to her.\n\n“Edith, it is growing light.”\n\n“Take me home,” she said.\n\nHenderson helped her up the steps and rang the bell.\n\n“Miss Carr is ill,” he said to the footman. “Arouse her maid instantly,\nand have her prepare something hot as quickly as possible.”\n\n“Edith,” he cried, “just a word. I have been thinking. It isn't too late\nyet. Take your ring and put it on. I will go find Phil at once and tell\nhim you have, that you are expecting him, and he will come.”\n\n“Think what he said!” she cried. “He accepted my decision as final, 'in\nthe presence of witnesses,' as if it were court. He can return it to me,\nif I ever wear it again.”\n\n“You think that now, but in a few days you will find that you feel very\ndifferently. Living a life of heartache is no joke, and no job for a\nwoman. Put on your ring and send me to tell him to come.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Edith, there was not a soul who saw that, but sympathized with Phil.\nIt was ridiculous for you to get so angry over a thing which was never\nintended for the slightest offence, and by no logical reasoning could\nhave been so considered.”\n\n“Do you think that?” she demanded.\n\n“I do!” said Henderson. “If you had laughed and stepped aside an\ninstant, or laughed and stayed where you were, Phil would have been\nback; or, if he needed punishment in your eyes, to have found me having\none of his dances would have been enough. I was waiting. You could have\ncalled me with one look. But to publicly do and say what you did, my\nlady--I know Phil, and I know you went too far. Put on that ring, and\nsend him word you are sorry, before it is too late.”\n\n“I will not! He shall come to me.”\n\n“Then God help you!” said Henderson, “for you are plunging into misery\nwhose depth you do not dream. Edith, I beg of you----”\n\nShe swayed where she stood. Her maid opened the door and caught her.\nHenderson went down the hall and out to his car.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nWHEREIN THE ELDER AMMON OFFERS ADVICE, AND EDITH CARR EXPERIENCES\nREGRETS\n\n\nPhilip Ammon walked from among his friends a humiliated and a wounded\nman. Never before had Edith Carr appeared quite so beautiful. All\nevening she had treated him with unusual consideration. Never had he\nloved her so deeply. Then in a few seconds everything was different.\nSeeing the change in her face, and hearing her meaningless accusations,\nkilled something in his heart. Warmth went out and a cold weight took\nits place. But even after that, he had offered the ring to her again,\nand asked her before others to reconsider. The answer had been further\ninsult.\n\nHe walked, paying no heed to where he went. He had traversed many miles\nwhen he became aware that his feet had chosen familiar streets. He was\npassing his home. Dawn was near, but the first floor was lighted. He\nstaggered up the steps and was instantly admitted. The library door\nstood open, while his father sat with a book pretending to read. At\nPhilip's entrance the father scarcely glanced up.\n\n“Come on!” he called. “I have just told Banks to bring me a cup of\ncoffee before I turn in. Have one with me!”\n\nPhilip sat beside the table and leaned his head on his hands, but he\ndrank a cup of steaming coffee and felt better.\n\n“Father,” he said, “father, may I talk with you a little while?”\n\n“Of course,” answered Mr. Ammon. “I am not at all tired. I think I\nmust have been waiting in the hope that you would come. I want no one's\nversion of this but yours. Tell me the straight of the thing, Phil.”\n\nPhilip told all he knew, while his father sat in deep thought.\n\n“On my life I can't see any occasion for such a display of temper, Phil.\nIt passed all bounds of reason and breeding. Can't you think of anything\nmore?”\n\n“I cannot!”\n\n“Polly says every one expected you to carry the moth you caught to\nEdith. Why didn't you?”\n\n“She screams if a thing of that kind comes near her. She never has taken\nthe slightest interest in them. I was in a big hurry. I didn't want to\nmiss one minute of my dance with her. The moth was not so uncommon, but\nby a combination of bad luck it had become the rarest in America for a\nfriend of mine, who is making a collection to pay college expenses.\nFor an instant last June the series was completed; when a woman's\nuncontrolled temper ruined this specimen and the search for it began\nover. A few days later a pair was secured, and again the money was in\nsight for several hours. Then an accident wrecked one-fourth of the\ncollection. I helped replace those last June, all but this Yellow\nEmperor which we could not secure, and we haven't been able to find, buy\nor trade for one since. So my friend was compelled to teach this past\nwinter instead of going to college. When that moth came flying in there\nto-night, it seemed to me like fate. All I thought of was, that to\nsecure it would complete the collection and secure the money. So I\ncaught the Emperor and started it to Elnora. I declare to you that I was\nnot out of the pavilion over three minutes at a liberal estimate. If I\nonly had thought to speak to the orchestra! I was sure I would be back\nbefore enough couples gathered and formed for the dance.”\n\nThe eyes of the father were very bright.\n\n“The friend for whom you wanted the moth is a girl?” he asked\nindifferently, as he ran the book leaves through his fingers.\n\n“The girl of whom I wrote you last summer, and told you about in the\nfall. I helped her all the time I was away.”\n\n“Did Edith know of her?”\n\n“I tried many times to tell her, to interest her, but she was so\nindifferent that it was insulting. She would not hear me.”\n\n“We are neither one in any condition to sleep. Why don't you begin at\nthe first and tell me about this girl? To think of other matters for a\ntime may clear our vision for a sane solution of this. Who is she, just\nwhat is she doing, and what is she like? You know I was reared among\nthose Limberlost people, I can understand readily. What is her name and\nwhere does she live?”\n\nPhilip gave a man's version of the previous summer, while his father\nplayed with the book industriously.\n\n“You are very sure as to her refinement and education?”\n\n“In almost two months' daily association, could a man be mistaken? She\ncan far and away surpass Polly, Edith, or any girl of our set on any\ncommon, high school, or supplementary branch, and you know high schools\nhave French, German, and physics now. Besides, she is a graduate of\ntwo other institutions. All her life she has been in the school of Hard\nKnocks. She has the biggest, tenderest, most human heart I ever knew\nin a girl. She has known life in its most cruel phases, and instead of\nhardening her, it has set her trying to save other people suffering.\nThen this nature position of which I told you; she graduated in the\nSchool of the Woods, before she secured that. The Bird Woman, whose work\nyou know, helped her there. Elnora knows more interesting things in a\nminute than any other girl I ever met knew in an hour, provided you are\na person who cares to understand plant and animal life.”\n\nThe book leaves slid rapidly through his fingers as the father drawled:\n“What sort of looking girl is she?”\n\n“Tall as Edith, a little heavier, pink, even complexion, wide open\nblue-gray eyes with heavy black brows, and lashes so long they touch her\ncheeks. She has a rope of waving, shining hair that makes a real crown\non her head, and it appears almost red in the light. She is as handsome\nas any fair woman I ever saw, but she doesn't know it. Every time any\none pays her a compliment, her mother, who is a caution, discovers that,\nfor some reason, the girl is a fright, so she has no appreciation of her\nlooks.”\n\n“And you were in daily association two months with a girl like that! How\nabout it, Phil?”\n\n“If you mean, did I trifle with her, no!” cried Philip hotly. “I told\nher the second time I met her all about Edith. Almost every day I wrote\nto Edith in her presence. Elnora gathered violets and made a fancy\nbasket to put them in for Edith's birthday. I started to err in too open\nadmiration for Elnora, but her mother brought me up with a whirl I\nnever forgot. Fifty times a day in the swamps and forests Elnora made a\nperfect picture, but I neither looked nor said anything. I never met any\ngirl so downright noble in bearing and actions. I never hated anything\nas I hated leaving her, for we were dear friends, like two wholly\ncongenial men. Her mother was almost always with us. She knew how much I\nadmired Elnora, but so long as I concealed it from the girl, the mother\ndid not care.”\n\n“Yet you left such a girl and came back whole-hearted to Edith Carr!”\n\n“Surely! You know how it has been with me about Edith all my life.”\n\n“Yet the girl you picture is far her superior to an unprejudiced person,\nwhen thinking what a man would require in a wife to be happy.”\n\n“I never have thought what I would 'require' to be happy! I only thought\nwhether I could make Edith happy. I have been an idiot! What I've borne\nyou'll never know! To-night is only one of many outbursts like that, in\nvarying and lesser degrees.”\n\n“Phil, I love you, when you say you have thought only of Edith! I happen\nto know that it is true. You are my only son, and I have had a right to\nwatch you closely. I believe you utterly. Any one who cares for you as\nI do, and has had my years of experience in this world over yours, knows\nthat in some ways, to-night would be a blessed release, if you could\ntake it; but you cannot! Go to bed now, and rest. To-morrow, go back to\nher and fix it up.”\n\n“You heard what I said when I left her! I said it because something in\nmy heart died a minute before that, and I realized that it was my love\nfor Edith Carr. Never again will I voluntarily face such a scene. If she\ncan act like that at a ball, before hundreds, over a thing of which\nI thought nothing at all, she would go into actual physical fits and\nspasms, over some of the household crises I've seen the mater meet with\na smile. Sir, it is truth that I have thought only of her up to the\npresent. Now, I will admit I am thinking about myself. Father, did you\nsee her? Life is too short, and it can be too sweet, to throw it away\nin a battle with an unrestrained woman. I am no fighter--where a girl is\nconcerned, anyway. I respect and love her or I do nothing. Never again\nis either respect or love possible between me and Edith Carr. Whenever\nI think of her in the future, I will see her as she was to-night. But I\ncan't face the crowd just yet. Could you spare me a few days?”\n\n“It is only ten days until you were to go north for the summer, go now.”\n\n“I don't want to go north. I don't want to meet people I know. There,\nthe story would precede me. I do not need pitying glances or rough\ncondolences. I wonder if I could not hide at Uncle Ed's in Wisconsin for\nawhile?”\n\nThe book closed suddenly. The father leaned across the table and looked\ninto the son's eyes.\n\n“Phil, are you sure of what you just have said?”\n\n“Perfectly sure!”\n\n“Do you think you are in any condition to decide to-night?”\n\n“Death cannot return to life, father. My love for Edith Carr is dead. I\nhope never to see her again.”\n\n“If I thought you could be certain so soon! But, come to think of it,\nyou are very like me in many ways. I am with you in this. Public scenes\nand disgraces I would not endure. It would be over with me, were I in\nyour position, that I know.”\n\n“It is done for all time,” said Philip Ammon. “Let us not speak of it\nfurther.”\n\n“Then, Phil,” the father leaned closer and looked at the son tenderly,\n“Phil, why don't you go to the Limberlost?”\n\n“Father!”\n\n“Why not? No one can comfort a hurt heart like a tender woman; and,\nPhil, have you ever stopped to think that you may have a duty in the\nLimberlost, if you are free? I don't know! I only suggest it. But, for a\ncountry schoolgirl, unaccustomed to men, two months with a man like you\nmight well awaken feelings of which you do not think. Because you were\nsafe-guarded is no sign the girl was. She might care to see you. You can\nsoon tell. With you, she comes next to Edith, and you have made it clear\nto me that you appreciate her in many ways above. So I repeat it, why\nnot go to the Limberlost?”\n\nA long time Philip Ammon sat in deep thought. At last he raised his\nhead.\n\n“Well, why not!” he said. “Years could make me no surer than I am now,\nand life is short. Please ask Banks to get me some coffee and toast, and\nI will bathe and dress so I can take the early train.”\n\n“Go to your bath. I will attend to your packing and everything. And\nPhil, if I were you, I would leave no addresses.”\n\n“Not an address!” said Philip. “Not even Polly.”\n\nWhen the train pulled out, the elder Ammon went home to find Hart\nHenderson waiting.\n\n“Where is Phil?” he demanded.\n\n“He did not feel like facing his friends at present, and I am just\nback from driving him to the station. He said he might go to Siam, or\nPatagonia. He would leave no address.”\n\nHenderson almost staggered. “He's not gone? And left no address? You\ndon't mean it! He'll never forgive her!”\n\n“Never is a long time, Hart,” said Mr. Ammon. “And it seems even longer\nto those of us who are well acquainted with Phil. Last night was not the\nlast straw. It was the whole straw-stack. It crushed Phil so far as she\nis concerned. He will not see her again voluntarily, and he will not\nforget if he does. You can take it from him, and from me, we have\naccepted the lady's decision. Will you have a cup of coffee?”\n\nTwice Henderson opened his lips to speak of Edith Carr's despair. Twice\nhe looked into the stern, inflexible face of Mr. Ammon and could not\nbetray her. He held out the ring.\n\n“I have no instructions as to that,” said the elder Ammon, drawing back.\n“Possibly Miss Carr would have it as a keepsake.”\n\n“I am sure not,” said Henderson curtly.\n\n“Then suppose you return it to Peacock. I will phone him. He will give\nyou the price of it, and you might add it to the children's Fresh Air\nFund. We would be obliged if you would do that. No one here cares to\nhandle the object.”\n\n“As you choose,” said Henderson. “Good morning!”\n\nThen he went to his home, but he could not think of sleep. He ordered\nbreakfast, but he could not eat. He paced the library for a time, but it\nwas too small. Going on the streets he walked until exhausted, then\nhe called a hansom and was driven to his club. He had thought himself\nfamiliar with every depth of suffering; that night had taught him that\nwhat he felt for himself was not to be compared with the anguish which\nwrung his heart over the agony of Edith Carr. He tried to blame Philip\nAmmon, but being an honest man, Henderson knew that was unjust. The\nfault lay wholly with her, but that only made it harder for him, as he\nrealized it would in time for her.\n\nAs he sauntered into the room an attendant hurried to him.\n\n“You are wanted most urgently at the 'phone, Mr. Henderson,” he said.\n“You have had three calls from Main 5770.”\n\nHenderson shivered as he picked down the receiver and gave the call.\n\n“Is that you, Hart?” came Edith's voice.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Did you find Phil?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Did you try?”\n\n“Yes. As soon as I left you I went straight there.”\n\n“Wasn't he home yet?”\n\n“He has been home and gone again.”\n\n“Gone!”\n\nThe cry tore Henderson's heart.\n\n“Shall I come and tell you, Edith?”\n\n“No! Tell me now.”\n\n“When I reached the house Banks said Mr. Ammon and Phil were out in the\nmotor, so I waited. Mr. Ammon came back soon. Edith, are you alone?”\n\n“Yes. Go on!”\n\n“Call your maid. I can't tell you until some one is with you.”\n\n“Tell me instantly!”\n\n“Edith, he said he had been to the station. He said Phil had started\nto Siam or Patagonia, he didn't know which, and left no address. He\nsaid----”\n\nDistinctly Henderson heard her fall. He set the buzzer ringing, and in\na few seconds heard voices, so he knew she had been found. Then he crept\ninto a private den and shook with a hard, nervous chill.\n\nThe next day Edith Carr started on her trip to Europe. Henderson\nfelt certain she hoped to meet Philip there. He was sure she would be\ndisappointed, though he had no idea where Ammon could have gone. But\nafter much thought he decided he would see Edith soonest by remaining at\nhome, so he spent the summer in Chicago.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nWHEREIN PHILIP AMMON RETURNS TO THE LIMBERLOST, AND ELNORA STUDIES THE\nSITUATION\n\n\n“We must be thinking about supper, mother,” said Elnora, while she set\nthe wings of a Cecropia with much care. “It seems as if I can't get\nenough to eat, or enough of being at home. I enjoyed that city house. I\ndon't believe I could have done my work if I had been compelled to walk\nback and forth. I thought at first I never wanted to come here again.\nNow, I feel as if I could not live anywhere else.”\n\n“Elnora,” said Mrs. Comstock, “there's some one coming down the road.”\n\n“Coming here, do you think?”\n\n“Yes, coming here, I suspect.”\n\nElnora glanced quickly at her mother and then turned to the road as\nPhilip Ammon reached the gate.\n\n“Careful, mother!” the girl instantly warned. “If you change your\ntreatment of him a hair's breadth, he will suspect. Come with me to meet\nhim.”\n\nShe dropped her work and sprang up.\n\n“Well, of all the delightful surprises!” she cried.\n\nShe was a trifle thinner than during the previous summer. On her face\nthere was a more mature, patient look, but the sun struck her bare head\nwith the same ray of red gold. She wore one of the old blue gingham\ndresses, open at the throat and rolled to the elbows. Mrs. Comstock did\nnot appear at all the same woman, but Philip saw only Elnora; heard only\nher greeting. He caught both hands where she offered but one.\n\n“Elnora,” he cried, “if you were engaged to me, and we were at a ball,\namong hundreds, where I offended you very much, and didn't even know I\nhad done anything, and if I asked you before all of them to allow me\nto explain, to forgive me, to wait, would your face grow distorted and\nunfamiliar with anger? Would you drop my ring on the floor and insult me\nrepeatedly? Oh Elnora, would you?”\n\nElnora's big eyes seemed to leap, while her face grew very white. She\ndrew away her hands.\n\n“Hush, Phil! Hush!” she protested. “That fever has you again! You are\ndreadfully ill. You don't know what you are saying.”\n\n“I am sleepless and exhausted; I'm heartsick; but I am well as I ever\nwas. Answer me, Elnora, would you?”\n\n“Answer nothing!” cried Mrs. Comstock. “Answer nothing! Hang your coat\nthere on your nail, Phil, and come split some kindling. Elnora, clean\naway that stuff, and set the table. Can't you see the boy is starved and\ntired? He's come home to rest and eat a decent meal. Come on, Phil!”\n\nMrs. Comstock marched away, and Philip hung his coat in its old place\nand followed. Out of sight and hearing she turned on him.\n\n“Do you call yourself a man or a hound?” she flared.\n\n“I beg your pardon----” stammered Philip Ammon.\n\n“I should think you would!” she ejaculated. “I'll admit you did the\nsquare thing and was a man last summer, though I'd liked it better if\nyou'd faced up and told me you were promised; but to come back here\nbabying, and take hold of Elnora like that, and talk that way because\nyou have had a fuss with your girl, I don't tolerate. Split that\nkindling and I'll get your supper, and then you better go. I won't have\nyou working on Elnora's big heart, because you have quarrelled with some\none else. You'll have it patched up in a week and be gone again, so you\ncan go right away.”\n\n“Mrs. Comstock, I came to ask Elnora to marry me.”\n\n“The more fool you, then!” cried Mrs. Comstock. “This time yesterday you\nwere engaged to another woman, no doubt. Now, for some little flare-up\nyou come racing here to use Elnora as a tool to spite the other girl.\nA week of sane living, and you will be sorry and ready to go back to\nChicago, or, if you really are man enough to be sure of yourself, she\nwill come to claim you. She has her rights. An engagement of years is a\nserious matter, and not broken for a whim. If you don't go, she'll come.\nThen, when you patch up your affairs and go sailing away together, where\ndoes my girl come in?”\n\n“I am a lawyer, Mrs. Comstock,” said Philip. “It appeals to me as\nbeneath your ordinary sense of justice to decide a case without hearing\nthe evidence. It is due me that you hear me first.”\n\n“Hear your side!” flashed Mrs. Comstock. “I'd a heap sight rather hear\nthe girl!”\n\n“I wish to my soul that you had heard and seen her last night, Mrs.\nComstock,” said Ammon. “Then, my way would be clear. I never even\nthought of coming here to-day. I'll admit I would have come in time, but\nnot for many months. My father sent me.”\n\n“Your father sent you! Why?”\n\n“Father, mother, and Polly were present last night. They, and all\nmy friends, saw me insulted and disgraced in the worst exhibition of\nuncontrolled temper any of us ever witnessed. All of them knew it was\nthe end. Father liked what I had told him of Elnora, and he advised me\nto come here, so I came. If she does not want me, I can leave instantly,\nbut, oh I hoped she would understand!”\n\n“You people are not splitting wood,” called Elnora.\n\n“Oh yes we are!” answered Mrs. Comstock. “You set out the things\nfor biscuit, and lay the table.” She turned again to Philip. “I know\nconsiderable about your father,” she said. “I have met your Uncle's\nfamily frequently this winter. I've heard your Aunt Anna say that she\ndidn't at all like Miss Carr, and that she and all your family secretly\nhoped that something would happen to prevent your marrying her. That\nchimes right in with your saying that your father sent you here. I guess\nyou better speak your piece.”\n\nPhilip gave his version of the previous night.\n\n“Do you believe me?” he finished.\n\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“May I stay?”\n\n“Oh, it looks all right for you, but what about her?”\n\n“Nothing, so far as I am concerned. Her plans were all made to start to\nEurope to-day. I suspect she is on the way by this time. Elnora is very\nsensible, Mrs. Comstock. Hadn't you better let her decide this?”\n\n“The final decision rests with her, of course,” admitted Mrs. Comstock.\n“But look you one thing! She's all I have. As Solomon says, 'she is the\none child, the only child of her mother.' I've suffered enough in this\nworld that I fight against any suffering which threatens her. So far\nas I know you've always been a man, and you may stay. But if you bring\ntears and heartache to her, don't have the assurance to think I'll bear\nit tamely. I'll get right up and fight like a catamount, if things go\nwrong for Elnora!”\n\n“I have no doubt but you will,” replied Philip, “and I don't blame you\nin the least if you do. I have the utmost devotion to offer Elnora, a\ngood home, fair social position, and my family will love her dearly.\nThink it over. I know it is sudden, but my father advised it.”\n\n“Yes, I reckon he did!” said Mrs. Comstock dryly. “I guess instead of\nme being the catamount, you had the genuine article up in Chicago,\nmasquerading in peacock feathers, and posing as a fine lady, until her\ntime came to scratch. Human nature seems to be the same the world over.\nBut I'd give a pretty to know that secret thing you say you don't, that\nset her raving over your just catching a moth for Elnora. You might get\nthat crock of strawberries in the spring house.”\n\nThey prepared and ate supper. Afterward they sat in the arbour and\ntalked, or Elnora played until time for Philip to go.\n\n“Will you walk to the gate with me?” he asked Elnora as he arose.\n\n“Not to-night,” she answered lightly. “Come early in the morning if\nyou like, and we will go over to Sleepy Snake Creek and hunt moths and\ngather dandelions for dinner.”\n\nPhilip leaned toward her. “May I tell you to-morrow why I came?” he\nasked.\n\n“I think not,” replied Elnora. “The fact is, I don't care why you came.\nIt is enough for me that we are your very good friends, and that in\ntrouble, you have found us a refuge. I fancy we had better live a week\nor two before you say anything. There is a possibility that what you\nhave to say may change in that length of time.\n\n“It will not change one iota!” cried Philip.\n\n“Then it will have the grace of that much age to give it some small\ntouch of flavour,” said the girl. “Come early in the morning.”\n\nShe lifted the violin and began to play.\n\n“Well bless my soul!” ejaculated the astounded Mrs. Comstock. “To think\nI was worrying for fear you couldn't take care of yourself!”\n\nElnora laughed while she played.\n\n“Shall I tell you what he said?”\n\n“Nope! I don't want to hear it!” said Elnora. “He is only six hours from\nChicago. I'll give her a week to find him and fix it up, if he stays\nthat long. If she doesn't put in an appearance then, he can tell me what\nhe wants to say, and I'll take my time to think it over. Time in plenty,\ntoo! There are three of us in this, and one must be left with a sore\nheart for life. If the decision rests with me I propose to be very sure\nthat it is the one who deserves such hard luck.”\n\nThe next morning Philip came early, dressed in the outing clothing he\nhad worn the previous summer, and aside from a slight paleness seemed\nvery much the same as when he left. Elnora met him on the old footing,\nand for a week life went on exactly as it had the previous summer. Mrs.\nComstock made mental notes and watched in silence. She could see that\nElnora was on a strain, though she hoped Philip would not. The girl grew\nrestless as the week drew to a close. Once when the gate clicked she\nsuddenly lost colour and moved nervously. Billy came down the walk.\n\nPhilip leaned toward Mrs. Comstock and said: “I am expressly forbidden\nto speak to Elnora as I would like. Would you mind telling her for me\nthat I had a letter from my father this morning saying that Miss Carr is\non her way to Europe for the summer?”\n\n“Elnora,” said Mrs. Comstock promptly, “I have just heard that Carr\nwoman is on her way to Europe, and I wish to my gracious stars she'd\nstay there!”\n\nPhilip Ammon shouted, but Elnora arose hastily and went to meet Billy.\nThey came into the arbour together and after speaking to Mrs. Comstock\nand Philip, Billy said: “Uncle Wesley and I found something funny, and\nwe thought you'd like to see.”\n\n“I don't know what I should do without you and Uncle Wesley to help me,”\n said Elnora. “What have you found now?”\n\n“Something I couldn't bring. You have to come to it. I tried to get one\nand I killed it. They are a kind of insecty things, and they got a long\ntail that is three fine hairs. They stick those hairs right into the\nhard bark of trees, and if you pull, the hairs stay fast and it kills\nthe bug.”\n\n“We will come at once,” laughed Elnora. “I know what they are, and I can\nuse some in my work.”\n\n“Billy, have you been crying?” inquired Mrs. Comstock.\n\nBilly lifted a chastened face. “Yes, ma'am,” he replied. “This has been\nthe worst day.”\n\n“What's the matter with the day?”\n\n“The day is all right,” admitted Billy. “I mean every single thing has\ngone wrong with me.”\n\n“Now that is too bad!” sympathized Mrs. Comstock.\n\n“Began early this morning,” said Billy. “All Snap's fault, too.”\n\n“What has poor Snap been doing?” demanded Mrs. Comstock, her eyes\nbeginning to twinkle.\n\n“Digging for woodchucks, like he always does. He gets up at two o'clock\nto dig for them. He was coming in from the woods all tired and covered\nthick with dirt. I was going to the barn with the pail of water for\nUncle Wesley to use in milking. I had to set down the pail to shut the\ngate so the chickens wouldn't get into the flower beds, and old Snap\nstuck his dirty nose into the water and began to lap it down. I knew\nUncle Wesley wouldn't use that, so I had to go 'way back to the cistern\nfor more, and it pumps awful hard. Made me mad, so I threw the water on\nSnap.”\n\n“Well, what of it?”\n\n“Nothing, if he'd stood still. But it scared him awful, and when he's\nafraid he goes a-humping for Aunt Margaret. When he got right up against\nher he stiffened out and gave a big shake. You oughter seen the nice\nblue dress she had put on to go to Onabasha!”\n\nMrs. Comstock and Philip laughed, but Elnora put her arms around the\nboy. “Oh Billy!” she cried. “That was too bad!”\n\n“She got up early and ironed that dress to wear because it was cool.\nThen, when it was all dirty, she wouldn't go, and she wanted to real\nbad.” Billy wiped his eyes. “That ain't all, either,” he added.\n\n“We'd like to know about it, Billy,” suggested Mrs. Comstock, struggling\nwith her face.\n\n“Cos she couldn't go to the city, she's most worked herself to death.\nShe's done all the dirty, hard jobs she could find. She's fixing her\ngrape juice now.”\n\n“Sure!” cried Mrs. Comstock. “When a woman is disappointed she always\nworks like a dog to gain sympathy!”\n\n“Well, Uncle Wesley and I are sympathizing all we know how, without her\nworking so. I've squeezed until I almost busted to get the juice out\nfrom the seeds and skins. That's the hard part. Now, she has to strain\nit through white flannel and seal it in bottles, and it's good for sick\nfolks. Most wish I'd get sick myself, so I could have a glass. It's so\ngood!”\n\nElnora glanced swiftly at her mother.\n\n“I worked so hard,” continued Billy, “that she said if I would throw\nthe leavings in the woods, then I could come after you to see about the\nbugs. Do you want to go?”\n\n“We will all go,” said Mrs. Comstock. “I am mightily interested in those\nbugs myself.”\n\nFrom afar commotion could be seen at the Sinton home. Wesley and\nMargaret were running around wildly and peculiar sounds filled the air.\n\n“What's the trouble?” asked Philip, hurrying to Wesley.\n\n“Cholera!” groaned Sinton. “My hogs are dying like flies.”\n\nMargaret was softly crying. “Wesley, can't I fix something hot? Can't we\ndo anything? It means several hundred dollars and our winter meat.”\n\n“I never saw stock taken so suddenly and so hard,” said Wesley. “I have\n'phoned for the veterinary to come as soon as he can get here.”\n\nAll of them hurried to the feeding pen into which the pigs seemed to be\ngathering from the woods. Among the common stock were big white beasts\nof pedigree which were Wesley's pride at county fairs. Several of\nthese rolled on their backs, pawing the air feebly and emitting little\nsqueaks. A huge Berkshire sat on his haunches, slowly shaking his head,\nthe water dropping from his eyes, until he, too, rolled over with faint\ngrunts. A pair crossing the yard on wavering legs collided, and attacked\neach other in anger, only to fall, so weak they scarcely could squeal.\nA fine snowy Plymouth Rock rooster, after several attempts, flew to the\nfence, balanced with great effort, wildly flapped his wings and started\na guttural crow, but fell sprawling among the pigs, too helpless to\nstand.\n\n“Did you ever see such a dreadful sight?” sobbed Margaret.\n\nBilly climbed on the fence, took one long look and turned an astounded\nface to Wesley.\n\n“Why them pigs is drunk!” he cried. “They act just like my pa!”\n\nWesley turned to Margaret.\n\n“Where did you put the leavings from that grape juice?” he demanded.\n\n“I sent Billy to throw it in the woods.”\n\n“Billy----” began Wesley.\n\n“Threw it just where she told me to,” cried Billy. “But some of the pigs\ncame by there coming into the pen, and some were close in the fence\ncorners.”\n\n“Did they eat it?” demanded Wesley.\n\n“They just chanked into it,” replied Billy graphically. “They pushed,\nand squealed, and fought over it. You couldn't blame 'em! It was the\nbest stuff I ever tasted!”\n\n“Margaret,” said Wesley, “run 'phone that doctor he won't be needed.\nBilly, take Elnora and Mr. Ammon to see the bugs. Katharine, suppose you\nhelp me a minute.”\n\nWesley took the clothes basket from the back porch and started in the\ndirection of the cellar. Margaret returned from the telephone.\n\n“I just caught him,” she said. “There's that much saved. Why Wesley,\nwhat are you going to do?”\n\n“You go sit on the front porch a little while,” said Wesley. “You will\nfeel better if you don't see this.”\n\n“Wesley,” cried Margaret aghast. “Some of that wine is ten years old.\nThere are days and days of hard work in it, and I couldn't say how much\nsugar. Dr. Ammon keeps people alive with it when nothing else will stay\non their stomachs.”\n\n“Let 'em die, then!” said Wesley. “You heard the boy, didn't you?”\n\n“It's a cold process. There's not a particle of fermentation about it.”\n\n“Not a particle of fermentation! Great day, Margaret! Look at those\npigs!”\n\nMargaret took a long look. “Leave me a few bottles for mince-meat,” she\nwavered.\n\n“Not a smell for any use on this earth! You heard the boy! He shan't\nsay, when he grows to manhood, that he learned to like it here!”\n\nWesley threw away the wine, Mrs. Comstock cheerfully assisting. Then\nthey walked to the woods to see and learn about the wonderful insects.\nThe day ended with a big supper at Sintons', and then they went to the\nComstock cabin for a concert. Elnora played beautifully that night. When\nthe Sintons left she kissed Billy with particular tenderness. She was\nso moved that she was kinder to Philip than she had intended to be, and\nElnora as an antidote to a disappointed lover was a decided success in\nany mood.\n\nHowever strong the attractions of Edith Carr had been, once the bond was\nfinally broken, Philip Ammon could not help realizing that Elnora was\nthe superior woman, and that he was fortunate to have escaped, when he\nregarded his ties strongest. Every day, while working with Elnora, he\nsaw more to admire. He grew very thankful that he was free to try to win\nher, and impatient to justify himself to her.\n\nElnora did not evince the slightest haste to hear what he had to say,\nbut waited the week she had set, in spite of Philip's hourly manifest\nimpatience. When she did consent to listen, Philip felt before he had\ntalked five minutes, that she was putting herself in Edith Carr's place,\nand judging him from what the other girl's standpoint would be. That was\nso disconcerting, he did not plead his cause nearly so well as he had\nhoped, for when he ceased Elnora sat in silence.\n\n“You are my judge,” he said at last. “What is your verdict?”\n\n“If I could hear her speak from her heart as I just have heard you, then\nI could decide,” answered Elnora.\n\n“She is on the ocean,” said Philip. “She went because she knew she\nwas wholly in the wrong. She had nothing to say, or she would have\nremained.”\n\n“That sounds plausible,” reasoned Elnora, “but it is pretty difficult to\nfind a woman in an affair that involves her heart with nothing at all to\nsay. I fancy if I could meet her, she would say several things. I should\nlove to hear them. If I could talk with her three minutes, I could tell\nwhat answer to make you.”\n\n“Don't you believe me, Elnora?”\n\n“Unquestioningly,” answered Elnora. “But I would believe her also. If\nonly I could meet her I soon would know.”\n\n“I don't see how that is to be accomplished,” said Philip, “but I am\nperfectly willing. There is no reason why you should not meet her,\nexcept that she probably would lose her temper and insult you.”\n\n“Not to any extent,” said Elnora calmly. “I have a tongue of my own,\nwhile I am not without some small sense of personal values.”\n\nPhilip glanced at her and began to laugh. Very different of facial\nformation and colouring, Elnora at times closely resembled her mother.\nShe joined in his laugh ruefully.\n\n“The point is this,” she said. “Some one is going to be hurt, most\ndreadfully. If the decision as to whom it shall be rests with me, I must\nknow it is the right one. Of course, no one ever hinted it to you, but\nyou are a very attractive man, Philip. You are mighty good to look at,\nand you have a trained, refined mind, that makes you most interesting.\nFor years Edith Carr has felt that you were hers. Now, how is she going\nto change? I have been thinking--thinking deep and long, Phil. If I\nwere in her place, I simply could not give you up, unless you had made\nyourself unworthy of love. Undoubtedly, you never seemed so desirable\nto her as just now, when she is told she can't have you. What I think is\nthat she will come to claim you yet.”\n\n“You overlook the fact that it is not in a woman's power to throw away\na man and pick him up at pleasure,” said Philip with some warmth. “She\npublicly and repeatedly cast me off. I accepted her decision as publicly\nas it was made. You have done all your thinking from a wrong viewpoint.\nYou seem to have an idea that it lies with you to decide what I shall\ndo, that if you say the word, I shall return to Edith. Put that thought\nout of your head! Now, and for all time to come, she is a matter of\nindifference to me. She killed all feeling in my heart for her so\ncompletely that I do not even dread meeting her.\n\n“If I hated her, or was angry with her, I could not be sure the\nfeeling would not die. As it is, she has deadened me into a creature of\nindifference. So you just revise your viewpoint a little, Elnora. Cease\nthinking it is for you to decide what I shall do, and that I will obey\nyou. I make my own decisions in reference to any woman, save you. The\nquestion you are to decide is whether I may remain here, associating\nwith you as I did last summer; but with the difference that it is\nunderstood that I am free; that it is my intention to care for you all\nI please, to make you return my feeling for you if I can. There is just\none question for you to decide, and it is not triangular. It is between\nus. May I remain? May I love you? Will you give me the chance to prove\nwhat I think of you?”\n\n“You speak very plainly,” said Elnora.\n\n“This is the time to speak plainly,” said Philip Ammon. “There is no use\nin allowing you to go on threshing out a problem which does not exist.\nIf you do not want me here, say so and I will go. Of course, I warn\nyou before I start, that I will come back. I won't yield without the\nstiffest fight it is in me to make. But drop thinking it lies in your\npower to send me back to Edith Carr. If she were the last woman in the\nworld, and I the last man, I'd jump off the planet before I would give\nher further opportunity to exercise her temper on me. Narrow this to us,\nElnora. Will you take the place she vacated? Will you take the heart she\nthrew away? I'd give my right hand and not flinch, if I could offer you\nmy life, free from any contact with hers, but that is not possible. I\ncan't undo things which are done. I can only profit by experience and\nbuild better in the future.”\n\n“I don't see how you can be sure of yourself,” said Elnora. “I don't see\nhow I could be sure of you. You loved her first, you never can care for\nme anything like that. Always I'd have to be afraid you were thinking of\nher and regretting.”\n\n“Folly!” cried Philip. “Regretting what? That I was not married to a\nwoman who was liable to rave at me any time or place, without my being\nconscious of having given offence? A man does relish that! I am likely\nto pine for more!”\n\n“You'd be thinking she'd learned a lesson. You would think it wouldn't\nhappen again.”\n\n“No, I wouldn't be 'thinking,'” said, Philip. “I'd be everlastingly\nsure! I wouldn't risk what I went through that night again, not to save\nmy life! Just you and me, Elnora. Decide for us.”\n\n“I can't!” cried Elnora. “I am afraid!”\n\n“Very well,” said Philip. “We will wait until you feel that you can.\nWait until fear vanishes. Just decide now whether you would rather have\nme go for a few months, or remain with you. Which shall it be, Elnora?”\n\n“You can never love me as you did her,” wailed Elnora.\n\n“I am happy to say I cannot,” replied he. “I've cut my matrimonial\nteeth. I'm cured of wanting to swell in society. I'm over being proud of\na woman for her looks alone. I have no further use for lavishing myself\non a beautiful, elegantly dressed creature, who thinks only of self.\nI have learned that I am a common man. I admire beauty and beautiful\nclothing quite as much as I ever did; but, first, I want an\nunderstanding, deep as the lowest recess of my soul, with the woman I\nmarry. I want to work for you, to plan for you, to build you a home with\nevery comfort, to give you all good things I can, to shield you from\nevery evil. I want to interpose my body between yours and fire, flood,\nor famine. I want to give you everything; but I hate the idea of getting\nnothing at all on which I can depend in return. Edith Carr had only\ngood looks to offer, and when anger overtook her, beauty went out like a\nsnuffed candle.\n\n“I want you to love me. I want some consideration. I even crave respect.\nI've kept myself clean. So far as I know how to be, I am honest and\nscrupulous. It wouldn't hurt me to feel that you took some interest in\nthese things. Rather fierce temptations strike a man, every few days,\nin this world. I can keep decent, for a woman who cares for decency,\nbut when I do, I'd like to have the fact recognized, by just enough of\na show of appreciation that I could see it. I am tired of this one-sided\nbusiness. After this, I want to get a little in return for what I give.\nElnora, you have love, tenderness, and honest appreciation of the finest\nin life. Take what I offer, and give what I ask.”\n\n“You do not ask much,” said Elnora.\n\n“As for not loving you as I did Edith,” continued Philip, “as I said\nbefore, I hope not! I have a newer and a better idea of loving. The\nfeeling I offer you was inspired by you. It is a Limberlost product. It\nis as much bigger, cleaner, and more wholesome than any feeling I ever\nhad for Edith Carr, as you are bigger than she, when you stand before\nyour classes and in calm dignity explain the marvels of the Almighty,\nwhile she stands on a ballroom floor, and gives way to uncontrolled\ntemper. Ye gods, Elnora, if you could look into my soul, you would see\nit leap and rejoice over my escape! Perhaps it isn't decent, but it's\nhuman; and I'm only a common human being. I'm the gladdest man alive\nthat I'm free! I would turn somersaults and yell if I dared. What an\nescape! Stop straining after Edith Carr's viewpoint and take a look from\nmine. Put yourself in my place and try to study out how I feel.\n\n“I am so happy I grow religious over it. Fifty times a day I catch\nmyself whispering, 'My soul is escaped!' As for you, take all the time\nyou want. If you prefer to be alone, I'll take the next train and stay\naway as long as I can bear it, but I'll come back. You can be most sure\nof that. Straight as your pigeons to their loft, I'll come back to you,\nElnora. Shall I go?”\n\n“Oh, what's the use to be extravagant?” murmured Elnora.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nWHEREIN PHILIP AMMON KNEELS TO ELNORA, AND STRANGERS COME TO THE\nLIMBERLOST\n\n\nThe month which followed was a reproduction of the previous June. There\nwere long moth hunts, days of specimen gathering, wonderful hours with\ngreat books, big dinners all of them helped to prepare, and perfect\nnights filled with music. Everything was as it had been, with\nthe difference that Philip was now an avowed suitor. He missed no\nopportunity to advance himself in Elnora's graces. At the end of the\nmonth he was no nearer any sort of understanding with her than he had\nbeen at the beginning. He revelled in the privilege of loving her, but\nhe got no response. Elnora believed in his love, yet she hesitated to\naccept him, because she could not forget Edith Carr.\n\nOne afternoon early in July, Philip came across the fields, through the\nComstock woods, and entered the garden. He inquired for Elnora at the\nback door and was told that she was reading under the willow. He went\naround the west end of the cabin to her. She sat on a rustic bench\nthey had made and placed beneath a drooping branch. He had not seen her\nbefore in the dress she was wearing. It was clinging mull of pale green,\ntrimmed with narrow ruffles and touched with knots of black velvet; a\nsimple dress, but vastly becoming. Every tint of her bright hair, her\nluminous eyes, her red lips, and her rose-flushed face, neck, and arms\ngrew a little more vivid with the delicate green setting.\n\nHe stopped short. She was so near, so temptingly sweet, he lost control.\nHe went to her with a half-smothered cry after that first long look,\ndropped on one knee beside her and reached an arm behind her to the\nbench back, so that he was very near. He caught her hands.\n\n“Elnora!” he cried tensely, “end it now! Say this strain is over. I\npledge you that you will be happy. You don't know! If you only would say\nthe word, you would awake to new life and great joy! Won't you promise\nme now, Elnora?”\n\nThe girl sat staring into the west woods, while strong in her eyes was\nher father's look of seeing something invisible to others. Philip's arm\nslipped from the bench around her. His fingers closed firmly over hers.\n“Elnora,” he pleaded, “you know me well enough. You have had time in\nplenty. End it now. Say you will be mine!” He gathered her closer,\npressing his face against hers, his breath on her cheek. “Can't you\nquite promise yet, my girl of the Limberlost?”\n\nElnora shook her head. Instantly he released her.\n\n“Forgive me,” he begged. “I had no intention of thrusting myself upon\nyou, but, Elnora, you are the veriest Queen of Love this afternoon. From\nthe tips of your toes to your shining crown, I worship you. I want no\nwoman save you. You are so wonderful this afternoon, I couldn't help\nurging. Forgive me. Perhaps it was something that came this morning for\nyou. I wrote Polly to send it. May we try if it fits? Will you tell me\nif you like it?”\n\nHe drew a little white velvet box from his pocket and showed her a\nsplendid emerald ring.\n\n“It may not be right,” he said. “The inside of a glove finger is not\nvery accurate for a measure, but it was the best I could do. I wrote\nPolly to get it, because she and mother are home from the East this\nweek, but next they will go on to our cottage in the north, and no\none knows what is right quite so well as Polly.” He laid the ring in\nElnora's hand. “Dearest,” he said, “don't slip that on your finger; put\nyour arms around my neck and promise me, all at once and abruptly, or\nI'll keel over and die of sheer joy.”\n\nElnora smiled.\n\n“I won't! Not all those venturesome things at once; but, Phil, I'm\nashamed to confess that ring simply fascinates me. It is the most\nbeautiful one I ever saw, and do you know that I never owned a ring of\nany kind in my life? Would you think me unwomanly if I slip it on for\na second, before I can say for sure? Phil, you know I care! I care very\nmuch! You know I will tell you the instant I feel right about it.”\n\n“Certainly you will,” agreed Philip promptly. “It is your right to take\nall the time you choose. I can't put that ring on you until it means a\nbond between us. I'll shut my eyes and you try it on, so we can see\nif it fits.” Philip turned his face toward the west woods and tightly\nclosed his eyes. It was a boyish thing to do, and it caught the\nhesitating girl in the depths of her heart as the boy element in a man\never appeals to a motherly woman. Before she quite realized what she was\ndoing, the ring slid on her finger. With both arms she caught Philip and\ndrew him to her breast, holding him closely. Her head drooped over his,\nher lips were on his hair. So an instant, then her arms dropped. He\nlifted a convulsed, white face.\n\n“Dear Lord!” he whispered. “You--you didn't mean that, Elnora! You----\nWhat made you do it?”\n\n“You--you looked so boyish!” panted Elnora. “I didn't mean it! I--I\nforgot that you were older than Billy. Look--look at the ring!”\n\n“'The Queen can do no wrong,'” quoted Philip between his set teeth. “But\ndon't you do that again, Elnora, unless you do mean it. Kings are not so\ngood as queens, and there is a limit with all men. As you say, we will\nlook at your ring. It seems very lovely to me. Suppose you leave it\non until time for me to go. Please do! I have heard of mute appeals;\nperhaps it will plead for me. I am wild for your lips this afternoon. I\nam going to take your hands.”\n\nHe caught both of them and covered them with kisses.\n\n“Elnora,” he said, “Will you be my wife?”\n\n“I must have a little more time,” she whispered. “I must be absolutely\ncertain, for when I say yes, and give myself to you, only death shall\npart us. I would not give you up. So I want a little more time--but, I\nthink I will.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Philip. “If at any time you feel that you have reached\na decision, will you tell me? Will you promise me to tell me instantly,\nor shall I keep asking you until the time comes?”\n\n“You make it difficult,” said Elnora. “But I will promise you that.\nWhenever the last doubt vanishes, I will let you know instantly--if I\ncan.”\n\n“Would it be difficult for you?” whispered Ammon.\n\n“I--I don't know,” faltered Elnora.\n\n“It seems as if I can't be man enough to put this thought aside and give\nup this afternoon,” said Philip. “I am ashamed of myself, but I can't\nhelp it. I am going to ask God to make that last doubt vanish before I\ngo this night. I am going to believe that ring will plead for me. I am\ngoing to hope that doubt will disappear suddenly. I will be watching.\nEvery second I will be watching. If it happens and you can't speak,\ngive me your hand. Just the least movement toward me, I will understand.\nWould it help you to talk this over with your mother? Shall I call her?\nShall I----?”\n\nHonk! Honk! Honk! Hart Henderson set the horn of the big automobile\ngoing as it shot from behind the trees lining the Brushwood road. The\npicture of a vine-covered cabin, a large drooping tree, a green-clad\ngirl and a man bending over her very closely flashed into view. Edith\nCarr caught her breath with a snap. Polly Ammon gave Tom Levering a\nquick touch and wickedly winked at him.\n\nSeveral days before, Edith had returned from Europe suddenly. She and\nHenderson had called at the Ammon residence saying that they were going\nto motor down to the Limberlost to see Philip a few hours, and urged\nthat Polly and Tom accompany them. Mrs. Ammon knew that her husband\nwould disapprove of the trip, but it was easy to see that Edith Carr had\ndetermined on going. So the mother thought it better to have Polly along\nto support Philip than to allow him to confront Edith unexpectedly and\nalone. Polly was full of spirit. She did not relish the thought of Edith\nas a sister. Always they had been in the same set, always Edith, because\nof greater beauty and wealth, had patronized Polly. Although it had\nrankled, she had borne it sweetly. But two days before, her father had\nextracted a promise of secrecy, given her Philip's address and told her\nto send him the finest emerald ring she could select. Polly knew how\nthat ring would be used. What she did not know was that the girl who\naccompanied her went back to the store afterward, made an excuse to the\nclerk that she had been sent to be absolutely sure that the address was\nright, and so secured it for Edith Carr.\n\nTwo days later Edith had induced Hart Henderson to take her to Onabasha.\nBy the aid of maps they located the Comstock land and passed it, merely\nto see the place. Henderson hated that trip, and implored Edith not to\ntake it, but she made no effort to conceal from him what she suffered,\nand it was more than he could endure. He pointed out that Philip had\ngone away without leaving an address, because he did not wish to see\nher, or any of them. But Edith was so sure of her power, she felt\ncertain Philip needed only to see her to succumb to her beauty as he\nalways had done, while now she was ready to plead for forgiveness. So\nthey came down the Brushwood road, and Henderson had just said to Edith\nbeside him: “This should be the Comstock land on our left.”\n\nA minute later the wood ended, while the sunlight, as always pitiless,\netched with distinctness the scene at the west end of the cabin.\nInstinctively, to save Edith, Henderson set the horn blowing. He had\nthought to drive to the city, but Polly Ammon arose crying: “Phil!\nPhil!” Tom Levering was on his feet shouting and waving, while Edith\nin her most imperial manner ordered him to turn into the lane leading\nthrough the woods beside the cabin.\n\n“Find some way for me to have a minute alone with her,” she commanded as\nhe stopped the car.\n\n“That is my sister Polly, her fiance Tom Levering, a friend of mine\nnamed Henderson, and----” began Philip,\n\n“--and Edith Carr,” volunteered Elnora.\n\n“And Edith Carr,” repeated Philip Ammon. “Elnora, be brave, for my sake.\nTheir coming can make no difference in any way. I won't let them stay\nbut a few minutes. Come with me!”\n\n“Do I seem scared?” inquired Elnora serenely. “This is why you haven't\nhad your answer. I have been waiting just six weeks for that motor. You\nmay bring them to me at the arbour.”\n\nPhilip glanced at her and broke into a laugh. She had not lost colour.\nHer self-possession was perfect. She deliberately turned and walked\ntoward the grape arbour, while he sprang over the west fence and ran to\nthe car.\n\nElnora standing in the arbour entrance made a perfect picture, framed in\ngreen leaves and tendrils. No matter how her heart ached, it was good to\nher, for it pumped steadily, and kept her cheeks and lips suffused with\ncolour. She saw Philip reach the car and gather his sister into his\narms. Past her he reached a hand to Levering, then to Edith Carr and\nHenderson. He lifted his sister to the ground, and assisted Edith to\nalight. Instantly, she stepped beside him, and Elnora's heart played its\nfirst trick.\n\nShe could see that Miss Carr was splendidly beautiful, while she moved\nwith the hauteur and grace supposed to be the prerogatives of royalty.\nAnd she had instantly taken possession of Philip. But he also had a\nbrain which was working with rapidity. He knew Elnora was watching, so\nhe turned to the others.\n\n“Give her up, Tom!” he cried. “I didn't know I wanted to see the little\nnuisance so badly, but I do. How are father and mother? Polly, didn't\nthe mater send me something?”\n\n“She did!” said Polly Ammon, stopping on the path and lifting her chin\nas a little child, while she drew away her veil.\n\nPhilip caught her in his arms and stooped for his mother's kiss.\n\n“Be good to Elnora!” he whispered.\n\n“Umhu!” assented Polly. And aloud--“Look at that ripping green and gold\nsymphony! I never saw such a beauty! Thomas Asquith Levering, you come\nstraight here and take my hand!”\n\nEdith's move to compel Philip to approach Elnora beside her had been\neasy to see; also its failure. Henderson stepped into Philip's place as\nhe turned to his sister. Instead of taking Polly's hand Levering ran to\nopen the gate. Edith passed through first, but Polly darted in front of\nher on the run, with Phil holding her arm, and swept up to Elnora. Polly\nlooked for the ring and saw it. That settled matters with her.\n\n“You lovely, lovely, darling girl!” she cried, throwing her arms\naround Elnora and kissing her. With her lips close Elnora's ear, Polly\nwhispered, “Sister! Dear, dear sister!”\n\nElnora drew back, staring at Polly in confused amazement. She was a\nbeautiful girl, her eyes were sparkling and dancing, and as she turned\nto make way for the others, she kept one of Elnora's hands in hers.\nPolly would have dropped dead in that instant if Edith Carr could have\nkilled with a look, for not until then did she realize that Polly would\neven many a slight, and that it had been a great mistake to bring her.\n\nEdith bowed low, muttered something and touched Elnora's fingers. Tom\ntook his cue from Polly.\n\n“I always follow a good example,” he said, and before any one could\ndivine his intention he kissed Elnora as he gripped her hand and cried:\n“Mighty glad to meet you! Like to meet you a dozen times a day, you\nknow!”\n\nElnora laughed and her heart pumped smoothly. They had accomplished\ntheir purpose. They had let her know they were there through compulsion,\nbut on her side. In that instant only pity was in Elnora's breast for\nthe flashing dark beauty, standing with smiling face while her heart\nmust have been filled with exceeding bitterness. Elnora stepped back\nfrom the entrance.\n\n“Come into the shade,” she urged. “You must have found it warm on these\ncountry roads. Won't you lay aside your dust-coats and have a cool\ndrink? Philip, would you ask mother to come, and bring that pitcher from\nthe spring house?”\n\nThey entered the arbour exclaiming at the dim, green coolness. There was\nplenty of room and wide seats around the sides, a table in the\ncentre, on which lay a piece of embroidery, magazines, books, the moth\napparatus, and the cyanide jar containing several specimens. Polly\nrejoiced in the cooling shade, slipped off her duster, removed her hat,\nrumpled her pretty hair and seated herself to indulge in the delightful\noccupation of paying off old scores. Tom Levering followed her example.\nEdith took a seat but refused to remove her hat and coat, while\nHenderson stood in the entrance.\n\n“There goes something with wings! Should you have that?” cried Levering.\n\nHe seized a net from the table and raced across the garden after a\nbutterfly. He caught it and came back mightily pleased with himself. As\nthe creature struggled in the net, Elnora noted a repulsed look on Edith\nCarr's face. Levering helped the situation beautifully.\n\n“Now what have I got?” he demanded. “Is it just a common one that every\none knows and you don't keep, or is it the rarest bird off the perch?”\n\n“You must have had practice, you took that so perfectly,” said Elnora.\n“I am sorry, but it is quite common and not of a kind I keep. Suppose\nall of you see how beautiful it is and then it may go nectar hunting\nagain.”\n\nShe held the butterfly where all of them could see, showed its upper and\nunder wing colours, answered Polly's questions as to what it ate,\nhow long it lived, and how it died. Then she put it into Polly's hand\nsaying: “Stand there in the light and loosen your hold slowly and\neasily.”\n\nElnora caught a brush from the table and began softly stroking the\ncreature's sides and wings. Delighted with the sensation the butterfly\nopened and closed its wings, clinging to Polly's soft little fingers,\nwhile every one cried out in surprise. Elnora laid aside the brush, and\nthe butterfly sailed away.\n\n“Why, you are a wizard! You charm them!” marvelled Levering.\n\n“I learned that from the Bird Woman,” said Elnora. “She takes soft\nbrushes and coaxes butterflies and moths into the positions she wants\nfor the illustrations of a book she is writing. I have helped her often.\nMost of the rare ones I find go to her.”\n\n“Then you don't keep all you take?” questioned Levering.\n\n“Oh, dear, no!” cried Elnora. “Not a tenth! For myself, a pair of each\nkind to use in illustrating the lectures I give in the city schools in\nthe winter, and one pair for each collection I make. One might as well\nkeep the big night moths of June, for they only live four or five\ndays anyway. For the Bird Woman, I only save rare ones she has not\nyet secured. Sometimes I think it is cruel to take such creatures from\nfreedom, even for an hour, but it is the only way to teach the masses\nof people how to distinguish the pests they should destroy, from the\nharmless ones of great beauty. Here comes mother with something cool to\ndrink.”\n\nMrs. Comstock came deliberately, talking to Philip as she approached.\nElnora gave her one searching look, but could discover only an extreme\nbrightness of eye to denote any unusual feeling. She wore one of her\nlavender dresses, while her snowy hair was high piled. She had taken\ncare of her complexion, and her face had grown fuller during the winter.\nShe might have been any one's mother with pride, and she was perfectly\nat ease.\n\nPolly instantly went to her and held up her face to be kissed. Mrs.\nComstock's eyes twinkled and she made the greeting hearty.\n\nThe drink was compounded of the juices of oranges and berries from the\ngarden. It was cool enough to frost glasses and pitcher and delicious to\ndusty tired travellers. Soon the pitcher was empty, and Elnora picked\nit up and went to refill it. While she was gone Henderson asked Philip\nabout some trouble he was having with his car. They went to the woods\nand began a minute examination to find a defect which did not exist.\nPolly and Levering were having an animated conversation with Mrs.\nComstock. Henderson saw Edith arise, follow the garden path next the\nwoods and stand waiting under the willow which Elnora would pass on her\nreturn. It was for that meeting he had made the trip. He got down on the\nground, tore up the car, worked, asked for help, and kept Philip busy\nscrewing bolts and applying the oil can. All the time Henderson kept an\neye on Edith and Elnora under the willow. But he took pains to lay the\nwork he asked Philip to do where that scene would be out of his sight.\nWhen Elnora came around the corner with the pitcher, she found herself\nfacing Edith Carr.\n\n“I want a minute with you,” said Miss Carr.\n\n“Very well,” replied Elnora, walking on.\n\n“Set the pitcher on the bench there,” commanded Edith Carr, as if\nspeaking to a servant.\n\n“I prefer not to offer my visitors a warm drink,” said Elnora. “I'll\ncome back if you really wish to speak with me.”\n\n“I came solely for that,” said Edith Carr.\n\n“It would be a pity to travel so far in this dust and heat for nothing.\nI'll only be gone a second.”\n\nElnora placed the pitcher before her mother. “Please serve this,” she\nsaid. “Miss Carr wishes to speak with me.”\n\n“Don't you pay the least attention to anything she says,” cried Polly.\n“Tom and I didn't come here because we wanted to. We only came to\ncheckmate her. I hoped I'd get the opportunity to say a word to you, and\nnow she has given it to me. I just want to tell you that she threw Phil\nover in perfectly horrid way. She hasn't any right to lay the ghost of a\nclaim to him, has she, Tom?”\n\n“Nary a claim,” said Tom Levering earnestly. “Why, even you, Polly,\ncouldn't serve me as she did Phil, and ever get me back again. If I were\nyou, Miss Comstock, I'd send my mother to talk with her and I'd stay\nhere.”\n\nTom had gauged Mrs. Comstock rightly. Polly put her arms around Elnora.\n“Let me go with you, dear,” she begged.\n\n“I promised I would speak with her alone,” said Elnora, “and she must be\nconsidered. But thank you, very much.”\n\n“How I shall love you!” exulted Polly, giving Elnora a parting hug.\n\nThe girl slowly and gravely walked back to the willow. She could not\nimagine what was coming, but she was promising herself that she would be\nvery patient and control her temper.\n\n“Will you be seated?” she asked politely.\n\nEdith Carr glanced at the bench, while a shudder shook her.\n\n“No. I prefer to stand,” she said. “Did Mr. Ammon give you the ring you\nare wearing, and do you consider yourself engaged to him?”\n\n“By what right do you ask such personal questions as those?” inquired\nElnora.\n\n“By the right of a betrothed wife. I have been promised to Philip Ammon\never since I wore short skirts. All our lives we have expected to marry.\nAn agreement of years cannot be broken in one insane moment. Always he\nhas loved me devotedly. Give me ten minutes with him and he will be mine\nfor all time.”\n\n“I seriously doubt that,” said Elnora. “But I am willing that you should\nmake the test. I will call him.”\n\n“Stop!” commanded Edith Carr. “I told you that it was you I came to\nsee.”\n\n“I remember,” said Elnora.\n\n“Mr. Ammon is my betrothed,” continued Edith Carr. “I expect to take him\nback to Chicago with me.”\n\n“You expect considerable,” murmured Elnora. “I will raise no objection\nto your taking him, if you can--but, I tell you frankly, I don't think\nit possible.”\n\n“You are so sure of yourself as that,” scoffed Edith Carr. “One hour in\nmy presence will bring back the old spell, full force. We belong to each\nother. I will not give him up.”\n\n“Then it is untrue that you twice rejected his ring, repeatedly insulted\nhim, and publicly renounced him?”\n\n“That was through you!” cried Edith Carr. “Phil and I never had been so\nnear and so happy as we were on that night. It was your clinging to him\nfor things that caused him to desert me among his guests, while he tried\nto make me await your pleasure. I realize the spell of this place, for\na summer season. I understand what you and your mother have done to\ninveigle him. I know that your hold on him is quite real. I can see just\nhow you have worked to ensnare him!”\n\n“Men would call that lying,” said Elnora calmly. “The second time I met\nPhilip Ammon he told me of his engagement to you, and I respected it.\nI did by you as I would want you to do by me. He was here parts of each\nday, almost daily last summer. The Almighty is my witness that never\nonce, by word or look, did I ever make the slightest attempt to interest\nhim in my person or personality. He wrote you frequently in my presence.\nHe forgot the violets for which he asked to send you. I gathered them\nand carried them to him. I sent him back to you in unswerving devotion,\nand the Almighty is also my witness that I could have changed his heart\nlast summer, if I had tried. I wisely left that work for you. All my\nlife I shall be glad that I lived and worked on the square. That he ever\nwould come back to me free, by your act, I never dreamed. When he left\nme I did not hope or expect to see him again,” Elnora's voice fell soft\nand low, “and, behold! You sent him--and free!”\n\n“You exult in that!” cried Edith Carr. “Let me tell you he is not free!\nWe have belonged for years. We always shall. If you cling to him, and\nhold him to rash things he has said and done, because he thought me\nstill angry and unforgiving with him, you will ruin all our lives. If\nhe married you, before a month you would read heart-hunger for me in his\neyes. He could not love me as he has done, and give me up for a little\nscene like that!”\n\n“There is a great poem,” said Elnora, “one line of which reads, 'For\neach man kills the thing he loves.' Let me tell you that a woman can\ndo that also. He did love you--that I concede. But you killed his love\neverlastingly, when you disgraced him in public. Killed it so completely\nhe does not even feel resentment toward you. To-day, he would do you a\nfavour, if he could; but love you, no! That is over!”\n\nEdith Carr stood truly regal and filled with scorn. “You are mistaken!\nNothing on earth could kill that!” she cried, and Elnora saw that the\ngirl really believed what she said.\n\n“You are very sure of yourself!” said Elnora.\n\n“I have reason to be sure,” answered Edith Carr.\n\n“We have lived and loved too long. I have had years with him to match\nagainst your days. He is mine! His work, his ambitions, his friends, his\nplace in society are with me. You may have a summer charm for a sick man\nin the country; if he tried placing you in society, he soon would see\nyou as others will. It takes birth to position, schooling, and endless\npractice to meet social demands gracefully. You would put him to shame\nin a week.”\n\n“I scarcely think I should follow your example so far,” said Elnora\ndryly. “I have a feeling for Philip that would prevent my hurting him\npurposely, either in public or private. As for managing a social career\nfor him he never mentioned that he desired such a thing. What he asked\nof me was that I should be his wife. I understood that to mean that he\ndesired me to keep him a clean house, serve him digestible food, mother\nhis children, and give him loving sympathy and tenderness.”\n\n“Shameless!” cried Edith Carr.\n\n“To which of us do you intend that adjective to apply?” inquired Elnora.\n“I never was less ashamed in all my life. Please remember I am in my own\nhome, and your presence here is not on my invitation.”\n\nMiss Carr lifted her head and struggled with her veil. She was very pale\nand trembling violently, while Elnora stood serene, a faint smile on her\nlips.\n\n“Such vulgarity!” panted Edith Carr. “How can a man like Philip endure\nit?”\n\n“Why don't you ask him?” inquired Elnora. “I can call him with one\nbreath; but, if he judged us as we stand, I should not be the one to\ntremble at his decision. Miss Carr, you have been quite plain. You have\ntold me in carefully selected words what you think of me. You insult my\nbirth, education, appearance, and home. I assure you I am legitimate.\nI will pass a test examination with you on any high school or\nsupplementary branch, or French or German. I will take a physical\nexamination beside you. I will face any social emergency you can mention\nwith you. I am acquainted with a whole world in which Philip Ammon is\nkeenly interested, that you scarcely know exists. I am not afraid to\nface any audience you can get together anywhere with my violin. I am not\nrepulsive to look at, and I have a wholesome regard for the proprieties\nand civilities of life. Philip Ammon never asked anything more of me,\nwhy should you?”\n\n“It is plain to see,” cried Edith Carr, “that you took him when he was\nhurt and angry and kept his wound wide open. Oh, what have you not done\nagainst me?”\n\n“I did not promise to marry him when an hour ago he asked me, and\noffered me this ring, because there was so much feeling in my heart for\nyou, that I knew I never could be happy, if I felt that in any way I\nhad failed in doing justice to your interests. I did slip on this ring,\nwhich he had just brought, because I never owned one, and it is very\nbeautiful, but I made him no promise, nor shall I make any, until I am\nquite, quite sure, that you fully realize he never would marry you if I\nsent him away this hour.”\n\n“You know perfectly that if your puny hold on him were broken, if he\nwere back in his home, among his friends, and where he was meeting me,\nin one short week he would be mine again, as he always has been. In your\nheart you don't believe what you say. You don't dare trust him in my\npresence. You are afraid to allow him out of your sight, because you\nknow what the results would be. Right or wrong, you have made up your\nmind to ruin him and me, and you are going to be selfish enough to do\nit. But----”\n\n“That will do!” said Elnora. “Spare me the enumeration of how I will\nregret it. I shall regret nothing. I shall not act until I know there\nwill be nothing to regret. I have decided on my course. You may return\nto your friends.”\n\n“What do you mean?” demanded Edith Carr.\n\n“That is my affair,” replied Elnora. “Only this! When your opportunity\ncomes, seize it! Any time you are in Philip Ammon's presence, exert the\ncharms of which you boast, and take him. I grant you are justified in\ndoing it if you can. I want nothing more than I want to see you\nmarry Philip if he wants you. He is just across the fence under that\nautomobile. Go spread your meshes and exert your wiles. I won't stir to\nstop you. Take him to Onabasha, and to Chicago with you. Use every art\nyou possess. If the old charm can be revived I will be the first to wish\nboth of you well. Now, I must return to my visitors. Kindly excuse me.”\n\nElnora turned and went back to the arbour. Edith Carr followed the\nfence and passed through the gate into the west woods where she asked\nHenderson about the car. As she stood near him she whispered: “Take Phil\nback to Onabasha with us.”\n\n“I say, Ammon, can't you go to the city with us and help me find a shop\nwhere I can get this pinion fixed?” asked Henderson. “We want to lunch\nand start back by five. That will get us home about midnight. Why don't\nyou bring your automobile here?”\n\n“I am a working man,” said Philip. “I have no time to be out motoring. I\ncan't see anything the matter with your car, myself; but, of course you\ndon't want to break down in the night, on strange roads, with women on\nyour hands. I'll see.”\n\nPhilip went into the arbour, where Polly took possession of his lap,\nfingered his hair, and kissed his forehead and lips.\n\n“When are you coming to the cottage, Phil?” she asked. “Come soon, and\nbring Miss Comstock for a visit. All of us will be so glad to have her.”\n\nPhilip beamed on Polly. “I'll see about that,” he said. “Sounds pretty\ngood. Elnora, Henderson is in trouble with his automobile. He wants me\nto go to Onabasha with him to show him where the doctor lives, and make\nrepairs so he can start back this evening. It will take about two hours.\nMay I go?”\n\n“Of course, you must go,” she said, laughing lightly. “You can't leave\nyour sister. Why don't you return to Chicago with them? There is plenty\nof room, and you could have a fine visit.”\n\n“I'll be back in just two hours,” said Philip. “While I am gone, you be\nthinking over what we were talking of when the folks came.”\n\n“Miss Comstock can go with us as well as not,” said Polly. “That back\nseat was made for three, and I can sit on your lap.”\n\n“Come on! Do come!” urged Philip instantly, and Tom Levering joined him,\nbut Henderson and Edith silently waited at the gate.\n\n“No, thank you,” laughed Elnora. “That would crowd you, and it's warm\nand dusty. We will say good-bye here.”\n\nShe offered her hand to all of them, and when she came to Philip she\ngave him one long steady look in the eyes, then shook hands with him\nalso.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nWHEREIN ELNORA REACHES A DECISION, AND FRECKLES AND THE ANGEL APPEAR\n\n\n“Well, she came, didn't she?” remarked Mrs. Comstock to Elnora as they\nwatched the automobile speed down the road. As it turned the Limberlost\ncorner, Philip arose and waved to them.\n\n“She hasn't got him yet, anyway,” said Mrs. Comstock, taking heart.\n“What's that on your finger, and what did she say to you?”\n\nElnora explained about the ring as she drew it off.\n\n“I have several letters to write, then I am going to change my dress and\nwalk down toward Aunt Margaret's for a little exercise. I may meet\nsome of them, and I don't want them to see this ring. You keep it until\nPhilip comes,” said Elnora. “As for what Miss Carr said to me, many\nthings, two of importance: one, that I lacked every social requirement\nnecessary for the happiness of Philip Ammon, and that if I married him I\nwould see inside a month that he was ashamed of me----”\n\n“Aw, shockins!” scorned Mrs. Comstock. “Go on!”\n\n“The other was that she has been engaged to him for years, that he\nbelongs to her, and she refuses to give him up. She said that if he were\nin her presence one hour, she would have him under a mysterious thing\nshe calls 'her spell' again; if he were where she could see him for\none week, everything would be made up. It is her opinion that he is\nsuffering from wounded pride, and that the slightest concession on her\npart will bring him to his knees before her.”\n\nMrs. Comstock giggled. “I do hope the boy isn't weak-kneed,” she said.\n“I just happened to be passing the west window this afternoon----”\n\nElnora laughed. “Nothing save actual knowledge ever would have made me\nbelieve there was a girl in all this world so infatuated with herself.\nShe speaks casually of her power over men, and boasts of 'bringing a man\nto his knees' as complacently as I would pick up a net and say: 'I am\ngoing to take a butterfly.' She honestly believes that if Philip were\nwith her a short time she could rekindle his love for her and awaken in\nhim every particle of the old devotion. Mother, the girl is honest! She\nis absolutely sincere! She so believes in herself and the strength of\nPhil's love for her, that all her life she will believe in and brood\nover that thought, unless she is taught differently. So long as she\nthinks that, she will nurse wrong ideas and pine over her blighted life.\nShe must be taught that Phil is absolutely free, and yet he will not go\nto her.”\n\n“But how on earth are you proposing to teach her that?”\n\n“The way will open.”\n\n“Lookey here, Elnora!” cried Mrs. Comstock. “That Carr girl is the\nhandsomest dark woman I ever saw. She's got to the place where she won't\nstop at anything. Her coming here proves that. I don't believe there was\na thing the matter with that automobile. I think that was a scheme she\nfixed up to get Phil where she could see him alone, as she worked to\nsee you. If you are going deliberately to put Philip under her influence\nagain, you've got to brace yourself for the possibility that she may\nwin. A man is a weak mortal, where a lovely woman is concerned, and he\nnever denied that he loved her once. You may make yourself downright\nmiserable.”\n\n“But mother, if she won, it wouldn't make me half so miserable as to\nmarry Phil myself, and then read hunger for her in his eyes! Some one\nhas got to suffer over this. If it proves to be me, I'll bear it, and\nyou'll never hear a whisper of complaint from me. I know the real Philip\nAmmon better in our months of work in the fields than she knows him in\nall her years of society engagements. So she shall have the hour she\nasked, many, many of them, enough to make her acknowledge that she is\nwrong. Now I am going to write my letters and take my walk.”\n\nElnora threw her arms around her mother and kissed her repeatedly.\n“Don't you worry about me,” she said. “I will get along all right, and\nwhatever happens, I always will be your girl and you my darling mother.”\n\nShe left two sealed notes on her desk. Then she changed her dress,\npacked a small bundle which she dropped with her hat from the window\nbeside the willow, and softly went down stairs. Mrs. Comstock was in the\ngarden. Elnora picked up the hat and bundle, hurried down the road a few\nrods, then climbed the fence and entered the woods. She took a diagonal\ncourse, and after a long walk reached a road two miles west and one\nsouth. There she straightened her clothing, put on her hat and a thin\ndark veil and waited the passing of the next trolley. She left it at the\nfirst town and took a train for Fort Wayne. She made that point just in\ntime to climb on the evening train north, as it pulled from the station.\nIt was after midnight when she left the car at Grand Rapids, and went\ninto the depot to await the coming of day.\n\nTired out, she laid her head on her bundle and fell asleep on a seat in\nthe women's waiting-room. Long after light she was awakened by the roar\nand rattle of trains. She washed, re-arranged her hair and clothing, and\nwent into the general waiting-room to find her way to the street. She\nsaw him as he entered the door. There was no mistaking the tall, lithe\nfigure, the bright hair, the lean, brown-splotched face, the steady gray\neyes. He was dressed for travelling, and carried a light overcoat and a\nbag. Straight to him Elnora went speeding.\n\n“Oh, I was just starting to find you!” she cried.\n\n“Thank you!” he said.\n\n“You are going away?” she panted.\n\n“Not if I am needed. I have a few minutes. Can you be telling me\nbriefly?”\n\n“I am the Limberlost girl to whom your wife gave the dress for\nCommencement last spring, and both of you sent lovely gifts. There is a\nreason, a very good reason, why I must be hidden for a time, and I came\nstraight to you--as if I had a right.”\n\n“You have!” answered Freckles. “Any boy or girl who ever suffered one\npang in the Limberlost has a claim to the best drop of blood in my\nheart. You needn't be telling me anything more. The Angel is at our\ncottage on Mackinac. You shall tell her and play with the babies while\nyou want shelter. This way!”\n\nThey breakfasted in a luxurious car, talked over the swamp, the work of\nthe Bird Woman; Elnora told of her nature lectures in the schools,\nand soon they were good friends. In the evening they left the train at\nMackinaw City and crossed the Straits by boat. Sheets of white moonlight\nflooded the water and paved a molten path across the breast of it\nstraight to the face of the moon.\n\nThe island lay a dark spot on the silver surface, its tall trees sharply\noutlined on the summit, and a million lights blinked around the shore.\nThe night guns boomed from the white fort and a dark sentinel paced the\nramparts above the little city tucked down close to the water. A great\ntenor summering in the north came out on the upper deck of the big\nboat, and baring his head, faced the moon and sang: “Oh, the moon shines\nbright on my old Kentucky home!” Elnora thought of the Limberlost, of\nPhilip, and her mother, and almost choked with the sobs that would arise\nin her throat. On the dock a woman of exquisite beauty swept into the\narms of Terence O'More.\n\n“Oh, Freckles!” she cried. “You've been gone a month!”\n\n“Four days, Angel, only four days by the clock,” remonstrated Freckles.\n“Where are the children?”\n\n“Asleep! Thank goodness! I'm worn to a thread. I never saw such\ninventive, active children. I can't keep track of them!”\n\n“I have brought you help,” said Freckles. “Here is the Limberlost girl\nin whom the Bird Woman is interested. Miss Comstock needs a rest before\nbeginning her school work for next year, so she came to us.”\n\n“You dear thing! How good of you!” cried the Angel. “We shall be so\nhappy to have you!”\n\nIn her room that night, in a beautiful cottage furnished with every\nluxury, Elnora lifted a tired face to the Angel.\n\n“Of course, you understand there is something back of this?” she said.\n“I must tell you.”\n\n“Yes,” agreed the Angel. “Tell me! If you get it out of your system, you\nwill stand a better chance of sleeping.”\n\nElnora stood brushing the copper-bright masses of her hair as she\ntalked. When she finished the Angel was almost hysterical.\n\n“You insane creature!” she cried. “How crazy of you to leave him to her!\nI know both of them. I have met them often. She may be able to make good\nher boast. But it is perfectly splendid of you! And, after all, really\nit is the only way. I can see that. I think it is what I should have\ndone myself, or tried to do. I don't know that I could have done it!\nWhen I think of walking away and leaving Freckles with a woman he once\nloved, to let her see if she can make him love her again, oh, it gives\nme a graveyard heart. No, I never could have done it! You are bigger\nthan I ever was. I should have turned coward, sure.”\n\n“I am a coward,” admitted Elnora. “I am soul-sick! I am afraid I shall\nlose my senses before this is over. I didn't want to come! I wanted to\nstay, to go straight into his arms, to bind myself with his ring, to\nlove him with all my heart. It wasn't my fault that I came. There was\nsomething inside that just pushed me. She is beautiful----”\n\n“I quite agree with you!”\n\n“You can imagine how fascinating she can be. She used no arts on me. Her\npurpose was to cower me. She found she could not do that, but she did a\nthing which helped her more: she proved that she was honest, perfectly\nsincere in what she thought. She believes that if she merely beckons to\nPhilip, he will go to her. So I am giving her the opportunity to learn\nfrom him what he will do. She never will believe it from any one else.\nWhen she is satisfied, I shall be also.”\n\n“But, child! Suppose she wins him back!”\n\n“That is the supposition with which I shall eat and sleep for the coming\nfew weeks. Would one dare ask for a peep at the babies before going to\nbed?”\n\n“Now, you are perfect!” announced the Angel. “I never should have liked\nyou all I can, if you had been content to go to sleep in this house\nwithout asking to see the babies. Come this way. We named the first boy\nfor his father, of course, and the girl for Aunt Alice. The next boy is\nnamed for my father, and the baby for the Bird Woman. After this we are\ngoing to branch out.”\n\nElnora began to laugh.\n\n“Oh, I suspect there will be quite a number of them,” said the Angel\nserenely. “I am told the more there are the less trouble they make. The\nbig ones take care of the little ones. We want a large family. This is\nour start.”\n\nShe entered a dark room and held aloft a candle. She went to the side of\na small white iron bed in which lay a boy of eight and another of three.\nThey were perfectly formed, rosy children, the elder a replica of his\nmother, the other very like. Then they came to a cradle where a baby\ngirl of almost two slept soundly, and made a picture.\n\n“But just see here!” said the Angel. She threw the light on a sleeping\ngirl of six. A mass of red curls swept the pillow. Line and feature the\nface was that of Freckles. Without asking, Elnora knew the colour and\nexpression of the closed eyes. The Angel handed Elnora the candle, and\nstooping, straightened the child's body. She ran her fingers through the\nbright curls, and lightly touched the aristocratic little nose.\n\n“The supply of freckles holds out in my family, you see!” she said.\n“Both of the girls will have them, and the second boy a few.”\n\nShe stood an instant longer, then bending, ran her hand caressingly down\na rosy bare leg, while she kissed the babyish red mouth. There had been\nsome reason for touching all of them, the kiss fell on the lips which\nwere like Freckles's.\n\nTo Elnora she said a tender good-night, whispering brave words of\nencouragement and making plans to fill the days to come. Then she went\naway. An hour later there was a light tap on the girl's door.\n\n“Come!” she called as she lay staring into the dark.\n\nThe Angel felt her way to the bedside, sat down and took Elnora's hands.\n\n“I just had to come back to you,” she said. “I have been telling\nFreckles, and he is almost hurting himself with laughing. I didn't think\nit was funny, but he does. He thinks it's the funniest thing that ever\nhappened. He says that to run away from Mr. Ammon, when you had made him\nno promise at all, when he wasn't sure of you, won't send him home to\nher; it will set him hunting you! He says if you had combined the\nwisdom of Solomon, Socrates, and all the remainder of the wise men, you\ncouldn't have chosen any course that would have sealed him to you so\nsurely. He feels that now Mr. Ammon will perfectly hate her for coming\ndown there and driving you away. And you went to give her the chance she\nwanted. Oh, Elnora! It is becoming funny! I see it, too!”\n\nThe Angel rocked on the bedside. Elnora faced the dark in silence.\n\n“Forgive me,” gulped the Angel. “I didn't mean to laugh. I didn't think\nit was funny, until all at once it came to me. Oh, dear! Elnora, it\n_is_ funny! I've got to laugh!”\n\n“Maybe it is,” admitted Elnora “to others; but it isn't very funny to\nme. And it won't be to Philip, or to mother.”\n\nThat was very true. Mrs. Comstock had been slightly prepared for\nstringent action of some kind, by what Elnora had said. The mother\ninstantly had guessed where the girl would go, but nothing was said\nto Philip. That would have been to invalidate Elnora's test in the\nbeginning, and Mrs. Comstock knew her child well enough to know that she\nnever would marry Philip unless she felt it right that she should. The\nonly way was to find out, and Elnora had gone to seek the information.\nThere was nothing to do but wait until she came back, and her mother\nwas not in the least uneasy but that the girl would return brave and\nself-reliant, as always.\n\nPhilip Ammon hurried back to the Limberlost, strong in the hope that now\nhe might take Elnora into his arms and receive her promise to become his\nwife. His first shock of disappointment came when he found her gone.\nIn talking with Mrs. Comstock he learned that Edith Carr had made an\nopportunity to speak with Elnora alone. He hastened down the road to\nmeet her, coming back alone, an agitated man. Then search revealed the\nnotes. His read:\n\nDEAR PHILIP:\n\nI find that I am never going to be able to answer your question of this\nafternoon fairly to all of us, when you are with me. So I am going away\na few weeks to think over matters alone. I shall not tell you, or even\nmother, where I am going, but I shall be safe, well cared for, and\nhappy. Please go back home and live among your friends, just as you\nalways have done, and on or before the first of September, I will write\nyou where I am, and what I have decided. Please do not blame Edith\nCarr for this, and do not avoid her. I hope you will call on her and be\nfriends. I think she is very sorry, and covets your friendship at least.\nUntil September, then, as ever,\n\nELNORA.\n\n\nMrs. Comstock's note was much the same. Philip was ill with\ndisappointment. In the arbour he laid his head on the table, among the\nimplements of Elnora's loved work, and gulped down dry sobs he could\nnot restrain. Mrs. Comstock never had liked him so well. Her hand\ninvoluntarily crept toward his dark head, then she drew back. Elnora\nwould not want her to do anything whatever to influence him.\n\n“What am I going to do to convince Edith Carr that I do not love her,\nand Elnora that I am hers?” he demanded.\n\n“I guess you have to figure that out yourself,” said Mrs. Comstock. “I'd\nbe glad to help you if I could, but it seems to be up to you.”\n\nPhilip sat a long time in silence. “Well, I have decided!” he said\nabruptly. “Are you perfectly sure Elnora had plenty of money and a safe\nplace to go?”\n\n“Absolutely!” answered Mrs. Comstock. “She has been taking care of\nherself ever since she was born, and she always has come out all right,\nso far; I'll stake all I'm worth on it, that she always will. I don't\nknow where she is, but I'm not going to worry about her safety.”\n\n“I can't help worrying!” cried Philip. “I can think of fifty things\nthat may happen to her when she thinks she is safe. This is distracting!\nFirst, I am going to run up to see my father. Then, I'll let you know\nwhat we have decided. Is there anything I can do for you?”\n\n“Nothing!” said Mrs. Comstock.\n\nBut the desire to do something for him was so strong with her she\nscarcely could keep her lips closed or her hands quiet. She longed to\ntell him what Edith Carr had said, how it had affected Elnora, and to\ncomfort him as she felt she could. But loyalty to the girl held her.\nIf Elnora truly felt that she could not decide until Edith Carr was\nconvinced, then Edith Carr would have to yield or triumph. It rested\nwith Philip. So Mrs. Comstock kept silent, while Philip took the night\nlimited, a bitterly disappointed man.\n\nBy noon the next day he was in his father's offices. They had a long\nconference, but did not arrive at much until the elder Ammon suggested\nsending for Polly. Anything that might have happened could be explained\nafter Polly had told of the private conference between Edith and Elnora.\n\n“Talk about lovely woman!” cried Philip Ammon. “One would think that\nafter such a dose as Edith gave me, she would be satisfied to let me go\nmy way, but no! Not caring for me enough herself to save me from public\ndisgrace, she must now pursue me to keep any other woman from loving me.\nI call that too much! I am going to see her, and I want you to go with\nme, father.”\n\n“Very well,” said Mr. Ammon, “I will go.”\n\nWhen Edith Carr came into her reception-room that afternoon, gowned for\nconquest, she expected only Philip, and him penitent. She came hurrying\ntoward him, smiling, radiant, ready to use every allurement she\npossessed, and paused in dismay when she saw his cold face and his\nfather. “Why, Phil!” she cried. “When did you come home?”\n\n“I am not at home,” answered Philip. “I merely ran up to see my father\non business, and to inquire of you what it was you said to Miss Comstock\nyesterday that caused her to disappear before I could return to the\nLimberlost.”\n\n“Miss Comstock disappear! Impossible!” cried Edith Carr. “Where could\nshe go?”\n\n“I thought perhaps you could answer that, since it was through you that\nshe went.”\n\n“Phil, I haven't the faintest idea where she is,” said the girl gently.\n\n“But you know perfectly why she went! Kindly tell me that.”\n\n“Let me see you alone, and I will.”\n\n“Here and now, or not at all.”\n\n“Phil!”\n\n“What did you say to the girl I love?”\n\nThen Edith Carr stretched out her arms.\n\n“Phil, I am the girl you love!” she cried. “All your life you have loved\nme. Surely it cannot be all gone in a few weeks of misunderstanding. I\nwas jealous of her! I did not want you to leave me an instant that night\nfor any other girl living. That was the moth I was representing. Every\none knew it! I wanted you to bring it to me. When you did not, I knew\ninstantly it had been for her that you worked last summer, she who\nsuggested my dress, she who had power to take you from me, when I wanted\nyou most. The thought drove me mad, and I said and did those insane\nthings. Phil, I beg your pardon! I ask your forgiveness. Yesterday she\nsaid that you had told her of me at once. She vowed both of you had been\ntrue to me and Phil, I couldn't look into her eyes and not see that it\nwas the truth. Oh, Phil, if you understood how I have suffered you\nwould forgive me. Phil, I never knew how much I cared for you! I will do\nanything--anything!”\n\n“Then tell me what you said to Elnora yesterday that drove her, alone\nand friendless, into the night, heaven knows where!”\n\n“You have no thought for any one save her?”\n\n“Yes,” said Philip. “I have. Because I once loved you, and believed in\nyou, my heart aches for you. I will gladly forgive anything you ask. I\nwill do anything you want, except to resume our former relations. That\nis impossible. It is hopeless and useless to ask it.”\n\n“You truly mean that!”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then find out from her what I said!”\n\n“Come, father,” said Philip, rising.\n\n“You were going to show Miss Comstock's letter to Edith!” suggested Mr.\nAmmon.\n\n“I have not the slightest interest in Miss Comstock's letter,” said\nEdith Carr.\n\n“You are not even interested in the fact that she says you are not\nresponsible for her going, and that I am to call on you and be friends\nwith you?”\n\n“That is interesting, indeed!” sneered Miss Carr.\n\nShe took the letter, read and returned it.\n\n“She has done what she could for my cause, it seems,” she said coldly.\n“How very generous of her! Do you propose calling out Pinkertons and\ninstituting a general search?”\n\n“No,” replied Philip. “I simply propose to go back to the Limberlost\nand live with her mother, until Elnora becomes convinced that I am not\ncourting you, and never shall be. Then, perhaps, she will come home to\nus. Good-bye. Good luck to you always!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nWHEREIN EDITH CARR WAGES A BATTLE, AND HART HENDERSON STANDS GUARD\n\n\nMany people looked, a few followed, when Edith Carr slowly came down\nthe main street of Mackinac, pausing here and there to note the glow of\ncolour in one small booth after another, overflowing with gay curios.\nThat street of packed white sand, winding with the curves of the shore,\noutlined with brilliant shops, and thronged with laughing, bare-headed\npeople in outing costumes was a picturesque and fascinating sight.\nThousands annually made long journeys and paid exorbitant prices to take\npart in that pageant.\n\nAs Edith Carr passed, she was the most distinguished figure of the old\nstreet. Her clinging black gown was sufficiently elaborate for a dinner\ndress. On her head was a large, wide, drooping-brimmed black hat, with\nimmense floating black plumes, while on the brim, and among the laces\non her breast glowed velvety, deep red roses. Some way these made up\nfor the lack of colour in her cheeks and lips, and while her eyes seemed\nunnaturally bright, to a close observer they appeared weary. Despite\nthe effort she made to move lightly she was very tired, and dragged her\nheavy feet with an effort.\n\nShe turned at the little street leading to the dock, and went to meet\nthe big lake steamer ploughing up the Straits from Chicago. Past the\nlanding place, on to the very end of the pier she went, then sat down,\nleaned against a dock support and closed her tired eyes. When the\nsteamer came very close she languidly watched the people lining the\nrailing. Instantly she marked one lean anxious face turned toward hers,\nand with a throb of pity she lifted a hand and waved to Hart Henderson.\nHe was the first man to leave the boat, coming to her instantly. She\nspread her trailing skirts and motioned him to sit beside her. Silently\nthey looked across the softly lapping water. At last she forced herself\nto speak to him.\n\n“Did you have a successful trip?”\n\n“I accomplished my purpose.”\n\n“You didn't lose any time getting back.”\n\n“I never do when I am coming to you.”\n\n“Do you want to go to the cottage for anything?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Then let us sit here and wait until the Petoskey steamer comes in. I\nlike to watch the boats. Sometimes I study the faces, if I am not too\ntired.”\n\n“Have you seen any new types to-day?”\n\nShe shook her head. “This has not been an easy day, Hart.”\n\n“And it's going to be worse,” said Henderson bitterly. “There's no use\nputting it off. Edith, I saw some one to-day.”\n\n“You should have seen thousands,” she said lightly.\n\n“I did. But of them all, only one will be of interest to you.”\n\n“Man or woman?”\n\n“Man.”\n\n“Where?”\n\n“Lake Shore private hospital.”\n\n“An accident?”\n\n“No. Nervous and physical breakdown.”\n\n“Phil said he was going back to the Limberlost.”\n\n“He went. He was there three weeks, but the strain broke him. He has an\nold letter in his hands that he has handled until it is ragged. He held\nit up to me and said: 'You can see for yourself that she says she will\nbe well and happy, but we can't know until we see her again, and that\nmay never be. She may have gone too near that place her father went\ndown, some of that Limberlost gang may have found her in the forest, she\nmay lie dead in some city morgue this instant, waiting for me to find\nher body.'”\n\n“Hart! For pity sake stop!”\n\n“I can't,” cried Henderson desperately. “I am forced to tell you. They\nare fighting brain fever. He did go back to the swamp and he prowled it\nnight and day. The days down there are hot now, and the nights wet with\ndew and cold. He paid no attention and forgot his food. A fever started\nand his uncle brought him home. They've never had a word from her, or\nfound a trace of her. Mrs. Comstock thought she had gone to O'Mores' at\nGreat Rapids, so when Phil broke down she telegraphed there. They had\nbeen gone all summer, so her mother is as anxious as Phil.”\n\n“The O'Mores are here,” said Edith. “I haven't seen any of them, because\nI haven't gone out much in the few days since we came, but this is their\nsummer home.”\n\n“Edith, they say at the hospital that it will take careful nursing to\nsave Phil. He is surrounded by stacks of maps and railroad guides. He\nis trying to frame up a plan to set the entire detective agency of the\ncountry to work. He says he will stay there just two days longer. The\ndoctors say he will kill himself when he goes. He is a sick man, Edith.\nHis hands are burning and shaky and his breath was hot against my face.”\n\n“Why are you telling me?” It was a cry of acute anguish.\n\n“He thinks you know where she is.”\n\n“I do not! I haven't an idea! I never dreamed she would go away when she\nhad him in her hand! I should not have done it!”\n\n“He said it was something you said to her that made her go.”\n\n“That may be, but it doesn't prove that I know where she went.”\n\nHenderson looked across the water and suffered keenly. At last he turned\nto Edith and laid a firm, strong hand over hers.\n\n“Edith,” he said, “do you realize how serious this is?”\n\n“I suppose I do.”\n\n“Do you want as fine a fellow as Philip driven any further? If he leaves\nthat hospital now, and goes out to the exposure and anxiety of a search\nfor her, there will be a tragedy that no after regrets can avert. Edith,\nwhat did you say to Miss Comstock that made her run away from Phil?”\n\nThe girl turned her face from him and sat still, but the man gripping\nher hands and waiting in agony could see that she was shaken by the\njolting of the heart in her breast.\n\n“Edith, what did you say?”\n\n“What difference can it make?”\n\n“It might furnish some clue to her action.”\n\n“It could not possibly.”\n\n“Phil thinks so. He has thought so until his brain is worn enough to\ngive way. Tell me, Edith!”\n\n“I told her Phil was mine! That if he were away from her an hour and\nback in my presence, he would be to me as he always has been.”\n\n“Edith, did you believe that?”\n\n“I would have staked my life, my soul on it!”\n\n“Do you believe it now?”\n\nThere was no answer. Henderson took her other hand and holding both of\nthem firmly he said softly: “Don't mind me, dear. I don't count! I'm\njust old Hart! You can tell me anything. Do you still believe that?”\n\nThe beautiful head barely moved in negation. Henderson gathered both\nher hands in one of his and stretched an arm across her shoulders to\nthe post to support her. She dragged her hands from him and twisted them\ntogether.\n\n“Oh, Hart!” she cried. “It isn't fair! There is a limit! I have suffered\nmy share. Can't you see? Can't you understand?”\n\n“Yes,” he panted. “Yes, my girl! Tell me just this one thing yet, and\nI'll cheerfully kill any one who annoys you further. Tell me, Edith!”\n\nThen she lifted her big, dull, pain-filled eyes to his and cried: “No! I\ndo not believe it now! I know it is not true! I killed his love for me.\nIt is dead and gone forever. Nothing will revive it! Nothing in all this\nworld. And that is not all. I did not know how to touch the depths of\nhis nature. I never developed in him those things he was made to enjoy.\nHe admired me. He was proud to be with me. He thought, and I thought,\nthat he worshipped me; but I know now that he never did care for me as\nhe cares for her. Never! I can see it! I planned to lead society, to\nmake his home a place sought for my beauty and popularity. She plans to\nadvance his political ambitions, to make him comfortable physically, to\nstimulate his intellect, to bear him a brood of red-faced children. He\nlikes her and her plans as he never did me and mine. Oh, my soul! Now,\nare you satisfied?”\n\nShe dropped back against his arm exhausted. Henderson held her and\nlearned what suffering truly means. He fanned her with his hat, rubbed\nher cold hands and murmured broken, incoherent things. By and by slow\ntears slipped from under her closed lids, but when she opened them her\neyes were dull and hard.\n\n“What a rag one is when the last secret of the soul is torn out and laid\nbare!” she cried.\n\nHenderson thrust his handkerchief into her fingers and whispered,\n“Edith, the boat has been creeping up. It's very close. Maybe some of\nour crowd are on it. Hadn't we better slip away from here before it\nlands?”\n\n“If I can walk,” she said. “Oh, I am so dead tired, Hart!\n\n“Yes, dear,” said Henderson soothingly. “Just try to pass the landing\nbefore the boat anchors. If I only dared carry you!”\n\nThey struggled through the waiting masses, but directly opposite the\nlanding there was a backward movement in the happy, laughing crowd, the\ngang-plank came down with a slam, and people began hurrying from the\nboat. Crowded against the fish house on the dock, Henderson could only\nadvance a few steps at a time. He was straining every nerve to protect\nand assist Edith. He saw no one he recognized near them, so he slipped\nhis arm across her back to help support her. He felt her stiffen against\nhim and catch her breath. At the same instant, the clearest, sweetest\nmale voice he ever had heard called: “Be careful there, little men!”\n\nHenderson sent a swift glance toward the boat. Terence O'More had\nstepped from the gang-plank, leading a little daughter, so like him, it\nwas comical. There followed a picture not easy to describe. The Angel\nin the full flower of her beauty, richly dressed, a laugh on her cameo\nface, the setting sun glinting on her gold hair, escorted by her eldest\nson, who held her hand tightly and carefully watched her steps. Next\ncame Elnora, dressed with equal richness, a trifle taller and slenderer,\nalmost the same type of colouring, but with different eyes and hair,\nfacial lines and expression. She was led by the second O'More boy who\nconvulsed the crowd by saying: “Tareful, Elnora! Don't 'oo be 'teppin'\nin de water!”\n\nPeople surged around them, purposely closing them in.\n\n“What lovely women! Who are they? It's the O'Mores. The lightest one is\nhis wife. Is that her sister? No, it is his! They say he has a title in\nEngland.”\n\nWhispers ran fast and audible. As the crowd pressed around the party\nan opening was left beside the fish sheds. Edith ran down the dock.\nHenderson sprang after her, catching her arm and assisting her to the\nstreet.\n\n“Up the shore! This way!” she panted. “Every one will go to dinner the\nfirst thing they do.”\n\nThey left the street and started around the beach, but Edith was\nbreathless from running, while the yielding sand made difficult walking.\n\n“Help me!” she cried, clinging to Henderson. He put his arm around her,\nalmost carrying her from sight into a little cove walled by high rocks\nat the back, while there was a clean floor of white sand, and logs\nwashed from the lake for seats. He found one of these with a back rest,\nand hurrying down to the water he soaked his handkerchief and carried it\nto her. She passed it across her lips, over her eyes, and then pressed\nthe palms of her hands upon it. Henderson removed the heavy hat, fanned\nher with his, and wet the handkerchief again.\n\n“Hart, what makes you?” she said wearily. “My mother doesn't care. She\nsays this is good for me. Do you think this is good for me, Hart?”\n\n“Edith, you know I would give my life if I could save you this,” he\nsaid, and could not speak further.\n\nShe leaned against him, closed her eyes and lay silent so long the man\nfell into panic.\n\n“Edith, you are not unconscious?” he whispered, touching her.\n\n“No, just resting. Please don't leave me.”\n\nHe held her carefully, gently fanning her. She was suffering almost more\nthan either of them could endure.\n\n“I wish you had your boat,” she said at last. “I want to sail with the\nwind in my face.”\n\n“There is no wind. I can bring my motor around in a few minutes.”\n\n“Then get it.”\n\n“Lie on the sand. I can 'phone from the first booth. It won't take but a\nlittle while.”\n\nEdith lay on the white sand, and Henderson covered her face with her\nhat. Then he ran to the nearest booth and talked imperatively. Presently\nhe was back bringing a hot drink that was stimulating. Shortly the\nmotor ran close to the beach and stopped. Henderson's servant brought a\nrow-boat ashore and took them to the launch. It was filled with cushions\nand wraps. Henderson made a couch and soon, warmly covered, Edith sped\nout over the water in search of peace.\n\nHour after hour the boat ran up and down the shore. The moon arose and\nthe night air grew very chilly. Henderson put on an overcoat and piled\nmore covers on Edith.\n\n“You must take me home,” she said at last. “The folks will be uneasy.”\n\nHe was compelled to take her to the cottage with the battle still\nraging. He went back early the next morning, but already she had\nwandered out over the island. Instinctively Henderson felt that the\nshore would attract her. There was something in the tumult of rough\nlittle Huron's waves that called to him. It was there he found her,\ncrouching so close the water the foam was dampening her skirts.\n\n“May I stay?” he asked.\n\n“I have been hoping you would come,” she answered. “It's bad enough when\nyou are here, but it is a little easier than bearing it alone.”\n\n“Thank God for that!” said Henderson sitting beside her. “Shall I talk\nto you?”\n\nShe shook her head. So they sat by the hour. At last she spoke: “Of\ncourse, you know there is something I have got to do, Hart!”\n\n“You have not!” cried Henderson, violently. “That's all nonsense! Give\nme just one word of permission. That is all that is required of you.”\n\n“'Required?' You grant, then, that there is something 'required?'”\n\n“One word. Nothing more.”\n\n“Did you ever know one word could be so big, so black, so desperately\nbitter? Oh, Hart!”\n\n“No.”\n\n“But you know it now, Hart!”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And still you say that it is 'required?'”\n\nHenderson suffered unspeakably. At last he said: “If you had seen\nand heard him, Edith, you, too, would feel that it is 'required.'\nRemember----”\n\n“No! No! No!” she cried. “Don't ask me to remember even the least of my\npride and folly. Let me forget!”\n\nShe sat silent for a long time.\n\n“Will you go with me?” she whispered.\n\n“Of course.”\n\nAt last she arose.\n\n“I might as well give up and have it over,” she faltered.\n\nThat was the first time in her life that Edith Carr ever had proposed to\ngive up anything she wanted.\n\n“Help me, Hart!”\n\nHenderson started around the beach assisting her all he could. Finally\nhe stopped.\n\n“Edith, there is no sense in this! You are too tired to go. You know you\ncan trust me. You wait in any of these lovely places and send me. You\nwill be safe, and I'll run. One word is all that is necessary.”\n\n“But I've got to say that word myself, Hart!”\n\n“Then write it, and let me carry it. The message is not going to prove\nwho went to the office and sent it.”\n\n“That is quite true,” she said, dropping wearily, but she made no\nmovement to take the pen and paper he offered.\n\n“Hart, you write it,” she said at last.\n\nHenderson turned away his face. He gripped the pen, while his breath\nsucked between his dry teeth.\n\n“Certainly!” he said when he could speak. “Mackinac, August 27, 1908.\nPhilip Ammon, Lake Shore Hospital, Chicago.” He paused with suspended\npen and glanced at Edith. Her white lips were working, but no sound\ncame. “Miss Comstock is with the Terence O'Mores, on Mackinac Island,”\n prompted Henderson.\n\nEdith nodded.\n\n“Signed, Henderson,” continued the big man.\n\nEdith shook her head.\n\n“Say, 'She is well and happy,' and sign, Edith Carr!” she panted.\n\n“Not on your life!” flashed Henderson.\n\n“For the love of mercy, Hart, don't make this any harder! It is the\nleast I can do, and it takes every ounce of strength in me to do it.”\n\n“Will you wait for me here?” he asked.\n\nShe nodded, and, pulling his hat lower over his eyes, Henderson ran\naround the shore. In less than an hour he was back. He helped her a\nlittle farther to where the Devil's Kitchen lay cut into the rocks; it\nfurnished places to rest, and cool water. Before long his man came with\nthe boat. From it they spread blankets on the sand for her, and made\nchafing-dish tea. She tried to refuse it, but the fragrance overcame\nher for she drank ravenously. Then Henderson cooked several dishes and\nspread an appetizing lunch. She was young, strong, and almost famished\nfor food. She was forced to eat. That made her feel much better. Then\nHenderson helped her into the boat and ran it through shady coves of\nthe shore, where there were refreshing breezes. When she fell asleep the\ngirl did not know, but the man did. Sadly in need of rest himself,\nhe ran that boat for five hours through quiet bays, away from noisy\nparties, and where the shade was cool and deep. When she awoke he took\nher home, and as they went she knew that she had been mistaken. She\nwould not die. Her heart was not even broken. She had suffered horribly;\nshe would suffer more; but eventually the pain must wear out. Into her\nhead crept a few lines of an old opera:\n\n     “Hearts do not break, they sting and ache,\n     For old love's sake, but do not die,\n     As witnesseth the living I.”\n\nThat evening they were sailing down the Straits before a stiff breeze\nand Henderson was busy with the tiller when she said to him: “Hart, I\nwant you to do something more for me.”\n\n“You have only to tell me,” he said.\n\n“Have I only to tell you, Hart?” she asked softly.\n\n“Haven't you learned that yet, Edith?”\n\n“I want you to go away.”\n\n“Very well,” he said quietly, but his face whitened visibly.\n\n“You say that as if you had been expecting it.”\n\n“I have. I knew from the beginning that when this was over you would\ndislike me for having seen you suffer. I have grown my Gethsemane in a\nfull realization of what was coming, but I could not leave you, Edith,\nso long as it seemed to me that I was serving you. Does it make any\ndifference to you where I go?”\n\n“I want you where you will be loved, and good care taken of you.”\n\n“Thank you!” said Henderson, smiling grimly. “Have you any idea where\nsuch a spot might be found?”\n\n“It should be with your sister at Los Angeles. She always has seemed\nvery fond of you.”\n\n“That is quite true,” said Henderson, his eyes brightening a little. “I\nwill go to her. When shall I start?”\n\n“At once.”\n\nHenderson began to tack for the landing, but his hands shook until\nhe scarcely could manage the boat. Edith Carr sat watching him\nindifferently, but her heart was throbbing painfully. “Why is there so\nmuch suffering in the world?” she kept whispering to herself. Inside her\ndoor Henderson took her by the shoulders almost roughly.\n\n“For how long is this, Edith, and how are you going to say good-bye to\nme?”\n\nShe raised tired, pain-filled eyes to his.\n\n“I don't know for how long it is,” she said. “It seems now as if it had\nbeen a slow eternity. I wish to my soul that God would be merciful to\nme and make something 'snap' in my heart, as there did in Phil's,\nthat would give me rest. I don't know for how long, but I'm perfectly\nshameless with you, Hart. If peace ever comes and I want you, I\nwon't wait for you to find it out yourself, I'll cable, Marconigraph,\nanything. As for how I say good-bye; any way you please, I don't care in\nthe least what happens to me.”\n\nHenderson studied her intently.\n\n“In that case, we will shake hands,” he said. “Good-bye, Edith. Don't\nforget that every hour I am thinking of you and hoping all good things\nwill come to you soon.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nWHEREIN PHILIP FINDS ELNORA, AND EDITH CARR OFFERS A YELLOW EMPEROR\n\n\n“Oh, I need my own violin,” cried Elnora. “This one may be a thousand\ntimes more expensive, and much older than mine; but it wasn't inspired\nand taught to sing by a man who knew how. It doesn't know 'beans,' as\nmother would say, about the Limberlost.”\n\nThe guests in the O'More music-room laughed appreciatively.\n\n“Why don't you write your mother to come for a visit and bring yours?”\n suggested Freckles.\n\n“I did that three days ago,” acknowledged Elnora. “I am half expecting\nher on the noon boat. That is one reason why this violin grows worse\nevery minute. There is nothing at all the matter with me.”\n\n“Splendid!” cried the Angel. “I've begged and begged her to do it. I\nknow how anxious these mothers become. When did you send? What made you?\nWhy didn't you tell me?”\n\n“'When?' Three days ago. 'What made me?' You. 'Why didn't I tell you?'\nBecause I can't be sure in the least that she will come. Mother is the\nmost individual person. She never does what every one expects she will.\nShe may not come, and I didn't want you to be disappointed.”\n\n“How did I make you?” asked the Angel.\n\n“Loving Alice. It made me realize that if you cared for your girl like\nthat, with Mr. O'More and three other children, possibly my mother, with\nno one, might like to see me. I know I want to see her, and you had told\nme to so often, I just sent for her. Oh, I do hope she comes! I want her\nto see this lovely place.”\n\n“I have been wondering what you thought of Mackinac,” said Freckles.\n\n“Oh, it is a perfect picture, all of it! I should like to hang it on\nthe wall, so I could see it whenever I wanted to; but it isn't real, of\ncourse; it's nothing but a picture.”\n\n“These people won't agree with you,” smiled Freckles.\n\n“That isn't necessary,” retorted Elnora. “They know this, and they\nlove it; but you and I are acquainted with something different. The\nLimberlost is life. Here it is a carefully kept park. You motor, sail,\nand golf, all so secure and fine. But what I like is the excitement of\nchoosing a path carefully, in the fear that the quagmire may reach out\nand suck me down; to go into the swamp naked-handed and wrest from it\ntreasures that bring me books and clothing, and I like enough of a fight\nfor things that I always remember how I got them. I even enjoy seeing a\ncanny old vulture eyeing me as if it were saying: 'Ware the sting of\nthe rattler, lest I pick your bones as I did old Limber's.' I like\nsufficient danger to put an edge on life. This is so tame. I should have\nloved it when all the homes were cabins, and watchers for the stealthy\nIndian canoes patrolled the shores. You wait until mother comes, and if\nmy violin isn't angry with me for leaving it, to-night we shall sing you\nthe Song of the Limberlost. You shall hear the big gold bees over the\nred, yellow, and purple flowers, bird song, wind talk, and the whispers\nof Sleepy Snake Creek, as it goes past you. You will know!” Elnora\nturned to Freckles.\n\nHe nodded. “Who better?” he asked. “This is secure while the children\nare so small, but when they grow larger, we are going farther north,\ninto real forest, where they can learn self-reliance and develop\nbackbone.”\n\nElnora laid away the violin. “Come along, children,” she said. “We must\nget at that backbone business at once. Let's race to the playhouse.”\n\nWith the brood at her heels Elnora ran, and for an hour lively sounds\nstole from the remaining spot of forest on the Island, which lay beside\nthe O'More cottage. Then Terry went to the playroom to bring Alice her\ndoll. He came racing back, dragging it by one leg, and crying: “There's\ncompany! Someone has come that mamma and papa are just tearing down the\nhouse over. I saw through the window.”\n\n“It could not be my mother, yet,” mused Elnora. “Her boat is not due\nuntil twelve. Terry, give Alice that doll----”\n\n“It's a man-person, and I don't know him, but my father is shaking his\nhand right straight along, and my mother is running for a hot drink and\na cushion. It's a kind of a sick person, but they are going to make him\nwell right away, any one can see that. This is the best place.\n\n“I'll go tell him to come lie on the pine needles in the sun and watch\nthe sails go by. That will fix him!”\n\n“Watch sails go by,” chanted Little Brother. “'A fix him! Elnora fix\nhim, won't you?”\n\n“I don't know about that,” answered Elnora. “What sort of person is he,\nTerry?”\n\n“A beautiful white person; but my father is going to 'colour him up,' I\nheard him say so. He's just out of the hospital, and he is a bad person,\n'cause he ran away from the doctors and made them awful angry. But\nfather and mother are going to doctor him better. I didn't know they\ncould make sick people well.”\n\n“'Ey do anyfing!” boasted Little Brother.\n\nBefore Elnora missed her, Alice, who had gone to investigate, came\nflying across the shadows and through the sunshine waving a paper. She\nthurst it into Elnora's hand.\n\n“There is a man-person--a stranger-person!” she shouted. “But he knows\nyou! He sent you that! You are to be the doctor! He said so! Oh, do\nhurry! I like him heaps!”\n\nElnora read Edith Carr's telegram to Philip Ammon and understood that he\nhad been ill, that she had been located by Edith who had notified him.\nIn so doing she had acknowledged defeat. At last Philip was free. Elnora\nlooked up with a radiant face.\n\n“I like him 'heaps' myself!” she cried. “Come on children, we will go\ntell him so.”\n\nTerry and Alice ran, but Elnora had to suit her steps to Little\nBrother, who was her loyal esquire, and would have been heartbroken over\ndesertion and insulted at being carried. He was rather dragged, but he\nwas arriving, and the emergency was great, he could see that.\n\n“She's coming!” shouted Alice.\n\n“She's going to be the doctor!” cried Terry.\n\n“She looked just like she'd seen angels when she read the letter,”\n explained Alice.\n\n“She likes you 'heaps!' She said so!” danced Terry. “Be waiting! Here\nshe is!”\n\nElnora helped Little Brother up the steps, then deserted him and came at\na rush. The stranger-person stood holding out trembling arms.\n\n“Are you sure, at last, runaway?” asked Philip Ammon.\n\n“Perfectly sure!” cried Elnora.\n\n“Will you marry me now?”\n\n“This instant! That is, any time after the noon boat comes in.”\n\n“Why such unnecessary delay?” demanded Ammon.\n\n“It is almost September,” explained Elnora. “I sent for mother three\ndays ago. We must wait until she comes, and we either have to send for\nUncle Wesley and Aunt Margaret, or go to them. I couldn't possibly be\nmarried properly without those dear people.”\n\n“We will send,” decided Ammon. “The trip will be a treat for them.\nO'More, would you get off a message at once?”\n\nEvery one met the noon boat. They went in the motor because Philip was\ntoo weak to walk so far. As soon as people could be distinguished at all\nElnora and Philip sighted an erect figure, with a head like a snowdrift.\nWhen the gang-plank fell the first person across it was a lean,\nred-haired boy of eleven, carrying a violin in one hand and an enormous\nbouquet of yellow marigolds and purple asters in the other. He was\nbeaming with broad smiles until he saw Philip. Then his expression\nchanged.\n\n“Aw, say!” he exclaimed reproachfully. “I bet you Aunt Margaret is\nright. He is going to be your beau!”\n\nElnora stooped to kiss Billy as she caught her mother.\n\n“There, there!” cried Mrs. Comstock. “Don't knock my headgear into my\neye. I'm not sure I've got either hat or hair. The wind blew like bizzem\ncoming up the river.”\n\nShe shook out her skirts, straightened her hat, and came forward to meet\nPhilip, who took her into his arms and kissed her repeatedly. Then he\npassed her along to Freckles and the Angel to whom her greetings were\nmingled with scolding and laughter over her wind-blown hair.\n\n“No doubt I'm a precious spectacle!” she said to the Angel. “I saw\nyour pa a little before I started, and he sent you a note. It's in my\nsatchel. He said he was coming up next week. What a lot of people there\nare in this world! And what on earth are all of them laughing about? Did\nnone of them ever hear of sickness, or sorrow, or death? Billy, don't\nyou go to playing Indian or chasing woodchucks until you get out of\nthose clothes. I promised Margaret I'd bring back that suit good as\nnew.”\n\nThen the O'More children came crowding to meet Elnora's mother.\n\n“Merry Christmas!” cried Mrs. Comstock, gathering them in. “Got\neverything right here but the tree, and there seems to be plenty of them\na little higher up. If this wind would stiffen just enough more to blow\naway the people, so one could see this place, I believe it would be\nright decent looking.”\n\n“See here,” whispered Elnora to Philip. “You must fix this with Billy. I\ncan't have his trip spoiled.”\n\n“Now, here is where I dust the rest of 'em!” complacently remarked\nMrs. Comstock, as she climbed into the motor car for her first ride, in\ncompany with Philip and Little Brother. “I have been the one to trudge\nthe roads and hop out of the way of these things for quite a spell.”\n\nShe sat very erect as the car rolled into the broad main avenue, where\nonly stray couples were walking. Her eyes began to twinkle and gleam.\nSuddenly she leaned forward and touched the driver on the shoulder.\n\n“Young man,” she said, “just you toot that horn suddenly and shave close\nenough a few of those people, so that I can see how I look when I leap\nfor ragweed and snake fences.”\n\nThe amazed chauffeur glanced questioningly at Philip who slightly\nnodded. A second later there was a quick “honk!” and a swerve at a\ncorner. A man engrossed in conversation grabbed the woman to whom he was\ntalking and dashed for the safety of a lawn. The woman tripped in her\nskirts, and as she fell the man caught and dragged her. Both of them\nturned red faces to the car and berated the driver. Mrs. Comstock\nlaughed in unrestrained enjoyment. Then she touched the chauffeur again.\n\n“That's enough,” she said. “It seems a mite risky.” A minute later she\nadded to Philip, “If only they had been carrying six pounds of butter\nand ten dozen eggs apiece, wouldn't that have been just perfect?”\n\nBilly had wavered between Elnora and the motor, but his loyal little\nsoul had been true to her, so the walk to the cottage began with him at\nher side. Long before they arrived the little O'Mores had crowded around\nand captured Billy, and he was giving them an expurgated version of Mrs.\nComstock's tales of Big Foot and Adam Poe, boasting that Uncle Wesley\nhad been in the camps of Me-shin-go-me-sia and knew Wa-ca-co-nah before\nhe got religion and dressed like white men; while the mighty prowess of\nSnap as a woodchuck hunter was done full justice. When they reached the\ncottage Philip took Billy aside, showed him the emerald ring and gravely\nasked his permission to marry Elnora. Billy struggled to be just, but\nit was going hard with him, when Alice, who kept close enough to hear,\nintervened.\n\n“Why don't you let them get married?” she asked. “You are much too small\nfor her. You wait for me!”\n\nBilly studied her intently. At last he turned to Ammon. “Aw, well! Go\non, then!” he said gruffly. “I'll marry Alice!”\n\nAlice reached her hand. “If you got that settled let's put on our Indian\nclothes, call the boys, and go to the playhouse.”\n\n“I haven't got any Indian clothes,” said Billy ruefully.\n\n“Yes, you have,” explained Alice. “Father bought you some coming from\nthe dock. You can put them on in the playhouse. The boys do.”\n\nBilly examined the playhouse with gleaming eyes.\n\nNever had he encountered such possibilities. He could see a hundred\namusing things to try, and he could not decide which to do first. The\nmost immediate attraction seemed to be a dead pine, held perpendicularly\nby its fellows, while its bark had decayed and fallen, leaving a bare,\nsmooth trunk.\n\n“If we just had some grease that would make the dandiest pole to play\nFourth of July with!” he shouted.\n\nThe children remembered the Fourth. It had been great fun.\n\n“Butter is grease. There is plenty in the 'frigerator,” suggested Alice,\nspeeding away.\n\nBilly caught the cold roll and began to rub it against the tree\nexcitedly.\n\n“How are you going to get it greased to the top?” inquired Terry.\n\nBilly's face lengthened. “That's so!” he said. “The thing is to begin at\nthe top and grease down. I'll show you!”\n\nBilly put the butter in his handkerchief and took the corners between\nhis teeth. He climbed the pole, greasing it as he slid down.\n\n“Now, I got to try first,” he said, “because I'm the biggest and so I\nhave the best chance; only the one that goes first hasn't hardly any\nchance at all, because he has to wipe off the grease on himself, so the\nothers can get up at last. See?”\n\n“All right!” said Terry. “You go first and then I will and then Alice.\nPhew! It's slick. He'll never get up.”\n\nBilly wrestled manfully, and when he was exhausted he boosted Terry, and\nthen both of them helped Alice, to whom they awarded a prize of her own\ndoll. As they rested Billy remembered.\n\n“Do your folks keep cows?” he asked.\n\n“No, we buy milk,” said Terry.\n\n“Gee! Then what about the butter? Maybe your ma needs it for dinner!”\n\n“No, she doesn't!” cried Alice. “There's stacks of it! I can have all\nthe butter I want.”\n\n“Well, I'm mighty glad of it!” said Billy. “I didn't just think. I'm\nafraid we've greased our clothes, too.”\n\n“That's no difference,” said Terry. “We can play what we please in these\nthings.”\n\n“Well, we ought to be all dirty, and bloody, and have feathers on us to\nbe real Indians,” said Billy.\n\nAlice tried a handful of dirt on her sleeve and it streaked beautifully.\nInstantly all of them began smearing themselves.\n\n“If we only had feathers,” lamented Billy.\n\nTerry disappeared and shortly returned from the garage with a feather\nduster. Billy fell on it with a shriek. Around each one's head he\nfirmly tied a twisted handkerchief, and stuck inside it a row of stiffly\nupstanding feathers.\n\n“Now, if we just only had some pokeberries to paint us red, we'd be\nreal, for sure enough Indians, and we could go on the warpath and fight\nall the other tribes and burn a lot of them at the stake.”\n\nAlice sidled up to him. “Would huckleberries do?” she asked softly.\n\n“Yes!” shouted Terry, wild with excitement. “Anything that's a colour.”\n\nAlice made another trip to the refrigerator. Billy crushed the berries\nin his hands and smeared and streaked all their faces liberally.\n\n“Now are we ready?” asked Alice.\n\nBilly collapsed. “I forgot the ponies! You got to ride ponies to go on\nthe warpath!”\n\n“You ain't neither!” contradicted Terry. “It's the very latest style\nto go on the warpath in a motor. Everybody does! They go everywhere in\nthem. They are much faster and better than any old ponies.”\n\nBilly gave one genuine whoop. “Can we take your motor?”\n\nTerry hesitated.\n\n“I suppose you are too little to run it?” said Billy.\n\n“I am not!” flashed Terry. “I know how to start and stop it, and I drive\nlots for Stephens. It is hard to turn over the engine when you start.”\n\n“I'll turn it,” volunteered Billy. “I'm strong as anything.”\n\n“Maybe it will start without. If Stephens has just been running it,\nsometimes it will. Come on, let's try.”\n\nBilly straightened up, lifted his chin and cried: “Houpe! Houpe! Houpe!”\n\nThe little O'Mores stared in amazement.\n\n“Why don't you come on and whoop?” demanded Billy. “Don't you know how?\nYou are great Indians! You got to whoop before you go on the warpath.\nYou ought to kill a bat, too, and see if the wind is right. But maybe\nthe engine won't run if we wait to do that. You can whoop, anyway. All\ntogether now!”\n\n\nThey did whoop, and after several efforts the cry satisfied Billy, so he\nled the way to the big motor, and took the front seat with Terry. Alice\nand Little Brother climbed into the back.\n\n“Will it go?” asked Billy, “or do we have to turn it?”\n\n“It will go,” said Terry as the machine gently slid out into the avenue\nand started under his guidance.\n\n“This is no warpath!” scoffed Billy. “We got to go a lot faster than\nthis, and we got to whoop. Alice, why don't you whoop?”\n\nAlice arose, took hold of the seat in front and whooped.\n\n“If I open the throttle, I can't squeeze the bulb to scare people out of\nour way,” said Terry. “I can't steer and squeeze, too.”\n\n“We'll whoop enough to get them out of the way. Go faster!” urged Billy.\n\nBilly also stood, lifted his chin and whooped like the wildest little\nsavage that ever came out of the West. Alice and Little Brother added\ntheir voices, and when he was not absorbed with the steering gear, Terry\njoined in.\n\n“Faster!” shouted Billy.\n\nIntoxicated with the speed and excitement, Terry threw the throttle\nwider and the big car leaped forward and sped down the avenue. In\nit four black, feather-bedecked children whooped in wild glee until\nsuddenly Terry's war cry changed to a scream of panic.\n\n“The lake is coming!”\n\n“Stop!” cried Billy. “Stop! Why don't you stop?”\n\nParalyzed with fear Terry clung to the steering gear and the car sped\nonward.\n\n“You little fool! Why don't you stop?” screamed Billy, catching Terry's\narm. “Tell me how to stop!”\n\nA bicycle shot beside them and Freckles standing on the pedals shouted:\n“Pull out the pin in that little circle at your feet!”\n\nBilly fell on his knees and tugged and the pin yielded at last. Just\nas the wheels struck the white sand the bicycle sheered close, Freckles\ncaught the lever and with one strong shove set the brake. The water\nflew as the car struck Huron, but luckily it was shallow and the beach\nsmooth. Hub deep the big motor stood quivering as Freckles climbed in\nand backed it to dry sand.\n\nThen he drew a deep breath and stared at his brood.\n\n“Terence, would you kindly be explaining?” he said at last.\n\nBilly looked at the panting little figure of Terry.\n\n“I guess I better,” he said. “We were playing Indians on the warpath,\nand we hadn't any ponies, and Terry said it was all the style to go in\nautomobiles now, so we----”\n\nFreckles's head went back, and he did some whooping himself.\n\n“I wonder if you realize how nearly you came to being four drowned\nchildren?” he said gravely, after a time.\n\n“Oh, I think I could swim enough to get most of us out,” said Billy.\n“Anyway, we need washing.”\n\n“You do indeed,” said Freckles. “I will head this procession to the\ngarage, and there we will remove the first coat.” For the remainder\nof Billy's visit the nurse, chauffeur, and every servant of the O'More\nhousehold had something of importance on their minds, and Billy's every\nstep was shadowed.\n\n“I have Billy's consent,” said Philip to Elnora, “and all the other\nconsent you have stipulated. Before you think of something more, give me\nyour left hand, please.”\n\nElnora gave it gladly, and the emerald slipped on her finger. Then they\nwent together into the forest to tell each other all about it, and talk\nit over.\n\n“Have you seen Edith?” asked Philip.\n\n“No,” answered Elnora. “But she must be here, or she may have seen me\nwhen we went to Petoskey a few days ago. Her people have a cottage over\non the bluff, but the Angel never told me until to-day. I didn't want\nto make that trip, but the folks were so anxious to entertain me, and\nit was only a few days until I intended to let you know myself where I\nwas.”\n\n“And I was going to wait just that long, and if I didn't hear then I was\ngetting ready to turn over the country. I can scarcely realize yet that\nEdith sent me that telegram.”\n\n“No wonder! It's a difficult thing to believe. I can't express how I\nfeel for her.”\n\n“Let us never speak of it again,” said Philip. “I came nearer feeling\nsorry for her last night than I have yet. I couldn't sleep on that boat\ncoming over, and I couldn't put away the thought of what sending that\nmessage cost her. I never would have believed it possible that she would\ndo it. But it is done. We will forget it.”\n\n“I scarcely think I shall,” said Elnora. “It is something I like to\nremember. How suffering must have changed her! I would give anything to\nbring her peace.”\n\n“Henderson came to see me at the hospital a few days ago. He's gone a\nrather wild pace, but if he had been held from youth by the love of a\ngood woman he might have lived differently. There are things about him\none cannot help admiring.”\n\n“I think he loves her,” said Elnora softly.\n\n“He does! He always has! He never made any secret of it. He will cut in\nnow and do his level best, but he told me that he thought she would send\nhim away. He understands her thoroughly.”\n\nEdith Carr did not understand herself. She went to her room after her\ngood-bye to Henderson, lay on her bed and tried to think why she was\nsuffering as she was.\n\n“It is all my selfishness, my unrestrained temper, my pride in my\nlooks, my ambition to be first,” she said. “That is what has caused this\ntrouble.”\n\nThen she went deeper.\n\n“How does it happen that I am so selfish, that I never controlled my\ntemper, that I thought beauty and social position the vital things of\nlife?” she muttered. “I think that goes a little past me. I think a\nmother who allows a child to grow up as I did, who educates it only for\nthe frivolities of life, has a share in that child's ending. I think\nmy mother has some responsibility in this,” Edith Carr whispered to the\nnight. “But she will recognize none. She would laugh at me if I tried\nto tell her what I have suffered and the bitter, bitter lesson I have\nlearned. No one really cares, but Hart. I've sent him away, so there is\nno one! No one!”\n\nEdith pressed her fingers across her burning eyes and lay still.\n\n“He is gone!” she whispered at last. “He would go at once. He would not\nsee me again. I should think he never would want to see me any more.\nBut I will want to see him! My soul! I want him now! I want him every\nminute! He is all I have. And I've sent him away. Oh, these dreadful\ndays to come, alone! I can't bear it. Hart! Hart!” she cried aloud. “I\nwant you! No one cares but you. No one understands but you. Oh, I want\nyou!”\n\nShe sprang from her bed and felt her way to her desk.\n\n“Get me some one at the Henderson cottage,” she said to Central, and\nwaited shivering.\n\n“They don't answer.”\n\n“They are there! You must get them. Turn on the buzzer.”\n\nAfter a time the sleepy voice of Mrs. Henderson answered.\n\n“Has Hart gone?” panted Edith Carr.\n\n“No! He came in late and began to talk about starting to California. He\nhasn't slept in weeks to amount to anything. I put him to bed. There is\ntime enough to start to California when he awakens. Edith, what are you\nplanning to do next with that boy of mine?”\n\n“Will you tell him I want to see him before he goes?”\n\n“Yes, but I won't wake him.”\n\n“I don't want you to. Just tell him in the morning.”\n\n“Very well.”\n\n“You will be sure?”\n\n“Sure!”\n\nHart was not gone. Edith fell asleep. She arose at noon the next day,\ntook a cold bath, ate her breakfast, dressed carefully, and leaving word\nthat she had gone to the forest, she walked slowly across the leaves. It\nwas cool and quiet there, so she sat where she could see him coming, and\nwaited. She was thinking deep and fast.\n\nHenderson came swiftly down the path. A long sleep, food, and Edith's\nmessage had done him good. He had dressed in new light flannels that\nwere becoming. Edith arose and went to meet him.\n\n“Let us walk in the forest,” she said.\n\nThey passed the old Catholic graveyard, and entered the deepest wood of\nthe Island, where all shadows were green, all voices of humanity ceased,\nand there was no sound save the whispering of the trees, a few bird\nnotes and squirrel rustle. There Edith seated herself on a mossy old\nlog, and Henderson studied her. He could detect a change. She was still\npale and her eyes tired, but the dull, strained look was gone. He wanted\nto hope, but he did not dare. Any other man would have forced her to\nspeak. The mighty tenderness in Henderson's heart shielded her in every\nway.\n\n“What have you thought of that you wanted yet, Edith?” he asked lightly\nas he stretched himself at her feet.\n\n“You!”\n\nHenderson lay tense and very still.\n\n“Well, I am here!”\n\n“Thank Heaven for that!”\n\nHenderson sat up suddenly, leaning toward her with questioning eyes. Not\nknowing what he dared say, afraid of the hope which found birth in his\nheart, he tried to shield her and at the same time to feel his way.\n\n“I am more thankful than I can express that you feel so,” he said. “I\nwould be of use, of comfort, to you if I knew how, Edith.”\n\n“You are my only comfort,” she said. “I tried to send you away. I\nthought I didn't want you. I thought I couldn't bear the sight of you,\nbecause of what you have seen me suffer. But I went to the root of this\nthing last night, Hart, and with self in mind, as usual, I found that I\ncould not live without you.”\n\nHenderson began breathing lightly. He was afraid to speak or move.\n\n“I faced the fact that all this is my own fault,” continued Edith, “and\ncame through my own selfishness. Then I went farther back and realized\nthat I am as I was reared. I don't want to blame my parents, but I was\ncarefully trained into what I am. If Elnora Comstock had been like me,\nPhil would have come back to me. I can see how selfish I seem to him,\nand how I appear to you, if you would admit it.”\n\n“Edith,” said Henderson desperately, “there is no use to try to deceive\nyou. You have known from the first that I found you wrong in this.\nBut it's the first time in your life I ever thought you wrong about\nanything--and it's the only time I ever shall. Understand, I think you\nthe bravest, most beautiful woman on earth, the one most worth loving.”\n\n“I'm not to be considered in the same class with her.”\n\n“I don't grant that, but if I did, you, must remember how I compare\nwith Phil. He's my superior at every point. There's no use in discussing\nthat. You wanted to see me, Edith. What did you want?”\n\n“I wanted you to not go away.”\n\n“Not at all?”\n\n“Not at all! Not ever! Not unless you take me with you, Hart.”\n\nShe slightly extended one hand to him. Henderson took that hand, kissing\nit again and again.\n\n“Anything you want, Edith,” he said brokenly. “Just as you wish it. Do\nyou want me to stay here, and go on as we have been?”\n\n“Yes, only with a difference.”\n\n“Can you tell me, Edith?”\n\n“First, I want you to know that you are the dearest thing on earth to\nme, right now. I would give up everything else, before I would you. I\ncan't honestly say that I love you with the love you deserve. My heart\nis too sore. It's too soon to know. But I love you some way. You are\nnecessary to me. You are my comfort, my shield. If you want me, as you\nknow me to be, Hart, you may consider me yours. I give you my word of\nhonour I will try to be as you would have me, just as soon as I can.”\n\nHenderson kissed her hand passionately. “Don't, Edith,” he begged.\n“Don't say those things. I can't bear it. I understand. Everything will\ncome right in time. Love like mine must bring a reward. You will love me\nsome day. I can wait. I am the most patient fellow.”\n\n“But I must say it,” cried Edith. “I--I think, Hart, that I have been on\nthe wrong road to find happiness. I planned to finish life as I started\nit with Phil; and you see how glad he was to change. He wanted the other\nsort of girl far more than he ever wanted me. And you, Hart, honest,\nnow--I'll know if you don't tell me the truth! Would you rather have a\nwife as I planned to live life with Phil, or would you rather have her\nas Elnora Comstock intends to live with him?”\n\n“Edith!” cried the man, “Edith!”\n\n“Of course, you can't say it in plain English,” said the girl. “You are\nfar too chivalrous for that. You needn't say anything. I am answered. If\nyou could have your choice you wouldn't have a society wife, either. In\nyour heart you'd like the smaller home of comfort, the furtherance\nof your ambitions, the palatable meals regularly served, and little\nchildren around you. I am sick of all we have grown up to, Hart. When\nyour hour of trouble comes, there is no comfort for you. I am tired to\ndeath. You find out what you want to do, and be, that is a man's work in\nthe world, and I will plan our home, with no thought save your comfort.\nI'll be the other kind of a girl, as fast as I can learn. I can't\ncorrect all my faults in one day, but I'll change as rapidly as I can.”\n\n“God knows, I will be different, too, Edith. You shall not be the only\ngenerous one. I will make all the rest of life worthy of you. I will\nchange, too!”\n\n“Don't you dare!” said Edith Carr, taking his head between her hands\nand holding it against her knees, while the tears slid down her cheeks.\n“Don't you dare change, you big-hearted, splendid lover! I am little and\nselfish. You are the very finest, just as you are!”\n\nHenderson was not talking then, so they sat through a long silence. At\nlast he heard Edith draw a quick breath, and lifting his head he looked\nwhere she pointed. Up a fern stalk climbed a curious looking object.\nThey watched breathlessly. By lavender feet clung a big, pursy,\nlavender-splotched, yellow body. Yellow and lavender wings began to\nexpand and take on colour. Every instant great beauty became more\napparent. It was one of those double-brooded freaks, which do occur on\nrare occasions, or merely an Eacles Imperialis moth that in the cool\ndamp northern forest had failed to emerge in June. Edith Carr drew back\nwith a long, shivering breath. Henderson caught her hands and gripped\nthem firmly. Steadily she looked the thought of her heart into his eyes.\n\n“By all the powers, you shall not!” swore the man. “You have done\nenough. I will smash that thing!”\n\n“Oh no you won't!” cried the girl, clinging to his hands. “I am not big\nenough yet, Hart, but before I leave this forest I shall have grown to\nbreadth and strength to carry that to her. She needs two of each kind.\nPhil only sent her one!”\n\n“Edith I can't bear it! That's not demanded! Let me take it!”\n\n“You may go with me. I know where the O'More cottage is. I have been\nthere often.”\n\n“I'll say you sent it!”\n\n“You may watch me deliver it!”\n\n“Phil may be there by now.”\n\n“I hope he is! I should like him to see me do one decent thing by which\nto remember me.”\n\n“I tell you that is not necessary!”\n\n“'Not necessary!'” cried the girl, her big eyes shining. “Not necessary?\nThen what on earth is the thing doing here? I just have boasted that\nI would change, that I would be like her, that I would grow bigger and\nbroader. As the words are spoken God gives me the opportunity to prove\nwhether I am sincere. This is my test, Hart! Don't you see it? If I am\nbig enough to carry that to her, you will believe that there is some\ngood in me. You will not be loving me in vain. This is an especial\nProvidence, man! Be my strength! Help me, as you always have done!”\n\nHenderson arose and shook the leaves from his clothing. He drew Edith\nCarr to her feet and carefully picked the mosses from her skirts. He\nwent to the water and moistened his handkerchief to bathe her face.\n\n“Now a dust of powder,” he said when the tears were washed away.\n\nFrom a tiny book Edith tore leaves that she passed over her face.\n\n“All gone!” cried Henderson, critically studying her. “You look almost\nhalf as lovely as you really are!”\n\nEdith Carr drew a wavering breath. She stretched one hand to him.\n\n“Hold tight, Hart!” she said. “I know they handle these things, but I\nwould quite as soon touch a snake.”\n\nHenderson clenched his teeth and held steadily. The moth had emerged\ntoo recently to be troublesome. It climbed on her fingers quietly and\nobligingly clung there without moving. So hand in hand they went down\nthe dark forest path. When they came to the avenue, the first person\nthey met paused with an ejaculation of wonder. The next stopped also,\nand every one following. They could make little progress on account of\nmarvelling, interested people. A strange excitement took possession of\nEdith. She began to feel proud of the moth.\n\n“Do you know,” she said to Henderson, “this is growing easier every\nstep. Its clinging is not disagreeable as I thought it would be. I feel\nas if I were saving it, protecting it. I am proud that we are taking it\nto be put into a collection or a book. It seems like doing a thing worth\nwhile. Oh, Hart, I wish we could work together at something for which\npeople would care as they seem to for this. Hear what they say! See them\nlift their little children to look at it!”\n\n“Edith, if you don't stop,” said Henderson, “I will take you in my arms\nhere on the avenue. You are adorable!”\n\n“Don't you dare!” laughed Edith Carr. The colour rushed to her cheeks\nand a new light leaped in her eyes.\n\n“Oh, Hart!” she cried. “Let's work! Let's do something! That's the way\nshe makes people love her so. There's the place, and thank goodness,\nthere is a crowd.”\n\n“You darling!” whispered Henderson as they passed up the walk. Her face\nwas rose-flushed with excitement and her eyes shone.\n\n“Hello, everyone!” she cried as she came on the wide veranda. “Only\nsee what we found up in the forest! We thought you might like to have it\nfor some of your collections.”\n\nShe held out the moth as she walked straight to Elnora, who arose to\nmeet her, crying: “How perfectly splendid! I don't even know how to\nbegin to thank you.”\n\nElnora took the moth. Edith shook hands with all of them and asked\nPhilip if he were improving. She said a few polite words to Freckles\nand the Angel, declined to remain on account of an engagement, and went\naway, gracefully.\n\n“Well bully for her!” said Mrs. Comstock. “She's a little thoroughbred\nafter all!”\n\n“That was a mighty big thing for her to be doing,” said Freckles in a\nhushed voice.\n\n“If you knew her as well as I do,” said Philip Ammon, “you would have a\nbetter conception of what that cost.”\n\n“It was a terror!” cried the Angel. “I never could have done it.”\n\n“'Never could have done it!'” echoed Freckles. “Why, Angel, dear, that\nis the one thing of all the world you would have done!”\n\n“I have to take care of this,” faltered Elnora, hurrying toward the door\nto hide the tears which were rolling down her cheeks.\n\n“I must help,” said Philip, disappearing also. “Elnora,” he called,\ncatching up with her, “take me where I may cry, too. Wasn't she great?”\n\n“Superb!” exclaimed Elnora. “I have no words. I feel so humbled!”\n\n“So do I,” said Philip. “I think a brave deed like that always makes one\nfeel so. Now are you happy?”\n\n“Unspeakably happy!” answered Elnora."
