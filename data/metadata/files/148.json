His\nschooling ended at ten, and at twelve he was bound apprentice to his\nbrother James, a printer, who published the \"New England Courant.\" To\nthis journal he became a contributor, and later was for a time its\nnominal editor. But the brothers quarreled, and Benjamin ran away, going\nfirst to New York, and thence to Philadelphia, where he arrived in\nOctober, 1723. He soon obtained work as a printer, but after a few\nmonths he was induced by Governor Keith to go to London, where, finding\nKeith's promises empty, he again worked as a compositor till he was\nbrought back to Philadelphia by a merchant named Denman, who gave him a\nposition in his business. On Denman's death he returned to his former\ntrade, and shortly set up a printing house of his own from which he\npublished \"The Pennsylvania Gazette,\" to which he contributed many\nessays, and which he made a medium for agitating a variety of local\nreforms. In 1732 he began to issue his famous \"Poor Richard's Almanac\"\nfor the enrichment of which he borrowed or composed those pithy\nutterances of worldly wisdom which are the basis of a large part of his\npopular reputation. In 1758, the year in which he ceased writing for the\nAlmanac, he printed in it \"Father Abraham's Sermon,\" now regarded as the\nmost famous piece of literature produced in Colonial America.\n\nMeantime Franklin was concerning himself more and more with public\naffairs. He set forth a scheme for an Academy, which was taken up later\nand finally developed into the University of Pennsylvania; and he\nfounded an \"American Philosophical Society\" for the purpose of enabling\nscientific men to communicate their discoveries to one another. He\nhimself had already begun his electrical researches, which, with other\nscientific inquiries, he carried on in the intervals of money-making and\npolitics to the end of his life. In 1748 he sold his business in order\nto get leisure for study, having now acquired comparative wealth; and in\na few years he had made discoveries that gave him a reputation with the\nlearned throughout Europe. In politics he proved very able both as an\nadministrator and as a controversialist; but his record as an\noffice-holder is stained by the use he made of his position to advance\nhis relatives. His most notable service in home politics was his reform\nof the postal system; but his fame as a statesman rests chiefly on his\nservices in connection with the relations of the Colonies with Great\nBritain, and later with France. In 1757 he was sent to England to\nprotest against the influence of the Penns in the government of the\ncolony, and for five years he remained there, striving to enlighten the\npeople and the ministry of England as to Colonial conditions. On his\nreturn to America he played an honorable part in the Paxton affair,\nthrough which he lost his seat in the Assembly; but in 1764 he was again\ndespatched to England as agent for the colony, this time to petition the\nKing to resume the government from the hands of the proprietors. In\nLondon he actively opposed the proposed Stamp Act, but lost the credit\nfor this and much of his popularity through his securing for a friend\nthe office of stamp agent in America. Even his effective work in helping\nto obtain the repeal of the act left him still a suspect; but he\ncontinued his efforts to present the case for the Colonies as the\ntroubles thickened toward the crisis of the Revolution. In 1767 he\ncrossed to France, where he was received with honor; but before his\nreturn home in 1775 he lost his position as postmaster through his share\nin divulging to Massachusetts the famous letter of Hutchinson and\nOliver. On his arrival in Philadelphia he was chosen a member of the\nContinental Congress, and in 1777 he was despatched to France as\ncommissioner for the United States. Here he remained till 1785, the\nfavorite of French society; and with such success did he conduct the\naffairs of his country that when he finally returned he received a place\nonly second to that of Washington as the champion of American\nindependence. He died on April 17, 1790.\n\nThe first five chapters of the Autobiography were composed in England in\n1771, continued in 1784-5, and again in 1788, at which date he brought\nit down to 1757. After a most extraordinary series of adventures, the\noriginal form of the manuscript was finally printed by Mr. John Bigelow,\nand is here reproduced in recognition of its value as a picture of one\nof the most notable personalities of Colonial times, and of its\nacknowledged rank as one of the great autobiographies of the world.\n\n\n\n\nBENJAMIN FRANKLIN\n\nHIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY\n\n1706-1757\n\nTwyford, at the Bishop of St. Asaph's, [1] 1771.\n\nDear Son: I have ever had pleasure in obtaining any little anecdotes of\nmy ancestors. You may remember the inquiries I made among the remains of\nmy relations when you were with me in England, and the journey I\nundertook for that purpose. Imagining it may be equally agreeable to [2]\nyou to know the circumstances of my life, many of which you are yet\nunacquainted with, and expecting the enjoyment of a week's uninterrupted\nleisure in my present country retirement, I sit down to write them for\nyou. To which I have besides some other inducements. Having emerged from\nthe poverty and obscurity in which I was born and bred, to a state of\naffluence and some degree of reputation in the world, and having gone so\nfar through life with a considerable share of felicity, the conducing\nmeans I made use of, which with the blessing of God so well succeeded,\nmy posterity may like to know, as they may find some of them suitable to\ntheir own situations, and therefore fit to be imitated.\n\n[1] The country-seat of Bishop Shipley, the good bishop, as Dr. Franklin\nused to style him.--B.\n\n[2] After the words \"agreeable to\" the words \"some of\" were interlined\nand afterward effaced.--B.\n\nThat felicity, when I reflected on it, has induced me sometimes to say,\nthat were it offered to my choice, I should have no objection to a\nrepetition of the same life from its beginning, only asking the\nadvantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faults of\nthe first. So I might, besides correcting the faults, change some\nsinister accidents and events of it for others more favorable. But\nthough this were denied, I should still accept the offer. Since such a\nrepetition is not to be expected, the next thing most like living one's\nlife over again seems to be a recollection of that life, and to make\nthat recollection as durable as possible by putting it down in writing.\n\nHereby, too, I shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men, to\nbe talking of themselves and their own past actions; and I shall indulge\nit without being tiresome to others, who, through respect to age, might\nconceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing, since this may be read\nor not as any one pleases. And, lastly (I may as well confess it, since\nmy denial of it will be believed by nobody), perhaps I shall a good deal\ngratify my own vanity. Indeed, I scarce ever heard or saw the\nintroductory words, \"Without vanity I may say,\" &c., but some vain thing\nimmediately followed. Most people dislike vanity in others, whatever\nshare they have of it themselves; but I give it fair quarter wherever I\nmeet with it, being persuaded that it is often productive of good to the\npossessor, and to others that are within his sphere of action; and\ntherefore, in many cases, it would not be altogether absurd if a man\nwere to thank God for his vanity among the other comforts of life.\n\nAnd now I speak of thanking God, I desire with all humility to\nacknowledge that I owe the mentioned happiness of my past life to His\nkind providence, which lead me to the means I used and gave them\nsuccess. My belief of this induces me to hope, though I must not\npresume, that the same goodness will still be exercised toward me, in\ncontinuing that happiness, or enabling me to bear a fatal reverse, which\nI may experience as others have done: the complexion of my future\nfortune being known to Him only in whose power it is to bless to us even\nour afflictions.\n\nThe notes one of my uncles (who had the same kind of curiosity in\ncollecting family anecdotes) once put into my hands, furnished me with\nseveral particulars relating to our ancestors. From these notes I\nlearned that the family had lived in the same village, Ecton, in\nNorthamptonshire, for three hundred years, and how much longer he knew\nnot (perhaps from the time when the name of Franklin, that before was\nthe name of an order of people, was assumed by them as a surname when\nothers took surnames all over the kingdom), on a freehold of about\nthirty acres, aided by the smith's business, which had continued in the\nfamily till his time, the eldest son being always bred to that business;\na custom which he and my father followed as to their eldest sons. When I\nsearched the registers at Ecton, I found an account of their births,\nmarriages and burials from the year 1555 only, there being no registers\nkept in that parish at any time preceding. By that register I perceived\nthat I was the youngest son of the youngest son for five generations\nback. My grandfather Thomas, who was born in 1598, lived at Ecton till\nhe grew too old to follow business longer, when he went to live with his\nson John, a dyer at Banbury, in Oxfordshire, with whom my father served\nan apprenticeship. There my grandfather died and lies buried. We saw his\ngravestone in 1758. His eldest son Thomas lived in the house at Ecton,\nand left it with the land to his only child, a daughter, who, with her\nhusband, one Fisher, of Wellingborough, sold it to Mr. Isted, now lord\nof the manor there. My grandfather had four sons that grew up, viz.:\nThomas, John, Benjamin and Josiah. I will give you what account I can of\nthem, at this distance from my papers, and if these are not lost in my\nabsence, you will among them find many more particulars.\n\nThomas was bred a smith under his father; but, being ingenious, and\nencouraged in learning (as all my brothers were) by an Esquire Palmer,\nthen the principal gentleman in that parish, he qualified himself for\nthe business of scrivener; became a considerable man in the county; was\na chief mover of all public-spirited undertakings for the county or town\nof Northampton, and his own village, of which many instances were\nrelated of him; and much taken notice of and patronized by the then Lord\nHalifax. He died in 1702, January 6, old style, just four years to a day\nbefore I was born. The account we received of his life and character\nfrom some old people at Ecton, I remember, struck you as something\nextraordinary, from its similarity to what you knew of mine. \"Had he\ndied on the same day,\" you said, \"one might have supposed a\ntransmigration.\"\n\nJohn was bred a dyer, I believe of woolens. Benjamin was bred a silk\ndyer, serving an apprenticeship at London. He was an ingenious man. I\nremember him well, for when I was a boy he came over to my father in\nBoston, and lived in the house with us some years. He lived to a great\nage. His grandson, Samuel Franklin, now lives in Boston. He left behind\nhim two quarto volumes, MS., of his own poetry, consisting of little\noccasional pieces addressed to his friends and relations, of which the\nfollowing, sent to me, is a specimen. ¹ He had formed a short-hand of\nhis own, which he taught me, but, never practising it, I have now forgot\nit. I was named after this uncle, there being a particular affection\nbetween him and my father. He was very pious, a great attender of\nsermons of the best preachers, which he took down in his short-hand, and\nhad with him many volumes of them. He was also much of a politician; too\nmuch, perhaps, for his station. There fell lately into my hands, in\nLondon, a collection he had made of all the principal pamphlets,\nrelating to public affairs, from 1641 to 1717; many of the volumes are\nwanting as appears by the numbering, but there still remain eight\nvolumes in folio, and twenty-four in quarto and in octavo. A dealer in\nold books met with them, and knowing me by my sometimes buying of him,\nhe brought them to me. It seems my uncle must have left them here, when\nhe went to America, which was about fifty years since. There are many of\nhis notes in the margins.\n\n¹ Here follow in the margin the words, in brackets, \"here insert it,\"\nbut the poetry is not given. Mr. Sparks informs us (Life of Franklin,\np. 6) that these volumes had been preserved, and were in possession of\nMrs. Emmons, of Boston, great-grandmother of their author.\n\nThis obscure family of ours was early in the Reformation, and continued\nProtestants through the reign of Queen Mary, when they were sometimes in\ndanger of trouble on account of their zeal against popery. They had got\nan English Bible, and to conceal and secure it, it was fastened open\nwith tapes under and within the cover of a joint-stool. When my\ngreat-great-grandfather read it to his family, he turned up the\njoint-stool upon his knees, turning over the leaves then under the\ntapes. One of the children stood at the door to give notice if he saw\nthe apparitor coming, who was an officer of the spiritual court. In that\ncase the stool was turned down again upon its feet, when the Bible\nremained concealed under it as before. This anecdote I had from my uncle\nBenjamin. The family continued all of the Church of England till about\nthe end of Charles the Second's reign, when some of the ministers that\nhad been outed for nonconformity holding conventicles in\nNorthamptonshire, Benjamin and Josiah adhered to them, and so continued\nall their lives: the rest of the family remained with the Episcopal\nChurch.\n\nJosiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife with three\nchildren into New England, about 1682. The conventicles having been\nforbidden by law, and frequently disturbed, induced some considerable\nmen of his acquaintance to remove to that country, and he was prevailed\nwith to accompany them thither, where they expected to enjoy their mode\nof religion with freedom. By the same wife he had four children more\nborn there, and by a second wife ten more, in all seventeen; of which I\nremember thirteen sitting at one time at his table, who all grew up to\nbe men and women, and married; I was the youngest son, and the youngest\nchild but two, and was born in Boston, New England. My mother, the\nsecond wife, was Abiah Folger, daughter of Peter Folger, one of the\nfirst settlers of New England, of whom honorable mention is made by\nCotton Mather, in his church history of that country, entitled Magnalia\nChristi Americana, as \"a godly, learned Englishman,\" if I remember the\nwords rightly. I have heard that he wrote sundry small occasional\npieces, but only one of them was printed, which I saw now many years\nsince. It was written in 1675, in the home-spun verse of that time and\npeople, and addressed to those then concerned in the government there.\nIt was in favor of liberty of conscience, and in behalf of the Baptists,\nQuakers, and other sectaries that had been under persecution, ascribing\nthe Indian wars, and other distresses that had befallen the country, to\nthat persecution, as so many judgments of God to punish so heinous an\noffense, and exhorting a repeal of those uncharitable laws. The whole\nappeared to me as written with a good deal of decent plainness and manly\nfreedom. The six concluding lines I remember, though I have forgotten\nthe two first of the stanza; but the purport of them was, that his\ncensures proceeded from good-will, and, therefore, he would be known to\nbe the author.\n\n   \"Because to be a libeller (says he)\n       I hate it with my heart;\n    From Sherburne town, where now I dwell\n       My name I do put here;\n    Without offense your real friend,\n       It is Peter Folgier.\"\n\nMy elder brothers were all put apprentices to different trades. I was\nput to the grammar-school at eight years of age, my father intending to\ndevote me, as the tithe of his sons, to the service of the Church. My\nearly readiness in learning to read (which must have been very early, as\nI do not remember when I could not read), and the opinion of all his\nfriends, that I should certainly make a good scholar, encouraged him in\nthis purpose of his. My uncle Benjamin, too, approved of it, and\nproposed to give me all his short-hand volumes of sermons, I suppose as\na stock to set up with, if I would learn his character. I continued,\nhowever, at the grammar-school not quite one year, though in that time I\nhad risen gradually from the middle of the class of that year to be the\nhead of it, and farther was removed into the next class above it, in\norder to go with that into the third at the end of the year. But my\nfather, in the meantime, from a view of the expense of a college\neducation, which having so large a family he could not well afford, and\nthe mean living many so educated were afterwards able to obtain--reasons\nthat he gave to his friends in my hearing--altered his first intention,\ntook me from the grammar-school, and sent me to a school for writing and\narithmetic, kept by a then famous man, Mr. George Brownell, very\nsuccessful in his profession generally, and that by mild, encouraging\nmethods. Under him I acquired fair writing pretty soon, but I failed in\nthe arithmetic, and made no progress in it. At ten years old I was taken\nhome to assist my father in his business, which was that of a\ntallow-chandler and sope-boiler; a business he was not bred to, but had\nassumed on his arrival in New England, and on finding his dying trade\nwould not maintain his family, being in little request. Accordingly, I\nwas employed in cutting wick for the candles, filling the dipping mold\nand the molds for cast candles, attending the shop, going of errands,\netc.\n\nI disliked the trade, and had a strong inclination for the sea, but my\nfather declared against it; however, living near the water, I was much\nin and about it, learnt early to swim well, and to manage boats; and\nwhen in a boat or canoe with other boys, I was commonly allowed to\ngovern, especially in any case of difficulty; and upon other occasions I\nwas generally a leader among the boys, and sometimes led them into\nscrapes, of which I will mention one instance, as it shows an early\nprojecting public spirit, tho' not then justly conducted.\n\nThere was a salt-marsh that bounded part of the mill-pond, on the edge\nof which, at high water, we used to stand to fish for minnows. By much\ntrampling, we had made it a mere quagmire. My proposal was to build a\nwharff there fit for us to stand upon, and I showed my comrades a large\nheap of stones, which were intended for a new house near the marsh, and\nwhich would very well suit our purpose. Accordingly, in the evening,\nwhen the workmen were gone, I assembled a number of my play-fellows, and\nworking with them diligently like so many emmets, sometimes two or three\nto a stone, we brought them all away and built our little wharff. The\nnext morning the workmen were surprised at missing the stones, which\nwere found in our wharff. Inquiry was made after the removers; we were\ndiscovered and complained of; several of us were corrected by our\nfathers; and though I pleaded the usefulness of the work, mine convinced\nme that nothing was useful which was not honest.\n\nI think you may like to know something of his person and character. He\nhad an excellent constitution of body, was of middle stature, but well\nset, and very strong; he was ingenious, could draw prettily, was skilled\na little in music, and had a clear pleasing voice, so that when he\nplayed psalm tunes on his violin and sung withal, as he sometimes did in\nan evening after the business of the day was over, it was extremely\nagreeable to hear. He had a mechanical genius too, and, on occasion, was\nvery handy in the use of other tradesmen's tools; but his great\nexcellence lay in a sound understanding and solid judgment in prudential\nmatters, both in private and publick affairs. In the latter, indeed, he\nwas never employed, the numerous family he had to educate and the\nstraitness of his circumstances keeping him close to his trade; but I\nremember well his being frequently visited by leading people, who\nconsulted him for his opinion in affairs of the town or of the church he\nbelonged to, and showed a good deal of respect for his judgment and\nadvice: he was also much consulted by private persons about their\naffairs when any difficulty occurred, and frequently chosen an\narbitrator between contending parties.\n\nAt his table he liked to have, as often as he could, some sensible\nfriend or neighbor to converse with, and always took care to start some\ningenious or useful topic for discourse, which might tend to improve the\nminds of his children. By this means he turned our attention to what was\ngood, just, and prudent in the conduct of life; and little or no notice\nwas ever taken of what related to the victuals on the table, whether it\nwas well or ill dressed, in or out of season, of good or bad flavor,\npreferable or inferior to this or that other thing of the kind, so that\nI was bro't up in such a perfect inattention to those matters as to be\nquite indifferent what kind of food was set before me, and so\nunobservant of it, that to this day if I am asked I can scarce tell a\nfew hours after dinner what I dined upon. This has been a convenience to\nme in travelling, where my companions have been sometimes very unhappy\nfor want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate, because\nbetter instructed, tastes and appetites.\n\nMy mother had likewise an excellent constitution: she suckled all her\nten children. I never knew either my father or mother to have any\nsickness but that of which they dy'd, he at 89, and she at 85 years of\nage. They lie buried together at Boston, where I some years since placed\na marble over their grave, with this inscription:\n\nJosiah Franklin,\nand\nAbiah his wife,\nlie here interred.\nThey lived lovingly together in wedlock\nfifty-five years.\nWithout an estate, or any gainful employment,\nBy constant labor and industry,\nwith God's blessing,\nThey maintained a large family\ncomfortably,\nand brought up thirteen children\nand seven grandchildren\nreputably.\nFrom this instance, reader,\nBe encouraged to diligence in thy calling,\nAnd distrust not Providence.\nHe was a pious and prudent man;\nShe, a discreet and virtuous woman.\nTheir youngest son,\nIn filial regard to their memory,\nPlaces this stone.\nJ.F. born 1655, died 1744, Ætat 89.\nA.F. born 1667, died 1752, ------85.\n\nBy my rambling digressions I perceive myself to be grown old. I us'd to\nwrite more methodically. But one does not dress for private company as\nfor a publick ball. 'Tis perhaps only negligence.\n\nTo return: I continued thus employed in my father's business for two\nyears, that is, till I was twelve years old; and my brother John, who\nwas bred to that business, having left my father, married, and set up\nfor himself at Rhode Island, there was all appearance that I was\ndestined to supply his place, and become a tallow-chandler. But my\ndislike to the trade continuing, my father was under apprehensions that\nif he did not find one for me more agreeable, I should break away and\nget to sea, as his son Josiah had done, to his great vexation. He\ntherefore sometimes took me to walk with him, and see joiners,\nbricklayers, turners, braziers, etc., at their work, that he might\nobserve my inclination, and endeavor to fix it on some trade or other on\nland. It has ever since been a pleasure to me to see good workmen handle\ntheir tools; and it has been useful to me, having learnt so much by it\nas to be able to do little jobs myself in my house when a workman could\nnot readily be got, and to construct little machines for my experiments,\nwhile the intention of making the experiment was fresh and warm in my\nmind. My father at last fixed upon the cutler's trade, and my uncle\nBenjamin's son Samuel, who was bred to that business in London, being\nabout that time established in Boston, I was sent to be with him some\ntime on liking. But his expectations of a fee with me displeasing my\nfather, I was taken home again.\n\nFrom a child I was fond of reading, and all the little money that came\ninto my hands was ever laid out in books. Pleased with the Pilgrim's\nProgress, my first collection was of John Bunyan's works in separate\nlittle volumes. I afterward sold them to enable me to buy R. Burton's\nHistorical Collections; they were small chapmen's books, and cheap, 40\nor 50 in all. My father's little library consisted chiefly of books in\npolemic divinity, most of which I read, and have since often regretted\nthat, at a time when I had such a thirst for knowledge, more proper\nbooks had not fallen in my way since it was now resolved I should not be\na clergyman. Plutarch's Lives there was in which I read abundantly, and\nI still think that time spent to great advantage. There was also a book\nof De Foe's, called an Essay on Projects, and another of Dr. Mather's,\ncalled Essays to do Good, which perhaps gave me a turn of thinking that\nhad an influence on some of the principal future events of my life.\n\nThis bookish inclination at length determined my father to make me a\nprinter, though he had already one son (James) of that profession. In\n1717 my brother James returned from England with a press and letters to\nset up his business in Boston. I liked it much better than that of my\nfather, but still had a hankering for the sea. To prevent the\napprehended effect of such an inclination, my father was impatient to\nhave me bound to my brother. I stood out some time, but at last was\npersuaded, and signed the indentures when I was yet but twelve years\nold. I was to serve as an apprentice till I was twenty-one years of age,\nonly I was to be allowed journeyman's wages during the last year. In a\nlittle time I made great proficiency in the business, and became a\nuseful hand to my brother. I now had access to better books. An\nacquaintance with the apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimes to\nborrow a small one, which I was careful to return soon and clean. Often\nI sat up in my room reading the greatest part of the night, when the\nbook was borrowed in the evening and to be returned early in the\nmorning, lest it should be missed or wanted.\n\nAnd after some time an ingenious tradesman, Mr. Matthew Adams, who had a\npretty collection of books, and who frequented our printing-house, took\nnotice of me, invited me to his library, and very kindly lent me such\nbooks as I chose to read. I now took a fancy to poetry, and made some\nlittle pieces; my brother, thinking it might turn to account, encouraged\nme, and put me on composing occasional ballads. One was called The\nLighthouse Tragedy, and contained an account of the drowning of Captain\nWorthilake, with his two daughters: the other was a sailor's song, on\nthe taking of Teach (or Blackbeard) the pirate. They were wretched\nstuff, in the Grub-street-ballad style; and when they were printed he\nsent me about the town to sell them. The first sold wonderfully, the\nevent being recent, having made a great noise. This flattered my vanity;\nbut my father discouraged me by ridiculing my performances, and telling\nme verse-makers were generally beggars. So I escaped being a poet, most\nprobably a very bad one; but as prose writing had been of great use to\nme in the course of my life, and was a principal means of my\nadvancement, I shall tell you how, in such a situation, I acquired what\nlittle ability I have in that way.\n\nThere was another bookish lad in the town, John Collins by name, with\nwhom I was intimately acquainted. We sometimes disputed, and very fond\nwe were of argument, and very desirous of confuting one another, which\ndisputatious turn, by the way, is apt to become a very bad habit, making\npeople often extremely disagreeable in company by the contradiction that\nis necessary to bring it into practice; and thence, besides souring and\nspoiling the conversation, is productive of disgusts and, perhaps\nenmities where you may have occasion for friendship. I had caught it by\nreading my father's books of dispute about religion. Persons of good\nsense, I have since observed, seldom fall into it, except lawyers,\nuniversity men, and men of all sorts that have been bred at Edinborough.\n\nA question was once, somehow or other, started between Collins and me,\nof the propriety of educating the female sex in learning, and their\nabilities for study. He was of opinion that it was improper, and that\nthey were naturally unequal to it. I took the contrary side, perhaps a\nlittle for dispute's sake. He was naturally more eloquent, had a ready\nplenty of words; and sometimes, as I thought, bore me down more by his\nfluency than by the strength of his reasons. As we parted without\nsettling the point, and were not to see one another again for some time,\nI sat down to put my arguments in writing, which I copied fair and sent\nto him. He answered, and I replied. Three or four letters of a side had\npassed, when my father happened to find my papers and read them. Without\nentering into the discussion, he took occasion to talk to me about the\nmanner of my writing; observed that, though I had the advantage of my\nantagonist in correct spelling and pointing (which I ow'd to the\nprinting-house), I fell far short in elegance of expression, in method\nand in perspicuity, of which he convinced me by several instances. I saw\nthe justice of his remark, and thence grew more attentive to the manner\nin writing, and determined to endeavor at improvement.\n\nAbout this time I met with an odd volume of the Spectator. It was the\nthird. I had never before seen any of them. I bought it, read it over\nand over, and was much delighted with it. I thought the writing\nexcellent, and wished, if possible, to imitate it. With this view I took\nsome of the papers, and, making short hints of the sentiment in each\nsentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the\nbook, try'd to compleat the papers again, by expressing each hinted\nsentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in\nany suitable words that should come to hand. Then I compared my\nSpectator with the original, discovered some of my faults, and corrected\nthem. But I found I wanted a stock of words, or a readiness in\nrecollecting and using them, which I thought I should have acquired\nbefore that time if I had gone on making verses; since the continual\noccasion for words of the same import, but of different length, to suit\nthe measure, or of different sound for the rhyme, would have laid me\nunder a constant necessity of searching for variety, and also have\ntended to fix that variety in my mind, and make me master of it.\nTherefore I took some of the tales and turned them into verse; and,\nafter a time, when I had pretty well forgotten the prose, turned them\nback again. I also sometimes jumbled my collections of hints into\nconfusion, and after some weeks endeavored to reduce them into the best\norder, before I began to form the full sentences and compleat the paper.\nThis was to teach me method in the arrangement of thoughts. By comparing\nmy work afterwards with the original, I discovered many faults and\namended them; but I sometimes had the pleasure of fancying that, in\ncertain particulars of small import, I had been lucky enough to improve\nthe method or the language, and this encouraged me to think I might\npossibly in time come to be a tolerable English writer, of which I was\nextremely ambitious. My time for these exercises and for reading was at\nnight, after work or before it began in the morning, or on Sundays, when\nI contrived to be in the printing-house alone, evading as much as I\ncould the common attendance on public worship which my father used to\nexact on me when I was under his care, and which indeed I still thought\na duty, though I could not, as it seemed to me, afford time to practise\nit.\n\nWhen about 16 years of age I happened to meet with a book, written by\none Tryon, recommending a vegetable diet. I determined to go into it. My\nbrother, being yet unmarried, did not keep house, but boarded himself\nand his apprentices in another family. My refusing to eat flesh\noccasioned an inconveniency, and I was frequently chid for my\nsingularity. I made myself acquainted with Tryon's manner of preparing\nsome of his dishes, such as boiling potatoes or rice, making hasty\npudding, and a few others, and then proposed to my brother, that if he\nwould give me, weekly, half the money he paid for my board, I would\nboard myself. He instantly agreed to it, and I presently found that I\ncould save half what he paid me. This was an additional fund for buying\nbooks. But I had another advantage in it. My brother and the rest going\nfrom the printing-house to their meals, I remained there alone, and,\ndespatching presently my light repast, which often was no more than a\nbisket or a slice of bread, a handful of raisins or a tart from the\npastry-cook's, and a glass of water, had the rest of the time till their\nreturn for study, in which I made the greater progress, from that\ngreater clearness of head and quicker apprehension which usually attend\ntemperance in eating and drinking.\n\nAnd now it was that, being on some occasion made asham'd of my ignorance\nin figures, which I had twice failed in learning when at school, I took\nCocker's book of Arithmetick, and went through the whole by myself with\ngreat ease. I also read Seller's and Shermy's books of Navigation, and\nbecame acquainted with the little geometry they contain; but never\nproceeded far in that science. And I read about this time Locke On Human\nUnderstanding, and the Art of Thinking, by Messrs. du Port Royal.\n\nWhile I was intent on improving my language, I met with an English\ngrammar (I think it was Greenwood's), at the end of which there were two\nlittle sketches of the arts of rhetoric and logic, the latter finishing\nwith a specimen of a dispute in the Socratic method; and soon after I\nprocur'd Xenophon's Memorable Things of Socrates, wherein there are many\ninstances of the same method. I was charm'd with it, adopted it, dropt\nmy abrupt contradiction and positive argumentation, and put on the\nhumble inquirer and doubter. And being then, from reading Shaftesbury\nand Collins, become a real doubter in many points of our religious\ndoctrine, I found this method safest for myself and very embarrassing to\nthose against whom I used it; therefore I took a delight in it,\npractis'd it continually, and grew very artful and expert in drawing\npeople, even of superior knowledge, into concessions, the consequences\nof which they did not foresee, entangling them in difficulties out of\nwhich they could not extricate themselves, and so obtaining victories\nthat neither myself nor my cause always deserved. I continu'd this\nmethod some few years, but gradually left it, retaining only the habit\nof expressing myself in terms of modest diffidence; never using, when I\nadvanced any thing that may possibly be disputed, the words certainly,\nundoubtedly, or any others that give the air of positiveness to an\nopinion; but rather say, I conceive or apprehend a thing to be so and\nso; it appears to me, or I should think it so or so, for such and such\nreasons; or I imagine it to be so; or it is so, if I am not mistaken.\nThis habit, I believe, has been of great advantage to me when I have had\noccasion to inculcate my opinions, and persuade men into measures that I\nhave been from time to time engag'd in promoting; and, as the chief ends\nof conversation are to inform or to be informed, to please or to\npersuade, I wish well-meaning, sensible men would not lessen their power\nof doing good by a positive, assuming manner, that seldom fails to\ndisgust, tends to create opposition, and to defeat every one of those\npurposes for which speech was given to us, to wit, giving or receiving\ninformation or pleasure. For, if you would inform, a positive and\ndogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments may provoke contradiction\nand prevent a candid attention. If you wish information and improvement\nfrom the knowledge of others, and yet at the same time express yourself\nas firmly fix'd in your present opinions, modest, sensible men, who do\nnot love disputation, will probably leave you undisturbed in the\npossession of your error. And by such a manner, you can seldom hope to\nrecommend yourself in pleasing your hearers, or to persuade those whose\nconcurrence you desire. Pope says, judiciously:\n\n   \"Men should be taught as if you taught them not,\n    And things unknown propos'd as things forgot;\"\n\nfarther recommending to us\n\n      \"To speak, tho' sure, with seeming diffidence.\"\n\nAnd he might have coupled with this line that which he has coupled with\nanother, I think, less properly,\n\n      \"For want of modesty is want of sense.\"\n\nIf you ask, Why less properly? I must repeat the lines,\n\n      \"Immodest words admit of no defense,\n       For want of modesty is want of sense.\"\n\nNow, is not want of sense (where a man is so unfortunate as to want it)\nsome apology for his want of modesty? and would not the lines stand more\njustly thus?\n\n      \"Immodest words admit but this defense,\n       That want of modesty is want of sense.\"\n\nThis, however, I should submit to better judgments.\n\nMy brother had, in 1720 or 1721, begun to print a newspaper. It was the\nsecond that appeared in America, and was called the New England Courant.\nThe only one before it was the Boston News-Letter. I remember his being\ndissuaded by some of his friends from the undertaking, as not likely to\nsucceed, one newspaper being, in their judgment, enough for America. At\nthis time (1771) there are not less than five-and-twenty. He went on,\nhowever, with the undertaking, and after having worked in composing the\ntypes and printing off the sheets, I was employed to carry the papers\nthro' the streets to the customers.\n\nHe had some ingenious men among his friends, who amus'd themselves by\nwriting little pieces for this paper, which gain'd it credit and made it\nmore in demand, and these gentlemen often visited us. Hearing their\nconversations, and their accounts of the approbation their papers were\nreceived with, I was excited to try my hand among them; but, being still\na boy, and suspecting that my brother would object to printing anything\nof mine in his paper if he knew it to be mine, I contrived to disguise\nmy hand, and, writing an anonymous paper, I put it in at night under the\ndoor of the printing-house. It was found in the morning, and\ncommunicated to his writing friends when they call'd in as usual. They\nread it, commented on it in my hearing, and I had the exquisite pleasure\nof finding it met with their approbation, and that, in their different\nguesses at the author, none were named but men of some character among\nus for learning and ingenuity. I suppose now that I was rather lucky in\nmy judges, and that perhaps they were not really so very good ones as I\nthen esteem'd them.\n\nEncourag'd, however, by this, I wrote and convey'd in the same way to\nthe press several more papers which were equally approv'd; and I kept my\nsecret till my small fund of sense for such performances was pretty well\nexhausted and then I discovered it, when I began to be considered a\nlittle more by my brother's acquaintance, and in a manner that did not\nquite please him, as he thought, probably with reason, that it tended to\nmake me too vain. And, perhaps, this might be one occasion of the\ndifferences that we began to have about this time. Though a brother, he\nconsidered himself as my master, and me as his apprentice, and\naccordingly, expected the same services from me as he would from\nanother, while I thought he demean'd me too much in some he requir'd of\nme, who from a brother expected more indulgence. Our disputes were often\nbrought before our father, and I fancy I was either generally in the\nright, or else a better pleader, because the judgment was generally in\nmy favor. But my brother was passionate, and had often beaten me, which\nI took extreamly amiss; and, thinking my apprenticeship very tedious, I\nwas continually wishing for some opportunity of shortening it, which at\nlength offered in a manner unexpected. [3]\n\n[3] I fancy his harsh and tyrannical treatment of me might be a means of\nimpressing me with that aversion to arbitrary power that has stuck to me\nthrough my whole life.\n\nOne of the pieces in our newspaper on some political point, which I have\nnow forgotten, gave offense to the Assembly. He was taken up, censur'd,\nand imprison'd for a month, by the speaker's warrant, I suppose, because\nhe would not discover his author. I too was taken up and examin'd before\nthe council; but, tho' I did not give them any satisfaction, they\ncontent'd themselves with admonishing me, and dismissed me, considering\nme, perhaps, as an apprentice, who was bound to keep his master's\nsecrets.\n\nDuring my brother's confinement, which I resented a good deal,\nnotwithstanding our private differences, I had the management of the\npaper; and I made bold to give our rulers some rubs in it, which my\nbrother took very kindly, while others began to consider me in an\nunfavorable light, as a young genius that had a turn for libelling and\nsatyr. My brother's discharge was accompany'd with an order of the House\n(a very odd one), that \"James Franklin should no longer print the paper\ncalled the New England Courant.\"\n\nThere was a consultation held in our printing-house among his friends,\nwhat he should do in this case. Some proposed to evade the order by\nchanging the name of the paper; but my brother, seeing inconveniences in\nthat, it was finally concluded on as a better way, to let it be printed\nfor the future under the name of Benjamin Franklin; and to avoid the\ncensure of the Assembly, that might fall on him as still printing it by\nhis apprentice, the contrivance was that my old indenture should be\nreturn'd to me, with a full discharge on the back of it, to be shown on\noccasion, but to secure to him the benefit of my service, I was to sign\nnew indentures for the remainder of the term, which were to be kept\nprivate. A very flimsy scheme it was; however, it was immediately\nexecuted, and the paper went on accordingly, under my name for several\nmonths.\n\nAt length, a fresh difference arising between my brother and me, I took\nupon me to assert my freedom, presuming that he would not venture to\nproduce the new indentures. It was not fair in me to take this\nadvantage, and this I therefore reckon one of the first errata of my\nlife; but the unfairness of it weighed little with me, when under the\nimpressions of resentment for the blows his passion too often urged him\nto bestow upon me, though he was otherwise not an ill-natur'd man:\nperhaps I was too saucy and provoking.\n\nWhen he found I would leave him, he took care to prevent my getting\nemployment in any other printing-house of the town, by going round and\nspeaking to every master, who accordingly refus'd to give me work. I\nthen thought of going to New York, as the nearest place where there was\na printer; and I was rather inclin'd to leave Boston when I reflected\nthat I had already made myself a little obnoxious to the governing\nparty, and, from the arbitrary proceedings of the Assembly in my\nbrother's case, it was likely I might, if I stay'd, soon bring myself\ninto scrapes; and farther, that my indiscrete disputations about\nreligion began to make me pointed at with horror by good people as an\ninfidel or atheist. I determin'd on the point, but my father now siding\nwith my brother, I was sensible that, if I attempted to go openly, means\nwould be used to prevent me. My friend Collins, therefore, undertook to\nmanage a little for me. He agreed with the captain of a New York sloop\nfor my passage, under the notion of my being a young acquaintance of\nhis, that had got a naughty girl with child, whose friends would compel\nme to marry her, and therefore I could not appear or come away publicly.\nSo I sold some of my books to raise a little money, was taken on board\nprivately, and as we had a fair wind, in three days I found myself in\nNew York, near 300 miles from home, a boy of but 17, without the least\nrecommendation to, or knowledge of any person in the place, and with\nvery little money in my pocket.\n\nMy inclinations for the sea were by this time worne out, or I might now\nhave gratify'd them. But, having a trade, and supposing myself a pretty\ngood workman, I offer'd my service to the printer in the place, old Mr.\nWilliam Bradford, who had been the first printer in Pennsylvania, but\nremoved from thence upon the quarrel of George Keith. He could give me\nno employment, having little to do, and help enough already; but says\nhe, \"My son at Philadelphia has lately lost his principal hand, Aquila\nRose, by death; if you go thither, I believe he may employ you.\"\nPhiladelphia was a hundred miles further; I set out, however, in a boat\nfor Amboy, leaving my chest and things to follow me round by sea.\n\nIn crossing the bay, we met with a squall that tore our rotten sails to\npieces, prevented our getting into the Kill, and drove us upon Long\nIsland. In our way, a drunken Dutchman, who was a passenger too, fell\noverboard; when he was sinking, I reached through the water to his shock\npate, and drew him up, so that we got him in again. His ducking sobered\nhim a little, and he went to sleep, taking first out of his pocket a\nbook, which he desir'd I would dry for him. It proved to be my old\nfavorite author, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, in Dutch, finely printed\non good paper, with copper cuts, a dress better than I had ever seen it\nwear in its own language. I have since found that it has been translated\ninto most of the languages of Europe, and suppose it has been more\ngenerally read than any other book, except perhaps the Bible. Honest\nJohn was the first that I know of who mix'd narration and dialogue; a\nmethod of writing very engaging to the reader, who in the most\ninteresting parts finds himself, as it were, brought into the company\nand present at the discourse. De Foe in his Cruso, his Moll Flanders,\nReligious Courtship, Family Instructor, and other pieces, has imitated\nit with success; and Richardson has done the same in his Pamela, etc.\n\nWhen we drew near the island, we found it was at a place where there\ncould be no landing, there being a great surff on the stony beach. So we\ndropt anchor, and swung round towards the shore. Some people came down\nto the water edge and hallow'd to us, as we did to them; but the wind\nwas so high, and the surff so loud, that we could not hear so as to\nunderstand each other. There were canoes on the shore, and we made\nsigns, and hallow'd that they should fetch us; but they either did not\nunderstand us, or thought it impracticable, so they went away, and night\ncoming on, we had no remedy but to wait till the wind should abate; and,\nin the meantime, the boatman and I concluded to sleep, if we could; and\nso crowded into the scuttle, with the Dutchman, who was still wet, and\nthe spray beating over the head of our boat, leak'd thro' to us, so that\nwe were soon almost as wet as he. In this manner we lay all night, with\nvery little rest; but, the wind abating the next day, we made a shift to\nreach Amboy before night, having been thirty hours on the water, without\nvictuals, or any drink but a bottle of filthy rum, and the water we\nsail'd on being salt.\n\nIn the evening I found myself very feverish, and went in to bed; but,\nhaving read somewhere that cold water drank plentifully was good for a\nfever, I follow'd the prescription, sweat plentiful most of the night,\nmy fever left me, and in the morning, crossing the ferry, I proceeded on\nmy journey on foot, having fifty miles to Burlington, where I was told I\nshould find boats that would carry me the rest of the way to\nPhiladelphia.\n\nIt rained very hard all the day; I was thoroughly soak'd, and by noon a\ngood deal tired; so I stopt at a poor inn, where I staid all night,\nbeginning now to wish that I had never left home. I cut so miserable a\nfigure, too, that I found, by the questions ask'd me, I was suspected to\nbe some runaway servant, and in danger of being taken up on that\nsuspicion. However, I proceeded the next day, and got in the evening to\nan inn, within eight or ten miles of Burlington, kept by one Dr. Brown.\nHe entered into conversation with me while I took some refreshment, and,\nfinding I had read a little, became very sociable and friendly. Our\nacquaintance continu'd as long as he liv'd. He had been, I imagine, an\nitinerant doctor, for there was no town in England, or country in\nEurope, of which he could not give a very particular account. He had\nsome letters, and was ingenious, but much of an unbeliever, and wickedly\nundertook, some years after, to travestie the Bible in doggrel verse, as\nCotton had done Virgil. By this means he set many of the facts in a very\nridiculous light, and might have hurt weak minds if his work had been\npublished; but it never was.\n\nAt his house I lay that night, and the next morning reach'd Burlington,\nbut had the mortification to find that the regular boats were gone a\nlittle before my coming, and no other expected to go before Tuesday,\nthis being Saturday; wherefore I returned to an old woman in the town,\nof whom I had bought gingerbread to eat on the water, and ask'd her\nadvice. She invited me to lodge at her house till a passage by water\nshould offer; and being tired with my foot travelling, I accepted the\ninvitation. She understanding I was a printer, would have had me stay at\nthat town and follow my business, being ignorant of the stock necessary\nto begin with. She was very hospitable, gave me a dinner of ox-cheek\nwith great good will, accepting only a pot of ale in return; and I\nthought myself fixed till Tuesday should come. However, walking in the\nevening by the side of the river, a boat came by, which I found was\ngoing towards Philadelphia, with several people in her. They took me in,\nand, as there was no wind, we row'd all the way; and about midnight, not\nhaving yet seen the city, some of the company were confident we must\nhave passed it, and would row no farther; the others knew not where we\nwere; so we put toward the shore, got into a creek, landed near an old\nfence, with the rails of which we made a fire, the night being cold, in\nOctober, and there we remained till daylight. Then one of the company\nknew the place to be Cooper's Creek, a little above Philadelphia, which\nwe saw as soon as we got out of the creek, and arriv'd there about eight\nor nine o'clock on the Sunday morning, and landed at the Market-street\nwharf.\n\nI have been the more particular in this description of my journey, and\nshall be so of my first entry into that city, that you may in your mind\ncompare such unlikely beginnings with the figure I have since made\nthere. I was in my working dress, my best cloaths being to come round by\nsea. I was dirty from my journey; my pockets were stuff'd out with\nshirts and stockings, and I knew no soul nor where to look for lodging.\nI was fatigued with travelling, rowing, and want of rest, I was very\nhungry; and my whole stock of cash consisted of a Dutch dollar, and\nabout a shilling in copper. The latter I gave the people of the boat for\nmy passage, who at first refus'd it, on account of my rowing; but I\ninsisted on their taking it. A man being sometimes more generous when he\nhas but a little money than when he has plenty, perhaps thro' fear of\nbeing thought to have but little.\n\nThen I walked up the street, gazing about till near the market-house I\nmet a boy with bread. I had made many a meal on bread, and, inquiring\nwhere he got it, I went immediately to the baker's he directed me to, in\nSecond-street, and ask'd for bisket, intending such as we had in Boston;\nbut they, it seems, were not made in Philadelphia. Then I asked for a\nthree-penny loaf, and was told they had none such. So not considering or\nknowing the difference of money, and the greater cheapness nor the names\nof his bread, I made him give me three-penny worth of any sort. He gave\nme, accordingly, three great puffy rolls. I was surpriz'd at the\nquantity, but took it, and, having no room in my pockets, walk'd off\nwith a roll under each arm, and eating the other. Thus I went up\nMarket-street as far as Fourth-street, passing by the door of Mr. Read,\nmy future wife's father; when she, standing at the door, saw me, and\nthought I made, as I certainly did, a most awkward, ridiculous\nappearance. Then I turned and went down Chestnut-street and part of\nWalnut-street, eating my roll all the way, and, coming round, found\nmyself again at Market-street wharf, near the boat I came in, to which I\nwent for a draught of the river water; and, being filled with one of my\nrolls, gave the other two to a woman and her child that came down the\nriver in the boat with us, and were waiting to go farther.\n\nThus refreshed, I walked again up the street, which by this time had\nmany clean-dressed people in it, who were all walking the same way. I\njoined them, and thereby was led into the great meeting-house of the\nQuakers near the market. I sat down among them, and, after looking round\nawhile and hearing nothing said, being very drowsy thro' labor and want\nof rest the preceding night, I fell fast asleep, and continued so till\nthe meeting broke up, when one was kind enough to rouse me. This was,\ntherefore, the first house I was in, or slept in, in Philadelphia.\n\nWalking down again toward the river, and, looking in the faces of\npeople, I met a young Quaker man, whose countenance I lik'd, and,\naccosting him, requested he would tell me where a stranger could get\nlodging. We were then near the sign of the Three Mariners. \"Here,\" says\nhe, \"is one place that entertains strangers, but it is not a reputable\nhouse; if thee wilt walk with me, I'll show thee a better.\" He brought\nme to the Crooked Billet in Water-street. Here I got a dinner; and,\nwhile I was eating it, several sly questions were asked me, as it seemed\nto be suspected from my youth and appearance, that I might be some\nrunaway.\n\nAfter dinner, my sleepiness return'd, and being shown to a bed, I lay\ndown without undressing, and slept till six in the evening, was call'd\nto supper, went to bed again very early, and slept soundly till next\nmorning. Then I made myself as tidy as I could, and went to Andrew\nBradford the printer's. I found in the shop the old man his father, whom\nI had seen at New York, and who, travelling on horseback, had got to\nPhiladelphia before me. He introduc'd me to his son, who receiv'd me\ncivilly, gave me a breakfast, but told me he did not at present want a\nhand, being lately suppli'd with one; but there was another printer in\ntown, lately set up, one Keimer, who, perhaps, might employ me; if not,\nI should be welcome to lodge at his house, and he would give me a little\nwork to do now and then till fuller business should offer.\n\nThe old gentleman said he would go with me to the new printer; and when\nwe found him, \"Neighbor,\" says Bradford, \"I have brought to see you a\nyoung man of your business; perhaps you may want such a one.\" He ask'd\nme a few questions, put a composing stick in my hand to see how I\nwork'd, and then said he would employ me soon, though he had just then\nnothing for me to do; and, taking old Bradford, whom he had never seen\nbefore, to be one of the town's people that had a good will for him,\nenter'd into a conversation on his present undertaking and prospects;\nwhile Bradford, not discovering that he was the other printer's father,\non Keimer's saying he expected soon to get the greatest part of the\nbusiness into his own hands, drew him on by artful questions, and\nstarting little doubts, to explain all his views, what interests he\nreli'd on, and in what manner he intended to proceed. I, who stood by\nand heard all, saw immediately that one of them was a crafty old\nsophister, and the other a mere novice. Bradford left me with Keimer,\nwho was greatly surpris'd when I told him who the old man was.\n\nKeimer's printing-house, I found, consisted of an old shatter'd press,\nand one small, worn-out font of English which he was then using himself,\ncomposing an Elegy on Aquila Rose, before mentioned, an ingenious young\nman, of excellent character, much respected in the town, clerk of the\nAssembly, and a pretty poet. Keimer made verses too, but very\nindifferently. He could not be said to write them, for his manner was to\ncompose them in the types directly out of his head. So there being no\ncopy, but one pair of cases, and the Elegy likely to require all the\nletter, no one could help him. I endeavor'd to put his press (which he\nhad not yet us'd, and of which he understood nothing) into order fit to\nbe work'd with; and, promising to come and print off his Elegy as soon\nas he should have got it ready, I return'd to Bradford's, who gave me a\nlittle job to do for the present, and there I lodged and dieted. A few\ndays after, Keimer sent for me to print off the Elegy. And now he had\ngot another pair of cases, and a pamphlet to reprint, on which he set me\nto work.\n\nThese two printers I found poorly qualified for their business. Bradford\nhad not been bred to it, and was very illiterate; and Keimer, tho'\nsomething of a scholar, was a mere compositor, knowing nothing of\npresswork. He had been one of the French prophets, and could act their\nenthusiastic agitations. At this time he did not profess any particular\nreligion, but something of all on occasion; was very ignorant of the\nworld, and had, as I afterward found, a good deal of the knave in his\ncomposition. He did not like my lodging at Bradford's while I work'd\nwith him. He had a house, indeed, but without furniture, so he could not\nlodge me; but he got me a lodging at Mr. Read's, before mentioned, who\nwas the owner of his house; and, my chest and clothes being come by this\ntime, I made rather a more respectable appearance in the eyes of Miss\nRead than I had done when she first happen'd to see me eating my roll in\nthe street.\n\nI began now to have some acquaintance among the young people of the\ntown, that were lovers of reading, with whom I spent my evenings very\npleasantly; and gaining money by my industry and frugality, I lived very\nagreeably, forgetting Boston as much as I could, and not desiring that\nany there should know where I resided, except my friend Collins, who was\nin my secret, and kept it when I wrote to him. At length, an incident\nhappened that sent me back again much sooner than I had intended. I had\na brother-in-law, Robert Holmes, master of a sloop that traded between\nBoston and Delaware. He being at Newcastle, forty miles below\nPhiladelphia, heard there of me, and wrote me a letter mentioning the\nconcern of my friends in Boston at my abrupt departure, assuring me of\ntheir good will to me, and that every thing would be accommodated to my\nmind if I would return, to which he exhorted me very earnestly. I wrote\nan answer to his letter, thank'd him for his advice, but stated my\nreasons for quitting Boston fully and in such a light as to convince him\nI was not so wrong as he had apprehended.\n\nSir William Keith, governor of the province, was then at Newcastle, and\nCaptain Holmes, happening to be in company with him when my letter came\nto hand, spoke to him of me, and show'd him the letter. The governor\nread it, and seem'd surpris'd when he was told my age. He said I\nappear'd a young man of promising parts, and therefore should be\nencouraged; the printers at Philadelphia were wretched ones; and, if I\nwould set up there, he made no doubt I should succeed; for his part, he\nwould procure me the public business, and do me every other service in\nhis power. This my brother-in-law afterwards told me in Boston, but I\nknew as yet nothing of it; when, one day, Keimer and I being at work\ntogether near the window, we saw the governor and another gentleman\n(which proved to be Colonel French, of Newcastle), finely dress'd, come\ndirectly across the street to our house, and heard them at the door.\n\nKeimer ran down immediately, thinking it a visit to him; but the\ngovernor inquir'd for me, came up, and with a condescension of\npoliteness I had been quite unus'd to, made me many compliments, desired\nto be acquainted with me, blam'd me kindly for not having made myself\nknown to him when I first came to the place, and would have me away with\nhim to the tavern, where he was going with Colonel French to taste, as\nhe said, some excellent Madeira. I was not a little surprised, and\nKeimer star'd like a pig poison'd. I went, however, with the governor\nand Colonel French to a tavern, at the corner of Third-street, and over\nthe Madeira he propos'd my setting up my business, laid before me the\nprobabilities of success, and both he and Colonel French assur'd me I\nshould have their interest and influence in procuring the public\nbusiness of both governments. On my doubting whether my father would\nassist me in it, Sir William said he would give me a letter to him, in\nwhich he would state the advantages, and he did not doubt of prevailing\nwith him. So it was concluded I should return to Boston in the first\nvessel, with the governor's letter recommending me to my father. In the\nmean time the intention was to be kept a secret, and I went on working\nwith Keimer as usual, the governor sending for me now and then to dine\nwith him, a very great honor I thought it, and conversing with me in the\nmost affable, familiar, and friendly manner imaginable.\n\nAbout the end of April, 1724, a little vessel offer'd for Boston. I took\nleave of Keimer as going to see my friends. The governor gave me an\nample letter, saying many flattering things of me to my father, and\nstrongly recommending the project of my setting up at Philadelphia as a\nthing that must make my fortune. We struck on a shoal in going down the\nbay, and sprung a leak; we had a blustering time at sea, and were\noblig'd to pump almost continually, at which I took my turn. We arriv'd\nsafe, however, at Boston in about a fortnight. I had been absent seven\nmonths, and my friends had heard nothing of me; for my br. Holmes was\nnot yet return'd, and had not written about me. My unexpected appearance\nsurpriz'd the family; all were, however, very glad to see me, and made\nme welcome, except my brother. I went to see him at his printing-house.\nI was better dress'd than ever while in his service, having a genteel\nnew suit from head to foot, a watch, and my pockets lin'd with near five\npounds sterling in silver. He receiv'd me not very frankly, look'd me\nall over, and turn'd to his work again.\n\nThe journeymen were inquisitive where I had been, what sort of a country\nit was, and how I lik'd it. I prais'd it much, the happy life I led in\nit, expressing strongly my intention of returning to it; and, one of\nthem asking what kind of money we had there, I produc'd a handful of\nsilver, and spread it before them, which was a kind of raree-show they\nhad not been us'd to, paper being the money of Boston. Then I took an\nopportunity of letting them see my watch; and, lastly (my brother still\ngrum and sullen), I gave them a piece of eight to drink, and took my\nleave. This visit of mine offended him extreamly; for, when my mother\nsome time after spoke to him of a reconciliation, and of her wishes to\nsee us on good terms together, and that we might live for the future as\nbrothers, he said I had insulted him in such a manner before his people\nthat he could never forget or forgive it. In this, however, he was\nmistaken.\n\nMy father received the governor's letter with some apparent surprise,\nbut said little of it to me for some days, when Capt. Holmes returning\nhe showed it to him, ask'd him if he knew Keith, and what kind of man he\nwas; adding his opinion that he must be of small discretion to think of\nsetting a boy up in business who wanted yet three years of being at\nman's estate. Holmes said what he could in favor of the project, but my\nfather was clear in the impropriety of it, and at last gave a flat\ndenial to it. Then he wrote a civil letter to Sir William, thanking him\nfor the patronage he had so kindly offered me, but declining to assist\nme as yet in setting up, I being, in his opinion, too young to be\ntrusted with the management of a business so important, and for which\nthe preparation must be so expensive.\n\nMy friend and companion Collins, who was a clerk in the post-office,\npleas'd with the account I gave him of my new country, determined to go\nthither also; and, while I waited for my father's determination, he set\nout before me by land to Rhode Island, leaving his books, which were a\npretty collection of mathematicks and natural philosophy, to come with\nmine and me to New York, where he propos'd to wait for me.\n\nMy father, tho' he did not approve Sir William's proposition, was yet\npleas'd that I had been able to obtain so advantageous a character from\na person of such note where I had resided, and that I had been so\nindustrious and careful as to equip myself so handsomely in so short a\ntime; therefore, seeing no prospect of an accommodation between my\nbrother and me, he gave his consent to my returning again to\nPhiladelphia, advis'd me to behave respectfully to the people there,\nendeavor to obtain the general esteem, and avoid lampooning and\nlibeling, to which he thought I had too much inclination; telling me,\nthat by steady industry and a prudent parsimony I might save enough by\nthe time I was one-and-twenty to set me up; and that, if I came near the\nmatter, he would help me out with the rest. This was all I could obtain,\nexcept some small gifts as tokens of his and my mother's love, when I\nembark'd again for New York, now with their approbation and their\nblessing.\n\nThe sloop putting in at Newport, Rhode Island, I visited my brother\nJohn, who had been married and settled there some years. He received me\nvery affectionately, for he always lov'd me. A friend of his, one\nVernon, having some money due to him in Pensilvania, about thirty-five\npounds currency, desired I would receive it for him, and keep it till I\nhad his directions what to remit it in. Accordingly, he gave me an\norder. This afterwards occasion'd me a good deal of uneasiness.\n\nAt Newport we took in a number of passengers for New York, among which\nwere two young women, companions, and a grave, sensible, matron-like\nQuaker woman, with her attendants. I had shown an obliging readiness to\ndo her some little services, which impress'd her I suppose with a degree\nof good will toward me; therefore, when she saw a daily growing\nfamiliarity between me and the two young women, which they appear'd to\nencourage, she took me aside, and said: \"Young man, I am concern'd for\nthee, as thou has no friend with thee, and seems not to know much of the\nworld, or of the snares youth is expos'd to; depend upon it, those are\nvery bad women; I can see it in all their actions; and if thee art not\nupon thy guard, they will draw thee into some danger; they are strangers\nto thee, and I advise thee, in a friendly concern for thy welfare, to\nhave no acquaintance with them.\" As I seem'd at first not to think so\nill of them as she did, she mentioned some things she had observ'd and\nheard that had escap'd my notice, but now convinc'd me she was right. I\nthank'd her for her kind advice, and promis'd to follow it. When we\narriv'd at New York, they told me where they liv'd, and invited me to\ncome and see them; but I avoided it, and it was well I did; for the next\nday the captain miss'd a silver spoon and some other things, that had\nbeen taken out of his cabbin, and, knowing that these were a couple of\nstrumpets, he got a warrant to search their lodgings, found the stolen\ngoods, and had the thieves punish'd. So, tho' we had escap'd a sunken\nrock, which we scrap'd upon in the passage, I thought this escape of\nrather more importance to me.\n\nAt New York I found my friend Collins, who had arriv'd there some time\nbefore me. We had been intimate from children, and had read the same\nbooks together; but he had the advantage of more time for reading and\nstudying, and a wonderful genius for mathematical learning, in which he\nfar outstript me. While I liv'd in Boston most of my hours of leisure\nfor conversation were spent with him, and he continu'd a sober as well\nas an industrious lad; was much respected for his learning by several of\nthe clergy and other gentlemen, and seemed to promise making a good\nfigure in life. But, during my absence, he had acquir'd a habit of\nsotting with brandy; and I found by his own account, and what I heard\nfrom others, that he had been drunk every day since his arrival at New\nYork, and behav'd very oddly. He had gam'd, too, and lost his money, so\nthat I was oblig'd to discharge his lodgings, and defray his expenses to\nand at Philadelphia, which prov'd extremely inconvenient to me.\n\nThe then governor of New York, Burnet (son of Bishop Burnet), hearing\nfrom the captain that a young man, one of his passengers, had a great\nmany books, desir'd he would bring me to see him. I waited upon him\naccordingly, and should have taken Collins with me but that he was not\nsober. The gov'r. treated me with great civility, show'd me his library,\nwhich was a very large one, and we had a good deal of conversation about\nbooks and authors. This was the second governor who had done me the\nhonor to take notice of me; which, to a poor boy like me, was very\npleasing.\n\nWe proceeded to Philadelphia. I received on the way Vernon's money,\nwithout which we could hardly have finish'd our journey. Collins wished\nto be employ'd in some counting-house, but, whether they discover'd his\ndramming by his breath, or by his behaviour, tho' he had some\nrecommendations, he met with no success in any application, and\ncontinu'd lodging and boarding at the same house with me, and at my\nexpense. Knowing I had that money of Vernon's, he was continually\nborrowing of me, still promising repayment as soon as he should be in\nbusiness. At length he had got so much of it that I was distress'd to\nthink what I should do in case of being call'd on to remit it.\n\nHis drinking continu'd, about which we sometimes quarrell'd; for, when a\nlittle intoxicated, he was very fractious. Once, in a boat on the\nDelaware with some other young men, he refused to row in his turn. \"I\nwill be row'd home,\" says he. \"We will not row you,\" says I. \"You must,\nor stay all night on the water,\" says he, \"just as you please.\" The\nothers said, \"Let us row; what signifies it?\" But, my mind being soured\nwith his other conduct, I continu'd to refuse. So he swore he would make\nme row, or throw me overboard; and coming along, stepping on the\nthwarts, toward me, when he came up and struck at me, I clapped my hand\nunder his crutch, and, rising, pitched him head-foremost into the river.\nI knew he was a good swimmer, and so was under little concern about him;\nbut before he could get round to lay hold of the boat, we had with a few\nstrokes pull'd her out of his reach; and ever when he drew near the\nboat, we ask'd if he would row, striking a few strokes to slide her away\nfrom him. He was ready to die with vexation, and obstinately would not\npromise to row. However, seeing him at last beginning to tire, we lifted\nhim in and brought him home dripping wet in the evening. We hardly\nexchang'd a civil word afterwards, and a West India captain, who had a\ncommission to procure a tutor for the sons of a gentleman at Barbadoes,\nhappening to meet with him, agreed to carry him thither. He left me\nthen, promising to remit me the first money he should receive in order\nto discharge the debt; but I never heard of him after.\n\nThe breaking into this money of Vernon's was one of the first great\nerrata of my life; and this affair show'd that my father was not much\nout in his judgment when he suppos'd me too young to manage business of\nimportance. But Sir William, on reading his letter, said he was too\nprudent. There was great difference in persons; and discretion did not\nalways accompany years, nor was youth always without it. \"And since he\nwill not set you up,\" says he, \"I will do it myself. Give me an\ninventory of the things necessary to be had from England, and I will\nsend for them. You shall repay me when you are able; I am resolv'd to\nhave a good printer here, and I am sure you must succeed.\" This was\nspoken with such an appearance of cordiality, that I had not the least\ndoubt of his meaning what he said. I had hitherto kept the proposition\nof my setting up, a secret in Philadelphia, and I still kept it. Had it\nbeen known that I depended on the governor, probably some friend, that\nknew him better, would have advis'd me not to rely on him, as I\nafterwards heard it as his known character to be liberal of promises\nwhich he never meant to keep. Yet, unsolicited as he was by me, how\ncould I think his generous offers insincere? I believ'd him one of the\nbest men in the world.\n\nI presented him an inventory of a little print'g-house, amounting by my\ncomputation to about one hundred pounds sterling. He lik'd it, but ask'd\nme if my being on the spot in England to chuse the types, and see that\nevery thing was good of the kind, might not be of some advantage.\n\"Then,\" says he, \"when there, you may make acquaintances, and establish\ncorrespondences in the bookselling and stationery way.\" I agreed that\nthis might be advantageous. \"Then,\" says he, \"get yourself ready to go\nwith Annis;\" which was the annual ship, and the only one at that time\nusually passing between London and Philadelphia. But it would be some\nmonths before Annis sail'd, so I continu'd working with Keimer, fretting\nabout the money Collins had got from me, and in daily apprehensions of\nbeing call'd upon by Vernon, which, however, did not happen for some\nyears after.\n\nI believe I have omitted mentioning that, in my first voyage from\nBoston, being becalm'd off Block Island, our people set about catching\ncod, and hauled up a great many. Hitherto I had stuck to my resolution\nof not eating animal food, and on this occasion consider'd, with my\nmaster Tryon, the taking every fish as a kind of unprovoked murder,\nsince none of them had, or ever could do us any injury that might\njustify the slaughter. All this seemed very reasonable. But I had\nformerly been a great lover of fish, and, when this came hot out of the\nfrying-pan, it smelt admirably well. I balanc'd some time between\nprinciple and inclination, till I recollected that, when the fish were\nopened, I saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs; then thought I,\n\"If you eat one another, I don't see why we mayn't eat you.\" So I din'd\nupon cod very heartily, and continued to eat with other people,\nreturning only now and then occasionally to a vegetable diet. So\nconvenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables\none to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.\n\nKeimer and I liv'd on a pretty good familiar footing, and agreed\ntolerably well, for he suspected nothing of my setting up. He retained a\ngreat deal of his old enthusiasms and lov'd argumentation. We therefore\nhad many disputations. I used to work him so with my Socratic method,\nand had trepann'd him so often by questions apparently so distant from\nany point we had in hand, and yet by degrees lead to the point, and\nbrought him into difficulties and contradictions, that at last he grew\nridiculously cautious, and would hardly answer me the most common\nquestion, without asking first, \"What do you intend to infer from that?\"\nHowever, it gave him so high an opinion of my abilities in the confuting\nway, that he seriously proposed my being his colleague in a project he\nhad of setting up a new sect. He was to preach the doctrines, and I was\nto confound all opponents. When he came to explain with me upon the\ndoctrines, I found several conundrums which I objected to, unless I\nmight have my way a little too, and introduce some of mine.\n\nKeimer wore his beard at full length, because somewhere in the Mosaic\nlaw it is said, \"Thou shalt not mar the corners of thy beard.\" He\nlikewise kept the Seventh day, Sabbath; and these two points were\nessentials with him. I dislik'd both; but agreed to admit them upon\ncondition of his adopting the doctrine of using no animal food. \"I\ndoubt,\" said he, \"my constitution will not bear that.\" I assur'd him it\nwould, and that he would be the better for it. He was usually a great\nglutton, and I promised myself some diversion in half starving him. He\nagreed to try the practice, if I would keep him company. I did so, and\nwe held it for three months. We had our victuals dress'd, and brought to\nus regularly by a woman in the neighborhood, who had from me a list of\nforty dishes to be prepar'd for us at different times, in all which\nthere was neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, and the whim suited me the\nbetter at this time from the cheapness of it, not costing us above\neighteenpence sterling each per week. I have since kept several Lents\nmost strictly, leaving the common diet for that, and that for the\ncommon, abruptly, without the least inconvenience, so that I think there\nis little in the advice of making those changes by easy gradations. I\nwent on pleasantly, but poor Keimer suffered grievously, tired of the\nproject, long'd for the flesh-pots of Egypt, and order'd a roast pig. He\ninvited me and two women friends to dine with him; but, it being brought\ntoo soon upon table, he could not resist the temptation, and ate the\nwhole before we came.\n\nI had made some courtship during this time to Miss Read. I had a great\nrespect and affection for her, and had some reason to believe she had\nthe same for me; but, as I was about to take a long voyage, and we were\nboth very young, only a little above eighteen, it was thought most\nprudent by her mother to prevent our going too far at present, as a\nmarriage, if it was to take place, would be more convenient after my\nreturn, when I should be, as I expected, set up in my business. Perhaps,\ntoo, she thought my expectations not so well founded as I imagined them\nto be.\n\nMy chief acquaintances at this time were Charles Osborne, Joseph Watson,\nand James Ralph, all lovers of reading. The two first were clerks to an\neminent scrivener or conveyancer in the town, Charles Brogden; the other\nwas clerk to a merchant. Watson was a pious, sensible young man, of\ngreat integrity; the others rather more lax in their principles of\nreligion, particularly Ralph, who, as well as Collins, had been\nunsettled by me, for which they both made me suffer. Osborne was\nsensible, candid, frank; sincere and affectionate to his friends; but,\nin literary matters, too fond of criticising. Ralph was ingenious,\ngenteel in his manners, and extremely eloquent; I think I never knew a\nprettier talker. Both of them great admirers of poetry, and began to try\ntheir hands in little pieces. Many pleasant walks we four had together\non Sundays into the woods, near Schuylkill, where we read to one\nanother, and conferr'd on what we read.\n\nRalph was inclin'd to pursue the study of poetry, not doubting but he\nmight become eminent in it, and make his fortune by it, alleging that\nthe best poets must, when they first began to write, make as many faults\nas he did. Osborne dissuaded him, assur'd him he had no genius for\npoetry, and advis'd him to think of nothing beyond the business he was\nbred to; that, in the mercantile way, tho' he had no stock, he might, by\nhis diligence and punctuality, recommend himself to employment as a\nfactor, and in time acquire wherewith to trade on his own account. I\napprov'd the amusing one's self with poetry now and then, so far as to\nimprove one's language, but no farther.\n\nOn this it was propos'd that we should each of us, at our next meeting,\nproduce a piece of our own composing, in order to improve by our mutual\nobservations, criticisms, and corrections. As language and expression\nwere what we had in view, we excluded all considerations of invention by\nagreeing that the task should be a version of the eighteenth Psalm,\nwhich describes the descent of a Deity. When the time of our meeting\ndrew nigh, Ralph called on me first, and let me know his piece was\nready. I told him I had been busy, and, having little inclination, had\ndone nothing. He then show'd me his piece for my opinion, and I much\napprov'd it, as it appear'd to me to have great merit. \"Now,\" says he,\n\"Osborne never will allow the least merit in any thing of mine, but\nmakes 1000 criticisms out of mere envy. He is not so jealous of you; I\nwish, therefore, you would take this piece, and produce it as yours; I\nwill pretend not to have had time, and so produce nothing. We shall then\nsee what he will say to it.\" It was agreed, and I immediately\ntranscrib'd it, that it might appear in my own hand.\n\nWe met; Watson's performance was read; there were some beauties in it,\nbut many defects. Osborne's was read; it was much better; Ralph did it\njustice; remarked some faults, but applauded the beauties. He himself\nhad nothing to produce. I was backward; seemed desirous of being\nexcused; had not had sufficient time to correct, etc.; but no excuse\ncould be admitted; produce I must. It was read and repeated; Watson and\nOsborne gave up the contest, and join'd in applauding it. Ralph only\nmade some criticisms, and propos'd some amendments; but I defended my\ntext. Osborne was against Ralph, and told him he was no better a critic\nthan poet, so he dropt the argument. As they two went home together,\nOsborne expressed himself still more strongly in favor of what he\nthought my production; having restrain'd himself before, as he said,\nlest I should think it flattery. \"But who would have imagin'd,\" said he,\n\"that Franklin had been capable of such a performance; such painting,\nsuch force, such fire! He has even improv'd the original. In his common\nconversation he seems to have no choice of words; he hesitates and\nblunders; and yet, good God! how he writes!\" When we next met, Ralph\ndiscovered the trick we had plaid him, and Osborne was a little laught\nat.\n\nThis transaction fixed Ralph in his resolution of becoming a poet. I did\nall I could to dissuade him from it, but he continued scribbling verses\ntill Pope cured him. He became, however, a pretty good prose writer.\nMore of him hereafter. But, as I may not have occasion again to mention\nthe other two, I shall just remark here, that Watson died in my arms a\nfew years after, much lamented, being the best of our set. Osborne went\nto the West Indies, where he became an eminent lawyer and made money,\nbut died young. He and I had made a serious agreement, that the one who\nhappen'd first to die should, if possible, make a friendly visit to the\nother, and acquaint him how he found things in that separate state. But\nhe never fulfill'd his promise.\n\nThe governor, seeming to like my company, had me frequently to his\nhouse, and his setting me up was always mention'd as a fixed thing. I\nwas to take with me letters recommendatory to a number of his friends,\nbesides the letter of credit to furnish me with the necessary money for\npurchasing the press and types, paper, etc. For these letters I was\nappointed to call at different times, when they were to be ready, but a\nfuture time was still named. Thus he went on till the ship, whose\ndeparture too had been several times postponed, was on the point of\nsailing. Then, when I call'd to take my leave and receive the letters,\nhis secretary, Dr. Bard, came out to me and said the governor was\nextremely busy in writing, but would be down at Newcastle before the\nship, and there the letters would be delivered to me.\n\nRalph, though married, and having one child, had determined to accompany\nme in this voyage. It was thought he intended to establish a\ncorrespondence, and obtain goods to sell on commission; but I found\nafterwards, that, thro' some discontent with his wife's relations, he\npurposed to leave her on their hands, and never return again. Having\ntaken leave of my friends, and interchang'd some promises with Miss\nRead, I left Philadelphia in the ship, which anchor'd at Newcastle. The\ngovernor was there; but when I went to his lodging, the secretary came\nto me from him with the civillest message in the world, that he could\nnot then see me, being engaged in business of the utmost importance, but\nshould send the letters to me on board, wish'd me heartily a good voyage\nand a speedy return, etc. I returned on board a little puzzled, but\nstill not doubting.\n\nMr. Andrew Hamilton, a famous lawyer of Philadelphia, had taken passage\nin the same ship for himself and son, and with Mr. Denham, a Quaker\nmerchant, and Messrs. Onion and Russel, masters of an iron work in\nMaryland, had engag'd the great cabin; so that Ralph and I were forced\nto take up with a berth in the steerage, and none on board knowing us,\nwere considered as ordinary persons. But Mr. Hamilton and his son (it\nwas James, since governor) return'd from Newcastle to Philadelphia, the\nfather being recall'd by a great fee to plead for a seized ship; and,\njust before we sail'd, Colonel French coming on board, and showing me\ngreat respect, I was more taken notice of, and, with my friend Ralph,\ninvited by the other gentlemen to come into the cabin, there being now\nroom. Accordingly, we remov'd thither.\n\nUnderstanding that Colonel French had brought on board the governor's\ndespatches, I ask'd the captain for those letters that were to be under\nmy care. He said all were put into the bag together and he could not\nthen come at them; but, before we landed in England, I should have an\nopportunity of picking them out; so I was satisfied for the present, and\nwe proceeded on our voyage. We had a sociable company in the cabin, and\nlived uncommonly well, having the addition of all Mr. Hamilton's stores,\nwho had laid in plentifully. In this passage Mr. Denham contracted a\nfriendship for me that continued during his life. The voyage was\notherwise not a pleasant one, as we had a great deal of bad weather.\n\nWhen we came into the Channel, the captain kept his word with me, and\ngave me an opportunity of examining the bag for the governor's letters.\nI found none upon which my name was put as under my care. I picked out\nsix or seven, that, by the handwriting, I thought might be the promised\nletters, especially as one of them was directed to Basket, the king's\nprinter, and another to some stationer. We arriv'd in London the 24th of\nDecember, 1724. I waited upon the stationer, who came first in my way,\ndelivering the letter as from Governor Keith. \"I don't know such a\nperson,\" says he; but, opening the letter, \"O! this is from Riddlesden.\nI have lately found him to be a compleat rascal, and I will have nothing\nto do with him, nor receive any letters from him.\" So, putting the\nletter into my hand, he turn'd on his heel and left me to serve some\ncustomer. I was surprized to find these were not the governor's letters;\nand, after recollecting and comparing circumstances, I began to doubt\nhis sincerity. I found my friend Denham, and opened the whole affair to\nhim. He let me into Keith's character; told me there was not the least\nprobability that he had written any letters for me; that no one, who\nknew him, had the smallest dependence on him; and he laught at the\nnotion of the governor's giving me a letter of credit, having, as he\nsaid, no credit to give. On my expressing some concern about what I\nshould do, he advised me to endeavor getting some employment in the way\nof my business. \"Among the printers here,\" said he, \"you will improve\nyourself, and when you return to America, you will set up to greater\nadvantage.\"\n\nWe both of us happen'd to know, as well as the stationer, that\nRiddlesden, the attorney, was a very knave. He had half ruin'd Miss\nRead's father by persuading him to be bound for him. By this letter it\nappear'd there was a secret scheme on foot to the prejudice of Hamilton\n(suppos'd to be then coming over with us); and that Keith was concerned\nin it with Riddlesden. Denham, who was a friend of Hamilton's thought he\nought to be acquainted with it; so, when he arriv'd in England, which\nwas soon after, partly from resentment and ill-will to Keith and\nRiddlesden, and partly from good-will to him, I waited on him, and gave\nhim the letter. He thank'd me cordially, the information being of\nimportance to him; and from that time he became my friend, greatly to my\nadvantage afterwards on many occasions.\n\nBut what shall we think of a governor's playing such pitiful tricks, and\nimposing so grossly on a poor ignorant boy! It was a habit he had\nacquired. He wish'd to please everybody; and, having little to give, he\ngave expectations. He was otherwise an ingenious, sensible man, a pretty\ngood writer, and a good governor for the people, tho' not for his\nconstituents, the proprietaries, whose instructions he sometimes\ndisregarded. Several of our best laws were of his planning and passed\nduring his administration.\n\nRalph and I were inseparable companions. We took lodgings together in\nLittle Britain at three shillings and sixpence a week--as much as we\ncould then afford. He found some relations, but they were poor, and\nunable to assist him. He now let me know his intentions of remaining in\nLondon, and that he never meant to return to Philadelphia. He had\nbrought no money with him, the whole he could muster having been\nexpended in paying his passage. I had fifteen pistoles; so he borrowed\noccasionally of me to subsist, while he was looking out for business. He\nfirst endeavored to get into the playhouse, believing himself qualify'd\nfor an actor; but Wilkes, to whom he apply'd, advis'd him candidly not\nto think of that employment, as it was impossible he should succeed in\nit. Then he propos'd to Roberts, a publisher in Paternoster Row, to\nwrite for him a weekly paper like the Spectator, on certain conditions,\nwhich Roberts did not approve. Then he endeavored to get employment as a\nhackney writer, to copy for the stationers and lawyers about the Temple,\nbut could find no vacancy.\n\nI immediately got into work at Palmer's, then a famous printing-house in\nBartholomew Close, and here I continu'd near a year. I was pretty\ndiligent, but spent with Ralph a good deal of my earnings in going to\nplays and other places of amusement. We had together consumed all my\npistoles, and now just rubbed on from hand to mouth. He seem'd quite to\nforget his wife and child, and I, by degrees, my engagements with Miss\nRead, to whom I never wrote more than one letter, and that was to let\nher know I was not likely soon to return. This was another of the great\nerrata of my life, which I should wish to correct if I were to live it\nover again. In fact, by our expenses, I was constantly kept unable to\npay my passage.\n\nAt Palmer's I was employed in composing for the second edition of\nWollaston's \"Religion of Nature.\" Some of his reasonings not appearing\nto me well founded, I wrote a little metaphysical piece in which I made\nremarks on them. It was entitled \"A Dissertation on Liberty and\nNecessity, Pleasure and Pain.\" I inscribed it to my friend Ralph; I\nprinted a small number. It occasion'd my being more consider'd by Mr.\nPalmer as a young man of some ingenuity, tho' he seriously expostulated\nwith me upon the principles of my pamphlet, which to him appear'd\nabominable. My printing this pamphlet was another erratum. While I\nlodg'd in Little Britain, I made an acquaintance with one Wilcox, a\nbookseller, whose shop was at the next door. He had an immense\ncollection of second-hand books. Circulating libraries were not then in\nuse; but we agreed that, on certain reasonable terms, which I have now\nforgotten, I might take, read, and return any of his books. This I\nesteem'd a great advantage, and I made as much use of it as I could.\n\nMy pamphlet by some means falling into the hands of one Lyons, a\nsurgeon, author of a book entitled \"The Infallibility of Human\nJudgment,\" it occasioned an acquaintance between us. He took great\nnotice of me, called on me often to converse on those subjects, carried\nme to the Horns, a pale alehouse in ------ Lane, Cheapside, and\nintroduced me to Dr. Mandeville, author of the \"Fable of the Bees,\" who\nhad a club there, of which he was the soul, being a most facetious,\nentertaining companion. Lyons, too, introduced me to Dr. Pemberton, at\nBatson's Coffee-house, who promis'd to give me an opportunity, some time\nor other, of seeing Sir Isaac Newton, of which I was extreamely\ndesirous; but this never happened.\n\nI had brought over a few curiosities, among which the principal was a\npurse made of the asbestos, which purifies by fire. Sir Hans Sloane\nheard of it, came to see me, and invited me to his house in Bloomsbury\nSquare, where he show'd me all his curiosities, and persuaded me to let\nhim add that to the number, for which he paid me handsomely.\n\nIn our house there lodg'd a young woman, a milliner, who, I think, had a\nshop in the Cloisters. She had been genteelly bred, was sensible and\nlively, and of most pleasing conversation. Ralph read plays to her in\nthe evenings, they grew intimate, she took another lodging, and he\nfollowed her. They liv'd together some time; but, he being still out of\nbusiness, and her income not sufficient to maintain them with her child,\nhe took a resolution of going from London, to try for a country school,\nwhich he thought himself well qualified to undertake, as he wrote an\nexcellent hand, and was a master of arithmetic and accounts. This,\nhowever, he deemed a business below him, and confident of future better\nfortune, when he should be unwilling to have it known that he once was\nso meanly employed, he changed his name, and did me the honor to assume\nmine; for I soon after had a letter from him, acquainting me that he was\nsettled in a small village (in Berkshire, I think it was, where he\ntaught reading and writing to ten or a dozen boys, at sixpence each per\nweek), recommending Mrs. T------ to my care, and desiring me to write to\nhim, directing for Mr. Franklin, schoolmaster, at such a place.\n\nHe continued to write frequently, sending me large specimens of an epic\npoem which he was then composing, and desiring my remarks and\ncorrections. These I gave him from time to time, but endeavor'd rather\nto discourage his proceeding. One of Young's Satires was then just\npublished. I copy'd and sent him a great part of it, which set in a\nstrong light the folly of pursuing the Muses with any hope of\nadvancement by them. All was in vain; sheets of the poem continued to\ncome by every post. In the mean time, Mrs. T------, having on his\naccount lost her friends and business, was often in distresses, and us'd\nto send for me, and borrow what I could spare to help her out of them. I\ngrew fond of her company, and, being at that time under no religious\nrestraint, and presuming upon my importance to her, I attempted\nfamiliarities (another erratum) which she repuls'd with a proper\nresentment, and acquainted him with my behaviour. This made a breach\nbetween us; and, when he returned again to London, he let me know he\nthought I had cancell'd all the obligations he had been under to me. So\nI found I was never to expect his repaying me what I lent to him, or\nadvanc'd for him. This, however, was not then of much consequence, as he\nwas totally unable; and in the loss of his friendship I found myself\nrelieved from a burthen. I now began to think of getting a little money\nbeforehand, and, expecting better work, I left Palmer's to work at\nWatts's, near Lincoln's Inn Fields, a still greater printing-house. Here\nI continued all the rest of my stay in London.\n\nAt my first admission into this printing-house I took to working at\npress, imagining I felt a want of the bodily exercise I had been us'd to\nin America, where presswork is mix'd with composing. I drank only water;\nthe other workmen, near fifty in number, were great guzzlers of beer. On\noccasion, I carried up and down stairs a large form of types in each\nhand, when others carried but one in both hands. They wondered to see,\nfrom this and several instances, that the Water-American, as they called\nme, was stronger than themselves, who drank strong beer! We had an\nalehouse boy who attended always in the house to supply the workmen. My\ncompanion at the press drank every day a pint before breakfast, a pint\nat breakfast with his bread and cheese, a pint between breakfast and\ndinner, a pint at dinner, a pint in the afternoon about six o'clock, and\nanother when he had done his day's work. I thought it a detestable\ncustom; but it was necessary, he suppos'd, to drink strong beer, that he\nmight be strong to labor. I endeavored to convince him that the bodily\nstrength afforded by beer could only be in proportion to the grain or\nflour of the barley dissolved in the water of which it was made; that\nthere was more flour in a pennyworth of bread; and therefore, if he\nwould eat that with a pint of water, it would give him more strength\nthan a quart of beer. He drank on, however, and had four or five\nshillings to pay out of his wages every Saturday night for that muddling\nliquor; an expense I was free from. And thus these poor devils keep\nthemselves always under.\n\nWatts, after some weeks, desiring to have me in the composing-room, I\nleft the pressmen; a new bien venu or sum for drink, being five\nshillings, was demanded of me by the compositors. I thought it an\nimposition, as I had paid below; the master thought so too, and forbad\nmy paying it. I stood out two or three weeks, was accordingly considered\nas an excommunicate, and had so many little pieces of private mischief\ndone me, by mixing my sorts, transposing my pages, breaking my matter,\netc., etc., if I were ever so little out of the room, and all ascribed\nto the chappel ghost, which they said ever haunted those not regularly\nadmitted, that, notwithstanding the master's protection, I found myself\noblig'd to comply and pay the money, convinc'd of the folly of being on\nill terms with those one is to live with continually.\n\nI was now on a fair footing with them, and soon acquir'd considerable\ninfluence. I propos'd some reasonable alterations in their chappel [4]\nlaws, and carried them against all opposition. From my example, a great\npart of them left their muddling breakfast of beer, and bread, and\ncheese, finding they could with me be suppli'd from a neighboring house\nwith a large porringer of hot water-gruel, sprinkled with pepper,\ncrumbl'd with bread, and a bit of butter in it, for the price of a pint\nof beer, viz., three half-pence. This was a more comfortable as well as\ncheaper breakfast, and kept their heads clearer. Those who continued\nsotting with beer all day, were often, by not paying, out of credit at\nthe alehouse, and us'd to make interest with me to get beer; their\nlight, as they phrased it, being out. I watch'd the pay-table on\nSaturday night, and collected what I stood engag'd for them, having to\npay sometimes near thirty shillings a week on their account. This, and\nmy being esteem'd a pretty good riggite, that is, a jocular verbal\nsatirist, supported my consequence in the society. My constant\nattendance (I never making a St. Monday) recommended me to the master;\nand my uncommon quickness at composing occasioned my being put upon all\nwork of dispatch, which was generally better paid. So I went on now very\nagreeably.\n\n[4] \"A printing-house is always called a chapel by the workmen, the\norigin of which appears to have been that printing was first carried on\nin England in an ancient chapel converted into a printing-house, and the\ntitle has been preserved by tradition. The bien venu among the printers\nanswers to the terms entrance and footing among mechanics; thus a\njourneyman, on entering a printing-house, was accustomed to pay one or\nmore gallons of beer for the good of the chapel; this custom was falling\ninto disuse thirty years ago; it is very properly rejected entirely in\nthe United States.\"--W. T. F.\n\nMy lodging in Little Britain being too remote, I found another in\nDuke-street, opposite to the Romish Chapel. It was two pair of stairs\nbackwards, at an Italian warehouse. A widow lady kept the house; she had\na daughter, and a maid servant, and a journeyman who attended the\nwarehouse, but lodg'd abroad. After sending to inquire my character at\nthe house where I last lodg'd she agreed to take me in at the same rate,\n3s. 6d. per week; cheaper, as she said, from the protection she expected\nin having a man lodge in the house. She was a widow, an elderly woman;\nhad been bred a Protestant, being a clergyman's daughter, but was\nconverted to the Catholic religion by her husband, whose memory she much\nrevered; had lived much among people of distinction, and knew a thousand\nanecdotes of them as far back as the times of Charles the Second. She\nwas lame in her knees with the gout, and, therefore, seldom stirred out\nof her room, so sometimes wanted company; and hers was so highly amusing\nto me, that I was sure to spend an evening with her whenever she desired\nit. Our supper was only half an anchovy each, on a very little strip of\nbread and butter, and half a pint of ale between us; but the\nentertainment was in her conversation. My always keeping good hours, and\ngiving little trouble in the family, made her unwilling to part with me;\nso that, when I talk'd of a lodging I had heard of, nearer my business,\nfor two shillings a week, which, intent as I now was on saving money,\nmade some difference, she bid me not think of it, for she would abate me\ntwo shillings a week for the future; so I remained with her at one\nshilling and sixpence as long as I staid in London.\n\nIn a garret of her house there lived a maiden lady of seventy, in the\nmost retired manner, of whom my landlady gave me this account: that she\nwas a Roman Catholic, had been sent abroad when young, and lodg'd in a\nnunnery with an intent of becoming a nun; but, the country not agreeing\nwith her, she returned to England, where, there being no nunnery, she\nhad vow'd to lead the life of a nun, as near as might be done in those\ncircumstances. Accordingly, she had given all her estate to charitable\nuses, reserving only twelve pounds a year to live on, and out of this\nsum she still gave a great deal in charity, living herself on\nwater-gruel only, and using no fire but to boil it. She had lived many\nyears in that garret, being permitted to remain there gratis by\nsuccessive Catholic tenants of the house below, as they deemed it a\nblessing to have her there. A priest visited her to confess her every\nday. \"I have ask'd her,\" says my landlady, \"how she, as she liv'd, could\npossibly find so much employment for a confessor?\" \"Oh,\" said she, \"it\nis impossible to avoid vain thoughts.\" I was permitted once to visit\nher. She was chearful and polite, and convers'd pleasantly. The room was\nclean, but had no other furniture than a matras, a table with a crucifix\nand book, a stool which she gave me to sit on, and a picture over the\nchimney of Saint Veronica displaying her handkerchief, with the\nmiraculous figure of Christ's bleeding face on it, which she explained\nto me with great seriousness. She look'd pale, but was never sick; and I\ngive it as another instance on how small an income life and health may\nbe supported.\n\nAt Watts's printing-house I contracted an acquaintance with an ingenious\nyoung man, one Wygate, who, having wealthy relations, had been better\neducated than most printers; was a tolerable Latinist, spoke French, and\nlov'd reading. I taught him and a friend of his to swim at twice going\ninto the river, and they soon became good swimmers. They introduc'd me\nto some gentlemen from the country, who went to Chelsea by water to see\nthe College and Don Saltero's curiosities. In our return, at the request\nof the company, whose curiosity Wygate had excited, I stripped and\nleaped into the river, and swam from near Chelsea to Blackfryar's,\nperforming on the way many feats of activity, both upon and under water,\nthat surpris'd and pleas'd those to whom they were novelties.\n\nI had from a child been ever delighted with this exercise, had studied\nand practis'd all Thevenot's motions and positions, added some of my\nown, aiming at the graceful and easy as well as the useful. All these I\ntook this occasion of exhibiting to the company, and was much flatter'd\nby their admiration; and Wygate, who was desirous of becoming a master,\ngrew more and more attach'd to me on that account, as well as from the\nsimilarity of our studies. He at length proposed to me travelling all\nover Europe together, supporting ourselves everywhere by working at our\nbusiness. I was once inclined to it; but, mentioning it to my good\nfriend Mr. Denham, with whom I often spent an hour when I had leisure,\nhe dissuaded me from it, advising me to think only of returning to\nPennsilvania, which he was now about to do.\n\nI must record one trait of this good man's character. He had formerly\nbeen in business at Bristol, but failed in debt to a number of people,\ncompounded and went to America. There, by a close application to\nbusiness as a merchant, he acquir'd a plentiful fortune in a few years.\nReturning to England in the ship with me, he invited his old creditors\nto an entertainment, at which he thank'd them for the easy composition\nthey had favored him with, and, when they expected nothing but the\ntreat, every man at the first remove found under his plate an order on a\nbanker for the full amount of the unpaid remainder with interest.\n\nHe now told me he was about to return to Philadelphia, and should carry\nover a great quantity of goods in order to open a store there. He\npropos'd to take me over as his clerk, to keep his books, in which he\nwould instruct me, copy his letters, and attend the store. He added\nthat, as soon as I should be acquainted with mercantile business, he\nwould promote me by sending me with a cargo of flour and bread, etc., to\nthe West Indies, and procure me commissions from others which would be\nprofitable; and, if I manag'd well, would establish me handsomely. The\nthing pleas'd me; for I was grown tired of London, remembered with\npleasure the happy months I had spent in Pennsylvania, and wish'd again\nto see it; therefore I immediately agreed on the terms of fifty pounds a\nyear, Pennsylvania money; less, indeed, than my present gettings as a\ncompositor, but affording a better prospect.\n\nI now took leave of printing, as I thought, for ever, and was daily\nemployed in my new business, going about with Mr. Denham among the\ntradesmen to purchase various articles, and seeing them pack'd up, doing\nerrands, calling upon workmen to dispatch, etc.; and, when all was on\nboard, I had a few days' leisure. On one of these days, I was, to my\nsurprise, sent for by a great man I knew only by name, a Sir William\nWyndham, and I waited upon him. He had heard by some means or other of\nmy swimming from Chelsea to Blackfriar's, and of my teaching Wygate and\nanother young man to swim in a few hours. He had two sons, about to set\nout on their travels; he wish'd to have them first taught swimming, and\nproposed to gratify me handsomely if I would teach them. They were not\nyet come to town, and my stay was uncertain, so I could not undertake\nit; but, from this incident, I thought it likely that, if I were to\nremain in England and open a swimming-school, I might get a good deal of\nmoney; and it struck me so strongly, that, had the overture been sooner\nmade me, probably I should not so soon have returned to America. After\nmany years, you and I had something of more importance to do with one of\nthese sons of Sir William Wyndham, become Earl of Egremont, which I\nshall mention in its place.\n\nThus I spent about eighteen months in London; most part of the time I\nwork'd hard at my business, and spent but little upon myself except in\nseeing plays and in books. My friend Ralph had kept me poor; he owed me\nabout twenty-seven pounds, which I was now never likely to receive; a\ngreat sum out of my small earnings! I lov'd him, notwithstanding, for he\nhad many amiable qualities. I had by no means improv'd my fortune; but I\nhad picked up some very ingenious acquaintance, whose conversation was\nof great advantage to me; and I had read considerably.\n\nWe sail'd from Gravesend on the 23d of July, 1726. For the incidents of\nthe voyage, I refer you to my Journal, where you will find them all\nminutely related. Perhaps the most important part of that journal is the\nplan [5] to be found in it, which I formed at sea, for regulating my\nfuture conduct in life. It is the more remarkable, as being formed when\nI was so young, and yet being pretty faithfully adhered to quite thro'\nto old age.\n\n[5] The \"Journal\" was printed by Sparks, from a copy made at Reading in\n1787. But it does not contain the Plan.--Ed.\n\nWe landed in Philadelphia on the 11th of October, where I found sundry\nalterations. Keith was no longer governor, being superseded by Major\nGordon. I met him walking the streets as a common citizen. He seem'd a\nlittle asham'd at seeing me, but pass'd without saying anything. I\nshould have been as much asham'd at seeing Miss Read, had not her\nfriends, despairing with reason of my return after the receipt of my\nletter, persuaded her to marry another, one Rogers, a potter, which was\ndone in my absence. With him, however, she was never happy, and soon\nparted from him, refusing to cohabit with him or bear his name, it being\nnow said that he had another wife. He was a worthless fellow, tho' an\nexcellent workman, which was the temptation to her friends. He got into\ndebt, ran away in 1727 or 1728, went to the West Indies, and died there.\nKeimer had got a better house, a shop well supply'd with stationery,\nplenty of new types, a number of hands, tho' none good, and seem'd to\nhave a great deal of business.\n\nMr. Denham took a store in Water-street, where we open'd our goods; I\nattended the business diligently, studied accounts, and grew, in a\nlittle time, expert at selling. We lodg'd and boarded together; he\ncounsell'd me as a father, having a sincere regard for me. I respected\nand lov'd him, and we might have gone on together very happy; but, in\nthe beginning of February, 1726-7, when I had just pass'd my\ntwenty-first year, we both were taken ill. My distemper was a pleurisy,\nwhich very nearly carried me off. I suffered a good deal, gave up the\npoint in my own mind, and was rather disappointed when I found myself\nrecovering, regretting, in some degree, that I must now, some time or\nother, have all that disagreeable work to do over again. I forget what\nhis distemper was; it held him a long time, and at length carried him\noff. He left me a small legacy in a nuncupative will, as a token of his\nkindness for me, and he left me once more to the wide world; for the\nstore was taken into the care of his executors, and my employment under\nhim ended.\n\nMy brother-in-law, Holmes, being now at Philadelphia, advised my return\nto my business; and Keimer tempted me, with an offer of large wages by\nthe year, to come and take the management of his printing-house, that he\nmight better attend his stationer's shop. I had heard a bad character of\nhim in London from his wife and her friends, and was not fond of having\nany more to do with him. I tri'd for farther employment as a merchant's\nclerk; but, not readily meeting with any, I clos'd again with Keimer. I\nfound in his house these hands: Hugh Meredith, a Welsh Pensilvanian,\nthirty years of age, bred to country work; honest, sensible, had a great\ndeal of solid observation, was something of a reader, but given to\ndrink. Stephen Potts, a young countryman of full age, bred to the same,\nof uncommon natural parts, and great wit and humor, but a little idle.\nThese he had agreed with at extream low wages per week, to be rais'd a\nshilling every three months, as they would deserve by improving in their\nbusiness; and the expectation of these high wages, to come on hereafter,\nwas what he had drawn them in with. Meredith was to work at press, Potts\nat book-binding, which he, by agreement, was to teach them, though he\nknew neither one nor t'other. John ------, a wild Irishman, brought up\nto no business, whose service, for four years, Keimer had purchased from\nthe captain of a ship; he, too, was to be made a pressman. George Webb,\nan Oxford scholar, whose time for four years he had likewise bought,\nintending him for a compositor, of whom more presently; and David Harry,\na country boy, whom he had taken apprentice.\n\nI soon perceiv'd that the intention of engaging me at wages so much\nhigher than he had been us'd to give, was, to have these raw, cheap\nhands form'd thro' me; and, as soon as I had instructed them, then they\nbeing all articled to him, he should be able to do without me. I went\non, however, very cheerfully, put his printing-house in order, which had\nbeen in great confusion, and brought his hands by degrees to mind their\nbusiness and to do it better.\n\nIt was an odd thing to find an Oxford scholar in the situation of a\nbought servant. He was not more than eighteen years of age, and gave me\nthis account of himself; that he was born in Gloucester, educated at a\ngrammar-school there, had been distinguish'd among the scholars for some\napparent superiority in performing his part, when they exhibited plays;\nbelong'd to the Witty Club there, and had written some pieces in prose\nand verse, which were printed in the Gloucester newspapers; thence he\nwas sent to Oxford; where he continued about a year, but not well\nsatisfi'd, wishing of all things to see London, and become a player. At\nlength, receiving his quarterly allowance of fifteen guineas, instead of\ndischarging his debts he walk'd out of town, hid his gown in a furze\nbush, and footed it to London, where, having no friend to advise him, he\nfell into bad company, soon spent his guineas, found no means of being\nintroduc'd among the players, grew necessitous, pawn'd his cloaths, and\nwanted bread. Walking the street very hungry, and not knowing what to do\nwith himself, a crimp's bill was put into his hand, offering immediate\nentertainment and encouragement to such as would bind themselves to\nserve in America. He went directly, sign'd the indentures, was put into\nthe ship, and came over, never writing a line to acquaint his friends\nwhat was become of him. He was lively, witty, good-natur'd, and a\npleasant companion, but idle, thoughtless, and imprudent to the last\ndegree.\n\nJohn, the Irishman, soon ran away; with the rest I began to live very\nagreeably, for they all respected me the more, as they found Keimer\nincapable of instructing them, and that from me they learned something\ndaily. We never worked on Saturday, that being Keimer's Sabbath, so I\nhad two days for reading. My acquaintance with ingenious people in the\ntown increased. Keimer himself treated me with great civility and\napparent regard, and nothing now made me uneasy but my debt to Vernon,\nwhich I was yet unable to pay, being hitherto but a poor œconomist. He,\nhowever, kindly made no demand of it.\n\nOur printing-house often wanted sorts, and there was no letter-founder\nin America; I had seen types cast at James's in London, but without much\nattention to the manner; however, I now contrived a mould, made use of\nthe letters we had as puncheons, struck the matrices in lead, And thus\nsupply'd in a pretty tolerable way all deficiencies. I also engrav'd\nseveral things on occasion; I made the ink; I was warehouseman, and\neverything, and, in short, quite a factotum.\n\nBut, however serviceable I might be, I found that my services became\nevery day of less importance, as the other hands improv'd in the\nbusiness; and, when Keimer paid my second quarter's wages, he let me\nknow that he felt them too heavy, and thought I should make an\nabatement. He grew by degrees less civil, put on more of the master,\nfrequently found fault, was captious, and seem'd ready for an\noutbreaking. I went on, nevertheless, with a good deal of patience,\nthinking that his encumber'd circumstances were partly the cause. At\nlength a trifle snapt our connections; for, a great noise happening near\nthe court-house, I put my head out of the window to see what was the\nmatter. Keimer, being in the street, look'd up and saw me, call'd out to\nme in a loud voice and angry tone to mind my business, adding some\nreproachful words, that nettled me the more for their publicity, all the\nneighbors who were looking out on the same occasion being witnesses how\nI was treated. He came up immediately into the printing-house, continu'd\nthe quarrel, high words pass'd on both sides, he gave me the quarter's\nwarning we had stipulated, expressing a wish that he had not been\noblig'd to so long a warning. I told him his wish was unnecessary, for I\nwould leave him that instant; and so, taking my hat, walk'd out of\ndoors, desiring Meredith, whom I saw below, to take care of some things\nI left, and bring them to my lodgings.\n\nMeredith came accordingly in the evening, when we talked my affair over.\nHe had conceiv'd a great regard for me, and was very unwilling that I\nshould leave the house while he remain'd in it. He dissuaded me from\nreturning to my native country, which I began to think of; he reminded\nme that Keimer was in debt for all he possess'd; that his creditors\nbegan to be uneasy; that he kept his shop miserably, sold often without\nprofit for ready money, and often trusted without keeping accounts; that\nhe must therefore fall, which would make a vacancy I might profit of. I\nobjected my want of money. He then let me know that his father had a\nhigh opinion of me, and, from some discourse that had pass'd between\nthem, he was sure would advance money to set us up, if I would enter\ninto partnership with him. \"My time,\" says he, \"will be out with Keimer\nin the spring; by that time we may have our press and types in from\nLondon. I am sensible I am no workman; if you like it, your skill in the\nbusiness shall be set against the stock I furnish, and we will share the\nprofits equally.\"\n\nThe proposal was agreeable, and I consented; his father was in town and\napprov'd of it; the more as he saw I had great influence with his son,\nhad prevail'd on him to abstain long from dram-drinking, and he hop'd\nmight break him off that wretched habit entirely, when we came to be so\nclosely connected. I gave an inventory to the father, who carry'd it to\na merchant; the things were sent for, the secret was to be kept till\nthey should arrive, and in the mean time I was to get work, if I could,\nat the other printing-house. But I found no vacancy there, and so\nremain'd idle a few days, when Keimer, on a prospect of being employ'd\nto print some paper money in New Jersey, which would require cuts and\nvarious types that I only could supply, and apprehending Bradford might\nengage me and get the jobb from him, sent me a very civil message, that\nold friends should not part for a few words, the effect of sudden\npassion, and wishing me to return. Meredith persuaded me to comply, as\nit would give more opportunity for his improvement under my daily\ninstructions; so I return'd, and we went on more smoothly than for some\ntime before. The New Jersey jobb was obtain'd, I contriv'd a copperplate\npress for it, the first that had been seen in the country; I cut several\nornaments and checks for the bills. We went together to Burlington,\nwhere I executed the whole to satisfaction; and he received so large a\nsum for the work as to be enabled thereby to keep his head much longer\nabove water.\n\nAt Burlington I made an acquaintance with many principal people of the\nprovince. Several of them had been appointed by the Assembly a committee\nto attend the press, and take care that no more bills were printed than\nthe law directed. They were therefore, by turns, constantly with us, and\ngenerally he who attended, brought with him a friend or two for company.\nMy mind having been much more improv'd by reading than Keimer's, I\nsuppose it was for that reason my conversation seem'd to be more valu'd.\nThey had me to their houses, introduced me to their friends, and show'd\nme much civility; while he, tho' the master, was a little neglected. In\ntruth, he was an odd fish; ignorant of common life, fond of rudely\nopposing receiv'd opinions, slovenly to extream dirtiness, enthusiastic\nin some points of religion, and a little knavish withal.\n\nWe continu'd there near three months; and by that time I could reckon\namong my acquired friends, Judge Allen, Samuel Bustill, the secretary of\nthe Province, Isaac Pearson, Joseph Cooper, and several of the Smiths,\nmembers of Assembly, and Isaac Decow, the surveyor-general. The latter\nwas a shrewd, sagacious old man, who told me that he began for himself,\nwhen young, by wheeling clay for the brick-makers, learned to write\nafter he was of age, carri'd the chain for surveyors, who taught him\nsurveying, and he had now by his industry, acquir'd a good estate; and\nsays he, \"I foresee that you will soon work this man out of business,\nand make a fortune in it at Philadelphia.\" He had not then the least\nintimation of my intention to set up there or anywhere. These friends\nwere afterwards of great use to me, as I occasionally was to some of\nthem. They all continued their regard for me as long as they lived.\n\nBefore I enter upon my public appearance in business, it may be well to\nlet you know the then state of my mind with regard to my principles and\nmorals, that you may see how far those influenc'd the future events of\nmy life. My parents had early given me religious impressions, and\nbrought me through my childhood piously in the Dissenting way. But I was\nscarce fifteen, when, after doubting by turns of several points, as I\nfound them disputed in the different books I read, I began to doubt of\nRevelation itself. Some books against Deism fell into my hands; they\nwere said to be the substance of sermons preached at Boyle's Lectures.\nIt happened that they wrought an effect on me quite contrary to what was\nintended by them; for the arguments of the Deists, which were quoted to\nbe refuted, appeared to me much stronger than the refutations; in short,\nI soon became a thorough Deist. My arguments perverted some others,\nparticularly Collins and Ralph; but, each of them having afterwards\nwrong'd me greatly without the least compunction, and recollecting\nKeith's conduct towards me (who was another freethinker), and my own\ntowards Vernon and Miss Read, which at times gave me great trouble, I\nbegan to suspect that this doctrine, tho' it might be true, was not very\nuseful. My London pamphlet, which had for its motto these lines of\nDryden:\n\n   \"Whatever is, is right. Though purblind man\n    Sees but a part o' the chain, the nearest link:\n    His eyes not carrying to the equal beam,\n    That poises all above;\"\n\nand from the attributes of God, his infinite wisdom, goodness and power,\nconcluded that nothing could possibly be wrong in the world, and that\nvice and virtue were empty distinctions, no such things existing,\nappear'd now not so clever a performance as I once thought it; and I\ndoubted whether some error had not insinuated itself unperceiv'd into my\nargument, so as to infect all that follow'd, as is common in\nmetaphysical reasonings.\n\nI grew convinc'd that truth, sincerity and integrity in dealings between\nman and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity of life; and I\nform'd written resolutions, which still remain in my journal book, to\npractice them ever while I lived. Revelation had indeed no weight with\nme, as such; but I entertain'd an opinion that, though certain actions\nmight not be bad because they were forbidden by it, or good because it\ncommanded them, yet probably these actions might be forbidden because\nthey were bad for us, or commanded because they were beneficial to us,\nin their own natures, all the circumstances of things considered. And\nthis persuasion, with the kind hand of Providence, or some guardian\nangel, or accidental favorable circumstances and situations, or all\ntogether, preserved me, thro' this dangerous time of youth, and the\nhazardous situations I was sometimes in among strangers, remote from the\neye and advice of my father, without any willful gross immorality or\ninjustice, that might have been expected from my want of religion. I say\nwillful, because the instances I have mentioned had something of\nnecessity in them, from my youth, inexperience, and the knavery of\nothers. I had therefore a tolerable character to begin the world with; I\nvalued it properly, and determin'd to preserve it.\n\nWe had not been long return'd to Philadelphia before the new types\narriv'd from London. We settled with Keimer, and left him by his consent\nbefore he heard of it. We found a house to hire near the market, and\ntook it. To lessen the rent, which was then but twenty-four pounds a\nyear, tho' I have since known it to let for seventy, we took in Thomas\nGodfrey, a glazier, and his family, who were to pay a considerable part\nof it to us, and we to board with them. We had scarce opened our letters\nand put our press in order, before George House, an acquaintance of\nmine, brought a countryman to us, whom he had met in the street\ninquiring for a printer. All our cash was now expended in the variety of\nparticulars we had been obliged to procure, and this countryman's five\nshillings, being our first-fruits, and coming so seasonably, gave me\nmore pleasure than any crown I have since earned; and the gratitude I\nfelt toward House has made me often more ready than perhaps I should\notherwise have been to assist young beginners.\n\nThere are croakers in every country, always boding its ruin. Such a one\nthen lived in Philadelphia; a person of note, an elderly man, with a\nwise look and a very grave manner of speaking; his name was Samuel\nMickle. This gentleman, a stranger to me, stopt one day at my door, and\nasked me if I was the young man who had lately opened a new\nprinting-house. Being answered in the affirmative, he said he was sorry\nfor me, because it was an expensive undertaking, and the expense would\nbe lost; for Philadelphia was a sinking place, the people already\nhalf-bankrupts, or near being so; all appearances to the contrary, such\nas new buildings and the rise of rents, being to his certain knowledge\nfallacious; for they were, in fact, among the things that would soon\nruin us. And he gave me such a detail of misfortunes now existing, or\nthat were soon to exist, that he left me half melancholy. Had I known\nhim before I engaged in this business, probably I never should have done\nit. This man continued to live in this decaying place, and to declaim in\nthe same strain, refusing for many years to buy a house there, because\nall was going to destruction; and at last I had the pleasure of seeing\nhim give five times as much for one as he might have bought it for when\nhe first began his croaking.\n\nI should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the preceding\nyear, I had form'd most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of\nmutual improvement, which we called the Junto; we met on Friday\nevenings. The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his\nturn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals,\nPolitics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss'd by the company; and\nonce in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, on\nany subject he pleased. Our debates were to be under the direction of a\npresident, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after\ntruth, without fondness for dispute, or desire of victory; and, to\nprevent warmth, all expressions of positiveness in opinions, or direct\ncontradiction, were after some time made contraband, and prohibited\nunder small pecuniary penalties.\n\nThe first members were Joseph Breintnal, a copyer of deeds for the\nscriveners, a good-natur'd, friendly, middle-ag'd man, a great lover of\npoetry, reading all he could meet with, and writing some that was\ntolerable; very ingenious in many little Nicknackeries, and of sensible\nconversation.\n\nThomas Godfrey, a self-taught mathematician, great in his way, and\nafterward inventor of what is now called Hadley's Quadrant. But he knew\nlittle out of his way, and was not a pleasing companion; as, like most\ngreat mathematicians I have met with, he expected universal precision in\neverything said, or was for ever denying or distinguishing upon trifles,\nto the disturbance of all conversation. He soon left us.\n\nNicholas Scull, a surveyor, afterwards surveyor-general, who lov'd\nbooks, and sometimes made a few verses.\n\nWilliam Parsons, bred a shoemaker, but loving reading, had acquir'd a\nconsiderable share of mathematics, which he first studied with a view to\nastrology, that he afterwards laught at it. He also became\nsurveyor-general.\n\nWilliam Maugridge, a joiner, a most exquisite mechanic, and a solid,\nsensible man.\n\nHugh Meredith, Stephen Potts, and George Webb I have characteriz'd\nbefore.\n\nRobert Grace, a young gentleman of some fortune, generous, lively, and\nwitty; a lover of punning and of his friends.\n\nAnd William Coleman, then a merchant's clerk, about my age, who had the\ncoolest, clearest head, the best heart, and the exactest morals of\nalmost any man I ever met with. He became afterwards a merchant of great\nnote, and one of our provincial judges. Our friendship continued without\ninterruption to his death, upward of forty years; and the club continued\nalmost as long, and was the best school of philosophy, morality, and\npolitics that then existed in the province; for our queries, which were\nread the week preceding their discussion, put us upon reading with\nattention upon the several subjects, that we might speak more to the\npurpose; and here, too, we acquired better habits of conversation, every\nthing being studied in our rules which might prevent our disgusting each\nother. From hence the long continuance of the club, which I shall have\nfrequent occasion to speak further of hereafter.\n\nBut my giving this account of it here is to show something of the\ninterest I had, every one of these exerting themselves in recommending\nbusiness to us. Breintnal particularly procur'd us from the Quakers the\nprinting forty sheets of their history, the rest being to be done by\nKeimer; and upon this we work'd exceedingly hard, for the price was low.\nIt was a folio, pro patria size, in pica, with long primer notes. I\ncompos'd of it a sheet a day, and Meredith worked it off at press; it\nwas often eleven at night, and sometimes later, before I had finished my\ndistribution for the next day's work, for the little jobbs sent in by\nour other friends now and then put us back. But so determin'd I was to\ncontinue doing a sheet a day of the folio, that one night, when, having\nimpos'd my forms, I thought my day's work over, one of them by accident\nwas broken, and two pages reduced to pi, I immediately distributed and\ncompos'd it over again before I went to bed; and this industry, visible\nto our neighbors, began to give us character and credit; particularly, I\nwas told, that mention being made of the new printing-office at the\nmerchants' Every-night club, the general opinion was that it must fail,\nthere being already two printers in the place, Keimer and Bradford; but\nDr. Baird (whom you and I saw many years after at his native place, St.\nAndrew's in Scotland) gave a contrary opinion: \"For the industry of that\nFranklin,\" says he, \"is superior to any thing I ever saw of the kind; I\nsee him still at work when I go home from club, and he is at work again\nbefore his neighbors are out of bed.\" This struck the rest, and we soon\nafter had offers from one of them to supply us with stationery; but as\nyet we did not chuse to engage in shop business.\n\nI mention this industry the more particularly and the more freely, tho'\nit seems to be talking in my own praise, that those of my posterity, who\nshall read it, may know the use of that virtue, when they see its\neffects in my favour throughout this relation.\n\nGeorge Webb, who had found a female friend that lent him wherewith to\npurchase his time of Keimer, now came to offer himself as a journeyman\nto us. We could not then imploy him; but I foolishly let him know as a\nsecret that I soon intended to begin a newspaper, and might then have\nwork for him. My hopes of success, as I told him, were founded on this,\nthat the then only newspaper, printed by Bradford, was a paltry thing,\nwretchedly manag'd, no way entertaining, and yet was profitable to him;\nI therefore thought a good paper would scarcely fail of good\nencouragement. I requested Webb not to mention it; but he told it to\nKeimer, who immediately, to be beforehand with me, published proposals\nfor printing one himself, on which Webb was to be employ'd. I resented\nthis; and, to counteract them, as I could not yet begin our paper, I\nwrote several pieces of entertainment for Bradford's paper, under the\ntitle of the Busy Body, which Breintnal continu'd some months. By this\nmeans the attention of the publick was fixed on that paper, and Keimer's\nproposals, which we burlesqu'd and ridicul'd, were disregarded. He began\nhis paper, however, and, after carrying it on three quarters of a year,\nwith at most only ninety subscribers, he offered it to me for a trifle;\nand I, having been ready some time to go on with it, took it in hand\ndirectly; and it prov'd in a few years extremely profitable to me.\n\nI perceive that I am apt to speak in the singular number, though our\npartnership still continu'd; the reason may be that, in fact, the whole\nmanagement of the business lay upon me. Meredith was no compositor, a\npoor pressman, and seldom sober. My friends lamented my connection with\nhim, but I was to make the best of it.\n\nOur first papers made a quite different appearance from any before in\nthe province; a better type, and better printed; but some spirited\nremarks of my writing, on the dispute then going on between Governor\nBurnet and the Massachusetts Assembly, struck the principal people,\noccasioned the paper and the manager of it to be much talk'd of, and in\na few weeks brought them all to be our subscribers.\n\nTheir example was follow'd by many, and our number went on growing\ncontinually. This was one of the first good effects of my having learnt\na little to scribble; another was, that the leading men, seeing a\nnewspaper now in the hands of one who could also handle a pen, thought\nit convenient to oblige and encourage me. Bradford still printed the\nvotes, and laws, and other publick business. He had printed an address\nof the House to the governor, in a coarse, blundering manner, we\nreprinted it elegantly and correctly, and sent one to every member. They\nwere sensible of the difference: it strengthened the hands of our\nfriends in the House, and they voted us their printers for the year\nensuing.\n\nAmong my friends in the House I must not forget Mr. Hamilton, before\nmentioned, who was then returned from England, and had a seat in it. He\ninterested himself for me strongly in that instance, as he did in many\nothers afterward, continuing his patronage till his death. [6]\n\n[6] I got his son once £500.--[Marg. note.]\n\nMr. Vernon, about this time, put me in mind of the debt I ow'd him, but\ndid not press me. I wrote him an ingenuous letter of acknowledgment,\ncrav'd his forbearance a little longer, which he allow'd me, and as soon\nas I was able, I paid the principal with interest, and many thanks; so\nthat erratum was in some degree corrected.\n\nBut now another difficulty came upon me which I had never the least\nreason to expect. Mr. Meredith's father, who was to have paid for our\nprinting-house, according to the expectations given me, was able to\nadvance only one hundred pounds currency, which had been paid; and a\nhundred more was due to the merchant, who grew impatient, and su'd us\nall. We gave bail, but saw that, if the money could not be rais'd in\ntime, the suit must soon come to a judgment and execution, and our\nhopeful prospects must, with us, be ruined, as the press and letters\nmust be sold for payment, perhaps at half price.\n\nIn this distress two true friends, whose kindness I have never\nforgotten, nor ever shall forget while I can remember any thing, came to\nme separately, unknown to each other, and, without any application from\nme, offering each of them to advance me all the money that should be\nnecessary to enable me to take the whole business upon myself, if that\nshould be practicable; but they did not like my continuing the\npartnership with Meredith, who, as they said, was often seen drunk in\nthe streets, and playing at low games in alehouses, much to our\ndiscredit. These two friends were William Coleman and Robert Grace. I\ntold them I could not propose a separation while any prospect remain'd\nof the Merediths' fulfilling their part of our agreement, because I\nthought myself under great obligations to them for what they had done,\nand would do if they could; but, if they finally fail'd in their\nperformance, and our partnership must be dissolv'd, I should then think\nmyself at liberty to accept the assistance of my friends.\n\nThus the matter rested for some time, when I said to my partner,\n\"Perhaps your father is dissatisfied at the part you have undertaken in\nthis affair of ours, and is unwilling to advance for you and me what he\nwould for you alone. If that is the case, tell me, and I will resign the\nwhole to you, and go about my business.\" \"No,\" said he, \"my father has\nreally been disappointed, and is really unable; and I am unwilling to\ndistress him farther. I see this is a business I am not fit for. I was\nbred a farmer, and it was a folly in me to come to town, and put myself,\nat thirty years of age, an apprentice to learn a new trade. Many of our\nWelsh people are going to settle in North Carolina, where land is cheap.\nI am inclin'd to go with them, and follow my old employment. You may\nfind friends to assist you. If you will take the debts of the company\nupon you; return to my father the hundred pound he has advanced; pay my\nlittle personal debts, and give me thirty pounds and a new saddle, I\nwill relinquish the partnership, and leave the whole in your hands.\" I\nagreed to this proposal: it was drawn up in writing, sign'd, and seal'd\nimmediately. I gave him what he demanded, and he went soon after to\nCarolina, from whence he sent me next year two long letters, containing\nthe best account that had been given of that country, the climate, the\nsoil, husbandry, etc., for in those matters he was very judicious. I\nprinted them in the papers, and they gave great satisfaction to the\npublick.\n\nAs soon as he was gone, I recurr'd to my two friends; and because I\nwould not give an unkind preference to either, I took half of what each\nhad offered and I wanted of one, and half of the other; paid off the\ncompany's debts, and went on with the business in my own name,\nadvertising that the partnership was dissolved. I think this was in or\nabout the year 1729.\n\nAbout this time there was a cry among the people for more paper money,\nonly fifteen thousand pounds being extant in the province, and that soon\nto be sunk. The wealthy inhabitants oppos'd any addition, being against\nall paper currency, from an apprehension that it would depreciate, as it\nhad done in New England, to the prejudice of all creditors. We had\ndiscuss'd this point in our Junto, where I was on the side of an\naddition, being persuaded that the first small sum struck in 1723 had\ndone much good by increasing the trade, employment, and number of\ninhabitants in the province, since I now saw all the old houses\ninhabited, and many new ones building: whereas I remembered well, that\nwhen I first walk'd about the streets of Philadelphia, eating my roll, I\nsaw most of the houses in Walnut-street, between Second and Front\nstreets, with bills on their doors, \"To be let\"; and many likewise in\nChestnut-street and other streets, which made me then think the\ninhabitants of the city were deserting it one after another.\n\nOur debates possess'd me so fully of the subject, that I wrote and\nprinted an anonymous pamphlet on it, entitled \"The Nature and Necessity\nof a Paper Currency.\" It was well receiv'd by the common people in\ngeneral; but the rich men dislik'd it, for it increas'd and strengthen'd\nthe clamor for more money, and they happening to have no writers among\nthem that were able to answer it, their opposition slacken'd, and the\npoint was carried by a majority in the House. My friends there, who\nconceiv'd I had been of some service, thought fit to reward me by\nemploying me in printing the money; a very profitable jobb and a great\nhelp to me. This was another advantage gain'd by my being able to write.\n\nThe utility of this currency became by time and experience so evident as\nnever afterwards to be much disputed; so that it grew soon to fifty-five\nthousand pounds, and in 1739 to eighty thousand pounds, since which it\narose during war to upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand pounds,\ntrade, building, and inhabitants all the while increasing, tho' I now\nthink there are limits beyond which the quantity may be hurtful.\n\nI soon after obtain'd, thro' my friend Hamilton, the printing of the\nNewcastle paper money, another profitable jobb as I then thought it;\nsmall things appearing great to those in small circumstances; and these,\nto me, were really great advantages, as they were great encouragements.\nHe procured for me, also, the printing of the laws and votes of that\ngovernment, which continu'd in my hands as long as I follow'd the\nbusiness.\n\nI now open'd a little stationer's shop. I had in it blanks of all sorts,\nthe correctest that ever appear'd among us, being assisted in that by my\nfriend Breintnal. I had also paper, parchment, chapmen's books, etc. One\nWhitemash, a compositor I had known in London, an excellent workman, now\ncame to me, and work'd with me constantly and diligently; and I took an\napprentice, the son of Aquila Rose.\n\nI began now gradually to pay off the debt I was under for the\nprinting-house. In order to secure my credit and character as a\ntradesman, I took care not only to be in reality industrious and frugal,\nbut to avoid all appearances to the contrary. I drest plainly; I was\nseen at no places of idle diversion. I never went out a fishing or\nshooting; a book, indeed, sometimes debauch'd me from my work, but that\nwas seldom, snug, and gave no scandal; and, to show that I was not above\nmy business, I sometimes brought home the paper I purchas'd at the\nstores thro' the streets on a wheelbarrow. Thus being esteem'd an\nindustrious, thriving young man, and paying duly for what I bought, the\nmerchants who imported stationery solicited my custom; others proposed\nsupplying me with books, and I went on swimmingly. In the mean time,\nKeimer's credit and business declining daily, he was at last forc'd to\nsell his printing-house to satisfy his creditors. He went to Barbadoes,\nand there lived some years in very poor circumstances.\n\nHis apprentice, David Harry, whom I had instructed while I work'd with\nhim, set up in his place at Philadelphia, having bought his materials. I\nwas at first apprehensive of a powerful rival in Harry, as his friends\nwere very able, and had a good deal of interest. I therefore propos'd a\npartnership to him which he, fortunately for me, rejected with scorn. He\nwas very proud, dress'd like a gentleman, liv'd expensively, took much\ndiversion and pleasure abroad, ran in debt, and neglected his business;\nupon which, all business left him; and, finding nothing to do, he\nfollowed Keimer to Barbadoes, taking the printing-house with him. There\nthis apprentice employ'd his former master as a journeyman; they\nquarrel'd often; Harry went continually behindhand, and at length was\nforc'd to sell his types and return to his country work in Pensilvania.\nThe person that bought them employ'd Keimer to use them, but in a few\nyears he died.\n\nThere remained now no competitor with me at Philadelphia but the old\none, Bradford; who was rich and easy, did a little printing now and then\nby straggling hands, but was not very anxious about the business.\nHowever, as he kept the post-office, it was imagined he had better\nopportunities of obtaining news; his paper was thought a better\ndistributer of advertisements than mine, and therefore had many more,\nwhich was a profitable thing to him, and a disadvantage to me; for, tho'\nI did indeed receive and send papers by the post, yet the publick\nopinion was otherwise, for what I did send was by bribing the riders,\nwho took them privately, Bradford being unkind enough to forbid it,\nwhich occasion'd some resentment on my part; and I thought so meanly of\nhim for it, that, when I afterward came into his situation, I took care\nnever to imitate it.\n\nI had hitherto continu'd to board with Godfrey, who lived in part of my\nhouse with his wife and children, and had one side of the shop for his\nglazier's business, tho' he worked little, being always absorbed in his\nmathematics. Mrs. Godfrey projected a match for me with a relation's\ndaughter, took opportunities of bringing us often together, till a\nserious courtship on my part ensu'd, the girl being in herself very\ndeserving. The old folks encourag'd me by continual invitations to\nsupper, and by leaving us together, till at length it was time to\nexplain. Mrs. Godfrey manag'd our little treaty. I let her know that I\nexpected as much money with their daughter as would pay off my remaining\ndebt for the printing-house, which I believe was not then above a\nhundred pounds. She brought me word they had no such sum to spare; I\nsaid they might mortgage their house in the loan-office. The answer to\nthis, after some days, was, that they did not approve the match; that,\non inquiry of Bradford, they had been inform'd the printing business was\nnot a profitable one; the types would soon be worn out, and more wanted;\nthat S. Keimer and D. Harry had failed one after the other, and I should\nprobably soon follow them; and, therefore, I was forbidden the house,\nand the daughter shut up.\n\nWhether this was a real change of sentiment or only artifice, on a\nsupposition of our being too far engaged in affection to retract, and\ntherefore that we should steal a marriage, which would leave them at\nliberty to give or withhold what they pleas'd, I know not; but I\nsuspected the latter, resented it, and went no more. Mrs. Godfrey\nbrought me afterward some more favorable accounts of their disposition,\nand would have drawn me on again; but I declared absolutely my\nresolution to have nothing more to do with that family. This was\nresented by the Godfreys; we differ'd, and they removed, leaving me the\nwhole house, and I resolved to take no more inmates.\n\nBut this affair having turned my thoughts to marriage, I look'd round me\nand made overtures of acquaintance in other places; but soon found that,\nthe business of a printer being generally thought a poor one, I was not\nto expect money with a wife, unless with such a one as I should not\notherwise think agreeable. In the mean time, that hard-to-be-governed\npassion of youth hurried me frequently into intrigues with low women\nthat fell in my way, which were attended with some expense and great\ninconvenience, besides a continual risque to my health by a distemper\nwhich of all things I dreaded, though by great good luck I escaped it. A\nfriendly correspondence as neighbors and old acquaintances had continued\nbetween me and Mrs. Read's family, who all had a regard for me from the\ntime of my first lodging in their house. I was often invited there and\nconsulted in their affairs, wherein I sometimes was of service. I piti'd\npoor Miss Read's unfortunate situation, who was generally dejected,\nseldom cheerful, and avoided company. I considered my giddiness and\ninconstancy when in London as in a great degree the cause of her\nunhappiness, tho' the mother was good enough to think the fault more her\nown than mine, as she had prevented our marrying before I went thither,\nand persuaded the other match in my absence. Our mutual affection was\nrevived, but there were now great objections to our union. The match was\nindeed looked upon as invalid, a preceding wife being said to be living\nin England; but this could not easily be prov'd, because of the\ndistance; and, tho' there was a report of his death, it was not certain.\nThen, tho' it should be true, he had left many debts, which his\nsuccessor might be call'd upon to pay. We ventured, however, over all\nthese difficulties, and I took her to wife, September 1st, 1730. None of\nthe inconveniences happened that we had apprehended; she proved a good\nand faithful helpmate, assisted me much by attending the shop; we throve\ntogether, and have ever mutually endeavored to make each other happy.\nThus I corrected that great erratum as well as I could.\n\nAbout this time, our club meeting, not at a tavern, but in a little room\nof Mr. Grace's, set apart for that purpose, a proposition was made by\nme, that, since our books were often referr'd to in our disquisitions\nupon the queries, it might be convenient to us to have them altogether\nwhere we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted; and by thus\nclubbing our books to a common library, we should, while we lik'd to\nkeep them together, have each of us the advantage of using the books of\nall the other members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each\nowned the whole. It was lik'd and agreed to, and we fill'd one end of\nthe room with such books as we could best spare. The number was not so\ngreat as we expected; and tho' they had been of great use, yet some\ninconveniences occurring for want of due care of them, the collection,\nafter about a year, was separated, and each took his books home again.\n\nAnd now I set on foot my first project of a public nature, that for a\nsubscription library. I drew up the proposals, got them put into form by\nour great scrivener, Brockden, and, by the help of my friends in the\nJunto, procured fifty subscribers of forty shillings each to begin with,\nand ten shillings a year for fifty years, the term our company was to\ncontinue. We afterwards obtain'd a charter, the company being increased\nto one hundred: this was the mother of all the North American\nsubscription libraries, now so numerous. It is become a great thing\nitself, and continually increasing. These libraries have improved the\ngeneral conversation of the Americans, made the common tradesmen and\nfarmers as intelligent as most gentlemen from other countries, and\nperhaps have contributed in some degree to the stand so generally made\nthroughout the colonies in defense of their privileges.\n\nMemo. Thus far was written with the intention express'd in the beginning\nand therefore contains several little family anecdotes of no importance\nto others. What follows was written many years after in compliance with\nthe advice contain'd in these letters, and accordingly intended for the\npublic. The affairs of the Revolution occasion'd the interruption.\n\nLetter from Mr. Abel James,\nwith Notes of my Life (received in Paris).\n\n\"My Dear and Honored Friend: I have often been desirous of writing to\nthee, but could not be reconciled to the thought that the letter might\nfall into the hands of the British, lest some printer or busy-body\nshould publish some part of the contents, and give our friend pain, and\nmyself censure.\n\n\"Some time since there fell into my hands, to my great joy, about\ntwenty-three sheets in thy own handwriting, containing an account of the\nparentage and life of thyself, directed to thy son, ending in the year\n1730, with which there were notes, likewise in thy writing; a copy of\nwhich I inclose, in hopes it may be a means, if thou continued it up to\na later period, that the first and latter part may be put together; and\nif it is not yet continued, I hope thee will not delay it. Life is\nuncertain, as the preacher tells us; and what will the world say if\nkind, humane, and benevolent Ben. Franklin should leave his friends and\nthe world deprived of so pleasing and profitable a work; a work which\nwould be useful and entertaining not only to a few, but to millions? The\ninfluence writings under that class have on the minds of youth is very\ngreat, and has nowhere appeared to me so plain, as in our public\nfriend's journals. It almost insensibly leads the youth into the\nresolution of endeavoring to become as good and eminent as the\njournalist. Should thine, for instance, when published (and I think it\ncould not fail of it), lead the youth to equal the industry and\ntemperance of thy early youth, what a blessing with that class would\nsuch a work be! I know of no character living, nor many of them put\ntogether, who has so much in his power as thyself to promote a greater\nspirit of industry and early attention to business, frugality, and\ntemperance with the American youth. Not that I think the work would have\nno other merit and use in the world, far from it; but the first is of\nsuch vast importance that I know nothing that can equal it.\"\n\nThe foregoing letter and the minutes accompanying it being shown to a\nfriend, I received from him the following:\n\nLetter from Mr. Benjamin Vaughan.\n\n\"Paris, January 31, 1783.\n\n\"My Dearest Sir: When I had read over your sheets of minutes of the\nprincipal incidents of your life, recovered for you by your Quaker\nacquaintance, I told you I would send you a letter expressing my reasons\nwhy I thought it would be useful to complete and publish it as he\ndesired. Various concerns have for some time past prevented this letter\nbeing written, and I do not know whether it was worth any expectation;\nhappening to be at leisure, however, at present, I shall by writing, at\nleast interest and instruct myself; but as the terms I am inclined to\nuse may tend to offend a person of your manners, I shall only tell you\nhow I would address any other person, who was as good and as great as\nyourself, but less diffident. I would say to him, Sir, I solicit the\nhistory of your life from the following motives: Your history is so\nremarkable, that if you do not give it, somebody else will certainly\ngive it; and perhaps so as nearly to do as much harm, as your own\nmanagement of the thing might do good. It will moreover present a table\nof the internal circumstances of your country, which will very much tend\nto invite to it settlers of virtuous and manly minds. And considering\nthe eagerness with which such information is sought by them, and the\nextent of your reputation, I do not know of a more efficacious\nadvertisement than your biography would give. All that has happened to\nyou is also connected with the detail of the manners and situation of a\nrising people; and in this respect I do not think that the writings of\nCæsar and Tacitus can be more interesting to a true judge of human\nnature and society. But these, sir, are small reasons, in my opinion,\ncompared with the chance which your life will give for the forming of\nfuture great men; and in conjunction with your Art of Virtue (which you\ndesign to publish) of improving the features of private character, and\nconsequently of aiding all happiness, both public and domestic. The two\nworks I allude to, sir, will in particular give a noble rule and example\nof self-education. School and other education constantly proceed upon\nfalse principles, and show a clumsy apparatus pointed at a false mark;\nbut your apparatus is simple, and the mark a true one; and while parents\nand young persons are left destitute of other just means of estimating\nand becoming prepared for a reasonable course in life, your discovery\nthat the thing is in many a man's private power, will be invaluable!\nInfluence upon the private character, late in life, is not only an\ninfluence late in life, but a weak influence. It is in youth that we\nplant our chief habits and prejudices; it is in youth that we take our\nparty as to profession, pursuits and matrimony. In youth, therefore, the\nturn is given; in youth the education even of the next generation is\ngiven; in youth the private and public character is determined; and the\nterm of life extending but from youth to age, life ought to begin well\nfrom youth, and more especially before we take our party as to our\nprincipal objects. But your biography will not merely teach\nself-education, but the education of a wise man; and the wisest man will\nreceive lights and improve his progress, by seeing detailed the conduct\nof another wise man. And why are weaker men to be deprived of such\nhelps, when we see our race has been blundering on in the dark, almost\nwithout a guide in this particular, from the farthest trace of time?\nShow then, sir, how much is to be done, both to sons and fathers; and\ninvite all wise men to become like yourself, and other men to become\nwise. When we see how cruel statesmen and warriors can be to the human\nrace, and how absurd distinguished men can be to their acquaintance, it\nwill be instructive to observe the instances multiply of pacific,\nacquiescing manners; and to find how compatible it is to be great and\ndomestic, enviable and yet good-humored.\n\n\"The little private incidents which you will also have to relate, will\nhave considerable use, as we want, above all things, rules of prudence\nin ordinary affairs; and it will be curious to see how you have acted in\nthese. It will be so far a sort of key to life, and explain many things\nthat all men ought to have once explained to them, to give them a chance\nof becoming wise by foresight. The nearest thing to having experience of\none's own, is to have other people's affairs brought before us in a\nshape that is interesting; this is sure to happen from your pen; our\naffairs and management will have an air of simplicity or importance that\nwill not fail to strike; and I am convinced you have conducted them with\nas much originality as if you had been conducting discussions in\npolitics or philosophy; and what more worthy of experiments and system\n(its importance and its errors considered) than human life?\n\n\"Some men have been virtuous blindly, others have speculated\nfantastically, and others have been shrewd to bad purposes; but you,\nsir, I am sure, will give under your hand, nothing but what is at the\nsame moment, wise, practical and good.  Your account of yourself (for I\nsuppose the parallel I am drawing for Dr. Franklin, will hold not only\nin point of character, but of private history) will show that you are\nashamed of no origin; a thing the more important, as you prove how\nlittle necessary all origin is to happiness, virtue, or greatness. As no\nend likewise happens without a means, so we shall find, sir, that even\nyou yourself framed a plan by which you became considerable; but at the\nsame time we may see that though the event is flattering, the means are\nas simple as wisdom could make them; that is, depending upon nature,\nvirtue, thought and habit. Another thing demonstrated will be the\npropriety of every man's waiting for his time for appearing upon the\nstage of the world. Our sensations being very much fixed to the moment,\nwe are apt to forget that more moments are to follow the first, and\nconsequently that man should arrange his conduct so as to suit the whole\nof a life. Your attribution appears to have been applied to your life,\nand the passing moments of it have been enlivened with content and\nenjoyment, instead of being tormented with foolish impatience or\nregrets. Such a conduct is easy for those who make virtue and themselves\nin countenance by examples of other truly great men, of whom patience is\nso often the characteristic. Your Quaker correspondent, sir (for here\nagain I will suppose the subject of my letter resembling Dr. Franklin),\npraised your frugality, diligence and temperance, which he considered as\na pattern for all youth; but it is singular that he should have\nforgotten your modesty and your disinterestedness, without which you\nnever could have waited for your advancement, or found your situation in\nthe mean time comfortable; which is a strong lesson to show the poverty\nof glory and the importance of regulating our minds. If this\ncorrespondent had known the nature of your reputation as well as I do,\nhe would have said, Your former writings and measures would secure\nattention to your Biography, and Art of Virtue; and your Biography and\nArt of Virtue, in return, would secure attention to them. This is an\nadvantage attendant upon a various character, and which brings all that\nbelongs to it into greater play; and it is the more useful, as perhaps\nmore persons are at a loss for the means of improving their minds and\ncharacters, than they are for the time or the inclination to do it. But\nthere is one concluding reflection, sir, that will shew the use of your\nlife as a mere piece of biography. This style of writing seems a little\ngone out of vogue, and yet it is a very useful one; and your specimen of\nit may be particularly serviceable, as it will make a subject of\ncomparison with the lives of various public cutthroats and intriguers,\nand with absurd monastic self-tormentors or vain literary triflers. If\nit encourages more writings of the same kind with your own, and induces\nmore men to spend lives fit to be written, it will be worth all\nPlutarch's Lives put together. But being tired of figuring to myself a\ncharacter of which every feature suits only one man in the world,\nwithout giving him the praise of it, I shall end my letter, my dear Dr.\nFranklin, with a personal application to your proper self. I am\nearnestly desirous, then, my dear sir, that you should let the world\ninto the traits of your genuine character, as civil broils may otherwise\ntend to disguise or traduce it. Considering your great age, the caution\nof your character, and your peculiar style of thinking, it is not likely\nthat any one besides yourself can be sufficiently master of the facts of\nyour life, or the intentions of your mind. Besides all this, the immense\nrevolution of the present period, will necessarily turn our attention\ntowards the author of it, and when virtuous principles have been\npretended in it, it will be highly important to shew that such have\nreally influenced; and, as your own character will be the principal one\nto receive a scrutiny, it is proper (even for its effects upon your vast\nand rising country, as well as upon England and upon Europe) that it\nshould stand respectable and eternal. For the furtherance of human\nhappiness, I have always maintained that it is necessary to prove that\nman is not even at present a vicious and detestable animal; and still\nmore to prove that good management may greatly amend him; and it is for\nmuch the same reason, that I am anxious to see the opinion established,\nthat there are fair characters existing among the individuals of the\nrace; for the moment that all men, without exception, shall be conceived\nabandoned, good people will cease efforts deemed to be hopeless, and\nperhaps think of taking their share in the scramble of life, or at least\nof making it comfortable principally for themselves. Take then, my dear\nsir, this work most speedily into hand: shew yourself good as you are\ngood; temperate as you are temperate; and above all things, prove\nyourself as one, who from your infancy have loved justice, liberty and\nconcord, in a way that has made it natural and consistent for you to\nhave acted, as we have seen you act in the last seventeen years of your\nlife. Let Englishmen be made not only to respect, but even to love you.\nWhen they think well of individuals in your native country, they will go\nnearer to thinking well of your country; and when your countrymen see\nthemselves well thought of by Englishmen, they will go nearer to\nthinking well of England. Extend your views even further; do not stop at\nthose who speak the English tongue, but after having settled so many\npoints in nature and politics, think of bettering the whole race of men.\nAs I have not read any part of the life in question, but know only the\ncharacter that lived it, I write somewhat at hazard. I am sure, however,\nthat the life and the treatise I allude to (on the Art of Virtue) will\nnecessarily fulfil the chief of my expectations; and still more so if\nyou take up the measure of suiting these performances to the several\nviews above stated. Should they even prove unsuccessful in all that a\nsanguine admirer of yours hopes from them, you will at least have framed\npieces to interest the human mind; and whoever gives a feeling of\npleasure that is innocent to man, has added so much to the fair side of\na life otherwise too much darkened by anxiety and too much injured by\npain. In the hope, therefore, that you will listen to the prayer\naddressed to you in this letter, I beg to subscribe myself, my dearest\nsir, etc., etc.,\n\n\"Signed,     Benj. Vaughan.\"\n\nContinuation of the Account of my Life, begun at Passy, near Paris,\n1784.\n\nIt is some time since I receiv'd the above letters, but I have been too\nbusy till now to think of complying with the request they contain. It\nmight, too, be much better done if I were at home among my papers, which\nwould aid my memory, and help to ascertain dates; but my return being\nuncertain and having just now a little leisure, I will endeavor to\nrecollect and write what I can; if I live to get home, it may there be\ncorrected and improv'd.\n\nNot having any copy here of what is already written, I know not whether\nan account is given of the means I used to establish the Philadelphia\npublic library, which, from a small beginning, is now become so\nconsiderable, though I remember to have come down to near the time of\nthat transaction (1730). I will therefore begin here with an account of\nit, which may be struck out if found to have been already given.\n\nAt the time I establish'd myself in Pennsylvania, there was not a good\nbookseller's shop in any of the colonies to the southward of Boston. In\nNew York and Philad'a the printers were indeed stationers; they sold\nonly paper, etc., almanacs, ballads, and a few common school-books.\nThose who lov'd reading were oblig'd to send for their books from\nEngland; the members of the Junto had each a few. We had left the\nalehouse, where we first met, and hired a room to hold our club in. I\npropos'd that we should all of us bring our books to that room, where\nthey would not only be ready to consult in our conferences, but become a\ncommon benefit, each of us being at liberty to borrow such as he wish'd\nto read at home. This was accordingly done, and for some time contented\nus.\n\nFinding the advantage of this little collection, I propos'd to render\nthe benefit from books more common, by commencing a public subscription\nlibrary. I drew a sketch of the plan and rules that would be necessary,\nand got a skilful conveyancer, Mr. Charles Brockden, to put the whole in\nform of articles of agreement to be subscribed, by which each subscriber\nengag'd to pay a certain sum down for the first purchase of books, and\nan annual contribution for increasing them. So few were the readers at\nthat time in Philadelphia, and the majority of us so poor, that I was\nnot able, with great industry; to find more than fifty persons, mostly\nyoung tradesmen, willing to pay down for this purpose forty shillings\neach, and ten shillings per annum. On this little fund we began. The\nbooks were imported; the library was opened one day in the week for\nlending to the subscribers, on their promissory notes to pay double the\nvalue if not duly returned. The institution soon manifested its utility,\nwas imitated by other towns, and in other provinces. The libraries were\naugmented by donations; reading became fashionable; and our people,\nhaving no publick amusements to divert their attention from study,\nbecame better acquainted with books, and in a few years were observ'd by\nstrangers to be better instructed and more intelligent than people of\nthe same rank generally are in other countries.\n\nWhen we were about to sign the above-mentioned articles, which were to\nbe binding upon us, our heirs, etc., for fifty years, Mr. Brockden, the\nscrivener, said to us, \"You are young men, but it is scarcely probable\nthat any of you will live to see the expiration of the term fix'd in the\ninstrument.\" A number of us, however, are yet living; but the instrument\nwas after a few years rendered null by a charter that incorporated and\ngave perpetuity to the company.\n\nThe objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting the\nsubscriptions, made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting one's\nself as the proposer of any useful project, that might be suppos'd to\nraise one's reputation in the smallest degree above that of one's\nneighbors, when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that\nproject. I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight, and\nstated it as a scheme of a number of friends, who had requested me to go\nabout and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading. In this\nway my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever after practis'd it on\nsuch occasions; and, from my frequent successes, can heartily recommend\nit. The present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterwards be amply\nrepaid. If it remains a while uncertain to whom the merit belongs, some\none more vain than yourself will be encouraged to claim it, and then\neven envy will be disposed to do you justice by plucking those assumed\nfeathers, and restoring them to their right owner.\n\nThis library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study, for\nwhich I set apart an hour or two each day, and thus repair'd in some\ndegree the loss of the learned education my father once intended for me.\nReading was the only amusement I allow'd myself. I spent no time in\ntaverns, games, or frolicks of any kind; and my industry in my business\ncontinu'd as indefatigable as it was necessary. I was indebted for my\nprinting-house; I had a young family coming on to be educated, and I had\nto contend with for business two printers, who were established in the\nplace before me. My circumstances, however, grew daily easier. My\noriginal habits of frugality continuing, and my father having, among his\ninstructions to me when a boy, frequently repeated a proverb of Solomon,\n\"Seest thou a man diligent in his calling, he shall stand before kings,\nhe shall not stand before mean men,\" I from thence considered industry\nas a means of obtaining wealth and distinction, which encourag'd me,\ntho' I did not think that I should ever literally stand before kings,\nwhich, however, has since happened; for I have stood before five, and\neven had the honor of sitting down with one, the King of Denmark, to\ndinner.\n\nWe have an English proverb that says, \"He that would thrive, must ask\nhis wife.\" It was lucky for me that I had one as much dispos'd to\nindustry and frugality as myself. She assisted me cheerfully in my\nbusiness, folding and stitching pamphlets, tending shop, purchasing old\nlinen rags for the papermakers, etc., etc. We kept no idle servants, our\ntable was plain and simple, our furniture of the cheapest. For instance,\nmy breakfast was a long time bread and milk (no tea), and I ate it out\nof a twopenny earthen porringer, with a pewter spoon. But mark how\nluxury will enter families, and make a progress, in spite of principle:\nbeing call'd one morning to breakfast, I found it in a China bowl, with\na spoon of silver! They had been bought for me without my knowledge by\nmy wife, and had cost her the enormous sum of three-and-twenty\nshillings, for which she had no other excuse or apology to make, but\nthat she thought her husband deserv'd a silver spoon and China bowl as\nwell as any of his neighbors. This was the first appearance of plate and\nChina in our house, which afterward, in a course of years, as our wealth\nincreas'd, augmented gradually to several hundred pounds in value.\n\nI had been religiously educated as a Presbyterian; and tho' some of the\ndogmas of that persuasion, such as the eternal decrees of God, election,\nreprobation, etc., appeared to me unintelligible, others doubtful, and I\nearly absented myself from the public assemblies of the sect, Sunday\nbeing my studying day, I never was without some religious principles. I\nnever doubted, for instance, the existence of the Deity; that he made\nthe world, and govern'd it by his Providence; that the most acceptable\nservice of God was the doing good to man; that our souls are immortal;\nand that all crime will be punished, and virtue rewarded, either here or\nhereafter. These I esteem'd the essentials of every religion; and, being\nto be found in all the religions we had in our country, I respected them\nall, tho' with different degrees of respect, as I found them more or\nless mix'd with other articles, which, without any tendency to inspire,\npromote, or confirm morality, serv'd principally to divide us, and make\nus unfriendly to one another. This respect to all, with an opinion that\nthe worst had some good effects, induc'd me to avoid all discourse that\nmight tend to lessen the good opinion another might have of his own\nreligion; and as our province increas'd in people, and new places of\nworship were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary\ncontributions, my mite for such purpose, whatever might be the sect, was\nnever refused.\n\nTho' I seldom attended any public worship, I had still an opinion of its\npropriety, and of its utility when rightly conducted, and I regularly\npaid my annual subscription for the support of the only Presbyterian\nminister or meeting we had in Philadelphia. He us'd to visit me\nsometimes as a friend, and admonish me to attend his administrations,\nand I was now and then prevail'd on to do so, once for five Sundays\nsuccessively. Had he been in my opinion a good preacher, perhaps I might\nhave continued, notwithstanding the occasion I had for the Sunday's\nleisure in my course of study; but his discourses were chiefly either\npolemic arguments, or explications of the peculiar doctrines of our\nsect, and were all to me very dry, uninteresting, and unedifying, since\nnot a single moral principle was inculcated or enforc'd, their aim\nseeming to be rather to make us Presbyterians than good citizens.\n\nAt length he took for his text that verse of the fourth chapter of\nPhilippians, \"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, honest,\njust, pure, lovely, or of good report, if there be any virtue, or any\npraise, think on these things.\" And I imagin'd, in a sermon on such a\ntext, we could not miss of having some morality. But he confin'd himself\nto five points only, as meant by the apostle, viz.: 1. Keeping holy the\nSabbath day. 2. Being diligent in reading the holy Scriptures. 3.\nAttending duly the publick worship. 4. Partaking of the Sacrament. 5.\nPaying a due respect to God's ministers. These might be all good things;\nbut, as they were not the kind of good things that I expected from that\ntext, I despaired of ever meeting with them from any other, was\ndisgusted, and attended his preaching no more. I had some years before\ncompos'd a little Liturgy, or form of prayer, for my own private use\n(viz., in 1728), entitled, Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion. I\nreturn'd to the use of this, and went no more to the public assemblies.\nMy conduct might be blameable, but I leave it, without attempting\nfurther to excuse it; my present purpose being to relate facts, and not\nto make apologies for them.\n\nIt was about this time I conceiv'd the bold and arduous project of\narriving at moral perfection. I wish'd to live without committing any\nfault at any time; I would conquer all that either natural inclination,\ncustom, or company might lead me into. As I knew, or thought I knew,\nwhat was right and wrong, I did not see why I might not always do the\none and avoid the other. But I soon found I had undertaken a task of\nmore difficulty than I had imagined. While my care was employ'd in\nguarding against one fault, I was often surprised by another; habit took\nthe advantage of inattention; inclination was sometimes too strong for\nreason. I concluded, at length, that the mere speculative conviction\nthat it was our interest to be completely virtuous, was not sufficient\nto prevent our slipping; and that the contrary habits must be broken,\nand good ones acquired and established, before we can have any\ndependence on a steady, uniform rectitude of conduct. For this purpose I\ntherefore contrived the following method.\n\nIn the various enumerations of the moral virtues I had met with in my\nreading, I found the catalogue more or less numerous, as different\nwriters included more or fewer ideas under the same name. Temperance,\nfor example, was by some confined to eating and drinking, while by\nothers it was extended to mean the moderating every other pleasure,\nappetite, inclination, or passion, bodily or mental, even to our avarice\nand ambition. I propos'd to myself, for the sake of clearness, to use\nrather more names, with fewer ideas annex'd to each, than a few names\nwith more ideas; and I included under thirteen names of virtues all that\nat that time occurr'd to me as necessary or desirable, and annexed to\neach a short precept, which fully express'd the extent I gave to its\nmeaning.\n\nThese names of virtues, with their precepts, were:\n\n 1. Temperance.\n    Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.\n 2. Silence.\n    Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling\nconversation.\n 3. Order.\n    Let all your things have their places; let each part of your\nbusiness have its time.\n 4. Resolution.\n    Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you\nresolve.\n 5. Frugality.\n    Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste\nnothing.\n 6. Industry.\n    Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all\nunnecessary actions.\n 7. Sincerity.\n    Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you\nspeak, speak accordingly.\n 8. Justice.\n    Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your\nduty.\n 9. Moderation.\n    Avoid extreams; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they\ndeserve.\n10. Cleanliness.\n    Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation.\n11. Tranquillity.\n    Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.\n12. Chastity.\n    Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dulness,\nweakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation.\n13. Humility.\n    Imitate Jesus and Socrates.\n\nMy intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues, I\njudg'd it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the\nwhole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time; and, when I\nshould be master of that, then to proceed to another, and so on, till I\nshould have gone thro' the thirteen; and, as the previous acquisition of\nsome might facilitate the acquisition of certain others, I arrang'd them\nwith that view, as they stand above. Temperance first, as it tends to\nprocure that coolness and clearness of head, which is so necessary where\nconstant vigilance was to be kept up, and guard maintained against the\nunremitting attraction of ancient habits, and the force of perpetual\ntemptations. This being acquir'd and establish'd, Silence would be more\neasy; and my desire being to gain knowledge at the same time that I\nimprov'd in virtue, and considering that in conversation it was obtain'd\nrather by the use of the ears than of the tongue, and therefore wishing\nto break a habit I was getting into of prattling, punning, and joking,\nwhich only made me acceptable to trifling company, I gave Silence the\nsecond place. This and the next, Order, I expected would allow me more\ntime for attending to my project and my studies. Resolution, once become\nhabitual, would keep me firm in my endeavors to obtain all the\nsubsequent virtues; Frugality and Industry freeing me from my remaining\ndebt, and producing affluence and independence, would make more easy the\npractice of Sincerity and Justice, etc., etc. Conceiving then, that,\nagreeably to the advice of Pythagoras in his Golden Verses, daily\nexamination would be necessary, I contrived the following method for\nconducting that examination.\n\nI made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of the\nvirtues. I rul'd each page with red ink, so as to have seven columns,\none for each day of the week, marking each column with a letter for the\nday. I cross'd these columns with thirteen red lines, marking the\nbeginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues, on\nwhich line, and in its proper column, I might mark, by a little black\nspot, every fault I found upon examination to have been committed\nrespecting that virtue upon that day.\n\nForm of the pages.\n\nTEMPERANCE.\neat not to dulness;\ndrink not to elevation.\n\n        S.      M.      T.      W.      T.      F.      S.\nT.\nS.      •       •               •               •\nO.      ••      •       •               •       •       •\nR.                      •                       •\nF.              •                       •\nI.                      •\nS.\nJ.\nM.\nC.\nT.\nC.\nH.\n\nI determined to give a week's strict attention to each of the virtues\nsuccessively. Thus, in the first week, my great guard was to avoid every\nthe least offence against Temperance, leaving the other virtues to their\nordinary chance, only marking every evening the faults of the day. Thus,\nif in the first week I could keep my first line, marked T, clear of\nspots, I suppos'd the habit of that virtue so much strengthen'd, and its\nopposite weaken'd, that I might venture extending my attention to\ninclude the next, and for the following week keep both lines clear of\nspots. Proceeding thus to the last, I could go thro' a course compleat\nin thirteen weeks, and four courses in a year. And like him who, having\na garden to weed, does not attempt to eradicate all the bad herbs at\nonce, which would exceed his reach and his strength, but works on one of\nthe beds at a time, and, having accomplish'd the first, proceeds to a\nsecond, so I should have, I hoped, the encouraging pleasure of seeing on\nmy pages the progress I made in virtue, by clearing successively my\nlines of their spots, till in the end, by a number of courses, I should\nbe happy in viewing a clean book, after a thirteen weeks' daily\nexamination.\n\nThis my little book had for its motto these lines from Addison's Cato:\n\n   \"Here will I hold. If there's a power above us\n    (And that there is, all nature cries aloud\n    Thro' all her works), He must delight in virtue;\n    And that which he delights in must be happy.\"\n\nAnother from Cicero,\n\n\"O vitæ Philosophia dux! O virtutum indagatrix expultrixque vitiorum!\nUnus dies, bene et ex præceptis tuis actus, peccanti immortalitati est\nanteponendus.\"\n\nAnother from the Proverbs of Solomon, speaking of wisdom or virtue:\n\n\"Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and\nhonour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\"\niii. 16, 17.\n\nAnd conceiving God to be the fountain of wisdom, I thought it right and\nnecessary to solicit his assistance for obtaining it; to this end I\nformed the following little prayer, which was prefix'd to my tables of\nexamination, for daily use.\n\n\"O powerful Goodness! bountiful Father! merciful Guide! Increase in me\nthat wisdom which discovers my truest interest. Strengthen my\nresolutions to perform what that wisdom dictates. Accept my kind offices\nto thy other children as the only return in my power for thy continual\nfavors to me.\"\n\nI used also sometimes a little prayer which I took from Thomson's Poems,\nviz.:\n\n   \"Father of light and life, thou Good Supreme!\n    O teach me what is good; teach me Thyself!\n    Save me from folly, vanity, and vice,\n    From every low pursuit; and fill my soul\n    With knowledge, conscious peace, and virtue pure;\n    Sacred, substantial, never-fading bliss!\"\n\nThe precept of Order requiring that every part of my business should\nhave its allotted time, one page in my little book contain'd the\nfollowing scheme of employment for the twenty-four hours of a natural\nday:\n\n  THE MORNING.         { 5}   Rise, wash, and address Powerful\n  Question.            { 6}   Goodness!

I was\nsurpris'd to find myself so much fuller of faults than I had imagined;\nbut I had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish. To avoid the trouble\nof renewing now and then my little book, which, by scraping out the\nmarks on the paper of old faults to make room for new ones in a new\ncourse, became full of holes, I transferr'd my tables and precepts to\nthe ivory leaves of a memorandum book, on which the lines were drawn\nwith red ink, that made a durable stain, and on those lines I mark'd my\nfaults with a black-lead pencil, which marks I could easily wipe out\nwith a wet sponge. After a while I went thro' one course only in a year,\nand afterward only one in several years, till at length I omitted them\nentirely, being employ'd in voyages and business abroad, with a\nmultiplicity of affairs that interfered; but I always carried my little\nbook with me.\n\nMy scheme of Order gave me the most trouble; and I found that, tho' it\nmight be practicable where a man's business was such as to leave him the\ndisposition of his time, that of a journeyman printer, for instance, it\nwas not possible to be exactly observed by a master, who must mix with\nthe world, and often receive people of business at their own hours.\nOrder, too, with regard to places for things, papers, etc., I found\nextreamly difficult to acquire. I had not been early accustomed to it,\nand, having an exceeding good memory, I was not so sensible of the\ninconvenience attending want of method. This article, therefore, cost me\nso much painful attention, and my faults in it vexed me so much, and I\nmade so little progress in amendment, and had such frequent relapses,\nthat I was almost ready to give up the attempt, and content myself with\na faulty character in that respect, like the man who, in buying an ax of\na smith, my neighbour, desired to have the whole of its surface as\nbright as the edge. The smith consented to grind it bright for him if he\nwould turn the wheel; he turn'd, while the smith press'd the broad face\nof the ax hard and heavily on the stone, which made the turning of it\nvery fatiguing. The man came every now and then from the wheel to see\nhow the work went on, and at length would take his ax as it was, without\nfarther grinding. \"No,\" said the smith, \"turn on, turn on; we shall have\nit bright by-and-by; as yet, it is only speckled.\" \"Yes,\" said the man,\n\"but I think I like a speckled ax best.\" And I believe this may have\nbeen the case with many, who, having, for want of some such means as I\nemploy'd, found the difficulty of obtaining good and breaking bad habits\nin other points of vice and virtue, have given up the struggle, and\nconcluded that \"a speckled ax was best\"; for something, that pretended\nto be reason, was every now and then suggesting to me that such extream\nnicety as I exacted of myself might be a kind of foppery in morals,\nwhich, if it were known, would make me ridiculous; that a perfect\ncharacter might be attended with the inconvenience of being envied and\nhated; and that a benevolent man should allow a few faults in himself,\nto keep his friends in countenance.\n\nIn truth, I found myself incorrigible with respect to Order; and now I\nam grown old, and my memory bad, I feel very sensibly the want of it.\nBut, on the whole, tho' I never arrived at the perfection I had been so\nambitious of obtaining, but fell far short of it, yet I was, by the\nendeavour, a better and a happier man than I otherwise should have been\nif I had not attempted it; as those who aim at perfect writing by\nimitating the engraved copies, tho' they never reach the wish'd-for\nexcellence of those copies, their hand is mended by the endeavor, and is\ntolerable while it continues fair and legible.\n\nIt may be well my posterity should be informed that to this little\nartifice, with the blessing of God, their ancestor ow'd the constant\nfelicity of his life, down to his 79th year, in which this is written.\nWhat reverses may attend the remainder is in the hand of Providence;\nbut, if they arrive, the reflection on past happiness enjoy'd ought to\nhelp his bearing them with more resignation. To Temperance he ascribes\nhis long-continued health, and what is still left to him of a good\nconstitution; to Industry and Frugality, the early easiness of his\ncircumstances and acquisition of his fortune, with all that knowledge\nthat enabled him to be a useful citizen, and obtained for him some\ndegree of reputation among the learned; to Sincerity and Justice, the\nconfidence of his country, and the honorable employs it conferred upon\nhim; and to the joint influence of the whole mass of the virtues, even\nin the imperfect state he was able to acquire them, all that evenness of\ntemper, and that cheerfulness in conversation, which makes his company\nstill sought for, and agreeable even to his younger acquaintance. I\nhope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the example and\nreap the benefit.\n\nIt will be remark'd that, tho' my scheme was not wholly without\nreligion, there was in it no mark of any of the distinguishing tenets of\nany particular sect. I had purposely avoided them; for, being fully\npersuaded of the utility and excellency of my method, and that it might\nbe serviceable to people in all religions, and intending some time or\nother to publish it, I would not have any thing in it that should\nprejudice any one, of any sect, against it. I purposed writing a little\ncomment on each virtue, in which I would have shown the advantages of\npossessing it, and the mischiefs attending its opposite vice; and I\nshould have called my book The Art of Virtue, [7] because it would have\nshown the means and manner of obtaining virtue, which would have\ndistinguished it from the mere exhortation to be good, that does not\ninstruct and indicate the means, but is like the apostle's man of verbal\ncharity, who only without showing to the naked and hungry how or where\nthey might get clothes or victuals, exhorted them to be fed and\nclothed.--James ii. 15, 16.\n\n[7] Nothing so likely to make a man's fortune as virtue.--[Marg. note.]\n\nBut it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing this\ncomment was never fulfilled. I did, indeed, from time to time, put down\nshort hints of the sentiments, reasonings, etc., to be made use of in\nit, some of which I have still by me; but the necessary close attention\nto private business in the earlier part of my life, and public business\nsince, have occasioned my postponing it; for, it being connected in my\nmind with a great and extensive project, that required the whole man to\nexecute, and which an unforeseen succession of employs prevented my\nattending to, it has hitherto remain'd unfinish'd.\n\nIn this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this doctrine,\nthat vicious actions are not hurtful because they are forbidden, but\nforbidden because they are hurtful, the nature of man alone considered;\nthat it was, therefore, every one's interest to be virtuous who wish'd\nto be happy even in this world; and I should, from this circumstance\n(there being always in the world a number of rich merchants, nobility,\nstates, and princes, who have need of honest instruments for the\nmanagement of their affairs, and such being so rare), have endeavored to\nconvince young persons that no qualities were so likely to make a poor\nman's fortune as those of probity and integrity.\n\nMy list of virtues contain'd at first but twelve; but a Quaker friend\nhaving kindly informed me that I was generally thought proud; that my\npride show'd itself frequently in conversation; that I was not content\nwith being in the right when discussing any point, but was overbearing,\nand rather insolent, of which he convinc'd me by mentioning several\ninstances; I determined endeavouring to cure myself, if I could, of this\nvice or folly among the rest, and I added Humility to my list, giving an\nextensive meaning to the word.\n\nI cannot boast of much success in acquiring the reality of this virtue,\nbut I had a good deal with regard to the appearance of it. I made it a\nrule to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiments of others,\nand all positive assertion of my own. I even forbid myself, agreeably to\nthe old laws of our Junto, the use of every word or expression in the\nlanguage that imported a fix'd opinion, such as certainly, undoubtedly,\netc., and I adopted, instead of them, I conceive, I apprehend, or I\nimagine a thing to be so or so; or it so appears to me at present. When\nanother asserted something that I thought an error, I deny'd myself the\npleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately some\nabsurdity in his proposition; and in answering I began by observing that\nin certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the\npresent case there appear'd or seem'd to me some difference, etc. I soon\nfound the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I\nengag'd in went on more pleasantly. The modest way in which I propos'd\nmy opinions procur'd them a readier reception and less contradiction; I\nhad less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more\neasily prevail'd with others to give up their mistakes and join with me\nwhen I happened to be in the right.\n\nAnd this mode, which I at first put on with some violence to natural\ninclination, became at length so easy, and so habitual to me, that\nperhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical\nexpression escape me. And to this habit (after my character of\nintegrity) I think it principally owing that I had early so much weight\nwith my fellow-citizens when I proposed new institutions, or alterations\nin the old, and so much influence in public councils when I became a\nmember; for I was but a bad speaker, never eloquent, subject to much\nhesitation in my choice of words, hardly correct in language, and yet I\ngenerally carried my points.\n\nIn reality, there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passions so hard to\nsubdue as pride. Disguise it, struggle with it, beat it down, stifle it,\nmortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive, and will every now\nand then peep out and show itself; you will see it, perhaps, often in\nthis history; for, even if I could conceive that I had compleatly\novercome it, I should probably be proud of my humility.\n\n[Thus far written at Passy, 1784.]\n\n[\"I am now about to write at home, August, 1788, but can not have the\nhelp expected from my papers, many of them being lost in the war. I\nhave, however, found the following.\"] [8]\n\nHaving mentioned a great and extensive project which I had conceiv'd, it\nseems proper that some account should be here given of that project and\nits object. Its first rise in my mind appears in the following little\npaper, accidentally preserv'd, viz.:\n\n[8] This is a marginal memorandum.--B.\n\nObservations on my reading history, in Library, May 19th, 1731.\n\n\"That the great affairs of the world, the wars, revolutions, etc., are\ncarried on and affected by parties.\n\n\"That the view of these parties is their present general interest, or\nwhat they take to be such.\n\n\"That the different views of these different parties occasion all\nconfusion.\n\n\"That while a party is carrying on a general design, each man has his\nparticular private interest in view.\n\n\"That as soon as a party has gain'd its general point, each member\nbecomes intent upon his particular interest; which, thwarting others,\nbreaks that party into divisions, and occasions more confusion.\n\n\"That few in public affairs act from a meer view of the good of their\ncountry, whatever they may pretend; and, tho' their actings bring real\ngood to their country, yet men primarily considered that their own and\ntheir country's interest was united, and did not act from a principle of\nbenevolence.\n\n\"That fewer still, in public affairs, act with a view to the good of\nmankind.\n\n\"There seems to me at present to be great occasion for raising a United\nParty for Virtue, by forming the virtuous and good men of all nations\ninto a regular body, to be govern'd by suitable good and wise rules,\nwhich good and wise men may probably be more unanimous in their\nobedience to, than common people are to common laws.\n\n\"I at present think that whoever attempts this aright, and is well\nqualified, can not fail of pleasing God, and of meeting with success.\n\nB. F.\"\n\nRevolving this project in my mind, as to be undertaken hereafter, when\nmy circumstances should afford me the necessary leisure, I put down from\ntime to time, on pieces of paper, such thoughts as occurr'd to me\nrespecting it. Most of these are lost; but I find one purporting to be\nthe substance of an intended creed, containing, as I thought, the\nessentials of every known religion, and being free of every thing that\nmight shock the professors of any religion. It is express'd in these\nwords, viz.:\n\n\"That there is one God, who made all things.\n\n\"That he governs the world by his providence.\n\n\"That he ought to be worshiped by adoration, prayer, and thanksgiving.\n\n\"But that the most acceptable service of God is doing good to man.\n\n\"That the soul is immortal.\n\n\"And that God will certainly reward virtue and punish vice, either here\nor hereafter.\" [9]\n\n[9] In the Middle Ages, Franklin, if such a phenomenon as Franklin were\npossible in the Middle Ages, would probably have been the founder of a\nmonastic order.--B.\n\nMy ideas at that time were, that the sect should be begun and spread at\nfirst among young and single men only; that each person to be initiated\nshould not only declare his assent to such creed, but should have\nexercised himself with the thirteen weeks' examination and practice of\nthe virtues, as in the before-mention'd model; that the existence of\nsuch a society should be kept a secret, till it was become considerable,\nto prevent solicitations for the admission of improper persons, but that\nthe members should each of them search among his acquaintance for\ningenuous, well-disposed youths, to whom, with prudent caution, the\nscheme should be gradually communicated; that the members should engage\nto afford their advice, assistance, and support to each other in\npromoting one another's interests, business, and advancement in life;\nthat, for distinction, we should be call'd The Society of the Free and\nEasy: free, as being, by the general practice and habit of the virtues,\nfree from the dominion of vice; and particularly by the practice of\nindustry and frugality, free from debt, which exposes a man to\nconfinement, and a species of slavery to his creditors.\n\nThis is as much as I can now recollect of the project, except that I\ncommunicated it in part to two young men, who adopted it with some\nenthusiasm; but my then narrow circumstances, and the necessity I was\nunder of sticking close to my business, occasion'd my postponing the\nfurther prosecution of it at that time; and my multifarious occupations,\npublic and private, induc'd me to continue postponing, so that it has\nbeen omitted till I have no longer strength or activity left sufficient\nfor such an enterprise; tho' I am still of opinion that it was a\npracticable scheme, and might have been very useful, by forming a great\nnumber of good citizens; and I was not discourag'd by the seeming\nmagnitude of the undertaking, as I have always thought that one man of\ntolerable abilities may work great changes, and accomplish great affairs\namong mankind, if he first forms a good plan, and, cutting off all\namusements or other employments that would divert his attention, makes\nthe execution of that same plan his sole study and business.\n\nIn 1732 I first publish'd my Almanack, under the name of Richard\nSaunders; it was continu'd by me about twenty-five years, commonly\ncall'd Poor Richard's Almanac. I endeavor'd to make it both entertaining\nand useful, and it accordingly came to be in such demand, that I reap'd\nconsiderable profit from it, vending annually near ten thousand. And\nobserving that it was generally read, scarce any neighborhood in the\nprovince being without it, I consider'd it as a proper vehicle for\nconveying instruction among the common people, who bought scarcely any\nother books; I therefore filled all the little spaces that occurr'd\nbetween the remarkable days in the calendar with proverbial sentences,\nchiefly such as inculcated industry and frugality, as the means of\nprocuring wealth, and thereby securing virtue; it being more difficult\nfor a man in want, to act always honestly, as, to use here one of those\nproverbs, it is hard for an empty sack to stand upright.\n\nThese proverbs, which contained the wisdom of many ages and nations, I\nassembled and form'd into a connected discourse prefix'd to the Almanack\nof 1757, as the harangue of a wise old man to the people attending an\nauction. The bringing all these scatter'd counsels thus into a focus\nenabled them to make greater impression. The piece, being universally\napproved, was copied in all the newspapers of the Continent; reprinted\nin Britain on a broad side, to be stuck up in houses; two translations\nwere made of it in French, and great numbers bought by the clergy and\ngentry, to distribute gratis among their poor parishioners and tenants.\nIn Pennsylvania, as it discouraged useless expense in foreign\nsuperfluities, some thought it had its share of influence in producing\nthat growing plenty of money which was observable for several years\nafter its publication.\n\nI considered my newspaper, also, as another means of communicating\ninstruction, and in that view frequently reprinted in it extracts from\nthe Spectator, and other moral writers; and sometimes publish'd little\npieces of my own, which had been first compos'd for reading in our\nJunto. Of these are a Socratic dialogue, tending to prove that, whatever\nmight be his parts and abilities, a vicious man could not properly be\ncalled a man of sense; and a discourse on self-denial, showing that\nvirtue was not secure till its practice became a habitude, and was free\nfrom the opposition of contrary inclinations. These may be found in the\npapers about the beginning of 1735.\n\nIn the conduct of my newspaper, I carefully excluded all libelling and\npersonal abuse, which is of late years become so disgraceful to our\ncountry. Whenever I was solicited to insert anything of that kind, and\nthe writers pleaded, as they generally did, the liberty of the press,\nand that a newspaper was like a stage-coach, in which any one who would\npay had a right to a place, my answer was, that I would print the piece\nseparately if desired, and the author might have as many copies as he\npleased to distribute himself, but that I would not take upon me to\nspread his detraction; and that, having contracted with my subscribers\nto furnish them with what might be either useful or entertaining, I\ncould not fill their papers with private altercation, in which they had\nno concern, without doing them manifest injustice. Now, many of our\nprinters make no scruple of gratifying the malice of individuals by\nfalse accusations of the fairest characters among ourselves, augmenting\nanimosity even to the producing of duels; and are, moreover, so\nindiscreet as to print scurrilous reflections on the government of\nneighboring states, and even on the conduct of our best national allies,\nwhich may be attended with the most pernicious consequences. These\nthings I mention as a caution to young printers, and that they may be\nencouraged not to pollute their presses and disgrace their profession by\nsuch infamous practices, but refuse steadily, as they may see by my\nexample that such a course of conduct will not, on the whole, be\ninjurious to their interests.\n\nIn 1733 I sent one of my journeymen to Charleston, South Carolina, where\na printer was wanting. I furnish'd him with a press and letters, on an\nagreement of partnership, by which I was to receive one-third of the\nprofits of the business, paying one-third of the expense. He was a man\nof learning, and honest but ignorant in matters of account; and, tho' he\nsometimes made me remittances, I could get no account from him, nor any\nsatisfactory state of our partnership while he lived. On his decease,\nthe business was continued by his widow, who, being born and bred in\nHolland, where, as I have been inform'd, the knowledge of accounts makes\na part of female education, she not only sent me as clear a state as she\ncould find of the transactions past, but continued to account with the\ngreatest regularity and exactness every quarter afterwards, and managed\nthe business with such success, that she not only brought up reputably a\nfamily of children, but, at the expiration of the term, was able to\npurchase of me the printing-house, and establish her son in it.\n\nI mention this affair chiefly for the sake of recommending that branch\nof education for our young females, as likely to be of more use to them\nand their children, in case of widowhood, than either music or dancing,\nby preserving them from losses by imposition of crafty men, and enabling\nthem to continue, perhaps, a profitable mercantile house, with\nestablish'd correspondence, till a son is grown up fit to undertake and\ngo on with it, to the lasting advantage and enriching of the family.\n\nAbout the year 1734 there arrived among us from Ireland a young\nPresbyterian preacher, named Hemphill, who delivered with a good voice,\nand apparently extempore, most excellent discourses, which drew together\nconsiderable numbers of different persuasion, who join'd in admiring\nthem. Among the rest, I became one of his constant hearers, his sermons\npleasing me, as they had little of the dogmatical kind, but inculcated\nstrongly the practice of virtue, or what in the religious stile are\ncalled good works. Those, however, of our congregation, who considered\nthemselves as orthodox Presbyterians, disapprov'd his doctrine, and were\njoin'd by most of the old clergy, who arraign'd him of heterodoxy before\nthe synod, in order to have him silenc'd. I became his zealous partisan,\nand contributed all I could to raise a party in his favour, and we\ncombated for him a while with some hopes of success. There was much\nscribbling pro and con upon the occasion; and finding that, tho' an\nelegant preacher, he was but a poor writer, I lent him my pen and wrote\nfor him two or three pamphlets, and one piece in the Gazette of April,\n1735. Those pamphlets, as is generally the case with controversial\nwritings, tho' eagerly read at the time, were soon out of vogue, and I\nquestion whether a single copy of them now exists.\n\nDuring the contest an unlucky occurrence hurt his cause exceedingly. One\nof our adversaries having heard him preach a sermon that was much\nadmired, thought he had somewhere read the sermon before, or at least a\npart of it. On search he found that part quoted at length, in one of the\nBritish Reviews, from a discourse of Dr. Foster's. This detection gave\nmany of our party disgust, who accordingly abandoned his cause, and\noccasion'd our more speedy discomfiture in the synod. I stuck by him,\nhowever, as I rather approv'd his giving us good sermons compos'd by\nothers, than bad ones of his own manufacture, tho' the latter was the\npractice of our common teachers. He afterward acknowledg'd to me that\nnone of those he preach'd were his own; adding, that his memory was such\nas enabled him to retain and repeat any sermon after one reading only.\nOn our defeat, he left us in search elsewhere of better fortune, and I\nquitted the congregation, never joining it after, tho' I continu'd many\nyears my subscription for the support of its ministers.\n\nI had begun in 1733 to study languages; I soon made myself so much a\nmaster of the French as to be able to read the books with ease. I then\nundertook the Italian. An acquaintance, who was also learning it, us'd\noften to tempt me to play chess with him. Finding this took up too much\nof the time I had to spare for study, I at length refus'd to play any\nmore, unless on this condition, that the victor in every game should\nhave a right to impose a task, either in parts of the grammar to be got\nby heart, or in translations, etc., which tasks the vanquish'd was to\nperform upon honour, before our next meeting. As we play'd pretty\nequally, we thus beat one another into that language. I afterwards with\na little painstaking, acquir'd as much of the Spanish as to read their\nbooks also.\n\nI have already mention'd that I had only one year's instruction in a\nLatin school, and that when very young, after which I neglected that\nlanguage entirely. But, when I had attained an acquaintance with the\nFrench, Italian, and Spanish, I was surpriz'd to find, on looking over a\nLatin Testament, that I understood so much more of that language than I\nhad imagined, which encouraged me to apply myself again to the study of\nit, and I met with more success, as those preceding languages had\ngreatly smooth'd my way.\n\nFrom these circumstances, I have thought that there is some\ninconsistency in our common mode of teaching languages. We are told that\nit is proper to begin first with the Latin, and, having acquir'd that,\nit will be more easy to attain those modern languages which are deriv'd\nfrom it; and yet we do not begin with the Greek, in order more easily to\nacquire the Latin. It is true that, if you can clamber and get to the\ntop of a staircase without using the steps, you will more easily gain\nthem in descending; but certainly, if you begin with the lowest you will\nwith more ease ascend to the top; and I would therefore offer it to the\nconsideration of those who superintend the education of our youth,\nwhether, since many of those who begin with the Latin quit the same\nafter spending some years without having made any great proficiency, and\nwhat they have learnt becomes almost useless, so that their time has\nbeen lost, it would not have been better to have begun with the French,\nproceeding to the Italian, etc.; for, tho', after spending the same\ntime, they should quit the study of languages and never arrive at the\nLatin, they would, however, have acquired another tongue or two, that,\nbeing in modern use, might be serviceable to them in common life.\n\nAfter ten years' absence from Boston, and having become easy in my\ncircumstances, I made a journey thither to visit my relations, which I\ncould not sooner well afford. In returning, I call'd at Newport to see\nmy brother, then settled there with his printing-house. Our former\ndifferences were forgotten, and our meeting was very cordial and\naffectionate. He was fast declining in his health, and requested of me\nthat, in case of his death, which he apprehended not far distant, I\nwould take home his son, then but ten years of age, and bring him up to\nthe printing business. This I accordingly perform'd, sending him a few\nyears to school before I took him into the office. His mother carried on\nthe business till he was grown up, when I assisted him with an\nassortment of new types, those of his father being in a manner worn out.\nThus it was that I made my brother ample amends for the service I had\ndepriv'd him of by leaving him so early.\n\nIn 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the\nsmall-pox, taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly, and still\nregret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I mention for\nthe sake of parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that\nthey should never forgive themselves if a child died under it; my\nexample showing that the regret may be the same either way, and that,\ntherefore, the safer should be chosen.\n\nOur club, the Junto, was found so useful, and afforded such satisfaction\nto the members, that several were desirous of introducing their friends,\nwhich could not well be done without exceeding what we had settled as a\nconvenient number, viz., twelve. We had from the beginning made it a\nrule to keep our institution a secret, which was pretty well observ'd;\nthe intention was to avoid applications of improper persons for\nadmittance, some of whom, perhaps, we might find it difficult to refuse.\nI was one of those who were against any addition to our number, but,\ninstead of it, made in writing a proposal, that every member separately\nshould endeavor to form a subordinate club, with the same rules\nrespecting queries, etc., and without informing them of the connection\nwith the Junto. The advantages proposed were, the improvement of so many\nmore young citizens by the use of our institutions; our better\nacquaintance with the general sentiments of the inhabitants on any\noccasion, as the Junto member might propose what queries we should\ndesire, and was to report to the Junto what pass'd in his separate club;\nthe promotion of our particular interests in business by more extensive\nrecommendation, and the increase of our influence in public affairs, and\nour power of doing good by spreading thro' the several clubs the\nsentiments of the Junto.\n\nThe project was approv'd, and every member undertook to form his club,\nbut they did not all succeed. Five or six only were compleated, which\nwere called by different names, as the Vine, the Union, the Band, etc.\nThey were useful to themselves, and afforded us a good deal of\namusement, information, and instruction, besides answering, in some\nconsiderable degree, our views of influencing the public opinion on\nparticular occasions, of which I shall give some instances in course of\ntime as they happened.\n\nMy first promotion was my being chosen, in 1736, clerk of the General\nAssembly. The choice was made that year without opposition; but the year\nfollowing, when I was again propos'd (the choice, like that of the\nmembers, being annual), a new member made a long speech against me, in\norder to favour some other candidate. I was, however, chosen, which was\nthe more agreeable to me, as, besides the pay for the immediate service\nas clerk, the place gave me a better opportunity of keeping up an\ninterest among the members, which secur'd to me the business of printing\nthe votes, laws, paper money, and other occasional jobbs for the public,\nthat, on the whole, were very profitable.\n\nI therefore did not like the opposition of this new member, who was a\ngentleman of fortune and education, with talents that were likely to\ngive him, in time, great influence in the House, which, indeed,\nafterwards happened. I did not, however, aim at gaining his favour by\npaying any servile respect to him, but, after some time, took this other\nmethod. Having heard that he had in his library a certain very scarce\nand curious book, I wrote a note to him, expressing my desire of\nperusing that book, and requesting he would do me the favour of lending\nit to me for a few days. He sent it immediately, and I return'd it in\nabout a week with another note, expressing strongly my sense of the\nfavour. When we next met in the House, he spoke to me (which he had\nnever done before), and with great civility; and he ever after\nmanifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that we became\ngreat friends, and our friendship continued to his death. This is\nanother instance of the truth of an old maxim I had learned, which says,\n\"He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you\nanother, than he whom you yourself have obliged.\" And it shows how much\nmore profitable it is prudently to remove, than to resent, return, and\ncontinue inimical proceedings.\n\nIn 1737, Colonel Spotswood, late governor of Virginia, and then\npostmaster-general, being dissatisfied with the conduct of his deputy at\nPhiladelphia, respecting some negligence in rendering, and inexactitude\nof his accounts, took from him the commission and offered it to me. I\naccepted it readily, and found it of great advantage; for, tho' the\nsalary was small, it facilitated the correspondence that improv'd my\nnewspaper, increas'd the number demanded, as well as the advertisements\nto be inserted, so that it came to afford me a considerable income. My\nold competitor's newspaper declin'd proportionably, and I was satisfy'd\nwithout retaliating his refusal, while postmaster, to permit my papers\nbeing carried by the riders. Thus he suffer'd greatly from his neglect\nin due accounting; and I mention it as a lesson to those young men who\nmay be employ'd in managing affairs for others, that they should always\nrender accounts, and make remittances, with great clearness and\npunctuality. The character of observing such a conduct is the most\npowerful of all recommendations to new employments and increase of\nbusiness.\n\nI began now to turn my thoughts a little to public affairs, beginning,\nhowever, with small matters. The city watch was one of the first things\nthat I conceiv'd to want regulation. It was managed by the constables of\nthe respective wards in turn; the constable warned a number of\nhousekeepers to attend him for the night. Those who chose never to\nattend paid him six shillings a year to be excus'd, which was suppos'd\nto be for hiring substitutes, but was, in reality, much more than was\nnecessary for that purpose, and made the constableship a place of\nprofit; and the constable, for a little drink, often got such\nragamuffins about him as a watch, that respectable housekeepers did not\nchoose to mix with. Walking the rounds, too, was often neglected, and\nmost of the nights spent in tippling. I thereupon wrote a paper to be\nread in Junto, representing these irregularities, but insisting more\nparticularly on the inequality of this six-shilling tax of the\nconstables, respecting the circumstances of those who paid it, since a\npoor widow housekeeper, all whose property to be guarded by the watch\ndid not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds, paid as much as the\nwealthiest merchant, who had thousands of pounds' worth of goods in his\nstores.\n\nOn the whole, I proposed as a more effectual watch, the hiring of proper\nmen to serve constantly in that business; and as a more equitable way of\nsupporting the charge the levying a tax that should be proportion'd to\nthe property. This idea, being approv'd by the Junto, was communicated\nto the other clubs, but as arising in each of them; and though the plan\nwas not immediately carried into execution, yet, by preparing the minds\nof people for the change, it paved the way for the law obtained a few\nyears after, when the members of our clubs were grown into more\ninfluence.\n\nAbout this time I wrote a paper (first to be read in Junto, but it was\nafterward publish'd) on the different accidents and carelessnesses by\nwhich houses were set on fire, with cautions against them, and means\nproposed of avoiding them. This was much spoken of as a useful piece,\nand gave rise to a project, which soon followed it, of forming a company\nfor the more ready extinguishing of fires, and mutual assistance in\nremoving and securing the goods when in danger. Associates in this\nscheme were presently found, amounting to thirty. Our articles of\nagreement oblig'd every member to keep always in good order, and fit for\nuse, a certain number of leather buckets, with strong bags and baskets\n(for packing and transporting of goods), which were to be brought to\nevery fire; and we agreed to meet once a month and spend a social\nevening together, in discoursing and communicating such ideas as\noccurred to us upon the subject of fires, as might be useful in our\nconduct on such occasions.\n\nThe utility of this institution soon appeared, and many more desiring to\nbe admitted than we thought convenient for one company, they were\nadvised to form another, which was accordingly done; and this went on,\none new company being formed after another, till they became so numerous\nas to include most of the inhabitants who were men of property; and now,\nat the time of my writing this, tho' upward of fifty years since its\nestablishment, that which I first formed, called the Union Fire Company,\nstill subsists and flourishes, tho' the first members are all deceas'd\nbut myself and one, who is older by a year than I am. The small fines\nthat have been paid by members for absence at the monthly meetings have\nbeen apply'd to the purchase of fire-engines, ladders, fire-hooks, and\nother useful implements for each company, so that I question whether\nthere is a city in the world better provided with the means of putting a\nstop to beginning conflagrations; and, in fact, since these\ninstitutions, the city has never lost by fire more than one or two\nhouses at a time, and the flames have often been extinguished before the\nhouse in which they began has been half consumed.\n\nIn 1739 arrived among us from Ireland the Reverend Mr. Whitefield, who\nhad made himself remarkable there as an itinerant preacher. He was at\nfirst permitted to preach in some of our churches; but the clergy,\ntaking a dislike to him, soon refus'd him their pulpits, and he was\noblig'd to preach in the fields. The multitudes of all sects and\ndenominations that attended his sermons were enormous, and it was matter\nof speculation to me, who was one of the number, to observe the\nextraordinary influence of his oratory on his hearers, and how much they\nadmir'd and respected him, notwithstanding his common abuse of them, by\nassuring them that they were naturally half beasts and half devils. It\nwas wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners of our\ninhabitants. From being thoughtless or indifferent about religion, it\nseem'd as if all the world were growing religious, so that one could not\nwalk thro' the town in an evening without hearing psalms sung in\ndifferent families of every street.\n\nAnd it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open air, subject to\nits inclemencies, the building of a house to meet in was no sooner\npropos'd, and persons appointed to receive contributions, but sufficient\nsums were soon receiv'd to procure the ground and erect the building,\nwhich was one hundred feet long and seventy broad, about the size of\nWestminster Hall; and the work was carried on with such spirit as to be\nfinished in a much shorter time than could have been expected. Both\nhouse and ground were vested in trustees, expressly for the use of any\npreacher of any religious persuasion who might desire to say something\nto the people at Philadelphia; the design in building not being to\naccommodate any particular sect, but the inhabitants in general; so that\neven if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a missionary to preach\nMohammedanism to us, he would find a pulpit at his service.\n\nMr. Whitefield, in leaving us, went preaching all the way thro' the\ncolonies to Georgia. The settlement of that province had lately been\nbegun, but, instead of being made with hardy, industrious husbandmen,\naccustomed to labor, the only people fit for such an enterprise, it was\nwith families of broken shop-keepers and other insolvent debtors, many\nof indolent and idle habits, taken out of the jails, who, being set down\nin the woods, unqualified for clearing land, and unable to endure the\nhardships of a new settlement, perished in numbers, leaving many\nhelpless children unprovided for. The sight of their miserable situation\ninspir'd the benevolent heart of Mr. Whitefield with the idea of\nbuilding an Orphan House there, in which they might be supported and\neducated. Returning northward, he preach'd up this charity, and made\nlarge collections, for his eloquence had a wonderful power over the\nhearts and purses of his hearers, of which I myself was an instance.\n\nI did not disapprove of the design, but, as Georgia was then destitute\nof materials and workmen, and it was proposed to send them from\nPhiladelphia at a great expense, I thought it would have been better to\nhave built the house here, and brought the children to it. This I\nadvis'd; but he was resolute in his first project, rejected my counsel,\nand I therefore refus'd to contribute. I happened soon after to attend\none of his sermons, in the course of which I perceived he intended to\nfinish with a collection, and I silently resolved he should get nothing\nfrom me. I had in my pocket a handful of copper money, three or four\nsilver dollars, and five pistoles in gold. As he proceeded I began to\nsoften, and concluded to give the coppers. Another stroke of his oratory\nmade me asham'd of that, and determin'd me to give the silver; and he\nfinish'd so admirably, that I empty'd my pocket wholly into the\ncollector's dish, gold and all. At this sermon there was also one of our\nclub, who, being of my sentiments respecting the building in Georgia,\nand suspecting a collection might be intended, had, by precaution,\nemptied his pockets before he came from home. Towards the conclusion of\nthe discourse, however, he felt a strong desire to give, and apply'd to\na neighbour, who stood near him, to borrow some money for the purpose.\nThe application was unfortunately [made] to perhaps the only man in the\ncompany who had the firmness not to be affected by the preacher. His\nanswer was, \"At any other time, Friend Hopkinson, I would lend to thee\nfreely; but not now, for thee seems to be out of thy right senses.\"\n\nSome of Mr. Whitefield's enemies affected to suppose that he would apply\nthese collections to his own private emolument; but I who was intimately\nacquainted with him (being employed in printing his Sermons and\nJournals, etc.), never had the least suspicion of his integrity, but am\nto this day decidedly of opinion that he was in all his conduct a\nperfectly honest man, and methinks my testimony in his favour ought to\nhave the more weight, as we had no religious connection. He us'd,\nindeed, sometimes to pray for my conversion, but never had the\nsatisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard. Ours was a mere\ncivil friendship, sincere on both sides, and lasted to his death.\n\nThe following instance will show something of the terms on which we\nstood. Upon one of his arrivals from England at Boston, he wrote to me\nthat he should come soon to Philadelphia, but knew not where he could\nlodge when there, as he understood his old friend and host, Mr. Benezet,\nwas removed to Germantown. My answer was, \"You know my house; if you can\nmake shift with its scanty accommodations, you will be most heartily\nwelcome.\" He reply'd, that if I made that kind offer for Christ's sake,\nI should not miss of a reward. And I returned, \"Don't let me be\nmistaken; it was not for Christ's sake, but for your sake.\" One of our\ncommon acquaintance jocosely remark'd, that, knowing it to be the custom\nof the saints, when they received any favour, to shift the burden of the\nobligation from off their own shoulders, and place it in heaven, I had\ncontriv'd to fix it on earth.\n\nThe last time I saw Mr. Whitefield was in London, when he consulted me\nabout his Orphan House concern, and his purpose of appropriating it to\nthe establishment of a college.\n\nHe had a loud and clear voice, and articulated his words and sentences\nso perfectly, that he might be heard and understood at a great distance,\nespecially as his auditories, however numerous, observ'd the most exact\nsilence. He preach'd one evening from the top of the Court-house steps,\nwhich are in the middle of Market-street, and on the west side of\nSecond-street, which crosses it at right angles. Both streets were\nfill'd with his hearers to a considerable distance. Being among the\nhindmost in Market-street, I had the curiosity to learn how far he could\nbe heard, by retiring backwards down the street towards the river; and I\nfound his voice distinct till I came near Front-street, when some noise\nin that street obscur'd it. Imagining then a semi-circle, of which my\ndistance should be the radius, and that it were fill'd with auditors, to\neach of whom I allow'd two square feet, I computed that he might well be\nheard by more than thirty thousand. This reconcil'd me to the newspaper\naccounts of his having preach'd to twenty-five thousand people in the\nfields, and to the ancient histories of generals haranguing whole\narmies, of which I had sometimes doubted.\n\nBy hearing him often, I came to distinguish easily between sermons newly\ncompos'd, and those which he had often preach'd in the course of his\ntravels. His delivery of the latter was so improv'd by frequent\nrepetitions that every accent, every emphasis, every modulation of\nvoice, was so perfectly well turn'd and well plac'd, that, without being\ninterested in the subject, one could not help being pleas'd with the\ndiscourse; a pleasure of much the same kind with that receiv'd from an\nexcellent piece of musick. This is an advantage itinerant preachers have\nover those who are stationary, as the latter can not well improve their\ndelivery of a sermon by so many rehearsals.\n\nHis writing and printing from time to time gave great advantage to his\nenemies; unguarded expressions, and even erroneous opinions, delivered\nin preaching, might have been afterwards explain'd or qualifi'd by\nsupposing others that might have accompani'd them, or they might have\nbeen deny'd; but litera scripta manet. Critics attack'd his writings\nviolently, and with so much appearance of reason as to diminish the\nnumber of his votaries and prevent their encrease; so that I am of\nopinion if he had never written any thing, he would have left behind him\na much more numerous and important sect, and his reputation might in\nthat case have been still growing, even after his death, as there being\nnothing of his writing on which to found a censure and give him a lower\ncharacter, his proselytes would be left at liberty to feign for him as\ngreat a variety of excellence as their enthusiastic admiration might\nwish him to have possessed.\n\nMy business was now continually augmenting, and my circumstances growing\ndaily easier, my newspaper having become very profitable, as being for a\ntime almost the only one in this and the neighbouring provinces. I\nexperienced, too, the truth of the observation, \"that after getting the\nfirst hundred pound, it is more easy to get the second,\" money itself\nbeing of a prolific nature.\n\nThe partnership at Carolina having succeeded, I was encourag'd to engage\nin others, and to promote several of my workmen, who had behaved well,\nby establishing them with printing-houses in different colonies, on the\nsame terms with that in Carolina. Most of them did well, being enabled\nat the end of our term, six years, to purchase the types of me and go on\nworking for themselves, by which means several families were raised.\nPartnerships often finish in quarrels; but I was happy in this, that\nmine were all carried on and ended amicably, owing, I think, a good deal\nto the precaution of having very explicitly settled, in our articles,\nevery thing to be done by or expected from each partner, so that there\nwas nothing to dispute, which precaution I would therefore recommend to\nall who enter into partnerships; for, whatever esteem partners may have\nfor, and confidence in each other at the time of the contract, little\njealousies and disgusts may arise, with ideas of inequality in the care\nand burden of the business, etc., which are attended often with breach\nof friendship and of the connection, perhaps with lawsuits and other\ndisagreeable consequences.\n\nI had, on the whole, abundant reason to be satisfied with my being\nestablished in Pennsylvania. There were, however, two things that I\nregretted, there being no provision for defense, nor for a compleat\neducation of youth; no militia, nor any college. I therefore, in 1743,\ndrew up a proposal for establishing an academy; and at that time,\nthinking the Reverend Mr. Peters, who was out of employ, a fit person to\nsuperintend such an institution, I communicated the project to him; but\nhe, having more profitable views in the service of the proprietaries,\nwhich succeeded, declin'd the undertaking; and, not knowing another at\nthat time suitable for such a trust, I let the scheme lie a while\ndormant. I succeeded better the next year, 1744, in proposing and\nestablishing a Philosophical Society. The paper I wrote for that purpose\nwill be found among my writings, when collected.\n\nWith respect to defense, Spain having been several years at war against\nGreat Britain, and being at length join'd by France, which brought us\ninto great danger; and the laboured and long-continued endeavour of our\ngovernor, Thomas, to prevail with our Quaker Assembly to pass a militia\nlaw, and make other provisions for the security of the province, having\nproved abortive, I determined to try what might be done by a voluntary\nassociation of the people. To promote this, I first wrote and published\na pamphlet, entitled Plain Truth, in which I stated our defenceless\nsituation in strong lights, with the necessity of union and discipline\nfor our defense, and promis'd to propose in a few days an association,\nto be generally signed for that purpose. The pamphlet had a sudden and\nsurprising effect. I was call'd upon for the instrument of association,\nand having settled the draft of it with a few friends, I appointed a\nmeeting of the citizens in the large building before mentioned. The\nhouse was pretty full; I had prepared a number of printed copies, and\nprovided pens and ink dispers'd all over the room. I harangued them a\nlittle on the subject, read the paper, and explained it, and then\ndistributed the copies, which were eagerly signed, not the least\nobjection being made.\n\nWhen the company separated, and the papers were collected, we found\nabove twelve hundred hands; and, other copies being dispersed in the\ncountry, the subscribers amounted at length to upward of ten thousand.\nThese all furnished themselves as soon as they could with arms, formed\nthemselves into companies and regiments, chose their own officers, and\nmet every week to be instructed in the manual exercise, and other parts\nof military discipline. The women, by subscriptions among themselves,\nprovided silk colors, which they presented to the companies, painted\nwith different devices and mottos, which I supplied.\n\nThe officers of the companies composing the Philadelphia regiment, being\nmet, chose me for their colonel; but, conceiving myself unfit, I\ndeclin'd that station, and recommended Mr. Lawrence, a fine person, and\nman of influence, who was accordingly appointed. I then propos'd a\nlottery to defray the expense of building a battery below the town, and\nfurnishing it with cannon. It filled expeditiously, and the battery was\nsoon erected, the merlons being fram'd of logs and fill'd with earth. We\nbought some old cannon from Boston, but, these not being sufficient, we\nwrote to England for more, soliciting, at the same time, our\nproprietaries for some assistance, tho' without much expectation of\nobtaining it.\n\nMeanwhile, Colonel Lawrence, William Allen, Abram Taylor, Esqr., and\nmyself were sent to New York by the associators, commission'd to borrow\nsome cannon of Governor Clinton. He at first refus'd us peremptorily;\nbut at dinner with his council, where there was great drinking of\nMadeira wine, as the custom of that place then was, he softened by\ndegrees, and said he would lend us six. After a few more bumpers he\nadvanc'd to ten; and at length he very good-naturedly conceded eighteen.\nThey were fine cannon, eighteen-pounders, with their carriages, which we\nsoon transported and mounted on our battery, where the associators kept\na nightly guard while the war lasted, and among the rest I regularly\ntook my turn of duty there as a common soldier.\n\nMy activity in these operations was agreeable to the governor and\ncouncil; they took me into confidence, and I was consulted by them in\nevery measure wherein their concurrence was thought useful to the\nassociation. Calling in the aid of religion, I propos'd to them the\nproclaiming a fast, to promote reformation, and implore the blessing of\nHeaven on our undertaking. They embrac'd the motion; but, as it was the\nfirst fast ever thought of in the province, the secretary had no\nprecedent from which to draw the proclamation. My education in New\nEngland, where a fast is proclaimed every year, was here of some\nadvantage: I drew it in the accustomed stile, it was translated into\nGerman, printed in both languages, and divulg'd thro' the province. This\ngave the clergy of the different sects an opportunity of influencing\ntheir congregations to join in the association, and it would probably\nhave been general among all but Quakers if the peace had not soon\ninterven'd.\n\nIt was thought by some of my friends that, by my activity in these\naffairs, I should offend that sect, and thereby lose my interest in the\nAssembly of the province, where they formed a great majority. A young\ngentleman who had likewise some friends in the House, and wished to\nsucceed me as their clerk, acquainted me that it was decided to displace\nme at the next election; and he, therefore, in good will, advis'd me to\nresign, as more consistent with my honour than being turn'd out. My\nanswer to him was, that I had read or heard of some public man who made\nit a rule never to ask for an office, and never to refuse one when\noffer'd to him. \"I approve,\" says I, \"of his rule, and will practice it\nwith a small addition; I shall never ask, never refuse, nor ever resign\nan office. If they will have my office of clerk to dispose of to\nanother, they shall take it from me. I will not, by giving it up, lose\nmy right of some time or other making reprisals on my adversaries.\" I\nheard, however, no more of this; I was chosen again unanimously as usual\nat the next election. Possibly, as they dislik'd my late intimacy with\nthe members of council, who had join'd the governors in all the disputes\nabout military preparations, with which the House had long been\nharass'd, they might have been pleas'd if I would voluntarily have left\nthem; but they did not care to displace me on account merely of my zeal\nfor the association, and they could not well give another reason.\n\nIndeed I had some cause to believe that the defense of the country was\nnot disagreeable to any of them, provided they were not requir'd to\nassist in it. And I found that a much greater number of them than I\ncould have imagined, tho' against offensive war, were clearly for the\ndefensive. Many pamphlets pro and con were publish'd on the subject, and\nsome by good Quakers, in favour of defense, which I believe convinc'd\nmost of their younger people.\n\nA transaction in our fire company gave me some insight into their\nprevailing sentiments. It had been propos'd that we should encourage the\nscheme for building a battery by laying out the present stock, then\nabout sixty pounds, in tickets of the lottery. By our rules, no money\ncould be dispos'd of till the next meeting after the proposal. The\ncompany consisted of thirty members, of which twenty-two were Quakers,\nand eight only of other persuasions. We eight punctually attended the\nmeeting; but, tho' we thought that some of the Quakers would join us, we\nwere by no means sure of a majority. Only one Quaker, Mr. James Morris,\nappear'd to oppose the measure. He expressed much sorrow that it had\never been propos'd, as he said Friends were all against it, and it would\ncreate such discord as might break up the company. We told him that we\nsaw no reason for that; we were the minority, and if Friends were\nagainst the measure, and outvoted us, we must and should, agreeably to\nthe usage of all societies, submit. When the hour for business arriv'd\nit was mov'd to put the vote; he allow'd we might then do it by the\nrules, but, as he could assure us that a number of members intended to\nbe present for the purpose of opposing it, it would be but candid to\nallow a little time for their appearing.\n\nWhile we were disputing this, a waiter came to tell me two gentlemen\nbelow desir'd to speak with me. I went down, and found they were two of\nour Quaker members. They told me there were eight of them assembled at a\ntavern just by; that they were determin'd to come and vote with us if\nthere should be occasion, which they hop'd would not be the case, and\ndesir'd we would not call for their assistance if we could do without\nit, as their voting for such a measure might embroil them with their\nelders and friends. Being thus secure of a majority, I went up, and\nafter a little seeming hesitation, agreed to a delay of another hour.\nThis Mr. Morris allow'd to be extreamly fair. Not one of his opposing\nfriends appear'd, at which he express'd great surprize; and, at the\nexpiration of the hour, we carry'd the resolution eight to one; and as,\nof the twenty-two Quakers, eight were ready to vote with us, and\nthirteen, by their absence, manifested that they were not inclin'd to\noppose the measure, I afterward estimated the proportion of Quakers\nsincerely against defense as one to twenty-one only; for these were all\nregular members of that society, and in good reputation among them, and\nhad due notice of what was propos'd at that meeting.\n\nThe honorable and learned Mr. Logan, who had always been of that sect,\nwas one who wrote an address to them, declaring his approbation of\ndefensive war, and supporting his opinion by many strong arguments. He\nput into my hands sixty pounds to be laid out in lottery tickets for the\nbattery, with directions to apply what prizes might be drawn wholly to\nthat service. He told me the following anecdote of his old master,\nWilliam Penn, respecting defense. He came over from England, when a\nyoung man, with that proprietary, and as his secretary. It was war-time,\nand their ship was chas'd by an armed vessel, suppos'd to be an enemy.\nTheir captain prepar'd for defense; but told William Penn, and his\ncompany of Quakers, that he did not expect their assistance, and they\nmight retire into the cabin, which they did, except James Logan, who\nchose to stay upon deck, and was quarter'd to a gun. The suppos'd enemy\nprov'd a friend, so there was no fighting; but when the secretary went\ndown to communicate the intelligence, William Penn rebuk'd him severely\nfor staying upon deck, and undertaking to assist in defending the\nvessel, contrary to the principles of Friends, especially as it had not\nbeen required by the captain. This reproof, being before all the\ncompany, piqu'd the secretary, who answer'd, \"I being thy servant, why\ndid thee not order me to come down? But thee was willing enough that I\nshould stay and help to fight the ship when thee thought there was\ndanger.\"\n\nMy being many years in the Assembly, the majority of which were\nconstantly Quakers, gave me frequent opportunities of seeing the\nembarrassment given them by their principle against war, whenever\napplication was made to them, by order of the crown, to grant aids for\nmilitary purposes. They were unwilling to offend government, on the one\nhand, by a direct refusal; and their friends, the body of the Quakers,\non the other, by a compliance contrary to their principles; hence a\nvariety of evasions to avoid complying, and modes of disguising the\ncompliance when it became unavoidable. The common mode at last was, to\ngrant money under the phrase of its being \"for the king's use,\" and\nnever to inquire how it was applied.\n\nBut, if the demand was not directly from the crown, that phrase was\nfound not so proper, and some other was to be invented. As, when powder\nwas wanting (I think it was for the garrison at Louisburg), and the\ngovernment of New England solicited a grant of some from Pennsilvania,\nwhich was much urg'd on the House by Governor Thomas, they could not\ngrant money to buy powder, because that was an ingredient of war; but\nthey voted an aid to New England of three thousand pounds, to be put\ninto the hands of the governor, and appropriated it for the purchasing\nof bread, flour, wheat, or other grain. Some of the council, desirous of\ngiving the House still further embarrassment, advis'd the governor not\nto accept provision, as not being the thing he had demanded; but be\nreply'd, \"I shall take the money, for I understand very well their\nmeaning; other grain is gunpowder,\" which he accordingly bought, and\nthey never objected to it. [10]\n\n[10] See the votes.--[Marg. note.]\n\nIt was in allusion to this fact that, when in our fire company we feared\nthe success of our proposal in favour of the lottery, and I had said to\nmy friend Mr. Syng, one of our members, \"If we fail, let us move the\npurchase of a fire-engine with the money; the Quakers can have no\nobjection to that; and then, if you nominate me and I you as a committee\nfor that purpose, we will buy a great gun, which is certainly a\nfire-engine.\" \"I see,\" says he, \"you have improv'd by being so long in\nthe Assembly; your equivocal project would be just a match for their\nwheat or other grain.\"\n\nThese embarrassments that the Quakers suffer'd from having establish'd\nand published it as one of their principles that no kind of war was\nlawful, and which, being once published, they could not afterwards,\nhowever they might change their minds, easily get rid of, reminds me of\nwhat I think a more prudent conduct in another sect among us, that of\nthe Dunkers. I was acquainted with one of its founders, Michael Welfare,\nsoon after it appear'd. He complain'd to me that they were grievously\ncalumniated by the zealots of other persuasions, and charg'd with\nabominable principles and practices, to which they were utter strangers.\nI told him this had always been the case with new sects, and that, to\nput a stop to such abuse, I imagin'd it might be well to publish the\narticles of their belief, and the rules of their discipline. He said\nthat it had been propos'd among them, but not agreed to, for this\nreason: \"When we were first drawn together as a society,\" says he, \"it\nhad pleased God to enlighten our minds so far as to see that some\ndoctrines, which we once esteemed truths, were errors; and that others,\nwhich we had esteemed errors, were real truths. From time to time He has\nbeen pleased to afford us farther light, and our principles have been\nimproving, and our errors diminishing. Now we are not sure that we are\narrived at the end of this progression, and at the perfection of\nspiritual or theological knowledge; and we fear that, if we should once\nprint our confession of faith, we should feel ourselves as if bound and\nconfin'd by it, and perhaps be unwilling to receive farther improvement,\nand our successors still more so, as conceiving what we their elders and\nfounders had done, to be something sacred, never to be departed from.\"\n\nThis modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in the history of\nmankind, every other sect supposing itself in possession of all truth,\nand that those who differ are so far in the wrong; like a man traveling\nin foggy weather, those at some distance before him on the road he sees\nwrapped up in the fog, as well as those behind him, and also the people\nin the fields on each side, but near him all appears clear, tho' in\ntruth he is as much in the fog as any of them. To avoid this kind of\nembarrassment, the Quakers have of late years been gradually declining\nthe public service in the Assembly and in the magistracy, choosing\nrather to quit their power than their principle.\n\nIn order of time, I should have mentioned before, that having, in 1742,\ninvented an open stove for the better warming of rooms, and at the same\ntime saving fuel, as the fresh air admitted was warmed in entering, I\nmade a present of the model to Mr. Robert Grace, one of my early\nfriends, who, having an iron-furnace, found the casting of the plates\nfor these stoves a profitable thing, as they were growing in demand. To\npromote that demand, I wrote and published a pamphlet, entitled \"An\nAccount of the new-invented Pennsylvania Fireplaces; wherein their\nConstruction and Manner of Operation is particularly explained; their\nAdvantages above every other Method of warming Rooms demonstrated; and\nall Objections that have been raised against the Use of them answered\nand obviated,\" etc. This pamphlet had a good effect. Gov'r. Thomas was\nso pleas'd with the construction of this stove, as described in it, that\nhe offered to give me a patent for the sole vending of them for a term\nof years; but I declin'd it from a principle which has ever weighed with\nme on such occasions, viz., That, as we enjoy great advantages from the\ninventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve\nothers by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and\ngenerously.\n\nAn ironmonger in London however, assuming a good deal of my pamphlet,\nand working it up into his own, and making some small changes in the\nmachine, which rather hurt its operation, got a patent for it there, and\nmade, as I was told, a little fortune by it. And this is not the only\ninstance of patents taken out for my inventions by others, tho' not\nalways with the same success, which I never contested, as having no\ndesire of profiting by patents myself, and hating disputes. The use of\nthese fireplaces in very many houses, both of this and the neighbouring\ncolonies, has been, and is, a great saving of wood to the inhabitants.\n\nPeace being concluded, and the association business therefore at an end,\nI turn'd my thoughts again to the affair of establishing an academy. The\nfirst step I took was to associate in the design a number of active\nfriends, of whom the Junto furnished a good part; the next was to write\nand publish a pamphlet, entitled Proposals Relating to the Education of\nYouth in Pennsylvania. This I distributed among the principal\ninhabitants gratis; and as soon as I could suppose their minds a little\nprepared by the perusal of it, I set on foot a subscription for opening\nand supporting an academy; it was to be paid in quotas yearly for five\nyears; by so dividing it, I judg'd the subscription might be larger, and\nI believe it was so, amounting to no less, if I remember right, than\nfive thousand pounds.\n\nIn the introduction to these proposals, I stated their publication, not\nas an act of mine, but of some publick-spirited gentlemen, avoiding as\nmuch as I could, according to my usual rule, the presenting myself to\nthe publick as the author of any scheme for their benefit.\n\nThe subscribers, to carry the project into immediate execution, chose\nout of their number twenty-four trustees, and appointed Mr. Francis,\nthen attorney-general, and myself to draw up constitutions for the\ngovernment of the academy; which being done and signed, a house was\nhired, masters engag'd, and the schools opened, I think, in the same\nyear, 1749.\n\nThe scholars increasing fast, the house was soon found too small, and we\nwere looking out for a piece of ground, properly situated, with\nintention to build, when Providence threw into our way a large house\nready built, which, with a few alterations, might well serve our\npurpose. This was the building before mentioned, erected by the hearers\nof Mr. Whitefield, and was obtained for us in the following manner.\n\nIt is to be noted that the contributions to this building being made by\npeople of different sects, care was taken in the nomination of trustees,\nin whom the building and ground was to be vested, that a predominancy\nshould not be given to any sect, lest in time that predominancy might be\na means of appropriating the whole to the use of such sect, contrary to\nthe original intention. It was therefore that one of each sect was\nappointed, viz., one Church-of-England man, one Presbyterian, one\nBaptist, one Moravian, etc., those, in case of vacancy by death, were to\nfill it by election from among the contributors. The Moravian happen'd\nnot to please his colleagues, and on his death they resolved to have no\nother of that sect. The difficulty then was, how to avoid having two of\nsome other sect, by means of the new choice.\n\nSeveral persons were named, and for that reason not agreed to. At length\none mention'd me, with the observation that I was merely an honest man,\nand of no sect at all, which prevail'd with them to chuse me. The\nenthusiasm which existed when the house was built had long since abated,\nand its trustees had not been able to procure fresh contributions for\npaying the ground-rent, and discharging some other debts the building\nhad occasion'd, which embarrass'd them greatly. Being now a member of\nboth setts of trustees, that for the building and that for the Academy,\nI had a good opportunity of negotiating with both, and brought them\nfinally to an agreement, by which the trustees for the building were to\ncede it to those of the academy, the latter undertaking to discharge the\ndebt, to keep for ever open in the building a large hall for occasional\npreachers, according to the original intention, and maintain a\nfree-school for the instruction of poor children. Writings were\naccordingly drawn, and on paying the debts the trustees of the academy\nwere put in possession of the premises; and by dividing the great and\nlofty hall into stories, and different rooms above and below for the\nseveral schools, and purchasing some additional ground, the whole was\nsoon made fit for our purpose, and the scholars remov'd into the\nbuilding. The care and trouble of agreeing with the workmen, purchasing\nmaterials, and superintending the work, fell upon me; and I went thro'\nit the more cheerfully, as it did not then interfere with my private\nbusiness, having the year before taken a very able, industrious, and\nhonest partner, Mr. David Hall, with whose character I was well\nacquainted, as he had work'd for me four years. He took off my hands all\ncare of the printing-office, paying me punctually my share of the\nprofits. This partnership continued eighteen years, successfully for us\nboth.\n\nThe trustees of the academy, after a while, were incorporated by a\ncharter from the governor; their funds were increas'd by contributions\nin Britain and grants of land from the proprietaries, to which the\nAssembly has since made considerable addition; and thus was established\nthe present University of Philadelphia. I have been continued one of its\ntrustees from the beginning, now near forty years, and have had the very\ngreat pleasure of seeing a number of the youth who have receiv'd their\neducation in it, distinguish'd by their improv'd abilities, serviceable\nin public stations, and ornaments to their country.\n\nWhen I disengaged myself, as above mentioned, from private business, I\nflatter'd myself that, by the sufficient tho' moderate fortune I had\nacquir'd, I had secured leisure during the rest of my life for\nphilosophical studies and amusements. I purchased all Dr. Spence's\napparatus, who had come from England to lecture here, and I proceeded in\nmy electrical experiments with great alacrity; but the publick, now\nconsidering me as a man of leisure, laid hold of me for their purposes,\nevery part of our civil government, and almost at the same time,\nimposing some duty upon me. The governor put me into the commission of\nthe peace; the corporation of the city chose me of the common council,\nand soon after an alderman; and the citizens at large chose me a burgess\nto represent them in Assembly. This latter station was the more\nagreeable to me, as I was at length tired with sitting there to hear\ndebates, in which, as clerk, I could take no part, and which were often\nso unentertaining that I was induc'd to amuse myself with making magic\nsquares or circles, or any thing to avoid weariness; and I conceiv'd my\nbecoming a member would enlarge my power of doing good. I would not,\nhowever, insinuate that my ambition was not flatter'd by all these\npromotions; it certainly was; for, considering my low beginning, they\nwere great things to me; and they were still more pleasing, as being so\nmany spontaneous testimonies of the public good opinion, and by me\nentirely unsolicited.\n\nThe office of justice of the peace I try'd a little, by attending a few\ncourts, and sitting on the bench to hear causes; but finding that more\nknowledge of the common law than I possess'd was necessary to act in\nthat station with credit, I gradually withdrew from it, excusing myself\nby my being oblig'd to attend the higher duties of a legislator in the\nAssembly. My election to this trust was repeated every year for ten\nyears, without my ever asking any elector for his vote, or signifying,\neither directly or indirectly, any desire of being chosen. On taking my\nseat in the House, my son was appointed their clerk.\n\nThe year following, a treaty being to be held with the Indians at\nCarlisle, the governor sent a message to the House, proposing that they\nshould nominate some of their members, to be join'd with some members of\ncouncil, as commissioners for that purpose. [11] The House named the\nspeaker (Mr. Norris) and myself; and, being commission'd, we went to\nCarlisle, and met the Indians accordingly.\n\n[11] See the votes to have this more correctly.--[Marg. note.]\n\nAs those people are extreamly apt to get drunk, and, when so, are very\nquarrelsome and disorderly, we strictly forbad the selling any liquor to\nthem; and when they complain'd of this restriction, we told them that if\nthey would continue sober during the treaty, we would give them plenty\nof rum when business was over. They promis'd this, and they kept their\npromise, because they could get no liquor, and the treaty was conducted\nvery orderly, and concluded to mutual satisfaction. They then claim'd\nand receiv'd the rum; this was in the afternoon; they were near one\nhundred men, women, and children, and were lodg'd in temporary cabins,\nbuilt in the form of a square, just without the town. In the evening,\nhearing a great noise among them, the commissioners walk'd out to see\nwhat was the matter. We found they had made a great bonfire in the\nmiddle of the square; they were all drunk, men and women, quarreling and\nfighting. Their dark-colour'd bodies, half naked, seen only by the\ngloomy light of the bonfire, running after and beating one another with\nfirebrands, accompanied by their horrid yellings, form'd a scene the\nmost resembling our ideas of hell that could well be imagin'd; there was\nno appeasing the tumult, and we retired to our lodging. At midnight a\nnumber of them came thundering at our door, demanding more rum, of which\nwe took no notice.\n\nThe next day, sensible they had misbehav'd in giving us that\ndisturbance, they sent three of their old counselors to make their\napology. The orator acknowledg'd the fault, but laid it upon the rum;\nand then endeavored to excuse the rum by saying, \"The Great Spirit, who\nmade all things, made every thing for some use, and whatever use he\ndesign'd any thing for, that use it should always be put to. Now, when\nhe made rum, he said 'Let this be for the Indians to get drunk with,'\nand it must be so.\" And, indeed, if it be the design of Providence to\nextirpate these savages in order to make room for cultivators of the\nearth, it seems not improbable that rum may be the appointed means. It\nhas already annihilated all the tribes who formerly inhabited the\nsea-coast.\n\nIn 1751, Dr. Thomas Bond, a particular friend of mine, conceived the\nidea of establishing a hospital in Philadelphia (a very beneficent\ndesign, which has been ascrib'd to me, but was originally his), for the\nreception and cure of poor sick persons, whether inhabitants of the\nprovince or strangers. He was zealous and active in endeavouring to\nprocure subscriptions for it, but the proposal being a novelty in\nAmerica, and at first not well understood, he met but with small\nsuccess.\n\nAt length he came to me with the compliment that he found there was no\nsuch thing as carrying a public-spirited project through without my\nbeing concern'd in it. \"For,\" says he, \"I am often ask'd by those to\nwhom I propose subscribing, Have you consulted Franklin upon this\nbusiness? And what does he think of it? And when I tell them that I have\nnot (supposing it rather out of your line), they do not subscribe, but\nsay they will consider of it.\" I enquired into the nature and probable\nutility of his scheme, and receiving from him a very satisfactory\nexplanation, I not only subscrib'd to it myself, but engag'd heartily in\nthe design of procuring subscriptions from others. Previously, however,\nto the solicitation, I endeavoured to prepare the minds of the people by\nwriting on the subject in the newspapers, which was my usual custom in\nsuch cases, but which he had omitted.\n\nThe subscriptions afterwards were more free and generous; but, beginning\nto flag, I saw they would be insufficient without some assistance from\nthe Assembly, and therefore propos'd to petition for it, which was done.\nThe country members did not at first relish the project; they objected\nthat it could only be serviceable to the city, and therefore the\ncitizens alone should be at the expense of it; and they doubted whether\nthe citizens themselves generally approv'd of it. My allegation on the\ncontrary, that it met with such approbation as to leave no doubt of our\nbeing able to raise two thousand pounds by voluntary donations, they\nconsidered as a most extravagant supposition, and utterly impossible.\n\nOn this I form'd my plan; and asking leave to bring in a bill for\nincorporating the contributors according to the prayer of their\npetition, and granting them a blank sum of money, which leave was\nobtained chiefly on the consideration that the House could throw the\nbill out if they did not like it, I drew it so as to make the important\nclause a conditional one, viz., \"And be it enacted, by the authority\naforesaid, that when the said contributors shall have met and chosen\ntheir managers and treasurer, and shall have raised by their\ncontributions a capital stock of ------ value (the yearly interest of\nwhich is to be applied to the accommodating of the sick poor in the said\nhospital, free of charge for diet, attendance, advice, and medicines),\nand shall make the same appear to the satisfaction of the speaker of the\nAssembly for the time being, that then it shall and may be lawful for\nthe said speaker, and he is hereby required, to sign an order on the\nprovincial treasurer for the payment of two thousand pounds, in two\nyearly payments, to the treasurer of the said hospital, to be applied to\nthe founding, building, and finishing of the same.\"\n\nThis condition carried the bill through; for the members, who had\noppos'd the grant, and now conceiv'd they might have the credit of being\ncharitable without the expence, agreed to its passage; and then, in\nsoliciting subscriptions among the people, we urg'd the conditional\npromise of the law as an additional motive to give, since every man's\ndonation would be doubled; thus the clause work'd both ways. The\nsubscriptions accordingly soon exceeded the requisite sum, and we\nclaim'd and receiv'd the public gift, which enabled us to carry the\ndesign into execution. A convenient and handsome building was soon\nerected; the institution has by constant experience been found useful,\nand flourishes to this day; and I do not remember any of my political\nmanœuvres, the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure, or\nwherein, after thinking of it, I more easily excus'd myself for having\nmade some use of cunning.\n\nIt was about this time that another projector, the Rev. Gilbert Tennent,\ncame to me with a request that I would assist him in procuring a\nsubscription for erecting a new meeting-house. It was to be for the use\nof a congregation he had gathered among the Presbyterians, who were\noriginally disciples of Mr. Whitefield. Unwilling to make myself\ndisagreeable to my fellow-citizens by too frequently soliciting their\ncontributions, I absolutely refus'd. He then desired I would furnish him\nwith a list of the names of persons I knew by experience to be generous\nand public-spirited. I thought it would be unbecoming in me, after their\nkind compliance with my solicitations, to mark them out to be worried by\nother beggars, and therefore refus'd also to give such a list. He then\ndesir'd I would at least give him my advice. \"That I will readily do,\"\nsaid I; \"and, in the first place, I advise you to apply to all those\nwhom you know will give something; next, to those whom you are uncertain\nwhether they will give any thing or not, and show them the list of those\nwho have given; and, lastly, do not neglect those who you are sure will\ngive nothing, for in some of them you may be mistaken.\" He laugh'd and\nthank'd me, and said he would take my advice. He did so, for he ask'd of\neverybody, and he obtained a much larger sum than he expected, with\nwhich he erected the capacious and very elegant meeting-house that\nstands in Arch-street.\n\nOur city, tho' laid out with a beautiful regularity, the streets large,\nstrait, and crossing each other at right angles, had the disgrace of\nsuffering those streets to remain long unpav'd, and in wet weather the\nwheels of heavy carriages plough'd them into a quagmire, so that it was\ndifficult to cross them; and in dry weather the dust was offensive. I\nhad liv'd near what was call'd the Jersey Market, and saw with pain the\ninhabitants wading in mud while purchasing their provisions. A strip of\nground down the middle of that market was at length pav'd with brick, so\nthat, being once in the market, they had firm footing, but were often\nover shoes in dirt to get there. By talking and writing on the subject,\nI was at length instrumental in getting the street pav'd with stone\nbetween the market and the brick'd foot-pavement, that was on each side\nnext the houses. This, for some time, gave an easy access to the market\ndry-shod; but, the rest of the street not being pav'd, whenever a\ncarriage came out of the mud upon this pavement, it shook off and left\nits dirt upon it, and it was soon cover'd with mire, which was not\nremov'd, the city as yet having no scavengers.\n\nAfter some inquiry I found a poor industrious man, who was willing to\nundertake keeping the pavement clean, by sweeping it twice a week,\ncarrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours' doors, for the sum\nof sixpence per month, to be paid by each house. I then wrote and\nprinted a paper setting forth the advantages to the neighbourhood that\nmight be obtain'd by this small expense; the greater ease in keeping our\nhouses clean, so much dirt not being brought in by people's feet; the\nbenefit to the shops by more custom, etc., etc., as buyers could more\neasily get at them; and by not having, in windy weather, the dust blown\nin upon their goods, etc., etc. I sent one of these papers to each\nhouse, and in a day or two went round to see who would subscribe an\nagreement to pay these sixpences; it was unanimously sign'd, and for a\ntime well executed. All the inhabitants of the city were delighted with\nthe cleanliness of the pavement that surrounded the market, it being a\nconvenience to all, and this rais'd a general desire to have all the\nstreets paved, and made the people more willing to submit to a tax for\nthat purpose.\n\nAfter some time I drew a bill for paving the city, and brought it into\nthe Assembly. It was just before I went to England, in 1757, and did not\npass till I was gone, [12] and then with an alteration in the mode of\nassessment, which I thought not for the better, but with an additional\nprovision for lighting as well as paving the streets, which was a great\nimprovement. It was by a private person, the late Mr. John Clifton, his\ngiving a sample of the utility of lamps, by placing one at his door,\nthat the people were first impress'd with the idea of enlighting all the\ncity. The honour of this public benefit has also been ascrib'd to me,\nbut it belongs truly to that gentleman. I did but follow his example,\nand have only some merit to claim respecting the form of our lamps, as\ndiffering from the globe lamps we were at first supply'd with from\nLondon. Those we found inconvenient in these respects: they admitted no\nair below; the smoke, therefore, did not readily go out above, but\ncirculated in the globe, lodg'd on its inside, and soon obstructed the\nlight they were intended to afford; giving, besides, the daily trouble\nof wiping them clean; and an accidental stroke on one of them would\ndemolish it, and render it totally useless. I therefore suggested the\ncomposing them of four flat panes, with a long funnel above to draw up\nthe smoke, and crevices admitting air below, to facilitate the ascent of\nthe smoke; by this means they were kept clean, and did not grow dark in\na few hours, as the London lamps do, but continu'd bright till morning,\nand an accidental stroke would generally break but a single pane, easily\nrepair'd.\n\n[12] See votes.\n\nI have sometimes wonder'd that the Londoners did not, from the effect\nholes in the bottom of the globe lamps us'd at Vauxhall have in keeping\nthem clean, learn to have such holes in their street lamps. But, these\nholes being made for another purpose, viz., to communicate flame more\nsuddenly to the wick by a little flax hanging down thro' them, the other\nuse, of letting in air, seems not to have been thought of; and\ntherefore, after the lamps have been lit a few hours, the streets of\nLondon are very poorly illuminated.\n\nThe mention of these improvements puts me in mind of one I propos'd,\nwhen in London, to Dr. Fothergill, who was among the best men I have\nknown, and a great promoter of useful projects. I had observ'd that the\nstreets, when dry, were never swept, and the light dust carried away;\nbut it was suffer'd to accumulate till wet weather reduc'd it to mud,\nand then, after lying some days so deep on the pavement that there was\nno crossing but in paths kept clean by poor people with brooms, it was\nwith great labour rak'd together and thrown up into carts open above,\nthe sides of which suffer'd some of the slush at every jolt on the\npavement to shake out and fall, sometimes to the annoyance of\nfoot-passengers. The reason given for not sweeping the dusty streets\nwas, that the dust would fly into the windows of shops and houses.\n\nAn accidental occurrence had instructed me how much sweeping might be\ndone in a little time. I found at my door in Craven-street, one morning,\na poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom; she appeared very\npale and feeble, as just come out of a fit of sickness. I ask'd who\nemploy'd her to sweep there; she said, \"Nobody, but I am very poor and\nin distress, and I sweeps before gentlefolkses doors, and hopes they\nwill give me something.\" I bid her sweep the whole street clean, and I\nwould give her a shilling; this was at nine o'clock; at 12 she came for\nthe shilling. From the slowness I saw at first in her working, I could\nscarce believe that the work was done so soon, and sent my servant to\nexamine it, who reported that the whole street was swept perfectly\nclean, and all the dust plac'd in the gutter, which was in the middle;\nand the next rain wash'd it quite away, so that the pavement and even\nthe kennel were perfectly clean.\n\nI then judg'd that, if that feeble woman could sweep such a street in\nthree hours, a strong, active man might have done it in half the time.\nAnd here let me remark the convenience of having but one gutter in such\na narrow street, running down its middle, instead of two, one on each\nside, near the footway; for where all the rain that falls on a street\nruns from the sides and meets in the middle, it forms there a current\nstrong enough to wash away all the mud it meets with; but when divided\ninto two channels, it is often too weak to cleanse either, and only\nmakes the mud it finds more fluid, so that the wheels of carriages and\nfeet of horses throw and dash it upon the foot-pavement, which is\nthereby rendered foul and slippery, and sometimes splash it upon those\nwho are walking. My proposal, communicated to the good doctor, was as\nfollows:\n\n\"For the more effectual cleaning and keeping clean the streets of London\nand Westminster, it is proposed that the several watchmen be contracted\nwith to have the dust swept up in dry seasons, and the mud rak'd up at\nother times, each in the several streets and lanes of his round; that\nthey be furnish'd with brooms and other proper instruments for these\npurposes, to be kept at their respective stands, ready to furnish the\npoor people they may employ in the service.\n\n\"That in the dry summer months the dust be all swept up into heaps at\nproper distances, before the shops and windows of houses are usually\nopened, when the scavengers, with close-covered carts, shall also carry\nit all away.\n\n\"That the mud, when rak'd up, be not left in heaps to be spread abroad\nagain by the wheels of carriages and trampling of horses, but that the\nscavengers be provided with bodies of carts, not plac'd high upon\nwheels, but low upon sliders, with lattice bottoms, which, being cover'd\nwith straw, will retain the mud thrown into them, and permit the water\nto drain from it, whereby it will become much lighter, water making the\ngreatest part of its weight; these bodies of carts to be plac'd at\nconvenient distances, and the mud brought to them in wheel-barrows; they\nremaining where plac'd till the mud is drain'd, and then horses brought\nto draw them away.\"\n\nI have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter part of this\nproposal, on account of the narrowness of some streets, and the\ndifficulty of placing the draining-sleds so as not to encumber too much\nthe passage; but I am still of opinion that the former, requiring the\ndust to be swept up and carry'd away before the shops are open, is very\npracticable in the summer, when the days are long; for, in walking thro'\nthe Strand and Fleet-street one morning at seven o'clock, I observ'd\nthere was not one shop open, tho' it had been daylight and the sun up\nabove three hours; the inhabitants of London chusing voluntarily to live\nmuch by candle-light, and sleep by sunshine, and yet often complain, a\nlittle absurdly, of the duty on candles and the high price of tallow.\n\nSome may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating; but\nwhen they consider that tho' dust blown into the eyes of a single\nperson, or into a single shop on a windy day, is but of small\nimportance, yet the great number of the instances in a populous city,\nand its frequent repetitions give it weight and consequence, perhaps\nthey will not censure very severely those who bestow some attention to\naffairs of this seemingly low nature. Human felicity is produc'd not so\nmuch by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by little\nadvantages that occur every day. Thus, if you teach a poor young man to\nshave himself, and keep his razor in order, you may contribute more to\nthe happiness of his life than in giving him a thousand guineas. The\nmoney may be soon spent, the regret only remaining of having foolishly\nconsumed it; but in the other case, he escapes the frequent vexation of\nwaiting for barbers, and of their sometimes dirty fingers, offensive\nbreaths, and dull razors; he shaves when most convenient to him, and\nenjoys daily the pleasure of its being done with a good instrument. With\nthese sentiments I have hazarded the few preceding pages, hoping they\nmay afford hints which some time or other may be useful to a city I\nlove, having lived many years in it very happily, and perhaps to some of\nour towns in America.\n\nHaving been for some time employed by the postmaster-general of America\nas his comptroller in regulating several offices, and bringing the\nofficers to account, I was, upon his death in 1753, appointed, jointly\nwith Mr. William Hunter, to succeed him, by a commission from the\npostmaster-general in England. The American office never had hitherto\npaid any thing to that of Britain. We were to have six hundred pounds a\nyear between us, if we could make that sum out of the profits of the\noffice. To do this, a variety of improvements were necessary; some of\nthese were inevitably at first expensive, so that in the first four\nyears the office became above nine hundred pounds in debt to us. But it\nsoon after began to repay us; and before I was displac'd by a freak of\nthe ministers, of which I shall speak hereafter, we had brought it to\nyield three times as much clear revenue to the crown as the postoffice\nof Ireland. Since that imprudent transaction, they have receiv'd from\nit--not one farthing!\n\nThe business of the postoffice occasion'd my taking a journey this year\nto New England, where the College of Cambridge, of their own motion,\npresented me with the degree of Master of Arts. Yale College, in\nConnecticut, had before made me a similar compliment. Thus, without\nstudying in any college, I came to partake of their honours. They were\nconferr'd in consideration of my improvements and discoveries in the\nelectric branch of natural philosophy.\n\nIn 1754, war with France being again apprehended, a congress of\ncommissioners from the different colonies was, by an order of the Lords\nof Trade, to be assembled at Albany, there to confer with the chiefs of\nthe Six Nations concerning the means of defending both their country and\nours. Governor Hamilton, having receiv'd this order, acquainted the\nHouse with it, requesting they would furnish proper presents for the\nIndians, to be given on this occasion; and naming the speaker (Mr.\nNorris) and myself to join Mr. Thomas Penn and Mr. Secretary Peters as\ncommissioners to act for Pennsylvania. The House approv'd the\nnomination, and provided the goods for the present, and tho' they did\nnot much like treating out of the provinces; and we met the other\ncommissioners at Albany about the middle of June.\n\nIn our way thither, I projected and drew a plan for the union of all the\ncolonies under one government, so far as might be necessary for defense,\nand other important general purposes. As we pass'd thro' New York, I had\nthere shown my project to Mr. James Alexander and Mr. Kennedy, two\ngentlemen of great knowledge in public affairs, and, being fortified by\ntheir approbation, I ventur'd to lay it before the Congress. It then\nappeared that several of the commissioners had form'd plans of the same\nkind. A previous question was first taken, whether a union should be\nestablished, which pass'd in the affirmative unanimously. A committee\nwas then appointed, one member from each colony, to consider the several\nplans and report. Mine happen'd to be preferr'd, and, with a few\namendments, was accordingly reported.\n\nBy this plan the general government was to be administered by a\npresident-general, appointed and supported by the crown, and a grand\ncouncil was to be chosen by the representatives of the people of the\nseveral colonies, met in their respective assemblies. The debates upon\nit in Congress went on daily, hand in hand with the Indian business.\nMany objections and difficulties were started, but at length they were\nall overcome, and the plan was unanimously agreed to, and copies ordered\nto be transmitted to the Board of Trade and to the assemblies of the\nseveral provinces. Its fate was singular: the assemblies did not adopt\nit, as they all thought there was too much prerogative in it, and in\nEngland it was judg'd to have too much of the democratic.\n\nThe Board of Trade therefore did not approve of it, nor recommend it for\nthe approbation of his majesty; but another scheme was form'd, supposed\nto answer the same purpose better, whereby the governors of the\nprovinces, with some members of their respective councils, were to meet\nand order the raising of troops, building of forts, etc., and to draw on\nthe treasury of Great Britain for the expense, which was afterwards to\nbe refunded by an act of Parliament laying a tax on America. My plan,\nwith my reasons in support of it, is to be found among my political\npapers that are printed.\n\nBeing the winter following in Boston, I had much conversation with\nGovernor Shirley upon both the plans. Part of what passed between us on\nthe occasion may also be seen among those papers. The different and\ncontrary reasons of dislike to my plan makes me suspect that it was\nreally the true medium; and I am still of opinion it would have been\nhappy for both sides the water if it had been adopted. The colonies, so\nunited, would have been sufficiently strong to have defended themselves;\nthere would then have been no need of troops from England; of course,\nthe subsequent pretence for taxing America, and the bloody contest it\noccasioned, would have been avoided. But such mistakes are not new;\nhistory is full of the errors of states and princes.\n\nLook round the habitable world, how few\n\nKnow their own good, or, knowing it, pursue!\n\nThose who govern, having much business on their hands, do not generally\nlike to take the trouble of considering and carrying into execution new\nprojects. The best public measures are therefore seldom adopted from\nprevious wisdom, but forc'd by the occasion.\n\nThe Governor of Pennsylvania, in sending it down to the Assembly,\nexpress'd his approbation of the plan, \"as appearing to him to be drawn\nup with great clearness and strength of judgment, and therefore\nrecommended it as well worthy of their closest and most serious\nattention.\" The House, however, by the management of a certain member,\ntook it up when I happen'd to be absent, which I thought not very fair,\nand reprobated it without paying any attention to it at all, to my no\nsmall mortification.\n\nIn my journey to Boston this year, I met at New York with our new\ngovernor, Mr. Morris, just arriv'd there from England, with whom I had\nbeen before intimately acquainted. He brought a commission to supersede\nMr. Hamilton, who, tir'd with the disputes his proprietary instructions\nsubjected him to, had resign'd. Mr. Morris ask'd me if I thought he must\nexpect as uncomfortable an administration. I said, \"No; you may, on the\ncontrary, have a very comfortable one, if you will only take care not to\nenter into any dispute with the Assembly.\" \"My dear friend,\" says he,\npleasantly, \"how can you advise my avoiding disputes? You know I love\ndisputing; it is one of my greatest pleasures; however, to show the\nregard I have for your counsel, I promise you I will, if possible, avoid\nthem.\" He had some reason for loving to dispute, being eloquent, an\nacute sophister, and, therefore, generally successful in argumentative\nconversation. He had been brought up to it from a boy, his father, as I\nhave heard, accustoming his children to dispute with one another for his\ndiversion, while sitting at table after dinner; but I think the practice\nwas not wise; for, in the course of my observation, these disputing,\ncontradicting, and confuting people are generally unfortunate in their\naffairs. They get victory sometimes, but they never get good will, which\nwould be of more use to them. We parted, he going to Philadelphia, and I\nto Boston.\n\nIn returning, I met at New York with the votes of the Assembly, by which\nit appear'd that, notwithstanding his promise to me, he and the House\nwere already in high contention; and it was a continual battle between\nthem as long as he retain'd the government. I had my share of it; for,\nas soon as I got back to my seat in the Assembly, I was put on every\ncommittee for answering his speeches and messages, and by the committees\nalways desired to make the drafts. Our answers, as well as his messages,\nwere often tart, and sometimes indecently abusive; and, as he knew I\nwrote for the Assembly, one might have imagined that, when we met, we\ncould hardly avoid cutting throats; but he was so good-natur'd a man\nthat no personal difference between him and me was occasion'd by the\ncontest, and we often din'd together.\n\nOne afternoon, in the height of this public quarrel, we met in the\nstreet. \"Franklin,\" says he, \"you must go home with me and spend the\nevening; I am to have some company that you will like;\" and, taking me\nby the arm, he led me to his house. In gay conversation over our wine,\nafter supper, he told us, jokingly, that he much admir'd the idea of\nSancho Panza, who, when it was proposed to give him a government,\nrequested it might be a government of blacks, as then, if he could not\nagree with his people, he might sell them. One of his friends, who sat\nnext to me, says, \"Franklin, why do you continue to side with these\ndamn'd Quakers? Had not you better sell them? The proprietor would give\nyou a good price.\" \"The governor,\" says I, \"has not yet blacked them\nenough.\" He, indeed, had labored hard to blacken the Assembly in all his\nmessages, but they wip'd off his coloring as fast as he laid it on, and\nplac'd it, in return, thick upon his own face; so that, finding he was\nlikely to be negrofied himself, he, as well as Mr. Hamilton, grew tir'd\nof the contest, and quitted the government.\n\n[13] These public quarrels were all at bottom owing to the\nproprietaries, our hereditary governors, who, when any expense was to be\nincurred for the defense of their province, with incredible meanness\ninstructed their deputies to pass no act for levying the necessary\ntaxes, unless their vast estates were in the same act expressly excused;\nand they had even taken bonds of these deputies to observe such\ninstructions. The Assemblies for three years held out against this\ninjustice, tho' constrained to bend at last. At length Captain Denny,\nwho was Governor Morris's successor, ventured to disobey those\ninstructions; how that was brought about I shall show hereafter.\n\n[13] My acts in Morris's time, military, etc.--[Marg. note.]\n\nBut I am got forward too fast with my story: there are still some\ntransactions to be mention'd that happened during the administration of\nGovernor Morris.\n\nWar being in a manner commenced with France, the government of\nMassachusetts Bay projected an attack upon Crown Point, and sent Mr.\nQuincy to Pennsylvania, and Mr. Pownall, afterward Governor Pownall, to\nNew York, to solicit assistance. As I was in the Assembly, knew its\ntemper, and was Mr. Quincy's countryman, he appli'd to me for my\ninfluence and assistance. I dictated his address to them, which was well\nreceiv'd. They voted an aid of ten thousand pounds, to be laid out in\nprovisions. But the governor refusing his assent to their bill (which\nincluded this with other sums granted for the use of the crown), unless\na clause were inserted exempting the proprietary estate from bearing any\npart of the tax that would be necessary, the Assembly, tho' very\ndesirous of making their grant to New England effectual, were at a loss\nhow to accomplish it. Mr. Quincy labored hard with the governor to\nobtain his assent, but he was obstinate.\n\nI then suggested a method of doing the business without the governor, by\norders on the trustees of the Loan Office, which, by law, the Assembly\nhad the right of drawing. There was, indeed, little or no money at that\ntime in the office, and therefore I propos'd that the orders should be\npayable in a year, and to bear an interest of five per cent. With these\norders I suppos'd the provisions might easily be purchas'd. The\nAssembly, with very little hesitation, adopted the proposal. The orders\nwere immediately printed, and I was one of the committee directed to\nsign and dispose of them. The fund for paying them was the interest of\nall the paper currency then extant in the province upon loan, together\nwith the revenue arising from the excise, which being known to be more\nthan sufficient, they obtain'd instant credit, and were not only\nreceiv'd in payment for the provisions, but many money'd people, who had\ncash lying by them, vested it in those orders, which they found\nadvantageous, as they bore interest while upon hand, and might on any\noccasion be used as money; so that they were eagerly all bought up, and\nin a few weeks none of them were to be seen. Thus this important affair\nwas by my means compleated. My Quincy return'd thanks to the Assembly in\na handsome memorial, went home highly pleas'd with the success of his\nembassy, and ever after bore for me the most cordial and affectionate\nfriendship.\n\nThe British government, not chusing to permit the union of the colonies\nas propos'd at Albany, and to trust that union with their defense, lest\nthey should thereby grow too military, and feel their own strength,\nsuspicions and jealousies at this time being entertain'd of them, sent\nover General Braddock with two regiments of regular English troops for\nthat purpose. He landed at Alexandria, in Virginia, and thence march'd\nto Frederictown, in Maryland, where he halted for carriages. Our\nAssembly apprehending, from some information, that he had conceived\nviolent prejudices against them, as averse to the service, wish'd me to\nwait upon him, not as from them, but as postmaster-general, under the\nguise of proposing to settle with him the mode of conducting with most\ncelerity and certainty the despatches between him and the governors of\nthe several provinces, with whom he must necessarily have continual\ncorrespondence, and of which they propos'd to pay the expense. My son\naccompanied me on this journey.\n\nWe found the general at Frederictown, waiting impatiently for the return\nof those he had sent thro' the back parts of Maryland and Virginia to\ncollect waggons. I stayed with him several days, din'd with him daily,\nand had full opportunity of removing all his prejudices, by the\ninformation of what the Assembly had before his arrival actually done,\nand were still willing to do, to facilitate his operations. When I was\nabout to depart, the returns of waggons to be obtained were brought in,\nby which it appear'd that they amounted only to twenty-five, and not all\nof those were in serviceable condition. The general and all the officers\nwere surpris'd, declar'd the expedition was then at an end, being\nimpossible, and exclaim'd against the ministers for ignorantly landing\nthem in a country destitute of the means of conveying their stores,\nbaggage, etc., not less than one hundred and fifty waggons being\nnecessary.\n\nI happened to say I thought it was a pity they had not been landed\nrather in Pennsylvania, as in that country almost every farmer had his\nwaggon. The general eagerly laid hold of my words, and said, \"Then you,\nsir, who are a man of interest there, can probably procure them for us;\nand I beg you will undertake it.\" I ask'd what terms were to be offer'd\nthe owners of the waggons; and I was desir'd to put on paper the terms\nthat appeared to me necessary. This I did, and they were agreed to, and\na commission and instructions accordingly prepar'd immediately. What\nthose terms were will appear in the advertisement I publish'd as soon as\nI arriv'd at Lancaster, which being, from the great and sudden effect it\nproduc'd, a piece of some curiosity, I shall insert it at length, as\nfollows:\n\n\"Advertisement.\n\n\"LANCASTER, April 26, 1755.\n\n\"Whereas, one hundred and fifty waggons, with four horses to each\nwaggon, and fifteen hundred saddle or pack horses, are wanted for the\nservice of his majesty's forces now about to rendezvous at Will's Creek,\nand his excellency General Braddock having been pleased to empower me to\ncontract for the hire of the same, I hereby give notice that I shall\nattend for that purpose at Lancaster from this day to next Wednesday\nevening, and at York from next Thursday morning till Friday evening,\nwhere I shall be ready to agree for waggons and teams, or single horses,\non the following terms, viz.: 1. That there shall be paid for each\nwaggon, with four good horses and a driver, fifteen shillings per diem;\nand for each able horse with a pack-saddle, or other saddle and\nfurniture, two shillings per diem; and for each able horse without a\nsaddle, eighteen pence per diem. 2. That the pay commence from the time\nof their joining the forces at Will's Creek, which must be on or before\nthe 20th of May ensuing, and that a reasonable allowance be paid over\nand above for the time necessary for their travelling to Will's Creek\nand home again after their discharge. 3. Each waggon and team, and every\nsaddle or pack horse, is to be valued by indifferent persons chosen\nbetween me and the owner; and in case of the loss of any waggon, team,\nor other horse in the service, the price according to such valuation is\nto be allowed and paid. 4. Seven days' pay is to be advanced and paid in\nhand by me to the owner of each waggon and team, or horse, at the time\nof contracting, if required, and the remainder to be paid by General\nBraddock, or by the paymaster of the army, at the time of their\ndischarge, or from time to time, as it shall be demanded. 5. No drivers\nof waggons, or persons taking care of the hired horses, are on any\naccount to be called upon to do the duty of soldiers, or be otherwise\nemployed than in conducting or taking care of their carriages or horses.\n6. All oats, Indian corn, or other forage that waggons or horses bring\nto the camp, more than is necessary for the subsistence of the horses,\nis to be taken for the use of the army, and a reasonable price paid for\nthe same.\n\n\"Note.--My son, William Franklin, is empowered to enter into like\ncontracts with any person in Cumberland county.\n\n\"B. Franklin.\"\n\n\"To the inhabitants of the Counties of Lancaster, York and Cumberland.\n\n\"Friends and Countrymen,\n\n\"Being occasionally at the camp at Frederic a few days since, I found\nthe general and officers extremely exasperated on account of their not\nbeing supplied with horses and carriages, which had been expected from\nthis province, as most able to furnish them; but, through the\ndissensions between our governor and Assembly, money had not been\nprovided, nor any steps taken for that purpose.\n\n\"It was proposed to send an armed force immediately into these counties,\nto seize as many of the best carriages and horses as should be wanted,\nand compel as many persons into the service as would be necessary to\ndrive and take care of them.\n\n\"I apprehended that the progress of British soldiers through these\ncounties on such an occasion, especially considering the temper they are\nin, and their resentment against us, would be attended with many and\ngreat inconveniences to the inhabitants, and therefore more willingly\ntook the trouble of trying first what might be done by fair and\nequitable means. The people of these back counties have lately\ncomplained to the Assembly that a sufficient currency was wanting; you\nhave an opportunity of receiving and dividing among you a very\nconsiderable sum; for, if the service of this expedition should\ncontinue, as it is more than probable it will, for one hundred and\ntwenty days, the hire of these waggons and horses will amount to upward\nof thirty thousand pounds, which will be paid you in silver and gold of\nthe king's money.\n\n\"The service will be light and easy, for the army will scarce march\nabove twelve miles per day, and the waggons and baggage-horses, as they\ncarry those things that are absolutely necessary to the welfare of the\narmy, must march with the army, and no faster; and are, for the army's\nsake, always placed where they can be most secure, whether in a march or\nin a camp.\n\n\"If you are really, as I believe you are, good and loyal subjects to his\nmajesty, you may now do a most acceptable service, and make it easy to\nyourselves; for three or four of such as can not separately spare from\nthe business of their plantations a waggon and four horses and a driver,\nmay do it together, one furnishing the waggon, another one or two\nhorses, and another the driver, and divide the pay proportionately\nbetween you; but if you do not this service to your king and country\nvoluntarily, when such good pay and reasonable terms are offered to you,\nyour loyalty will be strongly suspected. The king's business must be\ndone; so many brave troops, come so far for your defense, must not stand\nidle through your backwardness to do what may be reasonably expected\nfrom you; waggons and horses must be had; violent measures will probably\nbe used, and you will be left to seek for a recompense where you can\nfind it, and your case, perhaps, be little pitied or regarded.\n\n\"I have no particular interest in this affair, as, except the\nsatisfaction of endeavoring to do good, I shall have only my labour for\nmy pains. If this method of obtaining the waggons and horses is not\nlikely to succeed, I am obliged to send word to the general in fourteen\ndays; and I suppose Sir John St. Clair, the hussar, with a body of\nsoldiers, will immediately enter the province for the purpose, which I\nshall be sorry to hear, because I am very sincerely and truly your\nfriend and well-wisher,\n\nB. Franklin.\"\n\nI received of the general about eight hundred pounds, to be disbursed in\nadvance-money to the waggon owners, etc.; but that sum being\ninsufficient, I advanc'd upward of two hundred pounds more, and in two\nweeks the one hundred and fifty waggons, with two hundred and fifty-nine\ncarrying horses, were on their march for the camp. The advertisement\npromised payment according to the valuation, in case any waggon or horse\nshould be lost. The owners, however, alleging they did not know General\nBraddock, or what dependence might be had on his promise, insisted on my\nbond for the performance, which I accordingly gave them.\n\nWhile I was at the camp, supping one evening with the officers of\nColonel Dunbar's regiment, he represented to me his concern for the\nsubalterns, who, he said, were generally not in affluence, and could ill\nafford, in this dear country, to lay in the stores that might be\nnecessary in so long a march, thro' a wilderness, where nothing was to\nbe purchas'd. I commiserated their case, and resolved to endeavor\nprocuring them some relief. I said nothing, however, to him of my\nintention, but wrote the next morning to the committee of the Assembly,\nwho had the disposition of some public money, warmly recommending the\ncase of these officers to their consideration, and proposing that a\npresent should be sent them of necessaries and refreshments. My son, who\nhad some experience of a camp life, and of its wants, drew up a list for\nme, which I enclos'd in my letter. The committee approv'd, and used such\ndiligence that, conducted by my son, the stores arrived at the camp as\nsoon as the waggons. They consisted of twenty parcels, each containing\n\n6 lbs. loaf sugar.            1 Gloucester cheese.\n6 lbs. good Muscovado do.     1 kegg containing 20 lbs. good butter.\n1 lb. good green tea.         2 doz. old Madeira wine.\n1 lb. good bohea do.          2 gallons Jamaica spirits.\n6 lbs. good ground coffee.    1 bottle flour of mustard.\n6 lbs. chocolate.             2 well-cur'd hams.\n1-2 cwt. best white biscuit.  1-2 dozen dry'd tongues.\n1-2 lb. pepper.               6 lbs. rice.\n1 quart best white wine       6 lbs. raisins.\nvinegar.\n\nThese twenty parcels, well pack'd, were placed on as many horses, each\nparcel, with the horse, being intended as a present for one officer.\nThey were very thankfully receiv'd, and the kindness acknowledg'd by\nletters to me from the colonels of both regiments, in the most grateful\nterms. The general, too, was highly satisfied with my conduct in\nprocuring him the waggons, etc., and readily paid my account of\ndisbursements, thanking me repeatedly, and requesting my farther\nassistance in sending provisions after him. I undertook this also, and\nwas busily employ'd in it till we heard of his defeat, advancing for the\nservice of my own money, upwards of one thousand pounds sterling, of\nwhich I sent him an account. It came to his hands, luckily for me, a few\ndays before the battle, and he return'd me immediately an order on the\npaymaster for the round sum of one thousand pounds, leaving the\nremainder to the next account. I consider this payment as good luck,\nhaving never been able to obtain that remainder, of which more\nhereafter.\n\nThis general was, I think, a brave man, and might probably have made a\nfigure as a good officer in some European war. But he had too much\nself-confidence, too high an opinion of the validity of regular troops,\nand too mean a one of both Americans and Indians. George Croghan, our\nIndian interpreter, join'd him on his march with one hundred of those\npeople, who might have been of great use to his army as guides, scouts,\netc., if he had treated them kindly; but he slighted and neglected them,\nand they gradually left him.\n\nIn conversation with him one day, he was giving me some account of his\nintended progress. \"After taking Fort Duquesne,\" says he, \"I am to\nproceed to Niagara; and, having taken that, to Frontenac, if the season\nwill allow time; and I suppose it will, for Duquesne can hardly detain\nme above three or four days; and then I see nothing that can obstruct my\nmarch to Niagara.\" Having before revolv'd in my mind the long line his\narmy must make in their march by a very narrow road, to be cut for them\nthro' the woods and bushes, and also what I had read of a former defeat\nof fifteen hundred French, who invaded the Iroquois country, I had\nconceiv'd some doubts and some fears for the event of the campaign. But\nI ventur'd only to say, \"To be sure, sir, if you arrive well before\nDuquesne, with these fine troops, so well provided with artillery, that\nplace not yet compleatly fortified, and as we hear with no very strong\ngarrison, can probably make but a short resistance. The only danger I\napprehend of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of Indians,\nwho, by constant practice, are dexterous in laying and executing them;\nand the slender line, near four miles long, which your army must make,\nmay expose it to be attack'd by surprise in its flanks, and to be cut\nlike a thread into several pieces, which, from their distance, can not\ncome up in time to support each other.\"\n\nHe smil'd at my ignorance, and reply'd, \"These savages may, indeed, be a\nformidable enemy to your raw American militia, but upon the king's\nregular and disciplin'd troops, sir, it is impossible they should make\nany impression.\" I was conscious of an impropriety in my disputing with\na military man in matters of his profession, and said no more. The\nenemy, however, did not take the advantage of his army which I\napprehended its long line of march expos'd it to, but let it advance\nwithout interruption till within nine miles of the place; and then, when\nmore in a body (for it had just passed a river, where the front had\nhalted till all were come over), and in a more open part of the woods\nthan any it had pass'd, attack'd its advanced guard by a heavy fire from\nbehind trees and bushes, which was the first intelligence the general\nhad of an enemy's being near him. This guard being disordered, the\ngeneral hurried the troops up to their assistance, which was done in\ngreat confusion, thro' waggons, baggage, and cattle; and presently the\nfire came upon their flank: the officers, being on horseback, were more\neasily distinguish'd, pick'd out as marks, and fell very fast; and the\nsoldiers were crowded together in a huddle, having or hearing no orders,\nand standing to be shot at till two-thirds of them were killed; and\nthen, being seiz'd with a panick, the whole fled with precipitation.\n\nThe waggoners took each a horse out of his team and scamper'd; their\nexample was immediately followed by others; so that all the waggons,\nprovisions, artillery, and stores were left to the enemy. The general,\nbeing wounded, was brought off with difficulty; his secretary, Mr.\nShirley, was killed by his side; and out of eighty-six officers,\nsixty-three were killed or wounded, and seven hundred and fourteen men\nkilled out of eleven hundred. These eleven hundred had been picked men\nfrom the whole army; the rest had been left behind with Colonel Dunbar,\nwho was to follow with the heavier part of the stores, provisions, and\nbaggage. The flyers, not being pursu'd, arriv'd at Dunbar's camp, and\nthe panick they brought with them instantly seiz'd him and all his\npeople; and, tho' he had now above one thousand men, and the enemy who\nhad beaten Braddock did not at most exceed four hundred Indians and\nFrench together, instead of proceeding, and endeavoring to recover some\nof the lost honour, he ordered all the stores, ammunition, etc., to be\ndestroy'd, that he might have more horses to assist his flight towards\nthe settlements, and less lumber to remove. He was there met with\nrequests from the governors of Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania,\nthat he would post his troops on the frontiers, so as to afford some\nprotection to the inhabitants; but he continu'd his hasty march thro'\nall the country, not thinking himself safe till he arriv'd at\nPhiladelphia, where the inhabitants could protect him. This whole\ntransaction gave us Americans the first suspicion that our exalted ideas\nof the prowess of British regulars had not been well founded.\n\nIn their first march, too, from their landing till they got beyond the\nsettlements, they had plundered and stripped the inhabitants, totally\nruining some poor families, besides insulting, abusing, and confining\nthe people if they remonstrated. This was enough to put us out of\nconceit of such defenders, if we had really wanted any. How different\nwas the conduct of our French friends in 1781, who, during a march thro'\nthe most inhabited part of our country from Rhode Island to Virginia,\nnear seven hundred miles, occasioned not the smallest complaint for the\nloss of a pig, a chicken, or even an apple.\n\nCaptain Orme, who was one of the general's aids-de-camp, and, being\ngrievously wounded, was brought off with him, and continu'd with him to\nhis death, which happen'd in a few days, told me that he was totally\nsilent all the first day, and at night only said, \"Who would have\nthought it?\" That he was silent again the following day, saying only at\nlast, \"We shall better know how to deal with them another time;\" and\ndy'd in a few minutes after.\n\nThe secretary's papers, with all the general's orders, instructions, and\ncorrespondence, falling into the enemy's hands, they selected and\ntranslated into French a number of the articles, which they printed, to\nprove the hostile intentions of the British court before the declaration\nof war. Among these I saw some letters of the general to the ministry,\nspeaking highly of the great service I had rendered the army, and\nrecommending me to their notice. David Hume, too, who was some years\nafter secretary to Lord Hertford, when minister in France, and afterward\nto General Conway, when secretary of state, told me he had seen among\nthe papers in that office, letters from Braddock highly recommending me.\nBut, the expedition having been unfortunate, my service, it seems, was\nnot thought of much value, for those recommendations were never of any\nuse to me.\n\nAs to rewards from himself, I ask'd only one, which was, that he would\ngive orders to his officers not to enlist any more of our bought\nservants, and that he would discharge such as had been already enlisted.\nThis he readily granted, and several were accordingly return'd to their\nmasters, on my application. Dunbar, when the command devolv'd on him,\nwas not so generous. He being at Philadelphia, on his retreat, or rather\nflight, I apply'd to him for the discharge of the servants of three poor\nfarmers of Lancaster county that he had enlisted, reminding him of the\nlate general's orders on that head. He promised me that, if the masters\nwould come to him at Trenton, where he should be in a few days on his\nmarch to New York, he would there deliver their men to them. They\naccordingly were at the expense and trouble of going to Trenton, and\nthere he refus'd to perform his promise, to their great loss and\ndisappointment.\n\nAs soon as the loss of the waggons and horses was generally known, all\nthe owners came upon me for the valuation which I had given bond to pay.\nTheir demands gave me a great deal of trouble, my acquainting them that\nthe money was ready in the paymaster's hands, but that orders for paying\nit must first be obtained from General Shirley, and my assuring them\nthat I had apply'd to that general by letter; but, he being at a\ndistance, an answer could not soon be receiv'd, and they must have\npatience, all this was not sufficient to satisfy, and some began to sue\nme. General Shirley at length relieved me from this terrible situation\nby appointing commissioners to examine the claims, and ordering payment.\nThey amounted to near twenty thousand pound, which to pay would have\nruined me.\n\nBefore we had the news of this defeat, the two Doctors Bond came to me\nwith a subscription paper for raising money to defray the expense of a\ngrand firework, which it was intended to exhibit at a rejoicing on\nreceipt of the news of our taking Fort Duquesne. I looked grave, and\nsaid it would, I thought, be time enough to prepare for the rejoicing\nwhen we knew we should have occasion to rejoice. They seem'd surpris'd\nthat I did not immediately comply with their proposal. \"Why the d--l!\"\nsays one of them, \"you surely don't suppose that the fort will not be\ntaken?\" \"I don't know that it will not be taken, but I know that the\nevents of war are subject to great uncertainty.\" I gave them the reasons\nof my doubting; the subscription was dropt, and the projectors thereby\nmissed the mortification they would have undergone if the firework had\nbeen prepared. Dr. Bond, on some other occasion afterward, said that he\ndid not like Franklin's forebodings.\n\nGovernor Morris, who had continually worried the Assembly with message\nafter message before the defeat of Braddock, to beat them into the\nmaking of acts to raise money for the defense of the province, without\ntaxing, among others, the proprietary estates, and had rejected all\ntheir bills for not having such an exempting clause, now redoubled his\nattacks with more hope of success, the danger and necessity being\ngreater. The Assembly, however, continu'd firm, believing they had\njustice on their side, and that it would be giving up an essential right\nif they suffered the governor to amend their money-bills. In one of the\nlast, indeed, which was for granting fifty thousand pounds, his propos'd\namendment was only of a single word. The bill expressed \"that all\nestates, real and personal, were to be taxed, those of the proprietaries\nnot excepted.\" His amendment was, for not read only: a small, but very\nmaterial alteration. However, when the news of this disaster reached\nEngland, our friends there, whom we had taken care to furnish with all\nthe Assembly's answers to the governor's messages, rais'd a clamor\nagainst the proprietaries for their meanness and injustice in giving\ntheir governor such instructions; some going so far as to say that, by\nobstructing the defense of their province, they forfeited their right to\nit. They were intimidated by this, and sent orders to their\nreceiver-general to add five thousand pounds of their money to whatever\nsum might be given by the Assembly for such purpose.\n\nThis, being notified to the House, was accepted in lieu of their share\nof a general tax, and a new bill was form'd, with an exempting clause,\nwhich passed accordingly. By this act I was appointed one of the\ncommissioners for disposing of the money, sixty thousand pounds. I had\nbeen active in modelling the bill and procuring its passage, and had, at\nthe same time, drawn a bill for establishing and disciplining of a\nvoluntary militia, which I carried thro' the House without much\ndifficulty, as care was taken in it to leave the Quakers at their\nliberty. To promote the association necessary to form the militia, I\nwrote a dialogue, [14] stating and answering all the objections I could\nthink of to such a militia, which was printed, and had, as I thought,\ngreat effect.\n\n[14] This dialogue and the militia act are in the \"Gentleman's Magazine\"\nfor February and March, 1756.--[Marg. note.]\n\nWhile the several companies in the city and country were forming and\nlearning their exercise, the governor prevail'd with me to take charge\nof our North-western frontier, which was infested by the enemy, and\nprovide for the defense of the inhabitants by raising troops and\nbuilding a line of forts. I undertook this military business, tho' I did\nnot conceive myself well qualified for it. He gave me a commission with\nfull powers, and a parcel of blank commissions for officers, to be given\nto whom I thought fit. I had but little difficulty in raising men,\nhaving soon five hundred and sixty under my command. My son, who had in\nthe preceding war been an officer in the army rais'd against Canada, was\nmy aid-de-camp, and of great use to me. The Indians had burned\nGnadenhut, a village settled by the Moravians, and massacred the\ninhabitants; but the place was thought a good situation for one of the\nforts.\n\nIn order to march thither, I assembled the companies at Bethlehem, the\nchief establishment of those people. I was surprised to find it in so\ngood a posture of defense; the destruction of Gnadenhut had made them\napprehend danger. The principal buildings were defended by a stockade;\nthey had purchased a quantity of arms and ammunition from New York, and\nhad even plac'd quantities of small paving stones between the windows of\ntheir high stone houses, for their women to throw down upon the heads of\nany Indians that should attempt to force into them. The armed brethren,\ntoo, kept watch, and reliev'd as methodically as in any garrison town.\nIn conversation with the bishop, Spangenberg, I mention'd this my\nsurprise; for, knowing they had obtained an act of Parliament exempting\nthem from military duties in the colonies, I had suppos'd they were\nconscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms. He answer'd me that it was\nnot one of their established principles, but that, at the time of their\nobtaining that act, it was thought to be a principle with many of their\npeople. On this occasion, however, they, to their surprise, found it\nadopted by but a few. It seems they were either deceiv'd in themselves,\nor deceiv'd the Parliament; but common sense, aided by present danger,\nwill sometimes be too strong for whimsical opinions.\n\nIt was the beginning of January when we set out upon this business of\nbuilding forts. I sent one detachment toward the Minisink, with\ninstructions to erect one for the security of that upper part of the\ncountry, and another to the lower part, with similar instructions; and I\nconcluded to go myself with the rest of my force to Gnadenhut, where a\nfort was tho't more immediately necessary. The Moravians procur'd me\nfive waggons for our tools, stores, baggage, etc.\n\nJust before we left Bethlehem, eleven farmers, who had been driven from\ntheir plantations by the Indians, came to me requesting a supply of\nfirearms, that they might go back and fetch off their cattle. I gave\nthem each a gun with suitable ammunition. We had not march'd many miles\nbefore it began to rain, and it continued raining all day; there were no\nhabitations on the road to shelter us, till we arriv'd near night at the\nhouse of a German, where, and in his barn, we were all huddled together,\nas wet as water could make us. It was well we were not attack'd in our\nmarch, for our arms were of the most ordinary sort, and our men could\nnot keep their gun locks dry. The Indians are dextrous in contrivances\nfor that purpose, which we had not. They met that day the eleven poor\nfarmers above mentioned, and killed ten of them. The one who escap'd\ninform'd that his and his companions' guns would not go off, the priming\nbeing wet with the rain.\n\nThe next day being fair, we continu'd our march, and arriv'd at the\ndesolated Gnadenhut. There was a saw-mill near, round which were left\nseveral piles of boards, with which we soon hutted ourselves; an\noperation the more necessary at that inclement season, as we had no\ntents. Our first work was to bury more effectually the dead we found\nthere, who had been half interr'd by the country people.\n\nThe next morning our fort was plann'd and mark'd out, the circumference\nmeasuring four hundred and fifty-five feet, which would require as many\npalisades to be made of trees, one with another, of a foot diameter\neach. Our axes, of which we had seventy, were immediately set to work to\ncut down trees, and, our men being dextrous in the use of them, great\ndespatch was made. Seeing the trees fall so fast, I had the curiosity to\nlook at my watch when two men began to cut at a pine; in six minutes\nthey had it upon the ground, and I found it of fourteen inches diameter.\nEach pine made three palisades of eighteen feet long, pointed at one\nend. While these were preparing, our other men dug a trench all round,\nof three feet deep, in which the palisades were to be planted; and, our\nwaggons, the bodys being taken off, and the fore and hind wheels\nseparated by taking out the pin which united the two parts of the perch,\nwe had ten carriages, with two horses each, to bring the palisades from\nthe woods to the spot. When they were set up, our carpenters built a\nstage of boards all round within, about six feet high, for the men to\nstand on when to fire thro' the loopholes. We had one swivel gun, which\nwe mounted on one of the angles, and fir'd it as soon as fix'd, to let\nthe Indians know, if any were within hearing, that we had such pieces;\nand thus our fort, if such a magnificent name may be given to so\nmiserable a stockade, was finish'd in a week, though it rain'd so hard\nevery other day that the men could not work.\n\nThis gave me occasion to observe, that, when men are employ'd, they are\nbest content'd; for on the days they worked they were good-natur'd and\ncheerful, and, with the consciousness of having done a good day's work,\nthey spent the evening jollily; but on our idle days they were mutinous\nand quarrelsome, finding fault with their pork, the bread, etc., and in\ncontinual ill-humor, which put me in mind of a sea-captain, whose rule\nit was to keep his men constantly at work; and, when his mate once told\nhim that they had done every thing, and there was nothing further to\nemploy them about, \"Oh,\" says he, \"Make them scour the anchor.\"\n\nThis kind of fort, however contemptible, is a sufficient defense against\nIndians, who have no cannon. Finding ourselves now posted securely, and\nhaving a place to retreat to on occasion, we ventur'd out in parties to\nscour the adjacent country. We met with no Indians, but we found the\nplaces on the neighboring hills where they had lain to watch our\nproceedings. There was an art in their contrivance of those places, that\nseems worth mention. It being winter, a fire was necessary for them; but\na common fire on the surface of the ground would by its light have\ndiscovered their position at a distance. They had therefore dug holes in\nthe ground about three feet diameter, and somewhat deeper; we saw where\nthey had with their hatchets cut off the charcoal from the sides of\nburnt logs lying in the woods. With these coals they had made small\nfires in the bottom of the holes, and we observ'd among the weeds and\ngrass the prints of their bodies, made by their laying all round, with\ntheir legs hanging down in the holes to keep their feet warm, which,\nwith them, is an essential point. This kind of fire, so manag'd, could\nnot discover them, either by its light, flame, sparks, or even smoke: it\nappear'd that their number was not great, and it seems they saw we were\ntoo many to be attacked by them with prospect of advantage.\n\nWe had for our chaplain a zealous Presbyterian minister, Mr. Beatty, who\ncomplained to me that the men did not generally attend his prayers and\nexhortations. When they enlisted, they were promised, besides pay and\nprovisions, a gill of rum a day, which was punctually serv'd out to\nthem, half in the morning, and the other half in the evening; and I\nobserv'd they were as punctual in attending to receive it; upon which I\nsaid to Mr. Beatty, \"It is, perhaps, below the dignity of your\nprofession to act as steward of the rum, but if you were to deal it out\nand only just after prayers, you would have them all about you.\" He\nliked the tho't, undertook the office, and, with the help of a few hands\nto measure out the liquor, executed it to satisfaction, and never were\nprayers more generally and more punctually attended; so that I thought\nthis method preferable to the punishment inflicted by some military laws\nfor non-attendance on divine service.\n\nI had hardly finish'd this business, and got my fort well stor'd with\nprovisions, when I receiv'd a letter from the governor, acquainting me\nthat he had call'd the Assembly, and wished my attendance there, if the\nposture of affairs on the frontiers was such that my remaining there was\nno longer necessary. My friends, too, of the Assembly, pressing me by\ntheir letters to be, if possible, at the meeting, and my three intended\nforts being now compleated, and the inhabitants contented to remain on\ntheir farms under that protection, I resolved to return; the more\nwillingly, as a New England officer, Colonel Clapham, experienced in\nIndian war, being on a visit to our establishment, consented to accept\nthe command. I gave him a commission, and, parading the garrison, had it\nread before them, and introduc'd him to them as an officer who, from his\nskill in military affairs, was much more fit to command them than\nmyself; and, giving them a little exhortation, took my leave. I was\nescorted as far as Bethlehem, where I rested a few days to recover from\nthe fatigue I had undergone. The first night, being in a good bed, I\ncould hardly sleep, it was so different from my hard lodging on the\nfloor of our hut at Gnaden wrapt only in a blanket or two.\n\nWhile at Bethlehem, I inquir'd a little into the practice of the\nMoravians: some of them had accompanied me, and all were very kind to\nme. I found they work'd for a common stock, eat at common tables, and\nslept in common dormitories, great numbers together. In the dormitories\nI observed loopholes, at certain distances all along just under the\nceiling, which I thought judiciously placed for change of air. I was at\ntheir church, where I was entertain'd with good musick, the organ being\naccompanied with violins, hautboys, flutes, clarinets, etc. I understood\nthat their sermons were not usually preached to mixed congregations of\nmen, women, and children, as is our common practice, but that they\nassembled sometimes the married men, at other times their wives, then\nthe young men, the young women, and the little children, each division\nby itself. The sermon I heard was to the latter, who came in and were\nplac'd in rows on benches; the boys under the conduct of a young man,\ntheir tutor, and the girls conducted by a young woman. The discourse\nseem'd well adapted to their capacities, and was deliver'd in a\npleasing, familiar manner, coaxing them, as it were, to be good. They\nbehav'd very orderly, but looked pale and unhealthy, which made me\nsuspect they were kept too much within doors, or not allow'd sufficient\nexercise.\n\nI inquir'd concerning the Moravian marriages, whether the report was\ntrue that they were by lot. I was told that lots were us'd only in\nparticular cases; that generally, when a young man found himself\ndispos'd to marry, he inform'd the elders of his class, who consulted\nthe elder ladies that govern'd the young women. As these elders of the\ndifferent sexes were well acquainted with the tempers and dispositions\nof their respective pupils, they could best judge what matches were\nsuitable, and their judgments were generally acquiesc'd in; but if, for\nexample, it should happen that two or three young women were found to be\nequally proper for the young man, the lot was then recurred to. I\nobjected, if the matches are not made by the mutual choice of the\nparties, some of them may chance to be very unhappy. \"And so they may,\"\nanswer'd my informer, \"if you let the parties chuse for themselves;\"\nwhich, indeed, I could not deny.\n\nBeing returned to Philadelphia, I found the association went on\nswimmingly, the inhabitants that were not Quakers having pretty\ngenerally come into it, formed themselves into companies, and chose\ntheir captains, lieutenants, and ensigns, according to the new law. Dr.\nB. visited me, and gave me an account of the pains he had taken to\nspread a general good liking to the law, and ascribed much to those\nendeavors. I had had the vanity to ascribe all to my Dialogue; however,\nnot knowing but that he might be in the right, I let him enjoy his\nopinion, which I take to be generally the best way in such cases. The\nofficers, meeting, chose me to be colonel of the regiment, which I this\ntime accepted. I forget how many companies we had, but we paraded about\ntwelve hundred well-looking men, with a company of artillery, who had\nbeen furnished with six brass field-pieces, which they had become so\nexpert in the use of as to fire twelve times in a minute. The first time\nI reviewed my regiment they accompanied me to my house, and would salute\nme with some rounds fired before my door, which shook down and broke\nseveral glasses of my electrical apparatus. And my new honour proved not\nmuch less brittle; for all our commissions were soon after broken by a\nrepeal of the law in England.\n\nDuring this short time of my colonelship, being about to set out on a\njourney to Virginia, the officers of my regiment took it into their\nheads that it would be proper for them to escort me out of town, as far\nas the Lower Ferry. Just as I was getting on horseback they came to my\ndoor, between thirty and forty, mounted, and all in their uniforms. I\nhad not been previously acquainted with the project, or I should have\nprevented it, being naturally averse to the assuming of state on any\noccasion; and I was a good deal chagrin'd at their appearance, as I\ncould not avoid their accompanying me. What made it worse was, that, as\nsoon as we began to move, they drew their swords and rode with them\nnaked all the way. Somebody wrote an account of this to the proprietor,\nand it gave him great offense. No such honor had been paid him when in\nthe province, nor to any of his governors; and he said it was only\nproper to princes of the blood royal, which may be true for aught I\nknow, who was, and still am, ignorant of the etiquette in such cases.\n\nThis silly affair, however, greatly increased his rancour against me,\nwhich was before not a little, on account of my conduct in the Assembly\nrespecting the exemption of his estate from taxation, which I had always\noppos'd very warmly, and not without severe reflections on his meanness\nand injustice of contending for it. He accused me to the ministry as\nbeing the great obstacle to the king's service, preventing, by my\ninfluence in the House, the proper form of the bills for raising money,\nand he instanced this parade with my officers as a proof of my having an\nintention to take the government of the province out of his hands by\nforce. He also applied to Sir Everard Fawkener, the postmaster-general,\nto deprive me of my office; but it had no other effect than to procure\nfrom Sir Everard a gentle admonition.\n\nNotwithstanding the continual wrangle between the governor and the\nHouse, in which I, as a member, had so large a share, there still\nsubsisted a civil intercourse between that gentleman and myself,\nand we never had any personal difference. I have sometimes since thought\nthat his little or no resentment against me, for the answers it was\nknown I drew up to his messages, might be the effect of professional\nhabit, and that, being bred a lawyer, he might consider us both as\nmerely advocates for contending clients in a suit, he for the\nproprietaries and I for the Assembly. He would, therefore, sometimes\ncall in a friendly way to advise with me on difficult points, and\nsometimes, tho' not often, take my advice.\n\nWe acted in concert to supply Braddock's army with provisions; and, when\nthe shocking news arrived of his defeat, the governor sent in haste for\nme, to consult with him on measures for preventing the desertion of the\nback counties. I forget now the advice I gave; but I think it was, that\nDunbar should be written to, and prevail'd with, if possible, to post\nhis troops on the frontiers for their protection, till, by\nre-enforcements from the colonies, he might be able to proceed on the\nexpedition. And, after my return from the frontier, he would have had me\nundertake the conduct of such an expedition with provincial troops, for\nthe reduction of Fort Duquesne, Dunbar and his men being otherwise\nemployed; and he proposed to commission me as general. I had not so good\nan opinion of my military abilities as he profess'd to have, and I\nbelieve his professions must have exceeded his real sentiments; but\nprobably he might think that my popularity would facilitate the raising\nof the men, and my influence in Assembly, the grant of money to pay\nthem, and that, perhaps, without taxing the proprietary estate. Finding\nme not so forward to engage as he expected, the project was dropt, and\nhe soon after left the government, being superseded by Captain Denny.\n\nBefore I proceed in relating the part I had in public affairs under this\nnew governor's administration, it may not be amiss here to give some\naccount of the rise and progress of my philosophical reputation.\n\nIn 1746, being at Boston, I met there with a Dr. Spence, who was lately\narrived from Scotland, and show'd me some electric experiments. They\nwere imperfectly perform'd, as he was not very expert; but, being on a\nsubject quite new to me, they equally surpris'd and pleased me. Soon\nafter my return to Philadelphia, our library company receiv'd from Mr.\nP. Collinson, Fellow of the Royal Society of London, a present of a\nglass tube, with some account of the use of it in making such\nexperiments. I eagerly seized the opportunity of repeating what I had\nseen at Boston; and, by much practice, acquir'd great readiness in\nperforming those, also, which we had an account of from England, adding\na number of new ones. I say much practice, for my house was continually\nfull, for some time, with people who came to see these new wonders.\n\nTo divide a little this incumbrance among my friends, I caused a number\nof similar tubes to be blown at our glass-house, with which they\nfurnish'd themselves, so that we had at length several performers. Among\nthese, the principal was Mr. Kinnersley, an ingenious neighbor, who,\nbeing out of business, I encouraged to undertake showing the experiments\nfor money, and drew up for him two lectures, in which the experiments\nwere rang'd in such order, and accompanied with such explanations in\nsuch method, as that the foregoing should assist in comprehending the\nfollowing. He procur'd an elegant apparatus for the purpose, in which\nall the little machines that I had roughly made for myself were nicely\nform'd by instrument-makers. His lectures were well attended, and gave\ngreat satisfaction; and after some time he went thro' the colonies,\nexhibiting them in every capital town, and pick'd up some money. In the\nWest India islands, indeed, it was with difficulty the experiments could\nbe made, from the general moisture of the air.\n\nOblig'd as we were to Mr. Collinson for his present of the tube, etc., I\nthought it right he should be inform'd of our success in using it, and\nwrote him several letters containing accounts of our experiments. He got\nthem read in the Royal Society, where they were not at first thought\nworth so much notice as to be printed in their Transactions. One paper,\nwhich I wrote for Mr. Kinnersley, on the sameness of lightning with\nelectricity, I sent to Dr. Mitchel, an acquaintance of mine, and one of\nthe members also of that society, who wrote me word that it had been\nread, but was laughed at by the connoisseurs. The papers, however, being\nshown to Dr. Fothergill, he thought them of too much value to be\nstifled, and advis'd the printing of them. Mr. Collinson then gave them\nto Cave for publication in his Gentleman's Magazine; but he chose to\nprint them separately in a pamphlet, and Dr. Fothergill wrote the\npreface. Cave, it seems, judged rightly for his profit, for by the\nadditions that arrived after they swell'd to a quarto volume, which has\nhad five editions, and cost him nothing for copy-money.\n\nIt was, however, some time before those papers were much taken notice of\nin England. A copy of them happening to fall into the hands of the Count\nde Buffon, a philosopher deservedly of great reputation in France, and,\nindeed, all over Europe, he prevailed with M. Dalibard to translate them\ninto French, and they were printed at Paris. The publication offended\nthe Abbé Nollet, preceptor in Natural Philosophy to the royal family,\nand an able experimenter, who had form'd and publish'd a theory of\nelectricity, which then had the general vogue. He could not at first\nbelieve that such a work came from America, and said it must have been\nfabricated by his enemies at Paris, to decry his system. Afterwards,\nhaving been assur'd that there really existed such a person as Franklin\nat Philadelphia, which he had doubted, he wrote and published a volume\nof Letters, chiefly address'd to me, defending his theory, and denying\nthe verity of my experiments, and of the positions deduc'd from them.\n\nI once purpos'd answering the abbé, and actually began the answer; but,\non consideration that my writings contain'd a description of experiments\nwhich any one might repeat and verify, and if not to be verifi'd, could\nnot be defended; or of observations offer'd as conjectures, and not\ndelivered dogmatically, therefore not laying me under any obligation to\ndefend them; and reflecting that a dispute between two persons, writing\nin different languages, might be lengthened greatly by mistranslations,\nand thence misconceptions of one another's meaning, much of one of the\nabbé's letters being founded on an error in the translation, I concluded\nto let my papers shift for themselves, believing it was better to spend\nwhat time I could spare from public business in making new experiments,\nthan in disputing about those already made. I therefore never answered\nM. Nollet, and the event gave me no cause to repent my silence; for my\nfriend M. le Roy, of the Royal Academy of Sciences, took up my cause and\nrefuted him; my book was translated into the Italian, German, and Latin\nlanguages; and the doctrine it contain'd was by degrees universally\nadopted by the philosophers of Europe, in preference to that of the\nabbé; so that he lived to see himself the last of his sect, except\nMonsieur B------, of Paris, his élève and immediate disciple.\n\nWhat gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity, was the success\nof one of its proposed experiments, made by Messrs. Dalibard and De Lor\nat Marly, for drawing lightning from the clouds. This engag'd the public\nattention every where. M. de Lor, who had an apparatus for experimental\nphilosophy, and lectur'd in that branch of science, undertook to repeat\nwhat he called the Philadelphia Experiments; and, after they were\nperformed before the king and court, all the curious of Paris flocked to\nsee them. I will not swell this narrative with an account of that\ncapital experiment, nor of the infinite pleasure I receiv'd in the\nsuccess of a similar one I made soon after with a kite at Philadelphia,\nas both are to be found in the histories of electricity.\n\nDr. Wright, an English physician, when at Paris, wrote to a friend, who\nwas of the Royal Society, an account of the high esteem my experiments\nwere in among the learned abroad, and of their wonder that my writings\nhad been so little noticed in England. The society, on this, resum'd the\nconsideration of the letters that had been read to them; and the\ncelebrated Dr. Watson drew up a summary account of them, and of all I\nhad afterwards sent to England on the subject, which he accompanied with\nsome praise of the writer. This summary was then printed in their\nTransactions; and some members of the society in London, particularly\nthe very ingenious Mr. Canton, having verified the experiment of\nprocuring lightning from the clouds by a pointed rod, and acquainting\nthem with the success, they soon made me more than amends for the slight\nwith which they had before treated me. Without my having made any\napplication for that honor, they chose me a member, and voted that I\nshould be excus'd the customary payments, which would have amounted to\ntwenty-five guineas; and ever since have given me their Transactions\ngratis. They also presented me with the gold medal of Sir Godfrey Copley\nfor the year 1753, the delivery of which was accompanied by a very\nhandsome speech of the president, Lord Macclesfield, wherein I was\nhighly honoured.\n\nOur new governor, Captain Denny, brought over for me the\nbefore-mentioned medal from the Royal Society, which he presented to me\nat an entertainment given him by the city. He accompanied it with very\npolite expressions of his esteem for me, having, as he said, been long\nacquainted with my character. After dinner, when the company, as was\ncustomary at that time, were engag'd in drinking, he took me aside into\nanother room, and acquainted me that he had been advis'd by his friends\nin England to cultivate a friendship with me, as one who was capable of\ngiving him the best advice, and of contributing most effectually to the\nmaking his administration easy; that he therefore desired of all things\nto have a good understanding with me, and he begg'd me to be assur'd of\nhis readiness on all occasions to render me every service that might be\nin his power. He said much to me, also, of the proprietor's good\ndisposition towards the province, and of the advantage it might be to us\nall, and to me in particular, if the opposition that had been so long\ncontinu'd to his measures was dropt, and harmony restor'd between him\nand the people; in effecting which, it was thought no one could be more\nserviceable than myself; and I might depend on adequate acknowledgments\nand recompenses, etc., etc. The drinkers, finding we did not return\nimmediately to the table, sent us a decanter of Madeira, which the\ngovernor made liberal use of, and in proportion became more profuse of\nhis solicitations and promises.\n\nMy answers were to this purpose: that my circumstances, thanks to God,\nwere such as to make proprietary favours unnecessary to me; and that,\nbeing a member of the Assembly, I could not possibly accept of any;\nthat, however, I had no personal enmity to the proprietary, and that,\nwhenever the public measures he propos'd should appear to be for the\ngood of the people, no one should espouse and forward them more\nzealously than myself; my past opposition having been founded on this,\nthat the measures which had been urged were evidently intended to serve\nthe proprietary interest, with great prejudice to that of the people;\nthat I was much obliged to him (the governor) for his professions of\nregard to me, and that he might rely on every thing in my power to make\nhis administration as easy as possible, hoping at the same time that he\nhad not brought with him the same unfortunate instruction his\npredecessor had been hamper'd with.\n\nOn this he did not then explain himself; but when he afterwards came to\ndo business with the Assembly, they appear'd again, the disputes were\nrenewed, and I was as active as ever in the opposition, being the\npenman, first, of the request to have a communication of the\ninstructions, and then of the remarks upon them, which may be found in\nthe votes of the time, and in the Historical Review I afterward\npublish'd. But between us personally no enmity arose; we were often\ntogether; he was a man of letters, had seen much of the world, and was\nvery entertaining and pleasing in conversation. He gave me the first\ninformation that my old friend Jas. Ralph was still alive; that he was\nesteem'd one of the best political writers in England; had been employ'd\nin the dispute between Prince Frederic and the king, and had obtain'd a\npension of three hundred a year; that his reputation was indeed small as\na poet, Pope having damned his poetry in the Dunciad; but his prose was\nthought as good as any man's.\n\n[15] The Assembly finally finding the proprietary obstinately persisted\nin manacling their deputies with instructions inconsistent not only with\nthe privileges of the people, but with the service of the crown,\nresolv'd to petition the king against them, and appointed me their agent\nto go over to England, to present and support the petition. The House\nhad sent up a bill to the governor, granting a sum of sixty thousand\npounds for the king's use (ten thousand pounds of which was subjected to\nthe orders of the then general, Lord Loudoun), which the governor\nabsolutely refus'd to pass, in compliance with his instructions.\n\n[15] The many unanimous resolves of the Assembly--what date?--[Marg.\nnote.]\n\nI had agreed with Captain Morris, of the paquet at New York, for my\npassage, and my stores were put on board, when Lord Loudoun arriv'd at\nPhiladelphia, expressly, as he told me, to endeavor an accommodation\nbetween the governor and Assembly, that his majesty's service might not\nbe obstructed by their dissensions. Accordingly, he desir'd the governor\nand myself to meet him, that he might hear what was to be said on both\nsides. We met and discuss'd the business. In behalf of the Assembly, I\nurg'd all the various arguments that may be found in the public papers\nof that time, which were of my writing, and are printed with the minutes\nof the Assembly; and the governor pleaded his instructions; the bond he\nhad given to observe them, and his ruin if he disobey'd, yet seemed not\nunwilling to hazard himself if Lord Loudoun would advise it. This his\nlordship did not chuse to do, though I once thought I had nearly\nprevail'd with him to do it; but finally he rather chose to urge the\ncompliance of the Assembly; and he entreated me to use my endeavours\nwith them for that purpose, declaring that he would spare none of the\nking's troops for the defense of our frontiers, and that, if we did not\ncontinue to provide for that defense ourselves, they must remain expos'd\nto the enemy.\n\nI acquainted the House with what had pass'd, and, presenting them with a\nset of resolutions I had drawn up, declaring our rights, and that we did\nnot relinquish our claim to those rights, but only suspended the\nexercise of them on this occasion thro' force, against which we\nprotested, they at length agreed to drop that bill, and frame another\nconformable to the proprietary instructions. This of course the governor\npass'd, and I was then at liberty to proceed on my voyage. But, in the\nmeantime, the paquet had sailed with my sea-stores, which was some loss\nto me, and my only recompense was his lordship's thanks for my service,\nall the credit of obtaining the accommodation falling to his share.\n\nHe set out for New York before me; and, as the time for dispatching the\npaquet-boats was at his disposition, and there were two then remaining\nthere, one of which, he said, was to sail very soon, I requested to know\nthe precise time, that I might not miss her by any delay of mine. His\nanswer was, \"I have given out that she is to sail on Saturday next; but\nI may let you know, entre nous, that if you are there by Monday morning,\nyou will be in time, but do not delay longer.\" By some accidental\nhinderance at a ferry, it was Monday noon before I arrived, and I was\nmuch afraid she might have sailed, as the wind was fair; but I was soon\nmade easy by the information that she was still in the harbor, and would\nnot move till the next day. One would imagine that I was now on the very\npoint of departing for Europe. I thought so; but I was not then so well\nacquainted with his lordship's character, of which indecision was one of\nthe strongest features. I shall give some instances. It was about the\nbeginning of April that I came to New York, and I think it was near the\nend of June before we sail'd. There were then two of the paquet-boats,\nwhich had been long in port, but were detained for the general's\nletters, which were always to be ready to-morrow. Another paquet\narriv'd; she too was detain'd; and, before we sail'd, a fourth was\nexpected. Ours was the first to be dispatch'd, as having been there\nlongest. Passengers were engag'd in all, and some extremely impatient to\nbe gone, and the merchants uneasy about their letters, and the orders\nthey had given for insurance (it being war time) for fall goods! but\ntheir anxiety avail'd nothing; his lordship's letters were not ready;\nand yet whoever waited on him found him always at his desk, pen in hand,\nand concluded he must needs write abundantly.\n\nGoing myself one morning to pay my respects, I found in his antechamber\none Innis, a messenger of Philadelphia, who had come from thence express\nwith a paquet from Governor Denny for the General. He delivered to me\nsome letters from my friends there, which occasion'd my inquiring when\nhe was to return, and where he lodg'd, that I might send some letters by\nhim. He told me he was order'd to call to-morrow at nine for the\ngeneral's answer to the governor, and should set off immediately. I put\nmy letters into his hands the same day. A fortnight after I met him\nagain in the same place. \"So, you are soon return'd, Innis?\" \"Returned!\nno, I am not gone yet.\" \"How so?\" \"I have called here by order every\nmorning these two weeks past for his lordship's letter, and it is not\nyet ready.\" \"Is it possible, when he is so great a writer? for I see him\nconstantly at his escritoire.\" \"Yes,\" says Innis, \"but he is like St.\nGeorge on the signs, always on horseback, and never rides on.\" This\nobservation of the messenger was, it seems, well founded; for, when in\nEngland, I understood that Mr. Pitt gave it as one reason for removing\nthis general, and sending Generals Amherst and Wolfe, that the minister\nnever heard from him, and could not know what he was doing.\n\nThis daily expectation of sailing, and all the three paquets going down\nto Sandy Hook, to join the fleet there, the passengers thought it best\nto be on board, lest by a sudden order the ships should sail, and they\nbe left behind. There, if I remember right, we were about six weeks,\nconsuming our sea-stores, and oblig'd to procure more. At length the\nfleet sail'd, the General and all his army on board, bound to Louisburg,\nwith intent to besiege and take that fortress; all the paquet-boats in\ncompany ordered to attend the General's ship, ready to receive his\ndispatches when they should be ready. We were out five days before we\ngot a letter with leave to part, and then our ship quitted the fleet and\nsteered for England. The other two paquets he still detained, carried\nthem with him to Halifax, where he stayed some time to exercise the men\nin sham attacks upon sham forts, then alter'd his mind as to besieging\nLouisburg, and return'd to New York, with all his troops, together with\nthe two paquets above mentioned, and all their passengers! During his\nabsence the French and savages had taken Fort George, on the frontier of\nthat province, and the savages had massacred many of the garrison after\ncapitulation.\n\nI saw afterwards in London Captain Bonnell, who commanded one of those\npaquets. He told me that, when he had been detain'd a month, he\nacquainted his lordship that his ship was grown foul, to a degree that\nmust necessarily hinder her fast sailing, a point of consequence for a\npaquet-boat, and requested an allowance of time to heave her down and\nclean her bottom. He was asked how long that would require. He answer'd,\nthree days. The general replied, \"If you can do it in one day, I give\nleave; otherwise not; for you must certainly sail the day after\nto-morrow.\" So he never obtain'd leave, though detained afterwards from\nday to day during full three months.\n\nI saw also in London one of Bonnell's passengers, who was so enrag'd\nagainst his lordship for deceiving and detaining him so long at New\nYork, and then carrying him to Halifax and back again, that he swore he\nwould sue for damages. Whether he did or not, I never heard; but, as he\nrepresented the injury to his affairs, it was very considerable.\n\nOn the whole, I wonder'd much how such a man came to be intrusted with\nso important a business as the conduct of a great army; but, having\nsince seen more of the great world, and the means of obtaining, and\nmotives for giving places, my wonder is diminished. General Shirley, on\nwhom the command of the army devolved upon the death of Braddock, would,\nin my opinion, if continued in place, have made a much better campaign\nthan that of Loudoun in 1757, which was frivolous, expensive, and\ndisgraceful to our nation beyond conception; for, tho' Shirley was not a\nbred soldier, he was sensible and sagacious in himself, and attentive to\ngood advice from others, capable of forming judicious plans, and quick\nand active in carrying them into execution. Loudoun, instead of\ndefending the colonies with his great army, left them totally expos'd\nwhile he paraded idly at Halifax, by which means Fort George was lost,\nbesides, he derang'd all our mercantile operations, and distress'd our\ntrade, by a long embargo on the exportation of provisions, on pretence\nof keeping supplies from being obtain'd by the enemy, but in reality for\nbeating down their price in favor of the contractors, in whose profits,\nit was said, perhaps from suspicion only, he had a share. And, when at\nlength the embargo was taken off, by neglecting to send notice of it to\nCharlestown, the Carolina fleet was detain'd near three months longer,\nwhereby their bottoms were so much damaged by the worm that a great part\nof them foundered in their passage home.\n\nShirley was, I believe, sincerely glad of being relieved from so\nburdensome a charge as the conduct of an army must be to a man\nunacquainted with military business. I was at the entertainment given by\nthe city of New York to Lord Loudoun, on his taking upon him the\ncommand. Shirley, tho' thereby superseded, was present also. There was a\ngreat company of officers, citizens, and strangers, and, some chairs\nhaving been borrowed in the neighborhood, there was one among them very\nlow, which fell to the lot of Mr. Shirley. Perceiving it as I sat by\nhim, I said, \"They have given you, sir, too low a seat.\" \"No matter,\"\nsays he, \"Mr. Franklin, I find a low seat the easiest.\"\n\nWhile I was, as afore mention'd, detain'd at New York, I receiv'd all\nthe accounts of the provisions, etc., that I had furnish'd to Braddock,\nsome of which accounts could not sooner be obtain'd from the different\npersons I had employ'd to assist in the business. I presented them to\nLord Loudoun, desiring to be paid the ballance. He caus'd them to be\nregularly examined by the proper officer, who, after comparing every\narticle with its voucher, certified them to be right; and the balance\ndue for which his lordship promis'd to give me an order on the\npaymaster. This was, however, put off from time to time; and, tho' I\ncall'd often for it by appointment, I did not get it. At length, just\nbefore my departure, he told me he had, on better consideration,\nconcluded not to mix his accounts with those of his predecessors. \"And\nyou,\" says he, \"when in England, have only to exhibit your accounts at\nthe treasury, and you will be paid immediately.\"\n\nI mention'd, but without effect, the great and unexpected expense I had\nbeen put to by being detain'd so long at New York, as a reason for my\ndesiring to be presently paid; and on my observing that it was not right\nI should be put to any further trouble or delay in obtaining the money I\nhad advanc'd, as I charged no commission for my service, \"O, sir,\" says\nhe, \"you must not think of persuading us that you are no gainer; we\nunderstand better those affairs, and know that every one concerned in\nsupplying the army finds means, in the doing it, to fill his own\npockets.\" I assur'd him that was not my case, and that I had not\npocketed a farthing; but he appear'd clearly not to believe me; and,\nindeed, I have since learnt that immense fortunes are often made in such\nemployments. As to my ballance, I am not paid it to this day, of which\nmore hereafter.\n\nOur captain of the paquet had boasted much, before we sailed, of the\nswiftness of his ship; unfortunately, when we came to sea, she proved\nthe dullest of ninety-six sail, to his no small mortification. After\nmany conjectures respecting the cause, when we were near another ship\nalmost as dull as ours, which, however, gain'd upon us, the captain\nordered all hands to come aft, and stand as near the ensign staff as\npossible. We were, passengers included, about forty persons. While we\nstood there, the ship mended her pace, and soon left her neighbour far\nbehind, which prov'd clearly what our captain suspected, that she was\nloaded too much by the head. The casks of water, it seems, had been all\nplac'd forward; these he therefore order'd to be mov'd further aft, on\nwhich the ship recover'd her character, and proved the sailer in the\nfleet.\n\nThe captain said she had once gone at the rate of thirteen knots, which\nis accounted thirteen miles per hour. We had on board, as a passenger,\nCaptain Kennedy, of the Navy, who contended that it was impossible, and\nthat no ship ever sailed so fast, and that there must have been some\nerror in the division of the log-line, or some mistake in heaving the\nlog. A wager ensu'd between the two captains, to be decided when there\nshould be sufficient wind. Kennedy thereupon examin'd rigorously the\nlog-line, and, being satisfi'd with that, he determin'd to throw the log\nhimself. Accordingly some days after, when the wind blew very fair and\nfresh, and the captain of the paquet, Lutwidge, said he believ'd she\nthen went at the rate of thirteen knots, Kennedy made the experiment,\nand own'd his wager lost.\n\nThe above fact I give for the sake of the following observation. It has\nbeen remark'd, as an imperfection in the art of ship-building, that it\ncan never be known, till she is tried, whether a new ship will or will\nnot be a good sailer; for that the model of a good-sailing ship has been\nexactly follow'd in a new one, which has prov'd, on the contrary,\nremarkably dull. I apprehend that this may partly be occasion'd by the\ndifferent opinions of seamen respecting the modes of lading, rigging,\nand sailing of a ship; each has his system; and the same vessel, laden\nby the judgment and orders of one captain, shall sail better or worse\nthan when by the orders of another. Besides, it scarce ever happens that\na ship is form'd, fitted for the sea, and sail'd by the same person. One\nman builds the hull, another rigs her, a third lades and sails her. No\none of these has the advantage of knowing all the ideas and experience\nof the others, and, therefore, can not draw just conclusions from a\ncombination of the whole.\n\nEven in the simple operation of sailing when at sea, I have often\nobserv'd different judgments in the officers who commanded the\nsuccessive watches, the wind being the same. One would have the sails\ntrimm'd sharper or flatter than another, so that they seem'd to have no\ncertain rule to govern by. Yet I think a set of experiments might be\ninstituted, first, to determine the most proper form of the hull for\nswift sailing; next, the best dimensions and properest place for the\nmasts: then the form and quantity of sails, and their position, as the\nwind may be; and, lastly, the disposition of the lading. This is an age\nof experiments, and I think a set accurately made and combin'd would be\nof great use. I am persuaded, therefore, that ere long some ingenious\nphilosopher will undertake it, to whom I wish success.\n\nWe were several times chas'd in our passage, but outsail'd every thing,\nand in thirty days had soundings. We had a good observation, and the\ncaptain judg'd himself so near our port, Falmouth, that, if we made a\ngood run in the night, we might be off the mouth of that harbor in the\nmorning, and by running in the night might escape the notice of the\nenemy's privateers, who often crus'd near the entrance of the channel.\nAccordingly, all the sail was set that we could possibly make, and the\nwind being very fresh and fair, we went right before it, and made great\nway. The captain, after his observation, shap'd his course, as he\nthought, so as to pass wide of the Scilly Isles; but it seems there is\nsometimes a strong indraught setting up St. George's Channel, which\ndeceives seamen and caused the loss of Sir Cloudesley Shovel's squadron.\nThis indraught was probably the cause of what happened to us.\n\nWe had a watchman plac'd in the bow, to whom they often called, \"Look\nwell out before there,\" and he as often answered, \"Ay ay;\" but perhaps\nhad his eyes shut, and was half asleep at the time, they sometimes\nanswering, as is said, mechanically; for he did not see a light just\nbefore us, which had been hid by the studdingsails from the man at the\nhelm, and from the rest of the watch, but by an accidental yaw of the\nship was discover'd, and occasion'd a great alarm, we being very near\nit, the light appearing to me as big as a cart-wheel. It was midnight,\nand our captain fast asleep; but Captain Kennedy, jumping upon deck, and\nseeing the danger, ordered the ship to wear round, all sails standing;\nan operation dangerous to the masts, but it carried us clear, and we\nescaped shipwreck, for we were running right upon the rocks on which the\nlight-house was erected. This deliverance impressed me strongly with the\nutility of light-houses, and made me resolve to encourage the building\nmore of them in America, if I should live to return there.\n\nIn the morning it was found by the soundings, etc., that we were near\nour port, but a thick fog hid the land from our sight. About nine\no'clock the fog began to rise, and seem'd to be lifted up from the water\nlike the curtain at a play-house, discovering underneath, the town of\nFalmouth, the vessels in its harbor, and the fields that surrounded it.\nThis was a most pleasing spectacle to those who had been so long without\nany other prospects than the uniform view of a vacant ocean, and it gave\nus the more pleasure as we were now free from the anxieties which the\nstate of war occasion'd.\n\nI set out immediately, with my son, for London, and we only stopt a\nlittle by the way to view Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain, and Lord\nPembroke's house and gardens, with his very curious antiquities at\nWilton. We arrived in London the 27th of July, 1757. [16]\n\n[16] Here terminates the Autobiography, as published by Wm. Temple\nFranklin and his successors. What follows was written in the last year\nof Dr. Franklin's life, and was first printed (in English) in Mr.\nBigelow's edition of 1868.--Ed.\n\nAs soon as I was settled in a lodging Mr. Charles had provided for me, I\nwent to visit Dr. Fothergill, to whom I was strongly recommended, and\nwhose counsel respecting my proceedings I was advis'd to obtain. He was\nagainst an immediate complaint to government, and thought the\nproprietaries should first be personally appli'd to, who might possibly\nbe induc'd by the interposition and persuasion of some private friends,\nto accommodate matters amicably. I then waited on my old friend and\ncorrespondent, Mr. Peter Collinson, who told me that John Hanbury, the\ngreat Virginia merchant, had requested to be informed when I should\narrive, that he might carry me to Lord Granville's, who was then\nPresident of the Council and wished to see me as soon as possible. I\nagreed to go with him the next morning. Accordingly Mr. Hanbury called\nfor me and took me in his carriage to that nobleman's, who receiv'd me\nwith great civility; and after some questions respecting the present\nstate of affairs in America and discourse thereupon, he said to me: \"You\nAmericans have wrong ideas of the nature of your constitution; you\ncontend that the king's instructions to his governors are not laws, and\nthink yourselves at liberty to regard or disregard them at your own\ndiscretion. But those instructions are not like the pocket instructions\ngiven to a minister going abroad, for regulating his conduct in some\ntrifling point of ceremony. They are first drawn up by judges learned in\nthe laws; they are then considered, debated, and perhaps amended in\nCouncil, after which they are signed by the king. They are then, so far\nas they relate to you, the law of the land, for the king is the\nLegislator of the Colonies.\" I told his lordship this was new doctrine\nto me. I had always understood from our charters that our laws were to\nbe made by our Assemblies, to be presented indeed to the king for his\nroyal assent, but that being once given the king could not repeal or\nalter them. And as the Assemblies could not make permanent laws without\nhis assent, so neither could he make a law for them without theirs. He\nassur'd me I was totally mistaken. I did not think so, however, and his\nlordship's conversation having a little alarm'd me as to what might be\nthe sentiments of the court concerning us, I wrote it down as soon as I\nreturn'd to my lodgings. I recollected that about 20 years before, a\nclause in a bill brought into Parliament by the ministry had propos'd to\nmake the king's instructions laws in the colonies, but the clause was\nthrown out by the Commons, for which we adored them as our friends and\nfriends of liberty, till by their conduct towards us in 1765 it seem'd\nthat they had refus'd that point of sovereignty to the king only that\nthey might reserve it for themselves.\n\nAfter some days, Dr. Fothergill having spoken to the proprietaries, they\nagreed to a meeting with me at Mr. T. Penn's house in Spring Garden. The\nconversation at first consisted of mutual declarations of disposition to\nreasonable accommodations, but I suppose each party had its own ideas of\nwhat should be meant by reasonable. We then went into consideration of\nour several points of complaint, which I enumerated. The proprietaries\njustify'd their conduct as well as they could, and I the Assembly's. We\nnow appeared very wide, and so far from each other in our opinions as to\ndiscourage all hope of agreement. However, it was concluded that I\nshould give them the heads of our complaints in writing, and they\npromis'd then to consider them. I did so soon after, but they put the\npaper into the hands of their solicitor, Ferdinand John Paris, who\nmanaged for them all their law business in their great suit with the\nneighbouring proprietary of Maryland, Lord Baltimore, which had\nsubsisted 70 years, and wrote for them all their papers and messages in\ntheir dispute with the Assembly. He was a proud, angry man, and as I had\noccasionally in the answers of the Assembly treated his papers with some\nseverity, they being really weak in point of argument and haughty in\nexpression, he had conceived a mortal enmity to me, which discovering\nitself whenever we met, I declin'd the proprietary's proposal that he\nand I should discuss the heads of complaint between our two selves, and\nrefus'd treating with any one but them. They then by his advice put the\npaper into the hands of the Attorney and Solicitor-General for their\nopinion and counsel upon it, where it lay unanswered a year wanting\neight days, during which time I made frequent demands of an answer from\nthe proprietaries, but without obtaining any other than that they had\nnot yet received the opinion of the Attorney and Solicitor-General. What\nit was when they did receive it I never learnt, for they did not\ncommunicate it to me, but sent a long message to the Assembly drawn and\nsigned by Paris, reciting my paper, complaining of its want of\nformality, as a rudeness on my part, and giving a flimsy justification\nof their conduct, adding that they should be willing to accommodate\nmatters if the Assembly would send out some person of candour to treat\nwith them for that purpose, intimating thereby that I was not such.\n\nThe want of formality or rudeness was, probably, my not having address'd\nthe paper to them with their assum'd titles of True and Absolute\nProprietaries of the Province of Pennsylvania, which I omitted as not\nthinking it necessary in a paper, the intention of which was only to\nreduce to a certainty by writing, what in conversation I had delivered\nviva voce.\n\nBut during this delay, the Assembly having prevailed with Gov'r Denny to\npass an act taxing the proprietary estate in common with the estates of\nthe people, which was the grand point in dispute, they omitted answering\nthe message.\n\nWhen this act however came over, the proprietaries, counselled by Paris,\ndetermined to oppose its receiving the royal assent. Accordingly they\npetition'd the king in Council, and a hearing was appointed in which two\nlawyers were employ'd by them against the act, and two by me in support\nof it. They alledg'd that the act was intended to load the proprietary\nestate in order to spare those of the people, and that if it were\nsuffer'd to continue in force, and the proprietaries who were in odium\nwith the people, left to their mercy in proportioning the taxes, they\nwould inevitably be ruined. We reply'd that the act had no such\nintention, and would have no such effect. That the assessors were honest\nand discreet men under an oath to assess fairly and equitably, and that\nany advantage each of them might expect in lessening his own tax by\naugmenting that of the proprietaries was too trifling to induce them to\nperjure themselves. This is the purport of what I remember as urged by\nboth sides, except that we insisted strongly on the mischievous\nconsequences that must attend a repeal, for that the money, £100,000,\nbeing printed and given to the king's use, expended in his service, and\nnow spread among the people, the repeal would strike it dead in their\nhands to the ruin of many, and the total discouragement of future\ngrants, and the selfishness of the proprietors in soliciting such a\ngeneral catastrophe, merely from a groundless fear of their estate being\ntaxed too highly, was insisted on in the strongest terms. On this, Lord\nMansfield, one of the counsel rose, and beckoning me took me into the\nclerk's chamber, while the lawyers were pleading, and asked me if I was\nreally of opinion that no injury would be done the proprietary estate in\nthe execution of the act. I said certainly. \"Then,\" says he, \"you can\nhave little objection to enter into an engagement to assure that point.\"\nI answer'd, \"None at all.\" He then call'd in Paris, and after some\ndiscourse, his lordship's proposition was accepted on both sides; a\npaper to the purpose was drawn up by the Clerk of the Council, which I\nsign'd with Mr. Charles, who was also an Agent of the Province for their\nordinary affairs, when Lord Mansfield returned to the Council Chamber,\nwhere finally the law was allowed to pass. Some changes were however\nrecommended and we also engaged they should be made by a subsequent law,\nbut the Assembly did not think them necessary; for one year's tax having\nbeen levied by the act before the order of Council arrived, they\nappointed a committee to examine the proceedings of the assessors, and\non this committee they put several particular friends of the\nproprietaries. After a full enquiry, they unanimously sign'd a report\nthat they found the tax had been assess'd with perfect equity.\n\nThe Assembly looked into my entering into the first part of the\nengagement, as an essential service to the Province, since it secured\nthe credit of the paper money then spread over all the country. They\ngave me their thanks in form when I return'd. But the proprietaries were\nenraged at Governor Denny for having pass'd the act, and turn'd him out\nwith threats of suing him for breach of instructions which he had given\nbond to observe.

[Unfinished].\n\nCHIEF EVENTS IN FRANKLIN'S LIFE.\n\n[Ending, as it does, with the year 1757, the autobiography leaves\nimportant facts unrecorded.

Editor.]\n\n\nOn Franklin's Autobiography\n\nAnd yet the surprising and delightful thing about this book (the\nAutobiography) is that, take it all in all, it has not the low tone of\nconceit, but is a staunch man's sober and unaffected assessment of\nhimself and the circumstances of his career.\n\nWoodrow Wilson\n\nSuch, for example, was Benjamin Franklin, whose charming autobiography,\nin addition to being an American classic, is a fine record of\nself-education.\n\nCharles A. Beard & Mary Ritter Beard\n\nFor understanding the temper and ideals of America in the eighteenth\ncentury, no writings are of equal importance with those of John Adams\nand Benjamin Franklin, especially the Diary of the former (Works of John\nAdams, 10 vols. Boston, 1856) and the Autobiography of the latter, in\nhis collected works and separately printed in many editions.\n\nCarl Lotus Becker\n\nNo man has shed such copious good influence on America; none added so\nmuch new truth to the popular knowledge; none has so skillfully\norganized its ideas into institutions; none has so powerfully and wisely\ndirected the nation's conduct, and advanced its welfare in so many\nrespects. No man now has so strong a hold on the habits and manners of\nthe people. Franklin comes home to the individual business of practical\nmen in their daily life.\n\nTheodore Parker\n\nThe Autobiography is also a uniquely American book. After a life like\nFranklin's had become possible and could be described matter-of-factly,\nthe Declaration of Independence seems understandable and much less\nrevolutionary.... There was in America a society which valued the things\nFranklin could do well: work hard, write effectively, plan improvements,\nconciliate differences, and conduct public affairs with popular needs\nand interests in view. His Autobiography records these achievements and\nvalues and habits which made them possible, and tells how a remarkable\nhuman being used his heritage and created a life on a new, revolutionary\nmodel.\n\nLeonard W. Labaree, Ralph L. Ketcham, Helen C. Boatfield, and Helene H.\nFineman\n\n[T]hose who know Franklin only in his Autobiography, charming as that\nclassic production is, have made but an imperfect acquaintance with the\nrange, the vitality, the vigor of this admirable craftsman who chose a\nstyle \"smooth, clear, and short,\" and made it serve every purpose of his\nversatile and beneficent mind.\n\nBliss Perry\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Notes\n\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThis version of the Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin was part of The\nHarvard Classics edition published by G. P. Putnam & Sons in 1909. The\nphysical book also included the Journal of John Woolman and Fruits of\nSolitude by William Penn. This document only contains the Autobiography\nof Benjamin Franklin. A scanned version of the physical book owned by\nthe Library of Congress is available through Hathitrust.\n\nScores of different editions of Franklin's Autobiography exist. Project\nGutenberg has the Pine edition, published by Henry Holt and Company in\n1916. Frank Woodworth Pine edited the Holt book and F. Boyd Smith\nillustrated the edition. Also available through PG is the Eclectic\nEnglish Classics version published in 1910. All three editions of\nFranklin's Autobiography in the PG collection are based on the Bigelow\nedition. See the section About the Autobiography in the Introduction of\nthe Pine edition for more background about the Bigelow edition.\n\n1.  Pine edition (1916)\n2.  Eclectic English Classics (1910)\n3.  Harvard Classics Edition (1909)\n\nWe have retained the original punctuation and spelling in the book, but\nthere are a few exceptions. See the Detailed Notes Section of these\nnotes for a list of changes. There are many misspelled words in this\nAutobiography, but we made three changes, which we believe were made by\nthe editor or publisher. After the three changes that we made, those\nsentences match the same sentence from the other two transcriptions of\nthe book in Project Gutenberg. The Detailed Notes Section also includes\nissues that have come up during transcription.\n\n\nProduction Notes Section:\n\nThis book contained no chapters and no table of contents.\n\nThe navigation tools on page 2 of this book were added by the\ntranscriber, in the hope of providing a better reading experience. The\nfour parts of this book correspond to the four parts of the\nAutobiography described in Wikipedia. Luckily, those four parts were the\nsame breaks that Mr. Eliot added in The Harvard Classics Edition.\n\nThe quotations of On Franklin's Autobiography were added by the\ntranscriber.\n\n\nDetailed Notes Section:\n\n• Page 43:\nSix-pence was hyphenated and split between two lines for spacing. In\nseveral other places, the word was written without the hyphen. There was\nthe retention of a hyphen in \"three half-pence\" on page 47. We did not\nretain the hyphen in transcribing the clause \"at three shillings and\nsixpence a week.\"\n• Page 51:\nChanged schoool to school in \"and open a swimming-schoool.\"\n• Page 56:\nBrick-makers was hyphenated and split between two lines for spacing. The\nword was not used again, but several different words using the same\nprefix or suffix were found: bricklayers, verse-makers, papermakers, and\ninstrument-makers. No pattern could be detected. The hyphen was retained\nfor no other reason than that was how it was originally transcribed, in\nthe clause \"by wheeling clay for the brick-makers.\"\n• Page 92:\nChanged propesed to proposed in \"when I propesed new institutions.\"\n• Page 125:\nChanged on to an in the clause \"and on accidental stroke on one of them\nwould demolish it.\""
