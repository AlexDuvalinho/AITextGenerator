I mean when I am\nasleep.  This dream is as it were a present of an architectural\npeep-show.  I see some beautiful and noble building new made, as it\nwere for the occasion, as clearly as if I were awake; not vaguely or\nabsurdly, as often happens in dreams, but with all the detail clear and\nreasonable.  Some Elizabethan house with its scrap of earlier\nfourteenth-century building, and its later degradations of Queen Anne\nand Silly Billy and Victoria, marring but not destroying it, in an old\nvillage once a clearing amid the sandy woodlands of Sussex.  Or an old\nand unusually curious church, much churchwardened, and beside it a\nfragment of fifteenth-century domestic architecture amongst the not\nunpicturesque lath and plaster of an Essex farm, and looking natural\nenough among the sleepy elms and the meditative hens scratching about\nin the litter of the farmyard, whose trodden yellow straw comes up to\nthe very jambs of the richly carved Norman doorway of the church.  Or\nsometimes 'tis a splendid collegiate church, untouched by restoring\nparson and architect, standing amid an island of shapely trees and\nflower-beset cottages of thatched grey stone and cob, amidst the narrow\nstretch of bright green water-meadows that wind between the sweeping\nWiltshire downs, so well beloved of William Cobbett. Or some new-seen\nand yet familiar cluster of houses in a grey village of the upper\nThames overtopped by the delicate tracery of a fourteenth-century\nchurch; or even sometimes the very buildings of the past untouched by\nthe degradation of the sordid utilitarianism that cares not and knows\nnot of beauty and history: as once, when I was journeying (in a dream\nof the night) down the well-remembered reaches of the Thames betwixt\nStreatley and Wallingford, where the foothills of the White Horse fall\nback from the broad stream, I came upon a clear-seen mediaeval town\nstanding up with roof and tower and spire within its walls, grey and\nancient, but untouched from the days of its builders of old. All this I\nhave seen in the dreams of the night clearer than I can force myself to\nsee them in dreams of the day.  So that it would have been nothing new\nto me the other night to fall into an architectural dream if that were\nall, and yet I have to tell of things strange and new that befell me\nafter I had fallen asleep. I had begun my sojourn in the Land of Nod by\na very confused attempt to conclude that it was all right for me to\nhave an engagement to lecture at Manchester and Mitcham Fair Green at\nhalf-past eleven at night on one and the same Sunday, and that I could\nmanage pretty well.  And then I had gone on to try to make the best of\naddressing a large open-air audience in the costume I was really then\nwearing--to wit, my night-shirt, reinforced for the dream occasion by a\npair of braceless trousers.  The consciousness of this fact so bothered\nme, that the earnest faces of my audience--who would NOT notice it, but\nwere clearly preparing terrible anti-Socialist posers for me--began to\nfade away and my dream grew thin, and I awoke (as I thought) to find\nmyself lying on a strip of wayside waste by an oak copse just outside a\ncountry village.\n\nI got up and rubbed my eyes and looked about me, and the landscape\nseemed unfamiliar to me, though it was, as to the lie of the land, an\nordinary English low-country, swelling into rising ground here and\nthere.  The road was narrow, and I was convinced that it was a piece of\nRoman road from its straightness.  Copses were scattered over the\ncountry, and there were signs of two or three villages and hamlets in\nsight besides the one near me, between which and me there was some\norchard-land, where the early apples were beginning to redden on the\ntrees.  Also, just on the other side of the road and the ditch which\nran along it, was a small close of about a quarter of an acre, neatly\nhedged with quick, which was nearly full of white poppies, and, as far\nas I could see for the hedge, had also a good few rose-bushes of the\nbright-red nearly single kind, which I had heard are the ones from\nwhich rose-water used to be distilled.  Otherwise the land was quite\nunhedged, but all under tillage of various kinds, mostly in small\nstrips.  From the other side of a copse not far off rose a tall spire\nwhite and brand-new, but at once bold in outline and unaffectedly\ngraceful and also distinctly English in character.  This, together with\nthe unhedged tillage and a certain unwonted trimness and handiness\nabout the enclosures of the garden and orchards, puzzled me for a\nminute or two, as I did not understand, new as the spire was, how it\ncould have been designed by a modern architect; and I was of course\nused to the hedged tillage and tumbledown bankrupt-looking surroundings\nof our modern agriculture.  So that the garden-like neatness and\ntrimness of everything surprised me.  But after a minute or two that\nsurprise left me entirely; and if what I saw and heard afterwards seems\nstrange to you, remember that it did not seem strange to me at the\ntime, except where now and again I shall tell you of it.  Also, once\nfor all, if I were to give you the very words of those who spoke to me\nyou would scarcely understand them, although their language was English\ntoo, and at the time I could understand them at once.\n\nWell, as I stretched myself and turned my face toward the village, I\nheard horse-hoofs on the road, and presently a man and horse showed on\nthe other end of the stretch of road and drew near at a swinging trot\nwith plenty of clash of metal.  The man soon came up to me, but paid me\nno more heed than throwing me a nod.  He was clad in armour of mingled\nsteel and leather, a sword girt to his side, and over his shoulder a\nlong-handled bill-hook.\n\nHis armour was fantastic in form and well wrought; but by this time I\nwas quite used to the strangeness of him, and merely muttered to\nmyself, \"He is coming to summon the squire to the leet;\" so I turned\ntoward the village in good earnest.  Nor, again, was I surprised at my\nown garments, although I might well have been from their unwontedness.\nI was dressed in a black cloth gown reaching to my ankles, neatly\nembroidered about the collar and cuffs, with wide sleeves gathered in\nat the wrists; a hood with a sort of bag hanging down from it was on my\nhead, a broad red leather girdle round my waist, on one side of which\nhung a pouch embroidered very prettily and a case made of hard leather\nchased with a hunting scene, which I knew to be a pen and ink case; on\nthe other side a small sheath-knife, only an arm in case of dire\nnecessity.\n\nWell, I came into the village, where I did not see (nor by this time\nexpected to see) a single modern building, although many of them were\nnearly new, notably the church, which was large, and quite ravished my\nheart with its extreme beauty, elegance, and fitness.  The chancel of\nthis was so new that the dust of the stone still lay white on the\nmidsummer grass beneath the carvings of the windows.  The houses were\nalmost all built of oak frame-work filled with cob or plaster well\nwhitewashed; though some had their lower stories of rubble-stone, with\ntheir windows and doors of well-moulded freestone.  There was much\ncurious and inventive carving about most of them; and though some were\nold and much worn, there was the same look of deftness and trimness,\nand even beauty, about every detail in them which I noticed before in\nthe field-work.  They were all roofed with oak shingles, mostly grown\nas grey as stone; but one was so newly built that its roof was yet pale\nand yellow.  This was a corner house, and the corner post of it had a\ncarved niche wherein stood a gaily painted figure holding an\nanchor--St. Clement to wit, as the dweller in the house was a\nblacksmith.  Half a stone's throw from the east end of the churchyard\nwall was a tall cross of stone, new like the church, the head\nbeautifully carved with a crucifix amidst leafage.  It stood on a set\nof wide stone steps, octagonal in shape, where three roads from other\nvillages met and formed a wide open space on which a thousand people or\nmore could stand together with no great crowding.\n\nAll this I saw, and also that there was a goodish many people about,\nwomen and children, and a few old men at the doors, many of them\nsomewhat gaily clad, and that men were coming into the village street\nby the other end to that by which I had entered, by twos and threes,\nmost of them carrying what I could see were bows in cases of linen\nyellow with wax or oil; they had quivers at their backs, and most of\nthem a short sword by their left side, and a pouch and knife on the\nright; they were mostly dressed in red or brightish green or blue cloth\njerkins, with a hood on the head generally of another colour.  As they\ncame nearer I saw that the cloth of their garments was somewhat coarse,\nbut stout and serviceable.  I knew, somehow, that they had been\nshooting at the butts, and, indeed, I could still hear a noise of men\nthereabout, and even now and again when the wind set from that quarter\nthe twang of the bowstring and the plump of the shaft in the target.\n\nI leaned against the churchyard wall and watched these men, some of\nwhom went straight into their houses and some loitered about still;\nthey were rough-looking fellows, tall and stout, very black some of\nthem, and some red-haired, but most had hair burnt by the sun into the\ncolour of tow; and, indeed, they were all burned and tanned and\nfreckled variously.  Their arms and buckles and belts and the\nfinishings and hems of their garments were all what we should now call\nbeautiful, rough as the men were; nor in their speech was any of that\ndrawling snarl or thick vulgarity which one is used to hear from\nlabourers in civilisation; not that they talked like gentlemen either,\nbut full and round and bold, and they were merry and good-tempered\nenough; I could see that, though I felt shy and timid amongst them.\n\nOne of them strode up to me across the road, a man some six feet high,\nwith a short black beard and black eyes and berry-brown skin, with a\nhuge bow in his hand bare of the case, a knife, a pouch, and a short\nhatchet, all clattering together at his girdle.\n\n\"Well, friend,\" said he, \"thou lookest partly mazed; what tongue hast\nthou in thine head?\"\n\n\"A tongue that can tell rhymes,\" said I.\n\n\"So I thought,\" said he.  \"Thirstest thou any?\"\n\n\"Yea, and hunger,\" said I.\n\nAnd therewith my hand went into my purse, and came out again with but a\nfew small and thin silver coins with a cross stamped on each, and three\npellets in each corner of the cross.  The man grinned.\n\n\"Aha!\" said he, \"is it so?  Never heed it, mate.  It shall be a song\nfor a supper this fair Sunday evening.  But first, whose man art thou?\"\n\n\"No one's man,\" said I, reddening angrily; \"I am my own master.\"\n\nHe grinned again.\n\n\"Nay, that's not the custom of England, as one time belike it will be.\nMethinks thou comest from heaven down, and hast had a high place there\ntoo.\"\n\nHe seemed to hesitate a moment, and then leant forward and whispered in\nmy ear:  \"John the Miller, that ground small, small, small,\" and\nstopped and winked at me, and from between my lips without my mind\nforming any meaning came the words, \"The king's son of heaven shall pay\nfor all.\"\n\nHe let his bow fall on to his shoulder, caught my right hand in his and\ngave it a great grip, while his left hand fell among the gear at his\nbelt, and I could see that he half drew his knife.\n\n\"Well, brother,\" said he, \"stand not here hungry in the highway when\nthere is flesh and bread in the Rose yonder.  Come on.\"\n\nAnd with that he drew me along toward what was clearly a tavern door,\noutside which men were sitting on a couple of benches and drinking\nmeditatively from curiously shaped earthen pots glazed green and\nyellow, some with quaint devices on them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE MAN FROM ESSEX\n\nI entered the door and started at first with my old astonishment, with\nwhich I had woke up, so strange and beautiful did this interior seem to\nme, though it was but a pothouse parlour.  A quaintly-carved side board\nheld an array of bright pewter pots and dishes and wooden and earthen\nbowls; a stout oak table went up and down the room, and a carved oak\nchair stood by the chimney-corner, now filled by a very old man\ndim-eyed and white-bearded.  That, except the rough stools and benches\non which the company sat, was all the furniture.  The walls were\npanelled roughly enough with oak boards to about six feet from the\nfloor, and about three feet of plaster above that was wrought in a\npattern of a rose stem running all round the room, freely and roughly\ndone, but with (as it seemed to my unused eyes) wonderful skill and\nspirit.  On the hood of the great chimney a huge rose was wrought in\nthe plaster and brightly painted in its proper colours.  There were a\ndozen or more of the men I had seen coming along the street sitting\nthere, some eating and all drinking; their cased bows leaned against\nthe wall, their quivers hung on pegs in the panelling, and in a corner\nof the room I saw half-a-dozen bill-hooks that looked made more for war\nthan for hedge-shearing, with ashen handles some seven foot long.\nThree or four children were running about among the legs of the men,\nheeding them mighty little in their bold play, and the men seemed\nlittle troubled by it, although they were talking earnestly and\nseriously too.  A well-made comely girl leaned up against the chimney\nclose to the gaffer's chair, and seemed to be in waiting on the\ncompany: she was clad in a close-fitting gown of bright blue cloth,\nwith a broad silver girdle daintily wrought, round her loins, a rose\nwreath was on her head and her hair hung down unbound; the gaffer\ngrumbled a few words to her from time to time, so that I judged he was\nher grandfather.\n\nThe men all looked up as we came into the room, my mate leading me by\nthe hand, and he called out in his rough, good-tempered voice, \"Here,\nmy masters, I bring you tidings and a tale; give it meat and drink that\nit may be strong and sweet.\"\n\n\"Whence are thy tidings, Will Green?\" said one.\n\nMy mate grinned again with the pleasure of making his joke once more in\na bigger company:  \"It seemeth from heaven, since this good old lad\nhath no master,\" said he.\n\n\"The more fool he to come here,\" said a thin man with a grizzled beard,\namidst the laughter that followed, \"unless he had the choice given him\nbetween hell and England.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said I, \"I come not from heaven, but from Essex.\"\n\nAs I said the word a great shout sprang from all mouths at once, as\nclear and sudden as a shot from a gun.  For I must tell you that I knew\nsomehow, but I know not how, that the men of Essex were gathering to\nrise against the poll-groat bailiffs and the lords that would turn them\nall into villeins again, as their grandfathers had been.  And the\npeople was weak and the lords were poor; for many a mother's son had\nfallen in the war in France in the old king's time, and the Black Death\nhad slain a many; so that the lords had bethought them:  \"We are\ngrowing poorer, and these upland-bred villeins are growing richer, and\nthe guilds of craft are waxing in the towns, and soon what will there\nbe left for us who cannot weave and will not dig?  Good it were if we\nfell on all who are not guildsmen or men of free land, if we fell on\nsoccage tenants and others, and brought both the law and the strong\nhand on them, and made them all villeins in deed as they are now in\nname; for now these rascals make more than their bellies need of bread,\nand their backs of homespun, and the overplus they keep to themselves;\nand we are more worthy of it than they.  So let us get the collar on\ntheir necks again, and make their day's work longer and their\nbever-time shorter, as the good statute of the old king bade.  And good\nit were if the Holy Church were to look to it (and the Lollards might\nhelp herein) that all these naughty and wearisome holidays were done\naway with; or that it should be unlawful for any man below the degree\nof a squire to keep the holy days of the church, except in the heart\nand the spirit only, and let the body labour meanwhile; for does not\nthe Apostle say, 'If a man work not, neither should he eat'?  And if\nsuch things were done, and such an estate of noble rich men and worthy\npoor men upholden for ever, then would it be good times in England, and\nlife were worth the living.\"\n\nAll this were the lords at work on, and such talk I knew was common not\nonly among the lords themselves, but also among their sergeants and\nvery serving-men.  But the people would not abide it; therefore, as I\nsaid, in Essex they were on the point of rising, and word had gone how\nthat at St. Albans they were wellnigh at blows with the Lord Abbot's\nsoldiers; that north away at Norwich John Litster was wiping the woad\nfrom his arms, as who would have to stain them red again, but not with\ngrain or madder; and that the valiant tiler of Dartford had smitten a\npoll-groat bailiff to death with his lath-rending axe for mishandling a\nyoung maid, his daughter; and that the men of Kent were on the move.\n\nNow, knowing all this I was not astonished that they shouted at the\nthought of their fellows the men of Essex, but rather that they said\nlittle more about it; only Will Green saying quietly, \"Well, the\ntidings shall be told when our fellowship is greater; fall-to now on\nthe meat, brother, that we may the sooner have thy tale.\"  As he spoke\nthe blue-clad damsel bestirred herself and brought me a clean\ntrencher--that is, a square piece of thin oak board scraped clean--and\na pewter pot of liquor.  So without more ado, and as one used to it, I\ndrew my knife out of my girdle and cut myself what I would of the flesh\nand bread on the table.  But Will Green mocked at me as I cut, and\nsaid, \"Certes, brother, thou hast not been a lord's carver, though but\nfor thy word thou mightest have been his reader.  Hast thou seen\nOxford, scholar?\"\n\nA vision of grey-roofed houses and a long winding street and the sound\nof many bells came over me at that word as I nodded \"Yes\" to him, my\nmouth full of salt pork and rye-bread; and then I lifted my pot and we\nmade the clattering mugs kiss and I drank, and the fire of the good\nKentish mead ran through my veins and deepened my dream of things past,\npresent, and to come, as I said:  \"Now hearken a tale, since ye will\nhave it so.  For last autumn I was in Suffolk at the good town of\nDunwich, and thither came the keels from Iceland, and on them were some\nmen of Iceland, and many a tale they had on their tongues; and with\nthese men I foregathered, for I am in sooth a gatherer of tales, and\nthis that is now at my tongue's end is one of them.\"\n\nSo such a tale I told them, long familiar to me; but as I told it the\nwords seemed to quicken and grow, so that I knew not the sound of my\nown voice, and they ran almost into rhyme and measure as I told it; and\nwhen I had done there was silence awhile, till one man spake, but not\nloudly:\n\n\"Yea, in that land was the summer short and the winter long; but men\nlived both summer and winter; and if the trees grew ill and the corn\nthrove not, yet did the plant called man thrive and do well.  God send\nus such men even here.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said another, \"such men have been and will be, and belike are\nnot far from this same door even now.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said a third, \"hearken a stave of Robin Hood; maybe that shall\nhasten the coming of one I wot of.\"  And he fell to singing in a clear\nvoice, for he was a young man, and to a sweet wild melody, one of those\nballads which in an incomplete and degraded form you have read perhaps.\nMy heart rose high as I heard him, for it was concerning the struggle\nagainst tyranny for the freedom of life, how that the wildwood and the\nheath, despite of wind and weather, were better for a free man than the\ncourt and the cheaping-town; of the taking from the rich to give to the\npoor; of the life of a man doing his own will and not the will of\nanother man commanding him for the commandment's sake.  The men all\nlistened eagerly, and at whiles took up as a refrain a couplet at the\nend of a stanza with their strong and rough, but not unmusical voices.\nAs they sang, a picture of the wild-woods passed by me, as they were\nindeed, no park-like dainty glades and lawns, but rough and tangled\nthicket and bare waste and heath, solemn under the morning sun, and\ndreary with the rising of the evening wind and the drift of the\nnight-long rain.\n\nWhen he had done, another began in something of the same strain, but\nsinging more of a song than a story ballad; and thus much I remember of\nit:\n\n        The Sheriff is made a mighty lord,\n            Of goodly gold he hath enow,\n        And many a sergeant girt with sword;\n            But forth will we and bend the bow.\n                We shall bend the bow on the lily lea\n                Betwixt the thorn and the oaken tree.\n\n        With stone and lime is the burg wall built,\n            And pit and prison are stark and strong,\n        And many a true man there is spilt,\n            And many a right man doomed by wrong.\n\n            So forth shall we and bend the bow\n                And the king's writ never the road shall know.\n\n        Now yeomen walk ye warily,\n            And heed ye the houses where ye go,\n        For as fair and as fine as they may be,\n            Lest behind your heels the door clap to.\n                Fare forth with the bow to the lily lea\n                Betwixt the thorn and the oaken tree.\n\n        Now bills and bows I and out a-gate!\n            And turn about on the lily lea!\n        And though their company be great\n            The grey-goose wing shall set us free.\n                Now bent is the bow in the green abode\n                And the king's writ knoweth not the road.\n\n        So over the mead and over the hithe,\n            And away to the wild-wood wend we forth;\n        There dwell we yeomen bold and blithe\n            Where the Sheriff's word is nought of worth.\n                Bent is the bow on the lily lea\n                Betwixt the thorn and the oaken tree.\n\nBut here the song dropped suddenly, and one of the men held up his hand\nas who would say, Hist!  Then through the open window came the sound of\nanother song, gradually swelling as though sung by men on the march.\nThis time the melody was a piece of the plain-song of the church,\nfamiliar enough to me to bring back to my mind the great arches of some\ncathedral in France and the canons singing in the choir.\n\nAll leapt up and hurried to take their bows from wall and corner; and\nsome had bucklers withal, circles of leather, boiled and then moulded\ninto shape and hardened: these were some two hand-breadths across, with\niron or brass bosses in the centre.  Will Green went to the corner\nwhere the bills leaned against the wall and handed them round to the\nfirst-comers as far as they would go, and out we all went gravely and\nquietly into the village street and the fair sunlight of the calm\nafternoon, now beginning to turn towards evening.  None had said\nanything since we first heard the new-come singing, save that as we\nwent out of the door the ballad-singer clapped me on the shoulder and\nsaid: \"Was it not sooth that I said, brother, that Robin Hood should\nbring us John Ball?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHEY MEET AT THE CROSS\n\nThe street was pretty full of men by then we were out in it, and all\nfaces turned toward the cross.  The song still grew nearer and louder,\nand even as we looked we saw it turning the corner through the hedges\nof the orchards and closes, a good clump of men, more armed, as it\nwould seem, than our villagers, as the low sun flashed back from many\npoints of bright iron and steel.  The words of the song could now be\nheard, and amidst them I could pick out Will Green's late challenge to\nme and my answer; but as I was bending all my mind to disentangle more\nwords from the music, suddenly from the new white tower behind us\nclashed out the church bells, harsh and hurried at first, but presently\nfalling into measured chime; and at the first sound of them a great\nshout went up from us and was echoed by the new-comers, \"John Ball hath\nrung our bell!\"  Then we pressed on, and presently we were all mingled\ntogether at the cross.\n\nWill Green had good-naturedly thrust and pulled me forward, so that I\nfound myself standing on the lowest step of the cross, his seventy-two\ninches of man on one side of me.  He chuckled while I panted, and said:\n\n\"There's for thee a good hearing and seeing stead, old lad.  Thou art\ntall across thy belly and not otherwise, and thy wind, belike, is none\nof the best, and but for me thou wouldst have been amidst the thickest\nof the throng, and have heard words muffled by Kentish bellies and seen\nlittle but swinky woollen elbows and greasy plates and jacks.  Look no\nmore on the ground, as though thou sawest a hare, but let thine eyes\nand thine ears be busy to gather tidings to bear back to Essex--or\nheaven!\"\n\nI grinned good-fellowship at him but said nothing, for in truth my eyes\nand ears were as busy as he would have them to be.  A buzz of general\ntalk went up from the throng amidst the regular cadence of the bells,\nwhich now seemed far away and as it were that they were not swayed by\nhands, but were living creatures making that noise of their own wills.\n\nI looked around and saw that the newcomers mingled with us must have\nbeen a regular armed band; all had bucklers slung at their backs, few\nlacked a sword at the side.  Some had bows, some \"staves\"--that is,\nbills, pole-axes, or pikes.  Moreover, unlike our villagers, they had\ndefensive arms.  Most had steel-caps on their heads, and some had body\narmour, generally a \"jack,\" or coat into which pieces of iron or horn\nwere quilted; some had also steel or steel-and-leather arm or thigh\npieces.  There were a few mounted men among them, their horses being\nbig-boned hammer-headed beasts, that looked as if they had been taken\nfrom plough or waggon, but their riders were well armed with steel\narmour on their heads, legs, and arms.  Amongst the horsemen I noted\nthe man that had ridden past me when I first awoke; but he seemed to be\na prisoner, as he had a woollen hood on his head instead of his helmet,\nand carried neither bill, sword, nor dagger.  He seemed by no means\nill-at-ease, however, but was laughing and talking with the men who\nstood near him.\n\nAbove the heads of the crowd, and now slowly working towards the cross,\nwas a banner on a high-raised cross-pole, a picture of a man and woman\nhalf-clad in skins of beasts seen against a background of green trees,\nthe man holding a spade and the woman a distaff and spindle rudely done\nenough, but yet with a certain spirit and much meaning; and underneath\nthis symbol of the early world and man's first contest with nature were\nthe written words:\n\n            When Adam delved and Eve span\n            Who was then the gentleman?\n\n\nThe banner came on and through the crowd, which at last opened where we\nstood for its passage, and the banner-bearer turned and faced the\nthrong and stood on the first step of the cross beside me.\n\nA man followed him, clad in a long dark-brown gown of coarse woollen,\ngirt with a cord, to which hung a \"pair of beads\" (or rosary, as we\nshould call it to-day) and a book in a bag.  The man was tall and\nbig-boned, a ring of dark hair surrounded his priest's tonsure; his\nnose was big but clear cut and with wide nostrils; his shaven face\nshowed a longish upper lip and a big but blunt chin; his mouth was big\nand the lips closed firmly; a face not very noteworthy but for his grey\neyes well opened and wide apart, at whiles lighting up his whole face\nwith a kindly smile, at whiles set and stern, at whiles resting in that\nlook as if they were gazing at something a long way off, which is the\nwont of the eyes of the poet or enthusiast.\n\nHe went slowly up the steps of the cross and stood at the top with one\nhand laid on the shaft, and shout upon shout broke forth from the\nthrong.  When the shouting died away into a silence of the human\nvoices, the bells were still quietly chiming with that far-away voice\nof theirs, and the long-winged dusky swifts, by no means scared by the\nconcourse, swung round about the cross with their wild squeals; and the\nman stood still for a little, eyeing the throng, or rather looking\nfirst at one and then another man in it, as though he were trying to\nthink what such an one was thinking of, or what he were fit for.\nSometimes he caught the eye of one or other, and then that kindly smile\nspread over his face, but faded off it into the sternness and sadness\nof a man who has heavy and great thoughts hanging about him.  But when\nJohn Ball first mounted the steps of the cross a lad at some one's\nbidding had run off to stop the ringers, and so presently the voice of\nthe bells fell dead, leaving on men's minds that sense of blankness or\neven disappointment which is always caused by the sudden stopping of a\nsound one has got used to and found pleasant.  But a great expectation\nhad fallen by now on all that throng, and no word was spoken even in a\nwhisper, and all men's hearts and eyes were fixed upon the dark figure\nstanding straight up now by the tall white shaft of the cross, his\nhands stretched out before him, one palm laid upon the other.\n\nAnd for me, as I made ready to hearken, I felt a joy in my soul that I\nhad never yet felt.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE VOICE OF JOHN BALL\n\nSO now I heard John Ball; how he lifted up his voice and said:\n\n\"Ho, all ye good people!  I am a priest of God, and in my day's work it\ncometh that I should tell you what ye should do, and what ye should\nforbear doing, and to that end I am come hither: yet first, if I myself\nhave wronged any man here, let him say wherein my wrongdoing lieth,\nthat I may ask his pardon and his pity.\"\n\nA great hum of good-will ran through the crowd as he spoke; then he\nsmiled as in a kind of pride, and again he spoke:\n\n\"Wherefore did ye take me out of the archbishop's prison but three days\nagone, when ye lighted the archbishop's house for the candle of\nCanterbury, but that I might speak to you and pray you: therefore I\nwill not keep silence, whether I have done ill, or whether I have done\nwell.  And herein, good fellows and my very brethren, I would have you\nto follow me; and if there be such here, as I know full well there be\nsome, and may be a good many, who have been robbers of their neighbours\n('And who is my neighbour?' quoth the rich man), or lechers, or\ndespiteful haters, or talebearers, or fawners on rich men for the hurt\nof the poor (and that is the worst of all)--Ah, my poor brethren who\nhave gone astray, I say not to you, go home and repent lest you mar our\ngreat deeds, but rather come afield and there repent.  Many a day have\nye been fools, but hearken unto me and I shall make you wise above the\nwisdom of the earth; and if ye die in your wisdom, as God wot ye well\nmay, since the fields ye wend to bear swords for daisies, and spears\nfor bents, then shall ye be, though men call you dead, a part and\nparcel of the living wisdom of all things, very stones of the pillars\nthat uphold the joyful earth.\n\n\"Forsooth, ye have heard it said that ye shall do well in this world\nthat in the world to come ye may live happily for ever; do ye well\nthen, and have your reward both on earth and in heaven; for I say to\nyou that earth and heaven are not two but one; and this one is that\nwhich ye know, and are each one of you a part of, to wit, the Holy\nChurch, and in each one of you dwelleth the life of the Church, unless\nye slay it.  Forsooth, brethren, will ye murder the Church any one of\nyou, and go forth a wandering man and lonely, even as Cain did who slew\nhis brother?  Ah, my brothers, what an evil doom is this, to be an\noutcast from the Church, to have none to love you and to speak with\nyou, to be without fellowship!  Forsooth, brothers, fellowship is\nheaven, and lack of fellowship is hell: fellowship is life, and lack of\nfellowship is death: and the deeds that ye do upon the earth, it is for\nfellowship's sake that ye do them, and the life that is in it, that\nshall live on and on for ever, and each one of you part of it, while\nmany a man's life upon the earth from the earth shall wane.\n\n\"Therefore, I bid you not dwell in hell but in heaven, or while ye\nmust, upon earth, which is a part of heaven, and forsooth no foul part.\n\n\"Forsooth, he that waketh in hell and feeleth his heart fail him, shall\nhave memory of the merry days of earth, and how that when his heart\nfailed him there, he cried on his fellow, were it his wife or his son\nor his brother or his gossip or his brother sworn in arms, and how that\nhis fellow heard him and came and they mourned together under the sun,\ntill again they laughed together and were but half sorry between them.\nThis shall he think on in hell, and cry on his fellow to help him, and\nshall find that therein is no help because there is no fellowship, but\nevery man for himself.  Therefore, I tell you that the proud,\ndespiteous rich man, though he knoweth it not, is in hell already,\nbecause he hath no fellow; and he that hath so hardy a heart that in\nsorrow he thinketh of fellowship, his sorrow is soon but a story of\nsorrow--a little change in the life that knows not ill.\"\n\nHe left off for a little; and indeed for some time his voice had\nfallen, but it was so clear and the summer evening so soft and still,\nand the silence of the folk so complete, that every word told.  His\neyes fell down to the crowd as he stopped speaking, since for some\nlittle while they had been looking far away into the blue distance of\nsummer; and the kind eyes of the man had a curious sight before him in\nthat crowd, for amongst them were many who by this time were not\ndry-eyed, and some wept outright in spite of their black beards, while\nall had that look as if they were ashamed of themselves, and did not\nwant others to see how deeply they were moved, after the fashion of\ntheir race when they are strongly stirred.  I looked at Will Green\nbeside me: his right hand clutched his bow so tight, that the knuckles\nwhitened; he was staring straight before him, and the tears were\nrunning out of his eyes and down his big nose as though without his\nwill, for his face was stolid and unmoved all the time till he caught\nmy eye, and then he screwed up the strangest face, of scowling brow,\nweeping eyes, and smiling mouth, while he dealt me a sounding thump in\nthe ribs with his left elbow, which, though it would have knocked me\ndown but for the crowd, I took as an esquire does the accolade which\nmakes a knight of him.\n\nBut while I pondered all these things, and how men fight and lose the\nbattle, and the thing that they fought for comes about in spite of\ntheir defeat, and when it comes turns out not to be what they meant,\nand other men have to fight for what they meant under another name--\nwhile I pondered all this, John Ball began to speak again in the same\nsoft and dear voice with which he had left off.\n\n\"Good fellows, it was your fellowship and your kindness that took me\nout of the archbishop's prison three days agone, though God wot ye had\nnought to gain by it save outlawry and the gallows; yet lacked I not\nyour fellowship before ye drew near me in the body, and when between me\nand Canterbury street was yet a strong wall, and the turnkeys and\nsergeants and bailiffs.\n\n\"For hearken, my friends and helpers; many days ago, when April was yet\nyoung, I lay there, and the heart that I had strung up to bear all\nthings because of the fellowship of men and the blessed saints and the\nangels and those that are, and those that are to be, this heart, that I\nhad strung up like a strong bow, fell into feebleness, so that I lay\nthere a-longing for the green fields and the white-thorn bushes and the\nlark singing over the corn, and the talk of good fellows round the\nale-house bench, and the babble of the little children, and the team on\nthe road and the beasts afield, and all the life of earth; and I alone\nall the while, near my foes and afar from my friends, mocked and\nflouted and starved with cold and hunger; and so weak was my heart that\nthough I longed for all these things yet I saw them not, nor knew them\nbut as names; and I longed so sore to be gone that I chided myself that\nI had once done well; and I said to myself:\n\n\"Forsooth, hadst thou kept thy tongue between thy teeth thou mightest\nhave been something, if it had been but a parson of a town, and\ncomfortable to many a poor man; and then mightest thou have clad here\nand there the naked back, and filled the empty belly, and holpen many,\nand men would have spoken well of thee, and of thyself thou hadst\nthought well; and all this hast thou lost for lack of a word here and\nthere to some great man, and a little winking of the eyes amidst murder\nand wrong and unruth; and now thou art nought and helpless, and the\nhemp for thee is sown and grown and heckled and spun, and lo there, the\nrope for thy gallows-tree!--all for nought, for nought.\n\n\"Forsooth, my friends, thus I thought and sorrowed in my feebleness\nthat I had not been a traitor to the Fellowship of the Church, for e'en\nso evil was my foolish imagination.\n\n\"Yet, forsooth, as I fell a-pondering over all the comfort and help\nthat I might have been and that I might have had, if I had been but a\nlittle of a trembling cur to creep and crawl before abbot and bishop\nand baron and bailiff, came the thought over me of the evil of the\nworld wherewith I, John Ball, the rascal hedge-priest, had fought and\nstriven in the Fellowship of the saints in heaven and poor men upon\nearth.\n\n\"Yea, forsooth, once again I saw as of old, the great treading down the\nlittle, and the strong beating down the weak, and cruel men fearing\nnot, and kind men daring not, and wise men caring not; and the saints\nin heaven forbearing and yet bidding me not to forbear; forsooth, I\nknew once more that he who doeth well in fellowship, and because of\nfellowship, shall not fail though he seem to fail to-day, but in days\nhereafter shall he and his work yet be alive, and men be holpen by them\nto strive again and yet again; and yet indeed even that was little,\nsince, forsooth, to strive was my pleasure and my life.\n\n\"So I became a man once more, and I rose up to my feet and went up and\ndown my prison what I could for my hopples, and into my mouth came\nwords of good cheer, even such as we to-day have sung, and stoutly I\nsang them, even as we now have sung them; and then did I rest me, and\nonce more thought of those pleasant fields where I would be, and all\nthe life of man and beast about them, and I said to myself that I\nshould see them once more before I died, if but once it were.\n\n\"Forsooth, this was strange, that whereas before I longed for them and\nyet saw them not, now that my longing was slaked my vision was cleared,\nand I saw them as though the prison walls opened to me and I was out of\nCanterbury street and amidst the green meadows of April; and\ntherewithal along with me folk that I have known and who are dead, and\nfolk that are living; yea, and all those of the Fellowship on earth and\nin heaven; yea, and all that are here this day.  Overlong were the tale\nto tell of them, and of the time that is gone.\n\n\"So thenceforward I wore through the days with no such faint heart,\nuntil one day the prison opened verily and in the daylight, and there\nwere ye, my fellows, in the door--your faces glad, your hearts light\nwith hope, and your hands heavy with wrath; then I saw and understood\nwhat was to do.  Now, therefore, do ye understand it!\"\n\nHis voice was changed, and grew louder than loud now, as he cast his\nhands abroad towards that company with those last words of his; and I\ncould feel that all shame and fear was falling from those men, and that\nmere fiery manhood was shining through their wonted English shamefast\nstubbornness, and that they were moved indeed and saw the road before\nthem.  Yet no man spoke, rather the silence of the men-folk deepened,\nas the sun's rays grew more level and more golden, and the swifts\nwheeled about shriller and louder than before.\n\nThen again John Ball spoke and said, \"In good sooth, I deem ye wot no\nworse than I do what is to do--and first that somewhat we shall do--\nsince it is for him that is lonely or in prison to dream of fellowship,\nbut for him that is of a fellowship to do and not to dream.\n\n\"And next, ye know who is the foeman, and that is the proud man, the\noppressor, who scorneth fellowship, and himself is a world to himself\nand needeth no helper nor helpeth any, but, heeding no law, layeth law\non other men because he is rich; and surely every one that is rich is\nsuch an one, nor may be other.\n\n\"Forsooth, in the belly of every rich man dwelleth a devil of hell, and\nwhen the man would give his goods to the poor, the devil within him\ngainsayeth it, and saith, 'Wilt thou then be of the poor, and suffer\ncold and hunger and mocking as they suffer, then give thou thy goods to\nthem, and keep them not.'  And when he would be compassionate, again\nsaith the devil to him, 'If thou heed these losels and turn on them a\nface like to their faces, and deem of them as men, then shall they\nscorn thee, and evil shall come of it, and even one day they shall fall\non thee to slay thee when they have learned that thou art but as they\nbe.'\n\n\"Ah, woe worth the while! too oft he sayeth sooth, as the wont of the\ndevil is, that lies may be born of the barren truth; and sooth it is\nthat the poor deemeth the rich to be other than he, and meet to be his\nmaster, as though, forsooth, the poor were come of Adam, and the rich\nof him that made Adam, that is God; and thus the poor man oppresseth\nthe poor man, because he feareth the oppressor.  Nought such are ye, my\nbrethren; or else why are ye gathered here in harness to bid all bear\nwitness of you that ye are the sons of one man and one mother, begotten\nof the earth?\"\n\nAs he said the words there came a stir among the weapons of the throng,\nand they pressed closer round the cross, yet with held the shout as yet\nwhich seemed gathering in their bosoms.\n\nAnd again he said:\n\n\"Forsooth, too many rich men there are in this realm; and yet if there\nwere but one, there would be one too many, for all should be his\nthralls.  Hearken, then, ye men of Kent.  For overlong belike have I\nheld you with words; but the love of you constrained me, and the joy\nthat a man hath to babble to his friends and his fellows whom he hath\nnot seen for a long season.\n\n\"Now, hearken, I bid you:  To the rich men that eat up a realm there\ncometh a time when they whom they eat up, that is the poor, seem poorer\nthan of wont, and their complaint goeth up louder to the heavens; yet\nit is no riddle to say that oft at such times the fellowship of the\npoor is waxing stronger, else would no man have heard his cry.  Also at\nsuch times is the rich man become fearful, and so waxeth in cruelty,\nand of that cruelty do people misdeem that it is power and might\nwaxing.  Forsooth, ye are stronger than your fathers, because ye are\nmore grieved than they, and ye should have been less grieved than they\nhad ye been horses and swine; and then, forsooth, would ye have been\nstronger to bear; but ye, ye are not strong to bear, but to do.\n\n\"And wot ye why we are come to you this fair eve of holiday? and wot ye\nwhy I have been telling of fellowship to you?  Yea, forsooth, I deem ye\nwot well, that it is for this cause, that ye might bethink you of your\nfellowship with the men of Essex.\"\n\nHis last word let loose the shout that had been long on all men's lips,\nand great and fierce it was as it rang shattering through the quiet\nupland village.  But John Ball held up his hand, and the shout was one\nand no more.\n\nThen he spoke again:\n\n\"Men of Kent, I wot well that ye are not so hard bested as those of\nother shires, by the token of the day when behind the screen of leafy\nboughs ye met Duke William with bill and bow as he wended Londonward\nfrom that woeful field of Senlac; but I have told of fellowship, and ye\nhave hearkened and understood what the Holy Church is, whereby ye know\nthat ye are fellows of the saints in heaven and the poor men of Essex;\nand as one day the saints shall call you to the heavenly feast, so now\ndo the poor men call you to the battle.\n\n\"Men of Kent, ye dwell fairly here, and your houses are framed of stout\noak beams, and your own lands ye till; unless some accursed lawyer with\nhis false lying sheepskin and forged custom of the Devil's Manor hath\nstolen it from you; but in Essex slaves they be and villeins, and worse\nthey shall be, and the lords swear that ere a year be over ox and horse\nshall go free in Essex, and man and woman shall draw the team and the\nplough; and north away in the east countries dwell men in poor halls of\nwattled reeds and mud, and the north-east wind from off the fen\nwhistles through them; and poor they be to the letter; and there him\nwhom the lord spareth, the bailiff squeezeth, and him whom the bailiff\nforgetteth, the Easterling Chapman sheareth; yet be these stout men and\nvaliant, and your very brethren.\n\n\"And yet if there be any man here so base as to think that a small\nmatter, let him look to it that if these necks abide under the yoke,\nKent shall sweat for it ere it be long; and ye shall lose acre and\nclose and woodland, and be servants in your own houses, and your sons\nshall be the lords' lads, and your daughters their lemans, and ye shall\nbuy a bold word with many stripes, and an honest deed with a leap from\nthe gallows-tree.\n\n\"Bethink ye, too, that ye have no longer to deal with Duke William,\nwho, if he were a thief and a cruel lord, was yet a prudent man and a\nwise warrior; but cruel are these, and headstrong, yea, thieves and\nfools in one--and ye shall lay their heads in the dust.\"\n\nA shout would have arisen again, but his eager voice rising higher yet,\nrestrained it as he said:\n\n\"And how shall it be then when these are gone?  What else shall ye lack\nwhen ye lack masters?  Ye shall not lack for the fields ye have tilled,\nnor the houses ye have built, nor the cloth ye have woven; all these\nshall be yours, and whatso ye will of all that the earth beareth; then\nshall no man mow the deep grass for another, while his own kine lack\ncow-meat; and he that soweth shall reap, and the reaper shall eat in\nfellowship the harvest that in fellowship he hath won; and he that\nbuildeth a house shall dwell in it with those that he biddeth of his\nfree will; and the tithe barn shall garner the wheat for all men to eat\nof when the seasons are untoward, and the rain-drift hideth the sheaves\nin August; and all shall be without money and without price.\nFaithfully and merrily then shall all men keep the holidays of the\nChurch in peace of body and joy of heart.  And man shall help man, and\nthe saints in heaven shall be glad, because men no more fear each\nother; and the churl shall be ashamed, and shall hide his churlishness\ntill it be gone, and he be no more a churl; and fellowship shall be\nestablished in heaven and on the earth.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHEY HEAR TIDINGS OF BATTLE AND MAKE THEM READY\n\nHe left off as one who had yet something else to say; and, indeed, I\nthought he would give us some word as to the trysting-place, and\nwhither the army was to go from it; because it was now clear to me that\nthis gathering was but a band of an army.  But much happened before\nJohn Ball spoke again from the cross, and it was on this wise.\n\nWhen there was silence after the last shout that the crowd had raised a\nwhile ago, I thought I heard a thin sharp noise far away, somewhat to\nthe north of the cross, which I took rather for the sound of a trumpet\nor horn, than for the voice of a man or any beast.  Will Green also\nseemed to have heard it, for he turned his head sharply and then back\nagain, and looked keenly into the crowd as though seeking to catch some\none's eye. There was a very tall man standing by the prisoner on the\nhorse near the outskirts of the crowd, and holding his bridle.  This\nman, who was well-armed, I saw look up and say something to the\nprisoner, who stooped down and seemed to whisper him in turn.  The tall\nman nodded his head and the prisoner got off his horse, which was a\ncleaner-limbed, better-built beast than the others belonging to the\nband, and the tall man quietly led him a little way from the crowd,\nmounted him, and rode off northward at a smart pace.\n\nWill Green looked on sharply at all this, and when the man rode off,\nsmiled as one who is content, and deems that all is going well, and\nsettled himself down again to listen to the priest.\n\nBut now when John Ball had ceased speaking, and after another shout,\nand a hum of excited pleasure and hope that followed it, there was\nsilence again, and as the priest addressed himself to speaking once\nmore, he paused and turned his head towards the wind, as if he heard\nsomething, which certainly I heard, and belike every one in the throng,\nthough it was not over-loud, far as sounds carry in clear quiet\nevenings.  It was the thump-a-thump of a horse drawing near at a\nhand-gallop along the grassy upland road; and I knew well it was the\ntall man coming back with tidings, the purport of which I could well\nguess.\n\nI looked up at Will Green's face.  He was smiling as one pleased, and\nsaid softly as he nodded to me, \"Yea, shall we see the grey-goose fly\nthis eve?\"\n\nBut John Ball said in a great voice from the cross, \"Hear ye the\ntidings on the way, fellows!  Hold ye together and look to your gear;\nyet hurry not, for no great matter shall this be.  I wot well there is\nlittle force between Canterbury and Kingston, for the lords are looking\nnorth of Thames toward Wat Tyler and his men.  Yet well it is, well it\nis!\"\n\nThe crowd opened and spread out a little, and the men moved about in\nit, some tightening a girdle, some getting their side arms more within\nreach of their right hands, and those who had bows stringing them.\n\nWill Green set hand and foot to the great shapely piece of polished red\nyew, with its shining horn tips, which he carried, and bent it with no\nseeming effort; then he reached out his hand over his shoulder and drew\nout a long arrow, smooth, white, beautifully balanced, with a barbed\niron head at one end, a horn nock and three strong goose feathers at\nthe other.  He held it loosely between the finger and thumb of his\nright hand, and there he stood with a thoughtful look on his face, and\nin his hands one of the most terrible weapons which a strong man has\never carried, the English long-bow and cloth-yard shaft.\n\nBut all this while the sound of the horse's hoofs was growing nearer,\nand presently from the corner of the road amidst the orchards broke out\nour long friend, his face red in the sun near sinking now.  He waved\nhis right hand as he came in sight of us, and sang out, \"Bills and\nbows! bills and bows!\" and the whole throng turned towards him and\nraised a great shout.\n\nHe reined up at the edge of the throng, and spoke in a loud voice, so\nthat all might hear him:\n\n\"Fellows, these are the tidings; even while our priest was speaking we\nheard a horn blow far off; so I bade the sergeant we have taken, and\nwho is now our fellow-in-arms, to tell me where away it was that there\nwould be folk a-gathering, and what they were; and he did me to wit\nthat mayhappen Sir John Newton was stirring from Rochester Castle; or,\nmaybe, it was the sheriff and Rafe Hopton with him; so I rode off what\nI might towards Hartlip, and I rode warily, and that was well, for as I\ncame through a little wood between Hartlip and Guildstead, I saw beyond\nit a gleam of steel, and lo in the field there a company, and a pennon\nof Rafe Hopton's arms, and that is blue and thereon three silver fish:\nand a pennon of the sheriff's arms, and that is a green tree; and\nwithal another pennon of three red kine, and whose they be I know\nnot.\"[1]\n\n\"There tied I my horse in the middle of the wood, and myself I crept\nalong the dyke to see more and to hear somewhat; and no talk I heard to\ntell of save at whiles a big knight talking to five or six others, and\nsaying somewhat, wherein came the words London and Nicholas Bramber,\nand King Richard; but I saw that of men-at-arms and sergeants there\nmight be a hundred, and of bows not many, but of those outland\narbalests maybe a fifty; and so, what with one and another of servants\nand tipstaves and lads, some three hundred, well armed, and the\nmen-at-arms of the best. Forsooth, my masters, there had I been but a\nminute, ere the big knight broke off his talk, and cried out to the\nmusic to blow up, 'And let us go look on these villeins,' said he; and\nwithal the men began to gather in a due and ordered company, and their\nfaces turned hitherward; forsooth, I got to my horse, and led him out\nof the wood on the other side, and so to saddle and away along the\ngreen roads; neither was I seen or chased.  So look ye to it, my\nmasters, for these men will be coming to speak with us; nor is there\nneed for haste, but rather for good speed; for in some twenty or thirty\nminutes will be more tidings to hand.\"\n\nBy this time one of our best-armed men had got through the throng and\nwas standing on the cross beside John Ball.  When the long man had\ndone, there was confused noise of talk for a while, and the throng\nspread itself out more and more, but not in a disorderly manner; the\nbowmen drawing together toward the outside, and the billmen forming\nbehind them.  Will Green was still standing beside me and had hold of\nmy arm, as though he knew both where he and I were to go.\n\n\"Fellows,\" quoth the captain from the cross, \"belike this stour shall\nnot live to be older than the day, if ye get not into a plump together\nfor their arbalestiers to shoot bolts into, and their men-at-arms to\nthrust spears into.  Get you to the edge of the crofts and spread out\nthere six feet between man and man, and shoot, ye bowmen, from the\nhedges, and ye with the staves keep your heads below the level of the\nhedges, or else for all they be thick a bolt may win its way in.\"\n\nHe grinned as he said this, and there was laughter enough in the throng\nto have done honour to a better joke.\n\nThen he sung out, \"Hob Wright, Rafe Wood, John Pargetter, and thou Will\nGreen, bestir ye and marshal the bowshot; and thou Nicholas Woodyer\nshall be under me Jack Straw in ordering of the staves.  Gregory Tailor\nand John Clerk, fair and fine are ye clad in the arms of the Canterbury\nbailiffs; ye shall shine from afar; go ye with the banner into the\nhighway, and the bows on either side shall ward you; yet jump, lads,\nand over the hedge with you when the bolts begin to fly your way!  Take\nheed, good fellows all, that our business is to bestride the highway,\nand not let them get in on our flank the while; so half to the right,\nhalf to the left of the highway.  Shoot straight and strong, and waste\nno breath with noise; let the loose of the bowstring cry for you! and\nlook you! think it no loss of manhood to cover your bodies with tree\nand bush; for one of us who know is worth a hundred of those proud\nfools.  To it, lads, and let them see what the grey goose bears between\nhis wings!  Abide us here, brother John Ball, and pray for us if thou\nwilt; but for me, if God will not do for Jack Straw what Jack Straw\nwould do for God were he in like case, I can see no help for it.\"\n\n\"Yea, forsooth,\" said the priest, \"here will I abide you my fellows if\nye come back; or if ye come not back, here will I abide the foe.\nDepart, and the blessing of the Fellowship be with you.\"\n\nDown then leapt Jack Straw from the cross, and the whole throng set off\nwithout noise or hurry, soberly and steadily in outward seeming.  Will\nGreen led me by the hand as if I were a boy, yet nothing he said, being\nforsooth intent on his charge.  We were some four hundred men in all;\nbut I said to myself that without some advantage of the ground we were\nlost men before the men-at-arms that long Gregory Tailor had told us\nof; for I had not seen as yet the yard-long shaft at its work.\n\nWe and somewhat more than half of our band turned into the orchards on\nthe left of the road, through which the level rays of the low sun shone\nbrightly.  The others took up their position on the right side of it.\nWe kept pretty near to the road till we had got through all the closes\nsave the last, where we were brought up by a hedge and a dyke, beyond\nwhich lay a wide-open nearly treeless space, not of tillage, as at the\nother side of the place, but of pasture, the common grazing ground of\nthe township.  A little stream wound about through the ground, with a\nfew willows here and there; there was only a thread of water in it in\nthis hot summer tide, but its course could easily be traced by the deep\nblue-green of the rushes that grew plenteously in the bed.  Geese were\nlazily wandering about and near this brook, and a herd of cows,\naccompanied by the town bull, were feeding on quietly, their heads all\nturned one way; while half a dozen calves marched close together side\nby side like a plump of soldiers, their tails swinging in a kind of\nmeasure to keep off the flies, of which there was great plenty.  Three\nor four lads and girls were sauntering about, heeding or not heeding\nthe cattle.  They looked up toward us as we crowded into the last\nclose, and slowly loitered off toward the village.  Nothing looked like\nbattle; yet battle sounded in the air; for now we heard the beat of the\nhorse-hoofs of the men-at-arms coming on towards us like the rolling of\ndistant thunder, and growing louder and louder every minute; we were\nnone too soon in turning to face them.  Jack Straw was on our side of\nthe road, and with a few gestures and a word or two he got his men into\ntheir places. Six archers lined the hedge along the road where the\nbanner of Adam and Eve, rising above the grey leaves of the\napple-trees, challenged the new-comers; and of the billmen also he kept\na good few ready to guard the road in case the enemy should try to rush\nit with the horsemen.  The road, not being a Roman one, was, you must\nremember, little like the firm smooth country roads that you are used\nto; it was a mere track between the hedges and fields, partly\ngrass-grown, and cut up by the deep-sunk ruts hardened by the drought\nof summer.  There was a stack of fagot and small wood on the other\nside, and our men threw themselves upon it and set to work to stake the\nroad across for a rough defence against the horsemen.\n\nWhat befell more on the road itself I had not much time to note, for\nour bowmen spread themselves out along the hedge that looked into the\npasture-field, leaving some six feet between man and man; the rest of\nthe billmen went along with the bowmen, and halted in clumps of some\nhalf-dozen along their line, holding themselves ready to help the\nbowmen if the enemy should run up under their shafts, or to run on to\nlengthen the line in case they should try to break in on our flank.\nThe hedge in front of us was of quick.  It had been strongly plashed in\nthe past February, and was stiff and stout.  It stood on a low bank;\nmoreover, the level of the orchard was some thirty inches higher than\nthat of the field and the ditch some two foot deeper than the face of\nthe field.  The field went winding round to beyond the church, making a\nquarter of a circle about the village, and at the western end of it\nwere the butts whence the folk were coming from shooting when I first\ncame into the village street.\n\nAltogether, to me who knew nothing of war the place seemed defensible\nenough.  I have said that the road down which Long Gregory came with\nhis tidings went north; and that was its general direction; but its\nfirst reach was nearly east, so that the low sun was not in the eyes of\nany of us, and where Will Green took his stand, and I with him, it was\nnearly at our backs.\n\n\n\n[1] Probably one of the Calverlys, a Cheshire family, one of whom was a\nnoted captain in the French wars.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE BATTLE AT THE TOWNSHIP'S END\n\nOur men had got into their places leisurely and coolly enough, and with\nno lack of jesting and laughter.  As we went along the hedge by the\nroad, the leaders tore off leafy twigs from the low oak bushes therein,\nand set them for a rallying sign in their hats and headpieces, and two\nor three of them had horns for blowing.\n\nWill Green, when he got into his place, which was thirty yards from\nwhere Jack Straw and the billmen stood in the corner of the two hedges,\nthe road hedge and the hedge between the close and field, looked to\nright and left of him a moment, then turned to the man on the left and\nsaid:\n\n\"Look you, mate, when you hear our horns blow ask no more questions,\nbut shoot straight and strong at whatso cometh towards us, till ye hear\nmore tidings from Jack Straw or from me.  Pass that word onward.\"\n\nThen he looked at me and said:\n\n\"Now, lad from Essex, thou hadst best sit down out of the way at once:\nforsooth I wot not why I brought thee hither.  Wilt thou not back to\nthe cross, for thou art little of a fighting-man?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said I, \"I would see the play.  What shall come of it?\"\n\n\"Little,\" said he; \"we shall slay a horse or twain maybe.  I will tell\nthee, since thou hast not seen a fight belike, as I have seen some,\nthat these men-at-arms cannot run fast either to the play or from it,\nif they be a-foot; and if they come on a-horseback, what shall hinder\nme to put a shaft into the poor beast?  But down with thee on the\ndaisies, for some shot there will be first.\"\n\nAs he spoke he was pulling off his belts and other gear, and his coat,\nwhich done, he laid his quiver on the ground, girt him again, did his\naxe and buckler on to his girdle, and hung up his other attire on the\nnearest tree behind us.  Then he opened his quiver and took out of it\nsome two dozen of arrows, which he stuck in the ground beside him ready\nto his hand.  Most of the bowmen within sight were doing the like.\n\nAs I glanced toward the houses I saw three or four bright figures\nmoving through the orchards, and presently noted that they were women,\nall clad more or less like the girl in the Rose, except that two of\nthem wore white coifs on their heads.  Their errand there was clear,\nfor each carried a bundle of arrows under her arm.\n\nOne of them came straight up to Will Green, and I could see at once\nthat she was his daughter.  She was tall and strongly made, with black\nhair like her father, somewhat comely, though no great beauty; but as\nthey met, her eyes smiled even more than her mouth, and made her face\nlook very sweet and kind, and the smile was answered back in a way so\nquaintly like to her father's face, that I too smiled for goodwill and\npleasure.\n\n\"Well, well, lass,\" said he, \"dost thou think that here is Crecy field\ntoward, that ye bring all this artillery?  Turn back, my girl, and set\nthe pot on the fire; for that shall we need when we come home, I and\nthis ballad-maker here.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" she said, nodding kindly at me, \"if this is to be no Crecy, then\nmay I stop to see, as well as the ballad-maker, since he hath neither\nsword nor staff?\"\n\n\"Sweetling,\" he said, \"get thee home in haste.  This play is but\nlittle, yet mightest thou be hurt in it; and trust me the time may\ncome, sweetheart, when even thou and such as thou shalt hold a sword or\na staff.  Ere the moon throws a shadow we shall be back.\"\n\nShe turned away lingering, not without tears on her face, laid the\nsheaf of arrows at the foot of the tree, and hastened off through the\norchard.  I was going to say something, when Will Green held up his\nhand as who would bid us hearken.  The noise of the horse-hoofs, after\ngrowing nearer and nearer, had ceased suddenly, and a confused murmur\nof voices had taken the place of it.\n\n\"Get thee down, and take cover, old lad,\" said Will Green; \"the dance\nwill soon begin, and ye shall hear the music presently.\"\n\nSure enough as I slipped down by the hedge close to which I had been\nstanding, I heard the harsh twang of the bow-strings, one, two, three,\nalmost together, from the road, and even the whew of the shafts, though\nthat was drowned in a moment by a confused but loud and threatening\nshout from the other side, and again the bowstrings clanged, and this\ntime a far-off clash of arms followed, and therewithal that cry of a\nstrong man that comes without his will, and is so different from his\nwonted voice that one has a guess thereby of the change that death is.\nThen for a while was almost silence; nor did our horns blow up, though\nsome half-dozen of the billmen had leapt into the road when the bows\nfirst shot.  But presently came a great blare of trumpets and horns\nfrom the other side, and therewith as it were a river of steel and\nbright coats poured into the field before us, and still their horns\nblew as they spread out toward the left of our line; the cattle in the\npasture-field, heretofore feeding quietly, seemed frightened silly by\nthe sudden noise, and ran about tail in air and lowing loudly; the old\nbull with his head a little lowered, and his stubborn legs planted\nfirmly, growling threateningly; while the geese about the brook waddled\naway gobbling and squeaking; all which seemed so strange to us along\nwith the threat of sudden death that rang out from the bright array\nover against us, that we laughed outright, the most of us, and Will\nGreen put down his head in mockery of the bull and grunted like him,\nwhereat we laughed yet more.  He turned round to me as he nocked his\narrow, and said:\n\n\"I would they were just fifty paces nigher, and they move not. Ho!\nJack Straw, shall we shoot?\"\n\nFor the latter-named was nigh us now; he shook his head and said\nnothing as he stood looking at the enemy's line.\n\n\"Fear not but they are the right folk, Jack,\" quoth Will Green.\n\n\"Yea, yea,\" said he, \"but abide awhile; they could make nought of the\nhighway, and two of their sergeants had a message from the grey-goose\nfeather.  Abide, for they have not crossed the road to our right hand,\nand belike have not seen our fellows on the other side, who are now for\na bushment to them.\"\n\nI looked hard at the man.  He was a tall, wiry, and broad-shouldered\nfellow, clad in a handsome armour of bright steel that certainly had\nnot been made for a yeoman, but over it he had a common linen\nsmock-frock or gabardine, like our field workmen wear now or used to\nwear, and in his helmet he carried instead of a feather a wisp of\nwheaten straw.  He bore a heavy axe in his hand besides the sword he\nwas girt with, and round his neck hung a great horn for blowing.  I\nshould say that I knew that there were at least three \"Jack Straws\"\namong the fellowship of the discontented, one of whom was over in Essex.\n\nAs we waited there, every bowman with his shaft nocked on the string,\nthere was a movement in the line opposite, and presently came from it a\nlittle knot of three men, the middle one on horseback, the other two\narmed with long-handled glaives; all three well muffled up in armour.\nAs they came nearer I could see that the horseman had a tabard over his\narmour, gaily embroidered with a green tree on a gold ground, and in\nhis hand a trumpet.\n\n\"They are come to summon us.  Wilt thou that he speak, Jack?\" said Will\nGreen.\n\n\"Nay,\" said the other; \"yet shall he have warning first.  Shoot when my\nhorn blows!\"\n\nAnd therewith he came up to the hedge, climbed over, slowly because of\nhis armour, and stood some dozen yards out in the field.  The man on\nhorseback put his trumpet to his mouth and blew a long blast, and then\ntook a scroll into his hand and made as if he were going to read; but\nJack Straw lifted up his voice and cried out:\n\n\"Do it not, or thou art but dead!  We will have no accursed lawyers and\ntheir sheep-skins here!  Go back to those that sent thee----\"\n\nBut the man broke in in a loud harsh voice:\n\n\"Ho!  YE PEOPLE! what will ye gathering in arms?\"\n\nThen cried Jack Straw:\n\n\"Sir Fool, hold your peace till ye have heard me, or else we shoot at\nonce.  Go back to those that sent thee, and tell them that we free men\nof Kent are on the way to London to speak with King Richard, and to\ntell him that which he wots not; to wit, that there is a certain sort\nof fools and traitors to the realm who would put collars on our necks\nand make beasts of us, and that it is his right and his devoir to do as\nhe swore when he was crowned and anointed at Westminster on the Stone\nof Doom, and gainsay these thieves and traitors; and if he be too weak,\nthen shall we help him; and if he will not be king, then shall we have\none who will be, and that is the King's Son of Heaven.  Now, therefore,\nif any withstand us on our lawful errand as we go to speak with our own\nking and lord, let him look to it.  Bear back this word to them that\nsent thee.  But for thee, hearken, thou bastard of an inky sheep-skin!\nget thee gone and tarry not; three times shall I lift up my hand, and\nthe third time look to thyself, for then shalt thou hear the loose of\nour bowstrings, and after that nought else till thou hearest the devil\nbidding thee welcome to hell!\"\n\nOur fellows shouted, but the summoner began again, yet in a quavering\nvoice:\n\n\"Ho!  YE PEOPLE! what will ye gathering in arms?  Wot ye not that ye\nare doing or shall do great harm, loss, and hurt to the king's\nlieges----\"\n\nHe stopped; Jack Straw's hand was lowered for the second time. He\nlooked to his men right and left, and then turned rein and turned tail,\nand scuttled back to the main body at his swiftest. Huge laughter\nrattled out all along our line as Jack Straw climbed back into the\norchard grinning also.\n\nThen we noted more movement in the enemy's line.  They were spreading\nthe archers and arbalestiers to our left, and the men-at-arms and\nothers also spread some, what under the three pennons of which Long\nGregory had told us, and which were plain enough to us in the dear\nevening.  Presently the moving line faced us, and the archers set off\nat a smart pace toward us, the men-at-arms holding back a little behind\nthem.  I knew now that they had been within bowshot all along, but our\nmen were loth to shoot before their first shots would tell, like those\nhalf-dozen in the road when, as they told me afterwards, a plump of\ntheir men-at-arms had made a show of falling on.\n\nBut now as soon as those men began to move on us directly in face, Jack\nStraw put his horn to his lips and blew a loud rough blast that was\nechoed by five or six others along the orchard hedge.  Every man had\nhis shaft nocked on the string; I watched them, and Will Green\nspecially; he and his bow and its string seemed all of a piece, so\neasily by seeming did he draw the nock of the arrow to his ear.  A\nmoment, as he took his aim, and then--O then did I understand the\nmeaning of the awe with which the ancient poet speaks of the loose of\nthe god Apollo's bow; for terrible indeed was the mingled sound of the\ntwanging bowstring and the whirring shaft so close to me.\n\nI was now on my knees right in front of Will and saw all clearly; the\narbalestiers (for no long-bow men were over against our stead) had all\nof them bright headpieces, and stout body-armour of boiled leather with\nmetal studs, and as they came towards us, I could see over their\nshoulders great wooden shields hanging at their backs.  Further to our\nleft their long-bow men had shot almost as soon as ours, and I heard or\nseemed to hear the rush of the arrows through the apple-boughs and a\nman's cry therewith; but with us the long-bow had been before the\ncross-bow; one of the arbalestiers fell outright, his great shield\nclattering down on him, and moved no more; while three others were hit\nand were crawling to the rear.  The rest had shouldered their bows and\nwere aiming, but I thought unsteadily; and before the triggers were\ndrawn again Will Green had nocked and loosed, and not a few others of\nour folk; then came the wooden hail of the bolts rattling through the\nboughs, but all overhead and no one hit.\n\nThe next time Will Green nocked his arrow he drew with a great shout,\nwhich all our fellows took up; for the arbalestiers instead of turning\nabout in their places covered by their great shields and winding up\ntheir cross-bows for a second shot, as is the custom of such soldiers,\nran huddling together toward their men-at-arms, our arrows driving\nthump-thump into their shields as they ran: I saw four lying on the\nfield dead or sore wounded.\n\nBut our archers shouted again, and kept on each plucking the arrows\nfrom the ground, and nocking and loosing swiftly but deliberately at\nthe line before them; indeed now was the time for these terrible\nbowmen, for as Will Green told me afterwards they always reckoned to\nkill through cloth or leather at five hundred yards, and they had let\nthe cross-bow men come nearly within three hundred, and these were now\nall mingled and muddled up with the men-at-arms at scant five hundred\nyards' distance; and belike, too, the latter were not treating them too\nwell, but seemed to be belabouring them with their spear-staves in\ntheir anger at the poorness of the play; so that as Will Green said it\nwas like shooting at hay-ricks.\n\nAll this you must understand lasted but a few minutes, and when our men\nhad been shooting quite coolly, like good workmen at peaceful work, for\na few minutes more, the enemy's line seemed to clear somewhat; the\npennon with the three red kine showed in front and three men armed from\nhead to foot in gleaming steel, except for their short coats bright\nwith heraldry, were with it. One of them (and he bore the three kine on\nhis coat) turned round and gave some word of command, and an angry\nshout went up from them, and they came on steadily towards us, the man\nwith the red kine on his coat leading them, a great naked sword in his\nhand: you must note that they were all on foot; but as they drew nearer\nI saw their horses led by grooms and pages coming on slowly behind them.\n\nSooth said Will Green that the men-at-arms run not fast either to or\nfro the fray; they came on no faster than a hasty walk, their arms\nclashing about them and the twang of the bows and whistle of the arrows\nnever failing all the while, but going on like the push of the westerly\ngale, as from time to time the men-at-arms shouted, \"Ha! ha!  out! out!\nKentish thieves!\"\n\nBut when they began to fall on, Jack Straw shouted out, \"Bills to the\nfield! bills to the field!\"\n\nThen all our billmen ran up and leapt over the hedge into the meadow\nand stood stoutly along the ditch under our bows, Jack Straw in the\nforefront handling his great axe.  Then he cast it into his left hand,\ncaught up his horn and winded it loudly.  The men-at-arms drew near\nsteadily, some fell under the arrow-storm, but not a many; for though\nthe target was big, it was hard, since not even the cloth-yard shaft\ncould pierce well-wrought armour of plate, and there was much armour\namong them.  Withal the arbalestiers were shooting again, but high and\nat a venture, so they did us no hurt.\n\nBut as these soldiers made wise by the French war were now drawing\nnear, and our bowmen were casting down their bows and drawing their\nshort swords, or handling their axes, as did Will Green, muttering,\n\"Now must Hob Wright's gear end this play\"--while this was a-doing, lo,\non a sudden a flight of arrows from our right on the flank of the\nsergeants' array, which stayed them somewhat; not because it slew many\nmen, but because they began to bethink them that their foes were many\nand all around them; then the road-hedge on the right seemed alive with\narmed men, for whatever could hold sword or staff amongst us was there;\nevery bowman also leapt our orchard-hedge sword or axe in hand, and\nwith a great shout, billmen, archers, and all, ran in on them;\nhalf-armed, yea, and half-naked some of them; strong and stout and\nlithe and light withal, the wrath of battle and the hope of better\ntimes lifting up their hearts till nothing could withstand them.  So\nwas all mingled together, and for a minute or two was a confused\nclamour over which rose a clatter like the riveting of iron plates, or\nthe noise of the street of coppersmiths at Florence; then the throng\nburst open and the steel-clad sergeants and squires and knights ran\nhuddling and shuffling towards their horses; but some cast down their\nweapons and threw up their hands and cried for peace and ransom; and\nsome stood and fought desperately, and slew some till they were\nhammered down by many strokes, and of these were the bailiffs and\ntipstaves, and the lawyers and their men, who could not run and hoped\nfor no mercy.\n\nI looked as on a picture and wondered, and my mind was at strain to\nremember something forgotten, which yet had left its mark on it.  I\nheard the noise of the horse-hoofs of the fleeing men-at-arms (the\narchers and arbalestiers had scattered before the last minutes of the\nplay), I heard the confused sound of laughter and rejoicing down in the\nmeadow, and close by me the evening wind lifting the lighter twigs of\nthe trees, and far away the many noises of the quiet country, till\nlight and sound both began to fade from me and I saw and heard nothing.\n\nI leapt up to my feet presently and there was Will Green before me as I\nhad first seen him in the street with coat and hood and the gear at his\ngirdle and his unstrung bow in his hand; his face smiling and kind\nagain, but maybe a thought sad.\n\n\"Well,\" quoth I, \"what is the tale for the ballad-maker?\"\n\n\"As Jack Straw said it would be,\" said he, \"'the end of the day and the\nend of the fray;'\" and he pointed to the brave show of the sky over the\nsunken sun; \"the knights fled and the sheriff dead: two of the lawyer\nkind slain afield, and one hanged: and cruel was he to make them cruel:\nand three bailiffs knocked on the head--stout men, and so witless, that\nnone found their brains in their skulls; and five arbalestiers and one\narcher slain, and a score and a half of others, mostly men come back\nfrom the French wars, men of the Companions there, knowing no other\ncraft than fighting for gold; and this is the end they are paid for.\nWell, brother, saving the lawyers who belike had no souls, but only\nparchment deeds and libels of the same, God rest their souls!\"\n\nHe fell a-musing; but I said, \"And of our Fellowship were any slain?\"\n\n\"Two good men of the township,\" he said, \"Hob Horner and Antony Webber,\nwere slain outright, Hob with a shaft and Antony in the hand-play, and\nJohn Pargetter hurt very sore on the shoulder with a glaive; and five\nmore men of the Fellowship slain in the hand-play, and some few hurt,\nbut not sorely.  And as to those slain, if God give their souls rest it\nis well; for little rest they had on the earth belike; but for me, I\ndesire rest no more.\"\n\nI looked at him and our eyes met with no little love; and I wondered to\nsee how wrath and grief within him were contending with the kindness of\nthe man, and how clear the tokens of it were in his face.\n\n\"Come now, old lad,\" said he, \"for I deem that John Ball and Jack Straw\nhave a word to say to us at the cross yet, since these men broke off\nthe telling of the tale; there shall we know what we are to take in\nhand to-morrow.  And afterwards thou shalt eat and drink in my house\nthis once, if never again.\"\n\nSo we went through the orchard closes again; and others were about and\nanigh us, all turned towards the cross as we went over the dewy grass,\nwhereon the moon was just beginning to throw shadows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nMORE WORDS AT THE CROSS\n\nI got into my old place again on the steps of the cross, Will Green\nbeside me, and above me John Ball and Jack Straw again. The moon was\nhalf-way up the heavens now, and the short summer night had begun, calm\nand fragrant, with just so much noise outside our quiet circle as made\none feel the world alive and happy.\n\nWe waited silently until we had heard John Ball and the story of what\nwas to do; and presently he began to speak.\n\n\"Good people, it is begun, but not ended.  Which of you is hardy enough\nto wend the road to London to-morrow?\"\n\n\"All!  All!\" they shouted.\n\n\"Yea,\" said he, \"even so I deemed of you.  Yet forsooth hearken!\nLondon is a great and grievous city; and mayhappen when ye come thither\nit shall seem to you overgreat to deal with, when ye remember the\nlittle townships and the cots ye came from.\n\n\"Moreover, when ye dwell here in Kent ye think forsooth of your\nbrethren in Essex or Suffolk, and there belike an end.  But from London\nye may have an inkling of all the world, and over-burdensome maybe\nshall that seem to you, a few and a feeble people.\n\n\"Nevertheless I say to you, remember the Fellowship, in the hope of\nwhich ye have this day conquered; and when ye come to London be wise\nand wary; and that is as much as to say, be bold and hardy; for in\nthese days are ye building a house which shall not be overthrown, and\nthe world shall not be too great or too little to hold it: for indeed\nit shall be the world itself, set free from evil-doers for friends to\ndwell in.\"\n\nHe ceased awhile, but they hearkened still, as if something more was\ncoming.  Then he said:\n\n\"To-morrow we shall take the road for Rochester; and most like it were\nwell to see what Sir John Newton in the castle may say to us: for the\nman is no ill man, and hath a tongue well-shapen for words; and it were\nwell that we had him out of the castle and away with us, and that we\nput a word in his mouth to say to the King.  And wot ye well, good\nfellows, that by then we come to Rochester we shall be a goodly\ncompany, and ere we come to Blackheath a very great company; and at\nLondon Bridge who shall stay our host?\n\n\"Therefore there is nought that can undo us except our own selves and\nour hearkening to soft words from those who would slay us. They shall\nbid us go home and abide peacefully with our wives and children while\nthey, the lords and councillors and lawyers, imagine counsel and remedy\nfor us; and even so shall our own folly bid us; and if we hearken\nthereto we are undone indeed; for they shall fall upon our peace with\nwar, and our wives and children they shall take from us, and some of us\nthey shall hang, and some they shall scourge, and the others shall be\ntheir yoke-beasts--yea, and worse, for they shall lack meat more.\n\n\"To fools hearken not, whether they be yourselves or your foemen, for\neither shall lead you astray.\n\n\"With the lords parley not, for ye know already what they would say to\nyou, and that is, 'Churl, let me bridle thee and saddle thee, and eat\nthy livelihood that thou winnest, and call thee hard names because I\neat thee up; and for thee, speak not and do not, save as I bid thee.'\n\n\"All that is the end of their parleying.\n\n\"Therefore be ye bold, and again bold, and thrice bold!  Grip the bow,\nhandle the staff, draw the sword, and set on in the name of the\nFellowship!\"\n\nHe ended amid loud shouts; but straight-way answering shouts were\nheard, and a great noise of the winding of horns, and I misdoubted a\nnew onslaught; and some of those in the throng began to string their\nbows and handle their bills; but Will Green pulled me by the sleeve and\nsaid:\n\n\"Friends are these by the winding of their horns; thou art quit for\nthis night, old lad.\"  And then Jack Straw cried out from the cross:\n\"Fair and softly, my masters!  These be men of our Fellowship, and are\nfor your guests this night; they are from the bents this side of\nMedway, and are with us here because of the pilgrimage road, and that\nis the best in these parts, and so the shortest to Rochester.  And\ndoubt ye nothing of our being taken unawares this night; for I have\nbidden and sent out watchers of the ways, and neither a man's son nor a\nmare's son may come in on us without espial.  Now make we our friends\nwelcome.  Forsooth, I looked for them an hour later; and had they come\nan hour earlier yet, some heads would now lie on the cold grass which\nshall lie on a feather bed to-night.  But let be, since all is well!\n\n\"Now get we home to our houses, and eat and drink and slumber this\nnight, if never once again, amid the multitude of friends and fellows;\nand yet soberly and without riot, since so much work is to hand.\nMoreover the priest saith, bear ye the dead men, both friends and foes,\ninto the chancel of the church, and there this night he will wake them:\nbut after to-morrow let the dead abide to bury their dead!\"\n\nTherewith he leapt down from the cross, and Will and I bestirred\nourselves and mingled with the new-comers.  They were some three\nhundred strong, clad and armed in all ways like the people of our\ntownship, except some half-dozen whose armour shone cold like ice under\nthe moonbeams.  Will Green soon had a dozen of them by the sleeve to\ncome home with him to board and bed, and then I lost him for some\nminutes, and turning about saw John Ball standing behind me, looking\npensively on all the stir and merry humours of the joyous uplanders.\n\n\"Brother from Essex,\" said he, \"shall I see thee again to-night? I were\nfain of speech with thee; for thou seemest like one that has seen more\nthan most.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said I, \"if ye come to Will Green's house, for thither am I\nbidden.\"\n\n\"Thither shall I come,\" said he, smiling kindly, \"or no man I know in\nfield.  Lo you, Will Green looking for something, and that is me.  But\nin his house will be song and the talk of many friends; and forsooth I\nhave words in me that crave to come out in a quiet place where they may\nhave each one his own answer.  If thou art not afraid of dead men who\nwere alive and wicked this morning, come thou to the church when supper\nis done, and there we may talk all we will.\"\n\nWill Green was standing beside us before he had done, with his hand\nlaid on the priest's shoulder, waiting till he had spoken out; and as I\nnodded Yea to John Ball he said:\n\n\"Now, master priest, thou hast spoken enough this two or three hours,\nand this my new brother must tell and talk in my house; and there my\nmaid will hear his wisdom which lay still under the hedge e'en now when\nthe bolts were abroad.  So come ye, and ye good fellows, come!\"\n\nSo we turned away together into the little street.  But while John Ball\nhad been speaking to me I felt strangely, as though I had more things\nto say than the words I knew could make clear: as if I wanted to get\nfrom other people a new set of words. Moreover, as we passed up the\nstreet again I was once again smitten with the great beauty of the\nscene; the houses, the church with its new chancel and tower,\nsnow-white in the moonbeams now; the dresses and arms of the people,\nmen and women (for the latter were now mixed up with the men); their\ngrave sonorous language, and the quaint and measured forms of speech,\nwere again become a wonder to me and affected me almost to tears.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nSUPPER AT WILL GREEN'S\n\nI walked along with the others musing as if I did not belong to them,\ntill we came to Will Green's house.  He was one of the wealthier of the\nyeomen, and his house was one of those I told you of, the lower story\nof which was built of stone.  It had not been built long, and was very\ntrim and neat.  The fit of wonder had worn off me again by then I\nreached it, or perhaps I should give you a closer description of it,\nfor it was a handsome yeoman's dwelling of that day, which is as much\nas saying it was very beautiful.  The house on the other side of it,\nthe last house in the village, was old or even ancient; all built of\nstone, and except for a newer piece built on to it--a hall, it\nseemed--had round arches, some of them handsomely carved.  I knew that\nthis was the parson's house; but he was another sort of priest than\nJohn Ball, and what for fear, what for hatred, had gone back to his\nmonastery with the two other chantrey priests who dwelt in that house;\nso that the men of the township, and more especially the women, were\nthinking gladly how John Ball should say mass in their new chancel on\nthe morrow.\n\nWill Green's daughter was waiting for him at the door and gave him a\nclose and eager hug, and had a kiss to spare for each of us withal: a\nstrong girl she was, as I have said, and sweet and wholesome also.  She\nmade merry with her father; yet it was easy to see that her heart was\nin her mouth all along.  There was a younger girl some twelve summers\nold, and a lad of ten, who were easily to be known for his children; an\nold woman also, who had her livelihood there, and helped the household;\nand moreover three long young men, who came into the house after we had\nsat down, to whom Will nodded kindly.  They were brisk lads and smart,\nbut had been afield after the beasts that evening, and had not seen the\nfray.\n\nThe room we came into was indeed the house, for there was nothing but\nit on the ground floor, but a stair in the corner went up to the\nchamber or loft above.  It was much like the room at the Rose, but\nbigger; the cupboard better wrought, and with more vessels on it, and\nhandsomer.  Also the walls, instead of being panelled, were hung with a\ncoarse loosely-woven stuff of green worsted with birds and trees woven\ninto it.  There were flowers in plenty stuck about the room, mostly of\nthe yellow blossoming flag or flower-de-luce, of which I had seen\nplenty in all the ditches, but in the window near the door was a pot\nfull of those same white poppies I had seen when I first woke up; and\nthe table was all set forth with meat and drink, a big salt-cellar of\npewter in the middle, covered with a white cloth.\n\nWe sat down, the priest blessed the meat in the name of the Trinity,\nand we crossed ourselves and fell to.  The victual was plentiful of\nbroth and flesh-meat, and bread and cherries, so we ate and drank, and\ntalked lightly together when we were full.\n\nYet was not the feast so gay as might have been.  Will Green had me to\nsit next to him, and on the other side sat John Ball; but the priest\nhad grown somewhat distraught, and sat as one thinking of somewhat that\nwas like to escape his thought.  Will Green looked at his daughter from\ntime to time, and whiles his eyes glanced round the fair chamber as one\nwho loved it, and his kind face grew sad, yet never sullen.  When the\nherdsmen came into the hall they fell straightway to asking questions\nconcerning those of the Fellowship who had been slain in the fray, and\nof their wives and children; so that for a while thereafter no man\ncared to jest, for they were a neighbourly and kind folk, and were\nsorry both for the dead, and also for the living that should suffer\nfrom that day's work.\n\nSo then we sat silent awhile.  The unseen moon was bright over the roof\nof the house, so that outside all was gleaming bright save the black\nshadows, though the moon came not into the room, and the white wall of\nthe tower was the whitest and the brightest thing we could see.\n\nWide open were the windows, and the scents of the fragrant night\nfloated in upon us, and the sounds of the men at their meat or making\nmerry about the township; and whiles we heard the gibber of an owl from\nthe trees westward of the church, and the sharp cry of a blackbird made\nfearful by the prowling stoat, or the far-off lowing of a cow from the\nupland pastures; or the hoofs of a horse trotting on the pilgrimage\nroad (and one of our watchers would that be).\n\nThus we sat awhile, and once again came that feeling over me of wonder\nand pleasure at the strange and beautiful sights, mingled with the\nsights and sounds and scents beautiful indeed, yet not strange, but\nrather long familiar to me.\n\nBut now Will Green started in his seat where he sat with his daughter\nhanging over his chair, her hand amidst his thick black curls, and she\nweeping softly, I thought; and his rough strong voice broke the silence.\n\n\"Why, lads and neighbours, what ails us?  If the knights who fled from\nus this eve were to creep back hither and look in at the window, they\nwould deem that they had slain us after all, and that we were but the\nghosts of the men who fought them.  Yet, forsooth, fair it is at whiles\nto sit with friends and let the summer night speak for us and tell us\nits tales.  But now, sweetling, fetch the mazer and the wine.\"\n\n\"Forsooth,\" said John Ball, \"if ye laugh not over-much now, ye shall\nlaugh the more on the morrow of to-morrow, as ye draw nearer to the\nplay of point and edge.\"\n\n\"That is sooth,\" said one of the upland guests.  \"So it was seen in\nFrance when we fought there; and the eve of fight was sober and the\nmorn was merry.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said another, \"but there, forsooth, it was for nothing ye\nfought; and to-morrow it shall be for a fair reward.\"\n\n\"It was for life we fought,\" said the first.\n\n\"Yea,\" said the second, \"for life; and leave to go home and find the\nlawyers at their fell game.  Ho, Will Green, call a health over the\ncup!\"\n\nFor now Will Green had a bowl of wine in his hand.  He stood up and\nsaid:  \"Here, now, I call a health to the wrights of Kent who be\nturning our plough-shares into swords and our pruning-hooks into\nspears!  Drink around, my masters!\"\n\nThen he drank, and his daughter filled the bowl brimming again and he\npassed it to me.  As I took it I saw that it was of light polished wood\ncuriously speckled, with a band of silver round it, on which was cut\nthe legend, \"In the name of the Trinity fill the cup and drink to me.\"\nAnd before I drank, it came upon me to say, \"To-morrow, and the fair\ndays afterwards!\"\n\nThen I drank a great draught of the strong red wine, and passed it on;\nand every man said something over it, as \"The road to London Bridge!\"\n\"Hob Carter and his mate!\" and so on, till last of all John Ball drank,\nsaying:\n\n\"Ten years hence, and the freedom of the Fellowship!\"  Then he said to\nWill Green:  \"Now, Will, must I needs depart to go and wake the dead,\nboth friend and foe in the church yonder; and whoso of you will be\nshriven let him come to me thither in the morn, nor spare for as little\nafter sunrise as it may be.  And this our friend and brother from over\nthe water of Thames, he hath will to talk with me and I with him; so\nnow will I take him by the hand: and so God keep you, fellows!\"\n\nI rose to meet him as he came round the head of the table, and took his\nhand.  Will Green turned round to me and said:\n\n\"Thou wilt come back again timely, old lad; for betimes on the morrow\nmust we rise if we shall dine at Rochester.\"\n\nI stammered as I yea-said him; for John Ball was looking strangely at\nme with a half-smile, and my heart beat anxiously and fearfully: but we\nwent quietly to the door and so out into the bright moonlight.\n\nI lingered a little when we had passed the threshold, and looked back\nat the yellow-lighted window and the shapes of the men that I saw\ntherein with a grief and longing that I could not give myself a reason\nfor, since I was to come back so soon.  John Ball did not press me to\nmove forward, but held up his hand as if to bid me hearken.  The folk\nand guests there had already shaken themselves down since our\ndeparture, and were gotten to be reasonably merry it seemed; for one of\nthe guests, he who had spoken of France before, had fallen to singing a\nballad of the war to a wild and melancholy tune.  I remember the first\nrhymes of it, which I heard as I turned away my head and we moved on\ntoward the church:\n\n        \"On a fair field of France\n         We fought on a morning\n         So lovely as it lieth\n         Along by the water.\n         There was many a lord there\n         Mowed men in the medley,\n         'Midst the banners of the barons\n         And bold men of the knighthood,\n         And spearmen and sergeants\n         And shooters of the shaft.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nBETWIXT THE LIVING AND THE DEAD\n\nWe entered the church through the south porch under a round-arched door\ncarved very richly, and with a sculpture over the doorway and under the\narch, which, as far as I could see by the moonlight, figured St.\nMichael and the Dragon.  As I came into the rich gloom of the nave I\nnoticed for the first time that I had one of those white poppies in my\nhand; I must have taken it out of the pot by the window as I passed out\nof Will Green's house.\n\nThe nave was not very large, but it looked spacious too; it was\nsomewhat old, but well-built and handsome; the roof of curved wooden\nrafters with great tie-beams going from wall to wall. There was no\nlight in it but that of the moon streaming through the windows, which\nwere by no means large, and were glazed with white fretwork, with here\nand there a little figure in very deep rich colours.  Two larger\nwindows near the east end of each aisle had just been made so that the\nchurch grew lighter toward the east, and I could see all the work on\nthe great screen between the nave and chancel which glittered bright in\nnew paint and gilding: a candle glimmered in the loft above it, before\nthe huge rood that filled up the whole space between the loft and the\nchancel arch.  There was an altar at the east end of each aisle, the\none on the south side standing against the outside wall, the one on the\nnorth against a traceried gaily-painted screen, for that aisle ran on\nalong the chancel.  There were a few oak benches near this second\naltar, seemingly just made, and well carved and moulded; otherwise the\nfloor of the nave, which was paved with a quaint pavement of glazed\ntiles like the crocks I had seen outside as to ware, was quite clear,\nand the shafts of the arches rose out of it white and beautiful under\nthe moon as though out of a sea, dark but with gleams struck over it.\n\nThe priest let me linger and look round, when he had crossed himself\nand given me the holy water; and then I saw that the walls were figured\nall over with stories, a huge St. Christopher with his black beard\nlooking like Will Green, being close to the porch by which we entered,\nand above the chancel arch the Doom of the last Day, in which the\npainter had not spared either kings or bishops, and in which a lawyer\nwith his blue coif was one of the chief figures in the group which the\nDevil was hauling off to hell.\n\n\"Yea,\" said John Ball, \"'tis a goodly church and fair as you may see\n'twixt Canterbury and London as for its kind; and yet do I misdoubt me\nwhere those who are dead are housed, and where those shall house them\nafter they are dead, who built this house for God to dwell in.  God\ngrant they be cleansed at last; forsooth one of them who is now alive\nis a foul swine and a cruel wolf.  Art thou all so sure, scholar, that\nall such have souls? and if it be so, was it well done of God to make\nthem?  I speak to thee thus, for I think thou art no delator; and if\nthou be, why should I heed it, since I think not to come back from this\njourney.\"\n\nI looked at him and, as it were, had some ado to answer him; but I said\nat last, \"Friend, I never saw a soul, save in the body; I cannot tell.\"\n\nHe crossed himself and said, \"Yet do I intend that ere many days are\ngone by my soul shall be in bliss among the fellowship of the saints,\nand merry shall it be, even before my body rises from the dead; for\nwisely I have wrought in the world, and I wot well of friends that are\nlong ago gone from the world, as St. Martin, and St. Francis, and St.\nThomas of Canterbury, who shall speak well of me to the heavenly\nFellowship, and I shall in no wise lose my reward.\"\n\nI looked shyly at him as he spoke; his face looked sweet and calm and\nhappy, and I would have said no word to grieve him; and yet belike my\neyes looked wonder on him: he seemed to note it and his face grew\npuzzled.  \"How deemest thou of these things?\" said he: \"why do men die\nelse, if it be otherwise than this?\"\n\nI smiled:  \"Why then do they live?\" said I.\n\nEven in the white moonlight I saw his face flush, and he cried out in a\ngreat voice, \"To do great deeds or to repent them that they ever were\nborn.\" \"Yea,\" said I, \"they live to live because the world liveth.\"  He\nstretched out his hand to me and grasped mine, but said no more; and\nwent on till we came to the door in the rood-screen; then he turned to\nme with his hand on the ring-latch, and said, \"Hast thou seen many dead\nmen?\"\n\n\"Nay, but few,\" said I.\n\n\"And I a many,\" said he; \"but come now and look on these, our friends\nfirst and then our foes, so that ye may not look to see them while we\nsit and talk of the days that are to be on the earth before the Day of\nDoom cometh.\"\n\nSo he opened the door, and we went into the chancel; a light burned on\nthe high altar before the host, and looked red and strange in the\nmoonlight that came through the wide traceried windows unstained by the\npictures and beflowerings of the glazing; there were new stalls for the\npriests and vicars where we entered, carved more abundantly and\nbeautifully than any of the woodwork I had yet seen, and everywhere was\nrich and fair colour and delicate and dainty form.  Our dead lay just\nbefore the high altar on low biers, their faces all covered with linen\ncloths, for some of them had been sore smitten and hacked in the fray.\nWe went up to them and John Ball took the cloth from the face of one;\nhe had been shot to the heart with a shaft and his face was calm and\nsmooth.  He had been a young man fair and comely, with hair flaxen\nalmost to whiteness; he lay there in his clothes as he had fallen, the\nhands crossed over his breast and holding a rush cross.  His bow lay on\none side of him, his quiver of shafts and his sword on the other.\n\nJohn Ball spake to me while he held the corner of the sheet: \"What\nsayest thou, scholar? feelest thou sorrow of heart when thou lookest on\nthis, either for the man himself, or for thyself and the time when thou\nshalt be as he is?\"\n\nI said, \"Nay, I feel no sorrow for this; for the man is not here: this\nis an empty house, and the master has gone from it. Forsooth, this to\nme is but as a waxen image of a man; nay, not even that, for if it were\nan image, it would be an image of the man as he was when he was alive.\nBut here is no life nor semblance of life, and I am not moved by it;\nnay, I am more moved by the man's clothes and war-gear--there is more\nlife in them than in him.\"\n\n\"Thou sayest sooth,\" said he; \"but sorrowest thou not for thine own\ndeath when thou lookest on him?\"\n\nI said, \"And how can I sorrow for that which I cannot so much as think\nof?  Bethink thee that while I am alive I cannot think that I shall\ndie, or believe in death at all, although I know well that I shall\ndie--I can but think of myself as living in some new way.\"\n\nAgain he looked on me as if puzzled; then his face cleared as he said,\n\"Yea, forsooth, and that is what the Church meaneth by death, and even\nthat I look for; and that hereafter I shall see all the deeds that I\nhave done in the body, and what they really were, and what shall come\nof them; and ever shall I be a member of the Church, and that is the\nFellowship; then, even as now.\"\n\nI sighed as he spoke; then I said, \"Yea, somewhat in this fashion have\nmost of men thought, since no man that is can conceive of not being;\nand I mind me that in those stories of the old Danes, their common word\nfor a man dying is to say, 'He changed his life.'\"\n\n\"And so deemest thou?\"\n\nI shook my head and said nothing.\n\n\"What hast thou to say hereon?\" said he, \"for there seemeth something\nbetwixt us twain as it were a wall that parteth us.\"\n\n\"This,\" said I, \"that though I die and end, yet mankind yet liveth,\ntherefore I end not, since I am a man; and even so thou deemest, good\nfriend; or at the least even so thou doest, since now thou art ready to\ndie in grief and torment rather than be unfaithful to the Fellowship,\nyea rather than fail to work thine utmost for it; whereas, as thou\nthyself saidst at the cross, with a few words spoken and a little\nhuddling-up of the truth, with a few pennies paid, and a few masses\nsung, thou mightest have had a good place on this earth and in that\nheaven.  And as thou doest, so now doth many a poor man unnamed and\nunknown, and shall do while the world lasteth: and they that do less\nthan this, fail because of fear, and are ashamed of their cowardice,\nand make many tales to themselves to deceive themselves, lest they\nshould grow too much ashamed to live.  And trust me if this were not\nso, the world would not live, but would die, smothered by its own\nstink.  Is the wall betwixt us gone, friend?\"\n\nHe smiled as he looked at me, kindly, but sadly and shamefast, and\nshook his head.\n\nThen in a while he said, \"Now ye have seen the images of those who were\nour friends, come and see the images of those who were once our foes.\"\n\nSo he led the way through the side screen into the chancel aisle, and\nthere on the pavement lay the bodies of the foemen, their weapons taken\nfrom them and they stripped of their armour, but not otherwise of their\nclothes, and their faces mostly, but not all, covered.  At the east end\nof the aisle was another altar, covered with a rich cloth beautifully\nfigured, and on the wall over it was a deal of tabernacle work, in the\nmidmost niche of it an image painted and gilt of a gay knight on\nhorseback, cutting his own cloak in two with his sword to give a cantle\nof it to a half-naked beggar. \"Knowest thou any of these men?\" said I.\n\nHe said, \"Some I should know, could I see their faces; but let them be.\"\n\n\"Were they evil men?\" said I.\n\n\"Yea,\" he said, \"some two or three.  But I will not tell thee of them;\nlet St. Martin, whose house this is, tell their story if he will.  As\nfor the rest they were hapless fools, or else men who must earn their\nbread somehow, and were driven to this bad way of earning it; God rest\ntheir souls!  I will be no tale-bearer, not even to God.\"\n\nSo we stood musing a little while, I gazing not on the dead men, but on\nthe strange pictures on the wall, which were richer and deeper coloured\nthan those in the nave; till at last John Ball turned to me and laid\nhis hand on my shoulder.  I started and said, \"Yea, brother; now must I\nget me back to Will Green's house, as I promised to do so timely.\"\n\n\"Not yet, brother,\" said he; \"I have still much to say to thee, and the\nnight is yet young.  Go we and sit in the stalls of the vicars, and let\nus ask and answer on matters concerning the fashion of this world of\nmenfolk, and of this land wherein we dwell; for once more I deem of\nthee that thou hast seen things which I have not seen, and could not\nhave seen.\"  With that word he led me back into the chancel, and we sat\ndown side by side in the stalls at the west end of it, facing the high\naltar and the great east window.  By this time the chancel was getting\ndimmer as the moon wound round the heavens; but yet was there a\ntwilight of the moon, so that I could still see the things about me for\nall the brightness of the window that faced us; and this moon twilight\nwould last, I knew, until the short summer night should wane, and the\ntwilight of the dawn begin to show us the colours of all things about\nus.\n\nSo we sat, and I gathered my thoughts to hear what he would say, and I\nmyself was trying to think what I should ask of him; for I thought of\nhim as he of me, that he had seen things which I could not have seen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTWO TALK OF THE DAYS TO COME\n\n\"Brother,\" said John Ball, \"how deemest thou of our adventure?  I do\nnot ask thee if thou thinkest we are right to play the play like men,\nbut whether playing like men we shall fail like men.\"\n\n\"Why dost thou ask me?\" said I; \"how much further than beyond this\nchurch can I see?\" \"Far further,\" quoth he, \"for I wot that thou art a\nscholar and hast read books; and withal, in some way that I cannot\nname, thou knowest more than we; as though with thee the world had\nlived longer than with us.  Hide not, therefore, what thou hast in\nthine heart, for I think after this night I shall see thee no more,\nuntil we meet in the heavenly Fellowship.\"\n\n\"Friend,\" I said, \"ask me what thou wilt; or rather ask thou the years\nto come to tell thee some little of their tale; and yet methinks thou\nthyself mayest have some deeming thereof.\"\n\nHe raised himself on the elbow of the stall and looked me full in the\nface, and said to me:  \"Is it so after all that thou art no man in the\nflesh, but art sent to me by the Master of the Fellowship, and the\nKing's Son of Heaven, to tell me what shall be?  If that be so tell me\nstraight out, since I had some deeming hereof before; whereas thy\nspeech is like ours and yet unlike, and thy face hath something in it\nwhich is not after the fashion of our day.  And yet take heed, if thou\nart such an one, I fear thee not, nay, nor him that sent thee; nor for\nthy bidding, nor for his, will I turn back from London Bridge but will\npress on, for I do what is meet and right.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said I, \"did I not tell thee e'en now that I knew life but not\ndeath?  I am not dead; and as to who hath sent me, I say not that I am\ncome by my own will; for I know not; yet also I know not the will that\nhath sent me hither.  And this I say to thee, moreover, that if I know\nmore than thou, I do far less; therefore thou art my captain and I thy\nminstrel.\"\n\nHe sighed as one from whom a weight had been lifted, and said: \"Well,\nthen, since thou art alive on the earth and a man like myself, tell me\nhow deemest thou of our adventure: shall we come to London, and how\nshall we fare there?\"\n\nSaid I, \"What shall hinder you to come to London, and to fare there as\nye will?  For be sure that the Fellowship in Essex shall not fail you;\nnor shall the Londoners who hate the king's uncles withstand you; nor\nhath the Court any great force to meet you in the field; ye shall cast\nfear and trembling into their hearts.\"\n\n\"Even so, I thought,\" said he; \"but afterwards what shall betide?\"\n\nSaid I, \"It grieves my heart to say that which I think.  Yet hearken;\nmany a man's son shall die who is now alive and happy, and if the\nsoldiers be slain, and of them most not on the field, but by the\nlawyers, how shall the captains escape?  Surely thou goest to thy\ndeath.\"\n\nHe smiled very sweetly, yet proudly, as he said:  \"Yea, the road is\nlong, but the end cometh at last.  Friend, many a day have I been\ndying; for my sister, with whom I have played and been merry in the\nautumn tide about the edges of the stubble-fields; and we gathered the\nnuts and bramble-berries there, and started thence the missel-thrush,\nand wondered at his voice and thought him big; and the sparrow-hawk\nwheeled and turned over the hedges and the weasel ran across the path,\nand the sound of the sheep-bells came to us from the downs as we sat\nhappy on the grass; and she is dead and gone from the earth, for she\npined from famine after the years of the great sickness; and my brother\nwas slain in the French wars, and none thanked him for dying save he\nthat stripped him of his gear; and my unwedded wife with whom I dwelt\nin love after I had taken the tonsure, and all men said she was good\nand fair, and true she was and lovely; she also is dead and gone from\nthe earth; and why should I abide save for the deeds of the flesh which\nmust be done?  Truly, friend, this is but an old tale that men must\ndie; and I will tell thee another, to wit, that they live: and I live\nnow and shall live.  Tell me then what shall befall.\"\n\nSomehow I could not heed him as a living man as much as I had done, and\nthe voice that came from me seemed less of me as I answered:\n\n\"These men are strong and valiant as any that have been or shall be,\nand good fellows also and kindly; but they are simple, and see no great\nway before their own noses.  The victory shall they have and shall not\nknow what to do with it; they shall fight and overcome, because of\ntheir lack of knowledge, and because of their lack of knowledge shall\nthey be cozened and betrayed when their captains are slain, and all\nshall come to nought by seeming; and the king's uncles shall prevail,\nthat both they and the king may come to the shame that is appointed for\nthem.  And yet when the lords have vanquished, and all England lieth\nunder them again, yet shall their victory be fruitless; for the free\nmen that hold unfree lands shall they not bring under the collar again,\nand villeinage shall slip from their hands, till there be, and not long\nafter ye are dead, but few unfree men in England; so that your lives\nand your deaths both shall bear fruit.\"\n\n\"Said I not,\" quoth John Ball, \"that thou wert a sending from other\ntimes?  Good is thy message, for the land shall be free.  Tell on now.\"\n\nHe spoke eagerly, and I went on somewhat sadly:  \"The times shall\nbetter, though the king and lords shall worsen, the Gilds of Craft\nshall wax and become mightier; more recourse shall there be of foreign\nmerchants.  There shall be plenty in the land and not famine.  Where a\nman now earneth two pennies he shall earn three.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said he, \"then shall those that labour become strong and\nstronger, and so soon shall it come about that all men shall work and\nnone make to work, and so shall none be robbed, and at last shall all\nmen labour and live and be happy, and have the goods of the earth\nwithout money and without price.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said I, \"that shall indeed come to pass, but not yet for a\nwhile, and belike a long while.\"\n\nAnd I sat for long without speaking, and the church grew darker as the\nmoon waned yet more.\n\nThen I said:  \"Bethink thee that these men shall yet have masters over\nthem, who have at hand many a law and custom for the behoof of masters,\nand being masters can make yet more laws in the same behoof; and they\nshall suffer poor people to thrive just so long as their thriving shall\nprofit the mastership and no longer; and so shall it be in those days I\ntell of; for there shall be king and lords and knights and squires\nstill, with servants to do their bidding, and make honest men afraid;\nand all these will make nothing and eat much as aforetime, and the more\nthat is made in the land the more shall they crave.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said he, \"that wot I well, that these are of the kin of the\ndaughters of the horse-leech; but how shall they slake their greed,\nseeing that as thou sayest villeinage shall be gone? Belike their men\nshall pay them quit-rents and do them service, as free men may, but all\nthis according to law and not beyond it; so that though the workers\nshall be richer than they now be, the lords shall be no richer, and so\nall shall be on the road to being free and equal.\"\n\nSaid I, \"Look you, friend; aforetime the lords, for the most part, held\nthe land and all that was on it, and the men that were on it worked for\nthem as their horses worked, and after they were fed and housed all was\nthe lords'; but in the time to come the lords shall see their men\nthriving on the land and shall say once more, 'These men have more than\nthey need, why have we not the surplus since we are their lords?'\nMoreover, in those days shall betide much chaffering for wares between\nman and man, and country and country; and the lords shall note that if\nthere were less corn and less men on their lands there would be more\nsheep, that is to say more wool for chaffer, and that thereof they\nshould have abundantly more than aforetime; since all the land they\nown, and it pays them quit-rent or service, save here and there a croft\nor a close of a yeoman; and all this might grow wool for them to sell\nto the Easterlings.  Then shall England see a new thing, for whereas\nhitherto men have lived on the land and by it, the land shall no longer\nneed them, but many sheep and a few shepherds shall make wool grow to\nbe sold for money to the Easterlings, and that money shall the lords\npouch: for, look you, they shall set the lawyers a-work and the strong\nhand moreover, and the land they shall take to themselves and their\nsheep; and except for these lords of land few shall be the free men\nthat shall hold a rood of land whom the word of their lord may not turn\nadrift straightway.\"\n\n\"How mean you?\" said John Ball: \"shall all men be villeins again?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said I, \"there shall be no villeins in England.\"\n\n\"Surely then,\" said he, \"it shall be worse, and all men save a few\nshall be thralls to be bought and sold at the cross.\"\n\n\"Good friend,\" said I, \"it shall not be so; all men shall be free even\nas ye would have it; yet, as I say, few indeed shall have so much land\nas they can stand upon save by buying such a grace of their masters.\"\n\n\"And now,\" said he, \"I wot not what thou sayest.  I know a thrall, and\nhe is his master's every hour, and never his own; and a villein I know,\nand whiles he is his own and whiles his lord's; and I know a free man,\nand he is his own always; but how shall he be his own if he have nought\nwhereby to make his livelihood?  Or shall he be a thief and take from\nothers?  Then is he an outlaw. Wonderful is this thou tellest of a free\nman with nought whereby to live!\"\n\n\"Yet so it shall be,\" said I, \"and by such free men shall all wares be\nmade.\"\n\n\"Nay, that cannot be; thou art talking riddles,\" said he; \"for how\nshall a woodwright make a chest without the wood and the tools?\"\n\nSaid I, \"He must needs buy leave to labour of them that own all things\nexcept himself and such as himself.\"\n\n\"Yea, but wherewith shall he buy it?\" said John Ball.  \"What hath he\nexcept himself?\"\n\n\"With himself then shall he buy it,\" quoth I, \"with his body and the\npower of labour that lieth therein; with the price of his labour shall\nhe buy leave to labour.\"\n\n\"Riddles again!\" said he; \"how can he sell his labour for aught else\nbut his daily bread?  He must win by his labour meat and drink and\nclothing and housing!  Can he sell his labour twice over?\"\n\n\"Not so,\" said I, \"but this shall he do belike; he shall sell himself,\nthat is the labour that is in him, to the master that suffers him to\nwork, and that master shall give to him from out of the wares he maketh\nenough to keep him alive, and to beget children and nourish them till\nthey be old enough to be sold like himself, and the residue shall the\nrich man keep to himself.\"\n\nJohn Ball laughed aloud, and said:  \"Well, I perceive we are not yet\nout of the land of riddles.  The man may well do what thou sayest and\nlive, but he may not do it and live a free man.\"\n\n\"Thou sayest sooth,\" said I.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nHARD IT IS FOR THE OLD WORLD TO SEE THE NEW\n\nHe held his peace awhile, and then he said:  \"But no man selleth\nhimself and his children into thraldom uncompelled; nor is any fool so\ngreat a fool as willingly to take the name of freeman and the life of a\nthrall as payment for the very life of a freeman. Now would I ask thee\nsomewhat else; and I am the readier to do so since I perceive that thou\nart a wondrous seer; for surely no man could of his own wit have\nimagined a tale of such follies as thou hast told me.  Now well I wot\nthat men having once shaken themselves clear of the burden of\nvilleinage, as thou sayest we shall do (and I bless thee for the word),\nshall never bow down to this worser tyranny without sore strife in the\nworld; and surely so sore shall it be, before our valiant sons give\nway, that maids and little lads shall take the sword and the spear, and\nin many a field men's blood and not water shall turn the gristmills of\nEngland.  But when all this is over, and the tyranny is established,\nbecause there are but few men in the land after the great war, how\nshall it be with you then?  Will there not be many soldiers and\nsergeants and few workers?  Surely in every parish ye shall have the\nconstables to see that the men work; and they shall be saying every\nday, 'Such an one, hast thou yet sold thyself for this day or this week\nor this year?  Go to now, and get thy bargain done, or it shall be the\nworse for thee.'  And wheresoever work is going on there shall be\nconstables again, and those that labour shall labour under the whip\nlike the Hebrews in the land of Egypt.  And every man that may, will\nsteal as a dog snatches at a bone; and there again shall ye need more\nsoldiers and more constables till the land is eaten up by them; nor\nshall the lords and the masters even be able to bear the burden of it;\nnor will their gains be so great, since that which each man may do in a\nday is not right great when all is said.\"\n\n\"Friend,\" said I, \"from thine own valiancy and high heart thou\nspeakest, when thou sayest that they who fall under this tyranny shall\nfight to the death against it.  Wars indeed there shall be in the\nworld, great and grievous, and yet few on this score; rather shall men\nfight as they have been fighting in France at the bidding of some lord\nof the manor, or some king, or at last at the bidding of some usurer\nand forestaller of the market. Valiant men, forsooth, shall arise in\nthe beginning of these evil times, but though they shall die as ye\nshall, yet shall not their deaths be fruitful as yours shall be;\nbecause ye, forsooth, are fighting against villeinage which is waning,\nbut they shall fight against usury which is waxing.  And, moreover, I\nhave been telling thee how it shall be when the measure of the time is\nfull; and we, looking at these things from afar, can see them as they\nare indeed; but they who live at the beginning of those times and\namidst them, shall not know what is doing around them; they shall\nindeed feel the plague and yet not know the remedy; by little and by\nlittle they shall fall from their better livelihood, and weak and\nhelpless shall they grow, and have no might to withstand the evil of\nthis tyranny; and then again when the times mend somewhat and they have\nbut a little more ease, then shall it be to them like the kingdom of\nheaven, and they shall have no will to withstand any tyranny, but shall\nthink themselves happy that they be pinched somewhat less.  Also\nwhereas thou sayest that there shall be for ever constables and\nsergeants going to and fro to drive men to work, and that they will not\nwork save under the lash, thou art wrong and it shall not be so; for\nthere shall ever be more workers than the masters may set to work, so\nthat men shall strive eagerly for leave to work; and when one says, I\nwill sell my hours at such and such a price, then another will say, and\nI for so much less; so that never shall the lords lack slaves willing\nto work, but often the slaves shall lack lords to buy them.\"\n\n\"Thou tellest marvels indeed,\" said he; \"but how then? if all the\nchurls work not, shall there not be famine and lack of wares?\"\n\n\"Famine enough,\" said I, \"yet not from lack of wares; it shall be clean\ncontrary.  What wilt thou say when I tell thee that in the latter days\nthere shall be such traffic and such speedy travel across the seas that\nmost wares shall be good cheap, and bread of all things the cheapest?\"\n\nQuoth he:  \"I should say that then there would be better livelihood for\nmen, for in times of plenty it is well; for then men eat that which\ntheir own hands have harvested, and need not to spend of their\nsubstance in buying of others.  Truly, it is well for honest men, but\nnot so well for forestallers and regraters;[2] but who heeds what\nbefalls such foul swine, who filch the money from people's purses, and\ndo not one hair's turn of work to help them?\"\n\n\"Yea, friend,\" I said, \"but in those latter days all power shall be in\nthe hands of these foul swine, and they shall be the rulers of all;\ntherefore, hearken, for I tell thee that times of plenty shall in those\ndays be the times of famine, and all shall pray for the prices of wares\nto rise, so that the forestallers and regraters may thrive, and that\nsome of their well-doing may overflow on to those on whom they live.\"\n\n\"I am weary of thy riddles,\" he said.  \"Yet at least I hope that there\nmay be fewer and fewer folk in the land; as may well be, if life is\nthen so foul and wretched.\"\n\n\"Alas, poor man!\" I said; \"nor mayst thou imagine how foul and wretched\nit may be for many of the folk; and yet I tell thee that men shall\nincrease and multiply, till where there is one man in the land now,\nthere shall be twenty in those days--yea, in some places ten times\ntwenty.\"\n\n\"I have but little heart to ask thee more questions,\" said he; \"and\nwhen thou answerest, thy words are plain, but the things they tell of I\nmay scarce understand.  But tell me this: in those days will men deem\nthat so it must be for ever, as great men even now tell us of our ills,\nor will they think of some remedy?\"\n\nI looked about me.  There was but a glimmer of light in the church now,\nbut what there was, was no longer the strange light of the moon, but\nthe first coming of the kindly day.\n\n\"Yea,\" said John Ball, \"'tis the twilight of the dawn.  God and St.\nChristopher send us a good day!\"\n\n\"John Ball,\" said I, \"I have told thee that thy death will bring about\nthat which thy life has striven for: thinkest thou that the thing which\nthou strivest for is worth the labour? or dost thou believe in the tale\nI have told thee of the days to come?\"\n\nHe said:  \"I tell thee once again that I trust thee for a seer; because\nno man could make up such a tale as thou; the things which thou tellest\nare too wonderful for a minstrel, the tale too grievous.  And whereas\nthou askest as to whether I count my labour lost, I say nay; if so be\nthat in those latter times (and worser than ours they will be) men\nshall yet seek a remedy: therefore again I ask thee, is it so that they\nshall?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said I, \"and their remedy shall be the same as thine, although\nthe days be different: for if the folk be enthralled, what remedy save\nthat they be set free? and if they have tried many roads towards\nfreedom, and found that they led no-whither, then shall they try yet\nanother.  Yet in the days to come they shall be slothful to try it,\nbecause their masters shall be so much mightier than thine, that they\nshall not need to show the high hand, and until the days get to their\nevilest, men shall be cozened into thinking that it is of their own\nfree will that they must needs buy leave to labour by pawning their\nlabour that is to be.  Moreover, your lords and masters seem very\nmighty to you, each one of them, and so they are, but they are few; and\nthe masters of the days to come shall not each one of them seem very\nmighty to the men of those days, but they shall be very many, and they\nshall be of one intent in these matters without knowing it; like as one\nsees the oars of a galley when the rowers are hidden, that rise and\nfall as it were with one will.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" he said, \"shall it not be the same with those that these men\ndevour? shall not they also have one will?\"\n\n\"Friend,\" I said, \"they shall have the will to live, as the wretchedest\nthing living has: therefore shall they sell themselves that they may\nlive, as I told thee; and their hard need shall be their lord's easy\nlivelihood, and because of it he shall sleep without fear, since their\nneed compelleth them not to loiter by the way to lament with friend or\nbrother that they are pinched in their servitude, or to devise means\nfor ending it. And yet indeed thou sayest it: they also shall have one\nwill if they but knew it: but for a long while they shall have but a\nglimmer of knowledge of it: yet doubt it not that in the end they shall\ncome to know it clearly, and then shall they bring about the remedy;\nand in those days shall it be seen that thou hast not wrought for\nnothing, because thou hast seen beforehand what the remedy should be,\neven as those of later days have seen it.\"\n\nWe both sat silent a little while.  The twilight was gaining on the\nnight, though slowly.  I looked at the poppy which I still held in my\nhand, and bethought me of Will Green, and said:\n\n\"Lo, how the light is spreading: now must I get me back to Will Green's\nhouse as I promised.\"\n\n\"Go, then,\" said he, \"if thou wilt.  Yet meseems before long he shall\ncome to us; and then mayst thou sleep among the trees on the green\ngrass till the sun is high, for the host shall not be on foot very\nearly; and sweet it is to sleep in shadow by the sun in the full\nmorning when one has been awake and troubled through the night-tide.\"\n\n\"Yet I will go now,\" said I; \"I bid thee good-night, or rather\ngood-morrow.\"\n\nTherewith I half rose up; but as I did so the will to depart left me as\nthough I had never had it, and I sat down again, and heard the voice of\nJohn Ball, at first as one speaking from far away, but little by little\ngrowing nearer and more familiar to me, and as if once more it were\ncoming from the man himself whom I had got to know.\n\n\n\n[2] Forestaller, one who buys up goods when they are cheap, and so\nraises the price for his own benefit; forestalls the due and real\ndemand.  Regrater, one who both buys and sells in the same market, or\nwithin five miles thereof; buys, say a ton of cheese at 10 A.M. and\nsells it at 5 P.M. a penny a pound dearer without moving from his\nchair.  The word \"monopolist\" will cover both species of thief.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nILL WOULD CHANGE BE AT WHILES WERE IT NOT FOR\n  THE CHANGE BEYOND THE CHANGE\n\nHe said:  \"Many strange things hast thou told me that I could not\nunderstand; yea, some my wit so failed to compass, that I cannot so\nmuch as ask thee questions concerning them; but of some matters would I\nask thee, and I must hasten, for in very sooth the night is worn old\nand grey.  Whereas thou sayest that in the days to come, when there\nshall be no labouring men who are not thralls after their new fashion,\nthat their lords shall be many and very many, it seemeth to me that\nthese same lords, if they be many, shall hardly be rich, or but very\nfew of them, since they must verily feed and clothe and house their\nthralls, so that that which they take from them, since it will have to\nbe dealt out amongst many, will not be enough to make many rich; since\nout of one man ye may get but one man's work; and pinch him never so\nsorely, still as aforesaid ye may not pinch him so sorely as not to\nfeed him.  Therefore, though the eyes of my mind may see a few lords\nand many slaves, yet can they not see many lords as well as many\nslaves; and if the slaves be many and the lords few, then some day\nshall the slaves make an end of that mastery by the force of their\nbodies.  How then shall thy mastership of the latter days endure?\"\n\n\"John Ball,\" said I, \"mastership hath many shifts whereby it striveth\nto keep itself alive in the world.  And now hear a marvel: whereas thou\nsayest these two times that out of one man ye may get but one man's\nwork, in days to come one man shall do the work of a hundred men--yea,\nof a thousand or more: and this is the shift of mastership that shall\nmake many masters and many rich men.\"\n\nJohn Ball laughed.  \"Great is my harvest of riddles to-night,\" said he;\n\"for even if a man sleep not, and eat and drink while he is a-working,\nye shall but make two men, or three at the most, out of him.\"\n\nSaid I:  \"Sawest thou ever a weaver at his loom?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said he, \"many a time.\"\n\nHe was silent a little, and then said:  \"Yet I marvelled not at it; but\nnow I marvel, because I know what thou wouldst say.  Time was when the\nshuttle was thrust in and out of all the thousand threads of the warp,\nand it was long to do; but now the spring-staves go up and down as the\nman's feet move, and this and that leaf of the warp cometh forward and\nthe shuttle goeth in one shot through all the thousand warps.  Yea, so\nit is that this multiplieth a man many times.  But look you, he is so\nmultiplied already; and so hath he been, meseemeth, for many hundred\nyears.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said I, \"but what hitherto needed the masters to multiply him\nmore?  For many hundred years the workman was a thrall bought and sold\nat the cross; and for other hundreds of years he hath been a villein--\nthat is, a working-beast and a part of the stock of the manor on which\nhe liveth; but then thou and the like of thee shall free him, and then\nis mastership put to its shifts; for what should avail the mastery\nthen, when the master no longer owneth the man by law as his chattel,\nnor any longer by law owneth him as stock of his land, if the master\nhath not that which he on whom he liveth may not lack and live withal,\nand cannot have without selling himself?\"\n\nHe said nothing, but I saw his brow knitted and his lips pressed\ntogether as though in anger; and again I said:\n\n\"Thou hast seen the weaver at his loom: think how it should be if he\nsit no longer before the web and cast the shuttle and draw home the\nsley, but if the shed open of itself and the shuttle of itself speed\nthrough it as swift as the eye can follow, and the sley come home of\nitself; and the weaver standing by and whistling The Hunt's Up! the\nwhile, or looking to half-a-dozen looms and bidding them what to do.\nAnd as with the weaver so with the potter, and the smith, and every\nworker in metals, and all other crafts, that it shall be for them\nlooking on and tending, as with the man that sitteth in the cart while\nthe horse draws.  Yea, at last so shall it be even with those who are\nmere husbandmen; and no longer shall the reaper fare afield in the\nmorning with his hook over his shoulder, and smite and bind and smite\nagain till the sun is down and the moon is up; but he shall draw a\nthing made by men into the field with one or two horses, and shall say\nthe word and the horses shall go up and down, and the thing shall reap\nand gather and bind, and do the work of many men.  Imagine all this in\nthy mind if thou canst, at least as ye may imagine a tale of\nenchantment told by a minstrel, and then tell me what shouldst thou\ndeem that the life of men would be amidst all this, men such as these\nmen of the township here, or the men of the Canterbury gilds.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said he; \"but before I tell thee my thoughts of thy tale of\nwonder, I would ask thee this:  In those days when men work so easily,\nsurely they shall make more wares than they can use in one countryside,\nor one good town, whereas in another, where things have not gone as\nwell, they shall have less than they need; and even so it is with us\nnow, and thereof cometh scarcity and famine; and if people may not come\nat each other's goods, it availeth the whole land little that one\ncountry-side hath more than enough while another hath less; for the\ngoods shall abide there in the storehouses of the rich place till they\nperish.  So if that be so in the days of wonder ye tell of (and I see\nnot how it can be otherwise), then shall men be but little holpen by\nmaking all their wares so easily and with so little labour.\"\n\nI smiled again and said:  \"Yea, but it shall not be so; not only shall\nmen be multiplied a hundred and a thousand fold, but the distance of\none place from another shall be as nothing; so that the wares which lie\nready for market in Durham in the evening may be in London on the\nmorrow morning; and the men of Wales may eat corn of Essex and the men\nof Essex wear wool of Wales; so that, so far as the flitting of goods\nto market goes, all the land shall be as one parish.  Nay, what say I?\nNot as to this land only shall it be so, but even the Indies, and far\ncountries of which thou knowest not, shall be, so to say, at every\nman's door, and wares which now ye account precious and dear-bought,\nshall then be common things bought and sold for little price at every\nhuckster's stall.  Say then, John, shall not those days be merry, and\nplentiful of ease and contentment for all men?\"\n\n\"Brother,\" said he, \"meseemeth some doleful mockery lieth under these\njoyful tidings of thine; since thou hast already partly told me to my\nsad bewilderment what the life of man shall be in those days.  Yet will\nI now for a little set all that aside to consider thy strange tale as\nof a minstrel from over sea, even as thou biddest me.  Therefore I say,\nthat if men still abide men as I have known them, and unless these folk\nof England change as, the land changeth--and forsooth of the men, for\ngood and for evil, I can think no other than I think now, or behold\nthem other than I have known them and loved them--I say if the men be\nstill men, what will happen except that there should be all plenty in\nthe land, and not one poor man therein, unless of his own free will he\nchoose to lack and be poor, as a man in religion or such like; for\nthere would then be such abundance of all good things, that, as greedy\nas the lords might be, there would be enough to satisfy their greed and\nyet leave good living for all who laboured with their hands; so that\nthese should labour far less than now, and they would have time to\nlearn knowledge, so that there should be no learned or unlearned, for\nall should be learned; and they would have time also to learn how to\norder the matters of the parish and the hundred, and of the parliament\nof the realm, so that the king should take no more than his own; and to\norder the rule of the realm, so that all men, rich and unrich, should\nhave part therein; and so by undoing of evil laws and making of good\nones, that fashion would come to an end whereof thou speakest, that\nrich men make laws for their own behoof; for they should no longer be\nable to do thus when all had part in making the laws; whereby it would\nsoon come about that there would be no men rich and tyrannous, but all\nshould have enough and to spare of the increase of the earth and the\nwork of their own hands.  Yea surely, brother, if ever it cometh about\nthat men shall be able to make things, and not men, work for their\nsuperfluities, and that the length of travel from one place to another\nbe made of no account, and all the world be a market for all the world,\nthen all shall live in health and wealth; and envy and grudging shall\nperish.  For then shall we have conquered the earth and it shall be\nenough; and then shall the kingdom of heaven be come down to the earth\nin very deed.  Why lookest thou so sad and sorry? what sayest thou?\"\n\nI said:  \"Hast thou forgotten already what I told thee, that in those\nlatter days a man who hath nought save his own body (and such men shall\nbe far the most of men) must needs pawn his labour for leave to labour?\nCan such a man be wealthy?  Hast thou not called him a thrall?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" he said; \"but how could I deem that such things could be when\nthose days should be come wherein men could make things work for them?\"\n\n\"Poor man!\" said I.  \"Learn that in those very days, when it shall be\nwith the making of things as with the carter in the cart, that there he\nsitteth and shaketh the reins and the horse draweth and the cart goeth;\nin those days, I tell thee, many men shall be as poor and wretched\nalways, year by year, as they are with thee when there is famine in the\nland; nor shall any have plenty and surety of livelihood save those\nthat shall sit by and look on while others labour; and these, I tell\nthee, shall be a many, so that they shall see to the making of all\nlaws, and in their hands shall be all power, and the labourers shall\nthink that they cannot do without these men that live by robbing them,\nand shall praise them and wellnigh pray to them as ye pray to the\nsaints, and the best worshipped man in the land shall be he who by\nforestalling and regrating hath gotten to him the most money.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said he, \"and shall they who see themselves robbed worship the\nrobber?  Then indeed shall men be changed from what they are now, and\nthey shall be sluggards, dolts, and cowards beyond all the earth hath\nyet borne.  Such are not the men I have known in my life-days, and that\nnow I love in my death.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" I said, \"but the robbery shall they not see; for have I not told\nthee that they shall hold themselves to be free men? And for why?  I\nwill tell thee: but first tell me how it fares with men now; may the\nlabouring man become a lord?\"\n\nHe said:  \"The thing hath been seen that churls have risen from the\ndortoir of the monastery to the abbot's chair and the bishop's throne;\nyet not often; and whiles hath a bold sergeant become a wise captain,\nand they have made him squire and knight; and yet but very seldom.  And\nnow I suppose thou wilt tell me that the Church will open her arms\nwider to this poor people, and that many through her shall rise into\nlordship.  But what availeth that?  Nought were it to me if the Abbot\nof St. Alban's with his golden mitre sitting guarded by his knights and\nsergeants, or the Prior of Merton with his hawks and his hounds, had\nonce been poor men, if they were now tyrants of poor men; nor would it\nbetter the matter if there were ten times as many Houses of Religion in\nthe land as now are, and each with a churl's son for abbot or prior\nover it.\"\n\nI smiled and said:  \"Comfort thyself; for in those days shall there be\nneither abbey nor priory in the land, nor monks nor friars, nor any\nreligious.\"  (He started as I spoke.)  \"But thou hast told me that\nhardly in these days may a poor man rise to be a lord: now I tell thee\nthat in the days to come poor men shall be able to become lords and\nmasters and do-nothings; and oft will it be seen that they shall do so;\nand it shall be even for that cause that their eyes shall be blinded to\nthe robbing of themselves by others, because they shall hope in their\nsouls that they may each live to rob others: and this shall be the very\nsafeguard of all rule and law in those days.\"\n\n\"Now am I sorrier than thou hast yet made me,\" said he; \"for when once\nthis is established, how then can it be changed? Strong shall be the\ntyranny of the latter days.  And now meseems, if thou sayest sooth,\nthis time of the conquest of the earth shall not bring heaven down to\nthe earth, as erst I deemed it would, but rather that it shall bring\nhell up on to the earth. Woe's me, brother, for thy sad and weary\nforetelling!  And yet saidst thou that the men of those days would seek\na remedy. Canst thou yet tell me, brother, what that remedy shall be,\nlest the sun rise upon me made hopeless by thy tale of what is to be?\nAnd, lo you, soon shall she rise upon the earth.\"\n\nIn truth the dawn was widening now, and the colours coming into the\npictures on wall and in window; and as well as I could see through the\nvaried glazing of these last (and one window before me had as yet\nnothing but white glass in it), the ruddy glow, which had but so little\na while quite died out in the west, was now beginning to gather in the\neast--the new day was beginning.  I looked at the poppy that I still\ncarried in my hand, and it seemed to me to have withered and dwindled.\nI felt anxious to speak to my companion and tell him much, and withal I\nfelt that I must hasten, or for some reason or other I should be too\nlate; so I spoke at last loud and hurriedly:\n\n\"John Ball, be of good cheer; for once more thou knowest, as I know,\nthat the Fellowship of Men shall endure, however many tribulations it\nmay have to wear through.  Look you, a while ago was the light bright\nabout us; but it was because of the moon, and the night was deep\nnotwithstanding, and when the moonlight waned and died, and there was\nbut a little glimmer in place of the bright light, yet was the world\nglad because all things knew that the glimmer was of day and not of\nnight.  Lo you, an image of the times to betide the hope of the\nFellowship of Men. Yet forsooth, it may well be that this bright day of\nsummer which is now dawning upon us is no image of the beginning of the\nday that shall be; but rather shall that day-dawn be cold and grey and\nsurly; and yet by its light shall men see things as they verily are,\nand no longer enchanted by the gleam of the moon and the glamour of the\ndream-tide.  By such grey light shall wise men and valiant souls see\nthe remedy, and deal with it, a real thing that may be touched and\nhandled, and no glory of the heavens to be worshipped from afar off.\nAnd what shall it be, as I told thee before, save that men shall be\ndetermined to be free; yea, free as thou wouldst have them, when thine\nhope rises the highest, and thou art thinking not of the king's uncles,\nand poll-groat bailiffs, and the villeinage of Essex, but of the end of\nall, when men shall have the fruits of the earth and the fruits of\ntheir toil thereon, without money and without price.  The time shall\ncome, John Ball, when that dream of thine that this shall one day be,\nshall be a thing that men shall talk of soberly, and as a thing soon to\ncome about, as even with thee they talk of the villeins becoming\ntenants paying their lord quit-rent; therefore, hast thou done well to\nhope it; and, if thou heedest this also, as I suppose thou heedest it\nlittle, thy name shall abide by thy hope in those days to come, and\nthou shalt not be forgotten.\"\n\nI heard his voice come out of the twilight, scarcely seeing him, though\nnow the light was growing fast, as he said:\n\n\"Brother, thou givest me heart again; yet since now I wot well that\nthou art a sending from far-off times and far-off things: tell thou, if\nthou mayest, to a man who is going to his death how this shall come\nabout.\"\n\n\"Only this may I tell thee\" said I; \"to thee, when thou didst try to\nconceive of them, the ways of the days to come seemed follies scarce to\nbe thought of; yet shall they come to be familiar things, and an order\nby which every man liveth, ill as he liveth, so that men shall deem of\nthem, that thus it hath been since the beginning of the world, and that\nthus it shall be while the world endureth; and in this wise so shall\nthey be thought of a long while; and the complaint of the poor the rich\nman shall heed, even as much and no more as he who lieth in pleasure\nunder the lime-trees in the summer heedeth the murmur of his toiling\nbees.  Yet in time shall this also grow old, and doubt shall creep in,\nbecause men shall scarce be able to live by that order, and the\ncomplaint of the poor shall be hearkened, no longer as a tale not\nutterly grievous, but as a threat of ruin, and a fear. Then shall these\nthings, which to thee seem follies, and to the men between thee and me\nmere wisdom and the bond of stability, seem follies once again; yet,\nwhereas men have so long lived by them, they shall cling to them yet\nfrom blindness and from fear; and those that see, and that have thus\nmuch conquered fear that they are furthering the real time that cometh\nand not the dream that faileth, these men shall the blind and the\nfearful mock and missay, and torment and murder: and great and grievous\nshall be the strife in those days, and many the failures of the wise,\nand too oft sore shall be the despair of the valiant; and back-sliding,\nand doubt, and contest between friends and fellows lacking time in the\nhubbub to understand each other, shall grieve many hearts and hinder\nthe Host of the Fellowship: yet shall all bring about the end, till thy\ndeeming of folly and ours shall be one, and thy hope and our hope; and\nthen--the Day will have come.\"\n\nOnce more I heard the voice of John Ball:  \"Now, brother, I say\nfarewell; for now verily hath the Day of the Earth come, and thou and I\nare lonely of each other again; thou hast been a dream to me as I to\nthee, and sorry and glad have we made each other, as tales of old time\nand the longing of times to come shall ever make men to be.  I go to\nlife and to death, and leave thee; and scarce do I know whether to wish\nthee some dream of the days beyond thine to tell what shall be, as thou\nhast told me, for I know not if that shall help or hinder thee; but\nsince we have been kind and very friends, I will not leave thee without\na wish of good-will, so at least I wish thee what thou thyself wishest\nfor thyself, and that is hopeful strife and blameless peace, which is\nto say in one word, life.  Farewell, friend.\"\n\nFor some little time, although I had known that the daylight was\ngrowing and what was around me, I had scarce seen the things I had\nbefore noted so keenly; but now in a flash I saw all--the east crimson\nwith sunrise through the white window on my right hand; the\nrichly-carved stalls and gilded screen work, the pictures on the walls,\nthe loveliness of the faultless colour of the mosaic window lights, the\naltar and the red light over it looking strange in the daylight, and\nthe biers with the hidden dead men upon them that lay before the high\naltar.  A great pain filled my heart at the sight of all that beauty,\nand withal I heard quick steps coming up the paved church-path to the\nporch, and the loud whistle of a sweet old tune therewith; then the\nfootsteps stopped at the door; I heard the latch rattle, and knew that\nWill Green's hand was on the ring of it.\n\nThen I strove to rise up, but fell back again; a white light, empty of\nall sights, broke upon me for a moment, and lo I behold, I was lying in\nmy familiar bed, the south-westerly gale rattling the Venetian blinds\nand making their hold-fasts squeak.\n\nI got up presently, and going to the window looked out on the winter\nmorning; the river was before me broad between outer bank and bank, but\nit was nearly dead ebb, and there was a wide space of mud on each side\nof the hurrying stream, driven on the faster as it seemed by the push\nof the south-west wind.  On the other side of the water the few\nwillow-trees left us by the Thames Conservancy looked doubtfully alive\nagainst the bleak sky and the row of wretched-looking blue-slated\nhouses, although, by the way, the latter were the backs of a sort of\nstreet of \"villas\" and not a slum; the road in front of the house was\nsooty and muddy at once, and in the air was that sense of dirty\ndiscomfort which one is never quit of in London.  The morning was\nharsh, too, and though the wind was from the south-west it was as cold\nas a north wind; and yet amidst it all, I thought of the corner of the\nnext bight of the river which I could not quite see from where I was,\nbut over which one can see clear of houses and into Richmond Park,\nlooking like the open country; and dirty as the river was, and harsh as\nwas the January wind, they seemed to woo me toward the country-side,\nwhere away from the miseries of the \"Great Wen\" I might of my own will\ncarry on a daydream of the friends I had made in the dream of the night\nand against my will.\n\nBut as I turned away shivering and downhearted, on a sudden came the\nfrightful noise of the \"hooters,\" one after the other, that call the\nworkmen to the factories, this one the after-breakfast one, more by\ntoken.  So I grinned surlily, and dressed and got ready for my day's\n\"work\" as I call it, but which many a man besides John Ruskin (though\nnot many in his position) would call \"play.\"\n\n\n\n\nA KING'S LESSON\n\n\nIt is told of Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary--the Alfred the Great\nof his time and people--that he once heard (once ONLY?) that some (only\nSOME, my lad?) of his peasants were over-worked and under-fed.  So he\nsent for his Council, and bade come thereto also some of the mayors of\nthe good towns, and some of the lords of land and their bailiffs, and\nasked them of the truth thereof; and in diverse ways they all told one\nand the same tale, how the peasant carles were stout and well able to\nwork and had enough and to spare of meat and drink, seeing that they\nwere but churls; and how if they worked not at the least as hard as\nthey did, it would be ill for them and ill for their lords; for that\nthe more the churl hath the more he asketh; and that when he knoweth\nwealth, he knoweth the lack of it also, as it fared with our first\nparents in the Garden of God.  The King sat and said but little while\nthey spake, but he misdoubted them that they were liars.  So the\nCouncil brake up with nothing done; but the King took the matter to\nheart, being, as kings go, a just man, besides being more valiant than\nthey mostly were, even in the old feudal time.  So within two or three\ndays, says the tale, he called together such lords and councillors as\nhe deemed fittest, and bade busk them for a ride; and when they were\nready he and they set out, over rough and smooth, decked out in all the\nglory of attire which was the wont of those days.  Thus they rode till\nthey came to some village or thorpe of the peasant folk, and through it\nto the vineyards where men were working on the sunny southern slopes\nthat went up from the river: my tale does not say whether that were\nTheiss, or Donau, or what river.  Well, I judge it was late spring or\nearly summer, and the vines but just beginning to show their grapes;\nfor the vintage is late in those lands, and some of the grapes are not\ngathered till the first frosts have touched them, whereby the wine made\nfrom them is the stronger and sweeter.  Anyhow there were the peasants,\nmen and women, boys and young maidens, toiling and swinking; some\nhoeing between the vine-rows, some bearing baskets of dung up the steep\nslopes, some in one way, some in another, labouring for the fruit they\nshould never eat, and the wine they should never drink. Thereto turned\nthe King and got off his horse and began to climb up the stony ridges\nof the vineyard, and his lords in like manner followed him, wondering\nin their hearts what was toward; but to the one who was following next\nafter him he turned about and said with a smile, \"Yea, lords, this is a\nnew game we are playing to-day, and a new knowledge will come from it.\"\nAnd the lord smiled, but somewhat sourly.\n\nAs for the peasants, great was their fear of those gay and golden\nlords.  I judge that they did not know the King, since it was little\nlikely that any one of them had seen his face; and they knew of him but\nas the Great Father, the mighty warrior who kept the Turk from harrying\ntheir thorpe.  Though, forsooth, little matter was it to any man there\nwhether Turk or Magyar was their over-lord, since to one master or\nanother they had to pay the due tale of labouring days in the year, and\nhard was the livelihood that they earned for themselves on the days\nwhen they worked for themselves and their wives and children.\n\nWell, belike they knew not the King; but amidst those rich lords they\nsaw and knew their own lord, and of him they were sore afraid.  But\nnought it availed them to flee away from those strong men and strong\nhorses--they who had been toiling from before the rising of the sun,\nand now it wanted little more than an hour of noon: besides, with the\nKing and lords was a guard of crossbowmen, who were left the other side\nof the vineyard wall,--keen-eyed Italians of the mountains, straight\nshooters of the bolt.  So the poor folk fled not; nay they made as if\nall this were none of their business, and went on with their work.  For\nindeed each man said to himself, \"If I be the one that is not slain,\nto-morrow I shall lack bread if I do not work my hardest to-day; and\nmaybe I shall be headman if some of these be slain and I live.\"\n\nNow comes the King amongst them and says:  \"Good fellows, which of you\nis the headman?\"\n\nSpake a man, sturdy and sunburnt, well on in years and grizzled: \"I am\nthe headman, lord.\"\n\n\"Give me thy hoe, then,\" says the King; \"for now shall I order this\nmatter myself, since these lords desire a new game, and are fain to\nwork under me at vine-dressing.  But do thou stand by me and set me\nright if I order them wrong: but the rest of you go play!\"\n\nThe carle knew not what to think, and let the King stand with his hand\nstretched out, while he looked askance at his own lord and baron, who\nwagged his head at him grimly as one who says, \"Do it, dog!\"\n\nThen the carle lets the hoe come into the King's hand; and the King\nfalls to, and orders his lords for vine-dressing, to each his due share\nof the work: and whiles the carle said yea and whiles nay to his\nordering.  And then ye should have seen velvet cloaks cast off, and\nmantles of fine Flemish scarlet go to the dusty earth; as the lords and\nknights busked them to the work.\n\nSo they buckled to; and to most of them it seemed good game to play at\nvine-dressing.  But one there was who, when his scarlet cloak was off,\nstood up in a doublet of glorious Persian web of gold and silk, such as\nmen make not now, worth a hundred florins the Bremen ell.  Unto him the\nKing with no smile on his face gave the job of toing and froing up and\ndown the hill with the biggest and the frailest dung-basket that there\nwas; and thereat the silken lord screwed up a grin, that was sport to\nsee, and all the lords laughed; and as he turned away he said, yet so\nthat none heard him, \"Do I serve this son's son of a whore that he\nshould bid me carry dung?\"  For you must know that the King's father,\nJohn Hunyad, one of the great warriors of the world, the Hammer of the\nTurks, was not gotten in wedlock, though he were a king's son.\n\nWell, they sped the work bravely for a while, and loud was the laughter\nas the hoes smote the earth and the flint stones tinkled and the cloud\nof dust rose up; the brocaded dung-bearer went up and down, cursing and\nswearing by the White God and the Black; and one would say to another,\n\"See ye how gentle blood outgoes churls' blood, even when the gentle\ndoes the churl's work: these lazy loons smote but one stroke to our\nthree.\"  But the King, who worked no worse than any, laughed not at\nall; and meanwhile the poor folk stood by, not daring to speak a word\none to the other; for they were still sore afraid, not now of being\nslain on the spot, but this rather was in their hearts: \"These great\nand strong lords and knights have come to see what work a man may do\nwithout dying: if we are to have yet more days added to our year's tale\nof lords' labour, then are we lost without remedy.\" And their hearts\nsank within them.\n\nSo sped the work; and the sun rose yet higher in the heavens, and it\nwas noon and more.  And now there was no more laughter among those\ntoiling lords, and the strokes of the hoe and mattock came far slower,\nwhile the dung-bearer sat down at the bottom of the hill and looked out\non the river; but the King yet worked on doggedly, so for shame the\nother lords yet kept at it.  Till at last the next man to the King let\nhis hoe drop with a clatter, and swore a great oath.  Now he was a\nstrong black-bearded man in the prime of life, a valiant captain of\nthat famous Black Band that had so often rent the Turkish array; and\nthe King loved him for his sturdy valour; so he says to him, \"Is aught\nwrong, Captain?\"\n\n\"Nay, lord,\" says he, \"ask the headman carle yonder what ails us.\"\n\n\"Headman,\" says the King, \"what ails these strong knights?  Have I\nordered them wrongly?\"\n\n\"Nay, but shirking ails them, lord,\" says he, \"for they are weary; and\nno wonder, for they have been playing hard, and are of gentle blood.\"\n\n\"Is that so, lord,\" says the King, \"that ye are weary already?\"\n\nThen the rest hung their heads and said nought, all save that captain\nof war; and he said, being a bold man and no liar: \"King, I see what\nthou wouldst be at; thou hast brought us here to preach us a sermon\nfrom that Plato of thine; and to say sooth, so that I may swink no\nmore, and go eat my dinner, now preach thy worst!  Nay, if thou wilt be\npriest I will be thy deacon.  Wilt thou that I ask this labouring carle\na thing or two?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said the King.  And there came, as it were, a cloud of thought\nover his face.\n\nThen the captain straddled his legs and looked big, and said to the\ncarle:  \"Good fellow, how long have we been working here?\"\n\n\"Two hours or thereabout, judging by the sun above us,\" says he.\n\n\"And how much of thy work have we done in that while?\" says the\ncaptain, and winks his eye at him withal.\n\n\"Lord,\" says the carle, grinning a little despite himself, \"be not\nwroth with my word.  In the first half-hour ye did five-and-forty\nminutes' work of ours, and in the next half-hour scant a thirty\nminutes' work, and the third half-hour a fifteen minutes' work, and in\nthe fourth half-hour two minutes' work.\"  The grin now had faded from\nhis face, but a gleam came into his eyes as he said:  \"And now, as I\nsuppose, your day's work is done, and ye will go to your dinner, and\neat the sweet and drink the strong; and we shall eat a little\nrye-bread, and then be working here till after the sun has set and the\nmoon has begun to cast shadows.  Now for you, I wot not how ye shall\nsleep nor where, nor what white body ye shall hold in your arms while\nthe night flits and the stars shine; but for us, while the stars yet\nshine, shall we be at it again, and bethink ye for what!  I know not\nwhat game and play ye shall be devising for to-morrow as ye ride back\nhome; but for us when we come back here to-morrow, it shall be as if\nthere had been no yesterday and nothing done therein, and that work of\nthat to-day shall be nought to us also, for we shall win no respite\nfrom our toil thereby, and the morrow of to-morrow will all be to begin\nagain once more, and so on and on till no to-morrow abideth us.\nTherefore, if ye are thinking to lay some new tax or tale upon us,\nthink twice of it, for we may not bear it.  And all this I say with the\nless fear, because I perceive this man here beside me, in the black\nvelvet jerkin and the gold chain on his neck, is the King; nor do I\nthink he will slay me for my word since he hath so many a Turk before\nhim and his mighty sword!\"\n\nThen said the captain:  \"Shall I smite the man, O King? or hath he\npreached thy sermon for thee?\"\n\n\"Smite not, for he hath preached it,\" said the King.  \"Hearken to the\ncarle's sermon, lords and councillors of mine!  Yet when another hath\nspoken our thought, other thoughts are born therefrom, and now have I\nanother sermon to preach; but I will refrain me as now.  Let us down\nand to our dinner.\"\n\nSo they went, the King and his gentles, and sat down by the river under\nthe rustle of the poplars, and they ate and drank and were merry.  And\nthe King bade bear up the broken meats to the vine-dressers, and a good\ndraught of the archer's wine, and to the headman he gave a broad gold\npiece, and to each man three silver pennies.  But when the poor folk\nhad all that under their hands, it was to them as though the kingdom of\nheaven had come down to earth.\n\nIn the cool of the evening home rode the King and his lords.  The King\nwas distraught and silent; but at last the captain, who rode beside\nhim, said to him:  \"Preach me now thine after-sermon, O King!\"\n\n\"I think thou knowest it already,\" said the King, \"else hadst thou not\nspoken in such wise to the carle; but tell me what is thy craft and the\ncraft of all these, whereby ye live, as the potter by making pots, and\nso forth?\"\n\nSaid the captain:  \"As the potter lives by making pots, so we live by\nrobbing the poor.\"\n\nAgain said the King:  \"And my trade?\"\n\nSaid he, \"Thy trade is to be a king of such thieves, yet no worser than\nthe rest.\"\n\nThe King laughed.\n\n\"Bear that in mind,\" said he, \"and then shall I tell thee my thought\nwhile yonder carle spake.  'Carle,' I thought, 'were I thou or such as\nthou, then would I take in my hand a sword or a spear, or were it only\na hedge-stake, and bid others do the like, and forth would we go; and\nsince we would be so many, and with nought to lose save a miserable\nlife, we would do battle and prevail, and make an end of the craft of\nkings and of lords and of usurers, and there should be but one craft in\nthe world, to wit, to work merrily for ourselves and to live merrily\nthereby.'\"\n\nSaid the captain:  \"This then is thy sermon.  Who will heed it if thou\npreach it?\"\n\nSaid the King:  \"They who will take the mad king and put him in a\nking's madhouse, therefore do I forbear to preach it.  Yet it SHALL be\npreached.\"\n\n\"And not heeded,\" said the captain, \"save by those who head and hang\nthe setters forth of new things that are good for the world. Our trade\nis safe for many an many a generation.\"\n\nAnd therewith they came to the King's palace, and they ate and drank\nand slept and the world went on its ways."
