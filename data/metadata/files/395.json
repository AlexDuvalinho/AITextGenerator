R. BUCKLAND_.\n\n\n\n\nTO THE READER.\n\n\n       ’Tis strange to me, that they that love to tell\n    Things done of old, yea, and that do excel\n    Their equals in historiology,\n    Speak not of Mansoul’s wars, but let them lie\n    Dead, like old fables, or such worthless things,\n    That to the reader no advantage brings:\n    When men, let them make what they will their own,\n    Till they know this, are to themselves unknown.\n       Of stories, I well know, there’s divers sorts,\n    Some foreign, some domestic; and reports\n    Are thereof made as fancy leads the writers:\n    (By books a man may guess at the inditers.)\n    Some will again of that which never was,\n    Nor will be, feign (and that without a cause)\n    Such matter, raise such mountains, tell such things\n    Of men, of laws, of countries, and of kings;\n    And in their story seem to be so sage,\n    And with such gravity clothe every page,\n    That though their frontispiece says all is vain,\n    Yet to their way disciples they obtain.\n       But, readers, I have somewhat else to do,\n    Than with vain stories thus to trouble you.\n    What here I say, some men do know so well,\n    They can with tears and joy the story tell.\n       The town of Mansoul is well known to many,\n    Nor are her troubles doubted of by any\n    That are acquainted with those Histories\n    That Mansoul and her wars anatomize.\n       Then lend thine ear to what I do relate,\n    Touching the town of Mansoul and her state:\n    How she was lost, took captive, made a slave:\n    And how against him set, that should her save;\n    Yea, how by hostile ways she did oppose\n    Her Lord, and with his enemy did close.\n    For they are true: he that will them deny\n    Must needs the best of records vilify.\n    For my part, I myself was in the town,\n    Both when ’twas set up, and when pulling down.\n    I saw Diabolus in his possession,\n    And Mansoul also under his oppression.\n    Yea, I was there when she own’d him for lord,\n    And to him did submit with one accord.\n       When Mansoul trampled upon things divine,\n    And wallowed in filth as doth a swine;\n    When she betook herself unto her arms,\n    Fought her Emmanuel, despis’d his charms;\n    Then I was there, and did rejoice to see\n    Diabolus and Mansoul so agree.\n       Let no men, then, count me a fable-maker,\n    Nor make my name or credit a partaker\n    Of their derision: what is here in view,\n    Of mine own knowledge, I dare say is true.\n       I saw the Prince’s armed men come down\n    By troops, by thousands, to besiege the town;\n    I saw the captains, heard the trumpets sound,\n    And how his forces covered all the ground.\n    Yea, how they set themselves in battle-’ray,\n    I shall remember to my dying day.\n       I saw the colours waving in the wind,\n    And they within to mischief how combin’d\n    To ruin Mansoul, and to make away\n    Her primum mobile without delay.\n       I saw the mounts cast up against the town,\n    And how the slings were placed to beat it down:\n    I heard the stones fly whizzing by mine ears,\n    (What longer kept in mind than got in fears?)\n    I heard them fall, and saw what work they made.\n    And how old Mors did cover with his shade\n    The face of Mansoul; and I heard her cry,\n    ‘Woe worth the day, in dying I shall die!’\n       I saw the battering-rams, and how they play’d\n    To beat open Ear-gate; and I was afraid\n    Not only Ear-gate, but the very town\n    Would by those battering-rams be beaten down.\n    I saw the fights, and heard the captains shout,\n    And in each battle saw who faced about;\n    I saw who wounded were, and who were slain;\n    And who, when dead, would come to life again.\n       I heard the cries of those that wounded were,\n    (While others fought like men bereft of fear,)\n    And while the cry, ‘Kill, kill,’ was in mine ears,\n    The gutters ran, not so with blood as tears.\n       Indeed, the captains did not always fight,\n    But then they would molest us day and night;\n    Their cry, ‘Up, fall on, let us take the town,’\n    Kept us from sleeping, or from lying down.\n       I was there when the gates were broken ope,\n    And saw how Mansoul then was stripp’d of hope;\n    I saw the captains march into the town,\n    How there they fought, and did their foes cut down.\n       I heard the Prince bid Boanerges go\n    Up to the castle, and there seize his foe;\n    And saw him and his fellows bring him down,\n    In chains of great contempt quite through the town.\n       I saw Emmanuel, when he possess’d\n    His town of Mansoul; and how greatly blest\n    A town his gallant town of Mansoul was,\n    When she received his pardon, loved his laws.\n       When the Diabolonians were caught,\n    When tried, and when to execution brought,\n    Then I was there; yea, I was standing by\n    When Mansoul did the rebels crucify.\n       I also saw Mansoul clad all in white,\n    I heard her Prince call her his heart’s delight.\n    I saw him put upon her chains of gold,\n    And rings, and bracelets, goodly to behold.\n       What shall I say?  I heard the people’s cries,\n    And saw the Prince wipe tears from Mansoul’s eyes.\n    And heard the groans, and saw the joy of many:\n    Tell you of all, I neither will, nor can I.\n    But by what here I say, you well may see\n    That Mansoul’s matchless wars no fables be.\n       Mansoul, the desire of both princes was:\n    One keep his gain would, t’other gain his loss.\n    Diabolus would cry, ‘The town is mine!’\n    Emmanuel would plead a right divine\n    Unto his Mansoul: then to blows they go,\n    And Mansoul cries, ‘These wars will me undo.’\n       Mansoul! her wars seemed endless in her eyes;\n    She’s lost by one, becomes another’s prize:\n    And he again that lost her last would swear,\n    ‘Have her I will, or her in pieces tear.’\n       Mansoul! it was the very seat of war;\n    Wherefore her troubles greater were by far\n    Than only where the noise of war is heard,\n    Or where the shaking of a sword is fear’d;\n    Or only where small skirmishes are fought,\n    Or where the fancy fighteth with a thought.\n       She saw the swords of fighting men made red,\n    And heard the cries of those with them wounded:\n    Must not her frights, then, be much more by far\n    Than theirs that to such doings strangers are?\n    Or theirs that hear the beating of a drum,\n    But not made fly for fear from house and home?\n       Mansoul not only heard the trumpet’s sound,\n    But saw her gallants gasping on the ground:\n    Wherefore we must not think that she could rest\n    With them, whose greatest earnest is but jest:\n    Or where the blust’ring threat’ning of great wars\n    Do end in parlies, or in wording jars.\n    Mansoul! her mighty wars, they did portend\n    Her weal or woe, and that world without end:\n    Wherefore she must be more concern’d than they\n    Whose fears begin, and end the selfsame day;\n    Or where none other harm doth come to him\n    That is engaged, but loss of life or limb,\n    As all must needs confess that now do dwell\n    In Universe, and can this story tell.\n       Count me not, then, with them that, to amaze\n    The people, set them on the stars to gaze,\n    Insinuating with much confidence,\n    That each of them is now the residence\n    Of some brave creatures: yea, a world they will\n    Have in each star, though it be past their skill\n    To make it manifest to any man,\n    That reason hath, or tell his fingers can.\n       But I have too long held thee in the porch,\n    And kept thee from the sunshine with a torch,\n    Well, now go forward, step within the door,\n    And there behold five hundred times much more\n    Of all sorts of such inward rarities\n    As please the mind will, and will feed the eyes\n    With those, which, if a Christian, thou wilt see\n    Not small, but things of greatest moment be.\n       Nor do thou go to work without my key;\n    (In mysteries men soon do lose their way;)\n    And also turn it right, if thou wouldst know\n    My riddle, and wouldst with my heifer plough;\n    It lies there in the window.  Fare thee well,\n    My next may be to ring thy passing-bell.\n\n                                                              JOHN BUNYAN.\n\n\n\n\nAN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.\n\n\n       SOME say the ‘Pilgrim’s Progress’ is not mine,\n    Insinuating as if I would shine\n    In name and fame by the worth of another,\n    Like some made rich by robbing of their brother.\n    Or that so fond I am of being sire,\n    I’ll father bastards; or, if need require,\n    I’ll tell a lie in print to get applause.\n    I scorn it: John such dirt-heap never was,\n    Since God converted him.  Let this suffice\n    To show why I my ‘Pilgrim’ patronize.\n       It came from mine own heart, so to my head,\n    And thence into my fingers trickled;\n    Then to my pen, from whence immediately\n    On paper I did dribble it daintily.\n       Manner and matter, too, was all mine own,\n    Nor was it unto any mortal known\n    Till I had done it; nor did any then\n    By books, by wits, by tongues, or hand, or pen,\n    Add five words to it, or write half a line\n    Thereof: the whole, and every whit is mine.\n       Also for THIS, thine eye is now upon,\n    The matter in this manner came from none\n    But the same heart, and head, fingers, and pen,\n    As did the other.  Witness all good men;\n    For none in all the world, without a lie,\n    Can say that this is mine, excepting I\n       I write not this of my ostentation,\n    Nor ‘cause I seek of men their commendation;\n    I do it to keep them from such surmise,\n    As tempt them will my name to scandalize.\n    Witness my name, if anagram’d to thee,\n    The letters make—‘Nu hony in a B.’\n\n                                                              JOHN BUNYAN.\n\n\n\n\nA RELATION OF THE HOLY WAR.\n\n\nIN my travels, as I walked through many regions and countries, it was my\nchance to happen into that famous continent of Universe.  A very large\nand spacious country it is: it lieth between the two poles, and just\namidst the four points of the heavens.  It is a place well watered, and\nrichly adorned with hills and valleys, bravely situate, and for the most\npart, at least where I was, very fruitful, also well peopled, and a very\nsweet air.\n\nThe people are not all of one complexion, nor yet of one language, mode,\nor way of religion, but differ as much as, it is said, do the planets\nthemselves.  Some are right, and some are wrong, even as it happeneth to\nbe in lesser regions.\n\nIn this country, as I said, it was my lot to travel; and there travel I\ndid, and that so long, even till I learned much of their mother tongue,\ntogether with the customs and manners of them among whom I was.  And, to\nspeak truth, I was much delighted to see and hear many things which I saw\nand heard among them; yea, I had, to be sure, even lived and died a\nnative among them, (so was I taken with them and their doings,) had not\nmy master sent for me home to his house, there to do business for him,\nand to oversee business done.\n\nNow there is in this gallant country of Universe a fair and delicate\ntown, a corporation called Mansoul; a town for its building so curious,\nfor its situation so commodious, for its privileges so advantageous, (I\nmean with reference to its origin,) that I may say of it, as was said\nbefore of the continent in which it is placed, There is not its equal\nunder the whole heaven.\n\nAs to the situation of this town, it lieth just between the two worlds;\nand the first founder and builder of it, so far as by the best and most\nauthentic records I can gather, was one Shaddai; and he built it for his\nown delight.  He made it the mirror and glory of all that he made, even\nthe top-piece, beyond anything else that he did in that country.  Yea, so\ngoodly a town was Mansoul when first built, that it is said by some, the\ngods, at the setting up thereof, came down to see it, and sang for joy.\nAnd as he made it goodly to behold, so also mighty to have dominion over\nall the country round about.  Yea, all were commanded to acknowledge\nMansoul for their metropolitan, all were enjoined to do homage to it.\nAye, the town itself had positive commission and power from her King to\ndemand service of all, and also to subdue any that anyways denied to do\nit.\n\nThere was reared up in the midst of this town a most famous and stately\npalace; for strength, it might be called a castle; for pleasantness, a\nparadise; for largeness, a place so copious as to contain all the world.\nThis place the King Shaddai intended but for himself alone, and not\nanother with him; partly because of his own delights, and partly because\nhe would not that the terror of strangers should be upon the town.  This\nplace Shaddai made also a garrison of, but committed the keeping of it\nonly to the men of the town.\n\nThe walls of the town were well built, yea, so fast and firm were they\nknit and compact together, that, had it not been for the townsmen\nthemselves, they could not have been shaken or broken for ever.  For here\nlay the excellent wisdom of him that builded Mansoul, that the walls\ncould never be broken down nor hurt by the most mighty adverse potentate,\nunless the townsmen gave consent thereto.\n\nThis famous town of Mansoul had five gates, in at which to come, out at\nwhich to go; and these were made likewise answerable to the walls, to\nwit, impregnable, and such as could never be opened nor forced but by the\nwill and leave of those within.  The names of the gates were these:\nEar-gate, Eye-gate, Mouth-gate, Nose-gate, and Feel-gate.\n\nOther things there were that belonged to the town of Mansoul, which if\nyou adjoin to these, will yet give farther demonstration to all, of the\nglory and strength of the place.  It had always a sufficiency of\nprovision within its walls; it had the best, most wholesome, and\nexcellent law that then was extant in the world.  There was not a rascal,\nrogue, or traitorous person then within its walls; they were all true\nmen, and fast joined together; and this, you know, is a great matter.\nAnd to all these, it had always (so long as it had the goodness to keep\ntrue to Shaddai the King) his countenance, his protection, and it was his\ndelight, etc.\n\nWell, upon a time, there was one Diabolus, a mighty giant, made an\nassault upon this famous town of Mansoul, to take it, and make it his own\nhabitation.  This giant was king of the blacks, and a most raving prince\nhe was.  We will, if you please, first discourse of the origin of this\nDiabolus, and then of his taking of this famous town of Mansoul.\n\nThis Diabolus is indeed a great and mighty prince, and yet both poor and\nbeggarly.  As to his origin, he was at first one of the servants of King\nShaddai, made, and taken, and put by him into most high and mighty place;\nyea, was put into such principalities as belonged to the best of his\nterritories and dominions.  This Diabolus was made ‘son of the morning,’\nand a brave place he had of it: it brought him much glory, and gave him\nmuch brightness, an income that might have contented his Luciferian\nheart, had it not been insatiable, and enlarged as hell itself.\n\nWell, he seeing himself thus exalted to greatness and honour, and raging\nin his mind for higher state and degree, what doth he but begins to think\nwith himself how he might be set up as lord over all, and have the sole\npower under Shaddai.  (Now that did the King reserve for his Son, yea,\nand had already bestowed it upon him.)  Wherefore he first consults with\nhimself what had best to be done; and then breaks his mind to some other\nof his companions, to the which they also agreed.  So, in fine, they came\nto this issue that they should make an attempt upon the King’s Son to\ndestroy him, that the inheritance might be theirs.  Well, to be short,\nthe treason, as I said, was concluded, the time appointed, the word\ngiven, the rebels rendezvoused, and the assault attempted.  Now the King\nand his Son being all and always eye, could not but discern all passages\nin his dominions; and he, having always love for his Son as for himself,\ncould not at what he saw but be greatly provoked and offended: wherefore\nwhat does he, but takes them in the very nick and first trip that they\nmade towards their design, convicts them of the treason, horrid\nrebellion, and conspiracy that they had devised, and now attempted to put\ninto practice, and casts them altogether out of all place of trust,\nbenefit, honour, and preferment.  This done, he banishes them the court,\nturns them down into the horrible pits, as fast bound in chains, never\nmore to expect the least favour from his hands, but to abide the judgment\nthat he had appointed, and that for ever.\n\nNow they being thus cast out of all place of trust, profit, and honour,\nand also knowing that they had lost their prince’s favour for ever,\n(being banished his court, and cast down to the horrible pits,) you may\nhe sure they would now add to their former pride what malice and rage\nagainst Shaddai, and against his Son, they could.  Wherefore, roving and\nranging in much fury from place to place, if, perhaps, they might find\nsomething that was the King’s, by spoiling of that, to revenge themselves\non him; at last they happened into this spacious country of Universe, and\nsteer their course towards the town of Mansoul; and considering that that\ntown was one of the chief works and delights of King Shaddai, what do\nthey but, after counsel taken, make an assault upon that.  I say, they\nknew that Mansoul belonged unto Shaddai; for they were there when he\nbuilt it and beautified it for himself.  So when they had found the\nplace, they shouted horribly for joy, and roared on it as a lion upon the\nprey, saying, ‘Now we have found the prize, and how to be revenged on\nKing Shaddai for what he hath done to us.’  So they sat down and called a\ncouncil of war, and considered with themselves what ways and methods they\nhad best to engage in for the winning to themselves this famous town of\nMansoul, and these four things were then propounded to be considered of.\n\nFirst.  Whether they had best all of them to show themselves in this\ndesign to the town of Mansoul.\n\nSecondly.  Whether they had best to go and sit down against Mansoul in\ntheir now ragged and beggarly guise.\n\nThirdly.  Whether they had best show to Mansoul their intentions, and\nwhat design they came about, or whether to assault it with words and ways\nof deceit.\n\nFourthly.  Whether they had not best to some of their companions to give\nout private orders to take the advantage, if they see one or more of the\nprincipal townsmen, to shoot them, if thereby they shall judge their\ncause and design will the better be promoted.\n\n1. It was answered to the first of these proposals in the negative, to\nwit, that it would not be best that all should show themselves before the\ntown, because the appearance of many of them might alarm and frighten the\ntown; whereas a few or but one of them was not so likely to do it.  And\nto enforce this advice to take place it was added further, that if\nMansoul was frighted, or did take the alarm, ‘It is impossible,’ said\nDiabolus (for he spake now), ‘that we should take the town: for that none\ncan enter into it without its own consent.  Let, therefore, but few, or\nbut one, assault Mansoul; and in mine opinion,’ said Diabolus, ‘let me be\nhe.’  Wherefore to this they all agreed.\n\n2. And then to the second proposal they came, namely, Whether they had\nbest go and sit down before Mansoul in their now ragged and beggarly\nguise.  To which it was answered also in the negative, By no means; and\nthat because, though the town of Mansoul had been made to know, and to\nhave to do, before now, with things that are invisible, they did never as\nyet see any of their fellow-creatures in so sad and rascally condition as\nthey; and this was the advice of that fierce Alecto.  Then said Apollyon,\n‘The advice is pertinent; for even one of us appearing to them as we are\nnow, must needs both beget and multiply such thoughts in them as will\nboth put them into a consternation of spirit, and necessitate them to put\nthemselves upon their guard.  And if so,’ said he, ‘then, as my Lord\nDiabolus said but now, it is in vain for us to think of taking the town.’\nThen said that mighty giant Beelzebub, ‘The advice that already is given\nis safe; for though the men of Mansoul have seen such things as we once\nwere, yet hitherto they did never behold such things as we now are; and\nit is best, in mine opinion, to come upon them in such a guise as is\ncommon to, and most familiar among them.’  To this, when they had\nconsented, the next thing to be considered was, in what shape, hue, or\nguise Diabolus had best to show himself when he went about to make\nMansoul his own.  Then one said one thing, and another the contrary.  At\nlast Lucifer answered, that, in his opinion, it was best that his\nlordship should assume the body of some of those creatures that they of\nthe town had dominion over; ‘for,’ quoth he, ‘these are not only familiar\nto them, but, being under them, they will never imagine that an attempt\nshould by them be made upon the town; and, to blind all, let him assume\nthe body of one of those beasts that Mansoul deems to be wiser than any\nof the rest.’  This advice was applauded of all: so it was determined\nthat the giant Diabolus should assume the dragon, for that he was in\nthose days as familiar with the town of Mansoul as now is the bird with\nthe boy; for nothing that was in its primitive state was at all amazing\nto them.  Then they proceeded to the third thing, which was:\n\n3. Whether they had best to show their intentions, or the design of his\ncoming, to Mansoul, or no.  This also was answered in the negative,\nbecause of the weight that was in the former reasons, to wit, for that\nMansoul were a strong people, a strong people in a strong town, whose\nwall and gates were impregnable, (to say nothing of their castle,) nor\ncan they by any means be won but by their own consent.  ‘Besides,’ said\nLegion, (for he gave answer to this,) ‘a discovery of our intentions may\nmake them send to their king for aid; and if that be done, I know quickly\nwhat time of day it will be with us.  Therefore let us assault them in\nall pretended fairness, covering our intentions with all manner of lies,\nflatteries, delusive words; feigning things that never will be, and\npromising that to them that they shall never find.  This is the way to\nwin Mansoul, and to make them of themselves open their gates to us; yea,\nand to desire us too to come in to them.  And the reason why I think that\nthis project will do is, because the people of Mansoul now are, every\none, simple and innocent, all honest and true; nor do they as yet know\nwhat it is to be assaulted with fraud, guile, and hypocrisy.  They are\nstrangers to lying and dissembling lips; wherefore we cannot, if thus we\nbe disguised, by them at all be discerned; our lies shall go for true\nsayings, and our dissimulations for upright dealings.  What we promise\nthem they will in that believe us, especially if, in all our lies and\nfeigned words, we pretend great love to them, and that our design is only\ntheir advantage and honour.’  Now there was not one bit of a reply\nagainst this; this went as current down as doth the water down a steep\ndescent.  Wherefore they go to consider of the last proposal, which was:\n\n4. Whether they had not best to give out orders to some of their company\nto shoot some one or more of the principal of the townsmen, if they judge\nthat their cause may be promoted thereby.  This was carried in the\naffirmative, and the man that was designed by this stratagem to be\ndestroyed was one Mr. Resistance, otherwise called Captain Resistance.\nAnd a great man in Mansoul this Captain Resistance was, and a man that\nthe giant Diabolus and his band more feared than they feared the whole\ntown of Mansoul besides.  Now who should be the actor to do the murder?\nThat was the next, and they appointed one Tisiphone, a fury of the lake,\nto do it.\n\nThey thus having ended their council of war, rose up, and essayed to do\nas they had determined; they marched towards Mansoul, but all in a manner\ninvisible, save one, only one; nor did he approach the town in his own\nlikeness, but under the shade and in the body of the dragon.\n\nSo they drew up and sat down before Ear-gate, for that was the place of\nhearing for all without the town, as Eye-gate was the place of\nperspection.  So, as I said, he came up with his train to the gate, and\nlaid his ambuscado for Captain Resistance within bow-shot of the town.\nThis done, the giant ascended up close to the gate, and called to the\ntown of Mansoul for audience.  Nor took he any with him but one\nIll-pause, who was his orator in all difficult matters.  Now, as I said,\nhe being come up to the gate, (as the manner of those times was,) sounded\nhis trumpet for audience; at which the chief of the town of Mansoul, such\nas my Lord Innocent, my Lord Willbewill, my Lord Mayor, Mr. Recorder, and\nCaptain Resistance, came down to the wall to see who was there, and what\nwas the matter.  And my Lord Willbewill, when he had looked over and saw\nwho stood at the gate, demanded what he was, wherefore he was come, and\nwhy he roused the town of Mansoul with so unusual a sound.\n\nDiabolus, then, as if he had been a lamb, began his oration, and said:\n‘Gentlemen of the famous town of Mansoul, I am, as you may perceive, no\nfar dweller from you, but near, and one that is bound by the king to do\nyou my homage and what service I can; wherefore, that I may be faithful\nto myself and to you, I have somewhat of concern to impart unto you.\nWherefore, grant me your audience, and hear me patiently.  And first, I\nwill assure you, it is not myself, but you—not mine, but your advantage\nthat I seek by what I now do, as will full well be made manifest, by that\nI have opened my mind unto you.  For, gentlemen, I am (to tell you the\ntruth) come to show you how you may obtain great and ample deliverance\nfrom a bondage that, unawares to yourselves, you are captivated and\nenslaved under.’  At this the town of Mansoul began to prick up its ears.\nAnd ‘What is it?  Pray what is it?’ thought they.  And he said, ‘I have\nsomewhat to say to you concerning your King, concerning his law, and also\ntouching yourselves.  Touching your King, I know he is great and potent;\nbut yet all that he hath said to you is neither true nor yet for your\nadvantage.  1. It is not true, for that wherewith he hath hitherto awed\nyou, shall not come to pass, nor be fulfilled, though you do the thing\nthat he hath forbidden.  But if there was danger, what a slavery is it to\nlive always in fear of the greatest of punishments, for doing so small\nand trivial a thing as eating of a little fruit is.  2. Touching his\nlaws, this I say further, they are both unreasonable, intricate, and\nintolerable.  Unreasonable, as was hinted before; for that the punishment\nis not proportioned to the offence: there is great difference and\ndisproportion between the life and an apple; yet the one must go for the\nother by the law of your Shaddai.  But it is also intricate, in that he\nsaith, first, you may eat of all; and yet after forbids the eating of\none.  And then, in the last place, it must needs be intolerable,\nforasmuch as that fruit which you are forbidden to eat of (if you are\nforbidden any) is that, and that alone, which is able, by your eating, to\nminister to you a good as yet unknown by you.  This is manifest by the\nvery name of the tree; it is called the “tree of knowledge of good and\nevil;” and have you that knowledge as yet? No, no; nor can you conceive\nhow good, how pleasant, and how much to be desired to make one wise it\nis, so long as you stand by your King’s commandment.  Why should you be\nholden in ignorance and blindness?  Why should you not be enlarged in\nknowledge and understanding?  And now, O ye inhabitants of the famous\ntown of Mansoul, to speak more particularly to yourselves you are not a\nfree people!  You are kept both in bondage and slavery, and that by a\ngrievous threat; no reason being annexed but, “So I will have it; so it\nshall be.”  And is it not grievous to think on, that that very thing\nwhich you are forbidden to do might you but do it, would yield you both\nwisdom and honour? for then your eyes will be opened, and you shall be as\ngods.  Now, since this is thus,’ quoth he, ‘can you be kept by any prince\nin more slavery and in greater bondage than you are under this day?  You\nare made underlings, and are wrapped up in inconveniences, as I have well\nmade appear.  For what bondage greater than to be kept in blindness?\nWill not reason tell you that it is better to have eyes than to be\nwithout them? and so to be at liberty to be better than to be shut up in\na dark and stinking cave?’\n\nAnd just now, while Diabolus was speaking these words to Mansoul,\nTisiphone shot at Captain Resistance, where he stood on the gate, and\nmortally wounded him in the head; so that he, to the amazement of the\ntownsmen, and the encouragement of Diabolus, fell down dead quite over\nthe wall.  Now, when Captain Resistance was dead, (and he was the only\nman of war in the town,) poor Mansoul was wholly left naked of courage,\nnor had she now any heart to resist.  But this was as the devil would\nhave it.  Then stood forth he, Mr. Ill-pause, that Diabolus brought with\nhim, who was his orator; and he addressed himself to speak to the town of\nMansoul; the tenour of whose speech here follows:—\n\n‘Gentlemen,’ quoth he, ‘it is my master’s happiness that he has this day\na quiet and teachable auditory; and it is hoped by us that we shall\nprevail with you not to cast off good advice.  My master has a very great\nlove for you; and although, as he very well knows, that he runs the\nhazard of the anger of King Shaddai, yet love to you will make him do\nmore than that.  Nor doth there need that a word more should be spoken to\nconfirm for truth what he hath said; there is not a word but carries with\nit self-evidence in its bowels; the very name of the tree may put an end\nto all controversy in this matter.  I therefore, at this time, shall only\nadd this advice to you, under and by the leave of my lord;’ (and with\nthat he made Diabolus a very low congee;) ‘consider his words, look on\nthe tree and the promising fruit thereof; remember also that yet you know\nbut little, and that this is the way to know more: and if your reasons be\nnot conquered to accept of such good counsel, you are not the men that I\ntook you to be.’\n\nBut when the townsfolk saw that the tree was good for food, and that it\nwas pleasant to the eye, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, they\ndid as old Ill-pause advised; they took and did eat thereof.  Now this I\nshould have told you before, that even then, when this Ill-pause was\nmaking his speech to the townsmen, my Lord Innocency (whether by a shot\nfrom the camp of the giant, or from some sinking qualm that suddenly took\nhim, or whether by the stinking breath of that treacherous villain old\nIll-pause, for so I am most apt to think) sunk down in the place where he\nstood, nor could be brought to life again.  Thus these two brave men\ndied—brave men, I call them; for they were the beauty and glory of\nMansoul, so long as they lived therein; nor did there now remain any more\na noble spirit in Mansoul; they all fell down and yielded obedience to\nDiabolus; and became his slaves and vassals, as you shall hear.\n\nNow these being dead, what do the rest of the townsfolk, but, as men that\nhad found a fool’s paradise, they presently, as afore was hinted, fall to\nprove the truth of the giant’s words.  And, first, they did as Ill-pause\nhad taught them; they looked, they considered they were taken with the\nforbidden fruit; they took thereof, and did eat; and having eaten, they\nbecame immediately drunken therewith.  So they open the gate, both\nEar-gate and Eye-gate, and let in Diabolus with all his bands, quite\nforgetting their good Shaddai, his law, and the judgment that he had\nannexed, with solemn threatening, to the breach thereof.\n\nDiabolus, having now obtained entrance in at the gates of the town,\nmarches up to the middle thereof, to make his conquest as sure as he\ncould; and finding, by this time, the affections of the people warmly\ninclining to him, he, as thinking it was best striking while the iron is\nhot, made this further deceivable speech unto them, saying, ‘Alas, my\npoor Mansoul!  I have done thee indeed this service, as to promote thee\nto honour, and to greaten thy liberty; but, alas! alas! poor Mansoul,\nthou wantest now one to defend thee; for assure thyself that when Shaddai\nshall hear what is done, he will come; for sorry will he be that thou\nhast broken his bonds, and cast his cords away from thee.  What wilt thou\ndo?  Wilt thou, after enlargement, suffer thy privileges to be invaded\nand taken away, or what wilt resolve with thyself?’\n\nThen they all with one consent said to this bramble, ‘Do thou reign over\nus.’  So he accepted the motion, and became the king of the town of\nMansoul.  This being done, the next thing was to give him possession of\nthe castle, and so of the whole strength of the town.  Wherefore, into\nthe castle he goes; it was that which Shaddai built in Mansoul for his\nown delight and pleasure; this now was become a den and hold for the\ngiant Diabolus.\n\nNow, having got possession of this stately palace or castle, what doth he\nbut makes it a garrison for himself, and strengthens and fortifies it\nwith all sorts of provision, against the King Shaddai, or those that\nshould endeavour the regaining of it to him and his obedience again.\n\nThis done, but not thinking himself yet secure enough, in the next place\nhe bethinks himself of new modelling the town; and so he does, setting up\none, and putting down another at pleasure.  Wherefore my Lord Mayor,\nwhose name was my Lord Understanding, and Mr. Recorder, whose name was\nMr. Conscience, these he put out of place and power.\n\nAs for my Lord Mayor, though he was an understanding man, and one too\nthat had complied with the rest of the town of Mansoul in admitting the\ngiant into the town, yet Diabolus thought not fit to let him abide in his\nformer lustre and glory, because he was a seeing man.  Wherefore he\ndarkened him, not only by taking from him his office and power, but by\nbuilding a high and strong tower, just between the sun’s reflections and\nthe windows of my lord’s palace; by which means his house and all, and\nthe whole of his habitation, were made as dark as darkness itself.  And\nthus, being alienated from the light, he became as one that was born\nblind.  To this, his house, my lord was confined as to a prison; nor\nmight he, upon his parole, go farther than within his own bounds.  And\nnow, had he had a heart to do for Mansoul, what could he do for it, or\nwherein could he be profitable to her?  So then, so long as Mansoul was\nunder the power and government of Diabolus, (and so long it was under\nhim, as it was obedient to him, which was even until by a war it was\nrescued out of his hand,) so long my Lord Mayor was rather an impediment\nin, than an advantage to the famous town of Mansoul.\n\nAs for Mr. Recorder, before the town was taken, he was a man well read in\nthe laws of his king, and also a man of courage and faithfulness to speak\ntruth at every occasion; and he had a tongue as bravely hung as he had a\nhead filled with judgment.  Now, this man Diabolus could by no means\nabide, because, though he gave his consent to his coming into the town,\nyet he could not, by all the wiles, trials, stratagems, and devices that\nhe could use, make him wholly his own.  True, he was much degenerated\nfrom his former king, and also much pleased with many of the giant’s laws\nand service; but all this would not do, forasmuch as he was not wholly\nhis.  He would now and then think upon Shaddai, and have dread of his law\nupon him, and then he would speak against Diabolus with a voice as great\nas when a lion roareth.  Yea, and would also at certain times, when his\nfits were upon him, (for you must know that sometimes he had terrible\nfits,) make the whole town of Mansoul shake with his voice: and therefore\nthe now king of Mansoul could not abide him.\n\nDiabolus, therefore, feared the Recorder more than any that was left\nalive in the town of Mansoul, because, as I said, his words did shake the\nwhole town; they were like the rattling thunder, and also like\nthunder-claps.  Since, therefore, the giant could not make him wholly his\nown, what doth he do but studies all that he could to debauch the old\ngentleman, and by debauchery to stupefy his mind, and more harden his\nheart in the ways of vanity.  And as he attempted, so he accomplished his\ndesign: he debauched the man, and by little and little so drew him into\nsin and wickedness, that at last he was not only debauched, as at first,\nand so by consequence defiled, but was almost (at last, I say) past all\nconscience of sin.  And this was the farthest Diabolus could go.\nWherefore he bethinks him of another project, and that was, to persuade\nthe men of the town that Mr. Recorder was mad, and so not to be regarded.\nAnd for this he urged his fits, and said, ‘If he be himself, why doth he\nnot do thus always?  But,’ quoth he, ‘as all mad folks have their fits,\nand in them their raving language, so hath this old and doating\ngentleman.’\n\nThus, by one means or another, he quickly got Mansoul to slight, neglect,\nand despise whatever Mr. Recorder could say.  For, besides what already\nyou have heard, Diabolus had a way to make the old gentleman, when he was\nmerry, unsay and deny what he in his fits had affirmed.  And, indeed,\nthis was the next way to make himself ridiculous, and to cause that no\nman should regard him.  Also now he never spake freely for King Shaddai,\nbut also by force and constraint.  Besides, he would at one time be hot\nagainst that at which, at another, he would hold his peace; so uneven was\nhe now in his doings.  Sometimes he would be as if fast asleep, and again\nsometimes as dead, even then when the whole town of Mansoul was in her\ncareer after vanity, and in her dance after the giant’s pipe.\n\nWherefore, sometimes when Mansoul did use to be frighted with the\nthundering voice of the Recorder that was, and when they did tell\nDiabolus of it, he would answer, that what the old gentleman said was\nneither of love to him nor pity to them, but of a foolish fondness that\nhe had to be prating; and so would hush, still, and put all to quiet\nagain.  And that he might leave no argument unurged that might tend to\nmake them secure, he said, and said it often, ‘O Mansoul! consider that,\nnotwithstanding the old gentleman’s rage, and the rattle of his high and\nthundering words, you hear nothing of Shaddai himself;’ when, liar and\ndeceiver that he was, every outcry of Mr. Recorder against the sin of\nMansoul was the voice of God in him to them.  But he goes on, and says,\n‘You see that he values not the loss nor rebellion of the town of\nMansoul, nor will he trouble himself with calling his town to a reckoning\nfor their giving themselves to me.  He knows that though you were his,\nnow you are lawfully mine; so, leaving us one to another, he now hath\nshaken his hands of us.\n\n‘Moreover, O Mansoul!’ quoth he, ‘consider how I have served you, even to\nthe uttermost of my power; and that with the best that I have, could get,\nor procure for you in all the world: besides, I dare say that the laws\nand customs that you now are under, and by which you do homage to me, do\nyield you more solace and content than did the paradise that at first you\npossessed.  Your liberty also, as yourselves do very well know, has been\ngreatly widened and enlarged by me; whereas I found you a penned-up\npeople.  I have not laid any restraint upon you; you have no law,\nstatute, or judgment of mine to fright you; I call none of you to account\nfor your doings, except the madman—you know who I mean; I have granted\nyou to live, each man like a prince in his own, even with as little\ncontrol from me as I myself have from you.’\n\nAnd thus would Diabolus hush up and quiet the town of Mansoul, when the\nRecorder that was, did at times molest them: yea, and with such cursed\norations as these, would set the whole town in a rage and fury against\nthe old gentleman.  Yea, the rascal crew at some times would be for\ndestroying him.  They have often wished, in my hearing, that he had lived\na thousand miles off from them: his company, his words, yea, the sight of\nhim, and specially when they remembered how in old times he did use to\nthreaten and condemn them, (for all he was now so debauched,) did terrify\nand afflict them sore.\n\nBut all wishes were vain, for I do not know how, unless by the power of\nShaddai, and his wisdom, he was preserved in being amongst them.\nBesides, his house was as strong as a castle, and stood hard by a\nstronghold of the town: moreover, if at any time any of the crew or\nrabble attempted to make him away, he could pull up the sluices, and let\nin such floods as would drown all round about him.\n\nBut to leave Mr. Recorder, and to come to my Lord Willbewill, another of\nthe gentry of the famous town of Mansoul.  This Willbewill was as\nhigh-born as any man in Mansoul, and was as much, if not more, a\nfreeholder than many of them were; besides, if I remember my tale aright,\nhe had some privileges peculiar to himself in the famous town of Mansoul.\nNow, together with these, he was a man of great strength, resolution, and\ncourage, nor in his occasion could any turn him away.  But I say, whether\nhe was proud of his estate, privileges, strength, or what, (but sure it\nwas through pride of something,) he scorns now to be a slave in Mansoul;\nand therefore resolves to bear office under Diabolus, that he might (such\nan one as he was) be a petty ruler and governor in Mansoul.  And,\nheadstrong man that he was! thus he began betimes; for this man, when\nDiabolus did make his oration at Ear-gate, was one of the first that was\nfor consenting to his words, and for accepting his counsel at wholesome,\nand that was for the opening of the gate, and for letting him into the\ntown; wherefore Diabolus had a kindness for him, and therefore he\ndesigned for him a place.  And perceiving the valour and stoutness of the\nman, he coveted to have him for one of his great ones, to act and do in\nmatters of the highest concern.\n\nSo he sent for him, and talked with him of that secret matter that lay in\nhis breast, but there needed not much persuasion in the case.  For as at\nfirst he was willing that Diabolus should be let into the town, so now he\nwas as willing to serve him there.  When the tyrant, therefore, perceived\nthe willingness of my lord to serve him, and that his mind stood bending\nthat way, he forthwith made him the captain of the castle, governor of\nthe wall, and keeper of the gates of Mansoul: yea, there was a clause in\nhis commission, that nothing without him should be done in all the town\nof Mansoul.  So that now, next to Diabolus himself, who but my Lord\nWillbewill in all the town of Mansoul! nor could anything now be done,\nbut at his will and pleasure, throughout the town of Mansoul.  He had\nalso one Mr. Mind for his clerk, a man to speak on every way like his\nmaster: for he and his lord were in principle one, and in practice not\nfar asunder.  And now was Mansoul brought under to purpose, and made to\nfulfil the lusts of the will, and of the mind.\n\nBut it will not out of my thoughts what a desperate one this Willbewill\nwas when power was put into his hand.  First, he flatly denied that he\nowed any suit or service to his former prince and liege lord.  This done,\nin the next place he took an oath, and swore fidelity to his great master\nDiabolus, and then, being stated and settled in his places, offices,\nadvancements, and preferments, oh! you cannot think, unless you had seen\nit, the strange work that this workman made in the town of Mansoul.\n\nFirst, he maligned Mr. Recorder to death; he would neither endure to see\nhim, nor hear the words of his mouth; he would shut his eyes when he saw\nhim, and stop his ears when he heard him speak.  Also he could not endure\nthat so much as a fragment of the law of Shaddai should be anywhere seen\nin the town.  For example, his clerk, Mr. Mind, had some old, rent, and\ntorn parchments of the law of Shaddai in his house, but when Willbewill\nsaw them, he cast them behind his back.  True, Mr. Recorder had some of\nthe laws in his study; but my lord could by no means come at them.  He\nalso thought and said, that the windows of my old Lord Mayor’s house were\nalways too light for the profit of the town of Mansoul.  The light of a\ncandle he could not endure.  Now nothing at all pleased Willbewill but\nwhat pleased Diabolus his lord.\n\nThere was none like him to trumpet about the streets the brave nature,\nthe wise conduct, and great glory of the king Diabolus.  He would range\nand rove throughout all the streets of Mansoul to cry up his illustrious\nlord, and would make himself even as an abject, among the base and rascal\ncrew, to cry up his valiant prince.  And I say, when and wheresoever he\nfound these vassals, he would even make himself as one of them.  In all\nill courses he would act without bidding, and do mischief without\ncommandment.\n\nThe Lord Willbewill also had a deputy under him, and his name was Mr.\nAffection, one that was also greatly debauched in his principles, and\nanswerable thereto in his life: he was wholly given to the flesh, and\ntherefore they called him Vile-Affection.  Now there was he and one\nCarnal-Lust, the daughter of Mr. Mind, (like to like,) that fell in love,\nand made a match, and were married; and, as I take it, they had several\nchildren, as Impudent, Blackmouth, and Hate-Reproof.  These three were\nblack boys.  And besides these they had three daughters, as Scorn-Truth\nand Slight-God, and the name of the youngest was Revenge.  These were all\nmarried in the town, and also begot and yielded many bad brats, too many\nto be here inserted.  But to pass by this.\n\nWhen the giant had thus engarrisoned himself in the town of Mansoul, and\nhad put down and set up whom he thought good, he betakes himself to\ndefacing.  Now there was in the market-place in Mansoul, and also upon\nthe gates of the castle, an image of the blessed King Shaddai.  This\nimage was so exactly engraven, (and it was engraven in gold,) that it did\nthe most resemble Shaddai himself of anything that then was extant in the\nworld.  This he basely commanded to be defaced, and it was as basely done\nby the hand of Mr. No-Truth.  Now you must know that, as Diabolus had\ncommanded, and that by the hand of Mr. No-Truth, the image of Shaddai was\ndefaced, he likewise gave order that the same Mr. No-Truth should set up\nin its stead the horrid and formidable image of Diabolus, to the great\ncontempt of the former King, and debasing of his town of Mansoul.\n\nMoreover, Diabolus made havoc of all remains of the laws and statutes of\nShaddai that could be found in the town of Mansoul; to wit, such as\ncontained either the doctrines of morals, with all civil and natural\ndocuments.  Also relative severities he sought to extinguish.  To be\nshort, there was nothing of the remains of good in Mansoul which he and\nWillbewill sought not to destroy; for their design was to turn Mansoul\ninto a brute, and to make it like to the sensual sow, by the hand of Mr.\nNo-Truth.\n\nWhen he had destroyed what law and good orders he could, then further to\neffect his design, namely, to alienate Mansoul from Shaddai her King, he\ncommands, and they set up his own vain edicts, statutes, and\ncommandments, in all places of resort or concourse in Mansoul, to wit,\nsuch as gave liberty to the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eyes,\nand the pride of life, which are not of Shaddai, but of the world.  He\nencouraged, countenanced, and promoted lasciviousness, and all\nungodliness there.  Yea, much more did Diabolus to encourage wickedness\nin the town of Mansoul; he promised them peace, content, joy, and bliss,\nin doing his commands, and that they should never be called to an account\nfor their not doing the contrary.  And let this serve to give a taste to\nthem that love to hear tell of what is done beyond their knowledge afar\noff in other countries.\n\nNow Mansoul being wholly at his beck, and brought wholly to his bow,\nnothing was heard or seen therein but that which tended to set up him.\n\nBut now he, having disabled the Lord Mayor and Mr. Recorder from bearing\nof office in Mansoul, and seeing that the town, before he came to it, was\nthe most ancient of corporations in the world, and fearing, if he did not\nmaintain greatness, they at any time should object that he had done them\nan injury; therefore, I say, (that they might see that he did not intend\nto lessen their grandeur, or to take from them any of their advantageous\nthings,) he did choose for them a Lord Mayor and a Recorder himself, and\nsuch as contented them at the heart, and such also as pleased him\nwondrous well.\n\nThe name of the Mayor that was of Diabolus’ making was the Lord Lustings,\na man that had neither eyes nor ears.  All that he did, whether as a man\nor an officer, he did it naturally, as doth the beast.  And that which\nmade him yet the more ignoble, though not to Mansoul, yet to them that\nbeheld and were grieved for its ruin, was, that he never could favour\ngood, but evil.\n\nThe Recorder was one whose name was Forget-Good, and a very sorry fellow\nhe was.  He could remember nothing but mischief, and to do it with\ndelight.  He was naturally prone to do things that were hurtful, even\nhurtful to the town of Mansoul, and to all the dwellers there.  These\ntwo, therefore, by their power and practice, examples, and smiles upon\nevil, did much more grammar and settle the common people in hurtful ways.\nFor who doth not perceive that when those that sit aloft are vile and\ncorrupt themselves, they corrupt the whole region and country where they\nare?\n\nBesides these, Diabolus made several burgesses and aldermen in Mansoul,\nsuch as out of whom the town, when it needed, might choose them officers,\ngovernors, and magistrates.  And these are the names of the chief of\nthem: Mr. Incredulity, Mr. Haughty, Mr. Swearing, Mr. Whoring, Mr.\nHard-Heart, Mr. Pitiless, Mr. Fury, Mr. No-Truth, Mr. Stand-to-Lies, Mr.\nFalse-Peace, Mr. Drunkenness, Mr. Cheating, Mr. Atheism—thirteen in all.\nMr. Incredulity is the eldest, and Mr. Atheism the youngest of the\ncompany.\n\nThere was also an election of common councilmen and others, as bailiffs,\nsergeants, constables, and others; but all of them like to those\nafore-named, being either fathers, brothers, cousins, or nephews to them,\nwhose names, for brevity’s sake, I omit to mention.\n\nWhen the giant had thus far proceeded in his work, in the next place, he\nbetook him to build some strongholds in the town, and he built three that\nseemed to be impregnable.  The first he called the Hold of Defiance,\nbecause it was made to command the whole town, and to keep it from the\nknowledge of its ancient King.  The second he called Midnight Hold,\nbecause it was built on purpose to keep Mansoul from the true knowledge\nof itself.  The third was called Sweet-Sin Hold, because by that he\nfortified Mansoul against all desires of good.  The first of these holds\nstood close by Eye-gate, that, as much might be, light might be darkened\nthere; the second was built hard by the old castle, to the end that that\nmight be made more blind, if possible; and the third stood in the\nmarket-place.\n\nHe that Diabolus made governor over the first of these was one Spite-God,\na most blasphemous wretch: he came with the whole rabble of them that\ncame against Mansoul at first, and was himself one of themselves.  He\nthat was made the governor of Midnight Hold was one Love-no-Light; he was\nalso of them that came first against the town.  And he that was made the\ngovernor of the hold called Sweet-Sin Hold was one whose name was\nLove-Flesh: he was also a very lewd fellow, but not of that country where\nthe other are bound.  This fellow could find more sweetness when he stood\nsucking of a lust than he did in all the paradise of God.\n\nAnd now Diabolus thought himself safe.  He had taken Mansoul, he had\nengarrisoned himself therein; he had put down the old officers, and had\nset up new ones; he had defaced the image of Shaddai, and had set up his\nown; he had spoiled the old law books, and had promoted his own vain\nlies; he had made him new magistrates, and set up new aldermen; he had\nbuilded him new holds, and had manned them for himself: and all this he\ndid to make himself secure, in case the good Shaddai, or his Son, should\ncome to make an incursion upon him.\n\nNow you may well think, that long before this time, word, by some one or\nother, could not but be carried to the good King Shaddai, how his\nMansoul, in the continent of Universe, was lost; and that the runagate\ngiant Diabolus, once one of his Majesty’s servants, had, in rebellion\nagainst the King, made sure thereof for himself.  Yea, tidings were\ncarried and brought to the King thereof, and that to a very circumstance.\n\nAt first, how Diabolus came upon Mansoul (they being a simple people and\ninnocent) with craft, subtlety, lies, and guile.  _Item_, that he had\ntreacherously slain the right noble and valiant captain, their Captain\nResistance, as he stood upon the gate with the rest of the townsmen.\n_Item_, how my brave Lord Innocent fell down dead (with grief, some say,\nor with being poisoned with the stinking breath of one Ill-Pause, as say\nothers) at the hearing of his just lord and rightful prince, Shaddai, so\nabused by the mouth of so filthy a Diabolian as that varlet Ill-Pause\nwas.  The messenger further told, that after this Ill-Pause had made a\nshort oration to the townsmen in behalf of Diabolus, his master; the\nsimple town, believing that what was said was true, with one consent did\nopen Ear-gate, the chief gate of the corporation, and did let him, with\nhis crew, into a possession of the famous town of Mansoul.  He further\nshowed how Diabolus had served the Lord Mayor and Mr. Recorder, to wit,\nthat he had put them from all place of power and trust.  _Item_, he\nshowed also that my Lord Willbewill was turned a very rebel, and\nrunagate, and that so was one Mr. Mind, his clerk; and that they two did\nrange and revel it all the town over, and teach the wicked ones their\nways.  He said, moreover, that this Willbewill was put into great trust,\nand particularly that Diabolus had put into Willbewill’s hand all the\nstrong places in Mansoul; and that Mr. Affection was made my Lord\nWillbewill’s deputy in his most rebellious affairs.  ‘Yea,’ said the\nmessenger, ‘this monster, Lord Willbewill, has openly disavowed his King\nShaddai, and hath horribly given his faith and plighted his troth to\nDiabolus.’\n\n‘Also,’ said the messenger, ‘besides all this, the new king, or rather\nrebellious tyrant, over the once famous, but now perishing town of\nMansoul, has set up a Lord Mayor and a Recorder of his own.  For Mayor,\nhe has set up one Mr. Lustings; and for Recorder, Mr. Forget-Good; two of\nthe vilest of all the town of Mansoul.’  This faithful messenger also\nproceeded, and told what a sort of new burgesses Diabolus had made; also\nthat he had built several strong forts, towers, and strongholds in\nMansoul.  He told, too, the which I had almost forgot, how Diabolus had\nput the town of Mansoul into arms, the better to capacitate them, on his\nbehalf, to make resistance against Shaddai their King, should he come to\nreduce them to their former obedience.\n\nNow this tidings-teller did not deliver his relation of things in\nprivate, but in open court, the King and his Son, high lords, chief\ncaptains, and nobles, being all there present to hear.  But by that they\nhad heard the whole of the story, it would have amazed one to have seen,\nhad he been there to behold it, what sorrow and grief, and compunction of\nspirit, there was among all sorts, to think that famous Mansoul was now\ntaken: only the King and his Son foresaw all this long before, yea, and\nsufficiently provided for the relief of Mansoul, though they told not\neverybody thereof.  Yet because they also would have a share in condoling\nof the Misery of Mansoul, therefore they also did, and that at a rate of\nthe highest degree, bewail the losing of Mansoul.  The King said plainly\nthat it grieved him at the heart, and you may be sure that his Son was\nnot a whit behind him.  Thus gave they conviction to all about them that\nthey had love and compassion for the famous town of Mansoul.  Well, when\nthe King and his Son were retired into the privy chamber, there they\nagain consulted about what they had designed before, to wit, that as\nMansoul should in time be suffered to be lost, so as certainly it should\nbe recovered again; recovered, I say, in such a way, as that both the\nKing and his Son would get themselves eternal fame and glory thereby.\nWherefore, after this consult, the Son of Shaddai (a sweet and comely\nPerson, and one that had always great affection for those that were in\naffliction, but one that had mortal enmity in his heart against Diabolus,\nbecause he was designed for it, and because he sought his crown and\ndignity)—this Son of Shaddai, I say, having stricken hands with his\nFather and promised that he would be his servant to recover his Mansoul\nagain, stood by his resolution, nor would he repent of the same.  The\npurport of which agreement was this: to wit, that at a certain time,\nprefixed by both, the King’s Son should take a journey into the country\nof Universe, and there, in a way of justice and equity, by making amends\nfor the follies of Mansoul, he should lay a foundation of perfect\ndeliverance from Diabolus and from his tyranny.\n\nMoreover Emmanuel resolved to make, at a time convenient, a war upon the\ngiant Diabolus, even while he was possessed of the town of Mansoul; and\nthat he would fairly by strength of hand drive him out of his hold, his\nnest, and take it to himself to be his habitation.\n\nThis now being resolved upon, order was given to the Lord Chief Secretary\nto draw up a fair record of what was determined, and to cause that it\nshould be published in all the corners of the kingdom of Universe.  A\nshort breviate of the contents thereof you may, if you please, take here\nas follows:\n\n‘Let all men know who are concerned, that the Son of Shaddai, the great\nKing, is engaged by covenant to his Father to bring his Mansoul to him\nagain; yea, and to put Mansoul, too, through the power of his matchless\nlove, into a far better and more happy condition than it was in before it\nwas taken by Diabolus.’\n\nThese papers, therefore, were published in several places, to the no\nlittle molestation of the tyrant Diabolus; ‘for now,’ thought he, ‘I\nshall be molested, and my habitation will be taken from me.’\n\nBut when this matter, I mean this purpose of the King and his Son, did at\nfirst take air at court, who can tell how the high lords, chief captains,\nand noble princes that were there, were taken with the business!  First,\nthey whispered it one to another, and after that it began to ring out\nthrough the King’s palace, all wondering at the glorious design that\nbetween the King and his Son was on foot for the miserable town of\nMansoul.  Yea, the courtiers could scarce do anything either for the King\nor kingdom, but they would mix, with the doing thereof, a noise of the\nlove of the King and his Son, that they had for the town of Mansoul.\n\nNor could these lords, high captains, and princes be content to keep this\nnews at court; yea, before the records thereof were perfected, themselves\ncame down and told it in Universe.  At last it came to the ears, as I\nsaid, of Diabolus, to his no little discontent; for you must think it\nwould perplex him to hear of such a design against him.  Well, but after\na few casts in his mind, he concluded upon these four things.\n\nFirst, that this news, these good tidings, (if possible,) should be kept\nfrom the ears of the town of Mansoul; ‘for,’ said he, ‘if they should\nonce come to the knowledge that Shaddai, their former King, and Emmanuel\nhis Son, are contriving good for the town of Mansoul, what can be\nexpected by me, but that Mansoul will make a revolt from under my hand\nand government, and return again to him?’\n\nNow, to accomplish this his design, he renews his flattery with my Lord\nWillbewill, and also gives him strict charge and command, that he should\nkeep watch by day and by night at all the gates of the town, especially\nEar-gate and Eye-gate; ‘for I hear of a design,’ quoth he, ‘a design to\nmake us all traitors, and that Mansoul must be reduced to its first\nbondage again.  I hope they are but flying stories,’ quoth he; ‘however,\nlet no such news by any means be let into Mansoul, lest the people be\ndejected thereat.  I think, my lord, it can be no welcome news to you; I\nam sure it is none to me; and I think that, at this time, it should be\nall our wisdom and care to nip the head of all such rumours as shall tend\nto trouble our people.  Wherefore I desire, my lord, that you will in\nthis matter do as I say.  Let there be strong guards daily kept at every\ngate of the town.  Stop also and examine from whence such come that you\nperceive do from far come hither to trade, nor let them by any means be\nadmitted into Mansoul, unless you shall plainly perceive that they are\nfavourers of our excellent government.  I command, moreover,’ said\nDiabolus, ‘that there be spies continually walking up and down the town\nof Mansoul, and let them have power to suppress and destroy any that they\nshall perceive to be plotting against us, or that shall prate of what by\nShaddai and Emmanuel is intended.’\n\nThis, therefore, was accordingly done; my Lord Willbewill hearkened to\nhis lord and master, went willingly after the commandment, and, with all\nthe diligence he could, kept any that would from going out abroad, or\nthat sought to bring these tidings to Mansoul, from coming into the town.\n\nSecondly, this done, in the next place, Diabolus, that he might make\nMansoul as sure as he could, frames and imposes a new oath and horrible\ncovenant upon the townsfolk:—To wit, that they should never desert him\nnor his government, nor yet betray him, nor seek to alter his laws; but\nthat they should own, confess, stand by, and acknowledge him for their\nrightful king, in defiance to any that do or hereafter shall, by any\npretence, law, or title whatever, lay claim to the town of Mansoul;\nthinking, belike, that Shaddai had not power to absolve them from this\ncovenant with death, and agreement with hell.  Nor did the silly Mansoul\nstick or boggle at all at this most monstrous engagement; but, as if it\nhad been a sprat in the mouth of a whale, they swallowed it without any\nchewing.  Were they troubled at all?  Nay, they rather bragged and\nboasted of their so brave fidelity to the tyrant, their pretended king,\nswearing that they would never be changelings, nor forsake their old lord\nfor a new.  Thus did Diabolus tie poor Mansoul fast.\n\nThirdly.  But jealousy, that never thinks itself strong enough, put him,\nin the next place, upon another exploit, which was, yet more, if\npossible, to debauch this town of Mansoul.  Wherefore he caused, by the\nhand of one Mr. Filth, an odious, nasty, lascivious piece of beastliness\nto be drawn up in writing, and to be set upon the castle gates; whereby\nhe granted and gave license to all his true and trusty sons in Mansoul to\ndo whatsoever their lustful appetites prompted them to do; and that no\nman was to let, hinder, or control them, upon pain of incurring the\ndispleasure of their prince.\n\nNow this he did for these reasons:—\n\n1. That the town of Mansoul might be yet made weaker and weaker, and so\nmore unable, should tidings come that their redemption was designed, to\nbelieve, hope, or consent to the truth thereof; for reason says, The\nbigger the sinner, the less grounds of hopes of mercy.\n\n2. The second reason was, if perhaps Emmanuel, the Son of Shaddai their\nKing, by seeing the horrible and profane doings of the town of Mansoul,\nmight repent, though entered into a covenant of redeeming them, of\npursuing that covenant of their redemption; for he knew that Shaddai was\nholy, and that his Son Emmanuel was holy; yea, he knew it by woeful\nexperience, for for his iniquity and sin was Diabolus cast from the\nhighest orbs.  Wherefore what more rational than for him to conclude that\nthus, for sin, it might fare with Mansoul?  But fearing also lest this\nknot should break, he bethinks himself of another, to wit:—\n\nFourthly.  To endeavour to possess all hearts in the town of Mansoul that\nShaddai was raising an army, to come to overthrow and utterly to destroy\nthis town of Mansoul.  And this he did to forestall any tidings that\nmight come to their ears of their deliverance: ‘For,’ thought he, ‘if I\nfirst bruit this, the tidings that shall come after will all be swallowed\nup of this; for what else will Mansoul say, when they shall hear that\nthey must be delivered, but that the true meaning is, Shaddai intends to\ndestroy them?  Wherefore he summons the whole town into the market-place,\nand there, with deceitful tongue, thus he addressed himself unto them:—\n\n‘Gentlemen, and my very good friends, you are all, as you know, my legal\nsubjects, and men of the famous town of Mansoul.  You know how, from the\nfirst day that I have been with you until now, I have behaved myself\namong you, and what liberty and great privileges you have enjoyed under\nmy government, I hope to your honour and mine, and also to your content\nand delight.  Now, my famous Mansoul, a noise of trouble there is abroad,\nof trouble to the town of Mansoul; sorry I am thereof for your sakes: for\nI received but now by the post from my Lord Lucifer, (and he useth to\nhave good intelligence,) that your old King Shaddai is raising an army to\ncome against you, to destroy you root and branch; and this, O Mansoul, is\nnow the cause that at this time I have called you together, namely, to\nadvise what in this juncture is best to be done.  For my part, I am but\none, and can with ease shift for myself, did I list to seek my own case,\nand to leave my Mansoul in all the danger; but my heart is so firmly\nunited to you, and so unwilling am I to leave you, that I am willing to\nstand and fall with you, to the utmost hazard that shall befall me.  What\nsay you, O my Mansoul?  Will you now desert your old friend, or do you\nthink of standing by me?’\n\nThen, as one man, with one mouth, they cried out together, ‘Let him die\nthe death that will not.’\n\nThen said Diabolus again, ‘It is in vain for us to hope for quarter, for\nthis King knows not how to show it.  True, perhaps, he, at his first\nsitting down before us, will talk of and pretend to mercy, that thereby,\nwith the more ease, and less trouble, he may again make himself the\nmaster of Mansoul.  Whatever, therefore, he shall say, believe not one\nsyllable or tittle of it; for all such language is but to overcome us,\nand to make us, while we wallow in our blood, the trophies of his\nmerciless victory.  My mind is, therefore, that we resolve to the last\nman to resist him, and not to believe him upon any terms, for in at that\ndoor will come our danger.  But shall we be flattered out of our lives?\nI hope you know more of the rudiments of politics than to suffer\nyourselves so pitifully to be served.\n\n‘But suppose he should, if he get us to yield, save some of our lives, or\nthe lives of some of them that are underlings in Mansoul, what help will\nthat be to you that are the chief of the town, especially you whom I have\nset up and whose greatness has been procured by you through your faithful\nsticking to me?  And suppose, again, that he should give quarter to every\none of you, be sure he will bring you into that bondage under which you\nwere captivated before, or a worse, and then what good will your lives do\nyou?  Shall you with him live in pleasure as you do now?  No, no; you\nmust be bound by laws that will pinch you, and be made to do that which\nat present is hateful to you.  I am for you, if you are for me; and it is\nbetter to die valiantly than to live like pitiful slaves.  But, I say,\nthe life of a slave will be counted a life too good for Mansoul now.\nBlood, blood, nothing but blood is in every blast of Shaddai’s trumpet\nagainst poor Mansoul now.  Pray, be concerned; I hear he is coming.  Up,\nand stand to your arms that now, while you have any leisure, I may learn\nyou some feats of war.  Armour for you I have, and by me it is; yea, and\nit is sufficient for Mansoul from top to toe; nor can you be hurt by what\nhis force can do, if you shall keep it well girt and fastened about you.\nCome, therefore, to my castle, and welcome, and harness yourselves for\nthe war.  There is helmet, breastplate, sword, and shield, and what not,\nthat will make you fight like men.\n\n‘1. My helmet, otherwise called an head-piece, is in hope of doing well\nat last, what lives soever you live.  This is that which they had who\nsaid, that they should have peace, though they walked in the wickedness\nof their heart, to add drunkenness to thirst.  A piece of approved armour\nthis is, and whoever has it, and can hold it, so long no arrow, dart,\nsword, or shield can hurt him.  This, therefore, keep on, and thou wilt\nkeep off many a blow, my Mansoul.\n\n‘2. My breastplate is a breastplate of iron.  I had it forged in mine own\ncountry, and all my soldiers are armed therewith.  In plain language, it\nis a hard heart, a heart as hard as iron, and as much past feeling as a\nstone; the which if you get and keep, neither mercy shall win you, nor\njudgment fright you.  This therefore, is a piece of armour most necessary\nfor all to put on that hate Shaddai, and that would fight against him\nunder my banner.\n\n‘3. My sword is a tongue that is set on fire of hell, and that can bend\nitself to speak evil of Shaddai, his Son, his ways, and people.  Use\nthis; it has been tried a thousand times twice told.  Whoever hath it,\nkeeps it, and makes that use of it as I would have him, can never be\nconquered by mine enemy.\n\n‘4. My, shield is unbelief, or calling into question the truth of the\nword, or all the sayings that speak of the judgment that Shaddai has\nappointed for wicked men.  Use this shield; many attempts he has made\nupon it, and sometimes, it is true, it has been bruised; but they that\nhave writ of the wars of Emmanuel against my servants, have testified\nthat he could do no mighty work there because of their unbelief.  Now, to\nhandle this weapon of mine aright, it is not to believe things because\nthey are true, of what sort or by whomsoever asserted.  If he speaks of\njudgment, care not for it; if he speaks of mercy, care not for it; if he\npromises, if he swears that he would do to Mansoul, if it turns, no hurt,\nbut good, regard not what is said, question the truth of all, for it is\nto wield the shield of unbelief aright, and as my servants ought and do;\nand he that doth otherwise loves me not, nor do I count him but an enemy\nto me.\n\n‘5. Another part or piece,’ said Diabolus, ‘of mine excellent armour is a\ndumb and prayerless spirit, a spirit that scorns to cry for mercy:\nwherefore be you, my Mansoul, sure that you make use of this.  What! cry\nfor quarter!  Never do that, if you would be mine.  I know you are stout\nmen, and am sure that I have clad you with that which is armour of proof.\nWherefore, to cry to Shaddai for mercy, let that be far from you.\nBesides all this, I have a maul, firebrands, arrows, and death, all good\nhand-weapons, and such as will do execution.’\n\nAfter he had thus furnished his men with armour and arms, he addressed\nhimself to them in such like words as these: ‘Remember,’ quoth he, ‘that\nI am your rightful king, and that you have taken an oath and entered into\ncovenant to be true to me and my cause: I say, remember this, and show\nyourselves stout and valiant men of Mansoul.  Remember also the kindness\nthat I have always showed to you, and that without your petition I have\ngranted to you external things; wherefore the privileges, grants,\nimmunities, profits, and honours wherewith I have endowed you do call\nfor, at your hands, returns of loyalty, my lion-like men of Mansoul: and\nwhen so fit a time to show it as when another shall seek to take my\ndominion over you into his own hands?  One word more, and I have done.\nCan we but stand, and overcome this one shock or brunt, I doubt not but\nin little time all the world will be ours; and when that day comes, my\ntrue hearts, I will make you kings, princes, and captains, and what brave\ndays shall we have then!’\n\nDiabolus having thus armed and forearmed his servants and vassals in\nMansoul against their good and lawful King Shaddai, in the next place, he\ndoubleth his guards at the gates of the town, and he takes himself to the\ncastle, which was his stronghold.  His vassals also, to show their wills,\nand supposed (but ignoble) gallantry, exercise themselves in their arms\nevery day, and teach one another feats of war; they also defied their\nenemies, and sang up the praises of their tyrant; they threatened also\nwhat men they would be if ever things should rise so high as a war\nbetween Shaddai and their king.\n\nNow all this time the good King, the King Shaddai, was preparing to send\nan army to recover the town of Mansoul again from under the tyranny of\ntheir pretended king Diabolus; but he thought good, at first, not to send\nthem by the hand and conduct of brave Emmanuel his Son, but under the\nhand of some of his servants, to see first by them the temper of Mansoul,\nand whether by them they would be won to the obedience of their King.\nThe army consisted of above forty thousand, all true men, for they came\nfrom the King’s own court, and were those of his own choosing.\n\nThey came up to Mansoul under the conduct of four stout generals, each\nman being a captain of ten thousand men, and these are their names and\ntheir ensigns.  The name of the first was Boanerges, the name of the\nsecond was Captain Conviction, the name of the third was Captain\nJudgment, and the name of the fourth was Captain Execution.  These were\nthe captains that Shaddai sent to regain Mansoul.\n\nThese four captains, as was said, the King thought fit, in the first\nplace, to send to Mansoul, to make an attempt upon it; for indeed\ngenerally in all his wars he did use to send these four captains in the\nvan, for they were very stout and rough-hewn men, men that were fit to\nbreak the ice, and to make their way by dint of sword, and their men were\nlike themselves.\n\nTo each of these captains the King gave a banner, that it might be\ndisplayed, because of the goodness of his cause, and because of the right\nthat he had to Mansoul.\n\nFirst, to Captain Boanerges, for he was the chief, to him, I say, were\ngiven ten thousand men.  His ensign was Mr. Thunder; he bare the black\ncolours, and his scutcheon was the three burning thunderbolts.\n\nThe second captain was Captain Conviction; to him also were given ten\nthousand men.  His ensign’s name was Mr. Sorrow; he did bear the pale\ncolours, and his scutcheon was the book of the law wide open, from whence\nissued a flame of fire.\n\nThe third captain was Captain Judgment; to him were given ten thousand\nmen.  His ensign’s name was Mr. Terror; he bare the red colours, and his\nscutcheon was a burning fiery furnace.\n\nThe fourth captain was Captain Execution; to him were given ten thousand\nmen.  His ensign was one Mr. Justice; he also bare the red colours, and\nhis scutcheon was a fruitless tree, with an axe lying at the root\nthereof.\n\nThese four captains, as I said, had every one of them under his command\nten thousand men, all of good fidelity to the King, and stout at their\nmilitary actions.\n\nWell, the captains and their forces, their men and under officers, being\nhad upon a day by Shaddai into the field, and there called all over by\ntheir names, were then and there put into such harness as became their\ndegree and that service which now they were going about for their King.\n\nNow, when the King had mustered his forces, (for it is he that mustereth\nthe host to the battle,) he gave unto the captains their several\ncommissions, with charge and commandment in the audience of all the\nsoldiers, that they should take heed faithfully and courageously to do\nand execute the same.  Their commissions were, for the substance of them,\nthe same in form, though, as to name, title, place and degree of the\ncaptains, there might be some, but very small variation.  And here let me\ngive you an account of the matter and sum contained in their commission.\n\n    _A Commission from the great Shaddai_, _King of Mansoul_, _to his\n    trusty and noble Captain_, _the Captain Boanerges_, _for his making\n    War upon the town of Mansoul_.\n\n    ‘O, thou Boanerges, one of my stout and thundering captains over one\n    ten thousand of my valiant and faithful servants, go thou in my name,\n    with this thy force, to the miserable town of Mansoul; and when thou\n    comest thither, offer them first conditions of peace; and command\n    them that, casting off the yoke and tyranny of the wicked Diabolus,\n    they return to me, their rightful Prince and Lord.  Command them also\n    that they cleanse themselves from all that is his in the town of\n    Mansoul, and look to thyself, that thou hast good satisfaction\n    touching the truth of their obedience.  Thus when thou hast commanded\n    them, (if they in truth submit thereto,) then do thou, to the\n    uttermost of thy power, what in thee lies to set up for me a garrison\n    in the famous town of Mansoul; nor do thou hurt the least native that\n    moveth or breatheth therein, if they will submit themselves to me,\n    but treat thou such as if they were thy friend or brother; for all\n    such I love, and they shall be dear unto me, and tell them that I\n    will take a time to come unto them, and to let them know that I am\n    merciful.\n\n    ‘But if they shall, notwithstanding thy summons and the producing of\n    thy authority, resist, stand out against thee, and rebel, then do I\n    command thee to make use of all thy cunning, power, might, and force,\n    to bring them under by strength of hand.  Farewell.’\n\nThus you see the sum of their commissions; for, as I said before, for the\nsubstance of them, they were the same that the rest of the noble captains\nhad.\n\nWherefore they, having received each commander his authority at the hand\nof their King, the day being appointed, and the place of their rendezvous\nprefixed, each commander appeared in such gallantry as became his cause\nand calling.  So, after a new entertainment from Shaddai, with flying\ncolours they set forward to march towards the famous town of Mansoul.\nCaptain Boanerges led the van, Captain Conviction and Captain Judgment\nmade up the main body, and Captain Execution brought up the rear.  They\nthen, having a great way to go, (for the town of Mansoul was far off from\nthe court of Shaddai,) marched through the regions and countries of many\npeople, not hurting or abusing any, but blessing wherever they came.\nThey also lived upon the King’s cost in all the way they went.\n\nHaving travelled thus for many days, at last they came within sight of\nMansoul; the which when they saw, the captains could for their hearts do\nno less than for a while bewail the condition of the town; for they\nquickly saw how that it was prostrate to the will of Diabolus, and to his\nways and designs.\n\nWell, to be short, the captains came up before the town, march up to\nEar-gate, sit down there (for that was the place of hearing).  So, when\nthey had pitched their tents and entrenched themselves, they addressed\nthemselves to make their assault.\n\nNow the townsfolk at first, beholding so gallant a company, so bravely\naccoutred, and so excellently disciplined, having on their glittering\narmour, and displaying of their flying colours, could not but come out of\ntheir houses and gaze.  But the cunning fox Diabolus, fearing that the\npeople, after this sight, should, on a sudden summons, open the gates to\nthe captains, came down with all haste from the castle, and made them\nretire into the body of the town, who, when he had them there, made this\nlying and deceivable speech unto them:\n\n‘Gentlemen,’ quoth he, ‘although you are my trusty and well-beloved\nfriends, yet I cannot but a little chide you for your late uncircumspect\naction, in going out to gaze on that great and mighty force that but\nyesterday sat down before, and have now entrenched themselves in order to\nthe maintaining of a siege against the famous town of Mansoul.  Do you\nknow who they are, whence they come, and what is their purpose in sitting\ndown before the town of Mansoul?  They are they of whom I have told you\nlong ago, that they would come to destroy this town, and against whom I\nhave been at the cost to arm you with _cap-a-pie_ for your body, besides\ngreat fortifications for your mind.  Wherefore, then, did you not rather,\neven at the first appearance of them, cry out, “Fire the beacons!” and\ngive the whole town an alarm concerning them, that we might all have been\nin a posture of defence, and been ready to have received them with the\nhighest acts of defiance?  Then had you showed yourselves men to my\nliking; whereas, by what you have done, you have made me half afraid—I\nsay, half afraid—that when they and we shall come to push a pike, I shall\nfind you want courage to stand it out any longer.  Wherefore have I\ncommanded a watch, and that you should double your guards at the gates?\nWherefore have I endeavoured to make you as hard as iron, and your hearts\nas a piece of the nether millstone?  Was it, think you, that you might\nshow yourselves women, and that you might go out like a company of\ninnocents to gaze on your mortal foes?  Fie, fie! put yourselves into a\nposture of defence, beat up the drum, gather together in warlike manner,\nthat our foes may know that, before they shall conquer this corporation,\nthere are valiant men in the town of Mansoul.\n\n‘I will leave off now to chide, and will not further rebuke you; but I\ncharge you, that henceforwards you let me see no more such actions.  Let\nnot henceforward a man of you, without order first obtained from me, so\nmuch as show his head over the wall of the town of Mansoul.  You have now\nheard me; do as I have commanded, and you shall cause me that I dwell\nsecurely with you, and that I take care, as for myself, so for your\nsafety and honour also.  Farewell.’\n\nNow were the townsmen strangely altered; they were as men stricken with a\npanic fear; they ran to and fro through the streets of the town of\nMansoul, crying out, ‘Help, help! the men that turn the world upside down\nare come hither also.’  Nor could any of them be quiet after; but still,\nas men bereft of wit, they cried out, ‘The destroyers of our peace and\npeople are come.’  This went down with Diabolus.  ‘Ah,’ quoth he to\nhimself, ‘this I like well: now it is as I would have it; now you show\nyour obedience to your prince.  Hold you but here, and then let them take\nthe town if they can.’\n\nWell, before the King’s forces had sat before Mansoul three days, Captain\nBoanerges commanded his trumpeter to go down to Ear-gate, and there, in\nthe name of the great Shaddai, to summon Mansoul to give audience to the\nmessage that he, in his Master’s name, was to them commanded to deliver.\nSo the trumpeter, whose name was Take-heed-what-you-hear, went up, as he\nwas commanded, to Ear-gate, and there sounded his trumpet for a hearing;\nbut there was none that appeared that gave answer or regard, for so had\nDiabolus commanded.  So the trumpeter returned to his captain, and told\nhim what he had done, and also how he had sped; whereat the captain was\ngrieved, but bid the trumpeter go to his tent.\n\nAgain Captain Boanerges sendeth his trumpeter to Ear-gate, to sound as\nbefore for a hearing; but they again kept close, came not out, nor would\nthey give him an answer, so observant were they of the command of\nDiabolus their king.\n\nThen the captains and other field officers called a council of war, to\nconsider what further was to be done for the gaining of the town of\nMansoul; and, after some close and thorough debate upon the contents of\ntheir commissions, they concluded yet to give to the town, by the hand of\nthe fore-named trumpeter, another summons to hear; but if that shall be\nrefused, said they, and that the town shall stand it out still, then they\ndetermined, and bid the trumpeter tell them so, that they would\nendeavour, by what means they could, to compel them by force to the\nobedience of their King.\n\nSo Captain Boanerges commanded his trumpeter to go up to Ear-gate again,\nand, in the name of the great King Shaddai, to give it a very loud\nsummons to come down without delay to Ear-gate, there to give audience to\nthe King’s most noble captains.  So the trumpeter went, and did as he was\ncommanded: he went up to Ear-gate, and sounded his trumpet, and gave a\nthird summons to Mansoul.  He said, moreover, that if this they should\nstill refuse to do, the captains of his prince would with might come down\nupon them, and endeavour to reduce them to their obedience by force.\n\nThen stood up my Lord Willbewill, who was the governor of the town, (this\nWillbewill was that apostate of whom mention was made before,) and the\nkeeper of the gates of Mansoul.  He therefore, with big and ruffling\nwords, demanded of the trumpeter who he was, whence he came, and what was\nthe cause of his making so hideous a noise at the gate, and speaking such\ninsufferable words against the town of Mansoul.\n\nThe trumpeter answered, ‘I am servant to the most noble captain, Captain\nBoanerges, general of the forces of the great King Shaddai, against whom\nboth thyself, with the whole town of Mansoul, have rebelled, and lift up\nthe heel; and my master, the captain, hath a special message to this\ntown, and to thee, as a member thereof; the which if you of Mansoul shall\npeaceably hear, so; and if not, you must take what follows.’\n\nThen said the Lord Willbewill, ‘I will carry thy words to my lord, and\nwill know what he will say.’\n\nBut the trumpeter soon replied, saying.  ‘Our message is not to the giant\nDiabolus, but to the miserable town of Mansoul; nor shall we at all\nregard what answer by him is made, nor yet by any for him.  We are sent\nto this town to recover it from under his cruel tyranny, and to persuade\nit to submit, as in former times it did, to the most excellent King\nShaddai.’\n\nThen said the Lord Willbewill, ‘I will do your errand to the town.’\n\nThe trumpeter then replied, ‘Sir, do not deceive us, lest, in so doing,\nyou deceive yourselves much more.’  He added, moreover, ‘For we are\nresolved, if in peaceable manner you do not submit yourselves, then to\nmake a war upon you, and to bring you under by force.  And of the truth\nof what I now say, this shall be a sign unto you,—you shall see the black\nflag, with its hot, burning thunder-bolts, set upon the mount to-morrow,\nas a token of defiance against your prince, and of our resolutions to\nreduce you to your Lord and rightful King.’\n\nSo the said Lord Willbewill returned from off the wall, and the trumpeter\ncame into the camp.  When the trumpeter was come into the camp, the\ncaptains and officers of the mighty King Shaddai came together to know if\nhe had obtained a hearing, and what was the effect of his errand.  So the\ntrumpeter told, saying, ‘When I had sounded my trumpet, and had called\naloud to the town for a hearing, my Lord Willbewill, the governor of the\ntown, and he that hath charge of the gates, came up when he heard me\nsound, and, looking over the wall, he asked me what I was, whence I came,\nand what was the cause of my making this noise.  So I told him my errand,\nand by whose authority I brought it.  “Then,” said he, “I will tell it to\nthe governor and to Mansoul;” and then I returned to my lords.’\n\nThen said the brave Boanerges, ‘Let us yet for a while lie still in our\ntrenches, and see what these rebels will do.’\n\nNow when the time drew nigh that audience by Mansoul must be given to the\nbrave Boanerges and his companions, it was commanded that all the men of\nwar throughout the whole camp of Shaddai should as one man stand to their\narms, and make themselves ready, if the town of Mansoul shall hear, to\nreceive it forthwith to mercy; but if not, to force a subjection.  So the\nday being come, the trumpeters sounded, and that throughout the whole\ncamp, that the men of war might be in a readiness for that which then\nshould be the work of the day.  But when they that were in the town of\nMansoul heard the sound of the trumpets throughout the camp of Shaddai,\nand thinking no other but that it must be in order to storm the\ncorporation, they at first were put to great consternation of spirit; but\nafter they a little were settled again, they also made what preparation\nthey could for a war, if they did storm; else, to secure themselves.\n\nWell, when the utmost time was come, Boanerges was resolved to hear their\nanswer; wherefore he sent out his trumpeter again to summon Mansoul to a\nhearing of the message that they had brought from Shaddai.\n\nSo he went and sounded, and the townsmen came up, but made Ear-gate as\nsure as they could.  Now when they were come up to the top of the wall,\nCaptain Boanerges desired to see the Lord Mayor; but my Lord Incredulity\nwas then Lord Mayor, for he came in the room of my Lord Lustings.  So\nIncredulity came up and showed himself over the wall; but when the\nCaptain Boanerges had set his eyes upon him, he cried out aloud, ‘This is\nnot he: where is my Lord Understanding, the ancient Lord Mayor of the\ntown of Mansoul? for to him I would deliver my message.’\n\nThen said the giant (for Diabolus was also come down) to the captain,\n‘Mr. Captain, you have by your boldness given to Mansoul at least four\nsummonses to subject herself to your King, by whose authority I know not,\nnor will I dispute that now.  I ask, therefore, what is the reason of all\nthis ado, or what would you be at if you knew yourselves?’\n\nThen Captain Boanerges, whose were the black colours, and whose scutcheon\nwas the three burning thunderbolts, taking no notice of the giant or of\nhis speech, thus addressed himself to the town of Mansoul: ‘Be it known\nunto you, O unhappy and rebellious Mansoul, that the most gracious King,\nthe great King Shaddai, my Master, hath sent me unto you with commission’\n(and so he showed to the town his broad seal) ‘to reduce you to his\nobedience; and he hath commanded me, in case you yield upon my summons,\nto carry it to you as if you were my friends or brethren; but he also\nhath bid, that if, after summons to submit you still stand out and rebel,\nwe should endeavour to take you by force.’\n\nThen stood forth Captain Conviction, and said, (his were the pale\ncolours, and for a scutcheon he had the book of the law wide open, etc.,)\n‘Hear, O Mansoul!  Thou, O Mansoul, wast once famous for innocency, but\nnow thou art degenerated into lies and deceit.  Thou hast heard what my\nbrother, the Captain Boanerges, hath said; and it is your wisdom, and\nwill be your happiness, to stoop to, and accept of conditions of peace\nand mercy when offered, specially when offered by one against whom thou\nhast rebelled, and one who is of power to tear thee in pieces, for so is\nShaddai, our King; nor, when he is angry, can anything stand before him.\nIf you say you have not sinned, or acted rebellion against our King, the\nwhole of your doings since the day that you cast off his service (and\nthere was the beginning of your sin) will sufficiently testify against\nyou.  What else means your hearkening to the tyrant, and your receiving\nhim for your king?  What means else your rejecting of the laws of\nShaddai, and your obeying of Diabolus?  Yea, what means this your taking\nup of arms against, and the shutting of your gates upon us, the faithful\nservants of your King?  Be ruled then, and accept of my brother’s\ninvitation, and overstand not the time of mercy, but agree with thine\nadversary quickly.  Ah, Mansoul! suffer not thyself to be kept from\nmercy, and to be run into a thousand miseries, by the flattering wiles of\nDiabolus.  Perhaps that piece of deceit may attempt to make you believe\nthat we seek our own profit in this our service, but know it is obedience\nto our King, and love to your happiness, that is the cause of this\nundertaking of ours.\n\n‘Again I say to thee, O Mansoul, consider if it be not amazing grace that\nShaddai should so humble himself as he doth: now he, by us, reasons with\nyou, in a way of entreaty and sweet persuasions, that you would subject\nyourselves to him.  Has he that need of you that we are sure you have of\nhim?  No, no; but he is merciful, and will not that Mansoul should die,\nbut turn to him and live.’\n\nThen stood forth Captain Judgment, whose were the red colours, and for a\nscutcheon he had the burning fiery furnace, and he said, ‘O ye, the\ninhabitants of the town of Mansoul, that have lived so long in rebellion\nand acts of treason against the King Shaddai, know that we come not\nto-day to this place, in this manner, with our message of our own minds,\nor to revenge our own quarrel; it is the King, my Master, that hath sent\nus to reduce you to your obedience to him; the which if you refuse in a\npeaceable way to yield, we have commission to compel you thereto.  And\nnever think of yourselves, nor yet suffer the tyrant Diabolus to persuade\nyou to think, that our King, by his power, is not able to bring you down,\nand to lay you under his feet; for he is the former of all things, and if\nhe touches the mountains, they smoke.  Nor will the gate of the King’s\nclemency stand always open; for the day that shall burn like an oven is\nbefore him; yea, it hasteth greatly, it slumbereth not.\n\n‘O Mansoul, is it little in thine eyes that our King doth offer thee\nmercy, and that after so many provocations?  Yea, he still holdeth out\nhis golden sceptre to thee, and will not yet suffer his gate to be shut\nagainst thee: wilt thou provoke him to do it?  If so, consider of what I\nsay; to thee it is opened no more for ever.  If thou sayest thou shalt\nnot see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.\nYea, because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his\nstroke; then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.  Will he esteem thy\nriches?  No, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.  He hath prepared\nhis throne for judgment, for he will come with fire, and with his\nchariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebukes\nwith flames of fire.  Therefore, O Mansoul, take heed lest, after thou\nhast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked, justice and judgment should\ntake hold of thee.’\n\nNow while the Captain Judgment was making this oration to the town of\nMansoul, it was observed by some that Diabolus trembled; but he proceeded\nin his parable and said, ‘O thou woful town of Mansoul, wilt thou not yet\nset open thy gate to receive us, the deputies of thy King, and those that\nwould rejoice to see thee live?  Can thine heart endure, or can thy hands\nbe strong, in the day that he shall deal in judgment with thee?  I say,\ncanst thou endure to be forced to drink, as one would drink sweet wine,\nthe sea of wrath that our King has prepared for Diabolus and his angels?\nConsider, betimes consider.’\n\nThen stood forth the fourth captain, the noble Captain Execution, and\nsaid, ‘O town of Mansoul, once famous, but now like the fruitless bough,\nonce the delight of the high ones, but now a den for Diabolus, hearken\nalso to me, and to the words that I shall speak to thee in the name of\nthe great Shaddai.  Behold, the axe is laid to the root of the trees:\nevery tree, therefore, that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down\nand cast into the fire.\n\n‘Thou, O town of Mansoul, hast hitherto been this fruitless tree; thou\nbearest nought but thorns and briars.  Thy evil fruit bespeaks thee not\nto be a good tree; thy grapes are grapes of gall, thy clusters are\nbitter.  Thou hast rebelled against thy King; and, lo! we, the power and\nforce of Shaddai, are the axe that is laid to thy root.  What sayest\nthou?  Wilt thou turn?  I say again, tell me, before the first blow is\ngiven, wilt thou turn?  Our axe must first be laid _to_ thy root before\nit be laid _at_ thy root; it must first be laid _to_ thy root in a way of\nthreatening, before it is laid _at_ thy root by way of execution; and\nbetween these two is required thy repentance, and this is all the time\nthat thou hast.  What wilt thou do?  Wilt thou turn, or shall I smite?\nIf I fetch my blow, Mansoul, down you go; for I have commission to lay my\naxe _at_ as well as _to_ thy roots, nor will anything but yielding to our\nKing prevent doing of execution.  What art thou fit for, O Mansoul, if\nmercy preventeth not, but to be hewn down, and cast into the fire and\nburned?\n\n‘O Mansoul, patience and forbearance do not act for ever: a year, or two,\nor three, they may; but if thou provoke by a three years’ rebellion, (and\nthou hast already done more than this,) then what follows but, ‘Cut it\ndown’? nay, ‘After that thou shalt cut it down.’  And dost thou think\nthat these are but threatenings, or that our King has not power to\nexecute his words?  O Mansoul, thou wilt find that in the words of our\nKing, when they are by sinners made little or light of, there is not only\nthreatening, but burning coals of fire.\n\n‘Thou hast been a cumber-ground long already, and wilt thou continue so\nstill?  Thy sin has brought this army to thy walls, and shall it bring it\nin judgment to do execution into thy town?  Thou hast heard what the\ncaptains have said, but as yet thou shuttest thy gates.  Speak out,\nMansoul; wilt thou do so still, or wilt thou accept of conditions of\npeace?’\n\nThese brave speeches of these four noble captains the town of Mansoul\nrefused to hear; yet a sound thereof did beat against Ear-gate, though\nthe force thereof could not break it open.  In fine, the town desired a\ntime to prepare their answer to these demands.  The captains then told\nthem, that if they would throw out to them one Ill-Pause that was in the\ntown, that they might reward him according to his works, then they would\ngive them time to consider; but if they would not cast him to them over\nthe wall of Mansoul, then they would give them none; ‘for,’ said they,\n‘we know that, so long as Ill-Pause draws breath in Mansoul, all good\nconsideration will be confounded, and nothing but mischief will come\nthereon.’\n\nThen Diabolus, who was there present, being loath to lose his Ill-Pause,\nbecause he was his orator, (and yet be sure he had, could the captains\nhave laid their fingers on him,) was resolved at this instant to give\nthem answer by himself; but then changing his mind, he commanded the then\nLord Mayor, the Lord Incredulity, to do it, saying, ‘My lord, do you give\nthese runagates an answer, and speak out, that Mansoul may hear and\nunderstand you.’\n\nSo Incredulity, at Diabolus’ command, began, and said, ‘Gentlemen, you\nhave here, as we do behold, to the disturbance of our prince and the\nmolestation of the town of Mansoul, camped against it: but from whence\nyou come, we will not know; and what you are, we will not believe.\nIndeed, you tell us in your terrible speech that you have this authority\nfrom Shaddai, but by what right he commands you to do it, of that we\nshall yet be ignorant.\n\n‘You have also, by the authority aforesaid, summoned this town to desert\nher lord, and, for protection, to yield up herself to the great Shaddai,\nyour King; flatteringly telling her, that if she will do it, he will pass\nby and not charge her with her past offences.\n\n‘Further, you have also, to the terror of the town of Mansoul, threatened\nwith great and sore destructions to punish this corporation, if she\nconsents not to do as your wills would have her.\n\n‘Now, captains, from whencesoever you come, and though your designs be\never so right, yet know ye that neither my Lord Diabolus, nor I, his\nservant, Incredulity, nor yet our brave Mansoul, doth regard either your\npersons, message, or the King that you say hath sent you.  His power, his\ngreatness, his vengeance, we fear not; nor will we yield at all to your\nsummons.\n\n‘As for the war that you threaten to make upon us, we must therein defend\nourselves as well as we can; and know ye, that we are not without\nwherewithal to bid defiance to you; and, in short, (for I will not be\ntedious,) I tell you, that we take you to be some vagabond runagate crew,\nthat having shaken off all obedience to your King, have gotten together\nin tumultuous manner, and are ranging from place to place to see if,\nthrough the flatteries you are skilled to make on the one side, and\nthreats wherewith you think to fright on the other, to make some silly\ntown, city, or country, desert their place, and leave it to you; but\nMansoul is none of them.\n\n‘To conclude: we dread you not, we fear you not, nor will we obey your\nsummons.  Our gates we will shut upon you, our place we will keep you out\nof.  Nor will we long thus suffer you to sit down before us: our people\nmust live in quiet: your appearance doth disturb them.  Wherefore arise\nwith bag and baggage, and begone, or we will let fly from the walls\nagainst you.’\n\nThis oration, made by old Incredulity, was seconded by desperate\nWillbewill, in words to this effect: ‘Gentlemen, we have heard your\ndemands, and the noise of your threats, and have heard the sound of your\nsummons; but we fear not your force, we regard not your threats, but will\nstill abide as you found us.  And we command you, that in three days’\ntime you cease to appear in these parts, or you shall know what it is\nonce to dare offer to rouse the lion Diabolus when asleep in his town of\nMansoul.’\n\nThe Recorder, whose name was Forget-Good, he also added as followeth:\n‘Gentlemen, my lords, as you see, have with mild and gentle words\nanswered your rough and angry speeches: they have, moreover, in my\nhearing, given you leave quietly to depart as you came; wherefore, take\ntheir kindness and be gone.  We might have come out with force upon you,\nand have caused you to feel the dint of our swords; but as we love ease\nand quiet ourselves, so we love not to hurt or molest others.’\n\nThen did the town of Mansoul shout for joy, as if by Diabolus and his\ncrew some great advantage had been gotten of the captains.  They also\nrang the bells, and made merry, and danced upon the walls.\n\nDiabolus also returned to the castle, and the Lord Mayor and Recorder to\ntheir place; but the Lord Willbewill took special care that the gates\nshould be secured with double guards, double bolts, and double locks and\nbars; and that Ear-gate especially might the better be looked to, for\nthat was the gate in at which the King’s forces sought most to enter.\nThe Lord Willbewill made one old Mr. Prejudice, an angry and\nill-conditioned fellow, captain of the ward at that gate, and put under\nhis power sixty men, called deaf men; men advantageous for that service,\nforasmuch as they mattered no words of the captains, nor of the soldiers.\n\nNow when the captains saw the answer of the great ones, and that they\ncould not get a hearing from the old natives of the town, and that\nMansoul was resolved to give the King’s army battle, they prepared\nthemselves to receive them, and to try it out by the power of the arm.\nAnd, first, they made their force more formidable against Ear-gate; for\nthey knew that, unless they could penetrate that, no good could be done\nupon the town.  This done, they put the rest of their men in their\nplaces; after which, they gave out the word, which was, ‘YE MUST BE BORN\nAGAIN.’  Then they sounded the trumpet; then they in the town made them\nanswer, with shout against shout, charge against charge, and so the\nbattle began.  Now they in the town had planted upon the tower over\nEar-gate two great guns, the one called High-mind, and the other Heady.\nUnto these two guns they trusted much; they were cast in the castle by\nDiabolus’ founder, whose name was Mr. Puff-up, and mischievous pieces\nthey were.  But so vigilant and watchful, when the captains saw them,\nwere they, that though sometimes their shot would go by their ears with a\nwhiz, yet they did them no harm.  By these two guns the townsfolk made no\nquestion but greatly to annoy the camp of Shaddai, and well enough to\nsecure the gate; but they had not much cause to boast of what execution\nthey did, as by what follows will be gathered.\n\nThe famous Mansoul had also some other small pieces in it, of the which\nthey made use against the camp of Shaddai.\n\nThey from the camp also did as stoutly, and with as much of that as may\nin truth be called valour, let fly as fast at the town and at Ear-gate;\nfor they saw that, unless they could break open Ear-gate, it would be but\nin vain to batter the wall.  Now the King’s captains had brought with\nthem several slings, and two or three battering-rams; with their slings,\ntherefore, they battered the houses and people of the town, and with\ntheir rams they sought to break Ear-gate open.\n\nThe camp and the town had several skirmishes and brisk encounters, while\nthe captains with their engines made many brave attempts to break open or\nbeat down the tower that was over Ear-gate, and at the said gate to make\ntheir entrance; but Mansoul stood it out so lustily, through the rage of\nDiabolus, the valour of the Lord Willbewill, and the conduct of old\nIncredulity, the Mayor, and Mr. Forget-Good, the Recorder, that the\ncharge and expense of that summer’s wars, on the King’s side, seemed to\nbe almost quite lost, and the advantage to return to Mansoul.  But when\nthe captains saw how it was they made a fair retreat, and entrenched\nthemselves in their winter quarters.  Now, in this war, you must needs\nthink there was much loss on both sides, of which be pleased to accept of\nthis brief account following.\n\nThe King’s captains, when they marched from the court to come up against\nMansoul to war, as they came crossing over the country, they happened to\nlight upon three young fellows that had a mind to go for soldiers: proper\nmen they were, and men of courage and skill, to appearance.  Their names\nwere Mr. Tradition, Mr. Human-Wisdom, and Mr. Man’s-Invention.  So they\ncame up to the captains, and proffered their service to Shaddai.  The\ncaptains then told them of their design, and bid them not to be rash in\ntheir offers; but the young men told them they had considered the thing\nbefore, and that hearing they were upon their march for such a design,\ncame hither on purpose to meet them, that they might be listed under\ntheir excellencies.  Then Captain Boanerges, for that they were men of\ncourage, listed them into his company, and so away they went to the war.\n\nNow, when the war was begun, in one of the briskest skirmishes, so it\nwas, that a company of the Lord Willbewill’s men sallied out at the\nsallyport or postern of the town, and fell in upon the rear of Captain\nBoanerges’ men, where these three fellows happened to be; so they took\nthem prisoners, and away they carried them into the town, where they had\nnot lain long in durance, but it began to be noised about the streets of\nthe town what three notable prisoners the Lord Willbewill’s men had\ntaken, and brought in prisoners out of the camp of Shaddai.  At length\ntidings thereof were carried to Diabolus to the castle, to wit what my\nLord Willbewill’s men had done, and whom they had taken prisoners.\n\nThen Diabolus called for Willbewill, to know the certainty of this\nmatter.  So he asked him, and he told him.  Then did the giant send for\nthe prisoners, and, when they were come, demanded of them who they were,\nwhence they came, and what they did in the camp of Shaddai; and they told\nhim.  Then he sent them to ward again.  Not many days after, he sent for\nthem to him again, and then asked them if they would be willing to serve\nhim against their former captains.  They then told him that they did not\nso much live by religion as by the fates of fortune; and that since his\nlordship was willing to entertain them, they should be willing to serve\nhim.  Now while things were thus in hand, there was one Captain Anything,\na great doer, in the town of Mansoul; and to this Captain Anything did\nDiabolus send these men, and a note under his hand, to receive them into\nhis company, the contents of which letter were thus:\n\n‘Anything, my darling,—The three men that are the bearers of this letter\nhave a desire to serve me in the war; nor know I better to whose conduct\nto commit them than to thine.  Receive them, therefore, in my name, and,\nas need shall require, make use of them against Shaddai and his men.\nFarewell.’\n\nSo they came, and he received them; and he made of two of them sergeants;\nbut he made Mr. Man’s-Invention his ancient-bearer.  But thus much for\nthis, and now to return to the camp.\n\nThey of the camp did also some execution upon the town; for they did beat\ndown the roof of the Lord Mayor’s house, and so laid him more open than\nhe was before.  They had almost, with a sling, slain my Lord Willbewill\noutright; but he made a shift to recover again.  But they made a notable\nslaughter among the aldermen, for with one only shot they cut off six of\nthem; to wit, Mr. Swearing, Mr. Whoring, Mr. Fury, Mr. Stand-to-Lies, Mr.\nDrunkenness, and Mr. Cheating.\n\nThey also dismounted the two guns that stood upon the tower over\nEar-gate, and laid them flat in the dirt.  I told you before that the\nKing’s noble captains had drawn off to their winter quarters, and had\nthere entrenched themselves and their carriages, so as with the best\nadvantage to their King, and the greatest annoyance to the enemy, they\nmight give seasonable and warm alarms to the town of Mansoul.  And this\ndesign of them did so hit, that I may say they did almost what they would\nto the molestation of the corporation.  For now could not Mansoul sleep\nsecurely as before, nor could they now go to their debaucheries with that\nquietness as in times past; for they had from the camp of Shaddai such\nfrequent, warm, and terrifying alarms, yea, alarms upon alarms, first at\none gate and then at another, and again at all the gates at once, that\nthey were broken as to former peace.  Yea, they had their alarms so\nfrequently, and that when the nights were at longest, the weather\ncoldest, and so consequently the season most unseasonable, that that\nwinter was to the town of Mansoul a winter by itself.  Sometimes the\ntrumpets would sound, and sometimes the slings would whirl the stones\ninto the town.  Sometimes ten thousand of the King’s soldiers would be\nrunning round the walls of Mansoul at midnight, shouting and lifting up\nthe voice for the battle.  Sometimes, again, some of them in the town\nwould be wounded, and their cry and lamentable voice would be heard, to\nthe great molestation of the now languishing town of Mansoul.  Yea, so\ndistressed with those that laid siege against them were they, that, I\ndare say, Diabolus, their king, had in these days his rest much broken.\n\nIn these days, as I was informed, new thoughts, and thoughts that began\nto run counter one to another, began to possess the minds of the men of\nthe town of Mansoul.  Some would say, ‘There is no living thus.’  Others\nwould then reply, ‘This will be over shortly.’  Then would a third stand\nup and answer, ‘Let us turn to the King Shaddai, and so put an end to\nthese troubles.’  And a fourth would come in with a fear, saying, ‘I\ndoubt he will not receive us.’  The old gentleman, too, the Recorder,\nthat was so before Diabolus took Mansoul, he also began to talk aloud,\nand his words were now to the town of Mansoul as if they were great claps\nof thunder.  No noise now so terrible to Mansoul as was his, with the\nnoise of the soldiers and shoutings of the captains.\n\nAlso things began to grow scarce in Mansoul; now the things that her soul\nlusted after were departing from her.  Upon all her pleasant things there\nwas a blast, and burning instead of beauty.  Wrinkles now, and some shows\nof the shadow of death, were upon the inhabitants of Mansoul.  And now, O\nhow glad would Mansoul have been to have enjoyed quietness and\nsatisfaction of mind, though joined with the meanest condition in the\nworld!\n\nThe captains also, in the deep of this winter, did send by the mouth of\nBoanerges’ trumpeter a summons to Mansoul to yield up herself to the\nKing, the great King Shaddai.  They sent it once, and twice, and thrice;\nnot knowing but that at some times there might be in Mansoul some\nwillingness to surrender up themselves unto them, might they but have the\ncolour of an invitation to do it under.  Yea, so far as I could gather,\nthe town had been surrendered up to them before now, had it not been for\nthe opposition of old Incredulity, and the fickleness of the thoughts of\nmy Lord Willbewill.  Diabolus also began to rave; wherefore Mansoul, as\nto yielding, was not yet all of one mind; therefore they still lay\ndistressed under these perplexing fears.\n\nI told you but now that they of the King’s army had this winter sent\nthree times to Mansoul to submit herself.\n\nThe first time the trumpeter went he went with words of peace, telling\nthem that the captains, the noble captains of Shaddai, did pity and\nbewail the misery of the now perishing town of Mansoul, and were troubled\nto see them so much to stand in the way of their own deliverance.  He\nsaid, moreover, that the captains bid him tell them, that if now poor\nMansoul would humble herself and turn, her former rebellions and most\nnotorious treasons should by their merciful King be forgiven them, yea,\nand forgotten too.  And having bid them beware that they stood not in\ntheir own way, that they opposed not themselves, nor made themselves\ntheir own losers, he returned again into the camp.\n\nThe second time the trumpeter went, he did treat them a little more\nroughly; for, after sound of trumpet, he told them that their continuing\nin their rebellion did but chafe and heat the spirit of the captains, and\nthat they were resolved to make a conquest of Mansoul, or to lay their\nbones before the town walls.\n\nHe went again the third time, and dealt with them yet more roughly;\ntelling them that now, since they had been so horribly profane, he did\nnot know, not certainly know, whether the captains were inclining to\nmercy or judgment.  ‘Only,’ said he, ‘they commanded me to give you a\nsummons to open the gates unto them.’  So he returned, and went into the\ncamp.\n\nThese three summonses, and especially the last two, did so distress the\ntown that they presently call a consultation, the result of which was\nthis—That my Lord Willbewill should go up to Ear-gate, and there, with\nsound of trumpet, call to the captains of the camp for a parley.  Well,\nthe Lord Willbewill sounded upon the wall; so the captains came up in\ntheir harness, with their ten thousands at their feet.  The townsmen then\ntold the captains that they had heard and considered their summons, and\nwould come to an agreement with them, and with their King Shaddai, upon\nsuch certain terms, articles, and propositions as, with and by the order\nof their prince, they to them were appointed to propound; to wit, they\nwould agree upon these grounds to be one people with them.\n\n1. If that those of their own company, as the now Lord Mayor and their\nMr. Forget-Good, with then brave Lord Willbewill, might, under Shaddai,\nbe still the governors of the town, castle, and gates of Mansoul.\n\n2. Provided that no man that now serveth under their great giant Diabolus\nbe by Shaddai cast out of house, harbour, or the freedom that he hath\nhitherto enjoyed in the famous town of Mansoul.\n\n3. That it shall be granted them, that they of the town of Mansoul shall\nenjoy certain of their rights and privileges; to wit, such as have\nformerly been granted them, and that they have long lived in the\nenjoyment of, under the reign of their king Diabolus, that now is, and\nlong has been, their only lord and great defender.\n\n4. That no new law, officer, or executioner of law or office, shall have\nany power over them, without their own choice and consent.\n\n‘These be our propositions, or conditions of peace; and upon these\nterms,’ said they, ‘we will submit to your King.’\n\nBut when the captains had heard this weak and feeble offer of the town of\nMansoul, and their high and bold demands, they made to them again, by\ntheir noble captain, the Captain Boanerges, this speech following:\n\n‘O ye inhabitants of the town of Mansoul, when I heard your trumpet sound\nfor a parley with us, I can truly say I was glad; but when you said you\nwere willing to submit yourselves to our King and Lord, then I was yet\nmore glad; but when, by your silly provisos and foolish cavils, you laid\nthe stumbling-block of your iniquity before your own faces, then was my\ngladness turned into sorrows, and my hopeful beginnings of your return,\ninto languishing fainting fears.\n\n‘I count that old Ill-Pause, the ancient enemy of Mansoul, did draw up\nthose proposals that now you present us with as terms of an agreement;\nbut they deserve not to be admitted to sound in the ear of any man that\npretends to have service for Shaddai.  We do therefore jointly, and that\nwith the highest disdain, refuse and reject such things, as the greatest\nof iniquities.\n\n‘But, O Mansoul, if you will give yourselves into our hands, or rather\ninto the hands of our King, and will trust him to make such terms with\nand for you as shall seem good in his eyes, (and I dare say they shall be\nsuch as you shall find to be most profitable to you,) then we will\nreceive you, and be at peace with you; but if you like not to trust\nyourselves in the arms of Shaddai our King, then things are but where\nthey were before, and we know also what we have to do.’\n\nThen cried out old Incredulity, the Lord Mayor, and said, ‘And who, being\nout of the hands of their enemies, as ye see we are now, will be so\nfoolish as to put the staff out of their own hands into the hands of they\nknow not who?  I, for my part, will never yield to so unlimited a\nproposition.  Do we know the manner and temper of their King?  It is said\nby some that he will be angry with his subjects if but the breadth of an\nhair they chance to step out of the way; and by others, that he requireth\nof them much more than they can perform.  Wherefore, it seems, O Mansoul,\nto be thy wisdom to take good heed what thou dost in this matter; for if\nyou once yield, you give up yourselves to another, and so you are no more\nyour own.  Wherefore, to give up yourselves to an unlimited power, is the\ngreatest folly in the world; for now you indeed may repent, but can never\njustly complain.  But do you indeed know, when you are his, which of you\nhe will kill, and which of you he will save alive; or whether he will not\ncut off every one of us, and send out of his own country another new\npeople, and cause them to inhabit this town?’\n\nThis speech of the Lord Mayor undid all, and threw flat to the ground\ntheir hopes of an accord.  Wherefore the captains returned to their\ntrenches, to their tents, and to their men, as they were; and the Mayor\nto the castle and to his King.\n\nNow Diabolus had waited for his return, for he had heard that they had\nbeen at their points.  So, when he was come into the chamber of state,\nDiabolus saluted him with—‘Welcome, my lord.  How went matters betwixt\nyou to-day?’  So the Lord Incredulity, with a low congee, told him the\nwhole of the matter, saying, ‘Thus and thus said the captains of Shaddai,\nand thus and thus said I.’  The which when it was told to Diabolus, he\nwas very glad to hear it, and said, ‘My Lord Mayor, my faithful\nIncredulity, I have proved thy fidelity above ten times already, but\nnever yet found thee false.  I do promise thee, if we rub over this\nbrunt, to prefer thee to a place of honour, a place far better than to be\nLord Mayor of Mansoul.  I will make thee my universal deputy, and thou\nshalt, next to me, have all nations under thy hand; yea, and thou shalt\nlay bands upon them, that they may not resist thee; nor shall any of our\nvassals walk more at liberty, but those that shall be content to walk in\nthy fetters.’\n\nNow came the Lord Mayor out from Diabolus, as if he had obtained a favour\nindeed.  Wherefore to his habitation he goes in great state, and thinks\nto feed himself well enough with hopes, until the time came that his\ngreatness should be enlarged.\n\nBut now, though the Lord Mayor and Diabolus did thus well agree, yet this\nrepulse to the brave captains put Mansoul into a mutiny.  For while old\nIncredulity went into the castle to congratulate his lord with what had\npassed, the old Lord Mayor, that was so before Diabolus came to the town,\nto wit, my Lord Understanding, and the old Recorder, Mr. Conscience,\ngetting intelligence of what had passed at Ear-gate, (for you must know\nthat they might not be suffered to be at that debate, lest they should\nthen have mutinied for the captains; but, I say, they got intelligence of\nwhat had passed there, and were much concerned therewith,) wherefore\nthey, getting some of the town together, began to possess them with the\nreasonableness of the noble captains’ demands, and with the bad\nconsequences that would follow upon the speech of old Incredulity, the\nLord Mayor; to wit how little reverence he showed therein either to the\ncaptains or to their King; also how he implicitly charged them with\nunfaithfulness and treachery.  ‘For what less,’ quoth they, ‘could be\nmade of his words, when he said he would not yield to their proposition;\nand added, moreover, a supposition that he would destroy us, when before\nhe had sent us word that he would show us mercy!’  The multitude, being\nnow possessed with the conviction of the evil that old Incredulity had\ndone, began to run together by companies in all places, and in every\ncorner of the streets of Mansoul; and first they began to mutter, then to\ntalk openly, and after that they run to and fro, and cried as they run,\n‘Oh the brave captains of Shaddai! would we were under the government of\nthe captains, and of Shaddai their King!’  When the Lord Mayor had\nintelligence that Mansoul was in an uproar, down he comes to appease the\npeople, and thought to have quashed their heat with the bigness and the\nshow of his countenance; but when they saw him, they came running upon\nhim, and had doubtless done him a mischief, had he not betaken himself to\nhouse.  However, they strongly assaulted the house where he was, to have\npulled it down about his ears; but the place was too strong, so they\nfailed of that.  So he, taking some courage, addressed himself, out at a\nwindow, to the people in this manner:\n\n‘Gentlemen, what is the reason that there is here such an uproar to-day?’\n\nThen answered my Lord Understanding, ‘It is even because that thou and\nthy master have carried it not rightly, and as you should, to the\ncaptains of Shaddai; for in three things you are faulty.  First, in that\nyou would not let Mr. Conscience and myself be at the hearing of your\ndiscourse.  Secondly, in that you propounded such terms of peace to the\ncaptains that by no means could be granted, unless they had intended that\ntheir Shaddai should have been only a titular prince, and that Mansoul\nshould still have had power by law to have lived in all lewdness and\nvanity before him, and so by consequence Diabolus should still here be\nking in power, and the other only king in name.  Thirdly, for that thou\ndidst thyself, after the captains had showed us upon what conditions they\nwould have received us to mercy, even undo all again with thy unsavoury,\nunseasonable, and ungodly speech.’\n\nWhen old Incredulity had heard this speech, he cried out, ‘Treason!\ntreason!  To your arms! to your arms!  O ye, the trusty friends of\nDiabolus in Mansoul.’\n\n_Und._—Sir, you may put upon my words what meaning you please; but I am\nsure that the captains of such an high lord as theirs is, deserved a\nbetter treatment at your hands.\n\nThen said old Incredulity, ‘This is but little better.  But, Sir,’ quoth\nhe, ‘what I spake I spake for my prince, for his government, and the\nquieting of the people, whom by your unlawful actions you have this day\nset to mutiny against us.’\n\nThen replied the old Recorder, whose name was Mr. Conscience, and said,\n‘Sir, you ought not thus to retort upon what my Lord Understanding hath\nsaid.  It is evident enough that he hath spoken the truth, and that you\nare an enemy to Mansoul.  Be convinced, then, of the evil of your saucy\nand malapert language, and of the grief that you have put the captains\nto; yea, and of the damages that you have done to Mansoul thereby.  Had\nyou accepted of the conditions, the sound of the trumpet and the alarm of\nwar had now ceased about the town of Mansoul; but that dreadful sound\nabides, and your want of wisdom in your speech has been the cause of it.’\n\nThen said old Incredulity, ‘Sir, if I live, I will do your errand to\nDiabolus, and there you shall have an answer to your words.  Meanwhile we\nwill seek the good of the town, and not ask counsel of you.’\n\n_Und._—Sir, your prince and you are both foreigners to Mansoul, and not\nthe natives thereof; and who can tell but that, when you have brought us\ninto greater straits, (when you also shall see that yourselves can be\nsafe by no other means than by flight,) you may leave us and shift for\nyourselves, or set us on fire, and go away in the smoke, or by the light\nof our burning, and so leave us in our ruins?\n\n_Incred._—Sir, you forget that you are under a governor, and that you\nought to demean yourself like a subject; and know ye, when my lord the\nking shall hear of this day’s work, he will give you but little thanks\nfor your labour.\n\nNow while these gentlemen were thus in their chiding words, down come\nfrom the walls and gates of the town the Lord Willbewill, Mr. Prejudice,\nold Ill-Pause, and several of the new-made aldermen and burgesses, and\nthey asked the reason of the hubbub and tumult; and with that every man\nbegan to tell his own tale, so that nothing could be heard distinctly.\nThen was a silence commanded, and the old fox Incredulity began to speak.\n‘My lord,’ quoth he, ‘here are a couple of peevish gentlemen, that have,\nas a fruit of their bad dispositions, and, as I fear, through the advice\nof one Mr. Discontent, tumultuously gathered this company against me this\nday, and also attempted to run the town into acts of rebellion against\nour prince.’\n\nThen stood up all the Diabolonians that were present, and affirmed these\nthings to be true.\n\nNow when they that took part with my Lord Understanding and with Mr.\nConscience perceived that they were like to come to the worst, for that\nforce and power was on the other side, they came in for their help and\nrelief; so a great company was on both sides.  Then they on Incredulity’s\nside would have had the two old gentlemen presently away to prison; but\nthey on the other side said they should not.  Then they began to cry up\nparties again: the Diabolonians cried up old Incredulity, Forget-Good,\nthe new aldermen, and their great one Diabolus; and the other party, they\nas fast cried up Shaddai, the captains, his laws, their mercifulness, and\napplauded their conditions and ways.  Thus the bickerment went awhile; at\nlast they passed from words to blows, and now there were knocks on both\nsides.  The good old gentleman, Mr. Conscience, was knocked down twice by\none of the Diabolonians, whose name was Mr. Benumbing; and my Lord\nUnderstanding had like to have been slain with an arquebuse, but that he\nthat shot did not take his aim aright.  Nor did the other side wholly\nescape; for there was one Mr. Rashhead, a Diabolonian, that had his\nbrains beaten out by Mr. Mind, the Lord Willbewill’s servant; and it made\nme laugh to see how old Mr. Prejudice was kicked and tumbled about in the\ndirt; for though, a while since, he was made captain of a company of the\nDiabolonians, to the hurt and damage of the town, yet now they had got\nhim under their feet, and, I’ll assure you, he had, by some of the Lord\nUnderstanding’s party, his crown cracked to boot.  Mr. Anything also, he\nbecame a brisk man in the broil; but both sides were against him, because\nhe was true to none.  Yet he had, for his malapertness, one of his legs\nbroken, and he that did it wished it had been his neck.  Much more harm\nwas done on both sides, but this must not be forgotten; it was now a\nwonder to see my Lord Willbewill so indifferent as he was: he did not\nseem to take one side more than another, only it was perceived that he\nsmiled to see how old Prejudice was tumbled up and down in the dirt.\nAlso, when Captain Anything came halting up before him, he seemed to take\nbut little notice of him.\n\nNow, when the uproar was over, Diabolus sends for my Lord Understanding\nand Mr. Conscience, and claps them both up in prison as the ringleaders\nand managers of this most heavy, riotous rout in Mansoul.  So now the\ntown began to be quiet again, and the prisoners were used hardly; yea, he\nthought to have made them away, but that the present juncture did not\nserve for that purpose, for that war was in all their gates.\n\nBut let us return again to our story.  The captains, when they were gone\nback from the gate, and were come into the camp again, called a council\nof war, to consult what was further for them to do.  Now, some said, ‘Let\nus go up presently, and fall upon the town;’ but the greatest part\nthought rather better it would be to give them another summons to yield;\nand the reason why they thought this to be best was, because that, so far\nas could be perceived, the town of Mansoul now was more inclinable than\nheretofore.  ‘And if,’ said they, ‘while some of them are in a way of\ninclination, we should by ruggedness give them distaste, we may set them\nfurther from closing with our summons than we would be willing they\nshould.’  Wherefore to this advice they agreed, and called a trumpeter,\nput words into his mouth, set him his time, and bid him God speed.  Well,\nmany hours were not expired before the trumpeter addressed himself to his\njourney.  Wherefore, coming up to the wall of the town, he steereth his\ncourse to Ear-gate, and there sounded, as he was commanded.  They then\nthat were within came out to see what was the matter, and the trumpeter\nmade them this speech following:\n\n‘O hard-hearted and deplorable town of Mansoul, how long wilt thou love\nthy sinful, sinful simplicity, and, ye fools, delight in your scorning?\nAs yet despise you the offers of peace and deliverance?  As yet will ye\nrefuse the golden offers of Shaddai, and trust to the lies and falsehoods\nof Diabolus?  Think you, when Shaddai shall have conquered you, that the\nremembrance of these your carriages towards him will yield you peace and\ncomfort, or that by ruffling language you can make him afraid as a\ngrasshopper?  Doth he entreat you for fear of you?  Do you think that you\nare stronger than he?  Look to the heavens, and behold and consider the\nstars, how high are they?  Can you stop the sun from running his course,\nand hinder the moon from giving her light?  Can you count the number of\nthe stars, or stay the bottles of heaven?  Can you call for the waters of\nthe sea, and cause them to cover the face of the ground?  Can you behold\nevery one that is proud, and abase him, and bind their faces in secret?\nYet these are some of the works of our King, in whose name this day we\ncome up unto you, that you may be brought under his authority.  In his\nname, therefore, I summon you again to yield up yourselves to his\ncaptains.’\n\nAt this summons the Mansoulians seemed to be at a stand, and knew not\nwhat answer to make.  Wherefore Diabolus forthwith appeared, and took\nupon him to do it himself; and thus he begins, but turns his speech to\nthem of Mansoul.\n\n‘Gentlemen,’ quoth he, ‘and my faithful subjects, if it is true that this\nsummoner hath said concerning the greatness of their King, by his terror\nyou will always be kept in bondage, and so be made to sneak.  Yea, how\ncan you now, though he is at a distance, endure to think of such a mighty\none?  And if not to think of him while at a distance, how can you endure\nto be in his presence?  I, your prince, am familiar with you, and you may\nplay with me as you would with a grasshopper.  Consider, therefore, what\nis for your profit, and remember the immunities that I have granted you.\n\n‘Farther, if all be true that this man hath said, how comes it to pass\nthat the subjects of Shaddai are so enslaved in all places where they\ncome?  None in the universe so unhappy as they, none so trampled upon as\nthey.\n\n‘Consider, my Mansoul: would thou wert as loath to leave me as I am loath\nto leave thee.  But consider, I say, the ball is yet at thy foot; liberty\nyou have, if you know how to use it; yea, a king you have too, if you can\ntell how to love and obey him.’\n\nUpon this speech, the town of Mansoul did again harden their hearts yet\nmore against the captains of Shaddai.  The thoughts of his greatness did\nquite quash them, and the thoughts of his holiness sunk them in despair.\nWherefore, after a short consult, they (of the Diabolonian party they\nwere) sent back this word by the trumpeter, That, for their parts, they\nwere resolved to stick to their king, but never to yield to Shaddai; so\nit was but in vain to give them any further summons, for they had rather\ndie upon the place than yield.  And now things seemed to be gone quite\nback, and Mansoul to be out of reach or call, yet the captains who knew\nwhat their Lord could do, would not yet be beat out of heart; they\ntherefore sent them another summons, more sharp and severe than the last;\nbut the oftener they were sent to, to reconcile to Shaddai, the further\noff they were.  ‘As they called them, so they went from them—yea, though\nthey called them to the Most High.’\n\nSo they ceased that way to deal with them any more, and inclined to think\nof another way.  The captains, therefore, did gather themselves together,\nto have free conference among themselves, to know what was yet to be done\nto gain the town, and to deliver it from the tyranny of Diabolus; and one\nsaid after this manner, and another after that.  Then stood up the right\nnoble the Captain Conviction, and said, ‘My brethren, mine opinion is\nthis:\n\n‘First, that we continually play our slings into the town, and keep it in\na continual alarm, molesting them day and night.  By thus doing, we shall\nstop the growth of their rampant spirit; for a lion may be tamed by\ncontinual molestation.\n\n‘Secondly, this done, I advise that, in the next place, we with one\nconsent draw up a petition to our Lord Shaddai, by which, after we have\nshowed our King the condition of Mansoul and of affairs here, and have\nbegged his pardon for our no better success, we will earnestly implore\nhis Majesty’s help, and that he will please to send us more force and\npower, and some gallant and well-spoken commander to head them, that so\nhis Majesty may not lose the benefit of these his good beginnings, but\nmay complete his conquest upon the town of Mansoul.’\n\nTo this speech of the noble Captain Conviction they as one man consented,\nand agreed that a petition should forthwith be drawn up, and sent by a\nfit man away to Shaddai with speed.  The contents of the petition were\nthus:—\n\n‘Most gracious and glorious King, the Lord of the best world, and the\nbuilder of the town of Mansoul, we have, dread Sovereign, at thy\ncommandment, put our lives in jeopardy, and at thy bidding made a war\nupon the famous town of Mansoul.  When we went up against it, we did,\naccording to our commission, first offer conditions of peace unto it.\nBut they, great King, set light by our counsel, and would none of our\nreproof.  They were for shutting their gates, and for keeping us out of\nthe town.  They also mounted their guns, they sallied out upon us, and\nhave done us what damage they could; but we pursued them with alarm upon\nalarm, requiting them with such retribution as was meet, and have done\nsome execution upon the town.\n\n‘Diabolus, Incredulity, and Willbewill are the great doers against us:\nnow we are in our winter quarters, but so as that we do yet with an high\nhand molest and distress the town.\n\n‘Once, as we think, had we had but one substantial friend in the town,\nsuch as would but have seconded the sound of our summons as they ought,\nthe people might have yielded themselves; but there were none but enemies\nthere, nor any to speak in behalf of our Lord to the town.  Wherefore,\nthough we have done as we could, yet Mansoul abides in a state of\nrebellion against thee.\n\n‘Now, King of kings, let it please thee to pardon the unsuccessfulness of\nthy servants, who have been no more advantageous in so desirable a work\nas the conquering of Mansoul is.  And send, Lord, as we now desire, more\nforces to Mansoul, that it may be subdued; and a man to head them, that\nthe town may both love and fear.\n\n‘We do not thus speak because we are willing to relinquish the wars, (for\nwe are for laying of our bones against the place,) but that the town of\nMansoul may be won for thy Majesty.  We also pray thy Majesty, for\nexpedition in this matter, that, after their conquest, we may be at\nliberty to be sent about other thy gracious designs.  Amen.’\n\nThe petition, thus drawn up, was sent away with haste to the King by the\nhand of that good man, Mr. Love-to-Mansoul.\n\nWhen this petition was come to the palace of the King, who should it be\ndelivered to but to the King’s Son?  So he took it and read it, and\nbecause the contents of it pleased him well, he mended, and also in some\nthings added to the petition himself.  So, after he had made such\namendments and additions as he thought convenient, with his own hand, he\ncarried it in to the King; to whom, when he had with obeisance delivered\nit, he put on authority, and spake to it himself.\n\nNow the King, at the sight of the petition, was glad; but how much more,\nthink you, when it was seconded by his Son!  It pleased him also to hear\nthat his servants who camped against Mansoul were so hearty in the work,\nand so steadfast in their resolves, and that they had already got some\nground upon the famous town of Mansoul.\n\nWherefore the King called to him Emmanuel, his Son, who said, ‘Here am I,\nmy Father.’  Then said the King, ‘Thou knowest, as I do myself, the\ncondition of the town of Mansoul, and what we have purposed, and what\nthou hast done to redeem it.  Come now, therefore, my Son, and prepare\nthyself for the war, for thou shalt go to my camp at Mansoul.  Thou shalt\nalso there prosper and prevail, and conquer the town of Mansoul.’\n\nThen said the King’s Son, ‘Thy law is within my heart: I delight to do\nthy will.  This is the day that I have longed for, and the work that I\nhave waited for all this while.  Grant me, therefore, what force thou\nshalt in thy wisdom think meet; and I will go and will deliver from\nDiabolus, and from his power, thy perishing town of Mansoul.  My heart\nhas been often pained within me for the miserable town of Mansoul; but\nnow it is rejoiced, but now it is glad.’\n\nAnd with that he leaped over the mountains for joy, saying, ‘I have not,\nin my heart, thought anything too dear for Mansoul: the day of vengeance\nis in mine heart for thee, my Mansoul: and glad am I that thou, my\nFather, hast made me the Captain of their salvation.  And I will now\nbegin to plague all those that have been a plague to my town of Mansoul,\nand will deliver it from their hand.’\n\nWhen the King’s Son had said thus to his Father, it presently flew like\nlightning round about at court; yea, it there became the only talk what\nEmmanuel was to go to do for the famous town of Mansoul.  But you cannot\nthink how the courtiers, too, were taken with this design of the Prince;\nyea, so affected were they with this work, and with the justness of the\nwar, that the highest lord and greatest peer of the kingdom did covet to\nhave commissions under Emmanuel, to go to help to recover again to\nShaddai the miserable town of Mansoul.\n\nThen was it concluded that some should go and carry tidings to the camp,\nthat Emmanuel was to come to recover Mansoul, and that he would bring\nalong with him so mighty, so impregnable a force, that he could not be\nresisted.  But, oh! how ready were the high ones at court to run like\nlackeys to carry these tidings to the camp that was at Mansoul.  Now,\nwhen the captains perceived that the King would send Emmanuel his Son,\nand that it also delighted the Son to be sent on this errand by the great\nShaddai his Father, they also, to show how they were pleased at the\nthoughts of his coming gave a shout that made the earth rend at the sound\nthereof.  Yea, the mountains did answer again by echo, and Diabolus\nhimself did totter and shake.\n\nFor you must know, that though the town of Mansoul itself was not much,\nif at all concerned with the project, (for, alas for them! they were\nwofully besotted, for they chiefly regarded their pleasure and their\nlusts,) yet Diabolus their governor was; for he had his spies continually\nabroad, who brought him intelligence of all things, and they told him\nwhat was doing at court against him, and that Emmanuel would shortly\ncertainly come with a power to invade him.  Nor was there any man at\ncourt, nor peer of the kingdom, that Diabolus so feared as he feared this\nPrince; for, if you remember, I showed you before that Diabolus had felt\nthe weight of his hand already; so that, since it was he that was to\ncome, this made him the more afraid.\n\nWell, you see how I have told you that the King’s Son was engaged to come\nfrom the court to save Mansoul, and that his Father had made him the\nCaptain of the forces.  The time, therefore, of his setting forth being\nnow expired, he addressed himself for his march, and taketh with him, for\nhis power, five noble captains and their forces.\n\n1. The first was that famous captain, the noble Captain Credence.  His\nwere the red colours, and Mr. Promise bare them; and for a scutcheon he\nhad the holy lamb and golden shield; and he had ten thousand men at his\nfeet.\n\n2. The second was that famous captain, the Captain Good-Hope.  His were\nthe blue colours; his standard-bearer was Mr. Expectation, and for his\nscutcheon he had the three golden anchors; and he had ten thousand men at\nhis feet.\n\n3. The third was that valiant captain, the Captain Charity.  His\nstandard-bearer was Mr. Pitiful: his were the green colours, and for his\nscutcheon he had three naked orphans embraced in the bosom; and he had\nten thousand men at his feet.\n\n4. The fourth was that gallant commander, the Captain Innocent.  His\nstandard-bearer was Mr. Harmless: his were the white colours, and for his\nscutcheon he had the three golden doves.\n\n5. The fifth was the truly loyal and well-beloved captain, the Captain\nPatience.  His standard-bearer was Mr. Suffer-Long: his were the black\ncolours, and for a scutcheon he had three arrows through the golden\nheart.\n\nThese were Emmanuel’s captains; these their standard-bearers, their\ncolours, and their scutcheons; and these the men under their command.\nSo, as was said, the brave Prince took his march to go to the town of\nMansoul.  Captain Credence led the van, and Captain Patience brought up\nthe rear; so the other three, with their men, made up the main body, the\nPrince himself riding in his chariot at the head of them.\n\nBut when they set out for their march, oh, how the trumpets sounded,\ntheir armour glittered, and how the colours waved in the wind!  The\nPrince’s armour was all of gold, and it shone like the sun in the\nfirmament; the captains’ armour was of proof, and was in appearance like\nthe glittering stars.  There were also some from the court that rode\nreformades for the love that they had to the King Shaddai, and for the\nhappy deliverance of the town of Mansoul.\n\nEmmanuel also, when he had thus set forwards to go to recover the town of\nMansoul, took with him, at the commandment of his Father, fifty-four\nbattering-rams, and twelve slings to whirl stones withal.  Every one of\nthese was made of pure gold, and these they carried with them, in the\nheart and body of their army, all along as they went to Mansoul.\n\nSo they marched till they came within less than a league of the town;\nthere they lay till the first four captains came thither to acquaint them\nwith matters.  Then they took their journey to go to the town of Mansoul,\nand unto Mansoul they came; but when the old soldiers that were in the\ncamp saw that they had new forces to join with, they again gave such a\nshout before the walls of the town of Mansoul, that it put Diabolus into\nanother fright.  So they sat down before the town, not now as the other\nfour captains did, to wit, against the gates of Mansoul only; but they\nenvironed it round on every side, and beset it behind and before; so that\nnow, let Mansoul look which way it will, it saw force and power lie in\nsiege against it.  Besides, there were mounts cast up against it.  The\nMount Gracious was on the one side, and Mount Justice was on the other.\nFurther, there were several small banks and advance-grounds, as\nPlain-Truth Hill and No-Sin Banks, where many of the slings were placed\nagainst the town.  Upon Mount Gracious were planted four, and upon Mount\nJustice were placed as many, and the rest were conveniently placed in\nseveral parts round about the town.  Five of the best battering-rams,\nthat is, of the biggest of them, were placed upon Mount Hearken, a mount\ncast up hard by Ear-gate, with intent to break that open.\n\nNow when the men of the town saw the multitude of the soldiers that were\ncome up against the place, and the rams and slings, and the mounts on\nwhich they were planted, together with the glittering of the armour and\nthe waving of their colours, they were forced to shift, and shift, and\nagain to shift their thoughts; but they hardly changed for thoughts more\nstout, but rather for thoughts more faint; for though before they thought\nthemselves sufficiently guarded, yet now they began to think that no man\nknew what would be their hap or lot.\n\nWhen the good Prince Emmanuel had thus beleaguered Mansoul, in the first\nplace he hangs out the white flag, which he caused to be set up among the\ngolden slings that were planted upon Mount Gracious.  And this he did for\ntwo reasons: 1. To give notice to Mansoul that he could and would yet be\ngracious if they turned to him.  2. And that he might leave them the more\nwithout excuse, should he destroy them, they continuing in their\nrebellion.\n\nSo the white flag, with the three golden doves in it, was hung out for\ntwo days together, to give them time and space to consider; but they, as\nwas hinted before, as if they were unconcerned, made no reply to the\nfavourable signal of the Prince.\n\nThen he commanded, and they set the red flag upon that mount called Mount\nJustice.  It was the red flag of Captain Judgment, whose scutcheon was\nthe burning fiery furnace; and this also stood waving before them in the\nwind for several days together.  But look how they carried it under the\nwhite flag, when that was hung out, so did they also when the red one\nwas; and yet he took no advantage of them.\n\nThen he commanded again that his servants should hang out the black flag\nof defiance against them, whose scutcheon was the three burning\nthunderbolts; but as unconcerned was Mansoul at this as at those that\nwent before.  But when the Prince saw that neither mercy nor judgment,\nnor execution of judgment, would or could come near the heart of Mansoul,\nhe was touched with much compunction, and said, ‘Surely this strange\ncarriage of the town of Mansoul doth rather arise from ignorance of the\nmanner and feats of war, than from a secret defiance of us, and\nabhorrence of their own lives; or if they know the manner of the war of\ntheir own, yet not the rites and ceremonies of the wars in which we are\nconcerned, when I make wars upon mine enemy Diabolus.’\n\nTherefore he sent to the town of Mansoul, to let them know what he meant\nby those signs and ceremonies of the flag; and also to know of them which\nof the things they would choose, whether grace and mercy, or judgment and\nthe execution of judgment.  All this while they kept their gates shut\nwith locks, bolts, and bars, as fast as they could.  Their guards also\nwere doubled, and their watch made as strong as they could.  Diabolus\nalso did pluck up what heart he could, to encourage the town to make\nresistance.\n\nThe townsmen also made answer to the Prince’s messenger, in substance\naccording to that which follows:—\n\n‘Great Sir,—As to what, by your messenger, you have signified to us,\nwhether we will accept of your mercy, or fall by your justice, we are\nbound by the law and custom of this place, and can give you no positive\nanswer; for it is against the law, government, and the prerogative royal\nof our king, to make either peace or war without him.  But this we will\ndo,—we will petition that our prince will come down to the wall, and\nthere give you such treatment as he shall think fit and profitable for\nus.’\n\nWhen the good Prince Emmanuel heard this answer, and saw the slavery and\nbondage of the people, and how much content they were to abide in the\nchains of the tyrant Diabolus, it grieved him at the heart; and, indeed,\nwhen at any time he perceived that any were contented under the slavery\nof the giant, he would be affected with it.\n\nBut to return again to our purpose.  After the town had carried this news\nto Diabolus, and had told him, moreover, that the Prince, that lay in the\nleaguer without the wall, waited upon them for an answer, he refused, and\nhuffed as well as he could; but in heart he was afraid.\n\nThen said he, ‘I will go down to the gates myself, and give him such an\nanswer as I think fit.’  So he went down to Mouth-gate, and there\naddressed himself to speak to Emmanuel, (but in such language as the town\nunderstood not,) the contents whereof were as follows:—\n\n‘O thou great Emmanuel, Lord of all the world, I know thee, that thou art\nthe Son of the great Shaddai!  Wherefore art thou come to torment me, and\nto cast me out of my possession?  This town of Mansoul, as thou very well\nknowest, is mine, and that by a twofold right. 1. It is mine by right of\nconquest; I won it in the open field; and shall the prey be taken from\nthe mighty, or the lawful captive be delivered?  2. This town of Mansoul\nis mine also by their subjection.  They have opened the gates of their\ntown unto me; they have sworn fidelity to me, and have openly chosen me\nto be their king; they have also given their castle into my hands; yea,\nthey have put the whole strength of Mansoul under me.\n\n‘Moreover, this town of Mansoul hath disavowed thee, yea, they have cast\nthy law, thy name, thy image, and all that is thine, behind their back,\nand have accepted and set up in their room my law, my name, my image, and\nall that ever is mine.  Ask else thy captains, and they will tell thee\nthat Mansoul hath, in answer to all their summonses, shown love and\nloyalty to me, but always disdain, despite, contempt, and scorn to thee\nand thine.  Now, thou art the Just One and the Holy, and shouldest do no\niniquity.  Depart, then, I pray thee, therefore, from me, and leave me to\nmy just inheritance peaceably.’\n\nThis oration was made in the language of Diabolus himself; for although\nhe can, to every man, speak in their own language, (else he could not\ntempt them all as he does,) yet he has a language proper to himself, and\nit is the language of the infernal cave, or black pit.\n\nWherefore the town of Mansoul (poor hearts!) understood him not; nor did\nthey see how he crouched and cringed while he stood before Emmanuel,\ntheir Prince.\n\nYea, they all this while took him to be one of that power and force that\nby no means could be resisted.  Wherefore, while he was thus entreating\nthat he might have yet his residence there, and that Emmanuel would not\ntake it from him by force, the inhabitants boasted even of his valour,\nsaying, ‘Who is able to make war with him?’\n\nWell, when this pretended king had made an end of what he would say,\nEmmanuel, the golden Prince, stood up and spake; the contents of whose\nwords follow:—\n\n‘Thou deceiving one,’ said he, ‘I have, in my Father’s name, in mine own\nname, and on the behalf and for the good of this wretched town of\nMansoul, somewhat to say unto thee.  Thou pretendest a right, a lawful\nright, to the deplorable town of Mansoul, when it is most apparent to all\nmy Father’s court that the entrance which thou hast obtained in at the\ngates of Mansoul was through thy lie and falsehood; thou beliedst my\nFather, thou beliedst his law, and so deceivedst the people of Mansoul.\nThou pretendest that the people have accepted thee for their king, their\ncaptain, and right liege lord; but that also was by the exercise of\ndeceit and guile.  Now, if lying, wiliness, sinful craft, and all manner\nof horrible hypocrisy, will go in my Father’s court (in which court thou\nmust be tried) for equity and right, then will I confess unto thee that\nthou hast made a lawful conquest.  But, alas! what thief, what tyrant,\nwhat devil is there that may not conquer after this sort?  But I can make\nit appear, O Diabolus, that thou, in all thy pretences to a conquest of\nMansoul, hast nothing of truth to say.  Thinkest thou this to be right,\nthat that didst put the lie upon my Father, and madest him (to Mansoul)\nthe greatest deluder in the world?  And what sayest thou to thy\nperverting knowingly the right purport and intent of the law?  Was it\ngood also that thou madest a prey of the innocency and simplicity of the\nnow miserable town of Mansoul?  Yea, thou didst overcome Mansoul by\npromising to them happiness in their transgressions against my Father’s\nlaw, when thou knewest, and couldest not but know, hadst thou consulted\nnothing but thine own experience, that that was the way to undo them.\nThou hast also thyself, O thou master of enmity, of spite defaced my\nFather’s image in Mansoul, and set up thy own in its place, to the great\ncontempt of my Father, the heightening of thy sin, and to the intolerable\ndamage of the perishing town of Mansoul.\n\n‘Thou hast, moreover, (as if all these were but little things with thee,)\nnot only deluded and undone this place, but, by thy lies and fradulent\ncarriage, hast set them against their own deliverance.  How hast thou\nstirred them up against my Father’s captains, and made them to fight\nagainst those that were sent of him to deliver them from their bondage!\nAll these things, and very many more, thou hast done against thy light,\nand in contempt of my Father and of his law, yea, and with design to\nbring under his displeasure for ever the miserable town of Mansoul.  I am\ntherefore come to avenge the wrong that thou hast done to my Father, and\nto deal with thee for the blasphemies wherewith thou hast made poor\nMansoul blaspheme his name.  Yea, upon thy head, thou prince of the\ninfernal cave, will I requite it.\n\n‘As for myself, O Diabolus, I am come against thee by lawful power, and\nto take, by strength of hand, this town of Mansoul out of thy burning\nfingers; for this town of Mansoul is mine, O Diabolus, and that by\nundoubted right, as all shall see that will diligently search the most\nancient and most authentic records, and I will plead my title to it, to\nthe confusion of thy face.\n\n‘First, for the town of Mansoul, my Father built and did fashion it with\nhis hand.  The palace also that is in the midst of that town, he built it\nfor his own delight.  This town of Mansoul, therefore, is my Father’s,\nand that by the best of titles, and he that gainsays the truth of this\nmust lie against his soul.\n\n‘Secondly, O thou master of the lie, this town of Mansoul is mine.\n\n‘1. For that I am my Father’s heir, his firstborn, and the only delight\nof his heart.  I am therefore come up against thee in mine own right,\neven to recover mine own inheritance out of thine hand.\n\n‘2. But further, as I have a right and title to Mansoul by being my\nFather’s heir, so I have also by my Father’s donation.  His it was, and\nhe gave it me; nor have I at any time offended my Father, that he should\ntake it from me, and give it to thee.  Nor have I been forced, by playing\nthe bankrupt, to sell or set to sale to thee my beloved town of Mansoul.\nMansoul is my desire, my delight, and the joy of my heart.  But,\n\n‘3. Mansoul is mine by right of purchase.  I have bought it, O Diabolus,\nI have bought it to myself.  Now, since it was my Father’s and mine, as I\nwas his heir, and since also I have made it mine by virtue of a great\npurchase, it followeth that, by all lawful right, the town of Mansoul is\nmine, and that thou art an usurper, a tyrant, and traitor, in thy holding\npossession thereof.  Now, the cause of my purchasing of it was this:\nMansoul had trespassed against my Father; now my Father had said, that in\nthe day that they broke his law they should die.  Now, it is more\npossible for heaven and earth to pass away than for my Father to break\nhis word.  Wherefore when Mansoul had sinned indeed by hearkening to thy\nlie, I put in and became a surety to my Father, body for body, and soul\nfor soul, that I would make amends for Mansoul’s transgressions, and my\nFather did accept thereof.  So, when the time appointed was come, I gave\nbody for body, soul for soul, life for life, blood for blood, and so\nredeemed my beloved Mansoul.\n\n‘4. Nor did I do this by halves: my Father’s law and justice, that were\nboth concerned in the threatening upon transgression, are both now\nsatisfied, and very well content that Mansoul should be delivered.\n\n‘5. Nor am I come out this day against thee, but by commandment of my\nFather; it was he that said unto me, “Go down and deliver Mansoul.”\n\n‘Wherefore be it known unto thee, O thou fountain of deceit, and be it\nalso known to the foolish town of Mansoul, that I am not come against\nthee this day without my Father.\n\n‘And now,’ said the golden-headed Prince, ‘I have a word to the town of\nMansoul.’  But so soon as mention was made that he had a word to speak to\nthe besotted town of Mansoul, the gates were double-guarded, and all men\ncommanded not to give him audience.  So he proceeded and said, ‘O unhappy\ntown of Mansoul, I cannot but be touched with pity and compassion for\nthee.  Thou hast accepted of Diabolus for thy king, and art become a\nnurse and minister of Diabolonians against thy sovereign Lord.  Thy gates\nthou hast opened to him, but hast shut them fast against me; thou hast\ngiven him an hearing, but hast stopped thine ears at my cry.  He brought\nto thee thy destruction, and thou didst receive both him and it: I am\ncome to thee bringing salvation, but thou regardest me not.  Besides,\nthou hast, as with sacrilegious hands, taken thyself, with all that was\nmine in thee, and hast given all to my foe, and to the greatest enemy my\nFather has.  You have bowed and subjected yourselves to him, you have\nvowed and sworn yourselves to be his.  Poor Mansoul! what shall I do unto\nthee?  Shall I save thee?—shall I destroy thee?  What shall I do unto\nthee?  Shall I fall upon thee, and grind thee to powder, or make thee a\nmonument of the richest grace?  What shall I do unto thee?  Hearken,\ntherefore, thou town of Mansoul, hearken to my word, and thou shalt live.\nI am merciful, Mansoul, and thou shalt find me so: shut me not out of thy\ngates.\n\n‘O Mansoul, neither is my commission nor inclination at all to do thee\nhurt.  Why fliest thou so fast from thy friend, and stickest so close to\nthine enemy?  Indeed, I would have thee, because it becomes thee to be\nsorry for thy sin, but do not despair of life; this great force is not to\nhurt thee, but to deliver thee from thy bondage, and to reduce thee to\nthy obedience.\n\n‘My commission, indeed, is to make a war upon Diabolus thy king, and upon\nall Diabolonians with him; for he is the strong man armed that keeps the\nhouse, and I will have him out: his spoils I must divide, his armour I\nmust take from him, his hold I must cast him out of, and must make it a\nhabitation for myself.  And this, O Mansoul, shall Diabolus know when he\nshall be made to follow me in chains, and when Mansoul shall rejoice to\nsee it so.\n\n‘I could, would I now put forth my might, cause that forthwith he should\nleave you and depart; but I have it in my heart so to deal with him, as\nthat the justice of the war that I shall make upon him may be seen and\nacknowledged by all.  He hath taken Mansoul by fraud, and keeps it by\nviolence and deceit, and I will make him bare and naked in the eyes of\nall observers.\n\n‘All my words are true.  I am mighty to save, and will deliver my Mansoul\nout of his hand.’\n\nThis speech was intended chiefly for Mansoul, but Mansoul would not have\nthe hearing of it.  They shut up Ear-gate, they barricaded it up, they\nkept it locked and bolted, they set a guard thereat, and commanded that\nno Mansoulonian should go out to him, nor that any from the camp should\nbe admitted into the town.  All this they did, so horribly had Diabolus\nenchanted them to do, and seek to do for him, against their rightful Lord\nand Prince; wherefore no man, nor voice, nor sound of man that belonged\nto the glorious host, was to come into the town.\n\nSo when Emmanuel saw that Mansoul was thus involved in sin, he calls his\narmy together, (since now also his words were despised,) and gave out a\ncommandment throughout all his host to be ready against the time\nappointed.  Now, forasmuch as there was no way lawfully to take the town\nof Mansoul but to get in by the gates, and at Ear-gate as the chief,\ntherefore he commanded his captains and commanders to bring their rams,\ntheir slings and their men, and place them at Eye-gate and Ear-gate, in\norder to his taking the town.\n\nWhen Emmanuel had put all things in a readiness to give Diabolus battle,\nhe sent again to know of the town of Mansoul, if in peaceable manner they\nwould yield themselves, or whether they were yet resolved to put him to\ntry the utmost extremity?  They then, together with Diabolus their king,\ncalled a council of war, and resolved upon certain propositions that\nshould be offered to Emmanuel, if he will accept thereof, so they agreed;\nand then the next was, who should be sent on this errand.  Now, there was\nin the town of Mansoul an old man, a Diabolonian, and his name was Mr.\nLoth-to-stoop, a stiff man in his way, and a great doer for Diabolus;\nhim, therefore, they sent, and put into his mouth what he should say.  So\nhe went and came to the camp to Emmanuel, and when he was come, a time\nwas appointed to give him audience.  So at the time he came, and after a\nDiabolonian ceremony or two, he thus began and said, ‘Great sir, that it\nmay be known unto all men how good-natured a prince my master is, he has\nsent me to tell your lordship that he is very willing, rather than go to\nwar, to deliver up into your hands one half of the town of Mansoul.  I am\ntherefore to know if your Mightiness will accept of this proposition.’\n\nThen said Emmanuel, ‘The whole is mine by gift and purchase, wherefore I\nwill never lose one half.’\n\nThen said Mr. Loth-to-stoop, ‘Sir, my master hath said that he will be\ncontent that you shall be the nominal and titular Lord of all, if he may\npossess but a part.’\n\nThen Emmanuel answered, ‘The whole is mine really, not in name and word\nonly; wherefore I will be the sole lord and possessor of all, or of none\nat all, of Mansoul.’\n\nThen Mr. Loth-to-stoop said again, ‘Sir, behold the condescension of my\nmaster!  He says, that he will be content, if he may but have assigned to\nhim some place in Mansoul as a place to live privately in, and you shall\nbe Lord of all the rest.’\n\nThen said the golden Prince, ‘All that the Father giveth me shall come to\nme; and of all that he giveth me I will lose nothing—no, not a hoof nor a\nhair.  I will not, therefore, grant him, no, not the least corner of\nMansoul to dwell in; I will have all to myself.’\n\nThen Loth-to-stoop said again, ‘But, sir, suppose that my Lord should\nresign the whole town to you, only with this proviso, that he sometimes,\nwhen he comes into this country, may, for old acquaintance’ sake, be\nentertained as a wayfaring man for two days, or ten days or a month, or\nso.  May not this small matter be granted?’\n\nThen said Emmanuel, ‘No.  He came as a wayfaring man to David, nor did he\nstay long with him, and yet it had like to have cost David his soul.  I\nwill not consent that he ever should have any harbour more there.’\n\nThen said Mr. Loth-to-stoop, ‘Sir, you seem to be very hard.  Suppose my\nmaster should yield to all that your lordship hath said, provided that\nhis friends and kindred in Mansoul may have liberty to trade in the town,\nand to enjoy their present dwellings.  May not that be granted, sir?’\n\nThen said Emmanuel, ‘No; that is contrary to my Father’s will; for all,\nand all manner of Diabolonians that now are, or that at any time shall be\nfound in Mansoul, shall not only lose their lands and liberties, but also\ntheir lives.’\n\nThen said Mr. Loth-to-stoop again, ‘But, sir, may not my master and great\nlord, by letters, by passengers, by accidental opportunities, and the\nlike, maintain, if he shall deliver up all unto thee, some kind of old\nfriendship with Mansoul?’\n\nEmmanuel answered, ‘No, by no means; forasmuch as any such fellowship,\nfriendship, intimacy, or acquaintance, in what way, sort, or mode soever\nmaintained, will tend to the corrupting of Mansoul, the alienating of\ntheir affections from me, and the endangering of their peace with my\nFather.’\n\nMr. Loth-to-stoop yet added further, saying, ‘But, great sir, since my\nmaster hath many friends, and those that are dear to him, in Mansoul, may\nhe not, if he shall depart from them, even of his bounty and good-nature,\nbestow upon them, as he sees fit, some tokens of his love and kindness\nthat he had for them, to the end that Mansoul, when he is gone, may look\nupon such tokens of kindness once received from their old friend, and\nremember him who was once their king, and the merry times that they\nsometimes enjoyed one with another, while he and they lived in peace\ntogether?’\n\nThen said Emmanuel, ‘No; for if Mansoul come to be mine, I shall not\nadmit of nor consent that there should be the least scrap, shred, or dust\nof Diabolus left behind, as tokens of gifts bestowed upon any in Mansoul,\nthereby to call to remembrance the horrible communion that was betwixt\nthem and him.’\n\n‘Well, sir,’ said Mr. Loth-to-stoop, ‘I have one thing more to propound,\nand then I am got to the end of my commission.  Suppose that, when my\nmaster is gone from Mansoul, any that shall yet live in the town should\nhave such business of high concerns to do, that if they be neglected the\nparty shall be undone; and suppose, sir, that nobody can help in that\ncase so well as my master and lord, may not now my master be sent for\nupon so urgent an occasion as this?  Or if he may not be admitted into\nthe town, may not he and the person concerned meet in some of the\nvillages near Mansoul, and there lay their heads together, and there\nconsult of matters?’\n\nThis was the last of those ensnaring propositions that Mr. Loth-to-stoop\nhad to propound to Emmanuel on behalf of his master Diabolus; but\nEmmanuel would not grant it; for he said, ‘There can be no case, or\nthing, or matter fall out in Mansoul, when thy master shall be gone, that\nmay not be solved by my Father; besides, it will be a great disparagement\nto my Father’s wisdom and skill to admit any from Mansoul to go out to\nDiabolus for advice, when they are bid before, in everything, by prayer\nand supplication to let their requests be made known to my Father.\nFurther, this, should it be granted, would be to grant that a door should\nbe set open for Diabolus, and the Diabolonians in Mansoul, to hatch, and\nplot, and bring to pass treasonable designs, to the grief of my Father\nand me, and to the utter destruction of Mansoul.’\n\nWhen Mr. Loth-to-stoop had heard this answer, he took his leave of\nEmmanuel, and departed, saying that he would carry word to his master\nconcerning this whole affair.  So he departed, and came to Diabolus to\nMansoul, and told him the whole of the matter, and how Emmanuel would not\nadmit, no, not by any means, that he, when he was once gone out, should\nfor ever have anything more to do either in, or with any that are of the\ntown of Mansoul.  When Mansoul and Diabolus had heard this relation of\nthings, they with one consent concluded to use their best endeavour to\nkeep Emmanuel out of Mansoul, and sent old Ill-Pause, of whom you have\nheard before, to tell the Prince and his captains so.  So the old\ngentleman came up to the top of Ear-gate, and called to the camp for a\nhearing, who when they gave audience, he said, ‘I have in commandment\nfrom my high lord to bid you tell it to your Prince Emmanuel, that\nMansoul and their king are resolved to stand and fall together; and that\nit is in vain for your Prince to think of ever having Mansoul in his\nhand, unless he can take it by force.’  So some went and told to Emmanuel\nwhat old Ill-Pause, a Diabolonian in Mansoul, had said.  Then said the\nPrince, ‘I must try the power of my sword, for I will not (for all the\nrebellions and repulses that Mansoul has made against me) raise my siege\nand depart, but will assuredly take my Mansoul, and deliver it from the\nhand of her enemy.’  And with that he gave out a commandment that Captain\nBoanerges, Captain Conviction, Captain Judgment, and Captain Execution\nshould forthwith march up to Ear-gate with trumpets sounding, colours\nflying, and with shouting for the battle.  Also he would that Captain\nCredence should join himself with them.  Emmanuel, moreover, gave order\nthat Captain Good-Hope and Captain Charity should draw themselves up\nbefore Eye-gate.  He bid also that the rest of his captains and their men\nshould place themselves for the best of their advantage against the enemy\nround about the town; and all was done as he had commanded.\n\nThen he bid that the word should be given forth, and the word was at that\ntime, ‘EMMANUEL.’  Then was an alarm sounded, and the battering-rams were\nplayed, and the slings did whirl stones into the town amain, and thus the\nbattle began.  Now Diabolus himself did manage the townsmen in the war,\nand that at every gate; wherefore their resistance was the more forcible,\nhellish, and offensive to Emmanuel.  Thus was the good Prince engaged and\nentertained by Diabolus and Mansoul for several days together; and a\nsight worth seeing it was to behold how the captains of Shaddai behaved\nthemselves in this war.\n\nAnd first for Captain Boanerges, (not to under-value the rest,) he made\nthree most fierce assaults, one after another, upon Ear-gate, to the\nshaking of the posts thereof.  Captain Conviction, he also made up as\nfast with Boanerges as possibly he could, and both discerning that the\ngate began to yield, they commanded that the rams should still be played\nagainst it.  Now, Captain Conviction, going up very near to the gate, was\nwith great force driven back, and received three wounds in the mouth.\nAnd those that rode reformades, they went about to encourage the\ncaptains.\n\nFor the valour of the two captains, made mention of before, the Prince\nsent for them to his pavilion, and commanded that a while they should\nrest themselves, and that with somewhat they should be refreshed.  Care\nalso was taken for Captain Conviction, that he should be healed of his\nwounds.  The Prince also gave to each of them a chain of gold, and bid\nthem yet be of good courage.\n\nNor did Captain Good-Hope nor Captain Charity come behind in this most\ndesperate fight, for they so well did behave themselves at Eye-gate, that\nthey had almost broken it quite open.  These also had a reward from their\nPrince, as also had the rest of the captains, because they did valiantly\nround about the town.\n\nIn this engagement several of the officers of Diabolus were slain, and\nsome of the townsmen wounded.  For the officers, there was one Captain\nBoasting slain.  This Boasting thought that nobody could have shaken the\nposts of Ear-gate, nor have shaken the heart of Diabolus.  Next to him\nthere was one Captain Secure slain: this Secure used to say that the\nblind and lame in Mansoul were able to keep the gates of the town against\nEmmanuel’s army.  This Captain Secure did Captain Conviction cleave down\nthe head with a two-handed sword, when he received himself three wounds\nin his mouth.\n\nBesides these there was one Captain Bragman, a very desperate fellow, and\nhe was captain over a band of those that threw firebrands, arrows, and\ndeath: he also received, by the hand of Captain Good-Hope at Eye-gate, a\nmortal wound in the breast.\n\nThere was, moreover, one Mr. Feeling; but he was no captain, but a great\nstickler to encourage Mansoul to rebellion.  He received a wound in the\neye by the hand of one of Boanerges’ soldiers, and had by the captain\nhimself been slain, but that he made a sudden retreat.\n\nBut I never saw Willbewill so daunted in all my life; he was not able to\ndo as he was wont, and some say that he also received a wound in the leg,\nand that some of the men in the Prince’s army have certainly seen him\nlimp as he afterwards walked on the wall.\n\nI shall not give you a particular account of the names of the soldiers\nthat were slain in the town, for many were maimed, and wounded, and\nslain; for when they saw that the posts of Ear-gate did shake, and\nEye-gate was well-nigh broken quite open, and also that their captains\nwere slain, this took away the hearts of many of the Diabolonians; they\nfell also by the force of the shot that were sent by the golden slings\ninto the midst of the town of Mansoul.\n\nOf the townsmen, there was one Love-no-Good; he was a townsman, but a\nDiabolonian; he also received his mortal wound in Mansoul, but he died\nnot very soon.\n\nMr. Ill-Pause also, who was the man that came along with Diabolus when at\nfirst he attempted the taking of Mansoul, he also received a grievous\nwound in the head; some say that his brain-pan was cracked.  This I have\ntaken notice of, that he was never after this able to do that mischief to\nMansoul as he had done in times past.  Also old Prejudice and Mr.\nAnything fled.\n\nNow, when the battle was over, the Prince commanded that yet once more\nthe white flag should be set upon Mount Gracious in sight of the town of\nMansoul, to show that yet Emmanuel had grace for the wretched town of\nMansoul.\n\nWhen Diabolus saw the white flag hung out again, and knowing that it was\nnot for him, but Mansoul, he cast in his mind to play another prank, to\nwit, to see if Emmanuel would raise his siege and begone, upon promise of\nreformation.  So he comes down to the gate one evening, a good while\nafter the sun was gone down, and calls to speak with Emmanuel, who\npresently came down to the gate, and Diabolus saith unto him:\n\n‘Forasmuch as thou makest it appear by thy white flag that thou art\nwholly given to peace and quiet, I thought meet to acquaint thee that we\nare ready to accept thereof upon terms which thou mayest admit.\n\n‘I know that thou art given to devotion, and that holiness pleaseth thee;\nyea, that thy great end in making a war upon Mansoul is, that it may be a\nholy habitation.  Well, draw off thy forces from the town, and I will\nbend Mansoul to thy bow.\n\n‘First, I will lay down all acts of hostility against thee, and will be\nwilling to become thy deputy, and will, as I have formerly been against\nthee, now serve thee in the town of Mansoul.  And more particularly,\n\n‘1. I will persuade Mansoul to receive thee for their Lord; and I know\nthat they will do it the sooner when they shall understand that I am thy\ndeputy.\n\n‘2. I will show them wherein they have erred, and that transgression\nstands in the way to life.\n\n‘3. I will show them the holy law unto which they must conform, even that\nwhich they have broken.\n\n‘4. I will press upon them the necessity of a reformation according to\nthy law.\n\n‘5. And, moreover, that none of these things may fail, I myself, at my\nown proper cost and charge, will set up and maintain a sufficient\nministry, besides lectures, in Mansoul.\n\n‘6. Thou shalt receive, as a token of our subjection to thee, year by\nyear, what thou shalt think fit to lay and levy upon us in token of our\nsubjection to thee.’\n\nThen said Emmanuel to him, ‘O full of deceit, how movable are thy ways!\nHow often hast thou changed and rechanged, if so be thou mightest still\nkeep possession of my Mansoul, though, as has been plainly declared\nbefore, I am the right heir thereof!  Often hast thou made thy proposals\nalready, nor is this last a whit better than they.  And failing to\ndeceive when thou showedst thyself in thy black, thou hast now\ntransformed thyself into an angel of light, and wouldst, to deceive, be\nnow as a minister of righteousness.\n\n‘But know thou, O Diabolus, that nothing must be regarded that thou canst\npropound, for nothing is done by thee but to deceive.  Thou neither hast\nconscience to God, nor love to the town of Mansoul; whence, then, should\nthese thy sayings arise but from sinful craft and deceit?  He that can of\nlist and will propound what he pleases, and that wherewith he may destroy\nthem that believe him, is to be abandoned, with all that he shall say.\nBut if righteousness be such a beauty-spot in thine eyes now, how is it\nthat wickedness was so closely stuck to by thee before?  But this is\nby-the-bye.\n\n‘Thou talkest now of a reformation in Mansoul, and that thou thyself, if\nI will please, wilt be at the head of that reformation; all the while\nknowing that the greatest proficiency that man can make in the law, and\nthe righteousness thereof, will amount to no more, for the taking away of\nthe curse from Mansoul, than just nothing at all; for a law being broken\nby Mansoul, that had before, upon a supposition of the breach thereof, a\ncurse pronounced against him for it of God, can never, by his obeying of\nthe law, deliver himself therefrom (to say nothing of what a reformation\nis like to be set up in Mansoul when the devil is become corrector of\nvice).  Thou knowest that all that thou hast now said in this matter is\nnothing but guile and deceit; and is, as it was the first, so is it the\nlast card that thou hast to play.  Many there be that do soon discern\nthee when thou showest them thy cloven foot; but in thy white, thy light,\nand in thy transformation, thou art seen but of a few.  But thou shalt\nnot do thus with my Mansoul, O Diabolus; for I do still love my Mansoul.\n\n‘Besides, I am not come to put Mansoul upon works to live thereby; should\nI do so, I should be like unto thee: but I am come that by me, and by\nwhat I have and shall do for Mansoul, they may to my Father be\nreconciled, though by their sin they have provoked him to anger, and\nthough by the law they cannot obtain mercy.\n\n‘Thou talkest of subjecting of this town to good, when none desireth it\nat thy hands.  I am sent by my Father to possess it myself, and to guide\nit by the skilfulness of my hands into such a conformity to him as shall\nbe pleasing in his sight.  I will therefore possess it myself; I will\ndispossess and cast thee out; I will set up mine own standard in the\nmidst of them; I will also govern them by new laws, new officers, new\nmotives, and new ways; yea, I will pull down this town, and build it\nagain; and it shall be as though it had not been, and it shall then be\nthe glory of the whole universe.’\n\nWhen Diabolus heard this, and perceived that he was discovered in all his\ndeceits, he was confounded, and utterly put to a nonplus; but having in\nhimself the fountain of iniquity, rage, and malice against both Shaddai\nand his Son, and the beloved town of Mansoul, what doth he but strengthen\nhimself what he could to give fresh battle to the noble Prince Emmanuel?\nSo, then, now we must have another fight before the town of Mansoul is\ntaken.  Come up, then, to the mountains, you that love to see military\nactions, and behold by both sides how the fatal blow is given, while one\nseeks to hold, and the other seeks to make himself master of the famous\ntown of Mansoul.\n\nDiabolus, therefore, having withdrawn himself from the wall to his force\nthat was in the heart of the town of Mansoul, Emmanuel also returned to\nthe camp; and both of them, after their divers ways, put themselves into\na posture fit to give battle one to another.\n\nDiabolus, as filled with despair of retaining in his hands the famous\ntown of Mansoul, resolved to do what mischief he could (if, indeed, he\ncould do any) to the army of the Prince and to the famous town of\nMansoul; for, alas! it was not the happiness of the silly town of Mansoul\nthat was designed by Diabolus, but the utter ruin and overthrow thereof,\nas now is enough in view.  Wherefore, he commands his officers that they\nshould then, when they see that they could hold the town no longer, do it\nwhat harm and mischief they could, rendering and tearing men, women, and\nchildren.  ‘For,’ said he, ‘we had better quite demolish the place, and\nleave it like a ruinous heap, than so leave it that it may be an\nhabitation for Emmanuel.’\n\nEmmanuel again, knowing that the next battle would issue in his being\nmade master of the place, gave out a royal commandment to all his\nofficers, high captains, and men of war, to be sure to show themselves\nmen of war against Diabolus and all Diabolonians; but favourable,\nmerciful, and meek to the old inhabitants of Mansoul.  ‘Bend, therefore,’\nsaid the noble Prince, ‘the hottest front of the battle against Diabolus\nand his men.’\n\nSo the day being come, the command was given, and the Prince’s men did\nbravely stand to their arms, and did, as before, bend their main force\nagainst Ear-gate and Eye-gate.  The word was then, ‘Mansoul is won!’ so\nthey made their assault upon the town.  Diabolus also, as fast as he\ncould, with the main of his power, made resistance from within; and his\nhigh lords and chief captains for a time fought very cruelly against the\nPrince’s army.\n\nBut after three or four notable charges by the Prince and his noble\ncaptains, Ear-gate was broken open, and the bars and bolts wherewith it\nwas used to be fast shut up against the Prince, were broken into a\nthousand pieces.  Then did the Prince’s trumpets sound, the captains\nshout, the town shake, and Diabolus retreat to his hold.  Well, when the\nPrince’s forces had broken open the gate, himself came up and did set his\nthrone in it; also he set his standard thereby, upon a mount that before\nby his men was cast up to place the mighty slings thereon.  The mount was\ncalled Mount Hear-well.  There, therefore, the Prince abode, to wit, hard\nby the going in at the gate.  He commanded also that the golden slings\nshould yet be played upon the town, especially against the castle,\nbecause for shelter thither was Diabolus retreated.  Now, from Ear-gate\nthe street was straight even to the house of Mr. Recorder that so was\nbefore Diabolus took the town; and hard by his house stood the castle,\nwhich Diabolus for a long time had made his irksome den.  The captains,\ntherefore, did quickly clear that street by the use of their slings, so\nthat way was made up to the heart of the town.  Then did the Prince\ncommand that Captain Boanerges, Captain Conviction, and Captain Judgment,\nshould forthwith march up the town to the old gentleman’s gate.  Then did\nthe captains in the most warlike manner enter into the town of Mansoul,\nand marching in with flying colours, they came up to the Recorder’s\nhouse, and that was almost as strong as was the castle.  Battering-rams\nthey took also with them, to plant against the castle gates.  When they\nwere come to the house of Mr. Conscience, they knocked, and demanded\nentrance.  Now, the old gentleman, not knowing as yet fully their design,\nkept his gates shut all the time of this fight.  Wherefore Boanerges\ndemanded entrance at his gates; and no man making answer, he gave it one\nstroke with the head of a ram, and this made the old gentleman shake, and\nhis house to tremble and totter.  Then came Mr. Recorder down to the\ngates, and, as he could, with quivering lips he asked who was there?\nBoanerges answered, ‘We are the captains and commanders of the great\nShaddai and of the blessed Emmanuel, his Son, and we demand possession of\nyour house for the use of our noble Prince.’  And with that the\nbattering-ram gave the gate another shake.  This made the old gentleman\ntremble the more, yet durst he not but open the gate: then the King’s\nforces marched in, namely, the three brave captains mentioned before.\nNow, the Recorder’s house was a place of much convenience for Emmanuel,\nnot only because it was near to the castle and strong, but also because\nit was large, and fronted the castle, the den where now Diabolus was, for\nhe was now afraid to come out of his hold.  As for Mr. Recorder, the\ncaptains carried it very reservedly to him; as yet he knew nothing of the\ngreat designs of Emmanuel, so that he did not know what judgment to make,\nnor what would be the end of such thundering beginnings.  It was also\npresently noised in the town how the Recorder’s house was possessed, his\nrooms taken up, and his palace made the seat of the war; and no sooner\nwas it noised abroad, but they took the alarm as warmly, and gave it out\nto others of his friends, and you know, as a snowball loses nothing by\nrolling, so in little time the whole town was possessed that they must\nexpect nothing from the Prince but destruction; and the ground of the\nbusiness was this, the Recorder was afraid, the Recorder trembled, and\nthe captains carried it strangely to the Recorder.  So many came to see,\nbut when they with their own eyes did behold the captains in the palace,\nand their battering-rams ever playing at the castle gates to beat them\ndown, they were riveted in their fears, and it made them all in amaze.\nAnd, as I said, the man of the house would increase all this; for whoever\ncame to him, or discoursed with him, nothing would he talk of, tell them,\nor hear, but that death and destruction now attended Mansoul.\n\n‘For,’ quoth the old gentleman, ‘you are all of you sensible that we all\nhave been traitors to that once despised, but now famously victorious and\nglorious Prince Emmanuel; for he now, as you see, doth not only lie in\nclose siege about us, but hath forced his entrance in at our gates.\nMoreover, Diabolus flees before him; and he hath, as you behold, made of\nmy house a garrison against the castle where he is.  I, for my part, have\ntransgressed greatly, and he that is clean, it is well for him.  But I\nsay I have transgressed greatly in keeping silence when I should have\nspoken, and in perverting justice when I should have executed the same.\nTrue, I have suffered something at the hand of Diabolus for taking part\nwith the laws of King Shaddai; but that, alas! what will that do? Will\nthat make compensation for the rebellions and treasons that I have done,\nand have suffered without gainsaying to be committed in the town of\nMansoul? Oh! I tremble to think what will be the end of this so dreadful\nand so ireful a beginning!’\n\nNow, while these brave captains were thus busy in the house of the old\nRecorder, Captain Execution was as busy in other parts of the town, in\nsecuring the back streets and the walls.  He also hunted the Lord\nWillbewill sorely; he suffered him not to rest in any corner; he pursued\nhim so hard that he drove his men from him, and made him glad to thrust\nhis head into a hole.  Also this mighty warrior did cut three of the Lord\nWillbewill’s officers down to the ground: one was old Mr. Prejudice, he\nthat had his crown cracked in the mutiny.  This man was made by Lord\nWillbewill keeper of the Ear-gate, and fell by the hand of Captain\nExecution.  There was also one Mr. Backward-to-all-but-naught, and he\nalso was one of Lord Willbewill’s officers, and was the captain of the\ntwo guns that once were mounted on the top of Ear-gate; he also was cut\ndown to the ground by the hands of Captain Execution.  Besides these two\nthere was another, a third, and his name was Captain Treacherous; a vile\nman this was, but one that Willbewill did put a great deal of confidence\nin; but him also did this Captain Execution cut down to the ground with\nthe rest.\n\nHe also made a very great slaughter among my Lord Willbewill’s soldiers,\nkilling many that were stout and sturdy, and wounding many that for\nDiabolus were nimble and active.  But all these were Diabolonians; there\nwas not a man, a native of Mansoul, hurt.\n\nOther feats of war were also likewise performed by other of the captains,\nas at Eye-gate, where Captain Good-Hope and Captain Charity had a charge,\nwas great execution done; for the Captain Good-Hope, with his own hands,\nslew one Captain Blindfold, the keeper of that gate.  This Blindfold was\ncaptain of a thousand men, and they were they that fought with mauls; he\nalso pursued his men, slew many, and wounded more, and made the rest hide\ntheir heads in corners.\n\nThere was also at that gate Mr. Ill-Pause, of whom you have heard before.\nHe was an old man, and had a beard that reached down to his girdle: the\nsame was he that was orator to Diabolus: he did much mischief in the town\nof Mansoul, and fell by the hand of Captain Good-Hope.\n\nWhat shall I say?  The Diabolonians in these days lay dead in every\ncorner, though too many yet were alive in Mansoul.\n\nNow, the old Recorder and my Lord Understanding, with some others of the\nchief of the town, to wit, such as knew they must stand and fall with the\nfamous town of Mansoul, came together upon a day, and after consultation\nhad, did jointly agree to draw up a petition, and to send it to Emmanuel,\nnow while he sat in the gate of Mansoul.  So they drew up their petition\nto Emmanuel, the contents whereof were these: That they, the old\ninhabitants of the now deplorable town of Mansoul, confessed their sin,\nand were sorry that they had offended his princely Majesty, and prayed\nthat he would spare their lives.\n\nUnto this petition he gave no answer at all, and that did trouble them\nyet so much the more.  Now, all this while the captains that were in the\nRecorder’s house were playing with the battering-rams at the gates of the\ncastle, to beat them down.  So after some time, labour, and travail, the\ngate of the castle that was called Impregnable was beaten open, and\nbroken into several splinters, and so a way made to go up to the hold in\nwhich Diabolus had hid himself.  Then were tidings sent down to Ear-gate,\nfor Emmanuel still abode there, to let him know that a way was made in at\nthe gates of the castle of Mansoul.  But, oh! how the trumpets at the\ntidings sounded throughout the Prince’s camp, for that now the war was so\nnear an end, and Mansoul itself of being set free.\n\nThen the Prince arose from the place where he was, and took with him such\nof his men of war as were fittest for that expedition, and marched up the\nstreet of Mansoul to the old Recorder’s house.\n\nNow, the Prince himself was clad all in armour of gold, and so he marched\nup the town with his standard borne before him; but he kept his\ncountenance much reserved all the way as he went, so that the people\ncould not tell how to gather to themselves love or hatred by his looks.\nNow, as he marched up the street, the townsfolk came out at every door to\nsee, and could not but be taken with his person and the glory thereof,\nbut wondered at the reservedness of his countenance; for as yet he spake\nmore to them by his actions and works than he did by words or smiles.\nBut also poor Mansoul, (as in such cases all are apt to do,) they\ninterpreted the carriage of Emmanuel to them as did Joseph’s brethren his\nto them, even all the quite contrary way.  ‘For,’ thought they, ‘if\nEmmanuel loved us, he would show it to us by word of carriage; but none\nof these he doth, therefore Emmanuel hates us.  Now, if Emmanuel hates\nus, then Mansoul shall be slain, then Mansoul shall become a dunghill.’\nThey knew that they had transgressed his Father’s law, and that against\nhim they had been in with Diabolus, his enemy.  They also knew that the\nPrince Emmanuel knew all this; for they were convinced that he was an\nangel of God, to know all things that are done in the earth; and this\nmade them think that their condition was miserable, and that the good\nPrince would make them desolate.\n\n‘And,’ thought they, ‘what time so fit to do this in as now, when he has\nthe bridle of Mansoul in his hand?’  And this I took special notice of,\nthat the inhabitants, notwithstanding all this, could not—no, they could\nnot, when they see him march through the town, but cringe, bow, bend, and\nwere ready to lick the dust of his feet.  They also wished a thousand\ntimes over that he would become their Prince and Captain, and would\nbecome their protection.  They would also one to another talk of the\ncomeliness of his person, and how much for glory and valour he\noutstripped the great ones of the world.  But, poor hearts, as to\nthemselves, their thoughts would chance, and go upon all manner of\nextremes.  Yea, through the working of them backward and forward, Mansoul\nbecame as a ball tossed, and as a rolling thing before the whirlwind.\n\nNow, when he was come to the castle gates, he commanded Diabolus to\nappear, and to surrender himself into his hands.  But, oh! how loath was\nthe beast to appear! how he stuck at it! how he shrank! how he cringed!\nyet out he came to the Prince.  Then Emmanuel commanded, and they took\nDiabolus and bound him fast in chains, the better to reserve him to the\njudgment that he had appointed for him.  But Diabolus stood up to entreat\nfor himself that Emmanuel would not send him into the deep, but suffer\nhim to depart out of Mansoul in peace.\n\nWhen Emmanuel had taken him and bound him in chains, he led him into the\nmarketplace, and there, before Mansoul, stripped him of his armour in\nwhich he boasted so much before.  This now was one of the acts of triumph\nof Emmanuel over his enemy; and all the while that the giant was\nstripping, the trumpets of the golden Prince did sound amain; the\ncaptains also shouted, and the soldiers did sing for joy.\n\nThen was Mansoul called upon to behold the beginning of Emmanuel’s\ntriumph over him in whom they so much had trusted, and of whom they so\nmuch had boasted in the days when he flattered them.\n\nThus having made Diabolus naked in the eyes of Mansoul, and before the\ncommanders of the Prince, in the next place, he commands that Diabolus\nshould be bound with chains to his chariot wheels.  Then leaving some of\nhis forces, to wit, Captain Boanerges and Captain Conviction, as a guard\nfor the castle-gates, that resistance might be made on his behalf, (if\nany that heretofore followed Diabolus should make an attempt to possess\nit,) he did ride in triumph over him quite through the town of Mansoul,\nand so out at and before the gate called Eye-gate, to the plain where his\ncamp did lie.\n\nBut you cannot think, unless you had been there, as I was, what a shout\nthere was in Emmanuel’s camp when they saw the tyrant bound by the hand\nof their noble Prince, and tied to his chariot wheels!\n\nAnd they said, ‘He hath led captivity captive, he hath spoiled\nprincipalities and powers.  Diabolus is subjected to the power of his\nsword, and made the object of all derision.’\n\nThose also that rode reformades, and that came down to see the battle,\nthey shouted with that greatness of voice, and sung with such melodious\nnotes, that they caused them that dwell in the highest orbs to open their\nwindows, put out their heads, and look to see the cause of that glory.\n\nThe townsmen also, so many of them as saw this sight, were, as it were,\nwhile they looked, betwixt the earth and the heavens.  True, they could\nnot tell what would be the issue of things as to them; but all things\nwere done in such excellent methods, and I cannot tell how, but things in\nthe management of them seemed to cast a smile towards the town, so that\ntheir eyes, their heads, their hearts, and their minds, and all that they\nhad, were taken and held while they observed Emmanuel’s order.\n\nSo, when the brave Prince had finished this part of his triumph over\nDiabolus his foe, he turned him up in the midst of his contempt and\nshame, having given him a charge no more to be a possessor of Mansoul.\nThen went he from Emmanuel, and out of the midst of his camp, to inherit\nthe parched places in a salt land, seeking rest, but finding none.\n\nNow, Captain Boanerges and Captain Conviction were, both of them, men of\nvery great majesty; their faces were like the faces of lions, and their\nwords like the roaring of the sea; and they still quartered in Mr.\nConscience’s house, of whom mention was made before.  When, therefore,\nthe high and mighty Prince had thus far finished his triumph over\nDiabolus, the townsmen had more leisure to view and to behold the actions\nof these noble captains.  But the captains carried it with that terror\nand dread in all that they did, (and you may be sure that they had\nprivate instructions so to do,) that they kept the town under continual\nheart-aching, and caused (in their apprehension) the well-being of\nMansoul for the future to hang in doubt before them, so that for some\nconsiderable time they neither knew what rest, or ease, or peace, or hope\nmeant.\n\nNor did the Prince himself as yet abide in the town of Mansoul, but in\nhis royal pavilion in the camp, and in the midst of his Father’s forces.\nSo, at a time convenient, he sent special orders to Captain Boanerges to\nsummons Mansoul, the whole of the townsmen, into the castle-yard, and\nthen and there, before their faces, to take my Lord Understanding, Mr.\nConscience, and that notable one, the Lord Willbewill, and put them all\nthree in ward, and that they should set a strong guard upon them there,\nuntil his pleasure concerning them was further known: the which orders,\nwhen the captains had put them in execution, made no small addition to\nthe fears of the town of Mansoul; for now, to their thinking, were their\nformer fears of the ruin of Mansoul confirmed.  Now, what death they\nshould die, and how long they should be in dying, was that which most\nperplexed their heads and hearts; yea, they were afraid that Emmanuel\nwould command them all into the deep, the place that the prince Diabolus\nwas afraid of, for they knew that they had deserved it.  Also to die by\nthe sword in the face of the town, and in the open way of disgrace, from\nthe hand of so good and so holy a prince, that, too, troubled them sore.\nThe town was also greatly troubled for the men that were committed to\nward, for that they were their stay and their guide, and for that they\nbelieved that, if those men were cut off, their execution would be but\nthe beginning of the ruin of the town of Mansoul.  Wherefore, what do\nthey, but, together with the men in prison, draw up a petition to the\nPrince, and sent it to Emmanuel by the hand of Mr. Would-live.  So he\nwent, and came to the Prince’s quarters, and presented the petition, the\nsum of which was this:\n\n‘Great and wonderful Potentate, victor over Diabolus, and conqueror of\nthe town of Mansoul, We, the miserable inhabitants of that most woful\ncorporation, do humbly beg that we may find favour in thy sight, and\nremember not against us former transgressions, nor yet the sins of the\nchief of our town: but spare us according to the greatness of thy mercy,\nand let us not die, but live in thy sight.  So shall we be willing to be\nthy servants, and, if thou shalt think fit, to gather our meat under thy\ntable.  Amen.’\n\nSo the petitioner went, as was said, with his petition to the Prince; and\nthe Prince took it at his hand, but sent him away with silence.  This\nstill afflicted the town of Mansoul; but yet, considering that now they\nmust either petition or die, for now they could not do anything else,\ntherefore they consulted again, and sent another petition; and this\npetition was much after the form and method of the former.\n\nBut when the petition was drawn up, By whom should they send it? was the\nnext question; for they would not send this by him by whom they sent the\nfirst, for they thought that the Prince had taken some offence at the\nmanner of his deportment before him: so they attempted to make Captain\nConviction their messenger with it; but he said that he neither durst nor\nwould petition Emmanuel for traitors, nor be to the Prince an advocate\nfor rebels.  ‘Yet withal,’ said he, ‘our Prince is good, and you may\nadventure to send it by the hand of one of your town, provided he went\nwith a rope about his head, and pleaded nothing but mercy.’\n\nWell, they made, through fear, their delays as long as they could, and\nlonger than delays were good; but fearing at last the dangerousness of\nthem, they thought, but with many a fainting in their minds, to send\ntheir petition by Mr. Desires-awake; so they sent for Mr. Desires-awake.\nNow he dwelt in a very mean cottage in Mansoul, and he came at his\nneighbour’s request.  So they told him what they had done, and what they\nwould do, concerning petitioning, and that they did desire of him that he\nwould go therewith to the Prince.\n\nThen said Mr. Desires-awake, ‘Why should not I do the best I can to save\nso famous a town as Mansoul from deserved destruction?’  They therefore\ndelivered the petition to him, and told him how he must address himself\nto the Prince, and wished him ten thousand good speeds.  So he comes to\nthe Prince’s pavilion, as the first, and asked to speak with his Majesty.\nSo word was carried to Emmanuel, and the Prince came out to the man.\nWhen Mr. Desires-awake saw the Prince, he fell flat with his face to the\nground, and cried out, ‘Oh that Mansoul might live before thee!’ and with\nthat he presented the petition; the which when the Prince had read, he\nturned away for a while and wept; but refraining himself, he turned again\nto the man, who all this while lay crying at his feet, as at the first,\nand said to him, ‘Go thy way to thy place, and I will consider of thy\nrequests.’\n\nNow, you may think that they of Mansoul that had sent him, what with\nguilt, and what with fear lest their petition should be rejected, could\nnot but look with many a long look, and that, too, with strange workings\nof heart, to see what would become of their petition.  At last they saw\ntheir messenger coming back.  So, when he was come, they asked him how he\nfared, what Emmanuel said, and what was become of the petition.  But he\ntold them that he would be silent till he came to the prison to my Lord\nMayor, my Lord Willbewill, and Mr. Recorder.  So he went forwards towards\nthe prison-house, where the men of Mansoul lay bound.  But, oh! what a\nmultitude flocked after, to hear what the messenger said.  So, when he\nwas come, and had shown himself at the gate of the prison, my Lord Mayor\nhimself looked as white as a clout; the Recorder also did quake.  But\nthey asked and said, ‘Come, good sir, what did the great Prince say to\nyou?’  Then said Mr. Desires-awake, ‘When I came to my Lord’s pavilion, I\ncalled, and he came forth.  So I fell prostrate at his feet, and\ndelivered to him my petition; for the greatness of his person, and the\nglory of his countenance, would not suffer me to stand upon my legs.\nNow, as he received the petition, I cried, “Oh that Mansoul might live\nbefore thee!”  So, when for a while he had looked thereon, he turned him\nabout, and said to his servant, “Go thy way to thy place again, and I\nwill consider of thy requests.”’  The messenger added, moreover, and\nsaid, ‘The Prince to whom you sent me is such a one for beauty and glory,\nthat whoso sees him must both love and fear him.  I, for my part, can do\nno less; but I know not what will be the end of these things.’\n\nAt this answer they were all at a stand, both they in prison, and they\nthat followed the messenger thither to hear the news; nor knew they what,\nor what manner of interpretation to put upon what the Prince had said.\nNow, when the prison was cleared of the throng, the prisoners among\nthemselves began to comment upon Emmanuel’s words.  My Lord Mayor said,\nthat the answer did not look with a rugged face; but Willbewill said that\nit betokened evil; and the Recorder, that it was a messenger of death.\nNow, they that were left, and that stood behind, and so could not so well\nhear what the prisoners said, some of them catched hold of one piece of a\nsentence, and some on a bit of another; some took hold of what the\nmessenger said, and some of the prisoners’ judgment thereon; so none had\nthe right understanding of things.  But you cannot imagine what work\nthese people made, and what a confusion there was in Mansoul now.\n\nFor presently they that had heard what was said flew about the town, one\ncrying one thing, and another the quite contrary; and both were sure\nenough they told true; for they did hear, they said, with their ears what\nwas said, and therefore could not be deceived.  One would say, ‘We must\nall be killed;’ another would say, ‘We must all be saved;’ and a third\nwould say that the Prince would not be concerned with Mansoul; and a\nfourth, that the prisoners must be suddenly put to death.  And, as I\nsaid, every one stood to it that he told his tale the rightest, and that\nall others but he were out.  Wherefore Mansoul had now molestation upon\nmolestation, nor could any man know on what to rest the sole of his foot;\nfor one would go by now, and as he went, if he heard his neighbour tell\nhis tale, to be sure he would tell the quite contrary, and both would\nstand in it that he told the truth.  Nay, some of them had got this story\nby the end, that the Prince did intend to put Mansoul to the sword.  And\nnow it began to be dark, wherefore poor Mansoul was in sad perplexity all\nthat night until the morning.\n\nBut, so far as I could gather by the best information that I could get,\nall this hubbub came through the words that the Recorder said when he\ntold them that, in his judgment, the Prince’s answer was a messenger of\ndeath.  It was this that fired the town, and that began the fright in\nMansoul; for Mansoul in former times did use to count that Mr. Recorder\nwas a seer, and that his sentence was equal to the best of orators; and\nthus was Mansoul a terror to itself.\n\nAnd now did they begin to feel what were the effects of stubborn\nrebellion, and unlawful resistance against their Prince.  I say, they now\nbegan to feel the effects thereof by guilt and fear, that now had\nswallowed them up; and who more involved in the one but they that were\nmost in the other, to wit, the chief of the town of Mansoul?\n\nTo be brief: when the fame of the fright was out of the town, and the\nprisoners had a little recovered themselves, they take to themselves some\nheart, and think to petition the Prince for life again.  So they did draw\nup a third petition, the contents whereof were these:—\n\n‘Prince Emmanuel the Great, Lord of all worlds, and Master of mercy, we,\nthy poor, wretched, miserable, dying town of Mansoul, do confess unto thy\ngreat and glorious Majesty that we have sinned against thy Father and\nthee, and are no more worthy to be called thy Mansoul, but rather to be\ncast into the pit.  If thou wilt slay us, we have deserved it.  If thou\nwilt condemn us to the deep, we cannot but say thou art righteous.  We\ncannot complain whatever thou dost, or however thou carriest it towards\nus.  But, oh! let mercy reign, and let it be extended to us!  Oh! let\nmercy take hold upon us, and free us from our transgressions, and we will\nsing of thy mercy and of thy judgment.  Amen.’\n\nThis petition, when drawn up, was designed to be sent to the Prince as\nthe first.  But who should carry it?—that was the question.  Some said,\n‘Let him do it that went with the first,’ but others thought not good to\ndo that, and that because he sped no better.  Now, there was an old man\nin the town, and his name was Mr. Good-Deed; a man that bare only the\nname, but had nothing of the nature of the thing.  Now, some were for\nsending him; but the Recorder was by no means for that.  ‘For,’ said he,\n‘we now stand in need of, and are pleading for mercy: wherefore, to send\nour petition by a man of this name, will seem to cross the petition\nitself.  Should we make Mr. Good-Deed our messenger, when our petition\ncries for mercy?\n\n‘Besides,’ quoth the old gentleman, ‘should the Prince now, as he\nreceives the petition, ask him, and say, “What is thy name?” as nobody\nknows but he will, and he should say, “Old Good-Deed,” what, think you,\nwould Emmanuel say but this?  “Ay! is old Good-Deed yet alive in Mansoul?\nthen let old Good-Deed save you from your distresses.”  And if he says\nso, I am sure we are lost; nor can a thousand of old Good-Deeds save\nMansoul.’\n\nAfter the Recorder had given in his reasons why old Good-Deed should not\ngo with this petition to Emmanuel, the rest of the prisoners and chief of\nMansoul opposed it also, and so old Good-Deed was laid aside, and they\nagreed to send Mr. Desires-awake again.  So they sent for him, and\ndesired him that he would a second time go with their petition to the\nPrince, and he readily told them he would.  But they bid him that in\nanywise he should take heed that in no word or carriage he gave offence\nto the Prince; ‘For by doing so, for ought we can tell, you may bring\nMansoul into utter destruction,’ said they.\n\nNow Mr. Desires-awake, when he saw that he must go on this errand,\nbesought that they would grant that Mr. Wet-Eyes might go with him.  Now\nthis Mr. Wet-Eyes was a near neighbour of Mr. Desires, a poor man, a man\nof a broken spirit, yet one that could speak well to a petition; so they\ngranted that he should go with him.  Wherefore, they address themselves\nto their business: Mr. Desires put a rope upon his head, and Mr. Wet-Eyes\nwent with his hands wringing together.  Thus they went to the Prince’s\npavilion.\n\nNow, when they went to petition this third time, they were not without\nthoughts that, by often coming, they might be a burden to the Prince.\nWherefore, when they were come to the door of his pavilion, they first\nmade their apology for themselves, and for their coming to trouble\nEmmanuel so often; and they said, that they came not hither to-day for\nthat they delighted in being troublesome, or for that they delighted to\nhear themselves talk, but for that necessity caused them to come to his\nMajesty.  They could, they said, have no rest day nor night because of\ntheir transgressions against Shaddai and against Emmanuel, his Son.  They\nalso thought that some misbehaviour of Mr. Desires-awake the last time\nmight give distaste to his Highness, and so cause that he returned from\nso merciful a Prince empty, and without countenance.  So, when they had\nmade this apology, Mr. Desires-awake cast himself prostrate upon the\nground, as at the first, at the feet of the mighty Prince, saying, ‘Oh!\nthat Mansoul might live before thee!’ and so he delivered his petition.\nThe Prince then, having read the petition, turned aside awhile as before,\nand coming again to the place where the petitioner lay on the ground, he\ndemanded what his name was, and of what esteem in the account of Mansoul,\nfor that he, above all the multitude in Mansoul, should be sent to him\nupon such an errand.  Then said the man to the Prince, ‘Oh let not my\nLord be angry; and why inquirest thou after the name of such a dead do—as\nI am?  Pass by, I pray thee, and take not notice of who I am, because\nthere is, as thou very well knowest, so great a disproportion between me\nand thee.  Why the townsmen chose to send me on this errand to my Lord is\nbest known to themselves, but it could not be for that they thought that\nI had favour with my Lord.  For my part, I am out of charity with myself;\nwho, then, should be in love with me?  Yet live I would, and so would I\nthat my townsmen should; and because both they and myself are guilty of\ngreat transgressions, therefore they have sent me, and I am come in their\nnames to beg of my Lord for mercy.  Let it please thee, therefore, to\nincline to mercy; but ask not what thy servants are.’\n\nThen said the Prince, ‘And what is he that is become thy companion in\nthis so weighty a matter?’  So Mr. Desires told Emmanuel that he was a\npoor neighbour of his, and one of his most intimate associates.  ‘And his\nname,’ said he, ‘may it please your most excellent Majesty, is Wet-Eyes,\nof the town of Mansoul, I know that there are many of that name that are\nnaught; but I hope it will be no offence to my Lord that I have brought\nmy poor neighbour with me.’\n\nThen Mr. Wet-Eyes fell on his face to the ground, and made this apology\nfor his coming with his neighbour to his Lord:—\n\n‘O, my Lord,’ quoth he, ‘what I am I know not myself, nor whether my name\nbe feigned or true, especially when I begin to think what some have said,\nnamely, That this name was given me because Mr. Repentance was my father.\nGood men have bad children, and the sincere do oftentimes beget\nhypocrites.  My mother also called me by this name from the cradle; but\nwhether because of the moistness of my brain, or because of the softness\nof my heart, I cannot tell.  I see dirt in mine own tears, and filthiness\nin the bottom of my prayers.  But I pray thee (and all this while the\ngentleman wept) that thou wouldest not remember against us our\ntransgressions, nor take offence at the unqualifiedness of thy servants,\nbut mercifully pass by the sin of Mansoul, and refrain from the\nglorifying of thy grace no longer.’\n\nSo at his bidding they arose, and both stood trembling before him, and he\nspake to them to this purpose:—\n\n‘The town of Mansoul hath grievously rebelled against my Father, in that\nthey have rejected him from being their King, and did choose to\nthemselves for their captain a liar, a murderer, and a runagate slave.\nFor this Diabolus, your pretended prince, though once so highly accounted\nof by you, made rebellion against my Father and me, even in our palace\nand highest court there, thinking to become a prince and king.  But being\nthere timely discovered and apprehended, and for his wickedness bound in\nchains, and separated to the pit with those that were his companions, he\noffered himself to you, and you have received him.\n\n‘Now this is, and for a long time hath been, a high affront to my Father;\nwherefore my Father sent to you a powerful army to reduce you to your\nobedience.  But you know how these men, their captains and their\ncounsels, were esteemed of you, and what they received at your hand.  You\nrebelled against them, you shut your gates upon them, you bid them\nbattle, you fought them, and fought for Diabolus against them.  So they\nsent to my Father for more power, and I, with my men, are come to subdue\nyou.  But as you treated the servants, so you treated their Lord.  You\nstood up in hostile manner against me, you shut up your gates against me,\nyou turned the deaf ear to me, and resisted as long as you could; but now\nI have made a conquest of you.  Did you cry me mercy so long as you had\nhopes that you might prevail against me?  But now I have taken the town,\nyou cry; but why did you not cry before, when the white flag of my mercy,\nthe red flag of justice, and the black flag that threatened execution,\nwere set up to cite you to it?  Now I have conquered your Diabolus, you\ncome to me for favour; but why did you not help me against the mighty?\nYet I will consider your petition, and will answer it so as will be for\nmy glory.\n\n‘Go, bid Captain Boanerges and Captain Conviction bring the prisoners out\nto me into the camp to-morrow, and say you to Captain Judgment and\nCaptain Execution, “Stay you in the castle, and take good heed to\nyourselves that you keep all quiet in Mansoul until you shall hear\nfurther from me.”’  And with that he turned himself from them, and went\ninto his royal pavilion again.\n\nSo the petitioners, having received this answer from the Prince,\nreturned, as at the first, to go to their companions again.  But they had\nnot gone far, but thoughts began to work in their minds that no mercy as\nyet was intended by the Prince to Mansoul.  So they went to the place\nwhere the prisoners lay bound; but these workings of mind about what\nwould become of Mansoul had such strong power over them, that by that\nthey were come unto them that sent them, they were scarce able to deliver\ntheir message.\n\nBut they came at length to the gates of the town, (now the townsmen with\nearnestness were waiting for their return,) where many met them, to know\nwhat answer was made to the petition.  Then they cried out to those that\nwere sent, ‘What news from the Prince? and what hath Emmanuel said?’  But\nthey said that they must, as afore, go up to the prison, and there\ndeliver their message.  So away they went to the prison, with a multitude\nat their heels.  Now, when they were come to the gates of the prison,\nthey told the first part of Emmanuel’s speech to the prisoners, to wit,\nhow he reflected upon their disloyalty to his Father and himself, and how\nthey had chosen and closed with Diabolus, had fought for him, hearkened\nto him, and been ruled by him; but had despised him and his men.  This\nmade the prisoners look pale; but the messengers proceeded and said, ‘He,\nthe Prince, said, moreover, that yet he would consider your petition, and\ngive such answer thereto as would stand with his glory.’  And as these\nwords were spoken, Mr. Wet-Eyes gave a great sigh.  At this they were all\nof them struck into their dumps, and could not tell what to say: fear\nalso possessed them in a marvellous manner, and death seemed to sit upon\nsome of their eyebrows.  Now, there was in the company a notable,\nsharp-witted fellow, a mean man of estate, and his name was old\nInquisitive.  This man asked the petitioners if they had told out every\nwhit of what Emmanuel said, and they answered, ‘Verily, no.’  Then said\nInquisitive, ‘I thought so, indeed.  Pray, what was it more that he said\nunto you?’  Then they paused awhile; but at last they brought out all,\nsaying, ‘The Prince bade us bid Captain Boanerges and Captain Conviction\nbring the prisoners down to him to-morrow; and that Captain Judgment and\nCaptain Execution should take charge of the castle and town till they\nshould hear further from him.  They said also that when the Prince had\ncommanded them thus to do, he immediately turned his back upon them, and\nwent into his royal pavilion.\n\nBut, oh! how this return, and specially this last clause of it, that the\nprisoners must go out to the Prince into the camp, brake all their loins\nin pieces!  Wherefore, with one voice they set up a cry that reached up\nto the heavens.  This done, each of the three prepared himself to die;\n(and the Recorder said unto them, ‘This was the thing that I feared;’)\nfor they concluded that to-morrow, by that the sun went down, they should\nbe tumbled out of the world.  The whole town also counted of no other,\nbut that, in their time and order, they must all drink of the same cup.\nWherefore the town of Mansoul spent that night in mourning, and sackcloth\nand ashes.  The prisoners also, when the time was come for them to go\ndown before the Prince, dressed themselves in mourning attire, with ropes\nupon their heads.  The whole town of Mansoul also showed themselves upon\nthe wall, all clad in mourning weeds, if, perhaps, the Prince with the\nsight thereof might be moved with compassion.  But, oh! how the\nbusy-bodies that were in the town of Mansoul did now concern themselves!\nThey did run here and there through the streets of the town by companies,\ncrying out as they ran in tumultuous wise, one after one manner, and\nanother the quite contrary, to the almost utter distraction of Mansoul.\n\nWell, the time is come that the prisoners must go down to the camp, and\nappear before the Prince.  And thus was the manner of their going down:\nCaptain Boanerges went with a guard before them, and Captain Conviction\ncame behind, and the prisoners went down, bound in chains, in the midst.\nSo I say, the prisoners went in the midst, and the guard went with flying\ncolours behind and before, but the prisoners went with drooping spirits.\n\nOr, more particularly, thus: The prisoners went down all in mourning:\nthey put ropes upon themselves; they went on, smiting themselves on the\nbreasts, but durst not lift up their eyes to heaven.  Thus they went out\nat the gate of Mansoul, till they came into the midst of the Prince’s\narmy, the sight and glory of which did greatly heighten their affliction.\nNor could they now longer forbear, but cry out aloud, ‘O unhappy men!  O\nwretched men of Mansoul!’  Their chains, still mixing their dolorous\nnotes with the cries of the prisoners, made the noise more lamentable.\n\nSo, when they were come to the door of the Prince’s pavilion, they cast\nthemselves prostrate upon the place; then one went in and told his Lord\nthat the prisoners were come down.  The Prince then ascended a throne of\nstate, and sent for the prisoners in; who, when they came, did tremble\nbefore him, also they covered their faces with shame.  Now, as they drew\nnear to the place where he sat, they threw themselves down before him.\nThen said the Prince to the Captain Boanerges, ‘Bid the prisoners stand\nupon their feet.’  Then they stood trembling before him, and he said,\n‘Are you the men that heretofore were the servants of Shaddai?’  And they\nsaid, ‘Yes, Lord, yes.’  Then said the Prince again, ‘Are you the men\nthat did suffer yourselves to be corrupted and defiled by that abominable\none, Diabolus?’  And they said, ‘We did more than suffer it, Lord; for we\nchose it of our own mind.’  The Prince asked further, saying, ‘Could you\nhave been content that your slavery should have continued under his\ntyranny as long as you had lived?’  Then said the prisoners, ‘Yes, Lord,\nyes; for his ways were pleasing to our flesh, and we were grown aliens to\na better state.’—‘And did you,’ said he, ‘when I came up against this\ntown of Mansoul, heartily wish that I might not have the victory over\nyou?’—‘Yes, Lord, yes,’ said they.  Then said the Prince, ‘And what\npunishment is it, think you, that you deserve at my hand, for these and\nother your high and mighty sins?’—And they said, ‘Both death and the\ndeep, Lord; for we have deserved no less.’  He asked again if they had\naught to say for themselves why the sentence, that they confessed that\nthey had deserved, should not be passed upon them?  And they said, ‘We\ncan say nothing, Lord: thou art just, for we have sinned.’  Then said the\nPrince, ‘And for what are those ropes on your heads?’  The prisoners\nanswered, ‘These ropes are to bind us withal to the place of execution,\nif mercy be not pleasing in thy sight.’  So he further asked if all the\nmen in the town of Mansoul were in this confession, as they?  And they\nanswered, ‘All the natives, Lord; but for the Diabolonians that came into\nour town when the tyrant got possession of us, we can say nothing for\nthem.’\n\nThen the Prince commanded that a herald should be called, and that he\nshould, in the midst and throughout the camp of Emmanuel, proclaim, and\nthat with sound of trumpet, that the Prince, the Son of Shaddai, had, in\nhis Father’s name, and for his Father’s glory, gotten a perfect conquest\nand victory over Mansoul; and that the prisoners should follow him, and\nsay Amen.  So, this was done as he had commanded.  And presently the\nmusic that was in the upper region sounded melodiously, the captains that\nwere in the camp shouted, and the soldiers did sing songs of triumph to\nthe Prince; the colours waved in the wind, and great joy was everywhere,\nonly it was wanting as yet in the hearts of the men of Mansoul.\n\nThen the Prince called for the prisoners to come and to stand again\nbefore him, and they came and stood trembling.  And he said unto them,\n‘The sins, trespasses, iniquities, that you, with the whole town of\nMansoul, have from time to time committed against my Father and me, I\nhave power and commandment from my Father to forgive to the town of\nMansoul, and do forgive you accordingly.’  And having so said, he gave\nthem, written in parchment, and sealed with seven seals, a large and\ngeneral pardon, commanding my Lord Mayor, my Lord Willbewill, and Mr.\nRecorder, to proclaim and cause it to be proclaimed to-morrow, by that\nthe sun is up, throughout the whole town of Mansoul.\n\nMoreover, the Prince stripped the prisoners of their mourning weeds, and\ngave them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment\nof praise for the spirit of heaviness.\n\nThen he gave to each of the three jewels of gold and precious stones, and\ntook away their ropes, and put chains of gold about their necks, and\near-rings in their ears.  Now, the prisoners, when they did hear the\ngracious words of Prince Emmanuel, and had beheld all that was done unto\nthem, fainted almost quite away; for the grace, the benefit, the pardon,\nwas sudden, glorious, and so big, that they were not able, without\nstaggering, to stand up under it.  Yea, my Lord Willbewill swooned\noutright; but the Prince stepped to him, put his everlasting arms under\nhim, embraced him, kissed him, and bid him be of good cheer, for all\nshould be performed according to his word.  He also did kiss, and\nembrace, and smile upon the other two that were Willbewill’s companions,\nsaying, ‘Take these as further tokens of my love, favour, and compassions\nto you; and I charge you that you, Mr. Recorder, tell in the town of\nMansoul what you have heard and seen.’\n\nThen were their fetters broken to pieces before their faces, and cast\ninto the air, and their steps were enlarged under them.  Then they fell\ndown at the feet of the Prince, and kissed his feet, and wetted them with\ntears: also they cried out with a mighty strong voice, saying, ‘Blessed\nbe the glory of the Lord from this place.’  So they were bid rise up, and\ngo to the town, and tell to Mansoul what the Prince had done.  He\ncommanded also that one with a pipe and tabor should go and play before\nthem all the way into the town of Mansoul.  Then was fulfilled what they\nnever looked for, and they were made to possess that which they never\ndreamed of.\n\nThe Prince also called for the noble Captain Credence, and commanded that\nhe and some of his officers should march before the noble men of Mansoul\nwith flying colours into the town.  He gave also unto Captain Credence a\ncharge, that about that time that the Recorder did read the general\npardon in the town of Mansoul, that at that very time he should with\nflying colours march in at Eye-gate with his ten thousands at his feet\nand that he should so go until he came by the high street of the town, up\nto the castle gates, and that himself should take possession thereof\nagainst his Lord came thither.  He commanded, moreover, that he should\nbid Captain Judgment and Captain Execution to leave the stronghold to\nhim, and to withdraw from Mansoul, and to return into the camp with speed\nunto the Prince.\n\nAnd now was the town of Mansoul also delivered from the terror of the\nfirst four captains and their men.\n\nWell, I told you before how the prisoners were entertained by the noble\nPrince Emmanuel, and how they behaved themselves before him, and how he\nsent them away to their home with pipe and tabor going before them.  And\nnow you must think that those of the town that had all this while waited\nto hear of their death, could not but be exercised with sadness of mind,\nand with thoughts that pricked like thorns.  Nor could their thoughts be\nkept to any one point; the wind blew with them all this while at great\nuncertainties; yea, their hearts were like a balance that had been\ndisquieted with a shaking hand.  But at last, as they with many a long\nlook looked over the wall of Mansoul, they thought that they saw some\nreturning to the town; and thought again, Who should they be, too?  Who\nshould they be?  At last they discerned that they were the prisoners: but\ncan you imagine how their hearts were surprised with wonder, specially\nwhen they perceived also in what equipage and with what honour they were\nsent home.  They went down to the camp in black, but they came back to\nthe town in white; they went down to the camp in ropes, they came back in\nchains of gold; they went down to the camp with their feet in fetters,\nbut came back with their steps enlarged under them; they went also to the\ncamp looking for death, but they came back from thence with assurance of\nlife; they went down to the camp with heavy hearts, but came back again\nwith pipe and tabor playing before them.  So as soon as they were come to\nEye-gate, the poor and tottering town of Mansoul adventured to give a\nshout; and they gave such a shout as made the captains in the Prince’s\narmy leap at the sound thereof.  Alas! for them, poor hearts! who could\nblame them? since their dead friends were come to life again; for it was\nto them as life from the dead to see the ancients of the town of Mansoul\nshine in such splendour.  They looked for nothing but the axe and the\nblock; but, behold, joy and gladness, comfort and consolation, and such\nmelodious notes attending them that was sufficient to make a sick man\nwell.\n\nSo, when they came up, they saluted each other with, ‘Welcome, welcome!\nand blessed be he that has spared you!’  They added also, ‘We see it is\nwell with you; but how must it go with the town of Mansoul?  And will it\ngo well with the town of Mansoul?’ said they.  Then answered them the\nRecorder and my Lord Mayor, ‘Oh! tidings! glad tidings! good tidings of\ngood, and of great joy to poor Mansoul!’  Then they gave another shout,\nthat made the earth to ring again.  After this, they inquired yet more\nparticularly how things went in the camp, and what message they had from\nEmmanuel to the town.  So they told them all passages that had happened\nto them at the camp, and everything that the Prince did to them.  This\nmade Mansoul wonder at the wisdom and grace of the Prince Emmanuel.  Then\nthey told them what they had received at his hands for the whole town of\nMansoul, and the Recorder delivered it in these words: ‘PARDON, PARDON,\nPARDON for Mansoul! and this shall Mansoul know to-morrow!’  Then he\ncommanded, and they went and summoned Mansoul to meet together in the\nmarket-place to-morrow, then to hear their general pardon read.\n\nBut who can think what a turn, what a change, what an alteration this\nhint of things did make in the countenance of the town of Mansoul!  No\nman of Mansoul could sleep that night for joy; in every house there was\njoy and music, singing and making merry: telling and hearing of Mansoul’s\nhappiness was then all that Mansoul had to do; and this was the burden of\nall their song: ‘Oh! more of this at the rising of the sun! more of this\nto-morrow!’  ‘Who thought yesterday,’ would one say, ‘that this day would\nhave been such a day to us?  And who thought, that saw our prisoners go\ndown in irons, that they would have returned in chains of gold?  Yea,\nthey that judged themselves as they went to be judged of their judge,\nwere by his mouth acquitted, not for that they were innocent, but of the\nPrince’s mercy, and sent home with pipe and tabor.  But is this the\ncommon custom of princes? Do they use to show such kind of favours to\ntraitors?  No; this is only peculiar to Shaddai, and unto Emmanuel, his\nSon!’\n\nNow morning drew on apace; wherefore the Lord Mayor, the Lord Willbewill,\nand Mr. Recorder came down to the market-place at the time that the\nPrince had appointed, where the townsfolk were waiting for them: and when\nthey came, they came in that attire, and in that glory that the Prince\nhad put them into the day before, and the street was lightened with their\nglory.  So the Mayor, Recorder, and my Lord Willbewill drew down to\nMouth-gate, which was at the lower end of the market-place, because that\nof old time was the place where they used to read public matters.\nThither, therefore, they came in their robes, and their tabrets went\nbefore them.  Now, the eagerness of the people to know the full of the\nmatter was great.\n\nThen the Recorder stood up upon his feet, and, first beckoning with his\nhand for silence, he read out with a loud voice the pardon.  But when he\ncame to these words: ‘The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious,\npardoning iniquity, transgressions, and sins, and to them all manner of\nsin and blasphemy shall be forgiven,’ etc., they could not forbear\nleaping for joy.  For this you must know, that there was conjoined\nherewith every man’s name in Mansoul; also the seals of the pardon made a\nbrave show.\n\nWhen the Recorder had made an end of reading the pardon, the townsmen ran\nup upon the walls of the town, and leaped and skipped thereon for joy,\nand bowed themselves seven times with their faces toward Emmanuel’s\npavilion, and shouted out aloud for joy, and said, ‘Let Emmanuel live for\never!’  Then order was given to the young men in Mansoul that they should\nring the bells for joy.  So the bells did ring, and the people sing, and\nthe music go in every house in Mansoul.\n\nWhen the Prince had sent home the three prisoners of Mansoul with joy,\nand pipe and tabor, he commanded his captains, with all the field\nofficers and soldiers throughout his army, to be ready in that morning,\nthat the Recorder should read the pardon in Mansoul, to do his further\npleasure.  So the morning, as I have showed, being come, just as the\nRecorder had made an end of reading the pardon, Emmanuel commanded that\nall the trumpets in the camp should sound, that the colours should be\ndisplayed, half of them upon Mount Gracious, and half of them upon Mount\nJustice.  He commanded also that all the captains should show themselves\nin all their harness, and that the soldiers should shout for joy.  Nor\nwas Captain Credence, though in the castle, silent in such a day; but he,\nfrom the top of the hold, showed himself with sound of trumpet to Mansoul\nand to the Prince’s camp.\n\nThus have I showed you the manner and way that Emmanuel took to recover\nthe town of Mansoul from under the hand and power of the tyrant Diabolus.\n\nNow, when the Prince had completed these, the outward ceremonies of his\njoy, he again commanded that his captains and soldiers should show unto\nMansoul some feats of war: so they presently addressed themselves to this\nwork.  But oh! with what agility, nimbleness, dexterity, and bravery did\nthese military men discover their skill in feats of war to the now gazing\ntown of Mansoul!\n\nThey marched, they counter-marched; they opened to the right and left;\nthey divided and subdivided; they closed, they wheeled, made good their\nfront and rear with their right and left wings, and twenty things more,\nwith that aptness, and then were all as the were again, that they\ntook—yea, ravished, the hearts that were in Mansoul to behold it.  But\nadd to this, the handling of their arms, the managing of their weapons of\nwar, were marvellously taking to Mansoul and me.\n\nWhen this action was over, the whole town of Mansoul came out as one man\nto the Prince in the camp to thank him, and praise him for his abundant\nfavour, and to beg that it would please his grace to come unto Mansoul\nwith his men, and there to take up their quarters for ever: and this they\ndid in most humble manner, bowing themselves seven times to the ground\nbefore him.  Then said he, ‘All peace be to you.’ So the town came nigh,\nand touched with the hand the top of his golden sceptre; and they said,\n‘Oh! that the Prince Emmanuel, with his captains and men of war, would\ndwell in Mansoul for ever; and that his battering-rams and slings might\nbe lodged in her for the use and service of the Prince, and for the help\nand strength of Mansoul.  For,’ said they, ‘we have room for thee, we\nhave room for thy men, we have also room for thy weapons of war, and a\nplace to make a magazine for thy carriages.  Do it, Emmanuel, and thou\nshalt be King and Captain in Mansoul for ever.  Yea, govern thou also\naccording to all the desire of thy soul, and make thou governors and\nprinces under thee of thy captains and men of war, and we will become thy\nservants, and thy laws shall be our direction.’\n\nThey added, moreover, and prayed his Majesty to consider thereof; ‘for,’\nsaid they, ‘if now, after all this grace bestowed upon us, thy miserable\ntown of Mansoul, thou shouldest withdraw, thou and thy captains, from us,\nthe town of Mansoul will die.  Yea,’ said they, ‘our blessed Emmanuel, if\nthou shouldest depart from us now, now thou hast done so much good for\nus, and showed so much mercy unto us, what will follow but that our joy\nwill be as if it had not been, and our enemies will a second time come\nupon us with more rage than at the first?  Wherefore, we beseech thee, O\nthou, the desire of our eyes, and the strength and life of our poor town,\naccept of this motion that now we have made unto our Lord, and come and\ndwell in the midst of us, and let us be thy people.  Besides, Lord, we do\nnot know but that to this day many Diabolonians may be yet lurking in the\ntown of Mansoul, and they will betray us, when thou shalt leave us, into\nthe hand of Diabolus again; and who knows what designs, plots, or\ncontrivances have passed betwixt them about these things already?  Loath\nwe are to fall again into his horrible hands.  Wherefore, let it please\nthee to accept of our palace for thy place of residence, and of the\nhouses of the best men in our town for the reception of thy soldiers and\ntheir furniture.’\n\nThen said the Prince, ‘If I come to your town, will you suffer me further\nto prosecute that which is in mine heart against mine enemies and\nyours?—yea, will you help me in such undertakings?’\n\nThey answered, ‘We know not what we shall do; we did not think once that\nwe should have been such traitors to Shaddai as we have proved to be.\nWhat, then, shall we say to our Lord?  Let him put no trust in his\nsaints; let the Prince dwell in our castle, and make of our town a\ngarrison; let him set his noble captains and his warlike soldiers over\nus; yea, let him conquer us with his love, and overcome us with his\ngrace, and then surely shall he be but with us, and help us, as he was\nand did that morning that our pardon was read unto us.  We shall comply\nwith this our Lord, and with his ways, and fall in with his word against\nthe mighty.\n\n‘One word more, and thy servants have done, and in this will trouble our\nLord no more.  We know not the depth of the wisdom of thee, our Prince.\nWho could have thought, that had been ruled by his reason, that so much\nsweet as we do now enjoy should have come out of those bitter trials\nwherewith we were tried at the first!  But, Lord, let light go before,\nand let love come after: yea, take us by the hand, and lead us by thy\ncounsels, and let this always abide upon us, that all things shall be the\nbest for thy servants, and come to our Mansoul, and do as it pleaseth\nthee.  Or, Lord, come to our Mansoul, do what thou wilt, so thou keepest\nus from sinning, and makest us serviceable to thy Majesty.’\n\nThen said the Prince to the town of Mansoul again, ‘Go, return to your\nhouses in peace.  I will willingly in this comply with your desires; I\nwill remove my royal pavilion, I will draw up my forces before Eye-gate\nto-morrow, and so will march forwards into the town of Mansoul.  I will\npossess myself of your castle of Mansoul, and will set my soldiers over\nyou: yea, I will yet do things in Mansoul that cannot be paralleled in\nany nation, country, or kingdom under heaven.’  Then did the men of\nMansoul give a shout, and returned unto their houses in peace; they also\ntold to their kindred and friends the good that Emmanuel had promised to\nMansoul.  ‘And to-morrow,’ said they, ‘he will march into our town, and\ntake up his dwelling, he and his men, in Mansoul.’\n\nThen went out the inhabitants of the town of Mansoul with haste to the\ngreen trees and to the meadows, to gather boughs and flowers, therewith\nto strew the streets against their Prince, the Son of Shaddai, should\ncome; they also made garlands and other fine works to betoken how joyful\nthey were, and should be to receive their Emmanuel into Mansoul; yea,\nthey strewed the street quite from Eye-gate to the castle-gate, the place\nwhere the Prince should be.  They also prepared for his coming what music\nthe town of Mansoul would afford, that they might play before him to the\npalace, his habitation.\n\nSo, at the time appointed he makes his approach to Mansoul, and the gates\nwere set open for him; there also the ancients and elders of Mansoul met\nhim to salute him with a thousand welcomes.  Then he arose and entered\nMansoul, he and all his servants.  The elders of Mansoul did also go\ndancing before him till he came to the castle gates.  And this was the\nmanner of his going up thither:—He was clad in his golden armour, he rode\nin his royal chariot, the trumpets sounded about him, the colours were\ndisplayed, his ten thousands went up at his feet, and the elders of\nMansoul danced before him.  And now were the walls of the famous town of\nMansoul filled with the tramplings of the inhabitants thereof, who went\nup thither to view the approach of the blessed Prince and his royal army.\nAlso the casements, windows, balconies, and tops of the houses, were all\nnow filled with persons of all sorts, to behold how their town was to be\nfilled with good.\n\nNow, when he was come so far into the town as to the Recorder’s house, he\ncommanded that one should go to Captain Credence, to know whether the\ncastle of Mansoul was prepared to entertain his royal presence (for the\npreparation of that was left to that captain), and word was brought that\nit was.  Then was Captain Credence commanded also to come forth with his\npower to meet the Prince, the which was, as he had commanded, done; and\nhe conducted him into the castle.  This done, the Prince that night did\nlodge in the castle with his mighty captains and men of war, to the joy\nof the town of Mansoul.\n\nNow, the next care of the townsfolk was, how the captains and soldiers of\nthe Prince’s army should be quartered among them; and the care was not\nhow they should shut their hands of them, but how they should fill their\nhouses with them; for every man in Mansoul now had that esteem of\nEmmanuel and his men that nothing grieved them more than because they\nwere not enlarged enough, every one of them to receive the whole army of\nthe Prince; yea, they counted it their glory to be waiting upon them, and\nwould, in those days, run at their bidding like lackeys.\n\nAt last they came to this result:—\n\n1. That Captain Innocency should quarter at Mr. Reason’s.\n\n2. That Captain Patience should quarter at Mr. Mind’s.  This Mr. Mind was\nformerly the Lord Willbewill’s clerk in time of the late rebellion.\n\n3. It was ordered that Captain Charity should quarter at Mr. Affection’s\nhouse.\n\n4. That Captain Good-Hope should quarter at my Lord Mayor’s.  Now, for\nthe house of the Recorder, himself desired, because his house was next to\nthe castle, and because from him it was ordered by the Prince that, if\nneed be, the alarm should be given to Mansoul,—it was, I say, desired by\nhim that Captain Boanerges and Captain Conviction should take up their\nquarters with him, even they and all their men.\n\n5. As for Captain Judgment and Captain Execution, my Lord Willbewill took\nthem and their men to him, because he was to rule under the Prince for\nthe good of the town of Mansoul now, as he had before under the tyrant\nDiabolus for the hurt and damage thereof.\n\n6. And throughout the rest of the town were quartered Emmanuel’s forces;\nbut Captain Credence, with his men, abode still in the castle.  So the\nPrince, his captains, and his soldiers, were lodged in the town of\nMansoul.\n\nNow, the ancients and elders of the town of Mansoul thought that they\nnever should have enough of the Prince Emmanuel; his person, his actions,\nhis words, and behaviour, were so pleasing, so taking, so desirable to\nthem.  Wherefore they prayed him, that though the castle of Mansoul was\nhis place of residence, (and they desired that he might dwell there for\never,) yet that he would often visit the streets, houses, and people of\nMansoul.  ‘For,’ said they, ‘dread Sovereign, thy presence, thy looks,\nthy smiles, thy words, are the life, and strength, and sinews of the town\nof Mansoul.’\n\nBesides this, they craved that they might have, without difficulty or\ninterruption, continual access unto him, (so for that very purpose he\ncommanded that the gates should stand open,) that they might there see\nthe manner of his doings, the fortifications of the place, and the royal\nmansion-house of the Prince.\n\nWhen he spake, they all stopped their mouths and gave audience; and when\nhe walked, it was their delight to imitate him in his goings.\n\nNow, upon a time, Emmanuel made a feast for the town of Mansoul; and upon\nthe feasting-day the townsfolk were come to the castle to partake of his\nbanquet; and he feasted them with all manner of outlandish food;—food\nthat grew not in the fields of Mansoul; nor in all the whole Kingdom of\nUniverse; it was food that came from his Father’s court.  And so there\nwas dish after dish set before them, and they were commanded freely to\neat.  But still, when a fresh dish was set before them, they would\nwhisperingly say to each other, ‘What is it?’ for they wist not what to\ncall it.  They drank also of the water that was made wine, and were very\nmerry with him.  There was music also all the while at the table; and man\ndid eat angels’ food, and had honey given him out of the rock.  So\nMansoul did eat the food that was peculiar to the court; yea, they had\nnow thereof to the full.\n\nI must not forget to tell you, that as at this table there were\nmusicians, so they were not those of the country, nor yet of the town of\nMansoul; but they were the masters of the songs that were sung at the\ncourt of Shaddai.\n\nNow, after the feast was over, Emmanuel was for entertaining the town of\nMansoul with some curious riddles of secrets drawn up by his Father’s\nsecretary, by the skill and wisdom of Shaddai; the like to these there is\nnot in any kingdom.  These riddles were made upon the King Shaddai\nhimself, and upon Emmanuel his Son, and upon his wars and doings with\nMansoul.\n\nEmmanuel also expounded unto them some of those riddles himself; but, oh!\nhow they were lightened!  They saw what they never saw; they could not\nhave thought that such rarities could have been couched in so few and\nsuch ordinary words.  I told you before, whom these riddles did concern;\nand as they were opened, the people did evidently see it was so.  Yea,\nthey did gather that the things themselves were a kind of a portraiture,\nand that of Emmanuel himself; for when they read in the scheme where the\nriddles were writ, and looked in the face of the Prince, things looked so\nlike the one to the other, that Mansoul could not forbear but say, ‘This\nis the lamb! this is the sacrifice! this is the rock! this is the red\ncow! this is the door! and this is the way!’ with a great many other\nthings more.\n\nAnd thus he dismissed the town of Mansoul.  But can you imagine how the\npeople of the corporation were taken with this entertainment!  Oh! they\nwere transported with joy, they were drowned with wonderment, while they\nsaw and understood, and considered what their Emmanuel entertained them\nwithal, and what mysteries he opened to them.  And when they were at home\nin their houses, and in their most retired places, they could not but\nsing of him and of his actions.  Yea, so taken were the townsmen now with\ntheir Prince, that they would sing of him in their sleep.\n\nNow, it was in the heart of the Prince Emmanuel to new-model the town of\nMansoul, and to put it into such a condition as might be most pleasing to\nhim, and that might best stand with the profit and security of the now\nflourishing town of Mansoul.  He provided also against insurrections at\nhome, and invasions from abroad, such love had he for the famous town of\nMansoul.\n\nWherefore he first of all commanded that the great slings that were\nbrought from his Father’s court, when he came to the war of Mansoul,\nshould be mounted, some upon the battlements of the castle, some upon the\ntowers; for there were towers in the town of Mansoul, towers, new-built\nby Emmanuel since he came hither.  There was also an instrument, invented\nby Emmanuel, that was to throw stones from the castle of Mansoul, out at\nMouth-gate; an instrument that could not be resisted, nor that would miss\nof execution.  Wherefore, for the wonderful exploits that it did when\nused, it went without a name; and it was committed to the care of, and to\nbe managed by the brave captain, the Captain Credence, in case of war.\n\nThis done, Emmanuel called the Lord Willbewill to him, and gave him in\ncommandment to take care of the gates, the wall, and towers in Mansoul;\nalso the Prince gave him the militia into his hand, and a special charge\nto withstand all insurrections and tumults that might be made in Mansoul\nagainst the peace of our Lord the King, and the peace and tranquillity of\nthe town of Mansoul.  He also gave him in commission, that if he found\nany of the Diabolonians lurking in any corner of the famous town of\nMansoul, he should forthwith apprehend them, and stay them, or commit\nthem to safe custody, that they may be proceeded against according to\nlaw.\n\nThen he called unto him the Lord Understanding, who was the old Lord\nMayor, he that was put out of place when Diabolus took the town, and put\nhim into his former office again, and it became his place for his\nlifetime.  He bid him also that he should build him a palace near\nEye-gate; and that he should build it in fashion like a tower for\ndefence.  He bid him also that he should read in the Revelation of\nMysteries all the days of his life, that he might know how to perform his\noffice aright.\n\nHe also made Mr. Knowledge the Recorder, not of contempt to old Mr.\nConscience, who had been Recorder before, but for that it was in his\nprincely mind to confer upon Mr. Conscience another employ, of which he\ntold the old gentleman he should know more hereafter.\n\nThen he commanded that the image of Diabolus should be taken down from\nthe place where it was set up, and that they should destroy it utterly,\nbeating it into powder, and casting it into the wind without the town\nwall; and that the image of Shaddai, his Father, should be set up again,\nwith his own, upon the castle gates; and that it should be more fairly\ndrawn than ever, forasmuch as both his Father and himself were come to\nMansoul in more grace and mercy than heretofore.  He would also that his\nname should be fairly engraven upon the front of the town, and that it\nshould be done in the best of gold, for the honour of the town of\nMansoul.\n\nAfter this was done, Emmanuel gave out a commandment that those three\ngreat Diabolonians should be apprehended, namely, the two late Lord\nMayors, to wit, Mr. Incredulity, Mr. Lustings, and Mr. Forget-Good, the\nRecorder.  Besides these, there were some of them that Diabolus made\nburgesses and aldermen in Mansoul, that were committed to ward by the\nhand of the now valiant and now right noble, the brave Lord Willbewill.\n\nAnd these were their names: Alderman Atheism, Alderman Hard-Heart, and\nAlderman False-Peace.  The burgesses were, Mr. No-Truth, Mr. Pitiless,\nMr. Haughty, with the like.  These were committed to close custody, and\nthe gaoler’s name was Mr. True-Man.  This True-Man was one of those that\nEmmanuel brought with him from his Father’s court when at the first he\nmade a war upon Diabolus in the town or Mansoul.\n\nAfter this, the Prince gave a charge that the three strongholds that, at\nthe command of Diabolus, the Diabolonians built in Mansoul, should be\ndemolished and utterly pulled down; of which holds and their names, with\ntheir captains and governors, you read a little before.  But this was\nlong in doing, because of the largeness of the places, and because the\nstones, the timber, the iron, and all rubbish, was to be carried without\nthe town.\n\nWhen this was done, the Prince gave order that the Lord Mayor and\naldermen of Mansoul should call a court of judicature for the trial and\nexecution of the Diabolonians in the corporation now under the charge of\nMr. True-Man, the gaoler.\n\nNow, when the time was come, and the court set, commandment was sent to\nMr. True-Man, the gaoler, to bring the prisoners down to the bar.  Then\nwere the prisoners brought down, pinioned and chained together, as the\ncustom of the town of Mansoul was.  So, when they were presented before\nthe Lord Mayor, the Recorder, and the rest of the honourable bench,\nfirst, the jury was empannelled, and then the witnesses sworn.  The names\nof the jury were these: Mr. Belief, Mr. True-Heart, Mr. Upright, Mr.\nHate-Bad, Mr. Love-God, Mr. See-Truth, Mr. Heavenly-Mind, Mr. Moderate,\nMr. Thankful, Mr. Good-Work, Mr. Zeal-for-God, and Mr. Humble.\n\nThe names of the witnesses were—Mr. Know-All, Mr. Tell-True, Mr.\nHate-Lies, with my Lord Willbewill and his man, if need were.\n\nSo the prisoners were set to the bar.  Then said Mr. Do-Right, (for he\nwas the Town-Clerk,) ‘Set Atheism to the bar, gaoler.’  So he was set to\nthe bar.  Then said the Clerk, ‘Atheism, hold up thy hand.  Thou art here\nindicted by the name of Atheism, (an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,)\nfor that thou hast perniciously and doltishly taught and maintained that\nthere is no God, and so no heed to be taken to religion.  This thou hast\ndone against the being, honour, and glory of the King, and against the\npeace and safety of the town of Mansoul.  What sayest thou?  Art thou\nguilty of this indictment, or not?\n\n_Atheism_.  Not guilty.\n\n_Crier_.  Call Mr. Know-All, Mr. Tell-True, and Mr. Hate-Lies into the\ncourt.\n\nSo they were called, and they appeared.\n\nThen said the Clerk, ‘You, the witnesses for the King, look upon the\nprisoner at the bar; do you know him?’\n\nThen said Mr. Know-All, ‘Yes, my lord, we know him; his name is Atheism;\nhe has been a very pestilent fellow for many years in the miserable town\nof Mansoul.’\n\n_Clerk_.  You are sure you know him?\n\n_Know_.  Know him!  Yes my lord; I have heretofore too often been in his\ncompany to be at this time ignorant of him.  He is a Diabolonian, the son\nof a Diabolonian: I knew his grandfather and his father.\n\n_Clerk_.  Well said.  He standeth here indicted by the name of Atheism,\netc., and is charged that he hath maintained and taught that there is no\nGod, and so no heed need be taken to any religion.  What say you, the\nKing’s witnesses, to this?  Is he guilty or not?\n\n_Know_.  My lord, I and he were once in Villain’s Lane together, and he\nat that time did briskly talk of divers opinions; and then and there I\nheard him say, that, for his part, he did believe that there was no God.\n‘But,’ said he, ‘I can profess one, and be as religious too, if the\ncompany I am in, and the circumstances of other things,’ said he, ‘shall\nput me upon it.’\n\n_Clerk_.  You are sure you heard him say thus?\n\n_Know_.  Upon mine oath, I heard him say thus.\n\nThen said the Clerk, ‘Mr. Tell-True, what say you to the King’s judges\ntouching the prisoner at the bar?’\n\n_Tell_.  My lord, I formerly was a great companion of his, for the which\nI now repent me, and I have often heard him say, and that with very great\nstomachfulness, that he believed there was neither God, angel, nor\nspirit.\n\n_Clerk_.  Where did you hear him say so?\n\n_Tell_.  In Blackmouth Lane and in Blasphemer’s Row, and in many other\nplaces besides.\n\n_Clerk_.  Have you much knowledge of him?\n\n_Tell_.  I know him to be a Diabolonian, the son of a Diabolonian, and a\nhorrible man to deny a Deity.  His father’s name was Never-be-good, and\nhe had more children than this Atheism.  I have no more to say.\n\n_Clerk_.  Mr. Hate-Lies, look upon the prisoner at the bar; do you know\nhim?\n\n_Hate_.  My lord, this Atheism is one of the vilest wretches that ever I\ncame near, or had to do with in my life.  I have heard him say that there\nis no God; I have heard him say that there is no world to come, no sin,\nnor punishment hereafter, and, moreover, I have heard him say that it was\nas good to go to a whore-house as to go to hear a sermon.\n\n_Clerk_.  Where did you hear him say these things?\n\n_Hate_.  In Drunkard’s Row, just at Rascal-Lane’s End, at a house in\nwhich Mr. Impiety lived.\n\n_Clerk_.  Set him by, gaoler, and set Mr. Lustings to the bar.  Mr.\nLustings, thou art here indicted by the name of Lustings, (an intruder\nupon the town of Mansoul,) for that thou hast devilishly and traitorously\ntaught, by practice and filthy words, that it is lawful and profitable to\nman to give way to his carnal desires; and that thou, for thy part, hast\nnot, nor never wilt, deny thyself of any sinful delight as long as thy\nname is Lustings.  How sayest thou?  Art thou guilty of this indictment,\nor not?\n\nThen said Mr. Lustings, ‘My lord, I am a man of high birth, and have been\nused to pleasures and pastimes of greatness.  I have not been wont to be\nsnubbed for my doings, but have been left to follow my will as if it were\nlaw.  And it seems strange to me that I should this day be called into\nquestion for that, that not only I, but almost all men, do either\nsecretly or openly countenance, love, and approve of.’\n\n_Clerk_.  Sir, we concern not ourselves with your greatness; (though the\nhigher, the better you should have been;) but we are concerned, and so\nare you now, about an indictment preferred against you.  How say you?\nAre you guilty of it, or not?\n\n_Lust_.  Not guilty.\n\n_Clerk_.  Crier, call upon the witnesses to stand forth and give their\nevidence.\n\n_Crier_.  Gentlemen, you, the witnesses for the King, come in and give in\nyour evidence for our Lord the King against the prisoner at the bar.\n\n_Clerk_.  Come, Mr. Know-All, look upon the prisoner at the bar; do you\nknow him?\n\n_Know_.  Yes, my lord, I know him.\n\n_Clerk_.  What is his name?\n\n_Know_.  His name is Lustings; he was the son of one Beastly, and his\nmother bare him in Flesh Street: she was one Evil-Concupiscence’s\ndaughter.  I knew all the generation of them.\n\n_Clerk_.  Well said.  You have heard his indictment; what say you to it?\nIs he guilty of the things charged against him, or not?\n\n_Know_.  My lord, he has, as he saith, been a great man indeed, and\ngreater in wickedness than by pedigree more than a thousandfold.\n\n_Clerk_.  But what do you know of his particular actions, and especially\nwith reference to his indictment?\n\n_Know_.  I know him to be a swearer, a liar, a Sabbath-breaker; I know\nhim to be a fornicator and an unclean person; I know him to be guilty of\nabundance of evils.  He has been, to my knowledge, a very filthy man.\n\n_Clerk_.  But where did he use to commit his wickedness? in some private\ncorners, or more open and shamelessly?\n\n_Know_.  All the town over, my lord.\n\n_Clerk_.  Come, Mr. Tell-True, what have you to say for our Lord the King\nagainst the prisoner at the bar?\n\n_Tell_.  My lord, all that the first witness has said I know to be true,\nand a great deal more besides.\n\n_Clerk_.  Mr. Lustings, do you hear what these gentlemen say?\n\n_Lust_.  I was ever of opinion that the happiest life that a man could\nlive on earth was to keep himself back from nothing that he desired in\nthe world; nor have I been false at any time to this opinion of mine, but\nhave lived in the love of my notions all my days.  Nor was I ever so\nchurlish, having found such sweetness in them myself, as to keep the\ncommendations of them from others.\n\nThen said the Court, ‘There hath proceeded enough from his own mouth to\nlay him open to condemnation; wherefore, set him by, gaoler, and set Mr.\nIncredulity to the bar.’\n\nIncredulity set to the bar.\n\n_Clerk_.  Mr. Incredulity, thou art here indicted by the name of\nIncredulity, (an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for that thou hast\nfeloniously and wickedly, and that when thou wert an officer in the town\nof Mansoul, made head against the captains of the great King Shaddai when\nthey came and demanded possession of Mansoul; yea, thou didst bid\ndefiance to the name, forces, and cause of the King, and didst also, as\ndid Diabolus thy captain, stir up and encourage the town of Mansoul to\nmake head against and resist the said force of the King.  What sayest\nthou to this indictment?  Art thou guilty of it, or not?\n\nThen said Incredulity, ‘I know not Shaddai; I love my old prince; I\nthought it my duty to be true to my trust, and to do what I could to\npossess the minds of the men of Mansoul to do their utmost to resist\nstrangers and foreigners, and with might to fight against them.  Nor have\nI, nor shall I, change mine opinion for fear of trouble, though you at\npresent are possessed of place and power.’\n\nThen said the Court, ‘The man, as you see, is incorrigible; he is for\nmaintaining his villainies by stoutness of words, and his rebellion with\nimpudent confidence; and therefore set him by, gaoler, and set Mr.\nForget-Good to the bar.\n\nForget-Good set to the bar.\n\n_Clerk_.  Mr. Forget-Good, thou art here indicted by the name of\nForget-Good, (an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for that thou, when\nthe whole affairs of the town of Mansoul were in thy hand, didst utterly\nforget to serve them in what was good, and didst fall in with the tyrant\nDiabolus against Shaddai the King, against his captains, and all his\nhost, to the dishonour of Shaddai, the breach of his law, and the\nendangering of the destruction of the famous town of Mansoul.  What\nsayest thou to this indictment?  Art thou guilty or not guilty?\n\nThen said Forget-Good: ‘Gentlemen, and at this time my judges, as to the\nindictment by which I stand of several crimes accused before you, pray\nattribute my forgetfulness to mine age, and not to my wilfulness; to the\ncraziness of my brain, and not to the carelessness of my mind; and then I\nhope I may be by your charity excused from great punishment, though I be\nguilty.’\n\nThen said the Court, ‘Forget-Good, Forget-Good, thy forgetfulness of good\nwas not simply of frailty, but of purpose, and for that thou didst loathe\nto keep virtuous things in thy mind.  What was bad thou couldst retain,\nbut what was good thou couldst not abide to think of; thy age, therefore,\nand thy pretended craziness, thou makest use of to blind the court\nwithal, and as a cloak to cover thy knavery.  But let us hear what the\nwitnesses have to say for the King against the prisoner at the bar.  Is\nhe guilty of this indictment, or not?’\n\n_Hate_.  My lord, I have heard this Forget-Good say, that he could never\nabide to think of goodness, no, not for a quarter of an hour.\n\n_Clerk_.  Where did you hear him say so?\n\n_Hate_.  In All-base Lane, at a house next door to the sign of the\nConscience seared with a hot iron.\n\n_Clerk_.  Mr. Know-All, what can you say for our Lord the King against\nthe prisoner at the bar?\n\n_Know_.  My lord, I know this man well.  He is a Diabolonian, the son of\na Diabolonian: his father’s name was Love-Naught; and for him, I have\noften heard him say, that he counted the very thoughts of goodness the\nmost burdensome thing in the world.\n\n_Clerk_.  Where have you heard him say these words?\n\n_Know_.  In Flesh Lane, right opposite to the church.\n\nThen said the Clerk, ‘Come, Mr. Tell-True, give in your evidence\nconcerning the prisoner at the bar, about that for which he stands here,\nas you see, indicted by this honourable Court.’\n\n_Tell_.  My lord, I have heard him often say he had rather think of the\nvilest thing than of what is contained in the Holy Scriptures.\n\n_Clerk_.  Where did you hear him say such grievous words?\n\n_Tell_.  Where?—in a great many places, particularly in Nauseous Street,\nin the house of one Shameless, and in Filth Lane, at the sign of the\nReprobate, next door to the Descent into the Pit.\n\n_Court_.  Gentlemen, you have heard the indictment, his plea, and the\ntestimony of the witnesses.  Gaoler, set Mr. Hard-Heart to the bar.\n\nHe is set to the bar.\n\n_Clerk_.  Mr. Hard-Heart, thou art here indicted by the name of\nHard-Heart, (an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for that thou didst\nmost desperately and wickedly possess the town of Mansoul with\nimpenitency and obdurateness; and didst keep them from remorse and sorrow\nfor their evils, all the time of their apostacy from and rebellion\nagainst the blessed King Shaddai.  What sayest thou to this indictment?\nArt thou guilty, or not guilty?\n\n_Hard_.  My lord, I never knew what remorse or sorrow meant in all my\nlife.  I am impenetrable.  I care for no man; nor can I be pierced with\nmen’s griefs; their groans will not enter into my heart.  Whomsoever I\nmischief, whomsoever I wrong, to me it is music, when to others mourning.\n\n_Court_.  You see the man is a right Diabolonian, and has convicted\nhimself.  Set him by, gaoler, and set Mr. False-Peace to the bar.\n\nFalse-Peace set to the bar.\n\n‘Mr. False-Peace, thou art here indicted by the name of False-Peace, (an\nintruder upon the town of Mansoul,) for that thou didst most wickedly and\nsatanically bring, hold, and keep the town of Mansoul, both in her\napostacy and in her hellish rebellion, in a false, groundless, and\ndangerous peace, and damnable security, to the dishonour of the King, the\ntransgression of his law, and the great damage of the town of Mansoul.\nWhat sayest thou?  Art thou guilty of this indictment, or not?\n\nThen said Mr. False-Peace: ‘Gentlemen, and you now appointed to be my\njudges, I acknowledge that my name is Mr. Peace; but that my name is\nFalse-Peace I utterly deny.  If your honours shall please to send for any\nthat do intimately know me, or for the midwife that laid my mother of me,\nor for the gossips that were at my christening, they will, any or all of\nthem, prove that my name is not False-Peace, but Peace.  Wherefore I\ncannot plead to this indictment, forasmuch as my name is not inserted\ntherein; and as is my true name, so are also my conditions.  I was always\na man that loved to live at quiet, and what I loved myself, that I\nthought others might love also.  Wherefore, when I saw any of my\nneighbours to labour under a disquieted mind, I endeavoured to help them\nwhat I could; and instances of this good temper of mine many I could\ngive; as,\n\n‘1. When, at the beginning, our town of Mansoul did decline the ways of\nShaddai, they, some of them, afterwards began to have disquieting\nreflections upon themselves for what they had done; but I, as one\ntroubled to see them disquieted, presently sought out means to get them\nquiet again.\n\n‘2. When the ways of the old world, and of Sodom, were in fashion, if\nanything happened to molest those that were for the customs of the\npresent times, I laboured to make them quiet again, and to cause them to\nact without molestation.\n\n‘3. To come nearer home: when the wars fell out between Shaddai and\nDiabolus, if at any time I saw any of the town of Mansoul afraid of\ndestruction, I often used, by some way, device, invention, or other, to\nlabour to bring them to peace again.  Wherefore, since I have been always\na man of so virtuous a temper as some say a peace-maker is, and if a\npeace-maker be so deserving a man as some have been bold to attest he is,\nthen let me, gentlemen, be accounted by you, who have a great name for\njustice and equity in Mansoul, for a man that deserveth not this inhuman\nway of treatment, but liberty, and also a license to seek damage of those\nthat have been my accusers.’\n\nThen said the clerk, ‘Crier, make a proclamation.’\n\n_Crier_.  Oyes!  Forasmuch as the prisoner at the bar hath denied his\nname to be that which is mentioned in the indictment, the Court requireth\nthat if there be any in this place that can give information to the Court\nof the original and right name of the prisoner, they would come forth and\ngive in their evidence; for the prisoner stands upon his own innocency.\n\nThen came two into the court, and desired that they might have leave to\nspeak what they knew concerning the prisoner at the bar: the name of the\none was Search-Truth, and the name of the other Vouch-Truth.  So the\nCourt demanded of these men if they knew the prisoner, and what they\ncould say concerning him, ‘for he stands,’ said they, ‘upon his own\nvindication.’\n\nThen said Mr. Search-Truth, ‘My Lord, I—’\n\n_Court_.  Hold! give him his oath.\n\nThen they sware him.  So he proceeded.\n\n_Search_.  My lord, I know and have known this man from a child, and can\nattest that his name is False-Peace.  I know his father; his name was Mr.\nFlatter: and his mother, before she was married, was called by the name\nof Mrs. Sooth-Up: and these two, when they came together, lived not long\nwithout this son; and when he was born, they called his name False-Peace.\nI was his play-fellow, only I was somewhat older than he; and when his\nmother did use to call him home from his play, she used to say,\n‘False-Peace, False-Peace, come home quick, or I’ll fetch you.’  Yea, I\nknew him when he sucked; and though I was then but little, yet I can\nremember that when his mother did use to sit at the door with him, or did\nplay with him in her arms, she would call him, twenty times together, ‘My\nlittle False-Peace! my pretty False-Peace!’ and, ‘Oh! my sweet rogue,\nFalse-Peace!’ and again, ‘Oh! my little bird, False-Peace!’ and ‘How do I\nlove my child!’  The gossips also know it is thus, though he has had the\nface to deny it in open court.\n\nThen Mr. Vouch-Truth was called upon to speak what he knew of him.  So\nthey sware him.\n\nThen said Mr. Vouch-Truth, ‘My lord, all that the former witness hath\nsaid is true.  His name is False-Peace, the son of Mr. Flatter, and of\nMrs. Sooth-Up, his mother: and I have in former times seen him angry with\nthose that have called him anything else but False-Peace, for he would\nsay that all such did mock and nickname him; but this was in the time\nwhen Mr. False-Peace was a great man, and when the Diabolonians were the\nbrave men in Mansoul.\n\n_Court_.  Gentlemen, you have heard what these two men have sworn against\nthe prisoner at the bar.  And now, Mr. False-Peace, to you: you have\ndenied your name to be False-Peace, yet you see that these honest men\nhave sworn that that is your name.  As to your plea, in that you are\nquite besides the matter of your indictment, you are not by it charged\nfor evil-doing because you are a man of peace, or a peace-maker among\nyour neighbours; but for that you did wickedly and satanically bring,\nkeep, and hold the town of Mansoul, both under its apostasy from, and in\nits rebellion against its King, in a false, lying, and damnable peace,\ncontrary to the law of Shaddai, and to the hazard of the destruction of\nthe then miserable town of Mansoul.  All that you have pleaded for\nyourself is, that you have denied your name, etc.; but here, you see, we\nhave witnesses to prove that you are the man.  For the peace that you so\nmuch boast of making among your neighbours, know that peace that is not a\ncompanion of truth and holiness, but that which is without this\nfoundation, is grounded upon a lie, and is both deceitful and damnable,\nas also the great Shaddai hath said.  Thy plea, therefore, has not\ndelivered thee from what by the indictment thou art charged with, but\nrather it doth fasten all upon thee.  But thou shalt have very fair play.\nLet us call the witnesses that are to testify as to matter of fact, and\nsee what they have to say for our Lord the King against the prisoner at\nthe bar.\n\n_Clerk_.  Mr. Know-All, what say you for our Lord the King against the\nprisoner at the bar?\n\n_Know_.  My lord, this man hath of a long time made it, to my knowledge,\nhis business to keep the town of Mansoul in a sinful quietness in the\nmidst of all her lewdness, filthiness, and turmoils, and hath said, and\nthat in my hearing, Come, come, let us fly from all trouble, on what\nground soever it comes, and let us be for a quiet and peaceable life,\nthough it wanteth a good foundation.\n\n_Clerk_.  Come, Mr. Hate-Lies, what have you to say?\n\n_Hate_.  My lord, I have heard him say, that peace, though in a way of\nunrighteousness, is better than trouble with truth.\n\n_Clerk_.  Where did you hear him say this?\n\n_Hate_.  I heard him say it in Folly-yard, at the house of one Mr.\nSimple, next door to the sign of the Self-deceiver.  Yea, he hath said\nthis to my knowledge twenty times in that place.\n\n_Clerk_.  We may spare further witness; this evidence is plain and full.\nSet him by, gaoler, and set Mr. No-Truth to the bar.  Mr. No-Truth, thou\nart here indicted by the name of No-Truth, (an intruder upon the town of\nMansoul,) for that thou hast always, to the dishonour of Shaddai, and the\nendangering of the utter ruin of the famous town of Mansoul, set thyself\nto deface, and utterly to spoil, all the remainders of the law and image\nof Shaddai that have been found in Mansoul after her deep apostasy from\nher king to Diabolus, the envious tyrant.  What sayest thou, art thou\nguilty of this indictment, or not?\n\n_No_.  Not guilty, my lord.\n\nThen the witnesses were called, and Mr. Know-All did first give in his\nevidence against him.\n\n_Know_.  My lord, this man was at the pulling down of the image of\nShaddai; yea, this is he that did it with his own hands.  I myself stood\nby and saw him do it, and he did it at the commandment of Diabolus.  Yea,\nthis Mr. No-Truth did more than this, he did also set up the horned image\nof the beast Diabolus in the same place.  This also is he that, at the\nbidding of Diabolus, did rend and tear, and cause to be consumed, all\nthat he could of the remainders of the law of the King, even whatever he\ncould lay his hands on in Mansoul.\n\n_Clerk_.  Who saw him do this besides yourself?\n\n_Hate_.  I did, my lord, and so did many more besides; for this was not\ndone by stealth, or in a corner, but in the open view of all; yea, he\nchose himself to do it publicly, for he delighted in the doing of it.\n\n_Clerk_.  Mr. No-Truth, how could you have the face to plead not guilty,\nwhen you were so manifestly the doer of all this wickedness?\n\n_No_.  Sir, I thought I must say something, and as my name is, so I\nspeak.  I have been advantaged thereby before now, and did not know but\nby speaking no truth, I might have reaped the same benefit now.\n\n_Clerk_.  Set him by, gaoler, and set Mr. Pitiless to the bar.  Mr.\nPitiless, thou art here indicted by the name of Pitiless, (an intruder\nupon the town of Mansoul,) for that thou didst most traitorously and\nwickedly shut up all bowels of compassion, and wouldest not suffer poor\nMansoul to condole her own misery when she had apostatised from her\nrightful King, but didst evade, and at all times turn her mind awry from\nthose thoughts that had in them a tendency to lead her to repentance.\nWhat sayest thou to this indictment?  Guilty or not guilty?\n\n‘Not guilty of pitilessness: all I did was to cheer up, according to my\nname, for my name is not Pitiless, but Cheer-up; and I could not abide to\nsee Mansoul inclined to melancholy.’\n\n_Clerk_.  How! do you deny your name, and say it is not Pitiless, but\nCheer-up? Call for the witnesses.  What say you, the witnesses, to this\nplea?\n\n_Know_.  My lord, his name is Pitiless; so he hath written himself in all\npapers of concern wherein he has had to do.  But these Diabolonians love\nto counterfeit their names: Mr. Covetousness covers himself with the name\nof Good-Husbandry, or the like; Mr. Pride can, when need is, call himself\nMr. Neat, Mr. Handsome, or the like; and so of all the rest of them.\n\n_Clerk_.  Mr. Tell-True, what say you?\n\n_Tell_.  His name is Pitiless, my lord.  I have known him from a child,\nand he hath done all that wickedness whereof he stands charged in the\nindictment; but there is a company of them that are not acquainted with\nthe danger of damning, therefore they call all those melancholy that have\nserious thoughts how that state should be shunned by them.\n\n_Clerk_.  Set Mr. Haughty to the bar, gaoler.  Mr. Haughty, thou art here\nindicted by the name of Haughty, (an intruder upon the town of Mansoul,)\nfor that thou didst most traitorously and devilishly teach the town of\nMansoul to carry it loftily and stoutly against the summons that was\ngiven them by the captains of the King Shaddai.  Thou didst also teach\nthe town of Mansoul to speak contemptuously and vilifyingly of their\ngreat King Shaddai; and didst moreover encourage, both by words and\nexamples, Mansoul, to take up arms both against the King and his son\nEmmanuel.  How sayest thou, art thou guilty of this indictment, or not?\n\n_Haughty_.  Gentlemen, I have always been a man of courage and valour,\nand have not used, when under the greatest clouds, to sneak or hang down\nthe head like a bulrush; nor did it at all at any time please me to see\nmen veil their bonnets to those that have opposed them; yea, though their\nadversaries seemed to have ten times the advantage of them.  I did not\nuse to consider who was my foe, nor what the cause was in which I was\nengaged.  It was enough to me if I carried it bravely, fought like a man,\nand came off a victor.\n\n_Court_.  Mr. Haughty, you are not here indicted for that you have been a\nvaliant man, nor for your courage and stoutness in times of distress, but\nfor that you have made use of this your pretended valour to draw the town\nof Mansoul into acts of rebellion both against the great King, and\nEmmanuel his Son.  This is the crime and the thing wherewith thou art\ncharged in and by the indictment.\n\nBut he made no answer to that.\n\nNow when the Court had thus far proceeded against the prisoners at the\nbar, then they put them over to the verdict of their jury, to whom they\ndid apply themselves after this manner:\n\n‘Gentlemen of the jury, you have been here, and have seen these men; you\nhave heard their indictments, their pleas, and what the witnesses have\ntestified against them: now what remains, is, that you do forthwith\nwithdraw yourselves to some place, where without confusion you may\nconsider of what verdict, in a way of truth and righteousness, you ought\nto bring in for the King against them, and so bring it in accordingly.’\n\nThen the jury, to wit, Mr. Belief, Mr. True-Heart, Mr. Upright, Mr.\nHate-bad, Mr. Love-God, Mr. See-Truth, Mr. Heavenly-Mind, Mr. Moderate,\nMr. Thankful, Mr. Humble, Mr. Good-Work, and Mr. Zeal-for-God, withdrew\nthemselves in order to their work.  Now when they were shut up by\nthemselves, they fell to discourse among themselves in order to the\ndrawing up of their verdict.\n\nAnd thus Mr. Belief (for he was the foreman) began: ‘Gentlemen,’ quoth\nhe, ‘for the men, the prisoners at the bar, for my part I believe that\nthey all deserve death.’  ‘Very right,’ said Mr. True-Heart; ‘I am wholly\nof your opinion.’  ‘Oh what a mercy is it,’ said Mr. Hate-Bad, ‘that such\nvillains as these are apprehended!’  ‘Ay! ay!’ said Mr. Love-God, ‘this\nis one of the joyfullest days that ever I saw in my life.’  Then said Mr.\nSee-Truth, ‘I know that if we judge them to death, our verdict shall\nstand before Shaddai himself’  ‘Nor do I at all question it,’ said Mr.\nHeavenly-Mind; he said, moreover, ‘When all such beasts as these are cast\nout of Mansoul, what a goodly town will it be then!’  ‘Then,’ said Mr.\nModerate, ‘it is not my manner to pass my judgment with rashness; but for\nthese their crimes are so notorious, and the witness so palpable, that\nthat man must be wilfully blind who saith the prisoners ought not to\ndie.’  ‘Blessed be God,’ said Mr. Thankful, ‘that the traitors are in\nsafe custody.’  ‘And I join with you in this upon my bare knees,’ said\nMr. Humble.  ‘I am glad also,’ said Mr. Good-Work.  Then said the warm\nman, and true-hearted Mr. Zeal-for-God, ‘Cut them off; they have been the\nplague, and have sought the destruction of Mansoul.’\n\nThus, therefore, being all agreed in their verdict, they come instantly\ninto the Court.\n\n_Clerk_.  Gentlemen of the jury, answer all to your names: Mr. Belief,\none; Mr. True-Heart, two; Mr. Upright, three; Mr. Hate-Bad, four; Mr.\nLove-God, five; Mr. See-Truth, six; Mr. Heavenly-mind, seven; Mr.\nModerate, eight; Mr. Thankful, nine; Mr. Humble, ten; Mr. Good-Work,\neleven; and Mr. Zeal-for-God, twelve.  Good men and true, stand together\nin your verdict: are you all agreed?\n\n_Jury_.  Yes, my lord.\n\n_Clerk_.  Who shall speak for you?\n\n_Jury_.  Our foreman.\n\n_Clerk_.  You, the gentlemen of the jury, being empannelled for our Lord\nthe King, to serve here in a matter of life and death, have heard the\ntrials of each of these men, the prisoners at the bar: what say you? are\nthey guilty of that, and those crimes for which they stand here indicted,\nor are they not guilty?\n\n_Foreman_.  Guilty, my lord.\n\n_Clerk_.  Look to your prisoners, gaoler.\n\nThis was done in the morning, and in the afternoon they received the\nsentence of death according to the law.\n\nThe gaoler, therefore, having received such a charge, put them all in the\ninward prison, to preserve them there till the day of execution, which\nwas to be the next day in the morning.\n\nBut now to see how it happened, one of the prisoners, Incredulity by\nname, in the interim betwixt the sentence and the time of execution,\nbrake prison and made his escape, and gets him away quite out of the town\nof Mansoul, and lay lurking in such places and holes as he might, until\nhe should again have opportunity to do the town of Mansoul a mischief for\ntheir thus handling of him as they did.\n\nNow when Mr. Trueman, the gaoler, perceived that he had lost his\nprisoner, he was in a heavy taking, because that prisoner was, to speak\non, the very worst of all the gang: wherefore first he goes and acquaints\nmy Lord Mayor, Mr. Recorder, and my Lord Willbewill, with the matter, and\nto get of them an order to make search for him throughout the town of\nMansoul.  So an order he got, and search was made, but no such man could\nnow be found in all the town of Mansoul.\n\nAll that could be gathered was, that he had lurked a while about the\noutside of the town, and that here and there one or other had a glimpse\nof him as he did make his escape out of Mansoul; one or two also did\naffirm that they saw him without the town, going apace quite over the\nplain.  Now when he was quite gone, it was affirmed by one Mr. Did-see,\nthat he ranged all over dry places, till he met with Diabolus, his\nfriend, and where should they meet one another but just upon Hell-gate\nhill.\n\nBut oh! what a lamentable story did the old gentleman tell to Diabolus\nconcerning what sad alteration Emmanuel had made in Mansoul!\n\nAs, first, how Mansoul had, after some delays, received a general pardon\nat the hands of Emmanuel, and that they had invited him into the town,\nand that they had given him the castle for his possession.  He said,\nmoreover, that they had called his soldiers into the town, coveted who\nshould quarter the most of them; they also entertained him with the\ntimbrel, song, and dance.  ‘But that,’ said Incredulity, ‘which is the\nsorest vexation to me is, that he hath pulled down, O father, thy image,\nand set up his own; pulled down thy officers and set up his own.  Yea,\nand Willbewill, that rebel, who, one would have thought, should never\nhave turned from us, he is now in as great favour with Emmanuel as ever\nhe was with thee.  But, besides all this, this Willbewill has received a\nspecial commission from his master to search for, to apprehend, and to\nput to death all, and all manner of Diabolonians that he shall find in\nMansoul: yea, and this Willbewill has taken and committed to prison\nalready eight of my Lord’s most trusty friends in Mansoul.  Nay, further,\nmy Lord, with grief I speak it, they have been all arraigned, condemned,\nand, I doubt, before this executed in Mansoul.  I told my Lord of eight,\nand myself was the ninth, who should assuredly have drunk of the same\ncup, but that through craft, I, as thou seest, have made mine escape from\nthem.’\n\nWhen Diabolus had heard this lamentable story, he yelled and snuffed up\nthe wind like a dragon, and made the sky to look dark with his roaring;\nhe also sware that he would try to be revenged on Mansoul for this.  So\nthey, both he and his old friend Incredulity, concluded to enter into\ngreat consultation, how they might get the town of Mansoul again.\n\nNow, before this time, the day was come in which the prisoners in Mansoul\nwere to be executed.  So they were brought to the cross, and that by\nMansoul, in most solemn manner; for the Prince said that this should be\ndone by the hand of the town of Mansoul, ‘that I may see,’ said he, ‘the\nforwardness of my now redeemed Mansoul to keep my word, and to do my\ncommandments; and that I may bless Mansoul in doing this deed.  Proof of\nsincerity pleases me well; let Mansoul therefore first lay their hands\nupon these Diabolonians to destroy them.’\n\nSo the town of Mansoul slew them, according to the word of their Prince;\nbut when the prisoners were brought to the cross to die, you can hardly\nbelieve what troublesome work Mansoul had of it to put the Diabolonians\nto death; for the men, knowing that they must die, and every of them\nhaving implacable enmity in their hearts to Mansoul, what did they but\ntook courage at the cross, and there resisted the men of the town of\nMansoul?  Wherefore the men of Mansoul were forced to cry out for help to\nthe captains and men of war.  Now the great Shaddai had a secretary in\nthe town, and he was a great lover of the men of Mansoul, and he was at\nthe place of execution also; so he, hearing the men of Mansoul cry out\nagainst the strugglings and unruliness of the prisoners, rose up from his\nplace, and came and put his hands upon the hands of the men of Mansoul.\nSo they crucified the Diabolonians that had been a plague, a grief, and\nan offence to the town of Mansoul.\n\nNow, when this good work was done, the Prince came down to see, to visit,\nand to speak comfortably to the men of Mansoul, and to strengthen their\nhands in such work.  And he said to them that, by this act of theirs he\nhad proved them, and found them to be lovers of his person, observers of\nhis laws, and such as had also respect to his honour.  He said, moreover,\n(to show them that they by this should not be losers, nor their town\nweakened by the loss of them,) that he would make them another captain,\nand that of one of themselves.  And that this captain should be the ruler\nof a thousand, for the good and benefit of the now flourishing town of\nMansoul.\n\nSo he called one to him whose name was Waiting, and bid him, ‘Go quickly\nup to the castle gate, and inquire there for one Mr. Experience, that\nwaiteth upon that noble captain, the Captain Credence, and bid him come\nhither to me.’  So the messenger that waited upon the good Prince\nEmmanuel went and said as he was commanded.  Now the young gentleman was\nwaiting to see the captain train and muster his men in the castle yard.\nThen said Mr. Waiting to him, ‘Sir, the Prince would that you should come\ndown to his highness forthwith.’  So he brought him down to Emmanuel, and\nhe came and made obeisance before him.  Now the men of the town knew Mr.\nExperience well, for he was born and bred in Mansoul; they also knew him\nto be a man of conduct, of valour, and a person prudent in matters; he\nwas also a comely person, well-spoken, and very successful in his\nundertakings.\n\nWherefore the hearts of the townsmen were transported with joy when they\nsaw that the Prince himself was so taken with Mr. Experience, that he\nwould needs make him a captain over a band of men.\n\nSo with one consent they bowed the knee before Emmanuel, and with a shout\nsaid, ‘Let Emmanuel live for ever!’  Then said the Prince to the young\ngentleman, whose name was Mr. Experience, ‘I have thought good to confer\nupon thee a place of trust and honour in this my town of Mansoul.’  Then\nthe young man bowed his head and worshipped.  ‘It is,’ said Emmanuel,\n‘that thou shouldest be a captain, a captain over a thousand men in my\nbeloved town of Mansoul.’  Then said the captain, ‘Let the King live!’\nSo the Prince gave out orders forthwith to the King’s secretary, that he\nshould draw up for Mr. Experience a commission to make him a captain over\na thousand men.  ‘And let it be brought to me,’ said he, ‘that I may set\nto my seal.’  So it was done as it was commanded.  The commission was\ndrawn up, brought to Emmanuel, and he set his seal thereto.  Then, by the\nhand of Mr. Waiting, he sent it away to the captain.\n\nNow as soon as the captain had received his commission, he sounded his\ntrumpet for volunteers, and young men came to him apace; yea, the\ngreatest and chief men in the town sent their sons, to be listed under\nhis command.  Thus Captain Experience came under command to Emmanuel, for\nthe good of the town of Mansoul.  He had for his lieutenant one Mr.\nSkilful, and for his cornet one Mr. Memory.  His under officers I need\nnot name.  His colours were the white colours for the town of Mansoul;\nand his scutcheon was the dead lion and dead bear.  So the Prince\nreturned to his royal palace again.\n\nNow when he was returned thither, the elders of the town of Mansoul, to\nwit, the Lord Mayor, the Recorder, and the Lord Willbewill, went to\ncongratulate him, and in special way to thank him for his love, care, and\nthe tender compassion which he showed to his ever-obliged town of\nMansoul.  So after a while, and some sweet communion between them, the\ntownsmen having solemnly ended their ceremony, returned to their place\nagain.\n\nEmmanuel also at this time appointed them a day wherein he would renew\ntheir charter, yea, wherein he would renew and enlarge it, mending\nseveral faults therein, that Mansoul’s yoke might be yet more easy.  And\nthis he did without any desire of theirs, even of his own frankness and\nnoble mind.  So when he had sent for and seen their old one, he laid it\nby, and said, ‘Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish\naway.’  He said, moreover, ‘The town of Mansoul shall have another, a\nbetter, a new one, more steady and firm by far.’  An epitome hereof take\nas follows:—\n\n‘Emmanuel, Prince of Peace, and a great lover of the town of Mansoul, I\ndo in the name of my Father, and of mine own clemency, give, grant, and\nbequeath to my beloved town of Mansoul.\n\n‘First.  Free, full, and everlasting forgiveness of all wrongs, injuries,\nand offences done by them against my Father, me, their neighbour, or\nthemselves.\n\n‘Second.  I do give them the holy law and my testament, with all that\ntherein is contained, for their everlasting comfort and consolation.\n\n‘Third.  I do also give them a portion of the self-same grace and\ngoodness that dwells in my Father’s heart and mine.\n\n‘Fourth.  I do give, grant, and bestow upon them freely, the world and\nwhat is therein, for their good; and they shall have that power over\nthem, as shall stand with the honour of my Father, my glory, and their\ncomfort: yea, I grant them the benefits of life and death, and of things\npresent, and things to come.  This privilege no other city, town, or\ncorporation, shall have, but my Mansoul only.\n\n‘Fifth.  I do give and grant them leave, and free access to me in my\npalace at all seasons—to my palace above or below—there to make known\ntheir wants to me, and I give them, moreover, a promise that I will hear\nand redress all their grievances.\n\n‘Sixth.  I do give, grant to, and invest the town of Mansoul with full\npower and authority to seek out, take, enslave, and destroy all, and all\nmanner of Diabolonians that at any time, from whencesoever, shall be\nfound straggling in or about the town of Mansoul.\n\n‘Seventh.  I do further grant to my beloved town of Mansoul, that they\nshall have authority not to suffer any foreigner, or stranger, or their\nseed, to be free in, and of the blessed town of Mansoul, nor to share in\nthe excellent privileges thereof.  But that all the grants, privileges,\nand immunities that I bestow upon the famous town of Mansoul, shall be\nfor those the old natives, and true inhabitants thereof; to them, I say,\nand to their right seed after them.\n\n‘But all Diabolonians, of what sort, birth, country, or kingdom soever,\nshall be debarred a share therein.’\n\nSo when the town of Mansoul had received at the hand of Emmanuel their\ngracious charter, (which in itself is infinitely more large than by this\nlean epitome is set before you,) they carried it to audience, that is, to\nthe market place, and there Mr. Recorder read it in the presence of all\nthe people.  This being done, it was had back to the castle gates, and\nthere fairly engraven upon the doors thereof, and laid in letters of\ngold, to the end that the town of Mansoul, with all the people thereof,\nmight have it always in their view, or might go where they might see what\na blessed freedom their Prince had bestowed upon them, that their joy\nmight be increased in themselves, and their love renewed to their great\nand good Emmanuel.\n\nBut what joy, what comfort, what consolation, think you, did now possess\nthe hearts of the men of Mansoul!  The bells rung, the minstrels played,\nthe people danced, the captains shouted, the colours waved in the wind,\nand the silver trumpets sounded; and the Diabolonians now were glad to\nhide their heads, for they looked like them that had been long dead.\n\nWhen this was over, the Prince sent again for the elders of the town of\nMansoul, and communed with them about a ministry that he intended to\nestablish among them; such a ministry that might open unto them, and that\nmight instruct them in the things that did concern their present and\nfuture state.\n\n‘For,’ said he, ‘you, of yourselves, unless you have teachers and guides,\nwill not be able to know, and, if not to know, to be sure not to do the\nwill of my Father.’\n\nAt this news, when the elders of Mansoul brought it to the people, the\nwhole town came running together, (for it pleased them well, as whatever\nthe Prince now did pleased the people,) and all with one consent implored\nhis Majesty that he would forthwith establish such a ministry among them\nas might teach them both law and judgment, statute and commandment; that\nthey might be documented in all good and wholesome things.  So he told\nthem that he would grant them their requests, and would establish two\namong them; one that was of his Father’s court, and one that was a native\nof Mansoul.\n\n‘He that is from the court,’ said he, ‘is a person of no less quality and\ndignity than my Father and I; and he is the Lord Chief Secretary of my\nFather’s house: for he is, and always has been, the chief dictator of all\nmy Father’s laws, a person altogether well skilled in all mysteries, and\nknowledge of mysteries, as is my Father, or as myself is.  Indeed he is\none with us in nature, and also as to loving of, and being faithful to,\nand in the eternal concerns of the town of Mansoul.\n\n‘And this is he,’ said the Prince, ‘that must be your chief teacher; for\nit is he, and he only, that can teach you clearly in all high and\nsupernatural things.  He, and he only, it is that knows the ways and\nmethods of my Father at court, nor can any like him show how the heart of\nmy Father is at all times, in all things, upon all occasions, towards\nMansoul; for as no man knows the things of a man but that spirit of a man\nwhich is in him, so the things of my Father knows no man but this his\nhigh and mighty Secretary.  Nor can any, as he, tell Mansoul how and what\nthey shall do to keep themselves in the love of my Father.  He also it is\nthat can bring lost things to your remembrance, and that can tell you\nthings to come.  This teacher, therefore, must of necessity have the\npre-eminence, both in your affections and judgment, before your other\nteacher; his personal dignity, the excellency of his teaching, also the\ngreat dexterity that he hath to help you to make and draw up petitions to\nmy Father for your help, and to his pleasing, must lay obligations upon\nyou to love him, fear him, and to take heed that you grieve him not.\n\n‘This person can put life and vigour into all he says; yea, and can also\nput it into your heart.  This person can make seers of you, and can make\nyou tell what shall be hereafter.  By this person you must frame all your\npetitions to my Father and me; and without his advice and counsel first\nobtained, let nothing enter into the town or castle of Mansoul, for that\nmay disgust and grieve this noble person.\n\n‘Take heed, I say, that you do not grieve this minister; for if you do,\nhe may fight against you; and should he once be moved by you to set\nhimself against you in battle array, that will distress you more than if\ntwelve legions should from my Father’s court be sent to make war upon\nyou.\n\n‘But, as I said, if you shall hearken unto him, and shall love him; if\nyou shall devote yourselves to his teaching, and shall seek to have\nconverse, and to maintain communion with him, you shall find him ten\ntimes better than is the whole world to any; yea, he will shed abroad the\nlove of my Father in your hearts, and Mansoul will be the wisest, and\nmost blessed of all people.’\n\nThen did the Prince call unto him the old gentleman, who before had been\nthe Recorder of Mansoul, Mr. Conscience by name, and told him, That,\nforasmuch as he was well skilled in the law and government of the town of\nMansoul, and was also well-spoken, and could pertinently deliver to them\nhis Master’s will in all terrene and domestic matters, therefore he would\nalso make him a minister for, in, and to the goodly town of Mansoul, in\nall the laws, statutes, and judgments of the famous town of Mansoul.\n‘And thou must,’ said the Prince, ‘confine thyself to the teaching of\nmoral virtues, to civil and natural duties; but thou must not attempt to\npresume to be a revealer of those high and supernatural mysteries that\nare kept close in the bosom of Shaddai, my Father: for those things knows\nno man, nor can any reveal them but my Father’s Secretary only.\n\n‘Thou art a native of the town of Mansoul, but the Lord Secretary is a\nnative with my Father; wherefore, as thou hast knowledge of the laws and\ncustoms of the corporation, so he of the things and will of my Father.\n\n‘Wherefore, O Mr. Conscience, although I have made thee a minister and a\npreacher to the town of Mansoul, yet as to the things which the Lord\nSecretary knoweth, and shall teach to this people, there thou must be his\nscholar and a learner, even as the rest of Mansoul are.\n\n‘Thou must therefore, in all high and supernatural things, go to him for\ninformation and knowledge; for though there be a spirit in man, this\nperson’s inspiration must give him understanding.  Wherefore, O thou Mr.\nRecorder, keep low and be humble, and remember that the Diabolonians that\nkept not their first charge, but left their own standing, are now made\nprisoners in the pit.  Be therefore content with thy station.\n\n‘I have made thee my Father’s vicegerent on earth, in such things of\nwhich I have made mention before: and thou, take thou power to teach them\nto Mansoul, yea, and to impose them with whips and chastisements, if they\nshall not willingly hearken to do thy commandments.\n\n‘And, Mr. Recorder, because thou art old, and through many abuses made\nfeeble; therefore I give thee leave and license to go when thou wilt to\nmy fountain, my conduit, and there to drink freely of the blood of my\ngrape, for my conduit doth always run wine.  Thus doing, thou shalt drive\nfrom thine heart and stomach all foul, gross, and hurtful humours.  It\nwill also lighten thine eyes, and will strengthen thy memory for the\nreception and keeping of all that the King’s most noble Secretary\nteacheth.’\n\nWhen the Prince had thus put Mr. Recorder (that once so was) into the\nplace and office of a minister to Mansoul, and the man had thankfully\naccepted thereof, then did Emmanuel address himself in a particular\nspeech to the townsmen themselves.\n\n‘Behold,’ said the Prince to Mansoul, ‘my love and care towards you; I\nhave added to all that is past, this mercy, to appoint you preachers; the\nmost noble Secretary to teach you in all high and sublime mysteries; and\nthis gentleman,’ pointing to Mr. Conscience, ‘is to teach you in all\nthings human and domestic, for therein lieth his work.  He is not, by\nwhat I have said, debarred of telling to Mansoul anything that he hath\nheard and received at the mouth of the lord high Secretary; only he shall\nnot attempt to presume to pretend to be a revealer of those high\nmysteries himself; for the breaking of them up, and the discovery of them\nto Mansoul lieth only in the power, authority, and skill of the lord high\nSecretary himself.  Talk of them he may, and so may the rest of the town\nof Mansoul; yea, and may, as occasion gives them opportunity, press them\nupon each other for the benefit of the whole.  These things, therefore, I\nwould have you observe and do, for it is for your life, and the\nlengthening of your days.\n\n‘And one thing more to my beloved Mr. Recorder, and to all the town of\nMansoul: You must not dwell in, nor stay upon, anything of that which he\nhath in commission to teach you, as to your trust and expectation of the\nnext world; (of the next world, I say, for I purpose to give another to\nMansoul, when this with them is worn out;) but for that you must wholly\nand solely have recourse to, and make stay upon his doctrine that is your\nTeacher after the first order.  Yea, Mr. Recorder himself must not look\nfor life from that which he himself revealeth; his dependence for that\nmust be founded in the doctrine of the other preacher.  Let Mr. Recorder\nalso take heed that he receive not any doctrine, or point of doctrine,\nthat is not communicated to him by his Superior Teacher, nor yet within\nthe precincts of his own formal knowledge.’\n\nNow, after the Prince had thus settled things in the famous town of\nMansoul, he proceeded to give to the elders of the corporation a\nnecessary caution, to wit, how they should carry it to the high and noble\ncaptains that he had, from his Father’s court, sent or brought with him,\nto the famous town of Mansoul.\n\n‘These captains,’ said he, ‘do love the town of Mansoul, and they are\npicked men, picked out of abundance, as men that best suit, and that will\nmost faithfully serve in the wars of Shaddai against the Diabolonians,\nfor the preservation of the town of Mansoul.  ‘I charge you therefore,’\nsaid he, ‘O ye inhabitants of the now flourishing town of Mansoul, that\nyou carry it not ruggedly or untowardly to my captains, or their men;\nsince, as I said, they are picked and choice men—men chosen out of many\nfor the good of the town of Mansoul.  I say, I charge you, that you carry\nit not untowardly to them: for though they have the hearts and faces of\nlions, when at any time they shall be called forth to engage and fight\nwith the King’s foes, and the enemies of the town of Mansoul; yet a\nlittle discountenance cast upon them from the town of Mansoul will deject\nand cast down their faces, will weaken and take away their courage.  Do\nnot, therefore, O my beloved, carry it unkindly to my valiant captains\nand courageous men of war, but love them, nourish them, succour them, and\nlay them in your bosoms; and they will not only fight for you, but cause\nto fly from you all those the Diabolonians that seek, and will, if\npossible, be, your utter destruction.\n\n‘If, therefore, any of them should at any time be sick or weak, and so\nnot able to perform that office of love, which, with all their hearts,\nthey are willing to do (and will do also when well and in health), slight\nthem not, nor despise them, but rather strengthen them and encourage\nthem, though weak and ready to die, for they are your fence, and your\nguard, your wall, your gates, your locks, and your bars.  And although,\nwhen they are weak, they can do but little, but rather need to be helped\nby you, than that you should then expect great things from them, yet,\nwhen well, you know what exploits, what feats and warlike achievements\nthey are able to do, and will perform for you.\n\n‘Besides, if they be weak, the town of Mansoul cannot be strong; if they\nbe strong, then Mansoul cannot be weak; your safety, therefore, doth lie\nin their health, and in your countenancing them.  Remember, also, that if\nthey be sick, they catch that disease of the town of Mansoul itself.\n\n‘These things I have said unto you because I love your welfare and your\nhonour: observe, therefore, O my Mansoul, to be punctual in all things\nthat I have given in charge unto you, and that not only as a town\ncorporate, and so to your officers and guard, and guides in chief, but to\nyou as you are a people whose well-being, as single persons, depends on\nthe observation of the orders and commandments of their Lord.\n\n‘Next, O my Mansoul, I do warn you of that, of which, notwithstanding\nthat reformation that at present is wrought among you, you have need to\nbe warned about: wherefore hearken diligently unto me.  I am now sure,\nand you will know hereafter, that there are yet of the Diabolonians\nremaining in the town of Mansoul, Diabolonians that are sturdy and\nimplacable, and that do already while I am with you, and that will yet\nmore when I am from you, study, plot, contrive, invent, and jointly\nattempt to bring you to desolation, and so to a state far worse than that\nof the Egyptian bondage; they are the avowed friends of Diabolus,\ntherefore look about you.  They used heretofore to lodge with their\nPrince in the Castle, when Incredulity was the Lord Mayor of this town;\nbut since my coming hither, they lie more in the outsides and walls, and\nhave made themselves dens, and caves, and holes, and strongholds therein.\nWherefore, O Mansoul! thy work, as to this, will be so much the more\ndifficult and hard; that is, to take, mortify, and put them to death\naccording to the will of my Father.  Nor can you utterly rid yourselves\nof them, unless you should pull down the walls of your town, the which I\nam by no means willing you should.  Do you ask me, What shall we do then?\nWhy, be you diligent, and quit you like men; observe their holes; find\nout their haunts; assault them, and make no peace with them.  Wherever\nthey haunt, lurk, or abide, and what terms of peace soever they offer\nyou, abhor, and all shall be well betwixt you and me.  And that you may\nthe better know them from those that are the natives of Mansoul, I will\ngive you this brief schedule of the names of the chief of them; and they\nare these that follow:—The Lord Fornication, the Lord Adultery, the Lord\nMurder, the Lord Anger, the Lord Lasciviousness, the Lord Deceit, the\nLord Evil-Eye, Mr. Drunkenness, Mr. Revelling, Mr. Idolatry, Mr.\nWitch-craft, Mr. Variance, Mr. Emulation, Mr. Wrath, Mr. Strife, Mr.\nSedition, and Mr. Heresy.  These are some of the chief, O Mansoul! of\nthose that will seek to overthrow thee for ever.  These, I say, are the\nskulkers in Mansoul; but look thou well into the law of thy King, and\nthere thou shalt find their physiognomy, and such other characteristical\nnotes of them, by which they certainly may be known.\n\n‘These, O my Mansoul, (and I would gladly that you should certainly know\nit,) if they be suffered to run and range about the town as they would,\nwill quickly, like vipers, eat out your bowels; yea, poison your\ncaptains, cut the sinews of your soldiers, break the bars and bolts of\nyour gates, and turn your now most flourishing Mansoul into a barren and\ndesolate wilderness, and ruinous heap.  Wherefore, that you may take\ncourage to yourselves to apprehend these villains wherever you find them,\nI give to you, my Lord Mayor, my Lord Willbewill, and Mr. Recorder, with\nall the inhabitants of the town of Mansoul, full power and commission to\nseek out, to take, and to cause to be put to death by the cross, all, and\nall manner of Diabolonians, when and wherever you shall find them to lurk\nwithin, or to range without the walls of the town of Mansoul.\n\n‘I told you before that I had placed a standing ministry among you; not\nthat you have but these with you, for my first four captains who came\nagainst the master and lord of the Diabolonians that was in Mansoul, they\ncan, and if need be, and if they be required, will not only privately\ninform, but publicly preach to the corporation both good and wholesome\ndoctrine, and such as shall lead you in the way.  Yea, they will set up a\nweekly, yea, if need be, a daily lecture in thee, O Mansoul! and will\ninstruct thee in such profitable lessons, that, if heeded, will do thee\ngood at the end.  And take good heed that you spare not the men that you\nhave a commission to take and crucify.\n\n‘Now, as I have set before your eyes the vagrants and runagates by name,\nso I will tell you, that among yourselves, some of them shall creep in to\nbeguile you, even such as would seem, and that in appearance are, very\nrife and hot for religion.  And they, if you watch not, will do you a\nmischief, such an one as at present you cannot think of.\n\n‘These, as I said, will show themselves to you in another hue than those\nunder description before.  Wherefore, Mansoul, watch and be sober, and\nsuffer not thyself to be betrayed.’\n\nWhen the Prince had thus far new modelled the town of Mansoul, and had\ninstructed them in such matters as were profitable for them to know, then\nhe appointed another day in which he intended, when the townsfolk came\ntogether, to bestow a further badge of honour upon the town of Mansoul,—a\nbadge that should distinguish them from all the people, kindreds, and\ntongues that dwell in the kingdom of Universe.  Now it was not long\nbefore the day appointed was come, and the Prince and his people met in\nthe King’s palace, where first Emmanuel made a short speech unto them,\nand then did for them as he had said, and unto them as he had promised.\n\n‘My Mansoul,’ said he, ‘that which I now am about to do, is to make you\nknown to the world to be mine, and to distinguish you also in your own\neyes, from all false traitors that may creep in among you.’\n\nThen he commanded that those that waited upon him should go and bring\nforth out of his treasury those white and glistening robes ‘that I,’ said\nhe, ‘have provided and laid up in store for my Mansoul.’  So the white\ngarments were fetched out of his treasury, and laid forth to the eyes of\nthe people.  Moreover, it was granted to them that they should take them\nand put them on, ‘according,’ said he, ‘to your size and stature.’  So\nthe people were put into white, into fine linen, white and clean.\n\nThen said the Prince unto them, ‘This, O Mansoul, is my livery, and the\nbadge by which mine are known from the servants of others.  Yea, it is\nthat which I grant to all that are mine, and without which no man is\npermitted to see my face.  Wear them, therefore, for my sake, who gave\nthem unto you; and also if you would be known by the world to be mine.’\n\nBut now! can you think how Mansoul shone?  It was fair as the sun, clear\nas the moon, and terrible as an army with banners.\n\nThe Prince added further, and said, ‘No prince, potentate, or mighty one\nof Universe, giveth this livery but myself: behold, therefore, as I said\nbefore, you shall be known by it to be mine.\n\n‘And now,’ said he, ‘I have given you my livery, let me give you also in\ncommandment concerning them; and be sure that you take good heed to my\nwords.\n\n‘First.  Wear them daily, day by day, lest you should at sometimes appear\nto others as if you were none of mine.\n\n‘Second.  Keep them always white; for if they be soiled, it is dishonour\nto me.\n\n‘Third.  Wherefore gird them up from the ground, and let them not lag\nwith dust and dirt.\n\n‘Fourth.  Take heed that you lose them not, lest you walk naked, and they\nsee your shame.\n\n‘Fifth.  But if you should sully them, if you should defile them, the\nwhich I am greatly unwilling you should, and the prince Diabolus will be\nglad if you would, then speed you to do that which is written in my law,\nthat yet you may stand, and befall before me, and before my throne.\nAlso, this is the way to cause that I may not leave you, nor forsake you\nwhile here, but may dwell in this town of Mansoul for ever.’\n\nAnd now was Mansoul, and the inhabitants of it, as the signet upon\nEmmanuel’s right hand.  Where was there now a town, a city, a\ncorporation, that could compare with Mansoul! a town redeemed from the\nhand, and from the power of Diabolus! a town that the King Shaddai loved,\nand that he sent Emmanuel to regain from the Prince of the infernal cave;\nyea, a town that Emmanuel loved to dwell in, and that he chose for his\nroyal habitation; a town that he fortified for himself, and made strong\nby the force of his army.  What shall I say, Mansoul has now a most\nexcellent Prince, golden captains and men of war, weapons proved, and\ngarments as white as snow.  Nor are these benefits to be counted little,\nbut great; can the town of Mansoul esteem them so, and improve them to\nthat end and purpose for which they are bestowed upon them?\n\nWhen the Prince had thus completed the modelling of the town, to show\nthat he had great delight in the work of his hands and took pleasure in\nthe good that he had wrought for the famous and flourishing Mansoul, he\ncommanded, and they set his standard upon the battlements of the castle.\nAnd then,\n\nFirst.  He gave them frequent visits; not a day now but the elders of\nMansoul must come to him, or he to them, into his palace.  Now they must\nwalk and talk together of all the great things that he had done, and yet\nfurther promised to do, for the town of Mansoul.  Thus would he often do\nwith the Lord Mayor, my Lord Willbewill, and the honest subordinate\npreacher Mr. Conscience, and Mr. Recorder.  But oh, how graciously, how\nlovingly, how courteously, and tenderly did this blessed Prince now carry\nit towards the town of Mansoul!  In all the streets, gardens, orchards,\nand other places where he came, to be sure the poor should have his\nblessing and benediction; yea, he would kiss them, and if they were ill\nhe would lay hands on them, and make them well.  The captains, also, he\nwould daily, yea, sometimes hourly, encourage with his presence and\ngoodly words.  For you must know that a smile from him upon them would\nput more vigour, more life, and stoutness into them, than would anything\nelse under heaven.\n\nThe Prince would now also feast them, and be with them continually:\nhardly a week would pass but a banquet must be had betwixt him and them.\nYou may remember that, some pages before, we make mention of one feast\nthat they had together; but now to feast them was a thing more common:\nevery day with Mansoul was a feast-day now.  Nor did he, when they\nreturned to their places, send them empty away, either they must have a\nring, a gold chain, a bracelet, a white stone, or something; so dear was\nMansoul to him now; so lovely was Mansoul in his eyes.\n\nSecond.  When the elders and townsmen did not come to him, he would send\nin much plenty of provision unto them; meat that came from court, wine\nand bread that were prepared for his Father’s table; yea, such delicates\nwould he send unto them, and therewith would so cover their table, that\nwhoever saw it confessed that the like could not be seen in any kingdom.\n\nThird.  If Mansoul did not frequently visit him as he desired they\nshould, he would walk out to them, knock at their doors, and desire\nentrance, that amity might be maintained betwixt them and him; if they\ndid hear and open to him, as commonly they would, if they were at home,\nthen would he renew his former love, and confirm it too with some new\ntokens, and signs of continued favour.\n\nAnd was it not now amazing to behold, that in that very place where\nsometimes Diabolus had his abode, and entertained his Diabolonians to the\nalmost utter destruction of Mansoul, the Prince of princes should sit\neating and drinking with them, while all his mighty captains, men of war,\ntrumpeters, with the singing-men and singing-women of his Father, stood\nround about to wait upon them!  Now did Mansoul’s cup run over, now did\nher conduits run sweet wine, now did she eat the finest of the wheat, and\ndrink milk and honey out of the rock!  Now, she said, How great is his\ngoodness! for since I found favour in his eyes, how honourable have I\nbeen!\n\nThe blessed Prince did also ordain a new officer in the town, and a\ngoodly person he was; his name was Mr. God’s-Peace: this man was set over\nmy Lord Willbewill, my Lord Mayor, Mr. Recorder, the subordinate\npreacher, Mr. Mind, and over all the natives of the town of Mansoul.\nHimself was not a native of it, but came with the Prince Emmanuel from\nthe court.  He was a great acquaintance of Captain Credence and Captain\nGood-Hope; some say they were kin, and I am of that opinion too.  This\nman, as I said, was made governor of the town in general, especially over\nthe castle, and Captain Credence was to help him there.  And I made great\nobservation of it, that so long as all things went in Mansoul as this\nsweet-natured gentleman would, the town was in most happy condition.  Now\nthere were no jars, no chiding, no interferings, no unfaithful doings in\nall the town of Mansoul; every man in Mansoul kept close to his own\nemployment.  The gentry, the officers, the soldiers, and all in place\nobserved their order.  And as for the women and children of the town,\nthey followed their business joyfully; they would work and sing, work and\nsing, from morning till night: so that quite through the town of Mansoul\nnow nothing was to be found but harmony, quietness, joy, and health.  And\nthis lasted all that summer.\n\nBut there was a man in the town of Mansoul, and his name was Mr.\nCarnal-Security; this man did, after all this mercy bestowed on this\ncorporation, bring the town of Mansoul into great and grievous slavery\nand bondage.  A brief account of him and of his doings take as\nfolloweth:—\n\nWhen Diabolus at first took possession of the town of Mansoul, he brought\nthither, with himself, a great number of Diabolonians, men of his own\nconditions.  Now among these there was one whose name was Mr.\nSelf-Conceit, and a notable brisk man he was, as any that in those days\ndid possess the town of Mansoul.  Diabolus, then, perceiving this man to\nbe active and bold, sent him upon many desperate designs, the which he\nmanaged better, and more to the pleasing of his lord, than most that came\nwith him from the dens could do.  Wherefore, finding him so fit for his\npurpose, he preferred him, and made him next to the great Lord\nWillbewill, of whom we have written so much before.  Now the Lord\nWillbewill being in those days very well pleased with him, and with his\nachievements, gave him his daughter, the Lady Fear-Nothing, to wife.\nNow, of my Lady Fear-nothing, did this Mr. Self-Conceit beget this\ngentleman, Mr. Carnal-Security.  Wherefore, there being then in Mansoul\nthose strange kinds of mixtures, it was hard for them, in some cases, to\nfind out who were natives, who not, for Mr. Carnal-Security sprang from\nmy Lord Willbewill by mother’s side, though he had for his father a\nDiabolonian by nature.\n\nWell, this Carnal-Security took much after his father and mother; he was\nself-conceited, he feared nothing, he was also a very busy man: nothing\nof news, nothing of doctrine, nothing of alteration, or talk of\nalteration, could at any time be on foot in Mansoul, but be sure Mr.\nCarnal-Security would be at the head or tail of it: but, to be sure, he\nwould decline those that he deemed the weakest, and stood always with\nthem in his way of standing, that he supposed was the strongest side.\n\nNow, when Shaddai the mighty, and Emmanuel his Son, made war upon\nMansoul, to take it, this Mr. Carnal-Security was then in town, and was a\ngreat doer among the people, encouraging them in their rebellion, putting\nthem upon hardening themselves in their resisting the King’s forces: but\nwhen he saw that the town of Mansoul was taken, and converted to the use\nof the glorious Prince Emmanuel; and when he also saw what was become of\nDiabolus, and how he was unroosted, and made to quit the castle in the\ngreatest contempt and scorn; and that the town of Mansoul was well lined\nwith captains, engines of war, and men, and also provision; what doth he\nbut slyly wheel about also; and as he had served Diabolus against the\ngood Prince, so he feigned that he would serve the Prince against his\nfoes.\n\nAnd having got some little smattering of Emmanuel’s things by the end,\nbeing bold, he ventures himself into the company of the townsmen, any\nattempts also to chat among them.  Now he knew that the power and\nstrength of the town of Mansoul was great, and that it could not but be\npleasing to the people, if he cried up their might and their glory.\nWherefore he beginneth his tale with the power and strength of Mansoul,\nand affirmed that it was impregnable; now magnifying their captains and\ntheir slings, and their rams; then crying up their fortifications and\nstrongholds; and, lastly, the assurances that they had from their Prince,\nthat Mansoul should be happy for ever.  But when he saw that some of the\nmen of the town were tickled and taken with his discourse, he makes it\nhis business, and walking from street to street, house to house, and man\nto man, he at last brought Mansoul to dance after his pipe, and to grow\nalmost as carnally secure as himself; so from talking they went to\nfeasting, and from feasting to sporting; and so to some other matters.\nNow Emmanuel was yet in the town of Mansoul, and he wisely observed their\ndoings.  My Lord Mayor, my Lord Willbewill, and Mr. Recorder were also\nall taken with the words of this tattling Diabolonian gentleman,\nforgetting that their Prince had given them warning before to take heed\nthat they were not beguiled with any Diabolonian sleight; he had further\ntold them that the security of the now flourishing town of Mansoul did\nnot so much lie in her present fortifications and force, as in her so\nusing of what she had, as might oblige her Emmanuel to abide within her\ncastle.  For the right doctrine of Emmanuel was, that the town of Mansoul\nshould take heed that they forgot not his Father’s love and his; also,\nthat they should so demean themselves as to continue to keep themselves\ntherein.  Now this was not the way to do it, namely, to fall in love with\none of the Diabolonians, and with such an one too as Mr. Carnal-Security\nwas, and to be led up and down by the nose by him; they should have heard\ntheir Prince, feared their Prince, loved their Prince, and have stoned\nthis naughty pack to death, and took care to have walked in the ways of\ntheir Prince’s prescribing: for then should their peace have been as a\nriver, when their righteousness had been like the waves of the sea.\n\nNow when Emmanuel perceived that through the policy of Mr.\nCarnal-Security the hearts of the men of Mansoul were chilled and abated\nin their practical love to him,\n\nFirst.  He bemoans them, and, condoles their state with the Secretary,\nsaying, ‘Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and that Mansoul had\nwalked in my ways!  I would have fed them with the finest of the wheat;\nand with honey out of the rock would I have sustained them.’  This done,\nhe said in his heart, ‘I will return to the court, and go to my place,\ntill Mansoul shall consider and acknowledge their offence.’  And he did\nso, and the cause and manner of his going away from them was, that\nMansoul declined him, as is manifest in these particulars.\n\n‘1. They left off their former way of visiting him, they came not to his\nroyal palace as afore.\n\n‘2. They did not regard, nor yet take notice, that he came or came not to\nvisit them.\n\n‘3. The love-feasts that had wont to be between their Prince and them,\nthough he made them still, and called them to them, yet they neglected to\ncome to them, or to be delighted with them.\n\n‘4. They waited not for his counsels, but began to be headstrong and\nconfident in themselves, concluding that now they were strong and\ninvincible, and that Mansoul was secure, and beyond all reach of the foe,\nand that her state must needs be unalterable for ever.’\n\nNow, as was said, Emmanuel perceiving that by the craft of Mr.\nCarnal-Security, the town of Mansoul was taken off from their dependence\nupon him, and upon his Father by him, and set upon what by them was\nbestowed upon it; he first, as I said, bemoaned their state, then he used\nmeans to make them understand that the way that they went on in was\ndangerous: for he sent my Lord High Secretary to them, to forbid them\nsuch ways; but twice when he came to them, he found them at dinner in Mr.\nCarnal-Security’s parlour; and perceiving also that they were not willing\nto reason about matters concerning their good, he took grief and went his\nway; the which when he had told to the Prince Emmanuel, he took offence,\nand was grieved also, and so made provision to return to his Father’s\ncourt.\n\nNow, the methods of his withdrawing, as I was saying before, were thus:—\n\n‘1. Even while he was yet with them in Mansoul, he kept himself close,\nand more retired than formerly.\n\n‘2. His speech was not now, if he came in their company, so pleasant and\nfamiliar as formerly.\n\n‘3. Nor did he, as in times past, send to Mansoul, from his table, those\ndainty bits which he was wont to do.\n\n‘4. Nor when they came to visit him, as now and then they would, would he\nbe so easily spoken with as they found him to be in times past.  They\nmight now knock once, yea, twice, but he would seem not at all to regard\nthem; whereas formerly at the sound of their feet he would up and run,\nand meet them halfway, and take them too, and lay them in his bosom.’\n\nBut thus Emmanuel carried it now, and by this his carriage he sought to\nmake them bethink themselves, and return to him.  But, alas! they did not\nconsider, they did not know his ways, they regarded not, they were not\ntouched with these, nor with the true remembrance of former favours.\nWherefore what does he but in private manner withdraw himself, first from\nhis palace, then to the gate of the town, and so away from Mansoul he\ngoes, till they should acknowledge their offence, and more earnestly seek\nhis face.  Mr. God’s-Peace also laid down his commission, and would for\nthe present act no longer in the town of Mansoul.\n\nThus they walked contrary to him, and he again, by way of retaliation,\nwalked contrary to them.  But, alas! by this time they were so hardened\nin their way, and had so drunk in the doctrine of Mr. Carnal-Security,\nthat the departing of their Prince touched them not, nor was he\nremembered by them when gone; and so, of consequence, his absence not\ncondoled by them.\n\nNow, there was a day wherein this old gentleman, Mr. Carnal-Security, did\nagain make a feast for the town of Mansoul; and there was at that time in\nthe town one Mr. Godly-Fear, one now but little set by, though formerly\none of great request.  This man, old Carnal-Security, had a mind, if\npossible, to gull, and debauch, and abuse, as he did the rest, and\ntherefore he now bids him to the feast with his neighbours.  So the day\nbeing come, they prepare, and he goes and appears with the rest of the\nguests; and being all set at the table, they did eat and drink, and were\nmerry, even all but this one man: for Mr. Godly-Fear sat like a stranger,\nand did neither eat nor was merry.  The which, when Mr. Carnal-Security\nperceived, he presently addressed himself in a speech thus to him:—\n\n‘Mr. Godly-Fear, are you not well?  You seem to be ill of body or mind,\nor both.  I have a cordial of Mr. Forget-Good’s making, the which, sir,\nif you will take a dram of, I hope it may make you bonny and blithe, and\nso make you more fit for us, feasting companions.’\n\nUnto whom the good old gentleman discreetly replied, ‘Sir, I thank you\nfor all things courteous and civil; but for your cordial I have no list\nthereto.  But a word to the natives of Mansoul: You, the elders and chief\nof Mansoul, to me it is strange to see you so jocund and merry, when the\ntown of Mansoul is in such woeful case.’\n\nThen said Mr. Carnal-Security, ‘You want sleep, good air, I doubt.  If\nyou please, lie down, and take a nap, and we meanwhile will be merry.’\n\nThen said the good man as follows: ‘Sir, if you were not destitute of an\nhonest heart, you could not do as you have done and do.’\n\nThen said Mr. Carnal-Security, ‘Why?’\n\n_Godly_.  Nay, pray interrupt me not.  It is true the town of Mansoul was\nstrong, and, with a _proviso_, impregnable; but you, the townsmen, have\nweakened it, and it now lies obnoxious to its foes.  Nor is it a time to\nflatter, or be silent; it is you, Mr. Carnal-Security, that have wilily\nstripped Mansoul, and driven her glory from her; you have pulled down her\ntowers, you have broken down her gates, you have spoiled her locks and\nbars.\n\nAnd now, to explain myself: from that time that my lords of Mansoul, and\nyou, sir, grew so great, from that time the Strength of Mansoul has been\noffended, and now he is arisen and is gone.  If any shall question the\ntruth of my words, I will answer him by this, and suchlike questions.\n‘Where is the Prince Emmanuel?  When did a man or woman in Mansoul see\nhim?  When did you hear from him, or taste any of his dainty bits?’  You\nare now a feasting with this Diabolonian monster, but he is not your\nPrince.  I say, therefore, though enemies from without, had you taken\nheed, could not have made a prey of you, yet since you have sinned\nagainst your Prince, your enemies within have been too hard for you.\n\nThen said Mr. Carnal-Security, ‘Fie! fie!  Mr. Godly-Fear, fie!—will you\nnever shake off your _timorousness_?  Are you afraid of being\nsparrow-blasted?  Who hath hurt you?  Behold, I am on your side; only you\nare for doubting, and I am for being confident.  Besides, is this a time\nto be sad in?  A feast is made for mirth; why, then, do you now, to your\nshame, and our trouble, break out into such passionate melancholy\nlanguage, when you should eat and drink, and be merry?’\n\nThen said Mr. Godly-Fear again, ‘I may well be sad, for Emmanuel is gone\nfrom Mansoul.  I say again, he is gone, and you, sir, are the man that\nhas driven him away; yea, he is gone without so much as acquainting the\nnobles of Mansoul with his going; and if that is not a sign of his anger,\nI am not acquainted with the methods of godliness.\n\n‘And now, my lords and gentlemen, for my speech is still to you, your\ngradual declining from him did provoke him gradually to depart from you,\nthe which he did for some time, if perhaps you would have been made\nsensible thereby, and have been renewed by humbling yourselves; but when\nhe saw that none would regard, nor lay these fearful beginnings of his\nanger and judgment to heart, he went away from this place; and this I saw\nwith mine eye.  Wherefore now, while you boast, your strength is gone;\nyou are like the man that had lost his locks that before did wave about\nhis shoulders.  You may, with this lord of your feast, shake yourselves,\nand conclude to do as at other times; but since without him you can do\nnothing, and he is departed from you, turn your feast into a sigh, and\nyour mirth into lamentation.’\n\nThen the subordinate preacher, old Mr. Conscience by name, he that of old\nwas Recorder of Mansoul, being startled at what was said, began to second\nit thus:—\n\n‘Indeed, my brethren,’ quoth he, ‘I fear that Mr. Godly-Fear tells us\ntrue: I, for my part, have not seen my Prince a long season.  I cannot\nremember the day, for my part; nor can I answer Mr. Godly-Fear’s\nquestion.  I doubt, I am afraid that all is nought with Mansoul.’\n\n_Godly_.  Nay, I know that you shall not find him in Mansoul, for he is\ndeparted and gone; yea, and gone for the faults of the elders, and for\nthat they rewarded his grace with unsufferable unkindness.\n\nThen did the subordinate preacher look as if he would fall down dead at\nthe table; also all there present, except the man of the house, began to\nlook pale and wan.  But having a little recovered themselves, and jointly\nagreeing to believe Mr. Godly-Fear and his sayings, they began to consult\nwhat was best to be done, (now Mr. Carnal-Security was gone into his\nwithdrawing-room, for he liked not such dumpish doings,) both to the man\nof the house for drawing them into evil, and also to recover Emmanuel’s\nlove.\n\nAnd, with that, that saying of their Prince came very hot into their\nminds, which he had bidden them do to such as were false prophets that\nshould arise to delude the town of Mansoul.  So they took Mr.\nCarnal-Security (concluding that he must be he) and burned his house upon\nhim with fire; for he also was a Diabolonian by nature.\n\nSo when this was passed and over, they bespeed themselves to look for\nEmmanuel their Prince; and they sought him, but they found him not.  Then\nwere they more confirmed in the truth of Mr. Godly-Fear’s sayings, and\nbegan also severely to reflect upon themselves for their so vile and\nungodly doings; for they concluded now that it was through them that\ntheir Prince had left them.\n\nThen they agreed and went to my Lord Secretary, (him whom before they\nrefused to hear—him whom they had grieved with their doings,) to know of\nhim, for he was a seer, and could tell where Emmanuel was, and how they\nmight direct a petition to him.  But the Lord Secretary would not admit\nthem to a conference about this matter, nor would admit them to his royal\nplace of abode, nor come out to them to show them his face or\nintelligence.\n\nAnd now was it a day gloomy and dark, a day of clouds and of thick\ndarkness with Mansoul.  Now they saw that they had been foolish, and\nbegan to perceive what the company and prattle of Mr. Carnal-Security had\ndone, and what desperate damage his swaggering words had brought poor\nMansoul into.  But what further it was likely to cost them they were\nignorant of.  Now Mr. Godly-Fear began again to be in repute with the men\nof the town; yea, they were ready to look upon him as a prophet.\n\nWell, when the Sabbath day was come, they went to hear their subordinate\npreacher; but oh, how he did thunder and lighten this day!  His text was\nthat in the prophet Jonah: ‘They that observe lying vanities forsake\ntheir own mercy.’  But there was then such power and authority in that\nsermon, and such a dejection seen in the countenances of the people that\nday, that the like hath seldom been heard or seen.  The people, when\nsermon was done, were scarce able to go to their homes, or to betake\nthemselves to their employs the week after; they were so sermon-smitten,\nand also so sermon-sick by being smitten, that they knew not what to do.\n\nHe did not only show to Mansoul their sin, but did tremble before them,\nunder the sense of his own, still crying out of himself, as he preached\nto them, ‘Unhappy man that I am! that I should do so wicked a thing!\nThat I, a preacher! whom the Prince did set up to teach to Mansoul his\nlaw, should myself live senseless and sottishly here, and be one of the\nfirst found in transgression!  This transgression also fell within my\nprecincts; I should have cried out against the wickedness; but I let\nMansoul lie wallowing in it, until it had driven Emmanuel from its\nborders!’  With these things he also charged all the lords and gentry of\nMansoul, to the almost distracting of them.\n\nAbout this time, also, there was a great sickness in the town of Mansoul,\nand most of the inhabitants were greatly afflicted.  Yea, the captains\nalso, and men of war, were brought thereby to a languishing condition,\nand that for a long time together; so that in case of an invasion,\nnothing could to purpose now have been done, either by the townsmen or\nfield officers.  Oh, how many pale faces, weak hands, feeble knees, and\nstaggering men were now seen to walk the streets of Mansoul!  Here were\ngroans, there pants, and yonder lay those that were ready to faint.\n\nThe garments, too, which Emmanuel had given them were but in a sorry\ncase; some were rent, some were torn, and all in a nasty condition; some\nalso did hang so loosely upon them, that the next bush they came at was\nready to pluck them off.\n\nAfter some time spent in this sad and desolate condition, the subordinate\npreacher called for a day of fasting, and to humble themselves for being\nso wicked against the great Shaddai and his Son.  And he desired that\nCaptain Boanerges would preach.  So he consented to do it; and the day\nbeing come, and his text was this, ‘Cut it down, why cumbereth it the\nground?’  And a very smart sermon he made upon the place.  First, he\nshowed what was the occasion of the words, namely, because the fig-tree\nwas barren; then he showed what was contained in the sentence, namely,\nrepentance, or utter desolation.  He then showed, also, by whose\nauthority this sentence was pronounced, and that was by Shaddai himself.\nAnd, lastly, he showed the reasons of the point, and then concluded his\nsermon.  But he was very pertinent in the application, insomuch that he\nmade poor Mansoul tremble.  For this sermon, as well as the former,\nwrought much upon the hearts of the men of Mansoul; yea, it greatly\nhelped to keep awake those that were roused by the preaching that went\nbefore.  So that now throughout the whole town, there was little or\nnothing to be heard or seen but sorrow, and mourning, and woe.\n\nNow, after sermon, they got together and consulted what was best to be\ndone.  ‘But,’ said the subordinate preacher, ‘I will do nothing of mine\nown head, without advising with my neighbour Mr. Godly-Fear.  For if he\nhad aforehand understood more of the mind of our Prince than we, I do not\nknow but he also may have it now, even now we are turning again to\nvirtue.’\n\nSo they called and sent for Mr. Godly-Fear, and he forthwith appeared.\nThen they desired that he would further show his opinion about what they\nhad best to do. Then said the old gentleman as followeth: ‘It is my\nopinion that this town of Mansoul should, in this day of her distress,\ndraw up and send an humble petition to their offended Prince Emmanuel,\nthat he, in his favour and grace, will turn again unto you, and not keep\nanger for ever.’\n\nWhen the townsmen had heard this speech, they did, with one consent,\nagree to his advice; so they did presently draw up their request, and the\nnext was, But who shall carry it?  At last they did all agree to send it\nby my Lord Mayor.  So he accepted of the service, and addressed himself\nto his journey; and went and came to the court of Shaddai, whither\nEmmanuel the Prince of Mansoul was gone.  But the gate was shut, and a\nstrict watch kept thereat; so that the petitioner was forced to stand\nwithout for a great while together.  Then he desired that some would go\ninto the Prince and tell him who stood at the gate, and what his business\nwas.  So one went and told to Shaddai, and to Emmanuel his Son, that the\nLord Mayor of the town of Mansoul stood without at the gate of the King’s\ncourt, desiring to be admitted into the presence of the Prince, the\nKing’s Son.  He also told what was the Lord Mayor’s errand, both to the\nKing and his Son Emmanuel.  But the Prince would not come down, nor admit\nthat the gate should be opened to him, but sent him an answer to this\neffect: ‘They have turned their back unto me, and not their face; but now\nin the time of their trouble they say to me, Arise, and save us.  But can\nthey not now go to Mr. Carnal-Security, to whom they went when they\nturned from me, and make him their leader, their lord, and their\nprotection now in their trouble; why now in their trouble do they visit\nme, since in their prosperity they went astray?’\n\nThe answer made my Lord Mayor look black in the face; it troubled, it\nperplexed, it rent him sore.  And now he began again to see what it was\nto be familiar with Diabolonians, such as Mr. Carnal-Security was.  When\nhe saw that at court, as yet, there was little help to be expected,\neither for himself or friends in Mansoul, he smote upon his breast, and\nreturned weeping, and all the way bewailing the lamentable state of\nMansoul.\n\nWell, when he was come within sight of the town, the elders and chief of\nthe people of Mansoul went out at the gate to meet him, and to salute\nhim, and to know how he sped at court.  But he told them his tale in so\ndoleful a manner, that they all cried out, and mourned, and wept.\nWherefore they threw ashes and dust upon their heads, and put sackcloth\nupon their loins, and went crying out through the town of Mansoul; the\nwhich, when the rest of the townsfolk saw, they all mourned and wept.\nThis, therefore, was a day of rebuke and trouble, and of anguish to the\ntown of Mansoul, and also of great distress.\n\nAfter some time, when they had somewhat refrained themselves, they came\ntogether to consult again what by them was yet to be done; and they asked\nadvice, as they did before, of that reverend Mr. Godly-Fear, who told\nthem that there was no way better than to do as they had done, nor would\nhe that they should be discouraged at all with that they had met with at\ncourt; yea, though several of their petitions should be answered with\nnought but silence or rebuke: ‘For,’ said he, ‘it is the way of the wise\nShaddai to make men wait and to exercise patience, and it should be the\nway of them in want, to be willing to stay his leisure.\n\nThen they took courage, and sent again and again, and again, and again;\nfor there was not now one day, nor an hour that went over Mansoul’s head,\nwherein a man might not have met upon the road one or other riding post,\nsounding the horn from Mansoul to the court of the King Shaddai; and all\nwith letters petitionary in behalf of, and for the Prince’s return to\nMansoul.  The road, I say, was now full of messengers, going and\nreturning, and meeting one another; some from the court, and some from\nMansoul; and this was the work of the miserable town of Mansoul, all that\nlong, that sharp, that cold and tedious winter.\n\nNow if you have not forgot, you may yet remember that I told you before,\nthat after Emmanuel had taken Mansoul, yea, and after that he had new\nmodelled the town, there remained in several lurking places of the\ncorporation many of the old Diabolonians, that either came with the\ntyrant when he invaded and took the town, or that had there, by reason of\nunlawful mixtures, their birth and breeding, and bringing up.  And their\nholes, dens, and lurking places were in, under, or about the wall of the\ntown.  Some of their names are the Lord Fornication, the Lord Adultery,\nthe Lord Murder, the Lord Anger, the Lord Lasciviousness, the Lord\nDeceit, the Lord Evil-eye, the Lord Blasphemy, and that horrible villain,\nthe old and dangerous Lord Covetousness.  These, as I told you, with many\nmore, had yet their abode in the town of Mansoul, and that after that\nEmmanuel had driven their prince Diabolus out of the castle.\n\nAgainst these the good Prince did grant a commission to the Lord\nWillbewill and others, yea, to the whole town of Mansoul, to seek, take,\nsecure, and destroy any or all that they could lay hands of, for that\nthey were Diabolonians by nature, enemies to the Prince, and those that\nsought to ruin the blessed town of Mansoul.  But the town of Mansoul did\nnot pursue this warrant, but neglected to look after, to apprehend, to\nsecure, and to destroy these Diabolonians.  Wherefore what do these\nvillains but by degrees take courage to put forth their heads, and to\nshow themselves to the inhabitants of the town.  Yea, and as I was told,\nsome of the men of Mansoul grew too familiar with some of them, to the\nsorrow of the corporation, as you yet will hear more of in time and\nplace.\n\nWell, when the Diabolonian lords that were left perceived that Mansoul\nhad, through sinning, offended Emmanuel their Prince, and that he had\nwithdrawn himself and was gone, what do they but plot the ruin of the\ntown of Mansoul.  So upon a time they met together at the hold of one Mr.\nMischief, who was also a Diabolonian, and there consulted how they might\ndeliver up Mansoul into the hands of Diabolus again.  Now some advised\none way, and some another, every man according to his own liking.  At\nlast my Lord Lasciviousness propounded, whether it might not be best, in\nthe first place, for some of those that were Diabolonians in Mansoul, to\nadventure to offer themselves for servants to some of the natives of the\ntown; ‘for,’ said he, ‘if they so do, and Mansoul shall accept of them,\nthey may for us, and for Diabolus our Lord, make the taking of the town\nof Mansoul more easy than otherwise it will be.’  But then stood up the\nLord Murder, and said, ‘This may not be done at this time; for Mansoul is\nnow in a kind of a rage, because by our friend, Mr. Carnal-Security, she\nhath been once ensnared already, and made to offend against her Prince;\nand how shall she reconcile herself unto her lord again, but by the heads\nof these men?  Besides, we know that they have in commission to take and\nslay us wherever they shall find us; let us, therefore, be wise as foxes:\nwhen we are dead, we can do them no hurt; but while we live, we may.’\nThus, when they had tossed the matter to and fro, they jointly agreed\nthat a letter should forthwith be sent away to Diabolus in their name, by\nwhich the state of the town of Mansoul should be showed him, and how much\nit is under the frowns of their Prince.  ‘We may also,’ said some, ‘let\nhim know our intentions, and ask of him his advice in the case.’\n\nSo a letter was presently framed, the contents of which were these:—\n\n‘To our great lord, the Prince Diabolus, dwelling below in the infernal\ncave:\n\n‘O great father, and mighty Prince Diabolus, we, the true Diabolonians\nyet remaining in the rebellious town of Mansoul, having received our\nbeings from thee, and our nourishment at thy hands, cannot with content\nand quiet endure to behold, as we do this day, how thou art dispraised,\ndisgraced, and reproached among the inhabitants of this town; nor is thy\nlong absence at all delightful to us, because greatly to our detriment.\n\n‘The reason of this our writing unto our lord, is for that we are not\naltogether without hope that this town may become thy habitation again;\nfor it is greatly declined from its Prince Emmanuel; and he is uprisen,\nand is departed from them: yea, and though they send, and send, and send,\nand send after him to return to them, yet can they not prevail, nor get\ngood words from him.\n\n‘There has been also of late, and is yet remaining, a very great sickness\nand fainting among them; and that not only upon the poorer sort of the\ntown, but upon the lords, captains, and chief gentry of the place, (we\nonly who are of the Diabolonians by nature remain well, lively, and\nstrong,) so that through their great transgression on the one hand, and\ntheir dangerous sickness on the other, we judge they lie open to thy hand\nand power.  If, therefore, it shall stand with thy horrible cunning, and\nwith the cunning of the rest of the princes with thee, to come and make\nan attempt to take Mansoul again, send us word, and we shall to our\nutmost power be ready to deliver it into thy hand.  Or if what we have\nsaid shall not by thy fatherhood be thought best and most meet to be\ndone, send us thy mind in a few words, and we are all ready to follow thy\ncounsel to the hazarding of our lives, and what else we have.\n\n‘Given under our hands the day and date above-written, after a close\nconsultation at the house of Mr. Mischief, who yet is alive and hath his\nplace in our desirable town of Mansoul.’\n\nWhen Mr. Profane (for he was the carrier) was come with his letter to\nHell-Gate Hill, he knocked at the brazen gates for entrance.  Then did\nCerberus, the porter, for he is the keeper of that gate, open to Mr.\nProfane, to whom he delivered his letter, which he had brought from the\nDiabolonians in Mansoul.  So he carried it in, and presented it to\nDiabolus his lord, and said, ‘Tidings, my lord, from Mansoul, from our\ntrusty friends in Mansoul.’\n\nThen came together from all places of the den Beelzebub, Lucifer,\nApollyon, with the rest of the rabblement there, to hear what news from\nMansoul.  So the letter was broken up and read, and Cerberus he stood by.\nWhen the letter was openly read, and the contents thereof spread into all\nthe corners of the den, command was given that, without let or stop,\ndead-man’s bell should be rung for joy.  So the bell was rung, and the\nprinces rejoiced that Mansoul was likely to come to ruin.  Now, the\nclapper of the bell went, ‘The town of Mansoul is coming to dwell with\nus: make room for the town of Mansoul.’  This bell therefore they did\nring, because they did hope that they should have Mansoul again.\n\nNow, when they had performed this their horrible ceremony, they got\ntogether again to consult what answer to send to their friends in\nMansoul; and some advised one thing, and some another: but at length,\nbecause the business required haste, they left the whole business to the\nprince Diabolus, judging him the most proper lord of the place.  So he\ndrew up a letter as he thought fit, in answer to what Mr. Profane had\nbrought, and sent it to the Diabolonians that did dwell in Mansoul, by\nthe same hand that had brought theirs to him; and these were the contents\nthereof:—\n\n‘To our offspring, the high and mighty Diabolonians that yet dwell in the\ntown of Mansoul, Diabolus, the great prince of Mansoul, wisheth a\nprosperous issue and conclusion of those many brave enterprises,\nconspiracies, and designs, that you, of your love and respect to our\nhonour, have in your hearts to attempt to do against Mansoul.  Beloved\nchildren and disciples, my Lord Fornication, Adultery, and the rest, we\nhave here, in our desolate den, received, to our highest joy and content,\nyour welcome letter, by the hand of our trusty Mr. Profane; and to show\nhow acceptable your tidings were, we rang out our bell for gladness; for\nwe rejoiced as much as we could, when we perceived that yet we had\nfriends in Mansoul, and such as sought our honour and revenge in the ruin\nof the town of Mansoul.  We also rejoiced to hear that they are in a\ndegenerated condition, and that they have offended their Prince, and that\nhe is gone.  Their sickness also pleaseth us, as does also your health,\nmight, and strength.  Glad also would we be, right horribly beloved,\ncould we get this town into our clutches again.  Nor will we be sparing\nof spending our wit, our cunning, our craft, and hellish inventions to\nbring to a wished conclusion this your brave beginning in order thereto.\n\n‘And take this for your comfort, (our birth, and our offspring,) that\nshall we again surprise it and take it, we will attempt to put all your\nfoes to the sword, and will make you the great lords and captains of the\nplace.  Nor need you fear, if ever we get it again, that we after that\nshall be cast out any more; for we will come with more strength, and so\nlay far more fast hold than at the first we did.  Besides, it is the law\nof that Prince that now they own, that if we get them a second time, they\nshall be ours for ever.\n\n‘Do you, therefore, our trusty Diabolonians, yet more pry into, and\nendeavour to spy out the weakness of the town of Mansoul.  We also would\nthat you yourselves do attempt to weaken them more and more.  Send us\nword also by what means you think we had best to attempt the regaining\nthereof: namely, whether by persuasion to a vain and loose life; or,\nwhether by tempting them to doubt and despair; or, whether by blowing up\nof the town by the gunpowder of pride, and self-conceit.  Do you also, O\nye brave Diabolonians, and true sons of the pit, be always in a readiness\nto make a most hideous assault within, when we shall be ready to storm it\nwithout.  Now speed you in your project, and we in our desires, to the\nutmost power of our gates, which is the wish of your great Diabolus,\nMansoul’s enemy, and him that trembles when he thinks of judgment to\ncome.  All the blessings of the pit be upon you, and so we close up our\nletter.\n\n‘Given at the pit’s mouth, by the joint consent of all the princes of\ndarkness, to be sent, to the force and power that we have yet remaining\nin Mansoul, by the hand of Mr. Profane, by me, Diabolus.’\n\nThis letter, as was said, was sent to Mansoul, to the Diabolonians that\nyet remained there, and that yet inhabited the wall, from the dark\ndungeon of Diabolus, by the hand of Mr. Profane, by whom they also in\nMansoul sent theirs to the pit.  Now, when this Mr. Profane had made his\nreturn, and was come to Mansoul again, he went and came as he was wont to\nthe house of Mr. Mischief, for there was the conclave, and the place\nwhere the contrivers were met.  Now, when they saw that their messenger\nwas returned safe and sound, they were greatly gladded thereat.  Then he\npresented them with his letter which he had brought from Diabolus for\nthem; the which, when they had read and considered, did much augment\ntheir gladness.  They asked him after the welfare of their friends, as\nhow their Lord Diabolus, Lucifer, and Beelzebub did, with the rest of\nthose of the den.  To which this Profane made answer, ‘Well, well, my\nlords; they are well, even as well as can be in their place.  They also,’\nsaid he, ‘did ring for joy at the reading of your letter, as you well\nperceived by this when you read it.’\n\nNow, as was said, when they had read their letter, and perceived that it\nencouraged them in their work, they fell to their way of contriving\nagain, namely, how they might complete their Diabolonian design upon\nMansoul.  And the first thing that they agreed upon was to keep all\nthings from Mansoul as close as they could.  ‘Let it not be known, let\nnot Mansoul be acquainted with what we design against it.’  The next\nthing was, how, or by what means, they should try to bring to pass the\nruin and overthrow of Mansoul; and one said after this manner, and\nanother said after that.  Then stood up Mr. Deceit, and said, ‘My right\nDiabolonian friends, our lords, and the high ones of the deep dungeon, do\npropound unto us these three ways.\n\n‘1. Whether we had best to seek its ruin by making Mansoul loose and\nvain.\n\n‘2. Or whether by driving them to doubt and despair.\n\n‘3. Or whether by endeavouring to blow them up by the gunpowder of pride\nand self-conceit.\n\n‘Now, I think, if we shall tempt them to pride, that may do something;\nand if we tempt them to wantonness, that may help.  But, in my mind, if\nwe could drive them into desperation, that would knock the nail on the\nhead; for then we should have them, in the first place, question the\ntruth of the love of the heart of their Prince towards them, and that\nwill disgust him much.  This, if it works well, will make them leave off\nquickly their way of sending petitions to him; then farewell earnest\nsolicitations for help and supply; for then this conclusion lies\nnaturally before them, “As good do nothing, as do to no purpose.”’  So to\nMr. Deceit they unanimously did consent.\n\nThen the next question was, But how shall we do to bring this our project\nto pass? and it was answered by the same gentleman—that this might be the\nbest way to do it: ‘Even let,’ quoth he, ‘so many of our friends as are\nwilling to venture themselves for the promoting of their prince’s cause,\ndisguise themselves with apparel, change their names, and go into the\nmarket like far country-men, and proffer to let themselves for servants\nto the famous town of Mansoul, and let them pretend to do for their\nmasters as beneficially as may be; for by so doing they may, if Mansoul\nshall hire them, in little time so corrupt and defile the corporation,\nthat her now Prince shall be not only further offended with them, but in\nconclusion shall spue them out of his mouth.  And when this is done, our\nprince Diabolus shall prey upon them with ease: yea, of themselves they\nshall fall into the mouth of the eater.’\n\nThis project was no sooner propounded, but was as highly accepted, and\nforward were all Diabolonians now to engage in so delicate an enterprise:\nbut it was not thought fit that all should do thus; wherefore they\npitched upon two or three, namely, the Lord Covetousness, the Lord\nLasciviousness, and the Lord Anger.  The Lord Covetousness called himself\nby the name of Prudent-Thrifty; the Lord Lasciviousness called himself by\nthe name of Harmless-Mirth; and the Lord Anger called himself by the name\nof Good-Zeal.\n\nSo upon a market-day they came into the market-place, three lusty fellows\nthey were to look on, and they were clothed in sheep’s russet, which was\nalso now in a manner as white as were the white robes of the men of\nMansoul.  Now the men could speak the language of Mansoul well.  So when\nthey were come into the market-place, and had offered to let themselves\nto the townsmen, they were presently taken up; for they asked but little\nwages, and promised to do their masters great service.\n\nMr. Mind hired Prudent-Thrifty, and Mr. Godly-Fear hired Good-Zeal.\nTrue, this fellow Harmless-Mirth did hang a little in hand, and could not\nso soon get him a master as the others did, because the town of Mansoul\nwas now in Lent, but after a while, because Lent was almost out, the Lord\nWillbewill hired Harmless-Mirth to be both his waiting man and his\nlackey: and thus they got them masters.\n\nThese villains now being got thus far into the houses of the men of\nMansoul, quickly began to do great mischief therein; for, being filthy,\narch, and sly, they quickly corrupted the families where they were; yea,\nthey tainted their masters much, especially this Prudent-Thrifty, and him\nthey call Harmless-Mirth.  True, he that went under the visor of\nGood-Zeal, was not so well liked of his master; for he quickly found that\nhe was but a counterfeit rascal; the which when the fellow perceived,\nwith speed he made his escape from the house, or I doubt not but his\nmaster had hanged him.\n\nWell, when these vagabonds had thus far carried on their design, and had\ncorrupted the town as much as they could, in the next place they\nconsidered with themselves at what time their prince Diabolus without,\nand themselves within the town, should make an attempt to seize upon\nMansoul; and they all agreed upon this, that a market-day would be best\nfor that work; for why?  Then will the townsfolk be busy in their ways:\nand always take this for a rule, when people are most busy in the world,\nthey least fear a surprise.  ‘We also then,’ said they, ‘shall be able\nwith less suspicion to gather ourselves together for the work of our\nfriends and lords; yea, and in such a day, if we shall attempt our work,\nand miss it, we may, when they shall give us the rout, the better hide\nourselves in the crowd, and escape.’\n\nThese things being thus far agreed upon by them, they wrote another\nletter to Diabolus, and sent it by the hand to Mr. Profane, the contents\nof which were these:—\n\n‘The lords of Looseness send to the great and high Diabolus from our\ndens, caves, holes, and strongholds, in and about the wall of the town of\nMansoul, greeting:\n\n‘Our great lord, and the nourisher of our lives, Diabolus—how glad we\nwere when we heard of your fatherhood’s readiness to comply with us, and\nhelp forward our design in our attempts to ruin Mansoul, none can tell\nbut those who, as we do, set themselves against all appearance of good,\nwhen and wheresoever we find it.\n\n‘Touching the encouragement that your greatness is pleased to give us to\ncontinue to devise, contrive, and study the utter desolation of Mansoul,\nthat we are not solicitous about: for we know right well that it cannot\nbut be pleasing and profitable to us to see our enemies, and them that\nseek our lives, die at our feet, or fly before us.  We therefore are\nstill contriving, and that to the best of our cunning, to make this work\nmost facile and easy to your lordships, and to us.\n\n‘First, we considered of that most hellishly cunning, compacted,\nthreefold project, that by you was propounded to us in your last; and\nhave concluded, that though to blow them up with the gunpowder of pride\nwould do well, and to do it by tempting them to be loose and vain will\nhelp on, yet to contrive to bring them into the gulf of desperation, we\nthink will do best of all.  Now we, who are at your beck, have thought or\ntwo ways to do this: first we, for our parts, will make them as vile as\nwe can, and then you with us, at a time appointed, shall be ready to fall\nupon them with the utmost force.  And of all the nations that are at your\nwhistle, we think that an army of doubters may be the most likely to\nattack and overcome the town of Mansoul.  Thus shall we overcome these\nenemies, else the pit shall open her mouth upon them, and desperation\nshall thrust them down into it.  We have also, to effect this so much by\nus desired design, sent already three of our trusty Diabolonians among\nthem; they are disguised in garb, they have changed their names, and are\nnow accepted of them; namely, Covetousness, Lasciviousness, and Anger.\nThe name of Covetousness is changed to Prudent-Thrifty, and him Mr. Mind\nhas hired, and is almost become as bad as our friend.  Lasciviousness has\nchanged his name to Harmless-Mirth, and he is got to be the Lord\nWillbewill’s lackey; but he has made his master very wanton.  Anger\nchanged his name into Good-Zeal, and was entertained by Mr. Godly-Fear;\nbut the peevish old gentleman took pepper in the nose, and turned our\ncompanion out of his house.  Nay, he has informed us since that he ran\naway from him, or else his old master had hanged him up for his labour.\n\n‘Now these have much helped forward our work and design upon Mansoul; for\nnotwithstanding the spite and quarrelsome temper of the old gentleman\nlast mentioned, the other two ply their business well, and are likely to\nripen the work apace.\n\n‘Our next project is, that it be concluded that you come upon the town\nupon a market-day, and that when they are upon the heat of their\nbusiness; for then, to be sure, they will be most secure, and least think\nthat an assault will be made upon them.  They will also at such a time be\nless able to defend themselves, and to offend you in the prosecution of\nour design.  And we your trusty (and we are sure your beloved) ones\nshall, when you shall make your furious assault without, be ready to\nsecond the business within.  So shall we, in all likelihood, be able to\nput Mansoul to utter confusion, and to swallow them up before they can\ncome to themselves.  If your serpentine heads, most subtile dragons, and\nour highly esteemed lords can find out a better way than this, let us\nquickly know your minds.\n\n‘To the monsters of the infernal cave, from the house of Mr. Mischief in\nMansoul, by the hand of Mr. Profane.’\n\nNow all the while that the raging runagates and hellish Diabolonians were\nthus contriving the ruin of the town of Mansoul, they (namely, the poor\ntown itself) was in a sad and woeful case; partly because they had so\ngrievously offended Shaddai and his Son, and partly because that the\nenemies thereby got strength within them afresh; and also because, though\nthey had by many petitions made suit to the Prince Emmanuel, and to his\nFather Shaddai by him, for their pardon and favour, yet hitherto obtained\nthey not one smile; but contrariwise, through the craft and subtilty of\nthe domestic Diabolonians, their cloud was made to grow blacker and\nblacker, and their Emmanuel to stand at further distance.\n\nThe sickness also did still greatly rage in Mansoul, both among the\ncaptains and the inhabitants of the town; and their enemies only were now\nlively and strong, and likely to become the head, whilst Mansoul was made\nthe tail.\n\nBy this time the letter last mentioned, that was written by the\nDiabolonians that yet lurked in the town of Mansoul, was conveyed to\nDiabolus in the black den, by the hand of Mr. Profane.  He carried the\nletter by Hell-Gate Hill as afore, and conveyed it by Cerberus to his\nlord.\n\nBut when Cerberus and Mr. Profane did meet, they were presently as great\nas beggars, and thus they fell into discourse about Mansoul, and about\nthe project against her.\n\n‘Ah! old friend,’ quoth Cerberus, ‘art thou come to Hell-Gate Hill again?\nBy St. Mary, I am glad to see thee!’\n\n_Prof._  Yes, my lord, I am come again about the concerns of the town of\nMansoul.\n\n_Cerb._  Prithee, tell me what condition is that town of Mansoul in at\npresent?\n\n_Prof._  In a brave condition, my lord, for us, and for my lords, the\nlords of this place, I trow for they are greatly decayed as to godliness,\nand that is as well as our heart can wish; their Lord is greatly out with\nthem, and that doth also please us well.  We have already also a foot in\ntheir dish, for our Diabolonian friends are laid in their bosoms, and\nwhat do we lack but to be masters of the place!  Besides, our trusty\nfriends in Mansoul are daily plotting to betray it to the lords of this\ntown; also the sickness rages bitterly among them; and that which makes\nup all, we hope at last to prevail.’\n\nThen said the dog of Hell-Gate, ‘No time like this to assault them.  I\nwish that the enterprise be followed close, and that the success desired\nmay be soon effected: yea, I wish it for the poor Diabolonians’ sakes,\nthat live in the continual fear of their lives in that traitorous town of\nMansoul.’\n\n_Prof._  The contrivance is almost finished, the lords in Mansoul that\nare Diabolonians are at it day and night, and the other are like silly\ndoves; they want heart to be concerned with their state and to consider\nthat ruin is at hand.  Besides you may, yea, must think, when you put all\nthings together, that there are many reasons that prevail with Diabolus\nto make what haste he can.\n\n_Cerb._  Thou hast said as it is; I am glad things are at this pass.  Go\nin, my brave Profane, to my lords, they will give thee for thy welcome as\ngood a _coranto_ as the whole of this kingdom will afford.  I have sent\nthy letter in already.\n\nThen Mr. Profane went into the den, and his lord Diabolus met him, and\nsaluted him with, ‘Welcome, my trusty servant: I have been made glad with\nthy letter.’  The rest of the lords of the pit gave him also their\nsalutations.  Then Profane, after obeisance made to them all, said, ‘Let\nMansoul be given to my lord Diabolus, and let him be her king for ever.’\nAnd with that, the hollow belly and yawning gorge of hell gave so loud\nand hideous a groan, (for that is the music of that place,) that it made\nthe mountains about it totter, as if they would fall in pieces.\n\nNow, after they had read and considered the letter, they consulted what\nanswer to return; and the first that did speak to it was Lucifer.\n\nThen said he, ‘The first project of the Diabolonians in Mansoul is likely\nto be lucky, and to take; namely, that they will, by all the ways and\nmeans they can, make Mansoul yet more vile and filthy: no way to destroy\na soul like this.  Our old friend Balaam went this way and prospered many\nyears ago; let this therefore stand with us for a maxim, and be to\nDiabolonians for a general rule in all ages; for nothing can make this to\nfail but grace, in which I would hope that this town has no share.  But\nwhether to fall upon them on a market-day, because of their cumber in\nbusiness, that I would should be under debate.  And there is more reason\nwhy this head should be debated, than why some other should; because upon\nthis will turn the whole of what we shall attempt.  If we time not our\nbusiness well, our whole project may fail.  Our friends, the\nDiabolonians, say that a market-day is best; for then will Mansoul be\nmost busy, and have fewest thoughts of a surprise.  But what if also they\nshould double their guards on those days? (and methinks nature and reason\nshould teach them to do it;) and what if they should keep such a watch on\nthose days as the necessity of their present case doth require? yea, what\nif their men should be always in arms on those days? then you may, my\nlords, be disappointed in your attempts, and may bring our friends in the\ntown to utter danger of unavoidable ruin.’\n\nThen said the great Beelzebub, ‘There is something in what my lord hath\nsaid; but his conjecture may, or may not fall out.  Nor hath my lord laid\nit down as that which must not be receded from; for I know that he said\nit only to provoke to a warm debate thereabout.  Therefore we must\nunderstand, if we can, whether the town of Mansoul has such sense and\nknowledge of her decayed state, and of the design that we have on foot\nagainst her, as doth provoke her to set watch and ward at her gates, and\nto double them on market-days.  But if, after inquiry made, it shall be\nfound that they are asleep, then any day will do, but a market-day is\nbest; and this is my judgment in this case.’\n\nThen quoth Diabolus, ‘How should we know this?’ and it was answered,\n‘Inquire about it at the mouth of Mr. Profane.’  So Profane was called\nin, and asked the question, and he made his answer as follows:—\n\n_Prof._  My lords, so far as I can gather, this is at present the\ncondition of the town of Mansoul: they are decayed in their faith and\nlove; Emmanuel, their Prince, has given them the back; they send often by\npetition to fetch him again, but he maketh not haste to answer their\nrequest, nor is there much reformation among them.\n\n_Diab._  I am glad that they are backward in a reformation, but yet I am\nafraid of their petitioning.  However, their looseness of life is a sign\nthat there is not much heart in what they do, and without the heart\nthings are little worth.  But go on, my masters; I will divert you, my\nlords, no longer.\n\n_Beel._  If the case be so with Mansoul, as Mr. Profane has described it\nto be, it will be no great matter what day we assault it; not their\nprayers, nor their power will do them much service.\n\nWhen Beelzebub had ended his oration, then Apollyon did begin.  ‘My\nopinion,’ said he, ‘concerning this matter, is, that we go on fair and\nsoftly, not doing things in a hurry.  Let our friends in Mansoul go on\nstill to pollute and defile it, by seeking to draw it yet more into sin\n(for there is nothing like sin to devour Mansoul).  If this be done, and\nit takes effect, Mansoul, of itself, will leave off to watch, to\npetition, or anything else that should tend to her security and safety;\nfor she will forget her Emmanuel, she will not desire his company, and\ncan she be gotten thus to live, her Prince will not come to her in haste.\nOur trusty friend, Mr. Carnal-Security, with one of his tricks did drive\nhim out of the town; and why may not my Lord Covetousness, and my Lord\nLasciviousness, by what they may do, keep him out of the town?  And this\nI will tell you, (not because you know it not,) that two or three\nDiabolonians, if entertained and countenanced by the town of Mansoul,\nwill do more to the keeping of Emmanuel from them, and towards making the\ntown of Mansoul your own, than can an army of a legion that should be\nsent out from us to withstand him.  Let, therefore, this first project\nthat our friends in Mansoul have set on foot, be strongly and diligently\ncarried on, with all cunning and craft imaginable; and let them send\ncontinually, under one guise or another, more and other of their men to\nplay with the people of Mansoul; and then, perhaps, we shall not need to\nbe at the charge of making a war upon them; or if that must of necessity\nbe done, yet the more sinful they are, the more unable, to be sure, they\nwill be to resist us, and then the more easily we shall overcome them.\nAnd besides, suppose (and that is the worst that can be supposed) that\nEmmanuel should come to them again, why may not the same means, or the\nlike, drive him from them once more?  Yea, why may he not, by their lapse\ninto that sin again, be driven from them for ever, for the sake of which\nhe was at the first driven from them for a season?  And if this should\nhappen, then away go with him his rams, his slings, his captains, his\nsoldiers, and he leaveth Mansoul naked and bare.  Yea, will not this\ntown, when she sees herself utterly forsaken of her Prince, of her own\naccord open her gates again unto you, and make of you as in the days of\nold?  But this must be done by time, a few days will not effect so great\na work as this.’\n\nSo soon as Apollyon had made an end of speaking, Diabolus began to blow\nout his own malice, and to plead his own cause; and he said, ‘My lords,\nand powers of the cave, my true and trusty friends, I have with much\nimpatience, as becomes me, given ear to your long and tedious orations.\nBut my furious gorge, and empty paunch, so lusteth after a repossession\nof my famous town of Mansoul, that whatever comes out, I can wait no\nlonger to see the events of lingering projects.  I must, and that without\nfurther delay, seek, by all means I can, to fill my insatiable gulf with\nthe soul and body of the town of Mansoul.  Therefore lend me your heads,\nyour hearts, and your help, now I am going to recover my town of\nMansoul.’\n\nWhen the lords and princes of the pit saw the flaming desire that was in\nDiabolus to devour the miserable town of Mansoul, they left off to raise\nany more objections, but consented to lend him what strength they could,\nthough had Apollyon’s advice been taken, they had far more fearfully\ndistressed the town of Mansoul.  But, I say, they were willing to lend\nhim what strength they could, not knowing what need they might have of\nhim, when they should engage for themselves, as he.  Wherefore they fell\nto advising about the next thing propounded, namely, what soldiers they\nwere, and also how many, with whom Diabolus should go against the town of\nMansoul to take it; and after some debate, it was concluded, according as\nin the letter the Diabolonians had suggested, that none were more fit for\nthat expedition than an army of terrible doubters.  They therefore\nconcluded to send against Mansoul an army of sturdy doubters.  The number\nthought fit to be employed in that service was between twenty and thirty\nthousand.  So then the result of that great council of those high and\nmighty lords was—That Diabolus should even now, out of hand, beat up his\ndrum for men in the land of Doubting, which land lieth upon the confines\nof the place called Hell-Gate Hill, for men that might be employed by him\nagainst the miserable town of Mansoul.  It was also concluded, that these\nlords themselves should help him in the war, and that they would to that\nend head and manage his men.  So they drew up a letter, and sent back to\nthe Diabolonians that lurked in Mansoul, and that waited for the\nback-coming of Mr. Profane, to signify to them into what method and\nforwardness they at present had put their design.  The contents whereof\nnow follow:—\n\n‘From the dark and horrible dungeon of hell, Diabolus with all the\nsociety of the princes of darkness, sends to our trusty ones, in and\nabout the walls of the town of Mansoul, now impatiently waiting for our\nmost devilish answer to their venomous and most poisonous design against\nthe town of Mansoul.\n\n‘Our native ones, in whom from day to day we boast, and in whose actions\nall the year long we do greatly delight ourselves, we received your\nwelcome, because highly esteemed letter, at the hand of our trusty and\ngreatly beloved, the old gentleman, Mr. Profane.  And do give you to\nunderstand, that when we had broken it up, and had read the contents\nthereof, to your amazing memory be it spoken, our yawning hollow-bellied\nplace, where we are, made so hideous and yelling a noise for joy, that\nthe mountains that stand round about Hell-Gate Hill, had like to have\nbeen shaken to pieces at the sound thereof.\n\n‘We could also do no less than admire your faithfulness to us, with the\ngreatness of that subtilty that now hath showed itself to be in your\nheads to serve us against the town of Mansoul.  For you have invented for\nus so excellent a method for our proceeding against that rebellious\npeople, a more effectual cannot be thought of by all the wits of hell.\nThe proposals, therefore, which now, at last, you have sent us, since we\nsaw them, we have done little else but highly approved and admired them.\n\n‘Nay, we shall, to encourage you in the profundity of your craft, let you\nknow, that, at a full assembly and conclave of our princes and\nprincipalities of this place, your project was discoursed and tossed from\none side of our cave to the other by their mightinesses; but a better,\nand as was by themselves judged, a more fit and proper way by all their\nwits, could not be invented, to surprise, take, and make our own, the\nrebellious town of Mansoul.\n\n‘Wherefore, in fine, all that was said that varied from what you had in\nyour letter propounded, fell of itself to the ground, and yours only was\nstuck to by Diabolus, the prince; yea, his gaping gorge and yawning\npaunch was on fire to put your invention into execution.\n\n‘We therefore give you to understand that our stout, furious, and\nunmerciful Diabolus is raising, for your relief, and the ruin of the\nrebellious town of Mansoul, more than twenty thousand doubters to come\nagainst that people.  They are all stout and sturdy men, and men that of\nold have been accustomed to war, and that can therefore well endure the\ndrum.  I say, he is doing this work of his with all the possible speed he\ncan; for his heart and spirit is engaged in it.  We desire, therefore,\nthat, as you have hitherto stuck to us, and given us both advice and\nencouragement thus far, you still will prosecute our design; nor shall\nyou lose, but be gainers thereby; yea, we intend to make you the lords of\nMansoul.\n\n‘One thing may not by any means be omitted, that is, those with us do\ndesire that every one of you that are in Mansoul would still use all your\npower, cunning, and skill, with delusive persuasions, yet to draw the\ntown of Mansoul into more sin and wickedness, even that sin may be\nfinished and bring forth death.\n\n‘For thus it is concluded with us, that the more vile, sinful, and\ndebauched the town of Mansoul is, more backward will be their Emmanuel to\ncome to their help, either by presence or other relief; yea, the more\nsinful, the more weak, and so the more unable will they be to make\nresistance when we shall make our assault upon them to swallow them up.\nYea, that may cause that their mighty Shaddai himself may cast them out\nof his protection; yea, and send for his captains and soldiers home, with\nhis slings and rams, and leave them naked and bare; and then the town of\nMansoul will of itself open to us, and fall as the fig into the mouth of\nthe eater.  Yea, to be sure that we then with a great deal of ease shall\ncome upon her and overcome her.\n\n‘As to the time of our coming upon Mansoul, we, as yet, have not fully\nresolved upon that, though at present some of us think as you, that a\nmarket-day, or a market-day at night, will certainly be the best.\nHowever, do you be ready, and when you shall hear our roaring drum\nwithout, do you be as busy to make the most horrible confusion within.\nSo shall Mansoul certainly be distressed before and behind, and shall not\nknow which way to betake herself for help.  My Lord Lucifer, my Lord\nBeelzebub, my Lord Apollyon, my Lord Legion, with the rest, salute you,\nas does also my Lord Diabolus; and we wish both you, with all that you\ndo, or shall possess, the very self-same fruit and success for their\ndoing as we ourselves at present enjoy for ours.\n\n‘From our dreadful confines in the most fearful pit, we salute you, and\nso do those many legions here with us, wishing you may be as hellishly\nprosperous as we desire to be ourselves.  By the letter-carrier, Mr.\nProfane.’\n\nThen Mr. Profane addressed himself for his return to Mansoul, with his\nerrand from the horrible pit to the Diabolonians that dwelt in that town.\nSo he came up the stairs from the deep to the mouth of the cave where\nCerberus was.  Now when Cerberus saw him, he asked how did matters go\nbelow, about and against the town of Mansoul.\n\n_Prof._  Things go as well as we can expect.  The letter that I carried\nthither was highly approved, and well liked by all my lords, and I am\nreturning to tell our Diabolonians so.  I have an answer to it here in my\nbosom, that I am sure will make our masters that sent me glad; for the\ncontents thereof are to encourage them to pursue their design to the\nutmost, and to be ready also to fall on within, when they shall see my\nLord Diabolus beleaguering the town of Mansoul.\n\n_Cerb._  But does he intend to go against them himself?\n\n_Prof._  Does he!  Ay! and he will take along with him more than twenty\nthousand, all sturdy Doubters, and men of war, picked men from the land\nof Doubting, to serve him in the expedition.\n\nThen was Cerberus glad, and said, ‘And is there such brave preparations\na-making to go against the miserable town of Mansoul?  And would I might\nbe put at the head of a thousand of them, that I might also show my\nvalour against the famous town of Mansoul.’\n\n_Prof._  Your wish may come to pass; you look like one that has mettle\nenough, and my lord will have with him those that are valiant and stout.\nBut my business requires haste.\n\n_Cerb._  Ay, so it does.  Speed thee to the town of Mansoul, with all the\ndeepest mischiefs that this place can afford thee.  And when thou shalt\ncome to the house of Mr. Mischief, the place where the Diabolonians meet\nto plot, tell them that Cerberus doth wish them his service, and that if\nhe may, he will with the army come up against the famous town of Mansoul.\n\n_Prof._  That I will.  And I know that my lords that are there will be\nglad to hear it, and to see you also.\n\nSo after a few more such kind of compliments, Mr. Profane took his leave\nof his friend Cerberus; and Cerberus again, with a thousand of their\npit-wishes, bid him haste, with all speed, to his masters.  The which\nwhen he had heard, he made obeisance, and began to gather up his heels to\nrun.\n\nThus, therefore, he returned, and went and came to Mansoul; and going, as\nafore, to the house of Mr. Mischief, there he found the Diabolonians\nassembled, and waiting for his return.  Now when he was come, and had\npresented himself, he also delivered to them his letter, and adjoined\nthis compliment to them therewith: ‘My lords, from the confines of the\npit, the high and mighty principalities and powers of the den salute you\nhere, the true Diabolonians of the town of Mansoul.  Wishing you always\nthe most proper of their benedictions, for the great service, high\nattempts, and brave achievements that you have put yourselves upon, for\nthe restoring to our prince Diabolus the famous town of Mansoul.’\n\nThis was therefore the present state of the miserable town of Mansoul:\nshe had offended her Prince, and he was gone; she had encouraged the\npowers of hell, by her foolishness, to come against her to seek her utter\ndestruction.\n\nTrue, the town of Mansoul was somewhat made sensible of her sin, but the\nDiabolonians were gotten into her bowels; she cried, but Emmanuel was\ngone, and her cries did not fetch him as yet again.  Besides, she knew\nnot now whether, ever or never, he would return and come to his Mansoul\nagain; nor did they know the power and industry of the enemy, nor how\nforward they were to put in execution that plot of hell that they had\ndevised against her.\n\nThey did, indeed, still send petition after petition to the Prince, but\nhe answered all with silence.  They did neglect reformation, and that was\nas Diabolus would have it; for he knew, if they regarded iniquity in\ntheir heart, their King would not hear their prayer; they therefore did\nstill grow weaker and weaker, and were as a rolling thing before the\nwhirlwind.  They cried to their King for help, and laid Diabolonians in\ntheir bosoms: what therefore should a King do to them?  Yea, there seemed\nnow to be a mixture in Mansoul; the Diabolonians and the Mansoulians\nwould walk the streets together.  Yea, they began to seek their peace;\nfor they thought that, since the sickness had been so mortal in Mansoul,\nit was in vain to go to handygripes with them.  Besides, the weakness of\nMansoul was the strength of their enemies; and the sins of Mansoul, the\nadvantage of the Diabolonians.  The foes of Mansoul did also now begin to\npromise themselves the town for a possession: there was no great\ndifference now betwixt Mansoulians and Diabolonians: both seemed to be\nmasters of Mansoul.  Yea, the Diabolonians increased and grew, but the\ntown of Mansoul diminished greatly.  There were more than eleven thousand\nmen, women, and children that died by the sickness in Mansoul.\n\nBut now, as Shaddai would have it, there was one whose name was Mr.\nPrywell, a great lover of the people of Mansoul.  And he, as his manner\nwas, did go listening up and down in Mansoul to see, and to hear, if at\nany time he might, whether there was any design against it or no.  For he\nwas always a jealous man, and feared some mischief sometime would befal\nit, either from the Diabolonians within, or from some power without.  Now\nupon a time it so happened, as Mr. Prywell went listening here and there,\nthat he lighted upon a place called Vilehill, in Mansoul, where\nDiabolonians used to meet; so hearing a muttering, (you must know that it\nwas in the night,) he softly drew near to hear; nor had he stood long\nunder the house-end, (for there stood a house there,) but he heard one\nconfidently affirm, that it was not, or would not be long before Diabolus\nshould possess himself again of Mansoul; and that then the Diabolonians\ndid intend to put all Mansoulians to the sword, and would kill and\ndestroy the King’s captains, and drive all his soldiers out of the town.\nHe said, moreover, that he knew there were above twenty thousand fighting\nmen prepared by Diabolus for the accomplishing of this design, and that\nit would not be months before they all should see it.\n\nWhen Mr. Prywell had heard this story, he did quickly believe it was\ntrue: wherefore he went forthwith to my Lord Mayor’s house, and\nacquainted him therewith; who, sending for the subordinate preacher,\nbrake the business to him; and he as soon gave the alarm to the town; for\nhe was now the chief preacher in Mansoul, because, as yet, my Lord\nSecretary was ill at ease.  And this was the way that the subordinate\npreacher did take to alarm the town therewith.  The same hour he caused\nthe lecture bell to be rung; so the people came together: he gave them\nthen a short exhortation to watchfulness, and made Mr. Prywell’s news the\nargument thereof.  ‘For,’ said he, ‘an horrible plot is contrived against\nMansoul, even to massacre us all in a day, nor is this story to be\nslighted; for Mr. Prywell is the author thereof.  Mr. Prywell was always\na lover of Mansoul, a sober and judicious man, a man that is no tattler,\nnor raiser of false reports, but one that loves to look into the very\nbottom of matters, and talks nothing of news, but by very solid\narguments.\n\n‘I will call him, and you shall hear him your own selves;’ so he called\nhim, and he came and told his tale so punctually, and affirmed its truth\nwith such ample grounds, that Mansoul fell presently under a conviction\nof the truth of what he said.  The preacher did also back him, saying,\n‘Sirs, it is not irrational for us to believe it, for we have provoked\nShaddai to anger, and have sinned Emmanuel out of the town; we have had\ntoo much correspondence with Diabolonians, and have forsaken our former\nmercies: no marvel then, if the enemy both within and without should\ndesign and plot our ruin; and what time like this to do it?  The sickness\nis now in the town, and we have been made weak thereby.  Many a good\nmeaning man is dead, and the Diabolonians of late grow stronger and\nstronger.\n\n‘Besides,’ quoth the subordinate preacher, ‘I have received from this\ngood truth-teller this one inkling further, that he understood by those\nthat he overheard, that several letters have lately passed between the\nfuries and the Diabolonians in order to our destruction.’  When Mansoul\nheard all this, and not being able to gainsay it, they lift up their\nvoice and wept.  Mr. Prywell did also, in the presence of the townsmen,\nconfirm all that their subordinate preacher had said.  Wherefore they now\nset afresh to bewail their folly, and to a doubling of petitions to\nShaddai and his Son.  They also brake the business to the captains, high\ncommanders, and men of war in the town of Mansoul, entreating them to use\nthe means to be strong, and to take good courage; and that they would\nlook after their harness, and make themselves ready to give Diabolus\nbattle by night and by day, shall he come, as they are informed he will,\nto beleaguer the town of Mansoul.\n\nWhen the captains heard this, they being always true lovers of the town\nof Mansoul, what do they but like so many Samsons they shake themselves,\nand come together to consult and contrive how to defeat those bold and\nhellish contrivances that were upon the wheel by the means of Diabolus\nand his friends against the now sickly, weakly, and much impoverished\ntown of Mansoul; and they agreed upon these following particulars:—\n\n1. That the gates of Mansoul should be kept shut, and made fast with bars\nand locks, and that all persons that went out, or came in, should be very\nstrictly examined by the captains of the guards, ‘to the end,’ said they,\n‘that those that are managers of the plot amongst us, may, either coming\nor going, be taken; and that we may also find out who are the great\ncontrivers, amongst us, of our ruin.’\n\n2. The next thing was, that a strict search should be made for all kind\nof Diabolonians throughout the whole town of Mansoul; and that every\nman’s house from top to bottom should be looked into, and that, too,\nhouse by house, that if possible a further discovery might be made of all\nsuch among them as had a hand in these designs.\n\n3. It was further concluded upon, that wheresoever or with whomsoever any\nof the Diabolonians were found, that even those of the town of Mansoul\nthat had given them house and harbour, should to their shame, and the\nwarning of others, take penance in the open place.\n\n4. It was, moreover, resolved by the famous town of Mansoul, that a\npublic fast, and a day of humiliation, should be kept throughout the\nwhole corporation, to the justifying of their Prince, the abasing of\nthemselves before him for their transgressions against him, and against\nShaddai, his Father.  It was further resolved, that all such in Mansoul\nas did not on that day endeavour to keep that fast, and to humble\nthemselves for their faults, but that should mind their worldly employs,\nor be found wandering up and down the streets, should be taken for\nDiabolonians, and should suffer as Diabolonians for such their wicked\ndoings.\n\n5. It was further concluded then, that with what speed, and with what\nwarmth of mind they could, they would renew their humiliation for sin,\nand their petitions to Shaddai for help; they also resolved, to send\ntidings to the court of all that Mr. Prywell had told them.\n\n6. It was also determined, that thanks should be given by the town of\nMansoul to Mr. Prywell, for his diligent seeking of the welfare of their\ntown: and further, that forasmuch as he was so naturally inclined to seek\ntheir good, and also to undermine their foes, they gave him a commission\nof scout-master-general, for the good of the town of Mansoul.\n\nWhen the corporation, with their captains, had thus concluded, they did\nas they had said; they shut up their gates, they made for Diabolonians\nstrict search, they made those with whom any were found to take penance\nin the open place: they kept their fast, and renewed their petitions to\ntheir Prince, and Mr. Prywell managed his charge and the trust that\nMansoul had put in his hands, with great conscience and good fidelity;\nfor he gave himself wholly up to his employ, and that not only within the\ntown, but he went out to pry, to see, and to hear.\n\nAnd not many days after he provided for his journey, and went towards\nHell-Gate Hill, into the country where the Doubters were, where he heard\nof all that had been talked of in Mansoul, and he perceived also that\nDiabolus was almost ready for his march, etc.  So he came back with\nspeed, and, calling the captains and elders of Mansoul together, he told\nthem where he had been, what he had heard, and what he had seen.\nParticularly, he told them that Diabolus was almost ready for his march,\nand that he had made old Mr. Incredulity, that once brake prison in\nMansoul, the general of his army; that his army consisted all of\nDoubters, and that their number was above twenty thousand.  He told,\nmoreover, that Diabolus did intend to bring with him the chief princes of\nthe infernal pit, and that he would make them chief captains over his\nDoubters.  He told them, moreover, that it was certainly true that\nseveral of the black den would, with Diabolus, ride reformades to reduce\nthe town of Mansoul to the obedience of Diabolus, their prince.\n\nHe said, moreover, that he understood by the Doubters, among whom he had\nbeen, that the reason why old Incredulity was made general of the whole\narmy, was because none truer than he to the tyrant; and because he had an\nimplacable spite against the welfare of the town of Mansoul.  Besides,\nsaid he, he remembers the affronts that Mansoul has given him, and he is\nresolved to be revenged of them.\n\nBut the black princes shall be made high commanders, only Incredulity\nshall be over them all; because, which I had almost forgot, he can more\neasily, and more dexterously, beleaguer the town of Mansoul, than can any\nof the princes besides.\n\nNow, when the captains of Mansoul, with the elders of the town, had heard\nthe tidings that Mr. Prywell did bring, they thought it expedient,\nwithout further delay, to put into execution the laws that against the\nDiabolonians their Prince had made for them, and given them in\ncommandment to manage against them.  Wherefore, forthwith a diligent and\nimpartial search was made in all houses in Mansoul, for all and all\nmanner of Diabolonians.  Now, in the house of Mr. Mind, and in the house\nof the great Lord Willbewill, were two Diabolonians found.  In Mr. Mind’s\nhouse was one Lord Covetousness found; but he had changed his name to\nPrudent-Thrifty.  In my Lord Willbewill’s house, one Lasciviousness was\nfound; but he had changed his name to Harmless-Mirth.  These two the\ncaptains and elders of the town of Mansoul took, and committed them to\ncustody under the hand of Mr. Trueman, the gaoler; and this man handled\nthem so severely, and loaded them so well with irons, that in time they\nboth fell into a very deep consumption, and died in the prison-house;\ntheir masters also, according to the agreement of the captains and\nelders, were brought to take penance in the open place to their shame,\nand for a warning to the rest of the town of Mansoul.\n\nNow, this was the manner of penance in those days: the persons offending\nbeing made sensible of the evil of their doings, were enjoined open\nconfession of their faults, and a strict amendment of their lives.\n\nAfter this, the captains and elders of Mansoul sought yet to find out\nmore Diabolonians, wherever they lurked, whether in dens, caves, holes,\nvaults, or where else they could, in or about the wall or town of\nMansoul.  But though they could plainly see their footing, and so follow\nthem by their track and smell to their holds, even to the mouths of their\ncaves and dens, yet take them, hold them, and do justice upon them, they\ncould not; their ways were so crooked, their holds so strong, and they so\nquick to take sanctuary there.\n\nBut Mansoul did now with so stiff an hand rule over the Diabolonians that\nwere left, that they were glad to shrink into corners: time was when they\ndurst walk openly, and in the day; but now they were forced to embrace\nprivacy and the night: time was when a Mansoulian was their companion;\nbut now they counted them deadly enemies.  This good change did Mr.\nPrywell’s intelligence make in the famous town of Mansoul.\n\nBy this time, Diabolus had finished his army which he intended to bring\nwith him for the ruin of Mansoul; and had set over them captains, and\nother field officers, such as liked his furious stomach best: himself was\nlord paramount, Incredulity was general of his army, their highest\ncaptains shall be named afterwards; but now for their officers, colours,\nand scutcheons.\n\n1. Their first captain was Captain Rage: he was captain over the election\ndoubters, his were the red colours; his standard-bearer was Mr.\nDestructive, and the great red dragon he had for his scutcheon.\n\n2. The second captain was Captain Fury: he was captain over the vocation\ndoubters; his standard-bearer was Mr. Darkness, his colours were those\nthat were pale, and he had for his scutcheon the fiery flying serpent.\n\n3. The third captain was Captain Damnation: he was captain over the grace\ndoubters; his were the red colours, Mr. No-Life bare them, and he had for\nhis scutcheon the black den.\n\n4. The fourth captain was Captain Insatiable; he was captain over the\nfaith doubters: his were the red colours, Mr. Devourer bare them, and he\nhad for a scutcheon the yawning jaws.\n\n5. The fifth captain was Captain Brimstone: he was captain over the\nperseverance doubters; his also were the red colours, Mr. Burning bare\nthem, and his scutcheon was the blue and stinking flame.\n\n6. The sixth captain was Captain Torment: he was captain over the\nresurrection doubters; his colours were those that were pale; Mr. Gnaw\nwas his standard-bearer, and he had the black worm for his scutcheon.\n\n7. The seventh captain was Captain No-Ease; he was captain over the\nsalvation doubters; his were the red colours, Mr. Restless bare them, and\nhis scutcheon was the ghastly picture of death.\n\n8. The eighth captain was the Captain Sepulchre: he was captain over the\nglory doubters; his also were the pale colours, Mr. Corruption was his\nstandard-bearer, and he had for his scutcheon a skull, and dead men’s\nbones.\n\n9. The ninth captain was Captain Past-Hope; he was captain of those that\nare called the felicity doubters; his standard-bearer was Mr. Despair;\nhis also were the red colours, and his scutcheon was a hot iron and the\nhard heart.\n\nThese were his captains, and these were their forces, these were their\nstandards, these were their colours, and these were their scutcheons.\nNow, over these did the great Diabolus make superior captains, and they\nwere in number seven: as, namely, the Lord Beelzebub, the Lord Lucifer,\nthe Lord Legion, the Lord Apollyon, the Lord Python, the Lord Cerberus,\nand the Lord Belial; these seven he set over the captains, and\nIncredulity was lord-general, and, Diabolus was king.  The reformades\nalso, such as were like themselves, were made some of them captains of\nhundreds, and some of them captains of more.  And thus was the army of\nIncredulity completed.\n\nSo they set out at Hell-Gate Hill, for there they had their rendezvous,\nfrom whence they came with a straight course upon their march toward the\ntown of Mansoul.  Now, as was hinted before, the town had, as Shaddai\nwould have it, received from the mouth of Mr. Prywell the alarm of their\ncoming before.  Wherefore they set a strong watch at the gates, and had\nalso doubled their guards: they also mounted their slings in good places,\nwhere they might conveniently cast out their great stones to the\nannoyance of their furious enemy.\n\nNor could those Diabolonians that were in the town do that hurt as was\ndesigned they should; for Mansoul was now awake.  But alas! poor people,\nthey were sorely affrighted at the first appearance of their foes, and at\ntheir sitting down before the town, especially when they heard the\nroaring of their drum.  This, to speak truth, was amazingly hideous to\nhear; it frighted all men seven miles round, if they were but awake and\nheard it.  The streaming of their colours was also terrible and dejecting\nto behold.\n\nWhen Diabolus was come up against the town, first he made his approach to\nEar-gate, and gave it a furious assault, supposing, as it seems, that his\nfriends in Mansoul had been ready to do the work within; but care was\ntaken of that before, by the vigilance of the captains.  Wherefore,\nmissing of the help that he expected from them, and finding his army\nwarmly attended with the stones that the slingers did sling, (for that I\nwill say for the captains, that considering the weakness that yet was\nupon them by reason of the long sickness that had annoyed the town of\nMansoul, they did gallantly behave themselves,) he was forced to make\nsome retreat from Mansoul, and to entrench himself and his men in the\nfield without the reach of the slings of the town.\n\nNow having entrenched himself, he did cast up four mounts against the\ntown: the first he called Mount Diabolus, putting his own name thereon,\nthe more to affright the town of Mansoul; the other three he called\nthus—Mount Alecto, Mount Megara, and Mount Tisiphone; for these are the\nnames of the dreadful furies of hell.  Thus he began to play his game\nwith Mansoul, and to serve it as doth the lion his prey, even to make it\nfall before his terror.  But, as I said, the captains and soldiers\nresisted so stoutly, and did do such execution with their stones, that\nthey made him, though against stomach, to retreat, wherefore Mansoul\nbegan to take courage.\n\nNow upon Mount Diabolus, which was raised on the north side of the town,\nthere did the tyrant set up his standard, and a fearful thing it was to\nbehold; for he had wrought in it by devilish art, after the manner of a\nscutcheon, a flaming flame fearful to behold, and the picture of Mansoul\nburning in it.\n\nWhen Diabolus had thus done, he commanded that his drummer should every\nnight approach the walls of the town of Mansoul, and so to beat a parley;\nthe command was to do it at nights, for in the daytime they annoyed him\nwith their slings; for the tyrant said, that he had a mind to parley with\nthe now trembling town of Mansoul, and he commanded that the drums should\nbeat every night, that through weariness they might at last, if possible,\n(at the first they were unwilling yet,) be forced to do it.\n\nSo this drummer did as commanded: he arose, and did beat his drum.  But\nwhen his drum did go, if one looked toward the town of Mansoul, ‘Behold\ndarkness and sorrow, and the light was darkened in the heaven thereof.’\nNo noise was ever heard upon earth more terrible, except the voice of\nShaddai when he speaketh.  But how did Mansoul tremble! it now looked for\nnothing but forthwith to be swallowed up.\n\nWhen this drummer had beaten for a parley, he made this speech to\nMansoul: ‘My master has bid me tell you, that if you will willingly\nsubmit, you shall have the good of the earth; but if you shall be\nstubborn, he is resolved to take you by force.’  But by that the fugitive\nhad done beating his drum, the people of Mansoul had betaken themselves\nto the captains that were in the castle, so that there was none to\nregard, nor to give this drummer an answer; so he proceeded no further\nthat night, but returned again to his master to the camp.\n\nWhen Diabolus saw that by drumming he could not work out Mansoul to his\nwill, the next night he sendeth his drummer without his drum, still to\nlet the townsmen know that he had a mind to parley with them.  But when\nall came to all, his parley was turned into a summons to the town to\ndeliver up themselves: but they gave him neither heed nor hearing: for\nthey remembered what at first it cost them to hear him a few words.\n\nThe next night he sends again, and then who should be his messenger to\nMansoul but the terrible Captain Sepulchre; so Captain Sepulchre came up\nto the walls of Mansoul, and made this oration to the town:—\n\n‘O ye inhabitants of the rebellious town of Mansoul!  I summon you in the\nname of the Prince Diabolus, that, without any more ado, you set open the\ngates of your town, and admit the great lord to come in.  But if you\nshall still rebel, when we have taken to us the town by force, we will\nswallow you up as the grave; wherefore if you will hearken to my summons,\nsay so, and if not then let me know.\n\n‘The reason of this my summons,’ quoth he, ‘is, for that my lord is your\nundoubted prince and lord, as you yourselves have formerly owned.  Nor\nshall that assault that was given to my lord, when Emmanuel dealt so\ndishonourably by him, prevail with him to lose his right, and to forbear\nto attempt to recover his own.  Consider, then, O Mansoul, with thyself,\nwilt thou show thyself peaceable, or no?  If thou shalt quietly yield up\nthyself, then our old friendship shall be renewed; but if thou shalt yet\nrefuse and rebel, then expect nothing but fire and sword.’\n\nWhen the languishing town of Mansoul had heard this summoner and his\nsummons, they were yet more put to their dumps, but made to the captain\nno answer at all; so away he went as he came.\n\nBut, after some consultation among themselves, as also with some of their\ncaptains, they applied themselves afresh to the Lord Secretary for\ncounsel and advice from him; for this Lord Secretary was their chief\npreacher, (as also is mentioned some pages before,) only now he was ill\nat ease; and of him they begged favour in these two or three things—\n\n1. That he would look comfortably upon them, and not keep himself so much\nretired from them as formerly.  Also, that he would be prevailed with to\ngive them a hearing, while they should make known their miserable\ncondition to him.  But to this he told them as before, that ‘as yet he\nwas but ill at ease, and therefore could not do as he had formerly done.’\n\n2. The second thing that they desired was, that he would be pleased to\ngive them his advice about their now so important affairs, for that\nDiabolus was come and set down before the town with no less than twenty\nthousand doubters.  They said, moreover, that both he and his captains\nwere cruel men, and that they were afraid of them.  But to this he said,\n‘You must look to the law of the Prince, and there see what is laid upon\nyou to do.’\n\n3. Then they desired that his highness would help them to frame a\npetition to Shaddai, and unto Emmanuel his Son, and that he would set his\nown hand thereto as a token that he was one with them in it: ‘For,’ said\nthey, ‘my Lord, many a one have we sent, but can get no answer of peace;\nbut now, surely, one with thy hand unto it may obtain good for Mansoul.’\n\nBut all the answer that he gave to this was, ‘that they had offended\ntheir Emmanuel, and had also grieved himself, and that therefore they\nmust as yet partake of their own devices.’\n\nThis answer of the Lord Secretary fell like a millstone upon them; yea,\nit crushed them so that they could not tell what to do; yet they durst\nnot comply with the demands of Diabolus, nor with the demands of his\ncaptain.  So then here were the straits that the town of Mansoul was\nbetwixt, when the enemy came upon her: her foes were ready to swallow her\nup, and her friends did forbear to help her.\n\nThen stood up my Lord Mayor, whose name was my Lord Understanding, and he\nbegan to pick and pick, until he had picked comfort out of that seemingly\nbitter saying of the Lord Secretary; for thus he descanted upon it:\n‘First,’ said he, ‘this unavoidably follows upon the saying of my Lord,\n“that we must yet suffer for our sins.”  Secondly, But,’ quoth he, ‘the\nwords yet sound as if at last we should be saved from our enemies, and\nthat after a few more sorrows, Emmanuel will come and be our help.’  Now\nthe Lord Mayor was the more critical in his dealing with the Secretary’s\nwords, because my lord was more than a prophet, and because none of his\nwords were such, but that at all times they were most exactly\nsignificant; and the townsmen were allowed to pry into them, and to\nexpound them to their best advantage.\n\nSo they took their leaves of my lord, and returned, and went, and came to\nthe captains, to whom they did tell what my Lord High Secretary had said;\nwho, when they had heard it, were all of the same opinion as was my Lord\nMayor himself.  The captains, therefore, began to take some courage unto\nthem, and to prepare to make some brave attempt upon the camp of the\nenemy, and to destroy all that were Diabolonians, with the roving\ndoubters that the tyrant had brought with him to destroy the poor town of\nMansoul.\n\nSo all betook themselves forthwith to their places—the Captains to\ntheirs, the Lord Mayor to his, the subordinate preacher to his, and my\nLord Willbewill to his.  The captains longed to be at some work for their\nprince; for they delighted in warlike achievements.  The next day,\ntherefore, they came together and consulted; and after consultation had,\nthey resolved to give an answer to the captain of Diabolus with slings;\nand so they did at the rising of the sun on the morrow; for Diabolus had\nadventured to come nearer again, but the sling-stones were to him and his\nlike hornets.  For as there is nothing to the town of Mansoul so terrible\nas the roaring of Diabolus’s drum, so there is nothing to Diabolus so\nterrible as the well playing of Emmanuel’s slings.  Wherefore Diabolus\nwas forced to make another retreat, yet further off from the famous town\nof Mansoul.  Then did the Lord Mayor of Mansoul cause the bells to be\nrung, ‘and that thanks should be sent to the Lord High Secretary by the\nmouth of the subordinate preacher; for that by his words the captains and\nelders of Mansoul had been strengthened against Diabolus.’\n\nWhen Diabolus saw that his captains and soldiers, high lords and\nrenowned, were frightened, and beaten down by the stones that came from\nthe golden slings of the Prince of the town of Mansoul, he bethought\nhimself, and said, ‘I will try to catch them by fawning, I will try to\nflatter them into my net.’\n\nWherefore, after a while, he came down again to the wall, not now with\nhis drum, nor with Captain Sepulchre; but having all besugared his lips,\nhe seemed to be a very sweet-mouthed, peaceable prince, designing nothing\nfor humour’s sake, nor to be revenged on Mansoul for injuries by them\ndone to him; but the welfare, and good, and advantage of the town and\npeople therein was now, as he said, his only design.  Wherefore, after he\nhad called for audience, and desired that the townsfolk would give it to\nhim, he proceeded in his oration, and said:—\n\n‘Oh, the desire of my heart, the famous town of Mansoul! how many nights\nhave I watched, and how many weary steps have I taken, if perhaps I might\ndo thee good!  Far be it, far be it from me to desire to make a war upon\nyou; if ye will but willingly and quietly deliver up yourselves unto me.\nYou know that you were mine of old.  Remember also, that so long as you\nenjoyed me for your lord, and that I enjoyed you for my subjects, you\nwanted for nothing of all the delights of the earth, that I, your lord\nand prince, could get for you, or that I could invent to make you bonny\nand blithe withal.  Consider, you never had so many hard, dark,\ntroublesome, and heart-afflicting hours, while you were mine, as you have\nhad since you revolted from me; nor shall you ever have peace again,\nuntil you and I become one as before.  But, be but prevailed with to\nembrace me again, and I will grant, yea, enlarge your old charter with\nabundance of privileges; so that your license and liberty shall be to\ntake, hold, enjoy, and make your own all that is pleasant from the east\nto the west.  Nor shall any of those incivilities, wherewith you have\noffended me, be ever charged upon you by me, so long as the sun and moon\nendure.  Nor shall any of those dear friends of mine that now, for the\nfear of you, lie lurking in dens, and holes, and caves in Mansoul, be\nhurtful to you any more; yea, they shall be your servants, and shall\nminister unto you of their substance, and of whatever shall come to hand.\nI need speak no more; you know them, and have sometime since been much\ndelighted in their company.  Why, then, should we abide at such odds?\nLet us renew our old acquaintance and friendship again.\n\n‘Bear with your friend; I take the liberty at this time to speak thus\nfreely unto you.  The love that I have to you presses me to do it, as\nalso does the zeal of my heart for my friends with you: put me not\ntherefore to further trouble, nor yourselves to further fears and\nfrights.  Have you I will, in a way of peace or war; nor do you flatter\nyourselves with the power and force of your captains, or that your\nEmmanuel will shortly come in to your help; for such strength will do you\nno pleasure.\n\n‘I am come against you with a stout and valiant army, and all the chief\nprinces of the den are even at the head of it.  Besides, my captains are\nswifter than eagles, stronger than lions, and more greedy of prey than\nare the evening wolves.  What is Og of Bashan! what is Goliath of Gath!\nand what are an hundred more of them, to one of the least of my captains!\nHow, then, shall Mansoul think to escape my hand and force?’\n\nDiabolus having thus handed his flattering, fawning, deceitful, and lying\nspeech to the famous town of Mansoul, the Lord Mayor replied to him as\nfollows: ‘O Diabolus, prince of darkness, and master of all deceit; thy\nlying flatteries we have had and made sufficient probation of, and have\ntasted too deeply of that destructive cup already.  Should we therefore\nagain hearken unto thee, and so break the commandments of our great\nShaddai, to join in affinity with thee, would not our Prince reject us,\nand cast us off for ever?  And, being cast off by him, can the place that\nhe has prepared for thee be a place of rest for us?  Besides, O thou that\nart empty and void of all truth, we are rather ready to die by thy hand,\nthan to fall in with thy flattering and lying deceits.’\n\nWhen the tyrant saw that there was little to be got by parleying with my\nLord Mayor, he fell into an hellish rage, and resolved that again, with\nhis army of doubters, he would another time assault the town of Mansoul.\n\nSo he called for his drummer, who beat up for his men (and while he did\nbeat, Mansoul did shake) to be in a readiness to give battle to the\ncorporation: then Diabolus drew near with his army, and thus disposed of\nhis men.  Captain Cruel and Captain Torment, these he drew up and placed\nagainst Feel-gate, and commanded them to sit down there for the war.  And\nhe also appointed that, if need were, Captain No-Ease should come in to\ntheir relief.  At Nose-gate he placed the Captain Brimstone and Captain\nSepulchre, and bid them look well to their ward, on that side of the town\nof Mansoul.  But at Eye-gate he placed that grim-faced one, the Captain\nPast-Hope, and there also now he did set up his terrible standard.\n\nNow Captain Insatiable, he was to look to the carriages of Diabolus, and\nwas also appointed to take into custody that, or those persons and\nthings, that should at any time as prey be taken from the enemy.\n\nNow Mouth-gate the inhabitants of Mansoul kept for a sally-port;\nwherefore that they kept strong; for that it was it by and out at which\nthe townsfolk did send their petitions to Emmanuel their Prince.  That\nalso was the gate from the top of which the captains did play their\nslings at the enemies; for that gate stood somewhat ascending, so that\nthe placing of them there, and the letting of them fly from that place,\ndid much execution against the tyrant’s army.  Wherefore, for these\ncauses, with others, Diabolus sought, if possible, to land up Mouth-gate\nwith dirt.\n\nNow, as Diabolus was busy and industrious in preparing to make his\nassault upon the town of Mansoul, without, so the captains and soldiers\nin the corporation were as busy in preparing within; they mounted their\nslings, they set up their banners, they sounded their trumpets, and put\nthemselves in such order as was judged most for the annoyance of the\nenemy, and for the advantage of Mansoul, and gave to their soldiers\norders to be ready at the sound of the trumpet for war.  The Lord\nWillbewill also, he took the charge of watching against the rebels\nwithin, and to do what he could to take them while without, or to stifle\nthem within their caves, dens, and holes in the town-wall of Mansoul.\nAnd, to speak the truth of him, ever since he took penance for his fault,\nhe has showed as much honesty and bravery of spirit as any he in Mansoul;\nfor he took one Jolly, and his brother Griggish, the two sons of his\nservant Harmless-Mirth, (for to that day, though the father was committed\nto ward, the sons had a dwelling in the house of my lord,)—I say, he took\nthem, and with his own hands put them to the cross.  And this was the\nreason why he hanged them up: after their father was put into the hands\nof Mr. True-Man the gaoler, they, his sons, began to play his pranks, and\nto be ticking and toying with the daughters of their lord; nay, it was\njealoused that they were too familiar with them, the which was brought to\nhis lordship’s ear.  Now his lordship being unwilling unadvisedly to put\nany man to death, did not suddenly fall upon them, but set watch and\nspies to see if the thing was true; of the which he was soon informed,\nfor his two servants, whose names were Find-Out and Tell-All, catched\nthem together in uncivil manner more than once or twice, and went and\ntold their lord.  So when my Lord Willbewill had sufficient ground to\nbelieve the thing was true, he takes the two young Diabolonians, (for\nsuch they were, for their father was a Diabolonian born,) and has them to\nEye-gate, where he raised a very high cross, just in the face of\nDiabolus, and of his army, and there he hanged the young villains, in\ndefiance to Captain Past-Hope, and of the horrible standard of the\ntyrant.\n\nNow this Christian act of the brave Lord Willbewill did greatly abash\nCaptain Past-Hope, discouraged the army of Diabolus, put fear into the\nDiabolonian runagates in Mansoul, and put strength and courage into the\ncaptains that belonged to Emmanuel, the Prince; for they without did\ngather, and that by this very act of my Lord, that Mansoul was resolved\nto fight, and that the Diabolonians within the town could not do such\nthings as Diabolus had hopes they would.  Nor was this the only proof of\nthe brave Lord Willbewill’s honesty to the town, nor of his loyalty to\nhis Prince, as will afterwards appear.\n\nNow, when the children of Prudent-Thrifty, who dwelt with Mr. Mind, (for\nThrift left children with Mr. Mind, when he was also committed to prison,\nand their names were Gripe and Rake-All; these he begat of Mr. Mind’s\nbastard daughter, whose name was Mrs. Hold-fast-Bad;)—I say, when his\nchildren perceived how the Lord Willbewill had served them that dwelt\nwith him, what do they but, lest they should drink of the same cup,\nendeavour to make their escape.  But Mr. Mind, being wary of it, took\nthem and put them in hold in his house till morning; (for this was done\nover night;) and remembering that by the law of Mansoul all Diabolonians\nwere to die, (and to be sure they were at least by father’s side such,\nand some say by mother’s side too,) what does he but takes them and puts\nthem in chains, and carries them to the selfsame place where my lord\nhanged his two before, and there he hanged them.\n\nThe townsmen also took great encouragement at this act of Mr. Mind, and\ndid what they could to have taken some more of these Diabolonian\ntroublers of Mansoul; but at that time the rest lay so squat and close,\nthat they could not be apprehended; so they set against them a diligent\nwatch, and went every man to his place.\n\nI told you a little before, that Diabolus and his army were somewhat\nabashed and discouraged at the sight of what my Lord Willbewill did, when\nhe hanged up those two young Diabolonians; but his discouragement quickly\nturned itself into furious madness and rage against the town of Mansoul,\nand fight it he would.  Also the townsmen and captains within, they had\ntheir hopes and their expectations heightened, believing at last the day\nwould be theirs; so they feared them the less.  Their subordinate\npreacher, too, made a sermon about it; and he took that theme for his\ntext, ‘Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the\nlast.’  Whence he showed, that though Mansoul should be sorely put to it\nat the first, yet the victory should most certainly be Mansoul’s at the\nlast.\n\nSo Diabolus commanded that his drummer should beat a charge against the\ntown; and the captains also that were in the town sounded a charge\nagainst them, but they had no drum: they were trumpets of silver with\nwhich they sounded against them.  Then they which were of the camp of\nDiabolus came down to the town to take it, and the captains in the\ncastle, with the slingers at Mouth-gate, played upon them amain.  And now\nthere was nothing heard in the camp of Diabolus but horrible rage and\nblasphemy; but in the town good words, prayer, and singing of psalms.\nThe enemy replied with horrible objections, and the terribleness of their\ndrum; but the town made answer with the slapping of their slings, and the\nmelodious noise of their trumpets.  And thus the fight lasted for several\ndays together, only now and then they had some small intermission, in the\nwhich the townsmen refreshed themselves, and the captains made ready for\nanother assault.\n\nThe captains of Emmanuel were clad in silver armour, and the soldiers in\nthat which was of proof; the soldiers of Diabolus were clad in iron which\nwas made to give place to Emmanuel’s engine-shot.  In the town, some were\nhurt, and some were greatly wounded.  Now, the worst of it was, a\nchirurgeon was scarce in Mansoul, for that Emmanuel at present was\nabsent.  Howbeit, with the leaves of a tree the wounded were kept from\ndying; yet their wounds did greatly putrefy, and some did grievously\nstink.  Of the townsmen, these were wounded, namely, my Lord Reason; he\nwas wounded in the head.  Another that was wounded was the brave Lord\nMayor; he was wounded in the eye.  Another that was wounded was Mr. Mind;\nhe received his wound about the stomach.  The honest subordinate preacher\nalso, he received a shot not far off the heart but none of these were\nmortal.\n\nMany also of the inferior sort were not only wounded but slain outright.\n\nNow, in the camp of Diabolus were wounded and slain a considerable\nnumber; for instance, Captain Rage, he was wounded, and so was Captain\nCruel.  Captain Damnation was made to retreat, and to intrench himself\nfurther off of Mansoul.  The standard also of Diabolus was beaten down,\nand his standard-bearer, Captain Much-Hurt, had his brains beat out with\na sling-stone, to the no little grief and shame of his prince Diabolus.\n\nMany also of the doubters were slain outright, though enough of them were\nleft alive to make Mansoul shake and totter.  Now the victory that day\nbeing turned to Mansoul, did put great valour into the townsmen and\ncaptains, and did cover Diabolus’s camp with a cloud, but withal it made\nthem far more furious.  So the next day Mansoul rested, and commanded\nthat the bells should be rung; the trumpets also joyfully sounded, and\nthe captains shouted round the town.\n\nMy Lord Willbewill also was not idle, but did notable service within\nagainst the domestics, or the Diabolonians that were in the town, not\nonly by keeping them in awe, for he lighted on one at last whose name was\nMr. Anything, a fellow of whom mention was made before; for it was he, if\nyou remember, that brought the three fellows to Diabolus, whom the\nDiabolonians took out of Captain Boanerges’s companies, and that\npersuaded them to list themselves under the tyrant, to fight against the\narmy of Shaddai.  My Lord Willbewill did also take a notable Diabolonian,\nwhose name was Loose-Foot: this Loose-Foot was a scout to the vagabonds\nin Mansoul, and that did use to carry tidings out of Mansoul to the camp,\nand out of the camp to those of the enemies in Mansoul.  Both these my\nlord sent away safe to Mr. True-Man, the gaoler, with a commandment to\nkeep them in irons; for he intended then to have them out to be\ncrucified, when it would be for the best to the corporation, and most for\nthe discouragement of the camp of the enemies.\n\nMy Lord Mayor also, though he could not stir about so much as formerly,\nbecause of the wound that he lately received, yet gave he out orders to\nall that were the natives of Mansoul, to look to their watch, and stand\nupon their guard, and, as occasion should offer, to prove themselves men.\n\nMr. Conscience, the preacher, he also did his utmost to keep all his good\ndocuments alive upon the hearts of the people of Mansoul.\n\nWell, awhile after, the captains and stout ones of the town of Mansoul\nagreed and resolved upon a time to make a sally out upon the camp of\nDiabolus, and this must be done in the night; and there was the folly of\nMansoul, (for the night is always the best for the enemy, but the worst\nfor Mansoul to fight in,) but yet they would do it, their courage was so\nhigh; their last victory also still stuck in their memories.\n\nSo the night appointed being come, the Prince’s brave captains cast lots\nwho should lead the van in this new and desperate expedition against\nDiabolus, and against his Diabolonian army; and the lot fell to Captain\nCredence, to Captain Experience, and to Captain Good-Hope, to lead the\nforlorn hope.  (This Captain Experience the Prince created such when\nhimself did reside in the town of Mansoul.)  So, as I said, they made\ntheir sally out upon the army that lay in the siege against them; and\ntheir hap was to fall in with the main body of their enemies.  Now\nDiabolus and his men being expertly accustomed to night-work, took the\nalarm presently, and were as ready to give them battle, as if they had\nsent them word of their coming.  Wherefore to it they went amain, and\nblows were hard on every side; the hell drum also was beat most\nfuriously, while the trumpets of the Prince most sweetly sounded.  And\nthus the battle was joined; and Captain Insatiable looked to the enemy’s\ncarriages, and waited when he should receive some prey.\n\nThe Prince’s captains fought it stoutly, beyond what indeed could be\nexpected they should; they wounded many; they made the whole army of\nDiabolus to make a retreat.  But I cannot tell how, but the brave Captain\nCredence, Captain Good-Hope, and Captain Experience, as they were upon\nthe pursuit, cutting down, and following hard after the enemy in the\nrear, Captain Credence stumbled and fell, by which fall he caught so\ngreat a hurt, that he could not rise till Captain Experience did help him\nup, at which their men were put in disorder.  The captain also was so\nfull of pain, that he could not forbear but aloud to cry out: at this,\nthe other two captains fainted, supposing that Captain Credence had\nreceived his mortal wound; their men also were more disordered, and had\nno list to fight.  Now Diabolus being very observing, though at this time\nas yet he was put to the worst, perceiving that a halt was made among the\nmen that were the pursuers, what does he but, taking it for granted that\nthe captains were either wounded or dead, he therefore makes at first a\nstand, then faces about, and so comes up upon the Prince’s army with as\nmuch of his fury as hell could help him to; and his hap was to fall in\njust among the three captains, Captain Credence, Captain Good-Hope, and\nCaptain Experience, and did cut, wound, and pierce them so dreadfully,\nthat what through discouragement, what through disorder, and what through\nthe wounds that they had received, and also the loss of much blood, they\nscarce were able, though they had for their power the three best hands in\nMansoul, to get safe into the hold again.\n\nNow, when the body of the Prince’s army saw how these three captains were\nput to the worst, they thought it their wisdom to make as safe and good a\nretreat as they could, and so returned by the sally-port again; and so\nthere was an end of this present action.  But Diabolus was so flushed\nwith this night’s work, that he promised himself, in few days, an easy\nand complete conquest over the town of Mansoul; wherefore, on the day\nfollowing, he comes up to the sides thereof with great boldness, and\ndemands entrance, and that forthwith they deliver themselves up to his\ngovernment.  The Diabolonians, too, that were within, they began to be\nsomewhat brisk, as we shall show afterward.\n\nBut the valiant Lord Mayor replied, that what he got he must get by\nforce; for as long as Emmanuel, their Prince, was alive, (though he at\npresent was not so with them as they wished,) they should never consent\nto yield Mansoul up to another.\n\nAnd with that the Lord Willbewill stood up, and said, ‘Diabolus, thou\nmaster of the den, and enemy to all that is good, we poor inhabitants of\nthe town of Mansoul are too well acquainted with thy rule and government,\nand with the end of those things that for certain will follow submitting\nto thee, to do it.  Wherefore though while we were without knowledge we\nsuffered thee to take us, (as the bird that saw not the snare fell into\nthe hands of the fowler,) yet since we have been turned from darkness to\nlight, we have also been turned from the power of Satan to God.  And\nthough through thy subtlety, and also the subtlety of the Diabolonians\nwithin, we have sustained much loss, and also plunged ourselves into much\nperplexity, yet give up ourselves, lay down our arms, and yield to so\nhorrid a tyrant as thou, we shall not; die upon the place we choose\nrather to do.  Besides, we have hopes that in time deliverance will come\nfrom court unto us, and therefore we yet will maintain a war against\nthee.’\n\nThis brave speech of the Lord Willbewill, with that also of the Lord\nMayor, did somewhat abate the boldness of Diabolus, though it kindled the\nfury of his rage.  It also succoured the townsmen and captains; yea, it\nwas as a plaster to the brave Captain Credence’s wound; for you must know\nthat a brave speech now (when the captains of the town with their men of\nwar came home routed, and when the enemy took courage and boldness at the\nsuccess that he had obtained to draw up to the walls, and demand\nentrance, as he did) was in season, and also advantageous.\n\nThe Lord Willbewill also did play the man within; for while the captains\nand soldiers were in the field, he was in arms in the town, and wherever\nby him there was a Diabolonian found, they were forced to feel the weight\nof his heavy hand, and also the edge of his penetrating sword: many\ntherefore of the Diabolonians he wounded, as the Lord Cavil, the Lord\nBrisk, the Lord Pragmatic, and the Lord Murmur; several also of the\nmeaner sort he did sorely maim; though there cannot at this time an\naccount be given you of any that he slew outright.  The cause, or rather\nthe advantage that my Lord Willbewill had at this time to do thus, was\nfor that the captains were gone out to fight the enemy in the field.\n‘For now,’ thought the Diabolonians within, ‘is our time to stir and make\nan uproar in the town.’  What do they therefore but quickly get\nthemselves into a body, and fall forthwith to hurricaning in Mansoul, as\nif now nothing but whirlwind and tempest should be there.  Wherefore, as\nI said, he takes this opportunity to fall in among them with his men,\ncutting and slashing with courage that was undaunted; at which the\nDiabolonians with all haste dispersed themselves to their holds, and my\nlord to his place as before.\n\nThis brave act of my lord did somewhat revenge the wrong done by Diabolus\nto the captains, and also did let them know that Mansoul was not to be\nparted with for the loss of a victory or two; wherefore the wing of the\ntyrant was clipped again, as to boasting,—I mean in comparison of what he\nwould have done, if the Diabolonians had put the town to the same plight\nto which he had put the captains.\n\nWell, Diabolus yet resolves to have the other bout with Mansoul.  ‘For,’\nthought he, ‘since I beat them once, I may beat them twice.’  Wherefore\nhe commanded his men to be ready at such an hour of the night, to make a\nfresh assault upon the town; and he gave it out in special that they\nshould bend all their force against Feel-gate, and attempt to break into\nthe town through that.  The word that then he did give to his officers\nand soldiers was Hell-fire.  ‘And,’ said he, ‘if we break in upon them,\nas I wish we do, either with some, or with all our force, let them that\nbreak in look to it, that they forget not the word.  And let nothing be\nheard in the town of Mansoul but, “Hell-fire!  Hell-fire! Hell-fire!”’\nThe drummer was also to beat without ceasing, and the standard-bearers\nwere to display their colours; the soldiers, too, were to put on what\ncourage they could, and to see that they played manfully their parts\nagainst the town.\n\nSo when night was come, and all things by the tyrant made ready for the\nwork, he suddenly makes his assault upon Feel-gate, and after he had\nawhile struggled there, he throws the gate wide open: for the truth is,\nthose gates were but weak, and so most easily made to yield.  When\nDiabolus had thus far made his attempt, he placed his captains (namely,\nTorment and No-Ease) there; so he attempted to press forward, but the\nPrince’s captains came down upon him, and made his entrance more\ndifficult than he desired.  And, to speak truth, they made what\nresistance they could; but the three of their best and most valiant\ncaptains being wounded, and by their wounds made much incapable of doing\nthe town that service they would, (and all the rest having more than\ntheir hands full of the doubters, and their captains that did follow\nDiabolus,) they were overpowered with force, nor could they keep them out\nof the town.  Wherefore the Prince’s men and their captains betook\nthemselves to the castle, as to the stronghold of the town: and this they\ndid partly for their own security, partly for the security of the town,\nand partly, or rather chiefly, to preserve to Emmanuel the\nprerogative-royal of Mansoul; for so was the castle of Mansoul.\n\nThe captains therefore being fled into the castle, the enemy, without\nmuch resistance, possess themselves of the rest of the town, and\nspreading themselves as they went into every corner, they cried out as\nthey marched, according to the command of the tyrant, ‘Hell-fire!\nHell-fire! Hell-fire!’ so that nothing for a while throughout the town of\nMansoul could be heard but the direful noise of ‘Hell-fire!’ together\nwith the roaring of Diabolus’s drum.  And now did the clouds hang black\nover Mansoul, nor to reason did anything but ruin seem to attend it.\nDiabolus also quartered his soldiers in the houses of the inhabitants of\nthe town of Mansoul.  Yea, the subordinate preacher’s house was as full\nof these outlandish doubters as ever it could hold, and so was my Lord\nMayor’s, and my Lord Willbewill’s also.  Yea, where was there a corner, a\ncottage, a barn, or a hogstye, that now was not full of these vermin?\nYea, they turned the men of the town out of their houses, and would lie\nin their beds, and sit at their tables themselves.  Ah, poor Mansoul! now\nthou feelest the fruits of sin, yea, what venom was in the flattering\nwords of Mr. Carnal-Security!  They made great havoc of whatever they\nlaid their hands on; yea, they fired the town in several places; many\nyoung children also were by them dashed in pieces; and those that were\nyet unborn they destroyed in their mothers’ wombs: for you must needs\nthink that it could not now be otherwise; for what conscience, what pity,\nwhat bowels of compassion can any expect at the hands of outlandish\ndoubters?  Many in Mansoul that were women, both young and old, they\nforced, ravished, and beastlike abused, so that they swooned, miscarried,\nand many of them died, and so lay at the top of every street, and in all\nby-places of the town.\n\nAnd now did Mansoul seem to be nothing but a den of dragons, an emblem of\nhell, and a place of total darkness.  Now did Mansoul lie almost like the\nbarren wilderness; nothing but nettles, briars, thorns, weeds, and\nstinking things seemed now to cover the face of Mansoul.  I told you\nbefore, how that these Diabolonian doubters turned the men of Mansoul out\nof their beds, and now I will add, they wounded them, they mauled them,\nyea, and almost brained many of them.  Many did I say, yea most, if not\nall of them.  Mr. Conscience they so wounded, yea, and his wounds so\nfestered, that he could have no ease day nor night, but lay as if\ncontinually upon a rack; but that Shaddai rules all, certainly they had\nslain him outright.  Mr. Lord Mayor they so abused that they almost put\nout his eyes; and had not my Lord Willbewill got into the castle, they\nintended to have chopped him all to pieces; for they did look upon him,\nas his heart now stood, to be one of the very worst that was in Mansoul\nagainst Diabolus and his crew.  And indeed he hath shown himself a man,\nand more of his exploits you will hear of afterwards.\n\nNow, a man might have walked for days together in Mansoul, and scarcely\nhave seen one in the town that looked like a religious man.  Oh, the\nfearful state of Mansoul now! now every corner swarmed with outlandish\ndoubters; red-coats and black-coats walked the town by clusters, and\nfilled up all the houses with hideous noises, vain songs, lying stories,\nand blasphemous language against Shaddai and his Son.  Now also those\nDiabolonians that lurked in the walls and dens and holes that were in the\ntown of Mansoul, came forth and showed themselves; yea, walked with open\nface in company with the doubters that were in Mansoul.  Yea, they had\nmore boldness now to walk the streets, to haunt the houses, and to show\nthemselves abroad, than had any of the honest inhabitants of the now\nwoful town of Mansoul.\n\nBut Diabolus and his outlandish men were not at peace in Mansoul; for\nthey were not there entertained as were the captains and forces of\nEmmanuel: the townsmen did browbeat them what they could; nor did they\npartake or make stroy of any of the necessaries of Mansoul, but that\nwhich they seized on against the townsmen’s will: what they could, they\nhid from them, and what they could not, they had with an ill-will.  They,\npoor hearts! had rather have had their room than their company; but they\nwere at present their captives, and their captives for the present they\nwere forced to be.  But, I say, they discountenanced them as much as they\nwere able, and showed them all the dislike that they could.\n\nThe captains also from the castle did hold them in continual play with\ntheir slings, to the chafing and fretting of the minds of the enemies.\nTrue, Diabolus made a great many attempts to have broken open the gates\nof the castle, but Mr. Godly-Fear was made the keeper of that; and he was\na man of that courage, conduct, and valour, that it was in vain, as long\nas life lasted within him, to think to do that work, though mostly\ndesired; wherefore all the attempts that Diabolus made against him were\nfruitless.  I have wished sometimes that that man had had the whole rule\nof the town of Mansoul.\n\nWell, this was the condition of the town of Mansoul for about two years\nand a half: the body of the town was the seat of war, the people of the\ntown were driven into holes, and the glory of Mansoul was laid in the\ndust.  What rest, then, could be to the inhabitants, what peace could\nMansoul have, and what sun could shine upon it?  Had the enemy lain so\nlong without in the plain against the town, it had been enough to have\nfamished them: but now, when they shall be within, when the town shall be\ntheir tent, their trench and fort against the castle that was in the\ntown; when the town shall be against the town, and shall serve to be a\ndefence to the enemies of her strength and life: I say, when they shall\nmake use of the forts and town-holds to secure themselves in, even till\nthey shall take, spoil, and demolish the castle,—this was terrible! and\nyet this was now the state of the town of Mansoul.\n\nAfter the town of Mansoul had been in this sad and lamentable condition,\nfor so long a time as I have told you, and no petitions that they\npresented their Prince with, all this while, could prevail, the\ninhabitants of the town, namely, the elders and chief of Mansoul,\ngathered together, and, after some time spent in condoling their\nmiserable state and this miserable judgment coming upon them, they agreed\ntogether to draw up yet another petition, and to send it away to Emmanuel\nfor relief.  But Mr. Godly-Fear stood up and answered, that he knew that\nhis Lord the Prince never did nor ever would receive a petition for these\nmatters, from the hand of any whoever, unless the Lord Secretary’s hand\nwas to it; ‘and this,’ quoth he, ‘is the reason that you prevailed not\nall this while.’  Then they said they would draw up one, and get the Lord\nSecretary’s hand unto it.  But Mr. Godly-Fear answered again, that he\nknew also that the Lord Secretary would not set his hand to any petition\nthat himself had not an hand in composing and drawing up.  ‘And besides,’\nsaid he, ‘the Prince doth know my Lord Secretary’s hand from all the\nhands in the world; wherefore he cannot be deceived by any pretence\nwhatever.  Wherefore my advice is that you go to my Lord, and implore him\nto lend you his aid.’  (Now he did yet abide in the castle, where all the\ncaptains and men-at-arms were.)\n\nSo they heartily thanked Mr. Godly-Fear, took his counsel, and did as he\nhad bidden them.  So they went and came to my Lord, and made known the\ncause of their coming to him; namely, that since Mansoul was in so\ndeplorable a condition, his Highness would be pleased to undertake to\ndraw up a petition for them to Emmanuel, the Son of the mighty Shaddai,\nand to their King and his Father by him.\n\nThen said the Secretary to them, ‘What petition is it that you would have\nme draw up for you?’  But they said, ‘Our Lord knows best the state and\ncondition of the town of Mansoul; and how we are backslidden and\ndegenerated from the Prince: thou also knowest who is come up to war\nagainst us, and how Mansoul is now the seat of war.  My Lord knows,\nmoreover, what barbarous usages our men, women, and children have\nsuffered at their hands; and how our homebred Diabolonians do walk now\nwith more boldness than dare the townsmen in the streets of Mansoul.  Let\nour Lord therefore, according to the wisdom of God that is in him, draw\nup a petition for his poor servants to our Prince Emmanuel.’  ‘Well,’\nsaid the Lord Secretary, ‘I will draw up a petition for you, and will\nalso set my hand thereto.’  Then said they, ‘But when shall we call for\nit at the hands of our Lord?’  But he answered, ‘Yourselves must be\npresent at the doing of it; yea, you must put your desires to it.  True,\nthe hand and pen shall be mine, but the ink and paper must be yours; else\nhow can you say it is your petition?  Nor have I need to petition for\nmyself, because I have not offended.’ He also added as followeth: ‘No\npetition goes from me in my name to the Prince, and so to his Father by\nhim, but when the people that are chiefly concerned therein do join in\nheart and soul in the matter, for that must be inserted therein.’\n\nSo they did heartily agree with the sentence of the Lord, and a petition\nwas forthwith drawn up for them.  But now, who should carry it? that was\nnext.  But the Secretary advised that Captain Credence should carry it;\nfor he was a well-spoken man.  They therefore called for him, and\npropounded to him the business.  ‘Well,’ said the captain, ‘I gladly\naccept of the motion; and though I am lame, I will do this business for\nyou with as much speed, and as well as I can.’\n\nThe contents of the petition were to this purpose\n\n‘O our Lord, and Sovereign Prince Emmanuel, the potent, the\nlong-suffering Prince! grace is poured into thy lips, and to thee belong\nmercy and forgiveness, though we have rebelled against thee.  We, who are\nno more worthy to be called thy Mansoul, nor yet fit to partake of common\nbenefits, do beseech thee, and thy Father by thee, to do away our\ntransgressions.  We confess that thou mightest cast us away for them; but\ndo it not for thy name’s sake: let the Lord rather take an opportunity,\nat our miserable condition, to let out his bowels and compassions to us.\nWe are compassed on every side, Lord; our own backslidings reprove us;\nour Diabolonians within our town fright us; and the army of the angel of\nthe bottomless pit distresses us.  Thy grace can be our salvation, and\nwhither to go but to thee we know not.\n\n‘Furthermore, O gracious Prince, we have weakened our captains, and they\nare discouraged, sick, and, of late, some of them grievously worsted and\nbeaten out of the field by the power and force of the tyrant.  Yea, even\nthose of our captains, in whose valour we did formerly use to put most of\nour confidence, they are as wounded men.  Besides, Lord, our enemies are\nlively, and they are strong; they vaunt and boast themselves, and do\nthreaten to part us among themselves for a booty.  They are fallen also\nupon us, Lord, with many thousand doubters, such as with whom we cannot\ntell what to do; they are all grim-looked and unmerciful ones, and they\nbid defiance to us and thee.\n\n‘Our wisdom is gone, our power is gone, because thou art departed from\nus; nor have we what we may call ours but sin, shame, and confusion of\nface for sin.  Take pity upon us, O Lord, take pity upon us, thy\nmiserable town of Mansoul, and save us out of the hands of our enemies.\nAmen.’\n\nThis petition, as was touched afore, was handed by the Lord Secretary,\nand carried to the court by the brave and most stout Captain Credence.\nNow he carried it out at Mouth-gate, (for that, as I said, was the\nsally-port of the town,) and he went and came to Emmanuel with it.  Now\nhow it came out, I do not know; but for certain it did, and that so far\nas to reach the ears of Diabolus.  Thus I conclude, because that the\ntyrant had it presently by the end, and charged the town of Mansoul with\nit, saying, ‘Thou rebellious and stubborn-hearted Mansoul, I will make\nthee to leave off petitioning.  Art thou yet for petitioning?  I will\nmake thee to leave.’  Yea, he also knew who the messenger was that\ncarried the petition to the Prince, and it made him both to fear and\nrage.\n\nWherefore he commanded that his drum should be beat again, a thing that\nMansoul could not abide to hear: but when Diabolus will have his drum\nbeat, Mansoul must abide the noise.  Well, the drum was beat, and the\nDiabolonians were gathered together.\n\nThen said Diabolus, ‘O ye stout Diabolonians, be it known unto you, that\nthere is treachery hatched against us in the rebellious town of Mansoul;\nfor albeit the town is in our possession, as you see, yet these miserable\nMansoulians have attempted to dare, and have been so hardy as yet to send\nto the court to Emmanuel for help.  This I give you to understand, that\nye may yet know how to carry it to the wretched town of Mansoul.\nWherefore, O my trusty Diabolonians, I command that yet more and more ye\ndistress this town of Mansoul, and vex it with your wiles, ravish their\nwomen, deflower their virgins, slay their children, brain their ancients,\nfire their town, and what other mischief you can; and let this be the\nreward of the Mansoulians from me, for their desperate rebellions against\nme.’\n\nThis, you see, was the charge; but something stepped in betwixt that and\nexecution, for as yet there was but little more done than to rage.\n\nMoreover, when Diabolus had done thus, he went the next way up to the\ncastle gates, and demanded that, upon pain of death, the gates should be\nopened to him, and that entrance should be given him and his men that\nfollowed after.  To whom Mr. Godly-Fear replied, (for he it was that had\nthe charge of that gate,) that the gate should not be opened unto him,\nnor to the men that followed after him.  He said, moreover, that Mansoul,\nwhen she had suffered awhile, should be made perfect, strengthened,\nsettled.\n\nThen said Diabolus, ‘Deliver me, then, the men that have petitioned\nagainst me, especially Captain Credence, that carried it to your Prince;\ndeliver that varlet into my hands, and I will depart from the town.’\n\nThen up starts a Diabolonian, whose name was Mr. Fooling, and said, ‘My\nlord offereth you fair: it is better for you that one man perish, than\nthat your whole Mansoul should be undone.’\n\nBut Mr. Godly-Fear made him this replication, ‘How long will Mansoul be\nkept out of the dungeon, when she hath given up her faith to Diabolus!\nAs good lose the town, as lose Captain Credence; for if one be gone the\nother must follow.’  But to that Mr. Fooling said nothing.\n\nThen did my Lord Mayor reply, and said, ‘O thou devouring tyrant, be it\nknown unto thee, we shall hearken to none of thy words; we are resolved\nto resist thee as long as a captain, a man, a sling, and a stone to throw\nat thee shall be found in the town of Mansoul.’  But Diabolus answered,\n‘Do you hope, do you wait, do you look for help and deliverance?  You\nhave sent to Emmanuel, but your wickedness sticks too close in your\nskirts, to let innocent prayers come out of your lips.  Think you that\nyou shall be prevailers and prosper in this design?  You will fail in\nyour wish, you will fail in your attempts; for it is not only I, but your\nEmmanuel is against you: yea, it is he that hath sent me against you to\nsubdue you.  For what, then, do you hope? or by what means will you\nescape?’\n\nThen said the Lord Mayor, ‘We have sinned indeed; but that shall be no\nhelp to thee, for our Emmanuel hath said it, and that in great\nfaithfulness, “and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.”  He\nhath also told us, O our enemy, that “all manner of sin and blasphemy\nshall be forgiven” to the sons of men.  Therefore we dare not despair,\nbut will look for, wait for, and hope for deliverance still.’\n\nNow, by this time, Captain Credence was returned and come from the court\nfrom Emmanuel to the castle of Mansoul, and he returned to them with a\npacket.  So my Lord Mayor, hearing that Captain Credence was come,\nwithdrew himself from the noise of the roaring of the tyrant, and left\nhim to yell at the wall of the town, or against the gates of the castle.\nSo he came up to the captain’s lodgings, and saluting him, he asked him\nof his welfare, and what was the best news at court.  But when he asked\nCaptain Credence that, the water stood in his eyes.  Then said the\ncaptain, ‘Cheer up, my lord, for all will be well in time.’  And with\nthat he first produced his packet, and laid it by; but that the Lord\nMayor, and the rest of the captains, took for sign of good tidings.  Now\na season of grace being come, he sent for all the captains and elders of\nthe town, that were here and there in their lodgings in the castle and\nupon their guard, to let them know that Captain Credence was returned\nfrom the court, and that he had something in general, and something in\nspecial, to communicate to them.  So they all came up to him, and saluted\nhim, and asked him concerning his journey, and what was the best news at\nthe court.  And he answered them as he had done the Lord Mayor before,\nthat all would be well at last.  Now, when the captain had thus saluted\nthem, he opened his packet, and thence did draw out his several notes for\nthose that he had sent for.\n\nAnd the first note was for my Lord Mayor, wherein was signified:—That the\nPrince Emmanuel had taken it well that my Lord Mayor had been so true and\ntrusty in his office, and the great concerns that lay upon him for the\ntown and people of Mansoul.  Also, he bid him to know, that he took it\nwell that he had been so bold for his Prince Emmanuel, and had engaged so\nfaithfully in his cause against Diabolus.  He also signified, at the\nclose of his letter, that he should shortly receive his reward.\n\nThe second note that came out, was for the noble Lord Willbewill, wherein\nthere was signified:—That his Prince Emmanuel did well understand how\nvaliant and courageous he had been for the honour of his Lord, now in his\nabsence, and when his name was under contempt by Diabolus.  There was\nsignified also, that his Prince had taken it well that he had been so\nfaithful to the town of Mansoul, in his keeping of so strict a hand and\neye over and so strict a rein upon the neck of the Diabolonians, that did\nstill lie lurking in their several holes in the famous town of Mansoul.\nHe signified, moreover, how that he understood that my Lord had, with his\nown hand, done great execution upon some of the chief of the rebels\nthere, to the great discouragement of the adverse party and to the good\nexample of the whole town of Mansoul; and that shortly his lordship\nshould have his reward.\n\nThe third note came out for the subordinate preacher, wherein was\nsignified:—That his Prince took it well from him, that he had so honestly\nand so faithfully performed his office, and executed the trust committed\nto him by his Lord, while he exhorted, rebuked, and forewarned Mansoul\naccording to the laws of the town.  He signified, moreover, that he took\nit well at his hand that he called to fasting, to sackcloth, and ashes,\nwhen Mansoul was under her revolt.  Also, that he called for the aid of\nthe Captain Boanerges to help in so weighty a work; and that shortly he\nalso should receive his reward.\n\nThe fourth note came out for Mr. Godly-Fear, wherein his Lord thus\nsignified:—That his Lordship observed, that he was the first of all the\nmen in Mansoul that detected Mr. Carnal-Security as the only one that,\nthrough his subtlety and cunning, had obtained for Diabolus a defection\nand decay of goodness in the blessed town of Mansoul.  Moreover, his Lord\ngave him to understand, that he still remembered his tears and mourning\nfor the state of Mansoul.  It was also observed, by the same note, that\nhis Lord took notice of his detecting of this Mr. Carnal-Security, at his\nown table among his guests, in his own house, and that in the midst of\nhis jolliness, even while he was seeking to perfect his villanies against\nthe town of Mansoul.  Emmanuel also took notice that this reverend\nperson, Mr. Godly-Fear, stood stoutly to it, at the gates of the castle,\nagainst all the threats and attempts of the tyrant; and that he had put\nthe townsmen in a way to make their petition to their Prince, so as that\nhe might accept thereof, and as they might obtain an answer of peace; and\nthat therefore shortly he should receive his reward.\n\nAfter all this, there was yet produced a note which was written to the\nwhole town of Mansoul, whereby they perceived—That their Lord took notice\nof their so often repeating of petitions to him; and that they should see\nmore of the fruits of such their doings in time to come.  Their Prince\ndid also therein tell them, that he took it well, that their heart and\nmind, now at last, abode fixed upon him and his ways, though Diabolus had\nmade such inroads upon them; and that neither flatteries on the one hand,\nnor hardships on the other, could make them yield to serve his cruel\ndesigns.  There was also inserted at the bottom of this note—That his\nLordship had left the town of Mansoul in the hands of the Lord Secretary,\nand under the conduct of Captain Credence, saying, ‘Beware that you yet\nyield yourselves unto their governance; and in due time you shall receive\nyour reward.’\n\nSo, after the brave Captain Credence had delivered his notes to those to\nwhom they belonged, he retired himself to my Lord Secretary’s lodgings,\nand there spends time in conversing with him; for they too were very\ngreat one with another, and did indeed know more how things would go with\nMansoul than did all the townsmen besides.  The Lord Secretary also loved\nthe Captain Credence dearly; yea, many a good bit was sent him from my\nLord’s table; also, he might have a show of countenance, when the rest of\nMansoul lay under the clouds: so, after some time for converse was spent,\nthe captain betook himself to his chambers to rest.  But it was not long\nafter when my Lord did send for the captain again; so the captain came to\nhim, and they greeted one another with usual salutations.  Then said the\ncaptain to the Lord Secretary, ‘What hath my Lord to say to his servant?’\nSo the Lord Secretary took him and had him aside, and after a sign or two\nof more favour, he said, ‘I have made thee the Lord’s lieutenant over all\nthe forces in Mansoul; so that, from this day forward, all men in Mansoul\nshall be at thy word; and thou shalt be he that shall lead in, and that\nshall lead out Mansoul.  Thou shalt therefore manage, according to thy\nplace, the war for thy Prince, and for the town of Mansoul, against the\nforce and power of Diabolus; and at thy command shall the rest of the\ncaptains be.’\n\nNow the townsmen began to perceive what interest the captain had, both\nwith the court, and also with the Lord Secretary in Mansoul; for no man\nbefore could speed when sent, nor bring such good news from Emmanuel as\nhe.  Wherefore what do they, after some lamentation that they made no\nmore use of him in their distresses, but send by their subordinate\npreacher to the Lord Secretary, to desire him that all that ever they\nwere and had might be put under the government, care, custody, and\nconduct of Captain Credence.\n\nSo their preacher went and did his errand, and received this answer from\nthe mouth of his Lord: that Captain Credence should be the great doer in\nall the King’s army, against the King’s enemies, and also for the welfare\nof Mansoul.  So he bowed to the ground, and thanked his Lordship, and\nreturned and told his news to the townsfolk.  But all this was done with\nall imaginable secrecy, because the foes had yet great strength in the\ntown.  But to return to our story again.\n\nWhen Diabolus saw himself thus boldly confronted by the Lord Mayor, and\nperceived the stoutness of Mr. Godly-Fear, he fell into a rage, and\nforthwith called a council of war, that he might be revenged on Mansoul.\nSo all the princes of the pit came together, and old Incredulity at the\nhead of them, with all the captains of his army.  So they consult what to\ndo.  Now the effect and conclusion of the council that day was how they\nmight take the castle, because they could not conclude themselves masters\nof the town so long as that was in the possession of their enemies.\n\nSo one advised this way, and another advised that; but when they could\nnot agree in their verdict, Apollyon, that president of the council,\nstood up, and thus he began: ‘My brotherhood,’ quoth he, ‘I have two\nthings to propound unto you; and my first is this.  Let us withdraw\nourselves from the town into the plain again, for our presence here will\ndo us no good, because the castle is yet in our enemies’ hands; nor is it\npossible that we should take that, so long as so many brave captains are\nin it, and that this bold fellow, Godly-Fear, is made the keeper of the\ngates of it.  Now, when we have withdrawn ourselves into the plain, they,\nof their own accord, will be glad of some little ease; and it may be, of\ntheir own accord, they again may begin to be remiss, and even their so\nbeing will give them a bigger blow than we can possibly give them\nourselves.  But if that should fail, our going forth of the town may draw\nthe captains out after us; and you know what it cost them when we fought\nthem in the field before.  Besides, can we but draw them out into the\nfield, we may lay an ambush behind the town, which shall, when they are\ncome forth abroad, rush in and take possession of the castle.’\n\nBut Beelzebub stood up, and replied, saying: ‘It is impossible to draw\nthem all off from the castle; some, you may be sure, will lie there to\nkeep that; wherefore it will be but in vain thus to attempt, unless we\nwere sure that they will all come out.’  He therefore concluded that what\nwas done must be done by some other means.  And the most likely means\nthat the greatest of their heads could invent, was that which Apollyon\nhad advised to before, namely, to get the townsmen again to sin.  ‘For,’\nsaid he, ‘it is not our being in the town, nor in the field, nor our\nfighting, nor our killing of their men, that can make us the masters of\nMansoul; for so long as one in the town is able to lift up his finger\nagainst us, Emmanuel will take their parts; and if he shall take their\nparts, we know what time of day it will be with us.  Wherefore, for my\npart,’ quoth he, ‘there is, in my judgment, no way to bring them into\nbondage to us, like inventing a way to make them sin.  Had we,’ said he,\n‘left all our doubters at home, we had done as well as we have done now,\nunless we could have made them the masters and governors of the castle;\nfor doubters at a distance are but like objections refelled with\narguments.  Indeed, can we but get them into the hold, and make them\npossessors of that, the day will be our own.  Let us, therefore, withdraw\nourselves into the plain, (not expecting that the captains in Mansoul\nshould follow us,) but yet, I say, let us do this, and before we so do,\nlet us advise again with our trusty Diabolonians that are yet in their\nholds of Mansoul, and set them to work to betray the town to us; for they\nindeed must do it, or it will be left undone for ever.’  By these sayings\nof Beelzebub, (for I think it was he that gave this counsel,) the whole\nconclave was forced to be of his opinion, namely, that the way to get the\ncastle was to get the town to sin.  Then they fell to inventing by what\nmeans they might do this thing.\n\nThen Lucifer stood up, and said: ‘The counsel of Beelzebub is pertinent.\nNow, the way to bring this to pass, in mine opinion, is this: let us\nwithdraw our force from the town of Mansoul; let us do this, and let us\nterrify them no more, either with summons, or threats, or with the noise\nof our drum, or any other awakening means.  Only let us lie in the field\nat a distance, and be as if we regarded them not; for frights, I see, do\nbut awaken them, and make them more stand to their arms.  I have also\nanother stratagem in my head: you know Mansoul is a market-town, and a\ntown that delights in commerce; what, therefore, if some of our\nDiabolonians shall feign themselves far-country men, and shall go out and\nbring to the market of Mansoul some of our wares to sell; and what matter\nat what rates they sell their wares, though it be but for half the worth?\nNow, let those that thus shall trade in their market be those that are\nwitty and true to us, and I will lay my crown to pawn it will do.  There\nare two that are come to my thoughts already, that I think will be arch\nat this work, and they are Mr. Penny-wise-pound-foolish, and Mr.\nGet-i’the-hundred-and-lose-i’the-shire; nor is this man with the long\nname at all inferior to the other.  What, also, if you join with them Mr.\nSweet-world and Mr. Present-good; they are men that are civil and\ncunning, but our true friends and helpers.  Let these, with as many more,\nengage in this business for us, and let Mansoul be taken up in much\nbusiness, and let them grow full and rich, and this is the way to get\nground of them.  Remember ye not that thus we prevailed upon Laodicea,\nand how many at present do we hold in this snare?  Now, when they begin\nto grow full, they will forget their misery; and if we shall not affright\nthem, they may happen to fall asleep, and so be got to neglect their town\nwatch, their castle watch, as well as their watch at the gates.\n\n‘Yea, may we not, by this means, so cumber Mansoul with abundance, that\nthey shall be forced to make of their castle a warehouse, instead of a\ngarrison fortified against us, and a receptacle for men of war.  Thus, if\nwe get our goods and commodities thither, I reckon that the castle is\nmore than half ours.  Besides, could we so order it that it shall be\nfilled with such kind of wares, then if we made a sudden assault upon\nthem, it would be hard for the captains to take shelter there.  Do you\nnot know that of the parable, “The deceitfulness of riches choke the\nword”? and again, “When the heart is over-charged with surfeiting and\ndrunkenness, and the cares of this life,” all mischief comes upon them at\nunawares?\n\n‘Furthermore, my lords,’ quoth he, ‘you very well know that it is not\neasy for a people to be filled with our things, and not to have some of\nour Diabolonians as retainers to their houses and services.  Where is a\nMansoulian that is full of this world, that has not for his servants and\nwaiting-men, Mr. Profuse, or Mr. Prodigality, or some other of our\nDiabolonian gang, as Mr. Voluptuous, Mr. Pragmatical, Mr. Ostentation, or\nthe like?  Now these can take the castle of Mansoul, or blow it up, or\nmake it unfit for a garrison for Emmanuel, and any of these will do.\nYea, these, for aught I know, may do it for us sooner than an army of\ntwenty thousand men.  Wherefore, to end as I began, my advice is, that we\nquietly withdraw ourselves, not offering any further force, or forcible\nattempts, upon the castle, at least at this time; and let us set on foot\nour new project, and let us see if that will not make them destroy\nthemselves.’\n\nThis advice was highly applauded by them all, and was accounted the very\nmasterpiece of hell, namely, to choke Mansoul with a fulness of this\nworld, and to surfeit her heart with the good things thereof.  But see\nhow things meet together!  Just as this Diabolonian council was broken\nup, Captain Credence received a letter from Emmanuel, the contents of\nwhich were these: That upon the third day he would meet him in the field\nin the plains about Mansoul.  ‘Meet me in the field!’ quoth the Captain;\n‘what meaneth my lord by this?  I know not what he meaneth by meeting me\nin the field.’  So he took the note in his hand, and did carry it to my\nLord Secretary, to ask his thoughts thereupon; for my Lord was a seer in\nall matters concerning the King, and also for the good and comfort of the\ntown of Mansoul.  So he showed my Lord the note, and desired his opinion\nthereof.  ‘For my part,’ quoth Captain Credence, ‘I know not the meaning\nthereof.’  So my lord did take and read it and, after a little pause, he\nsaid, ‘The Diabolonians have had against Mansoul a great consultation\nto-day; they have, I say, this day been contriving the utter ruin of the\ntown; and the result of their council is, to set Mansoul into such a way\nwhich, if taken, will surely make her destroy herself.  And, to this end,\nthey are making ready for their own departure out of the town, intending\nto betake themselves to the field again,’ and there to lie till they\nshall see whether this their project will take or no.  But be thou ready\nwith the men of thy Lord, (for on the third day they will be in the\nplain,) there to fall upon the Diabolonians; for the Prince will by that\ntime be in the field; yea, by that it is break of day, sun-rising, or\nbefore, and that with a mighty force against them.  So he shall be before\nthem, and thou shalt be behind them, and betwixt you both their army\nshall be destroyed.’\n\nWhen Captain Credence heard this, away goes he to the rest of the\ncaptains, and tells them what a note he had a while since received from\nthe hand of Emmanuel.  ‘And,’ said he, ‘that which was dark therein hath\nmy lord the Lord Secretary expounded unto me.’  He told them, moreover,\nwhat by himself and by them must be done to answer the mind of their\nLord.  Then were the captains glad; and Captain Credence commanded that\nall the King’s trumpeters should ascend to the battlements of the castle,\nand there, in the audience of Diabolus and of the whole town of Mansoul,\nmake the best music that heart could invent.  The trumpeters then did as\nthey were commanded.  They got themselves up to the top of the castle,\nand thus they began to sound.  Then did Diabolus start, and said, ‘What\ncan be the meaning of this? they neither sound Boot-and-saddle, nor\nHorse-and-away, nor a charge.  What do these madmen mean that yet they\nshould be so merry and glad?’  Then answered one of themselves and said,\n‘This is for joy that their Prince Emmanuel is coming to relieve the town\nof Mansoul; and to this end he is at the head of an army, and that this\nrelief is near.’\n\nThe men of Mansoul also were greatly concerned at this melodious charm of\nthe trumpets; they said, yea, they answered one another, saying, ‘This\ncan be no harm to us; surely this can be no harm to us.’  Then said the\nDiabolonians, ‘What had we best to do?’ and it was answered, ‘It was best\nto quit the town;’ and ‘that,’ said one, ‘ye may do in pursuance of your\nlast counsel, and by so doing also be better able to give the enemy\nbattle, should an army from without come upon us.  So, on the second day,\nthey withdrew themselves from Mansoul, and abode in the plains without;\nbut they encamped themselves before Eye-gate, in what terrene and\nterrible manner they could.  The reason why they would not abide in the\ntown (besides the reasons that were debated in their late conclave) was,\nfor that they were not possessed of the stronghold, and ‘because,’ said\nthey, ‘we shall have more convenience to fight, and also to fly, if need\nbe, when we are encamped in the open plains.’  Besides, the town would\nhave been a pit for them rather than a place of defence, had the Prince\ncome up and inclosed them fast therein.  Therefore they betook themselves\nto the field, that they might also be out of the reach of the slings, by\nwhich they were much annoyed all the while that they were in the town.\n\nWell, the time that the captains were to fall upon the Diabolonians being\ncome, they eagerly prepared themselves for action; for Captain Credence\nhad told the captains over night, that they should meet their Prince in\nthe field to-morrow.  This, therefore, made them yet far more desirous to\nbe engaging the enemy; for ‘You shall see the Prince in the field\nto-morrow’ was like oil to a flaming fire, for of a long time they had\nbeen at a distance: they therefore were for this the more earnest and\ndesirous of the work.  So, as I said, the hour being come, Captain\nCredence, with the rest of the men of war, drew out their forces before\nit was day by the sally-port of the town.  And, being all ready, Captain\nCredence went up to the head of the army, and gave to the rest of the\ncaptains the word, and so they to their under-officers and soldiers: the\nword was ‘The sword of the Prince Emmanuel, and the shield of Captain\nCredence;’ which is, in the Mansoulian tongue, ‘The word of God and\nfaith.’  Then the captains fell on, and began roundly to front, and\nflank, and rear Diabolus’s camp.\n\nNow, they left Captain Experience in the town, because he was yet ill of\nhis wounds, which the Diabolonians had given him in the last fight.  But\nwhen he perceived that the captains were at it, what does he but, calling\nfor his crutches with haste, gets up, and away he goes to the battle,\nsaying, ‘Shall I lie here, when my brethren are in the fight, and when\nEmmanuel, the Prince, will show himself in the field to his servants?’\nBut when the enemy saw the man come with his crutches, they were daunted\nyet the more; ‘for,’ thought they, ‘what spirit has possessed these\nMansoulians, that they fight us upon their crutches?’  Well, the\ncaptains, as I said, fell on, and did bravely handle their weapons, still\ncrying out and shouting, as they laid on blows, ‘The sword of the Prince\nEmmanuel, and the shield of Captain Credence!’\n\nNow, when Diabolus saw that the captains were come out, and that so\nvaliantly they surrounded his men, he concluded that, for the present,\nnothing from them was to be looked for but blows, and the dints of their\n‘two-edged sword.’\n\nWherefore he also falls on upon the Prince’s army with all his deadly\nforce: so the battle was joined.  Now who was it that at first Diabolus\nmet with in the fight, but Captain Credence on the one hand, and the Lord\nWillbewill on the other: now Willbewill’s blows were like the blows of a\ngiant, for that man had a strong arm, and he fell in upon the election\ndoubters, for they were the life-guard of Diabolus, and he kept them in\nplay a good while, cutting and battering shrewdly.  Now when Captain\nCredence saw my lord engaged, he did stoutly fall on, on the other hand,\nupon the same company also; so they put them to great disorder.  Now\nCaptain Good-Hope had engaged the vocation doubters, and they were sturdy\nmen; but the captain was a valiant man: Captain Experience did also send\nhim some aid; so he made the vocation doubters to retreat.  The rest of\nthe armies were hotly engaged, and that on every side, and the\nDiabolonians did fight stoutly.  Then did my Lord Secretary command that\nthe slings from the castle should be played; and his men could throw\nstones at an hair’s breadth.  But, after a while, those that were made to\nfly before the captains of the Prince, did begin to rally again, and they\ncame up stoutly upon the rear of the Prince’s army: wherefore the\nPrince’s army began to faint; but, remembering that they should see the\nface of their Prince by-and-by, they took courage, and a very fierce\nbattle was fought.  Then shouted the captains, saying, ‘The sword of the\nPrince Emmanuel, and the shield of Captain Credence!’ and with that\nDiabolus gave back, thinking that more aid had been come.  But no\nEmmanuel as yet appeared.  Moreover, the battle did hang in doubt; and\nthey made a little retreat on both sides.  Now, in the time of respite,\nCaptain Credence bravely encouraged his men to stand to it; and Diabolus\ndid the like, as well as he could.  But Captain Credence made a brave\nspeech to his soldiers, the contents whereof here follow:—\n\n‘Gentlemen soldiers, and my brethren in this design, it rejoiceth me much\nto see in the field for our Prince, this day, so stout and so valiant an\narmy, and such faithful lovers of Mansoul.  You have hitherto, as hath\nbecome you, shown yourselves men of truth and courage against the\nDiabolonian forces; so that, for all their boast, they have not yet much\ncause to boast of their gettings.  Now take to yourselves your wonted\ncourage, and show yourselves men even this once only; for in a few\nminutes after the next engagement, this time, you shall see your Prince\nshow himself in the field; for we must make this second assault upon this\ntyrant Diabolus, and then Emmanuel comes.’\n\nNo sooner had the captain made this speech to his soldiers, but one Mr.\nSpeedy came post to the captain from the Prince, to tell him that\nEmmanuel was at hand.  This news when the captain had received, he\ncommunicated to the other field-officers, and they again to their\nsoldiers and men of war.  Wherefore, like men raised from the dead, so\nthe captains and their men arose, made up to the enemy, and cried as\nbefore, ‘The sword of the Prince Emmanuel, and the shield of Captain\nCredence!’\n\nThe Diabolonians also bestirred themselves, and made resistance as well\nas they could; but in this last engagement the Diabolonians lost their\ncourage, and many of the doubters fell down dead to the ground.  Now,\nwhen they had been in heat of battle about an hour or more, Captain\nCredence lift up his eyes and saw, and, behold, Emmanuel came; and he\ncame with colours flying, trumpets sounding, and the feet of his men\nscarce touched the ground, they hasted with that celerity towards the\ncaptains that were engaged.  Then did Credence wind with his men to the\ntownward, and gave to Diabolus the field: so Emmanuel came upon him on\nthe one side, and the enemies’ place was betwixt them both.  Then again\nthey fell to it afresh; and now it was but a little while more but\nEmmanuel and Captain Credence met, still trampling down the slain as they\ncame.\n\nBut when the captains saw that the Prince was come, and that he fell upon\nthe Diabolonians on the other side, and that Captain Credence and his\nHighness had got them up betwixt them, they shouted, (they so shouted\nthat the ground rent again,) saying, ‘The sword of Emmanuel, and the\nshield of Captain Credence!’  Now, when Diabolus saw that he and his\nforces were so hard beset by the Prince and his princely army, what does\nhe, and the lords of the pit that were with him, but make their escape,\nand forsake their army, and leave them to fall by the hand of Emmanuel,\nand of his noble Captain Credence: so they fell all down slain before\nthem, before the Prince, and before his royal army; there was not left so\nmuch as one doubter alive; they lay spread upon the ground dead men, as\none would spread dung upon the land.\n\nWhen the battle was over, all things came into order in the camp.  Then\nthe captains and elders of Mansoul came together to salute Emmanuel,\nwhile without the corporation: so they saluted him, and welcomed him, and\nthat with a thousand welcomes, for that he was come to the borders of\nMansoul again.  So he smiled upon them, and said, ‘Peace be to you.’\nThen they addressed themselves to go to the town; they went then to go up\nto Mansoul, they, the Prince, with all the new forces that now he had\nbrought with him to the war.  Also all the gates of the town were set\nopen for his reception, so glad were they of his blessed return.  And\nthis was the manner and order of this going of his into Mansoul:\n\nFirst.  As I said, all the gates of the town were set open, yea, the\ngates of the castle also; the elders, too, of the town of Mansoul placed\nthemselves at the gates of the town, to salute him at his entrance\nthither: and so they did; for, as he drew near, and approached towards\nthe gates, they said, ‘Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up,\nye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.’  And they\nanswered again, ‘Who is the King of glory?’ and they made return to\nthemselves, ‘The Lord, strong and mighty; the Lord mighty in battle.\nLift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors,’\netc.\n\nSecondly.  It was ordered also, by those of Mansoul, that all the way\nfrom the town gates to those of the castle, his blessed Majesty should be\nentertained with the song, by them that had the best skill in music in\nall the town of Mansoul: then did the elders, and the rest of the men of\nMansoul, answer one another as Emmanuel entered the town, till he came at\nthe castle gates, with songs and sound of trumpets, saying, ‘They have\nseen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the\nsanctuary.  So the singers went before, the players on instruments\nfollowed after, and among them were the damsels playing on timbrels.’\n\nThirdly.  Then the captains, (for I would speak a word of them,) they in\ntheir order waited on the Prince, as he entered into the gates of\nMansoul.  Captain Credence went before, and Captain Good-Hope with him;\nCaptain Charity came behind with other of his companions, and Captain\nPatience followed after all; and the rest of the captains, some on the\nright hand, and some on the left, accompanied Emmanuel into Mansoul.  And\nall the while the colours were displayed, the trumpets sounded, and\ncontinual shoutings were among the soldiers.  The Prince himself rode\ninto the town in his armour, which was all of beaten gold, and in his\nchariot—the pillars of it were of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the\ncovering of it was of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love for\nthe daughters of the town of Mansoul.\n\nFourthly.  When the Prince was come to the entrance of Mansoul, he found\nall the streets strewed with lilies and flowers, curiously decked with\nboughs and branches from the green trees that stood round about the town.\nEvery door also was filled with persons, who had adorned every one their\nfore-part against their house with something of variety and singular\nexcellency, to entertain him withal as he passed in the streets: they\nalso themselves, as Emmanuel passed by, did welcome him with shouts and\nacclamations of joy, saying, ‘Blessed be the Prince that cometh in the\nname of his Father Shaddai.’\n\nFifthly.  At the castle gates the elders of Mansoul, namely, the Lord\nMayor, the Lord Willbewill, the subordinate preacher, Mr. Knowledge, and\nMr. Mind, with other of the gentry of the place, saluted Emmanuel again.\nThey bowed before him, they kissed the dust of his feet, they thanked,\nthey blessed, and praised his Highness for not taking advantage against\nthem for their sins, but rather had pity upon them in their misery, and\nreturned to them with mercies, and to build up their Mansoul for ever.\nThus was he had up straightway to the castle; for that was the royal\npalace, and the place where his honour was to dwell; the which was ready\nprepared for his Highness by the presence of the Lord Secretary, and the\nwork of Captain Credence.  So he entered in.\n\nSixthly.  Then the people and commonalty of the town of Mansoul came to\nhim into the castle to mourn, and to weep, and to lament for their\nwickedness, by which they had forced him out of the town.  So when they\nwere come, bowed themselves to the ground seven times; they also wept,\nthey wept aloud, and asked forgiveness of the Prince, and prayed that he\nwould again, as of old, confirm his love to Mansoul.\n\nTo the which the great Prince replied, ‘Weep not, but go your way, eat\nthe fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to them for whom nought\nis prepared; for the joy of your Lord is your strength.  I am returned to\nMansoul with mercies, and my name shall be set up, exalted, and magnified\nby it.’  He also took these inhabitants, and kissed them, and laid them\nin his bosom.\n\nMoreover, he gave to the elders of Mansoul, and to each town officer, a\nchain of gold and a signet.  He also sent to their wives earrings and\njewels, and bracelets, and other things.  He also bestowed upon the\ntrue-born children of Mansoul many precious things.\n\nWhen Emmanuel, the Prince, had done all these things for the famous town\nof Mansoul, then he said unto them, first, ‘Wash your garments, then put\non your ornaments, and then come to me into the castle of Mansoul.’  So\nthey went to the fountain that was set open for Judah and Jerusalem to\nwash in; and there they washed, and there they made their ‘garments\nwhite,’ and came again to the Prince into the castle, and thus they stood\nbefore him.\n\nAnd now there was music and dancing throughout the whole town of Mansoul,\nand that because their Prince had again granted to them his presence and\nthe light of his countenance; the bells also did ring, and the sun shone\ncomfortably upon them for a great while together.\n\nThe town of Mansoul did also now more thoroughly seek the destruction and\nruin of all remaining Diabolonians that abode in the walls, and the dens\nthat they had in the town of Mansoul; for there was of them that had, to\nthis day, escaped with life and limb from the hand of their suppressors\nin the famous town of Mansoul.\n\nBut my Lord Willbewill was a greater terror to them now than ever he had\nbeen before; forasmuch as his heart was yet more fully bent to seek,\ncontrive, and pursue them to the death; he pursued them night and day,\nand did put them now to sore distress, as will afterwards appear.\n\nAfter things were thus far put into order in the famous town of Mansoul,\ncare was taken, and order given by the blessed Prince Emmanuel, that the\ntownsmen should, without further delay, appoint some to go forth into the\nplain to bury the dead that were there,—the dead that fell by the sword\nof Emmanuel, and by the shield of the Captain Credence,—lest the fumes\nand ill savours that would arise from them might infect the air, and so\nannoy the famous town of Mansoul.  This also was a reason of this order,\nnamely, that, as much as in Mansoul lay, they might cut off the name, and\nbeing, and remembrance of those enemies from the thought of the famous\ntown of Mansoul and its inhabitants.\n\nSo order was given out by the Lord Mayor, that wise and trusty friend of\nthe town of Mansoul, that persons should be employed about this necessary\nbusiness; and Mr. Godly-Fear, and one Mr. Upright, were to be overseers\nabout this matter: so persons were put under them to work in the fields,\nand to bury the slain that lay dead in the plains.  And these were their\nplaces of employment: some were to make the graves, some to bury the\ndead, and some were to go to and fro in the plains, and also round about\nthe borders of Mansoul, to see if a skull, or a bone, or a piece of a\nbone of a doubter, was yet to be found above ground anywhere near the\ncorporation; and if any were found, it was ordered, that the searchers\nthat searched should set up a mark thereby, and a sign, that those that\nwere appointed to bury them might find it, and bury it out of sight, that\nthe name and remembrance of a Diabolonian doubter might be blotted out\nfrom under heaven; and that the children, and they that were to be born\nin Mansoul, might not know, if possible, what a skull, what a bone, or a\npiece of a bone of a doubter was.  So the buriers, and those that were\nappointed for that purpose, did as they were commanded: they buried the\ndoubters, and all the skulls and bones, and pieces of bones of doubters,\nwherever they found them; and so they cleansed the plains.  Now also Mr.\nGod’s-Peace took up his commission, and acted again as in former days.\n\nThus they buried in the plains about Mansoul the election doubters, the\nvocation doubters, the grace doubters, the perseverance doubters, the\nresurrection doubters, the salvation doubters, and the glory doubters;\nwhose captains were Captain Rage, Captain Cruel, Captain Damnation,\nCaptain Insatiable, Captain Brimstone, Captain Torment, Captain No-Ease,\nCaptain Sepulchre, and Captain Past-Hope; and old Incredulity was, under\nDiabolus, their general.  There were also the seven heads of their army;\nand they were the Lord Beelzebub, the Lord Lucifer, the Lord Legion, the\nLord Apollyon, the Lord Python, the Lord Cerberus, and the Lord Belial.\nBut the princes and the captains, with old Incredulity, their general,\ndid all of them make their escape: so their men fell down slain by the\npower of the Prince’s forces, and by the hands of the men of the town of\nMansoul.  They also were buried as is afore related, to the exceeding\ngreat joy of the now famous town of Mansoul.  They that buried them\nburied also with them their arms, which were cruel instruments of death:\n(their weapons were arrows, darts, mauls, firebrands, and the like).\nThey buried also their armour, their colours, banners, with the standard\nof Diabolus, and what else soever they could find that did but smell of a\nDiabolonian doubter.\n\nNow when the tyrant had arrived at Hell-Gate Hill, with his old friend\nIncredulity, they immediately descended the den, and having there with\ntheir fellows for a while condoled their misfortune and great loss that\nthey sustained against the town of Mansoul, they fell at length into a\npassion, and revenged they would be for the loss that they sustained\nbefore the town of Mansoul.  Wherefore they presently call a council to\ncontrive yet further what was to be done against the famous town of\nMansoul; for their yawning paunches could not wait to see the result of\ntheir Lord Lucifer’s and their Lord Apollyon’s counsel that they had\ngiven before; for their raging gorge thought every day, even as long as a\nshort for ever, until they were filled with the body and soul, with the\nflesh and bones, and with all the delicates of Mansoul.  They therefore\nresolve to make another attempt upon the town of Mansoul, and that by an\narmy mixed and made up partly of doubters, and partly of blood-men.  A\nmore particular account now take of both.\n\nThe doubters are such as have their name from their nature, as well as\nfrom the land and kingdom where they are born: their nature is to put a\nquestion upon every one of the truths of Emmanuel; and their country is\ncalled the land of Doubting, and that land lieth off, and farthest remote\nto the north, between the land of Darkness and that called the ‘valley of\nthe shadow of death.’  For though the land of Darkness, and that called\n‘the valley of the shadow of death,’ be sometimes called as if they were\none and the self-same place, yet indeed they are two, lying but a little\nway asunder, and the land of Doubting points in, and lieth between them.\nThis is the land of Doubting; and these that came with Diabolus to ruin\nthe town of Mansoul are the natives of that country.\n\nThe blood-men are a people that have their name derived from the\nmalignity of their nature, and from the fury that is in them to execute\nit upon the town of Mansoul: their land lieth under the dog-star, and by\nthat they are governed as to their intellectuals.  The name of their\ncountry is the province of Loath-good: the remote parts of it are far\ndistant from the land of Doubting, yet they do both butt and bound upon\nthe hill called Hell-Gate Hill.  These people are always in league with\nthe doubters, for they jointly do make question of the faith and fidelity\nof the men of the town of Mansoul, and so are both alike qualified for\nthe service of their prince.\n\nNow of these two countries did Diabolus, by the beating of his drum,\nraise another army against the town of Mansoul, of five-and-twenty\nthousand strong.  There were ten thousand doubters, and fifteen thousand\nblood-men, and they were put under several captains for the war; and old\nIncredulity was again made general of the army.\n\nAs for the doubters, their captains were five of the seven that were\nheads of the last Diabolonian army, and these are their names: Captain\nBeelzebub, Captain Lucifer, Captain Apollyon, Captain Legion, and Captain\nCerberus; and the captains that they had before were some of them made\nlieutenants, and some ensigns of the army.\n\nBut Diabolus did not count that, in this expedition of his, these\ndoubters would prove his principal men, for their manhood had been tried\nbefore; also the Mansoulians had put them to the worst: only he did bring\nthem to multiply a number, and to help, if need was, at a pinch.  But his\ntrust he put in his blood-men, for that they were all rugged villains,\nand he knew that they had done feats heretofore.\n\nAs for the blood-men, they also were under command and the names of their\ncaptains were, Captain Cain, Captain Nimrod, Captain Ishmael, Captain\nEsau, Captain Saul, Captain Absalom, Captain Judas, and Captain Pope.\n\n1. Captain Cain was over two bands, namely, the zealous and the angry\nblood-men: his standard-bearer bare the red colours, and his scutcheon\nwas the murdering club.\n\n2. Captain Nimrod was captain over two bands, namely, the tyrannical and\nencroaching blood-men: his standard-bearer bare the red colours, and his\nscutcheon was the great bloodhound.\n\n3. Captain Ishmael was captain over two bands, namely, the mocking and\nscorning blood-men: his standard-bearer bare the red colours, and his\nscutcheon was one mocking at Abraham’s Isaac.\n\n4. Captain Esau was captain over two bands, namely, the blood-men that\ngrudged that another should have the blessing; also over the blood-men\nthat are for executing their private revenge upon others: his\nstandard-bearer bare the red colours, and his scutcheon was one privately\nlurking to murder Jacob.\n\n5. Captain Saul was captain over two bands, namely, the groundlessly\njealous and the devilishly furious blood-men: his standard-bearer bare\nthe red colours, and his scutcheon was three bloody darts cast at\nharmless David.\n\n6. Captain Absalom was captain over two bands, namely, over the blood-men\nthat will kill a father or a friend for the glory of this world; also\nover those blood-men that will hold one fair in hand with words, till\nthey shall have pierced him with their swords: his standard-bearer did\nbear the red colours, and his scutcheon was the son pursuing the father’s\nblood.\n\n7. Captain Judas was over two bands, namely, the blood-men that will sell\na man’s life for money, and those also that will betray their friend with\na kiss: his standard-bearer bare the red colours, and his scutcheon was\nthirty pieces of silver and the halter.\n\n8. Captain Pope was captain over one band, for all these spirits are\njoined in one under him: his standard-bearer bare the red colours, and\nhis scutcheon was the stake, the flame, and the good man in it.\n\nNow, the reason why Diabolus did so soon rally another force, after he\nhad been beaten out of the field, was, for that he put mighty confidence\nin this army of blood-men; for he put a great deal of more trust in them\nthan he did before in his army of doubters; though they had also often\ndone great service for him in the strengthening of him in his kingdom.\nBut these blood-men, he had proved them often, and their sword did seldom\nreturn empty.  Besides, he knew that these, like mastiffs, would fasten\nupon any; upon father, mother, brother, sister, prince, or governor, yea\nupon the Prince of princes.  And that which encouraged him the more was,\nfor that they once did force Emmanuel out of the kingdom of Universe;\n‘And why,’ thought he, ‘may they not also drive him from the town of\nMansoul?’\n\nSo this army of five-and-twenty thousand strong was, by their general,\nthe great Lord Incredulity, led up against the town of Mansoul.  Now Mr.\nPrywell, the scoutmaster-general, did himself go out to spy, and he did\nbring Mansoul tidings of their coming.  Wherefore they shut up their\ngates, and put themselves in a posture of defence against these new\nDiabolonians that came up against the town.\n\nSo Diabolus brought up his army, and beleaguered the town of Mansoul; the\ndoubters were placed about Feel-gate, and the blood-men set down before\nEye-gate and Ear-gate.\n\nNow when this army had thus encamped themselves, Incredulity did, in the\nname of Diabolus, his own name, and in the name of the blood-men and the\nrest that were with him, send a summons as hot as a red-hot iron to\nMansoul, to yield to their demands; threatening, that if they still stood\nit out against them, they would presently burn down Mansoul with fire.\nFor you must know that, as for the blood-men, they were not so much that\nMansoul should be surrendered, as that Mansoul should be destroyed, and\ncut off out of the land of the living.  True, they send to them to\nsurrender; but should they so do, that would not stench or quench the\nthirsts of these men.  They must have blood, the blood of Mansoul, else\nthey die; and it is from hence that they have their name.  Wherefore\nthese blood-men he reserved while now that they might, when all his\nengines proved ineffectual, as his last and sure card be played against\nthe town of Mansoul.\n\nNow, when the townsmen had received this red-hot summons, it begat in\nthem at present some changing and interchanging thoughts; but they\njointly agreed, in less than half an hour, to carry the summons to the\nPrince, the which they did when they had writ at the bottom of it, ‘Lord,\nsave Mansoul from bloody men!’\n\nSo he took it, and looked upon it, and considered it, and took notice\nalso of that short petition that the men of Mansoul had written at the\nbottom of it, and called to him the noble Captain Credence, and bid him\ngo and take Captain Patience with him, and go and take care of that side\nof Mansoul that was beleaguered by the blood-men.  So they went and did\nas they were commanded: the Captain Credence went and took Captain\nPatience, and they both secured that side of Mansoul that was besieged by\nthe blood-men.\n\nThen he commanded that Captain Good-hope and Captain Charity, and my Lord\nWillbewill, should take charge of the other side of the town.  ‘And I,’\nsaid the Prince, ‘will set my standard upon the battlements of your\ncastle, and do you three watch against the doubters.’  This done, he\nagain commanded that the brave captain, the Captain Experience, should\ndraw up his men in the market-place, and that there he should exercise\nthem day by day before the people of the town of Mansoul.  Now this siege\nwas long, and many a fierce attempt did the enemy, especially those\ncalled the blood-men, make upon the town of Mansoul; and many a shrewd\nbrush did some of the townsmen meet with from them, especially Captain\nSelf-Denial, who, I should have told you before, was commanded to take\nthe care of Ear-gate and Eye-gate now against the blood-men.  This\nCaptain Self-Denial was a young man, but stout, and a townsman in\nMansoul, as Captain Experience also was.  And Emmanuel, at his second\nreturn to Mansoul, made him a captain over a thousand of the Mansoulians,\nfor the good of the corporation.  This captain, therefore, being an hardy\nman, and a man of great courage, and willing to venture himself for the\ngood of the town of Mansoul, would now and then sally out upon the\nblood-men, and give them many notable alarms, and entered several brisk\nskirmishes with them, and also did some execution upon them; but you must\nthink that this could not easily be done, but he must meet with brushes\nhimself, for he carried several of their marks in his face; yea, and some\nin some other parts of his body.\n\nSo, after some time spent for the trial of the faith, and hope, and love\nof the town of Mansoul, the Prince Emmanuel upon a day calls his captains\nand men of war together, and divides them into two companies; this done,\nhe commands them at a time appointed, and that in the morning very early,\nto sally out upon the enemy, saying: ‘Let half of you fall upon the\ndoubters, and half of you fall upon the blood-men.  Those of you that go\nout against the doubters, kill and slay, and cause to perish so many of\nthem as by any means you can lay hands on; but for you that go out\nagainst the blood-men, slay them not, but take them alive.’\n\nSo, at the time appointed, betimes in the morning, the captains went out\nas they were commanded, against the enemies.  Captain Good-Hope, Captain\nCharity, and those that were joined with them, as Captain Innocent and\nCaptain Experience, went out against the doubters; and Captain Credence,\nand Captain Patience, with Captain Self-Denial, and the rest that were to\njoin with them, went out against the blood-men.\n\nNow, those that went out against the doubters drew up into a body before\nthe plain, and marched on to bid them battle.  But the doubters,\nremembering their last success, made a retreat, not daring to stand the\nshock, but fled from the Prince’s men; wherefore they pursued them, and\nin their pursuit slew many, but they could not catch them all.  Now those\nthat escaped went some of them home; and the rest by fives, nines, and\nseventeens, like wanderers, went straggling up and down the country,\nwhere they upon the barbarous people showed and exercised many of their\nDiabolonian actions: nor did these people rise up in arms against them,\nbut suffered themselves to be enslaved by them.  They would also after\nthis show themselves in companies before the town of Mansoul, but never\nto abide in it; for if Captain Credence, Captain Good-Hope, or Captain\nExperience did but show themselves, they fled.\n\nThose that went out against the blood-men did as they were commanded:\nthey forbore to slay any, but sought to compass them about.  But the\nblood-men, when they saw that no Emmanuel was in the field, concluded\nalso that no Emmanuel was in Mansoul; wherefore they, looking upon what\nthe captains did to be, as they called it, a fruit of the extravagancy of\ntheir wild and foolish fancies, rather despised them than feared them.\nBut the captains, minding their business, at last did compass them round;\nthey also that had routed the doubters came in amain to their aid: so, in\nfine, after some little struggling, (for the blood-men also would have\nrun for it, only now it was too late; for though they are mischievous and\ncruel, where they can overcome, yet all blood-men are chicken-hearted\nmen, when they once come to see themselves matched and equalled,)—so the\ncaptains took them, and brought them to the Prince.\n\nNow when they were taken, had before the Prince, and examined, he found\nthem to be of three several counties, though they all came out of one\nland.\n\n1. One sort of them came out of Blind-man-shire, and they were such as\ndid ignorantly what they did.\n\n2. Another sort of them came out of Blind-zeal-shire, and they did\nsuperstitiously what they did.\n\n3. The third sort of them came out of the town of Malice, in the county\nof Envy, and they did what they did out of spite and implacableness.\n\nFor the first of these, namely, they that came out of Blind-man-shire,\nwhen they saw where they were, and against whom they had fought, they\ntrembled and cried, as they stood before him; and as many of these as\nasked him mercy, he touched their lips with his golden sceptre.\n\nThey that came out of Blind-zeal-shire, they did not as their fellows\ndid; for they pleaded that they had a right to do what they did, because\nMansoul was a town whose laws and customs were diverse from all that\ndwelt thereabouts.  Very few of these could be brought to see their evil;\nbut those that did, and asked mercy, they also obtained favour.\n\nNow, they that came out of the town of Malice, that is in the county of\nEnvy, they neither wept, nor disputed, nor repented, but stood gnawing\ntheir tongues before him for anguish and madness, because they could not\nhave their will upon Mansoul.  Now these last, with all those of the\nother two sorts that did not unfeignedly ask pardon for their\nfaults,—those he made to enter into sufficient bond to answer for what\nthey had done against Mansoul, and against her King, at the great and\ngeneral assizes to be holden for our Lord the King, where he himself\nshould appoint for the country and kingdom of Universe.  So they became\nbound each man for himself, to come in, when called upon, to answer\nbefore our Lord the King for what they had done as before.\n\nAnd thus much concerning this second army that was sent by Diabolus to\noverthrow Mansoul.\n\nBut there were three of those that came from the land of Doubting, who,\nafter they had wandered and ranged the country a while, and perceived\nthat they had escaped, were so hardy as to thrust themselves, knowing\nthat yet there were in the town Diabolonians,—I say, they were so hardy\nas to thrust themselves into Mansoul among them.  (Three, did I say?  I\nthink there were four.)  Now, to whose house should these Diabolonian\ndoubters go, but to the house of an old Diabolonian in Mansoul, whose\nname was Evil-Questioning, a very great enemy he was to Mansoul, and a\ngreat doer among the Diabolonians there.  Well, to this\nEvil-Questioning’s house, as was said, did these Diabolonians come (you\nmay be sure that they had directions how to find the way thither), so he\nmade them welcome, pitied their misfortune, and succoured them with the\nbest that he had in his house.  Now, after a little acquaintance (and it\nwas not long before they had that), this old Evil-Questioning asked the\ndoubters if they were all of a town (he knew that they were all of one\nkingdom), and they answered: ‘No, nor not of one shire neither; for I,’\nsaid one, ‘am an election doubter:’  ‘I,’ said another, ‘am a vocation\ndoubter:’ then said the third, ‘I am a salvation doubter:’ and the fourth\nsaid he was a grace doubter.  ‘Well,’ quoth the old gentleman, ‘be of\nwhat shire you will, I am persuaded that you are down, boys: you have the\nvery length of my foot, are one with my heart, and shall be welcome to\nme.’  So they thanked him, and were glad that they had found themselves\nan harbour in Mansoul.\n\nThen said Evil-Questioning to them: ‘How many of your company might there\nbe that came with you to the siege of Mansoul?’ and they answered: ‘There\nwere but ten thousand doubters in all, for the rest of the army consisted\nof fifteen thousand blood-men.  These blood-men,’ quoth they, ‘border\nupon our country; but, poor men! as we hear, they were every one taken by\nEmmanuel’s forces.’  ‘Ten thousand!’ quoth the old gentleman; ‘I will\npromise you, that is a round company.  But how came it to pass, since you\nwere so mighty a number, that you fainted, and durst not fight your\nfoes?’  ‘Our general,’ said they, ‘was the first man that did run for\nit.’  ‘Pray,’ quoth their landlord, ‘who was that, your cowardly\ngeneral?’  ‘He was once the Lord Mayor of Mansoul,’ said they: ‘but pray\ncall him not a cowardly general; for whether any from the east to the\nwest has done more service for our prince Diabolus, than has my Lord\nIncredulity, will be a hard question for you to answer.  But had they\ncatched him, they would for certain have hanged him; and we promise you,\nhanging is but a bad business.’  Then said the old gentleman, ‘I would\nthat all the ten thousand doubters were now well armed in Mansoul, and\nmyself at the head of them; I would see what I could do.’  ‘Ay,’ said\nthey, ‘that would be well if we could see that; but wishes, alas! what\nare they?’ and these words were spoken aloud.  ‘Well,’ said old\nEvil-Questioning, ‘take heed that you talk not too loud; you must be quat\nand close, and must take care of yourselves while you are here, or, I\nwill assure you, you will be snapped.’  ‘Why?’ quoth the doubters.\n‘Why!’ quoth the old gentleman; ‘why! because both the Prince and Lord\nSecretary, and their captains and soldiers, are all at present in town;\nyea, the town is as full of them as ever it can hold.  And besides, there\nis one whose name is Willbewill, a most cruel enemy of ours, and him the\nPrince has made keeper of the gates, and has commanded him that, with all\nthe diligence he can, he should look for, search out, and destroy all,\nand all manner of Diabolonians.  And if he lighteth upon you, down you\ngo, though your heads were made of gold.’\n\nAnd now, to see how it happened, one of the Lord Willbewill’s faithful\nsoldiers, whose name was Mr. Diligence, stood all this while listening\nunder old Evil-Questioning’s eaves, and heard all the talk that had been\nbetwixt him and the doubters that he entertained under his roof.\n\nThe soldier was a man that my lord had much confidence in, and that he\nloved dearly; and that both because he was a man of courage, and also a\nman that was unwearied in seeking after Diabolonians to apprehend them.\n\nNow this man, as I told you, heard all the talk that was between old\nEvil-Questioning and these Diabolonians; wherefore what does he but goes\nto his lord, and tells him what he had heard.  ‘And sayest thou so, my\ntrusty?’ quoth my lord.  ‘Ay,’ quoth Diligence, ‘that I do; and if your\nlordship will be pleased to go with me, you shall find it as I have\nsaid.’  ‘And are they there?’ quoth my lord.  ‘I know Evil-Questioning\nwell, for he and I were great in the time of our apostasy: but I know not\nnow where he dwells.’  ‘But I do,’ said his man, ‘and if your lordship\nwill go, I will lead you the way to his den.’  ‘Go!’ quoth my lord, ‘that\nI will.  Come, my Diligence, let us go find them out.’\n\nSo my lord and his man went together the direct way to his house.  Now\nhis man went before to show him his way, and they went till they came\neven under old Mr. Evil-Questioning’s wall.  Then said Diligence, ‘Hark!\nmy lord, do you know the old gentleman’s tongue when you hear it?’\n‘Yes,’ said my lord, ‘I know it well, but I have not seen him many a day.\nThis I know, he is cunning; I wish he doth not give us the slip.’  ‘Let\nme alone for that,’ said his servant Diligence.  ‘But how shall we find\nthe door?’ quoth my lord.  ‘Let me alone for that, too,’ said his man.\nSo he had my Lord Willbewill about, and showed him the way to the door.\nThen my lord, without more ado, broke open the door, rushed into the\nhouse, and caught them all five together, even as Diligence his man had\ntold him.  So my lord apprehended them, and led them away, and committed\nthem to the hand of Mr. Trueman, the gaoler, and commanded, and he did\nput them in ward.  This done, my Lord Mayor was acquainted in the morning\nwith what my Lord Willbewill had done over night, and his lordship\nrejoiced much at the news, not only because there were doubters\napprehended, but because that old Evil-Questioning was taken; for he had\nbeen a very great trouble to Mansoul, and much affliction to my Lord\nMayor himself.  He had also been sought for often, but no hand could ever\nbe laid upon him till now.\n\nWell, the next thing was to make preparation to try these five that by my\nlord had been apprehended, and that were in the hands of Mr. Trueman, the\ngaoler.  So the day was set, and the court called and come together, and\nthe prisoners brought to the bar.  My Lord Willbewill had power to have\nslain them when at first he took them, and that without any more ado; but\nhe thought it at this time more for the honour of the Prince, the comfort\nof Mansoul, and the discouragement of the enemy, to bring them forth to\npublic judgment.\n\nBut, I say, Mr. Trueman brought them in chains to the bar; to the\ntown-hall, for that was the place of judgment.  So, to be short, the jury\nwas panelled, the witnesses sworn, and the prisoners tried for their\nlives: the jury was the same that tried Mr. No-Truth, Pitiless, Haughty,\nand the rest of their companions.\n\nAnd, first, old Questioning himself was set to the bar for he was the\nreceiver, the entertainer, and comforter of these doubters, that by\nnation were outlandish men: then he was bid to hearken to his charge, and\nwas told that he had liberty to object, if he had ought to say for\nhimself.  So his indictment was read: the manner and form here follows.\n\n‘Mr. Questioning, Thou art here indicted by the name of Evil-Questioning,\nan intruder upon the town of Mansoul, for that thou art a Diabolonian by\nnature, and also a hater of the Prince Emmanuel, and one that hast\nstudied the ruin of the town of Mansoul.  Thou art also here indicted for\ncountenancing the King’s enemies, after wholesome laws made to the\ncontrary: for, 1. Thou hast questioned the truth of her doctrine and\nstate: 2. In wishing that ten thousand doubters were in her: 3. In\nreceiving, in entertaining, and encouraging of her enemies, that came\nfrom their army unto thee.  What sayest thou to this indictment? art thou\nguilty or not guilty?’\n\n‘My lord,’ quoth he, ‘I know not the meaning of this indictment,\nforasmuch as I am not the man concerned in it; the man that standeth by\nthis charge accused before this bench is called by the name of\nEvil-Questioning, which name I deny to be mine, mine being\nHonest-Inquiry.  The one indeed sounds like the other; but, I trow, your\nlordships know that between these two there is a wide difference; for I\nhope that a man, even in the worst of times, and that, too, amongst the\nworst of men, may make an honest inquiry after things, without running\nthe danger of death.’\n\nThen spake my Lord Willbewill, for he was one of the witnesses: ‘My lord,\nand you the honourable bench and magistrates of the town of Mansoul, you\nall have heard with your ears that the prisoner at the bar has denied his\nname, and so thinks to shift from the charge of the indictment.  But I\nknow him to be the man concerned, and that his proper name is\nEvil-Questioning.  I have known him, my lord, above these thirty years,\nfor he and I (a shame it is for me to speak it) were great acquaintance,\nwhen Diabolus, that tyrant, had the government of Mansoul; and I testify\nthat he is a Diabolonian by nature, an enemy to our Prince, and a hater\nof the blessed town of Mansoul.  He has, in times of rebellion, been at\nand lain in my house, my lord, not so little as twenty nights together,\nand we did use to talk then, for the substance of talk, as he and his\ndoubters have talked of late: true, I have not seen him many a day.  I\nsuppose that the coming of Emmanuel to Mansoul has made him change his\nlodgings, as this indictment has driven him to change his name; but this\nis the man, my lord.’\n\nThen said the court unto him, ‘Hast thou any more to say?’\n\n‘Yes,’ quoth the old gentleman, ‘that I have; for all that as yet has\nbeen said against me, is but by the mouth of one witness; and it is not\nlawful for the famous town of Mansoul, at the mouth of one witness, to\nput any man to death.’\n\nThen stood forth Mr. Diligence, and said, ‘My lord, as I was upon my\nwatch such a night at the head of Bad Street, in this town, I chanced to\nhear a muttering within this gentleman’s house.  Then, thought I, what is\nto do here?  So I went up close, but very softly, to the side of the\nhouse to listen, thinking, as indeed it fell out, that there I might\nlight upon some Diabolonian conventicle.  So, as I said, I drew nearer\nand nearer; and when I was got up close to the wall, it was but a while\nbefore I perceived that there were outlandish men in the house; but I did\nwell understand their speech, for I have been a traveller myself.  Now,\nhearing such language in such a tottering cottage as this old gentleman\ndwelt in, I clapped mine ear to a hole in the window, and there heard\nthem talk as followeth.  This old Mr. Questioning asked these doubters\nwhat they were, whence they came, and what was their business in these\nparts; and they told him to all these questions, yet he did entertain\nthem.  He also asked what numbers there were of them; and they told him\nten thousand men.  He then asked them, why they made no more manly\nassault upon Mansoul; and they told him: so he called their general\ncoward, for marching off when he should have fought for his prince.\nFurther, this old Evil-Questioning wished, and I heard him wish, would\nall the ten thousand doubters were now in Mansoul, and himself at the\nhead of them.  He bid them also to take heed and lie quat; for if they\nwere taken they must die, although they had heads of gold.’  Then said\nthe court: ‘Mr. Evil-Questioning, here is now another witness against\nyou, and his testimony is full: 1. He swears that you did receive these\nmen into your house, and that you did nourish them there, though you knew\nthat they were Diabolonians, and the King’s enemies.  2. He swears that\nyou did wish ten thousand of them in Mansoul.  3. He swears that you did\ngive them advice to be quat and close, lest they were taken by the King’s\nservants.  All which manifesteth that thou art a Diabolonian; but hadst\nthou been a friend to the King, thou wouldst have apprehended them.’\n\nThen said Evil-Questioning: ‘To the first of these I answer, The men that\ncame into mine house were strangers, and I took them in; and is it now\nbecome a crime in Mansoul for a man to entertain strangers?  That I did\nalso nourish them is true; and why should my charity be blamed?  As for\nthe reason why I wished ten thousand of them in Mansoul, I never told it\nto the witnesses, nor to themselves.  I might wish them to be taken, and\nso my wish might mean well to Mansoul, for aught that any yet knows.  I\ndid also bid them take heed that they fell not into the captains’ hands;\nbut that might be because I am unwilling that any man should be slain,\nand not because I would have the King’s enemies as such escape.’\n\nMy Lord Mayor then replied: ‘That though it was a virtue to entertain\nstrangers, yet it was treason to entertain the King’s enemies.  And for\nwhat else thou hast said, thou dost by words but labour to evade and\ndefer the execution of judgment.  But could there be no more proved\nagainst thee but that thou art a Diabolonian, thou must for that die the\ndeath by the law; but to be a receiver, a nourisher, a countenancer, and\na harbourer of others of them, yea, of outlandish Diabolonians, yea, of\nthem that came from far on purpose to cut off and destroy our\nMansoul—this must not be borne.’\n\nThen said Evil-Questioning: ‘I see how the game will go: I must die for\nmy name, and for my charity.’  And so he held his peace.\n\nThen they called the outlandish doubters to the bar, and the first of\nthem that was arraigned was the election doubter.  So his indictment was\nread; and because he was an outlandish man, the substance of it was told\nhim by an interpreter; namely, ‘That he was there charged with being an\nenemy of Emmanuel the Prince, a hater of the town of Mansoul, and an\nopposer of her most wholesome doctrine.’\n\nThen the judge asked him if he would plead? but he said only this—That he\nconfessed that he was an election doubter, and that that was the religion\nthat he had ever been brought up in.  And said, moreover, ‘If I must die\nfor my religion, I trow, I shall die a martyr, and so I care the less.’\n\n_Judge_.  Then it was replied: ‘To question election, is to overthrow a\ngreat doctrine of the gospel, namely, the omnisciency, and power, and\nwill of God; to take away the liberty of God with his creature, to\nstumble the faith of the town of Mansoul, and to make salvation to depend\nupon works, and not upon grace.  It also belied the word, and disquieted\nthe minds of the men of Mansoul; therefore by the best of laws he must\ndie.’\n\nThen was the vocation doubter called, and set to the bar; and his\nindictment for substance was the same with the other, only he was\nparticularly charged with denying the calling of Mansoul.\n\nThe judge asked him also what he had to say for himself?\n\nSo he replied: ‘That he never believed that there was any such thing as a\ndistinct and powerful call of God to Mansoul; otherwise than by the\ngeneral voice of the word, nor by that neither, otherwise than as it\nexhorted them to forbear evil, and to do that which is good, and in so\ndoing a promise of happiness is annexed.’\n\nThen said the judge: ‘Thou art a Diabolonian, and hast denied a great\npart of one of the most experimental truths of the Prince of the town of\nMansoul; for he has called, and she has heard a most distinct and\npowerful call of her Emmanuel, by which she has been quickened, awakened,\nand possessed with heavenly grace to desire to have communion with her\nPrince, to serve him, and to do his will, and to look for her happiness\nmerely of his good pleasure.  And for thine abhorrence of this good\ndoctrine, thou must die the death.’\n\nThen the grace doubter was called, and his indictment was read and he\nreplied thereto: ‘That though he was of the land of doubting, his father\nwas the offspring of a Pharisee, and lived in good fashion among his\nneighbours, and that he taught him to believe, and believe it I do, and\nwill, that Mansoul shall never be saved freely by grace.’\n\nThen said the judge: ‘Why, the law of the Prince is plain: 1. Negatively,\n“not of works:” 2. Positively, “by grace you are saved.”  And thy\nreligion settleth in and upon the works of the flesh; for the works of\nthe law are the works of the flesh.  Besides, in saying as thou hast\ndone, thou hast robbed God of His glory, and given it to a sinful man;\nthou hast robbed Christ of the necessity of His undertaking, and the\nsufficiency thereof, and hast given both these to the works of the flesh.\nThou hast despised the work of the Holy Ghost, and hast magnified the\nwill of the flesh, and of the legal mind.  Thou art a Diabolonian, the\nson of a Diabolonian; and for thy Diabolonian principles thou must die.’\n\nThe court then, having proceeded thus far with them, sent out the jury,\nwho forthwith brought them in guilty of death.  Then stood up the\nRecorder, and addressed himself to the prisoners: ‘You, the prisoners at\nthe bar, you have been here indicted, and proved guilty of high crimes\nagainst Emmanuel our Prince, and against the welfare of the famous town\nof Mansoul, crimes for which you must be put to death, and die ye\naccordingly.’  So they were sentenced to the death of the cross.  The\nplace assigned them for execution, was that where Diabolus drew up his\nlast army against Mansoul; save only that old Evil-Questioning was hanged\nat the top of Bad Street, just over against his own door.\n\nWhen the town of Mansoul had thus far rid themselves of their enemies,\nand of the troublers of their peace, in the next place a strict\ncommandment was given out, that yet my Lord Willbewill should, with\nDiligence his man, search for, and do his best to apprehend what town\nDiabolonians were yet left alive in Mansoul.  The names of several of\nthem were, Mr. Fooling, Mr. Let-Good-Slip, Mr. Slavish-Fear, Mr. No-Love,\nMr. Mistrust, Mr. Flesh, and Mr. Sloth.  It was also commanded, that he\nshould apprehend Mr. Evil-Questioning’s children, that he left behind\nhim, and that they should demolish his house.  The children that he left\nbehind him were these: Mr. Doubt, and he was his eldest son; the next to\nhim was Legal-Life, Unbelief, Wrong-Thoughts-of-Christ, Clip-Promise,\nCarnal-Sense, Live-by-Feeling, Self-Love.  All these he had by one wife,\nand her name was No-Hope; she was the kinswoman of old Incredulity, for\nhe was her uncle; and when her father, old Dark, was dead, he took her\nand brought her up, and when she was marriageable, he gave her to this\nold Evil-Questioning to wife.\n\nNow the Lord Willbewill did put into execution his commission, with great\nDiligence, his man.  He took Fooling in the streets, and hanged him up in\nWant-wit-Alley, over against his own house.  This Fooling was he that\nwould have had the town of Mansoul deliver up Captain Credence into the\nhands of Diabolus, provided that then he would have withdrawn his force\nout of the town.  He also took Mr. Let-Good-Slip one day as he was busy\nin the market, and executed him according to law.  Now there was an\nhonest poor man in Mansoul, and his name was Mr. Meditation, one of no\ngreat account in the days of apostasy, but now of repute with the best of\nthe town.  This man, therefore, they were willing to prefer.  Now Mr.\nLet-Good-Slip had a great deal of wealth heretofore in Mansoul, and, at\nEmmanuel’s coming, it was sequestered to the use of the Prince: this,\ntherefore, was now given to Mr. Meditation, to improve for the common\ngood, and after him to his son, Mr. Think-Well; this Think-Well he had by\nMrs. Piety his wife, and she was the daughter of Mr. Recorder.\n\nAfter this, my lord apprehended Clip-Promise: now because he was a\nnotorious villain, for by his doings much of the King’s coin was abused,\ntherefore he was made a public example.  He was arraigned and judged to\nbe first set in the pillory, then to be whipped by all the children and\nservants in Mansoul, and then to be hanged till he was dead.  Some may\nwonder at the severity of this man’s punishment; but those that are\nhonest traders in Mansoul, are sensible of the great abuse that one\nclipper of promises in little time may do to the town of Mansoul.  And\ntruly my judgment is, that all those of his name and life should be\nserved even as he.\n\nHe also apprehended Carnal-Sense, and put him in hold; but how it came\nabout, I cannot tell, but he brake prison, and made his escape: yea, and\nthe bold villain will not yet quit the town, but lurks in the Diabolonian\ndens a days, and haunts like a ghost honest men’s houses a nights.\nWherefore, there was a proclamation set up in the market-place in\nMansoul, signifying that whosoever could discover Carnal-Sense, and\napprehend him and slay him, should be admitted daily to the Prince’s\ntable, and should be made keeper of the treasure of Mansoul.  Many,\ntherefore, did bend themselves to do this thing, but take him and slay\nhim they could not, though often he was discovered.\n\nBut my lord took Mr. Wrong-Thoughts-of-Christ, and put him in prison, and\nhe died there; though it was long first, for he died of a lingering\nconsumption.\n\nSelf-Love was also taken and committed to custody; but there were many\nthat were allied to him in Mansoul, so his judgment was deferred.  But at\nlast Mr. Self-Denial stood up, and said: ‘If such villains as these may\nbe winked at in Mansoul, I will lay down my commission.’  He also took\nhim from the crowd, and had him among his soldiers, and there he was\nbrained.  But some in Mansoul muttered at it, though none durst speak\nplainly, because Emmanuel was in town.  But this brave act of Captain\nSelf-Denial came to the Prince’s ears; so he sent for him, and made him a\nlord in Mansoul.  My Lord Willbewill also obtained great commendations of\nEmmanuel, for what he had done for the town of Mansoul.\n\nThen my Lord Self-Denial took courage, and set to the pursuing of the\nDiabolonians, with my Lord Willbewill; and they took Live-by-Feeling, and\nthey took Legal-Life, and put them in hold till they died.  But Mr.\nUnbelief was a nimble Jack: him they could never lay hold of, though they\nattempted to do it often.  He therefore, and some few more of the\nsubtlest of the Diabolonian tribe, did yet remain in Mansoul, to the time\nthat Mansoul left off to dwell any longer in the kingdom of Universe.\nBut they kept them to their dens and holes: if one of them did appear, or\nhappen to be seen in any of the streets of the town of Mansoul, the whole\ntown would be up in arms after them; yea, the very children in Mansoul\nwould cry out after them as after a thief, and would wish that they might\nstone them to death with stones.  And now did Mansoul arrive to some good\ndegree of peace and quiet; her Prince also did abide within her borders;\nher captains, also, and her soldiers did their duties; and Mansoul minded\nher trade that she had with the country that was afar off; also she was\nbusy in her manufacture.\n\nWhen the town of Mansoul had thus far rid themselves of so many of their\nenemies, and the troublers of their peace, the Prince sent to them, and\nappointed a day wherein he would, at the market-place, meet the whole\npeople, and there give them in charge concerning some further matters,\nthat, if observed, would tend to their further safety and comfort, and to\nthe condemnation and destruction of their home-bred Diabolonians.  So the\nday appointed was come, and the townsmen met together; Emmanuel also came\ndown in his chariot, and all his captains in their state attending him,\non the right hand and on the left.  Then was an oyes made for silence,\nand, after some mutual carriages of love, the Prince began, and thus\nproceeded:—\n\n‘You, my Mansoul, and the beloved of mine heart, many and great are the\nprivileges that I have bestowed upon you; I have singled you out from\nothers, and have chosen you to myself, not for your worthiness, but for\nmine own sake.  I have also redeemed you, not only from the dread of my\nFather’s law, but from the hand of Diabolus.  This I have done because I\nloved you, and because I have set my heart upon you to do you good.  I\nhave also, that all things, that might hinder thy way to the pleasures of\nparadise might be taken out of the way, laid down for thee for thy soul a\nplenary satisfaction, and have bought thee to myself; a price not of\ncorruptible things, as of silver and gold, but a price of blood, mine own\nblood, which I have freely spilled upon the ground to make thee mine.  So\nI have reconciled thee, O my Mansoul, to my Father, and entrusted thee in\nthe mansion houses that are with my Father in the royal city, where\nthings are, O my Mansoul, that eye hath not seen, nor hath entered into\nthe heart of man to conceive.\n\n‘Besides, O my Mansoul, thou seest what I have done, and how I have taken\nthee out of the hands of thine enemies: unto whom thou hadst deeply\nrevolted from my Father, and by whom thou wast content to be possessed,\nand also to be destroyed.  I came to thee first by my law, then by my\ngospel, to awaken thee, and show thee my glory.  And thou knowest what\nthou wast, what thou saidst, what thou didst, and how many times thou\nrebelledst against my Father and me; yet I left thee not as thou seest\nthis day, but came to thee, have borne thy manners, have waited upon\nthee, and, after all, accepted of thee, even of my mere grace and favour;\nand would not suffer thee to be lost, as thou most willingly wouldst have\nbeen.  I also compassed thee about, and afflicted thee on every side,\nthat I might make thee weary of thy ways, and bring down thy heart with\nmolestation to a willingness to close with thy good and happiness.  And\nwhen I had gotten a complete conquest over thee, I turned it to thy\nadvantage.\n\n‘Thou seest, also, what a company of my Father’s host I have lodged\nwithin thy borders: captains and rulers, soldiers and men of war, engines\nand excellent devices to subdue and bring down thy foes; thou knowest my\nmeaning, O Mansoul.  And they are my servants, and thine, too, Mansoul.\nYea, my design of possessing of thee with them, and the natural tendency\nof each of them is to defend, purge, strengthen, and sweeten thee for\nmyself, O Mansoul, and to make thee meet for my Father’s presence,\nblessing, and glory; for thou, my Mansoul, art created to be prepared\nunto these.\n\n‘Thou seest, moreover, my Mansoul, how I have passed by thy backslidings,\nand have healed thee.  Indeed I was angry with thee, but I have turned\nmine anger away from thee, because I loved thee still, and mine anger and\nmine indignation is ceased in the destruction of thine enemies, O\nMansoul.  Nor did thy goodness fetch me again unto thee, after that I for\nthy transgressions have hid my face, and withdrawn my presence from thee.\nThe way of backsliding was thine, but the way and means of thy recovery\nwas mine.  I invented the means of thy return; it was I that made an\nhedge and a wall, when thou wast beginning to turn to things in which I\ndelighted not.  It was I that made thy sweet bitter, thy day night, thy\nsmooth way thorny, and that also confounded all that sought thy\ndestruction.  It was I that set Mr. Godly-Fear to work in Mansoul.  It\nwas I that stirred up thy conscience and understanding, thy will and thy\naffections, after thy great and woful decay.  It was I that put life into\nthee, O Mansoul, to seek me, that thou mightest find me, and in thy\nfinding find thine own health, happiness, and salvation.  It was I that\nfetched the second time the Diabolonians out of Mansoul; and it was I\nthat overcame them, and that destroyed them before thy face.\n\n‘And now, my Mansoul, I am returned to thee in peace, and thy\ntransgressions against me are as if they had not been.  Nor shall it be\nwith thee as in former days, but I will do better for thee than at thy\nbeginning.\n\nFor yet a little while, O my Mansoul, even after a few more times are\ngone over thy head, I will (but be not thou troubled at what I say) take\ndown this famous town of Mansoul, stick and stone, to the ground.  And I\nwill carry the stones thereof, and the timber thereof, and the walls\nthereof, and the dust thereof, and the inhabitants thereof, into mine own\ncountry, even into a kingdom of my Father; and will there set it up in\nsuch strength and glory, as it never did see in the kingdom where now it\nis placed.  I will even there set it up for my Father’s habitation; for\nfor that purpose it was at first erected in the kingdom of Universe; and\nthere will I make it a spectacle of wonder, a monument of mercy, and the\nadmirer of its own mercy.  There shall the natives of Mansoul see all\nthat, of which they have seen nothing here: there shall they be equal to\nthose unto whom they have been inferior here.  And there shalt thou, O my\nMansoul, have such communion with me, with my Father, and with your Lord\nSecretary, as it is not possible here to be enjoyed, nor ever could be,\nshouldest thou live in Universe the space of a thousand years.\n\n‘And there, O my Mansoul, thou shalt be afraid of murderers no more; of\nDiabolonians, and their threats, no more.  There, there shall be no more\nplots, nor contrivances, nor designs against thee, O my Mansoul.  There\nthou shalt no more hear the evil-tidings, or the noise of the Diabolonian\ndrum.  There thou shalt not see the Diabolonian standard-bearers, nor yet\nbehold Diabolus’s standard.  No Diabolonian mount shall be cast up\nagainst thee there; nor shall there the Diabolonian standard be set up to\nmake thee afraid.  There thou shalt not need captains, engines, soldiers,\nand men of war.  There thou shalt meet with no sorrow, nor grief, nor\nshall it be possible that any Diabolonian should again, for ever, be able\nto creep into thy skirts, burrow in thy walls, or be seen again within\nthy borders all the days of eternity.  Life shall there last longer than\nhere you are able to desire it should; and yet it shall always be sweet\nand new, nor shall any impediment attend it for ever.\n\n‘There, O Mansoul, thou shalt meet with many of those that have been like\nthee, and that have been partakers of thy sorrows; even such as I have\nchosen, and redeemed, and set apart, as thou, for my Father’s court and\ncity-royal.  All they will be glad in thee, and thou, when thou seest\nthem, shalt be glad in thine heart.\n\n‘There are things, O Mansoul, even things of my Father’s providing, and\nmine, that never were seen since the beginning of the world; and they are\nlaid up with my Father, and sealed up among his treasures for thee, till\nthou shalt come thither to enjoy them.  I told you before, that I would\nremove my Mansoul, and set it up elsewhere; and where I will set it,\nthere are those that love thee, and those that rejoice in thee now; but\nhow much more, when they shall see thee exalted to honour!  My Father\nwill then send them for you to fetch you; and their bosoms are chariots\nto put you in.  And you, O my Mansoul, shall ride upon the wings of the\nwind.  They will come to convey, conduct, and bring you to that, when\nyour eyes see more, that will be your desired haven.\n\n‘And thus, O my Mansoul, I have showed unto thee what shall be done to\nthee hereafter, if thou canst hear, if thou canst understand; and now I\nwill tell thee what at present must be thy duty and practice, until I\ncome and fetch thee to myself, according as is related in the Scriptures\nof truth.\n\n‘First, I charge thee that thou dost hereafter keep more white and clean\nthe liveries which I gave thee before my last withdrawing from thee.  Do\nit, I say, for this will be thy wisdom.  They are in themselves fine\nlinen, but thou must keep them white and clean.  This will be your\nwisdom, your honour, and will be greatly for my glory.  When your\ngarments are white, the world will count you mine.  Also, when your\ngarments are white, then I am delighted in your ways; for then your\ngoings to and fro will be like a flash of lightning, that those that are\npresent must take notice of; also their eyes will be made to dazzle\nthereat.  Deck thyself, therefore, according to my bidding, and make\nthyself by my law straight steps for thy feet; so shall thy King greatly\ndesire thy beauty, for he is thy Lord, and worship thou him.\n\n‘Now, that thou mayest keep them as I bid thee, I have, as I before did\ntell thee, provided for thee an open fountain to wash thy garments in.\nLook, therefore, that thou wash often in my fountain, and go not in\ndefiled garments; for as it is to my dishonour and my disgrace, so it\nwill be to thy discomfort, when you shall walk in filthy garments.  Let\nnot, therefore, my garments, your garments, the garments that I gave\nthee, be defiled or spotted by the flesh.  Keep thy garments always\nwhite, and let thy head lack no ointment.\n\n‘My Mansoul, I have ofttimes delivered thee from the designs, plots,\nattempts, and conspiracies of Diabolus; and for all this I ask thee\nnothing, but that thou render not to me evil for my good; but that thou\nbear in mind my love, and the continuation of my kindness to my beloved\nMansoul, so as to provoke thee to walk in thy measure according to the\nbenefit bestowed on thee.  Of old, the sacrifices were bound with cords\nto the horns of the altar.  Consider what is said to thee, O my blessed\nMansoul.\n\n‘O my Mansoul, I have lived, I have died, I live, and will die no more\nfor thee.  I live, that thou mayest not die.  Because I live, thou shalt\nlive also.  I reconciled thee to my Father by the blood of my cross; and\nbeing reconciled, thou shalt live through me.  I will pray for thee; I\nwill fight for thee; I will yet do thee good.\n\n‘Nothing can hurt thee but sin; nothing can grieve me but sin; nothing\ncan make thee base before thy foes but sin: take heed of sin, my Mansoul.\n\n‘And dost thou know why I at first, and do still, suffer Diabolonians to\ndwell in thy walls, O Mansoul?  It is to keep thee wakening, to try thy\nlove, to make thee watchful, and to cause thee yet to prize my noble\ncaptains, their soldiers, and my mercy.\n\n‘It is also, that yet thou mayest be made to remember what a deplorable\ncondition thou once wast in.  I mean when, not some, but all did dwell,\nnot in thy walls, but in thy castle, and in thy stronghold, O Mansoul.\n\n‘O my Mansoul, should I slay all them within, many there be without, that\nwould bring thee into bondage; for were all these within cut off, those\nwithout would find thee sleeping; and then, as in a moment, they would\nswallow up my Mansoul.  I therefore left them in thee, not to do thee\nhurt (the which they yet will, if thou hearken to them, and serve them,)\nbut to do thee good, the which they must, if thou watch and fight against\nthem.  Know, therefore, that whatever they shall tempt thee to, my design\nis, that they should drive thee, not further off, but nearer to my\nfather, to learn thee war, to make petitioning desirable to thee, and to\nmake thee little in thine own eyes.  Hearken diligently to this, my\nMansoul.\n\n‘Show me, then, thy love, my Mansoul, and let not those that are within\nthy walls, take thy affections off from him that hath redeemed thy soul.\nYea, let the sight of a Diabolonian heighten thy love to me.  I came\nonce, and twice, and thrice, to save thee from the poison of those arrows\nthat would have wrought thy death: stand for me, thy Friend, my Mansoul,\nagainst the Diabolonians, and I will stand for thee before my Father, and\nall his court.  Love me against temptation, and I will love thee\nnotwithstanding thine infirmities.\n\n‘O my Mansoul, remember what my captains, my soldiers, and mine engines\nhave done for thee.  They have fought for thee, they have suffered by\nthee, they have borne much at thy hands to do thee good, O Mansoul.\nHadst thou not had them to help thee, Diabolus had certainly made a hand\nof thee.  Nourish them, therefore, my Mansoul.  When thou dost well, they\nwill be well; when thou dost ill, they will be ill, and sick, and weak.\nMake not my captains sick, O Mansoul; for if they be sick, thou canst not\nbe well; if they be weak, thou canst not be strong; if they be faint,\nthou canst not be stout and valiant for thy King, O Mansoul.  Nor must\nthou think always to live by sense: thou must live upon my word.  Thou\nmust believe, O my Mansoul, when I am from thee, that yet I love thee,\nand bear thee upon mine heart for ever.\n\n‘Remember, therefore, O my Mansoul, that thou art beloved of me: as I\nhave, therefore, taught thee to watch, to fight, to pray, and to make war\nagainst my foes; so now I command thee to believe that my love is\nconstant to thee.  O my Mansoul, how have I set my heart, my love upon\nthee!  Watch.  Behold, I lay none other burden upon thee, than what thou\nhast already.  Hold fast, till I come.’\n\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n\n{0}  Unfortunately the illustrations are still in copyright in the UK\n(where I live), and so have not been included.
