 "text": "A PAIR OF BLUE EYES\n\nby Thomas Hardy\n\n\n\n      ‘A violet in the youth of primy nature,\n       Forward, not permanent, sweet not lasting,\n       The perfume and suppliance of a minute;\n       No more.’\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\nThe following chapters were written at a time when the craze for\nindiscriminate church-restoration had just reached the remotest nooks\nof western England, where the wild and tragic features of the coast\nhad long combined in perfect harmony with the crude Gothic Art of the\necclesiastical buildings scattered along it, throwing into extraordinary\ndiscord all architectural attempts at newness there. To restore the\ngrey carcases of a mediaevalism whose spirit had fled, seemed a not\nless incongruous act than to set about renovating the adjoining crags\nthemselves.\n\nHence it happened that an imaginary history of three human hearts,\nwhose emotions were not without correspondence with these\nmaterial circumstances, found in the ordinary incidents of such\nchurch-renovations a fitting frame for its presentation.\n\nThe shore and country about ‘Castle Boterel’ is now getting well known,\nand will be readily recognized. The spot is, I may add, the furthest\nwestward of all those convenient corners wherein I have ventured to\nerect my theatre for these imperfect little dramas of country life and\npassions; and it lies near to, or no great way beyond, the vague border\nof the Wessex kingdom on that side, which, like the westering verge of\nmodern American settlements, was progressive and uncertain.\n\nThis, however, is of little importance. The place is pre-eminently (for\none person at least) the region of dream and mystery. The ghostly birds,\nthe pall-like sea, the frothy wind, the eternal soliloquy of the waters,\nthe bloom of dark purple cast, that seems to exhale from the shoreward\nprecipices, in themselves lend to the scene an atmosphere like the\ntwilight of a night vision.\n\nOne enormous sea-bord cliff in particular figures in the narrative; and\nfor some forgotten reason or other this cliff was described in the story\nas being without a name. Accuracy would require the statement to be\nthat a remarkable cliff which resembles in many points the cliff of the\ndescription bears a name that no event has made famous.\n\n                                         T. H.\nMarch 1899\n\n\n\n\n                          THE PERSONS\n\n        ELFRIDE SWANCOURT            a young Lady\n        CHRISTOPHER SWANCOURT        a Clergyman\n        STEPHEN SMITH                an Architect\n        HENRY KNIGHT                 a Reviewer and Essayist\n        CHARLOTTE TROYTON            a rich Widow\n        GERTRUDE JETHWAY             a poor Widow\n        SPENSER HUGO LUXELLIAN       a Peer\n        LADY LUXELLIAN               his Wife\n        MARY AND KATE                two little Girls\n        WILLIAM WORM                 a dazed Factotum\n        JOHN SMITH                   a Master-mason\n        JANE SMITH                   his Wife\n        MARTIN CANNISTER             a Sexton\n        UNITY                        a Maid-servant\n\n  Other servants, masons, labourers, grooms, nondescripts, etc., etc.\n\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nMostly on the outskirts of Lower Wessex.\n\n\n\n\nChapter I\n\n     ‘A fair vestal, throned in the west’\n\n\nElfride Swancourt was a girl whose emotions lay very near the surface.\nTheir nature more precisely, and as modified by the creeping hours\nof time, was known only to those who watched the circumstances of her\nhistory.\n\nPersonally, she was the combination of very interesting particulars,\nwhose rarity, however, lay in the combination itself rather than in the\nindividual elements combined. As a matter of fact, you did not see the\nform and substance of her features when conversing with her; and this\ncharming power of preventing a material study of her lineaments by an\ninterlocutor, originated not in the cloaking effect of a well-formed\nmanner (for her manner was childish and scarcely formed), but in the\nattractive crudeness of the remarks themselves. She had lived all her\nlife in retirement--the monstrari gigito of idle men had not flattered\nher, and at the age of nineteen or twenty she was no further on in\nsocial consciousness than an urban young lady of fifteen.\n\nOne point in her, however, you did notice: that was her eyes. In them\nwas seen a sublimation of all of her; it was not necessary to look\nfurther: there she lived.\n\nThese eyes were blue; blue as autumn distance--blue as the blue we see\nbetween the retreating mouldings of hills and woody slopes on a sunny\nSeptember morning. A misty and shady blue, that had no beginning or\nsurface, and was looked INTO rather than AT.\n\nAs to her presence, it was not powerful; it was weak. Some women can\nmake their personality pervade the atmosphere of a whole banqueting\nhall; Elfride’s was no more pervasive than that of a kitten.\n\nElfride had as her own the thoughtfulness which appears in the face of\nthe Madonna della Sedia, without its rapture: the warmth and spirit\nof the type of woman’s feature most common to the beauties--mortal\nand immortal--of Rubens, without their insistent fleshiness. The\ncharacteristic expression of the female faces of Correggio--that of the\nyearning human thoughts that lie too deep for tears--was hers sometimes,\nbut seldom under ordinary conditions.\n\nThe point in Elfride Swancourt’s life at which a deeper current may be\nsaid to have permanently set in, was one winter afternoon when she found\nherself standing, in the character of hostess, face to face with a man\nshe had never seen before--moreover, looking at him with a Miranda-like\ncuriosity and interest that she had never yet bestowed on a mortal.\n\nOn this particular day her father, the vicar of a parish on the\nsea-swept outskirts of Lower Wessex, and a widower, was suffering from\nan attack of gout. After finishing her household supervisions Elfride\nbecame restless, and several times left the room, ascended the\nstaircase, and knocked at her father’s chamber-door.\n\n‘Come in!’ was always answered in a hearty out-of-door voice from the\ninside.\n\n‘Papa,’ she said on one occasion to the fine, red-faced, handsome man of\nforty, who, puffing and fizzing like a bursting bottle, lay on the bed\nwrapped in a dressing-gown, and every now and then enunciating, in spite\nof himself, about one letter of some word or words that were almost\noaths; ‘papa, will you not come downstairs this evening?’ She spoke\ndistinctly: he was rather deaf.\n\n‘Afraid not--eh-hh!--very much afraid I shall not, Elfride. Piph-ph-ph!\nI can’t bear even a handkerchief upon this deuced toe of mine, much less\na stocking or slipper--piph-ph-ph! There ‘tis again! No, I shan’t get up\ntill to-morrow.’\n\n‘Then I hope this London man won’t come; for I don’t know what I should\ndo, papa.’\n\n‘Well, it would be awkward, certainly.’\n\n‘I should hardly think he would come to-day.’\n\n‘Why?’\n\n‘Because the wind blows so.’\n\n‘Wind! What ideas you have, Elfride! Who ever heard of wind stopping a\nman from doing his business? The idea of this toe of mine coming on so\nsuddenly!...If he should come, you must send him up to me, I suppose,\nand then give him some food and put him to bed in some way. Dear me,\nwhat a nuisance all this is!’\n\n‘Must he have dinner?’\n\n‘Too heavy for a tired man at the end of a tedious journey.’\n\n‘Tea, then?’\n\n‘Not substantial enough.’\n\n‘High tea, then? There is cold fowl, rabbit-pie, some pasties, and\nthings of that kind.’\n\n‘Yes, high tea.’\n\n‘Must I pour out his tea, papa?’\n\n‘Of course; you are the mistress of the house.’\n\n‘What! sit there all the time with a stranger, just as if I knew him,\nand not anybody to introduce us?’\n\n‘Nonsense, child, about introducing; you know better than that. A\npractical professional man, tired and hungry, who has been travelling\never since daylight this morning, will hardly be inclined to talk and\nair courtesies to-night. He wants food and shelter, and you must see\nthat he has it, simply because I am suddenly laid up and cannot. There\nis nothing so dreadful in that, I hope? You get all kinds of stuff into\nyour head from reading so many of those novels.’\n\n‘Oh no; there is nothing dreadful in it when it becomes plainly a case\nof necessity like this. But, you see, you are always there when people\ncome to dinner, even if we know them; and this is some strange London\nman of the world, who will think it odd, perhaps.’\n\n‘Very well; let him.’\n\n‘Is he Mr. Hewby’s partner?’\n\n‘I should scarcely think so: he may be.’\n\n‘How old is he, I wonder?’\n\n‘That I cannot tell. You will find the copy of my letter to Mr. Hewby,\nand his answer, upon the table in the study. You may read them, and then\nyou’ll know as much as I do about our visitor.’\n\n‘I have read them.’\n\n‘Well, what’s the use of asking questions, then? They contain all I\nknow. Ugh-h-h!...Od plague you, you young scamp! don’t put anything\nthere! I can’t bear the weight of a fly.’\n\n‘Oh, I am sorry, papa. I forgot; I thought you might be cold,’ she said,\nhastily removing the rug she had thrown upon the feet of the sufferer;\nand waiting till she saw that consciousness of her offence had passed\nfrom his face, she withdrew from the room, and retired again downstairs.\n\n\n\n\nChapter II\n\n     ‘Twas on the evening of a winter’s day.’\n\n\nWhen two or three additional hours had merged the same afternoon in\nevening, some moving outlines might have been observed against the sky\non the summit of a wild lone hill in that district. They circumscribed\ntwo men, having at present the aspect of silhouettes, sitting in a\ndog-cart and pushing along in the teeth of the wind. Scarcely a solitary\nhouse or man had been visible along the whole dreary distance of open\ncountry they were traversing; and now that night had begun to fall,\nthe faint twilight, which still gave an idea of the landscape to\ntheir observation, was enlivened by the quiet appearance of the planet\nJupiter, momentarily gleaming in intenser brilliancy in front of them,\nand by Sirius shedding his rays in rivalry from his position over their\nshoulders. The only lights apparent on earth were some spots of dull\nred, glowing here and there upon the distant hills, which, as the driver\nof the vehicle gratuitously remarked to the hirer, were smouldering\nfires for the consumption of peat and gorse-roots, where the common was\nbeing broken up for agricultural purposes. The wind prevailed with but\nlittle abatement from its daytime boisterousness, three or four small\nclouds, delicate and pale, creeping along under the sky southward to the\nChannel.\n\nFourteen of the sixteen miles intervening between the railway terminus\nand the end of their journey had been gone over, when they began to pass\nalong the brink of a valley some miles in extent, wherein the wintry\nskeletons of a more luxuriant vegetation than had hitherto surrounded\nthem proclaimed an increased richness of soil, which showed signs of far\nmore careful enclosure and management than had any slopes they had yet\npassed. A little farther, and an opening in the elms stretching up from\nthis fertile valley revealed a mansion.\n\n‘That’s Endelstow House, Lord Luxellian’s,’ said the driver.\n\n‘Endelstow House, Lord Luxellian’s,’ repeated the other mechanically.\nHe then turned himself sideways, and keenly scrutinized the almost\ninvisible house with an interest which the indistinct picture itself\nseemed far from adequate to create. ‘Yes, that’s Lord Luxellian’s,’ he\nsaid yet again after a while, as he still looked in the same direction.\n\n‘What, be we going there?’\n\n‘No; Endelstow Vicarage, as I have told you.’\n\n‘I thought you m’t have altered your mind, sir, as ye have stared that\nway at nothing so long.’\n\n‘Oh no; I am interested in the house, that’s all.’\n\n‘Most people be, as the saying is.’\n\n‘Not in the sense that I am.’\n\n‘Oh!...Well, his family is no better than my own, ‘a b’lieve.’\n\n‘How is that?’\n\n‘Hedgers and ditchers by rights. But once in ancient times one of ‘em,\nwhen he was at work, changed clothes with King Charles the Second, and\nsaved the king’s life. King Charles came up to him like a common man,\nand said off-hand, “Man in the smock-frock, my name is Charles the\nSecond, and that’s the truth on’t. Will you lend me your clothes?” “I\ndon’t mind if I do,” said Hedger Luxellian; and they changed there and\nthen. “Now mind ye,” King Charles the Second said, like a common man, as\nhe rode away, “if ever I come to the crown, you come to court, knock at\nthe door, and say out bold, ‘Is King Charles the Second at home?’ Tell\nyour name, and they shall let you in, and you shall be made a lord.”\n Now, that was very nice of Master Charley?’\n\n‘Very nice indeed.’\n\n‘Well, as the story is, the king came to the throne; and some years\nafter that, away went Hedger Luxellian, knocked at the king’s door,\nand asked if King Charles the Second was in. “No, he isn’t,” they said.\n“Then, is Charles the Third?” said Hedger Luxellian. “Yes,” said a young\nfeller standing by like a common man, only he had a crown on, “my name\nis Charles the Third.” And----’\n\n‘I really fancy that must be a mistake. I don’t recollect anything in\nEnglish history about Charles the Third,’ said the other in a tone of\nmild remonstrance.\n\n‘Oh, that’s right history enough, only ‘twasn’t prented; he was rather a\nqueer-tempered man, if you remember.’\n\n‘Very well; go on.’\n\n‘And, by hook or by crook, Hedger Luxellian was made a lord, and\neverything went on well till some time after, when he got into a most\nterrible row with King Charles the Fourth.\n\n‘I can’t stand Charles the Fourth. Upon my word, that’s too much.’\n\n‘Why? There was a George the Fourth, wasn’t there?’\n\n‘Certainly.’\n\n‘Well, Charleses be as common as Georges. However I’ll say no more about\nit....Ah, well! ‘tis the funniest world ever I lived in--upon my life\n‘tis. Ah, that such should be!’\n\nThe dusk had thickened into darkness while they thus conversed, and the\noutline and surface of the mansion gradually disappeared. The windows,\nwhich had before been as black blots on a lighter expanse of wall,\nbecame illuminated, and were transfigured to squares of light on the\ngeneral dark body of the night landscape as it absorbed the outlines of\nthe edifice into its gloomy monochrome.\n\nNot another word was spoken for some time, and they climbed a hill, then\nanother hill piled on the summit of the first. An additional mile of\nplateau followed, from which could be discerned two light-houses on the\ncoast they were nearing, reposing on the horizon with a calm lustre of\nbenignity. Another oasis was reached; a little dell lay like a nest at\ntheir feet, towards which the driver pulled the horse at a sharp angle,\nand descended a steep slope which dived under the trees like a rabbit’s\nburrow. They sank lower and lower.\n\n‘Endelstow Vicarage is inside here,’ continued the man with the reins.\n‘This part about here is West Endelstow; Lord Luxellian’s is East\nEndelstow, and has a church to itself. Pa’son Swancourt is the pa’son\nof both, and bobs backward and forward. Ah, well! ‘tis a funny world.\n‘A b’lieve there was once a quarry where this house stands. The man who\nbuilt it in past time scraped all the glebe for earth to put round the\nvicarage, and laid out a little paradise of flowers and trees in the\nsoil he had got together in this way, whilst the fields he scraped have\nbeen good for nothing ever since.’\n\n‘How long has the present incumbent been here?’\n\n‘Maybe about a year, or a year and half: ‘tisn’t two years; for they\ndon’t scandalize him yet; and, as a rule, a parish begins to scandalize\nthe pa’son at the end of two years among ‘em familiar. But he’s a very\nnice party. Ay, Pa’son Swancourt knows me pretty well from often driving\nover; and I know Pa’son Swancourt.’\n\nThey emerged from the bower, swept round in a curve, and the chimneys\nand gables of the vicarage became darkly visible. Not a light showed\nanywhere. They alighted; the man felt his way into the porch, and rang\nthe bell.\n\nAt the end of three or four minutes, spent in patient waiting without\nhearing any sounds of a response, the stranger advanced and repeated the\ncall in a more decided manner. He then fancied he heard footsteps in the\nhall, and sundry movements of the door-knob, but nobody appeared.\n\n‘Perhaps they beant at home,’ sighed the driver. ‘And I promised myself\na bit of supper in Pa’son Swancourt’s kitchen. Sich lovely mate-pize and\nfigged keakes, and cider, and drops o’ cordial that they do keep here!’\n\n‘All right, naibours! Be ye rich men or be ye poor men, that ye must\nneeds come to the world’s end at this time o’ night?’ exclaimed a voice\nat this instant; and, turning their heads, they saw a rickety individual\nshambling round from the back door with a horn lantern dangling from his\nhand.\n\n‘Time o’ night, ‘a b’lieve! and the clock only gone seven of ‘em. Show a\nlight, and let us in, William Worm.’\n\n‘Oh, that you, Robert Lickpan?’\n\n‘Nobody else, William Worm.’\n\n‘And is the visiting man a-come?’\n\n‘Yes,’ said the stranger. ‘Is Mr. Swancourt at home?’\n\n‘That ‘a is, sir. And would ye mind coming round by the back way? The\nfront door is got stuck wi’ the wet, as he will do sometimes; and the\nTurk can’t open en. I know I am only a poor wambling man that ‘ill never\npay the Lord for my making, sir; but I can show the way in, sir.’\n\nThe new arrival followed his guide through a little door in a wall, and\nthen promenaded a scullery and a kitchen, along which he passed with\neyes rigidly fixed in advance, an inbred horror of prying forbidding\nhim to gaze around apartments that formed the back side of the household\ntapestry. Entering the hall, he was about to be shown to his room, when\nfrom the inner lobby of the front entrance, whither she had gone to\nlearn the cause of the delay, sailed forth the form of Elfride. Her\nstart of amazement at the sight of the visitor coming forth from under\nthe stairs proved that she had not been expecting this surprising flank\nmovement, which had been originated entirely by the ingenuity of William\nWorm.\n\nShe appeared in the prettiest of all feminine guises, that is to say, in\ndemi-toilette, with plenty of loose curly hair tumbling down about her\nshoulders. An expression of uneasiness pervaded her countenance; and\naltogether she scarcely appeared woman enough for the situation. The\nvisitor removed his hat, and the first words were spoken; Elfride\nprelusively looking with a deal of interest, not unmixed with surprise,\nat the person towards whom she was to do the duties of hospitality.\n\n‘I am Mr. Smith,’ said the stranger in a musical voice.\n\n‘I am Miss Swancourt,’ said Elfride.\n\nHer constraint was over. The great contrast between the reality she\nbeheld before her, and the dark, taciturn, sharp, elderly man of\nbusiness who had lurked in her imagination--a man with clothes smelling\nof city smoke, skin sallow from want of sun, and talk flavoured with\nepigram--was such a relief to her that Elfride smiled, almost laughed,\nin the new-comer’s face.\n\nStephen Smith, who has hitherto been hidden from us by the darkness, was\nat this time of his life but a youth in appearance, and barely a man\nin years. Judging from his look, London was the last place in the world\nthat one would have imagined to be the scene of his activities: such a\nface surely could not be nourished amid smoke and mud and fog and dust;\nsuch an open countenance could never even have seen anything of ‘the\nweariness, the fever, and the fret’ of Babylon the Second.\n\nHis complexion was as fine as Elfride’s own; the pink of his cheeks as\ndelicate. His mouth as perfect as Cupid’s bow in form, and as cherry-red\nin colour as hers. Bright curly hair; bright sparkling blue-gray eyes;\na boy’s blush and manner; neither whisker nor moustache, unless a\nlittle light-brown fur on his upper lip deserved the latter title: this\ncomposed the London professional man, the prospect of whose advent had\nso troubled Elfride.\n\nElfride hastened to say she was sorry to tell him that Mr. Swancourt was\nnot able to receive him that evening, and gave the reason why. Mr. Smith\nreplied, in a voice boyish by nature and manly by art, that he was very\nsorry to hear this news; but that as far as his reception was concerned,\nit did not matter in the least.\n\nStephen was shown up to his room. In his absence Elfride stealthily\nglided into her father’s.\n\n‘He’s come, papa. Such a young man for a business man!’\n\n‘Oh, indeed!’\n\n‘His face is--well--PRETTY; just like mine.’\n\n‘H’m! what next?’\n\n‘Nothing; that’s all I know of him yet. It is rather nice, is it not?’\n\n‘Well, we shall see that when we know him better. Go down and give the\npoor fellow something to eat and drink, for Heaven’s sake. And when he\nhas done eating, say I should like to have a few words with him, if he\ndoesn’t mind coming up here.’\n\nThe young lady glided downstairs again, and whilst she awaits young\nSmith’s entry, the letters referring to his visit had better be given.\n\n\n1.--MR. SWANCOURT TO MR. HEWBY.\n\n‘ENDELSTOW VICARAGE, Feb. 18, 18--.\n\n‘SIR,--We are thinking of restoring the tower and aisle of the church in\nthis parish; and Lord Luxellian, the patron of the living, has mentioned\nyour name as that of a trustworthy architect whom it would be desirable\nto ask to superintend the work.\n\n‘I am exceedingly ignorant of the necessary preliminary steps. Probably,\nhowever, the first is that (should you be, as Lord Luxellian says you\nare, disposed to assist us) yourself or some member of your staff come\nand see the building, and report thereupon for the satisfaction of\nparishioners and others.\n\n‘The spot is a very remote one: we have no railway within fourteen\nmiles; and the nearest place for putting up at--called a town, though\nmerely a large village--is Castle Boterel, two miles further on; so that\nit would be most convenient for you to stay at the vicarage--which I am\nglad to place at your disposal--instead of pushing on to the hotel at\nCastle Boterel, and coming back again in the morning.\n\n‘Any day of the next week that you like to name for the visit will find\nus quite ready to receive you.--Yours very truly,\n\nCHRISTOPHER SWANCOURT.\n\n\n2.--MR. HEWBY TO MR. SWANCOURT.\n\n“PERCY PLACE, CHARING CROSS, Feb. 20, 18--.\n\n‘DEAR SIR,--Agreeably to your request of the 18th instant, I have\narranged to survey and make drawings of the aisle and tower of your\nparish church, and of the dilapidations which have been suffered to\naccrue thereto, with a view to its restoration.\n\n‘My assistant, Mr. Stephen Smith, will leave London by the early train\nto-morrow morning for the purpose. Many thanks for your proposal to\naccommodate him. He will take advantage of your offer, and will\nprobably reach your house at some hour of the evening. You may put every\nconfidence in him, and may rely upon his discernment in the matter of\nchurch architecture.\n\n‘Trusting that the plans for the restoration, which I shall prepare from\nthe details of his survey, will prove satisfactory to yourself and Lord\nLuxellian, I am, dear sir, yours faithfully,\n\nWALTER HEWBY.’\n\n\n\n\nChapter III\n\n     ‘Melodious birds sing madrigals’\n\n\nThat first repast in Endelstow Vicarage was a very agreeable one to\nyoung Stephen Smith. The table was spread, as Elfride had suggested to\nher father, with the materials for the heterogeneous meal called high\ntea--a class of refection welcome to all when away from men and towns,\nand particularly attractive to youthful palates. The table was prettily\ndecked with winter flowers and leaves, amid which the eye was greeted by\nchops, chicken, pie, &c., and two huge pasties overhanging the sides of\nthe dish with a cheerful aspect of abundance.\n\nAt the end, towards the fireplace, appeared the tea-service, of\nold-fashioned Worcester porcelain, and behind this arose the slight\nform of Elfride, attempting to add matronly dignity to the movement of\npouring out tea, and to have a weighty and concerned look in matters of\nmarmalade, honey, and clotted cream. Having made her own meal before he\narrived, she found to her embarrassment that there was nothing left for\nher to do but talk when not assisting him. She asked him if he would\nexcuse her finishing a letter she had been writing at a side-table, and,\nafter sitting down to it, tingled with a sense of being grossly rude.\nHowever, seeing that he noticed nothing personally wrong in her, and\nthat he too was embarrassed when she attentively watched his cup to\nrefill it, Elfride became better at ease; and when furthermore he\naccidentally kicked the leg of the table, and then nearly upset his\ntea-cup, just as schoolboys did, she felt herself mistress of the\nsituation, and could talk very well. In a few minutes ingenuousness\nand a common term of years obliterated all recollection that they were\nstrangers just met. Stephen began to wax eloquent on extremely slight\nexperiences connected with his professional pursuits; and she, having\nno experiences to fall back upon, recounted with much animation stories\nthat had been related to her by her father, which would have astonished\nhim had he heard with what fidelity of action and tone they were\nrendered. Upon the whole, a very interesting picture of Sweet-and-Twenty\nwas on view that evening in Mr. Swancourt’s house.\n\nUltimately Stephen had to go upstairs and talk loud to the vicar,\nreceiving from him between his puffs a great many apologies for calling\nhim so unceremoniously to a stranger’s bedroom. ‘But,’ continued Mr.\nSwancourt, ‘I felt that I wanted to say a few words to you before the\nmorning, on the business of your visit. One’s patience gets exhausted\nby staying a prisoner in bed all day through a sudden freak of one’s\nenemy--new to me, though--for I have known very little of gout as yet.\nHowever, he’s gone to my other toe in a very mild manner, and I expect\nhe’ll slink off altogether by the morning. I hope you have been well\nattended to downstairs?’\n\n‘Perfectly. And though it is unfortunate, and I am sorry to see you\nlaid up, I beg you will not take the slightest notice of my being in the\nhouse the while.’\n\n‘I will not. But I shall be down to-morrow. My daughter is an excellent\ndoctor. A dose or two of her mild mixtures will fetch me round quicker\nthan all the drug stuff in the world. Well, now about the church\nbusiness. Take a seat, do. We can’t afford to stand upon ceremony in\nthese parts as you see, and for this reason, that a civilized human\nbeing seldom stays long with us; and so we cannot waste time in\napproaching him, or he will be gone before we have had the pleasure of\nclose acquaintance. This tower of ours is, as you will notice, entirely\ngone beyond the possibility of restoration; but the church itself is\nwell enough. You should see some of the churches in this county. Floors\nrotten: ivy lining the walls.’\n\n‘Dear me!’\n\n‘Oh, that’s nothing. The congregation of a neighbour of mine, whenever\na storm of rain comes on during service, open their umbrellas and hold\nthem up till the dripping ceases from the roof. Now, if you will kindly\nbring me those papers and letters you see lying on the table, I will\nshow you how far we have got.’\n\nStephen crossed the room to fetch them, and the vicar seemed to notice\nmore particularly the slim figure of his visitor.\n\n‘I suppose you are quite competent?’ he said.\n\n‘Quite,’ said the young man, colouring slightly.\n\n‘You are very young, I fancy--I should say you are not more than\nnineteen?’\n\nI am nearly twenty-one.’\n\n‘Exactly half my age; I am forty-two.’\n\n‘By the way,’ said Mr. Swancourt, after some conversation, ‘you said\nyour whole name was Stephen Fitzmaurice, and that your grandfather came\noriginally from Caxbury. Since I have been speaking, it has occurred\nto me that I know something of you. You belong to a well-known ancient\ncounty family--not ordinary Smiths in the least.’\n\n‘I don’t think we have any of their blood in our veins.’\n\n‘Nonsense! you must. Hand me the “Landed Gentry.” Now, let me see.\nThere, Stephen Fitzmaurice Smith--he lies in St. Mary’s Church,\ndoesn’t he? Well, out of that family Sprang the Leaseworthy Smiths, and\ncollaterally came General Sir Stephen Fitzmaurice Smith of Caxbury----’\n\n‘Yes; I have seen his monument there,’ shouted Stephen. ‘But there is no\nconnection between his family and mine: there cannot be.’\n\n‘There is none, possibly, to your knowledge. But look at this, my dear\nsir,’ said the vicar, striking his fist upon the bedpost for emphasis.\n‘Here are you, Stephen Fitzmaurice Smith, living in London, but\nspringing from Caxbury. Here in this book is a genealogical tree of the\nStephen Fitzmaurice Smiths of Caxbury Manor. You may be only a family\nof professional men now--I am not inquisitive: I don’t ask questions of\nthat kind; it is not in me to do so--but it is as plain as the nose in\nyour face that there’s your origin! And, Mr. Smith, I congratulate you\nupon your blood; blue blood, sir; and, upon my life, a very desirable\ncolour, as the world goes.’\n\n‘I wish you could congratulate me upon some more tangible quality,’ said\nthe younger man, sadly no less than modestly.\n\n‘Nonsense! that will come with time. You are young: all your life is\nbefore you. Now look--see how far back in the mists of antiquity my own\nfamily of Swancourt have a root. Here, you see,’ he continued, turning\nto the page, ‘is Geoffrey, the one among my ancestors who lost a barony\nbecause he would cut his joke. Ah, it’s the sort of us! But the story\nis too long to tell now. Ay, I’m a poor man--a poor gentleman, in fact:\nthose I would be friends with, won’t be friends with me; those who are\nwilling to be friends with me, I am above being friends with. Beyond\ndining with a neighbouring incumbent or two, and an occasional\nchat--sometimes dinner--with Lord Luxellian, a connection of mine, I am\nin absolute solitude--absolute.’\n\n‘You have your studies, your books, and your--daughter.’\n\n‘Oh yes, yes; and I don’t complain of poverty. Canto coram latrone.\nWell, Mr. Smith, don’t let me detain you any longer in a sick room. Ha!\nthat reminds me of a story I once heard in my younger days.’ Here\nthe vicar began a series of small private laughs, and Stephen looked\ninquiry. ‘Oh, no, no! it is too bad--too bad to tell!’ continued Mr.\nSwancourt in undertones of grim mirth. ‘Well, go downstairs; my daughter\nmust do the best she can with you this evening. Ask her to sing to\nyou--she plays and sings very nicely. Good-night; I feel as if I had\nknown you for five or six years. I’ll ring for somebody to show you\ndown.’\n\n‘Never mind,’ said Stephen, ‘I can find the way.’ And he went\ndownstairs, thinking of the delightful freedom of manner in the remoter\ncounties in comparison with the reserve of London.\n\n\n‘I forgot to tell you that my father was rather deaf,’ said Elfride\nanxiously, when Stephen entered the little drawing-room.\n\n‘Never mind; I know all about it, and we are great friends,’ the man of\nbusiness replied enthusiastically. ‘And, Miss Swancourt, will you kindly\nsing to me?’\n\nTo Miss Swancourt this request seemed, what in fact it was,\nexceptionally point-blank; though she guessed that her father had some\nhand in framing it, knowing, rather to her cost, of his unceremonious\nway of utilizing her for the benefit of dull sojourners. At the same\ntime, as Mr. Smith’s manner was too frank to provoke criticism, and his\nage too little to inspire fear, she was ready--not to say pleased--to\naccede. Selecting from the canterbury some old family ditties, that in\nyears gone by had been played and sung by her mother, Elfride sat down\nto the pianoforte, and began, ‘’Twas on the evening of a winter’s day,’\nin a pretty contralto voice.\n\n‘Do you like that old thing, Mr. Smith?’ she said at the end.\n\n‘Yes, I do much,’ said Stephen--words he would have uttered, and\nsincerely, to anything on earth, from glee to requiem, that she might\nhave chosen.\n\n‘You shall have a little one by De Leyre, that was given me by a young\nFrench lady who was staying at Endelstow House:\n\n\n     ‘“Je l’ai plante, je l’ai vu naitre,\n       Ce beau rosier ou les oiseaux,” &c.;\n\n\nand then I shall want to give you my own favourite for the very last,\nShelley’s “When the lamp is shattered,” as set to music by my poor\nmother. I so much like singing to anybody who REALLY cares to hear me.’\n\nEvery woman who makes a permanent impression on a man is usually\nrecalled to his mind’s eye as she appeared in one particular scene,\nwhich seems ordained to be her special form of manifestation throughout\nthe pages of his memory. As the patron Saint has her attitude and\naccessories in mediaeval illumination, so the sweetheart may be said to\nhave hers upon the table of her true Love’s fancy, without which she is\nrarely introduced there except by effort; and this though she may, on\nfurther acquaintance, have been observed in many other phases which one\nwould imagine to be far more appropriate to love’s young dream.\n\nMiss Elfride’s image chose the form in which she was beheld during\nthese minutes of singing, for her permanent attitude of visitation to\nStephen’s eyes during his sleeping and waking hours in after days.\nThe profile is seen of a young woman in a pale gray silk dress with\ntrimmings of swan’s-down, and opening up from a point in front, like a\nwaistcoat without a shirt; the cool colour contrasting admirably with\nthe warm bloom of her neck and face. The furthermost candle on the piano\ncomes immediately in a line with her head, and half invisible itself,\nforms the accidentally frizzled hair into a nebulous haze of light,\nsurrounding her crown like an aureola. Her hands are in their place on\nthe keys, her lips parted, and trilling forth, in a tender diminuendo,\nthe closing words of the sad apostrophe:\n\n\n  ‘O Love, who bewailest\n     The frailty of all things here,\n   Why choose you the frailest\n     For your cradle, your home, and your bier!’\n\n\nHer head is forward a little, and her eyes directed keenly upward to the\ntop of the page of music confronting her. Then comes a rapid look into\nStephen’s face, and a still more rapid look back again to her business,\nher face having dropped its sadness, and acquired a certain expression\nof mischievous archness the while; which lingered there for some time,\nbut was never developed into a positive smile of flirtation.\n\nStephen suddenly shifted his position from her right hand to her left,\nwhere there was just room enough for a small ottoman to stand between\nthe piano and the corner of the room. Into this nook he squeezed\nhimself, and gazed wistfully up into Elfride’s face. So long and so\nearnestly gazed he, that her cheek deepened to a more and more crimson\ntint as each line was added to her song. Concluding, and pausing\nmotionless after the last word for a minute or two, she ventured to look\nat him again. His features wore an expression of unutterable heaviness.\n\n‘You don’t hear many songs, do you, Mr. Smith, to take so much notice of\nthese of mine?’\n\n‘Perhaps it was the means and vehicle of the song that I was noticing: I\nmean yourself,’ he answered gently.\n\n‘Now, Mr. Smith!’\n\n‘It is perfectly true; I don’t hear much singing. You mistake what I am,\nI fancy. Because I come as a stranger to a secluded spot, you think I\nmust needs come from a life of bustle, and know the latest movements of\nthe day. But I don’t. My life is as quiet as yours, and more solitary;\nsolitary as death.’\n\n‘The death which comes from a plethora of life? But seriously, I can\nquite see that you are not the least what I thought you would be before\nI saw you. You are not critical, or experienced, or--much to mind.\nThat’s why I don’t mind singing airs to you that I only half know.’\nFinding that by this confession she had vexed him in a way she did not\nintend, she added naively, ‘I mean, Mr. Smith, that you are better, not\nworse, for being only young and not very experienced. You don’t think my\nlife here so very tame and dull, I know.’\n\n‘I do not, indeed,’ he said with fervour. ‘It must be delightfully\npoetical, and sparkling, and fresh, and----’\n\n‘There you go, Mr. Smith! Well, men of another kind, when I get them to\nbe honest enough to own the truth, think just the reverse: that my life\nmust be a dreadful bore in its normal state, though pleasant for the\nexceptional few days they pass here.’\n\n‘I could live here always!’ he said, and with such a tone and look\nof unconscious revelation that Elfride was startled to find that her\nharmonies had fired a small Troy, in the shape of Stephen’s heart. She\nsaid quickly:\n\n‘But you can’t live here always.’\n\n‘Oh no.’ And he drew himself in with the sensitiveness of a snail.\n\nElfride’s emotions were sudden as his in kindling, but the least of\nwoman’s lesser infirmities--love of admiration--caused an inflammable\ndisposition on his part, so exactly similar to her own, to appear as\nmeritorious in him as modesty made her own seem culpable in her.\n\n\n\n\nChapter IV\n\n     ‘Where heaves the turf in many a mould’ring heap.’\n\n\nFor reasons of his own, Stephen Smith was stirring a short time after\ndawn the next morning. From the window of his room he could see, first,\ntwo bold escarpments sloping down together like the letter V. Towards\nthe bottom, like liquid in a funnel, appeared the sea, gray and small.\nOn the brow of one hill, of rather greater altitude than its neighbour,\nstood the church which was to be the scene of his operations. The lonely\nedifice was black and bare, cutting up into the sky from the very tip\nof the hill. It had a square mouldering tower, owning neither battlement\nnor pinnacle, and seemed a monolithic termination, of one substance with\nthe ridge, rather than a structure raised thereon. Round the church ran\na low wall; over-topping the wall in general level was the graveyard;\nnot as a graveyard usually is, a fragment of landscape with its due\nvariety of chiaro-oscuro, but a mere profile against the sky, serrated\nwith the outlines of graves and a very few memorial stones. Not a tree\ncould exist up there: nothing but the monotonous gray-green grass.\n\nFive minutes after this casual survey was made his bedroom was empty,\nand its occupant had vanished quietly from the house.\n\nAt the end of two hours he was again in the room, looking warm and\nglowing. He now pursued the artistic details of dressing, which on\nhis first rising had been entirely omitted. And a very blooming boy he\nlooked, after that mysterious morning scamper. His mouth was a triumph\nof its class. It was the cleanly-cut, piquantly pursed-up mouth of\nWilliam Pitt, as represented in the well or little known bust by\nNollekens--a mouth which is in itself a young man’s fortune, if properly\nexercised. His round chin, where its upper part turned inward, still\ncontinued its perfect and full curve, seeming to press in to a point the\nbottom of his nether lip at their place of junction.\n\nOnce he murmured the name of Elfride. Ah, there she was! On the lawn\nin a plain dress, without hat or bonnet, running with a boy’s\nvelocity, superadded to a girl’s lightness, after a tame rabbit she\nwas endeavouring to capture, her strategic intonations of coaxing words\nalternating with desperate rushes so much out of keeping with them, that\nthe hollowness of such expressions was but too evident to her pet, who\ndarted and dodged in carefully timed counterpart.\n\nThe scene down there was altogether different from that of the hills.\nA thicket of shrubs and trees enclosed the favoured spot from the\nwilderness without; even at this time of the year the grass was\nluxuriant there. No wind blew inside the protecting belt of evergreens,\nwasting its force upon the higher and stronger trees forming the outer\nmargin of the grove.\n\nThen he heard a heavy person shuffling about in slippers, and calling\n‘Mr. Smith!’ Smith proceeded to the study, and found Mr. Swancourt. The\nyoung man expressed his gladness to see his host downstairs.\n\n‘Oh yes; I knew I should soon be right again. I have not made the\nacquaintance of gout for more than two years, and it generally goes off\nthe second night. Well, where have you been this morning? I saw you come\nin just now, I think!’\n\n‘Yes; I have been for a walk.’\n\n‘Start early?’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘Very early, I think?’\n\n‘Yes, it was rather early.’\n\n‘Which way did you go? To the sea, I suppose. Everybody goes seaward.’\n\n‘No; I followed up the river as far as the park wall.’\n\n‘You are different from your kind. Well, I suppose such a wild place is\na novelty, and so tempted you out of bed?’\n\n‘Not altogether a novelty. I like it.’\n\nThe youth seemed averse to explanation.\n\n‘You must, you must; to go cock-watching the morning after a journey of\nfourteen or sixteen hours. But there’s no accounting for tastes, and\nI am glad to see that yours are no meaner. After breakfast, but not\nbefore, I shall be good for a ten miles’ walk, Master Smith.’\n\nCertainly there seemed nothing exaggerated in that assertion. Mr.\nSwancourt by daylight showed himself to be a man who, in common with\nthe other two people under his roof, had really strong claims to be\nconsidered handsome,--handsome, that is, in the sense in which the moon\nis bright: the ravines and valleys which, on a close inspection, are\nseen to diversify its surface being left out of the argument. His face\nwas of a tint that never deepened upon his cheeks nor lightened upon\nhis forehead, but remained uniform throughout; the usual neutral\nsalmon-colour of a man who feeds well--not to say too well--and does not\nthink hard; every pore being in visible working order. His tout ensemble\nwas that of a highly improved class of farmer, dressed up in the wrong\nclothes; that of a firm-standing perpendicular man, whose fall would\nhave been backwards in direction if he had ever lost his balance.\n\nThe vicar’s background was at present what a vicar’s background should\nbe, his study. Here the consistency ends. All along the chimneypiece\nwere ranged bottles of horse, pig, and cow medicines, and against the\nwall was a high table, made up of the fragments of an old oak Iychgate.\nUpon this stood stuffed specimens of owls, divers, and gulls, and over\nthem bunches of wheat and barley ears, labelled with the date of the\nyear that produced them. Some cases and shelves, more or less laden\nwith books, the prominent titles of which were Dr. Brown’s ‘Notes on\nthe Romans,’ Dr. Smith’s ‘Notes on the Corinthians,’ and Dr. Robinson’s\n‘Notes on the Galatians, Ephesians, and Philippians,’ just saved the\ncharacter of the place, in spite of a girl’s doll’s-house standing above\nthem, a marine aquarium in the window, and Elfride’s hat hanging on its\ncorner.\n\n‘Business, business!’ said Mr. Swancourt after breakfast. He began to\nfind it necessary to act the part of a fly-wheel towards the somewhat\nirregular forces of his visitor.\n\nThey prepared to go to the church; the vicar, on second thoughts,\nmounting his coal-black mare to avoid exerting his foot too much at\nstarting. Stephen said he should want a man to assist him. ‘Worm!’ the\nvicar shouted.\n\nA minute or two after a voice was heard round the corner of the\nbuilding, mumbling, ‘Ah, I used to be strong enough, but ‘tis altered\nnow! Well, there, I’m as independent as one here and there, even if they\ndo write ‘squire after their names.’\n\n‘What’s the matter?’ said the vicar, as William Worm appeared; when the\nremarks were repeated to him.\n\n‘Worm says some very true things sometimes,’ Mr. Swancourt said, turning\nto Stephen. ‘Now, as regards that word “esquire.” Why, Mr. Smith,\nthat word “esquire” is gone to the dogs,--used on the letters of every\njackanapes who has a black coat. Anything else, Worm?’\n\n‘Ay, the folk have begun frying again!’\n\n‘Dear me! I’m sorry to hear that.’\n\n‘Yes,’ Worm said groaningly to Stephen, ‘I’ve got such a noise in my\nhead that there’s no living night nor day. ‘Tis just for all the world\nlike people frying fish: fry, fry, fry, all day long in my poor head,\ntill I don’t know whe’r I’m here or yonder. There, God A’mighty will\nfind it out sooner or later, I hope, and relieve me.’\n\n‘Now, my deafness,’ said Mr. Swancourt impressively, ‘is a dead silence;\nbut William Worm’s is that of people frying fish in his head. Very\nremarkable, isn’t it?’\n\n‘I can hear the frying-pan a-fizzing as naterel as life,’ said Worm\ncorroboratively.\n\n‘Yes, it is remarkable,’ said Mr. Smith.\n\n‘Very peculiar, very peculiar,’ echoed the vicar; and they all then\nfollowed the path up the hill, bounded on each side by a little stone\nwall, from which gleamed fragments of quartz and blood-red marbles,\napparently of inestimable value, in their setting of brown alluvium.\nStephen walked with the dignity of a man close to the horse’s head, Worm\nstumbled along a stone’s throw in the rear, and Elfride was nowhere\nin particular, yet everywhere; sometimes in front, sometimes behind,\nsometimes at the sides, hovering about the procession like a butterfly;\nnot definitely engaged in travelling, yet somehow chiming in at points\nwith the general progress.\n\nThe vicar explained things as he went on: ‘The fact is, Mr. Smith,\nI didn’t want this bother of church restoration at all, but it\nwas necessary to do something in self-defence, on account of those\nd----dissenters: I use the word in its scriptural meaning, of course,\nnot as an expletive.’\n\n‘How very odd!’ said Stephen, with the concern demanded of serious\nfriendliness.\n\n‘Odd? That’s nothing to how it is in the parish of Twinkley. Both the\nchurchwardens are----; there, I won’t say what they are; and the clerk\nand the sexton as well.’\n\n‘How very strange!’ said Stephen.\n\n‘Strange? My dear sir, that’s nothing to how it is in the parish of\nSinnerton. However, as to our own parish, I hope we shall make some\nprogress soon.’\n\n‘You must trust to circumstances.’\n\n‘There are no circumstances to trust to. We may as well trust in\nProvidence if we trust at all. But here we are. A wild place, isn’t it?\nBut I like it on such days as these.’\n\nThe churchyard was entered on this side by a stone stile, over which\nhaving clambered, you remained still on the wild hill, the within not\nbeing so divided from the without as to obliterate the sense of open\nfreedom. A delightful place to be buried in, postulating that delight\ncan accompany a man to his tomb under any circumstances. There was\nnothing horrible in this churchyard, in the shape of tight mounds bonded\nwith sticks, which shout imprisonment in the ears rather than whisper\nrest; or trim garden-flowers, which only raise images of people in new\nblack crape and white handkerchiefs coming to tend them; or wheel-marks,\nwhich remind us of hearses and mourning coaches; or cypress-bushes,\nwhich make a parade of sorrow; or coffin-boards and bones lying behind\ntrees, showing that we are only leaseholders of our graves. No; nothing\nbut long, wild, untutored grass, diversifying the forms of the mounds\nit covered,--themselves irregularly shaped, with no eye to effect; the\nimpressive presence of the old mountain that all this was a part of\nbeing nowhere excluded by disguising art. Outside were similar slopes\nand similar grass; and then the serene impassive sea, visible to a\nwidth of half the horizon, and meeting the eye with the effect of a\nvast concave, like the interior of a blue vessel. Detached rocks stood\nupright afar, a collar of foam girding their bases, and repeating in its\nwhiteness the plumage of a countless multitude of gulls that restlessly\nhovered about.\n\n‘Now, Worm!’ said Mr. Swancourt sharply; and Worm started into an\nattitude of attention at once to receive orders. Stephen and himself\nwere then left in possession, and the work went on till early in the\nafternoon, when dinner was announced by Unity of the vicarage kitchen\nrunning up the hill without a bonnet.\n\n\nElfride did not make her appearance inside the building till late in\nthe afternoon, and came then by special invitation from Stephen during\ndinner. She looked so intensely LIVING and full of movement as she came\ninto the old silent place, that young Smith’s world began to be lit\nby ‘the purple light’ in all its definiteness. Worm was got rid of by\nsending him to measure the height of the tower.\n\nWhat could she do but come close--so close that a minute arc of her\nskirt touched his foot--and asked him how he was getting on with\nhis sketches, and set herself to learn the principles of practical\nmensuration as applied to irregular buildings? Then she must ascend the\npulpit to re-imagine for the hundredth time how it would seem to be a\npreacher.\n\nPresently she leant over the front of the pulpit.\n\n‘Don’t you tell papa, will you, Mr. Smith, if I tell you something?’ she\nsaid with a sudden impulse to make a confidence.\n\n‘Oh no, that I won’t,’ said he, staring up.\n\n‘Well, I write papa’s sermons for him very often, and he preaches them\nbetter than he does his own; and then afterwards he talks to people and\nto me about what he said in his sermon to-day, and forgets that I wrote\nit for him. Isn’t it absurd?’\n\n‘How clever you must be!’ said Stephen. ‘I couldn’t write a sermon for\nthe world.’\n\n‘Oh, it’s easy enough,’ she said, descending from the pulpit and coming\nclose to him to explain more vividly. ‘You do it like this. Did you ever\nplay a game of forfeits called “When is it? where is it? what is it?”’\n\n‘No, never.’\n\n‘Ah, that’s a pity, because writing a sermon is very much like playing\nthat game. You take the text. You think, why is it? what is it? and so\non. You put that down under “Generally.” Then you proceed to the First,\nSecondly, and Thirdly. Papa won’t have Fourthlys--says they are all my\neye. Then you have a final Collectively, several pages of this being\nput in great black brackets, writing opposite, “LEAVE THIS OUT IF THE\nFARMERS ARE FALLING ASLEEP.” Then comes your In Conclusion, then A Few\nWords And I Have Done. Well, all this time you have put on the back\nof each page, “KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN”--I mean,’ she added, correcting\nherself, ‘that’s how I do in papa’s sermon-book, because otherwise he\ngets louder and louder, till at last he shouts like a farmer up a-field.\nOh, papa is so funny in some things!’\n\nThen, after this childish burst of confidence, she was frightened, as if\nwarned by womanly instinct, which for the moment her ardour had outrun,\nthat she had been too forward to a comparative stranger.\n\nElfride saw her father then, and went away into the wind, being caught\nby a gust as she ascended the churchyard slope, in which gust she had\nthe motions, without the motives, of a hoiden; the grace, without the\nself-consciousness, of a pirouetter. She conversed for a minute or two\nwith her father, and proceeded homeward, Mr. Swancourt coming on to\nthe church to Stephen. The wind had freshened his warm complexion as it\nfreshens the glow of a brand. He was in a mood of jollity, and watched\nElfride down the hill with a smile.\n\n‘You little flyaway! you look wild enough now,’ he said, and turned to\nStephen. ‘But she’s not a wild child at all, Mr. Smith. As steady as\nyou; and that you are steady I see from your diligence here.’\n\n‘I think Miss Swancourt very clever,’ Stephen observed.\n\n‘Yes, she is; certainly, she is,’ said papa, turning his voice as much\nas possible to the neutral tone of disinterested criticism. ‘Now, Smith,\nI’ll tell you something; but she mustn’t know it for the world--not for\nthe world, mind, for she insists upon keeping it a dead secret. Why, SHE\nWRITES MY SERMONS FOR ME OFTEN, and a very good job she makes of them!’\n\n‘She can do anything.’\n\n‘She can do that. The little rascal has the very trick of the trade.\nBut, mind you, Smith, not a word about it to her, not a single word!’\n\n‘Not a word,’ said Smith.\n\n‘Look there,’ said Mr. Swancourt. ‘What do you think of my roofing?’ He\npointed with his walking-stick at the chancel roof,\n\n‘Did you do that, sir?’\n\n‘Yes, I worked in shirt-sleeves all the time that was going on. I pulled\ndown the old rafters, fixed the new ones, put on the battens, slated\nthe roof, all with my own hands, Worm being my assistant. We worked like\nslaves, didn’t we, Worm?’\n\n‘Ay, sure, we did; harder than some here and there--hee, hee!’ said\nWilliam Worm, cropping up from somewhere. ‘Like slaves, ‘a b’lieve--hee,\nhee! And weren’t ye foaming mad, sir, when the nails wouldn’t go\nstraight? Mighty I! There, ‘tisn’t so bad to cuss and keep it in as to\ncuss and let it out, is it, sir?’\n\n‘Well--why?’\n\n‘Because you, sir, when ye were a-putting on the roof, only used to cuss\nin your mind, which is, I suppose, no harm at all.’\n\n‘I don’t think you know what goes on in my mind, Worm.’\n\n‘Oh, doan’t I, sir--hee, hee! Maybe I’m but a poor wambling thing, sir,\nand can’t read much; but I can spell as well as some here and there.\nDoan’t ye mind, sir, that blustrous night when ye asked me to hold the\ncandle to ye in yer workshop, when you were making a new chair for the\nchancel?’\n\n‘Yes; what of that?’\n\n‘I stood with the candle, and you said you liked company, if ‘twas only\na dog or cat--maning me; and the chair wouldn’t do nohow.’\n\n‘Ah, I remember.’\n\n‘No; the chair wouldn’t do nohow. ‘A was very well to look at; but,\nLord!----’\n\n‘Worm, how often have I corrected you for irreverent speaking?’\n\n‘--‘A was very well to look at, but you couldn’t sit in the chair nohow.\n‘Twas all a-twist wi’ the chair, like the letter Z, directly you sat\ndown upon the chair. “Get up, Worm,” says you, when you seed the chair\ngo all a-sway wi’ me. Up you took the chair, and flung en like fire\nand brimstone to t’other end of your shop--all in a passion. “Damn the\nchair!” says I. “Just what I was thinking,” says you, sir. “I could see\nit in your face, sir,” says I, “and I hope you and God will forgi’e\nme for saying what you wouldn’t.” To save your life you couldn’t help\nlaughing, sir, at a poor wambler reading your thoughts so plain. Ay, I’m\nas wise as one here and there.’\n\n‘I thought you had better have a practical man to go over the church and\ntower with you,’ Mr. Swancourt said to Stephen the following morning,\n‘so I got Lord Luxellian’s permission to send for a man when you came. I\ntold him to be there at ten o’clock. He’s a very intelligent man, and\nhe will tell you all you want to know about the state of the walls. His\nname is John Smith.’\n\nElfride did not like to be seen again at the church with Stephen. ‘I\nwill watch here for your appearance at the top of the tower,’ she said\nlaughingly. ‘I shall see your figure against the sky.’\n\n‘And when I am up there I’ll wave my handkerchief to you, Miss\nSwancourt,’ said Stephen. ‘In twelve minutes from this present moment,’\nhe added, looking at his watch, ‘I’ll be at the summit and look out for\nyou.’\n\nShe went round to the corner of the shrubbery, whence she could watch\nhim down the slope leading to the foot of the hill on which the church\nstood. There she saw waiting for him a white spot--a mason in his\nworking clothes. Stephen met this man and stopped.\n\nTo her surprise, instead of their moving on to the churchyard, they\nboth leisurely sat down upon a stone close by their meeting-place, and\nremained as if in deep conversation. Elfride looked at the time; nine\nof the twelve minutes had passed, and Stephen showed no signs of moving.\nMore minutes passed--she grew cold with waiting, and shivered. It was\nnot till the end of a quarter of an hour that they began to slowly wend\nup the hill at a snail’s pace.\n\n‘Rude and unmannerly!’ she said to herself, colouring with pique.\n‘Anybody would think he was in love with that horrid mason instead of\nwith----’\n\nThe sentence remained unspoken, though not unthought.\n\nShe returned to the porch.\n\n‘Is the man you sent for a lazy, sit-still, do-nothing kind of man?’ she\ninquired of her father.\n\n‘No,’ he said surprised; ‘quite the reverse. He is Lord Luxellian’s\nmaster-mason, John Smith.’\n\n‘Oh,’ said Elfride indifferently, and returned towards her bleak\nstation, and waited and shivered again. It was a trifle, after all--a\nchildish thing--looking out from a tower and waving a handkerchief. But\nher new friend had promised, and why should he tease her so? The effect\nof a blow is as proportionate to the texture of the object struck as\nto its own momentum; and she had such a superlative capacity for being\nwounded that little hits struck her hard.\n\nIt was not till the end of half an hour that two figures were seen above\nthe parapet of the dreary old pile, motionless as bitterns on a ruined\nmosque. Even then Stephen was not true enough to perform what he was so\ncourteous to promise, and he vanished without making a sign.\n\nHe returned at midday. Elfride looked vexed when unconscious that his\neyes were upon her; when conscious, severe. However, her attitude of\ncoldness had long outlived the coldness itself, and she could no longer\nutter feigned words of indifference.\n\n‘Ah, you weren’t kind to keep me waiting in the cold, and break your\npromise,’ she said at last reproachfully, in tones too low for her\nfather’s powers of hearing.\n\n‘Forgive, forgive me!’ said Stephen with dismay. ‘I had forgotten--quite\nforgotten! Something prevented my remembering.’\n\n‘Any further explanation?’ said Miss Capricious, pouting.\n\nHe was silent for a few minutes, and looked askance.\n\n‘None,’ he said, with the accent of one who concealed a sin.\n\n\n\n\nChapter V\n\n     ‘Bosom’d high in tufted trees.’\n\n\nIt was breakfast time.\n\nAs seen from the vicarage dining-room, which took a warm tone of light\nfrom the fire, the weather and scene outside seemed to have stereotyped\nthemselves in unrelieved shades of gray. The long-armed trees and shrubs\nof juniper, cedar, and pine varieties, were grayish black; those of the\nbroad-leaved sort, together with the herbage, were grayish-green;\nthe eternal hills and tower behind them were grayish-brown; the sky,\ndropping behind all, gray of the purest melancholy.\n\nYet in spite of this sombre artistic effect, the morning was not one\nwhich tended to lower the spirits. It was even cheering. For it did not\nrain, nor was rain likely to fall for many days to come.\n\nElfride had turned from the table towards the fire and was idly\nelevating a hand-screen before her face, when she heard the click of a\nlittle gate outside.\n\n‘Ah, here’s the postman!’ she said, as a shuffling, active man came\nthrough an opening in the shrubbery and across the lawn. She vanished,\nand met him in the porch, afterwards coming in with her hands behind her\nback.\n\n‘How many are there? Three for papa, one for Mr. Smith, none for Miss\nSwancourt. And, papa, look here, one of yours is from--whom do you\nthink?--Lord Luxellian. And it has something HARD in it--a lump of\nsomething. I’ve been feeling it through the envelope, and can’t think\nwhat it is.’\n\n‘What does Luxellian write for, I wonder?’ Mr. Swancourt had said\nsimultaneously with her words. He handed Stephen his letter, and took\nhis own, putting on his countenance a higher class of look than was\ncustomary, as became a poor gentleman who was going to read a letter\nfrom a peer.\n\nStephen read his missive with a countenance quite the reverse of the\nvicar’s.\n\n\n                 ‘PERCY PLACE, Thursday Evening.\n‘DEAR SMITH,--Old H. is in a towering rage with you for being so long\nabout the church sketches. Swears you are more trouble than you are\nworth. He says I am to write and say you are to stay no longer on\nany consideration--that he would have done it all in three hours very\neasily. I told him that you were not like an experienced hand, which he\nseemed to forget, but it did not make much difference. However, between\nyou and me privately, if I were you I would not alarm myself for a day\nor so, if I were not inclined to return. I would make out the week and\nfinish my spree. He will blow up just as much if you appear here on\nSaturday as if you keep away till Monday morning.--Yours very truly,\n\n‘SIMPKINS JENKINS.\n\n\n\n‘Dear me--very awkward!’ said Stephen, rather en l’air, and confused\nwith the kind of confusion that assails an understrapper when he has\nbeen enlarged by accident to the dimensions of a superior, and is\nsomewhat rudely pared down to his original size.\n\n‘What is awkward?’ said Miss Swancourt.\n\nSmith by this time recovered his equanimity, and with it the\nprofessional dignity of an experienced architect.\n\n‘Important business demands my immediate presence in London, I regret to\nsay,’ he replied.\n\n‘What! Must you go at once?’ said Mr. Swancourt, looking over the edge\nof his letter. ‘Important business? A young fellow like you to have\nimportant business!’\n\n‘The truth is,’ said Stephen blushing, and rather ashamed of having\npretended even so slightly to a consequence which did not belong to\nhim,--‘the truth is, Mr. Hewby has sent to say I am to come home; and I\nmust obey him.’\n\n‘I see; I see. It is politic to do so, you mean. Now I can see more than\nyou think. You are to be his partner. I booked you for that directly\nI read his letter to me the other day, and the way he spoke of you. He\nthinks a great deal of you, Mr. Smith, or he wouldn’t be so anxious for\nyour return.’\n\nUnpleasant to Stephen such remarks as these could not sound; to have the\nexpectancy of partnership with one of the largest-practising architects\nin London thrust upon him was cheering, however untenable he felt the\nidea to be. He saw that, whatever Mr. Hewby might think, Mr. Swancourt\ncertainly thought much of him to entertain such an idea on such slender\nground as to be absolutely no ground at all. And then, unaccountably,\nhis speaking face exhibited a cloud of sadness, which a reflection on\nthe remoteness of any such contingency could hardly have sufficed to\ncause.\n\nElfride was struck with that look of his; even Mr. Swancourt noticed it.\n\n‘Well,’ he said cheerfully, ‘never mind that now. You must come again\non your own account; not on business. Come to see me as a visitor,\nyou know--say, in your holidays--all you town men have holidays like\nschoolboys. When are they?’\n\n‘In August, I believe.’\n\n‘Very well; come in August; and then you need not hurry away so. I am\nglad to get somebody decent to talk to, or at, in this outlandish ultima\nThule. But, by the bye, I have something to say--you won’t go to-day?’\n\n‘No; I need not,’ said Stephen hesitatingly. ‘I am not obliged to get\nback before Monday morning.’\n\n‘Very well, then, that brings me to what I am going to propose. This is\na letter from Lord Luxellian. I think you heard me speak of him as the\nresident landowner in this district, and patron of this living?’\n\n‘I--know of him.’\n\n‘He is in London now. It seems that he has run up on business for a day\nor two, and taken Lady Luxellian with him. He has written to ask me to\ngo to his house, and search for a paper among his private memoranda,\nwhich he forgot to take with him.’\n\n‘What did he send in the letter?’ inquired Elfride.\n\n‘The key of a private desk in which the papers are. He doesn’t like to\ntrust such a matter to any body else. I have done such things for him\nbefore. And what I propose is, that we make an afternoon of it--all\nthree of us. Go for a drive to Targan Bay, come home by way of Endelstow\nHouse; and whilst I am looking over the documents you can ramble about\nthe rooms where you like. I have the run of the house at any time, you\nknow. The building, though nothing but a mass of gables outside, has a\nsplendid hall, staircase, and gallery within; and there are a few good\npictures.’\n\n‘Yes, there are,’ said Stephen.\n\n‘Have you seen the place, then?\n\n‘I saw it as I came by,’ he said hastily.\n\n‘Oh yes; but I was alluding to the interior. And the church--St.\nEval’s--is much older than our St. Agnes’ here. I do duty in that and\nthis alternately, you know. The fact is, I ought to have some help;\nriding across that park for two miles on a wet morning is not at all\nthe thing. If my constitution were not well seasoned, as thank God it\nis,’--here Mr. Swancourt looked down his front, as if his constitution\nwere visible there,--‘I should be coughing and barking all the year\nround. And when the family goes away, there are only about three\nservants to preach to when I get there. Well, that shall be the\narrangement, then. Elfride, you will like to go?’\n\nElfride assented; and the little breakfast-party separated. Stephen\nrose to go and take a few final measurements at the church, the vicar\nfollowing him to the door with a mysterious expression of inquiry on his\nface.\n\n‘You’ll put up with our not having family prayer this morning, I hope?’\nhe whispered.\n\n‘Yes; quite so,’ said Stephen.\n\n‘To tell you the truth,’ he continued in the same undertone, ‘we don’t\nmake a regular thing of it; but when we have strangers visiting us, I am\nstrongly of opinion that it is the proper thing to do, and I always do\nit. I am very strict on that point. But you, Smith, there is something\nin your face which makes me feel quite at home; no nonsense about you,\nin short. Ah, it reminds me of a splendid story I used to hear when I\nwas a helter-skelter young fellow--such a story! But’--here the vicar\nshook his head self-forbiddingly, and grimly laughed.\n\n‘Was it a good story?’ said young Smith, smiling too.\n\n‘Oh yes; but ‘tis too bad--too bad! Couldn’t tell it to you for the\nworld!’\n\nStephen went across the lawn, hearing the vicar chuckling privately at\nthe recollection as he withdrew.\n\n\nThey started at three o’clock. The gray morning had resolved itself\ninto an afternoon bright with a pale pervasive sunlight, without the\nsun itself being visible. Lightly they trotted along--the wheels nearly\nsilent, the horse’s hoofs clapping, almost ringing, upon the hard,\nwhite, turnpike road as it followed the level ridge in a perfectly\nstraight line, seeming to be absorbed ultimately by the white of the\nsky.\n\nTargan Bay--which had the merit of being easily got at--was duly\nvisited. They then swept round by innumerable lanes, in which not twenty\nconsecutive yards were either straight or level, to the domain of Lord\nLuxellian. A woman with a double chin and thick neck, like Queen Anne by\nDahl, threw open the lodge gate, a little boy standing behind her.\n\n‘I’ll give him something, poor little fellow,’ said Elfride, pulling out\nher purse and hastily opening it. From the interior of her purse a host\nof bits of paper, like a flock of white birds, floated into the air, and\nwere blown about in all directions.\n\n‘Well, to be sure!’ said Stephen with a slight laugh.\n\n‘What the dickens is all that?’ said Mr. Swancourt. ‘Not halves of\nbank-notes, Elfride?’\n\nElfride looked annoyed and guilty. ‘They are only something of mine,\npapa,’ she faltered, whilst Stephen leapt out, and, assisted by the\nlodge-keeper’s little boy, crept about round the wheels and horse’s\nhoofs till the papers were all gathered together again. He handed them\nback to her, and remounted.\n\n‘I suppose you are wondering what those scraps were?’ she said, as they\nbowled along up the sycamore avenue. ‘And so I may as well tell you.\nThey are notes for a romance I am writing.’\n\nShe could not help colouring at the confession, much as she tried to\navoid it.\n\n‘A story, do you mean?’ said Stephen, Mr. Swancourt half listening, and\ncatching a word of the conversation now and then.\n\n‘Yes; THE COURT OF KELLYON CASTLE; a romance of the fifteenth century.\nSuch writing is out of date now, I know; but I like doing it.’\n\n‘A romance carried in a purse! If a highwayman were to rob you, he would\nbe taken in.’\n\n‘Yes; that’s my way of carrying manuscript. The real reason is, that I\nmostly write bits of it on scraps of paper when I am on horseback; and I\nput them there for convenience.’\n\n‘What are you going to do with your romance when you have written it?’\nsaid Stephen.\n\n‘I don’t know,’ she replied, and turned her head to look at the\nprospect.\n\nFor by this time they had reached the precincts of Endelstow House.\nDriving through an ancient gate-way of dun-coloured stone, spanned by\nthe high-shouldered Tudor arch, they found themselves in a spacious\ncourt, closed by a facade on each of its three sides. The substantial\nportions of the existing building dated from the reign of Henry VIII.;\nbut the picturesque and sheltered spot had been the site of an erection\nof a much earlier date. A licence to crenellate mansum infra manerium\nsuum was granted by Edward II. to ‘Hugo Luxellen chivaler;’ but though\nthe faint outline of the ditch and mound was visible at points, no sign\nof the original building remained.\n\nThe windows on all sides were long and many-mullioned; the roof lines\nbroken up by dormer lights of the same pattern. The apex stones of these\ndormers, together with those of the gables, were surmounted by grotesque\nfigures in rampant, passant, and couchant variety. Tall octagonal and\ntwisted chimneys thrust themselves high up into the sky, surpassed in\nheight, however, by some poplars and sycamores at the back, which showed\ntheir gently rocking summits over ridge and parapet. In the corners\nof the court polygonal bays, whose surfaces were entirely occupied by\nbuttresses and windows, broke into the squareness of the enclosure; and\na far-projecting oriel, springing from a fantastic series of mouldings,\noverhung the archway of the chief entrance to the house.\n\nAs Mr. Swancourt had remarked, he had the freedom of the mansion in\nthe absence of its owner. Upon a statement of his errand they were all\nadmitted to the library, and left entirely to themselves. Mr. Swancourt\nwas soon up to his eyes in the examination of a heap of papers he had\ntaken from the cabinet described by his correspondent. Stephen and\nElfride had nothing to do but to wander about till her father was ready.\n\nElfride entered the gallery, and Stephen followed her without seeming to\ndo so. It was a long sombre apartment, enriched with fittings a century\nor so later in style than the walls of the mansion. Pilasters of\nRenaissance workmanship supported a cornice from which sprang a curved\nceiling, panelled in the awkward twists and curls of the period. The old\nGothic quarries still remained in the upper portion of the large window\nat the end, though they had made way for a more modern form of glazing\nelsewhere.\n\nStephen was at one end of the gallery looking towards Elfride, who stood\nin the midst, beginning to feel somewhat depressed by the society of\nLuxellian shades of cadaverous complexion fixed by Holbein, Kneller, and\nLely, and seeming to gaze at and through her in a moralizing mood. The\nsilence, which cast almost a spell upon them, was broken by the sudden\nopening of a door at the far end.\n\nOut bounded a pair of little girls, lightly yet warmly dressed. Their\neyes were sparkling; their hair swinging about and around; their red\nmouths laughing with unalloyed gladness.\n\n‘Ah, Miss Swancourt: dearest Elfie! we heard you. Are you going to stay\nhere? You are our little mamma, are you not--our big mamma is gone to\nLondon,’ said one.\n\n‘Let me tiss you,’ said the other, in appearance very much like the\nfirst, but to a smaller pattern.\n\nTheir pink cheeks and yellow hair were speedily intermingled with the\nfolds of Elfride’s dress; she then stooped and tenderly embraced them\nboth.\n\n‘Such an odd thing,’ said Elfride, smiling, and turning to Stephen.\n‘They have taken it into their heads lately to call me “little mamma,”\n because I am very fond of them, and wore a dress the other day something\nlike one of Lady Luxellian’s.’\n\nThese two young creatures were the Honourable Mary and the Honourable\nKate--scarcely appearing large enough as yet to bear the weight of such\nponderous prefixes. They were the only two children of Lord and Lady\nLuxellian, and, as it proved, had been left at home during their\nparents’ temporary absence, in the custody of nurse and governess. Lord\nLuxellian was dotingly fond of the children; rather indifferent towards\nhis wife, since she had begun to show an inclination not to please him\nby giving him a boy.\n\nAll children instinctively ran after Elfride, looking upon her more as\nan unusually nice large specimen of their own tribe than as a grown-up\nelder. It had now become an established rule, that whenever she met\nthem--indoors or out-of-doors, weekdays or Sundays--they were to be\nseverally pressed against her face and bosom for the space of a quarter\nof a minute, and other-wise made much of on the delightful system\nof cumulative epithet and caress to which unpractised girls will\noccasionally abandon themselves.\n\nA look of misgiving by the youngsters towards the door by which they\nhad entered directed attention to a maid-servant appearing from the same\nquarter, to put an end to this sweet freedom of the poor Honourables\nMary and Kate.\n\n‘I wish you lived here, Miss Swancourt,’ piped one like a melancholy\nbullfinch.\n\n‘So do I,’ piped the other like a rather more melancholy bullfinch.\n‘Mamma can’t play with us so nicely as you do. I don’t think she ever\nlearnt playing when she was little. When shall we come to see you?’\n\n‘As soon as you like, dears.’\n\n‘And sleep at your house all night? That’s what I mean by coming to\nsee you. I don’t care to see people with hats and bonnets on, and all\nstanding up and walking about.’\n\n‘As soon as we can get mamma’s permission you shall come and stay as\nlong as ever you like. Good-bye!’\n\nThe prisoners were then led off, Elfride again turning her attention to\nher guest, whom she had left standing at the remote end of the gallery.\nOn looking around for him he was nowhere to be seen. Elfride stepped\ndown to the library, thinking he might have rejoined her father there.\nBut Mr. Swancourt, now cheerfully illuminated by a pair of candles, was\nstill alone, untying packets of letters and papers, and tying them up\nagain.\n\nAs Elfride did not stand on a sufficiently intimate footing with the\nobject of her interest to justify her, as a proper young lady, to\ncommence the active search for him that youthful impulsiveness prompted,\nand as, nevertheless, for a nascent reason connected with those divinely\ncut lips of his, she did not like him to be absent from her side, she\nwandered desultorily back to the oak staircase, pouting and casting her\neyes about in hope of discerning his boyish figure.\n\nThough daylight still prevailed in the rooms, the corridors were in\na depth of shadow--chill, sad, and silent; and it was only by looking\nalong them towards light spaces beyond that anything or anybody could be\ndiscerned therein. One of these light spots she found to be caused by\na side-door with glass panels in the upper part. Elfride opened it, and\nfound herself confronting a secondary or inner lawn, separated from the\nprincipal lawn front by a shrubbery.\n\nAnd now she saw a perplexing sight. At right angles to the face of the\nwing she had emerged from, and within a few feet of the door, jutted\nout another wing of the mansion, lower and with less architectural\ncharacter. Immediately opposite to her, in the wall of this wing, was\na large broad window, having its blind drawn down, and illuminated by a\nlight in the room it screened.\n\nOn the blind was a shadow from somebody close inside it--a person in\nprofile. The profile was unmistakably that of Stephen. It was just\npossible to see that his arms were uplifted, and that his hands held an\narticle of some kind. Then another shadow appeared--also in profile--and\ncame close to him. This was the shadow of a woman. She turned her back\ntowards Stephen: he lifted and held out what now proved to be a shawl or\nmantle--placed it carefully--so carefully--round the lady; disappeared;\nreappeared in her front--fastened the mantle. Did he then kiss her?\nSurely not. Yet the motion might have been a kiss. Then both shadows\nswelled to colossal dimensions--grew distorted--vanished.\n\nTwo minutes elapsed.\n\n‘Ah, Miss Swancourt! I am so glad to find you. I was looking for\nyou,’ said a voice at her elbow--Stephen’s voice. She stepped into the\npassage.\n\n‘Do you know any of the members of this establishment?’ said she.\n\n‘Not a single one: how should I?’ he replied.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VI\n\n     ‘Fare thee weel awhile!’\n\n\nSimultaneously with the conclusion of Stephen’s remark, the sound of\nthe closing of an external door in their immediate neighbourhood reached\nElfride’s ears. It came from the further side of the wing containing the\nilluminated room. She then discerned, by the aid of the dusky departing\nlight, a figure, whose sex was undistinguishable, walking down the\ngravelled path by the parterre towards the river. The figure grew\nfainter, and vanished under the trees.\n\nMr. Swancourt’s voice was heard calling out their names from a distant\ncorridor in the body of the building. They retraced their steps, and\nfound him with his coat buttoned up and his hat on, awaiting their\nadvent in a mood of self-satisfaction at having brought his search to\na successful close. The carriage was brought round, and without further\ndelay the trio drove away from the mansion, under the echoing gateway\narch, and along by the leafless sycamores, as the stars began to kindle\ntheir trembling lights behind the maze of branches and twigs.\n\nNo words were spoken either by youth or maiden. Her unpractised mind was\ncompletely occupied in fathoming its recent acquisition. The young man\nwho had inspired her with such novelty of feeling, who had come directly\nfrom London on business to her father, having been brought by chance to\nEndelstow House had, by some means or other, acquired the privilege\nof approaching some lady he had found therein, and of honouring her by\npetits soins of a marked kind,--all in the space of half an hour.\n\nWhat room were they standing in? thought Elfride. As nearly as she could\nguess, it was Lord Luxellian’s business-room, or office. What people\nwere in the house? None but the governess and servants, as far as she\nknew, and of these he had professed a total ignorance. Had the person\nshe had indistinctly seen leaving the house anything to do with the\nperformance? It was impossible to say without appealing to the culprit\nhimself, and that she would never do. The more Elfride reflected, the\nmore certain did it appear that the meeting was a chance rencounter, and\nnot an appointment. On the ultimate inquiry as to the individuality of\nthe woman, Elfride at once assumed that she could not be an inferior.\nStephen Smith was not the man to care about passages-at-love with women\nbeneath him. Though gentle, ambition was visible in his kindling eyes;\nhe evidently hoped for much; hoped indefinitely, but extensively.\nElfride was puzzled, and being puzzled, was, by a natural sequence of\ngirlish sensations, vexed with him. No more pleasure came in recognizing\nthat from liking to attract him she was getting on to love him, boyish\nas he was and innocent as he had seemed.\n\nThey reached the bridge which formed a link between the eastern and\nwestern halves of the parish. Situated in a valley that was bounded\noutwardly by the sea, it formed a point of depression from which the\nroad ascended with great steepness to West Endelstow and the Vicarage.\nThere was no absolute necessity for either of them to alight, but as\nit was the vicar’s custom after a long journey to humour the horse in\nmaking this winding ascent, Elfride, moved by an imitative instinct,\nsuddenly jumped out when Pleasant had just begun to adopt the deliberate\nstalk he associated with this portion of the road.\n\nThe young man seemed glad of any excuse for breaking the silence. ‘Why,\nMiss Swancourt, what a risky thing to do!’ he exclaimed, immediately\nfollowing her example by jumping down on the other side.\n\n‘Oh no, not at all,’ replied she coldly; the shadow phenomenon at\nEndelstow House still paramount within her.\n\nStephen walked along by himself for two or three minutes, wrapped in the\nrigid reserve dictated by her tone. Then apparently thinking that it was\nonly for girls to pout, he came serenely round to her side, and offered\nhis arm with Castilian gallantry, to assist her in ascending the\nremaining three-quarters of the steep.\n\nHere was a temptation: it was the first time in her life that Elfride\nhad been treated as a grown-up woman in this way--offered an arm in a\nmanner implying that she had a right to refuse it. Till to-night she\nhad never received masculine attentions beyond those which might be\ncontained in such homely remarks as ‘Elfride, give me your hand;’\n‘Elfride, take hold of my arm,’ from her father. Her callow heart made\nan epoch of the incident; she considered her array of feelings, for and\nagainst. Collectively they were for taking this offered arm; the single\none of pique determined her to punish Stephen by refusing.\n\n‘No, thank you, Mr. Smith; I can get along better by myself’\n\nIt was Elfride’s first fragile attempt at browbeating a lover. Fearing\nmore the issue of such an undertaking than what a gentle young man\nmight think of her waywardness, she immediately afterwards determined to\nplease herself by reversing her statement.\n\n‘On second thoughts, I will take it,’ she said.\n\nThey slowly went their way up the hill, a few yards behind the carriage.\n\n‘How silent you are, Miss Swancourt!’ Stephen observed.\n\n‘Perhaps I think you silent too,’ she returned.\n\n‘I may have reason to be.’\n\n‘Scarcely; it is sadness that makes people silent, and you can have\nnone.’\n\n‘You don’t know: I have a trouble; though some might think it less a\ntrouble than a dilemma.’\n\n‘What is it?’ she asked impulsively.\n\nStephen hesitated. ‘I might tell,’ he said; ‘at the same time, perhaps,\nit is as well----’\n\nShe let go his arm and imperatively pushed it from her, tossing her\nhead. She had just learnt that a good deal of dignity is lost by asking\na question to which an answer is refused, even ever so politely;\nfor though politeness does good service in cases of requisition and\ncompromise, it but little helps a direct refusal. ‘I don’t wish to know\nanything of it; I don’t wish it,’ she went on. ‘The carriage is waiting\nfor us at the top of the hill; we must get in;’ and Elfride flitted\nto the front. ‘Papa, here is your Elfride!’ she exclaimed to the dusky\nfigure of the old gentleman, as she sprang up and sank by his side\nwithout deigning to accept aid from Stephen.\n\n‘Ah, yes!’ uttered the vicar in artificially alert tones, awaking from a\nmost profound sleep, and suddenly preparing to alight.\n\n‘Why, what are you doing, papa? We are not home yet.’\n\n‘Oh no, no; of course not; we are not at home yet,’ Mr. Swancourt said\nvery hastily, endeavouring to dodge back to his original position with\nthe air of a man who had not moved at all. ‘The fact is I was so lost in\ndeep meditation that I forgot whereabouts we were.’ And in a minute the\nvicar was snoring again.\n\n\nThat evening, being the last, seemed to throw an exceptional shade of\nsadness over Stephen Smith, and the repeated injunctions of the vicar,\nthat he was to come and revisit them in the summer, apparently tended\nless to raise his spirits than to unearth some misgiving.\n\nHe left them in the gray light of dawn, whilst the colours of earth were\nsombre, and the sun was yet hidden in the east. Elfride had fidgeted all\nnight in her little bed lest none of the household should be awake\nsoon enough to start him, and also lest she might miss seeing again\nthe bright eyes and curly hair, to which their owner’s possession of a\nhidden mystery added a deeper tinge of romance. To some extent--so\nsoon does womanly interest take a solicitous turn--she felt herself\nresponsible for his safe conduct. They breakfasted before daylight;\nMr. Swancourt, being more and more taken with his guest’s ingenuous\nappearance, having determined to rise early and bid him a friendly\nfarewell. It was, however, rather to the vicar’s astonishment, that he\nsaw Elfride walk in to the breakfast-table, candle in hand.\n\nWhilst William Worm performed his toilet (during which performance\nthe inmates of the vicarage were always in the habit of waiting with\nexemplary patience), Elfride wandered desultorily to the summer house.\nStephen followed her thither. The copse-covered valley was visible from\nthis position, a mist now lying all along its length, hiding the stream\nwhich trickled through it, though the observers themselves were in clear\nair.\n\nThey stood close together, leaning over the rustic balustrading which\nbounded the arbour on the outward side, and formed the crest of a steep\nslope beneath Elfride constrainedly pointed out some features of the\ndistant uplands rising irregularly opposite. But the artistic eye was,\neither from nature or circumstance, very faint in Stephen now, and he\nonly half attended to her description, as if he spared time from some\nother thought going on within him.\n\n‘Well, good-bye,’ he said suddenly; ‘I must never see you again, I\nsuppose, Miss Swancourt, in spite of invitations.’\n\nHis genuine tribulation played directly upon the delicate chords of\nher nature. She could afford to forgive him for a concealment or two.\nMoreover, the shyness which would not allow him to look her in the face\nlent bravery to her own eyes and tongue.\n\n‘Oh, DO come again, Mr. Smith!’ she said prettily.\n\n‘I should delight in it; but it will be better if I do not.’\n\n‘Why?’\n\n‘Certain circumstances in connection with me make it undesirable. Not on\nmy account; on yours.’\n\n‘Goodness! As if anything in connection with you could hurt me,’ she\nsaid with serene supremacy; but seeing that this plan of treatment was\ninappropriate, she tuned a smaller note. ‘Ah, I know why you will\nnot come. You don’t want to. You’ll go home to London and to all the\nstirring people there, and will never want to see us any more!’\n\n‘You know I have no such reason.’\n\n‘And go on writing letters to the lady you are engaged to, just as\nbefore.’\n\n‘What does that mean? I am not engaged.’\n\n‘You wrote a letter to a Miss Somebody; I saw it in the letter-rack.’\n\n‘Pooh! an elderly woman who keeps a stationer’s shop; and it was to tell\nher to keep my newspapers till I get back.’\n\n‘You needn’t have explained: it was not my business at all.’ Miss\nElfride was rather relieved to hear that statement, nevertheless. ‘And\nyou won’t come again to see my father?’ she insisted.\n\n‘I should like to--and to see you again, but----’\n\n‘Will you reveal to me that matter you hide?’ she interrupted\npetulantly.\n\n‘No; not now.’\n\nShe could not but go on, graceless as it might seem.\n\n‘Tell me this,’ she importuned with a trembling mouth. ‘Does any meeting\nof yours with a lady at Endelstow Vicarage clash with--any interest you\nmay take in me?’\n\nHe started a little. ‘It does not,’ he said emphatically; and looked\ninto the pupils of her eyes with the confidence that only honesty can\ngive, and even that to youth alone.\n\nThe explanation had not come, but a gloom left her. She could not but\nbelieve that utterance. Whatever enigma might lie in the shadow on the\nblind, it was not an enigma of underhand passion.\n\nShe turned towards the house, entering it through the conservatory.\nStephen went round to the front door. Mr. Swancourt was standing on the\nstep in his slippers. Worm was adjusting a buckle in the harness, and\nmurmuring about his poor head; and everything was ready for Stephen’s\ndeparture.\n\n‘You named August for your visit. August it shall be; that is, if you\ncare for the society of such a fossilized Tory,’ said Mr. Swancourt.\n\nMr. Smith only responded hesitatingly, that he should like to come\nagain.\n\n‘You said you would, and you must,’ insisted Elfride, coming to the door\nand speaking under her father’s arm.\n\nWhatever reason the youth may have had for not wishing to enter the\nhouse as a guest, it no longer predominated. He promised, and bade them\nadieu, and got into the pony-carriage, which crept up the slope, and\nbore him out of their sight.\n\n‘I never was so much taken with anybody in my life as I am with that\nyoung fellow--never! I cannot understand it--can’t understand it\nanyhow,’ said Mr. Swancourt quite energetically to himself; and went\nindoors.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VII\n\n     ‘No more of me you knew, my love!’\n\n\nStephen Smith revisited Endelstow Vicarage, agreeably to his promise. He\nhad a genuine artistic reason for coming, though no such reason\nseemed to be required. Six-and-thirty old seat ends, of exquisite\nfifteenth-century workmanship, were rapidly decaying in an aisle of\nthe church; and it became politic to make drawings of their worm-eaten\ncontours ere they were battered past recognition in the turmoil of the\nso-called restoration.\n\nHe entered the house at sunset, and the world was pleasant again to\nthe two fair-haired ones. A momentary pang of disappointment had,\nnevertheless, passed through Elfride when she casually discovered that\nhe had not come that minute post-haste from London, but had reached the\nneighbourhood the previous evening. Surprise would have accompanied the\nfeeling, had she not remembered that several tourists were haunting the\ncoast at this season, and that Stephen might have chosen to do likewise.\n\nThey did little besides chat that evening, Mr. Swancourt beginning to\nquestion his visitor, closely yet paternally, and in good part, on his\nhopes and prospects from the profession he had embraced. Stephen gave\nvague answers. The next day it rained. In the evening, when twenty-four\nhours of Elfride had completely rekindled her admirer’s ardour, a game\nof chess was proposed between them.\n\nThe game had its value in helping on the developments of their future.\n\nElfride soon perceived that her opponent was but a learner. She next\nnoticed that he had a very odd way of handling the pieces when castling\nor taking a man. Antecedently she would have supposed that the same\nperformance must be gone through by all players in the same manner; she\nwas taught by his differing action that all ordinary players, who learn\nthe game by sight, unconsciously touch the men in a stereotyped way.\nThis impression of indescribable oddness in Stephen’s touch culminated\nin speech when she saw him, at the taking of one of her bishops, push it\naside with the taking man instead of lifting it as a preliminary to the\nmove.\n\n‘How strangely you handle the men, Mr. Smith!’\n\n‘Do I? I am sorry for that.’\n\n‘Oh no--don’t be sorry; it is not a matter great enough for sorrow. But\nwho taught you to play?’\n\n‘Nobody, Miss Swancourt,’ he said. ‘I learnt from a book lent me by my\nfriend Mr. Knight, the noblest man in the world.’\n\n‘But you have seen people play?’\n\n‘I have never seen the playing of a single game. This is the first time\nI ever had the opportunity of playing with a living opponent. I have\nworked out many games from books, and studied the reasons of the\ndifferent moves, but that is all.’\n\nThis was a full explanation of his mannerism; but the fact that a man\nwith the desire for chess should have grown up without being able to\nsee or engage in a game astonished her not a little. She pondered on the\ncircumstance for some time, looking into vacancy and hindering the play.\n\nMr. Swancourt was sitting with his eyes fixed on the board, but\napparently thinking of other things. Half to himself he said, pending\nthe move of Elfride:\n\n‘“Quae finis aut quod me manet stipendium?”’\n\nStephen replied instantly:\n\n‘“Effare: jussas cum fide poenas luam.”’\n\n‘Excellent--prompt--gratifying!’ said Mr. Swancourt with feeling,\nbringing down his hand upon the table, and making three pawns and a\nknight dance over their borders by the shaking. ‘I was musing on those\nwords as applicable to a strange course I am steering--but enough of\nthat. I am delighted with you, Mr. Smith, for it is so seldom in this\ndesert that I meet with a man who is gentleman and scholar enough to\ncontinue a quotation, however trite it may be.’\n\n‘I also apply the words to myself,’ said Stephen quietly.\n\n‘You? The last man in the world to do that, I should have thought.’\n\n‘Come,’ murmured Elfride poutingly, and insinuating herself between\nthem, ‘tell me all about it. Come, construe, construe!’\n\nStephen looked steadfastly into her face, and said slowly, and in a\nvoice full of a far-off meaning that seemed quaintly premature in one so\nyoung:\n\n‘Quae finis WHAT WILL BE THE END, aut OR, quod stipendium WHAT FINE,\nmanet me AWAITS ME? Effare SPEAK OUT; luam I WILL PAY, cum fide WITH\nFAITH, jussas poenas THE PENALTY REQUIRED.’\n\nThe vicar, who had listened with a critical compression of the lips to\nthis school-boy recitation, and by reason of his imperfect hearing had\nmissed the marked realism of Stephen’s tone in the English words, now\nsaid hesitatingly: ‘By the bye, Mr. Smith (I know you’ll excuse my\ncuriosity), though your translation was unexceptionably correct and\nclose, you have a way of pronouncing your Latin which to me seems most\npeculiar. Not that the pronunciation of a dead language is of much\nimportance; yet your accents and quantities have a grotesque sound to\nmy ears. I thought first that you had acquired your way of breathing the\nvowels from some of the northern colleges; but it cannot be so with\nthe quantities. What I was going to ask was, if your instructor in the\nclassics could possibly have been an Oxford or Cambridge man?’\n\n‘Yes; he was an Oxford man--Fellow of St. Cyprian’s.’\n\n‘Really?’\n\n‘Oh yes; there’s no doubt about it.\n\n‘The oddest thing ever I heard of!’ said Mr. Swancourt, starting with\nastonishment. ‘That the pupil of such a man----’\n\n‘The best and cleverest man in England!’ cried Stephen enthusiastically.\n\n‘That the pupil of such a man should pronounce Latin in the way you\npronounce it beats all I ever heard. How long did he instruct you?’\n\n‘Four years.’\n\n‘Four years!’\n\n‘It is not so strange when I explain,’ Stephen hastened to say. ‘It was\ndone in this way--by letter. I sent him exercises and construing twice a\nweek, and twice a week he sent them back to me corrected, with marginal\nnotes of instruction. That is how I learnt my Latin and Greek, such as\nit is. He is not responsible for my scanning. He has never heard me scan\na line.’\n\n‘A novel case, and a singular instance of patience!’ cried the vicar.\n\n‘On his part, not on mine. Ah, Henry Knight is one in a thousand! I\nremember his speaking to me on this very subject of pronunciation. He\nsays that, much to his regret, he sees a time coming when every man will\npronounce even the common words of his own tongue as seems right in his\nown ears, and be thought none the worse for it; that the speaking age is\npassing away, to make room for the writing age.’\n\nBoth Elfride and her father had waited attentively to hear Stephen go on\nto what would have been the most interesting part of the story, namely,\nwhat circumstances could have necessitated such an unusual method of\neducation. But no further explanation was volunteered; and they saw, by\nthe young man’s manner of concentrating himself upon the chess-board,\nthat he was anxious to drop the subject.\n\nThe game proceeded. Elfride played by rote; Stephen by thought. It\nwas the cruellest thing to checkmate him after so much labour, she\nconsidered. What was she dishonest enough to do in her compassion?\nTo let him checkmate her. A second game followed; and being herself\nabsolutely indifferent as to the result (her playing was above the\naverage among women, and she knew it), she allowed him to give checkmate\nagain. A final game, in which she adopted the Muzio gambit as her\nopening, was terminated by Elfride’s victory at the twelfth move.\n\nStephen looked up suspiciously. His heart was throbbing even more\nexcitedly than was hers, which itself had quickened when she seriously\nset to work on this last occasion. Mr. Swancourt had left the room.\n\n‘You have been trifling with me till now!’ he exclaimed, his face\nflushing. ‘You did not play your best in the first two games?’\n\nElfride’s guilt showed in her face. Stephen became the picture of\nvexation and sadness, which, relishable for a moment, caused her the\nnext instant to regret the mistake she had made.\n\n‘Mr. Smith, forgive me!’ she said sweetly. ‘I see now, though I did not\nat first, that what I have done seems like contempt for your skill.\nBut, indeed, I did not mean it in that sense. I could not, upon my\nconscience, win a victory in those first and second games over one who\nfought at such a disadvantage and so manfully.’\n\nHe drew a long breath, and murmured bitterly, ‘Ah, you are cleverer than\nI. You can do everything--I can do nothing! O Miss Swancourt!’ he burst\nout wildly, his heart swelling in his throat, ‘I must tell you how I\nlove you! All these months of my absence I have worshipped you.’\n\nHe leapt from his seat like the impulsive lad that he was, slid round\nto her side, and almost before she suspected it his arm was round her\nwaist, and the two sets of curls intermingled.\n\nSo entirely new was full-blown love to Elfride, that she trembled as\nmuch from the novelty of the emotion as from the emotion itself. Then\nshe suddenly withdrew herself and stood upright, vexed that she had\nsubmitted unresistingly even to his momentary pressure. She resolved to\nconsider this demonstration as premature.\n\n‘You must not begin such things as those,’ she said with coquettish\nhauteur of a very transparent nature ‘And--you must not do so again--and\npapa is coming.’\n\n‘Let me kiss you--only a little one,’ he said with his usual delicacy,\nand without reading the factitiousness of her manner.\n\n‘No; not one.’\n\n‘Only on your cheek?’\n\n‘No.’\n\n‘Forehead?’\n\n‘Certainly not.’\n\n‘You care for somebody else, then? Ah, I thought so!’\n\n‘I am sure I do not.’\n\n‘Nor for me either?’\n\n‘How can I tell?’ she said simply, the simplicity lying merely in the\nbroad outlines of her manner and speech. There were the semitone of\nvoice and half-hidden expression of eyes which tell the initiated how\nvery fragile is the ice of reserve at these times.\n\nFootsteps were heard. Mr. Swancourt then entered the room, and their\nprivate colloquy ended.\n\nThe day after this partial revelation, Mr. Swancourt proposed a drive to\nthe cliffs beyond Targan Bay, a distance of three or four miles.\n\nHalf an hour before the time of departure a crash was heard in the back\nyard, and presently Worm came in, saying partly to the world in general,\npartly to himself, and slightly to his auditors:\n\n‘Ay, ay, sure! That frying of fish will be the end of William Worm. They\nbe at it again this morning--same as ever--fizz, fizz, fizz!’\n\n‘Your head bad again, Worm?’ said Mr. Swancourt. ‘What was that noise we\nheard in the yard?’\n\n‘Ay, sir, a weak wambling man am I; and the frying have been going on in\nmy poor head all through the long night and this morning as usual; and I\nwas so dazed wi’ it that down fell a piece of leg-wood across the shaft\nof the pony-shay, and splintered it off. “Ay,” says I, “I feel it as if\n‘twas my own shay; and though I’ve done it, and parish pay is my lot if\nI go from here, perhaps I am as independent as one here and there.”’\n\n‘Dear me, the shaft of the carriage broken!’ cried Elfride. She was\ndisappointed: Stephen doubly so. The vicar showed more warmth of temper\nthan the accident seemed to demand, much to Stephen’s uneasiness and\nrather to his surprise. He had not supposed so much latent sternness\ncould co-exist with Mr. Swancourt’s frankness and good-nature.\n\n‘You shall not be disappointed,’ said the vicar at length. ‘It is almost\ntoo long a distance for you to walk. Elfride can trot down on her pony,\nand you shall have my old nag, Smith.’\n\nElfride exclaimed triumphantly, ‘You have never seen me on\nhorseback--Oh, you must!’ She looked at Stephen and read his thoughts\nimmediately. ‘Ah, you don’t ride, Mr. Smith?’\n\n‘I am sorry to say I don’t.’\n\n‘Fancy a man not able to ride!’ said she rather pertly.\n\nThe vicar came to his rescue. ‘That’s common enough; he has had other\nlessons to learn. Now, I recommend this plan: let Elfride ride on\nhorseback, and you, Mr. Smith, walk beside her.’\n\nThe arrangement was welcomed with secret delight by Stephen. It seemed\nto combine in itself all the advantages of a long slow ramble with\nElfride, without the contingent possibility of the enjoyment being\nspoilt by her becoming weary. The pony was saddled and brought round.\n\n‘Now, Mr. Smith,’ said the lady imperatively, coming downstairs, and\nappearing in her riding-habit, as she always did in a change of dress,\nlike a new edition of a delightful volume, ‘you have a task to perform\nto-day. These earrings are my very favourite darling ones; but the worst\nof it is that they have such short hooks that they are liable to be\ndropped if I toss my head about much, and when I am riding I can’t give\nmy mind to them. It would be doing me knight service if you keep your\neyes fixed upon them, and remember them every minute of the day, and\ntell me directly I drop one. They have had such hairbreadth escapes,\nhaven’t they, Unity?’ she continued to the parlour-maid who was standing\nat the door.\n\n‘Yes, miss, that they have!’ said Unity with round-eyed commiseration.\n\n‘Once ‘twas in the lane that I found one of them,’ pursued Elfride\nreflectively.\n\n‘And then ‘twas by the gate into Eighteen Acres,’ Unity chimed in.\n\n‘And then ‘twas on the carpet in my own room,’ rejoined Elfride merrily.\n\n‘And then ‘twas dangling on the embroidery of your petticoat, miss; and\nthen ‘twas down your back, miss, wasn’t it? And oh, what a way you was\nin, miss, wasn’t you? my! until you found it!’\n\nStephen took Elfride’s slight foot upon his hand: ‘One, two, three, and\nup!’ she said.\n\nUnfortunately not so. He staggered and lifted, and the horse edged\nround; and Elfride was ultimately deposited upon the ground rather more\nforcibly than was pleasant. Smith looked all contrition.\n\n‘Never mind,’ said the vicar encouragingly; ‘try again! ‘Tis a little\naccomplishment that requires some practice, although it looks so easy.\nStand closer to the horse’s head, Mr. Smith.’\n\n‘Indeed, I shan’t let him try again,’ said she with a microscopic look\nof indignation. ‘Worm, come here, and help me to mount.’ Worm stepped\nforward, and she was in the saddle in a trice.\n\nThen they moved on, going for some distance in silence, the hot air of\nthe valley being occasionally brushed from their faces by a cool breeze,\nwhich wound its way along ravines leading up from the sea.\n\n‘I suppose,’ said Stephen, ‘that a man who can neither sit in a saddle\nhimself nor help another person into one seems a useless incumbrance;\nbut, Miss Swancourt, I’ll learn to do it all for your sake; I will,\nindeed.’\n\n‘What is so unusual in you,’ she said, in a didactic tone justifiable in\na horsewoman’s address to a benighted walker, ‘is that your knowledge of\ncertain things should be combined with your ignorance of certain other\nthings.’\n\nStephen lifted his eyes earnestly to hers.\n\n‘You know,’ he said, ‘it is simply because there are so many other\nthings to be learnt in this wide world that I didn’t trouble about that\nparticular bit of knowledge. I thought it would be useless to me; but\nI don’t think so now. I will learn riding, and all connected with it,\nbecause then you would like me better. Do you like me much less for\nthis?’\n\nShe looked sideways at him with critical meditation tenderly rendered.\n\n‘Do I seem like LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI?’ she began suddenly, without\nreplying to his question. ‘Fancy yourself saying, Mr. Smith:\n\n\n    “I sat her on my pacing steed,\n        And nothing else saw all day long,\n     For sidelong would she bend, and sing\n            A fairy’s song,\n   She found me roots of relish sweet,\n        And honey wild, and manna dew;”\n\n\nand that’s all she did.’\n\n‘No, no,’ said the young man stilly, and with a rising colour.\n\n\n\n  ‘“And sure in language strange she said,\n           I love thee true.”’\n\n\n\n‘Not at all,’ she rejoined quickly. ‘See how I can gallop. Now,\nPansy, off!’ And Elfride started; and Stephen beheld her light\nfigure contracting to the dimensions of a bird as she sank into the\ndistance--her hair flowing.\n\nHe walked on in the same direction, and for a considerable time could\nsee no signs of her returning. Dull as a flower without the sun he sat\ndown upon a stone, and not for fifteen minutes was any sound of horse\nor rider to be heard. Then Elfride and Pansy appeared on the hill in a\nround trot.\n\n‘Such a delightful scamper as we have had!’ she said, her face flushed\nand her eyes sparkling. She turned the horse’s head, Stephen arose, and\nthey went on again.\n\n‘Well, what have you to say to me, Mr. Smith, after my long absence?’\n\n‘Do you remember a question you could not exactly answer last\nnight--whether I was more to you than anybody else?’ said he.\n\n‘I cannot exactly answer now, either.’\n\n‘Why can’t you?’\n\n‘Because I don’t know if I am more to you than any one else.’\n\n‘Yes, indeed, you are!’ he exclaimed in a voice of intensest\nappreciation, at the same time gliding round and looking into her face.\n\n‘Eyes in eyes,’ he murmured playfully; and she blushingly obeyed,\nlooking back into his.\n\n‘And why not lips on lips?’ continued Stephen daringly.\n\n‘No, certainly not. Anybody might look; and it would be the death of me.\nYou may kiss my hand if you like.’\n\nHe expressed by a look that to kiss a hand through a glove, and that a\nriding-glove, was not a great treat under the circumstances.\n\n‘There, then; I’ll take my glove off. Isn’t it a pretty white hand? Ah,\nyou don’t want to kiss it, and you shall not now!’\n\n‘If I do not, may I never kiss again, you severe Elfride! You know I\nthink more of you than I can tell; that you are my queen. I would die\nfor you, Elfride!’\n\nA rapid red again filled her cheeks, and she looked at him meditatively.\nWhat a proud moment it was for Elfride then! She was ruling a heart with\nabsolute despotism for the first time in her life.\n\nStephen stealthily pounced upon her hand.\n\n‘No; I won’t, I won’t!’ she said intractably; ‘and you shouldn’t take me\nby surprise.’\n\nThere ensued a mild form of tussle for absolute possession of the\nmuch-coveted hand, in which the boisterousness of boy and girl was far\nmore prominent than the dignity of man and woman. Then Pansy became\nrestless. Elfride recovered her position and remembered herself.\n\n‘You make me behave in not a nice way at all!’ she exclaimed, in a tone\nneither of pleasure nor anger, but partaking of both. ‘I ought not to\nhave allowed such a romp! We are too old now for that sort of thing.’\n\n‘I hope you don’t think me too--too much of a creeping-round sort of\nman,’ said he in a penitent tone, conscious that he too had lost a\nlittle dignity by the proceeding.\n\n‘You are too familiar; and I can’t have it! Considering the shortness\nof the time we have known each other, Mr. Smith, you take too much upon\nyou. You think I am a country girl, and it doesn’t matter how you behave\nto me!’\n\n‘I assure you, Miss Swancourt, that I had no idea of freak in my mind. I\nwanted to imprint a sweet--serious kiss upon your hand; and that’s all.’\n\n‘Now, that’s creeping round again! And you mustn’t look into my eyes\nso,’ she said, shaking her head at him, and trotting on a few paces in\nadvance. Thus she led the way out of the lane and across some fields in\nthe direction of the cliffs. At the boundary of the fields nearest the\nsea she expressed a wish to dismount. The horse was tied to a post, and\nthey both followed an irregular path, which ultimately terminated upon\na flat ledge passing round the face of the huge blue-black rock at a\nheight about midway between the sea and the topmost verge. There, far\nbeneath and before them, lay the everlasting stretch of ocean; there,\nupon detached rocks, were the white screaming gulls, seeming ever\nintending to settle, and yet always passing on. Right and left ranked\nthe toothed and zigzag line of storm-torn heights, forming the series\nwhich culminated in the one beneath their feet.\n\nBehind the youth and maiden was a tempting alcove and seat, formed\nnaturally in the beetling mass, and wide enough to admit two or three\npersons. Elfride sat down, and Stephen sat beside her.\n\n‘I am afraid it is hardly proper of us to be here, either,’ she said\nhalf inquiringly. ‘We have not known each other long enough for this\nkind of thing, have we!’\n\n‘Oh yes,’ he replied judicially; ‘quite long enough.’\n\n‘How do you know?’\n\n‘It is not length of time, but the manner in which our minutes beat,\nthat makes enough or not enough in our acquaintanceship.’\n\n‘Yes, I see that. But I wish papa suspected or knew what a VERY NEW\nTHING I am doing. He does not think of it at all.’\n\n‘Darling Elfie, I wish we could be married! It is wrong for me to say\nit--I know it is--before you know more; but I wish we might be, all the\nsame. Do you love me deeply, deeply?’\n\n‘No!’ she said in a fluster.\n\nAt this point-blank denial, Stephen turned his face away decisively, and\npreserved an ominous silence; the only objects of interest on earth for\nhim being apparently the three or four-score sea-birds circling in the\nair afar off.\n\n‘I didn’t mean to stop you quite,’ she faltered with some alarm; and\nseeing that he still remained silent, she added more anxiously, ‘If you\nsay that again, perhaps, I will not be quite--quite so obstinate--if--if\nyou don’t like me to be.’\n\n‘Oh, my Elfride!’ he exclaimed, and kissed her.\n\nIt was Elfride’s first kiss. And so awkward and unused was she; full of\nstriving--no relenting. There was none of those apparent struggles to\nget out of the trap which only results in getting further in: no final\nattitude of receptivity: no easy close of shoulder to shoulder, hand\nupon hand, face upon face, and, in spite of coyness, the lips in the\nright place at the supreme moment. That graceful though apparently\naccidental falling into position, which many have noticed as\nprecipitating the end and making sweethearts the sweeter, was not here.\nWhy? Because experience was absent. A woman must have had many kisses\nbefore she kisses well.\n\nIn fact, the art of tendering the lips for these amatory salutes follows\nthe principles laid down in treatises on legerdemain for performing\nthe trick called Forcing a Card. The card is to be shifted nimbly,\nwithdrawn, edged under, and withal not to be offered till the moment the\nunsuspecting person’s hand reaches the pack; this forcing to be done so\nmodestly and yet so coaxingly, that the person trifled with imagines he\nis really choosing what is in fact thrust into his hand.\n\nWell, there were no such facilities now; and Stephen was conscious of\nit--first with a momentary regret that his kiss should be spoilt by her\nconfused receipt of it, and then with the pleasant perception that her\nawkwardness was her charm.\n\n‘And you do care for me and love me?’ said he.\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘Very much?’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘And I mustn’t ask you if you’ll wait for me, and be my wife some day?’\n\n‘Why not?’ she said naively.\n\n‘There is a reason why, my Elfride.’\n\n‘Not any one that I know of.’\n\n‘Suppose there is something connected with me which makes it almost\nimpossible for you to agree to be my wife, or for your father to\ncountenance such an idea?’\n\n‘Nothing shall make me cease to love you: no blemish can be found upon\nyour personal nature. That is pure and generous, I know; and having\nthat, how can I be cold to you?’\n\n‘And shall nothing else affect us--shall nothing beyond my nature be a\npart of my quality in your eyes, Elfie?’\n\n‘Nothing whatever,’ she said with a breath of relief. ‘Is that all? Some\noutside circumstance? What do I care?’\n\n‘You can hardly judge, dear, till you know what has to be judged. For\nthat, we will stop till we get home. I believe in you, but I cannot feel\nbright.’\n\n‘Love is new, and fresh to us as the dew; and we are together. As the\nlover’s world goes, this is a great deal. Stephen, I fancy I see the\ndifference between me and you--between men and women generally, perhaps.\nI am content to build happiness on any accidental basis that may lie\nnear at hand; you are for making a world to suit your happiness.’\n\n‘Elfride, you sometimes say things which make you seem suddenly to\nbecome five years older than you are, or than I am; and that remark is\none. I couldn’t think so OLD as that, try how I might....And no lover\nhas ever kissed you before?’\n\n‘Never.’\n\n‘I knew that; you were so unused. You ride well, but you don’t kiss\nnicely at all; and I was told once, by my friend Knight, that that is an\nexcellent fault in woman.’\n\n‘Now, come; I must mount again, or we shall not be home by dinner-time.’\nAnd they returned to where Pansy stood tethered. ‘Instead of entrusting\nmy weight to a young man’s unstable palm,’ she continued gaily, ‘I\nprefer a surer “upping-stock” (as the villagers call it), in the form of\na gate. There--now I am myself again.’\n\nThey proceeded homeward at the same walking pace.\n\nHer blitheness won Stephen out of his thoughtfulness, and each forgot\neverything but the tone of the moment.\n\n‘What did you love me for?’ she said, after a long musing look at a\nflying bird.\n\n‘I don’t know,’ he replied idly.\n\n‘Oh yes, you do,’ insisted Elfride.\n\n‘Perhaps, for your eyes.’\n\n‘What of them?--now, don’t vex me by a light answer. What of my eyes?’\n\n‘Oh, nothing to be mentioned. They are indifferently good.’\n\n‘Come, Stephen, I won’t have that. What did you love me for?’\n\n‘It might have been for your mouth?’\n\n‘Well, what about my mouth?’\n\n‘I thought it was a passable mouth enough----’\n\n‘That’s not very comforting.’\n\n‘With a pretty pout and sweet lips; but actually, nothing more than what\neverybody has.’\n\n‘Don’t make up things out of your head as you go on, there’s a dear\nStephen. Now--what--did--you--love--me--for?’\n\n‘Perhaps, ‘twas for your neck and hair; though I am not sure: or for\nyour idle blood, that did nothing but wander away from your cheeks\nand back again; but I am not sure. Or your hands and arms, that they\neclipsed all other hands and arms; or your feet, that they played about\nunder your dress like little mice; or your tongue, that it was of a dear\ndelicate tone. But I am not altogether sure.’\n\n‘Ah, that’s pretty to say; but I don’t care for your love, if it made a\nmere flat picture of me in that way, and not being sure, and such\ncold reasoning; but what you FELT I was, you know, Stephen’ (at this\na stealthy laugh and frisky look into his face), ‘when you said to\nyourself, “I’ll certainly love that young lady.”’\n\n‘I never said it.’\n\n‘When you said to yourself, then, “I never will love that young lady.”’\n\n‘I didn’t say that, either.’\n\n‘Then was it, “I suppose I must love that young lady?”’\n\n‘No.’\n\n‘What, then?’\n\n‘’Twas much more fluctuating--not so definite.’\n\n‘Tell me; do, do.’\n\n‘It was that I ought not to think about you if I loved you truly.’\n\n‘Ah, that I don’t understand. There’s no getting it out of you. And I’ll\nnot ask you ever any more--never more--to say out of the deep reality of\nyour heart what you loved me for.’\n\n‘Sweet tantalizer, what’s the use? It comes to this sole simple thing:\nThat at one time I had never seen you, and I didn’t love you; that then\nI saw you, and I did love you. Is that enough?’\n\n‘Yes; I will make it do....I know, I think, what I love you for. You are\nnice-looking, of course; but I didn’t mean for that. It is because you\nare so docile and gentle.’\n\n‘Those are not quite the correct qualities for a man to be loved for,’\nsaid Stephen, in rather a dissatisfied tone of self-criticism. ‘Well,\nnever mind. I must ask your father to allow us to be engaged directly we\nget indoors. It will be for a long time.’\n\n‘I like it the better....Stephen, don’t mention it till to-morrow.’\n\n‘Why?’\n\n‘Because, if he should object--I don’t think he will; but if\nhe should--we shall have a day longer of happiness from our\nignorance....Well, what are you thinking of so deeply?’\n\n‘I was thinking how my dear friend Knight would enjoy this scene. I wish\nhe could come here.’\n\n‘You seem very much engrossed with him,’ she answered, with a jealous\nlittle toss. ‘He must be an interesting man to take up so much of your\nattention.’\n\n‘Interesting!’ said Stephen, his face glowing with his fervour; ‘noble,\nyou ought to say.’\n\n‘Oh yes, yes; I forgot,’ she said half satirically. ‘The noblest man in\nEngland, as you told us last night.’\n\n‘He is a fine fellow, laugh as you will, Miss Elfie.’\n\n‘I know he is your hero. But what does he do? anything?’\n\n‘He writes.’\n\n‘What does he write? I have never heard of his name.’\n\n‘Because his personality, and that of several others like him, is\nabsorbed into a huge WE, namely, the impalpable entity called the\nPRESENT--a social and literary Review.’\n\n‘Is he only a reviewer?’\n\n‘ONLY, Elfie! Why, I can tell you it is a fine thing to be on the staff\nof the PRESENT. Finer than being a novelist considerably.’\n\n‘That’s a hit at me, and my poor COURT OF KELLYON CASTLE.’\n\n‘No, Elfride,’ he whispered; ‘I didn’t mean that. I mean that he is\nreally a literary man of some eminence, and not altogether a reviewer.\nHe writes things of a higher class than reviews, though he reviews\na book occasionally. His ordinary productions are social and ethical\nessays--all that the PRESENT contains which is not literary reviewing.’\n\n‘I admit he must be talented if he writes for the PRESENT. We have it\nsent to us irregularly. I want papa to be a subscriber, but he’s so\nconservative. Now the next point in this Mr. Knight--I suppose he is a\nvery good man.’\n\n‘An excellent man. I shall try to be his intimate friend some day.’\n\n‘But aren’t you now?’\n\n‘No; not so much as that,’ replied Stephen, as if such a supposition\nwere extravagant. ‘You see, it was in this way--he came originally from\nthe same place as I, and taught me things; but I am not intimate with\nhim. Shan’t I be glad when I get richer and better known, and hob and\nnob with him!’ Stephen’s eyes sparkled.\n\nA pout began to shape itself upon Elfride’s soft lips. ‘You think always\nof him, and like him better than you do me!’\n\n‘No, indeed, Elfride. The feeling is different quite. But I do like him,\nand he deserves even more affection from me than I give.’\n\n‘You are not nice now, and you make me as jealous as possible!’ she\nexclaimed perversely. ‘I know you will never speak to any third person\nof me so warmly as you do to me of him.’\n\n‘But you don’t understand, Elfride,’ he said with an anxious movement.\n‘You shall know him some day. He is so brilliant--no, it isn’t exactly\nbrilliant; so thoughtful--nor does thoughtful express him--that it would\ncharm you to talk to him. He’s a most desirable friend, and that isn’t\nhalf I could say.’\n\n‘I don’t care how good he is; I don’t want to know him, because he comes\nbetween me and you. You think of him night and day, ever so much more\nthan of anybody else; and when you are thinking of him, I am shut out of\nyour mind.’\n\n‘No, dear Elfride; I love you dearly.’\n\n‘And I don’t like you to tell me so warmly about him when you are in\nthe middle of loving me. Stephen, suppose that I and this man Knight of\nyours were both drowning, and you could only save one of us----’\n\n‘Yes--the stupid old proposition--which would I save?\n\n‘Well, which? Not me.’\n\n‘Both of you,’ he said, pressing her pendent hand.\n\n‘No, that won’t do; only one of us.’\n\n‘I cannot say; I don’t know. It is disagreeable--quite a horrid idea to\nhave to handle.’\n\n‘A-ha, I know. You would save him, and let me drown, drown, drown; and I\ndon’t care about your love!’\n\nShe had endeavoured to give a playful tone to her words, but the latter\nspeech was rather forced in its gaiety.\n\nAt this point in the discussion she trotted off to turn a corner which\nwas avoided by the footpath, the road and the path reuniting at a point\na little further on. On again making her appearance she continually\nmanaged to look in a direction away from him, and left him in the\ncool shade of her displeasure. Stephen was soon beaten at this game of\nindifference. He went round and entered the range of her vision.\n\n‘Are you offended, Elfie? Why don’t you talk?’\n\n‘Save me, then, and let that Mr. Clever of yours drown. I hate him. Now,\nwhich would you?’\n\n‘Really, Elfride, you should not press such a hard question. It is\nridiculous.’\n\n‘Then I won’t be alone with you any more. Unkind, to wound me so!’ She\nlaughed at her own absurdity but persisted.\n\n‘Come, Elfie, let’s make it up and be friends.’\n\n‘Say you would save me, then, and let him drown.’\n\n‘I would save you--and him too.’\n\n‘And let him drown. Come, or you don’t love me!’ she teasingly went on.\n\n‘And let him drown,’ he ejaculated despairingly.\n\n‘There; now I am yours!’ she said, and a woman’s flush of triumph lit\nher eyes.\n\n\n\n‘Only one earring, miss, as I’m alive,’ said Unity on their entering the\nhall.\n\nWith a face expressive of wretched misgiving, Elfride’s hand flew like\nan arrow to her ear.\n\n‘There!’ she exclaimed to Stephen, looking at him with eyes full of\nreproach.\n\n‘I quite forgot, indeed. If I had only remembered!’ he answered, with a\nconscience-stricken face.\n\nShe wheeled herself round, and turned into the shrubbery. Stephen\nfollowed.\n\n‘If you had told me to watch anything, Stephen, I should have\nreligiously done it,’ she capriciously went on, as soon as she heard him\nbehind her.\n\n‘Forgetting is forgivable.’\n\n‘Well, you will find it, if you want me to respect you and be engaged\nto you when we have asked papa.’ She considered a moment, and added more\nseriously, ‘I know now where I dropped it, Stephen. It was on the cliff.\nI remember a faint sensation of some change about me, but I was too\nabsent to think of it then. And that’s where it is now, and you must go\nand look there.’\n\n‘I’ll go at once.’\n\nAnd he strode away up the valley, under a broiling sun and amid the\ndeathlike silence of early afternoon. He ascended, with giddy-paced\nhaste, the windy range of rocks to where they had sat, felt and peered\nabout the stones and crannies, but Elfride’s stray jewel was nowhere\nto be seen. Next Stephen slowly retraced his steps, and, pausing at a\ncross-road to reflect a while, he left the plateau and struck downwards\nacross some fields, in the direction of Endelstow House.\n\nHe walked along the path by the river without the slightest hesitation\nas to its bearing, apparently quite familiar with every inch of the\nground. As the shadows began to lengthen and the sunlight to mellow,\nhe passed through two wicket-gates, and drew near the outskirts of\nEndelstow Park. The river now ran along under the park fence, previous\nto entering the grove itself, a little further on.\n\nHere stood a cottage, between the fence and the stream, on a slightly\nelevated spot of ground, round which the river took a turn. The\ncharacteristic feature of this snug habitation was its one chimney in\nthe gable end, its squareness of form disguised by a huge cloak of ivy,\nwhich had grown so luxuriantly and extended so far from its base, as to\nincrease the apparent bulk of the chimney to the dimensions of a tower.\nSome little distance from the back of the house rose the park boundary,\nand over this were to be seen the sycamores of the grove, making slow\ninclinations to the just-awakening air.\n\nStephen crossed the little wood bridge in front, went up to the cottage\ndoor, and opened it without knock or signal of any kind.\n\nExclamations of welcome burst from some person or persons when the door\nwas thrust ajar, followed by the scrape of chairs on a stone floor, as\nif pushed back by their occupiers in rising from a table. The door was\nclosed again, and nothing could now be heard from within, save a lively\nchatter and the rattle of plates.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VIII\n\n     ‘Allen-a-Dale is no baron or lord.’\n\n\nThe mists were creeping out of pools and swamps for their pilgrimages\nof the night when Stephen came up to the front door of the vicarage.\nElfride was standing on the step illuminated by a lemon-hued expanse of\nwestern sky.\n\n‘You never have been all this time looking for that earring?’ she said\nanxiously.\n\n‘Oh no; and I have not found it.’\n\n‘Never mind. Though I am much vexed; they are my prettiest. But,\nStephen, what ever have you been doing--where have you been? I have\nbeen so uneasy. I feared for you, knowing not an inch of the country. I\nthought, suppose he has fallen over the cliff! But now I am inclined to\nscold you for frightening me so.’\n\n‘I must speak to your father now,’ he said rather abruptly; ‘I have so\nmuch to say to him--and to you, Elfride.’\n\n‘Will what you have to say endanger this nice time of ours, and is it\nthat same shadowy secret you allude to so frequently, and will it make\nme unhappy?’\n\n‘Possibly.’\n\nShe breathed heavily, and looked around as if for a prompter.\n\n‘Put it off till to-morrow,’ she said.\n\nHe involuntarily sighed too.\n\n‘No; it must come to-night. Where is your father, Elfride?’\n\n‘Somewhere in the kitchen garden, I think,’ she replied. ‘That is his\nfavourite evening retreat. I will leave you now. Say all that’s to be\nsaid--do all there is to be done. Think of me waiting anxiously for the\nend.’ And she re-entered the house.\n\nShe waited in the drawing-room, watching the lights sink to shadows, the\nshadows sink to darkness, until her impatience to know what had occurred\nin the garden could no longer be controlled. She passed round the\nshrubbery, unlatched the garden door, and skimmed with her keen eyes the\nwhole twilighted space that the four walls enclosed and sheltered: they\nwere not there. She mounted a little ladder, which had been used for\ngathering fruit, and looked over the wall into the field. This field\nextended to the limits of the glebe, which was enclosed on that side by\na privet-hedge. Under the hedge was Mr. Swancourt, walking up and down,\nand talking aloud--to himself, as it sounded at first. No: another voice\nshouted occasional replies; and this interlocutor seemed to be on the\nother side of the hedge. The voice, though soft in quality, was not\nStephen’s.\n\nThe second speaker must have been in the long-neglected garden of an old\nmanor-house hard by, which, together with a small estate attached, had\nlately been purchased by a person named Troyton, whom Elfride had never\nseen. Her father might have struck up an acquaintanceship with some\nmember of that family through the privet-hedge, or a stranger to the\nneighbourhood might have wandered thither.\n\nWell, there was no necessity for disturbing him.\n\nAnd it seemed that, after all, Stephen had not yet made his desired\ncommunication to her father. Again she went indoors, wondering where\nStephen could be. For want of something better to do, she went upstairs\nto her own little room. Here she sat down at the open window, and,\nleaning with her elbow on the table and her cheek upon her hand, she\nfell into meditation.\n\nIt was a hot and still August night. Every disturbance of the silence\nwhich rose to the dignity of a noise could be heard for miles, and the\nmerest sound for a long distance. So she remained, thinking of Stephen,\nand wishing he had not deprived her of his company to no purpose, as it\nappeared. How delicate and sensitive he was, she reflected; and yet he\nwas man enough to have a private mystery, which considerably elevated\nhim in her eyes. Thus, looking at things with an inward vision, she lost\nconsciousness of the flight of time.\n\nStrange conjunctions of circumstances, particularly those of a trivial\neveryday kind, are so frequent in an ordinary life, that we grow used to\ntheir unaccountableness, and forget the question whether the very long\nodds against such juxtaposition is not almost a disproof of it being a\nmatter of chance at all. What occurred to Elfride at this moment was a\ncase in point. She was vividly imagining, for the twentieth time, the\nkiss of the morning, and putting her lips together in the position\nanother such a one would demand, when she heard the identical operation\nperformed on the lawn, immediately beneath her window.\n\nA kiss--not of the quiet and stealthy kind, but decisive, loud, and\nsmart.\n\nHer face flushed and she looked out, but to no purpose. The dark rim\nof the upland drew a keen sad line against the pale glow of the sky,\nunbroken except where a young cedar on the lawn, that had outgrown its\nfellow trees, shot its pointed head across the horizon, piercing the\nfirmamental lustre like a sting.\n\nIt was just possible that, had any persons been standing on the grassy\nportions of the lawn, Elfride might have seen their dusky forms. But the\nshrubs, which once had merely dotted the glade, had now grown bushy and\nlarge, till they hid at least half the enclosure containing them. The\nkissing pair might have been behind some of these; at any rate, nobody\nwas in sight.\n\nHad no enigma ever been connected with her lover by his hints and\nabsences, Elfride would never have thought of admitting into her mind a\nsuspicion that he might be concerned in the foregoing enactment. But the\nreservations he at present insisted on, while they added to the mystery\nwithout which perhaps she would never have seriously loved him at all,\nwere calculated to nourish doubts of all kinds, and with a slow flush of\njealousy she asked herself, might he not be the culprit?\n\nElfride glided downstairs on tiptoe, and out to the precise spot on\nwhich she had parted from Stephen to enable him to speak privately to\nher father. Thence she wandered into all the nooks around the place from\nwhich the sound seemed to proceed--among the huge laurestines, about the\ntufts of pampas grasses, amid the variegated hollies, under the weeping\nwych-elm--nobody was there. Returning indoors she called ‘Unity!’\n\n‘She is gone to her aunt’s, to spend the evening,’ said Mr. Swancourt,\nthrusting his head out of his study door, and letting the light of his\ncandles stream upon Elfride’s face--less revealing than, as it seemed to\nherself, creating the blush of uneasy perplexity that was burning upon\nher cheek.\n\n‘I didn’t know you were indoors, papa,’ she said with surprise. ‘Surely\nno light was shining from the window when I was on the lawn?’ and she\nlooked and saw that the shutters were still open.\n\n‘Oh yes, I am in,’ he said indifferently. ‘What did you want Unity for?\nI think she laid supper before she went out.’\n\n‘Did she?--I have not been to see--I didn’t want her for that.’\n\nElfride scarcely knew, now that a definite reason was required, what\nthat reason was. Her mind for a moment strayed to another subject,\nunimportant as it seemed. The red ember of a match was lying inside the\nfender, which explained that why she had seen no rays from the window\nwas because the candles had only just been lighted.\n\n‘I’ll come directly,’ said the vicar. ‘I thought you were out somewhere\nwith Mr. Smith.’\n\nEven the inexperienced Elfride could not help thinking that her father\nmust be wonderfully blind if he failed to perceive what was the nascent\nconsequence of herself and Stephen being so unceremoniously left\ntogether; wonderfully careless, if he saw it and did not think about\nit; wonderfully good, if, as seemed to her by far the most probable\nsupposition, he saw it and thought about it and approved of it. These\nreflections were cut short by the appearance of Stephen just outside the\nporch, silvered about the head and shoulders with touches of moonlight,\nthat had begun to creep through the trees.\n\n‘Has your trouble anything to do with a kiss on the lawn?’ she asked\nabruptly, almost passionately.\n\n‘Kiss on the lawn?’\n\n‘Yes!’ she said, imperiously now.\n\n‘I didn’t comprehend your meaning, nor do I now exactly. I certainly\nhave kissed nobody on the lawn, if that is really what you want to know,\nElfride.’\n\n‘You know nothing about such a performance?’\n\n‘Nothing whatever. What makes you ask?’\n\n‘Don’t press me to tell; it is nothing of importance. And, Stephen, you\nhave not yet spoken to papa about our engagement?’\n\n‘No,’ he said regretfully, ‘I could not find him directly; and then\nI went on thinking so much of what you said about objections,\nrefusals--bitter words possibly--ending our happiness, that I\nresolved to put it off till to-morrow; that gives us one more day of\ndelight--delight of a tremulous kind.’\n\n‘Yes; but it would be improper to be silent too long, I think,’ she said\nin a delicate voice, which implied that her face had grown warm. ‘I want\nhim to know we love, Stephen. Why did you adopt as your own my thought\nof delay?’\n\n‘I will explain; but I want to tell you of my secret first--to tell you\nnow. It is two or three hours yet to bedtime. Let us walk up the hill to\nthe church.’\n\nElfride passively assented, and they went from the lawn by a side\nwicket, and ascended into the open expanse of moonlight which streamed\naround the lonely edifice on the summit of the hill.\n\nThe door was locked. They turned from the porch, and walked hand in hand\nto find a resting-place in the churchyard. Stephen chose a flat tomb,\nshowing itself to be newer and whiter than those around it, and sitting\ndown himself, gently drew her hand towards him.\n\n‘No, not there,’ she said.\n\n‘Why not here?’\n\n‘A mere fancy; but never mind.’ And she sat down.\n\n‘Elfie, will you love me, in spite of everything that may be said\nagainst me?’\n\n‘O Stephen, what makes you repeat that so continually and so sadly? You\nknow I will. Yes, indeed,’ she said, drawing closer, ‘whatever may be\nsaid of you--and nothing bad can be--I will cling to you just the same.\nYour ways shall be my ways until I die.’\n\n‘Did you ever think what my parents might be, or what society I\noriginally moved in?’\n\n‘No, not particularly. I have observed one or two little points in your\nmanners which are rather quaint--no more. I suppose you have moved in\nthe ordinary society of professional people.’\n\n‘Supposing I have not--that none of my family have a profession except\nme?’\n\n‘I don’t mind. What you are only concerns me.’\n\n‘Where do you think I went to school--I mean, to what kind of school?’\n\n‘Dr. Somebody’s academy,’ she said simply.\n\n‘No. To a dame school originally, then to a national school.’\n\n‘Only to those! Well, I love you just as much, Stephen, dear Stephen,’\nshe murmured tenderly, ‘I do indeed. And why should you tell me these\nthings so impressively? What do they matter to me?’\n\nHe held her closer and proceeded:\n\n‘What do you think my father is--does for his living, that is to say?’\n\n‘He practises some profession or calling, I suppose.’\n\n‘No; he is a mason.’\n\n‘A Freemason?’\n\n‘No; a cottager and journeyman mason.’\n\nElfride said nothing at first. After a while she whispered:\n\n‘That is a strange idea to me. But never mind; what does it matter?’\n\n‘But aren’t you angry with me for not telling you before?’\n\n‘No, not at all. Is your mother alive?’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘Is she a nice lady?’\n\n‘Very--the best mother in the world. Her people had been well-to-do\nyeomen for centuries, but she was only a dairymaid.’\n\n‘O Stephen!’ came from her in whispered exclamation.\n\n‘She continued to attend to a dairy long after my father married her,’\npursued Stephen, without further hesitation. ‘And I remember very well\nhow, when I was very young, I used to go to the milking, look on at the\nskimming, sleep through the churning, and make believe I helped her. Ah,\nthat was a happy time enough!’\n\n‘No, never--not happy.’\n\n‘Yes, it was.’\n\n‘I don’t see how happiness could be where the drudgery of dairy-work\nhad to be done for a living--the hands red and chapped, and the shoes\nclogged....Stephen, I do own that it seems odd to regard you in the\nlight of--of--having been so rough in your youth, and done menial things\nof that kind.’ (Stephen withdrew an inch or two from her side.) ‘But\nI DO LOVE YOU just the same,’ she continued, getting closer under his\nshoulder again, ‘and I don’t care anything about the past; and I see\nthat you are all the worthier for having pushed on in the world in such\na way.’\n\n‘It is not my worthiness; it is Knight’s, who pushed me.’\n\n‘Ah, always he--always he!’\n\n‘Yes, and properly so. Now, Elfride, you see the reason of his teaching\nme by letter. I knew him years before he went to Oxford, but I had not\ngot far enough in my reading for him to entertain the idea of helping\nme in classics till he left home. Then I was sent away from the village,\nand we very seldom met; but he kept up this system of tuition by\ncorrespondence with the greatest regularity. I will tell you all the\nstory, but not now. There is nothing more to say now, beyond giving\nplaces, persons, and dates.’ His voice became timidly slow at this\npoint.\n\n‘No; don’t take trouble to say more. You are a dear honest fellow to say\nso much as you have; and it is not so dreadful either. It has become a\nnormal thing that millionaires commence by going up to London with their\ntools at their back, and half-a-crown in their pockets. That sort of\norigin is getting so respected,’ she continued cheerfully, ‘that it is\nacquiring some of the odour of Norman ancestry.’\n\n‘Ah, if I had MADE my fortune, I shouldn’t mind. But I am only a\npossible maker of it as yet.’\n\n‘It is quite enough. And so THIS is what your trouble was?’\n\n‘I thought I was doing wrong in letting you love me without telling you\nmy story; and yet I feared to do so, Elfie. I dreaded to lose you, and I\nwas cowardly on that account.’\n\n‘How plain everything about you seems after this explanation! Your\npeculiarities in chess-playing, the pronunciation papa noticed in your\nLatin, your odd mixture of book-knowledge with ignorance of ordinary\nsocial accomplishments, are accounted for in a moment. And has this\nanything to do with what I saw at Lord Luxellian’s?’\n\n‘What did you see?’\n\n‘I saw the shadow of yourself putting a cloak round a lady. I was at the\nside door; you two were in a room with the window towards me. You came\nto me a moment later.’\n\n‘She was my mother.’\n\n‘Your mother THERE!’ She withdrew herself to look at him silently in her\ninterest.\n\n‘Elfride,’ said Stephen, ‘I was going to tell you the remainder\nto-morrow--I have been keeping it back--I must tell it now, after all.\nThe remainder of my revelation refers to where my parents are. Where do\nyou think they live? You know them--by sight at any rate.’\n\n‘I know them!’ she said in suspended amazement.\n\n‘Yes. My father is John Smith, Lord Luxellian’s master-mason, who lives\nunder the park wall by the river.’\n\n‘O Stephen! can it be?’\n\n‘He built--or assisted at the building of the house you live in, years\nago. He put up those stone gate piers at the lodge entrance to Lord\nLuxellian’s park. My grandfather planted the trees that belt in your\nlawn; my grandmother--who worked in the fields with him--held each tree\nupright whilst he filled in the earth: they told me so when I was a\nchild. He was the sexton, too, and dug many of the graves around us.’\n\n‘And was your unaccountable vanishing on the first morning of your\narrival, and again this afternoon, a run to see your father and\nmother?...I understand now; no wonder you seemed to know your way about\nthe village!’\n\n‘No wonder. But remember, I have not lived here since I was nine years\nold. I then went to live with my uncle, a blacksmith, near Exonbury, in\norder to be able to attend a national school as a day scholar; there\nwas none on this remote coast then. It was there I met with my friend\nKnight. And when I was fifteen and had been fairly educated by the\nschool-master--and more particularly by Knight--I was put as a pupil in\nan architect’s office in that town, because I was skilful in the use\nof the pencil. A full premium was paid by the efforts of my mother\nand father, rather against the wishes of Lord Luxellian, who likes my\nfather, however, and thinks a great deal of him. There I stayed till six\nmonths ago, when I obtained a situation as improver, as it is called, in\na London office. That’s all of me.’\n\n‘To think YOU, the London visitor, the town man, should have been\nborn here, and have known this village so many years before I did. How\nstrange--how very strange it seems to me!’ she murmured.\n\n‘My mother curtseyed to you and your father last Sunday,’ said Stephen,\nwith a pained smile at the thought of the incongruity. ‘And your papa\nsaid to her, “I am glad to see you so regular at church, JANE.”’\n\n‘I remember it, but I have never spoken to her. We have only been here\neighteen months, and the parish is so large.’\n\n‘Contrast with this,’ said Stephen, with a miserable laugh, ‘your\nfather’s belief in my “blue blood,” which is still prevalent in his\nmind. The first night I came, he insisted upon proving my descent from\none of the most ancient west-county families, on account of my\nsecond Christian name; when the truth is, it was given me because my\ngrandfather was assistant gardener in the Fitzmaurice-Smith family for\nthirty years. Having seen your face, my darling, I had not heart to\ncontradict him, and tell him what would have cut me off from a friendly\nknowledge of you.’\n\nShe sighed deeply. ‘Yes, I see now how this inequality may be made\nto trouble us,’ she murmured, and continued in a low, sad whisper,\n‘I wouldn’t have minded if they had lived far away. Papa might have\nconsented to an engagement between us if your connection had been with\nvillagers a hundred miles off; remoteness softens family contrasts. But\nhe will not like--O Stephen, Stephen! what can I do?’\n\n‘Do?’ he said tentatively, yet with heaviness. ‘Give me up; let me go\nback to London, and think no more of me.’\n\n‘No, no; I cannot give you up! This hopelessness in our affairs makes me\ncare more for you....I see what did not strike me at first. Stephen,\nwhy do we trouble? Why should papa object? An architect in London is an\narchitect in London. Who inquires there? Nobody. We shall live there,\nshall we not? Why need we be so alarmed?’\n\n‘And Elfie,’ said Stephen, his hopes kindling with hers, ‘Knight thinks\nnothing of my being only a cottager’s son; he says I am as worthy of his\nfriendship as if I were a lord’s; and if I am worthy of his friendship,\nI am worthy of you, am I not, Elfride?’\n\n‘I not only have never loved anybody but you,’ she said, instead of\ngiving an answer, ‘but I have not even formed a strong friendship, such\nas you have for Knight. I wish you hadn’t. It diminishes me.’\n\n‘Now, Elfride, you know better,’ he said wooingly. ‘And had you really\nnever any sweetheart at all?’\n\n‘None that was ever recognized by me as such.’\n\n‘But did nobody ever love you?’\n\n‘Yes--a man did once; very much, he said.’\n\n‘How long ago?’\n\n‘Oh, a long time.’\n\n‘How long, dearest?\n\n‘A twelvemonth.’\n\n‘That’s not VERY long’ (rather disappointedly).\n\n‘I said long, not very long.’\n\n‘And did he want to marry you?’\n\n‘I believe he did. But I didn’t see anything in him. He was not good\nenough, even if I had loved him.’\n\n‘May I ask what he was?’\n\n‘A farmer.’\n\n‘A farmer not good enough--how much better than my family!’ Stephen\nmurmured.\n\n‘Where is he now?’ he continued to Elfride.\n\n‘HERE.’\n\n‘Here! what do you mean by that?’\n\n‘I mean that he is here.’\n\n‘Where here?’\n\n‘Under us. He is under this tomb. He is dead, and we are sitting on his\ngrave.’\n\n‘Elfie,’ said the young man, standing up and looking at the tomb,\n‘how odd and sad that revelation seems! It quite depresses me for the\nmoment.’\n\n‘Stephen! I didn’t wish to sit here; but you would do so.’\n\n‘You never encouraged him?’\n\n‘Never by look, word, or sign,’ she said solemnly. ‘He died of\nconsumption, and was buried the day you first came.’\n\n‘Let us go away. I don’t like standing by HIM, even if you never loved\nhim. He was BEFORE me.’\n\n‘Worries make you unreasonable,’ she half pouted, following Stephen at\nthe distance of a few steps. ‘Perhaps I ought to have told you before we\nsat down. Yes; let us go.’\n\n\n\n\nChapter IX\n\n    ‘Her father did fume’\n\n\nOppressed, in spite of themselves, by a foresight of impending\ncomplications, Elfride and Stephen returned down the hill hand in hand.\nAt the door they paused wistfully, like children late at school.\n\nWomen accept their destiny more readily than men. Elfride had now\nresigned herself to the overwhelming idea of her lover’s sorry\nantecedents; Stephen had not forgotten the trifling grievance that\nElfride had known earlier admiration than his own.\n\n‘What was that young man’s name?’ he inquired.\n\n‘Felix Jethway; a widow’s only son.’\n\n‘I remember the family.’\n\n‘She hates me now. She says I killed him.’\n\nStephen mused, and they entered the porch.\n\n‘Stephen, I love only you,’ she tremulously whispered. He pressed her\nfingers, and the trifling shadow passed away, to admit again the mutual\nand more tangible trouble.\n\nThe study appeared to be the only room lighted up. They entered,\neach with a demeanour intended to conceal the inconcealable fact that\nreciprocal love was their dominant chord. Elfride perceived a man,\nsitting with his back towards herself, talking to her father. She would\nhave retired, but Mr. Swancourt had seen her.\n\n‘Come in,’ he said; ‘it is only Martin Cannister, come for a copy of the\nregister for poor Mrs. Jethway.’\n\nMartin Cannister, the sexton, was rather a favourite with Elfride. He\nused to absorb her attention by telling her of his strange experiences\nin digging up after long years the bodies of persons he had known, and\nrecognizing them by some little sign (though in reality he had never\nrecognized any). He had shrewd small eyes and a great wealth of double\nchin, which compensated in some measure for considerable poverty of\nnose.\n\nThe appearance of a slip of paper in Cannister’s hand, and a few\nshillings lying on the table in front of him, denoted that the business\nhad been transacted, and the tenor of their conversation went to\nshow that a summary of village news was now engaging the attention of\nparishioner and parson.\n\nMr. Cannister stood up and touched his forehead over his eye with his\nfinger, in respectful salutation of Elfride, gave half as much salute to\nStephen (whom he, in common with other villagers, had never for a moment\nrecognized), then sat down again and resumed his discourse.\n\n‘Where had I got on to, sir?’\n\n‘To driving the pile,’ said Mr. Swancourt.\n\n‘The pile ‘twas. So, as I was saying, Nat was driving the pile in this\nmanner, as I might say.’ Here Mr. Cannister held his walking-stick\nscrupulously vertical with his left hand, and struck a blow with great\nforce on the knob of the stick with his right. ‘John was steadying the\npile so, as I might say.’ Here he gave the stick a slight shake, and\nlooked firmly in the various eyes around to see that before proceeding\nfurther his listeners well grasped the subject at that stage. ‘Well,\nwhen Nat had struck some half-dozen blows more upon the pile, ‘a stopped\nfor a second or two. John, thinking he had done striking, put his hand\nupon the top o’ the pile to gie en a pull, and see if ‘a were firm in\nthe ground.’ Mr. Cannister spread his hand over the top of the stick,\ncompletely covering it with his palm. ‘Well, so to speak, Nat hadn’t\nmaned to stop striking, and when John had put his hand upon the pile,\nthe beetle----’\n\n‘Oh dreadful!’ said Elfride.\n\n‘The beetle was already coming down, you see, sir. Nat just caught sight\nof his hand, but couldn’t stop the blow in time. Down came the beetle\nupon poor John Smith’s hand, and squashed en to a pummy.’\n\n‘Dear me, dear me! poor fellow!’ said the vicar, with an intonation like\nthe groans of the wounded in a pianoforte performance of the ‘Battle of\nPrague.’\n\n‘John Smith, the master-mason?’ cried Stephen hurriedly.\n\n‘Ay, no other; and a better-hearted man God A’mighty never made.’\n\n‘Is he so much hurt?’\n\n‘I have heard,’ said Mr. Swancourt, not noticing Stephen, ‘that he has a\nson in London, a very promising young fellow.’\n\n‘Oh, how he must be hurt!’ repeated Stephen.\n\n‘A beetle couldn’t hurt very little. Well, sir, good-night t’ye; and ye,\nsir; and you, miss, I’m sure.’\n\nMr. Cannister had been making unnoticeable motions of withdrawal, and by\nthe time this farewell remark came from his lips he was just outside the\ndoor of the room. He tramped along the hall, stayed more than a minute\nendeavouring to close the door properly, and then was lost to their\nhearing.\n\nStephen had meanwhile turned and said to the vicar:\n\n‘Please excuse me this evening! I must leave. John Smith is my father.’\n\nThe vicar did not comprehend at first.\n\n‘What did you say?’ he inquired.\n\n‘John Smith is my father,’ said Stephen deliberately.\n\nA surplus tinge of redness rose from Mr. Swancourt’s neck, and came\nround over his face, the lines of his features became more firmly\ndefined, and his lips seemed to get thinner. It was evident that a\nseries of little circumstances, hitherto unheeded, were now fitting\nthemselves together, and forming a lucid picture in Mr. Swancourt’s mind\nin such a manner as to render useless further explanation on Stephen’s\npart.\n\n‘Indeed,’ the vicar said, in a voice dry and without inflection.\n\nThis being a word which depends entirely upon its tone for its meaning,\nMr. Swancourt’s enunciation was equivalent to no expression at all.\n\n‘I have to go now,’ said Stephen, with an agitated bearing, and a\nmovement as if he scarcely knew whether he ought to run off or stay\nlonger. ‘On my return, sir, will you kindly grant me a few minutes’\nprivate conversation?’\n\n‘Certainly. Though antecedently it does not seem possible that there can\nbe anything of the nature of private business between us.’\n\nMr. Swancourt put on his straw hat, crossed the drawing-room, into which\nthe moonlight was shining, and stepped out of the French window into\nthe verandah. It required no further effort to perceive what, indeed,\nreasoning might have foretold as the natural colour of a mind whose\npleasures were taken amid genealogies, good dinners, and patrician\nreminiscences, that Mr. Swancourt’s prejudices were too strong for his\ngenerosity, and that Stephen’s moments as his friend and equal were\nnumbered, or had even now ceased.\n\nStephen moved forward as if he would follow the vicar, then as if he\nwould not, and in absolute perplexity whither to turn himself, went\nawkwardly to the door. Elfride followed lingeringly behind him. Before\nhe had receded two yards from the doorstep, Unity and Ann the housemaid\ncame home from their visit to the village.\n\n‘Have you heard anything about John Smith? The accident is not so bad as\nwas reported, is it?’ said Elfride intuitively.\n\n‘Oh no; the doctor says it is only a bad bruise.’\n\n‘I thought so!’ cried Elfride gladly.\n\n‘He says that, although Nat believes he did not check the beetle as\nit came down, he must have done so without knowing it--checked it very\nconsiderably too; for the full blow would have knocked his hand abroad,\nand in reality it is only made black-and-blue like.’\n\n‘How thankful I am!’ said Stephen.\n\nThe perplexed Unity looked at him with her mouth rather than with her\neyes.\n\n‘That will do, Unity,’ said Elfride magisterially; and the two maids\npassed on.\n\n‘Elfride, do you forgive me?’ said Stephen with a faint smile. ‘No man\nis fair in love;’ and he took her fingers lightly in his own.\n\nWith her head thrown sideways in the Greuze attitude, she looked a\ntender reproach at his doubt and pressed his hand. Stephen returned the\npressure threefold, then hastily went off to his father’s cottage by the\nwall of Endelstow Park.\n\n‘Elfride, what have you to say to this?’ inquired her father, coming up\nimmediately Stephen had retired.\n\nWith feminine quickness she grasped at any straw that would enable her\nto plead his cause. ‘He had told me of it,’ she faltered; ‘so that it is\nnot a discovery in spite of him. He was just coming in to tell you.’\n\n‘COMING to tell! Why hadn’t he already told? I object as much, if\nnot more, to his underhand concealment of this, than I do to the fact\nitself. It looks very much like his making a fool of me, and of you too.\nYou and he have been about together, and corresponding together, in a\nway I don’t at all approve of--in a most unseemly way. You should have\nknown how improper such conduct is. A woman can’t be too careful not to\nbe seen alone with I-don’t-know-whom.’\n\n‘You saw us, papa, and have never said a word.’\n\n‘My fault, of course; my fault. What the deuce could I be thinking of!\nHe, a villager’s son; and we, Swancourts, connections of the Luxellians.\nWe have been coming to nothing for centuries, and now I believe we have\ngot there. What shall I next invite here, I wonder!’\n\nElfride began to cry at this very unpropitious aspect of affairs.\n‘O papa, papa, forgive me and him! We care so much for one another,\npapa--O, so much! And what he was going to ask you is, if you will allow\nof an engagement between us till he is a gentleman as good as you. We\nare not in a hurry, dear papa; we don’t want in the least to marry now;\nnot until he is richer. Only will you let us be engaged, because I love\nhim so, and he loves me?’\n\nMr. Swancourt’s feelings were a little touched by this appeal, and he\nwas annoyed that such should be the case. ‘Certainly not!’ he replied.\nHe pronounced the inhibition lengthily and sonorously, so that the ‘not’\nsounded like ‘n-o-o-o-t!’\n\n‘No, no, no; don’t say it!’\n\n‘Foh! A fine story. It is not enough that I have been deluded\nand disgraced by having him here,--the son of one of my village\npeasants,--but now I am to make him my son-in-law! Heavens above us, are\nyou mad, Elfride?’\n\n‘You have seen his letters come to me ever since his first visit, papa,\nand you knew they were a sort of--love-letters; and since he has been\nhere you have let him be alone with me almost entirely; and you guessed,\nyou must have guessed, what we were thinking of, and doing, and you\ndidn’t stop him. Next to love-making comes love-winning, and you knew it\nwould come to that, papa.’\n\nThe vicar parried this common-sense thrust. ‘I know--since you press me\nso--I know I did guess some childish attachment might arise between\nyou; I own I did not take much trouble to prevent it; but I have not\nparticularly countenanced it; and, Elfride, how can you expect that I\nshould now? It is impossible; no father in England would hear of such a\nthing.’\n\n‘But he is the same man, papa; the same in every particular; and how can\nhe be less fit for me than he was before?’\n\n‘He appeared a young man with well-to-do friends, and a little property;\nbut having neither, he is another man.’\n\n‘You inquired nothing about him?’\n\n‘I went by Hewby’s introduction. He should have told me. So should\nthe young man himself; of course he should. I consider it a most\ndishonourable thing to come into a man’s house like a treacherous\nI-don’t-know-what.’\n\n‘But he was afraid to tell you, and so should I have been. He loved me\ntoo well to like to run the risk. And as to speaking of his friends on\nhis first visit, I don’t see why he should have done so at all. He came\nhere on business: it was no affair of ours who his parents were. And\nthen he knew that if he told you he would never be asked here, and would\nperhaps never see me again. And he wanted to see me. Who can blame him\nfor trying, by any means, to stay near me--the girl he loves? All is\nfair in love. I have heard you say so yourself, papa; and you yourself\nwould have done just as he has--so would any man.’\n\n‘And any man, on discovering what I have discovered, would also do as I\ndo, and mend my mistake; that is, get shot of him again, as soon as the\nlaws of hospitality will allow.’ But Mr. Swancourt then remembered that\nhe was a Christian. ‘I would not, for the world, seem to turn him out\nof doors,’ he added; ‘but I think he will have the tact to see that he\ncannot stay long after this, with good taste.’\n\n‘He will, because he’s a gentleman. See how graceful his manners are,’\nElfride went on; though perhaps Stephen’s manners, like the feats\nof Euryalus, owed their attractiveness in her eyes rather to the\nattractiveness of his person than to their own excellence.\n\n‘Ay; anybody can be what you call graceful, if he lives a little time\nin a city, and keeps his eyes open. And he might have picked up his\ngentlemanliness by going to the galleries of theatres, and watching\nstage drawing-room manners. He reminds me of one of the worst stories I\never heard in my life.’\n\n‘What story was that?’\n\n‘Oh no, thank you! I wouldn’t tell you such an improper matter for the\nworld!’\n\n‘If his father and mother had lived in the north or east of England,’\ngallantly persisted Elfride, though her sobs began to interrupt her\narticulation, ‘anywhere but here--you--would have--only regarded--HIM,\nand not THEM! His station--would have--been what--his profession makes\nit,--and not fixed by--his father’s humble position--at all; whom he\nnever lives with--now. Though John Smith has saved lots of money, and\nis better off than we are, they say, or he couldn’t have put his son\nto such an expensive profession. And it is clever and--honourable--of\nStephen, to be the best of his family.’\n\n‘Yes. “Let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the\nking’s mess.”’\n\n‘You insult me, papa!’ she burst out. ‘You do, you do! He is my own\nStephen, he is!’\n\n‘That may or may not be true, Elfride,’ returned her father, again\nuncomfortably agitated in spite of himself ‘You confuse future\nprobabilities with present facts,--what the young man may be with what\nhe is. We must look at what he is, not what an improbable degree of\nsuccess in his profession may make him. The case is this: the son of\na working-man in my parish who may or may not be able to buy me up--a\nyouth who has not yet advanced so far into life as to have any income\nof his own deserving the name, and therefore of his father’s degree as\nregards station--wants to be engaged to you. His family are living\nin precisely the same spot in England as yours, so throughout this\ncounty--which is the world to us--you would always be known as the wife\nof Jack Smith the mason’s son, and not under any circumstances as\nthe wife of a London professional man. It is the drawback, not the\ncompensating fact, that is talked of always. There, say no more. You may\nargue all night, and prove what you will; I’ll stick to my words.’\n\nElfride looked silently and hopelessly out of the window with large\nheavy eyes and wet cheeks.\n\n‘I call it great temerity--and long to call it audacity--in Hewby,’\nresumed her father. ‘I never heard such a thing--giving such a\nhobbledehoy native of this place such an introduction to me as he did.\nNaturally you were deceived as well as I was. I don’t blame you at all,\nso far.’ He went and searched for Mr. Hewby’s original letter. ‘Here’s\nwhat he said to me: “Dear Sir,--Agreeably to your request of the 18th\ninstant, I have arranged to survey and make drawings,” et cetera. “My\nassistant, Mr. Stephen Smith,”--assistant, you see he called him, and\nnaturally I understood him to mean a sort of partner. Why didn’t he say\n“clerk”?’\n\n‘They never call them clerks in that profession, because they do not\nwrite. Stephen--Mr. Smith--told me so. So that Mr. Hewby simply used the\naccepted word.’\n\n‘Let me speak, please, Elfride! My assistant, Mr. Stephen Smith, will\nleave London by the early train to-morrow morning...MANY THANKS FOR YOUR\nPROPOSAL TO ACCOMMODATE HIM...YOU MAY PUT EVERY CONFIDENCE IN HIM, and\nmay rely upon his discernment in the matter of church architecture.”\n Well, I repeat that Hewby ought to be ashamed of himself for making so\nmuch of a poor lad of that sort.’\n\n‘Professional men in London,’ Elfride argued, ‘don’t know anything about\ntheir clerks’ fathers and mothers. They have assistants who come to\ntheir offices and shops for years, and hardly even know where they\nlive. What they can do--what profits they can bring the firm--that’s all\nLondon men care about. And that is helped in him by his faculty of being\nuniformly pleasant.’\n\n‘Uniform pleasantness is rather a defect than a faculty. It shows that a\nman hasn’t sense enough to know whom to despise.’\n\n‘It shows that he acts by faith and not by sight, as those you claim\nsuccession from directed.’\n\n‘That’s some more of what he’s been telling you, I suppose! Yes, I was\ninclined to suspect him, because he didn’t care about sauces of any\nkind. I always did doubt a man’s being a gentleman if his palate had no\nacquired tastes. An unedified palate is the irrepressible cloven foot\nof the upstart. The idea of my bringing out a bottle of my ‘40\nMartinez--only eleven of them left now--to a man who didn’t know it from\neighteenpenny! Then the Latin line he gave to my quotation; it was very\ncut-and-dried, very; or I, who haven’t looked into a classical author\nfor the last eighteen years, shouldn’t have remembered it. Well,\nElfride, you had better go to your room; you’ll get over this bit of\ntomfoolery in time.’\n\n‘No, no, no, papa,’ she moaned. For of all the miseries attaching to\nmiserable love, the worst is the misery of thinking that the passion\nwhich is the cause of them all may cease.\n\n‘Elfride,’ said her father with rough friendliness, ‘I have an excellent\nscheme on hand, which I cannot tell you of now. A scheme to benefit you\nand me. It has been thrust upon me for some little time--yes, thrust\nupon me--but I didn’t dream of its value till this afternoon, when the\nrevelation came. I should be most unwise to refuse to entertain it.’\n\n‘I don’t like that word,’ she returned wearily. ‘You have lost so much\nalready by schemes. Is it those wretched mines again?’\n\n‘No; not a mining scheme.’\n\n‘Railways?’\n\n‘Nor railways. It is like those mysterious offers we see advertised,\nby which any gentleman with no brains at all may make so much a week\nwithout risk, trouble, or soiling his fingers. However, I am intending\nto say nothing till it is settled, though I will just say this much,\nthat you soon may have other fish to fry than to think of Stephen Smith.\nRemember, I wish, not to be angry, but friendly, to the young man; for\nyour sake I’ll regard him as a friend in a certain sense. But this is\nenough; in a few days you will be quite my way of thinking. There, now,\ngo to your bedroom. Unity shall bring you up some supper. I wish you not\nto be here when he comes back.’\n\n\n\n\nChapter X\n\n     ‘Beneath the shelter of an aged tree.’\n\n\nStephen retraced his steps towards the cottage he had visited only\ntwo or three hours previously. He drew near and under the rich foliage\ngrowing about the outskirts of Endelstow Park, the spotty lights and\nshades from the shining moon maintaining a race over his head and down\nhis back in an endless gambol. When he crossed the plank bridge and\nentered the garden-gate, he saw an illuminated figure coming from the\nenclosed plot towards the house on the other side. It was his father,\nwith his hand in a sling, taking a general moonlight view of the garden,\nand particularly of a plot of the youngest of young turnips, previous to\nclosing the cottage for the night.\n\nHe saluted his son with customary force. ‘Hallo, Stephen! We should ha’\nbeen in bed in another ten minutes. Come to see what’s the matter wi’\nme, I suppose, my lad?’\n\nThe doctor had come and gone, and the hand had been pronounced as\ninjured but slightly, though it might possibly have been considered\na far more serious case if Mr. Smith had been a more important man.\nStephen’s anxious inquiry drew from his father words of regret at the\ninconvenience to the world of his doing nothing for the next two days,\nrather than of concern for the pain of the accident. Together they\nentered the house.\n\nJohn Smith--brown as autumn as to skin, white as winter as to\nclothes--was a satisfactory specimen of the village artificer in stone.\nIn common with most rural mechanics, he had too much individuality to be\na typical ‘working-man’--a resultant of that beach-pebble attrition with\nhis kind only to be experienced in large towns, which metamorphoses the\nunit Self into a fraction of the unit Class.\n\nThere was not the speciality in his labour which distinguishes the\nhandicraftsmen of towns. Though only a mason, strictly speaking, he was\nnot above handling a brick, if bricks were the order of the day; or a\nslate or tile, if a roof had to be covered before the wet weather set\nin, and nobody was near who could do it better. Indeed, on one or two\noccasions in the depth of winter, when frost peremptorily forbids all\nuse of the trowel, making foundations to settle, stones to fly, and\nmortar to crumble, he had taken to felling and sawing trees. Moreover,\nhe had practised gardening in his own plot for so many years that, on an\nemergency, he might have made a living by that calling.\n\nProbably our countryman was not such an accomplished artificer in a\nparticular direction as his town brethren in the trades. But he was, in\ntruth, like that clumsy pin-maker who made the whole pin, and who was\ndespised by Adam Smith on that account and respected by Macaulay, much\nmore the artist nevertheless.\n\nAppearing now, indoors, by the light of the candle, his stalwart\nhealthiness was a sight to see. His beard was close and knotted as that\nof a chiselled Hercules; his shirt sleeves were partly rolled up, his\nwaistcoat unbuttoned; the difference in hue between the snowy linen and\nthe ruddy arms and face contrasting like the white of an egg and its\nyolk. Mrs. Smith, on hearing them enter, advanced from the pantry.\n\nMrs. Smith was a matron whose countenance addressed itself to the\nmind rather than to the eye, though not exclusively. She retained her\npersonal freshness even now, in the prosy afternoon-time of her life;\nbut what her features were primarily indicative of was a sound common\nsense behind them; as a whole, appearing to carry with them a sort of\nargumentative commentary on the world in general.\n\nThe details of the accident were then rehearsed by Stephen’s father, in\nthe dramatic manner also common to Martin Cannister, other individuals\nof the neighbourhood, and the rural world generally. Mrs. Smith threw in\nher sentiments between the acts, as Coryphaeus of the tragedy, to make\nthe description complete. The story at last came to an end, as the\nlongest will, and Stephen directed the conversation into another\nchannel.\n\n‘Well, mother, they know everything about me now,’ he said quietly.\n\n‘Well done!’ replied his father; ‘now my mind’s at peace.’\n\n‘I blame myself--I never shall forgive myself--for not telling them\nbefore,’ continued the young man.\n\nMrs. Smith at this point abstracted her mind from the former subject. ‘I\ndon’t see what you have to grieve about, Stephen,’ she said. ‘People who\naccidentally get friends don’t, as a first stroke, tell the history of\ntheir families.’\n\n‘Ye’ve done no wrong, certainly,’ said his father.\n\n‘No; but I should have spoken sooner. There’s more in this visit of mine\nthan you think--a good deal more.’\n\n‘Not more than I think,’ Mrs. Smith replied, looking contemplatively at\nhim. Stephen blushed; and his father looked from one to the other in a\nstate of utter incomprehension.\n\n‘She’s a pretty piece enough,’ Mrs. Smith continued, ‘and very lady-like\nand clever too. But though she’s very well fit for you as far as that\nis, why, mercy ‘pon me, what ever do you want any woman at all for yet?’\n\nJohn made his naturally short mouth a long one, and wrinkled his\nforehead, ‘That’s the way the wind d’blow, is it?’ he said.\n\n‘Mother,’ exclaimed Stephen, ‘how absurdly you speak! Criticizing\nwhether she’s fit for me or no, as if there were room for doubt on\nthe matter! Why, to marry her would be the great blessing of my\nlife--socially and practically, as well as in other respects. No such\ngood fortune as that, I’m afraid; she’s too far above me. Her family\ndoesn’t want such country lads as I in it.’\n\n‘Then if they don’t want you, I’d see them dead corpses before I’d want\nthem, and go to better families who do want you.’\n\n‘Ah, yes; but I could never put up with the distaste of being welcomed\namong such people as you mean, whilst I could get indifference among\nsuch people as hers.’\n\n‘What crazy twist o’ thinking will enter your head next?’ said his\nmother. ‘And come to that, she’s not a bit too high for you, or you too\nlow for her. See how careful I be to keep myself up. I’m sure I never\nstop for more than a minute together to talk to any journeymen people;\nand I never invite anybody to our party o’ Christmases who are not\nin business for themselves. And I talk to several toppermost carriage\npeople that come to my lord’s without saying ma’am or sir to ‘em, and\nthey take it as quiet as lambs.’\n\n‘You curtseyed to the vicar, mother; and I wish you hadn’t.’\n\n‘But it was before he called me by my Christian name, or he would have\ngot very little curtseying from me!’ said Mrs. Smith, bridling and\nsparkling with vexation. ‘You go on at me, Stephen, as if I were your\nworst enemy! What else could I do with the man to get rid of him,\nbanging it into me and your father by side and by seam, about his\ngreatness, and what happened when he was a young fellow at college, and\nI don’t know what-all; the tongue o’ en flopping round his mouth like a\nmop-rag round a dairy. That ‘a did, didn’t he, John?’\n\n‘That’s about the size o’t,’ replied her husband.\n\n‘Every woman now-a-days,’ resumed Mrs. Smith, ‘if she marry at all, must\nexpect a father-in-law of a rank lower than her father. The men have\ngone up so, and the women have stood still. Every man you meet is more\nthe dand than his father; and you are just level wi’ her.’\n\n‘That’s what she thinks herself.’\n\n‘It only shows her sense. I knew she was after ‘ee, Stephen--I knew it.’\n\n‘After me! Good Lord, what next!’\n\n‘And I really must say again that you ought not to be in such a hurry,\nand wait for a few years. You might go higher than a bankrupt pa’son’s\ngirl then.’\n\n‘The fact is, mother,’ said Stephen impatiently, ‘you don’t know\nanything about it. I shall never go higher, because I don’t want to, nor\nshould I if I lived to be a hundred. As to you saying that she’s after\nme, I don’t like such a remark about her, for it implies a scheming\nwoman, and a man worth scheming for, both of which are not only untrue,\nbut ludicrously untrue, of this case. Isn’t it so, father?’\n\n‘I’m afraid I don’t understand the matter well enough to gie my\nopinion,’ said his father, in the tone of the fox who had a cold and\ncould not smell.\n\n‘She couldn’t have been very backward anyhow, considering the short\ntime you have known her,’ said his mother. ‘Well I think that five years\nhence you’ll be plenty young enough to think of such things. And really\nshe can very well afford to wait, and will too, take my word. Living\ndown in an out-step place like this, I am sure she ought to be very\nthankful that you took notice of her. She’d most likely have died an old\nmaid if you hadn’t turned up.’\n\n‘All nonsense,’ said Stephen, but not aloud.\n\n‘A nice little thing she is,’ Mrs. Smith went on in a more complacent\ntone now that Stephen had been talked down; ‘there’s not a word to say\nagainst her, I’ll own. I see her sometimes decked out like a horse going\nto fair, and I admire her for’t. A perfect little lady. But people can’t\nhelp their thoughts, and if she’d learnt to make figures instead of\nletters when she was at school ‘twould have been better for her pocket;\nfor as I said, there never were worse times for such as she than now.’\n\n‘Now, now, mother!’ said Stephen with smiling deprecation.\n\n‘But I will!’ said his mother with asperity. ‘I don’t read the papers\nfor nothing, and I know men all move up a stage by marriage. Men of her\nclass, that is, parsons, marry squires’ daughters; squires marry lords’\ndaughters; lords marry dukes’ daughters; dukes marry queens’ daughters.\nAll stages of gentlemen mate a stage higher; and the lowest stage of\ngentlewomen are left single, or marry out of their class.’\n\n‘But you said just now, dear mother----’ retorted Stephen, unable to\nresist the temptation of showing his mother her inconsistency. Then he\npaused.\n\n‘Well, what did I say?’ And Mrs. Smith prepared her lips for a new\ncampaign.\n\nStephen, regretting that he had begun, since a volcano might be the\nconsequence, was obliged to go on.\n\n‘You said I wasn’t out of her class just before.’\n\n‘Yes, there, there! That’s you; that’s my own flesh and blood. I’ll\nwarrant that you’ll pick holes in everything your mother says, if you\ncan, Stephen. You are just like your father for that; take anybody’s\npart but mine. Whilst I am speaking and talking and trying and slaving\naway for your good, you are waiting to catch me out in that way. So you\nare in her class, but ‘tis what HER people would CALL marrying out of\nher class. Don’t be so quarrelsome, Stephen!’\n\nStephen preserved a discreet silence, in which he was imitated by his\nfather, and for several minutes nothing was heard but the ticking of the\ngreen-faced case-clock against the wall.\n\n‘I’m sure,’ added Mrs. Smith in a more philosophic tone, and as a\nterminative speech, ‘if there’d been so much trouble to get a husband in\nmy time as there is in these days--when you must make a god-almighty of\na man to get en to hae ye--I’d have trod clay for bricks before I’d ever\nhave lowered my dignity to marry, or there’s no bread in nine loaves.’\n\nThe discussion now dropped, and as it was getting late, Stephen bade his\nparents farewell for the evening, his mother none the less warmly\nfor their sparring; for although Mrs. Smith and Stephen were always\ncontending, they were never at enmity.\n\n‘And possibly,’ said Stephen, ‘I may leave here altogether to-morrow;\nI don’t know. So that if I shouldn’t call again before returning to\nLondon, don’t be alarmed, will you?’\n\n‘But didn’t you come for a fortnight?’ said his mother. ‘And haven’t you\na month’s holiday altogether? They are going to turn you out, then?’\n\n‘Not at all. I may stay longer; I may go. If I go, you had better say\nnothing about my having been here, for her sake. At what time of the\nmorning does the carrier pass Endelstow lane?’\n\n‘Seven o’clock.’\n\nAnd then he left them. His thoughts were, that should the vicar permit\nhim to become engaged, to hope for an engagement, or in any way to think\nof his beloved Elfride, he might stay longer. Should he be forbidden to\nthink of any such thing, he resolved to go at once. And the latter, even\nto young hopefulness, seemed the more probable alternative.\n\nStephen walked back to the vicarage through the meadows, as he had come,\nsurrounded by the soft musical purl of the water through little\nweirs, the modest light of the moon, the freshening smell of the dews\nout-spread around. It was a time when mere seeing is meditation, and\nmeditation peace. Stephen was hardly philosopher enough to avail\nhimself of Nature’s offer. His constitution was made up of very simple\nparticulars; was one which, rare in the spring-time of civilizations,\nseems to grow abundant as a nation gets older, individuality fades,\nand education spreads; that is, his brain had extraordinary receptive\npowers, and no great creativeness. Quickly acquiring any kind of\nknowledge he saw around him, and having a plastic adaptability more\ncommon in woman than in man, he changed colour like a chameleon as the\nsociety he found himself in assumed a higher and more artificial tone.\nHe had not many original ideas, and yet there was scarcely an idea to\nwhich, under proper training, he could not have added a respectable\nco-ordinate.\n\nHe saw nothing outside himself to-night; and what he saw within was a\nweariness to his flesh. Yet to a dispassionate observer, his pretensions\nto Elfride, though rather premature, were far from absurd as marriages\ngo, unless the accidental proximity of simple but honest parents could\nbe said to make them so.\n\nThe clock struck eleven when he entered the house. Elfride had been\nwaiting with scarcely a movement since he departed. Before he had spoken\nto her she caught sight of him passing into the study with her father.\nShe saw that he had by some means obtained the private interview he\ndesired.\n\nA nervous headache had been growing on the excitable girl during the\nabsence of Stephen, and now she could do nothing beyond going up again\nto her room as she had done before. Instead of lying down she sat again\nin the darkness without closing the door, and listened with a beating\nheart to every sound from downstairs. The servants had gone to bed.\nShe ultimately heard the two men come from the study and cross to the\ndining-room, where supper had been lingering for more than an hour. The\ndoor was left open, and she found that the meal, such as it was,\npassed off between her father and her lover without any remark, save\ncommonplaces as to cucumbers and melons, their wholesomeness and\nculture, uttered in a stiff and formal way. It seemed to prefigure\nfailure.\n\nShortly afterwards Stephen came upstairs to his bedroom, and was almost\nimmediately followed by her father, who also retired for the night. Not\ninclined to get a light, she partly undressed and sat on the bed, where\nshe remained in pained thought for some time, possibly an hour. Then\nrising to close her door previously to fully unrobing, she saw a streak\nof light shining across the landing. Her father’s door was shut, and he\ncould be heard snoring regularly. The light came from Stephen’s room,\nand the slight sounds also coming thence emphatically denoted what he\nwas doing. In the perfect silence she could hear the closing of a lid\nand the clicking of a lock,--he was fastening his hat-box. Then the\nbuckling of straps and the click of another key,--he was securing his\nportmanteau. With trebled foreboding she opened her door softly, and\nwent towards his. One sensation pervaded her to distraction. Stephen,\nher handsome youth and darling, was going away, and she might never see\nhim again except in secret and in sadness--perhaps never more. At any\nrate, she could no longer wait till the morning to hear the result of\nthe interview, as she had intended. She flung her dressing-gown round\nher, tapped lightly at his door, and whispered ‘Stephen!’ He came\ninstantly, opened the door, and stepped out.\n\n‘Tell me; are we to hope?’\n\nHe replied in a disturbed whisper, and a tear approached its outlet,\nthough none fell.\n\n‘I am not to think of such a preposterous thing--that’s what he said.\nAnd I am going to-morrow. I should have called you up to bid you\ngood-bye.’\n\n‘But he didn’t say you were to go--O Stephen, he didn’t say that?’\n\n‘No; not in words. But I cannot stay.’\n\n‘Oh, don’t, don’t go! Do come and let us talk. Let us come down to the\ndrawing-room for a few minutes; he will hear us here.’\n\nShe preceded him down the staircase with the taper light in her\nhand, looking unnaturally tall and thin in the long dove-coloured\ndressing-gown she wore. She did not stop to think of the propriety\nor otherwise of this midnight interview under such circumstances. She\nthought that the tragedy of her life was beginning, and, for the first\ntime almost, felt that her existence might have a grave side, the shade\nof which enveloped and rendered invisible the delicate gradations of\ncustom and punctilio. Elfride softly opened the drawing-room door and\nthey both went in. When she had placed the candle on the table, he\nenclosed her with his arms, dried her eyes with his handkerchief, and\nkissed their lids.\n\n‘Stephen, it is over--happy love is over; and there is no more sunshine\nnow!’\n\n‘I will make a fortune, and come to you, and have you. Yes, I will!’\n\n‘Papa will never hear of it--never--never! You don’t know him. I do.\nHe is either biassed in favour of a thing, or prejudiced against it.\nArgument is powerless against either feeling.’\n\n‘No; I won’t think of him so,’ said Stephen. ‘If I appear before him\nsome time hence as a man of established name, he will accept me--I know\nhe will. He is not a wicked man.’\n\n‘No, he is not wicked. But you say “some time hence,” as if it were no\ntime. To you, among bustle and excitement, it will be comparatively\na short time, perhaps; oh, to me, it will be its real length trebled!\nEvery summer will be a year--autumn a year--winter a year! O Stephen!\nand you may forget me!’\n\nForget: that was, and is, the real sting of waiting to fond-hearted\nwoman. The remark awoke in Stephen the converse fear. ‘You, too, may be\npersuaded to give me up, when time has made me fainter in your memory.\nFor, remember, your love for me must be nourished in secret; there will\nbe no long visits from me to support you. Circumstances will always tend\nto obliterate me.’\n\n‘Stephen,’ she said, filled with her own misgivings, and unheeding his\nlast words, ‘there are beautiful women where you live--of course I know\nthere are--and they may win you away from me.’ Her tears came visibly\nas she drew a mental picture of his faithlessness. ‘And it won’t be your\nfault,’ she continued, looking into the candle with doleful eyes. ‘No!\nYou will think that our family don’t want you, and get to include me\nwith them. And there will be a vacancy in your heart, and some others\nwill be let in.’\n\n‘I could not, I would not. Elfie, do not be so full of forebodings.’\n\n‘Oh yes, they will,’ she replied. ‘And you will look at them, not caring\nat first, and then you will look and be interested, and after a while\nyou will think, “Ah, they know all about city life, and assemblies, and\ncoteries, and the manners of the titled, and poor little Elfie, with all\nthe fuss that’s made about her having me, doesn’t know about anything\nbut a little house and a few cliffs and a space of sea, far away.” And\nthen you’ll be more interested in them, and they’ll make you have them\ninstead of me, on purpose to be cruel to me because I am silly, and they\nare clever and hate me. And I hate them, too; yes, I do!’\n\nHer impulsive words had power to impress him at any rate with the\nrecognition of the uncertainty of all that is not accomplished. And,\nworse than that general feeling, there of course remained the sadness\nwhich arose from the special features of his own case. However remote a\ndesired issue may be, the mere fact of having entered the groove which\nleads to it, cheers to some extent with a sense of accomplishment. Had\nMr. Swancourt consented to an engagement of no less length than ten\nyears, Stephen would have been comparatively cheerful in waiting; they\nwould have felt that they were somewhere on the road to Cupid’s garden.\nBut, with a possibility of a shorter probation, they had not as yet any\nprospect of the beginning; the zero of hope had yet to be reached. Mr.\nSwancourt would have to revoke his formidable words before the waiting\nfor marriage could even set in. And this was despair.\n\n‘I wish we could marry now,’ murmured Stephen, as an impossible fancy.\n\n‘So do I,’ said she also, as if regarding an idle dream. ‘’Tis the only\nthing that ever does sweethearts good!’\n\n‘Secretly would do, would it not, Elfie?’\n\n‘Yes, secretly would do; secretly would indeed be best,’ she said, and\nwent on reflectively: ‘All we want is to render it absolutely impossible\nfor any future circumstance to upset our future intention of being happy\ntogether; not to begin being happy now.’\n\n‘Exactly,’ he murmured in a voice and manner the counterpart of hers.\n‘To marry and part secretly, and live on as we are living now; merely to\nput it out of anybody’s power to force you away from me, dearest.’\n\n‘Or you away from me, Stephen.’\n\n‘Or me from you. It is possible to conceive a force of circumstance\nstrong enough to make any woman in the world marry against her will: no\nconceivable pressure, up to torture or starvation, can make a woman once\nmarried to her lover anybody else’s wife.’\n\nNow up to this point the idea of an immediate secret marriage had been\nheld by both as an untenable hypothesis, wherewith simply to beguile a\nmiserable moment. During a pause which followed Stephen’s last remark,\na fascinating perception, then an alluring conviction, flashed along the\nbrain of both. The perception was that an immediate marriage COULD be\ncontrived; the conviction that such an act, in spite of its daring, its\nfathomless results, its deceptiveness, would be preferred by each to the\nlife they must lead under any other conditions.\n\nThe youth spoke first, and his voice trembled with the magnitude of the\nconception he was cherishing. ‘How strong we should feel, Elfride!\ngoing on our separate courses as before, without the fear of ultimate\nseparation! O Elfride! think of it; think of it!’\n\nIt is certain that the young girl’s love for Stephen received a fanning\nfrom her father’s opposition which made it blaze with a dozen times the\nintensity it would have exhibited if left alone. Never were conditions\nmore favourable for developing a girl’s first passing fancy for a\nhandsome boyish face--a fancy rooted in inexperience and nourished by\nseclusion--into a wild unreflecting passion fervid enough for anything.\nAll the elements of such a development were there, the chief one being\nhopelessness--a necessary ingredient always to perfect the mixture of\nfeelings united under the name of loving to distraction.\n\n‘We would tell papa soon, would we not?’ she inquired timidly. ‘Nobody\nelse need know. He would then be convinced that hearts cannot be played\nwith; love encouraged be ready to grow, love discouraged be ready to\ndie, at a moment’s notice. Stephen, do you not think that if marriages\nagainst a parent’s consent are ever justifiable, they are when young\npeople have been favoured up to a point, as we have, and then have had\nthat favour suddenly withdrawn?’\n\n‘Yes. It is not as if we had from the beginning acted in opposition to\nyour papa’s wishes. Only think, Elfie, how pleasant he was towards me\nbut six hours ago! He liked me, praised me, never objected to my being\nalone with you.’\n\n‘I believe he MUST like you now,’ she cried. ‘And if he found that you\nirremediably belonged to me, he would own it and help you. ‘O Stephen,\nStephen,’ she burst out again, as the remembrance of his packing came\nafresh to her mind, ‘I cannot bear your going away like this! It is\ntoo dreadful. All I have been expecting miserably killed within me like\nthis!’\n\nStephen flushed hot with impulse. ‘I will not be a doubt to you--thought\nof you shall not be a misery to me!’ he said. ‘We will be wife and\nhusband before we part for long!’\n\nShe hid her face on his shoulder. ‘Anything to make SURE!’ she\nwhispered.\n\n‘I did not like to propose it immediately,’ continued Stephen. ‘It\nseemed to me--it seems to me now--like trying to catch you--a girl\nbetter in the world than I.’\n\n‘Not that, indeed! And am I better in worldly station? What’s the use of\nhave beens? We may have been something once; we are nothing now.’\n\nThen they whispered long and earnestly together; Stephen hesitatingly\nproposing this and that plan, Elfride modifying them, with quick\nbreathings, and hectic flush, and unnaturally bright eyes. It was two\no’clock before an arrangement was finally concluded.\n\nShe then told him to leave her, giving him his light to go up to his own\nroom. They parted with an agreement not to meet again in the morning.\nAfter his door had been some time closed he heard her softly gliding\ninto her chamber.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XI\n\n     ‘Journeys end in lovers meeting.’\n\n\nStephen lay watching the Great Bear; Elfride was regarding a monotonous\nparallelogram of window blind. Neither slept that night.\n\nEarly the next morning--that is to say, four hours after their\nstolen interview, and just as the earliest servant was heard moving\nabout--Stephen Smith went downstairs, portmanteau in hand. Throughout\nthe night he had intended to see Mr. Swancourt again, but the sharp\nrebuff of the previous evening rendered such an interview particularly\ndistasteful. Perhaps there was another and less honest reason. He\ndecided to put it off. Whatever of moral timidity or obliquity may have\nlain in such a decision, no perception of it was strong enough to detain\nhim. He wrote a note in his room, which stated simply that he did not\nfeel happy in the house after Mr. Swancourt’s sudden veto on what he had\nfavoured a few hours before; but that he hoped a time would come, and\nthat soon, when his original feelings of pleasure as Mr. Swancourt’s\nguest might be recovered.\n\nHe expected to find the downstairs rooms wearing the gray and cheerless\naspect that early morning gives to everything out of the sun. He\nfound in the dining room a breakfast laid, of which somebody had just\npartaken.\n\nStephen gave the maid-servant his note of adieu. She stated that Mr.\nSwancourt had risen early that morning, and made an early breakfast. He\nwas not going away that she knew of.\n\nStephen took a cup of coffee, left the house of his love, and turned\ninto the lane. It was so early that the shaded places still smelt like\nnight time, and the sunny spots had hardly felt the sun. The horizontal\nrays made every shallow dip in the ground to show as a well-marked\nhollow. Even the channel of the path was enough to throw shade, and the\nvery stones of the road cast tapering dashes of darkness westward, as\nlong as Jael’s tent-nail.\n\nAt a spot not more than a hundred yards from the vicar’s residence the\nlane leading thence crossed the high road. Stephen reached the point of\nintersection, stood still and listened. Nothing could be heard save the\nlengthy, murmuring line of the sea upon the adjacent shore. He looked\nat his watch, and then mounted a gate upon which he seated himself, to\nawait the arrival of the carrier. Whilst he sat he heard wheels coming\nin two directions.\n\nThe vehicle approaching on his right he soon recognized as the\ncarrier’s. There were the accompanying sounds of the owner’s voice and\nthe smack of his whip, distinct in the still morning air, by which he\nencouraged his horses up the hill.\n\nThe other set of wheels sounded from the lane Stephen had just\ntraversed. On closer observation, he perceived that they were moving\nfrom the precincts of the ancient manor-house adjoining the vicarage\ngrounds. A carriage then left the entrance gates of the house, and\nwheeling round came fully in sight. It was a plain travelling carriage,\nwith a small quantity of luggage, apparently a lady’s. The vehicle\ncame to the junction of the four ways half-a-minute before the carrier\nreached the same spot, and crossed directly in his front, proceeding by\nthe lane on the other side.\n\nInside the carriage Stephen could just discern an elderly lady with a\nyounger woman, who seemed to be her maid. The road they had taken led to\nStratleigh, a small watering-place sixteen miles north.\n\nHe heard the manor-house gates swing again, and looking up saw another\nperson leaving them, and walking off in the direction of the parsonage.\n‘Ah, how much I wish I were moving that way!’ felt he parenthetically.\nThe gentleman was tall, and resembled Mr. Swancourt in outline and\nattire. He opened the vicarage gate and went in. Mr. Swancourt, then,\nit certainly was. Instead of remaining in bed that morning Mr. Swancourt\nmust have taken it into his head to see his new neighbour off on a\njourney. He must have been greatly interested in that neighbour to do\nsuch an unusual thing.\n\nThe carrier’s conveyance had pulled up, and Stephen now handed in his\nportmanteau and mounted the shafts. ‘Who is that lady in the carriage?’\nhe inquired indifferently of Lickpan the carrier.\n\n‘That, sir, is Mrs. Troyton, a widder wi’ a mint o’ money. She’s the\nowner of all that part of Endelstow that is not Lord Luxellian’s. Only\nbeen here a short time; she came into it by law. The owner formerly was\na terrible mysterious party--never lived here--hardly ever was seen here\nexcept in the month of September, as I might say.’\n\nThe horses were started again, and noise rendered further discourse a\nmatter of too great exertion. Stephen crept inside under the tilt, and\nwas soon lost in reverie.\n\nThree hours and a half of straining up hills and jogging down brought\nthem to St. Launce’s, the market town and railway station nearest to\nEndelstow, and the place from which Stephen Smith had journeyed over the\ndowns on the, to him, memorable winter evening at the beginning of\nthe same year. The carrier’s van was so timed as to meet a starting\nup-train, which Stephen entered. Two or three hours’ railway travel\nthrough vertical cuttings in metamorphic rock, through oak copses rich\nand green, stretching over slopes and down delightful valleys, glens,\nand ravines, sparkling with water like many-rilled Ida, and he plunged\namid the hundred and fifty thousand people composing the town of\nPlymouth.\n\nThere being some time upon his hands he left his luggage at the\ncloak-room, and went on foot along Bedford Street to the nearest church.\nHere Stephen wandered among the multifarious tombstones and looked in at\nthe chancel window, dreaming of something that was likely to happen by\nthe altar there in the course of the coming month. He turned away and\nascended the Hoe, viewed the magnificent stretch of sea and massive\npromontories of land, but without particularly discerning one feature of\nthe varied perspective. He still saw that inner prospect--the event\nhe hoped for in yonder church. The wide Sound, the Breakwater, the\nlight-house on far-off Eddystone, the dark steam vessels, brigs,\nbarques, and schooners, either floating stilly, or gliding with tiniest\nmotion, were as the dream, then; the dreamed-of event was as the\nreality.\n\nSoon Stephen went down from the Hoe, and returned to the railway\nstation. He took his ticket, and entered the London train.\n\n\nThat day was an irksome time at Endelstow vicarage. Neither father nor\ndaughter alluded to the departure of Stephen. Mr. Swancourt’s manner\ntowards her partook of the compunctious kindness that arises from a\nmisgiving as to the justice of some previous act.\n\nEither from lack of the capacity to grasp the whole coup d’oeil, or from\na natural endowment for certain kinds of stoicism, women are cooler than\nmen in critical situations of the passive form. Probably, in Elfride’s\ncase at least, it was blindness to the greater contingencies of the\nfuture she was preparing for herself, which enabled her to ask her\nfather in a quiet voice if he could give her a holiday soon, to ride to\nSt. Launce’s and go on to Plymouth.\n\nNow, she had only once before gone alone to Plymouth, and that was in\nconsequence of some unavoidable difficulty. Being a country girl, and a\ngood, not to say a wild, horsewoman, it had been her delight to canter,\nwithout the ghost of an attendant, over the fourteen or sixteen miles\nof hard road intervening between their home and the station at St.\nLaunce’s, put up the horse, and go on the remainder of the distance by\ntrain, returning in the same manner in the evening. It was then resolved\nthat, though she had successfully accomplished this journey once, it was\nnot to be repeated without some attendance.\n\nBut Elfride must not be confounded with ordinary young feminine\nequestrians. The circumstances of her lonely and narrow life made it\nimperative that in trotting about the neighbourhood she must trot\nalone or else not at all. Usage soon rendered this perfectly natural to\nherself. Her father, who had had other experiences, did not much like\nthe idea of a Swancourt, whose pedigree could be as distinctly traced as\na thread in a skein of silk, scampering over the hills like a farmer’s\ndaughter, even though he could habitually neglect her. But what with\nhis not being able to afford her a regular attendant, and his inveterate\nhabit of letting anything be to save himself trouble, the circumstance\ngrew customary. And so there arose a chronic notion in the villagers’\nminds that all ladies rode without an attendant, like Miss Swancourt,\nexcept a few who were sometimes visiting at Lord Luxellian’s.\n\n‘I don’t like your going to Plymouth alone, particularly going to St.\nLaunce’s on horseback. Why not drive, and take the man?’\n\n‘It is not nice to be so overlooked.’ Worm’s company would not seriously\nhave interfered with her plans, but it was her humour to go without him.\n\n‘When do you want to go?’ said her father.\n\nShe only answered, ‘Soon.’\n\n‘I will consider,’ he said.\n\nOnly a few days elapsed before she asked again. A letter had reached\nher from Stephen. It had been timed to come on that day by special\narrangement between them. In it he named the earliest morning on which\nhe could meet her at Plymouth. Her father had been on a journey to\nStratleigh, and returned in unusual buoyancy of spirit. It was a good\nopportunity; and since the dismissal of Stephen her father had been\ngenerally in a mood to make small concessions, that he might steer clear\nof large ones connected with that outcast lover of hers.\n\n‘Next Thursday week I am going from home in a different direction,’ said\nher father. ‘In fact, I shall leave home the night before. You might\nchoose the same day, for they wish to take up the carpets, or some such\nthing, I think. As I said, I don’t like you to be seen in a town on\nhorseback alone; but go if you will.’\n\nThursday week. Her father had named the very day that Stephen also had\nnamed that morning as the earliest on which it would be of any use to\nmeet her; that was, about fifteen days from the day on which he had left\nEndelstow. Fifteen days--that fragment of duration which has acquired\nsuch an interesting individuality from its connection with the English\nmarriage law.\n\nShe involuntarily looked at her father so strangely, that on becoming\nconscious of the look she paled with embarrassment. Her father, too,\nlooked confused. What was he thinking of?\n\nThere seemed to be a special facility offered her by a power external\nto herself in the circumstance that Mr. Swancourt had proposed to leave\nhome the night previous to her wished-for day. Her father seldom took\nlong journeys; seldom slept from home except perhaps on the night\nfollowing a remote Visitation. Well, she would not inquire too curiously\ninto the reason of the opportunity, nor did he, as would have been\nnatural, proceed to explain it of his own accord. In matters of fact\nthere had hitherto been no reserve between them, though they were not\nusually confidential in its full sense. But the divergence of their\nemotions on Stephen’s account had produced an estrangement which just\nat present went even to the extent of reticence on the most ordinary\nhousehold topics.\n\nElfride was almost unconsciously relieved, persuading herself that her\nfather’s reserve on his business justified her in secrecy as regarded\nher own--a secrecy which was necessarily a foregone decision with her.\nSo anxious is a young conscience to discover a palliative, that the ex\npost facto nature of a reason is of no account in excluding it.\n\nThe intervening fortnight was spent by her mostly in walking by\nherself among the shrubs and trees, indulging sometimes in sanguine\nanticipations; more, far more frequently, in misgivings. All her flowers\nseemed dull of hue; her pets seemed to look wistfully into her eyes,\nas if they no longer stood in the same friendly relation to her as\nformerly. She wore melancholy jewellery, gazed at sunsets, and talked to\nold men and women. It was the first time that she had had an inner and\nprivate world apart from the visible one about her. She wished that her\nfather, instead of neglecting her even more than usual, would make some\nadvance--just one word; she would then tell all, and risk Stephen’s\ndispleasure. Thus brought round to the youth again, she saw him in\nher fancy, standing, touching her, his eyes full of sad affection,\nhopelessly renouncing his attempt because she had renounced hers; and\nshe could not recede.\n\nOn the Wednesday she was to receive another letter. She had resolved\nto let her father see the arrival of this one, be the consequences\nwhat they might: the dread of losing her lover by this deed of honesty\nprevented her acting upon the resolve. Five minutes before the postman’s\nexpected arrival she slipped out, and down the lane to meet him. She met\nhim immediately upon turning a sharp angle, which hid her from view in\nthe direction of the vicarage. The man smilingly handed one missive, and\nwas going on to hand another, a circular from some tradesman.\n\n‘No,’ she said; ‘take that on to the house.’\n\n‘Why, miss, you are doing what your father has done for the last\nfortnight.’\n\nShe did not comprehend.\n\n‘Why, come to this corner, and take a letter of me every morning, all\nwrit in the same handwriting, and letting any others for him go on to\nthe house.’ And on the postman went.\n\nNo sooner had he turned the corner behind her back than she heard\nher father meet and address the man. She had saved her letter by two\nminutes. Her father audibly went through precisely the same performance\nas she had just been guilty of herself.\n\nThis stealthy conduct of his was, to say the least, peculiar.\n\n\nGiven an impulsive inconsequent girl, neglected as to her inner life by\nher only parent, and the following forces alive within her; to determine\na resultant:\n\nFirst love acted upon by a deadly fear of separation from its object:\ninexperience, guiding onward a frantic wish to prevent the above-named\nissue: misgivings as to propriety, met by hope of ultimate exoneration:\nindignation at parental inconsistency in first encouraging, then\nforbidding: a chilling sense of disobedience, overpowered by a\nconscientious inability to brook a breaking of plighted faith with a man\nwho, in essentials, had remained unaltered from the beginning: a blessed\nhope that opposition would turn an erroneous judgement: a bright faith\nthat things would mend thereby, and wind up well.\n\nProbably the result would, after all, have been nil, had not the\nfollowing few remarks been made one day at breakfast.\n\nHer father was in his old hearty spirits. He smiled to himself\nat stories too bad to tell, and called Elfride a little scamp for\nsurreptitiously preserving some blind kittens that ought to have been\ndrowned. After this expression, she said to him suddenly:\n\n‘If Mr. Smith had been already in the family, you would not have been\nmade wretched by discovering he had poor relations?’\n\n‘Do you mean in the family by marriage?’ he replied inattentively, and\ncontinuing to peel his egg.\n\nThe accumulating scarlet told that was her meaning, as much as the\naffirmative reply.\n\n‘I should have put up with it, no doubt,’ Mr. Swancourt observed.\n\n‘So that you would not have been driven into hopeless melancholy, but\nhave made the best of him?’\n\nElfride’s erratic mind had from her youth upwards been constantly in\nthe habit of perplexing her father by hypothetical questions, based on\nabsurd conditions. The present seemed to be cast so precisely in\nthe mould of previous ones that, not being given to syntheses of\ncircumstances, he answered it with customary complacency.\n\n‘If he were allied to us irretrievably, of course I, or any sensible\nman, should accept conditions that could not be altered; certainly not\nbe hopelessly melancholy about it. I don’t believe anything in the world\nwould make me hopelessly melancholy. And don’t let anything make you so,\neither.’\n\n‘I won’t, papa,’ she cried, with a serene brightness that pleased him.\n\nCertainly Mr. Swancourt must have been far from thinking that the\nbrightness came from an exhilarating intention to hold back no longer\nfrom the mad action she had planned.\n\nIn the evening he drove away towards Stratleigh, quite alone. It was\nan unusual course for him. At the door Elfride had been again almost\nimpelled by her feelings to pour out all.\n\n‘Why are you going to Stratleigh, papa?’ she said, and looked at him\nlongingly.\n\n‘I will tell you to-morrow when I come back,’ he said cheerily; ‘not\nbefore then, Elfride. Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know, and\nso far will I trust thee, gentle Elfride.’\n\nShe was repressed and hurt.\n\n‘I will tell you my errand to Plymouth, too, when I come back,’ she\nmurmured.\n\nHe went away. His jocularity made her intention seem the lighter, as his\nindifference made her more resolved to do as she liked.\n\nIt was a familiar September sunset, dark-blue fragments of cloud upon an\norange-yellow sky. These sunsets used to tempt her to walk towards them,\nas any beautiful thing tempts a near approach. She went through the\nfield to the privet hedge, clambered into the middle of it, and reclined\nupon the thick boughs. After looking westward for a considerable time,\nshe blamed herself for not looking eastward to where Stephen was, and\nturned round. Ultimately her eyes fell upon the ground.\n\nA peculiarity was observable beneath her. A green field spread itself\non each side of the hedge, one belonging to the glebe, the other being a\npart of the land attached to the manor-house adjoining. On the\nvicarage side she saw a little footpath, the distinctive and altogether\nexceptional feature of which consisted in its being only about ten yards\nlong; it terminated abruptly at each end.\n\nA footpath, suddenly beginning and suddenly ending, coming from nowhere\nand leading nowhere, she had never seen before.\n\nYes, she had, on second thoughts. She had seen exactly such a path\ntrodden in the front of barracks by the sentry.\n\nAnd this recollection explained the origin of the path here. Her father\nhad trodden it by pacing up and down, as she had once seen him doing.\n\nSitting on the hedge as she sat now, her eyes commanded a view of both\nsides of it. And a few minutes later, Elfride looked over to the manor\nside.\n\nHere was another sentry path. It was like the first in length, and\nit began and ended exactly opposite the beginning and ending of its\nneighbour, but it was thinner, and less distinct.\n\nTwo reasons existed for the difference. This one might have been trodden\nby a similar weight of tread to the other, exercised a less number of\ntimes; or it might have been walked just as frequently, but by lighter\nfeet.\n\nProbably a gentleman from Scotland-yard, had he been passing at the\ntime, might have considered the latter alternative as the more probable.\nElfride thought otherwise, so far as she thought at all. But her own\ngreat To-Morrow was now imminent; all thoughts inspired by casual sights\nof the eye were only allowed to exercise themselves in inferior corners\nof her brain, previously to being banished altogether.\n\nElfride was at length compelled to reason practically upon her\nundertaking. All her definite perceptions thereon, when the emotion\naccompanying them was abstracted, amounted to no more than these:\n\n‘Say an hour and three-quarters to ride to St. Launce’s.\n\n‘Say half an hour at the Falcon to change my dress.\n\n‘Say two hours waiting for some train and getting to Plymouth.\n\n‘Say an hour to spare before twelve o’clock.\n\n‘Total time from leaving Endelstow till twelve o’clock, five hours.\n\n‘Therefore I shall have to start at seven.’\n\n\nNo surprise or sense of unwontedness entered the minds of the servants\nat her early ride. The monotony of life we associate with people of\nsmall incomes in districts out of the sound of the railway whistle, has\none exception, which puts into shade the experience of dwellers about\nthe great centres of population--that is, in travelling. Every journey\nthere is more or less an adventure; adventurous hours are necessarily\nchosen for the most commonplace outing. Miss Elfride had to leave\nearly--that was all.\n\nElfride never went out on horseback but she brought home\nsomething--something found, or something bought. If she trotted to town\nor village, her burden was books. If to hills, woods, or the seashore,\nit was wonderful mosses, abnormal twigs, a handkerchief of wet shells or\nseaweed.\n\nOnce, in muddy weather, when Pansy was walking with her down the street\nof Castle Boterel, on a fair-day, a packet in front of her and a packet\nunder her arm, an accident befell the packets, and they slipped down.\nOn one side of her, three volumes of fiction lay kissing the mud; on\nthe other numerous skeins of polychromatic wools lay absorbing it.\nUnpleasant women smiled through windows at the mishap, the men all\nlooked round, and a boy, who was minding a ginger-bread stall whilst\nthe owner had gone to get drunk, laughed loudly. The blue eyes turned to\nsapphires, and the cheeks crimsoned with vexation.\n\nAfter that misadventure she set her wits to work, and was ingenious\nenough to invent an arrangement of small straps about the saddle, by\nwhich a great deal could be safely carried thereon, in a small compass.\nHere she now spread out and fastened a plain dark walking-dress and\na few other trifles of apparel. Worm opened the gate for her, and she\nvanished away.\n\nOne of the brightest mornings of late summer shone upon her. The heather\nwas at its purplest, the furze at its yellowest, the grasshoppers\nchirped loud enough for birds, the snakes hissed like little engines,\nand Elfride at first felt lively. Sitting at ease upon Pansy, in her\northodox riding-habit and nondescript hat, she looked what she felt. But\nthe mercury of those days had a trick of falling unexpectedly. First,\nonly for one minute in ten had she a sense of depression. Then a large\ncloud, that had been hanging in the north like a black fleece, came and\nplaced itself between her and the sun. It helped on what was already\ninevitable, and she sank into a uniformity of sadness.\n\nShe turned in the saddle and looked back. They were now on an open\ntable-land, whose altitude still gave her a view of the sea by\nEndelstow. She looked longingly at that spot.\n\nDuring this little revulsion of feeling Pansy had been still advancing,\nand Elfride felt it would be absurd to turn her little mare’s head the\nother way. ‘Still,’ she thought, ‘if I had a mamma at home I WOULD go\nback!’\n\nAnd making one of those stealthy movements by which women let their\nhearts juggle with their brains, she did put the horse’s head about, as\nif unconsciously, and went at a hand-gallop towards home for more than\na mile. By this time, from the inveterate habit of valuing what we\nhave renounced directly the alternative is chosen, the thought of her\nforsaken Stephen recalled her, and she turned about, and cantered on to\nSt. Launce’s again.\n\nThis miserable strife of thought now began to rage in all its wildness.\nOverwrought and trembling, she dropped the rein upon Pansy’s shoulders,\nand vowed she would be led whither the horse would take her.\n\nPansy slackened her pace to a walk, and walked on with her agitated\nburden for three or four minutes. At the expiration of this time they\nhad come to a little by-way on the right, leading down a slope to a pool\nof water. The pony stopped, looked towards the pool, and then advanced\nand stooped to drink.\n\nElfride looked at her watch and discovered that if she were going to\nreach St. Launce’s early enough to change her dress at the Falcon,\nand get a chance of some early train to Plymouth--there were only two\navailable--it was necessary to proceed at once.\n\nShe was impatient. It seemed as if Pansy would never stop drinking; and\nthe repose of the pool, the idle motions of the insects and flies upon\nit, the placid waving of the flags, the leaf-skeletons, like Genoese\nfiligree, placidly sleeping at the bottom, by their contrast with her\nown turmoil made her impatience greater.\n\nPansy did turn at last, and went up the slope again to the high-road.\nThe pony came upon it, and stood cross-wise, looking up and down.\nElfride’s heart throbbed erratically, and she thought, ‘Horses, if left\nto themselves, make for where they are best fed. Pansy will go home.’\n\nPansy turned and walked on towards St. Launce’s\n\nPansy at home, during summer, had little but grass to live on. After a\nrun to St. Launce’s she always had a feed of corn to support her on the\nreturn journey. Therefore, being now more than half way, she preferred\nSt. Launce’s.\n\nBut Elfride did not remember this now. All she cared to recognize was a\ndreamy fancy that to-day’s rash action was not her own. She was disabled\nby her moods, and it seemed indispensable to adhere to the programme.\nSo strangely involved are motives that, more than by her promise to\nStephen, more even than by her love, she was forced on by a sense of the\nnecessity of keeping faith with herself, as promised in the inane vow of\nten minutes ago.\n\nShe hesitated no longer. Pansy went, like the steed of Adonis, as if\nshe told the steps. Presently the quaint gables and jumbled roofs of St.\nLaunce’s were spread beneath her, and going down the hill she entered\nthe courtyard of the Falcon. Mrs. Buckle, the landlady, came to the door\nto meet her.\n\nThe Swancourts were well known here. The transition from equestrian\nto the ordinary guise of railway travellers had been more than once\nperformed by father and daughter in this establishment.\n\nIn less than a quarter of an hour Elfride emerged from the door in her\nwalking dress, and went to the railway. She had not told Mrs. Buckle\nanything as to her intentions, and was supposed to have gone out\nshopping.\n\nAn hour and forty minutes later, and she was in Stephen’s arms at the\nPlymouth station. Not upon the platform--in the secret retreat of a\ndeserted waiting-room.\n\nStephen’s face boded ill. He was pale and despondent.\n\n‘What is the matter?’ she asked.\n\n‘We cannot be married here to-day, my Elfie! I ought to have known it\nand stayed here. In my ignorance I did not. I have the licence, but it\ncan only be used in my parish in London. I only came down last night, as\nyou know.’\n\n‘What shall we do?’ she said blankly.\n\n‘There’s only one thing we can do, darling.’\n\n‘What’s that?’\n\n‘Go on to London by a train just starting, and be married there\nto-morrow.’\n\n‘Passengers for the 11.5 up-train take their seats!’ said a guard’s\nvoice on the platform.\n\n‘Will you go, Elfride?’\n\n‘I will.’\n\nIn three minutes the train had moved off, bearing away with it Stephen\nand Elfride.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XII\n\n     ‘Adieu! she cries, and waved her lily hand.’\n\n\nThe few tattered clouds of the morning enlarged and united, the sun\nwithdrew behind them to emerge no more that day, and the evening drew to\na close in drifts of rain. The water-drops beat like duck shot against\nthe window of the railway-carriage containing Stephen and Elfride.\n\nThe journey from Plymouth to Paddington, by even the most headlong\nexpress, allows quite enough leisure for passion of any sort to cool.\nElfride’s excitement had passed off, and she sat in a kind of stupor\nduring the latter half of the journey. She was aroused by the clanging\nof the maze of rails over which they traced their way at the entrance to\nthe station.\n\nIs this London?’ she said.\n\n‘Yes, darling,’ said Stephen in a tone of assurance he was far from\nfeeling. To him, no less than to her, the reality so greatly differed\nfrom the prefiguring.\n\nShe peered out as well as the window, beaded with drops, would allow\nher, and saw only the lamps, which had just been lit, blinking in the\nwet atmosphere, and rows of hideous zinc chimney-pipes in dim relief\nagainst the sky. She writhed uneasily, as when a thought is swelling in\nthe mind which must cause much pain at its deliverance in words. Elfride\nhad known no more about the stings of evil report than the native\nwild-fowl knew of the effects of Crusoe’s first shot. Now she saw a\nlittle further, and a little further still.\n\nThe train stopped. Stephen relinquished the soft hand he had held all\nthe day, and proceeded to assist her on to the platform.\n\nThis act of alighting upon strange ground seemed all that was wanted to\ncomplete a resolution within her.\n\nShe looked at her betrothed with despairing eyes.\n\n‘O Stephen,’ she exclaimed, ‘I am so miserable! I must go home again--I\nmust--I must! Forgive my wretched vacillation. I don’t like it here--nor\nmyself--nor you!’\n\nStephen looked bewildered, and did not speak.\n\n‘Will you allow me to go home?’ she implored. ‘I won’t trouble you to go\nwith me. I will not be any weight upon you; only say you will agree to\nmy returning; that you will not hate me for it, Stephen! It is better\nthat I should return again; indeed it is, Stephen.’\n\n‘But we can’t return now,’ he said in a deprecatory tone.\n\n‘I must! I will!’\n\n‘How? When do you want to go?’\n\n‘Now. Can we go at once?’\n\nThe lad looked hopelessly along the platform.\n\n‘If you must go, and think it wrong to remain, dearest,’ said he sadly,\n‘you shall. You shall do whatever you like, my Elfride. But would you in\nreality rather go now than stay till to-morrow, and go as my wife?’\n\n‘Yes, yes--much--anything to go now. I must; I must!’ she cried.\n\n‘We ought to have done one of two things,’ he answered gloomily. ‘Never\nto have started, or not to have returned without being married. I don’t\nlike to say it, Elfride--indeed I don’t; but you must be told this, that\ngoing back unmarried may compromise your good name in the eyes of people\nwho may hear of it.’\n\n‘They will not; and I must go.’\n\n‘O Elfride! I am to blame for bringing you away.’\n\n‘Not at all. I am the elder.’\n\n‘By a month; and what’s that? But never mind that now.’ He looked\naround. ‘Is there a train for Plymouth to-night?’ he inquired of a\nguard. The guard passed on and did not speak.\n\n‘Is there a train for Plymouth to-night?’ said Elfride to another.\n\n‘Yes, miss; the 8.10--leaves in ten minutes. You have come to the wrong\nplatform; it is the other side. Change at Bristol into the night mail.\nDown that staircase, and under the line.’\n\nThey ran down the staircase--Elfride first--to the booking-office, and\ninto a carriage with an official standing beside the door. ‘Show your\ntickets, please.’ They are locked in--men about the platform accelerate\ntheir velocities till they fly up and down like shuttles in a loom--a\nwhistle--the waving of a flag--a human cry--a steam groan--and away they\ngo to Plymouth again, just catching these words as they glide off:\n\n‘Those two youngsters had a near run for it, and no mistake!’\n\nElfride found her breath.\n\n‘And have you come too, Stephen? Why did you?’\n\n‘I shall not leave you till I see you safe at St. Launce’s. Do not think\nworse of me than I am, Elfride.’\n\nAnd then they rattled along through the night, back again by the way\nthey had come. The weather cleared, and the stars shone in upon them.\nTheir two or three fellow-passengers sat for most of the time with\nclosed eyes. Stephen sometimes slept; Elfride alone was wakeful and\npalpitating hour after hour.\n\nThe day began to break, and revealed that they were by the sea. Red\nrocks overhung them, and, receding into distance, grew livid in the blue\ngrey atmosphere. The sun rose, and sent penetrating shafts of light in\nupon their weary faces. Another hour, and the world began to be busy.\nThey waited yet a little, and the train slackened its speed in view of\nthe platform at St. Launce’s.\n\nShe shivered, and mused sadly.\n\n‘I did not see all the consequences,’ she said. ‘Appearances are wofully\nagainst me. If anybody finds me out, I am, I suppose, disgraced.’\n\n‘Then appearances will speak falsely; and how can that matter, even if\nthey do? I shall be your husband sooner or later, for certain, and so\nprove your purity.’\n\n‘Stephen, once in London I ought to have married you,’ she said\nfirmly. ‘It was my only safe defence. I see more things now than I did\nyesterday. My only remaining chance is not to be discovered; and that we\nmust fight for most desperately.’\n\nThey stepped out. Elfride pulled a thick veil over her face.\n\nA woman with red and scaly eyelids and glistening eyes was sitting on a\nbench just inside the office-door. She fixed her eyes upon Elfride with\nan expression whose force it was impossible to doubt, but the meaning of\nwhich was not clear; then upon the carriage they had left. She seemed to\nread a sinister story in the scene.\n\nElfride shrank back, and turned the other way.\n\n‘Who is that woman?’ said Stephen. ‘She looked hard at you.’\n\n‘Mrs. Jethway--a widow, and mother of that young man whose tomb we sat\non the other night. Stephen, she is my enemy. Would that God had had\nmercy enough upon me to have hidden this from HER!’\n\n‘Do not talk so hopelessly,’ he remonstrated. ‘I don’t think she\nrecognized us.’\n\n‘I pray that she did not.’\n\nHe put on a more vigorous mood.\n\n‘Now, we will go and get some breakfast.’\n\n‘No, no!’ she begged. ‘I cannot eat. I MUST get back to Endelstow.’\n\nElfride was as if she had grown years older than Stephen now.\n\n‘But you have had nothing since last night but that cup of tea at\nBristol.’\n\n‘I can’t eat, Stephen.’\n\n‘Wine and biscuit?’\n\n‘No.’\n\n‘Nor tea, nor coffee?’\n\n‘No.’\n\n‘A glass of water?’\n\n‘No. I want something that makes people strong and energetic for the\npresent, that borrows the strength of to-morrow for use to-day--leaving\nto-morrow without any at all for that matter; or even that would take\nall life away to-morrow, so long as it enabled me to get home again now.\nBrandy, that’s what I want. That woman’s eyes have eaten my heart away!’\n\n‘You are wild; and you grieve me, darling. Must it be brandy?’\n\n‘Yes, if you please.’\n\n‘How much?’\n\n‘I don’t know. I have never drunk more than a teaspoonful at once. All I\nknow is that I want it. Don’t get it at the Falcon.’\n\nHe left her in the fields, and went to the nearest inn in that\ndirection. Presently he returned with a small flask nearly full, and\nsome slices of bread-and-butter, thin as wafers, in a paper-bag. Elfride\ntook a sip or two.\n\n‘It goes into my eyes,’ she said wearily. ‘I can’t take any more. Yes,\nI will; I will close my eyes. Ah, it goes to them by an inside route. I\ndon’t want it; throw it away.’\n\nHowever, she could eat, and did eat. Her chief attention was\nconcentrated upon how to get the horse from the Falcon stables without\nsuspicion. Stephen was not allowed to accompany her into the town. She\nacted now upon conclusions reached without any aid from him: his power\nover her seemed to have departed.\n\n‘You had better not be seen with me, even here where I am so little\nknown. We have begun stealthily as thieves, and we must end stealthily\nas thieves, at all hazards. Until papa has been told by me myself, a\ndiscovery would be terrible.’\n\nWalking and gloomily talking thus they waited till nearly nine o’clock,\nat which time Elfride thought she might call at the Falcon without\ncreating much surprise. Behind the railway-station was the river,\nspanned by an old Tudor bridge, whence the road diverged in two\ndirections, one skirting the suburbs of the town, and winding round\nagain into the high-road to Endelstow. Beside this road Stephen sat, and\nawaited her return from the Falcon.\n\nHe sat as one sitting for a portrait, motionless, watching the chequered\nlights and shades on the tree-trunks, the children playing opposite the\nschool previous to entering for the morning lesson, the reapers in a\nfield afar off. The certainty of possession had not come, and there was\nnothing to mitigate the youth’s gloom, that increased with the thought\nof the parting now so near.\n\nAt length she came trotting round to him, in appearance much as on the\nromantic morning of their visit to the cliff, but shorn of the radiance\nwhich glistened about her then. However, her comparative immunity\nfrom further risk and trouble had considerably composed her. Elfride’s\ncapacity for being wounded was only surpassed by her capacity for\nhealing, which rightly or wrongly is by some considered an index of\ntransientness of feeling in general.\n\n‘Elfride, what did they say at the Falcon?’\n\n‘Nothing. Nobody seemed curious about me. They knew I went to Plymouth,\nand I have stayed there a night now and then with Miss Bicknell. I\nrather calculated upon that.’\n\nAnd now parting arose like a death to these children, for it was\nimperative that she should start at once. Stephen walked beside her for\nnearly a mile. During the walk he said sadly:\n\n‘Elfride, four-and-twenty hours have passed, and the thing is not done.’\n\n‘But you have insured that it shall be done.’\n\n‘How have I?’\n\n‘O Stephen, you ask how! Do you think I could marry another man on earth\nafter having gone thus far with you? Have I not shown beyond possibility\nof doubt that I can be nobody else’s? Have I not irretrievably committed\nmyself?--pride has stood for nothing in the face of my great love. You\nmisunderstood my turning back, and I cannot explain it. It was wrong to\ngo with you at all; and though it would have been worse to go further,\nit would have been better policy, perhaps. Be assured of this, that\nwhenever you have a home for me--however poor and humble--and come and\nclaim me, I am ready.’ She added bitterly, ‘When my father knows of this\nday’s work, he may be only too glad to let me go.’\n\n‘Perhaps he may, then, insist upon our marriage at once!’ Stephen\nanswered, seeing a ray of hope in the very focus of her remorse. ‘I\nhope he may, even if we had still to part till I am ready for you, as we\nintended.’\n\nElfride did not reply.\n\n‘You don’t seem the same woman, Elfie, that you were yesterday.’\n\n‘Nor am I. But good-bye. Go back now.’ And she reined the horse for\nparting. ‘O Stephen,’ she cried, ‘I feel so weak! I don’t know how to\nmeet him. Cannot you, after all, come back with me?’\n\n‘Shall I come?’\n\nElfride paused to think.\n\n‘No; it will not do. It is my utter foolishness that makes me say such\nwords. But he will send for you.’\n\n‘Say to him,’ continued Stephen, ‘that we did this in the absolute\ndespair of our minds. Tell him we don’t wish him to favour us--only to\ndeal justly with us. If he says, marry now, so much the better. If not,\nsay that all may be put right by his promise to allow me to have you\nwhen I am good enough for you--which may be soon. Say I have nothing to\noffer him in exchange for his treasure--the more sorry I; but all the\nlove, and all the life, and all the labour of an honest man shall be\nyours. As to when this had better be told, I leave you to judge.’\n\nHis words made her cheerful enough to toy with her position.\n\n‘And if ill report should come, Stephen,’ she said smiling, ‘why, the\norange-tree must save me, as it saved virgins in St. George’s time from\nthe poisonous breath of the dragon. There, forgive me for forwardness: I\nam going.’\n\nThen the boy and girl beguiled themselves with words of half-parting\nonly.\n\n‘Own wifie, God bless you till we meet again!’\n\n‘Till we meet again, good-bye!’\n\nAnd the pony went on, and she spoke to him no more. He saw her figure\ndiminish and her blue veil grow gray--saw it with the agonizing\nsensations of a slow death.\n\nAfter thus parting from a man than whom she had known none greater as\nyet, Elfride rode rapidly onwards, a tear being occasionally shaken\nfrom her eyes into the road. What yesterday had seemed so desirable, so\npromising, even trifling, had now acquired the complexion of a tragedy.\n\nShe saw the rocks and sea in the neighbourhood of Endelstow, and heaved\na sigh of relief.\n\nWhen she passed a field behind the vicarage she heard the voices of\nUnity and William Worm. They were hanging a carpet upon a line. Unity\nwas uttering a sentence that concluded with ‘when Miss Elfride comes.’\n\n‘When d’ye expect her?’\n\n‘Not till evening now. She’s safe enough at Miss Bicknell’s, bless ye.’\n\nElfride went round to the door. She did not knock or ring; and seeing\nnobody to take the horse, Elfride led her round to the yard, slipped off\nthe bridle and saddle, drove her towards the paddock, and turned her in.\nThen Elfride crept indoors, and looked into all the ground-floor rooms.\nHer father was not there.\n\nOn the mantelpiece of the drawing-room stood a letter addressed to her\nin his handwriting. She took it and read it as she went upstairs to\nchange her habit.\n\n\nSTRATLEIGH, Thursday.\n\n‘DEAR ELFRIDE,--On second thoughts I will not return to-day, but only\ncome as far as Wadcombe. I shall be at home by to-morrow afternoon, and\nbring a friend with me.--Yours, in haste,\n\nC. S.’\n\n\nAfter making a quick toilet she felt more revived, though still\nsuffering from a headache. On going out of the door she met Unity at the\ntop of the stair.\n\n‘O Miss Elfride! I said to myself ‘tis her sperrit! We didn’t dream o’\nyou not coming home last night. You didn’t say anything about staying.’\n\n‘I intended to come home the same evening, but altered my plan. I wished\nI hadn’t afterwards. Papa will be angry, I suppose?’\n\n‘Better not tell him, miss,’ said Unity.\n\n‘I do fear to,’ she murmured. ‘Unity, would you just begin telling him\nwhen he comes home?’\n\n‘What! and get you into trouble?’\n\n‘I deserve it.’\n\n‘No, indeed, I won’t,’ said Unity. ‘It is not such a mighty matter, Miss\nElfride. I says to myself, master’s taking a hollerday, and because he’s\nnot been kind lately to Miss Elfride, she----’\n\n‘Is imitating him. Well, do as you like. And will you now bring me some\nluncheon?’\n\nAfter satisfying an appetite which the fresh marine air had given her\nin its victory over an agitated mind, she put on her hat and went to\nthe garden and summer-house. She sat down, and leant with her head in a\ncorner. Here she fell asleep.\n\nHalf-awake, she hurriedly looked at the time. She had been there three\nhours. At the same moment she heard the outer gate swing together, and\nwheels sweep round the entrance; some prior noise from the same source\nhaving probably been the cause of her awaking. Next her father’s voice\nwas heard calling to Worm.\n\nElfride passed along a walk towards the house behind a belt of shrubs.\nShe heard a tongue holding converse with her father, which was not that\nof either of the servants. Her father and the stranger were laughing\ntogether. Then there was a rustling of silk, and Mr. Swancourt and his\ncompanion, or companions, to all seeming entered the door of the\nhouse, for nothing more of them was audible. Elfride had turned back to\nmeditate on what friends these could be, when she heard footsteps, and\nher father exclaiming behind her:\n\n‘O Elfride, here you are! I hope you got on well?’\n\nElfride’s heart smote her, and she did not speak.\n\n‘Come back to the summer-house a minute,’ continued Mr. Swancourt; ‘I\nhave to tell you of that I promised to.’\n\nThey entered the summer-house, and stood leaning over the knotty\nwoodwork of the balustrade.\n\n‘Now,’ said her father radiantly, ‘guess what I have to say.’ He seemed\nto be regarding his own existence so intently, that he took no interest\nin nor even saw the complexion of hers.\n\n‘I cannot, papa,’ she said sadly.\n\n‘Try, dear.’\n\n‘I would rather not, indeed.’\n\n‘You are tired. You look worn. The ride was too much for you. Well, this\nis what I went away for. I went to be married!’\n\n‘Married!’ she faltered, and could hardly check an involuntary ‘So did\nI.’ A moment after and her resolve to confess perished like a bubble.\n\n‘Yes; to whom do you think? Mrs. Troyton, the new owner of the estate\nover the hedge, and of the old manor-house. It was only finally settled\nbetween us when I went to Stratleigh a few days ago.’ He lowered his\nvoice to a sly tone of merriment. ‘Now, as to your stepmother, you’ll\nfind she is not much to look at, though a good deal to listen to. She is\ntwenty years older than myself, for one thing.’\n\n‘You forget that I know her. She called here once, after we had been,\nand found her away from home.’\n\n‘Of course, of course. Well, whatever her looks are, she’s as excellent\na woman as ever breathed. She has had lately left her as absolute\nproperty three thousand five hundred a year, besides the devise of this\nestate--and, by the way, a large legacy came to her in satisfaction of\ndower, as it is called.’\n\n‘Three thousand five hundred a year!’\n\n‘And a large--well, a fair-sized--mansion in town, and a pedigree as\nlong as my walking-stick; though that bears evidence of being rather a\nraked-up affair--done since the family got rich--people do those\nthings now as they build ruins on maiden estates and cast antiques at\nBirmingham.’\n\nElfride merely listened and said nothing.\n\nHe continued more quietly and impressively. ‘Yes, Elfride, she is\nwealthy in comparison with us, though with few connections. However, she\nwill introduce you to the world a little. We are going to exchange her\nhouse in Baker Street for one at Kensington, for your sake. Everybody is\ngoing there now, she says. At Easters we shall fly to town for the usual\nthree months--I shall have a curate of course by that time. Elfride, I\nam past love, you know, and I honestly confess that I married her for\nyour sake. Why a woman of her standing should have thrown herself\naway upon me, God knows. But I suppose her age and plainness were too\npronounced for a town man. With your good looks, if you now play your\ncards well, you may marry anybody. Of course, a little contrivance will\nbe necessary; but there’s nothing to stand between you and a husband\nwith a title, that I can see. Lady Luxellian was only a squire’s\ndaughter. Now, don’t you see how foolish the old fancy was? But come,\nshe is indoors waiting to see you. It is as good as a play, too,’\ncontinued the vicar, as they walked towards the house. ‘I courted her\nthrough the privet hedge yonder: not entirely, you know, but we used to\nwalk there of an evening--nearly every evening at last. But I needn’t\ntell you details now; everything was terribly matter-of-fact, I assure\nyou. At last, that day I saw her at Stratleigh, we determined to settle\nit off-hand.’\n\n‘And you never said a word to me,’ replied Elfride, not reproachfully\neither in tone or thought. Indeed, her feeling was the very reverse of\nreproachful. She felt relieved and even thankful. Where confidence had\nnot been given, how could confidence be expected?\n\nHer father mistook her dispassionateness for a veil of politeness over a\nsense of ill-usage. ‘I am not altogether to blame,’ he said. ‘There\nwere two or three reasons for secrecy. One was the recent death of her\nrelative the testator, though that did not apply to you. But remember,\nElfride,’ he continued in a stiffer tone, ‘you had mixed yourself up so\nfoolishly with those low people, the Smiths--and it was just, too, when\nMrs. Troyton and myself were beginning to understand each other--that I\nresolved to say nothing even to you. How did I know how far you had gone\nwith them and their son? You might have made a point of taking tea with\nthem every day, for all that I knew.’\n\nElfride swallowed her feelings as she best could, and languidly though\nflatly asked a question.\n\n‘Did you kiss Mrs. Troyton on the lawn about three weeks ago? That\nevening I came into the study and found you had just had candles in?’\n\nMr. Swancourt looked rather red and abashed, as middle-aged lovers are\napt to do when caught in the tricks of younger ones.\n\n‘Well, yes; I think I did,’ he stammered; ‘just to please her, you\nknow.’ And then recovering himself he laughed heartily.\n\n‘And was this what your Horatian quotation referred to?’\n\n‘It was, Elfride.’\n\nThey stepped into the drawing-room from the verandah. At that moment\nMrs. Swancourt came downstairs, and entered the same room by the door.\n\n‘Here, Charlotte, is my little Elfride,’ said Mr. Swancourt, with the\nincreased affection of tone often adopted towards relations when newly\nproduced.\n\nPoor Elfride, not knowing what to do, did nothing at all; but stood\nreceptive of all that came to her by sight, hearing, and touch.\n\nMrs. Swancourt moved forward, took her step-daughter’s hand, then kissed\nher.\n\n‘Ah, darling!’ she exclaimed good-humouredly, ‘you didn’t think when you\nshowed a strange old woman over the conservatory a month or two ago, and\nexplained the flowers to her so prettily, that she would so soon be here\nin new colours. Nor did she, I am sure.’\n\nThe new mother had been truthfully enough described by Mr. Swancourt.\nShe was not physically attractive. She was dark--very dark--in\ncomplexion, portly in figure, and with a plentiful residuum of hair in\nthe proportion of half a dozen white ones to half a dozen black ones,\nthough the latter were black indeed. No further observed, she was not a\nwoman to like. But there was more to see. To the most superficial critic\nit was apparent that she made no attempt to disguise her age. She looked\nsixty at the first glance, and close acquaintanceship never proved her\nolder.\n\nAnother and still more winning trait was one attaching to the corners\nof her mouth. Before she made a remark these often twitched gently: not\nbackwards and forwards, the index of nervousness; not down upon the jaw,\nthe sign of determination; but palpably upwards, in precisely the curve\nadopted to represent mirth in the broad caricatures of schoolboys. Only\nthis element in her face was expressive of anything within the woman,\nbut it was unmistakable. It expressed humour subjective as well as\nobjective--which could survey the peculiarities of self in as whimsical\na light as those of other people.\n\nThis is not all of Mrs. Swancourt. She had held out to Elfride hands\nwhose fingers were literally stiff with rings, signis auroque rigentes,\nlike Helen’s robe. These rows of rings were not worn in vanity\napparently. They were mostly antique and dull, though a few were the\nreverse.\n\n\nRIGHT HAND.\n\n1st. Plainly set oval onyx, representing a devil’s head. 2nd. Green\njasper intaglio, with red veins. 3rd. Entirely gold, bearing figure of\na hideous griffin. 4th. A sea-green monster diamond, with small diamonds\nround it. 5th. Antique cornelian intaglio of dancing figure of a\nsatyr. 6th. An angular band chased with dragons’ heads. 7th. A facetted\ncarbuncle accompanied by ten little twinkling emeralds; &c. &c.\n\n\nLEFT HAND.\n\n1st. A reddish-yellow toadstone. 2nd. A heavy ring enamelled in colours,\nand bearing a jacynth. 3rd. An amethystine sapphire. 4th. A polished\nruby, surrounded by diamonds. 5th. The engraved ring of an abbess. 6th.\nA gloomy intaglio; &c. &c.\n\n\nBeyond this rather quaint array of stone and metal Mrs. Swancourt wore\nno ornament whatever.\n\nElfride had been favourably impressed with Mrs. Troyton at their meeting\nabout two months earlier; but to be pleased with a woman as a momentary\nacquaintance was different from being taken with her as a stepmother.\nHowever, the suspension of feeling was but for a moment. Elfride decided\nto like her still.\n\nMrs. Swancourt was a woman of the world as to knowledge, the reverse\nas to action, as her marriage suggested. Elfride and the lady were soon\ninextricably involved in conversation, and Mr. Swancourt left them to\nthemselves.\n\n‘And what do you find to do with yourself here?’ Mrs. Swancourt said,\nafter a few remarks about the wedding. ‘You ride, I know.’\n\n‘Yes, I ride. But not much, because papa doesn’t like my going alone.’\n\n‘You must have somebody to look after you.’\n\n‘And I read, and write a little.’\n\n‘You should write a novel. The regular resource of people who don’t go\nenough into the world to live a novel is to write one.’\n\n‘I have done it,’ said Elfride, looking dubiously at Mrs. Swancourt, as\nif in doubt whether she would meet with ridicule there.\n\n‘That’s right. Now, then, what is it about, dear?’\n\n‘About--well, it is a romance of the Middle Ages.’\n\n‘Knowing nothing of the present age, which everybody knows about, for\nsafety you chose an age known neither to you nor other people. That’s\nit, eh? No, no; I don’t mean it, dear.’\n\n‘Well, I have had some opportunities of studying mediaeval art and\nmanners in the library and private museum at Endelstow House, and I\nthought I should like to try my hand upon a fiction. I know the time for\nthese tales is past; but I was interested in it, very much interested.’\n\n‘When is it to appear?’\n\n‘Oh, never, I suppose.’\n\n‘Nonsense, my dear girl. Publish it, by all means. All ladies do that\nsort of thing now; not for profit, you know, but as a guarantee of\nmental respectability to their future husbands.’\n\n‘An excellent idea of us ladies.’\n\n‘Though I am afraid it rather resembles the melancholy ruse of throwing\nloaves over castle-walls at besiegers, and suggests desperation rather\nthan plenty inside.’\n\n‘Did you ever try it?’\n\n‘No; I was too far gone even for that.’\n\n‘Papa says no publisher will take my book.’\n\n‘That remains to be proved. I’ll give my word, my dear, that by this\ntime next year it shall be printed.’\n\n‘Will you, indeed?’ said Elfride, partially brightening with pleasure,\nthough she was sad enough in her depths. ‘I thought brains were the\nindispensable, even if the only, qualification for admission to the\nrepublic of letters. A mere commonplace creature like me will soon be\nturned out again.’\n\n‘Oh no; once you are there you’ll be like a drop of water in a piece of\nrock-crystal--your medium will dignify your commonness.’\n\n‘It will be a great satisfaction,’ Elfride murmured, and thought of\nStephen, and wished she could make a great fortune by writing romances,\nand marry him and live happily.\n\n‘And then we’ll go to London, and then to Paris,’ said Mrs. Swancourt.\n‘I have been talking to your father about it. But we have first to move\ninto the manor-house, and we think of staying at Torquay whilst that\nis going on. Meanwhile, instead of going on a honeymoon scamper by\nourselves, we have come home to fetch you, and go all together to Bath\nfor two or three weeks.’\n\nElfride assented pleasantly, even gladly; but she saw that, by this\nmarriage, her father and herself had ceased for ever to be the close\nrelations they had been up to a few weeks ago. It was impossible now to\ntell him the tale of her wild elopement with Stephen Smith.\n\nHe was still snugly housed in her heart. His absence had regained for\nhim much of that aureola of saintship which had been nearly abstracted\nduring her reproachful mood on that miserable journey from London.\nRapture is often cooled by contact with its cause, especially if under\nawkward conditions. And that last experience with Stephen had done\nanything but make him shine in her eyes. His very kindness in letting\nher return was his offence. Elfride had her sex’s love of sheer force\nin a man, however ill-directed; and at that critical juncture in London\nStephen’s only chance of retaining the ascendancy over her that his face\nand not his parts had acquired for him, would have been by doing what,\nfor one thing, he was too youthful to undertake--that was, dragging her\nby the wrist to the rails of some altar, and peremptorily marrying\nher. Decisive action is seen by appreciative minds to be frequently\nobjectless, and sometimes fatal; but decision, however suicidal, has\nmore charm for a woman than the most unequivocal Fabian success.\n\nHowever, some of the unpleasant accessories of that occasion were now\nout of sight again, and Stephen had resumed not a few of his fancy\ncolours.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIII\n\n     ‘He set in order many proverbs.’\n\n\nIt is London in October--two months further on in the story.\n\nBede’s Inn has this peculiarity, that it faces, receives from, and\ndischarges into a bustling thoroughfare speaking only of wealth\nand respectability, whilst its postern abuts on as crowded and\npoverty-stricken a network of alleys as are to be found anywhere in the\nmetropolis. The moral consequences are, first, that those who occupy\nchambers in the Inn may see a great deal of shirtless humanity’s habits\nand enjoyments without doing more than look down from a back window;\nand second they may hear wholesome though unpleasant social reminders\nthrough the medium of a harsh voice, an unequal footstep, the echo of\na blow or a fall, which originates in the person of some drunkard or\nwife-beater, as he crosses and interferes with the quiet of the square.\nCharacters of this kind frequently pass through the Inn from a little\nfoxhole of an alley at the back, but they never loiter there.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to state that all the sights and movements proper\nto the Inn are most orderly. On the fine October evening on which we\nfollow Stephen Smith to this place, a placid porter is sitting on a\nstool under a sycamore-tree in the midst, with a little cane in his\nhand. We notice the thick coat of soot upon the branches, hanging\nunderneath them in flakes, as in a chimney. The blackness of these\nboughs does not at present improve the tree--nearly forsaken by its\nleaves as it is--but in the spring their green fresh beauty is made\ndoubly beautiful by the contrast. Within the railings is a flower-garden\nof respectable dahlias and chrysanthemums, where a man is sweeping the\nleaves from the grass.\n\nStephen selects a doorway, and ascends an old though wide wooden\nstaircase, with moulded balusters and handrail, which in a country\nmanor-house would be considered a noteworthy specimen of Renaissance\nworkmanship. He reaches a door on the first floor, over which is\npainted, in black letters, ‘Mr. Henry Knight’--‘Barrister-at-law’ being\nunderstood but not expressed. The wall is thick, and there is a door at\nits outer and inner face. The outer one happens to be ajar: Stephen goes\nto the other, and taps.\n\n‘Come in!’ from distant penetralia.\n\nFirst was a small anteroom, divided from the inner apartment by a\nwainscoted archway two or three yards wide. Across this archway hung\na pair of dark-green curtains, making a mystery of all within the arch\nexcept the spasmodic scratching of a quill pen. Here was grouped\na chaotic assemblage of articles--mainly old framed prints and\npaintings--leaning edgewise against the wall, like roofing slates in\na builder’s yard. All the books visible here were folios too big to be\nstolen--some lying on a heavy oak table in one corner, some on the\nfloor among the pictures, the whole intermingled with old coats, hats,\numbrellas, and walking-sticks.\n\nStephen pushed aside the curtain, and before him sat a man writing away\nas if his life depended upon it--which it did.\n\nA man of thirty in a speckled coat, with dark brown hair, curly beard,\nand crisp moustache: the latter running into the beard on each side of\nthe mouth, and, as usual, hiding the real expression of that organ under\na chronic aspect of impassivity.\n\n‘Ah, my dear fellow, I knew ‘twas you,’ said Knight, looking up with a\nsmile, and holding out his hand.\n\nKnight’s mouth and eyes came to view now. Both features were good, and\nhad the peculiarity of appearing younger and fresher than the brow\nand face they belonged to, which were getting sicklied o’er by the\nunmistakable pale cast. The mouth had not quite relinquished rotundity\nof curve for the firm angularities of middle life; and the eyes, though\nkeen, permeated rather than penetrated: what they had lost of their\nboy-time brightness by a dozen years of hard reading lending a quietness\nto their gaze which suited them well.\n\nA lady would have said there was a smell of tobacco in the room: a man\nthat there was not.\n\nKnight did not rise. He looked at a timepiece on the mantelshelf, then\nturned again to his letters, pointing to a chair.\n\n‘Well, I am glad you have come. I only returned to town yesterday; now,\ndon’t speak, Stephen, for ten minutes; I have just that time to the late\npost. At the eleventh minute, I’m your man.’\n\nStephen sat down as if this kind of reception was by no means new, and\naway went Knight’s pen, beating up and down like a ship in a storm.\n\nCicero called the library the soul of the house; here the house was all\nsoul. Portions of the floor, and half the wall-space, were taken up by\nbook-shelves ordinary and extraordinary; the remaining parts, together\nwith brackets, side-tables, &c., being occupied by casts, statuettes,\nmedallions, and plaques of various descriptions, picked up by the owner\nin his wanderings through France and Italy.\n\nOne stream only of evening sunlight came into the room from a window\nquite in the corner, overlooking a court. An aquarium stood in the\nwindow. It was a dull parallelopipedon enough for living creatures at\nmost hours of the day; but for a few minutes in the evening, as now, an\nerrant, kindly ray lighted up and warmed the little world therein, when\nthe many-coloured zoophytes opened and put forth their arms, the weeds\nacquired a rich transparency, the shells gleamed of a more golden\nyellow, and the timid community expressed gladness more plainly than in\nwords.\n\nWithin the prescribed ten minutes Knight flung down his pen, rang for\nthe boy to take the letters to the post, and at the closing of the door\nexclaimed, ‘There; thank God, that’s done. Now, Stephen, pull your chair\nround, and tell me what you have been doing all this time. Have you kept\nup your Greek?’\n\n‘No.’\n\n‘How’s that?’\n\n‘I haven’t enough spare time.’\n\n‘That’s nonsense.’\n\n‘Well, I have done a great many things, if not that. And I have done one\nextraordinary thing.’\n\nKnight turned full upon Stephen. ‘Ah-ha! Now, then, let me look into\nyour face, put two and two together, and make a shrewd guess.’\n\nStephen changed to a redder colour.\n\n‘Why, Smith,’ said Knight, after holding him rigidly by the shoulders,\nand keenly scrutinising his countenance for a minute in silence, ‘you\nhave fallen in love.’\n\n‘Well--the fact is----’\n\n‘Now, out with it.’ But seeing that Stephen looked rather distressed, he\nchanged to a kindly tone. ‘Now Smith, my lad, you know me well enough by\nthis time, or you ought to; and you know very well that if you choose to\ngive me a detailed account of the phenomenon within you, I shall listen;\nif you don’t, I am the last man in the world to care to hear it.’\n\n‘I’ll tell this much: I HAVE fallen in love, and I want to be MARRIED.’\n\nKnight looked ominous as this passed Stephen’s lips.\n\n‘Don’t judge me before you have heard more,’ cried Stephen anxiously,\nseeing the change in his friend’s countenance.\n\n‘I don’t judge. Does your mother know about it?’\n\n‘Nothing definite.’\n\n‘Father?’\n\n‘No. But I’ll tell you. The young person----’\n\n‘Come, that’s dreadfully ungallant. But perhaps I understand the frame\nof mind a little, so go on. Your sweetheart----’\n\n‘She is rather higher in the world than I am.’\n\n‘As it should be.’\n\n‘And her father won’t hear of it, as I now stand.’\n\n‘Not an uncommon case.’\n\n‘And now comes what I want your advice upon. Something has happened at\nher house which makes it out of the question for us to ask her father\nagain now. So we are keeping silent. In the meantime an architect in\nIndia has just written to Mr. Hewby to ask whether he can find for him\na young assistant willing to go over to Bombay to prepare drawings for\nwork formerly done by the engineers. The salary he offers is 350 rupees\na month, or about 35 Pounds. Hewby has mentioned it to me, and I have\nbeen to Dr. Wray, who says I shall acclimatise without much illness.\nNow, would you go?’\n\n‘You mean to say, because it is a possible road to the young lady.’\n\n‘Yes; I was thinking I could go over and make a little money, and then\ncome back and ask for her. I have the option of practising for myself\nafter a year.’\n\n‘Would she be staunch?’\n\n‘Oh yes! For ever--to the end of her life!’\n\n‘How do you know?’\n\n‘Why, how do people know? Of course, she will.’\n\nKnight leant back in his chair. ‘Now, though I know her thoroughly as\nshe exists in your heart, Stephen, I don’t know her in the flesh. All\nI want to ask is, is this idea of going to India based entirely upon a\nbelief in her fidelity?’\n\n‘Yes; I should not go if it were not for her.’\n\n‘Well, Stephen, you have put me in rather an awkward position. If I give\nmy true sentiments, I shall hurt your feelings; if I don’t, I shall hurt\nmy own judgment. And remember, I don’t know much about women.’\n\n‘But you have had attachments, although you tell me very little about\nthem.’\n\n‘And I only hope you’ll continue to prosper till I tell you more.’\n\nStephen winced at this rap. ‘I have never formed a deep attachment,’\ncontinued Knight. ‘I never have found a woman worth it. Nor have I been\nonce engaged to be married.’\n\n‘You write as if you had been engaged a hundred times, if I may be\nallowed to say so,’ said Stephen in an injured tone.\n\n‘Yes, that may be. But, my dear Stephen, it is only those who half know\na thing that write about it. Those who know it thoroughly don’t take\nthe trouble. All I know about women, or men either, is a mass of\ngeneralities. I plod along, and occasionally lift my eyes and skim the\nweltering surface of mankind lying between me and the horizon, as a crow\nmight; no more.’\n\nKnight stopped as if he had fallen into a train of thought, and Stephen\nlooked with affectionate awe at a master whose mind, he believed, could\nswallow up at one meal all that his own head contained.\n\nThere was affective sympathy, but no great intellectual fellowship,\nbetween Knight and Stephen Smith. Knight had seen his young friend when\nthe latter was a cherry-cheeked happy boy, had been interested in him,\nhad kept his eye upon him, and generously helped the lad to books, till\nthe mere connection of patronage grew to acquaintance, and that ripened\nto friendship. And so, though Smith was not at all the man Knight would\nhave deliberately chosen as a friend--or even for one of a group of a\ndozen friends--he somehow was his friend. Circumstance, as usual, did\nit all. How many of us can say of our most intimate alter ego, leaving\nalone friends of the outer circle, that he is the man we should have\nchosen, as embodying the net result after adding up all the points in\nhuman nature that we love, and principles we hold, and subtracting all\nthat we hate? The man is really somebody we got to know by mere physical\njuxtaposition long maintained, and was taken into our confidence, and\neven heart, as a makeshift.\n\n‘And what do you think of her?’ Stephen ventured to say, after a\nsilence.\n\n‘Taking her merits on trust from you,’ said Knight, ‘as we do those of\nthe Roman poets of whom we know nothing but that they lived, I still\nthink she will not stick to you through, say, three years of absence in\nIndia.’\n\n‘But she will!’ cried Stephen desperately. ‘She is a girl all delicacy\nand honour. And no woman of that kind, who has committed herself so into\na man’s hands as she has into mine, could possibly marry another.’\n\n‘How has she committed herself?’ asked Knight cunously.\n\nStephen did not answer. Knight had looked on his love so sceptically\nthat it would not do to say all that he had intended to say by any\nmeans.\n\n‘Well, don’t tell,’ said Knight. ‘But you are begging the question,\nwhich is, I suppose, inevitable in love.’\n\n‘And I’ll tell you another thing,’ the younger man pleaded. ‘You\nremember what you said to me once about women receiving a kiss. Don’t\nyou? Why, that instead of our being charmed by the fascination of\ntheir bearing at such a time, we should immediately doubt them if their\nconfusion has any GRACE in it--that awkward bungling was the true charm\nof the occasion, implying that we are the first who has played such a\npart with them.’\n\n‘It is true, quite,’ said Knight musingly.\n\nIt often happened that the disciple thus remembered the lessons of the\nmaster long after the master himself had forgotten them.\n\n‘Well, that was like her!’ cried Stephen triumphantly. ‘She was in such\na flurry that she didn’t know what she was doing.’\n\n‘Splendid, splendid!’ said Knight soothingly. ‘So that all I have to say\nis, that if you see a good opening in Bombay there’s no reason why you\nshould not go without troubling to draw fine distinctions as to reasons.\nNo man fully realizes what opinions he acts upon, or what his actions\nmean.’\n\n‘Yes; I go to Bombay. I’ll write a note here, if you don’t mind.’\n\n‘Sleep over it--it is the best plan--and write to-morrow. Meantime, go\nthere to that window and sit down, and look at my Humanity Show. I\nam going to dine out this evening, and have to dress here out of my\nportmanteau. I bring up my things like this to save the trouble of going\ndown to my place at Richmond and back again.’\n\nKnight then went to the middle of the room and flung open his\nportmanteau, and Stephen drew near the window. The streak of sunlight\nhad crept upward, edged away, and vanished; the zoophytes slept: a dusky\ngloom pervaded the room. And now another volume of light shone over the\nwindow.\n\n‘There!’ said Knight, ‘where is there in England a spectacle to equal\nthat? I sit there and watch them every night before I go home. Softly\nopen the sash.’\n\nBeneath them was an alley running up to the wall, and thence turning\nsideways and passing under an arch, so that Knight’s back window\nwas immediately over the angle, and commanded a view of the alley\nlengthwise. Crowds--mostly of women--were surging, bustling, and pacing\nup and down. Gaslights glared from butchers’ stalls, illuminating the\nlumps of flesh to splotches of orange and vermilion, like the wild\ncolouring of Turner’s later pictures, whilst the purl and babble of\ntongues of every pitch and mood was to this human wild-wood what the\nripple of a brook is to the natural forest.\n\nNearly ten minutes passed. Then Knight also came to the window.\n\n‘Well, now, I call a cab and vanish down the street in the direction\nof Berkeley Square,’ he said, buttoning his waistcoat and kicking his\nmorning suit into a corner. Stephen rose to leave.\n\n‘What a heap of literature!’ remarked the young man, taking a final\nlonging survey round the room, as if to abide there for ever would be\nthe great pleasure of his life, yet feeling that he had almost outstayed\nhis welcome-while. His eyes rested upon an arm-chair piled full of\nnewspapers, magazines, and bright new volumes in green and red.\n\n‘Yes,’ said Knight, also looking at them and breathing a sigh of\nweariness; ‘something must be done with several of them soon, I suppose.\nStephen, you needn’t hurry away for a few minutes, you know, if you want\nto stay; I am not quite ready. Overhaul those volumes whilst I put on my\ncoat, and I’ll walk a little way with you.’\n\nStephen sat down beside the arm-chair and began to tumble the books\nabout. Among the rest he found a novelette in one volume, THE COURT OF\nKELLYON CASTLE. By Ernest Field.\n\n‘Are you going to review this?’ inquired Stephen with apparent\nunconcern, and holding up Elfride’s effusion.\n\n‘Which? Oh, that! I may--though I don’t do much light reviewing now. But\nit is reviewable.’\n\n‘How do you mean?’\n\nKnight never liked to be asked what he meant. ‘Mean! I mean that the\nmajority of books published are neither good enough nor bad enough to\nprovoke criticism, and that that book does provoke it.’\n\n‘By its goodness or its badness?’ Stephen said with some anxiety on poor\nlittle Elfride’s score.\n\n‘Its badness. It seems to be written by some girl in her teens.’\n\nStephen said not another word. He did not care to speak plainly of\nElfride after that unfortunate slip his tongue had made in respect\nof her having committed herself; and, apart from that, Knight’s\nsevere--almost dogged and self-willed--honesty in criticizing was\nunassailable by the humble wish of a youthful friend like Stephen.\n\nKnight was now ready. Turning off the gas, and slamming together the\ndoor, they went downstairs and into the street.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIV\n\n     ‘We frolic while ‘tis May.’\n\n\nIt has now to be realized that nearly three-quarters of a year have\npassed away. In place of the autumnal scenery which formed a setting to\nthe previous enactments, we have the culminating blooms of summer in the\nyear following.\n\nStephen is in India, slaving away at an office in Bombay; occasionally\ngoing up the country on professional errands, and wondering why people\nwho had been there longer than he complained so much of the effect of\nthe climate upon their constitutions. Never had a young man a finer\nstart than seemed now to present itself to Stephen. It was just in that\nexceptional heyday of prosperity which shone over Bombay some few years\nago, that he arrived on the scene. Building and engineering partook\nof the general impetus. Speculation moved with an accelerated velocity\nevery successive day, the only disagreeable contingency connected with\nit being the possibility of a collapse.\n\nElfride had never told her father of the four-and-twenty-hours’ escapade\nwith Stephen, nor had it, to her knowledge, come to his ears by any\nother route. It was a secret trouble and grief to the girl for a short\ntime, and Stephen’s departure was another ingredient in her sorrow. But\nElfride possessed special facilities for getting rid of trouble after a\ndecent interval. Whilst a slow nature was imbibing a misfortune little\nby little, she had swallowed the whole agony of it at a draught and was\nbrightening again. She could slough off a sadness and replace it by a\nhope as easily as a lizard renews a diseased limb.\n\nAnd two such excellent distractions had presented themselves. One was\nbringing out the romance and looking for notices in the papers, which,\nthough they had been significantly short so far, had served to divert\nher thoughts. The other was migrating from the vicarage to the more\ncommodious old house of Mrs. Swancourt’s, overlooking the same valley.\nMr. Swancourt at first disliked the idea of being transplanted to\nfeminine soil, but the obvious advantages of such an accession of\ndignity reconciled him to the change. So there was a radical ‘move;’ the\ntwo ladies staying at Torquay as had been arranged, the vicar going to\nand fro.\n\nMrs. Swancourt considerably enlarged Elfride’s ideas in an aristocratic\ndirection, and she began to forgive her father for his politic marriage.\nCertainly, in a worldly sense, a handsome face at three-and-forty had\nnever served a man in better stead.\n\n\nThe new house at Kensington was ready, and they were all in town.\n\nThe Hyde Park shrubs had been transplanted as usual, the chairs ranked\nin line, the grass edgings trimmed, the roads made to look as if they\nwere suffering from a heavy thunderstorm; carriages had been called for\nby the easeful, horses by the brisk, and the Drive and Row were again\nthe groove of gaiety for an hour. We gaze upon the spectacle, at six\no’clock on this midsummer afternoon, in a melon-frame atmosphere and\nbeneath a violet sky. The Swancourt equipage formed one in the stream.\n\nMrs. Swancourt was a talker of talk of the incisive kind, which her low\nmusical voice--the only beautiful point in the old woman--prevented from\nbeing wearisome.\n\n‘Now,’ she said to Elfride, who, like AEneas at Carthage, was full\nof admiration for the brilliant scene, ‘you will find that our\ncompanionless state will give us, as it does everybody, an extraordinary\npower in reading the features of our fellow-creatures here. I always\nam a listener in such places as these--not to the narratives told by my\nneighbours’ tongues, but by their faces--the advantage of which is, that\nwhether I am in Row, Boulevard, Rialto, or Prado, they all speak the\nsame language. I may have acquired some skill in this practice through\nhaving been an ugly lonely woman for so many years, with nobody to give\nme information; a thing you will not consider strange when the parallel\ncase is borne in mind,--how truly people who have no clocks will tell\nthe time of day.’\n\n‘Ay, that they will,’ said Mr. Swancourt corroboratively. ‘I have known\nlabouring men at Endelstow and other farms who had framed complete\nsystems of observation for that purpose. By means of shadows, winds,\nclouds, the movements of sheep and oxen, the singing of birds, the\ncrowing of cocks, and a hundred other sights and sounds which people\nwith watches in their pockets never know the existence of, they are\nable to pronounce within ten minutes of the hour almost at any required\ninstant. That reminds me of an old story which I’m afraid is too\nbad--too bad to repeat.’ Here the vicar shook his head and laughed\ninwardly.\n\n‘Tell it--do!’ said the ladies.\n\n‘I mustn’t quite tell it.’\n\n‘That’s absurd,’ said Mrs. Swancourt.\n\n‘It was only about a man who, by the same careful system of observation,\nwas known to deceive persons for more than two years into the belief\nthat he kept a barometer by stealth, so exactly did he foretell all\nchanges in the weather by the braying of his ass and the temper of his\nwife.’\n\nElfride laughed.\n\n‘Exactly,’ said Mrs. Swancourt. ‘And in just the way that those learnt\nthe signs of nature, I have learnt the language of her illegitimate\nsister--artificiality; and the fibbing of eyes, the contempt of\nnose-tips, the indignation of back hair, the laughter of clothes, the\ncynicism of footsteps, and the various emotions lying in walking-stick\ntwirls, hat-liftings, the elevation of parasols, the carriage of\numbrellas, become as A B C to me.\n\n‘Just look at that daughter’s sister class of mamma in the carriage\nacross there,’ she continued to Elfride, pointing with merely a turn of\nher eye. ‘The absorbing self-consciousness of her position that is shown\nby her countenance is most humiliating to a lover of one’s country. You\nwould hardly believe, would you, that members of a Fashionable World,\nwhose professed zero is far above the highest degree of the humble,\ncould be so ignorant of the elementary instincts of reticence.’\n\n‘How?’\n\n‘Why, to bear on their faces, as plainly as on a phylactery, the\ninscription, “Do, pray, look at the coronet on my panels.”’\n\n‘Really, Charlotte,’ said the vicar, ‘you see as much in faces as Mr.\nPuff saw in Lord Burleigh’s nod.’\n\nElfride could not but admire the beauty of her fellow countrywomen,\nespecially since herself and her own few acquaintances had always\nbeen slightly sunburnt or marked on the back of the hands by a\nbramble-scratch at this time of the year.\n\n‘And what lovely flowers and leaves they wear in their bonnets!’ she\nexclaimed.\n\n‘Oh yes,’ returned Mrs. Swancourt. ‘Some of them are even more striking\nin colour than any real ones. Look at that beautiful rose worn by the\nlady inside the rails. Elegant vine-tendrils introduced upon the stem as\nan improvement upon prickles, and all growing so naturally just over her\near--I say growing advisedly, for the pink of the petals and the pink\nof her handsome cheeks are equally from Nature’s hand to the eyes of the\nmost casual observer.’\n\n‘But praise them a little, they do deserve it!’ said generous Elfride.\n\n‘Well, I do. See how the Duchess of----waves to and fro in her seat,\nutilizing the sway of her landau by looking around only when her head\nis swung forward, with a passive pride which forbids a resistance to\nthe force of circumstance. Look at the pretty pout on the mouths of that\nfamily there, retaining no traces of being arranged beforehand, so well\nis it done. Look at the demure close of the little fists holding the\nparasols; the tiny alert thumb, sticking up erect against the ivory stem\nas knowing as can be, the satin of the parasol invariably matching the\ncomplexion of the face beneath it, yet seemingly by an accident,\nwhich makes the thing so attractive. There’s the red book lying on the\nopposite seat, bespeaking the vast numbers of their acquaintance. And\nI particularly admire the aspect of that abundantly daughtered woman on\nthe other side--I mean her look of unconsciousness that the girls\nare stared at by the walkers, and above all the look of the girls\nthemselves--losing their gaze in the depths of handsome men’s eyes\nwithout appearing to notice whether they are observing masculine eyes or\nthe leaves of the trees. There’s praise for you. But I am only jesting,\nchild--you know that.’\n\n‘Piph-ph-ph--how warm it is, to be sure!’ said Mr. Swancourt, as if his\nmind were a long distance from all he saw. ‘I declare that my watch is\nso hot that I can scarcely bear to touch it to see what the time is, and\nall the world smells like the inside of a hat.’\n\n‘How the men stare at you, Elfride!’ said the elder lady. ‘You will kill\nme quite, I am afraid.’\n\n‘Kill you?’\n\n‘As a diamond kills an opal in the same setting.’\n\n‘I have noticed several ladies and gentlemen looking at me,’ said\nElfride artlessly, showing her pleasure at being observed.\n\n‘My dear, you mustn’t say “gentlemen” nowadays,’ her stepmother answered\nin the tones of arch concern that so well became her ugliness. ‘We have\nhanded over “gentlemen” to the lower middle class, where the word is\nstill to be heard at tradesmen’s balls and provincial tea-parties, I\nbelieve. It is done with here.’\n\n‘What must I say, then?’\n\n‘“Ladies and MEN” always.’\n\nAt this moment appeared in the stream of vehicles moving in the contrary\ndirection a chariot presenting in its general surface the rich indigo\nhue of a midnight sky, the wheels and margins being picked out in\ndelicate lines of ultramarine; the servants’ liveries were dark-blue\ncoats and silver lace, and breeches of neutral Indian red. The whole\nconcern formed an organic whole, and moved along behind a pair of dark\nchestnut geldings, who advanced in an indifferently zealous trot, very\ndaintily performed, and occasionally shrugged divers points of their\nveiny surface as if they were rather above the business.\n\nIn this sat a gentleman with no decided characteristics more than\nthat he somewhat resembled a good-natured commercial traveller of\nthe superior class. Beside him was a lady with skim-milky eyes and\ncomplexion, belonging to the “interesting” class of women, where that\nclass merges in the sickly, her greatest pleasure being apparently to\nenjoy nothing. Opposite this pair sat two little girls in white hats and\nblue feathers.\n\nThe lady saw Elfride, smiled and bowed, and touched her husband’s elbow,\nwho turned and received Elfride’s movement of recognition with a gallant\nelevation of his hat. Then the two children held up their arms to\nElfride, and laughed gleefully.\n\n‘Who is that?’\n\n‘Why, Lord Luxellian, isn’t it?’ said Mrs. Swancourt, who with the vicar\nhad been seated with her back towards them.\n\n‘Yes,’ replied Elfride. ‘He is the one man of those I have seen here\nwhom I consider handsomer than papa.’\n\n‘Thank you, dear,’ said Mr. Swancourt.\n\n‘Yes; but your father is so much older. When Lord Luxellian gets a\nlittle further on in life, he won’t be half so good-looking as our man.’\n\n‘Thank you, dear, likewise,’ said Mr. Swancourt.\n\n‘See,’ exclaimed Elfride, still looking towards them, ‘how those little\ndears want me! Actually one of them is crying for me to come.’\n\n‘We were talking of bracelets just now. Look at Lady Luxellian’s,’ said\nMrs. Swancourt, as that baroness lifted up her arm to support one of the\nchildren. ‘It is slipping up her arm--too large by half. I hate to see\ndaylight between a bracelet and a wrist; I wonder women haven’t better\ntaste.’\n\n‘It is not on that account, indeed,’ Elfride expostulated. ‘It is that\nher arm has got thin, poor thing. You cannot think how much she has\naltered in this last twelvemonth.’\n\nThe carriages were now nearer together, and there was an exchange of\nmore familiar greetings between the two families. Then the Luxellians\ncrossed over and drew up under the plane-trees, just in the rear of the\nSwancourts. Lord Luxellian alighted, and came forward with a musical\nlaugh.\n\nIt was his attraction as a man. People liked him for those tones, and\nforgot that he had no talents. Acquaintances remembered Mr. Swancourt by\nhis manner; they remembered Stephen Smith by his face, Lord Luxellian by\nhis laugh.\n\nMr. Swancourt made some friendly remarks--among others things upon the\nheat.\n\n‘Yes,’ said Lord Luxellian, ‘we were driving by a furrier’s window this\nafternoon, and the sight filled us all with such a sense of suffocation\nthat we were glad to get away. Ha-ha!’ He turned to Elfride. ‘Miss\nSwancourt, I have hardly seen or spoken to you since your literary feat\nwas made public. I had no idea a chiel was taking notes down at quiet\nEndelstow, or I should certainly have put myself and friends upon our\nbest behaviour. Swancourt, why didn’t you give me a hint!’\n\nElfride fluttered, blushed, laughed, said it was nothing to speak of,\n&c. &c.\n\n‘Well, I think you were rather unfairly treated by the PRESENT, I\ncertainly do. Writing a heavy review like that upon an elegant trifle\nlike the COURT OF KELLYON CASTLE was absurd.’\n\n‘What?’ said Elfride, opening her eyes. ‘Was I reviewed in the PRESENT?’\n\n‘Oh yes; didn’t you see it? Why, it was four or five months ago!’\n\n‘No, I never saw it. How sorry I am! What a shame of my publishers! They\npromised to send me every notice that appeared.’\n\n‘Ah, then, I am almost afraid I have been giving you disagreeable\ninformation, intentionally withheld out of courtesy. Depend upon it\nthey thought no good would come of sending it, and so would not pain you\nunnecessarily.’\n\n‘Oh no; I am indeed glad you have told me, Lord Luxellian. It is quite a\nmistaken kindness on their part. Is the review so much against me?’ she\ninquired tremulously.\n\n‘No, no; not that exactly--though I almost forget its exact purport\nnow. It was merely--merely sharp, you know--ungenerous, I might say. But\nreally my memory does not enable me to speak decidedly.’\n\n‘We’ll drive to the PRESENT office, and get one directly; shall we,\npapa?’\n\n‘If you are so anxious, dear, we will, or send. But to-morrow will do.’\n\n‘And do oblige me in a little matter now, Elfride,’ said Lord Luxellian\nwarmly, and looking as if he were sorry he had brought news that\ndisturbed her. ‘I am in reality sent here as a special messenger by my\nlittle Polly and Katie to ask you to come into our carriage with them\nfor a short time. I am just going to walk across into Piccadilly, and\nmy wife is left alone with them. I am afraid they are rather spoilt\nchildren; but I have half promised them you shall come.’\n\nThe steps were let down, and Elfride was transferred--to the intense\ndelight of the little girls, and to the mild interest of loungers with\nred skins and long necks, who cursorily eyed the performance with their\nwalking-sticks to their lips, occasionally laughing from far down their\nthroats and with their eyes, their mouths not being concerned in the\noperation at all. Lord Luxellian then told the coachman to drive on,\nlifted his hat, smiled a smile that missed its mark and alighted on a\ntotal stranger, who bowed in bewilderment. Lord Luxellian looked long at\nElfride.\n\nThe look was a manly, open, and genuine look of admiration; a momentary\ntribute of a kind which any honest Englishman might have paid to\nfairness without being ashamed of the feeling, or permitting it to\nencroach in the slightest degree upon his emotional obligations as\na husband and head of a family. Then Lord Luxellian turned away, and\nwalked musingly to the upper end of the promenade.\n\nMr. Swancourt had alighted at the same time with Elfride, crossing over\nto the Row for a few minutes to speak to a friend he recognized there;\nand his wife was thus left sole tenant of the carriage.\n\nNow, whilst this little act had been in course of performance, there\nstood among the promenading spectators a man of somewhat different\ndescription from the rest. Behind the general throng, in the rear of the\nchairs, and leaning against the trunk of a tree, he looked at Elfride\nwith quiet and critical interest.\n\nThree points about this unobtrusive person showed promptly to\nthe exercised eye that he was not a Row man pur sang. First, an\nirrepressible wrinkle or two in the waist of his frock-coat--denoting\nthat he had not damned his tailor sufficiently to drive that tradesman\nup to the orthodox high pressure of cunning workmanship. Second, a\nslight slovenliness of umbrella, occasioned by its owner’s habit of\nresting heavily upon it, and using it as a veritable walking-stick,\ninstead of letting its point touch the ground in the most coquettish of\nkisses, as is the proper Row manner to do. Third, and chief reason, that\ntry how you might, you could scarcely help supposing, on looking at his\nface, that your eyes were not far from a well-finished mind, instead of\nthe well-finished skin et praeterea nihil, which is by rights the Mark\nof the Row.\n\nThe probability is that, had not Mrs. Swancourt been left alone in her\ncarriage under the tree, this man would have remained in his unobserved\nseclusion. But seeing her thus, he came round to the front, stooped\nunder the rail, and stood beside the carriage-door.\n\nMrs. Swancourt looked reflectively at him for a quarter of a minute,\nthen held out her hand laughingly:\n\n‘Why, Henry Knight--of course it is! My--second--third--fourth\ncousin--what shall I say? At any rate, my kinsman.’\n\n‘Yes, one of a remnant not yet cut off. I scarcely was certain of you,\neither, from where I was standing.’\n\n‘I have not seen you since you first went to Oxford; consider the number\nof years! You know, I suppose, of my marriage?’\n\nAnd there sprang up a dialogue concerning family matters of birth,\ndeath, and marriage, which it is not necessary to detail. Knight\npresently inquired:\n\n‘The young lady who changed into the other carriage is, then, your\nstepdaughter?’\n\n‘Yes, Elfride. You must know her.’\n\n‘And who was the lady in the carriage Elfride entered; who had an\nill-defined and watery look, as if she were only the reflection of\nherself in a pool?’\n\n‘Lady Luxellian; very weakly, Elfride says. My husband is remotely\nconnected with them; but there is not much intimacy on account of----.\nHowever, Henry, you’ll come and see us, of course. 24 Chevron Square.\nCome this week. We shall only be in town a week or two longer.’\n\n‘Let me see. I’ve got to run up to Oxford to-morrow, where I shall be\nfor several days; so that I must, I fear, lose the pleasure of seeing\nyou in London this year.’\n\n‘Then come to Endelstow; why not return with us?’\n\n‘I am afraid if I were to come before August I should have to leave\nagain in a day or two. I should be delighted to be with you at the\nbeginning of that month; and I could stay a nice long time. I have\nthought of going westward all the summer.’\n\n‘Very well. Now remember that’s a compact. And won’t you wait now and\nsee Mr. Swancourt? He will not be away ten minutes longer.’\n\n‘No; I’ll beg to be excused; for I must get to my chambers again this\nevening before I go home; indeed, I ought to have been there now--I have\nsuch a press of matters to attend to just at present. You will explain\nto him, please. Good-bye.’\n\n‘And let us know the day of your appearance as soon as you can.’\n\n‘I will’\n\n\n\n\nChapter XV\n\n    ‘A wandering voice.’\n\n\nThough sheer and intelligible griefs are not charmed away by being\nconfided to mere acquaintances, the process is a palliative to certain\nill-humours. Among these, perplexed vexation is one--a species of\ntrouble which, like a stream, gets shallower by the simple operation of\nwidening it in any quarter.\n\nOn the evening of the day succeeding that of the meeting in the\nPark, Elfride and Mrs. Swancourt were engaged in conversation in the\ndressing-room of the latter. Such a treatment of such a case was in\ncourse of adoption here.\n\nElfride had just before received an affectionate letter from Stephen\nSmith in Bombay, which had been forwarded to her from Endelstow. But\nsince this is not the case referred to, it is not worth while to pry\nfurther into the contents of the letter than to discover that, with rash\nthough pardonable confidence in coming times, he addressed her in high\nspirits as his darling future wife. Probably there cannot be instanced a\nbriefer and surer rule-of-thumb test of a man’s temperament--sanguine\nor cautious--than this: did he or does he ante-date the word wife in\ncorresponding with a sweet-heart he honestly loves?\n\nShe had taken this epistle into her own room, read a little of it, then\nSAVED the rest for to-morrow, not wishing to be so extravagant as to\nconsume the pleasure all at once. Nevertheless, she could not resist the\nwish to enjoy yet a little more, so out came the letter again, and in\nspite of misgivings as to prodigality the whole was devoured. The letter\nwas finally reperused and placed in her pocket.\n\nWhat was this? Also a newspaper for Elfride, which she had overlooked\nin her hurry to open the letter. It was the old number of the PRESENT,\ncontaining the article upon her book, forwarded as had been requested.\n\nElfride had hastily read it through, shrunk perceptibly smaller, and had\nthen gone with the paper in her hand to Mrs. Swancourt’s dressing-room,\nto lighten or at least modify her vexation by a discriminating estimate\nfrom her stepmother.\n\nShe was now looking disconsolately out of the window.\n\n‘Never mind, my child,’ said Mrs. Swancourt after a careful perusal of\nthe matter indicated. ‘I don’t see that the review is such a terrible\none, after all. Besides, everybody has forgotten about it by this time.\nI’m sure the opening is good enough for any book ever written. Just\nlisten--it sounds better read aloud than when you pore over it silently:\n“THE COURT OF KELLYON CASTLE. A ROMANCE OF THE MIDDLE AGES. BY ERNEST\nFIELD. In the belief that we were for a while escaping the monotonous\nrepetition of wearisome details in modern social scenery, analyses of\nuninteresting character, or the unnatural unfoldings of a sensation\nplot, we took this volume into our hands with a feeling of pleasure. We\nwere disposed to beguile ourselves with the fancy that some new change\nmight possibly be rung upon donjon keeps, chain and plate armour, deeply\nscarred cheeks, tender maidens disguised as pages, to which we had not\nlistened long ago.” Now, that’s a very good beginning, in my opinion,\nand one to be proud of having brought out of a man who has never seen\nyou.’\n\n‘Ah, yes,’ murmured Elfride wofully. ‘But, then, see further on!’\n\n‘Well the next bit is rather unkind, I must own,’ said Mrs. Swancourt,\nand read on. ‘“Instead of this we found ourselves in the hands of some\nyoung lady, hardly arrived at years of discretion, to judge by the silly\ndevice it has been thought worth while to adopt on the title-page, with\nthe idea of disguising her sex.”’\n\n‘I am not “silly”!’ said Elfride indignantly. ‘He might have called me\nanything but that.’\n\n‘You are not, indeed. Well:--“Hands of a young lady...whose chapters are\nsimply devoted to impossible tournaments, towers, and escapades, which\nread like flat copies of like scenes in the stories of Mr. G. P. R.\nJames, and the most unreal portions of IVANHOE. The bait is so palpably\nartificial that the most credulous gudgeon turns away.” Now, my dear,\nI don’t see overmuch to complain of in that. It proves that you were\nclever enough to make him think of Sir Walter Scott, which is a great\ndeal.’\n\n‘Oh yes; though I cannot romance myself, I am able to remind him of\nthose who can!’ Elfride intended to hurl these words sarcastically\nat her invisible enemy, but as she had no more satirical power than a\nwood-pigeon, they merely fell in a pretty murmur from lips shaped to a\npout.\n\n‘Certainly: and that’s something. Your book is good enough to be bad in\nan ordinary literary manner, and doesn’t stand by itself in a melancholy\nposition altogether worse than assailable.--“That interest in an\nhistorical romance may nowadays have any chance of being sustained, it\nis indispensable that the reader find himself under the guidance of\nsome nearly extinct species of legendary, who, in addition to an impulse\ntowards antiquarian research and an unweakened faith in the mediaeval\nhalo, shall possess an inventive faculty in which delicacy of sentiment\nis far overtopped by a power of welding to stirring incident a spirited\nvariety of the elementary human passions.” Well, that long-winded\neffusion doesn’t refer to you at all, Elfride, merely something put in\nto fill up. Let me see, when does he come to you again;...not till the\nvery end, actually. Here you are finally polished off:\n\n‘“But to return to the little work we have used as the text of this\narticle. We are far from altogether disparaging the author’s powers. She\nhas a certain versatility that enables her to use with effect a style\nof narration peculiar to herself, which may be called a murmuring of\ndelicate emotional trifles, the particular gift of those to whom the\nsocial sympathies of a peaceful time are as daily food. Hence, where\nmatters of domestic experience, and the natural touches which make\npeople real, can be introduced without anachronisms too striking, she is\noccasionally felicitous; and upon the whole we feel justified in saying\nthat the book will bear looking into for the sake of those portions\nwhich have nothing whatever to do with the story.”\n\n‘Well, I suppose it is intended for satire; but don’t think anything\nmore of it now, my dear. It is seven o’clock.’ And Mrs. Swancourt rang\nfor her maid.\n\nAttack is more piquant than concord. Stephen’s letter was concerning\nnothing but oneness with her: the review was the very reverse. And a\nstranger with neither name nor shape, age nor appearance, but a mighty\nvoice, is naturally rather an interesting novelty to a lady he chooses\nto address. When Elfride fell asleep that night she was loving the\nwriter of the letter, but thinking of the writer of that article.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVI\n\n     ‘Then fancy shapes--as fancy can.’\n\n\nOn a day about three weeks later, the Swancourt trio were sitting\nquietly in the drawing-room of The Crags, Mrs. Swancourt’s house at\nEndelstow, chatting, and taking easeful survey of their previous month\nor two of town--a tangible weariness even to people whose acquaintances\nthere might be counted on the fingers.\n\nA mere season in London with her practised step-mother had so advanced\nElfride’s perceptions, that her courtship by Stephen seemed emotionally\nmeagre, and to have drifted back several years into a childish past.\nIn regarding our mental experiences, as in visual observation, our own\nprogress reads like a dwindling of that we progress from.\n\nShe was seated on a low chair, looking over her romance with melancholy\ninterest for the first time since she had become acquainted with the\nremarks of the PRESENT thereupon.\n\n‘Still thinking of that reviewer, Elfie?’\n\n‘Not of him personally; but I am thinking of his opinion. Really, on\nlooking into the volume after this long time has elapsed, he seems to\nhave estimated one part of it fairly enough.’\n\n‘No, no; I wouldn’t show the white feather now! Fancy that of all people\nin the world the writer herself should go over to the enemy. How shall\nMonmouth’s men fight when Monmouth runs away?’\n\n‘I don’t do that. But I think he is right in some of his arguments,\nthough wrong in others. And because he has some claim to my respect I\nregret all the more that he should think so mistakenly of my motives in\none or two instances. It is more vexing to be misunderstood than to\nbe misrepresented; and he misunderstands me. I cannot be easy whilst\na person goes to rest night after night attributing to me intentions I\nnever had.’\n\n‘He doesn’t know your name, or anything about you. And he has doubtless\nforgotten there is such a book in existence by this time.’\n\n‘I myself should certainly like him to be put right upon one or two\nmatters,’ said the vicar, who had hitherto been silent. ‘You see,\ncritics go on writing, and are never corrected or argued with, and\ntherefore are never improved.’\n\n‘Papa,’ said Elfride brightening, ‘write to him!’\n\n‘I would as soon write to him as look at him, for the matter of that,’\nsaid Mr. Swancourt.\n\n‘Do! And say, the young person who wrote the book did not adopt a\nmasculine pseudonym in vanity or conceit, but because she was afraid it\nwould be thought presumptuous to publish her name, and that she did not\nmean the story for such as he, but as a sweetener of history for young\npeople, who might thereby acquire a taste for what went on in their own\ncountry hundreds of years ago, and be tempted to dive deeper into the\nsubject. Oh, there is so much to explain; I wish I might write myself!’\n\n‘Now, Elfie, I’ll tell you what we will do,’ answered Mr. Swancourt,\ntickled with a sort of bucolic humour at the idea of criticizing the\ncritic. ‘You shall write a clear account of what he is wrong in, and I\nwill copy it and send it as mine.’\n\n‘Yes, now, directly!’ said Elfride, jumping up. ‘When will you send it,\npapa?’\n\n‘Oh, in a day or two, I suppose,’ he returned. Then the vicar paused and\nslightly yawned, and in the manner of elderly people began to cool from\nhis ardour for the undertaking now that it came to the point. ‘But,\nreally, it is hardly worth while,’ he said.\n\n‘O papa!’ said Elfride, with much disappointment. ‘You said you would,\nand now you won’t. That is not fair!’\n\n‘But how can we send it if we don’t know whom to send it to?’\n\n‘If you really want to send such a thing it can easily be done,’ said\nMrs. Swancourt, coming to her step-daughter’s rescue. ‘An envelope\naddressed, “To the Critic of THE COURT OF KELLYON CASTLE, care of the\nEditor of the PRESENT,” would find him.’\n\n‘Yes, I suppose it would.’\n\n‘Why not write your answer yourself, Elfride?’ Mrs. Swancourt inquired.\n\n‘I might,’ she said hesitatingly; ‘and send it anonymously: that would\nbe treating him as he has treated me.’\n\n‘No use in the world!’\n\n‘But I don’t like to let him know my exact name. Suppose I put my\ninitials only? The less you are known the more you are thought of.’\n\n‘Yes; you might do that.’\n\nElfride set to work there and then. Her one desire for the last\nfortnight seemed likely to be realized. As happens with sensitive and\nsecluded minds, a continual dwelling upon the subject had magnified to\ncolossal proportions the space she assumed herself to occupy or to have\noccupied in the occult critic’s mind. At noon and at night she had\nbeen pestering herself with endeavours to perceive more distinctly his\nconception of her as a woman apart from an author: whether he really\ndespised her; whether he thought more or less of her than of ordinary\nyoung women who never ventured into the fire of criticism at all. Now\nshe would have the satisfaction of feeling that at any rate he knew\nher true intent in crossing his path, and annoying him so by her\nperformance, and be taught perhaps to despise it a little less.\n\nFour days later an envelope, directed to Miss Swancourt in a strange\nhand, made its appearance from the post-bag.\n\n‘Oh,’ said Elfride, her heart sinking within her. ‘Can it be from that\nman--a lecture for impertinence? And actually one for Mrs. Swancourt in\nthe same hand-writing!’ She feared to open hers. ‘Yet how can he know my\nname? No; it is somebody else.’\n\n‘Nonsense!’ said her father grimly. ‘You sent your initials, and the\nDirectory was available. Though he wouldn’t have taken the trouble to\nlook there unless he had been thoroughly savage with you. I thought\nyou wrote with rather more asperity than simple literary discussion\nrequired.’ This timely clause was introduced to save the character of\nthe vicar’s judgment under any issue of affairs.\n\n‘Well, here I go,’ said Elfride, desperately tearing open the seal.\n\n‘To be sure, of course,’ exclaimed Mrs. Swancourt; and looking up\nfrom her own letter. ‘Christopher, I quite forgot to tell you, when\nI mentioned that I had seen my distant relative, Harry Knight, that I\ninvited him here for whatever length of time he could spare. And now he\nsays he can come any day in August.’\n\n‘Write, and say the first of the month,’ replied the indiscriminate\nvicar.\n\nShe read on, ‘Goodness me--and that isn’t all. He is actually the\nreviewer of Elfride’s book. How absurd, to be sure! I had no idea\nhe reviewed novels or had anything to do with the PRESENT. He is a\nbarrister--and I thought he only wrote in the Quarterlies. Why, Elfride,\nyou have brought about an odd entanglement! What does he say to you?’\n\nElfride had put down her letter with a dissatisfied flush on her face.\n‘I don’t know. The idea of his knowing my name and all about me!...Why,\nhe says nothing particular, only this--\n\n\n‘“MY DEAR MADAM,--Though I am sorry that my remarks should have seemed\nharsh to you, it is a pleasure to find that they have been the means of\nbringing forth such an ingeniously argued reply. Unfortunately, it is\nso long since I wrote my review, that my memory does not serve me\nsufficiently to say a single word in my defence, even supposing there\nremains one to be said, which is doubtful. You will find from a letter\nI have written to Mrs. Swancourt, that we are not such strangers to each\nother as we have been imagining. Possibly, I may have the pleasure of\nseeing you soon, when any argument you choose to advance shall receive\nall the attention it deserves.”\n\n\n‘That is dim sarcasm--I know it is.’\n\n‘Oh no, Elfride.’\n\n‘And then, his remarks didn’t seem harsh--I mean I did not say so.’\n\n‘He thinks you are in a frightful temper,’ said Mr. Swancourt, chuckling\nin undertones.\n\n‘And he will come and see me, and find the authoress as contemptible in\nspeech as she has been impertinent in manner. I do heartily wish I had\nnever written a word to him!’\n\n‘Never mind,’ said Mrs. Swancourt, also laughing in low quiet jerks; ‘it\nwill make the meeting such a comical affair, and afford splendid by-play\nfor your father and myself. The idea of our running our heads against\nHarry Knight all the time! I cannot get over that.’\n\nThe vicar had immediately remembered the name to be that of Stephen\nSmith’s preceptor and friend; but having ceased to concern himself in\nthe matter he made no remark to that effect, consistently forbearing\nto allude to anything which could restore recollection of the (to him)\ndisagreeable mistake with regard to poor Stephen’s lineage and position.\nElfride had of course perceived the same thing, which added to the\ncomplication of relationship a mesh that her stepmother knew nothing of.\n\nThe identification scarcely heightened Knight’s attractions now, though\na twelvemonth ago she would only have cared to see him for the interest\nhe possessed as Stephen’s friend. Fortunately for Knight’s advent, such\na reason for welcome had only begun to be awkward to her at a time\nwhen the interest he had acquired on his own account made it no longer\nnecessary.\n\n\nThese coincidences, in common with all relating to him, tended to keep\nElfride’s mind upon the stretch concerning Knight. As was her custom\nwhen upon the horns of a dilemma, she walked off by herself among the\nlaurel bushes, and there, standing still and splitting up a leaf without\nremoving it from its stalk, fetched back recollections of Stephen’s\nfrequent words in praise of his friend, and wished she had listened\nmore attentively. Then, still pulling the leaf, she would blush at some\nfancied mortification that would accrue to her from his words when they\nmet, in consequence of her intrusiveness, as she now considered it, in\nwriting to him.\n\nThe next development of her meditations was the subject of what this\nman’s personal appearance might be--was he tall or short, dark or fair,\ngay or grim? She would have asked Mrs. Swancourt but for the risk she\nmight thereby incur of some teasing remark being returned. Ultimately\nElfride would say, ‘Oh, what a plague that reviewer is to me!’ and turn\nher face to where she imagined India lay, and murmur to herself, ‘Ah,\nmy little husband, what are you doing now? Let me see, where are\nyou--south, east, where? Behind that hill, ever so far behind!’\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVII\n\n     ‘Her welcome, spoke in faltering phrase.’\n\n\n‘There is Henry Knight, I declare!’ said Mrs. Swancourt one day.\n\nThey were gazing from the jutting angle of a wild enclosure not far from\nThe Crags, which almost overhung the valley already described as leading\nup from the sea and little port of Castle Boterel. The stony escarpment\nupon which they stood had the contour of a man’s face, and it was\ncovered with furze as with a beard. People in the field above were\npreserved from an accidental roll down these prominences and hollows\nby a hedge on the very crest, which was doing that kindly service for\nElfride and her mother now.\n\nScrambling higher into the hedge and stretching her neck further over\nthe furze, Elfride beheld the individual signified. He was walking\nleisurely along the little green path at the bottom, beside the stream,\na satchel slung upon his left hip, a stout walking-stick in his hand,\nand a brown-holland sun-hat upon his head. The satchel was worn and old,\nand the outer polished surface of the leather was cracked and peeling\noff.\n\nKnight having arrived over the hills to Castle Boterel upon the top of a\ncrazy omnibus, preferred to walk the remaining two miles up the valley,\nleaving his luggage to be brought on.\n\nBehind him wandered, helter-skelter, a boy of whom Knight had briefly\ninquired the way to Endelstow; and by that natural law of physics which\ncauses lesser bodies to gravitate towards the greater, this boy had\nkept near to Knight, and trotted like a little dog close at his heels,\nwhistling as he went, with his eyes fixed upon Knight’s boots as they\nrose and fell.\n\nWhen they had reached a point precisely opposite that in which Mrs. and\nMiss Swancourt lay in ambush, Knight stopped and turned round.\n\n‘Look here, my boy,’ he said.\n\nThe boy parted his lips, opened his eyes, and answered nothing.\n\n‘Here’s sixpence for you, on condition that you don’t again come within\ntwenty yards of my heels, all the way up the valley.’\n\nThe boy, who apparently had not known he had been looking at Knight’s\nheels at all, took the sixpence mechanically, and Knight went on again,\nwrapt in meditation.\n\n‘A nice voice,’ Elfride thought; ‘but what a singular temper!’\n\n‘Now we must get indoors before he ascends the slope,’ said Mrs.\nSwancourt softly. And they went across by a short cut over a stile,\nentering the lawn by a side door, and so on to the house.\n\nMr. Swancourt had gone into the village with the curate, and Elfride\nfelt too nervous to await their visitor’s arrival in the drawing-room\nwith Mrs. Swancourt. So that when the elder lady entered, Elfride made\nsome pretence of perceiving a new variety of crimson geranium, and\nlingered behind among the flower beds.\n\nThere was nothing gained by this, after all, she thought; and a few\nminutes after boldly came into the house by the glass side-door. She\nwalked along the corridor, and entered the drawing-room. Nobody was\nthere.\n\nA window at the angle of the room opened directly into an octagonal\nconservatory, enclosing the corner of the building. From the\nconservatory came voices in conversation--Mrs. Swancourt’s and the\nstranger’s.\n\nShe had expected him to talk brilliantly. To her surprise he was asking\nquestions in quite a learner’s manner, on subjects connected with the\nflowers and shrubs that she had known for years. When after the lapse of\na few minutes he spoke at some length, she considered there was a hard\nsquare decisiveness in the shape of his sentences, as if, unlike her own\nand Stephen’s, they were not there and then newly constructed, but were\ndrawn forth from a large store ready-made. They were now approaching the\nwindow to come in again.\n\n‘That is a flesh-coloured variety,’ said Mrs. Swancourt. ‘But oleanders,\nthough they are such bulky shrubs, are so very easily wounded as to be\nunprunable--giants with the sensitiveness of young ladies. Oh, here is\nElfride!’\n\nElfride looked as guilty and crestfallen as Lady Teazle at the dropping\nof the screen. Mrs. Swancourt presented him half comically, and Knight\nin a minute or two placed himself beside the young lady.\n\nA complexity of instincts checked Elfride’s conventional smiles of\ncomplaisance and hospitality; and, to make her still less comfortable,\nMrs. Swancourt immediately afterwards left them together to seek her\nhusband. Mr. Knight, however, did not seem at all incommoded by his\nfeelings, and he said with light easefulness:\n\n‘So, Miss Swancourt, I have met you at last. You escaped me by a few\nminutes only when we were in London.’\n\n‘Yes. I found that you had seen Mrs. Swancourt.’\n\n‘And now reviewer and reviewed are face to face,’ he added\nunconcernedly.\n\n‘Yes: though the fact of your being a relation of Mrs. Swancourt’s takes\noff the edge of it. It was strange that you should be one of her family\nall the time.’ Elfride began to recover herself now, and to look into\nKnight’s face. ‘I was merely anxious to let you know my REAL meaning in\nwriting the book--extremely anxious.’\n\n‘I can quite understand the wish; and I was gratified that my remarks\nshould have reached home. They very seldom do, I am afraid.’\n\nElfride drew herself in. Here he was, sticking to his opinions as\nfirmly as if friendship and politeness did not in the least require an\nimmediate renunciation of them.\n\n‘You made me very uneasy and sorry by writing such things!’ she\nmurmured, suddenly dropping the mere cacueterie of a fashionable first\nintroduction, and speaking with some of the dudgeon of a child towards a\nsevere schoolmaster.\n\n‘That is rather the object of honest critics in such a case. Not to\ncause unnecessary sorrow, but: “To make you sorry after a proper manner,\nthat ye may receive damage by us in nothing,” as a powerful pen once\nwrote to the Gentiles. Are you going to write another romance?’\n\n‘Write another?’ she said. ‘That somebody may pen a condemnation and\n“nail’t wi’ Scripture” again, as you do now, Mr. Knight?’\n\n‘You may do better next time,’ he said placidly: ‘I think you will. But\nI would advise you to confine yourself to domestic scenes.’\n\n‘Thank you. But never again!’\n\n‘Well, you may be right. That a young woman has taken to writing is not\nby any means the best thing to hear about her.’\n\n‘What is the best?’\n\n‘I prefer not to say.’\n\n‘Do you know? Then, do tell me, please.’\n\n‘Well’--(Knight was evidently changing his meaning)--‘I suppose to hear\nthat she has married.’\n\nElfride hesitated. ‘And what when she has been married?’ she said at\nlast, partly in order to withdraw her own person from the argument.\n\n‘Then to hear no more about her. It is as Smeaton said of his\nlighthouse: her greatest real praise, when the novelty of her\ninauguration has worn off, is that nothing happens to keep the talk of\nher alive.’\n\n‘Yes, I see,’ said Elfride softly and thoughtfully. ‘But of course it is\ndifferent quite with men. Why don’t you write novels, Mr. Knight?’\n\n‘Because I couldn’t write one that would interest anybody.’\n\n‘Why?’\n\n‘For several reasons. It requires a judicious omission of your real\nthoughts to make a novel popular, for one thing.’\n\n‘Is that really necessary? Well, I am sure you could learn to do that\nwith practice,’ said Elfride with an ex-cathedra air, as became a person\nwho spoke from experience in the art. ‘You would make a great name for\ncertain,’ she continued.\n\n‘So many people make a name nowadays, that it is more distinguished to\nremain in obscurity.’\n\n‘Tell me seriously--apart from the subject--why don’t you write a volume\ninstead of loose articles?’ she insisted.\n\n‘Since you are pleased to make me talk of myself, I will tell you\nseriously,’ said Knight, not less amused at this catechism by his young\nfriend than he was interested in her appearance. ‘As I have implied, I\nhave not the wish. And if I had the wish, I could not now concentrate\nsufficiently. We all have only our one cruse of energy given us to make\nthe best of. And where that energy has been leaked away week by week,\nquarter by quarter, as mine has for the last nine or ten years, there is\nnot enough dammed back behind the mill at any given period to supply\nthe force a complete book on any subject requires. Then there is the\nself-confidence and waiting power. Where quick results have grown\ncustomary, they are fatal to a lively faith in the future.’\n\n‘Yes, I comprehend; and so you choose to write in fragments?’\n\n‘No, I don’t choose to do it in the sense you mean; choosing from a\nwhole world of professions, all possible. It was by the constraint of\naccident merely. Not that I object to the accident.’\n\n‘Why don’t you object--I mean, why do you feel so quiet about things?’\nElfride was half afraid to question him so, but her intense curiosity to\nsee what the inside of literary Mr. Knight was like, kept her going on.\n\nKnight certainly did not mind being frank with her. Instances of this\ntrait in men who are not without feeling, but are reticent from habit,\nmay be recalled by all of us. When they find a listener who can by no\npossibility make use of them, rival them, or condemn them, reserved and\neven suspicious men of the world become frank, keenly enjoying the inner\nside of their frankness.\n\n‘Why I don’t mind the accidental constraint,’ he replied, ‘is because,\nin making beginnings, a chance limitation of direction is often better\nthan absolute freedom.’\n\n‘I see--that is, I should if I quite understood what all those\ngeneralities mean.’\n\n‘Why, this: That an arbitrary foundation for one’s work, which no length\nof thought can alter, leaves the attention free to fix itself on the\nwork itself, and make the best of it.’\n\n‘Lateral compression forcing altitude, as would be said in that tongue,’\nshe said mischievously. ‘And I suppose where no limit exists, as in the\ncase of a rich man with a wide taste who wants to do something, it will\nbe better to choose a limit capriciously than to have none.’\n\n‘Yes,’ he said meditatively. ‘I can go as far as that.’\n\n‘Well,’ resumed Elfride, ‘I think it better for a man’s nature if he\ndoes nothing in particular.’\n\n‘There is such a case as being obliged to.’\n\n‘Yes, yes; I was speaking of when you are not obliged for any other\nreason than delight in the prospect of fame. I have thought many times\nlately that a thin widespread happiness, commencing now, and of a piece\nwith the days of your life, is preferable to an anticipated heap far\naway in the future, and none now.’\n\n‘Why, that’s the very thing I said just now as being the principle of\nall ephemeral doers like myself.’\n\n‘Oh, I am sorry to have parodied you,’ she said with some confusion.\n‘Yes, of course. That is what you meant about not trying to be famous.’\nAnd she added, with the quickness of conviction characteristic of her\nmind: ‘There is much littleness in trying to be great. A man must think\na good deal of himself, and be conceited enough to believe in himself,\nbefore he tries at all.’\n\n‘But it is soon enough to say there is harm in a man’s thinking a good\ndeal of himself when it is proved he has been thinking wrong, and too\nsoon then sometimes. Besides, we should not conclude that a man who\nstrives earnestly for success does so with a strong sense of his own\nmerit. He may see how little success has to do with merit, and his\nmotive may be his very humility.’\n\nThis manner of treating her rather provoked Elfride. No sooner did she\nagree with him than he ceased to seem to wish it, and took the other\nside. ‘Ah,’ she thought inwardly, ‘I shall have nothing to do with a man\nof this kind, though he is our visitor.’\n\n‘I think you will find,’ resumed Knight, pursuing the conversation\nmore for the sake of finishing off his thoughts on the subject than for\nengaging her attention, ‘that in actual life it is merely a matter of\ninstinct with men--this trying to push on. They awake to a recognition\nthat they have, without premeditation, begun to try a little, and they\nsay to themselves, “Since I have tried thus much, I will try a little\nmore.” They go on because they have begun.’\n\nElfride, in her turn, was not particularly attending to his words at\nthis moment. She had, unconsciously to herself, a way of seizing any\npoint in the remarks of an interlocutor which interested her, and\ndwelling upon it, and thinking thoughts of her own thereupon, totally\noblivious of all that he might say in continuation. On such occasions\nshe artlessly surveyed the person speaking; and then there was a time\nfor a painter. Her eyes seemed to look at you, and past you, as you were\nthen, into your future; and past your future into your eternity--not\nreading it, but gazing in an unused, unconscious way--her mind still\nclinging to its original thought.\n\nThis is how she was looking at Knight.\n\nSuddenly Elfride became conscious of what she was doing, and was\npainfully confused.\n\n‘What were you so intent upon in me?’ he inquired.\n\n‘As far as I was thinking of you at all, I was thinking how clever you\nare,’ she said, with a want of premeditation that was startling in its\nhonesty and simplicity.\n\nFeeling restless now that she had so unwittingly spoken, she arose and\nstepped to the window, having heard the voices of her father and Mrs.\nSwancourt coming up below the terrace. ‘Here they are,’ she said, going\nout. Knight walked out upon the lawn behind her. She stood upon the edge\nof the terrace, close to the stone balustrade, and looked towards the\nsun, hanging over a glade just now fair as Tempe’s vale, up which her\nfather was walking.\n\nKnight could not help looking at her. The sun was within ten degrees\nof the horizon, and its warm light flooded her face and heightened the\nbright rose colour of her cheeks to a vermilion red, their moderate pink\nhue being only seen in its natural tone where the cheek curved round\ninto shadow. The ends of her hanging hair softly dragged themselves\nbackwards and forwards upon her shoulder as each faint breeze thrust\nagainst or relinquished it. Fringes and ribbons of her dress, moved by\nthe same breeze, licked like tongues upon the parts around them, and\nfluttering forward from shady folds caught likewise their share of the\nlustrous orange glow.\n\nMr. Swancourt shouted out a welcome to Knight from a distance of\nabout thirty yards, and after a few preliminary words proceeded to a\nconversation of deep earnestness on Knight’s fine old family name, and\ntheories as to lineage and intermarriage connected therewith. Knight’s\nportmanteau having in the meantime arrived, they soon retired to prepare\nfor dinner, which had been postponed two hours later than the usual time\nof that meal.\n\nAn arrival was an event in the life of Elfride, now that they were again\nin the country, and that of Knight necessarily an engrossing one. And\nthat evening she went to bed for the first time without thinking of\nStephen at all.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII\n\n     ‘He heard her musical pants.’\n\n\nThe old tower of West Endelstow Church had reached the last weeks of its\nexistence. It was to be replaced by a new one from the designs of Mr.\nHewby, the architect who had sent down Stephen. Planks and poles had\narrived in the churchyard, iron bars had been thrust into the venerable\ncrack extending down the belfry wall to the foundation, the bells had\nbeen taken down, the owls had forsaken this home of their forefathers,\nand six iconoclasts in white fustian, to whom a cracked edifice was a\nspecies of Mumbo Jumbo, had taken lodgings in the village previous to\nbeginning the actual removal of the stones.\n\nThis was the day after Knight’s arrival. To enjoy for the last time the\nprospect seaward from the summit, the vicar, Mrs. Swancourt, Knight, and\nElfride, all ascended the winding turret--Mr. Swancourt stepping\nforward with many loud breaths, his wife struggling along silently, but\nsuffering none the less. They had hardly reached the top when a large\nlurid cloud, palpably a reservoir of rain, thunder, and lightning, was\nseen to be advancing overhead from the north.\n\nThe two cautious elders suggested an immediate return, and proceeded to\nput it in practice as regarded themselves.\n\n‘Dear me, I wish I had not come up,’ exclaimed Mrs. Swancourt.\n\n‘We shall be slower than you two in going down,’ the vicar said over his\nshoulder, ‘and so, don’t you start till we are nearly at the bottom, or\nyou will run over us and break our necks somewhere in the darkness of\nthe turret.’\n\nAccordingly Elfride and Knight waited on the leads till the staircase\nshould be clear. Knight was not in a talkative mood that morning.\nElfride was rather wilful, by reason of his inattention, which she\nprivately set down to his thinking her not worth talking to. Whilst\nKnight stood watching the rise of the cloud, she sauntered to the other\nside of the tower, and there remembered a giddy feat she had performed\nthe year before. It was to walk round upon the parapet of the\ntower--which was quite without battlement or pinnacle, and presented a\nsmooth flat surface about two feet wide, forming a pathway on all the\nfour sides. Without reflecting in the least upon what she was doing she\nnow stepped upon the parapet in the old way, and began walking along.\n\n‘We are down, cousin Henry,’ cried Mrs. Swancourt up the turret. ‘Follow\nus when you like.’\n\nKnight turned and saw Elfride beginning her elevated promenade. His face\nflushed with mingled concern and anger at her rashness.\n\n‘I certainly gave you credit for more common sense,’ he said.\n\nShe reddened a little and walked on.\n\n‘Miss Swancourt, I insist upon your coming down,’ he exclaimed.\n\n‘I will in a minute. I am safe enough. I have done it often.’\n\nAt that moment, by reason of a slight perturbation his words had caused\nin her, Elfride’s foot caught itself in a little tuft of grass growing\nin a joint of the stone-work, and she almost lost her balance. Knight\nsprang forward with a face of horror. By what seemed the special\ninterposition of a considerate Providence she tottered to the inner edge\nof the parapet instead of to the outer, and reeled over upon the lead\nroof two or three feet below the wall.\n\nKnight seized her as in a vice, and he said, panting, ‘That ever I\nshould have met a woman fool enough to do a thing of that kind! Good\nGod, you ought to be ashamed of yourself!’\n\nThe close proximity of the Shadow of Death had made her sick and pale\nas a corpse before he spoke. Already lowered to that state, his words\ncompletely over-powered her, and she swooned away as he held her.\n\nElfride’s eyes were not closed for more than forty seconds. She opened\nthem, and remembered the position instantly. His face had altered its\nexpression from stern anger to pity. But his severe remarks had rather\nfrightened her, and she struggled to be free.\n\n‘If you can stand, of course you may,’ he said, and loosened his arms.\n‘I hardly know whether most to laugh at your freak or to chide you for\nits folly.’\n\nShe immediately sank upon the lead-work. Knight lifted her again. ‘Are\nyou hurt?’ he said.\n\nShe murmured an incoherent expression, and tried to smile; saying, with\na fitful aversion of her face, ‘I am only frightened. Put me down, do\nput me down!’\n\n‘But you can’t walk,’ said Knight.\n\n‘You don’t know that; how can you? I am only frightened, I tell you,’\nshe answered petulantly, and raised her hand to her forehead. Knight\nthen saw that she was bleeding from a severe cut in her wrist,\napparently where it had descended upon a salient corner of the\nlead-work. Elfride, too, seemed to perceive and feel this now for the\nfirst time, and for a minute nearly lost consciousness again. Knight\nrapidly bound his handkerchief round the place, and to add to the\ncomplication, the thundercloud he had been watching began to shed some\nheavy drops of rain. Knight looked up and saw the vicar striding towards\nthe house, and Mrs. Swancourt waddling beside him like a hard-driven\nduck.\n\n‘As you are so faint, it will be much better to let me carry you down,’\nsaid Knight; ‘or at any rate inside out of the rain.’ But her objection\nto be lifted made it impossible for him to support her for more than\nfive steps.\n\n‘This is folly, great folly,’ he exclaimed, setting her down.\n\n‘Indeed!’ she murmured, with tears in her eyes. ‘I say I will not be\ncarried, and you say this is folly!’\n\n‘So it is.’\n\n‘No, it isn’t!’\n\n‘It is folly, I think. At any rate, the origin of it all is.’\n\n‘I don’t agree to it. And you needn’t get so angry with me; I am not\nworth it.’\n\n‘Indeed you are. You are worth the enmity of princes, as was said of\nsuch another. Now, then, will you clasp your hands behind my neck, that\nI may carry you down without hurting you?’\n\n‘No, no.’\n\n‘You had better, or I shall foreclose.’\n\n‘What’s that!’\n\n‘Deprive you of your chance.’\n\nElfride gave a little toss.\n\n‘Now, don’t writhe so when I attempt to carry you.’\n\n‘I can’t help it.’\n\n‘Then submit quietly.’\n\n‘I don’t care. I don’t care,’ she murmured in languid tones and with\nclosed eyes.\n\nHe took her into his arms, entered the turret, and with slow and\ncautious steps descended round and round. Then, with the gentleness of\na nursing mother, he attended to the cut on her arm. During his progress\nthrough the operations of wiping it and binding it up anew, her face\nchanged its aspect from pained indifference to something like bashful\ninterest, interspersed with small tremors and shudders of a trifling\nkind.\n\nIn the centre of each pale cheek a small red spot the size of a wafer\nhad now made its appearance, and continued to grow larger. Elfride\nmomentarily expected a recurrence to the lecture on her foolishness, but\nKnight said no more than this--\n\n‘Promise me NEVER to walk on that parapet again.’\n\n‘It will be pulled down soon: so I do.’ In a few minutes she continued\nin a lower tone, and seriously, ‘You are familiar of course, as\neverybody is, with those strange sensations we sometimes have, that our\nlife for the moment exists in duplicate.’\n\n‘That we have lived through that moment before?’\n\n‘Or shall again. Well, I felt on the tower that something similar to\nthat scene is again to be common to us both.’\n\n‘God forbid!’ said Knight. ‘Promise me that you will never again walk on\nany such place on any consideration.’\n\n‘I do.’\n\n‘That such a thing has not been before, we know. That it shall not be\nagain, you vow. Therefore think no more of such a foolish fancy.’\n\nThere had fallen a great deal of rain, but unaccompanied by lightning. A\nfew minutes longer, and the storm had ceased.\n\n‘Now, take my arm, please.’\n\n‘Oh no, it is not necessary.’ This relapse into wilfulness was because\nhe had again connected the epithet foolish with her.\n\n‘Nonsense: it is quite necessary; it will rain again directly, and you\nare not half recovered.’ And without more ado Knight took her hand, drew\nit under his arm, and held it there so firmly that she could not have\nremoved it without a struggle. Feeling like a colt in a halter for the\nfirst time, at thus being led along, yet afraid to be angry, it was to\nher great relief that she saw the carriage coming round the corner to\nfetch them.\n\nHer fall upon the roof was necessarily explained to some extent upon\ntheir entering the house; but both forbore to mention a word of what she\nhad been doing to cause such an accident. During the remainder of the\nafternoon Elfride was invisible; but at dinner-time she appeared as\nbright as ever.\n\nIn the drawing-room, after having been exclusively engaged with Mr. and\nMrs. Swancourt through the intervening hour, Knight again found himself\nthrown with Elfride. She had been looking over a chess problem in one of\nthe illustrated periodicals.\n\n‘You like chess, Miss Swancourt?’\n\n‘Yes. It is my favourite scientific game; indeed, excludes every other.\nDo you play?’\n\n‘I have played; though not lately.’\n\n‘Challenge him, Elfride,’ said the vicar heartily. ‘She plays very well\nfor a lady, Mr. Knight.’\n\n‘Shall we play?’ asked Elfride tentatively.\n\n‘Oh, certainly. I shall be delighted.’\n\nThe game began. Mr. Swancourt had forgotten a similar performance with\nStephen Smith the year before. Elfride had not; but she had begun to\ntake for her maxim the undoubted truth that the necessity of continuing\nfaithful to Stephen, without suspicion, dictated a fickle behaviour\nalmost as imperatively as fickleness itself; a fact, however, which\nwould give a startling advantage to the latter quality should it ever\nappear.\n\nKnight, by one of those inexcusable oversights which will sometimes\nafflict the best of players, placed his rook in the arms of one of her\npawns. It was her first advantage. She looked triumphant--even ruthless.\n\n‘By George! what was I thinking of?’ said Knight quietly; and then\ndismissed all concern at his accident.\n\n‘Club laws we’ll have, won’t we, Mr. Knight?’ said Elfride suasively.\n\n‘Oh yes, certainly,’ said Mr. Knight, a thought, however, just occurring\nto his mind, that he had two or three times allowed her to replace a\nman on her religiously assuring him that such a move was an absolute\nblunder.\n\nShe immediately took up the unfortunate rook and the contest proceeded,\nElfride having now rather the better of the game. Then he won the\nexchange, regained his position, and began to press her hard. Elfride\ngrew flurried, and placed her queen on his remaining rook’s file.\n\n‘There--how stupid! Upon my word, I did not see your rook. Of course\nnobody but a fool would have put a queen there knowingly!’\n\nShe spoke excitedly, half expecting her antagonist to give her back the\nmove.\n\n‘Nobody, of course,’ said Knight serenely, and stretched out his hand\ntowards his royal victim.\n\n‘It is not very pleasant to have it taken advantage of, then,’ she said\nwith some vexation.\n\n‘Club laws, I think you said?’ returned Knight blandly, and mercilessly\nappropriating the queen.\n\nShe was on the brink of pouting, but was ashamed to show it; tears\nalmost stood in her eyes. She had been trying so hard--so very\nhard--thinking and thinking till her brain was in a whirl; and it seemed\nso heartless of him to treat her so, after all.\n\n‘I think it is----’ she began.\n\n‘What?’\n\n--‘Unkind to take advantage of a pure mistake I make in that way.’\n\n‘I lost my rook by even a purer mistake,’ said the enemy in an\ninexorable tone, without lifting his eyes.\n\n‘Yes, but----’ However, as his logic was absolutely unanswerable, she\nmerely registered a protest. ‘I cannot endure those cold-blooded ways of\nclubs and professional players, like Staunton and Morphy. Just as if it\nreally mattered whether you have raised your fingers from a man or no!’\n\nKnight smiled as pitilessly as before, and they went on in silence.\n\n‘Checkmate,’ said Knight.\n\n‘Another game,’ said Elfride peremptorily, and looking very warm.\n\n‘With all my heart,’ said Knight.\n\n‘Checkmate,’ said Knight again at the end of forty minutes.\n\n‘Another game,’ she returned resolutely.\n\n‘I’ll give you the odds of a bishop,’ Knight said to her kindly.\n\n‘No, thank you,’ Elfride replied in a tone intended for courteous\nindifference; but, as a fact, very cavalier indeed.\n\n‘Checkmate,’ said her opponent without the least emotion.\n\nOh, the difference between Elfride’s condition of mind now, and when she\npurposely made blunders that Stephen Smith might win!\n\nIt was bedtime. Her mind as distracted as if it would throb itself out\nof her head, she went off to her chamber, full of mortification at being\nbeaten time after time when she herself was the aggressor. Having for\ntwo or three years enjoyed the reputation throughout the globe of her\nfather’s brain--which almost constituted her entire world--of being an\nexcellent player, this fiasco was intolerable; for unfortunately the\nperson most dogged in the belief in a false reputation is always that\none, the possessor, who has the best means of knowing that it is not\ntrue.\n\nIn bed no sleep came to soothe her; that gentle thing being the very\nmiddle-of-summer friend in this respect of flying away at the merest\ntroublous cloud. After lying awake till two o’clock an idea seemed to\nstrike her. She softly arose, got a light, and fetched a Chess Praxis\nfrom the library. Returning and sitting up in bed, she diligently\nstudied the volume till the clock struck five, and her eyelids felt\nthick and heavy. She then extinguished the light and lay down again.\n\n‘You look pale, Elfride,’ said Mrs. Swancourt the next morning at\nbreakfast. ‘Isn’t she, cousin Harry?’\n\nA young girl who is scarcely ill at all can hardly help becoming so when\nregarded as such by all eyes turning upon her at the table in obedience\nto some remark. Everybody looked at Elfride. She certainly was pale.\n\n‘Am I pale?’ she said with a faint smile. ‘I did not sleep much. I could\nnot get rid of armies of bishops and knights, try how I would.’\n\n‘Chess is a bad thing just before bedtime; especially for excitable\npeople like yourself, dear. Don’t ever play late again.’\n\n‘I’ll play early instead. Cousin Knight,’ she said in imitation of Mrs.\nSwancourt, ‘will you oblige me in something?’\n\n‘Even to half my kingdom.’\n\n‘Well, it is to play one game more.’\n\n‘When?’\n\n‘Now, instantly; the moment we have breakfasted.’\n\n‘Nonsense, Elfride,’ said her father. ‘Making yourself a slave to the\ngame like that.’\n\n‘But I want to, papa! Honestly, I am restless at having been so\nignominiously overcome. And Mr. Knight doesn’t mind. So what harm can\nthere be?’\n\n‘Let us play, by all means, if you wish it,’ said Knight.\n\nSo, when breakfast was over, the combatants withdrew to the quiet of the\nlibrary, and the door was closed. Elfride seemed to have an idea\nthat her conduct was rather ill-regulated and startlingly free from\nconventional restraint. And worse, she fancied upon Knight’s face a\nslightly amused look at her proceedings.\n\n‘You think me foolish, I suppose,’ she said recklessly; ‘but I want to\ndo my very best just once, and see whether I can overcome you.’\n\n‘Certainly: nothing more natural. Though I am afraid it is not the plan\nadopted by women of the world after a defeat.’\n\n‘Why, pray?’\n\n‘Because they know that as good as overcoming is skill in effacing\nrecollection of being overcome, and turn their attention to that\nentirely.’\n\n‘I am wrong again, of course.’\n\n‘Perhaps your wrong is more pleasing than their right.’\n\n‘I don’t quite know whether you mean that, or whether you are laughing\nat me,’ she said, looking doubtingly at him, yet inclining to accept the\nmore flattering interpretation. ‘I am almost sure you think it vanity in\nme to think I am a match for you. Well, if you do, I say that vanity is\nno crime in such a case.’\n\n‘Well, perhaps not. Though it is hardly a virtue.’\n\n‘Oh yes, in battle! Nelson’s bravery lay in his vanity.’\n\n‘Indeed! Then so did his death.’\n\nOh no, no! For it is written in the book of the prophet Shakespeare--\n\n\n   “Fear and be slain? no worse can come to fight;\n    And fight and die, is death destroying death!”\n\n\nAnd down they sat, and the contest began, Elfride having the first move.\nThe game progressed. Elfride’s heart beat so violently that she could\nnot sit still. Her dread was lest he should hear it. And he did discover\nit at last--some flowers upon the table being set throbbing by its\npulsations.\n\n‘I think we had better give over,’ said Knight, looking at her gently.\n‘It is too much for you, I know. Let us write down the position, and\nfinish another time.’\n\n‘No, please not,’ she implored. ‘I should not rest if I did not know the\nresult at once. It is your move.’\n\nTen minutes passed.\n\nShe started up suddenly. ‘I know what you are doing?’ she cried, an\nangry colour upon her cheeks, and her eyes indignant. ‘You were thinking\nof letting me win to please me!’\n\n‘I don’t mind owning that I was,’ Knight responded phlegmatically, and\nappearing all the more so by contrast with her own turmoil.\n\n‘But you must not! I won’t have it.’\n\n‘Very well.’\n\n‘No, that will not do; I insist that you promise not to do any such\nabsurd thing. It is insulting me!’\n\n‘Very well, madam. I won’t do any such absurd thing. You shall not win.’\n\n‘That is to be proved!’ she returned proudly; and the play went on.\n\nNothing is now heard but the ticking of a quaint old timepiece on the\nsummit of a bookcase. Ten minutes pass; he captures her knight; she\ntakes his knight, and looks a very Rhadamanthus.\n\nMore minutes tick away; she takes his pawn and has the advantage,\nshowing her sense of it rather prominently.\n\nFive minutes more: he takes her bishop: she brings things even by taking\nhis knight.\n\nThree minutes: she looks bold, and takes his queen: he looks placid, and\ntakes hers.\n\nEight or ten minutes pass: he takes a pawn; she utters a little pooh!\nbut not the ghost of a pawn can she take in retaliation.\n\nTen minutes pass: he takes another pawn and says, ‘Check!’ She flushes,\nextricates herself by capturing his bishop, and looks triumphant. He\nimmediately takes her bishop: she looks surprised.\n\nFive minutes longer: she makes a dash and takes his only remaining\nbishop; he replies by taking her only remaining knight.\n\nTwo minutes: he gives check; her mind is now in a painful state of\ntension, and she shades her face with her hand.\n\nYet a few minutes more: he takes her rook and checks again. She\nliterally trembles now lest an artful surprise she has in store for him\nshall be anticipated by the artful surprise he evidently has in store\nfor her.\n\nFive minutes: ‘Checkmate in two moves!’ exclaims Elfride.\n\n‘If you can,’ says Knight.\n\n‘Oh, I have miscalculated; that is cruel!’\n\n‘Checkmate,’ says Knight; and the victory is won.\n\nElfride arose and turned away without letting him see her face. Once in\nthe hall she ran upstairs and into her room, and flung herself down upon\nher bed, weeping bitterly.\n\n\n‘Where is Elfride?’ said her father at luncheon.\n\nKnight listened anxiously for the answer. He had been hoping to see her\nagain before this time.\n\n‘She isn’t well, sir,’ was the reply.\n\nMrs. Swancourt rose and left the room, going upstairs to Elfride’s\napartment.\n\nAt the door was Unity, who occupied in the new establishment a position\nbetween young lady’s maid and middle-housemaid.\n\n‘She is sound asleep, ma’am,’ Unity whispered.\n\nMrs. Swancourt opened the door. Elfride was lying full-dressed on the\nbed, her face hot and red, her arms thrown abroad. At intervals of a\nminute she tossed restlessly from side to side, and indistinctly moaned\nwords used in the game of chess.\n\nMrs. Swancourt had a turn for doctoring, and felt her pulse. It was\ntwanging like a harp-string, at the rate of nearly a hundred and fifty\na minute. Softly moving the sleeping girl to a little less cramped\nposition, she went downstairs again.\n\n‘She is asleep now,’ said Mrs. Swancourt. ‘She does not seem very well.\nCousin Knight, what were you thinking of? her tender brain won’t bear\ncudgelling like your great head. You should have strictly forbidden her\nto play again.’\n\nIn truth, the essayist’s experience of the nature of young women was\nfar less extensive than his abstract knowledge of them led himself and\nothers to believe. He could pack them into sentences like a workman, but\npractically was nowhere.\n\n‘I am indeed sorry,’ said Knight, feeling even more than he expressed.\n‘But surely, the young lady knows best what is good for her!’\n\n‘Bless you, that’s just what she doesn’t know. She never thinks of such\nthings, does she, Christopher? Her father and I have to command her and\nkeep her in order, as you would a child. She will say things worthy of a\nFrench epigrammatist, and act like a robin in a greenhouse. But I think\nwe will send for Dr. Granson--there can be no harm.’\n\nA man was straightway despatched on horseback to Castle Boterel, and the\ngentleman known as Dr. Granson came in the course of the afternoon.\nHe pronounced her nervous system to be in a decided state of disorder;\nforwarded some soothing draught, and gave orders that on no account\nwhatever was she to play chess again.\n\nThe next morning Knight, much vexed with himself, waited with a\ncuriously compounded feeling for her entry to breakfast. The women\nservants came in to prayers at irregular intervals, and as each entered,\nhe could not, to save his life, avoid turning his head with the hope\nthat she might be Elfride. Mr. Swancourt began reading without waiting\nfor her. Then somebody glided in noiselessly; Knight softly glanced up:\nit was only the little kitchen-maid. Knight thought reading prayers a\nbore.\n\nHe went out alone, and for almost the first time failed to recognize\nthat holding converse with Nature’s charms was not solitude. On nearing\nthe house again he perceived his young friend crossing a slope by a path\nwhich ran into the one he was following in the angle of the field. Here\nthey met. Elfride was at once exultant and abashed: coming into his\npresence had upon her the effect of entering a cathedral.\n\nKnight had his note-book in his hand, and had, in fact, been in the very\nact of writing therein when they came in view of each other. He left off\nin the midst of a sentence, and proceeded to inquire warmly concerning\nher state of health. She said she was perfectly well, and indeed had\nnever looked better. Her health was as inconsequent as her actions. Her\nlips were red, WITHOUT the polish that cherries have, and their redness\nmargined with the white skin in a clearly defined line, which had\nnothing of jagged confusion in it. Altogether she stood as the last\nperson in the world to be knocked over by a game of chess, because too\nephemeral-looking to play one.\n\n‘Are you taking notes?’ she inquired with an alacrity plainly arising\nless from interest in the subject than from a wish to divert his\nthoughts from herself.\n\n‘Yes; I was making an entry. And with your permission I will complete\nit.’ Knight then stood still and wrote. Elfride remained beside him a\nmoment, and afterwards walked on.\n\n‘I should like to see all the secrets that are in that book,’ she gaily\nflung back to him over her shoulder.\n\n‘I don’t think you would find much to interest you.’\n\n‘I know I should.’\n\n‘Then of course I have no more to say.’\n\n‘But I would ask this question first. Is it a book of mere facts\nconcerning journeys and expenditure, and so on, or a book of thoughts?’\n\n‘Well, to tell the truth, it is not exactly either. It consists for\nthe most part of jottings for articles and essays, disjointed and\ndisconnected, of no possible interest to anybody but myself.’\n\n‘It contains, I suppose, your developed thoughts in embryo?’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘If they are interesting when enlarged to the size of an article, what\nmust they be in their concentrated form? Pure rectified spirit, above\nproof; before it is lowered to be fit for human consumption: “words that\nburn” indeed.’\n\n‘Rather like a balloon before it is inflated: flabby, shapeless, dead.\nYou could hardly read them.’\n\n‘May I try?’ she said coaxingly. ‘I wrote my poor romance in that way--I\nmean in bits, out of doors--and I should like to see whether your way of\nentering things is the same as mine.’\n\n‘Really, that’s rather an awkward request. I suppose I can hardly refuse\nnow you have asked so directly; but----’\n\n‘You think me ill-mannered in asking. But does not this justify me--your\nwriting in my presence, Mr. Knight? If I had lighted upon your book by\nchance, it would have been different; but you stand before me, and say,\n“Excuse me,” without caring whether I do or not, and write on, and then\ntell me they are not private facts but public ideas.’\n\n‘Very well, Miss Swancourt. If you really must see, the consequences\nbe upon your own head. Remember, my advice to you is to leave my book\nalone.’\n\n‘But with that caution I have your permission?’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\nShe hesitated a moment, looked at his hand containing the book, then\nlaughed, and saying, ‘I must see it,’ withdrew it from his fingers.\n\nKnight rambled on towards the house, leaving her standing in the path\nturning over the leaves. By the time he had reached the wicket-gate he\nsaw that she had moved, and waited till she came up.\n\nElfride had closed the note-book, and was carrying it disdainfully by\nthe corner between her finger and thumb; her face wore a nettled look.\nShe silently extended the volume towards him, raising her eyes no higher\nthan her hand was lifted.\n\n‘Take it,’ said Elfride quickly. ‘I don’t want to read it.’\n\n‘Could you understand it?’ said Knight.\n\n‘As far as I looked. But I didn’t care to read much.’\n\n‘Why, Miss Swancourt?’\n\n‘Only because I didn’t wish to--that’s all.’\n\n‘I warned you that you might not.’\n\n‘Yes, but I never supposed you would have put me there.’\n\n‘Your name is not mentioned once within the four corners.’\n\n‘Not my name--I know that.’\n\n‘Nor your description, nor anything by which anybody would recognize\nyou.’\n\n‘Except myself. For what is this?’ she exclaimed, taking it from him and\nopening a page. ‘August 7. That’s the day before yesterday. But I won’t\nread it,’ Elfride said, closing the book again with pretty hauteur. ‘Why\nshould I? I had no business to ask to see your book, and it serves me\nright.’\n\nKnight hardly recollected what he had written, and turned over the book\nto see. He came to this:\n\n‘Aug. 7. Girl gets into her teens, and her self-consciousness is born.\nAfter a certain interval passed in infantine helplessness it begins to\nact. Simple, young, and inexperienced at first. Persons of observation\ncan tell to a nicety how old this consciousness is by the skill it has\nacquired in the art necessary to its success--the art of hiding\nitself. Generally begins career by actions which are popularly termed\nshowing-off. Method adopted depends in each case upon the disposition,\nrank, residence, of the young lady attempting it. Town-bred girl will\nutter some moral paradox on fast men, or love. Country miss adopts the\nmore material media of taking a ghastly fence, whistling, or making your\nblood run cold by appearing to risk her neck. (MEM. On Endelstow Tower.)\n\n‘An innocent vanity is of course the origin of these displays. “Look\nat me,” say these youthful beginners in womanly artifice, without\nreflecting whether or not it be to their advantage to show so very much\nof themselves. (Amplify and correct for paper on Artless Arts.)’\n\n‘Yes, I remember now,’ said Knight. ‘The notes were certainly suggested\nby your manoeuvre on the church tower. But you must not think too much\nof such random observations,’ he continued encouragingly, as he noticed\nher injured looks. ‘A mere fancy passing through my head assumes a\nfactitious importance to you, because it has been made permanent by\nbeing written down. All mankind think thoughts as bad as those of people\nthey most love on earth, but such thoughts never getting embodied on\npaper, it becomes assumed that they never existed. I daresay that you\nyourself have thought some disagreeable thing or other of me, which\nwould seem just as bad as this if written. I challenge you, now, to tell\nme.’\n\n‘The worst thing I have thought of you?’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘I must not.’\n\n‘Oh yes.’\n\n‘I thought you were rather round-shouldered.’\n\nKnight looked slightly redder.\n\n‘And that there was a little bald spot on the top of your head.’\n\n‘Heh-heh! Two ineradicable defects,’ said Knight, there being a faint\nghastliness discernible in his laugh. ‘They are much worse in a lady’s\neye than being thought self-conscious, I suppose.’\n\n‘Ah, that’s very fine,’ she said, too inexperienced to perceive her hit,\nand hence not quite disposed to forgive his notes. ‘You alluded to me in\nthat entry as if I were such a child, too. Everybody does that. I cannot\nunderstand it. I am quite a woman, you know. How old do you think I am?’\n\n‘How old? Why, seventeen, I should say. All girls are seventeen.’\n\n‘You are wrong. I am nearly nineteen. Which class of women do you like\nbest, those who seem younger, or those who seem older than they are?’\n\n‘Off-hand I should be inclined to say those who seem older.’\n\nSo it was not Elfride’s class.\n\n‘But it is well known,’ she said eagerly, and there was something\ntouching in the artless anxiety to be thought much of which she revealed\nby her words, ‘that the slower a nature is to develop, the richer the\nnature. Youths and girls who are men and women before they come of age\nare nobodies by the time that backward people have shown their full\ncompass.’\n\n‘Yes,’ said Knight thoughtfully. ‘There is really something in that\nremark. But at the risk of offence I must remind you that you there take\nit for granted that the woman behind her time at a given age has not\nreached the end of her tether. Her backwardness may be not because she\nis slow to develop, but because she soon exhausted her capacity for\ndeveloping.’\n\nElfride looked disappointed. By this time they were indoors. Mrs.\nSwancourt, to whom match-making by any honest means was meat and\ndrink, had now a little scheme of that nature concerning this pair. The\nmorning-room, in which they both expected to find her, was empty; the\nold lady having, for the above reason, vacated it by the second door as\nthey entered by the first.\n\nKnight went to the chimney-piece, and carelessly surveyed two portraits\non ivory.\n\n‘Though these pink ladies had very rudimentary features, judging by what\nI see here,’ he observed, ‘they had unquestionably beautiful heads of\nhair.’\n\n‘Yes; and that is everything,’ said Elfride, possibly conscious of her\nown, possibly not.\n\n‘Not everything; though a great deal, certainly.’\n\n‘Which colour do you like best?’ she ventured to ask.\n\n‘More depends on its abundance than on its colour.’\n\n‘Abundances being equal, may I inquire your favourite colour?’\n\n‘Dark.’\n\n‘I mean for women,’ she said, with the minutest fall of countenance, and\na hope that she had been misunderstood.\n\n‘So do I,’ Knight replied.\n\nIt was impossible for any man not to know the colour of Elfride’s hair.\nIn women who wear it plainly such a feature may be overlooked by men not\ngiven to ocular intentness. But hers was always in the way. You saw her\nhair as far as you could see her sex, and knew that it was the palest\nbrown. She knew instantly that Knight, being perfectly aware of this,\nhad an independent standard of admiration in the matter.\n\nElfride was thoroughly vexed. She could not but be struck with the\nhonesty of his opinions, and the worst of it was, that the more they\nwent against her, the more she respected them. And now, like a reckless\ngambler, she hazarded her last and best treasure. Her eyes: they were\nher all now.\n\n‘What coloured eyes do you like best, Mr. Knight?’ she said slowly.\n\n‘Honestly, or as a compliment?’\n\n‘Of course honestly; I don’t want anybody’s compliment!’\n\nAnd yet Elfride knew otherwise: that a compliment or word of approval\nfrom that man then would have been like a well to a famished Arab.\n\n‘I prefer hazel,’ he said serenely.\n\nShe had played and lost again.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIX\n\n     ‘Love was in the next degree.’\n\n\nKnight had none of those light familiarities of speech which, by\njudicious touches of epigrammatic flattery, obliterate a woman’s\nrecollection of the speaker’s abstract opinions. So no more was said by\neither on the subject of hair, eyes, or development. Elfride’s mind\nhad been impregnated with sentiments of her own smallness to an\nuncomfortable degree of distinctness, and her discomfort was visible in\nher face. The whole tendency of the conversation latterly had been to\nquietly but surely disparage her; and she was fain to take Stephen into\nfavour in self-defence. He would not have been so unloving, she said,\nas to admire an idiosyncrasy and features different from her own. True,\nStephen had declared he loved her: Mr. Knight had never done anything\nof the sort. Somehow this did not mend matters, and the sensation of\nher smallness in Knight’s eyes still remained. Had the position been\nreversed--had Stephen loved her in spite of a differing taste, and had\nKnight been indifferent in spite of her resemblance to his ideal, it\nwould have engendered far happier thoughts. As matters stood, Stephen’s\nadmiration might have its root in a blindness the result of passion.\nPerhaps any keen man’s judgment was condemnatory of her.\n\nDuring the remainder of Saturday they were more or less thrown with\ntheir seniors, and no conversation arose which was exclusively their\nown. When Elfride was in bed that night her thoughts recurred to the\nsame subject. At one moment she insisted that it was ill-natured of him\nto speak so decisively as he had done; the next, that it was sterling\nhonesty.\n\n‘Ah, what a poor nobody I am!’ she said, sighing. ‘People like him, who\ngo about the great world, don’t care in the least what I am like either\nin mood or feature.’\n\nPerhaps a man who has got thoroughly into a woman’s mind in this manner,\nis half way to her heart; the distance between those two stations is\nproverbially short.\n\n‘And are you really going away this week?’ said Mrs. Swancourt to Knight\non the following evening, which was Sunday.\n\nThey were all leisurely climbing the hill to the church, where a last\nservice was now to be held at the rather exceptional time of evening\ninstead of in the afternoon, previous to the demolition of the ruinous\nportions.\n\n‘I am intending to cross to Cork from Bristol,’ returned Knight; ‘and\nthen I go on to Dublin.’\n\n‘Return this way, and stay a little longer with us,’ said the vicar. ‘A\nweek is nothing. We have hardly been able to realize your presence yet.\nI remember a story which----’\n\nThe vicar suddenly stopped. He had forgotten it was Sunday, and would\nprobably have gone on in his week-day mode of thought had not a turn in\nthe breeze blown the skirt of his college gown within the range of his\nvision, and so reminded him. He at once diverted the current of his\nnarrative with the dexterity the occasion demanded.\n\n‘The story of the Levite who journeyed to Bethlehem-judah, from which\nI took my text the Sunday before last, is quite to the point,’ he\ncontinued, with the pronunciation of a man who, far from having intended\nto tell a week-day story a moment earlier, had thought of nothing but\nSabbath matters for several weeks. ‘What did he gain after all by his\nrestlessness? Had he remained in the city of the Jebusites, and not been\nso anxious for Gibeah, none of his troubles would have arisen.’\n\n‘But he had wasted five days already,’ said Knight, closing his eyes\nto the vicar’s commendable diversion. ‘His fault lay in beginning the\ntarrying system originally.’\n\n‘True, true; my illustration fails.’\n\n‘But not the hospitality which prompted the story.’\n\n‘So you are to come just the same,’ urged Mrs. Swancourt, for she had\nseen an almost imperceptible fall of countenance in her stepdaughter at\nKnight’s announcement.\n\nKnight half promised to call on his return journey; but the uncertainty\nwith which he spoke was quite enough to fill Elfride with a regretful\ninterest in all he did during the few remaining hours. The curate having\nalready officiated twice that day in the two churches, Mr. Swancourt had\nundertaken the whole of the evening service, and Knight read the lessons\nfor him. The sun streamed across from the dilapidated west window, and\nlighted all the assembled worshippers with a golden glow, Knight as he\nread being illuminated by the same mellow lustre. Elfride at the organ\nregarded him with a throbbing sadness of mood which was fed by a sense\nof being far removed from his sphere. As he went deliberately through\nthe chapter appointed--a portion of the history of Elijah--and ascended\nthat magnificent climax of the wind, the earthquake, the fire, and\nthe still small voice, his deep tones echoed past with such apparent\ndisregard of her existence, that his presence inspired her with a\nforlorn sense of unapproachableness, which his absence would hardly have\nbeen able to cause.\n\nAt the same time, turning her face for a moment to catch the glory of\nthe dying sun as it fell on his form, her eyes were arrested by the\nshape and aspect of a woman in the west gallery. It was the bleak barren\ncountenance of the widow Jethway, whom Elfride had not seen much of\nsince the morning of her return with Stephen Smith. Possessing the\nsmallest of competencies, this unhappy woman appeared to spend her life\nin journeyings between Endelstow Churchyard and that of a village near\nSouthampton, where her father and mother were laid.\n\nShe had not attended the service here for a considerable time, and she\nnow seemed to have a reason for her choice of seat. From the gallery\nwindow the tomb of her son was plainly visible--standing as the nearest\nobject in a prospect which was closed outwardly by the changeless\nhorizon of the sea.\n\nThe streaming rays, too, flooded her face, now bent towards Elfride with\na hard and bitter expression that the solemnity of the place raised to\na tragic dignity it did not intrinsically possess. The girl resumed her\nnormal attitude with an added disquiet.\n\nElfride’s emotion was cumulative, and after a while would assert itself\non a sudden. A slight touch was enough to set it free--a poem, a sunset,\na cunningly contrived chord of music, a vague imagining, being the usual\naccidents of its exhibition. The longing for Knight’s respect, which\nwas leading up to an incipient yearning for his love, made the present\nconjuncture a sufficient one. Whilst kneeling down previous to leaving,\nwhen the sunny streaks had gone upward to the roof, and the lower\npart of the church was in soft shadow, she could not help thinking\nof Coleridge’s morbid poem ‘The Three Graves,’ and shuddering as she\nwondered if Mrs. Jethway were cursing her, she wept as if her heart\nwould break.\n\nThey came out of church just as the sun went down, leaving the landscape\nlike a platform from which an eloquent speaker has retired, and nothing\nremains for the audience to do but to rise and go home. Mr. and Mrs.\nSwancourt went off in the carriage, Knight and Elfride preferring to\nwalk, as the skilful old matchmaker had imagined. They descended the\nhill together.\n\n‘I liked your reading, Mr. Knight,’ Elfride presently found herself\nsaying. ‘You read better than papa.’\n\n‘I will praise anybody that will praise me. You played excellently, Miss\nSwancourt, and very correctly.’\n\n‘Correctly--yes.’\n\n‘It must be a great pleasure to you to take an active part in the\nservice.’\n\n‘I want to be able to play with more feeling. But I have not a good\nselection of music, sacred or secular. I wish I had a nice little\nmusic-library--well chosen, and that the only new pieces sent me were\nthose of genuine merit.’\n\n‘I am glad to hear such a wish from you. It is extraordinary how many\nwomen have no honest love of music as an end and not as a means, even\nleaving out those who have nothing in them. They mostly like it for its\naccessories. I have never met a woman who loves music as do ten or a\ndozen men I know.’\n\n‘How would you draw the line between women with something and women with\nnothing in them?’\n\n‘Well,’ said Knight, reflecting a moment, ‘I mean by nothing in them\nthose who don’t care about anything solid. This is an instance: I knew a\nman who had a young friend in whom he was much interested; in fact, they\nwere going to be married. She was seemingly poetical, and he offered her\na choice of two editions of the British poets, which she pretended to\nwant badly. He said, “Which of them would you like best for me to send?”\n She said, “A pair of the prettiest earrings in Bond Street, if you don’t\nmind, would be nicer than either.” Now I call her a girl with not much\nin her but vanity; and so do you, I daresay.’\n\n‘Oh yes,’ replied Elfride with an effort.\n\nHappening to catch a glimpse of her face as she was speaking, and\nnoticing that her attempt at heartiness was a miserable failure, he\nappeared to have misgivings.\n\n‘You, Miss Swancourt, would not, under such circumstances, have\npreferred the nicknacks?’\n\n‘No, I don’t think I should, indeed,’ she stammered.\n\n‘I’ll put it to you,’ said the inflexible Knight. ‘Which will you have\nof these two things of about equal value--the well-chosen little library\nof the best music you spoke of--bound in morocco, walnut case, lock and\nkey--or a pair of the very prettiest earrings in Bond Street windows?’\n\n‘Of course the music,’ Elfride replied with forced earnestness.\n\n‘You are quite certain?’ he said emphatically.\n\n‘Quite,’ she faltered; ‘if I could for certain buy the earrings\nafterwards.’\n\nKnight, somewhat blamably, keenly enjoyed sparring with the palpitating\nmobile creature, whose excitable nature made any such thing a species of\ncruelty.\n\nHe looked at her rather oddly, and said, ‘Fie!’\n\n‘Forgive me,’ she said, laughing a little, a little frightened, and\nblushing very deeply.\n\n‘Ah, Miss Elfie, why didn’t you say at first, as any firm woman would\nhave said, I am as bad as she, and shall choose the same?’\n\n‘I don’t know,’ said Elfride wofully, and with a distressful smile.\n\n‘I thought you were exceptionally musical?’\n\n‘So I am, I think. But the test is so severe--quite painful.’\n\n‘I don’t understand.’\n\n‘Music doesn’t do any real good, or rather----’\n\n‘That IS a thing to say, Miss Swancourt! Why, what----’\n\n‘You don’t understand! you don’t understand!’\n\n‘Why, what conceivable use is there in jimcrack jewellery?’\n\n‘No, no, no, no!’ she cried petulantly; ‘I didn’t mean what you think. I\nlike the music best, only I like----’\n\n‘Earrings better--own it!’ he said in a teasing tone. ‘Well, I think I\nshould have had the moral courage to own it at once, without pretending\nto an elevation I could not reach.’\n\nLike the French soldiery, Elfride was not brave when on the defensive.\nSo it was almost with tears in her eyes that she answered desperately:\n\n‘My meaning is, that I like earrings best just now, because I lost one\nof my prettiest pair last year, and papa said he would not buy any more,\nor allow me to myself, because I was careless; and now I wish I had some\nlike them--that’s what my meaning is--indeed it is, Mr. Knight.’\n\n‘I am afraid I have been very harsh and rude,’ said Knight, with a look\nof regret at seeing how disturbed she was. ‘But seriously, if women only\nknew how they ruin their good looks by such appurtenances, I am sure\nthey would never want them.’\n\n‘They were lovely, and became me so!’\n\n‘Not if they were like the ordinary hideous things women stuff their\nears with nowadays--like the governor of a steam-engine, or a pair\nof scales, or gold gibbets and chains, and artists’ palettes, and\ncompensation pendulums, and Heaven knows what besides.’\n\n‘No; they were not one of those things. So pretty--like this,’ she said\nwith eager animation. And she drew with the point of her parasol an\nenlarged view of one of the lamented darlings, to a scale that would\nhave suited a giantess half-a-mile high.\n\n‘Yes, very pretty--very,’ said Knight dryly. ‘How did you come to lose\nsuch a precious pair of articles?’\n\n‘I only lost one--nobody ever loses both at the same time.’\n\nShe made this remark with embarrassment, and a nervous movement of\nthe fingers. Seeing that the loss occurred whilst Stephen Smith was\nattempting to kiss her for the first time on the cliff, her confusion\nwas hardly to be wondered at. The question had been awkward, and\nreceived no direct answer.\n\nKnight seemed not to notice her manner.\n\n‘Oh, nobody ever loses both--I see. And certainly the fact that it was a\ncase of loss takes away all odour of vanity from your choice.’\n\n‘As I never know whether you are in earnest, I don’t now,’ she said,\nlooking up inquiringly at the hairy face of the oracle. And coming\ngallantly to her own rescue, ‘If I really seem vain, it is that I am\nonly vain in my ways--not in my heart. The worst women are those vain in\ntheir hearts, and not in their ways.’\n\n‘An adroit distinction. Well, they are certainly the more objectionable\nof the two,’ said Knight.\n\n‘Is vanity a mortal or a venial sin? You know what life is: tell me.’\n\n‘I am very far from knowing what life is. A just conception of life is\ntoo large a thing to grasp during the short interval of passing through\nit.’\n\n‘Will the fact of a woman being fond of jewellery be likely to make her\nlife, in its higher sense, a failure?’\n\n‘Nobody’s life is altogether a failure.’\n\n‘Well, you know what I mean, even though my words are badly selected and\ncommonplace,’ she said impatiently. ‘Because I utter commonplace words,\nyou must not suppose I think only commonplace thoughts. My poor stock\nof words are like a limited number of rough moulds I have to cast all my\nmaterials in, good and bad; and the novelty or delicacy of the substance\nis often lost in the coarse triteness of the form.’\n\n‘Very well; I’ll believe that ingenious representation. As to the\nsubject in hand--lives which are failures--you need not trouble\nyourself. Anybody’s life may be just as romantic and strange and\ninteresting if he or she fails as if he or she succeed. All the\ndifference is, that the last chapter is wanting in the story. If a man\nof power tries to do a great deed, and just falls short of it by an\naccident not his fault, up to that time his history had as much in it as\nthat of a great man who has done his great deed. It is whimsical of the\nworld to hold that particulars of how a lad went to school and so on\nshould be as an interesting romance or as nothing to them, precisely in\nproportion to his after renown.’\n\nThey were walking between the sunset and the moonrise. With the dropping\nof the sun a nearly full moon had begun to raise itself. Their shadows,\nas cast by the western glare, showed signs of becoming obliterated in\nthe interest of a rival pair in the opposite direction which the moon\nwas bringing to distinctness.\n\n‘I consider my life to some extent a failure,’ said Knight again after a\npause, during which he had noticed the antagonistic shadows.\n\n‘You! How?’\n\n‘I don’t precisely know. But in some way I have missed the mark.’\n\n‘Really? To have done it is not much to be sad about, but to feel that\nyou have done it must be a cause of sorrow. Am I right?’\n\n‘Partly, though not quite. For a sensation of being profoundly\nexperienced serves as a sort of consolation to people who are conscious\nof having taken wrong turnings. Contradictory as it seems, there is\nnothing truer than that people who have always gone right don’t know\nhalf as much about the nature and ways of going right as those do who\nhave gone wrong. However, it is not desirable for me to chill your\nsummer-time by going into this.’\n\n‘You have not told me even now if I am really vain.’\n\n‘If I say Yes, I shall offend you; if I say No, you’ll think I don’t\nmean it,’ he replied, looking curiously into her face.\n\n‘Ah, well,’ she replied, with a little breath of distress, ‘“That which\nis exceeding deep, who will find it out?” I suppose I must take you as I\ndo the Bible--find out and understand all I can; and on the strength of\nthat, swallow the rest in a lump, by simple faith. Think me vain, if you\nwill. Worldly greatness requires so much littleness to grow up in, that\nan infirmity more or less is not a matter for regret.’\n\n‘As regards women, I can’t say,’ answered Knight carelessly; ‘but it is\nwithout doubt a misfortune for a man who has a living to get, to be born\nof a truly noble nature. A high soul will bring a man to the workhouse;\nso you may be right in sticking up for vanity.’\n\n‘No, no, I don’t do that,’ she said regretfully.\n\nMr. Knight, when you are gone, will you send me something you have\nwritten? I think I should like to see whether you write as you have\nlately spoken, or in your better mood. Which is your true self--the\ncynic you have been this evening, or the nice philosopher you were up to\nto-night?’\n\n‘Ah, which? You know as well as I.’\n\nTheir conversation detained them on the lawn and in the portico till the\nstars blinked out. Elfride flung back her head, and said idly--\n\n‘There’s a bright star exactly over me.’\n\n‘Each bright star is overhead somewhere.’\n\n‘Is it? Oh yes, of course. Where is that one?’ and she pointed with her\nfinger.\n\n‘That is poised like a white hawk over one of the Cape Verde Islands.’\n\n‘And that?’\n\n‘Looking down upon the source of the Nile.’\n\n‘And that lonely quiet-looking one?’\n\n‘He watches the North Pole, and has no less than the whole equator for\nhis horizon. And that idle one low down upon the ground, that we have\nalmost rolled away from, is in India--over the head of a young friend of\nmine, who very possibly looks at the star in our zenith, as it hangs\nlow upon his horizon, and thinks of it as marking where his true love\ndwells.’\n\nElfride glanced at Knight with misgiving. Did he mean her? She could not\nsee his features; but his attitude seemed to show unconsciousness.\n\n‘The star is over MY head,’ she said with hesitation.\n\n‘Or anybody else’s in England.’\n\n‘Oh yes, I see:’ she breathed her relief.\n\n‘His parents, I believe, are natives of this county. I don’t know\nthem, though I have been in correspondence with him for many years till\nlately. Fortunately or unfortunately for him he fell in love, and then\nwent to Bombay. Since that time I have heard very little of him.’\n\nKnight went no further in his volunteered statement, and though Elfride\nat one moment was inclined to profit by the lessons in honesty he had\njust been giving her, the flesh was weak, and the intention dispersed\ninto silence. There seemed a reproach in Knight’s blind words, and yet\nshe was not able to clearly define any disloyalty that she had been\nguilty of.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XX\n\n     ‘A distant dearness in the hill.’\n\n\nKnight turned his back upon the parish of Endelstow, and crossed over to\nCork.\n\nOne day of absence superimposed itself on another, and proportionately\nweighted his heart. He pushed on to the Lakes of Killarney, rambled amid\ntheir luxuriant woods, surveyed the infinite variety of island, hill,\nand dale there to be found, listened to the marvellous echoes of that\nromantic spot; but altogether missed the glory and the dream he formerly\nfound in such favoured regions.\n\nWhilst in the company of Elfride, her girlish presence had not\nperceptibly affected him to any depth. He had not been conscious that\nher entry into his sphere had added anything to himself; but now\nthat she was taken away he was very conscious of a great deal being\nabstracted. The superfluity had become a necessity, and Knight was in\nlove.\n\nStephen fell in love with Elfride by looking at her: Knight by ceasing\nto do so. When or how the spirit entered into him he knew not: certain\nhe was that when on the point of leaving Endelstow he had felt none of\nthat exquisite nicety of poignant sadness natural to such severances,\nseeing how delightful a subject of contemplation Elfride had been ever\nsince. Had he begun to love her when she met his eye after her mishap\non the tower? He had simply thought her weak. Had he grown to love her\nwhilst standing on the lawn brightened all over by the evening sun? He\nhad thought her complexion good: no more. Was it her conversation\nthat had sown the seed? He had thought her words ingenious, and very\ncreditable to a young woman, but not noteworthy. Had the chess-playing\nanything to do with it? Certainly not: he had thought her at that time a\nrather conceited child.\n\nKnight’s experience was a complete disproof of the assumption that\nlove always comes by glances of the eye and sympathetic touches of the\nfingers: that, like flame, it makes itself palpable at the moment of\ngeneration. Not till they were parted, and she had become sublimated in\nhis memory, could he be said to have even attentively regarded her.\n\nThus, having passively gathered up images of her which his mind did not\nact upon till the cause of them was no longer before him, he appeared\nto himself to have fallen in love with her soul, which had temporarily\nassumed its disembodiment to accompany him on his way.\n\nShe began to rule him so imperiously now that, accustomed to analysis,\nhe almost trembled at the possible result of the introduction of this\nnew force among the nicely adjusted ones of his ordinary life. He became\nrestless: then he forgot all collateral subjects in the pleasure of\nthinking about her.\n\nYet it must be said that Knight loved philosophically rather than with\nromance.\n\nHe thought of her manner towards him. Simplicity verges on coquetry. Was\nshe flirting? he said to himself. No forcible translation of favour into\nsuspicion was able to uphold such a theory. The performance had been\ntoo well done to be anything but real. It had the defects without which\nnothing is genuine. No actress of twenty years’ standing, no bald-necked\nlady whose earliest season ‘out’ was lost in the discreet mist of\nevasive talk, could have played before him the part of ingenuous girl\nas Elfride lived it. She had the little artful ways which partly make up\ningenuousness.\n\nThere are bachelors by nature and bachelors by circumstance: spinsters\nthere doubtless are also of both kinds, though some think only those\nof the latter. However, Knight had been looked upon as a bachelor by\nnature. What was he coming to? It was very odd to himself to look at his\ntheories on the subject of love, and reading them now by the full light\nof a new experience, to see how much more his sentences meant than he\nhad felt them to mean when they were written. People often discover the\nreal force of a trite old maxim only when it is thrust upon them by a\nchance adventure; but Knight had never before known the case of a man\nwho learnt the full compass of his own epigrams by such means.\n\nHe was intensely satisfied with one aspect of the affair. Inbred in him\nwas an invincible objection to be any but the first comer in a woman’s\nheart. He had discovered within himself the condition that if ever\nhe did make up his mind to marry, it must be on the certainty that\nno cropping out of inconvenient old letters, no bow and blush to\na mysterious stranger casually met, should be a possible source of\ndiscomposure. Knight’s sentiments were only the ordinary ones of a man\nof his age who loves genuinely, perhaps exaggerated a little by his\npursuits. When men first love as lads, it is with the very centre of\ntheir hearts, nothing else being concerned in the operation. With added\nyears, more of the faculties attempt a partnership in the passion, till\nat Knight’s age the understanding is fain to have a hand in it. It may\nas well be left out. A man in love setting up his brains as a gauge of\nhis position is as one determining a ship’s longitude from a light at\nthe mast-head.\n\nKnight argued from Elfride’s unwontedness of manner, which was matter\nof fact, to an unwontedness in love, which was matter of inference only.\nIncredules les plus credules. ‘Elfride,’ he said, ‘had hardly looked\nupon a man till she saw me.’\n\nHe had never forgotten his severity to her because she preferred\nornament to edification, and had since excused her a hundred times\nby thinking how natural to womankind was a love of adornment, and how\nnecessary became a mild infusion of personal vanity to complete the\ndelicate and fascinating dye of the feminine mind. So at the end of the\nweek’s absence, which had brought him as far as Dublin, he resolved to\ncurtail his tour, return to Endelstow, and commit himself by making a\nreality of the hypothetical offer of that Sunday evening.\n\nNotwithstanding that he had concocted a great deal of paper theory on\nsocial amenities and modern manners generally, the special ounce of\npractice was wanting, and now for his life Knight could not recollect\nwhether it was considered correct to give a young lady personal\nornaments before a regular engagement to marry had been initiated.\nBut the day before leaving Dublin he looked around anxiously for a\nhigh-class jewellery establishment, in which he purchased what he\nconsidered would suit her best.\n\nIt was with a most awkward and unwonted feeling that after entering and\nclosing the door of his room he sat down, opened the morocco case, and\nheld up each of the fragile bits of gold-work before his eyes. Many\nthings had become old to the solitary man of letters, but these were\nnew, and he handled like a child an outcome of civilization which had\nnever before been touched by his fingers. A sudden fastidious decision\nthat the pattern chosen would not suit her after all caused him to rise\nin a flurry and tear down the street to change them for others. After\na great deal of trouble in reselecting, during which his mind became so\nbewildered that the critical faculty on objects of art seemed to have\nvacated his person altogether, Knight carried off another pair of\near-rings. These remained in his possession till the afternoon, when,\nafter contemplating them fifty times with a growing misgiving that the\nlast choice was worse than the first, he felt that no sleep would visit\nhis pillow till he had improved upon his previous purchases yet again.\nIn a perfect heat of vexation with himself for such tergiversation, he\nwent anew to the shop-door, was absolutely ashamed to enter and give\nfurther trouble, went to another shop, bought a pair at an enormously\nincreased price, because they seemed the very thing, asked the\ngoldsmiths if they would take the other pair in exchange, was told that\nthey could not exchange articles bought of another maker, paid down the\nmoney, and went off with the two pairs in his possession, wondering what\non earth to do with the superfluous pair. He almost wished he could\nlose them, or that somebody would steal them, and was burdened with an\ninterposing sense that, as a capable man, with true ideas of economy,\nhe must necessarily sell them somewhere, which he did at last for a mere\nsong. Mingled with a blank feeling of a whole day being lost to him in\nrunning about the city on this new and extraordinary class of errand,\nand of several pounds being lost through his bungling, was a slight\nsense of satisfaction that he had emerged for ever from his antediluvian\nignorance on the subject of ladies’ jewellery, as well as secured a\ntruly artistic production at last. During the remainder of that day\nhe scanned the ornaments of every lady he met with the profoundly\nexperienced eye of an appraiser.\n\nNext morning Knight was again crossing St. George’s Channel--not\nreturning to London by the Holyhead route as he had originally intended,\nbut towards Bristol--availing himself of Mr. and Mrs. Swancourt’s\ninvitation to revisit them on his homeward journey.\n\nWe flit forward to Elfride.\n\nWoman’s ruling passion--to fascinate and influence those more powerful\nthan she--though operant in Elfride, was decidedly purposeless. She had\nwanted her friend Knight’s good opinion from the first: how much more\nthan that elementary ingredient of friendship she now desired, her fears\nwould hardly allow her to think. In originally wishing to please\nthe highest class of man she had ever intimately known, there was no\ndisloyalty to Stephen Smith. She could not--and few women can--realize\nthe possible vastness of an issue which has only an insignificant\nbegetting.\n\nHer letters from Stephen were necessarily few, and her sense of fidelity\nclung to the last she had received as a wrecked mariner clings to\nflotsam. The young girl persuaded herself that she was glad Stephen\nhad such a right to her hand as he had acquired (in her eyes) by the\nelopement. She beguiled herself by saying, ‘Perhaps if I had not so\ncommitted myself I might fall in love with Mr. Knight.’\n\nAll this made the week of Knight’s absence very gloomy and distasteful\nto her. She retained Stephen in her prayers, and his old letters were\nre-read--as a medicine in reality, though she deceived herself into the\nbelief that it was as a pleasure.\n\nThese letters had grown more and more hopeful. He told her that he\nfinished his work every day with a pleasant consciousness of having\nremoved one more stone from the barrier which divided them. Then he drew\nimages of what a fine figure they two would cut some day. People would\nturn their heads and say, ‘What a prize he has won!’ She was not to be\nsad about that wild runaway attempt of theirs (Elfride had repeatedly\nsaid that it grieved her). Whatever any other person who knew of it\nmight think, he knew well enough the modesty of her nature. The only\nreproach was a gentle one for not having written quite so devotedly\nduring her visit to London. Her letter had seemed to have a liveliness\nderived from other thoughts than thoughts of him.\n\n\nKnight’s intention of an early return to Endelstow having originally\nbeen faint, his promise to do so had been fainter. He was a man who kept\nhis words well to the rear of his possible actions. The vicar was rather\nsurprised to see him again so soon: Mrs. Swancourt was not. Knight\nfound, on meeting them all, after his arrival had been announced, that\nthey had formed an intention to go to St. Leonards for a few days at the\nend of the month.\n\nNo satisfactory conjuncture offered itself on this first evening of his\nreturn for presenting Elfride with what he had been at such pains to\nprocure. He was fastidious in his reading of opportunities for such an\nintended act. The next morning chancing to break fine after a week of\ncloudy weather, it was proposed and decided that they should all drive\nto Barwith Strand, a local lion which neither Mrs. Swancourt nor Knight\nhad seen. Knight scented romantic occasions from afar, and foresaw that\nsuch a one might be expected before the coming night.\n\nThe journey was along a road by neutral green hills, upon which\nhedgerows lay trailing like ropes on a quay. Gaps in these uplands\nrevealed the blue sea, flecked with a few dashes of white and a solitary\nwhite sail, the whole brimming up to a keen horizon which lay like a\nline ruled from hillside to hillside. Then they rolled down a pass, the\nchocolate-toned rocks forming a wall on both sides, from one of which\nfell a heavy jagged shade over half the roadway. A spout of fresh water\nburst from an occasional crevice, and pattering down upon broad green\nleaves, ran along as a rivulet at the bottom. Unkempt locks of heather\noverhung the brow of each steep, whence at divers points a bramble swung\nforth into mid-air, snatching at their head-dresses like a claw.\n\nThey mounted the last crest, and the bay which was to be the end of\ntheir pilgrimage burst upon them. The ocean blueness deepened its colour\nas it stretched to the foot of the crags, where it terminated in a\nfringe of white--silent at this distance, though moving and heaving\nlike a counterpane upon a restless sleeper. The shadowed hollows of the\npurple and brown rocks would have been called blue had not that tint\nbeen so entirely appropriated by the water beside them.\n\nThe carriage was put up at a little cottage with a shed attached, and\nan ostler and the coachman carried the hamper of provisions down to the\nshore.\n\nKnight found his opportunity. ‘I did not forget your wish,’ he began,\nwhen they were apart from their friends.\n\nElfride looked as if she did not understand.\n\n‘And I have brought you these,’ he continued, awkwardly pulling out the\ncase, and opening it while holding it towards her.\n\n‘O Mr. Knight!’ said Elfride confusedly, and turning to a lively red; ‘I\ndidn’t know you had any intention or meaning in what you said. I thought\nit a mere supposition. I don’t want them.’\n\nA thought which had flashed into her mind gave the reply a greater\ndecisiveness than it might otherwise have possessed. To-morrow was the\nday for Stephen’s letter.\n\n‘But will you not accept them?’ Knight returned, feeling less her master\nthan heretofore.\n\n‘I would rather not. They are beautiful--more beautiful than any I\nhave ever seen,’ she answered earnestly, looking half-wishfully at the\ntemptation, as Eve may have looked at the apple. ‘But I don’t want to\nhave them, if you will kindly forgive me, Mr. Knight.’\n\n‘No kindness at all,’ said Mr. Knight, brought to a full stop at this\nunexpected turn of events.\n\nA silence followed. Knight held the open case, looking rather wofully\nat the glittering forms he had forsaken his orbit to procure; turning it\nabout and holding it up as if, feeling his gift to be slighted by her,\nhe were endeavouring to admire it very much himself.\n\n‘Shut them up, and don’t let me see them any longer--do!’ she said\nlaughingly, and with a quaint mixture of reluctance and entreaty.\n\n‘Why, Elfie?’\n\n‘Not Elfie to you, Mr. Knight. Oh, because I shall want them. There,\nI am silly, I know, to say that! But I have a reason for not taking\nthem--now.’ She kept in the last word for a moment, intending to imply\nthat her refusal was finite, but somehow the word slipped out, and undid\nall the rest.\n\n‘You will take them some day?’\n\n‘I don’t want to.’\n\n‘Why don’t you want to, Elfride Swancourt?’\n\n‘Because I don’t. I don’t like to take them.’\n\n‘I have read a fact of distressing significance in that,’ said Knight.\n‘Since you like them, your dislike to having them must be towards me?’\n\n‘No, it isn’t.’\n\n‘What, then? Do you like me?’\n\nElfride deepened in tint, and looked into the distance with features\nshaped to an expression of the nicest criticism as regarded her answer.\n\n‘I like you pretty well,’ she at length murmured mildly.\n\n‘Not very much?’\n\n‘You are so sharp with me, and say hard things, and so how can I?’ she\nreplied evasively.\n\n‘You think me a fogey, I suppose?’\n\n‘No, I don’t--I mean I do--I don’t know what I think you, I mean. Let us\ngo to papa,’ responded Elfride, with somewhat of a flurried delivery.\n\n‘Well, I’ll tell you my object in getting the present,’ said Knight,\nwith a composure intended to remove from her mind any possible\nimpression of his being what he was--her lover. ‘You see it was the very\nleast I could do in common civility.’\n\nElfride felt rather blank at this lucid statement.\n\nKnight continued, putting away the case: ‘I felt as anybody naturally\nwould have, you know, that my words on your choice the other day were\ninvidious and unfair, and thought an apology should take a practical\nshape.’\n\n‘Oh yes.’\n\nElfride was sorry--she could not tell why--that he gave such a\nlegitimate reason. It was a disappointment that he had all the time a\ncool motive, which might be stated to anybody without raising a smile.\nHad she known they were offered in that spirit, she would certainly\nhave accepted the seductive gift. And the tantalizing feature was that\nperhaps he suspected her to imagine them offered as a lover’s token,\nwhich was mortifying enough if they were not.\n\nMrs. Swancourt came now to where they were sitting, to select a flat\nboulder for spreading their table-cloth upon, and, amid the discussion\non that subject, the matter pending between Knight and Elfride was\nshelved for a while. He read her refusal so certainly as the bashfulness\nof a girl in a novel position, that, upon the whole, he could tolerate\nsuch a beginning. Could Knight have been told that it was a sense of\nfidelity struggling against new love, whilst no less assuring as to his\nultimate victory, it might have entirely abstracted the wish to secure\nit.\n\nAt the same time a slight constraint of manner was visible between\nthem for the remainder of the afternoon. The tide turned, and they were\nobliged to ascend to higher ground. The day glided on to its end with\nthe usual quiet dreamy passivity of such occasions--when every deed done\nand thing thought is in endeavouring to avoid doing and thinking\nmore. Looking idly over the verge of a crag, they beheld their stone\ndining-table gradually being splashed upon and their crumbs and\nfragments all washed away by the incoming sea. The vicar drew a moral\nlesson from the scene; Knight replied in the same satisfied strain. And\nthen the waves rolled in furiously--the neutral green-and-blue tongues\nof water slid up the slopes, and were metamorphosed into foam by a\ncareless blow, falling back white and faint, and leaving trailing\nfollowers behind.\n\nThe passing of a heavy shower was the next scene--driving them to\nshelter in a shallow cave--after which the horses were put in, and they\nstarted to return homeward. By the time they reached the higher levels\nthe sky had again cleared, and the sunset rays glanced directly upon\nthe wet uphill road they had climbed. The ruts formed by their\ncarriage-wheels on the ascent--a pair of Liliputian canals--were as\nshining bars of gold, tapering to nothing in the distance. Upon this\nalso they turned their backs, and night spread over the sea.\n\nThe evening was chilly, and there was no moon. Knight sat close to\nElfride, and, when the darkness rendered the position of a person a\nmatter of uncertainty, particularly close. Elfride edged away.\n\n‘I hope you allow me my place ungrudgingly?’ he whispered.\n\n‘Oh yes; ‘tis the least I can do in common civility,’ she said,\naccenting the words so that he might recognize them as his own returned.\n\nBoth of them felt delicately balanced between two possibilities. Thus\nthey reached home.\n\nTo Knight this mild experience was delightful. It was to him a gentle\ninnocent time--a time which, though there may not be much in it, seldom\nrepeats itself in a man’s life, and has a peculiar dearness when glanced\nat retrospectively. He is not inconveniently deep in love, and is lulled\nby a peaceful sense of being able to enjoy the most trivial thing with\na childlike enjoyment. The movement of a wave, the colour of a stone,\nanything, was enough for Knight’s drowsy thoughts of that day to\nprecipitate themselves upon. Even the sermonizing platitudes the\nvicar had delivered himself of--chiefly because something seemed to\nbe professionally required of him in the presence of a man of Knight’s\nproclivities--were swallowed whole. The presence of Elfride led him not\nmerely to tolerate that kind of talk from the necessities of ordinary\ncourtesy; but he listened to it--took in the ideas with an enjoyable\nmake-believe that they were proper and necessary, and indulged in a\nconservative feeling that the face of things was complete.\n\nEntering her room that evening Elfride found a packet for herself on\nthe dressing-table. How it came there she did not know. She tremblingly\nundid the folds of white paper that covered it. Yes; it was the treasure\nof a morocco case, containing those treasures of ornament she had\nrefused in the daytime.\n\nElfride dressed herself in them for a moment, looked at herself in the\nglass, blushed red, and put them away. They filled her dreams all that\nnight. Never had she seen anything so lovely, and never was it more\nclear that as an honest woman she was in duty bound to refuse them.\nWhy it was not equally clear to her that duty required more vigorous\nco-ordinate conduct as well, let those who dissect her say.\n\nThe next morning glared in like a spectre upon her. It was Stephen’s\nletter-day, and she was bound to meet the postman--to stealthily do a\ndeed she had never liked, to secure an end she now had ceased to desire.\n\nBut she went.\n\nThere were two letters.\n\nOne was from the bank at St. Launce’s, in which she had a small private\ndeposit--probably something about interest. She put that in her\npocket for a moment, and going indoors and upstairs to be safer from\nobservation, tremblingly opened Stephen’s.\n\nWhat was this he said to her?\n\nShe was to go to the St. Launce’s Bank and take a sum of money which\nthey had received private advices to pay her.\n\nThe sum was two hundred pounds.\n\nThere was no check, order, or anything of the nature of guarantee. In\nfact the information amounted to this: the money was now in the St.\nLaunce’s Bank, standing in her name.\n\nShe instantly opened the other letter. It contained a deposit-note from\nthe bank for the sum of two hundred pounds which had that day been\nadded to her account. Stephen’s information, then, was correct, and the\ntransfer made.\n\n‘I have saved this in one year,’ Stephen’s letter went on to say, ‘and\nwhat so proper as well as pleasant for me to do as to hand it over to\nyou to keep for your use? I have plenty for myself, independently of\nthis. Should you not be disposed to let it lie idle in the bank, get\nyour father to invest it in your name on good security. It is a little\npresent to you from your more than betrothed. He will, I think, Elfride,\nfeel now that my pretensions to your hand are anything but the dream of\na silly boy not worth rational consideration.’\n\nWith a natural delicacy, Elfride, in mentioning her father’s marriage,\nhad refrained from all allusion to the pecuniary resources of the lady.\n\nLeaving this matter-of-fact subject, he went on, somewhat after his\nboyish manner:\n\n‘Do you remember, darling, that first morning of my arrival at your\nhouse, when your father read at prayers the miracle of healing the sick\nof the palsy--where he is told to take up his bed and walk? I do, and I\ncan now so well realize the force of that passage. The smallest piece of\nmat is the bed of the Oriental, and yesterday I saw a native perform the\nvery action, which reminded me to mention it. But you are better read\nthan I, and perhaps you knew all this long ago....One day I bought some\nsmall native idols to send home to you as curiosities, but afterwards\nfinding they had been cast in England, made to look old, and shipped\nover, I threw them away in disgust.\n\n‘Speaking of this reminds me that we are obliged to import all our\nhouse-building ironwork from England. Never was such foresight required\nto be exercised in building houses as here. Before we begin, we have\nto order every column, lock, hinge, and screw that will be required.\nWe cannot go into the next street, as in London, and get them cast at\na minute’s notice. Mr. L. says somebody will have to go to England very\nsoon and superintend the selection of a large order of this kind. I only\nwish I may be the man.’\n\nThere before her lay the deposit-receipt for the two hundred pounds,\nand beside it the elegant present of Knight. Elfride grew cold--then her\ncheeks felt heated by beating blood. If by destroying the piece of paper\nthe whole transaction could have been withdrawn from her experience, she\nwould willingly have sacrificed the money it represented. She did\nnot know what to do in either case. She almost feared to let the two\narticles lie in juxtaposition: so antagonistic were the interests they\nrepresented that a miraculous repulsion of one by the other was almost\nto be expected.\n\nThat day she was seen little of. By the evening she had come to a\nresolution, and acted upon it. The packet was sealed up--with a tear\nof regret as she closed the case upon the pretty forms it\ncontained--directed, and placed upon the writing-table in Knight’s room.\nAnd a letter was written to Stephen, stating that as yet she hardly\nunderstood her position with regard to the money sent; but declaring\nthat she was ready to fulfil her promise to marry him. After this letter\nhad been written she delayed posting it--although never ceasing to feel\nstrenuously that the deed must be done.\n\nSeveral days passed. There was another Indian letter for Elfride. Coming\nunexpectedly, her father saw it, but made no remark--why, she could not\ntell. The news this time was absolutely overwhelming. Stephen, as he\nhad wished, had been actually chosen as the most fitting to execute the\niron-work commission he had alluded to as impending. This duty completed\nhe would have three months’ leave. His letter continued that he should\nfollow it in a week, and should take the opportunity to plainly ask\nher father to permit the engagement. Then came a page expressive of his\ndelight and hers at the reunion; and finally, the information that he\nwould write to the shipping agents, asking them to telegraph and tell\nher when the ship bringing him home should be in sight--knowing how\nacceptable such information would be.\n\nElfride lived and moved now as in a dream. Knight had at first become\nalmost angry at her persistent refusal of his offering--and no less with\nthe manner than the fact of it. But he saw that she began to look worn\nand ill--and his vexation lessened to simple perplexity.\n\nHe ceased now to remain in the house for long hours together as before,\nbut made it a mere centre for antiquarian and geological excursions in\nthe neighbourhood. Throw up his cards and go away he fain would have\ndone, but could not. And, thus, availing himself of the privileges of\na relative, he went in and out the premises as fancy led him--but still\nlingered on.\n\n‘I don’t wish to stay here another day if my presence is distasteful,’\nhe said one afternoon. ‘At first you used to imply that I was severe\nwith you; and when I am kind you treat me unfairly.’\n\n‘No, no. Don’t say so.’\n\nThe origin of their acquaintanceship had been such as to render their\nmanner towards each other peculiar and uncommon. It was of a kind to\ncause them to speak out their minds on any feelings of objection and\ndifference: to be reticent on gentler matters.\n\n‘I have a good mind to go away and never trouble you again,’ continued\nKnight.\n\nShe said nothing, but the eloquent expression of her eyes and wan face\nwas enough to reproach him for harshness.\n\n‘Do you like me to be here, then?’ inquired Knight gently.\n\n‘Yes,’ she said. Fidelity to the old love and truth to the new were\nranged on opposite sides, and truth virtuelessly prevailed.\n\n‘Then I’ll stay a little longer,’ said Knight.\n\n‘Don’t be vexed if I keep by myself a good deal, will you? Perhaps\nsomething may happen, and I may tell you something.’\n\n‘Mere coyness,’ said Knight to himself; and went away with a lighter\nheart. The trick of reading truly the enigmatical forces at work in\nwomen at given times, which with some men is an unerring instinct, is\npeculiar to minds less direct and honest than Knight’s.\n\nThe next evening, about five o’clock, before Knight had returned from\na pilgrimage along the shore, a man walked up to the house. He was a\nmessenger from Camelton, a town a few miles off, to which place the\nrailway had been advanced during the summer.\n\n‘A telegram for Miss Swancourt, and three and sixpence to pay for the\nspecial messenger.’ Miss Swancourt sent out the money, signed the paper,\nand opened her letter with a trembling hand. She read:\n\n\n‘Johnson, Liverpool, to Miss Swancourt, Endelstow, near Castle Boterel.\n\n‘Amaryllis telegraphed off Holyhead, four o’clock. Expect will dock and\nland passengers at Canning’s Basin ten o’clock to-morrow morning.’\n\n\nHer father called her into the study.\n\n‘Elfride, who sent you that message?’ he asked suspiciously.\n\n‘Johnson.’ ‘Who is Johnson, for Heaven’s sake?’\n\n‘I don’t know.’\n\n‘The deuce you don’t! Who is to know, then?’\n\n‘I have never heard of him till now.’\n\n‘That’s a singular story, isn’t it.’\n\n‘I don’t know.’\n\n‘Come, come, miss! What was the telegram?’\n\n‘Do you really wish to know, papa?’\n\n‘Well, I do.’\n\n‘Remember, I am a full-grown woman now.’\n\n‘Well, what then?’\n\n‘Being a woman, and not a child, I may, I think, have a secret or two.’\n\n‘You will, it seems.’\n\n‘Women have, as a rule.’\n\n‘But don’t keep them. So speak out.’\n\n‘If you will not press me now, I give my word to tell you the meaning of\nall this before the week is past.’\n\n‘On your honour?’\n\n‘On my honour.’\n\n‘Very well. I have had a certain suspicion, you know; and I shall be\nglad to find it false. I don’t like your manner lately.’\n\n‘At the end of the week, I said, papa.’\n\nHer father did not reply, and Elfride left the room.\n\nShe began to look out for the postman again. Three mornings later he\nbrought an inland letter from Stephen. It contained very little matter,\nhaving been written in haste; but the meaning was bulky enough. Stephen\nsaid that, having executed a commission in Liverpool, he should arrive\nat his father’s house, East Endelstow, at five or six o’clock that same\nevening; that he would after dusk walk on to the next village, and meet\nher, if she would, in the church porch, as in the old time. He proposed\nthis plan because he thought it unadvisable to call formally at her\nhouse so late in the evening; yet he could not sleep without having seen\nher. The minutes would seem hours till he clasped her in his arms.\n\nElfride was still steadfast in her opinion that honour compelled her to\nmeet him. Probably the very longing to avoid him lent additional weight\nto the conviction; for she was markedly one of those who sigh for the\nunattainable--to whom, superlatively, a hope is pleasing because not a\npossession. And she knew it so well that her intellect was inclined to\nexaggerate this defect in herself.\n\nSo during the day she looked her duty steadfastly in the face; read\nWordsworth’s astringent yet depressing ode to that Deity; committed\nherself to her guidance; and still felt the weight of chance desires.\n\nBut she began to take a melancholy pleasure in contemplating the\nsacrifice of herself to the man whom a maidenly sense of propriety\ncompelled her to regard as her only possible husband. She would meet\nhim, and do all that lay in her power to marry him. To guard against\na relapse, a note was at once despatched to his father’s cottage for\nStephen on his arrival, fixing an hour for the interview.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXI\n\n     ‘On thy cold grey stones, O sea!’\n\n\nStephen had said that he should come by way of Bristol, and thence by a\nsteamer to Castle Boterel, in order to avoid the long journey over the\nhills from St. Launce’s. He did not know of the extension of the railway\nto Camelton.\n\nDuring the afternoon a thought occurred to Elfride, that from any cliff\nalong the shore it would be possible to see the steamer some hours\nbefore its arrival.\n\nShe had accumulated religious force enough to do an act of\nsupererogation. The act was this--to go to some point of land and watch\nfor the ship that brought her future husband home.\n\nIt was a cloudy afternoon. Elfride was often diverted from a purpose by\na dull sky; and though she used to persuade herself that the weather was\nas fine as possible on the other side of the clouds, she could not bring\nabout any practical result from this fancy. Now, her mood was such that\nthe humid sky harmonized with it.\n\nHaving ascended and passed over a hill behind the house, Elfride came to\na small stream. She used it as a guide to the coast. It was smaller than\nthat in her own valley, and flowed altogether at a higher level. Bushes\nlined the slopes of its shallow trough; but at the bottom, where the\nwater ran, was a soft green carpet, in a strip two or three yards wide.\n\nIn winter, the water flowed over the grass; in summer, as now, it\ntrickled along a channel in the midst.\n\nElfride had a sensation of eyes regarding her from somewhere. She\nturned, and there was Mr. Knight. He had dropped into the valley from\nthe side of the hill. She felt a thrill of pleasure, and rebelliously\nallowed it to exist.\n\n‘What utter loneliness to find you in!’\n\n‘I am going to the shore by tracking the stream. I believe it empties\nitself not far off, in a silver thread of water, over a cascade of great\nheight.’\n\n‘Why do you load yourself with that heavy telescope?’\n\n‘To look over the sea with it,’ she said faintly.\n\n‘I’ll carry it for you to your journey’s end.’ And he took the glass\nfrom her unresisting hands. ‘It cannot be half a mile further. See,\nthere is the water.’ He pointed to a short fragment of level muddy-gray\ncolour, cutting against the sky.\n\nElfride had already scanned the small surface of ocean visible, and had\nseen no ship.\n\nThey walked along in company, sometimes with the brook between them--for\nit was no wider than a man’s stride--sometimes close together. The green\ncarpet grew swampy, and they kept higher up.\n\nOne of the two ridges between which they walked dwindled lower and\nbecame insignificant. That on the right hand rose with their advance,\nand terminated in a clearly defined edge against the light, as if it\nwere abruptly sawn off. A little further, and the bed of the rivulet\nended in the same fashion.\n\nThey had come to a bank breast-high, and over it the valley was no\nlonger to be seen. It was withdrawn cleanly and completely. In its\nplace was sky and boundless atmosphere; and perpendicularly down beneath\nthem--small and far off--lay the corrugated surface of the Atlantic.\n\nThe small stream here found its death. Running over the precipice it was\ndispersed in spray before it was half-way down, and falling like rain\nupon projecting ledges, made minute grassy meadows of them. At the\nbottom the water-drops soaked away amid the debris of the cliff. This\nwas the inglorious end of the river.\n\n‘What are you looking for? said Knight, following the direction of her\neyes.\n\nShe was gazing hard at a black object--nearer to the shore than to the\nhorizon--from the summit of which came a nebulous haze, stretching like\ngauze over the sea.\n\n‘The Puffin, a little summer steamboat--from Bristol to Castle Boterel,’\nshe said. ‘I think that is it--look. Will you give me the glass?’\n\nKnight pulled open the old-fashioned but powerful telescope, and handed\nit to Elfride, who had looked on with heavy eyes.\n\n‘I can’t keep it up now,’ she said.\n\n‘Rest it on my shoulder.’\n\n‘It is too high.’\n\n‘Under my arm.’\n\n‘Too low. You may look instead,’ she murmured weakly.\n\nKnight raised the glass to his eye, and swept the sea till the Puffin\nentered its field.\n\n‘Yes, it is the Puffin--a tiny craft. I can see her figure-head\ndistinctly--a bird with a beak as big as its head.’\n\n‘Can you see the deck?’\n\n‘Wait a minute; yes, pretty clearly. And I can see the black forms\nof the passengers against its white surface. One of them has taken\nsomething from another--a glass, I think--yes, it is--and he is\nlevelling it in this direction. Depend upon it we are conspicuous\nobjects against the sky to them. Now, it seems to rain upon them, and\nthey put on overcoats and open umbrellas. They vanish and go below--all\nbut that one who has borrowed the glass. He is a slim young fellow, and\nstill watches us.’\n\nElfride grew pale, and shifted her little feet uneasily.\n\nKnight lowered the glass.\n\n‘I think we had better return,’ he said. ‘That cloud which is raining on\nthem may soon reach us. Why, you look ill. How is that?’\n\n‘Something in the air affects my face.’\n\n‘Those fair cheeks are very fastidious, I fear,’ returned Knight\ntenderly. ‘This air would make those rosy that were never so before, one\nwould think--eh, Nature’s spoilt child?’\n\nElfride’s colour returned again.\n\n‘There is more to see behind us, after all,’ said Knight.\n\nShe turned her back upon the boat and Stephen Smith, and saw, towering\nstill higher than themselves, the vertical face of the hill on the\nright, which did not project seaward so far as the bed of the valley,\nbut formed the back of a small cove, and so was visible like a concave\nwall, bending round from their position towards the left.\n\nThe composition of the huge hill was revealed to its backbone and marrow\nhere at its rent extremity. It consisted of a vast stratification of\nblackish-gray slate, unvaried in its whole height by a single change of\nshade.\n\nIt is with cliffs and mountains as with persons; they have what is\ncalled a presence, which is not necessarily proportionate to their\nactual bulk. A little cliff will impress you powerfully; a great one not\nat all. It depends, as with man, upon the countenance of the cliff.\n\n‘I cannot bear to look at that cliff,’ said Elfride. ‘It has a horrid\npersonality, and makes me shudder. We will go.’\n\n‘Can you climb?’ said Knight. ‘If so, we will ascend by that path over\nthe grim old fellow’s brow.’\n\n‘Try me,’ said Elfride disdainfully. ‘I have ascended steeper slopes\nthan that.’\n\nFrom where they had been loitering, a grassy path wound along inside a\nbank, placed as a safeguard for unwary pedestrians, to the top of the\nprecipice, and over it along the hill in an inland direction.\n\n‘Take my arm, Miss Swancourt,’ said Knight.\n\n‘I can get on better without it, thank you.’\n\nWhen they were one quarter of the way up, Elfride stopped to take\nbreath. Knight stretched out his hand.\n\nShe took it, and they ascended the remaining slope together. Reaching\nthe very top, they sat down to rest by mutual consent.\n\n‘Heavens, what an altitude!’ said Knight between his pants, and looking\nfar over the sea. The cascade at the bottom of the slope appeared a mere\nspan in height from where they were now.\n\nElfride was looking to the left. The steamboat was in full view again,\nand by reason of the vast surface of sea their higher position uncovered\nit seemed almost close to the shore.\n\n‘Over that edge,’ said Knight, ‘where nothing but vacancy appears, is a\nmoving compact mass. The wind strikes the face of the rock, runs up it,\nrises like a fountain to a height far above our heads, curls over us\nin an arch, and disperses behind us. In fact, an inverted cascade is\nthere--as perfect as the Niagara Falls--but rising instead of falling,\nand air instead of water. Now look here.’\n\nKnight threw a stone over the bank, aiming it as if to go onward over\nthe cliff. Reaching the verge, it towered into the air like a bird,\nturned back, and alighted on the ground behind them. They themselves\nwere in a dead calm.\n\n‘A boat crosses Niagara immediately at the foot of the falls, where\nthe water is quite still, the fallen mass curving under it. We are in\nprecisely the same position with regard to our atmospheric cataract\nhere. If you run back from the cliff fifty yards, you will be in a brisk\nwind. Now I daresay over the bank is a little backward current.’\n\nKnight rose and leant over the bank. No sooner was his head above it\nthan his hat appeared to be sucked from his head--slipping over his\nforehead in a seaward direction.\n\n‘That’s the backward eddy, as I told you,’ he cried, and vanished over\nthe little bank after his hat.\n\nElfride waited one minute; he did not return. She waited another, and\nthere was no sign of him.\n\nA few drops of rain fell, then a sudden shower.\n\nShe arose, and looked over the bank. On the other side were two or three\nyards of level ground--then a short steep preparatory slope--then the\nverge of the precipice.\n\nOn the slope was Knight, his hat on his head. He was on his hands and\nknees, trying to climb back to the level ground. The rain had wetted the\nshaly surface of the incline. A slight superficial wetting of the soil\nhereabout made it far more slippery to stand on than the same soil\nthoroughly drenched. The inner substance was still hard, and was\nlubricated by the moistened film.\n\n‘I find a difficulty in getting back,’ said Knight.\n\nElfride’s heart fell like lead.\n\n‘But you can get back?’ she wildly inquired.\n\nKnight strove with all his might for two or three minutes, and the drops\nof perspiration began to bead his brow.\n\n‘No, I am unable to do it,’ he answered.\n\nElfride, by a wrench of thought, forced away from her mind the sensation\nthat Knight was in bodily danger. But attempt to help him she must. She\nventured upon the treacherous incline, propped herself with the closed\ntelescope, and gave him her hand before he saw her movements.\n\n‘O Elfride! why did you?’ said he. ‘I am afraid you have only endangered\nyourself.’\n\nAnd as if to prove his statement, in making an endeavour by her\nassistance they both slipped lower, and then he was again stayed. His\nfoot was propped by a bracket of quartz rock, balanced on the verge of\nthe precipice. Fixed by this, he steadied her, her head being about a\nfoot below the beginning of the slope. Elfride had dropped the glass; it\nrolled to the edge and vanished over it into a nether sky.\n\n‘Hold tightly to me,’ he said.\n\nShe flung her arms round his neck with such a firm grasp that whilst he\nremained it was impossible for her to fall.\n\n‘Don’t be flurried,’ Knight continued. ‘So long as we stay above this\nblock we are perfectly safe. Wait a moment whilst I consider what we had\nbetter do.’\n\nHe turned his eyes to the dizzy depths beneath them, and surveyed the\nposition of affairs.\n\nTwo glances told him a tale with ghastly distinctness. It was that,\nunless they performed their feat of getting up the slope with the\nprecision of machines, they were over the edge and whirling in mid-air.\n\nFor this purpose it was necessary that he should recover the breath and\nstrength which his previous efforts had cost him. So he still waited,\nand looked in the face of the enemy.\n\nThe crest of this terrible natural facade passed among the neighbouring\ninhabitants as being seven hundred feet above the water it overhung.\nIt had been proved by actual measurement to be not a foot less than six\nhundred and fifty.\n\nThat is to say, it is nearly three times the height of Flamborough, half\nas high again as the South Foreland, a hundred feet higher than\nBeachy Head--the loftiest promontory on the east or south side of this\nisland--twice the height of St. Aldhelm’s, thrice as high as the Lizard,\nand just double the height of St. Bee’s. One sea-bord point on the\nwestern coast is known to surpass it in altitude, but only by a few\nfeet. This is Great Orme’s Head, in Caernarvonshire.\n\nAnd it must be remembered that the cliff exhibits an intensifying\nfeature which some of those are without--sheer perpendicularity from the\nhalf-tide level.\n\nYet this remarkable rampart forms no headland: it rather walls in an\ninlet--the promontory on each side being much lower. Thus, far from\nbeing salient, its horizontal section is concave. The sea, rolling\ndirect from the shores of North America, has in fact eaten a chasm into\nthe middle of a hill, and the giant, embayed and unobtrusive, stands in\nthe rear of pigmy supporters. Not least singularly, neither hill, chasm,\nnor precipice has a name. On this account I will call the precipice the\nCliff without a Name.*\n\n     * See Preface\n\nWhat gave an added terror to its height was its blackness. And upon this\ndark face the beating of ten thousand west winds had formed a kind of\nbloom, which had a visual effect not unlike that of a Hambro’ grape.\nMoreover it seemed to float off into the atmosphere, and inspire terror\nthrough the lungs.\n\n‘This piece of quartz, supporting my feet, is on the very nose of\nthe cliff,’ said Knight, breaking the silence after his rigid stoical\nmeditation. ‘Now what you are to do is this. Clamber up my body till\nyour feet are on my shoulders: when you are there you will, I think, be\nable to climb on to level ground.’\n\n‘What will you do?’\n\n‘Wait whilst you run for assistance.’\n\n‘I ought to have done that in the first place, ought I not?’\n\n‘I was in the act of slipping, and should have reached no stand-point\nwithout your weight, in all probability. But don’t let us talk. Be\nbrave, Elfride, and climb.’\n\nShe prepared to ascend, saying, ‘This is the moment I anticipated when\non the tower. I thought it would come!’\n\n‘This is not a time for superstition,’ said Knight. ‘Dismiss all that.’\n\n‘I will,’ she said humbly.\n\n‘Now put your foot into my hand: next the other. That’s good--well done.\nHold to my shoulder.’\n\nShe placed her feet upon the stirrup he made of his hand, and was high\nenough to get a view of the natural surface of the hill over the bank.\n\n‘Can you now climb on to level ground?’\n\n‘I am afraid not. I will try.’\n\n‘What can you see?’\n\n‘The sloping common.’\n\n‘What upon it?’\n\n‘Purple heather and some grass.’\n\n‘Nothing more--no man or human being of any kind?’\n\n‘Nobody.’\n\n‘Now try to get higher in this way. You see that tuft of sea-pink above\nyou. Get that well into your hand, but don’t trust to it entirely. Then\nstep upon my shoulder, and I think you will reach the top.’\n\nWith trembling limbs she did exactly as he told her. The preternatural\nquiet and solemnity of his manner overspread upon herself, and gave her\na courage not her own. She made a spring from the top of his shoulder,\nand was up.\n\nThen she turned to look at him.\n\nBy an ill fate, the force downwards of her bound, added to his own\nweight, had been too much for the block of quartz upon which his feet\ndepended. It was, indeed, originally an igneous protrusion into the\nenormous masses of black strata, which had since been worn away from the\nsides of the alien fragment by centuries of frost and rain, and now left\nit without much support.\n\nIt moved. Knight seized a tuft of sea-pink with each hand.\n\nThe quartz rock which had been his salvation was worse than useless now.\nIt rolled over, out of sight, and away into the same nether sky that had\nengulfed the telescope.\n\nOne of the tufts by which he held came out at the root, and Knight began\nto follow the quartz. It was a terrible moment. Elfride uttered a low\nwild wail of agony, bowed her head, and covered her face with her hands.\n\nBetween the turf-covered slope and the gigantic perpendicular rock\nintervened a weather-worn series of jagged edges, forming a face yet\nsteeper than the former slope. As he slowly slid inch by inch upon\nthese, Knight made a last desperate dash at the lowest tuft of\nvegetation--the last outlying knot of starved herbage ere the rock\nappeared in all its bareness. It arrested his further descent. Knight\nwas now literally suspended by his arms; but the incline of the\nbrow being what engineers would call about a quarter in one, it was\nsufficient to relieve his arms of a portion of his weight, but was very\nfar from offering an adequately flat face to support him.\n\nIn spite of this dreadful tension of body and mind, Knight found time\nfor a moment of thankfulness. Elfride was safe.\n\nShe lay on her side above him--her fingers clasped. Seeing him again\nsteady, she jumped upon her feet.\n\n‘Now, if I can only save you by running for help!’ she cried. ‘Oh, I\nwould have died instead! Why did you try so hard to deliver me?’ And she\nturned away wildly to run for assistance.\n\n‘Elfride, how long will it take you to run to Endelstow and back?’\n\n‘Three-quarters of an hour.’\n\n‘That won’t do; my hands will not hold out ten minutes. And is there\nnobody nearer?’\n\n‘No; unless a chance passer may happen to be.’\n\n‘He would have nothing with him that could save me. Is there a pole or\nstick of any kind on the common?’\n\nShe gazed around. The common was bare of everything but heather and\ngrass.\n\nA minute--perhaps more time--was passed in mute thought by both. On a\nsudden the blank and helpless agony left her face. She vanished over the\nbank from his sight.\n\nKnight felt himself in the presence of a personalized loneliness.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXII\n\n     ‘A woman’s way.’\n\n\nHaggard cliffs, of every ugly altitude, are as common as sea-fowl along\nthe line of coast between Exmoor and Land’s End; but this outflanked and\nencompassed specimen was the ugliest of them all. Their summits are not\nsafe places for scientific experiment on the principles of air-currents,\nas Knight had now found, to his dismay.\n\nHe still clutched the face of the escarpment--not with the frenzied\nhold of despair, but with a dogged determination to make the most of\nhis every jot of endurance, and so give the longest possible scope to\nElfride’s intentions, whatever they might be.\n\nHe reclined hand in hand with the world in its infancy. Not a blade, not\nan insect, which spoke of the present, was between him and the past. The\ninveterate antagonism of these black precipices to all strugglers for\nlife is in no way more forcibly suggested than by the paucity of tufts\nof grass, lichens, or confervae on their outermost ledges.\n\nKnight pondered on the meaning of Elfride’s hasty disappearance, but\ncould not avoid an instinctive conclusion that there existed but a\ndoubtful hope for him. As far as he could judge, his sole chance of\ndeliverance lay in the possibility of a rope or pole being brought; and\nthis possibility was remote indeed. The soil upon these high downs was\nleft so untended that they were unenclosed for miles, except by a\ncasual bank or dry wall, and were rarely visited but for the purpose\nof collecting or counting the flock which found a scanty means of\nsubsistence thereon.\n\nAt first, when death appeared improbable, because it had never visited\nhim before, Knight could think of no future, nor of anything connected\nwith his past. He could only look sternly at Nature’s treacherous\nattempt to put an end to him, and strive to thwart her.\n\nFrom the fact that the cliff formed the inner face of the segment of a\nhuge cylinder, having the sky for a top and the sea for a bottom, which\nenclosed the cove to the extent of more than a semicircle, he could see\nthe vertical face curving round on each side of him. He looked far down\nthe facade, and realized more thoroughly how it threatened him. Grimness\nwas in every feature, and to its very bowels the inimical shape was\ndesolation.\n\nBy one of those familiar conjunctions of things wherewith the inanimate\nworld baits the mind of man when he pauses in moments of suspense,\nopposite Knight’s eyes was an imbedded fossil, standing forth in low\nrelief from the rock. It was a creature with eyes. The eyes, dead and\nturned to stone, were even now regarding him. It was one of the early\ncrustaceans called Trilobites. Separated by millions of years in their\nlives, Knight and this underling seemed to have met in their death. It\nwas the single instance within reach of his vision of anything that had\never been alive and had had a body to save, as he himself had now.\n\nThe creature represented but a low type of animal existence, for never\nin their vernal years had the plains indicated by those numberless slaty\nlayers been traversed by an intelligence worthy of the name. Zoophytes,\nmollusca, shell-fish, were the highest developments of those ancient\ndates. The immense lapses of time each formation represented had known\nnothing of the dignity of man. They were grand times, but they were mean\ntimes too, and mean were their relics. He was to be with the small in\nhis death.\n\nKnight was a geologist; and such is the supremacy of habit over\noccasion, as a pioneer of the thoughts of men, that at this dreadful\njuncture his mind found time to take in, by a momentary sweep, the\nvaried scenes that had had their day between this creature’s epoch and\nhis own. There is no place like a cleft landscape for bringing home such\nimaginings as these.\n\nTime closed up like a fan before him. He saw himself at one extremity\nof the years, face to face with the beginning and all the intermediate\ncenturies simultaneously. Fierce men, clothed in the hides of beasts,\nand carrying, for defence and attack, huge clubs and pointed spears,\nrose from the rock, like the phantoms before the doomed Macbeth.\nThey lived in hollows, woods, and mud huts--perhaps in caves of the\nneighbouring rocks. Behind them stood an earlier band. No man was there.\nHuge elephantine forms, the mastodon, the hippopotamus, the tapir,\nantelopes of monstrous size, the megatherium, and the myledon--all, for\nthe moment, in juxtaposition. Further back, and overlapped by these,\nwere perched huge-billed birds and swinish creatures as large as horses.\nStill more shadowy were the sinister crocodilian outlines--alligators\nand other uncouth shapes, culminating in the colossal lizard, the\niguanodon. Folded behind were dragon forms and clouds of flying\nreptiles: still underneath were fishy beings of lower development; and\nso on, till the lifetime scenes of the fossil confronting him were\na present and modern condition of things. These images passed before\nKnight’s inner eye in less than half a minute, and he was again\nconsidering the actual present. Was he to die? The mental picture of\nElfride in the world, without himself to cherish her, smote his heart\nlike a whip. He had hoped for deliverance, but what could a girl do? He\ndared not move an inch. Was Death really stretching out his hand? The\nprevious sensation, that it was improbable he would die, was fainter\nnow.\n\nHowever, Knight still clung to the cliff.\n\nTo those musing weather-beaten West-country folk who pass the greater\npart of their days and nights out of doors, Nature seems to have moods\nin other than a poetical sense: predilections for certain deeds at\ncertain times, without any apparent law to govern or season to account\nfor them. She is read as a person with a curious temper; as one who does\nnot scatter kindnesses and cruelties alternately, impartially, and in\norder, but heartless severities or overwhelming generosities in lawless\ncaprice. Man’s case is always that of the prodigal’s favourite or the\nmiser’s pensioner. In her unfriendly moments there seems a feline fun\nin her tricks, begotten by a foretaste of her pleasure in swallowing the\nvictim.\n\nSuch a way of thinking had been absurd to Knight, but he began to adopt\nit now. He was first spitted on to a rock. New tortures followed. The\nrain increased, and persecuted him with an exceptional persistency which\nhe was moved to believe owed its cause to the fact that he was in such\na wretched state already. An entirely new order of things could be\nobserved in this introduction of rain upon the scene. It rained upwards\ninstead of down. The strong ascending air carried the rain-drops with\nit in its race up the escarpment, coming to him with such velocity that\nthey stuck into his flesh like cold needles. Each drop was virtually a\nshaft, and it pierced him to his skin. The water-shafts seemed to lift\nhim on their points: no downward rain ever had such a torturing effect.\nIn a brief space he was drenched, except in two places. These were on\nthe top of his shoulders and on the crown of his hat.\n\nThe wind, though not intense in other situations was strong here. It\ntugged at his coat and lifted it. We are mostly accustomed to look upon\nall opposition which is not animate, as that of the stolid, inexorable\nhand of indifference, which wears out the patience more than the\nstrength. Here, at any rate, hostility did not assume that slow and\nsickening form. It was a cosmic agency, active, lashing, eager for\nconquest: determination; not an insensate standing in the way.\n\nKnight had over-estimated the strength of his hands. They were getting\nweak already. ‘She will never come again; she has been gone ten\nminutes,’ he said to himself.\n\nThis mistake arose from the unusual compression of his experiences just\nnow: she had really been gone but three.\n\n‘As many more minutes will be my end,’ he thought.\n\nNext came another instance of the incapacity of the mind to make\ncomparisons at such times.\n\n‘This is a summer afternoon,’ he said, ‘and there can never have been\nsuch a heavy and cold rain on a summer day in my life before.’\n\nHe was again mistaken. The rain was quite ordinary in quantity; the air\nin temperature. It was, as is usual, the menacing attitude in which they\napproached him that magnified their powers.\n\nHe again looked straight downwards, the wind and the water-dashes\nlifting his moustache, scudding up his cheeks, under his eyelids,\nand into his eyes. This is what he saw down there: the surface of\nthe sea--visually just past his toes, and under his feet; actually\none-eighth of a mile, or more than two hundred yards, below them. We\ncolour according to our moods the objects we survey. The sea would have\nbeen a deep neutral blue, had happier auspices attended the gazer it was\nnow no otherwise than distinctly black to his vision. That narrow white\nborder was foam, he knew well; but its boisterous tosses were so distant\nas to appear a pulsation only, and its plashing was barely audible. A\nwhite border to a black sea--his funeral pall and its edging.\n\nThe world was to some extent turned upside down for him. Rain descended\nfrom below. Beneath his feet was aerial space and the unknown; above him\nwas the firm, familiar ground, and upon it all that he loved best.\n\nPitiless nature had then two voices, and two only. The nearer was the\nvoice of the wind in his ears rising and falling as it mauled and thrust\nhim hard or softly. The second and distant one was the moan of that\nunplummetted ocean below and afar--rubbing its restless flank against\nthe Cliff without a Name.\n\nKnight perseveringly held fast. Had he any faith in Elfride? Perhaps.\nLove is faith, and faith, like a gathered flower, will rootlessly live\non.\n\nNobody would have expected the sun to shine on such an evening as this.\nYet it appeared, low down upon the sea. Not with its natural golden\nfringe, sweeping the furthest ends of the landscape, not with the\nstrange glare of whiteness which it sometimes puts on as an alternative\nto colour, but as a splotch of vermilion red upon a leaden ground--a red\nface looking on with a drunken leer.\n\nMost men who have brains know it, and few are so foolish as to disguise\nthis fact from themselves or others, even though an ostentatious display\nmay be called self-conceit. Knight, without showing it much, knew that\nhis intellect was above the average. And he thought--he could not help\nthinking--that his death would be a deliberate loss to earth of good\nmaterial; that such an experiment in killing might have been practised\nupon some less developed life.\n\nA fancy some people hold, when in a bitter mood, is that inexorable\ncircumstance only tries to prevent what intelligence attempts. Renounce\na desire for a long-contested position, and go on another tack, and\nafter a while the prize is thrown at you, seemingly in disappointment\nthat no more tantalizing is possible.\n\nKnight gave up thoughts of life utterly and entirely, and turned to\ncontemplate the Dark Valley and the unknown future beyond. Into the\nshadowy depths of these speculations we will not follow him. Let it\nsuffice to state what ensued.\n\nAt that moment of taking no more thought for this life, something\ndisturbed the outline of the bank above him. A spot appeared. It was the\nhead of Elfride.\n\nKnight immediately prepared to welcome life again.\n\nThe expression of a face consigned to utter loneliness, when a friend\nfirst looks in upon it, is moving in the extreme. In rowing seaward to\na light-ship or sea-girt lighthouse, where, without any immediate terror\nof death, the inmates experience the gloom of monotonous seclusion, the\ngrateful eloquence of their countenances at the greeting, expressive of\nthankfulness for the visit, is enough to stir the emotions of the most\ncareless observer.\n\nKnight’s upward look at Elfride was of a nature with, but far\ntranscending, such an instance as this. The lines of his face had\ndeepened to furrows, and every one of them thanked her visibly. His lips\nmoved to the word ‘Elfride,’ though the emotion evolved no sound. His\neyes passed all description in their combination of the whole diapason\nof eloquence, from lover’s deep love to fellow-man’s gratitude for a\ntoken of remembrance from one of his kind.\n\nElfride had come back. What she had come to do he did not know. She\ncould only look on at his death, perhaps. Still, she had come back, and\nnot deserted him utterly, and it was much.\n\nIt was a novelty in the extreme to see Henry Knight, to whom Elfride\nwas but a child, who had swayed her as a tree sways a bird’s nest, who\nmastered her and made her weep most bitterly at her own insignificance,\nthus thankful for a sight of her face. She looked down upon him, her\nface glistening with rain and tears. He smiled faintly.\n\n‘How calm he is!’ she thought. ‘How great and noble he is to be so\ncalm!’ She would have died ten times for him then.\n\nThe gliding form of the steamboat caught her eye: she heeded it no\nlonger.\n\n‘How much longer can you wait?’ came from her pale lips and along the\nwind to his position.\n\n‘Four minutes,’ said Knight in a weaker voice than her own.\n\n‘But with a good hope of being saved?’\n\n‘Seven or eight.’\n\nHe now noticed that in her arms she bore a bundle of white linen, and\nthat her form was singularly attenuated. So preternaturally thin and\nflexible was Elfride at this moment, that she appeared to bend under the\nlight blows of the rain-shafts, as they struck into her sides and bosom,\nand splintered into spray on her face. There is nothing like a thorough\ndrenching for reducing the protuberances of clothes, but Elfride’s\nseemed to cling to her like a glove.\n\nWithout heeding the attack of the clouds further than by raising her\nhand and wiping away the spirts of rain when they went more particularly\ninto her eyes, she sat down and hurriedly began rending the linen into\nstrips. These she knotted end to end, and afterwards twisted them like\nthe strands of a cord. In a short space of time she had formed a perfect\nrope by this means, six or seven yards long.\n\n‘Can you wait while I bind it?’ she said, anxiously extending her gaze\ndown to him.\n\n‘Yes, if not very long. Hope has given me a wonderful instalment of\nstrength.’\n\nElfride dropped her eyes again, tore the remaining material into narrow\ntape-like ligaments, knotted each to each as before, but on a smaller\nscale, and wound the lengthy string she had thus formed round and round\nthe linen rope, which, without this binding, had a tendency to spread\nabroad.\n\n‘Now,’ said Knight, who, watching the proceedings intently, had by this\ntime not only grasped her scheme, but reasoned further on, ‘I can\nhold three minutes longer yet. And do you use the time in testing the\nstrength of the knots, one by one.’\n\nShe at once obeyed, tested each singly by putting her foot on the rope\nbetween each knot, and pulling with her hands. One of the knots slipped.\n\n‘Oh, think! It would have broken but for your forethought,’ Elfride\nexclaimed apprehensively.\n\nShe retied the two ends. The rope was now firm in every part.\n\n‘When you have let it down,’ said Knight, already resuming his position\nof ruling power, ‘go back from the edge of the slope, and over the bank\nas far as the rope will allow you. Then lean down, and hold the end with\nboth hands.’\n\nHe had first thought of a safer plan for his own deliverance, but it\ninvolved the disadvantage of possibly endangering her life.\n\n‘I have tied it round my waist,’ she cried, ‘and I will lean directly\nupon the bank, holding with my hands as well.’\n\nIt was the arrangement he had thought of, but would not suggest.\n\n‘I will raise and drop it three times when I am behind the bank,’ she\ncontinued, ‘to signify that I am ready. Take care, oh, take the greatest\ncare, I beg you!’\n\nShe dropped the rope over him, to learn how much of its length it\nwould be necessary to expend on that side of the bank, went back, and\ndisappeared as she had done before.\n\nThe rope was trailing by Knight’s shoulders. In a few moments it\ntwitched three times.\n\nHe waited yet a second or two, then laid hold.\n\nThe incline of this upper portion of the precipice, to the length only\nof a few feet, useless to a climber empty-handed, was invaluable now.\nNot more than half his weight depended entirely on the linen rope. Half\na dozen extensions of the arms, alternating with half a dozen seizures\nof the rope with his feet, brought him up to the level of the soil.\n\nHe was saved, and by Elfride.\n\nHe extended his cramped limbs like an awakened sleeper, and sprang over\nthe bank.\n\nAt sight of him she leapt to her feet with almost a shriek of joy.\nKnight’s eyes met hers, and with supreme eloquence the glance of each\ntold a long-concealed tale of emotion in that short half-moment. Moved\nby an impulse neither could resist, they ran together and into each\nother’s arms.\n\nAt the moment of embracing, Elfride’s eyes involuntarily flashed towards\nthe Puffin steamboat. It had doubled the point, and was no longer to be\nseen.\n\nAn overwhelming rush of exultation at having delivered the man she\nrevered from one of the most terrible forms of death, shook the gentle\ngirl to the centre of her soul. It merged in a defiance of duty to\nStephen, and a total recklessness as to plighted faith. Every nerve\nof her will was now in entire subjection to her feeling--volition as a\nguiding power had forsaken her. To remain passive, as she remained now,\nencircled by his arms, was a sufficiently complete result--a glorious\ncrown to all the years of her life. Perhaps he was only grateful, and\ndid not love her. No matter: it was infinitely more to be even the slave\nof the greater than the queen of the less. Some such sensation as this,\nthough it was not recognized as a finished thought, raced along the\nimpressionable soul of Elfride.\n\nRegarding their attitude, it was impossible for two persons to go nearer\nto a kiss than went Knight and Elfride during those minutes of impulsive\nembrace in the pelting rain. Yet they did not kiss. Knight’s peculiarity\nof nature was such that it would not allow him to take advantage of the\nunguarded and passionate avowal she had tacitly made.\n\nElfride recovered herself, and gently struggled to be free.\n\nHe reluctantly relinquished her, and then surveyed her from crown to\ntoe. She seemed as small as an infant. He perceived whence she had\nobtained the rope.\n\n‘Elfride, my Elfride!’ he exclaimed in gratified amazement.\n\n‘I must leave you now,’ she said, her face doubling its red, with\nan expression between gladness and shame ‘You follow me, but at some\ndistance.’\n\n‘The rain and wind pierce you through; the chill will kill you. God\nbless you for such devotion! Take my coat and put it on.’\n\n‘No; I shall get warm running.’\n\nElfride had absolutely nothing between her and the weather but her\nexterior robe or ‘costume.’ The door had been made upon a woman’s wit,\nand it had found its way out. Behind the bank, whilst Knight reclined\nupon the dizzy slope waiting for death, she had taken off her whole\nclothing, and replaced only her outer bodice and skirt. Every thread of\nthe remainder lay upon the ground in the form of a woollen and cotton\nrope.\n\n‘I am used to being wet through,’ she added. ‘I have been drenched on\nPansy dozens of times. Good-bye till we meet, clothed and in our right\nminds, by the fireside at home!’\n\nShe then ran off from him through the pelting rain like a hare; or more\nlike a pheasant when, scampering away with a lowered tail, it has a mind\nto fly, but does not. Elfride was soon out of sight.\n\nKnight felt uncomfortably wet and chilled, but glowing with fervour\nnevertheless. He fully appreciated Elfride’s girlish delicacy in\nrefusing his escort in the meagre habiliments she wore, yet felt\nthat necessary abstraction of herself for a short half-hour as a most\ngrievous loss to him.\n\nHe gathered up her knotted and twisted plumage of linen, lace, and\nembroidery work, and laid it across his arm. He noticed on the ground\nan envelope, limp and wet. In endeavouring to restore this to its proper\nshape, he loosened from the envelope a piece of paper it had contained,\nwhich was seized by the wind in falling from Knight’s hand. It was blown\nto the right, blown to the left--it floated to the edge of the cliff and\nover the sea, where it was hurled aloft. It twirled in the air, and then\nflew back over his head.\n\nKnight followed the paper, and secured it. Having done so, he looked to\ndiscover if it had been worth securing.\n\nThe troublesome sheet was a banker’s receipt for two hundred pounds,\nplaced to the credit of Miss Swancourt, which the impractical girl had\ntotally forgotten she carried with her.\n\nKnight folded it as carefully as its moist condition would allow, put it\nin his pocket, and followed Elfride.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXIII\n\n     ‘Should auld acquaintance be forgot?’\n\n\nBy this time Stephen Smith had stepped out upon the quay at Castle\nBoterel, and breathed his native air.\n\nA darker skin, a more pronounced moustache, and an incipient beard, were\nthe chief additions and changes noticeable in his appearance.\n\nIn spite of the falling rain, which had somewhat lessened, he took a\nsmall valise in his hand, and, leaving the remainder of his luggage at\nthe inn, ascended the hills towards East Endelstow. This place lay in\na vale of its own, further inland than the west village, and though so\nnear it, had little of physical feature in common with the latter. East\nEndelstow was more wooded and fertile: it boasted of Lord Luxellian’s\nmansion and park, and was free from those bleak open uplands which lent\nsuch an air of desolation to the vicinage of the coast--always excepting\nthe small valley in which stood the vicarage and Mrs. Swancourt’s old\nhouse, The Crags.\n\nStephen had arrived nearly at the summit of the ridge when the rain\nagain increased its volume, and, looking about for temporary shelter, he\nascended a steep path which penetrated dense hazel bushes in the lower\npart of its course. Further up it emerged upon a ledge immediately over\nthe turnpike-road, and sheltered by an overhanging face of rubble rock,\nwith bushes above. For a reason of his own he made this spot his refuge\nfrom the storm, and turning his face to the left, conned the landscape\nas a book.\n\nHe was overlooking the valley containing Elfride’s residence.\n\nFrom this point of observation the prospect exhibited the peculiarity\nof being either brilliant foreground or the subdued tone of distance, a\nsudden dip in the surface of the country lowering out of sight all the\nintermediate prospect. In apparent contact with the trees and bushes\ngrowing close beside him appeared the distant tract, terminated suddenly\nby the brink of the series of cliffs which culminated in the tall giant\nwithout a name--small and unimportant as here beheld. A leaf on a bough\nat Stephen’s elbow blotted out a whole hill in the contrasting district\nfar away; a green bunch of nuts covered a complete upland there, and the\ngreat cliff itself was outvied by a pigmy crag in the bank hard by him.\nStephen had looked upon these things hundreds of times before to-day,\nbut he had never viewed them with such tenderness as now.\n\nStepping forward in this direction yet a little further, he could see\nthe tower of West Endelstow Church, beneath which he was to meet his\nElfride that night. And at the same time he noticed, coming over the\nhill from the cliffs, a white speck in motion. It seemed first to be a\nsea-gull flying low, but ultimately proved to be a human figure, running\nwith great rapidity. The form flitted on, heedless of the rain which\nhad caused Stephen’s halt in this place, dropped down the heathery hill,\nentered the vale, and was out of sight.\n\nWhilst he meditated upon the meaning of this phenomenon, he was\nsurprised to see swim into his ken from the same point of departure\nanother moving speck, as different from the first as well could be,\ninsomuch that it was perceptible only by its blackness. Slowly and\nregularly it took the same course, and there was not much doubt that\nthis was the form of a man. He, too, gradually descended from the upper\nlevels, and was lost in the valley below.\n\nThe rain had by this time again abated, and Stephen returned to the\nroad. Looking ahead, he saw two men and a cart. They were soon obscured\nby the intervention of a high hedge. Just before they emerged again he\nheard voices in conversation.\n\n‘’A must soon be in the naibourhood, too, if so be he’s a-coming,’\nsaid a tenor tongue, which Stephen instantly recognized as Martin\nCannister’s.\n\n‘’A must ‘a b’lieve,’ said another voice--that of Stephen’s father.\n\nStephen stepped forward, and came before them face to face. His father\nand Martin were walking, dressed in their second best suits, and beside\nthem rambled along a grizzel horse and brightly painted spring-cart.\n\n‘All right, Mr. Cannister; here’s the lost man!’ exclaimed young Smith,\nentering at once upon the old style of greeting. ‘Father, here I am.’\n\n‘All right, my sonny; and glad I be for’t!’ returned John Smith,\noverjoyed to see the young man. ‘How be ye? Well, come along home, and\ndon’t let’s bide out here in the damp. Such weather must be terrible bad\nfor a young chap just come from a fiery nation like Indy; hey, naibour\nCannister?’\n\n‘Trew, trew. And about getting home his traps? Boxes, monstrous bales,\nand noble packages of foreign description, I make no doubt?’\n\n‘Hardly all that,’ said Stephen laughing.\n\n‘We brought the cart, maning to go right on to Castle Boterel afore ye\nlanded,’ said his father. ‘“Put in the horse,” says Martin. “Ay,” says\nI, “so we will;” and did it straightway. Now, maybe, Martin had better\ngo on wi’ the cart for the things, and you and I walk home-along.’\n\n‘And I shall be back a’most as soon as you. Peggy is a pretty step\nstill, though time d’ begin to tell upon her as upon the rest o’ us.’\n\nStephen told Martin where to find his baggage, and then continued his\njourney homeward in the company of his father.\n\n‘Owing to your coming a day sooner than we first expected,’ said John,\n‘you’ll find us in a turk of a mess, sir--“sir,” says I to my own son!\nbut ye’ve gone up so, Stephen. We’ve killed the pig this morning for\nye, thinking ye’d be hungry, and glad of a morsel of fresh mate. And ‘a\nwon’t be cut up till to-night. However, we can make ye a good supper\nof fry, which will chaw up well wi’ a dab o’ mustard and a few nice new\ntaters, and a drop of shilling ale to wash it down. Your mother have\nscrubbed the house through because ye were coming, and dusted all\nthe chimmer furniture, and bought a new basin and jug of a travelling\ncrockery-woman that came to our door, and scoured the cannel-sticks, and\nclaned the winders! Ay, I don’t know what ‘a ha’n’t a done. Never were\nsuch a steer, ‘a b’lieve.’\n\nConversation of this kind and inquiries of Stephen for his mother’s\nwellbeing occupied them for the remainder of the journey. When they\ndrew near the river, and the cottage behind it, they could hear the\nmaster-mason’s clock striking off the bygone hours of the day at\nintervals of a quarter of a minute, during which intervals Stephen’s\nimagination readily pictured his mother’s forefinger wandering round the\ndial in company with the minute-hand.\n\n‘The clock stopped this morning, and your mother in putting en right\nseemingly,’ said his father in an explanatory tone; and they went up the\ngarden to the door.\n\nWhen they had entered, and Stephen had dutifully and warmly greeted his\nmother--who appeared in a cotton dress of a dark-blue ground, covered\nbroadcast with a multitude of new and full moons, stars, and planets,\nwith an occasional dash of a comet-like aspect to diversify the\nscene--the crackle of cart-wheels was heard outside, and Martin\nCannister stamped in at the doorway, in the form of a pair of legs\nbeneath a great box, his body being nowhere visible. When the luggage\nhad been all taken down, and Stephen had gone upstairs to change his\nclothes, Mrs. Smith’s mind seemed to recover a lost thread.\n\n‘Really our clock is not worth a penny,’ she said, turning to it and\nattempting to start the pendulum.\n\n‘Stopped again?’ inquired Martin with commiseration.\n\n‘Yes, sure,’ replied Mrs. Smith; and continued after the manner of\ncertain matrons, to whose tongues the harmony of a subject with a casual\nmood is a greater recommendation than its pertinence to the occasion,\n‘John would spend pounds a year upon the jimcrack old thing, if he\nmight, in having it claned, when at the same time you may doctor it\nyourself as well. “The clock’s stopped again, John,” I say to him.\n“Better have en claned,” says he. There’s five shillings. “That clock\ngrinds again,” I say to en. “Better have en claned,” ‘a says again.\n“That clock strikes wrong, John,” says I. “Better have en claned,” he\ngoes on. The wheels would have been polished to skeletons by this\ntime if I had listened to en, and I assure you we could have bought a\nchainey-faced beauty wi’ the good money we’ve flung away these last ten\nyears upon this old green-faced mortal. And, Martin, you must be wet. My\nson is gone up to change. John is damper than I should like to be,\nbut ‘a calls it nothing. Some of Mrs. Swancourt’s servants have been\nhere--they ran in out of the rain when going for a walk--and I assure\nyou the state of their bonnets was frightful.’\n\n‘How’s the folks? We’ve been over to Castle Boterel, and what wi’\nrunning and stopping out of the storms, my poor head is beyond\neverything! fizz, fizz fizz; ‘tis frying o’ fish from morning to night,’\nsaid a cracked voice in the doorway at this instant.\n\n‘Lord so’s, who’s that?’ said Mrs. Smith, in a private exclamation,\nand turning round saw William Worm, endeavouring to make himself look\npassing civil and friendly by overspreading his face with a large smile\nthat seemed to have no connection with the humour he was in. Behind him\nstood a woman about twice his size, with a large umbrella over her head.\nThis was Mrs. Worm, William’s wife.\n\n‘Come in, William,’ said John Smith. ‘We don’t kill a pig every day.\nAnd you, likewise, Mrs. Worm. I make ye welcome. Since ye left Parson\nSwancourt, William, I don’t see much of ‘ee.’\n\n‘No, for to tell the truth, since I took to the turn-pike-gate line,\nI’ve been out but little, coming to church o’ Sundays not being my duty\nnow, as ‘twas in a parson’s family, you see. However, our boy is able to\nmind the gate now, and I said, says I, “Barbara, let’s call and see John\nSmith.”’\n\n‘I am sorry to hear yer pore head is so bad still.’\n\n‘Ay, I assure you that frying o’ fish is going on for nights and days.\nAnd, you know, sometimes ‘tisn’t only fish, but rashers o’ bacon and\ninions. Ay, I can hear the fat pop and fizz as nateral as life; can’t I,\nBarbara?’\n\nMrs. Worm, who had been all this time engaged in closing her umbrella,\ncorroborated this statement, and now, coming indoors, showed herself to\nbe a wide-faced, comfortable-looking woman, with a wart upon her cheek,\nbearing a small tuft of hair in its centre.\n\n‘Have ye ever tried anything to cure yer noise, Maister Worm?’ inquired\nMartin Cannister.\n\n‘Oh ay; bless ye, I’ve tried everything. Ay, Providence is a merciful\nman, and I have hoped He’d have found it out by this time, living so\nmany years in a parson’s family, too, as I have, but ‘a don’t seem to\nrelieve me. Ay, I be a poor wambling man, and life’s a mint o’ trouble!’\n\n‘True, mournful true, William Worm. ‘Tis so. The world wants looking to,\nor ‘tis all sixes and sevens wi’ us.’\n\n‘Take your things off, Mrs. Worm,’ said Mrs. Smith. ‘We be rather in a\nmuddle, to tell the truth, for my son is just dropped in from Indy a day\nsooner than we expected, and the pig-killer is coming presently to cut\nup.’\n\nMrs. Barbara Worm, not wishing to take any mean advantage of persons\nin a muddle by observing them, removed her bonnet and mantle with eyes\nfixed upon the flowers in the plot outside the door.\n\n‘What beautiful tiger-lilies!’ said Mrs. Worm.\n\n‘Yes, they be very well, but such a trouble to me on account of the\nchildren that come here. They will go eating the berries on the stem,\nand call ‘em currants. Taste wi’ junivals is quite fancy, really.’\n\n‘And your snapdragons look as fierce as ever.’\n\n‘Well, really,’ answered Mrs. Smith, entering didactically into the\nsubject, ‘they are more like Christians than flowers. But they make up\nwell enough wi’ the rest, and don’t require much tending. And the same\ncan be said o’ these miller’s wheels. ‘Tis a flower I like very much,\nthough so simple. John says he never cares about the flowers o’ ‘em,\nbut men have no eye for anything neat. He says his favourite flower is\na cauliflower. And I assure you I tremble in the springtime, for ‘tis\nperfect murder.’\n\n‘You don’t say so, Mrs. Smith!’\n\n‘John digs round the roots, you know. In goes his blundering spade,\nthrough roots, bulbs, everything that hasn’t got a good show above\nground, turning ‘em up cut all to slices. Only the very last fall I went\nto move some tulips, when I found every bulb upside down, and the stems\ncrooked round. He had turned ‘em over in the spring, and the cunning\ncreatures had soon found that heaven was not where it used to be.’\n\n‘What’s that long-favoured flower under the hedge?’\n\n‘They? O Lord, they are the horrid Jacob’s ladders! Instead of praising\n‘em, I be mad wi’ ‘em for being so ready to bide where they are not\nwanted. They be very well in their way, but I do not care for things\nthat neglect won’t kill. Do what I will, dig, drag, scrap, pull, I get\ntoo many of ‘em. I chop the roots: up they’ll come, treble strong. Throw\n‘em over hedge; there they’ll grow, staring me in the face like a hungry\ndog driven away, and creep back again in a week or two the same as\nbefore. ‘Tis Jacob’s ladder here, Jacob’s ladder there, and plant ‘em\nwhere nothing in the world will grow, you get crowds of ‘em in a month\nor two. John made a new manure mixen last summer, and he said, “Maria,\nnow if you’ve got any flowers or such like, that you don’t want, you may\nplant ‘em round my mixen so as to hide it a bit, though ‘tis not likely\nanything of much value will grow there.” I thought, “There’s them\nJacob’s ladders; I’ll put them there, since they can’t do harm in such a\nplace;” and I planted the Jacob’s ladders sure enough. They growed, and\nthey growed, in the mixen and out of the mixen, all over the litter,\ncovering it quite up. When John wanted to use it about the garden, ‘a\nsaid, “Nation seize them Jacob’s ladders of yours, Maria! They’ve eat\nthe goodness out of every morsel of my manure, so that ‘tis no better\nthan sand itself!” Sure enough the hungry mortals had. ‘Tis my belief\nthat in the secret souls o’ ‘em, Jacob’s ladders be weeds, and not\nflowers at all, if the truth was known.’\n\nRobert Lickpan, pig-killer and carrier, arrived at this moment. The\nfatted animal hanging in the back kitchen was cleft down the middle of\nits backbone, Mrs. Smith being meanwhile engaged in cooking supper.\n\nBetween the cutting and chopping, ale was handed round, and Worm and\nthe pig-killer listened to John Smith’s description of the meeting with\nStephen, with eyes blankly fixed upon the table-cloth, in order that\nnothing in the external world should interrupt their efforts to conjure\nup the scene correctly.\n\nStephen came downstairs in the middle of the story, and after the little\ninterruption occasioned by his entrance and welcome, the narrative was\nagain continued, precisely as if he had not been there at all, and\nwas told inclusively to him, as to somebody who knew nothing about the\nmatter.\n\n‘“Ay,” I said, as I catched sight o’ en through the brimbles, “that’s\nthe lad, for I d’ know en by his grand-father’s walk;” for ‘a stapped\nout like poor father for all the world. Still there was a touch o’ the\nfrisky that set me wondering. ‘A got closer, and I said, “That’s the\nlad, for I d’ know en by his carrying a black case like a travelling\nman.” Still, a road is common to all the world, and there be more\ntravelling men than one. But I kept my eye cocked, and I said to Martin,\n“‘Tis the boy, now, for I d’ know en by the wold twirl o’ the stick and\nthe family step.” Then ‘a come closer, and a’ said, “All right.” I could\nswear to en then.’\n\nStephen’s personal appearance was next criticised.\n\n‘He d’ look a deal thinner in face, surely, than when I seed en at the\nparson’s, and never knowed en, if ye’ll believe me,’ said Martin.\n\n‘Ay, there,’ said another, without removing his eyes from Stephen’s\nface, ‘I should ha’ knowed en anywhere. ‘Tis his father’s nose to a T.’\n\n‘It has been often remarked,’ said Stephen modestly.\n\n‘And he’s certainly taller,’ said Martin, letting his glance run over\nStephen’s form from bottom to top.\n\n‘I was thinking ‘a was exactly the same height,’ Worm replied.\n\n‘Bless thy soul, that’s because he’s bigger round likewise.’ And the\nunited eyes all moved to Stephen’s waist.\n\n‘I be a poor wambling man, but I can make allowances,’ said William\nWorm. ‘Ah, sure, and how he came as a stranger and pilgrim to Parson\nSwancourt’s that time, not a soul knowing en after so many years! Ay,\nlife’s a strange picter, Stephen: but I suppose I must say Sir to ye?’\n\n‘Oh, it is not necessary at present,’ Stephen replied, though mentally\nresolving to avoid the vicinity of that familiar friend as soon as he\nhad made pretensions to the hand of Elfride.\n\n‘Ah, well,’ said Worm musingly, ‘some would have looked for no less than\na Sir. There’s a sight of difference in people.’\n\n‘And in pigs likewise,’ observed John Smith, looking at the halved\ncarcass of his own.\n\nRobert Lickpan, the pig-killer, here seemed called upon to enter the\nlists of conversation.\n\n‘Yes, they’ve got their particular naters good-now,’ he remarked\ninitially. ‘Many’s the rum-tempered pig I’ve knowed.’\n\n‘I don’t doubt it, Master Lickpan,’ answered Martin, in a tone\nexpressing that his convictions, no less than good manners, demanded the\nreply.\n\n‘Yes,’ continued the pig-killer, as one accustomed to be heard. ‘One\nthat I knowed was deaf and dumb, and we couldn’t make out what was the\nmatter wi’ the pig. ‘A would eat well enough when ‘a seed the trough,\nbut when his back was turned, you might a-rattled the bucket all day,\nthe poor soul never heard ye. Ye could play tricks upon en behind his\nback, and a’ wouldn’t find it out no quicker than poor deaf Grammer\nCates. But a’ fatted well, and I never seed a pig open better when a’\nwas killed, and ‘a was very tender eating, very; as pretty a bit of mate\nas ever you see; you could suck that mate through a quill.\n\n‘And another I knowed,’ resumed the killer, after quietly letting a pint\nof ale run down his throat of its own accord, and setting down the\ncup with mathematical exactness upon the spot from which he had raised\nit--‘another went out of his mind.’\n\n‘How very mournful!’ murmured Mrs. Worm.\n\n‘Ay, poor thing, ‘a did! As clean out of his mind as the cleverest\nChristian could go. In early life ‘a was very melancholy, and never\nseemed a hopeful pig by no means. ‘Twas Andrew Stainer’s pig--that’s\nwhose pig ‘twas.’\n\n‘I can mind the pig well enough,’ attested John Smith.\n\n‘And a pretty little porker ‘a was. And you all know Farmer Buckle’s\nsort? Every jack o’ em suffer from the rheumatism to this day, owing to\na damp sty they lived in when they were striplings, as ‘twere.’\n\n‘Well, now we’ll weigh,’ said John.\n\n‘If so be he were not so fine, we’d weigh en whole: but as he is, we’ll\ntake a side at a time. John, you can mind my old joke, ey?’\n\n‘I do so; though ‘twas a good few years ago I first heard en.’\n\n‘Yes,’ said Lickpan, ‘that there old familiar joke have been in our\nfamily for generations, I may say. My father used that joke regular at\npig-killings for more than five and forty years--the time he followed\nthe calling. And ‘a told me that ‘a had it from his father when he was\nquite a chiel, who made use o’ en just the same at every killing more or\nless; and pig-killings were pig-killings in those days.’\n\n‘Trewly they were.’\n\n‘I’ve never heard the joke,’ said Mrs. Smith tentatively.\n\n‘Nor I,’ chimed in Mrs. Worm, who, being the only other lady in the\nroom, felt bound by the laws of courtesy to feel like Mrs. Smith in\neverything.\n\n‘Surely, surely you have,’ said the killer, looking sceptically at the\nbenighted females. ‘However, ‘tisn’t much--I don’t wish to say it is. It\ncommences like this: “Bob will tell the weight of your pig, ‘a b’lieve,”\n says I. The congregation of neighbours think I mane my son Bob,\nnaturally; but the secret is that I mane the bob o’ the steelyard. Ha,\nha, ha!’\n\n‘Haw, haw, haw!’ laughed Martin Cannister, who had heard the explanation\nof this striking story for the hundredth time.\n\n‘Huh, huh, huh!’ laughed John Smith, who had heard it for the\nthousandth.\n\n‘Hee, hee, hee!’ laughed William Worm, who had never heard it at all,\nbut was afraid to say so.\n\n‘Thy grandfather, Robert, must have been a wide-awake chap to make that\nstory,’ said Martin Cannister, subsiding to a placid aspect of delighted\ncriticism.\n\n‘He had a head, by all account. And, you see, as the first-born of the\nLickpans have all been Roberts, they’ve all been Bobs, so the story was\nhanded down to the present day.’\n\n‘Poor Joseph, your second boy, will never be able to bring it out in\ncompany, which is rather unfortunate,’ said Mrs. Worm thoughtfully.\n\n‘’A won’t. Yes, grandfer was a clever chap, as ye say; but I knowed a\ncleverer. ‘Twas my uncle Levi. Uncle Levi made a snuff-box that should\nbe a puzzle to his friends to open. He used to hand en round at wedding\nparties, christenings, funerals, and in other jolly company, and let ‘em\ntry their skill. This extraordinary snuff-box had a spring behind that\nwould push in and out--a hinge where seemed to be the cover; a slide at\nthe end, a screw in front, and knobs and queer notches everywhere. One\nman would try the spring, another would try the screw, another would\ntry the slide; but try as they would, the box wouldn’t open. And they\ncouldn’t open en, and they didn’t open en. Now what might you think was\nthe secret of that box?’\n\nAll put on an expression that their united thoughts were inadequate to\nthe occasion.\n\n‘Why the box wouldn’t open at all. ‘A were made not to open, and ye\nmight have tried till the end of Revelations, ‘twould have been as\nnaught, for the box were glued all round.’\n\n‘A very deep man to have made such a box.’\n\n‘Yes. ‘Twas like uncle Levi all over.’\n\n‘’Twas. I can mind the man very well. Tallest man ever I seed.’\n\n‘’A was so. He never slept upon a bedstead after he growed up a hard\nboy-chap--never could get one long enough. When ‘a lived in that little\nsmall house by the pond, he used to have to leave open his chamber door\nevery night at going to his bed, and let his feet poke out upon the\nlanding.’\n\n‘He’s dead and gone now, nevertheless, poor man, as we all shall,’\nobserved Worm, to fill the pause which followed the conclusion of Robert\nLickpan’s speech.\n\nThe weighing and cutting up was pursued amid an animated discourse on\nStephen’s travels; and at the finish, the first-fruits of the day’s\nslaughter, fried in onions, were then turned from the pan into a dish\non the table, each piece steaming and hissing till it reached their very\nmouths.\n\nIt must be owned that the gentlemanly son of the house looked rather\nout of place in the course of this operation. Nor was his mind\nquite philosophic enough to allow him to be comfortable with these\nold-established persons, his father’s friends. He had never lived long\nat home--scarcely at all since his childhood. The presence of William\nWorm was the most awkward feature of the case, for, though Worm had left\nthe house of Mr. Swancourt, the being hand-in-glove with a ci-devant\nservitor reminded Stephen too forcibly of the vicar’s classification\nof himself before he went from England. Mrs. Smith was conscious of\nthe defect in her arrangements which had brought about the undesired\nconjunction. She spoke to Stephen privately.\n\n‘I am above having such people here, Stephen; but what could I do? And\nyour father is so rough in his nature that he’s more mixed up with them\nthan need be.’\n\n‘Never mind, mother,’ said Stephen; ‘I’ll put up with it now.’\n\n‘When we leave my lord’s service, and get further up the country--as\nI hope we shall soon--it will be different. We shall be among fresh\npeople, and in a larger house, and shall keep ourselves up a bit, I\nhope.’\n\n‘Is Miss Swancourt at home, do you know?’ Stephen inquired\n\n‘Yes, your father saw her this morning.’\n\n‘Do you often see her?’\n\n‘Scarcely ever. Mr. Glim, the curate, calls occasionally, but the\nSwancourts don’t come into the village now any more than to drive\nthrough it. They dine at my lord’s oftener than they used. Ah, here’s a\nnote was brought this morning for you by a boy.’\n\nStephen eagerly took the note and opened it, his mother watching him. He\nread what Elfride had written and sent before she started for the cliff\nthat afternoon:\n\n\n‘Yes; I will meet you in the church at nine to-night.--E. S.’\n\n\n‘I don’t know, Stephen,’ his mother said meaningly, ‘whe’r you still\nthink about Miss Elfride, but if I were you I wouldn’t concern about\nher. They say that none of old Mrs. Swancourt’s money will come to her\nstep-daughter.’\n\n‘I see the evening has turned out fine; I am going out for a little\nwhile to look round the place,’ he said, evading the direct query.\n‘Probably by the time I return our visitors will be gone, and we’ll have\na more confidential talk.’\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXIV\n\n     ‘Breeze, bird, and flower confess the hour.’\n\n\nThe rain had ceased since the sunset, but it was a cloudy night; and\nthe light of the moon, softened and dispersed by its misty veil, was\ndistributed over the land in pale gray.\n\nA dark figure stepped from the doorway of John Smith’s river-side\ncottage, and strode rapidly towards West Endelstow with a light\nfootstep. Soon ascending from the lower levels he turned a corner,\nfollowed a cart-track, and saw the tower of the church he was in quest\nof distinctly shaped forth against the sky. In less than half an hour\nfrom the time of starting he swung himself over the churchyard stile.\n\nThe wild irregular enclosure was as much as ever an integral part of the\nold hill. The grass was still long, the graves were shaped precisely as\npassing years chose to alter them from their orthodox form as laid down\nby Martin Cannister, and by Stephen’s own grandfather before him.\n\nA sound sped into the air from the direction in which Castle Boterel\nlay. It was the striking of the church clock, distinct in the still\natmosphere as if it had come from the tower hard by, which, wrapt in its\nsolitary silentness, gave out no such sounds of life.\n\n‘One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.’ Stephen\ncarefully counted the strokes, though he well knew their number\nbeforehand. Nine o’clock. It was the hour Elfride had herself named as\nthe most convenient for meeting him.\n\nStephen stood at the door of the porch and listened. He could have heard\nthe softest breathing of any person within the porch; nobody was there.\nHe went inside the doorway, sat down upon the stone bench, and waited\nwith a beating heart.\n\nThe faint sounds heard only accentuated the silence. The rising and\nfalling of the sea, far away along the coast, was the most important.\nA minor sound was the scurr of a distant night-hawk. Among the minutest\nwhere all were minute were the light settlement of gossamer fragments\nfloating in the air, a toad humbly labouring along through the\ngrass near the entrance, the crackle of a dead leaf which a worm was\nendeavouring to pull into the earth, a waft of air, getting nearer and\nnearer, and expiring at his feet under the burden of a winged seed.\n\nAmong all these soft sounds came not the only soft sound he cared to\nhear--the footfall of Elfride.\n\nFor a whole quarter of an hour Stephen sat thus intent, without moving\na muscle. At the end of that time he walked to the west front of the\nchurch. Turning the corner of the tower, a white form stared him in the\nface. He started back, and recovered himself. It was the tomb of young\nfarmer Jethway, looking still as fresh and as new as when it was\nfirst erected, the white stone in which it was hewn having a singular\nweirdness amid the dark blue slabs from local quarries, of which the\nwhole remaining gravestones were formed.\n\nHe thought of the night when he had sat thereon with Elfride as his\ncompanion, and well remembered his regret that she had received, even\nunwillingly, earlier homage than his own. But his present tangible\nanxiety reduced such a feeling to sentimental nonsense in comparison;\nand he strolled on over the graves to the border of the churchyard,\nwhence in the daytime could be clearly seen the vicarage and the present\nresidence of the Swancourts. No footstep was discernible upon the path\nup the hill, but a light was shining from a window in the last-named\nhouse.\n\nStephen knew there could be no mistake about the time or place, and no\ndifficulty about keeping the engagement. He waited yet longer, passing\nfrom impatience into a mood which failed to take any account of the\nlapse of time. He was awakened from his reverie by Castle Boterel clock.\n\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, TEN.\n\nOne little fall of the hammer in addition to the number it had been\nsharp pleasure to hear, and what a difference to him!\n\nHe left the churchyard on the side opposite to his point of entrance,\nand went down the hill. Slowly he drew near the gate of her house. This\nhe softly opened, and walked up the gravel drive to the door. Here he\npaused for several minutes.\n\nAt the expiration of that time the murmured speech of a manly voice came\nout to his ears through an open window behind the corner of the house.\nThis was responded to by a clear soft laugh. It was the laugh of\nElfride.\n\nStephen was conscious of a gnawing pain at his heart. He retreated as he\nhad come. There are disappointments which wring us, and there are those\nwhich inflict a wound whose mark we bear to our graves. Such are so\nkeen that no future gratification of the same desire can ever obliterate\nthem: they become registered as a permanent loss of happiness. Such a\none was Stephen’s now: the crowning aureola of the dream had been the\nmeeting here by stealth; and if Elfride had come to him only ten\nminutes after he had turned away, the disappointment would have been\nrecognizable still.\n\nWhen the young man reached home he found there a letter which had\narrived in his absence. Believing it to contain some reason for her\nnon-appearance, yet unable to imagine one that could justify her, he\nhastily tore open the envelope.\n\nThe paper contained not a word from Elfride. It was the deposit-note for\nhis two hundred pounds. On the back was the form of a cheque, and this\nshe had filled up with the same sum, payable to the bearer.\n\nStephen was confounded. He attempted to divine her motive. Considering\nhow limited was his knowledge of her later actions, he guessed rather\nshrewdly that, between the time of her sending the note in the morning\nand the evening’s silent refusal of his gift, something had occurred\nwhich had caused a total change in her attitude towards him.\n\nHe knew not what to do. It seemed absurd now to go to her father next\nmorning, as he had purposed, and ask for an engagement with her, a\npossibility impending all the while that Elfride herself would not be\non his side. Only one course recommended itself as wise. To wait and see\nwhat the days would bring forth; to go and execute his commissions in\nBirmingham; then to return, learn if anything had happened, and try what\na meeting might do; perhaps her surprise at his backwardness would bring\nher forward to show latent warmth as decidedly as in old times.\n\nThis act of patience was in keeping only with the nature of a man\nprecisely of Stephen’s constitution. Nine men out of ten would perhaps\nhave rushed off, got into her presence, by fair means or foul, and\nprovoked a catastrophe of some sort. Possibly for the better, probably\nfor the worse.\n\nHe started for Birmingham the next morning. A day’s delay would have\nmade no difference; but he could not rest until he had begun and ended\nthe programme proposed to himself. Bodily activity will sometimes take\nthe sting out of anxiety as completely as assurance itself.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXV\n\n     ‘Mine own familiar friend.’\n\n\nDuring these days of absence Stephen lived under alternate conditions.\nWhenever his emotions were active, he was in agony. Whenever he was not\nin agony, the business in hand had driven out of his mind by sheer force\nall deep reflection on the subject of Elfride and love.\n\nBy the time he took his return journey at the week’s end, Stephen had\nvery nearly worked himself up to an intention to call and see her face\nto face. On this occasion also he adopted his favourite route--by the\nlittle summer steamer from Bristol to Castle Boterel; the time saved\nby speed on the railway being wasted at junctions, and in following a\ndevious course.\n\nIt was a bright silent evening at the beginning of September when Smith\nagain set foot in the little town. He felt inclined to linger awhile\nupon the quay before ascending the hills, having formed a romantic\nintention to go home by way of her house, yet not wishing to wander in\nits neighbourhood till the evening shades should sufficiently screen him\nfrom observation.\n\nAnd thus waiting for night’s nearer approach, he watched the placid\nscene, over which the pale luminosity of the west cast a sorrowful\nmonochrome, that became slowly embrowned by the dusk. A star appeared,\nand another, and another. They sparkled amid the yards and rigging\nof the two coal brigs lying alangside, as if they had been tiny lamps\nsuspended in the ropes. The masts rocked sleepily to the infinitesimal\nflux of the tide, which clucked and gurgled with idle regularity in\nnooks and holes of the harbour wall.\n\nThe twilight was now quite pronounced enough for his purpose; and as,\nrather sad at heart, he was about to move on, a little boat containing\ntwo persons glided up the middle of the harbour with the lightness of\na shadow. The boat came opposite him, passed on, and touched the\nlanding-steps at the further end. One of its occupants was a man, as\nStephen had known by the easy stroke of the oars. When the pair ascended\nthe steps, and came into greater prominence, he was enabled to discern\nthat the second personage was a woman; also that she wore a white\ndecoration--apparently a feather--in her hat or bonnet, which spot of\nwhite was the only distinctly visible portion of her clothing.\n\nStephen remained a moment in their rear, and they passed on, when he\npursued his way also, and soon forgot the circumstance. Having crossed\na bridge, forsaken the high road, and entered the footpath which led\nup the vale to West Endelstow, he heard a little wicket click softly\ntogether some yards ahead. By the time that Stephen had reached the\nwicket and passed it, he heard another click of precisely the same\nnature from another gate yet further on. Clearly some person or persons\nwere preceding him along the path, their footsteps being rendered\nnoiseless by the soft carpet of turf. Stephen now walked a little\nquicker, and perceived two forms. One of them bore aloft the white\nfeather he had noticed in the woman’s hat on the quay: they were the\ncouple he had seen in the boat. Stephen dropped a little further to the\nrear.\n\nFrom the bottom of the valley, along which the path had hitherto lain,\nbeside the margin of the trickling streamlet, another path now diverged,\nand ascended the slope of the left-hand hill. This footway led only to\nthe residence of Mrs. Swancourt and a cottage or two in its vicinity. No\ngrass covered this diverging path in portions of its length, and Stephen\nwas reminded that the pair in front of him had taken this route by the\noccasional rattle of loose stones under their feet. Stephen climbed in\nthe same direction, but for some undefined reason he trod more softly\nthan did those preceding him. His mind was unconsciously in exercise\nupon whom the woman might be--whether a visitor to The Crags, a servant,\nor Elfride. He put it to himself yet more forcibly; could the lady be\nElfride? A possible reason for her unaccountable failure to keep the\nappointment with him returned with painful force.\n\nThey entered the grounds of the house by the side wicket, whence\nthe path, now wide and well trimmed, wound fantastically through the\nshrubbery to an octagonal pavilion called the Belvedere, by reason of\nthe comprehensive view over the adjacent district that its green seats\nafforded. The path passed this erection and went on to the house as well\nas to the gardener’s cottage on the other side, straggling thence\nto East Endelstow; so that Stephen felt no hesitation in entering a\npromenade which could scarcely be called private.\n\nHe fancied that he heard the gate open and swing together again behind\nhim. Turning, he saw nobody.\n\nThe people of the boat came to the summer-house. One of them spoke.\n\n‘I am afraid we shall get a scolding for being so late.’\n\nStephen instantly recognised the familiar voice, richer and fuller now\nthan it used to be. ‘Elfride!’ he whispered to himself, and held fast\nby a sapling, to steady himself under the agitation her presence caused\nhim. His heart swerved from its beat; he shunned receiving the meaning\nhe sought.\n\n‘A breeze is rising again; how the ash tree rustles!’ said Elfride.\n‘Don’t you hear it? I wonder what the time is.’\n\nStephen relinquished the sapling.\n\n‘I will get a light and tell you. Step into the summer-house; the air is\nquiet there.’\n\nThe cadence of that voice--its peculiarity seemed to come home to him\nlike that of some notes of the northern birds on his return to his\nnative clime, as an old natural thing renewed, yet not particularly\nnoticed as natural before that renewal.\n\nThey entered the Belvedere. In the lower part it was formed of close\nwood-work nailed crosswise, and had openings in the upper by way of\nwindows.\n\nThe scratch of a striking light was heard, and a bright glow radiated\nfrom the interior of the building. The light gave birth to dancing\nleaf-shadows, stem-shadows, lustrous streaks, dots, sparkles, and\nthreads of silver sheen of all imaginable variety and transience. It\nawakened gnats, which flew towards it, revealed shiny gossamer threads,\ndisturbed earthworms. Stephen gave but little attention to these\nphenomena, and less time. He saw in the summer-house a strongly\nilluminated picture.\n\nFirst, the face of his friend and preceptor Henry Knight, between whom\nand himself an estrangement had arisen, not from any definite causes\nbeyond those of absence, increasing age, and diverging sympathies.\n\nNext, his bright particular star, Elfride. The face of Elfride was more\nwomanly than when she had called herself his, but as clear and healthy\nas ever. Her plenteous twines of beautiful hair were looking much as\nusual, with the exception of a slight modification in their arrangement\nin deference to the changes of fashion.\n\nTheir two foreheads were close together, almost touching, and both were\nlooking down. Elfride was holding her watch, Knight was holding the\nlight with one hand, his left arm being round her waist. Part of the\nscene reached Stephen’s eyes through the horizontal bars of woodwork,\nwhich crossed their forms like the ribs of a skeleton.\n\nKnight’s arm stole still further round the waist of Elfride.\n\n‘It is half-past eight,’ she said in a low voice, which had a peculiar\nmusic in it, seemingly born of a thrill of pleasure at the new proof\nthat she was beloved.\n\nThe flame dwindled down, died away, and all was wrapped in a darkness to\nwhich the gloom before the illumination bore no comparison in apparent\ndensity. Stephen, shattered in spirit and sick to his heart’s\ncentre, turned away. In turning, he saw a shadowy outline behind\nthe summer-house on the other side. His eyes grew accustomed to the\ndarkness. Was the form a human form, or was it an opaque bush of\njuniper?\n\nThe lovers arose, brushed against the laurestines, and pursued their\nway to the house. The indistinct figure had moved, and now passed across\nSmith’s front. So completely enveloped was the person, that it was\nimpossible to discern him or her any more than as a shape. The shape\nglided noiselessly on.\n\nStephen stepped forward, fearing any mischief was intended to the other\ntwo. ‘Who are you?’ he said.\n\n‘Never mind who I am,’ answered a weak whisper from the enveloping\nfolds. ‘WHAT I am, may she be! Perhaps I knew well--ah, so well!--a\nyouth whose place you took, as he there now takes yours. Will you let\nher break your heart, and bring you to an untimely grave, as she did the\none before you?’\n\n‘You are Mrs. Jethway, I think. What do you do here? And why do you talk\nso wildly?’\n\n‘Because my heart is desolate, and nobody cares about it. May hers be so\nthat brought trouble upon me!’\n\n‘Silence!’ said Stephen, staunch to Elfride in spite of himself. ‘She\nwould harm nobody wilfully, never would she! How do you come here?’\n\n‘I saw the two coming up the path, and wanted to learn if she were not\none of them. Can I help disliking her if I think of the past? Can I\nhelp watching her if I remember my boy? Can I help ill-wishing her if I\nwell-wish him?’\n\nThe bowed form went on, passed through the wicket, and was enveloped by\nthe shadows of the field.\n\nStephen had heard that Mrs. Jethway, since the death of her son, had\nbecome a crazed, forlorn woman; and bestowing a pitying thought\nupon her, he dismissed her fancied wrongs from his mind, but not her\ncondemnation of Elfride’s faithlessness. That entered into and mingled\nwith the sensations his new experience had begotten. The tale told by\nthe little scene he had witnessed ran parallel with the unhappy woman’s\nopinion, which, however baseless it might have been antecedently, had\nbecome true enough as regarded himself.\n\nA slow weight of despair, as distinct from a violent paroxysm as\nstarvation from a mortal shot, filled him and wrung him body and soul.\nThe discovery had not been altogether unexpected, for throughout his\nanxiety of the last few days since the night in the churchyard, he had\nbeen inclined to construe the uncertainty unfavourably for himself. His\nhopes for the best had been but periodic interruptions to a chronic fear\nof the worst.\n\nA strange concomitant of his misery was the singularity of its form.\nThat his rival should be Knight, whom once upon a time he had adored\nas a man is very rarely adored by another in modern times, and whom\nhe loved now, added deprecation to sorrow, and cynicism to both. Henry\nKnight, whose praises he had so frequently trumpeted in her ears, of\nwhom she had actually been jealous, lest she herself should be lessened\nin Stephen’s love on account of him, had probably won her the more\neasily by reason of those very praises which he had only ceased to utter\nby her command. She had ruled him like a queen in that matter, as in\nall others. Stephen could tell by her manner, brief as had been his\nobservation of it, and by her words, few as they were, that her position\nwas far different with Knight. That she looked up at and adored her new\nlover from below his pedestal, was even more perceptible than that she\nhad smiled down upon Stephen from a height above him.\n\nThe suddenness of Elfride’s renunciation of himself was food for more\ntorture. To an unimpassioned outsider, it admitted of at least two\ninterpretations--it might either have proceeded from an endeavour to be\nfaithful to her first choice, till the lover seen absolutely overpowered\nthe lover remembered, or from a wish not to lose his love till sure of\nthe love of another. But to Stephen Smith the motive involved in the\nlatter alternative made it untenable where Elfride was the actor.\n\nHe mused on her letters to him, in which she had never mentioned a\nsyllable concerning Knight. It is desirable, however, to observe that\nonly in two letters could she possibly have done so. One was written\nabout a week before Knight’s arrival, when, though she did not mention\nhis promised coming to Stephen, she had hardly a definite reason in her\nmind for neglecting to do it. In the next she did casually allude to\nKnight. But Stephen had left Bombay long before that letter arrived.\n\nStephen looked at the black form of the adjacent house, where it cut a\ndark polygonal notch out of the sky, and felt that he hated the spot.\nHe did not know many facts of the case, but could not help instinctively\nassociating Elfride’s fickleness with the marriage of her father, and\ntheir introduction to London society. He closed the iron gate bounding\nthe shrubbery as noiselessly as he had opened it, and went into the\ngrassy field. Here he could see the old vicarage, the house alone that\nwas associated with the sweet pleasant time of his incipient love for\nElfride. Turning sadly from the place that was no longer a nook in\nwhich his thoughts might nestle when he was far away, he wandered in the\ndirection of the east village, to reach his father’s house before they\nretired to rest.\n\nThe nearest way to the cottage was by crossing the park. He did not\nhurry. Happiness frequently has reason for haste, but it is seldom\nthat desolation need scramble or strain. Sometimes he paused under the\nlow-hanging arms of the trees, looking vacantly on the ground.\n\nStephen was standing thus, scarcely less crippled in thought than he was\nblank in vision, when a clear sound permeated the quiet air about him,\nand spread on far beyond. The sound was the stroke of a bell from the\ntower of East Endelstow Church, which stood in a dell not forty yards\nfrom Lord Luxellian’s mansion, and within the park enclosure. Another\nstroke greeted his ear, and gave character to both: then came a slow\nsuccession of them.\n\n‘Somebody is dead,’ he said aloud.\n\nThe death-knell of an inhabitant of the eastern parish was being tolled.\n\nAn unusual feature in the tolling was that it had not been begun\naccording to the custom in Endelstow and other parishes in the\nneighbourhood. At every death the sex and age of the deceased were\nannounced by a system of changes. Three times three strokes signified\nthat the departed one was a man; three times two, a woman; twice\nthree, a boy; twice two, a girl. The regular continuity of the tolling\nsuggested that it was the resumption rather than the beginning of a\nknell--the opening portion of which Stephen had not been near enough to\nhear.\n\nThe momentary anxiety he had felt with regard to his parents passed\naway. He had left them in perfect health, and had any serious illness\nseized either, a communication would have reached him ere this. At the\nsame time, since his way homeward lay under the churchyard yews, he\nresolved to look into the belfry in passing by, and speak a word to\nMartin Cannister, who would be there.\n\nStephen reached the brow of the hill, and felt inclined to renounce his\nidea. His mood was such that talking to any person to whom he could not\nunburden himself would be wearisome. However, before he could put any\ninclination into effect, the young man saw from amid the trees a bright\nlight shining, the rays from which radiated like needles through the\nsad plumy foliage of the yews. Its direction was from the centre of the\nchurchyard.\n\nStephen mechanically went forward. Never could there be a greater\ncontrast between two places of like purpose than between this graveyard\nand that of the further village. Here the grass was carefully tended,\nand formed virtually a part of the manor-house lawn; flowers and shrubs\nbeing planted indiscriminately over both, whilst the few graves visible\nwere mathematically exact in shape and smoothness, appearing in the\ndaytime like chins newly shaven. There was no wall, the division between\nGod’s Acre and Lord Luxellian’s being marked only by a few square\nstones set at equidistant points. Among those persons who have romantic\nsentiments on the subject of their last dwelling-place, probably the\ngreater number would have chosen such a spot as this in preference to\nany other: a few would have fancied a constraint in its trim neatness,\nand would have preferred the wild hill-top of the neighbouring site,\nwith Nature in her most negligent attire.\n\nThe light in the churchyard he next discovered to have its source in a\npoint very near the ground, and Stephen imagined it might come from a\nlantern in the interior of a partly-dug grave. But a nearer approach\nshowed him that its position was immediately under the wall of the\naisle, and within the mouth of an archway. He could now hear voices, and\nthe truth of the whole matter began to dawn upon him. Walking on towards\nthe opening, Smith discerned on his left hand a heap of earth,\nand before him a flight of stone steps which the removed earth had\nuncovered, leading down under the edifice. It was the entrance to a\nlarge family vault, extending under the north aisle.\n\nStephen had never before seen it open, and descending one or two steps\nstooped to look under the arch. The vault appeared to be crowded with\ncoffins, with the exception of an open central space, which had been\nnecessarily kept free for ingress and access to the sides, round three\nof which the coffins were stacked in stone bins or niches.\n\nThe place was well lighted with candles stuck in slips of wood that were\nfastened to the wall. On making the descent of another step the living\ninhabitants of the vault were recognizable. They were his father the\nmaster-mason, an under-mason, Martin Cannister, and two or three young\nand old labouring-men. Crowbars and workmen’s hammers were scattered\nabout. The whole company, sitting round on coffins which had been\nremoved from their places, apparently for some alteration or enlargement\nof the vault, were eating bread and cheese, and drinking ale from a cup\nwith two handles, passed round from each to each.\n\n‘Who is dead?’ Stephen inquired, stepping down.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXVI\n\n     ‘To that last nothing under earth.’\n\n\nAll eyes were turned to the entrance as Stephen spoke, and the\nancient-mannered conclave scrutinized him inquiringly.\n\n‘Why, ‘tis our Stephen!’ said his father, rising from his seat; and,\nstill retaining the frothy mug in his left hand, he swung forward his\nright for a grasp. ‘Your mother is expecting ye--thought you would have\ncome afore dark. But you’ll wait and go home with me? I have all but\ndone for the day, and was going directly.’\n\n‘Yes, ‘tis Master Stephy, sure enough. Glad to see you so soon again,\nMaster Smith,’ said Martin Cannister, chastening the gladness expressed\nin his words by a strict neutrality of countenance, in order to\nharmonize the feeling as much as possible with the solemnity of a family\nvault.\n\n‘The same to you, Martin; and you, William,’ said Stephen, nodding\naround to the rest, who, having their mouths full of bread and cheese,\nwere of necessity compelled to reply merely by compressing their eyes to\nfriendly lines and wrinkles.\n\n‘And who is dead?’ Stephen repeated.\n\n‘Lady Luxellian, poor gentlewoman, as we all shall, said the\nunder-mason. ‘Ay, and we be going to enlarge the vault to make room for\nher.’\n\n‘When did she die?’\n\n‘Early this morning,’ his father replied, with an appearance of\nrecurring to a chronic thought. ‘Yes, this morning. Martin hev been\ntolling ever since, almost. There, ‘twas expected. She was very limber.’\n\n‘Ay, poor soul, this morning,’ resumed the under-mason, a marvellously\nold man, whose skin seemed so much too large for his body that it would\nnot stay in position. ‘She must know by this time whether she’s to go up\nor down, poor woman.’\n\n‘What was her age?’\n\n‘Not more than seven or eight and twenty by candlelight. But, Lord! by\nday ‘a was forty if ‘a were an hour.’\n\n‘Ay, night-time or day-time makes a difference of twenty years to rich\nfeymels,’ observed Martin.\n\n‘She was one and thirty really,’ said John Smith. ‘I had it from them\nthat know.’\n\n‘Not more than that!’\n\n‘’A looked very bad, poor lady. In faith, ye might say she was dead for\nyears afore ‘a would own it.’\n\n‘As my old father used to say, “dead, but wouldn’t drop down.”’\n\n‘I seed her, poor soul,’ said a labourer from behind some removed\ncoffins, ‘only but last Valentine’s-day of all the world. ‘A was arm\nin crook wi’ my lord. I says to myself, “You be ticketed Churchyard, my\nnoble lady, although you don’t dream on’t.”’\n\n‘I suppose my lord will write to all the other lords anointed in the\nnation, to let ‘em know that she that was is now no more?’\n\n‘’Tis done and past. I see a bundle of letters go off an hour after the\ndeath. Sich wonderful black rims as they letters had--half-an-inch wide,\nat the very least.’\n\n‘Too much,’ observed Martin. ‘In short, ‘tis out of the question that\na human being can be so mournful as black edges half-an-inch wide. I’m\nsure people don’t feel more than a very narrow border when they feels\nmost of all.’\n\n‘And there are two little girls, are there not?’ said Stephen.\n\n‘Nice clane little faces!--left motherless now.’\n\n‘They used to come to Parson Swancourt’s to play with Miss Elfride\nwhen I were there,’ said William Worm. ‘Ah, they did so’s!’ The latter\nsentence was introduced to add the necessary melancholy to a remark\nwhich, intrinsically, could hardly be made to possess enough for the\noccasion. ‘Yes,’ continued Worm, ‘they’d run upstairs, they’d run down;\nflitting about with her everywhere. Very fond of her, they were. Ah,\nwell!’\n\n‘Fonder than ever they were of their mother, so ‘tis said here and\nthere,’ added a labourer.\n\n‘Well, you see, ‘tis natural. Lady Luxellian stood aloof from\n‘em so--was so drowsy-like, that they couldn’t love her in the\njolly-companion way children want to like folks. Only last winter I seed\nMiss Elfride talking to my lady and the two children, and Miss Elfride\nwiped their noses for em’ SO careful--my lady never once seeing that it\nwanted doing; and, naturally, children take to people that’s their best\nfriend.’\n\n‘Be as ‘twill, the woman is dead and gone, and we must make a place for\nher,’ said John. ‘Come, lads, drink up your ale, and we’ll just rid this\ncorner, so as to have all clear for beginning at the wall, as soon as\n‘tis light to-morrow.’\n\nStephen then asked where Lady Luxellian was to lie.\n\n‘Here,’ said his father. ‘We are going to set back this wall and make a\nrecess; and ‘tis enough for us to do before the funeral. When my lord’s\nmother died, she said, “John, the place must be enlarged before another\ncan be put in.” But ‘a never expected ‘twould be wanted so soon. Better\nmove Lord George first, I suppose, Simeon?’\n\nHe pointed with his foot to a heavy coffin, covered with what had\noriginally been red velvet, the colour of which could only just be\ndistinguished now.\n\n‘Just as ye think best, Master John,’ replied the shrivelled mason. ‘Ah,\npoor Lord George!’ he continued, looking contemplatively at the huge\ncoffin; ‘he and I were as bitter enemies once as any could be when one\nis a lord and t’other only a mortal man. Poor fellow! He’d clap his hand\nupon my shoulder and cuss me as familial and neighbourly as if he’d been\na common chap. Ay, ‘a cussed me up hill and ‘a cussed me down; and then\n‘a would rave out again, and the goold clamps of his fine new teeth\nwould glisten in the sun like fetters of brass, while I, being a small\nman and poor, was fain to say nothing at all. Such a strappen fine\ngentleman as he was too! Yes, I rather liked en sometimes. But once now\nand then, when I looked at his towering height, I’d think in my inside,\n“What a weight you’ll be, my lord, for our arms to lower under the aisle\nof Endelstow Church some day!”’\n\n‘And was he?’ inquired a young labourer.\n\n‘He was. He was five hundredweight if ‘a were a pound. What with his\nlead, and his oak, and his handles, and his one thing and t’other’--here\nthe ancient man slapped his hand upon the cover with a force that caused\na rattle among the bones inside--‘he half broke my back when I took\nhis feet to lower en down the steps there. “Ah,” saith I to John\nthere--didn’t I, John?--“that ever one man’s glory should be such a\nweight upon another man!” But there, I liked my lord George sometimes.’\n\n‘’Tis a strange thought,’ said another, ‘that while they be all here\nunder one roof, a snug united family o’ Luxellians, they be really\nscattered miles away from one another in the form of good sheep and\nwicked goats, isn’t it?’\n\n‘True; ‘tis a thought to look at.’\n\n‘And that one, if he’s gone upward, don’t know what his wife is doing\nno more than the man in the moon if she’s gone downward. And that some\nunfortunate one in the hot place is a-hollering across to a lucky one up\nin the clouds, and quite forgetting their bodies be boxed close together\nall the time.’\n\n‘Ay, ‘tis a thought to look at, too, that I can say “Hullo!” close to\nfiery Lord George, and ‘a can’t hear me.’\n\n‘And that I be eating my onion close to dainty Lady Jane’s nose, and she\ncan’t smell me.’\n\n‘What do ‘em put all their heads one way for?’ inquired a young man.\n\n‘Because ‘tis churchyard law, you simple. The law of the living is, that\na man shall be upright and down-right, and the law of the dead is, that\na man shall be east and west. Every state of society have its laws.’\n\n‘We must break the law wi’ a few of the poor souls, however. Come,\nbuckle to,’ said the master-mason.\n\nAnd they set to work anew.\n\nThe order of interment could be distinctly traced by observing the\nappearance of the coffins as they lay piled around. On those which\nhad been standing there but a generation or two the trappings still\nremained. Those of an earlier period showed bare wood, with a few\ntattered rags dangling therefrom. Earlier still, the wood lay in\nfragments on the floor of the niche, and the coffin consisted of naked\nlead alone; whilst in the case of the very oldest, even the lead was\nbulging and cracking in pieces, revealing to the curious eye a heap of\ndust within. The shields upon many were quite loose, and removable by\nthe hand, their lustreless surfaces still indistinctly exhibiting the\nname and title of the deceased.\n\nOverhead the groins and concavities of the arches curved in all\ndirections, dropping low towards the walls, where the height was no more\nthan sufficient to enable a person to stand upright.\n\nThe body of George the fourteenth baron, together with two or three\nothers, all of more recent date than the great bulk of coffins piled\nthere, had, for want of room, been placed at the end of the vault on\ntressels, and not in niches like the others. These it was necessary to\nremove, to form behind them the chamber in which they were ultimately to\nbe deposited. Stephen, finding the place and proceedings in keeping with\nthe sombre colours of his mind, waited there still.\n\n‘Simeon, I suppose you can mind poor Lady Elfride, and how she ran away\nwith the actor?’ said John Smith, after awhile. ‘I think it fell upon\nthe time my father was sexton here. Let us see--where is she?’\n\n‘Here somewhere,’ returned Simeon, looking round him.\n\n‘Why, I’ve got my arms round the very gentlewoman at this moment.’\nHe lowered the end of the coffin he was holding, wiped his face,\nand throwing a morsel of rotten wood upon another as an indicator,\ncontinued: ‘That’s her husband there. They was as fair a couple as you\nshould see anywhere round about; and a good-hearted pair likewise. Ay, I\ncan mind it, though I was but a chiel at the time. She fell in love with\nthis young man of hers, and their banns were asked in some church in\nLondon; and the old lord her father actually heard ‘em asked the three\ntimes, and didn’t notice her name, being gabbled on wi’ a host of\nothers. When she had married she told her father, and ‘a fleed into a\nmonstrous rage, and said she shouldn’ hae a farthing. Lady Elfride said\nshe didn’t think of wishing it; if he’d forgie her ‘twas all she asked,\nand as for a living, she was content to play plays with her husband.\nThis frightened the old lord, and ‘a gie’d ‘em a house to live in, and a\ngreat garden, and a little field or two, and a carriage, and a good\nfew guineas. Well, the poor thing died at her first gossiping, and her\nhusband--who was as tender-hearted a man as ever eat meat, and would\nhave died for her--went wild in his mind, and broke his heart (so ‘twas\nsaid). Anyhow, they were buried the same day--father and mother--but the\nbaby lived. Ay, my lord’s family made much of that man then, and put him\nhere with his wife, and there in the corner the man is now. The Sunday\nafter there was a funeral sermon: the text was, “Or ever the silver cord\nbe loosed, or the golden bowl be broken;” and when ‘twas preaching the\nmen drew their hands across their eyes several times, and every woman\ncried out loud.’\n\n‘And what became of the baby?’ said Stephen, who had frequently heard\nportions of the story.\n\n‘She was brought up by her grandmother, and a pretty maid she were. And\nshe must needs run away with the curate--Parson Swancourt that is now.\nThen her grandmother died, and the title and everything went away to\nanother branch of the family altogether. Parson Swancourt wasted a good\ndeal of his wife’s money, and she left him Miss Elfride. That trick\nof running away seems to be handed down in families, like craziness or\ngout. And they two women be alike as peas.’\n\n‘Which two?’\n\n‘Lady Elfride and young Miss that’s alive now. The same hair and eyes:\nbut Miss Elfride’s mother was darker a good deal.’\n\n‘Life’s a strangle bubble, ye see,’ said William Worm musingly. ‘For\nif the Lord’s anointment had descended upon women instead of men, Miss\nElfride would be Lord Luxellian--Lady, I mane. But as it is, the blood\nis run out, and she’s nothing to the Luxellian family by law, whatever\nshe may be by gospel.’\n\n‘I used to fancy,’ said Simeon, ‘when I seed Miss Elfride hugging the\nlittle ladyships, that there was a likeness; but I suppose ‘twas only my\ndream, for years must have altered the old family shape.’\n\n‘And now we’ll move these two, and home-along,’ interposed John Smith,\nreviving, as became a master, the spirit of labour, which had showed\nunmistakable signs of being nearly vanquished by the spirit of chat,\n‘The flagon of ale we don’t want we’ll let bide here till to-morrow;\nnone of the poor souls will touch it ‘a b’lieve.’\n\nSo the evening’s work was concluded, and the party drew from the abode\nof the quiet dead, closing the old iron door, and shooting the lock\nloudly into the huge copper staple--an incongruous act of imprisonment\ntowards those who had no dreams of escape.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXVII\n\n     ‘How should I greet thee?’\n\n\nLove frequently dies of time alone--much more frequently of\ndisplacement. With Elfride Swancourt, a powerful reason why the\ndisplacement should be successful was that the new-comer was a greater\nman than the first. By the side of the instructive and piquant snubbings\nshe received from Knight, Stephen’s general agreeableness seemed watery;\nby the side of Knight’s spare love-making, Stephen’s continual outflow\nseemed lackadaisical. She had begun to sigh for somebody further on in\nmanhood. Stephen was hardly enough of a man.\n\nPerhaps there was a proneness to inconstancy in her nature--a nature, to\nthose who contemplate it from a standpoint beyond the influence of\nthat inconstancy, the most exquisite of all in its plasticity and ready\nsympathies. Partly, too, Stephen’s failure to make his hold on her heart\na permanent one was his too timid habit of dispraising himself beside\nher--a peculiarity which, exercised towards sensible men, stirs a kindly\nchord of attachment that a marked assertiveness would leave untouched,\nbut inevitably leads the most sensible woman in the world to undervalue\nhim who practises it. Directly domineering ceases in the man, snubbing\nbegins in the woman; the trite but no less unfortunate fact being\nthat the gentler creature rarely has the capacity to appreciate fair\ntreatment from her natural complement. The abiding perception of the\nposition of Stephen’s parents had, of course, a little to do with\nElfride’s renunciation. To such girls poverty may not be, as to the more\nworldly masses of humanity, a sin in itself; but it is a sin, because\ngraceful and dainty manners seldom exist in such an atmosphere. Few\nwomen of old family can be thoroughly taught that a fine soul may wear a\nsmock-frock, and an admittedly common man in one is but a worm in their\neyes. John Smith’s rough hands and clothes, his wife’s dialect, the\nnecessary narrowness of their ways, being constantly under Elfride’s\nnotice, were not without their deflecting influence.\n\nOn reaching home after the perilous adventure by the sea-shore, Knight\nhad felt unwell, and retired almost immediately. The young lady who\nhad so materially assisted him had done the same, but she reappeared,\nproperly clothed, about five o’clock. She wandered restlessly about the\nhouse, but not on account of their joint narrow escape from death. The\nstorm which had torn the tree had merely bowed the reed, and with the\ndeliverance of Knight all deep thought of the accident had left her. The\nmutual avowal which it had been the means of precipitating occupied a\nfar longer length of her meditations.\n\nElfride’s disquiet now was on account of that miserable promise to meet\nStephen, which returned like a spectre again and again. The perception\nof his littleness beside Knight grew upon her alarmingly. She now\nthought how sound had been her father’s advice to her to give him up,\nand was as passionately desirous of following it as she had hitherto\nbeen averse. Perhaps there is nothing more hardening to the tone of\nyoung minds than thus to discover how their dearest and strongest wishes\nbecome gradually attuned by Time the Cynic to the very note of some\nselfish policy which in earlier days they despised.\n\nThe hour of appointment came, and with it a crisis; and with the crisis\na collapse.\n\n‘God forgive me--I can’t meet Stephen!’ she exclaimed to herself. ‘I\ndon’t love him less, but I love Mr. Knight more!’\n\nYes: she would save herself from a man not fit for her--in spite of\nvows. She would obey her father, and have no more to do with Stephen\nSmith. Thus the fickle resolve showed signs of assuming the complexion\nof a virtue.\n\nThe following days were passed without any definite avowal from Knight’s\nlips. Such solitary walks and scenes as that witnessed by Smith in the\nsummer-house were frequent, but he courted her so intangibly that to any\nbut such a delicate perception as Elfride’s it would have appeared no\ncourtship at all. The time now really began to be sweet with her. She\ndismissed the sense of sin in her past actions, and was automatic in\nthe intoxication of the moment. The fact that Knight made no actual\ndeclaration was no drawback. Knowing since the betrayal of his\nsentiments that love for her really existed, she preferred it for the\npresent in its form of essence, and was willing to avoid for awhile the\ngrosser medium of words. Their feelings having been forced to a rather\npremature demonstration, a reaction was indulged in by both.\n\nBut no sooner had she got rid of her troubled conscience on the matter\nof faithlessness than a new anxiety confronted her. It was lest Knight\nshould accidentally meet Stephen in the parish, and that herself should\nbe the subject of discourse.\n\nElfride, learning Knight more thoroughly, perceived that, far from\nhaving a notion of Stephen’s precedence, he had no idea that she had\never been wooed before by anybody. On ordinary occasions she had a\ntongue so frank as to show her whole mind, and a mind so straightforward\nas to reveal her heart to its innermost shrine. But the time for a\nchange had come. She never alluded to even a knowledge of Knight’s\nfriend. When women are secret they are secret indeed; and more often\nthan not they only begin to be secret with the advent of a second lover.\n\nThe elopement was now a spectre worse than the first, and, like the\nSpirit in Glenfinlas, it waxed taller with every attempt to lay it.\nHer natural honesty invited her to confide in Knight, and trust to his\ngenerosity for forgiveness: she knew also that as mere policy it would\nbe better to tell him early if he was to be told at all. The longer her\nconcealment the more difficult would be the revelation. But she put it\noff. The intense fear which accompanies intense love in young women\nwas too strong to allow the exercise of a moral quality antagonistic to\nitself:\n\n\n   ‘Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;\n    Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.’\n\n\nThe match was looked upon as made by her father and mother. The vicar\nremembered her promise to reveal the meaning of the telegram she had\nreceived, and two days after the scene in the summer-house, asked her\npointedly. She was frank with him now.\n\n‘I had been corresponding with Stephen Smith ever since he left England,\ntill lately,’ she calmly said.\n\n‘What!’ cried the vicar aghast; ‘under the eyes of Mr. Knight, too?’\n\n‘No; when I found I cared most for Mr. Knight, I obeyed you.’\n\n‘You were very kind, I’m sure. When did you begin to like Mr. Knight?’\n\n‘I don’t see that that is a pertinent question, papa; the telegram was\nfrom the shipping agent, and was not sent at my request. It announced\nthe arrival of the vessel bringing him home.’\n\n‘Home! What, is he here?’\n\n‘Yes; in the village, I believe.’\n\n‘Has he tried to see you?’\n\n‘Only by fair means. But don’t, papa, question me so! It is torture.’\n\n‘I will only say one word more,’ he replied. ‘Have you met him?’\n\n‘I have not. I can assure you that at the present moment there is\nno more of an understanding between me and the young man you so much\ndisliked than between him and you. You told me to forget him; and I have\nforgotten him.’\n\n‘Oh, well; though you did not obey me in the beginning, you are a good\ngirl, Elfride, in obeying me at last.’\n\n‘Don’t call me “good,” papa,’ she said bitterly; ‘you don’t know--and\nthe less said about some things the better. Remember, Mr. Knight knows\nnothing about the other. Oh, how wrong it all is! I don’t know what I am\ncoming to.’\n\n‘As matters stand, I should be inclined to tell him; or, at any rate,\nI should not alarm myself about his knowing. He found out the other day\nthat this was the parish young Smith’s father lives in--what puts you in\nsuch a flurry?’\n\n‘I can’t say; but promise--pray don’t let him know! It would be my\nruin!’\n\n‘Pooh, child. Knight is a good fellow and a clever man; but at the same\ntime it does not escape my perceptions that he is no great catch for\nyou. Men of his turn of mind are nothing so wonderful in the way of\nhusbands. If you had chosen to wait, you might have mated with a much\nwealthier man. But remember, I have not a word to say against your\nhaving him, if you like him. Charlotte is delighted, as you know.’\n\n‘Well, papa,’ she said, smiling hopefully through a sigh, ‘it is nice to\nfeel that in giving way to--to caring for him, I have pleased my family.\nBut I am not good; oh no, I am very far from that!’\n\n‘None of us are good, I am sorry to say,’ said her father blandly; ‘but\ngirls have a chartered right to change their minds, you know. It has\nbeen recognized by poets from time immemorial. Catullus says, “Mulier\ncupido quod dicit amanti, in vento--” What a memory mine is! However,\nthe passage is, that a woman’s words to a lover are as a matter of\ncourse written only on wind and water. Now don’t be troubled about that,\nElfride.’\n\n‘Ah, you don’t know!’\n\nThey had been standing on the lawn, and Knight was now seen lingering\nsome way down a winding walk. When Elfride met him, it was with a much\ngreater lightness of heart; things were more straightforward now. The\nresponsibility of her fickleness seemed partly shifted from her own\nshoulders to her father’s. Still, there were shadows.\n\n‘Ah, could he have known how far I went with Stephen, and yet have\nsaid the same, how much happier I should be!’ That was her prevailing\nthought.\n\nIn the afternoon the lovers went out together on horseback for an hour\nor two; and though not wishing to be observed, by reason of the late\ndeath of Lady Luxellian, whose funeral had taken place very privately\non the previous day, they yet found it necessary to pass East Endelstow\nChurch.\n\nThe steps to the vault, as has been stated, were on the outside of the\nbuilding, immediately under the aisle wall. Being on horseback,\nboth Knight and Elfride could overlook the shrubs which screened the\nchurch-yard.\n\n‘Look, the vault seems still to be open,’ said Knight.\n\n‘Yes, it is open,’ she answered\n\n‘Who is that man close by it? The mason, I suppose?’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘I wonder if it is John Smith, Stephen’s father?’\n\n‘I believe it is,’ said Elfride, with apprehension.\n\n‘Ah, and can it be? I should like to inquire how his son, my truant\nprotege’, is going on. And from your father’s description of the vault,\nthe interior must be interesting. Suppose we go in.’\n\n‘Had we better, do you think? May not Lord Luxellian be there?’\n\n‘It is not at all likely.’\n\nElfride then assented, since she could do nothing else. Her heart,\nwhich at first had quailed in consternation, recovered itself when she\nconsidered the character of John Smith. A quiet unassuming man, he would\nbe sure to act towards her as before those love passages with his son,\nwhich might have given a more pretentious mechanic airs. So without much\nalarm she took Knight’s arm after dismounting, and went with him between\nand over the graves. The master-mason recognized her as she approached,\nand, as usual, lifted his hat respectfully.\n\n‘I know you to be Mr. Smith, my former friend Stephen’s father,’ said\nKnight, directly he had scanned the embrowned and ruddy features of\nJohn.\n\n‘Yes, sir, I b’lieve I be.’\n\n‘How is your son now? I have only once heard from him since he went to\nIndia. I daresay you have heard him speak of me--Mr. Knight, who became\nacquainted with him some years ago in Exonbury.’\n\n‘Ay, that I have. Stephen is very well, thank you, sir, and he’s in\nEngland; in fact, he’s at home. In short, sir, he’s down in the vault\nthere, a-looking at the departed coffins.’\n\nElfride’s heart fluttered like a butterfly.\n\nKnight looked amazed. ‘Well, that is extraordinary.’ he murmured. ‘Did\nhe know I was in the parish?’\n\n‘I really can’t say, sir,’ said John, wishing himself out of the\nentanglement he rather suspected than thoroughly understood.\n\n‘Would it be considered an intrusion by the family if we went into the\nvault?’\n\n‘Oh, bless ye, no, sir; scores of folk have been stepping down. ‘Tis\nleft open a-purpose.’\n\n‘We will go down, Elfride.’\n\n‘I am afraid the air is close,’ she said appealingly.\n\n‘Oh no, ma’am,’ said John. ‘We white-limed the walls and arches the day\n‘twas opened, as we always do, and again on the morning of the funeral;\nthe place is as sweet as a granary.\n\n‘Then I should like you to accompany me, Elfie; having originally sprung\nfrom the family too.’\n\n‘I don’t like going where death is so emphatically present. I’ll stay by\nthe horses whilst you go in; they may get loose.’\n\n‘What nonsense! I had no idea your sentiments were so flimsily formed as\nto be perturbed by a few remnants of mortality; but stay out, if you are\nso afraid, by all means.’\n\n‘Oh no, I am not afraid; don’t say that.’\n\nShe held miserably to his arm, thinking that, perhaps, the revelation\nmight as well come at once as ten minutes later, for Stephen would be\nsure to accompany his friend to his horse.\n\nAt first, the gloom of the vault, which was lighted only by a couple of\ncandles, was too great to admit of their seeing anything distinctly; but\nwith a further advance Knight discerned, in front of the black masses\nlining the walls, a young man standing, and writing in a pocket-book.\n\nKnight said one word: ‘Stephen!’\n\nStephen Smith, not being in such absolute ignorance of Knight’s\nwhereabouts as Knight had been of Smith’s instantly recognized his\nfriend, and knew by rote the outlines of the fair woman standing behind\nhim.\n\nStephen came forward and shook him by the hand, without speaking.\n\n‘Why have you not written, my boy?’ said Knight, without in any way\nsignifying Elfride’s presence to Stephen. To the essayist, Smith was\nstill the country lad whom he had patronized and tended; one to whom\nthe formal presentation of a lady betrothed to himself would have seemed\nincongruous and absurd.\n\n‘Why haven’t you written to me?’ said Stephen.\n\n‘Ah, yes. Why haven’t I? why haven’t we? That’s always the query\nwhich we cannot clearly answer without an unsatisfactory sense of our\ninadequacies. However, I have not forgotten you, Smith. And now we\nhave met; and we must meet again, and have a longer chat than this can\nconveniently be. I must know all you have been doing. That you have\nthriven, I know, and you must teach me the way.’\n\nElfride stood in the background. Stephen had read the position at a\nglance, and immediately guessed that she had never mentioned his name\nto Knight. His tact in avoiding catastrophes was the chief quality which\nmade him intellectually respectable, in which quality he far transcended\nKnight; and he decided that a tranquil issue out of the encounter,\nwithout any harrowing of the feelings of either Knight or Elfride, was\nto be attempted if possible. His old sense of indebtedness to Knight had\nnever wholly forsaken him; his love for Elfride was generous now.\n\nAs far as he dared look at her movements he saw that her bearing towards\nhim would be dictated by his own towards her; and if he acted as a\nstranger she would do likewise as a means of deliverance. Circumstances\nfavouring this course, it was desirable also to be rather reserved\ntowards Knight, to shorten the meeting as much as possible.\n\n‘I am afraid that my time is almost too short to allow even of such a\npleasure,’ he said. ‘I leave here to-morrow. And until I start for the\nContinent and India, which will be in a fortnight, I shall have hardly a\nmoment to spare.’\n\nKnight’s disappointment and dissatisfied looks at this reply sent a pang\nthrough Stephen as great as any he had felt at the sight of Elfride. The\nwords about shortness of time were literally true, but their tone was\nfar from being so. He would have been gratified to talk with Knight as\nin past times, and saw as a dead loss to himself that, to save the woman\nwho cared nothing for him, he was deliberately throwing away his friend.\n\n‘Oh, I am sorry to hear that,’ said Knight, in a changed tone. ‘But\nof course, if you have weighty concerns to attend to, they must not be\nneglected. And if this is to be our first and last meeting, let me say\nthat I wish you success with all my heart!’ Knight’s warmth revived\ntowards the end; the solemn impressions he was beginning to receive\nfrom the scene around them abstracting from his heart as a puerility any\nmomentary vexation at words. ‘It is a strange place for us to meet in,’\nhe continued, looking round the vault.\n\nStephen briefly assented, and there was a silence. The blackened coffins\nwere now revealed more clearly than at first, the whitened walls and\narches throwing them forward in strong relief. It was a scene which was\nremembered by all three as an indelible mark in their history. Knight,\nwith an abstracted face, was standing between his companions, though a\nlittle in advance of them, Elfride being on his right hand, and Stephen\nSmith on his left. The white daylight on his right side gleamed faintly\nin, and was toned to a blueness by contrast with the yellow rays from\nthe candle against the wall. Elfride, timidly shrinking back, and\nnearest the entrance, received most of the light therefrom, whilst\nStephen was entirely in candlelight, and to him the spot of outer sky\nvisible above the steps was as a steely blue patch, and nothing more.\n\n‘I have been here two or three times since it was opened,’ said Stephen.\n‘My father was engaged in the work, you know.’\n\n‘Yes. What are you doing?’ Knight inquired, looking at the note-book and\npencil Stephen held in his hand.\n\n‘I have been sketching a few details in the church, and since then I\nhave been copying the names from some of the coffins here. Before I left\nEngland I used to do a good deal of this sort of thing.’\n\n‘Yes; of course. Ah, that’s poor Lady Luxellian, I suppose.’ Knight\npointed to a coffin of light satin-wood, which stood on the stone\nsleepers in the new niche. ‘And the remainder of the family are on this\nside. Who are those two, so snug and close together?’\n\nStephen’s voice altered slightly as he replied ‘That’s Lady Elfride\nKingsmore--born Luxellian, and that is Arthur, her husband. I have heard\nmy father say that they--he--ran away with her, and married her against\nthe wish of her parents.’\n\n‘Then I imagine this to be where you got your Christian name, Miss\nSwancourt?’ said Knight, turning to her. ‘I think you told me it was\nthree or four generations ago that your family branched off from the\nLuxellians?’\n\n‘She was my grandmother,’ said Elfride, vainly endeavouring to moisten\nher dry lips before she spoke. Elfride had then the conscience-stricken\nlook of Guido’s Magdalen, rendered upon a more childlike form. She kept\nher face partially away from Knight and Stephen, and set her eyes upon\nthe sky visible outside, as if her salvation depended upon quickly\nreaching it. Her left hand rested lightly within Knight’s arm, half\nwithdrawn, from a sense of shame at claiming him before her old lover,\nyet unwilling to renounce him; so that her glove merely touched\nhis sleeve. ‘“Can one be pardoned, and retain the offence?”’ quoted\nElfride’s heart then.\n\nConversation seemed to have no self-sustaining power, and went on in\nthe shape of disjointed remarks. ‘One’s mind gets thronged with thoughts\nwhile standing so solemnly here,’ Knight said, in a measured quiet\nvoice. ‘How much has been said on death from time to time! how much we\nourselves can think upon it! We may fancy each of these who lie here\nsaying:\n\n\n    ‘For Thou, to make my fall more great,\n        Didst lift me up on high.’\n\n\nWhat comes next, Elfride? It is the Hundred-and-second Psalm I am\nthinking of.’\n\n‘Yes, I know it,’ she murmured, and went on in a still lower voice,\nseemingly afraid for any words from the emotional side of her nature to\nreach Stephen:\n\n\n   ‘“My days, just hastening to their end,\n        Are like an evening shade;\n     My beauty doth, like wither’d grass,\n        With waning lustre fade.”’\n\n\n‘Well,’ said Knight musingly, ‘let us leave them. Such occasions as\nthese seem to compel us to roam outside ourselves, far away from the\nfragile frame we live in, and to expand till our perception grows so\nvast that our physical reality bears no sort of proportion to it. We\nlook back upon the weak and minute stem on which this luxuriant\ngrowth depends, and ask, Can it be possible that such a capacity has a\nfoundation so small? Must I again return to my daily walk in that narrow\ncell, a human body, where worldly thoughts can torture me? Do we not?’\n\n‘Yes,’ said Stephen and Elfride.\n\n‘One has a sense of wrong, too, that such an appreciative breadth as a\nsentient being possesses should be committed to the frail casket of\na body. What weakens one’s intentions regarding the future like the\nthought of this?...However, let us tune ourselves to a more cheerful\nchord, for there’s a great deal to be done yet by us all.’\n\nAs Knight meditatively addressed his juniors thus, unconscious of the\ndeception practised, for different reasons, by the severed hearts at his\nside, and of the scenes that had in earlier days united them, each one\nfelt that he and she did not gain by contrast with their musing mentor.\nPhysically not so handsome as either the youthful architect or the\nvicar’s daughter, the thoroughness and integrity of Knight illuminated\nhis features with a dignity not even incipient in the other two. It is\ndifficult to frame rules which shall apply to both sexes, and Elfride,\nan undeveloped girl, must, perhaps, hardly be laden with the moral\nresponsibilities which attach to a man in like circumstances. The charm\nof woman, too, lies partly in her subtleness in matters of love. But if\nhonesty is a virtue in itself, Elfride, having none of it now, seemed,\nbeing for being, scarcely good enough for Knight. Stephen, though\ndeceptive for no unworthy purpose, was deceptive after all; and\nwhatever good results grace such strategy if it succeed, it seldom draws\nadmiration, especially when it fails.\n\nOn an ordinary occasion, had Knight been even quite alone with Stephen,\nhe would hardly have alluded to his possible relationship to Elfride.\nBut moved by attendant circumstances Knight was impelled to be\nconfiding.\n\n‘Stephen,’ he said, ‘this lady is Miss Swancourt. I am staying at her\nfather’s house, as you probably know.’ He stepped a few paces nearer\nto Smith, and said in a lower tone: ‘I may as well tell you that we are\nengaged to be married.’\n\nLow as the words had been spoken, Elfride had heard them, and awaited\nStephen’s reply in breathless silence, if that could be called silence\nwhere Elfride’s dress, at each throb of her heart, shook and indicated\nit like a pulse-glass, rustling also against the wall in reply to the\nsame throbbing. The ray of daylight which reached her face lent it a\nblue pallor in comparison with those of the other two.\n\n‘I congratulate you,’ Stephen whispered; and said aloud, ‘I know Miss\nSwancourt--a little. You must remember that my father is a parishioner\nof Mr. Swancourt’s.’\n\n‘I thought you might possibly not have lived at home since they have\nbeen here.’\n\n‘I have never lived at home, certainly, since that time.’\n\n‘I have seen Mr. Smith,’ faltered Elfride.\n\n‘Well, there is no excuse for me. As strangers to each other I ought,\nI suppose, to have introduced you: as acquaintances, I should not have\nstood so persistently between you. But the fact is, Smith, you seem a\nboy to me, even now.’\n\nStephen appeared to have a more than previous consciousness of the\nintense cruelty of his fate at the present moment. He could not repress\nthe words, uttered with a dim bitterness:\n\n‘You should have said that I seemed still the rural mechanic’s son I am,\nand hence an unfit subject for the ceremony of introductions.’\n\n‘Oh, no, no! I won’t have that.’ Knight endeavoured to give his reply\na laughing tone in Elfride’s ears, and an earnestness in Stephen’s:\nin both which efforts he signally failed, and produced a forced speech\npleasant to neither. ‘Well, let us go into the open air again; Miss\nSwancourt, you are particularly silent. You mustn’t mind Smith. I have\nknown him for years, as I have told you.’\n\n‘Yes, you have,’ she said.\n\n‘To think she has never mentioned her knowledge of me!’ Smith murmured,\nand thought with some remorse how much her conduct resembled his own on\nhis first arrival at her house as a stranger to the place.\n\nThey ascended to the daylight, Knight taking no further notice of\nElfride’s manner, which, as usual, he attributed to the natural shyness\nof a young woman at being discovered walking with him on terms which\nleft not much doubt of their meaning. Elfride stepped a little in\nadvance, and passed through the churchyard.\n\n‘You are changed very considerably, Smith,’ said Knight, ‘and I suppose\nit is no more than was to be expected. However, don’t imagine that I\nshall feel any the less interest in you and your fortunes whenever you\ncare to confide them to me. I have not forgotten the attachment you\nspoke of as your reason for going away to India. A London young lady,\nwas it not? I hope all is prosperous?’\n\n‘No: the match is broken off.’\n\nIt being always difficult to know whether to express sorrow or gladness\nunder such circumstances--all depending upon the character of the\nmatch--Knight took shelter in the safe words: ‘I trust it was for the\nbest.’\n\n‘I hope it was. But I beg that you will not press me further: no, you\nhave not pressed me--I don’t mean that--but I would rather not speak\nupon the subject.’\n\nStephen’s words were hurried.\n\nKnight said no more, and they followed in the footsteps of Elfride, who\nstill kept some paces in advance, and had not heard Knight’s unconscious\nallusion to her. Stephen bade him adieu at the churchyard-gate without\ngoing outside, and watched whilst he and his sweetheart mounted their\nhorses.\n\n‘Good heavens, Elfride,’ Knight exclaimed, ‘how pale you are! I suppose\nI ought not to have taken you into that vault. What is the matter?’\n\n‘Nothing,’ said Elfride faintly. ‘I shall be myself in a moment. All was\nso strange and unexpected down there, that it made me unwell.’\n\n‘I thought you said very little. Shall I get some water?’\n\n‘No, no.’\n\n‘Do you think it is safe for you to mount?’\n\n‘Quite--indeed it is,’ she said, with a look of appeal.\n\n‘Now then--up she goes!’ whispered Knight, and lifted her tenderly into\nthe saddle.\n\nHer old lover still looked on at the performance as he leant over the\ngate a dozen yards off. Once in the saddle, and having a firm grip of\nthe reins, she turned her head as if by a resistless fascination, and\nfor the first time since that memorable parting on the moor outside\nSt. Launce’s after the passionate attempt at marriage with him, Elfride\nlooked in the face of the young man she first had loved. He was the\nyouth who had called her his inseparable wife many a time, and whom she\nhad even addressed as her husband. Their eyes met. Measurement of life\nshould be proportioned rather to the intensity of the experience than\nto its actual length. Their glance, but a moment chronologically, was\na season in their history. To Elfride the intense agony of reproach in\nStephen’s eye was a nail piercing her heart with a deadliness no words\ncan describe. With a spasmodic effort she withdrew her eyes, urged on\nthe horse, and in the chaos of perturbed memories was oblivious of any\npresence beside her. The deed of deception was complete.\n\nGaining a knoll on which the park transformed itself into wood and\ncopse, Knight came still closer to her side, and said, ‘Are you better\nnow, dearest?’\n\n‘Oh yes.’ She pressed a hand to her eyes, as if to blot out the image of\nStephen. A vivid scarlet spot now shone with preternatural brightness in\nthe centre of each cheek, leaving the remainder of her face lily-white\nas before.\n\n‘Elfride,’ said Knight, rather in his old tone of mentor, ‘you know I\ndon’t for a moment chide you, but is there not a great deal of unwomanly\nweakness in your allowing yourself to be so overwhelmed by the sight of\nwhat, after all, is no novelty? Every woman worthy of the name should, I\nthink, be able to look upon death with something like composure. Surely\nyou think so too?’\n\n‘Yes; I own it.’\n\nHis obtuseness to the cause of her indisposition, by evidencing his\nentire freedom from the suspicion of anything behind the scenes, showed\nhow incapable Knight was of deception himself, rather than any inherent\ndulness in him regarding human nature. This, clearly perceived by\nElfride, added poignancy to her self-reproach, and she idolized him the\nmore because of their difference. Even the recent sight of Stephen’s\nface and the sound of his voice, which for a moment had stirred a chord\nor two of ancient kindness, were unable to keep down the adoration\nre-existent now that he was again out of view.\n\nShe had replied to Knight’s question hastily, and immediately went on to\nspeak of indifferent subjects. After they had reached home she was apart\nfrom him till dinner-time. When dinner was over, and they were watching\nthe dusk in the drawing-room, Knight stepped out upon the terrace.\nElfride went after him very decisively, on the spur of a virtuous\nintention.\n\n‘Mr. Knight, I want to tell you something,’ she said, with quiet\nfirmness.\n\n‘And what is it about?’ gaily returned her lover. ‘Happiness, I hope. Do\nnot let anything keep you so sad as you seem to have been to-day.’\n\n‘I cannot mention the matter until I tell you the whole substance of\nit,’ she said. ‘And that I will do to-morrow. I have been reminded of\nit to-day. It is about something I once did, and don’t think I ought to\nhave done.’\n\nThis, it must be said, was rather a mild way of referring to a frantic\npassion and flight, which, much or little in itself, only accident had\nsaved from being a scandal in the public eye.\n\nKnight thought the matter some trifle, and said pleasantly:\n\n‘Then I am not to hear the dreadful confession now?’\n\n‘No, not now. I did not mean to-night,’ Elfride responded, with a slight\ndecline in the firmness of her voice. ‘It is not light as you think\nit--it troubles me a great deal.’ Fearing now the effect of her own\nearnestness, she added forcedly, ‘Though, perhaps, you may think it\nlight after all.’\n\n‘But you have not said when it is to be?’\n\n‘To-morrow morning. Name a time, will you, and bind me to it? I want you\nto fix an hour, because I am weak, and may otherwise try to get out of\nit.’ She added a little artificial laugh, which showed how timorous her\nresolution was still.\n\n‘Well, say after breakfast--at eleven o’clock.’\n\n‘Yes, eleven o’clock. I promise you. Bind me strictly to my word.’\n\n\n\nChapter XXVIII\n\n‘I lull a fancy, trouble-tost.’\n\n\nMiss Swancourt, it is eleven o’clock.’\n\nShe was looking out of her dressing-room window on the first floor, and\nKnight was regarding her from the terrace balustrade, upon which he had\nbeen idly sitting for some time--dividing the glances of his eye between\nthe pages of a book in his hand, the brilliant hues of the geraniums and\ncalceolarias, and the open window above-mentioned.\n\n‘Yes, it is, I know. I am coming.’\n\nHe drew closer, and under the window.\n\n‘How are you this morning, Elfride? You look no better for your long\nnight’s rest.’\n\nShe appeared at the door shortly after, took his offered arm, and\ntogether they walked slowly down the gravel path leading to the river\nand away under the trees.\n\nHer resolution, sustained during the last fifteen hours, had been to\ntell the whole truth, and now the moment had come.\n\nStep by step they advanced, and still she did not speak. They were\nnearly at the end of the walk, when Knight broke the silence.\n\n‘Well, what is the confession, Elfride?’\n\nShe paused a moment, drew a long breath; and this is what she said:\n\n‘I told you one day--or rather I gave you to understand--what was not\ntrue. I fancy you thought me to mean I was nineteen my next birthday,\nbut it was my last I was nineteen.’\n\nThe moment had been too much for her. Now that the crisis had come,\nno qualms of conscience, no love of honesty, no yearning to make a\nconfidence and obtain forgiveness with a kiss, could string Elfride up\nto the venture. Her dread lest he should be unforgiving was heightened\nby the thought of yesterday’s artifice, which might possibly add disgust\nto his disappointment. The certainty of one more day’s affection, which\nshe gained by silence, outvalued the hope of a perpetuity combined with\nthe risk of all.\n\nThe trepidation caused by these thoughts on what she had intended to say\nshook so naturally the words she did say, that Knight never for a moment\nsuspected them to be a last moment’s substitution. He smiled and pressed\nher hand warmly.\n\n‘My dear Elfie--yes, you are now--no protestation--what a winning little\nwoman you are, to be so absurdly scrupulous about a mere iota! Really, I\nnever once have thought whether your nineteenth year was the last or\nthe present. And, by George, well I may not; for it would never do for a\nstaid fogey a dozen years older to stand upon such a trifle as that.’\n\n‘Don’t praise me--don’t praise me! Though I prize it from your lips, I\ndon’t deserve it now.’\n\nBut Knight, being in an exceptionally genial mood, merely saw this\ndistressful exclamation as modesty. ‘Well,’ he added, after a minute, ‘I\nlike you all the better, you know, for such moral precision, although\nI called it absurd.’ He went on with tender earnestness: ‘For, Elfride,\nthere is one thing I do love to see in a woman--that is, a soul truthful\nand clear as heaven’s light. I could put up with anything if I had\nthat--forgive nothing if I had it not. Elfride, you have such a soul, if\never woman had; and having it, retain it, and don’t ever listen to the\nfashionable theories of the day about a woman’s privileges and natural\nright to practise wiles. Depend upon it, my dear girl, that a noble\nwoman must be as honest as a noble man. I specially mean by honesty,\nfairness not only in matters of business and social detail, but in all\nthe delicate dealings of love, to which the licence given to your sex\nparticularly refers.’\n\nElfride looked troublously at the trees.\n\n‘Now let us go on to the river, Elfie.’\n\n‘I would if I had a hat on,’ she said with a sort of suppressed woe.\n\n‘I will get it for you,’ said Knight, very willing to purchase her\ncompanionship at so cheap a price. ‘You sit down there a minute.’ And he\nturned and walked rapidly back to the house for the article in question.\n\nElfride sat down upon one of the rustic benches which adorned this\nportion of the grounds, and remained with her eyes upon the grass. She\nwas induced to lift them by hearing the brush of light and irregular\nfootsteps hard by. Passing along the path which intersected the one she\nwas in and traversed the outer shrubberies, Elfride beheld the farmer’s\nwidow, Mrs. Jethway. Before she noticed Elfride, she paused to look at\nthe house, portions of which were visible through the bushes. Elfride,\nshrinking back, hoped the unpleasant woman might go on without seeing\nher. But Mrs. Jethway, silently apostrophizing the house, with actions\nwhich seemed dictated by a half-overturned reason, had discerned the\ngirl, and immediately came up and stood in front of her.\n\n‘Ah, Miss Swancourt! Why did you disturb me? Mustn’t I trespass here?’\n\n‘You may walk here if you like, Mrs. Jethway. I do not disturb you.’\n\n‘You disturb my mind, and my mind is my whole life; for my boy is there\nstill, and he is gone from my body.’\n\n‘Yes, poor young man. I was sorry when he died.’\n\n‘Do you know what he died of?’\n\n‘Consumption.’\n\n‘Oh no, no!’ said the widow. ‘That word “consumption” covers a good\ndeal. He died because you were his own well-agreed sweetheart, and then\nproved false--and it killed him. Yes, Miss Swancourt,’ she said in an\nexcited whisper, ‘you killed my son!’\n\n‘How can you be so wicked and foolish!’ replied Elfride, rising\nindignantly. But indignation was not natural to her, and having been so\nworn and harrowed by late events, she lost any powers of defence\nthat mood might have lent her. ‘I could not help his loving me, Mrs.\nJethway!’\n\n‘That’s just what you could have helped. You know how it began, Miss\nElfride. Yes: you said you liked the name of Felix better than any other\nname in the parish, and you knew it was his name, and that those you\nsaid it to would report it to him.’\n\n‘I knew it was his name--of course I did; but I am sure, Mrs. Jethway, I\ndid not intend anybody to tell him.’\n\n‘But you knew they would.’\n\n‘No, I didn’t.’\n\n‘And then, after that, when you were riding on Revels-day by our house,\nand the lads were gathered there, and you wanted to dismount, when Jim\nDrake and George Upway and three or four more ran forward to hold your\npony, and Felix stood back timid, why did you beckon to him, and say you\nwould rather he held it?’\n\n‘O Mrs. Jethway, you do think so mistakenly! I liked him best--that’s\nwhy I wanted him to do it. He was gentle and nice--I always thought him\nso--and I liked him.’\n\n‘Then why did you let him kiss you?’\n\n‘It is a falsehood; oh, it is, it is!’ said Elfride, weeping with\ndesperation. ‘He came behind me, and attempted to kiss me; and that was\nwhy I told him never to let me see him again.’\n\n‘But you did not tell your father or anybody, as you would have if you\nhad looked upon it then as the insult you now pretend it was.’\n\n‘He begged me not to tell, and foolishly enough I did not. And I wish\nI had now. I little expected to be scourged with my own kindness. Pray\nleave me, Mrs. Jethway.’ The girl only expostulated now.\n\n‘Well, you harshly dismissed him, and he died. And before his body was\ncold, you took another to your heart. Then as carelessly sent him about\nhis business, and took a third. And if you consider that nothing, Miss\nSwancourt,’ she continued, drawing closer; ‘it led on to what was very\nserious indeed. Have you forgotten the would-be runaway marriage? The\njourney to London, and the return the next day without being married,\nand that there’s enough disgrace in that to ruin a woman’s good name far\nless light than yours? You may have: I have not. Fickleness towards a\nlover is bad, but fickleness after playing the wife is wantonness.’\n\n‘Oh, it’s a wicked cruel lie! Do not say it; oh, do not!’\n\n‘Does your new man know of it? I think not, or he would be no man\nof yours! As much of the story as was known is creeping about the\nneighbourhood even now; but I know more than any of them, and why should\nI respect your love?’\n\n‘I defy you!’ cried Elfride tempestuously. ‘Do and say all you can to\nruin me; try; put your tongue at work; I invite it! I defy you as a\nslanderous woman! Look, there he comes.’ And her voice trembled greatly\nas she saw through the leaves the beloved form of Knight coming from the\ndoor with her hat in his hand. ‘Tell him at once; I can bear it.’\n\n‘Not now,’ said the woman, and disappeared down the path.\n\nThe excitement of her latter words had restored colour to Elfride’s\ncheeks; and hastily wiping her eyes, she walked farther on, so that by\nthe time her lover had overtaken her the traces of emotion had nearly\ndisappeared from her face. Knight put the hat upon her head, took her\nhand, and drew it within his arm.\n\nIt was the last day but one previous to their departure for St.\nLeonards; and Knight seemed to have a purpose in being much in her\ncompany that day. They rambled along the valley. The season was that\nperiod in the autumn when the foliage alone of an ordinary plantation is\nrich enough in hues to exhaust the chromatic combinations of an artist’s\npalette. Most lustrous of all are the beeches, graduating from bright\nrusty red at the extremity of the boughs to a bright yellow at their\ninner parts; young oaks are still of a neutral green; Scotch firs and\nhollies are nearly blue; whilst occasional dottings of other varieties\ngive maroons and purples of every tinge.\n\nThe river--such as it was--here pursued its course amid flagstones as\nlevel as a pavement, but divided by crevices of irregular width. With\nthe summer drought the torrent had narrowed till it was now but a thread\nof crystal clearness, meandering along a central channel in the rocky\nbed of the winter current. Knight scrambled through the bushes which at\nthis point nearly covered the brook from sight, and leapt down upon the\ndry portion of the river bottom.\n\n‘Elfride, I never saw such a sight!’ he exclaimed. ‘The hazels overhang\nthe river’s course in a perfect arch, and the floor is beautifully\npaved. The place reminds one of the passages of a cloister. Let me help\nyou down.’\n\nHe assisted her through the marginal underwood and down to the stones.\nThey walked on together to a tiny cascade about a foot wide and high,\nand sat down beside it on the flags that for nine months in the year\nwere submerged beneath a gushing bourne. From their feet trickled the\nattenuated thread of water which alone remained to tell the intent and\nreason of this leaf-covered aisle, and journeyed on in a zigzag line\ntill lost in the shade.\n\nKnight, leaning on his elbow, after contemplating all this, looked\ncritically at Elfride.\n\n‘Does not such a luxuriant head of hair exhaust itself and get thin as\nthe years go on from eighteen to eight-and-twenty?’ he asked at length.\n\n‘Oh no!’ she said quickly, with a visible disinclination to harbour such\na thought, which came upon her with an unpleasantness whose force it\nwould be difficult for men to understand. She added afterwards, with\nsmouldering uneasiness, ‘Do you really think that a great abundance of\nhair is more likely to get thin than a moderate quantity?’\n\n‘Yes, I really do. I believe--am almost sure, in fact--that if\nstatistics could be obtained on the subject, you would find the persons\nwith thin hair were those who had a superabundance originally, and that\nthose who start with a moderate quantity retain it without much loss.’\n\nElfride’s troubles sat upon her face as well as in her heart. Perhaps\nto a woman it is almost as dreadful to think of losing her beauty as of\nlosing her reputation. At any rate, she looked quite as gloomy as she\nhad looked at any minute that day.\n\n‘You shouldn’t be so troubled about a mere personal adornment,’ said\nKnight, with some of the severity of tone that had been customary before\nshe had beguiled him into softness.\n\n‘I think it is a woman’s duty to be as beautiful as she can. If I were a\nscholar, I would give you chapter and verse for it from one of your own\nLatin authors. I know there is such a passage, for papa has alluded to\nit.’\n\n“‘Munditiae, et ornatus, et cultus,” &c.--is that it? A passage in Livy\nwhich is no defence at all.’\n\n‘No, it is not that.’\n\n‘Never mind, then; for I have a reason for not taking up my old cudgels\nagainst you, Elfie. Can you guess what the reason is?’\n\n‘No; but I am glad to hear it,’ she said thankfully. ‘For it is dreadful\nwhen you talk so. For whatever dreadful name the weakness may deserve,\nI must candidly own that I am terrified to think my hair may ever get\nthin.’\n\n‘Of course; a sensible woman would rather lose her wits than her\nbeauty.’\n\n‘I don’t care if you do say satire and judge me cruelly. I know my hair\nis beautiful; everybody says so.’\n\n‘Why, my dear Miss Swancourt,’ he tenderly replied, ‘I have not said\nanything against it. But you know what is said about handsome being and\nhandsome doing.’\n\n‘Poor Miss Handsome-does cuts but a sorry figure beside Miss Handsome-is\nin every man’s eyes, your own not excepted, Mr. Knight, though it\npleases you to throw off so,’ said Elfride saucily. And lowering her\nvoice: ‘You ought not to have taken so much trouble to save me from\nfalling over the cliff, for you don’t think mine a life worth much\ntrouble evidently.’\n\n‘Perhaps you think mine was not worth yours.’\n\n‘It was worth anybody’s!’\n\nHer hand was plashing in the little waterfall, and her eyes were bent\nthe same way.\n\n‘You talk about my severity with you, Elfride. You are unkind to me, you\nknow.’\n\n‘How?’ she asked, looking up from her idle occupation.\n\n‘After my taking trouble to get jewellery to please you, you wouldn’t\naccept it.’\n\n‘Perhaps I would now; perhaps I want to.’\n\n‘Do!’ said Knight.\n\nAnd the packet was withdrawn from his pocket and presented the third\ntime. Elfride took it with delight. The obstacle was rent in twain, and\nthe significant gift was hers.\n\n‘I’ll take out these ugly ones at once,’ she exclaimed, ‘and I’ll wear\nyours--shall I?’\n\n‘I should be gratified.’\n\nNow, though it may seem unlikely, considering how far the two had gone\nin converse, Knight had never yet ventured to kiss Elfride. Far slower\nwas he than Stephen Smith in matters like that. The utmost advance he\nhad made in such demonstrations had been to the degree witnessed by\nStephen in the summer-house. So Elfride’s cheek being still forbidden\nfruit to him, he said impulsively.\n\n‘Elfie, I should like to touch that seductive ear of yours. Those are my\ngifts; so let me dress you in them.’\n\nShe hesitated with a stimulating hesitation.\n\n‘Let me put just one in its place, then?’\n\nHer face grew much warmer.\n\n‘I don’t think it would be quite the usual or proper course,’ she said,\nsuddenly turning and resuming her operation of plashing in the miniature\ncataract.\n\nThe stillness of things was disturbed by a bird coming to the streamlet\nto drink. After watching him dip his bill, sprinkle himself, and fly\ninto a tree, Knight replied, with the courteous brusqueness she so much\nliked to hear--\n\n‘Elfride, now you may as well be fair. You would mind my doing it but\nlittle, I think; so give me leave, do.’\n\n‘I will be fair, then,’ she said confidingly, and looking him full in\nthe face. It was a particular pleasure to her to be able to do a little\nhonesty without fear. ‘I should not mind your doing so--I should like\nsuch an attention. My thought was, would it be right to let you?’\n\n‘Then I will!’ he rejoined, with that singular earnestness about a small\nmatter--in the eyes of a ladies’ man but a momentary peg for flirtation\nor jest--which is only found in deep natures who have been wholly unused\nto toying with womankind, and which, from its unwontedness, is in itself\na tribute the most precious that can be rendered, and homage the most\nexquisite to be received.\n\n‘And you shall,’ she whispered, without reserve, and no longer mistress\nof the ceremonies. And then Elfride inclined herself towards him, thrust\nback her hair, and poised her head sideways. In doing this her arm and\nshoulder necessarily rested against his breast.\n\nAt the touch, the sensation of both seemed to be concentrated at the\npoint of contact. All the time he was performing the delicate manoeuvre\nKnight trembled like a young surgeon in his first operation.\n\n‘Now the other,’ said Knight in a whisper.\n\n‘No, no.’\n\n‘Why not?’\n\n‘I don’t know exactly.’\n\n‘You must know.’\n\n‘Your touch agitates me so. Let us go home.’\n\n‘Don’t say that, Elfride. What is it, after all? A mere nothing. Now\nturn round, dearest.’\n\nShe was powerless to disobey, and turned forthwith; and then, without\nany defined intention in either’s mind, his face and hers drew closer\ntogether; and he supported her there, and kissed her.\n\nKnight was at once the most ardent and the coolest man alive. When his\nemotions slumbered he appeared almost phlegmatic; when they were moved\nhe was no less than passionate. And now, without having quite intended\nan early marriage, he put the question plainly. It came with all\nthe ardour which was the accumulation of long years behind a natural\nreserve.\n\n‘Elfride, when shall we be married?’\n\nThe words were sweet to her; but there was a bitter in the sweet. These\nnewly-overt acts of his, which had culminated in this plain question,\ncoming on the very day of Mrs. Jethway’s blasting reproaches, painted\ndistinctly her fickleness as an enormity. Loving him in secret had not\nseemed such thorough-going inconstancy as the same love recognized and\nacted upon in the face of threats. Her distraction was interpreted by\nhim at her side as the outward signs of an unwonted experience.\n\n‘I don’t press you for an answer now, darling,’ he said, seeing she was\nnot likely to give a lucid reply. ‘Take your time.’\n\nKnight was as honourable a man as was ever loved and deluded by\nwoman. It may be said that his blindness in love proved the point,\nfor shrewdness in love usually goes with meanness in general. Once the\npassion had mastered him, the intellect had gone for naught. Knight, as\na lover, was more single-minded and far simpler than his friend Stephen,\nwho in other capacities was shallow beside him.\n\nWithout saying more on the subject of their marriage, Knight held her at\narm’s length, as if she had been a large bouquet, and looked at her with\ncritical affection.\n\n‘Does your pretty gift become me?’ she inquired, with tears of\nexcitement on the fringes of her eyes.\n\n‘Undoubtedly, perfectly!’ said her lover, adopting a lighter tone to put\nher at her ease. ‘Ah, you should see them; you look shinier than ever.\nFancy that I have been able to improve you!’\n\n‘Am I really so nice? I am glad for your sake. I wish I could see\nmyself.’\n\n‘You can’t. You must wait till we get home.’\n\n‘I shall never be able,’ she said, laughing. ‘Look: here’s a way.’\n\n‘So there is. Well done, woman’s wit!’\n\n‘Hold me steady!’\n\n‘Oh yes.’\n\n‘And don’t let me fall, will you?’\n\n‘By no means.’\n\nBelow their seat the thread of water paused to spread out into a smooth\nsmall pool. Knight supported her whilst she knelt down and leant over\nit.\n\n‘I can see myself. Really, try as religiously as I will, I cannot help\nadmiring my appearance in them.’\n\n‘Doubtless. How can you be so fond of finery? I believe you are\ncorrupting me into a taste for it. I used to hate every such thing\nbefore I knew you.’\n\n‘I like ornaments, because I want people to admire what you possess, and\nenvy you, and say, “I wish I was he.”’\n\n‘I suppose I ought not to object after that. And how much longer are you\ngoing to look in there at yourself?’\n\n‘Until you are tired of holding me? Oh, I want to ask you something.’\nAnd she turned round. ‘Now tell truly, won’t you? What colour of hair do\nyou like best now?’\n\nKnight did not answer at the moment.\n\n‘Say light, do!’ she whispered coaxingly. ‘Don’t say dark, as you did\nthat time.’\n\n‘Light-brown, then. Exactly the colour of my sweetheart’s.’\n\n‘Really?’ said Elfride, enjoying as truth what she knew to be flattery.\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘And blue eyes, too, not hazel? Say yes, say yes!’\n\n‘One recantation is enough for to-day.’\n\n‘No, no.’\n\n‘Very well, blue eyes.’ And Knight laughed, and drew her close and\nkissed her the second time, which operations he performed with the\ncarefulness of a fruiterer touching a bunch of grapes so as not to\ndisturb their bloom.\n\nElfride objected to a second, and flung away her face, the movement\ncausing a slight disarrangement of hat and hair. Hardly thinking what\nshe said in the trepidation of the moment, she exclaimed, clapping her\nhand to her ear--\n\n‘Ah, we must be careful! I lost the other earring doing like this.’\n\nNo sooner did she realise the significant words than a troubled look\npassed across her face, and she shut her lips as if to keep them back.\n\n‘Doing like what?’ said Knight, perplexed.\n\n‘Oh, sitting down out of doors,’ she replied hastily.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXIX\n\n     ‘Care, thou canker.’\n\n\nIt is an evening at the beginning of October, and the mellowest of\nautumn sunsets irradiates London, even to its uttermost eastern end.\nBetween the eye and the flaming West, columns of smoke stand up in the\nstill air like tall trees. Everything in the shade is rich and misty\nblue.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Swancourt and Elfride are looking at these lustrous and\nlurid contrasts from the window of a large hotel near London Bridge. The\nvisit to their friends at St. Leonards is over, and they are staying a\nday or two in the metropolis on their way home.\n\nKnight spent the same interval of time in crossing over to Brittany\nby way of Jersey and St. Malo. He then passed through Normandy, and\nreturned to London also, his arrival there having been two days later\nthan that of Elfride and her parents.\n\nSo the evening of this October day saw them all meeting at the\nabove-mentioned hotel, where they had previously engaged apartments.\nDuring the afternoon Knight had been to his lodgings at Richmond to make\na little change in the nature of his baggage; and on coming up again\nthere was never ushered by a bland waiter into a comfortable room a\nhappier man than Knight when shown to where Elfride and her step-mother\nwere sitting after a fatiguing day of shopping.\n\nElfride looked none the better for her change: Knight was as brown as a\nnut. They were soon engaged by themselves in a corner of the room. Now\nthat the precious words of promise had been spoken, the young girl had\nno idea of keeping up her price by the system of reserve which other\nmore accomplished maidens use. Her lover was with her again, and it was\nenough: she made her heart over to him entirely.\n\nDinner was soon despatched. And when a preliminary round of conversation\nconcerning their doings since the last parting had been concluded, they\nreverted to the subject of to-morrow’s journey home.\n\n‘That enervating ride through the myrtle climate of South Devon--how I\ndread it to-morrow!’ Mrs. Swancourt was saying. ‘I had hoped the weather\nwould have been cooler by this time.’\n\n‘Did you ever go by water?’ said Knight.\n\n‘Never--by never, I mean not since the time of railways.’\n\n‘Then if you can afford an additional day, I propose that we do it,’\nsaid Knight. ‘The Channel is like a lake just now. We should reach\nPlymouth in about forty hours, I think, and the boats start from just\nbelow the bridge here’ (pointing over his shoulder eastward).\n\n‘Hear, hear!’ said the vicar.\n\n‘It’s an idea, certainly,’ said his wife.\n\n‘Of course these coasters are rather tubby,’ said Knight. ‘But you\nwouldn’t mind that?’\n\n‘No: we wouldn’t mind.’\n\n‘And the saloon is a place like the fishmarket of a ninth-rate country\ntown, but that wouldn’t matter?’\n\n‘Oh dear, no. If we had only thought of it soon enough, we might have\nhad the use of Lord Luxellian’s yacht. But never mind, we’ll go. We\nshall escape the worrying rattle through the whole length of London\nto-morrow morning--not to mention the risk of being killed by excursion\ntrains, which is not a little one at this time of the year, if the\npapers are true.’\n\nElfride, too, thought the arrangement delightful; and accordingly, ten\no’clock the following morning saw two cabs crawling round by the Mint,\nand between the preternaturally high walls of Nightingale Lane towards\nthe river side.\n\nThe first vehicle was occupied by the travellers in person, and the\nsecond brought up the luggage, under the supervision of Mrs. Snewson,\nMrs. Swancourt’s maid--and for the last fortnight Elfride’s also;\nfor although the younger lady had never been accustomed to any such\nattendant at robing times, her stepmother forced her into a semblance of\nfamiliarity with one when they were away from home.\n\nPresently waggons, bales, and smells of all descriptions increased to\nsuch an extent that the advance of the cabs was at the slowest possible\nrate. At intervals it was necessary to halt entirely, that the heavy\nvehicles unloading in front might be moved aside, a feat which was not\naccomplished without a deal of swearing and noise. The vicar put his\nhead out of the window.\n\n‘Surely there must be some mistake in the way,’ he said with great\nconcern, drawing in his head again. ‘There’s not a respectable\nconveyance to be seen here except ours. I’ve heard that there are\nstrange dens in this part of London, into which people have been\nentrapped and murdered--surely there is no conspiracy on the part of the\ncabman?’\n\n‘Oh no, no. It is all right,’ said Mr. Knight, who was as placid as dewy\neve by the side of Elfride.\n\n‘But what I argue from,’ said the vicar, with a greater emphasis of\nuneasiness, ‘are plain appearances. This can’t be the highway from\nLondon to Plymouth by water, because it is no way at all to any place.\nWe shall miss our steamer and our train too--that’s what I think.’\n\n‘Depend upon it we are right. In fact, here we are.’\n\n‘Trimmer’s Wharf,’ said the cabman, opening the door.\n\nNo sooner had they alighted than they perceived a tussle going on\nbetween the hindmost cabman and a crowd of light porters who had\ncharged him in column, to obtain possession of the bags and boxes, Mrs.\nSnewson’s hands being seen stretched towards heaven in the midst of the\nmelee. Knight advanced gallantly, and after a hard struggle reduced the\ncrowd to two, upon whose shoulders and trucks the goods vanished away in\nthe direction of the water’s edge with startling rapidity.\n\nThen more of the same tribe, who had run on ahead, were heard shouting\nto boatmen, three of whom pulled alongside, and two being vanquished,\nthe luggage went tumbling into the remaining one.\n\n‘Never saw such a dreadful scene in my life--never!’ said Mr. Swancourt,\nfloundering into the boat. ‘Worse than Famine and Sword upon one. I\nthought such customs were confined to continental ports. Aren’t you\nastonished, Elfride?’\n\n‘Oh no,’ said Elfride, appearing amid the dingy scene like a rainbow in\na murky sky. ‘It is a pleasant novelty, I think.’\n\n‘Where in the wide ocean is our steamer?’ the vicar inquired. ‘I can see\nnothing but old hulks, for the life of me.’\n\n‘Just behind that one,’ said Knight; ‘we shall soon be round under her.’\n\nThe object of their search was soon after disclosed to view--a great\nlumbering form of inky blackness, which looked as if it had never known\nthe touch of a paint-brush for fifty years. It was lying beside just\nsuch another, and the way on board was down a narrow lane of water\nbetween the two, about a yard and a half wide at one end, and gradually\nconverging to a point. At the moment of their entry into this narrow\npassage, a brilliantly painted rival paddled down the river like a\ntrotting steed, creating such a series of waves and splashes that\ntheir frail wherry was tossed like a teacup, and the vicar and his wife\nslanted this way and that, inclining their heads into contact with a\nPunch-and-Judy air and countenance, the wavelets striking the sides of\nthe two hulls, and flapping back into their laps.\n\n‘Dreadful! horrible!’ Mr. Swancourt murmured privately; and said aloud,\nI thought we walked on board. I don’t think really I should have come,\nif I had known this trouble was attached to it.’\n\n‘If they must splash, I wish they would splash us with clean water,’\nsaid the old lady, wiping her dress with her handkerchief.\n\n‘I hope it is perfectly safe,’ continued the vicar.\n\n‘O papa! you are not very brave,’ cried Elfride merrily.\n\n‘Bravery is only obtuseness to the perception of contingencies,’ Mr.\nSwancourt severely answered.\n\nMrs. Swancourt laughed, and Elfride laughed, and Knight laughed, in the\nmidst of which pleasantness a man shouted to them from some position\nbetween their heads and the sky, and they found they were close to the\nJuliet, into which they quiveringly ascended.\n\nIt having been found that the lowness of the tide would prevent their\ngetting off for an hour, the Swancourts, having nothing else to\ndo, allowed their eyes to idle upon men in blue jerseys performing\nmysterious mending operations with tar-twine; they turned to look at\nthe dashes of lurid sunlight, like burnished copper stars afloat on the\nripples, which danced into and tantalized their vision; or listened to\nthe loud music of a steam-crane at work close by; or to sighing sounds\nfrom the funnels of passing steamers, getting dead as they grew more\ndistant; or to shouts from the decks of different craft in their\nvicinity, all of them assuming the form of ‘Ah-he-hay!’\n\nHalf-past ten: not yet off. Mr. Swancourt breathed a breath of\nweariness, and looked at his fellow-travellers in general. Their faces\nwere certainly not worth looking at. The expression ‘Waiting’ was\nwritten upon them so absolutely that nothing more could be discerned\nthere. All animation was suspended till Providence should raise the\nwater and let them go.\n\n‘I have been thinking,’ said Knight, ‘that we have come amongst the\nrarest class of people in the kingdom. Of all human characteristics, a\nlow opinion of the value of his own time by an individual must be among\nthe strangest to find. Here we see numbers of that patient and happy\nspecies. Rovers, as distinct from travellers.’\n\n‘But they are pleasure-seekers, to whom time is of no importance.’\n\n‘Oh no. The pleasure-seekers we meet on the grand routes are more\nanxious than commercial travellers to rush on. And added to the loss of\ntime in getting to their journey’s end, these exceptional people take\ntheir chance of sea-sickness by coming this way.’\n\n‘Can it be?’ inquired the vicar with apprehension. ‘Surely not, Mr.\nKnight, just here in our English Channel--close at our doors, as I may\nsay.’\n\n‘Entrance passages are very draughty places, and the Channel is like\nthe rest. It ruins the temper of sailors. It has been calculated by\nphilosophers that more damns go up to heaven from the Channel, in the\ncourse of a year, than from all the five oceans put together.’\n\nThey really start now, and the dead looks of all the throng come to life\nimmediately. The man who has been frantically hauling in a rope that\nbade fair to have no end ceases his labours, and they glide down the\nserpentine bends of the Thames.\n\nAnything anywhere was a mine of interest to Elfride, and so was this.\n\n‘It is well enough now,’ said Mrs. Swancourt, after they had passed the\nNore, ‘but I can’t say I have cared for my voyage hitherto.’ For being\nnow in the open sea a slight breeze had sprung up, which cheered her as\nwell as her two younger companions. But unfortunately it had a reverse\neffect upon the vicar, who, after turning a sort of apricot jam colour,\ninterspersed with dashes of raspberry, pleaded indisposition, and\nvanished from their sight.\n\nThe afternoon wore on. Mrs. Swancourt kindly sat apart by herself\nreading, and the betrothed pair were left to themselves. Elfride clung\ntrustingly to Knight’s arm, and proud was she to walk with him up\nand down the deck, or to go forward, and leaning with him against the\nforecastle rails, watch the setting sun gradually withdrawing itself\nover their stern into a huge bank of livid cloud with golden edges that\nrose to meet it.\n\nShe was childishly full of life and spirits, though in walking up and\ndown with him before the other passengers, and getting noticed by them,\nshe was at starting rather confused, it being the first time she had\nshown herself so openly under that kind of protection. ‘I expect they\nare envious and saying things about us, don’t you?’ she would whisper to\nKnight with a stealthy smile.\n\n‘Oh no,’ he would answer unconcernedly. ‘Why should they envy us, and\nwhat can they say?’\n\n‘Not any harm, of course,’ Elfride replied, ‘except such as this: “How\nhappy those two are! she is proud enough now.” What makes it worse,’ she\ncontinued in the extremity of confidence, ‘I heard those two cricketing\nmen say just now, “She’s the nobbiest girl on the boat.” But I don’t\nmind it, you know, Harry.’\n\n‘I should hardly have supposed you did, even if you had not told me,’\nsaid Knight with great blandness.\n\nShe was never tired of asking her lover questions and admiring his\nanswers, good, bad, or indifferent as they might be. The evening grew\ndark and night came on, and lights shone upon them from the horizon and\nfrom the sky.\n\n‘Now look there ahead of us, at that halo in the air, of silvery\nbrightness. Watch it, and you will see what it comes to.’\n\nShe watched for a few minutes, when two white lights emerged from the\nside of a hill, and showed themselves to be the origin of the halo.\n\n‘What a dazzling brilliance! What do they mark?’\n\n‘The South Foreland: they were previously covered by the cliff.’\n\n‘What is that level line of little sparkles--a town, I suppose?’\n\n‘That’s Dover.’\n\nAll this time, and later, soft sheet lightning expanded from a cloud in\ntheir path, enkindling their faces as they paced up and down, shining\nover the water, and, for a moment, showing the horizon as a keen line.\n\nElfride slept soundly that night. Her first thought the next morning was\nthe thrilling one that Knight was as close at hand as when they were\nat home at Endelstow, and her first sight, on looking out of the cabin\nwindow, was the perpendicular face of Beachy Head, gleaming white in a\nbrilliant six-o’clock-in-the-morning sun. This fair daybreak, however,\nsoon changed its aspect. A cold wind and a pale mist descended upon the\nsea, and seemed to threaten a dreary day.\n\nWhen they were nearing Southampton, Mrs. Swancourt came to say that her\nhusband was so ill that he wished to be put on shore here, and left\nto do the remainder of the journey by land. ‘He will be perfectly well\ndirectly he treads firm ground again. Which shall we do--go with him, or\nfinish our voyage as we intended?’\n\nElfride was comfortably housed under an umbrella which Knight was\nholding over her to keep off the wind. ‘Oh, don’t let us go on shore!’\nshe said with dismay. ‘It would be such a pity!’\n\n‘That’s very fine,’ said Mrs. Swancourt archly, as to a child. ‘See,\nthe wind has increased her colour, the sea her appetite and spirits, and\nsomebody her happiness. Yes, it would be a pity, certainly.’\n\n‘’Tis my misfortune to be always spoken to from a pedestal,’ sighed\nElfride.\n\n‘Well, we will do as you like, Mrs. Swancourt,’ said Knight, ‘but----’\n\n‘I myself would rather remain on board,’ interrupted the elder lady.\n‘And Mr. Swancourt particularly wishes to go by himself. So that shall\nsettle the matter.’\n\nThe vicar, now a drab colour, was put ashore, and became as well as ever\nforthwith.\n\nElfride, sitting alone in a retired part of the vessel, saw a veiled\nwoman walk aboard among the very latest arrivals at this port. She was\nclothed in black silk, and carried a dark shawl upon her arm. The\nwoman, without looking around her, turned to the quarter allotted to\nthe second-cabin passengers. All the carnation Mrs. Swancourt had\ncomplimented her step-daughter upon possessing left Elfride’s cheeks,\nand she trembled visibly.\n\nShe ran to the other side of the boat, where Mrs. Swancourt was\nstanding.\n\n‘Let us go home by railway with papa, after all,’ she pleaded earnestly.\n‘I would rather go with him--shall we?’\n\nMrs. Swancourt looked around for a moment, as if unable to decide. ‘Ah,’\nshe exclaimed, ‘it is too late now. Why did not you say so before, when\nwe had plenty of time?’\n\nThe Juliet had at that minute let go, the engines had started, and they\nwere gliding slowly away from the quay. There was no help for it but\nto remain, unless the Juliet could be made to put back, and that would\ncreate a great disturbance. Elfride gave up the idea and submitted\nquietly. Her happiness was sadly mutilated now.\n\nThe woman whose presence had so disturbed her was exactly like Mrs.\nJethway. She seemed to haunt Elfride like a shadow. After several\nminutes’ vain endeavour to account for any design Mrs. Jethway could\nhave in watching her, Elfride decided to think that, if it were the\nwidow, the encounter was accidental. She remembered that the widow in\nher restlessness was often visiting the village near Southampton, which\nwas her original home, and it was possible that she chose water-transit\nwith the idea of saving expense.\n\n‘What is the matter, Elfride?’ Knight inquired, standing before her.\n\n‘Nothing more than that I am rather depressed.’\n\n‘I don’t much wonder at it; that wharf was depressing. We seemed\nunderneath and inferior to everything around us. But we shall be in the\nsea breeze again soon, and that will freshen you, dear.’\n\nThe evening closed in and dusk increased as they made way down\nSouthampton Water and through the Solent. Elfride’s disturbance of mind\nwas such that her light spirits of the foregoing four and twenty hours\nhad entirely deserted her. The weather too had grown more gloomy, for\nthough the showers of the morning had ceased, the sky was covered more\nclosely than ever with dense leaden clouds. How beautiful was the sunset\nwhen they rounded the North Foreland the previous evening! now it was\nimpossible to tell within half an hour the time of the luminary’s going\ndown. Knight led her about, and being by this time accustomed to her\nsudden changes of mood, overlooked the necessity of a cause in regarding\nthe conditions--impressionableness and elasticity.\n\nElfride looked stealthily to the other end of the vessel. Mrs. Jethway,\nor her double, was sitting at the stern--her eye steadily regarding\nElfride.\n\n‘Let us go to the forepart,’ she said quickly to Knight. ‘See there--the\nman is fixing the lights for the night.’\n\nKnight assented, and after watching the operation of fixing the red and\nthe green lights on the port and starboard bows, and the hoisting of\nthe white light to the masthead, he walked up and down with her till\nthe increase of wind rendered promenading difficult. Elfride’s eyes were\noccasionally to be found furtively gazing abaft, to learn if her enemy\nwere really there. Nobody was visible now.\n\n‘Shall we go below?’ said Knight, seeing that the deck was nearly\ndeserted.\n\n‘No,’ she said. ‘If you will kindly get me a rug from Mrs. Swancourt, I\nshould like, if you don’t mind, to stay here.’ She had recently fancied\nthe assumed Mrs. Jethway might be a first-class passenger, and dreaded\nmeeting her by accident.\n\nKnight appeared with the rug, and they sat down behind a weather-cloth\non the windward side, just as the two red eyes of the Needles glared\nupon them from the gloom, their pointed summits rising like shadowy\nphantom figures against the sky. It became necessary to go below to\nan eight-o’clock meal of nondescript kind, and Elfride was immensely\nrelieved at finding no sign of Mrs. Jethway there. They again ascended,\nand remained above till Mrs. Snewson staggered up to them with the\nmessage that Mrs. Swancourt thought it was time for Elfride to come\nbelow. Knight accompanied her down, and returned again to pass a little\nmore time on deck.\n\nElfride partly undressed herself and lay down, and soon became\nunconscious, though her sleep was light. How long she had lain, she knew\nnot, when by slow degrees she became cognizant of a whispering in her\near.\n\n‘You are well on with him, I can see. Well, provoke me now, but my day\nwill come, you will find.’ That seemed to be the utterance, or words to\nthat effect.\n\nElfride became broad awake and terrified. She knew the words, if real,\ncould be only those of one person, and that person the widow Jethway.\n\nThe lamp had gone out and the place was in darkness. In the next berth\nshe could hear her stepmother breathing heavily, further on Snewson\nbreathing more heavily still. These were the only other legitimate\noccupants of the cabin, and Mrs. Jethway must have stealthily come in by\nsome means and retreated again, or else she had entered an empty berth\nnext Snewson’s. The fear that this was the case increased Elfride’s\nperturbation, till it assumed the dimensions of a certainty, for how\ncould a stranger from the other end of the ship possibly contrive to get\nin? Could it have been a dream?\n\nElfride raised herself higher and looked out of the window. There was\nthe sea, floundering and rushing against the ship’s side just by her\nhead, and thence stretching away, dim and moaning, into an expanse of\nindistinctness; and far beyond all this two placid lights like rayless\nstars. Now almost fearing to turn her face inwards again, lest Mrs.\nJethway should appear at her elbow, Elfride meditated upon whether to\ncall Snewson to keep her company. ‘Four bells’ sounded, and she heard\nvoices, which gave her a little courage. It was not worth while to call\nSnewson.\n\nAt any rate Elfride could not stay there panting longer, at the risk of\nbeing again disturbed by that dreadful whispering. So wrapping herself\nup hurriedly she emerged into the passage, and by the aid of a faint\nlight burning at the entrance to the saloon found the foot of the\nstairs, and ascended to the deck. Dreary the place was in the extreme.\nIt seemed a new spot altogether in contrast with its daytime self. She\ncould see the glowworm light from the binnacle, and the dim outline\nof the man at the wheel; also a form at the bows. Not another soul was\napparent from stem to stern.\n\nYes, there were two more--by the bulwarks. One proved to be her Harry,\nthe other the mate. She was glad indeed, and on drawing closer found\nthey were holding a low slow chat about nautical affairs. She ran up\nand slipped her hand through Knight’s arm, partly for love, partly for\nstability.\n\n‘Elfie! not asleep?’ said Knight, after moving a few steps aside with\nher.\n\n‘No: I cannot sleep. May I stay here? It is so dismal down there,\nand--and I was afraid. Where are we now?’\n\n‘Due south of Portland Bill. Those are the lights abeam of us: look.\nA terrible spot, that, on a stormy night. And do you see a very small\nlight that dips and rises to the right? That’s a light-ship on the\ndangerous shoal called the Shambles, where many a good vessel has\ngone to pieces. Between it and ourselves is the Race--a place where\nantagonistic currents meet and form whirlpools--a spot which is rough in\nthe smoothest weather, and terrific in a wind. That dark, dreary horizon\nwe just discern to the left is the West Bay, terminated landwards by the\nChesil Beach.’\n\n‘What time is it, Harry?’\n\n‘Just past two.’\n\n‘Are you going below?’\n\n‘Oh no; not to-night. I prefer pure air.’\n\nShe fancied he might be displeased with her for coming to him at this\nunearthly hour. ‘I should like to stay here too, if you will allow me,’\nshe said timidly.\n\n‘I want to ask you things.’\n\n‘Allow you, Elfie!’ said Knight, putting his arm round her and drawing\nher closer. ‘I am twice as happy with you by my side. Yes: we will stay,\nand watch the approach of day.’\n\nSo they again sought out the sheltered nook, and sitting down wrapped\nthemselves in the rug as before.\n\n‘What were you going to ask me?’ he inquired, as they undulated up and\ndown.\n\n‘Oh, it was not much--perhaps a thing I ought not to ask,’ she said\nhesitatingly. Her sudden wish had really been to discover at once\nwhether he had ever before been engaged to be married. If he had, she\nwould make that a ground for telling him a little of her conduct with\nStephen. Mrs. Jethway’s seeming words had so depressed the girl that\nshe herself now painted her flight in the darkest colours, and longed to\nease her burdened mind by an instant confession. If Knight had ever been\nimprudent himself, he might, she hoped, forgive all.\n\n‘I wanted to ask you,’ she went on, ‘if--you had ever been engaged\nbefore.’ She added tremulously, ‘I hope you have--I mean, I don’t mind\nat all if you have.’\n\n‘No, I never was,’ Knight instantly and heartily replied. ‘Elfride’--and\nthere was a certain happy pride in his tone--‘I am twelve years older\nthan you, and I have been about the world, and, in a way, into society,\nand you have not. And yet I am not so unfit for you as strict-thinking\npeople might imagine, who would assume the difference in age to signify\nmost surely an equal addition to my practice in love-making.’\n\nElfride shivered.\n\n‘You are cold--is the wind too much for you?’\n\n‘No,’ she said gloomily. The belief which had been her sheet-anchor in\nhoping for forgiveness had proved false. This account of the exceptional\nnature of his experience, a matter which would have set her rejoicing\ntwo years ago, chilled her now like a frost.\n\n‘You don’t mind my asking you?’ she continued.\n\n‘Oh no--not at all.’\n\n‘And have you never kissed many ladies?’ she whispered, hoping he would\nsay a hundred at the least.\n\nThe time, the circumstances, and the scene were such as to draw\nconfidences from the most reserved. ‘Elfride,’ whispered Knight in\nreply, ‘it is strange you should have asked that question. But I’ll\nanswer it, though I have never told such a thing before. I have been\nrather absurd in my avoidance of women. I have never given a woman a\nkiss in my life, except yourself and my mother.’ The man of two and\nthirty with the experienced mind warmed all over with a boy’s ingenuous\nshame as he made the confession.\n\n‘What, not one?’ she faltered.\n\n‘No; not one.’\n\n‘How very strange!’\n\n‘Yes, the reverse experience may be commoner. And yet, to those who have\nobserved their own sex, as I have, my case is not remarkable. Men about\ntown are women’s favourites--that’s the postulate--and superficial\npeople don’t think far enough to see that there may be reserved, lonely\nexceptions.’\n\n‘Are you proud of it, Harry?’\n\n‘No, indeed. Of late years I have wished I had gone my ways and trod out\nmy measure like lighter-hearted men. I have thought of how many happy\nexperiences I may have lost through never going to woo.’\n\n‘Then why did you hold aloof?’\n\n‘I cannot say. I don’t think it was my nature to: circumstance hindered\nme, perhaps. I have regretted it for another reason. This great\nremissness of mine has had its effect upon me. The older I have grown,\nthe more distinctly have I perceived that it was absolutely preventing\nme from liking any woman who was not as unpractised as I; and I gave up\nthe expectation of finding a nineteenth-century young lady in my own raw\nstate. Then I found you, Elfride, and I felt for the first time that my\nfastidiousness was a blessing. And it helped to make me worthy of you.\nI felt at once that, differing as we did in other experiences, in this\nmatter I resembled you. Well, aren’t you glad to hear it, Elfride?’\n\n‘Yes, I am,’ she answered in a forced voice. ‘But I always had thought\nthat men made lots of engagements before they married--especially if\nthey don’t marry very young.’\n\n‘So all women think, I suppose--and rightly, indeed, of the majority of\nbachelors, as I said before. But an appreciable minority of slow-coach\nmen do not--and it makes them very awkward when they do come to the\npoint. However, it didn’t matter in my case.’\n\n‘Why?’ she asked uneasily.\n\n‘Because you know even less of love-making and matrimonial\nprearrangement than I, and so you can’t draw invidious comparisons if I\ndo my engaging improperly.’\n\n‘I think you do it beautifully!’\n\n‘Thank you, dear. But,’ continued Knight laughingly, ‘your opinion is\nnot that of an expert, which alone is of value.’\n\nHad she answered, ‘Yes, it is,’ half as strongly as she felt it, Knight\nmight have been a little astonished.\n\n‘If you had ever been engaged to be married before,’ he went on, ‘I\nexpect your opinion of my addresses would be different. But then, I\nshould not----’\n\n‘Should not what, Harry?’\n\n‘Oh, I was merely going to say that in that case I should never have\ngiven myself the pleasure of proposing to you, since your freedom from\nthat experience was your attraction, darling.’\n\n‘You are severe on women, are you not?’\n\n‘No, I think not. I had a right to please my taste, and that was for\nuntried lips. Other men than those of my sort acquire the taste as they\nget older--but don’t find an Elfride----’\n\n‘What horrid sound is that we hear when we pitch forward?’\n\n‘Only the screw--don’t find an Elfride as I did. To think that I should\nhave discovered such an unseen flower down there in the West--to whom a\nman is as much as a multitude to some women, and a trip down the English\nChannel like a voyage round the world!’\n\n‘And would you,’ she said, and her voice was tremulous, ‘have given up\na lady--if you had become engaged to her--and then found she had had ONE\nkiss before yours--and would you have--gone away and left her?’\n\n‘One kiss,--no, hardly for that.’\n\n‘Two?’\n\n‘Well--I could hardly say inventorially like that. Too much of that sort\nof thing certainly would make me dislike a woman. But let us confine our\nattention to ourselves, not go thinking of might have beens.’\n\nSo Elfride had allowed her thoughts to ‘dally with false surmise,’ and\nevery one of Knight’s words fell upon her like a weight. After this they\nwere silent for a long time, gazing upon the black mysterious sea, and\nhearing the strange voice of the restless wind. A rocking to and fro\non the waves, when the breeze is not too violent and cold, produces a\nsoothing effect even upon the most highly-wrought mind. Elfride slowly\nsank against Knight, and looking down, he found by her soft regular\nbreathing that she had fallen asleep. Not wishing to disturb her, he\ncontinued still, and took an intense pleasure in supporting her warm\nyoung form as it rose and fell with her every breath.\n\nKnight fell to dreaming too, though he continued wide awake. It was\npleasant to realize the implicit trust she placed in him, and to think\nof the charming innocence of one who could sink to sleep in so simple\nand unceremonious a manner. More than all, the musing unpractical\nstudent felt the immense responsibility he was taking upon himself by\nbecoming the protector and guide of such a trusting creature. The quiet\nslumber of her soul lent a quietness to his own. Then she moaned, and\nturned herself restlessly. Presently her mutterings became distinct:\n\n‘Don’t tell him--he will not love me....I did not mean any\ndisgrace--indeed I did not, so don’t tell Harry. We were going to be\nmarried--that was why I ran away....And he says he will not have a\nkissed woman....And if you tell him he will go away, and I shall die. I\npray have mercy--Oh!’\n\nElfride started up wildly.\n\nThe previous moment a musical ding-dong had spread into the air from\ntheir right hand, and awakened her.\n\n‘What is it?’ she exclaimed in terror.\n\n‘Only “eight bells,”’ said Knight soothingly. ‘Don’t be frightened,\nlittle bird, you are safe. What have you been dreaming about?’\n\n‘I can’t tell, I can’t tell!’ she said with a shudder. ‘Oh, I don’t know\nwhat to do!’\n\n‘Stay quietly with me. We shall soon see the dawn now. Look, the morning\nstar is lovely over there. The clouds have completely cleared off whilst\nyou have been sleeping. What have you been dreaming of?’\n\n‘A woman in our parish.’\n\n‘Don’t you like her?’\n\n‘I don’t. She doesn’t like me. Where are we?’\n\n‘About south of the Exe.’\n\nKnight said no more on the words of her dream. They watched the sky\ntill Elfride grew calm, and the dawn appeared. It was mere wan lightness\nfirst. Then the wind blew in a changed spirit, and died away to a\nzephyr. The star dissolved into the day.\n\n‘That’s how I should like to die,’ said Elfride, rising from her seat\nand leaning over the bulwark to watch the star’s last expiring gleam.\n\n‘As the lines say,’ Knight replied----\n\n\n    ‘“To set as sets the morning star, which goes\n      Not down behind the darken’d west, nor hides\n      Obscured among the tempests of the sky,\n      But melts away into the light of heaven.”’\n\n\n‘Oh, other people have thought the same thing, have they? That’s always\nthe case with my originalities--they are original to nobody but myself.’\n\n‘Not only the case with yours. When I was a young hand at reviewing\nI used to find that a frightful pitfall--dilating upon subjects I met\nwith, which were novelties to me, and finding afterwards they had been\nexhausted by the thinking world when I was in pinafores.’\n\n‘That is delightful. Whenever I find you have done a foolish thing I am\nglad, because it seems to bring you a little nearer to me, who have done\nmany.’ And Elfride thought again of her enemy asleep under the deck they\ntrod.\n\nAll up the coast, prominences singled themselves out from recesses. Then\na rosy sky spread over the eastern sea and behind the low line of\nland, flinging its livery in dashes upon the thin airy clouds in that\ndirection. Every projection on the land seemed now so many fingers\nanxious to catch a little of the liquid light thrown so prodigally over\nthe sky, and after a fantastic time of lustrous yellows in the east, the\nhigher elevations along the shore were flooded with the same hues. The\nbluff and bare contours of Start Point caught the brightest, earliest\nglow of all, and so also did the sides of its white lighthouse, perched\nupon a shelf in its precipitous front like a mediaeval saint in a niche.\nTheir lofty neighbour Bolt Head on the left remained as yet ungilded,\nand retained its gray.\n\nThen up came the sun, as it were in jerks, just to seaward of the\neasternmost point of land, flinging out a Jacob’s-ladder path of light\nfrom itself to Elfride and Knight, and coating them with rays in a few\nminutes. The inferior dignitaries of the shore--Froward Point, Berry\nHead, and Prawle--all had acquired their share of the illumination ere\nthis, and at length the very smallest protuberance of wave, cliff, or\ninlet, even to the innermost recesses of the lovely valley of the Dart,\nhad its portion; and sunlight, now the common possession of all, ceased\nto be the wonderful and coveted thing it had been a short half hour\nbefore.\n\nAfter breakfast, Plymouth arose into view, and grew distincter to their\nnearing vision, the Breakwater appearing like a streak of phosphoric\nlight upon the surface of the sea. Elfride looked furtively around for\nMrs. Jethway, but could discern no shape like hers. Afterwards, in the\nbustle of landing, she looked again with the same result, by which time\nthe woman had probably glided upon the quay unobserved. Expanding with\na sense of relief, Elfride waited whilst Knight looked to their luggage,\nand then saw her father approaching through the crowd, twirling his\nwalking-stick to catch their attention. Elbowing their way to him they\nall entered the town, which smiled as sunny a smile upon Elfride as it\nhad done between one and two years earlier, when she had entered it at\nprecisely the same hour as the bride-elect of Stephen Smith.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXX\n\n    ‘Vassal unto Love.’\n\n\nElfride clung closer to Knight as day succeeded day. Whatever else might\nadmit of question, there could be no dispute that the allegiance she\nbore him absorbed her whole soul and existence. A greater than Stephen\nhad arisen, and she had left all to follow him.\n\nThe unreserved girl was never chary of letting her lover discover how\nmuch she admired him. She never once held an idea in opposition to\nany one of his, or insisted on any point with him, or showed any\nindependence, or held her own on any subject. His lightest whim she\nrespected and obeyed as law, and if, expressing her opinion on a matter,\nhe took up the subject and differed from her, she instantly threw\ndown her own opinion as wrong and untenable. Even her ambiguities and\nespieglerie were but media of the same manifestation; acted charades,\nembodying the words of her prototype, the tender and susceptible\ndaughter-in-law of Naomi: ‘Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for\nthat thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto\nthine handmaid.’\n\nShe was syringing the plants one wet day in the greenhouse. Knight was\nsitting under a great passion-flower observing the scene. Sometimes he\nlooked out at the rain from the sky, and then at Elfride’s inner rain of\nlarger drops, which fell from trees and shrubs, after having previously\nhung from the twigs like small silver fruit.\n\n‘I must give you something to make you think of me during this autumn\nat your chambers,’ she was saying. ‘What shall it be? Portraits do more\nharm than good, by selecting the worst expression of which your face is\ncapable. Hair is unlucky. And you don’t like jewellery.’\n\n‘Something which shall bring back to my mind the many scenes we have\nenacted in this conservatory. I see what I should prize very much. That\ndwarf myrtle tree in the pot, which you have been so carefully tending.’\n\nElfride looked thoughtfully at the myrtle.\n\n‘I can carry it comfortably in my hat box,’ said Knight. ‘And I will put\nit in my window, and so, it being always before my eyes, I shall think\nof you continually.’\n\nIt so happened that the myrtle which Knight had singled out had a\npeculiar beginning and history. It had originally been a twig worn in\nStephen Smith’s button-hole, and he had taken it thence, stuck it into\nthe pot, and told her that if it grew, she was to take care of it, and\nkeep it in remembrance of him when he was far away.\n\nShe looked wistfully at the plant, and a sense of fairness to Smith’s\nmemory caused her a pang of regret that Knight should have asked for\nthat very one. It seemed exceeding a common heartlessness to let it go.\n\n‘Is there not anything you like better?’ she said sadly. ‘That is only\nan ordinary myrtle.’\n\n‘No: I am fond of myrtle.’ Seeing that she did not take kindly to the\nidea, he said again, ‘Why do you object to my having that?’\n\n‘Oh no--I don’t object precisely--it was a feeling.--Ah, here’s another\ncutting lately struck, and just as small--of a better kind, and with\nprettier leaves--myrtus microphylla.’\n\n‘That will do nicely. Let it be put in my room, that I may not forget\nit. What romance attaches to the other?’\n\n‘It was a gift to me.’\n\nThe subject then dropped. Knight thought no more of the matter till, on\nentering his bedroom in the evening, he found the second myrtle placed\nupon his dressing-table as he had directed. He stood for a moment\nadmiring the fresh appearance of the leaves by candlelight, and then he\nthought of the transaction of the day.\n\nMale lovers as well as female can be spoilt by too much kindness, and\nElfride’s uniform submissiveness had given Knight a rather exacting\nmanner at crises, attached to her as he was. ‘Why should she have\nrefused the one I first chose?’ he now asked himself. Even such slight\nopposition as she had shown then was exceptional enough to make itself\nnoticeable. He was not vexed with her in the least: the mere variation\nof her way to-day from her usual ways kept him musing on the subject,\nbecause it perplexed him. ‘It was a gift’--those were her words.\nAdmitting it to be a gift, he thought she could hardly value a mere\nfriend more than she valued him as a lover, and giving the plant into\nhis charge would have made no difference. ‘Except, indeed, it was the\ngift of a lover,’ he murmured.\n\n‘I wonder if Elfride has ever had a lover before?’ he said aloud, as a\nnew idea, quite. This and companion thoughts were enough to occupy him\ncompletely till he fell asleep--rather later than usual.\n\nThe next day, when they were again alone, he said to her rather\nsuddenly--\n\n‘Do you love me more or less, Elfie, for what I told you on board the\nsteamer?’\n\n‘You told me so many things,’ she returned, lifting her eyes to his and\nsmiling.\n\n‘I mean the confession you coaxed out of me--that I had never been in\nthe position of lover before.’\n\n‘It is a satisfaction, I suppose, to be the first in your heart,’ she\nsaid to him, with an attempt to continue her smiling.\n\n‘I am going to ask you a question now,’ said Knight, somewhat awkwardly.\n‘I only ask it in a whimsical way, you know: not with great seriousness,\nElfride. You may think it odd, perhaps.’\n\nElfride tried desperately to keep the colour in her face. She could not,\nthough distressed to think that getting pale showed consciousness of\ndeeper guilt than merely getting red.\n\n‘Oh no--I shall not think that,’ she said, because obliged to say\nsomething to fill the pause which followed her questioner’s remark.\n\n‘It is this: have you ever had a lover? I am almost sure you have not;\nbut, have you?’\n\n‘Not, as it were, a lover; I mean, not worth mentioning, Harry,’ she\nfaltered.\n\nKnight, overstrained in sentiment as he knew the feeling to be, felt\nsome sickness of heart.\n\n‘Still, he was a lover?’\n\n‘Well, a sort of lover, I suppose,’ she responded tardily.\n\n‘A man, I mean, you know.’\n\n‘Yes; but only a mere person, and----’\n\n‘But truly your lover?’\n\n‘Yes; a lover certainly--he was that. Yes, he might have been called my\nlover.’\n\nKnight said nothing to this for a minute or more, and kept silent time\nwith his finger to the tick of the old library clock, in which room the\ncolloquy was going on.\n\n‘You don’t mind, Harry, do you?’ she said anxiously, nestling close to\nhim, and watching his face.\n\n‘Of course, I don’t seriously mind. In reason, a man cannot object to\nsuch a trifle. I only thought you hadn’t--that was all.’\n\nHowever, one ray was abstracted from the glory about her head. But\nafterwards, when Knight was wandering by himself over the bare and\nbreezy hills, and meditating on the subject, that ray suddenly returned.\nFor she might have had a lover, and never have cared in the least for\nhim. She might have used the word improperly, and meant ‘admirer’ all\nthe time. Of course she had been admired; and one man might have made\nhis admiration more prominent than that of the rest--a very natural\ncase.\n\nThey were sitting on one of the garden seats when he found occasion to\nput the supposition to the test. ‘Did you love that lover or admirer of\nyours ever so little, Elfie?’\n\nShe murmured reluctantly, ‘Yes, I think I did.’\n\nKnight felt the same faint touch of misery. ‘Only a very little?’ he\nsaid.\n\n‘I am not sure how much.’\n\n‘But you are sure, darling, you loved him a little?’\n\n‘I think I am sure I loved him a little.’\n\n‘And not a great deal, Elfie?’\n\n‘My love was not supported by reverence for his powers.’\n\n‘But, Elfride, did you love him deeply?’ said Knight restlessly.\n\n‘I don’t exactly know how deep you mean by deeply.’\n\n‘That’s nonsense.’\n\n‘You misapprehend; and you have let go my hand!’ she cried, her eyes\nfilling with tears. ‘Harry, don’t be severe with me, and don’t question\nme. I did not love him as I do you. And could it be deeply if I did\nnot think him cleverer than myself? For I did not. You grieve me so\nmuch--you can’t think.’\n\n‘I will not say another word about it.’\n\n‘And you will not think about it, either, will you? I know you think of\nweaknesses in me after I am out of your sight; and not knowing what they\nare, I cannot combat them. I almost wish you were of a grosser nature,\nHarry; in truth I do! Or rather, I wish I could have the advantages such\na nature in you would afford me, and yet have you as you are.’\n\n‘What advantages would they be?’\n\n‘Less anxiety, and more security. Ordinary men are not so delicate in\ntheir tastes as you; and where the lover or husband is not fastidious,\nand refined, and of a deep nature, things seem to go on better, I\nfancy--as far as I have been able to observe the world.’\n\n‘Yes; I suppose it is right. Shallowness has this advantage, that you\ncan’t be drowned there.’\n\n‘But I think I’ll have you as you are; yes, I will!’ she said winsomely.\n‘The practical husbands and wives who take things philosophically are\nvery humdrum, are they not? Yes, it would kill me quite. You please me\nbest as you are.’\n\n‘Even though I wish you had never cared for one before me?’\n\n‘Yes. And you must not wish it. Don’t!’\n\n‘I’ll try not to, Elfride.’\n\nSo she hoped, but her heart was troubled. If he felt so deeply on this\npoint, what would he say did he know all, and see it as Mrs. Jethway saw\nit? He would never make her the happiest girl in the world by taking her\nto be his own for aye. The thought enclosed her as a tomb whenever it\npresented itself to her perturbed brain. She tried to believe that Mrs.\nJethway would never do her such a cruel wrong as to increase the bad\nappearance of her folly by innuendoes; and concluded that concealment,\nhaving been begun, must be persisted in, if possible. For what he might\nconsider as bad as the fact, was her previous concealment of it by\nstrategy.\n\nBut Elfride knew Mrs. Jethway to be her enemy, and to hate her. It was\npossible she would do her worst. And should she do it, all might be\nover.\n\nWould the woman listen to reason, and be persuaded not to ruin one who\nhad never intentionally harmed her?\n\n\n\nIt was night in the valley between Endelstow Crags and the shore. The\nbrook which trickled that way to the sea was distinct in its murmurs\nnow, and over the line of its course there began to hang a white riband\nof fog. Against the sky, on the left hand of the vale, the black form of\nthe church could be seen. On the other rose hazel-bushes, a few trees,\nand where these were absent, furze tufts--as tall as men--on stems\nnearly as stout as timber. The shriek of some bird was occasionally\nheard, as it flew terror-stricken from its first roost, to seek a new\nsleeping-place, where it might pass the night unmolested.\n\nIn the evening shade, some way down the valley, and under a row of\nscrubby oaks, a cottage could still be discerned. It stood absolutely\nalone. The house was rather large, and the windows of some of the rooms\nwere nailed up with boards on the outside, which gave a particularly\ndeserted appearance to the whole erection. From the front door an\nirregular series of rough and misshapen steps, cut in the solid rock,\nled down to the edge of the streamlet, which, at their extremity,\nwas hollowed into a basin through which the water trickled. This was\nevidently the means of water supply to the dweller or dwellers in the\ncottage.\n\nA light footstep was heard descending from the higher slopes of the\nhillside. Indistinct in the pathway appeared a moving female shape, who\nadvanced and knocked timidly at the door. No answer being returned the\nknock was repeated, with the same result, and it was then repeated a\nthird time. This also was unsuccessful.\n\nFrom one of the only two windows on the ground floor which were not\nboarded up came rays of light, no shutter or curtain obscuring the room\nfrom the eyes of a passer on the outside. So few walked that way after\nnightfall that any such means to secure secrecy were probably deemed\nunnecessary.\n\nThe inequality of the rays falling upon the trees outside told that the\nlight had its origin in a flickering fire only. The visitor, after the\nthird knocking, stepped a little to the left in order to gain a view of\nthe interior, and threw back the hood from her face. The dancing yellow\nsheen revealed the fair and anxious countenance of Elfride.\n\nInside the house this firelight was enough to illumine the room\ndistinctly, and to show that the furniture of the cottage was superior\nto what might have been expected from so unpromising an exterior. It\nalso showed to Elfride that the room was empty. Beyond the light quiver\nand flap of the flames nothing moved or was audible therein.\n\nShe turned the handle and entered, throwing off the cloak which\nenveloped her, under which she appeared without hat or bonnet, and\nin the sort of half-toilette country people ordinarily dine in. Then\nadvancing to the foot of the staircase she called distinctly, but\nsomewhat fearfully, ‘Mrs. Jethway!’\n\nNo answer.\n\nWith a look of relief and regret combined, denoting that ease came to\nthe heart and disappointment to the brain, Elfride paused for several\nminutes, as if undecided how to act. Determining to wait, she sat down\non a chair. The minutes drew on, and after sitting on the thorns of\nimpatience for half an hour, she searched her pocket, took therefrom a\nletter, and tore off the blank leaf. Then taking out a pencil she wrote\nupon the paper:\n\n\n‘DEAR MRS. JETHWAY,--I have been to visit you. I wanted much to see\nyou, but I cannot wait any longer. I came to beg you not to execute the\nthreats you have repeated to me. Do not, I beseech you, Mrs. Jethway,\nlet any one know I ran away from home! It would ruin me with him, and\nbreak my heart. I will do anything for you, if you will be kind to\nme. In the name of our common womanhood, do not, I implore you, make a\nscandal of me.--Yours, E. SWANCOURT.’\n\n\nShe folded the note cornerwise, directed it, and placed it on the table.\nThen again drawing the hood over her curly head she emerged silently as\nshe had come.\n\nWhilst this episode had been in action at Mrs. Jethway’s cottage, Knight\nhad gone from the dining-room into the drawing-room, and found Mrs.\nSwancourt there alone.\n\n‘Elfride has vanished upstairs or somewhere,’ she said.\n\n‘And I have been reading an article in an old number of the PRESENT that\nI lighted on by chance a short time ago; it is an article you once told\nus was yours. Well, Harry, with due deference to your literary powers,\nallow me to say that this effusion is all nonsense, in my opinion.’\n\n‘What is it about?’ said Knight, taking up the paper and reading.\n\n‘There: don’t get red about it. Own that experience has taught you to\nbe more charitable. I have never read such unchivalrous sentiments in my\nlife--from a man, I mean. There, I forgive you; it was before you knew\nElfride.’\n\n‘Oh yes,’ said Knight, looking up. ‘I remember now. The text of that\nsermon was not my own at all, but was suggested to me by a young man\nnamed Smith--the same whom I have mentioned to you as coming from this\nparish. I thought the idea rather ingenious at the time, and enlarged it\nto the weight of a few guineas, because I had nothing else in my head.’\n\n‘Which idea do you call the text? I am curious to know that.’\n\n‘Well, this,’ said Knight, somewhat unwillingly. ‘That experience\nteaches, and your sweetheart, no less than your tailor, is necessarily\nvery imperfect in her duties, if you are her first patron: and\nconversely, the sweetheart who is graceful under the initial kiss must\nbe supposed to have had some practice in the trade.’\n\n‘And do you mean to say that you wrote that upon the strength of another\nman’s remark, without having tested it by practice?’\n\n‘Yes--indeed I do.’\n\n‘Then I think it was uncalled for and unfair. And how do you know it is\ntrue? I expect you regret it now.’\n\n‘Since you bring me into a serious mood, I will speak candidly. I do\nbelieve that remark to be perfectly true, and, having written it, I\nwould defend it anywhere. But I do often regret having ever written it,\nas well as others of the sort. I have grown older since, and I find such\na tone of writing is calculated to do harm in the world. Every literary\nJack becomes a gentleman if he can only pen a few indifferent satires\nupon womankind: women themselves, too, have taken to the trick; and so,\nupon the whole, I begin to be rather ashamed of my companions.’\n\n‘Ah, Henry, you have fallen in love since and it makes a difference,’\nsaid Mrs. Swancourt with a faint tone of banter.\n\n‘That’s true; but that is not my reason.’\n\n‘Having found that, in a case of your own experience, a so-called goose\nwas a swan, it seems absurd to deny such a possibility in other men’s\nexperiences.’\n\n‘You can hit palpably, cousin Charlotte,’ said Knight. ‘You are like the\nboy who puts a stone inside his snowball, and I shall play with you no\nlonger. Excuse me--I am going for my evening stroll.’\n\nThough Knight had spoken jestingly, this incident and conversation had\ncaused him a sudden depression. Coming, rather singularly, just after\nhis discovery that Elfride had known what it was to love warmly before\nshe had known him, his mind dwelt upon the subject, and the familiar\npipe he smoked, whilst pacing up and down the shrubbery-path, failed\nto be a solace. He thought again of those idle words--hitherto quite\nforgotten--about the first kiss of a girl, and the theory seemed more\nthan reasonable. Of course their sting now lay in their bearing on\nElfride.\n\nElfride, under Knight’s kiss, had certainly been a very different woman\nfrom herself under Stephen’s. Whether for good or for ill, she had\nmarvellously well learnt a betrothed lady’s part; and the fascinating\nfinish of her deportment in this second campaign did probably arise from\nher unreserved encouragement of Stephen. Knight, with all the rapidity\nof jealous sensitiveness, pounced upon some words she had inadvertently\nlet fall about an earring, which he had only partially understood at the\ntime. It was during that ‘initial kiss’ by the little waterfall:\n\n‘We must be careful. I lost the other by doing this!’\n\nA flush which had in it as much of wounded pride as of sorrow, passed\nover Knight as he thought of what he had so frequently said to her\nin his simplicity. ‘I always meant to be the first comer in a woman’s\nheart, fresh lips or none for me.’ How childishly blind he must have\nseemed to this mere girl! How she must have laughed at him inwardly! He\nabsolutely writhed as he thought of the confession she had wrung from\nhim on the boat in the darkness of night. The one conception which had\nsustained his dignity when drawn out of his shell on that occasion--that\nof her charming ignorance of all such matters--how absurd it was!\n\nThis man, whose imagination had been fed up to preternatural size by\nlonely study and silent observations of his kind--whose emotions had\nbeen drawn out long and delicate by his seclusion, like plants in a\ncellar--was now absolutely in pain. Moreover, several years of poetic\nstudy, and, if the truth must be told, poetic efforts, had tended\nto develop the affective side of his constitution still further, in\nproportion to his active faculties. It was his belief in the absolute\nnewness of blandishment to Elfride which had constituted her primary\ncharm. He began to think it was as hard to be earliest in a woman’s\nheart as it was to be first in the Pool of Bethesda.\n\nThat Knight should have been thus constituted: that Elfride’s second\nlover should not have been one of the great mass of bustling mankind,\nlittle given to introspection, whose good-nature might have compensated\nfor any lack of appreciativeness, was the chance of things. That her\nthrobbing, self-confounding, indiscreet heart should have to defend\nitself unaided against the keen scrutiny and logical power which Knight,\nnow that his suspicions were awakened, would sooner or later be sure to\nexercise against her, was her misfortune. A miserable incongruity was\napparent in the circumstance of a strong mind practising its unerring\narchery upon a heart which the owner of that mind loved better than his\nown.\n\nElfride’s docile devotion to Knight was now its own enemy. Clinging\nto him so dependently, she taught him in time to presume upon that\ndevotion--a lesson men are not slow to learn. A slight rebelliousness\noccasionally would have done him no harm, and would have been a world\nof advantage to her. But she idolized him, and was proud to be his\nbond-servant.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXI\n\n     ‘A worm i’ the bud.’\n\n\nOne day the reviewer said, ‘Let us go to the cliffs again, Elfride;’\nand, without consulting her wishes, he moved as if to start at once.\n\n‘The cliff of our dreadful adventure?’ she inquired, with a shudder.\n‘Death stares me in the face in the person of that cliff.’\n\nNevertheless, so entirely had she sunk her individuality in his that the\nremark was not uttered as an expostulation, and she immediately prepared\nto accompany him.\n\n‘No, not that place,’ said Knight. ‘It is ghastly to me, too. That\nother, I mean; what is its name?--Windy Beak.’\n\nWindy Beak was the second cliff in height along that coast, and, as is\nfrequently the case with the natural features of the globe no less than\nwith the intellectual features of men, it enjoyed the reputation of\nbeing the first. Moreover, it was the cliff to which Elfride had ridden\nwith Stephen Smith, on a well-remembered morning of his summer visit.\n\nSo, though thought of the former cliff had caused her to shudder at the\nperils to which her lover and herself had there been exposed, by being\nassociated with Knight only it was not so objectionable as Windy Beak.\nThat place was worse than gloomy, it was a perpetual reproach to her.\n\nBut not liking to refuse, she said, ‘It is further than the other\ncliff.’\n\n‘Yes; but you can ride.’\n\n‘And will you too?’\n\n‘No, I’ll walk.’\n\nA duplicate of her original arrangement with Stephen. Some fatality must\nbe hanging over her head. But she ceased objecting.\n\n‘Very well, Harry, I’ll ride,’ she said meekly.\n\nA quarter of an hour later she was in the saddle. But how different\nthe mood from that of the former time. She had, indeed, given up her\nposition as queen of the less to be vassal of the greater. Here was no\nshowing off now; no scampering out of sight with Pansy, to perplex\nand tire her companion; no saucy remarks on LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI.\nElfride was burdened with the very intensity of her love.\n\nKnight did most of the talking along the journey. Elfride silently\nlistened, and entirely resigned herself to the motions of the ambling\nhorse upon which she sat, alternately rising and sinking gently, like a\nsea bird upon a sea wave.\n\nWhen they had reached the limit of a quadruped’s possibilities in\nwalking, Knight tenderly lifted her from the saddle, tied the horse, and\nrambled on with her to the seat in the rock. Knight sat down, and drew\nElfride deftly beside him, and they looked over the sea.\n\nTwo or three degrees above that melancholy and eternally level line, the\nocean horizon, hung a sun of brass, with no visible rays, in a sky of\nashen hue. It was a sky the sun did not illuminate or enkindle, as is\nusual at sunsets. This sheet of sky was met by the salt mass of\ngray water, flecked here and there with white. A waft of dampness\noccasionally rose to their faces, which was probably rarefied spray from\nthe blows of the sea upon the foot of the cliff.\n\nElfride wished it could be a longer time ago that she had sat there\nwith Stephen as her lover, and agreed to be his wife. The significant\ncloseness of that time to the present was another item to add to the\nlist of passionate fears which were chronic with her now.\n\nYet Knight was very tender this evening, and sustained her close to him\nas they sat.\n\nNot a word had been uttered by either since sitting down, when Knight\nsaid musingly, looking still afar--\n\n‘I wonder if any lovers in past years ever sat here with arms locked, as\nwe do now. Probably they have, for the place seems formed for a seat.’\n\nHer recollection of a well-known pair who had, and the much-talked-of\nloss which had ensued therefrom, and how the young man had been sent\nback to look for the missing article, led Elfride to glance down to her\nside, and behind her back. Many people who lose a trinket involuntarily\ngive a momentary look for it in passing the spot ever so long\nafterwards. They do not often find it. Elfride, in turning her head, saw\nsomething shine weakly from a crevice in the rocky sedile. Only for a\nfew minutes during the day did the sun light the alcove to its innermost\nrifts and slits, but these were the minutes now, and its level rays did\nElfride the good or evil turn of revealing the lost ornament.\n\nElfride’s thoughts instantly reverted to the words she had\nunintentionally uttered upon what had been going on when the earring was\nlost. And she was immediately seized with a misgiving that Knight, on\nseeing the object, would be reminded of her words. Her instinctive act\ntherefore was to secure it privately.\n\nIt was so deep in the crack that Elfride could not pull it out with her\nhand, though she made several surreptitious trials.\n\n‘What are you doing, Elfie?’ said Knight, noticing her attempts, and\nlooking behind him likewise.\n\nShe had relinquished the endeavour, but too late.\n\nKnight peered into the joint from which her hand had been withdrawn, and\nsaw what she had seen. He instantly took a penknife from his pocket,\nand by dint of probing and scraping brought the earring out upon open\nground.\n\n‘It is not yours, surely?’ he inquired.\n\n‘Yes, it is,’ she said quietly.\n\n‘Well, that is a most extraordinary thing, that we should find it like\nthis!’ Knight then remembered more circumstances; ‘What, is it the one\nyou have told me of?’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\nThe unfortunate remark of hers at the kiss came into his mind, if eyes\nwere ever an index to be trusted. Trying to repress the words he yet\nspoke on the subject, more to obtain assurance that what it had seemed\nto imply was not true than from a wish to pry into bygones.\n\n‘Were you really engaged to be married to that lover?’ he said, looking\nstraight forward at the sea again.\n\n‘Yes--but not exactly. Yet I think I was.’\n\n‘O Elfride, engaged to be married!’ he murmured.\n\n‘It would have been called a--secret engagement, I suppose. But don’t\nlook so disappointed; don’t blame me.’\n\n‘No, no.’\n\n‘Why do you say “No, no,” in such a way? Sweetly enough, but so barely?’\n\nKnight made no direct reply to this. ‘Elfride, I told you once,’ he\nsaid, following out his thoughts, ‘that I never kissed a woman as a\nsweetheart until I kissed you. A kiss is not much, I suppose, and it\nhappens to few young people to be able to avoid all blandishments\nand attentions except from the one they afterwards marry. But I have\npeculiar weaknesses, Elfride; and because I have led a peculiar life, I\nmust suffer for it, I suppose. I had hoped--well, what I had no right to\nhope in connection with you. You naturally granted your former lover the\nprivileges you grant me.’\n\nA ‘yes’ came from her like the last sad whisper of a breeze.\n\n‘And he used to kiss you--of course he did.’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘And perhaps you allowed him a more free manner in his love-making than\nI have shown in mine.’\n\n‘No, I did not.’ This was rather more alertly spoken.\n\n‘But he adopted it without being allowed?’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘How much I have made of you, Elfride, and how I have kept aloof!’ said\nKnight in deep and shaken tones. ‘So many days and hours as I have hoped\nin you--I have feared to kiss you more than those two times. And he made\nno scruples to...’\n\nShe crept closer to him and trembled as if with cold. Her dread that the\nwhole story, with random additions, would become known to him, caused\nher manner to be so agitated that Knight was alarmed and perplexed into\nstillness. The actual innocence which made her think so fearfully of\nwhat, as the world goes, was not a great matter, magnified her apparent\nguilt. It may have said to Knight that a woman who was so flurried in\nthe preliminaries must have a dreadful sequel to her tale.\n\n‘I know,’ continued Knight, with an indescribable drag of manner and\nintonation,--‘I know I am absurdly scrupulous about you--that I want you\ntoo exclusively mine. In your past before you knew me--from your very\ncradle--I wanted to think you had been mine. I would make you mine by\nmain force. Elfride,’ he went on vehemently, ‘I can’t help this jealousy\nover you! It is my nature, and must be so, and I HATE the fact that you\nhave been caressed before: yes hate it!’\n\nShe drew a long deep breath, which was half a sob. Knight’s face was\nhard, and he never looked at her at all, still fixing his gaze far out\nto sea, which the sun had now resigned to the shade. In high places it\nis not long from sunset to night, dusk being in a measure banished, and\nthough only evening where they sat, it had been twilight in the\nvalleys for half an hour. Upon the dull expanse of sea there gradually\nintensified itself into existence the gleam of a distant light-ship.\n\n‘When that lover first kissed you, Elfride was it in such a place as\nthis?’\n\n‘Yes, it was.’\n\n‘You don’t tell me anything but what I wring out of you. Why is that?\nWhy have you suppressed all mention of this when casual confidences of\nmine should have suggested confidence in return? On board the Juliet,\nwhy were you so secret? It seems like being made a fool of, Elfride, to\nthink that, when I was teaching you how desirable it was that we should\nhave no secrets from each other, you were assenting in words, but in act\ncontradicting me. Confidence would have been so much more promising for\nour happiness. If you had had confidence in me, and told me willingly, I\nshould--be different. But you suppress everything, and I shall question\nyou. Did you live at Endelstow at that time?’\n\n‘Yes,’ she said faintly.\n\n‘Where were you when he first kissed you?’\n\n‘Sitting in this seat.’\n\n‘Ah, I thought so!’ said Knight, rising and facing her.\n\n‘And that accounts for everything--the exclamation which you explained\ndeceitfully, and all! Forgive the harsh word, Elfride--forgive it.’ He\nsmiled a surface smile as he continued: ‘What a poor mortal I am to play\nsecond fiddle in everything and to be deluded by fibs!’\n\n‘Oh, don’t say it; don’t, Harry!’\n\n‘Where did he kiss you besides here?’\n\n‘Sitting on--a tomb in the--churchyard--and other places,’ she answered\nwith slow recklessness.\n\n‘Never mind, never mind,’ he exclaimed, on seeing her tears and\nperturbation. ‘I don’t want to grieve you. I don’t care.’\n\nBut Knight did care.\n\n‘It makes no difference, you know,’ he continued, seeing she did not\nreply.\n\n‘I feel cold,’ said Elfride. ‘Shall we go home?’\n\n‘Yes; it is late in the year to sit long out of doors: we ought to be\noff this ledge before it gets too dark to let us see our footing. I\ndaresay the horse is impatient.’\n\nKnight spoke the merest commonplace to her now. He had hoped to the\nlast moment that she would have volunteered the whole story of her first\nattachment. It grew more and more distasteful to him that she should\nhave a secret of this nature. Such entire confidence as he had pictured\nas about to exist between himself and the innocent young wife who had\nknown no lover’s tones save his--was this its beginning? He lifted\nher upon the horse, and they went along constrainedly. The poison of\nsuspicion was doing its work well.\n\nAn incident occurred on this homeward journey which was long remembered\nby both, as adding shade to shadow. Knight could not keep from his\nmind the words of Adam’s reproach to Eve in PARADISE LOST, and at last\nwhispered them to himself--\n\n\n    ‘Fool’d and beguiled: by him thou, I by thee!’\n\n\n‘What did you say?’ Elfride inquired timorously.\n\n‘It was only a quotation.’\n\nThey had now dropped into a hollow, and the church tower made its\nappearance against the pale evening sky, its lower part being hidden by\nsome intervening trees. Elfride, being denied an answer, was looking at\nthe tower and trying to think of some contrasting quotation she might\nuse to regain his tenderness. After a little thought she said in winning\ntones--\n\n“Thou hast been my hope, and a strong tower for me against the enemy.”’\n\nThey passed on. A few minutes later three or four birds were seen to fly\nout of the tower.\n\n‘The strong tower moves,’ said Knight, with surprise.\n\nA corner of the square mass swayed forward, sank, and vanished. A loud\nrumble followed, and a cloud of dust arose where all had previously been\nso clear.\n\n‘The church restorers have done it!’ said Elfride.\n\nAt this minute Mr. Swancourt was seen approaching them. He came up with\na bustling demeanour, apparently much engrossed by some business in\nhand.\n\n‘We have got the tower down!’ he exclaimed. ‘It came rather quicker\nthan we intended it should. The first idea was to take it down stone by\nstone, you know. In doing this the crack widened considerably, and it\nwas not believed safe for the men to stand upon the walls any longer.\nThen we decided to undermine it, and three men set to work at the\nweakest corner this afternoon. They had left off for the evening,\nintending to give the final blow to-morrow morning, and had been home\nabout half an hour, when down it came. A very successful job--a very\nfine job indeed. But he was a tough old fellow in spite of the crack.’\nHere Mr. Swancourt wiped from his face the perspiration his excitement\nhad caused him.\n\n‘Poor old tower!’ said Elfride.\n\n‘Yes, I am sorry for it,’ said Knight. ‘It was an interesting piece of\nantiquity--a local record of local art.’\n\n‘Ah, but my dear sir, we shall have a new one, expostulated Mr.\nSwancourt; ‘a splendid tower--designed by a first-rate London man--in\nthe newest style of Gothic art, and full of Christian feeling.’\n\n‘Indeed!’ said Knight.\n\n‘Oh yes. Not in the barbarous clumsy architecture of this neighbourhood;\nyou see nothing so rough and pagan anywhere else in England. When\nthe men are gone, I would advise you to go and see the church before\nanything further is done to it. You can now sit in the chancel, and look\ndown the nave through the west arch, and through that far out to sea. In\nfact,’ said Mr. Swancourt significantly, ‘if a wedding were performed\nat the altar to-morrow morning, it might be witnessed from the deck of\na ship on a voyage to the South Seas, with a good glass. However, after\ndinner, when the moon has risen, go up and see for yourselves.’\n\nKnight assented with feverish readiness. He had decided within the last\nfew minutes that he could not rest another night without further talk\nwith Elfride upon the subject which now divided them: he was determined\nto know all, and relieve his disquiet in some way. Elfride would gladly\nhave escaped further converse alone with him that night, but it seemed\ninevitable.\n\nJust after moonrise they left the house. How little any expectation\nof the moonlight prospect--which was the ostensible reason of their\npilgrimage--had to do with Knight’s real motive in getting the gentle\ngirl again upon his arm, Elfride no less than himself well knew.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXII\n\n    ‘Had I wist before I kist’\n\n\nIt was now October, and the night air was chill. After looking to see\nthat she was well wrapped up, Knight took her along the hillside path\nthey had ascended so many times in each other’s company, when doubt was\na thing unknown. On reaching the church they found that one side of the\ntower was, as the vicar had stated, entirely removed, and lying in the\nshape of rubbish at their feet. The tower on its eastern side still\nwas firm, and might have withstood the shock of storms and the siege\nof battering years for many a generation even now. They entered by the\nside-door, went eastward, and sat down by the altar-steps.\n\nThe heavy arch spanning the junction of tower and nave formed to-night\na black frame to a distant misty view, stretching far westward. Just\noutside the arch came the heap of fallen stones, then a portion of\nmoonlit churchyard, then the wide and convex sea behind. It was a\ncoup-d’oeil which had never been possible since the mediaeval masons\nfirst attached the old tower to the older church it dignified, and\nhence must be supposed to have had an interest apart from that of simple\nmoonlight on ancient wall and sea and shore--any mention of which has by\nthis time, it is to be feared, become one of the cuckoo-cries which are\nheard but not regarded. Rays of crimson, blue, and purple shone upon the\ntwain from the east window behind them, wherein saints and angels vied\nwith each other in primitive surroundings of landscape and sky, and\nthrew upon the pavement at the sitters’ feet a softer reproduction of\nthe same translucent hues, amid which the shadows of the two living\nheads of Knight and Elfride were opaque and prominent blots. Presently\nthe moon became covered by a cloud, and the iridescence died away.\n\n‘There, it is gone!’ said Knight. ‘I’ve been thinking, Elfride, that\nthis place we sit on is where we may hope to kneel together soon. But I\nam restless and uneasy, and you know why.’\n\nBefore she replied the moonlight returned again, irradiating that\nportion of churchyard within their view. It brightened the near part\nfirst, and against the background which the cloud-shadow had not yet\nuncovered stood, brightest of all, a white tomb--the tomb of young\nJethway.\n\nKnight, still alive on the subject of Elfride’s secret, thought of her\nwords concerning the kiss that it once had occurred on a tomb in this\nchurchyard.\n\n‘Elfride,’ he said, with a superficial archness which did not half cover\nan undercurrent of reproach, ‘do you know, I think you might have told\nme voluntarily about that past--of kisses and betrothing--without giving\nme so much uneasiness and trouble. Was that the tomb you alluded to as\nhaving sat on with him?’\n\nShe waited an instant. ‘Yes,’ she said.\n\nThe correctness of his random shot startled Knight; though, considering\nthat almost all the other memorials in the churchyard were upright\nheadstones upon which nobody could possibly sit, it was not so\nwonderful.\n\nElfride did not even now go on with the explanation her exacting lover\nwished to have, and her reticence began to irritate him as before. He\nwas inclined to read her a lecture.\n\n‘Why don’t you tell me all?’ he said somewhat indignantly. ‘Elfride,\nthere is not a single subject upon which I feel more strongly than upon\nthis--that everything ought to be cleared up between two persons before\nthey become husband and wife. See how desirable and wise such a\ncourse is, in order to avoid disagreeable contingencies in the form of\ndiscoveries afterwards. For, Elfride, a secret of no importance at all\nmay be made the basis of some fatal misunderstanding only because it is\ndiscovered, and not confessed. They say there never was a couple of whom\none had not some secret the other never knew or was intended to know.\nThis may or may not be true; but if it be true, some have been happy in\nspite rather than in consequence of it. If a man were to see another\nman looking significantly at his wife, and she were blushing crimson and\nappearing startled, do you think he would be so well satisfied with, for\ninstance, her truthful explanation that once, to her great annoyance,\nshe accidentally fainted into his arms, as if she had said it\nvoluntarily long ago, before the circumstance occurred which forced it\nfrom her? Suppose that admirer you spoke of in connection with the tomb\nyonder should turn up, and bother me. It would embitter our lives, if I\nwere then half in the dark, as I am now!’\n\nKnight spoke the latter sentences with growing force.\n\n‘It cannot be,’ she said.\n\n‘Why not?’ he asked sharply.\n\nElfride was distressed to find him in so stern a mood, and she trembled.\nIn a confusion of ideas, probably not intending a wilful prevarication,\nshe answered hurriedly--\n\n‘If he’s dead, how can you meet him?’\n\n‘Is he dead? Oh, that’s different altogether!’ said Knight, immensely\nrelieved. ‘But, let me see--what did you say about that tomb and him?’\n\n‘That’s his tomb,’ she continued faintly.\n\n‘What! was he who lies buried there the man who was your lover?’ Knight\nasked in a distinct voice.\n\n‘Yes; and I didn’t love him or encourage him.’\n\n‘But you let him kiss you--you said so, you know, Elfride.’\n\nShe made no reply.\n\n‘Why,’ said Knight, recollecting circumstances by degrees, ‘you surely\nsaid you were in some degree engaged to him--and of course you were if\nhe kissed you. And now you say you never encouraged him. And I have been\nfancying you said--I am almost sure you did--that you were sitting with\nhim ON that tomb. Good God!’ he cried, suddenly starting up in anger,\n‘are you telling me untruths? Why should you play with me like this?\nI’ll have the right of it. Elfride, we shall never be happy! There’s\na blight upon us, or me, or you, and it must be cleared off before we\nmarry.’ Knight moved away impetuously as if to leave her.\n\nShe jumped up and clutched his arm\n\n‘Don’t go, Harry--don’t!\n\n‘Tell me, then,’ said Knight sternly. ‘And remember this, no more fibs,\nor, upon my soul, I shall hate you. Heavens! that I should come to this,\nto be made a fool of by a girl’s untruths----’\n\n‘Don’t, don’t treat me so cruelly! O Harry, Harry, have pity, and\nwithdraw those dreadful words! I am truthful by nature--I am--and I\ndon’t know how I came to make you misunderstand! But I was frightened!’\nShe quivered so in her perturbation that she shook him with her {Note:\nsentence incomplete in text.}\n\n‘Did you say you were sitting on that tomb?’ he asked moodily.\n\n‘Yes; and it was true.’\n\n‘Then how, in the name of Heaven, can a man sit upon his own tomb?’\n\n‘That was another man. Forgive me, Harry, won’t you?’\n\n‘What, a lover in the tomb and a lover on it?’\n\n‘Oh--Oh--yes!’\n\n‘Then there were two before me?\n\n‘I--suppose so.’\n\n‘Now, don’t be a silly woman with your supposing--I hate all that,’ said\nKnight contemptuously almost. ‘Well, we learn strange things. I\ndon’t know what I might have done--no man can say into what shape\ncircumstances may warp him--but I hardly think I should have had the\nconscience to accept the favours of a new lover whilst sitting over the\npoor remains of the old one; upon my soul, I don’t.’ Knight, in moody\nmeditation, continued looking towards the tomb, which stood staring them\nin the face like an avenging ghost.\n\n‘But you wrong me--Oh, so grievously!’ she cried. ‘I did not meditate\nany such thing: believe me, Harry, I did not. It only happened so--quite\nof itself.’\n\n‘Well, I suppose you didn’t INTEND such a thing,’ he said. ‘Nobody ever\ndoes,’ he sadly continued.\n\n‘And him in the grave I never once loved.’\n\n‘I suppose the second lover and you, as you sat there, vowed to be\nfaithful to each other for ever?’\n\nElfride only replied by quick heavy breaths, showing she was on the\nbrink of a sob.\n\n‘You don’t choose to be anything but reserved, then?’ he said\nimperatively.\n\n‘Of course we did,’ she responded.\n\n‘“Of course!” You seem to treat the subject very lightly?’\n\n‘It is past, and is nothing to us now.’\n\n‘Elfride, it is a nothing which, though it may make a careless man\nlaugh, cannot but make a genuine one grieve. It is a very gnawing pain.\nTell me straight through--all of it.’\n\n‘Never. O Harry! how can you expect it when so little of it makes you so\nharsh with me?’\n\n‘Now, Elfride, listen to this. You know that what you have told only\njars the subtler fancies in one, after all. The feeling I have about it\nwould be called, and is, mere sentimentality; and I don’t want you to\nsuppose that an ordinary previous engagement of a straightforward kind\nwould make any practical difference in my love, or my wish to make you\nmy wife. But you seem to have more to tell, and that’s where the wrong\nis. Is there more?’\n\n‘Not much more,’ she wearily answered.\n\nKnight preserved a grave silence for a minute. ‘“Not much more,”’ he\nsaid at last. ‘I should think not, indeed!’ His voice assumed a low and\nsteady pitch. ‘Elfride, you must not mind my saying a strange-sounding\nthing, for say it I shall. It is this: that if there WERE much more\nto add to an account which already includes all the particulars that\na broken marriage engagement could possibly include with propriety, it\nmust be some exceptional thing which might make it impossible for me or\nany one else to love you and marry you.’\n\nKnight’s disturbed mood led him much further than he would have gone\nin a quieter moment. And, even as it was, had she been assertive to any\ndegree he would not have been so peremptory; and had she been a stronger\ncharacter--more practical and less imaginative--she would have made more\nuse of her position in his heart to influence him. But the confiding\ntenderness which had won him is ever accompanied by a sort of\nself-committal to the stream of events, leading every such woman to\ntrust more to the kindness of fate for good results than to any argument\nof her own.\n\n‘Well, well,’ he murmured cynically; ‘I won’t say it is your fault:\nit is my ill-luck, I suppose. I had no real right to question\nyou--everybody would say it was presuming. But when we have\nmisunderstood, we feel injured by the subject of our misunderstanding.\nYou never said you had had nobody else here making love to you, so why\nshould I blame you? Elfride, I beg your pardon.’\n\n‘No, no! I would rather have your anger than that cool aggrieved\npoliteness. Do drop that, Harry! Why should you inflict that upon me? It\nreduces me to the level of a mere acquaintance.’\n\n‘You do that with me. Why not confidence for confidence?’\n\n‘Yes; but I didn’t ask you a single question with regard to your past:\nI didn’t wish to know about it. All I cared for was that, wherever you\ncame from, whatever you had done, whoever you had loved, you were mine\nat last. Harry, if originally you had known I had loved, would you never\nhave cared for me?’\n\n‘I won’t quite say that. Though I own that the idea of your\ninexperienced state had a great charm for me. But I think this: that if\nI had known there was any phase of your past love you would refuse to\nreveal if I asked to know it, I should never have loved you.’\n\nElfride sobbed bitterly. ‘Am I such a--mere characterless toy--as to\nhave no attrac--tion in me, apart from--freshness? Haven’t I brains?\nYou said--I was clever and ingenious in my thoughts, and--isn’t that\nanything? Have I not some beauty? I think I have a little--and I know\nI have--yes, I do! You have praised my voice, and my manner, and my\naccomplishments. Yet all these together are so much rubbish because\nI--accidentally saw a man before you!’\n\n‘Oh, come, Elfride. “Accidentally saw a man” is very cool. You loved\nhim, remember.’\n\n--‘And loved him a little!’\n\n‘And refuse now to answer the simple question how it ended. Do you\nrefuse still, Elfride?’\n\n‘You have no right to question me so--you said so. It is unfair. Trust\nme as I trust you.’\n\n‘That’s not at all.’\n\n‘I shall not love you if you are so cruel. It is cruel to me to argue\nlike this.’\n\n‘Perhaps it is. Yes, it is. I was carried away by my feeling for you.\nHeaven knows that I didn’t mean to; but I have loved you so that I have\nused you badly.’\n\n‘I don’t mind it, Harry!’ she instantly answered, creeping up and\nnestling against him; ‘and I will not think at all that you used me\nharshly if you will forgive me, and not be vexed with me any more? I do\nwish I had been exactly as you thought I was, but I could not help it,\nyou know. If I had only known you had been coming, what a nunnery I\nwould have lived in to have been good enough for you!’\n\n‘Well, never mind,’ said Knight; and he turned to go. He endeavoured\nto speak sportively as they went on. ‘Diogenes Laertius says that\nphilosophers used voluntarily to deprive themselves of sight to be\nuninterrupted in their meditations. Men, becoming lovers, ought to do\nthe same thing.’\n\n‘Why?--but never mind--I don’t want to know. Don’t speak laconically to\nme,’ she said with deprecation.\n\n‘Why? Because they would never then be distracted by discovering their\nidol was second-hand.’\n\nShe looked down and sighed; and they passed out of the crumbling old\nplace, and slowly crossed to the churchyard entrance. Knight was not\nhimself, and he could not pretend to be. She had not told all.\n\nHe supported her lightly over the stile, and was practically as\nattentive as a lover could be. But there had passed away a glory, and\nthe dream was not as it had been of yore. Perhaps Knight was not shaped\nby Nature for a marrying man. Perhaps his lifelong constraint towards\nwomen, which he had attributed to accident, was not chance after\nall, but the natural result of instinctive acts so minute as to be\nundiscernible even by himself. Or whether the rough dispelling of\nany bright illusion, however imaginative, depreciates the real and\nunexaggerated brightness which appertains to its basis, one cannot say.\nCertain it was that Knight’s disappointment at finding himself second\nor third in the field, at Elfride’s momentary equivoque, and at her\nreluctance to be candid, brought him to the verge of cynicism.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIII\n\n     ‘O daughter of Babylon, wasted with misery.’\n\n\nA habit of Knight’s, when not immediately occupied with Elfride--to walk\nby himself for half an hour or so between dinner and bedtime--had become\nfamiliar to his friends at Endelstow, Elfride herself among them. When\nhe had helped her over the stile, she said gently, ‘If you wish to take\nyour usual turn on the hill, Harry, I can run down to the house alone.’\n\n‘Thank you, Elfie; then I think I will.’\n\nHer form diminished to blackness in the moonlight, and Knight, after\nremaining upon the churchyard stile a few minutes longer, turned back\nagain towards the building. His usual course was now to light a cigar or\npipe, and indulge in a quiet meditation. But to-night his mind was too\ntense to bethink itself of such a solace. He merely walked round to the\nsite of the fallen tower, and sat himself down upon some of the\nlarge stones which had composed it until this day, when the chain of\ncircumstance originated by Stephen Smith, while in the employ of Mr.\nHewby, the London man of art, had brought about its overthrow.\n\nPondering on the possible episodes of Elfride’s past life, and on how\nhe had supposed her to have had no past justifying the name, he sat and\nregarded the white tomb of young Jethway, now close in front of him.\nThe sea, though comparatively placid, could as usual be heard from this\npoint along the whole distance between promontories to the right and\nleft, floundering and entangling itself among the insulated stacks of\nrock which dotted the water’s edge--the miserable skeletons of tortured\nold cliffs that would not even yet succumb to the wear and tear of the\ntides.\n\nAs a change from thoughts not of a very cheerful kind, Knight attempted\nexertion. He stood up, and prepared to ascend to the summit of\nthe ruinous heap of stones, from which a more extended outlook was\nobtainable than from the ground. He stretched out his arm to seize the\nprojecting arris of a larger block than ordinary, and so help himself\nup, when his hand lighted plump upon a substance differing in the\ngreatest possible degree from what he had expected to seize--hard stone.\nIt was stringy and entangled, and trailed upon the stone. The\ndeep shadow from the aisle wall prevented his seeing anything here\ndistinctly, and he began guessing as a necessity. ‘It is a tressy\nspecies of moss or lichen,’ he said to himself.\n\nBut it lay loosely over the stone.\n\n‘It is a tuft of grass,’ he said.\n\nBut it lacked the roughness and humidity of the finest grass.\n\n‘It is a mason’s whitewash-brush.’\n\nSuch brushes, he remembered, were more bristly; and however much used in\nrepairing a structure, would not be required in pulling one down.\n\nHe said, ‘It must be a thready silk fringe.’\n\nHe felt further in. It was somewhat warm. Knight instantly felt somewhat\ncold.\n\nTo find the coldness of inanimate matter where you expect warmth is\nstartling enough; but a colder temperature than that of the body being\nrather the rule than the exception in common substances, it hardly\nconveys such a shock to the system as finding warmth where utter\nfrigidity is anticipated.\n\n‘God only knows what it is,’ he said.\n\nHe felt further, and in the course of a minute put his hand upon a human\nhead. The head was warm, but motionless. The thready mass was the hair\nof the head--long and straggling, showing that the head was a woman’s.\n\nKnight in his perplexity stood still for a moment, and collected his\nthoughts. The vicar’s account of the fall of the tower was that the\nworkmen had been undermining it all the day, and had left in the evening\nintending to give the finishing stroke the next morning. Half an hour\nafter they had gone the undermined angle came down. The woman who was\nhalf buried, as it seemed, must have been beneath it at the moment of\nthe fall.\n\nKnight leapt up and began endeavouring to remove the rubbish with his\nhands. The heap overlying the body was for the most part fine and\ndusty, but in immense quantity. It would be a saving of time to run for\nassistance. He crossed to the churchyard wall, and hastened down the\nhill.\n\nA little way down an intersecting road passed over a small ridge, which\nnow showed up darkly against the moon, and this road here formed a\nkind of notch in the sky-line. At the moment that Knight arrived at the\ncrossing he beheld a man on this eminence, coming towards him. Knight\nturned aside and met the stranger.\n\n‘There has been an accident at the church,’ said Knight, without\npreface. ‘The tower has fallen on somebody, who has been lying there\never since. Will you come and help?’\n\n‘That I will,’ said the man.\n\n‘It is a woman,’ said Knight, as they hurried back, ‘and I think we two\nare enough to extricate her. Do you know of a shovel?’\n\n‘The grave-digging shovels are about somewhere. They used to stay in the\ntower.’\n\n‘And there must be some belonging to the workmen.’\n\nThey searched about, and in an angle of the porch found three carefully\nstowed away. Going round to the west end Knight signified the spot of\nthe tragedy.\n\n‘We ought to have brought a lantern,’ he exclaimed. ‘But we may be able\nto do without.’ He set to work removing the superincumbent mass.\n\nThe other man, who looked on somewhat helplessly at first, now followed\nthe example of Knight’s activity, and removed the larger stones which\nwere mingled with the rubbish. But with all their efforts it was\nquite ten minutes before the body of the unfortunate creature could be\nextricated. They lifted her as carefully as they could, breathlessly\ncarried her to Felix Jethway’s tomb, which was only a few steps\nwestward, and laid her thereon.\n\n‘Is she dead indeed?’ said the stranger.\n\n‘She appears to be,’ said Knight. ‘Which is the nearest house? The\nvicarage, I suppose.’\n\n‘Yes; but since we shall have to call a surgeon from Castle Boterel, I\nthink it would be better to carry her in that direction, instead of away\nfrom the town.’\n\n‘And is it not much further to the first house we come to going that\nway, than to the vicarage or to The Crags?’\n\n‘Not much,’ the stranger replied.\n\n‘Suppose we take her there, then. And I think the best way to do it\nwould be thus, if you don’t mind joining hands with me.’\n\n‘Not in the least; I am glad to assist.’\n\nMaking a kind of cradle, by clasping their hands crosswise under the\ninanimate woman, they lifted her, and walked on side by side down a path\nindicated by the stranger, who appeared to know the locality well.\n\n‘I had been sitting in the church for nearly an hour,’ Knight resumed,\nwhen they were out of the churchyard. ‘Afterwards I walked round to the\nsite of the fallen tower, and so found her. It is painful to think I\nunconsciously wasted so much time in the very presence of a perishing,\nflying soul.’\n\n‘The tower fell at dusk, did it not? quite two hours ago, I think?’\n\n‘Yes. She must have been there alone. What could have been her object in\nvisiting the churchyard then?\n\n‘It is difficult to say.’ The stranger looked inquiringly into the\nreclining face of the motionless form they bore. ‘Would you turn her\nround for a moment, so that the light shines on her face?’ he said.\n\nThey turned her face to the moon, and the man looked closer into her\nfeatures. ‘Why, I know her!’ he exclaimed.\n\n‘Who is she?’\n\n‘Mrs. Jethway. And the cottage we are taking her to is her own. She is\na widow; and I was speaking to her only this afternoon. I was at Castle\nBoterel post-office, and she came there to post a letter. Poor soul! Let\nus hurry on.’\n\n‘Hold my wrist a little tighter. Was not that tomb we laid her on the\ntomb of her only son?’\n\n‘Yes, it was. Yes, I see it now. She was there to visit the tomb. Since\nthe death of that son she has been a desolate, desponding woman, always\nbewailing him. She was a farmer’s wife, very well educated--a governess\noriginally, I believe.’\n\nKnight’s heart was moved to sympathy. His own fortunes seemed in some\nstrange way to be interwoven with those of this Jethway family, through\nthe influence of Elfride over himself and the unfortunate son of that\nhouse. He made no reply, and they still walked on.\n\n‘She begins to feel heavy,’ said the stranger, breaking the silence.\n\n‘Yes, she does,’ said Knight; and after another pause added, ‘I think I\nhave met you before, though where I cannot recollect. May I ask who you\nare?’\n\n‘Oh yes. I am Lord Luxellian. Who are you?’\n\n‘I am a visitor at The Crags--Mr. Knight.’\n\n‘I have heard of you, Mr. Knight.’\n\n‘And I of you, Lord Luxellian. I am glad to meet you.’\n\n‘I may say the same. I am familiar with your name in print.’\n\n‘And I with yours. Is this the house?’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\nThe door was locked. Knight, reflecting a moment, searched the pocket\nof the lifeless woman, and found therein a large key which, on being\napplied to the door, opened it easily. The fire was out, but the\nmoonlight entered the quarried window, and made patterns upon the floor.\nThe rays enabled them to see that the room into which they had entered\nwas pretty well furnished, it being the same room that Elfride had\nvisited alone two or three evenings earlier. They deposited their still\nburden on an old-fashioned couch which stood against the wall, and\nKnight searched about for a lamp or candle. He found a candle on a\nshelf, lighted it, and placed it on the table.\n\nBoth Knight and Lord Luxellian examined the pale countenance\nattentively, and both were nearly convinced that there was no hope. No\nmarks of violence were visible in the casual examination they made.\n\n‘I think that as I know where Doctor Granson lives,’ said Lord\nLuxellian, ‘I had better run for him whilst you stay here.’\n\nKnight agreed to this. Lord Luxellian then went off, and his hurrying\nfootsteps died away. Knight continued bending over the body, and a few\nminutes longer of careful scrutiny perfectly satisfied him that\nthe woman was far beyond the reach of the lancet and the drug. Her\nextremities were already beginning to get stiff and cold. Knight covered\nher face, and sat down.\n\nThe minutes went by. The essayist remained musing on all the occurrences\nof the night. His eyes were directed upon the table, and he had seen\nfor some time that writing-materials were spread upon it. He now noticed\nthese more particularly: there were an inkstand, pen, blotting-book,\nand note-paper. Several sheets of paper were thrust aside from the rest,\nupon which letters had been begun and relinquished, as if their form had\nnot been satisfactory to the writer. A stick of black sealing-wax\nand seal were there too, as if the ordinary fastening had not been\nconsidered sufficiently secure. The abandoned sheets of paper lying as\nthey did open upon the table, made it possible, as he sat, to read the\nfew words written on each. One ran thus:\n\n\n‘SIR,--As a woman who was once blest with a dear son of her own, I\nimplore you to accept a warning----’\n\n\nAnother:\n\n\n‘SIR,--If you will deign to receive warning from a stranger before it is\ntoo late to alter your course, listen to----’\n\n\nThe third:\n\n\n‘SIR,--With this letter I enclose to you another which, unaided by any\nexplanation from me, tells a startling tale. I wish, however, to add a\nfew words to make your delusion yet more clear to you----’\n\n\n\nIt was plain that, after these renounced beginnings, a fourth letter had\nbeen written and despatched, which had been deemed a proper one. Upon\nthe table were two drops of sealing-wax, the stick from which they were\ntaken having been laid down overhanging the edge of the table; the end\nof it drooped, showing that the wax was placed there whilst warm.\nThere was the chair in which the writer had sat, the impression of the\nletter’s address upon the blotting-paper, and the poor widow who had\ncaused these results lying dead hard by. Knight had seen enough to\nlead him to the conclusion that Mrs. Jethway, having matter of great\nimportance to communicate to some friend or acquaintance, had written\nhim a very careful letter, and gone herself to post it; that she had not\nreturned to the house from that time of leaving it till Lord Luxellian\nand himself had brought her back dead.\n\nThe unutterable melancholy of the whole scene, as he waited on, silent\nand alone, did not altogether clash with the mood of Knight, even though\nhe was the affianced of a fair and winning girl, and though so lately he\nhad been in her company. Whilst sitting on the remains of the demolished\ntower he had defined a new sensation; that the lengthened course of\ninaction he had lately been indulging in on Elfride’s account might\nprobably not be good for him as a man who had work to do. It could\nquickly be put an end to by hastening on his marriage with her.\n\nKnight, in his own opinion, was one who had missed his mark by excessive\naiming. Having now, to a great extent, given up ideal ambitions, he\nwished earnestly to direct his powers into a more practical channel,\nand thus correct the introspective tendencies which had never brought\nhimself much happiness, or done his fellow-creatures any great good.\nTo make a start in this new direction by marriage, which, since knowing\nElfride, had been so entrancing an idea, was less exquisite to-night.\nThat the curtailment of his illusion regarding her had something to do\nwith the reaction, and with the return of his old sentiments on wasting\ntime, is more than probable. Though Knight’s heart had so greatly\nmastered him, the mastery was not so complete as to be easily maintained\nin the face of a moderate intellectual revival.\n\nHis reverie was broken by the sound of wheels, and a horse’s tramp.\nThe door opened to admit the surgeon, Lord Luxellian, and a Mr. Coole,\ncoroner for the division (who had been attending at Castle Boterel that\nvery day, and was having an after-dinner chat with the doctor when Lord\nLuxellian arrived); next came two female nurses and some idlers.\n\nMr. Granson, after a cursory examination, pronounced the woman dead from\nsuffocation, induced by intense pressure on the respiratory organs;\nand arrangements were made that the inquiry should take place on the\nfollowing morning, before the return of the coroner to St. Launce’s.\n\nShortly afterwards the house of the widow was deserted by all its living\noccupants, and she abode in death, as she had in her life during the\npast two years, entirely alone.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIV\n\n   ‘Yea, happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.’\n\n\nSixteen hours had passed. Knight was entering the ladies’ boudoir at The\nCrags, upon his return from attending the inquest touching the death of\nMrs. Jethway. Elfride was not in the apartment.\n\nMrs. Swancourt made a few inquiries concerning the verdict and\ncollateral circumstances. Then she said--\n\n‘The postman came this morning the minute after you left the house.\nThere was only one letter for you, and I have it here.’\n\nShe took a letter from the lid of her workbox, and handed it to him.\nKnight took the missive abstractedly, but struck by its appearance\nmurmured a few words and left the room.\n\nThe letter was fastened with a black seal, and the handwriting in which\nit was addressed had lain under his eyes, long and prominently, only the\nevening before.\n\nKnight was greatly agitated, and looked about for a spot where he might\nbe secure from interruption. It was the season of heavy dews, which\nlay on the herbage in shady places all the day long; nevertheless, he\nentered a small patch of neglected grass-plat enclosed by the shrubbery,\nand there perused the letter, which he had opened on his way thither.\n\nThe handwriting, the seal, the paper, the introductory words, all had\ntold on the instant that the letter had come to him from the hands of\nthe widow Jethway, now dead and cold. He had instantly understood that\nthe unfinished notes which caught his eye yesternight were intended for\nnobody but himself. He had remembered some of the words of Elfride\nin her sleep on the steamer, that somebody was not to tell him of\nsomething, or it would be her ruin--a circumstance hitherto deemed so\ntrivial and meaningless that he had well-nigh forgotten it. All these\nthings infused into him an emotion intense in power and supremely\ndistressing in quality. The paper in his hand quivered as he read:\n\n\n‘THE VALLEY, ENDELSTOW.\n\n‘SIR,--A woman who has not much in the world to lose by any censure this\nact may bring upon her, wishes to give you some hints concerning a lady\nyou love. If you will deign to accept a warning before it is too late,\nyou will notice what your correspondent has to say.\n\n‘You are deceived. Can such a woman as this be worthy?\n\n‘One who encouraged an honest youth to love her, then slighted him, so\nthat he died.\n\n‘One who next took a man of no birth as a lover, who was forbidden the\nhouse by her father.\n\n‘One who secretly left her home to be married to that man, met him, and\nwent with him to London.\n\n‘One who, for some reason or other, returned again unmarried.\n\n‘One who, in her after-correspondence with him, went so far as to\naddress him as her husband.\n\n‘One who wrote the enclosed letter to ask me, who better than anybody\nelse knows the story, to keep the scandal a secret.\n\n‘I hope soon to be beyond the reach of either blame or praise. But\nbefore removing me God has put it in my power to avenge the death of my\nson.\n\n‘GERTRUDE JETHWAY.’\n\n\nThe letter enclosed was the note in pencil that Elfride had written in\nMrs. Jethway’s cottage:\n\n\n‘DEAR MRS. JETHWAY,--I have been to visit you. I wanted much to see\nyou, but I cannot wait any longer. I came to beg you not to execute the\nthreats you have repeated to me. Do not, I beseech you, Mrs. Jethway,\nlet any one know I ran away from home! It would ruin me with him, and\nbreak my heart. I will do anything for you, if you will be kind to\nme. In the name of our common womanhood, do not, I implore you, make a\nscandal of me.--Yours,\n\n‘E. SWANCOURT.\n\n\nKnight turned his head wearily towards the house. The ground rose\nrapidly on nearing the shrubbery in which he stood, raising it almost to\na level with the first floor of The Crags. Elfride’s dressing-room\nlay in the salient angle in this direction, and it was lighted by two\nwindows in such a position that, from Knight’s standing-place, his sight\npassed through both windows, and raked the room. Elfride was there;\nshe was pausing between the two windows, looking at her figure in\nthe cheval-glass. She regarded herself long and attentively in front;\nturned, flung back her head, and observed the reflection over her\nshoulder.\n\nNobody can predicate as to her object or fancy; she may have done the\ndeed in the very abstraction of deep sadness. She may have been moaning\nfrom the bottom of her heart, ‘How unhappy am I!’ But the impression\nproduced on Knight was not a good one. He dropped his eyes moodily. The\ndead woman’s letter had a virtue in the accident of its juncture far\nbeyond any it intrinsically exhibited. Circumstance lent to evil words a\nring of pitiless justice echoing from the grave. Knight could not endure\ntheir possession. He tore the letter into fragments.\n\nHe heard a brushing among the bushes behind, and turning his head he saw\nElfride following him. The fair girl looked in his face with a wistful\nsmile of hope, too forcedly hopeful to displace the firmly established\ndread beneath it. His severe words of the previous night still sat heavy\nupon her.\n\n‘I saw you from my window, Harry,’ she said timidly.\n\n‘The dew will make your feet wet,’ he observed, as one deaf.\n\n‘I don’t mind it.’\n\n‘There is danger in getting wet feet.’\n\n‘Yes...Harry, what is the matter?’\n\n‘Oh, nothing. Shall I resume the serious conversation I had with you\nlast night? No, perhaps not; perhaps I had better not.’\n\n‘Oh, I cannot tell! How wretched it all is! Ah, I wish you were your own\ndear self again, and had kissed me when I came up! Why didn’t you ask me\nfor one? why don’t you now?’\n\n‘Too free in manner by half,’ he heard murmur the voice within him.\n\n‘It was that hateful conversation last night,’ she went on. ‘Oh, those\nwords! Last night was a black night for me.’\n\n‘Kiss!--I hate that word! Don’t talk of kissing, for God’s sake! I\nshould think you might with advantage have shown tact enough to keep\nback that word “kiss,” considering those you have accepted.’\n\nShe became very pale, and a rigid and desolate charactery took\npossession of her face. That face was so delicate and tender in\nappearance now, that one could fancy the pressure of a finger upon it\nwould cause a livid spot.\n\nKnight walked on, and Elfride with him, silent and unopposing. He opened\na gate, and they entered a path across a stubble-field.\n\n‘Perhaps I intrude upon you?’ she said as he closed the gate. ‘Shall I\ngo away?’\n\n‘No. Listen to me, Elfride.’ Knight’s voice was low and unequal.\n‘I have been honest with you: will you be so with me? If\nany--strange--connection has existed between yourself and a predecessor\nof mine, tell it now. It is better that I know it now, even though the\nknowledge should part us, than that I should discover it in time to\ncome. And suspicions have been awakened in me. I think I will not say\nhow, because I despise the means. A discovery of any mystery of your\npast would embitter our lives.’\n\nKnight waited with a slow manner of calmness. His eyes were sad and\nimperative. They went farther along the path.\n\n‘Will you forgive me if I tell you all?’ she exclaimed entreatingly.\n\n‘I can’t promise; so much depends upon what you have to tell.’\n\nElfride could not endure the silence which followed.\n\n‘Are you not going to love me?’ she burst out. ‘Harry, Harry, love me,\nand speak as usual! Do; I beseech you, Harry!’\n\n‘Are you going to act fairly by me?’ said Knight, with rising anger; ‘or\nare you not? What have I done to you that I should be put off like this?\nBe caught like a bird in a springe; everything intended to be hidden\nfrom me! Why is it, Elfride? That’s what I ask you.’\n\nIn their agitation they had left the path, and were wandering among the\nwet and obstructive stubble, without knowing or heeding it.\n\n‘What have I done?’ she faltered.\n\n‘What? How can you ask what, when you know so well? You KNOW that I have\ndesignedly been kept in ignorance of something attaching to you, which,\nhad I known of it, might have altered all my conduct; and yet you say,\nwhat?’\n\nShe drooped visibly, and made no answer.\n\n‘Not that I believe in malicious letter-writers and whisperers; not I.\nI don’t know whether I do or don’t: upon my soul, I can’t tell. I know\nthis: a religion was building itself upon you in my heart. I looked\ninto your eyes, and thought I saw there truth and innocence as pure and\nperfect as ever embodied by God in the flesh of woman. Perfect truth is\ntoo much to expect, but ordinary truth I WILL HAVE or nothing at all.\nJust say, then; is the matter you keep back of the gravest importance,\nor is it not?’\n\n‘I don’t understand all your meaning. If I have hidden anything from\nyou, it has been because I loved you so, and I feared--feared--to lose\nyou.’\n\n‘Since you are not given to confidence, I want to ask you some plain\nquestions. Have I your permission?’\n\n‘Yes,’ she said, and there came over her face a weary resignation. ‘Say\nthe harshest words you can; I will bear them!’\n\n‘There is a scandal in the air concerning you, Elfride; and I cannot\neven combat it without knowing definitely what it is. It may not refer\nto you entirely, or even at all.’ Knight trifled in the very bitterness\nof his feeling. ‘In the time of the French Revolution, Pariseau, a\nballet-master, was beheaded by mistake for Parisot, a captain of\nthe King’s Guard. I wish there was another “E. Swancourt” in the\nneighbourhood. Look at this.’\n\nHe handed her the letter she had written and left on the table at Mrs.\nJethway’s. She looked over it vacantly.\n\n‘It is not so much as it seems!’ she pleaded. ‘It seems wickedly\ndeceptive to look at now, but it had a much more natural origin than you\nthink. My sole wish was not to endanger our love. O Harry! that was all\nmy idea. It was not much harm.’\n\n‘Yes, yes; but independently of the poor miserable creature’s remarks,\nit seems to imply--something wrong.’\n\n‘What remarks?’\n\n‘Those she wrote me--now torn to pieces. Elfride, DID you run away\nwith a man you loved?--that was the damnable statement. Has such an\naccusation life in it--really, truly, Elfride?’\n\n‘Yes,’ she whispered.\n\nKnight’s countenance sank. ‘To be married to him?’ came huskily from his\nlips.\n\n‘Yes. Oh, forgive me! I had never seen you, Harry.’\n\n‘To London?’\n\n‘Yes; but I----’\n\n‘Answer my questions; say nothing else, Elfride Did you ever\ndeliberately try to marry him in secret?’\n\n‘No; not deliberately.’\n\n‘But did you do it?’\n\nA feeble red passed over her face.\n\n‘Yes,’ she said.\n\n‘And after that--did you--write to him as your husband; and did he\naddress you as his wife?’\n\n‘Listen, listen! It was----’\n\n‘Do answer me; only answer me!’\n\n‘Then, yes, we did.’ Her lips shook; but it was with some little dignity\nthat she continued: ‘I would gladly have told you; for I knew and know I\nhad done wrong. But I dared not; I loved you too well. Oh, so well! You\nhave been everything in the world to me--and you are now. Will you not\nforgive me?’\n\nIt is a melancholy thought, that men who at first will not allow the\nverdict of perfection they pronounce upon their sweethearts or wives\nto be disturbed by God’s own testimony to the contrary, will, once\nsuspecting their purity, morally hang them upon evidence they would be\nashamed to admit in judging a dog.\n\nThe reluctance to tell, which arose from Elfride’s simplicity in\nthinking herself so much more culpable than she really was, had been\ndoing fatal work in Knight’s mind. The man of many ideas, now that\nhis first dream of impossible things was over, vibrated too far in\nthe contrary direction; and her every movement of feature--every\ntremor--every confused word--was taken as so much proof of her\nunworthiness.\n\n‘Elfride, we must bid good-bye to compliment,’ said Knight: ‘we must\ndo without politeness now. Look in my face, and as you believe in God\nabove, tell me truly one thing more. Were you away alone with him?’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘Did you return home the same day on which you left it?’\n\n‘No.’\n\nThe word fell like a bolt, and the very land and sky seemed to suffer.\nKnight turned aside. Meantime Elfride’s countenance wore a look\nindicating utter despair of being able to explain matters so that they\nwould seem no more than they really were,--a despair which not only\nrelinquishes the hope of direct explanation, but wearily gives up all\ncollateral chances of extenuation.\n\nThe scene was engraved for years on the retina of Knight’s eye: the\ndead and brown stubble, the weeds among it, the distant belt of beeches\nshutting out the view of the house, the leaves of which were now red and\nsick to death.\n\n‘You must forget me,’ he said. ‘We shall not marry, Elfride.’\n\nHow much anguish passed into her soul at those words from him was told\nby the look of supreme torture she wore.\n\n‘What meaning have you, Harry? You only say so, do you?’\n\nShe looked doubtingly up at him, and tried to laugh, as if the unreality\nof his words must be unquestionable.\n\n‘You are not in earnest, I know--I hope you are not? Surely I belong to\nyou, and you are going to keep me for yours?’\n\n‘Elfride, I have been speaking too roughly to you; I have said what I\nought only to have thought. I like you; and let me give you a word of\nadvice. Marry your man as soon as you can. However weary of each other\nyou may feel, you belong to each other, and I am not going to step\nbetween you. Do you think I would--do you think I could for a moment? If\nyou cannot marry him now, and another makes you his wife, do not reveal\nthis secret to him after marriage, if you do not before. Honesty would\nbe damnation then.’\n\nBewildered by his expressions, she exclaimed--\n\n‘No, no; I will not be a wife unless I am yours; and I must be yours!’\n\n‘If we had married----’\n\n‘But you don’t MEAN--that--that--you will go away and leave me, and not\nbe anything more to me--oh, you don’t!’\n\nConvulsive sobs took all nerve out of her utterance. She checked them,\nand continued to look in his face for the ray of hope that was not to be\nfound there.\n\n‘I am going indoors,’ said Knight. ‘You will not follow me, Elfride; I\nwish you not to.’\n\n‘Oh no; indeed, I will not.’\n\n‘And then I am going to Castle Boterel. Good-bye.’\n\nHe spoke the farewell as if it were but for the day--lightly, as he had\nspoken such temporary farewells many times before--and she seemed to\nunderstand it as such. Knight had not the power to tell her plainly that\nhe was going for ever; he hardly knew for certain that he was: whether\nhe should rush back again upon the current of an irresistible emotion,\nor whether he could sufficiently conquer himself, and her in him, to\nestablish that parting as a supreme farewell, and present himself to the\nworld again as no woman’s.\n\nTen minutes later he had left the house, leaving directions that if he\ndid not return in the evening his luggage was to be sent to his chambers\nin London, whence he intended to write to Mr. Swancourt as to the\nreasons of his sudden departure. He descended the valley, and could not\nforbear turning his head. He saw the stubble-field, and a slight girlish\nfigure in the midst of it--up against the sky. Elfride, docile as ever,\nhad hardly moved a step, for he had said, Remain. He looked and saw her\nagain--he saw her for weeks and months. He withdrew his eyes from\nthe scene, swept his hand across them, as if to brush away the sight,\nbreathed a low groan, and went on.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXV\n\n     ‘And wilt thou leave me thus?--say nay--say nay!’\n\n\nThe scene shifts to Knight’s chambers in Bede’s Inn. It was late in the\nevening of the day following his departure from Endelstow. A drizzling\nrain descended upon London, forming a humid and dreary halo over every\nwell-lighted street. The rain had not yet been prevalent long enough to\ngive to rapid vehicles that clear and distinct rattle which follows\nthe thorough washing of the stones by a drenching rain, but was just\nsufficient to make footway and roadway slippery, adhesive, and clogging\nto both feet and wheels.\n\nKnight was standing by the fire, looking into its expiring embers,\npreviously to emerging from his door for a dreary journey home to\nRichmond. His hat was on, and the gas turned off. The blind of the\nwindow overlooking the alley was not drawn down; and with the light from\nbeneath, which shone over the ceiling of the room, came, in place of the\nusual babble, only the reduced clatter and quick speech which were the\nresult of necessity rather than choice.\n\nWhilst he thus stood, waiting for the expiration of the few minutes that\nwere wanting to the time for his catching the train, a light tapping\nupon the door mingled with the other sounds that reached his ears. It\nwas so faint at first that the outer noises were almost sufficient to\ndrown it. Finding it repeated Knight crossed the lobby, crowded with\nbooks and rubbish, and opened the door.\n\nA woman, closely muffled up, but visibly of fragile build, was standing\non the landing under the gaslight. She sprang forward, flung her arms\nround Knight’s neck, and uttered a low cry--\n\n‘O Harry, Harry, you are killing me! I could not help coming. Don’t send\nme away--don’t! Forgive your Elfride for coming--I love you so!’\n\nKnight’s agitation and astonishment mastered him for a few moments.\n\n‘Elfride!’ he cried, ‘what does this mean? What have you done?’\n\n‘Do not hurt me and punish me--Oh, do not! I couldn’t help coming; it\nwas killing me. Last night, when you did not come back, I could not bear\nit--I could not! Only let me be with you, and see your face, Harry; I\ndon’t ask for more.’\n\nHer eyelids were hot, heavy, and thick with excessive weeping, and\nthe delicate rose-red of her cheeks was disfigured and inflamed by the\nconstant chafing of the handkerchief in wiping her many tears.\n\n‘Who is with you? Have you come alone?’ he hurriedly inquired.\n\n‘Yes. When you did not come last night, I sat up hoping you would\ncome--and the night was all agony--and I waited on and on, and you did\nnot come! Then when it was morning, and your letter said you were gone,\nI could not endure it; and I ran away from them to St. Launce’s, and\ncame by the train. And I have been all day travelling to you, and you\nwon’t make me go away again, will you, Harry, because I shall always\nlove you till I die?’\n\n‘Yet it is wrong for you to stay. O Elfride! what have you committed\nyourself to? It is ruin to your good name to run to me like this!\nHas not your first experience been sufficient to keep you from these\nthings?’\n\n‘My name! Harry, I shall soon die, and what good will my name be to me\nthen? Oh, could I but be the man and you the woman, I would not leave\nyou for such a little fault as mine! Do not think it was so vile a thing\nin me to run away with him. Ah, how I wish you could have run away with\ntwenty women before you knew me, that I might show you I would think it\nno fault, but be glad to get you after them all, so that I had you! If\nyou only knew me through and through, how true I am, Harry. Cannot I be\nyours? Say you love me just the same, and don’t let me be separated from\nyou again, will you? I cannot bear it--all the long hours and days and\nnights going on, and you not there, but away because you hate me!’\n\n‘Not hate you, Elfride,’ he said gently, and supported her with his arm.\n‘But you cannot stay here now--just at present, I mean.’\n\n‘I suppose I must not--I wish I might. I am afraid that if--you lose\nsight of me--something dark will happen, and we shall not meet again.\nHarry, if I am not good enough to be your wife, I wish I could be your\nservant and live with you, and not be sent away never to see you again.\nI don’t mind what it is except that!’\n\n‘No, I cannot send you away: I cannot. God knows what dark future may\narise out of this evening’s work; but I cannot send you away! You must\nsit down, and I will endeavour to collect my thoughts and see what had\nbetter be done.\n\nAt that moment a loud knocking at the house door was heard by both,\naccompanied by a hurried ringing of the bell that echoed from attic to\nbasement. The door was quickly opened, and after a few hasty words of\nconverse in the hall, heavy footsteps ascended the stairs.\n\nThe face of Mr. Swancourt, flushed, grieved, and stern, appeared round\nthe landing of the staircase. He came higher up, and stood beside them.\nGlancing over and past Knight with silent indignation, he turned to the\ntrembling girl.\n\n‘O Elfride! and have I found you at last? Are these your tricks, madam?\nWhen will you get rid of your idiocies, and conduct yourself like a\ndecent woman? Is my family name and house to be disgraced by acts that\nwould be a scandal to a washerwoman’s daughter? Come along, madam;\ncome!’\n\n‘She is so weary!’ said Knight, in a voice of intensest anguish. ‘Mr.\nSwancourt, don’t be harsh with her--let me beg of you to be tender with\nher, and love her!’\n\n‘To you, sir,’ said Mr. Swancourt, turning to him as if by the sheer\npressure of circumstances, ‘I have little to say. I can only remark,\nthat the sooner I can retire from your presence the better I shall be\npleased. Why you could not conduct your courtship of my daughter like an\nhonest man, I do not know. Why she--a foolish inexperienced girl--should\nhave been tempted to this piece of folly, I do not know. Even if she\nhad not known better than to leave her home, you might have, I should\nthink.’\n\n‘It is not his fault: he did not tempt me, papa! I came.’\n\n‘If you wished the marriage broken off, why didn’t you say so plainly?\nIf you never intended to marry, why could you not leave her alone? Upon\nmy soul, it grates me to the heart to be obliged to think so ill of a\nman I thought my friend!’\n\nKnight, soul-sick and weary of his life, did not arouse himself to utter\na word in reply. How should he defend himself when his defence was the\naccusation of Elfride? On that account he felt a miserable satisfaction\nin letting her father go on thinking and speaking wrongfully. It was a\nfaint ray of pleasure straying into the great gloominess of his brain to\nthink that the vicar might never know but that he, as her lover, tempted\nher away, which seemed to be the form Mr. Swancourt’s misapprehension\nhad taken.\n\n‘Now, are you coming?’ said Mr. Swancourt to her again. He took her\nunresisting hand, drew it within his arm, and led her down the stairs.\nKnight’s eyes followed her, the last moment begetting in him a frantic\nhope that she would turn her head. She passed on, and never looked back.\n\nHe heard the door open--close again. The wheels of a cab grazed the\nkerbstone, a murmured direction followed. The door was slammed together,\nthe wheels moved, and they rolled away.\n\n\nFrom that hour of her reappearance a dreadful conflict raged within\nthe breast of Henry Knight. His instinct, emotion, affectiveness--or\nwhatever it may be called--urged him to stand forward, seize upon\nElfride, and be her cherisher and protector through life. Then came\nthe devastating thought that Elfride’s childlike, unreasoning, and\nindiscreet act in flying to him only proved that the proprieties must be\na dead letter with her; that the unreserve, which was really artlessness\nwithout ballast, meant indifference to decorum; and what so likely as\nthat such a woman had been deceived in the past? He said to himself,\nin a mood of the bitterest cynicism: ‘The suspicious discreet woman who\nimagines dark and evil things of all her fellow-creatures is far too\nshrewd to be deluded by man: trusting beings like Elfride are the women\nwho fall.’\n\nHours and days went by, and Knight remained inactive. Lengthening\ntime, which made fainter the heart-awakening power of her presence,\nstrengthened the mental ability to reason her down. Elfride loved him,\nhe knew, and he could not leave off loving her but marry her he would\nnot. If she could but be again his own Elfride--the woman she had seemed\nto be--but that woman was dead and buried, and he knew her no more! And\nhow could he marry this Elfride, one who, if he had originally seen her\nas she was, would have been barely an interesting pitiable acquaintance\nin his eyes--no more?\n\nIt cankered his heart to think he was confronted by the closest instance\nof a worse state of things than any he had assumed in the pleasant\nsocial philosophy and satire of his essays.\n\nThe moral rightness of this man’s life was worthy of all praise; but in\nspite of some intellectual acumen, Knight had in him a modicum of that\nwrongheadedness which is mostly found in scrupulously honest people.\nWith him, truth seemed too clean and pure an abstraction to be so\nhopelessly churned in with error as practical persons find it. Having\nnow seen himself mistaken in supposing Elfride to be peerless, nothing\non earth could make him believe she was not so very bad after all.\n\nHe lingered in town a fortnight, doing little else than vibrate between\npassion and opinions. One idea remained intact--that it was better\nElfride and himself should not meet.\n\nWhen he surveyed the volumes on his shelves--few of which had been\nopened since Elfride first took possession of his heart--their untouched\nand orderly arrangement reproached him as an apostate from the old faith\nof his youth and early manhood. He had deserted those never-failing\nfriends, so they seemed to say, for an unstable delight in a ductile\nwoman, which had ended all in bitterness. The spirit of self-denial,\nverging on asceticism, which had ever animated Knight in old times,\nannounced itself as having departed with the birth of love, with it\nhaving gone the self-respect which had compensated for the lack\nof self-gratification. Poor little Elfride, instead of holding,\nas formerly, a place in his religion, began to assume the hue of a\ntemptation. Perhaps it was human and correctly natural that Knight\nnever once thought whether he did not owe her a little sacrifice for her\nunchary devotion in saving his life.\n\nWith a consciousness of having thus, like Antony, kissed away kingdoms\nand provinces, he next considered how he had revealed his higher secrets\nand intentions to her, an unreserve he would never have allowed himself\nwith any man living. How was it that he had not been able to refrain\nfrom telling her of adumbrations heretofore locked in the closest\nstrongholds of his mind?\n\nKnight’s was a robust intellect, which could escape outside the\natmosphere of heart, and perceive that his own love, as well as other\npeople’s, could be reduced by change of scene and circumstances. At the\nsame time the perception was a superimposed sorrow:\n\n\n      ‘O last regret, regret can die!’\n\n\nBut being convinced that the death of this regret was the best thing for\nhim, he did not long shrink from attempting it. He closed his chambers,\nsuspended his connection with editors, and left London for the\nContinent. Here we will leave him to wander without purpose, beyond the\nnominal one of encouraging obliviousness of Elfride.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVI\n\n     ‘The pennie’s the jewel that beautifies a’.’\n\n\n‘I can’t think what’s coming to these St. Launce’s people at all at\nall.’\n\n‘With their “How-d’ye-do’s,” do you mean?’\n\n‘Ay, with their “How-d’ye-do’s,” and shaking of hands, asking me in, and\ntender inquiries for you, John.’\n\nThese words formed part of a conversation between John Smith and\nhis wife on a Saturday evening in the spring which followed Knight’s\ndeparture from England. Stephen had long since returned to India; and\nthe persevering couple themselves had migrated from Lord Luxellian’s\npark at Endelstow to a comfortable roadside dwelling about a mile out of\nSt. Launce’s, where John had opened a small stone and slate yard in his\nown name.\n\n‘When we came here six months ago,’ continued Mrs. Smith, ‘though I\nhad paid ready money so many years in the town, my friskier shopkeepers\nwould only speak over the counter. Meet ‘em in the street half-an-hour\nafter, and they’d treat me with staring ignorance of my face.’\n\n‘Look through ye as through a glass winder?’\n\n‘Yes, the brazen ones would. The quiet and cool ones would glance over\nthe top of my head, past my side, over my shoulder, but never meet my\neye. The gentle-modest would turn their faces south if I were coming\neast, flit down a passage if I were about to halve the pavement with\nthem. There was the spruce young bookseller would play the same tricks;\nthe butcher’s daughters; the upholsterer’s young men. Hand in glove\nwhen doing business out of sight with you; but caring nothing for a’ old\nwoman when playing the genteel away from all signs of their trade.’\n\n‘True enough, Maria.’\n\n‘Well, to-day ‘tis all different. I’d no sooner got to market than Mrs.\nJoakes rushed up to me in the eyes of the town and said, “My dear Mrs.\nSmith, now you must be tired with your walk! Come in and have some\nlunch! I insist upon it; knowing you so many years as I have! Don’t you\nremember when we used to go looking for owls’ feathers together in the\nCastle ruins?” There’s no knowing what you may need, so I answered the\nwoman civilly. I hadn’t got to the corner before that thriving young\nlawyer, Sweet, who’s quite the dandy, ran after me out of breath. “Mrs.\nSmith,” he says, “excuse my rudeness, but there’s a bramble on the tail\nof your dress, which you’ve dragged in from the country; allow me to\npull it off for you.” If you’ll believe me, this was in the very front\nof the Town Hall. What’s the meaning of such sudden love for a’ old\nwoman?’\n\n‘Can’t say; unless ‘tis repentance.’\n\n‘Repentance! was there ever such a fool as you. John? Did anybody ever\nrepent with money in’s pocket and fifty years to live?’\n\n‘Now, I’ve been thinking too,’ said John, passing over the query as\nhardly pertinent, ‘that I’ve had more loving-kindness from folks to-day\nthan I ever have before since we moved here. Why, old Alderman Tope\nwalked out to the middle of the street where I was, to shake hands with\nme--so ‘a did. Having on my working clothes, I thought ‘twas odd. Ay,\nand there was young Werrington.’\n\n‘Who’s he?’\n\n‘Why, the man in Hill Street, who plays and sells flutes, trumpets, and\nfiddles, and grand pehanners. He was talking to Egloskerry, that very\nsmall bachelor-man with money in the funds. I was going by, I’m sure,\nwithout thinking or expecting a nod from men of that glib kidney when in\nmy working clothes----’\n\n‘You always will go poking into town in your working clothes. Beg you to\nchange how I will, ‘tis no use.’\n\n‘Well, however, I was in my working clothes. Werrington saw me. “Ah, Mr.\nSmith! a fine morning; excellent weather for building,” says he, out as\nloud and friendly as if I’d met him in some deep hollow, where he could\nget nobody else to speak to at all. ‘Twas odd: for Werrington is one of\nthe very ringleaders of the fast class.’\n\nAt that moment a tap came to the door. The door was immediately opened\nby Mrs. Smith in person.\n\n‘You’ll excuse us, I’m sure, Mrs. Smith, but this beautiful spring\nweather was too much for us. Yes, and we could stay in no longer; and I\ntook Mrs. Trewen upon my arm directly we’d had a cup of tea, and out we\ncame. And seeing your beautiful crocuses in such a bloom, we’ve taken\nthe liberty to enter. We’ll step round the garden, if you don’t mind.’\n\n‘Not at all,’ said Mrs. Smith; and they walked round the garden.\nShe lifted her hands in amazement directly their backs were turned.\n‘Goodness send us grace!’\n\n‘Who be they?’ said her husband.\n\n‘Actually Mr. Trewen, the bank-manager, and his wife.’\n\nJohn Smith, staggered in mind, went out of doors and looked over the\ngarden gate, to collect his ideas. He had not been there two minutes\nwhen wheels were heard, and a carriage and pair rolled along the road.\nA distinguished-looking lady, with the demeanour of a duchess, reclined\nwithin. When opposite Smith’s gate she turned her head, and instantly\ncommanded the coachman to stop.\n\n‘Ah, Mr. Smith, I am glad to see you looking so well. I could not help\nstopping a moment to congratulate you and Mrs. Smith upon the happiness\nyou must enjoy. Joseph, you may drive on.’\n\nAnd the carriage rolled away towards St. Launce’s.\n\nOut rushed Mrs. Smith from behind a laurel-bush, where she had stood\npondering.\n\n‘Just going to touch my hat to her,’ said John; ‘just for all the world\nas I would have to poor Lady Luxellian years ago.’\n\n‘Lord! who is she?’\n\n‘The public-house woman--what’s her name? Mrs.--Mrs.--at the Falcon.’\n\n‘Public-house woman. The clumsiness of the Smith family! You MIGHT say\nthe landlady of the Falcon Hotel, since we are in for politeness. The\npeople are ridiculous enough, but give them their due.’\n\nThe possibility is that Mrs. Smith was getting mollified, in spite of\nherself, by these remarkably friendly phenomena among the people of St.\nLaunce’s. And in justice to them it was quite desirable that she should\ndo so. The interest which the unpractised ones of this town expressed so\ngrotesquely was genuine of its kind, and equal in intrinsic worth to the\nmore polished smiles of larger communities.\n\nBy this time Mr. and Mrs. Trewen were returning from the garden.\n\n‘I’ll ask ‘em flat,’ whispered John to his wife. ‘I’ll say, “We be in a\nfog--you’ll excuse my asking a question, Mr. and Mrs. Trewen. How is it\nyou all be so friendly to-day?” Hey? ‘Twould sound right and sensible,\nwouldn’t it?’\n\n‘Not a word! Good mercy, when will the man have manners!’\n\n‘It must be a proud moment for you, I am sure, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, to\nhave a son so celebrated,’ said the bank-manager advancing.\n\n‘Ah, ‘tis Stephen--I knew it!’ said Mrs. Smith triumphantly to herself.\n\n‘We don’t know particulars,’ said John.\n\n‘Not know!’\n\n‘No.’\n\n‘Why, ‘tis all over town. Our worthy Mayor alluded to it in a speech at\nthe dinner last night of the Every-Man-his-own-Maker Club.’\n\n‘And what about Stephen?’ urged Mrs. Smith.\n\n‘Why, your son has been feted by deputy-governors and Parsee princes\nand nobody-knows-who in India; is hand in glove with nabobs, and is to\ndesign a large palace, and cathedral, and hospitals, colleges, halls,\nand fortifications, by the general consent of the ruling powers,\nChristian and Pagan alike.’\n\n‘’Twas sure to come to the boy,’ said Mr. Smith unassumingly.\n\n‘’Tis in yesterday’s St. Launce’s Chronicle; and our worthy Mayor in the\nchair introduced the subject into his speech last night in a masterly\nmanner.’\n\n‘’Twas very good of the worthy Mayor in the chair I’m sure,’ said\nStephen’s mother. ‘I hope the boy will have the sense to keep what he’s\ngot; but as for men, they are a simple sex. Some woman will hook him.’\n\n‘Well, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, the evening closes in, and we must be going;\nand remember this, that every Saturday when you come in to market, you\nare to make our house as your own. There will be always a tea-cup and\nsaucer for you, as you know there has been for months, though you may\nhave forgotten it. I’m a plain-speaking woman, and what I say I mean.’\n\nWhen the visitors were gone, and the sun had set, and the moon’s rays\nwere just beginning to assert themselves upon the walls of the dwelling,\nJohn Smith and his wife sat dawn to the newspaper they had hastily\nprocured from the town. And when the reading was done, they considered\nhow best to meet the new social requirements settling upon them,\nwhich Mrs. Smith considered could be done by new furniture and house\nenlargement alone.\n\n‘And, John, mind one thing,’ she said in conclusion. ‘In writing to\nStephen, never by any means mention the name of Elfride Swancourt again.\nWe’ve left the place, and know no more about her except by hearsay. He\nseems to be getting free of her, and glad am I for it. It was a cloudy\nhour for him when he first set eyes upon the girl. That family’s been no\ngood to him, first or last; so let them keep their blood to themselves\nif they want to. He thinks of her, I know, but not so hopelessly. So\ndon’t try to know anything about her, and we can’t answer his questions.\nShe may die out of his mind then.’\n\n‘That shall be it,’ said John.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVII\n\n     ‘After many days.’\n\n\nKnight roamed south, under colour of studying Continental antiquities.\n\nHe paced the lofty aisles of Amiens, loitered by Ardennes Abbey, climbed\ninto the strange towers of Laon, analyzed Noyon and Rheims. Then he went\nto Chartres, and examined its scaly spires and quaint carving then he\nidled about Coutances. He rowed beneath the base of Mont St. Michel, and\ncaught the varied skyline of the crumbling edifices encrusting it.\nSt. Ouen’s, Rouen, knew him for days; so did Vezelay, Sens, and many a\nhallowed monument besides. Abandoning the inspection of early French art\nwith the same purposeless haste as he had shown in undertaking it, he\nwent further, and lingered about Ferrara, Padua, and Pisa. Satiated with\nmediaevalism, he tried the Roman Forum. Next he observed moonlight and\nstarlight effects by the bay of Naples. He turned to Austria, became\nenervated and depressed on Hungarian and Bohemian plains, and was\nrefreshed again by breezes on the declivities of the Carpathians.\n\nThen he found himself in Greece. He visited the plain of Marathon, and\nstrove to imagine the Persian defeat; to Mars Hill, to picture St. Paul\naddressing the ancient Athenians; to Thermopylae and Salamis, to run\nthrough the facts and traditions of the Second Invasion--the result of\nhis endeavours being more or less chaotic. Knight grew as weary of these\nplaces as of all others. Then he felt the shock of an earthquake in the\nIonian Islands, and went to Venice. Here he shot in gondolas up and down\nthe winding thoroughfare of the Grand Canal, and loitered on calle and\npiazza at night, when the lagunes were undisturbed by a ripple, and no\nsound was to be heard but the stroke of the midnight clock. Afterwards\nhe remained for weeks in the museums, galleries, and libraries of\nVienna, Berlin, and Paris; and thence came home.\n\nTime thus rolls us on to a February afternoon, divided by fifteen months\nfrom the parting of Elfride and her lover in the brown stubble field\ntowards the sea.\n\nTwo men obviously not Londoners, and with a touch of foreignness in\ntheir look, met by accident on one of the gravel walks leading across\nHyde Park. The younger, more given to looking about him than his fellow,\nsaw and noticed the approach of his senior some time before the latter\nhad raised his eyes from the ground, upon which they were bent in an\nabstracted gaze that seemed habitual with him.\n\n‘Mr. Knight--indeed it is!’ exclaimed the younger man.\n\n‘Ah, Stephen Smith!’ said Knight.\n\nSimultaneous operations might now have been observed progressing in\nboth, the result being that an expression less frank and impulsive than\nthe first took possession of their features. It was manifest that the\nnext words uttered were a superficial covering to constraint on both\nsides.\n\n‘Have you been in England long?’ said Knight.\n\n‘Only two days,’ said Smith.\n\n‘India ever since?’\n\n‘Nearly ever since.’\n\n‘They were making a fuss about you at St. Launce’s last year. I fancy I\nsaw something of the sort in the papers.’\n\n‘Yes; I believe something was said about me.’\n\n‘I must congratulate you on your achievements.’\n\n‘Thanks, but they are nothing very extraordinary. A natural professional\nprogress where there was no opposition.’\n\nThere followed that want of words which will always assert itself\nbetween nominal friends who find they have ceased to be real ones, and\nhave not yet sunk to the level of mere acquaintance. Each looked up\nand down the Park. Knight may possibly have borne in mind during the\nintervening months Stephen’s manner towards him the last time they had\nmet, and may have encouraged his former interest in Stephen’s welfare to\ndie out of him as misplaced. Stephen certainly was full of the feelings\nbegotten by the belief that Knight had taken away the woman he loved so\nwell.\n\nStephen Smith then asked a question, adopting a certain recklessness of\nmanner and tone to hide, if possible, the fact that the subject was a\nmuch greater one to him than his friend had ever supposed.\n\n‘Are you married?’\n\n‘I am not.’\n\nKnight spoke in an indescribable tone of bitterness that was almost\nmoroseness.\n\n‘And I never shall be,’ he added decisively. ‘Are you?’\n\n‘No,’ said Stephen, sadly and quietly, like a man in a sick-room.\nTotally ignorant whether or not Knight knew of his own previous claims\nupon Elfride, he yet resolved to hazard a few more words upon the topic\nwhich had an aching fascination for him even now.\n\n‘Then your engagement to Miss Swancourt came to nothing,’ he said. ‘You\nremember I met you with her once?’\n\nStephen’s voice gave way a little here, in defiance of his firmest will\nto the contrary. Indian affairs had not yet lowered those emotions down\nto the point of control.\n\n‘It was broken off,’ came quickly from Knight. ‘Engagements to marry\noften end like that--for better or for worse.’\n\n‘Yes; so they do. And what have you been doing lately?’\n\n‘Doing? Nothing.’\n\n‘Where have you been?’\n\n‘I can hardly tell you. In the main, going about Europe; and it may\nperhaps interest you to know that I have been attempting the serious\nstudy of Continental art of the Middle Ages. My notes on each example I\nvisited are at your service. They are of no use to me.’\n\n‘I shall be glad with them....Oh, travelling far and near!’\n\n‘Not far,’ said Knight, with moody carelessness. ‘You know, I daresay,\nthat sheep occasionally become giddy--hydatids in the head, ‘tis called,\nin which their brains become eaten up, and the animal exhibits the\nstrange peculiarity of walking round and round in a circle continually.\nI have travelled just in the same way--round and round like a giddy\nram.’\n\nThe reckless, bitter, and rambling style in which Knight talked, as if\nrather to vent his images than to convey any ideas to Stephen, struck\nthe young man painfully. His former friend’s days had become cankered in\nsome way: Knight was a changed man. He himself had changed much, but not\nas Knight had changed.\n\n‘Yesterday I came home,’ continued Knight, ‘without having, to the best\nof my belief, imbibed half-a-dozen ideas worth retaining.’\n\n‘You out-Hamlet Hamlet in morbidness of mood,’ said Stephen, with\nregretful frankness.\n\nKnight made no reply.\n\n‘Do you know,’ Stephen continued, ‘I could almost have sworn that you\nwould be married before this time, from what I saw?’\n\nKnight’s face grew harder. ‘Could you?’ he said.\n\nStephen was powerless to forsake the depressing, luring subject.\n\n‘Yes; and I simply wonder at it.’\n\n‘Whom did you expect me to marry?’\n\n‘Her I saw you with.’\n\n‘Thank you for that wonder.’\n\n‘Did she jilt you?’\n\n‘Smith, now one word to you,’ Knight returned steadily. ‘Don’t you ever\nquestion me on that subject. I have a reason for making this request,\nmind. And if you do question me, you will not get an answer.’\n\n‘Oh, I don’t for a moment wish to ask what is unpleasant to you--not I.\nI had a momentary feeling that I should like to explain something on my\nside, and hear a similar explanation on yours. But let it go, let it go,\nby all means.’\n\n‘What would you explain?’\n\n‘I lost the woman I was going to marry: you have not married as you\nintended. We might have compared notes.’\n\n‘I have never asked you a word about your case.’\n\n‘I know that.’\n\n‘And the inference is obvious.’\n\n‘Quite so.’\n\n‘The truth is, Stephen, I have doggedly resolved never to allude to the\nmatter--for which I have a very good reason.’\n\n‘Doubtless. As good a reason as you had for not marrying her.’\n\n‘You talk insidiously. I had a good one--a miserably good one!’\n\nSmith’s anxiety urged him to venture one more question.\n\n‘Did she not love you enough?’ He drew his breath in a slow and\nattenuated stream, as he waited in timorous hope for the answer.\n\n‘Stephen, you rather strain ordinary courtesy in pressing questions of\nthat kind after what I have said. I cannot understand you at all. I must\ngo on now.’\n\n‘Why, good God!’ exclaimed Stephen passionately, ‘you talk as if you\nhadn’t at all taken her away from anybody who had better claims to her\nthan you!’\n\n‘What do you mean by that?’ said Knight, with a puzzled air. ‘What have\nyou heard?’\n\n‘Nothing. I too must go on. Good-day.’\n\n‘If you will go,’ said Knight, reluctantly now, ‘you must, I suppose. I\nam sure I cannot understand why you behave so.’\n\n‘Nor I why you do. I have always been grateful to you, and as far as I\nam concerned we need never have become so estranged as we have.’\n\n‘And have I ever been anything but well-disposed towards you, Stephen?\nSurely you know that I have not! The system of reserve began with you:\nyou know that.’\n\n‘No, no! You altogether mistake our position. You were always from the\nfirst reserved to me, though I was confidential to you. That was, I\nsuppose, the natural issue of our differing positions in life. And when\nI, the pupil, became reserved like you, the master, you did not like it.\nHowever, I was going to ask you to come round and see me.’\n\n‘Where are you staying?’\n\n‘At the Grosvenor Hotel, Pimlico.’\n\n‘So am I.’\n\n‘That’s convenient, not to say odd. Well, I am detained in London for a\nday or two; then I am going down to see my father and mother, who live\nat St. Launce’s now. Will you see me this evening?’\n\n‘I may; but I will not promise. I was wishing to be alone for an hour or\ntwo; but I shall know where to find you, at any rate. Good-bye.’\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVIII\n\n     ‘Jealousy is cruel as the grave.’\n\n\nStephen pondered not a little on this meeting with his old friend and\nonce-beloved exemplar. He was grieved, for amid all the distractions of\nhis latter years a still small voice of fidelity to Knight had lingered\non in him. Perhaps this staunchness was because Knight ever treated him\nas a mere disciple--even to snubbing him sometimes; and had at last,\nthough unwittingly, inflicted upon him the greatest snub of all, that of\ntaking away his sweetheart. The emotional side of his constitution was\nbuilt rather after a feminine than a male model; and that tremendous\nwound from Knight’s hand may have tended to keep alive a warmth which\nsolicitousness would have extinguished altogether.\n\nKnight, on his part, was vexed, after they had parted, that he had not\ntaken Stephen in hand a little after the old manner. Those words which\nSmith had let fall concerning somebody having a prior claim to Elfride,\nwould, if uttered when the man was younger, have provoked such a query\nas, ‘Come, tell me all about it, my lad,’ from Knight, and Stephen would\nstraightway have delivered himself of all he knew on the subject.\n\nStephen the ingenuous boy, though now obliterated externally by Stephen\nthe contriving man, returned to Knight’s memory vividly that afternoon.\nHe was at present but a sojourner in London; and after attending to the\ntwo or three matters of business which remained to be done that day, he\nwalked abstractedly into the gloomy corridors of the British Museum for\nthe half-hour previous to their closing. That meeting with Smith had\nreunited the present with the past, closing up the chasm of his absence\nfrom England as if it had never existed, until the final circumstances\nof his previous time of residence in London formed but a yesterday\nto the circumstances now. The conflict that then had raged in him\nconcerning Elfride Swancourt revived, strengthened by its sleep. Indeed,\nin those many months of absence, though quelling the intention to make\nher his wife, he had never forgotten that she was the type of woman\nadapted to his nature; and instead of trying to obliterate thoughts\nof her altogether, he had grown to regard them as an infirmity it was\nnecessary to tolerate.\n\nKnight returned to his hotel much earlier in the evening than he would\nhave done in the ordinary course of things. He did not care to think\nwhether this arose from a friendly wish to close the gap that had slowly\nbeen widening between himself and his earliest acquaintance, or from\na hankering desire to hear the meaning of the dark oracles Stephen had\nhastily pronounced, betokening that he knew something more of Elfride\nthan Knight had supposed.\n\nHe made a hasty dinner, inquired for Smith, and soon was ushered\ninto the young man’s presence, whom he found sitting in front of\na comfortable fire, beside a table spread with a few scientific\nperiodicals and art reviews.\n\n‘I have come to you, after all,’ said Knight. ‘My manner was odd this\nmorning, and it seemed desirable to call; but that you had too much\nsense to notice, Stephen, I know. Put it down to my wanderings in France\nand Italy.’\n\n‘Don’t say another word, but sit down. I am only too glad to see you\nagain.’\n\nStephen would hardly have cared to tell Knight just then that the minute\nbefore Knight was announced he had been reading over some old letters\nof Elfride’s. They were not many; and until to-night had been sealed\nup, and stowed away in a corner of his leather trunk, with a few other\nmementoes and relics which had accompanied him in his travels. The\nfamiliar sights and sounds of London, the meeting with his friend, had\nwith him also revived that sense of abiding continuity with regard to\nElfride and love which his absence at the other side of the world had to\nsome extent suspended, though never ruptured. He at first intended\nonly to look over these letters on the outside; then he read one; then\nanother; until the whole was thus re-used as a stimulus to sad memories.\nHe folded them away again, placed them in his pocket, and instead of\ngoing on with an examination into the state of the artistic world, had\nremained musing on the strange circumstance that he had returned to find\nKnight not the husband of Elfride after all.\n\nThe possibility of any given gratification begets a cumulative sense of\nits necessity. Stephen gave the rein to his imagination, and felt more\nintensely than he had felt for many months that, without Elfride, his\nlife would never be any great pleasure to himself, or honour to his\nMaker.\n\nThey sat by the fire, chatting on external and random subjects, neither\ncaring to be the first to approach the matter each most longed\nto discuss. On the table with the periodicals lay two or three\npocket-books, one of them being open. Knight seeing from the exposed\npage that the contents were sketches only, began turning the leaves over\ncarelessly with his finger. When, some time later, Stephen was out\nof the room, Knight proceeded to pass the interval by looking at the\nsketches more carefully.\n\nThe first crude ideas, pertaining to dwellings of all kinds, were\nroughly outlined on the different pages. Antiquities had been copied;\nfragments of Indian columns, colossal statues, and outlandish ornament\nfrom the temples of Elephanta and Kenneri, were carelessly intruded\nupon by outlines of modern doors, windows, roofs, cooking-stoves, and\nhousehold furniture; everything, in short, which comes within the range\nof a practising architect’s experience, who travels with his eyes\nopen. Among these occasionally appeared rough delineations of mediaeval\nsubjects for carving or illumination--heads of Virgins, Saints, and\nProphets.\n\nStephen was not professedly a free-hand draughtsman, but he drew the\nhuman figure with correctness and skill. In its numerous repetitions on\nthe sides and edges of the leaves, Knight began to notice a peculiarity.\nAll the feminine saints had one type of feature. There were large nimbi\nand small nimbi about their drooping heads, but the face was always the\nsame. That profile--how well Knight knew that profile!\n\nHad there been but one specimen of the familiar countenance, he might\nhave passed over the resemblance as accidental; but a repetition meant\nmore. Knight thought anew of Smith’s hasty words earlier in the day, and\nlooked at the sketches again and again.\n\nOn the young man’s entry, Knight said with palpable agitation--\n\n‘Stephen, who are those intended for?’\n\nStephen looked over the book with utter unconcern, ‘Saints and angels,\ndone in my leisure moments. They were intended as designs for the\nstained glass of an English church.’\n\n‘But whom do you idealize by that type of woman you always adopt for the\nVirgin?’\n\n‘Nobody.’\n\nAnd then a thought raced along Stephen’s mind and he looked up at his\nfriend.\n\nThe truth is, Stephen’s introduction of Elfride’s lineaments had been so\nunconscious that he had not at first understood his companion’s drift.\nThe hand, like the tongue, easily acquires the trick of repetition by\nrote, without calling in the mind to assist at all; and this had been\nthe case here. Young men who cannot write verses about their Loves\ngenerally take to portraying them, and in the early days of his\nattachment Smith had never been weary of outlining Elfride. The\nlay-figure of Stephen’s sketches now initiated an adjustment of many\nthings. Knight had recognized her. The opportunity of comparing notes\nhad come unsought.\n\n‘Elfride Swancourt, to whom I was engaged,’ he said quietly.\n\n‘Stephen!’\n\n‘I know what you mean by speaking like that.’\n\n‘Was it Elfride? YOU the man, Stephen?’\n\n‘Yes; and you are thinking why did I conceal the fact from you that time\nat Endelstow, are you not?’\n\n‘Yes, and more--more.’\n\n‘I did it for the best; blame me if you will; I did it for the best. And\nnow say how could I be with you afterwards as I had been before?’\n\n‘I don’t know at all; I can’t say.’\n\nKnight remained fixed in thought, and once he murmured--\n\n‘I had a suspicion this afternoon that there might be some such meaning\nin your words about my taking her away. But I dismissed it. How came you\nto know her?’ he presently asked, in almost a peremptory tone.\n\n‘I went down about the church; years ago now.’\n\n‘When you were with Hewby, of course, of course. Well, I can’t\nunderstand it.’ His tones rose. ‘I don’t know what to say, your\nhoodwinking me like this for so long!’\n\n‘I don’t see that I have hoodwinked you at all.’\n\n‘Yes, yes, but’----\n\nKnight arose from his seat, and began pacing up and down the room. His\nface was markedly pale, and his voice perturbed, as he said--\n\n‘You did not act as I should have acted towards you under those\ncircumstances. I feel it deeply; and I tell you plainly, I shall never\nforget it!’\n\n‘What?’\n\n‘Your behaviour at that meeting in the family vault, when I told you\nwe were going to be married. Deception, dishonesty, everywhere; all the\nworld’s of a piece!’\n\nStephen did not much like this misconstruction of his motives, even\nthough it was but the hasty conclusion of a friend disturbed by emotion.\n\n‘I could do no otherwise than I did, with due regard to her,’ he said\nstiffly.\n\n‘Indeed!’ said Knight, in the bitterest tone of reproach. ‘Nor could\nyou with due regard to her have married her, I suppose! I have\nhoped--longed--that HE, who turns out to be YOU, would ultimately have\ndone that.’\n\n‘I am much obliged to you for that hope. But you talk very mysteriously.\nI think I had about the best reason anybody could have had for not doing\nthat.’\n\n‘Oh, what reason was it?’\n\n‘That I could not.’\n\n‘You ought to have made an opportunity; you ought to do so now, in bare\njustice to her, Stephen!’ cried Knight, carried beyond himself. ‘That\nyou know very well, and it hurts and wounds me more than you dream to\nfind you never have tried to make any reparation to a woman of that\nkind--so trusting, so apt to be run away with by her feelings--poor\nlittle fool, so much the worse for her!’\n\n‘Why, you talk like a madman! You took her away from me, did you not?’\n\n‘Picking up what another throws down can scarcely be called “taking\naway.” However, we shall not agree too well upon that subject, so we had\nbetter part.’\n\n‘But I am quite certain you misapprehend something most grievously,’\nsaid Stephen, shaken to the bottom of his heart. ‘What have I done; tell\nme? I have lost Elfride, but is that such a sin?’\n\n‘Was it her doing, or yours?’\n\n‘Was what?’\n\n‘That you parted.’\n\n‘I will tell you honestly. It was hers entirely, entirely.’\n\n‘What was her reason?’\n\n‘I can hardly say. But I’ll tell the story without reserve.’\n\nStephen until to-day had unhesitatingly held that she grew tired of him\nand turned to Knight; but he did not like to advance the statement now,\nor even to think the thought. To fancy otherwise accorded better with\nthe hope to which Knight’s estrangement had given birth: that love for\nhis friend was not the direct cause, but a result of her suspension of\nlove for himself.\n\n‘Such a matter must not be allowed to breed discord between us,’ Knight\nreturned, relapsing into a manner which concealed all his true feeling,\nas if confidence now was intolerable. ‘I do see that your reticence\ntowards me in the vault may have been dictated by prudential\nconsiderations.’ He concluded artificially, ‘It was a strange thing\naltogether; but not of much importance, I suppose, at this distance of\ntime; and it does not concern me now, though I don’t mind hearing your\nstory.’\n\nThese words from Knight, uttered with such an air of renunciation and\napparent indifference, prompted Smith to speak on--perhaps with a\nlittle complacency--of his old secret engagement to Elfride. He told\nthe details of its origin, and the peremptory words and actions of her\nfather to extinguish their love.\n\nKnight persevered in the tone and manner of a disinterested outsider.\nIt had become more than ever imperative to screen his emotions from\nStephen’s eye; the young man would otherwise be less frank, and their\nmeeting would be again embittered. What was the use of untoward candour?\n\nStephen had now arrived at the point in his ingenuous narrative where\nhe left the vicarage because of her father’s manner. Knight’s interest\nincreased. Their love seemed so innocent and childlike thus far.\n\n‘It is a nice point in casuistry,’ he observed, ‘to decide whether you\nwere culpable or not in not telling Swancourt that your friends were\nparishioners of his. It was only human nature to hold your tongue under\nthe circumstances. Well, what was the result of your dismissal by him?’\n\n‘That we agreed to be secretly faithful. And to insure this we thought\nwe would marry.’\n\nKnight’s suspense and agitation rose higher when Stephen entered upon\nthis phase of the subject.\n\n‘Do you mind telling on?’ he said, steadying his manner of speech.\n\n‘Oh, not at all.’\n\nThen Stephen gave in full the particulars of the meeting with Elfride at\nthe railway station; the necessity they were under of going to London,\nunless the ceremony were to be postponed. The long journey of the\nafternoon and evening; her timidity and revulsion of feeling; its\nculmination on reaching London; the crossing over to the down-platform\nand their immediate departure again, solely in obedience to her wish;\nthe journey all night; their anxious watching for the dawn; their\narrival at St. Launce’s at last--were detailed. And he told how a\nvillage woman named Jethway was the only person who recognized them,\neither going or coming; and how dreadfully this terrified Elfride. He\ntold how he waited in the fields whilst this then reproachful sweetheart\nwent for her pony, and how the last kiss he ever gave her was given a\nmile out of the town, on the way to Endelstow.\n\nThese things Stephen related with a will. He believed that in doing so\nhe established word by word the reasonableness of his claim to Elfride.\n\n‘Curse her! curse that woman!--that miserable letter that parted us! O\nGod!’\n\nKnight began pacing the room again, and uttered this at further end.\n\n‘What did you say?’ said Stephen, turning round.\n\n‘Say? Did I say anything? Oh, I was merely thinking about your story,\nand the oddness of my having a fancy for the same woman afterwards. And\nthat now I--I have forgotten her almost; and neither of us care about\nher, except just as a friend, you know, eh?’\n\nKnight still continued at the further end of the room, somewhat in\nshadow.\n\n‘Exactly,’ said Stephen, inwardly exultant, for he was really deceived\nby Knight’s off-hand manner.\n\nYet he was deceived less by the completeness of Knight’s disguise than\nby the persuasive power which lay in the fact that Knight had never\nbefore deceived him in anything. So this supposition that his companion\nhad ceased to love Elfride was an enormous lightening of the weight\nwhich had turned the scale against him.\n\n‘Admitting that Elfride COULD love another man after you,’ said the\nelder, under the same varnish of careless criticism, ‘she was none the\nworse for that experience.’\n\n‘The worse? Of course she was none the worse.’\n\n‘Did you ever think it a wild and thoughtless thing for her to do?’\n\n‘Indeed, I never did,’ said Stephen. ‘I persuaded her. She saw no harm\nin it until she decided to return, nor did I; nor was there, except to\nthe extent of indiscretion.’\n\n‘Directly she thought it was wrong she would go no further?’\n\n‘That was it. I had just begun to think it wrong too.’\n\n‘Such a childish escapade might have been misrepresented by any\nevil-disposed person, might it not?’\n\n‘It might; but I never heard that it was. Nobody who really knew all the\ncircumstances would have done otherwise than smile. If all the world had\nknown it, Elfride would still have remained the only one who thought her\naction a sin. Poor child, she always persisted in thinking so, and was\nfrightened more than enough.’\n\n‘Stephen, do you love her now?’\n\n‘Well, I like her; I always shall, you know,’ he said evasively, and\nwith all the strategy love suggested. ‘But I have not seen her for so\nlong that I can hardly be expected to love her. Do you love her still?’\n\n‘How shall I answer without being ashamed? What fickle beings we\nmen are, Stephen! Men may love strongest for a while, but women love\nlongest. I used to love her--in my way, you know.’\n\n‘Yes, I understand. Ah, and I used to love her in my way. In fact,\nI loved her a good deal at one time; but travel has a tendency to\nobliterate early fancies.’\n\n‘It has--it has, truly.’\n\nPerhaps the most extraordinary feature in this conversation was the\ncircumstance that, though each interlocutor had at first his suspicions\nof the other’s abiding passion awakened by several little acts, neither\nwould allow himself to see that his friend might now be speaking\ndeceitfully as well as he.\n\n‘Stephen.’ resumed Knight, ‘now that matters are smooth between us, I\nthink I must leave you. You won’t mind my hurrying off to my quarters?’\n\n‘You’ll stay to some sort of supper surely? didn’t you come to dinner!’\n\n‘You must really excuse me this once.’\n\n‘Then you’ll drop in to breakfast to-morrow.’\n\n‘I shall be rather pressed for time.’\n\n‘An early breakfast, which shall interfere with nothing?’\n\n‘I’ll come,’ said Knight, with as much readiness as it was possible to\ngraft upon a huge stock of reluctance. ‘Yes, early; eight o’clock say,\nas we are under the same roof.’\n\n‘Any time you like. Eight it shall be.’\n\nAnd Knight left him. To wear a mask, to dissemble his feelings as he\nhad in their late miserable conversation, was such torture that he could\nsupport it no longer. It was the first time in Knight’s life that he\nhad ever been so entirely the player of a part. And the man he had thus\ndeceived was Stephen, who had docilely looked up to him from youth as a\nsuperior of unblemished integrity.\n\nHe went to bed, and allowed the fever of his excitement to rage\nuncontrolled. Stephen--it was only he who was the rival--only Stephen!\nThere was an anti-climax of absurdity which Knight, wretched and\nconscience-stricken as he was, could not help recognizing. Stephen was\nbut a boy to him. Where the great grief lay was in perceiving that the\nvery innocence of Elfride in reading her little fault as one so grave\nwas what had fatally misled him. Had Elfride, with any degree of\ncoolness, asserted that she had done no harm, the poisonous breath of\nthe dead Mrs. Jethway would have been inoperative. Why did he not\nmake his little docile girl tell more? If on that subject he had only\nexercised the imperativeness customary with him on others, all might\nhave been revealed. It smote his heart like a switch when he remembered\nhow gently she had borne his scourging speeches, never answering him\nwith a single reproach, only assuring him of her unbounded love.\n\nKnight blessed Elfride for her sweetness, and forgot her fault. He\npictured with a vivid fancy those fair summer scenes with her. He\nagain saw her as at their first meeting, timid at speaking, yet in her\neagerness to be explanatory borne forward almost against her will.\nHow she would wait for him in green places, without showing any of the\nordinary womanly affectations of indifference! How proud she was to be\nseen walking with him, bearing legibly in her eyes the thought that he\nwas the greatest genius in the world!\n\nHe formed a resolution; and after that could make pretence of slumber no\nlonger. Rising and dressing himself, he sat down and waited for day.\n\nThat night Stephen was restless too. Not because of the unwontedness\nof a return to English scenery; not because he was about to meet his\nparents, and settle down for awhile to English cottage life. He was\nindulging in dreams, and for the nonce the warehouses of Bombay and the\nplains and forts of Poonah were but a shadow’s shadow. His dream was\nbased on this one atom of fact: Elfride and Knight had become separated,\nand their engagement was as if it had never been. Their rupture must\nhave occurred soon after Stephen’s discovery of the fact of their union;\nand, Stephen went on to think, what so probable as that a return of her\nerrant affection to himself was the cause?\n\nStephen’s opinions in this matter were those of a lover, and not the\nbalanced judgment of an unbiassed spectator. His naturally sanguine\nspirit built hope upon hope, till scarcely a doubt remained in his mind\nthat her lingering tenderness for him had in some way been perceived by\nKnight, and had provoked their parting.\n\nTo go and see Elfride was the suggestion of impulses it was impossible\nto withstand. At any rate, to run down from St. Launce’s to Castle\nPoterel, a distance of less than twenty miles, and glide like a ghost\nabout their old haunts, making stealthy inquiries about her, would be a\nfascinating way of passing the first spare hours after reaching home on\nthe day after the morrow.\n\nHe was now a richer man than heretofore, standing on his own bottom; and\nthe definite position in which he had rooted himself nullified old local\ndistinctions. He had become illustrious, even sanguine clarus, judging\nfrom the tone of the worthy Mayor of St. Launce’s.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIX\n\n     ‘Each to the loved one’s side.’\n\n\nThe friends and rivals breakfasted together the next morning. Not a word\nwas said on either side upon the matter discussed the previous evening\nso glibly and so hollowly. Stephen was absorbed the greater part of the\ntime in wishing he were not forced to stay in town yet another day.\n\n‘I don’t intend to leave for St. Launce’s till to-morrow, as you know,’\nhe said to Knight at the end of the meal. ‘What are you going to do with\nyourself to-day?’\n\n‘I have an engagement just before ten,’ said Knight deliberately; ‘and\nafter that time I must call upon two or three people.’\n\n‘I’ll look for you this evening,’ said Stephen.\n\n‘Yes, do. You may as well come and dine with me; that is, if we can\nmeet. I may not sleep in London to-night; in fact, I am absolutely\nunsettled as to my movements yet. However, the first thing I am going to\ndo is to get my baggage shifted from this place to Bede’s Inn. Good-bye\nfor the present. I’ll write, you know, if I can’t meet you.’\n\nIt now wanted a quarter to nine o’clock. When Knight was gone, Stephen\nfelt yet more impatient of the circumstance that another day would have\nto drag itself away wearily before he could set out for that spot of\nearth whereon a soft thought of him might perhaps be nourished still. On\na sudden he admitted to his mind the possibility that the engagement he\nwas waiting in town to keep might be postponed without much harm.\n\nIt was no sooner perceived than attempted. Looking at his watch, he\nfound it wanted forty minutes to the departure of the ten o’clock train\nfrom Paddington, which left him a surplus quarter of an hour before it\nwould be necessary to start for the station.\n\nScribbling a hasty note or two--one putting off the business meeting,\nanother to Knight apologizing for not being able to see him in the\nevening--paying his bill, and leaving his heavier luggage to follow\nhim by goods-train, he jumped into a cab and rattled off to the Great\nWestern Station.\n\nShortly afterwards he took his seat in the railway carriage.\n\nThe guard paused on his whistle, to let into the next compartment to\nSmith’s a man of whom Stephen had caught but a hasty glimpse as he ran\nacross the platform at the last moment.\n\nSmith sank back into the carriage, stilled by perplexity. The man was\nlike Knight--astonishingly like him. Was it possible it could be he?\nTo have got there he must have driven like the wind to Bede’s Inn, and\nhardly have alighted before starting again. No, it could not be he; that\nwas not his way of doing things.\n\nDuring the early part of the journey Stephen Smith’s thoughts busied\nthemselves till his brain seemed swollen. One subject was concerning\nhis own approaching actions. He was a day earlier than his letter to\nhis parents had stated, and his arrangement with them had been that\nthey should meet him at Plymouth; a plan which pleased the worthy couple\nbeyond expression. Once before the same engagement had been made, which\nhe had then quashed by ante-dating his arrival. This time he would go\nright on to Castle Boterel; ramble in that well-known neighbourhood\nduring the evening and next morning, making inquiries; and return to\nPlymouth to meet them as arranged--a contrivance which would leave their\ncherished project undisturbed, relieving his own impatience also.\n\nAt Chippenham there was a little waiting, and some loosening and\nattaching of carriages.\n\nStephen looked out. At the same moment another man’s head emerged from\nthe adjoining window. Each looked in the other’s face.\n\nKnight and Stephen confronted one another.\n\n‘You here!’ said the younger man.\n\n‘Yes. It seems that you are too,’ said Knight, strangely.\n\n‘Yes.’\n\nThe selfishness of love and the cruelty of jealousy were fairly\nexemplified at this moment. Each of the two men looked at his friend\nas he had never looked at him before. Each was TROUBLED at the other’s\npresence.\n\n‘I thought you said you were not coming till to-morrow,’ remarked\nKnight.\n\n‘I did. It was an afterthought to come to-day. This journey was your\nengagement, then?’\n\n‘No, it was not. This is an afterthought of mine too. I left a note to\nexplain it, and account for my not being able to meet you this evening\nas we arranged.’\n\n‘So did I for you.’\n\n‘You don’t look well: you did not this morning.’\n\n‘I have a headache. You are paler to-day than you were.’\n\n‘I, too, have been suffering from headache. We have to wait here a few\nminutes, I think.’\n\nThey walked up and down the platform, each one more and more\nembarrassingly concerned with the awkwardness of his friend’s\npresence. They reached the end of the footway, and paused in sheer\nabsent-mindedness. Stephen’s vacant eyes rested upon the operations of\nsome porters, who were shifting a dark and curious-looking van from the\nrear of the train, to shunt another which was between it and the fore\npart of the train. This operation having been concluded, the two friends\nreturned to the side of their carriage.\n\n‘Will you come in here?’ said Knight, not very warmly.\n\n‘I have my rug and portmanteau and umbrella with me: it is rather\nbothering to move now,’ said Stephen reluctantly. ‘Why not you come\nhere?’\n\n‘I have my traps too. It is hardly worth while to shift them, for I\nshall see you again, you know.’\n\n‘Oh, yes.’\n\nAnd each got into his own place. Just at starting, a man on the platform\nheld up his hands and stopped the train.\n\nStephen looked out to see what was the matter.\n\nOne of the officials was exclaiming to another, ‘That carriage should\nhave been attached again. Can’t you see it is for the main line? Quick!\nWhat fools there are in the world!’\n\n‘What a confounded nuisance these stoppages are!’ exclaimed Knight\nimpatiently, looking out from his compartment. ‘What is it?’\n\n‘That singular carriage we saw has been unfastened from our train by\nmistake, it seems,’ said Stephen.\n\nHe was watching the process of attaching it. The van or carriage, which\nhe now recognized as having seen at Paddington before they started, was\nrich and solemn rather than gloomy in aspect. It seemed to be quite\nnew, and of modern design, and its impressive personality attracted the\nnotice of others beside himself. He beheld it gradually wheeled forward\nby two men on each side: slower and more sadly it seemed to approach:\nthen a slight concussion, and they were connected with it, and off\nagain.\n\nStephen sat all the afternoon pondering upon the reason of Knight’s\nunexpected reappearance. Was he going as far as Castle Boterel? If so,\nhe could only have one object in view--a visit to Elfride. And what an\nidea it seemed!\n\nAt Plymouth Smith partook of a little refreshment, and then went round\nto the side from which the train started for Camelton, the new station\nnear Castle Boterel and Endelstow.\n\nKnight was already there.\n\nStephen walked up and stood beside him without speaking. Two men at this\nmoment crept out from among the wheels of the waiting train.\n\n‘The carriage is light enough,’ said one in a grim tone. ‘Light as\nvanity; full of nothing.’\n\n‘Nothing in size, but a good deal in signification,’ said the other, a\nman of brighter mind and manners.\n\nSmith then perceived that to their train was attached that same carriage\nof grand and dark aspect which had haunted them all the way from London.\n\n‘You are going on, I suppose?’ said Knight, turning to Stephen, after\nidly looking at the same object.\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘We may as well travel together for the remaining distance, may we not?’\n\n‘Certainly we will;’ and they both entered the same door.\n\nEvening drew on apace. It chanced to be the eve of St. Valentine’s--that\nbishop of blessed memory to youthful lovers--and the sun shone low under\nthe rim of a thick hard cloud, decorating the eminences of the landscape\nwith crowns of orange fire. As the train changed its direction on a\ncurve, the same rays stretched in through the window, and coaxed open\nKnight’s half-closed eyes.\n\n‘You will get out at St. Launce’s, I suppose?’ he murmured.\n\n‘No,’ said Stephen, ‘I am not expected till to-morrow.’ Knight was\nsilent.\n\n‘And you--are you going to Endelstow?’ said the younger man pointedly.\n\n‘Since you ask, I can do no less than say I am, Stephen,’ continued\nKnight slowly, and with more resolution of manner than he had shown all\nthe day. ‘I am going to Endelstow to see if Elfride Swancourt is still\nfree; and if so, to ask her to be my wife.’\n\n‘So am I,’ said Stephen Smith.\n\n‘I think you’ll lose your labour,’ Knight returned with decision.\n\n‘Naturally you do.’ There was a strong accent of bitterness in Stephen’s\nvoice. ‘You might have said HOPE instead of THINK,’ he added.\n\n‘I might have done no such thing. I gave you my opinion. Elfride\nSwancourt may have loved you once, no doubt, but it was when she was so\nyoung that she hardly knew her own mind.’\n\n‘Thank you,’ said Stephen laconically. ‘She knew her mind as well as I\ndid. We are the same age. If you hadn’t interfered----’\n\n‘Don’t say that--don’t say it, Stephen! How can you make out that I\ninterfered? Be just, please!’\n\n‘Well,’ said his friend, ‘she was mine before she was yours--you know\nthat! And it seemed a hard thing to find you had got her, and that if\nit had not been for you, all might have turned out well for me.’ Stephen\nspoke with a swelling heart, and looked out of the window to hide the\nemotion that would make itself visible upon his face.\n\n‘It is absurd,’ said Knight in a kinder tone, ‘for you to look at the\nmatter in that light. What I tell you is for your good. You naturally do\nnot like to realize the truth--that her liking for you was only a girl’s\nfirst fancy, which has no root ever.’\n\n‘It is not true!’ said Stephen passionately. ‘It was you put me out. And\nnow you’ll be pushing in again between us, and depriving me of my chance\nagain! My right, that’s what it is! How ungenerous of you to come\nanew and try to take her away from me! When you had won her, I did not\ninterfere; and you might, I think, Mr. Knight, do by me as I did by\nyou!’\n\n‘Don’t “Mr.” me; you are as well in the world as I am now.’\n\n‘First love is deepest; and that was mine.’\n\n‘Who told you that?’ said Knight superciliously.\n\n‘I had her first love. And it was through me that you and she parted. I\ncan guess that well enough.’\n\n‘It was. And if I were to explain to you in what way that operated in\nparting us, I should convince you that you do quite wrong in intruding\nupon her--that, as I said at first, your labour will be lost. I don’t\nchoose to explain, because the particulars are painful. But if you won’t\nlisten to me, go on, for Heaven’s sake. I don’t care what you do, my\nboy.’\n\n‘You have no right to domineer over me as you do. Just because, when\nI was a lad, I was accustomed to look up to you as a master, and you\nhelped me a little, for which I was grateful to you and have loved\nyou, you assume too much now, and step in before me. It is cruel--it is\nunjust--of you to injure me so!’\n\nKnight showed himself keenly hurt at this. ‘Stephen, those words are\nuntrue and unworthy of any man, and they are unworthy of you. You know\nyou wrong me. If you have ever profited by any instruction of mine, I am\nonly too glad to know it. You know it was given ungrudgingly, and that I\nhave never once looked upon it as making you in any way a debtor to me.’\n\nStephen’s naturally gentle nature was touched, and it was in a troubled\nvoice that he said, ‘Yes, yes. I am unjust in that--I own it.’\n\n‘This is St. Launce’s Station, I think. Are you going to get out?’\n\nKnight’s manner of returning to the matter in hand drew Stephen again\ninto himself. ‘No; I told you I was going to Endelstow,’ he resolutely\nreplied.\n\nKnight’s features became impassive, and he said no more. The train\ncontinued rattling on, and Stephen leant back in his corner and closed\nhis eyes. The yellows of evening had turned to browns, the dusky\nshades thickened, and a flying cloud of dust occasionally stroked the\nwindow--borne upon a chilling breeze which blew from the north-east.\nThe previously gilded but now dreary hills began to lose their daylight\naspects of rotundity, and to become black discs vandyked against the\nsky, all nature wearing the cloak that six o’clock casts over the\nlandscape at this time of the year.\n\nStephen started up in bewilderment after a long stillness, and it was\nsome time before he recollected himself.\n\n‘Well, how real, how real!’ he exclaimed, brushing his hand across his\neyes.\n\n‘What is?’ said Knight.\n\n‘That dream. I fell asleep for a few minutes, and have had a dream--the\nmost vivid I ever remember.’\n\nHe wearily looked out into the gloom. They were now drawing near to\nCamelton. The lighting of the lamps was perceptible through the veil of\nevening--each flame starting into existence at intervals, and blinking\nweakly against the gusts of wind.\n\n‘What did you dream?’ said Knight moodily.\n\n‘Oh, nothing to be told. ‘Twas a sort of incubus. There is never\nanything in dreams.’\n\n‘I hardly supposed there was.’\n\n‘I know that. However, what I so vividly dreamt was this, since you\nwould like to hear. It was the brightest of bright mornings at East\nEndelstow Church, and you and I stood by the font. Far away in the\nchancel Lord Luxellian was standing alone, cold and impassive, and\nutterly unlike his usual self: but I knew it was he. Inside the altar\nrail stood a strange clergyman with his book open. He looked up and said\nto Lord Luxellian, “Where’s the bride?” Lord Luxellian said, “There’s no\nbride.” At that moment somebody came in at the door, and I knew her to\nbe Lady Luxellian who died. He turned and said to her, “I thought you\nwere in the vault below us; but that could have only been a dream of\nmine. Come on.” Then she came on. And in brushing between us she chilled\nme so with cold that I exclaimed, “The life is gone out of me!” and, in\nthe way of dreams, I awoke. But here we are at Camelton.’\n\nThey were slowly entering the station.\n\n‘What are you going to do?’ said Knight. ‘Do you really intend to call\non the Swancourts?’\n\n‘By no means. I am going to make inquiries first. I shall stay at the\nLuxellian Arms to-night. You will go right on to Endelstow, I suppose,\nat once?’\n\n‘I can hardly do that at this time of the day. Perhaps you are not aware\nthat the family--her father, at any rate--is at variance with me as much\nas with you.\n\n‘I didn’t know it.’\n\n‘And that I cannot rush into the house as an old friend any more than\nyou can. Certainly I have the privileges of a distant relationship,\nwhatever they may be.’\n\nKnight let down the window, and looked ahead. ‘There are a great many\npeople at the station,’ he said. ‘They seem all to be on the look-out\nfor us.’\n\nWhen the train stopped, the half-estranged friends could perceive by the\nlamplight that the assemblage of idlers enclosed as a kernel a group of\nmen in black cloaks. A side gate in the platform railing was open,\nand outside this stood a dark vehicle, which they could not at first\ncharacterize. Then Knight saw on its upper part forms against the sky\nlike cedars by night, and knew the vehicle to be a hearse. Few people\nwere at the carriage doors to meet the passengers--the majority had\ncongregated at this upper end. Knight and Stephen alighted, and turned\nfor a moment in the same direction.\n\nThe sombre van, which had accompanied them all day from London, now\nbegan to reveal that their destination was also its own. It had been\ndrawn up exactly opposite the open gate. The bystanders all fell back,\nforming a clear lane from the gateway to the van, and the men in cloaks\nentered the latter conveyance.\n\n‘They are labourers, I fancy,’ said Stephen. ‘Ah, it is strange; but I\nrecognize three of them as Endelstow men. Rather remarkable this.’\n\nPresently they began to come out, two and two; and under the rays of\nthe lamp they were seen to bear between them a light-coloured coffin of\nsatin-wood, brightly polished, and without a nail. The eight men took\nthe burden upon their shoulders, and slowly crossed with it over to the\ngate.\n\nKnight and Stephen went outside, and came close to the procession as it\nmoved off. A carriage belonging to the cortege turned round close to\na lamp. The rays shone in upon the face of the vicar of Endelstow, Mr.\nSwancourt--looking many years older than when they had last seen him.\nKnight and Stephen involuntarily drew back.\n\nKnight spoke to a bystander. ‘What has Mr. Swancourt to do with that\nfuneral?’\n\n‘He is the lady’s father,’ said the bystander.\n\n‘What lady’s father?’ said Knight, in a voice so hollow that the man\nstared at him.\n\n‘The father of the lady in the coffin. She died in London, you know, and\nhas been brought here by this train. She is to be taken home to-night,\nand buried to-morrow.’\n\nKnight stood staring blindly at where the hearse had been; as if he saw\nit, or some one, there. Then he turned, and beheld the lithe form of\nStephen bowed down like that of an old man. He took his young friend’s\narm, and led him away from the light.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XL\n\n     ‘Welcome, proud lady.’\n\n\nHalf an hour has passed. Two miserable men are wandering in the darkness\nup the miles of road from Camelton to Endelstow.\n\n‘Has she broken her heart?’ said Henry Knight. ‘Can it be that I have\nkilled her? I was bitter with her, Stephen, and she has died! And may\nGod have NO mercy upon me!’\n\n‘How can you have killed her more than I?’\n\n‘Why, I went away from her--stole away almost--and didn’t tell her I\nshould not come again; and at that last meeting I did not kiss her once,\nbut let her miserably go. I have been a fool--a fool! I wish the most\nabject confession of it before crowds of my countrymen could in any way\nmake amends to my darling for the intense cruelty I have shown her!’\n\n‘YOUR darling!’ said Stephen, with a sort of laugh. ‘Any man can say\nthat, I suppose; any man can. I know this, she was MY darling before she\nwas yours; and after too. If anybody has a right to call her his own, it\nis I.’\n\n‘You talk like a man in the dark; which is what you are. Did she ever do\nanything for you? Risk her name, for instance, for you?’\n\nYes, she did,’ said Stephen emphatically.\n\n‘Not entirely. Did she ever live for you--prove she could not live\nwithout you--laugh and weep for you?’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘Never! Did she ever risk her life for you--no! My darling did for me.’\n\n‘Then it was in kindness only. When did she risk her life for you?’\n\n‘To save mine on the cliff yonder. The poor child was with me looking at\nthe approach of the Puffin steamboat, and I slipped down. We both had a\nnarrow escape. I wish we had died there!’\n\n‘Ah, but wait,’ Stephen pleaded with wet eyes. ‘She went on that cliff\nto see me arrive home: she had promised it. She told me she would months\nbefore. And would she have gone there if she had not cared for me at\nall?’\n\n‘You have an idea that Elfride died for you, no doubt,’ said Knight,\nwith a mournful sarcasm too nerveless to support itself.\n\n‘Never mind. If we find that--that she died yours, I’ll say no more\never.’\n\n‘And if we find she died yours, I’ll say no more.’\n\n‘Very well--so it shall be.’\n\nThe dark clouds into which the sun had sunk had begun to drop rain in an\nincreasing volume.\n\n‘Can we wait somewhere here till this shower is over?’ said Stephen\ndesultorily.\n\n‘As you will. But it is not worth while. We’ll hear the particulars, and\nreturn. Don’t let people know who we are. I am not much now.’\n\nThey had reached a point at which the road branched into two--just\noutside the west village, one fork of the diverging routes passing into\nthe latter place, the other stretching on to East Endelstow. Having come\nsome of the distance by the footpath, they now found that the hearse was\nonly a little in advance of them.\n\n‘I fancy it has turned off to East Endelstow. Can you see?’\n\n‘I cannot. You must be mistaken.’\n\nKnight and Stephen entered the village. A bar of fiery light lay across\nthe road, proceeding from the half-open door of a smithy, in which\nbellows were heard blowing and a hammer ringing. The rain had increased,\nand they mechanically turned for shelter towards the warm and cosy\nscene.\n\nClose at their heels came another man, without over-coat or umbrella,\nand with a parcel under his arm.\n\n‘A wet evening,’ he said to the two friends, and passed by them. They\nstood in the outer penthouse, but the man went in to the fire.\n\nThe smith ceased his blowing, and began talking to the man who had\nentered.\n\n‘I have walked all the way from Camelton,’ said the latter. ‘Was obliged\nto come to-night, you know.’\n\nHe held the parcel, which was a flat one, towards the firelight, to\nlearn if the rain had penetrated it. Resting it edgewise on the forge,\nhe supported it perpendicularly with one hand, wiping his face with the\nhandkerchief he held in the other.\n\n‘I suppose you know what I’ve got here?’ he observed to the smith.\n\n‘No, I don’t,’ said the smith, pausing again on his bellows.\n\n‘As the rain’s not over, I’ll show you,’ said the bearer.\n\nHe laid the thin and broad package, which had acute angles in different\ndirections, flat upon the anvil, and the smith blew up the fire to give\nhim more light. First, after untying the package, a sheet of brown paper\nwas removed: this was laid flat. Then he unfolded a piece of baize: this\nalso he spread flat on the paper. The third covering was a wrapper\nof tissue paper, which was spread out in its turn. The enclosure was\nrevealed, and he held it up for the smith’s inspection.\n\n‘Oh--I see!’ said the smith, kindling with a chastened interest, and\ndrawing close. ‘Poor young lady--ah, terrible melancholy thing--so soon\ntoo!’\n\nKnight and Stephen turned their heads and looked.\n\n‘And what’s that?’ continued the smith.\n\n‘That’s the coronet--beautifully finished, isn’t it? Ah, that cost some\nmoney!’\n\n‘’Tis as fine a bit of metal work as ever I see--that ‘tis.’\n\n‘It came from the same people as the coffin, you know, but was not ready\nsoon enough to be sent round to the house in London yesterday. I’ve got\nto fix it on this very night.’\n\nThe carefully-packed articles were a coffin-plate and coronet.\n\nKnight and Stephen came forward. The undertaker’s man, on seeing them\nlook for the inscription, civilly turned it round towards them, and each\nread, almost at one moment, by the ruddy light of the coals:\n\n\n           E L F R I D E,\n           Wife of Spenser Hugo Luxellian,\n           Fifteenth Baron Luxellian:\n           Died February 10, 18--.\n\n\nThey read it, and read it, and read it again--Stephen and Knight--as if\nanimated by one soul. Then Stephen put his hand upon Knight’s arm, and\nthey retired from the yellow glow, further, further, till the chill\ndarkness enclosed them round, and the quiet sky asserted its presence\noverhead as a dim grey sheet of blank monotony.\n\n‘Where shall we go?’ said Stephen.\n\n‘I don’t know.’\n\nA long silence ensued....’Elfride married!’ said Stephen then in a thin\nwhisper, as if he feared to let the assertion loose on the world.\n\n‘False,’ whispered Knight.\n\n‘And dead. Denied us both. I hate “false”--I hate it!’\n\nKnight made no answer.\n\nNothing was heard by them now save the slow measurement of time by their\nbeating pulses, the soft touch of the dribbling rain upon their clothes,\nand the low purr of the blacksmith’s bellows hard by.\n\n‘Shall we follow Elfie any further?’ Stephen said.\n\n‘No: let us leave her alone. She is beyond our love, and let her be\nbeyond our reproach. Since we don’t know half the reasons that made her\ndo as she did, Stephen, how can we say, even now, that she was not pure\nand true in heart?’ Knight’s voice had now become mild and gentle as a\nchild’s. He went on: ‘Can we call her ambitious? No. Circumstance has,\nas usual, overpowered her purposes--fragile and delicate as she--liable\nto be overthrown in a moment by the coarse elements of accident. I know\nthat’s it,--don’t you?’\n\n‘It may be--it must be. Let us go on.’\n\nThey began to bend their steps towards Castle Boterel, whither they\nhad sent their bags from Camelton. They wandered on in silence for many\nminutes. Stephen then paused, and lightly put his hand within Knight’s\narm.\n\n‘I wonder how she came to die,’ he said in a broken whisper. ‘Shall we\nreturn and learn a little more?’\n\nThey turned back again, and entering Endelstow a second time, came to a\ndoor which was standing open. It was that of an inn called the Welcome\nHome, and the house appeared to have been recently repaired and entirely\nmodernized. The name too was not that of the same landlord as formerly,\nbut Martin Cannister’s.\n\nKnight and Smith entered. The inn was quite silent, and they followed\nthe passage till they reached the kitchen, where a huge fire was\nburning, which roared up the chimney, and sent over the floor, ceiling,\nand newly-whitened walls a glare so intense as to make the candle quite\na secondary light. A woman in a white apron and black gown was standing\nthere alone behind a cleanly-scrubbed deal table. Stephen first, and\nKnight afterwards, recognized her as Unity, who had been parlour-maid at\nthe vicarage and young lady’s-maid at the Crags.\n\n‘Unity,’ said Stephen softly, ‘don’t you know me?’\n\nShe looked inquiringly a moment, and her face cleared up.\n\n‘Mr. Smith--ay, that it is!’ she said. ‘And that’s Mr. Knight. I beg you\nto sit down. Perhaps you know that since I saw you last I have married\nMartin Cannister.’\n\n‘How long have you been married?’\n\n‘About five months. We were married the same day that my dear Miss Elfie\nbecame Lady Luxellian.’ Tears appeared in Unity’s eyes, and filled them,\nand fell down her cheek, in spite of efforts to the contrary.\n\nThe pain of the two men in resolutely controlling themselves when thus\nexampled to admit relief of the same kind was distressing. They both\nturned their backs and walked a few steps away.\n\nThen Unity said, ‘Will you go into the parlour, gentlemen?’\n\n‘Let us stay here with her,’ Knight whispered, and turning said, ‘No; we\nwill sit here. We want to rest and dry ourselves here for a time, if you\nplease.’\n\nThat evening the sorrowing friends sat with their hostess beside the\nlarge fire, Knight in the recess formed by the chimney breast, where he\nwas in shade. And by showing a little confidence they won hers, and\nshe told them what they had stayed to hear--the latter history of poor\nElfride.\n\n‘One day--after you, Mr. Knight, left us for the last time--she was\nmissed from the Crags, and her father went after her, and brought her\nhome ill. Where she went to, I never knew--but she was very unwell for\nweeks afterwards. And she said to me that she didn’t care what became of\nher, and she wished she could die. When she was better, I said she would\nlive to be married yet, and she said then, “Yes; I’ll do anything\nfor the benefit of my family, so as to turn my useless life to some\npractical account.” Well, it began like this about Lord Luxellian\ncourting her. The first Lady Luxellian had died, and he was in great\ntrouble because the little girls were left motherless. After a while\nthey used to come and see her in their little black frocks, for they\nliked her as well or better than their own mother---that’s true.\nThey used to call her “little mamma.” These children made her a shade\nlivelier, but she was not the girl she had been--I could see that--and\nshe grew thinner a good deal. Well, my lord got to ask the Swancourts\noftener and oftener to dinner--nobody else of his acquaintance--and at\nlast the vicar’s family were backwards and forwards at all hours of the\nday. Well, people say that the little girls asked their father to let\nMiss Elfride come and live with them, and that he said perhaps he would\nif they were good children. However, the time went on, and one day I\nsaid, “Miss Elfride, you don’t look so well as you used to; and though\nnobody else seems to notice it I do.” She laughed a little, and said, “I\nshall live to be married yet, as you told me.”\n\n‘“Shall you, miss? I am glad to hear that,” I said.\n\n‘“Whom do you think I am going to be married to?” she said again.\n\n‘“Mr. Knight, I suppose,” said I.\n\n‘“Oh!” she cried, and turned off so white, and afore I could get to her\nshe had sunk down like a heap of clothes, and fainted away. Well, then,\nshe came to herself after a time, and said, “Unity, now we’ll go on with\nour conversation.”\n\n‘“Better not to-day, miss,” I said.\n\n‘“Yes, we will,” she said. “Whom do you think I am going to be married\nto?”\n\n‘“I don’t know,” I said this time.\n\n‘“Guess,” she said.\n\n‘“‘Tisn’t my lord, is it?” says I.\n\n‘“Yes, ‘tis,” says she, in a sick wild way.\n\n‘“But he don’t come courting much,” I said.\n\n“‘Ah! you don’t know,” she said, and told me ‘twas going to be in\nOctober. After that she freshened up a bit--whether ‘twas with the\nthought of getting away from home or not, I don’t know. For, perhaps, I\nmay as well speak plainly, and tell you that her home was no home to her\nnow. Her father was bitter to her and harsh upon her; and though Mrs.\nSwancourt was well enough in her way, ‘twas a sort of cold politeness\nthat was not worth much, and the little thing had a worrying time of it\naltogether. About a month before the wedding, she and my lord and the\ntwo children used to ride about together upon horseback, and a very\npretty sight they were; and if you’ll believe me, I never saw him once\nwith her unless the children were with her too--which made the courting\nso strange-looking. Ay, and my lord is so handsome, you know, so that at\nlast I think she rather liked him; and I have seen her smile and blush a\nbit at things he said. He wanted her the more because the children did,\nfor everybody could see that she would be a most tender mother to them,\nand friend and playmate too. And my lord is not only handsome, but\na splendid courter, and up to all the ways o’t. So he made her the\nbeautifullest presents; ah, one I can mind--a lovely bracelet, with\ndiamonds and emeralds. Oh, how red her face came when she saw it! The\nold roses came back to her cheeks for a minute or two then. I helped\ndress her the day we both were married--it was the last service I did\nher, poor child! When she was ready, I ran upstairs and slipped on my\nown wedding gown, and away they went, and away went Martin and I; and no\nsooner had my lord and my lady been married than the parson married us.\nIt was a very quiet pair of weddings--hardly anybody knew it. Well,\nhope will hold its own in a young heart, if so be it can; and my lady\nfreshened up a bit, for my lord was SO handsome and kind.’\n\n‘How came she to die--and away from home?’ murmured Knight.\n\n‘Don’t you see, sir, she fell off again afore they’d been married long,\nand my lord took her abroad for change of scene. They were coming home,\nand had got as far as London, when she was taken very ill and couldn’t\nbe moved, and there she died.’\n\n‘Was he very fond of her?’\n\n‘What, my lord? Oh, he was!’\n\n‘VERY fond of her?’\n\n‘VERY, beyond everything. Not suddenly, but by slow degrees. ‘Twas her\nnature to win people more when they knew her well. He’d have died for\nher, I believe. Poor my lord, he’s heart-broken now!’\n\n‘The funeral is to-morrow?’\n\n‘Yes; my husband is now at the vault with the masons, opening the steps\nand cleaning down the walls.’\n\n\nThe next day two men walked up the familiar valley from Castle Boterel\nto East Endelstow Church. And when the funeral was over, and every one\nhad left the lawn-like churchyard, the pair went softly down the steps\nof the Luxellian vault, and under the low-groined arches they had beheld\nonce before, lit up then as now. In the new niche of the crypt lay a\nrather new coffin, which had lost some of its lustre, and a newer coffin\nstill, bright and untarnished in the slightest degree.\n\nBeside the latter was the dark form of a man, kneeling on the damp\nfloor, his body flung across the coffin, his hands clasped, and his\nwhole frame seemingly given up in utter abandonment to grief. He was\nstill young--younger, perhaps, than Knight--and even now showed how\ngraceful was his figure and symmetrical his build. He murmured a prayer\nhalf aloud, and was quite unconscious that two others were standing\nwithin a few yards of him.\n\nKnight and Stephen had advanced to where they once stood beside Elfride\non the day all three had met there, before she had herself gone down\ninto silence like her ancestors, and shut her bright blue eyes for ever.\nNot until then did they see the kneeling figure in the dim light. Knight\ninstantly recognized the mourner as Lord Luxellian, the bereaved husband\nof Elfride.\n\nThey felt themselves to be intruders. Knight pressed Stephen back, and\nthey silently withdrew as they had entered.\n\n‘Come away,’ he said, in a broken voice. ‘We have no right to be there.\nAnother stands before us--nearer to her than we!’\n\nAnd side by side they both retraced their steps down the grey still\nvalley to Castle Boterel."
