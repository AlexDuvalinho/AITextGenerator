 "text": "THE DAMNATION OF THERON WARE\n\n\nby Harold Frederic\n\n\n\n\nPART I\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nNo such throng had ever before been seen in the building during all its\neight years of existence. People were wedged together most uncomfortably\nupon the seats; they stood packed in the aisles and overflowed the\ngalleries; at the back, in the shadows underneath these galleries, they\nformed broad, dense masses about the doors, through which it would be\nhopeless to attempt a passage.\n\nThe light, given out from numerous tin-lined circles of flaring gas-jets\narranged on the ceiling, fell full upon a thousand uplifted faces--some\nframed in bonnets or juvenile curls, others bearded or crowned with\nshining baldness--but all alike under the spell of a dominant emotion\nwhich held features in abstracted suspense and focussed every eye upon a\ncommon objective point.\n\nThe excitement of expectancy reigned upon each row of countenances, was\nvisible in every attitude--nay, seemed a part of the close, overheated\natmosphere itself.\n\nAn observer, looking over these compact lines of faces and noting the\nuniform concentration of eagerness they exhibited, might have guessed\nthat they were watching for either the jury's verdict in some peculiarly\nabsorbing criminal trial, or the announcement of the lucky numbers in\na great lottery. These two expressions seemed to alternate, and even to\nmingle vaguely, upon the upturned lineaments of the waiting throng--the\nhope of some unnamed stroke of fortune and the dread of some adverse\ndecree.\n\nBut a glance forward at the object of this universal gaze would have\nsufficed to shatter both hypotheses. Here was neither a court of justice\nnor a tombola. It was instead the closing session of the annual Nedahma\nConference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and the Bishop was about\nto read out the list of ministerial appointments for the coming year.\nThis list was evidently written in a hand strange to him, and the slow,\nnear-sighted old gentleman, having at last sufficiently rubbed the\nglasses of his spectacles, and then adjusted them over his nose\nwith annoying deliberation, was now silently rehearsing his task to\nhimself--the while the clergymen round about ground their teeth and\nrestlessly shuffled their feet in impatience.\n\nUpon a closer inspection of the assemblage, there were a great many\nof these clergymen. A dozen or more dignified, and for the most part\nelderly, brethren sat grouped about the Bishop in the pulpit. As many\nothers, not quite so staid in mien, and indeed with here and there\nalmost a suggestion of frivolity in their postures, were seated on the\nsteps leading down from this platform. A score of their fellows sat\nfacing the audience, on chairs tightly wedged into the space railed off\nround the pulpit; and then came five or six rows of pews, stretching\nacross the whole breadth of the church, and almost solidly filled with\npreachers of the Word.\n\nThere were very old men among these--bent and decrepit veterans who\nhad known Lorenzo Dow, and had been ordained by elders who remembered\nFrancis Asbury and even Whitefield. They sat now in front places,\nleaning forward with trembling and misshapen hands behind their hairy\nears, waiting to hear their names read out on the superannuated list, it\nmight be for the last time.\n\nThe sight of these venerable Fathers in Israel was good to the eyes,\nconjuring up, as it did, pictures of a time when a plain and homely\npeople had been served by a fervent and devoted clergy--by preachers\nwho lacked in learning and polish, no doubt, but who gave their lives\nwithout dream of earthly reward to poverty and to the danger and wearing\ntoil of itinerant missions through the rude frontier settlements. These\npictures had for their primitive accessories log-huts, rough household\nimplements, coarse clothes, and patched old saddles which told of weary\nyears of journeying; but to even the least sympathetic vision there\nshone upon them the glorified light of the Cross and Crown. Reverend\nsurvivors of the heroic times, their very presence there--sitting\nmeekly at the altar-rail to hear again the published record of their\nuselessness and of their dependence upon church charity--was in the\nnature of a benediction.\n\nThe large majority of those surrounding these patriarchs were\nmiddle-aged men, generally of a robust type, with burly shoulders, and\nbushing beards framing shaven upper lips, and who looked for the most\npart like honest and prosperous farmers attired in their Sunday clothes.\nAs exceptions to this rule, there were scattered stray specimens of\na more urban class, worthies with neatly trimmed whiskers, white\nneckcloths, and even indications of hair-oil--all eloquent of citified\ncharges; and now and again the eye singled out a striking and scholarly\nface, at once strong and simple, and instinctively referred it to the\nfaculty of one of the several theological seminaries belonging to the\nConference.\n\nThe effect of these faces as a whole was toward goodness, candor,\nand imperturbable self-complacency rather than learning or mental\nastuteness; and curiously enough it wore its pleasantest aspect on\nthe countenances of the older men. The impress of zeal and moral worth\nseemed to diminish by regular gradations as one passed to younger faces;\nand among the very beginners, who had been ordained only within the past\nday or two, this decline was peculiarly marked. It was almost a relief\nto note the relative smallness of their number, so plainly was it to be\nseen that they were not the men their forbears had been.\n\nAnd if those aged, worn-out preachers facing the pulpit had gazed\ninstead backward over the congregation, it may be that here too their\nold eyes would have detected a difference--what at least they would have\ndeemed a decline.\n\nBut nothing was further from the minds of the members of the First M. E.\nChurch of Tecumseh than the suggestion that they were not an improvement\non those who had gone before them. They were undoubtedly the smartest\nand most important congregation within the limits of the Nedahma\nConference, and this new church edifice of theirs represented alike\na scale of outlay and a standard of progressive taste in devotional\narchitecture unique in the Methodism of that whole section of the State.\nThey had a right to be proud of themselves, too. They belonged to the\nsubstantial order of the community, with perhaps not so many very rich\nmen as the Presbyterians had, but on the other hand with far fewer\nextremely poor folk than the Baptists were encumbered with. The pews\nin the first four rows of their church rented for one hundred dollars\napiece--quite up to the Presbyterian highwater mark--and they now had\nalmost abolished free pews altogether. The oyster suppers given by their\nLadies' Aid Society in the basement of the church during the winter\nhad established rank among the fashionable events in Tecumseh's social\ncalendar.\n\nA comprehensive and satisfied perception of these advantages was\nuppermost in the minds of this local audience, as they waited for the\nBishop to begin his reading. They had entertained this Bishop and his\nPresiding Elders, and the rank and file of common preachers, in a style\nwhich could not have been remotely approached by any other congregation\nin the Conference. Where else, one would like to know, could the\nBishop have been domiciled in a Methodist house where he might have a\nsitting-room all to himself, with his bedroom leading out of it? Every\nclergyman present had been provided for in a private residence--even\ndown to the Licensed Exhorters, who were not really ministers at all\nwhen you came to think of it, and who might well thank their stars\nthat the Conference had assembled among such open-handed people. There\nexisted a dim feeling that these Licensed Exhorters--an uncouth crew,\nwith country store-keepers and lumbermen and even a horse-doctor among\ntheir number--had taken rather too much for granted, and were not\nexhibiting quite the proper degree of gratitude over their reception.\n\nBut a more important issue hung now imminent in the balance--was\nTecumseh to be fairly and honorably rewarded for her hospitality by\nbeing given the pastor of her choice?\n\nAll were agreed--at least among those who paid pew-rents--upon the great\nimportance of a change in the pulpit of the First M. E. Church. A change\nin persons must of course take place, for their present pastor had\nexhausted the three-year maximum of the itinerant system, but there was\nneeded much more than that. For a handsome and expensive church building\nlike this, and with such a modern and go-ahead congregation, it was\nsimply a vital necessity to secure an attractive and fashionable\npreacher. They had held their own against the Presbyterians these past\nfew years only by the most strenuous efforts, and under the depressing\ndisadvantage of a minister who preached dreary out-of-date sermons, and\nwho lacked even the most rudimentary sense of social distinctions. The\nPresbyterians had captured the new cashier of the Adams County Bank, who\nhad always gone to the Methodist Church in the town he came from, but\nnow was lost solely because of this tiresome old fossil of theirs; and\nthere were numerous other instances of the same sort, scarcely less\ngrievous. That this state of things must be altered was clear.\n\nThe unusually large local attendance upon the sessions of the Conference\nhad given some of the more guileless of visiting brethren a high notion\nof Tecumseh's piety; and perhaps even the most sophisticated stranger\nnever quite realized how strictly it was to be explained by the anxiety\nto pick out a suitable champion for the fierce Presbyterian competition.\nBig gatherings assembled evening after evening to hear the sermons of\nthose selected to preach, and the church had been almost impossibly\ncrowded at each of the three Sunday services. Opinions had naturally\ndiffered a good deal during the earlier stages of this scrutiny, but\nafter last night's sermon there could be but one feeling. The man for\nTecumseh was the Reverend Theron Ware.\n\nThe choice was an admirable one, from points of view much more exalted\nthan those of the local congregation.\n\nYou could see Mr. Ware sitting there at the end of the row inside the\naltar-rail--the tall, slender young man with the broad white brow,\nthoughtful eyes, and features moulded into that regularity of strength\nwhich used to characterize the American Senatorial type in those\nfar-away days of clean-shaven faces and moderate incomes before the War.\nThe bright-faced, comely, and vivacious young woman in the second side\npew was his wife--and Tecumseh noted with approbation that she knew\nhow to dress. There were really no two better or worthier people in the\nbuilding than this young couple, who sat waiting along with the rest to\nhear their fate. But unhappily they had come to know of the effort being\nmade to bring them to Tecumseh; and their simple pride in the triumph of\nthe husband's fine sermon had become swallowed up in a terribly anxious\nconflict of hope and fear. Neither of them could maintain a satisfactory\nshow of composure as the decisive moment approached. The vision of\ntranslation from poverty and obscurity to such a splendid post as\nthis--truly it was too dazzling for tranquil nerves.\n\nThe tedious Bishop had at last begun to call his roll of names, and the\ngood people of Tecumseh mentally ticked them off, one by one, as the\nlist expanded. They felt that it was like this Bishop--an unimportant\nand commonplace figure in Methodism, not to be mentioned in the same\nbreath with Simpson and Janes and Kingsley--that he should begin with\nthe backwoods counties, and thrust all these remote and pitifully rustic\nstations ahead of their own metropolitan charge. To these they listened\nbut listlessly--indifferent alike to the joy and to the dismay which he\nwas scattering among the divines before him.\n\nThe announcements were being doled out with stumbling hesitation. After\neach one a little half-rustling movement through the crowded rows of\nclergymen passed mute judgment upon the cruel blow this brother had\nreceived, the reward justly given to this other, the favoritism by which\na third had profited. The Presiding Elders, whose work all this was,\nstared with gloomy and impersonal abstraction down upon the rows of\nblackcoated humanity spread before them. The ministers returned this\nfixed and perfunctory gaze with pale, set faces, only feebly masking the\nemotions which each new name stirred somewhere among them. The Bishop\ndroned on laboriously, mispronouncing words and repeating himself as if\nhe were reading a catalogue of unfamiliar seeds.\n\n“First church of Tecumseh--Brother Abram G. Tisdale!”\n\nThere was no doubt about it! These were actually the words that had been\nuttered. After all this outlay, all this lavish hospitality, all this\nsacrifice of time and patience in sitting through those sermons, to draw\nfrom the grab-bag nothing better than--a Tisdale!\n\nA hum of outraged astonishment--half groan, half wrathful snort bounded\nalong from pew to pew throughout the body of the church. An echo of it\nreached the Bishop, and so confused him that he haltingly repeated the\nobnoxious line. Every local eye turned as by intuition to where the\ncalamitous Tisdale sat, and fastened malignantly upon him.\n\nCould anything be worse? This Brother Tisdale was past fifty--a\nspindling, rickety, gaunt old man, with a long horse-like head and\nvacantly solemn face, who kept one or the other of his hands continually\nfumbling his bony jaw. He had been withdrawn from routine service for a\nnumber of years, doing a little insurance canvassing on his own account,\nand also travelling for the Book Concern. Now that he wished to return\nto parochial work, the richest prize in the whole list, Tecumseh, was\ngiven to him--to him who had never been asked to preach at a Conference,\nand whose archaic nasal singing of “Greenland's Icy Mountains” had made\neven the Licensed Exhorters grin! It was too intolerably dreadful to\nthink of!\n\nAn embittered whisper to the effect that Tisdale was the Bishop's cousin\nran round from pew to pew. This did not happen to be true, but indignant\nTecumseh gave it entire credit. The throngs about the doors dwindled as\nby magic, and the aisles cleared. Local interest was dead; and even some\nof the pewholders rose and made their way out. One of these murmured\naudibly to his neighbors as he departed that HIS pew could be had now\nfor sixty dollars.\n\nSo it happened that when, a little later on, the appointment of Theron\nWare to Octavius was read out, none of the people of Tecumseh either\nnoted or cared. They had been deeply interested in him so long as\nit seemed likely that he was to come to them--before their clearly\nexpressed desire for him had been so monstrously ignored. But now what\nbecame of him was no earthly concern of theirs.\n\nAfter the Doxology had been sung and the Conference formally declared\nended, the Wares would fain have escaped from the flood of handshakings\nand boisterous farewells which spread over the front part of the church.\nBut the clergymen were unusually insistent upon demonstrations of\ncordiality among themselves--the more, perhaps, because it was evident\nthat the friendliness of their local hosts had suddenly evaporated--and,\nof all men in the world, the present incumbent of the Octavius pulpit\nnow bore down upon them with noisy effusiveness, and defied evasion.\n\n“Brother Ware--we have never been interduced--but let me clasp your\nhand! And--Sister Ware, I presume--yours too!”\n\nHe was a portly man, who held his head back so that his face seemed all\njowl and mouth and sandy chin-whisker. He smiled broadly upon them with\nhalf-closed eyes, and shook hands again.\n\n“I said to 'em,” he went on with loud pretence of heartiness, “the\nminute I heerd your name called out for our dear Octavius, 'I must go\nover an' interduce myself.' It will be a heavy cross to part with those\ndear people, Brother Ware, but if anything could wean me to the notion,\nso to speak, it would be the knowledge that you are to take up my labors\nin their midst. Perhaps--ah--perhaps they ARE jest a trifle close in\nmoney matters, but they come out strong on revivals. They'll need a good\ndeal o' stirrin' up about parsonage expenses, but, oh! such seasons\nof grace as we've experienced there together!” He shook his head, and\nclosed his eyes altogether, as if transported by his memories.\n\nBrother Ware smiled faintly in decorous response, and bowed in silence;\nbut his wife resented the unctuous beaming of content on the other's\nwide countenance, and could not restrain her tongue.\n\n“You seem to bear up tolerably well under this heavy cross, as you call\nit,” she said sharply.\n\n“The will o' the Lord, Sister Ware--the will o' the Lord!” he responded,\ndisposed for the instant to put on his pompous manner with her, and then\ndeciding to smile again as he moved off. The circumstance that he was to\nget an additional three hundred dollars yearly in his new place was not\nmentioned between them.\n\nBy a mutual impulse the young couple, when they had at last gained the\ncool open air, crossed the street to the side where over-hanging trees\nshaded the infrequent lamps, and they might be comparatively alone. The\nwife had taken her husband's arm, and pressed closely upon it as they\nwalked. For a time no word passed, but finally he said, in a grave\nvoice,--\n\n“It is hard upon you, poor girl.”\n\nThen she stopped short, buried her face against his shoulder, and fell\nto sobbing.\n\nHe strove with gentle, whispered remonstrance to win her from this mood,\nand after a few moments she lifted her head and they resumed their walk,\nshe wiping her eyes as they went.\n\n“I couldn't keep it in a minute longer!” she said, catching her breath\nbetween phrases. “Oh, WHY do they behave so badly to us, Theron?”\n\nHe smiled down momentarily upon her as they moved along, and patted her\nhand.\n\n“Somebody must have the poor places, Alice,” he said consolingly. “I am\na young man yet, remember. We must take our turn, and be patient. For\n'we know that all things work together for good.'”\n\n“And your sermon was so head-and-shoulders above all the others!” she\nwent on breathlessly. “Everybody said so! And Mrs. Parshall heard it so\nDIRECT that you were to be sent here, and I know she told everybody how\nmuch I was lotting on it--I wish we could go right off tonight without\ngoing to her house--I shall be ashamed to look her in the face--and\nof course she knows we're poked off to that miserable Octavius.--Why,\nTheron, they tell me it's a worse place even than we've got now!”\n\n“Oh, not at all,” he put in reassuringly. “It has grown to be a large\ntown--oh, quite twice the size of Tyre. It's a great Irish place, I've\nheard. Our own church seems to be a good deal run down there. We must\nbuild it up again; and the salary is better--a little.”\n\nBut he too was depressed, and they walked on toward their temporary\nlodging in a silence full of mutual grief. It was not until they had\ncome within sight of this goal that he prefaced by a little sigh of\nresignation these further words,--\n\n“Come--let us make the best of it, my girl! After all, we are in the\nhands of the Lord.”\n\n“Oh, don't, Theron!” she said hastily. “Don't talk to me about the Lord\ntonight; I can't bear it!”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\n“Theron! Come out here! This is the funniest thing we have heard yet!”\n\nMrs. Ware stood on the platform of her new kitchen stoop. The bright\nflood of May-morning sunshine completely enveloped her girlish form,\nclad in a simple, fresh-starched calico gown, and shone in golden\npatches upon her light-brown hair. She had a smile on her face, as she\nlooked down at the milk boy standing on the bottom step--a smile of a\ndoubtful sort, stormily mirthful.\n\n“Come out a minute, Theron!” she called again; and in obedience to the\nsummons the tall lank figure of her husband appeared in the open doorway\nbehind her. A long loose, open dressing-gown dangled to his knees,\nand his sallow, clean-shaven, thoughtful face wore a morning undress\nexpression of youthful good-nature. He leaned against the door-sill,\ncrossed his large carpet slippers, and looked up into the sky, drawing a\nlong satisfied breath.\n\n“What a beautiful morning!” he exclaimed. “The elms over there are full\nof robins. We must get up earlier these mornings, and take some walks.”\n\nHis wife indicated the boy with the milk-pail on his arm, by a wave of\nher hand.\n\n“Guess what he tells me!” she said. “It wasn't a mistake at all, our\ngetting no milk yesterday or the Sunday before. It seems that that's the\ncustom here, at least so far as the parsonage is concerned.”\n\n“What's the matter, boy?” asked the young minister, drawling his words\na little, and putting a sense of placid irony into them. “Don't the cows\ngive milk on Sunday, then?”\n\nThe boy was not going to be chaffed. “Oh, I'll bring you milk fast\nenough on Sundays, if you give me the word,” he said with nonchalance.\n“Only it won't last long.”\n\n“How do you mean--'won't last long'?”, asked Mrs. Ware, briskly.\n\nThe boy liked her--both for herself, and for the doughnuts fried with\nher own hands, which she gave him on his morning round. He dropped his\nhalf-defiant tone.\n\n“The thing of it's this,” he explained. “Every new minister starts in\nsaying we can deliver to this house on Sundays, an' then gives us notice\nto stop before the month's out. It's the trustees that does it.”\n\nThe Rev. Theron Ware uncrossed his feet and moved out on to the stoop\nbeside his wife. “What's that you say?” he interjected. “Don't THEY take\nmilk on Sundays?”\n\n“Nope!” answered the boy.\n\nThe young couple looked each other in the face for a puzzled moment,\nthen broke into a laugh.\n\n“Well, we'll try it, anyway,” said the preacher. “You can go on bringing\nit Sundays till--till--”\n\n“Till you cave in an' tell me to stop,” put in the boy. “All right!” and\nhe was off on the instant, the dipper jangling loud incredulity in his\npail as he went.\n\nThe Wares exchanged another glance as he disappeared round the corner\nof the house, and another mutual laugh seemed imminent. Then the wife's\nface clouded over, and she thrust her under-lip a trifle forward out of\nits place in the straight and gently firm profile.\n\n“It's just what Wendell Phillips said,” she declared. “'The Puritan's\nidea of hell is a place where everybody has to mind his own business.'”\n\nThe young minister stroked his chin thoughtfully, and let his gaze\nwander over the backyard in silence. The garden parts had not been\nspaded up, but lay, a useless stretch of muddy earth, broken only by\nlast year's cabbage-stumps and the general litter of dead roots and\nvegetation. The door of the tenantless chicken-coop hung wide open.\nBefore it was a great heap of ashes and cinders, soaked into grimy\nhardness by the recent spring rains, and nearer still an ancient\nchopping-block, round which were scattered old weather-beaten\nhardwood knots which had defied the axe, parts of broken barrels and\npacking-boxes, and a nameless debris of tin cans, clam-shells, and\ngeneral rubbish. It was pleasanter to lift the eyes, and look across the\nneighbors' fences to the green, waving tops of the elms on the street\nbeyond. How lofty and beautiful they were in the morning sunlight, and\nwith what matchless charm came the song of the robins, freshly installed\nin their haunts among the new pale-green leaves! Above them, in the\nfresh, scented air, glowed the great blue dome, radiant with light and\nthe purification of spring.\n\nTheron lifted his thin, long-fingered hand, and passed it in a slow arch\nof movement to comprehend this glorious upper picture.\n\n“What matter anyone's ideas of hell,” he said, in soft, grave tones,\n“when we have that to look at, and listen to, and fill our lungs with?\nIt seems to me that we never FEEL quite so sure of God's goodness at\nother times as we do in these wonderful new mornings of spring.”\n\nThe wife followed his gesture, and her eyes rested for a brief moment,\nwith pleased interest, upon the trees and the sky. Then they reverted,\nwith a harsher scrutiny, to the immediate foreground.\n\n“Those Van Sizers ought to be downright ashamed of themselves,” she\nsaid, “to leave everything in such a muss as this. You MUST see about\ngetting a man to clean up the yard, Theron. It's no use your thinking of\ndoing it yourself. In the first place, it wouldn't look quite the thing,\nand, second, you'd never get at it in all your born days. Or if a man\nwould cost too much, we might get a boy. I daresay Harvey would come\naround, after he'd finished with his milk-route in the forenoon. We\ncould give him his dinner, you know, and I'd bake him some cookies. He's\ngot the greatest sweet-tooth you ever heard of. And then perhaps if we\ngave him a quarter, or say half a dollar, he'd be quite satisfied. I'll\nspeak to him in the morning. We can save a dollar or so that way.”\n\n“I suppose every little does help,” commented Mr. Ware, with a doleful\nlack of conviction. Then his face brightened. “I tell you what let's\ndo!” he exclaimed. “Get on your street dress, and we'll take a long\nwalk, way out into the country. You've never seen the basin, where they\nfloat the log-rafts in, or the big sawmills. The hills beyond give\nyou almost mountain effects, they are so steep; and they say there's a\nsulphur spring among the slate on the hill-side, somewhere, with trees\nall about it; and we could take some sandwiches with us--”\n\n“You forget,” put in Mrs. Ware,--“those trustees are coming at eleven.”\n\n“So they are!” assented the young minister, with something like a sigh.\nHe cast another reluctant, lingering glance at the sunlit elm boughs,\nand, turning, went indoors.\n\nHe loitered for an aimless minute in the kitchen, where his wife, her\nsleeves rolled to the elbow, now resumed the interrupted washing of the\nbreakfast dishes--perhaps with vague visions of that ever-receding\ntime to come when they might have a hired girl to do such work. Then\nhe wandered off into the room beyond, which served them alike as\nliving-room and study, and let his eye run along the two rows of books\nthat constituted his library. He saw nothing which he wanted to read.\nFinally he did take down “Paley's Evidences,” and seated himself in\nthe big armchair--that costly and oversized anomaly among his humble\nhouse-hold gods; but the book lay unopened on his knee, and his eyelids\nhalf closed themselves in sign of revery.\n\nThis was his third charge--this Octavius which they both knew they were\ngoing to dislike so much.\n\nThe first had been in the pleasant dairy and hop country many miles to\nthe south, on another watershed and among a different kind of people.\nPerhaps, in truth, the grinding labor, the poverty of ideas, the\nsystematic selfishness of later rural experience, had not been lacking\nthere; but they played no part in the memories which now he passed in\ntender review. He recalled instead the warm sunshine on the fertile\nexpanse of fields; the sleek, well-fed herds of “milkers” coming\nlowing down the road under the maples; the prosperous and hospitable\nfarmhouses, with their orchards in blossom and their spacious red barns;\nthe bountiful boiled dinners which cheery housewives served up with\ntheir own skilled hands. Of course, he admitted to himself, it would\nnot be the same if he were to go back there again. He was conscious of\nhaving moved along--was it, after all, an advance?--to a point where it\nwas unpleasant to sit at table with the unfragrant hired man, and still\nworse to encounter the bucolic confusion between the functions of\nknives and forks. But in those happy days--young, zealous, himself\nfarm-bred--these trifles had been invisible to him, and life there\namong those kindly husbandmen had seemed, by contrast with the gaunt\nsurroundings and gloomy rule of the theological seminary, luxuriously\nabundant and free.\n\nIt was there too that the crowning blessedness of his youth--nay, should\nhe not say of all his days?--had come to him. There he had first seen\nAlice Hastings,--the bright-eyed, frank-faced, serenely self-reliant\ngirl, who now, less than four years thereafter, could be heard washing\nthe dishes out in the parsonage kitchen.\n\nHow wonderful she had seemed to him then! How beautiful and\nall-beneficent the miracle still appeared! Though herself the daughter\nof a farmer, her presence on a visit within the borders of his remote\ncountry charge had seemed to make everything, there a hundred times\nmore countrified than it had ever been before. She was fresh from the\nrefinements of a town seminary: she read books; it was known that\nshe could play upon the piano. Her clothes, her manners, her way of\nspeaking, the readiness of her thoughts and sprightly tongue--not\nleast, perhaps, the imposing current understanding as to her father's\nwealth--placed her on a glorified pinnacle far away from the girls of\nthe neighborhood. These honest and good-hearted creatures indeed\ncalled ceaseless attention to her superiority by their deference and\nopen-mouthed admiration, and treated it as the most natural thing in the\nworld that their young minister should be visibly “taken” with her.\n\nTheron Ware, in truth, left this first pastorate of his the following\nspring, in a transfiguring halo of romance. His new appointment was\nto Tyre--a somewhat distant village of traditional local pride and\nsubstance--and he was to be married only a day or so before entering\nupon his pastoral duties there. The good people among whom he had begun\nhis ministry took kindly credit to themselves that he had met his bride\nwhile she was “visiting round” their countryside. In part by jocose\ninquiries addressed to the expectant groom, in part by the confidences\nof the postmaster at the corners concerning the bulk and frequency of\nthe correspondence passing between Theron and the now remote Alice--they\nhad followed the progress of the courtship through the autumn and\nwinter with friendly zest. When he returned from the Conference, to say\ngood-bye and confess the happiness that awaited him, they gave him a\n“donation”--quite as if he were a married pastor with a home of his\nown, instead of a shy young bachelor, who received his guests and their\ncontributions in the house where he boarded.\n\nHe went away with tears of mingled regret and proud joy in his eyes,\nthinking a good deal upon their predictions of a distinguished career\nbefore him, feeling infinitely strengthened and upborne by the hearty\nfervor of their God-speed, and taking with him nearly two wagon-loads of\nvegetables, apples, canned preserves, assorted furniture, glass dishes,\ncheeses, pieced bedquilts, honey, feathers, and kitchen utensils.\n\nOf the three years' term in Tyre, it was pleasantest to dwell upon the\nbeginning.\n\nThe young couple--after being married out at Alice's home in an\nadjoining county, under the depressing conditions of a hopelessly\nbedridden mother, and a father and brothers whose perceptions were\nobviously closed to the advantages of a matrimonial connection with\nMethodism--came straight to the house which their new congregation\nrented as a parsonage. The impulse of reaction from the rather grim\ncheerlessness of their wedding lent fresh gayety to their lighthearted,\nwhimsical start at housekeeping. They had never laughed so much in all\ntheir lives as they did now in these first months--over their weird\nignorance of domestic details; with its mishaps, mistakes, and\nentertaining discoveries; over the comical super-abundances and\nshortcomings of their “donation” outfit; over the thousand and one\nquaint experiences of their novel relation to each other, to the\ncongregation, and to the world of Tyre at large.\n\nTheron, indeed, might be said never to have laughed before. Up to that\ntime no friendly student of his character, cataloguing his admirable\nqualities, would have thought of including among them a sense of humor,\nmuch less a bent toward levity. Neither his early strenuous battle to\nget away from the farm and achieve such education as should serve\nto open to him the gates of professional life, nor the later wave of\nreligious enthusiasm which caught him up as he stood on the border-land\nof manhood, and swept him off into a veritable new world of views and\naspirations, had been a likely school of merriment. People had prized\nhim for his innocent candor and guileless mind, for his good heart, his\npious zeal, his modesty about gifts notably above the average, but it\nhad occurred to none to suspect in him a latent funny side.\n\nBut who could be solemn where Alice was?--Alice in a quandary over the\ncomplications of her cooking stove; Alice boiling her potatoes all day,\nand her eggs for half an hour; Alice ordering twenty pounds of steak and\nhalf a pound of sugar, and striving to extract a breakfast beverage from\nthe unground coffee-bean? Clearly not so tenderly fond and sympathetic a\nhusband as Theron. He began by laughing because she laughed, and grew by\nswift stages to comprehend, then frankly to share, her amusement. From\nthis it seemed only a step to the development of a humor of his own,\ndoubling, as it were, their sportive resources. He found himself\ndiscovering a new droll aspect in men and things; his phraseology took\non a dryly playful form, fittingly to present conceits which danced up,\nunabashed, quite into the presence of lofty and majestic truths. He\ngot from this nothing but satisfaction; it obviously involved increased\nclaims to popularity among his parishioners, and consequently magnified\npowers of usefulness, and it made life so much more a joy and a thing to\nbe thankful for. Often, in the midst of the exchange of merry quip\nand whimsical suggestion, bright blossoms on that tree of strength and\nknowledge which he felt expanding now with a mighty outward pushing\nin all directions, he would lapse into deep gravity, and ponder with a\nswelling heart the vast unspeakable marvel of his blessedness, in being\nthus enriched and humanized by daily communion with the most worshipful\nof womankind.\n\nThis happy and good young couple took the affections of Tyre by storm.\nThe Methodist Church there had at no time held its head very high among\nthe denominations, and for some years back had been in a deplorably\nsinking state, owing first to the secession of the Free Methodists and\nthen to the incumbency of a pastor who scandalized the community by\nmarrying a black man to a white woman. But the Wares changed all this.\nWithin a month the report of Theron's charm and force in the pulpit was\ncrowding the church building to its utmost capacity--and that, too,\nwith some of Tyre's best people. Equally winning was the atmosphere of\njollity and juvenile high spirits which pervaded the parsonage under\nthese new conditions, and which Theron and Alice seemed to diffuse\nwherever they went.\n\nThus swimmingly their first year sped, amid universal acclaim. Mrs. Ware\nhad a recognized social place, quite outside the restricted limits of\nMethodism, and shone in it with an unflagging brilliancy altogether\nbeyond the traditions of Tyre. Delightful as she was in other people's\nhouses, she was still more naively fascinating in her own quaint and\nsomewhat harum-scarum domicile; and the drab, two-storied, tin-roofed\nlittle parsonage might well have rattled its clapboards to see if it\nwas not in dreamland--so gay was the company, so light were the hearts,\nwhich it sheltered in these new days. As for Theron, the period was one\nof incredible fructification and output. He scarcely recognized for his\nown the mind which now was reaching out on all sides with the arms of\nan octopus, exploring unsuspected mines of thought, bringing in rich\ntreasures of deduction, assimilating, building, propounding as if by\nsome force quite independent of him. He could not look without blinking\ntimidity at the radiance of the path stretched out before him, leading\nupward to dazzling heights of greatness.\n\nAt the end of this first year the Wares suddenly discovered that they\nwere eight hundred dollars in debt.\n\nThe second year was spent in arriving, by slow stages and with a cruel\nwealth of pathetic detail, at a realization of what being eight hundred\ndollars in debt meant.\n\nIt was not in their elastic and buoyant natures to grasp the full\nsignificance of the thing at once, or easily. Their position in the\nsocial structure, too, was all against clear-sightedness in material\nmatters. A general, for example, uniformed and in the saddle, advancing\nthrough the streets with his staff in the proud wake of his division's\nmassed walls of bayonets, cannot be imagined as quailing at the glance\nthrown at him by his tailor on the sidewalk. Similarly, a man invested\nwith sacerdotal authority, who baptizes, marries, and buries, who\ndelivers judgments from the pulpit which may not be questioned in his\nhearing, and who receives from all his fellow-men a special deference of\nmanner and speech, is in the nature of things prone to see the grocer's\nbook and the butcher's bill through the little end of the telescope.\n\nThe Wares at the outset had thought it right to trade as exclusively as\npossible with members of their own church society. This loyalty became\na principal element of martyrdom. Theron had his creditors seated in\nserried rows before him, Sunday after Sunday. Alice had her critics\nconsolidated among those whom it was her chief duty to visit and profess\nfriendship for. These situations now began, by regular gradations, to\nunfold their terrors. At the first intimation of discontent, the Wares\nmade what seemed to them a sweeping reduction in expenditure. When\nthey heard that Brother Potter had spoken of them as “poor pay,” they\ndismissed their hired girl. A little later, Theron brought himself\nto drop a laboriously casual suggestion as to a possible increase of\nsalary, and saw with sinking spirits the faces of the stewards freeze\nwith dumb disapprobation. Then Alice paid a visit to her parents, only\nto find her brothers doggedly hostile to the notion of her being helped,\nand her father so much under their influence that the paltry sum he\ndared offer barely covered the expenses of her journey. With another\nturn of the screw, they sold the piano she had brought with her from\nhome, and cut themselves down to the bare necessities of life, neither\nreceiving company nor going out. They never laughed now, and even smiles\ngrew rare.\n\nBy this time Theron's sermons, preached under that stony glare of\npeople to whom he owed money, had degenerated to a pitiful level of\ncommonplace. As a consequence, the attendance became once more\nconfined to the insufficient membership of the church, and the trustees\ncomplained of grievously diminished receipts. When the Wares, grown\ndesperate, ventured upon the experiment of trading outside the bounds of\nthe congregation, the trustees complained again, this time peremptorily.\n\nThus the second year dragged itself miserably to an end. Nor was\nrelief possible, because the Presiding Elder knew something of the\ncircumstances, and felt it his duty to send Theron back for a third\nyear, to pay his debts, and drain the cup of disciplinary medicine to\nits dregs.\n\nThe worst has been told. Beginning in utter blackness, this third year,\nin the second month, brought a change as welcome as it was unlooked for.\nAn elderly and important citizen of Tyre, by name Abram Beekman, whom\nTheron knew slightly, and had on occasions seen sitting in one of\nthe back pews near the door, called one morning at the parsonage, and\nelectrified its inhabitants by expressing a desire to wipe off all their\nold scores for them, and give them a fresh start in life. As he put the\nsuggestion, they could find no excuse for rejecting it. He had watched\nthem, and heard a good deal about them, and took a fatherly sort of\ninterest in them. He did not deprecate their regarding the aid he\nproffered them in the nature of a loan, but they were to make themselves\nperfectly easy about it, and never return it at all unless they could\nspare it sometime with entire convenience, and felt that they wanted to\ndo so. As this amazing windfall finally took shape, it enabled the Wares\nto live respectably through the year, and to leave Tyre with something\nover one hundred dollars in hand.\n\nIt enabled them, too, to revive in a chastened form their old dream of\nultimate success and distinction for Theron. He had demonstrated clearly\nenough to himself, during that brief season of unrestrained effulgence,\nthat he had within him the making of a great pulpit orator. He set\nto work now, with resolute purpose, to puzzle out and master all the\nprinciples which underlie this art, and all the tricks that adorn its\nsuperstructure. He studied it, fastened his thoughts upon it, talked\ndaily with Alice about it. In the pulpit, addressing those people who\nhad so darkened his life and crushed the first happiness out of his\nhome, he withheld himself from any oratorical display which could afford\nthem gratification. He put aside, as well; the thought of attracting\nonce more the non-Methodists of Tyre, whose early enthusiasm had\nspread such pitfalls for his unwary feet. He practised effects now\nby piecemeal, with an alert ear, and calculation in every tone. An\nambition, at once embittered and tearfully solicitous, possessed him.\n\nHe reflected now, this morning, with a certain incredulous interest,\nupon that unworthy epoch in his life history, which seemed so far behind\nhim, and yet had come to a close only a few weeks ago. The opportunity\nhad been given him, there at the Tecumseh Conference, to reveal his\nquality. He had risen to its full limit of possibilities, and preached\na great sermon in a manner which he at least knew was unapproachable. He\nhad made his most powerful bid for the prize place, had trebly deserved\nsuccess--and had been banished instead to Octavius!\n\nThe curious thing was that he did not resent his failure. Alice had\ntaken it hard, but he himself was conscious of a sense of spiritual\ngain. The influence of the Conference, with its songs and seasons of\nprayer and high pressure of emotional excitement, was still strong upon\nhim. It seemed years and years since the religious side of him had been\nso stirred into motion. He felt, as he lay back in the chair, and folded\nhis hands over the book on his knee, that he had indeed come forth\nfrom the fire purified and strengthened. The ministry to souls diseased\nbeckoned him with a new and urgent significance. He smiled to remember\nthat Mr. Beekman, speaking in his shrewd and pointed way, had asked him\nwhether, looking it all over, he didn't think it would be better for\nhim to study law, with a view to sliding out of the ministry when a good\nchance offered. It amazed him now to recall that he had taken this\nhint seriously, and even gone to the length of finding out what books\nlaw-students began upon.\n\nThank God! all that was past and gone now. The Call sounded, resonant\nand imperative, in his ears, and there was no impulse of his heart, no\nfibre of his being, which did not stir in devout response. He closed his\neyes, to be the more wholly alone with the Spirit, that moved him.\n\nThe jangling of a bell in the hallway broke sharply upon his\nmeditations, and on the instant his wife thrust in her head from the\nkitchen.\n\n“You'll have to go to the door, Theron!” she warned him, in a loud,\nswift whisper. “I'm not fit to be seen. It is the trustees.”\n\n“All right,” he said, and rose slowly from sprawling recumbency to his\nfeet. “I'll go.”\n\n“And don't forget,” she added strenuously; “I believe in Levi Gorringe!\nI've seen him go past here with his rod and fish-basket twice in eight\ndays, and that's a good sign. He's got a soft side somewhere. And just\nkeep a stiff upper lip about the gas, and don't you let them jew you\ndown a solitary cent on that sidewalk.”\n\n“All right,” said Theron, again, and moved reluctantly toward the hall\ndoor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nWhen the three trustees had been shown in by the Rev. Mr. Ware, and had\ntaken seats, an awkward little pause ensued. The young minister looked\ndoubtingly from one face to another, the while they glanced with\ninquiring interest about the room, noting the pictures and appraising\nthe furniture in their minds.\n\nThe obvious leader of the party, Loren Pierce, a rich quarryman, was an\nold man of medium size and mean attire, with a square, beardless face as\nhard and impassive in expression as one of his blocks of limestone. The\nirregular, thin-lipped mouth, slightly sunken, and shut with vice-like\nfirmness, the short snub nose, and the little eyes squinting from\nhalf-closed lids beneath slightly marked brows, seemed scarcely to\nattain to the dignity of features, but evaded attention instead, as if\nfeeling that they were only there at all from plain necessity, and ought\nnot to be taken into account. Mr. Pierce's face did not know how to\nsmile--what was the use of smiles?--but its whole surface radiated\nsecretiveness. Portrayed on canvas by a master brush, with a ruff or a\nred robe for masquerade, generations of imaginative amateurs would\nhave seen in it vast reaching plots, the skeletons of a dozen dynastic\ncupboards, the guarded mysteries of half a century's international\ndiplomacy. The amateurs would have been wrong again. There was nothing\nbehind Mr. Pierce's juiceless countenance more weighty than a general\ndetermination to exact seven per cent for his money, and some specific\nnotions about capturing certain brickyards which were interfering with\nhis quarry-sales. But Octavius watched him shamble along its sidewalks\nquite as the Vienna of dead and forgotten yesterday might have watched\nMetternich.\n\nErastus Winch was of a breezier sort--a florid, stout, and sandy man,\nwho spent most of his life driving over evil country roads in a buggy,\nsecuring orders for dairy furniture and certain allied lines of farm\nutensils. This practice had given him a loud voice and a deceptively\nhearty manner, to which the other avocation of cheese-buyer, which he\npursued at the Board of Trade meetings every Monday afternoon, had added\na considerable command of persuasive yet non-committal language. To\nlook at him, still more to hear him, one would have sworn he was a good\nfellow, a trifle rough and noisy, perhaps, but all right at bottom.\nBut the County Clerk of Dearborn County could have told you of\nagriculturists who knew Erastus from long and unhappy experience, and\nwho held him to be even a tighter man than Loren Pierce in the matter of\na mortgage.\n\nThe third trustee, Levi Gorringe, set one wondering at the very first\nglance what on earth he was doing in that company. Those who had known\nhim longest had the least notion; but it may be added that no one knew\nhim well. He was a lawyer, and had lived in Octavius for upwards of ten\nyears; that is to say, since early manhood. He had an office on the main\nstreet, just under the principal photograph gallery. Doubtless he was\nsometimes in this office; but his fellow-townsmen saw him more often\nin the street doorway, with the stairs behind him, and the flaring\nshow-cases of the photographer on either side, standing with his hands\nin his pockets and an unlighted cigar in his mouth, looking at nothing\nin particular. About every other day he went off after breakfast into\nthe country roundabout, sometimes with a rod, sometimes with a gun, but\nalways alone. He was a bachelor, and slept in a room at the back of\nhis office, cooking some of his meals himself, getting others at a\nrestaurant close by. Though he had little visible practice, he was\nunderstood to be well-to-do and even more, and people tacitly inferred\nthat he “shaved notes.” The Methodists of Octavius looked upon him as\na queer fish, and through nearly a dozen years had never quite outgrown\ntheir hebdomadal tendency to surprise at seeing him enter their church.\nHe had never, it is true, professed religion, but they had elected him\nas a trustee now for a number of terms, all the same--partly because he\nwas their only lawyer, partly because he, like both his colleagues, held\na mortgage on the church edifice and lot. In person, Mr. Gorringe was a\nslender man, with a skin of a clear, uniform citron tint, black waving\nhair, and dark gray eyes, and a thin, high-featured face. He wore\na mustache and pointed chin-tuft; and, though he was of New England\nparentage and had never been further south than Ocean Grove, he\npresented a general effect of old Mississippian traditions and tastes\nstartlingly at variance with the standards of Dearborn County Methodism.\nNothing could convince some of the elder sisters that he was not a\ndrinking man.\n\nThe three visitors had completed their survey of the room now; and Loren\nPierce emitted a dry, harsh little cough, as a signal that business\nwas about to begin. At this sound, Winch drew up his feet, and Gorringe\nuntied a parcel of account-books and papers that he held on his knee.\nTheron felt that his countenance must be exhibiting to the assembled\nbrethren an unfortunate sense of helplessness in their hands. He tried\nto look more resolute, and forced his lips into a smile.\n\n“Brother Gorringe allus acts as Seckertary,” said Erastus Winch, beaming\nbroadly upon the minister, as if the mere mention of the fact promoted\njollity. “That's it, Brother Gorringe,--take your seat at Brother Ware's\ndesk. Mind the Dominie's pen don't play tricks on you, an' start off\nwritin' out sermons instid of figgers.” The humorist turned to Theron\nas the lawyer walked over to the desk at the window. “I allus have to\ncaution him about that,” he remarked with great joviality. “An' do YOU\nlook out afterwards, Brother Ware, or else you'll catch that pen o'\nyours scribblin' lawyer's lingo in place o' the Word.”\n\nTheron felt bound to exhibit a grin in acknowledgment of this\npleasantry. The lawyer's change of position had involved some shifting\nof the others' chairs, and the young minister found himself directly\nconfronted by Brother Pierce's hard and colorless old visage. Its little\neyes were watching him, as through a mask, and under their influence\nthe smile of politeness fled from his lips. The lawyer on his right, the\ncheese-buyer to the left, seemed to recede into distance as he for the\nmoment returned the gaze of the quarryman. He waited now for him to\nspeak, as if the others were of no importance.\n\n“We are a plain sort o' folks up in these parts,” said Brother Pierce,\nafter a slight further pause. His voice was as dry and rasping as his\ncough, and its intonations were those of authority. “We walk here,” he\nwent on, eying the minister with a sour regard, “in a meek an' humble\nspirit, in the straight an' narrow way which leadeth unto life. We ain't\ngone traipsin' after strange gods, like some people that call themselves\nMethodists in other places. We stick by the Discipline an' the ways of\nour fathers in Israel. No new-fangled notions can go down here. Your\nwife'd better take them flowers out of her bunnit afore next Sunday.”\n\nSilence possessed the room for a few moments, the while Theron,\npale-faced and with brows knit, studied the pattern of the ingrain\ncarpet. Then he lifted his head, and nodded it in assent. “Yes,”\n he said; “we will do nothing by which our 'brother stumbleth, or is\noffended, or is made weak.'”\n\nBrother Pierce's parchment face showed no sign of surprise or pleasure\nat this easy submission. “Another thing: We don't want no book-learnin'\nor dictionary words in our pulpit,” he went on coldly. “Some folks may\nstomach 'em; we won't. Them two sermons o' yours, p'r'aps they'd do down\nin some city place; but they're like your wife's bunnit here, they're\ntoo flowery to suit us. What we want to hear is the plain, old-fashioned\nWord of God, without any palaver or 'hems and ha's. They tell me\nthere's some parts where hell's treated as played-out--where our\nministers don't like to talk much about it because people don't want to\nhear about it. Such preachers ought to be put out. They ain't Methodists\nat all. What we want here, sir, is straight-out, flat-footed hell--the\nburnin' lake o' fire an' brim-stone. Pour it into 'em, hot an' strong.\nWe can't have too much of it. Work in them awful deathbeds of Voltaire\nan' Tom Paine, with the Devil right there in the room, reachin' for\n'em, an' they yellin' for fright; that's what fills the anxious seat an'\nbrings in souls hand over fist.”\n\nTheron's tongue dallied for an instant with the temptation to comment\nupon these old-wife fables, which were so dear to the rural religious\nheart when he and I were boys. But it seemed wiser to only nod again,\nand let his mentor go on.\n\n“We ain't had no trouble with the Free Methodists here,” continued\nBrother Pierce, “jest because we kept to the old paths, an' seek for\nsalvation in the good old way. Everybody can shout 'Amen!' as loud\nand as long as the Spirit moves him, with us. Some one was sayin' you\nthought we ought to have a choir and an organ. No, sirree! No such\ntom-foolery for us! You'll only stir up feelin' agin yourself by hintin'\nat such things. And then, too, our folks don't take no stock in all that\npack o' nonsense about science, such as tellin' the age of the earth by\ncrackin' up stones. I've b'en in the quarry line all my life, an' I know\nit's all humbug! Why, they say some folks are goin' round now preachin'\nthat our grandfathers were all monkeys. That comes from departin'\nfrom the ways of our forefathers, an puttin' in organs an' choirs, an'\ndeckin' our women-folks out with gewgaws, an' apin' the fashions of the\nworldly. I shouldn't wonder if them kind did have some monkey blood in\n'em. You'll find we're a different sort here.”\n\nThe young minister preserved silence for a little, until it became\napparent that the old trustee had had his say out. Even then he raised\nhis head slowly, and at last made answer in a hesitating and irresolute\nway.\n\n“You have been very frank,” he said. “I am obliged to you. A clergyman\ncoming to a new charge cannot be better served than by having\nlaid before him a clear statement of the views and--and spiritual\ntendencies--of his new flock, quite at the outset. I feel it to be\nof especial value in this case, because I am young in years and in my\nministry, and am conscious of a great weakness of the flesh. I can\nsee how daily contact with a people so attached to the old, simple,\nprimitive Methodism of Wesley and Asbury may be a source of much\nstrength to me. I may take it,” he added upon second thought, with an\ninquiring glance at Mr. Winch, “that Brother Pierce's description of our\ncharge, and its tastes and needs, meets with your approval?”\n\nErastus Winch nodded his head and smiled expansively. “Whatever Brother\nPierce says, goes!” he declared. The lawyer, sitting behind at the desk\nby the window, said nothing.\n\n“The place is jest overrun with Irish,” Brother Pierce began again.\n“They've got two Catholic churches here now to our one, and they do jest\nas they blamed please at the Charter elections. It'd be a good idee to\npitch into Catholics in general whenever you can. You could make a hit\nthat way. I say the State ought to make 'em pay taxes on their church\nproperty. They've no right to be exempted, because they ain't Christians\nat all. They're idolaters, that's what they are! I know 'em! I've had\n'em in my quarries for years, an' they ain't got no idee of decency or\nfair dealin'. Every time the price of stone went up, every man of 'em\nwould jine to screw more wages out o' me. Why, they used to keep account\no' the amount o' business I done, an' figger up my profits, an' have\nthe face to come an' talk to me about 'em, as if that had anything to do\nwith wages. It's my belief their priests put 'em up to it. People\ndon't begin to reelize--that church of idolatry 'll be the ruin o' this\ncountry, if it ain't checked in time. Jest you go at 'em hammer 'n'\ntongs! I've got Eyetalians in the quarries now. They're sensible\nfellows: they know when they're well off--a dollar a day, an' they're\nsatisfied, an' everything goes smooth.”\n\n“But they're Catholics, the same as the Irish,” suddenly interjected the\nlawyer, from his place by the window. Theron pricked up his ears at the\nsound of his voice. There was an anti-Pierce note in it, so to speak,\nwhich it did him good to hear. The consciousness of sympathy began on\nthe instant to inspire him with courage.\n\n“I know some people SAY they are,” Brother Pierce guardedly retorted\n“but I've summered an' wintered both kinds, an' I hold to it they're\ndifferent. I grant ye, the Eyetalians ARE some given to jabbin' knives\ninto each other, but they never git up strikes, an' they don't grumble\nabout wages. Why, look at the way they live--jest some weeds an' yarbs\ndug up on the roadside, an' stewed in a kettle with a piece o' fat the\nsize o' your finger, an' a loaf o' bread, an' they're happy as a king.\nThere's some sense in THAT; but the Irish, they've got to have meat an'\npotatoes an' butter jest as if--as if--”\n\n“As if they'd b'en used to 'em at home,” put in Mr. Winch, to help his\ncolleague out.\n\nThe lawyer ostentatiously drew up his chair to the desk, and began\nturning over the leaves of his biggest book. “It's getting on toward\nnoon, gentlemen,” he said, in an impatient voice.\n\nThe business meeting which followed was for a considerable time confined\nto hearing extracts from the books and papers read in a swift and formal\nfashion by Mr. Gorringe. If this was intended to inform the new pastor\nof the exact financial situation in Octavius, it lamentably failed of\nits purpose. Theron had little knowledge of figures; and though he\ntried hard to listen, and to assume an air of comprehension, he did not\nunderstand much of what he heard. In a general way he gathered that the\nchurch property was put down at $12,000, on which there was a debt of\n$4,800. The annual expenses were $2,250, of which the principal items\nwere $800 for his salary, $170 for the rent of the parsonage, and $319\nfor interest on the debt. It seemed that last year the receipts had\nfallen just under $2,000, and they now confronted the necessity of\nmaking good this deficit during the coming year, as well as increasing\nthe regular revenues. Without much discussion, it was agreed that they\nshould endeavor to secure the services of a celebrated “debt-raiser,”\n early in the autumn, and utilize him in the closing days of a revival.\n\nTheron knew this “debt-raiser,” and had seen him at work--a burly,\nbustling, vulgar man who took possession of the pulpit as if it were an\nauctioneer's block, and pursued the task of exciting liberality in the\nbosoms of the congregation by alternating prayer, anecdote, song,\nand cheap buffoonery in a manner truly sickening. Would it not be\npreferable, he feebly suggested, to raise the money by a festival, or\nfair, or some other form of entertainment which the ladies could manage?\n\nBrother Pierce shook his head with contemptuous emphasis. “Our\nwomen-folks ain't that kind,” he said. “They did try to hold a sociable\nonce, but nobody came, and we didn't raise more 'n three or four\ndollars. It ain't their line. They lack the worldly arts. As the\nDiscipline commands, they avoid the evil of putting on gold and costly\napparel, and taking such diversions as cannot be used in the name of the\nLord Jesus.”\n\n“Well--of course--if you prefer the 'debt-raiser'--” Theron began, and\ntook the itemized account from Gorringe's knee as an excuse for not\nfinishing the hateful sentence.\n\nHe looked down the foolscap sheet, line by line, with no special sense\nof what it signified, until his eye caught upon this little section of\nthe report, bracketed by itself in the Secretary's neat hand:\n\n     INTEREST CHARGE.\n\n     First mortgage (1873) .. $1,000 ... (E. Winch)    @7.. $ 70\n     Second mortgage (1776)..  1,700 ... (L. Gorringe) @6..  102\n     Third mortgage (1878)...  2,100 ... (L. Pierce)   @7..  147\n     -------                       -----\n     $4,800                        $319\n\nIt was no news to him that the three mortgages on the church property\nwere held by the three trustees. But as he looked once more, another\nfeature of the thing struck him as curious.\n\n“I notice that the rates of interest vary,” he remarked without\nthinking, and then wished the words unsaid, for the two trustees in view\nmoved uneasily on their seats.\n\n“Oh, that's nothing,” exclaimed Erastus Winch, with a boisterous display\nof jollity. “It's only Brother Gorringe's pleasant little way of making\na contribution to our funds. You will notice that, at the date of all\nthese mortgages, the State rate of interest was seven per cent. Since\nthen it's b'en lowered to six. Well, when that happened, you see,\nBrother Gorringe, not being a professin' member, and so not bound by our\nrules, he could just as well as not let his interest down a cent. But\nBrother Pierce an' me, we talked it over, an' we made up our minds\nwe were tied hand an' foot by our contract. You know how strong the\nDiscipline lays it down that we must be bound to the letter of our\nagreements. That bein' so, we seen it in the light of duty not to change\nwhat we'd set our hands to. That's how it is, Brother Ware.”\n\n“I understand,” said Theron, with an effort at polite calmness of tone.\n“And--is there anything else?”\n\n“There's this,” broke in Brother Pierce: “we're commanded to be\nlaw-abiding people, an' seven per cent WAS the law an' would be now if\nthem ragamuffins in the Legislation--”\n\n“Surely we needn't go further into that,” interrupted the minister,\nconscious of a growing stiffness in his moral spine. “Have we any other\nbusiness before us?”\n\nBrother Pierce's little eyes snapped, and the wrinkles in his forehead\ndeepened angrily. “Business?” he demanded. “Yes, plenty of it. We've\ngot to reduce expenses. We're nigh onto $300 behind-hand this minute.\nBesides your house-rent, you get $800 free an' clear--that is $15.38\nevery week, an' only you an' your wife to keep out of it. Why, when\nI was your age, young man, and after that too, I was glad to get $4 a\nweek.”\n\n“I don't think my salary is under discussion, Mr. Pierce--”\n\n“BROTHER Pierce!” suggested Winch, in a half-shuckling undertone.\n\n“Brother Pierce, then!” echoed Theron, impatiently. “The Quarterly\nConference and the Estimating Committee deal with that. The trustees\nhave no more to do with it than the man in the moon.”\n\n“Come, come, Brother Ware,” put in Erastus Winch, “we mustn't have no\nhard feelin's. Brotherly love is what we're all lookin' after. Brother\nPierce's meanin' wasn't agin your drawin' your full salary, every cent\nof it, only--only there are certain little things connected with the\nparsonage here that we feel you ought to bear. F'r instance, there's the\nnew sidewalk we had to lay in front of the house here only a month ago.\nOf course, if the treasury was flush we wouldn't say a word about it.\nAn' then there's the gas bill here. Seein' as you get your rent for\nnothin', it don't seem much to ask that you should see to lightin' the\nplace yourself.”\n\n“No, I don't think that either is a proper charge upon me,” interposed\nTheron. “I decline to pay them.”\n\n“We can have the gas shut off,” remarked Brother Pierce, coldly.\n\n“As soon as you like,” responded the minister, sitting erect and tapping\nthe carpet nervously with his foot. “Only you must understand that I will\ntake the whole matter to the Quarterly Conference in July. I already see\na good many other interesting questions about the financial management\nof this church which might be appropriately discussed there.”\n\n“Oh, come, Brother Ware!” broke in Trustee Winch, with a somewhat\nagitated assumption of good-feeling. “Surely these are matters we ought\nto settle amongst ourselves. We never yet asked outsiders to meddle with\nour business here. It's our motto, Brother Ware. I say, if you've got a\nmotto, stand by it.”\n\n“Well, my motto,” said Theron, “is to be behaved decently to by those\nwith whom I have to deal; and I also propose to stand by it.”\n\nBrother Pierce rose gingerly to his feet, with the hesitation of an old\nman not sure about his knees. When he had straightened himself, he put\non his hat, and eyed the minister sternly from beneath its brim.\n\n“The Lord gives us crosses grievous to our natur',” he said, “an' we're\ntold to bear 'em cheerfully as long as they're on our backs; but there\nain't nothin' said agin our unloadin' 'em in the ditch the minute we git\nthe chance. I guess you won't last here more 'n a twelvemonth.”\n\nHe pulled his soft and discolored old hat down over his brows with a\nsignificantly hostile nod, and, turning, stumped toward the hall-door\nwithout offering to shake hands.\n\nThe other trustees had risen likewise, in tacit recognition that the\nmeeting was over. Winch clasped the minister's hand in his own broad,\nhard palm, and squeezed it in an exuberant grip. “Don't mind his little\nways, Brother Ware,” he urged in a loud, unctuous whisper, with a\ngrinning backward nod: “he's a trifle skittish sometimes when you don't\ngive him free rein; but he's all wool an' a yard wide when it comes to\nright-down hard-pan religion. My love to Sister Ware;” and he followed\nthe senior trustee into the hall.\n\nMr. Gorringe had been tying up his books and papers. He came now with\nthe bulky parcel under his arm, and his hat and stick in the other hand.\nHe could give little but his thumb to Theron to shake. His face wore\na grave expression, and not a line relaxed as, catching the minister's\nlook, he slowly covered his left eye in a deliberate wink.\n\n\n\n“Well?--and how did it go off?” asked Alice, from where she knelt by the\noven door, a few minutes later.\n\nFor answer, Theron threw himself wearily into the big old farm\nrocking-chair on the other side of the stove, and shook his head with a\nlengthened sigh.\n\n“If it wasn't for that man Gorringe of yours,” he said dejectedly, “I\nthink I should feel like going off--and learning a trade.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nOn the following Sunday, young Mrs. Ware sat alone in the preacher's pew\nthrough the morning service, and everybody noted that the roses had\nbeen taken from her bonnet. In the evening she was absent, and after\nthe doxology and benediction several people, under the pretence of\nsolicitude for her health, tried to pump her husband as to the reason.\nHe answered their inquiries civilly enough, but with brevity: she\nhad stayed at home because she did not feel like coming out--this and\nnothing more.\n\nThe congregation dispersed under a gossip-laden cloud of consciousness\nthat there must be something queer about Sister Ware. There was a\ntolerably general agreement, however, that the two sermons of the day\nhad been excellent. Not even Loren Pierce's railing commentary on the\npastor's introduction of an outlandish word like “epitome”--clearly\nforbidden by the Discipline's injunction to plain language understood of\nthe people--availed to sap the satisfaction of the majority.\n\nTheron himself comprehended that he had pleased the bulk of his\nauditors; the knowledge left him curiously hot and cold. On the one\nhand, there was joy in the apparent prospect that the congregation would\nback him up in a stand against the trustees, if worst came to worst.\nBut, on the other hand, the bonnet episode entered his soul. It had\nbeen a source of bitter humiliation to him to see his wife sitting there\nbeneath the pulpit, shorn by despotic order of the adornments natural\nto her pretty head. But he had even greater pain in contemplating the\neffect it had produced on Alice herself. She had said not a word on the\nsubject, but her every glance and gesture seemed to him eloquent of deep\nfeeling about it. He made sure that she blamed him for having defended\nhis own gas and sidewalk rights with successful vigor, but permitted\nthe sacrifice of her poor little inoffensive roses without a protest. In\nthis view of the matter, indeed, he blamed himself. Was it too late to\nmake the error good? He ventured a hint on this Sunday evening, when he\nreturned to the parsonage and found her reading an old weekly newspaper\nby the light of the kitchen lamp, to the effect that he fancied there\nwould be no great danger in putting those roses back into her bonnet.\nWithout lifting her eyes from the paper, she answered that she had\nno earthly desire to wear roses in her bonnet, and went on with her\nreading.\n\nAt breakfast the next morning Theron found himself in command of an\nunusual fund of humorous good spirits, and was at pains to make the\nmost of it, passing whimsical comments on subjects which the opening\nday suggested, recalling quaint and comical memories of the past, and\nstriving his best to force Alice into a laugh. Formerly her merry temper\nhad always ignited at the merest spark of gayety. Now she gave his jokes\nonly a dutiful half-smile, and uttered scarcely a word in response to\nhis running fire of talk. When the meal was finished, she went silently\nto work to clear away the dishes.\n\nTheron turned over in his mind the project of offering to help her, as\nhe had done so often in those dear old days when they laughingly began\nlife together. Something decided this project in the negative for him,\nand after lingering moments he put on his hat and went out for a walk.\n\nNot even the most doleful and trying hour of his bitter experience in\nTyre had depressed him like this. Looking back upon these past troubles,\nhe persuaded himself that he had borne them all with a light and\ncheerful heart, simply because Alice had been one with him in every\nthought and emotion. How perfect, how ideally complete, their sympathy\nhad always been! With what absolute unity of mind and soul they had\ntrod that difficult path together! And now--henceforth--was it to be\ndifferent? The mere suggestion of such a thing chilled his veins. He\nsaid aloud to himself as he walked that life would be an intolerable\ncurse if Alice were to cease sharing it with him in every conceivable\nphase.\n\nHe had made his way out of town, and tramped along the country hill-road\nfor a considerable distance, before a merciful light began to lessen the\nshadows in the picture of gloom with which his mind tortured itself.\nAll at once he stopped short, lifted his head, and looked about him. The\nbroad valley lay warm and tranquil in the May sunshine at his feet. In\nthe thicket up the side-hill above him a gray squirrel was chattering\nshrilly, and the birds sang in a tireless choral confusion. Theron\nsmiled, and drew a long breath. The gay clamor of the woodland\nsongsters, the placid radiance of the landscape, were suddenly taken in\nand made a part of his new mood. He listened, smiled once more, and then\nstarted in a leisurely way back toward Octavius.\n\nHow could he have been so ridiculous as to fancy that Alice--his\nAlice--had been changed into someone else? He marvelled now at his own\nperverse folly. She was overworked--tired out--that was all. The task of\nmoving in, of setting the new household to rights, had been too much for\nher. She must have a rest. They must get in a hired girl.\n\nOnce this decision about a servant fixed itself in the young minister's\nmind, it drove out the last vestage of discomfort. He strode along now\nin great content, revolving idly a dozen different plans for gilding and\nbeautifying this new life of leisure into which his sanguine thoughts\nprojected Alice. One of these particularly pleased him, and waxed in\ndefiniteness as he turned it over and over. He would get another piano\nfor her, in place of that which had been sacrificed in Tyre. That\nbeneficient modern invention, the instalment plan, made this quite\nfeasible--so easy, in fact, that it almost seemed as if he should find\nhis wife playing on the new instrument when he got home. He would stop\nin at the music store and see about it that very day.\n\nOf course, now that these important resolutions had been taken, it would\nbe a good thing if he could do something to bring in some extra money.\nThis was by no means a new notion. He had mused over the possibility in\na formless way ever since that memorable discovery of indebtedness in\nTyre, and had long ago recognized the hopelessness of endeavor in every\nchannel save that of literature. Latterly his fancy had been stimulated\nby reading an account of the profits which Canon Farrar had derived from\nhis “Life of Christ.” If such a book could command such a bewildering\nmultitude of readers, Theron felt there ought to be a chance for him.\nSo clear did constant rumination render this assumption that the young\npastor in time had come to regard this prospective book of his as a\nsubstantial asset, which could be realized without trouble whenever he\ngot around to it.\n\nHe had not, it is true, gone to the length of seriously considering what\nshould be the subject of his book. That had not seemed to him to matter\nmuch, so long as it was scriptural. Familiarity with the process of\nextracting a fixed amount of spiritual and intellectual meat from any\ncasual text, week after week, had given him an idea that any one of\nmany subjects would do, when the time came for him to make a choice.\nHe realized now that the time for a selection had arrived, and almost\nsimultaneously found himself with a ready-made decision in his mind. The\nbook should be about Abraham!\n\nTheron Ware was extremely interested in the mechanism of his own brain,\nand followed its workings with a lively curiosity. Nothing could be more\nremarkable, he thought, than to thus discover that, on the instant of\nhis formulating a desire to know what he should write upon, lo, and\nbehold! there his mind, quite on its own initiative, had the answer\nwaiting for him! When he had gone a little further, and the powerful\nrange of possibilities in the son's revolt against the idolatry of his\nfather, the image-maker, in the exodus from the unholy city of Ur, and\nin the influence of the new nomadic life upon the little deistic family\ngroup, had begun to unfold itself before him, he felt that the hand of\nProvidence was plainly discernible in the matter. The book was to be\nblessed from its very inception.\n\nWalking homeward briskly now, with his eyes on the sidewalk and his mind\nall aglow with crowding suggestions for the new work, and impatience to\nbe at it, he came abruptly upon a group of men and boys who occupied the\nwhole path, and were moving forward so noiselessly that he had not heard\nthem coming. He almost ran into the leader of this little procession,\nand began a stammering apology, the final words of which were left\nunspoken, so solemnly heedless of him and his talk were all the faces he\nsaw.\n\nIn the centre of the group were four working-men, bearing between them\nan extemporized litter of two poles and a blanket hastily secured across\nthem with spikes. Most of what this litter held was covered by another\nblanket, rounded in coarse folds over a shapeless bulk. From beneath\nits farther end protruded a big broom-like black beard, thrown upward at\nsuch an angle as to hide everything beyond to those in front. The tall\nyoung minister, stepping aside and standing tip-toe, could see sloping\ndownward behind this hedge of beard a pinched and chalk-like face, with\nwide-open, staring eyes. Its lips, of a dull lilac hue, were moving\nceaselessly, and made a dry, clicking sound.\n\nTheron instinctively joined himself to those who followed the litter--a\nmotley dozen of street idlers, chiefly boys. One of these in whispers\nexplained to him that the man was one of Jerry Madden's workmen in the\nwagon-shops, who had been deployed to trim an elm-tree in front of his\nemployer's house, and, being unused to such work, had fallen from the\ntop and broken all his bones. They would have cared for him at Madden's\nhouse, but he had insisted upon being taken home. His name was MacEvoy,\nand he was Joey MacEvoy's father, and likewise Jim's and Hughey's and\nMartin's. After a pause the lad, a bright-eyed, freckled, barefooted wee\nIrishman, volunteered the further information that his big brother had\nrun to bring “Father Forbess,” on the chance that he might be in time to\nadminister “extry munction.”\n\nThe way of the silent little procession led through back streets--where\nwomen hanging up clothes in the yards hurried to the gates, their aprons\nfull of clothes-pins, to stare open-mouthed at the passers-by--and came\nto a halt at last in an irregular and muddy lane, before one of a half\ndozen shanties reared among the ash-heaps and debris of the town's most\nbedraggled outskirts.\n\nA stout, middle-aged, red-armed woman, already warned by some messenger\nof calamity, stood waiting on the roadside bank. There were whimpering\nchildren clinging to her skirts, and a surrounding cluster of women of\nthe neighborhood, some of the more elderly of whom, shrivelled little\ncrones in tidy caps, and with their aprons to their eyes, were beginning\nin a low-murmured minor the wail which presently should rise into the\nkeen of death. Mrs. MacEvoy herself made no moan, and her broad ruddy\nface was stern in expression rather than sorrowful. When the litter\nstopped beside her, she laid a hand for an instant on her husband's wet\nbrow, and looked--one could have sworn impassively--into his staring\neyes. Then, still without a word, she waved the bearers toward the door,\nand led the way herself.\n\nTheron, somewhat wonderingly, found himself, a minute later, inside a\ndark and ill-smelling room, the air of which was humid with the steam\nfrom a boiler of clothes on the stove, and not in other ways improved by\nthe presence of a jostling score of women, all straining their gaze upon\nthe open door of the only other apartment--the bed-chamber. Through\nthis they could see the workmen laying MacEvoy on the bed, and standing\nawkwardly about thereafter, getting in the way of the wife and old\nMaggie Quirk as they strove to remove the garments from his crushed\nlimbs. As the neighbors watched what could be seen of these proceedings,\nthey whispered among themselves eulogies of the injured man's industry\nand good temper, his habit of bringing his money home to his wife, and\nthe way he kept his Father Mathew pledge and attended to his religious\nduties. They admitted freely that, by the light of his example, their\nown husbands and sons left much to be desired, and from this wandered\neasily off into domestic digressions of their own. But all the while\ntheir eyes were bent upon the bedroom door; and Theron made out, after\nhe had grown accustomed to the gloom and the smell, that many of them\nwere telling their beads even while they kept the muttered conversation\nalive. None of them paid any attention to him, or seemed to regard his\npresence there as unusual.\n\nPresently he saw enter through the sunlit street doorway a person of\na different class. The bright light shone for a passing instant upon a\nfashionable, flowered hat, and upon some remarkably brilliant shade of\nred hair beneath it. In another moment there had edged along through the\nthrong, to almost within touch of him, a tall young woman, the owner of\nthis hat and wonderful hair. She was clad in light and pleasing spring\nattire, and carried a parasol with a long oxidized silver handle of a\nquaint pattern. She looked at him, and he saw that her face was of a\nlengthened oval, with a luminous rose-tinted skin, full red lips, and\nbig brown, frank eyes with heavy auburn lashes. She made a grave little\ninclination of her head toward him, and he bowed in response. Since her\narrival, he noted, the chattering of the others had entirely ceased.\n\n“I followed the others in, in the hope that I might be of some\nassistance,” he ventured to explain to her in a low murmur, feeling that\nat last here was some one to whom an explanation of his presence in this\nRomish house was due. “I hope they won't feel that I have intruded.”\n\nShe nodded her head as if she quite understood. “They'll take the will\nfor the deed,” she whispered back. “Father Forbes will be here in a\nminute. Do you know is it too late?”\n\nEven as she spoke, the outer doorway was darkened by the commanding bulk\nof a newcomer's figure. The flash of a silk hat, and the deferential way\nin which the assembled neighbors fell back to clear a passage, made his\nidentity clear. Theron felt his blood tingle in an unaccustomed way\nas this priest of a strange church advanced across the room--a\nbroad-shouldered, portly man of more than middle height, with a shapely,\nstrong-lined face of almost waxen pallor, and a firm, commanding tread.\nHe carried in his hands, besides his hat, a small leather-bound case. To\nthis and to him the women courtesied and bowed their heads as he passed.\n\n“Come with me,” whispered the tall girl with the parasol to Theron; and\nhe found himself pushing along in her wake until they intercepted the\npriest just outside the bedroom door. She touched Father Forbes on the\narm.\n\n“Just to tell you that I am here,” she said. The priest nodded with\na grave face, and passed into the other room. In a minute or two the\nworkmen, Mrs. MacEvoy, and her helper came out, and the door was shut\nbehind them.\n\n“He is making his confession,” explained the young lady. “Stay here for\na minute.”\n\nShe moved over to where the woman of the house stood, glum-faced and\ntearless, and whispered something to her. A confused movement among the\ncrowd followed, and out of it presently resulted a small table, covered\nwith a white cloth, and bearing on it two unlighted candles, a basin of\nwater, and a spoon, which was brought forward and placed in readiness\nbefore the closed door. Some of those nearest this cleared space were\nkneeling now, and murmuring a low buzz of prayer to the click of beads\non their rosaries.\n\nThe door opened, and Theron saw the priest standing in the doorway with\nan uplifted hand. He wore now a surplice, with a purple band over his\nshoulders, and on his pale face there shone a tranquil and tender light.\n\nOne of the workmen fetched from the stove a brand, lighted the two\ncandles, and bore the table with its contents into the bedroom. The\nyoung woman plucked Theron's sleeve, and he dumbly followed her into\nthe chamber of death, making one of the group of a dozen, headed by Mrs.\nMacEvoy and her children, which filled the little room, and overflowed\nnow outward to the street door. He found himself bowing with the others\nto receive the sprinkled holy water from the priest's white fingers;\nkneeling with the others for the prayers; following in impressed silence\nwith the others the strange ceremonial by which the priest traced\ncrosses of holy oil with his thumb upon the eyes, ears, nostrils, lips,\nhands, and feet of the dying man, wiping off the oil with a piece\nof cotton-batting each time after he had repeated the invocation to\nforgiveness for that particular sense. But most of all he was moved by\nthe rich, novel sound of the Latin as the priest rolled it forth in the\nASPERGES ME, DOMINE, and MISEREATUR VESTRI OMNIPOTENS DEUS, with its\nsoft Continental vowels and liquid R's. It seemed to him that he had\nnever really heard Latin before. Then the astonishing young woman with\nthe red hair declaimed the CONFITEOR, vigorously and with a resonant\ndistinctness of enunciation. It was a different Latin, harsher and more\nsonorous; and while it still dominated the murmured undertone of the\nother's prayers, the last moment came.\n\nTheron had stood face to face with death at many other bedsides; no\nother final scene had stirred him like this. It must have been\nthe girl's Latin chant, with its clanging reiteration of the great\nnames--BEATUM MICHAELEM ARCHANGELUM, BEATUM JOANNEM BAPTISTAM, SANCTOS\nAPOSTOLOS PETRUM ET PAULUM--invoked with such proud confidence in this\nsqualid little shanty, which so strangely affected him.\n\nHe came out with the others at last--the candles and the folded hands\nover the crucifix left behind--and walked as one in a dream. Even by\nthe time that he had gained the outer doorway, and stood blinking at\nthe bright light and filling his lungs with honest air once more, it had\nbegun to seem incredible to him that he had seen and done all this.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nWhile Mr. Ware stood thus on the doorstep, through a minute of\nformless musing, the priest and the girl came out, and, somewhat to his\nconfusion, made him one of their party. He felt himself flushing under\nthe idea that they would think he had waited for them--was thrusting\nhimself upon them. The notion prompted him to bow frigidly in response\nto Father Forbes' pleasant “I am glad to meet you, sir,” and his\noutstretched hand.\n\n“I dropped in by the--the merest accident,” Theron said. “I met them\nbringing the poor man home, and--and quite without thinking, I obeyed\nthe impulse to follow them in, and didn't realize--”\n\nHe stopped short, annoyed by the reflection that this was his second\napology. The girl smiled placidly at him, the while she put up her\nparasol.\n\n“It did me good to see you there,” she said, quite as if she had known\nhim all her life. “And so it did the rest of us.”\n\nFather Forbes permitted himself a soft little chuckle, approving rather\nthan mirthful, and patted her on the shoulder with the air of being\nfifty years her senior instead of fifteen. To the minister's relief, he\nchanged the subject as the three started together toward the road.\n\n“Then, again, no doctor was sent for!” he exclaimed, as if resuming a\nfamiliar subject with the girl. Then he turned to Theron. “I dare-say\nyou have no such trouble; but with our poorer people it is very\nvexing. They will not call in a physician, but hurry off first for the\nclergyman. I don't know that it is altogether to avoid doctor's bills,\nbut it amounts to that in effect. Of course in this case it made no\ndifference; but I have had to make it a rule not to go out at night\nunless they bring me a physician's card with his assurance that it is a\ngenuine affair. Why, only last winter, I was routed up after midnight,\nand brought off in the mud and pelting rain up one of the new streets\non the hillside there, simply because a factory girl who was laced too\ntight had fainted at a dance. I slipped and fell into a puddle in the\ndarkness, ruined a new overcoat, and got drenched to the skin; and when\nI arrived the girl had recovered and was dancing away again, thirteen\nto the dozen. It was then that I made the rule. I hope, Mr. Ware, that\nOctavius is producing a pleasant impression upon you so far?”\n\n“I scarcely know yet,” answered Theron. The genial talk of the priest,\nwith its whimsical anecdote, had in truth passed over his head. His\nmind still had room for nothing but that novel death-bed scene, with\nthe winged captain of the angelic host, the Baptist, the glorified\nFisherman and the Preacher, all being summoned down in the pomp of\nliturgical Latin to help MacEvoy to die. “If you don't mind my saying\nso,” he added hesitatingly, “what I have just seen in there DID make a\nvery powerful impression upon me.”\n\n“It is a very ancient ceremony,” said the priest; “probably Persian,\nlike the baptismal form, although, for that matter, we can never dig\ndeep enough for the roots of these things. They all turn up Turanian if\nwe probe far enough. Our ways separate here, I'm afraid. I am delighted\nto have made your acquaintance, Mr. Ware. Pray look in upon me, if you\ncan as well as not. We are near neighbors, you know.”\n\nFather Forbes had shaken hands, and moved off up another street some\ndistance, before the voice of the girl recalled Theron to himself.\n\n“Of course you knew HIM by name,” she was saying, “and he knew you\nby sight, and had talked of you; but MY poor inferior sex has to be\nintroduced. I am Celia Madden. My father has the wagon-shops, and I--I\nplay the organ at the church.”\n\n“I--I am delighted to make your acquaintance,” said Theron, conscious\nas he spoke that he had slavishly echoed the formula of the priest. He\ncould think of nothing better to add than, “Unfortunately, we have no\norgan in our church.”\n\nThe girl laughed, as they resumed their walk down the street. “I'm\nafraid I couldn't undertake two,” she said, and laughed again. Then she\nspoke more seriously. “That ceremony must have interested you a good\ndeal, never having seen it before. I saw that it was all new to you, and\nso I made bold to take you under my wing, so to speak.”\n\n“You were very kind,” said the young minister. “It was really a great\nexperience for me. May--may I ask, is it a part of your functions, in\nthe church, I mean, to attend these last rites?”\n\n“Mercy, no!” replied the girl, spinning the parasol on her shoulder and\nsmiling at the thought. “No; it was only because MacEvoy was one of our\nworkmen, and really came by his death through father sending him up to\ntrim a tree. Ann MacEvoy will never forgive us that, the longest day she\nlives. Did you notice her? She wouldn't speak to me. After you came out,\nI tried to tell her that we would look out for her and the children; but\nall she would say to me was: 'An' fwat would a wheelwright, an' him the\nfather of a family, be doin' up a tree?'”\n\nThey had come now upon the main street of the village, with its\nflagstone sidewalk overhung by a lofty canopy of elm-boughs. Here, for\nthe space of a block, was concentrated such fashionable elegance of\nmansions and ornamental lawns as Octavius had to offer; and it was\npresented with the irregularity so characteristic of our restless\ncivilization. Two or three of the houses survived untouched from the\nearlier days--prim, decorous structures, each with its gabled centre\nand lower wings, each with its row of fluted columns supporting the\nclassical roof of a piazza across its whole front, each vying with the\nothers in the whiteness of those wooden walls enveloping its bright\ngreen blinds. One had to look over picket fences to see these houses,\nand in doing so caught the notion that they thus railed themselves\noff in pride at being able to remember before the railroad came to the\nvillage, or the wagon-works were thought of.\n\nBefore the neighboring properties the fences had been swept away, so\nthat one might stroll from the sidewalk straight across the well-trimmed\nsward to any one of a dozen elaborately modern doorways. Some of the\nresidences, thus frankly proffering friendship to the passer-by, were of\nwood painted in drabs and dusky reds, with bulging windows which marked\nthe native yearning for the mediaeval, and shingles that strove to be\naccounted tiles. Others--a prouder, less pretentious sort--were of brick\nor stone, with terra-cotta mouldings set into the walls, and with real\nslates covering the riot of turrets and peaks and dormer peepholes\noverhead.\n\nCelia Madden stopped in front of the largest and most important-looking\nof these new edifices, and said, holding out her hand: “Here I am, once\nmore. Good-morning, Mr. Ware.”\n\nTheron hoped that his manner did not betray the flash of surprise he\nfelt in discovering that his new acquaintance lived in the biggest house\nin Octavius. He remembered now that some one had pointed it out as the\nabode of the owner of the wagon factories; but it had not occurred to\nhim before to associate this girl with that village magnate. It was\nstupid of him, of course, because she had herself mentioned her father.\nHe looked at her again with an awkward smile, as he formally shook\nthe gloved hand she gave him, and lifted his soft hat. The strong noon\nsunlight, forcing its way down between the elms, and beating upon her\nparasol of lace-edged, creamy silk, made a halo about her hair and face\nat once brilliant and tender. He had not seen before how beautiful she\nwas. She nodded in recognition of his salute, and moved up the lawn\nwalk, spinning the sunshade on her shoulder.\n\nThough the parsonage was only three blocks away, the young minister had\ntime to think about a good many things before he reached home.\n\nFirst of all, he had to revise in part the arrangement of his notions\nabout the Irish. Save for an occasional isolated and taciturn figure\namong the nomadic portion of the hired help in the farm country, Theron\nhad scarcely ever spoken to a person of this curiously alien race\nbefore. He remembered now that there had been some dozen or more Irish\nfamilies in Tyre, quartered in the outskirts among the brickyards,\nbut he had never come in contact with any of them, or given to their\nexistence even a passing thought. So far as personal acquaintance went,\nthe Irish had been to him only a name.\n\nBut what a sinister and repellent name! His views on this general\nsubject were merely those common to his communion and his environment.\nHe took it for granted, for example, that in the large cities most of\nthe poverty and all the drunkenness, crime, and political corruption\nwere due to the perverse qualities of this foreign people--qualities\naccentuated and emphasized in every evil direction by the baleful\ninfluence of a false and idolatrous religion. It is hardly too much to\nsay that he had never encountered a dissenting opinion on this point.\nHis boyhood had been spent in those bitter days when social, political,\nand blood prejudices were fused at white heat in the public crucible\ntogether. When he went to the Church Seminary, it was a matter of course\nthat every member of the faculty was a Republican, and that every one of\nhis classmates had come from a Republican household. When, later on, he\nentered the ministry, the rule was still incredulous of exceptions. One\nmight as well have looked in the Nedahma Conference for a divergence\nof opinion on the Trinity as for a difference in political conviction.\nIndeed, even among the laity, Theron could not feel sure that he had\never known a Democrat; that is, at all closely. He understood very\nlittle about politics, it is true. If he had been driven into a corner,\nand forced to attempt an explanation of this tremendous partisan unity\nin which he had a share, he would probably have first mentioned\nthe War--the last shots of which were fired while he was still in\npetticoats. Certainly his second reason, however, would have been that\nthe Irish were on the other side.\n\nHe had never before had occasion to formulate, even in his own thoughts,\nthis tacit race and religious aversion in which he had been bred. It\nrose now suddenly in front of him, as he sauntered from patch to patch\nof sunlight under the elms, like some huge, shadowy, and symbolic\nmonument. He looked at it with wondering curiosity, as at something\nhe had heard of all his life, but never seen before--an abhorrent\nspectacle, truly! The foundations upon which its dark bulk reared itself\nwere ignorance, squalor, brutality and vice. Pigs wallowed in the mire\nbefore its base, and burrowing into this base were a myriad of narrow\ndoors, each bearing the hateful sign of a saloon, and giving forth\nfrom its recesses of night the sounds of screams and curses. Above were\nsculptured rows of lowering, ape-like faces from Nast's and Keppler's\ncartoons, and out of these sprang into the vague upper gloom--on the one\nside, lamp-posts from which negroes hung by the neck, and on the other\ngibbets for dynamiters and Molly Maguires, and between the two glowed a\nspectral picture of some black-robed tonsured men, with leering satanic\nmasks, making a bonfire of the Bible in the public schools.\n\nTheron stared this phantasm hard in the face, and recognized it for a\nvery tolerable embodiment of what he had heretofore supposed he thought\nabout the Irish. For an instant, the sight of it made him shiver, as if\nthe sunny May had of a sudden lapsed back into bleak December. Then he\nsmiled, and the bad vision went off into space. He saw instead Father\nForbes, in the white and purple vestments, standing by poor MacEvoy's\nbedside, with his pale, chiselled, luminous, uplifted face, and he\nheard only the proud, confident clanging of the girl's recital,--BEATUM\nMICHAELEM ARCHANGELUM, BEATUM JOANNEM BAPTISTAM, PETRUM ET\nPAULUM--EM!--AM!--UM!--like strokes on a great resonant alarm-bell,\nattuned for the hearing of heaven. He caught himself on the very verge\nof feeling that heaven must have heard.\n\nThen he smiled again, and laid the matter aside, with a parting\nadmission that it had been undoubtedly picturesque and impressive, and\nthat it had been a valuable experience to him to see it. At least the\nIrish, with all their faults, must have a poetic strain, or they would\nnot have clung so tenaciously to those curious and ancient forms. He\nrecalled having heard somewhere, or read, it might be, that they were\na people much given to songs and music. And the young lady, that very\nhandsome and friendly Miss Madden, had told him that she was a musician!\nHe had a new pleasure in turning this over in his mind. Of all the\nclosed doors which his choice of a career had left along his pathway, no\nother had for him such a magical fascination as that on which was graven\nthe lute of Orpheus. He knew not even the alphabet of music, and his\nconceptions of its possibilities ran but little beyond the best of the\nhymn-singing he had heard at Conferences, yet none the less the longing\nfor it raised on occasion such mutiny in his soul that more than once he\nhad specifically prayed against it as a temptation.\n\nDangerous though some of its tendencies might be, there was no\ngainsaying the fact that a love for music was in the main an uplifting\ninfluence--an attribute of cultivation. The world was the sweeter and\nmore gentle for it. And this brought him to musing upon the odd chance\nthat the two people of Octavius who had given him the first notion of\npolish and intellectual culture in the town should be Irish. The Romish\npriest must have been vastly surprised at his intrusion, yet had been\nat the greatest pains to act as if it were quite the usual thing to have\nMethodist ministers assist at Extreme Unction. And the young woman--how\ngracefully, with what delicacy, had she comprehended his position and\nrobbed it of all its possible embarrassments! It occurred to him that\nthey must have passed, there in front of her home, the very tree from\nwhich the luckless wheelwright had fallen some hours before; and the\nfact that she had forborne to point it out to him took form in his mind\nas an added proof of her refinement of nature.\n\nThe midday dinner was a little more than ready when Theron reached home,\nand let himself in by the front door. On Mondays, owing to the moisture\nand “clutter” of the weekly washing in the kitchen, the table was laid\nin the sitting-room, and as he entered from the hall the partner of\nhis joys bustled in by the other door, bearing the steaming platter of\ncorned beef, dumplings, cabbages, and carrots, with arms bared to the\nelbows, and a red face. It gave him great comfort, however, to note that\nthere were no signs of the morning's displeasure remaining on this face;\nand he immediately remembered again those interrupted projects of his\nabout the piano and the hired girl.\n\n“Well! I'd just about begun to reckon that I was a widow,” said Alice,\nputting down her fragrant burden. There was such an obvious suggestion\nof propitiation in her tone that Theron went around and kissed her. He\nthought of saying something about keeping out of the way because it was\n“Blue Monday,” but held it back lest it should sound like a reproach.\n\n“Well, what kind of a washerwoman does THIS one turn out to be?” he\nasked, after they were seated, and he had invoked a blessing and was\ncutting vigorously into the meat.\n\n“Oh, so-so,” replied Alice; “she seems to be particular, but she's\nmortal slow. If I hadn't stood right over her, we shouldn't have had the\nclothes out till goodness knows when. And of course she's Irish!”\n\n“Well, what of THAT?” asked the minister, with a fine unconcern.\n\nAlice looked up from her plate, with knife and fork suspended in air.\n“Why, you know we were talking only the other day of what a pity it was\nthat none of our own people went out washing,” she said. “That Welsh\nwoman we heard of couldn't come, after all; and they say, too, that she\npresumes dreadfully upon the acquaintance, being a church member, you\nknow. So we simply had to fall back on the Irish. And even if they do\ngo and tell their priest everything they see and hear, why, there's one\ncomfort, they can tell about US and welcome. Of course I see to it she\ndoesn't snoop around in here.”\n\nTheron smiled. “That's all nonsense about their telling such things to\ntheir priests,” he said with easy confidence.\n\n“Why, you told me so yourself,” replied Alice, briskly. “And I've always\nunderstood so, too; they're bound to tell EVERYTHING in confession.\nThat's what gives the Catholic Church such a tremendous hold. You've\nspoken of it often.”\n\n“It must have been by way of a figure of speech,” remarked Theron,\nnot with entire directness. “Women are great hands to separate one's\nobservations from their context, and so give them meanings quite\nunintended. They are also great hands,” he added genially, “or at least\none of them is, at making the most delicious dumplings in the world. I\nbelieve these are the best even you ever made.”\n\nAlice was not unmindful of the compliment, but her thoughts were on\nother things. “I shouldn't like that woman's priest, for example,” she\nsaid, “to know that we had no piano.”\n\n“But if he comes and stands outside our house every night and\nlistens--as of course he will,” said Theron, with mock gravity, “it is\nonly a question of time when he must reach that conclusion for himself.\nOur only chance, however, is that there are some sixteen hundred other\nhouses for him to watch, so that he may not get around to us for quite a\nspell. Why, seriously, Alice, what on earth do you suppose Father Forbes\nknows or cares about our poor little affairs, or those of any other\nProtestant household in this whole village? He has his work to do, just\nas I have mine--only his is ten times as exacting in everything except\nsermons--and you may be sure he is only too glad when it is over each\nday, without bothering about things that are none of his business.”\n\n“All the same I'm afraid of them,” said Alice, as if argument were\nexhausted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nOn the following morning young Mr. Ware anticipated events by inscribing\nin his diary for the day, immediately after breakfast, these remarks:\n“Arranged about piano. Began work upon book.”\n\nThe date indeed deserved to be distinguished from its fellows. Theron\nwas so conscious of its importance that he not only prophesied in the\nlittle morocco-bound diary which Alice had given him for Christmas, but\nreturned after he had got out upon the front steps of the parsonage to\nhave his hat brushed afresh by her.\n\n“Wonders will never cease,” she said jocosely. “With you getting\nparticular about your clothes, there isn't anything in this wide world\nthat can't happen now!”\n\n“One doesn't go out to bring home a piano every day,” he made answer.\n“Besides, I want to make such an impression upon the man that he will\ndeal gently with that first cash payment down. Do you know,” he added,\nwatching her turn the felt brim under the wisp-broom's strokes, “I'm\nthinking some of getting me a regular silk stove-pipe hat.”\n\n“Why don't you, then?” she rejoined, but without any ring of glad\nacquiescence in her tone. He fancied that her face lengthened a little,\nand he instantly ascribed it to recollections of the way in which the\nroses had been bullied out of her own headgear.\n\n“You are quite sure, now, pet,” he made haste to change the subject,\n“that the hired girl can wait just as well as not until fall?”\n\n“Oh, MY, yes!” Alice replied, putting the hat on his head, and smoothing\nback his hair behind his ears. “She'd only be in the way now. You see,\nwith hot weather coming on, there won't be much cooking. We'll take all\nour meals out here, and that saves so much work that really what remains\nis hardly more than taking care of a bird-cage. And, besides, not having\nher will almost half pay for the piano.”\n\n“But when cold weather comes, you're sure you'll consent?” he urged.\n\n“Like a shot!” she assured him, and, after a happy little caress, he\nstarted out again on his momentous mission.\n\n“Thurston's” was a place concerning which opinions differed in Octavius.\nThat it typified progress, and helped more than any other feature of the\nvillage to bring it up to date, no one indeed disputed. One might move\nabout a great deal, in truth, and hear no other view expressed. But then\nagain one might stumble into conversation with one small storekeeper\nafter another, and learn that they united in resenting the existence of\n“Thurston's,” as rival farmers might join to curse a protracted drought.\nEach had his special flaming grievance. The little dry-goods dealers\nasked mournfully how they could be expected to compete with an\nestablishment which could buy bankrupt stocks at a hundred different\npoints, and make a profit if only one-third of the articles were sold\nfor more than they would cost from the jobber? The little boot and\nshoe dealers, clothiers, hatters, and furriers, the small merchants in\ncarpets, crockery, and furniture, the venders of hardware and household\nutensils, of leathern goods and picture-frames, of wall-paper, musical\ninstruments, and even toys--all had the same pathetically unanswerable\nquestion to propound. But mostly they put it to themselves, because the\nothers were at “Thurston's.”\n\nThe Rev. Theron Ware had entertained rather strong views on this\nsubject, and that only a week or two ago. One of his first acquaintances\nin Octavius had been the owner of the principal book-store in the\nplace--a gentle and bald old man who produced the complete impression of\na bibliophile upon what the slightest investigation showed to be only a\nmeagre acquaintance with publishers' circulars. But at least he had the\nair of loving his business, and the young minister had enjoyed a long\ntalk with, or rather, at him. Out of this talk had come the information\nthat the store was losing money. Not even the stationery department now\nshowed a profit worth mentioning. When Octavius had contained only five\nthousand inhabitants, it boasted four book-stores, two of them good\nones. Now, with a population more than doubled, only these latter two\nsurvived, and they must soon go to the wall. The reason? It was in a\nnutshell. A book which sold at retail for one dollar and a half cost the\nbookseller ninety cents. If it was at all a popular book, “Thurston's”\n advertised it at eighty-nine cents--and in any case at a profit of only\ntwo or three cents. Of course it was done to widen the establishment's\npatronage--to bring people into the store. Equally of course, it was\ndestroying the book business and debauching the reading tastes of the\ncommunity. Without the profits from the light and ephemeral popular\nliterature of the season, the book-store proper could not keep up its\nstock of more solid works, and indeed could not long keep open at all.\nOn the other hand, “Thurston's” dealt with nothing save the demand of\nthe moment, and offered only the books which were the talk of the week.\nThus, in plain words, the book trade was going to the dogs, and it was\nthe same with pretty nearly every other trade.\n\nTheron was indignant at this, and on his return home told Alice that\nhe desired her to make no purchases whatever at “Thurston's.” He\neven resolved to preach a sermon on the subject of the modern idea of\nadmiring the great for crushing the small, and sketched out some notes\nfor it which he thought solved the problem of flaying the local abuse\nwithout mentioning it by name. They had lain on his desk now for ten\ndays or more, and on only the previous Friday he had speculated upon\nusing them that coming Sunday.\n\nOn this bright and cheerful Tuesday morning he walked with a blithe step\nunhesitatingly down the main street to “Thurston's,” and entered without\nany show of repugnance the door next to the window wherein, flanked\nby dangling banjos and key-bugles built in pyramids, was displayed the\nsign, “Pianos on the Instalment Plan.”\n\nHe was recognized by some responsible persons, and treated with\ndistinguished deference. They were charmed with the intelligence that he\ndesired a piano, and fascinated by his wish to pay for it only a little\nat a time. They had special terms for clergymen, and made him feel as\nif these were being extended to him on a silver charger by kneeling\nadmirers.\n\nIt was so easy to buy things here that he was a trifle disturbed to find\nhis flowing course interrupted by his own entire ignorance as to what\nkind of piano he wanted. He looked at all they had in stock, and heard\nthem played upon. They differed greatly in price, and, so he fancied,\nalmost as much in tone. It discouraged him to note, however, that\nseveral of those he thought the finest in tone were among the very\ncheapest in the lot. Pondering this, and staring in hopeless puzzlement\nfrom one to another of the big black shiny monsters, he suddenly thought\nof something.\n\n“I would rather not decide for myself,” he said, “I know so little about\nit. If you don't mind, I will have a friend of mine, a skilled musician,\nstep in and make a selection. I have so much confidence in--in her\njudgment.” He added hurriedly, “It will involve only a day or two's\ndelay.”\n\nThe next moment he was sorry he had spoken. What would they think when\nthey saw the organist of the Catholic church come to pick out a piano\nfor the Methodist parsonage? And how could he decorously prefer the\nrequest to her to undertake this task? He might not meet her again for\nages, and to his provincial notions writing would have seemed out of the\nquestion. And would it not be disagreeable to have her know that he was\nbuying a piano by part payments? Poor Alice's dread of the washerwoman's\ngossip occurred to him, at this, and he smiled in spite of himself. Then\nall at once the difficulty vanished. Of course it would come all right\nsomehow. Everything did.\n\nHe was on firmer ground, buying the materials for the new book, over\non the stationery side. His original intention had been to bestow this\npatronage upon the old bookseller, but these suavely smart people in\n“Thurston's” had had the effect of putting him on his honor when\nthey asked, “Would there be anything else?” and he had followed them\nunresistingly.\n\nHe indulged to the full his whim that everything entering into the\nconstruction of “Abraham” should be spick-and-span. He watched with his\nown eyes a whole ream of broad glazed white paper being sliced down by\nthe cutter into single sheets, and thrilled with a novel ecstasy as he\nlaid his hand upon the spotless bulk, so wooingly did it invite him to\nbegin. He tried a score of pens before the right one came to hand.\nWhen a box of these had been laid aside, with ink and pen-holders and a\nlittle bronze inkstand, he made a sign that the outfit was complete.\nOr no--there must be some blotting-paper. He had always used those\nblotting-pads given away by insurance companies--his congregations never\nfailed to contain one or more agents, who had these to bestow by the\narmful--but the book deserved a virgin blotter.\n\nTheron stood by while all these things were being tied up together in a\nparcel. The suggestion that they should be sent almost hurt him. Oh,\nno, he would carry them home himself. So strongly did they appeal to his\nsanguine imagination that he could not forbear hinting to the man who\nhad shown him the pianos and was now accompanying him to the door that\nthis package under his arm represented potentially the price of the\npiano he was going to have. He did it in a roundabout way, with one of\nhis droll, hesitating smiles. The man did not understand at all, and\nTheron had not the temerity to repeat the remark. He strode home with\nthe precious bundle as fast as he could.\n\n“I thought it best, after all, not to commit myself to a selection,” he\nexplained about the piano at dinner-time. “In such a matter as this,\nthe opinion of an expert is everything. I am going to have one of the\nprincipal musicians of the town go and try them all, and tell me which\nwe ought to have.”\n\n“And while he's about it,” said Alice, “you might ask him to make a\nlittle list of some of the new music. I've got way behind the times,\nbeing without a piano so long. Tell him not any VERY difficult pieces,\nyou know.”\n\n“Yes, I know,” put in Theron, almost hastily, and began talking of other\nthings. His conversation was of the most rambling and desultory sort,\nbecause all the while the two lobes of his brain, as it were, kept up a\ndispute as to whether Alice ought to have been told that this “principal\nmusician” was of her own sex. It would certainly have been better, at\nthe outset, he decided; but to mention it now would be to invest the\nfact with undue importance. Yes, that was quite clear; only the clearer\nit became, from one point of view, the shadier it waxed from the other.\nThe problem really disturbed the young minister's mind throughout\nthe meal, and his abstraction became so marked at last that his wife\ncommented upon it.\n\n“A penny for your thoughts!” she said, with cheerful briskness. This\nancient formula of the farm-land had always rather jarred on Theron. It\npresented itself now to his mind as a peculiarly aggravating banality.\n\n“I am going to begin my book this afternoon,” he remarked impressively.\n“There is a great deal to think about.”\n\nIt turned out that there was even more to think about than he had\nimagined. After hours of solitary musing at his desk, or of pacing up\nand down before his open book-shelves, Theron found the first shadows of\na May-day twilight beginning to fall upon that beautiful pile of white\npaper, still unstained by ink. He saw the book he wanted to write before\nhim, in his mental vision, much more distinctly than ever, but the idea\nof beginning it impetuously, and hurling it off hot and glowing week by\nweek, had faded away like a dream.\n\nThis long afternoon, spent face to face with a project born of his own\nbrain but yesterday, yet already so much bigger than himself, was really\na most fruitful time for the young clergyman. The lessons which cut\nmost deeply into our consciousness are those we learn from our children.\nTheron, in this first day's contact with the offspring of his fancy,\nfound revealed to him an unsuspected and staggering truth. It was that\nhe was an extremely ignorant and rudely untrained young man, whose\npretensions to intellectual authority among any educated people would be\nlaughed at with deserved contempt.\n\nStrangely enough, after he had weathered the first shock, this discovery\ndid not dismay Theron Ware. The very completeness of the conviction it\ncarried with it, saturated his mind with a feeling as if the fact had\nreally been known to him all along. And there came, too, after a little,\nan almost pleasurable sense of the importance of the revelation. He had\nbeen merely drifting in fatuous and conceited blindness. Now all at once\nhis eyes were open; he knew what he had to do. Ignorance was a thing to\nbe remedied, and he would forthwith bend all his energies to cultivating\nhis mind till it should blossom like a garden. In this mood, Theron\nmentally measured himself against the more conspicuous of his colleagues\nin the Conference. They also were ignorant, clownishly ignorant: the\ndifference was that they were doomed by native incapacity to go on all\ntheir lives without ever finding it out. It was obvious to him that his\ncase was better. There was bright promise in the very fact that he had\ndiscovered his shortcomings.\n\nHe had begun the afternoon by taking down from their places the various\nworks in his meagre library which bore more or less relation to the task\nin hand. The threescore books which constituted his printed possessions\nwere almost wholly from the press of the Book Concern; the few\nexceptions were volumes which, though published elsewhere, had come to\nhim through that giant circulating agency of the General Conference,\nand wore the stamp of its approval. Perhaps it was the sight of these\nhalf-filled shelves which started this day's great revolution in\nTheron's opinions of himself. He had never thought much before about\nowning books. He had been too poor to buy many, and the conditions of\ncanvassing about among one's parishioners which the thrifty Book Concern\nimposes upon those who would have without buying, had always repelled\nhim. Now, suddenly, as he moved along the two shelves, he felt ashamed\nat their beggarly showing.\n\n“The Land and the Book,” in three portly volumes, was the most\npretentious of the aids which he finally culled from his collection.\nBeside it he laid out “Bible Lands,” “Rivers and Lakes of Scripture,”\n “Bible Manners and Customs,” the “Genesis and Exodus” volume of Whedon's\nCommentary, some old numbers of the “Methodist Quarterly Review,” and a\ncopy of “Josephus” which had belonged to his grandmother, and had\nseen him through many a weary Sunday afternoon in boyhood. He glanced\ncasually through these, one by one, as he took them down, and began to\nfear that they were not going to be of so much use as he had thought.\nThen, seating himself, he read carefully through the thirteen chapters\nof Genesis which chronicle the story of the founder of Israel.\n\nOf course he had known this story from his earliest years. In almost\nevery chapter he came now upon a phrase or an incident which had served\nhim as the basis for a sermon. He had preached about Hagar in the\nwilderness, about Lot's wife, about the visit of the angels, about the\nintended sacrifice of Isaac, about a dozen other things suggested by the\nancient narrative. Somehow this time it all seemed different to him.\nThe people he read about were altered to his vision. Heretofore a poetic\nlight had shone about them, where indeed they had not glowed in a halo\nof sanctification. Now, by some chance, this light was gone, and he saw\nthem instead as untutored and unwashed barbarians, filled with animal\nlusts and ferocities, struggling by violence and foul chicanery to\nsecure a foothold in a country which did not belong to them--all rude\ntramps and robbers of the uncivilized plain.\n\nThe apparent fact that Abram was a Chaldean struck him with peculiar\nforce. How was it, he wondered, that this had never occurred to him\nbefore? Examining himself, he found that he had supposed vaguely that\nthere had been Jews from the beginning, or at least, say, from the\nflood. But, no, Abram was introduced simply as a citizen of the Chaldean\ntown of Ur, and there was no hint of any difference in race between him\nand his neighbors. It was specially mentioned that his brother, Lot's\nfather, died in Ur, the city of his nativity. Evidently the family\nbelonged there, and were Chaldeans like the rest.\n\nI do not cite this as at all a striking discovery, but it did have a\ncurious effect upon Theron Ware. Up to that very afternoon, his notion\nof the kind of book he wanted to write had been founded upon a popular\nbook called “Ruth the Moabitess,” written by a clergyman he knew very\nwell, the Rev. E. Ray Mifflin. This model performance troubled itself\nnot at all with difficult points, but went swimmingly along through\nscented summer seas of pretty rhetoric, teaching nothing, it is true,\nbut pleasing a good deal and selling like hot cakes. Now, all at once\nTheron felt that he hated that sort of book. HIS work should be of a\nvastly different order. He might fairly assume, he thought, that if the\nfact that Abram was a Chaldean was new to him, it would fall upon the\nworld in general as a novelty. Very well, then, there was his chance.\nHe would write a learned book, showing who the Chaldeans were, and how\ntheir manners and beliefs differed from, and influenced--\n\nIt was at this psychological instant that the wave of self-condemnation\nsuddenly burst upon and submerged the young clergyman. It passed again,\nleaving him staring fixedly at the pile of books he had taken down from\nthe shelves, and gasping a little, as if for breath. Then the humorous\nside of the thing, perversely enough, appealed to him, and he grinned\nfeebly to himself at the joke of his having imagined that he could write\nlearnedly about the Chaldeans, or anything else. But, no, it shouldn't\nremain a joke! His long mobile face grew serious under the new resolve.\nHe would learn what there was to be learned about the Chaldeans. He rose\nand walked up and down the room, gathering fresh strength of purpose\nas this inviting field of research spread out its vistas before him.\nPerhaps--yes, he would incidentally explore the mysteries of the\nMoabitic past as well, and thus put the Rev. E. Ray Mifflin to confusion\non his own subject. That would in itself be a useful thing, because\nMifflin wore kid gloves at the Conference, and affected an intolerable\nsuperiority of dress and demeanor, and there would be general\nsatisfaction among the plainer and worthier brethren at seeing him taken\ndown a peg.\n\nNow for the first time there rose distinctly in Theron's mind that\ncasual allusion which Father Forbes had made to the Turanians. He\nrecalled, too, his momentary feeling of mortification at not knowing who\nthe Turanians were, at the time. Possibly, if he had probed this matter\nmore deeply, now as he walked and pondered in the little living-room,\nhe might have traced the whole of the afternoon's mental experiences to\nthat chance remark of the Romish priest. But this speculation did not\ndetain him. He mused instead upon the splendid library Father Forbes\nmust have.\n\n“Well, how does the book come on? Have you got to 'my Lady Keturah'\nyet?'”\n\nIt was Alice who spoke, opening the door from the kitchen, and putting\nin her head with a pretence of great and solemn caution, but with a\ncorrecting twinkle in her eyes.\n\n“I haven't got to anybody yet,” answered Theron, absently. “These big\nthings must be approached slowly.”\n\n“Come out to supper, then, while the beans are hot,” said Alice.\n\nThe young minister sat through this other meal, again in deep\nabstraction. His wife pursued her little pleasantry about Keturah,\nthe second wife, urging him with mock gravity to scold her roundly for\ndaring to usurp Sarah's place, but Theron scarcely heard her, and said\nnext to nothing. He ate sparingly, and fidgeted in his seat, waiting\nwith obvious impatience for the finish of the meal. At last he rose\nabruptly.\n\n“I've got a call to make--something with reference to the book,” he\nsaid. “I'll run out now, I think, before it gets dark.”\n\nHe put on his hat, and strode out of the house as if his errand was of\nthe utmost urgency. Once upon the street, however, his pace slackened.\nThere was still a good deal of daylight outside, and he loitered\naimlessly about, walking with bowed head and hands clasped behind him,\nuntil dusk fell. Then he squared his shoulders, and started straight as\nthe crow flies toward the residence of Father Forbes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nThe new Catholic church was the largest and most imposing public\nbuilding in Octavius. Even in its unfinished condition, with a bald\nroofing of weather-beaten boards marking on the stunted tower the place\nwhere a spire was to begin later on, it dwarfed every other edifice of\nthe sort in the town, just as it put them all to shame in the matter of\nthe throngs it drew, rain or shine, to its services.\n\nThese facts had not heretofore been a source of satisfaction to the Rev.\nTheron Ware. He had even alluded to the subject in terms which gave his\nwife the impression that he actively deplored the strength and size of\nthe Catholic denomination in this new home of theirs, and was troubled\nin his mind about Rome generally. But this evening he walked along\nthe extended side of the big structure, which occupied nearly half the\nblock, and then, turning the corner, passed in review its wide-doored,\nlooming front, without any hostile emotions whatever. In the gathering\ndusk it seemed more massive than ever before, but he found himself only\npassively considering the odd statement he had heard that all Catholic\nChurch property was deeded absolutely in the name of the Bishop of the\ndiocese.\n\nOnly a narrow passage-way separated the church from the pastorate--a\nfine new brick residence standing flush upon the street. Theron mounted\nthe steps, and looked about for a bell-pull. Search revealed instead a\nlittle ivory button set in a ring of metal work. He picked at this for\na time with his finger-nail, before he made out the injunction, printed\nacross it, to push. Of course! how stupid of him! This was one of those\nelectric bells he had heard so much of, but which had not as yet made\ntheir way to the class of homes he knew. For custodians of a mediaeval\nsuperstition and fanaticism, the Catholic clergy seemed very much up to\ndate. This bell made him feel rather more a countryman than ever.\n\nThe door was opened by a tall gaunt woman, who stood in black relief\nagainst the radiance of the hall-way while Theron, choosing his words\nwith some diffidence, asked if the Rev. Mr. Forbes was in.\n\n“He is” came the hush-voiced answer. “He's at dinner, though.”\n\nIt took the young minister a second or two to bring into association in\nhis mind this evening hour and this midday meal. Then he began to say\nthat he would call again--it was nothing special--but the woman suddenly\ncut him short by throwing the door wide open.\n\n“It's Mr. Ware, is it not?” she asked, in a greatly altered tone. “Sure,\nhe'd not have you go away. Come inside--do, sir!--I'll tell him.”\n\nTheron, with a dumb show of reluctance, crossed the threshold. He noted\nnow that the woman, who had bustled down the hall on her errand, was\ngray-haired and incredibly ugly, with a dark sour face, glowering black\neyes, and a twisted mouth. Then he saw that he was not alone in the\nhall-way. Three men and two women, all poorly clad and obviously working\npeople, were seated in meek silence on a bench beyond the hat-rack. They\nglanced up at him for an instant, then resumed their patient study of\nthe linoleum pattern on the floor at their feet.\n\n“And will you kindly step in, sir?” the elderly Gorgon had returned to\nask. She led Mr. Ware along the hall-way to a door near the end, and\nopened it for him to pass before her.\n\nHe entered a room in which for the moment he could see nothing but a\ncentral glare of dazzling light beating down from a great shaded\nlamp upon a circular patch of white table linen. Inside this ring of\nillumination points of fire sparkled from silver and porcelain, and two\nbars of burning crimson tracked across the cloth in reflection from tall\nglasses filled with wine. The rest of the room was vague darkness; but\nthe gloom seemed saturated with novel aromatic odors, the appetizing\nscent of which bore clear relation to what Theron's blinking eyes rested\nupon.\n\nHe was able now to discern two figures at the table, outside the glowing\ncircle of the lamp. They had both risen, and one came toward him with\ncordial celerity, holding out a white plump hand in greeting. He took\nthis proffered hand rather limply, not wholly sure in the half-light\nthat this really was Father Forbes, and began once more that everlasting\napology to which he seemed doomed in the presence of the priest. It was\nbroken abruptly off by the other's protesting laughter.\n\n“My dear Mr. Ware, I beg of you,” the priest urged, chuckling with\nhospitable mirth, “don't, don't apologize! I give you my word, nothing\nin the world could have pleased us better than your joining us here\ntonight. It was quite dramatic, your coming in as you did. We were\nspeaking of you at that very moment. Oh, I forgot--let me make you\nacquainted with my friend--my very particular friend, Dr. Ledsmar. Let\nme take your hat; pray draw up a chair. Maggie will have a place laid\nfor you in a minute.”\n\n“Oh, I assure you--I couldn't think of it--I've just eaten\nmy--my--dinner,” expostulated Theron. He murmured more inarticulate\nremonstrances a moment later, when the grim old domestic appeared with\nplates, serviette, and tableware for his use, but she went on spreading\nthem before him as if she heard nothing. Thus committed against a decent\nshow of resistance, the young minister did eat a little here and there\nof what was set before him, and was human enough to regret frankly\nthat he could not eat more. It seemed to him very remarkable cookery,\ntransfiguring so simple a thing as a steak, for example, quite out of\nrecognition, and investing the humble potato with a charm he had never\ndreamed of. He wondered from time to time if it would be polite to ask\nhow the potatoes were cooked, so that he might tell Alice.\n\nThe conversation at the table was not continuous, or even enlivened.\nAfter the lapses into silence became marked, Theron began to suspect\nthat his refusal to drink wine had annoyed them--the more so as he had\ndrenched a large section of table-cloth in his efforts to manipulate a\nsiphon instead. He was greatly relieved, therefore, when Father Forbes\nexplained in an incidental way that Dr. Ledsmar and he customarily ate\ntheir meals almost without a word.\n\n“It's a philosophic fad of his,” the priest went on smilingly, “and I\nhave fallen in with it for the sake of a quiet life; so that when we do\nhave company--that is to say, once in a blue moon--we display no manners\nto speak of.”\n\n“I had always supposed--that is, I've always heard--that it was more\nhealthful to talk at meals,” said Theron. “Of course--what I mean--I\ntook it for granted all physicians thought so.”\n\nDr. Ledsmar laughed. “That depends so much upon the quality of the\nmeals!” he remarked, holding his glass up to the light.\n\nHe seemed a man of middle age and an equable disposition. Theron,\nstealing stray glances at him around the lampshade, saw most distinctly\nof all a broad, impressive dome of skull, which, though obviously the\nresult of baldness, gave the effect of quite belonging to the face.\nThere were gold-rimmed spectacles, through which shone now and again the\nvivid sparkle of sharp, alert eyes, and there was a nose of some sort\nnot easy to classify, at once long and thick. The rest was thin hair and\nshort round beard, mouse-colored where the light caught them, but losing\ntheir outlines in the shadows of the background. Theron had not heard of\nhim among the physicians of Octavius. He wondered if he might not be a\ndoctor of something else than medicine, and decided upon venturing the\nquestion.\n\n“Oh, yes, it is medicine,” replied Ledsmar. “I am a doctor three or four\ntimes over, so far as parchments can make one. In some other respects,\nthough, I should think I am probably less of a doctor than anybody else\nnow living. I haven't practised--that is, regularly--for many years, and\nI take no interest whatever in keeping abreast of what the profession\nregards as its progress. I know nothing beyond what was being taught in\nthe sixties, and that I am glad to say I have mostly forgotten.”\n\n“Dear me!” said Theron. “I had always supposed that Science was the most\nengrossing of pursuits--that once a man took it up he never left it.”\n\n“But that would imply a connection between Science and Medicine!”\n commented the doctor. “My dear sir, they are not even on speaking\nterms.”\n\n“Shall we go upstairs?” put in the priest, rising from his chair. “It\nwill be more comfortable to have our coffee there--unless indeed, Mr.\nWare, tobacco is unpleasant to you?”\n\n“Oh, my, no!” the young minister exclaimed, eager to free himself from\nthe suggestion of being a kill-joy. “I don't smoke myself; but I am very\nfond of the odor, I assure you.”\n\nFather Forbes led the way out. It could be seen now that he wore a long\nhouse-gown of black silk, skilfully moulded to his erect, shapely, and\nrounded form. Though he carried this with the natural grace of a proud\nand beautiful belle, there was no hint of the feminine in his bearing,\nor in the contour of his pale, firm-set, handsome face. As he moved\nthrough the hall-way, the five people whom Theron had seen waiting rose\nfrom their bench, and two of the women began in humble murmurs, “If you\nplease, Father,” and “Good-evening to your Riverence;” but the priest\nmerely nodded and passed on up the staircase, followed by his guests.\nThe people sat down on their bench again.\n\nA few minutes later, reclining at his ease in a huge low chair, and\nfeeling himself unaccountably at home in the most luxuriously appointed\nand delightful little room he had ever seen, the Rev. Theron Ware sipped\nhis unaccustomed coffee and embarked upon an explanation of his errand.\nSomehow the very profusion of scholarly symbols about him--the great\ndark rows of encased and crowded book-shelves rising to the ceiling,\nthe classical engravings upon the wall, the revolving book-case, the\nreading-stand, the mass of littered magazines, reviews, and papers at\neither end of the costly and elaborate writing-desk--seemed to make\nit the easier for him to explain without reproach that he needed\ninformation about Abram. He told them quite in detail the story of his\nbook.\n\nThe two others sat watching him through a faint haze of scented smoke,\nwith polite encouragement on their faces. Father Forbes took the added\ntrouble to nod understandingly at the various points of the narrative,\nand when it was finished gave one of his little approving chuckles.\n\n“This skirts very closely upon sorcery,” he said smilingly. “Do\nyou know, there is perhaps not another man in the country who knows\nAssyriology so thoroughly as our friend here, Dr. Ledsmar.”\n\n“That's putting it too strong,” remarked the Doctor. “I only follow at\na distance--a year or two behind. But I daresay I can help you. You are\nquite welcome to anything I have: my books cover the ground pretty well\nup to last year. Delitzsch is very interesting; but Baudissin's 'Studien\nzur Semitischen Religionsgeschichte' would come closer to what you need.\nThere are several other important Germans--Schrader, Bunsen, Duncker,\nHommel, and so on.”\n\n“Unluckily I--I don't read German readily,” Theron explained with\ndiffidence.\n\n“That's a pity,” said the doctor, “because they do the best work--not\nonly in this field, but in most others. And they do so much that the\nmass defies translation. Well, the best thing outside of German of\ncourse is Sayce. I daresay you know him, though.”\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Ware shook his head mournfully. “I don't seem to know any\none,” he murmured.\n\nThe others exchanged glances.\n\n“But if I may ask, Mr. Ware,” pursued the doctor, regarding their guest\nwith interest through his spectacles, “why do you specially hit upon\nAbraham? He is full of difficulties--enough, just now, at any rate, to\nwarn off the bravest scholar. Why not take something easier?”\n\nTheron had recovered something of his confidence. “Oh, no,” he said,\n“that is just what attracts me to Abraham. I like the complexities and\ncontradictions in his character. Take for instance all that strange\nand picturesque episode of Hagar: see the splendid contrast between the\ncraft and commercial guile of his dealings in Egypt and with Abimelech,\nand the simple, straightforward godliness of his later years. No, all\nthose difficulties only attract me. Do you happen to know--of course\nyou would know--do those German books, or the others, give anywhere any\nadditional details of the man himself and his sayings and doings--little\nthings which help, you know, to round out one's conception of the\nindividual?”\n\nAgain the priest and the doctor stole a furtive glance across the young\nminister's head. It was Father Forbes who replied.\n\n“I fear that you are taking our friend Abraham too literally, Mr. Ware,”\n he said, in that gentle semblance of paternal tones which seemed to go\nso well with his gown. “Modern research, you know, quite wipes him out\nof existence as an individual. The word 'Abram' is merely an eponym--it\nmeans 'exalted father.' Practically all the names in the Genesis\nchronologies are what we call eponymous. Abram is not a person at all:\nhe is a tribe, a sept, a clan. In the same way, Shem is not intended for\na man; it is the name of a great division of the human race. Heber is\nsimply the throwing back into allegorical substance, so to speak, of the\nHebrews; Heth of the Hittites; Asshur of Assyria.”\n\n“But this is something very new, this theory, isn't it?” queried Theron.\n\nThe priest smiled and shook his head. “Bless you, no! My dear sir, there\nis nothing new. Epicurus and Lucretius outlined the whole Darwinian\ntheory more than two thousand years ago. As for this eponym thing, why\nSaint Augustine called attention to it fifteen hundred years ago. In\nhis 'De Civitate Dei,' he expressly says of these genealogical names,\n'GENTES NON HOMINES;' that is, 'peoples, not persons.' It was as obvious\nto him--as much a commonplace of knowledge--as it was to Ezekiel eight\nhundred years before him.”\n\n“It seems passing strange that we should not know it now, then,”\n commented Theron; “I mean, that everybody shouldn't know it.”\n\nFather Forbes gave a little purring chuckle. “Ah, there we get upon\ncontentious ground,” he remarked. “Why should 'everybody' be supposed\nto know anything at all? What business is it of 'everybody's' to know\nthings? The earth was just as round in the days when people supposed it\nto be flat, as it is now. So the truth remains always the truth, even\nthough you give a charter to ten hundred thousand separate numskulls to\nexamine it by the light of their private judgment, and report that it is\nas many different varieties of something else. But of course that whole\nquestion of private judgment versus authority is No-Man's-Land for us.\nWe were speaking of eponyms.”\n\n“Yes,” said Theron; “it is very interesting.”\n\n“There is a curious phase of the subject which hasn't been worked out\nmuch,” continued the priest. “Probably the Germans will get at that too,\nsometime. They are doing the best Irish work in other fields, as it is.\nI spoke of Heber and Heth, in Genesis, as meaning the Hebrews and the\nHittites. Now my own people, the Irish, have far more ancient legends\nand traditions than any other nation west of Athens; and you find in\ntheir myth of the Milesian invasion and conquest two principal leaders\ncalled Heber and Ith, or Heth. That is supposed to be comparatively\nmodern--about the time of Solomon's Temple. But these independent Irish\nmyths go back to the fall of the Tower of Babel, and they have there an\nancestor, grandson of Japhet, named Fenius Farsa, and they ascribe\nto him the invention of the alphabet. They took their ancient name of\nFeine, the modern Fenian, from him. Oddly enough, that is the name which\nthe Romans knew the Phoenicians by, and to them also is ascribed the\ninvention of the alphabet. The Irish have a holy salmon of knowledge,\njust like the Chaldean man-fish. The Druids' tree-worship is identical\nwith that of the Chaldeans--those pagan groves, you know, which the Jews\nwere always being punished for building. You see, there is nothing new.\nEverything is built on the ruins of something else. Just as the material\nearth is made up of countless billions of dead men's bones, so the\nmental world is all alive with the ghosts of dead men's thoughts and\nbeliefs, the wraiths of dead races' faiths and imaginings.”\n\nFather Forbes paused, then added with a twinkle in his eye: “That\nperoration is from an old sermon of mine, in the days when I used to\npreach. I remember rather liking it, at the time.”\n\n“But you still preach?” asked the Rev. Mr. Ware, with lifted brows.\n\n“No! no more! I only talk now and again,” answered the priest, with what\nseemed a suggestion of curtness. He made haste to take the conversation\nback again. “The names of these dead-and-gone things are singularly\npertinacious, though. They survive indefinitely. Take the modern name\nMarmaduke, for example. It strikes one as peculiarly modern, up-to-date,\ndoesn't it? Well, it is the oldest name on earth--thousands of years\nolder than Adam. It is the ancient Chaldean Meridug, or Merodach. He was\nthe young god who interceded continually between the angry, omnipotent\nEa, his father, and the humble and unhappy Damkina, or Earth, who was\nhis mother. This is interesting from another point of view, because\nthis Merodach or Marmaduke is, so far as we can see now, the original\nprototype of our 'divine intermediary' idea. I daresay, though, that if\nwe could go back still other scores of centuries, we should find whole\nreceding series of types of this Christ-myth of ours.”\n\nTheron Ware sat upright at the fall of these words, and flung a\nswift, startled look about the room--the instinctive glance of a man\nunexpectedly confronted with peril, and casting desperately about for\nmeans of defence and escape. For the instant his mind was aflame with\nthis vivid impression--that he was among sinister enemies, at the mercy\nof criminals. He half rose under the impelling stress of this feeling,\nwith the sweat standing on his brow, and his jaw dropped in a scared and\nbewildered stare.\n\nThen, quite as suddenly, the sense of shock was gone; and it was as if\nnothing at all had happened. He drew a long breath, took another sip of\nhis coffee, and found himself all at once reflecting almost pleasurably\nupon the charm of contact with really educated people. He leaned back in\nthe big chair again, and smiled to show these men of the world how much\nat his ease he was. It required an effort, he discovered, but he made it\nbravely, and hoped he was succeeding.\n\n“It hasn't been in my power to at all lay hold of what the world keeps\non learning nowadays about its babyhood,” he said. “All I have done is\nto try to preserve an open mind, and to maintain my faith that the more\nwe know, the nearer we shall approach the Throne.”\n\nDr. Ledsmar abruptly scuffled his feet on the floor, and took out his\nwatch. “I'm afraid--” he began.\n\n“No, no! There's plenty of time,” remarked the priest, with his soft\nhalf-smile and purring tones. “You finish your cigar here with Mr. Ware,\nand excuse me while I run down and get rid of the people in the hall.”\n\nFather Forbes tossed his cigar-end into the fender. Then he took from\nthe mantel a strange three-cornered black-velvet cap, with a dangling\nsilk tassel at the side, put it on his head, and went out.\n\nTheron, being left alone with the doctor, hardly knew what to do or say.\nHe took up a paper from the floor beside him, but realized that it would\nbe impolite to go farther, and laid it on his knee. Some trace of that\nearlier momentary feeling that he was in hostile hands came back, and\nworried him. He lifted himself upright in the chair, and then became\nconscious that what really disturbed him was the fact that Dr. Ledsmar\nhad turned in his seat, crossed his legs, and was contemplating him with\na gravely concentrated scrutiny through his spectacles.\n\nThis uncomfortable gaze kept itself up a long way beyond the point of\ngood manners; but the doctor seemed not to mind that at all.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nWhen Dr. Ledsmar finally spoke, it was in a kindlier tone than the\nyoung minister had looked for. “I had half a notion of going to hear\nyou preach the other evening,” he said; “but at the last minute I backed\nout. I daresay I shall pluck up the courage, sooner or later, and really\ngo. It must be fully twenty years since I last heard a sermon, and I had\nsupposed that that would suffice for the rest of my life. But they\ntell me that you are worth while; and, for some reason or other, I find\nmyself curious on the subject.”\n\nInvolved and dubious though the compliment might be, Theron felt himself\nflushing with satisfaction. He nodded his acknowledgment, and changed\nthe topic.\n\n“I was surprised to hear Father Forbes say that he did not preach,” he\nremarked.\n\n“Why should he?” asked the doctor, indifferently. “I suppose he hasn't\nmore than fifteen parishioners in a thousand who would understand him\nif he did, and of these probably twelve would join in a complaint to his\nBishop about the heterodox tone of his sermon. There is no point in his\ngoing to all that pains, merely to incur that risk. Nobody wants him to\npreach, and he has reached an age where personal vanity no longer tempts\nhim to do so. What IS wanted of him is that he should be the paternal,\nceremonial, authoritative head and centre of his flock, adviser,\nmonitor, overseer, elder brother, friend, patron, seigneur--whatever you\nlike--everything except a bore. They draw the line at that. You see how\ndiametrically opposed this Catholic point of view is to the Protestant.”\n\n“The difference does seem extremely curious to me,” said Theron. “Now,\nthose people in the hall--”\n\n“Go on,” put in the doctor, as the other faltered hesitatingly. “I know\nwhat you were going to say. It struck you as odd that he should let them\nwait on the bench there, while he came up here to smoke.”\n\nTheron smiled faintly. “I WAS thinking that my--my parishioners wouldn't\nhave taken it so quietly. But of course--it is all so different!”\n\n“As chalk from cheese!” said Dr. Ledsmar, lighting a fresh cigar. “I\ndaresay every one you saw there had come either to take the pledge, or\nsee to it that one of the others took it. That is the chief industry\nin the hall, so far as I have observed. Now discipline is an important\nelement in the machinery here. Coming to take the pledge implies that\nyou have been drunk and are now ashamed. Both states have their values,\nbut they are opposed. Sitting on that bench tends to develop penitence\nto the prejudice of alcoholism. But at no stage would it ever occur to\nthe occupant of the bench that he was the best judge of how long he was\nto sit there, or that his priest should interrupt his dinner or general\npersonal routine, in order to administer that pledge. Now, I daresay you\nhave no people at all coming to 'swear off.'”\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Ware shook his head. “No; if a man with us got as bad as\nall that, he wouldn't come near the church at all. He'd simply drop out,\nand there would be an end to it.”\n\n“Quite so,” interjected the doctor. “That is the voluntary system. But\nthese fellows can't drop out. There's no bottom to the Catholic Church.\nEverything that's in, stays in. If you don't mind my saying so--of\ncourse I view you all impartially from the outside--but it seems logical\nto me that a church should exist for those who need its help, and not\nfor those who by their own profession are so good already that it is\nthey who help the church. Now, you turn a man out of your church who\nbehaves badly: that must be on the theory that his remaining in would\ninjure the church, and that in turn involves the idea that it is the\nexcellent character of the parishioners which imparts virtue to the\nchurch. The Catholics' conception, you see, is quite the converse. Such\nvirtue as they keep in stock is on tap, so to speak, here in the church\nitself, and the parishioners come and get some for themselves according\nto their need for it. Some come every day, some only once a year, some\nperhaps never between their baptism and their funeral. But they all\nhave a right here, the professional burglar every whit as much as the\nspeckless saint. The only stipulation is that they oughtn't to come\nunder false pretences: the burglar is in honor bound not to pass himself\noff to his priest as the saint. But that is merely a moral obligation,\nestablished in the burglar's own interest. It does him no good to come\nunless he feels that he is playing the rules of the game, and one of\nthese is confession. If he cheats there, he knows that he is cheating\nnobody but himself, and might much better have stopped away altogether.”\n\nTheron nodded his head comprehendingly. He had a great many views about\nthe Romanish rite of confession which did not at all square with this\nstatement of the case, but this did not seem a specially fit time for\nbringing them forth. There was indeed a sense of languid repletion in\nhis mind, as if it had been overfed and wanted to lie down for awhile.\nHe contented himself with nodding again, and murmuring reflectively,\n“Yes, it is all strangely different.”\n\nHis tone was an invitation to silence; and the doctor turned his\nattention to the cigar, studying its ash for a minute with an air\nof deep meditation, and then solemnly blowing out a slow series of\nsmoke-rings. Theron watched him with an indolent, placid eye, wondering\nlazily if it was, after all, so very pleasant to smoke.\n\nThere fell upon this silence--with a softness so delicate that it came\nalmost like a progression in the hush--the sound of sweet music. For a\nlittle, strain and source were alike indefinite--an impalpable setting\nto harmony of the mellowed light, the perfumed opalescence of the air,\nthe luxury and charm of the room. Then it rose as by a sweeping curve of\nbeauty, into a firm, calm, severe melody, delicious to the ear, but as\ncold in the mind's vision as moonlit sculpture. It went on upward with\nstately collectedness of power, till the atmosphere seemed all alive\nwith the trembling consciousness of the presence of lofty souls, sternly\npure and pitilessly great.\n\nTheron found himself moved as he had never been before. He almost\nresented the discovery, when it was presented to him by the prosaic,\nmechanical side of his brain, that he was listening to organ-music, and\nthat it came through the open window from the church close by. He would\nfain have reclined in his chair and closed his eyes, and saturated\nhimself with the uttermost fulness of the sensation. Yet, in absurd\ndespite of himself, he rose and moved over to the window.\n\nOnly a narrow alley separated the pastorate from the church; Mr. Ware\ncould have touched with a walking-stick the opposite wall. Indirectly\nfacing him was the arched and mullioned top of a great window. A dim\nlight from within shone through the more translucent portions of the\nglass below, throwing out faint little bars of party-colored radiance\nupon the blackness of the deep passage-way. He could vaguely trace by\nthese the outlines of some sort of picture on the window. There were\nhuman figures in it, and--yes--up here in the centre, nearest him, was a\nwoman's head. There was a halo about it, engirdling rich, flowing waves\nof reddish hair, the lights in which glowed like flame. The face itself\nwas barely distinguishable, but its half-suggested form raised a curious\nsense of resemblance to some other face. He looked at it closely,\nblankly, the noble music throbbing through his brain meanwhile.\n\n“It's that Madden girl!” he suddenly heard a voice say by his side. Dr.\nLedsmar had followed him to the window, and was close at his shoulder.\n\nTheron's thoughts were upon the puzzling shadowed lineaments on the\nstained glass. He saw now in a flash the resemblance which had baffled\nhim. “It IS like her, of course,” he said.\n\n“Yes, unfortunately, it IS just like her,” replied the doctor, with a\nhostile note in his voice. “Whenever I am dining here, she always goes\nin and kicks up that racket. She knows I hate it.”\n\n“Oh, you mean that it is she who is playing,” remarked Theron. “I\nthought you referred to--at least--I was thinking of--”\n\nHis sentence died off in inconsequence. He had a feeling that he did not\nwant to talk with the doctor about the stained-glass likeness. The music\nhad sunk away now into fragmentary and unconnected passages, broken here\nand there by abrupt stops. Dr. Ledsmar stretched an arm out past him and\nshut the window. “Let's hear as little of the row as we can,” he said,\nand the two went back to their chairs.\n\n“Pardon me for the question,” the Rev. Mr. Ware said, after a pause\nwhich began to affect him as constrained, “but something you said about\ndining--you don't live here, then? In the house, I mean?”\n\nThe doctor laughed--a characteristically abrupt, dry little laugh, which\nstruck Theron at once as bearing a sort of black-sheep relationship\nto the priest's habitual chuckle. “That must have been puzzling you no\nend,” he said--“that notion that the pastorate kept a devil's advocate\non the premises. No, Mr. Ware, I don't live here. I inhabit a house\nof my own--you may have seen it--an old-fashioned place up beyond the\nrace-course, with a sort of tower at the back, and a big garden. But I\ndine here three or four times a week. It is an old arrangement of ours.\nVincent and I have been friends for many years now. We are quite alone\nin the world, we two--much to our mutual satisfaction. You must come\nup and see me some time; come up and have a look over the books we were\nspeaking of.”\n\n“I am much obliged,” said Theron, without enthusiasm. The thought of the\ndoctor by himself did not attract him greatly.\n\nThe reservation in his tone seemed to interest the doctor. “I suppose\nyou are the first man I have asked in a dozen years,” he remarked,\nfrankly willing that the young minister should appreciate the favor\nextended him. “It must be fully that since anybody but Vincent Forbes\nhas been under my roof; that is, of my own species, I mean.”\n\n“You live there quite alone,” commented Theron.\n\n“Quite--with my dogs and cats and lizards--and my Chinaman. I mustn't\nforget him.” The doctor noted the inquiry in the other's lifted brows,\nand smilingly explained. “He is my solitary servant. Possibly he\nmight not appeal to you much; but I can assure you he used to interest\nOctavius a great deal when I first brought him here, ten years ago or\nso. He afforded occupation for all the idle boys in the village for a\ntwelve-month at least. They used to lie in wait for him all day long,\nwith stones or horse-chestnuts or snowballs, according to the season.\nThe Irishmen from the wagon-works nearly killed him once or twice, but\nhe patiently lived it all down. The Chinaman has the patience to live\neverything down--the Caucasian races included. He will see us all to\nbed, will that gentleman with the pigtail!”\n\nThe music over in the church had lifted itself again into form and\nsequence, and defied the closed window. If anything, it was louder than\nbefore, and the sonorous roar of the bass-pedals seemed to be shaking\nthe very walls. It was something with a big-lunged, exultant, triumphing\nswing in it--something which ought to have been sung on the battlefield\nat the close of day by the whole jubilant army of victors. It was\nimpossible to pretend not to be listening to it; but the doctor\nsubmitted with an obvious scowl, and bit off the tip of his third cigar\nwith an annoyed air.\n\n“You don't seem to care much for music,” suggested Mr. Ware, when a lull\ncame.\n\nDr. Ledsmar looked up, lighted match in hand. “Say musicians!” he\ngrowled. “Has it ever occurred to you,” he went on, between puffs at the\nflame, “that the only animals who make the noises we call music are of\nthe bird family--a debased offshoot of the reptilian creation--the\nvery lowest types of the vertebrata now in existence? I insist upon\nthe parallel among humans. I have in my time, sir, had considerable\nopportunities for studying close at hand the various orders of mammalia\nwho devote themselves to what they describe as the arts. It may sound\na harsh judgement, but I am convinced that musicians stand on the very\nbottom rung of the ladder in the sub-cellar of human intelligence, even\nlower than painters and actors.”\n\nThis seemed such unqualified nonsense to the Rev. Mr. Ware that he\noffered no comment whatever upon it. He tried instead to divert his\nthoughts to the stormy strains which rolled in through the vibrating\nbrickwork, and to picture to himself the large, capable figure of Miss\nMadden seated in the half-light at the organ-board, swaying to and fro\nin a splendid ecstasy of power as she evoked at will this superb and\nordered uproar. But the doctor broke insistently in upon his musings.\n\n“All art, so-called, is decay,” he said, raising his voice. “When a race\nbegins to brood on the beautiful--so-called--it is a sign of rot, of\ngetting ready to fall from the tree. Take the Jews--those marvellous old\nfellows--who were never more than a handful, yet have imposed the rule\nof their ideas and their gods upon us for fifteen hundred years. Why?\nThey were forbidden by their most fundamental law to make sculptures or\npictures. That was at a time when the Egyptians, when the Assyrians, and\nother Semites, were running to artistic riot. Every great museum in\nthe world now has whole floors devoted to statues from the Nile, and\nmarvellous carvings from the palaces of Sargon and Assurbanipal. You\ncan get the artistic remains of the Jews during that whole period into\na child's wheelbarrow. They had the sense and strength to penalize art;\nthey alone survived. They saw the Egyptians go, the Assyrians go, the\nGreeks go, the late Romans go, the Moors in Spain go--all the artistic\npeoples perish. They remained triumphing over all. Now at last their\nlong-belated apogee is here; their decline is at hand. I am told that in\nthis present generation in Europe the Jews are producing a great lot of\nyoung painters and sculptors and actors, just as for a century they have\nbeen producing famous composers and musicians. That means the end of the\nJews!”\n\n“What! have you only got as far as that?” came the welcome interruption\nof a cheery voice. Father Forbes had entered the room, and stood looking\ndown with a whimsical twinkle in his eye from one to the other of his\nguests.\n\n“You must have been taken over the ground at a very slow pace, Mr.\nWare,” he continued, chuckling softly, “to have arrived merely at the\ncollapse of the New Jerusalem. I fancied I had given him time enough to\nbring you straight up to the end of all of us, with that Chinaman of\nhis gently slapping our graves with his pigtail. That's where the doctor\nalways winds up, if he's allowed to run his course.”\n\n“It has all been very interesting, extremely so, I assure you,” faltered\nTheron. It had become suddenly apparent to him that he desired nothing\nso much as to make his escape--that he had indeed only been waiting for\nthe host's return to do so.\n\nHe rose at this, and explained that he must be going. No special effort\nbeing put forth to restrain him, he presently made his way out, Father\nForbes hospitably following him down to the door, and putting a very\ngracious cordiality into his adieux.\n\nThe night was warm and black. Theron stood still in it the moment the\npastorate door had closed; the sudden darkness was so thick that it\nwas as if he had closed his eyes. His dominant sensation was of a deep\nrelief and rest after some undue fatigue. It crossed his mind that\ndrunken men probably felt like that as they leaned against things on\ntheir way home. He was affected himself, he saw, by the weariness and\nhalf-nausea following a mental intoxication. The conceit pleased him,\nand he smiled to himself as he turned and took the first homeward steps.\nIt must be growing late, he thought. Alice would be wondering as she\nwaited.\n\nThere was a street lamp at the corner, and as he walked toward it he\nnoted all at once that his feet were keeping step to the movement of\nthe music proceeding from the organ within the church--a vaguely\nprocessional air, marked enough in measure, but still with a dreamy\neffect. It became a pleasure to identify his progress with the quaint\nrhythm of sound as he sauntered along. He discovered, as he neared\nthe light, that he was instinctively stepping over the seams in the\nflagstone sidewalk as he had done as a boy. He smiled again at this.\nThere was something exceptionally juvenile and buoyant about his mood,\nnow that he examined it. He set it down as a reaction from that doctor's\nextravagant and incendiary talk. One thing was certain--he would never\nbe caught up at that house beyond the race-course, with its reptiles and\nits Chinaman. Should he ever even go to the pastorate again? He decided\nnot to quite definitely answer THAT in the negative, but as he felt now,\nthe chances were all against it.\n\nTurning the corner, and walking off into the shadows along the side\nof the huge church building, Theron noted, almost at the end of the\nedifice, a small door--the entrance to a porch coming out to the\nsidewalk--which stood wide open. A thin, pale, vertical line of light\nshowed that the inner door, too, was ajar.\n\nThrough this wee aperture the organ-music, reduced and mellowed by\ndistance, came to him again with that same curious, intimate, personal\nrelation which had so moved him at the start, before the doctor closed\nthe window. It was as if it was being played for him alone.\n\nHe paused for a doubting minute or two, with bowed head, listening to\nthe exquisite harmony which floated out to caress and soothe and enfold\nhim. There was no spiritual, or at least pious, effect in it now.\nHe fancied that it must be secular music, or, if not, then something\nadapted to marriage ceremonies--rich, vivid, passionate, a celebration\nof beauty and the glory of possession, with its ruling note of joy only\nheightened by soft, wooing interludes, and here and there the tremor of\na fond, timid little sob.\n\nTheron turned away irresolutely, half frightened at the undreamt-of\nimpression this music was making upon him. Then, all at once, he wheeled\nand stepped boldly into the porch, pushing the inner door open and\nhearing it rustle against its leathern frame as it swung to behind him.\n\nHe had never been inside a Catholic church before.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nJeremiah Madden was supposed to be probably the richest man in Octavius.\nThere was no doubt at all about his being its least pretentious citizen.\n\nThe huge and ornate modern mansion which he had built, putting to shame\nevery other house in the place, gave an effect of ostentation to the\nMaddens as a family; it seemed only to accentuate the air of humility\nwhich enveloped Jeremiah as with a garment. Everybody knew some version\nof the many tales afloat which, in a kindly spirit, illustrated the\nincongruity between him and his splendid habitation. Some had it that he\nslept in the shed. Others told whimsical stories of his sitting alone in\nthe kitchen evenings, smoking his old clay pipe, and sorrowing because\nthe second Mrs. Madden would not suffer the pigs and chickens to come\nin and bear him company. But no matter how comic the exaggeration,\nthese legends were invariably amiable. It lay in no man's mouth to speak\nharshly of Jeremiah Madden.\n\nHe had been born a Connemara peasant, and he would die one. When he\nwas ten years old he had seen some of his own family, and most of his\nneighbors, starve to death. He could remember looking at the stiffened\nfigure of a woman stretched on the stones by the roadside, with the\ngreen stain of nettles on her white lips. A girl five years or so\nolder than himself, also a Madden and distantly related, had started\nin despair off across the mountains to the town where it was said the\npoor-law officers were dealing out food. He could recall her coming back\nnext day, wild-eyed with hunger and the fever; the officers had refused\nher relief because her bare legs were not wholly shrunken to the bone.\n“While there's a calf on the shank, there's no starvation,” they had\nexplained to her. The girl died without profiting by this official\napothegm. The boy found it burned ineffaceably upon his brain. Now,\nafter a lapse of more than forty years, it seemed the thing that he\nremembered best about Ireland.\n\nHe had drifted westward as an unconsidered, unresisting item in that\nvast flight of the famine years. Others whom he rubbed against in that\nmelancholy exodus, and deemed of much greater promise than himself, had\ndone badly. Somehow he did well. He learned the wheelwright's trade,\nand really that seemed all there was to tell. The rest had been calm\nand sequent progression--steady employment as a journeyman first; then\nmarriage and a house and lot; the modest start as a master; the move to\nOctavius and cheap lumber; the growth of his business, always marked of\nlate years stupendous--all following naturally, easily, one thing out of\nanother. Jeremiah encountered the idea among his fellows, now and again,\nthat he was entitled to feel proud of all this. He smiled to himself at\nthe thought, and then sent a sigh after the smile. What was it all but\nempty and transient vanity? The score of other Connemara boys he had\nknown--none very fortunate, several broken tragically in prison or the\ngutter, nearly all now gone the way of flesh--were as good as he. He\ncould not have it in his heart to take credit for his success; it would\nhave been like sneering over their poor graves.\n\nJeremiah Madden was now fifty-three--a little man of a reddened,\nweather-worn skin and a meditative, almost saddened, aspect. He had blue\neyes, but his scanty iron-gray hair showed raven black in its shadows.\nThe width and prominence of his cheek-bones dominated all one's\nrecollections of his face. The long vertical upper-lip and irregular\nteeth made, in repose, an unshapely mouth; its smile, though, sweetened\nthe whole countenance. He wore a fringe of stiff, steel-colored beard,\npassing from ear to ear under his chin. His week-day clothes were as\nsimple as his workaday manners, fitting his short black pipe and his\nsteadfast devotion to his business. On Sundays he dressed with a certain\nrigor of respectability, all in black, and laid aside tobacco, at least\nto the public view. He never missed going to the early Low Mass, quite\nalone. His family always came later, at the ten o'clock High Mass.\n\nThere had been, at one time or another, a good many members of this\nfamily. Two wives had borne Jeremiah Madden a total of over a dozen\nchildren. Of these there survived now only two of the first Mrs.\nMadden's offspring--Michael and Celia--and a son of the present wife,\nwho had been baptized Terence, but called himself Theodore. This\nminority of the family inhabited the great new house on Main Street.\nJeremiah went every Sunday afternoon by himself to kneel in the presence\nof the majority, there where they lay in Saint Agnes' consecrated\nground. If the weather was good, he generally extended his walk through\nthe fields to an old deserted Catholic burial-field, which had been used\nonly in the first years after the famine invasion, and now was clean\nforgotten. The old wagon-maker liked to look over the primitive,\nneglected stones which marked the graves of these earlier exiles. Fully\nhalf of the inscriptions mentioned his County Galway--there were two\nnaming the very parish adjoining his. The latest date on any stone was\nof the remoter 'fifties. They had all been stricken down, here in this\nstrange land with its bitter winters, while the memory of their own\nsoft, humid, gentle west-coast air was fresh within them. Musing upon\nthe clumsy sculpture, with its “R.I.P.,” or “Pray for the Soul of,” half\nto be guessed under the stain and moss of a generation, there would seem\nto him but a step from this present to that heart-rending, awful past.\nWhat had happened between was a meaningless vision--as impersonal as the\npassing of the planets overhead. He rarely had an impulse to tears\nin the new cemetery, where his ten children were. He never left this\nweed-grown, forsaken old God's-acre dry-eyed.\n\nOne must not construct from all this the image of a melancholy man, as\nhis fellows met and knew him. Mr. Madden kept his griefs, racial and\nindividual, for his own use. To the men about him in the offices and\nthe shops he presented day after day, year after year, an imperturbable\ncheeriness of demeanor. He had been always fortunate in the selection of\nlieutenants and chief helpers. Two of these had grown now into partners,\nand were almost as much a part of the big enterprise as Jeremiah\nhimself. They spoke often of their inability to remember any unjust or\npetulant word of his--much less any unworthy deed. Once they had seen\nhim in a great rage, all the more impressive because he said next to\nnothing. A thoughtless fellow told a dirty story in the presence of\nsome apprentices; and Madden, listening to this, drove the offender\nimplacably from his employ. It was years now since any one who knew him\nhad ventured upon lewd pleasantries in his hearing. Jokes of the sort\nwhich women might hear he was very fond of though he had not much humor\nof his own. Of books he knew nothing whatever, and he made only the most\nperfunctory pretence now and again of reading the newspapers.\n\nThe elder son Michael was very like his father--diligent, unassuming,\nkindly, and simple--a plain, tall, thin red man of nearly thirty, who\ntoiled in paper cap and rolled-up shirt-sleeves as the superintendent in\nthe saw-mill, and put on no airs whatever as the son of the master.\nIf there was surprise felt at his not being taken into the firm as a\npartner, he gave no hint of sharing it. He attended to his religious\nduties with great zeal, and was President of the Sodality as a matter\nof course. This was regarded as his blind side; and young employees\nwho cultivated it, and made broad their phylacteries under his notice,\ncertainly had an added chance of getting on well in the works. To some\nfew whom he knew specially well, Michael would confess that if he\nhad had the brains for it, he should have wished to be a priest. He\ndisplayed no inclination to marry.\n\nThe other son, Terence, was some eight years younger, and seemed the\nproduct of a wholly different race. The contrast between Michael's sandy\nskin and long gaunt visage and this dark boy's handsome, rounded face,\nwith its prettily curling black hair, large, heavily fringed brown\neyes, and delicately modelled features, was not more obvious than their\ntemperamental separation. This second lad had been away for years at\nschool,--indeed, at a good many schools, for no one seemed to manage\nto keep him long. He had been with the Jesuits at Georgetown, with the\nChristian Brothers at Manhattan; the sectarian Mt. St. Mary's and the\nseverely secular Annapolis had both been tried, and proved misfits.\nThe young man was home again now, and save that his name had become\nTheodore, he appeared in no wise changed from the beautiful, wilful,\nbold, and showy boy who had gone away in his teens. He was still rather\nsmall for his years, but so gracefully moulded in form, and so perfectly\ntailored, that the fact seemed rather an advantage than otherwise.\nHe never dreamed of going near the wagon-works, but he did go a good\ndeal--in fact, most of the time--to the Nedahma Club. His mother spoke\noften to her friends about her fears for his health. He never spoke to\nhis friends about his mother at all.\n\nThe second Mrs. Madden did not, indeed, appeal strongly to the family\npride. She had been a Miss Foley, a dress-maker, and an old maid.\nJeremiah had married her after a brief widowerhood, principally\nbecause she was the sister of his parish priest, and had a considerable\nreputation for piety. It was at a time when the expansion of his\nbusiness was promising certain wealth, and suggesting the removal to\nOctavius. He was conscious of a notion that his obligations to social\nrespectability were increasing; it was certain that the embarrassments\nof a motherless family were. Miss Foley had shown a good deal of\nattention to his little children. She was not ill-looking; she bore\nherself with modesty; she was the priest's sister--the niece once\nremoved of a vicar-general. And so it came about.\n\nAlthough those most concerned did not say so, everybody could see from\nthe outset the pity of its ever having come about at all. The pious\nand stiffly respectable priest's sister had been harmless enough as\na spinster. It made the heart ache to contemplate her as a wife.\nIncredibly narrow-minded, ignorant, suspicious, vain, and sour-tempered,\nshe must have driven a less equable and well-rooted man than Jeremiah\nMadden to drink or flight. He may have had his temptations, but they\nmade no mark on the even record of his life. He only worked the harder,\nconcentrating upon his business those extra hours which another sort of\nhome-life would have claimed instead. The end of twenty years found him\na rich man, but still toiling pertinaciously day by day, as if he had\nhis wage to earn. In the great house which had been built to please, or\nrather placate, his wife, he kept to himself as much as possible. The\npopular story of his smoking alone in the kitchen was more or less\ntrue; only Michael as a rule sat with him, too weak-lunged for tobacco\nhimself, but reading stray scraps from the papers to the lonely old man,\nand talking with him about the works, the while Jeremiah meditatively\nsucked his clay pipe. One or two evenings in the week the twain spent up\nin Celia's part of the house, listening with the awe of simple, honest\nmechanics to the music she played for them.\n\nCelia was to them something indefinably less, indescribably more, than\na daughter and sister. They could not think there had ever been anything\nlike her before in the world; the notion of criticising any deed or word\nof hers would have appeared to them monstrous and unnatural.\n\nShe seemed to have come up to this radiant and wise and marvellously\ntalented womanhood of hers, to their minds, quite spontaneously. There\nhad been a little Celia--a red-headed, sulky, mutinous slip of a girl,\nalways at war with her step-mother, and affording no special comfort or\nhope to the rest of the family. Then there was a long gap, during which\nthe father, four times a year, handed Michael a letter he had received\nfrom the superioress of a distant convent, referring with cold formality\nto the studies and discipline by which Miss Madden might profit more if\nshe had been better brought up, and enclosing a large bill. Then all at\nonce they beheld a big Celia, whom they spoke of as being home again,\nbut who really seemed never to have been there before--a tall, handsome,\nconfident young woman, swift of tongue and apprehension, appearing to\nknow everything there was to be known by the most learned, able to paint\npictures, carve wood, speak in divers languages, and make music for the\ngods, yet with it all a very proud lady, one might say a queen.\n\nThe miracle of such a Celia as this impressed itself even upon the\nstep-mother. Mrs. Madden had looked forward with a certain grim\ntightening of her combative jaws to the home-coming of the “red-head.”\n She felt herself much more the fine lady now than she had been when the\ngirl went away. She had her carriage now, and the magnificent new house\nwas nearly finished, and she had a greater number of ailments, and\nspent far more money on doctor's bills, than any other lady in the\nwhole section. The flush of pride in her greatest achievement up to\ndate--having the most celebrated of New York physicians brought up to\nOctavius by special train--still prickled in her blood. It was in\nall the papers, and the admiration of the flatterers and\n“soft-sawdherers”--wives of Irish merchants and smaller professional men\nwho formed her social circle--was raising visions in her poor head of\ngoing next year with Theodore to Saratoga, and fastening the attention\nof the whole fashionable republic upon the variety and resources of her\ninvalidism. Mrs. Madden's fancy did not run to the length of seeing her\nstep-daughter also at Saratoga; it pictured her still as the sullen\nand hated “red-head,” moping defiantly in corners, or courting by\nher insolence the punishments which leaped against their leash in the\nstep-mother's mind to get at her.\n\nThe real Celia, when she came, fairly took Mrs. Madden's breath away.\nThe peevish little plans for annoyance and tyranny, the resolutions born\nof ignorant and jealous egotism, found themselves swept out of sight by\nthe very first swirl of Celia's dress-train, when she came down from her\nroom robed in peacock blue. The step-mother could only stare.\n\nNow, after two years of it, Mrs. Madden still viewed her step-daughter\nwith round-eyed uncertainty, not unmixed with wrathful fear. She still\ndrove about behind two magnificent horses; the new house had become\nalmost tiresome by familiarity; her pre-eminence in the interested minds\nof the Dearborn County Medical Society was as towering as ever, but\nsomehow it was all different. There was a note of unreality nowadays\nin Mrs. Donnelly's professions of wonder at her bearing up under\nher multiplied maladies; there was almost a leer of mockery in the\nsympathetic smirk with which the Misses Mangan listened to her symptoms.\nEven the doctors, though they kept their faces turned toward her,\nobviously did not pay much attention; the people in the street seemed no\nlonger to look at her and her equipage at all. Worst of all, something\nof the meaning of this managed to penetrate her own mind. She caught now\nand again a dim glimpse of herself as others must have been seeing her\nfor years--as a stupid, ugly, boastful, and bad-tempered old nuisance.\nAnd it was always as if she saw this in a mirror held up by Celia.\n\nOf open discord there had been next to none. Celia would not permit it,\nand showed this so clearly from the start that there was scarcely need\nfor her saying it. It seemed hardly necessary for her to put into words\nany of her desires, for that matter. All existing arrangements in the\nMadden household seemed to shrink automatically and make room for her,\nwhichever way she walked. A whole quarter of the unfinished house set\nitself apart for her. Partitions altered themselves; door-ways moved\nacross to opposite sides; a recess opened itself, tall and deep, for it\nknew not what statue--simply because, it seemed, the Lady Celia willed\nit so.\n\nWhen the family moved into this mansion, it was with a consciousness\nthat the only one who really belonged there was Celia. She alone could\nbehave like one perfectly at home. It seemed entirely natural to the\nothers that she should do just what she liked, shut them off from her\nportion of the house, take her meals there if she felt disposed, and\nkeep such hours as pleased her instant whim. If she awakened them at\nmidnight by her piano, or deferred her breakfast to the late afternoon,\nthey felt that it must be all right, since Celia did it. She had one\nroom furnished with only divans and huge, soft cushions, its walls\ncovered with large copies of statuary not too strictly clothed, which\nshe would suffer no one, not even the servants, to enter. Michael\nfancied sometimes, when he passed the draped entrance to this sacred\nchamber, that the portiere smelt of tobacco, but he would not have\nspoken of it, even had he been sure. Old Jeremiah, whose established\nhabit it was to audit minutely the expenses of his household, covered\nover round sums to Celia's separate banking account, upon the mere\nplayful hint of her holding her check-book up, without a dream of\nquestioning her.\n\nThat the step-mother had joy, or indeed anything but gall and wormwood,\nout of all this is not to be pretended. There lingered along in the\nrecollection of the family some vague memories of her having tried to\nassert an authority over Celia's comings and goings at the outset, but\nthey grouped themselves as only parts of the general disorder of moving\nand settling, which a fort-night or so quite righted. Mrs. Madden\nstill permitted herself a certain license of hostile comment when her\nstep-daughter was not present, and listened with gratification to what\nthe women of her acquaintance ventured upon saying in the same spirit;\nbut actual interference or remonstrance she never offered nowadays.\nThe two rarely met, for that matter, and exchanged only the baldest and\ncurtest forms of speech.\n\nCelia Madden interested all Octavius deeply. This she must have done\nin any case, if only because she was the only daughter of its richest\ncitizen. But the bold, luxuriant quality of her beauty, the original\nand piquant freedom of her manners, the stories told in gossip about\nher lawlessness at home, her intellectual attainments, and artistic\nvagaries--these were even more exciting. The unlikelihood of her\nmarrying any one--at least any Octavian--was felt to add a certain\nromantic zest to the image she made on the local perceptions. There was\nno visible young Irishman at all approaching the social and financial\nstandard of the Maddens; it was taken for granted that a mixed marriage\nwas quite out of the question in this case. She seemed to have more\nbusiness about the church than even the priest. She was always playing\nthe organ, or drilling the choir, or decorating the altars with flowers,\nor looking over the robes of the acolytes for rents and stains, or going\nin or out of the pastorate. Clearly this was not the sort of girl to\ntake a Protestant husband.\n\nThe gossip of the town concerning her was, however, exclusively\nProtestant. The Irish spoke of her, even among themselves, but seldom.\nThere was no occasion for them to pretend to like her: they did not know\nher, except in the most distant and formal fashion. Even the members of\nthe choir, of both sexes, had the sense of being held away from her\nat haughty arm's length. No single parishioner dreamed of calling her\nfriend. But when they referred to her, it was always with a cautious and\nrespectful reticence. For one thing, she was the daughter of their chief\nman, the man they most esteemed and loved. For another, reservations\nthey may have had in their souls about her touched close upon a\ndelicately sore spot. It could not escape their notice that their\nProtestant neighbors were watching her with vigilant curiosity, and with\na certain tendency to wink when her name came into conversation along\nwith that of Father Forbes. It had never yet got beyond a tendency--the\nbarest fluttering suggestion of a tempted eyelid--but the whole Irish\npopulation of the place felt themselves to be waiting, with clenched\nfists but sinking hearts, for the wink itself.\n\nThe Rev. Theron Ware had not caught even the faintest hint of these\novertures to suspicion.\n\nWhen he had entered the huge, dark, cool vault of the church, he could\nsee nothing at first but a faint light up over the gallery, far at the\nother end. Then, little by little, his surroundings shaped themselves\nout of the gloom. To his right was a rail and some broad steps rising\ntoward a softly confused mass of little gray vertical bars and the pale\ntwinkle of tiny spots of gilded reflection, which he made out in the\ndusk to be the candles and trappings of the altar. Overhead the great\narches faded away from foundations of dimly discernible capitals\ninto utter blackness. There was a strange medicinal odor--as of cubeb\ncigarettes--in the air.\n\nAfter a little pause, he tiptoed noiselessly up the side aisle toward\nthe end of the church--toward the light above the gallery. This radiance\nfrom a single gas-jet expanded as he advanced, and spread itself upward\nover a burnished row of monster metal pipes, which went towering into\nthe darkness like giants. They were roaring at him now--a sonorous,\ndeafening, angry bellow, which made everything about him vibrate. The\ngallery balustrade hid the keyboard and the organist from view. There\nwere only these jostling brazen tubes, as big round as trees and as\ntall, trembling with their own furious thunder. It was for all the world\nas if he had wandered into some vast tragical, enchanted cave, and was\nbeing drawn against his will--like fascinated bird and python--toward\nfate at the savage hands of these swollen and enraged genii.\n\nHe stumbled in the obscure light over a kneeling-bench, making a\nconsiderable racket. On the instant the noise from the organ ceased, and\nhe saw the black figure of a woman rise above the gallery-rail and look\ndown.\n\n“Who is it?” the indubitable voice of Miss Madden demanded sharply.\n\nTheron had a sudden sheepish notion of turning and running. With the\nbest grace he could summon, he called out an explanation instead.\n\n“Wait a minute. I'm through now. I'm coming down,” she returned. He\nthought there was a note of amusement in her tone.\n\nShe came to him a moment later, accompanied by a thin, tall man, whom\nTheron could barely see in the dark, now that the organ-light too was\ngone. This man lighted a match or two to enable them to make their way\nout.\n\nWhen they were on the sidewalk, Celia spoke: “Walk on ahead, Michael!”\n she said. “I have some matters to speak of with Mr. Ware.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\n“Well, what did you think of Dr. Ledsmar?”\n\nThe girl's abrupt question came as a relief to Theron. They were walking\nalong in a darkness so nearly complete that he could see next to nothing\nof his companion. For some reason, this seemed to suggest a sort of\nimpropriety. He had listened to the footsteps of the man ahead--whom\nhe guessed to be a servant--and pictured him as intent upon getting up\nearly next morning to tell everybody that the Methodist minister had\nstolen into the Catholic church at night to walk home with Miss Madden.\nThat was going to be very awkward--yes, worse than awkward! It might\nmean ruin itself. She had mentioned aloud that she had matters to talk\nover with him: that of course implied confidences, and the man might\nput heaven only knew what construction on that. It was notorious that\nservants did ascribe the very worst motives to those they worked for.\nThe bare thought of the delight an Irish servant would have in also\ndragging a Protestant clergyman into the thing was sickening. And what\ncould she want to talk to him about, anyway? The minute of silence\nstretched itself out upon his nerves into an interminable period of\nanxious unhappiness. Her mention of the doctor at last somehow, seemed\nto lighten the situation.\n\n“Oh, I thought he was very smart.” he made haste to answer. “Wouldn't\nit be better--to--keep close to your man? He--may--think we've gone some\nother way.”\n\n“It wouldn't matter if he did,” remarked Celia. She appeared to\ncomprehend his nervousness and take pity on it, for she added, “It is\nmy brother Michael, as good a soul as ever lived. He is quite used to my\nways.”\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Ware drew a long comforting breath. “Oh, I see! He went\nwith you to--bring you home.”\n\n“To blow the organ,” said the girl in the dark, correctingly. “But about\nthat doctor; did you like him?”\n\n“Well,” Theron began, “'like' is rather a strong word for so short\nan acquaintance. He talked very well; that is, fluently. But he is so\ndifferent from any other man I have come into contact with that--”\n\n“What I wanted you to say was that you hated him,” put in Celia, firmly.\n\n“I don't make a practice of saying that of anybody,” returned Theron, so\nmuch at his ease again that he put an effect of gentle, smiling reproof\ninto the words. “And why specially should I make an exception for him?”\n\n“Because he's a beast!”\n\nTheron fancied that he understood. “I noticed that he seemed not to have\nmuch of an ear for music,” he commented, with a little laugh. “He shut\ndown the window when you began to play. His doing so annoyed me, because\nI--I wanted very much to hear it all. I never heard such music before.\nI--I came into the church to hear more of it; but then you stopped!”\n\n“I will play for you some other time,” Celia said, answering the\nreproach in his tone. “But tonight I wanted to talk with you instead.”\n\nShe kept silent, in spite of this, so long now that Theron was on the\npoint of jestingly asking when the talk was to begin. Then she put a\nquestion abruptly--\n\n“It is a conventional way of putting it, but are you fond of poetry, Mr.\nWare?”\n\n“Well, yes, I suppose I am,” replied Theron, much mystified. “I can't\nsay that I am any great judge; but I like the things that I like--and--”\n\n“Meredith,” interposed Celia, “makes one of his women, Emilia in\nEngland, say that poetry is like talking on tiptoe; like animals in\ncages, always going to one end and back again. Does it impress you that\nway?”\n\n“I don't know that it does,” said he, dubiously. It seemed, however,\nto be her whim to talk literature, and he went on: “I've hardly read\nMeredith at all. I once borrowed his 'Lucile,' but somehow I never got\ninterested in it. I heard a recitation of his once, though--a piece\nabout a dead wife, and the husband and another man quarrelling as to\nwhose portrait was in the locket on her neck, and of their going up to\nsettle the dispute, and finding that it was the likeness of a third man,\na young priest--and though it was very striking, it didn't give me a\nthirst to know his other poems. I fancied I shouldn't like them. But\nI daresay I was wrong. As I get older, I find that I take less narrow\nviews of literature--that is, of course, of light literature--and\nthat--that--”\n\nCelia mercifully stopped him. “The reason I asked you was--” she began,\nand then herself paused. “Or no,--never mind that--tell me something\nelse. Are you fond of pictures, statuary, the beautiful things of the\nworld? Do great works of art, the big achievements of the big artists,\nappeal to you, stir you up?”\n\n“Alas! that is something I can only guess at myself,” answered Theron,\nhumbly. “I have always lived in little places. I suppose, from your\npoint of view, I have never seen a good painting in my life. I can only\nsay this, though--that it has always weighed on my mind as a great and\nsore deprivation, this being shut out from knowing what others mean when\nthey talk and write about art. Perhaps that may help you to get at what\nyou are after. If I ever went to New York, I feel that one of the first\nthings I should do would be to see all the picture galleries; is that\nwhat you meant? And--would you mind telling me--why you--?”\n\n“Why I asked you?” Celia supplied his halting question. “No, I DON'T\nmind. I have a reason for wanting to know--to satisfy myself whether I\nhad guessed rightly or not--about the kind of man you are. I mean in the\nmatter of temperament and bent of mind and tastes.”\n\nThe girl seemed to be speaking seriously, and without intent to offend.\nTheron did not find any comment ready, but walked along by her side,\nwondering much what it was all about.\n\n“I daresay you think me 'too familiar on short acquaintance,'” she\ncontinued, after a little.\n\n“My dear Miss Madden!” he protested perfunctorily.\n\n“No; it is a matter of a good deal of importance,” she went on. “I can\nsee that you are going to be thrown into friendship, close contact, with\nFather Forbes. He likes you, and you can't help liking him. There is\nnobody else in this raw, overgrown, empty-headed place for you and him\nTO like, nobody except that man, that Dr. Ledsmar. And if you like HIM,\nI shall hate you! He has done mischief enough already. I am counting on\nyou to help undo it, and to choke him off from doing more. It would be\ndifferent if you were an ordinary Orthodox minister, all encased like\na terrapin in prejudices and nonsense. Of course, if you had been THAT\nkind, we should never have got to know you at all. But when I saw you in\nMacEvoy's cottage there, it was plain that you were one of US--I mean a\nMAN, and not a marionette or a mummy. I am talking very frankly to you,\nyou see. I want you on my side, against that doctor and his heartless,\nbloodless science.”\n\n“I feel myself very heartily on your side,” replied Theron. She had set\ntheir progress at a slower pace, now that the lights of the main\nstreet were drawing near, as if to prolong their talk. All his earlier\nreservations had fled. It was almost as if she were a parishioner of\nhis own. “I need hardly tell you that the doctor's whole attitude\ntoward--toward revelation--was deeply repugnant to me. It doesn't make\nit any the less hateful to call it science. I am afraid, though,” he\nwent on hesitatingly, “that there are difficulties in the way of my\nhelping, as you call it. You see, the very fact of my being a Methodist\nminister, and his being a Catholic priest, rather puts my interference\nout of the question.”\n\n“No; that doesn't matter a button,” said Celia, lightly. “None of us\nthink of that at all.”\n\n“There is the other embarrassment, then,” pursued Theron, diffidently,\n“that Father Forbes is a vastly broader and deeper scholar--in all these\nmatters--than I am. How could I possibly hope to influence him by my\npoor arguments? I don't know even the alphabet of the language he thinks\nin--on these subjects, I mean.”\n\n“Of course you don't!” interposed the girl, with a confidence which the\nother, for all his meekness, rather winced under. “That wasn't what\nI meant at all. We don't want arguments from our friends: we want\nsympathies, sensibilities, emotional bonds. The right person's silence\nis worth more for companionship than the wisest talk in the world from\nanybody else. It isn't your mind that is needed here, or what you know;\nit is your heart, and what you feel. You are full of poetry, of ideals,\nof generous, unselfish impulses. You see the human, the warm-blooded\nside of things. THAT is what is really valuable. THAT is how you can\nhelp!”\n\n“You overestimate me sadly,” protested Theron, though with considerable\ntolerance for her error in his tone. “But you ought to tell me something\nabout this Dr. Ledsmar. He spoke of being an old friend of the pr--of\nFather Forbes.”\n\n“Oh, yes, they've always known each other; that is, for many years. They\nwere professors together in a college once, heaven only knows how long\nago. Then they separated, I fancy they quarrelled, too, before they\nparted. The doctor came here, where some relative had left him the\nplace he lives in. Then in time the Bishop chanced to send Father Forbes\nhere--that was about three years ago,--and the two men after a while\nrenewed their old relations. They dine together; that is the doctor's\nstronghold. He knows more about eating than any other man alive, I\nbelieve. He studies it as you would study a language. He has taught\nold Maggie, at the pastorate there, to cook like the mother of all\nthe Delmonicos. And while they sit and stuff themselves, or loll about\nafterward like gorged snakes, they think it is smart to laugh at all the\nsweet and beautiful things in life, and to sneer at people who believe\nin ideals, and to talk about mankind being merely a fortuitous product\nof fermentation, and twaddle of that sort. It makes me sick!”\n\n“I can readily see,” said Theron, with sympathy, “how such a cold,\nmaterial, and infidel influence as that must shock and revolt an\nessentially religious temperament like yours.”\n\nMiss Madden looked up at him. They had turned into the main street, and\nthere was light enough for him to detect something startlingly like a\ngrin on her beautiful face.\n\n“But I'm not religious at all, you know,” he heard her say. “I'm as\nPagan as--anything! Of course there are forms to be observed, and so on;\nI rather like them than otherwise. I can make them serve very well for\nmy own system; for I am myself, you know, an out-an-out Greek.”\n\n“Why, I had supposed that you were full blooded Irish,” the Rev. Mr.\nWare found himself remarking, and then on the instant was overwhelmed by\nthe consciousness that he had said a foolish thing. Precisely where the\nfolly lay he did not know, but it was impossible to mistake the gesture\nof annoyance which his companion had instinctively made at his words.\nShe had widened the distance between them now, and quickened her step.\nThey went on in silence till they were within a block of her house.\nSeveral people had passed them who Theron felt sure must have recognized\nthem both.\n\n“What I meant was,” the girl all at once began, drawing nearer again,\nand speaking with patient slowness, “that I find myself much more in\nsympathy with the Greek thought, the Greek theology of the beautiful\nand the strong, the Greek philosophy of life, and all that, than what is\ntaught nowadays. Personally, I take much more stock in Plato than I\ndo in Peter. But of course it is a wholly personal affair; I had no\nbusiness to bother you with it. And for that matter, I oughtn't to have\ntroubled you with any of our--”\n\n“I assure you, Miss Madden!” the young minister began, with fervor.\n\n“No,” she broke in, in a resigned and even downcast tone; “let it all be\nas if I hadn't spoken. Don't mind anything I have said. If it is to be,\nit will be. You can't say more than that, can you?”\n\nShe looked into his face again, and her large eyes produced an\nimpression of deep melancholy, which Theron found himself somehow\nimpelled to share. Things seemed all at once to have become very sad\nindeed.\n\n“It is one of my unhappy nights,” she explained, in gloomy confidence.\n“I get them every once in a while--as if some vicious planet or other\nwas crossing in front of my good star--and then I'm a caution to snakes.\nI shut myself up--that's the only thing to do--and have it out with\nmyself I didn't know but the organ-music would calm me down, but it\nhasn't. I shan't sleep a wink tonight, but just rage around from one\nroom to another, piling all the cushions from the divans on to the\nfloor, and then kicking them away again. Do YOU ever have fits like\nthat?”\n\nTheron was able to reply with a good conscience in the negative. It\noccurred to him to add, with jocose intent: “I am curious to know,\ndo these fits, as you call them, occupy a prominent part in Grecian\nphilosophy as a general rule?”\n\nCelia gave a little snort, which might have signified amusement, but did\nnot speak until they were upon her own sidewalk. “There is my brother,\nwaiting at the gate,” she said then, briefly.\n\n“Well, then, I will bid you good-night here, I think,” Theron remarked,\ncoming to a halt, and offering his hand. “It must be getting very\nlate, and my--that is--I have to be up particularly early tomorrow. So\ngood-night; I hope you will be feeling ever so much better in spirits in\nthe morning.”\n\n“Oh, that doesn't matter,” replied the girl, listlessly. “It's a very\npaltry little affair, this life of ours, at the best of it. Luckily it's\nsoon done with--like a bad dream.”\n\n“Tut! Tut! I won't have you talk like that!” interrupted Theron, with a\nswift and smart assumption of authority. “Such talk isn't sensible, and\nit isn't good. I have no patience with it!”\n\n“Well, try and have a little patience with ME, anyway, just for\ntonight,” said Celia, taking the reproof with gentlest humility, rather\nto her censor's surprise. “I really am unhappy tonight, Mr. Ware, very\nunhappy. It seems as if all at once the world had swelled out in size\na thousandfold, and that poor me had dwindled down to the merest wee\nlittle red-headed atom--the most helpless and forlorn and lonesome of\natoms at that.” She seemed to force a sorrowful smile on her face as she\nadded: “But all the same it has done me good to be with you--I am sure\nit has--and I daresay that by tomorrow I shall be quite out of the\nblues. Good-night, Mr. Ware. Forgive my making such an exhibition of\nmyself I WAS going to be such a fine early Greek, you know, and I have\nturned out only a late Milesian--quite of the decadence. I shall do\nbetter next time. And good-night again, and ever so many thanks.”\n\nShe was walking briskly away toward the gate now, where the shadowy\nMichael still patiently stood. Theron strode off in the opposite\ndirection, taking long, deliberate steps, and bowing his head in\nthought. He had his hands behind his back, as was his wont, and the\nsense of their recent contact with her firm, ungloved hands was,\ncuriously enough, the thing which pushed itself uppermost in his mind.\nThere had been a frank, almost manly vigor in her grasp; he said\nto himself that of course that came from her playing so much on the\nkeyboard; the exercise naturally would give her large, robust hands.\n\nSuddenly he remembered about the piano; he had quite forgotten to\nsolicit her aid in selecting it. He turned, upon the impulse, to go\nback. She had not entered the gate as yet, but stood, shiningly visible\nunder the street lamp, on the sidewalk, and she was looking in his\ndirection. He turned again like a shot, and started homeward.\n\nThe front door of the parsonage was unlocked, and he made his way on\ntiptoe through the unlighted hall to the living-room. The stuffy air\nhere was almost suffocating with the evil smell of a kerosene\nlamp turned down too low. Alice sat asleep in her old farmhouse\nrocking-chair, with an inelegant darning-basket on the table by her\nside. The whole effect of the room was as bare and squalid to Theron's\nnewly informed eye as the atmosphere was offensive to his nostrils. He\ncoughed sharply, and his wife sat up and looked at the clock. It was\nafter eleven.\n\n“Where on earth have you been?” she asked, with a yawn, turning up the\nwick of her sewing-lamp again.\n\n“You ought never to turn down a light like that,” said Theron, with a\ncomplaining note in his voice. “It smells up the whole place. I never\ndreamed of your sitting up for me like this. You ought to have gone to\nbed.”\n\n“But how could I guess that you were going to be so late?,” she\nretorted. “And you haven't told me where you were. Is this book of yours\ngoing to keep you up like this right along?”\n\nThe episode of the book was buried in the young minister's mind beneath\nsuch a mass of subsequent experiences that it required an effort for him\nto grasp what she was talking about. It seemed as if months had elapsed\nsince he was in earnest about that book; and yet he had left the house\nfull of it only a few hours before. He shook his wits together, and made\nanswer--\n\n“Oh, bless you, no! Only there arose a very curious question. You have\nno idea, literally no conception, of the interesting and important\nproblems which are raised by the mere fact of Abraham leaving the city\nof Ur. It's amazing, I assure you. I hadn't realized it myself.”\n\n“Well,” remarked Alice, rising--and with good-humor and petulance\nstruggling sleepily ill her tone--“all I've got to say is, that if\nAbraham hasn't anything better to do than to keep young ministers of the\ngospel out, goodness knows where, till all hours of the night, I wish to\ngracious he'd stayed in the city of Ur right straight along.”\n\n“You have no idea what a scholarly man Dr. Ledsmar is,” Theron suddenly\nfound himself inspired to volunteer. “He has the most marvellous\ncollection of books--a whole library devoted to this very subject--and\nhe has put them all quite freely at my disposal. Extremely kind of him,\nisn't it?”\n\n“Ledsmar? Ledsmar?” queried Alice. “I don't seem to remember the name.\nHe isn't the little man with the birthmark, who sits in the pew behind\nthe Lovejoys, is he? I think some one said he was a doctor.”\n\n“Yes, a horse doctor!” said Theron, with a sniff. “No; you haven't seen\nthis Dr. Ledsmar at all. I--I don't know that he attends any church\nregularly. I scraped his acquaintance quite by accident. He is really a\ncharacter. He lives in the big house, just beyond the race-course, you\nknow--the one with the tower at the back--”\n\n“No, I don't know. How should I? I've hardly poked my nose outside of\nthe yard since I have been here.”\n\n“Well, you shall go,” said the husband, consolingly. “You HAVE been\ncooped up here too much, poor girl. I must take you out more, really.\nI don't know that I could take you to the doctor's place--without an\ninvitation, I mean. He is very queer about some things. He lives there\nall alone, for instance, with only a Chinaman for a servant. He told\nme I was almost the only man he had asked under his roof for years. He\nisn't a practising physician at all, you know. He is a scientist; he\nmakes experiments with lizards--and things.”\n\n“Theron,” the wife said, pausing lamp in hand on her way to the bedroom,\n“do you be careful, now! For all you know this doctor may be a loose\nman, or pretty near an infidel. You've got to be mighty particular in\nsuch matters, you know, or you'll have the trustees down on you like a\n'thousand of bricks.'”\n\n“I will thank the trustees to mind their own business,” said Theron,\nstiffly, and the subject dropped.\n\nThe bedroom window upstairs was open, and upon the fresh night air\nwas borne in the shrill, jangling sound of a piano, being played off\nsomewhere in the distance, but so vehemently that the noise imposed\nitself upon the silence far and wide. Theron listened to this as he\nundressed. It proceeded from the direction of the main street, and he\nknew, as by instinct, that it was the Madden girl who was playing. The\nincongruity of the hour escaped his notice. He mused instead upon the\nwild and tropical tangle of moods, emotions, passions, which had grown\nup in that strange temperament. He found something very pathetic in\nthat picture she had drawn of herself in forecast, roaming disconsolate\nthrough her rooms the livelong night, unable to sleep. The woful moan of\ninsomnia seemed to make itself heard in every strain from her piano.\n\nAlice heard it also, but being unillumined, she missed the romantic\npathos. “I call it disgraceful,” she muttered from her pillow, “for\nfolks to be banging away on a piano at this time of night. There ought\nto be a law to prevent it.”\n\n“It may be some distressed soul,” said Theron, gently, “seeking relief\nfrom the curse of sleeplessness.”\n\nThe wife laughed, almost contemptuously. “Distressed fiddlesticks!” was\nher only other comment.\n\nThe music went on for a long time--rising now to strident heights, now\nsinking off to the merest tinkling murmur, and broken ever and again by\nintervals of utter hush. It did not prevent Alice from at once falling\nsound asleep; but Theron lay awake, it seemed to him, for hours,\nlistening tranquilly, and letting his mind wander at will through the\npleasant antechambers of Sleep, where are more unreal fantasies than\nDreamland itself affords.\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nFor some weeks the Rev. Theron Ware saw nothing of either the priest or\nthe doctor, or the interesting Miss Madden.\n\nThere were, indeed, more urgent matters to think about. June had come;\nand every succeeding day brought closer to hand the ordeal of his first\nQuarterly Conference in Octavius. The waters grew distinctly rougher as\nhis pastoral bark neared this difficult passage.\n\nHe would have approached the great event with an easier mind if he could\nhave made out just how he stood with his congregation. Unfortunately\nnothing in his previous experiences helped him in the least to measure\nor guess at the feelings of these curious Octavians. Their Methodism\nseemed to be sound enough, and to stick quite to the letter of the\nDiscipline, so long as it was expressed in formulae. It was its spirit\nwhich he felt to be complicated by all sorts of conditions wholly novel\nto him.\n\nThe existence of a line of street-cars in the town, for example, would\nnot impress the casual thinker as likely to prove a rock in the path of\npeaceful religion. Theron, in his simplicity, had even thought, when he\nfirst saw these bobtailed cars bumping along the rails in the middle of\nthe main street, that they must be a great convenience to people living\nin the outskirts, who wished to get in to church of a Sunday morning. He\nwas imprudent enough to mention this in conversation with one of his new\nparishioners. Then he learned, to his considerable chagrin, that when\nthis line was built, some years before, a bitter war of words had been\nfought upon the question of its being worked on the Sabbath day. The\nthen occupant of the Methodist pulpit had so distinguished himself\nabove the rest by the solemnity and fervor of his protests against this\ninsolent desecration of God's day that the Methodists of Octavius\nstill felt themselves peculiarly bound to hold this horse-car line, its\nmanagement, and everything connected with it, in unbending aversion. At\nleast once a year they were accustomed to expect a sermon denouncing it\nand all its impious Sunday patrons. Theron made a mental resolve that\nthis year they should be disappointed.\n\nAnother burning problem, which he had not been called upon before to\nconfront, he found now entangled with the mysterious line which divided\na circus from a menagerie. Those itinerant tent-shows had never come his\nway heretofore, and he knew nothing of that fine balancing proportion\nbetween ladies in tights on horseback and cages full of deeply\neducational animals, which, even as the impartial rain, was designed\nto embrace alike the just and the unjust. There had arisen inside the\nMethodist society of Octavius some painful episodes, connected with\nmembers who took their children “just to see the animals,” and were\nconvicted of having also watched the Rose-Queen of the Arena, in her\nunequalled flying leap through eight hoops, with an ardent and unashamed\neye. One of these cases still remained on the censorial docket of the\nchurch; and Theron understood that he was expected to name a committee\nof five to examine and try it. This he neglected to do.\n\nHe was no longer at all certain that the congregation as a whole liked\nhis sermons. The truth was, no doubt, that he had learned enough to\ncease regarding the congregation as a whole. He could still rely upon\ncarrying along with him in his discourses from the pulpit a large\nmajority of interested and approving faces. But here, unhappily, was a\ncase where the majority did not rule. The minority, relatively small in\nnumbers, was prodigious in virile force.\n\nMore than twenty years had now elapsed since that minor schism in the\nMethodist Episcopal Church, the result of which was the independent body\nknown as Free Methodists, had relieved the parent flock of its principal\ndisturbing element. The rupture came fittingly at that time when all the\n“isms” of the argumentative fifties were hurled violently together into\nthe melting-pot of civil war. The great Methodist Church, South, had\nbroken bodily off on the question of State Rights. The smaller and\ndomestic fraction of Free Methodism separated itself upon an issue\nwhich may be most readily described as one of civilization. The seceders\nresented growth in material prosperity; they repudiated the introduction\nof written sermons and organ-music; they deplored the increasing laxity\nin meddlesome piety, the introduction of polite manners in the pulpit\nand classroom, and the development of even a rudimentary desire among\nthe younger people of the church to be like others outside in dress and\nspeech and deportment. They did battle as long as they could, inside\nthe fold, to restore it to the severely straight and narrow path of\nprimitive Methodism. When the adverse odds became too strong for them,\nthey quitted the church and set up a Bethel for themselves.\n\nOctavius chanced to be one of the places where they were able to hold\ntheir own within the church organization. The Methodism of the town had\ngone along without any local secession. It still held in full fellowship\nthe radicals who elsewhere had followed their unbridled bent into the\nstrongest emotional vagaries--where excited brethren worked themselves\nup into epileptic fits, and women whirled themselves about in weird\nreligious ecstasies, like dervishes of the Orient, till they\nfell headlong in a state of trance. Octavian Methodism was spared\nextravagances of this sort, it is true, but it paid a price for the\nimmunity. The people whom an open split would have taken away remained\nto leaven and dominate the whole lump. This small advanced section, with\nits men of a type all the more aggressive from its narrowness, and women\nwho went about solemnly in plain gray garments, with tight-fitting,\nunadorned, mouse-colored sunbonnets, had not been able wholly to\nenforce its views upon the social life of the church members, but of its\ncontrolling influence upon their official and public actions there could\nbe no doubt.\n\nThe situation had begun to unfold itself to Theron from the outset.\nHe had recognized the episodes of the forbidden Sunday milk and of the\nflowers in poor Alice's bonnet as typical of much more that was to\ncome. No week followed without bringing some new fulfilment of this\nforeboding. Now, at the end of two months, he knew well enough that\nthe hitherto dominant minority was hostile to him and his ministry, and\nwould do whatever it could against him.\n\nThough Theron at once decided to show fight, and did not at all waver\nin that resolve, his courage was in the main of a despondent sort.\nSometimes it would flutter up to the point of confidence, or at\nleast hopefulness, when he met with substantial men of the church who\nobviously liked him, and whom he found himself mentally ranging on his\nside, in the struggle which was to come. But more often it was blankly\napparent to him that, the moment flags were flying and drums on the\nroll, these amiable fair-weather friends would probably take to their\nheels.\n\nStill, such as they were, his sole hope lay in their support. He must\nmake the best of them. He set himself doggedly to the task of gathering\ntogether all those who were not his enemies into what, when the proper\ntime came, should be known as the pastor's party. There was plenty of\napostolic warrant for this. If there had not been, Theron felt that the\nmere elementary demands of self-defence would have justified his use of\nstrategy.\n\nThe institution of pastoral calling, particularly that inquisitorial\nform of it laid down in the Discipline, had never attracted Theron.\nHe and Alice had gone about among their previous flocks in quite a\nhaphazard fashion, without thought of system, much less of deliberate\npurpose. Theron made lists now, and devoted thought and examination to\nthe personal tastes and characteristics of the people to be cultivated.\nThere were some, for example, who would expect him to talk pretty much\nas the Discipline ordained--that is, to ask if they had family prayer,\nto inquire after their souls, and generally to minister grace to his\nhearers--and these in turn subdivided themselves into classes, ranging\nfrom those who would wish nothing else to those who needed only a mild\nspiritual flavor. There were others whom he would please much better by\nnot talking shop at all. Although he could ill afford it, he subscribed\nnow for a daily paper that he might have a perpetually renewed source of\ngood conversational topics for these more worldly calls. He also bought\nseveral pounds of candy, pleasing in color, but warranted to be entirely\nharmless, and he made a large mysterious mark on the inside of his new\nsilk hat to remind him not to go out calling without some of this in his\npocket for the children.\n\nAlice, he felt, was not helping him in this matter as effectively as he\ncould have wished. Her attitude toward the church in Octavius might best\nbe described by the word “sulky.” Great allowance was to be made, he\nrealized, for her humiliation over the flowers in her bonnet. That might\njustify her, fairly enough, in being kept away from meeting now and\nagain by headaches, or undefined megrims. But it ought not to prevent\nher from going about and making friends among the kindlier parishioners\nwho would welcome such a thing, and whom he from time to time indicated\nto her. She did go to some extent, it is true, but she produced,\nin doing so, an effect of performing a duty. He did not find traces\nanywhere of her having created a brilliant social impression. When they\nwent out together, he was peculiarly conscious of having to do the work\nunaided.\n\nThis was not at all like the Alice of former years, of other charges.\nWhy, she had been, beyond comparison, the most popular young woman in\nTyre. What possessed her to mope like this in Octavius?\n\nTheron looked at her attentively nowadays, when she was unaware of his\ngaze, to try if her face offered any answer to the riddle. It could not\nbe suggested that she was ill. Never in her life had she been looking so\nwell. She had thrown herself, all at once, and with what was to him\nan unaccountable energy, into the creation and management of a\nflower-garden. She was out the better part of every day, rain or shine,\ndigging, transplanting, pruning, pottering generally about among her\nplants and shrubs. This work in the open air had given her an aspect of\nphysical well-being which it was impossible to be mistaken about.\n\nHer husband was glad, of course, that she had found some occupation\nwhich at once pleased her and so obviously conduced to health. This was\nso much a matter of course, in fact, that he said to himself over and\nover again that he was glad. Only--only, sometimes the thought WOULD\nforce itself upon his attention that if she did not spend so much of her\ntime in her own garden, she would have more time to devote to winning\nfriends for them in the Garden of the Lord--friends whom they were going\nto need badly.\n\nThe young minister, in taking anxious stock of the chances for and\nagainst him, turned over often in his mind the fact that he had already\nwon rank as a pulpit orator. His sermons had attracted almost universal\nattention at Tyre, and his achievement before the Conference at\nTecumseh, if it did fail to receive practical reward, had admittedly\ndistanced all the other preaching there. It was a part of the evil luck\npursuing him that here in this perversely enigmatic Octavius his special\ngift seemed to be of no use whatever. There were times, indeed, when he\nwas tempted to think that bad preaching was what Octavius wanted.\n\nSomewhere he had heard of a Presbyterian minister, in charge of a big\ncity church, who managed to keep well in with a watchfully Orthodox\ncongregation, and at the same time establish himself in the affections\nof the community at large, by simply preaching two kinds of sermons. In\nthe morning, when almost all who attended were his own communicants,\nhe gave them very cautious and edifying doctrinal discourses, treading\nloyally in the path of the Westminster Confession. To the evening\nassemblages, made up for the larger part of outsiders, he addressed\nbroadly liberal sermons, literary in form, and full of respectful\nallusions to modern science and the philosophy of the day. Thus he\nfilled the church at both services, and put money in its treasury and\nhis own fame before the world. There was of course the obvious danger\nthat the pious elders who in the forenoon heard infant damnation\nvigorously proclaimed, would revolt when they heard after supper that\nthere was some doubt about even adults being damned at all. But either\nbecause the same people did not attend both services, or because the\nminister's perfect regularity in the morning was each week regarded as a\nretraction of his latest vagaries of an evening, no trouble ever came.\n\nTheron had somewhat tentatively tried this on in Octavius. It was no\ngood. His parishioners were of the sort who would have come to church\neight times a day on Sunday, instead of two, if occasion offered. The\nhope that even a portion of them would stop away, and that their places\nwould be taken in the evening by less prejudiced strangers who wished\nfor intellectual rather than theological food, fell by the wayside. The\nyearned-for strangers did not come; the familiar faces of the morning\nservice all turned up in their accustomed places every evening. They\nwere faces which confused and disheartened Theron in the daytime.\nUnder the gaslight they seemed even harder and more unsympathetic. He\ntimorously experimented with them for an evening or two, then abandoned\nthe effort.\n\nOnce there had seemed the beginning of a chance. The richest banker in\nOctavius--a fat, sensual, hog-faced old bachelor--surprised everybody\none evening by entering the church and taking a seat. Theron happened\nto know who he was; even if he had not known, the suppressed excitement\nvisible in the congregation, the way the sisters turned round to\nlook, the way the more important brethren put their heads together and\nexchanged furtive whispers--would have warned him that big game was in\nview. He recalled afterward with something like self-disgust the eager,\nalmost tremulous pains he himself took to please this banker. There was\na part of the sermon, as it had been written out, which might easily\ngive offence to a single man of wealth and free notions of life. With\nthe alertness of a mental gymnast, Theron ran ahead, excised this\nportion, and had ready when the gap was reached some very pretty general\nremarks, all the more effective and eloquent, he felt, for having\nbeen extemporized. People said it was a good sermon; and after\nthe benediction and dispersion some of the officials and principal\npew-holders remained to talk over the likelihood of a capture having\nbeen effected. Theron did not get away without having this mentioned\nto him, and he was conscious of sharing deeply the hope of the\nbrethren--with the added reflection that it would be a personal triumph\nfor himself into the bargain. He was ashamed of this feeling a little\nlater, and of his trick with the sermon. But this chastening product\nof introspection was all the fruit which the incident bore. The banker\nnever came again.\n\nTheron returned one afternoon, a little earlier than usual, from a group\nof pastoral calls. Alice, who was plucking weeds in a border at the\nshady side of the house, heard his step, and rose from her labors. He\nwas walking slowly, and seemed weary. He took off his high hat, as\nhe saw her, and wiped his brow. The broiling June sun was still high\noverhead. Doubtless it was its insufferable heat which was accountable\nfor the worn lines in his face and the spiritless air which the wife's\neye detected. She went to the gate, and kissed him as he entered.\n\n“I believe if I were you,” she said, “I'd carry an umbrella such\nscorching days as this. Nobody'd think anything of it. I don't see why a\nminister shouldn't carry one as much as a woman carries a parasol.”\n\nTheron gave her a rueful, meditative sort of smile. “I suppose people\nreally do think of us as a kind of hybrid female,” he remarked. Then,\nholding his hat in his hand, he drew a long breath of relief at finding\nhimself in the shade, and looked about him.\n\n“Why, you've got more posies here, on this one side of the house alone,\nthan mother had in her whole yard,” he said, after a little. “Let's\nsee--I know that one: that's columbine, isn't it? And that's London\npride, and that's ragged robin. I don't know any of the others.”\n\nAlice recited various unfamiliar names, as she pointed out the several\nplants which bore them, and he listened with a kindly semblance of\ninterest.\n\nThey strolled thus to the rear of the house, where thick clumps of\nfragrant pinks lined both sides of the path. She picked some of these\nfor him, and gave him more names with which to label the considerable\nnumber of other plants he saw about him.\n\n“I had no idea we were so well provided as all this,” he commented at\nlast. “Those Van Sizers must have been tremendous hands for flowers. You\nwere lucky in following such people.”\n\n“Van Sizers!” echoed Alice, with contempt. “All they left was old tomato\ncans and clamshells. Why, I've put in every blessed one of these myself,\nall except those peonies, there, and one brier on the side wall.”\n\n“Good for you!” exclaimed Theron, approvingly. Then it occurred to him\nto ask, “But where did you get them all? Around among our friends?”\n\n“Some few,” responded Alice, with a note of hesitation in her voice.\n“Sister Bult gave me the verbenas, there, and the white pinks were\na present from Miss Stevens. But most of them Levi Gorringe was good\nenough to send me--from his garden.”\n\n“I didn't know that Gorringe had a garden,” said Theron. “I thought he\nlived over his law-office, in the brick block, there.”\n\n“Well, I don't know that it's exactly HIS,” explained Alice; “but it's a\nbig garden somewhere outside, where he can have anything he likes.” She\nwent on with a little laugh: “I didn't like to question him too closely,\nfor fear he'd think I was looking a gift horse in the mouth--or else\nhinting for more. It was quite his own offer, you know. He picked them\nall out for me, and brought them here, and lent me a book telling me\njust what to do with each one. And in a few days, now, I am to have\nanother big batch of plants--dahlias and zinnias and asters and so on;\nI'm almost ashamed to take them. But it's such a change to find some one\nin this Octavius who isn't all self!”\n\n“Yes, Gorringe is a good fellow,” said Theron. “I wish he was a\nprofessing member.” Then some new thought struck him. “Alice,” he\nexclaimed, “I believe I'll go and see him this very afternoon. I don't\nknow why it hasn't occurred to me before: he's just the man whose advice\nI need most. He knows these people here; he can tell me what to do.”\n\n“Aren't you too tired now?” suggested Alice, as Theron put on his hat.\n\n“No, the sooner the better,” he replied, moving now toward the gate.\n\n“Well,” she began, “if I were you, I wouldn't say too much about--that\nis, I--but never mind.”\n\n“What is it?” asked her husband.\n\n“Nothing whatever,” replied Alice, positively. “It was only some\nnonsense of mine;” and Theron, placidly accepting the feminine whim,\nwent off down the street again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Ware found Levi Gorringe's law-office readily enough, but\nits owner was not in. He probably would be back again, though, in a\nquarter of an hour or so, the boy said, and the minister at once decided\nto wait.\n\nTheron was interested in finding that this office-boy was no other than\nHarvey--the lad who brought milk to the parsonage every morning. He\nremembered now that he had heard good things of this urchin, as to the\nhard work he did to help his mother, the Widow Semple, in her struggle\nto keep a roof over her head; and also bad things, in that he did\nnot come regularly either to church or Sunday-school. The clergyman\nrecalled, too, that Harvey had impressed him as a character.\n\n“Well, sonny, are you going to be a lawyer?” he asked, as he seated\nhimself by the window, and looked about him, first at the dusty litter\nof old papers, pamphlets, and tape-bound documents in bundles which\ncrowded the stuffy chamber, and then at the boy himself.\n\nHarvey was busy at a big box--a rough pine dry-goods box which bore the\nflaring label of an express company, and also of a well-known seed firm\nin a Western city, and which the boy had apparently just opened. He was\nlifting from it, and placing on the table after he had shaken off the\nsawdust and moss in which they were packed, small parcels of what looked\nin the fading light to be half-dried plants.\n\n“Well, I don't know--I rather guess not,” he made answer, as he pursued\nhis task. “So far as I can make out, this wouldn't be the place to start\nin at, if I WAS going to be a lawyer. A boy can learn here first-rate\nhow to load cartridges and clean a gun, and braid trout-flies on to\nleaders, but I don't see much law laying around loose. Anyway,” he went\non, “I couldn't afford to read law, and not be getting any wages. I have\nto earn money, you know.”\n\nTheron felt that he liked the boy. “Yes,” he said, with a kindly tone;\n“I've heard that you are a good, industrious youngster. I daresay Mr.\nGorringe will see to it that you get a chance to read law, and get wages\ntoo.”\n\n“Oh, I can read all there is here and welcome,” the boy explained,\nstepping toward the window to decipher the label on a bundle of roots\nin his hand, “but that's no good unless there's regular practice coming\ninto the office all the while. THAT'S how you learn to be a lawyer. But\nGorringe don't have what I call a practice at all. He just sees men in\nthe other room there, with the door shut, and whatever there is to do he\ndoes it all himself.”\n\nThe minister remembered a stray hint somewhere that Mr. Gorringe was\na money-lender--what was colloquially called a “note-shaver.” To his\nrustic sense, there was something not quite nice about that occupation.\nIt would be indecorous, he felt, to encourage further talk about it from\nthe boy.\n\n“What are you doing there?” he inquired, to change the subject.\n\n“Sorting out some plants,” replied Harvey. “I don't know what's got\ninto Gorringe lately. This is the third big box he's had since I've been\nhere--that is, in six weeks--besides two baskets full of rose-bushes.\nI don't know what he does with them. He carries them off himself\nsomewhere. I've had kind of half a notion that he's figurin' on getting\nmarried. I can't think of anything else that would make a man spend\nmoney like water--just for flowers and bushes. They do get foolish, you\nknow, when they've got marriage on the brain.”\n\nTheron found himself only imperfectly following the theories of the\nyoung philosopher. It was his fact that monopolized the minister's\nattention.\n\n“But as I understand it,” he remarked hesitatingly, “Brother\nGorringe--or rather Mr. Gorringe--gets all the plants he wants,\neverything he likes, from a big garden somewhere outside. I don't\nknow that it is exactly his; but I remember hearing something to that\neffect.”\n\nThe boy slapped the last litter off his hands, and, as he came to the\nwindow, shook his head. “These don't come from no garden outside,” he\ndeclared. “They come from the dealers', and he pays solid cash for 'em.\nThe invoice for this lot alone was thirty-one dollars and sixty cents.\nThere it is on the table. You can see it for yourself.”\n\nMr. Ware did not offer to look. “Very likely these are for the garden I\nwas speaking of,” he said. “Of course you can't go on taking plants out\nof a garden indefinitely without putting others in.”\n\n“I don't know anything about any garden that he takes plants out of,”\n answered Harvey, and looked meditatively for a minute or two out upon\nthe street below. Then he turned to the minister. “Your wife's doing a\ngood deal of gardening this spring, I notice,” he said casually. “You'd\nhardly think it was the same place, she's fixed it up so. If she wants\nany extra hoeing done, I can always get off Saturday afternoons.”\n\n“I will remember,” said Theron. He also looked out of the window; and\nnothing more was said until, a few moments later, Mr. Gorringe himself\ncame in.\n\nThe lawyer seemed both surprised and pleased at discovering the\nidentity of his visitor, with whom he shook hands in almost an excess of\ncordiality. He spread a large newspaper over the pile of seedling plants\non the table, pushed the packing-box under the table with his foot, and\nsaid almost peremptorily to the boy, “You can go now!” Then he turned\nagain to Theron.\n\n“Well, Mr. Ware, I'm glad to see you,” he repeated, and drew up a chair\nby the window. “Things are going all right with you, I hope.”\n\nTheron noted again the waving black hair, the dark skin, and the\ncarefully trimmed mustache and chin-tuft which gave the lawyer's face\na combined effect of romance and smartness. No; it was the eyes,\ncool, shrewd, dark-gray eyes, which suggested this latter quality. The\nrecollection of having seen one of them wink, in deliberate hostility\nof sarcasm, when those other trustees had their backs turned, came\nmercifully at the moment to recall the young minister to his errand.\n\n“I thought I would drop in and have a chat with you,” he said, getting\nbetter under way as he went on. “Quarterly Conference is only a\nfortnight off, and I am a good deal at sea about what is going to\nhappen.”\n\n“I'm not a church member, you know,” interposed Gorringe. “That shuts me\nout of the Quarterly Conference.”\n\n“Alas, yes!” said Theron. “I wish it didn't. I'm afraid I'm not going to\nhave any friends to spare there.”\n\n“What are you afraid of?” asked the lawyer, seeming now to be wholly at\nhis ease again “They can't eat you.”\n\n“No, they keep me too lean for that,” responded Theron, with a pensive\nsmile. “I WAS going to ask, you know, for an increase of salary, or an\nextra allowance. I don't see how I can go on as it is. The sum fixed by\nthe last Quarterly Conference of the old year, and which I am getting\nnow, is one hundred dollars less than my predecessor had. That isn't\nfair, and it isn't right. But so far from its looking as if I could get\nan increase, the prospect seems rather that they will make me pay for\nthe gas and that sidewalk. I never recovered more than about half of my\nmoving expenses, as you know, and--and, frankly, I don't know which way\nto turn. It keeps me miserable all the while.”\n\n“That's where you're wrong,” said Mr. Gorringe. “If you let things\nlike that worry you, you'll keep a sore skin all your life. You take\nmy advice and just go ahead your own gait, and let other folks do the\nworrying. They ARE pretty close-fisted here, for a fact, but you\ncan manage to rub along somehow. If you should get into any real\ndifficulties, why, I guess--” the lawyer paused to smile in a\nhesitating, significant way--“I guess some road out can be found all\nright. The main thing is, don't fret, and don't allow your wife to--to\nfret either.”\n\nHe stopped abruptly. Theron nodded in recognition of his amiable tone,\nand the found the nod lengthening itself out into almost a bow as the\nthought spread through his mind that this had been nothing more nor less\nthan a promise to help him with money if worst came to worst. He looked\nat Levi Gorringe, and said to himself that the intuition of women was\nwonderful. Alice had picked him out as a friend of theirs merely by\nseeing him pass the house.\n\n“Yes,” he said; “I am specially anxious to keep my wife from worrying.\nShe was surrounded in her girlhood by a good deal of what, relatively,\nwe should call luxury, and that makes it all the harder for her to be a\npoor minister's wife. I had quite decided to get her a hired girl, come\nwhat might, but she thinks she'd rather get on without one. Her health\nis better, I must admit, than it was when we came here. She works out in\nher garden a great deal, and that seems to agree with her.”\n\n“Octavius is a healthy place--that's generally admitted,” replied the\nlawyer, with indifference. He seemed not to be interested in Mrs. Ware's\nhealth, but looked intently out through the window at the buildings\nopposite, and drummed with his fingers on the arms of his chair.\n\nTheron made haste to revert to his errand. “Of course, your not being in\nthe Quarterly Conference,” he said, “renders certain things impossible.\nBut I didn't know but you might have some knowledge of how matters are\ngoing, what plans the officials of the church had; they seem to have\nagreed to tell me nothing.”\n\n“Well, I HAVE heard this much,” responded Gorringe. “They're figuring on\ngetting the Soulsbys here to raise the debt and kind o' shake things up\ngenerally. I guess that's about as good as settled. Hadn't you heard of\nit?”\n\n“Not a breath!” exclaimed Theron, mournfully. “Well,” he added upon\nreflection, “I'm sorry, downright sorry. The debt-raiser seems to me\nabout the lowest-down thing we produce. I've heard of those Soulsbys; I\nthink I saw HIM indeed once at Conference, but I believe SHE is the head\nof the firm.”\n\n“Yes; she wears the breeches, I understand,” said Gorringe\nsententiously.\n\n“I HAD hoped,” the young minister began with a rueful sigh, “in fact, I\nfelt quite confident at the outset that I could pay off this debt, and\nput the church generally on a new footing, by giving extra attention to\nmy pulpit work. It is hardly for me to say it, but in other places where\nI have been, my preaching has been rather--rather a feature in the town\nitself I have always been accustomed to attract to our services a good\nmany non-members, and that, as you know, helps tremendously from a money\npoint of view. But somehow that has failed here. I doubt if the average\ncongregations are a whit larger now than they were when I came in April.\nI know the collections are not.”\n\n“No,” commented the lawyer, slowly; “you'll never do anything in that\nline in Octavius. You might, of course, if you were to stay here and\nwork hard at it for five or six years--”\n\n“Heaven forbid!” groaned Mr. Ware.\n\n“Quite so,” put in the other. “The point is that the Methodists here\nare a little set by themselves. I don't know that they like one another\nspecially, but I do know that they are not what you might call popular\nwith people outside. Now, a new preacher at the Presbyterian church,\nor even the Baptist--he might have a chance to create talk, and make\na stir. But Methodist--no! People who don't belong won't come near the\nMethodist church here so long as there's any other place with a roof on\nit to go to. Give a dog a bad name, you know. Well, the Methodists here\nhave got a bad name; and if you could preach like Henry Ward Beecher\nhimself you wouldn't change it, or get folks to come and hear you.”\n\n“I see what you mean,” Theron responded. “I'm not particularly surprised\nmyself that Octavius doesn't love us, or look to us for intellectual\nstimulation. I myself leave that pulpit more often than otherwise\nfeeling like a wet rag--utterly limp and discouraged. But, if you don't\nmind my speaking of it, YOU don't belong, and yet YOU come.”\n\nIt was evident that the lawyer did not mind. He spoke freely in reply.\n“Oh, yes, I've got into the habit of it. I began going when I first came\nhere, and--and so it grew to be natural for me to go. Then, of course,\nbeing the only lawyer you have, a considerable amount of my business is\nmixed up in one way or another with your membership; you see those are\nreally the things which settle a man in a rut, and keep him there.”\n\n“I suppose your people were Methodists,” said Theron, to fill in the\npause, “and that is how you originally started with us.”\n\nLevi Gorringe shook his head. He leaned back, half closed his eyes,\nput his finger-tips together, and almost smiled as if something in\nretrospect pleased and moved him.\n\n“No,” he said; “I went to the church first to see a girl who used to\ngo there. It was long before your time. All her family moved away years\nago. You wouldn't know any of them. I was younger then, and I didn't\nknow as much as I do now. I worshipped the very ground that girl walked\non, and like a fool I never gave her so much as a hint of it. Looking\nback now, I can see that I might have had her if I'd asked her. But\nI went instead and sat around and looked at her at church and\nSunday-school and prayer-meetings Thursday nights, and class-meetings\nafter the sermon. She was devoted to religion and church work; and,\nthinking it would please her, I joined the church on probation. Men can\nfool themselves easier than they can other people. I actually believed\nat the time that I had experienced religion. I felt myself full of all\nsorts of awakenings of the soul and so forth. But it was really that\ngirl. You see I'm telling you the thing just as it was. I was very\nhappy. I think it was the happiest time of my life. I remember there was\na love-feast while I was on probation; and I sat down in front, right\nbeside her, and we ate the little square chunks of bread and drank the\nwater together, and I held one corner of her hymn-book when we stood up\nand sang. That was the nearest I ever got to her, or to full membership\nin the church. That very next week, I think it was, we learned that she\nhad got engaged to the minister's son--a young man who had just become\na minister himself. They got married, and went away--and I--somehow I\nnever took up my membership when the six months' probation was over.\nThat's how it was.”\n\n“It is very interesting,” remarked Theron, softly, after a little\nsilence--“and very full of human nature.”\n\n“Well, now you see,” said the lawyer, “what I mean when I say that there\nhasn't been another minister here since, that I should have felt like\ntelling this story to. They wouldn't have understood it at all. They\nwould have thought it was blasphemy for me to say straight out that\nwhat I took for experiencing religion was really a girl. But you are\ndifferent. I felt that at once, the first time I saw you. In a pulpit or\nout of it, what I like in a human being is that he SHOULD be human.”\n\n“It pleases me beyond measure that you should like me, then” returned\nthe young minister, with frank gratification shining on his face. “The\nworld is made all the sweeter and more lovable by these--these elements\nof romance. I am not one of those who would wish to see them banished or\nfrowned upon. I don't mind admitting to you that there is a good deal in\nMethodism--I mean the strict practice of its letter which you find here\nin Octavius--that is personally distasteful to me. I read the other day\nof an English bishop who said boldly, publicly, that no modern nation\ncould practise the principles laid down in the Sermon on the Mount and\nsurvive for twenty-four hours.”\n\n“Ha, ha! That's good!” laughed the lawyer.\n\n“I felt that it was good, too,” pursued Theron. “I am getting to see\na great many things differently, here in Octavius. Our Methodist\nDiscipline is like the Beatitudes--very helpful and beautiful, if\ntreated as spiritual suggestion, but more or less of a stumbling-block\nif insisted upon literally. I declare!” he added, sitting up in his\nchair, “I never talked like this to a living soul before in all my life.\nYour confidences were contagious.”\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Ware rose as he spoke, and took up his hat.\n\n“Must you be going?” asked the lawyer, also rising. “Well, I'm glad I\nhaven't shocked you. Come in oftener when you are passing. And if you\nsee anything I can help you in, always tell me.”\n\nThe two men shook hands, with an emphatic and lingering clasp.\n\n“I am glad,” said Theron, “that you didn't stop coming to church just\nbecause you lost the girl.”\n\nLevi Gorringe answered the minister's pleasantry with a smile which\ncurled his mustache upward, and expanded in little wrinkles at the ends\nof his eyes. “No,” he said jestingly. “I'm death on collecting debts;\nand I reckon that the church still owes me a girl. I'll have one yet.”\n\nSo, with merriment the echoes of which pleasantly accompanied Theron\ndown the stairway, the two men parted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nThough time lagged in passing with a slowness which seemed born of\nstudied insolence, there did arrive at last a day which had something\ndefinitive about it to Theron's disturbed and restless mind. It was a\nThursday, and the prayer-meeting to be held that evening would be the\nlast before the Quarterly Conference, now only four days off.\n\nFor some reason, the young minister found himself dwelling upon this\nfact, and investing it with importance. But yesterday the Quarterly\nConference had seemed a long way ahead. Today brought it alarmingly\nclose to hand. He had not heretofore regarded the weekly assemblage\nfor prayer and song as a thing calling for preparation, or for any\npreliminary thought. Now on this Thursday morning he went to his desk\nafter breakfast, which was a sign that he wanted the room to himself,\nquite as if he had the task of a weighty sermon before him. He sat at\nthe desk all the forenoon, doing no writing, it is true, but remembering\nevery once in a while, when his mind turned aside from the book in his\nhands, that there was that prayer-meeting in the evening.\n\nSometimes he reached the point of vaguely wondering why this strictly\ncommonplace affair should be forcing itself thus upon his attention.\nThen, with a kind of mental shiver at the recollection that this was\nThursday, and that the great struggle came on Monday, he would go back\nto his book.\n\nThere were a half-dozen volumes on the open desk before him. He had\ntaken them out from beneath a pile of old “Sunday-School Advocates” and\nchurch magazines, where they had lain hidden from Alice's view most of\nthe week. If there had been a locked drawer in the house, he would have\nused it instead to hold these books, which had come to him in a neat\nparcel, which also contained an amiable note from Dr. Ledsmar, recalling\na pleasant evening in May, and expressing the hope that the accompanying\nworks would be of some service. Theron had glanced at the backs of the\nuppermost two, and discovered that their author was Renan. Then he had\nhastily put the lot in the best place he could think of to escape his\nwife's observation.\n\nHe realized now that there had been no need for this secrecy. Of the\nother four books, by Sayce, Budge, Smith, and Lenormant, three indeed\nrevealed themselves to be published under religious auspices. As for\nRenan, he might have known that the name would be meaningless to Alice.\nThe feeling that he himself was not much wiser in this matter than his\nwife may have led him to pass over the learned text-books on Chaldean\nantiquity, and even the volume of Renan which appeared to be devoted\nto Oriental inscriptions, and take up his other book, entitled in\nthe translation, “Recollections of my Youth.” This he rather glanced\nthrough, at the outset, following with a certain inattention the\nintroductory sketches and essays, which dealt with an unfamiliar, and,\nto his notion, somewhat preposterous Breton racial type. Then, little by\nlittle, it dawned upon him that there was a connected story in all this;\nand suddenly he came upon it, out in the open, as it were. It was\nthe story of how a deeply devout young man, trained from his earliest\nboyhood for the sacred office, and desiring passionately nothing but\nto be worthy of it, came to a point where, at infinite cost of pain to\nhimself and of anguish to those dearest to him, he had to declare that\nhe could no longer believe at all in revealed religion.\n\nTheron Ware read this all with an excited interest which no book had\never stirred in him before. Much of it he read over and over again, to\nmake sure that he penetrated everywhere the husk of French habits of\nthought and Catholic methods in which the kernel was wrapped. He broke\noff midway in this part of the book to go out to the kitchen to dinner,\nand began the meal in silence. To Alice's questions he replied briefly\nthat he was preparing himself for the evening's prayer-meeting. She\nlifted her brows in such frank surprise at this that he made a further\nand somewhat rambling explanation about having again taken up the work\non his book--the book about Abraham.\n\n“I thought you said you'd given that up altogether,” she remarked.\n\n“Well,” he said, “I WAS discouraged about it for a while. But a man\nnever does anything big without getting discouraged over and over again\nwhile he's doing it. I don't say now that I shall write precisely\nTHAT book--I'm merely reading scientific works about the period, just\nnow--but if not that, I shall write some other book. Else how will you\nget that piano?” he added, with an attempt at a smile.\n\n“I thought you had given that up, too!” she replied ruefully. Then\nbefore he could speak, she went on: “Never mind the piano; that can\nwait. What I've got on my mind just now isn't piano; it's potatoes.\nDo you know, I saw some the other day at Rasbach's, splendid\npotatoes--these are some of them--and fifteen cents a bushel cheaper\nthan those dried-up old things Brother Barnum keeps, and so I bought two\nbushels. And Sister Barnum met me on the street this morning, and threw\nit in my face that the Discipline commands us to trade with each other.\nIs there any such command?”\n\n“Yes,” said the husband. “It's Section 33. Don't you remember? I looked\nit up in Tyre. We are to 'evidence our desire of salvation by doing\ngood, especially to them that are of the household of faith, or groaning\nso to be; by employing them preferably to others; buying one of another;\nhelping each other in business'--and so on. Yes, it's all there.”\n\n“Well, I told her I didn't believe it was,” put in Alice, “and I said\nthat even if it was, there ought to be another section about selling\npotatoes to their minister for more than they're worth--potatoes that\nturn all green when you boil them, too. I believe I'll read up that old\nDiscipline myself, and see if it hasn't got some things that I can talk\nback with.”\n\n“The very section before that, Number 32, enjoins members against\n'uncharitable or unprofitable conversation--particularly speaking evil\nof magistrates or ministers.' You'd have 'em there, I think.” Theron had\nbegun cheerfully enough, but the careworn, preoccupied look returned now\nto his face. “I'm sorry if we've fallen out with the Barnums,” he said.\n“His brother-in-law, Davis, the Sunday-school superintendent, is a\nmember of the Quarterly Conference, you know, and I've been hoping that\nhe was on my side. I've been taking a good deal of pains to make up to\nhim.”\n\nHe ended with a sigh, the pathos of which impressed Alice. “If you think\nit will do any good,” she volunteered, “I'll go and call on the Davises\nthis very afternoon. I'm sure to find her at home,--she's tied hand\nand foot with that brood of hers--and you'd better give me some of that\ncandy for them.”\n\nTheron nodded his approval and thanks, and relapsed into silence. When\nthe meal was over, he brought out the confectionery to his wife, and\nwithout a word went back to that remarkable book.\n\nWhen Alice returned toward the close of day, to prepare the simple tea\nwhich was always laid a half-hour earlier on Thursdays and Sundays,\nshe found her husband where she had left him, still busy with those new\nscientific works. She recounted to him some incidents of her call\nupon Mrs. Davis, as she took off her hat and put on the big kitchen\napron--how pleased Mrs. Davis seemed to be; how her affection for\nher sister-in-law, the grocer's wife, disclosed itself to be not even\nskin-deep; how the children leaped upon the candy as if they had never\nseen any before; and how, in her belief, Mr. Davis would be heart and\nsoul on Theron's side at the Conference.\n\nTo her surprise, the young minister seemed not at all interested.\nHe hardly looked at her during her narrative, but reclined in the\neasy-chair with his head thrown back, and an abstracted gaze wandering\naimlessly about the ceiling. When she avowed her faith in the\nSunday-school superintendent's loyal partisanship, which she did with\na pardonable pride in having helped to make it secure, her husband even\nclosed his eyes, and moved his head with a gesture which plainly bespoke\nindifference.\n\n“I expected you'd be tickled to death,” she remarked, with evident\ndisappointment.\n\n“I've a bad headache,” he explained, after a minute's pause.\n\n“No wonder!” Alice rejoined, sympathetically enough, but with a note of\nreproof as well. “What can you expect, staying cooped up in here all day\nlong, poring over those books? People are all the while remarking that\nyou study too much. I tell them, of course, that you're a great hand for\nreading, and always were; but I think myself it would be better if you\ngot out more, and took more exercise, and saw people. You know lots\nand slathers more than THEY do now, or ever will, if you never opened\nanother book.”\n\nTheron regarded her with an expression which she had never seen on his\nface before. “You don't realize what you are saying,” he replied slowly.\nHe sighed as he added, with increased gravity, “I am the most ignorant\nman alive!”\n\nAlice began a little laugh of wifely incredulity, and then let it die\naway as she recognized that he was really troubled and sad in his mind.\nShe bent over to kiss him lightly on the brow, and tiptoed her way out\ninto the kitchen.\n\n“I believe I will let you make my excuses at the prayer-meeting this\nevening,” he said all at once, as the supper came to an end. He\nhad eaten next to nothing during the meal, and had sat in a sort of\nbrown-study from which Alice kindly forbore to arouse him. “I don't\nknow--I hardly feel equal to it. They won't take it amiss--for once--if\nyou explain to them that I--I am not at all well.”\n\n“Oh, I do hope you're not coming down with anything!” Alice had risen\ntoo, and was gazing at him with a solicitude the tenderness of which at\nonce comforted, and in some obscure way jarred on his nerves. “Is there\nanything I can do--or shall I go for a doctor? We've got mustard in the\nhouse, and senna--I think there's some senna left--and Jamaica ginger.”\n\nTheron shook his head wearily at her. “Oh, no,--no!” he expostulated.\n“It isn't anything that needs drugs, or doctors either. It's just mental\nworry and fatigue, that's all. An evening's quiet rest in the big chair,\nand early to bed--that will fix me up all right.”\n\n“But you'll read; and that will make your head worse,” said Alice.\n\n“No, I won't read any more,” he promised her, walking slowly into the\nsitting-room, and settling himself in the big chair, the while she\nbrought out a pillow from the adjoining best bedroom, and adjusted it\nbehind his head. “That's nice! I'll just lie quiet here, and perhaps\ndoze a little till you come back. I feel in the mood for the rest; it\nwill do me all sorts of good.”\n\nHe closed his eyes; and Alice, regarding his upturned face anxiously,\ndecided that already it looked more at peace than awhile ago.\n\n“Well, I hope you'll be better when I get back,” she said, as she began\npreparations for the evening service. These consisted in combing\nstiffly back the strands of light-brown hair which, during the day, had\nexuberantly loosened themselves over her temples into something\nalmost like curls; in fastening down upon this rebellious hair a plain\nbrown-straw bonnet, guiltless of all ornament save a binding ribbon of\ndull umber hue; and in putting on a thin dark-gray shawl and a pair\nof equally subdued lisle-thread gloves. Thus attired, she made a\nmischievous little grimace of dislike at her puritanical image in\nthe looking-glass over the mantel, and then turned to announce her\ndeparture.\n\n“Well, I'm off,” she said. Theron opened his eyes to take in this figure\nof his wife dressed for prayer-meeting, and then closed them again\nabruptly. “All right,” he murmured, and then he heard the door shut\nbehind her.\n\nAlthough he had been alone all day, there seemed to be quite a unique\nvalue and quality in this present solitude. He stretched out his legs on\nthe opposite chair, and looked lazily about him, with the feeling that\nat last he had secured some leisure, and could think undisturbed to his\nheart's content. There were nearly two hours of unbroken quiet before\nhim; and the mere fact of his having stepped aside from the routine of\nhis duty to procure it; marked it in his thoughts as a special occasion,\nwhich ought in the nature of things to yield more than the ordinary\nharvest of mental profit.\n\nTheron's musings were broken in upon from time to time by rumbling\noutbursts of hymn-singing from the church next door. Surely, he said to\nhimself, there could be no other congregation in the Conference, or in\nall Methodism, which sang so badly as these Octavians did. The noise,\nas it came to him now and again, divided itself familiarly into a main\nstrain of hard, high, sharp, and tinny female voices, with three or four\nconcurrent and clashing branch strains of part-singing by men who did\nnot know how. How well he already knew these voices! Through two wooden\nwalls he could detect the conceited and pushing note of Brother Lovejoy,\nwho tried always to drown the rest out, and the lifeless, unmeasured\nweight of shrill clamor which Sister Barnum hurled into every chorus,\nhalf closing her eyes and sticking out her chin as she did so. They\ndrawled their hymns too, these people, till Theron thought he understood\nthat injunction in the Discipline against singing too slowly. It had\npuzzled him heretofore; now he felt that it must have been meant in\nprophecy for Octavius.\n\nIt was impossible not to recall in contrast that other church music\nhe had heard, a month before, and the whole atmosphere of that other\npastoral sitting room, from which he had listened to it. The startled\nand crowded impressions of that strange evening had been lying hidden\nin his mind all this while, driven into a corner by the pressure of more\nordinary, everyday matters. They came forth now, and passed across\nhis brain--no longer confusing and distorted, but in orderly and\nintelligible sequence. Their earlier effect had been one of frightened\nfascination. Now he looked them over calmly as they lifted themselves,\none by one, and found himself not shrinking at all, or evading anything,\nbut dwelling upon each in turn as a natural and welcome part of the most\nimportant experience of his life.\n\nThe young minister had arrived, all at once, at this conclusion. He did\nnot question at all the means by which he had reached it. Nothing was\nclearer to his mind than the conclusion itself--that his meeting, with\nthe priest and the doctor was the turning-point in his career. They had\nlifted him bodily out of the slough of ignorance, of contact with low\nminds and sordid, narrow things, and put him on solid ground. This book\nhe had been reading--this gentle, tender, lovable book, which had as\nmuch true piety in it as any devotional book he had ever read, and yet,\nunlike all devotional books, put its foot firmly upon everything which\ncould not be proved in human reason to be true--must be merely one of a\nthousand which men like Father Forbes and Dr. Ledsmar knew by heart. The\nvery thought that he was on the way now to know them, too, made Theron\ntremble. The prospect wooed him, and he thrilled in response, with the\nwistful and delicate eagerness of a young lover.\n\nSomehow, the fact that the priest and the doctor were not religious men,\nand that this book which had so impressed and stirred him was nothing\nmore than Renan's recital of how he, too, ceased to be a religious man,\ndid not take a form which Theron could look square in the face. It wore\nthe shape, instead, of a vague premise that there were a great many\ndifferent kinds of religions--the past and dead races had multiplied\nthese in their time literally into thousands--and that each no doubt had\nits central support of truth somewhere for the good men who were in it,\nand that to call one of these divine and condemn all the others was\na part fit only for untutored bigots. Renan had formally repudiated\nCatholicism, yet could write in his old age with the deepest filial\naffection of the Mother Church he had quitted. Father Forbes could talk\ncoolly about the “Christ-myth” without even ceasing to be a priest,\nand apparently a very active and devoted priest. Evidently there was an\nintellectual world, a world of culture and grace, of lofty thoughts\nand the inspiring communion of real knowledge, where creeds were not of\nimportance, and where men asked one another, not “Is your soul saved?”\n but “Is your mind well furnished?” Theron had the sensation of having\nbeen invited to become a citizen of this world. The thought so dazzled\nhim that his impulses were dragging him forward to take the new oath\nof allegiance before he had had time to reflect upon what it was he was\nabandoning.\n\nThe droning of the Doxology from the church outside stirred Theron\nsuddenly out of his revery. It had grown quite dark, and he rose and lit\nthe gas. “Blest be the Tie that Binds,” they were singing. He paused,\nwith hand still in air, to listen. That well-worn phrase arrested his\nattention, and gave itself a new meaning. He was bound to those people,\nit was true, but he could never again harbor the delusion that the tie\nbetween them was blessed. There was vaguely present in his mind the\nconsciousness that other ties were loosening as well. Be that as it\nmight, one thing was certain. He had passed definitely beyond pretending\nto himself that there was anything spiritually in common between him and\nthe Methodist Church of Octavius. The necessity of his keeping up the\npretence with others rose on the instant like a looming shadow before\nhis mental vision. He turned away from it, and bent his brain to think\nof something else.\n\nThe noise of Alice opening the front door came as a pleasant digression.\nA second later it became clear from the sound of voices that she had\nbrought some one back with her, and Theron hastily stretched himself out\nagain in the armchair, with his head back in the pillow, and his feet\non the other chair. He had come mighty near forgetting that he was an\ninvalid, and he protected himself the further now by assuming an air of\nlassitude verging upon prostration.\n\n“Yes; there's a light burning. It's all right,” he heard Alice say. She\nentered the room, and Theron's head was too bad to permit him to turn\nit, and see who her companion was.\n\n“Theron dear,” Alice began, “I knew you'd be glad to see HER, even if\nyou were out of sorts; and I persuaded her just to run in for a minute.\nLet me introduce you to Sister Soulsby. Sister Soulsby--my husband.”\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Ware sat upright with an energetic start, and fastened upon\nthe stranger a look which conveyed anything but the satisfaction his\nwife had been so sure about. It was at the first blush an undisguised\nscowl, and only some fleeting memory of that reflection about needing\nnow to dissemble, prevented him from still frowning as he rose to his\nfeet, and perfunctorily held out his hand.\n\n“Delighted, I'm sure,” he mumbled. Then, looking up, he discovered that\nSister Soulsby knew he was not delighted, and that she seemed not to\nmind in the least.\n\n“As your good lady said, I just ran in for a moment,” she remarked,\nshaking his limp hand with a brisk, business-like grasp, and dropping\nit. “I hate bothering sick people, but as we're to be thrown together\na good deal this next week or so, I thought I'd like to lose no time in\nsaying 'howdy.' I won't keep you up now. Your wife has been sweet enough\nto ask me to move my trunk over here in the morning, so that you'll see\nenough of me and to spare.”\n\nTheron looked falteringly into her face, as he strove for words which\nshould sufficiently mask the disgust this intelligence stirred within\nhim. A debt-raiser in the town was bad enough! A debt-raiser quartered\nin the very parsonage!--he ground his teeth to think of it.\n\nAlice read his hesitation aright. “Sister Soulsby went to the hotel,”\n she hastily put in; “and Loren Pierce was after her to come and stay at\nhis house, and I ventured to tell her that I thought we could make her\nmore comfortable here.” She accompanied this by so daring a grimace\nand nod that her husband woke up to the fact that a point in Conference\npolitics was involved.\n\nHe squeezed a doubtful smile upon his features. “We shall both do our\nbest,” he said. It was not easy, but he forced increasing amiability\ninto his glance and tone. “Is Brother Soulsby here, too?” he asked.\n\nThe debt-raiser shook her head--again the prompt, decisive movement, so\nlike a busy man of affairs. “No,” she answered. “He's doing supply\ndown on the Hudson this week, but he'll be here in time for the Sunday\nmorning love-feast. I always like to come on ahead, and see how the land\nlies. Well, good-night! Your head will be all right in the morning.”\n\nPrecisely what she meant by this assurance, Theron did not attempt to\nguess. He received her adieu, noted the masterful manner in which\nshe kissed his wife, and watched her pass out into the hall, with the\nfeeling uppermost that this was a person who decidedly knew her way\nabout. Much as he was prepared to dislike her, and much as he detested\nthe vulgar methods her profession typified, he could not deny that she\nseemed a very capable sort of woman.\n\nThis mental concession did not prevent his fixing upon Alice, when she\nreturned to the room, a glance of obvious disapproval.\n\n“Theron,” she broke forth, to anticipate his reproach, “I did it for the\nbest. The Pierces would have got her if I hadn't cut in. I thought it\nwould help to have her on our side. And, besides, I like her. She's the\nfirst sister I've seen since we've been in this hole that's had a kind\nword for me--or--or sympathized with me! And--and--if you're going to be\noffended--I shall cry!”\n\nThere were real tears on her lashes, ready to make good the threat.\n“Oh, I guess I wouldn't,” said Theron, with an approach to his old,\nhalf-playful manner. “If you like her, that's the chief thing.”\n\nAlice shook her tear-drops away. “No,” she replied, with a wistful\nsmile; “the chief thing is to have her like you. She's as smart as a\nsteel trap--that woman is--and if she took the notion, I believe she\ncould help get us a better place.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nThe ensuing week went by with a buzz and whirl, circling about Theron\nWare's dizzy consciousness like some huge, impalpable teetotum sent\nspinning under Sister Soulsby's resolute hands. Whenever his vagrant\nmemory recurred to it, in after months, he began by marvelling, and\nended with a shudder of repulsion.\n\nIt was a week crowded with events, which seemed to him to shoot past\nso swiftly that in effect they came all of a heap. He never essayed the\ntask, in retrospect, of arranging them in their order of sequence. They\nhad, however, a definite and interdependent chronology which it is worth\nthe while to trace.\n\nMrs. Soulsby brought her trunk round to the parsonage bright and early\non Friday morning, and took up her lodgement in the best bedroom,\nand her headquarters in the house at large, with a cheerful and\nbusiness-like manner. She desired nothing so much, she said, as that\npeople should not put themselves out on her account, or allow her to\nget in their way. She appeared to mean this, too, and to have very good\nideas about securing its realization.\n\nDuring both Friday and the following day, indeed, Theron saw her only at\nthe family meals. There she displayed a hearty relish for all that was\nset before her which quite won Mrs. Ware's heart, and though she talked\nrather more than Theron found himself expecting from a woman, he could\nnot deny that her conversation was both seemly and entertaining. She had\nevidently been a great traveller, and referred to things she had seen in\nSavannah or Montreal or Los Angeles in as matter-of-fact fashion as\nhe could have spoken of a visit to Tecumseh. Theron asked her many\nquestions about these and other far-off cities, and her answers were\nall so pat and showed so keen and clear an eye that he began in spite of\nhimself to think of her with a certain admiration.\n\nShe in turn plied him with inquiries about the principal pew-holders\nand members of his congregation--their means, their disposition, and the\nmeasure of their devotion. She put these queries with such intelligence,\nand seemed to assimilate his replies with such an alert understanding,\nthat the young minister was spurred to put dashes of character in\nhis descriptions, and set forth the idiosyncrasies and distinguishing\nearmarks of his flock with what he felt afterward might have been too\nfree a tongue. But at the time her fine air of appreciation led him\ncaptive. He gossiped about his parishioners as if he enjoyed it. He\nmade a specially happy thumb-nail sketch for her of one of his trustees,\nErastus Winch, the loud-mouthed, ostentatiously jovial, and really\ncold-hearted cheese-buyer. She was particularly interested in hearing\nabout this man. The personality of Winch seemed to have impressed her,\nand she brought the talk back to him more than once, and prompted Theron\nto the very threshold of indiscretion in his confidences on the subject.\n\nSave at meal-times, Sister Soulsby spent the two days out around among\nthe Methodists of Octavius. She had little or nothing to say about\nwhat she thus saw and heard, but used it as the basis for still further\ninquiries. She told more than once, however, of how she had been pressed\nhere or there to stay to dinner or supper, and how she had excused\nherself. “I've knocked about too much,” she would explain to the Wares,\n“not to fight shy of random country cooking. When I find such a born\ncook as you are--well I know when I'm well off.” Alice flushed with\npleased pride at this, and Theron himself felt that their visitor showed\ngreat good sense. By Saturday noon, the two women were calling each\nother by their first names. Theron learned with a certain interest that\nSister Soulsby's Christian name was Candace.\n\nIt was only natural that he should give even more thought to her than to\nher quaint and unfamiliar old Ethiopian name. She was undoubtedly a very\nsmart woman. To his surprise she had never introduced in her talk any of\nthe stock religious and devotional phrases which official Methodists\nso universally employed in mutual converse. She might have been an\ninsurance agent, or a school-teacher, visiting in a purely secular\nhousehold, so little parade of cant was there about her.\n\nHe caught himself wondering how old she was. She seemed to have been\npretty well over the whole American continent, and that must take years\nof time. Perhaps, however, the exertion of so much travel would tend\nto age one in appearance. Her eyes were still youthful--decidedly\nwise eyes, but still juvenile. They had sparkled with almost girlish\nmerriment at some of his jokes. She turned them about a good deal when\nshe spoke, making their glances fit and illustrate the things she said.\nHe had never met any one whose eyes played so constant and prominent a\npart in their owner's conversation. Theron had never seen a play; but\nhe had encountered the portraits of famous queens of the drama several\ntimes in illustrated papers or shop windows, and it occurred to him that\nsome of the more marked contortions of Sister Soulsby's eyes--notably\na trick she had of rolling them swiftly round and plunging them, so to\nspeak, into an intent, yearning, one might almost say devouring, gaze\nat the speaker--were probably employed by eminent actresses like Ristori\nand Fanny Davenport.\n\nThe rest of Sister Soulsby was undoubtedly subordinated in interest to\nthose eyes of hers. Sometimes her face seemed to be reviving temporarily\na comeliness which had been constant in former days; then again it would\nlook decidedly, organically, plain. It was the worn and loose-skinned\nface of a nervous, middle-aged woman, who had had more than her share of\ntrouble, and drank too much tea. She wore the collar of her dress rather\nlow; and Theron found himself wondering at this, because, though long\nand expansive, her neck certainly showed more cords and cavities than\nconsorted with his vague ideal of statuesque beauty. Then he wondered at\nhimself for thinking about it, and abruptly reined up his fancy, only to\nfind that it was playing with speculations as to whether her yellowish\ncomplexion was due to that tea-drinking or came to her as a legacy of\nSouthern blood.\n\nHe knew that she was born in the South because she said so. From the\nsame source he learned that her father had been a wealthy planter, who\nwas ruined by the war, and sank into a premature grave under the weight\nof his accumulated losses. The large dark rings around her eyes\ngrew deeper still in their shadows when she told about this, and her\nordinarily sharp voice took on a mellow cadence, with a soft, drawling\naccent, turning U's into O's, and having no R's to speak of. Theron had\nimbibed somewhere in early days the conviction that the South was the\nland of romance, of cavaliers and gallants and black eyes flashing\nbehind mantillas and outspread fans, and somehow when Sister Soulsby\nused this intonation she suggested all these things.\n\nBut almost all her talk was in another key--a brisk, direct, idiomatic\nmanner of speech, with an intonation hinting at no section in\nparticular. It was merely that of the city-dweller as distinguished from\nthe rustic. She was of about Alice's height, perhaps a shade taller.\nIt did not escape the attention of the Wares that she wore clothes of a\nmore stylish cut and a livelier arrangement of hues than any Alice had\never dared own, even in lax-minded Tyre. The two talked of this in their\nroom on Friday night; and Theron explained that congregations would\ntolerate things of this sort with a stranger which would be sharply\nresented in the case of local folk whom they controlled. It was on this\noccasion that Alice in turn told Theron she was sure Mrs. Soulsby had\nfalse teeth--a confidence which she immediately regretted as an act of\ntreachery to her sex.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, toward evening, Brother Soulsby arrived, and was\nguided to the parsonage by his wife, who had gone to the depot to meet\nhim. They must have talked over the situation pretty thoroughly on the\nway, for by the time the new-comer had washed his face and hands and\nput on a clean collar, Sister Soulsby was ready to announce her plan of\ncampaign in detail.\n\nHer husband was a man of small stature and, like herself, of uncertain\nage. He had a gentle, if rather dry, clean-shaven face, and wore his\ndust-colored hair long behind. His little figure was clad in black\nclothes of a distinctively clerical fashion, and he had a white\nneck-cloth neatly tied under his collar. The Wares noted that he looked\nclean and amiable rather than intellectually or spiritually powerful, as\nhe took the vacant seat between theirs, and joined them in concentrating\nattention upon Mrs. Soulsby.\n\nThis lady, holding herself erect and alert on the edge of the low, big\neasy-chair had the air of presiding over a meeting.\n\n“My idea is,” she began, with an easy implication that no one else's\nidea was needed, “that your Quarterly Conference, when it meets on\nMonday, must be adjourned to Tuesday. We will have the people all out\ntomorrow morning to love-feast, and announcement can be made there, and\nat the morning service afterward, that a series of revival meetings are\nto be begun that same evening. Mr. Soulsby and I can take charge in the\nevening, and we'll see to it that THAT packs the house--fills the church\nto overflowing Monday evening. Then we'll quietly turn the meeting into\na debt-raising convention, before they know where they are, and we'll\nwipe off the best part of the load. Now, don't you see,” she turned her\neyes full upon Theron as she spoke, “you want to hold your Quarterly\nConference AFTER this money's been raised, not before.”\n\n“I see what you mean,” Mr. Ware responded gravely. “But--”\n\n“But what!” Sister Soulsby interjected, with vivacity.\n\n“Well,” said Theron, picking his words, “in the first place, it rests\nwith the Presiding Elder to say whether an adjournment can be made until\nTuesday, not with me.”\n\n“That's all right. Leave that to me,” said the lady.\n\n“In the second place,” Theron went on, still more hesitatingly, “there\nseems a certain--what shall I say?--indirection in--in--”\n\n“In getting them together for a revival, and springing a debt-raising on\nthem?” Sister Soulsby put in. “Why, man alive, that's the best part of\nit. You ought to be getting some notion by this time what these Octavius\nfolks of yours are like. I've only been here two days, but I've got\ntheir measure down to an allspice. Supposing you were to announce\ntomorrow that the debt was to be raised Monday. How many men with\nbank-accounts would turn up, do you think? You could put them all in\nyour eye, sir--all in your eye!”\n\n“Very possibly you're right,” faltered the young minister.\n\n“Right? Why, of course I'm right,” she said, with placid confidence.\n“You've got to take folks as you find them; and you've got to find them\nthe best way you can. One place can be worked, managed, in one way,\nand another needs quite a different way, and both ways would be dead\nfrosts--complete failures--in a third.”\n\nBrother Soulsby coughed softly here, and shuffled his feet for an\ninstant on the carpet. His wife resumed her remarks with slightly abated\nanimation, and at a slower pace.\n\n“My experience,” she said, “has shown me that the Apostle was right.\nTo properly serve the cause, one must be all things to all men. I have\nknown very queer things indeed turn out to be means of grace. You\nsimply CAN'T get along without some of the wisdom of the serpent. We are\ncommanded to have it, for that matter. And now, speaking of that, do\nyou know when the Presiding Elder arrives in town today, and where he is\ngoing to eat supper and sleep?”\n\nTheron shook his head. “All I know is he isn't likely to come here,” he\nsaid, and added sadly, “I'm afraid he's not an admirer of mine.”\n\n“Perhaps that's not all his fault,” commented Sister Soulsby. “I'll tell\nyou something. He came in on the same train as my husband, and that old\ntrustee Pierce of yours was waiting for him with his buggy, and I saw\nlike a flash what was in the wind, and the minute the train stopped I\ncaught the Presiding Elder, and invited him in your name to come\nright here and stay; told him you and Alice were just set on his\ncoming--wouldn't take no for an answer. Of course he couldn't come--I\nknew well enough he had promised old Pierce--but we got in our\ninvitation anyway, and it won't do you any harm. Now, that's what I call\nhaving some gumption--wisdom of the serpent, and so on.”\n\n“I'm sure,” remarked Alice, “I should have been mortified to death if he\nhad come. We lost the extension-leaf to our table in moving, and four is\nall it'll seat decently.”\n\nSister Soulsby smiled winningly into the wife's honest face. “Don't you\nsee, dear,” she explained patiently, “I only asked him because I knew\nhe couldn't come. A little butter spreads a long way, if it's only\nintelligently warmed.”\n\n“It was certainly very ingenious of you,” Theron began almost stiffly.\nThen he yielded to the humanities, and with a kindling smile added,\n“And it was as kind as kind could be. I'm afraid you're wrong about\nit's doing me any good, but I can see how well you meant it, and I'm\ngrateful.”\n\n“We COULD have sneaked in the kitchen table, perhaps, while he was out\nin the garden, and put on the extra long tablecloth,” interjected Alice,\nmusingly.\n\nSister Soulsby smiled again at Sister Ware, but without any words this\ntime; and Alice on the instant rose, with the remark that she must be\ngoing out to see about supper.\n\n“I'm going to insist on coming out to help you,” Mrs. Soulsby declared,\n“as soon as I've talked over one little matter with your husband. Oh,\nyes, you must let me this time. I insist!”\n\nAs the kitchen door closed behind Mrs. Ware, a swift and apparently\nsignificant glance shot its way across from Sister Soulsby's roving,\neloquent eyes to the calmer and smaller gray orbs of her husband. He\nrose to his feet, made some little explanation about being a gardener\nhimself, and desiring to inspect more closely some rhododendrons he had\nnoticed in the garden, and forthwith moved decorously out by the other\ndoor into the front hall. They heard his footsteps on the gravel beneath\nthe window before Mrs. Soulsby spoke again.\n\n“You're right about the Presiding Elder, and you're wrong,” she said.\n“He isn't what one might call precisely in love with you. Oh, I know the\nstory--how you got into debt at Tyre, and he stepped in and insisted on\nyour being denied Tecumseh and sent here instead.”\n\n“HE was responsible for that, then, was he?” broke in Theron, with\ncontracted brows.\n\n“Why, don't you make any effort to find out anything at ALL?” she asked\npertly enough, but with such obvious good-nature that he could not but\nhave pleasure in her speech. “Why, of course he did it! Who else did you\nsuppose?”\n\n“Well,” said the young minister, despondently, “if he's as much against\nme as all that, I might as well hang up my fiddle and go home.”\n\nSister Soulsby gave a little involuntary groan of impatience. She\nbent forward, and, lifting her eyes, rolled them at him in a curve of\ndownward motion which suggested to his fancy the image of two eagles in\na concerted pounce upon a lamb.\n\n“My friend,” she began, with a new note of impressiveness in her voice,\n“if you'll pardon my saying it, you haven't got the spunk of a mouse.\nIf you're going to lay down, and let everybody trample over you just as\nthey please, you're right! You MIGHT as well go home. But now here, this\nis what I wanted to say to you: Do you just keep your hands off these\nnext few days, and leave this whole thing to me. I'll pull it into\nshipshape for you. No--wait a minute--don't interrupt now. I have taken\na liking to you. You've got brains, and you've got human nature in you,\nand heart. What you lack is SABE--common-sense. You'll get that, too, in\ntime, and meanwhile I'm not going to stand by and see you cut up and fed\nto the dogs for want of it. I'll get you through this scrape, and put\nyou on your feet again, right-side-up-with care, because, as I said, I\nlike you. I like your wife, too, mind. She's a good, honest little soul,\nand she worships the very ground you tread on. Of course, as long as\npeople WILL marry in their teens, the wrong people will get yoked up\ntogether. But that's neither here nor there. She's a kind sweet little\nbody, and she's devoted to you, and it isn't every intellectual man\nthat gets even that much. But now it's a go, is it? You promise to keep\nquiet, do you, and leave the whole show absolutely to me? Shake hands on\nit.”\n\nSister Soulsby had risen, and stood now holding out her hand in a frank,\nmanly fashion. Theron looked at the hand, and made mental notes that\nthere were a good many veins discernible on the small wrist, and that\nthe forearm seemed to swell out more than would have been expected in a\nwoman producing such a general effect of leanness. He caught the\nshine of a thin bracelet-band of gold under the sleeve. A delicate,\nsignificant odor just hinted its presence in the air about this\noutstretched arm--something which was not a perfume, yet deserved as\ngracious a name.\n\nHe rose to his feet, and took the proffered hand with a deliberate\ngesture, as if he had been cautiously weighing all the possible\narguments for and against this momentous compact.\n\n“I promise,” he said gravely, and the two palms squeezed themselves\ntogether in an earnest clasp.\n\n“Right you are,” exclaimed the lady, once more with cheery vivacity.\n“Mind, when it's all over, I'm going to give you a good, serious,\ndownright talking to--a regular hoeing-over. I'm not sure I shan't give\nyou a sound shaking into the bargain. You need it. And now I'm going out\nto help Alice.”\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Ware remained standing after his new friend had\nleft the room, and his meditative face wore an even unusual air of\nabstraction. He strolled aimlessly over, after a time, to the desk by\nthe window, and stood there looking out at the slight figure of Brother\nSoulsby, who was bending over and attentively regarding some pink\nblossoms on a shrub through what seemed to be a pocket magnifying-glass.\n\nWhat remained uppermost in his mind was not this interesting woman's\nconfident pledge of championship in his material difficulties. He found\nhimself dwelling instead upon her remark about the incongruous results\nof early marriages. He wondered idly if the little man in the white\ntie, fussing out there over that rhododendron-bush, had figured in her\nthoughts as an example of these evils. Then he reflected that they had\nbeen mentioned in clear relation to talk about Alice.\n\nNow that he faced this question, it was as if he had been consciously\nignoring and putting it aside for a long time. How was it, he asked\nhimself now, that Alice, who had once seemed so bright and keen-witted,\nwho had in truth started out immeasurably his superior in swiftness of\napprehension and readiness in humorous quips and conceits, should\nhave grown so dull? For she was undoubtedly slow to understand things\nnowadays. Her absurd lugging in of the extension-table problem, when\nthe great strategic point of that invitation foisted upon the\nPresiding Elder came up, was only the latest sample of a score of these\nheavy-minded exhibitions that recalled themselves to him. And outsiders\nwere apparently beginning to notice it. He knew by intuition what\nthose phrases, “good, honest little soul” and “kind, sweet little body”\n signified, when another woman used them to a husband about his wife. The\nvery employment of that word “little” was enough, considering that there\nwas scarcely more than a hair's difference between Mrs. Soulsby and\nAlice, and that they were both rather tall than otherwise, as the\nstature of women went.\n\nWhat she had said about the chronic misfortunes of intellectual men in\nsuch matters gave added point to those meaning phrases. Nobody could\ndeny that geniuses and men of conspicuous talent had as a rule, all\nthrough history, contracted unfortunate marriages. In almost every case\nwhere their wives were remembered at all, it was on account of their\nabnormal stupidity, or bad temper, or something of that sort. Take\nXantippe, for example, and Shakespeare's wife, and--and--well, there was\nByron, and Bulwer-Lytton, and ever so many others.\n\nOf course there was nothing to be done about it. These things happened,\nand one could only put the best possible face on them, and live one's\nappointed life as patiently and contentedly as might be. And Alice\nundoubtedly merited all the praise which had been so generously bestowed\nupon her. She was good and honest and kindly, and there could be no\ndoubt whatever as to her utter devotion to him. These were tangible,\nsolid qualities, which must always secure respect for her. It was true\nthat she no longer seemed to be very popular among people. He questioned\nwhether men, for instance, like Father Forbes and Dr. Ledsmar would care\nmuch about her. Visions of the wifeless and academic calm in which\nthese men spent their lives--an existence consecrated to literature and\nknowledge and familiarity with all the loftiest and noblest thoughts of\nthe past--rose and enveloped him in a cloud of depression. No such\nlot would be his! He must labor along among ignorant and spiteful\nnarrow-minded people to the end of his days, pocketing their insults and\nfawning upon the harsh hands of jealous nonentities who happened to\nbe his official masters, just to keep a roof over his head--or rather\nAlice's. He must sacrifice everything to this, his ambitions, his\npassionate desires to do real good in the world on a large scale,\nhis mental freedom, yes, even his chance of having truly elevating,\nintellectual friendships. For it was plain enough that the men whose\nfriendship would be of genuine and stimulating profit to him would not\nlike her. Now that he thought of it, she seemed latterly to make no\nfriends at all.\n\nSuddenly, as he watched in a blank sort of way Brother Soulsby take\nout a penknife, and lop an offending twig from a rose-bush against the\nfence, something occurred to him. There was a curious exception to\nthat rule of Alice's isolation. She had made at least one friend. Levi\nGorringe seemed to like her extremely.\n\nAs if his mind had been a camera, Theron snapped a shutter down upon\nthis odd, unbidden idea, and turned away from the window.\n\nThe sounds of an active, almost strenuous conversation in female voices\ncame from the kitchen. Theron opened the door noiselessly, and put in\nhis head, conscious of something furtive in his intention.\n\n“You must dreen every drop of water off the spinach, mind, before you\nput it over, or else--”\n\nIt was Sister Soulsby's sharp and penetrating tones which came to him.\nTheron closed the door again, and surrendered himself once more to the\ncircling whirl of his thoughts.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nA love-feast at nine in the morning opened the public services of a\nSunday still memorable in the annals of Octavius Methodism.\n\nThis ceremony, which four times a year preceded the sessions of the\nQuarterly Conference, was not necessarily an event of importance. It\nwas an occasion upon which the brethren and sisters who clung to the\nold-fashioned, primitive ways of the itinerant circuit-riders, let\nthemselves go with emphasized independence, putting up more vehement\nprayers than usual, and adding a special fervor of noise to their\n“Amens!” and other interjections--and that was all.\n\nIt was Theron's first love-feast in Octavius, and as the big class-room\nin the church basement began to fill up, and he noted how the men with\nultra radical views and the women clad in the most ostentatious drabs\nand grays were crowding into the front seats, he felt his spirits\nsinking. He had literally to force himself from sentence to sentence,\nwhen the time came for him to rise and open the proceedings with an\nexhortation. He had eagerly offered this function to the Presiding\nElder, the Rev. Aziel P. Larrabee, who sat in severe silence on the\nlittle platform behind him, but had been informed that the dignitary\nwould lead off in giving testimony later on. So Theron, feeling all the\nwhile the hostile eyes of the Elder burning holes in his back, dragged\nhimself somehow through the task. He had never known any such difficulty\nof speech before. The relief was almost overwhelming when he came to\nthe customary part where all are adjured to be as brief as possible in\nwitnessing for the Lord, because the time belongs to all the people, and\nthe Discipline forbids the feast to last more than ninety minutes. He\ndelivered this injunction to brevity with marked earnestness, and then\nsat down abruptly.\n\nThere was some rather boisterous singing, during which the stewards,\nbeginning with the platform, passed plates of bread cut in small\ncubes, and water in big plated pitchers and tumblers, about among\nthe congregation, threading their way between the long wooden benches\nordinarily occupied at this hour by the children of the Sunday-school,\nand helping each brother and sister in turn. They held by the old\ncustom, here in Octavius, and all along the seats the sexes alternated,\nas they do at a polite dinner-table.\n\nTheron impassively watched the familiar scene. The early nervousness had\npassed away. He felt now that he was not in the least afraid of these\npeople, even with the Presiding Elder thrown in. Folks who sang with\nsuch unintelligence, and who threw themselves with such undignified\nfervor into this childish business of the bread and water, could not\nbe formidable antagonists for a man of intellect. He had never realized\nbefore what a spectacle the Methodist love-feast probably presented to\noutsiders. What must they think of it!\n\nHe had noticed that the Soulsbys sat together, in the centre and toward\nthe front. Next to Brother Soulsby sat Alice. He thought she looked pale\nand preoccupied, and set it down in passing to her innate distaste for\nthe somber garments she was wearing, and for the company she perforce\nfound herself in. Another head was in the way, and for a time Theron did\nnot observe who sat beside Alice on the other side. When at last he saw\nthat it was Levi Gorringe, his instinct was to wonder what the lawyer\nmust be saying to himself about these noisy and shallow enthusiasts. A\nrecurring emotion of loyalty to the simple people among whom, after all,\nhe had lived his whole life, prompted him to feel that it wasn't wholly\nnice of Gorringe to come and enjoy this revelation of their foolish\nside, as if it were a circus. There was some vague memory in his mind\nwhich associated Gorringe with other love-feasts, and with a cynical\nattitude toward them. Oh, yes! he had told how he went to one just for\nthe sake of sitting beside the girl he admired--and was pursuing.\n\nThe stewards had completed their round, and the loud, discordant singing\ncame to an end. There ensued a little pause, during which Theron turned\nto the Presiding Elder with a gesture of invitation to take charge\nof the further proceedings. The Elder responded with another gesture,\ncalling his attention to something going on in front.\n\nBrother and Sister Soulsby, to the considerable surprise of everybody,\nhad risen to their feet, and were standing in their places, quite\nmotionless, and with an air of professional self-assurance dimly\ndiscernible under a large show of humility. They stood thus until\ncomplete silence had been secured. Then the woman, lifting her head,\nbegan to sing. The words were “Rock of Ages,” but no one present had\nheard the tune to which she wedded them. Her voice was full and very\nsweet, and had in it tender cadences which all her hearers found\ntouching. She knew how to sing, and she put forth the words so that each\nwas distinctly intelligible. There came a part where Brother Soulsby,\nlifting his head in turn, took up a tuneful second to her air. Although\nthe two did not, as one could hear by listening closely, sing the same\nwords at the same time, they produced none the less most moving and\ndelightful harmonies of sound.\n\nThe experience was so novel and charming that listeners ran ahead in\ntheir minds to fix the number of verses there were in the hymn, and\nto hope that none would be left out. Toward the end, when some of the\nintolerably self-conceited local singers, fancying they had caught the\ntune, started to join in, they were stopped by an indignant “sh-h!”\n which rose from all parts of the class-room; and the Soulsbys, with a\npatient and pensive kindliness written on their uplifted faces, gave\nthat verse over again.\n\nWhat followed seemed obviously restrained and modified by the effect of\nthis unlooked-for and tranquillizing overture. The Presiding Elder\nwas known to enjoy visits to old-fashioned congregations like that\nof Octavius, where he could indulge to the full his inner passion for\nhigh-pitched passionate invocations and violent spiritual demeanor, but\nthis time he spoke temperately, almost soothingly. The most tempestuous\nof the local witnesses for the Lord gave in their testimony in\nrelatively pacific tones, under the influence of the spell which good\nmusic had laid upon the gathering. There was the deepest interest as to\nwhat the two visitors would do in this way. Brother Soulsby spoke first,\nvery briefly and in well rounded and well-chosen, if conventional,\nphrases. His wife, following him, delivered in a melodious monotone some\nequally hackneyed remarks. The assemblage, listening in rapt attention,\nfelt the suggestion of reserved power in every sentence she uttered, and\nburst forth, as she dropped into her seat, in a loud chorus of approving\nejaculations. The Soulsbys had captured Octavius with their first outer\nskirmish line.\n\nEverything seemed to move forward now with a new zest and spontaneity.\nTheron had picked out for the occasion the best of those sermons which\nhe had prepared in Tyre, at the time when he was justifying his ambition\nto be accounted a pulpit orator. It was orthodox enough, but had been\nplanned as the framework for picturesque and emotional rhetoric rather\nthan doctrinal edification. He had never dreamed of trying it on\nOctavius before, and only on the yesterday had quavered at his own\ndaring in choosing it now. Nothing but the desire to show Sister Soulsby\nwhat was in him had held him to the selection.\n\nSomething of this same desire no doubt swayed and steadied him now in\nthe pulpit. The labored slowness of his beginning seemed to him to be\ndue to nervous timidity, until suddenly, looking down into those big\neyes of Sister Soulsby's, which were bent gravely upon him from where\nshe sat beside Alice in the minister's pew, he remembered that it was\ninstead the studied deliberation which art had taught him. He went on,\nfeeling more and more that the skill and histrionic power of his best\ndays were returning to him, were as marked as ever--nay, had never\ntriumphed before as they were triumphing now. The congregation watched\nand listened with open, steadfast eyes and parted lips. For the first\ntime in all that weary quarter, their faces shone. The sustaining\nsparkle of their gaze lifted him to a peroration unrivalled in his own\nrecollection of himself.\n\nHe sat down, and bent his head forward upon the open Bible, breathing\nhard, but suffused with a glow of satisfaction. His ears caught the\nmusic of that sighing rustle through the audience which bespeaks a\nprofound impression. He could scarcely keep the fingers of his hands,\ncovering his bowed face in a devotional posture as they were, from\ndrumming a jubilant tattoo. His pulses did this in every vein, throbbing\nwith excited exultation. The insistent whim seized him, as he still\nbent thus before his people, to whisper to his own heart, “At last!--The\ndogs!”\n\nThe announcement that in the evening a series of revival meetings was to\nbe inaugurated, had been made at the love-feast, and it was repeated\nnow from the pulpit, with the added statement that for the once\nthe class-meetings usually following this morning service would be\nsuspended. Then Theron came down the steps, conscious after a fashion\nthat the Presiding Elder had laid a propitiatory hand on his shoulder\nand spoken amiably about the sermon, and that several groups of more or\nless important parishioners were waiting in the aisle and the vestibule\nto shake hands and tell him how much they had enjoyed the sermon. His\nmind perversely kept hold of the thought that all this came too late. He\npolitely smiled his way along out, and, overtaking the Soulsbys and his\nwife near the parsonage gate, went in with them.\n\nAt the cold, picked-up noonday meal which was the Sunday rule of the\nhouse, Theron rather expected that his guests would talk about the\nsermon, or at any rate about the events of the morning. A Sabbath chill\nseemed to have settled upon both their tongues. They ate almost in\nsilence, and their sparse remarks touched upon topics far removed from\nchurch affairs. Alice too, seemed strangely disinclined to conversation.\nThe husband knew her face and its varying moods so well that he could\nsee she was laboring under some very powerful and deep emotion. No doubt\nit was the sermon, the oratorical swing of which still tingled in his\nown blood, that had so affected her. If she had said so, it would have\npleased him, but she said nothing.\n\nAfter dinner, Brother Soulsby disappeared in his bedroom, with the\nremark that he guessed he would lie down awhile. Sister Soulsby put\non her bonnet, and, explaining that she always prepared herself for an\nevening's work by a long solitary walk, quitted the house. Alice, after\nshe had put the dinner things away, went upstairs, and stayed there.\nLeft to himself, Theron spent the afternoon in the easy-chair, and,\nin the intervals of confused introspection, read “Recollections of my\nYouth” through again from cover to cover.\n\nHe went through the remarkable experiences attending the opening of the\nrevival, when evening came, as one in a dream. Long before the hour for\nthe service arrived, the sexton came in to tell him that the church was\nalready nearly full, and that it was going to be impossible to present\nany distinction in the matter of pews. When the party from the parsonage\nwent over--after another cold and mostly silent meal--it was to find the\ninterior of the church densely packed, and people being turned away from\nthe doors.\n\nTheron was supposed to preside over what followed, and he did sit on\nthe central chair in the pulpit, between the Presiding Elder and Brother\nSoulsby, and on the several needful occasions did rise and perfunctorily\nmake the formal remarks required of him. The Elder preached a short,\nbut vigorously phrased sermon. The Soulsbys sang three or four times--on\neach occasion with familiar hymnal words set to novel, concerted\nmusic--and then separately exhorted the assemblage. The husband's part\nseemed well done. If his speech lacked some of the fire of the divine\ngirdings which older Methodists recalled, it still led straight, and\nwith kindling fervency, up to a season of power. The wife took up the\nword as he sat down. She had risen from one of the side-seats; and,\nspeaking as she walked, she moved forward till she stood within the\naltar-rail, immediately under the pulpit, and from this place, facing\nthe listening throng, she delivered her harangue. Those who watched\nher words most intently got the least sense of meaning from them.\nThe phrases were all familiar enough--“Jesus a very present help,”\n “Sprinkled by the Blood,” “Comforted by the Word,” “Sanctified by the\nSpirit,” “Born into the Kingdom,” and a hundred others--but it was as in\nthe case of her singing: the words were old; the music was new.\n\nWhat Sister Soulsby said did not matter. The way she said it--the\nsplendid, searching sweep of her great eyes; the vibrating roll of\nher voice, now full of tears, now scornful, now boldly, jubilantly\ntriumphant; the sympathetic swaying of her willowy figure under the\nstress of her eloquence--was all wonderful. When she had finished, and\nstood, flushed and panting, beneath the shadow of the pulpit, she\nheld up a hand deprecatingly as the resounding “Amens!” and “Bless the\nLords!” began to well up about her.\n\n“You have heard us sing,” she said, smiling to apologize for her\nshortness of breath. “Now we want to hear you sing!”\n\nHer husband had risen as she spoke, and on the instant, with a far\ngreater volume of voice than they had hitherto disclosed, the two began\n“From Greenland's Icy Mountains,” in the old, familiar tune. It did\nnot need Sister Soulsby's urgent and dramatic gesture to lift people to\ntheir feet. The whole assemblage sprang up, and, under the guidance of\nthese two powerful leading voices, thundered the hymn out as Octavius\nhad never heard it before.\n\nWhile its echoes were still alive, the woman began speaking again.\n“Don't sit down!” she cried. “You would stand up if the President of the\nUnited States was going by, even if he was only going fishing. How much\nmore should you stand up in honor of living souls passing forward to\nfind their Saviour!”\n\nThe psychological moment was upon them. Groans and cries arose, and\na palpable ferment stirred the throng. The exhortation to sinners\nto declare themselves, to come to the altar, was not only on the\nrevivalist's lips: it seemed to quiver in the very air, to be borne on\nevery inarticulate exclamation in the clamor of the brethren. A young\nwoman, with a dazed and startled look in her eyes, rose in the body of\nthe church tremblingly hesitated for a moment, and then, with bowed head\nand blushing cheeks, pressed her way out from the end of a crowded\npew and down the aisle to the rail. A triumphant outburst of welcoming\nejaculations swelled to the roof as she knelt there, and under its\nimpetus others followed her example. With interspersed snatches of song\nand shouted encouragements the excitement reached its height only when\ntwoscore people, mostly young, were tightly clustered upon their knees\nabout the rail, and in the space opening upon the aisle. Above the\nconfusion of penitential sobs and moans, and the hysterical murmurings\nof members whose conviction of entire sanctity kept them in their seats,\ncould be heard the voices of the Presiding Elder, the Soulsbys, and\nthe elderly deacons of the church, who moved about among the kneeling\nmourners, bending over them and patting their shoulders, and calling\nout to them: “Fasten your thoughts on Jesus!” “Oh, the Precious Blood!”\n “Blessed be His Name!” “Seek Him, and you shall find Him!” “Cling to\nJesus, and Him Crucified!”\n\nThe Rev. Theron Ware did not, with the others, descend from the pulpit.\nSeated where he could not see Sister Soulsby, he had failed utterly to\nbe moved by the wave of enthusiasm she had evoked. What he heard her say\ndisappointed him. He had expected from her more originality, more spice\nof her own idiomatic, individual sort. He viewed with a cold sense of\naloofness the evidences of her success when they began to come forward\nand abase themselves at the altar. The instant resolve that, come what\nmight, he would not go down there among them, sprang up ready-made in\nhis mind. He saw his two companions pass him and descend the pulpit\nstairs, and their action only hardened his resolution. If an excuse were\nneeded, he was presiding, and the place to preside in was the pulpit.\nBut he waived in his mind the whole question of an excuse.\n\nAfter a little, he put his hand over his face, leaning the elbow forward\non the reading-desk. The scene below would have thrilled him to the\nmarrow six months--yes, three months ago. He put a finger across his\neyes now, to half shut it out. The spectacle of these silly young\n“mourners”--kneeling they knew not why, trembling at they could not tell\nwhat, pledging themselves frantically to dogmas and mysteries they knew\nnothing of, under the influence of a hubbub of outcries as meaningless\nin their way, and inspiring in much the same way, as the racket of a\nfife and drum corps--the spectacle saddened and humiliated him now.\nHe was conscious of a dawning sense of shame at being even tacitly\nresponsible for such a thing. His fancy conjured up the idea of Dr.\nLedsmar coming in and beholding this maudlin and unseemly scene, and he\nfelt his face grow hot at the bare thought.\n\nLooking through his fingers, Theron all at once saw something which\ncaught at his breath with a sharp clutch. Alice had risen from the\nminister's pew--the most conspicuous one in the church--and was moving\ndown the aisle toward the rail, her uplifted face chalk-like in its\nwhiteness, and her eyes wide-open, looking straight ahead.\n\nThe young pastor could scarcely credit his sight. He thrust aside his\nhand, and bent forward, only to see his wife sink upon her knees among\nthe rest, and to hear this notable accession to the “mourners” hailed\nby a tumult of approving shouts. Then, remembering himself, he drew back\nand put up his hand, shutting out the strange scene altogether. To see\nnothing at all was a relief, and under cover he closed his eyes, and bit\nhis teeth together.\n\nA fresh outburst of thanksgivings, spreading noisily through the\ncongregation, prompted him to peer through his fingers again. Levi\nGorringe was making his way down the aisle--was at the moment quite in\nfront. Theron found himself watching this man with the stern composure\nof a fatalist. The clamant brethren down below were stirred to new\nexcitement by the thought that the sceptical lawyer, so long with them,\nyet not of them, had been humbled and won by the outpourings of the\nSpirit. Theron's perceptions were keener. He knew that Gorringe was\ncoming forward to kneel beside Alice; The knowledge left him curiously\nundisturbed. He saw the lawyer advance, gently insinuate himself past\nthe form of some kneeling mourner who was in his way, and drop on his\nknees close beside the bowed figure of Alice. The two touched shoulders\nas they bent forward beneath Sister Soulsby's outstretched hands, held\nover them as in a blessing. Theron looked fixedly at them, and professed\nto himself that he was barely interested.\n\nA little afterward, he was standing up in his place, and reading aloud\na list of names which one of the stewards had given him. They were the\nnames of those who had asked that evening to be taken into the church\nas members on probation. The sounds of the recent excitement were all\nhushed now, save as two or three enthusiasts in a corner raised their\nvoices in abrupt greeting of each name in its turn, but Theron felt\nsomehow that this noise had been transferred to the inside of his head.\nA continuous buzzing went on there, so that the sound of his voice was\nfar-off and unfamiliar in his ears.\n\nHe read through the list--comprising some fifteen items--and pronounced\nthe names with great distinctness. It was necessary to take pains with\nthis, because the only name his blurred eyes seemed to see anywhere on\nthe foolscap sheet was that of Levi Gorringe. When he had finished and\nwas taking his seat, some one began speaking to him from the body of the\nchurch. He saw that this was the steward, who was explaining to him that\nthe most important name of the lot--that of Brother Gorringe--had not\nbeen read out.\n\nTheron smiled and shook his head. Then, when the Presiding Elder touched\nhim on the arm, and assured him that he had not mentioned the name in\nquestion, he replied quite simply, and with another smile, “I thought it\nwas the only name I did read out.”\n\nThen he sat down abruptly, and let his head fall to one side. There\nwere hurried movements inside the pulpit, and people in the audience had\nbegun to stand up wonderingly, when the Presiding Elder, with uplifted\nhands, confronted them.\n\n“We will omit the Doxology, and depart quietly after the benediction,”\n he said. “Brother Ware seems to have been overcome by the heat.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nWhen Theron woke next morning, Alice seemed to have dressed and left the\nroom--a thing which had never happened before.\n\nThis fact connected itself at once in his brain with the recollection\nof her having made an exhibition of herself the previous evening--going\nforward before all eyes to join the unconverted and penitent sinners, as\nif she were some tramp or shady female, instead of an educated lady, a\nprofessing member from her girlhood, and a minister's wife. It crossed\nhis mind that probably she had risen and got away noiselessly, for very\nshame at looking him in the face, after such absurd behavior.\n\nThen he remembered more, and grasped the situation. He had fainted in\nchurch, and had been brought home and helped to bed. Dim memories of\nunaccustomed faces in the bedroom, of nauseous drugs and hushed voices,\ncame to him out of the night-time. Now that he thought of it, he was a\nsick man. Having settled this, he went off to sleep again, a feverish\nand broken sleep, and remained in this state most of the time for the\nfollowing twenty-four hours. In the brief though numerous intervals of\nwaking, he found certain things clear in his mind. One was that he was\nannoyed with Alice, but would dissemble his feelings. Another was that\nit was much pleasanter to be ill than to be forced to attend and take\npart in those revival meetings. These two ideas came and went in a lazy,\ndrowsy fashion, mixing themselves up with other vagrant fancies, yet\nalways remaining on top.\n\nIn the evening the singing from the church next door filled his room.\nThe Soulsbys' part of it was worth keeping awake for. He turned over and\ndeliberately dozed when the congregation sang.\n\nAlice came up a number of times during the day to ask how he felt, and\nto bring him broth or toast-water. On several occasions, when he heard\nher step, the perverse inclination mastered him to shut his eyes, and\npretend to be asleep, so that she might tip-toe out again. She had a\ndepressed and thoughtful air, and spoke to him like one whose mind was\non something else. Neither of them alluded to what had happened the\nprevious evening. Toward the close of the long day, she came to ask him\nwhether he would prefer her to remain in the house, instead of attending\nthe meeting.\n\n“Go, by all means,” he said almost curtly.\n\nThe Presiding Elder and the Sunday-school superintendent called early\nTuesday morning at the parsonage to make brotherly inquiries, and\nTheron was feeling so much better that he himself suggested their\ncoming upstairs to see him. The Elder was in good spirits; he\nsmiled approvingly, and even put in a jocose word or two while the\nsuperintendent sketched for the invalid in a cheerful way the leading\nincidents of the previous evening.\n\nThere had been an enormous crowd, even greater than that of Sunday\nnight, and everybody had been looking forward to another notable and\nexciting season of grace. These expectations were especially heightened\nwhen Sister Soulsby ascended the pulpit stairs and took charge of the\nproceedings. She deferred to Paul's views about women preachers on\nSundays, she said; but on weekdays she had just as much right to snatch\nbrands from the burning as Paul, or Peter, or any other man. She went\non like that, in a breezy, off-hand fashion which tickled the audience\nimmensely, and led to the liveliest anticipations of what would happen\nwhen she began upon the evening's harvest of souls.\n\nBut it was something else that happened. At a signal from Sister Soulsby\nthe steward got up, and, in an unconcerned sort of way, went through the\nthrong to the rear of the church, locked the doors, and put the keys\nin their pockets. The sister dryly explained now to the surprised\ncongregation that there was a season for all things, and that on the\npresent occasion they would suspend the glorious work of redeeming\nfallen human nature, and take up instead the equally noble task of\nraising some fifteen hundred dollars which the church needed in its\nbusiness. The doors would only be opened again when this had been\naccomplished.\n\nThe brethren were much taken aback by this trick, and they permitted\nthemselves to exchange a good many scowling and indignant glances, the\nwhile their professional visitors sang another of their delightfully\nnovel sacred duets. Its charm of harmony for once fell upon\nunsympathetic ears. But then Sister Soulsby began another monologue,\ndefending this way of collecting money, chaffing the assemblage with\nbright-eyed impudence on their having been trapped, and scoring,\none after another, neat and jocose little personal points on local\ncharacteristics, at which everybody but the individual touched grinned\nbroadly. She was so droll and cheeky, and withal effective in her talk,\nthat she quite won the crowd over. She told a story about a woodchuck\nwhich fairly brought down the house.\n\n“A man,” she began, with a quizzical twinkle in her eye, “told me once\nabout hunting a woodchuck with a pack of dogs, and they chased it so\nhard that it finally escaped only by climbing a butternut-tree. 'But, my\nfriend,' I said to him, 'woodchucks can't climb trees--butternut-trees\nor any other kind--and you know it!' All he said in reply to me was:\n'This woodchuck had to climb a tree!' And that's the way with this\ncongregation. You think you can't raise $1,500, but you've GOT to.”\n\nSo it went on. She set them all laughing; and then, with a twist of the\neyes and a change of voice, lo, and behold, she had them nearly crying\nin the same breath. Under the pressure of these jumbled emotions,\nbrethren began to rise up in their pews and say what they would give.\nThe wonderful woman had something smart and apt to say about each fresh\ncontribution, and used it to screw up the general interest a notch\nfurther toward benevolent hysteria. With songs and jokes and impromptu\nexhortations and prayers she kept the thing whirling, until a sort of\nduel of generosity began between two of the most unlikely men--Erastus\nWinch and Levi Gorringe. Everybody had been surprised when Winch gave\nhis first $50; but when he rose again, half an hour afterward, and said\nthat, owing to the high public position of some of the new members on\nprobation, he foresaw a great future for the church, and so felt moved\nto give another $25, there was general amazement. Moved by a common\ninstinct, all eyes were turned upon Levi Gorringe, and he, without the\nslightest hesitation, stood up and said he would give $100. There was\nsomething in his tone which must have annoyed Brother Winch, for he shot\nup like a dart, and called out, “Put me down for fifty more;” and that\nbrought Gorringe to his feet with an added $50, and then the two went\non raising each other till the assemblage was agape with admiring\nstupefaction.\n\nThis gladiatorial combat might have been going on till now, the\nSunday-school superintendent concluded, if Winch hadn't subsided. The\namount of the contributions hadn't been figured up yet, for Sister\nSoulsby kept the list; but there had been a tremendous lot of money\nraised. Of that there could be no doubt.\n\nThe Presiding Elder now told Theron that the Quarterly Conference had\nbeen adjourned yesterday till today. He and Brother Davis were even now\non their way to attend the session in the church next door. The Elder\nadded, with an obvious kindly significance, that though Theron was too\nill to attend it, he guessed his absence would do him no harm. Then the\ntwo men left the room, and Theron went to sleep again.\n\nAnother almost blank period ensued, this time lasting for forty-eight\nhours. The young minister was enfolded in the coils of a fever of some\nsort, which Brother Soulsby, who had dabbled considerably in medicine,\nadmitted that he was puzzled about. Sometimes he thought that it was\ntyphoid, and then again there were symptoms which looked suspiciously\nlike brain fever. The Methodists of Octavius counted no physician among\ntheir numbers, and when, on the second day, Alice grew scared, and\ndecided, with Brother Soulsby's assent, to call in professional advice,\nthe only doctor's name she could recall was that of Ledsmar. She was\nconscious of an instinctive dislike for the vague image of him her fancy\nhad conjured up, but the reflection that he was Theron's friend, and so\nprobably would be more moderate in his charges, decided her.\n\nBrother Soulsby showed a most comforting tact and swiftness of\napprehension when Alice, in mentioning Dr. Ledsmar's name, disclosed by\nher manner a fear that his being sent for would create talk among the\nchurch people. He volunteered at once to act as messenger himself, and,\nwith no better guide than her dim hints at direction, found the doctor\nand brought him back to the parsonage.\n\nDr. Ledsmar expressly disclaimed to Soulsby all pretence of professional\nskill, and made him understand that he went along solely because\nhe liked Mr. Ware, and was interested in him, and in any case would\nprobably be of as much use as the wisest of strange physicians--a view\nwhich the little revivalist received with comprehending nods of tacit\nacquiescence. Ledsmar came, and was taken up to the sick-room. He sat\non the bedside and talked with Theron awhile, and then went downstairs\nagain. To Alice's anxious inquiries, he replied that it seemed to him\nmerely a case of over-work and over-worry, about which there was not the\nslightest occasion for alarm.\n\n“But he says the strangest things,” the wife put in. “He has been quite\ndelirious at times.”\n\n“That means only that his brain is taking a rest as well as his body,”\n remarked Ledsmar. “That is Nature's way of securing an equilibrium of\nrepose--of recuperation. He will come out of it with his mind all the\nfresher and clearer.”\n\n“I don't believe he knows shucks!” was Alice's comment when she closed\nthe street door upon Dr. Ledsmar. “Anybody could have come in and looked\nat a sick man and said, 'Leave him alone.' You expect something more\nfrom a doctor. It's his business to say what to do. And I suppose he'll\ncharge two dollars for just telling me that my husband was resting!”\n\n“No,” said Brother Soulsby, “he said he never practised, and that he\nwould come only as a friend.”\n\n“Well, it isn't my idea of a friend--not to prescribe a single thing,”\n protested Alice.\n\nYet it seemed that no prescription was needed, after all. The next\nmorning Theron woke to find himself feeling quite restored in spirits\nand nerves. He sat up in bed, and after an instant of weakly giddiness,\nrecognized that he was all right again. Greatly pleased, he got up,\nand proceeded to dress himself. There were little recurring hints of\nfaintness and vertigo, while he was shaving, but he had the sense\nto refer these to the fact that he was very, very hungry. He went\ndownstairs, and smiled with the pleased pride of a child at the surprise\nwhich his appearance at the door created. Alice and the Soulsbys were\nat breakfast. He joined them, and ate voraciously, declaring that it was\nworth a month's illness to have things taste so good once more.\n\n“You still look white as a sheet,” said Alice, warningly. “If I were\nyou, I'd be careful in my diet for a spell yet.”\n\nFor answer, Theron let Sister Soulsby help him again to ham and eggs.\nHe talked exclusively to Sister Soulsby, or rather invited her by\nhis manner to talk to him, and listened and watched her with indolent\ncontent. There was a sort of happy and purified languor in his physical\nand mental being, which needed and appreciated just this--to sit next a\nbright and attractive woman at a good breakfast, and be ministered to by\nher sprightly conversation, by the flash of her informing and inspiring\neyes, and the nameless sense of support and repose which her near\nproximity exhaled. He felt himself figuratively leaning against Sister\nSoulsby's buoyant personality, and resting.\n\nBrother Soulsby, like the intelligent creature he was, ate his breakfast\nin peace; but Alice would interpose remarks from time to time. Theron\nwas conscious of a certain annoyance at this, and knew that he was\nshowing it by an exaggerated display of interest in everything Sister\nSoulsby said, and persisted in it. There trembled in the background of\nhis thoughts ever and again the recollection of a grievance against\nhis wife--an offence which she had committed--but he put it aside as\nsomething to be grappled and dealt with when he felt again like taking\nup the serious and disagreeable things of life. For the moment, he\ndesired only to be amused by Sister Soulsby. Her casual mention of the\nfact that she and her husband were taking their departure that very day,\nappealed to him as an added reason for devoting his entire attention to\nher.\n\n“You mustn't forget that famous talking-to you threatened me with--that\n'regular hoeing-over,' you know,” he reminded her, when he found\nhimself alone with her after breakfast. He smiled as he spoke, in frank\nenjoyment of the prospect.\n\nSister Soulsby nodded, and aided with a roll of her eyes the effect of\nmock-menace in her uplifted forefinger. “Oh, never fear,” she cried.\n“You'll catch it hot and strong. But that'll keep till afternoon.\nTell me, do you feel strong enough to go in next door and attend the\ntrustees' meeting this forenoon? It's rather important that you should\nbe there, if you can spur yourself up to it. By the way, you haven't\nasked what happened at the Quarterly Conference yesterday.”\n\nTheron sighed, and made a little grimace of repugnance. “If you knew how\nlittle I cared!” he said. “I did hope you'd forget all about mentioning\nthat--and everything else connected with--the next door. You talk so\nmuch more interestingly about other things.”\n\n“Here's gratitude for you!” exclaimed Sister Soulsby, with a gay\nsimulation of despair. “Why, man alive, do you know what I've done for\nyou? I got around on the Presiding Elder's blind side, I captured old\nPierce, I wound Winch right around my little finger, I worked two or\nthree of the class-leaders--all on your account. The result was you\nwent through as if you'd had your ears pinned back, and been greased all\nover. You've got an extra hundred dollars added to your salary; do you\nhear? On the sixth question of the order of business the Elder ruled\nthat the recommendation of the last conference's estimating committee\ncould be revised (between ourselves he was wrong, but that doesn't\nmatter), and so you're in clover. And very friendly things were said\nabout you, too.”\n\n“It was very kind of you,” said Theron. “I am really extremely grateful\nto you.” He shook her by the hand to make up for what he realized to be\na lack of fervor in his tones.\n\n“Well, then,” Sister Soulsby replied, “you pull yourself together, and\ntake your place as chairman of the trustees' meeting, and see to it\nthat, whatever comes up, you side with old Pierce and Winch.”\n\n“Oh, THEY'RE my friends now, are they?” asked Theron, with a faint play\nof irony about his lips.\n\n“Yes, that's your ticket this election,” she answered briskly, “and mind\nyou vote it straight. Don't bother about reasons now. Just take it from\nme, as the song says, 'that things have changed since Willie died.'\nThat's all. And then come back here, and this afternoon we'll have a\ngood old-fashioned jaw.”\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Ware, walking with ostentatious feebleness, and forcing\na conventional smile upon his wan face, duly made his unexpected\nappearance at the trustees' meeting in one of the smaller classrooms. He\nreceived their congratulations gravely, and shook hands with all three.\nIt required an effort to do this impartially, because, upon sight of\nLevi Gorringe, there rose up suddenly within him an emotion of fierce\ndislike and enmity. In some enigmatic way his thoughts had kept\nthemselves away from Gorringe ever since Sunday evening. Now they\nconcentrated with furious energy and swiftness upon him. Theron\nseemed able in a flash of time to coordinate many recollections of\nGorringe--the early liking Alice had professed for him, the mystery of\nthose purchased plants in her garden, the story of the girl he had lost\nin church, his offer to lend him money, the way in which he had sat\nbeside Alice at the love-feast and followed her to the altar-rail in\nthe evening. These raced abreast through the young minister's brain, yet\nwith each its own image, and its relation to the others clearly defined.\n\nHe found the nerve, all the same, to take this third trustee by the\nhand, and to thank him for his congratulations, and even to say, with a\nsurface smile of welcome, “It is BROTHER Gorringe, now, I remember.”\n\nThe work before the meeting was chiefly of a routine kind. In most\nplaces this would have been transacted by the stewards; but in Octavius\nthese minor officials had degenerated into mere ceremonial abstractions,\nwho humbly ratified, or by arrangement anticipated, the will of the\npowerful, mortgage-owning trustees. Theron sat languidly at the head\nof the table while these common-place matters passed in their course,\nnoting the intonations of Gorringe's voice as he read from his\nsecretary's book, and finding his ear displeased by them. No issue arose\nupon any of these trivial affairs, and the minister, feeling faint\nand weary in the heat, wondered why Sister Soulsby had insisted on his\ncoming.\n\nAll at once he sat up straight, with an instinctive warning in his\nmind that here was the thing. Gorringe had taken up the subject of the\n“debt-raising” evening, and read out its essentials as they had been\nembodied in a report of the stewards. The gross sum obtained, in cash\nand promises, was $1,860. The stewards had collected of this a trifle\nless than half, but hoped to get it all in during the ensuing quarter.\nThere were, also, the bill of Mr. and Mrs. Soulsby for $150, and the\nincreases of $100 in the pastor's salary and $25 in the apportioned\ncontribution of the charge toward the Presiding Elder's maintenance, the\ntwo latter items of which the Quarterly Conference had sanctioned.\n\n“I want to hear the names of the subscribers and their amounts read\nout,” put in Brother Pierce.\n\nWhen this was done, it became apparent that much more than half of the\nentire amount had been offered by two men. Levi Gorringe's $450 and\nErastus Winch's $425 left only $985 to be divided up among some seventy\nor eighty other members of the congregation.\n\nBrother Pierce speedily stopped the reading of these subordinate names.\n“They're of no concern whatever,” he said, despite the fact that his\nown might have been reached in time. “Those first names are what I was\ngetting at. Have those two first amounts, the big ones, be'n paid?”\n\n“One has--the other not,” replied Gorringe.\n\n“PRE-cisely,” remarked the senior trustee. “And I'm goin' to move that\nit needn't be paid, either. When Brother Winch, here, began hollerin'\nout those extra twenty-fives and fifties, that evening, it was under a\ncomplete misapprehension. He'd be'n on the Cheese Board that same Monday\nafternoon, and he'd done what he thought was a mighty big stroke of\nbusiness, and he felt liberal according. I know just what that feelin'\nis myself. If I'd be'n makin' a mint o' money, instead o' losin' all the\nwhile, as I do, I'd 'a' done just the same. But the next day, lo, and\nbehold, Brother Winch found that it was all a mistake--he hadn't made a\nsingle penny.”\n\n“Fact is, I lost by the whole transaction,” put in Erastus Winch,\ndefiantly.\n\n“Just so,” Brother Pierce went on. “He lost money. You have his own word\nfor it. Well, then, I say it would be a burning shame for us to consent\nto touch one penny of what he offered to give, in the fullness of his\nheart, while he was laborin' under that delusion. And I move he be not\nasked for it. We've got quite as much as we need, without it. I put my\nmotion.”\n\n“That is, YOU don't put it,” suggested Winch, correctingly. “You move\nit, and Brother Ware, whom we're all so glad to see able to come and\npreside--he'll put it.”\n\nThere was a moment's silence. “You've heard the motion,” said Theron,\ntentatively, and then paused for possible remarks. He was not going to\nmeddle in this thing himself, and Gorringe was the only other who might\nhave an opinion to offer. The necessities of the situation forced him\nto glance at the lawyer inquiringly. He did so, and turned his eyes away\nagain like a shot. Gorringe was looking him squarely in the face, and\nthe look was freighted with satirical contempt.\n\nThe young minister spoke between clinched teeth. “All those in favor\nwill say aye.”\n\nBrothers Pierce and Winch put up a simultaneous and confident “Aye.”\n\n“No, you don't!” interposed the lawyer, with deliberate, sneering\nemphasis. “I decidedly protest against Winch's voting. He's directly\ninterested, and he mustn't vote. Your chairman knows that perfectly\nwell.”\n\n“Yes, I think Brother Winch ought not to vote,” decided Theron, with\ngreat calmness. He saw now what was coming, and underneath his surface\ncomposure there were sharp flutterings.\n\n“Very well, then,” said Gorringe. “I vote no, and it's a tie. It rests\nwith the chairman now to cast the deciding vote, and say whether this\ninteresting arrangement shall go through or not.”\n\n“Me?” said Theron, eying the lawyer with a cool self-control which had\ncome all at once to him. “Me? Oh, I vote Aye.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\n“Well, I did what you told me to do,” Theron Ware remarked to Sister\nSoulsby, when at last they found themselves alone in the sitting-room\nafter the midday meal.\n\nIt had taken not a little strategic skirmishing to secure the room to\nthemselves for the hospitable Alice, much touched by the thought of her\nnew friend's departure that very evening had gladly proposed to let all\nthe work stand over until night, and devote herself entirely to Sister\nSoulsby. When, finally, Brother Soulsby conceived and deftly executed\nthe coup of interesting her in the budding of roses, and then leading\nher off into the garden to see with her own eyes how it was done, Theron\nhad a sense of being left alone with a conspirator. The notion impelled\nhim to plunge at once into the heart of their mystery.\n\n“I did what you told me to do,” he repeated, looking up from his low\neasy-chair to where she sat by the desk; “and I dare say you won't be\nsurprised when I add that I have no respect for myself for doing it.”\n\n“And yet you would go and do it right over again, eh?” the woman\nsaid, in bright, pert tones, nodding her head, and smiling at him with\nroguish, comprehending eyes. “Yes, that's the way we're built. We spend\nour lives doing that sort of thing.”\n\n“I don't know that you would precisely grasp my meaning,” said the young\nminister, with a polite effort in his words to mask the untoward side of\nthe suggestion. “It is a matter of conscience with me; and I am pained\nand shocked at myself.”\n\nSister Soulsby drummed for an absent moment with her thin, nervous\nfingers on the desk-top. “I guess maybe you'd better go and lie down\nagain,” she said gently. “You're a sick man, still, and it's no good\nyour worrying your head just now with things of this sort. You'll see\nthem differently when you're quite yourself again.”\n\n“No, no,” pleaded Theron. “Do let us have our talk out! I'm all right.\nMy mind is clear as a bell. Truly, I've really counted on this talk with\nyou.”\n\n“But there's something else to talk about, isn't there, besides--besides\nyour conscience?” she asked. Her eyes bent upon him a kindly pressure as\nshe spoke, which took all possible harshness from her meaning.\n\nTheron answered the glance rather than her words. “I know that you are\nmy friend,” he said simply.\n\nSister Soulsby straightened herself, and looked down upon him with a new\nintentness. “Well, then,” she began, “let's thrash this thing out right\nnow, and be done with it. You say it's hurt your conscience to do\njust one little hundredth part of what there was to be done here. Ask\nyourself what you mean by that. Mind, I'm not quarrelling, and I'm not\nthinking about anything except just your own state of mind. You think\nyou soiled your hands by doing what you did. That is to say, you wanted\nALL the dirty work done by other people. That's it, isn't it?”\n\n“The Rev. Mr. Ware sat up, in turn, and looked doubtingly into his\ncompanion's face.\n\n“Oh, we were going to be frank, you know,” she added, with a pleasant\nplay of mingled mirth and honest liking in her eyes.\n\n“No,” he said, picking his words, “my point would rather be that--that\nthere ought not to have been any of what you yourself call this--this\n'dirty work.' THAT is my feeling.”\n\n“Now we're getting at it,” said Sister Soulsby, briskly. “My dear\nfriend, you might just as well say that potatoes are unclean and unfit\nto eat because manure is put into the ground they grow in. Just look at\nthe case. Your church here was running behind every year. Your people\nhad got into a habit of putting in nickels instead of dimes, and letting\nyou sweat for the difference. That's a habit, like tobacco, or biting\nyour fingernails, or anything else. Either you were all to come to smash\nhere, or the people had to be shaken up, stood on their heads, broken\nof their habit. It's my business--mine and Soulsby's--to do that sort\nof thing. We came here and we did it--did it up brown, too. We not\nonly raised all the money the church needs, and to spare, but I took a\npersonal shine to you, and went out of my way to fix up things for\nyou. It isn't only the extra hundred dollars, but the whole tone of\nthe congregation is changed toward you now. You'll see that they'll be\nasking to have you back here, next spring. And you're solid with your\nPresiding Elder, too. Well, now, tell me straight--is that worth while,\nor not?”\n\n“I've told you that I am very grateful,” answered the minister, “and I\nsay it again, and I shall never be tired of repeating it. But--but it\nwas the means I had in mind.”\n\n“Quite so,” rejoined the sister, patiently. “If you saw the way a hotel\ndinner was cooked, you wouldn't be able to stomach it. Did you ever see\na play? In a theatre, I mean. I supposed not. But you'll understand when\nI say that the performance looks one way from where the audience sit,\nand quite a different way when you are behind the scenes. THERE you see\nthat the trees and houses are cloth, and the moon is tissue paper,\nand the flying fairy is a middle-aged woman strung up on a rope.\nThat doesn't prove that the play, out in front, isn't beautiful and\naffecting, and all that. It only shows that everything in this world is\nproduced by machinery--by organization. The trouble is that you've\nbeen let in on the stage, behind the scenes, so to speak, and you're so\ngreen--if you'll pardon me--that you want to sit down and cry because\nthe trees ARE cloth, and the moon IS a lantern. And I say, don't be such\na goose!”\n\n“I see what you mean,” Theron said, with an answering smile. He added,\nmore gravely, “All the same, the Winch business seems to me--”\n\n“Now the Winch business is my own affair,” Sister Soulsby broke in\nabruptly. “I take all the responsibility for that. You need know nothing\nabout it. You simply voted as you did on the merits of the case as he\npresented them--that's all.”\n\n“But--” Theron began, and then paused. Something had occurred to him,\nand he knitted his brows to follow its course of expansion in his mind.\nSuddenly he raised his head. “Then you arranged with Winch to make those\nbogus offers--just to lead others on?” he demanded.\n\nSister Soulsby's large eyes beamed down upon him in reply, at first in\nopen merriment, then more soberly, till their regard was almost pensive.\n\n“Let us talk of something else,” she said. “All that is past and gone.\nIt has nothing to do with you, anyway. I've got some advice to give you\nabout keeping up this grip you've got on your people.”\n\nThe young minister had risen to his feet while she spoke. He put his\nhands in his pockets, and with rounded shoulders began slowly pacing the\nroom. After a turn or two he came to the desk, and leaned against it.\n\n“I doubt if it's worth while going into that,” he said, in the solemn\ntone of one who feels that an irrevocable thing is being uttered. She\nwaited to hear more, apparently. “I think I shall go away--give up the\nministry,” he added.\n\nSister Soulsby's eyes revealed no such shock of consternation as he,\nunconsciously, had looked for. They remained quite calm; and when she\nspoke, they deepened, to fit her speech, with what he read to be a\ngaze of affectionate melancholy--one might say pity. She shook her head\nslowly.\n\n“No--don't let any one else hear you say that,” she replied. “My poor\nyoung friend, it's no good to even think it. The real wisdom is to\nschool yourself to move along smoothly, and not fret, and get the best\nof what's going. I've known others who felt as you do--of course there\nare times when every young man of brains and high notions feels that\nway--but there's no help for it. Those who tried to get out only broke\nthemselves. Those who stayed in, and made the best of it--well, one of\nthem will be a bishop in another ten years.”\n\nTheron had started walking again. “But the moral degradation of it!”\n he snapped out at her over his shoulder. “I'd rather earn the meanest\nliving, at an honest trade, and be free from it.”\n\n“That may all be,” responded Sister Soulsby. “But it isn't a question of\nwhat you'd rather do. It's what you can do. How could you earn a living?\nWhat trade or business do you suppose you could take up now, and get a\nliving out of? Not one, my man, not one.”\n\nTheron stopped and stared at her. This view of his capabilities came\nupon him with the force and effect of a blow.\n\n“I don't discover, myself,” he began stumblingly, “that I'm so\nconspicuously inferior to the men I see about me who do make livings,\nand very good ones, too.”\n\n“Of course you're not,” she replied with easy promptness; “you're\ngreatly the other way, or I shouldn't be taking this trouble with you.\nBut you're what you are because you're where you are. The moment you try\non being somewhere else, you're done for. In all this world nobody else\ncomes to such unmerciful and universal grief as the unfrocked priest.”\n\nThe phrase sent Theron's fancy roving. “I know a Catholic priest,” he\nsaid irrelevantly, “who doesn't believe an atom in--in things.”\n\n“Very likely,” said Sister Soulsby. “Most of us do. But you don't hear\nhim talking about going and earning his living, I'll bet! Or if he\ndoes, he takes powerful good care not to go, all the same. They've got\nhorse-sense, those priests. They're artists, too. They know how to allow\nfor the machinery behind the scenes.”\n\n“But it's all so different,” urged the young minister; “the same things\nare not expected of them. Now I sat the other night and watched those\npeople you got up around the altar-rail, groaning and shouting and\ncrying, and the others jumping up and down with excitement, and Sister\nLovejoy--did you see her?--coming out of her pew and regularly waltzing\nin the aisle, with her eyes shut, like a whirling dervish--I positively\nbelieve it was all that made me ill. I couldn't stand it. I can't stand\nit now. I won't go back to it! Nothing shall make me!”\n\n“Oh-h, yes, you will,” she rejoined soothingly. “There's nothing else to\ndo. Just put a good face on it, and make up your mind to get through by\ntreading on as few corns as possible, and keeping your own toes well in,\nand you'll be surprised how easy it'll all come to be. You were\nspeaking of the revival business. Now that exemplifies just what I was\nsaying--it's a part of our machinery. Now a church is like everything\nelse,--it's got to have a boss, a head, an authority of some sort, that\npeople will listen to and mind. The Catholics are different, as you say.\nTheir church is chuck-full of authority--all the way from the Pope\ndown to the priest--and accordingly they do as they're told. But the\nProtestants--your Methodists most of all--they say 'No, we won't have\nany authority, we won't obey any boss.' Very well, what happens? We\nwho are responsible for running the thing, and raising the money and\nso on--we have to put on a spurt every once in a while, and work up a\ngeneral state of excitement; and while it's going, don't you see that\nTHAT is the authority, the motive power, whatever you like to call it,\nby which things are done? Other denominations don't need it. We do, and\nthat's why we've got it.”\n\n“But the mean dishonesty of it all!” Theron broke forth. He moved about\nagain, his bowed face drawn as with bodily suffering. “The low-born\ntricks, the hypocrisies! I feel as if I could never so much as look at\nthese people here again without disgust.”\n\n“Oh, now that's where you make your mistake,” Sister Soulsby put in\nplacidly. “These people of yours are not a whit worse than other people.\nThey've got their good streaks and their bad streaks, just like the rest\nof us. Take them by and large, they're quite on a par with other folks\nthe whole country through.”\n\n“I don't believe there's another congregation in the Conference\nwhere--where this sort of thing would have been needed, or, I might say,\ntolerated,” insisted Theron.\n\n“Perhaps you're right,” the other assented; “but that only shows that\nyour people here are different from the others--not that they're worse.\nYou don't seem to realize: Octavius, so far as the Methodists are\nconcerned, is twenty or thirty years behind the times. Now that has its\nadvantages and its disadvantages. The church here is tough and coarse,\nand full of grit, like a grindstone; and it does ministers from other\nmore niminy-piminy places all sorts of good to come here once in a while\nand rub themselves up against it. It scours the rust and mildew off from\ntheir piety, and they go back singing and shouting. But of course\nit's had a different effect with you. You're razor-steel instead of\nscythe-steel, and the grinding's been too rough and violent for you.\nBut you see what I mean. These people here really take their primitive\nMethodism seriously. To them the profession of entire sanctification is\ntruly a genuine thing. Well, don't you see, when people just know that\nthey're saved, it doesn't seem to them to matter so much what they\ndo. They feel that ordinary rules may well be bent and twisted in the\ninterest of people so supernaturally good as they are. That's pure human\nnature. It's always been like that.”\n\nTheron paused in his walk to look absently at her. “That thought,”\n he said, in a vague, slow way, “seems to be springing up in my path,\nwhichever way I turn. It oppresses me, and yet it fascinates me--this\nidea that the dead men have known more than we know, done more than we\ndo; that there is nothing new anywhere; that--”\n\n“Never mind the dead men,” interposed Sister Soulsby. “Just you come\nand sit down here. I hate to have you straddling about the room when I'm\ntrying to talk to you.”\n\nTheron obeyed, and as he sank into the low seat, Sister Soulsby drew up\nher chair, and put her hand on his shoulder. Her gaze rested upon his\nwith impressive steadiness.\n\n“And now I want to talk seriously to you, as a friend,” she began. “You\nmustn't breathe to any living soul the shadow of a hint of this nonsense\nabout leaving the ministry. I could see how you were feeling--I saw the\nbook you were reading the first time I entered this room--and that made\nme like you; only I expected to find you mixing up more worldly gumption\nwith your Renan. Well, perhaps I like you all the better for not having\nit--for being so delightfully fresh. At any rate, that made me sail in\nand straighten your affairs for you. And now, for God's sake, keep them\nstraight. Just put all notions of anything else out of your head. Watch\nyour chief men and women, and be friends with them. Keep your eye open\nfor what they think you ought to do, and do it. Have your own ideas as\nmuch as you like, read what you like, say 'Damn' under your breath as\nmuch as you like, but don't let go of your job. I've knocked about\ntoo much, and I've seen too many promising young fellows cut their own\nthroats for pure moonshine, not to have a right to say that.”\n\nTheron could not be insensible to the friendly hand on his shoulder, or\nto the strenuous sincerity of the voice which thus adjured him.\n\n“Well,” he said vaguely, smiling up into her earnest eyes, “if we agree\nthat it IS moonshine.”\n\n“See here!” she exclaimed, with renewed animation, patting his shoulder\nin a brisk, automatic way, to point the beginnings of her confidences:\n“I'll tell you something. It's about myself. I've got a religion of my\nown, and it's got just one plank in it, and that is that the time to\nseparate the sheep from the goats is on Judgment Day, and that it can't\nbe done a minute before.”\n\nThe young minister took in the thought, and turned it about in his mind,\nand smiled upon it.\n\n“And that brings me to what I'm going to tell you,” Sister Soulsby\ncontinued. She leaned back in her chair, and crossed her knees so\nthat one well-shaped and artistically shod foot poised itself close to\nTheron's hand. Her eyes dwelt upon his face with an engaging candor.\n\n“I began life,” she said, “as a girl by running away from a stupid home\nwith a man that I knew was married already. After that, I supported\nmyself for a good many years--generally, at first, on the stage. I've\nbeen a front-ranker in Amazon ballets, and I've been leading lady in\ncomic opera companies out West. I've told fortunes in one room of a\nmining-camp hotel where the biggest game of faro in the Territory went\non in another. I've been a professional clairvoyant, and I've been a\nprofessional medium, and I've been within one vote of being indicted\nby a grand jury, and the money that bought that vote was put up by the\nsmartest and most famous train-gambler between Omaha and 'Frisco, a\ngentleman who died in his boots and took three sheriff's deputies along\nwith him to Kingdom-Come. Now, that's MY record.”\n\nTheron looked earnestly at her, and said nothing.\n\n“And now take Soulsby,” she went on. “Of course I take it for granted\nthere's a good deal that he has never felt called upon to mention. He\nhasn't what you may call a talkative temperament. But there is also a\ngood deal that I do know. He's been an actor, too, and to this day I'd\nback him against Edwin Booth himself to recite 'Clarence's Dream.' And\nhe's been a medium, and then he was a travelling phrenologist, and for\na long time he was advance agent for a British Blondes show, and when I\nfirst saw him he was lecturing on female diseases--and he had HIS little\nturn with a grand jury too. In fact, he was what you may call a regular\nbad old rooster.”\n\nAgain Theron suffered the pause to lapse without comment--save for an\namorphous sort of conversation which he felt to be going on between his\neyes and those of Sister Soulsby.\n\n“Well, then,” she resumed, “so much for us apart. Now about us together.\nWe liked each other from the start. We compared notes, and we found that\nwe had both soured on living by fakes, and that we were tired of the\nroad, and wanted to settle down and be respectable in our old age. We\nhad a little money--enough to see us through a year or two. Soulsby had\nalways hungered and longed to own a garden and raise flowers, and had\nnever been able to stay long enough in one place to see so much as a\nbean-pod ripen. So we took a little place in a quiet country village\ndown on the Southern Tier, and he planted everything three deep all over\nthe place, and I bought a roomful of cheap good books, and we started\nin. We took to it like ducks to water for a while, and I don't say that\nwe couldn't have stood it out, just doing nothing, to this very day; but\nas luck would have it, during the first winter there was a revival at\nthe local Methodist church, and we went every evening--at first just to\nkill time, and then because we found we liked the noise and excitement\nand general racket of the thing. After it was all over each of us found\nthat the other had been mighty near going up to the rail and joining the\nmourners. And another thing had occurred to each of us, too--that is,\nwhat tremendous improvements there were possible in the way that amateur\nrevivalist worked up his business. This stuck in our crops, and we\nfigured on it all through the winter.--Well, to make a long story short,\nwe finally went into the thing ourselves.”\n\n“Tell me one thing,” interposed Theron. “I'm anxious to understand\nit all as we go along. Were you and he at any time sincerely\nconverted?--that is, I mean, genuinely convicted of sin and conscious\nof--you know what I mean!”\n\n“Oh, bless you, yes,” responded Sister Soulsby. “Not only once--dozens\nof times--I may say every time. We couldn't do good work if we weren't.\nBut that's a matter of temperament--of emotions.”\n\n“Precisely. That was what I was getting at,” explained Theron.\n\n“Well, then, hear what I was getting at,” she went on. “You were talking\nvery loudly here about frauds and hypocrisies and so on, a few minutes\nago. Now I say that Soulsby and I do good, and that we're good fellows.\nNow take him, for example. There isn't a better citizen in all\nChemung County than he is, or a kindlier neighbor, or a better or more\ncharitable man. I've known him to stay up a whole winter's night in\na poor Irishman's stinking and freezing stable, trying to save his\ncart-horse for him, that had been seized with some sort of fit. The\nman's whole livelihood, and his family's, was in that horse; and when it\ndied, Soulsby bought him another, and never told even ME about it. Now\nthat I call real piety, if you like.”\n\n“So do I,” put in Theron, cordially.\n\n“And this question of fraud,” pursued his companion,--“look at it in\nthis light. You heard us sing. Well, now, I was a singer, of course, but\nSoulsby hardly knew one note from another. I taught him to sing, and he\nwent at it patiently and diligently, like a little man. And I invented\nthat scheme of finding tunes which the crowd didn't know, and so\ncouldn't break in on and smother. I simply took Chopin--he is full of\nsixths, you know--and I got all sorts of melodies out of his waltzes\nand mazurkas and nocturnes and so on, and I trained Soulsby just to sing\nthose sixths so as to make the harmony, and there you are. He couldn't\nsing by himself any more than a crow, but he's got those sixths of his\ndown to a hair. Now that's machinery, management, organization. We take\nthese tunes, written by a devil-may-care Pole who was living with George\nSand openly at the time, and pass 'em off on the brethren for hymns.\nIt's a fraud, yes; but it's a good fraud. So they are all good frauds.\nI say frankly that I'm glad that the change and the chance came to help\nSoulsby and me to be good frauds.”\n\n“And the point is that I'm to be a good fraud, too,” commented the young\nminister.\n\nShe had risen, and he got to his feet as well. He instinctively sought\nfor her hand, and pressed it warmly, and held it in both his, with an\nexuberance of gratitude and liking in his manner.\n\nSister Soulsby danced her eyes at him with a saucy little shake of the\nhead. “I'm afraid you'll never make a really GOOD fraud,” she said. “You\nhaven't got it in you. Your intentions are all right, but your execution\nis hopelessly clumsy. I came up to your bedroom there twice while you\nwere sick, just to say 'howdy,' and you kept your eyes shut, and all the\nwhile a blind horse could have told that you were wide awake.”\n\n“I must have thought it was my wife,” said Theron.\n\n\n\n\nPART III\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nWhen the lingering dusk finally settled down upon this long summer\nevening, the train bearing the Soulsbys homeward was already some score\nof miles on its way, and the Methodists of Octavius had nearly finished\ntheir weekly prayer-meeting.\n\nAfter the stirring events of the revival, it was only to be expected\nthat this routine, home-made affair should suffer from a reaction. The\nattendance was larger than usual, perhaps, but the proceedings were\nspiritless and tame. Neither the pastor nor his wife was present at\nthe beginning, and the class-leader upon whom control devolved made but\nfeeble headway against the spell of inertia which the hot night-air\nlaid upon the gathering. Long pauses intervened between the perfunctory\npraise-offerings and supplications, and the hymns weariedly raised from\ntime to time fell again in languor by the wayside.\n\nAlice came in just as people were beginning to hope that some one\nwould start the Doxology, and bring matters to a close. Her appearance\napparently suggested this to the class-leader, for in a few moments the\nmeeting had been dismissed, and some of the members, on their way out,\nwere shaking hands with their minister's wife, and expressing the polite\nhope that he was better. The worried look in her face, and the obvious\nstains of recent tears upon her cheeks imparted an added point and\nfervor to these inquiries, but she replied to all in tones of\nstudied tranquillity that, although not feeling well enough to attend\nprayer-meeting, Brother Ware was steadily recovering strength, and\nconfidently expected to be in complete health by Sunday. They left her,\nand could hardly wait to get into the vestibule to ask one another in\nwhispers what on earth she could have been crying about.\n\nMeanwhile Brother Ware improved his convalescent state by pacing slowly\nup and down under the elms on the side of the street opposite the\nCatholic church. There were no houses here for a block and more; the\nsidewalk was broken in many places, so that passers-by avoided it; the\noverhanging boughs shrouded it all in obscurity; it was preeminently a\nplace to be alone in.\n\nTheron had driven to the depot with his guests an hour before, and after\na period of pleasant waiting on the platform, had said good-bye to\nthem as the train moved away. Then he turned to Alice, who had also\naccompanied them in the carriage, and was conscious of a certain\nannoyance at her having come. That long familiar talk of the afternoon\nhad given him the feeling that he was entitled to bid farewell to Sister\nSoulsby--to both the Soulsbys--by himself.\n\n“I am afraid folks will think it strange--neither of us attending the\nprayer-meeting,” he said, with a suggestion of reproof in his tone, as\nthey left the station-yard.\n\n“If we get back in time, I'll run in for a minute,” answered Alice, with\ndocility.\n\n“No--no,” he broke in. “I'm not equal to walking so fast. You run on\nahead, and explain matters, and I will come along slowly.”\n\n“The hack we came in is still there in the yard,” the wife suggested.\n“We could drive home in that. I don't believe it would cost more than a\nquarter--and if you're feeling badly--”\n\n“But I am NOT feeling badly,” Theron replied, with frank impatience.\n“Only I feel--I feel that being alone with my thoughts would be good for\nme.”\n\n“Oh, certainly--by all means!” Alice had said, and turned sharply on her\nheel.\n\nBeing alone with these thoughts, Theron strolled aimlessly about, and\ndid not think at all. The shadows gathered, and fireflies began to\ndisclose their tiny gleams among the shrubbery in the gardens.\nA lamp-lighter came along, and passed him, leaving in his wake a\nstraggling double line of lights, glowing radiantly against the\nblack-green of the trees. This recalled to Theron that he had heard that\nthe town council lit the street lamps by the almanac, and economized gas\nwhen moonshine was due. The idea struck him as droll, and he dwelt\nupon it in various aspects, smiling at some of its comic possibilities.\nLooking up in the middle of one of these whimsical conceits, the\nsportive impulse died suddenly within him. He realized that it was dark,\nand that the massive black bulk reared against the sky on the other side\nof the road was the Catholic church. The other fact, that he had been\nthere walking to and fro for some time, was borne in upon him more\nslowly. He turned, and resumed the pacing up and down with a still more\nleisurely step, musing upon the curious way in which people's minds all\nunconsciously follow about where instincts and intuitions lead.\n\nNo doubt it was what Sister Soulsby had said about Catholics which had\ninsensibly guided his purposeless stroll in this direction. What a\nwoman that was! Somehow the purport of her talk--striking, and even\nastonishing as he had found it--did not stand out so clearly in his\nmemory as did the image of the woman herself. She must have\nbeen extremely pretty once. For that matter she still was a most\nattractive-looking woman. It had been a genuine pleasure to have her in\nthe house--to see her intelligent responsive face at the table--to have\nit in one's power to make drafts at will upon the fund of sympathy and\nappreciation, of facile mirth and ready tenderness in those big eyes of\nhers. He liked that phrase she had used about herself--“a good fellow.”\n It seemed to fit her to a “t.” And Soulsby was a good fellow too. All at\nonce it occurred to him to wonder whether they were married or not.\n\nBut really that was no affair of his, he reflected. A citizen of the\nintellectual world should be above soiling his thoughts with mean\ncuriosities of that sort, and he drove the impertinent query down again\nunder the surface of his mind. He refused to tolerate, as well, sundry\nvagrant imaginings which rose to cluster about and literalize the\nromance of her youth which Sister Soulsby had so frankly outlined.\nHe would think upon nothing but her as he knew her,--the kindly,\nquick-witted, capable and charming woman who had made such a brilliant\nbreak in the monotony of life at that dull parsonage of his. The\nonly genuine happiness in life must consist in having bright, smart,\nattractive women like that always about.\n\nThe lights were visible now in the upper rooms of Father Forbes'\npastorate across the way. Theron paused for a second to consider whether\nhe wanted to go over and call on the priest. He decided that mentally he\nwas too fagged and flat for such an undertaking. He needed another sort\nof companionship--some restful, soothing human contact, which should\nexact nothing from him in return, but just take charge of him,\nwith soft, wise words and pleasant plays of fancy, and jokes\nand--and--something of the general effect created by Sister Soulsby's\neyes. The thought expanded itself, and he saw that he had never realized\nbefore--nay, never dreamt before--what a mighty part the comradeship of\ntalented, sweet-natured and beautiful women must play in the development\nof genius, the achievement of lofty aims, out in the great world of\ngreat men. To know such women--ah, that would never fall to his hapless\nlot.\n\nThe priest's lamps blinked at him through the trees. He remembered that\npriests were supposed to be even further removed from the possibilities\nof such contact than he was himself. His memory reverted to that\nhorribly ugly old woman whom Father Forbes had spoken of as his\nhousekeeper. Life under the same roof with such a hag must be even worse\nthan--worse than--\n\nThe young minister did not finish the comparison, even in the privacy\nof his inner soul. He stood instead staring over at the pastorate, in a\nkind of stupor of arrested thought. The figure of a woman passed in view\nat the nearest window--a tall figure with pale summer clothes of some\nsort, and a broad summer hat--a flitting effect of diaphanous shadow\nbetween him and the light which streamed from the casement.\n\nTheron felt a little shiver run over him, as if the delicate coolness of\nthe changing night-air had got into his blood. The window was open, and\nhis strained hearing thought it caught the sound of faint laughter. He\ncontinued to gaze at the place where the vision had appeared, the while\na novel and strange perception unfolded itself upon his mind.\n\nHe had come there in the hope of encountering Celia Madden.\n\nNow that he looked this fact in the face, there was nothing remarkable\nabout it. In truth, it was simplicity itself. He was still a sick man,\nweak in body and dejected in spirits. The thought of how unhappy and\nunstrung he was came to him now with an insistent pathos that brought\ntears to his eyes. He was only obeying the universal law of nature--the\nlaw which prompts the pallid spindling sprout of the potato in the\ncellar to strive feebly toward the light.\n\nFrom where he stood in the darkness he stretched out his hands in the\ndirection of that open window. The gesture was his confession to the\noverhanging boughs, to the soft night-breeze, to the stars above--and\nit bore back to him something of the confessional's vague and wistful\nsolace. He seemed already to have drawn down into his soul a taste\nof the refreshment it craved. He sighed deeply, and the hot moisture\nsmarted again upon his eyelids, but this time not all in grief. With\nhis tender compassion for himself there mingled now a flutter of buoyant\nprescience, of exquisite expectancy.\n\nFate walked abroad this summer night. The street door of the pastorate\nopened, and in the flood of illumination which spread suddenly forth\nover the steps and sidewalk, Theron saw again the tall form, with the\nindefinitely light-hued flowing garments and the wide straw hat. He\nheard a tuneful woman's voice call out “Good-night, Maggie,” and caught\nno response save the abrupt closing of the door, which turned everything\nblack again with a bang. He listened acutely for another instant, and\nthen with long, noiseless strides made his way down his deserted side of\nthe street. He moderated his pace as he turned to cross the road at the\ncorner, and then, still masked by the trees, halted altogether, in a\nmomentary tumult of apprehension. No--yes--it was all right. The girl\nsauntered out from the total darkness into the dim starlight of the open\ncorner.\n\n“Why, bless me, is that you, Miss Madden?”\n\nCelia seemed to discern readily enough, through the accents of surprise,\nthe identity of the tall, slim man who addressed her from the shadows.\n\n“Good-evening, Mr. Ware,” she said, with prompt affability. “I'm so glad\nto find you out again. We heard you were ill.”\n\n“I have been very ill,” responded Theron, as they shook hands and walked\non together. He added, with a quaver in his voice, “I am still far\nfrom strong. I really ought not to be out at all. But--but the longing\nfor--for--well, I COULDN'T stay in any longer. Even if it kills me, I\nshall be glad I came out tonight.”\n\n“Oh, we won't talk of killing,” said Celia. “I don't believe in\nillnesses myself.”\n\n“But you believe in collapses of the nerves,” put in Theron, with gentle\nsadness, “in moral and spiritual and mental breakdowns. I remember how I\nwas touched by the way you told me YOU suffered from them. I had to take\nwhat you said then for granted. I had had no experience of it myself.\nBut now I know what it is.” He drew a long, pathetic sigh. “Oh, DON'T I\nknow what it is!” he repeated gloomily.\n\n“Come, my friend, cheer up,” Celia purred at him, in soothing tones. He\nfelt that there was a deliciously feminine and sisterly intuition in\nher speech, and in the helpful, nurse-like way in which she drew his arm\nthrough hers. He leaned upon this support, and was glad of it in every\nfibre of his being.\n\n“Do you remember? You promised--that last time I saw you--to play for\nme,” he reminded her. They were passing the little covered postern door\nat the side and rear of the church as he spoke, and he made a half halt\nto point the coincidence.\n\n“Oh, there's no one to blow the organ,” she said, divining his\nsuggestion. “And I haven't the key--and, besides, the organ is too heavy\nand severe for an invalid. It would overwhelm you tonight.”\n\n“Not as you would know how to play it for me,” urged Theron, pensively.\n“I feel as if good music to-night would make me well again. I am really\nvery ill and weak--and unhappy!”\n\nThe girl seemed moved by the despairing note in his voice. She invited\nhim by a sympathetic gesture to lean even more directly on her arm.\n\n“Come home with me, and I'll play Chopin to you,” she said, in\ncompassionate friendliness. “He is the real medicine for bruised and\nwounded nerves. You shall have as much of him as you like.”\n\nThe idea thus unexpectedly thrown forth spread itself like some vast and\ninexpressibly alluring vista before Theron's imagination. The spice of\nadventure in it fascinated his mind as well, but for a shrinking moment\nthe flesh was weak.\n\n“I'm afraid your people would--would think it strange,” he faltered--and\nbegan also to recall that he had some people of his own who would be\neven more amazed.\n\n“Nonsense,” said Celia, in fine, bold confidence, and with a reassuring\npressure on his arm. “I allow none of my people to question what I do.\nThey never dream of such a preposterous thing. Besides, you will see\nnone of them. Mrs. Madden is at the seaside, and my father and brother\nhave their own part of the house. I shan't listen for a minute to your\nnot coming. Come, I'm your doctor. I'm to make you well again.”\n\nThere was further conversation, and Theron more or less knew that he was\nbearing a part in it, but his whole mind seemed concentrated, in a\nsort of delicious terror, upon the wonderful experience to which every\nfootstep brought him nearer. His magnetized fancy pictured a great\nspacious parlor, such as a mansion like the Maddens' would of course\ncontain, and there would be a grand piano, and lace curtains, and\npaintings in gold frames, and a chandelier, and velvet easy-chairs, and\nhe would sit in one of these, surrounded by all the luxury of the rich,\nwhile Celia played to him. There would be servants about, he presumed,\nand very likely they would recognize him, and of course they would\ntalk about it to Tom, Dick and Harry afterward. But he said to himself\ndefiantly that he didn't care.\n\nHe withdrew his arm from hers as they came upon the well-lighted main\nstreet. He passed no one who seemed to know him. Presently they came\nto the Madden place, and Celia, without waiting for the gravelled walk,\nstruck obliquely across the lawn. Theron, who had been lagging behind\nwith a certain circumspection, stepped briskly to her side now. Their\nprogress over the soft, close-cropped turf in the dark together, with\nthe scent of lilies and perfumed shrubs heavy on the night air, and\nthe majestic bulk of the big silent house rising among the trees before\nthem, gave him a thrilling sense of the glory of individual freedom.\n\n“I feel a new man already,” he declared, as they swung along on the\ngrass. He breathed a long sigh of content, and drew nearer, so that\ntheir shoulders touched now and again as they walked. In a minute more\nthey were standing on the doorstep, and Theron heard the significant\njingle of a bunch of keys which his companion was groping for in her\nelusive pocket. He was conscious of trembling a little at the sound.\n\nIt seemed that, unlike other people, the Maddens did not have their\nparlor on the ground-floor, opening off the front hall. Theron stood in\nthe complete darkness of this hall, till Celia had lit one of several\ncandles which were in their hand-sticks on a sort of sideboard next the\nhat-rack. She beckoned him with a gesture of her head, and he followed\nher up a broad staircase, magnificent in its structural appointments\nof inlaid woods, and carpeted with what to his feet felt like down. The\ntiny light which his guide bore before her half revealed, as they passed\nin their ascent, tall lengths of tapestry, and the dull glint of\narmor and brazen discs in shadowed niches on the nearer wall. Over the\nstair-rail lay an open space of such stately dimensions, bounded by\nterminal lines of decoration so distant in the faint candle-flicker,\nthat the young country minister could think of no word but “palatial” to\nfit it all.\n\nAt the head of the flight, Celia led the way along a wide corridor to\nwhere it ended. Here, stretched from side to side, and suspended from\nbroad hoops of a copper-like metal, was a thick curtain, of a uniform\ncolor which Theron at first thought was green, and then decided must be\nblue. She pushed its heavy folds aside, and unlocked another door. He\npassed under the curtain behind her, and closed the door.\n\nThe room into which he had made his way was not at all after the fashion\nof any parlor he had ever seen. In the obscure light it was difficult\nto tell what it resembled. He made out what he took to be a painter's\neasel, standing forth independently in the centre of things. There were\nrows of books on rude, low shelves. Against one of the two windows was\na big, flat writing-table--or was it a drawing-table?--littered with\npapers. Under the other window was a carpenter's bench, with a large\nmound of something at one end covered with a white cloth. On a table\nbehind the easel rose a tall mechanical contrivance, the chief feature\nof which was a thick upright spiral screw. The floor was of bare\nwood stained brown. The walls of this queer room had photographs and\npictures, taken apparently from illustrated papers, pinned up at random\nfor their only ornament.\n\nCelia had lighted three or four other candles on the mantel. She\ncaught the dumfounded expression with which her guest was surveying his\nsurroundings, and gave a merry little laugh.\n\n“This is my workshop,” she explained. “I keep this for the things I do\nbadly--things I fool with. If I want to paint, or model in clay, or bind\nbooks, or write, or draw, or turn on the lathe, or do some carpentering,\nhere's where I do it. All the things that make a mess which has to\nbe cleaned up--they are kept out here--because this is as far as the\nservants are allowed to come.”\n\nShe unlocked still another door as she spoke--a door which was also\nconcealed behind a curtain.\n\n“Now,” she said, holding up the candle so that its reddish flare rounded\nwith warmth the creamy fulness of her chin and throat, and glowed upon\nher hair in a flame of orange light--“now I will show you what is my\nvery own.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nTheron Ware looked about him with frankly undisguised astonishment.\n\nThe room in which he found himself was so dark at first that it\nyielded little to the eye, and that little seemed altogether beyond his\ncomprehension. His gaze helplessly followed Celia and her candle\nabout as she busied herself in the work of illumination. When she had\nfinished, and pinched out the taper, there were seven lights in the\napartment--lights beaming softly through half-opaque alternating\nrectangles of blue and yellow glass. They must be set in some sort of\nlanterns around against the wall, he thought, but the shape of these he\ncould hardly make out.\n\nGradually his sight adapted itself to this subdued light, and he began\nto see other things. These queer lamps were placed, apparently, so as to\nshed a special radiance upon some statues which stood in the corners of\nthe chamber, and upon some pictures which were embedded in the walls.\nTheron noted that the statues, the marble of which lost its aggressive\nwhiteness under the tinted lights, were mostly of naked men and women;\nthe pictures, four or five in number, were all variations of a single\ntheme--the Virgin Mary and the Child.\n\nA less untutored vision than his would have caught more swiftly the\nscheme of color and line in which these works of art bore their share.\nThe walls of the room were in part of flat upright wooden columns,\nterminating high above in simple capitals, and they were all painted in\npale amber and straw and primrose hues, irregularly wavering here and\nthere toward suggestions of white. Between these pilasters were broader\npanels of stamped leather, in gently varying shades of peacock blue.\nThese contrasted colors vaguely interwove and mingled in what he\ncould see of the shadowed ceiling far above. They were repeated in the\ndraperies and huge cushions and pillows of the low, wide divan which ran\nabout three sides of the room. Even the floor, where it revealed itself\namong the scattered rugs, was laid in a mosaic pattern of matched woods,\nwhich, like the rugs, gave back these same shifting blues and uncertain\nyellows.\n\nThe fourth side of the apartment was broken in outline at one end by the\ndoor through which they had entered, and at the other by a broad, square\nopening, hung with looped-back curtains of a thin silken stuff. Between\nthe two apertures rose against the wall what Theron took at first glance\nto be an altar. There were pyramidal rows of tall candles here on either\nside, each masked with a little silken hood; below, in the centre, a\nshelf-like projection supported what seemed a massive, carved casket,\nand in the beautiful intricacies of this, and the receding canopy of\ndelicate ornamentation which depended above it, the dominant color was\nwhite, deepening away in its shadows, by tenderly minute gradations, to\nthe tints which ruled the rest of the room.\n\nCelia lighted some of the high, thick tapers in these candelabra, and\nopened the top of the casket. Theron saw with surprise that she had\nuncovered the keyboard of a piano. He viewed with much greater amazement\nher next proceeding--which was to put a cigarette between her lips, and,\nbending over one of the candles with it for an instant, turn to him with\na filmy, opalescent veil of smoke above her head.\n\n“Make yourself comfortable anywhere,” she said, with a gesture which\ncomprehended all the divans and pillows in the place. “Will you smoke?”\n\n“I have never tried since I was a little boy,” said Theron, “but I think\nI could. If you don't mind, I should like to see.”\n\nLounging at his ease on the oriental couch, Theron experimented\ncautiously upon the unaccustomed tobacco, and looked at Celia with what\nhe felt to be the confident quiet of a man of the world. She had thrown\naside her hat, and in doing so had half released some of the heavy\nstrands of hair coiled at the back of her head. His glance instinctively\nrested upon this wonderful hair of hers. There was no mistaking the\nsudden fascination its disorder had for his eye.\n\nShe stood before him with the cigarette poised daintily between thumb\nand finger of a shapely hand, and smiled comprehendingly down on her\nguest.\n\n“I suffered the horrors of the damned with this hair of mine when I was\na child,” she said. “I daresay all children have a taste for persecuting\nred-heads; but it's a specialty with Irish children. They get hold\nsomehow of an ancient national superstition, or legend, that red hair\nwas brought into Ireland by the Danes. It's been a term of reproach with\nus since Brian Boru's time to call a child a Dane. I used to be pursued\nand baited with it every day of my life, until the one dream of my\nambition was to get old enough to be a Sister of Charity, so that I\nmight hide my hair under one of their big beastly white linen caps. I've\ngot rather away from that ideal since, I'm afraid,” she added, with a\ndroll downward curl of her lip.\n\n“Your hair is very beautiful,” said Theron, in the calm tone of a\nconnoisseur.\n\n“I like it myself,” Celia admitted, and blew a little smoke-ring toward\nhim. “I've made this whole room to match it. The colors, I mean,” she\nexplained, in deference to his uplifted brows. “Between us, we make up\nwhat Whistler would call a symphony. That reminds me--I was going to\nplay for you. Let me finish the cigarette first.”\n\nTheron felt grateful for her reticence about the fact that he had laid\nhis own aside. “I have never seen a room at all like this,” he remarked.\n“You are right; it does fit you perfectly.”\n\nShe nodded her sense of his appreciation. “It is what I like,” she\nsaid. “It expresses ME. I will not have anything about me--or anybody\neither--that I don't like. I suppose if an old Greek could see it, it\nwould make him sick, but it represents what I mean by being a Greek. It\nis as near as an Irishman can get to it.”\n\n“I remember your puzzling me by saying that you were a Greek.”\n\nCelia laughed, and tossed the cigarette-end away. “I'd puzzle you more,\nI'm afraid, if I tried to explain to you what I really meant by it. I\ndivide people up into two classes, you know--Greeks and Jews. Once you\nget hold of that principle, all other divisions and classifications,\nsuch as by race or language or nationality, seem pure foolishness. It\nis the only true division there is. It is just as true among negroes\nor wild Indians who never heard of Greece or Jerusalem, as it is among\nwhite folks. That is the beauty of it. It works everywhere, always.”\n\n“Try it on me,” urged Theron, with a twinkling eye. “Which am I?”\n\n“Both,” said the girl, with a merry nod of the head. “But now I'll play.\nI told you you were to hear Chopin. I prescribe him for you. He is the\nGreekiest of the Greeks. THERE was a nation where all the people were\nartists, where everybody was an intellectual aristocrat, where the\nPhilistine was as unknown, as extinct, as the dodo. Chopin might have\nwritten his music for them.”\n\n“I am interested in Shopang,” put in Theron, suddenly recalling\nSister Soulsby's confidences as to the source of her tunes. “He lived\nwith--what's his name--George something. We were speaking about him only\nthis afternoon.”\n\nCelia looked down into her visitor's face at first inquiringly, then\nwith a latent grin about her lips. “Yes--George something,” she said, in\na tone which mystified him.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Ware was sitting up, a minute afterward, in a ferment of\nawakened consciousness that he had never heard the piano played before.\nAfter a little, he noiselessly rearranged the cushions, and settled\nhimself again in a recumbent posture. It was beyond his strength to\nfollow that first impulse, and keep his mind abreast with what his ears\ntook in. He sighed and lay back, and surrendered his senses to the mere\nunthinking charm of it all.\n\nIt was the Fourth Prelude that was singing in the air about him--a\nsimple, plaintive strain wandering at will over a surface of steady\nrhythmic movement underneath, always creeping upward through mysteries\nof sweetness, always sinking again in cadences of semi-tones. With only\na moment's pause, there came the Seventh Waltz--a rich, bold confusion\nwhich yet was not confused. Theron's ears dwelt with eager delight upon\nthe chasing medley of swift, tinkling sounds, but it left his thoughts\nfree.\n\nFrom where he reclined, he turned his head to scrutinize, one by one,\nthe statues in the corners. No doubt they were beautiful--for this was a\ndepartment in which he was all humility--and one of them, the figure of\na broad-browed, stately, though thick-waisted woman, bending slightly\nforward and with both arms broken off, was decently robed from the hips\ndownward. The others were not robed at all. Theron stared at them with\nthe erratic, rippling jangle of the waltz in his ears, and felt that he\npossessed a new and disturbing conception of what female emancipation\nmeant in these later days. Roving along the wall, his glance rested\nagain upon the largest of the Virgin pictures--a full-length figure\nin sweeping draperies, its radiant, aureoled head upturned in rapt\nadoration, its feet resting on a crescent moon which shone forth in\nbluish silver through festooned clouds of cherubs. The incongruity\nbetween the unashamed statues and this serene incarnation of holy\nwomanhood jarred upon him for the instant. Then his mind went to the\npiano.\n\nWithout a break the waltz had slowed and expanded into a passage of what\nmight be church music, an exquisitely modulated and gently solemn chant,\nthrough which a soft, lingering song roved capriciously, forcing the\nlistener to wonder where it was coming out, even while it caressed and\nsoothed to repose.\n\nHe looked from the Madonna to Celia. Beyond the carelessly drooping\nbraids and coils of hair which blazed between the candles, he could see\nthe outline of her brow and cheek, the noble contour of her lifted chin\nand full, modelled throat, all pink as the most delicate rose leaf\nis pink, against the cool lights of the altar-like wall. The sight\nconvicted him in the court of his own soul as a prurient and mean-minded\nrustic. In the presence of such a face, of such music, there ceased to\nbe any such thing as nudity, and statues no more needed clothes than\ndid those slow, deep, magnificent chords which came now, gravely\naccumulating their spell upon him.\n\n“It is all singing!” the player called out to him over her shoulder, in\na minute of rest. “That is what Chopin does--he sings!”\n\nShe began, with an effect of thinking of something else, the Sixth\nNocturne, and Theron at first thought she was not playing anything in\nparticular, so deliberately, haltingly, did the chain of charm unwind\nitself into sequence. Then it came closer to him than the others had\ndone. The dreamy, wistful, meditative beauty of it all at once oppressed\nand inspired him. He saw Celia's shoulders sway under the impulse of the\nRUBATO license--the privilege to invest each measure with the stress of\nthe whole, to loiter, to weep, to run and laugh at will--and the music\nshe made spoke to him as with a human voice. There was the wooing sense\nof roses and moonlight, of perfumes, white skins, alluring languorous\neyes, and then--\n\n“You know this part, of course,” he heard her say.\n\nOn the instant they had stepped from the dark, scented, starlit garden,\nwhere the nightingale sang, into a great cathedral. A sombre and lofty\nanthem arose, and filled the place with the splendor of such dignified\npomp of harmony and such suggestions of measureless choral power and\nauthority that Theron sat abruptly up, then was drawn resistlessly to\nhis feet. He stood motionless in the strange room, feeling most of all\nthat one should kneel to hear such music.\n\n“This you'll know too--the funeral march from the Second Sonata,” she\nwas saying, before he realized that the end of the other had come. He\nsank upon the divan again, bending forward and clasping his hands tight\naround his knees. His heart beat furiously as he listened to the weird,\nmediaeval processional, with its wild, clashing chords held down in\nthe bondage of an orderly sadness. There was a propelling motion in\nthe thing--a sense of being borne bodily along--which affected him\nlike dizziness. He breathed hard through the robust portions of stern,\nvigorous noise, and rocked himself to and fro when, as rosy morn\nbreaks upon a storm-swept night, the drums are silenced for the sweet,\ncomforting strain of solitary melody. The clanging minor harmonies into\nwhich the march relapses came to their abrupt end. Theron rose once\nmore, and moved with a hesitating step to the piano.\n\n“I want to rest a little,” he said, with his hand on her shoulder.\n\n“Whew! so do I,” exclaimed Celia, letting her hands fall with an\nexaggerated gesture of weariness. “The sonatas take it out of one! They\nare hideously difficult, you know. They are rarely played.”\n\n“I didn't know,” remarked Theron. She seemed not to mind his hand upon\nher shoulder, and he kept it there. “I didn't know anything about music\nat all. What I do know now is that--that this evening is an event in my\nlife.”\n\nShe looked up at him and smiled. He read unsuspected tendernesses and\ntolerances of friendship in the depths of her eyes, which emboldened\nhim to stir the fingers of that audacious hand in a lingering, caressing\ntrill upon her shoulder. The movement was of the faintest, but having\nventured it, he drew his hand abruptly away.\n\n“You are getting on,” she said to him. There was an enigmatic twinkle\nin the smile with which she continued to regard him. “We are Hellenizing\nyou at a great rate.”\n\nA sudden thought seemed to strike her. She shifted her eyes toward\nvacancy with a swift, abstracted glance, reflected for a moment, then\nlet a sparkling half-wink and the dimpling beginnings of an almost\nroguish smile mark her assent to the conceit, whatever it might be.\n\n“I will be with you in a moment,” he heard her say; and while the words\nwere still in his ears she had risen and passed out of sight through\nthe broad, open doorway to the right. The looped curtains fell together\nbehind her. Presently a mellow light spread over their delicately\ntranslucent surface--a creamy, undulating radiance which gave the effect\nof moving about among the myriad folds of the silk.\n\nTheron gazed at these curtains for a little, then straightened his\nshoulders with a gesture of decision, and, turning on his heel, went\nover and examined the statues in the further corners minutely.\n\n“If you would like some more, I will play you the Berceuse now.”\n\nHer voice came to him with a delicious shock. He wheeled round and\nbeheld her standing at the piano, with one hand resting, palm upward,\non the keys. She was facing him. Her tall form was robed now in some\nshapeless, clinging drapery, lustrous and creamy and exquisitely soft,\nlike the curtains. The wonderful hair hung free and luxuriant about her\nneck and shoulders, and glowed with an intensity of fiery color which\nmade all the other hues of the room pale and vague. A fillet of faint,\nsky-like blue drew a gracious span through the flame of red above her\ntemples, and from this there rose the gleam of jewels. Her head inclined\ngently, gravely, toward him--with the posture of that armless woman in\nmarble he had been studying--and her brown eyes, regarding him from the\nshadows, emitted light.\n\n“It is a lullaby--the only one he wrote,” she said, as Theron,\npale-faced and with tightened lips, approached her. “No--you mustn't\nstand there,” she added, sinking into the seat before the instrument;\n“go back and sit where you were.”\n\nThe most perfect of lullabies, with its swaying abandonment to cooing\nrhythm, ever and again rising in ripples to the point of insisting on\nsomething, one knows not what, and then rocking, melting away once\nmore, passed, so to speak, over Theron's head. He leaned back upon the\ncushions, and watched the white, rounded forearm which the falling folds\nof this strange, statue-like drapery made bare.\n\nThere was more that appealed to his mood in the Third Ballade. It\nseemed to him that there were words going along with it--incoherent and\nimpulsive yet very earnest words, appealing to him in strenuous argument\nand persuasion. Each time he almost knew what they said, and strained\nafter their meaning with a passionate desire, and then there would come\na kind of cuckoo call, and everything would swing dancing off again into\na mockery of inconsequence.\n\nUpon the silence there fell the pure, liquid, mellifluous melody of a\nsoft-throated woman singing to her lover.\n\n“It is like Heine--simply a love-poem,” said the girl, over her\nshoulder.\n\nTheron followed now with all his senses, as she carried the Ninth\nNocturne onward. The stormy passage, which she banged finely forth,\nwas in truth a lover's quarrel; and then the mild, placid flow of sweet\nharmonies into which the furore sank, dying languorously away upon a\nsilence all alive with tender memories of sound--was that not also a\npart of love?\n\nThey sat motionless through a minute--the man on the divan, the girl\nat the piano--and Theron listened for what he felt must be the audible\nthumping of his heart.\n\nThen, throwing back her head, with upturned face, Celia began what she\nhad withheld for the last--the Sixteenth Mazurka. This strange foreign\nthing she played with her eyes closed, her head tilted obliquely so that\nTheron could see the rose-tinted, beautiful countenance, framed as if\nasleep in the billowing luxuriance of unloosed auburn hair. He fancied\nher beholding visions as she wrought the music--visions full of barbaric\ncolor and romantic forms. As his mind swam along with the gliding,\ntricksy phantom of a tune, it seemed as if he too could see these\nvisions--as if he gazed at them through her eyes.\n\nIt could not be helped. He lifted himself noiselessly to his feet, and\nstole with caution toward her. He would hear the rest of this weird,\nvoluptuous fantasy standing thus, so close behind her that he could look\ndown upon her full, uplifted lace--so close that, if she moved, that\nglowing nimbus of hair would touch him.\n\nThere had been some curious and awkward pauses in this last piece, which\nTheron, by some side cerebration, had put down to her not watching\nwhat her fingers did. There came another of these pauses now--an odd,\nunaccountable halt in what seemed the middle of everything. He stared\nintently down upon her statuesque, dreaming face during the hush, and\ncaught his breath as he waited. There fell at last a few faltering\nascending notes, making a half-finished strain, and then again there was\nsilence.\n\nCelia opened her eyes, and poured a direct, deep gaze into the face\nabove hers. Its pale lips were parted in suspense, and the color had\nfaded from its cheeks.\n\n“That is the end,” she said, and, with a turn of her lithe body, stood\nswiftly up, even while the echoes of the broken melody seemed panting in\nthe air about her for completion.\n\nTheron put his hands to his face, and pressed them tightly against eyes\nand brow for an instant. Then, throwing them aside with an expansive\ndownward sweep of the arms, and holding them clenched, he returned\nCelia's glance. It was as if he had never looked into a woman's eyes\nbefore.\n\n“It CAN'T be the end!” he heard himself saying, in a low voice charged\nwith deep significance. He held her gaze in the grasp of his with\nimplacable tenacity. There was a trouble about breathing, and the mosaic\nfloor seemed to stir under his feet. He clung defiantly to the one idea\nof not releasing her eyes.\n\n“How COULD it be the end?” he demanded, lifting an uncertain hand to\nhis breast as he spoke, and spreading it there as if to control the\ntumultuous fluttering of his heart. “Things don't end that way!”\n\nA sharp, blinding spasm of giddiness closed upon and shook him, while\nthe brave words were on his lips. He blinked and tottered under it, as\nit passed, and then backed humbly to his divan and sat down, gasping a\nlittle, and patting his hand on his heart. There was fright written all\nover his whitened face.\n\n“We--we forgot that I am a sick man,” he said feebly, answering Celia's\nlook of surprised inquiry with a forced, wan smile. “I was afraid my\nheart had gone wrong.”\n\nShe scrutinized him for a further moment, with growing reassurance\nin her air. Then, piling up the pillows and cushions behind him for\nsupport, for all the world like a big sister again, she stepped into the\ninner room, and returned with a flagon of quaint shape and a tiny glass.\nShe poured this latter full to the brim of a thick yellowish, aromatic\nliquid, and gave it him to drink.\n\n“This Benedictine is all I happen to have,” she said. “Swallow it down.\nIt will do you good.”\n\nTheron obeyed her. It brought tears to his eyes; but, upon reflection,\nit was grateful and warming. He did feel better almost immediately. A\ngreat wave of comfort seemed to enfold him as he settled himself back\non the divan. For that one flashing instant he had thought that he was\ndying. He drew a long grateful breath of relief, and smiled his content.\n\nCelia had seated herself beside him, a little away. She sat with her\nhead against the wall, and one foot curled under her, and almost faced\nhim.\n\n“I dare say we forced the pace a little,” she remarked, after a pause,\nlooking down at the floor, with the puckers of a ruminating amusement\nplaying in the corners of her mouth. “It doesn't do for a man to get to\nbe a Greek all of a sudden. He must work along up to it gradually.”\n\nHe remembered the music. “Oh, if I only knew how to tell you,” he\nmurmured ecstatically, “what a revelation your playing has been to me!\nI had never imagined anything like it. I shall think of it to my dying\nday.”\n\nHe began to remember as well the spirit that was in the air when the\nmusic ended. The details of what he had felt and said rose vaguely in\nhis mind. Pondering them, his eye roved past Celia's white-robed figure\nto the broad, open doorway beyond. The curtains behind which she had\ndisappeared were again parted and fastened back. A dim light was burning\nwithin, out of sight, and its faint illumination disclosed a room filled\nwith white marbles, white silks, white draperies of varying sorts, which\nshaped themselves, as he looked, into the canopy and trappings of an\nextravagantly over-sized and sumptuous bed. He looked away again.\n\n“I wish you would tell me what you really mean by that Greek idea of\nyours,” he said with the abruptness of confusion.\n\nCelia did not display much enthusiasm in the tone of her answer. “Oh,”\n she said almost indifferently, “lots of things. Absolute freedom from\nmoral bugbears, for one thing. The recognition that beauty is the only\nthing in life that is worth while. The courage to kick out of one's life\neverything that isn't worth while; and so on.”\n\n“But,” said Theron, watching the mingled delicacy and power of the bared\narm and the shapely grace of the hand which she had lifted to her\nface, “I am going to get you to teach it ALL to me.” The memories began\ncrowding in upon him now, and the baffling note upon which the mazurka\nhad stopped short chimed like a tuning-fork in his ears. “I want to be\na Greek myself, if you're one. I want to get as close to you--to your\nideal, that is, as I can. You open up to me a whole world that I had not\neven dreamed existed. We swore our friendship long ago, you know: and\nnow, after tonight--you and the music have decided me. I am going to put\nthe things out of MY life that are not worthwhile. Only you must help\nme; you must tell me how to begin.”\n\nHe looked up as he spoke, to enforce the almost tender entreaty of his\nwords. The spectacle of a yawn, only fractionally concealed behind those\ntalented fingers, chilled his soft speech, and sent a flush over his\nface. He rose on the instant.\n\nCelia was nothing abashed at his discovery. She laughed gayly in\nconfession of her fault, and held her hand out to let him help her\ndisentangle her foot from her draperies, and get off the divan. It\nseemed to be her meaning that he should continue holding her hand after\nshe was also standing.\n\n“You forgive me, don't you?” she urged smilingly. “Chopin always first\nexcites me, then sends me to sleep. You see how YOU sleep tonight!”\n\nThe brown, velvety eyes rested upon him, from under their heavy lids,\nwith a languorous kindliness. Her warm, large palm clasped his in frank\nliking.\n\n“I don't want to sleep at all,” Mr. Ware was impelled to say. “I want to\nlie awake and think about--about everything all over again.”\n\nShe smiled drowsily. “And you're sure you feel strong enough to walk\nhome?”\n\n“Yes,” he replied, with a lingering dilatory note, which deepened upon\nreflection into a sigh. “Oh, yes.”\n\nHe followed her and her candle down the magnificent stairway again. She\nblew the light out in the hall, and, opening the front door, stood with\nhim for a silent moment on the threshold. Then they shook hands once\nmore, and with a whispered good-night, parted.\n\nCelia, returning to the blue and yellow room, lighted a cigarette and\nhelped herself to some Benedictine in the glass which Theron had used.\nShe looked meditatively at this little glass for a moment, turning it\nabout in her fingers with a smile. The smile warmed itself suddenly into\na joyous laugh. She tossed the glass aside, and, holding out her flowing\nskirts with both hands, executed a swinging pirouette in front of the\ngravely beautiful statue of the armless woman.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nIt was apparent to the Rev. Theron Ware, from the very first moment of\nwaking next morning, that both he and the world had changed over night.\nThe metamorphosis, in the harsh toils of which he had been laboring\nblindly so long, was accomplished. He stood forth, so to speak, in a new\nskin, and looked about him, with perceptions of quite an altered kind,\nupon what seemed in every way a fresh existence. He lacked even the\nimpulse to turn round and inspect the cocoon from which he had emerged.\nLet the past bury the past. He had no vestige of interest in it.\n\nThe change was not premature. He found himself not in the least confused\nby it, or frightened. Before he had finished shaving, he knew himself\nto be easily and comfortably at home in his new state, and master of all\nits requirements.\n\nIt seemed as if Alice, too, recognized that he had become another man,\nwhen he went down and took his chair at the breakfast table. They had\nexchanged no words since their parting in the depot-yard the previous\nevening--an event now faded off into remote vagueness in Theron's\nmind. He smiled brilliantly in answer to the furtive, half-sullen,\nhalf-curious glance she stole at him, as she brought the dishes in.\n\n“Ah! potatoes warmed up in cream!” he said, with hearty pleasure in his\ntone. “What a mind-reader you are, to be sure!”\n\n“I'm glad you're feeling so much better,” she said briefly, taking her\nseat.\n\n“Better?” he returned. “I'm a new being!”\n\nShe ventured to look him over more freely, upon this assurance. He\nperceived and catalogued, one by one, the emotions which the small brain\nwas expressing through those shallow blue eyes of hers. She was\nturning over this, that, and the other hostile thought and childish\ngrievance--most of all she was dallying with the idea of asking him\nwhere he had been till after midnight. He smiled affably in the face of\nthis scattering fire of peevish glances, and did not dream of resenting\nany phase of them all.\n\n“I am going down to Thurston's this morning, and order that piano sent\nup today,” he announced presently, in a casual way.\n\n“Why, Theron, can we afford it?” the wife asked, regarding him with\nsurprise.\n\n“Oh, easily enough,” he replied light-heartedly. “You know they've\nincreased my salary.”\n\nShe shook her head. “No, I didn't. How should I? You don't realize it,”\n she went on, dolefully, “but you're getting so you don't tell me the\nleast thing about your affairs nowadays.”\n\nTheron laughed aloud. “You ought to be grateful--such melancholy affairs\nas mine have been till now,” he declared--“that is, if it weren't absurd\nto think such a thing.” Then, more soberly, he explained: “No, my girl,\nit is you who don't realize. I am carrying big projects in my mind--big,\nambitious thoughts and plans upon which great things depend. They no\ndoubt make me seem preoccupied and absent-minded; but it is a wife's\npart to understand, and make allowances, and not intrude trifles which\nmay throw everything out of gear. Don't think I'm scolding, my girl. I\nonly speak to reassure you and--and help you to comprehend. Of course I\nknow that you wouldn't willingly embarrass my--my career.”\n\n“Of course not,” responded Alice, dubiously; “but--but--”\n\n“But what? Theron felt compelled by civility to say, though on the\ninstant he reproached himself for the weakness of it.\n\n“Well--I hardly know how to say it,” she faltered, “but it was nicer in\nthe old days, before you bothered your head about big projects, and\nyour career, as you call it, and were just a good, earnest, simple young\nservant of the Lord. Oh, Theron!” she broke forth suddenly, with tearful\nzeal, “I get sometimes lately almost scared lest you should turn out to\nbe a--a BACKSLIDER!”\n\nThe husband sat upright, and hardened his countenance. But yesterday the\nword would have had in it all sorts of inherited terrors for him. This\nmorning's dawn of a new existence revealed it as merely an empty and\nstupid epithet.\n\n“These are things not to be said,” he admonished her, after a moment's\npause, and speaking with carefully measured austerity. “Least of all are\nthey to be said to a clergyman--by his wife.”\n\nIt was on the tip of Alice's tongue to retort, “Better by his wife than\nby outsiders!” but she bit her lips, and kept the gibe back. A rebuke of\nthis form and gravity was a novelty in their relations. The fear that it\nhad been merited troubled, even while it did not convince, her mind, and\nthe puzzled apprehension was to be read plainly enough on her face.\n\nTheron, noting it, saw a good deal more behind. Really, it was amazing\nhow much wiser he had grown all at once. He had been married for years,\nand it was only this morning that he suddenly discovered how a wife\nought to be handled. He continued to look sternly away into space for a\nlittle. Then his brows relaxed slowly and under the visible influence of\nmelting considerations. He nodded his head, turned toward her abruptly,\nand broke the silence with labored amiability.\n\n“Come, come--the day began so pleasantly--it was so good to feel well\nagain--let us talk about the piano instead. That is,” he added, with an\nobvious overture to playfulness, “if the thought of having a piano is\nnot too distasteful to you.”\n\nAlice yielded almost effusively to his altered mood. They went together\ninto the sitting-room, to measure and decide between the two available\nspaces which were at their disposal, and he insisted with resolute\nmagnanimity on her settling this question entirely by herself. When at\nlast he mentioned the fact that it was Friday, and he would look over\nsome sermon memoranda before he went out, Alice retired to the kitchen\nin openly cheerful spirits.\n\nTheron spread some old manuscript sermons before him on his desk,\nand took down his scribbling-book as well. But there his application\nflagged, and he surrendered himself instead, chin on hand, to staring\nout at the rhododendron in the yard. He recalled how he had seen Soulsby\npatiently studying this identical bush. The notion of Soulsby, not\nknowing at all how to sing, yet diligently learning those sixths,\nbrought a smile to his mind; and then he seemed to hear Celia calling\nout over her shoulder, “That's what Chopin does--he sings!” The spirit\nof that wonderful music came back to him, enfolded him in its wings. It\nseemed to raise itself up--a palpable barrier between him and all that\nhe had known and felt and done before. That was his new birth--that\nmarvellous night with the piano. The conceit pleased him--not the less\nbecause there flashed along with it the thought that it was a poet that\nhad been born. Yes; the former country lout, the narrow zealot, the\nuntutored slave groping about in the dark after silly superstitions,\ncringing at the scowl of mean Pierces and Winches, was dead. There was\nan end of him, and good riddance. In his place there had been born a\nPoet--he spelled the word out now unabashed--a child of light, a\nlover of beauty and sweet sounds, a recognizable brother to Renan and\nChopin--and Celia!\n\nOut of the soothing, tenderly grateful revery, a practical suggestion\nsuddenly took shape. He acted upon it without a moment's delay, getting\nout his letter-pad, and writing hurriedly--\n\n“Dear Miss Madden,--Life will be more tolerable to me if before\nnightfall I can know that there is a piano under my roof. Even if it\nremains dumb, it will be some comfort to have it here and look at it,\nand imagine how a great master might make it speak.\n\n“Would it be too much to beg you to look in at Thurston's, say at eleven\nthis forenoon, and give me the inestimable benefit of your judgment in\nselecting an instrument?\n\n“Do not trouble to answer this, for I am leaving home now, but shall\ncall at Thurston's at eleven, and wait.\n\n“Thanking you in anticipation,\n\n“I am--”\n\nHere Theron's fluency came to a sharp halt. There were adverbs enough\nand to spare on the point of his pen, but the right one was not easy to\ncome at. “Gratefully,” “faithfully,” “sincerely,” “truly”--each in turn\nstruck a false note. He felt himself not quite any of these things. At\nlast he decided to write just the simple word “yours,” and then wavered\nbetween satisfaction at his boldness, dread lest he had been over-bold,\nand, worst of the lot, fear that she would not notice it one way or\nthe other--all the while he sealed and addressed the letter, put it\ncarefully in an inner pocket, and got his hat.\n\nThere was a moment's hesitation as to notifying the kitchen of his\ndeparture. The interests of domestic discipline seemed to point the\nother way. He walked softly through the hall, and let himself out by the\nfront door without a sound.\n\nDown by the canal bridge he picked out an idle boy to his mind--a lad\nwhose aspect appeared to promise intelligence as a messenger, combined\nwith large impartiality in sectarian matters. He was to have ten\ncents on his return; and he might report himself to his patron at the\nbookstore yonder.\n\nTheron was grateful to the old bookseller for remaining at his desk in\nthe rear. There was a tacit compliment in the suggestion that he was\nnot a mere customer, demanding instant attention. Besides, there was no\nkeeping “Thurston's” out of conversations in this place.\n\nLoitering along the shelves, the young minister's eye suddenly found\nitself arrested by a name on a cover. There were a dozen narrow volumes\nin uniform binding, huddled together under a cardboard label of “Eminent\nWomen Series.” Oddly enough, one of these bore the title “George Sand.”\n Theron saw there must be some mistake, as he took the book down, and\nopened it. His glance hit by accident upon the name of Chopin. Then he\nread attentively until almost the stroke of eleven.\n\n“We have to make ourselves acquainted with all sorts of queer phases of\nlife,” he explained in self-defence to the old bookseller, then counting\nout the money for the book from his lean purse. He smiled as he added,\n“There seems something almost wrong about taking advantage of the\nclergyman's discount for a life of George Sand.”\n\n“I don't know,” answered the other, pleasantly. “Guess she wasn't\nso much different from the rest of 'em--except that she didn't mind\nappearances. We know about her. We don't know about the others.”\n\n“I must hurry,” said Theron, turning on his heel. The haste with which\nhe strode out of the store, crossed the street, and made his way toward\nThurston's, did not prevent his thinking much upon the astonishing\nthings he had encountered in this book. Their relation to Celia forced\nitself more and more upon his mind. He could recall the twinkle in\nher eye, the sub-mockery in her tone, as she commented with that\nhalf-contemptuous “Yes--George something!” upon his blundering\nignorance. His mortification at having thus exposed his dull rusticity\nwas swallowed up in conjectures as to just what her tolerant familiarity\nwith such things involved. He had never before met a young unmarried\nwoman who would have confessed to him any such knowledge. But then, of\ncourse, he had never known a girl who resembled Celia in any other way.\nHe recognized vaguely that he must provide himself with an entire new\nset of standards by which to measure and comprehend her. But it was for\nthe moment more interesting to wonder what her standards were. Did she\nobject to George Sand's behavior? Or did she sympathize with that sort\nof thing? Did those statues, and the loose-flowing diaphonous toga\nand unbound hair, the cigarettes, the fiery liqueur, the deliberately\nsensuous music--was he to believe that they signified--?\n\n“Good-morning, Mr. Ware. You have managed by a miracle to hit on one of\nmy punctual days,” said Celia.\n\nShe was standing on the doorstep, at the entrance to the musical\ndepartment of Thurston's. He had not noticed before the fact that the\nsun was shining. The full glare of its strong light, enveloping her\nfigure as she stood, and drawing the dazzled eye for relief to the bower\nof softened color, close beneath her parasol of creamy silk and lace,\nwas what struck him now first of all. It was as if Celia had brought the\nsun with her.\n\nTheron shook hands with her, and found joy in the perception, that his\nown hand trembled. He put boldly into words the thought that came to\nhim.\n\n“It was generous of you,” he said, “to wait for me out here, where all\nmight delight in the sight of you, instead of squandering the privilege\non a handful of clerks inside.”\n\nMiss Madden beamed upon him, and nodded approval.\n\n“Alcibiades never turned a prettier compliment,” she remarked. They went\nin together at this, and Theron made a note of the name.\n\nDuring the ensuing half-hour, the young minister followed about even\nmore humbly than the clerks in Celia's commanding wake. There were a\ngood many pianos in the big show-room overhead, and Theron found himself\nalmost awed by their size and brilliancy of polish, and the thought of\nthe tremendous sum of money they represented altogether. Not so with the\norganist. She ordered them rolled around this way or that, as if they\nhad been so many checkers on a draught-board. She threw back their\ncovers with the scant ceremony of a dispensary dentist opening paupers'\nmouths. She exploited their several capacities with masterful hands,\nnot deigning to seat herself, but just slightly bending forward, and\nsweeping her fingers up and down their keyboards--able, domineering\nfingers which pounded, tinkled, meditated, assented, condemned, all in\na flash, and amid what affected the layman's ears as a hopelessly\ndiscordant hubbub.\n\nTheron moved about in the group, nursing her parasol in his arms, and\nwatching her. The exaggerated deference which the clerks and salesmen\nshowed to her as the rich Miss Madden, seemed to him to be mixed with a\ncertain assertion of the claims of good-fellowship on the score of her\nbeing a musician. There undoubtedly was a sense of freemasonry between\nthem. They alluded continually in technical terms to matters of which he\nknew nothing, and were amused at remarks of hers which to him carried no\nmeaning whatever. It was evident that the young men liked her, and that\ntheir liking pleased her. It thrilled him to think that she knew he\nliked her, too, and to recall what abundant proofs she had given that\nhere, also, she had pleasure in the fact. He clung insistently to the\nmemory of these evidences. They helped him to resist a disagreeable\ntendency to feel himself an intruder, an outsider, among these\npianoforte experts.\n\nWhen it was all over, Celia waved the others aside, and talked with\nTheron. “I suppose you want me to tell you the truth,” she said.\n“There's nothing here really good. It is always much better to buy of\nthe makers direct.”\n\n“Do they sell on the instalment plan?” he asked. There was a wistful\neffect in his voice which caught her attention.\n\nShe looked away--out through the window on the street below--for\na moment. Then her eyes returned to his, and regarded him with a\ncomforting, friendly, half-motherly glance, recalling for all the world\nthe way Sister Soulsby had looked at him at odd times.\n\n“Oh, you want it at once--I see,” she remarked softly. “Well, this\nAdelberger is the best value for the money.”\n\nMr. Ware followed her finger, and beheld with dismay that it pointed\ntoward the largest instrument in the room--a veritable leviathan among\npianos. The price of this had been mentioned as $600. He turned over the\nfact that this was two-thirds his yearly salary, and found the courage\nto shake his head.\n\n“It would be too large--much too large--for the room,” he explained.\n“And, besides, it is more than I like to pay--or CAN pay, for that\nmatter.” It was pitiful to be explaining such details, but there was no\nhelp for it.\n\nThey picked out a smaller one, which Celia said was at least of fair\nquality. “Now leave all the bargaining to me,” she adjured him. “These\nprices that they talk about in the piano trade are all in the air. There\nare tremendous discounts, if one knows how to insist upon them. All\nyou have to do is to tell them to send it to your house--you wanted it\ntoday, you said?”\n\n“Yes--in memory of yesterday,” he murmured.\n\nShe herself gave the directions, and Thurston's people, now all salesmen\nagain, bowed grateful acquiescence. Then she sailed regally across the\nroom and down the stairs, drawing Theron in her train. The hirelings\nmade salaams to him as well; it would have been impossible to interpose\nanything so trivial and squalid as talk about terms and dates of\npayment.\n\n“I am ever so much obliged to you,” he said fervently, in the\ncomparative solitude of the lower floor. She had paused to look at\nsomething in the book-department.\n\n“Of course I was entirely at your service; don't mention it,” she\nreplied, reaching forth her hand in an absent way for her parasol.\n\nHe held up instead the volume he had purchased. “Guess what that is! You\nnever would guess in this wide world!” His manner was surcharged with a\nsense of the surreptitious.\n\n“Well, then, there's no good trying, IS there?” commented Celia, her\nglance roving again toward the shelves.\n\n“It is a life of George Sand,” whispered Theron. “I've been reading it\nthis morning--all the Chopin part--while I was waiting for you.”\n\nTo his surprise, there was an apparently displeased contraction of her\nbrows as he made this revelation. For the instant, a dreadful fear of\nhaving offended her seized upon and sickened him. But then her face\ncleared, as by magic. She smiled, and let her eyes twinkle in laughter\nat him, and lifted a forefinger in the most winning mockery of\nadmonition.\n\n“Naughty! naughty!” she murmured back, with a roguishly solemn wink.\n\nHe had no response ready for this, but mutely handed her the parasol.\nThe situation had suddenly grown too confused for words, or even sequent\nthoughts. Uppermost across the hurly-burly of his mind there scudded the\nsingular reflection that he should never hear her play on that new piano\nof his. Even as it flashed by out of sight, he recognized it for one of\nthe griefs of his life; and the darkness which followed seemed nothing\nbut a revolt against the idea of having a piano at all. He would\ncountermand the order. He would--but she was speaking again.\n\nThey had strolled toward the door, and her voice was as placidly\nconventional as if the talk had never strayed from the subject of\npianos. Theron with an effort pulled himself together, and laid hold of\nher words.\n\n“I suppose you will be going the other way,” she was saying. “I shall\nhave to be at the church all day. We have just got a new Mass over from\nVienna, and I'm head over heels in work at it. I can have Father Forbes\nto myself today, too. That bear of a doctor has got the rheumatism, and\ncan't come out of his cave, thank Heaven!”\n\nAnd then she was receding from view, up the sunlit, busy sidewalk, and\nTheron, standing on the doorstep, ruefully rubbed his chin. She had said\nhe was going the other way, and, after a little pause, he made her words\ngood, though each step he took seemed all in despite of his personal\ninclinations. Some of the passers-by bowed to him, and one or two\npaused as if to shake hands and exchange greetings. He nodded responses\nmechanically, but did not stop. It was as if he feared to interrupt the\nprocess of lifting his reluctant feet and propelling them forward, lest\nthey should wheel and scuttle off in the opposite direction.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nDeliberate as his progress was, the diminishing number of store-fronts\nalong the sidewalk, and the increasing proportion of picket-fences\nenclosing domestic lawns, forced upon Theron's attention the fact that\nhe was nearing home. It was a trifle past the hour for his midday meal.\nHe was not in the least hungry; still less did he feel any desire just\nnow to sit about in that library living-room of his. Why should he go\nhome at all? There was no reason whatever--save that Alice would be\nexpecting him. Upon reflection, that hardly amounted to a reason. Wives,\nwith their limited grasp of the realities of life, were always expecting\ntheir husbands to do things which it turned out not to be feasible for\nthem to do. The customary male animal spent a considerable part of his\nlife in explaining to his mate why it had been necessary to disappoint\nor upset her little plans for his comings and goings. It was in the very\nnature of things that it should be so.\n\nSustained by these considerations, Mr. Ware slackened his steps, then\nhalted irresolutely, and after a minute's hesitation, entered the small\ntemperance restaurant before which, as by intuition, he had paused. The\nelderly woman who placed on the tiny table before him the tea and rolls\nhe ordered, was entirely unknown to him, he felt sure, yet none the less\nshe smiled at him, and spoke almost familiarly--“I suppose Mrs. Ware is\nat the seaside, and you are keeping bachelor's hall?”\n\n“Not quite that,” he responded stiffly, and hurried through the meagre\nand distasteful repast, to avoid any further conversation.\n\nThere was an idea underlying her remark, however, which recurred to him\nwhen he had paid his ten cents and got out on the street again. There\nwas something interesting in the thought of Alice at the seaside.\nNeither of them had ever laid eyes on salt water, but Theron took for\ngranted the most extravagant landsman's conception of its curative and\ninvigorating powers. It was apparent to him that he was going to pay\nmuch greater attention to Alice's happiness and well-being in the future\nthan he had latterly done. He had bought her, this very day, a superb\nnew piano. He was going to simply insist on her having a hired girl. And\nthis seaside notion--why, that was best of all.\n\nHis fancy built up pleasant visions of her feasting her delighted eyes\nupon the marvel of a great ocean storm, or roaming along a beach strewn\nwith wonderful marine shells, exhibiting an innocent joy in their\nbeauty. The fresh sea-breeze blew through her hair, as he saw her in\nmind's eye, and brought the hardy flush of health back upon her rather\npallid cheeks. He was prepared already hardly to know her, so robust and\nrevivified would she have become, by the time he went down to the depot\nto meet her on her return.\n\nFor his imagination stopped short of seeing himself at the seaside.\nIt sketched instead pictures of whole weeks of solitary academic calm,\nalone with his books and his thoughts. The facts that he had no books,\nand that nobody dreamed of interfering with his thoughts, subordinated\nthemselves humbly to his mood. The prospect, as he mused fondly upon\nit, expanded to embrace the priest's and the doctor's libraries; the\nthoughts which he longed to be alone with involved close communion\nwith their thoughts. It could not but prove a season of immense mental\nstimulation and ethical broadening. It would have its lofty poetic and\nartistic side as well; the languorous melodies of Chopin stole over his\nrevery, as he dwelt upon these things, and soft azure and golden lights\nmodelled forth the exquisite outlines of tall marble forms.\n\nHe opened the gate leading to Dr. Ledsmar's house. His walk had brought\nhim quite out of the town, and up, by a broad main highway which\nyet took on all sorts of sylvan charms, to a commanding site on the\nhillside. Below, in the valley, lay Octavius, at one end half-hidden in\nfactory smoke, at the other, where narrow bands of water gleamed upon\nthe surface of a broad plain piled symmetrically with lumber, presenting\nan oddly incongruous suggestion of forest odors and the simplicity of\nthe wilderness. In the middle distance, on gradually rising ground,\nstretched a wide belt of dense, artificial foliage, peeping through\nwhich tiled turrets and ornamented chimneys marked the polite residences\nof those who, though they neither stoked the furnace fires to the west,\nnor sawed the lumber on the east, lived in purple and fine linen from\nthe profits of this toil. Nearer at hand, pastures with grazing cows on\nthe one side of the road, and the nigh, weather-stained board fence\nof the race-course on the other, completed the jumble of primitive\nrusticity and urban complications characterizing the whole picture.\n\nDr. Ledsmar's house, toward which Theron's impulses had been secretly\nleading him ever since Celia's parting remark about the rheumatism, was\nof that spacious and satisfying order of old-fashioned houses which men\nof leisure and means built for themselves while the early traditions of\na sparse and contented homogeneous population were still strong in the\nRepublic. There was a hospitable look about its wide veranda, its broad,\nlow bulk, and its big, double front door, which did not fit at all with\nthe sketch of a man-hating recluse that the doctor had drawn of himself.\n\nTheron had prepared his mind for the effect of being admitted by a\nChinaman, and was taken somewhat aback when the door was opened by the\ndoctor himself. His reception was pleasant enough, almost cordial, but\nthe sense of awkwardness followed him into his host's inner room and\nrested heavily upon his opening speech.\n\n“I heard, quite by accident, that you were ill,” he said, laying aside\nhis hat.\n\n“It's nothing at all,” replied Ledsmar. “Merely a stiff shoulder that I\nwear from time to time in memory of my father. It ought to be quite gone\nby nightfall. It was good of you to come, all the same. Sit down if you\ncan find a chair. As usual, we are littered up to our eyes here. That's\nit--throw those things on the floor.”\n\nMr. Ware carefully deposited an armful of pamphlets on the rug at his\nfeet, and sat down. Litter was indeed the word for what he saw about\nhim. Bookcases, chairs, tables, the corners of the floor, were all\nburied deep under disorderly strata of papers, diagrams, and opened\nbooks. One could hardly walk about without treading on them. The dust\nwhich danced up into the bar of sunshine streaming in from the window,\nas the doctor stepped across to another chair, gave Theron new ideas\nabout the value of Chinese servants.\n\n“I must thank you, first of all, doctor,” he began, “for your kindness\nin coming when I was ill. 'I was sick, and ye visited me.'”\n\n“You mustn't think of it that way,” said Ledsmar; “your friend came for\nme, and of course I went; and gladly too. There was nothing that I\ncould do, or that anybody could do. Very interesting man, that friend\nof yours. And his wife, too--both quite out of the common. I don't know\nwhen I've seen two such really genuine people. I should like to have\nknown more of them. Are they still here?”\n\n“They went yesterday,” Theron replied. His earlier shyness had worn off,\nand he felt comfortably at his ease. “I don't know,” he went on, “that\nthe word 'genuine' is just what would have occurred to me to describe\nthe Soulsbys. They are very interesting people, as you say--MOST\ninteresting--and there was a time, I dare say, when I should have\nbelieved in their sincerity. But of course I saw them and their\nperformance from the inside--like one on the stage of a theatre, you\nknow, instead of in the audience, and--well, I understand things better\nthan I used to.”\n\nThe doctor looked over his spectacles at him with a suggestion of\ninquiry in his glance, and Theron continued: “I had several long talks\nwith her; she told me very frankly the whole story of her life--and and\nit was decidedly queer, I can assure you! I may say to you--you will\nunderstand what I mean--that since my talk with you, and the books you\nlent me, I see many things differently. Indeed, when I think upon it\nsometimes my old state of mind seems quite incredible to me. I can use\nno word for my new state short of illumination.”\n\nDr. Ledsmar continued to regard his guest with that calm, interrogatory\nscrutiny of his. He did not seem disposed to take up the great issue of\nillumination. “I suppose,” he said after a little, “no woman can come\nin contact with a priest for any length of time WITHOUT telling him the\n'story of her life,' as you call it. They all do it. The thing amounts\nto a law.”\n\nThe young minister's veins responded with a pleasurable thrill to the\nuse of the word “priest” in obvious allusion to himself. “Perhaps in\nfairness I ought to explain,” he said, “that in her case it was only\ndone in the course of a long talk about myself. I might say that it was\nby way of kindly warning to me. She saw how I had become unsettled in\nmany--many of my former views--and she was nervous lest this should lead\nme to--to--”\n\n“To throw up the priesthood,” the doctor interposed upon his hesitation.\n“Yes, I know the tribe. Why, my dear sir, your entire profession would\nhave perished from the memory of mankind, if it hadn't been for women.\nIt is a very curious subject. Lots of thinkers have dipped into it,\nbut no one has gone resolutely in with a search-light and exploited the\nwhole thing. Our boys, for instance, traverse in their younger years all\nthe stages of the childhood of the race. They have terrifying dreams\nof awful monsters and giant animals of which they have never so much\nas heard in their waking hours; they pass through the lust for digging\ncaves, building fires, sleeping out in the woods, hunting with bows\nand arrows--all remote ancestral impulses; they play games with stones,\nmarbles, and so on at regular stated periods of the year which they\ninstinctively know, just as they were played in the Bronze Age, and\nheaven only knows how much earlier. But the boy goes through all this,\nand leaves it behind him--so completely that the grown man feels himself\nmore a stranger among boys of his own place who are thinking and doing\nprecisely the things he thought and did a few years before, than he\nwould among Kurds or Esquimaux. But the woman is totally different. She\nis infinitely more precocious as a girl. At an age when her slow brother\nis still stubbing along somewhere in the neolithic period, she has flown\nway ahead to a kind of mediaeval stage, or dawn of mediaevalism, which\nis peculiarly her own. Having got there, she stays there; she dies\nthere. The boy passes her, as the tortoise did the hare. He goes on,\nif he is a philosopher, and lets her remain in the dark ages, where she\nbelongs. If he happens to be a fool, which is customary, he stops and\nhangs around in her vicinity.”\n\nTheron smiled. “We priests,” he said, and paused again to enjoy the\nwords--“I suppose I oughtn't to inquire too closely just where we belong\nin the procession.”\n\n“We are considering the question impersonally,” said the doctor. “First\nof all, what you regard as religion is especially calculated to attract\nwomen. They remain as superstitious today, down in the marrow of their\nbones, as they were ten thousand years ago. Even the cleverest of\nthem are secretly afraid of omens, and respect auguries. Think of the\nbroadest women you know. One of them will throw salt over her shoulder\nif she spills it. Another drinks money from her cup by skimming the\nbubbles in a spoon. Another forecasts her future by the arrangement of\ntea-grounds. They make the constituency to which an institution based\non mysteries, miracles, and the supernatural generally, would naturally\nappeal. Secondly, there is the personality of the priest.”\n\n“Yes,” assented Ware. There rose up before him, on the instant, the\ngraceful, portly figure and strong, comely face of Father Forbes.\n\n“Women are not a metaphysical people. They do not easily follow\nabstractions. They want their dogmas and religious sentiments embodied\nin a man, just as they do their romantic fancies. Of course you\nProtestants, with your married clergy, see less of the effects of this\nthan celibates do, but even with you there is a great deal in it.\nWhy, the very institution of celibacy itself was forced upon the early\nChristian Church by the scandal of rich Roman ladies loading bishops\nand handsome priests with fabulous gifts until the passion for currying\nfavor with women of wealth, and marrying them or wheedling their\nfortunes from them, debauched the whole priesthood. You should read your\nJerome.”\n\n“I will--certainly,” said the listener, resolving to remember the name\nand refer it to the old bookseller.\n\n“Well, whatever laws one sect or another makes, the woman's attitude\ntoward the priest survives. She desires to see him surrounded by\nflower-pots and candles, to have him smelling of musk. She would like\nto curl his hair, and weave garlands in it. Although she is not learned\nenough to have ever heard of such things, she intuitively feels in his\npresence a sort of backwash of the old pagan sensuality and lascivious\nmysticism which enveloped the priesthood in Greek and Roman days. Ugh!\nIt makes one sick!”\n\nDr. Ledsmar rose, as he spoke, and dismissed the topic with a dry little\nlaugh. “Come, let me show you round a bit,” he said. “My shoulder is\neasier walking than sitting.”\n\n“Have you never written a book yourself?” asked Theron, getting to his\nfeet.\n\n“I have a thing on serpent-worship,” the scientist replied--“written\nyears ago.”\n\n“I can't tell you how I should enjoy reading it,” urged the other.\n\nThe doctor laughed again. “You'll have to learn German, then, I 'm\nafraid. It is still in circulation in Germany, I believe, on its merits\nas a serious book. I haven't a copy of the edition in English. THAT was\nall exhausted by collectors who bought it for its supposed obscenity,\nlike Burton's 'Arabian Nights.' Come this way, and I will show you my\nlaboratory.”\n\nThey moved out of the room, and through a passage, Ledsmar talking as\nhe led the way. “I took up that subject, when I was at college, by a\ncurious chance. I kept a young monkey in my rooms, which had been born\nin captivity. I brought home from a beer hall--it was in Germany--some\npretzels one night, and tossed one toward the monkey. He jumped toward\nit, then screamed and ran back shuddering with fright. I couldn't\nunderstand it at first. Then I saw that the curled pretzel, lying there\non the floor, was very like a little coiled-up snake. The monkey had\nnever seen a snake, but it was in his blood to be afraid of one.\nThat incident changed my whole life for me. Up to that evening, I had\nintended to be a lawyer.”\n\nTheron did not feel sure that he had understood the point of the\nanecdote. He looked now, without much interest, at some dark little\ntanks containing thick water, a row of small glass cases with adders and\nother lesser reptiles inside, and a general collection of boxes, jars,\nand similar receptacles connected with the doctor's pursuits. Further\non was a smaller chamber, with a big empty furnace, and shelves bearing\nbottles and apparatus like a drugstore.\n\nIt was pleasanter in the conservatory--a low, spacious structure with\nbroad pathways between the plants, and an awning over the sunny side\nof the roof. The plants were mostly orchids, he learned. He had read\nof them, but never seen any before. No doubt they were curious; but he\ndiscovered nothing to justify the great fuss made about them. The heat\ngrew oppressive inside, and he was glad to emerge into the garden. He\npaused under the grateful shade of a vine-clad trellis, took off his\nhat, and looked about him with a sigh of relief. Everything seemed\nold-fashioned and natural and delightfully free from pretence in the\nbig, overgrown field of flowers and shrubs.\n\nTheron recalled with some surprise Celia's indictment of the doctor as a\nman with no poetry in his soul. “You must be extremely fond of flowers,”\n he remarked.\n\nDr. Ledsmar shrugged his well shoulder. “They have their points,” he\nsaid briefly. “These are all dioecious here. Over beyond are monoecious\nspecies. My work is to test the probabilities for or against Darwin's\ntheory that hermaphroditism in plants is a late by-product of these\nearlier forms.”\n\n“And is his theory right?” asked Mr. Ware, with a polite show of\ninterest.\n\n“We may know in the course of three or four hundred years,” replied\nLedsmar. He looked up into his guest's face with a quizzical half-smile.\n“That is a very brief period for observation when such a complicated\nquestion as sex is involved,” he added. “We have been studying the\nfemale of our own species for some hundreds of thousands of years, and\nwe haven't arrived at the most elementary rules governing her actions.”\n\nThey had moved along to a bed of tall plants, the more forward of which\nwere beginning to show bloom. “Here another task will begin next month,”\n the doctor observed. “These are salvias, pentstemons, and antirrhinums,\nor snapdragons, planted very thick for the purpose. Humble-bees bore\nholes through their base, to save the labor of climbing in and out of\nthe flowers, and we don't quite know yet why some hive-bees discover and\nutilize these holes at once, while others never do. It may be merely the\nold-fogy conservatism of the individual, or there may be a law in it.”\n\nThese seemed very paltry things for a man of such wisdom to bother\nhis head about. Theron looked, as he was bidden, at the rows of hives\nshining in the hot sun on a bench along the wall, but offered no comment\nbeyond a casual, “My mother was always going to keep bees, but somehow\nshe never got around to it. They say it pays very well, though.”\n\n“The discovery of the reason why no bee will touch the nectar of the\nEPIPACTIS LATIFOLIA, though it is sweet to our taste, and wasps are\ngreedy for it, WOULD pay,” commented the doctor. “Not like a blue\nrhododendron, in mere money, but in recognition. Lots of men have\nachieved a half-column in the 'Encyclopedia Britannica' on a smaller\nbasis than that.”\n\nThey stood now at the end of the garden, before a small, dilapidated\nsummer-house. On the bench inside, facing him, Theron saw a strange\nrecumbent figure stretched at full length, apparently sound asleep, or\nit might be dead. Looking closer, with a startled surprise, he made out\nthe shaven skull and outlandish garb of a Chinaman. He turned toward his\nguide in the expectation of a scene.\n\nThe doctor had already taken out a note-book and pencil, and was drawing\nhis watch from his pocket. He stepped into the summer-house, and,\nlifting the Oriental's limp arm, took account of his pulse. Then, with\nhead bowed low, side-wise, he listened for the heart-action. Finally, he\nsomewhat brusquely pushed back one of the Chinaman's eyelids, and made\na minute inspection of what the operation disclosed. Returning to the\nlight, he inscribed some notes in his book, put it back in his pocket,\nand came out. In answer to Theron's marvelling stare, he pointed toward\na pipe of odd construction lying on the floor beneath the sleeper.\n\n“This is one of my regular afternoon duties,” he explained, again with\nthe whimsical half-smile. “I am increasing his dose monthly by regular\nstages, and the results promise to be rather remarkable. Heretofore,\nobservations have been made mostly on diseased or morbidly deteriorated\nsubjects. This fellow of mine is strong as an ox, perfectly nourished,\nand watched over intelligently. He can assimilate opium enough to kill\nyou and me and every other vertebrate creature on the premises, without\nturning a hair, and he hasn't got even fairly under way yet.”\n\nThe thing was unpleasant, and the young minister turned away. They\nwalked together up the path toward the house. His mind was full now of\nthe hostile things which Celia had said about the doctor. He had vaguely\nsympathized with her then, upon no special knowledge of his own. Now he\nfelt that his sentiments were vehemently in accord with hers. The doctor\nWAS a beast.\n\nAnd yet--as they moved slowly along through the garden the thought took\nsudden shape in his mind--it would be only justice for him to get also\nthe doctor's opinion of Celia. Even while they offended and repelled\nhim, he could not close his eyes to the fact that the doctor's\nexperiments and occupations were those of a patient and exact man of\nscience--a philosopher. And what he had said about women--there was\ncertainly a great deal of acumen and shrewd observation in that. If\nhe would only say what he really thought about Celia, and about her\nrelations with the priest! Yes, Theron recognized now there was nothing\nelse that he so much needed light upon as those puzzling ties between\nCelia and Father Forbes.\n\nHe paused, with a simulated curiosity, about one of the flower-beds.\n“Speaking of women and religion”--he began, in as casual a tone as he\ncould command--“I notice curiously enough in my own case, that as I\ndevelop in what you may call the--the other direction, my wife, who\nformerly was not especially devote, is being strongly attracted by the\nmost unthinking and hysterical side of--of our church system.”\n\nThe doctor looked at him, nodded, and stooped to nip some buds from a\nstalk in the bed.\n\n“And another case,” Theron went on--“of course it was all so new and\nstrange to me--but the position which Miss Madden seems to occupy about\nthe Catholic Church here--I suppose you had her in mind when you spoke.”\n\nLedsmar stood up. “My mind has better things to busy itself with than\nmad asses of that description,” he replied. “She is not worth talking\nabout--a mere bundle of egotism, ignorance, and red-headed lewdness. If\nshe were even a type, she might be worth considering; but she is simply\nan abnormal sport, with a little brain addled by notions that she is\nlike Hypatia, and a large impudence rendered intolerable by the fact\nthat she has money. Her father is a decent man. He ought to have her\nwhipped.”\n\nMr. Ware drew himself erect, as he listened to these outrageous words.\nIt would be unmanly, he felt, to allow such comments upon an absent\nfriend to pass unrebuked. Yet there was the courtesy due to a host to\nbe considered. His mind, fluttering between these two extremes,\nalighted abruptly upon a compromise. He would speak so as to show his\ndisapproval, yet not so as to prevent his finding out what he wanted to\nknow. The desire to hear Ledsmar talk about Celia and the priest\nseemed now to have possessed him for a long time, to have dictated his\nunpremeditated visit out here, to have been growing in intensity all the\nwhile he pretended to be interested in orchids and bees and the drugged\nChinaman. It tugged passionately at his self-control as he spoke.\n\n“I cannot in the least assent to your characterization of the lady,” he\nbegan with rhetorical dignity.\n\n“Bless me!” interposed the doctor, with deceptive cheerfulness, “that is\nnot required of you at all. It is a strictly personal opinion, offered\nmerely as a contribution to the general sum of hypotheses.”\n\n“But,” Theron went on, feeling his way, “of course, I gathered that\nevening that you had prejudices in the matter; but these are rather\napart from the point I had in view. We were speaking, you will remember,\nof the traditional attitude of women toward priests--wanting to curl\ntheir hair and put flowers in it, you know, and that suggested to me\nsome individual illustrations, and it occurred to me to wonder just what\nwere the relations between Miss Madden and--and Father Forbes. She\nsaid this morning, for instance--I happened to meet her, quite by\naccident--that she was going to the church to practise a new piece, and\nthat she could have Father Forbes to herself all day. Now that would\nbe quite an impossible remark in our--that is, in any Protestant\ncircles--and purely as a matter of comparison, I was curious to ask you\njust how much there was in it. I ask you, because going there so much\nyou have had exceptional opportunities for--”\n\nA sharp exclamation from his companion interrupted the clergyman's\nhesitating monologue. It began like a high-pitched, violent word, but\ndwindled suddenly into a groan of pain. The doctor's face, too, which\nhad on the flash of Theron's turning seemed given over to unmixed anger,\ntook on an expression of bodily suffering instead.\n\n“My shoulder has grown all at once excessively painful,” he said\nhastily. “I'm afraid I must ask you to excuse me, Mr. Ware.”\n\nCarrying the afflicted side with ostentatious caution, he led the way\nwithout ado round the house to the front gate on the road. He had put\nhis left hand under his coat to press it against his aching shoulder,\nand his right hung palpably helpless. This rendered it impossible for\nhim to shake hands with his guest in parting.\n\n“You're sure there's nothing I can do,” said Theron, lingering on the\nouter side of the gate. “I used to rub my father's shoulders and back;\nI'd gladly--”\n\n“Oh, not for worlds!” groaned the doctor. His anguish was so impressive\nthat Theron, as he walked down the road, quite missed the fact that\nthere had been no invitation to come again.\n\nDr. Ledsmar stood for a minute or two, his gaze meditatively following\nthe retreating figure. Then he went in, opening the front door with\nhis right hand, and carrying himself once more as if there were no such\nthing as rheumatism in the world. He wandered on through the hall into\nthe laboratory, and stopped in front of the row of little tanks full of\nwater.\n\nSome deliberation was involved in whatever his purpose might be, for he\nlooked from one tank to another with a pondering, dilatory gaze. At last\nhe plunged his hand into the opaque fluid and drew forth a long, slim,\nyellowish-green lizard, with a coiling, sinuous tail and a pointed, evil\nhead. The reptile squirmed and doubled itself backward around his wrist,\ndarting out and in with dizzy swiftness its tiny forked tongue.\n\nThe doctor held the thing up to the light, and, scrutinizing it through\nhis spectacles, nodded his head in sedate approval. A grim smile curled\nin his beard.\n\n“Yes, you are the type,” he murmured to it, with evident enjoyment in\nthe conceit. “Your name isn't Johnny any more. It's the Rev. Theron\nWare.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nThe annual camp-meeting of the combined Methodist districts of Octavius\nand Thessaly was held this year in the second half of September, a\nlittle later than usual. Of the nine days devoted to this curious\nsurvival of primitive Wesleyanism, the fifth fell upon a Saturday. On\nthe noon of that day the Rev. Theron Ware escaped for some hours from\nthe burden of work and incessant observation which he shared with twenty\nother preachers, and walked alone in the woods.\n\nThe scene upon which he turned his back was one worth looking at. A\nspacious, irregularly defined clearing in the forest lay level as a\ntennis-court, under the soft haze of autumn sunlight. In the centre was\na large, roughly constructed frame building, untouched by paint, but\nstained and weather-beaten with time. Behind it were some lines of\nhorse-sheds, and still further on in that direction, where the trees\nbegan, the eye caught fragmentary glimpses of low roofs and the fronts\nof tiny cottages, withdrawn from full view among the saplings and\nunderbrush. At the other side of the clearing, fully fourscore tents\nwere pitched, some gray and mended, others dazzlingly white in their\nnewness. The more remote of these tents fell into an orderly arrangement\nof semi-circular form, facing that part of the engirdling woods where\nthe trees were largest, and their canopy of overhanging foliage was\nlifted highest from the ground. Inside this half-ring of tents were many\nrounded rows of benches, which followed in narrowing lines the idea of\nan amphitheatre cut in two. In the centre, just under the edge of the\nroof of boughs, rose a wooden pagoda, in form not unlike an open-air\nstand for musicians. In front of this, and leading from it on the level\nof its floor, there projected a platform, railed round with aggressively\nrustic woodwork. The nearest benches came close about this platform.\n\nAt the hour when Theron started away, there were few enough signs of\nlife about this encampment. The four or five hundred people who were in\nconstant residence were eating their dinners in the big boarding-house,\nor the cottages or the tents. It was not the time of day for strangers.\nEven when services were in progress by daylight, the regular attendants\ndid not make much of a show, huddled in a gray-black mass at the front\nof the auditorium, by comparison with the great green and blue expanses\nof nature about them.\n\nThe real spectacle was in the evening when, as the shadows gathered, big\nclusters of kerosene torches, hung on the trees facing the audience were\nlighted. The falling darkness magnified the glow of the lights, and\nthe size and importance of what they illumined. The preacher, bending\nforward over the rails of the platform, and fastening his eyes upon the\nabashed faces of those on the “anxious seat” beneath him, borrowed an\neffect of druidical mystery from the wall of blackness about him, from\nthe flickering reflections on the branches far above, from the cool\nnight air which stirred across the clearing. The change was in the blood\nof those who saw and heard him, too. The decorum and half-heartedness\nof their devotions by day deepened under the glare of the torches into a\nfervent enthusiasm, even before the services began. And if there was in\nthe rustic pulpit a man whose prayers or exhortations could stir their\npulses, they sang and groaned and bellowed out their praises with an\nalmost barbarous license, such as befitted the wilderness.\n\nBut in the evening not all were worshippers. For a dozen miles round\non the country-side, young farm-workers and their girls regarded the\ncamp-meeting as perhaps the chief event of the year--no more to be\nmissed than the country fair or the circus, and offering, from many\npoints of view, more opportunities for genuine enjoyment than either.\nTheir behavior when they came was pretty bad--not the less so because\nall the rules established by the Presiding Elders for the regulation of\nstrangers took it for granted that they would act as viciously as\nthey knew how. These sight-seers sometimes ventured to occupy the back\nbenches where the light was dim. More often they stood outside, in the\ncircular space between the tents and the benches, and mingled cat-calls,\ndrovers' yelps, and all sorts of mocking cries and noises with the\n“Amens” of the earnest congregation. Their rough horse-play on the\nfringe of the sanctified gathering was grievous enough; everybody knew\nthat much worse things went on further out in the surrounding darkness.\nIndeed, popular report gave to these external phases of the\ncamp-meeting an even more evil fame than attached to the later moonlight\nhusking-bees, or the least reputable of the midwinter dances at Dave\nRandall's low halfway house.\n\nCynics said that the Methodists found consolation for this scandal in\nthe large income they derived from their unruly visitors' gate-money.\nThis was unfair. No doubt the money played its part, but there was\nsomething else far more important. The pious dwellers in the camp,\nintent upon reviving in their poor modern way the character and\nenvironment of the heroic early days, felt the need of just this hostile\nand scoffing mob about them to bring out the spirit they sought. Theirs\nwas pre-eminently a fighting religion, which languished in peaceful\nfair weather, but flamed high in the storm. The throng of loafers and\nlight-minded worldlings of both sexes, with their jeering interruptions\nand lewd levity of conduct, brought upon the scene a kind of visible\npersonal devil, with whom the chosen could do battle face to face. The\ndaylight services became more and more perfunctory, as the sojourn in\nthe woods ran its course, and interest concentrated itself upon the\nnight meetings, for the reason that THEN came the fierce wrestle with\na Beelzebub of flesh and blood. And it was not so one-sided a contest,\neither!\n\nNo evening passed without its victories for the pulpit. Careless or\nmischievous young people who were pushed into the foremost ranks of the\nmockers, and stood grinning and grimacing under the lights, would of\na sudden feel a spell clamped upon them. They would hear a strange,\nquavering note in the preacher's voice, catch the sense of a piercing,\nsoul-commanding gleam in his eye--not at all to be resisted. These\noccult forces would take control of them, drag them forward as in a\ndream to the benches under the pulpit, and abase them there like\nworms in the dust. And then the preacher would descend, and the elders\nadvance, and the torch-fires would sway and dip before the wind of the\nmighty roar that went up in triumph from the brethren.\n\nThese combats with Satan at close quarters, if they made the week-day\nevenings exciting, reacted with an effect of crushing dulness upon the\nSunday services. The rule was to admit no strangers to the grounds\nfrom Saturday night to Monday morning. Every year attempts were made to\nrescind or modify this rule, and this season at least three-fourths of\nthe laymen in attendance had signed a petition in favor of opening\nthe gates. The two Presiding Elders, supported by a dozen of the older\npreachers, resisted the change, and they had the backing of the more\nbigoted section of the congregation from Octavius. The controversy\nreached a point where Theron's Presiding Elder threatened to quit the\ngrounds, and the leaders of the open-Sunday movement spoke freely of the\nridiculous figure which its cranks and fanatics made poor Methodism cut\nin the eyes of modern go-ahead American civilization. Then Theron Ware\nsaw his opportunity, and preached an impromptu sermon upon the sanctity\nof the Sabbath, which ended all discussion. Sometimes its arguments\nseemed to be on one side, sometimes on the other, but always they were\nclothed with so serene a beauty of imagery, and moved in such a lofty\nand rarefied atmosphere of spiritual exaltation, that it was impossible\nto link them to so sordid a thing as this question of gate-money. When\nhe had finished, nobody wanted the gates opened. The two factions found\nthat the difference between them had melted out of existence. They sat\nentranced by the charm of the sermon; then, glancing around at the empty\nbenches, glaringly numerous in the afternoon sunlight, they whispered\nregrets that ten thousand people had not been there to hear that\nmarvellous discourse. Theron's conquest was of exceptional dimensions.\nThe majority, whose project he had defeated, were strangers who\nappreciated and admired his effort most. The little minority of his own\nflock, though less susceptible to the influence of graceful diction\nand delicately balanced rhetoric, were proud of the distinction he had\nreflected upon them, and delighted with him for having won their\nfight. The Presiding Elders wrung his hand with a significant grip. The\nextremists of his own charge beamed friendship upon him for the first\ntime. He was the veritable hero of the week.\n\nThe prestige of this achievement made it the easier for Theron to get\naway by himself next day, and walk in the woods. A man of such power\nhad a right to solitude. Those who noted his departure from the camp\nremembered with pleasure that he was to preach again on the morrow.\nHe was going to commune with God in the depths of the forest, that the\nMessage next day might be clearer and more luminous still.\n\nTheron strolled for a little, with an air of aimlessness, until he was\nwell outside the more or less frequented neighborhood of the camp.\nThen he looked at the sun and the lay of the land with that informing\nscrutiny of which the farm-bred boy never loses the trick, turned, and\nstrode at a rattling pace down the hillside. He knew nothing personally\nof this piece of woodland--a spur of the great Adirondack wilderness\nthrust southward into the region of homesteads and dairies and\nhop-fields--but he had prepared himself by a study of the map, and\nhe knew where he wanted to go. Very Soon he hit upon the path he had\ncounted upon finding, and at this he quickened his gait.\n\nThree months of the new life had wrought changes in Theron. He bore\nhimself more erectly, for one thing; his shoulders were thrown back, and\nseemed thicker. The alteration was even more obvious in his face. The\neffect of lank, wistful, sallow juvenility had vanished. It was the\ncountenance of a mature, well-fed, and confident man, firmer and more\nrounded in its outlines, and with a glow of health on its whole surface.\nUnder the chin were the suggestions of fulness which bespeak an easy\nmind. His clothes were new; the frock-coat fitted him, and the thin,\ndark-colored autumn overcoat, with its silk lining exposed at the\nbreast, gave a masculine bulk and shape to his figure. He wore a shining\ntall hat, and, in haste though he was, took pains not to knock it\nagainst low-hanging branches.\n\nAll had gone well--more than well--with him. The second Quarterly\nConference had passed without a ripple. Both the attendance and the\ncollections at his church were larger than ever before, and the tone of\nthe congregation toward him was altered distinctly for the better. As\nfor himself, he viewed with astonished delight the progress he had made\nin his own estimation. He had taken Sister Soulsby's advice, and the\nresults were already wonderful. He had put aside, once and for all, the\nthousand foolish trifles and childish perplexities which formerly had\nracked his brain, and worried him out of sleep and strength. He borrowed\nall sorts of books boldly now from the Octavius public library, and\ncould swim with a calm mastery and enjoyment upon the deep waters into\nwhich Draper and Lecky and Laing and the rest had hurled him. He dallied\npleasurably, a little languorously, with a dozen aspects of the case\nagainst revealed religion, ranging from the mild heterodoxy of Andover's\nqualms to the rude Ingersoll's rollicking negation of God himself, as a\nwoman of coquetry might play with as many would-be lovers. They amused\nhim; they were all before him to choose; and he was free to postpone\nindefinitely the act of selection. There was a sense of the luxurious in\nthis position which softened bodily as well as mental fibres. He ceased\nto grow indignant at things below or outside his standards, and he\nbought a small book which treated of the care of the hand and finger\nnails.\n\nAlice had accepted with deference his explanation that shapely hands\nplayed so important a part in pulpit oratory. For that matter, she now\naccepted whatever he said or did with admirable docility. It was months\nsince he could remember her venturing upon a critical attitude toward\nhim.\n\nShe had not wished to leave home, for the seaside or any other resort,\nduring the summer, but had worked outside in her garden more than usual.\nThis was inexpensive, and it seemed to do her as much good as a holiday\ncould have done. Her new devotional zeal was now quite an odd thing; it\nhad not slackened at all from the revival pitch. At the outset she had\ntried several times to talk with her husband upon this subject. He\nhad discouraged conversation about her soul and its welfare, at first\nobliquely, then, under compulsion, with some directness. His thoughts\nwere absorbed, he said, by the contemplation of vast, abstract schemes\nof creation and the government of the universe, and it only diverted and\nembarrassed his mind to try to fasten it upon the details of personal\nsalvation. Thereafter the topic was not broached between them.\n\nShe bestowed a good deal of attention, too, upon her piano. The knack of\na girlish nimbleness of touch had returned to her after a few weeks, and\nshe made music which Theron supposed was very good--for her. It pleased\nhim, at all events, when he sat and listened to it; but he had a far\ngreater pleasure, as he listened, in dwelling upon the memories of the\nyellow and blue room which the sounds always brought up. Although three\nmonths had passed, Thurston's had never asked for the first payment\non the piano, or even sent in a bill. This impressed him as being\npeculiarly graceful behavior on his part, and he recognized its delicacy\nby not going near Thurston's at all.\n\nAn hour's sharp walk, occasionally broken by short cuts across open\npastures, but for the most part on forest paths, brought Theron to the\nbrow of a small knoll, free from underbrush, and covered sparsely with\nbeech-trees. The ground was soft with moss and the powdered remains of\nlast year's foliage; the leaves above him were showing the first yellow\nstains of autumn. A sweet smell of ripening nuts was thick upon the\nair, and busy rustlings and chirpings through the stillness told how the\nchipmunks and squirrels were attending to their harvest.\n\nTheron had no ears for these noises of the woodland. He had halted, and\nwas searching through the little vistas offered between the stout gray\ntrunks of the beeches for some sign of a more sophisticated sort. Yes!\nthere were certainly voices to be heard, down in the hollow. And\nnow, beyond all possibility of mistake, there came up to him the low,\nrhythmic throb of music. It was the merest faint murmur of music, made\nup almost wholly of groaning bass notes, but it was enough. He moved\ndown the slope, swiftly at first, then with increasing caution. The\nsounds grew louder as he advanced, until he could hear the harmony of\nthe other strings in its place beside the uproar of the big fiddles, and\ndistinguish from both the measured noise of many feet moving as one.\n\nHe reached a place from which, himself unobserved, he could overlook\nmuch of what he had come to see.\n\nThe bottom of the glade below him lay out in the full sunshine, as flat\nand as velvety in its fresh greenness as a garden lawn. Its open expanse\nwas big enough to accommodate several distinct crowds, and here the\ncrowds were--one massed about an enclosure in which young men were\nplaying at football, another gathered further off in a horse-shoe curve\nat the end of a baseball diamond, and a third thronging at a point where\nthe shade of overhanging woods began, focussed upon a centre of interest\nwhich Theron could not make out. Closer at hand, where a shallow stream\nrippled along over its black-slate bed, some little boys, with legs\nbared to the thighs, were paddling about, under the charge of two men\nclad in long black gowns. There were others of these frocked monitors\nscattered here and there upon the scene--pallid, close-shaven, monkish\nfigures, who none the less wore modern hats, and superintended with\nknowledge the games of the period. Theron remembered that these were the\nChristian Brothers, the semi-monastic teachers of the Catholic school.\n\nAnd this was the picnic of the Catholics of Octavius. He gazed in\nmingled amazement and exhilaration upon the spectacle. There seemed\nto be literally thousands of people on the open fields before him, and\napparently there were still other thousands in the fringes of the woods\nround about. The noises which arose from this multitude--the shouts of\nthe lads in the water, the playful squeals of the girls in the swings,\nthe fused uproar of the more distant crowds, and above all the diligent,\nordered strains of the dance-music proceeding from some invisible\ndistance in the greenwood--charmed his ears with their suggestion of\nuniversal merriment. He drew a long breath--half pleasure, half wistful\nregret--as he remembered that other gathering in the forest which he had\nleft behind.\n\nAt any rate, it should be well behind him today, whatever the morrow\nmight bring! Evidently he was on the wrong side of the circle for the\nheadquarters of the festivities. He turned and walked to the right\nthrough the beeches, making a detour, under cover, of the crowds at\nplay. At last he rounded the long oval of the clearing, and found\nhimself at the very edge of that largest throng of all, which had been\ntoo far away for comprehension at the beginning. There was no mystery\nnow. A rough, narrow shed, fully fifty feet in length, imposed itself\nin an arbitrary line across the face of this crowd, dividing it into two\ncompact halves. Inside this shed, protected all round by a waist-high\nbarrier of boards, on top of which ran a flat, table-like covering, were\ntwenty men in their shirt-sleeves, toiling ceaselessly to keep abreast\nof the crowd's thirst for beer. The actions of these bartenders greatly\nimpressed Theron. They moved like so many machines, using one\nhand, apparently, to take money and give change, and with the other\nincessantly sweeping off rows of empty glasses, and tossing forward in\ntheir place fresh, foaming glasses five at a time. Hundreds of arms and\nhands were continually stretched out, on both sides of the shed, toward\nthis streaming bar, and through the babel of eager cries rose without\npause the racket of mallets tapping new kegs.\n\nTheron had never seen any considerable number of his fellow-citizens\nengaged in drinking lager beer before. His surprise at the facility of\nthose behind the bar began to yield, upon observation, to a profound\namazement at the thirst of those before it. The same people seemed to\nbe always in front, emptying the glasses faster than the busy men inside\ncould replenish them, and clamoring tirelessly for more. Newcomers had\nto force their way to the bar by violent efforts, and once there they\nstayed until pushed bodily aside. There were actually women to be seen\nhere and there in the throng, elbowing and shoving like the rest for a\nplace at the front. Some of the more gallant young men fought their\nway outward, from time to time, carrying for safety above their heads\nglasses of beer which they gave to young and pretty girls standing on\nthe fringe of the crowd, among the trees.\n\nEverywhere a remarkable good-humor prevailed. Once a sharp fight broke\nout, just at the end of the bar nearest Theron, and one young man was\nknocked down. A rush of the onlookers confused everything before the\nminister's eyes for a minute, and then he saw the aggrieved combatant up\non his legs again, consenting under the kindly pressure of the crowd to\nshake hands with his antagonist, and join him in more beer. The incident\ncaught his fancy. There was something very pleasingly human, he thought,\nin this primitive readiness to resort to fisticuffs, and this frank and\ngenial reconciliation.\n\nPerhaps there was something contagious in this wholesale display of\nthirst, for the Rev. Mr. Ware became conscious of a notion that he\nshould like to try a glass of beer. He recalled having heard that\nlager was really a most harmless beverage. Of course it was out of the\nquestion that he should show himself at the bar. Perhaps some one would\nbring him out a glass, as if he were a pretty girl. He looked about for\na possible messenger. Turning, he found himself face to face with two\nsmiling people, into whose eyes he stared for an instant in dumfounded\nblankness. Then his countenance flashed with joy, and he held out both\nhands in greeting. It was Father Forbes and Celia.\n\n“We stole down upon you unawares,” said the priest, in his cheeriest\nmanner. He wore a brown straw hat, and loose clothes hardly at all\nclerical in form, and had Miss Madden's arm drawn lightly within his\nown. “We could barely believe our eyes--that it could be you whom we\nsaw, here among the sinners!”\n\n“I am in love with your sinners,” responded Theron, as he shook hands\nwith Celia, and trusted himself to look fully into her eyes. “I've had\nfive days of the saints, over in another part of the woods, and they've\nbored the head off me.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nAt the command of Father Forbes, a lad who was loitering near them went\ndown through the throng to the bar, and returned with three glasses of\nbeer. It pleased the Rev. Mr. Ware that the priest should have taken\nit for granted that he would do as the others did. He knocked his glass\nagainst theirs in compliance with a custom strange to him, but which\nthey seemed to understand very well. The beer itself was not so\nagreeable to the taste as he had expected, but it was cold and\nrefreshing.\n\nWhen the boy had returned with the glasses, the three stood for a moment\nin silence, meditatively watching the curious scene spread below them.\nBeyond the bar, Theron could catch now through the trees regularly\nrecurring glimpses of four or five swings in motion. These were nearest\nhim, and clearest to the vision as well, at the instant when they\nreached their highest forward point. The seats were filled with girls,\nsome of them quite grown young women, and their curving upward sweep\nthrough the air was disclosing at its climax a remarkable profusion of\nwhite skirts and black stockings. The sight struck him as indecorous in\nthe extreme, and he turned his eyes away. They met Celia's; and there\nwas something latent in their brown depths which prompted him, after a\nbrief dalliance of interchanging glances, to look again at the swings.\n\n“That old maid Curran is really too ridiculous, with those white\nstockings of hers,” remarked Celia; “some friend ought to tell her to\ndye them.”\n\n“Or pad them,” suggested Father Forbes, with a gay little chuckle. “I\ndaresay the question of swings and ladies' stockings hardly arises with\nyou, over at the camp-meeting, Mr. Ware?”\n\nTheron laughed aloud at the conceit. “I should say not!” he replied.\n\n“I'm just dying to see a camp-meeting!” said Celia. “You hear such racy\naccounts of what goes on at them.”\n\n“Don't go, I beg of you!” urged Theron, with doleful emphasis. “Don't\nlet's even talk about them. I should like to feel this afternoon as if\nthere was no such thing within a thousand miles of me as a camp-meeting.\nDo you know, all this interests me enormously. It is a revelation to me\nto see these thousands of good, decent, ordinary people, just frankly\nenjoying themselves like human beings. I suppose that in this whole huge\ncrowd there isn't a single person who will mention the subject of his\nsoul to any other person all day long.”\n\n“I should think the assumption was a safe one,” said the priest,\nsmilingly, “unless,” he added on afterthought, “it be by way of a genial\nprofanity. There used to be some old Clare men who said 'Hell to my\nsoul!' when they missed at quoits, but I haven't heard it for a long\ntime. I daresay they're all dead.”\n\n“I shall never forget that death-bed--where I saw you first,” remarked\nTheron, musingly. “I date from that experience a whole new life. I have\nbeen greatly struck lately, in reading our 'Northern Christian Advocate'\nto see in the obituary notices of prominent Methodists how over and over\nagain it is recorded that they got religion in their youth through being\nfrightened by some illness of their own, or some epidemic about them.\nThe cholera year of 1832 seems to have made Methodists hand over\nfist. Even to this day our most successful revivalists, those who work\nconversions wholesale wherever they go, do it more by frightful pictures\nof hell-fire surrounding the sinner's death-bed than anything else.\nYou could hear the same thing at our camp-meeting tonight, if you were\nthere.”\n\n“There isn't so much difference as you think,” said Father Forbes,\ndispassionately. “Your people keep examining their souls, just as\nchildren keep pulling up the bulbs they have planted to see are there\nany roots yet. Our people are more satisfied to leave their souls alone,\nonce they have been planted, so to speak, by baptism. But fear of hell\ngoverns them both, pretty much alike. As I remember saying to you once\nbefore, there is really nothing new under the sun. Even the saying isn't\nnew. Though there seem to have been the most tremendous changes in\nraces and civilizations and religions, stretching over many thousands\nof years, yet nothing is in fact altered very much. Where religions are\nconcerned, the human race are still very like savages in a dangerous\nwood in the dark, telling one another ghost stories around a camp-fire.\nThey have always been like that.”\n\n“What nonsense!” cried Celia. “I have no patience with such gloomy\nrubbish. The Greeks had a religion full of beauty and happiness and\nlight-heartedness, and they weren't frightened of death at all. They\nmade the image of death a beautiful boy, with a torch turned down. Their\ngreatest philosophers openly preached and practised the doctrine of\nsuicide when one was tired of life. Our own early Church was full of\nthese broad and beautiful Greek ideas. You know that yourself! And it\nwas only when your miserable Jeromes and Augustines and Cyrils brought\nin the abominable meannesses and cruelties of the Jewish Old Testament,\nand stamped out the sane and lovely Greek elements in the Church,\nthat Christians became the poor, whining, cowardly egotists they are,\ntroubling about their little tin-pot souls, and scaring themselves in\ntheir churches by skulls and crossbones.”\n\n“My dear Celia,” interposed the priest, patting her shoulder gently, “we\nwill have no Greek debate today. Mr. Ware has been permitted to taboo\ncamp-meetings, and I claim the privilege to cry off on Greeks. Look at\nthose fellows down there, trampling over one another to get more beer.\nWhat have they to do with Athens, or Athens with them? I take it, Mr.\nWare,” he went on, with a grave face but a twinkling eye, “that what we\nare observing here in front of us is symbolical of a great ethical\nand theological revolution, which in time will modify and control the\ndestiny of the entire American people. You see those young Irishmen\nthere, struggling like pigs at a trough to get their fill of German\nbeer. That signifies a conquest of Teuton over Kelt more important and\nfar-reaching in its results than the landing of Hengist and Horsa.\nThe Kelt has come to grief heretofore--or at least been forced to play\nsecond fiddle to other races--because he lacked the right sort of a\ndrink. He has in his blood an excess of impulsive, imaginative, even\nfantastic qualities. It is much easier for him to make a fool of\nhimself, to begin with, than it is for people of slower wits and more\nsluggish temperaments. When you add whiskey to that, or that essence of\nmelancholia which in Ireland they call 'porther,' you get the Kelt at\nhis very weakest and worst. These young men down there are changing all\nthat. They have discovered lager. Already many of them can outdrink\nthe Germans at their own beverage. The lager-drinking Irishman in a few\ngenerations will be a new type of humanity--the Kelt at his best. He\nwill dominate America. He will be THE American. And his church--with\nthe Italian element thrown clean out of it, and its Pope living, say, in\nBaltimore or Georgetown--will be the Church of America.”\n\n“Let us have some more lager at once,” put in Celia. “This revolution\ncan't be hurried forward too rapidly.”\n\nTheron could not feel sure how much of the priest's discourse was in\njest, how much in earnest. “It seems to me,” he said, “that as things\nare going, it doesn't look much as if the America of the future will\ntrouble itself about any kind of a church. The march of science must\nvery soon produce a universal scepticism. It is in the nature of human\nprogress. What all intelligent men recognize today, the masses must\nsurely come to see in time.”\n\nFather Forbes laughed outright this time. “My dear Mr. Ware,” he said,\nas they touched glasses again, and sipped the fresh beer that had been\nbrought them, “of all our fictions there is none so utterly baseless\nand empty as this idea that humanity progresses. The savage's natural\nimpression is that the world he sees about him was made for him, and\nthat the rest of the universe is subordinated to him and his world, and\nthat all the spirits and demons and gods occupy themselves exclusively\nwith him and his affairs. That idea was the basis of every pagan\nreligion, and it is the basis of the Christian religion, simply because\nit is the foundation of human nature. That foundation is just as firm\nand unshaken today as it was in the Stone Age. It will always\nremain, and upon it will always be built some kind of a religious\nsuperstructure. 'Intelligent men,' as you call them, really have very\nlittle influence, even when they all pull one way. The people as a whole\nsoon get tired of them. They give too much trouble. The most powerful\nforces in human nature are self-protection and inertia. The middle-aged\nman has found out that the chief wisdom in life is to bend to the\npressures about him, to shut up and do as others do. Even when he thinks\nhe has rid his own mind of superstitions, he sees that he will best\nenjoy a peaceful life by leaving other peoples' superstitions alone.\nThat is always the ultimate view of the crowd.”\n\n“But I don't see,” observed Theron, “granting that all this is true, how\nyou think the Catholic Church will come out on top. I could understand\nit of Unitarianism, or Universalism, or the Episcopal Church, where\nnobody seems to have to believe particularly in anything except the\nbeauty of its burial service, but I should think the very rigidity of\nthe Catholic creed would make it impossible. There everything is hard\nand fast; nothing is elastic; there is no room for compromise.”\n\n“The Church is always compromising,” explained the priest, “only it does\nit so slowly that no one man lives long enough to quite catch it at the\ntrick. No; the great secret of the Catholic Church is that it doesn't\ndebate with sceptics. No matter what points you make against it, it\nis never betrayed into answering back. It simply says these things are\nsacred mysteries, which you are quite free to accept and be saved, or\nreject and be damned. There is something intelligible and fine about\nan attitude like that. When people have grown tired of their absurd and\nfruitless wrangling over texts and creeds which, humanly speaking, are\nall barbaric nonsense, they will come back to repose pleasantly under\nthe Catholic roof, in that restful house where things are taken for\ngranted. There the manners are charming, the service excellent, the\ndecoration and upholstery most acceptable to the eye, and the music”--he\nmade a little mock bow here to Celia--“the music at least is divine.\nThere you have nothing to do but be agreeable, and avoid scandal, and\nobserve the convenances. You are no more expected to express doubts\nabout the Immaculate Conception than you are to ask the lady whom you\ntake down to dinner how old she is. Now that is, as I have said,\nan intelligent and rational church for people to have. As the Irish\ncivilize themselves--you observe them diligently engaged in the process\ndown below there--and the social roughness of their church becomes\nsoftened and ameliorated, Americans will inevitably be attracted toward\nit. In the end, it will embrace them all, and be modified by them, and\nin turn influence their development, till you will have a new nation and\na new national church, each representative of the other.”\n\n“And all this is to be done by lager beer!” Theron ventured to comment,\njokingly. He was conscious of a novel perspiration around the bridge of\nhis nose, which was obviously another effect of the drink.\n\nThe priest passed the pleasantry by. “No,” he said seriously; “what you\nmust see is that there must always be a church. If one did not exist, it\nwould be necessary to invent it. It is needed, first and foremost, as a\npolice force. It is needed, secondly, so to speak, as a fire insurance.\nIt provides the most even temperature and pure atmosphere for the growth\nof young children. It furnishes the best obtainable social machinery for\nmarrying off one's daughters, getting to know the right people, patching\nup quarrels, and so on. The priesthood earn their salaries as the agents\nfor these valuable social arrangements. Their theology is thrown in as\na sort of intellectual diversion, like the ritual of a benevolent\norganization. There are some who get excited about this part of it, just\nas one hears of Free-Masons who believe that the sun rises and sets to\nexemplify their ceremonies. Others take their duties more quietly, and,\nunderstanding just what it all amounts to, make the best of it, like you\nand me.”\n\nTheron assented to the philosophy and the compliment by a grave bow.\n“Yes, that is the idea--to make the best of it,” he said, and fastened\nhis regard boldly this time upon the swings.\n\n“We were both ordained by our bishops,” continued the priest, “at an\nage when those worthy old gentlemen would not have trusted our combined\nwisdom to buy a horse for them.”\n\n“And I was married,” broke in Theron, with an eagerness almost vehement,\n“when I had only just been ordained! At the worst, YOU had only the\nChurch fastened upon your back, before you were old enough to know\nwhat you wanted. It is easy enough to make the best of THAT, but it is\ndifferent with me.”\n\nA marked silence followed this outburst. The Rev. Mr. Ware had never\nspoken of his marriage to either of these friends before; and something\nin their manner seemed to suggest that they did not find the subject\ninviting, now that it had been broached. He himself was filled with a\ndesire to say more about it. He had never clearly realized before what\na genuine grievance it was. The moisture at the top of his nose merged\nitself into tears in the corners of his eyes, as the cruel enormity of\nthe sacrifice he had made in his youth rose before him. His whole life\nhad been fettered and darkened by it. He turned his gaze from the swings\ntoward Celia, to claim the sympathy he knew she would feel for him.\n\nBut Celia was otherwise engaged. A young man had come up to her--a tall\nand extremely thin young man, soberly dressed, and with a long, gaunt,\nhollow-eyed face, the skin of which seemed at once florid and pale. He\nhad sandy hair and the rough hands of a workman; but he was speaking to\nMiss Madden in the confidential tones of an equal.\n\n“I can do nothing at all with him,” this newcomer said to her. “He'll\nnot be said by me. Perhaps he'd listen to you!”\n\n“It's likely I'll go down there!” said Celia. “He may do what he likes\nfor all me! Take my advice, Michael, and just go your way, and leave\nhim to himself. There was a time when I would have taken out my eyes\nfor him, but it was love wasted and thrown away. After the warnings he's\nhad, if he WILL bring trouble on himself, let's make it no affair of\nours.”\n\nTheron had found himself exchanging glances of inquiry with this young\nman. “Mr. Ware,” said Celia, here, “let me introduce you to my brother\nMichael--my full brother.”\n\nMr. Ware remembered him now, and began, in response to the other's\nformal bow, to say something about their having met in the dark, inside\nthe church. But Celia held up her hand. “I'm afraid, Mr. Ware,” she said\nhurriedly, “that you are in for a glimpse of the family skeleton. I will\napologize for the infliction in advance.”\n\nWonderingly, Theron followed her look, and saw another young man who\nhad come up the path from the crowd below, and was close upon them. The\nminister recognized in him a figure which had seemed to be the centre of\nalmost every group about the bar that he had studied in detail. He was\na small, dapper, elegantly attired youth, with dark hair, and the\nhandsome, regularly carved face of an actor. He advanced with a smiling\ncountenance and unsteady step--his silk hat thrust back upon his head,\nhis frock-coat and vest unbuttoned, and his neckwear disarranged--and\nsaluted the company with amiability.\n\n“I saw you up here, Father Forbes,” he said, with a thickened and\nerratic utterance. “Whyn't you come down and join us? I'm setting 'em up\nfor everybody. You got to take care of the boys, you know. I'll blow in\nthe last cent I've got in the world for the boys, every time, and they\nknow it. They're solider for me than they ever were for anybody. That's\nhow it is. If you stand by the boys, the boys'll stand by you. I'm going\nto the Assembly for this district, and they ain't nobody can stop me.\nThe boys are just red hot for me. Wish you'd come down, Father Forbes,\nand address a few words to the meeting--just mention that I'm a\ncandidate, and say I'm bound to win, hands down. That'll make you solid\nwith the boys, and we'll be all good fellows together. Come on down!”\n\nThe priest affably disengaged his arm from the clutch which the speaker\nhad laid upon it, and shook his head in gentle deprecation. “No, no; you\nmust excuse me, Theodore,” he said. “We mustn't meddle in politics, you\nknow.”\n\n“Politics be damned!” urged Theodore, grabbing the priest's other arm,\nand tugging at it stoutly to pull him down the path. “I say, boys” he\nshouted to those below, “here's Father Forbes, and he's going to come\ndown and address the meeting. Come on, Father! Come down, and have a\ndrink with the boys!”\n\nIt was Celia who sharply pulled his hand away from the priest's arm\nthis time. “Go away with you!” she snapped in low, angry tones at the\nintruder. “You should be ashamed of yourself! If you can't keep sober\nyourself, you can at least keep your hands off the priest. I should\nthink you'd have more decency, when you're in such a state as this, than\nto come where I am. If you've no respect for yourself, you might have\nthat much respect for me! And before strangers, too!\n\n“Oh, I mustn't come where YOU are, eh?” remarked the peccant Theodore,\nstraightening himself with an elaborate effort. “You've bought these\nwoods, have you? I've got a hundred friends here, all the same, for\nevery one you'll ever have in your life, Red-head, and don't you forget\nit.”\n\n“Go and spend your money with them, then, and don't come insulting\ndecent people,” said Celia.\n\n“Before strangers, too!” the young man called out, with beery sarcasm.\n“Oh, we'll take care of the strangers all right.” He had not seemed to\nbe aware of Theron's presence, much less his identity, before; but he\nturned to him now with a knowing grin. “I'm running for the Assembly,\nMr. Ware,” he said, speaking loudly and with deliberate effort to avoid\nthe drunken elisions and comminglings to which his speech tended, “and I\nwant you to fix up the Methodists solid for me. I'm going to drive over\nto the camp-meeting tonight, me and some of the boys in a barouche, and\nI'll put a twenty-dollar bill on their plate. Here it is now, if you\nwant to see it.”\n\nAs the young man began fumbling in a vest-pocket, Theron gathered his\nwits together.\n\n“You'd better not go this evening,” he said, as convincingly as he\nknew how; “because the gates will be closed very early, and the\nSaturday-evening services are of a particularly special nature, quite\nreserved for those living on the grounds.”\n\n“Rats!” said Theodore, raising his head, and abandoning the search for\nthe bill. “Why don't you speak out like a man, and say you think I'm too\ndrunk?”\n\n“I don't think that is a question which need arise between us, Mr.\nMadden,” murmured Theron, confusedly.\n\n“Oh, don't you make any mistake! A hell of a lot of questions arise\nbetween us, Mr. Ware,” cried Theodore, with a sudden accession of vigor\nin tone and mien. “And one of 'em is--go away from me, Michael!--one of\n'em is, I say, why don't you leave our girls alone? They've got their\nown priests to make fools of themselves over, without any sneak of a\nProtestant parson coming meddling round them. You're a married man into\nthe bargain; and you've got in your house this minute a piano that my\nsister bought and paid for. Oh, I've seen the entry in Thurston's books!\nYou have the cheek to talk to me about being drunk--why--”\n\nThese remarks were never concluded, for Father Forbes here clapped a\nhand abruptly over the offending mouth, and flung his free arm in a\ntight grip around the young man's waist. “Come with me, Michael!” he\nsaid, and the two men led the reluctant and resisting Theodore at a\nsharp pace off into the woods.\n\nTheron and Celia stood and watched them disappear among the undergrowth.\n“It's the dirty Foley blood that's in him,” he heard her say, as if\nbetween clenched teeth.\n\nThe girl's big brown eyes, when Theron looked into them again, were\nstill fixed upon the screen of foliage, and dilated like those of a\nMedusa mask. The blood had gone away, and left the fair face and neck\nas white, it seemed to him, as marble. Even her lips, fiercely bitten\ntogether, appeared colorless. The picture of consuming and powerless\nrage which she presented, and the shuddering tremor which ran over her\nform, as visible as the quivering track of a gust of wind across a pond,\nawed and frightened him.\n\nTenderness toward her helpless state came too, and uppermost. He drew\nher arm into his, and turned their backs upon the picnic scene.\n\n“Let us walk a little up the path into the woods,” he said, “and get\naway from all this.”\n\n“The further away the better,” she answered bitterly, and he felt the\nshiver run through her again as she spoke.\n\nThe methodical waltz-music from that unseen dancing platform rose again\nabove all other sounds. They moved up the woodland path, their steps\ninsensibly falling into the rhythm of its strains, and vanished from\nsight among the trees.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nTheron and Celia walked in silence for some minutes, until the noises\nof the throng they had left behind were lost. The path they followed had\ngrown indefinite among the grass and creepers of the forest carpet;\nnow it seemed to end altogether in a little copse of young birches, the\ndelicately graceful stems of which were clustered about a parent stump,\nlong since decayed and overgrown with lichens and layers of thick moss.\n\nAs the two paused, the girl suddenly sank upon her knees, then threw\nherself face forward upon the soft green bark which had formed itself\nabove the roots of the ancient mother-tree. Her companion looked down\nin pained amazement at what he saw. Her body shook with the violence\nof recurring sobs, or rather gasps of wrath and grief Her hands, with\nstiffened, claw-like fingers, dug into the moss and tangle of tiny\nvines, and tore them by the roots. The half-stifled sounds of weeping\nthat arose from where her face grovelled in the leaves were terrible\nto his ears. He knew not what to say or do, but gazed in resourceless\nsuspense at the strange figure she made. It seemed a cruelly long time\nthat she lay there, almost at his feet, struggling fiercely with the\nfury that was in her.\n\nAll at once the paroxysms passed away, the sounds of wild weeping\nceased. Celia sat up, and with her handkerchief wiped the tears and\nleafy fragments from her face. She rearranged her hat and the braids of\nher hair with swift, instinctive touches, brushed the woodland debris\nfrom her front, and sprang to her feet.\n\n“I'm all right now,” she said briskly. There was palpable effort in her\nlight tone, and in the stormy sort of smile which she forced upon her\nblotched and perturbed countenance, but they were only too welcome to\nTheron's anxious mood.\n\n“Thank God!” he blurted out, all radiant with relief. “I feared you were\ngoing to have a fit--or something.”\n\nCelia laughed, a little artificially at first, then with a genuine\nsurrender to the comic side of his visible fright. The mirth came back\ninto the brown depths of her eyes again, and her face cleared itself of\ntear-stains and the marks of agitation. “I AM a nice quiet party for\na Methodist minister to go walking in the woods with, am I not?” she\ncried, shaking her skirts and smiling at him.\n\n“I am not a Methodist minister--please!” answered Theron--“at least not\ntoday--and here--with you! I am just a man--nothing more--a man who has\nescaped from lifelong imprisonment, and feels for the first time what it\nis to be free!”\n\n“Ah, my friend,” Celia said, shaking her head slowly, “I'm afraid you\ndeceive yourself. You are not by any means free. You are only looking\nout of the window of your prison, as you call it. The doors are locked,\njust the same.”\n\n“I will smash them!” he declared, with confidence. “Or for that matter,\nI HAVE smashed them--battered them to pieces. You don't realize what\nprogress I have made, what changes there have been in me since that\nnight, you remember that wonderful night! I am quite another being, I\nassure you! And really it dates from way beyond that--why, from the very\nfirst evening, when I came to you in the church. The window in Father\nForbes' room was open, and I stood by it listening to the music next\ndoor, and I could just faintly see on the dark window across the\nalley-way a stained-glass picture of a woman. I suppose it was the\nVirgin Mary. She had hair like yours, and your face, too; and that is\nwhy I went into the church and found you. Yes, that is why.”\n\nCelia regarded him with gravity. “You will get yourself into great\ntrouble, my friend,” she said.\n\n“That's where you're wrong,” put in Theron. “Not that I'd mind any\ntrouble in this wide world, so long as you called me 'my friend,' but\nI'm not going to get into any at all. I know a trick worth two of that.\nI've learned to be a showman. I can preach now far better than I used\nto, and I can get through my work in half the time, and keep on the\nright side of my people, and get along with perfect smoothness. I\nwas too green before. I took the thing seriously, and I let every\nmean-fisted curmudgeon and crazy fanatic worry me, and keep me on pins\nand needles. I don't do that any more. I've taken a new measure of life.\nI see now what life is really worth, and I'm going to have my share of\nit. Why should I deliberately deny myself all possible happiness for the\nrest of my days, simply because I made a fool of myself when I was in my\nteens? Other men are not eternally punished like that, for what they\ndid as boys, and I won't submit to it either. I will be as free to enjoy\nmyself as--as Father Forbes.”\n\nCelia smiled softly, and shook her head again. “Poor man, to call HIM\nfree!” she said: “why, he is bound hand and foot. You don't in the least\nrealize how he is hedged about, the work he has to do, the thousand\nsuspicious eyes that watch his every movement, eager to bring the Bishop\ndown upon him. And then think of his sacrifice--the great sacrifice of\nall--to never know what love means, to forswear his manhood, to live\na forlorn, celibate life--you have no idea how sadly that appeals to a\nwoman.”\n\n“Let us sit down here for a little,” said Theron; “we seem at the end of\nthe path.” She seated herself on the root-based mound, and he reclined\nat her side, with an arm carelessly extended behind her on the moss.\n\n“I can see what you mean,” he went on, after a pause. “But to me, do you\nknow, there is an enormous fascination in celibacy. You forget that I\nknow the reverse of the medal. I know how the mind can be cramped, the\nnerves harassed, the ambitions spoiled and rotted, the whole existence\ndarkened and belittled, by--by the other thing. I have never talked to\nyou before about my marriage.”\n\n“I don't think we'd better talk about it now,” observed Celia. “There\nmust be many more amusing topics.”\n\nHe missed the spirit of her remark. “You are right,” he said slowly. “It\nis too sad a thing to talk about. But there! it is my load, and I bear\nit, and there's nothing more to be said.”\n\nTheron drew a heavy sigh, and let his fingers toy abstractedly with a\nribbon on the outer edge of Celia's penumbra of apparel.\n\n“No,” she said. “We mustn't snivel, and we mustn't sulk. When I get into\na rage it makes me ill, and I storm my way through it and tear things,\nbut it doesn't last long, and I come out of it feeling all the better.\nI don't know that I've ever seen your wife. I suppose she hasn't got red\nhair?”\n\n“I think it's a kind of light brown,” answered Theron, with an effect of\nexerting his memory.\n\n“It seems that you only take notice of hair in stained-glass windows,”\n was Celia's comment.\n\n“Oh-h!” he murmured reproachfully, “as if--as if--but I won't say what I\nwas going to.”\n\n“That's not fair!” she said. The little touch of whimsical mockery which\nshe gave to the serious declaration was delicious to him. “You have me\nat such a disadvantage! Here am I rattling out whatever comes into my\nhead, exposing all my lightest emotions, and laying bare my very heart\nin candor, and you meditate, you turn things over cautiously in your\nmind, like a second Machiavelli. I grow afraid of you; you are so subtle\nand mysterious in your reserves.”\n\nTheron gave a tug at the ribbon, to show the joy he had in her delicate\nchaff. “No, it is you who are secretive,” he said. “You never told me\nabout--about the piano.”\n\nThe word was out! A minute before it had seemed incredible to him that\nhe should ever have the courage to utter it--but here it was. He laid\nfirm hold upon the ribbon, which it appeared hung from her waist, and\ndrew himself a trifle nearer to her. “I could never have consented to\ntake it, I'm afraid,” he went on in a low voice, “if I had known. And\neven as it is, I fear it won't be possible.”\n\n“What are you afraid of?” asked Celia. “Why shouldn't you take it?\nPeople in your profession never do get anything unless it's given to\nthem, do they? I've always understood it was like that. I've often\nread of donation parties--that's what they're called, isn't it?--where\neverybody is supposed to bring some gift to the minister. Very well,\nthen, I've simply had a donation party of my own, that's all. Unless\nyou mean that my being a Catholic makes a difference. I had supposed you\nwere quite free from that kind of prejudice.”\n\n“So I am! Believe me, I am!” urged Theron. “When I'm with you, it seems\nimpossible to realize that there are people so narrow and contracted\nin their natures as to take account of such things. It is another\natmosphere that I breathe near you. How could you imagine that such a\nthought--about our difference of creed--would enter my head? In\nfact,” he concluded with a nervous half-laugh, “there isn't any such\ndifference. Whatever your religion is, it's mine too. You remember--you\nadopted me as a Greek.”\n\n“Did I?” she rejoined. “Well, if that's the case, it leaves you without\na leg to stand on. I challenge you to find any instance where a Greek\nmade any difficulties about accepting a piano from a friend. But\nseriously--while we are talking about it--you introduced the subject:\nI didn't--I might as well explain to you that I had no such intention,\nwhen I picked the instrument out. It was later, when I was talking to\nThurston's people about the price, that the whim seized me. Now it is\nthe one fixed rule of my life to obey my whims. Whatever occurs to me as\na possibly pleasant thing to do, straight like a hash, I go and do it.\nIt is the only way that a person with means, with plenty of money, can\npreserve any freshness of character. If they stop to think what it would\nbe prudent to do, they get crusted over immediately. That is the curse\nof rich people--they teach themselves to distrust and restrain every\nimpulse toward unusual actions. They get to feel that it is more\nnecessary for them to be cautious and conventional than it is for\nothers. I would rather work at a wash-tub than occupy that attitude\ntoward my bank account. I fight against any sign of it that I detect\nrising in my mind. The instant a wish occurs to me, I rush to gratify\nit. That is my theory of life. That accounts for the piano; and I don't\nsee that you've anything to say about it at all.”\n\nIt seemed very convincing, this theory of life. Somehow, the thought\nof Miss Madden's riches had never before assumed prominence in Theron's\nmind. Of course her father was very wealthy, but it had not occurred\nto him that the daughter's emancipation might run to the length of a\npersonal fortune. He knew so little of rich people and their ways!\n\nHe lifted his head, and looked up at Celia with an awakened humility and\nawe in his glance. The glamour of a separate banking-account shone upon\nher. Where the soft woodland light played in among the strands of her\ndisordered hair, he saw the veritable gleam of gold. A mysterious new\nsuggestion of power blended itself with the beauty of her face, was\nexhaled in the faint perfume of her garments. He maintained a timorous\nhold upon the ribbon, wondering at his hardihood in touching it, or\nbeing near her at all.\n\n“What surprises me,” he heard himself saying, “is that you are\ncontented to stay in Octavius. I should think that you would travel--go\nabroad--see the beautiful things of the world, surround yourself with\nthe luxuries of big cities--and that sort of thing.”\n\nCelia regarded the forest prospect straight in front of her with\na pensive gaze. “Sometime--no doubt I will sometime,” she said\nabstractedly.\n\n“One reads so much nowadays,” he went on, “of American heiresses going\nto Europe and marrying dukes and noblemen. I suppose you will do that\ntoo. Princes would fight one another for you.”\n\nThe least touch of a smile softened for an instant the impassivity of\nher countenance. Then she stared harder than ever at the vague, leafy\ndistance. “That is the old-fashioned idea,” she said, in a musing tone,\n“that women must belong to somebody, as if they were curios, or statues,\nor race-horses. You don't understand, my friend, that I have a different\nview. I am myself, and I belong to myself, exactly as much as any man.\nThe notion that any other human being could conceivably obtain the\nslightest property rights in me is as preposterous, as ridiculous,\nas--what shall I say?--as the notion of your being taken out with a\nchain on your neck and sold by auction as a slave, down on the canal\nbridge. I should be ashamed to be alive for another day, if any other\nthought were possible to me.”\n\n“That is not the generally accepted view, I should think,” faltered\nTheron.\n\n“No more is it the accepted view that young married Methodist ministers\nshould sit out alone in the woods with red-headed Irish girls. No, my\nfriend, let us find what the generally accepted views are, and as fast\nas we find them set our heels on them. There is no other way to live\nlike real human beings. What on earth is it to me that other women crawl\nabout on all-fours, and fawn like dogs on any hand that will buckle\na collar onto them, and toss them the leavings of the table? I am not\nrelated to them. I have nothing to do with them. They cannot make any\nrules for me. If pride and dignity and independence are dead in them,\nwhy, so much the worse for them! It is no affair of mine. Certainly it\nis no reason why I should get down and grovel also. No; I at least stand\nerect on my legs.”\n\nMr. Ware sat up, and stared confusedly, with round eyes and parted lips,\nat his companion. Instinctively his brain dragged forth to the surface\nthose epithets which the doctor had hurled in bitter contempt at\nher--“mad ass, a mere bundle of egotism, ignorance, and red-headed\nlewdness.” The words rose in their order on his memory, hard and\nsharp-edged, like arrow-heads. But to sit there, quite at her side; to\nbreathe the same air, and behold the calm loveliness of her profile; to\ntouch the ribbon of her dress--and all the while to hold these poisoned\ndarts of abuse levelled in thought at her breast--it was monstrous. He\ncould have killed the doctor at that moment. With an effort, he drove\nthe foul things from his mind--scattered them back into the darkness.\nHe felt that he had grown pale, and wondered if she had heard the groan\nthat seemed to have been forced from him in the struggle. Or was the\ngroan imaginary?\n\nCelia continued to sit unmoved, composedly looking upon vacancy.\nTheron's eyes searched her face in vain for any sign of consciousness\nthat she had astounded and bewildered him. She did not seem to be\nthinking of him at all. The proud calm of her thoughtful countenance\nsuggested instead occupation with lofty and remote abstractions and\nnoble ideals. Contemplating her, he suddenly perceived that what she had\nbeen saying was great, wonderful, magnificent. An involuntary thrill ran\nthrough his veins at recollection of her words. His fancy likened it to\nthe sensation he used to feel as a youth, when the Fourth of July reader\nbawled forth that opening clause: “When, in the course of human events,\nit becomes necessary,” etc. It was nothing less than another Declaration\nof Independence he had been listening to.\n\nHe sank again recumbent at her side, and stretched the arm behind her,\nnearer than before. “Apparently, then, you will never marry.” His voice\ntrembled a little.\n\n“Most certainly not!” said Celia.\n\n“You spoke so feelingly a little while ago,” he ventured along, with\nhesitation, “about how sadly the notion of a priest's sacrificing\nhimself--never knowing what love meant--appealed to a woman. I should\nthink that the idea of sacrificing herself would seem to her even sadder\nstill.”\n\n“I don't remember that we mentioned THAT,” she replied. “How do you\nmean--sacrificing herself?”\n\nTheron gathered some of the outlying folds of her dress in his hand, and\nboldly patted and caressed them. “You, so beautiful and so free, with\nsuch fine talents and abilities,” he murmured; “you, who could have the\nwhole world at your feet--are you, too, never going to know what love\nmeans? Do you call that no sacrifice? To me it is the most terrible that\nmy imagination can conceive.”\n\nCelia laughed--a gentle, amused little laugh, in which Theron's ears\ntraced elements of tenderness. “You must regulate that imagination of\nyours,” she said playfully. “It conceives the thing that is not. Pray,\nwhen”--and here, turning her head, she bent down upon his face a gaze of\narch mock-seriousness--“pray, when did I describe myself in these terms?\nWhen did I say that I should never know what love meant?”\n\nFor answer Theron laid his head down upon his arm, and closed his\neyes, and held his face against the draperies encircling her. “I cannot\nthink!” he groaned.\n\nThe thing that came uppermost in his mind, as it swayed and rocked in\nthe tempest of emotion, was the strange reminiscence of early childhood\nin it all. It was like being a little boy again, nestling in an\ninnocent, unthinking transport of affection against his mother's skirts.\nThe tears he felt scalding his eyes were the spontaneous, unashamed\ntears of a child; the tremulous and exquisite joy which spread,\nwave-like, over him, at once reposeful and yearning, was full of\ninfantile purity and sweetness. He had not comprehended at all before\nwhat wellsprings of spiritual beauty, what limpid depths of idealism,\nhis nature contained.\n\n“We were speaking of our respective religions,” he heard Celia say, as\nimperturbably as if there had been no digression worth mentioning.\n\n“Yes,” he assented, and moved his head so that he looked up at her back\nhair, and the leaves high above, mottled against the sky. The wish\nto lie there, where now he could just catch the rose-leaf line of her\nunder-chin as well, was very strong upon him. “Yes?” he repeated.\n\n“I cannot talk to you like that,” she said; and he sat up again\nshamefacedly.\n\n“Yes--I think we were speaking of religions--some time ago,” he\nfaltered, to relieve the situation. The dreadful thought that she might\nbe annoyed began to oppress him.\n\n“Well, you said whatever my religion was, it was yours too. That\nentitles you at least to be told what the religion is. Now, I am a\nCatholic.”\n\nTheron, much mystified, nodded his head. Could it be possible--was there\ncoming a deliberate suggestion that he should become a convert? “Yes--I\nknow,” he murmured.\n\n“But I should explain that I am only a Catholic in the sense that its\nsymbolism is pleasant to me. You remember what Schopenhauer said--you\ncannot have the water by itself: you must also have the jug that it is\nin. Very well; the Catholic religion is my jug. I put into it the things\nI like. They were all there long ago, thousands of years ago. The Jews\nthrew them out; we will put them back again. We will restore art and\npoetry and the love of beauty, and the gentle, spiritual, soulful life.\nThe Greeks had it; and Christianity would have had it too, if it hadn't\nbeen for those brutes they call the Fathers. They loved ugliness and\ndirt and the thought of hell-fire. They hated women. In all the earlier\nstages of the Church, women were very prominent in it. Jesus himself\nappreciated women, and delighted to have them about him, and talk with\nthem and listen to them. That was the very essence of the Greek spirit;\nand it breathed into Christianity at its birth a sweetness and a grace\nwhich twenty generations of cranks and savages like Paul and Jerome\nand Tertullian weren't able to extinguish. But the very man, Cyril, who\nkilled Hypatia, and thus began the dark ages, unwittingly did another\nthing which makes one almost forgive him. To please the Egyptians, he\nsecured the Church's acceptance of the adoration of the Virgin. It is\nthat idea which has kept the Greek spirit alive, and grown and grown,\ntill at last it will rule the world. It was only epileptic Jews who\ncould imagine a religion without sex in it.”\n\n“I remember the pictures of the Virgin in your room,” said Theron,\nfeeling more himself again. “I wondered if they quite went with the\nstatues.”\n\nThe remark won a smile from Celia's lips.\n\n“They get along together better than you suppose,” she answered.\n“Besides, they are not all pictures of Mary. One of them, standing on\nthe moon, is of Isis with the infant Horus in her arms. Another might as\nwell be Mahamie, bearing the miraculously born Buddha, or Olympias with\nher child Alexander, or even Perictione holding her babe Plato--all\nthese were similar cases, you know. Almost every religion had its\nImmaculate Conception. What does it all come to, except to show us that\nman turns naturally toward the worship of the maternal idea? That is the\ndeepest of all our instincts--love of woman, who is at once daughter and\nwife and mother. It is that that makes the world go round.”\n\nBrave thoughts shaped themselves in Theron's mind, and shone forth in a\nconfident yet wistful smile on his face.\n\n“It is a pity you cannot change estates with me for one minute,” he\nsaid, in steady, low tone. “Then you would realize the tremendous truth\nof what you have been saying. It is only your intellect that has reached\nout and grasped the idea. If you were in my place, you would discover\nthat your heart was bursting with it as well.”\n\nCelia turned and looked at him.\n\n“I myself,” he went on, “would not have known, half an hour ago, what\nyou meant by the worship of the maternal idea. I am much older than\nyou. I am a strong, mature man. But when I lay down there, and shut my\neyes--because the charm and marvel of this whole experience had for\nthe moment overcome me--the strangest sensation seized upon me. It was\nabsolutely as if I were a boy again, a good, pure-minded, fond little\nchild, and you were the mother that I idolized.”\n\nCelia had not taken her eyes from his face. “I find myself liking you\nbetter at this moment,” she said, with gravity, “than I have ever liked\nyou before.”\n\nThen, as by a sudden impulse, she sprang to her feet. “Come!” she cried,\nher voice and manner all vivacity once more, “we have been here long\nenough.”\n\nUpon the instant, as Theron was more laboriously getting up, it became\napparent to them both that perhaps they had been there too long.\n\nA boy with a gun under his arm, and two gray squirrels tied by the tails\nslung across his shoulder, stood at the entrance to the glade, some\ndozen paces away, regarding them with undisguised interest. Upon the\ndiscovery that he was in turn observed, he resumed his interrupted\nprogress through the woods, whistling softly as he went, and vanished\namong the trees.\n\n“Heavens above!” groaned Theron, shudderingly.\n\n“Know him?” he went on, in answer to the glance of inquiry on his\ncompanion's face. “I should think I did! He spades my--my wife's garden\nfor her. He used to bring our milk. He works in the law office of one\nof my trustees--the one who isn't friendly to me, but is very friendly\nindeed with my--with Mrs. Ware. Oh, what shall I do? It may easily mean\nmy ruin!”\n\nCelia looked at him attentively. The color had gone out of his face, and\nwith it the effect of earnestness and mental elevation which, a minute\nbefore, had caught her fancy. “Somehow, I fear that I do not like you\nquite so much just now, my friend,” she remarked.\n\n“In God's name, don't say that!” urged Theron. He raised his voice in\nagitated entreaty. “You don't know what these people are--how they would\nleap at the barest hint of a scandal about me. In my position I am a\nthousand times more defenceless than any woman. Just a single whisper,\nand I am done for!”\n\n“Let me point out to you, Mr. Ware,” said Celia, slowly, “that to be\nseen sitting and talking with me, whatever doubts it may raise as to\na gentleman's intellectual condition, need not necessarily blast his\nsocial reputation beyond all hope whatever.”\n\nTheron stared at her, as if he had not grasped her meaning. Then he\nwinced visibly under it, and put out his hands to implore her. “Forgive\nme! Forgive me!” he pleaded. “I was beside myself for the moment with\nthe fright of the thing. Oh, say you do forgive me, Celia!” He made\nhaste to support this daring use of her name. “I have been so happy\ntoday--so deeply, so vastly happy--like the little child I spoke of--and\nthat is so new in my lonely life--that--the suddenness of the thing--it\njust for the instant unstrung me. Don't be too hard on me for it! And\nI had hoped, too--I had had such genuine heartfelt pleasure in the\nthought--that, an hour or two ago, when you were unhappy, perhaps it had\nbeen some sort of consolation to you that I was with you.”\n\nCelia was looking away. When he took her hand she did not withdraw it,\nbut turned and nodded in musing general assent to what he had said.\n“Yes, we have both been unstrung, as you call it, today,” she said,\ndecidedly out of pitch. “Let each forgive the other, and say no more\nabout it.”\n\nShe took his arm, and they retraced their steps along the path, again\nin silence. The labored noise of the orchestra, as it were, returned to\nmeet them. They halted at an intersecting footpath.\n\n“I go back to my slavery--my double bondage,” said Theron, letting his\nvoice sink to a sigh. “But even if I am put on the rack for it, I shall\nhave had one day of glory.”\n\n“I think you may kiss me, in memory of that one day--or of a few minutes\nin that day,” said Celia.\n\nTheir lips brushed each other in a swift, almost perfunctory caress.\n\nTheron went his way at a hurried pace, the sobered tones of her\n“good-bye” beating upon his brain with every measure of the droning\nwaltz-music.\n\n\n\n\nPART IV\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nThe memory of the kiss abode with Theron. Like Aaron's rod, it swallowed\nup one by one all competing thoughts and recollections, and made his\nbrain its slave.\n\nEven as he strode back through the woods to the camp-meeting, it was the\nkiss that kept his feet in motion, and guided their automatic course.\nAll along the watches of the restless night, it was the kiss that bore\nhim sweet company, and wandered with him from one broken dream of bliss\nto another. Next day, it was the kiss that made of life for him a sort\nof sunlit wonderland. He preached his sermon in the morning, and took\nhis appointed part in the other services of afternoon and evening,\napparently to everybody's satisfaction: to him it was all a vision.\n\nWhen the beautiful full moon rose, this Sunday evening, and glorified\nthe clearing and the forest with its mellow harvest radiance, he could\nhave groaned with the burden of his joy. He went out alone into the\nlight, and bared his head to it, and stood motionless for a long time.\nIn all his life, he had never been impelled as powerfully toward earnest\nand soulful thanksgiving. The impulse to kneel, there in the pure,\ntender moonlight, and lift up offerings of praise to God, kept uppermost\nin his mind. Some formless resignation restrained him from the act\nitself, but the spirit of it hallowed his mood. He gazed up at the broad\nluminous face of the satellite. “You are our God,” he murmured. “Hers\nand mine! You are the most beautiful of heavenly creatures, as she is of\nthe angels on earth. I am speechless with reverence for you both.”\n\nIt was not until the camp-meeting broke up, four days later, and Theron\nwith the rest returned to town, that the material aspects of what had\nhappened, and might be expected to happen, forced themselves upon his\nmind. The kiss was a child of the forest. So long as Theron remained in\nthe camp, the image of the kiss, which was enshrined in his heart and\nministered to by all his thoughts, continued enveloped in a haze of\nsylvan mystery, like a dryad. Suggestions of its beauty and holiness\ncame to him in the odors of the woodland, at the sight of wild flowers\nand water-lilies. When he walked alone in unfamiliar parts of the\nforest, he carried about with him the half-conscious idea of somewhere\ncoming upon a strange, hidden pool which mortal eye had not seen\nbefore--a deep, sequestered mere of spring-fed waters, walled in by\nrich, tangled growths of verdure, and bearing upon its virgin bosom only\nthe shadows of the primeval wilderness, and the light of the eternal\nskies. His fancy dwelt upon some such nook as the enchanted home of\nthe fairy that possessed his soul. The place, though he never found it,\nbecame real to him. As he pictured it, there rose sometimes from among\nthe lily-pads, stirring the translucent depths and fluttering over the\nwater's surface drops like gems, the wonderful form of a woman, with\npale leaves wreathed in her luxuriant red hair, and a skin which gave\nforth light.\n\nWith the homecoming to Octavius, his dreams began to take more account\nof realities. In a day or two he was wide awake, and thinking hard. The\nkiss was as much as ever the ceaseless companion of his hours, but it no\nlonger insisted upon shrouding itself in vines and woodland creepers, or\noutlining itself in phosphorescent vagueness against mystic backgrounds\nof nymph-haunted glades. It advanced out into the noonday, and assumed\ntangible dimensions and substance. He saw that it was related to the\nfacts of his daily life, and had, in turn, altered his own relations to\nall these facts.\n\nWhat ought he to do? What COULD he do? Apparently, nothing but wait.\nHe waited for a week--then for another week. The conclusion that the\ninitiative had been left to him began to take shape in his mind. From\nthis it seemed but a step to the passionate resolve to act at once.\n\nTurning the situation over and over in his anxious thoughts, two things\nstood out in special prominence. One was that Celia loved him. The other\nwas that the boy in Gorringe's law office, and possibly Gorringe, and\nheaven only knew how many others besides, had reasons for suspecting\nthis to be true.\n\nAnd what about Celia? Side by side with the moving rapture of thinking\nabout her as a woman, there rose the substantial satisfaction of\ncontemplating her as Miss Madden. She had kissed him, and she was very\nrich. The things gradually linked themselves before his eyes. He tried\na thousand varying guesses at what she proposed to do, and each time\nreined up his imagination by the reminder that she was confessedly a\ncreature of whims, who proposed to do nothing, but was capable of all\nthings.\n\nAnd as to the boy. If he had blabbed what he saw, it was incredible that\nsomebody should not take the subject up, and impart a scandalous twist\nto it, and send it rolling like a snowball to gather up exaggeration and\nfoul innuendo till it was big enough to overwhelm him. What would happen\nto him if a formal charge were preferred against him? He looked it up\nin the Discipline. Of course, if his accusers magnified their mean\nsuspicions and calumnious imaginings to the point of formulating a\ncharge, it would be one of immorality. They could prove nothing; there\nwas nothing to prove. At the worst, it was an indiscretion, which would\ninvolve his being admonished by his Presiding Elder. Or if these narrow\nbigots confused slanders with proofs, and showed that they intended to\nconvict him, then it would be open to him to withdraw from the ministry,\nin advance of his condemnation. His relation to the church would be\nthe same as if he had been expelled, but to the outer world it would be\ndifferent. And supposing he did withdraw from the ministry?\n\nYes; this was the important point. What if he did abandon this mistaken\nprofession of his? On its mental side the relief would be prodigious,\nunthinkable. But on the practical side, the bread-and-butter side? For\nsome days Theron paused with a shudder when he reached this question.\nThe thought of the plunge into unknown material responsibilities gave\nhim a sinking heart. He tried to imagine himself lecturing, canvassing\nfor books or insurance policies, writing for newspapers--and remained\nfrightened. But suddenly one day it occurred to him that these qualms\nand forebodings were sheer folly. Was not Celia rich? Would she not with\nlightning swiftness draw forth that check-book, like the flashing sword\nof a champion from its scabbard, and run to his relief? Why, of course.\nIt was absurd not to have thought of that before.\n\nHe recalled her momentary anger with him, that afternoon in the woods,\nwhen he had cried out that discovery would mean ruin to him. He saw\nclearly enough now that she had been grieved at his want of faith in her\nprotection. In his flurry of fright, he had lost sight of the fact that,\nif exposure and trouble came to him, she would naturally feel that she\nhad been the cause of his martyrdom. It was plain enough now. If he got\ninto hot water, it would be solely on account of his having been seen\nwith her. He had walked into the woods with her--“the further the\nbetter” had been her own words--out of pure kindliness, and the\ndesire to lead her away from the scene of her brother's and her own\nhumiliation. But why amplify arguments? Her own warm heart would tell\nher, on the instant, how he had been sacrificed for her sake, and would\nbring her, eager and devoted, to his succor.\n\nThat was all right, then. Slowly, from this point, suggestions expanded\nthemselves. The future could be, if he willed it, one long serene\ntriumph of love, and lofty intellectual companionship, and existence\nsoftened and enriched at every point by all that wealth could command,\nand the most exquisite tastes suggest. Should he will it! Ah! the\nquestion answered itself. But he could not enter upon this beckoning\nheaven of a future until he had freed himself. When Celia said to him,\n“Come!” he must not be in the position to reply, “I should like to, but\nunfortunately I am tied by the leg.” He should have to leave Octavius,\nleave the ministry, leave everything. He could not begin too soon to\nface these contingencies.\n\nVery likely Celia had not thought it out as far as this. With her,\nit was a mere vague “sometime I may.” But the harder masculine sense,\nTheron felt, existed for the very purpose of correcting and giving point\nto these loose feminine notions of time and space. It was for him to\nclear away the obstacles, and map the plans out with definite decision.\n\nOne warm afternoon, as he lolled in his easy-chair under the open\nwindow of his study, musing upon the ever-shifting phases of this vast,\ncomplicated, urgent problem, some chance words from the sidewalk in\nfront came to his ears, and, coming, remained to clarify his thoughts.\n\nTwo ladies whose voices were strange to him had stopped--as so many\npeople almost daily stopped--to admire the garden of the parsonage. One\nof them expressed her pleasure in general terms. Said the other--\n\n“My husband declares those dahlias alone couldn't be matched for thirty\ndollars, and that some of those gladiolus must have cost three or four\ndollars apiece. I know we've spent simply oceans of money on our garden,\nand it doesn't begin to compare with this.”\n\n“It seems like a sinful waste to me,” said her companion.\n\n“No-o,” the other hesitated. “No, I don't think quite that--if you can\nafford it just as well as not. But it does seem to me that I'd rather\nlive in a little better house, and not spend it ALL on flowers. Just\nLOOK at that cactus!”\n\nThe voices died away. Theron sat up, with a look of arrested thought\nupon his face, then sprang to his feet and moved hurriedly through the\nparlor to an open front window. Peering out with caution he saw that the\ntwo women receding from view were fashionably dressed and evidently\ncame from homes of means. He stared after them in a blank way until they\nturned a corner.\n\nHe went into the hall then, put on his frock-coat and hat, and stepped\nout into the garden. He was conscious of having rather avoided it\nheretofore--not altogether without reasons of his own, lying unexamined\nsomewhere in the recesses of his mind. Now he walked slowly about, and\nexamined the flowers with great attentiveness. The season was\nadvancing, and he saw that many plants had gone out of bloom. But what a\nmagnificent plenitude of blossoms still remained!\n\nThirty dollars' worth of dahlias--that was what the stranger had said.\nTheron hardly brought himself to credit the statement; but all the same\nit was apparent to even his uninformed eye that these huge, imbricated,\nflowering masses, with their extraordinary half-colors, must be unusual.\nHe remembered that the boy in Gorringe's office had spoken of just one\nlot of plants costing thirty-one dollars and sixty cents, and there had\nbeen two other lots as well. The figures remained surprisingly distinct\nin his memory. It was no good deceiving himself any longer: of course\nthese were the plants that Gorringe had spent his money upon, here all\nabout him.\n\nAs he surveyed them with a sour regard, a cool breeze stirred across the\ngarden. The tall, over-laden flower-spikes of gladioli bent and nodded\nat him; the hollyhocks and flaming alvias, the clustered blossoms on the\nstandard roses, the delicately painted lilies on their stilt-like stems,\nfluttered in the wind, and seemed all bowing satirically to him. “Yes,\nLevi Gorringe paid for us!” He almost heard their mocking declaration.\n\nOut in the back-yard, where a longer day of sunshine dwelt, there were\nmany other flowers, and notably a bed of geraniums which literally made\nthe eye ache. Standing at this rear corner of the house, he caught the\ndroning sound of Alice's voice, humming a hymn to herself as she went\nabout her kitchen work. He saw her through the open window. She was\nsweeping, and had a sort of cap on her head which did not add to the\ngraces of her appearance. He looked at her with a hard glance, recalling\nas a fresh grievance the ten days of intolerable boredom he had spent\ncooped up in a ridiculous little tent with her, at the camp-meeting. She\nmust have realized at the time how odious the enforced companionship was\nto him. Yes, beyond doubt she did. It came back to him now that they\nhad spoken but rarely to each other. She had not even praised his sermon\nupon the Sabbath-question, which every one else had been in raptures\nover. For that matter she no longer praised anything he did, and took\nobvious pains to preserve toward him a distant demeanor. So much the\nbetter, he felt himself thinking. If she chose to behave in that\noffish and unwifely fashion, she could blame no one but herself for its\nresults.\n\nShe had seen him, and came now to the window, watering-pot and broom\nin hand. She put her head out, to breathe a breath of dustless air, and\nbegan as if she would smile on him. Then her face chilled and stiffened,\nas she caught his look.\n\n“Shall you be home for supper?” she asked, in her iciest tone.\n\nHe had not thought of going out before. The question, and the manner of\nit, gave immediate urgency to the idea of going somewhere. “I may or I\nmay not,” he replied. “It is quite impossible for me to say.” He turned\non his heel with this, and walked briskly out of the yard and down the\nstreet.\n\nIt was the most natural thing that presently he should be strolling past\nthe Madden house, and letting a covert glance stray over its front and\nthe grounds about it, as he loitered along. Every day since his return\nfrom the woods he had given the fates this chance of bringing Celia\nto meet him, without avail. He had hung about in the vicinity of the\nCatholic church on several evenings as well, but to no purpose. The\norgan inside was dumb, and he could detect no signs of Celia's presence\non the curtains of the pastorate next door. This day, too, there was\nno one visible at the home of the Maddens, and he walked on, a little\nsadly. It was weary work waiting for the signal that never came.\n\nBut there were compensations. His mind reverted doggedly to the flowers\nin his garden, and to Alice's behavior toward him. They insisted upon\nconnecting themselves in his thoughts. Why should Levi Gorringe, a\nmoney-lender, and therefore the last man in the world to incur reckless\nexpenditure, go and buy perhaps a hundred dollars, worth of flowers for\nhis wife's garden? It was time--high time--to face this question. And\nhis experiencing religion afterward, just when Alice did, and marching\ndown to the rail to kneel beside her--that was a thing to be thought of,\ntoo.\n\nMeditation, it is true, hardly threw fresh light upon the matter. It\nwas incredible, of course, that there should be anything wrong. To even\nshape a thought of Alice in connection with gallantry would be wholly\nimpossible. Nor could it be said that Gorringe, in his new capacity as a\nprofessing church-member, had disclosed any sign of ulterior motives,\nor of insincerity. Yet there the facts were. While Theron pondered them,\ntheir mystery, if they involved a mystery, baffled him altogether.\nBut when he had finished, he found himself all the same convinced that\nneither Alice nor Gorringe would be free to blame him for anything\nhe might do. He had grounds for complaint against them. If he did not\nhimself know just what these grounds were, it was certain enough that\nTHEY knew. Very well, then, let them take the responsibility for what\nhappened.\n\nIt was indeed awkward that at the moment, as Theron chanced to emerge\ntemporarily from his brown-study, his eyes fell full upon the spare,\nwell-knit form of Levi Gorringe himself, standing only a few feet away,\nin the staircase entrance to his law office. His lean face, browned by\nthe summer's exposure, had a more Arabian aspect than ever. His hands\nwere in his pockets, and he held an unlighted cigar between his teeth.\nHe looked the Rev. Mr. Ware over calmly, and nodded recognition.\n\nTheron had halted instinctively. On the instant he would have given\na great deal not to have stopped at all. It was stupid of him to have\npaused, but it would not do now to go on without words of some sort. He\nmoved over to the door-way, and made a half-hearted pretence of looking\nat the photographs in one of the show-cases at its side. As Mr. Gorringe\ndid not take his hands from his pockets, there was no occasion for any\nformal greeting.\n\n“I had no idea that they took such good pictures in Octavius,” Theron\nremarked after a minute's silence, still bending in examination of the\nphotographs.\n\n“They ought to; they charge New York prices,” observed the lawyer,\nsententiously.\n\nTheron found in the words confirmation of his feeling that Gorringe was\nnot naturally a lavish or extravagant man. Rather was he a careful and\ncalculating man, who spent money only for a purpose. Though the minister\ncontinued gazing at the stiff presentments of local beauties and\nswains, his eyes seemed to see salmon-hued hollyhocks and spotted lilies\ninstead. Suddenly a resolve came to him. He stood erect, and faced his\ntrustee.\n\n“Speaking of the price of things,” he said, with an effort of arrogance\nin his measured tone, “I have never had an opportunity before of\nmentioning the subject of the flowers you have so kindly furnished for\nmy--for MY garden.”\n\n“Why mention it now?” queried Gorringe, with nonchalance. He turned his\ncigar about with a movement of his lips, and worked it into the corner\nof his mouth. He did not find it necessary to look at Theron at all.\n\n“Because--” began Mr. Ware, and then hesitated--“because--well, it\nraises a question of my being under obligation, which I--”\n\n“Oh, no, sir,” said the lawyer; “put that out of your mind. You are no\nmore under obligation to me than I am to you. Oh, no, make yourself easy\nabout that. Neither of us owes the other anything.”\n\n“Not even good-will--I take that to be your meaning,” retorted Theron,\nwith some heat.\n\n“The words are yours, sir,” responded Gorringe, coolly. “I do not object\nto them.”\n\n“As you like,” put in the other. “If it be so, why, then all the more\nreason why I should, under the circumstances--”\n\n“Under what circumstances?” interposed the lawyer. “Let us be clear\nabout this thing as we go along. To what circumstances do you refer?”\n\nHe had turned his eyes now, and looked Theron in the face. A slight\nprotrusion of his lower jaw had given the cigar an upward tilt under the\nblack mustache.\n\n“The circumstances are that you have brought or sent to my garden a\ngreat many very expensive flower-plants and bushes and so on.”\n\n“And you object? I had not supposed that clergymen in general--and you\nin particular--were so sensitive. Have donation parties, then, gone out\nof date?”\n\n“I understand your sneer well enough,” retorted Theron, “but that\ncan pass. The main point is, that you did me the honor to send these\nplants--or to smuggle them in--but never once deigned to hint to me that\nyou had done so. No one told me. Except by mere accident, I should not\nhave known to this day where they came from.”\n\nMr. Gorringe twisted the cigar at another angle, with lines of grim\namusement about the corner of his mouth. “I should have thought,” he\nsaid with dry deliberation, “that possibly this fact might have raised\nin your mind the conceivable hypothesis that the plants might not be\nintended for you at all.”\n\n“That is precisely it, sir,” said Theron. There were people passing, and\nhe was forced to keep his voice down. It would have been a relief, he\nfelt, to shout. “That is it--they were not intended for me.”\n\n“Well, then, what are you talking about?” The lawyer's speech had become\nabrupt almost to incivility.\n\n“I think my remarks have been perfectly clear,” said the minister, with\ndignity. It was a new experience to be addressed in that fashion.\nIt occurred to him to add, “Please remember that I am not in the\nwitness-box, to be bullied or insulted by a professional.”\n\nGorringe studied Theron's face attentively with a cold, searching\nscrutiny. “You may thank your stars you're not!” he said, with\nsignificance.\n\nWhat on earth could he mean? The words and the menacing tone greatly\nimpressed Theron. Indeed, upon reflection, he found that they frightened\nhim. The disposition to adopt a high tone with the lawyer was melting\naway.\n\n“I do not see,” he began, and then deliberately allowed his voice to\ntake on an injured and plaintive inflection--“I do not see why you\nshould adopt this tone toward me--Brother Gorringe.”\n\nThe lawyer scowled, and bit sharply into the cigar, but said nothing.\n\n“If I have unconsciously offended you in any way,” Theron went on, “I\nbeg you to tell me how. I liked you from the beginning of my pastorate\nhere, and the thought that latterly we seemed to be drifting apart has\ngiven me much pain. But now it is still more distressing to find you\nactually disposed to quarrel with me. Surely, Brother Gorringe, between\na pastor and a probationer who--”\n\n“No,” Gorringe broke in; “quarrel isn't the word for it. There isn't any\nquarrel, Mr. Ware.” He stepped down from the door-stone to the sidewalk\nas he spoke, and stood face to face with Theron. Working-men with\ndinner-pails, and factory girls, were passing close to them, and he\nlowered his voice to a sharp, incisive half-whisper as he added, “It\nwouldn't be worth any grown man's while to quarrel with so poor a\ncreature as you are.”\n\nTheron stood confounded, with an empty stare of bewilderment on his\nface. It rose in his mind that the right thing to feel was rage,\nrighteous indignation, fury; but for the life of him, he could not\nmuster any manly anger. The character of the insult stupefied him.\n\n“I do not know that I have anything to say to you in reply,” he\nremarked, after what seemed to him a silence of minutes. His lips\nframed the words automatically, but they expressed well enough the blank\nvacancy of his mind. The suggestion that anybody deemed him a “poor\ncreature” grew more astounding, incomprehensible, as it swelled in his\nbrain.\n\n“No, I suppose not,” snapped Gorringe. “You're not the sort to stand up\nto men; your form is to go round the corner and take it out of somebody\nweaker than yourself--a defenceless woman, for instance.”\n\n“Oh--ho!” said Theron. The exclamation had uttered itself. The sound of\nit seemed to clarify his muddled thoughts; and as they ranged themselves\nin order, he began to understand. “Oh--ho!” he said again, and nodded\nhis head in token of comprehension.\n\nThe lawyer, chewing his cigar with increased activity, glared at him.\n“What do you mean?” he demanded peremptorily.\n\n“Mean?” said the minister. “Oh, nothing that I feel called upon to\nexplain to you.”\n\nIt was passing strange, but his self-possession had all at once returned\nto him. As it became more apparent that the lawyer was losing his\ntemper, Theron found the courage to turn up the corners of his lips in\nshow of a bitter little smile of confidence. He looked into the other's\ndusky face, and flaunted this smile at it in contemptuous defiance. “It\nis not a subject that I can discuss with propriety--at this stage,” he\nadded.\n\n“Damn you! Are you talking about those flowers?”\n\n“Oh, I am not talking about anything in particular,” returned Theron,\n“not even the curious choice of language which my latest probationer\nseems to prefer.”\n\n“Go and strike my name off the list!” said Gorringe, with rising\npassion. “I was a fool to ever have it there. To think of being a\nprobationer of yours--my God!”\n\n“That will be a pity--from one point of view,” remarked Theron, still\nwith the ironical smile on his lips. “You seemed to enter upon the new\nlife with such deliberation and fixity of purpose, too! I can imagine\nthe regrets your withdrawal will cause, in certain quarters. I only hope\nthat it will not discourage those who accompanied you to the altar,\nand shared your enthusiasm at the time.” He had spoken throughout with\nstudied slowness and an insolent nicety of utterance.\n\n“You had better go away!” broke forth Gorringe. “If you don't, I shall\nforget myself.”\n\n“For the first time?” asked Theron. Then, warned by the flash in the\nlawyer's eye, he turned on his heel and sauntered, with a painstaking\nassumption of a mind quite at ease, up the street.\n\nGorringe's own face twitched and his veins tingled as he looked after\nhim. He spat the shapeless cigar out of his mouth into the gutter, and,\ndrawing forth another from his pocket, clenched it between his teeth,\nhis gaze following the tall form of the Methodist minister till it was\nmerged in the crowd.\n\n“Well, I'm damned!” he said aloud to himself.\n\nThe photographer had come down to take in his showcases for the night.\nHe looked up from his task at the exclamation, and grinned inquiringly.\n\n“I've just been talking to a man,” said the lawyer, “who's so much\nmeaner than any other man I ever heard of that it takes my breath away.\nHe's got a wife that's as pure and good as gold, and he knows it, and\nshe worships the ground he walks on, and he knows that too. And yet the\nscoundrel is around trying to sniff out some shadow of a pretext for\nmisusing her worse than he's already done. Yes, sir; he'd be actually\ntickled to death if he could nose up some hint of a scandal about\nher--something that he could pretend to believe, and work for his own\nadvantage to levy blackmail, or get rid of her, or whatever suited his\nbook. I didn't think there was such an out-and-out cur on this whole\nfootstool. I almost wish, by God, I'd thrown him into the canal!”\n\n“Yes, you lawyers must run against some pretty snide specimens,”\n remarked the photographer, lifting one of the cases from its sockets.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nTheron spent half an hour in aimless strolling about the streets. From\nearliest boyhood his mind had always worked most clearly when he walked\nalone. Every mental process which had left a mark upon his memory and\nhis career--the daydreams of future academic greatness and fame which\nhad fashioned themselves in his brain as a farm lad; the meditations,\nraptures, and high resolves of his student period at the seminary; the\nmore notable sermons and powerful discourse by which he had revealed the\ngenius that was in him to astonished and delighted assemblages--all were\nassociated in his retrospective thoughts with solitary rambles.\n\nHe had a very direct and vivid consciousness now that it was good to be\non his legs, and alone. He had never in his life been more sensible of\nthe charm of his own companionship. The encounter with Gorringe seemed\nto have cleared all the clouds out of his brain, and restored lightness\nto his heart. After such an object lesson, the impossibility of his\ncontinuing to sacrifice himself to a notion of duty to these low-minded\nand coarse-natured villagers was beyond all argument. There could no\nlonger be any doubt about his moral right to turn his back upon them, to\nwash his hands of the miserable combination of hypocrisy and hysterics\nwhich they called their spiritual life.\n\nAnd the question of Gorringe and Alice, that too stood precisely where\nhe wanted it. Even in his own thoughts, he preferred to pursue it no\nfurther. Between them somewhere an offence of concealment, it might be\nof conspiracy, had been committed against him. It was no business of his\nto say more, or to think more. He rested his case simply on the fact,\nwhich could not be denied, and which he was not in the least interested\nto have explained, one way or the other. The recollection of Gorringe's\nobvious disturbance of mind was especially pleasant to him. He himself\nhad been magnanimous almost to the point of weakness. He had gone out\nof his way to call the man “brother,” and to give him an opportunity of\nbehaving like a gentleman; but his kindly forbearance had been wasted.\nGorringe was not the man to understand generous feelings, much less rise\nto their level. He had merely shown that he would be vicious if he knew\nhow. It was more important and satisfactory to recall that he had also\nshown a complete comprehension of the injured husband's grievance. The\nfact that he had recognized it was enough--was, in fact, everything.\n\nIn the background of his thoughts Theron had carried along a notion of\ngoing and dining with Father Forbes when the time for the evening meal\nshould arrive. The idea in itself attracted him, as a fitting capstone\nto his resolve not to go home to supper. It gave just the right kind\nof character to his domestic revolt. But when at last he stood on the\ndoorstep of the pastorate, waiting for an answer to the tinkle of the\nelectric bell he had heard ring inside, his mind contained only the\nsingle thought that now he should hear something about Celia. Perhaps he\nmight even find her there; but he put that suggestion aside as slightly\nunpleasant.\n\nThe hag-faced housekeeper led him, as before, into the dining-room. It\nwas still daylight, and he saw on the glance that the priest was alone\nat the table, with a book beside him to read from as he ate.\n\nFather Forbes rose and came forward, greeting his visitor with profuse\nurbanity and smiles. If there was a perfunctory note in the invitation\nto sit down and share the meal, Theron did not catch it. He frankly\ndisplayed his pleasure as he laid aside his hat, and took the chair\nopposite his host.\n\n“It is really only a few months since I was here, in this room, before,”\n he remarked, as the priest closed his book and tossed it to one side,\nand the housekeeper came in to lay another place. “Yet it might have\nbeen years, many long years, so tremendous is the difference that the\nlapse of time has wrought in me.”\n\n“I am afraid we have nothing to tempt you very much, Mr. Ware,” remarked\nFather Forbes, with a gesture of his plump white hand which embraced the\ndishes in the centre of the table. “May I send you a bit of this boiled\nmutton? I have very homely tastes when I am by myself.”\n\n“I was saying,” Theron observed, after some moments had passed in\nsilence, “that I date such a tremendous revolution in my thoughts, my\nbeliefs, my whole mind and character, from my first meeting with you,\nmy first coming here. I don't know how to describe to you the enormous\nchange that has come over me; and I owe it all to you.”\n\n“I can only hope, then, that it is entirely of a satisfactory nature,”\n said the priest, politely smiling.\n\n“Oh, it is so splendidly satisfactory!” said Theron, with fervor. “I\nlook back at myself now with wonder and pity. It seems incredible\nthat, such a little while ago, I should have been such an ignorant\nand unimaginative clod of earth, content with such petty ambitions and\nactually proud of my limitations.”\n\n“And you have larger ambitions now?” asked the other. “Pray let me help\nyou to some potatoes. I am afraid that ambitions only get in our way and\ntrip us up. We clergymen are like street-car horses. The more steadily\nwe jog along between the rails, the better it is for us.”\n\n“Oh, I don't intend to remain in the ministry,” declared Theron. The\nstatement seemed to him a little bald, now that he had made it; and as\nhis companion lifted his brows in surprise, he added stumblingly: “That\nis, as I feel now, it seems to me impossible that I should remain much\nlonger. With you, of course, it is different. You have a thousand things\nto interest and pleasantly occupy you in your work and its ceremonies,\nso that mere belief or non-belief in the dogma hardly matters. But in\nour church dogma is everything. If you take that away, or cease to have\nits support, the rest is intolerable, hideous.”\n\nFather Forbes cut another slice of mutton for himself. “It is a pretty\nserious business to make such a change at your time of life. I take it\nfor granted you will think it all over very carefully before you commit\nyourself.” He said this with an almost indifferent air, which rather\nchilled his listener's enthusiasm.\n\n“Oh, yes,”, Theron made answer; “I shall do nothing rash. But I have a\ngood many plans for the future.”\n\nFather Forbes did not ask what these were, and a brief further period of\nsilence fell upon the table.\n\n“I hope everything went off smoothly at the picnic,” Theron ventured, at\nlast. “I have not seen any of you since then.”\n\nThe priest shook his head and sighed. “No,” he said. “It is a bad\nbusiness. I have had a great deal of unhappiness out of it this past\nfortnight. That young man who was rude to you--of course it was mere\ndrunken, irresponsible nonsense on his part--has got himself into a\nserious scrape, I'm afraid. It is being kept quite within the family,\nand we hope to manage so that it will remain there, but it has terribly\nupset his father and his sister. But that, after all, is not so hard\nto bear as the other affliction that has come upon the Maddens. You\nremember Michael, the other brother? He seems to have taken cold that\nevening, or perhaps over-exerted himself. He has been seized with quick\nconsumption. He will hardly last till snow flies.”\n\n“Oh, I am GRIEVED to hear that!” Theron spoke with tremulous\nearnestness. It seemed to him as if Michael were in some way related to\nhim.\n\n“It is very hard upon them all,” the priest went on. “Michael is as\nsweet and holy a character as it is possible for any one to think of. He\nis the apple of his father's eye. They were inseparable, those two. Do\nyou know the father, Mr. Madden?”\n\nTheron shook his head. “I think I have seen him,” he said. “A small man,\nwith gray whiskers.”\n\n“A peasant,” said Father Forbes, “but with a heart of gold. Poor man! he\nhas had little enough out of his riches. Ah, the West Coast people, what\ntragedies I have seen among them over here! They have rudimentary lung\norganizations, like a frog's, to fit the mild, wet soft air they live\nin. The sharp air here kills them off like flies in a frost. Whole\nfamilies go. I should think there are a dozen of old Jeremiah's children\nin the cemetery. If Michael could have passed his twenty-eighth year,\nthere would have been hope for him, at least till his thirty-fifth.\nThese pulmonary things seem to go by sevens, you know.”\n\n“I didn't know,” said Theron. “It is very strange--and very sad.” His\nstartled mind was busy, all at once, with conjectures as to Celia's age.\n\n“The sister--Miss Madden--seems extremely strong,” he remarked\ntentatively.\n\n“Celia may escape the general doom,” said the priest. His guest noted\nthat he clenched his shapely white hand on the table as he spoke, and\nthat his gentle, carefully modulated voice had a gritty hardness in its\ntone. “THAT would be too dreadful to think of,” he added.\n\nTheron shuddered in silence, and strove to shut his mind against the\nthought.\n\n“She has taken Michael's illness so deeply to heart,” the priest\nproceeded, “and devoted herself to him so untiringly that I get a little\nnervous about her. I have been urging her to go away and get a change of\nair and scene, if only for a few days. She does not sleep well, and that\nis always a bad thing.”\n\n“I think I remember her telling me once that sometimes she had sleepless\nspells,” said Theron. “She said that then she banged on her piano at\nall hours, or dragged the cushions about from room to room, like a wild\nwoman. A very interesting young lady, don't you find her so?”\n\nFather Forbes let a wan smile play on his lips. “What, our Celia?”\n he said. “Interesting! Why, Mr. Ware, there is no one like her in the\nworld. She is as unique as--what shall I say?--as the Irish are among\nraces. Her father and mother were both born in mud-cabins, and she--she\nmight be the daughter of a hundred kings, except that they seem mostly\nrather under-witted than otherwise. She always impresses me as a sort of\natavistic idealization of the old Kelt at his finest and best. There in\nIreland you got a strange mixture of elementary early peoples, walled\noff from the outer world by the four seas, and free to work out their\nown racial amalgam on their own lines. They brought with them at the\noutset a great inheritance of Eastern mysticism. Others lost it, but the\nIrish, all alone on their island, kept it alive and brooded on it, and\nrooted their whole spiritual side in it. Their religion is full of it;\ntheir blood is full of it; our Celia is fuller of it than anybody else.\nThe Ireland of two thousand years ago is incarnated in her. They are the\nmerriest people and the saddest, the most turbulent and the most docile,\nthe most talented and the most unproductive, the most practical and the\nmost visionary, the most devout and the most pagan. These impossible\ncontradictions war ceaselessly in their blood. When I look at Celia,\nI seem to see in my mind's eye the fair young-ancestral mother of them\nall.”\n\nTheron gazed at the speaker with open admiration. “I love to hear you\ntalk,” he said simply.\n\nAn unbidden memory flitted upward in his mind. Those were the very words\nthat Alice had so often on her lips in their old courtship days. How\ncurious it was! He looked at the priest, and had a quaint sensation of\nfeeling as a romantic woman must feel in the presence of a specially\nimpressive masculine personality. It was indeed strange that this\nsoft-voiced, portly creature in a gown, with his white, fat hands and\nhis feline suavity of manner, should produce such a commanding and\nunique effect of virility. No doubt this was a part of the great sex\nmystery which historically surrounded the figure of the celibate priest\nas with an atmosphere. Women had always been prostrating themselves\nbefore it. Theron, watching his companion's full, pallid face in the\nlamp-light, tried to fancy himself in the priest's place, looking down\nupon these worshipping female forms. He wondered what the celibate's\nattitude really was. The enigma fascinated him.\n\nFather Forbes, after his rhetorical outburst, and been eating. He pushed\naside his cheese-plate. “I grow enthusiastic on the subject of my race\nsometimes,” he remarked, with the suggestion of an apology. “But I make\nup for it other times--most of the time--by scolding them. If it were\nnot such a noble thing to be an Irishman, it would be ridiculous.”\n\n“Ah,” said Theron, deprecatingly, “who would not be enthusiastic in\ntalking of Miss Madden? What you said about her was perfect. As you\nspoke, I was thinking how proud and thankful we ought to be for the\nprivilege of knowing her--we who do know her well--although of course\nyour friendship with her is vastly more intimate than mine--than mine\ncould ever hope to be.”\n\nThe priest offered no comment, and Theron went on: “I hardly know how to\ndescribe the remarkable impression she makes upon me. I can't imagine to\nmyself any other young woman so brilliant or broad in her views, or so\ncourageous. Of course, her being so rich makes it easier for her to do\njust what she wants to do, but her bravery is astonishing all the same.\nWe had a long and very sympathetic talk in the woods, that day of the\npicnic, after we left you. I don't know whether she spoke to you about\nit?”\n\nFather Forbes made a movement of the head and eyes which seemed to\nnegative the suggestion.\n\n“Her talk,” continued Theron, “gave me quite new ideas of the range and\ncapacity of the female mind. I wonder that everybody in Octavius isn't\nfull of praise and admiration for her talents and exceptional character.\nIn such a small town as this, you would think she would be the centre of\nattention--the pride of the place.”\n\n“I think she has as much praise as is good for her,” remarked the\npriest, quietly.\n\n“And here's a thing that puzzles me,” pursued Mr. Ware. “I was immensely\nsurprised to find that Dr. Ledsmar doesn't even think she is smart--or\nat least he professes the utmost intellectual contempt for her, and says\nhe dislikes her into the bargain. But of course she dislikes him, too,\nso that's only natural. But I can't understand his denying her great\nability.”\n\nThe priest smiled in a dubious way. “Don't borrow unnecessary alarm\nabout that, Mr. Ware,” he said, with studied smoothness of modulated\ntones. “These two good friends of mine have much enjoyment out of\nthe idea that they are fighting for the mastery over my poor unstable\ncharacter. It has grown to be a habit with them, and a hobby as well,\nand they pursue it with tireless zest. There are not many intellectual\ndiversions open to us here, and they make the most of this one. It\namuses them, and it is not without its charms for me, in my capacity\nas an interested observer. It is a part of the game that they should\npretend to themselves that they detest each other. In reality I fancy\nthat they like each other very much. At any rate, there is nothing to be\ndisturbed about.”\n\nHis mellifluous tones had somehow the effect of suggesting to Theron\nthat he was an outsider and would better mind his own business. Ah, if\nthis purring pussy-cat of a priest only knew how little of an outsider\nhe really was! The thought gave him an easy self-control.\n\n“Of course,” he said, “our warm mutual friendship makes the observation\nof these little individual vagaries merely a part of a delightful whole.\nI should not dream of discussing Miss Madden's confidences to me, or the\ndoctor's either, outside our own little group.”\n\nFather Forbes reached behind him and took from a chair his black\nthree-cornered cap with the tassel. “Unfortunately I have a sick call\nwaiting me,” he said, gathering up his gown and slowly rising.\n\n“Yes, I saw the man sitting in the hall,” remarked Theron, getting to\nhis feet.\n\n“I would ask you to go upstairs and wait,” the priest went on, “but my\nreturn, unhappily, is quite uncertain. Another evening I may be more\nfortunate. I am leaving town tomorrow for some days, but when I get\nback--”\n\nThe polite sentence did not complete itself. Father Forbes had come out\ninto the hall, giving a cool nod to the working-man, who rose from the\nbench as they passed, and shook hands with his guest on the doorstep.\n\nWhen the door had closed upon Mr. Ware, the priest turned to the man.\n“You have come about those frames,” he said. “If you will come upstairs,\nI will show you the prints, and you can give me a notion of what can\nbe done with them. I rather fancy the idea of a triptych in carved old\nEnglish, if you can manage it.”\n\nAfter the workman had gone away, Father Forbes put on slippers and an\nold loose soutane, lighted a cigar, and, pushing an easy-chair over to\nthe reading lamp, sat down with a book. Then something occurred to him,\nand he touched the house-bell at his elbow.\n\n“Maggie,” he said gently, when the housekeeper appeared at the door, “I\nwill have the coffee and FINE CHAMPAGNE up here, if it is no trouble.\nAnd--oh, Maggie--I was compelled this evening to turn the blameless\nvisit of the framemaker into a venial sin, and that involves a needless\nwear and tear of conscience. I think that--hereafter--you understand?--I\nam not invariably at home when the Rev. Mr. Ware does me the honor to\ncall.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nThat night brought the first frost of the season worth counting. In\nthe morning, when Theron came downstairs, his casual glance through\nthe window caught a desolate picture of blackened dahlia stalks and\nshrivelled blooms. The gayety and color of the garden were gone, and in\ntheir place was shabby and dishevelled ruin. He flung the sash up and\nleaned out. The nipping autumn air was good to breathe. He looked about\nhim, surveying the havoc the frost had wrought among the flowers, and\nsmiled.\n\nAt breakfast he smiled again--a mirthless and calculated smile. “I\nsee that Brother Gorringe's flowers have come to grief over night,” he\nremarked.\n\nAlice looked at him before she spoke, and saw on his face a confirmation\nof the hostile hint in his voice. She nodded in a constrained way, and\nsaid nothing.\n\n“Or rather, I should say,” Theron went on, with deliberate words, “the\nlate Brother Gorringe's flowers.”\n\n“How do you mean--LATE” asked his wife, swiftly.\n\n“Oh, calm yourself!” replied the husband. “He is not dead. He has only\nintimated to me his desire to sever his connection. I may add that he\ndid so in a highly offensive manner.”\n\n“I am very sorry,” said Alice, in a low tone, and with her eyes on her\nplate.\n\n“I took it for granted you would be grieved at his backsliding,”\n remarked Theron, making his phrases as pointed as he could. “He was\nsuch a promising probationer, and you took such a keen interest in his\nspiritual awakening. But the frost has nipped his zeal--along with the\nhundred or more dollars' worth of flowers by which he testified his\nfaith. I find something interesting in their having been blasted\nsimultaneously.”\n\nAlice dropped all pretence of interest in her breakfast. With a flushed\nface and lips tightly compressed, she made a movement as if to rise from\nher chair. Then, changing her mind, she sat bolt upright and faced her\nhusband.\n\n“I think we had better have this out right now,” she said, in a voice\nwhich Theron hardly recognized. “You have been hinting round the subject\nlong enough--too long. There are some things nobody is obliged to put\nup with, and this is one of them. You will oblige me by saying out in so\nmany words what it is you are driving at.”\n\nThe outburst astounded Theron. He laid down his knife and fork, and\ngazed at his wife in frank surprise. She had so accustomed him, of late,\nto a demeanor almost abject in its depressed docility that he had quite\nforgotten the Alice of the old days, when she had spirit and courage\nenough for two, and a notable tongue of her own. The flash in her\neyes and the lines of resolution about her mouth and chin for a moment\ndaunted him. Then he observed by a flutter of the frill at her wrist\nthat she was trembling.\n\n“I am sure I have nothing to 'say out in so many words,' as you put\nit,” he replied, forcing his voice into cool, impassive tones. “I merely\ncommented upon a coincidence, that was all. If, for any reason under\nthe sun, the subject chances to be unpleasant to you, I have no earthly\ndesire to pursue it.”\n\n“But I insist upon having it pursued!” returned Alice. “I've had just\nall I can stand of your insinuations and innuendoes, and it's high time\nwe had some plain talk. Ever since the revival, you have been dropping\nsly, underhand hints about Mr. Gorringe and--and me. Now I ask you what\nyou mean by it.”\n\nYes, there was a shake in her voice, and he could see how her bosom\nheaved in a tremor of nervousness. It was easy for him to be very calm.\n\n“It is you who introduce these astonishing suggestions, not I,” he\nreplied coldly. “It is you who couple your name with his--somewhat to my\nsurprise, I admit--but let me suggest that we drop the subject. You\nare excited just now, and you might say things that you would prefer to\nleave unsaid. It would surely be better for all concerned to say no more\nabout it.”\n\nAlice, staring across the table at him with knitted brows, emitted a\nsharp little snort of indignation. “Well, I never! Theron, I wouldn't\nhave thought it of you!”\n\n“There are so many things you wouldn't have thought, on such a variety\nof subjects,” he observed, with a show of resuming his breakfast. “But\nwhy continue? We are only angering each other.”\n\n“Never mind that,” she replied, with more control over her speech. “I\nguess things have come to a pass where a little anger won't do any harm.\nI have a right to insist on knowing what you mean by your insinuations.”\n\nTheron sighed. “Why will you keep harping on the thing?” he asked\nwearily. “I have displayed no curiosity. I don't ask for any\nexplanations. I think I mentioned that the man had behaved insultingly\nto me--but that doesn't matter. I don't bring it up as a grievance. I\nam very well able to take care of myself I have no wish to recur to the\nincident in any way. So far as I am concerned, the topic is dismissed.”\n\n“Listen to me!” broke in Alice, with eager gravity. She hesitated, as he\nlooked up with a nod of attention, and reflected as well as she was able\namong her thoughts for a minute or two. “This is what I want to say to\nyou. Ever since we came to this hateful Octavius, you and I have been\ndrifting apart--or no, that doesn't express it--simply rushing away from\neach other. It only began last spring, and now the space between us\nis so wide that we are worse than complete strangers. For strangers at\nleast don't hate each other, and I've had a good many occasions lately\nto see that you positively do hate me--”\n\n“What grotesque absurdity” interposed Theron, impatiently.\n\n“No, it isn't absurdity; it's gospel truth,” retorted Alice. “And--don't\ninterrupt me--there have been times, too, when I have had to ask myself\nif I wasn't getting almost to hate you in return. I tell you this\nfrankly.”\n\n“Yes, you are undoubtedly frank,” commented the husband, toying with his\nteaspoon. “A hypercritical person might consider, almost too frank.”\n\nAlice scanned his face closely while he spoke, and held her breath as\nif in expectant suspense. Her countenance clouded once more. “You don't\nrealize, Theron,” she said gravely; “your voice when you speak to me,\nyour look, your manner, they have all changed. You are like another\nman--some man who never loved me, and doesn't even know me, much less\nlike me. I want to know what the end of it is to be. Up to the time of\nyour sickness last summer, until after the Soulsbys went away, I didn't\nlet myself get downright discouraged. It seemed too monstrous for\nbelief that you should go away out of my life like that. It didn't seem\npossible that God could allow such a thing. It came to me that I had\nbeen lax in my Christian life, especially in my position as a minister's\nwife, and that this was my punishment. I went to the altar, to intercede\nwith Him, and to try to loose my burden at His feet. But nothing has\ncome of it. I got no help from you.”\n\n“Really, Alice,” broke in Theron, “I explained over and over again to\nyou how preoccupied I was--with the book--and affairs generally.”\n\n“I got no assistance from Heaven either,” she went on, declining the\ndiversion he offered. “I don't want to talk impiously, but if there is a\nGod, he has forgotten me, his poor heart-broken hand-maiden.”\n\n“You are talking impiously, Alice,” observed her husband. “And you are\ndoing me cruel injustice, into the bargain.”\n\n“I only wish I were!” she replied; “I only wish to God I were!”\n\n“Well, then, accept my complete assurance that you ARE--that your whole\nconception of me, and of what you are pleased to describe as my change\ntoward you, is an entire and utter mistake. Of course, the married\nstate is no more exempt from the universal law of growth, development,\nalteration, than any other human institution. On its spiritual side, of\ncourse, viewed either as a sacrament, or as--”\n\n“Don't let us go into that,” interposed Alice, abruptly. “In fact, there\nis no good in talking any more at all. It is as if we didn't speak the\nsame language. You don't understand what I say; it makes no impression\nupon your mind.”\n\n“Quite to the contrary,” he assured her; “I have been deeply interested\nand concerned in all you have said. I think you are laboring under a\ngreat delusion, and I have tried my best to convince you of it; but\nI have never heard you speak more intelligibly or, I might say,\neffectively.”\n\nA little gleam of softness stole over Alice's face. “If you only gave me\na little more credit for intelligence,” she said, “you would find that I\nam not such a blockhead as you think I am.”\n\n“Come, come!” he said, with a smiling show of impatience. “You really\nmustn't impute things to me wholesale, like that.”\n\nShe was glad to answer the smile in kind. “No; but truly,” she pleaded,\n“you don't realize it, but you have grown into a way of treating me as\nif I had absolutely no mind at all.”\n\n“You have a very admirable mind,” he responded, and took up his teaspoon\nagain. She reached for his cup, and poured out hot coffee for him. An\nalmost cheerful spirit had suddenly descended upon the breakfast table.\n\n“And now let me say the thing I have been aching to say for months,” she\nbegan in less burdened voice.\n\nHe lifted his brows. “Haven't things been discussed pretty fully\nalready?” he asked.\n\nThe doubtful, harassed expression clouded upon her face at his\nwords, and she paused. “No,” she said resolutely, after an\ninstant's reflection; “it is my duty to discuss this, too. It is a\nmisunderstanding all round. You remember that I told you Mr. Gorringe\nhad given me some plants, which he got from some garden or other?”\n\n“If you really wish to go on with the subject--yes I have a recollection\nof that particular falsehood of his.”\n\n“He did it with the kindest and friendliest motives in the world!”\n protested Alice. “He saw how down-in-the-mouth and moping I was here,\namong these strangers--and I really was getting quite peaked and\nrun-down--and he said I stayed indoors too much and it would do me all\nsorts of good to work in the garden, and he would send me some plants.\nThe next I knew, here they were, with a book about mixing soils and\nplanting, and so on. When I saw him next, and thanked him, I suppose I\nshowed some apprehension about his having laid out money on them, and\nhe, just to ease my mind, invented the story about his getting them for\nnothing. When I found out the truth--I got it out of that boy, Harvey\nSemple--he admitted it quite frankly--said he was wrong to deceive me.”\n\n“This was in the fine first fervor of his term of probation, I suppose,”\n put in Theron. He made no effort to dissemble the sneer in his voice.\n\n“Well,” answered Alice, with a touch of acerbity, “I have told you\nnow, and it is off my mind. There never would have been the slightest\nconcealment about it, if you hadn't begun by keeping me at arm's length,\nand making it next door to impossible to speak to you at all, and if--”\n\n“And if he hadn't lied.” Theron, as he finished her sentence for her,\nrose from the table. Dallying for a brief moment by his chair, there\nseemed the magnetic premonition in the air of some further and kindlier\nword. Then he turned and walked sedately into the next room, and closed\nthe door behind him. The talk was finished; and Alice, left alone,\npassed the knuckle of her thumb over one swimming eye and then the\nother, and bit her lips and swallowed down the sob that rose in her\nthroat.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nIt was early afternoon when Theron walked out of his yard, bestowing no\nglance upon the withered and tarnished show of the garden, and started\nwith a definite step down the street. The tendency to ruminative\nloitering, which those who saw him abroad always associated with his\ntall, spare figure, was not suggested today. He moved forward like a man\nwith a purpose.\n\nAll the forenoon in the seclusion of the sitting-room, with a book\nopened before him, he had been thinking hard. It was not the talk with\nAlice that occupied his thoughts. That rose in his mind from time to\ntime, only as a disagreeable blur, and he refused to dwell upon it. It\nwas nothing to him, he said to himself, what Gorringe's motives in lying\nhad been. As for Alice, he hardened his heart against her. Just now\nit was her mood to try and make up to him. But it had been something\ndifferent yesterday, and who could say what it would be tomorrow? He\nreally had passed the limit of patience with her shifting emotional\nvagaries, now lurching in this direction, now in that. She had had her\nchance to maintain a hold upon his interest and imagination, and had\nlet it slip. These were the accidents of life, the inevitable harsh\nhappenings in the great tragedy of Nature. They could not be helped, and\nthere was nothing more to be said.\n\nHe had bestowed much more attention upon what the priest had said the\nprevious evening. He passed in review all the glowing tributes Father\nForbes had paid to Celia. They warmed his senses as he recalled them,\nbut they also, in a curious, indefinite way, caused him uneasiness.\nThere had been a personal fervor about them which was something more\nthan priestly. He remembered how the priest had turned pale and faltered\nwhen the question whether Celia would escape the general doom of her\nfamily came up. It was not a merely pastoral agitation that, he felt\nsure.\n\nA hundred obscure hints, doubts, stray little suspicions, crowded upward\ntogether in his thoughts. It became apparent to him now that from the\noutset he had been conscious of something queer--yes, from that very\nfirst day when he saw the priest and Celia together, and noted their\nglance of recognition inside the house of death. He realized now, upon\nreflection, that the tone of other people, his own parishioners and his\ncasual acquaintances in Octavius alike, had always had a certain note of\nreservation in it when it touched upon Miss Madden. Her running in and\nout of the pastorate at all hours, the way the priest patted her on\nthe shoulder before others, the obvious dislike the priest's ugly old\nhousekeeper bore her, the astonishing freedom of their talk with each\nother--these dark memories loomed forth out of a mass of sinister\nconjecture.\n\nHe could bear the uncertainty no longer. Was it indeed not entirely his\nown fault that it had existed thus long? No man with the spirit of a\nmouse would have shilly-shallied in this preposterous fashion, week\nafter week, with the fever of a beautiful woman's kiss in his blood, and\nthe woman herself living only round the corner. The whole world had been\nas good as offered to him--a bewildering world of wealth and beauty and\nspiritual exaltation and love--and he, like a weak fool, had waited for\nit to be brought to him on a salver, as it were, and actually forced\nupon his acceptance! “That is my failing,” he reflected; “these\nmiserable ecclesiastical bandages of mine have dwarfed my manly side.\nThe meanest of Thurston's clerks would have shown a more adventurous\nspirit and a bolder nerve. If I do not act at once, with courage and\nresolution, everything will be lost. Already she must think me unworthy\nof the honor it was in her sweet will to bestow.” Then he remembered\nthat she was now always at home. “Not another hour of foolish\nindecision!” he whispered to himself. “I will put my destiny to the\ntest. I will see her today!”\n\nA middle-aged, plain-faced servant answered his ring at the door-bell\nof the Madden mansion. She was palpably Irish, and looked at him with a\nsaddened preoccupation in her gray eyes, holding the door only a little\najar.\n\nTheron had got out one of his cards. “I wish to make inquiry about\nyoung Mr. Madden--Mr. Michael Madden,” he said, holding the card forth\ntentatively. “I have only just heard of his illness, and it has been a\ngreat grief to me.”\n\n“He is no better,” answered the woman, briefly.\n\n“I am the Rev. Mr. Ware,” he went on, “and you may say that, if he is\nwell enough, I should be glad to see him.”\n\nThe servant peered out at him with a suddenly altered expression, then\nshook her head. “I don't think he would be wishing to see YOU,” she\nreplied. It was evident from her tone that she suspected the visitor's\nintentions.\n\nTheron smiled in spite of himself. “I have not come as a clergyman,” he\nexplained, “but as a friend of the family. If you will tell Miss Madden\nthat I am here, it will do just as well. Yes, we won't bother him. If\nyou will kindly hand my card to his sister.”\n\nWhen the domestic turned at this and went in, Theron felt like throwing\nhis hat in the air, there where he stood. The woman's churlish sectarian\nprejudices had played ideally into his hands. In no other imaginable way\ncould he have asked for Celia so naturally. He wondered a little that a\nservant at such a grand house as this should leave callers standing on\nthe doorstep. Still more he wondered what he should say to the lady of\nhis dream when he came into her presence.\n\n“Will you please to walk this way?” The woman had returned. She closed\nthe door noiselessly behind him, and led the way, not up the sumptuous\nstaircase, as Theron had expected, but along through the broad hall,\npast several large doors, to a small curtained archway at the end.\nShe pushed aside this curtain, and Theron found himself in a sort of\nconservatory, full of the hot, vague light of sunshine falling through\nground-glass. The air was moist and close, and heavy with the smell of\nverdure and wet earth. A tall bank of palms, with ferns sprawling at\ntheir base, reared itself directly in front of him. The floor was of\nmosaic, and he saw now that there were rugs upon it, and that there were\nchairs and sofas, and other signs of habitation. It was, indeed, only\nhalf a greenhouse, for the lower part of it was in rosewood panels, with\nfloral paintings on them, like a room.\n\nMoving to one side of the barrier of palms, he discovered, to his great\nsurprise, the figure of Michael, sitting propped up with pillows in\na huge easy-chair. The sick man was looking at him with big, gravely\nintent eyes. His face did not show as much change as Theron had in fancy\npictured. It had seemed almost as bony and cadaverous on the day of the\npicnic. The hands spread out on the chair-arms were very white and\nthin, though, and the gaze in the blue eyes had a spectral quality which\ndisturbed him.\n\nMichael raised his right hand, and Theron, stepping forward, took it\nlimply in his for an instant. Then he laid it down again. The touch of\npeople about to die had always been repugnant to him. He could feel on\nhis own warm palm the very damp of the grave.\n\n“I only heard from Father Forbes last evening of your--your ill-health,”\n he said, somewhat hesitatingly. He seated himself on a bench beneath\nthe palms, facing the invalid, but still holding his hat. “I hope very\nsincerely that you will soon be all right again.”\n\n“My sister is lying down in her room,” answered Michael. He had not once\ntaken his sombre and embarrassing gaze from the other's face. The voice\nin which he uttered this uncalled-for remark was thin in fibre, cold\nand impassive. It fell upon Theron's ears with a suggestion of hidden\nmeaning. He looked uneasily into Michael's eyes, and then away again.\nThey seemed to be looking straight through him, and there was no\nshirking the sensation that they saw and comprehended things with an\nunnatural prescience.\n\n“I hope she is feeling better,” Theron found himself saying. “Father\nForbes mentioned that she was a little under the weather. I dined with\nhim last night.”\n\n“I am glad that you came,” said Michael, after a little pause. His\nearnest, unblinking eyes seemed to supplement his tongue with speech of\ntheir own. “I do be thinking a great deal about you. I have matters to\nspeak of to you, now that you are here.”\n\nTheron bowed his head gently, in token of grateful attention. He tried\nthe experiment of looking away from Michael, but his glance went back\nagain irresistibly, and fastened itself upon the sick man's gaze, and\nclung there.\n\n“I am next door to a dead man,” he went on, paying no heed to the\nother's deprecatory gesture. “It is not years or months with me, but\nweeks. Then I go away to stand up for judgment on my sins, and if it is\nHis merciful will, I shall see God. So I say my good-byes now, and so\nyou will let me speak plainly, and not think ill of what I say. You\nare much changed, Mr. Ware, since you came to Octavius, and it is not a\nchange for the good.”\n\nTheron lifted his brows in unaffected surprise, and put inquiry into his\nglance.\n\n“I don't know if Protestants will be saved, in God's good time, or not,”\n continued Michael. “I find there are different opinions among the clergy\nabout that, and of course it is not for me, only a plain mechanic, to be\nsure where learned and pious scholars are in doubt. But I am sure about\none thing. Those Protestants, and others too, mind you, who profess\nand preach good deeds, and themselves do bad deeds--they will never be\nsaved. They will have no chance at all to escape hell-fire.”\n\n“I think we are all agreed upon that, Mr. Madden,” said Theron, with\nsurface suavity.\n\n“Then I say to you, Mr. Ware, you are yourself in a bad path. Take the\nwarning of a dying man, sir, and turn from it!”\n\nThe impulse to smile tugged at Theron's facial muscles. This was\nreally too droll. He looked up at the ceiling, the while he forced his\ncountenance into a polite composure, then turned again to Michael, with\nsome conciliatory commonplace ready for utterance. But he said nothing,\nand all suggestion of levity left his mind, under the searching\ninspection bent upon him by the young man's hollow eyes. What did\nMichael suspect? What did he know? What was he hinting at, in this\nstrange talk of his?\n\n“I saw you often on the street when first you came here,” continued\nMichael. “I knew the man who was here before you--that is, by sight--and\nhe was not a good man. But your face, when you came, pleased me. I liked\nto look at you. I was tormented just then, do you see, that so many\ndecent, kindly people, old school-mates and friends and neighbors of\nmine--and, for that matter, others all over the country must lose their\nsouls because they were Protestants. At my boyhood and young manhood,\nthat thought took the joy out of me. Sometimes I usen't to sleep a whole\nnight long, for thinking that some lad I had been playing with, perhaps\nin his own house, that very day, would be taken when he died, and his\nmother too, when she died, and thrown into the flames of hell for\nall eternity. It made me so unhappy that finally I wouldn't go to any\nProtestant boy's house, and have his mother be nice to me, and give me\ncake and apples--and me thinking all the while that they were bound to\nbe damned, no matter how good they were to me.”\n\nThe primitive humanity of this touched Theron, and he nodded approbation\nwith a tender smile in his eyes, forgetting for the moment that a\npersonal application of the monologue had been hinted at.\n\n“But then later, as I grew up,” the sick man went on, “I learned that it\nwas not altogether certain. Some of the authorities, I found, maintained\nthat it was doubtful, and some said openly that there must be salvation\npossible for good people who lived in ignorance of the truth through no\nfault of their own. Then I had hope one day, and no hope the next, and\nas I did my work I thought it over, and in the evenings my father and\nI talked it over, and we settled nothing of it at all. Of course, how\ncould we?”\n\n“Did you ever discuss the question with your sister?” it occurred\nsuddenly to Theron to interpose. He was conscious of some daring in\ndoing so, and he fancied that Michael's drawn face clouded a little at\nhis words.\n\n“My sister is no theologian,” he answered briefly. “Women have no call\nto meddle with such matters. But I was saying--it was in the middle of\nthese doubtings of mine that you came here to Octavius, and I noticed\nyou on the streets, and once in the evening--I made no secret of it to\nmy people--I sat in the back of your church and heard you preach. As I\nsay, I liked you. It was your face, and what I thought it showed of the\nman underneath it, that helped settle my mind more than anything else. I\nsaid to myself: 'Here is a young man, only about my own age, and he has\neducation and talents, and he does not seek to make money for himself,\nor a great name, but he is content to live humbly on the salary of a\nbook-keeper, and devote all his time to prayer and the meditation of\nhis religion, and preaching, and visiting the sick and the poor, and\ncomforting them. His very face is a pleasure and a help for those in\nsuffering and trouble to look at. The very sight of it makes one believe\nin pure thoughts and merciful deeds. I will not credit it that God\nintends damning such a man as that, or any like him!'”\n\nTheron bowed, with a slow, hesitating gravity of manner, and deep, not\nwholly complacent, attention on his face. Evidently all this was by way\nof preparation for something unpleasant.\n\n“That was only last spring,” said Michael. His tired voice sank for\na sentence or two into a meditative half-whisper. “And it was MY last\nspring of all. I shall not be growing weak any more, or drawing hard\nbreaths, when the first warm weather comes. It will be one season to\nme hereafter, always the same.” He lifted his voice with perceptible\neffort. “I am talking too much. The rest I can say in a word. Only half\na year has gone by, and you have another face on you entirely. I had\nnoticed the small changes before, one by one. I saw the great change,\nall of a sudden, the day of the picnic. I see it a hundred times more\nnow, as you sit there. If it seemed to me like the face of a saint\nbefore, it is more like the face of a bar-keeper now!”\n\nThis was quite too much. Theron rose, flushed to the temples, and\nscowled down at the helpless man in the chair. He swallowed the sharp\nwords which came uppermost, and bit and moistened his lips as he forced\nhimself to remember that this was a dying man, and Celia's brother, to\nwhom she was devoted, and whom he himself felt he wanted to be very fond\nof. He got the shadow of a smile on to his countenance.\n\n“I fear you HAVE tired yourself unduly,” he said, in as non-contentious\na tone as he could manage. He even contrived a little deprecatory laugh.\n“I am afraid your real quarrel is with the air of Octavius. It agrees\nwith me so wonderfully--I am getting as fat as a seal. But I do hope I\nam not paying for it by such a wholesale deterioration inside. If my own\nopinion could be of any value, I should assure you that I feel myself\nan infinitely better and broader and stronger man than I was when I came\nhere.”\n\nMichael shook his head dogmatically. “That is the greatest pity of all,”\n he said, with renewed earnestness. “You are entirely deceived about\nyourself. You do not at all realize how you have altered your direction,\nor where you are going. It was a great misfortune for you, sir, that\nyou did not keep among your own people. That poor half-brother of mine,\nthough the drink was in him when he said that same to you, never spoke\na truer word. Keep among your own people, Mr. Ware! When you go among\nothers--you know what I mean--you have no proper understanding of what\ntheir sayings and doings really mean. You do not realize that they are\nheld up by the power of the true Church, as a little child learning to\nwalk is held up with a belt by its nurse. They can say and do things,\nand no harm at all come to them, which would mean destruction to you,\nbecause they have help, and you are walking alone. And so be said by me,\nMr. Ware! Go back to the way you were brought up in, and leave alone the\npeople whose ways are different from yours. You are a married man, and\nyou are the preacher of a religion, such as it is. There can be nothing\nbetter for you than to go and strive to be a good husband, and to set a\ngood example to the people of your Church, who look up to you--and mix\nyourself up no more with outside people and outside notions that only do\nyou mischief. And that is what I wanted to say to you.”\n\nTheron took up his hat. “I take in all kindness what you have felt it\nyour duty to say to me, Mr. Madden,” he said. “I am not sure that I have\naltogether followed you, but I am very sure you mean it well.”\n\n“I mean well by you,” replied Michael, wearily moving his head on the\npillow, and speaking in an undertone of languor and pain, “and I mean\nwell by others, that are nearer to me, and that I have a right to care\nmore about. When a man lies by the site of his open grave, he does not\nbe meaning ill to any human soul.”\n\n“Yes--thanks--quite so!” faltered Theron. He dallied for an instant\nwith the temptation to seek some further explanation, but the sight of\nMichael's half-closed eyes and worn-out expression decided him against\nit. It did not seem to be expected, either, that he should shake hands,\nand with a few perfunctory words of hope for the invalid's recovery,\nwhich fell with a jarring note of falsehood upon his own ears, he turned\nand left the room. As he did so, Michael touched a bell on the table\nbeside him.\n\nTheron drew a long breath in the hall, as the curtain fell behind him.\nIt was an immense relief to escape from the oppressive humidity and heat\nof the flower-room, and from that ridiculous bore of a Michael as well.\n\nThe middle-aged, grave-faced servant, warned by the bell, stood waiting\nto conduct him to the door.\n\n“I am sorry to have missed Miss Madden,” he said to her. “She must be\nquite worn out. Perhaps later in the day--”\n\n“She will not be seeing anybody today,” returned the woman. “She is\ngoing to New York this evening, and she is taking some rest against the\njourney.”\n\n“Will she be away long?” he asked mechanically. The servant's answer, “I\nhave no idea,” hardly penetrated his consciousness at all.\n\nHe moved down the steps, and along the gravel to the street, in a maze\nof mental confusion. When he reached the sidewalk, under the familiar\nelms, he paused, and made a definite effort to pull his thoughts\ntogether, and take stock of what had happened, of what was going to\nhappen; but the thing baffled him. It was as if some drug had stupefied\nhis faculties.\n\nHe began to walk, and gradually saw that what he was thinking about was\nthe fact of Celia's departure for New York that evening. He stared\nat this fact, at first in its nakedness, then clothed with reassuring\nsuggestions that this was no doubt a trip she very often made. There was\na blind sense of comfort in this idea, and he rested himself upon it.\nYes, of course, she travelled a great deal. New York must be as familiar\nto her as Octavius was to him. Her going there now was quite a matter of\ncourse--the most natural thing in the world.\n\nThen there burst suddenly uppermost in his mind the other fact--that\nFather Forbes was also going to New York that evening. The two things\nspindled upward, side by side, yet separately, in his mental vision;\nthen they twisted and twined themselves together. He followed their\nconvolutions miserably, walking as if his eyes were shut.\n\nIn slow fashion matters defined and arranged themselves before him.\nThe process of tracing their sequence was all torture, but there was no\npossibility, no notion, of shirking any detail of the pain. The priest\nhad spoken of his efforts to persuade Celia to go away for a few days,\nfor rest and change of air and scene. He must have known only too well\nthat she was going, but of that he had been careful to drop no hint. The\npossibility of accident was too slight to be worth considering. People\non such intimate terms as Celia and the priest--people with such\nfacilities for seeing each other whenever they desired--did not find\nthemselves on the same train of cars, with the same long journey in\nview, by mere chance.\n\nTheron walked until dusk began to close in upon the autumn day. It grew\ncolder, as he turned his face homeward. He wondered if it would freeze\nagain over-night, and then remembered the shrivelled flowers in his\nwife's garden. For a moment they shaped themselves in a picture before\nhis mind's eye; he saw their blackened foliage, their sicklied, drooping\nstalks, and wilted blooms, and as he looked, they restored themselves to\nthe vigor and grace and richness of color of summer-time, as vividly as\nif they had been painted on a canvas. Or no, the picture he stared at\nwas not on canvas, but on the glossy, varnished panel of a luxurious\nsleeping-car. He shook his head angrily and blinked his eyes again and\nagain, to prevent their seeing, seated together in the open window above\nthis panel, the two people he knew were there, gloved and habited for\nthe night's journey, waiting for the train to start.\n\n\n\n“Very much to my surprise,” he found himself saying to Alice, watching\nher nervously as she laid the supper-table, “I find I must go to Albany\ntonight. That is, it isn't absolutely necessary, for that matter, but\nI think it may easily turn out to be greatly to my advantage to go.\nSomething has arisen--I can't speak about it as yet--but the sooner I\nsee the Bishop about it the better. Things like that occur in a man's\nlife, where boldly striking out a line of action, and following it up\nwithout an instant's delay, may make all the difference in the world\nto him. Tomorrow it might be too late; and, besides, I can be home the\nsooner again.”\n\nAlice's face showed surprise, but no trace of suspicion. She spoke with\nstudied amiability during the meal, and deferred with such unexpected\ntact to his implied desire not to be questioned as to the mysterious\nmotives of the journey, that his mood instinctively softened and warmed\ntoward her, as they finished supper.\n\nHe smiled a little. “I do hope I shan't have to go on tomorrow to New\nYork; but these Bishops of ours are such gad-abouts one never knows\nwhere to catch them. As like as not Sanderson may be down in New York,\non Book-Concern business or something; and if he is, I shall have to\nchase him up. But, after all, perhaps the trip will do me good--the\nchange of air and scene, you know.”\n\n“I'm sure I hope so,” said Alice, honestly enough. “If you do go on to\nNew York, I suppose you'll go by the river-boat. Everybody talks so much\nof that beautiful sail down the Hudson.”\n\n“That's an idea!” exclaimed Theron, welcoming it with enthusiasm. “It\nhadn't occurred to me. If I do have to go, and it is as lovely as they\nmake out, the next time I promise I won't go without you, my girl. I\nHAVE been rather out of sorts lately,” he continued. “When I come back,\nI daresay I shall be feeling better, more like my old self. Then I'm\ngoing to try, Alice, to be nicer to you than I have been of late. I'm\nafraid there was only too much truth in what you said this morning.”\n\n“Never mind what I said this morning--or any other time,” broke in\nAlice, softly. “Don't ever remember it again, Theron, if only--only--”\n\nHe rose as she spoke, moved round the table to where she sat, and,\nbending over her, stopped the faltering sentence with a kiss. When was\nit, he wondered, that he had last kissed her? It seemed years, ages,\nago.\n\nAn hour later, with hat and overcoat on, and his valise in his hand, he\nstood on the doorstep of the parsonage, and kissed her once more before\nhe turned and descended into the darkness. He felt like whistling as his\nfeet sounded firmly on the plank sidewalk beyond the gate. It seemed as\nif he had never been in such capital good spirits before in his life.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nThe train was at a standstill somewhere, and the dull, ashen beginnings\nof daylight had made a first feeble start toward effacing the lamps in\nthe car-roof, when the new day opened for Theron. A man who had just\ncome in stopped at the seat upon which he had been stretched through the\nnight, and, tapping him brusquely on the knee, said, “I'm afraid I must\ntrouble you, sir.” After a moment of sleep-burdened confusion, he sat\nup, and the man took the other half of the seat and opened a newspaper,\nstill damp from the press. It was morning, then.\n\nTheron rubbed a clear space upon the clouded window with his thumb, and\nlooked out. There was nothing to be seen but a broad stretch of tracks,\nand beyond this the shadowed outlines of wagons and machinery in a yard,\nwith a background of factory buildings.\n\nThe atmosphere in the car was vile beyond belief. He thought of opening\nthe window, but feared that the peremptory-looking man with the paper,\nwho had wakened him and made him sit up, might object. They were the\nonly people in the car who were sitting up. Backwards and forwards,\non either side of the narrow aisle, the dim light disclosed recumbent\nforms, curled uncomfortably into corners, or sprawling at difficult\nangles which involved the least interference with one another. Here and\nthere an upturned face gave a livid patch of surface for the mingled\nplay of the gray dawn and the yellow lamp-light. A ceaseless noise of\nsnoring was in the air.\n\nHe got up and walked to the tank of ice-water at the end of the aisle,\nand took a drink from the most inaccessible portion of the common\ntin-cup's rim. The happy idea of going out on the platform struck him,\nand he acted upon it. The morning air was deliciously cool and fresh\nby contrast, and he filled his lungs with it again and again. Standing\nhere, he could discern beyond the buildings to the right the faint\npurplish outlines of great rounded hills. Some workmen, one of them\nbearing a torch, were crouching along under the side of the train,\npounding upon the resonant wheels with small hammers. He recalled having\nheard the same sound in the watches of the night, during a prolonged\nhalt. Some one had said it was Albany. He smiled in spite of himself at\nthe thought that Bishop Sanderson would never know about the visit he\nhad missed.\n\nSwinging himself to the ground, he bent sidewise and looked forward down\nthe long train. There were five, six, perhaps more, sleeping-cars on\nin front. Which one of them, he wondered--and then there came the sharp\n“All aboard!” from the other side, and he bundled up the steps again,\nand entered the car as the train slowly resumed its progress.\n\nHe was wide-awake now, and quite at his ease. He took his seat, and\ndiverted himself by winking gravely at a little child facing him on the\nnext seat but one. There were four other children in the family party,\nencamped about the tired and still sleeping mother whose back was turned\nto Theron. He recalled now having noticed this poor woman last night,\nin the first stage of his journey--how she fed her brood from one of the\nnumerous baskets piled under their feet, and brought water in a tin dish\nof her own from the tank to use in washing their faces with a rag, and\nloosened their clothes to dispose them for the night's sleep. The face\nof the woman, her manner and slatternly aspect, and the general effect\nof her belongings, bespoke squalid ignorance and poverty. Watching her,\nTheron had felt curiously interested in the performance. In one sense,\nit was scarcely more human than the spectacle of a cat licking her\nkittens, or a cow giving suck to her calf. Yet, in another, was there\nanything more human?\n\nThe child who had wakened before the rest regarded him with placidity,\ndeclining to be amused by his winkings, but exhibiting no other emotion.\nShe had been playing by herself with a couple of buttons tied on\na string, and after giving a civil amount of attention to Theron's\ngrimaces, she turned again to the superior attractions of this toy. Her\nself-possession, her capacity for self-entertainment, the care she took\nnot to arouse the others, all impressed him very much. He felt in his\npocket for a small coin, and, reaching forward, offered it to her. She\ntook it calmly, bestowed a tranquil gaze upon him for a moment, and went\nback to the buttons. Her indifference produced an unpleasant sensation\nupon him somehow, and he rubbed the steaming window clear again, and\nstared out of it.\n\nThe wide river lay before him, flanked by a precipitous wall of\ncliffs which he knew instantly must be the Palisades. There was an\nadvertisement painted on them which he tried in vain to read. He was\nsurprised to find they interested him so slightly. He had heard all his\nlife of the Hudson, and especially of it just at this point. The reality\nseemed to him almost commonplace. His failure to be thrilled depressed\nhim for the moment.\n\n“I suppose those ARE the Palisades?” he asked his neighbor.\n\nThe man glanced up from his paper, nodded, and made as if to resume his\nreading. But his eye had caught something in the prospect through the\nwindow which arrested his attention. “By George!” he exclaimed, and\nlifted himself to get a clearer view.\n\n“What is it?” asked Theron, peering forth as well.\n\n“Nothing; only Barclay Wendover's yacht is still there. There's been a\nhitch of some sort. They were to have left yesterday.”\n\n“Is that it--that long black thing?” queried Theron. “That can't be a\nyacht, can it?”\n\n“What do you think it is?” answered the other. They were looking at a\nslim, narrow hull, lying at anchor, silent and motionless on the drab\nexpanse of water. “If that ain't a yacht, they haven't begun building\nany yet. They're taking her over to the Mediterranean for a cruise, you\nknow--around India and Japan for the winter, and home by the South Sea\nislands. Friend o' mine's in the party. Wouldn't mind the trip myself.”\n\n“But do you mean to say,” asked Theron, “that that little shell of a\nthing can sail across the ocean? Why, how many people would she hold?”\n\nThe man laughed. “Well,” he said, “there's room for two sets of\nquadrilles in the chief saloon, if the rest keep their legs well up on\nthe sofas. But there's only ten or a dozen in the party this time.\nMore than that rather get in one another's way, especially with so many\nladies on board.”\n\nTheron asked no more questions, but bent his head to see the last of\nthis wonderful craft. The sight of it, and what he had heard about it,\nsuddenly gave point and focus to his thoughts. He knew at last what it\nwas that had lurked, formless and undesignated, these many days in the\nbackground of his dreams. The picture rose in his mind now of Celia as\nthe mistress of a yacht. He could see her reclining in a low easy-chair\nupon the polished deck, with the big white sails billowing behind her,\nand the sun shining upon the deep blue waves, and glistening through the\nsplash of spray in the air, and weaving a halo of glowing gold about\nher fair head. Ah, how the tender visions crowded now upon him! Eternal\nsummer basked round this enchanted yacht of his fancy--summer sought\nnow in Scottish firths or Norwegian fiords, now in quaint old Southern\nharbors, ablaze with the hues of strange costumes and half-tropical\nflowers and fruits, now in far-away Oriental bays and lagoons, or among\nthe coral reefs and palm-trees of the luxurious Pacific. He dwelt upon\nthese new imaginings with the fervent longing of an inland-born boy.\nEvery vague yearning he had ever felt toward salt-water stirred again in\nhis blood at the thought of the sea--with Celia.\n\nWhy not? She had never visited any foreign land. “Sometime,” she had\nsaid, “sometime, no doubt I will.” He could hear again the wistful,\nmusing tone of her voice. The thought had fascinations for her, it was\nclear. How irresistibly would it not appeal to her, presented with the\nadded charm of a roving, vagrant independence on the high seas, free\nto speed in her snow-winged chariot wherever she willed over the deep,\nloitering in this place, or up-helm-and-away to another, with no more\ncare or weight of responsibility than the gulls tossing through the air\nin her wake!\n\nTheron felt, rather than phrased to himself, that there would not be\n“ten or a dozen in the party” on that yacht. Without defining anything\nin his mind, he breathed in fancy the same bold ocean breeze which\nfilled the sails, and toyed with Celia's hair; he looked with her as she\nsat by the rail, and saw the same waves racing past, the same vast dome\nof cloud and ether that were mirrored in her brown eyes, and there was\nno one else anywhere near them. Even the men in sailors' clothes,\nwho would be pulling at ropes, or climbing up tarred ladders, kept\nthemselves considerately outside the picture. Only Celia sat there, and\nat her feet, gazing up again into her face as in the forest, the man\nwhose whole being had been consecrated to her service, her worship, by\nthe kiss.\n\n“You've passed it now. I was trying to point out the Jumel house to\nyou--where Aaron Burr lived, you know.”\n\nTheron roused himself from his day-dream, and nodded with a confused\nsmile at his neighbor. “Thanks,” he faltered; “I didn't hear you. The\ntrain makes such a noise, and I must have been dozing.”\n\nHe looked about him. The night aspect, as of a tramps' lodging-house,\nhad quite disappeared from the car. Everybody was sitting up; and the\nmore impatient were beginning to collect their bundles and hand-bags\nfrom the racks and floor. An expressman came through, jangling a huge\nbunch of brass checks on leathern thongs over his arm, and held parley\nwith passengers along the aisle. Outside, citified streets, with stores\nand factories, were alternating in the moving panorama with open fields;\nand, even as he looked, these vacant spaces ceased altogether, and\nsuccessive regular lines of pavement, between two tall rows of houses\nall alike, began to stretch out, wheel to the right, and swing off out\nof view, for all the world like the avenues of hop-poles he remembered\nas a boy. Then was a long tunnel, its darkness broken at stated\nintervals by brief bursts of daylight from overhead, and out of this all\nat once the train drew up its full length in some vast, vaguely lighted\nenclosure, and stopped.\n\n“Yes, this is New York,” said the man, folding up his paper, and\nspringing to his feet. The narrow aisle was filled with many others who\nhad been prompter still; and Theron stood, bag in hand, waiting till\nthis energetic throng should have pushed itself bodily past him forth\nfrom the car. Then he himself made his way out, drifting with a sense of\nhelplessness in their resolute wake. There rose in his mind the sudden\nconviction that he would be too late. All the passengers in the forward\nsleepers would be gone before he could get there. Yet even this terror\ngave him no new power to get ahead of anybody else in the tightly packed\nthrong.\n\nOnce on the broad platform, the others started off briskly; they all\nseemed to know just where they wanted to go, and to feel that no instant\nof time was to be lost in getting there. Theron himself caught some of\nthis urgent spirit, and hurled himself along in the throng with reckless\nhaste, knocking his bag against peoples' legs, but never pausing for\napology or comment until he found himself abreast of the locomotive at\nthe head of the train. He drew aside from the main current here, and\nbegan searching the platform, far and near, for those he had travelled\nso far to find.\n\nThe platform emptied itself. Theron lingered on in puzzled hesitation,\nand looked about him. In the whole immense station, with its acres of\ntracks and footways, and its incessantly shifting processions of people,\nthere was visible nobody else who seemed also in doubt, or who appeared\ncapable of sympathizing with indecision in any form. Another train came\nin, some way over to the right, and before it had fairly stopped,\nswarms of eager men began boiling out of each end of each car, literally\nprecipitating themselves over one another, it seemed to Theron, in their\nexcited dash down the steps. As they caught their footing below, they\nstarted racing pell-mell down the platform to its end; there he saw\nthem, looking more than ever like clustered bees in the distance,\nstruggling vehemently in a dense mass up a staircase in the remote\ncorner of the building.\n\n“What are those folks running for? Is there a fire?” he asked an\namiable-faced young mulatto, in the uniform of the sleeping-car service,\nwho passed him with some light hand-bags.\n\n“No; they's Harlem people, I guess--jes' catchin' the Elevated--that's\nall, sir,” he answered obligingly.\n\nAt the moment some passengers emerged slowly from one of the\nsleeping-cars, and came loitering toward him.\n\n“Why, are there people still in these cars?” he asked eagerly. “Haven't\nthey all gone?”\n\n“Some has; some ain't,” the porter replied. “They most generally take\ntheir time about it. They ain't no hurry, so long's they get out 'fore\nwe're drawn round to the drill-yard.”\n\nThere was still hope, then. Theron took up his bag and walked forward,\nintent upon finding some place from which he could watch unobserved the\nbelated stragglers issuing from the sleeping-cars. He started back\nall at once, confronted by a semi-circle of violent men with whips\nand badges, who stunned his hearing by a sudden vociferous outburst of\nshouts and yells. They made furious gestures at him with their whips\nand fists, to enforce the incoherent babel of their voices; and in these\ngestures, as in their faces and cries, there seemed a great deal of\nmenace and very little invitation. There was a big policeman sauntering\nnear by, and Theron got the idea that it was his presence alone which\nprotected him from open violence at the hands of these savage hackmen.\nHe tightened his clutch on his valise, and, turning his back on them\nand their uproar, tried to brave it out and stand where he was. But the\npoliceman came lounging slowly toward him, with such authority in his\nswaying gait, and such urban omniscience written all over his broad,\nsandy face, that he lost heart, and beat an abrupt retreat off to the\nright, where there were a number of doorways, near which other people\nhad ventured to put down baggage on the floor.\n\nHere, somewhat screened from observation, he stood for a long time,\nwatching at odd moments the ceaselessly varying phases of the strange\nscene about him, but always keeping an eye on the train he had himself\narrived in. It was slow and dispiriting work. A dozen times his heart\nfailed him, and he said to himself mournfully that he had had his\njourney for nothing. Then some new figure would appear, alighting from\nthe steps of a sleeper, and hope revived in his breast.\n\nAt last, when over half an hour of expectancy had been marked off by the\nbig clock overhead, his suspense came to an end. He saw Father Forbes'\nerect and substantial form, standing on the car platform nearest of\nall, balancing himself with his white hands on the rails, waiting for\nsomething. Then after a little he came down, followed by a black porter,\nwhose arms were burdened by numerous bags and parcels. The two stood\na minute or so more in hesitation at the side of the steps. Then Celia\ndescended, and the three advanced.\n\nThe importance of not being discovered was uppermost in Theron's mind,\nnow that he saw them actually coming toward him. He had avoided this the\nprevious evening, in the Octavius depot, with some skill, he flattered\nhimself. It gave him a pleasurable sense of being a man of affairs,\nalmost a detective, to be confronted by the necessity now of baffling\nobservation once again. He was still rather without plans for keeping\nthem in view, once they left the station. He had supposed that he would\nbe able to hear what hotel they directed their driver to take them to,\nand, failing that, he had fostered a notion, based upon a story he had\nread when a boy, of throwing himself into another carriage, and bidding\nhis driver to pursue them in hot haste, and on his life not fail to\ntrack them down. These devices seemed somewhat empty, now that the\nurgent moment was at hand; and as he drew back behind some other\nloiterers, out of view, he sharply racked his wits for some way of\ncoping with this most pressing problem.\n\nIt turned out, however, that there was no difficulty at all. Father\nForbes and Celia seemed to have no use for the hackmen, but moved\nstraight forward toward the street, through the doorway next to that\nin which Theron cowered. He stole round, and followed them at a safe\ndistance, making Celia's hat, and the portmanteau perched on the\nshoulder of the porter behind her, his guides. To his surprise, they\nstill kept on their course when they had reached the sidewalk, and went\nover the pavement across an open square which spread itself directly\nin front of the station. Hanging as far behind as he dared, he saw them\npass to the other sidewalk diagonally opposite, proceed for a block or\nso along this, and then separate at a corner. Celia and the negro lad\nwent down a side street, and entered the door of a vast, tall red-brick\nbuilding which occupied the whole block. The priest, turning on his\nheel, came back again and went boldly up the broad steps of the front\nentrance to this same structure, which Theron now discovered to be the\nMurray Hill Hotel.\n\nFortune had indeed favored him. He not only knew where they were, but he\nhad been himself a witness to the furtive way in which they entered\nthe house by different doors. Nothing in his own limited experience of\nhotels helped him to comprehend the notion of a separate entrance\nfor ladies and their luggage. He did not feel quite sure about the\nsignificance of what he had observed, in his own mind. But it was\napparent to him that there was something underhanded about it.\n\nAfter lingering awhile on the steps of the hotel, and satisfying himself\nby peeps through the glass doors that the coast was clear, he ventured\ninside. The great corridor contained many people, coming, going, or\nstanding about, but none of them paid any attention to him. At last\nhe made up his mind, and beckoned a colored boy to him from a group\ngathered in the shadows of the big central staircase. Explaining that\nhe did not at that moment wish a room, but desired to leave his bag, the\nboy took him to a cloak-room, and got him a check for the thing. With\nthis in his pocket he felt himself more at his ease, and turned to walk\naway. Then suddenly he wheeled, and, bending his body over the counter\nof the cloak-room, astonished the attendant inside by the eagerness with\nwhich he scrutinized the piled rows of portmanteaus, trunks, overcoats,\nand bundles in the little enclosure.\n\n“What is it you want? Here's your bag, if you're looking for that,” this\nman said to him.\n\n“No, thanks; it's nothing,” replied Theron, straightening himself again.\nHe had had a narrow escape. Father Forbes and Celia, walking side by\nside, had come down the small passage in which he stood, and had passed\nhim so closely that he had felt her dress brush against him. Fortunately\nhe had seen them in time, and by throwing himself half into the\ncloak-room, had rendered recognition impossible.\n\nHe walked now in the direction they had taken, till he came to the\npolite colored man at an open door on the left, who was bowing people\ninto the breakfast room. Standing in the doorway, he looked about him\ntill his eye lighted upon his two friends, seated at a small table by\na distant window, with a black waiter, card in hand, bending over in\nconsultation with them.\n\nReturning to the corridor, he made bold now to march up to the desk and\nexamine the register. The priest's name was not there. He found only the\nbrief entry, “Miss Madden, Octavius,” written, not by her, but by Father\nForbes. On the line were two numbers in pencil, with an “and” between\nthem. An indirect question to one of the clerks helped him to an\nexplanation of this. When there were two numbers, it meant that the\nguest in question had a parlor as well as a bedroom.\n\nHere he drew a long, satisfied breath, and turned away. The first half\nof his quest stood completed--and that much more fully and easily than\nhe had dared to hope. He could not but feel a certain new respect for\nhimself as a man of resource and energy. He had demonstrated that people\ncould not fool with him with impunity.\n\nIt remained to decide what he would do with his discovery, now that\nit had been so satisfactorily made. As yet, he had given this hardly a\nthought. Even now, it did not thrust itself forward as a thing demanding\ninstant attention. It was much more important, first of all, to get a\ngood breakfast. He had learned that there was another and less formal\neating-place, downstairs in the basement by the bar, with an entrance\nfrom the street. He walked down by the inner stairway instead, feeling\nhimself already at home in the big hotel. He ordered an ample breakfast,\nand came out while it was being served to wash and have his boots\nblacked, and he gave the man a quarter of a dollar. His pockets were\nfilled with silver quarters, half-dollars, and dollars almost to a\nburdensome point, and in his valise was a bag full of smaller change,\nincluding many rolls of copper cents which Alice always counted and\npacked up on Mondays. In the hurry of leaving he had brought with him\nthe church collections for the past two weeks. It occurred to him that\nhe must keep a strict account of his expenditure. Meanwhile he gave ten\ncents to another man in a silk-sleeved cardigan jacket, who had merely\nstood by and looked at him while his boots were being polished. There\nwas a sense of metropolitan affluence in the very atmosphere.\n\nThe little table in the adjoining room, on which Theron found his meal\nin waiting for him, seemed a vision of delicate napery and refined\nappointments in his eyes. He was wolfishly hungry, and the dishes he\nlooked upon gave him back assurances by sight and smell that he was very\nhappy as well. The servant in attendance had an extremely white apron\nand a kindly black face. He bowed when Theron looked at him, with the\nair of a lifelong admirer and humble friend.\n\n“I suppose you'll have claret with your breakfast, sir?” he remarked, as\nif it were a matter of course.\n\n“Why, certainly,” answered Theron, stretching his legs contentedly\nunder the table, and tucking the corner of his napkin in his\nneckband.--“Certainly, my good man.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nAt ten o'clock Theron, loitering near the bookstall in the corridor, saw\nFather Forbes come downstairs, pass out through the big front doors, get\ninto a carriage, and drive away.\n\nThis relieved him of a certain sense of responsibility, and he retired\nto a corner sofa and sat down. The detective side of him being off duty,\nso to speak, there was leisure at last for reflection upon the other\naspects of his mission. Yes; it was high time for him to consider what\nhe should do next.\n\nIt was easier to recognize this fact, however, than to act upon it.\nHis mind was full of tricksy devices for eluding this task of serious\nthought which he sought to impose upon it. It seemed so much pleasanter\nnot to think at all--but just to drift. He found himself watching with\nenvy the men who, as they came out from their breakfast, walked over to\nthe bookstall, and bought cigars from the row of boxes nestling there\namong the newspaper piles. They had such evident delight in the work\nof selection; they took off the ends of the cigars so carefully, and\nlighted them with such meditative attention,--he could see that he was\nwofully handicapped by not knowing how to smoke. He had had the most\nwonderful breakfast of his life, but even in the consciousness of\ncomfortable repletion which pervaded his being, there was an obstinate\nsense of something lacking. No doubt a good cigar was the thing needed\nto round out the perfection of such a breakfast. He half rose once,\nfired by a sudden resolution to go over and get one. But of course that\nwas nonsense; it would only make him sick. He sat down, and determinedly\nset himself to thinking.\n\nThe effort finally brought fruit--and of a kind which gave him a very\nunhappy quarter of an hour. The lover part of him was uppermost now,\ninsistently exposing all its raw surfaces to the stings and scalds of\njealousy. Up to this moment, his brain had always evaded the direct\nquestion of how he and the priest relatively stood in Celia's\nestimation. It forced itself remorselessly upon him now; and his\nthoughts, so far from shirking the subject, seemed to rise up to meet\nit. It was extremely unpleasant, all this.\n\nBut then a calmer view asserted itself. Why go out of his way to\ninvent anguish for himself? The relations between Celia and the priest,\nwhatever they might be, were certainly of old standing. They had begun\nbefore his time. His own romance was a more recent affair, and must take\nits place, of course, subject to existing conditions.\n\nIt was all right for him to come to New York, and satisfy his legitimate\ncuriosity as to the exact character and scope of these conditions. But\nit was foolish to pretend to be amazed or dismayed at the discovery of\ntheir existence. They were a part of the situation which he, with his\neyes wide open, had accepted. It was his function to triumph over them,\nto supplant them, to rear the edifice of his own victorious passion upon\ntheir ruins. It was to this that Celia's kiss had invited him. It was\nfor this that he had come to New York. To let his purpose be hampered or\nthwarted now by childish doubts and jealousies would be ridiculous.\n\nHe rose, and holding himself very erect, walked with measured\ndeliberation across the corridor and up the broad staircase. There was\nan elevator near at hand, he had noticed, but he preferred the stairs.\nOne or two of the colored boys clustered about the foot of the stairs\nlooked at him, and he had a moment of dreadful apprehension lest they\nshould stop his progress. Nothing was said, and he went on. The numbers\non the first floor were not what he wanted, and after some wandering\nabout he ascended to the next, and then to the third. Every now and then\nhe encountered attendants, but intuitively he bore himself with an air\nof knowing what he was about which protected him from inquiry.\n\nFinally he came upon the hall-way he sought. Passing along, he found\nthe doors bearing the numbers he had memorized so well. They were quite\nclose together, and there was nothing to help him guess which belonged\nto the parlor. He hesitated, gazing wistfully from one to the other. In\nthe instant of indecision, even while his alert ear caught the sound of\nfeet coming along toward the passage in which he stood, a thought came\nto quicken his resolve. It became apparent to him that his discovery\ngave him a certain new measure of freedom with Celia, a sort of right to\ntake things more for granted than heretofore. He chose a door at random,\nand rapped distinctly on the panel.\n\n“Come!”\n\nThe voice he knew for Celia's. The single word, however, recalled\nthe usage of Father Forbes, which he had noted more than once at the\npastorate, when Maggie had knocked.\n\nHe straightened his shoulders, took his hat off, and pushed open the\ndoor. It WAS the parlor--a room of sofas, pianos, big easy-chairs, and\nluxurious bric-a-brac. A tall woman was walking up and down in it, with\nbowed head. Her back was at the moment toward him; and he looked at her,\nsaying to himself that this was the lady of his dreams, the enchantress\nof the kiss, the woman who loved him--but somehow it did not seem to his\nsenses to be Celia.\n\nShe turned, and moved a step or two in his direction before she\nmechanically lifted her eyes and saw who was standing in her doorway.\nShe stopped short, and regarded him. Her face was in the shadow, and he\ncould make out nothing of its expression, save that there was a general\neffect of gravity about it.\n\n“I cannot receive you,” she said. “You must go away. You have no\nbusiness to come like this without sending up your card.”\n\nTheron smiled at her. The notion of taking in earnest her inhospitable\nwords did not at all occur to him. He could see now that her face had\nvexed and saddened lines upon it, and the sharpness of her tone remained\nin his ears. But he smiled again gently, to reassure her.\n\n“I ought to have sent up my name, I know,” he said, “but I couldn't bear\nto wait. I just saw your name on the register and--you WILL forgive me,\nwon't you?--I ran to you at once. I know you won't have the heart to\nsend me away!”\n\nShe stood where she had halted, her arms behind her, looking him fixedly\nin the face. He had made a movement to advance, and offer his hand in\ngreeting, but her posture checked the impulse. His courage began to\nfalter under her inspection.\n\n“Must I really go down again?” he pleaded. “It's a crushing penalty to\nsuffer for such little indiscretion. I was so excited to find you were\nhere--I never stopped to think. Don't send me away; please don't!”\n\nCelia raised her head. “Well, shut the door, then,” she said, “since you\nare so anxious to stay. You would have done much better, though, very\nmuch better indeed, to have taken the hint and gone away.”\n\n“Will you shake hands with me, Celia?” he asked softly, as he came near\nher.\n\n“Sit there, please!” she made answer, indicating a chair in the middle\nof the room. He obeyed her, but to his surprise, instead of seating\nherself as well, she began walking up and down the length of the floor\nagain. After a turn or two she stopped in front of him, and looked him\nfull in the eye. The light from the windows was on her countenance now,\nand its revelations vaguely troubled him. It was a Celia he had never\nseen before who confronted him.\n\n“I am much occupied by other matters,” she said, speaking with cold\nimpassivity, “but still I find myself curious to know just what limits\nyou set to your dishonesty.”\n\nTheron stared up at her. His lips quivered, but no speech came to them.\nIf this was all merely fond playfulness, it was being carried to a\nheart-aching point.\n\n“I saw you hiding about in the depot at home last evening,” she went on.\n“You come up here, pretending to have discovered me by accident, but I\nsaw you following me from the Grand Central this morning.”\n\n“Yes, I did both these things,” said Theron, boldly. A fine bravery\ntingled in his veins all at once. He looked into her face and found the\nspirit to disregard its frowning aspect. “Yes, I did them,” he repeated\ndefiantly. “That is not the hundredth part, or the thousandth part,\nof what I would do for your sake. I have got way beyond caring for any\nconsequences. Position, reputation, the good opinion of fools--what are\nthey? Life itself--what does it amount to? Nothing at all--with you in\nthe balance!”\n\n“Yes--but I am not in the balance,” observed Celia, quietly. “That is\nwhere you have made your mistake.”\n\nTheron laid aside his hat. Women were curious creatures, he reflected.\nSome were susceptible to one line of treatment, some to another. His own\nreading of Celia had always been that she liked opposition, of a smart,\nrattling, almost cheeky, sort. One got on best with her by saying bright\nthings. He searched his brain now for some clever quip that would strike\nsparks from the adamantine mood which for the moment it was her whim to\nassume. To cover the process, he smiled a little. Then her beauty,\nas she stood before him, her queenly form clad in a more stiffly\nfashionable dress than he had seen her wearing before, appealed afresh\nand overwhelmingly to him. He rose to his feet.\n\n“Have you forgotten our talk in the woods?” he murmured with a wooing\nnote. “Have you forgotten the kiss?”\n\nShe shook her head calmly. “I have forgotten nothing.”\n\n“Then why play with me so cruelly now?” he went on, in a voice of tender\ndeprecation. “I know you don't mean it, but all the same it bruises my\nheart a little. I build myself so wholly upon you, I have made existence\nitself depend so completely upon your smile, upon a soft glance in your\neyes, that when they are not there, why, I suffer, I don't know how to\nlive at all. So be kinder to me, Celia!”\n\n“I was kinder, as you call it, when you came in,” she replied. “I\ntold you to go away. That was pure kindness--more kindness than you\ndeserved.”\n\nTheron looked at his hat, where it stood on the carpet by his feet. He\nfelt tears coming into his eyes. “You tell me that you remember,” he\nsaid, in depressed tones, “and yet you treat me like this! Perhaps I am\nwrong. No doubt it is my own fault. I suppose I ought not to have come\ndown here at all.”\n\nCelia nodded her head in assent to this view.\n\n“But I swear that I was helpless in the matter,” he burst forth. “I HAD\nto come! It would have been literally impossible for me to have stayed\nat home, knowing that you were here, and knowing also that--that--”\n\n“Go on!” said Celia, thrusting forth her under-lip a trifle, and\nhardening still further the gleam in her eye, as he stumbled over his\nsentence and left it unfinished. “What was the other thing that you were\n'knowing'?”\n\n“Knowing--” he took up the word hesitatingly--“knowing that life would\nbe insupportable to me if I could not be near you.”\n\nShe curled her lip at him. “You skated over the thin spot very well,”\n she commented. “It was on the tip of your tongue to mention the fact\nthat Father Forbes came with me. Oh, I can read you through and through,\nMr. Ware.”\n\nIn a misty way Theron felt things slipping from his grasp. The rising\nmoisture blurred his eyes as their gaze clung to Celia.\n\n“Then if you do read me,” he protested, “you must know how utterly my\nheart and brain are filled with you. No other man in all the world can\nyield himself so absolutely to the woman he worships as I can. You have\ntaken possession of me so wholly, I am not in the least master of myself\nany more. I don't know what I say or what I do. I am not worthy of you,\nI know. No man alive could be that. But no one else will idolize and\nreverence you as I do. Believe me when I say that, Celia! And how can\nyou blame me, in your heart, for following you? 'Whither thou goest,\nI will go, and where thou lodgest I will lodge; thy people shall be my\npeople, and thy God my God; where thou diest, will I die, and there will\nI be buried. The Lord do so to me, and more also, if aught but death\npart thee and me!'”\n\nCelia shrugged her shoulders, and moved a few steps away from him.\nSomething like despair seized upon him.\n\n“Surely,” he urged with passion, “surely I have a right to remind you of\nthe kiss!”\n\nShe turned. “The kiss,” she said meditatively. “Yes, you have a right\nto remind me of it. Oh, yes, an undoubted right. You have another right\ntoo--the right to have the kiss explained to you. It was of the good-bye\norder. It signified that we weren't to meet again, and that just for one\nlittle moment I permitted myself to be sorry for you. That was all.”\n\nHe held himself erect under the incredible words, and gazed blankly at\nher. The magnitude of what he confronted bewildered him; his mind was\nincapable of taking it in. “You mean--” he started to say, and then\nstopped, helplessly staring into her face, with a dropped jaw. It was\ntoo much to try to think what she meant.\n\nA little side-thought sprouted in the confusion of his brain. It grew\nuntil it spread a bitter smile over his pale face. “I know so little\nabout kisses,” he said; “I am such a greenhorn at that sort of thing.\nYou should have had pity on my inexperience, and told me just what brand\nof kiss it was I was getting. Probably I ought to have been able to\ndistinguish, but you see I was brought up in the country--on a farm.\nThey don't have kisses in assorted varieties there.”\n\nShe bowed her head slightly. “Yes, you are entitled to say that,” she\nassented. “I was to blame, and it is quite fair that you should tell\nme so. You spoke of your inexperience, your innocence. That was why I\nkissed you in saying good-bye. It was in memory of that innocence of\nyours, to which you yourself had been busy saying good-bye ever since I\nfirst saw you. The idea seemed to me to mean something at the moment. I\nsee now that it was too subtle. I do not usually err on that side.”\n\nTheron kept his hold upon her gaze, as if it afforded him bodily\nsupport. He felt that he ought to stoop and take up his hat, but he\ndared not look away from her. “Do you not err now, on the side of\ncruelty?” he asked her piteously.\n\nIt seemed for the instant as if she were wavering, and he swiftly thrust\nforth other pleas. “I admit that I did wrong to follow you to New York.\nI see that now. But it was an offence committed in entire good faith.\nThink of it, Celia! I have never seen you since that day--that day in\nthe woods. I have waited--and waited--with no sign from you, no chance\nof seeing you at all. Think what that meant to me! Everything in the\nworld had been altered for me, torn up by the roots. I was a new being,\nplunged into a new existence. The kiss had done that. But until saw you\nagain, I could not tell whether this vast change in me and my life was\nfor good or for bad--whether the kiss had come to me as a blessing or a\ncurse. The suspense was killing me, Celia! That is why, when I learned\nthat you were coming here, I threw everything to the winds and followed\nyou. You blame me for it, and I bow my head and accept the blame. But\nare you justified in punishing me so terribly--in going on after I have\nconfessed my error, and cutting my heart into little strips, putting me\nto death by torture?”\n\n“Sit down,” said Celia, with a softened weariness in her voice. She\nseated herself in front of him as he sank into his chair again. “I don't\nwant to give you unnecessary pain, but you have insisted on forcing\nyourself into a position where there isn't anything else but pain. I\nwarned you to go away, but you wouldn't. No matter how gently I may try\nto explain things to you, you are bound to get nothing but suffering out\nof the explanation. Now shall I still go on?”\n\nHe inclined his head in token of assent, and did not lift it again, but\nraised toward her a disconsolate gaze from a pallid, drooping face.\n\n“It is all in a single word, Mr. Ware,” she proceeded, in low tones.\n“I speak for others as well as myself, mind you--we find that you are a\nbore.”\n\nTheron's stiffened countenance remained immovable. He continued to stare\nunblinkingly up into her eyes.\n\n“We were disposed to like you very much when we first knew you,”\n Celia went on. “You impressed us as an innocent, simple, genuine young\ncharacter, full of mother's milk. It was like the smell of early spring\nin the country to come in contact with you. Your honesty of nature,\nyour sincerity in that absurd religion of yours, your general NAIVETE of\nmental and spiritual get-up, all pleased us a great deal. We thought you\nwere going to be a real acquisition.”\n\n“Just a moment--whom do you mean by 'we'?” He asked the question calmly\nenough, but in a voice with an effect of distance in it.\n\n“It may not be necessary to enter into that,” she replied. “Let me go\non. But then it became apparent, little by little, that we had misjudged\nyou. We liked you, as I have said, because you were unsophisticated and\ndelightfully fresh and natural. Somehow we took it for granted you would\nstay so. Rut that is just what you didn't do--just what you hadn't the\nsense to try to do. Instead, we found you inflating yourself with\nall sorts of egotisms and vanities. We found you presuming upon the\nfriendships which had been mistakenly extended to you. Do you want\ninstances? You went to Dr. Ledsmar's house that very day after I had\nbeen with you to get a piano at Thurston's, and tried to inveigle him\ninto talking scandal about me. You came to me with tales about him. You\nwent to Father Forbes, and sought to get him to gossip about us both.\nNeither of those men will ever ask you inside his house again. But that\nis only one part of it. Your whole mind became an unpleasant thing\nto contemplate. You thought it would amuse and impress us to hear you\nridiculing and reviling the people of your church, whose money supports\nyou, and making a mock of the things they believe in, and which you for\nyour life wouldn't dare let them know you didn't believe in. You talked\nto us slightingly about your wife. What were you thinking of, not\nto comprehend that that would disgust us? You showed me once--do you\nremember?--a life of George Sand that you had just bought,--bought\nbecause you had just discovered that she had an unclean side to her\nlife. You chuckled as you spoke to me about it, and you were for all the\nworld like a little nasty boy, giggling over something dirty that older\npeople had learned not to notice. These are merely random incidents.\nThey are just samples, picked hap-hazard, of the things in you which\nhave been opening our eyes, little by little, to our mistake. I\ncan understand that all the while you really fancied that you were\nexpanding, growing, in all directions. What you took to be improvement\nwas degeneration. When you thought that you were impressing us most by\nyour smart sayings and doings, you were reminding us most of the fable\nabout the donkey trying to play lap-dog. And it wasn't even an honest,\nstraightforward donkey at that!”\n\nShe uttered these last words sorrowfully, her hands clasped in her lap,\nand her eyes sinking to the floor. A silence ensued. Then Theron reached\na groping hand out for his hat, and, rising, walked with a lifeless,\nautomatic step to the door.\n\nHe had it half open, when the impossibility of leaving in this way\ntowered suddenly in his path and overwhelmed him. He slammed the door\nto, and turned as if he had been whirled round by some mighty wind.\nHe came toward her, with something almost menacing in the vigor of his\nmovements, and in the wild look upon his white, set face. Halting\nbefore her, he covered the tailor-clad figure, the coiled red hair, the\nupturned face with its simulated calm, the big brown eyes, the rings\nupon the clasped fingers, with a sweeping, comprehensive glare of\npassion.\n\n“This is what you have done to me, then!”\n\nHis voice was unrecognizable in his own ears--hoarse and broken, but\nwith a fright-compelling something in it which stimulated his rage. The\nhorrible notion of killing her, there where she sat, spread over the\nchaos of his mind with an effect of unearthly light--red and abnormally\nevil. It was like that first devilish radiance ushering in Creation, of\nwhich the first-fruit was Cain. Why should he not kill her? In all ages,\nwomen had been slain for less. Yes--and men had been hanged. Something\nrose and stuck in his dry throat; and as he swallowed it down, the\nsinister flare of murderous fascination died suddenly away into\ndarkness. The world was all black again--plunged in the Egyptian night\nwhich lay upon the face of the deep while the earth was yet without form\nand void. He was alone on it--alone among awful, planetary solitudes\nwhich crushed him.\n\nThe sight of Celia, sitting motionless only a pace in front of him, was\nplain enough to his eyes. It was an illusion. She was really a star,\nmany millions of miles away. These things were hard to understand; but\nthey were true, none the less. People seemed to be about him, but in\nfact he was alone. He recalled that even the little child in the car,\nplaying with those two buttons on a string, would have nothing to do\nwith him. Take his money, yes; take all he would give her--but not smile\nat him, not come within reach of him! Men closed the doors of their\nhouses against him. The universe held him at arm's length as a nuisance.\n\nHe was standing with one knee upon a sofa. Unconsciously he had moved\nround to the side of Celia; and as he caught the effect of her face now\nin profile, memory-pictures began at once building themselves in his\nbrain--pictures of her standing in the darkened room of the cottage of\ndeath, declaiming the CONFITEOR; of her seated at the piano, under the\npure, mellowed candle-light; of her leaning her chin on her hands, and\ngazing meditatively at the leafy background of the woods they were in;\nof her lying back, indolently content, in the deck-chair on the yacht of\nhis fancy--that yacht which a few hours before had seemed so brilliantly\nand bewitchingly real to him, and now--now--!\n\nHe sank in a heap upon the couch, and, burying his face among its\ncushions, wept and groaned aloud. His collapse was absolute. He sobbed\nwith the abandonment of one who, in the veritable presence of death,\nlets go all sense of relation to life.\n\nPresently some one was touching him on the shoulder--an incisive,\npointed touch--and he checked himself, and lifted his face.\n\n“You will have to get up, and present some sort of an appearance, and\ngo away at once,” Celia said to him in low, rapid tones. “Some gentlemen\nare at the door, whom I have been waiting for.”\n\nAs he stupidly sat up and tried to collect his faculties, Celia had\nopened the door and admitted two visitors. The foremost was Father\nForbes; and he, with some whispered, smiling words, presented to her his\ncompanion, a tall, robust, florid man of middle-age, with a frock-coat\nand a gray mustache, sharply waxed. The three spoke for a moment\ntogether. Then the priest's wandering eye suddenly lighted upon the\nfigure on the sofa. He stared, knitted his brows, and then lifted them\nin inquiry as he turned to Celia.\n\n“Poor man!” she said readily, in tones loud enough to reach Theron. “It\nis our neighbor, Father, the Rev. Mr. Ware. He hit upon my name in\nthe register quite unexpectedly, and I had him come up. He is in sore\ndistress--a great and sudden bereavement. He is going now. Won't you\nspeak to him in the hall--a few words, Father? It would please him. He\nis terribly depressed.”\n\nThe words had drawn Theron to his feet, as by some mechanical process.\nHe took up his hat and moved dumbly to the door. It seemed to him that\nCelia intended offering to shake hands; but he went past her with only\nsome confused exchange of glances and a murmured word or two. The tall\nstranger, who drew aside to let him pass, had acted as if he expected to\nbe introduced. Theron, emerging into the hall, leaned against the wall\nand looked dreamily at the priest, who had stepped out with him.\n\n“I am very sorry to learn that you are in trouble, Mr. Ware,” Father\nForbes said, gently enough, but in hurried tones. “Miss Madden is also\nin trouble. I mentioned to you that her brother had got into a serious\nscrape. I have brought my old friend, General Brady, to consult with\nher about the matter. He knows all the parties concerned, and he can set\nthings right if anybody can.”\n\n“It's a mistake about me--I 'm not in any trouble at all,” said Theron.\n“I just dropped in to make a friendly call.”\n\nThe priest glanced sharply at him, noting with a swift, informed\nscrutiny how he sprawled against the wall, and what vacuity his eyes and\nloosened lips expressed.\n\n“Then you have a talent for the inopportune amounting to positive\ngenius,” said Father Forbes, with a stormy smile.\n\n“Tell me this, Father Forbes,” the other demanded, with impulsive\nsuddenness, “is it true that you don't want me in your house again? Is\nthat the truth or not?”\n\n“The truth is always relative, Mr. Ware,” replied the priest, turning\naway, and closing the door of the parlor behind him with a decisive\nsound.\n\nLeft alone, Theron started to make his way downstairs. He found his\nlegs wavering under him and making zigzag movements of their own in a\nbewildering fashion. He referred this at first, in an outburst of fresh\ndespair, to the effects of his great grief. Then, as he held tight to\nthe banister and governed his descent step by step, it occurred to him\nthat it must be the wine he had had for breakfast. Upon examination, he\nwas not so unhappy, after all.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\nAt the second peal of the door-bell, Brother Soulsby sat up in bed.\nIt was still pitch-dark, and the memory of the first ringing fluttered\nmusically in his awakening consciousness as a part of some dream he had\nbeen having.\n\n“Who the deuce can that be?” he mused aloud, in querulous resentment at\nthe interruption.\n\n“Put your head out of the window, and ask,” suggested his wife,\ndrowsily.\n\nThe bell-pull scraped violently in its socket, and a third outburst of\nshrill reverberations clamored through the silent house.\n\n“Whatever you do, I'd do it before he yanked the whole thing to pieces,”\n added the wife, with more decision.\n\nBrother Soulsby was wide awake now. He sprang to the floor, and, groping\nabout in the obscurity, began drawing on some of his clothes. He rapped\non the window during the process, to show that the house was astir, and\na minute afterward made his way out of the room and down the stairs, the\nboards creaking under his stockinged feet as he went.\n\nNearly a quarter of an hour passed before he returned. Sister Soulsby,\nlying in sleepy quiescence, heard vague sounds of voices at the front\ndoor, and did not feel interested enough to lift her head and listen.\nA noise of footsteps on the sidewalk followed, first receding from the\ndoor, then turning toward it, this second time marking the presence of\nmore than one person. There seemed in this the implication of a guest,\nand she shook off the dozing impulses which enveloped her faculties,\nand waited to hear more. There came up, after further muttering of male\nvoices, the undeniable chink of coins striking against one another. Then\nmore footsteps, the resonant slam of a carriage door out in the street,\nthe grinding of wheels turning on the frosty road, and the racket of a\nvehicle and horses going off at a smart pace into the night. Somebody\nhad come, then. She yawned at the thought, but remained well awake,\ntracing idly in her mind, as various slight sounds rose from the lower\nfloor, the different things Soulsby was probably doing. Their spare room\nwas down there, directly underneath, but curiously enough no one seemed\nto enter it. The faint murmur of conversation which from time to\ntime reached her came from the parlor instead. At last she heard her\nhusband's soft tread coming up the staircase, and still there had been\nno hint of employing the guest-chamber. What could he be about? she\nwondered.\n\nBrother Soulsby came in, bearing a small lamp in his hand, the reddish\nlight of which, flaring upward, revealed an unlooked-for display of\namusement on his thin, beardless face. He advanced to the bedside,\nshading the glare from her blinking eyes with his palm, and grinned.\n\n“A thousand guesses, old lady,” he said, with a dry chuckle, “and you\nwouldn't have a ghost of a chance. You might guess till Hades froze over\nseven feet thick, and still you wouldn't hit it.”\n\nShe sat up in turn. “Good gracious, man,” she began, “you don't mean--”\n Here the cheerful gleam in his small eyes reassured her, and she sighed\nrelief, then smiled confusedly. “I half thought, just for the minute,”\n she explained, “it might be some bounder who'd come East to try and\nblackmail me. But no, who is it--and what on earth have you done with\nhim?”\n\nBrother Soulsby cackled in merriment. “It's Brother Ware of Octavius,\nout on a little bat, all by himself. He says he's been on the loose only\ntwo days; but it looks more like a fortnight.”\n\n“OUR Brother Ware?” she regarded him with open-eyed surprise.\n\n“Well, yes, I suppose he's OUR Brother Ware--some,” returned Soulsby,\ngenially. “He seems to think so, anyway.”\n\n“But tell me about it!” she urged eagerly. “What's the matter with him?\nHow does he explain it?”\n\n“Well, he explains it pretty badly, if you ask me,” said Soulsby, with\na droll, joking eye and a mock-serious voice. He seated himself on the\nside of the bed, facing her, and still considerately shielding her\nfrom the light of the lamp he held. “But don't think I suggested any\nexplanations. I've been a mother myself. He's merely filled himself up\nto the neck with rum, in the simple, ordinary, good old-fashioned way.\nThat's all. What is there to explain about that?”\n\nShe looked meditatively at him for a time, shaking her head. “No,\nSoulsby,” she said gravely, at last. “This isn't any laughing matter.\nYou may be sure something bad has happened, to set him off like that.\nI'm going to get up and dress right now. What time is it?”\n\n“Now don't you do anything of the sort,” he urged persuasively. “It\nisn't five o'clock; it'll be dark for nearly an hour yet. Just you turn\nover, and have another nap. He's all right. I put him on the sofa, with\nthe buffalo robe round him. You'll find him there, safe and sound, when\nit's time for white folks to get up. You know how it breaks you up all\nday, not to get your full sleep.”\n\n“I don't care if it makes me look as old as the everlasting hills,” she\nsaid. “Can't you understand, Soulsby? The thing worries me--gets on my\nnerves. I couldn't close an eye, if I tried. I took a great fancy to\nthat young man. I told you so at the time.”\n\nSoulsby nodded, and turned down the wick of his lamp a trifle. “Yes, I\nknow you did,” he remarked in placidly non-contentious tones. “I\ncan't say I saw much in him myself, but I daresay you're right.” There\nfollowed a moment's silence, during which he experimented in turning the\nwick up again. “But, anyway,” he went on, “there isn't anything you can\ndo. He'll sleep it off, and the longer he's left alone the better. It\nisn't as if we had a hired girl, who'd come down and find him there, and\ngive the whole thing away. He's fixed up there perfectly comfortable;\nand when he's had his sleep out, and wakes up on his own account, he'll\nbe feeling a heap better.”\n\nThe argument might have carried conviction, but on the instant the sound\nof footsteps came to them from the room below. The subdued noise rose\nregularly, as of one pacing to and fro.\n\n“No, Soulsby, YOU come back to bed, and get YOUR sleep out. I'm going\ndownstairs. It's no good talking; I'm going.”\n\nBrother Soulsby offered no further opposition, either by talk or\ndemeanor, but returned contentedly to bed, pulling the comforter over\nhis ears, and falling into the slow, measured respiration of tranquil\nslumber before his wife was ready to leave the room.\n\nThe dim, cold gray of twilight was sifting furtively through the lace\ncurtains of the front windows when Mrs. Soulsby, lamp in hand, entered\nthe parlor. She confronted a figure she would have hardly recognized.\nThe man seemed to have been submerged in a bath of disgrace. From the\ncrown of his head to the soles of his feet, everything about him was\naltered, distorted, smeared with an intangible effect of shame. In the\nvague gloom of the middle distance, between lamp and window, she noticed\nthat his shoulders were crouched, like those of some shambling tramp.\nThe frowsy shadows of a stubble beard lay on his jaw and throat. His\nclothes were crumpled and hung awry; his boots were stained with mud.\nThe silk hat on the piano told its battered story with dumb eloquence.\n\nLifting the lamp, she moved forward a step, and threw its light upon his\nface. A little groan sounded involuntarily upon her lips. Out of a mask\nof unpleasant features, swollen with drink and weighted by the physical\ncraving for rest and sleep, there stared at her two bloodshot eyes,\nshining with the wild light of hysteria. The effect of dishevelled hair,\nrelaxed muscles, and rough, half-bearded lower face lent to these eyes,\nas she caught their first glance, an unnatural glare. The lamp shook\nin her hand for an instant. Then, ashamed of herself, she held out her\nother hand fearlessly to him.\n\n“Tell me all about it, Theron,” she said calmly, and with a soothing,\nmotherly intonation in her voice.\n\nHe did not take the hand she offered, but suddenly, with a wailing moan,\ncast himself on his knees at her feet. He was so tall a man that the\nmovement could have no grace. He abased his head awkwardly, to bury\nit among the folds of the skirts at her ankles. She stood still for a\nmoment, looking down upon him. Then, blowing out the light, she reached\nover and set the smoking lamp on the piano near by. The daylight made\nthings distinguishable in a wan, uncertain way, throughout the room.\n\n“I have come out of hell, for the sake of hearing some human being speak\nto me like that!”\n\nThe thick utterance proceeded in a muffled fashion from where his face\ngrovelled against her dress. Its despairing accents appealed to her, but\neven more was she touched by the ungainly figure he made, sprawling on\nthe carpet.\n\n“Well, since you are out, stay out,” she answered, as reassuringly as\nshe could. “But get up and take a seat here beside me, like a sensible\nman, and tell me all about it. Come! I insist!”\n\nIn obedience to her tone, and the sharp tug at his shoulder with which\nshe emphasized it, he got slowly to his feet, and listlessly seated\nhimself on the sofa to which she pointed. He hung his head, and began\ncatching his breath with a periodical gasp, half hiccough, half sob.\n\n“First of all,” she said, in her brisk, matter-of-fact manner, “don't\nyou want to lie down there again, and have me tuck you up snug with the\nbuffalo robe, and go to sleep? That would be the best thing you could\ndo.”\n\nHe shook his head disconsolately, from side to side. “I can't!” he\ngroaned, with a swifter recurrence of the sob-like convulsions. “I'm\ndying for sleep, but I'm too--too frightened!”\n\n“Come, I'll sit beside you till you drop off,” she said, with masterful\ndecision. He suffered himself to be pushed into recumbency on the couch,\nand put his head with docility on the pillow she brought from the spare\nroom. When she had spread the fur over him, and pushed her chair close\nto the sofa, she stood by it for a little, looking down in meditation at\nhis demoralized face. Under the painful surface-blur of wretchedness\nand fatigued debauchery, she traced reflectively the lineaments of the\nyounger and cleanlier countenance she had seen a few months before.\nNothing essential had been taken away. There was only this pestiferous\noverlaying of shame and cowardice to be removed. The face underneath was\nstill all right.\n\nWith a soft, maternal touch, she smoothed the hair from his forehead\ninto order. Then she seated herself, and, when he got his hand out from\nunder the robe and thrust it forth timidly, she took it in hers and\nheld it in a warm, sympathetic grasp. He closed his eyes at this, and\ngradually the paroxysmal catch in his breathing lapsed. The daylight\nstrengthened, until at last tiny flecks of sunshine twinkled in the\nmeshes of the further curtains at the window. She fancied him asleep,\nand gently sought to disengage her hand, but his fingers clutched at it\nwith vehemence, and his eyes were wide open.\n\n“I can't sleep at all,” he murmured. “I want to talk.”\n\n“There 's nothing in the world to hinder you,” she commented smilingly.\n\n“I tell you the solemn truth,” he said, lifting his voice in dogged\nassertion: “the best sermon I ever preached in my life, I preached only\nthree weeks ago, at the camp-meeting. It was admitted by everybody to be\nfar and away my finest effort! They will tell you the same!”\n\n“It's quite likely,” assented Sister Soulsby. “I quite believe it.”\n\n“Then how can anybody say that I've degenerated, that I've become a\nfool?” he demanded.\n\n“I haven't heard anybody hint at such a thing,” she answered quietly.\n\n“No, of course, YOU haven't heard them!” he cried. “I heard them,\nthough!” Then, forcing himself to a sitting posture, against the\nrestraint of her hand, he flung back the covering. “I'm burning hot\nalready! Yes, those were the identical words: I haven't improved; I've\ndegenerated. People hate me; they won't have me in their houses. They\nsay I'm a nuisance and a bore. I'm like a little nasty boy. That's what\nthey say. Even a young man who was dying--lying right on the edge of his\nopen grave--told me solemnly that I reminded him of a saint once, but I\nwas only fit for a barkeeper now. They say I really don't know anything\nat all. And I'm not only a fool, they say, I'm a dishonest fool into the\nbargain!”\n\n“But who says such twaddle as that?” she returned consolingly. The\nviolence of his emotion disturbed her. “You mustn't imagine such things.\nYou are among friends here. Other people are your friends, too. They\nhave the very highest opinion of you.”\n\n“I haven't a friend on earth but you!” he declared solemnly. His eyes\nglowed fiercely, and his voice sank into a grave intensity of tone. “I\nwas going to kill myself. I went on to the big bridge to throw myself\noff, and a policeman saw me trying to climb over the railing, and he\ngrabbed me and marched me away. Then he threw me out at the entrance,\nand said he would club my head off if I came there again. And then I\nwent and stood and let the cable-cars pass close by me, and twenty times\nI thought I had the nerve to throw myself under the next one, and then\nI waited for the next--and I was afraid! And then I was in a crowd\nsomewhere, and the warning came to me that I was going to die. The fool\nneedn't go kill himself: God would take care of that. It was my heart,\nyou know. I've had that terrible fluttering once before. It seized me\nthis time, and I fell down in the crowd, and some people walked over\nme, but some one else helped me up, and let me sit down in a big lighted\nhallway, the entrance to some theatre, and some one brought me some\nbrandy, but somebody else said I was drunk, and they took it away again,\nand put me out. They could see I was a fool, that I hadn't a friend\non earth. And when I went out, there was a big picture of a woman in\ntights, and the word 'Amazons' overhead--and then I remembered you. I\nknew you were my friend--the only one I have on earth.”\n\n“It is very flattering--to be remembered like that,” said Sister\nSoulsby, gently. The disposition to laugh was smothered by a pained\nperception of the suffering he was undergoing. His face had grown drawn\nand haggard under the burden of his memories as he rambled on.\n\n“So I came straight to you,” he began again. “I had just money enough\nleft to pay my fare. The rest is in my valise at the hotel--the Murray\nHill Hotel. It belongs to the church. I stole it from the church. When I\nam dead they can get it back again!”\n\nSister Soulsby forced a smile to her lips. “What nonsense you\ntalk--about dying!” she exclaimed. “Why, man alive, you'll sleep this\nall off like a top, if you'll only lie down and give yourself a chance.\nCome, now, you must do as you're told.”\n\nWith a resolute hand, she made him lie down again, and once more covered\nhim with the fur. He submitted, and did not even offer to put out his\narm this time, but looked in piteous dumbness at her for a long time.\nWhile she sat thus in silence, the sound of Brother Soulsby moving about\nupstairs became audible.\n\nTheron heard it, and the importance of hurrying on some further\ndisclosure seemed to suggest itself. “I can see you think I'm just\ndrunk,” he said, in low, sombre tones. “Of course that's what HE\nthought. The hackman thought so, and so did the conductor, and\neverybody. But I hoped you would know better. I was sure you would see\nthat it was something worse than that. See here, I'll tell you. Then\nyou'll understand. I've been drinking for two days and one whole night,\non my feet all the while, wandering alone in that big strange New York,\ngoing through places where they murdered men for ten cents, mixing\nmyself up with the worst people in low bar-rooms and dance-houses, and\nthey saw I had money in my pocket, too, and yet nobody touched me, or\noffered to lay a finger on me. Do you know why? They understood that I\nwanted to get drunk, and couldn't. The Indians won't harm an idiot, or\nlunatic, you know. Well, it was the same with these vilest of the vile.\nThey saw that I was a fool whom God had taken hold of, to break his\nheart first, and then to craze his brain, and then to fling him on a\ndunghill to die like a dog. They believe in God, those people. They're\nthe only ones who do, it seems to me. And they wouldn't interfere when\nthey saw what He was doing to me. But I tell you I wasn't drunk. I\nhaven't been drunk. I'm only heart-broken, and crushed out of shape\nand life--that's all. And I've crawled here just to have a friend by me\nwhen--when I come to the end.”\n\n“You're not talking very sensibly, or very bravely either, Theron Ware,”\n remarked his companion. “It's cowardly to give way to notions like\nthat.”\n\n“Oh, I 'm not afraid to die; don't think that,” he remonstrated wearily.\n“If there is a Judgment, it has hit me as hard as it can already. There\ncan't be any hell worse than that I've gone through. Here I am talking\nabout hell,” he continued, with a pained contraction of the muscles\nabout his mouth--a stillborn, malformed smile--“as if I believed in one!\nI've got way through all my beliefs, you know. I tell you that frankly.”\n\n“It's none of my business,” she reassured him. “I'm not your Bishop, or\nyour confessor. I'm just your friend, your pal, that's all.”\n\n“Look here!” he broke in, with some animation and a new intensity of\nglance and voice. “If I was going to live, I'd have some funny things to\ntell. Six months ago I was a good man. I not only seemed to be good, to\nothers and to myself, but I was good. I had a soul; I had a conscience.\nI was going along doing my duty, and I was happy in it. We were poor,\nAlice and I, and people behaved rather hard toward us, and sometimes we\nwere a little down in the mouth about it; but that was all. We really\nwere happy; and I--I really was a good man. Here's the kind of joke God\nplays! You see me here six months after. Look at me! I haven't got an\nhonest hair in my head. I'm a bad man through and through, that's what\nI am. I look all around at myself, and there isn't an atom left anywhere\nof the good man I used to be. And, mind you, I never lifted a finger\nto prevent the change. I didn't resist once; I didn't make any fight.\nI just walked deliberately down-hill, with my eyes wide open. I told\nmyself all the while that I was climbing uphill instead, but I knew in\nmy heart that it was a lie. Everything about me was a lie. I wouldn't be\ntelling the truth, even now, if--if I hadn't come to the end of my rope.\nNow, how do you explain that? How can it be explained? Was I really\nrotten to the core all the time, years ago, when I seemed to everybody,\nmyself and the rest, to be good and straight and sincere? Was it all a\nsham, or does God take a good man and turn him into an out-and-out bad\none, in just a few months--in the time that it takes an ear of corn to\nform and ripen and go off with the mildew? Or isn't there any God at\nall--but only men who live and die like animals? And that would explain\nmy case, wouldn't it? I got bitten and went vicious and crazy, and\nthey've had to chase me out and hunt me to my death like a mad dog! Yes,\nthat makes it all very simple. It isn't worth while to discuss me at\nall as if I had a soul, is it? I'm just one more mongrel cur that's gone\nmad, and must be put out of the way. That's all.”\n\n“See here,” said Sister Soulsby, alertly, “I half believe that a good\ncuffing is what you really stand in need of. Now you stop all this\nnonsense, and lie quiet and keep still! Do you hear me?”\n\nThe jocose sternness which she assumed, in words and manner, seemed to\nsoothe him. He almost smiled up at her in a melancholy way, and sighed\nprofoundly.\n\n“I've told you MY religion before,” she went on with gentleness. “The\nsheep and the goats are to be separated on Judgment Day, but not a\nminute sooner. In other words, as long as human life lasts, good, bad,\nand indifferent are all braided up together in every man's nature, and\nevery woman's too. You weren't altogether good a year ago, any more than\nyou're altogether bad now. You were some of both then; you're some\nof both now. If you've been making an extra sort of fool of yourself\nlately, why, now that you recognize it, the only thing to do is to slow\nsteam, pull up, and back engine in the other direction. In that way\nyou'll find things will even themselves up. It's a see-saw with all\nof us, Theron Ware--sometimes up; sometimes down. But nobody is rotten\nclear to the core.”\n\nHe closed his eyes, and lay in silence for a time.\n\n“This is what day of the week?” he asked, at last.\n\n“Friday, the nineteenth.”\n\n“Wednesday--that would be the seventeenth. That was the day ordained for\nmy slaughter. On that morning, I was the happiest man in the world.\nNo king could have been so proud and confident as I was. A wonderful\nromance had come to me. The most beautiful young woman in the world, the\nmost talented too, was waiting for me. An express train was carrying me\nto her, and it couldn't go fast enough to keep up with my eagerness. She\nwas very rich, and she loved me, and we were to live in eternal summer,\nwherever we liked, on a big, beautiful yacht. No one else had such a\nlife before him as that. It seemed almost too good for me, but I thought\nI had grown and developed so much that perhaps I would be worthy of it.\nOh, how happy I was! I tell you this because--because YOU are not like\nthe others. You will understand.”\n\n“Yes, I understand,” she said patiently. “Well--you were being so\nhappy.”\n\n“That was in the morning--Wednesday the seventeenth--early in the\nmorning. There was a little girl in the car, playing with some buttons,\nand when I tried to make friends with her, she looked at me, and she\nsaw, right at a glance, that I was a fool. 'Out of the mouths of babes\nand sucklings,' you know. She was the first to find it out. It began\nlike that, early in the morning. But then after that everybody knew it.\nThey had only to look at me and they said: 'Why, this is a fool--like a\nlittle nasty boy; we won't let him into our houses; we find him a bore.'\nThat is what they said.”\n\n“Did SHE say it?” Sister Soulsby permitted herself to ask.\n\nFor answer Theron bit his lips, and drew his chin under the fur, and\npushed his scowling face into the pillow. The spasmodic, sob-like gasps\nbegan to shake him again. She laid a compassionate hand upon his hot\nbrow.\n\n“That is why I made my way here to you,” he groaned piteously. “I knew\nyou would sympathize; I could tell it all to you. And it was so awful,\nto die there alone in the strange city--I couldn't do it--with nobody\nnear me who liked me, or thought well of me. Alice would hate me. There\nwas no one but you. I wanted to be with you--at the last.”\n\nHis quavering voice broke off in a gust of weeping, and his face frankly\nsurrendered itself to the distortions of a crying child's countenance,\nwide-mouthed and tragically grotesque in its abandonment of control.\n\nSister Soulsby, as her husband's boots were heard descending the stairs,\nrose, and drew the robe up to half cover his agonized visage. She patted\nthe sufferer softly on the head, and then went to the stair-door.\n\n“I think he'll go to sleep now,” she said, lifting her voice to the\nnew-comer, and with a backward nod toward the couch. “Come out into the\nkitchen while I get breakfast, or into the sitting-room, or somewhere,\nso as not to disturb him. He's promised me to lie perfectly quiet, and\ntry to sleep.”\n\nWhen they had passed together out of the room, she turned. “Soulsby,”\n she said with half-playful asperity, “I'm disappointed in you. For a man\nwho's knocked about as much as you have, I must say you've picked up an\nastonishingly small outfit of gumption. That poor creature in there is\nno more drunk than I am. He's been drinking--yes, drinking like a\nfish; but it wasn't able to make him drunk. He's past being drunk; he's\ngrief-crazy. It's a case of 'woman.' Some girl has made a fool of him,\nand decoyed him up in a balloon, and let him drop. He's been hurt bad,\ntoo.”\n\n“We have all been hurt in our day and generation,” responded Brother\nSoulsby, genially. “Don't you worry; he'll sleep that off too. It takes\nlonger than drink, and it doesn't begin to be so pleasant, but it can be\nslept off. Take my word for it, he'll be a different man by noon.”\n\nWhen noon came, however, Brother Soulsby was on his way to summon one\nof the village doctors. Toward nightfall, he went out again to telegraph\nfor Alice.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nSpring fell early upon the pleasant southern slopes of the Susquehanna\ncountry. The snow went off as by magic. The trees budded and leaved\nbefore their time. The birds came and set up their chorus in the elms,\nwhile winter seemed still a thing of yesterday.\n\nAlice, clad gravely in black, stood again upon a kitchen-stoop, and\nlooked across an intervening space of back-yards and fences to where the\ntall boughs, fresh in their new verdure, were silhouetted against the\npure blue sky. The prospect recalled to her irresistibly another sunlit\nmorning, a year ago, when she had stood in the doorway of her own\nkitchen, and surveyed a scene not unlike this; it might have been with\nthe same carolling robins, the same trees, the same azure segment of\nthe tranquil, speckless dome. Then she was looking out upon surroundings\nnovel and strange to her, among which she must make herself at home as\nbest she could. But at least the ground was secure under her feet; at\nleast she had a home, and a word from her lips could summon her husband\nout, to stand beside her with his arm about her, and share her buoyant,\nhopeful joy in the promises of spring.\n\nTo think that that was only one little year ago--the mere revolution of\nfour brief seasons! And now--!\n\nSister Soulsby, wiping her hands on her apron, came briskly out upon\nthe stoop. Some cheerful commonplace was on her tongue, but a glance at\nAlice's wistful face kept it back. She passed an arm around her waist\ninstead, and stood in silence, looking at the elms.\n\n“It brings back memories to me--all this,” said Alice, nodding her head,\nand not seeking to dissemble the tears which sprang to her eyes.\n\n“The men will be down in a minute, dear,” the other reminded her.\n“They'd nearly finished packing before I put the biscuits in the oven.\nWe mustn't wear long faces before folks, you know.”\n\n“Yes, I know,” murmured Alice. Then, with a sudden impulse, she turned\nto her companion. “Candace,” she said fervently, “we're alone here for\nthe moment; I must tell you that if I don't talk gratitude to you, it's\nsimply and solely because I don't know where to begin, or what to say.\nI'm just dumfounded at your goodness. It takes my speech away. I only\nknow this, Candace: God will be very good to you.”\n\n“Tut! tut!” replied Sister Soulsby, “that's all right, you dear thing. I\nknow just how you feel. Don't dream of being under obligation to explain\nit to me, or to thank us at all. We've had all sorts of comfort out of\nthe thing--Soulsby and I. We used to get downright lonesome, here all\nby ourselves, and we've simply had a winter of pleasant company instead,\nthat s all. Besides, there's solid satisfaction in knowing that at\nlast, for once in our lives we've had a chance to be of some real use to\nsomebody who truly needed it. You can't imagine how stuck up that makes\nus in our own conceit. We feel as if we were George Peabody and Lady\nBurdett-Coutts, and several other philanthropists thrown in. No,\nseriously, don't think of it again. We're glad to have been able to do\nit all; and if you only go ahead now, and prosper and be happy, why,\nthat will be the only reward we want.”\n\n“I hope we shall do well,” said Alice. “Only tell me this, Candace. You\ndo think I was right, don't you, in insisting on Theron's leaving the\nministry altogether? He seems convinced enough now that it was the right\nthing to do; but I grow nervous sometimes lest he should find it harder\nthan he thought to get along in business, and regret the change--and\nblame me.”\n\n“I think you may rest easy in your mind about that,” the other\nresponded. “Whatever else he does, he will never want to come within\ngunshot of a pulpit again. It came too near murdering him for that.”\n\nAlice looked at her doubtfully. “Something came near murdering him, I\nknow. But it doesn't seem to me that I would say it was the ministry.\nAnd I guess you know pretty well yourself what it was. Of course, I've\nnever asked any questions, and I've hushed up everybody at Octavius\nwho tried to quiz me about it--his disappearance and my packing up\nand leaving, and all that--and I've never discussed the question with\nyou--but--”\n\n“No, and there's no good going into it now,” put in Sister Soulsby,\nwith amiable decisiveness. “It's all past and gone. In fact, I hardly\nremember much about it now myself. He simply got into deep water, poor\nsoul, and we've floated him out again, safe and sound. That's all.\nBut all the same, I was right in what I said. He was a mistake in the\nministry.”\n\n“But if you'd known him in previous years,” urged Alice, plaintively,\n“before we were sent to that awful Octavius. He was the very ideal of\nall a young minister should be. People used to simply worship him,\nhe was such a perfect preacher, and so pure-minded and friendly\nwith everybody, and threw himself into his work so. It was all that\nmiserable, contemptible Octavius that did the mischief.”\n\nSister Soulsby slowly shook her head. “If there hadn't been a screw\nloose somewhere,” she said gently, “Octavius wouldn't have hurt him. No,\ntake my word for it, he never was the right man for the place. He seemed\nto be, no doubt, but he wasn't. When pressure was put on him, it found\nout his weak spot like a shot, and pushed on it, and--well, it came near\nsmashing him, that's all.”\n\n“And do you think he'll always be a--a back-slider,” mourned Alice.\n\n“For mercy's sake, don't ever try to have him pretend to be anything\nelse!” exclaimed the other. “The last state of that man would be worse\nthan the first. You must make up your mind to that. And you mustn't show\nthat you're nervous about it. You mustn't get nervous! You mustn't be\nafraid of things. Just you keep a stiff upper lip, and say you WILL get\nalong, you WILL be happy. That's your only chance, Alice. He isn't going\nto be an angel of light, or a saint, or anything of that sort, and it's\nno good expecting it. But he'll be just an average kind of man--a little\nsore about some things, a little wiser than he was about some others.\nYou can get along perfectly with him, if you only keep your courage up,\nand don't show the white feather.”\n\n“Yes, I know; but I've had it pretty well taken out of me,” commented\nAlice. “It used to come easy to me to be cheerful and resolute and all\nthat; but it's different now.”\n\nSister Soulsby stole a swift glance at the unsuspecting face of her\ncompanion which was not all admiration, but her voice remained patiently\naffectionate. “Oh, that'll all come back to you, right enough. You'll\nhave your hands full, you know, finding a house, and unpacking all your\nold furniture, and buying new things, and getting your home settled.\nIt'll keep you so busy you won't have time to feel strange or lonesome,\none bit. You'll see how it'll tone you up. In a year's time you won't\nknow yourself in the looking-glass.”\n\n“Oh, my health is good enough,” said Alice; “but I can't help thinking,\nsuppose Theron should be taken sick again, away out there among\nstrangers. You know he's never appeared to me to have quite got his\nstrength back. These long illnesses, you know, they always leave a mark\non a man.”\n\n“Nonsense! He's strong as an ox,” insisted Sister Soulsby. “You mark my\nword, he'll thrive in Seattle like a green bay-tree.”\n\n“Seattle!” echoed Alice, meditatively. “It sounds like the other end of\nthe world, doesn't it?”\n\nThe noise of feet in the house broke upon the colloquy, and the women\nwent indoors, to join the breakfast party. During the meal, it was\nBrother Soulsby who bore the burden of the conversation. He was full of\nthe future of Seattle and the magnificent impending development of that\nPacific section. He had been out there, years ago, when it was next door\nto uninhabited. He had visited the district twice since, and the changes\ndiscoverable each new time were more wonderful than anything Aladdin's\nlamp ever wrought. He had secured for Theron, through some of his\nfriends in Portland, the superintendency of a land and real estate\ncompany, which had its headquarters in Seattle, but ambitiously linked\nits affairs with the future of all Washington Territory. In an hour's\ntime the hack would come to take the Wares and their baggage to the\ndepot, the first stage in their long journey across the continent\nto their new home. Brother Soulsby amiably filled the interval with\nreminiscences of the Oregon of twenty years back, with instructive\ndissertations upon the soil, climate, and seasons of Puget Sound and the\nColumbia valley, and, above all, with helpful characterizations of the\nsocial life which had begun to take form in this remotest West. He had\nnothing but confidence, to all appearances, in the success of his young\nfriend, now embarking on this new career. He seemed so sanguine about\nit that the whole atmosphere of the breakfast room lightened up, and the\nparting meal, surrounded by so many temptations to distraught broodings\nand silences as it was, became almost jovial in its spirit.\n\nAt last, it was time to look for the carriage. The trunks and hand-bags\nwere ready in the hall, and Sister Soulsby was tying up a package of\nsandwiches for Alice to keep by her in the train.\n\nTheron, with hat in hand, and overcoat on arm, loitered restlessly into\nthe kitchen, and watched this proceeding for a moment. Then he sauntered\nout upon the stoop, and, lifting his head and drawing as long a breath\nas he could, looked over at the elms.\n\nPerhaps the face was older and graver; it was hard to tell. The long\nwinter's illness, with its recurring crises and sustained confinement,\nhad bleached his skin and reduced his figure to gauntness, but there was\nnone the less an air of restored and secure good health about him. Only\nin the eyes themselves, as they rested briefly upon the prospect, did\na substantial change suggest itself. They did not dwell fondly upon the\npicture of the lofty, spreading boughs, with their waves of sap-green\nleafage stirring against the blue. They did not soften and glow this\ntime, at the thought of how wholly one felt sure of God's goodness in\nthese wonderful new mornings of spring.\n\nThey looked instead straight through the fairest and most moving\nspectacle in nature's processional, and saw afar off, in conjectural\nvision, a formless sort of place which was Seattle. They surveyed its\nimpalpable outlines, its undefined dimensions, with a certain cool\nglitter of hard-and-fast resolve. There rose before his fancy, out of\nthe chaos of these shapeless imaginings, some faces of men, then more\nbehind them, then a great concourse of uplifted countenances, crowded\nclose together as far as the eye could reach. They were attentive faces\nall, rapt, eager, credulous to a degree. Their eyes were admiringly bent\nupon a common object of excited interest. They were looking at HIM; they\nstrained their ears to miss no cadence of his voice. Involuntarily\nhe straightened himself, stretched forth his hand with the pale, thin\nfingers gracefully disposed, and passed it slowly before him from side\nto side, in a comprehensive, stately gesture. The audience rose at him,\nas he dropped his hand, and filled his day-dream with a mighty roar of\napplause, in volume like an ocean tempest, yet pitched for his hearing\nalone.\n\nHe smiled, shook himself with a little delighted tremor, and turned on\nthe stoop to the open door.\n\n“What Soulsby said about politics out there interested me enormously,”\n he remarked to the two women. “I shouldn't be surprised if I found\nmyself doing something in that line. I can speak, you know, if I can't\ndo anything else. Talk is what tells, these days. Who knows? I may turn\nup in Washington a full-blown senator before I'm forty. Stranger things\nhave happened than that, out West!”\n\n“We'll come down and visit you then, Soulsby and I,” said Sister\nSoulsby, cheerfully. “You shall take us to the White House, Alice, and\nintroduce us.”\n\n“Oh, it isn't likely I would come East,” said Alice, pensively. “Most\nprobably I'd be left to amuse myself in Seattle. But there--I think\nthat's the carriage driving up to the door.”"
