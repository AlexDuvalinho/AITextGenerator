MYRIEL\n\n\nIn 1815, M. Charles-François-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of D—— He was\nan old man of about seventy-five years of age; he had occupied the see\nof D—— since 1806.\n\nAlthough this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance\nof what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely\nfor the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various\nrumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the\nvery moment when he arrived in the diocese. True or false, that which\nis said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and\nabove all in their destinies, as that which they do. M. Myriel was the\nson of a councillor of the Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the\nnobility of the bar. It was said that his father, destining him to be\nthe heir of his own post, had married him at a very early age, eighteen\nor twenty, in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent\nin parliamentary families. In spite of this marriage, however, it was\nsaid that Charles Myriel created a great deal of talk. He was well\nformed, though rather short in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent;\nthe whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the\nworld and to gallantry.\n\nThe Revolution came; events succeeded each other with precipitation;\nthe parliamentary families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, were\ndispersed. M. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very beginning\nof the Revolution. There his wife died of a malady of the chest, from\nwhich she had long suffered. He had no children. What took place next\nin the fate of M. Myriel? The ruin of the French society of the olden\ndays, the fall of his own family, the tragic spectacles of ’93, which\nwere, perhaps, even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from\na distance, with the magnifying powers of terror,—did these cause the\nideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him? Was he, in the\nmidst of these distractions, these affections which absorbed his life,\nsuddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which\nsometimes overwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public\ncatastrophes would not shake, by striking at his existence and his\nfortune? No one could have told: all that was known was, that when he\nreturned from Italy he was a priest.\n\nIn 1804, M. Myriel was the Curé of B—— [Brignolles]. He was already\nadvanced in years, and lived in a very retired manner.\n\nAbout the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected with his\ncuracy—just what, is not precisely known—took him to Paris. Among other\npowerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his parishioners\nwas M. le Cardinal Fesch. One day, when the Emperor had come to visit\nhis uncle, the worthy Curé, who was waiting in the anteroom, found\nhimself present when His Majesty passed. Napoleon, on finding himself\nobserved with a certain curiosity by this old man, turned round and\nsaid abruptly:—\n\n“Who is this good man who is staring at me?”\n\n\n“Sire,” said M. Myriel, “you are looking at a good man, and I at a\ngreat man. Each of us can profit by it.”\n\n\nThat very evening, the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name of the Curé,\nand some time afterwards M. Myriel was utterly astonished to learn that\nhe had been appointed Bishop of D——\n\nWhat truth was there, after all, in the stories which were invented as\nto the early portion of M. Myriel’s life? No one knew. Very few\nfamilies had been acquainted with the Myriel family before the\nRevolution.\n\nM. Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town,\nwhere there are many mouths which talk, and very few heads which think.\nHe was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop, and because he\nwas a bishop. But after all, the rumors with which his name was\nconnected were rumors only,—noise, sayings, words; less than\nwords—_palabres_, as the energetic language of the South expresses it.\n\nHowever that may be, after nine years of episcopal power and of\nresidence in D——, all the stories and subjects of conversation which\nengross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into\nprofound oblivion. No one would have dared to mention them; no one\nwould have dared to recall them.\n\nM. Myriel had arrived at D—— accompanied by an elderly spinster,\nMademoiselle Baptistine, who was his sister, and ten years his junior.\n\nTheir only domestic was a female servant of the same age as\nMademoiselle Baptistine, and named Madame Magloire, who, after having\nbeen _the servant of M. le Curé_, now assumed the double title of maid\nto Mademoiselle and housekeeper to Monseigneur.\n\nMademoiselle Baptistine was a long, pale, thin, gentle creature; she\nrealized the ideal expressed by the word “respectable”; for it seems\nthat a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable. She had\nnever been pretty; her whole life, which had been nothing but a\nsuccession of holy deeds, had finally conferred upon her a sort of\npallor and transparency; and as she advanced in years she had acquired\nwhat may be called the beauty of goodness. What had been leanness in\nher youth had become transparency in her maturity; and this diaphaneity\nallowed the angel to be seen. She was a soul rather than a virgin. Her\nperson seemed made of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient body to\nprovide for sex; a little matter enclosing a light; large eyes forever\ndrooping;—a mere pretext for a soul’s remaining on the earth.\n\nMadame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent and\nbustling; always out of breath,—in the first place, because of her\nactivity, and in the next, because of her asthma.\n\nOn his arrival, M. Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with\nthe honors required by the Imperial decrees, which class a bishop\nimmediately after a major-general. The mayor and the president paid the\nfirst call on him, and he, in turn, paid the first call on the general\nand the prefect.\n\nThe installation over, the town waited to see its bishop at work.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—M. MYRIEL BECOMES M. WELCOME\n\n\nThe episcopal palace of D—— adjoins the hospital.\n\nThe episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house, built of stone at\nthe beginning of the last century by M. Henri Puget, Doctor of Theology\nof the Faculty of Paris, Abbé of Simore, who had been Bishop of D—— in\n1712. This palace was a genuine seignorial residence. Everything about\nit had a grand air,—the apartments of the Bishop, the drawing-rooms,\nthe chambers, the principal courtyard, which was very large, with walks\nencircling it under arcades in the old Florentine fashion, and gardens\nplanted with magnificent trees. In the dining-room, a long and superb\ngallery which was situated on the ground floor and opened on the\ngardens, M. Henri Puget had entertained in state, on July 29, 1714, My\nLords Charles Brûlart de Genlis, archbishop; Prince d’Embrun; Antoine\nde Mesgrigny, the capuchin, Bishop of Grasse; Philippe de Vendôme,\nGrand Prior of France, Abbé of Saint Honoré de Lérins; François de\nBerton de Crillon, bishop, Baron de Vence; César de Sabran de\nForcalquier, bishop, Seignor of Glandève; and Jean Soanen, Priest of\nthe Oratory, preacher in ordinary to the king, bishop, Seignor of\nSenez. The portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this\napartment; and this memorable date, the 29th of July, 1714, was there\nengraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble.\n\nThe hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story, with a\nsmall garden.\n\nThree days after his arrival, the Bishop visited the hospital. The\nvisit ended, he had the director requested to be so good as to come to\nhis house.\n\n“Monsieur the director of the hospital,” said he to him, “how many sick\npeople have you at the present moment?”\n\n\n“Twenty-six, Monseigneur.”\n\n\n“That was the number which I counted,” said the Bishop.\n\n“The beds,” pursued the director, “are very much crowded against each\nother.”\n\n\n“That is what I observed.”\n\n\n“The halls are nothing but rooms, and it is with difficulty that the\nair can be changed in them.”\n\n\n“So it seems to me.”\n\n\n“And then, when there is a ray of sun, the garden is very small for the\nconvalescents.”\n\n\n“That was what I said to myself.”\n\n\n“In case of epidemics,—we have had the typhus fever this year; we had\nthe sweating sickness two years ago, and a hundred patients at\ntimes,—we know not what to do.”\n\n\n“That is the thought which occurred to me.”\n\n\n“What would you have, Monseigneur?” said the director. “One must resign\none’s self.”\n\n\nThis conversation took place in the gallery dining-room on the ground\nfloor.\n\nThe Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he turned abruptly to the\ndirector of the hospital.\n\n“Monsieur,” said he, “how many beds do you think this hall alone would\nhold?”\n\n\n“Monseigneur’s dining-room?” exclaimed the stupefied director.\n\nThe Bishop cast a glance round the apartment, and seemed to be taking\nmeasures and calculations with his eyes.\n\n“It would hold full twenty beds,” said he, as though speaking to\nhimself. Then, raising his voice:—\n\n“Hold, Monsieur the director of the hospital, I will tell you\nsomething. There is evidently a mistake here. There are thirty-six of\nyou, in five or six small rooms. There are three of us here, and we\nhave room for sixty. There is some mistake, I tell you; you have my\nhouse, and I have yours. Give me back my house; you are at home here.”\n\n\nOn the following day the thirty-six patients were installed in the\nBishop’s palace, and the Bishop was settled in the hospital.\n\nM. Myriel had no property, his family having been ruined by the\nRevolution. His sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five\nhundred francs, which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage.\nM. Myriel received from the State, in his quality of bishop, a salary\nof fifteen thousand francs. On the very day when he took up his abode\nin the hospital, M. Myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once\nfor all, in the following manner. We transcribe here a note made by his\nown hand:—\n\nNOTE ON THE REGULATION OF MY HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES.\n\nFor the little seminary . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    1,500 livres\nSociety of the  mission . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      100   ”\n For the Lazarists of Montdidier . . . . . . . . . .      100   ”\n Seminary for foreign missions in Paris  . . . . . .      200   ”\n Congregation of the Holy Spirit . . . . . . . . . .      150   ”\n Religious establishments of the Holy Land . . . . .      100   ”\n Charitable maternity societies  . . . . . . . . . .      300   ”\n Extra, for that of Arles  . . . . . . . . . . . . .       50   ”\n Work for the amelioration of prisons  . . . . . . .      400   ”\n Work for the relief and delivery of prisoners . . .      500   ”\n To liberate fathers of families incarcerated for debt  1,000   ”\n Addition to the salary of the poor teachers of the\ndiocese  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    2,000   ”\n Public granary of the Hautes-Alpes  . . . . . . . .      100   ”\n Congregation of the ladies of D——, of Manosque, and of\nSisteron, for the gratuitous instruction of poor\ngirls  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    1,500   ”\n For the poor  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    6,000   ”\n My personal expenses  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    1,000   ”\n ———\nTotal  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   15,000   ”\n\n\nM. Myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period\nthat he occupied the see of D—— As has been seen, he called it\n_regulating his household expenses_.\n\nThis arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by Mademoiselle\nBaptistine. This holy woman regarded Monseigneur of D—— as at one and\nthe same time her brother and her bishop, her friend according to the\nflesh and her superior according to the Church. She simply loved and\nvenerated him. When he spoke, she bowed; when he acted, she yielded her\nadherence. Their only servant, Madame Magloire, grumbled a little. It\nwill be observed that Monsieur the Bishop had reserved for himself only\none thousand livres, which, added to the pension of Mademoiselle\nBaptistine, made fifteen hundred francs a year. On these fifteen\nhundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted.\n\nAnd when a village curate came to D——, the Bishop still found means to\nentertain him, thanks to the severe economy of Madame Magloire, and to\nthe intelligent administration of Mademoiselle Baptistine.\n\nOne day, after he had been in D—— about three months, the Bishop said:—\n\n“And still I am quite cramped with it all!”\n\n\n“I should think so!” exclaimed Madame Magloire. “Monseigneur has not\neven claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the\nexpense of his carriage in town, and for his journeys about the\ndiocese. It was customary for bishops in former days.”\n\n\n“Hold!” cried the Bishop, “you are quite right, Madame Magloire.”\n\n\nAnd he made his demand.\n\nSome time afterwards the General Council took this demand under\nconsideration, and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs,\nunder this heading: _Allowance to M. the Bishop for expenses of\ncarriage, expenses of posting, and expenses of pastoral visits._\n\nThis provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses; and a senator\nof the Empire, a former member of the Council of the Five Hundred which\nfavored the 18 Brumaire, and who was provided with a magnificent\nsenatorial office in the vicinity of the town of D——, wrote to M. Bigot\nde Préameneu, the minister of public worship, a very angry and\nconfidential note on the subject, from which we extract these authentic\nlines:—\n\n“Expenses of carriage? What can be done with it in a town of less than\nfour thousand inhabitants? Expenses of journeys? What is the use of\nthese trips, in the first place? Next, how can the posting be\naccomplished in these mountainous parts? There are no roads. No one\ntravels otherwise than on horseback. Even the bridge between Durance\nand Château-Arnoux can barely support ox-teams. These priests are all\nthus, greedy and avaricious. This man played the good priest when he\nfirst came. Now he does like the rest; he must have a carriage and a\nposting-chaise, he must have luxuries, like the bishops of the olden\ndays. Oh, all this priesthood! Things will not go well, M. le Comte,\nuntil the Emperor has freed us from these black-capped rascals. Down\nwith the Pope! [Matters were getting embroiled with Rome.] For my part,\nI am for Cæsar alone.” Etc., etc.\n\nOn the other hand, this affair afforded great delight to Madame\nMagloire. “Good,” said she to Mademoiselle Baptistine; “Monseigneur\nbegan with other people, but he has had to wind up with himself, after\nall. He has regulated all his charities. Now here are three thousand\nfrancs for us! At last!”\n\n\nThat same evening the Bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a\nmemorandum conceived in the following terms:—\n\nEXPENSES OF CARRIAGE AND CIRCUIT.\n\nFor furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital. 1,500 livres\nFor the maternity charitable society of Aix . . . . . . .   250   ”\n For the maternity charitable society of Draguignan  . . .   250   ”\n For foundlings  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   500   ”\n For orphans   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   500   ”\n ——-\nTotal  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,000   ”\n\n\nSuch was M. Myriel’s budget.\n\nAs for the chance episcopal perquisites, the fees for marriage bans,\ndispensations, private baptisms, sermons, benedictions, of churches or\nchapels, marriages, etc., the Bishop levied them on the wealthy with\nall the more asperity, since he bestowed them on the needy.\n\nAfter a time, offerings of money flowed in. Those who had and those who\nlacked knocked at M. Myriel’s door,—the latter in search of the alms\nwhich the former came to deposit. In less than a year the Bishop had\nbecome the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in\ndistress. Considerable sums of money passed through his hands, but\nnothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of\nlife, or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities.\n\nFar from it. As there is always more wretchedness below than there is\nbrotherhood above, all was given away, so to speak, before it was\nreceived. It was like water on dry soil; no matter how much money he\nreceived, he never had any. Then he stripped himself.\n\nThe usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at\nthe head of their charges and their pastoral letters, the poor people\nof the country-side had selected, with a sort of affectionate instinct,\namong the names and prenomens of their bishop, that which had a meaning\nfor them; and they never called him anything except Monseigneur\nBienvenu [Welcome]. We will follow their example, and will also call\nhim thus when we have occasion to name him. Moreover, this appellation\npleased him.\n\n“I like that name,” said he. “Bienvenu makes up for the Monseigneur.”\n\n\nWe do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable; we\nconfine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—A HARD BISHOPRIC FOR A GOOD BISHOP\n\n\nThe Bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted\nhis carriage into alms. The diocese of D—— is a fatiguing one. There\nare very few plains and a great many mountains; hardly any roads, as we\nhave just seen; thirty-two curacies, forty-one vicarships, and two\nhundred and eighty-five auxiliary chapels. To visit all these is quite\na task.\n\nThe Bishop managed to do it. He went on foot when it was in the\nneighborhood, in a tilted spring-cart when it was on the plain, and on\na donkey in the mountains. The two old women accompanied him. When the\ntrip was too hard for them, he went alone.\n\nOne day he arrived at Senez, which is an ancient episcopal city. He was\nmounted on an ass. His purse, which was very dry at that moment, did\nnot permit him any other equipage. The mayor of the town came to\nreceive him at the gate of the town, and watched him dismount from his\nass, with scandalized eyes. Some of the citizens were laughing around\nhim. “Monsieur the Mayor,” said the Bishop, “and Messieurs Citizens, I\nperceive that I shock you. You think it very arrogant in a poor priest\nto ride an animal which was used by Jesus Christ. I have done so from\nnecessity, I assure you, and not from vanity.”\n\n\nIn the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent, and talked\nrather than preached. He never went far in search of his arguments and\nhis examples. He quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example\nof a neighboring district. In the cantons where they were harsh to the\npoor, he said: “Look at the people of Briançon! They have conferred on\nthe poor, on widows and orphans, the right to have their meadows mown\nthree days in advance of every one else. They rebuild their houses for\nthem gratuitously when they are ruined. Therefore it is a country which\nis blessed by God. For a whole century, there has not been a single\nmurderer among them.”\n\n\nIn villages which were greedy for profit and harvest, he said: “Look at\nthe people of Embrun! If, at the harvest season, the father of a family\nhas his son away on service in the army, and his daughters at service\nin the town, and if he is ill and incapacitated, the curé recommends\nhim to the prayers of the congregation; and on Sunday, after the mass,\nall the inhabitants of the village—men, women, and children—go to the\npoor man’s field and do his harvesting for him, and carry his straw and\nhis grain to his granary.” To families divided by questions of money\nand inheritance he said: “Look at the mountaineers of Devolny, a\ncountry so wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty\nyears. Well, when the father of a family dies, the boys go off to seek\ntheir fortunes, leaving the property to the girls, so that they may\nfind husbands.” To the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits, and\nwhere the farmers ruined themselves in stamped paper, he said: “Look at\nthose good peasants in the valley of Queyras! There are three thousand\nsouls of them. Mon Dieu! it is like a little republic. Neither judge\nnor bailiff is known there. The mayor does everything. He allots the\nimposts, taxes each person conscientiously, judges quarrels for\nnothing, divides inheritances without charge, pronounces sentences\ngratuitously; and he is obeyed, because he is a just man among simple\nmen.” To villages where he found no schoolmaster, he quoted once more\nthe people of Queyras: “Do you know how they manage?” he said. “Since a\nlittle country of a dozen or fifteen hearths cannot always support a\nteacher, they have schoolmasters who are paid by the whole valley, who\nmake the round of the villages, spending a week in this one, ten days\nin that, and instruct them. These teachers go to the fairs. I have seen\nthem there. They are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear\nin the cord of their hat. Those who teach reading only have one pen;\nthose who teach reading and reckoning have two pens; those who teach\nreading, reckoning, and Latin have three pens. But what a disgrace to\nbe ignorant! Do like the people of Queyras!”\n\n\nThus he discoursed gravely and paternally; in default of examples, he\ninvented parables, going directly to the point, with few phrases and\nmany images, which characteristic formed the real eloquence of Jesus\nChrist. And being convinced himself, he was persuasive.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—WORKS CORRESPONDING TO WORDS\n\n\nHis conversation was gay and affable. He put himself on a level with\nthe two old women who had passed their lives beside him. When he\nlaughed, it was the laugh of a schoolboy. Madame Magloire liked to call\nhim Your Grace [_Votre Grandeur_]. One day he rose from his armchair,\nand went to his library in search of a book. This book was on one of\nthe upper shelves. As the bishop was rather short of stature, he could\nnot reach it. “Madame Magloire,” said he, “fetch me a chair. My\ngreatness [_grandeur_] does not reach as far as that shelf.”\n\n\nOne of his distant relatives, Madame la Comtesse de Lô, rarely allowed\nan opportunity to escape of enumerating, in his presence, what she\ndesignated as “the expectations” of her three sons. She had numerous\nrelatives, who were very old and near to death, and of whom her sons\nwere the natural heirs. The youngest of the three was to receive from a\ngrandaunt a good hundred thousand livres of income; the second was the\nheir by entail to the title of the Duke, his uncle; the eldest was to\nsucceed to the peerage of his grandfather. The Bishop was accustomed to\nlisten in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts. On\none occasion, however, he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual,\nwhile Madame de Lô was relating once again the details of all these\ninheritances and all these “expectations.” She interrupted herself\nimpatiently: “Mon Dieu, cousin! What are you thinking about?” “I am\nthinking,” replied the Bishop, “of a singular remark, which is to be\nfound, I believe, in St. Augustine,—‘Place your hopes in the man from\nwhom you do not inherit.’”\n\n\nAt another time, on receiving a notification of the decease of a\ngentleman of the country-side, wherein not only the dignities of the\ndead man, but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his\nrelatives, spread over an entire page: “What a stout back Death has!”\nhe exclaimed. “What a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on\nhim, and how much wit must men have, in order thus to press the tomb\ninto the service of vanity!”\n\n\nHe was gifted, on occasion, with a gentle raillery, which almost always\nconcealed a serious meaning. In the course of one Lent, a youthful\nvicar came to D——, and preached in the cathedral. He was tolerably\neloquent. The subject of his sermon was charity. He urged the rich to\ngive to the poor, in order to avoid hell, which he depicted in the most\nfrightful manner of which he was capable, and to win paradise, which he\nrepresented as charming and desirable. Among the audience there was a\nwealthy retired merchant, who was somewhat of a usurer, named M.\nGéborand, who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse\ncloth, serges, and woollen galloons. Never in his whole life had M.\nGéborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch. After the delivery of that\nsermon, it was observed that he gave a sou every Sunday to the poor old\nbeggar-women at the door of the cathedral. There were six of them to\nshare it. One day the Bishop caught sight of him in the act of\nbestowing this charity, and said to his sister, with a smile, “There is\nM. Géborand purchasing paradise for a sou.”\n\n\nWhen it was a question of charity, he was not to be rebuffed even by a\nrefusal, and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which\ninduced reflection. Once he was begging for the poor in a drawing-room\nof the town; there was present the Marquis de Champtercier, a wealthy\nand avaricious old man, who contrived to be, at one and the same time,\nan ultra-royalist and an ultra-Voltairian. This variety of man has\nactually existed. When the Bishop came to him, he touched his arm,\n_“You must give me something, M. le Marquis.”_ The Marquis turned round\nand answered dryly, _“I have poor people of my own, Monseigneur.” “Give\nthem to me,”_ replied the Bishop.\n\nOne day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral:—\n\n“My very dear brethren, my good friends, there are thirteen hundred and\ntwenty thousand peasants’ dwellings in France which have but three\nopenings; eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but\ntwo openings, the door and one window; and three hundred and forty-six\nthousand cabins besides which have but one opening, the door. And this\narises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows. Just\nput poor families, old women and little children, in those buildings,\nand behold the fevers and maladies which result! Alas! God gives air to\nmen; the law sells it to them. I do not blame the law, but I bless God.\nIn the department of the Isère, in the Var, in the two departments of\nthe Alpes, the Hautes, and the Basses, the peasants have not even\nwheelbarrows; they transport their manure on the backs of men; they\nhave no candles, and they burn resinous sticks, and bits of rope dipped\nin pitch. That is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the\nhilly country of Dauphiné. They make bread for six months at one time;\nthey bake it with dried cow-dung. In the winter they break this bread\nup with an axe, and they soak it for twenty-four hours, in order to\nrender it eatable. My brethren, have pity! behold the suffering on all\nsides of you!”\n\n\nBorn a Provençal, he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of\nthe south. He said, _“En bé! moussu, sés sagé?”_ as in lower Languedoc;\n_“Onté anaras passa?”_ as in the Basses-Alpes; _“Puerte un bouen moutu\nembe un bouen fromage grase,”_ as in upper Dauphiné. This pleased the\npeople extremely, and contributed not a little to win him access to all\nspirits. He was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the\nmountains. He understood how to say the grandest things in the most\nvulgar of idioms. As he spoke all tongues, he entered into all hearts.\n\nMoreover, he was the same towards people of the world and towards the\nlower classes. He condemned nothing in haste and without taking\ncircumstances into account. He said, “Examine the road over which the\nfault has passed.”\n\n\nBeing, as he described himself with a smile, an _ex-sinner_, he had\nnone of the asperities of austerity, and he professed, with a good deal\nof distinctness, and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous, a\ndoctrine which may be summed up as follows:—\n\n“Man has upon him his flesh, which is at once his burden and his\ntemptation. He drags it with him and yields to it. He must watch it,\ncheck it, repress it, and obey it only at the last extremity. There may\nbe some fault even in this obedience; but the fault thus committed is\nvenial; it is a fall, but a fall on the knees which may terminate in\nprayer.\n\n“To be a saint is the exception; to be an upright man is the rule. Err,\nfall, sin if you will, but be upright.\n\n“The least possible sin is the law of man. No sin at all is the dream\nof the angel. All which is terrestrial is subject to sin. Sin is a\ngravitation.”\n\n\nWhen he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly, and growing angry very\nquickly, “Oh! oh!” he said, with a smile; “to all appearance, this is a\ngreat crime which all the world commits. These are hypocrisies which\nhave taken fright, and are in haste to make protest and to put\nthemselves under shelter.”\n\n\nHe was indulgent towards women and poor people, on whom the burden of\nhuman society rest. He said, “The faults of women, of children, of the\nfeeble, the indigent, and the ignorant, are the fault of the husbands,\nthe fathers, the masters, the strong, the rich, and the wise.”\n\n\nHe said, moreover, “Teach those who are ignorant as many things as\npossible; society is culpable, in that it does not afford instruction\ngratis; it is responsible for the night which it produces. This soul is\nfull of shadow; sin is therein committed. The guilty one is not the\nperson who has committed the sin, but the person who has created the\nshadow.”\n\n\nIt will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of\njudging things: I suspect that he obtained it from the Gospel.\n\nOne day he heard a criminal case, which was in preparation and on the\npoint of trial, discussed in a drawing-room. A wretched man, being at\nthe end of his resources, had coined counterfeit money, out of love for\na woman, and for the child which he had had by her. Counterfeiting was\nstill punishable with death at that epoch. The woman had been arrested\nin the act of passing the first false piece made by the man. She was\nheld, but there were no proofs except against her. She alone could\naccuse her lover, and destroy him by her confession. She denied; they\ninsisted. She persisted in her denial. Thereupon an idea occurred to\nthe attorney for the crown. He invented an infidelity on the part of\nthe lover, and succeeded, by means of fragments of letters cunningly\npresented, in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival,\nand that the man was deceiving her. Thereupon, exasperated by jealousy,\nshe denounced her lover, confessed all, proved all.\n\nThe man was ruined. He was shortly to be tried at Aix with his\naccomplice. They were relating the matter, and each one was expressing\nenthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate. By bringing jealousy\ninto play, he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath, he had\neduced the justice of revenge. The Bishop listened to all this in\nsilence. When they had finished, he inquired,—\n\n“Where are this man and woman to be tried?”\n\n\n“At the Court of Assizes.”\n\n\nHe went on, “And where will the advocate of the crown be tried?”\n\n\nA tragic event occurred at D—— A man was condemned to death for murder.\nHe was a wretched fellow, not exactly educated, not exactly ignorant,\nwho had been a mountebank at fairs, and a writer for the public. The\ntown took a great interest in the trial. On the eve of the day fixed\nfor the execution of the condemned man, the chaplain of the prison fell\nill. A priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments.\nThey sent for the curé. It seems that he refused to come, saying, “That\nis no affair of mine. I have nothing to do with that unpleasant task,\nand with that mountebank: I, too, am ill; and besides, it is not my\nplace.” This reply was reported to the Bishop, who said, _“Monsieur le\nCuré is right: it is not his place; it is mine.”_\n\nHe went instantly to the prison, descended to the cell of the\n“mountebank,” called him by name, took him by the hand, and spoke to\nhim. He passed the entire day with him, forgetful of food and sleep,\npraying to God for the soul of the condemned man, and praying the\ncondemned man for his own. He told him the best truths, which are also\nthe most simple. He was father, brother, friend; he was bishop only to\nbless. He taught him everything, encouraged and consoled him. The man\nwas on the point of dying in despair. Death was an abyss to him. As he\nstood trembling on its mournful brink, he recoiled with horror. He was\nnot sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent. His\ncondemnation, which had been a profound shock, had, in a manner, broken\nthrough, here and there, that wall which separates us from the mystery\nof things, and which we call life. He gazed incessantly beyond this\nworld through these fatal breaches, and beheld only darkness. The\nBishop made him see light.\n\nOn the following day, when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch, the\nBishop was still there. He followed him, and exhibited himself to the\neyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross\nupon his neck, side by side with the criminal bound with cords.\n\nHe mounted the tumbril with him, he mounted the scaffold with him. The\nsufferer, who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day,\nwas radiant. He felt that his soul was reconciled, and he hoped in God.\nThe Bishop embraced him, and at the moment when the knife was about to\nfall, he said to him: “God raises from the dead him whom man slays; he\nwhom his brothers have rejected finds his Father once more. Pray,\nbelieve, enter into life: the Father is there.” When he descended from\nthe scaffold, there was something in his look which made the people\ndraw aside to let him pass. They did not know which was most worthy of\nadmiration, his pallor or his serenity. On his return to the humble\ndwelling, which he designated, with a smile, as _his palace_, he said\nto his sister, _“I have just officiated pontifically.”_\n\nSince the most sublime things are often those which are the least\nunderstood, there were people in the town who said, when commenting on\nthis conduct of the Bishop, _“It is affectation.”_\n\nThis, however, was a remark which was confined to the drawing-rooms.\nThe populace, which perceives no jest in holy deeds, was touched, and\nadmired him.\n\nAs for the Bishop, it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine,\nand it was a long time before he recovered from it.\n\nIn fact, when the scaffold is there, all erected and prepared, it has\nsomething about it which produces hallucination. One may feel a certain\nindifference to the death penalty, one may refrain from pronouncing\nupon it, from saying yes or no, so long as one has not seen a\nguillotine with one’s own eyes: but if one encounters one of them, the\nshock is violent; one is forced to decide, and to take part for or\nagainst. Some admire it, like de Maistre; others execrate it, like\nBeccaria. The guillotine is the concretion of the law; it is called\n_vindicate_; it is not neutral, and it does not permit you to remain\nneutral. He who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers.\nAll social problems erect their interrogation point around this\nchopping-knife. The scaffold is a vision. The scaffold is not a piece\nof carpentry; the scaffold is not a machine; the scaffold is not an\ninert bit of mechanism constructed of wood, iron and cords.\n\nIt seems as though it were a being, possessed of I know not what sombre\ninitiative; one would say that this piece of carpenter’s work saw, that\nthis machine heard, that this mechanism understood, that this wood,\nthis iron, and these cords were possessed of will. In the frightful\nmeditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears\nin terrible guise, and as though taking part in what is going on. The\nscaffold is the accomplice of the executioner; it devours, it eats\nflesh, it drinks blood; the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by\nthe judge and the carpenter, a spectre which seems to live with a\nhorrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted.\n\nTherefore, the impression was terrible and profound; on the day\nfollowing the execution, and on many succeeding days, the Bishop\nappeared to be crushed. The almost violent serenity of the funereal\nmoment had disappeared; the phantom of social justice tormented him.\nHe, who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant\nsatisfaction, seemed to be reproaching himself. At times he talked to\nhimself, and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice. This is\none which his sister overheard one evening and preserved: “I did not\nthink that it was so monstrous. It is wrong to become absorbed in the\ndivine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law. Death belongs\nto God alone. By what right do men touch that unknown thing?”\n\n\nIn course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished.\nNevertheless, it was observed that the Bishop thenceforth avoided\npassing the place of execution.\n\nM. Myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and\ndying. He did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty\nand his greatest labor. Widowed and orphaned families had no need to\nsummon him; he came of his own accord. He understood how to sit down\nand hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife\nof his love, of the mother who had lost her child. As he knew the\nmoment for silence he knew also the moment for speech. Oh, admirable\nconsoler! He sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness, but to\nmagnify and dignify it by hope. He said:—\n\n“Have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead. Think\nnot of that which perishes. Gaze steadily. You will perceive the living\nlight of your well-beloved dead in the depths of heaven.” He knew that\nfaith is wholesome. He sought to counsel and calm the despairing man,\nby pointing out to him the resigned man, and to transform the grief\nwhich gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze\nupon a star.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU MADE HIS CASSOCKS LAST TOO LONG\n\n\nThe private life of M. Myriel was filled with the same thoughts as his\npublic life. The voluntary poverty in which the Bishop of D—— lived,\nwould have been a solemn and charming sight for any one who could have\nviewed it close at hand.\n\nLike all old men, and like the majority of thinkers, he slept little.\nThis brief slumber was profound. In the morning he meditated for an\nhour, then he said his mass, either at the cathedral or in his own\nhouse. His mass said, he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk\nof his own cows. Then he set to work.\n\nA Bishop is a very busy man: he must every day receive the secretary of\nthe bishopric, who is generally a canon, and nearly every day his\nvicars-general. He has congregations to reprove, privileges to grant, a\nwhole ecclesiastical library to examine,—prayer-books, diocesan\ncatechisms, books of hours, etc.,—charges to write, sermons to\nauthorize, curés and mayors to reconcile, a clerical correspondence, an\nadministrative correspondence; on one side the State, on the other the\nHoly See; and a thousand matters of business.\n\nWhat time was left to him, after these thousand details of business,\nand his offices and his breviary, he bestowed first on the necessitous,\nthe sick, and the afflicted; the time which was left to him from the\nafflicted, the sick, and the necessitous, he devoted to work. Sometimes\nhe dug in his garden; again, he read or wrote. He had but one word for\nboth these kinds of toil; he called them _gardening_. “The mind is a\ngarden,” said he.\n\nTowards midday, when the weather was fine, he went forth and took a\nstroll in the country or in town, often entering lowly dwellings. He\nwas seen walking alone, buried in his own thoughts, his eyes cast down,\nsupporting himself on his long cane, clad in his wadded purple garment\nof silk, which was very warm, wearing purple stockings inside his\ncoarse shoes, and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden\ntassels of large bullion to droop from its three points.\n\nIt was a perfect festival wherever he appeared. One would have said\nthat his presence had something warming and luminous about it. The\nchildren and the old people came out to the doorsteps for the Bishop as\nfor the sun. He bestowed his blessing, and they blessed him. They\npointed out his house to any one who was in need of anything.\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nThe Comfortor  1b1-5-comfortor\n\n\nHere and there he halted, accosted the little boys and girls, and\nsmiled upon the mothers. He visited the poor so long as he had any\nmoney; when he no longer had any, he visited the rich.\n\nAs he made his cassocks last a long while, and did not wish to have it\nnoticed, he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak.\nThis inconvenienced him somewhat in summer.\n\nOn his return, he dined. The dinner resembled his breakfast.\n\nAt half-past eight in the evening he supped with his sister, Madame\nMagloire standing behind them and serving them at table. Nothing could\nbe more frugal than this repast. If, however, the Bishop had one of his\ncurés to supper, Madame Magloire took advantage of the opportunity to\nserve Monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake, or with some\nfine game from the mountains. Every curé furnished the pretext for a\ngood meal: the Bishop did not interfere. With that exception, his\nordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water, and oil\nsoup. Thus it was said in the town, _when the Bishop does not indulge\nin the cheer of a curé, he indulges in the cheer of a trappist_.\n\nAfter supper he conversed for half an hour with Mademoiselle Baptistine\nand Madame Magloire; then he retired to his own room and set to\nwriting, sometimes on loose sheets, and again on the margin of some\nfolio. He was a man of letters and rather learned. He left behind him\nfive or six very curious manuscripts; among others, a dissertation on\nthis verse in Genesis, _In the beginning, the spirit of God floated\nupon the waters_. With this verse he compares three texts: the Arabic\nverse which says, _The winds of God blew;_ Flavius Josephus who says,\n_A wind from above was precipitated upon the earth;_ and finally, the\nChaldaic paraphrase of Onkelos, which renders it, _A wind coming from\nGod blew upon the face of the waters_. In another dissertation, he\nexamines the theological works of Hugo, Bishop of Ptolemaïs,\ngreat-grand-uncle to the writer of this book, and establishes the fact,\nthat to this bishop must be attributed the divers little works\npublished during the last century, under the pseudonym of Barleycourt.\n\nSometimes, in the midst of his reading, no matter what the book might\nbe which he had in his hand, he would suddenly fall into a profound\nmeditation, whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of\nthe volume itself. These lines have often no connection whatever with\nthe book which contains them. We now have under our eyes a note written\nby him on the margin of a quarto entitled _Correspondence of Lord\nGermain with Generals Clinton, Cornwallis, and the Admirals on the\nAmerican station. Versailles, Poinçot, book-seller; and Paris, Pissot,\nbookseller, Quai des Augustins._\n\nHere is the note:—\n\n“Oh, you who are!\n\n“Ecclesiastes calls you the All-powerful; the Maccabees call you the\nCreator; the Epistle to the Ephesians calls you liberty; Baruch calls\nyou Immensity; the Psalms call you Wisdom and Truth; John calls you\nLight; the Books of Kings call you Lord; Exodus calls you Providence;\nLeviticus, Sanctity; Esdras, Justice; the creation calls you God; man\ncalls you Father; but Solomon calls you Compassion, and that is the\nmost beautiful of all your names.”\n\n\nToward nine o’clock in the evening the two women retired and betook\nthemselves to their chambers on the first floor, leaving him alone\nuntil morning on the ground floor.\n\nIt is necessary that we should, in this place, give an exact idea of\nthe dwelling of the Bishop of D——\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—WHO GUARDED HIS HOUSE FOR HIM\n\n\nThe house in which he lived consisted, as we have said, of a ground\nfloor, and one story above; three rooms on the ground floor, three\nchambers on the first, and an attic above. Behind the house was a\ngarden, a quarter of an acre in extent. The two women occupied the\nfirst floor; the Bishop was lodged below. The first room, opening on\nthe street, served him as dining-room, the second was his bedroom, and\nthe third his oratory. There was no exit possible from this oratory,\nexcept by passing through the bedroom, nor from the bedroom, without\npassing through the dining-room. At the end of the suite, in the\noratory, there was a detached alcove with a bed, for use in cases of\nhospitality. The Bishop offered this bed to country curates whom\nbusiness or the requirements of their parishes brought to D——\n\nThe pharmacy of the hospital, a small building which had been added to\nthe house, and abutted on the garden, had been transformed into a\nkitchen and cellar. In addition to this, there was in the garden a\nstable, which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital, and in\nwhich the Bishop kept two cows. No matter what the quantity of milk\nthey gave, he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick\npeople in the hospital.\n\n_“I am paying my tithes,”_ he said.\n\nHis bedroom was tolerably large, and rather difficult to warm in bad\nweather. As wood is extremely dear at D——, he hit upon the idea of\nhaving a compartment of boards constructed in the cow-shed. Here he\npassed his evenings during seasons of severe cold: he called it his\n_winter salon_.\n\nIn this winter salon, as in the dining-room, there was no other\nfurniture than a square table in white wood, and four straw-seated\nchairs. In addition to this the dining-room was ornamented with an\nantique sideboard, painted pink, in water colors. Out of a similar\nsideboard, properly draped with white napery and imitation lace, the\nBishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory.\n\nHis wealthy penitents and the sainted women of D—— had more than once\nassessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for\nMonseigneur’s oratory; on each occasion he had taken the money and had\ngiven it to the poor. “The most beautiful of altars,” he said, “is the\nsoul of an unhappy creature consoled and thanking God.”\n\n\nIn his oratory there were two straw prie-Dieu, and there was an\narmchair, also in straw, in his bedroom. When, by chance, he received\nseven or eight persons at one time, the prefect, or the general, or the\nstaff of the regiment in garrison, or several pupils from the little\nseminary, the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the\nstable, the prie-Dieu from the oratory, and the armchair from the\nbedroom: in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for\nthe visitors. A room was dismantled for each new guest.\n\nIt sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party; the Bishop\nthen relieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front\nof the chimney if it was winter, or by strolling in the garden if it\nwas summer.\n\nThere was still another chair in the detached alcove, but the straw was\nhalf gone from it, and it had but three legs, so that it was of service\nonly when propped against the wall. Mademoiselle Baptistine had also in\nher own room a very large easy-chair of wood, which had formerly been\ngilded, and which was covered with flowered pekin; but they had been\nobliged to hoist this bergère up to the first story through the window,\nas the staircase was too narrow; it could not, therefore, be reckoned\namong the possibilities in the way of furniture.\n\nMademoiselle Baptistine’s ambition had been to be able to purchase a\nset of drawing-room furniture in yellow Utrecht velvet, stamped with a\nrose pattern, and with mahogany in swan’s neck style, with a sofa. But\nthis would have cost five hundred francs at least, and in view of the\nfact that she had only been able to lay by forty-two francs and ten\nsous for this purpose in the course of five years, she had ended by\nrenouncing the idea. However, who is there who has attained his ideal?\n\nNothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the Bishop’s\nbedchamber. A glazed door opened on the garden; opposite this was the\nbed,—a hospital bed of iron, with a canopy of green serge; in the\nshadow of the bed, behind a curtain, were the utensils of the toilet,\nwhich still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world: there\nwere two doors, one near the chimney, opening into the oratory; the\nother near the bookcase, opening into the dining-room. The bookcase was\na large cupboard with glass doors filled with books; the chimney was of\nwood painted to represent marble, and habitually without fire. In the\nchimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron, ornamented above with two\ngarlanded vases, and flutings which had formerly been silvered with\nsilver leaf, which was a sort of episcopal luxury; above the\nchimney-piece hung a crucifix of copper, with the silver worn off,\nfixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which\nthe gilding had fallen; near the glass door a large table with an\ninkstand, loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes;\nbefore the table an armchair of straw; in front of the bed a prie-Dieu,\nborrowed from the oratory.\n\nTwo portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side of\nthe bed. Small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at\nthe side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented, one\nthe Abbé of Chaliot, bishop of Saint Claude; the other, the Abbé\nTourteau, vicar-general of Agde, abbé of Grand-Champ, order of Cîteaux,\ndiocese of Chartres. When the Bishop succeeded to this apartment, after\nthe hospital patients, he had found these portraits there, and had left\nthem. They were priests, and probably donors—two reasons for respecting\nthem. All that he knew about these two persons was, that they had been\nappointed by the king, the one to his bishopric, the other to his\nbenefice, on the same day, the 27th of April, 1785. Madame Magloire\nhaving taken the pictures down to dust, the Bishop had discovered these\nparticulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper,\nyellowed by time, and attached to the back of the portrait of the Abbé\nof Grand-Champ with four wafers.\n\nAt his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff,\nwhich finally became so old, that, in order to avoid the expense of a\nnew one, Madame Magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very\nmiddle of it. This seam took the form of a cross. The Bishop often\ncalled attention to it: “How delightful that is!” he said.\n\nAll the rooms in the house, without exception, those on the ground\nfloor as well as those on the first floor, were white-washed, which is\na fashion in barracks and hospitals.\n\nHowever, in their latter years, Madame Magloire discovered beneath the\npaper which had been washed over, paintings, ornamenting the apartment\nof Mademoiselle Baptistine, as we shall see further on. Before becoming\na hospital, this house had been the ancient parliament house of the\nBourgeois. Hence this decoration. The chambers were paved in red\nbricks, which were washed every week, with straw mats in front of all\nthe beds. Altogether, this dwelling, which was attended to by the two\nwomen, was exquisitely clean from top to bottom. This was the sole\nluxury which the Bishop permitted. He said, _“That takes nothing from\nthe poor.”_\n\nIt must be confessed, however, that he still retained from his former\npossessions six silver knives and forks and a soup-ladle, which Madame\nMagloire contemplated every day with delight, as they glistened\nsplendidly upon the coarse linen cloth. And since we are now painting\nthe Bishop of D—— as he was in reality, we must add that he had said\nmore than once, “I find it difficult to renounce eating from silver\ndishes.”\n\n\nTo this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive\nsilver, which he had inherited from a great-aunt. These candlesticks\nheld two wax candles, and usually figured on the Bishop’s\nchimney-piece. When he had any one to dinner, Madame Magloire lighted\nthe two candles and set the candlesticks on the table.\n\nIn the Bishop’s own chamber, at the head of his bed, there was a small\ncupboard, in which Madame Magloire locked up the six silver knives and\nforks and the big spoon every night. But it is necessary to add, that\nthe key was never removed.\n\nThe garden, which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which\nwe have mentioned, was composed of four alleys in cross-form, radiating\nfrom a tank. Another walk made the circuit of the garden, and skirted\nthe white wall which enclosed it. These alleys left behind them four\nsquare plots rimmed with box. In three of these, Madame Magloire\ncultivated vegetables; in the fourth, the Bishop had planted some\nflowers; here and there stood a few fruit-trees. Madame Magloire had\nonce remarked, with a sort of gentle malice: “Monseigneur, you who turn\neverything to account, have, nevertheless, one useless plot. It would\nbe better to grow salads there than bouquets.” “Madame Magloire,”\nretorted the Bishop, “you are mistaken. The beautiful is as useful as\nthe useful.” He added after a pause, “More so, perhaps.”\n\n\nThis plot, consisting of three or four beds, occupied the Bishop almost\nas much as did his books. He liked to pass an hour or two there,\ntrimming, hoeing, and making holes here and there in the earth, into\nwhich he dropped seeds. He was not as hostile to insects as a gardener\ncould have wished to see him. Moreover, he made no pretensions to\nbotany; he ignored groups and consistency; he made not the slightest\neffort to decide between Tournefort and the natural method; he took\npart neither with the buds against the cotyledons, nor with Jussieu\nagainst Linnæus. He did not study plants; he loved flowers. He\nrespected learned men greatly; he respected the ignorant still more;\nand, without ever failing in these two respects, he watered his\nflower-beds every summer evening with a tin watering-pot painted green.\n\nThe house had not a single door which could be locked. The door of the\ndining-room, which, as we have said, opened directly on the cathedral\nsquare, had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door\nof a prison. The Bishop had had all this ironwork removed, and this\ndoor was never fastened, either by night or by day, with anything\nexcept the latch. All that the first passer-by had to do at any hour,\nwas to give it a push. At first, the two women had been very much tried\nby this door, which was never fastened, but Monsieur de D—— had said to\nthem, “Have bolts put on your rooms, if that will please you.” They had\nended by sharing his confidence, or by at least acting as though they\nshared it. Madame Magloire alone had frights from time to time. As for\nthe Bishop, his thought can be found explained, or at least indicated,\nin the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a Bible, “This is\nthe shade of difference: the door of the physician should never be\nshut, the door of the priest should always be open.”\n\n\nOn another book, entitled _Philosophy of the Medical Science_, he had\nwritten this other note: “Am not I a physician like them? I also have\nmy patients, and then, too, I have some whom I call my unfortunates.”\n\n\nAgain he wrote: “Do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of\nyou. The very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs\nshelter.”\n\n\nIt chanced that a worthy curé, I know not whether it was the curé of\nCouloubroux or the curé of Pompierry, took it into his head to ask him\none day, probably at the instigation of Madame Magloire, whether\nMonsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion, to a\ncertain extent, in leaving his door unfastened day and night, at the\nmercy of any one who should choose to enter, and whether, in short, he\ndid not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little\nguarded. The Bishop touched his shoulder, with gentle gravity, and said\nto him, _“Nisi Dominus custodierit domum, in vanum vigilant qui\ncustodiunt eam,” Unless the Lord guard the house, in vain do they watch\nwho guard it._\n\nThen he spoke of something else.\n\nHe was fond of saying, “There is a bravery of the priest as well as the\nbravery of a colonel of dragoons,—only,” he added, “ours must be\ntranquil.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—CRAVATTE\n\n\nIt is here that a fact falls naturally into place, which we must not\nomit, because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of a\nman the Bishop of D—— was.\n\nAfter the destruction of the band of Gaspard Bès, who had infested the\ngorges of Ollioules, one of his lieutenants, Cravatte, took refuge in\nthe mountains. He concealed himself for some time with his bandits, the\nremnant of Gaspard Bès’s troop, in the county of Nice; then he made his\nway to Piédmont, and suddenly reappeared in France, in the vicinity of\nBarcelonette. He was first seen at Jauziers, then at Tuiles. He hid\nhimself in the caverns of the Joug-de-l’Aigle, and thence he descended\ntowards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of Ubaye and\nUbayette.\n\nHe even pushed as far as Embrun, entered the cathedral one night, and\ndespoiled the sacristy. His highway robberies laid waste the\ncountry-side. The gendarmes were set on his track, but in vain. He\nalways escaped; sometimes he resisted by main force. He was a bold\nwretch. In the midst of all this terror the Bishop arrived. He was\nmaking his circuit to Chastelar. The mayor came to meet him, and urged\nhim to retrace his steps. Cravatte was in possession of the mountains\nas far as Arche, and beyond; there was danger even with an escort; it\nmerely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose.\n\n“Therefore,” said the Bishop, “I intend to go without escort.”\n\n\n“You do not really mean that, Monseigneur!” exclaimed the mayor.\n\n“I do mean it so thoroughly that I absolutely refuse any gendarmes, and\nshall set out in an hour.”\n\n\n“Set out?”\n\n\n“Set out.”\n\n\n“Alone?”\n\n\n“Alone.”\n\n\n“Monseigneur, you will not do that!”\n\n\n“There exists yonder in the mountains,” said the Bishop, “a tiny\ncommunity no bigger than that, which I have not seen for three years.\nThey are my good friends, those gentle and honest shepherds. They own\none goat out of every thirty that they tend. They make very pretty\nwoollen cords of various colors, and they play the mountain airs on\nlittle flutes with six holes. They need to be told of the good God now\nand then. What would they say to a bishop who was afraid? What would\nthey say if I did not go?”\n\n\n“But the brigands, Monseigneur?”\n\n\n“Hold,” said the Bishop, “I must think of that. You are right. I may\nmeet them. They, too, need to be told of the good God.”\n\n\n“But, Monseigneur, there is a band of them! A flock of wolves!”\n\n\n“Monsieur le maire, it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves\nthat Jesus has constituted me the shepherd. Who knows the ways of\nProvidence?”\n\n\n“They will rob you, Monseigneur.”\n\n\n“I have nothing.”\n\n\n“They will kill you.”\n\n\n“An old goodman of a priest, who passes along mumbling his prayers?\nBah! To what purpose?”\n\n\n“Oh, mon Dieu! what if you should meet them!”\n\n\n“I should beg alms of them for my poor.”\n\n\n“Do not go, Monseigneur. In the name of Heaven! You are risking your\nlife!”\n\n\n“Monsieur le maire,” said the Bishop, “is that really all? I am not in\nthe world to guard my own life, but to guard souls.”\n\n\nThey had to allow him to do as he pleased. He set out, accompanied only\nby a child who offered to serve as a guide. His obstinacy was bruited\nabout the country-side, and caused great consternation.\n\nHe would take neither his sister nor Madame Magloire. He traversed the\nmountain on mule-back, encountered no one, and arrived safe and sound\nat the residence of his “good friends,” the shepherds. He remained\nthere for a fortnight, preaching, administering the sacrament,\nteaching, exhorting. When the time of his departure approached, he\nresolved to chant a _Te Deum_ pontifically. He mentioned it to the\ncuré. But what was to be done? There were no episcopal ornaments. They\ncould only place at his disposal a wretched village sacristy, with a\nfew ancient chasubles of threadbare damask adorned with imitation lace.\n\n“Bah!” said the Bishop. “Let us announce our _Te Deum_ from the pulpit,\nnevertheless, Monsieur le Curé. Things will arrange themselves.”\n\n\nThey instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood. All the\nmagnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed\nto clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly.\n\nWhile they were thus embarrassed, a large chest was brought and\ndeposited in the presbytery for the Bishop, by two unknown horsemen,\nwho departed on the instant. The chest was opened; it contained a cope\nof cloth of gold, a mitre ornamented with diamonds, an archbishop’s\ncross, a magnificent crosier,—all the pontifical vestments which had\nbeen stolen a month previously from the treasury of Notre Dame\nd’Embrun. In the chest was a paper, on which these words were written,\n_“From Cravatte to Monseigneur Bienvenu.”_\n\n“Did not I say that things would come right of themselves?” said the\nBishop. Then he added, with a smile, “To him who contents himself with\nthe surplice of a curate, God sends the cope of an archbishop.”\n\n\n“Monseigneur,” murmured the curé, throwing back his head with a smile.\n“God—or the Devil.”\n\n\nThe Bishop looked steadily at the curé, and repeated with authority,\n“God!”\n\n\nWhen he returned to Chastelar, the people came out to stare at him as\nat a curiosity, all along the road. At the priest’s house in Chastelar\nhe rejoined Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire, who were\nwaiting for him, and he said to his sister: “Well! was I in the right?\nThe poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands, and he\nreturns from them with his hands full. I set out bearing only my faith\nin God; I have brought back the treasure of a cathedral.”\n\n\nThat evening, before he went to bed, he said again: “Let us never fear\nrobbers nor murderers. Those are dangers from without, petty dangers.\nLet us fear ourselves. Prejudices are the real robbers; vices are the\nreal murderers. The great dangers lie within ourselves. What matters it\nwhat threatens our head or our purse! Let us think only of that which\nthreatens our soul.”\n\n\nThen, turning to his sister: “Sister, never a precaution on the part of\nthe priest, against his fellow-man. That which his fellow does, God\npermits. Let us confine ourselves to prayer, when we think that a\ndanger is approaching us. Let us pray, not for ourselves, but that our\nbrother may not fall into sin on our account.”\n\n\nHowever, such incidents were rare in his life. We relate those of which\nwe know; but generally he passed his life in doing the same things at\nthe same moment. One month of his year resembled one hour of his day.\n\nAs to what became of “the treasure” of the cathedral of Embrun, we\nshould be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction. It consisted of\nvery handsome things, very tempting things, and things which were very\nwell adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate. Stolen\nthey had already been elsewhere. Half of the adventure was completed;\nit only remained to impart a new direction to the theft, and to cause\nit to take a short trip in the direction of the poor. However, we make\nno assertions on this point. Only, a rather obscure note was found\namong the Bishop’s papers, which may bear some relation to this matter,\nand which is couched in these terms, _“The question is, to decide\nwhether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the\nhospital.”_\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—PHILOSOPHY AFTER DRINKING\n\n\nThe senator above mentioned was a clever man, who had made his own way,\nheedless of those things which present obstacles, and which are called\nconscience, sworn faith, justice, duty: he had marched straight to his\ngoal, without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his\ninterest. He was an old attorney, softened by success; not a bad man by\nany means, who rendered all the small services in his power to his\nsons, his sons-in-law, his relations, and even to his friends, having\nwisely seized upon, in life, good sides, good opportunities, good\nwindfalls. Everything else seemed to him very stupid. He was\nintelligent, and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple\nof Epicurus; while he was, in reality, only a product of\nPigault-Lebrun. He laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and\neternal things, and at the “crotchets of that good old fellow the\nBishop.” He even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in\nthe presence of M. Myriel himself, who listened to him.\n\nOn some semi-official occasion or other, I do not recollect what,\nCount*** [this senator] and M. Myriel were to dine with the prefect. At\ndessert, the senator, who was slightly exhilarated, though still\nperfectly dignified, exclaimed:—\n\n“Egad, Bishop, let’s have a discussion. It is hard for a senator and a\nbishop to look at each other without winking. We are two augurs. I am\ngoing to make a confession to you. I have a philosophy of my own.”\n\n\n“And you are right,” replied the Bishop. “As one makes one’s\nphilosophy, so one lies on it. You are on the bed of purple, senator.”\n\n\nThe senator was encouraged, and went on:—\n\n“Let us be good fellows.”\n\n\n“Good devils even,” said the Bishop.\n\n“I declare to you,” continued the senator, “that the Marquis d’Argens,\nPyrrhon, Hobbes, and M. Naigeon are no rascals. I have all the\nphilosophers in my library gilded on the edges.”\n\n\n“Like yourself, Count,” interposed the Bishop.\n\nThe senator resumed:—\n\n“I hate Diderot; he is an ideologist, a declaimer, and a revolutionist,\na believer in God at bottom, and more bigoted than Voltaire. Voltaire\nmade sport of Needham, and he was wrong, for Needham’s eels prove that\nGod is useless. A drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies\nthe _fiat lux_. Suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger;\nyou have the world. Man is the eel. Then what is the good of the\nEternal Father? The Jehovah hypothesis tires me, Bishop. It is good for\nnothing but to produce shallow people, whose reasoning is hollow. Down\nwith that great All, which torments me! Hurrah for Zero which leaves me\nin peace! Between you and me, and in order to empty my sack, and make\nconfession to my pastor, as it behooves me to do, I will admit to you\nthat I have good sense. I am not enthusiastic over your Jesus, who\npreaches renunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity. ‘Tis the\ncounsel of an avaricious man to beggars. Renunciation; why? Sacrifice;\nto what end? I do not see one wolf immolating himself for the happiness\nof another wolf. Let us stick to nature, then. We are at the top; let\nus have a superior philosophy. What is the advantage of being at the\ntop, if one sees no further than the end of other people’s noses? Let\nus live merrily. Life is all. That man has another future elsewhere, on\nhigh, below, anywhere, I don’t believe; not one single word of it. Ah!\nsacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me; I must take heed to\neverything I do; I must cudgel my brains over good and evil, over the\njust and the unjust, over the _fas_ and the _nefas_. Why? Because I\nshall have to render an account of my actions. When? After death. What\na fine dream! After my death it will be a very clever person who can\ncatch me. Have a handful of dust seized by a shadow-hand, if you can.\nLet us tell the truth, we who are initiated, and who have raised the\nveil of Isis: there is no such thing as either good or evil; there is\nvegetation. Let us seek the real. Let us get to the bottom of it. Let\nus go into it thoroughly. What the deuce! let us go to the bottom of\nit! We must scent out the truth; dig in the earth for it, and seize it.\nThen it gives you exquisite joys. Then you grow strong, and you laugh.\nI am square on the bottom, I am. Immortality, Bishop, is a chance, a\nwaiting for dead men’s shoes. Ah! what a charming promise! trust to it,\nif you like! What a fine lot Adam has! We are souls, and we shall be\nangels, with blue wings on our shoulder-blades. Do come to my\nassistance: is it not Tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel\nfrom star to star? Very well. We shall be the grasshoppers of the\nstars. And then, besides, we shall see God. Ta, ta, ta! What twaddle\nall these paradises are! God is a nonsensical monster. I would not say\nthat in the _Moniteur_, egad! but I may whisper it among friends.\n_Inter pocula_. To sacrifice the world to paradise is to let slip the\nprey for the shadow. Be the dupe of the infinite! I’m not such a fool.\nI am a nought. I call myself Monsieur le Comte Nought, senator. Did I\nexist before my birth? No. Shall I exist after death? No. What am I? A\nlittle dust collected in an organism. What am I to do on this earth?\nThe choice rests with me: suffer or enjoy. Whither will suffering lead\nme? To nothingness; but I shall have suffered. Whither will enjoyment\nlead me? To nothingness; but I shall have enjoyed myself. My choice is\nmade. One must eat or be eaten. I shall eat. It is better to be the\ntooth than the grass. Such is my wisdom. After which, go whither I push\nthee, the grave-digger is there; the Pantheon for some of us: all falls\ninto the great hole. End. _Finis_. Total liquidation. This is the\nvanishing-point. Death is death, believe me. I laugh at the idea of\nthere being any one who has anything to tell me on that subject. Fables\nof nurses; bugaboo for children; Jehovah for men. No; our to-morrow is\nthe night. Beyond the tomb there is nothing but equal nothingness. You\nhave been Sardanapalus, you have been Vincent de Paul—it makes no\ndifference. That is the truth. Then live your life, above all things.\nMake use of your _I_ while you have it. In truth, Bishop, I tell you\nthat I have a philosophy of my own, and I have my philosophers. I don’t\nlet myself be taken in with that nonsense. Of course, there must be\nsomething for those who are down,—for the barefooted beggars,\nknife-grinders, and miserable wretches. Legends, chimæras, the soul,\nimmortality, paradise, the stars, are provided for them to swallow.\nThey gobble it down. They spread it on their dry bread. He who has\nnothing else has the good God. That is the least he can have. I oppose\nno objection to that; but I reserve Monsieur Naigeon for myself. The\ngood God is good for the populace.”\n\n\nThe Bishop clapped his hands.\n\n“That’s talking!” he exclaimed. “What an excellent and really\nmarvellous thing is this materialism! Not every one who wants it can\nhave it. Ah! when one does have it, one is no longer a dupe, one does\nnot stupidly allow one’s self to be exiled like Cato, nor stoned like\nStephen, nor burned alive like Jeanne d’Arc. Those who have succeeded\nin procuring this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling\nthemselves irresponsible, and of thinking that they can devour\neverything without uneasiness,—places, sinecures, dignities, power,\nwhether well or ill acquired, lucrative recantations, useful\ntreacheries, savory capitulations of conscience,—and that they shall\nenter the tomb with their digestion accomplished. How agreeable that\nis! I do not say that with reference to you, senator. Nevertheless, it\nis impossible for me to refrain from congratulating you. You great\nlords have, so you say, a philosophy of your own, and for yourselves,\nwhich is exquisite, refined, accessible to the rich alone, good for all\nsauces, and which seasons the voluptuousness of life admirably. This\nphilosophy has been extracted from the depths, and unearthed by special\nseekers. But you are good-natured princes, and you do not think it a\nbad thing that belief in the good God should constitute the philosophy\nof the people, very much as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the\ntruffled turkey of the poor.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—THE BROTHER AS DEPICTED BY THE SISTER\n\n\nIn order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the Bishop\nof D——, and of the manner in which those two sainted women subordinated\ntheir actions, their thoughts, their feminine instincts even, which are\neasily alarmed, to the habits and purposes of the Bishop, without his\neven taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them, we cannot\ndo better than transcribe in this place a letter from Mademoiselle\nBaptistine to Madame the Vicomtess de Boischevron, the friend of her\nchildhood. This letter is in our possession.\n\nD——, Dec. 16, 18—. MY GOOD MADAM: Not a day passes without our speaking\nof you. It is our established custom; but there is another reason\nbesides. Just imagine, while washing and dusting the ceilings and\nwalls, Madam Magloire has made some discoveries; now our two chambers\nhung with antique paper whitewashed over, would not discredit a château\nin the style of yours. Madam Magloire has pulled off all the paper.\nThere were things beneath. My drawing-room, which contains no\nfurniture, and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing,\nis fifteen feet in height, eighteen square, with a ceiling which was\nformerly painted and gilded, and with beams, as in yours. This was\ncovered with a cloth while this was the hospital. And the woodwork was\nof the era of our grandmothers. But my room is the one you ought to\nsee. Madam Magloire has discovered, under at least ten thicknesses of\npaper pasted on top, some paintings, which without being good are very\ntolerable. The subject is Telemachus being knighted by Minerva in some\ngardens, the name of which escapes me. In short, where the Roman ladies\nrepaired on one single night. What shall I say to you? I have Romans,\nand Roman ladies [here occurs an illegible word], and the whole train.\nMadam Magloire has cleaned it all off; this summer she is going to have\nsome small injuries repaired, and the whole revarnished, and my chamber\nwill be a regular museum. She has also found in a corner of the attic\ntwo wooden pier-tables of ancient fashion. They asked us two crowns of\nsix francs each to regild them, but it is much better to give the money\nto the poor; and they are very ugly besides, and I should much prefer a\nround table of mahogany.\n\nI am always very happy. My brother is so good. He gives all he has to\nthe poor and sick. We are very much cramped. The country is trying in\nthe winter, and we really must do something for those who are in need.\nWe are almost comfortably lighted and warmed. You see that these are\ngreat treats.\n\nMy brother has ways of his own. When he talks, he says that a bishop\nought to be so. Just imagine! the door of our house is never fastened.\nWhoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother’s room. He\nfears nothing, even at night. That is his sort of bravery, he says.\n\nHe does not wish me or Madame Magloire feel any fear for him. He\nexposes himself to all sorts of dangers, and he does not like to have\nus even seem to notice it. One must know how to understand him.\n\nHe goes out in the rain, he walks in the water, he travels in winter.\nHe fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters, nor night.\n\nLast year he went quite alone into a country of robbers. He would not\ntake us. He was absent for a fortnight. On his return nothing had\nhappened to him; he was thought to be dead, but was perfectly well, and\nsaid, “This is the way I have been robbed!” And then he opened a trunk\nfull of jewels, all the jewels of the cathedral of Embrun, which the\nthieves had given him.\n\nWhen he returned on that occasion, I could not refrain from scolding\nhim a little, taking care, however, not to speak except when the\ncarriage was making a noise, so that no one might hear me.\n\nAt first I used to say to myself, “There are no dangers which will stop\nhim; he is terrible.” Now I have ended by getting used to it. I make a\nsign to Madam Magloire that she is not to oppose him. He risks himself\nas he sees fit. I carry off Madam Magloire, I enter my chamber, I pray\nfor him and fall asleep. I am at ease, because I know that if anything\nwere to happen to him, it would be the end of me. I should go to the\ngood God with my brother and my bishop. It has cost Madam Magloire more\ntrouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his\nimprudences. But now the habit has been acquired. We pray together, we\ntremble together, and we fall asleep. If the devil were to enter this\nhouse, he would be allowed to do so. After all, what is there for us to\nfear in this house? There is always some one with us who is stronger\nthan we. The devil may pass through it, but the good God dwells here.\n\nThis suffices me. My brother has no longer any need of saying a word to\nme. I understand him without his speaking, and we abandon ourselves to\nthe care of Providence. That is the way one has to do with a man who\npossesses grandeur of soul.\n\nI have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you\ndesire on the subject of the Faux family. You are aware that he knows\neverything, and that he has memories, because he is still a very good\nroyalist. They really are a very ancient Norman family of the\ngeneralship of Caen. Five hundred years ago there was a Raoul de Faux,\na Jean de Faux, and a Thomas de Faux, who were gentlemen, and one of\nwhom was a seigneur de Rochefort. The last was Guy-Étienne-Alexandre,\nand was commander of a regiment, and something in the light horse of\nBretagne. His daughter, Marie-Louise, married Adrien-Charles de\nGramont, son of the Duke Louis de Gramont, peer of France, colonel of\nthe French guards, and lieutenant-general of the army. It is written\nFaux, Fauq, and Faoucq.\n\nGood Madame, recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative,\nMonsieur the Cardinal. As for your dear Sylvanie, she has done well in\nnot wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me.\nShe is well, works as you would wish, and loves me.\n\nThat is all that I desire. The souvenir which she sent through you\nreached me safely, and it makes me very happy. My health is not so very\nbad, and yet I grow thinner every day. Farewell; my paper is at an end,\nand this forces me to leave you. A thousand good wishes.\n\nBAPTISTINE.\n\nP.S. Your grand nephew is charming. Do you know that he will soon be\nfive years old? Yesterday he saw some one riding by on horseback who\nhad on knee-caps, and he said, “What has he got on his knees?” He is a\ncharming child! His little brother is dragging an old broom about the\nroom, like a carriage, and saying, “Hu!”\n\n\nAs will be perceived from this letter, these two women understood how\nto mould themselves to the Bishop’s ways with that special feminine\ngenius which comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself.\nThe Bishop of D——, in spite of the gentle and candid air which never\ndeserted him, sometimes did things that were grand, bold, and\nmagnificent, without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact. They\ntrembled, but they let him alone. Sometimes Madame Magloire essayed a\nremonstrance in advance, but never at the time, nor afterwards. They\nnever interfered with him by so much as a word or sign, in any action\nonce entered upon. At certain moments, without his having occasion to\nmention it, when he was not even conscious of it himself in all\nprobability, so perfect was his simplicity, they vaguely felt that he\nwas acting as a bishop; then they were nothing more than two shadows in\nthe house. They served him passively; and if obedience consisted in\ndisappearing, they disappeared. They understood, with an admirable\ndelicacy of instinct, that certain cares may be put under constraint.\nThus, even when believing him to be in peril, they understood, I will\nnot say his thought, but his nature, to such a degree that they no\nlonger watched over him. They confided him to God.\n\nMoreover, Baptistine said, as we have just read, that her brother’s end\nwould prove her own. Madame Magloire did not say this, but she knew it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X—THE BISHOP IN THE PRESENCE OF AN UNKNOWN LIGHT\n\n\nAt an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in the\npreceding pages, he did a thing which, if the whole town was to be\nbelieved, was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountains\ninfested with bandits.\n\nIn the country near D—— a man lived quite alone. This man, we will\nstate at once, was a former member of the Convention. His name was G——\n\nMember of the Convention, G—— was mentioned with a sort of horror in\nthe little world of D—— A member of the Convention—can you imagine such\na thing? That existed from the time when people called each other\n_thou_, and when they said “citizen.” This man was almost a monster. He\nhad not voted for the death of the king, but almost. He was a\nquasi-regicide. He had been a terrible man. How did it happen that such\na man had not been brought before a provost’s court, on the return of\nthe legitimate princes? They need not have cut off his head, if you\nplease; clemency must be exercised, agreed; but a good banishment for\nlife. An example, in short, etc. Besides, he was an atheist, like all\nthe rest of those people. Gossip of the geese about the vulture.\n\nWas G—— a vulture after all? Yes; if he were to be judged by the\nelement of ferocity in this solitude of his. As he had not voted for\nthe death of the king, he had not been included in the decrees of\nexile, and had been able to remain in France.\n\nHe dwelt at a distance of three-quarters of an hour from the city, far\nfrom any hamlet, far from any road, in some hidden turn of a very wild\nvalley, no one knew exactly where. He had there, it was said, a sort of\nfield, a hole, a lair. There were no neighbors, not even passers-by.\nSince he had dwelt in that valley, the path which led thither had\ndisappeared under a growth of grass. The locality was spoken of as\nthough it had been the dwelling of a hangman.\n\nNevertheless, the Bishop meditated on the subject, and from time to\ntime he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked\nthe valley of the former member of the Convention, and he said, “There\nis a soul yonder which is lonely.”\n\n\nAnd he added, deep in his own mind, “I owe him a visit.”\n\n\nBut, let us avow it, this idea, which seemed natural at the first\nblush, appeared to him after a moment’s reflection, as strange,\nimpossible, and almost repulsive. For, at bottom, he shared the general\nimpression, and the old member of the Convention inspired him, without\nhis being clearly conscious of the fact himself, with that sentiment\nwhich borders on hate, and which is so well expressed by the word\nestrangement.\n\nStill, should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil? No.\nBut what a sheep!\n\nThe good Bishop was perplexed. Sometimes he set out in that direction;\nthen he returned.\n\nFinally, the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young\nshepherd, who served the member of the Convention in his hovel, had\ncome in quest of a doctor; that the old wretch was dying, that\nparalysis was gaining on him, and that he would not live over\nnight.—“Thank God!” some added.\n\nThe Bishop took his staff, put on his cloak, on account of his too\nthreadbare cassock, as we have mentioned, and because of the evening\nbreeze which was sure to rise soon, and set out.\n\nThe sun was setting, and had almost touched the horizon when the Bishop\narrived at the excommunicated spot. With a certain beating of the\nheart, he recognized the fact that he was near the lair. He strode over\na ditch, leaped a hedge, made his way through a fence of dead boughs,\nentered a neglected paddock, took a few steps with a good deal of\nboldness, and suddenly, at the extremity of the waste land, and behind\nlofty brambles, he caught sight of the cavern.\n\nIt was a very low hut, poor, small, and clean, with a vine nailed\nagainst the outside.\n\nNear the door, in an old wheel-chair, the armchair of the peasants,\nthere was a white-haired man, smiling at the sun.\n\nNear the seated man stood a young boy, the shepherd lad. He was\noffering the old man a jar of milk.\n\nWhile the Bishop was watching him, the old man spoke: “Thank you,” he\nsaid, “I need nothing.” And his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the\nchild.\n\nThe Bishop stepped forward. At the sound which he made in walking, the\nold man turned his head, and his face expressed the sum total of the\nsurprise which a man can still feel after a long life.\n\n“This is the first time since I have been here,” said he, “that any one\nhas entered here. Who are you, sir?”\n\n\nThe Bishop answered:—\n\n“My name is Bienvenu Myriel.”\n\n\n“Bienvenu Myriel? I have heard that name. Are you the man whom the\npeople call Monseigneur Welcome?”\n\n\n“I am.”\n\n\nThe old man resumed with a half-smile\n\n“In that case, you are my bishop?”\n\n\n“Something of that sort.”\n\n\n“Enter, sir.”\n\n\nThe member of the Convention extended his hand to the Bishop, but the\nBishop did not take it. The Bishop confined himself to the remark:—\n\n“I am pleased to see that I have been misinformed. You certainly do not\nseem to me to be ill.”\n\n\n“Monsieur,” replied the old man, “I am going to recover.”\n\n\nHe paused, and then said:—\n\n“I shall die three hours hence.”\n\n\nThen he continued:—\n\n“I am something of a doctor; I know in what fashion the last hour draws\non. Yesterday, only my feet were cold; to-day, the chill has ascended\nto my knees; now I feel it mounting to my waist; when it reaches the\nheart, I shall stop. The sun is beautiful, is it not? I had myself\nwheeled out here to take a last look at things. You can talk to me; it\ndoes not fatigue me. You have done well to come and look at a man who\nis on the point of death. It is well that there should be witnesses at\nthat moment. One has one’s caprices; I should have liked to last until\nthe dawn, but I know that I shall hardly live three hours. It will be\nnight then. What does it matter, after all? Dying is a simple affair.\nOne has no need of the light for that. So be it. I shall die by\nstarlight.”\n\n\nThe old man turned to the shepherd lad:—\n\n“Go to thy bed; thou wert awake all last night; thou art tired.”\n\n\nThe child entered the hut.\n\nThe old man followed him with his eyes, and added, as though speaking\nto himself:—\n\n“I shall die while he sleeps. The two slumbers may be good neighbors.”\n\n\nThe Bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been. He did\nnot think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us say the\nwhole, for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated\nlike the rest: he, who on occasion, was so fond of laughing at “His\nGrace,” was rather shocked at not being addressed as Monseigneur, and\nhe was almost tempted to retort “citizen.” He was assailed by a fancy\nfor peevish familiarity, common enough to doctors and priests, but\nwhich was not habitual with him. This man, after all, this member of\nthe Convention, this representative of the people, had been one of the\npowerful ones of the earth; for the first time in his life, probably,\nthe Bishop felt in a mood to be severe.\n\nMeanwhile, the member of the Convention had been surveying him with a\nmodest cordiality, in which one could have distinguished, possibly,\nthat humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning\nto dust.\n\nThe Bishop, on his side, although he generally restrained his\ncuriosity, which, in his opinion, bordered on a fault, could not\nrefrain from examining the member of the Convention with an attention\nwhich, as it did not have its course in sympathy, would have served his\nconscience as a matter of reproach, in connection with any other man. A\nmember of the Convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being\noutside the pale of the law, even of the law of charity. G——, calm, his\nbody almost upright, his voice vibrating, was one of those\noctogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist.\nThe Revolution had many of these men, proportioned to the epoch. In\nthis old man one was conscious of a man put to the proof. Though so\nnear to his end, he preserved all the gestures of health. In his clear\nglance, in his firm tone, in the robust movement of his shoulders,\nthere was something calculated to disconcert death. Azrael, the\nMohammedan angel of the sepulchre, would have turned back, and thought\nthat he had mistaken the door. G—— seemed to be dying because he willed\nit so. There was freedom in his agony. His legs alone were motionless.\nIt was there that the shadows held him fast. His feet were cold and\ndead, but his head survived with all the power of life, and seemed full\nof light. G——, at this solemn moment, resembled the king in that tale\nof the Orient who was flesh above and marble below.\n\nThere was a stone there. The Bishop sat down. The exordium was abrupt.\n\n“I congratulate you,” said he, in the tone which one uses for a\nreprimand. “You did not vote for the death of the king, after all.”\n\n\nThe old member of the Convention did not appear to notice the bitter\nmeaning underlying the words “after all.” He replied. The smile had\nquite disappeared from his face.\n\n“Do not congratulate me too much, sir. I did vote for the death of the\ntyrant.”\n\n\nIt was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity.\n\n“What do you mean to say?” resumed the Bishop.\n\n“I mean to say that man has a tyrant,—ignorance. I voted for the death\nof that tyrant. That tyrant engendered royalty, which is authority\nfalsely understood, while science is authority rightly understood. Man\nshould be governed only by science.”\n\n\n“And conscience,” added the Bishop.\n\n“It is the same thing. Conscience is the quantity of innate science\nwhich we have within us.”\n\n\nMonseigneur Bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language,\nwhich was very new to him.\n\nThe member of the Convention resumed:—\n\n“So far as Louis XVI. was concerned, I said ‘no.’ I did not think that\nI had the right to kill a man; but I felt it my duty to exterminate\nevil. I voted the end of the tyrant, that is to say, the end of\nprostitution for woman, the end of slavery for man, the end of night\nfor the child. In voting for the Republic, I voted for that. I voted\nfor fraternity, concord, the dawn. I have aided in the overthrow of\nprejudices and errors. The crumbling away of prejudices and errors\ncauses light. We have caused the fall of the old world, and the old\nworld, that vase of miseries, has become, through its upsetting upon\nthe human race, an urn of joy.”\n\n\n“Mixed joy,” said the Bishop.\n\n“You may say troubled joy, and to-day, after that fatal return of the\npast, which is called 1814, joy which has disappeared! Alas! The work\nwas incomplete, I admit: we demolished the ancient regime in deeds; we\nwere not able to suppress it entirely in ideas. To destroy abuses is\nnot sufficient; customs must be modified. The mill is there no longer;\nthe wind is still there.”\n\n\n“You have demolished. It may be of use to demolish, but I distrust a\ndemolition complicated with wrath.”\n\n\n“Right has its wrath, Bishop; and the wrath of right is an element of\nprogress. In any case, and in spite of whatever may be said, the French\nRevolution is the most important step of the human race since the\nadvent of Christ. Incomplete, it may be, but sublime. It set free all\nthe unknown social quantities; it softened spirits, it calmed,\nappeased, enlightened; it caused the waves of civilization to flow over\nthe earth. It was a good thing. The French Revolution is the\nconsecration of humanity.”\n\n\nThe Bishop could not refrain from murmuring:—\n\n“Yes? ’93!”\n\n\nThe member of the Convention straightened himself up in his chair with\nan almost lugubrious solemnity, and exclaimed, so far as a dying man is\ncapable of exclamation:—\n\n“Ah, there you go; ’93! I was expecting that word. A cloud had been\nforming for the space of fifteen hundred years; at the end of fifteen\nhundred years it burst. You are putting the thunderbolt on its trial.”\n\n\nThe Bishop felt, without, perhaps, confessing it, that something within\nhim had suffered extinction. Nevertheless, he put a good face on the\nmatter. He replied:—\n\n“The judge speaks in the name of justice; the priest speaks in the name\nof pity, which is nothing but a more lofty justice. A thunderbolt\nshould commit no error.” And he added, regarding the member of the\nConvention steadily the while, “Louis XVII.?”\n\n\nThe conventionary stretched forth his hand and grasped the Bishop’s\narm.\n\n“Louis XVII.! let us see. For whom do you mourn? is it for the innocent\nchild? very good; in that case I mourn with you. Is it for the royal\nchild? I demand time for reflection. To me, the brother of Cartouche,\nan innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the Place de Grève,\nuntil death ensued, for the sole crime of having been the brother of\nCartouche, is no less painful than the grandson of Louis XV., an\ninnocent child, martyred in the tower of the Temple, for the sole crime\nof having been grandson of Louis XV.”\n\n\n“Monsieur,” said the Bishop, “I like not this conjunction of names.”\n\n\n“Cartouche? Louis XV.? To which of the two do you object?”\n\n\nA momentary silence ensued. The Bishop almost regretted having come,\nand yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken.\n\nThe conventionary resumed:—\n\n“Ah, Monsieur Priest, you love not the crudities of the true. Christ\nloved them. He seized a rod and cleared out the Temple. His scourge,\nfull of lightnings, was a harsh speaker of truths. When he cried,\n_‘Sinite parvulos,’_ he made no distinction between the little\nchildren. It would not have embarrassed him to bring together the\nDauphin of Barabbas and the Dauphin of Herod. Innocence, Monsieur, is\nits own crown. Innocence has no need to be a highness. It is as august\nin rags as in fleurs de lys.”\n\n\n“That is true,” said the Bishop in a low voice.\n\n“I persist,” continued the conventionary G—— “You have mentioned Louis\nXVII. to me. Let us come to an understanding. Shall we weep for all the\ninnocent, all martyrs, all children, the lowly as well as the exalted?\nI agree to that. But in that case, as I have told you, we must go back\nfurther than ’93, and our tears must begin before Louis XVII. I will\nweep with you over the children of kings, provided that you will weep\nwith me over the children of the people.”\n\n\n“I weep for all,” said the Bishop.\n\n“Equally!” exclaimed conventionary G——; “and if the balance must\nincline, let it be on the side of the people. They have been suffering\nlonger.”\n\n\nAnother silence ensued. The conventionary was the first to break it. He\nraised himself on one elbow, took a bit of his cheek between his thumb\nand his forefinger, as one does mechanically when one interrogates and\njudges, and appealed to the Bishop with a gaze full of all the forces\nof the death agony. It was almost an explosion.\n\n“Yes, sir, the people have been suffering a long while. And hold! that\nis not all, either; why have you just questioned me and talked to me\nabout Louis XVII.? I know you not. Ever since I have been in these\nparts I have dwelt in this enclosure alone, never setting foot outside,\nand seeing no one but that child who helps me. Your name has reached me\nin a confused manner, it is true, and very badly pronounced, I must\nadmit; but that signifies nothing: clever men have so many ways of\nimposing on that honest goodman, the people. By the way, I did not hear\nthe sound of your carriage; you have left it yonder, behind the coppice\nat the fork of the roads, no doubt. I do not know you, I tell you. You\nhave told me that you are the Bishop; but that affords me no\ninformation as to your moral personality. In short, I repeat my\nquestion. Who are you? You are a bishop; that is to say, a prince of\nthe church, one of those gilded men with heraldic bearings and\nrevenues, who have vast prebends,—the bishopric of D—— fifteen thousand\nfrancs settled income, ten thousand in perquisites; total, twenty-five\nthousand francs,—who have kitchens, who have liveries, who make good\ncheer, who eat moor-hens on Friday, who strut about, a lackey before, a\nlackey behind, in a gala coach, and who have palaces, and who roll in\ntheir carriages in the name of Jesus Christ who went barefoot! You are\na prelate,—revenues, palace, horses, servants, good table, all the\nsensualities of life; you have this like the rest, and like the rest,\nyou enjoy it; it is well; but this says either too much or too little;\nthis does not enlighten me upon the intrinsic and essential value of\nthe man who comes with the probable intention of bringing wisdom to me.\nTo whom do I speak? Who are you?”\n\n\nThe Bishop hung his head and replied, _“Vermis sum_—I am a worm.”\n\n\n“A worm of the earth in a carriage?” growled the conventionary.\n\nIt was the conventionary’s turn to be arrogant, and the Bishop’s to be\nhumble.\n\nThe Bishop resumed mildly:—\n\n“So be it, sir. But explain to me how my carriage, which is a few paces\noff behind the trees yonder, how my good table and the moor-hens which\nI eat on Friday, how my twenty-five thousand francs income, how my\npalace and my lackeys prove that clemency is not a duty, and that ’93\nwas not inexorable.”\n\n\nThe conventionary passed his hand across his brow, as though to sweep\naway a cloud.\n\n“Before replying to you,” he said, “I beseech you to pardon me. I have\njust committed a wrong, sir. You are at my house, you are my guest, I\nowe you courtesy. You discuss my ideas, and it becomes me to confine\nmyself to combating your arguments. Your riches and your pleasures are\nadvantages which I hold over you in the debate; but good taste dictates\nthat I shall not make use of them. I promise you to make no use of them\nin the future.”\n\n\n“I thank you,” said the Bishop.\n\nG—— resumed.\n\n“Let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me. Where\nwere we? What were you saying to me? That ’93 was inexorable?”\n\n\n“Inexorable; yes,” said the Bishop. “What think you of Marat clapping\nhis hands at the guillotine?”\n\n\n“What think you of Bossuet chanting the _Te Deum_ over the\ndragonnades?”\n\n\nThe retort was a harsh one, but it attained its mark with the\ndirectness of a point of steel. The Bishop quivered under it; no reply\noccurred to him; but he was offended by this mode of alluding to\nBossuet. The best of minds will have their fetiches, and they sometimes\nfeel vaguely wounded by the want of respect of logic.\n\nThe conventionary began to pant; the asthma of the agony which is\nmingled with the last breaths interrupted his voice; still, there was a\nperfect lucidity of soul in his eyes. He went on:—\n\n“Let me say a few words more in this and that direction; I am willing.\nApart from the Revolution, which, taken as a whole, is an immense human\naffirmation, ’93 is, alas! a rejoinder. You think it inexorable, sir;\nbut what of the whole monarchy, sir? Carrier is a bandit; but what name\ndo you give to Montrevel? Fouquier-Tainville is a rascal; but what is\nyour opinion as to Lamoignon-Bâville? Maillard is terrible; but\nSaulx-Tavannes, if you please? Duchêne senior is ferocious; but what\nepithet will you allow me for the elder Letellier? Jourdan-Coupe-Tetê\nis a monster; but not so great a one as M. the Marquis de Louvois. Sir,\nsir, I am sorry for Marie Antoinette, archduchess and queen; but I am\nalso sorry for that poor Huguenot woman, who, in 1685, under Louis the\nGreat, sir, while with a nursing infant, was bound, naked to the waist,\nto a stake, and the child kept at a distance; her breast swelled with\nmilk and her heart with anguish; the little one, hungry and pale,\nbeheld that breast and cried and agonized; the executioner said to the\nwoman, a mother and a nurse, ‘Abjure!’ giving her her choice between\nthe death of her infant and the death of her conscience. What say you\nto that torture of Tantalus as applied to a mother? Bear this well in\nmind sir: the French Revolution had its reasons for existence; its\nwrath will be absolved by the future; its result is the world made\nbetter. From its most terrible blows there comes forth a caress for the\nhuman race. I abridge, I stop, I have too much the advantage; moreover,\nI am dying.”\n\n\nAnd ceasing to gaze at the Bishop, the conventionary concluded his\nthoughts in these tranquil words:—\n\n“Yes, the brutalities of progress are called revolutions. When they are\nover, this fact is recognized,—that the human race has been treated\nharshly, but that it has progressed.”\n\n\nThe conventionary doubted not that he had successively conquered all\nthe inmost intrenchments of the Bishop. One remained, however, and from\nthis intrenchment, the last resource of Monseigneur Bienvenu’s\nresistance, came forth this reply, wherein appeared nearly all the\nharshness of the beginning:—\n\n“Progress should believe in God. Good cannot have an impious servitor.\nHe who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race.”\n\n\nThe former representative of the people made no reply. He was seized\nwith a fit of trembling. He looked towards heaven, and in his glance a\ntear gathered slowly. When the eyelid was full, the tear trickled down\nhis livid cheek, and he said, almost in a stammer, quite low, and to\nhimself, while his eyes were plunged in the depths:—\n\n“O thou! O ideal! Thou alone existest!”\n\n\nThe Bishop experienced an indescribable shock.\n\nAfter a pause, the old man raised a finger heavenward and said:—\n\n“The infinite is. He is there. If the infinite had no person, person\nwould be without limit; it would not be infinite; in other words, it\nwould not exist. There is, then, an _I_. That _I_ of the infinite is\nGod.”\n\n\nThe dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice, and with\nthe shiver of ecstasy, as though he beheld some one. When he had\nspoken, his eyes closed. The effort had exhausted him. It was evident\nthat he had just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been\nleft to him. That which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in\ndeath. The supreme moment was approaching.\n\nThe Bishop understood this; time pressed; it was as a priest that he\nhad come: from extreme coldness he had passed by degrees to extreme\nemotion; he gazed at those closed eyes, he took that wrinkled, aged and\nice-cold hand in his, and bent over the dying man.\n\n“This hour is the hour of God. Do you not think that it would be\nregrettable if we had met in vain?”\n\n\nThe conventionary opened his eyes again. A gravity mingled with gloom\nwas imprinted on his countenance.\n\n“Bishop,” said he, with a slowness which probably arose more from his\ndignity of soul than from the failing of his strength, “I have passed\nmy life in meditation, study, and contemplation. I was sixty years of\nage when my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with\nits affairs. I obeyed. Abuses existed, I combated them; tyrannies\nexisted, I destroyed them; rights and principles existed, I proclaimed\nand confessed them. Our territory was invaded, I defended it; France\nwas menaced, I offered my breast. I was not rich; I am poor. I have\nbeen one of the masters of the state; the vaults of the treasury were\nencumbered with specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up\nthe walls, which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of\ngold and silver; I dined in Dead Tree Street, at twenty-two sous. I\nhave succored the oppressed, I have comforted the suffering. I tore the\ncloth from the altar, it is true; but it was to bind up the wounds of\nmy country. I have always upheld the march forward of the human race,\nforward towards the light, and I have sometimes resisted progress\nwithout pity. I have, when the occasion offered, protected my own\nadversaries, men of your profession. And there is at Peteghem, in\nFlanders, at the very spot where the Merovingian kings had their summer\npalace, a convent of Urbanists, the Abbey of Sainte Claire en Beaulieu,\nwhich I saved in 1793. I have done my duty according to my powers, and\nall the good that I was able. After which, I was hunted down, pursued,\npersecuted, blackened, jeered at, scorned, cursed, proscribed. For many\nyears past, I with my white hair have been conscious that many people\nthink they have the right to despise me; to the poor ignorant masses I\npresent the visage of one damned. And I accept this isolation of\nhatred, without hating any one myself. Now I am eighty-six years old; I\nam on the point of death. What is it that you have come to ask of me?”\n\n\n_“Your blessing,”_ said the Bishop.\n\nAnd he knelt down.\n\nWhen the Bishop raised his head again, the face of the conventionary\nhad become august. He had just expired.\n\nThe Bishop returned home, deeply absorbed in thoughts which cannot be\nknown to us. He passed the whole night in prayer. On the following\nmorning some bold and curious persons attempted to speak to him about\nmember of the Convention G——; he contented himself with pointing\nheavenward.\n\nFrom that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling\ntowards all children and sufferers.\n\nAny allusion to “that old wretch of a G——” caused him to fall into a\nsingular preoccupation. No one could say that the passage of that soul\nbefore his, and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his, did\nnot count for something in his approach to perfection.\n\nThis “pastoral visit” naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of\ncomment in all the little local coteries.\n\n“Was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a\nbishop? There was evidently no conversion to be expected. All those\nrevolutionists are backsliders. Then why go there? What was there to be\nseen there? He must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carried\noff by the devil.”\n\n\nOne day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herself\nspiritual, addressed this sally to him, “Monseigneur, people are\ninquiring when Your Greatness will receive the red cap!”—“Oh! oh!\nthat’s a coarse color,” replied the Bishop. “It is lucky that those who\ndespise it in a cap revere it in a hat.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI—A RESTRICTION\n\n\nWe should incur a great risk of deceiving ourselves, were we to\nconclude from this that Monseigneur Welcome was “a philosophical\nbishop,” or a “patriotic curé.” His meeting, which may almost be\ndesignated as his union, with conventionary G——, left behind it in his\nmind a sort of astonishment, which rendered him still more gentle. That\nis all.\n\nAlthough Monseigneur Bienvenu was far from being a politician, this is,\nperhaps, the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in\nthe events of that epoch, supposing that Monseigneur Bienvenu ever\ndreamed of having an attitude.\n\nLet us, then, go back a few years.\n\nSome time after the elevation of M. Myriel to the episcopate, the\nEmperor had made him a baron of the Empire, in company with many other\nbishops. The arrest of the Pope took place, as every one knows, on the\nnight of the 5th to the 6th of July, 1809; on this occasion, M. Myriel\nwas summoned by Napoleon to the synod of the bishops of France and\nItaly convened at Paris. This synod was held at Notre-Dame, and\nassembled for the first time on the 15th of June, 1811, under the\npresidency of Cardinal Fesch. M. Myriel was one of the ninety-five\nbishops who attended it. But he was present only at one sitting and at\nthree or four private conferences. Bishop of a mountain diocese, living\nso very close to nature, in rusticity and deprivation, it appeared that\nhe imported among these eminent personages, ideas which altered the\ntemperature of the assembly. He very soon returned to D—— He was\ninterrogated as to this speedy return, and he replied: _“I embarrassed\nthem. The outside air penetrated to them through me. I produced on them\nthe effect of an open door.”_\n\nOn another occasion he said, _“What would you have? Those gentlemen are\nprinces. I am only a poor peasant bishop.”_\n\nThe fact is that he displeased them. Among other strange things, it is\nsaid that he chanced to remark one evening, when he found himself at\nthe house of one of his most notable colleagues: “What beautiful\nclocks! What beautiful carpets! What beautiful liveries! They must be a\ngreat trouble. I would not have all those superfluities, crying\nincessantly in my ears: ‘There are people who are hungry! There are\npeople who are cold! There are poor people! There are poor people!’”\n\n\nLet us remark, by the way, that the hatred of luxury is not an\nintelligent hatred. This hatred would involve the hatred of the arts.\nNevertheless, in churchmen, luxury is wrong, except in connection with\nrepresentations and ceremonies. It seems to reveal habits which have\nvery little that is charitable about them. An opulent priest is a\ncontradiction. The priest must keep close to the poor. Now, can one\ncome in contact incessantly night and day with all this distress, all\nthese misfortunes, and this poverty, without having about one’s own\nperson a little of that misery, like the dust of labor? Is it possible\nto imagine a man near a brazier who is not warm? Can one imagine a\nworkman who is working near a furnace, and who has neither a singed\nhair, nor blackened nails, nor a drop of sweat, nor a speck of ashes on\nhis face? The first proof of charity in the priest, in the bishop\nespecially, is poverty.\n\nThis is, no doubt, what the Bishop of D—— thought.\n\nIt must not be supposed, however, that he shared what we call the\n“ideas of the century” on certain delicate points. He took very little\npart in the theological quarrels of the moment, and maintained silence\non questions in which Church and State were implicated; but if he had\nbeen strongly pressed, it seems that he would have been found to be an\nultramontane rather than a gallican. Since we are making a portrait,\nand since we do not wish to conceal anything, we are forced to add that\nhe was glacial towards Napoleon in his decline. Beginning with 1813, he\ngave in his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations. He\nrefused to see him, as he passed through on his return from the island\nof Elba, and he abstained from ordering public prayers for the Emperor\nin his diocese during the Hundred Days.\n\nBesides his sister, Mademoiselle Baptistine, he had two brothers, one a\ngeneral, the other a prefect. He wrote to both with tolerable\nfrequency. He was harsh for a time towards the former, because, holding\na command in Provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at Cannes, the\ngeneral had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had\npursued the Emperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is\ndesirous of allowing to escape. His correspondence with the other\nbrother, the ex-prefect, a fine, worthy man who lived in retirement at\nParis, Rue Cassette, remained more affectionate.\n\nThus Monseigneur Bienvenu also had his hour of party spirit, his hour\nof bitterness, his cloud. The shadow of the passions of the moment\ntraversed this grand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things.\nCertainly, such a man would have done well not to entertain any\npolitical opinions. Let there be no mistake as to our meaning: we are\nnot confounding what is called “political opinions” with the grand\naspiration for progress, with the sublime faith, patriotic, democratic,\nhumane, which in our day should be the very foundation of every\ngenerous intellect. Without going deeply into questions which are only\nindirectly connected with the subject of this book, we will simply say\nthis: It would have been well if Monseigneur Bienvenu had not been a\nRoyalist, and if his glance had never been, for a single instant,\nturned away from that serene contemplation in which is distinctly\ndiscernible, above the fictions and the hatreds of this world, above\nthe stormy vicissitudes of human things, the beaming of those three\npure radiances, truth, justice, and charity.\n\nWhile admitting that it was not for a political office that God created\nMonseigneur Welcome, we should have understood and admired his protest\nin the name of right and liberty, his proud opposition, his just but\nperilous resistance to the all-powerful Napoleon. But that which\npleases us in people who are rising pleases us less in the case of\npeople who are falling. We only love the fray so long as there is\ndanger, and in any case, the combatants of the first hour have alone\nthe right to be the exterminators of the last. He who has not been a\nstubborn accuser in prosperity should hold his peace in the face of\nruin. The denunciator of success is the only legitimate executioner of\nthe fall. As for us, when Providence intervenes and strikes, we let it\nwork. 1812 commenced to disarm us. In 1813 the cowardly breach of\nsilence of that taciturn legislative body, emboldened by catastrophe,\npossessed only traits which aroused indignation. And it was a crime to\napplaud, in 1814, in the presence of those marshals who betrayed; in\nthe presence of that senate which passed from one dunghill to another,\ninsulting after having deified; in the presence of that idolatry which\nwas loosing its footing and spitting on its idol,—it was a duty to turn\naside the head. In 1815, when the supreme disasters filled the air,\nwhen France was seized with a shiver at their sinister approach, when\nWaterloo could be dimly discerned opening before Napoleon, the mournful\nacclamation of the army and the people to the condemned of destiny had\nnothing laughable in it, and, after making all allowance for the\ndespot, a heart like that of the Bishop of D——, ought not perhaps to\nhave failed to recognize the august and touching features presented by\nthe embrace of a great nation and a great man on the brink of the\nabyss.\n\nWith this exception, he was in all things just, true, equitable,\nintelligent, humble and dignified, beneficent and kindly, which is only\nanother sort of benevolence. He was a priest, a sage, and a man. It\nmust be admitted, that even in the political views with which we have\njust reproached him, and which we are disposed to judge almost with\nseverity, he was tolerant and easy, more so, perhaps, than we who are\nspeaking here. The porter of the town-hall had been placed there by the\nEmperor. He was an old non-commissioned officer of the old guard, a\nmember of the Legion of Honor at Austerlitz, as much of a Bonapartist\nas the eagle. This poor fellow occasionally let slip inconsiderate\nremarks, which the law then stigmatized as _seditious speeches_. After\nthe imperial profile disappeared from the Legion of Honor, he never\ndressed himself in his regimentals, as he said, so that he should not\nbe obliged to wear his cross. He had himself devoutly removed the\nimperial effigy from the cross which Napoleon had given him; this made\na hole, and he would not put anything in its place. _“I will die,”_ he\nsaid, _“rather than wear the three frogs upon my heart!”_ He liked to\nscoff aloud at Louis XVIII. “The gouty old creature in English\ngaiters!” he said; _“let him take himself off to Prussia with that\nqueue of his.”_ He was happy to combine in the same imprecation the two\nthings which he most detested, Prussia and England. He did it so often\nthat he lost his place. There he was, turned out of the house, with his\nwife and children, and without bread. The Bishop sent for him, reproved\nhim gently, and appointed him beadle in the cathedral.\n\nIn the course of nine years Monseigneur Bienvenu had, by dint of holy\ndeeds and gentle manners, filled the town of D——with a sort of tender\nand filial reverence. Even his conduct towards Napoleon had been\naccepted and tacitly pardoned, as it were, by the people, the good and\nweakly flock who adored their emperor, but loved their bishop.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII—THE SOLITUDE OF MONSEIGNEUR WELCOME\n\n\nA bishop is almost always surrounded by a full squadron of little\nabbés, just as a general is by a covey of young officers. This is what\nthat charming Saint François de Sales calls somewhere “les prêtres\nblancs-becs,” callow priests. Every career has its aspirants, who form\na train for those who have attained eminence in it. There is no power\nwhich has not its dependents. There is no fortune which has not its\ncourt. The seekers of the future eddy around the splendid present.\nEvery metropolis has its staff of officials. Every bishop who possesses\nthe least influence has about him his patrol of cherubim from the\nseminary, which goes the round, and maintains good order in the\nepiscopal palace, and mounts guard over monseigneur’s smile. To please\na bishop is equivalent to getting one’s foot in the stirrup for a\nsub-diaconate. It is necessary to walk one’s path discreetly; the\napostleship does not disdain the canonship.\n\nJust as there are bigwigs elsewhere, there are big mitres in the\nChurch. These are the bishops who stand well at Court, who are rich,\nwell endowed, skilful, accepted by the world, who know how to pray, no\ndoubt, but who know also how to beg, who feel little scruple at making\na whole diocese dance attendance in their person, who are connecting\nlinks between the sacristy and diplomacy, who are abbés rather than\npriests, prelates rather than bishops. Happy those who approach them!\nBeing persons of influence, they create a shower about them, upon the\nassiduous and the favored, and upon all the young men who understand\nthe art of pleasing, of large parishes, prebends, archidiaconates,\nchaplaincies, and cathedral posts, while awaiting episcopal honors. As\nthey advance themselves, they cause their satellites to progress also;\nit is a whole solar system on the march. Their radiance casts a gleam\nof purple over their suite. Their prosperity is crumbled up behind the\nscenes, into nice little promotions. The larger the diocese of the\npatron, the fatter the curacy for the favorite. And then, there is\nRome. A bishop who understands how to become an archbishop, an\narchbishop who knows how to become a cardinal, carries you with him as\nconclavist; you enter a court of papal jurisdiction, you receive the\npallium, and behold! you are an auditor, then a papal chamberlain, then\nmonsignor, and from a Grace to an Eminence is only a step, and between\nthe Eminence and the Holiness there is but the smoke of a ballot. Every\nskull-cap may dream of the tiara. The priest is nowadays the only man\nwho can become a king in a regular manner; and what a king! the supreme\nking. Then what a nursery of aspirations is a seminary! How many\nblushing choristers, how many youthful abbés bear on their heads\nPerrette’s pot of milk! Who knows how easy it is for ambition to call\nitself vocation? in good faith, perchance, and deceiving itself,\ndevotee that it is.\n\nMonseigneur Bienvenu, poor, humble, retiring, was not accounted among\nthe big mitres. This was plain from the complete absence of young\npriests about him. We have seen that he “did not take” in Paris. Not a\nsingle future dreamed of engrafting itself on this solitary old man.\nNot a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth\nits foliage in his shadow. His canons and grand-vicars were good old\nmen, rather vulgar like himself, walled up like him in this diocese,\nwithout exit to a cardinalship, and who resembled their bishop, with\nthis difference, that they were finished and he was completed. The\nimpossibility of growing great under Monseigneur Bienvenu was so well\nunderstood, that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the\nseminary than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of Aix\nor of Auch, and went off in a great hurry. For, in short, we repeat it,\nmen wish to be pushed. A saint who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegation\nis a dangerous neighbor; he might communicate to you, by contagion, an\nincurable poverty, an anchylosis of the joints, which are useful in\nadvancement, and in short, more renunciation than you desire; and this\ninfectious virtue is avoided. Hence the isolation of Monseigneur\nBienvenu. We live in the midst of a gloomy society. Success; that is\nthe lesson which falls drop by drop from the slope of corruption.\n\nBe it said in passing, that success is a very hideous thing. Its false\nresemblance to merit deceives men. For the masses, success has almost\nthe same profile as supremacy. Success, that Menæchmus of talent, has\none dupe,—history. Juvenal and Tacitus alone grumble at it. In our day,\na philosophy which is almost official has entered into its service,\nwears the livery of success, and performs the service of its\nantechamber. Succeed: theory. Prosperity argues capacity. Win in the\nlottery, and behold! you are a clever man. He who triumphs is\nvenerated. Be born with a silver spoon in your mouth! everything lies\nin that. Be lucky, and you will have all the rest; be happy, and people\nwill think you great. Outside of five or six immense exceptions, which\ncompose the splendor of a century, contemporary admiration is nothing\nbut short-sightedness. Gilding is gold. It does no harm to be the first\narrival by pure chance, so long as you do arrive. The common herd is an\nold Narcissus who adores himself, and who applauds the vulgar herd.\nThat enormous ability by virtue of which one is Moses, Æschylus, Dante,\nMichael Angelo, or Napoleon, the multitude awards on the spot, and by\nacclamation, to whomsoever attains his object, in whatsoever it may\nconsist. Let a notary transfigure himself into a deputy: let a false\nCorneille compose _Tiridate;_ let a eunuch come to possess a harem; let\na military Prudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of an epoch;\nlet an apothecary invent cardboard shoe-soles for the army of the\nSambre-and-Meuse, and construct for himself, out of this cardboard,\nsold as leather, four hundred thousand francs of income; let a\npork-packer espouse usury, and cause it to bring forth seven or eight\nmillions, of which he is the father and of which it is the mother; let\na preacher become a bishop by force of his nasal drawl; let the steward\nof a fine family be so rich on retiring from service that he is made\nminister of finances,—and men call that Genius, just as they call the\nface of Mousqueton _Beauty_, and the mien of Claude _Majesty_. With the\nconstellations of space they confound the stars of the abyss which are\nmade in the soft mire of the puddle by the feet of ducks.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII—WHAT HE BELIEVED\n\n\nWe are not obliged to sound the Bishop of D—— on the score of\northodoxy. In the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood\nbut respect. The conscience of the just man should be accepted on his\nword. Moreover, certain natures being given, we admit the possible\ndevelopment of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs\nfrom our own.\n\nWhat did he think of this dogma, or of that mystery? These secrets of\nthe inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb, where\nsouls enter naked. The point on which we are certain is, that the\ndifficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his\ncase. No decay is possible to the diamond. He believed to the extent of\nhis powers. _“Credo in Patrem,”_ he often exclaimed. Moreover, he drew\nfrom good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the\nconscience, and which whispers to a man, “Thou art with God!”\n\n\nThe point which we consider it our duty to note is, that outside of and\nbeyond his faith, as it were, the Bishop possessed an excess of love.\nIt was in that quarter, _quia multum amavit_,—because he loved\nmuch—that he was regarded as vulnerable by “serious men,” “grave\npersons” and “reasonable people”; favorite locutions of our sad world\nwhere egotism takes its word of command from pedantry. What was this\nexcess of love? It was a serene benevolence which overflowed men, as we\nhave already pointed out, and which, on occasion, extended even to\nthings. He lived without disdain. He was indulgent towards God’s\ncreation. Every man, even the best, has within him a thoughtless\nharshness which he reserves for animals. The Bishop of D—— had none of\nthat harshness, which is peculiar to many priests, nevertheless. He did\nnot go as far as the Brahmin, but he seemed to have weighed this saying\nof Ecclesiastes: “Who knoweth whither the soul of the animal goeth?”\nHideousness of aspect, deformity of instinct, troubled him not, and did\nnot arouse his indignation. He was touched, almost softened by them. It\nseemed as though he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond the bounds of\nlife which is apparent, the cause, the explanation, or the excuse for\nthem. He seemed at times to be asking God to commute these penalties.\nHe examined without wrath, and with the eye of a linguist who is\ndeciphering a palimpsest, that portion of chaos which still exists in\nnature. This reverie sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings. One\nmorning he was in his garden, and thought himself alone, but his sister\nwas walking behind him, unseen by him: suddenly he paused and gazed at\nsomething on the ground; it was a large, black, hairy, frightful\nspider. His sister heard him say:—\n\n“Poor beast! It is not its fault!”\n\n\nWhy not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness?\nPuerile they may be; but these sublime puerilities were peculiar to\nSaint Francis d’Assisi and of Marcus Aurelius. One day he sprained his\nankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant. Thus lived this just\nman. Sometimes he fell asleep in his garden, and then there was nothing\nmore venerable possible.\n\nMonseigneur Bienvenu had formerly been, if the stories anent his youth,\nand even in regard to his manhood, were to be believed, a passionate,\nand, possibly, a violent man. His universal suavity was less an\ninstinct of nature than the result of a grand conviction which had\nfiltered into his heart through the medium of life, and had trickled\nthere slowly, thought by thought; for, in a character, as in a rock,\nthere may exist apertures made by drops of water. These hollows are\nuneffaceable; these formations are indestructible.\n\nIn 1815, as we think we have already said, he reached his seventy-fifth\nbirthday, but he did not appear to be more than sixty. He was not tall;\nhe was rather plump; and, in order to combat this tendency, he was fond\nof taking long strolls on foot; his step was firm, and his form was but\nslightly bent, a detail from which we do not pretend to draw any\nconclusion. Gregory XVI., at the age of eighty, held himself erect and\nsmiling, which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop. Monseigneur\nWelcome had what the people term a “fine head,” but so amiable was he\nthat they forgot that it was fine.\n\nWhen he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his\ncharms, and of which we have already spoken, people felt at their ease\nwith him, and joy seemed to radiate from his whole person. His fresh\nand ruddy complexion, his very white teeth, all of which he had\npreserved, and which were displayed by his smile, gave him that open\nand easy air which cause the remark to be made of a man, “He’s a good\nfellow”; and of an old man, “He is a fine man.” That, it will be\nrecalled, was the effect which he produced upon Napoleon. On the first\nencounter, and to one who saw him for the first time, he was nothing,\nin fact, but a fine man. But if one remained near him for a few hours,\nand beheld him in the least degree pensive, the fine man became\ngradually transfigured, and took on some imposing quality, I know not\nwhat; his broad and serious brow, rendered august by his white locks,\nbecame august also by virtue of meditation; majesty radiated from his\ngoodness, though his goodness ceased not to be radiant; one experienced\nsomething of the emotion which one would feel on beholding a smiling\nangel slowly unfold his wings, without ceasing to smile. Respect, an\nunutterable respect, penetrated you by degrees and mounted to your\nheart, and one felt that one had before him one of those strong,\nthoroughly tried, and indulgent souls where thought is so grand that it\ncan no longer be anything but gentle.\n\nAs we have seen, prayer, the celebration of the offices of religion,\nalms-giving, the consolation of the afflicted, the cultivation of a bit\nof land, fraternity, frugality, hospitality, renunciation, confidence,\nstudy, work, filled every day of his life. _Filled_ is exactly the\nword; certainly the Bishop’s day was quite full to the brim, of good\nwords and good deeds. Nevertheless, it was not complete if cold or\nrainy weather prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before\ngoing to bed, and after the two women had retired. It seemed to be a\nsort of rite with him, to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in\nthe presence of the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens.\nSometimes, if the two old women were not asleep, they heard him pacing\nslowly along the walks at a very advanced hour of the night. He was\nthere alone, communing with himself, peaceful, adoring, comparing the\nserenity of his heart with the serenity of the ether, moved amid the\ndarkness by the visible splendor of the constellations and the\ninvisible splendor of God, opening his heart to the thoughts which fall\nfrom the Unknown. At such moments, while he offered his heart at the\nhour when nocturnal flowers offer their perfume, illuminated like a\nlamp amid the starry night, as he poured himself out in ecstasy in the\nmidst of the universal radiance of creation, he could not have told\nhimself, probably, what was passing in his spirit; he felt something\ntake its flight from him, and something descend into him. Mysterious\nexchange of the abysses of the soul with the abysses of the universe!\n\nHe thought of the grandeur and presence of God; of the future eternity,\nthat strange mystery; of the eternity past, a mystery still more\nstrange; of all the infinities, which pierced their way into all his\nsenses, beneath his eyes; and, without seeking to comprehend the\nincomprehensible, he gazed upon it. He did not study God; he was\ndazzled by him. He considered those magnificent conjunctions of atoms,\nwhich communicate aspects to matter, reveal forces by verifying them,\ncreate individualities in unity, proportions in extent, the innumerable\nin the infinite, and, through light, produce beauty. These conjunctions\nare formed and dissolved incessantly; hence life and death.\n\nHe seated himself on a wooden bench, with his back against a decrepit\nvine; he gazed at the stars, past the puny and stunted silhouettes of\nhis fruit-trees. This quarter of an acre, so poorly planted, so\nencumbered with mean buildings and sheds, was dear to him, and\nsatisfied his wants.\n\nWhat more was needed by this old man, who divided the leisure of his\nlife, where there was so little leisure, between gardening in the\ndaytime and contemplation at night? Was not this narrow enclosure, with\nthe heavens for a ceiling, sufficient to enable him to adore God in his\nmost divine works, in turn? Does not this comprehend all, in fact? and\nwhat is there left to desire beyond it? A little garden in which to\nwalk, and immensity in which to dream. At one’s feet that which can be\ncultivated and plucked; over head that which one can study and meditate\nupon: some flowers on earth, and all the stars in the sky.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV—WHAT HE THOUGHT\n\n\nOne last word.\n\nSince this sort of details might, particularly at the present moment,\nand to use an expression now in fashion, give to the Bishop of D—— a\ncertain “pantheistical” physiognomy, and induce the belief, either to\nhis credit or discredit, that he entertained one of those personal\nphilosophies which are peculiar to our century, which sometimes spring\nup in solitary spirits, and there take on a form and grow until they\nusurp the place of religion, we insist upon it, that not one of those\npersons who knew Monseigneur Welcome would have thought himself\nauthorized to think anything of the sort. That which enlightened this\nman was his heart. His wisdom was made of the light which comes from\nthere.\n\nNo systems; many works. Abstruse speculations contain vertigo; no,\nthere is nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses.\nThe apostle may be daring, but the bishop must be timid. He would\nprobably have felt a scruple at sounding too far in advance certain\nproblems which are, in a manner, reserved for terrible great minds.\nThere is a sacred horror beneath the porches of the enigma; those\ngloomy openings stand yawning there, but something tells you, you, a\npasser-by in life, that you must not enter. Woe to him who penetrates\nthither!\n\nGeniuses in the impenetrable depths of abstraction and pure\nspeculation, situated, so to speak, above all dogmas, propose their\nideas to God. Their prayer audaciously offers discussion. Their\nadoration interrogates. This is direct religion, which is full of\nanxiety and responsibility for him who attempts its steep cliffs.\n\nHuman meditation has no limits. At his own risk and peril, it analyzes\nand digs deep into its own bedazzlement. One might almost say, that by\na sort of splendid reaction, it with it dazzles nature; the mysterious\nworld which surrounds us renders back what it has received; it is\nprobable that the contemplators are contemplated. However that may be,\nthere are on earth men who—are they men?—perceive distinctly at the\nverge of the horizons of reverie the heights of the absolute, and who\nhave the terrible vision of the infinite mountain. Monseigneur Welcome\nwas one of these men; Monseigneur Welcome was not a genius. He would\nhave feared those sublimities whence some very great men even, like\nSwedenborg and Pascal, have slipped into insanity. Certainly, these\npowerful reveries have their moral utility, and by these arduous paths\none approaches to ideal perfection. As for him, he took the path which\nshortens,—the Gospel’s.\n\nHe did not attempt to impart to his chasuble the folds of Elijah’s\nmantle; he projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell of\nevents; he did not see to condense in flame the light of things; he had\nnothing of the prophet and nothing of the magician about him. This\nhumble soul loved, and that was all.\n\nThat he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration is\nprobable: but one can no more pray too much than one can love too much;\nand if it is a heresy to pray beyond the texts, Saint Theresa and Saint\nJerome would be heretics.\n\nHe inclined towards all that groans and all that expiates. The universe\nappeared to him like an immense malady; everywhere he felt fever,\neverywhere he heard the sound of suffering, and, without seeking to\nsolve the enigma, he strove to dress the wound. The terrible spectacle\nof created things developed tenderness in him; he was occupied only in\nfinding for himself, and in inspiring others with the best way to\ncompassionate and relieve. That which exists was for this good and rare\npriest a permanent subject of sadness which sought consolation.\n\nThere are men who toil at extracting gold; he toiled at the extraction\nof pity. Universal misery was his mine. The sadness which reigned\neverywhere was but an excuse for unfailing kindness. _Love each other;_\nhe declared this to be complete, desired nothing further, and that was\nthe whole of his doctrine. One day, that man who believed himself to be\na “philosopher,” the senator who has already been alluded to, said to\nthe Bishop: “Just survey the spectacle of the world: all war against\nall; the strongest has the most wit. Your _love each other_ is\nnonsense.”—_“Well,”_ replied Monseigneur Welcome, without contesting\nthe point, _“if it is nonsense, the soul should shut itself up in it,\nas the pearl in the oyster.”_ Thus he shut himself up, he lived there,\nhe was absolutely satisfied with it, leaving on one side the prodigious\nquestions which attract and terrify, the fathomless perspectives of\nabstraction, the precipices of metaphysics—all those profundities which\nconverge, for the apostle in God, for the atheist in nothingness;\ndestiny, good and evil, the way of being against being, the conscience\nof man, the thoughtful somnambulism of the animal, the transformation\nin death, the recapitulation of existences which the tomb contains, the\nincomprehensible grafting of successive loves on the persistent _I_,\nthe essence, the substance, the Nile, and the Ens, the soul, nature,\nliberty, necessity; perpendicular problems, sinister obscurities, where\nlean the gigantic archangels of the human mind; formidable abysses,\nwhich Lucretius, Manou, Saint Paul, Dante, contemplate with eyes\nflashing lightning, which seems by its steady gaze on the infinite to\ncause stars to blaze forth there.\n\nMonseigneur Bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior of\nmysterious questions without scrutinizing them, and without troubling\nhis own mind with them, and who cherished in his own soul a grave\nrespect for darkness.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SECOND—THE FALL\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE EVENING OF A DAY OF WALKING\n\n\nEarly in the month of October, 1815, about an hour before sunset, a man\nwho was travelling on foot entered the little town of D—— The few\ninhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at the\nmoment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness. It was\ndifficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance. He was a\nman of medium stature, thickset and robust, in the prime of life. He\nmight have been forty-six or forty-eight years old. A cap with a\ndrooping leather visor partly concealed his face, burned and tanned by\nsun and wind, and dripping with perspiration. His shirt of coarse\nyellow linen, fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor, permitted\na view of his hairy breast: he had a cravat twisted into a string;\ntrousers of blue drilling, worn and threadbare, white on one knee and\ntorn on the other; an old gray, tattered blouse, patched on one of the\nelbows with a bit of green cloth sewed on with twine; a tightly packed\nsoldier knapsack, well buckled and perfectly new, on his back; an\nenormous, knotty stick in his hand; iron-shod shoes on his stockingless\nfeet; a shaved head and a long beard.\n\nThe sweat, the heat, the journey on foot, the dust, added I know not\nwhat sordid quality to this dilapidated whole. His hair was closely\ncut, yet bristling, for it had begun to grow a little, and did not seem\nto have been cut for some time.\n\nNo one knew him. He was evidently only a chance passer-by. Whence came\nhe? From the south; from the seashore, perhaps, for he made his\nentrance into D—— by the same street which, seven months previously,\nhad witnessed the passage of the Emperor Napoleon on his way from\nCannes to Paris. This man must have been walking all day. He seemed\nvery much fatigued. Some women of the ancient market town which is\nsituated below the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the\nboulevard Gassendi, and drink at the fountain which stands at the end\nof the promenade. He must have been very thirsty: for the children who\nfollowed him saw him stop again for a drink, two hundred paces further\non, at the fountain in the market-place.\n\nOn arriving at the corner of the Rue Poichevert, he turned to the left,\nand directed his steps toward the town-hall. He entered, then came out\na quarter of an hour later. A gendarme was seated near the door, on the\nstone bench which General Drouot had mounted on the 4th of March to\nread to the frightened throng of the inhabitants of D—— the\nproclamation of the Gulf Juan. The man pulled off his cap and humbly\nsaluted the gendarme.\n\nThe gendarme, without replying to his salute, stared attentively at\nhim, followed him for a while with his eyes, and then entered the\ntown-hall.\n\nThere then existed at D—— a fine inn at the sign of the _Cross of\nColbas_. This inn had for a landlord a certain Jacquin Labarre, a man\nof consideration in the town on account of his relationship to another\nLabarre, who kept the inn of the _Three Dauphins_ in Grenoble, and had\nserved in the Guides. At the time of the Emperor’s landing, many rumors\nhad circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of the\n_Three Dauphins_. It was said that General Bertrand, disguised as a\ncarter, had made frequent trips thither in the month of January, and\nthat he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls\nof gold to the citizens. The truth is, that when the Emperor entered\nGrenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the\nprefecture; he had thanked the mayor, saying, _“I am going to the house\nof a brave man of my acquaintance”;_ and he had betaken himself to the\n_Three Dauphins_. This glory of the Labarre of the _Three Dauphins_ was\nreflected upon the Labarre of the _Cross of Colbas_, at a distance of\nfive and twenty leagues. It was said of him in the town, _“That is the\ncousin of the man of Grenoble.”_\n\nThe man bent his steps towards this inn, which was the best in the\ncountry-side. He entered the kitchen, which opened on a level with the\nstreet. All the stoves were lighted; a huge fire blazed gayly in the\nfireplace. The host, who was also the chief cook, was going from one\nstew-pan to another, very busily superintending an excellent dinner\ndesigned for the wagoners, whose loud talking, conversation, and\nlaughter were audible from an adjoining apartment. Any one who has\ntravelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer than\nwagoners. A fat marmot, flanked by white partridges and heather-cocks,\nwas turning on a long spit before the fire; on the stove, two huge\ncarps from Lake Lauzet and a trout from Lake Alloz were cooking.\n\nThe host, hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter, said,\nwithout raising his eyes from his stoves:—\n\n“What do you wish, sir?”\n\n\n“Food and lodging,” said the man.\n\n“Nothing easier,” replied the host. At that moment he turned his head,\ntook in the traveller’s appearance with a single glance, and added, “By\npaying for it.”\n\n\nThe man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse, and\nanswered, “I have money.”\n\n\n“In that case, we are at your service,” said the host.\n\nThe man put his purse back in his pocket, removed his knapsack from his\nback, put it on the ground near the door, retained his stick in his\nhand, and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire. D—— is in\nthe mountains. The evenings are cold there in October.\n\nBut as the host went back and forth, he scrutinized the traveller.\n\n“Will dinner be ready soon?” said the man.\n\n“Immediately,” replied the landlord.\n\nWhile the newcomer was warming himself before the fire, with his back\nturned, the worthy host, Jacquin Labarre, drew a pencil from his\npocket, then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on\na small table near the window. On the white margin he wrote a line or\ntwo, folded it without sealing, and then intrusted this scrap of paper\nto a child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and\nlackey. The landlord whispered a word in the scullion’s ear, and the\nchild set off on a run in the direction of the town-hall.\n\nThe traveller saw nothing of all this.\n\nOnce more he inquired, “Will dinner be ready soon?”\n\n\n“Immediately,” responded the host.\n\nThe child returned. He brought back the paper. The host unfolded it\neagerly, like a person who is expecting a reply. He seemed to read it\nattentively, then tossed his head, and remained thoughtful for a\nmoment. Then he took a step in the direction of the traveller, who\nappeared to be immersed in reflections which were not very serene.\n\n“I cannot receive you, sir,” said he.\n\nThe man half rose.\n\n“What! Are you afraid that I will not pay you? Do you want me to pay\nyou in advance? I have money, I tell you.”\n\n\n“It is not that.”\n\n\n“What then?”\n\n\n“You have money—”\n\n\n“Yes,” said the man.\n\n“And I,” said the host, “have no room.”\n\n\nThe man resumed tranquilly, “Put me in the stable.”\n\n\n“I cannot.”\n\n\n“Why?”\n\n\n“The horses take up all the space.”\n\n\n“Very well!” retorted the man; “a corner of the loft then, a truss of\nstraw. We will see about that after dinner.”\n\n\n“I cannot give you any dinner.”\n\n\nThis declaration, made in a measured but firm tone, struck the stranger\nas grave. He rose.\n\n“Ah! bah! But I am dying of hunger. I have been walking since sunrise.\nI have travelled twelve leagues. I pay. I wish to eat.”\n\n\n“I have nothing,” said the landlord.\n\nThe man burst out laughing, and turned towards the fireplace and the\nstoves: “Nothing! and all that?”\n\n\n“All that is engaged.”\n\n\n“By whom?”\n\n\n“By messieurs the wagoners.”\n\n\n“How many are there of them?”\n\n\n“Twelve.”\n\n\n“There is enough food there for twenty.”\n\n\n“They have engaged the whole of it and paid for it in advance.”\n\n\nThe man seated himself again, and said, without raising his voice, “I\nam at an inn; I am hungry, and I shall remain.”\n\n\nThen the host bent down to his ear, and said in a tone which made him\nstart, “Go away!”\n\n\nAt that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some\nbrands into the fire with the iron-shod tip of his staff; he turned\nquickly round, and as he opened his mouth to reply, the host gazed\nsteadily at him and added, still in a low voice: “Stop! there’s enough\nof that sort of talk. Do you want me to tell you your name? Your name\nis Jean Valjean. Now do you want me to tell you who you are? When I saw\nyou come in I suspected something; I sent to the town-hall, and this\nwas the reply that was sent to me. Can you read?”\n\n\nSo saying, he held out to the stranger, fully unfolded, the paper which\nhad just travelled from the inn to the town-hall, and from the\ntown-hall to the inn. The man cast a glance upon it. The landlord\nresumed after a pause.\n\n“I am in the habit of being polite to every one. Go away!”\n\n\nThe man dropped his head, picked up the knapsack which he had deposited\non the ground, and took his departure.\n\nHe chose the principal street. He walked straight on at a venture,\nkeeping close to the houses like a sad and humiliated man. He did not\nturn round a single time. Had he done so, he would have seen the host\nof the _Cross of Colbas_ standing on his threshold, surrounded by all\nthe guests of his inn, and all the passers-by in the street, talking\nvivaciously, and pointing him out with his finger; and, from the\nglances of terror and distrust cast by the group, he might have divined\nthat his arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town.\n\nHe saw nothing of all this. People who are crushed do not look behind\nthem. They know but too well the evil fate which follows them.\n\nThus he proceeded for some time, walking on without ceasing, traversing\nat random streets of which he knew nothing, forgetful of his fatigue,\nas is often the case when a man is sad. All at once he felt the pangs\nof hunger sharply. Night was drawing near. He glanced about him, to see\nwhether he could not discover some shelter.\n\nThe fine hostelry was closed to him; he was seeking some very humble\npublic house, some hovel, however lowly.\n\nJust then a light flashed up at the end of the streets; a pine branch\nsuspended from a cross-beam of iron was outlined against the white sky\nof the twilight. He proceeded thither.\n\nIt proved to be, in fact, a public house. The public house which is in\nthe Rue de Chaffaut.\n\nThe wayfarer halted for a moment, and peeped through the window into\nthe interior of the low-studded room of the public house, illuminated\nby a small lamp on a table and by a large fire on the hearth. Some men\nwere engaged in drinking there. The landlord was warming himself. An\niron pot, suspended from a crane, bubbled over the flame.\n\nThe entrance to this public house, which is also a sort of an inn, is\nby two doors. One opens on the street, the other upon a small yard\nfilled with manure. The traveller dare not enter by the street door. He\nslipped into the yard, halted again, then raised the latch timidly and\nopened the door.\n\n“Who goes there?” said the master.\n\n“Some one who wants supper and bed.”\n\n\n“Good. We furnish supper and bed here.”\n\n\nHe entered. All the men who were drinking turned round. The lamp\nilluminated him on one side, the firelight on the other. They examined\nhim for some time while he was taking off his knapsack.\n\nThe host said to him, “There is the fire. The supper is cooking in the\npot. Come and warm yourself, comrade.”\n\n\nHe approached and seated himself near the hearth. He stretched out his\nfeet, which were exhausted with fatigue, to the fire; a fine odor was\nemitted by the pot. All that could be distinguished of his face,\nbeneath his cap, which was well pulled down, assumed a vague appearance\nof comfort, mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual\nsuffering bestows.\n\nIt was, moreover, a firm, energetic, and melancholy profile. This\nphysiognomy was strangely composed; it began by seeming humble, and\nended by seeming severe. The eye shone beneath its lashes like a fire\nbeneath brushwood.\n\nOne of the men seated at the table, however, was a fishmonger who,\nbefore entering the public house of the Rue de Chaffaut, had been to\nstable his horse at Labarre’s. It chanced that he had that very morning\nencountered this unprepossessing stranger on the road between Bras\nd’Asse and—I have forgotten the name. I think it was Escoublon. Now,\nwhen he met him, the man, who then seemed already extremely weary, had\nrequested him to take him on his crupper; to which the fishmonger had\nmade no reply except by redoubling his gait. This fishmonger had been a\nmember half an hour previously of the group which surrounded Jacquin\nLabarre, and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the\nmorning to the people at the _Cross of Colbas_. From where he sat he\nmade an imperceptible sign to the tavern-keeper. The tavern-keeper went\nto him. They exchanged a few words in a low tone. The man had again\nbecome absorbed in his reflections.\n\nThe tavern-keeper returned to the fireplace, laid his hand abruptly on\nthe shoulder of the man, and said to him:—\n\n“You are going to get out of here.”\n\n\nThe stranger turned round and replied gently, “Ah! You know?—”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“I was sent away from the other inn.”\n\n\n“And you are to be turned out of this one.”\n\n\n“Where would you have me go?”\n\n\n“Elsewhere.”\n\n\nThe man took his stick and his knapsack and departed.\n\nAs he went out, some children who had followed him from the _Cross of\nColbas_, and who seemed to be lying in wait for him, threw stones at\nhim. He retraced his steps in anger, and threatened them with his\nstick: the children dispersed like a flock of birds.\n\nHe passed before the prison. At the door hung an iron chain attached to\na bell. He rang.\n\nThe wicket opened.\n\n“Turnkey,” said he, removing his cap politely, “will you have the\nkindness to admit me, and give me a lodging for the night?”\n\n\nA voice replied:—\n\n“The prison is not an inn. Get yourself arrested, and you will be\nadmitted.”\n\n\nThe wicket closed again.\n\nHe entered a little street in which there were many gardens. Some of\nthem are enclosed only by hedges, which lends a cheerful aspect to the\nstreet. In the midst of these gardens and hedges he caught sight of a\nsmall house of a single story, the window of which was lighted up. He\npeered through the pane as he had done at the public house. Within was\na large whitewashed room, with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff,\nand a cradle in one corner, a few wooden chairs, and a double-barrelled\ngun hanging on the wall. A table was spread in the centre of the room.\nA copper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen, the\npewter jug shining like silver, and filled with wine, and the brown,\nsmoking soup-tureen. At this table sat a man of about forty, with a\nmerry and open countenance, who was dandling a little child on his\nknees. Close by a very young woman was nursing another child. The\nfather was laughing, the child was laughing, the mother was smiling.\n\nThe stranger paused a moment in reverie before this tender and calming\nspectacle. What was taking place within him? He alone could have told.\nIt is probable that he thought that this joyous house would be\nhospitable, and that, in a place where he beheld so much happiness, he\nwould find perhaps a little pity.\n\nHe tapped on the pane with a very small and feeble knock.\n\nThey did not hear him.\n\nHe tapped again.\n\nHe heard the woman say, “It seems to me, husband, that some one is\nknocking.”\n\n\n“No,” replied the husband.\n\nHe tapped a third time.\n\nThe husband rose, took the lamp, and went to the door, which he opened.\n\nHe was a man of lofty stature, half peasant, half artisan. He wore a\nhuge leather apron, which reached to his left shoulder, and which a\nhammer, a red handkerchief, a powder-horn, and all sorts of objects\nwhich were upheld by the girdle, as in a pocket, caused to bulge out.\nHe carried his head thrown backwards; his shirt, widely opened and\nturned back, displayed his bull neck, white and bare. He had thick\neyelashes, enormous black whiskers, prominent eyes, the lower part of\nhis face like a snout; and besides all this, that air of being on his\nown ground, which is indescribable.\n\n“Pardon me, sir,” said the wayfarer, “Could you, in consideration of\npayment, give me a plate of soup and a corner of that shed yonder in\nthe garden, in which to sleep? Tell me; can you? For money?”\n\n\n“Who are you?” demanded the master of the house.\n\nThe man replied: “I have just come from Puy-Moisson. I have walked all\nday long. I have travelled twelve leagues. Can you?—if I pay?”\n\n\n“I would not refuse,” said the peasant, “to lodge any respectable man\nwho would pay me. But why do you not go to the inn?”\n\n\n“There is no room.”\n\n\n“Bah! Impossible. This is neither a fair nor a market day. Have you\nbeen to Labarre?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Well?”\n\n\nThe traveller replied with embarrassment: “I do not know. He did not\nreceive me.”\n\n\n“Have you been to What’s-his-name’s, in the Rue Chaffaut?”\n\n\nThe stranger’s embarrassment increased; he stammered, “He did not\nreceive me either.”\n\n\nThe peasant’s countenance assumed an expression of distrust; he\nsurveyed the newcomer from head to feet, and suddenly exclaimed, with a\nsort of shudder:—\n\n“Are you the man?—”\n\n\nHe cast a fresh glance upon the stranger, took three steps backwards,\nplaced the lamp on the table, and took his gun down from the wall.\n\nMeanwhile, at the words, _Are you the man?_ the woman had risen, had\nclasped her two children in her arms, and had taken refuge\nprecipitately behind her husband, staring in terror at the stranger,\nwith her bosom uncovered, and with frightened eyes, as she murmured in\na low tone, _“Tso-maraude.”_1\n\nAll this took place in less time than it requires to picture it to\none’s self. After having scrutinized the man for several moments, as\none scrutinizes a viper, the master of the house returned to the door\nand said:—\n\n“Clear out!”\n\n\n“For pity’s sake, a glass of water,” said the man.\n\n“A shot from my gun!” said the peasant.\n\nThen he closed the door violently, and the man heard him shoot two\nlarge bolts. A moment later, the window-shutter was closed, and the\nsound of a bar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside.\n\nNight continued to fall. A cold wind from the Alps was blowing. By the\nlight of the expiring day the stranger perceived, in one of the gardens\nwhich bordered the street, a sort of hut, which seemed to him to be\nbuilt of sods. He climbed over the wooden fence resolutely, and found\nhimself in the garden. He approached the hut; its door consisted of a\nvery low and narrow aperture, and it resembled those buildings which\nroad-laborers construct for themselves along the roads. He thought\nwithout doubt, that it was, in fact, the dwelling of a road-laborer; he\nwas suffering from cold and hunger, but this was, at least, a shelter\nfrom the cold. This sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night.\nHe threw himself flat on his face, and crawled into the hut. It was\nwarm there, and he found a tolerably good bed of straw. He lay, for a\nmoment, stretched out on this bed, without the power to make a\nmovement, so fatigued was he. Then, as the knapsack on his back was in\nhis way, and as it furnished, moreover, a pillow ready to his hand, he\nset about unbuckling one of the straps. At that moment, a ferocious\ngrowl became audible. He raised his eyes. The head of an enormous dog\nwas outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut.\n\nIt was a dog’s kennel.\n\nHe was himself vigorous and formidable; he armed himself with his\nstaff, made a shield of his knapsack, and made his way out of the\nkennel in the best way he could, not without enlarging the rents in his\nrags.\n\nHe left the garden in the same manner, but backwards, being obliged, in\norder to keep the dog respectful, to have recourse to that manœuvre\nwith his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as _la\nrose couverte_.\n\nWhen he had, not without difficulty, repassed the fence, and found\nhimself once more in the street, alone, without refuge, without\nshelter, without a roof over his head, chased even from that bed of\nstraw and from that miserable kennel, he dropped rather than seated\nhimself on a stone, and it appears that a passer-by heard him exclaim,\n“I am not even a dog!”\n\n\nHe soon rose again and resumed his march. He went out of the town,\nhoping to find some tree or haystack in the fields which would afford\nhim shelter.\n\nHe walked thus for some time, with his head still drooping. When he\nfelt himself far from every human habitation, he raised his eyes and\ngazed searchingly about him. He was in a field. Before him was one of\nthose low hills covered with close-cut stubble, which, after the\nharvest, resemble shaved heads.\n\nThe horizon was perfectly black. This was not alone the obscurity of\nnight; it was caused by very low-hanging clouds which seemed to rest\nupon the hill itself, and which were mounting and filling the whole\nsky. Meanwhile, as the moon was about to rise, and as there was still\nfloating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight, these\nclouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch, whence a\ngleam of light fell upon the earth.\n\nThe earth was thus better lighted than the sky, which produces a\nparticularly sinister effect, and the hill, whose contour was poor and\nmean, was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon. The whole\neffect was hideous, petty, lugubrious, and narrow.\n\nThere was nothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree,\nwhich writhed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer.\n\nThis man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits of\nintelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysterious\naspects of things; nevertheless, there was something in that sky, in\nthat hill, in that plain, in that tree, which was so profoundly\ndesolate, that after a moment of immobility and reverie he turned back\nabruptly. There are instants when nature seems hostile.\n\nHe retraced his steps; the gates of D—— were closed. D——, which had\nsustained sieges during the wars of religion, was still surrounded in\n1815 by ancient walls flanked by square towers which have been\ndemolished since. He passed through a breach and entered the town\nagain.\n\nIt might have been eight o’clock in the evening. As he was not\nacquainted with the streets, he recommenced his walk at random.\n\nIn this way he came to the prefecture, then to the seminary. As he\npassed through the Cathedral Square, he shook his fist at the church.\n\nAt the corner of this square there is a printing establishment. It is\nthere that the proclamations of the Emperor and of the Imperial Guard\nto the army, brought from the Island of Elba and dictated by Napoleon\nhimself, were printed for the first time.\n\nWorn out with fatigue, and no longer entertaining any hope, he lay down\non a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office.\n\nAt that moment an old woman came out of the church. She saw the man\nstretched out in the shadow. “What are you doing there, my friend?”\nsaid she.\n\nHe answered harshly and angrily: “As you see, my good woman, I am\nsleeping.” The good woman, who was well worthy the name, in fact, was\nthe Marquise de R——\n\n“On this bench?” she went on.\n\n“I have had a mattress of wood for nineteen years,” said the man;\n“to-day I have a mattress of stone.”\n\n\n“You have been a soldier?”\n\n\n“Yes, my good woman, a soldier.”\n\n\n“Why do you not go to the inn?”\n\n\n“Because I have no money.”\n\n\n“Alas!” said Madame de R——, “I have only four sous in my purse.”\n\n\n“Give it to me all the same.”\n\n\nThe man took the four sous. Madame de R—— continued: “You cannot obtain\nlodgings in an inn for so small a sum. But have you tried? It is\nimpossible for you to pass the night thus. You are cold and hungry, no\ndoubt. Some one might have given you a lodging out of charity.”\n\n\n“I have knocked at all doors.”\n\n\n“Well?”\n\n\n“I have been driven away everywhere.”\n\n\nThe “good woman” touched the man’s arm, and pointed out to him on the\nother side of the street a small, low house, which stood beside the\nBishop’s palace.\n\n“You have knocked at all doors?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Have you knocked at that one?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“Knock there.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—PRUDENCE COUNSELLED TO WISDOM.\n\n\nThat evening, the Bishop of D——, after his promenade through the town,\nremained shut up rather late in his room. He was busy over a great work\non _Duties_, which was never completed, unfortunately. He was carefully\ncompiling everything that the Fathers and the doctors have said on this\nimportant subject. His book was divided into two parts: firstly, the\nduties of all; secondly, the duties of each individual, according to\nthe class to which he belongs. The duties of all are the great duties.\nThere are four of these. Saint Matthew points them out: duties towards\nGod (_Matt._ vi.); duties towards one’s self (_Matt._ v. 29, 30);\nduties towards one’s neighbor (_Matt._ vii. 12); duties towards animals\n(_Matt._ vi. 20, 25). As for the other duties the Bishop found them\npointed out and prescribed elsewhere: to sovereigns and subjects, in\nthe Epistle to the Romans; to magistrates, to wives, to mothers, to\nyoung men, by Saint Peter; to husbands, fathers, children and servants,\nin the Epistle to the Ephesians; to the faithful, in the Epistle to the\nHebrews; to virgins, in the Epistle to the Corinthians. Out of these\nprecepts he was laboriously constructing a harmonious whole, which he\ndesired to present to souls.\n\nAt eight o’clock he was still at work, writing with a good deal of\ninconvenience upon little squares of paper, with a big book open on his\nknees, when Madame Magloire entered, according to her wont, to get the\nsilver-ware from the cupboard near his bed. A moment later, the Bishop,\nknowing that the table was set, and that his sister was probably\nwaiting for him, shut his book, rose from his table, and entered the\ndining-room.\n\nThe dining-room was an oblong apartment, with a fireplace, which had a\ndoor opening on the street (as we have said), and a window opening on\nthe garden.\n\nMadame Magloire was, in fact, just putting the last touches to the\ntable.\n\nAs she performed this service, she was conversing with Mademoiselle\nBaptistine.\n\nA lamp stood on the table; the table was near the fireplace. A wood\nfire was burning there.\n\nOne can easily picture to one’s self these two women, both of whom were\nover sixty years of age. Madame Magloire small, plump, vivacious;\nMademoiselle Baptistine gentle, slender, frail, somewhat taller than\nher brother, dressed in a gown of puce-colored silk, of the fashion of\n1806, which she had purchased at that date in Paris, and which had\nlasted ever since. To borrow vulgar phrases, which possess the merit of\ngiving utterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would\nhardly suffice to express, Madame Magloire had the air of a _peasant_,\nand Mademoiselle Baptistine that of a _lady_. Madame Magloire wore a\nwhite quilted cap, a gold Jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her\nneck, the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house, a\nvery white fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff,\nwith large, short sleeves, an apron of cotton cloth in red and green\nchecks, knotted round the waist with a green ribbon, with a stomacher\nof the same attached by two pins at the upper corners, coarse shoes on\nher feet, and yellow stockings, like the women of Marseilles.\nMademoiselle Baptistine’s gown was cut on the patterns of 1806, with a\nshort waist, a narrow, sheath-like skirt, puffed sleeves, with flaps\nand buttons. She concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as\nthe _baby_ wig. Madame Magloire had an intelligent, vivacious, and\nkindly air; the two corners of her mouth unequally raised, and her\nupper lip, which was larger than the lower, imparted to her a rather\ncrabbed and imperious look. So long as Monseigneur held his peace, she\ntalked to him resolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom; but as\nsoon as Monseigneur began to speak, as we have seen, she obeyed\npassively like her mistress. Mademoiselle Baptistine did not even\nspeak. She confined herself to obeying and pleasing him. She had never\nbeen pretty, even when she was young; she had large, blue, prominent\neyes, and a long arched nose; but her whole visage, her whole person,\nbreathed forth an ineffable goodness, as we stated in the beginning.\nShe had always been predestined to gentleness; but faith, charity,\nhope, those three virtues which mildly warm the soul, had gradually\nelevated that gentleness to sanctity. Nature had made her a lamb,\nreligion had made her an angel. Poor sainted virgin! Sweet memory which\nhas vanished!\n\nMademoiselle Baptistine has so often narrated what passed at the\nepiscopal residence that evening, that there are many people now living\nwho still recall the most minute details.\n\nAt the moment when the Bishop entered, Madame Magloire was talking with\nconsiderable vivacity. She was haranguing Mademoiselle Baptistine on a\nsubject which was familiar to her and to which the Bishop was also\naccustomed. The question concerned the lock upon the entrance door.\n\nIt appears that while procuring some provisions for supper, Madame\nMagloire had heard things in divers places. People had spoken of a\nprowler of evil appearance; a suspicious vagabond had arrived who must\nbe somewhere about the town, and those who should take it into their\nheads to return home late that night might be subjected to unpleasant\nencounters. The police was very badly organized, moreover, because\nthere was no love lost between the Prefect and the Mayor, who sought to\ninjure each other by making things happen. It behooved wise people to\nplay the part of their own police, and to guard themselves well, and\ncare must be taken to duly close, bar and barricade their houses, and\nto _fasten the doors well_.\n\nMadame Magloire emphasized these last words; but the Bishop had just\ncome from his room, where it was rather cold. He seated himself in\nfront of the fire, and warmed himself, and then fell to thinking of\nother things. He did not take up the remark dropped with design by\nMadame Magloire. She repeated it. Then Mademoiselle Baptistine,\ndesirous of satisfying Madame Magloire without displeasing her brother,\nventured to say timidly:—\n\n“Did you hear what Madame Magloire is saying, brother?”\n\n\n“I have heard something of it in a vague way,” replied the Bishop. Then\nhalf-turning in his chair, placing his hands on his knees, and raising\ntowards the old servant woman his cordial face, which so easily grew\njoyous, and which was illuminated from below by the firelight,—“Come,\nwhat is the matter? What is the matter? Are we in any great danger?”\n\n\nThen Madame Magloire began the whole story afresh, exaggerating it a\nlittle without being aware of the fact. It appeared that a Bohemian, a\nbare-footed vagabond, a sort of dangerous mendicant, was at that moment\nin the town. He had presented himself at Jacquin Labarre’s to obtain\nlodgings, but the latter had not been willing to take him in. He had\nbeen seen to arrive by the way of the boulevard Gassendi and roam about\nthe streets in the gloaming. A gallows-bird with a terrible face.\n\n“Really!” said the Bishop.\n\nThis willingness to interrogate encouraged Madame Magloire; it seemed\nto her to indicate that the Bishop was on the point of becoming\nalarmed; she pursued triumphantly:—\n\n“Yes, Monseigneur. That is how it is. There will be some sort of\ncatastrophe in this town to-night. Every one says so. And withal, the\npolice is so badly regulated” (a useful repetition). “The idea of\nliving in a mountainous country, and not even having lights in the\nstreets at night! One goes out. Black as ovens, indeed! And I say,\nMonseigneur, and Mademoiselle there says with me—”\n\n\n“I,” interrupted his sister, “say nothing. What my brother does is well\ndone.”\n\n\nMadame Magloire continued as though there had been no protest:—\n\n“We say that this house is not safe at all; that if Monseigneur will\npermit, I will go and tell Paulin Musebois, the locksmith, to come and\nreplace the ancient locks on the doors; we have them, and it is only\nthe work of a moment; for I say that nothing is more terrible than a\ndoor which can be opened from the outside with a latch by the first\npasser-by; and I say that we need bolts, Monseigneur, if only for this\nnight; moreover, Monseigneur has the habit of always saying ‘come in’;\nand besides, even in the middle of the night, O mon Dieu! there is no\nneed to ask permission.”\n\n\nAt that moment there came a tolerably violent knock on the door.\n\n“Come in,” said the Bishop.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—THE HEROISM OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE.\n\n\nThe door opened.\n\nIt opened wide with a rapid movement, as though some one had given it\nan energetic and resolute push.\n\nA man entered.\n\nWe already know the man. It was the wayfarer whom we have seen\nwandering about in search of shelter.\n\nHe entered, advanced a step, and halted, leaving the door open behind\nhim. He had his knapsack on his shoulders, his cudgel in his hand, a\nrough, audacious, weary, and violent expression in his eyes. The fire\non the hearth lighted him up. He was hideous. It was a sinister\napparition.\n\nMadame Magloire had not even the strength to utter a cry. She trembled,\nand stood with her mouth wide open.\n\nMademoiselle Baptistine turned round, beheld the man entering, and half\nstarted up in terror; then, turning her head by degrees towards the\nfireplace again, she began to observe her brother, and her face became\nonce more profoundly calm and serene.\n\nThe Bishop fixed a tranquil eye on the man.\n\nAs he opened his mouth, doubtless to ask the newcomer what he desired,\nthe man rested both hands on his staff, directed his gaze at the old\nman and the two women, and without waiting for the Bishop to speak, he\nsaid, in a loud voice:—\n\n“See here. My name is Jean Valjean. I am a convict from the galleys. I\nhave passed nineteen years in the galleys. I was liberated four days\nago, and am on my way to Pontarlier, which is my destination. I have\nbeen walking for four days since I left Toulon. I have travelled a\ndozen leagues to-day on foot. This evening, when I arrived in these\nparts, I went to an inn, and they turned me out, because of my yellow\npassport, which I had shown at the town-hall. I had to do it. I went to\nan inn. They said to me, ‘Be off,’ at both places. No one would take\nme. I went to the prison; the jailer would not admit me. I went into a\ndog’s kennel; the dog bit me and chased me off, as though he had been a\nman. One would have said that he knew who I was. I went into the\nfields, intending to sleep in the open air, beneath the stars. There\nwere no stars. I thought it was going to rain, and I re-entered the\ntown, to seek the recess of a doorway. Yonder, in the square, I meant\nto sleep on a stone bench. A good woman pointed out your house to me,\nand said to me, ‘Knock there!’ I have knocked. What is this place? Do\nyou keep an inn? I have money—savings. One hundred and nine francs\nfifteen sous, which I earned in the galleys by my labor, in the course\nof nineteen years. I will pay. What is that to me? I have money. I am\nvery weary; twelve leagues on foot; I am very hungry. Are you willing\nthat I should remain?”\n\n\n“Madame Magloire,” said the Bishop, “you will set another place.”\n\n\nThe man advanced three paces, and approached the lamp which was on the\ntable. “Stop,” he resumed, as though he had not quite understood;\n“that’s not it. Did you hear? I am a galley-slave; a convict. I come\nfrom the galleys.” He drew from his pocket a large sheet of yellow\npaper, which he unfolded. “Here’s my passport. Yellow, as you see. This\nserves to expel me from every place where I go. Will you read it? I\nknow how to read. I learned in the galleys. There is a school there for\nthose who choose to learn. Hold, this is what they put on this\npassport: ‘Jean Valjean, discharged convict, native of’—that is nothing\nto you—‘has been nineteen years in the galleys: five years for\nhouse-breaking and burglary; fourteen years for having attempted to\nescape on four occasions. He is a very dangerous man.’ There! Every one\nhas cast me out. Are you willing to receive me? Is this an inn? Will\nyou give me something to eat and a bed? Have you a stable?”\n\n\n“Madame Magloire,” said the Bishop, “you will put white sheets on the\nbed in the alcove.” We have already explained the character of the two\nwomen’s obedience.\n\nMadame Magloire retired to execute these orders.\n\nThe Bishop turned to the man.\n\n“Sit down, sir, and warm yourself. We are going to sup in a few\nmoments, and your bed will be prepared while you are supping.”\n\n\nAt this point the man suddenly comprehended. The expression of his\nface, up to that time sombre and harsh, bore the imprint of\nstupefaction, of doubt, of joy, and became extraordinary. He began\nstammering like a crazy man:—\n\n“Really? What! You will keep me? You do not drive me forth? A convict!\nYou call me _sir!_ You do not address me as _thou?_ ‘Get out of here,\nyou dog!’ is what people always say to me. I felt sure that you would\nexpel me, so I told you at once who I am. Oh, what a good woman that\nwas who directed me hither! I am going to sup! A bed with a mattress\nand sheets, like the rest of the world! a bed! It is nineteen years\nsince I have slept in a bed! You actually do not want me to go! You are\ngood people. Besides, I have money. I will pay well. Pardon me,\nmonsieur the inn-keeper, but what is your name? I will pay anything you\nask. You are a fine man. You are an inn-keeper, are you not?”\n\n\n“I am,” replied the Bishop, “a priest who lives here.”\n\n\n“A priest!” said the man. “Oh, what a fine priest! Then you are not\ngoing to demand any money of me? You are the curé, are you not? the\ncuré of this big church? Well! I am a fool, truly! I had not perceived\nyour skull-cap.”\n\n\nAs he spoke, he deposited his knapsack and his cudgel in a corner,\nreplaced his passport in his pocket, and seated himself. Mademoiselle\nBaptistine gazed mildly at him. He continued:\n\n“You are humane, Monsieur le Curé; you have not scorned me. A good\npriest is a very good thing. Then you do not require me to pay?”\n\n\n“No,” said the Bishop; “keep your money. How much have you? Did you not\ntell me one hundred and nine francs?”\n\n\n“And fifteen sous,” added the man.\n\n“One hundred and nine francs fifteen sous. And how long did it take you\nto earn that?”\n\n\n“Nineteen years.”\n\n\n“Nineteen years!”\n\n\nThe Bishop sighed deeply.\n\nThe man continued: “I have still the whole of my money. In four days I\nhave spent only twenty-five sous, which I earned by helping unload some\nwagons at Grasse. Since you are an abbé, I will tell you that we had a\nchaplain in the galleys. And one day I saw a bishop there. Monseigneur\nis what they call him. He was the Bishop of Majore at Marseilles. He is\nthe curé who rules over the other curés, you understand. Pardon me, I\nsay that very badly; but it is such a far-off thing to me! You\nunderstand what we are! He said mass in the middle of the galleys, on\nan altar. He had a pointed thing, made of gold, on his head; it\nglittered in the bright light of midday. We were all ranged in lines on\nthe three sides, with cannons with lighted matches facing us. We could\nnot see very well. He spoke; but he was too far off, and we did not\nhear. That is what a bishop is like.”\n\n\nWhile he was speaking, the Bishop had gone and shut the door, which had\nremained wide open.\n\nMadame Magloire returned. She brought a silver fork and spoon, which\nshe placed on the table.\n\n“Madame Magloire,” said the Bishop, “place those things as near the\nfire as possible.” And turning to his guest: “The night wind is harsh\non the Alps. You must be cold, sir.”\n\n\nEach time that he uttered the word _sir_, in his voice which was so\ngently grave and polished, the man’s face lighted up. _Monsieur_ to a\nconvict is like a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the\n_Medusa_. Ignominy thirsts for consideration.\n\n“This lamp gives a very bad light,” said the Bishop.\n\nMadame Magloire understood him, and went to get the two silver\ncandlesticks from the chimney-piece in Monseigneur’s bed-chamber, and\nplaced them, lighted, on the table.\n\n“Monsieur le Curé,” said the man, “you are good; you do not despise me.\nYou receive me into your house. You light your candles for me. Yet I\nhave not concealed from you whence I come and that I am an unfortunate\nman.”\n\n\nThe Bishop, who was sitting close to him, gently touched his hand. “You\ncould not help telling me who you were. This is not my house; it is the\nhouse of Jesus Christ. This door does not demand of him who enters\nwhether he has a name, but whether he has a grief. You suffer, you are\nhungry and thirsty; you are welcome. And do not thank me; do not say\nthat I receive you in my house. No one is at home here, except the man\nwho needs a refuge. I say to you, who are passing by, that you are much\nmore at home here than I am myself. Everything here is yours. What need\nhave I to know your name? Besides, before you told me you had one which\nI knew.”\n\n\nThe man opened his eyes in astonishment.\n\n“Really? You knew what I was called?”\n\n\n“Yes,” replied the Bishop, “you are called my brother.”\n\n\n“Stop, Monsieur le Curé,” exclaimed the man. “I was very hungry when I\nentered here; but you are so good, that I no longer know what has\nhappened to me.”\n\n\nThe Bishop looked at him, and said,—\n\n“You have suffered much?”\n\n\n“Oh, the red coat, the ball on the ankle, a plank to sleep on, heat,\ncold, toil, the convicts, the thrashings, the double chain for nothing,\nthe cell for one word; even sick and in bed, still the chain! Dogs,\ndogs are happier! Nineteen years! I am forty-six. Now there is the\nyellow passport. That is what it is like.”\n\n\n“Yes,” resumed the Bishop, “you have come from a very sad place.\nListen. There will be more joy in heaven over the tear-bathed face of a\nrepentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men. If\nyou emerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath\nagainst mankind, you are deserving of pity; if you emerge with thoughts\nof good-will and of peace, you are more worthy than any one of us.”\n\n\nIn the meantime, Madame Magloire had served supper: soup, made with\nwater, oil, bread, and salt; a little bacon, a bit of mutton, figs, a\nfresh cheese, and a large loaf of rye bread. She had, of her own\naccord, added to the Bishop’s ordinary fare a bottle of his old Mauves\nwine.\n\nThe Bishop’s face at once assumed that expression of gayety which is\npeculiar to hospitable natures. “To table!” he cried vivaciously. As\nwas his custom when a stranger supped with him, he made the man sit on\nhis right. Mademoiselle Baptistine, perfectly peaceable and natural,\ntook her seat at his left.\n\nThe Bishop asked a blessing; then helped the soup himself, according to\nhis custom. The man began to eat with avidity.\n\nAll at once the Bishop said: “It strikes me there is something missing\non this table.”\n\n\nMadame Magloire had, in fact, only placed the three sets of forks and\nspoons which were absolutely necessary. Now, it was the usage of the\nhouse, when the Bishop had any one to supper, to lay out the whole six\nsets of silver on the table-cloth—an innocent ostentation. This\ngraceful semblance of luxury was a kind of child’s play, which was full\nof charm in that gentle and severe household, which raised poverty into\ndignity.\n\nMadame Magloire understood the remark, went out without saying a word,\nand a moment later the three sets of silver forks and spoons demanded\nby the Bishop were glittering upon the cloth, symmetrically arranged\nbefore the three persons seated at the table.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—DETAILS CONCERNING THE CHEESE-DAIRIES OF PONTARLIER.\n\n\nNow, in order to convey an idea of what passed at that table, we cannot\ndo better than to transcribe here a passage from one of Mademoiselle\nBaptistine’s letters to Madame Boischevron, wherein the conversation\nbetween the convict and the Bishop is described with ingenious\nminuteness.\n\n“. . . This man paid no attention to any one. He ate with the voracity\nof a starving man. However, after supper he said:\n\n“‘Monsieur le Curé of the good God, all this is far too good for me;\nbut I must say that the carters who would not allow me to eat with them\nkeep a better table than you do.’\n\n“Between ourselves, the remark rather shocked me. My brother replied:—\n\n“‘They are more fatigued than I.’\n\n“‘No,’ returned the man, ‘they have more money. You are poor; I see\nthat plainly. You cannot be even a curate. Are you really a curé? Ah,\nif the good God were but just, you certainly ought to be a curé!’\n\n“‘The good God is more than just,’ said my brother.\n\n“A moment later he added:—\n\n“‘Monsieur Jean Valjean, is it to Pontarlier that you are going?’\n\n“‘With my road marked out for me.’\n\n“I think that is what the man said. Then he went on:—\n\n“‘I must be on my way by daybreak to-morrow. Travelling is hard. If the\nnights are cold, the days are hot.’\n\n“‘You are going to a good country,’ said my brother. ‘During the\nRevolution my family was ruined. I took refuge in Franche-Comté at\nfirst, and there I lived for some time by the toil of my hands. My will\nwas good. I found plenty to occupy me. One has only to choose. There\nare paper mills, tanneries, distilleries, oil factories, watch\nfactories on a large scale, steel mills, copper works, twenty iron\nfoundries at least, four of which, situated at Lods, at Châtillon, at\nAudincourt, and at Beure, are tolerably large.’\n\n“I think I am not mistaken in saying that those are the names which my\nbrother mentioned. Then he interrupted himself and addressed me:—\n\n“‘Have we not some relatives in those parts, my dear sister?’\n\n“I replied,—\n\n“‘We did have some; among others, M. de Lucenet, who was captain of the\ngates at Pontarlier under the old régime.’\n\n“‘Yes,’ resumed my brother; ‘but in ’93, one had no longer any\nrelatives, one had only one’s arms. I worked. They have, in the country\nof Pontarlier, whither you are going, Monsieur Valjean, a truly\npatriarchal and truly charming industry, my sister. It is their\ncheese-dairies, which they call _fruitières_.’\n\n“Then my brother, while urging the man to eat, explained to him, with\ngreat minuteness, what these _fruitières_ of Pontarlier were; that they\nwere divided into two classes: the _big barns_ which belong to the\nrich, and where there are forty or fifty cows which produce from seven\nto eight thousand cheeses each summer, and the _associated fruitières_,\nwhich belong to the poor; these are the peasants of mid-mountain, who\nhold their cows in common, and share the proceeds. ‘They engage the\nservices of a cheese-maker, whom they call the _grurin_; the _grurin_\nreceives the milk of the associates three times a day, and marks the\nquantity on a double tally. It is towards the end of April that the\nwork of the cheese-dairies begins; it is towards the middle of June\nthat the cheese-makers drive their cows to the mountains.’\n\n“The man recovered his animation as he ate. My brother made him drink\nthat good Mauves wine, which he does not drink himself, because he says\nthat wine is expensive. My brother imparted all these details with that\neasy gayety of his with which you are acquainted, interspersing his\nwords with graceful attentions to me. He recurred frequently to that\ncomfortable trade of _grurin_, as though he wished the man to\nunderstand, without advising him directly and harshly, that this would\nafford him a refuge. One thing struck me. This man was what I have told\nyou. Well, neither during supper, nor during the entire evening, did my\nbrother utter a single word, with the exception of a few words about\nJesus when he entered, which could remind the man of what he was, nor\nof what my brother was. To all appearances, it was an occasion for\npreaching him a little sermon, and of impressing the Bishop on the\nconvict, so that a mark of the passage might remain behind. This might\nhave appeared to any one else who had this, unfortunate man in his\nhands to afford a chance to nourish his soul as well as his body, and\nto bestow upon him some reproach, seasoned with moralizing and advice,\nor a little commiseration, with an exhortation to conduct himself\nbetter in the future. My brother did not even ask him from what country\nhe came, nor what was his history. For in his history there is a fault,\nand my brother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him of it.\nTo such a point did he carry it, that at one time, when my brother was\nspeaking of the mountaineers of Pontarlier, _who exercise a gentle\nlabor near heaven, and who_, he added, _are happy because they are\ninnocent_, he stopped short, fearing lest in this remark there might\nhave escaped him something which might wound the man. By dint of\nreflection, I think I have comprehended what was passing in my\nbrother’s heart. He was thinking, no doubt, that this man, whose name\nis Jean Valjean, had his misfortune only too vividly present in his\nmind; that the best thing was to divert him from it, and to make him\nbelieve, if only momentarily, that he was a person like any other, by\ntreating him just in his ordinary way. Is not this indeed, to\nunderstand charity well? Is there not, dear Madame, something truly\nevangelical in this delicacy which abstains from sermon, from\nmoralizing, from allusions? and is not the truest pity, when a man has\na sore point, not to touch it at all? It has seemed to me that this\nmight have been my brother’s private thought. In any case, what I can\nsay is that, if he entertained all these ideas, he gave no sign of\nthem; from beginning to end, even to me he was the same as he is every\nevening, and he supped with this Jean Valjean with the same air and in\nthe same manner in which he would have supped with M. Gédéon le\nPrévost, or with the curate of the parish.\n\n“Towards the end, when he had reached the figs, there came a knock at\nthe door. It was Mother Gerbaud, with her little one in her arms. My\nbrother kissed the child on the brow, and borrowed fifteen sous which I\nhad about me to give to Mother Gerbaud. The man was not paying much\nheed to anything then. He was no longer talking, and he seemed very\nmuch fatigued. After poor old Gerbaud had taken her departure, my\nbrother said grace; then he turned to the man and said to him, ‘You\nmust be in great need of your bed.’ Madame Magloire cleared the table\nvery promptly. I understood that we must retire, in order to allow this\ntraveller to go to sleep, and we both went upstairs. Nevertheless, I\nsent Madame Magloire down a moment later, to carry to the man’s bed a\ngoat skin from the Black Forest, which was in my room. The nights are\nfrigid, and that keeps one warm. It is a pity that this skin is old;\nall the hair is falling out. My brother bought it while he was in\nGermany, at Tottlingen, near the sources of the Danube, as well as the\nlittle ivory-handled knife which I use at table.\n\n“Madame Magloire returned immediately. We said our prayers in the\ndrawing-room, where we hang up the linen, and then we each retired to\nour own chambers, without saying a word to each other.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—TRANQUILLITY\n\n\nAfter bidding his sister good night, Monseigneur Bienvenu took one of\nthe two silver candlesticks from the table, handed the other to his\nguest, and said to him,—\n\n“Monsieur, I will conduct you to your room.”\n\n\nThe man followed him.\n\nAs might have been observed from what has been said above, the house\nwas so arranged that in order to pass into the oratory where the alcove\nwas situated, or to get out of it, it was necessary to traverse the\nBishop’s bedroom.\n\nAt the moment when he was crossing this apartment, Madame Magloire was\nputting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed.\nThis was her last care every evening before she went to bed.\n\nThe Bishop installed his guest in the alcove. A fresh white bed had\nbeen prepared there. The man set the candle down on a small table.\n\n“Well,” said the Bishop, “may you pass a good night. To-morrow morning,\nbefore you set out, you shall drink a cup of warm milk from our cows.”\n\n\n“Thanks, Monsieur l’ Abbé,” said the man.\n\nHardly had he pronounced these words full of peace, when all of a\nsudden, and without transition, he made a strange movement, which would\nhave frozen the two sainted women with horror, had they witnessed it.\nEven at this day it is difficult for us to explain what inspired him at\nthat moment. Did he intend to convey a warning or to throw out a\nmenace? Was he simply obeying a sort of instinctive impulse which was\nobscure even to himself? He turned abruptly to the old man, folded his\narms, and bending upon his host a savage gaze, he exclaimed in a hoarse\nvoice:—\n\n“Ah! really! You lodge me in your house, close to yourself like this?”\n\n\nHe broke off, and added with a laugh in which there lurked something\nmonstrous:—\n\n“Have you really reflected well? How do you know that I have not been\nan assassin?”\n\n\nThe Bishop replied:—\n\n“That is the concern of the good God.”\n\n\nThen gravely, and moving his lips like one who is praying or talking to\nhimself, he raised two fingers of his right hand and bestowed his\nbenediction on the man, who did not bow, and without turning his head\nor looking behind him, he returned to his bedroom.\n\nWhen the alcove was in use, a large serge curtain drawn from wall to\nwall concealed the altar. The Bishop knelt before this curtain as he\npassed and said a brief prayer. A moment later he was in his garden,\nwalking, meditating, contemplating, his heart and soul wholly absorbed\nin those grand and mysterious things which God shows at night to the\neyes which remain open.\n\nAs for the man, he was actually so fatigued that he did not even profit\nby the nice white sheets. Snuffing out his candle with his nostrils\nafter the manner of convicts, he dropped, all dressed as he was, upon\nthe bed, where he immediately fell into a profound sleep.\n\nMidnight struck as the Bishop returned from his garden to his\napartment.\n\nA few minutes later all were asleep in the little house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—JEAN VALJEAN\n\n\nTowards the middle of the night Jean Valjean woke.\n\nJean Valjean came from a poor peasant family of Brie. He had not\nlearned to read in his childhood. When he reached man’s estate, he\nbecame a tree-pruner at Faverolles. His mother was named Jeanne\nMathieu; his father was called Jean Valjean or Vlajean, probably a\nsobriquet, and a contraction of _voilà_ Jean, “here’s Jean.”\n\n\nJean Valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition which\nconstitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures. On the whole,\nhowever, there was something decidedly sluggish and insignificant about\nJean Valjean in appearance, at least. He had lost his father and mother\nat a very early age. His mother had died of a milk fever, which had not\nbeen properly attended to. His father, a tree-pruner, like himself, had\nbeen killed by a fall from a tree. All that remained to Jean Valjean\nwas a sister older than himself,—a widow with seven children, boys and\ngirls. This sister had brought up Jean Valjean, and so long as she had\na husband she lodged and fed her young brother.\n\nThe husband died. The eldest of the seven children was eight years old.\nThe youngest, one.\n\nJean Valjean had just attained his twenty-fifth year. He took the\nfather’s place, and, in his turn, supported the sister who had brought\nhim up. This was done simply as a duty and even a little churlishly on\nthe part of Jean Valjean. Thus his youth had been spent in rude and\nill-paid toil. He had never known a “kind woman friend” in his native\nparts. He had not had the time to fall in love.\n\nHe returned at night weary, and ate his broth without uttering a word.\nHis sister, mother Jeanne, often took the best part of his repast from\nhis bowl while he was eating,—a bit of meat, a slice of bacon, the\nheart of the cabbage,—to give to one of her children. As he went on\neating, with his head bent over the table and almost into his soup, his\nlong hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes, he had the\nair of perceiving nothing and allowing it. There was at Faverolles, not\nfar from the Valjean thatched cottage, on the other side of the lane, a\nfarmer’s wife named Marie-Claude; the Valjean children, habitually\nfamished, sometimes went to borrow from Marie-Claude a pint of milk, in\ntheir mother’s name, which they drank behind a hedge or in some alley\ncorner, snatching the jug from each other so hastily that the little\ngirls spilled it on their aprons and down their necks. If their mother\nhad known of this marauding, she would have punished the delinquents\nseverely. Jean Valjean gruffly and grumblingly paid Marie-Claude for\nthe pint of milk behind their mother’s back, and the children were not\npunished.\n\nIn pruning season he earned eighteen sous a day; then he hired out as a\nhay-maker, as laborer, as neat-herd on a farm, as a drudge. He did\nwhatever he could. His sister worked also but what could she do with\nseven little children? It was a sad group enveloped in misery, which\nwas being gradually annihilated. A very hard winter came. Jean had no\nwork. The family had no bread. No bread literally. Seven children!\n\nOne Sunday evening, Maubert Isabeau, the baker on the Church Square at\nFaverolles, was preparing to go to bed, when he heard a violent blow on\nthe grated front of his shop. He arrived in time to see an arm passed\nthrough a hole made by a blow from a fist, through the grating and the\nglass. The arm seized a loaf of bread and carried it off. Isabeau ran\nout in haste; the robber fled at the full speed of his legs. Isabeau\nran after him and stopped him. The thief had flung away the loaf, but\nhis arm was still bleeding. It was Jean Valjean.\n\nThis took place in 1795. Jean Valjean was taken before the tribunals of\nthe time for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at\nnight. He had a gun which he used better than any one else in the\nworld, he was a bit of a poacher, and this injured his case. There\nexists a legitimate prejudice against poachers. The poacher, like the\nsmuggler, smacks too strongly of the brigand. Nevertheless, we will\nremark cursorily, there is still an abyss between these races of men\nand the hideous assassin of the towns. The poacher lives in the forest,\nthe smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea. The cities make\nferocious men because they make corrupt men. The mountain, the sea, the\nforest, make savage men; they develop the fierce side, but often\nwithout destroying the humane side.\n\nJean Valjean was pronounced guilty. The terms of the Code were\nexplicit. There occur formidable hours in our civilization; there are\nmoments when the penal laws decree a shipwreck. What an ominous minute\nis that in which society draws back and consummates the irreparable\nabandonment of a sentient being! Jean Valjean was condemned to five\nyears in the galleys.\n\nOn the 22d of April, 1796, the victory of Montenotte, won by the\ngeneral-in-chief of the army of Italy, whom the message of the\nDirectory to the Five Hundred, of the 2d of Floréal, year IV., calls\nBuona-Parte, was announced in Paris; on that same day a great gang of\ngalley-slaves was put in chains at Bicêtre. Jean Valjean formed a part\nof that gang. An old turnkey of the prison, who is now nearly eighty\nyears old, still recalls perfectly that unfortunate wretch who was\nchained to the end of the fourth line, in the north angle of the\ncourtyard. He was seated on the ground like the others. He did not seem\nto comprehend his position, except that it was horrible. It is probable\nthat he, also, was disentangling from amid the vague ideas of a poor\nman, ignorant of everything, something excessive. While the bolt of his\niron collar was being riveted behind his head with heavy blows from the\nhammer, he wept, his tears stifled him, they impeded his speech; he\nonly managed to say from time to time, “I was a tree-pruner at\nFaverolles.” Then still sobbing, he raised his right hand and lowered\nit gradually seven times, as though he were touching in succession\nseven heads of unequal heights, and from this gesture it was divined\nthat the thing which he had done, whatever it was, he had done for the\nsake of clothing and nourishing seven little children.\n\nHe set out for Toulon. He arrived there, after a journey of\ntwenty-seven days, on a cart, with a chain on his neck. At Toulon he\nwas clothed in the red cassock. All that had constituted his life, even\nto his name, was effaced; he was no longer even Jean Valjean; he was\nnumber 24,601. What became of his sister? What became of the seven\nchildren? Who troubled himself about that? What becomes of the handful\nof leaves from the young tree which is sawed off at the root?\n\nIt is always the same story. These poor living beings, these creatures\nof God, henceforth without support, without guide, without refuge,\nwandered away at random,—who even knows?—each in his own direction\nperhaps, and little by little buried themselves in that cold mist which\nengulfs solitary destinies; gloomy shades, into which disappear in\nsuccession so many unlucky heads, in the sombre march of the human\nrace. They quitted the country. The clock-tower of what had been their\nvillage forgot them; the boundary line of what had been their field\nforgot them; after a few years’ residence in the galleys, Jean Valjean\nhimself forgot them. In that heart, where there had been a wound, there\nwas a scar. That is all. Only once, during all the time which he spent\nat Toulon, did he hear his sister mentioned. This happened, I think,\ntowards the end of the fourth year of his captivity. I know not through\nwhat channels the news reached him. Some one who had known them in\ntheir own country had seen his sister. She was in Paris. She lived in a\npoor street near Saint-Sulpice, in the Rue du Gindre. She had with her\nonly one child, a little boy, the youngest. Where were the other six?\nPerhaps she did not know herself. Every morning she went to a printing\noffice, No. 3 Rue du Sabot, where she was a folder and stitcher. She\nwas obliged to be there at six o’clock in the morning—long before\ndaylight in winter. In the same building with the printing office there\nwas a school, and to this school she took her little boy, who was seven\nyears old. But as she entered the printing office at six, and the\nschool only opened at seven, the child had to wait in the courtyard,\nfor the school to open, for an hour—one hour of a winter night in the\nopen air! They would not allow the child to come into the printing\noffice, because he was in the way, they said. When the workmen passed\nin the morning, they beheld this poor little being seated on the\npavement, overcome with drowsiness, and often fast asleep in the\nshadow, crouched down and doubled up over his basket. When it rained,\nan old woman, the portress, took pity on him; she took him into her\nden, where there was a pallet, a spinning-wheel, and two wooden chairs,\nand the little one slumbered in a corner, pressing himself close to the\ncat that he might suffer less from cold. At seven o’clock the school\nopened, and he entered. That is what was told to Jean Valjean.\n\nThey talked to him about it for one day; it was a moment, a flash, as\nthough a window had suddenly been opened upon the destiny of those\nthings whom he had loved; then all closed again. He heard nothing more\nforever. Nothing from them ever reached him again; he never beheld\nthem; he never met them again; and in the continuation of this mournful\nhistory they will not be met with any more.\n\nTowards the end of this fourth year Jean Valjean’s turn to escape\narrived. His comrades assisted him, as is the custom in that sad place.\nHe escaped. He wandered for two days in the fields at liberty, if being\nat liberty is to be hunted, to turn the head every instant, to quake at\nthe slightest noise, to be afraid of everything,—of a smoking roof, of\na passing man, of a barking dog, of a galloping horse, of a striking\nclock, of the day because one can see, of the night because one cannot\nsee, of the highway, of the path, of a bush, of sleep. On the evening\nof the second day he was captured. He had neither eaten nor slept for\nthirty-six hours. The maritime tribunal condemned him, for this crime,\nto a prolongation of his term for three years, which made eight years.\nIn the sixth year his turn to escape occurred again; he availed himself\nof it, but could not accomplish his flight fully. He was missing at\nroll-call. The cannon were fired, and at night the patrol found him\nhidden under the keel of a vessel in process of construction; he\nresisted the galley guards who seized him. Escape and rebellion. This\ncase, provided for by a special code, was punished by an addition of\nfive years, two of them in the double chain. Thirteen years. In the\ntenth year his turn came round again; he again profited by it; he\nsucceeded no better. Three years for this fresh attempt. Sixteen years.\nFinally, I think it was during his thirteenth year, he made a last\nattempt, and only succeeded in getting retaken at the end of four hours\nof absence. Three years for those four hours. Nineteen years. In\nOctober, 1815, he was released; he had entered there in 1796, for\nhaving broken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread.\n\nRoom for a brief parenthesis. This is the second time, during his\nstudies on the penal question and damnation by law, that the author of\nthis book has come across the theft of a loaf of bread as the point of\ndeparture for the disaster of a destiny. Claude Gaux had stolen a loaf;\nJean Valjean had stolen a loaf. English statistics prove the fact that\nfour thefts out of five in London have hunger for their immediate\ncause.\n\nJean Valjean had entered the galleys sobbing and shuddering; he emerged\nimpassive. He had entered in despair; he emerged gloomy.\n\nWhat had taken place in that soul?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—THE INTERIOR OF DESPAIR\n\n\nLet us try to say it.\n\nIt is necessary that society should look at these things, because it is\nitself which creates them.\n\nHe was, as we have said, an ignorant man, but he was not a fool. The\nlight of nature was ignited in him. Unhappiness, which also possesses a\nclearness of vision of its own, augmented the small amount of daylight\nwhich existed in this mind. Beneath the cudgel, beneath the chain, in\nthe cell, in hardship, beneath the burning sun of the galleys, upon the\nplank bed of the convict, he withdrew into his own consciousness and\nmeditated.\n\nHe constituted himself the tribunal.\n\nHe began by putting himself on trial.\n\nHe recognized the fact that he was not an innocent man unjustly\npunished. He admitted that he had committed an extreme and blameworthy\nact; that that loaf of bread would probably not have been refused to\nhim had he asked for it; that, in any case, it would have been better\nto wait until he could get it through compassion or through work; that\nit is not an unanswerable argument to say, “Can one wait when one is\nhungry?” That, in the first place, it is very rare for any one to die\nof hunger, literally; and next, that, fortunately or unfortunately, man\nis so constituted that he can suffer long and much, both morally and\nphysically, without dying; that it is therefore necessary to have\npatience; that that would even have been better for those poor little\nchildren; that it had been an act of madness for him, a miserable,\nunfortunate wretch, to take society at large violently by the collar,\nand to imagine that one can escape from misery through theft; that that\nis in any case a poor door through which to escape from misery through\nwhich infamy enters; in short, that he was in the wrong.\n\nThen he asked himself:—\n\nWhether he had been the only one in fault in his fatal history. Whether\nit was not a serious thing, that he, a laborer, out of work, that he,\nan industrious man, should have lacked bread. And whether, the fault\nonce committed and confessed, the chastisement had not been ferocious\nand disproportioned. Whether there had not been more abuse on the part\nof the law, in respect to the penalty, than there had been on the part\nof the culprit in respect to his fault. Whether there had not been an\nexcess of weights in one balance of the scale, in the one which\ncontains expiation. Whether the over-weight of the penalty was not\nequivalent to the annihilation of the crime, and did not result in\nreversing the situation, of replacing the fault of the delinquent by\nthe fault of the repression, of converting the guilty man into the\nvictim, and the debtor into the creditor, and of ranging the law\ndefinitely on the side of the man who had violated it.\n\nWhether this penalty, complicated by successive aggravations for\nattempts at escape, had not ended in becoming a sort of outrage\nperpetrated by the stronger upon the feebler, a crime of society\nagainst the individual, a crime which was being committed afresh every\nday, a crime which had lasted nineteen years.\n\nHe asked himself whether human society could have the right to force\nits members to suffer equally in one case for its own unreasonable lack\nof foresight, and in the other case for its pitiless foresight; and to\nseize a poor man forever between a defect and an excess, a default of\nwork and an excess of punishment.\n\nWhether it was not outrageous for society to treat thus precisely those\nof its members who were the least well endowed in the division of goods\nmade by chance, and consequently the most deserving of consideration.\n\nThese questions put and answered, he judged society and condemned it.\n\nHe condemned it to his hatred.\n\nHe made it responsible for the fate which he was suffering, and he said\nto himself that it might be that one day he should not hesitate to call\nit to account. He declared to himself that there was no equilibrium\nbetween the harm which he had caused and the harm which was being done\nto him; he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment was\nnot, in truth, unjust, but that it most assuredly was iniquitous.\n\nAnger may be both foolish and absurd; one can be irritated wrongfully;\none is exasperated only when there is some show of right on one’s side\nat bottom. Jean Valjean felt himself exasperated.\n\nAnd besides, human society had done him nothing but harm; he had never\nseen anything of it save that angry face which it calls Justice, and\nwhich it shows to those whom it strikes. Men had only touched him to\nbruise him. Every contact with them had been a blow. Never, since his\ninfancy, since the days of his mother, of his sister, had he ever\nencountered a friendly word and a kindly glance. From suffering to\nsuffering, he had gradually arrived at the conviction that life is a\nwar; and that in this war he was the conquered. He had no other weapon\nthan his hate. He resolved to whet it in the galleys and to bear it\naway with him when he departed.\n\nThere was at Toulon a school for the convicts, kept by the Ignorantin\nfriars, where the most necessary branches were taught to those of the\nunfortunate men who had a mind for them. He was of the number who had a\nmind. He went to school at the age of forty, and learned to read, to\nwrite, to cipher. He felt that to fortify his intelligence was to\nfortify his hate. In certain cases, education and enlightenment can\nserve to eke out evil.\n\nThis is a sad thing to say; after having judged society, which had\ncaused his unhappiness, he judged Providence, which had made society,\nand he condemned it also.\n\nThus during nineteen years of torture and slavery, this soul mounted\nand at the same time fell. Light entered it on one side, and darkness\non the other.\n\nJean Valjean had not, as we have seen, an evil nature. He was still\ngood when he arrived at the galleys. He there condemned society, and\nfelt that he was becoming wicked; he there condemned Providence, and\nwas conscious that he was becoming impious.\n\nIt is difficult not to indulge in meditation at this point.\n\nDoes human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom? Can the\nman created good by God be rendered wicked by man? Can the soul be\ncompletely made over by fate, and become evil, fate being evil? Can the\nheart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities and\ninfirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness, as\nthe vertebral column beneath too low a vault? Is there not in every\nhuman soul, was there not in the soul of Jean Valjean in particular, a\nfirst spark, a divine element, incorruptible in this world, immortal in\nthe other, which good can develop, fan, ignite, and make to glow with\nsplendor, and which evil can never wholly extinguish?\n\nGrave and obscure questions, to the last of which every physiologist\nwould probably have responded no, and that without hesitation, had he\nbeheld at Toulon, during the hours of repose, which were for Jean\nValjean hours of reverie, this gloomy galley-slave, seated with folded\narms upon the bar of some capstan, with the end of his chain thrust\ninto his pocket to prevent its dragging, serious, silent, and\nthoughtful, a pariah of the laws which regarded the man with wrath,\ncondemned by civilization, and regarding heaven with severity.\n\nCertainly,—and we make no attempt to dissimulate the fact,—the\nobserving physiologist would have beheld an irremediable misery; he\nwould, perchance, have pitied this sick man, of the law’s making; but\nhe would not have even essayed any treatment; he would have turned\naside his gaze from the caverns of which he would have caught a glimpse\nwithin this soul, and, like Dante at the portals of hell, he would have\neffaced from this existence the word which the finger of God has,\nnevertheless, inscribed upon the brow of every man,—hope.\n\nWas this state of his soul, which we have attempted to analyze, as\nperfectly clear to Jean Valjean as we have tried to render it for those\nwho read us? Did Jean Valjean distinctly perceive, after their\nformation, and had he seen distinctly during the process of their\nformation, all the elements of which his moral misery was composed? Had\nthis rough and unlettered man gathered a perfectly clear perception of\nthe succession of ideas through which he had, by degrees, mounted and\ndescended to the lugubrious aspects which had, for so many years,\nformed the inner horizon of his spirit? Was he conscious of all that\npassed within him, and of all that was working there? That is something\nwhich we do not presume to state; it is something which we do not even\nbelieve. There was too much ignorance in Jean Valjean, even after his\nmisfortune, to prevent much vagueness from still lingering there. At\ntimes he did not rightly know himself what he felt. Jean Valjean was in\nthe shadows; he suffered in the shadows; he hated in the shadows; one\nmight have said that he hated in advance of himself. He dwelt\nhabitually in this shadow, feeling his way like a blind man and a\ndreamer. Only, at intervals, there suddenly came to him, from without\nand from within, an access of wrath, a surcharge of suffering, a livid\nand rapid flash which illuminated his whole soul, and caused to appear\nabruptly all around him, in front, behind, amid the gleams of a\nfrightful light, the hideous precipices and the sombre perspective of\nhis destiny.\n\nThe flash passed, the night closed in again; and where was he? He no\nlonger knew. The peculiarity of pains of this nature, in which that\nwhich is pitiless—that is to say, that which is\nbrutalizing—predominates, is to transform a man, little by little, by a\nsort of stupid transfiguration, into a wild beast; sometimes into a\nferocious beast.\n\nJean Valjean’s successive and obstinate attempts at escape would alone\nsuffice to prove this strange working of the law upon the human soul.\nJean Valjean would have renewed these attempts, utterly useless and\nfoolish as they were, as often as the opportunity had presented itself,\nwithout reflecting for an instant on the result, nor on the experiences\nwhich he had already gone through. He escaped impetuously, like the\nwolf who finds his cage open. Instinct said to him, “Flee!” Reason\nwould have said, “Remain!” But in the presence of so violent a\ntemptation, reason vanished; nothing remained but instinct. The beast\nalone acted. When he was recaptured, the fresh severities inflicted on\nhim only served to render him still more wild.\n\nOne detail, which we must not omit, is that he possessed a physical\nstrength which was not approached by a single one of the denizens of\nthe galleys. At work, at paying out a cable or winding up a capstan,\nJean Valjean was worth four men. He sometimes lifted and sustained\nenormous weights on his back; and when the occasion demanded it, he\nreplaced that implement which is called a jack-screw, and was formerly\ncalled _orgueil_ [pride], whence, we may remark in passing, is derived\nthe name of the Rue Montorgueil, near the Halles [Fishmarket] in Paris.\nHis comrades had nicknamed him Jean the Jack-screw. Once, when they\nwere repairing the balcony of the town-hall at Toulon, one of those\nadmirable caryatids of Puget, which support the balcony, became\nloosened, and was on the point of falling. Jean Valjean, who was\npresent, supported the caryatid with his shoulder, and gave the workmen\ntime to arrive.\n\nHis suppleness even exceeded his strength. Certain convicts who were\nforever dreaming of escape, ended by making a veritable science of\nforce and skill combined. It is the science of muscles. An entire\nsystem of mysterious statics is daily practised by prisoners, men who\nare forever envious of the flies and birds. To climb a vertical\nsurface, and to find points of support where hardly a projection was\nvisible, was play to Jean Valjean. An angle of the wall being given,\nwith the tension of his back and legs, with his elbows and his heels\nfitted into the unevenness of the stone, he raised himself as if by\nmagic to the third story. He sometimes mounted thus even to the roof of\nthe galley prison.\n\nHe spoke but little. He laughed not at all. An excessive emotion was\nrequired to wring from him, once or twice a year, that lugubrious laugh\nof the convict, which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon. To all\nappearance, he seemed to be occupied in the constant contemplation of\nsomething terrible.\n\nHe was absorbed, in fact.\n\nAthwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushed\nintelligence, he was confusedly conscious that some monstrous thing was\nresting on him. In that obscure and wan shadow within which he crawled,\neach time that he turned his neck and essayed to raise his glance, he\nperceived with terror, mingled with rage, a sort of frightful\naccumulation of things, collecting and mounting above him, beyond the\nrange of his vision,—laws, prejudices, men, and deeds,—whose outlines\nescaped him, whose mass terrified him, and which was nothing else than\nthat prodigious pyramid which we call civilization. He distinguished,\nhere and there in that swarming and formless mass, now near him, now\nafar off and on inaccessible table-lands, some group, some detail,\nvividly illuminated; here the galley-sergeant and his cudgel; there the\ngendarme and his sword; yonder the mitred archbishop; away at the top,\nlike a sort of sun, the Emperor, crowned and dazzling. It seemed to him\nthat these distant splendors, far from dissipating his night, rendered\nit more funereal and more black. All this—laws, prejudices, deeds, men,\nthings—went and came above him, over his head, in accordance with the\ncomplicated and mysterious movement which God imparts to civilization,\nwalking over him and crushing him with I know not what peacefulness in\nits cruelty and inexorability in its indifference. Souls which have\nfallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune, unhappy men lost in\nthe lowest of those limbos at which no one any longer looks, the\nreproved of the law, feel the whole weight of this human society, so\nformidable for him who is without, so frightful for him who is beneath,\nresting upon their heads.\n\nIn this situation Jean Valjean meditated; and what could be the nature\nof his meditation?\n\nIf the grain of millet beneath the millstone had thoughts, it would,\ndoubtless, think that same thing which Jean Valjean thought.\n\nAll these things, realities full of spectres, phantasmagories full of\nrealities, had eventually created for him a sort of interior state\nwhich is almost indescribable.\n\nAt times, amid his convict toil, he paused. He fell to thinking. His\nreason, at one and the same time riper and more troubled than of yore,\nrose in revolt. Everything which had happened to him seemed to him\nabsurd; everything that surrounded him seemed to him impossible. He\nsaid to himself, “It is a dream.” He gazed at the galley-sergeant\nstanding a few paces from him; the galley-sergeant seemed a phantom to\nhim. All of a sudden the phantom dealt him a blow with his cudgel.\n\nVisible nature hardly existed for him. It would almost be true to say\nthat there existed for Jean Valjean neither sun, nor fine summer days,\nnor radiant sky, nor fresh April dawns. I know not what vent-hole\ndaylight habitually illumined his soul.\n\nTo sum up, in conclusion, that which can be summed up and translated\ninto positive results in all that we have just pointed out, we will\nconfine ourselves to the statement that, in the course of nineteen\nyears, Jean Valjean, the inoffensive tree-pruner of Faverolles, the\nformidable convict of Toulon, had become capable, thanks to the manner\nin which the galleys had moulded him, of two sorts of evil action:\nfirstly, of evil action which was rapid, unpremeditated, dashing,\nentirely instinctive, in the nature of reprisals for the evil which he\nhad undergone; secondly, of evil action which was serious, grave,\nconsciously argued out and premeditated, with the false ideas which\nsuch a misfortune can furnish. His deliberate deeds passed through\nthree successive phases, which natures of a certain stamp can alone\ntraverse,—reasoning, will, perseverance. He had for moving causes his\nhabitual wrath, bitterness of soul, a profound sense of indignities\nsuffered, the reaction even against the good, the innocent, and the\njust, if there are any such. The point of departure, like the point of\narrival, for all his thoughts, was hatred of human law; that hatred\nwhich, if it be not arrested in its development by some providential\nincident, becomes, within a given time, the hatred of society, then the\nhatred of the human race, then the hatred of creation, and which\nmanifests itself by a vague, incessant, and brutal desire to do harm to\nsome living being, no matter whom. It will be perceived that it was not\nwithout reason that Jean Valjean’s passport described him as _a very\ndangerous man_.\n\nFrom year to year this soul had dried away slowly, but with fatal\nsureness. When the heart is dry, the eye is dry. On his departure from\nthe galleys it had been nineteen years since he had shed a tear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—BILLOWS AND SHADOWS\n\n\nA man overboard!\n\nWhat matters it? The vessel does not halt. The wind blows. That sombre\nship has a path which it is forced to pursue. It passes on.\n\nThe man disappears, then reappears; he plunges, he rises again to the\nsurface; he calls, he stretches out his arms; he is not heard. The\nvessel, trembling under the hurricane, is wholly absorbed in its own\nworkings; the passengers and sailors do not even see the drowning man;\nhis miserable head is but a speck amid the immensity of the waves. He\ngives vent to desperate cries from out of the depths. What a spectre is\nthat retreating sail! He gazes and gazes at it frantically. It\nretreats, it grows dim, it diminishes in size. He was there but just\nnow, he was one of the crew, he went and came along the deck with the\nrest, he had his part of breath and of sunlight, he was a living man.\nNow, what has taken place? He has slipped, he has fallen; all is at an\nend.\n\nHe is in the tremendous sea. Under foot he has nothing but what flees\nand crumbles. The billows, torn and lashed by the wind, encompass him\nhideously; the tossings of the abyss bear him away; all the tongues of\nwater dash over his head; a populace of waves spits upon him; confused\nopenings half devour him; every time that he sinks, he catches glimpses\nof precipices filled with night; frightful and unknown vegetations\nseize him, knot about his feet, draw him to them; he is conscious that\nhe is becoming an abyss, that he forms part of the foam; the waves toss\nhim from one to another; he drinks in the bitterness; the cowardly\nocean attacks him furiously, to drown him; the enormity plays with his\nagony. It seems as though all that water were hate.\n\nNevertheless, he struggles.\n\nHe tries to defend himself; he tries to sustain himself; he makes an\neffort; he swims. He, his petty strength all exhausted instantly,\ncombats the inexhaustible.\n\nWhere, then, is the ship? Yonder. Barely visible in the pale shadows of\nthe horizon.\n\nThe wind blows in gusts; all the foam overwhelms him. He raises his\neyes and beholds only the lividness of the clouds. He witnesses, amid\nhis death-pangs, the immense madness of the sea. He is tortured by this\nmadness; he hears noises strange to man, which seem to come from beyond\nthe limits of the earth, and from one knows not what frightful region\nbeyond.\n\nThere are birds in the clouds, just as there are angels above human\ndistresses; but what can they do for him? They sing and fly and float,\nand he, he rattles in the death agony.\n\nHe feels himself buried in those two infinities, the ocean and the sky,\nat one and the same time: the one is a tomb; the other is a shroud.\n\nNight descends; he has been swimming for hours; his strength is\nexhausted; that ship, that distant thing in which there were men, has\nvanished; he is alone in the formidable twilight gulf; he sinks, he\nstiffens himself, he twists himself; he feels under him the monstrous\nbillows of the invisible; he shouts.\n\nThere are no more men. Where is God?\n\nHe shouts. Help! Help! He still shouts on.\n\nNothing on the horizon; nothing in heaven.\n\nHe implores the expanse, the waves, the seaweed, the reef; they are\ndeaf. He beseeches the tempest; the imperturbable tempest obeys only\nthe infinite.\n\nAround him darkness, fog, solitude, the stormy and nonsentient tumult,\nthe undefined curling of those wild waters. In him horror and fatigue.\nBeneath him the depths. Not a point of support. He thinks of the gloomy\nadventures of the corpse in the limitless shadow. The bottomless cold\nparalyzes him. His hands contract convulsively; they close, and grasp\nnothingness. Winds, clouds, whirlwinds, gusts, useless stars! What is\nto be done? The desperate man gives up; he is weary, he chooses the\nalternative of death; he resists not; he lets himself go; he abandons\nhis grip; and then he tosses forevermore in the lugubrious dreary\ndepths of engulfment.\n\nOh, implacable march of human societies! Oh, losses of men and of souls\non the way! Ocean into which falls all that the law lets slip!\nDisastrous absence of help! Oh, moral death!\n\nThe sea is the inexorable social night into which the penal laws fling\ntheir condemned. The sea is the immensity of wretchedness.\n\nThe soul, going downstream in this gulf, may become a corpse. Who shall\nresuscitate it?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—NEW TROUBLES\n\n\nWhen the hour came for him to take his departure from the galleys, when\nJean Valjean heard in his ear the strange words, _Thou art free!_ the\nmoment seemed improbable and unprecedented; a ray of vivid light, a ray\nof the true light of the living, suddenly penetrated within him. But it\nwas not long before this ray paled. Jean Valjean had been dazzled by\nthe idea of liberty. He had believed in a new life. He very speedily\nperceived what sort of liberty it is to which a yellow passport is\nprovided.\n\nAnd this was encompassed with much bitterness. He had calculated that\nhis earnings, during his sojourn in the galleys, ought to amount to a\nhundred and seventy-one francs. It is but just to add that he had\nforgotten to include in his calculations the forced repose of Sundays\nand festival days during nineteen years, which entailed a diminution of\nabout eighty francs. At all events, his hoard had been reduced by\nvarious local levies to the sum of one hundred and nine francs fifteen\nsous, which had been counted out to him on his departure. He had\nunderstood nothing of this, and had thought himself wronged. Let us say\nthe word—robbed.\n\nOn the day following his liberation, he saw, at Grasse, in front of an\norange-flower distillery, some men engaged in unloading bales. He\noffered his services. Business was pressing; they were accepted. He set\nto work. He was intelligent, robust, adroit; he did his best; the\nmaster seemed pleased. While he was at work, a gendarme passed,\nobserved him, and demanded his papers. It was necessary to show him the\nyellow passport. That done, Jean Valjean resumed his labor. A little\nwhile before he had questioned one of the workmen as to the amount\nwhich they earned each day at this occupation; he had been told _thirty\nsous_. When evening arrived, as he was forced to set out again on the\nfollowing day, he presented himself to the owner of the distillery and\nrequested to be paid. The owner did not utter a word, but handed him\nfifteen sous. He objected. He was told, _“That is enough for thee.”_ He\npersisted. The master looked him straight between the eyes, and said to\nhim _“Beware of the prison.”_\n\nThere, again, he considered that he had been robbed.\n\nSociety, the State, by diminishing his hoard, had robbed him wholesale.\nNow it was the individual who was robbing him at retail.\n\nLiberation is not deliverance. One gets free from the galleys, but not\nfrom the sentence.\n\nThat is what happened to him at Grasse. We have seen in what manner he\nwas received at D——\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X—THE MAN AROUSED\n\n\nAs the Cathedral clock struck two in the morning, Jean Valjean awoke.\n\nWhat woke him was that his bed was too good. It was nearly twenty years\nsince he had slept in a bed, and, although he had not undressed, the\nsensation was too novel not to disturb his slumbers.\n\nHe had slept more than four hours. His fatigue had passed away. He was\naccustomed not to devote many hours to repose.\n\nHe opened his eyes and stared into the gloom which surrounded him; then\nhe closed them again, with the intention of going to sleep once more.\n\nWhen many varied sensations have agitated the day, when various matters\npreoccupy the mind, one falls asleep once, but not a second time. Sleep\ncomes more easily than it returns. This is what happened to Jean\nValjean. He could not get to sleep again, and he fell to thinking.\n\nHe was at one of those moments when the thoughts which one has in one’s\nmind are troubled. There was a sort of dark confusion in his brain. His\nmemories of the olden time and of the immediate present floated there\npell-mell and mingled confusedly, losing their proper forms, becoming\ndisproportionately large, then suddenly disappearing, as in a muddy and\nperturbed pool. Many thoughts occurred to him; but there was one which\nkept constantly presenting itself afresh, and which drove away all\nothers. We will mention this thought at once: he had observed the six\nsets of silver forks and spoons and the ladle which Madame Magloire had\nplaced on the table.\n\nThose six sets of silver haunted him.—They were there.—A few paces\ndistant.—Just as he was traversing the adjoining room to reach the one\nin which he then was, the old servant-woman had been in the act of\nplacing them in a little cupboard near the head of the bed.—He had\ntaken careful note of this cupboard.—On the right, as you entered from\nthe dining-room.—They were solid.—And old silver.—From the ladle one\ncould get at least two hundred francs.—Double what he had earned in\nnineteen years.—It is true that he would have earned more if “the\n_administration_ had not _robbed him_.”\n\n\nHis mind wavered for a whole hour in fluctuations with which there was\ncertainly mingled some struggle. Three o’clock struck. He opened his\neyes again, drew himself up abruptly into a sitting posture, stretched\nout his arm and felt of his knapsack, which he had thrown down on a\ncorner of the alcove; then he hung his legs over the edge of the bed,\nand placed his feet on the floor, and thus found himself, almost\nwithout knowing it, seated on his bed.\n\nHe remained for a time thoughtfully in this attitude, which would have\nbeen suggestive of something sinister for any one who had seen him thus\nin the dark, the only person awake in that house where all were\nsleeping. All of a sudden he stooped down, removed his shoes and placed\nthem softly on the mat beside the bed; then he resumed his thoughtful\nattitude, and became motionless once more.\n\nThroughout this hideous meditation, the thoughts which we have above\nindicated moved incessantly through his brain; entered, withdrew,\nre-entered, and in a manner oppressed him; and then he thought, also,\nwithout knowing why, and with the mechanical persistence of reverie, of\na convict named Brevet, whom he had known in the galleys, and whose\ntrousers had been upheld by a single suspender of knitted cotton. The\ncheckered pattern of that suspender recurred incessantly to his mind.\n\nHe remained in this situation, and would have so remained indefinitely,\neven until daybreak, had not the clock struck one—the half or quarter\nhour. It seemed to him that that stroke said to him, “Come on!”\n\n\nHe rose to his feet, hesitated still another moment, and listened; all\nwas quiet in the house; then he walked straight ahead, with short\nsteps, to the window, of which he caught a glimpse. The night was not\nvery dark; there was a full moon, across which coursed large clouds\ndriven by the wind. This created, outdoors, alternate shadow and gleams\nof light, eclipses, then bright openings of the clouds; and indoors a\nsort of twilight. This twilight, sufficient to enable a person to see\nhis way, intermittent on account of the clouds, resembled the sort of\nlivid light which falls through an air-hole in a cellar, before which\nthe passers-by come and go. On arriving at the window, Jean Valjean\nexamined it. It had no grating; it opened in the garden and was\nfastened, according to the fashion of the country, only by a small pin.\nHe opened it; but as a rush of cold and piercing air penetrated the\nroom abruptly, he closed it again immediately. He scrutinized the\ngarden with that attentive gaze which studies rather than looks. The\ngarden was enclosed by a tolerably low white wall, easy to climb. Far\naway, at the extremity, he perceived tops of trees, spaced at regular\nintervals, which indicated that the wall separated the garden from an\navenue or lane planted with trees.\n\nHaving taken this survey, he executed a movement like that of a man who\nhas made up his mind, strode to his alcove, grasped his knapsack,\nopened it, fumbled in it, pulled out of it something which he placed on\nthe bed, put his shoes into one of his pockets, shut the whole thing up\nagain, threw the knapsack on his shoulders, put on his cap, drew the\nvisor down over his eyes, felt for his cudgel, went and placed it in\nthe angle of the window; then returned to the bed, and resolutely\nseized the object which he had deposited there. It resembled a short\nbar of iron, pointed like a pike at one end. It would have been\ndifficult to distinguish in that darkness for what employment that bit\nof iron could have been designed. Perhaps it was a lever; possibly it\nwas a club.\n\nIn the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing\nmore than a miner’s candlestick. Convicts were, at that period,\nsometimes employed in quarrying stone from the lofty hills which\nenviron Toulon, and it was not rare for them to have miners’ tools at\ntheir command. These miners’ candlesticks are of massive iron,\nterminated at the lower extremity by a point, by means of which they\nare stuck into the rock.\n\nHe took the candlestick in his right hand; holding his breath and\ntrying to deaden the sound of his tread, he directed his steps to the\ndoor of the adjoining room, occupied by the Bishop, as we already know.\n\nOn arriving at this door, he found it ajar. The Bishop had not closed\nit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI—WHAT HE DOES\n\n\nJean Valjean listened. Not a sound.\n\nHe gave the door a push.\n\nHe pushed it gently with the tip of his finger, lightly, with the\nfurtive and uneasy gentleness of a cat which is desirous of entering.\n\nThe door yielded to this pressure, and made an imperceptible and silent\nmovement, which enlarged the opening a little.\n\nHe waited a moment; then gave the door a second and a bolder push.\n\nIt continued to yield in silence. The opening was now large enough to\nallow him to pass. But near the door there stood a little table, which\nformed an embarrassing angle with it, and barred the entrance.\n\nJean Valjean recognized the difficulty. It was necessary, at any cost,\nto enlarge the aperture still further.\n\nHe decided on his course of action, and gave the door a third push,\nmore energetic than the two preceding. This time a badly oiled hinge\nsuddenly emitted amid the silence a hoarse and prolonged cry.\n\nJean Valjean shuddered. The noise of the hinge rang in his ears with\nsomething of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the Day\nof Judgment.\n\nIn the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost imagined\nthat that hinge had just become animated, and had suddenly assumed a\nterrible life, and that it was barking like a dog to arouse every one,\nand warn and to wake those who were asleep. He halted, shuddering,\nbewildered, and fell back from the tips of his toes upon his heels. He\nheard the arteries in his temples beating like two forge hammers, and\nit seemed to him that his breath issued from his breast with the roar\nof the wind issuing from a cavern. It seemed impossible to him that the\nhorrible clamor of that irritated hinge should not have disturbed the\nentire household, like the shock of an earthquake; the door, pushed by\nhim, had taken the alarm, and had shouted; the old man would rise at\nonce; the two old women would shriek out; people would come to their\nassistance; in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be in an\nuproar, and the gendarmerie on hand. For a moment he thought himself\nlost.\n\nHe remained where he was, petrified like the statue of salt, not daring\nto make a movement. Several minutes elapsed. The door had fallen wide\nopen. He ventured to peep into the next room. Nothing had stirred\nthere. He lent an ear. Nothing was moving in the house. The noise made\nby the rusty hinge had not awakened any one.\n\nThis first danger was past; but there still reigned a frightful tumult\nwithin him. Nevertheless, he did not retreat. Even when he had thought\nhimself lost, he had not drawn back. His only thought now was to finish\nas soon as possible. He took a step and entered the room.\n\nThis room was in a state of perfect calm. Here and there vague and\nconfused forms were distinguishable, which in the daylight were papers\nscattered on a table, open folios, volumes piled upon a stool, an\narmchair heaped with clothing, a prie-Dieu, and which at that hour were\nonly shadowy corners and whitish spots. Jean Valjean advanced with\nprecaution, taking care not to knock against the furniture. He could\nhear, at the extremity of the room, the even and tranquil breathing of\nthe sleeping Bishop.\n\nHe suddenly came to a halt. He was near the bed. He had arrived there\nsooner than he had thought for.\n\nNature sometimes mingles her effects and her spectacles with our\nactions with sombre and intelligent appropriateness, as though she\ndesired to make us reflect. For the last half-hour a large cloud had\ncovered the heavens. At the moment when Jean Valjean paused in front of\nthe bed, this cloud parted, as though on purpose, and a ray of light,\ntraversing the long window, suddenly illuminated the Bishop’s pale\nface. He was sleeping peacefully. He lay in his bed almost completely\ndressed, on account of the cold of the Basses-Alps, in a garment of\nbrown wool, which covered his arms to the wrists. His head was thrown\nback on the pillow, in the careless attitude of repose; his hand,\nadorned with the pastoral ring, and whence had fallen so many good\ndeeds and so many holy actions, was hanging over the edge of the bed.\nHis whole face was illumined with a vague expression of satisfaction,\nof hope, and of felicity. It was more than a smile, and almost a\nradiance. He bore upon his brow the indescribable reflection of a light\nwhich was invisible. The soul of the just contemplates in sleep a\nmysterious heaven.\n\nA reflection of that heaven rested on the Bishop.\n\nIt was, at the same time, a luminous transparency, for that heaven was\nwithin him. That heaven was his conscience.\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\n1b2-10-the-fallTH (58K)\n\n\nAt the moment when the ray of moonlight superposed itself, so to speak,\nupon that inward radiance, the sleeping Bishop seemed as in a glory. It\nremained, however, gentle and veiled in an ineffable half-light. That\nmoon in the sky, that slumbering nature, that garden without a quiver,\nthat house which was so calm, the hour, the moment, the silence, added\nsome solemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of this\nman, and enveloped in a sort of serene and majestic aureole that white\nhair, those closed eyes, that face in which all was hope and all was\nconfidence, that head of an old man, and that slumber of an infant.\n\nThere was something almost divine in this man, who was thus august,\nwithout being himself aware of it.\n\nJean Valjean was in the shadow, and stood motionless, with his iron\ncandlestick in his hand, frightened by this luminous old man. Never had\nhe beheld anything like this. This confidence terrified him. The moral\nworld has no grander spectacle than this: a troubled and uneasy\nconscience, which has arrived on the brink of an evil action,\ncontemplating the slumber of the just.\n\nThat slumber in that isolation, and with a neighbor like himself, had\nabout it something sublime, of which he was vaguely but imperiously\nconscious.\n\nNo one could have told what was passing within him, not even himself.\nIn order to attempt to form an idea of it, it is necessary to think of\nthe most violent of things in the presence of the most gentle. Even on\nhis visage it would have been impossible to distinguish anything with\ncertainty. It was a sort of haggard astonishment. He gazed at it, and\nthat was all. But what was his thought? It would have been impossible\nto divine it. What was evident was, that he was touched and astounded.\nBut what was the nature of this emotion?\n\nHis eye never quitted the old man. The only thing which was clearly to\nbe inferred from his attitude and his physiognomy was a strange\nindecision. One would have said that he was hesitating between the two\nabysses,—the one in which one loses one’s self and that in which one\nsaves one’s self. He seemed prepared to crush that skull or to kiss\nthat hand.\n\nAt the expiration of a few minutes his left arm rose slowly towards his\nbrow, and he took off his cap; then his arm fell back with the same\ndeliberation, and Jean Valjean fell to meditating once more, his cap in\nhis left hand, his club in his right hand, his hair bristling all over\nhis savage head.\n\nThe Bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that terrifying\ngaze.\n\nThe gleam of the moon rendered confusedly visible the crucifix over the\nchimney-piece, which seemed to be extending its arms to both of them,\nwith a benediction for one and pardon for the other.\n\nSuddenly Jean Valjean replaced his cap on his brow; then stepped\nrapidly past the bed, without glancing at the Bishop, straight to the\ncupboard, which he saw near the head; he raised his iron candlestick as\nthough to force the lock; the key was there; he opened it; the first\nthing which presented itself to him was the basket of silverware; he\nseized it, traversed the chamber with long strides, without taking any\nprecautions and without troubling himself about the noise, gained the\ndoor, re-entered the oratory, opened the window, seized his cudgel,\nbestrode the window-sill of the ground floor, put the silver into his\nknapsack, threw away the basket, crossed the garden, leaped over the\nwall like a tiger, and fled.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII—THE BISHOP WORKS\n\n\nThe next morning at sunrise Monseigneur Bienvenu was strolling in his\ngarden. Madame Magloire ran up to him in utter consternation.\n\n“Monseigneur, Monseigneur!” she exclaimed, “does your Grace know where\nthe basket of silver is?”\n\n\n“Yes,” replied the Bishop.\n\n“Jesus the Lord be blessed!” she resumed; “I did not know what had\nbecome of it.”\n\n\nThe Bishop had just picked up the basket in a flower-bed. He presented\nit to Madame Magloire.\n\n“Here it is.”\n\n\n“Well!” said she. “Nothing in it! And the silver?”\n\n\n“Ah,” returned the Bishop, “so it is the silver which troubles you? I\ndon’t know where it is.”\n\n\n“Great, good God! It is stolen! That man who was here last night has\nstolen it.”\n\n\nIn a twinkling, with all the vivacity of an alert old woman, Madame\nMagloire had rushed to the oratory, entered the alcove, and returned to\nthe Bishop. The Bishop had just bent down, and was sighing as he\nexamined a plant of cochlearia des Guillons, which the basket had\nbroken as it fell across the bed. He rose up at Madame Magloire’s cry.\n\n“Monseigneur, the man is gone! The silver has been stolen!”\n\n\nAs she uttered this exclamation, her eyes fell upon a corner of the\ngarden, where traces of the wall having been scaled were visible. The\ncoping of the wall had been torn away.\n\n“Stay! yonder is the way he went. He jumped over into Cochefilet Lane.\nAh, the abomination! He has stolen our silver!”\n\n\nThe Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he raised his grave eyes,\nand said gently to Madame Magloire:—\n\n“And, in the first place, was that silver ours?”\n\n\nMadame Magloire was speechless. Another silence ensued; then the Bishop\nwent on:—\n\n“Madame Magloire, I have for a long time detained that silver\nwrongfully. It belonged to the poor. Who was that man? A poor man,\nevidently.”\n\n\n“Alas! Jesus!” returned Madame Magloire. “It is not for my sake, nor\nfor Mademoiselle’s. It makes no difference to us. But it is for the\nsake of Monseigneur. What is Monseigneur to eat with now?”\n\n\nThe Bishop gazed at her with an air of amazement.\n\n“Ah, come! Are there no such things as pewter forks and spoons?”\n\n\nMadame Magloire shrugged her shoulders.\n\n“Pewter has an odor.”\n\n\n“Iron forks and spoons, then.”\n\n\nMadame Magloire made an expressive grimace.\n\n“Iron has a taste.”\n\n\n“Very well,” said the Bishop; “wooden ones then.”\n\n\nA few moments later he was breakfasting at the very table at which Jean\nValjean had sat on the previous evening. As he ate his breakfast,\nMonseigneur Welcome remarked gayly to his sister, who said nothing, and\nto Madame Magloire, who was grumbling under her breath, that one really\ndoes not need either fork or spoon, even of wood, in order to dip a bit\nof bread in a cup of milk.\n\n“A pretty idea, truly,” said Madame Magloire to herself, as she went\nand came, “to take in a man like that! and to lodge him close to one’s\nself! And how fortunate that he did nothing but steal! Ah, mon Dieu! it\nmakes one shudder to think of it!”\n\n\nAs the brother and sister were about to rise from the table, there came\na knock at the door.\n\n“Come in,” said the Bishop.\n\nThe door opened. A singular and violent group made its appearance on\nthe threshold. Three men were holding a fourth man by the collar. The\nthree men were gendarmes; the other was Jean Valjean.\n\nA brigadier of gendarmes, who seemed to be in command of the group, was\nstanding near the door. He entered and advanced to the Bishop, making a\nmilitary salute.\n\n“Monseigneur—” said he.\n\nAt this word, Jean Valjean, who was dejected and seemed overwhelmed,\nraised his head with an air of stupefaction.\n\n“Monseigneur!” he murmured. “So he is not the curé?”\n\n\n“Silence!” said the gendarme. “He is Monseigneur the Bishop.”\n\n\nIn the meantime, Monseigneur Bienvenu had advanced as quickly as his\ngreat age permitted.\n\n“Ah! here you are!” he exclaimed, looking at Jean Valjean. “I am glad\nto see you. Well, but how is this? I gave you the candlesticks too,\nwhich are of silver like the rest, and for which you can certainly get\ntwo hundred francs. Why did you not carry them away with your forks and\nspoons?”\n\n\nJean Valjean opened his eyes wide, and stared at the venerable Bishop\nwith an expression which no human tongue can render any account of.\n\n“Monseigneur,” said the brigadier of gendarmes, “so what this man said\nis true, then? We came across him. He was walking like a man who is\nrunning away. We stopped him to look into the matter. He had this\nsilver—”\n\n\n“And he told you,” interposed the Bishop with a smile, “that it had\nbeen given to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he had\npassed the night? I see how the matter stands. And you have brought him\nback here? It is a mistake.”\n\n\n“In that case,” replied the brigadier, “we can let him go?”\n\n\n“Certainly,” replied the Bishop.\n\nThe gendarmes released Jean Valjean, who recoiled.\n\n“Is it true that I am to be released?” he said, in an almost\ninarticulate voice, and as though he were talking in his sleep.\n\n“Yes, thou art released; dost thou not understand?” said one of the\ngendarmes.\n\n“My friend,” resumed the Bishop, “before you go, here are your\ncandlesticks. Take them.”\n\n\nHe stepped to the chimney-piece, took the two silver candlesticks, and\nbrought them to Jean Valjean. The two women looked on without uttering\na word, without a gesture, without a look which could disconcert the\nBishop.\n\nJean Valjean was trembling in every limb. He took the two candlesticks\nmechanically, and with a bewildered air.\n\n“Now,” said the Bishop, “go in peace. By the way, when you return, my\nfriend, it is not necessary to pass through the garden. You can always\nenter and depart through the street door. It is never fastened with\nanything but a latch, either by day or by night.”\n\n\nThen, turning to the gendarmes:—\n\n“You may retire, gentlemen.”\n\n\nThe gendarmes retired.\n\nJean Valjean was like a man on the point of fainting.\n\nThe Bishop drew near to him, and said in a low voice:—\n\n“Do not forget, never forget, that you have promised to use this money\nin becoming an honest man.”\n\n\nJean Valjean, who had no recollection of ever having promised anything,\nremained speechless. The Bishop had emphasized the words when he\nuttered them. He resumed with solemnity:—\n\n“Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good.\nIt is your soul that I buy from you; I withdraw it from black thoughts\nand the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII—LITTLE GERVAIS\n\n\nJean Valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it. He set\nout at a very hasty pace through the fields, taking whatever roads and\npaths presented themselves to him, without perceiving that he was\nincessantly retracing his steps. He wandered thus the whole morning,\nwithout having eaten anything and without feeling hungry. He was the\nprey of a throng of novel sensations. He was conscious of a sort of\nrage; he did not know against whom it was directed. He could not have\ntold whether he was touched or humiliated. There came over him at\nmoments a strange emotion which he resisted and to which he opposed the\nhardness acquired during the last twenty years of his life. This state\nof mind fatigued him. He perceived with dismay that the sort of\nfrightful calm which the injustice of his misfortune had conferred upon\nhim was giving way within him. He asked himself what would replace\nthis. At times he would have actually preferred to be in prison with\nthe gendarmes, and that things should not have happened in this way; it\nwould have agitated him less. Although the season was tolerably far\nadvanced, there were still a few late flowers in the hedge-rows here\nand there, whose odor as he passed through them in his march recalled\nto him memories of his childhood. These memories were almost\nintolerable to him, it was so long since they had recurred to him.\n\nUnutterable thoughts assembled within him in this manner all day long.\n\nAs the sun declined to its setting, casting long shadows athwart the\nsoil from every pebble, Jean Valjean sat down behind a bush upon a\nlarge ruddy plain, which was absolutely deserted. There was nothing on\nthe horizon except the Alps. Not even the spire of a distant village.\nJean Valjean might have been three leagues distant from D—— A path\nwhich intersected the plain passed a few paces from the bush.\n\nIn the middle of this meditation, which would have contributed not a\nlittle to render his rags terrifying to any one who might have\nencountered him, a joyous sound became audible.\n\nHe turned his head and saw a little Savoyard, about ten years of age,\ncoming up the path and singing, his hurdy-gurdy on his hip, and his\nmarmot-box on his back.\n\nOne of those gay and gentle children, who go from land to land\naffording a view of their knees through the holes in their trousers.\n\nWithout stopping his song, the lad halted in his march from time to\ntime, and played at knuckle-bones with some coins which he had in his\nhand—his whole fortune, probably.\n\nAmong this money there was one forty-sou piece.\n\nThe child halted beside the bush, without perceiving Jean Valjean, and\ntossed up his handful of sous, which, up to that time, he had caught\nwith a good deal of adroitness on the back of his hand.\n\nThis time the forty-sou piece escaped him, and went rolling towards the\nbrushwood until it reached Jean Valjean.\n\nJean Valjean set his foot upon it.\n\nIn the meantime, the child had looked after his coin and had caught\nsight of him.\n\nHe showed no astonishment, but walked straight up to the man.\n\nThe spot was absolutely solitary. As far as the eye could see there was\nnot a person on the plain or on the path. The only sound was the tiny,\nfeeble cries of a flock of birds of passage, which was traversing the\nheavens at an immense height. The child was standing with his back to\nthe sun, which cast threads of gold in his hair and empurpled with its\nblood-red gleam the savage face of Jean Valjean.\n\n“Sir,” said the little Savoyard, with that childish confidence which is\ncomposed of ignorance and innocence, “my money.”\n\n\n“What is your name?” said Jean Valjean.\n\n“Little Gervais, sir.”\n\n\n“Go away,” said Jean Valjean.\n\n“Sir,” resumed the child, “give me back my money.”\n\n\nJean Valjean dropped his head, and made no reply.\n\nThe child began again, “My money, sir.”\n\n\nJean Valjean’s eyes remained fixed on the earth.\n\n“My piece of money!” cried the child, “my white piece! my silver!”\n\n\nIt seemed as though Jean Valjean did not hear him. The child grasped\nhim by the collar of his blouse and shook him. At the same time he made\nan effort to displace the big iron-shod shoe which rested on his\ntreasure.\n\n“I want my piece of money! my piece of forty sous!”\n\n\nThe child wept. Jean Valjean raised his head. He still remained seated.\nHis eyes were troubled. He gazed at the child, in a sort of amazement,\nthen he stretched out his hand towards his cudgel and cried in a\nterrible voice, “Who’s there?”\n\n\n“I, sir,” replied the child. “Little Gervais! I! Give me back my forty\nsous, if you please! Take your foot away, sir, if you please!”\n\n\nThen irritated, though he was so small, and becoming almost menacing:—\n\n“Come now, will you take your foot away? Take your foot away, or we’ll\nsee!”\n\n\n“Ah! It’s still you!” said Jean Valjean, and rising abruptly to his\nfeet, his foot still resting on the silver piece, he added:—\n\n“Will you take yourself off!”\n\n\nThe frightened child looked at him, then began to tremble from head to\nfoot, and after a few moments of stupor he set out, running at the top\nof his speed, without daring to turn his neck or to utter a cry.\n\nNevertheless, lack of breath forced him to halt after a certain\ndistance, and Jean Valjean heard him sobbing, in the midst of his own\nreverie.\n\nAt the end of a few moments the child had disappeared.\n\nThe sun had set.\n\nThe shadows were descending around Jean Valjean. He had eaten nothing\nall day; it is probable that he was feverish.\n\nHe had remained standing and had not changed his attitude after the\nchild’s flight. The breath heaved his chest at long and irregular\nintervals. His gaze, fixed ten or twelve paces in front of him, seemed\nto be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancient\nfragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass. All at once\nhe shivered; he had just begun to feel the chill of evening.\n\nHe settled his cap more firmly on his brow, sought mechanically to\ncross and button his blouse, advanced a step and stopped to pick up his\ncudgel.\n\nAt that moment he caught sight of the forty-sou piece, which his foot\nhad half ground into the earth, and which was shining among the\npebbles. It was as though he had received a galvanic shock. “What is\nthis?” he muttered between his teeth. He recoiled three paces, then\nhalted, without being able to detach his gaze from the spot which his\nfoot had trodden but an instant before, as though the thing which lay\nglittering there in the gloom had been an open eye riveted upon him.\n\nAt the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards the\nsilver coin, seized it, and straightened himself up again and began to\ngaze afar off over the plain, at the same time casting his eyes towards\nall points of the horizon, as he stood there erect and shivering, like\na terrified wild animal which is seeking refuge.\n\nHe saw nothing. Night was falling, the plain was cold and vague, great\nbanks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight.\n\nHe said, “Ah!” and set out rapidly in the direction in which the child\nhad disappeared. After about thirty paces he paused, looked about him\nand saw nothing.\n\nThen he shouted with all his might:—\n\n“Little Gervais! Little Gervais!”\n\n\nHe paused and waited.\n\nThere was no reply.\n\nThe landscape was gloomy and deserted. He was encompassed by space.\nThere was nothing around him but an obscurity in which his gaze was\nlost, and a silence which engulfed his voice.\n\nAn icy north wind was blowing, and imparted to things around him a sort\nof lugubrious life. The bushes shook their thin little arms with\nincredible fury. One would have said that they were threatening and\npursuing some one.\n\nHe set out on his march again, then he began to run; and from time to\ntime he halted and shouted into that solitude, with a voice which was\nthe most formidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible to\nhear, “Little Gervais! Little Gervais!”\n\n\nAssuredly, if the child had heard him, he would have been alarmed and\nwould have taken good care not to show himself. But the child was no\ndoubt already far away.\n\nHe encountered a priest on horseback. He stepped up to him and said:—\n\n“Monsieur le Curé, have you seen a child pass?”\n\n\n“No,” said the priest.\n\n“One named Little Gervais?”\n\n\n“I have seen no one.”\n\n\nHe drew two five-franc pieces from his money-bag and handed them to the\npriest.\n\n“Monsieur le Curé, this is for your poor people. Monsieur le Curé, he\nwas a little lad, about ten years old, with a marmot, I think, and a\nhurdy-gurdy. One of those Savoyards, you know?”\n\n\n“I have not seen him.”\n\n\n“Little Gervais? There are no villages here? Can you tell me?”\n\n\n“If he is like what you say, my friend, he is a little stranger. Such\npersons pass through these parts. We know nothing of them.”\n\n\nJean Valjean seized two more coins of five francs each with violence,\nand gave them to the priest.\n\n“For your poor,” he said.\n\nThen he added, wildly:—\n\n“Monsieur l’Abbé, have me arrested. I am a thief.”\n\n\nThe priest put spurs to his horse and fled in haste, much alarmed.\n\nJean Valjean set out on a run, in the direction which he had first\ntaken.\n\nIn this way he traversed a tolerably long distance, gazing, calling,\nshouting, but he met no one. Two or three times he ran across the plain\ntowards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human being\nreclining or crouching down; it turned out to be nothing but brushwood\nor rocks nearly on a level with the earth. At length, at a spot where\nthree paths intersected each other, he stopped. The moon had risen. He\nsent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time, “Little\nGervais! Little Gervais! Little Gervais!” His shout died away in the\nmist, without even awakening an echo. He murmured yet once more,\n“Little Gervais!” but in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice. It was\nhis last effort; his legs gave way abruptly under him, as though an\ninvisible power had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his\nevil conscience; he fell exhausted, on a large stone, his fists\nclenched in his hair and his face on his knees, and he cried, “I am a\nwretch!”\n\n\nThen his heart burst, and he began to cry. It was the first time that\nhe had wept in nineteen years.\n\nWhen Jean Valjean left the Bishop’s house, he was, as we have seen,\nquite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto. He\ncould not yield to the evidence of what was going on within him. He\nhardened himself against the angelic action and the gentle words of the\nold man. “You have promised me to become an honest man. I buy your\nsoul. I take it away from the spirit of perversity; I give it to the\ngood God.”\n\n\nThis recurred to his mind unceasingly. To this celestial kindness he\nopposed pride, which is the fortress of evil within us. He was\nindistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatest\nassault and the most formidable attack which had moved him yet; that\nhis obduracy was finally settled if he resisted this clemency; that if\nhe yielded, he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the\nactions of other men had filled his soul through so many years, and\nwhich pleased him; that this time it was necessary to conquer or to be\nconquered; and that a struggle, a colossal and final struggle, had been\nbegun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man.\n\nIn the presence of these lights, he proceeded like a man who is\nintoxicated. As he walked thus with haggard eyes, did he have a\ndistinct perception of what might result to him from his adventure at\nD——? Did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or\nimportune the spirit at certain moments of life? Did a voice whisper in\nhis ear that he had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny; that\nthere no longer remained a middle course for him; that if he were not\nhenceforth the best of men, he would be the worst; that it behooved him\nnow, so to speak, to mount higher than the Bishop, or fall lower than\nthe convict; that if he wished to become good he must become an angel;\nthat if he wished to remain evil, he must become a monster?\n\nHere, again, some questions must be put, which we have already put to\nourselves elsewhere: did he catch some shadow of all this in his\nthought, in a confused way? Misfortune certainly, as we have said, does\nform the education of the intelligence; nevertheless, it is doubtful\nwhether Jean Valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we have\nhere indicated. If these ideas occurred to him, he but caught glimpses\nof, rather than saw them, and they only succeeded in throwing him into\nan unutterable and almost painful state of emotion. On emerging from\nthat black and deformed thing which is called the galleys, the Bishop\nhad hurt his soul, as too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes on\nemerging from the dark. The future life, the possible life which\noffered itself to him henceforth, all pure and radiant, filled him with\ntremors and anxiety. He no longer knew where he really was. Like an\nowl, who should suddenly see the sun rise, the convict had been dazzled\nand blinded, as it were, by virtue.\n\nThat which was certain, that which he did not doubt, was that he was no\nlonger the same man, that everything about him was changed, that it was\nno longer in his power to make it as though the Bishop had not spoken\nto him and had not touched him.\n\nIn this state of mind he had encountered little Gervais, and had robbed\nhim of his forty sous. Why? He certainly could not have explained it;\nwas this the last effect and the supreme effort, as it were, of the\nevil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys,—a remnant of\nimpulse, a result of what is called in statics, _acquired force?_ It\nwas that, and it was also, perhaps, even less than that. Let us say it\nsimply, it was not he who stole; it was not the man; it was the beast,\nwho, by habit and instinct, had simply placed his foot upon that money,\nwhile the intelligence was struggling amid so many novel and hitherto\nunheard-of thoughts besetting it.\n\nWhen intelligence reawakened and beheld that action of the brute, Jean\nValjean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of terror.\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nAwakened  1b2-11-awakened\n\n\nIt was because,—strange phenomenon, and one which was possible only in\nthe situation in which he found himself,—in stealing the money from\nthat child, he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable.\n\nHowever that may be, this last evil action had a decisive effect on\nhim; it abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore in his mind, and\ndispersed it, placed on one side the thick obscurity, and on the other\nthe light, and acted on his soul, in the state in which it then was, as\ncertain chemical reagents act upon a troubled mixture by precipitating\none element and clarifying the other.\n\nFirst of all, even before examining himself and reflecting, all\nbewildered, like one who seeks to save himself, he tried to find the\nchild in order to return his money to him; then, when he recognized the\nfact that this was impossible, he halted in despair. At the moment when\nhe exclaimed “I am a wretch!” he had just perceived what he was, and he\nwas already separated from himself to such a degree, that he seemed to\nhimself to be no longer anything more than a phantom, and as if he had,\nthere before him, in flesh and blood, the hideous galley-convict, Jean\nValjean, cudgel in hand, his blouse on his hips, his knapsack filled\nwith stolen objects on his back, with his resolute and gloomy visage,\nwith his thoughts filled with abominable projects.\n\nExcess of unhappiness had, as we have remarked, made him in some sort a\nvisionary. This, then, was in the nature of a vision. He actually saw\nthat Jean Valjean, that sinister face, before him. He had almost\nreached the point of asking himself who that man was, and he was\nhorrified by him.\n\nHis brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calm\nmoments in which reverie is so profound that it absorbs reality. One no\nlonger beholds the object which one has before one, and one sees, as\nthough apart from one’s self, the figures which one has in one’s own\nmind.\n\nThus he contemplated himself, so to speak, face to face, and at the\nsame time, athwart this hallucination, he perceived in a mysterious\ndepth a sort of light which he at first took for a torch. On\nscrutinizing this light which appeared to his conscience with more\nattention, he recognized the fact that it possessed a human form and\nthat this torch was the Bishop.\n\nHis conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it,—the\nBishop and Jean Valjean. Nothing less than the first was required to\nsoften the second. By one of those singular effects, which are peculiar\nto this sort of ecstasies, in proportion as his reverie continued, as\nthe Bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes, so did Jean Valjean\ngrow less and vanish. After a certain time he was no longer anything\nmore than a shade. All at once he disappeared. The Bishop alone\nremained; he filled the whole soul of this wretched man with a\nmagnificent radiance.\n\nJean Valjean wept for a long time. He wept burning tears, he sobbed\nwith more weakness than a woman, with more fright than a child.\n\nAs he wept, daylight penetrated more and more clearly into his soul; an\nextraordinary light; a light at once ravishing and terrible. His past\nlife, his first fault, his long expiation, his external brutishness,\nhis internal hardness, his dismissal to liberty, rejoicing in manifold\nplans of vengeance, what had happened to him at the Bishop’s, the last\nthing that he had done, that theft of forty sous from a child, a crime\nall the more cowardly, and all the more monstrous since it had come\nafter the Bishop’s pardon,—all this recurred to his mind and appeared\nclearly to him, but with a clearness which he had never hitherto\nwitnessed. He examined his life, and it seemed horrible to him; his\nsoul, and it seemed frightful to him. In the meantime a gentle light\nrested over this life and this soul. It seemed to him that he beheld\nSatan by the light of Paradise.\n\nHow many hours did he weep thus? What did he do after he had wept?\nWhither did he go! No one ever knew. The only thing which seems to be\nauthenticated is that that same night the carrier who served Grenoble\nat that epoch, and who arrived at D—— about three o’clock in the\nmorning, saw, as he traversed the street in which the Bishop’s\nresidence was situated, a man in the attitude of prayer, kneeling on\nthe pavement in the shadow, in front of the door of Monseigneur\nWelcome.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THIRD—IN THE YEAR 1817\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE YEAR 1817\n\n\n1817 is the year which Louis XVIII., with a certain royal assurance\nwhich was not wanting in pride, entitled the twenty-second of his\nreign. It is the year in which M. Bruguière de Sorsum was celebrated.\nAll the hairdressers’ shops, hoping for powder and the return of the\nroyal bird, were besmeared with azure and decked with fleurs-de-lys. It\nwas the candid time at which Count Lynch sat every Sunday as\nchurch-warden in the church-warden’s pew of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, in\nhis costume of a peer of France, with his red ribbon and his long nose\nand the majesty of profile peculiar to a man who has performed a\nbrilliant action. The brilliant action performed by M. Lynch was this:\nbeing mayor of Bordeaux, on the 12th of March, 1814, he had surrendered\nthe city a little too promptly to M. the Duke d’Angoulême. Hence his\npeerage. In 1817 fashion swallowed up little boys of from four to six\nyears of age in vast caps of morocco leather with ear-tabs resembling\nEsquimaux mitres. The French army was dressed in white, after the mode\nof the Austrian; the regiments were called legions; instead of numbers\nthey bore the names of departments; Napoleon was at St. Helena; and\nsince England refused him green cloth, he was having his old coats\nturned. In 1817 Pelligrini sang; Mademoiselle Bigottini danced; Potier\nreigned; Odry did not yet exist. Madame Saqui had succeeded to Forioso.\nThere were still Prussians in France. M. Delalot was a personage.\nLegitimacy had just asserted itself by cutting off the hand, then the\nhead, of Pleignier, of Carbonneau, and of Tolleron. The Prince de\nTalleyrand, grand chamberlain, and the Abbé Louis, appointed minister\nof finance, laughed as they looked at each other, with the laugh of the\ntwo augurs; both of them had celebrated, on the 14th of July, 1790, the\nmass of federation in the Champ de Mars; Talleyrand had said it as\nbishop, Louis had served it in the capacity of deacon. In 1817, in the\nside-alleys of this same Champ de Mars, two great cylinders of wood\nmight have been seen lying in the rain, rotting amid the grass, painted\nblue, with traces of eagles and bees, from which the gilding was\nfalling. These were the columns which two years before had upheld the\nEmperor’s platform in the Champ de Mai. They were blackened here and\nthere with the scorches of the bivouac of Austrians encamped near\nGros-Caillou. Two or three of these columns had disappeared in these\nbivouac fires, and had warmed the large hands of the Imperial troops.\nThe Field of May had this remarkable point: that it had been held in\nthe month of June and in the Field of March (Mars). In this year, 1817,\ntwo things were popular: the Voltaire-Touquet and the snuff-box _à la\nCharter_. The most recent Parisian sensation was the crime of Dautun,\nwho had thrown his brother’s head into the fountain of the\nFlower-Market.\n\nThey had begun to feel anxious at the Naval Department, on account of\nthe lack of news from that fatal frigate, _The Medusa_, which was\ndestined to cover Chaumareix with infamy and Géricault with glory.\nColonel Selves was going to Egypt to become Soliman-Pasha. The palace\nof Thermes, in the Rue de La Harpe, served as a shop for a cooper. On\nthe platform of the octagonal tower of the Hotel de Cluny, the little\nshed of boards, which had served as an observatory to Messier, the\nnaval astronomer under Louis XVI., was still to be seen. The Duchesse\nde Duras read to three or four friends her unpublished _Ourika_, in her\nboudoir furnished by X. in sky-blue satin. The N’s were scratched off\nthe Louvre. The bridge of Austerlitz had abdicated, and was entitled\nthe bridge of the King’s Garden [du Jardin du Roi], a double enigma,\nwhich disguised the bridge of Austerlitz and the Jardin des Plantes at\none stroke. Louis XVIII., much preoccupied while annotating Horace with\nthe corner of his finger-nail, heroes who have become emperors, and\nmakers of wooden shoes who have become dauphins, had two\nanxieties,—Napoleon and Mathurin Bruneau. The French Academy had given\nfor its prize subject, _The Happiness procured through Study_. M.\nBellart was officially eloquent. In his shadow could be seen\ngerminating that future advocate-general of Broë, dedicated to the\nsarcasms of Paul-Louis Courier. There was a false Chateaubriand, named\nMarchangy, in the interim, until there should be a false Marchangy,\nnamed d’Arlincourt. _Claire d’Albe_ and _Malek-Adel_ were masterpieces;\nMadame Cottin was proclaimed the chief writer of the epoch. The\nInstitute had the academician, Napoleon Bonaparte, stricken from its\nlist of members. A royal ordinance erected Angoulême into a naval\nschool; for the Duc d’Angoulême, being lord high admiral, it was\nevident that the city of Angoulême had all the qualities of a seaport;\notherwise the monarchical principle would have received a wound. In the\nCouncil of Ministers the question was agitated whether vignettes\nrepresenting slack-rope performances, which adorned Franconi’s\nadvertising posters, and which attracted throngs of street urchins,\nshould be tolerated. M. Paër, the author of _Agnese_, a good sort of\nfellow, with a square face and a wart on his cheek, directed the little\nprivate concerts of the Marquise de Sasenaye in the Rue Ville l‘Évêque.\nAll the young girls were singing the _Hermit of Saint-Avelle_, with\nwords by Edmond Géraud. _The Yellow Dwarf_ was transferred into\n_Mirror_. The Café Lemblin stood up for the Emperor, against the Café\nValois, which upheld the Bourbons. The Duc de Berri, already surveyed\nfrom the shadow by Louvel, had just been married to a princess of\nSicily. Madame de Staël had died a year previously. The body-guard\nhissed Mademoiselle Mars. The grand newspapers were all very small.\nTheir form was restricted, but their liberty was great. The\n_Constitutionnel_ was constitutional. _La Minerve_ called Chateaubriand\n_Chateaubriant_. That _t_ made the good middle-class people laugh\nheartily at the expense of the great writer. In journals which sold\nthemselves, prostituted journalists, insulted the exiles of 1815. David\nhad no longer any talent, Arnault had no longer any wit, Carnot was no\nlonger honest, Soult had won no battles; it is true that Napoleon had\nno longer any genius. No one is ignorant of the fact that letters sent\nto an exile by post very rarely reached him, as the police made it\ntheir religious duty to intercept them. This is no new fact; Descartes\ncomplained of it in his exile. Now David, having, in a Belgian\npublication, shown some displeasure at not receiving letters which had\nbeen written to him, it struck the royalist journals as amusing; and\nthey derided the prescribed man well on this occasion. What separated\ntwo men more than an abyss was to say, the _regicides_, or to say the\n_voters_; to say the _enemies_, or to say the _allies_; to say\n_Napoleon_, or to say _Buonaparte_. All sensible people were agreed\nthat the era of revolution had been closed forever by King Louis\nXVIII., surnamed “The Immortal Author of the Charter.” On the platform\nof the Pont-Neuf, the word _Redivivus_ was carved on the pedestal that\nawaited the statue of Henry IV. M. Piet, in the Rue Thérèse, No. 4, was\nmaking the rough draft of his privy assembly to consolidate the\nmonarchy. The leaders of the Right said at grave conjunctures, “We must\nwrite to Bacot.” MM. Canuel, O’Mahoney, and De Chappedelaine were\npreparing the sketch, to some extent with Monsieur’s approval, of what\nwas to become later on “The Conspiracy of the Bord de l‘Eau”—of the\nwaterside. L‘Épingle Noire was already plotting in his own quarter.\nDelaverderie was conferring with Trogoff. M. Decazes, who was liberal\nto a degree, reigned. Chateaubriand stood every morning at his window\nat No. 27 Rue Saint-Dominique, clad in footed trousers, and slippers,\nwith a madras kerchief knotted over his gray hair, with his eyes fixed\non a mirror, a complete set of dentist’s instruments spread out before\nhim, cleaning his teeth, which were charming, while he dictated _The\nMonarchy according to the Charter_ to M. Pilorge, his secretary.\nCriticism, assuming an authoritative tone, preferred Lafon to Talma. M.\nde Féletez signed himself A.; M. Hoffmann signed himself Z. Charles\nNodier wrote _Thérèse Aubert_. Divorce was abolished. Lyceums called\nthemselves colleges. The collegians, decorated on the collar with a\ngolden fleur-de-lys, fought each other _apropos_ of the King of Rome.\nThe counter-police of the château had denounced to her Royal Highness\nMadame, the portrait, everywhere exhibited, of M. the Duc d’Orléans,\nwho made a better appearance in his uniform of a colonel-general of\nhussars than M. the Duc de Berri, in his uniform of colonel-general of\ndragoons—a serious inconvenience. The city of Paris was having the dome\nof the Invalides regilded at its own expense. Serious men asked\nthemselves what M. de Trinquelague would do on such or such an\noccasion; M. Clausel de Montals differed on divers points from M.\nClausel de Coussergues; M. de Salaberry was not satisfied. The comedian\nPicard, who belonged to the Academy, which the comedian Molière had not\nbeen able to do, had _The Two Philiberts_ played at the Odéon, upon\nwhose pediment the removal of the letters still allowed THEATRE OF THE\nEMPRESS to be plainly read. People took part for or against Cugnet de\nMontarlot. Fabvier was factious; Bavoux was revolutionary. The Liberal,\nPélicier, published an edition of Voltaire, with the following title:\n_Works of Voltaire_, of the French Academy. “That will attract\npurchasers,” said the ingenious editor. The general opinion was that M.\nCharles Loyson would be the genius of the century; envy was beginning\nto gnaw at him—a sign of glory; and this verse was composed on him:—\n\n“Even when Loyson steals, one feels that he has paws.”\n\n\nAs Cardinal Fesch refused to resign, M. de Pins, Archbishop of Amasie,\nadministered the diocese of Lyons. The quarrel over the valley of\nDappes was begun between Switzerland and France by a memoir from\nCaptain, afterwards General Dufour. Saint-Simon, ignored, was erecting\nhis sublime dream. There was a celebrated Fourier at the Academy of\nScience, whom posterity has forgotten; and in some garret an obscure\nFourier, whom the future will recall. Lord Byron was beginning to make\nhis mark; a note to a poem by Millevoye introduced him to France in\nthese terms: _a certain Lord Baron_. David d’Angers was trying to work\nin marble. The Abbé Caron was speaking, in terms of praise, to a\nprivate gathering of seminarists in the blind alley of Feuillantines,\nof an unknown priest, named Félicité-Robert, who, at a latter date,\nbecame Lamennais. A thing which smoked and clattered on the Seine with\nthe noise of a swimming dog went and came beneath the windows of the\nTuileries, from the Pont Royal to the Pont Louis XV.; it was a piece of\nmechanism which was not good for much; a sort of plaything, the idle\ndream of a dream-ridden inventor; an utopia—a steamboat. The Parisians\nstared indifferently at this useless thing. M. de Vaublanc, the\nreformer of the Institute by a coup d‘état, the distinguished author of\nnumerous academicians, ordinances, and batches of members, after having\ncreated them, could not succeed in becoming one himself. The Faubourg\nSaint-Germain and the pavilion de Marsan wished to have M. Delaveau for\nprefect of police, on account of his piety. Dupuytren and Récamier\nentered into a quarrel in the amphitheatre of the School of Medicine,\nand threatened each other with their fists on the subject of the\ndivinity of Jesus Christ. Cuvier, with one eye on Genesis and the other\non nature, tried to please bigoted reaction by reconciling fossils with\ntexts and by making mastodons flatter Moses.\n\nM. François de Neufchâteau, the praiseworthy cultivator of the memory\nof Parmentier, made a thousand efforts to have _pomme de terre_\n[potato] pronounced _parmentière_, and succeeded therein not at all.\nThe Abbé Grégoire, ex-bishop, ex-conventionary, ex-senator, had passed,\nin the royalist polemics, to the state of “Infamous Grégoire.” The\nlocution of which we have made use—_passed to the state of_—has been\ncondemned as a neologism by M. Royer Collard. Under the third arch of\nthe Pont de Jéna, the new stone with which, the two years previously,\nthe mining aperture made by Blücher to blow up the bridge had been\nstopped up, was still recognizable on account of its whiteness. Justice\nsummoned to its bar a man who, on seeing the Comte d’Artois enter Notre\nDame, had said aloud: _“Sapristi! I regret the time when I saw\nBonaparte and Talma enter the Bel Sauvage, arm in arm.”_ A seditious\nutterance. Six months in prison. Traitors showed themselves unbuttoned;\nmen who had gone over to the enemy on the eve of battle made no secret\nof their recompense, and strutted immodestly in the light of day, in\nthe cynicism of riches and dignities; deserters from Ligny and\nQuatre-Bras, in the brazenness of their well-paid turpitude, exhibited\ntheir devotion to the monarchy in the most barefaced manner.\n\nThis is what floats up confusedly, pell-mell, for the year 1817, and is\nnow forgotten. History neglects nearly all these particulars, and\ncannot do otherwise; the infinity would overwhelm it. Nevertheless,\nthese details, which are wrongly called trivial,—there are no trivial\nfacts in humanity, nor little leaves in vegetation,—are useful. It is\nof the physiognomy of the years that the physiognomy of the centuries\nis composed. In this year of 1817 four young Parisians arranged “a fine\nfarce.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—A DOUBLE QUARTETTE\n\n\nThese Parisians came, one from Toulouse, another from Limoges, the\nthird from Cahors, and the fourth from Montauban; but they were\nstudents; and when one says student, one says Parisian: to study in\nParis is to be born in Paris.\n\nThese young men were insignificant; every one has seen such faces; four\nspecimens of humanity taken at random; neither good nor bad, neither\nwise nor ignorant, neither geniuses nor fools; handsome, with that\ncharming April which is called twenty years. They were four Oscars;\nfor, at that epoch, Arthurs did not yet exist. _Burn for him the\nperfumes of Araby!_ exclaimed romance. _Oscar advances. Oscar, I shall\nbehold him!_ People had just emerged from Ossian; elegance was\nScandinavian and Caledonian; the pure English style was only to prevail\nlater, and the first of the Arthurs, Wellington, had but just won the\nbattle of Waterloo.\n\nThese Oscars bore the names, one of Félix Tholomyès, of Toulouse; the\nsecond, Listolier, of Cahors; the next, Fameuil, of Limoges; the last,\nBlachevelle, of Montauban. Naturally, each of them had his mistress.\nBlachevelle loved Favourite, so named because she had been in England;\nListolier adored Dahlia, who had taken for her nickname the name of a\nflower; Fameuil idolized Zéphine, an abridgment of Joséphine; Tholomyès\nhad Fantine, called the Blonde, because of her beautiful, sunny hair.\n\nFavourite, Dahlia, Zéphine, and Fantine were four ravishing young\nwomen, perfumed and radiant, still a little like working-women, and not\nyet entirely divorced from their needles; somewhat disturbed by\nintrigues, but still retaining on their faces something of the serenity\nof toil, and in their souls that flower of honesty which survives the\nfirst fall in woman. One of the four was called the young, because she\nwas the youngest of them, and one was called the old; the old one was\ntwenty-three. Not to conceal anything, the three first were more\nexperienced, more heedless, and more emancipated into the tumult of\nlife than Fantine the Blonde, who was still in her first illusions.\n\nDahlia, Zéphine, and especially Favourite, could not have said as much.\nThere had already been more than one episode in their romance, though\nhardly begun; and the lover who had borne the name of Adolph in the\nfirst chapter had turned out to be Alphonse in the second, and Gustave\nin the third. Poverty and coquetry are two fatal counsellors; one\nscolds and the other flatters, and the beautiful daughters of the\npeople have both of them whispering in their ear, each on its own side.\nThese badly guarded souls listen. Hence the falls which they\naccomplish, and the stones which are thrown at them. They are\noverwhelmed with splendor of all that is immaculate and inaccessible.\nAlas! what if the Jungfrau were hungry?\n\nFavourite having been in England, was admired by Dahlia and Zéphine.\nShe had had an establishment of her own very early in life. Her father\nwas an old unmarried professor of mathematics, a brutal man and a\nbraggart, who went out to give lessons in spite of his age. This\nprofessor, when he was a young man, had one day seen a chambermaid’s\ngown catch on a fender; he had fallen in love in consequence of this\naccident. The result had been Favourite. She met her father from time\nto time, and he bowed to her. One morning an old woman with the air of\na devotee, had entered her apartments, and had said to her, “You do not\nknow me, Mamemoiselle?” “No.” “I am your mother.” Then the old woman\nopened the sideboard, and ate and drank, had a mattress which she owned\nbrought in, and installed herself. This cross and pious old mother\nnever spoke to Favourite, remained hours without uttering a word,\nbreakfasted, dined, and supped for four, and went down to the porter’s\nquarters for company, where she spoke ill of her daughter.\n\nIt was having rosy nails that were too pretty which had drawn Dahlia to\nListolier, to others perhaps, to idleness. How could she make such\nnails work? She who wishes to remain virtuous must not have pity on her\nhands. As for Zéphine, she had conquered Fameuil by her roguish and\ncaressing little way of saying “Yes, sir.”\n\n\nThe young men were comrades; the young girls were friends. Such loves\nare always accompanied by such friendships.\n\nGoodness and philosophy are two distinct things; the proof of this is\nthat, after making all due allowances for these little irregular\nhouseholds, Favourite, Zéphine, and Dahlia were philosophical young\nwomen, while Fantine was a good girl.\n\nGood! some one will exclaim; and Tholomyès? Solomon would reply that\nlove forms a part of wisdom. We will confine ourselves to saying that\nthe love of Fantine was a first love, a sole love, a faithful love.\n\nShe alone, of all the four, was not called “thou” by a single one of\nthem.\n\nFantine was one of those beings who blossom, so to speak, from the\ndregs of the people. Though she had emerged from the most unfathomable\ndepths of social shadow, she bore on her brow the sign of the anonymous\nand the unknown. She was born at M. sur M. Of what parents? Who can\nsay? She had never known father or mother. She was called Fantine. Why\nFantine? She had never borne any other name. At the epoch of her birth\nthe Directory still existed. She had no family name; she had no family;\nno baptismal name; the Church no longer existed. She bore the name\nwhich pleased the first random passer-by, who had encountered her, when\na very small child, running bare-legged in the street. She received the\nname as she received the water from the clouds upon her brow when it\nrained. She was called little Fantine. No one knew more than that. This\nhuman creature had entered life in just this way. At the age of ten,\nFantine quitted the town and went to service with some farmers in the\nneighborhood. At fifteen she came to Paris “to seek her fortune.”\nFantine was beautiful, and remained pure as long as she could. She was\na lovely blonde, with fine teeth. She had gold and pearls for her\ndowry; but her gold was on her head, and her pearls were in her mouth.\n\nShe worked for her living; then, still for the sake of her living,—for\nthe heart, also, has its hunger,—she loved.\n\nShe loved Tholomyès.\n\nAn amour for him; passion for her. The streets of the Latin quarter,\nfilled with throngs of students and grisettes, saw the beginning of\ntheir dream. Fantine had long evaded Tholomyès in the mazes of the hill\nof the Pantheon, where so many adventurers twine and untwine, but in\nsuch a way as constantly to encounter him again. There is a way of\navoiding which resembles seeking. In short, the eclogue took place.\n\nBlachevelle, Listolier, and Fameuil formed a sort of group of which\nTholomyès was the head. It was he who possessed the wit.\n\nTholomyès was the antique old student; he was rich; he had an income of\nfour thousand francs; four thousand francs! a splendid scandal on Mount\nSainte-Geneviève. Tholomyès was a fast man of thirty, and badly\npreserved. He was wrinkled and toothless, and he had the beginning of a\nbald spot, of which he himself said with sadness, _the skull at thirty,\nthe knee at forty_. His digestion was mediocre, and he had been\nattacked by a watering in one eye. But in proportion as his youth\ndisappeared, gayety was kindled; he replaced his teeth with\nbuffooneries, his hair with mirth, his health with irony, his weeping\neye laughed incessantly. He was dilapidated but still in flower. His\nyouth, which was packing up for departure long before its time, beat a\nretreat in good order, bursting with laughter, and no one saw anything\nbut fire. He had had a piece rejected at the Vaudeville. He made a few\nverses now and then. In addition to this he doubted everything to the\nlast degree, which is a vast force in the eyes of the weak. Being thus\nironical and bald, he was the leader. _Iron_ is an English word. Is it\npossible that irony is derived from it?\n\nOne day Tholomyès took the three others aside, with the gesture of an\noracle, and said to them:—\n\n“Fantine, Dahlia, Zéphine, and Favourite have been teasing us for\nnearly a year to give them a surprise. We have promised them solemnly\nthat we would. They are forever talking about it to us, to me in\nparticular, just as the old women in Naples cry to Saint Januarius,\n‘_Faccia gialluta, fa o miracolo_, Yellow face, perform thy miracle,’\nso our beauties say to me incessantly, ‘Tholomyès, when will you bring\nforth your surprise?’ At the same time our parents keep writing to us.\nPressure on both sides. The moment has arrived, it seems to me; let us\ndiscuss the question.”\n\n\nThereupon, Tholomyès lowered his voice and articulated something so\nmirthful, that a vast and enthusiastic grin broke out upon the four\nmouths simultaneously, and Blachevelle exclaimed, “That is an idea.”\n\n\nA smoky tap-room presented itself; they entered, and the remainder of\ntheir confidential colloquy was lost in shadow.\n\nThe result of these shades was a dazzling pleasure party which took\nplace on the following Sunday, the four young men inviting the four\nyoung girls.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—FOUR AND FOUR\n\n\nIt is hard nowadays to picture to one’s self what a pleasure-trip of\nstudents and grisettes to the country was like, forty-five years ago.\nThe suburbs of Paris are no longer the same; the physiognomy of what\nmay be called circumparisian life has changed completely in the last\nhalf-century; where there was the cuckoo, there is the railway car;\nwhere there was a tender-boat, there is now the steamboat; people speak\nof Fécamp nowadays as they spoke of Saint-Cloud in those days. The\nParis of 1862 is a city which has France for its outskirts.\n\nThe four couples conscientiously went through with all the country\nfollies possible at that time. The vacation was beginning, and it was a\nwarm, bright, summer day. On the preceding day, Favourite, the only one\nwho knew how to write, had written the following to Tholomyès in the\nname of the four: “It is a good hour to emerge from happiness.” That is\nwhy they rose at five o’clock in the morning. Then they went to\nSaint-Cloud by the coach, looked at the dry cascade and exclaimed,\n“This must be very beautiful when there is water!” They breakfasted at\nthe _Tête-Noir_, where Castaing had not yet been; they treated\nthemselves to a game of ring-throwing under the quincunx of trees of\nthe grand fountain; they ascended Diogenes’ lantern, they gambled for\nmacaroons at the roulette establishment of the Pont de Sèvres, picked\nbouquets at Pateaux, bought reed-pipes at Neuilly, ate apple tarts\neverywhere, and were perfectly happy.\n\nThe young girls rustled and chatted like warblers escaped from their\ncage. It was a perfect delirium. From time to time they bestowed little\ntaps on the young men. Matutinal intoxication of life! adorable years!\nthe wings of the dragonfly quiver. Oh, whoever you may be, do you not\nremember? Have you rambled through the brushwood, holding aside the\nbranches, on account of the charming head which is coming on behind\nyou? Have you slid, laughing, down a slope all wet with rain, with a\nbeloved woman holding your hand, and crying, “Ah, my new boots! what a\nstate they are in!”\n\n\nLet us say at once that that merry obstacle, a shower, was lacking in\nthe case of this good-humored party, although Favourite had said as\nthey set out, with a magisterial and maternal tone, _“The slugs are\ncrawling in the paths,—a sign of rain, children.”_\n\nAll four were madly pretty. A good old classic poet, then famous, a\ngood fellow who had an Éléonore, M. le Chevalier de Labouisse, as he\nstrolled that day beneath the chestnut-trees of Saint-Cloud, saw them\npass about ten o’clock in the morning, and exclaimed, “There is one too\nmany of them,” as he thought of the Graces. Favourite, Blachevelle’s\nfriend, the one aged three and twenty, the old one, ran on in front\nunder the great green boughs, jumped the ditches, stalked distractedly\nover bushes, and presided over this merry-making with the spirit of a\nyoung female faun. Zéphine and Dahlia, whom chance had made beautiful\nin such a way that they set each off when they were together, and\ncompleted each other, never left each other, more from an instinct of\ncoquetry than from friendship, and clinging to each other, they assumed\nEnglish poses; the first _keepsakes_ had just made their appearance,\nmelancholy was dawning for women, as later on, Byronism dawned for men;\nand the hair of the tender sex began to droop dolefully. Zéphine and\nDahlia had their hair dressed in rolls. Listolier and Fameuil, who were\nengaged in discussing their professors, explained to Fantine the\ndifference that existed between M. Delvincourt and M. Blondeau.\n\nBlachevelle seemed to have been created expressly to carry Favourite’s\nsingle-bordered, imitation India shawl of Ternaux’s manufacture, on his\narm on Sundays.\n\nTholomyès followed, dominating the group. He was very gay, but one felt\nthe force of government in him; there was dictation in his joviality;\nhis principal ornament was a pair of trousers of elephant-leg pattern\nof nankeen, with straps of braided copper wire; he carried a stout\nrattan worth two hundred francs in his hand, and, as he treated himself\nto everything, a strange thing called a cigar in his mouth. Nothing was\nsacred to him; he smoked.\n\n“That Tholomyès is astounding!” said the others, with veneration. “What\ntrousers! What energy!”\n\n\nAs for Fantine, she was a joy to behold. Her splendid teeth had\nevidently received an office from God,—laughter. She preferred to carry\nher little hat of sewed straw, with its long white strings, in her hand\nrather than on her head. Her thick blond hair, which was inclined to\nwave, and which easily uncoiled, and which it was necessary to fasten\nup incessantly, seemed made for the flight of Galatea under the\nwillows. Her rosy lips babbled enchantingly. The corners of her mouth\nvoluptuously turned up, as in the antique masks of Erigone, had an air\nof encouraging the audacious; but her long, shadowy lashes drooped\ndiscreetly over the jollity of the lower part of the face as though to\ncall a halt. There was something indescribably harmonious and striking\nabout her entire dress. She wore a gown of mauve barège, little reddish\nbrown buskins, whose ribbons traced an X on her fine, white,\nopen-worked stockings, and that sort of muslin spencer, a Marseilles\ninvention, whose name, _canezou_, a corruption of the words _quinze\naoût_, pronounced after the fashion of the Canebière, signifies fine\nweather, heat, and midday. The three others, less timid, as we have\nalready said, wore low-necked dresses without disguise, which in\nsummer, beneath flower-adorned hats, are very graceful and enticing;\nbut by the side of these audacious outfits, blond Fantine’s _canezou_,\nwith its transparencies, its indiscretion, and its reticence,\nconcealing and displaying at one and the same time, seemed an alluring\ngodsend of decency, and the famous Court of Love, presided over by the\nVicomtesse de Cette, with the sea-green eyes, would, perhaps, have\nawarded the prize for coquetry to this _canezou_, in the contest for\nthe prize of modesty. The most ingenious is, at times, the wisest. This\ndoes happen.\n\nBrilliant of face, delicate of profile, with eyes of a deep blue, heavy\nlids, feet arched and small, wrists and ankles admirably formed, a\nwhite skin which, here and there allowed the azure branching of the\nveins to be seen, joy, a cheek that was young and fresh, the robust\nthroat of the Juno of Ægina, a strong and supple nape of the neck,\nshoulders modelled as though by Coustou, with a voluptuous dimple in\nthe middle, visible through the muslin; a gayety cooled by dreaminess;\nsculptural and exquisite—such was Fantine; and beneath these feminine\nadornments and these ribbons one could divine a statue, and in that\nstatue a soul.\n\nFantine was beautiful, without being too conscious of it. Those rare\ndreamers, mysterious priests of the beautiful who silently confront\neverything with perfection, would have caught a glimpse in this little\nworking-woman, through the transparency of her Parisian grace, of the\nancient sacred euphony. This daughter of the shadows was thoroughbred.\nShe was beautiful in the two ways—style and rhythm. Style is the form\nof the ideal; rhythm is its movement.\n\nWe have said that Fantine was joy; she was also modesty.\n\nTo an observer who studied her attentively, that which breathed from\nher athwart all the intoxication of her age, the season, and her love\naffair, was an invincible expression of reserve and modesty. She\nremained a little astonished. This chaste astonishment is the shade of\ndifference which separates Psyche from Venus. Fantine had the long,\nwhite, fine fingers of the vestal virgin who stirs the ashes of the\nsacred fire with a golden pin. Although she would have refused nothing\nto Tholomyès, as we shall have more than ample opportunity to see, her\nface in repose was supremely virginal; a sort of serious and almost\naustere dignity suddenly overwhelmed her at certain times, and there\nwas nothing more singular and disturbing than to see gayety become so\nsuddenly extinct there, and meditation succeed to cheerfulness without\nany transition state. This sudden and sometimes severely accentuated\ngravity resembled the disdain of a goddess. Her brow, her nose, her\nchin, presented that equilibrium of outline which is quite distinct\nfrom equilibrium of proportion, and from which harmony of countenance\nresults; in the very characteristic interval which separates the base\nof the nose from the upper lip, she had that imperceptible and charming\nfold, a mysterious sign of chastity, which makes Barberousse fall in\nlove with a Diana found in the treasures of Iconia.\n\nLove is a fault; so be it. Fantine was innocence floating high over\nfault.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—THOLOMYÈS IS SO MERRY THAT HE SINGS A SPANISH DITTY\n\n\nThat day was composed of dawn, from one end to the other. All nature\nseemed to be having a holiday, and to be laughing. The flower-beds of\nSaint-Cloud perfumed the air; the breath of the Seine rustled the\nleaves vaguely; the branches gesticulated in the wind, bees pillaged\nthe jasmines; a whole bohemia of butterflies swooped down upon the\nyarrow, the clover, and the sterile oats; in the august park of the\nKing of France there was a pack of vagabonds, the birds.\n\nThe four merry couples, mingled with the sun, the fields, the flowers,\nthe trees, were resplendent.\n\nAnd in this community of Paradise, talking, singing, running, dancing,\nchasing butterflies, plucking convolvulus, wetting their pink,\nopen-work stockings in the tall grass, fresh, wild, without malice, all\nreceived, to some extent, the kisses of all, with the exception of\nFantine, who was hedged about with that vague resistance of hers\ncomposed of dreaminess and wildness, and who was in love. “You always\nhave a queer look about you,” said Favourite to her.\n\nSuch things are joys. These passages of happy couples are a profound\nappeal to life and nature, and make a caress and light spring forth\nfrom everything. There was once a fairy who created the fields and\nforests expressly for those in love,—in that eternal hedge-school of\nlovers, which is forever beginning anew, and which will last as long as\nthere are hedges and scholars. Hence the popularity of spring among\nthinkers. The patrician and the knife-grinder, the duke and the peer,\nthe limb of the law, the courtiers and townspeople, as they used to say\nin olden times, all are subjects of this fairy. They laugh and hunt,\nand there is in the air the brilliance of an apotheosis—what a\ntransfiguration effected by love! Notaries’ clerks are gods. And the\nlittle cries, the pursuits through the grass, the waists embraced on\nthe fly, those jargons which are melodies, those adorations which burst\nforth in the manner of pronouncing a syllable, those cherries torn from\none mouth by another,—all this blazes forth and takes its place among\nthe celestial glories. Beautiful women waste themselves sweetly. They\nthink that this will never come to an end. Philosophers, poets,\npainters, observe these ecstasies and know not what to make of it, so\ngreatly are they dazzled by it. The departure for Cythera! exclaims\nWatteau; Lancret, the painter of plebeians, contemplates his bourgeois,\nwho have flitted away into the azure sky; Diderot stretches out his\narms to all these love idyls, and d’Urfé mingles druids with them.\n\nAfter breakfast the four couples went to what was then called the\nKing’s Square to see a newly arrived plant from India, whose name\nescapes our memory at this moment, and which, at that epoch, was\nattracting all Paris to Saint-Cloud. It was an odd and charming shrub\nwith a long stem, whose numerous branches, bristling and leafless and\nas fine as threads, were covered with a million tiny white rosettes;\nthis gave the shrub the air of a head of hair studded with flowers.\nThere was always an admiring crowd about it.\n\nAfter viewing the shrub, Tholomyès exclaimed, “I offer you asses!” and\nhaving agreed upon a price with the owner of the asses, they returned\nby way of Vanvres and Issy. At Issy an incident occurred. The truly\nnational park, at that time owned by Bourguin the contractor, happened\nto be wide open. They passed the gates, visited the manikin anchorite\nin his grotto, tried the mysterious little effects of the famous\ncabinet of mirrors, the wanton trap worthy of a satyr become a\nmillionaire or of Turcaret metamorphosed into a Priapus. They had\nstoutly shaken the swing attached to the two chestnut-trees celebrated\nby the Abbé de Bernis. As he swung these beauties, one after the other,\nproducing folds in the fluttering skirts which Greuze would have found\nto his taste, amid peals of laughter, the Toulousan Tholomyès, who was\nsomewhat of a Spaniard, Toulouse being the cousin of Tolosa, sang, to a\nmelancholy chant, the old ballad _gallega_, probably inspired by some\nlovely maid dashing in full flight upon a rope between two trees:—\n\n“Soy de Badajoz,        “Badajoz is my home,\nAmor me llama,          And Love is my name;\nToda mi alma,             To my eyes in flame,\nEs en mi ojos,              All my soul doth come;\nPorque enseñas,         For instruction meet\nA tuas piernas.            I receive at thy feet”\n\n\nFantine alone refused to swing.\n\n“I don’t like to have people put on airs like that,” muttered\nFavourite, with a good deal of acrimony.\n\nAfter leaving the asses there was a fresh delight; they crossed the\nSeine in a boat, and proceeding from Passy on foot they reached the\nbarrier of l‘Étoile. They had been up since five o’clock that morning,\nas the reader will remember; but _bah! there is no such thing as\nfatigue on Sunday_, said Favourite; _on Sunday fatigue does not work_.\n\nAbout three o’clock the four couples, frightened at their happiness,\nwere sliding down the Russian mountains, a singular edifice which then\noccupied the heights of Beaujon, and whose undulating line was visible\nabove the trees of the Champs-Élysées.\n\nFrom time to time Favourite exclaimed:—\n\n“And the surprise? I claim the surprise.”\n\n\n“Patience,” replied Tholomyès.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—AT BOMBARDA’S\n\n\nThe Russian mountains having been exhausted, they began to think about\ndinner; and the radiant party of eight, somewhat weary at last, became\nstranded in Bombarda’s public house, a branch establishment which had\nbeen set up in the Champs-Élysées by that famous restaurant-keeper,\nBombarda, whose sign could then be seen in the Rue de Rivoli, near\nDelorme Alley.\n\nA large but ugly room, with an alcove and a bed at the end (they had\nbeen obliged to put up with this accommodation in view of the Sunday\ncrowd); two windows whence they could survey beyond the elms, the quay\nand the river; a magnificent August sunlight lightly touching the\npanes; two tables; upon one of them a triumphant mountain of bouquets,\nmingled with the hats of men and women; at the other the four couples\nseated round a merry confusion of platters, dishes, glasses, and\nbottles; jugs of beer mingled with flasks of wine; very little order on\nthe table, some disorder beneath it;\n\n“They made beneath the table\nA noise, a clatter of the feet that was abominable,”\n\n\nsays Molière.\n\nThis was the state which the shepherd idyl, begun at five o’clock in\nthe morning, had reached at half-past four in the afternoon. The sun\nwas setting; their appetites were satisfied.\n\nThe Champs-Élysées, filled with sunshine and with people, were nothing\nbut light and dust, the two things of which glory is composed. The\nhorses of Marly, those neighing marbles, were prancing in a cloud of\ngold. Carriages were going and coming. A squadron of magnificent\nbody-guards, with their clarions at their head, were descending the\nAvenue de Neuilly; the white flag, showing faintly rosy in the setting\nsun, floated over the dome of the Tuileries. The Place de la Concorde,\nwhich had become the Place Louis XV. once more, was choked with happy\npromenaders. Many wore the silver fleur-de-lys suspended from the\nwhite-watered ribbon, which had not yet wholly disappeared from\nbutton-holes in the year 1817. Here and there choruses of little girls\nthrew to the winds, amid the passers-by, who formed into circles and\napplauded, the then celebrated Bourbon air, which was destined to\nstrike the Hundred Days with lightning, and which had for its refrain:—\n\n“Rendez-nous notre père de Gand,\nRendez-nous notre père.”\n\n“Give us back our father from Ghent,\nGive us back our father.”\n\n\nGroups of dwellers in the suburbs, in Sunday array, sometimes even\ndecorated with the fleur-de-lys, like the bourgeois, scattered over the\nlarge square and the Marigny square, were playing at rings and\nrevolving on the wooden horses; others were engaged in drinking; some\njourneyman printers had on paper caps; their laughter was audible.\nEverything was radiant. It was a time of undisputed peace and profound\nroyalist security; it was the epoch when a special and private report\nof Chief of Police Anglès to the King, on the subject of the suburbs of\nParis, terminated with these lines:—\n\n“Taking all things into consideration, Sire, there is nothing to be\nfeared from these people. They are as heedless and as indolent as cats.\nThe populace is restless in the provinces; it is not in Paris. These\nare very pretty men, Sire. It would take all of two of them to make one\nof your grenadiers. There is nothing to be feared on the part of the\npopulace of Paris the capital. It is remarkable that the stature of\nthis population should have diminished in the last fifty years; and the\npopulace of the suburbs is still more puny than at the time of the\nRevolution. It is not dangerous. In short, it is an amiable rabble.”\n\n\nPrefects of the police do not deem it possible that a cat can transform\nitself into a lion; that does happen, however, and in that lies the\nmiracle wrought by the populace of Paris. Moreover, the cat so despised\nby Count Anglès possessed the esteem of the republics of old. In their\neyes it was liberty incarnate; and as though to serve as pendant to the\nMinerva Aptera of the Piræus, there stood on the public square in\nCorinth the colossal bronze figure of a cat. The ingenuous police of\nthe Restoration beheld the populace of Paris in too “rose-colored” a\nlight; it is not so much of “an amiable rabble” as it is thought. The\nParisian is to the Frenchman what the Athenian was to the Greek: no one\nsleeps more soundly than he, no one is more frankly frivolous and lazy\nthan he, no one can better assume the air of forgetfulness; let him not\nbe trusted nevertheless; he is ready for any sort of cool deed; but\nwhen there is glory at the end of it, he is worthy of admiration in\nevery sort of fury. Give him a pike, he will produce the 10th of\nAugust; give him a gun, you will have Austerlitz. He is Napoleon’s stay\nand Danton’s resource. Is it a question of country, he enlists; is it a\nquestion of liberty, he tears up the pavements. Beware! his hair filled\nwith wrath, is epic; his blouse drapes itself like the folds of a\nchlamys. Take care! he will make of the first Rue Grenétat which comes\nto hand Caudine Forks. When the hour strikes, this man of the faubourgs\nwill grow in stature; this little man will arise, and his gaze will be\nterrible, and his breath will become a tempest, and there will issue\nforth from that slender chest enough wind to disarrange the folds of\nthe Alps. It is, thanks to the suburban man of Paris, that the\nRevolution, mixed with arms, conquers Europe. He sings; it is his\ndelight. Proportion his song to his nature, and you will see! As long\nas he has for refrain nothing but _la Carmagnole_, he only overthrows\nLouis XVI.; make him sing the _Marseillaise_, and he will free the\nworld.\n\nThis note jotted down on the margin of Anglès’ report, we will return\nto our four couples. The dinner, as we have said, was drawing to its\nclose.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—A CHAPTER IN WHICH THEY ADORE EACH OTHER\n\n\nChat at table, the chat of love; it is as impossible to reproduce one\nas the other; the chat of love is a cloud; the chat at table is smoke.\n\nFameuil and Dahlia were humming. Tholomyès was drinking. Zéphine was\nlaughing, Fantine smiling, Listolier blowing a wooden trumpet which he\nhad purchased at Saint-Cloud.\n\nFavourite gazed tenderly at Blachevelle and said:—\n\n“Blachevelle, I adore you.”\n\n\nThis called forth a question from Blachevelle:—\n\n“What would you do, Favourite, if I were to cease to love you?”\n\n\n“I!” cried Favourite. “Ah! Do not say that even in jest! If you were to\ncease to love me, I would spring after you, I would scratch you, I\nshould rend you, I would throw you into the water, I would have you\narrested.”\n\n\nBlachevelle smiled with the voluptuous self-conceit of a man who is\ntickled in his self-love. Favourite resumed:—\n\n“Yes, I would scream to the police! Ah! I should not restrain myself,\nnot at all! Rabble!”\n\n\nBlachevelle threw himself back in his chair, in an ecstasy, and closed\nboth eyes proudly.\n\nDahlia, as she ate, said in a low voice to Favourite, amid the uproar:—\n\n“So you really idolize him deeply, that Blachevelle of yours?”\n\n\n“I? I detest him,” replied Favourite in the same tone, seizing her fork\nagain. “He is avaricious. I love the little fellow opposite me in my\nhouse. He is very nice, that young man; do you know him? One can see\nthat he is an actor by profession. I love actors. As soon as he comes\nin, his mother says to him: ‘Ah! mon Dieu! my peace of mind is gone.\nThere he goes with his shouting. But, my dear, you are splitting my\nhead!’ So he goes up to rat-ridden garrets, to black holes, as high as\nhe can mount, and there he sets to singing, declaiming, how do I know\nwhat? so that he can be heard downstairs! He earns twenty sous a day at\nan attorney’s by penning quibbles. He is the son of a former precentor\nof Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas. Ah! he is very nice. He idolizes me so,\nthat one day when he saw me making batter for some pancakes, he said to\nme: _‘Mamselle, make your gloves into fritters, and I will eat them.’_\nIt is only artists who can say such things as that. Ah! he is very\nnice. I am in a fair way to go out of my head over that little fellow.\nNever mind; I tell Blachevelle that I adore him—how I lie! Hey! How I\ndo lie!”\n\n\nFavourite paused, and then went on:—\n\n“I am sad, you see, Dahlia. It has done nothing but rain all summer;\nthe wind irritates me; the wind does not abate. Blachevelle is very\nstingy; there are hardly any green peas in the market; one does not\nknow what to eat. I have the spleen, as the English say, butter is so\ndear! and then you see it is horrible, here we are dining in a room\nwith a bed in it, and that disgusts me with life.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—THE WISDOM OF THOLOMYÈS\n\n\nIn the meantime, while some sang, the rest talked together tumultuously\nall at once; it was no longer anything but noise. Tholomyès intervened.\n\n“Let us not talk at random nor too fast,” he exclaimed. “Let us\nreflect, if we wish to be brilliant. Too much improvisation empties the\nmind in a stupid way. Running beer gathers no froth. No haste,\ngentlemen. Let us mingle majesty with the feast. Let us eat with\nmeditation; let us make haste slowly. Let us not hurry. Consider the\nspringtime; if it makes haste, it is done for; that is to say, it gets\nfrozen. Excess of zeal ruins peach-trees and apricot-trees. Excess of\nzeal kills the grace and the mirth of good dinners. No zeal, gentlemen!\nGrimod de la Reynière agrees with Talleyrand.”\n\n\nA hollow sound of rebellion rumbled through the group.\n\n“Leave us in peace, Tholomyès,” said Blachevelle.\n\n“Down with the tyrant!” said Fameuil.\n\n“Bombarda, Bombance, and Bambochel!” cried Listolier.\n\n“Sunday exists,” resumed Fameuil.\n\n“We are sober,” added Listolier.\n\n“Tholomyès,” remarked Blachevelle, “contemplate my calmness [_mon\ncalme_].”\n\n\n“You are the Marquis of that,” retorted Tholomyès.\n\nThis mediocre play upon words produced the effect of a stone in a pool.\nThe Marquis de Montcalm was at that time a celebrated royalist. All the\nfrogs held their peace.\n\n“Friends,” cried Tholomyès, with the accent of a man who had recovered\nhis empire, “Come to yourselves. This pun which has fallen from the\nskies must not be received with too much stupor. Everything which falls\nin that way is not necessarily worthy of enthusiasm and respect. The\npun is the dung of the mind which soars. The jest falls, no matter\nwhere; and the mind after producing a piece of stupidity plunges into\nthe azure depths. A whitish speck flattened against the rock does not\nprevent the condor from soaring aloft. Far be it from me to insult the\npun! I honor it in proportion to its merits; nothing more. All the most\naugust, the most sublime, the most charming of humanity, and perhaps\noutside of humanity, have made puns. Jesus Christ made a pun on St.\nPeter, Moses on Isaac, Æschylus on Polynices, Cleopatra on Octavius.\nAnd observe that Cleopatra’s pun preceded the battle of Actium, and\nthat had it not been for it, no one would have remembered the city of\nToryne, a Greek name which signifies a ladle. That once conceded, I\nreturn to my exhortation. I repeat, brothers, I repeat, no zeal, no\nhubbub, no excess; even in witticisms, gayety, jollities, or plays on\nwords. Listen to me. I have the prudence of Amphiaraüs and the baldness\nof Cæsar. There must be a limit, even to rebuses. _Est modus in rebus_.\n\n“There must be a limit, even to dinners. You are fond of apple\nturnovers, ladies; do not indulge in them to excess. Even in the matter\nof turnovers, good sense and art are requisite. Gluttony chastises the\nglutton, _Gula punit Gulax_. Indigestion is charged by the good God\nwith preaching morality to stomachs. And remember this: each one of our\npassions, even love, has a stomach which must not be filled too full.\nIn all things the word _finis_ must be written in good season;\nself-control must be exercised when the matter becomes urgent; the bolt\nmust be drawn on appetite; one must set one’s own fantasy to the\nviolin, and carry one’s self to the post. The sage is the man who knows\nhow, at a given moment, to effect his own arrest. Have some confidence\nin me, for I have succeeded to some extent in my study of the law,\naccording to the verdict of my examinations, for I know the difference\nbetween the question put and the question pending, for I have sustained\na thesis in Latin upon the manner in which torture was administered at\nRome at the epoch when Munatius Demens was quæstor of the Parricide;\nbecause I am going to be a doctor, apparently it does not follow that\nit is absolutely necessary that I should be an imbecile. I recommend\nyou to moderation in your desires. It is true that my name is Félix\nTholomyès; I speak well. Happy is he who, when the hour strikes, takes\na heroic resolve, and abdicates like Sylla or Origenes.”\n\n\nFavourite listened with profound attention.\n\n“Félix,” said she, “what a pretty word! I love that name. It is Latin;\nit means prosper.”\n\n\nTholomyès went on:—\n\n“Quirites, gentlemen, caballeros, my friends. Do you wish never to feel\nthe prick, to do without the nuptial bed, and to brave love? Nothing\nmore simple. Here is the receipt: lemonade, excessive exercise, hard\nlabor; work yourself to death, drag blocks, sleep not, hold vigil,\ngorge yourself with nitrous beverages, and potions of nymphæas; drink\nemulsions of poppies and agnus castus; season this with a strict diet,\nstarve yourself, and add thereto cold baths, girdles of herbs, the\napplication of a plate of lead, lotions made with the subacetate of\nlead, and fomentations of oxycrat.”\n\n\n“I prefer a woman,” said Listolier.\n\n“Woman,” resumed Tholomyès; “distrust her. Woe to him who yields\nhimself to the unstable heart of woman! Woman is perfidious and\ndisingenuous. She detests the serpent from professional jealousy. The\nserpent is the shop over the way.”\n\n\n“Tholomyès!” cried Blachevelle, “you are drunk!”\n\n\n“Pardieu,” said Tholomyès.\n\n“Then be gay,” resumed Blachevelle.\n\n“I agree to that,” responded Tholomyès.\n\nAnd, refilling his glass, he rose.\n\n“Glory to wine! _Nunc te, Bacche, canam!_ Pardon me ladies; that is\nSpanish. And the proof of it, señoras, is this: like people, like cask.\nThe arrobe of Castille contains sixteen litres; the cantaro of\nAlicante, twelve; the almude of the Canaries, twenty-five; the cuartin\nof the Balearic Isles, twenty-six; the boot of Tzar Peter, thirty. Long\nlive that Tzar who was great, and long live his boot, which was still\ngreater! Ladies, take the advice of a friend; make a mistake in your\nneighbor if you see fit. The property of love is to err. A love affair\nis not made to crouch down and brutalize itself like an English\nserving-maid who has callouses on her knees from scrubbing. It is not\nmade for that; it errs gayly, our gentle love. It has been said, error\nis human; I say, error is love. Ladies, I idolize you all. O Zéphine, O\nJoséphine, face more than irregular, you would be charming were you not\nall askew. You have the air of a pretty face upon which some one has\nsat down by mistake. As for Favourite, O nymphs and muses! one day when\nBlachevelle was crossing the gutter in the Rue Guérin-Boisseau, he\nespied a beautiful girl with white stockings well drawn up, which\ndisplayed her legs. This prologue pleased him, and Blachevelle fell in\nlove. The one he loved was Favourite. O Favourite, thou hast Ionian\nlips. There was a Greek painter named Euphorion, who was surnamed the\npainter of the lips. That Greek alone would have been worthy to paint\nthy mouth. Listen! before thee, there was never a creature worthy of\nthe name. Thou wert made to receive the apple like Venus, or to eat it\nlike Eve; beauty begins with thee. I have just referred to Eve; it is\nthou who hast created her. Thou deservest the letters-patent of the\nbeautiful woman. O Favourite, I cease to address you as ‘thou,’ because\nI pass from poetry to prose. You were speaking of my name a little\nwhile ago. That touched me; but let us, whoever we may be, distrust\nnames. They may delude us. I am called Félix, and I am not happy. Words\nare liars. Let us not blindly accept the indications which they afford\nus. It would be a mistake to write to Liège 2 for corks, and to Pau for\ngloves. Miss Dahlia, were I in your place, I would call myself Rosa. A\nflower should smell sweet, and woman should have wit. I say nothing of\nFantine; she is a dreamer, a musing, thoughtful, pensive person; she is\na phantom possessed of the form of a nymph and the modesty of a nun,\nwho has strayed into the life of a grisette, but who takes refuge in\nillusions, and who sings and prays and gazes into the azure without\nvery well knowing what she sees or what she is doing, and who, with her\neyes fixed on heaven, wanders in a garden where there are more birds\nthan are in existence. O Fantine, know this: I, Tholomyès, I am an\nillusion; but she does not even hear me, that blond maid of Chimeras!\nas for the rest, everything about her is freshness, suavity, youth,\nsweet morning light. O Fantine, maid worthy of being called Marguerite\nor Pearl, you are a woman from the beauteous Orient. Ladies, a second\npiece of advice: do not marry; marriage is a graft; it takes well or\nill; avoid that risk. But bah! what am I saying? I am wasting my words.\nGirls are incurable on the subject of marriage, and all that we wise\nmen can say will not prevent the waistcoat-makers and the\nshoe-stitchers from dreaming of husbands studded with diamonds. Well,\nso be it; but, my beauties, remember this, you eat too much sugar. You\nhave but one fault, O woman, and that is nibbling sugar. O nibbling\nsex, your pretty little white teeth adore sugar. Now, heed me well,\nsugar is a salt. All salts are withering. Sugar is the most desiccating\nof all salts; it sucks the liquids of the blood through the veins;\nhence the coagulation, and then the solidification of the blood; hence\ntubercles in the lungs, hence death. That is why diabetes borders on\nconsumption. Then, do not crunch sugar, and you will live. I turn to\nthe men: gentlemen, make conquest, rob each other of your well-beloved\nwithout remorse. Chassez across. In love there are no friends.\nEverywhere where there is a pretty woman hostility is open. No quarter,\nwar to the death! a pretty woman is a _casus belli_; a pretty woman is\nflagrant misdemeanor. All the invasions of history have been determined\nby petticoats. Woman is man’s right. Romulus carried off the Sabines;\nWilliam carried off the Saxon women; Cæsar carried off the Roman women.\nThe man who is not loved soars like a vulture over the mistresses of\nother men; and for my own part, to all those unfortunate men who are\nwidowers, I throw the sublime proclamation of Bonaparte to the army of\nItaly: “Soldiers, you are in need of everything; the enemy has it.”\n\n\nTholomyès paused.\n\n“Take breath, Tholomyès,” said Blachevelle.\n\nAt the same moment Blachevelle, supported by Listolier and Fameuil,\nstruck up to a plaintive air, one of those studio songs composed of the\nfirst words which come to hand, rhymed richly and not at all, as\ndestitute of sense as the gesture of the tree and the sound of the\nwind, which have their birth in the vapor of pipes, and are dissipated\nand take their flight with them. This is the couplet by which the group\nreplied to Tholomyès’ harangue:—\n\n“The father turkey-cocks so grave\nSome money to an agent gave,\nThat master good Clermont-Tonnerre\nMight be made pope on Saint Johns’ day fair.\nBut this good Clermont could not be\nMade pope, because no priest was he;\nAnd then their agent, whose wrath burned,\nWith all their money back returned.”\n\n\nThis was not calculated to calm Tholomyès’ improvisation; he emptied\nhis glass, filled, refilled it, and began again:—\n\n“Down with wisdom! Forget all that I have said. Let us be neither\nprudes nor prudent men nor prudhommes. I propose a toast to mirth; be\nmerry. Let us complete our course of law by folly and eating!\nIndigestion and the digest. Let Justinian be the male, and Feasting,\nthe female! Joy in the depths! Live, O creation! The world is a great\ndiamond. I am happy. The birds are astonishing. What a festival\neverywhere! The nightingale is a gratuitous Elleviou. Summer, I salute\nthee! O Luxembourg! O Georgics of the Rue Madame, and of the Allée de\nl’Observatoire! O pensive infantry soldiers! O all those charming\nnurses who, while they guard the children, amuse themselves! The pampas\nof America would please me if I had not the arcades of the Odéon. My\nsoul flits away into the virgin forests and to the savannas. All is\nbeautiful. The flies buzz in the sun. The sun has sneezed out the\nhumming bird. Embrace me, Fantine!”\n\n\nHe made a mistake and embraced Favourite.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—THE DEATH OF A HORSE\n\n\n“The dinners are better at Édon’s than at Bombarda’s,” exclaimed\nZéphine.\n\n“I prefer Bombarda to Édon,” declared Blachevelle. “There is more\nluxury. It is more Asiatic. Look at the room downstairs; there are\nmirrors [_glaces_] on the walls.”\n\n\n“I prefer them [_glaces_, ices] on my plate,” said Favourite.\n\nBlachevelle persisted:—\n\n“Look at the knives. The handles are of silver at Bombarda’s and of\nbone at Édon’s. Now, silver is more valuable than bone.”\n\n\n“Except for those who have a silver chin,” observed Tholomyès.\n\nHe was looking at the dome of the Invalides, which was visible from\nBombarda’s windows.\n\nA pause ensued.\n\n“Tholomyès,” exclaimed Fameuil, “Listolier and I were having a\ndiscussion just now.”\n\n\n“A discussion is a good thing,” replied Tholomyès; “a quarrel is\nbetter.”\n\n\n“We were disputing about philosophy.”\n\n\n“Well?”\n\n\n“Which do you prefer, Descartes or Spinoza?”\n\n\n“Désaugiers,” said Tholomyès.\n\nThis decree pronounced, he took a drink, and went on:—\n\n“I consent to live. All is not at an end on earth since we can still\ntalk nonsense. For that I return thanks to the immortal gods. We lie.\nOne lies, but one laughs. One affirms, but one doubts. The unexpected\nbursts forth from the syllogism. That is fine. There are still human\nbeings here below who know how to open and close the surprise box of\nthe paradox merrily. This, ladies, which you are drinking with so\ntranquil an air is Madeira wine, you must know, from the vineyard of\nCoural das Freiras, which is three hundred and seventeen fathoms above\nthe level of the sea. Attention while you drink! three hundred and\nseventeen fathoms! and Monsieur Bombarda, the magnificent eating-house\nkeeper, gives you those three hundred and seventeen fathoms for four\nfrancs and fifty centimes.”\n\n\nAgain Fameuil interrupted him:—\n\n“Tholomyès, your opinions fix the law. Who is your favorite author?”\n\n\n“Ber—”\n\n\n“Quin?”\n\n\n“No; Choux.”\n\n\nAnd Tholomyès continued:—\n\n“Honor to Bombarda! He would equal Munophis of Elephanta if he could\nbut get me an Indian dancing-girl, and Thygelion of Chæronea if he\ncould bring me a Greek courtesan; for, oh, ladies! there were Bombardas\nin Greece and in Egypt. Apuleius tells us of them. Alas! always the\nsame, and nothing new; nothing more unpublished by the creator in\ncreation! _Nil sub sole novum_, says Solomon; _amor omnibus idem_, says\nVirgil; and Carabine mounts with Carabin into the bark at Saint-Cloud,\nas Aspasia embarked with Pericles upon the fleet at Samos. One last\nword. Do you know what Aspasia was, ladies? Although she lived at an\nepoch when women had, as yet, no soul, she was a soul; a soul of a rosy\nand purple hue, more ardent hued than fire, fresher than the dawn.\nAspasia was a creature in whom two extremes of womanhood met; she was\nthe goddess prostitute; Socrates plus Manon Lescaut. Aspasia was\ncreated in case a mistress should be needed for Prometheus.”\n\n\nTholomyès, once started, would have found some difficulty in stopping,\nhad not a horse fallen down upon the quay just at that moment. The\nshock caused the cart and the orator to come to a dead halt. It was a\nBeauceron mare, old and thin, and one fit for the knacker, which was\ndragging a very heavy cart. On arriving in front of Bombarda’s, the\nworn-out, exhausted beast had refused to proceed any further. This\nincident attracted a crowd. Hardly had the cursing and indignant carter\nhad time to utter with proper energy the sacramental word, _Mâtin_ (the\njade), backed up with a pitiless cut of the whip, when the jade fell,\nnever to rise again. On hearing the hubbub made by the passers-by,\nTholomyès’ merry auditors turned their heads, and Tholomyès took\nadvantage of the opportunity to bring his allocution to a close with\nthis melancholy strophe:—\n\n“Elle était de ce monde ou coucous et carrosses\nOnt le même destin;\nEt, rosse, elle a vécu ce que vivant les rosses,\nL’espace d’un mâtin!” 3\n\n“Poor horse!” sighed Fantine.\n\nAnd Dahlia exclaimed:—\n\n“There is Fantine on the point of crying over horses. How can one be\nsuch a pitiful fool as that!”\n\n\nAt that moment Favourite, folding her arms and throwing her head back,\nlooked resolutely at Tholomyès and said:—\n\n“Come, now! the surprise?”\n\n\n“Exactly. The moment has arrived,” replied Tholomyès. “Gentlemen, the\nhour for giving these ladies a surprise has struck. Wait for us a\nmoment, ladies.”\n\n\n“It begins with a kiss,” said Blachevelle.\n\n“On the brow,” added Tholomyès.\n\nEach gravely bestowed a kiss on his mistress’s brow; then all four\nfiled out through the door, with their fingers on their lips.\n\nFavourite clapped her hands on their departure.\n\n“It is beginning to be amusing already,” said she.\n\n“Don’t be too long,” murmured Fantine; “we are waiting for you.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—A MERRY END TO MIRTH\n\n\nWhen the young girls were left alone, they leaned two by two on the\nwindow-sills, chatting, craning out their heads, and talking from one\nwindow to the other.\n\nThey saw the young men emerge from the Café Bombarda arm in arm. The\nlatter turned round, made signs to them, smiled, and disappeared in\nthat dusty Sunday throng which makes a weekly invasion into the\nChamps-Élysées.\n\n“Don’t be long!” cried Fantine.\n\n“What are they going to bring us?” said Zéphine.\n\n“It will certainly be something pretty,” said Dahlia.\n\n“For my part,” said Favourite, “I want it to be of gold.”\n\n\nTheir attention was soon distracted by the movements on the shore of\nthe lake, which they could see through the branches of the large trees,\nand which diverted them greatly.\n\nIt was the hour for the departure of the mail-coaches and diligences.\nNearly all the stage-coaches for the south and west passed through the\nChamps-Élysées. The majority followed the quay and went through the\nPassy Barrier. From moment to moment, some huge vehicle, painted yellow\nand black, heavily loaded, noisily harnessed, rendered shapeless by\ntrunks, tarpaulins, and valises, full of heads which immediately\ndisappeared, rushed through the crowd with all the sparks of a forge,\nwith dust for smoke, and an air of fury, grinding the pavements,\nchanging all the paving-stones into steels. This uproar delighted the\nyoung girls. Favourite exclaimed:—\n\n“What a row! One would say that it was a pile of chains flying away.”\n\n\nIt chanced that one of these vehicles, which they could only see with\ndifficulty through the thick elms, halted for a moment, then set out\nagain at a gallop. This surprised Fantine.\n\n“That’s odd!” said she. “I thought the diligence never stopped.”\n\n\nFavourite shrugged her shoulders.\n\n“This Fantine is surprising. I am coming to take a look at her out of\ncuriosity. She is dazzled by the simplest things. Suppose a case: I am\na traveller; I say to the diligence, ‘I will go on in advance; you\nshall pick me up on the quay as you pass.’ The diligence passes, sees\nme, halts, and takes me. That is done every day. You do not know life,\nmy dear.”\n\n\nIn this manner a certain time elapsed. All at once Favourite made a\nmovement, like a person who is just waking up.\n\n“Well,” said she, “and the surprise?”\n\n\n“Yes, by the way,” joined in Dahlia, “the famous surprise?”\n\n\n“They are a very long time about it!” said Fantine.\n\nAs Fantine concluded this sigh, the waiter who had served them at\ndinner entered. He held in his hand something which resembled a letter.\n\n“What is that?” demanded Favourite.\n\nThe waiter replied:—\n\n“It is a paper that those gentlemen left for these ladies.”\n\n\n“Why did you not bring it at once?”\n\n\n“Because,” said the waiter, “the gentlemen ordered me not to deliver it\nto the ladies for an hour.”\n\n\nFavourite snatched the paper from the waiter’s hand. It was, in fact, a\nletter.\n\n“Stop!” said she; “there is no address; but this is what is written on\nit—”\n\n\n“THIS IS THE SURPRISE.”\n\n\nShe tore the letter open hastily, opened it, and read [she knew how to\nread]:—\n\n“OUR BELOVED:—\n\n“You must know that we have parents. Parents—you do not know much about\nsuch things. They are called fathers and mothers by the civil code,\nwhich is puerile and honest. Now, these parents groan, these old folks\nimplore us, these good men and these good women call us prodigal sons;\nthey desire our return, and offer to kill calves for us. Being\nvirtuous, we obey them. At the hour when you read this, five fiery\nhorses will be bearing us to our papas and mammas. We are pulling up\nour stakes, as Bossuet says. We are going; we are gone. We flee in the\narms of Laffitte and on the wings of Caillard. The Toulouse diligence\ntears us from the abyss, and the abyss is you, O our little beauties!\nWe return to society, to duty, to respectability, at full trot, at the\nrate of three leagues an hour. It is necessary for the good of the\ncountry that we should be, like the rest of the world, prefects,\nfathers of families, rural police, and councillors of state. Venerate\nus. We are sacrificing ourselves. Mourn for us in haste, and replace us\nwith speed. If this letter lacerates you, do the same by it. Adieu.\n\n“For the space of nearly two years we have made you happy. We bear you\nno grudge for that.                                 “Signed:\nBLACHEVELLE.\nFAMUEIL.\nLISTOLIER.\nFÉLIX THOLOMYÈS.\n\n\n“_Postscriptum_. The dinner is paid for.”\n\n\nThe four young women looked at each other.\n\nFavourite was the first to break the silence.\n\n“Well!” she exclaimed, “it’s a very pretty farce, all the same.”\n\n\n“It is very droll,” said Zéphine.\n\n“That must have been Blachevelle’s idea,” resumed Favourite. “It makes\nme in love with him. No sooner is he gone than he is loved. This is an\nadventure, indeed.”\n\n\n“No,” said Dahlia; “it was one of Tholomyès’ ideas. That is evident.\n\n“In that case,” retorted Favourite, “death to Blachevelle, and long\nlive Tholomyès!”\n\n\n“Long live Tholomyès!” exclaimed Dahlia and Zéphine.\n\nAnd they burst out laughing.\n\nFantine laughed with the rest.\n\nAn hour later, when she had returned to her room, she wept. It was her\nfirst love affair, as we have said; she had given herself to this\nTholomyès as to a husband, and the poor girl had a child.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTH—TO CONFIDE IS SOMETIMES TO DELIVER INTO A PERSON’S POWER\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—ONE MOTHER MEETS ANOTHER MOTHER\n\n\nThere was, at Montfermeil, near Paris, during the first quarter of this\ncentury, a sort of cook-shop which no longer exists. This cook-shop was\nkept by some people named Thénardier, husband and wife. It was situated\nin Boulanger Lane. Over the door there was a board nailed flat against\nthe wall. Upon this board was painted something which resembled a man\ncarrying another man on his back, the latter wearing the big gilt\nepaulettes of a general, with large silver stars; red spots represented\nblood; the rest of the picture consisted of smoke, and probably\nrepresented a battle. Below ran this inscription: AT THE SIGN OF\nSERGEANT OF WATERLOO (_Au Sargent de Waterloo_).\n\nNothing is more common than a cart or a truck at the door of a\nhostelry. Nevertheless, the vehicle, or, to speak more accurately, the\nfragment of a vehicle, which encumbered the street in front of the\ncook-shop of the _Sergeant of Waterloo_, one evening in the spring of\n1818, would certainly have attracted, by its mass, the attention of any\npainter who had passed that way.\n\nIt was the fore-carriage of one of those trucks which are used in\nwooded tracts of country, and which serve to transport thick planks and\nthe trunks of trees. This fore-carriage was composed of a massive iron\naxle-tree with a pivot, into which was fitted a heavy shaft, and which\nwas supported by two huge wheels. The whole thing was compact,\noverwhelming, and misshapen. It seemed like the gun-carriage of an\nenormous cannon. The ruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels, the\nfellies, the hub, the axle, and the shaft, a layer of mud, a hideous\nyellowish daubing hue, tolerably like that with which people are fond\nof ornamenting cathedrals. The wood was disappearing under mud, and the\niron beneath rust. Under the axle-tree hung, like drapery, a huge\nchain, worthy of some Goliath of a convict. This chain suggested, not\nthe beams, which it was its office to transport, but the mastodons and\nmammoths which it might have served to harness; it had the air of the\ngalleys, but of cyclopean and superhuman galleys, and it seemed to have\nbeen detached from some monster. Homer would have bound Polyphemus with\nit, and Shakespeare, Caliban.\n\nWhy was that fore-carriage of a truck in that place in the street? In\nthe first place, to encumber the street; next, in order that it might\nfinish the process of rusting. There is a throng of institutions in the\nold social order, which one comes across in this fashion as one walks\nabout outdoors, and which have no other reasons for existence than the\nabove.\n\nThe centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle, and\nin the loop, as in the rope of a swing, there were seated and grouped,\non that particular evening, in exquisite interlacement, two little\ngirls; one about two years and a half old, the other, eighteen months;\nthe younger in the arms of the other. A handkerchief, cleverly knotted\nabout them, prevented their falling out. A mother had caught sight of\nthat frightful chain, and had said, “Come! there’s a plaything for my\nchildren.”\n\n\nThe two children, who were dressed prettily and with some elegance,\nwere radiant with pleasure; one would have said that they were two\nroses amid old iron; their eyes were a triumph; their fresh cheeks were\nfull of laughter. One had chestnut hair; the other, brown. Their\ninnocent faces were two delighted surprises; a blossoming shrub which\ngrew near wafted to the passers-by perfumes which seemed to emanate\nfrom them; the child of eighteen months displayed her pretty little\nbare stomach with the chaste indecency of childhood. Above and around\nthese two delicate heads, all made of happiness and steeped in light,\nthe gigantic fore-carriage, black with rust, almost terrible, all\nentangled in curves and wild angles, rose in a vault, like the entrance\nof a cavern. A few paces apart, crouching down upon the threshold of\nthe hostelry, the mother, not a very prepossessing woman, by the way,\nthough touching at that moment, was swinging the two children by means\nof a long cord, watching them carefully, for fear of accidents, with\nthat animal and celestial expression which is peculiar to maternity. At\nevery backward and forward swing the hideous links emitted a strident\nsound, which resembled a cry of rage; the little girls were in\necstasies; the setting sun mingled in this joy, and nothing could be\nmore charming than this caprice of chance which had made of a chain of\nTitans the swing of cherubim.\n\nAs she rocked her little ones, the mother hummed in a discordant voice\na romance then celebrated:—\n\n“It must be, said a warrior.”\n\n\nHer song, and the contemplation of her daughters, prevented her hearing\nand seeing what was going on in the street.\n\nIn the meantime, some one had approached her, as she was beginning the\nfirst couplet of the romance, and suddenly she heard a voice saying\nvery near her ear:—\n\n“You have two beautiful children there, Madame.”\n\n\n“To the fair and tender Imogene—”\n\n\nreplied the mother, continuing her romance; then she turned her head.\n\nA woman stood before her, a few paces distant. This woman also had a\nchild, which she carried in her arms.\n\nShe was carrying, in addition, a large carpet-bag, which seemed very\nheavy.\n\nThis woman’s child was one of the most divine creatures that it is\npossible to behold. It was a girl, two or three years of age. She could\nhave entered into competition with the two other little ones, so far as\nthe coquetry of her dress was concerned; she wore a cap of fine linen,\nribbons on her bodice, and Valenciennes lace on her cap. The folds of\nher skirt were raised so as to permit a view of her white, firm, and\ndimpled leg. She was admirably rosy and healthy. The little beauty\ninspired a desire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks. Of her\neyes nothing could be known, except that they must be very large, and\nthat they had magnificent lashes. She was asleep.\n\nShe slept with that slumber of absolute confidence peculiar to her age.\nThe arms of mothers are made of tenderness; in them children sleep\nprofoundly.\n\nAs for the mother, her appearance was sad and poverty-stricken. She was\ndressed like a working-woman who is inclined to turn into a peasant\nagain. She was young. Was she handsome? Perhaps; but in that attire it\nwas not apparent. Her hair, a golden lock of which had escaped, seemed\nvery thick, but was severely concealed beneath an ugly, tight, close,\nnun-like cap, tied under the chin. A smile displays beautiful teeth\nwhen one has them; but she did not smile. Her eyes did not seem to have\nbeen dry for a very long time. She was pale; she had a very weary and\nrather sickly appearance. She gazed upon her daughter asleep in her\narms with the air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child. A\nlarge blue handkerchief, such as the Invalides use, was folded into a\nfichu, and concealed her figure clumsily. Her hands were sunburnt and\nall dotted with freckles, her forefinger was hardened and lacerated\nwith the needle; she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff, a\nlinen gown, and coarse shoes. It was Fantine.\n\nIt was Fantine, but difficult to recognize. Nevertheless, on\nscrutinizing her attentively, it was evident that she still retained\nher beauty. A melancholy fold, which resembled the beginning of irony,\nwrinkled her right cheek. As for her toilette, that aerial toilette of\nmuslin and ribbons, which seemed made of mirth, of folly, and of music,\nfull of bells, and perfumed with lilacs had vanished like that\nbeautiful and dazzling hoar-frost which is mistaken for diamonds in the\nsunlight; it melts and leaves the branch quite black.\n\nTen months had elapsed since the “pretty farce.”\n\n\nWhat had taken place during those ten months? It can be divined.\n\nAfter abandonment, straightened circumstances. Fantine had immediately\nlost sight of Favourite, Zéphine and Dahlia; the bond once broken on\nthe side of the men, it was loosed between the women; they would have\nbeen greatly astonished had any one told them a fortnight later, that\nthey had been friends; there no longer existed any reason for such a\nthing. Fantine had remained alone. The father of her child gone,—alas!\nsuch ruptures are irrevocable,—she found herself absolutely isolated,\nminus the habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure. Drawn away by\nher _liaison_ with Tholomyès to disdain the pretty trade which she\nknew, she had neglected to keep her market open; it was now closed to\nher. She had no resource. Fantine barely knew how to read, and did not\nknow how to write; in her childhood she had only been taught to sign\nher name; she had a public letter-writer indite an epistle to\nTholomyès, then a second, then a third. Tholomyès replied to none of\nthem. Fantine heard the gossips say, as they looked at her child: “Who\ntakes those children seriously! One only shrugs one’s shoulders over\nsuch children!” Then she thought of Tholomyès, who had shrugged his\nshoulders over his child, and who did not take that innocent being\nseriously; and her heart grew gloomy toward that man. But what was she\nto do? She no longer knew to whom to apply. She had committed a fault,\nbut the foundation of her nature, as will be remembered, was modesty\nand virtue. She was vaguely conscious that she was on the verge of\nfalling into distress, and of gliding into a worse state. Courage was\nnecessary; she possessed it, and held herself firm. The idea of\nreturning to her native town of M. sur M. occurred to her. There, some\none might possibly know her and give her work; yes, but it would be\nnecessary to conceal her fault. In a confused way she perceived the\nnecessity of a separation which would be more painful than the first\none. Her heart contracted, but she took her resolution. Fantine, as we\nshall see, had the fierce bravery of life. She had already valiantly\nrenounced finery, had dressed herself in linen, and had put all her\nsilks, all her ornaments, all her ribbons, and all her laces on her\ndaughter, the only vanity which was left to her, and a holy one it was.\nShe sold all that she had, which produced for her two hundred francs;\nher little debts paid, she had only about eighty francs left. At the\nage of twenty-two, on a beautiful spring morning, she quitted Paris,\nbearing her child on her back. Any one who had seen these two pass\nwould have had pity on them. This woman had, in all the world, nothing\nbut her child, and the child had, in all the world, no one but this\nwoman. Fantine had nursed her child, and this had tired her chest, and\nshe coughed a little.\n\nWe shall have no further occasion to speak of M. Félix Tholomyès. Let\nus confine ourselves to saying, that, twenty years later, under King\nLouis Philippe, he was a great provincial lawyer, wealthy and\ninfluential, a wise elector, and a very severe juryman; he was still a\nman of pleasure.\n\nTowards the middle of the day, after having, from time to time, for the\nsake of resting herself, travelled, for three or four sous a league, in\nwhat was then known as the _Petites Voitures des Environs de Paris_,\nthe “little suburban coach service,” Fantine found herself at\nMontfermeil, in the alley Boulanger.\n\nAs she passed the Thénardier hostelry, the two little girls, blissful\nin the monster swing, had dazzled her in a manner, and she had halted\nin front of that vision of joy.\n\nCharms exist. These two little girls were a charm to this mother.\n\nShe gazed at them in much emotion. The presence of angels is an\nannouncement of Paradise. She thought that, above this inn, she beheld\nthe mysterious HERE of Providence. These two little creatures were\nevidently happy. She gazed at them, she admired them, in such emotion\nthat at the moment when their mother was recovering her breath between\ntwo couplets of her song, she could not refrain from addressing to her\nthe remark which we have just read:—\n\n“You have two pretty children, Madame.”\n\n\nThe most ferocious creatures are disarmed by caresses bestowed on their\nyoung.\n\nThe mother raised her head and thanked her, and bade the wayfarer sit\ndown on the bench at the door, she herself being seated on the\nthreshold. The two women began to chat.\n\n“My name is Madame Thénardier,” said the mother of the two little\ngirls. “We keep this inn.”\n\n\nThen, her mind still running on her romance, she resumed humming\nbetween her teeth:—\n\n“It must be so; I am a knight,\nAnd I am off to Palestine.”\n\n\nThis Madame Thénardier was a sandy-complexioned woman, thin and\nangular—the type of the soldier’s wife in all its unpleasantness; and\nwhat was odd, with a languishing air, which she owed to her perusal of\nromances. She was a simpering, but masculine creature. Old romances\nproduce that effect when rubbed against the imagination of cook-shop\nwoman. She was still young; she was barely thirty. If this crouching\nwoman had stood upright, her lofty stature and her frame of a\nperambulating colossus suitable for fairs, might have frightened the\ntraveller at the outset, troubled her confidence, and disturbed what\ncaused what we have to relate to vanish. A person who is seated instead\nof standing erect—destinies hang upon such a thing as that.\n\nThe traveller told her story, with slight modifications.\n\nThat she was a working-woman; that her husband was dead; that her work\nin Paris had failed her, and that she was on her way to seek it\nelsewhere, in her own native parts; that she had left Paris that\nmorning on foot; that, as she was carrying her child, and felt\nfatigued, she had got into the Villemomble coach when she met it; that\nfrom Villemomble she had come to Montfermeil on foot; that the little\none had walked a little, but not much, because she was so young, and\nthat she had been obliged to take her up, and the jewel had fallen\nasleep.\n\nAt this word she bestowed on her daughter a passionate kiss, which woke\nher. The child opened her eyes, great blue eyes like her mother’s, and\nlooked at—what? Nothing; with that serious and sometimes severe air of\nlittle children, which is a mystery of their luminous innocence in the\npresence of our twilight of virtue. One would say that they feel\nthemselves to be angels, and that they know us to be men. Then the\nchild began to laugh; and although the mother held fast to her, she\nslipped to the ground with the unconquerable energy of a little being\nwhich wished to run. All at once she caught sight of the two others in\nthe swing, stopped short, and put out her tongue, in sign of\nadmiration.\n\nMother Thénardier released her daughters, made them descend from the\nswing, and said:—\n\n“Now amuse yourselves, all three of you.”\n\n\nChildren become acquainted quickly at that age, and at the expiration\nof a minute the little Thénardiers were playing with the newcomer at\nmaking holes in the ground, which was an immense pleasure.\n\nThe newcomer was very gay; the goodness of the mother is written in the\ngayety of the child; she had seized a scrap of wood which served her\nfor a shovel, and energetically dug a cavity big enough for a fly. The\ngrave-digger’s business becomes a subject for laughter when performed\nby a child.\n\nThe two women pursued their chat.\n\n“What is your little one’s name?”\n\n\n“Cosette.”\n\n\nFor Cosette, read Euphrasie. The child’s name was Euphrasie. But out of\nEuphrasie the mother had made Cosette by that sweet and graceful\ninstinct of mothers and of the populace which changes Josepha into\nPepita, and Françoise into Sillette. It is a sort of derivative which\ndisarranges and disconcerts the whole science of etymologists. We have\nknown a grandmother who succeeded in turning Theodore into Gnon.\n\n“How old is she?”\n\n\n“She is going on three.”\n\n\n“That is the age of my eldest.”\n\n\nIn the meantime, the three little girls were grouped in an attitude of\nprofound anxiety and blissfulness; an event had happened; a big worm\nhad emerged from the ground, and they were afraid; and they were in\necstasies over it.\n\nTheir radiant brows touched each other; one would have said that there\nwere three heads in one aureole.\n\n“How easily children get acquainted at once!” exclaimed Mother\nThénardier; “one would swear that they were three sisters!”\n\n\nThis remark was probably the spark which the other mother had been\nwaiting for. She seized the Thénardier’s hand, looked at her fixedly,\nand said:—\n\n“Will you keep my child for me?”\n\n\nThe Thénardier made one of those movements of surprise which signify\nneither assent nor refusal.\n\nCosette’s mother continued:—\n\n“You see, I cannot take my daughter to the country. My work will not\npermit it. With a child one can find no situation. People are\nridiculous in the country. It was the good God who caused me to pass\nyour inn. When I caught sight of your little ones, so pretty, so clean,\nand so happy, it overwhelmed me. I said: ‘Here is a good mother. That\nis just the thing; that will make three sisters.’ And then, it will not\nbe long before I return. Will you keep my child for me?”\n\n\n“I must see about it,” replied the Thénardier.\n\n“I will give you six francs a month.”\n\n\nHere a man’s voice called from the depths of the cook-shop:—\n\n“Not for less than seven francs. And six months paid in advance.”\n\n\n“Six times seven makes forty-two,” said the Thénardier.\n\n“I will give it,” said the mother.\n\n“And fifteen francs in addition for preliminary expenses,” added the\nman’s voice.\n\n“Total, fifty-seven francs,” said Madame Thénardier. And she hummed\nvaguely, with these figures:—\n\n“It must be, said a warrior.”\n\n\n“I will pay it,” said the mother. “I have eighty francs. I shall have\nenough left to reach the country, by travelling on foot. I shall earn\nmoney there, and as soon as I have a little I will return for my\ndarling.”\n\n\nThe man’s voice resumed:—\n\n“The little one has an outfit?”\n\n\n“That is my husband,” said the Thénardier.\n\n“Of course she has an outfit, the poor treasure.—I understood perfectly\nthat it was your husband.—And a beautiful outfit, too! a senseless\noutfit, everything by the dozen, and silk gowns like a lady. It is\nhere, in my carpet-bag.”\n\n\n“You must hand it over,” struck in the man’s voice again.\n\n“Of course I shall give it to you,” said the mother. “It would be very\nqueer if I were to leave my daughter quite naked!”\n\n\nThe master’s face appeared.\n\n“That’s good,” said he.\n\nThe bargain was concluded. The mother passed the night at the inn, gave\nup her money and left her child, fastened her carpet-bag once more, now\nreduced in volume by the removal of the outfit, and light henceforth\nand set out on the following morning, intending to return soon. People\narrange such departures tranquilly; but they are despairs!\n\nA neighbor of the Thénardiers met this mother as she was setting out,\nand came back with the remark:—\n\n“I have just seen a woman crying in the street so that it was enough to\nrend your heart.”\n\n\nWhen Cosette’s mother had taken her departure, the man said to the\nwoman:—\n\n“That will serve to pay my note for one hundred and ten francs which\nfalls due to-morrow; I lacked fifty francs. Do you know that I should\nhave had a bailiff and a protest after me? You played the mouse-trap\nnicely with your young ones.”\n\n\n“Without suspecting it,” said the woman.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—FIRST SKETCH OF TWO UNPREPOSSESSING FIGURES\n\n\nThe mouse which had been caught was a pitiful specimen; but the cat\nrejoices even over a lean mouse.\n\nWho were these Thénardiers?\n\nLet us say a word or two of them now. We will complete the sketch later\non.\n\nThese beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse people\nwho have been successful, and of intelligent people who have descended\nin the scale, which is between the class called “middle” and the class\ndenominated as “inferior,” and which combines some of the defects of\nthe second with nearly all the vices of the first, without possessing\nthe generous impulse of the workingman nor the honest order of the\nbourgeois.\n\nThey were of those dwarfed natures which, if a dull fire chances to\nwarm them up, easily become monstrous. There was in the woman a\nsubstratum of the brute, and in the man the material for a blackguard.\nBoth were susceptible, in the highest degree, of the sort of hideous\nprogress which is accomplished in the direction of evil. There exist\ncrab-like souls which are continually retreating towards the darkness,\nretrograding in life rather than advancing, employing experience to\naugment their deformity, growing incessantly worse, and becoming more\nand more impregnated with an ever-augmenting blackness. This man and\nwoman possessed such souls.\n\nThénardier, in particular, was troublesome for a physiognomist. One can\nonly look at some men to distrust them; for one feels that they are\ndark in both directions. They are uneasy in the rear and threatening in\nfront. There is something of the unknown about them. One can no more\nanswer for what they have done than for what they will do. The shadow\nwhich they bear in their glance denounces them. From merely hearing\nthem utter a word or seeing them make a gesture, one obtains a glimpse\nof sombre secrets in their past and of sombre mysteries in their\nfuture.\n\nThis Thénardier, if he himself was to be believed, had been a soldier—a\nsergeant, he said. He had probably been through the campaign of 1815,\nand had even conducted himself with tolerable valor, it would seem. We\nshall see later on how much truth there was in this. The sign of his\nhostelry was in allusion to one of his feats of arms. He had painted it\nhimself; for he knew how to do a little of everything, and badly.\n\nIt was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which, after\nhaving been _Clélie_, was no longer anything but _Lodoïska_, still\nnoble, but ever more and more vulgar, having fallen from Mademoiselle\nde Scudéri to Madame Bournon-Malarme, and from Madame de Lafayette to\nMadame Barthélemy-Hadot, was setting the loving hearts of the\nportresses of Paris aflame, and even ravaging the suburbs to some\nextent. Madame Thénardier was just intelligent enough to read this sort\nof books. She lived on them. In them she drowned what brains she\npossessed. This had given her, when very young, and even a little\nlater, a sort of pensive attitude towards her husband, a scamp of a\ncertain depth, a ruffian lettered to the extent of the grammar, coarse\nand fine at one and the same time, but, so far as sentimentalism was\nconcerned, given to the perusal of Pigault-Lebrun, and “in what\nconcerns the sex,” as he said in his jargon—a downright, unmitigated\nlout. His wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he was. Later\non, when her hair, arranged in a romantically drooping fashion, began\nto grow gray, when the Megæra began to be developed from the Pamela,\nthe female Thénardier was nothing but a coarse, vicious woman, who had\ndabbled in stupid romances. Now, one cannot read nonsense with\nimpunity. The result was that her eldest daughter was named Éponine; as\nfor the younger, the poor little thing came near being called Gulnare;\nI know not to what diversion, effected by a romance of Ducray-Dumenil,\nshe owed the fact that she merely bore the name of Azelma.\n\nHowever, we will remark by the way, everything was not ridiculous and\nsuperficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding, and which\nmay be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names. By the side of\nthis romantic element which we have just indicated there is the social\nsymptom. It is not rare for the neatherd’s boy nowadays to bear the\nname of Arthur, Alfred, or Alphonse, and for the vicomte—if there are\nstill any vicomtes—to be called Thomas, Pierre, or Jacques. This\ndisplacement, which places the “elegant” name on the plebeian and the\nrustic name on the aristocrat, is nothing else than an eddy of\nequality. The irresistible penetration of the new inspiration is there\nas everywhere else. Beneath this apparent discord there is a great and\na profound thing,—the French Revolution.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—THE LARK\n\n\nIt is not all in all sufficient to be wicked in order to prosper. The\ncook-shop was in a bad way.\n\nThanks to the traveller’s fifty-seven francs, Thénardier had been able\nto avoid a protest and to honor his signature. On the following month\nthey were again in need of money. The woman took Cosette’s outfit to\nParis, and pawned it at the pawnbroker’s for sixty francs. As soon as\nthat sum was spent, the Thénardiers grew accustomed to look on the\nlittle girl merely as a child whom they were caring for out of charity;\nand they treated her accordingly. As she had no longer any clothes,\nthey dressed her in the cast-off petticoats and chemises of the\nThénardier brats; that is to say, in rags. They fed her on what all the\nrest had left—a little better than the dog, a little worse than the\ncat. Moreover, the cat and the dog were her habitual table-companions;\nCosette ate with them under the table, from a wooden bowl similar to\ntheirs.\n\nThe mother, who had established herself, as we shall see later on, at\nM. sur M., wrote, or, more correctly, caused to be written, a letter\nevery month, that she might have news of her child. The Thénardiers\nreplied invariably, “Cosette is doing wonderfully well.”\n\n\nAt the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francs\nfor the seventh month, and continued her remittances with tolerable\nregularity from month to month. The year was not completed when\nThénardier said: “A fine favor she is doing us, in sooth! What does she\nexpect us to do with her seven francs?” and he wrote to demand twelve\nfrancs. The mother, whom they had persuaded into the belief that her\nchild was happy, “and was coming on well,” submitted, and forwarded the\ntwelve francs.\n\nCertain natures cannot love on the one hand without hating on the\nother. Mother Thénardier loved her two daughters passionately, which\ncaused her to hate the stranger.\n\nIt is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainous\naspects. Little as was the space occupied by Cosette, it seemed to her\nas though it were taken from her own, and that that little child\ndiminished the air which her daughters breathed. This woman, like many\nwomen of her sort, had a load of caresses and a burden of blows and\ninjuries to dispense each day. If she had not had Cosette, it is\ncertain that her daughters, idolized as they were, would have received\nthe whole of it; but the stranger did them the service to divert the\nblows to herself. Her daughters received nothing but caresses. Cosette\ncould not make a motion which did not draw down upon her head a heavy\nshower of violent blows and unmerited chastisement. The sweet, feeble\nbeing, who should not have understood anything of this world or of God,\nincessantly punished, scolded, ill-used, beaten, and seeing beside her\ntwo little creatures like herself, who lived in a ray of dawn!\n\nMadame Thénardier was vicious with Cosette. Éponine and Azelma were\nvicious. Children at that age are only copies of their mother. The size\nis smaller; that is all.\n\nA year passed; then another.\n\nPeople in the village said:—\n\n“Those Thénardiers are good people. They are not rich, and yet they are\nbringing up a poor child who was abandoned on their hands!”\n\n\nThey thought that Cosette’s mother had forgotten her.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Thénardier, having learned, it is impossible to say\nby what obscure means, that the child was probably a bastard, and that\nthe mother could not acknowledge it, exacted fifteen francs a month,\nsaying that “the creature” was growing and “eating,” and threatening to\nsend her away. “Let her not bother me,” he exclaimed, “or I’ll fire her\nbrat right into the middle of her secrets. I must have an increase.”\nThe mother paid the fifteen francs.\n\nFrom year to year the child grew, and so did her wretchedness.\n\nAs long as Cosette was little, she was the scape-goat of the two other\nchildren; as soon as she began to develop a little, that is to say,\nbefore she was even five years old, she became the servant of the\nhousehold.\n\nFive years old! the reader will say; that is not probable. Alas! it is\ntrue. Social suffering begins at all ages. Have we not recently seen\nthe trial of a man named Dumollard, an orphan turned bandit, who, from\nthe age of five, as the official documents state, being alone in the\nworld, “worked for his living and stole”?\n\nCosette was made to run on errands, to sweep the rooms, the courtyard,\nthe street, to wash the dishes, to even carry burdens. The Thénardiers\nconsidered themselves all the more authorized to behave in this manner,\nsince the mother, who was still at M. sur M., had become irregular in\nher payments. Some months she was in arrears.\n\nIf this mother had returned to Montfermeil at the end of these three\nyears, she would not have recognized her child. Cosette, so pretty and\nrosy on her arrival in that house, was now thin and pale. She had an\nindescribably uneasy look. “The sly creature,” said the Thénardiers.\n\nInjustice had made her peevish, and misery had made her ugly. Nothing\nremained to her except her beautiful eyes, which inspired pain,\nbecause, large as they were, it seemed as though one beheld in them a\nstill larger amount of sadness.\n\nIt was a heart-breaking thing to see this poor child, not yet six years\nold, shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen, full of holes,\nsweeping the street before daylight, with an enormous broom in her tiny\nred hands, and a tear in her great eyes.\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nCossette Sweeping  1b4-1-cossette-sweeping\n\n\nShe was called the _Lark_ in the neighborhood. The populace, who are\nfond of these figures of speech, had taken a fancy to bestow this name\non this trembling, frightened, and shivering little creature, no bigger\nthan a bird, who was awake every morning before any one else in the\nhouse or the village, and was always in the street or the fields before\ndaybreak.\n\nOnly the little lark never sang.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTH—THE DESCENT\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE HISTORY OF A PROGRESS IN BLACK GLASS TRINKETS\n\n\nAnd in the meantime, what had become of that mother who according to\nthe people at Montfermeil, seemed to have abandoned her child? Where\nwas she? What was she doing?\n\nAfter leaving her little Cosette with the Thénardiers, she had\ncontinued her journey, and had reached M. sur M.\n\nThis, it will be remembered, was in 1818.\n\nFantine had quitted her province ten years before. M. sur M. had\nchanged its aspect. While Fantine had been slowly descending from\nwretchedness to wretchedness, her native town had prospered.\n\nAbout two years previously one of those industrial facts which are the\ngrand events of small districts had taken place.\n\nThis detail is important, and we regard it as useful to develop it at\nlength; we should almost say, to underline it.\n\nFrom time immemorial, M. sur M. had had for its special industry the\nimitation of English jet and the black glass trinkets of Germany. This\nindustry had always vegetated, on account of the high price of the raw\nmaterial, which reacted on the manufacture. At the moment when Fantine\nreturned to M. sur M., an unheard-of transformation had taken place in\nthe production of “black goods.” Towards the close of 1815 a man, a\nstranger, had established himself in the town, and had been inspired\nwith the idea of substituting, in this manufacture, gum-lac for resin,\nand, for bracelets in particular, slides of sheet-iron simply laid\ntogether, for slides of soldered sheet-iron.\n\nThis very small change had effected a revolution.\n\nThis very small change had, in fact, prodigiously reduced the cost of\nthe raw material, which had rendered it possible in the first place, to\nraise the price of manufacture, a benefit to the country; in the second\nplace, to improve the workmanship, an advantage to the consumer; in the\nthird place, to sell at a lower price, while trebling the profit, which\nwas a benefit to the manufacturer.\n\nThus three results ensued from one idea.\n\nIn less than three years the inventor of this process had become rich,\nwhich is good, and had made every one about him rich, which is better.\nHe was a stranger in the Department. Of his origin, nothing was known;\nof the beginning of his career, very little. It was rumored that he had\ncome to town with very little money, a few hundred francs at the most.\n\nIt was from this slender capital, enlisted in the service of an\ningenious idea, developed by method and thought, that he had drawn his\nown fortune, and the fortune of the whole countryside.\n\nOn his arrival at M. sur M. he had only the garments, the appearance,\nand the language of a workingman.\n\nIt appears that on the very day when he made his obscure entry into the\nlittle town of M. sur M., just at nightfall, on a December evening,\nknapsack on back and thorn club in hand, a large fire had broken out in\nthe town-hall. This man had rushed into the flames and saved, at the\nrisk of his own life, two children who belonged to the captain of the\ngendarmerie; this is why they had forgotten to ask him for his\npassport. Afterwards they had learned his name. He was called Father\nMadeleine.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—MADELEINE\n\n\nHe was a man about fifty years of age, who had a preoccupied air, and\nwho was good. That was all that could be said about him.\n\nThanks to the rapid progress of the industry which he had so admirably\nreconstructed, M. sur M. had become a rather important centre of trade.\nSpain, which consumes a good deal of black jet, made enormous purchases\nthere each year. M. sur M. almost rivalled London and Berlin in this\nbranch of commerce. Father Madeleine’s profits were such, that at the\nend of the second year he was able to erect a large factory, in which\nthere were two vast workrooms, one for the men, and the other for\nwomen. Any one who was hungry could present himself there, and was sure\nof finding employment and bread. Father Madeleine required of the men\ngood will, of the women pure morals, and of all, probity. He had\nseparated the work-rooms in order to separate the sexes, and so that\nthe women and girls might remain discreet. On this point he was\ninflexible. It was the only thing in which he was in a manner\nintolerant. He was all the more firmly set on this severity, since M.\nsur M., being a garrison town, opportunities for corruption abounded.\nHowever, his coming had been a boon, and his presence was a godsend.\nBefore Father Madeleine’s arrival, everything had languished in the\ncountry; now everything lived with a healthy life of toil. A strong\ncirculation warmed everything and penetrated everywhere. Slack seasons\nand wretchedness were unknown. There was no pocket so obscure that it\nhad not a little money in it; no dwelling so lowly that there was not\nsome little joy within it.\n\nFather Madeleine gave employment to every one. He exacted but one\nthing: Be an honest man. Be an honest woman.\n\nAs we have said, in the midst of this activity of which he was the\ncause and the pivot, Father Madeleine made his fortune; but a singular\nthing in a simple man of business, it did not seem as though that were\nhis chief care. He appeared to be thinking much of others, and little\nof himself. In 1820 he was known to have a sum of six hundred and\nthirty thousand francs lodged in his name with Laffitte; but before\nreserving these six hundred and thirty thousand francs, he had spent\nmore than a million for the town and its poor.\n\nThe hospital was badly endowed; he founded six beds there. M. sur M. is\ndivided into the upper and the lower town. The lower town, in which he\nlived, had but one school, a miserable hovel, which was falling to\nruin: he constructed two, one for girls, the other for boys. He\nallotted a salary from his own funds to the two instructors, a salary\ntwice as large as their meagre official salary, and one day he said to\nsome one who expressed surprise, “The two prime functionaries of the\nstate are the nurse and the schoolmaster.” He created at his own\nexpense an infant school, a thing then almost unknown in France, and a\nfund for aiding old and infirm workmen. As his factory was a centre, a\nnew quarter, in which there were a good many indigent families, rose\nrapidly around him; he established there a free dispensary.\n\nAt first, when they watched his beginnings, the good souls said, “He’s\na jolly fellow who means to get rich.” When they saw him enriching the\ncountry before he enriched himself, the good souls said, “He is an\nambitious man.” This seemed all the more probable since the man was\nreligious, and even practised his religion to a certain degree, a thing\nwhich was very favorably viewed at that epoch. He went regularly to low\nmass every Sunday. The local deputy, who nosed out all rivalry\neverywhere, soon began to grow uneasy over this religion. This deputy\nhad been a member of the legislative body of the Empire, and shared the\nreligious ideas of a father of the Oratoire, known under the name of\nFouché, Duc d’Otrante, whose creature and friend he had been. He\nindulged in gentle raillery at God with closed doors. But when he\nbeheld the wealthy manufacturer Madeleine going to low mass at seven\no’clock, he perceived in him a possible candidate, and resolved to\noutdo him; he took a Jesuit confessor, and went to high mass and to\nvespers. Ambition was at that time, in the direct acceptation of the\nword, a race to the steeple. The poor profited by this terror as well\nas the good God, for the honorable deputy also founded two beds in the\nhospital, which made twelve.\n\nNevertheless, in 1819 a rumor one morning circulated through the town\nto the effect that, on the representations of the prefect and in\nconsideration of the services rendered by him to the country, Father\nMadeleine was to be appointed by the King, mayor of M. sur M. Those who\nhad pronounced this newcomer to be “an ambitious fellow,” seized with\ndelight on this opportunity which all men desire, to exclaim, “There!\nwhat did we say!” All M. sur M. was in an uproar. The rumor was well\nfounded. Several days later the appointment appeared in the _Moniteur_.\nOn the following day Father Madeleine refused.\n\nIn this same year of 1819 the products of the new process invented by\nMadeleine figured in the industrial exhibition; when the jury made\ntheir report, the King appointed the inventor a chevalier of the Legion\nof Honor. A fresh excitement in the little town. Well, so it was the\ncross that he wanted! Father Madeleine refused the cross.\n\nDecidedly this man was an enigma. The good souls got out of their\npredicament by saying, “After all, he is some sort of an adventurer.”\n\n\nWe have seen that the country owed much to him; the poor owed him\neverything; he was so useful and he was so gentle that people had been\nobliged to honor and respect him. His workmen, in particular, adored\nhim, and he endured this adoration with a sort of melancholy gravity.\nWhen he was known to be rich, “people in society” bowed to him, and he\nreceived invitations in the town; he was called, in town, Monsieur\nMadeleine; his workmen and the children continued to call him Father\nMadeleine, and that was what was most adapted to make him smile. In\nproportion as he mounted, throve, invitations rained down upon him.\n“Society” claimed him for its own. The prim little drawing-rooms on M.\nsur M., which, of course, had at first been closed to the artisan,\nopened both leaves of their folding-doors to the millionnaire. They\nmade a thousand advances to him. He refused.\n\nThis time the good gossips had no trouble. “He is an ignorant man, of\nno education. No one knows where he came from. He would not know how to\nbehave in society. It has not been absolutely proved that he knows how\nto read.”\n\n\nWhen they saw him making money, they said, “He is a man of business.”\nWhen they saw him scattering his money about, they said, “He is an\nambitious man.” When he was seen to decline honors, they said, “He is\nan adventurer.” When they saw him repulse society, they said, “He is a\nbrute.”\n\n\nIn 1820, five years after his arrival in M. sur M., the services which\nhe had rendered to the district were so dazzling, the opinion of the\nwhole country round about was so unanimous, that the King again\nappointed him mayor of the town. He again declined; but the prefect\nresisted his refusal, all the notabilities of the place came to implore\nhim, the people in the street besought him; the urging was so vigorous\nthat he ended by accepting. It was noticed that the thing which seemed\nchiefly to bring him to a decision was the almost irritated apostrophe\naddressed to him by an old woman of the people, who called to him from\nher threshold, in an angry way: _“A good mayor is a useful thing. Is he\ndrawing back before the good which he can do?”_\n\nThis was the third phase of his ascent. Father Madeleine had become\nMonsieur Madeleine. Monsieur Madeleine became Monsieur le Maire.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—SUMS DEPOSITED WITH LAFFITTE\n\n\nOn the other hand, he remained as simple as on the first day. He had\ngray hair, a serious eye, the sunburned complexion of a laborer, the\nthoughtful visage of a philosopher. He habitually wore a hat with a\nwide brim, and a long coat of coarse cloth, buttoned to the chin. He\nfulfilled his duties as mayor; but, with that exception, he lived in\nsolitude. He spoke to but few people. He avoided polite attentions; he\nescaped quickly; he smiled to relieve himself of the necessity of\ntalking; he gave, in order to get rid of the necessity for smiling. The\nwomen said of him, “What a good-natured bear!” His pleasure consisted\nin strolling in the fields.\n\nHe always took his meals alone, with an open book before him, which he\nread. He had a well-selected little library. He loved books; books are\ncold but safe friends. In proportion as leisure came to him with\nfortune, he seemed to take advantage of it to cultivate his mind. It\nhad been observed that, ever since his arrival at M. sur M., his\nlanguage had grown more polished, more choice, and more gentle with\nevery passing year. He liked to carry a gun with him on his strolls,\nbut he rarely made use of it. When he did happen to do so, his shooting\nwas something so infallible as to inspire terror. He never killed an\ninoffensive animal. He never shot at a little bird.\n\nAlthough he was no longer young, it was thought that he was still\nprodigiously strong. He offered his assistance to any one who was in\nneed of it, lifted a horse, released a wheel clogged in the mud, or\nstopped a runaway bull by the horns. He always had his pockets full of\nmoney when he went out; but they were empty on his return. When he\npassed through a village, the ragged brats ran joyously after him, and\nsurrounded him like a swarm of gnats.\n\nIt was thought that he must, in the past, have lived a country life,\nsince he knew all sorts of useful secrets, which he taught to the\npeasants. He taught them how to destroy scurf on wheat, by sprinkling\nit and the granary and inundating the cracks in the floor with a\nsolution of common salt; and how to chase away weevils by hanging up\norviot in bloom everywhere, on the walls and the ceilings, among the\ngrass and in the houses.\n\nHe had “recipes” for exterminating from a field, blight, tares,\nfoxtail, and all parasitic growths which destroy the wheat. He defended\na rabbit warren against rats, simply by the odor of a guinea-pig which\nhe placed in it.\n\nOne day he saw some country people busily engaged in pulling up\nnettles; he examined the plants, which were uprooted and already dried,\nand said: “They are dead. Nevertheless, it would be a good thing to\nknow how to make use of them. When the nettle is young, the leaf makes\nan excellent vegetable; when it is older, it has filaments and fibres\nlike hemp and flax. Nettle cloth is as good as linen cloth. Chopped up,\nnettles are good for poultry; pounded, they are good for horned cattle.\nThe seed of the nettle, mixed with fodder, gives gloss to the hair of\nanimals; the root, mixed with salt, produces a beautiful yellow\ncoloring-matter. Moreover, it is an excellent hay, which can be cut\ntwice. And what is required for the nettle? A little soil, no care, no\nculture. Only the seed falls as it is ripe, and it is difficult to\ncollect it. That is all. With the exercise of a little care, the nettle\ncould be made useful; it is neglected and it becomes hurtful. It is\nexterminated. How many men resemble the nettle!” He added, after a\npause: “Remember this, my friends: there are no such things as bad\nplants or bad men. There are only bad cultivators.”\n\n\nThe children loved him because he knew how to make charming little\ntrifles of straw and cocoanuts.\n\nWhen he saw the door of a church hung in black, he entered: he sought\nout funerals as other men seek christenings. Widowhood and the grief of\nothers attracted him, because of his great gentleness; he mingled with\nthe friends clad in mourning, with families dressed in black, with the\npriests groaning around a coffin. He seemed to like to give to his\nthoughts for text these funereal psalmodies filled with the vision of\nthe other world. With his eyes fixed on heaven, he listened with a sort\nof aspiration towards all the mysteries of the infinite, those sad\nvoices which sing on the verge of the obscure abyss of death.\n\nHe performed a multitude of good actions, concealing his agency in them\nas a man conceals himself because of evil actions. He penetrated houses\nprivately, at night; he ascended staircases furtively. A poor wretch on\nreturning to his attic would find that his door had been opened,\nsometimes even forced, during his absence. The poor man made a clamor\nover it: some malefactor had been there! He entered, and the first\nthing he beheld was a piece of gold lying forgotten on some piece of\nfurniture. The “malefactor” who had been there was Father Madeleine.\n\nHe was affable and sad. The people said: “There is a rich man who has\nnot a haughty air. There is a happy man who has not a contented air.”\n\n\nSome people maintained that he was a mysterious person, and that no one\never entered his chamber, which was a regular anchorite’s cell,\nfurnished with winged hour-glasses and enlivened by cross-bones and\nskulls of dead men! This was much talked of, so that one of the elegant\nand malicious young women of M. sur M. came to him one day, and asked:\n“Monsieur le Maire, pray show us your chamber. It is said to be a\ngrotto.” He smiled, and introduced them instantly into this “grotto.”\nThey were well punished for their curiosity. The room was very simply\nfurnished in mahogany, which was rather ugly, like all furniture of\nthat sort, and hung with paper worth twelve sous. They could see\nnothing remarkable about it, except two candlesticks of antique pattern\nwhich stood on the chimney-piece and appeared to be silver, “for they\nwere hall-marked,” an observation full of the type of wit of petty\ntowns.\n\nNevertheless, people continued to say that no one ever got into the\nroom, and that it was a hermit’s cave, a mysterious retreat, a hole, a\ntomb.\n\nIt was also whispered about that he had “immense” sums deposited with\nLaffitte, with this peculiar feature, that they were always at his\nimmediate disposal, so that, it was added, M. Madeleine could make his\nappearance at Laffitte’s any morning, sign a receipt, and carry off his\ntwo or three millions in ten minutes. In reality, “these two or three\nmillions” were reducible, as we have said, to six hundred and thirty or\nforty thousand francs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—M. MADELEINE IN MOURNING\n\n\nAt the beginning of 1820 the newspapers announced the death of M.\nMyriel, Bishop of D——, surnamed “Monseigneur Bienvenu,” who had died in\nthe odor of sanctity at the age of eighty-two.\n\nThe Bishop of D—— to supply here a detail which the papers omitted—had\nbeen blind for many years before his death, and content to be blind, as\nhis sister was beside him.\n\nLet us remark by the way, that to be blind and to be loved, is, in\nfact, one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness upon this\nearth, where nothing is complete. To have continually at one’s side a\nwoman, a daughter, a sister, a charming being, who is there because you\nneed her and because she cannot do without you; to know that we are\nindispensable to a person who is necessary to us; to be able to\nincessantly measure one’s affection by the amount of her presence which\nshe bestows on us, and to say to ourselves, “Since she consecrates the\nwhole of her time to me, it is because I possess the whole of her\nheart”; to behold her thought in lieu of her face; to be able to verify\nthe fidelity of one being amid the eclipse of the world; to regard the\nrustle of a gown as the sound of wings; to hear her come and go,\nretire, speak, return, sing, and to think that one is the centre of\nthese steps, of this speech; to manifest at each instant one’s personal\nattraction; to feel one’s self all the more powerful because of one’s\ninfirmity; to become in one’s obscurity, and through one’s obscurity,\nthe star around which this angel gravitates,—few felicities equal this.\nThe supreme happiness of life consists in the conviction that one is\nloved; loved for one’s own sake—let us say rather, loved in spite of\none’s self; this conviction the blind man possesses. To be served in\ndistress is to be caressed. Does he lack anything? No. One does not\nlose the sight when one has love. And what love! A love wholly\nconstituted of virtue! There is no blindness where there is certainty.\nSoul seeks soul, gropingly, and finds it. And this soul, found and\ntested, is a woman. A hand sustains you; it is hers: a mouth lightly\ntouches your brow; it is her mouth: you hear a breath very near you; it\nis hers. To have everything of her, from her worship to her pity, never\nto be left, to have that sweet weakness aiding you, to lean upon that\nimmovable reed, to touch Providence with one’s hands, and to be able to\ntake it in one’s arms,—God made tangible,—what bliss! The heart, that\nobscure, celestial flower, undergoes a mysterious blossoming. One would\nnot exchange that shadow for all brightness! The angel soul is there,\nuninterruptedly there; if she departs, it is but to return again; she\nvanishes like a dream, and reappears like reality. One feels warmth\napproaching, and behold! she is there. One overflows with serenity,\nwith gayety, with ecstasy; one is a radiance amid the night. And there\nare a thousand little cares. Nothings, which are enormous in that void.\nThe most ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed to lull you,\nand supplying the vanished universe to you. One is caressed with the\nsoul. One sees nothing, but one feels that one is adored. It is a\nparadise of shadows.\n\nIt was from this paradise that Monseigneur Welcome had passed to the\nother.\n\nThe announcement of his death was reprinted by the local journal of M.\nsur M. On the following day, M. Madeleine appeared clad wholly in\nblack, and with crape on his hat.\n\nThis mourning was noticed in the town, and commented on. It seemed to\nthrow a light on M. Madeleine’s origin. It was concluded that some\nrelationship existed between him and the venerable Bishop. _“He has\ngone into mourning for the Bishop of D——”_ said the drawing-rooms; this\nraised M. Madeleine’s credit greatly, and procured for him, instantly\nand at one blow, a certain consideration in the noble world of M. sur\nM. The microscopic Faubourg Saint-Germain of the place meditated\nraising the quarantine against M. Madeleine, the probable relative of a\nbishop. M. Madeleine perceived the advancement which he had obtained,\nby the more numerous courtesies of the old women and the more plentiful\nsmiles of the young ones. One evening, a ruler in that petty great\nworld, who was curious by right of seniority, ventured to ask him, “M.\nle Maire is doubtless a cousin of the late Bishop of D——?”\n\n\nHe said, “No, Madame.”\n\n\n“But,” resumed the dowager, “you are wearing mourning for him.”\n\n\nHe replied, “It is because I was a servant in his family in my youth.”\n\n\nAnother thing which was remarked, was, that every time that he\nencountered in the town a young Savoyard who was roaming about the\ncountry and seeking chimneys to sweep, the mayor had him summoned,\ninquired his name, and gave him money. The little Savoyards told each\nother about it: a great many of them passed that way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—VAGUE FLASHES ON THE HORIZON\n\n\nLittle by little, and in the course of time, all this opposition\nsubsided. There had at first been exercised against M. Madeleine, in\nvirtue of a sort of law which all those who rise must submit to,\nblackening and calumnies; then they grew to be nothing more than\nill-nature, then merely malicious remarks, then even this entirely\ndisappeared; respect became complete, unanimous, cordial, and towards\n1821 the moment arrived when the word “Monsieur le Maire” was\npronounced at M. sur M. with almost the same accent as “Monseigneur the\nBishop” had been pronounced in D—— in 1815. People came from a distance\nof ten leagues around to consult M. Madeleine. He put an end to\ndifferences, he prevented lawsuits, he reconciled enemies. Every one\ntook him for the judge, and with good reason. It seemed as though he\nhad for a soul the book of the natural law. It was like an epidemic of\nveneration, which in the course of six or seven years gradually took\npossession of the whole district.\n\nOne single man in the town, in the arrondissement, absolutely escaped\nthis contagion, and, whatever Father Madeleine did, remained his\nopponent as though a sort of incorruptible and imperturbable instinct\nkept him on the alert and uneasy. It seems, in fact, as though there\nexisted in certain men a veritable bestial instinct, though pure and\nupright, like all instincts, which creates antipathies and sympathies,\nwhich fatally separates one nature from another nature, which does not\nhesitate, which feels no disquiet, which does not hold its peace, and\nwhich never belies itself, clear in its obscurity, infallible,\nimperious, intractable, stubborn to all counsels of the intelligence\nand to all the dissolvents of reason, and which, in whatever manner\ndestinies are arranged, secretly warns the man-dog of the presence of\nthe man-cat, and the man-fox of the presence of the man-lion.\n\nIt frequently happened that when M. Madeleine was passing along a\nstreet, calm, affectionate, surrounded by the blessings of all, a man\nof lofty stature, clad in an iron-gray frock-coat, armed with a heavy\ncane, and wearing a battered hat, turned round abruptly behind him, and\nfollowed him with his eyes until he disappeared, with folded arms and a\nslow shake of the head, and his upper lip raised in company with his\nlower to his nose, a sort of significant grimace which might be\ntranslated by: “What is that man, after all? I certainly have seen him\nsomewhere. In any case, I am not his dupe.”\n\n\nThis person, grave with a gravity which was almost menacing, was one of\nthose men who, even when only seen by a rapid glimpse, arrest the\nspectator’s attention.\n\nHis name was Javert, and he belonged to the police.\n\nAt M. sur M. he exercised the unpleasant but useful functions of an\ninspector. He had not seen Madeleine’s beginnings. Javert owed the post\nwhich he occupied to the protection of M. Chabouillet, the secretary of\nthe Minister of State, Comte Anglès, then prefect of police at Paris.\nWhen Javert arrived at M. sur M. the fortune of the great manufacturer\nwas already made, and Father Madeleine had become Monsieur Madeleine.\n\nCertain police officers have a peculiar physiognomy, which is\ncomplicated with an air of baseness mingled with an air of authority.\nJavert possessed this physiognomy minus the baseness.\n\nIt is our conviction that if souls were visible to the eyes, we should\nbe able to see distinctly that strange thing that each one individual\nof the human race corresponds to some one of the species of the animal\ncreation; and we could easily recognize this truth, hardly perceived by\nthe thinker, that from the oyster to the eagle, from the pig to the\ntiger, all animals exist in man, and that each one of them is in a man.\nSometimes even several of them at a time.\n\nAnimals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues and our vices,\nstraying before our eyes, the visible phantoms of our souls. God shows\nthem to us in order to induce us to reflect. Only since animals are\nmere shadows, God has not made them capable of education in the full\nsense of the word; what is the use? On the contrary, our souls being\nrealities and having a goal which is appropriate to them, God has\nbestowed on them intelligence; that is to say, the possibility of\neducation. Social education, when well done, can always draw from a\nsoul, of whatever sort it may be, the utility which it contains.\n\nThis, be it said, is of course from the restricted point of view of the\nterrestrial life which is apparent, and without prejudging the profound\nquestion of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings which\nare not man. The visible _I_ in nowise authorizes the thinker to deny\nthe latent _I_. Having made this reservation, let us pass on.\n\nNow, if the reader will admit, for a moment, with us, that in every man\nthere is one of the animal species of creation, it will be easy for us\nto say what there was in Police Officer Javert.\n\nThe peasants of Asturias are convinced that in every litter of wolves\nthere is one dog, which is killed by the mother because, otherwise, as\nhe grew up, he would devour the other little ones.\n\nGive to this dog-son of a wolf a human face, and the result will be\nJavert.\n\nJavert had been born in prison, of a fortune-teller, whose husband was\nin the galleys. As he grew up, he thought that he was outside the pale\nof society, and he despaired of ever re-entering it. He observed that\nsociety unpardoningly excludes two classes of men,—those who attack it\nand those who guard it; he had no choice except between these two\nclasses; at the same time, he was conscious of an indescribable\nfoundation of rigidity, regularity, and probity, complicated with an\ninexpressible hatred for the race of bohemians whence he was sprung. He\nentered the police; he succeeded there. At forty years of age he was an\ninspector.\n\nDuring his youth he had been employed in the convict establishments of\nthe South.\n\nBefore proceeding further, let us come to an understanding as to the\nwords, “human face,” which we have just applied to Javert.\n\nThe human face of Javert consisted of a flat nose, with two deep\nnostrils, towards which enormous whiskers ascended on his cheeks. One\nfelt ill at ease when he saw these two forests and these two caverns\nfor the first time. When Javert laughed,—and his laugh was rare and\nterrible,—his thin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth,\nbut his gums, and around his nose there formed a flattened and savage\nfold, as on the muzzle of a wild beast. Javert, serious, was a\nwatchdog; when he laughed, he was a tiger. As for the rest, he had very\nlittle skull and a great deal of jaw; his hair concealed his forehead\nand fell over his eyebrows; between his eyes there was a permanent,\ncentral frown, like an imprint of wrath; his gaze was obscure; his\nmouth pursed up and terrible; his air that of ferocious command.\n\nThis man was composed of two very simple and two very good sentiments,\ncomparatively; but he rendered them almost bad, by dint of exaggerating\nthem,—respect for authority, hatred of rebellion; and in his eyes,\nmurder, robbery, all crimes, are only forms of rebellion. He enveloped\nin a blind and profound faith every one who had a function in the\nstate, from the prime minister to the rural policeman. He covered with\nscorn, aversion, and disgust every one who had once crossed the legal\nthreshold of evil. He was absolute, and admitted no exceptions. On the\none hand, he said, “The functionary can make no mistake; the magistrate\nis never the wrong.” On the other hand, he said, “These men are\nirremediably lost. Nothing good can come from them.” He fully shared\nthe opinion of those extreme minds which attribute to human law I know\nnot what power of making, or, if the reader will have it so, of\nauthenticating, demons, and who place a Styx at the base of society. He\nwas stoical, serious, austere; a melancholy dreamer, humble and\nhaughty, like fanatics. His glance was like a gimlet, cold and\npiercing. His whole life hung on these two words: watchfulness and\nsupervision. He had introduced a straight line into what is the most\ncrooked thing in the world; he possessed the conscience of his\nusefulness, the religion of his functions, and he was a spy as other\nmen are priests. Woe to the man who fell into his hands! He would have\narrested his own father, if the latter had escaped from the galleys,\nand would have denounced his mother, if she had broken her ban. And he\nwould have done it with that sort of inward satisfaction which is\nconferred by virtue. And, withal, a life of privation, isolation,\nabnegation, chastity, with never a diversion. It was implacable duty;\nthe police understood, as the Spartans understood Sparta, a pitiless\nlying in wait, a ferocious honesty, a marble informer, Brutus in\nVidocq.\n\nJavert’s whole person was expressive of the man who spies and who\nwithdraws himself from observation. The mystical school of Joseph de\nMaistre, which at that epoch seasoned with lofty cosmogony those things\nwhich were called the ultra newspapers, would not have failed to\ndeclare that Javert was a symbol. His brow was not visible; it\ndisappeared beneath his hat: his eyes were not visible, since they were\nlost under his eyebrows: his chin was not visible, for it was plunged\nin his cravat: his hands were not visible; they were drawn up in his\nsleeves: and his cane was not visible; he carried it under his coat.\nBut when the occasion presented itself, there was suddenly seen to\nemerge from all this shadow, as from an ambuscade, a narrow and angular\nforehead, a baleful glance, a threatening chin, enormous hands, and a\nmonstrous cudgel.\n\nIn his leisure moments, which were far from frequent, he read, although\nhe hated books; this caused him to be not wholly illiterate. This could\nbe recognized by some emphasis in his speech.\n\nAs we have said, he had no vices. When he was pleased with himself, he\npermitted himself a pinch of snuff. Therein lay his connection with\nhumanity.\n\nThe reader will have no difficulty in understanding that Javert was the\nterror of that whole class which the annual statistics of the Ministry\nof Justice designates under the rubric, Vagrants. The name of Javert\nrouted them by its mere utterance; the face of Javert petrified them at\nsight.\n\nSuch was this formidable man.\n\nJavert was like an eye constantly fixed on M. Madeleine. An eye full of\nsuspicion and conjecture. M. Madeleine had finally perceived the fact;\nbut it seemed to be of no importance to him. He did not even put a\nquestion to Javert; he neither sought nor avoided him; he bore that\nembarrassing and almost oppressive gaze without appearing to notice it.\nHe treated Javert with ease and courtesy, as he did all the rest of the\nworld.\n\nIt was divined, from some words which escaped Javert, that he had\nsecretly investigated, with that curiosity which belongs to the race,\nand into which there enters as much instinct as will, all the anterior\ntraces which Father Madeleine might have left elsewhere. He seemed to\nknow, and he sometimes said in covert words, that some one had gleaned\ncertain information in a certain district about a family which had\ndisappeared. Once he chanced to say, as he was talking to himself, “I\nthink I have him!” Then he remained pensive for three days, and uttered\nnot a word. It seemed that the thread which he thought he held had\nbroken.\n\nMoreover, and this furnishes the necessary corrective for the too\nabsolute sense which certain words might present, there can be nothing\nreally infallible in a human creature, and the peculiarity of instinct\nis that it can become confused, thrown off the track, and defeated.\nOtherwise, it would be superior to intelligence, and the beast would be\nfound to be provided with a better light than man.\n\nJavert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by the perfect naturalness\nand tranquillity of M. Madeleine.\n\nOne day, nevertheless, his strange manner appeared to produce an\nimpression on M. Madeleine. It was on the following occasion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—FATHER FAUCHELEVENT\n\n\nOne morning M. Madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of M. sur\nM.; he heard a noise, and saw a group some distance away. He\napproached. An old man named Father Fauchelevent had just fallen\nbeneath his cart, his horse having tumbled down.\n\nThis Fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom M. Madeleine had at\nthat time. When Madeleine arrived in the neighborhood, Fauchelevent, an\nex-notary and a peasant who was almost educated, had a business which\nwas beginning to be in a bad way. Fauchelevent had seen this simple\nworkman grow rich, while he, a lawyer, was being ruined. This had\nfilled him with jealousy, and he had done all he could, on every\noccasion, to injure Madeleine. Then bankruptcy had come; and as the old\nman had nothing left but a cart and a horse, and neither family nor\nchildren, he had turned carter.\n\nThe horse had two broken legs and could not rise. The old man was\ncaught in the wheels. The fall had been so unlucky that the whole\nweight of the vehicle rested on his breast. The cart was quite heavily\nladen. Father Fauchelevent was rattling in the throat in the most\nlamentable manner. They had tried, but in vain, to drag him out. An\nunmethodical effort, aid awkwardly given, a wrong shake, might kill\nhim. It was impossible to disengage him otherwise than by lifting the\nvehicle off of him. Javert, who had come up at the moment of the\naccident, had sent for a jack-screw.\n\nM. Madeleine arrived. People stood aside respectfully.\n\n“Help!” cried old Fauchelevent. “Who will be good and save the old\nman?”\n\n\nM. Madeleine turned towards those present:—\n\n“Is there a jack-screw to be had?”\n\n\n“One has been sent for,” answered the peasant.\n\n“How long will it take to get it?”\n\n\n“They have gone for the nearest, to Flachot’s place, where there is a\nfarrier; but it makes no difference; it will take a good quarter of an\nhour.”\n\n\n“A quarter of an hour!” exclaimed Madeleine.\n\nIt had rained on the preceding night; the soil was soaked.\n\nThe cart was sinking deeper into the earth every moment, and crushing\nthe old carter’s breast more and more. It was evident that his ribs\nwould be broken in five minutes more.\n\n“It is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour,” said Madeleine\nto the peasants, who were staring at him.\n\n“We must!”\n\n\n“But it will be too late then! Don’t you see that the cart is sinking?”\n\n\n“Well!”\n\n\n“Listen,” resumed Madeleine; “there is still room enough under the cart\nto allow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back. Only\nhalf a minute, and the poor man can be taken out. Is there any one here\nwho has stout loins and heart? There are five louis d’or to be earned!”\n\n\nNot a man in the group stirred.\n\n“Ten louis,” said Madeleine.\n\nThe persons present dropped their eyes. One of them muttered: “A man\nwould need to be devilish strong. And then he runs the risk of getting\ncrushed!”\n\n\n“Come,” began Madeleine again, “twenty louis.”\n\n\nThe same silence.\n\n“It is not the will which is lacking,” said a voice.\n\nM. Madeleine turned round, and recognized Javert. He had not noticed\nhim on his arrival.\n\nJavert went on:—\n\n“It is strength. One would have to be a terrible man to do such a thing\nas lift a cart like that on his back.”\n\n\nThen, gazing fixedly at M. Madeleine, he went on, emphasizing every\nword that he uttered:—\n\n“Monsieur Madeleine, I have never known but one man capable of doing\nwhat you ask.”\n\n\nMadeleine shuddered.\n\nJavert added, with an air of indifference, but without removing his\neyes from Madeleine:—\n\n“He was a convict.”\n\n\n“Ah!” said Madeleine.\n\n“In the galleys at Toulon.”\n\n\nMadeleine turned pale.\n\nMeanwhile, the cart continued to sink slowly. Father Fauchelevent\nrattled in the throat, and shrieked:—\n\n“I am strangling! My ribs are breaking! a screw! something! Ah!”\n\n\nMadeleine glanced about him.\n\n“Is there, then, no one who wishes to earn twenty louis and save the\nlife of this poor old man?”\n\n\nNo one stirred. Javert resumed:—\n\n“I have never known but one man who could take the place of a screw,\nand he was that convict.”\n\n\n“Ah! It is crushing me!” cried the old man.\n\nMadeleine raised his head, met Javert’s falcon eye still fixed upon\nhim, looked at the motionless peasants, and smiled sadly. Then, without\nsaying a word, he fell on his knees, and before the crowd had even had\ntime to utter a cry, he was underneath the vehicle.\n\nA terrible moment of expectation and silence ensued.\n\nThey beheld Madeleine, almost flat on his stomach beneath that terrible\nweight, make two vain efforts to bring his knees and his elbows\ntogether. They shouted to him, “Father Madeleine, come out!” Old\nFauchelevent himself said to him, “Monsieur Madeleine, go away! You see\nthat I am fated to die! Leave me! You will get yourself crushed also!”\nMadeleine made no reply.\n\nAll the spectators were panting. The wheels had continued to sink, and\nit had become almost impossible for Madeleine to make his way from\nunder the vehicle.\n\nSuddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver, the cart rose slowly,\nthe wheels half emerged from the ruts. They heard a stifled voice\ncrying, “Make haste! Help!” It was Madeleine, who had just made a final\neffort.\n\nThey rushed forwards. The devotion of a single man had given force and\ncourage to all. The cart was raised by twenty arms. Old Fauchelevent\nwas saved.\n\nMadeleine rose. He was pale, though dripping with perspiration. His\nclothes were torn and covered with mud. All wept. The old man kissed\nhis knees and called him the good God. As for him, he bore upon his\ncountenance an indescribable expression of happy and celestial\nsuffering, and he fixed his tranquil eye on Javert, who was still\nstaring at him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—FAUCHELEVENT BECOMES A GARDENER IN PARIS\n\n\nFauchelevent had dislocated his kneepan in his fall. Father Madeleine\nhad him conveyed to an infirmary which he had established for his\nworkmen in the factory building itself, and which was served by two\nsisters of charity. On the following morning the old man found a\nthousand-franc bank-note on his night-stand, with these words in Father\nMadeleine’s writing: _“I purchase your horse and cart.”_ The cart was\nbroken, and the horse was dead. Fauchelevent recovered, but his knee\nremained stiff. M. Madeleine, on the recommendation of the sisters of\ncharity and of his priest, got the good man a place as gardener in a\nfemale convent in the Rue Saint-Antoine in Paris.\n\nSome time afterwards, M. Madeleine was appointed mayor. The first time\nthat Javert beheld M. Madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave him\nauthority over the town, he felt the sort of shudder which a watch-dog\nmight experience on smelling a wolf in his master’s clothes. From that\ntime forth he avoided him as much as he possibly could. When the\nrequirements of the service imperatively demanded it, and he could not\ndo otherwise than meet the mayor, he addressed him with profound\nrespect.\n\nThis prosperity created at M. sur M. by Father Madeleine had, besides\nthe visible signs which we have mentioned, another symptom which was\nnonetheless significant for not being visible. This never deceives.\nWhen the population suffers, when work is lacking, when there is no\ncommerce, the tax-payer resists imposts through penury, he exhausts and\noversteps his respite, and the state expends a great deal of money in\nthe charges for compelling and collection. When work is abundant, when\nthe country is rich and happy, the taxes are paid easily and cost the\nstate nothing. It may be said, that there is one infallible thermometer\nof the public misery and riches,—the cost of collecting the taxes. In\nthe course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes had\ndiminished three-fourths in the arrondissement of M. sur M., and this\nled to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest by\nM. de Villèle, then Minister of Finance.\n\nSuch was the condition of the country when Fantine returned thither. No\none remembered her. Fortunately, the door of M. Madeleine’s factory was\nlike the face of a friend. She presented herself there, and was\nadmitted to the women’s workroom. The trade was entirely new to\nFantine; she could not be very skilful at it, and she therefore earned\nbut little by her day’s work; but it was sufficient; the problem was\nsolved; she was earning her living.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—MADAME VICTURNIEN EXPENDS THIRTY FRANCS ON MORALITY\n\n\nWhen Fantine saw that she was making her living, she felt joyful for a\nmoment. To live honestly by her own labor, what mercy from heaven! The\ntaste for work had really returned to her. She bought a looking-glass,\ntook pleasure in surveying in it her youth, her beautiful hair, her\nfine teeth; she forgot many things; she thought only of Cosette and of\nthe possible future, and was almost happy. She hired a little room and\nfurnished on credit on the strength of her future work—a lingering\ntrace of her improvident ways. As she was not able to say that she was\nmarried she took good care, as we have seen, not to mention her little\ngirl.\n\nAt first, as the reader has seen, she paid the Thénardiers promptly. As\nshe only knew how to sign her name, she was obliged to write through a\npublic letter-writer.\n\nShe wrote often, and this was noticed. It began to be said in an\nundertone, in the women’s workroom, that Fantine “wrote letters” and\nthat “she had ways about her.”\n\n\nThere is no one for spying on people’s actions like those who are not\nconcerned in them. Why does that gentleman never come except at\nnightfall? Why does Mr. So-and-So never hang his key on its nail on\nTuesday? Why does he always take the narrow streets? Why does Madame\nalways descend from her hackney-coach before reaching her house? Why\ndoes she send out to purchase six sheets of note paper, when she has a\n“whole stationer’s shop full of it?” etc. There exist beings who, for\nthe sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas, which are, moreover, of\nno consequence whatever to them, spend more money, waste more time,\ntake more trouble, than would be required for ten good actions, and\nthat gratuitously, for their own pleasure, without receiving any other\npayment for their curiosity than curiosity. They will follow up such\nand such a man or woman for whole days; they will do sentry duty for\nhours at a time on the corners of the streets, under alley-way doors at\nnight, in cold and rain; they will bribe errand-porters, they will make\nthe drivers of hackney-coaches and lackeys tipsy, buy a waiting-maid,\nsuborn a porter. Why? For no reason. A pure passion for seeing,\nknowing, and penetrating into things. A pure itch for talking. And\noften these secrets once known, these mysteries made public, these\nenigmas illuminated by the light of day, bring on catastrophies, duels,\nfailures, the ruin of families, and broken lives, to the great joy of\nthose who have “found out everything,” without any interest in the\nmatter, and by pure instinct. A sad thing.\n\nCertain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking.\nTheir conversation, the chat of the drawing-room, gossip of the\nanteroom, is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly; they need\na great amount of combustibles; and their combustibles are furnished by\ntheir neighbors.\n\nSo Fantine was watched.\n\nIn addition, many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her white\nteeth.\n\nIt was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside, in the\nmidst of the rest, to wipe away a tear. These were the moments when she\nwas thinking of her child; perhaps, also, of the man whom she had\nloved.\n\nBreaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task.\n\nIt was observed that she wrote twice a month at least, and that she\npaid the carriage on the letter. They managed to obtain the address:\n_Monsieur, Monsieur Thénardier, inn-keeper at Montfermeil_. The public\nwriter, a good old man who could not fill his stomach with red wine\nwithout emptying his pocket of secrets, was made to talk in the\nwine-shop. In short, it was discovered that Fantine had a child. “She\nmust be a pretty sort of a woman.” An old gossip was found, who made\nthe trip to Montfermeil, talked to the Thénardiers, and said on her\nreturn: “For my five and thirty francs I have freed my mind. I have\nseen the child.”\n\n\nThe gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien, the\nguardian and door-keeper of every one’s virtue. Madame Victurnien was\nfifty-six, and re-enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age. A\nquavering voice, a whimsical mind. This old dame had once been\nyoung—astonishing fact! In her youth, in ’93, she had married a monk\nwho had fled from his cloister in a red cap, and passed from the\nBernardines to the Jacobins. She was dry, rough, peevish, sharp,\ncaptious, almost venomous; all this in memory of her monk, whose widow\nshe was, and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his\nwill. She was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible.\nAt the Restoration she had turned bigot, and that with so much energy\nthat the priests had forgiven her her monk. She had a small property,\nwhich she bequeathed with much ostentation to a religious community.\nShe was in high favor at the episcopal palace of Arras. So this Madame\nVicturnien went to Montfermeil, and returned with the remark, “I have\nseen the child.”\n\n\nAll this took time. Fantine had been at the factory for more than a\nyear, when, one morning, the superintendent of the workroom handed her\nfifty francs from the mayor, told her that she was no longer employed\nin the shop, and requested her, in the mayor’s name, to leave the\nneighborhood.\n\nThis was the very month when the Thénardiers, after having demanded\ntwelve francs instead of six, had just exacted fifteen francs instead\nof twelve.\n\nFantine was overwhelmed. She could not leave the neighborhood; she was\nin debt for her rent and furniture. Fifty francs was not sufficient to\ncancel this debt. She stammered a few supplicating words. The\nsuperintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant. Besides,\nFantine was only a moderately good workwoman. Overcome with shame, even\nmore than with despair, she quitted the shop, and returned to her room.\nSo her fault was now known to every one.\n\nShe no longer felt strong enough to say a word. She was advised to see\nthe mayor; she did not dare. The mayor had given her fifty francs\nbecause he was good, and had dismissed her because he was just. She\nbowed before the decision.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—MADAME VICTURNIEN’S SUCCESS\n\n\nSo the monk’s widow was good for something.\n\nBut M. Madeleine had heard nothing of all this. Life is full of just\nsuch combinations of events. M. Madeleine was in the habit of almost\nnever entering the women’s workroom.\n\nAt the head of this room he had placed an elderly spinster, whom the\npriest had provided for him, and he had full confidence in this\nsuperintendent,—a truly respectable person, firm, equitable, upright,\nfull of the charity which consists in giving, but not having in the\nsame degree that charity which consists in understanding and in\nforgiving. M. Madeleine relied wholly on her. The best men are often\nobliged to delegate their authority. It was with this full power, and\nthe conviction that she was doing right, that the superintendent had\ninstituted the suit, judged, condemned, and executed Fantine.\n\nAs regards the fifty francs, she had given them from a fund which M.\nMadeleine had intrusted to her for charitable purposes, and for giving\nassistance to the workwomen, and of which she rendered no account.\n\nFantine tried to obtain a situation as a servant in the neighborhood;\nshe went from house to house. No one would have her. She could not\nleave town. The second-hand dealer, to whom she was in debt for her\nfurniture—and what furniture!—said to her, “If you leave, I will have\nyou arrested as a thief.” The householder, whom she owed for her rent,\nsaid to her, “You are young and pretty; you can pay.” She divided the\nfifty francs between the landlord and the furniture-dealer, returned to\nthe latter three-quarters of his goods, kept only necessaries, and\nfound herself without work, without a trade, with nothing but her bed,\nand still about fifty francs in debt.\n\nShe began to make coarse shirts for soldiers of the garrison, and\nearned twelve sous a day. Her daughter cost her ten. It was at this\npoint that she began to pay the Thénardiers irregularly.\n\nHowever, the old woman who lighted her candle for her when she returned\nat night, taught her the art of living in misery. Back of living on\nlittle, there is the living on nothing. These are the two chambers; the\nfirst is dark, the second is black.\n\nFantine learned how to live without fire entirely in the winter; how to\ngive up a bird which eats a half a farthing’s worth of millet every two\ndays; how to make a coverlet of one’s petticoat, and a petticoat of\none’s coverlet; how to save one’s candle, by taking one’s meals by the\nlight of the opposite window. No one knows all that certain feeble\ncreatures, who have grown old in privation and honesty, can get out of\na sou. It ends by being a talent. Fantine acquired this sublime talent,\nand regained a little courage.\n\nAt this epoch she said to a neighbor, “Bah! I say to myself, by only\nsleeping five hours, and working all the rest of the time at my sewing,\nI shall always manage to nearly earn my bread. And, then, when one is\nsad, one eats less. Well, sufferings, uneasiness, a little bread on one\nhand, trouble on the other,—all this will support me.”\n\n\nIt would have been a great happiness to have her little girl with her\nin this distress. She thought of having her come. But what then! Make\nher share her own destitution! And then, she was in debt to the\nThénardiers! How could she pay them? And the journey! How pay for that?\n\nThe old woman who had given her lessons in what may be called the life\nof indigence, was a sainted spinster named Marguerite, who was pious\nwith a true piety, poor and charitable towards the poor, and even\ntowards the rich, knowing how to write just sufficiently to sign\nherself Marguerite, and believing in God, which is science.\n\nThere are many such virtuous people in this lower world; some day they\nwill be in the world above. This life has a morrow.\n\nAt first, Fantine had been so ashamed that she had not dared to go out.\n\nWhen she was in the street, she divined that people turned round behind\nher, and pointed at her; every one stared at her and no one greeted\nher; the cold and bitter scorn of the passers-by penetrated her very\nflesh and soul like a north wind.\n\nIt seems as though an unfortunate woman were utterly bare beneath the\nsarcasm and the curiosity of all in small towns. In Paris, at least, no\none knows you, and this obscurity is a garment. Oh! how she would have\nliked to betake herself to Paris! Impossible!\n\nShe was obliged to accustom herself to disrepute, as she had accustomed\nherself to indigence. Gradually she decided on her course. At the\nexpiration of two or three months she shook off her shame, and began to\ngo about as though there were nothing the matter. “It is all the same\nto me,” she said.\n\nShe went and came, bearing her head well up, with a bitter smile, and\nwas conscious that she was becoming brazen-faced.\n\nMadame Victurnien sometimes saw her passing, from her window, noticed\nthe distress of “that creature” who, “thanks to her,” had been “put\nback in her proper place,” and congratulated herself. The happiness of\nthe evil-minded is black.\n\nExcess of toil wore out Fantine, and the little dry cough which\ntroubled her increased. She sometimes said to her neighbor, Marguerite,\n“Just feel how hot my hands are!”\n\n\nNevertheless, when she combed her beautiful hair in the morning with an\nold broken comb, and it flowed about her like floss silk, she\nexperienced a moment of happy coquetry.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X—RESULT OF THE SUCCESS\n\n\nShe had been dismissed towards the end of the winter; the summer\npassed, but winter came again. Short days, less work. Winter: no\nwarmth, no light, no noonday, the evening joining on to the morning,\nfogs, twilight; the window is gray; it is impossible to see clearly at\nit. The sky is but a vent-hole. The whole day is a cavern. The sun has\nthe air of a beggar. A frightful season! Winter changes the water of\nheaven and the heart of man into a stone. Her creditors harrassed her.\n\nFantine earned too little. Her debts had increased. The Thénardiers,\nwho were not promptly paid, wrote to her constantly letters whose\ncontents drove her to despair, and whose carriage ruined her. One day\nthey wrote to her that her little Cosette was entirely naked in that\ncold weather, that she needed a woollen skirt, and that her mother must\nsend at least ten francs for this. She received the letter, and crushed\nit in her hands all day long. That evening she went into a barber’s\nshop at the corner of the street, and pulled out her comb. Her\nadmirable golden hair fell to her knees.\n\n“What splendid hair!” exclaimed the barber.\n\n“How much will you give me for it?” said she.\n\n“Ten francs.”\n\n\n“Cut it off.”\n\n\nShe purchased a knitted petticoat and sent it to the Thénardiers. This\npetticoat made the Thénardiers furious. It was the money that they\nwanted. They gave the petticoat to Éponine. The poor Lark continued to\nshiver.\n\nFantine thought: “My child is no longer cold. I have clothed her with\nmy hair.” She put on little round caps which concealed her shorn head,\nand in which she was still pretty.\n\nDark thoughts held possession of Fantine’s heart.\n\nWhen she saw that she could no longer dress her hair, she began to hate\nevery one about her. She had long shared the universal veneration for\nFather Madeleine; yet, by dint of repeating to herself that it was he\nwho had discharged her, that he was the cause of her unhappiness, she\ncame to hate him also, and most of all. When she passed the factory in\nworking hours, when the workpeople were at the door, she affected to\nlaugh and sing.\n\nAn old workwoman who once saw her laughing and singing in this fashion\nsaid, “There’s a girl who will come to a bad end.”\n\n\nShe took a lover, the first who offered, a man whom she did not love,\nout of bravado and with rage in her heart. He was a miserable scamp, a\nsort of mendicant musician, a lazy beggar, who beat her, and who\nabandoned her as she had taken him, in disgust.\n\nShe adored her child.\n\nThe lower she descended, the darker everything grew about her, the more\nradiant shone that little angel at the bottom of her heart. She said,\n“When I get rich, I will have my Cosette with me;” and she laughed. Her\ncough did not leave her, and she had sweats on her back.\n\nOne day she received from the Thénardiers a letter couched in the\nfollowing terms: “Cosette is ill with a malady which is going the\nrounds of the neighborhood. A miliary fever, they call it. Expensive\ndrugs are required. This is ruining us, and we can no longer pay for\nthem. If you do not send us forty francs before the week is out, the\nlittle one will be dead.”\n\n\nShe burst out laughing, and said to her old neighbor: “Ah! they are\ngood! Forty francs! the idea! That makes two napoleons! Where do they\nthink I am to get them? These peasants are stupid, truly.”\n\n\nNevertheless she went to a dormer window in the staircase and read the\nletter once more. Then she descended the stairs and emerged, running\nand leaping and still laughing.\n\nSome one met her and said to her, “What makes you so gay?”\n\n\nShe replied: “A fine piece of stupidity that some country people have\nwritten to me. They demand forty francs of me. So much for you, you\npeasants!”\n\n\nAs she crossed the square, she saw a great many people collected around\na carriage of eccentric shape, upon the top of which stood a man\ndressed in red, who was holding forth. He was a quack dentist on his\nrounds, who was offering to the public full sets of teeth, opiates,\npowders and elixirs.\n\nFantine mingled in the group, and began to laugh with the rest at the\nharangue, which contained slang for the populace and jargon for\nrespectable people. The tooth-puller espied the lovely, laughing girl,\nand suddenly exclaimed: “You have beautiful teeth, you girl there, who\nare laughing; if you want to sell me your palettes, I will give you a\ngold napoleon apiece for them.”\n\n\n“What are my palettes?” asked Fantine.\n\n“The palettes,” replied the dental professor, “are the front teeth, the\ntwo upper ones.”\n\n\n“How horrible!” exclaimed Fantine.\n\n“Two napoleons!” grumbled a toothless old woman who was present.\n“Here’s a lucky girl!”\n\n\nFantine fled and stopped her ears that she might not hear the hoarse\nvoice of the man shouting to her: “Reflect, my beauty! two napoleons;\nthey may prove of service. If your heart bids you, come this evening to\nthe inn of the _Tillac d’Argent_; you will find me there.”\n\n\nFantine returned home. She was furious, and related the occurrence to\nher good neighbor Marguerite: “Can you understand such a thing? Is he\nnot an abominable man? How can they allow such people to go about the\ncountry! Pull out my two front teeth! Why, I should be horrible! My\nhair will grow again, but my teeth! Ah! what a monster of a man! I\nshould prefer to throw myself head first on the pavement from the fifth\nstory! He told me that he should be at the _Tillac d’Argent_ this\nevening.”\n\n\n“And what did he offer?” asked Marguerite.\n\n“Two napoleons.”\n\n\n“That makes forty francs.”\n\n\n“Yes,” said Fantine; “that makes forty francs.”\n\n\nShe remained thoughtful, and began her work. At the expiration of a\nquarter of an hour she left her sewing and went to read the\nThénardiers’ letter once more on the staircase.\n\nOn her return, she said to Marguerite, who was at work beside her:—\n\n“What is a miliary fever? Do you know?”\n\n\n“Yes,” answered the old spinster; “it is a disease.”\n\n\n“Does it require many drugs?”\n\n\n“Oh! terrible drugs.”\n\n\n“How does one get it?”\n\n\n“It is a malady that one gets without knowing how.”\n\n\n“Then it attacks children?”\n\n\n“Children in particular.”\n\n\n“Do people die of it?”\n\n\n“They may,” said Marguerite.\n\nFantine left the room and went to read her letter once more on the\nstaircase.\n\nThat evening she went out, and was seen to turn her steps in the\ndirection of the Rue de Paris, where the inns are situated.\n\nThe next morning, when Marguerite entered Fantine’s room before\ndaylight,—for they always worked together, and in this manner used only\none candle for the two,—she found Fantine seated on her bed, pale and\nfrozen. She had not lain down. Her cap had fallen on her knees. Her\ncandle had burned all night, and was almost entirely consumed.\nMarguerite halted on the threshold, petrified at this tremendous\nwastefulness, and exclaimed:—\n\n“Lord! the candle is all burned out! Something has happened.”\n\n\nThen she looked at Fantine, who turned toward her her head bereft of\nits hair.\n\nFantine had grown ten years older since the preceding night.\n\n“Jesus!” said Marguerite, “what is the matter with you, Fantine?”\n\n\n“Nothing,” replied Fantine. “Quite the contrary. My child will not die\nof that frightful malady, for lack of succor. I am content.”\n\n\nSo saying, she pointed out to the spinster two napoleons which were\nglittering on the table.\n\n“Ah! Jesus God!” cried Marguerite. “Why, it is a fortune! Where did you\nget those louis d’or?”\n\n\n“I got them,” replied Fantine.\n\nAt the same time she smiled. The candle illuminated her countenance. It\nwas a bloody smile. A reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips,\nand she had a black hole in her mouth.\n\nThe two teeth had been extracted.\n\nShe sent the forty francs to Montfermeil.\n\nAfter all it was a ruse of the Thénardiers to obtain money. Cosette was\nnot ill.\n\nFantine threw her mirror out of the window. She had long since quitted\nher cell on the second floor for an attic with only a latch to fasten\nit, next the roof; one of those attics whose extremity forms an angle\nwith the floor, and knocks you on the head every instant. The poor\noccupant can reach the end of his chamber as he can the end of his\ndestiny, only by bending over more and more.\n\nShe had no longer a bed; a rag which she called her coverlet, a\nmattress on the floor, and a seatless chair still remained. A little\nrosebush which she had, had dried up, forgotten, in one corner. In the\nother corner was a butter-pot to hold water, which froze in winter, and\nin which the various levels of the water remained long marked by these\ncircles of ice. She had lost her shame; she lost her coquetry. A final\nsign. She went out, with dirty caps. Whether from lack of time or from\nindifference, she no longer mended her linen. As the heels wore out,\nshe dragged her stockings down into her shoes. This was evident from\nthe perpendicular wrinkles. She patched her bodice, which was old and\nworn out, with scraps of calico which tore at the slightest movement.\nThe people to whom she was indebted made “scenes” and gave her no\npeace. She found them in the street, she found them again on her\nstaircase. She passed many a night weeping and thinking. Her eyes were\nvery bright, and she felt a steady pain in her shoulder towards the top\nof the left shoulder-blade. She coughed a great deal. She deeply hated\nFather Madeleine, but made no complaint. She sewed seventeen hours a\nday; but a contractor for the work of prisons, who made the prisoners\nwork at a discount, suddenly made prices fall, which reduced the daily\nearnings of working-women to nine sous. Seventeen hours of toil, and\nnine sous a day! Her creditors were more pitiless than ever. The\nsecond-hand dealer, who had taken back nearly all his furniture, said\nto her incessantly, “When will you pay me, you hussy?” What did they\nwant of her, good God! She felt that she was being hunted, and\nsomething of the wild beast developed in her. About the same time,\nThénardier wrote to her that he had waited with decidedly too much\namiability and that he must have a hundred francs at once; otherwise he\nwould turn little Cosette out of doors, convalescent as she was from\nher heavy illness, into the cold and the streets, and that she might do\nwhat she liked with herself, and die if she chose. “A hundred francs,”\nthought Fantine. “But in what trade can one earn a hundred sous a day?”\n\n\n“Come!” said she, “let us sell what is left.”\n\n\nThe unfortunate girl became a woman of the town.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI—CHRISTUS NOS LIBERAVIT\n\n\nWhat is this history of Fantine? It is society purchasing a slave.\n\nFrom whom? From misery.\n\nFrom hunger, cold, isolation, destitution. A dolorous bargain. A soul\nfor a morsel of bread. Misery offers; society accepts.\n\nThe sacred law of Jesus Christ governs our civilization, but it does\nnot, as yet, permeate it; it is said that slavery has disappeared from\nEuropean civilization. This is a mistake. It still exists; but it\nweighs only upon the woman, and it is called prostitution.\n\nIt weighs upon the woman, that is to say, upon grace, weakness, beauty,\nmaternity. This is not one of the least of man’s disgraces.\n\nAt the point in this melancholy drama which we have now reached,\nnothing is left to Fantine of that which she had formerly been.\n\nShe has become marble in becoming mire. Whoever touches her feels cold.\nShe passes; she endures you; she ignores you; she is the severe and\ndishonored figure. Life and the social order have said their last word\nfor her. All has happened to her that will happen to her. She has felt\neverything, borne everything, experienced everything, suffered\neverything, lost everything, mourned everything. She is resigned, with\nthat resignation which resembles indifference, as death resembles\nsleep. She no longer avoids anything. Let all the clouds fall upon her,\nand all the ocean sweep over her! What matters it to her? She is a\nsponge that is soaked.\n\nAt least, she believes it to be so; but it is an error to imagine that\nfate can be exhausted, and that one has reached the bottom of anything\nwhatever.\n\nAlas! What are all these fates, driven on pell-mell? Whither are they\ngoing? Why are they thus?\n\nHe who knows that sees the whole of the shadow.\n\nHe is alone. His name is God.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII—M. BAMATABOIS’S INACTIVITY\n\n\nThere is in all small towns, and there was at M. sur M. in particular,\na class of young men who nibble away an income of fifteen hundred\nfrancs with the same air with which their prototypes devour two hundred\nthousand francs a year in Paris. These are beings of the great neuter\nspecies: impotent men, parasites, cyphers, who have a little land, a\nlittle folly, a little wit; who would be rustics in a drawing-room, and\nwho think themselves gentlemen in the dram-shop; who say, “My fields,\nmy peasants, my woods”; who hiss actresses at the theatre to prove that\nthey are persons of taste; quarrel with the officers of the garrison to\nprove that they are men of war; hunt, smoke, yawn, drink, smell of\ntobacco, play billiards, stare at travellers as they descend from the\ndiligence, live at the café, dine at the inn, have a dog which eats the\nbones under the table, and a mistress who eats the dishes on the table;\nwho stick at a sou, exaggerate the fashions, admire tragedy, despise\nwomen, wear out their old boots, copy London through Paris, and Paris\nthrough the medium of Pont-à-Mousson, grow old as dullards, never work,\nserve no use, and do no great harm.\n\nM. Félix Tholomyès, had he remained in his own province and never\nbeheld Paris, would have been one of these men.\n\nIf they were richer, one would say, “They are dandies;” if they were\npoorer, one would say, “They are idlers.” They are simply men without\nemployment. Among these unemployed there are bores, the bored,\ndreamers, and some knaves.\n\nAt that period a dandy was composed of a tall collar, a big cravat, a\nwatch with trinkets, three vests of different colors, worn one on top\nof the other—the red and blue inside; of a short-waisted olive coat,\nwith a codfish tail, a double row of silver buttons set close to each\nother and running up to the shoulder; and a pair of trousers of a\nlighter shade of olive, ornamented on the two seams with an indefinite,\nbut always uneven, number of lines, varying from one to eleven—a limit\nwhich was never exceeded. Add to this, high shoes with little irons on\nthe heels, a tall hat with a narrow brim, hair worn in a tuft, an\nenormous cane, and conversation set off by puns of Potier. Over all,\nspurs and a moustache. At that epoch moustaches indicated the\nbourgeois, and spurs the pedestrian.\n\nThe provincial dandy wore the longest of spurs and the fiercest of\nmoustaches.\n\nIt was the period of the conflict of the republics of South America\nwith the King of Spain, of Bolivar against Morillo. Narrow-brimmed hats\nwere royalist, and were called _morillos_; liberals wore hats with wide\nbrims, which were called _bolivars_.\n\nEight or ten months, then, after that which is related in the preceding\npages, towards the first of January, 1823, on a snowy evening, one of\nthese dandies, one of these unemployed, a “right thinker,” for he wore\na morillo, and was, moreover, warmly enveloped in one of those large\ncloaks which completed the fashionable costume in cold weather, was\namusing himself by tormenting a creature who was prowling about in a\nball-dress, with neck uncovered and flowers in her hair, in front of\nthe officers’ café. This dandy was smoking, for he was decidedly\nfashionable.\n\nEach time that the woman passed in front of him, he bestowed on her,\ntogether with a puff from his cigar, some apostrophe which he\nconsidered witty and mirthful, such as, “How ugly you are!—Will you get\nout of my sight?—You have no teeth!” etc., etc. This gentleman was\nknown as M. Bamatabois. The woman, a melancholy, decorated spectre\nwhich went and came through the snow, made him no reply, did not even\nglance at him, and nevertheless continued her promenade in silence, and\nwith a sombre regularity, which brought her every five minutes within\nreach of this sarcasm, like the condemned soldier who returns under the\nrods. The small effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger;\nand taking advantage of a moment when her back was turned, he crept up\nbehind her with the gait of a wolf, and stifling his laugh, bent down,\npicked up a handful of snow from the pavement, and thrust it abruptly\ninto her back, between her bare shoulders. The woman uttered a roar,\nwhirled round, gave a leap like a panther, and hurled herself upon the\nman, burying her nails in his face, with the most frightful words which\ncould fall from the guard-room into the gutter. These insults, poured\nforth in a voice roughened by brandy, did, indeed, proceed in hideous\nwise from a mouth which lacked its two front teeth. It was Fantine.\n\nAt the noise thus produced, the officers ran out in throngs from the\ncafé, passers-by collected, and a large and merry circle, hooting and\napplauding, was formed around this whirlwind composed of two beings,\nwhom there was some difficulty in recognizing as a man and a woman: the\nman struggling, his hat on the ground; the woman striking out with feet\nand fists, bareheaded, howling, minus hair and teeth, livid with wrath,\nhorrible.\n\nSuddenly a man of lofty stature emerged vivaciously from the crowd,\nseized the woman by her satin bodice, which was covered with mud, and\nsaid to her, “Follow me!”\n\n\nThe woman raised her head; her furious voice suddenly died away. Her\neyes were glassy; she turned pale instead of livid, and she trembled\nwith a quiver of terror. She had recognized Javert.\n\nThe dandy took advantage of the incident to make his escape.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII—THE SOLUTION OF SOME QUESTIONS CONNECTED WITH THE\nMUNICIPAL POLICE\n\n\nJavert thrust aside the spectators, broke the circle, and set out with\nlong strides towards the police station, which is situated at the\nextremity of the square, dragging the wretched woman after him. She\nyielded mechanically. Neither he nor she uttered a word. The cloud of\nspectators followed, jesting, in a paroxysm of delight. Supreme misery\nan occasion for obscenity.\n\nOn arriving at the police station, which was a low room, warmed by a\nstove, with a glazed and grated door opening on the street, and guarded\nby a detachment, Javert opened the door, entered with Fantine, and shut\nthe door behind him, to the great disappointment of the curious, who\nraised themselves on tiptoe, and craned their necks in front of the\nthick glass of the station-house, in their effort to see. Curiosity is\na sort of gluttony. To see is to devour.\n\nOn entering, Fantine fell down in a corner, motionless and mute,\ncrouching down like a terrified dog.\n\nThe sergeant of the guard brought a lighted candle to the table. Javert\nseated himself, drew a sheet of stamped paper from his pocket, and\nbegan to write.\n\nThis class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretion\nof the police. The latter do what they please, punish them, as seems\ngood to them, and confiscate at their will those two sorry things which\nthey entitle their industry and their liberty. Javert was impassive;\nhis grave face betrayed no emotion whatever. Nevertheless, he was\nseriously and deeply preoccupied. It was one of those moments when he\nwas exercising without control, but subject to all the scruples of a\nsevere conscience, his redoubtable discretionary power. At that moment\nhe was conscious that his police agent’s stool was a tribunal. He was\nentering judgment. He judged and condemned. He summoned all the ideas\nwhich could possibly exist in his mind, around the great thing which he\nwas doing. The more he examined the deed of this woman, the more\nshocked he felt. It was evident that he had just witnessed the\ncommission of a crime. He had just beheld, yonder, in the street,\nsociety, in the person of a freeholder and an elector, insulted and\nattacked by a creature who was outside all pales. A prostitute had made\nan attempt on the life of a citizen. He had seen that, he, Javert. He\nwrote in silence.\n\nWhen he had finished he signed the paper, folded it, and said to the\nsergeant of the guard, as he handed it to him, “Take three men and\nconduct this creature to jail.”\n\n\nThen, turning to Fantine, “You are to have six months of it.” The\nunhappy woman shuddered.\n\n“Six months! six months of prison!” she exclaimed. “Six months in which\nto earn seven sous a day! But what will become of Cosette? My daughter!\nmy daughter! But I still owe the Thénardiers over a hundred francs; do\nyou know that, Monsieur Inspector?”\n\n\nShe dragged herself across the damp floor, among the muddy boots of all\nthose men, without rising, with clasped hands, and taking great strides\non her knees.\n\n“Monsieur Javert,” said she, “I beseech your mercy. I assure you that I\nwas not in the wrong. If you had seen the beginning, you would have\nseen. I swear to you by the good God that I was not to blame! That\ngentleman, the bourgeois, whom I do not know, put snow in my back. Has\nany one the right to put snow down our backs when we are walking along\npeaceably, and doing no harm to any one? I am rather ill, as you see.\nAnd then, he had been saying impertinent things to me for a long time:\n‘You are ugly! you have no teeth!’ I know well that I have no longer\nthose teeth. I did nothing; I said to myself, ‘The gentleman is amusing\nhimself.’ I was honest with him; I did not speak to him. It was at that\nmoment that he put the snow down my back. Monsieur Javert, good\nMonsieur Inspector! is there not some person here who saw it and can\ntell you that this is quite true? Perhaps I did wrong to get angry. You\nknow that one is not master of one’s self at the first moment. One\ngives way to vivacity; and then, when some one puts something cold down\nyour back just when you are not expecting it! I did wrong to spoil that\ngentleman’s hat. Why did he go away? I would ask his pardon. Oh, my\nGod! It makes no difference to me whether I ask his pardon. Do me the\nfavor to-day, for this once, Monsieur Javert. Hold! you do not know\nthat in prison one can earn only seven sous a day; it is not the\ngovernment’s fault, but seven sous is one’s earnings; and just fancy, I\nmust pay one hundred francs, or my little girl will be sent to me. Oh,\nmy God! I cannot have her with me. What I do is so vile! Oh, my\nCosette! Oh, my little angel of the Holy Virgin! what will become of\nher, poor creature? I will tell you: it is the Thénardiers,\ninn-keepers, peasants; and such people are unreasonable. They want\nmoney. Don’t put me in prison! You see, there is a little girl who will\nbe turned out into the street to get along as best she may, in the very\nheart of the winter; and you must have pity on such a being, my good\nMonsieur Javert. If she were older, she might earn her living; but it\ncannot be done at that age. I am not a bad woman at bottom. It is not\ncowardliness and gluttony that have made me what I am. If I have drunk\nbrandy, it was out of misery. I do not love it; but it benumbs the\nsenses. When I was happy, it was only necessary to glance into my\nclosets, and it would have been evident that I was not a coquettish and\nuntidy woman. I had linen, a great deal of linen. Have pity on me,\nMonsieur Javert!”\n\n\nShe spoke thus, rent in twain, shaken with sobs, blinded with tears,\nher neck bare, wringing her hands, and coughing with a dry, short\ncough, stammering softly with a voice of agony. Great sorrow is a\ndivine and terrible ray, which transfigures the unhappy. At that moment\nFantine had become beautiful once more. From time to time she paused,\nand tenderly kissed the police agent’s coat. She would have softened a\nheart of granite; but a heart of wood cannot be softened.\n\n“Come!” said Javert, “I have heard you out. Have you entirely finished?\nYou will get six months. Now march! The Eternal Father in person could\ndo nothing more.”\n\n\nAt these solemn words, _“the Eternal Father in person could do nothing\nmore,”_ she understood that her fate was sealed. She sank down,\nmurmuring, “Mercy!”\n\n\nJavert turned his back.\n\nThe soldiers seized her by the arms.\n\nA few moments earlier a man had entered, but no one had paid any heed\nto him. He shut the door, leaned his back against it, and listened to\nFantine’s despairing supplications.\n\nAt the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the unfortunate\nwoman, who would not rise, he emerged from the shadow, and said:—\n\n“One moment, if you please.”\n\n\nJavert raised his eyes and recognized M. Madeleine. He removed his hat,\nand, saluting him with a sort of aggrieved awkwardness:—\n\n“Excuse me, Mr. Mayor—”\n\n\nThe words “Mr. Mayor” produced a curious effect upon Fantine. She rose\nto her feet with one bound, like a spectre springing from the earth,\nthrust aside the soldiers with both arms, walked straight up to M.\nMadeleine before any one could prevent her, and gazing intently at him,\nwith a bewildered air, she cried:—\n\n“Ah! so it is you who are M. le Maire!”\n\n\nThen she burst into a laugh, and spit in his face.\n\nM. Madeleine wiped his face, and said:—\n\n“Inspector Javert, set this woman at liberty.”\n\n\nJavert felt that he was on the verge of going mad. He experienced at\nthat moment, blow upon blow and almost simultaneously, the most violent\nemotions which he had ever undergone in all his life. To see a woman of\nthe town spit in the mayor’s face was a thing so monstrous that, in his\nmost daring flights of fancy, he would have regarded it as a sacrilege\nto believe it possible. On the other hand, at the very bottom of his\nthought, he made a hideous comparison as to what this woman was, and as\nto what this mayor might be; and then he, with horror, caught a glimpse\nof I know not what simple explanation of this prodigious attack. But\nwhen he beheld that mayor, that magistrate, calmly wipe his face and\nsay, _“Set this woman at liberty,”_ he underwent a sort of intoxication\nof amazement; thought and word failed him equally; the sum total of\npossible astonishment had been exceeded in his case. He remained mute.\n\nThe words had produced no less strange an effect on Fantine. She raised\nher bare arm, and clung to the damper of the stove, like a person who\nis reeling. Nevertheless, she glanced about her, and began to speak in\na low voice, as though talking to herself:—\n\n“At liberty! I am to be allowed to go! I am not to go to prison for six\nmonths! Who said that? It is not possible that any one could have said\nthat. I did not hear aright. It cannot have been that monster of a\nmayor! Was it you, my good Monsieur Javert, who said that I was to be\nset free? Oh, see here! I will tell you about it, and you will let me\ngo. That monster of a mayor, that old blackguard of a mayor, is the\ncause of all. Just imagine, Monsieur Javert, he turned me out! all\nbecause of a pack of rascally women, who gossip in the workroom. If\nthat is not a horror, what is? To dismiss a poor girl who is doing her\nwork honestly! Then I could no longer earn enough, and all this misery\nfollowed. In the first place, there is one improvement which these\ngentlemen of the police ought to make, and that is, to prevent prison\ncontractors from wronging poor people. I will explain it to you, you\nsee: you are earning twelve sous at shirt-making, the price falls to\nnine sous; and it is not enough to live on. Then one has to become\nwhatever one can. As for me, I had my little Cosette, and I was\nactually forced to become a bad woman. Now you understand how it is\nthat that blackguard of a mayor caused all the mischief. After that I\nstamped on that gentleman’s hat in front of the officers’ café; but he\nhad spoiled my whole dress with snow. We women have but one silk dress\nfor evening wear. You see that I did not do wrong deliberately—truly,\nMonsieur Javert; and everywhere I behold women who are far more wicked\nthan I, and who are much happier. O Monsieur Javert! it was you who\ngave orders that I am to be set free, was it not? Make inquiries, speak\nto my landlord; I am paying my rent now; they will tell you that I am\nperfectly honest. Ah! my God! I beg your pardon; I have unintentionally\ntouched the damper of the stove, and it has made it smoke.”\n\n\nM. Madeleine listened to her with profound attention. While she was\nspeaking, he fumbled in his waistcoat, drew out his purse and opened\nit. It was empty. He put it back in his pocket. He said to Fantine,\n“How much did you say that you owed?”\n\n\nFantine, who was looking at Javert only, turned towards him:—\n\n“Was I speaking to you?”\n\n\nThen, addressing the soldiers:—\n\n“Say, you fellows, did you see how I spit in his face? Ah! you old\nwretch of a mayor, you came here to frighten me, but I’m not afraid of\nyou. I am afraid of Monsieur Javert. I am afraid of my good Monsieur\nJavert!”\n\n\nSo saying, she turned to the inspector again:—\n\n“And yet, you see, Mr. Inspector, it is necessary to be just. I\nunderstand that you are just, Mr. Inspector; in fact, it is perfectly\nsimple: a man amuses himself by putting snow down a woman’s back, and\nthat makes the officers laugh; one must divert themselves in some way;\nand we—well, we are here for them to amuse themselves with, of course!\nAnd then, you, you come; you are certainly obliged to preserve order,\nyou lead off the woman who is in the wrong; but on reflection, since\nyou are a good man, you say that I am to be set at liberty; it is for\nthe sake of the little one, for six months in prison would prevent my\nsupporting my child. ‘Only, don’t do it again, you hussy!’ Oh! I won’t\ndo it again, Monsieur Javert! They may do whatever they please to me\nnow; I will not stir. But to-day, you see, I cried because it hurt me.\nI was not expecting that snow from the gentleman at all; and then as I\ntold you, I am not well; I have a cough; I seem to have a burning ball\nin my stomach, and the doctor tells me, ‘Take care of yourself.’ Here,\nfeel, give me your hand; don’t be afraid—it is here.”\n\n\nShe no longer wept, her voice was caressing; she placed Javert’s coarse\nhand on her delicate, white throat and looked smilingly at him.\n\nAll at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments, dropped the\nfolds of her skirt, which had been pushed up as she dragged herself\nalong, almost to the height of her knee, and stepped towards the door,\nsaying to the soldiers in a low voice, and with a friendly nod:—\n\n“Children, Monsieur l’Inspecteur has said that I am to be released, and\nI am going.”\n\n\nShe laid her hand on the latch of the door. One step more and she would\nbe in the street.\n\nJavert up to that moment had remained erect, motionless, with his eyes\nfixed on the ground, cast athwart this scene like some displaced\nstatue, which is waiting to be put away somewhere.\n\nThe sound of the latch roused him. He raised his head with an\nexpression of sovereign authority, an expression all the more alarming\nin proportion as the authority rests on a low level, ferocious in the\nwild beast, atrocious in the man of no estate.\n\n“Sergeant!” he cried, “don’t you see that that jade is walking off! Who\nbade you let her go?”\n\n\n“I,” said Madeleine.\n\nFantine trembled at the sound of Javert’s voice, and let go of the\nlatch as a thief relinquishes the article which he has stolen. At the\nsound of Madeleine’s voice she turned around, and from that moment\nforth she uttered no word, nor dared so much as to breathe freely, but\nher glance strayed from Madeleine to Javert, and from Javert to\nMadeleine in turn, according to which was speaking.\n\nIt was evident that Javert must have been exasperated beyond measure\nbefore he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant as he had\ndone, after the mayor’s suggestion that Fantine should be set at\nliberty. Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor’s presence?\nHad he finally declared to himself that it was impossible that any\n“authority” should have given such an order, and that the mayor must\ncertainly have said one thing by mistake for another, without intending\nit? Or, in view of the enormities of which he had been a witness for\nthe past two hours, did he say to himself, that it was necessary to\nrecur to supreme resolutions, that it was indispensable that the small\nshould be made great, that the police spy should transform himself into\na magistrate, that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice,\nand that, in this prodigious extremity, order, law, morality,\ngovernment, society in its entirety, was personified in him, Javert?\n\nHowever that may be, when M. Madeleine uttered that word, _I_, as we\nhave just heard, Police Inspector Javert was seen to turn toward the\nmayor, pale, cold, with blue lips, and a look of despair, his whole\nbody agitated by an imperceptible quiver and an unprecedented\noccurrence, and say to him, with downcast eyes but a firm voice:—\n\n“Mr. Mayor, that cannot be.”\n\n\n“Why not?” said M. Madeleine.\n\n“This miserable woman has insulted a citizen.”\n\n\n“Inspector Javert,” replied the mayor, in a calm and conciliating tone,\n“listen. You are an honest man, and I feel no hesitation in explaining\nmatters to you. Here is the true state of the case: I was passing\nthrough the square just as you were leading this woman away; there were\nstill groups of people standing about, and I made inquiries and learned\neverything; it was the townsman who was in the wrong and who should\nhave been arrested by properly conducted police.”\n\n\nJavert retorted:—\n\n“This wretch has just insulted Monsieur le Maire.”\n\n\n“That concerns me,” said M. Madeleine. “My own insult belongs to me, I\nthink. I can do what I please about it.”\n\n\n“I beg Monsieur le Maire’s pardon. The insult is not to him but to the\nlaw.”\n\n\n“Inspector Javert,” replied M. Madeleine, “the highest law is\nconscience. I have heard this woman; I know what I am doing.”\n\n\n“And I, Mr. Mayor, do not know what I see.”\n\n\n“Then content yourself with obeying.”\n\n\n“I am obeying my duty. My duty demands that this woman shall serve six\nmonths in prison.”\n\n\nM. Madeleine replied gently:—\n\n“Heed this well; she will not serve a single day.”\n\n\nAt this decisive word, Javert ventured to fix a searching look on the\nmayor and to say, but in a tone of voice that was still profoundly\nrespectful:—\n\n“I am sorry to oppose Monsieur le Maire; it is for the first time in my\nlife, but he will permit me to remark that I am within the bounds of my\nauthority. I confine myself, since Monsieur le Maire desires it, to the\nquestion of the gentleman. I was present. This woman flung herself on\nMonsieur Bamatabois, who is an elector and the proprietor of that\nhandsome house with a balcony, which forms the corner of the esplanade,\nthree stories high and entirely of cut stone. Such things as there are\nin the world! In any case, Monsieur le Maire, this is a question of\npolice regulations in the streets, and concerns me, and I shall detain\nthis woman Fantine.”\n\n\nThen M. Madeleine folded his arms, and said in a severe voice which no\none in the town had heard hitherto:—\n\n“The matter to which you refer is one connected with the municipal\npolice. According to the terms of articles nine, eleven, fifteen, and\nsixty-six of the code of criminal examination, I am the judge. I order\nthat this woman shall be set at liberty.”\n\n\nJavert ventured to make a final effort.\n\n“But, Mr. Mayor—”\n\n\n“I refer you to article eighty-one of the law of the 13th of December,\n1799, in regard to arbitrary detention.”\n\n\n“Monsieur le Maire, permit me—”\n\n\n“Not another word.”\n\n\n“But—”\n\n\n“Leave the room,” said M. Madeleine.\n\nJavert received the blow erect, full in the face, in his breast, like a\nRussian soldier. He bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left\nthe room.\n\nFantine stood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement as he\npassed.\n\nNevertheless, she also was the prey to a strange confusion. She had\njust seen herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers. She\nhad seen two men who held in their hands her liberty, her life, her\nsoul, her child, in combat before her very eyes; one of these men was\ndrawing her towards darkness, the other was leading her back towards\nthe light. In this conflict, viewed through the exaggerations of\nterror, these two men had appeared to her like two giants; the one\nspoke like her demon, the other like her good angel. The angel had\nconquered the demon, and, strange to say, that which made her shudder\nfrom head to foot was the fact that this angel, this liberator, was the\nvery man whom she abhorred, that mayor whom she had so long regarded as\nthe author of all her woes, that Madeleine! And at the very moment when\nshe had insulted him in so hideous a fashion, he had saved her! Had\nshe, then, been mistaken? Must she change her whole soul? She did not\nknow; she trembled. She listened in bewilderment, she looked on in\naffright, and at every word uttered by M. Madeleine she felt the\nfrightful shades of hatred crumble and melt within her, and something\nwarm and ineffable, indescribable, which was both joy, confidence and\nlove, dawn in her heart.\n\nWhen Javert had taken his departure, M. Madeleine turned to her and\nsaid to her in a deliberate voice, like a serious man who does not wish\nto weep and who finds some difficulty in speaking:—\n\n“I have heard you. I knew nothing about what you have mentioned. I\nbelieve that it is true, and I feel that it is true. I was even\nignorant of the fact that you had left my shop. Why did you not apply\nto me? But here; I will pay your debts, I will send for your child, or\nyou shall go to her. You shall live here, in Paris, or where you\nplease. I undertake the care of your child and yourself. You shall not\nwork any longer if you do not like. I will give all the money you\nrequire. You shall be honest and happy once more. And listen! I declare\nto you that if all is as you say,—and I do not doubt it,—you have never\nceased to be virtuous and holy in the sight of God. Oh! poor woman.”\n\n\nThis was more than Fantine could bear. To have Cosette! To leave this\nlife of infamy. To live free, rich, happy, respectable with Cosette; to\nsee all these realities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst of\nher misery. She stared stupidly at this man who was talking to her, and\ncould only give vent to two or three sobs, “Oh! Oh! Oh!”\n\n\nHer limbs gave way beneath her, she knelt in front of M. Madeleine, and\nbefore he could prevent her he felt her grasp his hand and press her\nlips to it.\n\nThen she fainted.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SIXTH—JAVERT\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE BEGINNING OF REPOSE\n\n\nM. Madeleine had Fantine removed to that infirmary which he had\nestablished in his own house. He confided her to the sisters, who put\nher to bed. A burning fever had come on. She passed a part of the night\nin delirium and raving. At length, however, she fell asleep.\n\nOn the morrow, towards midday, Fantine awoke. She heard some one\nbreathing close to her bed; she drew aside the curtain and saw M.\nMadeleine standing there and looking at something over her head. His\ngaze was full of pity, anguish, and supplication. She followed its\ndirection, and saw that it was fixed on a crucifix which was nailed to\nthe wall.\n\nThenceforth, M. Madeleine was transfigured in Fantine’s eyes. He seemed\nto her to be clothed in light. He was absorbed in a sort of prayer. She\ngazed at him for a long time without daring to interrupt him. At last\nshe said timidly:—\n\n“What are you doing?”\n\n\nM. Madeleine had been there for an hour. He had been waiting for\nFantine to awake. He took her hand, felt of her pulse, and replied:—\n\n“How do you feel?”\n\n\n“Well, I have slept,” she replied; “I think that I am better. It is\nnothing.”\n\n\nHe answered, responding to the first question which she had put to him\nas though he had just heard it:—\n\n“I was praying to the martyr there on high.”\n\n\nAnd he added in his own mind, “For the martyr here below.”\n\n\nM. Madeleine had passed the night and the morning in making inquiries.\nHe knew all now. He knew Fantine’s history in all its heart-rending\ndetails. He went on:—\n\n“You have suffered much, poor mother. Oh! do not complain; you now have\nthe dowry of the elect. It is thus that men are transformed into\nangels. It is not their fault they do not know how to go to work\notherwise. You see this hell from which you have just emerged is the\nfirst form of heaven. It was necessary to begin there.”\n\n\nHe sighed deeply. But she smiled on him with that sublime smile in\nwhich two teeth were lacking.\n\nThat same night, Javert wrote a letter. The next morning be posted it\nhimself at the office of M. sur M. It was addressed to Paris, and the\nsuperscription ran: _To Monsieur Chabouillet, Secretary of Monsieur le\nPréfet of Police_. As the affair in the station-house had been bruited\nabout, the post-mistress and some other persons who saw the letter\nbefore it was sent off, and who recognized Javert’s handwriting on the\ncover, thought that he was sending in his resignation.\n\nM. Madeleine made haste to write to the Thénardiers. Fantine owed them\none hundred and twenty francs. He sent them three hundred francs,\ntelling them to pay themselves from that sum, and to fetch the child\ninstantly to M. sur M., where her sick mother required her presence.\n\nThis dazzled Thénardier. “The devil!” said the man to his wife; “don’t\nlet’s allow the child to go. This lark is going to turn into a milch\ncow. I see through it. Some ninny has taken a fancy to the mother.”\n\n\nHe replied with a very well drawn-up bill for five hundred and some odd\nfrancs. In this memorandum two indisputable items figured up over three\nhundred francs,—one for the doctor, the other for the apothecary who\nhad attended and physicked Éponine and Azelma through two long\nillnesses. Cosette, as we have already said, had not been ill. It was\nonly a question of a trifling substitution of names. At the foot of the\nmemorandum Thénardier wrote, _Received on account, three hundred\nfrancs_.\n\nM. Madeleine immediately sent three hundred francs more, and wrote,\n“Make haste to bring Cosette.”\n\n\n“Christi!” said Thénardier, “let’s not give up the child.”\n\n\nIn the meantime, Fantine did not recover. She still remained in the\ninfirmary.\n\nThe sisters had at first only received and nursed “that woman” with\nrepugnance. Those who have seen the bas-reliefs of Rheims will recall\nthe inflation of the lower lip of the wise virgins as they survey the\nfoolish virgins. The ancient scorn of the vestals for the ambubajæ is\none of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity; the sisters\nfelt it with the double force contributed by religion. But in a few\ndays Fantine disarmed them. She said all kinds of humble and gentle\nthings, and the mother in her provoked tenderness. One day the sisters\nheard her say amid her fever: “I have been a sinner; but when I have my\nchild beside me, it will be a sign that God has pardoned me. While I\nwas leading a bad life, I should not have liked to have my Cosette with\nme; I could not have borne her sad, astonished eyes. It was for her\nsake that I did evil, and that is why God pardons me. I shall feel the\nbenediction of the good God when Cosette is here. I shall gaze at her;\nit will do me good to see that innocent creature. She knows nothing at\nall. She is an angel, you see, my sisters. At that age the wings have\nnot fallen off.”\n\n\nM. Madeleine went to see her twice a day, and each time she asked him:—\n\n“Shall I see my Cosette soon?”\n\n\nHe answered:—\n\n“To-morrow, perhaps. She may arrive at any moment. I am expecting her.”\n\n\nAnd the mother’s pale face grew radiant.\n\n“Oh!” she said, “how happy I am going to be!”\n\n\nWe have just said that she did not recover her health. On the contrary,\nher condition seemed to become more grave from week to week. That\nhandful of snow applied to her bare skin between her shoulder-blades\nhad brought about a sudden suppression of perspiration, as a\nconsequence of which the malady which had been smouldering within her\nfor many years was violently developed at last. At that time people\nwere beginning to follow the fine Laënnec’s fine suggestions in the\nstudy and treatment of chest maladies. The doctor sounded Fantine’s\nchest and shook his head.\n\nM. Madeleine said to the doctor:—\n\n“Well?”\n\n\n“Has she not a child which she desires to see?” said the doctor.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Well! Make haste and get it here!”\n\n\nM. Madeleine shuddered.\n\nFantine inquired:—\n\n“What did the doctor say?”\n\n\nM. Madeleine forced himself to smile.\n\n“He said that your child was to be brought speedily. That that would\nrestore your health.”\n\n\n“Oh!” she rejoined, “he is right! But what do those Thénardiers mean by\nkeeping my Cosette from me! Oh! she is coming. At last I behold\nhappiness close beside me!”\n\n\nIn the meantime Thénardier did not “let go of the child,” and gave a\nhundred insufficient reasons for it. Cosette was not quite well enough\nto take a journey in the winter. And then, there still remained some\npetty but pressing debts in the neighborhood, and they were collecting\nthe bills for them, etc., etc.\n\n“I shall send some one to fetch Cosette!” said Father Madeleine. “If\nnecessary, I will go myself.”\n\n\nHe wrote the following letter to Fantine’s dictation, and made her sign\nit:—\n\n“MONSIEUR THÉNARDIER:—\nYou will deliver Cosette to this person.\nYou will be paid for all the little things.\nI have the honor to salute you with respect.\n“FANTINE.”\n\n\nIn the meantime a serious incident occurred. Carve as we will the\nmysterious block of which our life is made, the black vein of destiny\nconstantly reappears in it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—HOW JEAN MAY BECOME CHAMP\n\n\nOne morning M. Madeleine was in his study, occupied in arranging in\nadvance some pressing matters connected with the mayor’s office, in\ncase he should decide to take the trip to Montfermeil, when he was\ninformed that Police Inspector Javert was desirous of speaking with\nhim. Madeleine could not refrain from a disagreeable impression on\nhearing this name. Javert had avoided him more than ever since the\naffair of the police-station, and M. Madeleine had not seen him.\n\n“Admit him,” he said.\n\nJavert entered.\n\nM. Madeleine had retained his seat near the fire, pen in hand, his eyes\nfixed on the docket which he was turning over and annotating, and which\ncontained the trials of the commission on highways for the infraction\nof police regulations. He did not disturb himself on Javert’s account.\nHe could not help thinking of poor Fantine, and it suited him to be\nglacial in his manner.\n\nJavert bestowed a respectful salute on the mayor, whose back was turned\nto him. The mayor did not look at him, but went on annotating this\ndocket.\n\nJavert advanced two or three paces into the study, and halted, without\nbreaking the silence.\n\nIf any physiognomist who had been familiar with Javert, and who had\nmade a lengthy study of this savage in the service of civilization,\nthis singular composite of the Roman, the Spartan, the monk, and the\ncorporal, this spy who was incapable of a lie, this unspotted police\nagent—if any physiognomist had known his secret and long-cherished\naversion for M. Madeleine, his conflict with the mayor on the subject\nof Fantine, and had examined Javert at that moment, he would have said\nto himself, “What has taken place?” It was evident to any one\nacquainted with that clear, upright, sincere, honest, austere, and\nferocious conscience, that Javert had but just gone through some great\ninterior struggle. Javert had nothing in his soul which he had not also\nin his countenance. Like violent people in general, he was subject to\nabrupt changes of opinion. His physiognomy had never been more peculiar\nand startling. On entering he bowed to M. Madeleine with a look in\nwhich there was neither rancor, anger, nor distrust; he halted a few\npaces in the rear of the mayor’s armchair, and there he stood,\nperfectly erect, in an attitude almost of discipline, with the cold,\ningenuous roughness of a man who has never been gentle and who has\nalways been patient; he waited without uttering a word, without making\na movement, in genuine humility and tranquil resignation, calm,\nserious, hat in hand, with eyes cast down, and an expression which was\nhalf-way between that of a soldier in the presence of his officer and a\ncriminal in the presence of his judge, until it should please the mayor\nto turn round. All the sentiments as well as all the memories which one\nmight have attributed to him had disappeared. That face, as\nimpenetrable and simple as granite, no longer bore any trace of\nanything but a melancholy depression. His whole person breathed\nlowliness and firmness and an indescribable courageous despondency.\n\nAt last the mayor laid down his pen and turned half round.\n\n“Well! What is it? What is the matter, Javert?”\n\n\nJavert remained silent for an instant as though collecting his ideas,\nthen raised his voice with a sort of sad solemnity, which did not,\nhowever, preclude simplicity.\n\n“This is the matter, Mr. Mayor; a culpable act has been committed.”\n\n\n“What act?”\n\n\n“An inferior agent of the authorities has failed in respect, and in the\ngravest manner, towards a magistrate. I have come to bring the fact to\nyour knowledge, as it is my duty to do.”\n\n\n“Who is the agent?” asked M. Madeleine.\n\n“I,” said Javert.\n\n“You?”\n\n\n“I.”\n\n\n“And who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent?”\n\n\n“You, Mr. Mayor.”\n\n\nM. Madeleine sat erect in his armchair. Javert went on, with a severe\nair and his eyes still cast down.\n\n“Mr. Mayor, I have come to request you to instigate the authorities to\ndismiss me.”\n\n\nM. Madeleine opened his mouth in amazement. Javert interrupted him:—\n\n“You will say that I might have handed in my resignation, but that does\nnot suffice. Handing in one’s resignation is honorable. I have failed\nin my duty; I ought to be punished; I must be turned out.”\n\n\nAnd after a pause he added:—\n\n“Mr. Mayor, you were severe with me the other day, and unjustly. Be so\nto-day, with justice.”\n\n\n“Come, now! Why?” exclaimed M. Madeleine. “What nonsense is this? What\nis the meaning of this? What culpable act have you been guilty of\ntowards me? What have you done to me? What are your wrongs with regard\nto me? You accuse yourself; you wish to be superseded—”\n\n\n“Turned out,” said Javert.\n\n“Turned out; so it be, then. That is well. I do not understand.”\n\n\n“You shall understand, Mr. Mayor.”\n\n\nJavert sighed from the very bottom of his chest, and resumed, still\ncoldly and sadly:—\n\n“Mr. Mayor, six weeks ago, in consequence of the scene over that woman,\nI was furious, and I informed against you.”\n\n\n“Informed against me!”\n\n\n“At the Prefecture of Police in Paris.”\n\n\nM. Madeleine, who was not in the habit of laughing much oftener than\nJavert himself, burst out laughing now:—\n\n“As a mayor who had encroached on the province of the police?”\n\n\n“As an ex-convict.”\n\n\nThe mayor turned livid.\n\nJavert, who had not raised his eyes, went on:—\n\n“I thought it was so. I had had an idea for a long time; a resemblance;\ninquiries which you had caused to be made at Faverolles; the strength\nof your loins; the adventure with old Fauchelevant; your skill in\nmarksmanship; your leg, which you drag a little;—I hardly know what\nall,—absurdities! But, at all events, I took you for a certain Jean\nValjean.”\n\n\n“A certain—What did you say the name was?”\n\n\n“Jean Valjean. He was a convict whom I was in the habit of seeing\ntwenty years ago, when I was adjutant-guard of convicts at Toulon. On\nleaving the galleys, this Jean Valjean, as it appears, robbed a bishop;\nthen he committed another theft, accompanied with violence, on a public\nhighway on the person of a little Savoyard. He disappeared eight years\nago, no one knows how, and he has been sought, I fancied. In short, I\ndid this thing! Wrath impelled me; I denounced you at the Prefecture!”\n\n\nM. Madeleine, who had taken up the docket again several moments before\nthis, resumed with an air of perfect indifference:—\n\n“And what reply did you receive?”\n\n\n“That I was mad.”\n\n\n“Well?”\n\n\n“Well, they were right.”\n\n\n“It is lucky that you recognize the fact.”\n\n\n“I am forced to do so, since the real Jean Valjean has been found.”\n\n\nThe sheet of paper which M. Madeleine was holding dropped from his\nhand; he raised his head, gazed fixedly at Javert, and said with his\nindescribable accent:—\n\n“Ah!”\n\n\nJavert continued:—\n\n“This is the way it is, Mr. Mayor. It seems that there was in the\nneighborhood near Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher an old fellow who was called\nFather Champmathieu. He was a very wretched creature. No one paid any\nattention to him. No one knows what such people subsist on. Lately,\nlast autumn, Father Champmathieu was arrested for the theft of some\ncider apples from—Well, no matter, a theft had been committed, a wall\nscaled, branches of trees broken. My Champmathieu was arrested. He\nstill had the branch of apple-tree in his hand. The scamp is locked up.\nUp to this point it was merely an affair of a misdemeanor. But here is\nwhere Providence intervened.\n\n“The jail being in a bad condition, the examining magistrate finds it\nconvenient to transfer Champmathieu to Arras, where the departmental\nprison is situated. In this prison at Arras there is an ex-convict\nnamed Brevet, who is detained for I know not what, and who has been\nappointed turnkey of the house, because of good behavior. Mr. Mayor, no\nsooner had Champmathieu arrived than Brevet exclaims: ‘Eh! Why, I know\nthat man! He is a _fagot!_4 Take a good look at me, my good man! You\nare Jean Valjean!’ ‘Jean Valjean! who’s Jean Valjean?’ Champmathieu\nfeigns astonishment. ‘Don’t play the innocent dodge,’ says Brevet. ‘You\nare Jean Valjean! You have been in the galleys of Toulon; it was twenty\nyears ago; we were there together.’ Champmathieu denies it. Parbleu!\nYou understand. The case is investigated. The thing was well ventilated\nfor me. This is what they discovered: This Champmathieu had been,\nthirty years ago, a pruner of trees in various localities, notably at\nFaverolles. There all trace of him was lost. A long time afterwards he\nwas seen again in Auvergne; then in Paris, where he is said to have\nbeen a wheelwright, and to have had a daughter, who was a laundress;\nbut that has not been proved. Now, before going to the galleys for\ntheft, what was Jean Valjean? A pruner of trees. Where? At Faverolles.\nAnother fact. This Valjean’s Christian name was Jean, and his mother’s\nsurname was Mathieu. What more natural to suppose than that, on\nemerging from the galleys, he should have taken his mother’s name for\nthe purpose of concealing himself, and have called himself Jean\nMathieu? He goes to Auvergne. The local pronunciation turns _Jean_ into\n_Chan_—he is called Chan Mathieu. Our man offers no opposition, and\nbehold him transformed into Champmathieu. You follow me, do you not?\nInquiries were made at Faverolles. The family of Jean Valjean is no\nlonger there. It is not known where they have gone. You know that among\nthose classes a family often disappears. Search was made, and nothing\nwas found. When such people are not mud, they are dust. And then, as\nthe beginning of the story dates thirty years back, there is no longer\nany one at Faverolles who knew Jean Valjean. Inquiries were made at\nToulon. Besides Brevet, there are only two convicts in existence who\nhave seen Jean Valjean; they are Cochepaille and Chenildieu, and are\nsentenced for life. They are taken from the galleys and confronted with\nthe pretended Champmathieu. They do not hesitate; he is Jean Valjean\nfor them as well as for Brevet. The same age,—he is fifty-four,—the\nsame height, the same air, the same man; in short, it is he. It was\nprecisely at this moment that I forwarded my denunciation to the\nPrefecture in Paris. I was told that I had lost my reason, and that\nJean Valjean is at Arras, in the power of the authorities. You can\nimagine whether this surprised me, when I thought that I had that same\nJean Valjean here. I write to the examining judge; he sends for me;\nChampmathieu is conducted to me—”\n\n\n“Well?” interposed M. Madeleine.\n\nJavert replied, his face incorruptible, and as melancholy as ever:—\n\n“Mr. Mayor, the truth is the truth. I am sorry; but that man is Jean\nValjean. I recognized him also.”\n\n\nM. Madeleine resumed in, a very low voice:—\n\n“You are sure?”\n\n\nJavert began to laugh, with that mournful laugh which comes from\nprofound conviction.\n\n“O! Sure!”\n\n\nHe stood there thoughtfully for a moment, mechanically taking pinches\nof powdered wood for blotting ink from the wooden bowl which stood on\nthe table, and he added:—\n\n“And even now that I have seen the real Jean Valjean, I do not see how\nI could have thought otherwise. I beg your pardon, Mr. Mayor.”\n\n\nJavert, as he addressed these grave and supplicating words to the man,\nwho six weeks before had humiliated him in the presence of the whole\nstation-house, and bade him “leave the room,”—Javert, that haughty man,\nwas unconsciously full of simplicity and dignity,—M. Madeleine made no\nother reply to his prayer than the abrupt question:—\n\n“And what does this man say?”\n\n\n“Ah! Indeed, Mr. Mayor, it’s a bad business. If he is Jean Valjean, he\nhas his previous conviction against him. To climb a wall, to break a\nbranch, to purloin apples, is a mischievous trick in a child; for a man\nit is a misdemeanor; for a convict it is a crime. Robbing and\nhousebreaking—it is all there. It is no longer a question of\ncorrectional police; it is a matter for the Court of Assizes. It is no\nlonger a matter of a few days in prison; it is the galleys for life.\nAnd then, there is the affair with the little Savoyard, who will\nreturn, I hope. The deuce! there is plenty to dispute in the matter, is\nthere not? Yes, for any one but Jean Valjean. But Jean Valjean is a sly\ndog. That is the way I recognized him. Any other man would have felt\nthat things were getting hot for him; he would struggle, he would cry\nout—the kettle sings before the fire; he would not be Jean Valjean, _et\ncetera_. But he has not the appearance of understanding; he says, ‘I am\nChampmathieu, and I won’t depart from that!’ He has an astonished air,\nhe pretends to be stupid; it is far better. Oh! the rogue is clever!\nBut it makes no difference. The proofs are there. He has been\nrecognized by four persons; the old scamp will be condemned. The case\nhas been taken to the Assizes at Arras. I shall go there to give my\ntestimony. I have been summoned.”\n\n\nM. Madeleine had turned to his desk again, and taken up his docket, and\nwas turning over the leaves tranquilly, reading and writing by turns,\nlike a busy man. He turned to Javert:—\n\n“That will do, Javert. In truth, all these details interest me but\nlittle. We are wasting our time, and we have pressing business on hand.\nJavert, you will betake yourself at once to the house of the woman\nBuseaupied, who sells herbs at the corner of the Rue Saint-Saulve. You\nwill tell her that she must enter her complaint against carter Pierre\nChesnelong. The man is a brute, who came near crushing this woman and\nher child. He must be punished. You will then go to M. Charcellay, Rue\nMontre-de-Champigny. He complained that there is a gutter on the\nadjoining house which discharges rain-water on his premises, and is\nundermining the foundations of his house. After that, you will verify\nthe infractions of police regulations which have been reported to me in\nthe Rue Guibourg, at Widow Doris’s, and Rue du Garraud-Blanc, at Madame\nRenée le Bossé‘s, and you will prepare documents. But I am giving you a\ngreat deal of work. Are you not to be absent? Did you not tell me that\nyou were going to Arras on that matter in a week or ten days?”\n\n\n“Sooner than that, Mr. Mayor.”\n\n\n“On what day, then?”\n\n\n“Why, I thought that I had said to Monsieur le Maire that the case was\nto be tried to-morrow, and that I am to set out by diligence to-night.”\n\n\nM. Madeleine made an imperceptible movement.\n\n“And how long will the case last?”\n\n\n“One day, at the most. The judgment will be pronounced to-morrow\nevening at latest. But I shall not wait for the sentence, which is\ncertain; I shall return here as soon as my deposition has been taken.”\n\n\n“That is well,” said M. Madeleine.\n\nAnd he dismissed Javert with a wave of the hand.\n\nJavert did not withdraw.\n\n“Excuse me, Mr. Mayor,” said he.\n\n“What is it now?” demanded M. Madeleine.\n\n“Mr. Mayor, there is still something of which I must remind you.”\n\n\n“What is it?”\n\n\n“That I must be dismissed.”\n\n\nM. Madeleine rose.\n\n“Javert, you are a man of honor, and I esteem you. You exaggerate your\nfault. Moreover, this is an offence which concerns me. Javert, you\ndeserve promotion instead of degradation. I wish you to retain your\npost.”\n\n\nJavert gazed at M. Madeleine with his candid eyes, in whose depths his\nnot very enlightened but pure and rigid conscience seemed visible, and\nsaid in a tranquil voice:—\n\n“Mr. Mayor, I cannot grant you that.”\n\n\n“I repeat,” replied M. Madeleine, “that the matter concerns me.”\n\n\nBut Javert, heeding his own thought only, continued:—\n\n“So far as exaggeration is concerned, I am not exaggerating. This is\nthe way I reason: I have suspected you unjustly. That is nothing. It is\nour right to cherish suspicion, although suspicion directed above\nourselves is an abuse. But without proofs, in a fit of rage, with the\nobject of wreaking my vengeance, I have denounced you as a convict,\nyou, a respectable man, a mayor, a magistrate! That is serious, very\nserious. I have insulted authority in your person, I, an agent of the\nauthorities! If one of my subordinates had done what I have done, I\nshould have declared him unworthy of the service, and have expelled\nhim. Well? Stop, Mr. Mayor; one word more. I have often been severe in\nthe course of my life towards others. That is just. I have done well.\nNow, if I were not severe towards myself, all the justice that I have\ndone would become injustice. Ought I to spare myself more than others?\nNo! What! I should be good for nothing but to chastise others, and not\nmyself! Why, I should be a blackguard! Those who say, ‘That blackguard\nof a Javert!’ would be in the right. Mr. Mayor, I do not desire that\nyou should treat me kindly; your kindness roused sufficient bad blood\nin me when it was directed to others. I want none of it for myself. The\nkindness which consists in upholding a woman of the town against a\ncitizen, the police agent against the mayor, the man who is down\nagainst the man who is up in the world, is what I call false kindness.\nThat is the sort of kindness which disorganizes society. Good God! it\nis very easy to be kind; the difficulty lies in being just. Come! if\nyou had been what I thought you, I should not have been kind to you,\nnot I! You would have seen! Mr. Mayor, I must treat myself as I would\ntreat any other man. When I have subdued malefactors, when I have\nproceeded with vigor against rascals, I have often said to myself, ‘If\nyou flinch, if I ever catch you in fault, you may rest at your ease!’ I\nhave flinched, I have caught myself in a fault. So much the worse!\nCome, discharged, cashiered, expelled! That is well. I have arms. I\nwill till the soil; it makes no difference to me. Mr. Mayor, the good\nof the service demands an example. I simply require the discharge of\nInspector Javert.”\n\n\nAll this was uttered in a proud, humble, despairing, yet convinced\ntone, which lent indescribable grandeur to this singular, honest man.\n\n“We shall see,” said M. Madeleine.\n\nAnd he offered him his hand.\n\nJavert recoiled, and said in a wild voice:—\n\n“Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but this must not be. A mayor does not offer his\nhand to a police spy.”\n\n\nHe added between his teeth:—\n\n“A police spy, yes; from the moment when I have misused the police. I\nam no more than a police spy.”\n\n\nThen he bowed profoundly, and directed his steps towards the door.\n\nThere he wheeled round, and with eyes still downcast:—\n\n“Mr. Mayor,” he said, “I shall continue to serve until I am\nsuperseded.”\n\n\nHe withdrew. M. Madeleine remained thoughtfully listening to the firm,\nsure step, which died away on the pavement of the corridor.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SEVENTH—THE CHAMPMATHIEU AFFAIR\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—SISTER SIMPLICE\n\n\nThe incidents the reader is about to peruse were not all known at M.\nsur M. But the small portion of them which became known left such a\nmemory in that town that a serious gap would exist in this book if we\ndid not narrate them in their most minute details. Among these details\nthe reader will encounter two or three improbable circumstances, which\nwe preserve out of respect for the truth.\n\nOn the afternoon following the visit of Javert, M. Madeleine went to\nsee Fantine according to his wont.\n\nBefore entering Fantine’s room, he had Sister Simplice summoned.\n\nThe two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary,\nLazariste ladies, like all sisters of charity, bore the names of Sister\nPerpétue and Sister Simplice.\n\nSister Perpétue was an ordinary villager, a sister of charity in a\ncoarse style, who had entered the service of God as one enters any\nother service. She was a nun as other women are cooks. This type is not\nso very rare. The monastic orders gladly accept this heavy peasant\nearthenware, which is easily fashioned into a Capuchin or an Ursuline.\nThese rustics are utilized for the rough work of devotion. The\ntransition from a drover to a Carmelite is not in the least violent;\nthe one turns into the other without much effort; the fund of ignorance\ncommon to the village and the cloister is a preparation ready at hand,\nand places the boor at once on the same footing as the monk: a little\nmore amplitude in the smock, and it becomes a frock. Sister Perpétue\nwas a robust nun from Marines near Pontoise, who chattered her patois,\ndroned, grumbled, sugared the potion according to the bigotry or the\nhypocrisy of the invalid, treated her patients abruptly, roughly, was\ncrabbed with the dying, almost flung God in their faces, stoned their\ndeath agony with prayers mumbled in a rage; was bold, honest, and\nruddy.\n\nSister Simplice was white, with a waxen pallor. Beside Sister Perpétue,\nshe was the taper beside the candle. Vincent de Paul has divinely\ntraced the features of the Sister of Charity in these admirable words,\nin which he mingles as much freedom as servitude: “They shall have for\ntheir convent only the house of the sick; for cell only a hired room;\nfor chapel only their parish church; for cloister only the streets of\nthe town and the wards of the hospitals; for enclosure only obedience;\nfor gratings only the fear of God; for veil only modesty.” This ideal\nwas realized in the living person of Sister Simplice: she had never\nbeen young, and it seemed as though she would never grow old. No one\ncould have told Sister Simplice’s age. She was a person—we dare not say\na woman—who was gentle, austere, well-bred, cold, and who had never\nlied. She was so gentle that she appeared fragile; but she was more\nsolid than granite. She touched the unhappy with fingers that were\ncharmingly pure and fine. There was, so to speak, silence in her\nspeech; she said just what was necessary, and she possessed a tone of\nvoice which would have equally edified a confessional or enchanted a\ndrawing-room. This delicacy accommodated itself to the serge gown,\nfinding in this harsh contact a continual reminder of heaven and of\nGod. Let us emphasize one detail. Never to have lied, never to have\nsaid, for any interest whatever, even in indifference, any single thing\nwhich was not the truth, the sacred truth, was Sister Simplice’s\ndistinctive trait; it was the accent of her virtue. She was almost\nrenowned in the congregation for this imperturbable veracity. The Abbé\nSicard speaks of Sister Simplice in a letter to the deaf-mute Massieu.\nHowever pure and sincere we may be, we all bear upon our candor the\ncrack of the little, innocent lie. She did not. Little lie, innocent\nlie—does such a thing exist? To lie is the absolute form of evil. To\nlie a little is not possible: he who lies, lies the whole lie. To lie\nis the very face of the demon. Satan has two names; he is called Satan\nand Lying. That is what she thought; and as she thought, so she did.\nThe result was the whiteness which we have mentioned—a whiteness which\ncovered even her lips and her eyes with radiance. Her smile was white,\nher glance was white. There was not a single spider’s web, not a grain\nof dust, on the glass window of that conscience. On entering the order\nof Saint Vincent de Paul, she had taken the name of Simplice by special\nchoice. Simplice of Sicily, as we know, is the saint who preferred to\nallow both her breasts to be torn off rather than to say that she had\nbeen born at Segesta when she had been born at Syracuse—a lie which\nwould have saved her. This patron saint suited this soul.\n\nSister Simplice, on her entrance into the order, had had two faults\nwhich she had gradually corrected: she had a taste for dainties, and\nshe liked to receive letters. She never read anything but a book of\nprayers printed in Latin, in coarse type. She did not understand Latin,\nbut she understood the book.\n\nThis pious woman had conceived an affection for Fantine, probably\nfeeling a latent virtue there, and she had devoted herself almost\nexclusively to her care.\n\nM. Madeleine took Sister Simplice apart and recommended Fantine to her\nin a singular tone, which the sister recalled later on.\n\nOn leaving the sister, he approached Fantine.\n\nFantine awaited M. Madeleine’s appearance every day as one awaits a ray\nof warmth and joy. She said to the sisters, “I only live when Monsieur\nle Maire is here.”\n\n\nShe had a great deal of fever that day. As soon as she saw M. Madeleine\nshe asked him:—\n\n“And Cosette?”\n\n\nHe replied with a smile:—\n\n“Soon.”\n\n\nM. Madeleine was the same as usual with Fantine. Only he remained an\nhour instead of half an hour, to Fantine’s great delight. He urged\nevery one repeatedly not to allow the invalid to want for anything. It\nwas noticed that there was a moment when his countenance became very\nsombre. But this was explained when it became known that the doctor had\nbent down to his ear and said to him, “She is losing ground fast.”\n\n\nThen he returned to the town-hall, and the clerk observed him\nattentively examining a road map of France which hung in his study. He\nwrote a few figures on a bit of paper with a pencil.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—THE PERSPICACITY OF MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE\n\n\nFrom the town-hall he betook himself to the extremity of the town, to a\nFleming named Master Scaufflaer, French Scaufflaire, who let out\n“horses and cabriolets as desired.”\n\n\nIn order to reach this Scaufflaire, the shortest way was to take the\nlittle-frequented street in which was situated the parsonage of the\nparish in which M. Madeleine resided. The curé was, it was said, a\nworthy, respectable, and sensible man. At the moment when M. Madeleine\narrived in front of the parsonage there was but one passer-by in the\nstreet, and this person noticed this: After the mayor had passed the\npriest’s house he halted, stood motionless, then turned about, and\nretraced his steps to the door of the parsonage, which had an iron\nknocker. He laid his hand quickly on the knocker and lifted it; then he\npaused again and stopped short, as though in thought, and after the\nlapse of a few seconds, instead of allowing the knocker to fall\nabruptly, he placed it gently, and resumed his way with a sort of haste\nwhich had not been apparent previously.\n\nM. Madeleine found Master Scaufflaire at home, engaged in stitching a\nharness over.\n\n“Master Scaufflaire,” he inquired, “have you a good horse?”\n\n\n“Mr. Mayor,” said the Fleming, “all my horses are good. What do you\nmean by a good horse?”\n\n\n“I mean a horse which can travel twenty leagues in a day.”\n\n\n“The deuce!” said the Fleming. “Twenty leagues!”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Hitched to a cabriolet?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“And how long can he rest at the end of his journey?”\n\n\n“He must be able to set out again on the next day if necessary.”\n\n\n“To traverse the same road?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“The deuce! the deuce! And it is twenty leagues?”\n\n\nM. Madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he had pencilled\nsome figures. He showed it to the Fleming. The figures were 5, 6, 8½.\n\n“You see,” he said, “total, nineteen and a half; as well say twenty\nleagues.”\n\n\n“Mr. Mayor,” returned the Fleming, “I have just what you want. My\nlittle white horse—you may have seen him pass occasionally; he is a\nsmall beast from Lower Boulonnais. He is full of fire. They wanted to\nmake a saddle-horse of him at first. Bah! He reared, he kicked, he laid\neverybody flat on the ground. He was thought to be vicious, and no one\nknew what to do with him. I bought him. I harnessed him to a carriage.\nThat is what he wanted, sir; he is as gentle as a girl; he goes like\nthe wind. Ah! indeed he must not be mounted. It does not suit his ideas\nto be a saddle-horse. Every one has his ambition. ‘Draw? Yes. Carry?\nNo.’ We must suppose that is what he said to himself.”\n\n\n“And he will accomplish the trip?”\n\n\n“Your twenty leagues all at a full trot, and in less than eight hours.\nBut here are the conditions.”\n\n\n“State them.”\n\n\n“In the first place, you will give him half an hour’s breathing spell\nmidway of the road; he will eat; and some one must be by while he is\neating to prevent the stable boy of the inn from stealing his oats; for\nI have noticed that in inns the oats are more often drunk by the stable\nmen than eaten by the horses.”\n\n\n“Some one will be by.”\n\n\n“In the second place—is the cabriolet for Monsieur le Maire?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Does Monsieur le Maire know how to drive?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Well, Monsieur le Maire will travel alone and without baggage, in\norder not to overload the horse?”\n\n\n“Agreed.”\n\n\n“But as Monsieur le Maire will have no one with him, he will be obliged\nto take the trouble himself of seeing that the oats are not stolen.”\n\n\n“That is understood.”\n\n\n“I am to have thirty francs a day. The days of rest to be paid for\nalso—not a farthing less; and the beast’s food to be at Monsieur le\nMaire’s expense.”\n\n\nM. Madeleine drew three napoleons from his purse and laid them on the\ntable.\n\n“Here is the pay for two days in advance.”\n\n\n“Fourthly, for such a journey a cabriolet would be too heavy, and would\nfatigue the horse. Monsieur le Maire must consent to travel in a little\ntilbury that I own.”\n\n\n“I consent to that.”\n\n\n“It is light, but it has no cover.”\n\n\n“That makes no difference to me.”\n\n\n“Has Monsieur le Maire reflected that we are in the middle of winter?”\n\n\nM. Madeleine did not reply. The Fleming resumed:—\n\n“That it is very cold?”\n\n\nM. Madeleine preserved silence.\n\nMaster Scaufflaire continued:—\n\n“That it may rain?”\n\n\nM. Madeleine raised his head and said:—\n\n“The tilbury and the horse will be in front of my door to-morrow\nmorning at half-past four o’clock.”\n\n\n“Of course, Monsieur le Maire,” replied Scaufflaire; then, scratching a\nspeck in the wood of the table with his thumb-nail, he resumed with\nthat careless air which the Flemings understand so well how to mingle\nwith their shrewdness:—\n\n“But this is what I am thinking of now: Monsieur le Maire has not told\nme where he is going. Where is Monsieur le Maire going?”\n\n\nHe had been thinking of nothing else since the beginning of the\nconversation, but he did not know why he had not dared to put the\nquestion.\n\n“Are your horse’s forelegs good?” said M. Madeleine.\n\n“Yes, Monsieur le Maire. You must hold him in a little when going down\nhill. Are there many descends between here and the place whither you\nare going?”\n\n\n“Do not forget to be at my door at precisely half-past four o’clock\nto-morrow morning,” replied M. Madeleine; and he took his departure.\n\nThe Fleming remained “utterly stupid,” as he himself said some time\nafterwards.\n\nThe mayor had been gone two or three minutes when the door opened\nagain; it was the mayor once more.\n\nHe still wore the same impassive and preoccupied air.\n\n“Monsieur Scaufflaire,” said he, “at what sum do you estimate the value\nof the horse and tilbury which you are to let to me,—the one bearing\nthe other?”\n\n\n“The one dragging the other, Monsieur le Maire,” said the Fleming, with\na broad smile.\n\n“So be it. Well?”\n\n\n“Does Monsieur le Maire wish to purchase them or me?”\n\n\n“No; but I wish to guarantee you in any case. You shall give me back\nthe sum at my return. At what value do you estimate your horse and\ncabriolet?”\n\n\n“Five hundred francs, Monsieur le Maire.”\n\n\n“Here it is.”\n\n\nM. Madeleine laid a bank-bill on the table, then left the room; and\nthis time he did not return.\n\nMaster Scaufflaire experienced a frightful regret that he had not said\na thousand francs. Besides the horse and tilbury together were worth\nbut a hundred crowns.\n\nThe Fleming called his wife, and related the affair to her. “Where the\ndevil could Monsieur le Maire be going?” They held counsel together.\n“He is going to Paris,” said the wife. “I don’t believe it,” said the\nhusband.\n\nM. Madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it, and it lay\non the chimney-piece. The Fleming picked it up and studied it. “Five,\nsix, eight and a half? That must designate the posting relays.” He\nturned to his wife:—\n\n“I have found out.”\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“It is five leagues from here to Hesdin, six from Hesdin to Saint-Pol,\neight and a half from Saint-Pol to Arras. He is going to Arras.”\n\n\nMeanwhile, M. Madeleine had returned home. He had taken the longest way\nto return from Master Scaufflaire’s, as though the parsonage door had\nbeen a temptation for him, and he had wished to avoid it. He ascended\nto his room, and there he shut himself up, which was a very simple act,\nsince he liked to go to bed early. Nevertheless, the portress of the\nfactory, who was, at the same time, M. Madeleine’s only servant,\nnoticed that the latter’s light was extinguished at half-past eight,\nand she mentioned it to the cashier when he came home, adding:—\n\n“Is Monsieur le Maire ill? I thought he had a rather singular air.”\n\n\nThis cashier occupied a room situated directly under M. Madeleine’s\nchamber. He paid no heed to the portress’s words, but went to bed and\nto sleep. Towards midnight he woke up with a start; in his sleep he had\nheard a noise above his head. He listened; it was a footstep pacing\nback and forth, as though some one were walking in the room above him.\nHe listened more attentively, and recognized M. Madeleine’s step. This\nstruck him as strange; usually, there was no noise in M. Madeleine’s\nchamber until he rose in the morning. A moment later the cashier heard\na noise which resembled that of a cupboard being opened, and then shut\nagain; then a piece of furniture was disarranged; then a pause ensued;\nthen the step began again. The cashier sat up in bed, quite awake now,\nand staring; and through his window-panes he saw the reddish gleam of a\nlighted window reflected on the opposite wall; from the direction of\nthe rays, it could only come from the window of M. Madeleine’s chamber.\nThe reflection wavered, as though it came rather from a fire which had\nbeen lighted than from a candle. The shadow of the window-frame was not\nshown, which indicated that the window was wide open. The fact that\nthis window was open in such cold weather was surprising. The cashier\nfell asleep again. An hour or two later he waked again. The same step\nwas still passing slowly and regularly back and forth overhead.\n\nThe reflection was still visible on the wall, but now it was pale and\npeaceful, like the reflection of a lamp or of a candle. The window was\nstill open.\n\nThis is what had taken place in M. Madeleine’s room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—A TEMPEST IN A SKULL\n\n\nThe reader has, no doubt, already divined that M. Madeleine is no other\nthan Jean Valjean.\n\nWe have already gazed into the depths of this conscience; the moment\nhas now come when we must take another look into it. We do so not\nwithout emotion and trepidation. There is nothing more terrible in\nexistence than this sort of contemplation. The eye of the spirit can\nnowhere find more dazzling brilliance and more shadow than in man; it\ncan fix itself on no other thing which is more formidable, more\ncomplicated, more mysterious, and more infinite. There is a spectacle\nmore grand than the sea; it is heaven: there is a spectacle more grand\nthan heaven; it is the inmost recesses of the soul.\n\nTo make the poem of the human conscience, were it only with reference\nto a single man, were it only in connection with the basest of men,\nwould be to blend all epics into one superior and definitive epic.\nConscience is the chaos of chimæras, of lusts, and of temptations; the\nfurnace of dreams; the lair of ideas of which we are ashamed; it is the\npandemonium of sophisms; it is the battlefield of the passions.\nPenetrate, at certain hours, past the livid face of a human being who\nis engaged in reflection, and look behind, gaze into that soul, gaze\ninto that obscurity. There, beneath that external silence, battles of\ngiants, like those recorded in Homer, are in progress; skirmishes of\ndragons and hydras and swarms of phantoms, as in Milton; visionary\ncircles, as in Dante. What a solemn thing is this infinity which every\nman bears within him, and which he measures with despair against the\ncaprices of his brain and the actions of his life!\n\nAlighieri one day met with a sinister-looking door, before which he\nhesitated. Here is one before us, upon whose threshold we hesitate. Let\nus enter, nevertheless.\n\nWe have but little to add to what the reader already knows of what had\nhappened to Jean Valjean after the adventure with Little Gervais. From\nthat moment forth he was, as we have seen, a totally different man.\nWhat the Bishop had wished to make of him, that he carried out. It was\nmore than a transformation; it was a transfiguration.\n\nHe succeeded in disappearing, sold the Bishop’s silver, reserving only\nthe candlesticks as a souvenir, crept from town to town, traversed\nFrance, came to M. sur M., conceived the idea which we have mentioned,\naccomplished what we have related, succeeded in rendering himself safe\nfrom seizure and inaccessible, and, thenceforth, established at M. sur\nM., happy in feeling his conscience saddened by the past and the first\nhalf of his existence belied by the last, he lived in peace, reassured\nand hopeful, having henceforth only two thoughts,—to conceal his name\nand to sanctify his life; to escape men and to return to God.\n\nThese two thoughts were so closely intertwined in his mind that they\nformed but a single one there; both were equally absorbing and\nimperative and ruled his slightest actions. In general, they conspired\nto regulate the conduct of his life; they turned him towards the gloom;\nthey rendered him kindly and simple; they counselled him to the same\nthings. Sometimes, however, they conflicted. In that case, as the\nreader will remember, the man whom all the country of M. sur M. called\nM. Madeleine did not hesitate to sacrifice the first to the second—his\nsecurity to his virtue. Thus, in spite of all his reserve and all his\nprudence, he had preserved the Bishop’s candlesticks, worn mourning for\nhim, summoned and interrogated all the little Savoyards who passed that\nway, collected information regarding the families at Faverolles, and\nsaved old Fauchelevent’s life, despite the disquieting insinuations of\nJavert. It seemed, as we have already remarked, as though he thought,\nfollowing the example of all those who have been wise, holy, and just,\nthat his first duty was not towards himself.\n\nAt the same time, it must be confessed, nothing just like this had yet\npresented itself.\n\nNever had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose sufferings\nwe are narrating, engaged in so serious a struggle. He understood this\nconfusedly but profoundly at the very first words pronounced by Javert,\nwhen the latter entered his study. At the moment when that name, which\nhe had buried beneath so many layers, was so strangely articulated, he\nwas struck with stupor, and as though intoxicated with the sinister\neccentricity of his destiny; and through this stupor he felt that\nshudder which precedes great shocks. He bent like an oak at the\napproach of a storm, like a soldier at the approach of an assault. He\nfelt shadows filled with thunders and lightnings descending upon his\nhead. As he listened to Javert, the first thought which occurred to him\nwas to go, to run and denounce himself, to take that Champmathieu out\nof prison and place himself there; this was as painful and as poignant\nas an incision in the living flesh. Then it passed away, and he said to\nhimself, “We will see! We will see!” He repressed this first, generous\ninstinct, and recoiled before heroism.\n\nIt would be beautiful, no doubt, after the Bishop’s holy words, after\nso many years of repentance and abnegation, in the midst of a penitence\nadmirably begun, if this man had not flinched for an instant, even in\nthe presence of so terrible a conjecture, but had continued to walk\nwith the same step towards this yawning precipice, at the bottom of\nwhich lay heaven; that would have been beautiful; but it was not thus.\nWe must render an account of the things which went on in this soul, and\nwe can only tell what there was there. He was carried away, at first,\nby the instinct of self-preservation; he rallied all his ideas in\nhaste, stifled his emotions, took into consideration Javert’s presence,\nthat great danger, postponed all decision with the firmness of terror,\nshook off thought as to what he had to do, and resumed his calmness as\na warrior picks up his buckler.\n\nHe remained in this state during the rest of the day, a whirlwind\nwithin, a profound tranquillity without. He took no “preservative\nmeasures,” as they may be called. Everything was still confused, and\njostling together in his brain. His trouble was so great that he could\nnot perceive the form of a single idea distinctly, and he could have\ntold nothing about himself, except that he had received a great blow.\n\nHe repaired to Fantine’s bed of suffering, as usual, and prolonged his\nvisit, through a kindly instinct, telling himself that he must behave\nthus, and recommend her well to the sisters, in case he should be\nobliged to be absent himself. He had a vague feeling that he might be\nobliged to go to Arras; and without having the least in the world made\nup his mind to this trip, he said to himself that being, as he was,\nbeyond the shadow of any suspicion, there could be nothing out of the\nway in being a witness to what was to take place, and he engaged the\ntilbury from Scaufflaire in order to be prepared in any event.\n\nHe dined with a good deal of appetite.\n\nOn returning to his room, he communed with himself.\n\nHe examined the situation, and found it unprecedented; so unprecedented\nthat in the midst of his reverie he rose from his chair, moved by some\ninexplicable impulse of anxiety, and bolted his door. He feared lest\nsomething more should enter. He was barricading himself against\npossibilities.\n\nA moment later he extinguished his light; it embarrassed him.\n\nIt seemed to him as though he might be seen.\n\nBy whom?\n\nAlas! That on which he desired to close the door had already entered;\nthat which he desired to blind was staring him in the face,—his\nconscience.\n\nHis conscience; that is to say, God.\n\nNevertheless, he deluded himself at first; he had a feeling of security\nand of solitude; the bolt once drawn, he thought himself impregnable;\nthe candle extinguished, he felt himself invisible. Then he took\npossession of himself: he set his elbows on the table, leaned his head\non his hand, and began to meditate in the dark.\n\n“Where do I stand? Am not I dreaming? What have I heard? Is it really\ntrue that I have seen that Javert, and that he spoke to me in that\nmanner? Who can that Champmathieu be? So he resembles me! Is it\npossible? When I reflect that yesterday I was so tranquil, and so far\nfrom suspecting anything! What was I doing yesterday at this hour? What\nis there in this incident? What will the end be? What is to be done?”\n\n\nThis was the torment in which he found himself. His brain had lost its\npower of retaining ideas; they passed like waves, and he clutched his\nbrow in both hands to arrest them.\n\nNothing but anguish extricated itself from this tumult which\noverwhelmed his will and his reason, and from which he sought to draw\nproof and resolution.\n\nHis head was burning. He went to the window and threw it wide open.\nThere were no stars in the sky. He returned and seated himself at the\ntable.\n\nThe first hour passed in this manner.\n\nGradually, however, vague outlines began to take form and to fix\nthemselves in his meditation, and he was able to catch a glimpse with\nprecision of the reality,—not the whole situation, but some of the\ndetails. He began by recognizing the fact that, critical and\nextraordinary as was this situation, he was completely master of it.\n\nThis only caused an increase of his stupor.\n\nIndependently of the severe and religious aim which he had assigned to\nhis actions, all that he had made up to that day had been nothing but a\nhole in which to bury his name. That which he had always feared most of\nall in his hours of self-communion, during his sleepless nights, was to\never hear that name pronounced; he had said to himself, that that would\nbe the end of all things for him; that on the day when that name made\nits reappearance it would cause his new life to vanish from about him,\nand—who knows?—perhaps even his new soul within him, also. He shuddered\nat the very thought that this was possible. Assuredly, if any one had\nsaid to him at such moments that the hour would come when that name\nwould ring in his ears, when the hideous words, Jean Valjean, would\nsuddenly emerge from the darkness and rise in front of him, when that\nformidable light, capable of dissipating the mystery in which he had\nenveloped himself, would suddenly blaze forth above his head, and that\nthat name would not menace him, that that light would but produce an\nobscurity more dense, that this rent veil would but increase the\nmystery, that this earthquake would solidify his edifice, that this\nprodigious incident would have no other result, so far as he was\nconcerned, if so it seemed good to him, than that of rendering his\nexistence at once clearer and more impenetrable, and that, out of his\nconfrontation with the phantom of Jean Valjean, the good and worthy\ncitizen Monsieur Madeleine would emerge more honored, more peaceful,\nand more respected than ever—if any one had told him that, he would\nhave tossed his head and regarded the words as those of a madman. Well,\nall this was precisely what had just come to pass; all that\naccumulation of impossibilities was a fact, and God had permitted these\nwild fancies to become real things!\n\nHis reverie continued to grow clearer. He came more and more to an\nunderstanding of his position.\n\nIt seemed to him that he had but just waked up from some inexplicable\ndream, and that he found himself slipping down a declivity in the\nmiddle of the night, erect, shivering, holding back all in vain, on the\nvery brink of the abyss. He distinctly perceived in the darkness a\nstranger, a man unknown to him, whom destiny had mistaken for him, and\nwhom she was thrusting into the gulf in his stead; in order that the\ngulf might close once more, it was necessary that some one, himself or\nthat other man, should fall into it: he had only let things take their\ncourse.\n\nThe light became complete, and he acknowledged this to himself: That\nhis place was empty in the galleys; that do what he would, it was still\nawaiting him; that the theft from little Gervais had led him back to\nit; that this vacant place would await him, and draw him on until he\nfilled it; that this was inevitable and fatal; and then he said to\nhimself, “that, at this moment, he had a substitute; that it appeared\nthat a certain Champmathieu had that ill luck, and that, as regards\nhimself, being present in the galleys in the person of that\nChampmathieu, present in society under the name of M. Madeleine, he had\nnothing more to fear, provided that he did not prevent men from sealing\nover the head of that Champmathieu this stone of infamy which, like the\nstone of the sepulchre, falls once, never to rise again.”\n\n\nAll this was so strange and so violent, that there suddenly took place\nin him that indescribable movement, which no man feels more than two or\nthree times in the course of his life, a sort of convulsion of the\nconscience which stirs up all that there is doubtful in the heart,\nwhich is composed of irony, of joy, and of despair, and which may be\ncalled an outburst of inward laughter.\n\nHe hastily relighted his candle.\n\n“Well, what then?” he said to himself; “what am I afraid of? What is\nthere in all that for me to think about? I am safe; all is over. I had\nbut one partly open door through which my past might invade my life,\nand behold that door is walled up forever! That Javert, who has been\nannoying me so long; that terrible instinct which seemed to have\ndivined me, which had divined me—good God! and which followed me\neverywhere; that frightful hunting-dog, always making a point at me, is\nthrown off the scent, engaged elsewhere, absolutely turned from the\ntrail: henceforth he is satisfied; he will leave me in peace; he has\nhis Jean Valjean. Who knows? it is even probable that he will wish to\nleave town! And all this has been brought about without any aid from\nme, and I count for nothing in it! Ah! but where is the misfortune in\nthis? Upon my honor, people would think, to see me, that some\ncatastrophe had happened to me! After all, if it does bring harm to\nsome one, that is not my fault in the least: it is Providence which has\ndone it all; it is because it wishes it so to be, evidently. Have I the\nright to disarrange what it has arranged? What do I ask now? Why should\nI meddle? It does not concern me; what! I am not satisfied: but what\nmore do I want? The goal to which I have aspired for so many years, the\ndream of my nights, the object of my prayers to Heaven,—security,—I\nhave now attained; it is God who wills it; I can do nothing against the\nwill of God, and why does God will it? In order that I may continue\nwhat I have begun, that I may do good, that I may one day be a grand\nand encouraging example, that it may be said at last, that a little\nhappiness has been attached to the penance which I have undergone, and\nto that virtue to which I have returned. Really, I do not understand\nwhy I was afraid, a little while ago, to enter the house of that good\ncuré, and to ask his advice; this is evidently what he would have said\nto me: It is settled; let things take their course; let the good God do\nas he likes!”\n\n\nThus did he address himself in the depths of his own conscience,\nbending over what may be called his own abyss; he rose from his chair,\nand began to pace the room: “Come,” said he, “let us think no more\nabout it; my resolve is taken!” but he felt no joy.\n\nQuite the reverse.\n\nOne can no more prevent thought from recurring to an idea than one can\nthe sea from returning to the shore: the sailor calls it the tide; the\nguilty man calls it remorse; God upheaves the soul as he does the\nocean.\n\nAfter the expiration of a few moments, do what he would, he resumed the\ngloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he who listened,\nsaying that which he would have preferred to ignore, and listened to\nthat which he would have preferred not to hear, yielding to that\nmysterious power which said to him: “Think!” as it said to another\ncondemned man, two thousand years ago, “March on!”\n\n\nBefore proceeding further, and in order to make ourselves fully\nunderstood, let us insist upon one necessary observation.\n\nIt is certain that people do talk to themselves; there is no living\nbeing who has not done it. It may even be said that the word is never a\nmore magnificent mystery than when it goes from thought to conscience\nwithin a man, and when it returns from conscience to thought; it is in\nthis sense only that the words so often employed in this chapter, _he\nsaid, he exclaimed_, must be understood; one speaks to one’s self,\ntalks to one’s self, exclaims to one’s self without breaking the\nexternal silence; there is a great tumult; everything about us talks\nexcept the mouth. The realities of the soul are nonetheless realities\nbecause they are not visible and palpable.\n\nSo he asked himself where he stood. He interrogated himself upon that\n“settled resolve.” He confessed to himself that all that he had just\narranged in his mind was monstrous, that “to let things take their\ncourse, to let the good God do as he liked,” was simply horrible; to\nallow this error of fate and of men to be carried out, not to hinder\nit, to lend himself to it through his silence, to do nothing, in short,\nwas to do everything! that this was hypocritical baseness in the last\ndegree! that it was a base, cowardly, sneaking, abject, hideous crime!\n\nFor the first time in eight years, the wretched man had just tasted the\nbitter savor of an evil thought and of an evil action.\n\nHe spit it out with disgust.\n\nHe continued to question himself. He asked himself severely what he had\nmeant by this, “My object is attained!” He declared to himself that his\nlife really had an object; but what object? To conceal his name? To\ndeceive the police? Was it for so petty a thing that he had done all\nthat he had done? Had he not another and a grand object, which was the\ntrue one—to save, not his person, but his soul; to become honest and\ngood once more; to be a just man? Was it not that above all, that\nalone, which he had always desired, which the Bishop had enjoined upon\nhim—to shut the door on his past? But he was not shutting it! great\nGod! he was re-opening it by committing an infamous action! He was\nbecoming a thief once more, and the most odious of thieves! He was\nrobbing another of his existence, his life, his peace, his place in the\nsunshine. He was becoming an assassin. He was murdering, morally\nmurdering, a wretched man. He was inflicting on him that frightful\nliving death, that death beneath the open sky, which is called the\ngalleys. On the other hand, to surrender himself to save that man,\nstruck down with so melancholy an error, to resume his own name, to\nbecome once more, out of duty, the convict Jean Valjean, that was, in\ntruth, to achieve his resurrection, and to close forever that hell\nwhence he had just emerged; to fall back there in appearance was to\nescape from it in reality. This must be done! He had done nothing if he\ndid not do all this; his whole life was useless; all his penitence was\nwasted. There was no longer any need of saying, “What is the use?” He\nfelt that the Bishop was there, that the Bishop was present all the\nmore because he was dead, that the Bishop was gazing fixedly at him,\nthat henceforth Mayor Madeleine, with all his virtues, would be\nabominable to him, and that the convict Jean Valjean would be pure and\nadmirable in his sight; that men beheld his mask, but that the Bishop\nsaw his face; that men saw his life, but that the Bishop beheld his\nconscience. So he must go to Arras, deliver the false Jean Valjean, and\ndenounce the real one. Alas! that was the greatest of sacrifices, the\nmost poignant of victories, the last step to take; but it must be done.\nSad fate! he would enter into sanctity only in the eyes of God when he\nreturned to infamy in the eyes of men.\n\n“Well,” said he, “let us decide upon this; let us do our duty; let us\nsave this man.” He uttered these words aloud, without perceiving that\nhe was speaking aloud.\n\nHe took his books, verified them, and put them in order. He flung in\nthe fire a bundle of bills which he had against petty and embarrassed\ntradesmen. He wrote and sealed a letter, and on the envelope it might\nhave been read, had there been any one in his chamber at the moment,\n_To Monsieur Laffitte, Banker, Rue d’Artois, Paris_. He drew from his\nsecretary a pocket-book which contained several bank-notes and the\npassport of which he had made use that same year when he went to the\nelections.\n\nAny one who had seen him during the execution of these various acts,\ninto which there entered such grave thought, would have had no\nsuspicion of what was going on within him. Only occasionally did his\nlips move; at other times he raised his head and fixed his gaze upon\nsome point of the wall, as though there existed at that point something\nwhich he wished to elucidate or interrogate.\n\nWhen he had finished the letter to M. Laffitte, he put it into his\npocket, together with the pocket-book, and began his walk once more.\n\nHis reverie had not swerved from its course. He continued to see his\nduty clearly, written in luminous letters, which flamed before his eyes\nand changed its place as he altered the direction of his glance:—\n\n_“Go! Tell your name! Denounce yourself!”_\n\nIn the same way he beheld, as though they had passed before him in\nvisible forms, the two ideas which had, up to that time, formed the\ndouble rule of his soul,—the concealment of his name, the\nsanctification of his life. For the first time they appeared to him as\nabsolutely distinct, and he perceived the distance which separated\nthem. He recognized the fact that one of these ideas was, necessarily,\ngood, while the other might become bad; that the first was\nself-devotion, and that the other was personality; that the one said,\n_my neighbour_, and that the other said, _myself_; that one emanated\nfrom the light, and the other from darkness.\n\nThey were antagonistic. He saw them in conflict. In proportion as he\nmeditated, they grew before the eyes of his spirit. They had now\nattained colossal statures, and it seemed to him that he beheld within\nhimself, in that infinity of which we were recently speaking, in the\nmidst of the darkness and the lights, a goddess and a giant contending.\n\nHe was filled with terror; but it seemed to him that the good thought\nwas getting the upper hand.\n\nHe felt that he was on the brink of the second decisive crisis of his\nconscience and of his destiny; that the Bishop had marked the first\nphase of his new life, and that Champmathieu marked the second. After\nthe grand crisis, the grand test.\n\nBut the fever, allayed for an instant, gradually resumed possession of\nhim. A thousand thoughts traversed his mind, but they continued to\nfortify him in his resolution.\n\nOne moment he said to himself that he was, perhaps, taking the matter\ntoo keenly; that, after all, this Champmathieu was not interesting, and\nthat he had actually been guilty of theft.\n\nHe answered himself: “If this man has, indeed, stolen a few apples,\nthat means a month in prison. It is a long way from that to the\ngalleys. And who knows? Did he steal? Has it been proved? The name of\nJean Valjean overwhelms him, and seems to dispense with proofs. Do not\nthe attorneys for the Crown always proceed in this manner? He is\nsupposed to be a thief because he is known to be a convict.”\n\n\nIn another instant the thought had occurred to him that, when he\ndenounced himself, the heroism of his deed might, perhaps, be taken\ninto consideration, and his honest life for the last seven years, and\nwhat he had done for the district, and that they would have mercy on\nhim.\n\nBut this supposition vanished very quickly, and he smiled bitterly as\nhe remembered that the theft of the forty sous from little Gervais put\nhim in the position of a man guilty of a second offence after\nconviction, that this affair would certainly come up, and, according to\nthe precise terms of the law, would render him liable to penal\nservitude for life.\n\nHe turned aside from all illusions, detached himself more and more from\nearth, and sought strength and consolation elsewhere. He told himself\nthat he must do his duty; that perhaps he should not be more unhappy\nafter doing his duty than after having avoided it; that if he _allowed\nthings to take their own course_, if he remained at M. sur M., his\nconsideration, his good name, his good works, the deference and\nveneration paid to him, his charity, his wealth, his popularity, his\nvirtue, would be seasoned with a crime. And what would be the taste of\nall these holy things when bound up with this hideous thing? while, if\nhe accomplished his sacrifice, a celestial idea would be mingled with\nthe galleys, the post, the iron necklet, the green cap, unceasing toil,\nand pitiless shame.\n\nAt length he told himself that it must be so, that his destiny was thus\nallotted, that he had not authority to alter the arrangements made on\nhigh, that, in any case, he must make his choice: virtue without and\nabomination within, or holiness within and infamy without.\n\nThe stirring up of these lugubrious ideas did not cause his courage to\nfail, but his brain grow weary. He began to think of other things, of\nindifferent matters, in spite of himself.\n\nThe veins in his temples throbbed violently; he still paced to and fro;\nmidnight sounded first from the parish church, then from the town-hall;\nhe counted the twelve strokes of the two clocks, and compared the\nsounds of the two bells; he recalled in this connection the fact that,\na few days previously, he had seen in an ironmonger’s shop an ancient\nclock for sale, upon which was written the name, _Antoine-Albin de\nRomainville_.\n\nHe was cold; he lighted a small fire; it did not occur to him to close\nthe window.\n\nIn the meantime he had relapsed into his stupor; he was obliged to make\na tolerably vigorous effort to recall what had been the subject of his\nthoughts before midnight had struck; he finally succeeded in doing\nthis.\n\n“Ah! yes,” he said to himself, “I had resolved to inform against\nmyself.”\n\n\nAnd then, all of a sudden, he thought of Fantine.\n\n“Hold!” said he, “and what about that poor woman?”\n\n\nHere a fresh crisis declared itself.\n\nFantine, by appearing thus abruptly in his reverie, produced the effect\nof an unexpected ray of light; it seemed to him as though everything\nabout him were undergoing a change of aspect: he exclaimed:—\n\n“Ah! but I have hitherto considered no one but myself; it is proper for\nme to hold my tongue or to denounce myself, to conceal my person or to\nsave my soul, to be a despicable and respected magistrate, or an\ninfamous and venerable convict; it is I, it is always I and nothing but\nI: but, good God! all this is egotism; these are diverse forms of\negotism, but it is egotism all the same. What if I were to think a\nlittle about others? The highest holiness is to think of others; come,\nlet us examine the matter. The _I_ excepted, the _I_ effaced, the _I_\nforgotten, what would be the result of all this? What if I denounce\nmyself? I am arrested; this Champmathieu is released; I am put back in\nthe galleys; that is well—and what then? What is going on here? Ah!\nhere is a country, a town, here are factories, an industry, workers,\nboth men and women, aged grandsires, children, poor people! All this I\nhave created; all these I provide with their living; everywhere where\nthere is a smoking chimney, it is I who have placed the brand on the\nhearth and meat in the pot; I have created ease, circulation, credit;\nbefore me there was nothing; I have elevated, vivified, informed with\nlife, fecundated, stimulated, enriched the whole country-side; lacking\nme, the soul is lacking; I take myself off, everything dies: and this\nwoman, who has suffered so much, who possesses so many merits in spite\nof her fall; the cause of all whose misery I have unwittingly been! And\nthat child whom I meant to go in search of, whom I have promised to her\nmother; do I not also owe something to this woman, in reparation for\nthe evil which I have done her? If I disappear, what happens? The\nmother dies; the child becomes what it can; that is what will take\nplace, if I denounce myself. If I do not denounce myself? come, let us\nsee how it will be if I do not denounce myself.”\n\n\nAfter putting this question to himself, he paused; he seemed to undergo\na momentary hesitation and trepidation; but it did not last long, and\nhe answered himself calmly:—\n\n“Well, this man is going to the galleys; it is true, but what the\ndeuce! he has stolen! There is no use in my saying that he has not been\nguilty of theft, for he has! I remain here; I go on: in ten years I\nshall have made ten millions; I scatter them over the country; I have\nnothing of my own; what is that to me? It is not for myself that I am\ndoing it; the prosperity of all goes on augmenting; industries are\naroused and animated; factories and shops are multiplied; families, a\nhundred families, a thousand families, are happy; the district becomes\npopulated; villages spring up where there were only farms before; farms\nrise where there was nothing; wretchedness disappears, and with\nwretchedness debauchery, prostitution, theft, murder; all vices\ndisappear, all crimes: and this poor mother rears her child; and behold\na whole country rich and honest! Ah! I was a fool! I was absurd! what\nwas that I was saying about denouncing myself? I really must pay\nattention and not be precipitate about anything. What! because it would\nhave pleased me to play the grand and generous; this is melodrama,\nafter all; because I should have thought of no one but myself, the\nidea! for the sake of saving from a punishment, a trifle exaggerated,\nperhaps, but just at bottom, no one knows whom, a thief, a\ngood-for-nothing, evidently, a whole country-side must perish! a poor\nwoman must die in the hospital! a poor little girl must die in the\nstreet! like dogs; ah, this is abominable! And without the mother even\nhaving seen her child once more, almost without the child’s having\nknown her mother; and all that for the sake of an old wretch of an\napple-thief who, most assuredly, has deserved the galleys for something\nelse, if not for that; fine scruples, indeed, which save a guilty man\nand sacrifice the innocent, which save an old vagabond who has only a\nfew years to live at most, and who will not be more unhappy in the\ngalleys than in his hovel, and which sacrifice a whole population,\nmothers, wives, children. This poor little Cosette who has no one in\nthe world but me, and who is, no doubt, blue with cold at this moment\nin the den of those Thénardiers; those peoples are rascals; and I was\ngoing to neglect my duty towards all these poor creatures; and I was\ngoing off to denounce myself; and I was about to commit that\nunspeakable folly! Let us put it at the worst: suppose that there is a\nwrong action on my part in this, and that my conscience will reproach\nme for it some day, to accept, for the good of others, these reproaches\nwhich weigh only on myself; this evil action which compromises my soul\nalone; in that lies self-sacrifice; in that alone there is virtue.”\n\n\nHe rose and resumed his march; this time, he seemed to be content.\n\nDiamonds are found only in the dark places of the earth; truths are\nfound only in the depths of thought. It seemed to him, that, after\nhaving descended into these depths, after having long groped among the\ndarkest of these shadows, he had at last found one of these diamonds,\none of these truths, and that he now held it in his hand, and he was\ndazzled as he gazed upon it.\n\n“Yes,” he thought, “this is right; I am on the right road; I have the\nsolution; I must end by holding fast to something; my resolve is taken;\nlet things take their course; let us no longer vacillate; let us no\nlonger hang back; this is for the interest of all, not for my own; I am\nMadeleine, and Madeleine I remain. Woe to the man who is Jean Valjean!\nI am no longer he; I do not know that man; I no longer know anything;\nit turns out that some one is Jean Valjean at the present moment; let\nhim look out for himself; that does not concern me; it is a fatal name\nwhich was floating abroad in the night; if it halts and descends on a\nhead, so much the worse for that head.”\n\n\nHe looked into the little mirror which hung above his chimney-piece,\nand said:—\n\n“Hold! it has relieved me to come to a decision; I am quite another man\nnow.”\n\n\nHe proceeded a few paces further, then he stopped short.\n\n“Come!” he said, “I must not flinch before any of the consequences of\nthe resolution which I have once adopted; there are still threads which\nattach me to that Jean Valjean; they must be broken; in this very room\nthere are objects which would betray me, dumb things which would bear\nwitness against me; it is settled; all these things must disappear.”\n\n\nHe fumbled in his pocket, drew out his purse, opened it, and took out a\nsmall key; he inserted the key in a lock whose aperture could hardly be\nseen, so hidden was it in the most sombre tones of the design which\ncovered the wall-paper; a secret receptacle opened, a sort of false\ncupboard constructed in the angle between the wall and the\nchimney-piece; in this hiding-place there were some rags—a blue linen\nblouse, an old pair of trousers, an old knapsack, and a huge thorn\ncudgel shod with iron at both ends. Those who had seen Jean Valjean at\nthe epoch when he passed through D—— in October, 1815, could easily\nhave recognized all the pieces of this miserable outfit.\n\nHe had preserved them as he had preserved the silver candlesticks, in\norder to remind himself continually of his starting-point, but he had\nconcealed all that came from the galleys, and he had allowed the\ncandlesticks which came from the Bishop to be seen.\n\nHe cast a furtive glance towards the door, as though he feared that it\nwould open in spite of the bolt which fastened it; then, with a quick\nand abrupt movement, he took the whole in his arms at once, without\nbestowing so much as a glance on the things which he had so religiously\nand so perilously preserved for so many years, and flung them all,\nrags, cudgel, knapsack, into the fire.\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nCandlesticks Into the Fire  1b7-3-into-the-fire\n\n\nHe closed the false cupboard again, and with redoubled precautions,\nhenceforth unnecessary, since it was now empty, he concealed the door\nbehind a heavy piece of furniture, which he pushed in front of it.\n\nAfter the lapse of a few seconds, the room and the opposite wall were\nlighted up with a fierce, red, tremulous glow. Everything was on fire;\nthe thorn cudgel snapped and threw out sparks to the middle of the\nchamber.\n\nAs the knapsack was consumed, together with the hideous rags which it\ncontained, it revealed something which sparkled in the ashes. By\nbending over, one could have readily recognized a coin,—no doubt the\nforty-sou piece stolen from the little Savoyard.\n\nHe did not look at the fire, but paced back and forth with the same\nstep.\n\nAll at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks, which shone\nvaguely on the chimney-piece, through the glow.\n\n“Hold!” he thought; “the whole of Jean Valjean is still in them. They\nmust be destroyed also.”\n\n\nHe seized the two candlesticks.\n\nThere was still fire enough to allow of their being put out of shape,\nand converted into a sort of unrecognizable bar of metal.\n\nHe bent over the hearth and warmed himself for a moment. He felt a\nsense of real comfort. “How good warmth is!” said he.\n\nHe stirred the live coals with one of the candlesticks.\n\nA minute more, and they were both in the fire.\n\nAt that moment it seemed to him that he heard a voice within him\nshouting: “Jean Valjean! Jean Valjean!”\n\n\nHis hair rose upright: he became like a man who is listening to some\nterrible thing.\n\n“Yes, that’s it! finish!” said the voice. “Complete what you are about!\nDestroy these candlesticks! Annihilate this souvenir! Forget the\nBishop! Forget everything! Destroy this Champmathieu, do! That is\nright! Applaud yourself! So it is settled, resolved, fixed, agreed:\nhere is an old man who does not know what is wanted of him, who has,\nperhaps, done nothing, an innocent man, whose whole misfortune lies in\nyour name, upon whom your name weighs like a crime, who is about to be\ntaken for you, who will be condemned, who will finish his days in\nabjectness and horror. That is good! Be an honest man yourself; remain\nMonsieur le Maire; remain honorable and honored; enrich the town;\nnourish the indigent; rear the orphan; live happy, virtuous, and\nadmired; and, during this time, while you are here in the midst of joy\nand light, there will be a man who will wear your red blouse, who will\nbear your name in ignominy, and who will drag your chain in the\ngalleys. Yes, it is well arranged thus. Ah, wretch!”\n\n\nThe perspiration streamed from his brow. He fixed a haggard eye on the\ncandlesticks. But that within him which had spoken had not finished.\nThe voice continued:—\n\n“Jean Valjean, there will be around you many voices, which will make a\ngreat noise, which will talk very loud, and which will bless you, and\nonly one which no one will hear, and which will curse you in the dark.\nWell! listen, infamous man! All those benedictions will fall back\nbefore they reach heaven, and only the malediction will ascend to God.”\n\n\nThis voice, feeble at first, and which had proceeded from the most\nobscure depths of his conscience, had gradually become startling and\nformidable, and he now heard it in his very ear. It seemed to him that\nit had detached itself from him, and that it was now speaking outside\nof him. He thought that he heard the last words so distinctly, that he\nglanced around the room in a sort of terror.\n\n“Is there any one here?” he demanded aloud, in utter bewilderment.\n\nThen he resumed, with a laugh which resembled that of an idiot:—\n\n“How stupid I am! There can be no one!”\n\n\nThere was some one; but the person who was there was of those whom the\nhuman eye cannot see.\n\nHe placed the candlesticks on the chimney-piece.\n\nThen he resumed his monotonous and lugubrious tramp, which troubled the\ndreams of the sleeping man beneath him, and awoke him with a start.\n\nThis tramping to and fro soothed and at the same time intoxicated him.\nIt sometimes seems, on supreme occasions, as though people moved about\nfor the purpose of asking advice of everything that they may encounter\nby change of place. After the lapse of a few minutes he no longer knew\nhis position.\n\nHe now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolutions at which he\nhad arrived in turn. The two ideas which counselled him appeared to him\nequally fatal. What a fatality! What conjunction that that Champmathieu\nshould have been taken for him; to be overwhelmed by precisely the\nmeans which Providence seemed to have employed, at first, to strengthen\nhis position!\n\nThere was a moment when he reflected on the future. Denounce himself,\ngreat God! Deliver himself up! With immense despair he faced all that\nhe should be obliged to leave, all that he should be obliged to take up\nonce more. He should have to bid farewell to that existence which was\nso good, so pure, so radiant, to the respect of all, to honor, to\nliberty. He should never more stroll in the fields; he should never\nmore hear the birds sing in the month of May; he should never more\nbestow alms on the little children; he should never more experience the\nsweetness of having glances of gratitude and love fixed upon him; he\nshould quit that house which he had built, that little chamber!\nEverything seemed charming to him at that moment. Never again should he\nread those books; never more should he write on that little table of\nwhite wood; his old portress, the only servant whom he kept, would\nnever more bring him his coffee in the morning. Great God! instead of\nthat, the convict gang, the iron necklet, the red waistcoat, the chain\non his ankle, fatigue, the cell, the camp bed all those horrors which\nhe knew so well! At his age, after having been what he was! If he were\nonly young again! but to be addressed in his old age as “thou” by any\none who pleased; to be searched by the convict-guard; to receive the\ngalley-sergeant’s cudgellings; to wear iron-bound shoes on his bare\nfeet; to have to stretch out his leg night and morning to the hammer of\nthe roundsman who visits the gang; to submit to the curiosity of\nstrangers, who would be told: “That man yonder is the famous Jean\nValjean, who was mayor of M. sur M.”; and at night, dripping with\nperspiration, overwhelmed with lassitude, their green caps drawn over\ntheir eyes, to remount, two by two, the ladder staircase of the galleys\nbeneath the sergeant’s whip. Oh, what misery! Can destiny, then, be as\nmalicious as an intelligent being, and become as monstrous as the human\nheart?\n\nAnd do what he would, he always fell back upon the heartrending dilemma\nwhich lay at the foundation of his reverie: “Should he remain in\nparadise and become a demon? Should he return to hell and become an\nangel?”\n\n\nWhat was to be done? Great God! what was to be done?\n\nThe torment from which he had escaped with so much difficulty was\nunchained afresh within him. His ideas began to grow confused once\nmore; they assumed a kind of stupefied and mechanical quality which is\npeculiar to despair. The name of Romainville recurred incessantly to\nhis mind, with the two verses of a song which he had heard in the past.\nHe thought that Romainville was a little grove near Paris, where young\nlovers go to pluck lilacs in the month of April.\n\nHe wavered outwardly as well as inwardly. He walked like a little child\nwho is permitted to toddle alone.\n\nAt intervals, as he combated his lassitude, he made an effort to\nrecover the mastery of his mind. He tried to put to himself, for the\nlast time, and definitely, the problem over which he had, in a manner,\nfallen prostrate with fatigue: Ought he to denounce himself? Ought he\nto hold his peace? He could not manage to see anything distinctly. The\nvague aspects of all the courses of reasoning which had been sketched\nout by his meditations quivered and vanished, one after the other, into\nsmoke. He only felt that, to whatever course of action he made up his\nmind, something in him must die, and that of necessity, and without his\nbeing able to escape the fact; that he was entering a sepulchre on the\nright hand as much as on the left; that he was passing through a death\nagony,—the agony of his happiness, or the agony of his virtue.\n\nAlas! all his resolution had again taken possession of him. He was no\nfurther advanced than at the beginning.\n\nThus did this unhappy soul struggle in its anguish. Eighteen hundred\nyears before this unfortunate man, the mysterious Being in whom are\nsummed up all the sanctities and all the sufferings of humanity had\nalso long thrust aside with his hand, while the olive-trees quivered in\nthe wild wind of the infinite, the terrible cup which appeared to Him\ndripping with darkness and overflowing with shadows in the depths all\nstudded with stars.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—FORMS ASSUMED BY SUFFERING DURING SLEEP\n\n\nThree o’clock in the morning had just struck, and he had been walking\nthus for five hours, almost uninterruptedly, when he at length allowed\nhimself to drop into his chair.\n\nThere he fell asleep and had a dream.\n\nThis dream, like the majority of dreams, bore no relation to the\nsituation, except by its painful and heart-rending character, but it\nmade an impression on him. This nightmare struck him so forcibly that\nhe wrote it down later on. It is one of the papers in his own\nhandwriting which he has bequeathed to us. We think that we have here\nreproduced the thing in strict accordance with the text.\n\nOf whatever nature this dream may be, the history of this night would\nbe incomplete if we were to omit it: it is the gloomy adventure of an\nailing soul.\n\nHere it is. On the envelope we find this line inscribed, “The Dream I\nhad that Night.”\n\n\n“I was in a plain; a vast, gloomy plain, where there was no grass. It\ndid not seem to me to be daylight nor yet night.\n\n“I was walking with my brother, the brother of my childish years, the\nbrother of whom, I must say, I never think, and whom I now hardly\nremember.\n\n“We were conversing and we met some passers-by. We were talking of a\nneighbor of ours in former days, who had always worked with her window\nopen from the time when she came to live on the street. As we talked we\nfelt cold because of that open window.\n\n“There were no trees in the plain. We saw a man passing close to us. He\nwas entirely nude, of the hue of ashes, and mounted on a horse which\nwas earth color. The man had no hair; we could see his skull and the\nveins on it. In his hand he held a switch which was as supple as a\nvine-shoot and as heavy as iron. This horseman passed and said nothing\nto us.\n\n“My brother said to me, ‘Let us take to the hollow road.’\n\n“There existed a hollow way wherein one saw neither a single shrub nor\na spear of moss. Everything was dirt-colored, even the sky. After\nproceeding a few paces, I received no reply when I spoke: I perceived\nthat my brother was no longer with me.\n\n“I entered a village which I espied. I reflected that it must be\nRomainville. (Why Romainville?)5\n\n“The first street that I entered was deserted. I entered a second\nstreet. Behind the angle formed by the two streets, a man was standing\nerect against the wall. I said to this man:—\n\n“‘What country is this? Where am I?’ The man made no reply. I saw the\ndoor of a house open, and I entered.\n\n“The first chamber was deserted. I entered the second. Behind the door\nof this chamber a man was standing erect against the wall. I inquired\nof this man, ‘Whose house is this? Where am I?’ The man replied not.\n\n“The house had a garden. I quitted the house and entered the garden.\nThe garden was deserted. Behind the first tree I found a man standing\nupright. I said to this man, ‘What garden is this? Where am I?’ The man\ndid not answer.\n\n“I strolled into the village, and perceived that it was a town. All the\nstreets were deserted, all the doors were open. Not a single living\nbeing was passing in the streets, walking through the chambers or\nstrolling in the gardens. But behind each angle of the walls, behind\neach door, behind each tree, stood a silent man. Only one was to be\nseen at a time. These men watched me pass.\n\n“I left the town and began to ramble about the fields.\n\n“After the lapse of some time I turned back and saw a great crowd\ncoming up behind me. I recognized all the men whom I had seen in that\ntown. They had strange heads. They did not seem to be in a hurry, yet\nthey walked faster than I did. They made no noise as they walked. In an\ninstant this crowd had overtaken and surrounded me. The faces of these\nmen were earthen in hue.\n\n“Then the first one whom I had seen and questioned on entering the town\nsaid to me:—\n\n“‘Whither are you going! Do you not know that you have been dead this\nlong time?’\n\n“I opened my mouth to reply, and I perceived that there was no one near\nme.”\n\n\nHe woke. He was icy cold. A wind which was chill like the breeze of\ndawn was rattling the leaves of the window, which had been left open on\ntheir hinges. The fire was out. The candle was nearing its end. It was\nstill black night.\n\nHe rose, he went to the window. There were no stars in the sky even\nyet.\n\nFrom his window the yard of the house and the street were visible. A\nsharp, harsh noise, which made him drop his eyes, resounded from the\nearth.\n\nBelow him he perceived two red stars, whose rays lengthened and\nshortened in a singular manner through the darkness.\n\nAs his thoughts were still half immersed in the mists of sleep, “Hold!”\nsaid he, “there are no stars in the sky. They are on earth now.”\n\n\nBut this confusion vanished; a second sound similar to the first roused\nhim thoroughly; he looked and recognized the fact that these two stars\nwere the lanterns of a carriage. By the light which they cast he was\nable to distinguish the form of this vehicle. It was a tilbury\nharnessed to a small white horse. The noise which he had heard was the\ntrampling of the horse’s hoofs on the pavement.\n\n“What vehicle is this?” he said to himself. “Who is coming here so\nearly in the morning?”\n\n\nAt that moment there came a light tap on the door of his chamber.\n\nHe shuddered from head to foot, and cried in a terrible voice:—\n\n“Who is there?”\n\n\nSome one said:—\n\n“I, Monsieur le Maire.”\n\n\nHe recognized the voice of the old woman who was his portress.\n\n“Well!” he replied, “what is it?”\n\n\n“Monsieur le Maire, it is just five o’clock in the morning.”\n\n\n“What is that to me?”\n\n\n“The cabriolet is here, Monsieur le Maire.”\n\n\n“What cabriolet?”\n\n\n“The tilbury.”\n\n\n“What tilbury?”\n\n\n“Did not Monsieur le Maire order a tilbury?”\n\n\n“No,” said he.\n\n“The coachman says that he has come for Monsieur le Maire.”\n\n\n“What coachman?”\n\n\n“M. Scaufflaire’s coachman.”\n\n\n“M. Scaufflaire?”\n\n\nThat name sent a shudder over him, as though a flash of lightning had\npassed in front of his face.\n\n“Ah! yes,” he resumed; “M. Scaufflaire!”\n\n\nIf the old woman could have seen him at that moment, she would have\nbeen frightened.\n\nA tolerably long silence ensued. He examined the flame of the candle\nwith a stupid air, and from around the wick he took some of the burning\nwax, which he rolled between his fingers. The old woman waited for him.\nShe even ventured to uplift her voice once more:—\n\n“What am I to say, Monsieur le Maire?”\n\n\n“Say that it is well, and that I am coming down.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—HINDRANCES\n\n\nThe posting service from Arras to M. sur M. was still operated at this\nperiod by small mail-wagons of the time of the Empire. These\nmail-wagons were two-wheeled cabriolets, upholstered inside with\nfawn-colored leather, hung on springs, and having but two seats, one\nfor the postboy, the other for the traveller. The wheels were armed\nwith those long, offensive axles which keep other vehicles at a\ndistance, and which may still be seen on the road in Germany. The\ndespatch box, an immense oblong coffer, was placed behind the vehicle\nand formed a part of it. This coffer was painted black, and the\ncabriolet yellow.\n\nThese vehicles, which have no counterparts nowadays, had something\ndistorted and hunchbacked about them; and when one saw them passing in\nthe distance, and climbing up some road to the horizon, they resembled\nthe insects which are called, I think, termites, and which, though with\nbut little corselet, drag a great train behind them. But they travelled\nat a very rapid rate. The post-wagon which set out from Arras at one\no’clock every night, after the mail from Paris had passed, arrived at\nM. sur M. a little before five o’clock in the morning.\n\nThat night the wagon which was descending to M. sur M. by the Hesdin\nroad, collided at the corner of a street, just as it was entering the\ntown, with a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse, which was going\nin the opposite direction, and in which there was but one person, a man\nenveloped in a mantle. The wheel of the tilbury received quite a\nviolent shock. The postman shouted to the man to stop, but the\ntraveller paid no heed and pursued his road at full gallop.\n\n“That man is in a devilish hurry!” said the postman.\n\nThe man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen struggling\nin convulsions which are certainly deserving of pity.\n\nWhither was he going? He could not have told. Why was he hastening? He\ndid not know. He was driving at random, straight ahead. Whither? To\nArras, no doubt; but he might have been going elsewhere as well. At\ntimes he was conscious of it, and he shuddered. He plunged into the\nnight as into a gulf. Something urged him forward; something drew him\non. No one could have told what was taking place within him; every one\nwill understand it. What man is there who has not entered, at least\nonce in his life, into that obscure cavern of the unknown?\n\nHowever, he had resolved on nothing, decided nothing, formed no plan,\ndone nothing. None of the actions of his conscience had been decisive.\nHe was, more than ever, as he had been at the first moment.\n\nWhy was he going to Arras?\n\nHe repeated what he had already said to himself when he had hired\nScaufflaire’s cabriolet: that, whatever the result was to be, there was\nno reason why he should not see with his own eyes, and judge of matters\nfor himself; that this was even prudent; that he must know what took\nplace; that no decision could be arrived at without having observed and\nscrutinized; that one made mountains out of everything from a distance;\nthat, at any rate, when he should have seen that Champmathieu, some\nwretch, his conscience would probably be greatly relieved to allow him\nto go to the galleys in his stead; that Javert would indeed be there;\nand that Brevet, that Chenildieu, that Cochepaille, old convicts who\nhad known him; but they certainly would not recognize him;—bah! what an\nidea! that Javert was a hundred leagues from suspecting the truth; that\nall conjectures and all suppositions were fixed on Champmathieu, and\nthat there is nothing so headstrong as suppositions and conjectures;\nthat accordingly there was no danger.\n\nThat it was, no doubt, a dark moment, but that he should emerge from\nit; that, after all, he held his destiny, however bad it might be, in\nhis own hand; that he was master of it. He clung to this thought.\n\nAt bottom, to tell the whole truth, he would have preferred not to go\nto Arras.\n\nNevertheless, he was going thither.\n\nAs he meditated, he whipped up his horse, which was proceeding at that\nfine, regular, and even trot which accomplishes two leagues and a half\nan hour.\n\nIn proportion as the cabriolet advanced, he felt something within him\ndraw back.\n\nAt daybreak he was in the open country; the town of M. sur M. lay far\nbehind him. He watched the horizon grow white; he stared at all the\nchilly figures of a winter’s dawn as they passed before his eyes, but\nwithout seeing them. The morning has its spectres as well as the\nevening. He did not see them; but without his being aware of it, and by\nmeans of a sort of penetration which was almost physical, these black\nsilhouettes of trees and of hills added some gloomy and sinister\nquality to the violent state of his soul.\n\nEach time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings which\nsometimes border on the highway, he said to himself, “And yet there are\npeople there within who are sleeping!”\n\n\nThe trot of the horse, the bells on the harness, the wheels on the\nroad, produced a gentle, monotonous noise. These things are charming\nwhen one is joyous, and lugubrious when one is sad.\n\nIt was broad daylight when he arrived at Hesdin. He halted in front of\nthe inn, to allow the horse a breathing spell, and to have him given\nsome oats.\n\nThe horse belonged, as Scaufflaire had said, to that small race of the\nBoulonnais, which has too much head, too much belly, and not enough\nneck and shoulders, but which has a broad chest, a large crupper, thin,\nfine legs, and solid hoofs—a homely, but a robust and healthy race. The\nexcellent beast had travelled five leagues in two hours, and had not a\ndrop of sweat on his loins.\n\nHe did not get out of the tilbury. The stableman who brought the oats\nsuddenly bent down and examined the left wheel.\n\n“Are you going far in this condition?” said the man.\n\nHe replied, with an air of not having roused himself from his reverie:—\n\n“Why?”\n\n\n“Have you come from a great distance?” went on the man.\n\n“Five leagues.”\n\n\n“Ah!”\n\n\n“Why do you say, ‘Ah?’”\n\n\nThe man bent down once more, was silent for a moment, with his eyes\nfixed on the wheel; then he rose erect and said:—\n\n“Because, though this wheel has travelled five leagues, it certainly\nwill not travel another quarter of a league.”\n\n\nHe sprang out of the tilbury.\n\n“What is that you say, my friend?”\n\n\n“I say that it is a miracle that you should have travelled five leagues\nwithout you and your horse rolling into some ditch on the highway. Just\nsee here!”\n\n\nThe wheel really had suffered serious damage. The shock administered by\nthe mail-wagon had split two spokes and strained the hub, so that the\nnut no longer held firm.\n\n“My friend,” he said to the stableman, “is there a wheelwright here?”\n\n\n“Certainly, sir.”\n\n\n“Do me the service to go and fetch him.”\n\n\n“He is only a step from here. Hey! Master Bourgaillard!”\n\n\nMaster Bourgaillard, the wheelwright, was standing on his own\nthreshold. He came, examined the wheel and made a grimace like a\nsurgeon when the latter thinks a limb is broken.\n\n“Can you repair this wheel immediately?”\n\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n\n“When can I set out again?”\n\n\n“To-morrow.”\n\n\n“To-morrow!”\n\n\n“There is a long day’s work on it. Are you in a hurry, sir?”\n\n\n“In a very great hurry. I must set out again in an hour at the latest.”\n\n\n“Impossible, sir.”\n\n\n“I will pay whatever you ask.”\n\n\n“Impossible.”\n\n\n“Well, in two hours, then.”\n\n\n“Impossible to-day. Two new spokes and a hub must be made. Monsieur\nwill not be able to start before to-morrow morning.”\n\n\n“The matter cannot wait until to-morrow. What if you were to replace\nthis wheel instead of repairing it?”\n\n\n“How so?”\n\n\n“You are a wheelwright?”\n\n\n“Certainly, sir.”\n\n\n“Have you not a wheel that you can sell me? Then I could start again at\nonce.”\n\n\n“A spare wheel?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“I have no wheel on hand that would fit your cabriolet. Two wheels make\na pair. Two wheels cannot be put together hap-hazard.”\n\n\n“In that case, sell me a pair of wheels.”\n\n\n“Not all wheels fit all axles, sir.”\n\n\n“Try, nevertheless.”\n\n\n“It is useless, sir. I have nothing to sell but cart-wheels. We are but\na poor country here.”\n\n\n“Have you a cabriolet that you can let me have?”\n\n\nThe wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was a\nhired vehicle. He shrugged his shoulders.\n\n“You treat the cabriolets that people let you so well! If I had one, I\nwould not let it to you!”\n\n\n“Well, sell it to me, then.”\n\n\n“I have none.”\n\n\n“What! not even a spring-cart? I am not hard to please, as you see.”\n\n\n“We live in a poor country. There is, in truth,” added the wheelwright,\n“an old calash under the shed yonder, which belongs to a bourgeois of\nthe town, who gave it to me to take care of, and who only uses it on\nthe thirty-sixth of the month—never, that is to say. I might let that\nto you, for what matters it to me? But the bourgeois must not see it\npass—and then, it is a calash; it would require two horses.”\n\n\n“I will take two post-horses.”\n\n\n“Where is Monsieur going?”\n\n\n“To Arras.”\n\n\n“And Monsieur wishes to reach there to-day?”\n\n\n“Yes, of course.”\n\n\n“By taking two post-horses?”\n\n\n“Why not?”\n\n\n“Does it make any difference whether Monsieur arrives at four o’clock\nto-morrow morning?”\n\n\n“Certainly not.”\n\n\n“There is one thing to be said about that, you see, by taking\npost-horses—Monsieur has his passport?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Well, by taking post-horses, Monsieur cannot reach Arras before\nto-morrow. We are on a crossroad. The relays are badly served, the\nhorses are in the fields. The season for ploughing is just beginning;\nheavy teams are required, and horses are seized upon everywhere, from\nthe post as well as elsewhere. Monsieur will have to wait three or four\nhours at the least at every relay. And, then, they drive at a walk.\nThere are many hills to ascend.”\n\n\n“Come then, I will go on horseback. Unharness the cabriolet. Some one\ncan surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood.”\n\n\n“Without doubt. But will this horse bear the saddle?”\n\n\n“That is true; you remind me of that; he will not bear it.”\n\n\n“Then—”\n\n\n“But I can surely hire a horse in the village?”\n\n\n“A horse to travel to Arras at one stretch?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“That would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts. You\nwould have to buy it to begin with, because no one knows you. But you\nwill not find one for sale nor to let, for five hundred francs, or for\na thousand.”\n\n\n“What am I to do?”\n\n\n“The best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man, and\nset out on your journey to-morrow.”\n\n\n“To-morrow will be too late.”\n\n\n“The deuce!”\n\n\n“Is there not a mail-wagon which runs to Arras? When will it pass?”\n\n\n“To-night. Both the posts pass at night; the one going as well as the\none coming.”\n\n\n“What! It will take you a day to mend this wheel?”\n\n\n“A day, and a good long one.”\n\n\n“If you set two men to work?”\n\n\n“If I set ten men to work.”\n\n\n“What if the spokes were to be tied together with ropes?”\n\n\n“That could be done with the spokes, not with the hub; and the felly is\nin a bad state, too.”\n\n\n“Is there any one in this village who lets out teams?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“Is there another wheelwright?”\n\n\nThe stableman and the wheelwright replied in concert, with a toss of\nthe head.\n\n“No.”\n\n\nHe felt an immense joy.\n\nIt was evident that Providence was intervening. That it was it who had\nbroken the wheel of the tilbury and who was stopping him on the road.\nHe had not yielded to this sort of first summons; he had just made\nevery possible effort to continue the journey; he had loyally and\nscrupulously exhausted all means; he had been deterred neither by the\nseason, nor fatigue, nor by the expense; he had nothing with which to\nreproach himself. If he went no further, that was no fault of his. It\ndid not concern him further. It was no longer his fault. It was not the\nact of his own conscience, but the act of Providence.\n\nHe breathed again. He breathed freely and to the full extent of his\nlungs for the first time since Javert’s visit. It seemed to him that\nthe hand of iron which had held his heart in its grasp for the last\ntwenty hours had just released him.\n\nIt seemed to him that God was for him now, and was manifesting Himself.\n\nHe said to himself that he had done all he could, and that now he had\nnothing to do but retrace his steps quietly.\n\nIf his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber\nof the inn, it would have had no witnesses, no one would have heard\nhim, things would have rested there, and it is probable that we should\nnot have had to relate any of the occurrences which the reader is about\nto peruse; but this conversation had taken place in the street. Any\ncolloquy in the street inevitably attracts a crowd. There are always\npeople who ask nothing better than to become spectators. While he was\nquestioning the wheelwright, some people who were passing back and\nforth halted around them. After listening for a few minutes, a young\nlad, to whom no one had paid any heed, detached himself from the group\nand ran off.\n\nAt the moment when the traveller, after the inward deliberation which\nwe have just described, resolved to retrace his steps, this child\nreturned. He was accompanied by an old woman.\n\n“Monsieur,” said the woman, “my boy tells me that you wish to hire a\ncabriolet.”\n\n\nThese simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made the\nperspiration trickle down his limbs. He thought that he beheld the hand\nwhich had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him, ready\nto seize him once more.\n\nHe answered:—\n\n“Yes, my good woman; I am in search of a cabriolet which I can hire.”\n\n\nAnd he hastened to add:—\n\n“But there is none in the place.”\n\n\n“Certainly there is,” said the old woman.\n\n“Where?” interpolated the wheelwright.\n\n“At my house,” replied the old woman.\n\nHe shuddered. The fatal hand had grasped him again.\n\nThe old woman really had in her shed a sort of basket spring-cart. The\nwheelwright and the stable-man, in despair at the prospect of the\ntraveller escaping their clutches, interfered.\n\n“It was a frightful old trap; it rests flat on the axle; it is an\nactual fact that the seats were suspended inside it by leather thongs;\nthe rain came into it; the wheels were rusted and eaten with moisture;\nit would not go much further than the tilbury; a regular ramshackle old\nstage-wagon; the gentleman would make a great mistake if he trusted\nhimself to it,” etc., etc.\n\nAll this was true; but this trap, this ramshackle old vehicle, this\nthing, whatever it was, ran on its two wheels and could go to Arras.\n\nHe paid what was asked, left the tilbury with the wheelwright to be\nrepaired, intending to reclaim it on his return, had the white horse\nput to the cart, climbed into it, and resumed the road which he had\nbeen travelling since morning.\n\nAt the moment when the cart moved off, he admitted that he had felt, a\nmoment previously, a certain joy in the thought that he should not go\nwhither he was now proceeding. He examined this joy with a sort of\nwrath, and found it absurd. Why should he feel joy at turning back?\nAfter all, he was taking this trip of his own free will. No one was\nforcing him to it.\n\nAnd assuredly nothing would happen except what he should choose.\n\nAs he left Hesdin, he heard a voice shouting to him: “Stop! Stop!” He\nhalted the cart with a vigorous movement which contained a feverish and\nconvulsive element resembling hope.\n\nIt was the old woman’s little boy.\n\n“Monsieur,” said the latter, “it was I who got the cart for you.”\n\n\n“Well?”\n\n\n“You have not given me anything.”\n\n\nHe who gave to all so readily thought this demand exorbitant and almost\nodious.\n\n“Ah! it’s you, you scamp?” said he; “you shall have nothing.”\n\n\nHe whipped up his horse and set off at full speed.\n\nHe had lost a great deal of time at Hesdin. He wanted to make it good.\nThe little horse was courageous, and pulled for two; but it was the\nmonth of February, there had been rain; the roads were bad. And then,\nit was no longer the tilbury. The cart was very heavy, and in addition,\nthere were many ascents.\n\nHe took nearly four hours to go from Hesdin to Saint-Pol; four hours\nfor five leagues.\n\nAt Saint-Pol he had the horse unharnessed at the first inn he came to\nand led to the stable; as he had promised Scaufflaire, he stood beside\nthe manger while the horse was eating; he thought of sad and confusing\nthings.\n\nThe inn-keeper’s wife came to the stable.\n\n“Does not Monsieur wish to breakfast?”\n\n\n“Come, that is true; I even have a good appetite.”\n\n\nHe followed the woman, who had a rosy, cheerful face; she led him to\nthe public room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth.\n\n“Make haste!” said he; “I must start again; I am in a hurry.”\n\n\nA big Flemish servant-maid placed his knife and fork in all haste; he\nlooked at the girl with a sensation of comfort.\n\n“That is what ailed me,” he thought; “I had not breakfasted.”\n\n\nHis breakfast was served; he seized the bread, took a mouthful, and\nthen slowly replaced it on the table, and did not touch it again.\n\nA carter was eating at another table; he said to this man:—\n\n“Why is their bread so bitter here?”\n\n\nThe carter was a German and did not understand him.\n\nHe returned to the stable and remained near the horse.\n\nAn hour later he had quitted Saint-Pol and was directing his course\ntowards Tinques, which is only five leagues from Arras.\n\nWhat did he do during this journey? Of what was he thinking? As in the\nmorning, he watched the trees, the thatched roofs, the tilled fields\npass by, and the way in which the landscape, broken at every turn of\nthe road, vanished; this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes\nsuffices to the soul, and almost relieves it from thought. What is more\nmelancholy and more profound than to see a thousand objects for the\nfirst and the last time? To travel is to be born and to die at every\ninstant; perhaps, in the vaguest region of his mind, he did make\ncomparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence: all\nthe things of life are perpetually fleeing before us; the dark and\nbright intervals are intermingled; after a dazzling moment, an eclipse;\nwe look, we hasten, we stretch out our hands to grasp what is passing;\neach event is a turn in the road, and, all at once, we are old; we feel\na shock; all is black; we distinguish an obscure door; the gloomy horse\nof life, which has been drawing us halts, and we see a veiled and\nunknown person unharnessing amid the shadows.\n\nTwilight was falling when the children who were coming out of school\nbeheld this traveller enter Tinques; it is true that the days were\nstill short; he did not halt at Tinques; as he emerged from the\nvillage, a laborer, who was mending the road with stones, raised his\nhead and said to him:—\n\n“That horse is very much fatigued.”\n\n\nThe poor beast was, in fact, going at a walk.\n\n“Are you going to Arras?” added the road-mender.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“If you go on at that rate you will not arrive very early.”\n\n\nHe stopped his horse, and asked the laborer:—\n\n“How far is it from here to Arras?”\n\n\n“Nearly seven good leagues.”\n\n\n“How is that? the posting guide only says five leagues and a quarter.”\n\n\n“Ah!” returned the road-mender, “so you don’t know that the road is\nunder repair? You will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on;\nthere is no way to proceed further.”\n\n\n“Really?”\n\n\n“You will take the road on the left, leading to Carency; you will cross\nthe river; when you reach Camblin, you will turn to the right; that is\nthe road to Mont-Saint-Éloy which leads to Arras.”\n\n\n“But it is night, and I shall lose my way.”\n\n\n“You do not belong in these parts?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“And, besides, it is all crossroads; stop! sir,” resumed the\nroad-mender; “shall I give you a piece of advice? your horse is tired;\nreturn to Tinques; there is a good inn there; sleep there; you can\nreach Arras to-morrow.”\n\n\n“I must be there this evening.”\n\n\n“That is different; but go to the inn all the same, and get an extra\nhorse; the stable-boy will guide you through the crossroads.”\n\n\nHe followed the road-mender’s advice, retraced his steps, and, half an\nhour later, he passed the same spot again, but this time at full speed,\nwith a good horse to aid; a stable-boy, who called himself a postilion,\nwas seated on the shaft of the cariole.\n\nStill, he felt that he had lost time.\n\nNight had fully come.\n\nThey turned into the crossroad; the way became frightfully bad; the\ncart lurched from one rut to the other; he said to the postilion:—\n\n“Keep at a trot, and you shall have a double fee.”\n\n\nIn one of the jolts, the whiffle-tree broke.\n\n“There’s the whiffle-tree broken, sir,” said the postilion; “I don’t\nknow how to harness my horse now; this road is very bad at night; if\nyou wish to return and sleep at Tinques, we could be in Arras early\nto-morrow morning.”\n\n\nHe replied, “Have you a bit of rope and a knife?”\n\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n\nHe cut a branch from a tree and made a whiffle-tree of it.\n\nThis caused another loss of twenty minutes; but they set out again at a\ngallop.\n\nThe plain was gloomy; low-hanging, black, crisp fogs crept over the\nhills and wrenched themselves away like smoke: there were whitish\ngleams in the clouds; a strong breeze which blew in from the sea\nproduced a sound in all quarters of the horizon, as of some one moving\nfurniture; everything that could be seen assumed attitudes of terror.\nHow many things shiver beneath these vast breaths of the night!\n\nHe was stiff with cold; he had eaten nothing since the night before; he\nvaguely recalled his other nocturnal trip in the vast plain in the\nneighborhood of D——, eight years previously, and it seemed but\nyesterday.\n\nThe hour struck from a distant tower; he asked the boy:—\n\n“What time is it?”\n\n\n“Seven o’clock, sir; we shall reach Arras at eight; we have but three\nleagues still to go.”\n\n\nAt that moment, he for the first time indulged in this reflection,\nthinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner: that\nall this trouble which he was taking was, perhaps, useless; that he did\nnot know so much as the hour of the trial; that he should, at least,\nhave informed himself of that; that he was foolish to go thus straight\nahead without knowing whether he would be of any service or not; then\nhe sketched out some calculations in his mind: that, ordinarily, the\nsittings of the Court of Assizes began at nine o’clock in the morning;\nthat it could not be a long affair; that the theft of the apples would\nbe very brief; that there would then remain only a question of\nidentity, four or five depositions, and very little for the lawyers to\nsay; that he should arrive after all was over.\n\nThe postilion whipped up the horses; they had crossed the river and\nleft Mont-Saint-Éloy behind them.\n\nThe night grew more profound.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—SISTER SIMPLICE PUT TO THE PROOF\n\n\nBut at that moment Fantine was joyous.\n\nShe had passed a very bad night; her cough was frightful; her fever had\ndoubled in intensity; she had had dreams: in the morning, when the\ndoctor paid his visit, she was delirious; he assumed an alarmed look,\nand ordered that he should be informed as soon as M. Madeleine arrived.\n\nAll the morning she was melancholy, said but little, and laid plaits in\nher sheets, murmuring the while, in a low voice, calculations which\nseemed to be calculations of distances. Her eyes were hollow and\nstaring. They seemed almost extinguished at intervals, then lighted up\nagain and shone like stars. It seems as though, at the approach of a\ncertain dark hour, the light of heaven fills those who are quitting the\nlight of earth.\n\nEach time that Sister Simplice asked her how she felt, she replied\ninvariably, “Well. I should like to see M. Madeleine.”\n\n\nSome months before this, at the moment when Fantine had just lost her\nlast modesty, her last shame, and her last joy, she was the shadow of\nherself; now she was the spectre of herself. Physical suffering had\ncompleted the work of moral suffering. This creature of five and twenty\nhad a wrinkled brow, flabby cheeks, pinched nostrils, teeth from which\nthe gums had receded, a leaden complexion, a bony neck, prominent\nshoulder-blades, frail limbs, a clayey skin, and her golden hair was\ngrowing out sprinkled with gray. Alas! how illness improvises old-age!\n\nAt midday the physician returned, gave some directions, inquired\nwhether the mayor had made his appearance at the infirmary, and shook\nhis head.\n\nM. Madeleine usually came to see the invalid at three o’clock. As\nexactness is kindness, he was exact.\n\nAbout half-past two, Fantine began to be restless. In the course of\ntwenty minutes, she asked the nun more than ten times, “What time is\nit, sister?”\n\n\nThree o’clock struck. At the third stroke, Fantine sat up in bed; she\nwho could, in general, hardly turn over, joined her yellow, fleshless\nhands in a sort of convulsive clasp, and the nun heard her utter one of\nthose profound sighs which seem to throw off dejection. Then Fantine\nturned and looked at the door.\n\nNo one entered; the door did not open.\n\nShe remained thus for a quarter of an hour, her eyes riveted on the\ndoor, motionless and apparently holding her breath. The sister dared\nnot speak to her. The clock struck a quarter past three. Fantine fell\nback on her pillow.\n\nShe said nothing, but began to plait the sheets once more.\n\nHalf an hour passed, then an hour, no one came; every time the clock\nstruck, Fantine started up and looked towards the door, then fell back\nagain.\n\nHer thought was clearly perceptible, but she uttered no name, she made\nno complaint, she blamed no one. But she coughed in a melancholy way.\nOne would have said that something dark was descending upon her. She\nwas livid and her lips were blue. She smiled now and then.\n\nFive o’clock struck. Then the sister heard her say, very low and\ngently, “He is wrong not to come to-day, since I am going away\nto-morrow.”\n\n\nSister Simplice herself was surprised at M. Madeleine’s delay.\n\nIn the meantime, Fantine was staring at the tester of her bed. She\nseemed to be endeavoring to recall something. All at once she began to\nsing in a voice as feeble as a breath. The nun listened. This is what\nFantine was singing:—\n\n“Lovely things we will buy\nAs we stroll the faubourgs through.\nRoses are pink, corn-flowers are blue,\nI love my love, corn-flowers are blue.\n\n\n“Yestere’en the Virgin Mary came near my stove, in a broidered mantle\nclad, and said to me, ‘Here, hide ‘neath my veil the child whom you one\nday begged from me. Haste to the city, buy linen, buy a needle, buy\nthread.’\n\n“Lovely things we will buy\nAs we stroll the faubourgs through.\n\n\n“Dear Holy Virgin, beside my stove I have set a cradle with ribbons\ndecked. God may give me his loveliest star; I prefer the child thou\nhast granted me. ‘Madame, what shall I do with this linen fine?’—‘Make\nof it clothes for thy new-born babe.’\n\n“Roses are pink and corn-flowers are blue,\nI love my love, and corn-flowers are blue.\n\n\n“‘Wash this linen.’—‘Where?’—‘In the stream. Make of it, soiling not,\nspoiling not, a petticoat fair with its bodice fine, which I will\nembroider and fill with flowers.’—‘Madame, the child is no longer here;\nwhat is to be done?’—‘Then make of it a winding-sheet in which to bury\nme.’\n\n“Lovely things we will buy\nAs we stroll the faubourgs through,\nRoses are pink, corn-flowers are blue,\nI love my love, corn-flowers are blue.”\n\n\nThis song was an old cradle romance with which she had, in former days,\nlulled her little Cosette to sleep, and which had never recurred to her\nmind in all the five years during which she had been parted from her\nchild. She sang it in so sad a voice, and to so sweet an air, that it\nwas enough to make any one, even a nun, weep. The sister, accustomed as\nshe was to austerities, felt a tear spring to her eyes.\n\nThe clock struck six. Fantine did not seem to hear it. She no longer\nseemed to pay attention to anything about her.\n\nSister Simplice sent a serving-maid to inquire of the portress of the\nfactory, whether the mayor had returned, and if he would not come to\nthe infirmary soon. The girl returned in a few minutes.\n\nFantine was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts.\n\nThe servant informed Sister Simplice in a very low tone, that the mayor\nhad set out that morning before six o’clock, in a little tilbury\nharnessed to a white horse, cold as the weather was; that he had gone\nalone, without even a driver; that no one knew what road he had taken;\nthat people said he had been seen to turn into the road to Arras; that\nothers asserted that they had met him on the road to Paris. That when\nhe went away he had been very gentle, as usual, and that he had merely\ntold the portress not to expect him that night.\n\nWhile the two women were whispering together, with their backs turned\nto Fantine’s bed, the sister interrogating, the servant conjecturing,\nFantine, with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies, which\nunite the free movements of health with the frightful emaciation of\ndeath, had raised herself to her knees in bed, with her shrivelled\nhands resting on the bolster, and her head thrust through the opening\nof the curtains, and was listening. All at once she cried:—\n\n“You are speaking of M. Madeleine! Why are you talking so low? What is\nhe doing? Why does he not come?”\n\n\nHer voice was so abrupt and hoarse that the two women thought they\nheard the voice of a man; they wheeled round in affright.\n\n“Answer me!” cried Fantine.\n\nThe servant stammered:—\n\n“The portress told me that he could not come to-day.”\n\n\n“Be calm, my child,” said the sister; “lie down again.”\n\n\nFantine, without changing her attitude, continued in a loud voice, and\nwith an accent that was both imperious and heart-rending:—\n\n“He cannot come? Why not? You know the reason. You are whispering it to\neach other there. I want to know it.”\n\n\nThe servant-maid hastened to say in the nun’s ear, “Say that he is busy\nwith the city council.”\n\n\nSister Simplice blushed faintly, for it was a lie that the maid had\nproposed to her.\n\nOn the other hand, it seemed to her that the mere communication of the\ntruth to the invalid would, without doubt, deal her a terrible blow,\nand that this was a serious matter in Fantine’s present state. Her\nflush did not last long; the sister raised her calm, sad eyes to\nFantine, and said, “Monsieur le Maire has gone away.”\n\n\nFantine raised herself and crouched on her heels in the bed: her eyes\nsparkled; indescribable joy beamed from that melancholy face.\n\n“Gone!” she cried; “he has gone to get Cosette.”\n\n\nThen she raised her arms to heaven, and her white face became\nineffable; her lips moved; she was praying in a low voice.\n\nWhen her prayer was finished, “Sister,” she said, “I am willing to lie\ndown again; I will do anything you wish; I was naughty just now; I beg\nyour pardon for having spoken so loud; it is very wrong to talk loudly;\nI know that well, my good sister, but, you see, I am very happy: the\ngood God is good; M. Madeleine is good; just think! he has gone to\nMontfermeil to get my little Cosette.”\n\n\nShe lay down again, with the nun’s assistance, helped the nun to\narrange her pillow, and kissed the little silver cross which she wore\non her neck, and which Sister Simplice had given her.\n\n“My child,” said the sister, “try to rest now, and do not talk any\nmore.”\n\n\nFantine took the sister’s hand in her moist hands, and the latter was\npained to feel that perspiration.\n\n“He set out this morning for Paris; in fact, he need not even go\nthrough Paris; Montfermeil is a little to the left as you come thence.\nDo you remember how he said to me yesterday, when I spoke to him of\nCosette, _Soon, soon?_ He wants to give me a surprise, you know! he\nmade me sign a letter so that she could be taken from the Thénardiers;\nthey cannot say anything, can they? they will give back Cosette, for\nthey have been paid; the authorities will not allow them to keep the\nchild since they have received their pay. Do not make signs to me that\nI must not talk, sister! I am extremely happy; I am doing well; I am\nnot ill at all any more; I am going to see Cosette again; I am even\nquite hungry; it is nearly five years since I saw her last; you cannot\nimagine how much attached one gets to children, and then, she will be\nso pretty; you will see! If you only knew what pretty little rosy\nfingers she had! In the first place, she will have very beautiful\nhands; she had ridiculous hands when she was only a year old; like\nthis! she must be a big girl now; she is seven years old; she is quite\na young lady; I call her Cosette, but her name is really Euphrasie.\nStop! this morning I was looking at the dust on the chimney-piece, and\nI had a sort of idea come across me, like that, that I should see\nCosette again soon. Mon Dieu! how wrong it is not to see one’s children\nfor years! One ought to reflect that life is not eternal. Oh, how good\nM. le Maire is to go! it is very cold! it is true; he had on his cloak,\nat least? he will be here to-morrow, will he not? to-morrow will be a\nfestival day; to-morrow morning, sister, you must remind me to put on\nmy little cap that has lace on it. What a place that Montfermeil is! I\ntook that journey on foot once; it was very long for me, but the\ndiligences go very quickly! he will be here to-morrow with Cosette: how\nfar is it from here to Montfermeil?”\n\n\nThe sister, who had no idea of distances, replied, “Oh, I think that he\nwill be here to-morrow.”\n\n\n“To-morrow! to-morrow!” said Fantine, “I shall see Cosette to-morrow!\nyou see, good sister of the good God, that I am no longer ill; I am\nmad; I could dance if any one wished it.”\n\n\nA person who had seen her a quarter of an hour previously would not\nhave understood the change; she was all rosy now; she spoke in a lively\nand natural voice; her whole face was one smile; now and then she\ntalked, she laughed softly; the joy of a mother is almost infantile.\n\n“Well,” resumed the nun, “now that you are happy, mind me, and do not\ntalk any more.”\n\n\nFantine laid her head on her pillow and said in a low voice: “Yes, lie\ndown again; be good, for you are going to have your child; Sister\nSimplice is right; every one here is right.”\n\n\nAnd then, without stirring, without even moving her head, she began to\nstare all about her with wide-open eyes and a joyous air, and she said\nnothing more.\n\nThe sister drew the curtains together again, hoping that she would fall\ninto a doze. Between seven and eight o’clock the doctor came; not\nhearing any sound, he thought Fantine was asleep, entered softly, and\napproached the bed on tiptoe; he opened the curtains a little, and, by\nthe light of the taper, he saw Fantine’s big eyes gazing at him.\n\nShe said to him, “She will be allowed to sleep beside me in a little\nbed, will she not, sir?”\n\n\nThe doctor thought that she was delirious. She added:—\n\n“See! there is just room.”\n\n\nThe doctor took Sister Simplice aside, and she explained matters to\nhim; that M. Madeleine was absent for a day or two, and that in their\ndoubt they had not thought it well to undeceive the invalid, who\nbelieved that the mayor had gone to Montfermeil; that it was possible,\nafter all, that her guess was correct: the doctor approved.\n\nHe returned to Fantine’s bed, and she went on:—\n\n“You see, when she wakes up in the morning, I shall be able to say good\nmorning to her, poor kitten, and when I cannot sleep at night, I can\nhear her asleep; her little gentle breathing will do me good.”\n\n\n“Give me your hand,” said the doctor.\n\nShe stretched out her arm, and exclaimed with a laugh:—\n\n“Ah, hold! in truth, you did not know it; I am cured; Cosette will\narrive to-morrow.”\n\n\nThe doctor was surprised; she was better; the pressure on her chest had\ndecreased; her pulse had regained its strength; a sort of life had\nsuddenly supervened and reanimated this poor, worn-out creature.\n\n“Doctor,” she went on, “did the sister tell you that M. le Maire has\ngone to get that mite of a child?”\n\n\nThe doctor recommended silence, and that all painful emotions should be\navoided; he prescribed an infusion of pure chinchona, and, in case the\nfever should increase again during the night, a calming potion. As he\ntook his departure, he said to the sister:—\n\n“She is doing better; if good luck willed that the mayor should\nactually arrive to-morrow with the child, who knows? there are crises\nso astounding; great joy has been known to arrest maladies; I know well\nthat this is an organic disease, and in an advanced state, but all\nthose things are such mysteries: we may be able to save her.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—THE TRAVELLER ON HIS ARRIVAL TAKES PRECAUTIONS FOR\nDEPARTURE\n\n\nIt was nearly eight o’clock in the evening when the cart, which we left\non the road, entered the porte-cochère of the Hotel de la Poste in\nArras; the man whom we have been following up to this moment alighted\nfrom it, responded with an abstracted air to the attentions of the\npeople of the inn, sent back the extra horse, and with his own hands\nled the little white horse to the stable; then he opened the door of a\nbilliard-room which was situated on the ground floor, sat down there,\nand leaned his elbows on a table; he had taken fourteen hours for the\njourney which he had counted on making in six; he did himself the\njustice to acknowledge that it was not his fault, but at bottom, he was\nnot sorry.\n\nThe landlady of the hotel entered.\n\n“Does Monsieur wish a bed? Does Monsieur require supper?”\n\n\nHe made a sign of the head in the negative.\n\n“The stableman says that Monsieur’s horse is extremely fatigued.”\n\n\nHere he broke his silence.\n\n“Will not the horse be in a condition to set out again to-morrow\nmorning?”\n\n\n“Oh, Monsieur! he must rest for two days at least.”\n\n\nHe inquired:—\n\n“Is not the posting-station located here?”\n\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n\nThe hostess conducted him to the office; he showed his passport, and\ninquired whether there was any way of returning that same night to M.\nsur M. by the mail-wagon; the seat beside the post-boy chanced to be\nvacant; he engaged it and paid for it. “Monsieur,” said the clerk, “do\nnot fail to be here ready to start at precisely one o’clock in the\nmorning.”\n\n\nThis done, he left the hotel and began to wander about the town.\n\nHe was not acquainted with Arras; the streets were dark, and he walked\non at random; but he seemed bent upon not asking the way of the\npassers-by. He crossed the little river Crinchon, and found himself in\na labyrinth of narrow alleys where he lost his way. A citizen was\npassing along with a lantern. After some hesitation, he decided to\napply to this man, not without having first glanced behind and in front\nof him, as though he feared lest some one should hear the question\nwhich he was about to put.\n\n“Monsieur,” said he, “where is the court-house, if you please.”\n\n\n“You do not belong in town, sir?” replied the bourgeois, who was an\noldish man; “well, follow me. I happen to be going in the direction of\nthe court-house, that is to say, in the direction of the hotel of the\nprefecture; for the court-house is undergoing repairs just at this\nmoment, and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in the\nprefecture.”\n\n\n“Is it there that the Assizes are held?” he asked.\n\n“Certainly, sir; you see, the prefecture of to-day was the bishop’s\npalace before the Revolution. M. de Conzié, who was bishop in ’82,\nbuilt a grand hall there. It is in this grand hall that the court is\nheld.”\n\n\nOn the way, the bourgeois said to him:—\n\n“If Monsieur desires to witness a case, it is rather late. The sittings\ngenerally close at six o’clock.”\n\n\nWhen they arrived on the grand square, however, the man pointed out to\nhim four long windows all lighted up, in the front of a vast and gloomy\nbuilding.\n\n“Upon my word, sir, you are in luck; you have arrived in season. Do you\nsee those four windows? That is the Court of Assizes. There is light\nthere, so they are not through. The matter must have been greatly\nprotracted, and they are holding an evening session. Do you take an\ninterest in this affair? Is it a criminal case? Are you a witness?”\n\n\nHe replied:—\n\n“I have not come on any business; I only wish to speak to one of the\nlawyers.”\n\n\n“That is different,” said the bourgeois. “Stop, sir; here is the door\nwhere the sentry stands. You have only to ascend the grand staircase.”\n\n\nHe conformed to the bourgeois’s directions, and a few minutes later he\nwas in a hall containing many people, and where groups, intermingled\nwith lawyers in their gowns, were whispering together here and there.\n\nIt is always a heart-breaking thing to see these congregations of men\nrobed in black, murmuring together in low voices, on the threshold of\nthe halls of justice. It is rare that charity and pity are the outcome\nof these words. Condemnations pronounced in advance are more likely to\nbe the result. All these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful\nobserver so many sombre hives where buzzing spirits construct in\nconcert all sorts of dark edifices.\n\nThis spacious hall, illuminated by a single lamp, was the old hall of\nthe episcopal palace, and served as the large hall of the palace of\njustice. A double-leaved door, which was closed at that moment,\nseparated it from the large apartment where the court was sitting.\n\nThe obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyer\nwhom he met.\n\n“What stage have they reached, sir?” he asked.\n\n“It is finished,” said the lawyer.\n\n“Finished!”\n\n\nThis word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round.\n\n“Excuse me sir; perhaps you are a relative?”\n\n\n“No; I know no one here. Has judgment been pronounced?”\n\n\n“Of course. Nothing else was possible.”\n\n\n“To penal servitude?”\n\n\n“For life.”\n\n\nHe continued, in a voice so weak that it was barely audible:—\n\n“Then his identity was established?”\n\n\n“What identity?” replied the lawyer. “There was no identity to be\nestablished. The matter was very simple. The woman had murdered her\nchild; the infanticide was proved; the jury threw out the question of\npremeditation, and she was condemned for life.”\n\n\n“So it was a woman?” said he.\n\n“Why, certainly. The Limosin woman. Of what are you speaking?”\n\n\n“Nothing. But since it is all over, how comes it that the hall is still\nlighted?”\n\n\n“For another case, which was begun about two hours ago.”\n\n\n“What other case?”\n\n\n“Oh! this one is a clear case also. It is about a sort of blackguard; a\nman arrested for a second offence; a convict who has been guilty of\ntheft. I don’t know his name exactly. There’s a bandit’s phiz for you!\nI’d send him to the galleys on the strength of his face alone.”\n\n\n“Is there any way of getting into the court-room, sir?” said he.\n\n“I really think that there is not. There is a great crowd. However, the\nhearing has been suspended. Some people have gone out, and when the\nhearing is resumed, you might make an effort.”\n\n\n“Where is the entrance?”\n\n\n“Through yonder large door.”\n\n\nThe lawyer left him. In the course of a few moments he had experienced,\nalmost simultaneously, almost intermingled with each other, all\npossible emotions. The words of this indifferent spectator had, in\nturn, pierced his heart like needles of ice and like blades of fire.\nWhen he saw that nothing was settled, he breathed freely once more; but\nhe could not have told whether what he felt was pain or pleasure.\n\nHe drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying. The\ndocket of the session was very heavy; the president had appointed for\nthe same day two short and simple cases. They had begun with the\ninfanticide, and now they had reached the convict, the old offender,\nthe “return horse.” This man had stolen apples, but that did not appear\nto be entirely proved; what had been proved was, that he had already\nbeen in the galleys at Toulon. It was that which lent a bad aspect to\nhis case. However, the man’s examination and the depositions of the\nwitnesses had been completed, but the lawyer’s plea, and the speech of\nthe public prosecutor were still to come; it could not be finished\nbefore midnight. The man would probably be condemned; the\nattorney-general was very clever, and never _missed_ his culprits; he\nwas a brilliant fellow who wrote verses.\n\nAn usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of the Assizes.\nHe inquired of this usher:—\n\n“Will the door be opened soon, sir?”\n\n\n“It will not be opened at all,” replied the usher.\n\n“What! It will not be opened when the hearing is resumed? Is not the\nhearing suspended?”\n\n\n“The hearing has just been begun again,” replied the usher, “but the\ndoor will not be opened again.”\n\n\n“Why?”\n\n\n“Because the hall is full.”\n\n\n“What! There is not room for one more?”\n\n\n“Not another one. The door is closed. No one can enter now.”\n\n\nThe usher added after a pause: “There are, to tell the truth, two or\nthree extra places behind Monsieur le Président, but Monsieur le\nPrésident only admits public functionaries to them.”\n\n\nSo saying, the usher turned his back.\n\nHe retired with bowed head, traversed the antechamber, and slowly\ndescended the stairs, as though hesitating at every step. It is\nprobable that he was holding counsel with himself. The violent conflict\nwhich had been going on within him since the preceding evening was not\nyet ended; and every moment he encountered some new phase of it. On\nreaching the landing-place, he leaned his back against the balusters\nand folded his arms. All at once he opened his coat, drew out his\npocket-book, took from it a pencil, tore out a leaf, and upon that leaf\nhe wrote rapidly, by the light of the street lantern, this line: _M.\nMadeleine, Mayor of M. sur M._; then he ascended the stairs once more\nwith great strides, made his way through the crowd, walked straight up\nto the usher, handed him the paper, and said in an authoritative\nmanner:—\n\n“Take this to Monsieur le Président.”\n\n\nThe usher took the paper, cast a glance upon it, and obeyed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—AN ENTRANCE BY FAVOR\n\n\nAlthough he did not suspect the fact, the mayor of M. sur M. enjoyed a\nsort of celebrity. For the space of seven years his reputation for\nvirtue had filled the whole of Bas Boulonnais; it had eventually passed\nthe confines of a small district and had been spread abroad through two\nor three neighboring departments. Besides the service which he had\nrendered to the chief town by resuscitating the black jet industry,\nthere was not one out of the hundred and forty communes of the\narrondissement of M. sur M. which was not indebted to him for some\nbenefit. He had even at need contrived to aid and multiply the\nindustries of other arrondissements. It was thus that he had, when\noccasion offered, supported with his credit and his funds the linen\nfactory at Boulogne, the flax-spinning industry at Frévent, and the\nhydraulic manufacture of cloth at Boubers-sur-Canche. Everywhere the\nname of M. Madeleine was pronounced with veneration. Arras and Douai\nenvied the happy little town of M. sur M. its mayor.\n\nThe Councillor of the Royal Court of Douai, who was presiding over this\nsession of the Assizes at Arras, was acquainted, in common with the\nrest of the world, with this name which was so profoundly and\nuniversally honored. When the usher, discreetly opening the door which\nconnected the council-chamber with the court-room, bent over the back\nof the President’s armchair and handed him the paper on which was\ninscribed the line which we have just perused, adding: “The gentleman\ndesires to be present at the trial,” the President, with a quick and\ndeferential movement, seized a pen and wrote a few words at the bottom\nof the paper and returned it to the usher, saying, “Admit him.”\n\n\nThe unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near the\ndoor of the hall, in the same place and the same attitude in which the\nusher had left him. In the midst of his reverie he heard some one\nsaying to him, “Will Monsieur do me the honor to follow me?” It was the\nsame usher who had turned his back upon him but a moment previously,\nand who was now bowing to the earth before him. At the same time, the\nusher handed him the paper. He unfolded it, and as he chanced to be\nnear the light, he could read it.\n\n“The President of the Court of Assizes presents his respects to M.\nMadeleine.”\n\n\nHe crushed the paper in his hand as though those words contained for\nhim a strange and bitter aftertaste.\n\nHe followed the usher.\n\nA few minutes later he found himself alone in a sort of wainscoted\ncabinet of severe aspect, lighted by two wax candles, placed upon a\ntable with a green cloth. The last words of the usher who had just\nquitted him still rang in his ears: “Monsieur, you are now in the\ncouncil-chamber; you have only to turn the copper handle of yonder\ndoor, and you will find yourself in the court-room, behind the\nPresident’s chair.” These words were mingled in his thoughts with a\nvague memory of narrow corridors and dark staircases which he had\nrecently traversed.\n\nThe usher had left him alone. The supreme moment had arrived. He sought\nto collect his faculties, but could not. It is chiefly at the moment\nwhen there is the greatest need for attaching them to the painful\nrealities of life, that the threads of thought snap within the brain.\nHe was in the very place where the judges deliberated and condemned.\nWith stupid tranquillity he surveyed this peaceful and terrible\napartment, where so many lives had been broken, which was soon to ring\nwith his name, and which his fate was at that moment traversing. He\nstared at the wall, then he looked at himself, wondering that it should\nbe that chamber and that it should be he.\n\nHe had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours; he was worn out by the\njolts of the cart, but he was not conscious of it. It seemed to him\nthat he felt nothing.\n\nHe approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall, and which\ncontained, under glass, an ancient autograph letter of Jean Nicolas\nPache, mayor of Paris and minister, and dated, through an error, no\ndoubt, the _9th of June_, of the year II., and in which Pache forwarded\nto the commune the list of ministers and deputies held in arrest by\nthem. Any spectator who had chanced to see him at that moment, and who\nhad watched him, would have imagined, doubtless, that this letter\nstruck him as very curious, for he did not take his eyes from it, and\nhe read it two or three times. He read it without paying any attention\nto it, and unconsciously. He was thinking of Fantine and Cosette.\n\nAs he dreamed, he turned round, and his eyes fell upon the brass knob\nof the door which separated him from the Court of Assizes. He had\nalmost forgotten that door. His glance, calm at first, paused there,\nremained fixed on that brass handle, then grew terrified, and little by\nlittle became impregnated with fear. Beads of perspiration burst forth\namong his hair and trickled down upon his temples.\n\nAt a certain moment he made that indescribable gesture of a sort of\nauthority mingled with rebellion, which is intended to convey, and\nwhich does so well convey, _“Pardieu! who compels me to this?”_ Then he\nwheeled briskly round, caught sight of the door through which he had\nentered in front of him, went to it, opened it, and passed out. He was\nno longer in that chamber; he was outside in a corridor, a long, narrow\ncorridor, broken by steps and gratings, making all sorts of angles,\nlighted here and there by lanterns similar to the night taper of\ninvalids, the corridor through which he had approached. He breathed, he\nlistened; not a sound in front, not a sound behind him, and he fled as\nthough pursued.\n\nWhen he had turned many angles in this corridor, he still listened. The\nsame silence reigned, and there was the same darkness around him. He\nwas out of breath; he staggered; he leaned against the wall. The stone\nwas cold; the perspiration lay ice-cold on his brow; he straightened\nhimself up with a shiver.\n\nThen, there alone in the darkness, trembling with cold and with\nsomething else, too, perchance, he meditated.\n\nHe had meditated all night long; he had meditated all the day: he heard\nwithin him but one voice, which said, “Alas!”\n\n\nA quarter of an hour passed thus. At length he bowed his head, sighed\nwith agony, dropped his arms, and retraced his steps. He walked slowly,\nand as though crushed. It seemed as though some one had overtaken him\nin his flight and was leading him back.\n\nHe re-entered the council-chamber. The first thing he caught sight of\nwas the knob of the door. This knob, which was round and of polished\nbrass, shone like a terrible star for him. He gazed at it as a lamb\nmight gaze into the eye of a tiger.\n\nHe could not take his eyes from it. From time to time he advanced a\nstep and approached the door.\n\nHad he listened, he would have heard the sound of the adjoining hall\nlike a sort of confused murmur; but he did not listen, and he did not\nhear.\n\nSuddenly, without himself knowing how it happened, he found himself\nnear the door; he grasped the knob convulsively; the door opened.\n\nHe was in the court-room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—A PLACE WHERE CONVICTIONS ARE IN PROCESS OF FORMATION\n\n\nHe advanced a pace, closed the door mechanically behind him, and\nremained standing, contemplating what he saw.\n\nIt was a vast and badly lighted apartment, now full of uproar, now full\nof silence, where all the apparatus of a criminal case, with its petty\nand mournful gravity in the midst of the throng, was in process of\ndevelopment.\n\nAt the one end of the hall, the one where he was, were judges, with\nabstracted air, in threadbare robes, who were gnawing their nails or\nclosing their eyelids; at the other end, a ragged crowd; lawyers in all\nsorts of attitudes; soldiers with hard but honest faces; ancient,\nspotted woodwork, a dirty ceiling, tables covered with serge that was\nyellow rather than green; doors blackened by handmarks; tap-room lamps\nwhich emitted more smoke than light, suspended from nails in the\nwainscot; on the tables candles in brass candlesticks; darkness,\nugliness, sadness; and from all this there was disengaged an austere\nand august impression, for one there felt that grand human thing which\nis called the law, and that grand divine thing which is called justice.\n\nNo one in all that throng paid any attention to him; all glances were\ndirected towards a single point, a wooden bench placed against a small\ndoor, in the stretch of wall on the President’s left; on this bench,\nilluminated by several candles, sat a man between two gendarmes.\n\nThis man was _the_ man.\n\nHe did not seek him; he saw him; his eyes went thither naturally, as\nthough they had known beforehand where that figure was.\n\nHe thought he was looking at himself, grown old; not absolutely the\nsame in face, of course, but exactly similar in attitude and aspect,\nwith his bristling hair, with that wild and uneasy eye, with that\nblouse, just as it was on the day when he entered D——, full of hatred,\nconcealing his soul in that hideous mass of frightful thoughts which he\nhad spent nineteen years in collecting on the floor of the prison.\n\nHe said to himself with a shudder, “Good God! shall I become like that\nagain?”\n\n\nThis creature seemed to be at least sixty; there was something\nindescribably coarse, stupid, and frightened about him.\n\nAt the sound made by the opening door, people had drawn aside to make\nway for him; the President had turned his head, and, understanding that\nthe personage who had just entered was the mayor of M. sur M., he had\nbowed to him; the attorney-general, who had seen M. Madeleine at M. sur\nM., whither the duties of his office had called him more than once,\nrecognized him and saluted him also: he had hardly perceived it; he was\nthe victim of a sort of hallucination; he was watching.\n\nJudges, clerks, gendarmes, a throng of cruelly curious heads, all these\nhe had already beheld once, in days gone by, twenty-seven years before;\nhe had encountered those fatal things once more; there they were; they\nmoved; they existed; it was no longer an effort of his memory, a mirage\nof his thought; they were real gendarmes and real judges, a real crowd,\nand real men of flesh and blood: it was all over; he beheld the\nmonstrous aspects of his past reappear and live once more around him,\nwith all that there is formidable in reality.\n\nAll this was yawning before him.\n\nHe was horrified by it; he shut his eyes, and exclaimed in the deepest\nrecesses of his soul, “Never!”\n\n\nAnd by a tragic play of destiny which made all his ideas tremble, and\nrendered him nearly mad, it was another self of his that was there! all\ncalled that man who was being tried Jean Valjean.\n\nUnder his very eyes, unheard-of vision, he had a sort of representation\nof the most horrible moment of his life, enacted by his spectre.\n\nEverything was there; the apparatus was the same, the hour of the\nnight, the faces of the judges, of soldiers, and of spectators; all\nwere the same, only above the President’s head there hung a crucifix,\nsomething which the courts had lacked at the time of his condemnation:\nGod had been absent when he had been judged.\n\nThere was a chair behind him; he dropped into it, terrified at the\nthought that he might be seen; when he was seated, he took advantage of\na pile of cardboard boxes, which stood on the judge’s desk, to conceal\nhis face from the whole room; he could now see without being seen; he\nhad fully regained consciousness of the reality of things; gradually he\nrecovered; he attained that phase of composure where it is possible to\nlisten.\n\nM. Bamatabois was one of the jurors.\n\nHe looked for Javert, but did not see him; the seat of the witnesses\nwas hidden from him by the clerk’s table, and then, as we have just\nsaid, the hall was sparely lighted.\n\nAt the moment of this entrance, the defendant’s lawyer had just\nfinished his plea.\n\nThe attention of all was excited to the highest pitch; the affair had\nlasted for three hours: for three hours that crowd had been watching a\nstrange man, a miserable specimen of humanity, either profoundly stupid\nor profoundly subtle, gradually bending beneath the weight of a\nterrible likeness. This man, as the reader already knows, was a\nvagabond who had been found in a field carrying a branch laden with\nripe apples, broken in the orchard of a neighbor, called the Pierron\norchard. Who was this man? an examination had been made; witnesses had\nbeen heard, and they were unanimous; light had abounded throughout the\nentire debate; the accusation said: “We have in our grasp not only a\nmarauder, a stealer of fruit; we have here, in our hands, a bandit, an\nold offender who has broken his ban, an ex-convict, a miscreant of the\nmost dangerous description, a malefactor named Jean Valjean, whom\njustice has long been in search of, and who, eight years ago, on\nemerging from the galleys at Toulon, committed a highway robbery,\naccompanied by violence, on the person of a child, a Savoyard named\nLittle Gervais; a crime provided for by article 383 of the Penal Code,\nthe right to try him for which we reserve hereafter, when his identity\nshall have been judicially established. He has just committed a fresh\ntheft; it is a case of a second offence; condemn him for the fresh\ndeed; later on he will be judged for the old crime.” In the face of\nthis accusation, in the face of the unanimity of the witnesses, the\naccused appeared to be astonished more than anything else; he made\nsigns and gestures which were meant to convey No, or else he stared at\nthe ceiling: he spoke with difficulty, replied with embarrassment, but\nhis whole person, from head to foot, was a denial; he was an idiot in\nthe presence of all these minds ranged in order of battle around him,\nand like a stranger in the midst of this society which was seizing fast\nupon him; nevertheless, it was a question of the most menacing future\nfor him; the likeness increased every moment, and the entire crowd\nsurveyed, with more anxiety than he did himself, that sentence\nfreighted with calamity, which descended ever closer over his head;\nthere was even a glimpse of a possibility afforded; besides the\ngalleys, a possible death penalty, in case his identity were\nestablished, and the affair of Little Gervais were to end thereafter in\ncondemnation. Who was this man? what was the nature of his apathy? was\nit imbecility or craft? Did he understand too well, or did he not\nunderstand at all? these were questions which divided the crowd, and\nseemed to divide the jury; there was something both terrible and\npuzzling in this case: the drama was not only melancholy; it was also\nobscure.\n\nThe counsel for the defence had spoken tolerably well, in that\nprovincial tongue which has long constituted the eloquence of the bar,\nand which was formerly employed by all advocates, at Paris as well as\nat Romorantin or at Montbrison, and which to-day, having become\nclassic, is no longer spoken except by the official orators of\nmagistracy, to whom it is suited on account of its grave sonorousness\nand its majestic stride; a tongue in which a husband is called _a\nconsort_, and a woman _a spouse_; Paris, _the centre of art and\ncivilization_; the king, _the monarch_; Monseigneur the Bishop, _a\nsainted pontiff_; the district-attorney, _the eloquent interpreter of\npublic prosecution_; the arguments, _the accents which we have just\nlistened to_; the age of Louis XIV., _the grand age_; a theatre, _the\ntemple of Melpomene_; the reigning family, _the august blood of our\nkings_; a concert, _a musical solemnity_; the General Commandant of the\nprovince, _the illustrious warrior, who, etc._; the pupils in the\nseminary, _these tender levities_; errors imputed to newspapers, _the\nimposture which distills its venom through the columns of those\norgans_; etc. The lawyer had, accordingly, begun with an explanation as\nto the theft of the apples,—an awkward matter couched in fine style;\nbut Bénigne Bossuet himself was obliged to allude to a chicken in the\nmidst of a funeral oration, and he extricated himself from the\nsituation in stately fashion. The lawyer established the fact that the\ntheft of the apples had not been circumstantially proved. His client,\nwhom he, in his character of counsel, persisted in calling\nChampmathieu, had not been seen scaling that wall nor breaking that\nbranch by any one. He had been taken with that branch (which the lawyer\npreferred to call a _bough_) in his possession; but he said that he had\nfound it broken off and lying on the ground, and had picked it up.\nWhere was there any proof to the contrary? No doubt that branch had\nbeen broken off and concealed after the scaling of the wall, then\nthrown away by the alarmed marauder; there was no doubt that there had\nbeen a thief in the case. But what proof was there that that thief had\nbeen Champmathieu? One thing only. His character as an ex-convict. The\nlawyer did not deny that that character appeared to be, unhappily, well\nattested; the accused had resided at Faverolles; the accused had\nexercised the calling of a tree-pruner there; the name of Champmathieu\nmight well have had its origin in Jean Mathieu; all that was true,—in\nshort, four witnesses recognize Champmathieu, positively and without\nhesitation, as that convict, Jean Valjean; to these signs, to this\ntestimony, the counsel could oppose nothing but the denial of his\nclient, the denial of an interested party; but supposing that he was\nthe convict Jean Valjean, did that prove that he was the thief of the\napples? that was a presumption at the most, not a proof. The prisoner,\nit was true, and his counsel, “in good faith,” was obliged to admit it,\nhad adopted “a bad system of defence.” He obstinately denied\neverything, the theft and his character of convict. An admission upon\nthis last point would certainly have been better, and would have won\nfor him the indulgence of his judges; the counsel had advised him to do\nthis; but the accused had obstinately refused, thinking, no doubt, that\nhe would save everything by admitting nothing. It was an error; but\nought not the paucity of this intelligence to be taken into\nconsideration? This man was visibly stupid. Long-continued wretchedness\nin the galleys, long misery outside the galleys, had brutalized him,\netc. He defended himself badly; was that a reason for condemning him?\nAs for the affair with Little Gervais, the counsel need not discuss it;\nit did not enter into the case. The lawyer wound up by beseeching the\njury and the court, if the identity of Jean Valjean appeared to them to\nbe evident, to apply to him the police penalties which are provided for\na criminal who has broken his ban, and not the frightful chastisement\nwhich descends upon the convict guilty of a second offence.\n\nThe district-attorney answered the counsel for the defence. He was\nviolent and florid, as district-attorneys usually are.\n\nHe congratulated the counsel for the defence on his “loyalty,” and\nskilfully took advantage of this loyalty. He reached the accused\nthrough all the concessions made by his lawyer. The advocate had seemed\nto admit that the prisoner was Jean Valjean. He took note of this. So\nthis man was Jean Valjean. This point had been conceded to the\naccusation and could no longer be disputed. Here, by means of a clever\nautonomasia which went back to the sources and causes of crime, the\ndistrict-attorney thundered against the immorality of the romantic\nschool, then dawning under the name of _the Satanic school_, which had\nbeen bestowed upon it by the critics of the _Quotidienne_ and the\n_Oriflamme_; he attributed, not without some probability, to the\ninfluence of this perverse literature the crime of Champmathieu, or\nrather, to speak more correctly, of Jean Valjean. Having exhausted\nthese considerations, he passed on to Jean Valjean himself. Who was\nthis Jean Valjean? Description of Jean Valjean: a monster spewed forth,\netc. The model for this sort of description is contained in the tale of\nThéramène, which is not useful to tragedy, but which every day renders\ngreat services to judicial eloquence. The audience and the jury\n“shuddered.” The description finished, the district-attorney resumed\nwith an oratorical turn calculated to raise the enthusiasm of the\njournal of the prefecture to the highest pitch on the following day:\nAnd it is such a man, etc., etc., etc., vagabond, beggar, without means\nof existence, etc., etc., inured by his past life to culpable deeds,\nand but little reformed by his sojourn in the galleys, as was proved by\nthe crime committed against Little Gervais, etc., etc.; it is such a\nman, caught upon the highway in the very act of theft, a few paces from\na wall that had been scaled, still holding in his hand the object\nstolen, who denies the crime, the theft, the climbing the wall; denies\neverything; denies even his own identity! In addition to a hundred\nother proofs, to which we will not recur, four witnesses recognize\nhim—Javert, the upright inspector of police; Javert, and three of his\nformer companions in infamy, the convicts Brevet, Chenildieu, and\nCochepaille. What does he offer in opposition to this overwhelming\nunanimity? His denial. What obduracy! You will do justice, gentlemen of\nthe jury, etc., etc. While the district-attorney was speaking, the\naccused listened to him open-mouthed, with a sort of amazement in which\nsome admiration was assuredly blended. He was evidently surprised that\na man could talk like that. From time to time, at those “energetic”\nmoments of the prosecutor’s speech, when eloquence which cannot contain\nitself overflows in a flood of withering epithets and envelops the\naccused like a storm, he moved his head slowly from right to left and\nfrom left to right in the sort of mute and melancholy protest with\nwhich he had contented himself since the beginning of the argument. Two\nor three times the spectators who were nearest to him heard him say in\na low voice, “That is what comes of not having asked M. Baloup.” The\ndistrict-attorney directed the attention of the jury to this stupid\nattitude, evidently deliberate, which denoted not imbecility, but\ncraft, skill, a habit of deceiving justice, and which set forth in all\nits nakedness the “profound perversity” of this man. He ended by making\nhis reserves on the affair of Little Gervais and demanding a severe\nsentence.\n\nAt that time, as the reader will remember, it was penal servitude for\nlife.\n\nThe counsel for the defence rose, began by complimenting Monsieur\nl’Avocat-General on his “admirable speech,” then replied as best he\ncould; but he weakened; the ground was evidently slipping away from\nunder his feet.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X—THE SYSTEM OF DENIALS\n\n\nThe moment for closing the debate had arrived. The President had the\naccused stand up, and addressed to him the customary question, “Have\nyou anything to add to your defence?”\n\n\nThe man did not appear to understand, as he stood there, twisting in\nhis hands a terrible cap which he had.\n\nThe President repeated the question.\n\nThis time the man heard it. He seemed to understand. He made a motion\nlike a man who is just waking up, cast his eyes about him, stared at\nthe audience, the gendarmes, his counsel, the jury, the court, laid his\nmonstrous fist on the rim of woodwork in front of his bench, took\nanother look, and all at once, fixing his glance upon the\ndistrict-attorney, he began to speak. It was like an eruption. It\nseemed, from the manner in which the words escaped from his\nmouth,—incoherent, impetuous, pell-mell, tumbling over each other,—as\nthough they were all pressing forward to issue forth at once. He said:—\n\n“This is what I have to say. That I have been a wheelwright in Paris,\nand that it was with Monsieur Baloup. It is a hard trade. In the\nwheelwright’s trade one works always in the open air, in courtyards,\nunder sheds when the masters are good, never in closed workshops,\nbecause space is required, you see. In winter one gets so cold that one\nbeats one’s arms together to warm one’s self; but the masters don’t\nlike it; they say it wastes time. Handling iron when there is ice\nbetween the paving-stones is hard work. That wears a man out quickly.\nOne is old while he is still quite young in that trade. At forty a man\nis done for. I was fifty-three. I was in a bad state. And then, workmen\nare so mean! When a man is no longer young, they call him nothing but\nan old bird, old beast! I was not earning more than thirty sous a day.\nThey paid me as little as possible. The masters took advantage of my\nage—and then I had my daughter, who was a laundress at the river. She\nearned a little also. It sufficed for us two. She had trouble, also;\nall day long up to her waist in a tub, in rain, in snow. When the wind\ncuts your face, when it freezes, it is all the same; you must still\nwash. There are people who have not much linen, and wait until late; if\nyou do not wash, you lose your custom. The planks are badly joined, and\nwater drops on you from everywhere; you have your petticoats all damp\nabove and below. That penetrates. She has also worked at the laundry of\nthe Enfants-Rouges, where the water comes through faucets. You are not\nin the tub there; you wash at the faucet in front of you, and rinse in\na basin behind you. As it is enclosed, you are not so cold; but there\nis that hot steam, which is terrible, and which ruins your eyes. She\ncame home at seven o’clock in the evening, and went to bed at once, she\nwas so tired. Her husband beat her. She is dead. We have not been very\nhappy. She was a good girl, who did not go to the ball, and who was\nvery peaceable. I remember one Shrove-Tuesday when she went to bed at\neight o’clock. There, I am telling the truth; you have only to ask. Ah,\nyes! how stupid I am! Paris is a gulf. Who knows Father Champmathieu\nthere? But M. Baloup does, I tell you. Go see at M. Baloup’s; and after\nall, I don’t know what is wanted of me.”\n\n\nThe man ceased speaking, and remained standing. He had said these\nthings in a loud, rapid, hoarse voice, with a sort of irritated and\nsavage ingenuousness. Once he paused to salute some one in the crowd.\nThe sort of affirmations which he seemed to fling out before him at\nrandom came like hiccoughs, and to each he added the gesture of a\nwood-cutter who is splitting wood. When he had finished, the audience\nburst into a laugh. He stared at the public, and, perceiving that they\nwere laughing, and not understanding why, he began to laugh himself.\n\nIt was inauspicious.\n\nThe President, an attentive and benevolent man, raised his voice.\n\nHe reminded “the gentlemen of the jury” that “the sieur Baloup,\nformerly a master-wheelwright, with whom the accused stated that he had\nserved, had been summoned in vain. He had become bankrupt, and was not\nto be found.” Then turning to the accused, he enjoined him to listen to\nwhat he was about to say, and added: “You are in a position where\nreflection is necessary. The gravest presumptions rest upon you, and\nmay induce vital results. Prisoner, in your own interests, I summon you\nfor the last time to explain yourself clearly on two points. In the\nfirst place, did you or did you not climb the wall of the Pierron\norchard, break the branch, and steal the apples; that is to say, commit\nthe crime of breaking in and theft? In the second place, are you the\ndischarged convict, Jean Valjean—yes or no?”\n\n\nThe prisoner shook his head with a capable air, like a man who has\nthoroughly understood, and who knows what answer he is going to make.\nHe opened his mouth, turned towards the President, and said:—\n\n“In the first place—”\n\n\nThen he stared at his cap, stared at the ceiling, and held his peace.\n\n“Prisoner,” said the district-attorney, in a severe voice; “pay\nattention. You are not answering anything that has been asked of you.\nYour embarrassment condemns you. It is evident that your name is not\nChampmathieu; that you are the convict, Jean Valjean, concealed first\nunder the name of Jean Mathieu, which was the name of his mother; that\nyou went to Auvergne; that you were born at Faverolles, where you were\na pruner of trees. It is evident that you have been guilty of entering,\nand of the theft of ripe apples from the Pierron orchard. The gentlemen\nof the jury will form their own opinion.”\n\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nFather Champmathieu on Trial\n\n\nThe prisoner had finally resumed his seat; he arose abruptly when the\ndistrict-attorney had finished, and exclaimed:—\n\n“You are very wicked; that you are! This what I wanted to say; I could\nnot find words for it at first. I have stolen nothing. I am a man who\ndoes not have something to eat every day. I was coming from Ailly; I\nwas walking through the country after a shower, which had made the\nwhole country yellow: even the ponds were overflowed, and nothing\nsprang from the sand any more but the little blades of grass at the\nwayside. I found a broken branch with apples on the ground; I picked up\nthe branch without knowing that it would get me into trouble. I have\nbeen in prison, and they have been dragging me about for the last three\nmonths; more than that I cannot say; people talk against me, they tell\nme, ‘Answer!’ The gendarme, who is a good fellow, nudges my elbow, and\nsays to me in a low voice, ‘Come, answer!’ I don’t know how to explain;\nI have no education; I am a poor man; that is where they wrong me,\nbecause they do not see this. I have not stolen; I picked up from the\nground things that were lying there. You say, Jean Valjean, Jean\nMathieu! I don’t know those persons; they are villagers. I worked for\nM. Baloup, Boulevard de l’Hôpital; my name is Champmathieu. You are\nvery clever to tell me where I was born; I don’t know myself: it’s not\neverybody who has a house in which to come into the world; that would\nbe too convenient. I think that my father and mother were people who\nstrolled along the highways; I know nothing different. When I was a\nchild, they called me _young fellow_; now they call me _old Fellow_;\nthose are my baptismal names; take that as you like. I have been in\nAuvergne; I have been at Faverolles. Pardi. Well! can’t a man have been\nin Auvergne, or at Faverolles, without having been in the galleys? I\ntell you that I have not stolen, and that I am Father Champmathieu; I\nhave been with M. Baloup; I have had a settled residence. You worry me\nwith your nonsense, there! Why is everybody pursuing me so furiously?”\n\n\nThe district-attorney had remained standing; he addressed the\nPresident:—\n\n“Monsieur le Président, in view of the confused but exceedingly clever\ndenials of the prisoner, who would like to pass himself off as an\nidiot, but who will not succeed in so doing,—we shall attend to\nthat,—we demand that it shall please you and that it shall please the\ncourt to summon once more into this place the convicts Brevet,\nCochepaille, and Chenildieu, and Police-Inspector Javert, and question\nthem for the last time as to the identity of the prisoner with the\nconvict Jean Valjean.”\n\n\n“I would remind the district-attorney,” said the President, “that\nPolice-Inspector Javert, recalled by his duties to the capital of a\nneighboring arrondissement, left the court-room and the town as soon as\nhe had made his deposition; we have accorded him permission, with the\nconsent of the district-attorney and of the counsel for the prisoner.”\n\n\n“That is true, Mr. President,” responded the district-attorney. “In the\nabsence of sieur Javert, I think it my duty to remind the gentlemen of\nthe jury of what he said here a few hours ago. Javert is an estimable\nman, who does honor by his rigorous and strict probity to inferior but\nimportant functions. These are the terms of his deposition: ‘I do not\neven stand in need of circumstantial proofs and moral presumptions to\ngive the lie to the prisoner’s denial. I recognize him perfectly. The\nname of this man is not Champmathieu; he is an ex-convict named Jean\nValjean, and is very vicious and much to be feared. It is only with\nextreme regret that he was released at the expiration of his term. He\nunderwent nineteen years of penal servitude for theft. He made five or\nsix attempts to escape. Besides the theft from Little Gervais, and from\nthe Pierron orchard, I suspect him of a theft committed in the house of\nHis Grace the late Bishop of D—— I often saw him at the time when I was\nadjutant of the galley-guard at the prison in Toulon. I repeat that I\nrecognize him perfectly.’”\n\n\nThis extremely precise statement appeared to produce a vivid impression\non the public and on the jury. The district-attorney concluded by\ninsisting, that in default of Javert, the three witnesses Brevet,\nChenildieu, and Cochepaille should be heard once more and solemnly\ninterrogated.\n\nThe President transmitted the order to an usher, and, a moment later,\nthe door of the witnesses’ room opened. The usher, accompanied by a\ngendarme ready to lend him armed assistance, introduced the convict\nBrevet. The audience was in suspense; and all breasts heaved as though\nthey had contained but one soul.\n\nThe ex-convict Brevet wore the black and gray waistcoat of the central\nprisons. Brevet was a person sixty years of age, who had a sort of\nbusiness man’s face, and the air of a rascal. The two sometimes go\ntogether. In prison, whither fresh misdeeds had led him, he had become\nsomething in the nature of a turnkey. He was a man of whom his\nsuperiors said, “He tries to make himself of use.” The chaplains bore\ngood testimony as to his religious habits. It must not be forgotten\nthat this passed under the Restoration.\n\n“Brevet,” said the President, “you have undergone an ignominious\nsentence, and you cannot take an oath.”\n\n\nBrevet dropped his eyes.\n\n“Nevertheless,” continued the President, “even in the man whom the law\nhas degraded, there may remain, when the divine mercy permits it, a\nsentiment of honor and of equity. It is to this sentiment that I appeal\nat this decisive hour. If it still exists in you,—and I hope it\ndoes,—reflect before replying to me: consider on the one hand, this\nman, whom a word from you may ruin; on the other hand, justice, which a\nword from you may enlighten. The instant is solemn; there is still time\nto retract if you think you have been mistaken. Rise, prisoner. Brevet,\ntake a good look at the accused, recall your souvenirs, and tell us on\nyour soul and conscience, if you persist in recognizing this man as\nyour former companion in the galleys, Jean Valjean?”\n\n\nBrevet looked at the prisoner, then turned towards the court.\n\n“Yes, Mr. President, I was the first to recognize him, and I stick to\nit; that man is Jean Valjean, who entered at Toulon in 1796, and left\nin 1815. I left a year later. He has the air of a brute now; but it\nmust be because age has brutalized him; he was sly at the galleys: I\nrecognize him positively.”\n\n\n“Take your seat,” said the President. “Prisoner, remain standing.”\n\n\nChenildieu was brought in, a prisoner for life, as was indicated by his\nred cassock and his green cap. He was serving out his sentence at the\ngalleys of Toulon, whence he had been brought for this case. He was a\nsmall man of about fifty, brisk, wrinkled, frail, yellow, brazen-faced,\nfeverish, who had a sort of sickly feebleness about all his limbs and\nhis whole person, and an immense force in his glance. His companions in\nthe galleys had nicknamed him _I-deny-God_ (_Je-nie Dieu_, Chenildieu).\n\nThe President addressed him in nearly the same words which he had used\nto Brevet. At the moment when he reminded him of his infamy which\ndeprived him of the right to take an oath, Chenildieu raised his head\nand looked the crowd in the face. The President invited him to\nreflection, and asked him as he had asked Brevet, if he persisted in\nrecognition of the prisoner.\n\nChenildieu burst out laughing.\n\n“Pardieu, as if I didn’t recognize him! We were attached to the same\nchain for five years. So you are sulking, old fellow?”\n\n\n“Go take your seat,” said the President.\n\nThe usher brought in Cochepaille. He was another convict for life, who\nhad come from the galleys, and was dressed in red, like Chenildieu, was\na peasant from Lourdes, and a half-bear of the Pyrenees. He had guarded\nthe flocks among the mountains, and from a shepherd he had slipped into\na brigand. Cochepaille was no less savage and seemed even more stupid\nthan the prisoner. He was one of those wretched men whom nature has\nsketched out for wild beasts, and on whom society puts the finishing\ntouches as convicts in the galleys.\n\nThe President tried to touch him with some grave and pathetic words,\nand asked him, as he had asked the other two, if he persisted, without\nhesitation or trouble, in recognizing the man who was standing before\nhim.\n\n“He is Jean Valjean,” said Cochepaille. “He was even called\nJean-the-Screw, because he was so strong.”\n\n\nEach of these affirmations from these three men, evidently sincere and\nin good faith, had raised in the audience a murmur of bad augury for\nthe prisoner,—a murmur which increased and lasted longer each time that\na fresh declaration was added to the proceeding.\n\nThe prisoner had listened to them, with that astounded face which was,\naccording to the accusation, his principal means of defence; at the\nfirst, the gendarmes, his neighbors, had heard him mutter between his\nteeth: “Ah, well, he’s a nice one!” after the second, he said, a little\nlouder, with an air that was almost that of satisfaction, “Good!” at\nthe third, he cried, “Famous!”\n\n\nThe President addressed him:—\n\n“Have you heard, prisoner? What have you to say?”\n\n\nHe replied:—\n\n“I say, ‘Famous!’”\n\n\nAn uproar broke out among the audience, and was communicated to the\njury; it was evident that the man was lost.\n\n“Ushers,” said the President, “enforce silence! I am going to sum up\nthe arguments.”\n\n\nAt that moment there was a movement just beside the President; a voice\nwas heard crying:—\n\n“Brevet! Chenildieu! Cochepaille! look here!”\n\n\nAll who heard that voice were chilled, so lamentable and terrible was\nit; all eyes were turned to the point whence it had proceeded. A man,\nplaced among the privileged spectators who were seated behind the\ncourt, had just risen, had pushed open the half-door which separated\nthe tribunal from the audience, and was standing in the middle of the\nhall; the President, the district-attorney, M. Bamatabois, twenty\npersons, recognized him, and exclaimed in concert:—\n\n“M. Madeleine!”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI—CHAMPMATHIEU MORE AND MORE ASTONISHED\n\n\nIt was he, in fact. The clerk’s lamp illumined his countenance. He held\nhis hat in his hand; there was no disorder in his clothing; his coat\nwas carefully buttoned; he was very pale, and he trembled slightly; his\nhair, which had still been gray on his arrival in Arras, was now\nentirely white: it had turned white during the hour he had sat there.\n\nAll heads were raised: the sensation was indescribable; there was a\nmomentary hesitation in the audience, the voice had been so\nheart-rending; the man who stood there appeared so calm that they did\nnot understand at first. They asked themselves whether he had indeed\nuttered that cry; they could not believe that that tranquil man had\nbeen the one to give that terrible outcry.\n\nThis indecision only lasted a few seconds. Even before the President\nand the district-attorney could utter a word, before the ushers and the\ngendarmes could make a gesture, the man whom all still called, at that\nmoment, M. Madeleine, had advanced towards the witnesses Cochepaille,\nBrevet, and Chenildieu.\n\n“Do you not recognize me?” said he.\n\nAll three remained speechless, and indicated by a sign of the head that\nthey did not know him. Cochepaille, who was intimidated, made a\nmilitary salute. M. Madeleine turned towards the jury and the court,\nand said in a gentle voice:—\n\n“Gentlemen of the jury, order the prisoner to be released! Mr.\nPresident, have me arrested. He is not the man whom you are in search\nof; it is I: I am Jean Valjean.”\n\n\nNot a mouth breathed; the first commotion of astonishment had been\nfollowed by a silence like that of the grave; those within the hall\nexperienced that sort of religious terror which seizes the masses when\nsomething grand has been done.\n\nIn the meantime, the face of the President was stamped with sympathy\nand sadness; he had exchanged a rapid sign with the district-attorney\nand a few low-toned words with the assistant judges; he addressed the\npublic, and asked in accents which all understood:—\n\n“Is there a physician present?”\n\n\nThe district-attorney took the word:—\n\n“Gentlemen of the jury, the very strange and unexpected incident which\ndisturbs the audience inspires us, like yourselves, only with a\nsentiment which it is unnecessary for us to express. You all know, by\nreputation at least, the honorable M. Madeleine, mayor of M. sur M.; if\nthere is a physician in the audience, we join the President in\nrequesting him to attend to M. Madeleine, and to conduct him to his\nhome.”\n\n\nM. Madeleine did not allow the district-attorney to finish; he\ninterrupted him in accents full of suavity and authority. These are the\nwords which he uttered; here they are literally, as they were written\ndown, immediately after the trial by one of the witnesses to this\nscene, and as they now ring in the ears of those who heard them nearly\nforty years ago:—\n\n“I thank you, Mr. District-Attorney, but I am not mad; you shall see;\nyou were on the point of committing a great error; release this man! I\nam fulfilling a duty; I am that miserable criminal. I am the only one\nhere who sees the matter clearly, and I am telling you the truth. God,\nwho is on high, looks down on what I am doing at this moment, and that\nsuffices. You can take me, for here I am: but I have done my best; I\nconcealed myself under another name; I have become rich; I have become\na mayor; I have tried to re-enter the ranks of the honest. It seems\nthat that is not to be done. In short, there are many things which I\ncannot tell. I will not narrate the story of my life to you; you will\nhear it one of these days. I robbed Monseigneur the Bishop, it is true;\nit is true that I robbed Little Gervais; they were right in telling you\nthat Jean Valjean was a very vicious wretch. Perhaps it was not\naltogether his fault. Listen, honorable judges! a man who has been so\ngreatly humbled as I have has neither any remonstrances to make to\nProvidence, nor any advice to give to society; but, you see, the infamy\nfrom which I have tried to escape is an injurious thing; the galleys\nmake the convict what he is; reflect upon that, if you please. Before\ngoing to the galleys, I was a poor peasant, with very little\nintelligence, a sort of idiot; the galleys wrought a change in me. I\nwas stupid; I became vicious: I was a block of wood; I became a\nfirebrand. Later on, indulgence and kindness saved me, as severity had\nruined me. But, pardon me, you cannot understand what I am saying. You\nwill find at my house, among the ashes in the fireplace, the forty-sou\npiece which I stole, seven years ago, from Little Gervais. I have\nnothing farther to add; take me. Good God! the district-attorney shakes\nhis head; you say, ‘M. Madeleine has gone mad!’ you do not believe me!\nthat is distressing. Do not, at least, condemn this man! What! these\nmen do not recognize me! I wish Javert were here; he would recognize\nme.”\n\n\nNothing can reproduce the sombre and kindly melancholy of tone which\naccompanied these words.\n\nHe turned to the three convicts, and said:—\n\n“Well, I recognize you; do you remember, Brevet?”\n\n\nHe paused, hesitated for an instant, and said:—\n\n“Do you remember the knitted suspenders with a checked pattern which\nyou wore in the galleys?”\n\n\nBrevet gave a start of surprise, and surveyed him from head to foot\nwith a frightened air. He continued:—\n\n“Chenildieu, you who conferred on yourself the name of ‘Jenie-Dieu,’\nyour whole right shoulder bears a deep burn, because you one day laid\nyour shoulder against the chafing-dish full of coals, in order to\nefface the three letters T. F. P., which are still visible,\nnevertheless; answer, is this true?”\n\n\n“It is true,” said Chenildieu.\n\nHe addressed himself to Cochepaille:—\n\n“Cochepaille, you have, near the bend in your left arm, a date stamped\nin blue letters with burnt powder; the date is that of the landing of\nthe Emperor at Cannes, March 1, 1815; pull up your sleeve!”\n\n\nCochepaille pushed up his sleeve; all eyes were focused on him and on\nhis bare arm.\n\nA gendarme held a light close to it; there was the date.\n\nThe unhappy man turned to the spectators and the judges with a smile\nwhich still rends the hearts of all who saw it whenever they think of\nit. It was a smile of triumph; it was also a smile of despair.\n\n“You see plainly,” he said, “that I am Jean Valjean.”\n\n\nIn that chamber there were no longer either judges, accusers, nor\ngendarmes; there was nothing but staring eyes and sympathizing hearts.\nNo one recalled any longer the part that each might be called upon to\nplay; the district-attorney forgot he was there for the purpose of\nprosecuting, the President that he was there to preside, the counsel\nfor the defence that he was there to defend. It was a striking\ncircumstance that no question was put, that no authority intervened.\nThe peculiarity of sublime spectacles is, that they capture all souls\nand turn witnesses into spectators. No one, probably, could have\nexplained what he felt; no one, probably, said to himself that he was\nwitnessing the splendid outburst of a grand light: all felt themselves\ninwardly dazzled.\n\nIt was evident that they had Jean Valjean before their eyes. That was\nclear. The appearance of this man had sufficed to suffuse with light\nthat matter which had been so obscure but a moment previously, without\nany further explanation: the whole crowd, as by a sort of electric\nrevelation, understood instantly and at a single glance the simple and\nmagnificent history of a man who was delivering himself up so that\nanother man might not be condemned in his stead. The details, the\nhesitations, little possible oppositions, were swallowed up in that\nvast and luminous fact.\n\nIt was an impression which vanished speedily, but which was\nirresistible at the moment.\n\n“I do not wish to disturb the court further,” resumed Jean Valjean. “I\nshall withdraw, since you do not arrest me. I have many things to do.\nThe district-attorney knows who I am; he knows whither I am going; he\ncan have me arrested when he likes.”\n\n\nHe directed his steps towards the door. Not a voice was raised, not an\narm extended to hinder him. All stood aside. At that moment there was\nabout him that divine something which causes multitudes to stand aside\nand make way for a man. He traversed the crowd slowly. It was never\nknown who opened the door, but it is certain that he found the door\nopen when he reached it. On arriving there he turned round and said:—\n\n“I am at your command, Mr. District-Attorney.”\n\n\nThen he addressed the audience:—\n\n“All of you, all who are present—consider me worthy of pity, do you\nnot? Good God! When I think of what I was on the point of doing, I\nconsider that I am to be envied. Nevertheless, I should have preferred\nnot to have had this occur.”\n\n\nHe withdrew, and the door closed behind him as it had opened, for those\nwho do certain sovereign things are always sure of being served by some\none in the crowd.\n\nLess than an hour after this, the verdict of the jury freed the said\nChampmathieu from all accusations; and Champmathieu, being at once\nreleased, went off in a state of stupefaction, thinking that all men\nwere fools, and comprehending nothing of this vision.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHTH—A COUNTER-BLOW\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—IN WHAT MIRROR M. MADELEINE CONTEMPLATES HIS HAIR\n\n\nThe day had begun to dawn. Fantine had passed a sleepless and feverish\nnight, filled with happy visions; at daybreak she fell asleep. Sister\nSimplice, who had been watching with her, availed herself of this\nslumber to go and prepare a new potion of chinchona. The worthy sister\nhad been in the laboratory of the infirmary but a few moments, bending\nover her drugs and phials, and scrutinizing things very closely, on\naccount of the dimness which the half-light of dawn spreads over all\nobjects. Suddenly she raised her head and uttered a faint shriek. M.\nMadeleine stood before her; he had just entered silently.\n\n“Is it you, Mr. Mayor?” she exclaimed.\n\nHe replied in a low voice:—\n\n“How is that poor woman?”\n\n\n“Not so bad just now; but we have been very uneasy.”\n\n\nShe explained to him what had passed: that Fantine had been very ill\nthe day before, and that she was better now, because she thought that\nthe mayor had gone to Montfermeil to get her child. The sister dared\nnot question the mayor; but she perceived plainly from his air that he\nhad not come from there.\n\n“All that is good,” said he; “you were right not to undeceive her.”\n\n\n“Yes,” responded the sister; “but now, Mr. Mayor, she will see you and\nwill not see her child. What shall we say to her?”\n\n\nHe reflected for a moment.\n\n“God will inspire us,” said he.\n\n“But we cannot tell a lie,” murmured the sister, half aloud.\n\nIt was broad daylight in the room. The light fell full on M.\nMadeleine’s face. The sister chanced to raise her eyes to it.\n\n“Good God, sir!” she exclaimed; “what has happened to you? Your hair is\nperfectly white!”\n\n\n“White!” said he.\n\nSister Simplice had no mirror. She rummaged in a drawer, and pulled out\nthe little glass which the doctor of the infirmary used to see whether\na patient was dead and whether he no longer breathed. M. Madeleine took\nthe mirror, looked at his hair, and said:—\n\n“Well!”\n\n\nHe uttered the word indifferently, and as though his mind were on\nsomething else.\n\nThe sister felt chilled by something strange of which she caught a\nglimpse in all this.\n\nHe inquired:—\n\n“Can I see her?”\n\n\n“Is not Monsieur le Maire going to have her child brought back to her?”\nsaid the sister, hardly venturing to put the question.\n\n“Of course; but it will take two or three days at least.”\n\n\n“If she were not to see Monsieur le Maire until that time,” went on the\nsister, timidly, “she would not know that Monsieur le Maire had\nreturned, and it would be easy to inspire her with patience; and when\nthe child arrived, she would naturally think Monsieur le Maire had just\ncome with the child. We should not have to enact a lie.”\n\n\nM. Madeleine seemed to reflect for a few moments; then he said with his\ncalm gravity:—\n\n“No, sister, I must see her. I may, perhaps, be in haste.”\n\n\nThe nun did not appear to notice this word “perhaps,” which\ncommunicated an obscure and singular sense to the words of the mayor’s\nspeech. She replied, lowering her eyes and her voice respectfully:—\n\n“In that case, she is asleep; but Monsieur le Maire may enter.”\n\n\nHe made some remarks about a door which shut badly, and the noise of\nwhich might awaken the sick woman; then he entered Fantine’s chamber,\napproached the bed and drew aside the curtains. She was asleep. Her\nbreath issued from her breast with that tragic sound which is peculiar\nto those maladies, and which breaks the hearts of mothers when they are\nwatching through the night beside their sleeping child who is condemned\nto death. But this painful respiration hardly troubled a sort of\nineffable serenity which overspread her countenance, and which\ntransfigured her in her sleep. Her pallor had become whiteness; her\ncheeks were crimson; her long golden lashes, the only beauty of her\nyouth and her virginity which remained to her, palpitated, though they\nremained closed and drooping. Her whole person was trembling with an\nindescribable unfolding of wings, all ready to open wide and bear her\naway, which could be felt as they rustled, though they could not be\nseen. To see her thus, one would never have dreamed that she was an\ninvalid whose life was almost despaired of. She resembled rather\nsomething on the point of soaring away than something on the point of\ndying.\n\nThe branch trembles when a hand approaches it to pluck a flower, and\nseems to both withdraw and to offer itself at one and the same time.\nThe human body has something of this tremor when the instant arrives in\nwhich the mysterious fingers of Death are about to pluck the soul.\n\nM. Madeleine remained for some time motionless beside that bed, gazing\nin turn upon the sick woman and the crucifix, as he had done two months\nbefore, on the day when he had come for the first time to see her in\nthat asylum. They were both still there in the same attitude—she\nsleeping, he praying; only now, after the lapse of two months, her hair\nwas gray and his was white.\n\nThe sister had not entered with him. He stood beside the bed, with his\nfinger on his lips, as though there were some one in the chamber whom\nhe must enjoin to silence.\n\nShe opened her eyes, saw him, and said quietly, with a smile:—\n\n“And Cosette?”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—FANTINE HAPPY\n\n\nShe made no movement of either surprise or of joy; she was joy itself.\nThat simple question, “And Cosette?” was put with so profound a faith,\nwith so much certainty, with such a complete absence of disquiet and of\ndoubt, that he found not a word of reply. She continued:—\n\n“I knew that you were there. I was asleep, but I saw you. I have seen\nyou for a long, long time. I have been following you with my eyes all\nnight long. You were in a glory, and you had around you all sorts of\ncelestial forms.”\n\n\nHe raised his glance to the crucifix.\n\n“But,” she resumed, “tell me where Cosette is. Why did not you place\nher on my bed against the moment of my waking?”\n\n\nHe made some mechanical reply which he was never afterwards able to\nrecall.\n\nFortunately, the doctor had been warned, and he now made his\nappearance. He came to the aid of M. Madeleine.\n\n“Calm yourself, my child,” said the doctor; “your child is here.”\n\n\nFantine’s eyes beamed and filled her whole face with light. She clasped\nher hands with an expression which contained all that is possible to\nprayer in the way of violence and tenderness.\n\n“Oh!” she exclaimed, “bring her to me!”\n\n\nTouching illusion of a mother! Cosette was, for her, still the little\nchild who is carried.\n\n“Not yet,” said the doctor, “not just now. You still have some fever.\nThe sight of your child would agitate you and do you harm. You must be\ncured first.”\n\n\nShe interrupted him impetuously:—\n\n“But I am cured! Oh, I tell you that I am cured! What an ass that\ndoctor is! The idea! I want to see my child!”\n\n\n“You see,” said the doctor, “how excited you become. So long as you are\nin this state I shall oppose your having your child. It is not enough\nto see her; it is necessary that you should live for her. When you are\nreasonable, I will bring her to you myself.”\n\n\nThe poor mother bowed her head.\n\n“I beg your pardon, doctor, I really beg your pardon. Formerly I should\nnever have spoken as I have just done; so many misfortunes have\nhappened to me, that I sometimes do not know what I am saying. I\nunderstand you; you fear the emotion. I will wait as long as you like,\nbut I swear to you that it would not have harmed me to see my daughter.\nI have been seeing her; I have not taken my eyes from her since\nyesterday evening. Do you know? If she were brought to me now, I should\ntalk to her very gently. That is all. Is it not quite natural that I\nshould desire to see my daughter, who has been brought to me expressly\nfrom Montfermeil? I am not angry. I know well that I am about to be\nhappy. All night long I have seen white things, and persons who smiled\nat me. When Monsieur le Docteur pleases, he shall bring me Cosette. I\nhave no longer any fever; I am well. I am perfectly conscious that\nthere is nothing the matter with me any more; but I am going to behave\nas though I were ill, and not stir, to please these ladies here. When\nit is seen that I am very calm, they will say, ‘She must have her\nchild.’”\n\n\nM. Madeleine was sitting on a chair beside the bed. She turned towards\nhim; she was making a visible effort to be calm and “very good,” as she\nexpressed it in the feebleness of illness which resembles infancy, in\norder that, seeing her so peaceable, they might make no difficulty\nabout bringing Cosette to her. But while she controlled herself she\ncould not refrain from questioning M. Madeleine.\n\n“Did you have a pleasant trip, Monsieur le Maire? Oh! how good you were\nto go and get her for me! Only tell me how she is. Did she stand the\njourney well? Alas! she will not recognize me. She must have forgotten\nme by this time, poor darling! Children have no memories. They are like\nbirds. A child sees one thing to-day and another thing to-morrow, and\nthinks of nothing any longer. And did she have white linen? Did those\nThénardiers keep her clean? How have they fed her? Oh! if you only knew\nhow I have suffered, putting such questions as that to myself during\nall the time of my wretchedness. Now, it is all past. I am happy. Oh,\nhow I should like to see her! Do you think her pretty, Monsieur le\nMaire? Is not my daughter beautiful? You must have been very cold in\nthat diligence! Could she not be brought for just one little instant?\nShe might be taken away directly afterwards. Tell me; you are the\nmaster; it could be so if you chose!”\n\n\nHe took her hand. “Cosette is beautiful,” he said, “Cosette is well.\nYou shall see her soon; but calm yourself; you are talking with too\nmuch vivacity, and you are throwing your arms out from under the\nclothes, and that makes you cough.”\n\n\nIn fact, fits of coughing interrupted Fantine at nearly every word.\n\nFantine did not murmur; she feared that she had injured by her too\npassionate lamentations the confidence which she was desirous of\ninspiring, and she began to talk of indifferent things.\n\n“Montfermeil is quite pretty, is it not? People go there on pleasure\nparties in summer. Are the Thénardiers prosperous? There are not many\ntravellers in their parts. That inn of theirs is a sort of a\ncook-shop.”\n\n\nM. Madeleine was still holding her hand, and gazing at her with\nanxiety; it was evident that he had come to tell her things before\nwhich his mind now hesitated. The doctor, having finished his visit,\nretired. Sister Simplice remained alone with them.\n\nBut in the midst of this pause Fantine exclaimed:—\n\n“I hear her! mon Dieu, I hear her!”\n\n\nShe stretched out her arm to enjoin silence about her, held her breath,\nand began to listen with rapture.\n\nThere was a child playing in the yard—the child of the portress or of\nsome work-woman. It was one of those accidents which are always\noccurring, and which seem to form a part of the mysterious\nstage-setting of mournful scenes. The child—a little girl—was going and\ncoming, running to warm herself, laughing, singing at the top of her\nvoice. Alas! in what are the plays of children not intermingled. It was\nthis little girl whom Fantine heard singing.\n\n“Oh!” she resumed, “it is my Cosette! I recognize her voice.”\n\n\nThe child retreated as it had come; the voice died away. Fantine\nlistened for a while longer, then her face clouded over, and M.\nMadeleine heard her say, in a low voice: “How wicked that doctor is not\nto allow me to see my daughter! That man has an evil countenance, that\nhe has.”\n\n\nBut the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again. She\ncontinued to talk to herself, with her head resting on the pillow: “How\nhappy we are going to be! We shall have a little garden the very first\nthing; M. Madeleine has promised it to me. My daughter will play in the\ngarden. She must know her letters by this time. I will make her spell.\nShe will run over the grass after butterflies. I will watch her. Then\nshe will take her first communion. Ah! when will she take her first\ncommunion?”\n\n\nShe began to reckon on her fingers.\n\n“One, two, three, four—she is seven years old. In five years she will\nhave a white veil, and openwork stockings; she will look like a little\nwoman. O my good sister, you do not know how foolish I become when I\nthink of my daughter’s first communion!”\n\n\nShe began to laugh.\n\nHe had released Fantine’s hand. He listened to her words as one listens\nto the sighing of the breeze, with his eyes on the ground, his mind\nabsorbed in reflection which had no bottom. All at once she ceased\nspeaking, and this caused him to raise his head mechanically. Fantine\nhad become terrible.\n\nShe no longer spoke, she no longer breathed; she had raised herself to\na sitting posture, her thin shoulder emerged from her chemise; her\nface, which had been radiant but a moment before, was ghastly, and she\nseemed to have fixed her eyes, rendered large with terror, on something\nalarming at the other extremity of the room.\n\n“Good God!” he exclaimed; “what ails you, Fantine?”\n\n\nShe made no reply; she did not remove her eyes from the object which\nshe seemed to see. She removed one hand from his arm, and with the\nother made him a sign to look behind him.\n\nHe turned, and beheld Javert.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—JAVERT SATISFIED\n\n\nThis is what had taken place.\n\nThe half-hour after midnight had just struck when M. Madeleine quitted\nthe Hall of Assizes in Arras. He regained his inn just in time to set\nout again by the mail-wagon, in which he had engaged his place. A\nlittle before six o’clock in the morning he had arrived at M. sur M.,\nand his first care had been to post a letter to M. Laffitte, then to\nenter the infirmary and see Fantine.\n\nHowever, he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the Court of\nAssizes, when the district-attorney, recovering from his first shock,\nhad taken the word to deplore the mad deed of the honorable mayor of M.\nsur M., to declare that his convictions had not been in the least\nmodified by that curious incident, which would be explained thereafter,\nand to demand, in the meantime, the condemnation of that Champmathieu,\nwho was evidently the real Jean Valjean. The district-attorney’s\npersistence was visibly at variance with the sentiments of every one,\nof the public, of the court, and of the jury. The counsel for the\ndefence had some difficulty in refuting this harangue and in\nestablishing that, in consequence of the revelations of M. Madeleine,\nthat is to say, of the real Jean Valjean, the aspect of the matter had\nbeen thoroughly altered, and that the jury had before their eyes now\nonly an innocent man. Thence the lawyer had drawn some epiphonemas, not\nvery fresh, unfortunately, upon judicial errors, etc., etc.; the\nPresident, in his summing up, had joined the counsel for the defence,\nand in a few minutes the jury had thrown Champmathieu out of the case.\n\nNevertheless, the district-attorney was bent on having a Jean Valjean;\nand as he had no longer Champmathieu, he took Madeleine.\n\nImmediately after Champmathieu had been set at liberty, the\ndistrict-attorney shut himself up with the President. They conferred\n“as to the necessity of seizing the person of M. le Maire of M. sur M.”\nThis phrase, in which there was a great deal of _of_, is the\ndistrict-attorney’s, written with his own hand, on the minutes of his\nreport to the attorney-general. His first emotion having passed off,\nthe President did not offer many objections. Justice must, after all,\ntake its course. And then, when all was said, although the President\nwas a kindly and a tolerably intelligent man, he was, at the same time,\na devoted and almost an ardent royalist, and he had been shocked to\nhear the Mayor of M. sur M. say the _Emperor_, and not _Bonaparte_,\nwhen alluding to the landing at Cannes.\n\nThe order for his arrest was accordingly despatched. The\ndistrict-attorney forwarded it to M. sur M. by a special messenger, at\nfull speed, and entrusted its execution to Police Inspector Javert.\n\nThe reader knows that Javert had returned to M. sur M. immediately\nafter having given his deposition.\n\nJavert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him the\norder of arrest and the command to produce the prisoner.\n\nThe messenger himself was a very clever member of the police, who, in\ntwo words, informed Javert of what had taken place at Arras. The order\nof arrest, signed by the district-attorney, was couched in these words:\n“Inspector Javert will apprehend the body of the Sieur Madeleine, mayor\nof M. sur M., who, in this day’s session of the court, was recognized\nas the liberated convict, Jean Valjean.”\n\n\nAny one who did not know Javert, and who had chanced to see him at the\nmoment when he penetrated the antechamber of the infirmary, could have\ndivined nothing of what had taken place, and would have thought his air\nthe most ordinary in the world. He was cool, calm, grave, his gray hair\nwas perfectly smooth upon his temples, and he had just mounted the\nstairs with his habitual deliberation. Any one who was thoroughly\nacquainted with him, and who had examined him attentively at the\nmoment, would have shuddered. The buckle of his leather stock was under\nhis left ear instead of at the nape of his neck. This betrayed unwonted\nagitation.\n\nJavert was a complete character, who never had a wrinkle in his duty or\nin his uniform; methodical with malefactors, rigid with the buttons of\nhis coat.\n\nThat he should have set the buckle of his stock awry, it was\nindispensable that there should have taken place in him one of those\nemotions which may be designated as internal earthquakes.\n\nHe had come in a simple way, had made a requisition on the neighboring\npost for a corporal and four soldiers, had left the soldiers in the\ncourtyard, had had Fantine’s room pointed out to him by the portress,\nwho was utterly unsuspicious, accustomed as she was to seeing armed men\ninquiring for the mayor.\n\nOn arriving at Fantine’s chamber, Javert turned the handle, pushed the\ndoor open with the gentleness of a sick-nurse or a police spy, and\nentered.\n\nProperly speaking, he did not enter. He stood erect in the half-open\ndoor, his hat on his head and his left hand thrust into his coat, which\nwas buttoned up to the chin. In the bend of his elbow the leaden head\nof his enormous cane, which was hidden behind him, could be seen.\n\nThus he remained for nearly a minute, without his presence being\nperceived. All at once Fantine raised her eyes, saw him, and made M.\nMadeleine turn round.\n\nThe instant that Madeleine’s glance encountered Javert’s glance,\nJavert, without stirring, without moving from his post, without\napproaching him, became terrible. No human sentiment can be as terrible\nas joy.\n\nIt was the visage of a demon who has just found his damned soul.\n\nThe satisfaction of at last getting hold of Jean Valjean caused all\nthat was in his soul to appear in his countenance. The depths having\nbeen stirred up, mounted to the surface. The humiliation of having, in\nsome slight degree, lost the scent, and of having indulged, for a few\nmoments, in an error with regard to Champmathieu, was effaced by pride\nat having so well and accurately divined in the first place, and of\nhaving for so long cherished a just instinct. Javert’s content shone\nforth in his sovereign attitude. The deformity of triumph overspread\nthat narrow brow. All the demonstrations of horror which a satisfied\nface can afford were there.\n\nJavert was in heaven at that moment. Without putting the thing clearly\nto himself, but with a confused intuition of the necessity of his\npresence and of his success, he, Javert, personified justice, light,\nand truth in their celestial function of crushing out evil. Behind him\nand around him, at an infinite distance, he had authority, reason, the\ncase judged, the legal conscience, the public prosecution, all the\nstars; he was protecting order, he was causing the law to yield up its\nthunders, he was avenging society, he was lending a helping hand to the\nabsolute, he was standing erect in the midst of a glory. There existed\nin his victory a remnant of defiance and of combat. Erect, haughty,\nbrilliant, he flaunted abroad in open day the superhuman bestiality of\na ferocious archangel. The terrible shadow of the action which he was\naccomplishing caused the vague flash of the social sword to be visible\nin his clenched fist; happy and indignant, he held his heel upon crime,\nvice, rebellion, perdition, hell; he was radiant, he exterminated, he\nsmiled, and there was an incontestable grandeur in this monstrous Saint\nMichael.\n\nJavert, though frightful, had nothing ignoble about him.\n\nProbity, sincerity, candor, conviction, the sense of duty, are things\nwhich may become hideous when wrongly directed; but which, even when\nhideous, remain grand: their majesty, the majesty peculiar to the human\nconscience, clings to them in the midst of horror; they are virtues\nwhich have one vice,—error. The honest, pitiless joy of a fanatic in\nthe full flood of his atrocity preserves a certain lugubriously\nvenerable radiance. Without himself suspecting the fact, Javert in his\nformidable happiness was to be pitied, as is every ignorant man who\ntriumphs. Nothing could be so poignant and so terrible as this face,\nwherein was displayed all that may be designated as the evil of the\ngood.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—AUTHORITY REASSERTS ITS RIGHTS\n\n\nFantine had not seen Javert since the day on which the mayor had torn\nher from the man. Her ailing brain comprehended nothing, but the only\nthing which she did not doubt was that he had come to get her. She\ncould not endure that terrible face; she felt her life quitting her;\nshe hid her face in both hands, and shrieked in her anguish:—\n\n“Monsieur Madeleine, save me!”\n\n\nJean Valjean—we shall henceforth not speak of him otherwise—had risen.\nHe said to Fantine in the gentlest and calmest of voices:—\n\n“Be at ease; it is not for you that he is come.”\n\n\nThen he addressed Javert, and said:—\n\n“I know what you want.”\n\n\nJavert replied:—\n\n“Be quick about it!”\n\n\nThere lay in the inflection of voice which accompanied these words\nsomething indescribably fierce and frenzied. Javert did not say, “Be\nquick about it!” he said “Bequiabouit.”\n\n\nNo orthography can do justice to the accent with which it was uttered:\nit was no longer a human word: it was a roar.\n\nHe did not proceed according to his custom, he did not enter into the\nmatter, he exhibited no warrant of arrest. In his eyes, Jean Valjean\nwas a sort of mysterious combatant, who was not to be laid hands upon,\na wrestler in the dark whom he had had in his grasp for the last five\nyears, without being able to throw him. This arrest was not a\nbeginning, but an end. He confined himself to saying, “Be quick about\nit!”\n\n\nAs he spoke thus, he did not advance a single step; he hurled at Jean\nValjean a glance which he threw out like a grappling-hook, and with\nwhich he was accustomed to draw wretches violently to him.\n\nIt was this glance which Fantine had felt penetrating to the very\nmarrow of her bones two months previously.\n\nAt Javert’s exclamation, Fantine opened her eyes once more. But the\nmayor was there; what had she to fear?\n\nJavert advanced to the middle of the room, and cried:—\n\n“See here now! Art thou coming?”\n\n\nThe unhappy woman glanced about her. No one was present excepting the\nnun and the mayor. To whom could that abject use of “thou” be\naddressed? To her only. She shuddered.\n\nThen she beheld a most unprecedented thing, a thing so unprecedented\nthat nothing equal to it had appeared to her even in the blackest\ndeliriums of fever.\n\nShe beheld Javert, the police spy, seize the mayor by the collar; she\nsaw the mayor bow his head. It seemed to her that the world was coming\nto an end.\n\nJavert had, in fact, grasped Jean Valjean by the collar.\n\n“Monsieur le Maire!” shrieked Fantine.\n\nJavert burst out laughing with that frightful laugh which displayed all\nhis gums.\n\n“There is no longer any Monsieur le Maire here!”\n\n\nJean Valjean made no attempt to disengage the hand which grasped the\ncollar of his coat. He said:—\n\n“Javert—”\n\n\nJavert interrupted him: “Call me Mr. Inspector.”\n\n\n“Monsieur,” said Jean Valjean, “I should like to say a word to you in\nprivate.”\n\n\n“Aloud! Say it aloud!” replied Javert; “people are in the habit of\ntalking aloud to me.”\n\n\nJean Valjean went on in a lower tone:—\n\n“I have a request to make of you—”\n\n\n“I tell you to speak loud.”\n\n\n“But you alone should hear it—”\n\n\n“What difference does that make to me? I shall not listen.”\n\n\nJean Valjean turned towards him and said very rapidly and in a very low\nvoice:—\n\n“Grant me three days’ grace! three days in which to go and fetch the\nchild of this unhappy woman. I will pay whatever is necessary. You\nshall accompany me if you choose.”\n\n\n“You are making sport of me!” cried Javert. “Come now, I did not think\nyou such a fool! You ask me to give you three days in which to run\naway! You say that it is for the purpose of fetching that creature’s\nchild! Ah! Ah! That’s good! That’s really capital!”\n\n\nFantine was seized with a fit of trembling.\n\n“My child!” she cried, “to go and fetch my child! She is not here,\nthen! Answer me, sister; where is Cosette? I want my child! Monsieur\nMadeleine! Monsieur le Maire!”\n\n\nJavert stamped his foot.\n\n“And now there’s the other one! Will you hold your tongue, you hussy?\nIt’s a pretty sort of a place where convicts are magistrates, and where\nwomen of the town are cared for like countesses! Ah! But we are going\nto change all that; it is high time!”\n\n\nHe stared intently at Fantine, and added, once more taking into his\ngrasp Jean Valjean’s cravat, shirt and collar:—\n\n“I tell you that there is no Monsieur Madeleine and that there is no\nMonsieur le Maire. There is a thief, a brigand, a convict named Jean\nValjean! And I have him in my grasp! That’s what there is!”\n\n\nFantine raised herself in bed with a bound, supporting herself on her\nstiffened arms and on both hands: she gazed at Jean Valjean, she gazed\nat Javert, she gazed at the nun, she opened her mouth as though to\nspeak; a rattle proceeded from the depths of her throat, her teeth\nchattered; she stretched out her arms in her agony, opening her hands\nconvulsively, and fumbling about her like a drowning person; then\nsuddenly fell back on her pillow.\n\nHer head struck the head-board of the bed and fell forwards on her\nbreast, with gaping mouth and staring, sightless eyes.\n\nShe was dead.\n\nJean Valjean laid his hand upon the detaining hand of Javert, and\nopened it as he would have opened the hand of a baby; then he said to\nJavert:—\n\n“You have murdered that woman.”\n\n\n“Let’s have an end of this!” shouted Javert, in a fury; “I am not here\nto listen to argument. Let us economize all that; the guard is below;\nmarch on instantly, or you’ll get the thumb-screws!”\n\n\nIn the corner of the room stood an old iron bedstead, which was in a\ndecidedly decrepit state, and which served the sisters as a camp-bed\nwhen they were watching with the sick. Jean Valjean stepped up to this\nbed, in a twinkling wrenched off the head-piece, which was already in a\ndilapidated condition, an easy matter to muscles like his, grasped the\nprincipal rod like a bludgeon, and glanced at Javert. Javert retreated\ntowards the door. Jean Valjean, armed with his bar of iron, walked\nslowly up to Fantine’s couch. When he arrived there he turned and said\nto Javert, in a voice that was barely audible:—\n\n“I advise you not to disturb me at this moment.”\n\n\nOne thing is certain, and that is, that Javert trembled.\n\nIt did occur to him to summon the guard, but Jean Valjean might avail\nhimself of that moment to effect his escape; so he remained, grasped\nhis cane by the small end, and leaned against the door-post, without\nremoving his eyes from Jean Valjean.\n\nJean Valjean rested his elbow on the knob at the head of the bed, and\nhis brow on his hand, and began to contemplate the motionless body of\nFantine, which lay extended there. He remained thus, mute, absorbed,\nevidently with no further thought of anything connected with this life.\nUpon his face and in his attitude there was nothing but inexpressible\npity. After a few moments of this meditation he bent towards Fantine,\nand spoke to her in a low voice.\n\nWhat did he say to her? What could this man, who was reproved, say to\nthat woman, who was dead? What words were those? No one on earth heard\nthem. Did the dead woman hear them? There are some touching illusions\nwhich are, perhaps, sublime realities. The point as to which there\nexists no doubt is, that Sister Simplice, the sole witness of the\nincident, often said that at the moment that Jean Valjean whispered in\nFantine’s ear, she distinctly beheld an ineffable smile dawn on those\npale lips, and in those dim eyes, filled with the amazement of the\ntomb.\n\nJean Valjean took Fantine’s head in both his hands, and arranged it on\nthe pillow as a mother might have done for her child; then he tied the\nstring of her chemise, and smoothed her hair back under her cap. That\ndone, he closed her eyes.\n\nFantine’s face seemed strangely illuminated at that moment.\n\nDeath, that signifies entrance into the great light.\n\nFantine’s hand was hanging over the side of the bed. Jean Valjean knelt\ndown before that hand, lifted it gently, and kissed it.\n\nThen he rose, and turned to Javert.\n\n“Now,” said he, “I am at your disposal.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—A SUITABLE TOMB\n\n\nJavert deposited Jean Valjean in the city prison.\n\nThe arrest of M. Madeleine occasioned a sensation, or rather, an\nextraordinary commotion in M. sur M. We are sorry that we cannot\nconceal the fact, that at the single word, “He was a convict,” nearly\nevery one deserted him. In less than two hours all the good that he had\ndone had been forgotten, and he was nothing but a “convict from the\ngalleys.” It is just to add that the details of what had taken place at\nArras were not yet known. All day long conversations like the following\nwere to be heard in all quarters of the town:—\n\n“You don’t know? He was a liberated convict!” “Who?” “The mayor.” “Bah!\nM. Madeleine?” “Yes.” “Really?” “His name was not Madeleine at all; he\nhad a frightful name, Béjean, Bojean, Boujean.” “Ah! Good God!” “He has\nbeen arrested.” “Arrested!” “In prison, in the city prison, while\nwaiting to be transferred.” “Until he is transferred!” “He is to be\ntransferred!” “Where is he to be taken?” “He will be tried at the\nAssizes for a highway robbery which he committed long ago.” “Well! I\nsuspected as much. That man was too good, too perfect, too affected. He\nrefused the cross; he bestowed sous on all the little scamps he came\nacross. I always thought there was some evil history back of all that.”\n\n\nThe “drawing-rooms” particularly abounded in remarks of this nature.\n\nOne old lady, a subscriber to the _Drapeau Blanc_, made the following\nremark, the depth of which it is impossible to fathom:—\n\n“I am not sorry. It will be a lesson to the Bonapartists!”\n\n\nIt was thus that the phantom which had been called M. Madeleine\nvanished from M. sur M. Only three or four persons in all the town\nremained faithful to his memory. The old portress who had served him\nwas among the number.\n\nOn the evening of that day the worthy old woman was sitting in her\nlodge, still in a thorough fright, and absorbed in sad reflections. The\nfactory had been closed all day, the carriage gate was bolted, the\nstreet was deserted. There was no one in the house but the two nuns,\nSister Perpétue and Sister Simplice, who were watching beside the body\nof Fantine.\n\nTowards the hour when M. Madeleine was accustomed to return home, the\ngood portress rose mechanically, took from a drawer the key of M.\nMadeleine’s chamber, and the flat candlestick which he used every\nevening to go up to his quarters; then she hung the key on the nail\nwhence he was accustomed to take it, and set the candlestick on one\nside, as though she was expecting him. Then she sat down again on her\nchair, and became absorbed in thought once more. The poor, good old\nwoman had done all this without being conscious of it.\n\nIt was only at the expiration of two hours that she roused herself from\nher reverie, and exclaimed, “Hold! My good God Jesus! And I hung his\nkey on the nail!”\n\n\nAt that moment the small window in the lodge opened, a hand passed\nthrough, seized the key and the candlestick, and lighted the taper at\nthe candle which was burning there.\n\nThe portress raised her eyes, and stood there with gaping mouth, and a\nshriek which she confined to her throat.\n\nShe knew that hand, that arm, the sleeve of that coat.\n\nIt was M. Madeleine.\n\nIt was several seconds before she could speak; she had a _seizure_, as\nshe said herself, when she related the adventure afterwards.\n\n“Good God, Monsieur le Maire,” she cried at last, “I thought you were—”\n\n\nShe stopped; the conclusion of her sentence would have been lacking in\nrespect towards the beginning. Jean Valjean was still Monsieur le Maire\nto her.\n\nHe finished her thought.\n\n“In prison,” said he. “I was there; I broke a bar of one of the\nwindows; I let myself drop from the top of a roof, and here I am. I am\ngoing up to my room; go and find Sister Simplice for me. She is with\nthat poor woman, no doubt.”\n\n\nThe old woman obeyed in all haste.\n\nHe gave her no orders; he was quite sure that she would guard him\nbetter than he should guard himself.\n\nNo one ever found out how he had managed to get into the courtyard\nwithout opening the big gates. He had, and always carried about him, a\npass-key which opened a little side-door; but he must have been\nsearched, and his latch-key must have been taken from him. This point\nwas never explained.\n\nHe ascended the staircase leading to his chamber. On arriving at the\ntop, he left his candle on the top step of his stairs, opened his door\nwith very little noise, went and closed his window and his shutters by\nfeeling, then returned for his candle and re-entered his room.\n\nIt was a useful precaution; it will be recollected that his window\ncould be seen from the street.\n\nHe cast a glance about him, at his table, at his chair, at his bed\nwhich had not been disturbed for three days. No trace of the disorder\nof the night before last remained. The portress had “done up” his room;\nonly she had picked out of the ashes and placed neatly on the table the\ntwo iron ends of the cudgel and the forty-sou piece which had been\nblackened by the fire.\n\nHe took a sheet of paper, on which he wrote: “These are the two tips of\nmy iron-shod cudgel and the forty-sou piece stolen from Little Gervais,\nwhich I mentioned at the Court of Assizes,” and he arranged this piece\nof paper, the bits of iron, and the coin in such a way that they were\nthe first things to be seen on entering the room. From a cupboard he\npulled out one of his old shirts, which he tore in pieces. In the\nstrips of linen thus prepared he wrapped the two silver candlesticks.\nHe betrayed neither haste nor agitation; and while he was wrapping up\nthe Bishop’s candlesticks, he nibbled at a piece of black bread. It was\nprobably the prison-bread which he had carried with him in his flight.\n\nThis was proved by the crumbs which were found on the floor of the room\nwhen the authorities made an examination later on.\n\nThere came two taps at the door.\n\n“Come in,” said he.\n\nIt was Sister Simplice.\n\nShe was pale; her eyes were red; the candle which she carried trembled\nin her hand. The peculiar feature of the violences of destiny is, that\nhowever polished or cool we may be, they wring human nature from our\nvery bowels, and force it to reappear on the surface. The emotions of\nthat day had turned the nun into a woman once more. She had wept, and\nshe was trembling.\n\nJean Valjean had just finished writing a few lines on a paper, which he\nhanded to the nun, saying, “Sister, you will give this to Monsieur le\nCuré.”\n\n\nThe paper was not folded. She cast a glance upon it.\n\n“You can read it,” said he.\n\nShe read:—\n\n“I beg Monsieur le Curé to keep an eye on all that I leave behind me.\nHe will be so good as to pay out of it the expenses of my trial, and of\nthe funeral of the woman who died yesterday. The rest is for the poor.”\n\n\nThe sister tried to speak, but she only managed to stammer a few\ninarticulate sounds. She succeeded in saying, however:—\n\n“Does not Monsieur le Maire desire to take a last look at that poor,\nunhappy woman?”\n\n\n“No,” said he; “I am pursued; it would only end in their arresting me\nin that room, and that would disturb her.”\n\n\nHe had hardly finished when a loud noise became audible on the\nstaircase. They heard a tumult of ascending footsteps, and the old\nportress saying in her loudest and most piercing tones:—\n\n“My good sir, I swear to you by the good God, that not a soul has\nentered this house all day, nor all the evening, and that I have not\neven left the door.”\n\n\nA man responded:—\n\n“But there is a light in that room, nevertheless.”\n\n\nThey recognized Javert’s voice.\n\nThe chamber was so arranged that the door in opening masked the corner\nof the wall on the right. Jean Valjean blew out the light and placed\nhimself in this angle. Sister Simplice fell on her knees near the\ntable.\n\nThe door opened.\n\nJavert entered.\n\nThe whispers of many men and the protestations of the portress were\naudible in the corridor.\n\nThe nun did not raise her eyes. She was praying.\n\nThe candle was on the chimney-piece, and gave but very little light.\n\nJavert caught sight of the nun and halted in amazement.\n\nIt will be remembered that the fundamental point in Javert, his\nelement, the very air he breathed, was veneration for all authority.\nThis was impregnable, and admitted of neither objection nor\nrestriction. In his eyes, of course, the ecclesiastical authority was\nthe chief of all; he was religious, superficial and correct on this\npoint as on all others. In his eyes, a priest was a mind, who never\nmakes a mistake; a nun was a creature who never sins; they were souls\nwalled in from this world, with a single door which never opened except\nto allow the truth to pass through.\n\nOn perceiving the sister, his first movement was to retire.\n\nBut there was also another duty which bound him and impelled him\nimperiously in the opposite direction. His second movement was to\nremain and to venture on at least one question.\n\nThis was Sister Simplice, who had never told a lie in her life. Javert\nknew it, and held her in special veneration in consequence.\n\n“Sister,” said he, “are you alone in this room?”\n\n\nA terrible moment ensued, during which the poor portress felt as though\nshe should faint.\n\nThe sister raised her eyes and answered:—\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Then,” resumed Javert, “you will excuse me if I persist; it is my\nduty; you have not seen a certain person—a man—this evening? He has\nescaped; we are in search of him—that Jean Valjean; you have not seen\nhim?”\n\n\nThe sister replied:—\n\n“No.”\n\n\nShe lied. She had lied twice in succession, one after the other,\nwithout hesitation, promptly, as a person does when sacrificing\nherself.\n\n“Pardon me,” said Javert, and he retired with a deep bow.\n\nO sainted maid! you left this world many years ago; you have rejoined\nyour sisters, the virgins, and your brothers, the angels, in the light;\nmay this lie be counted to your credit in paradise!\n\nThe sister’s affirmation was for Javert so decisive a thing that he did\nnot even observe the singularity of that candle which had but just been\nextinguished, and which was still smoking on the table.\n\nAn hour later, a man, marching amid trees and mists, was rapidly\ndeparting from M. sur M. in the direction of Paris. That man was Jean\nValjean. It has been established by the testimony of two or three\ncarters who met him, that he was carrying a bundle; that he was dressed\nin a blouse. Where had he obtained that blouse? No one ever found out.\nBut an aged workman had died in the infirmary of the factory a few days\nbefore, leaving behind him nothing but his blouse. Perhaps that was the\none.\n\nOne last word about Fantine.\n\nWe all have a mother,—the earth. Fantine was given back to that mother.\n\nThe curé thought that he was doing right, and perhaps he really was, in\nreserving as much money as possible from what Jean Valjean had left for\nthe poor. Who was concerned, after all? A convict and a woman of the\ntown. That is why he had a very simple funeral for Fantine, and reduced\nit to that strictly necessary form known as the pauper’s grave.\n\nSo Fantine was buried in the free corner of the cemetery which belongs\nto anybody and everybody, and where the poor are lost. Fortunately, God\nknows where to find the soul again. Fantine was laid in the shade,\namong the first bones that came to hand; she was subjected to the\npromiscuousness of ashes. She was thrown into the public grave. Her\ngrave resembled her bed.\n\n[THE END OF VOLUME I “FANTINE”] Enlarge\n\nFrontispiece Volume Two  2frontispiece\n\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nTitlepage Volume Two  2titlepage\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME II—COSETTE\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIRST—WATERLOO\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—WHAT IS MET WITH ON THE WAY FROM NIVELLES\n\n\nLast year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, the person\nwho is telling this story, was coming from Nivelles, and directing his\ncourse towards La Hulpe. He was on foot. He was pursuing a broad paved\nroad, which undulated between two rows of trees, over the hills which\nsucceed each other, raise the road and let it fall again, and produce\nsomething in the nature of enormous waves.\n\nHe had passed Lillois and Bois-Seigneur-Isaac. In the west he perceived\nthe slate-roofed tower of Braine-l’Alleud, which has the form of a\nreversed vase. He had just left behind a wood upon an eminence; and at\nthe angle of the crossroad, by the side of a sort of mouldy gibbet\nbearing the inscription _Ancient Barrier No. 4_, a public house,\nbearing on its front this sign: _At the Four Winds_ (Aux Quatre Vents).\n_Échabeau, Private Café_.\n\nA quarter of a league further on, he arrived at the bottom of a little\nvalley, where there is water which passes beneath an arch made through\nthe embankment of the road. The clump of sparsely planted but very\ngreen trees, which fills the valley on one side of the road, is\ndispersed over the meadows on the other, and disappears gracefully and\nas in order in the direction of Braine-l’Alleud.\n\nOn the right, close to the road, was an inn, with a four-wheeled cart\nat the door, a large bundle of hop-poles, a plough, a heap of dried\nbrushwood near a flourishing hedge, lime smoking in a square hole, and\na ladder suspended along an old penthouse with straw partitions. A\nyoung girl was weeding in a field, where a huge yellow poster, probably\nof some outside spectacle, such as a parish festival, was fluttering in\nthe wind. At one corner of the inn, beside a pool in which a flotilla\nof ducks was navigating, a badly paved path plunged into the bushes.\nThe wayfarer struck into this.\n\nAfter traversing a hundred paces, skirting a wall of the fifteenth\ncentury, surmounted by a pointed gable, with bricks set in contrast, he\nfound himself before a large door of arched stone, with a rectilinear\nimpost, in the sombre style of Louis XIV., flanked by two flat\nmedallions. A severe façade rose above this door; a wall, perpendicular\nto the façade, almost touched the door, and flanked it with an abrupt\nright angle. In the meadow before the door lay three harrows, through\nwhich, in disorder, grew all the flowers of May. The door was closed.\nThe two decrepit leaves which barred it were ornamented with an old\nrusty knocker.\n\nThe sun was charming; the branches had that soft shivering of May,\nwhich seems to proceed rather from the nests than from the wind. A\nbrave little bird, probably a lover, was carolling in a distracted\nmanner in a large tree.\n\nThe wayfarer bent over and examined a rather large circular excavation,\nresembling the hollow of a sphere, in the stone on the left, at the\nfoot of the pier of the door.\n\nAt this moment the leaves of the door parted, and a peasant woman\nemerged.\n\nShe saw the wayfarer, and perceived what he was looking at.\n\n“It was a French cannon-ball which made that,” she said to him. And she\nadded:—\n\n“That which you see there, higher up in the door, near a nail, is the\nhole of a big iron bullet as large as an egg. The bullet did not pierce\nthe wood.”\n\n\n“What is the name of this place?” inquired the wayfarer.\n\n“Hougomont,” said the peasant woman.\n\nThe traveller straightened himself up. He walked on a few paces, and\nwent off to look over the tops of the hedges. On the horizon through\nthe trees, he perceived a sort of little elevation, and on this\nelevation something which at that distance resembled a lion.\n\nHe was on the battle-field of Waterloo.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—HOUGOMONT\n\n\nHougomont,—this was a funereal spot, the beginning of the obstacle, the\nfirst resistance, which that great wood-cutter of Europe, called\nNapoleon, encountered at Waterloo, the first knot under the blows of\nhis axe.\n\nIt was a château; it is no longer anything but a farm. For the\nantiquary, Hougomont is _Hugomons_. This manor was built by Hugo, Sire\nof Somerel, the same who endowed the sixth chaplaincy of the Abbey of\nVilliers.\n\nThe traveller pushed open the door, elbowed an ancient calash under the\nporch, and entered the courtyard.\n\nThe first thing which struck him in this paddock was a door of the\nsixteenth century, which here simulates an arcade, everything else\nhaving fallen prostrate around it. A monumental aspect often has its\nbirth in ruin. In a wall near the arcade opens another arched door, of\nthe time of Henry IV., permitting a glimpse of the trees of an orchard;\nbeside this door, a manure-hole, some pickaxes, some shovels, some\ncarts, an old well, with its flagstone and its iron reel, a chicken\njumping, and a turkey spreading its tail, a chapel surmounted by a\nsmall bell-tower, a blossoming pear-tree trained in espalier against\nthe wall of the chapel—behold the court, the conquest of which was one\nof Napoleon’s dreams. This corner of earth, could he but have seized\nit, would, perhaps, have given him the world likewise. Chickens are\nscattering its dust abroad with their beaks. A growl is audible; it is\na huge dog, who shows his teeth and replaces the English.\n\nThe English behaved admirably there. Cooke’s four companies of guards\nthere held out for seven hours against the fury of an army.\n\nHougomont viewed on the map, as a geometrical plan, comprising\nbuildings and enclosures, presents a sort of irregular rectangle, one\nangle of which is nicked out. It is this angle which contains the\nsouthern door, guarded by this wall, which commands it only a gun’s\nlength away. Hougomont has two doors,—the southern door, that of the\nchâteau; and the northern door, belonging to the farm. Napoleon sent\nhis brother Jérôme against Hougomont; the divisions of Foy,\nGuilleminot, and Bachelu hurled themselves against it; nearly the\nentire corps of Reille was employed against it, and miscarried;\nKellermann’s balls were exhausted on this heroic section of wall.\nBauduin’s brigade was not strong enough to force Hougomont on the\nnorth, and the brigade of Soye could not do more than effect the\nbeginning of a breach on the south, but without taking it.\n\nThe farm buildings border the courtyard on the south. A bit of the\nnorth door, broken by the French, hangs suspended to the wall. It\nconsists of four planks nailed to two cross-beams, on which the scars\nof the attack are visible.\n\nThe northern door, which was beaten in by the French, and which has had\na piece applied to it to replace the panel suspended on the wall,\nstands half-open at the bottom of the paddock; it is cut squarely in\nthe wall, built of stone below, of brick above which closes in the\ncourtyard on the north. It is a simple door for carts, such as exist in\nall farms, with the two large leaves made of rustic planks: beyond lie\nthe meadows. The dispute over this entrance was furious. For a long\ntime, all sorts of imprints of bloody hands were visible on the\ndoor-posts. It was there that Bauduin was killed.\n\nThe storm of the combat still lingers in this courtyard; its horror is\nvisible there; the confusion of the fray was petrified there; it lives\nand it dies there; it was only yesterday. The walls are in the death\nagony, the stones fall; the breaches cry aloud; the holes are wounds;\nthe drooping, quivering trees seem to be making an effort to flee.\n\nThis courtyard was more built up in 1815 than it is to-day. Buildings\nwhich have since been pulled down then formed redans and angles.\n\nThe English barricaded themselves there; the French made their way in,\nbut could not stand their ground. Beside the chapel, one wing of the\nchâteau, the only ruin now remaining of the manor of Hougomont, rises\nin a crumbling state,—disembowelled, one might say. The château served\nfor a dungeon, the chapel for a block-house. There men exterminated\neach other. The French, fired on from every point,—from behind the\nwalls, from the summits of the garrets, from the depths of the cellars,\nthrough all the casements, through all the air-holes, through every\ncrack in the stones,—fetched fagots and set fire to walls and men; the\nreply to the grape-shot was a conflagration.\n\nIn the ruined wing, through windows garnished with bars of iron, the\ndismantled chambers of the main building of brick are visible; the\nEnglish guards were in ambush in these rooms; the spiral of the\nstaircase, cracked from the ground floor to the very roof, appears like\nthe inside of a broken shell. The staircase has two stories; the\nEnglish, besieged on the staircase, and massed on its upper steps, had\ncut off the lower steps. These consisted of large slabs of blue stone,\nwhich form a heap among the nettles. Half a score of steps still cling\nto the wall; on the first is cut the figure of a trident. These\ninaccessible steps are solid in their niches. All the rest resembles a\njaw which has been denuded of its teeth. There are two old trees there:\none is dead; the other is wounded at its base, and is clothed with\nverdure in April. Since 1815 it has taken to growing through the\nstaircase.\n\nA massacre took place in the chapel. The interior, which has recovered\nits calm, is singular. The mass has not been said there since the\ncarnage. Nevertheless, the altar has been left there—an altar of\nunpolished wood, placed against a background of roughhewn stone. Four\nwhitewashed walls, a door opposite the altar, two small arched windows;\nover the door a large wooden crucifix, below the crucifix a square\nair-hole stopped up with a bundle of hay; on the ground, in one corner,\nan old window-frame with the glass all broken to pieces—such is the\nchapel. Near the altar there is nailed up a wooden statue of Saint\nAnne, of the fifteenth century; the head of the infant Jesus has been\ncarried off by a large ball. The French, who were masters of the chapel\nfor a moment, and were then dislodged, set fire to it. The flames\nfilled this building; it was a perfect furnace; the door was burned,\nthe floor was burned, the wooden Christ was not burned. The fire preyed\nupon his feet, of which only the blackened stumps are now to be seen;\nthen it stopped,—a miracle, according to the assertion of the people of\nthe neighborhood. The infant Jesus, decapitated, was less fortunate\nthan the Christ.\n\nThe walls are covered with inscriptions. Near the feet of Christ this\nname is to be read: _Henquinez_. Then these others: _Conde de Rio Maior\nMarques y Marquesa de Almagro (Habana)_. There are French names with\nexclamation points,—a sign of wrath. The wall was freshly whitewashed\nin 1849. The nations insulted each other there.\n\nIt was at the door of this chapel that the corpse was picked up which\nheld an axe in its hand; this corpse was Sub-Lieutenant Legros.\n\nOn emerging from the chapel, a well is visible on the left. There are\ntwo in this courtyard. One inquires, Why is there no bucket and pulley\nto this? It is because water is no longer drawn there. Why is water not\ndrawn there? Because it is full of skeletons.\n\nThe last person who drew water from the well was named Guillaume van\nKylsom. He was a peasant who lived at Hougomont, and was gardener\nthere. On the 18th of June, 1815, his family fled and concealed\nthemselves in the woods.\n\nThe forest surrounding the Abbey of Villiers sheltered these\nunfortunate people who had been scattered abroad, for many days and\nnights. There are at this day certain traces recognizable, such as old\nboles of burned trees, which mark the site of these poor bivouacs\ntrembling in the depths of the thickets.\n\nGuillaume van Kylsom remained at Hougomont, “to guard the château,” and\nconcealed himself in the cellar. The English discovered him there. They\ntore him from his hiding-place, and the combatants forced this\nfrightened man to serve them, by administering blows with the flats of\ntheir swords. They were thirsty; this Guillaume brought them water. It\nwas from this well that he drew it. Many drank there their last\ndraught. This well where drank so many of the dead was destined to die\nitself.\n\nAfter the engagement, they were in haste to bury the dead bodies. Death\nhas a fashion of harassing victory, and she causes the pest to follow\nglory. The typhus is a concomitant of triumph. This well was deep, and\nit was turned into a sepulchre. Three hundred dead bodies were cast\ninto it. With too much haste perhaps. Were they all dead? Legend says\nthey were not. It seems that on the night succeeding the interment,\nfeeble voices were heard calling from the well.\n\nThis well is isolated in the middle of the courtyard. Three walls, part\nstone, part brick, and simulating a small, square tower, and folded\nlike the leaves of a screen, surround it on all sides. The fourth side\nis open. It is there that the water was drawn. The wall at the bottom\nhas a sort of shapeless loophole, possibly the hole made by a shell.\nThis little tower had a platform, of which only the beams remain. The\niron supports of the well on the right form a cross. On leaning over,\nthe eye is lost in a deep cylinder of brick which is filled with a\nheaped-up mass of shadows. The base of the walls all about the well is\nconcealed in a growth of nettles.\n\nThis well has not in front of it that large blue slab which forms the\ntable for all wells in Belgium. The slab has here been replaced by a\ncross-beam, against which lean five or six shapeless fragments of\nknotty and petrified wood which resemble huge bones. There is no longer\neither pail, chain, or pulley; but there is still the stone basin which\nserved the overflow. The rain-water collects there, and from time to\ntime a bird of the neighboring forests comes thither to drink, and then\nflies away. One house in this ruin, the farmhouse, is still inhabited.\nThe door of this house opens on the courtyard. Upon this door, beside a\npretty Gothic lock-plate, there is an iron handle with trefoils placed\nslanting. At the moment when the Hanoverian lieutenant, Wilda, grasped\nthis handle in order to take refuge in the farm, a French sapper hewed\noff his hand with an axe.\n\nThe family who occupy the house had for their grandfather Guillaume van\nKylsom, the old gardener, dead long since. A woman with gray hair said\nto us: “I was there. I was three years old. My sister, who was older,\nwas terrified and wept. They carried us off to the woods. I went there\nin my mother’s arms. We glued our ears to the earth to hear. I imitated\nthe cannon, and went _boum! boum!_”\n\n\nA door opening from the courtyard on the left led into the orchard, so\nwe were told. The orchard is terrible.\n\nIt is in three parts; one might almost say, in three acts. The first\npart is a garden, the second is an orchard, the third is a wood. These\nthree parts have a common enclosure: on the side of the entrance, the\nbuildings of the château and the farm; on the left, a hedge; on the\nright, a wall; and at the end, a wall. The wall on the right is of\nbrick, the wall at the bottom is of stone. One enters the garden first.\nIt slopes downwards, is planted with gooseberry bushes, choked with a\nwild growth of vegetation, and terminated by a monumental terrace of\ncut stone, with balustrade with a double curve.\n\nIt was a seignorial garden in the first French style which preceded Le\nNôtre; to-day it is ruins and briars. The pilasters are surmounted by\nglobes which resemble cannon-balls of stone. Forty-three balusters can\nstill be counted on their sockets; the rest lie prostrate in the grass.\nAlmost all bear scratches of bullets. One broken baluster is placed on\nthe pediment like a fractured leg.\n\nIt was in this garden, further down than the orchard, that six\nlight-infantry men of the 1st, having made their way thither, and being\nunable to escape, hunted down and caught like bears in their dens,\naccepted the combat with two Hanoverian companies, one of which was\narmed with carbines. The Hanoverians lined this balustrade and fired\nfrom above. The infantry men, replying from below, six against two\nhundred, intrepid and with no shelter save the currant-bushes, took a\nquarter of an hour to die.\n\nOne mounts a few steps and passes from the garden into the orchard,\nproperly speaking. There, within the limits of those few square\nfathoms, fifteen hundred men fell in less than an hour. The wall seems\nready to renew the combat. Thirty-eight loopholes, pierced by the\nEnglish at irregular heights, are there still. In front of the sixth\nare placed two English tombs of granite. There are loopholes only in\nthe south wall, as the principal attack came from that quarter. The\nwall is hidden on the outside by a tall hedge; the French came up,\nthinking that they had to deal only with a hedge, crossed it, and found\nthe wall both an obstacle and an ambuscade, with the English guards\nbehind it, the thirty-eight loopholes firing at once a shower of\ngrape-shot and balls, and Soye’s brigade was broken against it. Thus\nWaterloo began.\n\nNevertheless, the orchard was taken. As they had no ladders, the French\nscaled it with their nails. They fought hand to hand amid the trees.\nAll this grass has been soaked in blood. A battalion of Nassau, seven\nhundred strong, was overwhelmed there. The outside of the wall, against\nwhich Kellermann’s two batteries were trained, is gnawed by grape-shot.\n\nThis orchard is sentient, like others, in the month of May. It has its\nbuttercups and its daisies; the grass is tall there; the cart-horses\nbrowse there; cords of hair, on which linen is drying, traverse the\nspaces between the trees and force the passer-by to bend his head; one\nwalks over this uncultivated land, and one’s foot dives into\nmole-holes. In the middle of the grass one observes an uprooted\ntree-bole which lies there all verdant. Major Blackmann leaned against\nit to die. Beneath a great tree in the neighborhood fell the German\ngeneral, Duplat, descended from a French family which fled on the\nrevocation of the Edict of Nantes. An aged and falling apple-tree leans\nfar over to one side, its wound dressed with a bandage of straw and of\nclayey loam. Nearly all the apple-trees are falling with age. There is\nnot one which has not had its bullet or its biscayan.6 The skeletons of\ndead trees abound in this orchard. Crows fly through their branches,\nand at the end of it is a wood full of violets.\n\nBauduin killed, Foy wounded, conflagration, massacre, carnage, a\nrivulet formed of English blood, French blood, German blood mingled in\nfury, a well crammed with corpses, the regiment of Nassau and the\nregiment of Brunswick destroyed, Duplat killed, Blackmann killed, the\nEnglish Guards mutilated, twenty French battalions, besides the forty\nfrom Reille’s corps, decimated, three thousand men in that hovel of\nHougomont alone cut down, slashed to pieces, shot, burned, with their\nthroats cut,—and all this so that a peasant can say to-day to the\ntraveller: _Monsieur, give me three francs, and if you like, I will\nexplain to you the affair of Waterloo!_\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—THE EIGHTEENTH OF JUNE, 1815\n\n\nLet us turn back,—that is one of the story-teller’s rights,—and put\nourselves once more in the year 1815, and even a little earlier than\nthe epoch when the action narrated in the first part of this book took\nplace.\n\nIf it had not rained in the night between the 17th and the 18th of\nJune, 1815, the fate of Europe would have been different. A few drops\nof water, more or less, decided the downfall of Napoleon. All that\nProvidence required in order to make Waterloo the end of Austerlitz was\na little more rain, and a cloud traversing the sky out of season\nsufficed to make a world crumble.\n\nThe battle of Waterloo could not be begun until half-past eleven\no’clock, and that gave Blücher time to come up. Why? Because the ground\nwas wet. The artillery had to wait until it became a little firmer\nbefore they could manœuvre.\n\nNapoleon was an artillery officer, and felt the effects of this. The\nfoundation of this wonderful captain was the man who, in the report to\nthe Directory on Aboukir, said: _Such a one of our balls killed six\nmen_. All his plans of battle were arranged for projectiles. The key to\nhis victory was to make the artillery converge on one point. He treated\nthe strategy of the hostile general like a citadel, and made a breach\nin it. He overwhelmed the weak point with grape-shot; he joined and\ndissolved battles with cannon. There was something of the sharpshooter\nin his genius. To beat in squares, to pulverize regiments, to break\nlines, to crush and disperse masses,—for him everything lay in this, to\nstrike, strike, strike incessantly,—and he intrusted this task to the\ncannon-ball. A redoubtable method, and one which, united with genius,\nrendered this gloomy athlete of the pugilism of war invincible for the\nspace of fifteen years.\n\nOn the 18th of June, 1815, he relied all the more on his artillery,\nbecause he had numbers on his side. Wellington had only one hundred and\nfifty-nine mouths of fire; Napoleon had two hundred and forty.\n\nSuppose the soil dry, and the artillery capable of moving, the action\nwould have begun at six o’clock in the morning. The battle would have\nbeen won and ended at two o’clock, three hours before the change of\nfortune in favor of the Prussians. What amount of blame attaches to\nNapoleon for the loss of this battle? Is the shipwreck due to the\npilot?\n\nWas it the evident physical decline of Napoleon that complicated this\nepoch by an inward diminution of force? Had the twenty years of war\nworn out the blade as it had worn the scabbard, the soul as well as the\nbody? Did the veteran make himself disastrously felt in the leader? In\na word, was this genius, as many historians of note have thought,\nsuffering from an eclipse? Did he go into a frenzy in order to disguise\nhis weakened powers from himself? Did he begin to waver under the\ndelusion of a breath of adventure? Had he become—a grave matter in a\ngeneral—unconscious of peril? Is there an age, in this class of\nmaterial great men, who may be called the giants of action, when genius\ngrows short-sighted? Old age has no hold on the geniuses of the ideal;\nfor the Dantes and Michael Angelos to grow old is to grow in greatness;\nis it to grow less for the Hannibals and the Bonapartes? Had Napoleon\nlost the direct sense of victory? Had he reached the point where he\ncould no longer recognize the reef, could no longer divine the snare,\nno longer discern the crumbling brink of abysses? Had he lost his power\nof scenting out catastrophes? He who had in former days known all the\nroads to triumph, and who, from the summit of his chariot of lightning,\npointed them out with a sovereign finger, had he now reached that state\nof sinister amazement when he could lead his tumultuous legions\nharnessed to it, to the precipice? Was he seized at the age of\nforty-six with a supreme madness? Was that titanic charioteer of\ndestiny no longer anything more than an immense dare-devil?\n\nWe do not think so.\n\nHis plan of battle was, by the confession of all, a masterpiece. To go\nstraight to the centre of the Allies’ line, to make a breach in the\nenemy, to cut them in two, to drive the British half back on Hal, and\nthe Prussian half on Tongres, to make two shattered fragments of\nWellington and Blücher, to carry Mont-Saint-Jean, to seize Brussels, to\nhurl the German into the Rhine, and the Englishman into the sea. All\nthis was contained in that battle, according to Napoleon. Afterwards\npeople would see.\n\nOf course, we do not here pretend to furnish a history of the battle of\nWaterloo; one of the scenes of the foundation of the story which we are\nrelating is connected with this battle, but this history is not our\nsubject; this history, moreover, has been finished, and finished in a\nmasterly manner, from one point of view by Napoleon, and from another\npoint of view by a whole pleiad of historians.7\n\nAs for us, we leave the historians at loggerheads; we are but a distant\nwitness, a passer-by on the plain, a seeker bending over that soil all\nmade of human flesh, taking appearances for realities, perchance; we\nhave no right to oppose, in the name of science, a collection of facts\nwhich contain illusions, no doubt; we possess neither military practice\nnor strategic ability which authorize a system; in our opinion, a chain\nof accidents dominated the two leaders at Waterloo; and when it becomes\na question of destiny, that mysterious culprit, we judge like that\ningenious judge, the populace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—A\n\n\nThose persons who wish to gain a clear idea of the battle of Waterloo\nhave only to place, mentally, on the ground, a capital A. The left limb\nof the A is the road to Nivelles, the right limb is the road to\nGenappe, the tie of the A is the hollow road to Ohain from\nBraine-l’Alleud. The top of the A is Mont-Saint-Jean, where Wellington\nis; the lower left tip is Hougomont, where Reille is stationed with\nJérôme Bonaparte; the right tip is the Belle-Alliance, where Napoleon\nwas. At the centre of this chord is the precise point where the final\nword of the battle was pronounced. It was there that the lion has been\nplaced, the involuntary symbol of the supreme heroism of the Imperial\nGuard.\n\nThe triangle included in the top of the A, between the two limbs and\nthe tie, is the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean. The dispute over this\nplateau constituted the whole battle. The wings of the two armies\nextended to the right and left of the two roads to Genappe and\nNivelles; d’Erlon facing Picton, Reille facing Hill.\n\nBehind the tip of the A, behind the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, is the\nforest of Soignes.\n\nAs for the plain itself, let the reader picture to himself a vast\nundulating sweep of ground; each rise commands the next rise, and all\nthe undulations mount towards Mont-Saint-Jean, and there end in the\nforest.\n\nTwo hostile troops on a field of battle are two wrestlers. It is a\nquestion of seizing the opponent round the waist. The one seeks to trip\nup the other. They clutch at everything: a bush is a point of support;\nan angle of the wall offers them a rest to the shoulder; for the lack\nof a hovel under whose cover they can draw up, a regiment yields its\nground; an unevenness in the ground, a chance turn in the landscape, a\ncross-path encountered at the right moment, a grove, a ravine, can stay\nthe heel of that colossus which is called an army, and prevent its\nretreat. He who quits the field is beaten; hence the necessity\ndevolving on the responsible leader, of examining the most\ninsignificant clump of trees, and of studying deeply the slightest\nrelief in the ground.\n\nThe two generals had attentively studied the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean,\nnow called the plain of Waterloo. In the preceding year, Wellington,\nwith the sagacity of foresight, had examined it as the possible seat of\na great battle. Upon this spot, and for this duel, on the 18th of June,\nWellington had the good post, Napoleon the bad post. The English army\nwas stationed above, the French army below.\n\nIt is almost superfluous here to sketch the appearance of Napoleon on\nhorseback, glass in hand, upon the heights of Rossomme, at daybreak, on\nJune 18, 1815. All the world has seen him before we can show him. That\ncalm profile under the little three-cornered hat of the school of\nBrienne, that green uniform, the white revers concealing the star of\nthe Legion of Honor, his great coat hiding his epaulets, the corner of\nred ribbon peeping from beneath his vest, his leather trousers, the\nwhite horse with the saddle-cloth of purple velvet bearing on the\ncorners crowned N’s and eagles, Hessian boots over silk stockings,\nsilver spurs, the sword of Marengo,—that whole figure of the last of\nthe Cæsars is present to all imaginations, saluted with acclamations by\nsome, severely regarded by others.\n\nThat figure stood for a long time wholly in the light; this arose from\na certain legendary dimness evolved by the majority of heroes, and\nwhich always veils the truth for a longer or shorter time; but to-day\nhistory and daylight have arrived.\n\nThat light called history is pitiless; it possesses this peculiar and\ndivine quality, that, pure light as it is, and precisely because it is\nwholly light, it often casts a shadow in places where people had\nhitherto beheld rays; from the same man it constructs two different\nphantoms, and the one attacks the other and executes justice on it, and\nthe shadows of the despot contend with the brilliancy of the leader.\nHence arises a truer measure in the definitive judgments of nations.\nBabylon violated lessens Alexander, Rome enchained lessens Cæsar,\nJerusalem murdered lessens Titus, tyranny follows the tyrant. It is a\nmisfortune for a man to leave behind him the night which bears his\nform.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—THE QUID OBSCURUM OF BATTLES\n\n\nEvery one is acquainted with the first phase of this battle; a\nbeginning which was troubled, uncertain, hesitating, menacing to both\narmies, but still more so for the English than for the French.\n\nIt had rained all night, the earth had been cut up by the downpour, the\nwater had accumulated here and there in the hollows of the plain as if\nin casks; at some points the gear of the artillery carriages was buried\nup to the axles, the circingles of the horses were dripping with liquid\nmud. If the wheat and rye trampled down by this cohort of transports on\nthe march had not filled in the ruts and strewn a litter beneath the\nwheels, all movement, particularly in the valleys, in the direction of\nPapelotte would have been impossible.\n\nThe affair began late. Napoleon, as we have already explained, was in\nthe habit of keeping all his artillery well in hand, like a pistol,\naiming it now at one point, now at another, of the battle; and it had\nbeen his wish to wait until the horse batteries could move and gallop\nfreely. In order to do that it was necessary that the sun should come\nout and dry the soil. But the sun did not make its appearance. It was\nno longer the rendezvous of Austerlitz. When the first cannon was\nfired, the English general, Colville, looked at his watch, and noted\nthat it was thirty-five minutes past eleven.\n\nThe action was begun furiously, with more fury, perhaps, than the\nEmperor would have wished, by the left wing of the French resting on\nHougomont. At the same time Napoleon attacked the centre by hurling\nQuiot’s brigade on La Haie-Sainte, and Ney pushed forward the right\nwing of the French against the left wing of the English, which rested\non Papelotte.\n\nThe attack on Hougomont was something of a feint; the plan was to draw\nWellington thither, and to make him swerve to the left. This plan would\nhave succeeded if the four companies of the English guards and the\nbrave Belgians of Perponcher’s division had not held the position\nsolidly, and Wellington, instead of massing his troops there, could\nconfine himself to despatching thither, as reinforcements, only four\nmore companies of guards and one battalion from Brunswick.\n\nThe attack of the right wing of the French on Papelotte was calculated,\nin fact, to overthrow the English left, to cut off the road to\nBrussels, to bar the passage against possible Prussians, to force\nMont-Saint-Jean, to turn Wellington back on Hougomont, thence on\nBraine-l’Alleud, thence on Hal; nothing easier. With the exception of a\nfew incidents this attack succeeded. Papelotte was taken; La\nHaie-Sainte was carried.\n\nA detail to be noted. There was in the English infantry, particularly\nin Kempt’s brigade, a great many raw recruits. These young soldiers\nwere valiant in the presence of our redoubtable infantry; their\ninexperience extricated them intrepidly from the dilemma; they\nperformed particularly excellent service as skirmishers: the soldier\nskirmisher, left somewhat to himself, becomes, so to speak, his own\ngeneral. These recruits displayed some of the French ingenuity and\nfury. This novice of an infantry had dash. This displeased Wellington.\n\nAfter the taking of La Haie-Sainte the battle wavered.\n\nThere is in this day an obscure interval, from midday to four o’clock;\nthe middle portion of this battle is almost indistinct, and\nparticipates in the sombreness of the hand-to-hand conflict. Twilight\nreigns over it. We perceive vast fluctuations in that fog, a dizzy\nmirage, paraphernalia of war almost unknown to-day, pendant colbacks,\nfloating sabre-taches, cross-belts, cartridge-boxes for grenades,\nhussar dolmans, red boots with a thousand wrinkles, heavy shakos\ngarlanded with torsades, the almost black infantry of Brunswick mingled\nwith the scarlet infantry of England, the English soldiers with great,\nwhite circular pads on the slopes of their shoulders for epaulets, the\nHanoverian light-horse with their oblong casques of leather, with brass\nhands and red horse-tails, the Scotch with their bare knees and plaids,\nthe great white gaiters of our grenadiers; pictures, not strategic\nlines—what Salvator Rosa requires, not what is suited to the needs of\nGribeauval.\n\nA certain amount of tempest is always mingled with a battle. _Quid\nobscurum, quid divinum_. Each historian traces, to some extent, the\nparticular feature which pleases him amid this pell-mell. Whatever may\nbe the combinations of the generals, the shock of armed masses has an\nincalculable ebb. During the action the plans of the two leaders enter\ninto each other and become mutually thrown out of shape. Such a point\nof the field of battle devours more combatants than such another, just\nas more or less spongy soils soak up more or less quickly the water\nwhich is poured on them. It becomes necessary to pour out more soldiers\nthan one would like; a series of expenditures which are the unforeseen.\nThe line of battle waves and undulates like a thread, the trails of\nblood gush illogically, the fronts of the armies waver, the regiments\nform capes and gulfs as they enter and withdraw; all these reefs are\ncontinually moving in front of each other. Where the infantry stood the\nartillery arrives, the cavalry rushes in where the artillery was, the\nbattalions are like smoke. There was something there; seek it. It has\ndisappeared; the open spots change place, the sombre folds advance and\nretreat, a sort of wind from the sepulchre pushes forward, hurls back,\ndistends, and disperses these tragic multitudes. What is a fray? an\noscillation? The immobility of a mathematical plan expresses a minute,\nnot a day. In order to depict a battle, there is required one of those\npowerful painters who have chaos in their brushes. Rembrandt is better\nthan Vandermeulen; Vandermeulen, exact at noon, lies at three o’clock.\nGeometry is deceptive; the hurricane alone is trustworthy. That is what\nconfers on Folard the right to contradict Polybius. Let us add, that\nthere is a certain instant when the battle degenerates into a combat,\nbecomes specialized, and disperses into innumerable detailed feats,\nwhich, to borrow the expression of Napoleon himself, “belong rather to\nthe biography of the regiments than to the history of the army.” The\nhistorian has, in this case, the evident right to sum up the whole. He\ncannot do more than seize the principal outlines of the struggle, and\nit is not given to any one narrator, however conscientious he may be,\nto fix, absolutely, the form of that horrible cloud which is called a\nbattle.\n\nThis, which is true of all great armed encounters, is particularly\napplicable to Waterloo.\n\nNevertheless, at a certain moment in the afternoon the battle came to a\npoint.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—FOUR O’CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON\n\n\nTowards four o’clock the condition of the English army was serious. The\nPrince of Orange was in command of the centre, Hill of the right wing,\nPicton of the left wing. The Prince of Orange, desperate and intrepid,\nshouted to the Hollando-Belgians: “Nassau! Brunswick! Never retreat!”\nHill, having been weakened, had come up to the support of Wellington;\nPicton was dead. At the very moment when the English had captured from\nthe French the flag of the 105th of the line, the French had killed the\nEnglish general, Picton, with a bullet through the head. The battle\nhad, for Wellington, two bases of action, Hougomont and La Haie-Sainte;\nHougomont still held out, but was on fire; La Haie-Sainte was taken. Of\nthe German battalion which defended it, only forty-two men survived;\nall the officers, except five, were either dead or captured. Three\nthousand combatants had been massacred in that barn. A sergeant of the\nEnglish Guards, the foremost boxer in England, reputed invulnerable by\nhis companions, had been killed there by a little French drummer-boy.\nBaring had been dislodged, Alten put to the sword. Many flags had been\nlost, one from Alten’s division, and one from the battalion of\nLunenburg, carried by a prince of the house of Deux-Ponts. The Scotch\nGrays no longer existed; Ponsonby’s great dragoons had been hacked to\npieces. That valiant cavalry had bent beneath the lancers of Bro and\nbeneath the cuirassiers of Travers; out of twelve hundred horses, six\nhundred remained; out of three lieutenant-colonels, two lay on the\nearth,—Hamilton wounded, Mater slain. Ponsonby had fallen, riddled by\nseven lance-thrusts. Gordon was dead. Marsh was dead. Two divisions,\nthe fifth and the sixth, had been annihilated.\n\nHougomont injured, La Haie-Sainte taken, there now existed but one\nrallying-point, the centre. That point still held firm. Wellington\nreinforced it. He summoned thither Hill, who was at Merle-Braine; he\nsummoned Chassé, who was at Braine-l’Alleud.\n\nThe centre of the English army, rather concave, very dense, and very\ncompact, was strongly posted. It occupied the plateau of\nMont-Saint-Jean, having behind it the village, and in front of it the\nslope, which was tolerably steep then. It rested on that stout stone\ndwelling which at that time belonged to the domain of Nivelles, and\nwhich marks the intersection of the roads—a pile of the sixteenth\ncentury, and so robust that the cannon-balls rebounded from it without\ninjuring it. All about the plateau the English had cut the hedges here\nand there, made embrasures in the hawthorn-trees, thrust the throat of\na cannon between two branches, embattled the shrubs. There artillery\nwas ambushed in the brushwood. This punic labor, incontestably\nauthorized by war, which permits traps, was so well done, that Haxo,\nwho had been despatched by the Emperor at nine o’clock in the morning\nto reconnoitre the enemy’s batteries, had discovered nothing of it, and\nhad returned and reported to Napoleon that there were no obstacles\nexcept the two barricades which barred the road to Nivelles and to\nGenappe. It was at the season when the grain is tall; on the edge of\nthe plateau a battalion of Kempt’s brigade, the 95th, armed with\ncarabines, was concealed in the tall wheat.\n\nThus assured and buttressed, the centre of the Anglo-Dutch army was\nwell posted. The peril of this position lay in the forest of Soignes,\nthen adjoining the field of battle, and intersected by the ponds of\nGroenendael and Boitsfort. An army could not retreat thither without\ndissolving; the regiments would have broken up immediately there. The\nartillery would have been lost among the morasses. The retreat,\naccording to many a man versed in the art,—though it is disputed by\nothers,—would have been a disorganized flight.\n\nTo this centre, Wellington added one of Chassé‘s brigades taken from\nthe right wing, and one of Wincke’s brigades taken from the left wing,\nplus Clinton’s division. To his English, to the regiments of Halkett,\nto the brigades of Mitchell, to the guards of Maitland, he gave as\nreinforcements and aids, the infantry of Brunswick, Nassau’s\ncontingent, Kielmansegg’s Hanoverians, and Ompteda’s Germans. This\nplaced twenty-six battalions under his hand. _The right wing_, as\nCharras says, _was thrown back on the centre_. An enormous battery was\nmasked by sacks of earth at the spot where there now stands what is\ncalled the “Museum of Waterloo.” Besides this, Wellington had, behind a\nrise in the ground, Somerset’s Dragoon Guards, fourteen hundred horse\nstrong. It was the remaining half of the justly celebrated English\ncavalry. Ponsonby destroyed, Somerset remained.\n\nThe battery, which, if completed, would have been almost a redoubt, was\nranged behind a very low garden wall, backed up with a coating of bags\nof sand and a large slope of earth. This work was not finished; there\nhad been no time to make a palisade for it.\n\nWellington, uneasy but impassive, was on horseback, and there remained\nthe whole day in the same attitude, a little in advance of the old mill\nof Mont-Saint-Jean, which is still in existence, beneath an elm, which\nan Englishman, an enthusiastic vandal, purchased later on for two\nhundred francs, cut down, and carried off. Wellington was coldly\nheroic. The bullets rained about him. His aide-de-camp, Gordon, fell at\nhis side. Lord Hill, pointing to a shell which had burst, said to him:\n“My lord, what are your orders in case you are killed?” “To do like\nme,” replied Wellington. To Clinton he said laconically, “To hold this\nspot to the last man.” The day was evidently turning out ill.\nWellington shouted to his old companions of Talavera, of Vittoria, of\nSalamanca: “Boys, can retreat be thought of? Think of old England!”\n\n\nTowards four o’clock, the English line drew back. Suddenly nothing was\nvisible on the crest of the plateau except the artillery and the\nsharpshooters; the rest had disappeared: the regiments, dislodged by\nthe shells and the French bullets, retreated into the bottom, now\nintersected by the back road of the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean; a\nretrograde movement took place, the English front hid itself,\nWellington drew back. “The beginning of retreat!” cried Napoleon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—NAPOLEON IN A GOOD HUMOR\n\n\nThe Emperor, though ill and discommoded on horseback by a local\ntrouble, had never been in a better humor than on that day. His\nimpenetrability had been smiling ever since the morning. On the 18th of\nJune, that profound soul masked by marble beamed blindly. The man who\nhad been gloomy at Austerlitz was gay at Waterloo. The greatest\nfavorites of destiny make mistakes. Our joys are composed of shadow.\nThe supreme smile is God’s alone.\n\n_Ridet Cæsar, Pompeius flebit_, said the legionaries of the Fulminatrix\nLegion. Pompey was not destined to weep on that occasion, but it is\ncertain that Cæsar laughed. While exploring on horseback at one o’clock\non the preceding night, in storm and rain, in company with Bertrand,\nthe communes in the neighborhood of Rossomme, satisfied at the sight of\nthe long line of the English camp-fires illuminating the whole horizon\nfrom Frischemont to Braine-l’Alleud, it had seemed to him that fate, to\nwhom he had assigned a day on the field of Waterloo, was exact to the\nappointment; he stopped his horse, and remained for some time\nmotionless, gazing at the lightning and listening to the thunder; and\nthis fatalist was heard to cast into the darkness this mysterious\nsaying, “We are in accord.” Napoleon was mistaken. They were no longer\nin accord.\n\nHe took not a moment for sleep; every instant of that night was marked\nby a joy for him. He traversed the line of the principal outposts,\nhalting here and there to talk to the sentinels. At half-past two, near\nthe wood of Hougomont, he heard the tread of a column on the march; he\nthought at the moment that it was a retreat on the part of Wellington.\nHe said: “It is the rear-guard of the English getting under way for the\npurpose of decamping. I will take prisoners the six thousand English\nwho have just arrived at Ostend.” He conversed expansively; he regained\nthe animation which he had shown at his landing on the first of March,\nwhen he pointed out to the Grand-Marshal the enthusiastic peasant of\nthe Gulf Juan, and cried, “Well, Bertrand, here is a reinforcement\nalready!” On the night of the 17th to the 18th of June he rallied\nWellington. “That little Englishman needs a lesson,” said Napoleon. The\nrain redoubled in violence; the thunder rolled while the Emperor was\nspeaking.\n\nAt half-past three o’clock in the morning, he lost one illusion;\nofficers who had been despatched to reconnoitre announced to him that\nthe enemy was not making any movement. Nothing was stirring; not a\nbivouac-fire had been extinguished; the English army was asleep. The\nsilence on earth was profound; the only noise was in the heavens. At\nfour o’clock, a peasant was brought in to him by the scouts; this\npeasant had served as guide to a brigade of English cavalry, probably\nVivian’s brigade, which was on its way to take up a position in the\nvillage of Ohain, at the extreme left. At five o’clock, two Belgian\ndeserters reported to him that they had just quitted their regiment,\nand that the English army was ready for battle. “So much the better!”\nexclaimed Napoleon. “I prefer to overthrow them rather than to drive\nthem back.”\n\n\nIn the morning he dismounted in the mud on the slope which forms an\nangle with the Plancenoit road, had a kitchen table and a peasant’s\nchair brought to him from the farm of Rossomme, seated himself, with a\ntruss of straw for a carpet, and spread out on the table the chart of\nthe battle-field, saying to Soult as he did so, “A pretty\nchecker-board.”\n\n\nIn consequence of the rains during the night, the transports of\nprovisions, embedded in the soft roads, had not been able to arrive by\nmorning; the soldiers had had no sleep; they were wet and fasting. This\ndid not prevent Napoleon from exclaiming cheerfully to Ney, “We have\nninety chances out of a hundred.” At eight o’clock the Emperor’s\nbreakfast was brought to him. He invited many generals to it. During\nbreakfast, it was said that Wellington had been to a ball two nights\nbefore, in Brussels, at the Duchess of Richmond’s; and Soult, a rough\nman of war, with a face of an archbishop, said, “The ball takes place\nto-day.” The Emperor jested with Ney, who said, “Wellington will not be\nso simple as to wait for Your Majesty.” That was his way, however. “He\nwas fond of jesting,” says Fleury de Chaboulon. “A merry humor was at\nthe foundation of his character,” says Gourgaud. “He abounded in\npleasantries, which were more peculiar than witty,” says Benjamin\nConstant. These gayeties of a giant are worthy of insistence. It was he\nwho called his grenadiers “his grumblers”; he pinched their ears; he\npulled their moustaches. “The Emperor did nothing but play pranks on\nus,” is the remark of one of them. During the mysterious trip from the\nisland of Elba to France, on the 27th of February, on the open sea, the\nFrench brig of war, _Le Zéphyr_, having encountered the brig\n_L’Inconstant_, on which Napoleon was concealed, and having asked the\nnews of Napoleon from _L’Inconstant_, the Emperor, who still wore in\nhis hat the white and amaranthine cockade sown with bees, which he had\nadopted at the isle of Elba, laughingly seized the speaking-trumpet,\nand answered for himself, “The Emperor is well.” A man who laughs like\nthat is on familiar terms with events. Napoleon indulged in many fits\nof this laughter during the breakfast at Waterloo. After breakfast he\nmeditated for a quarter of an hour; then two generals seated themselves\non the truss of straw, pen in hand and their paper on their knees, and\nthe Emperor dictated to them the order of battle.\n\nAt nine o’clock, at the instant when the French army, ranged in\nechelons and set in motion in five columns, had deployed—the divisions\nin two lines, the artillery between the brigades, the music at their\nhead; as they beat the march, with rolls on the drums and the blasts of\ntrumpets, mighty, vast, joyous, a sea of casques, of sabres, and of\nbayonets on the horizon, the Emperor was touched, and twice exclaimed,\n“Magnificent! Magnificent!”\n\n\nBetween nine o’clock and half-past ten the whole army, incredible as it\nmay appear, had taken up its position and ranged itself in six lines,\nforming, to repeat the Emperor’s expression, “the figure of six V’s.” A\nfew moments after the formation of the battle-array, in the midst of\nthat profound silence, like that which heralds the beginning of a\nstorm, which precedes engagements, the Emperor tapped Haxo on the\nshoulder, as he beheld the three batteries of twelve-pounders, detached\nby his orders from the corps of Erlon, Reille, and Lobau, and destined\nto begin the action by taking Mont-Saint-Jean, which was situated at\nthe intersection of the Nivelles and the Genappe roads, and said to\nhim, “There are four and twenty handsome maids, General.”\n\n\nSure of the issue, he encouraged with a smile, as they passed before\nhim, the company of sappers of the first corps, which he had appointed\nto barricade Mont-Saint-Jean as soon as the village should be carried.\nAll this serenity had been traversed by but a single word of haughty\npity; perceiving on his left, at a spot where there now stands a large\ntomb, those admirable Scotch Grays, with their superb horses, massing\nthemselves, he said, “It is a pity.”\n\n\nThen he mounted his horse, advanced beyond Rossomme, and selected for\nhis post of observation a contracted elevation of turf to the right of\nthe road from Genappe to Brussels, which was his second station during\nthe battle. The third station, the one adopted at seven o’clock in the\nevening, between La Belle-Alliance and La Haie-Sainte, is formidable;\nit is a rather elevated knoll, which still exists, and behind which the\nguard was massed on a slope of the plain. Around this knoll the balls\nrebounded from the pavements of the road, up to Napoleon himself. As at\nBrienne, he had over his head the shriek of the bullets and of the\nheavy artillery. Mouldy cannon-balls, old sword-blades, and shapeless\nprojectiles, eaten up with rust, were picked up at the spot where his\nhorse’s feet stood. _Scabra rubigine_. A few years ago, a shell of\nsixty pounds, still charged, and with its fuse broken off level with\nthe bomb, was unearthed. It was at this last post that the Emperor said\nto his guide, Lacoste, a hostile and terrified peasant, who was\nattached to the saddle of a hussar, and who turned round at every\ndischarge of canister and tried to hide behind Napoleon: “Fool, it is\nshameful! You’ll get yourself killed with a ball in the back.” He who\nwrites these lines has himself found, in the friable soil of this\nknoll, on turning over the sand, the remains of the neck of a bomb,\ndisintegrated, by the oxidization of six and forty years, and old\nfragments of iron which parted like elder-twigs between the fingers.\n\nEvery one is aware that the variously inclined undulations of the\nplains, where the engagement between Napoleon and Wellington took\nplace, are no longer what they were on June 18, 1815. By taking from\nthis mournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it, its real\nrelief has been taken away, and history, disconcerted, no longer finds\nher bearings there. It has been disfigured for the sake of glorifying\nit. Wellington, when he beheld Waterloo once more, two years later,\nexclaimed, “They have altered my field of battle!” Where the great\npyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, rises to-day, there was a\nhillock which descended in an easy slope towards the Nivelles road, but\nwhich was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to Genappe.\nThe elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of\nthe two knolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from\nGenappe to Brussels: one, the English tomb, is on the left; the other,\nthe German tomb, is on the right. There is no French tomb. The whole of\nthat plain is a sepulchre for France. Thanks to the thousands upon\nthousands of cartloads of earth employed in the hillock one hundred and\nfifty feet in height and half a mile in circumference, the plateau of\nMont-Saint-Jean is now accessible by an easy slope. On the day of\nbattle, particularly on the side of La Haie-Sainte, it was abrupt and\ndifficult of approach. The slope there is so steep that the English\ncannon could not see the farm, situated in the bottom of the valley,\nwhich was the centre of the combat. On the 18th of June, 1815, the\nrains had still farther increased this acclivity, the mud complicated\nthe problem of the ascent, and the men not only slipped back, but stuck\nfast in the mire. Along the crest of the plateau ran a sort of trench\nwhose presence it was impossible for the distant observer to divine.\n\nWhat was this trench? Let us explain. Braine-l’Alleud is a Belgian\nvillage; Ohain is another. These villages, both of them concealed in\ncurves of the landscape, are connected by a road about a league and a\nhalf in length, which traverses the plain along its undulating level,\nand often enters and buries itself in the hills like a furrow, which\nmakes a ravine of this road in some places. In 1815, as at the present\nday, this road cut the crest of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean between\nthe two highways from Genappe and Nivelles; only, it is now on a level\nwith the plain; it was then a hollow way. Its two slopes have been\nappropriated for the monumental hillock. This road was, and still is, a\ntrench throughout the greater portion of its course; a hollow trench,\nsometimes a dozen feet in depth, and whose banks, being too steep,\ncrumbled away here and there, particularly in winter, under driving\nrains. Accidents happened here. The road was so narrow at the\nBraine-l’Alleud entrance that a passer-by was crushed by a cart, as is\nproved by a stone cross which stands near the cemetery, and which gives\nthe name of the dead, _Monsieur Bernard Debrye, Merchant of Brussels_,\nand the date of the accident, _February, 1637_.8 It was so deep on the\ntable-land of Mont-Saint-Jean that a peasant, Mathieu Nicaise, was\ncrushed there, in 1783, by a slide from the slope, as is stated on\nanother stone cross, the top of which has disappeared in the process of\nclearing the ground, but whose overturned pedestal is still visible on\nthe grassy slope to the left of the highway between La Haie-Sainte and\nthe farm of Mont-Saint-Jean.\n\nOn the day of battle, this hollow road whose existence was in no way\nindicated, bordering the crest of Mont-Saint-Jean, a trench at the\nsummit of the escarpment, a rut concealed in the soil, was invisible;\nthat is to say, terrible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—THE EMPEROR PUTS A QUESTION TO THE GUIDE LACOSTE\n\n\nSo, on the morning of Waterloo, Napoleon was content.\n\nHe was right; the plan of battle conceived by him was, as we have seen,\nreally admirable.\n\nThe battle once begun, its very various changes,—the resistance of\nHougomont; the tenacity of La Haie-Sainte; the killing of Bauduin; the\ndisabling of Foy; the unexpected wall against which Soye’s brigade was\nshattered; Guilleminot’s fatal heedlessness when he had neither petard\nnor powder sacks; the miring of the batteries; the fifteen unescorted\npieces overwhelmed in a hollow way by Uxbridge; the small effect of the\nbombs falling in the English lines, and there embedding themselves in\nthe rain-soaked soil, and only succeeding in producing volcanoes of\nmud, so that the canister was turned into a splash; the uselessness of\nPiré‘s demonstration on Braine-l’Alleud; all that cavalry, fifteen\nsquadrons, almost exterminated; the right wing of the English badly\nalarmed, the left wing badly cut into; Ney’s strange mistake in\nmassing, instead of echelonning the four divisions of the first corps;\nmen delivered over to grape-shot, arranged in ranks twenty-seven deep\nand with a frontage of two hundred; the frightful holes made in these\nmasses by the cannon-balls; attacking columns disorganized; the\nside-battery suddenly unmasked on their flank; Bourgeois, Donzelot, and\nDurutte compromised; Quiot repulsed; Lieutenant Vieux, that Hercules\ngraduated at the Polytechnic School, wounded at the moment when he was\nbeating in with an axe the door of La Haie-Sainte under the downright\nfire of the English barricade which barred the angle of the road from\nGenappe to Brussels; Marcognet’s division caught between the infantry\nand the cavalry, shot down at the very muzzle of the guns amid the\ngrain by Best and Pack, put to the sword by Ponsonby; his battery of\nseven pieces spiked; the Prince of Saxe-Weimar holding and guarding, in\nspite of the Comte d’Erlon, both Frischemont and Smohain; the flag of\nthe 105th taken, the flag of the 45th captured; that black Prussian\nhussar stopped by runners of the flying column of three hundred light\ncavalry on the scout between Wavre and Plancenoit; the alarming things\nthat had been said by prisoners; Grouchy’s delay; fifteen hundred men\nkilled in the orchard of Hougomont in less than an hour; eighteen\nhundred men overthrown in a still shorter time about La\nHaie-Sainte,—all these stormy incidents passing like the clouds of\nbattle before Napoleon, had hardly troubled his gaze and had not\novershadowed that face of imperial certainty. Napoleon was accustomed\nto gaze steadily at war; he never added up the heart-rending details,\ncipher by cipher; ciphers mattered little to him, provided that they\nfurnished the total—victory; he was not alarmed if the beginnings did\ngo astray, since he thought himself the master and the possessor at the\nend; he knew how to wait, supposing himself to be out of the question,\nand he treated destiny as his equal: he seemed to say to fate, Thou\nwilt not dare.\n\nComposed half of light and half of shadow, Napoleon thought himself\nprotected in good and tolerated in evil. He had, or thought that he\nhad, a connivance, one might almost say a complicity, of events in his\nfavor, which was equivalent to the invulnerability of antiquity.\n\nNevertheless, when one has Bérésina, Leipzig, and Fontainebleau behind\none, it seems as though one might distrust Waterloo. A mysterious frown\nbecomes perceptible in the depths of the heavens.\n\nAt the moment when Wellington retreated, Napoleon shuddered. He\nsuddenly beheld the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean cleared, and the van\nof the English army disappear. It was rallying, but hiding itself. The\nEmperor half rose in his stirrups. The lightning of victory flashed\nfrom his eyes.\n\nWellington, driven into a corner at the forest of Soignes and\ndestroyed—that was the definitive conquest of England by France; it was\nCrécy, Poitiers, Malplaquet, and Ramillies avenged. The man of Marengo\nwas wiping out Agincourt.\n\nSo the Emperor, meditating on this terrible turn of fortune, swept his\nglass for the last time over all the points of the field of battle. His\nguard, standing behind him with grounded arms, watched him from below\nwith a sort of religion. He pondered; he examined the slopes, noted the\ndeclivities, scrutinized the clumps of trees, the square of rye, the\npath; he seemed to be counting each bush. He gazed with some intentness\nat the English barricades of the two highways,—two large abatis of\ntrees, that on the road to Genappe above La Haie-Sainte, armed with two\ncannon, the only ones out of all the English artillery which commanded\nthe extremity of the field of battle, and that on the road to Nivelles\nwhere gleamed the Dutch bayonets of Chassé‘s brigade. Near this\nbarricade he observed the old chapel of Saint Nicholas, painted white,\nwhich stands at the angle of the crossroad near Braine-l’Alleud; he\nbent down and spoke in a low voice to the guide Lacoste. The guide made\na negative sign with his head, which was probably perfidious.\n\nThe Emperor straightened himself up and fell to thinking.\n\nWellington had drawn back.\n\nAll that remained to do was to complete this retreat by crushing him.\n\nNapoleon turning round abruptly, despatched an express at full speed to\nParis to announce that the battle was won.\n\nNapoleon was one of those geniuses from whom thunder darts.\n\nHe had just found his clap of thunder.\n\nHe gave orders to Milhaud’s cuirassiers to carry the table-land of\nMont-Saint-Jean.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—THE UNEXPECTED\n\n\nThere were three thousand five hundred of them. They formed a front a\nquarter of a league in extent. They were giant men, on colossal horses.\nThere were six and twenty squadrons of them; and they had behind them\nto support them Lefebvre-Desnouettes’s division,—the one hundred and\nsix picked gendarmes, the light cavalry of the Guard, eleven hundred\nand ninety-seven men, and the lancers of the guard of eight hundred and\neighty lances. They wore casques without horse-tails, and cuirasses of\nbeaten iron, with horse-pistols in their holsters, and long\nsabre-swords. That morning the whole army had admired them, when, at\nnine o’clock, with braying of trumpets and all the music playing “Let\nus watch o’er the Safety of the Empire,” they had come in a solid\ncolumn, with one of their batteries on their flank, another in their\ncentre, and deployed in two ranks between the roads to Genappe and\nFrischemont, and taken up their position for battle in that powerful\nsecond line, so cleverly arranged by Napoleon, which, having on its\nextreme left Kellermann’s cuirassiers and on its extreme right\nMilhaud’s cuirassiers, had, so to speak, two wings of iron.\n\nAide-de-camp Bernard carried them the Emperor’s orders. Ney drew his\nsword and placed himself at their head. The enormous squadrons were set\nin motion.\n\nThen a formidable spectacle was seen.\n\nAll their cavalry, with upraised swords, standards and trumpets flung\nto the breeze, formed in columns by divisions, descended, by a\nsimultaneous movement and like one man, with the precision of a brazen\nbattering-ram which is effecting a breach, the hill of La Belle\nAlliance, plunged into the terrible depths in which so many men had\nalready fallen, disappeared there in the smoke, then emerging from that\nshadow, reappeared on the other side of the valley, still compact and\nin close ranks, mounting at a full trot, through a storm of grape-shot\nwhich burst upon them, the terrible muddy slope of the table-land of\nMont-Saint-Jean. They ascended, grave, threatening, imperturbable; in\nthe intervals between the musketry and the artillery, their colossal\ntrampling was audible. Being two divisions, there were two columns of\nthem; Wathier’s division held the right, Delort’s division was on the\nleft. It seemed as though two immense adders of steel were to be seen\ncrawling towards the crest of the table-land. It traversed the battle\nlike a prodigy.\n\nNothing like it had been seen since the taking of the great redoubt of\nthe Muskowa by the heavy cavalry; Murat was lacking here, but Ney was\nagain present. It seemed as though that mass had become a monster and\nhad but one soul. Each column undulated and swelled like the ring of a\npolyp. They could be seen through a vast cloud of smoke which was rent\nhere and there. A confusion of helmets, of cries, of sabres, a stormy\nheaving of the cruppers of horses amid the cannons and the flourish of\ntrumpets, a terrible and disciplined tumult; over all, the cuirasses\nlike the scales on the hydra.\n\nThese narrations seemed to belong to another age. Something parallel to\nthis vision appeared, no doubt, in the ancient Orphic epics, which told\nof the centaurs, the old hippanthropes, those Titans with human heads\nand equestrian chests who scaled Olympus at a gallop, horrible,\ninvulnerable, sublime—gods and beasts.\n\nOdd numerical coincidence,—twenty-six battalions rode to meet\ntwenty-six battalions. Behind the crest of the plateau, in the shadow\nof the masked battery, the English infantry, formed into thirteen\nsquares, two battalions to the square, in two lines, with seven in the\nfirst line, six in the second, the stocks of their guns to their\nshoulders, taking aim at that which was on the point of appearing,\nwaited, calm, mute, motionless. They did not see the cuirassiers, and\nthe cuirassiers did not see them. They listened to the rise of this\nflood of men. They heard the swelling noise of three thousand horse,\nthe alternate and symmetrical tramp of their hoofs at full trot, the\njingling of the cuirasses, the clang of the sabres and a sort of grand\nand savage breathing. There ensued a most terrible silence; then, all\nat once, a long file of uplifted arms, brandishing sabres, appeared\nabove the crest, and casques, trumpets, and standards, and three\nthousand heads with gray moustaches, shouting, “Vive l’Empereur!” All\nthis cavalry debouched on the plateau, and it was like the appearance\nof an earthquake.\n\nAll at once, a tragic incident; on the English left, on our right, the\nhead of the column of cuirassiers reared up with a frightful clamor. On\narriving at the culminating point of the crest, ungovernable, utterly\ngiven over to fury and their course of extermination of the squares and\ncannon, the cuirassiers had just caught sight of a trench,—a trench\nbetween them and the English. It was the hollow road of Ohain.\n\nIt was a terrible moment. The ravine was there, unexpected, yawning,\ndirectly under the horses’ feet, two fathoms deep between its double\nslopes; the second file pushed the first into it, and the third pushed\non the second; the horses reared and fell backward, landed on their\nhaunches, slid down, all four feet in the air, crushing and\noverwhelming the riders; and there being no means of retreat,—the whole\ncolumn being no longer anything more than a projectile,—the force which\nhad been acquired to crush the English crushed the French; the\ninexorable ravine could only yield when filled; horses and riders\nrolled there pell-mell, grinding each other, forming but one mass of\nflesh in this gulf: when this trench was full of living men, the rest\nmarched over them and passed on. Almost a third of Dubois’s brigade\nfell into that abyss.\n\nThis began the loss of the battle.\n\nA local tradition, which evidently exaggerates matters, says that two\nthousand horses and fifteen hundred men were buried in the hollow road\nof Ohain. This figure probably comprises all the other corpses which\nwere flung into this ravine the day after the combat.\n\nLet us note in passing that it was Dubois’s sorely tried brigade which,\nan hour previously, making a charge to one side, had captured the flag\nof the Lunenburg battalion.\n\nNapoleon, before giving the order for this charge of Milhaud’s\ncuirassiers, had scrutinized the ground, but had not been able to see\nthat hollow road, which did not even form a wrinkle on the surface of\nthe plateau. Warned, nevertheless, and put on the alert by the little\nwhite chapel which marks its angle of junction with the Nivelles\nhighway, he had probably put a question as to the possibility of an\nobstacle, to the guide Lacoste. The guide had answered No. We might\nalmost affirm that Napoleon’s catastrophe originated in that sign of a\npeasant’s head.\n\nOther fatalities were destined to arise.\n\nWas it possible that Napoleon should have won that battle? We answer\nNo. Why? Because of Wellington? Because of Blücher? No. Because of God.\n\nBonaparte victor at Waterloo; that does not come within the law of the\nnineteenth century. Another series of facts was in preparation, in\nwhich there was no longer any room for Napoleon. The ill will of events\nhad declared itself long before.\n\nIt was time that this vast man should fall.\n\nThe excessive weight of this man in human destiny disturbed the\nbalance. This individual alone counted for more than a universal group.\nThese plethoras of all human vitality concentrated in a single head;\nthe world mounting to the brain of one man,—this would be mortal to\ncivilization were it to last. The moment had arrived for the\nincorruptible and supreme equity to alter its plan. Probably the\nprinciples and the elements, on which the regular gravitations of the\nmoral, as of the material, world depend, had complained. Smoking blood,\nover-filled cemeteries, mothers in tears,—these are formidable\npleaders. When the earth is suffering from too heavy a burden, there\nare mysterious groanings of the shades, to which the abyss lends an\near.\n\nNapoleon had been denounced in the infinite and his fall had been\ndecided on.\n\nHe embarrassed God.\n\nWaterloo is not a battle; it is a change of front on the part of the\nUniverse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X—THE PLATEAU OF MONT-SAINT-JEAN\n\n\nThe battery was unmasked at the same moment with the ravine.\n\nSixty cannons and the thirteen squares darted lightning point-blank on\nthe cuirassiers. The intrepid General Delort made the military salute\nto the English battery.\n\nThe whole of the flying artillery of the English had re-entered the\nsquares at a gallop. The cuirassiers had not had even the time for a\nhalt. The disaster of the hollow road had decimated, but not\ndiscouraged them. They belonged to that class of men who, when\ndiminished in number, increase in courage.\n\nWathier’s column alone had suffered in the disaster; Delort’s column,\nwhich Ney had deflected to the left, as though he had a presentiment of\nan ambush, had arrived whole.\n\nThe cuirassiers hurled themselves on the English squares.\n\nAt full speed, with bridles loose, swords in their teeth, pistols in\nfist,—such was the attack.\n\nThere are moments in battles in which the soul hardens the man until\nthe soldier is changed into a statue, and when all this flesh turns\ninto granite. The English battalions, desperately assaulted, did not\nstir.\n\nThen it was terrible.\n\nAll the faces of the English squares were attacked at once. A frenzied\nwhirl enveloped them. That cold infantry remained impassive. The first\nrank knelt and received the cuirassiers on their bayonets, the second\nranks shot them down; behind the second rank the cannoneers charged\ntheir guns, the front of the square parted, permitted the passage of an\neruption of grape-shot, and closed again. The cuirassiers replied by\ncrushing them. Their great horses reared, strode across the ranks,\nleaped over the bayonets and fell, gigantic, in the midst of these four\nliving wells. The cannon-balls ploughed furrows in these cuirassiers;\nthe cuirassiers made breaches in the squares. Files of men disappeared,\nground to dust under the horses. The bayonets plunged into the bellies\nof these centaurs; hence a hideousness of wounds which has probably\nnever been seen anywhere else. The squares, wasted by this mad cavalry,\nclosed up their ranks without flinching. Inexhaustible in the matter of\ngrape-shot, they created explosions in their assailants’ midst. The\nform of this combat was monstrous. These squares were no longer\nbattalions, they were craters; those cuirassiers were no longer\ncavalry, they were a tempest. Each square was a volcano attacked by a\ncloud; lava contended with lightning.\n\nThe square on the extreme right, the most exposed of all, being in the\nair, was almost annihilated at the very first shock. lt was formed of\nthe 75th regiment of Highlanders. The bagpipe-player in the centre\ndropped his melancholy eyes, filled with the reflections of the forests\nand the lakes, in profound inattention, while men were being\nexterminated around him, and seated on a drum, with his pibroch under\nhis arm, played the Highland airs. These Scotchmen died thinking of Ben\nLothian, as did the Greeks recalling Argos. The sword of a cuirassier,\nwhich hewed down the bagpipes and the arm which bore it, put an end to\nthe song by killing the singer.\n\nThe cuirassiers, relatively few in number, and still further diminished\nby the catastrophe of the ravine, had almost the whole English army\nagainst them, but they multiplied themselves so that each man of them\nwas equal to ten. Nevertheless, some Hanoverian battalions yielded.\nWellington perceived it, and thought of his cavalry. Had Napoleon at\nthat same moment thought of his infantry, he would have won the battle.\nThis forgetfulness was his great and fatal mistake.\n\nAll at once, the cuirassiers, who had been the assailants, found\nthemselves assailed. The English cavalry was at their back. Before them\ntwo squares, behind them Somerset; Somerset meant fourteen hundred\ndragoons of the guard. On the right, Somerset had Dornberg with the\nGerman light-horse, and on his left, Trip with the Belgian carabineers;\nthe cuirassiers attacked on the flank and in front, before and in the\nrear, by infantry and cavalry, had to face all sides. What mattered it\nto them? They were a whirlwind. Their valor was something\nindescribable.\n\nIn addition to this, they had behind them the battery, which was still\nthundering. It was necessary that it should be so, or they could never\nhave been wounded in the back. One of their cuirasses, pierced on the\nshoulder by a ball from a biscayan,9 is in the collection of the\nWaterloo Museum.\n\nFor such Frenchmen nothing less than such Englishmen was needed. It was\nno longer a hand-to-hand conflict; it was a shadow, a fury, a dizzy\ntransport of souls and courage, a hurricane of lightning swords. In an\ninstant the fourteen hundred dragoon guards numbered only eight\nhundred. Fuller, their lieutenant-colonel, fell dead. Ney rushed up\nwith the lancers and Lefebvre-Desnouettes’s light-horse. The plateau of\nMont-Saint-Jean was captured, recaptured, captured again. The\ncuirassiers quitted the cavalry to return to the infantry; or, to put\nit more exactly, the whole of that formidable rout collared each other\nwithout releasing the other. The squares still held firm.\n\nThere were a dozen assaults. Ney had four horses killed under him. Half\nthe cuirassiers remained on the plateau. This conflict lasted two\nhours.\n\nThe English army was profoundly shaken. There is no doubt that, had\nthey not been enfeebled in their first shock by the disaster of the\nhollow road the cuirassiers would have overwhelmed the centre and\ndecided the victory. This extraordinary cavalry petrified Clinton, who\nhad seen Talavera and Badajoz. Wellington, three-quarters vanquished,\nadmired heroically. He said in an undertone, “Sublime!”\n\n\nThe cuirassiers annihilated seven squares out of thirteen, took or\nspiked sixty pieces of ordnance, and captured from the English\nregiments six flags, which three cuirassiers and three chasseurs of the\nGuard bore to the Emperor, in front of the farm of La Belle Alliance.\n\nWellington’s situation had grown worse. This strange battle was like a\nduel between two raging, wounded men, each of whom, still fighting and\nstill resisting, is expending all his blood.\n\nWhich of the two will be the first to fall?\n\nThe conflict on the plateau continued.\n\nWhat had become of the cuirassiers? No one could have told. One thing\nis certain, that on the day after the battle, a cuirassier and his\nhorse were found dead among the woodwork of the scales for vehicles at\nMont-Saint-Jean, at the very point where the four roads from Nivelles,\nGenappe, La Hulpe, and Brussels meet and intersect each other. This\nhorseman had pierced the English lines. One of the men who picked up\nthe body still lives at Mont-Saint-Jean. His name is Dehaze. He was\neighteen years old at that time.\n\nWellington felt that he was yielding. The crisis was at hand.\n\nThe cuirassiers had not succeeded, since the centre was not broken\nthrough. As every one was in possession of the plateau, no one held it,\nand in fact it remained, to a great extent, with the English.\nWellington held the village and the culminating plain; Ney had only the\ncrest and the slope. They seemed rooted in that fatal soil on both\nsides.\n\nBut the weakening of the English seemed irremediable. The bleeding of\nthat army was horrible. Kempt, on the left wing, demanded\nreinforcements. “There are none,” replied Wellington; “he must let\nhimself be killed!” Almost at that same moment, a singular coincidence\nwhich paints the exhaustion of the two armies, Ney demanded infantry\nfrom Napoleon, and Napoleon exclaimed, “Infantry! Where does he expect\nme to get it? Does he think I can make it?”\n\n\nNevertheless, the English army was in the worse case of the two. The\nfurious onsets of those great squadrons with cuirasses of iron and\nbreasts of steel had ground the infantry to nothing. A few men\nclustered round a flag marked the post of a regiment; such and such a\nbattalion was commanded only by a captain or a lieutenant; Alten’s\ndivision, already so roughly handled at La Haie-Sainte, was almost\ndestroyed; the intrepid Belgians of Van Kluze’s brigade strewed the\nrye-fields all along the Nivelles road; hardly anything was left of\nthose Dutch grenadiers, who, intermingled with Spaniards in our ranks\nin 1811, fought against Wellington; and who, in 1815, rallied to the\nEnglish standard, fought against Napoleon. The loss in officers was\nconsiderable. Lord Uxbridge, who had his leg buried on the following\nday, had his knee shattered. If, on the French side, in that tussle of\nthe cuirassiers, Delort, l’Héritier, Colbert, Dnop, Travers, and\nBlancard were disabled, on the side of the English there was Alten\nwounded, Barne wounded, Delancey killed, Van Meeren killed, Ompteda\nkilled, the whole of Wellington’s staff decimated, and England had the\nworse of it in that bloody scale. The second regiment of foot-guards\nhad lost five lieutenant-colonels, four captains, and three ensigns;\nthe first battalion of the 30th infantry had lost 24 officers and 1,200\nsoldiers; the 79th Highlanders had lost 24 officers wounded, 18\nofficers killed, 450 soldiers killed. The Hanoverian hussars of\nCumberland, a whole regiment, with Colonel Hacke at its head, who was\ndestined to be tried later on and cashiered, had turned bridle in the\npresence of the fray, and had fled to the forest of Soignes, sowing\ndefeat all the way to Brussels. The transports, ammunition-wagons, the\nbaggage-wagons, the wagons filled with wounded, on perceiving that the\nFrench were gaining ground and approaching the forest, rushed headlong\nthither. The Dutch, mowed down by the French cavalry, cried, “Alarm!”\nFrom Vert-Coucou to Groenendael, for a distance of nearly two leagues\nin the direction of Brussels, according to the testimony of\neye-witnesses who are still alive, the roads were encumbered with\nfugitives. This panic was such that it attacked the Prince de Condé at\nMechlin, and Louis XVIII. at Ghent. With the exception of the feeble\nreserve echelonned behind the ambulance established at the farm of\nMont-Saint-Jean, and of Vivian’s and Vandeleur’s brigades, which\nflanked the left wing, Wellington had no cavalry left. A number of\nbatteries lay unhorsed. These facts are attested by Siborne; and\nPringle, exaggerating the disaster, goes so far as to say that the\nAnglo-Dutch army was reduced to thirty-four thousand men. The Iron Duke\nremained calm, but his lips blanched. Vincent, the Austrian\ncommissioner, Alava, the Spanish commissioner, who were present at the\nbattle in the English staff, thought the Duke lost. At five o’clock\nWellington drew out his watch, and he was heard to murmur these\nsinister words, “Blücher, or night!”\n\n\nIt was at about that moment that a distant line of bayonets gleamed on\nthe heights in the direction of Frischemont.\n\nHere comes the change of face in this giant drama.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI—A BAD GUIDE TO NAPOLEON; A GOOD GUIDE TO BÜLOW\n\n\nThe painful surprise of Napoleon is well known. Grouchy hoped for,\nBlücher arriving. Death instead of life.\n\nFate has these turns; the throne of the world was expected; it was\nSaint Helena that was seen.\n\nIf the little shepherd who served as guide to Bülow, Blücher’s\nlieutenant, had advised him to debouch from the forest above\nFrischemont, instead of below Plancenoit, the form of the nineteenth\ncentury might, perhaps, have been different. Napoleon would have won\nthe battle of Waterloo. By any other route than that below Plancenoit,\nthe Prussian army would have come out upon a ravine impassable for\nartillery, and Bülow would not have arrived.\n\nNow the Prussian general, Muffling, declares that one hour’s delay, and\nBlücher would not have found Wellington on his feet. “The battle was\nlost.”\n\n\nIt was time that Bülow should arrive, as will be seen. He had,\nmoreover, been very much delayed. He had bivouacked at Dion-le-Mont,\nand had set out at daybreak; but the roads were impassable, and his\ndivisions stuck fast in the mire. The ruts were up to the hubs of the\ncannons. Moreover, he had been obliged to pass the Dyle on the narrow\nbridge of Wavre; the street leading to the bridge had been fired by the\nFrench, so the caissons and ammunition-wagons could not pass between\ntwo rows of burning houses, and had been obliged to wait until the\nconflagration was extinguished. It was midday before Bülow’s vanguard\nhad been able to reach Chapelle-Saint-Lambert.\n\nHad the action been begun two hours earlier, it would have been over at\nfour o’clock, and Blücher would have fallen on the battle won by\nNapoleon. Such are these immense risks proportioned to an infinite\nwhich we cannot comprehend.\n\nThe Emperor had been the first, as early as midday, to descry with his\nfield-glass, on the extreme horizon, something which had attracted his\nattention. He had said, “I see yonder a cloud, which seems to me to be\ntroops.” Then he asked the Duc de Dalmatie, “Soult, what do you see in\nthe direction of Chapelle-Saint-Lambert?” The marshal, levelling his\nglass, answered, “Four or five thousand men, Sire; evidently Grouchy.”\nBut it remained motionless in the mist. All the glasses of the staff\nhad studied “the cloud” pointed out by the Emperor. Some said: “It is\ntrees.” The truth is, that the cloud did not move. The Emperor detached\nDomon’s division of light cavalry to reconnoitre in that quarter.\n\nBülow had not moved, in fact. His vanguard was very feeble, and could\naccomplish nothing. He was obliged to wait for the body of the army\ncorps, and he had received orders to concentrate his forces before\nentering into line; but at five o’clock, perceiving Wellington’s peril,\nBlücher ordered Bülow to attack, and uttered these remarkable words:\n“We must give air to the English army.”\n\n\nA little later, the divisions of Losthin, Hiller, Hacke, and Ryssel\ndeployed before Lobau’s corps, the cavalry of Prince William of Prussia\ndebouched from the forest of Paris, Plancenoit was in flames, and the\nPrussian cannon-balls began to rain even upon the ranks of the guard in\nreserve behind Napoleon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII—THE GUARD\n\n\nEvery one knows the rest,—the irruption of a third army; the battle\nbroken to pieces; eighty-six mouths of fire thundering simultaneously;\nPirch the first coming up with Bülow; Zieten’s cavalry led by Blücher\nin person, the French driven back; Marcognet swept from the plateau of\nOhain; Durutte dislodged from Papelotte; Donzelot and Quiot retreating;\nLobau caught on the flank; a fresh battle precipitating itself on our\ndismantled regiments at nightfall; the whole English line resuming the\noffensive and thrust forward; the gigantic breach made in the French\narmy; the English grape-shot and the Prussian grape-shot aiding each\nother; the extermination; disaster in front; disaster on the flank; the\nGuard entering the line in the midst of this terrible crumbling of all\nthings.\n\nConscious that they were about to die, they shouted, “Vive l’Empereur!”\nHistory records nothing more touching than that agony bursting forth in\nacclamations.\n\nThe sky had been overcast all day long. All of a sudden, at that very\nmoment,—it was eight o’clock in the evening—the clouds on the horizon\nparted, and allowed the grand and sinister glow of the setting sun to\npass through, athwart the elms on the Nivelles road. They had seen it\nrise at Austerlitz.\n\nEach battalion of the Guard was commanded by a general for this final\ncatastrophe. Friant, Michel, Roguet, Harlet, Mallet, Poret de Morvan,\nwere there. When the tall caps of the grenadiers of the Guard, with\ntheir large plaques bearing the eagle appeared, symmetrical, in line,\ntranquil, in the midst of that combat, the enemy felt a respect for\nFrance; they thought they beheld twenty victories entering the field of\nbattle, with wings outspread, and those who were the conquerors,\nbelieving themselves to be vanquished, retreated; but Wellington\nshouted, “Up, Guards, and aim straight!” The red regiment of English\nguards, lying flat behind the hedges, sprang up, a cloud of grape-shot\nriddled the tricolored flag and whistled round our eagles; all hurled\nthemselves forwards, and the final carnage began. In the darkness, the\nImperial Guard felt the army losing ground around it, and in the vast\nshock of the rout it heard the desperate flight which had taken the\nplace of the “Vive l’Empereur!” and, with flight behind it, it\ncontinued to advance, more crushed, losing more men at every step that\nit took. There were none who hesitated, no timid men in its ranks. The\nsoldier in that troop was as much of a hero as the general. Not a man\nwas missing in that suicide.\n\nNey, bewildered, great with all the grandeur of accepted death, offered\nhimself to all blows in that tempest. He had his fifth horse killed\nunder him there. Perspiring, his eyes aflame, foaming at the mouth,\nwith uniform unbuttoned, one of his epaulets half cut off by a\nsword-stroke from a horseguard, his plaque with the great eagle dented\nby a bullet; bleeding, bemired, magnificent, a broken sword in his\nhand, he said, “Come and see how a Marshal of France dies on the field\nof battle!” But in vain; he did not die. He was haggard and angry. At\nDrouet d’Erlon he hurled this question, “Are you not going to get\nyourself killed?” In the midst of all that artillery engaged in\ncrushing a handful of men, he shouted: “So there is nothing for me! Oh!\nI should like to have all these English bullets enter my bowels!”\nUnhappy man, thou wert reserved for French bullets!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII—THE CATASTROPHE\n\n\nThe rout behind the Guard was melancholy.\n\nThe army yielded suddenly on all sides at once,—Hougomont, La\nHaie-Sainte, Papelotte, Plancenoit. The cry “Treachery!” was followed\nby a cry of “Save yourselves who can!” An army which is disbanding is\nlike a thaw. All yields, splits, cracks, floats, rolls, falls, jostles,\nhastens, is precipitated. The disintegration is unprecedented. Ney\nborrows a horse, leaps upon it, and without hat, cravat, or sword,\nplaces himself across the Brussels road, stopping both English and\nFrench. He strives to detain the army, he recalls it to its duty, he\ninsults it, he clings to the rout. He is overwhelmed. The soldiers fly\nfrom him, shouting, “Long live Marshal Ney!” Two of Durutte’s regiments\ngo and come in affright as though tossed back and forth between the\nswords of the Uhlans and the fusillade of the brigades of Kempt, Best,\nPack, and Rylandt; the worst of hand-to-hand conflicts is the defeat;\nfriends kill each other in order to escape; squadrons and battalions\nbreak and disperse against each other, like the tremendous foam of\nbattle. Lobau at one extremity, and Reille at the other, are drawn into\nthe tide. In vain does Napoleon erect walls from what is left to him of\nhis Guard; in vain does he expend in a last effort his last serviceable\nsquadrons. Quiot retreats before Vivian, Kellermann before Vandeleur,\nLobau before Bülow, Morand before Pirch, Domon and Subervic before\nPrince William of Prussia; Guyot, who led the Emperor’s squadrons to\nthe charge, falls beneath the feet of the English dragoons. Napoleon\ngallops past the line of fugitives, harangues, urges, threatens,\nentreats them. All the mouths which in the morning had shouted, “Long\nlive the Emperor!” remain gaping; they hardly recognize him. The\nPrussian cavalry, newly arrived, dashes forwards, flies, hews, slashes,\nkills, exterminates. Horses lash out, the cannons flee; the soldiers of\nthe artillery-train unharness the caissons and use the horses to make\ntheir escape; transports overturned, with all four wheels in the air,\nclog the road and occasion massacres. Men are crushed, trampled down,\nothers walk over the dead and the living. Arms are lost. A dizzy\nmultitude fills the roads, the paths, the bridges, the plains, the\nhills, the valleys, the woods, encumbered by this invasion of forty\nthousand men. Shouts despair, knapsacks and guns flung among the rye,\npassages forced at the point of the sword, no more comrades, no more\nofficers, no more generals, an inexpressible terror. Zieten putting\nFrance to the sword at its leisure. Lions converted into goats. Such\nwas the flight.\n\nAt Genappe, an effort was made to wheel about, to present a battle\nfront, to draw up in line. Lobau rallied three hundred men. The\nentrance to the village was barricaded, but at the first volley of\nPrussian canister, all took to flight again, and Lobau was taken. That\nvolley of grape-shot can be seen to-day imprinted on the ancient gable\nof a brick building on the right of the road at a few minutes’ distance\nbefore you enter Genappe. The Prussians threw themselves into Genappe,\nfurious, no doubt, that they were not more entirely the conquerors. The\npursuit was stupendous. Blücher ordered extermination. Roguet had set\nthe lugubrious example of threatening with death any French grenadier\nwho should bring him a Prussian prisoner. Blücher outdid Roguet.\nDuhesme, the general of the Young Guard, hemmed in at the doorway of an\ninn at Genappe, surrendered his sword to a huzzar of death, who took\nthe sword and slew the prisoner. The victory was completed by the\nassassination of the vanquished. Let us inflict punishment, since we\nare history: old Blücher disgraced himself. This ferocity put the\nfinishing touch to the disaster. The desperate route traversed Genappe,\ntraversed Quatre-Bras, traversed Gosselies, traversed Frasnes,\ntraversed Charleroi, traversed Thuin, and only halted at the frontier.\nAlas! and who, then, was fleeing in that manner? The Grand Army.\n\nThis vertigo, this terror, this downfall into ruin of the loftiest\nbravery which ever astounded history,—is that causeless? No. The shadow\nof an enormous right is projected athwart Waterloo. It is the day of\ndestiny. The force which is mightier than man produced that day. Hence\nthe terrified wrinkle of those brows; hence all those great souls\nsurrendering their swords. Those who had conquered Europe have fallen\nprone on the earth, with nothing left to say nor to do, feeling the\npresent shadow of a terrible presence. _Hoc erat in fatis_. That day\nthe perspective of the human race underwent a change. Waterloo is the\nhinge of the nineteenth century. The disappearance of the great man was\nnecessary to the advent of the great century. Some one, a person to\nwhom one replies not, took the responsibility on himself. The panic of\nheroes can be explained. In the battle of Waterloo there is something\nmore than a cloud, there is something of the meteor. God has passed by.\n\nAt nightfall, in a meadow near Genappe, Bernard and Bertrand seized by\nthe skirt of his coat and detained a man, haggard, pensive, sinister,\ngloomy, who, dragged to that point by the current of the rout, had just\ndismounted, had passed the bridle of his horse over his arm, and with\nwild eye was returning alone to Waterloo. It was Napoleon, the immense\nsomnambulist of this dream which had crumbled, essaying once more to\nadvance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV—THE LAST SQUARE\n\n\nSeveral squares of the Guard, motionless amid this stream of the\ndefeat, as rocks in running water, held their own until night. Night\ncame, death also; they awaited that double shadow, and, invincible,\nallowed themselves to be enveloped therein. Each regiment, isolated\nfrom the rest, and having no bond with the army, now shattered in every\npart, died alone. They had taken up position for this final action,\nsome on the heights of Rossomme, others on the plain of\nMont-Saint-Jean. There, abandoned, vanquished, terrible, those gloomy\nsquares endured their death-throes in formidable fashion. Ulm, Wagram,\nJena, Friedland, died with them.\n\nAt twilight, towards nine o’clock in the evening, one of them was left\nat the foot of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean. In that fatal valley, at\nthe foot of that declivity which the cuirassiers had ascended, now\ninundated by the masses of the English, under the converging fires of\nthe victorious hostile cavalry, under a frightful density of\nprojectiles, this square fought on. It was commanded by an obscure\nofficer named Cambronne. At each discharge, the square diminished and\nreplied. It replied to the grape-shot with a fusillade, continually\ncontracting its four walls. The fugitives pausing breathless for a\nmoment in the distance, listened in the darkness to that gloomy and\never-decreasing thunder.\n\nWhen this legion had been reduced to a handful, when nothing was left\nof their flag but a rag, when their guns, the bullets all gone, were no\nlonger anything but clubs, when the heap of corpses was larger than the\ngroup of survivors, there reigned among the conquerors, around those\nmen dying so sublimely, a sort of sacred terror, and the English\nartillery, taking breath, became silent. This furnished a sort of\nrespite. These combatants had around them something in the nature of a\nswarm of spectres, silhouettes of men on horseback, the black profiles\nof cannon, the white sky viewed through wheels and gun-carriages, the\ncolossal death’s-head, which the heroes saw constantly through the\nsmoke, in the depths of the battle, advanced upon them and gazed at\nthem. Through the shades of twilight they could hear the pieces being\nloaded; the matches all lighted, like the eyes of tigers at night,\nformed a circle round their heads; all the lintstocks of the English\nbatteries approached the cannons, and then, with emotion, holding the\nsupreme moment suspended above these men, an English general, Colville\naccording to some, Maitland according to others, shouted to them,\n“Surrender, brave Frenchmen!” Cambronne replied, “——.”\n\n\n{EDITOR’S COMMENTARY: Another edition of this book has the word\n“Merde!” in lieu of the —— above.}\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV—CAMBRONNE\n\n\nIf any French reader object to having his susceptibilities offended,\none would have to refrain from repeating in his presence what is\nperhaps the finest reply that a Frenchman ever made. This would enjoin\nus from consigning something sublime to History.\n\nAt our own risk and peril, let us violate this injunction.\n\nNow, then, among those giants there was one Titan,—Cambronne.\n\nTo make that reply and then perish, what could be grander? For being\nwilling to die is the same as to die; and it was not this man’s fault\nif he survived after he was shot.\n\nThe winner of the battle of Waterloo was not Napoleon, who was put to\nflight; nor Wellington, giving way at four o’clock, in despair at five;\nnor Blücher, who took no part in the engagement. The winner of Waterloo\nwas Cambronne.\n\nTo thunder forth such a reply at the lightning-flash that kills you is\nto conquer!\n\nThus to answer the Catastrophe, thus to speak to Fate, to give this\npedestal to the future lion, to hurl such a challenge to the midnight\nrainstorm, to the treacherous wall of Hougomont, to the sunken road of\nOhain, to Grouchy’s delay, to Blücher’s arrival, to be Irony itself in\nthe tomb, to act so as to stand upright though fallen, to drown in two\nsyllables the European coalition, to offer kings privies which the\nCæsars once knew, to make the lowest of words the most lofty by\nentwining with it the glory of France, insolently to end Waterloo with\nMardigras, to finish Leonidas with Rabellais, to set the crown on this\nvictory by a word impossible to speak, to lose the field and preserve\nhistory, to have the laugh on your side after such a carnage,—this is\nimmense!\n\nIt was an insult such as a thunder-cloud might hurl! It reaches the\ngrandeur of Æschylus!\n\nCambronne’s reply produces the effect of a violent break. ‘Tis like the\nbreaking of a heart under a weight of scorn. ‘Tis the overflow of agony\nbursting forth. Who conquered? Wellington? No! Had it not been for\nBlücher, he was lost. Was it Blücher? No! If Wellington had not begun,\nBlücher could not have finished. This Cambronne, this man spending his\nlast hour, this unknown soldier, this infinitesimal of war, realizes\nthat here is a falsehood, a falsehood in a catastrophe, and so doubly\nagonizing; and at the moment when his rage is bursting forth because of\nit, he is offered this mockery,—life! How could he restrain himself?\nYonder are all the kings of Europe, the general’s flushed with victory,\nthe Jupiter’s darting thunderbolts; they have a hundred thousand\nvictorious soldiers, and back of the hundred thousand a million; their\ncannon stand with yawning mouths, the match is lighted; they grind down\nunder their heels the Imperial guards, and the grand army; they have\njust crushed Napoleon, and only Cambronne remains,—only this earthworm\nis left to protest. He will protest. Then he seeks for the appropriate\nword as one seeks for a sword. His mouth froths, and the froth is the\nword. In face of this mean and mighty victory, in face of this victory\nwhich counts none victorious, this desperate soldier stands erect. He\ngrants its overwhelming immensity, but he establishes its triviality;\nand he does more than spit upon it. Borne down by numbers, by superior\nforce, by brute matter, he finds in his soul an expression:\n_“Excrément!”_ We repeat it,—to use that word, to do thus, to invent\nsuch an expression, is to be the conqueror!\n\nThe spirit of mighty days at that portentous moment made its descent on\nthat unknown man. Cambronne invents the word for Waterloo as Rouget\ninvents the “Marseillaise,” under the visitation of a breath from on\nhigh. An emanation from the divine whirlwind leaps forth and comes\nsweeping over these men, and they shake, and one of them sings the song\nsupreme, and the other utters the frightful cry.\n\nThis challenge of titanic scorn Cambronne hurls not only at Europe in\nthe name of the Empire,—that would be a trifle: he hurls it at the past\nin the name of the Revolution. It is heard, and Cambronne is recognized\nas possessed by the ancient spirit of the Titans. Danton seems to be\nspeaking! Kléber seems to be bellowing!\n\nAt that word from Cambronne, the English voice responded, “Fire!” The\nbatteries flamed, the hill trembled, from all those brazen mouths\nbelched a last terrible gush of grape-shot; a vast volume of smoke,\nvaguely white in the light of the rising moon, rolled out, and when the\nsmoke dispersed, there was no longer anything there. That formidable\nremnant had been annihilated; the Guard was dead. The four walls of the\nliving redoubt lay prone, and hardly was there discernible, here and\nthere, even a quiver in the bodies; it was thus that the French\nlegions, greater than the Roman legions, expired on Mont-Saint-Jean, on\nthe soil watered with rain and blood, amid the gloomy grain, on the\nspot where nowadays Joseph, who drives the post-wagon from Nivelles,\npasses whistling, and cheerfully whipping up his horse at four o’clock\nin the morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI—QUOT LIBRAS IN DUCE?\n\n\nThe battle of Waterloo is an enigma. It is as obscure to those who won\nit as to those who lost it. For Napoleon it was a panic;10 Blücher sees\nnothing in it but fire; Wellington understands nothing in regard to it.\nLook at the reports. The bulletins are confused, the commentaries\ninvolved. Some stammer, others lisp. Jomini divides the battle of\nWaterloo into four moments; Muffling cuts it up into three changes;\nCharras alone, though we hold another judgment than his on some points,\nseized with his haughty glance the characteristic outlines of that\ncatastrophe of human genius in conflict with divine chance. All the\nother historians suffer from being somewhat dazzled, and in this\ndazzled state they fumble about. It was a day of lightning brilliancy;\nin fact, a crumbling of the military monarchy which, to the vast\nstupefaction of kings, drew all the kingdoms after it—the fall of\nforce, the defeat of war.\n\nIn this event, stamped with superhuman necessity, the part played by\nmen amounts to nothing.\n\nIf we take Waterloo from Wellington and Blücher, do we thereby deprive\nEngland and Germany of anything? No. Neither that illustrious England\nnor that august Germany enter into the problem of Waterloo. Thank\nHeaven, nations are great, independently of the lugubrious feats of the\nsword. Neither England, nor Germany, nor France is contained in a\nscabbard. At this epoch when Waterloo is only a clashing of swords,\nabove Blücher, Germany has Schiller; above Wellington, England has\nByron. A vast dawn of ideas is the peculiarity of our century, and in\nthat aurora England and Germany have a magnificent radiance. They are\nmajestic because they think. The elevation of level which they\ncontribute to civilization is intrinsic with them; it proceeds from\nthemselves and not from an accident. The aggrandizement which they have\nbrought to the nineteenth century has not Waterloo as its source. It is\nonly barbarous peoples who undergo rapid growth after a victory. That\nis the temporary vanity of torrents swelled by a storm. Civilized\npeople, especially in our day, are neither elevated nor abased by the\ngood or bad fortune of a captain. Their specific gravity in the human\nspecies results from something more than a combat. Their honor, thank\nGod! their dignity, their intelligence, their genius, are not numbers\nwhich those gamblers, heroes and conquerors, can put in the lottery of\nbattles. Often a battle is lost and progress is conquered. There is\nless glory and more liberty. The drum holds its peace; reason takes the\nword. It is a game in which he who loses wins. Let us, therefore, speak\nof Waterloo coldly from both sides. Let us render to chance that which\nis due to chance, and to God that which is due to God. What is\nWaterloo? A victory? No. The winning number in the lottery.\n\nThe quine 11 won by Europe, paid by France.\n\nIt was not worthwhile to place a lion there.\n\nWaterloo, moreover, is the strangest encounter in history. Napoleon and\nWellington. They are not enemies; they are opposites. Never did God,\nwho is fond of antitheses, make a more striking contrast, a more\nextraordinary comparison. On one side, precision, foresight, geometry,\nprudence, an assured retreat, reserves spared, with an obstinate\ncoolness, an imperturbable method, strategy, which takes advantage of\nthe ground, tactics, which preserve the equilibrium of battalions,\ncarnage, executed according to rule, war regulated, watch in hand,\nnothing voluntarily left to chance, the ancient classic courage,\nabsolute regularity; on the other, intuition, divination, military\noddity, superhuman instinct, a flaming glance, an indescribable\nsomething which gazes like an eagle, and which strikes like the\nlightning, a prodigious art in disdainful impetuosity, all the\nmysteries of a profound soul, associated with destiny; the stream, the\nplain, the forest, the hill, summoned, and in a manner, forced to obey,\nthe despot going even so far as to tyrannize over the field of battle;\nfaith in a star mingled with strategic science, elevating but\nperturbing it. Wellington was the Barême of war; Napoleon was its\nMichael Angelo; and on this occasion, genius was vanquished by\ncalculation. On both sides some one was awaited. It was the exact\ncalculator who succeeded. Napoleon was waiting for Grouchy; he did not\ncome. Wellington expected Blücher; he came.\n\nWellington is classic war taking its revenge. Bonaparte, at his\ndawning, had encountered him in Italy, and beaten him superbly. The old\nowl had fled before the young vulture. The old tactics had been not\nonly struck as by lightning, but disgraced. Who was that Corsican of\nsix and twenty? What signified that splendid ignoramus, who, with\neverything against him, nothing in his favor, without provisions,\nwithout ammunition, without cannon, without shoes, almost without an\narmy, with a mere handful of men against masses, hurled himself on\nEurope combined, and absurdly won victories in the impossible? Whence\nhad issued that fulminating convict, who almost without taking breath,\nand with the same set of combatants in hand, pulverized, one after the\nother, the five armies of the emperor of Germany, upsetting Beaulieu on\nAlvinzi, Wurmser on Beaulieu, Mélas on Wurmser, Mack on Mélas? Who was\nthis novice in war with the effrontery of a luminary? The academical\nmilitary school excommunicated him, and as it lost its footing; hence,\nthe implacable rancor of the old Cæsarism against the new; of the\nregular sword against the flaming sword; and of the exchequer against\ngenius. On the 18th of June, 1815, that rancor had the last word, and\nbeneath Lodi, Montebello, Montenotte, Mantua, Arcola, it wrote:\nWaterloo. A triumph of the mediocres which is sweet to the majority.\nDestiny consented to this irony. In his decline, Napoleon found\nWurmser, the younger, again in front of him.\n\nIn fact, to get Wurmser, it sufficed to blanch the hair of Wellington.\n\nWaterloo is a battle of the first order, won by a captain of the\nsecond.\n\nThat which must be admired in the battle of Waterloo, is England; the\nEnglish firmness, the English resolution, the English blood; the superb\nthing about England there, no offence to her, was herself. It was not\nher captain; it was her army.\n\nWellington, oddly ungrateful, declares in a letter to Lord Bathurst,\nthat his army, the army which fought on the 18th of June, 1815, was a\n“detestable army.” What does that sombre intermingling of bones buried\nbeneath the furrows of Waterloo think of that?\n\nEngland has been too modest in the matter of Wellington. To make\nWellington so great is to belittle England. Wellington is nothing but a\nhero like many another. Those Scotch Grays, those Horse Guards, those\nregiments of Maitland and of Mitchell, that infantry of Pack and Kempt,\nthat cavalry of Ponsonby and Somerset, those Highlanders playing the\npibroch under the shower of grape-shot, those battalions of Rylandt,\nthose utterly raw recruits, who hardly knew how to handle a musket\nholding their own against Essling’s and Rivoli’s old troops,—that is\nwhat was grand. Wellington was tenacious; in that lay his merit, and we\nare not seeking to lessen it: but the least of his foot-soldiers and of\nhis cavalry would have been as solid as he. The iron soldier is worth\nas much as the Iron Duke. As for us, all our glorification goes to the\nEnglish soldier, to the English army, to the English people. If trophy\nthere be, it is to England that the trophy is due. The column of\nWaterloo would be more just, if, instead of the figure of a man, it\nbore on high the statue of a people.\n\nBut this great England will be angry at what we are saying here. She\nstill cherishes, after her own 1688 and our 1789, the feudal illusion.\nShe believes in heredity and hierarchy. This people, surpassed by none\nin power and glory, regards itself as a nation, and not as a people.\nAnd as a people, it willingly subordinates itself and takes a lord for\nits head. As a workman, it allows itself to be disdained; as a soldier,\nit allows itself to be flogged.\n\nIt will be remembered, that at the battle of Inkermann a sergeant who\nhad, it appears, saved the army, could not be mentioned by Lord Paglan,\nas the English military hierarchy does not permit any hero below the\ngrade of an officer to be mentioned in the reports.\n\nThat which we admire above all, in an encounter of the nature of\nWaterloo, is the marvellous cleverness of chance. A nocturnal rain, the\nwall of Hougomont, the hollow road of Ohain, Grouchy deaf to the\ncannon, Napoleon’s guide deceiving him, Bülow’s guide enlightening\nhim,—the whole of this cataclysm is wonderfully conducted.\n\nOn the whole, let us say it plainly, it was more of a massacre than of\na battle at Waterloo.\n\nOf all pitched battles, Waterloo is the one which has the smallest\nfront for such a number of combatants. Napoleon three-quarters of a\nleague; Wellington, half a league; seventy-two thousand combatants on\neach side. From this denseness the carnage arose.\n\nThe following calculation has been made, and the following proportion\nestablished: Loss of men: at Austerlitz, French, fourteen per cent;\nRussians, thirty per cent; Austrians, forty-four per cent. At Wagram,\nFrench, thirteen per cent; Austrians, fourteen. At the Moskowa, French,\nthirty-seven per cent; Russians, forty-four. At Bautzen, French,\nthirteen per cent; Russians and Prussians, fourteen. At Waterloo,\nFrench, fifty-six per cent; the Allies, thirty-one. Total for Waterloo,\nforty-one per cent; one hundred and forty-four thousand combatants;\nsixty thousand dead.\n\nTo-day the field of Waterloo has the calm which belongs to the earth,\nthe impassive support of man, and it resembles all plains.\n\nAt night, moreover, a sort of visionary mist arises from it; and if a\ntraveller strolls there, if he listens, if he watches, if he dreams\nlike Virgil in the fatal plains of Philippi, the hallucination of the\ncatastrophe takes possession of him. The frightful 18th of June lives\nagain; the false monumental hillock disappears, the lion vanishes in\nair, the battle-field resumes its reality, lines of infantry undulate\nover the plain, furious gallops traverse the horizon; the frightened\ndreamer beholds the flash of sabres, the gleam of bayonets, the flare\nof bombs, the tremendous interchange of thunders; he hears, as it were,\nthe death rattle in the depths of a tomb, the vague clamor of the\nbattle phantom; those shadows are grenadiers, those lights are\ncuirassiers; that skeleton Napoleon, that other skeleton is Wellington;\nall this no longer exists, and yet it clashes together and combats\nstill; and the ravines are empurpled, and the trees quiver, and there\nis fury even in the clouds and in the shadows; all those terrible\nheights, Hougomont, Mont-Saint-Jean, Frischemont, Papelotte,\nPlancenoit, appear confusedly crowned with whirlwinds of spectres\nengaged in exterminating each other.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII—IS WATERLOO TO BE CONSIDERED GOOD?\n\n\nThere exists a very respectable liberal school which does not hate\nWaterloo. We do not belong to it. To us, Waterloo is but the stupefied\ndate of liberty. That such an eagle should emerge from such an egg is\ncertainly unexpected.\n\nIf one places one’s self at the culminating point of view of the\nquestion, Waterloo is intentionally a counter-revolutionary victory. It\nis Europe against France; it is Petersburg, Berlin, and Vienna against\nParis; it is the _statu quo_ against the initiative; it is the 14th of\nJuly, 1789, attacked through the 20th of March, 1815; it is the\nmonarchies clearing the decks in opposition to the indomitable French\nrioting. The final extinction of that vast people which had been in\neruption for twenty-six years—such was the dream. The solidarity of the\nBrunswicks, the Nassaus, the Romanoffs, the Hohenzollerns, the\nHapsburgs with the Bourbons. Waterloo bears divine right on its\ncrupper. It is true, that the Empire having been despotic, the kingdom\nby the natural reaction of things, was forced to be liberal, and that a\nconstitutional order was the unwilling result of Waterloo, to the great\nregret of the conquerors. It is because revolution cannot be really\nconquered, and that being providential and absolutely fatal, it is\nalways cropping up afresh: before Waterloo, in Bonaparte overthrowing\nthe old thrones; after Waterloo, in Louis XVIII. granting and\nconforming to the charter. Bonaparte places a postilion on the throne\nof Naples, and a sergeant on the throne of Sweden, employing inequality\nto demonstrate equality; Louis XVIII. at Saint-Ouen countersigns the\ndeclaration of the rights of man. If you wish to gain an idea of what\nrevolution is, call it Progress; and if you wish to acquire an idea of\nthe nature of progress, call it To-morrow. To-morrow fulfils its work\nirresistibly, and it is already fulfilling it to-day. It always reaches\nits goal strangely. It employs Wellington to make of Foy, who was only\na soldier, an orator. Foy falls at Hougomont and rises again in the\ntribune. Thus does progress proceed. There is no such thing as a bad\ntool for that workman. It does not become disconcerted, but adjusts to\nits divine work the man who has bestridden the Alps, and the good old\ntottering invalid of Father Élysée. It makes use of the gouty man as\nwell as of the conqueror; of the conqueror without, of the gouty man\nwithin. Waterloo, by cutting short the demolition of European thrones\nby the sword, had no other effect than to cause the revolutionary work\nto be continued in another direction. The slashers have finished; it\nwas the turn of the thinkers. The century that Waterloo was intended to\narrest has pursued its march. That sinister victory was vanquished by\nliberty.\n\nIn short, and incontestably, that which triumphed at Waterloo; that\nwhich smiled in Wellington’s rear; that which brought him all the\nmarshals’ staffs of Europe, including, it is said, the staff of a\nmarshal of France; that which joyously trundled the barrows full of\nbones to erect the knoll of the lion; that which triumphantly inscribed\non that pedestal the date “_June_ 18, 1815”; that which encouraged\nBlücher, as he put the flying army to the sword; that which, from the\nheights of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, hovered over France as over\nits prey, was the counter-revolution. It was the counter-revolution\nwhich murmured that infamous word “dismemberment.” On arriving in\nParis, it beheld the crater close at hand; it felt those ashes which\nscorched its feet, and it changed its mind; it returned to the stammer\nof a charter.\n\nLet us behold in Waterloo only that which is in Waterloo. Of\nintentional liberty there is none. The counter-revolution was\ninvoluntarily liberal, in the same manner as, by a corresponding\nphenomenon, Napoleon was involuntarily revolutionary. On the 18th of\nJune, 1815, the mounted Robespierre was hurled from his saddle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII—A RECRUDESCENCE OF DIVINE RIGHT\n\n\nEnd of the dictatorship. A whole European system crumbled away.\n\nThe Empire sank into a gloom which resembled that of the Roman world as\nit expired. Again we behold the abyss, as in the days of the\nbarbarians; only the barbarism of 1815, which must be called by its pet\nname of the counter-revolution, was not long breathed, soon fell to\npanting, and halted short. The Empire was bewept,—let us acknowledge\nthe fact,—and bewept by heroic eyes. If glory lies in the sword\nconverted into a sceptre, the Empire had been glory in person. It had\ndiffused over the earth all the light which tyranny can give—a sombre\nlight. We will say more; an obscure light. Compared to the true\ndaylight, it is night. This disappearance of night produces the effect\nof an eclipse.\n\nLouis XVIII. re-entered Paris. The circling dances of the 8th of July\neffaced the enthusiasms of the 20th of March. The Corsican became the\nantithesis of the Bearnese. The flag on the dome of the Tuileries was\nwhite. The exile reigned. Hartwell’s pine table took its place in front\nof the fleur-de-lys-strewn throne of Louis XIV. Bouvines and Fontenoy\nwere mentioned as though they had taken place on the preceding day,\nAusterlitz having become antiquated. The altar and the throne\nfraternized majestically. One of the most undisputed forms of the\nhealth of society in the nineteenth century was established over\nFrance, and over the continent. Europe adopted the white cockade.\nTrestaillon was celebrated. The device _non pluribus impar_ reappeared\non the stone rays representing a sun upon the front of the barracks on\nthe Quai d’Orsay. Where there had been an Imperial Guard, there was now\na red house. The Arc du Carrousel, all laden with badly borne\nvictories, thrown out of its element among these novelties, a little\nashamed, it may be, of Marengo and Arcola, extricated itself from its\npredicament with the statue of the Duc d’Angoulême. The cemetery of the\nMadeleine, a terrible pauper’s grave in 1793, was covered with jasper\nand marble, since the bones of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette lay in\nthat dust.\n\nIn the moat of Vincennes a sepulchral shaft sprang from the earth,\nrecalling the fact that the Duc d’Enghien had perished in the very\nmonth when Napoleon was crowned. Pope Pius VII., who had performed the\ncoronation very near this death, tranquilly bestowed his blessing on\nthe fall as he had bestowed it on the elevation. At Schoenbrunn there\nwas a little shadow, aged four, whom it was seditious to call the King\nof Rome. And these things took place, and the kings resumed their\nthrones, and the master of Europe was put in a cage, and the old regime\nbecame the new regime, and all the shadows and all the light of the\nearth changed place, because, on the afternoon of a certain summer’s\nday, a shepherd said to a Prussian in the forest, “Go this way, and not\nthat!”\n\n\nThis 1815 was a sort of lugubrious April. Ancient unhealthy and\npoisonous realities were covered with new appearances. A lie wedded\n1789; the right divine was masked under a charter; fictions became\nconstitutional; prejudices, superstitions and mental reservations, with\nArticle 14 in the heart, were varnished over with liberalism. It was\nthe serpent’s change of skin.\n\nMan had been rendered both greater and smaller by Napoleon. Under this\nreign of splendid matter, the ideal had received the strange name of\nideology! It is a grave imprudence in a great man to turn the future\ninto derision. The populace, however, that food for cannon which is so\nfond of the cannoneer, sought him with its glance. Where is he? What is\nhe doing? “Napoleon is dead,” said a passer-by to a veteran of Marengo\nand Waterloo. “He dead!” cried the soldier; “you don’t know him.”\nImagination distrusted this man, even when overthrown. The depths of\nEurope were full of darkness after Waterloo. Something enormous\nremained long empty through Napoleon’s disappearance.\n\nThe kings placed themselves in this void. Ancient Europe profited by it\nto undertake reforms. There was a Holy Alliance; _Belle-Alliance_,\nBeautiful Alliance, the fatal field of Waterloo had said in advance.\n\nIn presence and in face of that antique Europe reconstructed, the\nfeatures of a new France were sketched out. The future, which the\nEmperor had rallied, made its entry. On its brow it bore the star,\nLiberty. The glowing eyes of all young generations were turned on it.\nSingular fact! people were, at one and the same time, in love with the\nfuture, Liberty, and the past, Napoleon. Defeat had rendered the\nvanquished greater. Bonaparte fallen seemed more lofty than Napoleon\nerect. Those who had triumphed were alarmed. England had him guarded by\nHudson Lowe, and France had him watched by Montchenu. His folded arms\nbecame a source of uneasiness to thrones. Alexander called him “my\nsleeplessness.” This terror was the result of the quantity of\nrevolution which was contained in him. That is what explains and\nexcuses Bonapartist liberalism. This phantom caused the old world to\ntremble. The kings reigned, but ill at their ease, with the rock of\nSaint Helena on the horizon.\n\nWhile Napoleon was passing through the death struggle at Longwood, the\nsixty thousand men who had fallen on the field of Waterloo were quietly\nrotting, and something of their peace was shed abroad over the world.\nThe Congress of Vienna made the treaties in 1815, and Europe called\nthis the Restoration.\n\nThis is what Waterloo was.\n\nBut what matters it to the Infinite? all that tempest, all that cloud,\nthat war, then that peace? All that darkness did not trouble for a\nmoment the light of that immense Eye before which a grub skipping from\none blade of grass to another equals the eagle soaring from belfry to\nbelfry on the towers of Notre Dame.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX—THE BATTLE-FIELD AT NIGHT\n\n\nLet us return—it is a necessity in this book—to that fatal\nbattle-field.\n\nOn the 18th of June the moon was full. Its light favored Blücher’s\nferocious pursuit, betrayed the traces of the fugitives, delivered up\nthat disastrous mass to the eager Prussian cavalry, and aided the\nmassacre. Such tragic favors of the night do occur sometimes during\ncatastrophes.\n\nAfter the last cannon-shot had been fired, the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean\nremained deserted.\n\nThe English occupied the encampment of the French; it is the usual sign\nof victory to sleep in the bed of the vanquished. They established\ntheir bivouac beyond Rossomme. The Prussians, let loose on the\nretreating rout, pushed forward. Wellington went to the village of\nWaterloo to draw up his report to Lord Bathurst.\n\nIf ever the _sic vos non vobis_ was applicable, it certainly is to that\nvillage of Waterloo. Waterloo took no part, and lay half a league from\nthe scene of action. Mont-Saint-Jean was cannonaded, Hougomont was\nburned, La Haie-Sainte was taken by assault, Papelotte was burned,\nPlancenoit was burned, La Belle-Alliance beheld the embrace of the two\nconquerors; these names are hardly known, and Waterloo, which worked\nnot in the battle, bears off all the honor.\n\nWe are not of the number of those who flatter war; when the occasion\npresents itself, we tell the truth about it. War has frightful beauties\nwhich we have not concealed; it has also, we acknowledge, some hideous\nfeatures. One of the most surprising is the prompt stripping of the\nbodies of the dead after the victory. The dawn which follows a battle\nalways rises on naked corpses.\n\nWho does this? Who thus soils the triumph? What hideous, furtive hand\nis that which is slipped into the pocket of victory? What pickpockets\nare they who ply their trade in the rear of glory? Some\nphilosophers—Voltaire among the number—affirm that it is precisely\nthose persons who have made the glory. It is the same men, they say;\nthere is no relief corps; those who are erect pillage those who are\nprone on the earth. The hero of the day is the vampire of the night.\nOne has assuredly the right, after all, to strip a corpse a bit when\none is the author of that corpse. For our own part, we do not think so;\nit seems to us impossible that the same hand should pluck laurels and\npurloin the shoes from a dead man.\n\nOne thing is certain, which is, that generally after conquerors follow\nthieves. But let us leave the soldier, especially the contemporary\nsoldier, out of the question.\n\nEvery army has a rear-guard, and it is that which must be blamed.\nBat-like creatures, half brigands and lackeys; all the sorts of\nvespertillos that that twilight called war engenders; wearers of\nuniforms, who take no part in the fighting; pretended invalids;\nformidable limpers; interloping sutlers, trotting along in little\ncarts, sometimes accompanied by their wives, and stealing things which\nthey sell again; beggars offering themselves as guides to officers;\nsoldiers’ servants; marauders; armies on the march in days gone by,—we\nare not speaking of the present,—dragged all this behind them, so that\nin the special language they are called “stragglers.” No army, no\nnation, was responsible for those beings; they spoke Italian and\nfollowed the Germans, then spoke French and followed the English. It\nwas by one of these wretches, a Spanish straggler who spoke French,\nthat the Marquis of Fervacques, deceived by his Picard jargon, and\ntaking him for one of our own men, was traitorously slain and robbed on\nthe battle-field itself, in the course of the night which followed the\nvictory of Cerisoles. The rascal sprang from this marauding. The\ndetestable maxim, _Live on the enemy!_ produced this leprosy, which a\nstrict discipline alone could heal. There are reputations which are\ndeceptive; one does not always know why certain generals, great in\nother directions, have been so popular. Turenne was adored by his\nsoldiers because he tolerated pillage; evil permitted constitutes part\nof goodness. Turenne was so good that he allowed the Palatinate to be\ndelivered over to fire and blood. The marauders in the train of an army\nwere more or less in number, according as the chief was more or less\nsevere. Hoche and Marceau had no stragglers; Wellington had few, and we\ndo him the justice to mention it.\n\nNevertheless, on the night from the 18th to the 19th of June, the dead\nwere robbed. Wellington was rigid; he gave orders that any one caught\nin the act should be shot; but rapine is tenacious. The marauders stole\nin one corner of the battlefield while others were being shot in\nanother.\n\nThe moon was sinister over this plain.\n\nTowards midnight, a man was prowling about, or rather, climbing in the\ndirection of the hollow road of Ohain. To all appearance he was one of\nthose whom we have just described,—neither English nor French, neither\npeasant nor soldier, less a man than a ghoul attracted by the scent of\nthe dead bodies having theft for his victory, and come to rifle\nWaterloo. He was clad in a blouse that was something like a great coat;\nhe was uneasy and audacious; he walked forwards and gazed behind him.\nWho was this man? The night probably knew more of him than the day. He\nhad no sack, but evidently he had large pockets under his coat. From\ntime to time he halted, scrutinized the plain around him as though to\nsee whether he were observed, bent over abruptly, disturbed something\nsilent and motionless on the ground, then rose and fled. His sliding\nmotion, his attitudes, his mysterious and rapid gestures, caused him to\nresemble those twilight larvæ which haunt ruins, and which ancient\nNorman legends call the Alleurs.\n\nCertain nocturnal wading birds produce these silhouettes among the\nmarshes.\n\nA glance capable of piercing all that mist deeply would have perceived\nat some distance a sort of little sutler’s wagon with a fluted wicker\nhood, harnessed to a famished nag which was cropping the grass across\nits bit as it halted, hidden, as it were, behind the hovel which\nadjoins the highway to Nivelles, at the angle of the road from\nMont-Saint-Jean to Braine l’Alleud; and in the wagon, a sort of woman\nseated on coffers and packages. Perhaps there was some connection\nbetween that wagon and that prowler.\n\nThe darkness was serene. Not a cloud in the zenith. What matters it if\nthe earth be red! the moon remains white; these are the indifferences\nof the sky. In the fields, branches of trees broken by grape-shot, but\nnot fallen, upheld by their bark, swayed gently in the breeze of night.\nA breath, almost a respiration, moved the shrubbery. Quivers which\nresembled the departure of souls ran through the grass.\n\nIn the distance the coming and going of patrols and the general rounds\nof the English camp were audible.\n\nHougomont and La Haie-Sainte continued to burn, forming, one in the\nwest, the other in the east, two great flames which were joined by the\ncordon of bivouac fires of the English, like a necklace of rubies with\ntwo carbuncles at the extremities, as they extended in an immense\nsemicircle over the hills along the horizon.\n\nWe have described the catastrophe of the road of Ohain. The heart is\nterrified at the thought of what that death must have been to so many\nbrave men.\n\nIf there is anything terrible, if there exists a reality which\nsurpasses dreams, it is this: to live, to see the sun; to be in full\npossession of virile force; to possess health and joy; to laugh\nvaliantly; to rush towards a glory which one sees dazzling in front of\none; to feel in one’s breast lungs which breathe, a heart which beats,\na will which reasons; to speak, think, hope, love; to have a mother, to\nhave a wife, to have children; to have the light—and all at once, in\nthe space of a shout, in less than a minute, to sink into an abyss; to\nfall, to roll, to crush, to be crushed; to see ears of wheat, flowers,\nleaves, branches; not to be able to catch hold of anything; to feel\none’s sword useless, men beneath one, horses on top of one; to struggle\nin vain, since one’s bones have been broken by some kick in the\ndarkness; to feel a heel which makes one’s eyes start from their\nsockets; to bite horses’ shoes in one’s rage; to stifle, to yell, to\nwrithe; to be beneath, and to say to one’s self, “But just a little\nwhile ago I was a living man!”\n\n\nThere, where that lamentable disaster had uttered its death-rattle, all\nwas silence now. The edges of the hollow road were encumbered with\nhorses and riders, inextricably heaped up. Terrible entanglement! There\nwas no longer any slope, for the corpses had levelled the road with the\nplain, and reached the brim like a well-filled bushel of barley. A heap\nof dead bodies in the upper part, a river of blood in the lower\npart—such was that road on the evening of the 18th of June, 1815. The\nblood ran even to the Nivelles highway, and there overflowed in a large\npool in front of the abatis of trees which barred the way, at a spot\nwhich is still pointed out.\n\nIt will be remembered that it was at the opposite point, in the\ndirection of the Genappe road, that the destruction of the cuirassiers\nhad taken place. The thickness of the layer of bodies was proportioned\nto the depth of the hollow road. Towards the middle, at the point where\nit became level, where Delort’s division had passed, the layer of\ncorpses was thinner.\n\nThe nocturnal prowler whom we have just shown to the reader was going\nin that direction. He was searching that vast tomb. He gazed about. He\npassed the dead in some sort of hideous review. He walked with his feet\nin the blood.\n\nAll at once he paused.\n\nA few paces in front of him, in the hollow road, at the point where the\npile of dead came to an end, an open hand, illumined by the moon,\nprojected from beneath that heap of men. That hand had on its finger\nsomething sparkling, which was a ring of gold.\n\nThe man bent over, remained in a crouching attitude for a moment, and\nwhen he rose there was no longer a ring on the hand.\n\nHe did not precisely rise; he remained in a stooping and frightened\nattitude, with his back turned to the heap of dead, scanning the\nhorizon on his knees, with the whole upper portion of his body\nsupported on his two forefingers, which rested on the earth, and his\nhead peering above the edge of the hollow road. The jackal’s four paws\nsuit some actions.\n\nThen coming to a decision, he rose to his feet.\n\nAt that moment, he gave a terrible start. He felt some one clutch him\nfrom behind.\n\nHe wheeled round; it was the open hand, which had closed, and had\nseized the skirt of his coat.\n\nAn honest man would have been terrified; this man burst into a laugh.\n\n“Come,” said he, “it’s only a dead body. I prefer a spook to a\ngendarme.”\n\n\nBut the hand weakened and released him. Effort is quickly exhausted in\nthe grave.\n\n“Well now,” said the prowler, “is that dead fellow alive? Let’s see.”\n\n\nHe bent down again, fumbled among the heap, pushed aside everything\nthat was in his way, seized the hand, grasped the arm, freed the head,\npulled out the body, and a few moments later he was dragging the\nlifeless, or at least the unconscious, man, through the shadows of\nhollow road. He was a cuirassier, an officer, and even an officer of\nconsiderable rank; a large gold epaulette peeped from beneath the\ncuirass; this officer no longer possessed a helmet. A furious sword-cut\nhad scarred his face, where nothing was discernible but blood.\n\nHowever, he did not appear to have any broken limbs, and, by some happy\nchance, if that word is permissible here, the dead had been vaulted\nabove him in such a manner as to preserve him from being crushed. His\neyes were still closed.\n\nOn his cuirass he wore the silver cross of the Legion of Honor.\n\nThe prowler tore off this cross, which disappeared into one of the\ngulfs which he had beneath his great coat.\n\nThen he felt of the officer’s fob, discovered a watch there, and took\npossession of it. Next he searched his waistcoat, found a purse and\npocketed it.\n\nWhen he had arrived at this stage of succor which he was administering\nto this dying man, the officer opened his eyes.\n\n“Thanks,” he said feebly.\n\nThe abruptness of the movements of the man who was manipulating him,\nthe freshness of the night, the air which he could inhale freely, had\nroused him from his lethargy.\n\nThe prowler made no reply. He raised his head. A sound of footsteps was\naudible in the plain; some patrol was probably approaching.\n\nThe officer murmured, for the death agony was still in his voice:—\n\n“Who won the battle?”\n\n\n“The English,” answered the prowler.\n\nThe officer went on:—\n\n“Look in my pockets; you will find a watch and a purse. Take them.”\n\n\nIt was already done.\n\nThe prowler executed the required feint, and said:—\n\n“There is nothing there.”\n\n\n“I have been robbed,” said the officer; “I am sorry for that. You\nshould have had them.”\n\n\nThe steps of the patrol became more and more distinct.\n\n“Some one is coming,” said the prowler, with the movement of a man who\nis taking his departure.\n\nThe officer raised his arm feebly, and detained him.\n\n“You have saved my life. Who are you?”\n\n\nThe prowler answered rapidly, and in a low voice:—\n\n“Like yourself, I belonged to the French army. I must leave you. If\nthey were to catch me, they would shoot me. I have saved your life. Now\nget out of the scrape yourself.”\n\n\n“What is your rank?”\n\n\n“Sergeant.”\n\n\n“What is your name?”\n\n\n“Thénardier.”\n\n\n“I shall not forget that name,” said the officer; “and do you remember\nmine. My name is Pontmercy.”\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SECOND—THE SHIP ORION\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—NUMBER 24,601 BECOMES NUMBER 9,430\n\n\nJean Valjean had been recaptured.\n\nThe reader will be grateful to us if we pass rapidly over the sad\ndetails. We will confine ourselves to transcribing two paragraphs\npublished by the journals of that day, a few months after the\nsurprising events which had taken place at M. sur M.\n\nThese articles are rather summary. It must be remembered, that at that\nepoch the _Gazette des Tribunaux_ was not yet in existence.\n\nWe borrow the first from the _Drapeau Blanc_. It bears the date of July\n25, 1823.\n\nAn arrondissement of the Pas de Calais has just been the theatre of an\nevent quite out of the ordinary course. A man, who was a stranger in\nthe Department, and who bore the name of M. Madeleine, had, thanks to\nthe new methods, resuscitated some years ago an ancient local industry,\nthe manufacture of jet and of black glass trinkets. He had made his\nfortune in the business, and that of the arrondissement as well, we\nwill admit. He had been appointed mayor, in recognition of his\nservices. The police discovered that M. Madeleine was no other than an\nex-convict who had broken his ban, condemned in 1796 for theft, and\nnamed Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean has been recommitted to prison. It\nappears that previous to his arrest he had succeeded in withdrawing\nfrom the hands of M. Laffitte, a sum of over half a million which he\nhad lodged there, and which he had, moreover, and by perfectly\nlegitimate means, acquired in his business. No one has been able to\ndiscover where Jean Valjean has concealed this money since his return\nto prison at Toulon.\n\nThe second article, which enters a little more into detail, is an\nextract from the _Journal de Paris_, of the same date.\n\nA former convict, who had been liberated, named Jean Valjean, has just\nappeared before the Court of Assizes of the Var, under circumstances\ncalculated to attract attention. This wretch had succeeded in escaping\nthe vigilance of the police, he had changed his name, and had succeeded\nin getting himself appointed mayor of one of our small northern towns;\nin this town he had established a considerable commerce. He has at last\nbeen unmasked and arrested, thanks to the indefatigable zeal of the\npublic prosecutor. He had for his concubine a woman of the town, who\ndied of a shock at the moment of his arrest. This scoundrel, who is\nendowed with Herculean strength, found means to escape; but three or\nfour days after his flight the police laid their hands on him once\nmore, in Paris itself, at the very moment when he was entering one of\nthose little vehicles which run between the capital and the village of\nMontfermeil (Seine-et-Oise). He is said to have profited by this\ninterval of three or four days of liberty, to withdraw a considerable\nsum deposited by him with one of our leading bankers. This sum has been\nestimated at six or seven hundred thousand francs. If the indictment is\nto be trusted, he has hidden it in some place known to himself alone,\nand it has not been possible to lay hands on it. However that may be,\nthe said Jean Valjean has just been brought before the Assizes of the\nDepartment of the Var as accused of highway robbery accompanied with\nviolence, about eight years ago, on the person of one of those honest\nchildren who, as the patriarch of Ferney has said, in immortal verse,\n\n“. . . Arrive from Savoy every year,\nAnd who, with gentle hands, do clear\nThose long canals choked up with soot.”\n\n\nThis bandit refused to defend himself. It was proved by the skilful and\neloquent representative of the public prosecutor, that the theft was\ncommitted in complicity with others, and that Jean Valjean was a member\nof a band of robbers in the south. Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty\nand was condemned to the death penalty in consequence. This criminal\nrefused to lodge an appeal. The king, in his inexhaustible clemency,\nhas deigned to commute his penalty to that of penal servitude for life.\nJean Valjean was immediately taken to the prison at Toulon.\n\nThe reader has not forgotten that Jean Valjean had religious habits at\nM. sur M. Some papers, among others the _Constitutional_, presented\nthis commutation as a triumph of the priestly party.\n\nJean Valjean changed his number in the galleys. He was called 9,430.\n\nHowever, and we will mention it at once in order that we may not be\nobliged to recur to the subject, the prosperity of M. sur M. vanished\nwith M. Madeleine; all that he had foreseen during his night of fever\nand hesitation was realized; lacking him, there actually was _a soul\nlacking_. After this fall, there took place at M. sur M. that\negotistical division of great existences which have fallen, that fatal\ndismemberment of flourishing things which is accomplished every day,\nobscurely, in the human community, and which history has noted only\nonce, because it occurred after the death of Alexander. Lieutenants are\ncrowned kings; superintendents improvise manufacturers out of\nthemselves. Envious rivalries arose. M. Madeleine’s vast workshops were\nshut; his buildings fell to ruin, his workmen were scattered. Some of\nthem quitted the country, others abandoned the trade. Thenceforth,\neverything was done on a small scale, instead of on a grand scale; for\nlucre instead of the general good. There was no longer a centre;\neverywhere there was competition and animosity. M. Madeleine had\nreigned over all and directed all. No sooner had he fallen, than each\npulled things to himself; the spirit of combat succeeded to the spirit\nof organization, bitterness to cordiality, hatred of one another to the\nbenevolence of the founder towards all; the threads which M. Madeleine\nhad set were tangled and broken, the methods were adulterated, the\nproducts were debased, confidence was killed; the market diminished,\nfor lack of orders; salaries were reduced, the workshops stood still,\nbankruptcy arrived. And then there was nothing more for the poor. All\nhad vanished.\n\nThe state itself perceived that some one had been crushed somewhere.\nLess than four years after the judgment of the Court of Assizes\nestablishing the identity of Jean Valjean and M. Madeleine, for the\nbenefit of the galleys, the cost of collecting taxes had doubled in the\narrondissement of M. sur M.; and M. de Villèle called attention to the\nfact in the rostrum, in the month of February, 1827.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—IN WHICH THE READER WILL PERUSE TWO VERSES, WHICH ARE OF THE\nDEVIL’S COMPOSITION, POSSIBLY\n\n\nBefore proceeding further, it will be to the purpose to narrate in some\ndetail, a singular occurrence which took place at about the same epoch,\nin Montfermeil, and which is not lacking in coincidence with certain\nconjectures of the indictment.\n\nThere exists in the region of Montfermeil a very ancient superstition,\nwhich is all the more curious and all the more precious, because a\npopular superstition in the vicinity of Paris is like an aloe in\nSiberia. We are among those who respect everything which is in the\nnature of a rare plant. Here, then, is the superstition of Montfermeil:\nit is thought that the devil, from time immemorial, has selected the\nforest as a hiding-place for his treasures. Goodwives affirm that it is\nno rarity to encounter at nightfall, in secluded nooks of the forest, a\nblack man with the air of a carter or a wood-chopper, wearing wooden\nshoes, clad in trousers and a blouse of linen, and recognizable by the\nfact, that, instead of a cap or hat, he has two immense horns on his\nhead. This ought, in fact, to render him recognizable. This man is\nhabitually engaged in digging a hole. There are three ways of profiting\nby such an encounter. The first is to approach the man and speak to\nhim. Then it is seen that the man is simply a peasant, that he appears\nblack because it is nightfall; that he is not digging any hole\nwhatever, but is cutting grass for his cows, and that what had been\ntaken for horns is nothing but a dung-fork which he is carrying on his\nback, and whose teeth, thanks to the perspective of evening, seemed to\nspring from his head. The man returns home and dies within the week.\nThe second way is to watch him, to wait until he has dug his hole,\nuntil he has filled it and has gone away; then to run with great speed\nto the trench, to open it once more and to seize the “treasure” which\nthe black man has necessarily placed there. In this case one dies\nwithin the month. Finally, the last method is not to speak to the black\nman, not to look at him, and to flee at the best speed of one’s legs.\nOne then dies within the year.\n\nAs all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences,\nthe second, which at all events, presents some advantages, among others\nthat of possessing a treasure, if only for a month, is the one most\ngenerally adopted. So bold men, who are tempted by every chance, have\nquite frequently, as we are assured, opened the holes excavated by the\nblack man, and tried to rob the devil. The success of the operation\nappears to be but moderate. At least, if the tradition is to be\nbelieved, and in particular the two enigmatical lines in barbarous\nLatin, which an evil Norman monk, a bit of a sorcerer, named Tryphon\nhas left on this subject. This Tryphon is buried at the Abbey of\nSaint-Georges de Bocherville, near Rouen, and toads spawn on his grave.\n\nAccordingly, enormous efforts are made. Such trenches are ordinarily\nextremely deep; a man sweats, digs, toils all night—for it must be done\nat night; he wets his shirt, burns out his candle, breaks his mattock,\nand when he arrives at the bottom of the hole, when he lays his hand on\nthe “treasure,” what does he find? What is the devil’s treasure? A sou,\nsometimes a crown-piece, a stone, a skeleton, a bleeding body,\nsometimes a spectre folded in four like a sheet of paper in a\nportfolio, sometimes nothing. This is what Tryphon’s verses seem to\nannounce to the indiscreet and curious:—\n\n“Fodit, et in fossa thesauros condit opaca,\nAs, nummas, lapides, cadaver, simulacra, nihilque.”\n\n\nIt seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powder-horn with\nbullets, sometimes an old pack of cards greasy and worn, which has\nevidently served the devil. Tryphon does not record these two finds,\nsince Tryphon lived in the twelfth century, and since the devil does\nnot appear to have had the wit to invent powder before Roger Bacon’s\ntime, and cards before the time of Charles VI.\n\nMoreover, if one plays at cards, one is sure to lose all that one\npossesses! and as for the powder in the horn, it possesses the property\nof making your gun burst in your face.\n\nNow, a very short time after the epoch when it seemed to the\nprosecuting attorney that the liberated convict Jean Valjean during his\nflight of several days had been prowling around Montfermeil, it was\nremarked in that village that a certain old road-laborer, named\nBoulatruelle, had “peculiar ways” in the forest. People thereabouts\nthought they knew that this Boulatruelle had been in the galleys. He\nwas subjected to certain police supervision, and, as he could find work\nnowhere, the administration employed him at reduced rates as a\nroad-mender on the crossroad from Gagny to Lagny.\n\nThis Boulatruelle was a man who was viewed with disfavor by the\ninhabitants of the district as too respectful, too humble, too prompt\nin removing his cap to every one, and trembling and smiling in the\npresence of the gendarmes,—probably affiliated to robber bands, they\nsaid; suspected of lying in ambush at verge of copses at nightfall. The\nonly thing in his favor was that he was a drunkard.\n\nThis is what people thought they had noticed:—\n\nOf late, Boulatruelle had taken to quitting his task of stone-breaking\nand care of the road at a very early hour, and to betaking himself to\nthe forest with his pickaxe. He was encountered towards evening in the\nmost deserted clearings, in the wildest thickets; and he had the\nappearance of being in search of something, and sometimes he was\ndigging holes. The goodwives who passed took him at first for\nBeelzebub; then they recognized Boulatruelle, and were not in the least\nreassured thereby. These encounters seemed to cause Boulatruelle a\nlively displeasure. It was evident that he sought to hide, and that\nthere was some mystery in what he was doing.\n\nIt was said in the village: “It is clear that the devil has appeared.\nBoulatruelle has seen him, and is on the search. In sooth, he is\ncunning enough to pocket Lucifer’s hoard.”\n\n\nThe Voltairians added, “Will Boulatruelle catch the devil, or will the\ndevil catch Boulatruelle?” The old women made a great many signs of the\ncross.\n\nIn the meantime, Boulatruelle’s manœuvres in the forest ceased; and he\nresumed his regular occupation of roadmending; and people gossiped of\nsomething else.\n\nSome persons, however, were still curious, surmising that in all this\nthere was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends, but some fine\nwindfall of a more serious and palpable sort than the devil’s\nbank-bills, and that the road-mender had half discovered the secret.\nThe most “puzzled” were the schoolmaster and Thénardier, the proprietor\nof the tavern, who was everybody’s friend, and had not disdained to\nally himself with Boulatruelle.\n\n“He has been in the galleys,” said Thénardier. “Eh! Good God! no one\nknows who has been there or will be there.”\n\n\nOne evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times the law\nwould have instituted an inquiry as to what Boulatruelle did in the\nforest, and that the latter would have been forced to speak, and that\nhe would have been put to the torture in case of need, and that\nBoulatruelle would not have resisted the water test, for example. “Let\nus put him to the wine test,” said Thénardier.\n\nThey made an effort, and got the old road-mender to drinking.\nBoulatruelle drank an enormous amount, but said very little. He\ncombined with admirable art, and in masterly proportions, the thirst of\na gormandizer with the discretion of a judge. Nevertheless, by dint of\nreturning to the charge and of comparing and putting together the few\nobscure words which he did allow to escape him, this is what Thénardier\nand the schoolmaster imagined that they had made out:—\n\nOne morning, when Boulatruelle was on his way to his work, at daybreak,\nhe had been surprised to see, at a nook of the forest in the\nunderbrush, a shovel and a pickaxe, _concealed, as one might say_.\n\nHowever, he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel and\npick of Father Six-Fours, the water-carrier, and would have thought no\nmore about it. But, on the evening of that day, he saw, without being\nseen himself, as he was hidden by a large tree, “a person who did not\nbelong in those parts, and whom he, Boulatruelle, knew well,” directing\nhis steps towards the densest part of the wood. Translation by\nThénardier: _A comrade of the galleys_. Boulatruelle obstinately\nrefused to reveal his name. This person carried a package—something\nsquare, like a large box or a small trunk. Surprise on the part of\nBoulatruelle. However, it was only after the expiration of seven or\neight minutes that the idea of following that “person” had occurred to\nhim. But it was too late; the person was already in the thicket, night\nhad descended, and Boulatruelle had not been able to catch up with him.\nThen he had adopted the course of watching for him at the edge of the\nwoods. “It was moonlight.” Two or three hours later, Boulatruelle had\nseen this person emerge from the brushwood, carrying no longer the\ncoffer, but a shovel and pick. Boulatruelle had allowed the person to\npass, and had not dreamed of accosting him, because he said to himself\nthat the other man was three times as strong as he was, and armed with\na pickaxe, and that he would probably knock him over the head on\nrecognizing him, and on perceiving that he was recognized. Touching\neffusion of two old comrades on meeting again. But the shovel and pick\nhad served as a ray of light to Boulatruelle; he had hastened to the\nthicket in the morning, and had found neither shovel nor pick. From\nthis he had drawn the inference that this person, once in the forest,\nhad dug a hole with his pick, buried the coffer, and reclosed the hole\nwith his shovel. Now, the coffer was too small to contain a body;\ntherefore it contained money. Hence his researches. Boulatruelle had\nexplored, sounded, searched the entire forest and the thicket, and had\ndug wherever the earth appeared to him to have been recently turned up.\nIn vain.\n\nHe had “ferreted out” nothing. No one in Montfermeil thought any more\nabout it. There were only a few brave gossips, who said, “You may be\ncertain that the mender on the Gagny road did not take all that trouble\nfor nothing; he was sure that the devil had come.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—THE ANKLE-CHAIN MUST HAVE UNDERGONE A CERTAIN PREPARATORY\nMANIPULATION TO BE THUS BROKEN WITH A BLOW FROM A HAMMER\n\n\nTowards the end of October, in that same year, 1823, the inhabitants of\nToulon beheld the entry into their port, after heavy weather, and for\nthe purpose of repairing some damages, of the ship _Orion_, which was\nemployed later at Brest as a school-ship, and which then formed a part\nof the Mediterranean squadron.\n\nThis vessel, battered as it was,—for the sea had handled it\nroughly,—produced a fine effect as it entered the roads. It flew some\ncolors which procured for it the regulation salute of eleven guns,\nwhich it returned, shot for shot; total, twenty-two. It has been\ncalculated that what with salvos, royal and military politenesses,\ncourteous exchanges of uproar, signals of etiquette, formalities of\nroadsteads and citadels, sunrises and sunsets, saluted every day by all\nfortresses and all ships of war, openings and closings of ports, etc.,\nthe civilized world, discharged all over the earth, in the course of\nfour and twenty hours, one hundred and fifty thousand useless shots. At\nsix francs the shot, that comes to nine hundred thousand francs a day,\nthree hundred millions a year, which vanish in smoke. This is a mere\ndetail. All this time the poor were dying of hunger.\n\nThe year 1823 was what the Restoration called “the epoch of the Spanish\nwar.”\n\n\nThis war contained many events in one, and a quantity of peculiarities.\nA grand family affair for the house of Bourbon; the branch of France\nsuccoring and protecting the branch of Madrid, that is to say,\nperforming an act devolving on the elder; an apparent return to our\nnational traditions, complicated by servitude and by subjection to the\ncabinets of the North; M. le Duc d’Angoulême, surnamed by the liberal\nsheets _the hero of Andujar_, compressing in a triumphal attitude that\nwas somewhat contradicted by his peaceable air, the ancient and very\npowerful terrorism of the Holy Office at variance with the chimerical\nterrorism of the liberals; the _sansculottes_ resuscitated, to the\ngreat terror of dowagers, under the name of _descamisados_; monarchy\nopposing an obstacle to progress described as anarchy; the theories of\n’89 roughly interrupted in the sap; a European halt, called to the\nFrench idea, which was making the tour of the world; beside the son of\nFrance as generalissimo, the Prince de Carignan, afterwards Charles\nAlbert, enrolling himself in that crusade of kings against people as a\nvolunteer, with grenadier epaulets of red worsted; the soldiers of the\nEmpire setting out on a fresh campaign, but aged, saddened, after eight\nyears of repose, and under the white cockade; the tricolored standard\nwaved abroad by a heroic handful of Frenchmen, as the white standard\nhad been thirty years earlier at Coblentz; monks mingled with our\ntroops; the spirit of liberty and of novelty brought to its senses by\nbayonets; principles slaughtered by cannonades; France undoing by her\narms that which she had done by her mind; in addition to this, hostile\nleaders sold, soldiers hesitating, cities besieged by millions; no\nmilitary perils, and yet possible explosions, as in every mine which is\nsurprised and invaded; but little bloodshed, little honor won, shame\nfor some, glory for no one. Such was this war, made by the princes\ndescended from Louis XIV., and conducted by generals who had been under\nNapoleon. Its sad fate was to recall neither the grand war nor grand\npolitics.\n\nSome feats of arms were serious; the taking of the Trocadéro, among\nothers, was a fine military action; but after all, we repeat, the\ntrumpets of this war give back a cracked sound, the whole effect was\nsuspicious; history approves of France for making a difficulty about\naccepting this false triumph. It seemed evident that certain Spanish\nofficers charged with resistance yielded too easily; the idea of\ncorruption was connected with the victory; it appears as though\ngenerals and not battles had been won, and the conquering soldier\nreturned humiliated. A debasing war, in short, in which the _Bank of\nFrance_ could be read in the folds of the flag.\n\nSoldiers of the war of 1808, on whom Saragossa had fallen in formidable\nruin, frowned in 1823 at the easy surrender of citadels, and began to\nregret Palafox. It is the nature of France to prefer to have\nRostopchine rather than Ballesteros in front of her.\n\nFrom a still more serious point of view, and one which it is also\nproper to insist upon here, this war, which wounded the military spirit\nof France, enraged the democratic spirit. It was an enterprise of\nenthralment. In that campaign, the object of the French soldier, the\nson of democracy, was the conquest of a yoke for others. A hideous\ncontradiction. France is made to arouse the soul of nations, not to\nstifle it. All the revolutions of Europe since 1792 are the French\nRevolution: liberty darts rays from France. That is a solar fact. Blind\nis he who will not see! It was Bonaparte who said it.\n\nThe war of 1823, an outrage on the generous Spanish nation, was then,\nat the same time, an outrage on the French Revolution. It was France\nwho committed this monstrous violence; by foul means, for, with the\nexception of wars of liberation, everything that armies do is by foul\nmeans. The words _passive obedience_ indicate this. An army is a\nstrange masterpiece of combination where force results from an enormous\nsum of impotence. Thus is war, made by humanity against humanity,\ndespite humanity, explained.\n\nAs for the Bourbons, the war of 1823 was fatal to them. They took it\nfor a success. They did not perceive the danger that lies in having an\nidea slain to order. They went astray, in their innocence, to such a\ndegree that they introduced the immense enfeeblement of a crime into\ntheir establishment as an element of strength. The spirit of the ambush\nentered into their politics. 1830 had its germ in 1823. The Spanish\ncampaign became in their counsels an argument for force and for\nadventures by right Divine. France, having re-established _el rey\nnetto_ in Spain, might well have re-established the absolute king at\nhome. They fell into the alarming error of taking the obedience of the\nsoldier for the consent of the nation. Such confidence is the ruin of\nthrones. It is not permitted to fall asleep, either in the shadow of a\nmachineel tree, nor in the shadow of an army.\n\nLet us return to the ship _Orion_.\n\nDuring the operations of the army commanded by the prince\ngeneralissimo, a squadron had been cruising in the Mediterranean. We\nhave just stated that the _Orion_ belonged to this fleet, and that\naccidents of the sea had brought it into port at Toulon.\n\nThe presence of a vessel of war in a port has something about it which\nattracts and engages a crowd. It is because it is great, and the crowd\nloves what is great.\n\nA ship of the line is one of the most magnificent combinations of the\ngenius of man with the powers of nature.\n\nA ship of the line is composed, at the same time, of the heaviest and\nthe lightest of possible matter, for it deals at one and the same time\nwith three forms of substance,—solid, liquid, and fluid,—and it must do\nbattle with all three. It has eleven claws of iron with which to seize\nthe granite on the bottom of the sea, and more wings and more antennæ\nthan winged insects, to catch the wind in the clouds. Its breath pours\nout through its hundred and twenty cannons as through enormous\ntrumpets, and replies proudly to the thunder. The ocean seeks to lead\nit astray in the alarming sameness of its billows, but the vessel has\nits soul, its compass, which counsels it and always shows it the north.\nIn the blackest nights, its lanterns supply the place of the stars.\nThus, against the wind, it has its cordage and its canvas; against the\nwater, wood; against the rocks, its iron, brass, and lead; against the\nshadows, its light; against immensity, a needle.\n\nIf one wishes to form an idea of all those gigantic proportions which,\ntaken as a whole, constitute the ship of the line, one has only to\nenter one of the six-story covered construction stocks, in the ports of\nBrest or Toulon. The vessels in process of construction are under a\nbell-glass there, as it were. This colossal beam is a yard; that great\ncolumn of wood which stretches out on the earth as far as the eye can\nreach is the main-mast. Taking it from its root in the stocks to its\ntip in the clouds, it is sixty fathoms long, and its diameter at its\nbase is three feet. The English main-mast rises to a height of two\nhundred and seventeen feet above the water-line. The navy of our\nfathers employed cables, ours employs chains. The simple pile of chains\non a ship of a hundred guns is four feet high, twenty feet in breadth,\nand eight feet in depth. And how much wood is required to make this\nship? Three thousand cubic metres. It is a floating forest.\n\nAnd moreover, let this be borne in mind, it is only a question here of\nthe military vessel of forty years ago, of the simple sailing-vessel;\nsteam, then in its infancy, has since added new miracles to that\nprodigy which is called a war vessel. At the present time, for example,\nthe mixed vessel with a screw is a surprising machine, propelled by\nthree thousand square metres of canvas and by an engine of two thousand\nfive hundred horse-power.\n\nNot to mention these new marvels, the ancient vessel of Christopher\nColumbus and of De Ruyter is one of the masterpieces of man. It is as\ninexhaustible in force as is the Infinite in gales; it stores up the\nwind in its sails, it is precise in the immense vagueness of the\nbillows, it floats, and it reigns.\n\nThere comes an hour, nevertheless, when the gale breaks that sixty-foot\nyard like a straw, when the wind bends that mast four hundred feet\ntall, when that anchor, which weighs tens of thousands, is twisted in\nthe jaws of the waves like a fisherman’s hook in the jaws of a pike,\nwhen those monstrous cannons utter plaintive and futile roars, which\nthe hurricane bears forth into the void and into night, when all that\npower and all that majesty are engulfed in a power and majesty which\nare superior.\n\nEvery time that immense force is displayed to culminate in an immense\nfeebleness it affords men food for thought. Hence in the ports curious\npeople abound around these marvellous machines of war and of\nnavigation, without being able to explain perfectly to themselves why.\nEvery day, accordingly, from morning until night, the quays, sluices,\nand the jetties of the port of Toulon were covered with a multitude of\nidlers and loungers, as they say in Paris, whose business consisted in\nstaring at the _Orion_.\n\nThe _Orion_ was a ship that had been ailing for a long time; in the\ncourse of its previous cruises thick layers of barnacles had collected\non its keel to such a degree as to deprive it of half its speed; it had\ngone into the dry dock the year before this, in order to have the\nbarnacles scraped off, then it had put to sea again; but this cleaning\nhad affected the bolts of the keel: in the neighborhood of the Balearic\nIsles the sides had been strained and had opened; and, as the plating\nin those days was not of sheet iron, the vessel had sprung a leak. A\nviolent equinoctial gale had come up, which had first staved in a\ngrating and a porthole on the larboard side, and damaged the\nforetop-gallant-shrouds; in consequence of these injuries, the _Orion_\nhad run back to Toulon.\n\nIt anchored near the Arsenal; it was fully equipped, and repairs were\nbegun. The hull had received no damage on the starboard, but some of\nthe planks had been unnailed here and there, according to custom, to\npermit of air entering the hold.\n\nOne morning the crowd which was gazing at it witnessed an accident.\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nThe Ship Orion, an Accident 2b2-1-the-ship-orion\n\n\nThe crew was busy bending the sails; the topman, who had to take the\nupper corner of the main-top-sail on the starboard, lost his balance;\nhe was seen to waver; the multitude thronging the Arsenal quay uttered\na cry; the man’s head overbalanced his body; the man fell around the\nyard, with his hands outstretched towards the abyss; on his way he\nseized the footrope, first with one hand, then with the other, and\nremained hanging from it: the sea lay below him at a dizzy depth; the\nshock of his fall had imparted to the foot-rope a violent swinging\nmotion; the man swayed back and forth at the end of that rope, like a\nstone in a sling.\n\nIt was incurring a frightful risk to go to his assistance; not one of\nthe sailors, all fishermen of the coast, recently levied for the\nservice, dared to attempt it. In the meantime, the unfortunate topman\nwas losing his strength; his anguish could not be discerned on his\nface, but his exhaustion was visible in every limb; his arms were\ncontracted in horrible twitchings; every effort which he made to\nre-ascend served but to augment the oscillations of the foot-rope; he\ndid not shout, for fear of exhausting his strength. All were awaiting\nthe minute when he should release his hold on the rope, and, from\ninstant to instant, heads were turned aside that his fall might not be\nseen. There are moments when a bit of rope, a pole, the branch of a\ntree, is life itself, and it is a terrible thing to see a living being\ndetach himself from it and fall like a ripe fruit.\n\nAll at once a man was seen climbing into the rigging with the agility\nof a tiger-cat; this man was dressed in red; he was a convict; he wore\na green cap; he was a life convict. On arriving on a level with the\ntop, a gust of wind carried away his cap, and allowed a perfectly white\nhead to be seen: he was not a young man.\n\nA convict employed on board with a detachment from the galleys had, in\nfact, at the very first instant, hastened to the officer of the watch,\nand, in the midst of the consternation and the hesitation of the crew,\nwhile all the sailors were trembling and drawing back, he had asked the\nofficer’s permission to risk his life to save the topman; at an\naffirmative sign from the officer he had broken the chain riveted to\nhis ankle with one blow of a hammer, then he had caught up a rope, and\nhad dashed into the rigging: no one noticed, at the instant, with what\nease that chain had been broken; it was only later on that the incident\nwas recalled.\n\nIn a twinkling he was on the yard; he paused for a few seconds and\nappeared to be measuring it with his eye; these seconds, during which\nthe breeze swayed the topman at the extremity of a thread, seemed\ncenturies to those who were looking on. At last, the convict raised his\neyes to heaven and advanced a step: the crowd drew a long breath. He\nwas seen to run out along the yard: on arriving at the point, he\nfastened the rope which he had brought to it, and allowed the other end\nto hang down, then he began to descend the rope, hand over hand, and\nthen,—and the anguish was indescribable,—instead of one man suspended\nover the gulf, there were two.\n\nOne would have said it was a spider coming to seize a fly, only here\nthe spider brought life, not death. Ten thousand glances were fastened\non this group; not a cry, not a word; the same tremor contracted every\nbrow; all mouths held their breath as though they feared to add the\nslightest puff to the wind which was swaying the two unfortunate men.\n\nIn the meantime, the convict had succeeded in lowering himself to a\nposition near the sailor. It was high time; one minute more, and the\nexhausted and despairing man would have allowed himself to fall into\nthe abyss. The convict had moored him securely with the cord to which\nhe clung with one hand, while he was working with the other. At last,\nhe was seen to climb back on the yard, and to drag the sailor up after\nhim; he held him there a moment to allow him to recover his strength,\nthen he grasped him in his arms and carried him, walking on the yard\nhimself to the cap, and from there to the main-top, where he left him\nin the hands of his comrades.\n\nAt that moment the crowd broke into applause: old convict-sergeants\namong them wept, and women embraced each other on the quay, and all\nvoices were heard to cry with a sort of tender rage, “Pardon for that\nman!”\n\n\nHe, in the meantime, had immediately begun to make his descent to\nrejoin his detachment. In order to reach them the more speedily, he\ndropped into the rigging, and ran along one of the lower yards; all\neyes were following him. At a certain moment fear assailed them;\nwhether it was that he was fatigued, or that his head turned, they\nthought they saw him hesitate and stagger. All at once the crowd\nuttered a loud shout: the convict had fallen into the sea.\n\nThe fall was perilous. The frigate _Algésiras_ was anchored alongside\nthe _Orion_, and the poor convict had fallen between the two vessels:\nit was to be feared that he would slip under one or the other of them.\nFour men flung themselves hastily into a boat; the crowd cheered them\non; anxiety again took possession of all souls; the man had not risen\nto the surface; he had disappeared in the sea without leaving a ripple,\nas though he had fallen into a cask of oil: they sounded, they dived.\nIn vain. The search was continued until the evening: they did not even\nfind the body.\n\nOn the following day the Toulon newspaper printed these lines:—\n\n“Nov. 17, 1823. Yesterday, a convict belonging to the detachment on\nboard of the _Orion_, on his return from rendering assistance to a\nsailor, fell into the sea and was drowned. The body has not yet been\nfound; it is supposed that it is entangled among the piles of the\nArsenal point: this man was committed under the number 9,430, and his\nname was Jean Valjean.”\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THIRD—ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE PROMISE MADE TO THE DEAD WOMAN\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE WATER QUESTION AT MONTFERMEIL\n\n\nMontfermeil is situated between Livry and Chelles, on the southern edge\nof that lofty table-land which separates the Ourcq from the Marne. At\nthe present day it is a tolerably large town, ornamented all the year\nthrough with plaster villas, and on Sundays with beaming bourgeois. In\n1823 there were at Montfermeil neither so many white houses nor so many\nwell-satisfied citizens: it was only a village in the forest. Some\npleasure-houses of the last century were to be met with there, to be\nsure, which were recognizable by their grand air, their balconies in\ntwisted iron, and their long windows, whose tiny panes cast all sorts\nof varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters; but\nMontfermeil was nonetheless a village. Retired cloth-merchants and\nrusticating attorneys had not discovered it as yet; it was a peaceful\nand charming place, which was not on the road to anywhere: there people\nlived, and cheaply, that peasant rustic life which is so bounteous and\nso easy; only, water was rare there, on account of the elevation of the\nplateau.\n\nIt was necessary to fetch it from a considerable distance; the end of\nthe village towards Gagny drew its water from the magnificent ponds\nwhich exist in the woods there. The other end, which surrounds the\nchurch and which lies in the direction of Chelles, found drinking-water\nonly at a little spring half-way down the slope, near the road to\nChelles, about a quarter of an hour from Montfermeil.\n\nThus each household found it hard work to keep supplied with water. The\nlarge houses, the aristocracy, of which the Thénardier tavern formed a\npart, paid half a farthing a bucketful to a man who made a business of\nit, and who earned about eight sous a day in his enterprise of\nsupplying Montfermeil with water; but this good man only worked until\nseven o’clock in the evening in summer, and five in winter; and night\nonce come and the shutters on the ground floor once closed, he who had\nno water to drink went to fetch it for himself or did without it.\n\nThis constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader has\nprobably not forgotten,—little Cosette. It will be remembered that\nCosette was useful to the Thénardiers in two ways: they made the mother\npay them, and they made the child serve them. So when the mother ceased\nto pay altogether, the reason for which we have read in preceding\nchapters, the Thénardiers kept Cosette. She took the place of a servant\nin their house. In this capacity she it was who ran to fetch water when\nit was required. So the child, who was greatly terrified at the idea of\ngoing to the spring at night, took great care that water should never\nbe lacking in the house.\n\nChristmas of the year 1823 was particularly brilliant at Montfermeil.\nThe beginning of the winter had been mild; there had been neither snow\nnor frost up to that time. Some mountebanks from Paris had obtained\npermission of the mayor to erect their booths in the principal street\nof the village, and a band of itinerant merchants, under protection of\nthe same tolerance, had constructed their stalls on the Church Square,\nand even extended them into Boulanger Alley, where, as the reader will\nperhaps remember, the Thénardiers’ hostelry was situated. These people\nfilled the inns and drinking-shops, and communicated to that tranquil\nlittle district a noisy and joyous life. In order to play the part of a\nfaithful historian, we ought even to add that, among the curiosities\ndisplayed in the square, there was a menagerie, in which frightful\nclowns, clad in rags and coming no one knew whence, exhibited to the\npeasants of Montfermeil in 1823 one of those horrible Brazilian\nvultures, such as our Royal Museum did not possess until 1845, and\nwhich have a tricolored cockade for an eye. I believe that naturalists\ncall this bird Caracara Polyborus; it belongs to the order of the\nApicides, and to the family of the vultures. Some good old Bonapartist\nsoldiers, who had retired to the village, went to see this creature\nwith great devotion. The mountebanks gave out that the tricolored\ncockade was a unique phenomenon made by God expressly for their\nmenagerie.\n\nOn Christmas eve itself, a number of men, carters, and peddlers, were\nseated at table, drinking and smoking around four or five candles in\nthe public room of Thénardier’s hostelry. This room resembled all\ndrinking-shop rooms,—tables, pewter jugs, bottles, drinkers, smokers;\nbut little light and a great deal of noise. The date of the year 1823\nwas indicated, nevertheless, by two objects which were then fashionable\nin the bourgeois class: to wit, a kaleidoscope and a lamp of ribbed\ntin. The female Thénardier was attending to the supper, which was\nroasting in front of a clear fire; her husband was drinking with his\ncustomers and talking politics.\n\nBesides political conversations which had for their principal subjects\nthe Spanish war and M. le Duc d’Angoulême, strictly local parentheses,\nlike the following, were audible amid the uproar:—\n\n“About Nanterre and Suresnes the vines have flourished greatly. When\nten pieces were reckoned on there have been twelve. They have yielded a\ngreat deal of juice under the press.” “But the grapes cannot be ripe?”\n“In those parts the grapes should not be ripe; the wine turns oily as\nsoon as spring comes.” “Then it is very thin wine?” “There are wines\npoorer even than these. The grapes must be gathered while green.” Etc.\n\nOr a miller would call out:—\n\n“Are we responsible for what is in the sacks? We find in them a\nquantity of small seed which we cannot sift out, and which we are\nobliged to send through the mill-stones; there are tares, fennel,\nvetches, hempseed, fox-tail, and a host of other weeds, not to mention\npebbles, which abound in certain wheat, especially in Breton wheat. I\nam not fond of grinding Breton wheat, any more than long-sawyers like\nto saw beams with nails in them. You can judge of the bad dust that\nmakes in grinding. And then people complain of the flour. They are in\nthe wrong. The flour is no fault of ours.”\n\n\nIn a space between two windows a mower, who was seated at table with a\nlanded proprietor who was fixing on a price for some meadow work to be\nperformed in the spring, was saying:—\n\n“It does no harm to have the grass wet. It cuts better. Dew is a good\nthing, sir. It makes no difference with that grass. Your grass is young\nand very hard to cut still. It’s terribly tender. It yields before the\niron.” Etc.\n\nCosette was in her usual place, seated on the cross-bar of the kitchen\ntable near the chimney. She was in rags; her bare feet were thrust into\nwooden shoes, and by the firelight she was engaged in knitting woollen\nstockings destined for the young Thénardiers. A very young kitten was\nplaying about among the chairs. Laughter and chatter were audible in\nthe adjoining room, from two fresh children’s voices: it was Éponine\nand Azelma.\n\nIn the chimney-corner a cat-o’-nine-tails was hanging on a nail.\n\nAt intervals the cry of a very young child, which was somewhere in the\nhouse, rang through the noise of the dram-shop. It was a little boy who\nhad been born to the Thénardiers during one of the preceding\nwinters,—“she did not know why,” she said, “the result of the\ncold,”—and who was a little more than three years old. The mother had\nnursed him, but she did not love him. When the persistent clamor of the\nbrat became too annoying, “Your son is squalling,” Thénardier would\nsay; “do go and see what he wants.” “Bah!” the mother would reply, “he\nbothers me.” And the neglected child continued to shriek in the dark.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—TWO COMPLETE PORTRAITS\n\n\nSo far in this book the Thénardiers have been viewed only in profile;\nthe moment has arrived for making the circuit of this couple, and\nconsidering it under all its aspects.\n\nThénardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday; Madame Thénardier was\napproaching her forties, which is equivalent to fifty in a woman; so\nthat there existed a balance of age between husband and wife.\n\nOur readers have possibly preserved some recollection of this\nThénardier woman, ever since her first appearance,—tall, blond, red,\nfat, angular, square, enormous, and agile; she belonged, as we have\nsaid, to the race of those colossal wild women, who contort themselves\nat fairs with paving-stones hanging from their hair. She did everything\nabout the house,—made the beds, did the washing, the cooking, and\neverything else. Cosette was her only servant; a mouse in the service\nof an elephant. Everything trembled at the sound of her voice,—window\npanes, furniture, and people. Her big face, dotted with red blotches,\npresented the appearance of a skimmer. She had a beard. She was an\nideal market-porter dressed in woman’s clothes. She swore splendidly;\nshe boasted of being able to crack a nut with one blow of her fist.\nExcept for the romances which she had read, and which made the affected\nlady peep through the ogress at times, in a very queer way, the idea\nwould never have occurred to any one to say of her, “That is a woman.”\nThis Thénardier female was like the product of a wench engrafted on a\nfishwife. When one heard her speak, one said, “That is a gendarme”;\nwhen one saw her drink, one said, “That is a carter”; when one saw her\nhandle Cosette, one said, “That is the hangman.” One of her teeth\nprojected when her face was in repose.\n\nThénardier was a small, thin, pale, angular, bony, feeble man, who had\na sickly air and who was wonderfully healthy. His cunning began here;\nhe smiled habitually, by way of precaution, and was almost polite to\neverybody, even to the beggar to whom he refused half a farthing. He\nhad the glance of a pole-cat and the bearing of a man of letters. He\ngreatly resembled the portraits of the Abbé Delille. His coquetry\nconsisted in drinking with the carters. No one had ever succeeded in\nrendering him drunk. He smoked a big pipe. He wore a blouse, and under\nhis blouse an old black coat. He made pretensions to literature and to\nmaterialism. There were certain names which he often pronounced to\nsupport whatever things he might be saying,—Voltaire, Raynal, Parny,\nand, singularly enough, Saint Augustine. He declared that he had “a\nsystem.” In addition, he was a great swindler. A _filousophe_\n[philosophe], a scientific thief. The species does exist. It will be\nremembered that he pretended to have served in the army; he was in the\nhabit of relating with exuberance, how, being a sergeant in the 6th or\nthe 9th light something or other, at Waterloo, he had alone, and in the\npresence of a squadron of death-dealing hussars, covered with his body\nand saved from death, in the midst of the grape-shot, “a general, who\nhad been dangerously wounded.” Thence arose for his wall the flaring\nsign, and for his inn the name which it bore in the neighborhood, of\n“the cabaret of the Sergeant of Waterloo.” He was a liberal, a classic,\nand a Bonapartist. He had subscribed for the Champ d’Asile. It was said\nin the village that he had studied for the priesthood.\n\nWe believe that he had simply studied in Holland for an inn-keeper.\nThis rascal of composite order was, in all probability, some Fleming\nfrom Lille, in Flanders, a Frenchman in Paris, a Belgian at Brussels,\nbeing comfortably astride of both frontiers. As for his prowess at\nWaterloo, the reader is already acquainted with that. It will be\nperceived that he exaggerated it a trifle. Ebb and flow, wandering,\nadventure, was the leven of his existence; a tattered conscience\nentails a fragmentary life, and, apparently at the stormy epoch of June\n18, 1815, Thénardier belonged to that variety of marauding sutlers of\nwhich we have spoken, beating about the country, selling to some,\nstealing from others, and travelling like a family man, with wife and\nchildren, in a rickety cart, in the rear of troops on the march, with\nan instinct for always attaching himself to the victorious army. This\ncampaign ended, and having, as he said, “some quibus,” he had come to\nMontfermeil and set up an inn there.\n\nThis _quibus_, composed of purses and watches, of gold rings and silver\ncrosses, gathered in harvest-time in furrows sown with corpses, did not\namount to a large total, and did not carry this sutler turned\neating-house-keeper very far.\n\nThénardier had that peculiar rectilinear something about his gestures\nwhich, accompanied by an oath, recalls the barracks, and by a sign of\nthe cross, the seminary. He was a fine talker. He allowed it to be\nthought that he was an educated man. Nevertheless, the schoolmaster had\nnoticed that he pronounced improperly.12\n\nHe composed the travellers’ tariff card in a superior manner, but\npractised eyes sometimes spied out orthographical errors in it.\nThénardier was cunning, greedy, slothful, and clever. He did not\ndisdain his servants, which caused his wife to dispense with them. This\ngiantess was jealous. It seemed to her that that thin and yellow little\nman must be an object coveted by all.\n\nThénardier, who was, above all, an astute and well-balanced man, was a\nscamp of a temperate sort. This is the worst species; hypocrisy enters\ninto it.\n\nIt is not that Thénardier was not, on occasion, capable of wrath to\nquite the same degree as his wife; but this was very rare, and at such\ntimes, since he was enraged with the human race in general, as he bore\nwithin him a deep furnace of hatred. And since he was one of those\npeople who are continually avenging their wrongs, who accuse everything\nthat passes before them of everything which has befallen them, and who\nare always ready to cast upon the first person who comes to hand, as a\nlegitimate grievance, the sum total of the deceptions, the\nbankruptcies, and the calamities of their lives,—when all this leaven\nwas stirred up in him and boiled forth from his mouth and eyes, he was\nterrible. Woe to the person who came under his wrath at such a time!\n\nIn addition to his other qualities, Thénardier was attentive and\npenetrating, silent or talkative, according to circumstances, and\nalways highly intelligent. He had something of the look of sailors, who\nare accustomed to screw up their eyes to gaze through marine glasses.\nThénardier was a statesman.\n\nEvery newcomer who entered the tavern said, on catching sight of Madame\nThénardier, “There is the master of the house.” A mistake. She was not\neven the mistress. The husband was both master and mistress. She\nworked; he created. He directed everything by a sort of invisible and\nconstant magnetic action. A word was sufficient for him, sometimes a\nsign; the mastodon obeyed. Thénardier was a sort of special and\nsovereign being in Madame Thénardier’s eyes, though she did not\nthoroughly realize it. She was possessed of virtues after her own kind;\nif she had ever had a disagreement as to any detail with “Monsieur\nThénardier,”—which was an inadmissible hypothesis, by the way,—she\nwould not have blamed her husband in public on any subject whatever.\nShe would never have committed “before strangers” that mistake so often\ncommitted by women, and which is called in parliamentary language,\n“exposing the crown.” Although their concord had only evil as its\nresult, there was contemplation in Madame Thénardier’s submission to\nher husband. That mountain of noise and of flesh moved under the little\nfinger of that frail despot. Viewed on its dwarfed and grotesque side,\nthis was that grand and universal thing, the adoration of mind by\nmatter; for certain ugly features have a cause in the very depths of\neternal beauty. There was an unknown quantity about Thénardier; hence\nthe absolute empire of the man over that woman. At certain moments she\nbeheld him like a lighted candle; at others she felt him like a claw.\n\nThis woman was a formidable creature who loved no one except her\nchildren, and who did not fear any one except her husband. She was a\nmother because she was mammiferous. But her maternity stopped short\nwith her daughters, and, as we shall see, did not extend to boys. The\nman had but one thought,—how to enrich himself.\n\nHe did not succeed in this. A theatre worthy of this great talent was\nlacking. Thénardier was ruining himself at Montfermeil, if ruin is\npossible to zero; in Switzerland or in the Pyrenees this penniless\nscamp would have become a millionaire; but an inn-keeper must browse\nwhere fate has hitched him.\n\nIt will be understood that the word _inn-keeper_ is here employed in a\nrestricted sense, and does not extend to an entire class.\n\nIn this same year, 1823, Thénardier was burdened with about fifteen\nhundred francs’ worth of petty debts, and this rendered him anxious.\n\nWhatever may have been the obstinate injustice of destiny in this case,\nThénardier was one of those men who understand best, with the most\nprofundity and in the most modern fashion, that thing which is a virtue\namong barbarous peoples and an object of merchandise among civilized\npeoples,—hospitality. Besides, he was an admirable poacher, and quoted\nfor his skill in shooting. He had a certain cold and tranquil laugh,\nwhich was particularly dangerous.\n\nHis theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes.\nHe had professional aphorisms, which he inserted into his wife’s mind.\n“The duty of the inn-keeper,” he said to her one day, violently, and in\na low voice, “is to sell to the first comer, stews, repose, light,\nfire, dirty sheets, a servant, lice, and a smile; to stop passers-by,\nto empty small purses, and to honestly lighten heavy ones; to shelter\ntravelling families respectfully: to shave the man, to pluck the woman,\nto pick the child clean; to quote the window open, the window shut, the\nchimney-corner, the armchair, the chair, the ottoman, the stool, the\nfeather-bed, the mattress and the truss of straw; to know how much the\nshadow uses up the mirror, and to put a price on it; and, by five\nhundred thousand devils, to make the traveller pay for everything, even\nfor the flies which his dog eats!”\n\n\nThis man and this woman were ruse and rage wedded—a hideous and\nterrible team.\n\nWhile the husband pondered and combined, Madame Thénardier thought not\nof absent creditors, took no heed of yesterday nor of to-morrow, and\nlived in a fit of anger, all in a minute.\n\nSuch were these two beings. Cosette was between them, subjected to\ntheir double pressure, like a creature who is at the same time being\nground up in a mill and pulled to pieces with pincers. The man and the\nwoman each had a different method: Cosette was overwhelmed with\nblows—this was the woman’s; she went barefooted in winter—that was the\nman’s doing.\n\nCosette ran upstairs and down, washed, swept, rubbed, dusted, ran,\nfluttered about, panted, moved heavy articles, and weak as she was, did\nthe coarse work. There was no mercy for her; a fierce mistress and\nvenomous master. The Thénardier hostelry was like a spider’s web, in\nwhich Cosette had been caught, and where she lay trembling. The ideal\nof oppression was realized by this sinister household. It was something\nlike the fly serving the spiders.\n\nThe poor child passively held her peace.\n\nWhat takes place within these souls when they have but just quitted\nGod, find themselves thus, at the very dawn of life, very small and in\nthe midst of men all naked!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—MEN MUST HAVE WINE, AND HORSES MUST HAVE WATER\n\n\nFour new travellers had arrived.\n\nCosette was meditating sadly; for, although she was only eight years\nold, she had already suffered so much that she reflected with the\nlugubrious air of an old woman. Her eye was black in consequence of a\nblow from Madame Thénardier’s fist, which caused the latter to remark\nfrom time to time, “How ugly she is with her fist-blow on her eye!”\n\n\nCosette was thinking that it was dark, very dark, that the pitchers and\ncaraffes in the chambers of the travellers who had arrived must have\nbeen filled and that there was no more water in the cistern.\n\nShe was somewhat reassured because no one in the Thénardier\nestablishment drank much water. Thirsty people were never lacking\nthere; but their thirst was of the sort which applies to the jug rather\nthan to the pitcher. Any one who had asked for a glass of water among\nall those glasses of wine would have appeared a savage to all these\nmen. But there came a moment when the child trembled; Madame Thénardier\nraised the cover of a stew-pan which was boiling on the stove, then\nseized a glass and briskly approached the cistern. She turned the\nfaucet; the child had raised her head and was following all the woman’s\nmovements. A thin stream of water trickled from the faucet, and half\nfilled the glass. “Well,” said she, “there is no more water!” A\nmomentary silence ensued. The child did not breathe.\n\n“Bah!” resumed Madame Thénardier, examining the half-filled glass,\n“this will be enough.”\n\n\nCosette applied herself to her work once more, but for a quarter of an\nhour she felt her heart leaping in her bosom like a big snow-flake.\n\nShe counted the minutes that passed in this manner, and wished it were\nthe next morning.\n\nFrom time to time one of the drinkers looked into the street, and\nexclaimed, “It’s as black as an oven!” or, “One must needs be a cat to\ngo about the streets without a lantern at this hour!” And Cosette\ntrembled.\n\nAll at once one of the pedlers who lodged in the hostelry entered, and\nsaid in a harsh voice:—\n\n“My horse has not been watered.”\n\n\n“Yes, it has,” said Madame Thénardier.\n\n“I tell you that it has not,” retorted the pedler.\n\nCosette had emerged from under the table.\n\n“Oh, yes, sir!” said she, “the horse has had a drink; he drank out of a\nbucket, a whole bucketful, and it was I who took the water to him, and\nI spoke to him.”\n\n\nIt was not true; Cosette lied.\n\n“There’s a brat as big as my fist who tells lies as big as the house,”\nexclaimed the pedler. “I tell you that he has not been watered, you\nlittle jade! He has a way of blowing when he has had no water, which I\nknow well.”\n\n\nCosette persisted, and added in a voice rendered hoarse with anguish,\nand which was hardly audible:—\n\n“And he drank heartily.”\n\n\n“Come,” said the pedler, in a rage, “this won’t do at all, let my horse\nbe watered, and let that be the end of it!”\n\n\nCosette crept under the table again.\n\n“In truth, that is fair!” said Madame Thénardier, “if the beast has not\nbeen watered, it must be.”\n\n\nThen glancing about her:—\n\n“Well, now! Where’s that other beast?”\n\n\nShe bent down and discovered Cosette cowering at the other end of the\ntable, almost under the drinkers’ feet.\n\n“Are you coming?” shrieked Madame Thénardier.\n\nCosette crawled out of the sort of hole in which she had hidden\nherself. The Thénardier resumed:—\n\n“Mademoiselle Dog-lack-name, go and water that horse.”\n\n\n“But, Madame,” said Cosette, feebly, “there is no water.”\n\n\nThe Thénardier threw the street door wide open:—\n\n“Well, go and get some, then!”\n\n\nCosette dropped her head, and went for an empty bucket which stood near\nthe chimney-corner.\n\nThis bucket was bigger than she was, and the child could have set down\nin it at her ease.\n\nThe Thénardier returned to her stove, and tasted what was in the\nstewpan, with a wooden spoon, grumbling the while:—\n\n“There’s plenty in the spring. There never was such a malicious\ncreature as that. I think I should have done better to strain my\nonions.”\n\n\nThen she rummaged in a drawer which contained sous, pepper, and\nshallots.\n\n“See here, Mam’selle Toad,” she added, “on your way back, you will get\na big loaf from the baker. Here’s a fifteen-sou piece.”\n\n\nCosette had a little pocket on one side of her apron; she took the coin\nwithout saying a word, and put it in that pocket.\n\nThen she stood motionless, bucket in hand, the open door before her.\nShe seemed to be waiting for some one to come to her rescue.\n\n“Get along with you!” screamed the Thénardier.\n\nCosette went out. The door closed behind her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—ENTRANCE ON THE SCENE OF A DOLL\n\n\nThe line of open-air booths starting at the church, extended, as the\nreader will remember, as far as the hostelry of the Thénardiers. These\nbooths were all illuminated, because the citizens would soon pass on\ntheir way to the midnight mass, with candles burning in paper funnels,\nwhich, as the schoolmaster, then seated at the table at the\nThénardiers’ observed, produced “a magical effect.” In compensation,\nnot a star was visible in the sky.\n\nThe last of these stalls, established precisely opposite the\nThénardiers’ door, was a toy-shop all glittering with tinsel, glass,\nand magnificent objects of tin. In the first row, and far forwards, the\nmerchant had placed on a background of white napkins, an immense doll,\nnearly two feet high, who was dressed in a robe of pink crepe, with\ngold wheat-ears on her head, which had real hair and enamel eyes. All\nthat day, this marvel had been displayed to the wonderment of all\npassers-by under ten years of age, without a mother being found in\nMontfermeil sufficiently rich or sufficiently extravagant to give it to\nher child. Éponine and Azelma had passed hours in contemplating it, and\nCosette herself had ventured to cast a glance at it, on the sly, it is\ntrue.\n\nAt the moment when Cosette emerged, bucket in hand, melancholy and\novercome as she was, she could not refrain from lifting her eyes to\nthat wonderful doll, towards _the lady_, as she called it. The poor\nchild paused in amazement. She had not yet beheld that doll close to.\nThe whole shop seemed a palace to her: the doll was not a doll; it was\na vision. It was joy, splendor, riches, happiness, which appeared in a\nsort of chimerical halo to that unhappy little being so profoundly\nengulfed in gloomy and chilly misery. With the sad and innocent\nsagacity of childhood, Cosette measured the abyss which separated her\nfrom that doll. She said to herself that one must be a queen, or at\nleast a princess, to have a “thing” like that. She gazed at that\nbeautiful pink dress, that beautiful smooth hair, and she thought, “How\nhappy that doll must be!” She could not take her eyes from that\nfantastic stall. The more she looked, the more dazzled she grew. She\nthought she was gazing at paradise. There were other dolls behind the\nlarge one, which seemed to her to be fairies and genii. The merchant,\nwho was pacing back and forth in front of his shop, produced on her\nsomewhat the effect of being the Eternal Father.\n\nIn this adoration she forgot everything, even the errand with which she\nwas charged.\n\nAll at once the Thénardier’s coarse voice recalled her to reality:\n“What, you silly jade! you have not gone? Wait! I’ll give it to you! I\nwant to know what you are doing there! Get along, you little monster!”\n\n\nThe Thénardier had cast a glance into the street, and had caught sight\nof Cosette in her ecstasy.\n\nCosette fled, dragging her pail, and taking the longest strides of\nwhich she was capable.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—THE LITTLE ONE ALL ALONE\n\n\nAs the Thénardier hostelry was in that part of the village which is\nnear the church, it was to the spring in the forest in the direction of\nChelles that Cosette was obliged to go for her water.\n\nShe did not glance at the display of a single other merchant. So long\nas she was in Boulanger Lane and in the neighborhood of the church, the\nlighted stalls illuminated the road; but soon the last light from the\nlast stall vanished. The poor child found herself in the dark. She\nplunged into it. Only, as a certain emotion overcame her, she made as\nmuch motion as possible with the handle of the bucket as she walked\nalong. This made a noise which afforded her company.\n\nThe further she went, the denser the darkness became. There was no one\nin the streets. However, she did encounter a woman, who turned around\non seeing her, and stood still, muttering between her teeth: “Where can\nthat child be going? Is it a werewolf child?” Then the woman recognized\nCosette. “Well,” said she, “it’s the Lark!”\n\n\nIn this manner Cosette traversed the labyrinth of tortuous and deserted\nstreets which terminate in the village of Montfermeil on the side of\nChelles. So long as she had the houses or even the walls only on both\nsides of her path, she proceeded with tolerable boldness. From time to\ntime she caught the flicker of a candle through the crack of a\nshutter—this was light and life; there were people there, and it\nreassured her. But in proportion as she advanced, her pace slackened\nmechanically, as it were. When she had passed the corner of the last\nhouse, Cosette paused. It had been hard to advance further than the\nlast stall; it became impossible to proceed further than the last\nhouse. She set her bucket on the ground, thrust her hand into her hair,\nand began slowly to scratch her head,—a gesture peculiar to children\nwhen terrified and undecided what to do. It was no longer Montfermeil;\nit was the open fields. Black and desert space was before her. She\ngazed in despair at that darkness, where there was no longer any one,\nwhere there were beasts, where there were spectres, possibly. She took\na good look, and heard the beasts walking on the grass, and she\ndistinctly saw spectres moving in the trees. Then she seized her bucket\nagain; fear had lent her audacity. “Bah!” said she; “I will tell him\nthat there was no more water!” And she resolutely re-entered\nMontfermeil.\n\nHardly had she gone a hundred paces when she paused and began to\nscratch her head again. Now it was the Thénardier who appeared to her,\nwith her hideous, hyena mouth, and wrath flashing in her eyes. The\nchild cast a melancholy glance before her and behind her. What was she\nto do? What was to become of her? Where was she to go? In front of her\nwas the spectre of the Thénardier; behind her all the phantoms of the\nnight and of the forest. It was before the Thénardier that she\nrecoiled. She resumed her path to the spring, and began to run. She\nemerged from the village, she entered the forest at a run, no longer\nlooking at or listening to anything. She only paused in her course when\nher breath failed her; but she did not halt in her advance. She went\nstraight before her in desperation.\n\nAs she ran she felt like crying.\n\nThe nocturnal quivering of the forest surrounded her completely.\n\nShe no longer thought, she no longer saw. The immensity of night was\nfacing this tiny creature. On the one hand, all shadow; on the other,\nan atom.\n\nIt was only seven or eight minutes’ walk from the edge of the woods to\nthe spring. Cosette knew the way, through having gone over it many\ntimes in daylight. Strange to say, she did not get lost. A remnant of\ninstinct guided her vaguely. But she did not turn her eyes either to\nright or to left, for fear of seeing things in the branches and in the\nbrushwood. In this manner she reached the spring.\n\nIt was a narrow, natural basin, hollowed out by the water in a clayey\nsoil, about two feet deep, surrounded with moss and with those tall,\ncrimped grasses which are called Henry IV.‘s frills, and paved with\nseveral large stones. A brook ran out of it, with a tranquil little\nnoise.\n\nCosette did not take time to breathe. It was very dark, but she was in\nthe habit of coming to this spring. She felt with her left hand in the\ndark for a young oak which leaned over the spring, and which usually\nserved to support her, found one of its branches, clung to it, bent\ndown, and plunged the bucket in the water. She was in a state of such\nviolent excitement that her strength was trebled. While thus bent over,\nshe did not notice that the pocket of her apron had emptied itself into\nthe spring. The fifteen-sou piece fell into the water. Cosette neither\nsaw nor heard it fall. She drew out the bucket nearly full, and set it\non the grass.\n\nThat done, she perceived that she was worn out with fatigue. She would\nhave liked to set out again at once, but the effort required to fill\nthe bucket had been such that she found it impossible to take a step.\nShe was forced to sit down. She dropped on the grass, and remained\ncrouching there.\n\nShe shut her eyes; then she opened them again, without knowing why, but\nbecause she could not do otherwise. The agitated water in the bucket\nbeside her was describing circles which resembled tin serpents.\n\nOverhead the sky was covered with vast black clouds, which were like\nmasses of smoke. The tragic mask of shadow seemed to bend vaguely over\nthe child.\n\nJupiter was setting in the depths.\n\nThe child stared with bewildered eyes at this great star, with which\nshe was unfamiliar, and which terrified her. The planet was, in fact,\nvery near the horizon and was traversing a dense layer of mist which\nimparted to it a horrible ruddy hue. The mist, gloomily empurpled,\nmagnified the star. One would have called it a luminous wound.\n\nA cold wind was blowing from the plain. The forest was dark, not a leaf\nwas moving; there were none of the vague, fresh gleams of summertide.\nGreat boughs uplifted themselves in frightful wise. Slender and\nmisshapen bushes whistled in the clearings. The tall grasses undulated\nlike eels under the north wind. The nettles seemed to twist long arms\nfurnished with claws in search of prey. Some bits of dry heather,\ntossed by the breeze, flew rapidly by, and had the air of fleeing in\nterror before something which was coming after. On all sides there were\nlugubrious stretches.\n\nThe darkness was bewildering. Man requires light. Whoever buries\nhimself in the opposite of day feels his heart contract. When the eye\nsees black, the heart sees trouble. In an eclipse in the night, in the\nsooty opacity, there is anxiety even for the stoutest of hearts. No one\nwalks alone in the forest at night without trembling. Shadows and\ntrees—two formidable densities. A chimerical reality appears in the\nindistinct depths. The inconceivable is outlined a few paces distant\nfrom you with a spectral clearness. One beholds floating, either in\nspace or in one’s own brain, one knows not what vague and intangible\nthing, like the dreams of sleeping flowers. There are fierce attitudes\non the horizon. One inhales the effluvia of the great black void. One\nis afraid to glance behind him, yet desirous of doing so. The cavities\nof night, things grown haggard, taciturn profiles which vanish when one\nadvances, obscure dishevelments, irritated tufts, livid pools, the\nlugubrious reflected in the funereal, the sepulchral immensity of\nsilence, unknown but possible beings, bendings of mysterious branches,\nalarming torsos of trees, long handfuls of quivering plants,—against\nall this one has no protection. There is no hardihood which does not\nshudder and which does not feel the vicinity of anguish. One is\nconscious of something hideous, as though one’s soul were becoming\namalgamated with the darkness. This penetration of the shadows is\nindescribably sinister in the case of a child.\n\nForests are apocalypses, and the beating of the wings of a tiny soul\nproduces a sound of agony beneath their monstrous vault.\n\nWithout understanding her sensations, Cosette was conscious that she\nwas seized upon by that black enormity of nature; it was no longer\nterror alone which was gaining possession of her; it was something more\nterrible even than terror; she shivered. There are no words to express\nthe strangeness of that shiver which chilled her to the very bottom of\nher heart; her eye grew wild; she thought she felt that she should not\nbe able to refrain from returning there at the same hour on the morrow.\n\nThen, by a sort of instinct, she began to count aloud, one, two, three,\nfour, and so on up to ten, in order to escape from that singular state\nwhich she did not understand, but which terrified her, and, when she\nhad finished, she began again; this restored her to a true perception\nof the things about her. Her hands, which she had wet in drawing the\nwater, felt cold; she rose; her terror, a natural and unconquerable\nterror, had returned: she had but one thought now,—to flee at full\nspeed through the forest, across the fields to the houses, to the\nwindows, to the lighted candles. Her glance fell upon the water which\nstood before her; such was the fright which the Thénardier inspired in\nher, that she dared not flee without that bucket of water: she seized\nthe handle with both hands; she could hardly lift the pail.\n\nIn this manner she advanced a dozen paces, but the bucket was full; it\nwas heavy; she was forced to set it on the ground once more. She took\nbreath for an instant, then lifted the handle of the bucket again, and\nresumed her march, proceeding a little further this time, but again she\nwas obliged to pause. After some seconds of repose she set out again.\nShe walked bent forward, with drooping head, like an old woman; the\nweight of the bucket strained and stiffened her thin arms. The iron\nhandle completed the benumbing and freezing of her wet and tiny hands;\nshe was forced to halt from time to time, and each time that she did\nso, the cold water which splashed from the pail fell on her bare legs.\nThis took place in the depths of a forest, at night, in winter, far\nfrom all human sight; she was a child of eight: no one but God saw that\nsad thing at the moment.\n\nAnd her mother, no doubt, alas!\n\nFor there are things that make the dead open their eyes in their\ngraves.\n\nShe panted with a sort of painful rattle; sobs contracted her throat,\nbut she dared not weep, so afraid was she of the Thénardier, even at a\ndistance: it was her custom to imagine the Thénardier always present.\n\nHowever, she could not make much headway in that manner, and she went\non very slowly. In spite of diminishing the length of her stops, and of\nwalking as long as possible between them, she reflected with anguish\nthat it would take her more than an hour to return to Montfermeil in\nthis manner, and that the Thénardier would beat her. This anguish was\nmingled with her terror at being alone in the woods at night; she was\nworn out with fatigue, and had not yet emerged from the forest. On\narriving near an old chestnut-tree with which she was acquainted, made\na last halt, longer than the rest, in order that she might get well\nrested; then she summoned up all her strength, picked up her bucket\nagain, and courageously resumed her march, but the poor little\ndesperate creature could not refrain from crying, “O my God! my God!”\n\n\nAt that moment she suddenly became conscious that her bucket no longer\nweighed anything at all: a hand, which seemed to her enormous, had just\nseized the handle, and lifted it vigorously. She raised her head. A\nlarge black form, straight and erect, was walking beside her through\nthe darkness; it was a man who had come up behind her, and whose\napproach she had not heard. This man, without uttering a word, had\nseized the handle of the bucket which she was carrying.\n\nThere are instincts for all the encounters of life.\n\nThe child was not afraid.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—WHICH POSSIBLY PROVES BOULATRUELLE’S INTELLIGENCE\n\n\nOn the afternoon of that same Christmas Day, 1823, a man had walked for\nrather a long time in the most deserted part of the Boulevard de\nl’Hôpital in Paris. This man had the air of a person who is seeking\nlodgings, and he seemed to halt, by preference, at the most modest\nhouses on that dilapidated border of the faubourg Saint-Marceau.\n\nWe shall see further on that this man had, in fact, hired a chamber in\nthat isolated quarter.\n\nThis man, in his attire, as in all his person, realized the type of\nwhat may be called the well-bred mendicant,—extreme wretchedness\ncombined with extreme cleanliness. This is a very rare mixture which\ninspires intelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels\nfor the man who is very poor, and for the man who is very worthy. He\nwore a very old and very well brushed round hat; a coarse coat, worn\nperfectly threadbare, of an ochre yellow, a color that was not in the\nleast eccentric at that epoch; a large waistcoat with pockets of a\nvenerable cut; black breeches, worn gray at the knee, stockings of\nblack worsted; and thick shoes with copper buckles. He would have been\npronounced a preceptor in some good family, returned from the\nemigration. He would have been taken for more than sixty years of age,\nfrom his perfectly white hair, his wrinkled brow, his livid lips, and\nhis countenance, where everything breathed depression and weariness of\nlife. Judging from his firm tread, from the singular vigor which\nstamped all his movements, he would have hardly been thought fifty. The\nwrinkles on his brow were well placed, and would have disposed in his\nfavor any one who observed him attentively. His lip contracted with a\nstrange fold which seemed severe, and which was humble. There was in\nthe depth of his glance an indescribable melancholy serenity. In his\nleft hand he carried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief; in his\nright he leaned on a sort of a cudgel, cut from some hedge. This stick\nhad been carefully trimmed, and had an air that was not too\nthreatening; the most had been made of its knots, and it had received a\ncoral-like head, made from red wax: it was a cudgel, and it seemed to\nbe a cane.\n\nThere are but few passers-by on that boulevard, particularly in the\nwinter. The man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them, but this\nwithout any affectation.\n\nAt that epoch, King Louis XVIII. went nearly every day to\nChoisy-le-Roi: it was one of his favorite excursions. Towards two\no’clock, almost invariably, the royal carriage and cavalcade was seen\nto pass at full speed along the Boulevard de l’Hôpital.\n\nThis served in lieu of a watch or clock to the poor women of the\nquarter who said, “It is two o’clock; there he is returning to the\nTuileries.”\n\n\nAnd some rushed forward, and others drew up in line, for a passing king\nalways creates a tumult; besides, the appearance and disappearance of\nLouis XVIII. produced a certain effect in the streets of Paris. It was\nrapid but majestic. This impotent king had a taste for a fast gallop;\nas he was not able to walk, he wished to run: that cripple would gladly\nhave had himself drawn by the lightning. He passed, pacific and severe,\nin the midst of naked swords. His massive couch, all covered with\ngilding, with great branches of lilies painted on the panels, thundered\nnoisily along. There was hardly time to cast a glance upon it. In the\nrear angle on the right there was visible on tufted cushions of white\nsatin a large, firm, and ruddy face, a brow freshly powdered _à\nl’oiseau royal_, a proud, hard, crafty eye, the smile of an educated\nman, two great epaulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeois\ncoat, the Golden Fleece, the cross of Saint Louis, the cross of the\nLegion of Honor, the silver plaque of the Saint-Esprit, a huge belly,\nand a wide blue ribbon: it was the king. Outside of Paris, he held his\nhat decked with white ostrich plumes on his knees enwrapped in high\nEnglish gaiters; when he re-entered the city, he put on his hat and\nsaluted rarely; he stared coldly at the people, and they returned it in\nkind. When he appeared for the first time in the Saint-Marceau quarter,\nthe whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of an\ninhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade, “That big fellow yonder is\nthe government.”\n\n\nThis infallible passage of the king at the same hour was, therefore,\nthe daily event of the Boulevard de l’Hôpital.\n\nThe promenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong in the\nquarter, and probably did not belong in Paris, for he was ignorant as\nto this detail. When, at two o’clock, the royal carriage, surrounded by\na squadron of the body-guard all covered with silver lace, debouched on\nthe boulevard, after having made the turn of the Salpêtrière, he\nappeared surprised and almost alarmed. There was no one but himself in\nthis cross-lane. He drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of an\nenclosure, though this did not prevent M. le Duc de Havré from spying\nhim out.\n\nM. le Duc de Havré, as captain of the guard on duty that day, was\nseated in the carriage, opposite the king. He said to his Majesty,\n“Yonder is an evil-looking man.” Members of the police, who were\nclearing the king’s route, took equal note of him: one of them received\nan order to follow him. But the man plunged into the deserted little\nstreets of the faubourg, and as twilight was beginning to fall, the\nagent lost trace of him, as is stated in a report addressed that same\nevening to M. le Comte d’Anglès, Minister of State, Prefect of Police.\n\nWhen the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent off his track, he\nredoubled his pace, not without turning round many a time to assure\nhimself that he was not being followed. At a quarter-past four, that is\nto say, when night was fully come, he passed in front of the theatre of\nthe Porte Saint-Martin, where _The Two Convicts_ was being played that\nday. This poster, illuminated by the theatre lanterns, struck him; for,\nalthough he was walking rapidly, he halted to read it. An instant later\nhe was in the blind alley of La Planchette, and he entered the _Plat\nd’Etain_ [the Pewter Platter], where the office of the coach for Lagny\nwas then situated. This coach set out at half-past four. The horses\nwere harnessed, and the travellers, summoned by the coachman, were\nhastily climbing the lofty iron ladder of the vehicle.\n\nThe man inquired:—\n\n“Have you a place?”\n\n\n“Only one—beside me on the box,” said the coachman.\n\n“I will take it.”\n\n\n“Climb up.”\n\n\nNevertheless, before setting out, the coachman cast a glance at the\ntraveller’s shabby dress, at the diminutive size of his bundle, and\nmade him pay his fare.\n\n“Are you going as far as Lagny?” demanded the coachman.\n\n“Yes,” said the man.\n\nThe traveller paid to Lagny.\n\nThey started. When they had passed the barrier, the coachman tried to\nenter into conversation, but the traveller only replied in\nmonosyllables. The coachman took to whistling and swearing at his\nhorses.\n\nThe coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak. It was cold. The man did\nnot appear to be thinking of that. Thus they passed Gournay and\nNeuilly-sur-Marne.\n\nTowards six o’clock in the evening they reached Chelles. The coachman\ndrew up in front of the carters’ inn installed in the ancient buildings\nof the Royal Abbey, to give his horses a breathing spell.\n\n“I get down here,” said the man.\n\nHe took his bundle and his cudgel and jumped down from the vehicle.\n\nAn instant later he had disappeared.\n\nHe did not enter the inn.\n\nWhen the coach set out for Lagny a few minutes later, it did not\nencounter him in the principal street of Chelles.\n\nThe coachman turned to the inside travellers.\n\n“There,” said he, “is a man who does not belong here, for I do not know\nhim. He had not the air of owning a sou, but he does not consider\nmoney; he pays to Lagny, and he goes only as far as Chelles. It is\nnight; all the houses are shut; he does not enter the inn, and he is\nnot to be found. So he has dived through the earth.”\n\n\nThe man had not plunged into the earth, but he had gone with great\nstrides through the dark, down the principal street of Chelles, then he\nhad turned to the right before reaching the church, into the crossroad\nleading to Montfermeil, like a person who was acquainted with the\ncountry and had been there before.\n\nHe followed this road rapidly. At the spot where it is intersected by\nthe ancient tree-bordered road which runs from Gagny to Lagny, he heard\npeople coming. He concealed himself precipitately in a ditch, and there\nwaited until the passers-by were at a distance. The precaution was\nnearly superfluous, however; for, as we have already said, it was a\nvery dark December night. Not more than two or three stars were visible\nin the sky.\n\nIt is at this point that the ascent of the hill begins. The man did not\nreturn to the road to Montfermeil; he struck across the fields to the\nright, and entered the forest with long strides.\n\nOnce in the forest he slackened his pace, and began a careful\nexamination of all the trees, advancing, step by step, as though\nseeking and following a mysterious road known to himself alone. There\ncame a moment when he appeared to lose himself, and he paused in\nindecision. At last he arrived, by dint of feeling his way inch by\ninch, at a clearing where there was a great heap of whitish stones. He\nstepped up briskly to these stones, and examined them attentively\nthrough the mists of night, as though he were passing them in review. A\nlarge tree, covered with those excrescences which are the warts of\nvegetation, stood a few paces distant from the pile of stones. He went\nup to this tree and passed his hand over the bark of the trunk, as\nthough seeking to recognize and count all the warts.\n\nOpposite this tree, which was an ash, there was a chestnut-tree,\nsuffering from a peeling of the bark, to which a band of zinc had been\nnailed by way of dressing. He raised himself on tiptoe and touched this\nband of zinc.\n\nThen he trod about for awhile on the ground comprised in the space\nbetween the tree and the heap of stones, like a person who is trying to\nassure himself that the soil has not recently been disturbed.\n\nThat done, he took his bearings, and resumed his march through the\nforest.\n\nIt was the man who had just met Cosette.\n\nAs he walked through the thicket in the direction of Montfermeil, he\nhad espied that tiny shadow moving with a groan, depositing a burden on\nthe ground, then taking it up and setting out again. He drew near, and\nperceived that it was a very young child, laden with an enormous bucket\nof water. Then he approached the child, and silently grasped the handle\nof the bucket.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—COSETTE SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE STRANGER IN THE DARK\n\n\nCosette, as we have said, was not frightened.\n\nThe man accosted her. He spoke in a voice that was grave and almost\nbass.\n\n“My child, what you are carrying is very heavy for you.”\n\n\nCosette raised her head and replied:—\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n\n“Give it to me,” said the man; “I will carry it for you.”\n\n\nCosette let go of the bucket-handle. The man walked along beside her.\n\n“It really is very heavy,” he muttered between his teeth. Then he\nadded:—\n\n“How old are you, little one?”\n\n\n“Eight, sir.”\n\n\n“And have you come from far like this?”\n\n\n“From the spring in the forest.”\n\n\n“Are you going far?”\n\n\n“A good quarter of an hour’s walk from here.”\n\n\nThe man said nothing for a moment; then he remarked abruptly:—\n\n“So you have no mother.”\n\n\n“I don’t know,” answered the child.\n\nBefore the man had time to speak again, she added:—\n\n“I don’t think so. Other people have mothers. I have none.”\n\n\nAnd after a silence she went on:—\n\n“I think that I never had any.”\n\n\nThe man halted; he set the bucket on the ground, bent down and placed\nboth hands on the child’s shoulders, making an effort to look at her\nand to see her face in the dark.\n\nCosette’s thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid light\nin the sky.\n\n“What is your name?” said the man.\n\n“Cosette.”\n\n\nThe man seemed to have received an electric shock. He looked at her\nonce more; then he removed his hands from Cosette’s shoulders, seized\nthe bucket, and set out again.\n\nAfter a moment he inquired:—\n\n“Where do you live, little one?”\n\n\n“At Montfermeil, if you know where that is.”\n\n\n“That is where we are going?”\n\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n\nHe paused; then began again:—\n\n“Who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest?”\n\n\n“It was Madame Thénardier.”\n\n\nThe man resumed, in a voice which he strove to render indifferent, but\nin which there was, nevertheless, a singular tremor:—\n\n“What does your Madame Thénardier do?”\n\n\n“She is my mistress,” said the child. “She keeps the inn.”\n\n\n“The inn?” said the man. “Well, I am going to lodge there to-night.\nShow me the way.”\n\n\n“We are on the way there,” said the child.\n\nThe man walked tolerably fast. Cosette followed him without difficulty.\nShe no longer felt any fatigue. From time to time she raised her eyes\ntowards the man, with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable\nconfidence. She had never been taught to turn to Providence and to\npray; nevertheless, she felt within her something which resembled hope\nand joy, and which mounted towards heaven.\n\nSeveral minutes elapsed. The man resumed:—\n\n“Is there no servant in Madame Thénardier’s house?”\n\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n\n“Are you alone there?”\n\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n\nAnother pause ensued. Cosette lifted up her voice:—\n\n“That is to say, there are two little girls.”\n\n\n“What little girls?”\n\n\n“Ponine and Zelma.”\n\n\nThis was the way the child simplified the romantic names so dear to the\nfemale Thénardier.\n\n“Who are Ponine and Zelma?”\n\n\n“They are Madame Thénardier’s young ladies; her daughters, as you would\nsay.”\n\n\n“And what do those girls do?”\n\n\n“Oh!” said the child, “they have beautiful dolls; things with gold in\nthem, all full of affairs. They play; they amuse themselves.”\n\n\n“All day long?”\n\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n\n“And you?”\n\n\n“I? I work.”\n\n\n“All day long?”\n\n\nThe child raised her great eyes, in which hung a tear, which was not\nvisible because of the darkness, and replied gently:—\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n\nAfter an interval of silence she went on:—\n\n“Sometimes, when I have finished my work and they let me, I amuse\nmyself, too.”\n\n\n“How do you amuse yourself?”\n\n\n“In the best way I can. They let me alone; but I have not many\nplaythings. Ponine and Zelma will not let me play with their dolls. I\nhave only a little lead sword, no longer than that.”\n\n\nThe child held up her tiny finger.\n\n“And it will not cut?”\n\n\n“Yes, sir,” said the child; “it cuts salad and the heads of flies.”\n\n\nThey reached the village. Cosette guided the stranger through the\nstreets. They passed the bakeshop, but Cosette did not think of the\nbread which she had been ordered to fetch. The man had ceased to ply\nher with questions, and now preserved a gloomy silence.\n\nWhen they had left the church behind them, the man, on perceiving all\nthe open-air booths, asked Cosette:—\n\n“So there is a fair going on here?”\n\n\n“No, sir; it is Christmas.”\n\n\nAs they approached the tavern, Cosette timidly touched his arm:—\n\n“Monsieur?”\n\n\n“What, my child?”\n\n\n“We are quite near the house.”\n\n\n“Well?”\n\n\n“Will you let me take my bucket now?”\n\n\n“Why?”\n\n\n“If Madame sees that some one has carried it for me, she will beat me.”\n\n\nThe man handed her the bucket. An instant later they were at the tavern\ndoor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF RECEIVING INTO ONE’S HOUSE A POOR\nMAN WHO MAY BE A RICH MAN\n\n\nCosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the big\ndoll, which was still displayed at the toy-merchant’s; then she\nknocked. The door opened. The Thénardier appeared with a candle in her\nhand.\n\n“Ah! so it’s you, you little wretch! good mercy, but you’ve taken your\ntime! The hussy has been amusing herself!”\n\n\n“Madame,” said Cosette, trembling all over, “here’s a gentleman who\nwants a lodging.”\n\n\nThe Thénardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable grimace,\na change of aspect common to tavern-keepers, and eagerly sought the\nnewcomer with her eyes.\n\n“This is the gentleman?” said she.\n\n“Yes, Madame,” replied the man, raising his hand to his hat.\n\nWealthy travellers are not so polite. This gesture, and an inspection\nof the stranger’s costume and baggage, which the Thénardier passed in\nreview with one glance, caused the amiable grimace to vanish, and the\ngruff mien to reappear. She resumed dryly:—\n\n“Enter, my good man.”\n\n\nThe “good man” entered. The Thénardier cast a second glance at him,\npaid particular attention to his frock-coat, which was absolutely\nthreadbare, and to his hat, which was a little battered, and, tossing\nher head, wrinkling her nose, and screwing up her eyes, she consulted\nher husband, who was still drinking with the carters. The husband\nreplied by that imperceptible movement of the forefinger, which, backed\nup by an inflation of the lips, signifies in such cases: A regular\nbeggar. Thereupon, the Thénardier exclaimed:—\n\n“Ah! see here, my good man; I am very sorry, but I have no room left.”\n\n\n“Put me where you like,” said the man; “in the attic, in the stable. I\nwill pay as though I occupied a room.”\n\n\n“Forty sous.”\n\n\n“Forty sous; agreed.”\n\n\n“Very well, then!”\n\n\n“Forty sous!” said a carter, in a low tone, to the Thénardier woman;\n“why, the charge is only twenty sous!”\n\n\n“It is forty in his case,” retorted the Thénardier, in the same tone.\n“I don’t lodge poor folks for less.”\n\n\n“That’s true,” added her husband, gently; “it ruins a house to have\nsuch people in it.”\n\n\nIn the meantime, the man, laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench,\nhad seated himself at a table, on which Cosette made haste to place a\nbottle of wine and a glass. The merchant who had demanded the bucket of\nwater took it to his horse himself. Cosette resumed her place under the\nkitchen table, and her knitting.\n\nThe man, who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had\npoured out for himself, observed the child with peculiar attention.\n\nCosette was ugly. If she had been happy, she might have been pretty. We\nhave already given a sketch of that sombre little figure. Cosette was\nthin and pale; she was nearly eight years old, but she seemed to be\nhardly six. Her large eyes, sunken in a sort of shadow, were almost put\nout with weeping. The corners of her mouth had that curve of habitual\nanguish which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people.\nHer hands were, as her mother had divined, “ruined with chilblains.”\nThe fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all\nthe angles of her bones, and rendered her thinness frightfully\napparent. As she was always shivering, she had acquired the habit of\npressing her knees one against the other. Her entire clothing was but a\nrag which would have inspired pity in summer, and which inspired horror\nin winter. All she had on was hole-ridden linen, not a scrap of\nwoollen. Her skin was visible here and there and everywhere black and\nblue spots could be descried, which marked the places where the\nThénardier woman had touched her. Her naked legs were thin and red. The\nhollows in her neck were enough to make one weep. This child’s whole\nperson, her mien, her attitude, the sound of her voice, the intervals\nwhich she allowed to elapse between one word and the next, her glance,\nher silence, her slightest gesture, expressed and betrayed one sole\nidea,—fear.\n\nFear was diffused all over her; she was covered with it, so to speak;\nfear drew her elbows close to her hips, withdrew her heels under her\npetticoat, made her occupy as little space as possible, allowed her\nonly the breath that was absolutely necessary, and had become what\nmight be called the habit of her body, admitting of no possible\nvariation except an increase. In the depths of her eyes there was an\nastonished nook where terror lurked.\n\nHer fear was such, that on her arrival, wet as she was, Cosette did not\ndare to approach the fire and dry herself, but sat silently down to her\nwork again.\n\nThe expression in the glance of that child of eight years was\nhabitually so gloomy, and at times so tragic, that it seemed at certain\nmoments as though she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a\ndemon.\n\nAs we have stated, she had never known what it is to pray; she had\nnever set foot in a church. “Have I the time?” said the Thénardier.\n\nThe man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from Cosette.\n\nAll at once, the Thénardier exclaimed:—\n\n“By the way, where’s that bread?”\n\n\nCosette, according to her custom whenever the Thénardier uplifted her\nvoice, emerged with great haste from beneath the table.\n\nShe had completely forgotten the bread. She had recourse to the\nexpedient of children who live in a constant state of fear. She lied.\n\n“Madame, the baker’s shop was shut.”\n\n\n“You should have knocked.”\n\n\n“I did knock, Madame.”\n\n\n“Well?”\n\n\n“He did not open the door.”\n\n\n“I’ll find out to-morrow whether that is true,” said the Thénardier;\n“and if you are telling me a lie, I’ll lead you a pretty dance. In the\nmeantime, give me back my fifteen-sou piece.”\n\n\nCosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron, and turned\ngreen. The fifteen-sou piece was not there.\n\n“Ah, come now,” said Madame Thénardier, “did you hear me?”\n\n\nCosette turned her pocket inside out; there was nothing in it. What\ncould have become of that money? The unhappy little creature could not\nfind a word to say. She was petrified.\n\n“Have you lost that fifteen-sou piece?” screamed the Thénardier,\nhoarsely, “or do you want to rob me of it?”\n\n\nAt the same time, she stretched out her arm towards the\ncat-o’-nine-tails which hung on a nail in the chimney-corner.\n\nThis formidable gesture restored to Cosette sufficient strength to\nshriek:—\n\n“Mercy, Madame, Madame! I will not do so any more!”\n\n\nThe Thénardier took down the whip.\n\nIn the meantime, the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the\nfob of his waistcoat, without any one having noticed his movements.\nBesides, the other travellers were drinking or playing cards, and were\nnot paying attention to anything.\n\nCosette contracted herself into a ball, with anguish, within the angle\nof the chimney, endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor half-nude\nlimbs. The Thénardier raised her arm.\n\n“Pardon me, Madame,” said the man, “but just now I caught sight of\nsomething which had fallen from this little one’s apron pocket, and\nrolled aside. Perhaps this is it.”\n\n\nAt the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor\nfor a moment.\n\n“Exactly; here it is,” he went on, straightening himself up.\n\nAnd he held out a silver coin to the Thénardier.\n\n“Yes, that’s it,” said she.\n\nIt was not it, for it was a twenty-sou piece; but the Thénardier found\nit to her advantage. She put the coin in her pocket, and confined\nherself to casting a fierce glance at the child, accompanied with the\nremark, “Don’t let this ever happen again!”\n\n\nCosette returned to what the Thénardier called “her kennel,” and her\nlarge eyes, which were riveted on the traveller, began to take on an\nexpression such as they had never worn before. Thus far it was only an\ninnocent amazement, but a sort of stupefied confidence was mingled with\nit.\n\n“By the way, would you like some supper?” the Thénardier inquired of\nthe traveller.\n\nHe made no reply. He appeared to be absorbed in thought.\n\n“What sort of a man is that?” she muttered between her teeth. “He’s\nsome frightfully poor wretch. He hasn’t a sou to pay for a supper. Will\nhe even pay me for his lodging? It’s very lucky, all the same, that it\ndid not occur to him to steal the money that was on the floor.”\n\n\nIn the meantime, a door had opened, and Éponine and Azelma entered.\n\nThey were two really pretty little girls, more bourgeois than peasant\nin looks, and very charming; the one with shining chestnut tresses, the\nother with long black braids hanging down her back, both vivacious,\nneat, plump, rosy, and healthy, and a delight to the eye. They were\nwarmly clad, but with so much maternal art that the thickness of the\nstuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement. There was a\nhint of winter, though the springtime was not wholly effaced. Light\nemanated from these two little beings. Besides this, they were on the\nthrone. In their toilettes, in their gayety, in the noise which they\nmade, there was sovereignty. When they entered, the Thénardier said to\nthem in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration, “Ah! there you\nare, you children!”\n\n\nThen drawing them, one after the other to her knees, smoothing their\nhair, tying their ribbons afresh, and then releasing them with that\ngentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers, she\nexclaimed, “What frights they are!”\n\n\nThey went and seated themselves in the chimney-corner. They had a doll,\nwhich they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyous\nchatter. From time to time Cosette raised her eyes from her knitting,\nand watched their play with a melancholy air.\n\nÉponine and Azelma did not look at Cosette. She was the same as a dog\nto them. These three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twenty\nyears between them, but they already represented the whole society of\nman; envy on the one side, disdain on the other.\n\nThe doll of the Thénardier sisters was very much faded, very old, and\nmuch broken; but it seemed nonetheless admirable to Cosette, who had\nnever had a doll in her life, _a real doll_, to make use of the\nexpression which all children will understand.\n\nAll at once, the Thénardier, who had been going back and forth in the\nroom, perceived that Cosette’s mind was distracted, and that, instead\nof working, she was paying attention to the little ones at their play.\n\n“Ah! I’ve caught you at it!” she cried. “So that’s the way you work!\nI’ll make you work to the tune of the whip; that I will.”\n\n\nThe stranger turned to the Thénardier, without quitting his chair.\n\n“Bah, Madame,” he said, with an almost timid air, “let her play!”\n\n\nSuch a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton\nand had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper, and who had\nnot the air of being frightfully poor, would have been equivalent to an\norder. But that a man with such a hat should permit himself such a\ndesire, and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have a\nwill, was something which Madame Thénardier did not intend to tolerate.\nShe retorted with acrimony:—\n\n“She must work, since she eats. I don’t feed her to do nothing.”\n\n\n“What is she making?” went on the stranger, in a gentle voice which\ncontrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his porter’s\nshoulders.\n\nThe Thénardier deigned to reply:—\n\n“Stockings, if you please. Stockings for my little girls, who have\nnone, so to speak, and who are absolutely barefoot just now.”\n\n\nThe man looked at Cosette’s poor little red feet, and continued:—\n\n“When will she have finished this pair of stockings?”\n\n\n“She has at least three or four good days’ work on them still, the lazy\ncreature!”\n\n\n“And how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has\nfinished them?”\n\n\nThe Thénardier cast a glance of disdain on him.\n\n“Thirty sous at least.”\n\n\n“Will you sell them for five francs?” went on the man.\n\n“Good heavens!” exclaimed a carter who was listening, with a loud\nlaugh; “five francs! the deuce, I should think so! five balls!”\n\n\nThénardier thought it time to strike in.\n\n“Yes, sir; if such is your fancy, you will be allowed to have that pair\nof stockings for five francs. We can refuse nothing to travellers.”\n\n\n“You must pay on the spot,” said the Thénardier, in her curt and\nperemptory fashion.\n\n“I will buy that pair of stockings,” replied the man, “and,” he added,\ndrawing a five-franc piece from his pocket, and laying it on the table,\n“I will pay for them.”\n\n\nThen he turned to Cosette.\n\n“Now I own your work; play, my child.”\n\n\nThe carter was so much touched by the five-franc piece, that he\nabandoned his glass and hastened up.\n\n“But it’s true!” he cried, examining it. “A real hind wheel! and not\ncounterfeit!”\n\n\nThénardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket.\n\nThe Thénardier had no reply to make. She bit her lips, and her face\nassumed an expression of hatred.\n\nIn the meantime, Cosette was trembling. She ventured to ask:—\n\n“Is it true, Madame? May I play?”\n\n\n“Play!” said the Thénardier, in a terrible voice.\n\n“Thanks, Madame,” said Cosette.\n\nAnd while her mouth thanked the Thénardier, her whole little soul\nthanked the traveller.\n\nThénardier had resumed his drinking; his wife whispered in his ear:—\n\n“Who can this yellow man be?”\n\n\n“I have seen millionaires with coats like that,” replied Thénardier, in\na sovereign manner.\n\nCosette had dropped her knitting, but had not left her seat. Cosette\nalways moved as little as possible. She picked up some old rags and her\nlittle lead sword from a box behind her.\n\nÉponine and Azelma paid no attention to what was going on. They had\njust executed a very important operation; they had just got hold of the\ncat. They had thrown their doll on the ground, and Éponine, who was the\nelder, was swathing the little cat, in spite of its mewing and its\ncontortions, in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps. While\nperforming this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sister\nin that sweet and adorable language of children, whose grace, like the\nsplendor of the butterfly’s wing, vanishes when one essays to fix it\nfast.\n\n“You see, sister, this doll is more amusing than the other. She twists,\nshe cries, she is warm. See, sister, let us play with her. She shall be\nmy little girl. I will be a lady. I will come to see you, and you shall\nlook at her. Gradually, you will perceive her whiskers, and that will\nsurprise you. And then you will see her ears, and then you will see her\ntail and it will amaze you. And you will say to me, ‘Ah! Mon Dieu!’ and\nI will say to you: ‘Yes, Madame, it is my little girl. Little girls are\nmade like that just at present.’”\n\n\nAzelma listened admiringly to Éponine.\n\nIn the meantime, the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song, and to\nlaugh at it until the ceiling shook. Thénardier accompanied and\nencouraged them.\n\nAs birds make nests out of everything, so children make a doll out of\nanything which comes to hand. While Éponine and Azelma were bundling up\nthe cat, Cosette, on her side, had dressed up her sword. That done, she\nlaid it in her arms, and sang to it softly, to lull it to sleep.\n\nThe doll is one of the most imperious needs and, at the same time, one\nof the most charming instincts of feminine childhood. To care for, to\nclothe, to deck, to dress, to undress, to redress, to teach, scold a\nlittle, to rock, to dandle, to lull to sleep, to imagine that something\nis some one,—therein lies the whole woman’s future. While dreaming and\nchattering, making tiny outfits, and baby clothes, while sewing little\ngowns, and corsages and bodices, the child grows into a young girl, the\nyoung girl into a big girl, the big girl into a woman. The first child\nis the continuation of the last doll.\n\nA little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy, and quite as\nimpossible, as a woman without children.\n\nSo Cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword.\n\nMadame Thénardier approached _the yellow man_; “My husband is right,”\nshe thought; “perhaps it is M. Laffitte; there are such queer rich\nmen!”\n\n\nShe came and set her elbows on the table.\n\n“Monsieur,” said she. At this word, _Monsieur_, the man turned; up to\nthat time, the Thénardier had addressed him only as _brave homme_ or\n_bonhomme_.\n\n“You see, sir,” she pursued, assuming a sweetish air that was even more\nrepulsive to behold than her fierce mien, “I am willing that the child\nshould play; I do not oppose it, but it is good for once, because you\nare generous. You see, she has nothing; she must needs work.”\n\n\n“Then this child is not yours?” demanded the man.\n\n“Oh! mon Dieu! no, sir! she is a little beggar whom we have taken in\nthrough charity; a sort of imbecile child. She must have water on the\nbrain; she has a large head, as you see. We do what we can for her, for\nwe are not rich; we have written in vain to her native place, and have\nreceived no reply these six months. It must be that her mother is\ndead.”\n\n\n“Ah!” said the man, and fell into his reverie once more.\n\n“Her mother didn’t amount to much,” added the Thénardier; “she\nabandoned her child.”\n\n\nDuring the whole of this conversation Cosette, as though warned by some\ninstinct that she was under discussion, had not taken her eyes from the\nThénardier’s face; she listened vaguely; she caught a few words here\nand there.\n\nMeanwhile, the drinkers, all three-quarters intoxicated, were repeating\ntheir unclean refrain with redoubled gayety; it was a highly spiced and\nwanton song, in which the Virgin and the infant Jesus were introduced.\nThe Thénardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter.\nCosette, from her post under the table, gazed at the fire, which was\nreflected from her fixed eyes. She had begun to rock the sort of baby\nwhich she had made, and, as she rocked it, she sang in a low voice, “My\nmother is dead! my mother is dead! my mother is dead!”\n\n\nOn being urged afresh by the hostess, the yellow man, “the\nmillionaire,” consented at last to take supper.\n\n“What does Monsieur wish?”\n\n\n“Bread and cheese,” said the man.\n\n“Decidedly, he is a beggar” thought Madame Thénardier.\n\nThe drunken men were still singing their song, and the child under the\ntable was singing hers.\n\nAll at once, Cosette paused; she had just turned round and caught sight\nof the little Thénardiers’ doll, which they had abandoned for the cat\nand had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table.\n\nThen she dropped the swaddled sword, which only half met her needs, and\ncast her eyes slowly round the room. Madame Thénardier was whispering\nto her husband and counting over some money; Ponine and Zelma were\nplaying with the cat; the travellers were eating or drinking or\nsinging; not a glance was fixed on her. She had not a moment to lose;\nshe crept out from under the table on her hands and knees, made sure\nonce more that no one was watching her; then she slipped quickly up to\nthe doll and seized it. An instant later she was in her place again,\nseated motionless, and only turned so as to cast a shadow on the doll\nwhich she held in her arms. The happiness of playing with a doll was so\nrare for her that it contained all the violence of voluptuousness.\n\nNo one had seen her, except the traveller, who was slowly devouring his\nmeagre supper.\n\nThis joy lasted about a quarter of an hour.\n\nBut with all the precautions that Cosette had taken she did not\nperceive that one of the doll’s legs stuck out and that the fire on the\nhearth lighted it up very vividly. That pink and shining foot,\nprojecting from the shadow, suddenly struck the eye of Azelma, who said\nto Éponine, “Look! sister.”\n\n\nThe two little girls paused in stupefaction; Cosette had dared to take\ntheir doll!\n\nÉponine rose, and, without releasing the cat, she ran to her mother,\nand began to tug at her skirt.\n\n“Let me alone!” said her mother; “what do you want?”\n\n\n“Mother,” said the child, “look there!”\n\n\nAnd she pointed to Cosette.\n\nCosette, absorbed in the ecstasies of possession, no longer saw or\nheard anything.\n\nMadame Thénardier’s countenance assumed that peculiar expression which\nis composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life, and which\nhas caused this style of woman to be named _Megaeras_.\n\nOn this occasion, wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further.\nCosette had overstepped all bounds; Cosette had laid violent hands on\nthe doll belonging to “these young ladies.” A czarina who should see a\nmuzhik trying on her imperial son’s blue ribbon would wear no other\nface.\n\nShe shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation:—\n\n“Cosette!”\n\n\nCosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her; she\nturned round.\n\n“Cosette!” repeated the Thénardier.\n\nCosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort of\nveneration, mingled with despair; then, without taking her eyes from\nit, she clasped her hands, and, what is terrible to relate of a child\nof that age, she wrung them; then—not one of the emotions of the day,\nneither the trip to the forest, nor the weight of the bucket of water,\nnor the loss of the money, nor the sight of the whip, nor even the sad\nwords which she had heard Madame Thénardier utter had been able to\nwring this from her—she wept; she burst out sobbing.\n\nMeanwhile, the traveller had risen to his feet.\n\n“What is the matter?” he said to the Thénardier.\n\n“Don’t you see?” said the Thénardier, pointing to the _corpus delicti_\nwhich lay at Cosette’s feet.\n\n“Well, what of it?” resumed the man.\n\n“That beggar,” replied the Thénardier, “has permitted herself to touch\nthe children’s doll!”\n\n\n“All this noise for that!” said the man; “well, what if she did play\nwith that doll?”\n\n\n“She touched it with her dirty hands!” pursued the Thénardier, “with\nher frightful hands!”\n\n\nHere Cosette redoubled her sobs.\n\n“Will you stop your noise?” screamed the Thénardier.\n\nThe man went straight to the street door, opened it, and stepped out.\n\nAs soon as he had gone, the Thénardier profited by his absence to give\nCosette a hearty kick under the table, which made the child utter loud\ncries.\n\nThe door opened again, the man reappeared; he carried in both hands the\nfabulous doll which we have mentioned, and which all the village brats\nhad been staring at ever since the morning, and he set it upright in\nfront of Cosette, saying:—\n\n“Here; this is for you.”\n\n\nIt must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more which he\nhad spent there he had taken confused notice through his reverie of\nthat toy shop, lighted up by fire-pots and candles so splendidly that\nit was visible like an illumination through the window of the\ndrinking-shop.\n\nCosette raised her eyes; she gazed at the man approaching her with that\ndoll as she might have gazed at the sun; she heard the unprecedented\nwords, “It is for you”; she stared at him; she stared at the doll; then\nshe slowly retreated, and hid herself at the extreme end, under the\ntable in a corner of the wall.\n\nShe no longer cried; she no longer wept; she had the appearance of no\nlonger daring to breathe.\n\nThe Thénardier, Éponine, and Azelma were like statues also; the very\ndrinkers had paused; a solemn silence reigned through the whole room.\n\nMadame Thénardier, petrified and mute, recommenced her conjectures:\n“Who is that old fellow? Is he a poor man? Is he a millionaire? Perhaps\nhe is both; that is to say, a thief.”\n\n\nThe face of the male Thénardier presented that expressive fold which\naccentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinct\nappears there in all its bestial force. The tavern-keeper stared\nalternately at the doll and at the traveller; he seemed to be scenting\nout the man, as he would have scented out a bag of money. This did not\nlast longer than the space of a flash of lightning. He stepped up to\nhis wife and said to her in a low voice:—\n\n“That machine costs at least thirty francs. No nonsense. Down on your\nbelly before that man!”\n\n\nGross natures have this in common with _naïve_ natures, that they\npossess no transition state.\n\n“Well, Cosette,” said the Thénardier, in a voice that strove to be\nsweet, and which was composed of the bitter honey of malicious women,\n“aren’t you going to take your doll?”\n\n\nCosette ventured to emerge from her hole.\n\n“The gentleman has given you a doll, my little Cosette,” said\nThénardier, with a caressing air. “Take it; it is yours.”\n\n\nCosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror. Her face was\nstill flooded with tears, but her eyes began to fill, like the sky at\ndaybreak, with strange beams of joy. What she felt at that moment was a\nlittle like what she would have felt if she had been abruptly told,\n“Little one, you are the Queen of France.”\n\n\nIt seemed to her that if she touched that doll, lightning would dart\nfrom it.\n\nThis was true, up to a certain point, for she said to herself that the\nThénardier would scold and beat her.\n\nNevertheless, the attraction carried the day. She ended by drawing near\nand murmuring timidly as she turned towards Madame Thénardier:—\n\n“May I, Madame?”\n\n\nNo words can render that air, at once despairing, terrified, and\necstatic.\n\n“Pardi!” cried the Thénardier, “it is yours. The gentleman has given it\nto you.”\n\n\n“Truly, sir?” said Cosette. “Is it true? Is the ‘lady’ mine?”\n\n\nThe stranger’s eyes seemed to be full of tears. He appeared to have\nreached that point of emotion where a man does not speak for fear lest\nhe should weep. He nodded to Cosette, and placed the “lady’s” hand in\nher tiny hand.\n\nCosette hastily withdrew her hand, as though that of the “lady”\nscorched her, and began to stare at the floor. We are forced to add\nthat at that moment she stuck out her tongue immoderately. All at once\nshe wheeled round and seized the doll in a transport.\n\n“I shall call her Catherine,” she said.\n\nIt was an odd moment when Cosette’s rags met and clasped the ribbons\nand fresh pink muslins of the doll.\n\n“Madame,” she resumed, “may I put her on a chair?”\n\n\n“Yes, my child,” replied the Thénardier.\n\nIt was now the turn of Éponine and Azelma to gaze at Cosette with envy.\n\nCosette placed Catherine on a chair, then seated herself on the floor\nin front of her, and remained motionless, without uttering a word, in\nan attitude of contemplation.\n\n“Play, Cosette,” said the stranger.\n\n“Oh! I am playing,” returned the child.\n\nThis stranger, this unknown individual, who had the air of a visit\nwhich Providence was making on Cosette, was the person whom the\nThénardier hated worse than any one in the world at that moment.\nHowever, it was necessary to control herself. Habituated as she was to\ndissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his\nactions, these emotions were more than she could endure. She made haste\nto send her daughters to bed, then she asked the man’s _permission_ to\nsend Cosette off also; “for she has worked hard all day,” she added\nwith a maternal air. Cosette went off to bed, carrying Catherine in her\narms.\n\nFrom time to time the Thénardier went to the other end of the room\nwhere her husband was, to _relieve her soul_, as she said. She\nexchanged with her husband words which were all the more furious\nbecause she dared not utter them aloud.\n\n“Old beast! What has he got in his belly, to come and upset us in this\nmanner! To want that little monster to play! to give away forty-franc\ndolls to a jade that I would sell for forty sous, so I would! A little\nmore and he will be saying _Your Majesty_ to her, as though to the\nDuchesse de Berry! Is there any sense in it? Is he mad, then, that\nmysterious old fellow?”\n\n\n“Why! it is perfectly simple,” replied Thénardier, “if that amuses him!\nIt amuses you to have the little one work; it amuses him to have her\nplay. He’s all right. A traveller can do what he pleases when he pays\nfor it. If the old fellow is a philanthropist, what is that to you? If\nhe is an imbecile, it does not concern you. What are you worrying for,\nso long as he has money?”\n\n\nThe language of a master, and the reasoning of an innkeeper, neither of\nwhich admitted of any reply.\n\nThe man had placed his elbows on the table, and resumed his thoughtful\nattitude. All the other travellers, both pedlers and carters, had\nwithdrawn a little, and had ceased singing. They were staring at him\nfrom a distance, with a sort of respectful awe. This poorly dressed\nman, who drew “hind-wheels” from his pocket with so much ease, and who\nlavished gigantic dolls on dirty little brats in wooden shoes, was\ncertainly a magnificent fellow, and one to be feared.\n\nMany hours passed. The midnight mass was over, the chimes had ceased,\nthe drinkers had taken their departure, the drinking-shop was closed,\nthe public room was deserted, the fire extinct, the stranger still\nremained in the same place and the same attitude. From time to time he\nchanged the elbow on which he leaned. That was all; but he had not said\na word since Cosette had left the room.\n\nThe Thénardiers alone, out of politeness and curiosity, had remained in\nthe room.\n\n“Is he going to pass the night in that fashion?” grumbled the\nThénardier. When two o’clock in the morning struck, she declared\nherself vanquished, and said to her husband, “I’m going to bed. Do as\nyou like.” Her husband seated himself at a table in the corner, lighted\na candle, and began to read the _Courrier Français_.\n\nA good hour passed thus. The worthy inn-keeper had perused the\n_Courrier Français_ at least three times, from the date of the number\nto the printer’s name. The stranger did not stir.\n\nThénardier fidgeted, coughed, spit, blew his nose, and creaked his\nchair. Not a movement on the man’s part. “Is he asleep?” thought\nThénardier. The man was not asleep, but nothing could arouse him.\n\nAt last Thénardier took off his cap, stepped gently up to him, and\nventured to say:—\n\n“Is not Monsieur going to his repose?”\n\n\n_Not going to bed_ would have seemed to him excessive and familiar. _To\nrepose_ smacked of luxury and respect. These words possess the\nmysterious and admirable property of swelling the bill on the following\nday. A chamber where one _sleeps_ costs twenty sous; a chamber in which\none _reposes_ costs twenty francs.\n\n“Well!” said the stranger, “you are right. Where is your stable?”\n\n\n“Sir!” exclaimed Thénardier, with a smile, “I will conduct you, sir.”\n\n\nHe took the candle; the man picked up his bundle and cudgel, and\nThénardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor, which was of\nrare splendor, all furnished in mahogany, with a low bedstead,\ncurtained with red calico.\n\n“What is this?” said the traveller.\n\n“It is really our bridal chamber,” said the tavern-keeper. “My wife and\nI occupy another. This is only entered three or four times a year.”\n\n\n“I should have liked the stable quite as well,” said the man, abruptly.\n\nThénardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark.\n\nHe lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on the\nchimney-piece. A very good fire was flickering on the hearth.\n\nOn the chimney-piece, under a glass globe, stood a woman’s head-dress\nin silver wire and orange flowers.\n\n“And what is this?” resumed the stranger.\n\n“That, sir,” said Thénardier, “is my wife’s wedding bonnet.”\n\n\nThe traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say,\n“There really was a time, then, when that monster was a maiden?”\n\n\nThénardier lied, however. When he had leased this paltry building for\nthe purpose of converting it into a tavern, he had found this chamber\ndecorated in just this manner, and had purchased the furniture and\nobtained the orange flowers at second hand, with the idea that this\nwould cast a graceful shadow on “his spouse,” and would result in what\nthe English call respectability for his house.\n\nWhen the traveller turned round, the host had disappeared. Thénardier\nhad withdrawn discreetly, without venturing to wish him a good night,\nas he did not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom he\nproposed to fleece royally the following morning.\n\nThe inn-keeper retired to his room. His wife was in bed, but she was\nnot asleep. When she heard her husband’s step she turned over and said\nto him:—\n\n“Do you know, I’m going to turn Cosette out of doors to-morrow.”\n\n\nThénardier replied coldly:—\n\n“How you do go on!”\n\n\nThey exchanged no further words, and a few moments later their candle\nwas extinguished.\n\nAs for the traveller, he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in a\ncorner. The landlord once gone, he threw himself into an armchair and\nremained for some time buried in thought. Then he removed his shoes,\ntook one of the two candles, blew out the other, opened the door, and\nquitted the room, gazing about him like a person who is in search of\nsomething. He traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase. There he\nheard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child. He\nfollowed this sound, and came to a sort of triangular recess built\nunder the staircase, or rather formed by the staircase itself. This\nrecess was nothing else than the space under the steps. There, in the\nmidst of all sorts of old papers and potsherds, among dust and spiders’\nwebs, was a bed—if one can call by the name of bed a straw pallet so\nfull of holes as to display the straw, and a coverlet so tattered as to\nshow the pallet. No sheets. This was placed on the floor.\n\nIn this bed Cosette was sleeping.\n\nThe man approached and gazed down upon her.\n\nCosette was in a profound sleep; she was fully dressed. In the winter\nshe did not undress, in order that she might not be so cold.\n\nAgainst her breast was pressed the doll, whose large eyes, wide open,\nglittered in the dark. From time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh\nas though she were on the point of waking, and she strained the doll\nalmost convulsively in her arms. Beside her bed there was only one of\nher wooden shoes.\n\nA door which stood open near Cosette’s pallet permitted a view of a\nrather large, dark room. The stranger stepped into it. At the further\nextremity, through a glass door, he saw two small, very white beds.\nThey belonged to Éponine and Azelma. Behind these beds, and half\nhidden, stood an uncurtained wicker cradle, in which the little boy who\nhad cried all the evening lay asleep.\n\nThe stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of the\nThénardier pair. He was on the point of retreating when his eye fell\nupon the fireplace—one of those vast tavern chimneys where there is\nalways so little fire when there is any fire at all, and which are so\ncold to look at. There was no fire in this one, there was not even\nashes; but there was something which attracted the stranger’s gaze,\nnevertheless. It was two tiny children’s shoes, coquettish in shape and\nunequal in size. The traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial\ncustom in accordance with which children place their shoes in the\nchimney on Christmas eve, there to await in the darkness some sparkling\ngift from their good fairy. Éponine and Azelma had taken care not to\nomit this, and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth.\n\nThe traveller bent over them.\n\nThe fairy, that is to say, their mother, had already paid her visit,\nand in each he saw a brand-new and shining ten-sou piece.\n\nThe man straightened himself up, and was on the point of withdrawing,\nwhen far in, in the darkest corner of the hearth, he caught sight of\nanother object. He looked at it, and recognized a wooden shoe, a\nfrightful shoe of the coarsest description, half dilapidated and all\ncovered with ashes and dried mud. It was Cosette’s sabot. Cosette, with\nthat touching trust of childhood, which can always be deceived yet\nnever discouraged, had placed her shoe on the hearth-stone also.\n\nHope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet and\ntouching thing.\n\nThere was nothing in this wooden shoe.\n\nThe stranger fumbled in his waistcoat, bent over and placed a louis\nd’or in Cosette’s shoe.\n\nThen he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX— THÉNARDIER AND HIS MANŒUVRES\n\n\nOn the following morning, two hours at least before day-break,\nThénardier, seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern,\npen in hand, was making out the bill for the traveller with the yellow\ncoat.\n\nHis wife, standing beside him, and half bent over him, was following\nhim with her eyes. They exchanged not a word. On the one hand, there\nwas profound meditation, on the other, the religious admiration with\nwhich one watches the birth and development of a marvel of the human\nmind. A noise was audible in the house; it was the Lark sweeping the\nstairs.\n\nAfter the lapse of a good quarter of an hour, and some erasures,\nThénardier produced the following masterpiece:—\n\nBILL OF THE GENTLEMAN IN No. 1.\n\nSupper . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     3 francs.\nChamber  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    10   ”\n Candle . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     5   ”\n Fire . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     4   ”\n Service  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     1   ”\n —————\nTotal . . . . . .    23 francs.\n\n\nService was written _servisse_.\n\n“Twenty-three francs!” cried the woman, with an enthusiasm which was\nmingled with some hesitation.\n\nLike all great artists, Thénardier was dissatisfied.\n\n“Peuh!” he exclaimed.\n\nIt was the accent of Castlereagh auditing France’s bill at the Congress\nof Vienna.\n\n“Monsieur Thénardier, you are right; he certainly owes that,” murmured\nthe wife, who was thinking of the doll bestowed on Cosette in the\npresence of her daughters. “It is just, but it is too much. He will not\npay it.”\n\n\nThénardier laughed coldly, as usual, and said:—\n\n“He will pay.”\n\n\nThis laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority. That\nwhich was asserted in this manner must needs be so. His wife did not\ninsist.\n\nShe set about arranging the table; her husband paced the room. A moment\nlater he added:—\n\n“I owe full fifteen hundred francs!”\n\n\nHe went and seated himself in the chimney-corner, meditating, with his\nfeet among the warm ashes.\n\n“Ah! by the way,” resumed his wife, “you don’t forget that I’m going to\nturn Cosette out of doors to-day? The monster! She breaks my heart with\nthat doll of hers! I’d rather marry Louis XVIII. than keep her another\nday in the house!”\n\n\nThénardier lighted his pipe, and replied between two puffs:—\n\n“You will hand that bill to the man.”\n\n\nThen he went out.\n\nHardly had he left the room when the traveller entered.\n\nThénardier instantly reappeared behind him and remained motionless in\nthe half-open door, visible only to his wife.\n\nThe yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand.\n\n“Up so early?” said Madame Thénardier; “is Monsieur leaving us\nalready?”\n\n\nAs she spoke thus, she was twisting the bill about in her hands with an\nembarrassed air, and making creases in it with her nails. Her hard face\npresented a shade which was not habitual with it,—timidity and\nscruples.\n\nTo present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air “of a\npoor wretch” seemed difficult to her.\n\nThe traveller appeared to be preoccupied and absent-minded. He\nreplied:—\n\n“Yes, Madame, I am going.”\n\n\n“So Monsieur has no business in Montfermeil?”\n\n\n“No, I was passing through. That is all. What do I owe you, Madame,” he\nadded.\n\nThe Thénardier silently handed him the folded bill.\n\nThe man unfolded the paper and glanced at it; but his thoughts were\nevidently elsewhere.\n\n“Madame,” he resumed, “is business good here in Montfermeil?”\n\n\n“So so, Monsieur,” replied the Thénardier, stupefied at not witnessing\nanother sort of explosion.\n\nShe continued, in a dreary and lamentable tone:—\n\n“Oh! Monsieur, times are so hard! and then, we have so few bourgeois in\nthe neighborhood! All the people are poor, you see. If we had not, now\nand then, some rich and generous travellers like Monsieur, we should\nnot get along at all. We have so many expenses. Just see, that child is\ncosting us our very eyes.”\n\n\n“What child?”\n\n\n“Why, the little one, you know! Cosette—the Lark, as she is called\nhereabouts!”\n\n\n“Ah!” said the man.\n\nShe went on:—\n\n“How stupid these peasants are with their nicknames! She has more the\nair of a bat than of a lark. You see, sir, we do not ask charity, and\nwe cannot bestow it. We earn nothing and we have to pay out a great\ndeal. The license, the imposts, the door and window tax, the\nhundredths! Monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible\ndeal of money. And then, I have my daughters. I have no need to bring\nup other people’s children.”\n\n\nThe man resumed, in that voice which he strove to render indifferent,\nand in which there lingered a tremor:—\n\n“What if one were to rid you of her?”\n\n\n“Who? Cosette?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\nThe landlady’s red and violent face brightened up hideously.\n\n“Ah! sir, my dear sir, take her, keep her, lead her off, carry her\naway, sugar her, stuff her with truffles, drink her, eat her, and the\nblessings of the good holy Virgin and of all the saints of paradise be\nupon you!”\n\n\n“Agreed.”\n\n\n“Really! You will take her away?”\n\n\n“I will take her away.”\n\n\n“Immediately?”\n\n\n“Immediately. Call the child.”\n\n\n“Cosette!” screamed the Thénardier.\n\n“In the meantime,” pursued the man, “I will pay you what I owe you. How\nmuch is it?”\n\n\nHe cast a glance on the bill, and could not restrain a start of\nsurprise:—\n\n“Twenty-three francs!”\n\n\nHe looked at the landlady, and repeated:—\n\n“Twenty-three francs?”\n\n\nThere was in the enunciation of these words, thus repeated, an accent\nbetween an exclamation and an interrogation point.\n\nThe Thénardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock. She\nreplied, with assurance:—\n\n“Good gracious, yes, sir, it is twenty-three francs.”\n\n\nThe stranger laid five five-franc pieces on the table.\n\n“Go and get the child,” said he.\n\nAt that moment Thénardier advanced to the middle of the room, and\nsaid:—\n\n“Monsieur owes twenty-six sous.”\n\n\n“Twenty-six sous!” exclaimed his wife.\n\n“Twenty sous for the chamber,” resumed Thénardier, coldly, “and six\nsous for his supper. As for the child, I must discuss that matter a\nlittle with the gentleman. Leave us, wife.”\n\n\nMadame Thénardier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpected\nlightning flashes of talent. She was conscious that a great actor was\nmaking his entrance on the stage, uttered not a word in reply, and left\nthe room.\n\nAs soon as they were alone, Thénardier offered the traveller a chair.\nThe traveller seated himself; Thénardier remained standing, and his\nface assumed a singular expression of good-fellowship and simplicity.\n\n“Sir,” said he, “what I have to say to you is this, that I adore that\nchild.”\n\n\nThe stranger gazed intently at him.\n\n“What child?”\n\n\nThénardier continued:—\n\n“How strange it is, one grows attached. What money is that? Take back\nyour hundred-sou piece. I adore the child.”\n\n\n“Whom do you mean?” demanded the stranger.\n\n“Eh! our little Cosette! Are you not intending to take her away from\nus? Well, I speak frankly; as true as you are an honest man, I will not\nconsent to it. I shall miss that child. I saw her first when she was a\ntiny thing. It is true that she costs us money; it is true that she has\nher faults; it is true that we are not rich; it is true that I have\npaid out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her\nillnesses! But one must do something for the good God’s sake. She has\nneither father nor mother. I have brought her up. I have bread enough\nfor her and for myself. In truth, I think a great deal of that child.\nYou understand, one conceives an affection for a person; I am a good\nsort of a beast, I am; I do not reason; I love that little girl; my\nwife is quick-tempered, but she loves her also. You see, she is just\nthe same as our own child. I want to keep her to babble about the\nhouse.”\n\n\nThe stranger kept his eye intently fixed on Thénardier. The latter\ncontinued:—\n\n“Excuse me, sir, but one does not give away one’s child to a passer-by,\nlike that. I am right, am I not? Still, I don’t say—you are rich; you\nhave the air of a very good man,—if it were for her happiness. But one\nmust find out that. You understand: suppose that I were to let her go\nand to sacrifice myself, I should like to know what becomes of her; I\nshould not wish to lose sight of her; I should like to know with whom\nshe is living, so that I could go to see her from time to time; so that\nshe may know that her good foster-father is alive, that he is watching\nover her. In short, there are things which are not possible. I do not\neven know your name. If you were to take her away, I should say: ‘Well,\nand the Lark, what has become of her?’ One must, at least, see some\npetty scrap of paper, some trifle in the way of a passport, you know!”\n\n\nThe stranger, still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates, as\nthe saying goes, to the very depths of the conscience, replied in a\ngrave, firm voice:—\n\n“Monsieur Thénardier, one does not require a passport to travel five\nleagues from Paris. If I take Cosette away, I shall take her away, and\nthat is the end of the matter. You will not know my name, you will not\nknow my residence, you will not know where she is; and my intention is\nthat she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives. I\nbreak the thread which binds her foot, and she departs. Does that suit\nyou? Yes or no?”\n\n\nSince geniuses, like demons, recognize the presence of a superior God\nby certain signs, Thénardier comprehended that he had to deal with a\nvery strong person. It was like an intuition; he comprehended it with\nhis clear and sagacious promptitude. While drinking with the carters,\nsmoking, and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening, he had\ndevoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger, watching him\nlike a cat, and studying him like a mathematician. He had watched him,\nboth on his own account, for the pleasure of the thing, and through\ninstinct, and had spied upon him as though he had been paid for so\ndoing. Not a movement, not a gesture, on the part of the man in the\nyellow great-coat had escaped him. Even before the stranger had so\nclearly manifested his interest in Cosette, Thénardier had divined his\npurpose. He had caught the old man’s deep glances returning constantly\nto the child. Who was this man? Why this interest? Why this hideous\ncostume, when he had so much money in his purse? Questions which he put\nto himself without being able to solve them, and which irritated him.\nHe had pondered it all night long. He could not be Cosette’s father.\nWas he her grandfather? Then why not make himself known at once? When\none has a right, one asserts it. This man evidently had no right over\nCosette. What was it, then? Thénardier lost himself in conjectures. He\ncaught glimpses of everything, but he saw nothing. Be that as it may,\non entering into conversation with the man, sure that there was some\nsecret in the case, that the latter had some interest in remaining in\nthe shadow, he felt himself strong; when he perceived from the\nstranger’s clear and firm retort, that this mysterious personage was\nmysterious in so simple a way, he became conscious that he was weak. He\nhad expected nothing of the sort. His conjectures were put to the rout.\nHe rallied his ideas. He weighed everything in the space of a second.\nThénardier was one of those men who take in a situation at a glance. He\ndecided that the moment had arrived for proceeding straightforward, and\nquickly at that. He did as great leaders do at the decisive moment,\nwhich they know that they alone recognize; he abruptly unmasked his\nbatteries.\n\n“Sir,” said he, “I am in need of fifteen hundred francs.”\n\n\nThe stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of black\nleather, opened it, drew out three bank-bills, which he laid on the\ntable. Then he placed his large thumb on the notes and said to the\ninn-keeper:—\n\n“Go and fetch Cosette.”\n\n\nWhile this was taking place, what had Cosette been doing?\n\nOn waking up, Cosette had run to get her shoe. In it she had found the\ngold piece. It was not a Napoleon; it was one of those perfectly new\ntwenty-franc pieces of the Restoration, on whose effigy the little\nPrussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath. Cosette was dazzled. Her\ndestiny began to intoxicate her. She did not know what a gold piece\nwas; she had never seen one; she hid it quickly in her pocket, as\nthough she had stolen it. Still, she felt that it really was hers; she\nguessed whence her gift had come, but the joy which she experienced was\nfull of fear. She was happy; above all she was stupefied. Such\nmagnificent and beautiful things did not appear real. The doll\nfrightened her, the gold piece frightened her. She trembled vaguely in\nthe presence of this magnificence. The stranger alone did not frighten\nher. On the contrary, he reassured her. Ever since the preceding\nevening, amid all her amazement, even in her sleep, she had been\nthinking in her little childish mind of that man who seemed to be so\npoor and so sad, and who was so rich and so kind. Everything had\nchanged for her since she had met that good man in the forest. Cosette,\nless happy than the most insignificant swallow of heaven, had never\nknown what it was to take refuge under a mother’s shadow and under a\nwing. For the last five years, that is to say, as far back as her\nmemory ran, the poor child had shivered and trembled. She had always\nbeen exposed completely naked to the sharp wind of adversity; now it\nseemed to her she was clothed. Formerly her soul had seemed cold, now\nit was warm. Cosette was no longer afraid of the Thénardier. She was no\nlonger alone; there was some one there.\n\nShe hastily set about her regular morning duties. That louis, which she\nhad about her, in the very apron pocket whence the fifteen-sou piece\nhad fallen on the night before, distracted her thoughts. She dared not\ntouch it, but she spent five minutes in gazing at it, with her tongue\nhanging out, if the truth must be told. As she swept the staircase, she\npaused, remained standing there motionless, forgetful of her broom and\nof the entire universe, occupied in gazing at that star which was\nblazing at the bottom of her pocket.\n\nIt was during one of these periods of contemplation that the Thénardier\njoined her. She had gone in search of Cosette at her husband’s orders.\nWhat was quite unprecedented, she neither struck her nor said an\ninsulting word to her.\n\n“Cosette,” she said, almost gently, “come immediately.”\n\n\nAn instant later Cosette entered the public room.\n\nThe stranger took up the bundle which he had brought and untied it.\nThis bundle contained a little woollen gown, an apron, a fustian\nbodice, a kerchief, a petticoat, woollen stockings, shoes—a complete\noutfit for a girl of seven years. All was black.\n\n“My child,” said the man, “take these, and go and dress yourself\nquickly.”\n\n\nDaylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of Montfermeil who\nhad begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man leading a\nlittle girl dressed in mourning, and carrying a pink doll in her arms,\npass along the road to Paris. They were going in the direction of\nLivry.\n\nIt was our man and Cosette.\n\nNo one knew the man; as Cosette was no longer in rags, many did not\nrecognize her. Cosette was going away. With whom? She did not know.\nWhither? She knew not. All that she understood was that she was leaving\nthe Thénardier tavern behind her. No one had thought of bidding her\nfarewell, nor had she thought of taking leave of any one. She was\nleaving that hated and hating house.\n\nPoor, gentle creature, whose heart had been repressed up to that hour!\n\nCosette walked along gravely, with her large eyes wide open, and gazing\nat the sky. She had put her louis in the pocket of her new apron. From\ntime to time, she bent down and glanced at it; then she looked at the\ngood man. She felt something as though she were beside the good God.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X—HE WHO SEEKS TO BETTER HIMSELF MAY RENDER HIS SITUATION WORSE\n\n\nMadame Thénardier had allowed her husband to have his own way, as was\nher wont. She had expected great results. When the man and Cosette had\ntaken their departure, Thénardier allowed a full quarter of an hour to\nelapse; then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundred\nfrancs.\n\n“Is that all?” said she.\n\nIt was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she had\ndared to criticise one of the master’s acts.\n\nThe blow told.\n\n“You are right, in sooth,” said he; “I am a fool. Give me my hat.”\n\n\nHe folded up the three bank-bills, thrust them into his pocket, and ran\nout in all haste; but he made a mistake and turned to the right first.\nSome neighbors, of whom he made inquiries, put him on the track again;\nthe Lark and the man had been seen going in the direction of Livry. He\nfollowed these hints, walking with great strides, and talking to\nhimself the while:—\n\n“That man is evidently a million dressed in yellow, and I am an animal.\nFirst he gave twenty sous, then five francs, then fifty francs, then\nfifteen hundred francs, all with equal readiness. He would have given\nfifteen thousand francs. But I shall overtake him.”\n\n\nAnd then, that bundle of clothes prepared beforehand for the child; all\nthat was singular; many mysteries lay concealed under it. One does not\nlet mysteries out of one’s hand when one has once grasped them. The\nsecrets of the wealthy are sponges of gold; one must know how to\nsubject them to pressure. All these thoughts whirled through his brain.\n“I am an animal,” said he.\n\nWhen one leaves Montfermeil and reaches the turn which the road takes\nthat runs to Livry, it can be seen stretching out before one to a great\ndistance across the plateau. On arriving there, he calculated that he\nought to be able to see the old man and the child. He looked as far as\nhis vision reached, and saw nothing. He made fresh inquiries, but he\nhad wasted time. Some passers-by informed him that the man and child of\nwhom he was in search had gone towards the forest in the direction of\nGagny. He hastened in that direction.\n\nThey were far in advance of him; but a child walks slowly, and he\nwalked fast; and then, he was well acquainted with the country.\n\nAll at once he paused and dealt himself a blow on his forehead like a\nman who has forgotten some essential point and who is ready to retrace\nhis steps.\n\n“I ought to have taken my gun,” said he to himself.\n\nThénardier was one of those double natures which sometimes pass through\nour midst without our being aware of the fact, and who disappear\nwithout our finding them out, because destiny has only exhibited one\nside of them. It is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged.\nIn a calm and even situation, Thénardier possessed all that is required\nto make—we will not say to be—what people have agreed to call an honest\ntrader, a good bourgeois. At the same time certain circumstances being\ngiven, certain shocks arriving to bring his under-nature to the\nsurface, he had all the requisites for a blackguard. He was a\nshopkeeper in whom there was some taint of the monster. Satan must have\noccasionally crouched down in some corner of the hovel in which\nThénardier dwelt, and have fallen a-dreaming in the presence of this\nhideous masterpiece.\n\nAfter a momentary hesitation:—\n\n“Bah!” he thought; “they will have time to make their escape.”\n\n\nAnd he pursued his road, walking rapidly straight ahead, and with\nalmost an air of certainty, with the sagacity of a fox scenting a covey\nof partridges.\n\nIn truth, when he had passed the ponds and had traversed in an oblique\ndirection the large clearing which lies on the right of the Avenue de\nBellevue, and reached that turf alley which nearly makes the circuit of\nthe hill, and covers the arch of the ancient aqueduct of the Abbey of\nChelles, he caught sight, over the top of the brushwood, of the hat on\nwhich he had already erected so many conjectures; it was that man’s\nhat. The brushwood was not high. Thénardier recognized the fact that\nthe man and Cosette were sitting there. The child could not be seen on\naccount of her small size, but the head of her doll was visible.\n\nThénardier was not mistaken. The man was sitting there, and letting\nCosette get somewhat rested. The inn-keeper walked round the brushwood\nand presented himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was in\nsearch of.\n\n“Pardon, excuse me, sir,” he said, quite breathless, “but here are your\nfifteen hundred francs.”\n\n\nSo saying, he handed the stranger the three bank-bills.\n\nThe man raised his eyes.\n\n“What is the meaning of this?”\n\n\nThénardier replied respectfully:—\n\n“It means, sir, that I shall take back Cosette.”\n\n\nCosette shuddered, and pressed close to the old man.\n\nHe replied, gazing to the very bottom of Thénardier’s eyes the while,\nand enunciating every syllable distinctly:—\n\n“You are go-ing to take back Co-sette?”\n\n\n“Yes, sir, I am. I will tell you; I have considered the matter. In\nfact, I have not the right to give her to you. I am an honest man, you\nsee; this child does not belong to me; she belongs to her mother. It\nwas her mother who confided her to me; I can only resign her to her\nmother. You will say to me, ‘But her mother is dead.’ Good; in that\ncase I can only give the child up to the person who shall bring me a\nwriting, signed by her mother, to the effect that I am to hand the\nchild over to the person therein mentioned; that is clear.”\n\n\nThe man, without making any reply, fumbled in his pocket, and\nThénardier beheld the pocket-book of bank-bills make its appearance\nonce more.\n\nThe tavern-keeper shivered with joy.\n\n“Good!” thought he; “let us hold firm; he is going to bribe me!”\n\n\nBefore opening the pocket-book, the traveller cast a glance about him:\nthe spot was absolutely deserted; there was not a soul either in the\nwoods or in the valley. The man opened his pocket-book once more and\ndrew from it, not the handful of bills which Thénardier expected, but a\nsimple little paper, which he unfolded and presented fully open to the\ninn-keeper, saying:—\n\n“You are right; read!”\n\n\nThénardier took the paper and read:—\n\n“M. SUR M., March 25, 1823.\n\n“MONSIEUR THÉNARDIER:—\n\nYou will deliver Cosette to this person.\nYou will be paid for all the little things.\nI have the honor to salute you with respect,\nFANTINE.”\n\n\n“You know that signature?” resumed the man.\n\nIt certainly was Fantine’s signature; Thénardier recognized it.\n\nThere was no reply to make; he experienced two violent vexations, the\nvexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for, and the\nvexation of being beaten; the man added:—\n\n“You may keep this paper as your receipt.”\n\n\nThénardier retreated in tolerably good order.\n\n“This signature is fairly well imitated,” he growled between his teeth;\n“however, let it go!”\n\n\nThen he essayed a desperate effort.\n\n“It is well, sir,” he said, “since you are the person, but I must be\npaid for all those little things. A great deal is owing to me.”\n\n\nThe man rose to his feet, filliping the dust from his threadbare\nsleeve:—\n\n“Monsieur Thénardier, in January last, the mother reckoned that she\nowed you one hundred and twenty francs. In February, you sent her a\nbill of five hundred francs; you received three hundred francs at the\nend of February, and three hundred francs at the beginning of March.\nSince then nine months have elapsed, at fifteen francs a month, the\nprice agreed upon, which makes one hundred and thirty-five francs. You\nhad received one hundred francs too much; that makes thirty-five still\nowing you. I have just given you fifteen hundred francs.”\n\n\nThénardier’s sensations were those of the wolf at the moment when he\nfeels himself nipped and seized by the steel jaw of the trap.\n\n“Who is this devil of a man?” he thought.\n\nHe did what the wolf does: he shook himself. Audacity had succeeded\nwith him once.\n\n“Monsieur-I-don’t-know-your-name,” he said resolutely, and this time\ncasting aside all respectful ceremony, “I shall take back Cosette if\nyou do not give me a thousand crowns.”\n\n\nThe stranger said tranquilly:—\n\n“Come, Cosette.”\n\n\nHe took Cosette by his left hand, and with his right he picked up his\ncudgel, which was lying on the ground.\n\nThénardier noted the enormous size of the cudgel and the solitude of\nthe spot.\n\nThe man plunged into the forest with the child, leaving the inn-keeper\nmotionless and speechless.\n\nWhile they were walking away, Thénardier scrutinized his huge\nshoulders, which were a little rounded, and his great fists.\n\nThen, bringing his eyes back to his own person, they fell upon his\nfeeble arms and his thin hands. “I really must have been exceedingly\nstupid not to have thought to bring my gun,” he said to himself, “since\nI was going hunting!”\n\n\nHowever, the inn-keeper did not give up.\n\n“I want to know where he is going,” said he, and he set out to follow\nthem at a distance. Two things were left on his hands, an irony in the\nshape of the paper signed _Fantine_, and a consolation, the fifteen\nhundred francs.\n\nThe man led Cosette off in the direction of Livry and Bondy. He walked\nslowly, with drooping head, in an attitude of reflection and sadness.\nThe winter had thinned out the forest, so that Thénardier did not lose\nthem from sight, although he kept at a good distance. The man turned\nround from time to time, and looked to see if he was being followed.\nAll at once he caught sight of Thénardier. He plunged suddenly into the\nbrushwood with Cosette, where they could both hide themselves. “The\ndeuce!” said Thénardier, and he redoubled his pace.\n\nThe thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them.\nWhen the man had reached the densest part of the thicket, he wheeled\nround. It was in vain that Thénardier sought to conceal himself in the\nbranches; he could not prevent the man seeing him. The man cast upon\nhim an uneasy glance, then elevated his head and continued his course.\nThe inn-keeper set out again in pursuit. Thus they continued for two or\nthree hundred paces. All at once the man turned round once more; he saw\nthe inn-keeper. This time he gazed at him with so sombre an air that\nThénardier decided that it was “useless” to proceed further. Thénardier\nretraced his steps.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI—NUMBER 9,430 REAPPEARS, AND COSETTE WINS IT IN THE LOTTERY\n\n\nJean Valjean was not dead.\n\nWhen he fell into the sea, or rather, when he threw himself into it, he\nwas not ironed, as we have seen. He swam under water until he reached a\nvessel at anchor, to which a boat was moored. He found means of hiding\nhimself in this boat until night. At night he swam off again, and\nreached the shore a little way from Cape Brun. There, as he did not\nlack money, he procured clothing. A small country-house in the\nneighborhood of Balaguier was at that time the dressing-room of escaped\nconvicts,—a lucrative specialty. Then Jean Valjean, like all the sorry\nfugitives who are seeking to evade the vigilance of the law and social\nfatality, pursued an obscure and undulating itinerary. He found his\nfirst refuge at Pradeaux, near Beausset. Then he directed his course\ntowards Grand-Villard, near Briançon, in the Hautes-Alpes. It was a\nfumbling and uneasy flight,—a mole’s track, whose branchings are\nuntraceable. Later on, some trace of his passage into Ain, in the\nterritory of Civrieux, was discovered; in the Pyrenees, at Accons; at\nthe spot called Grange-de-Doumec, near the market of Chavailles, and in\nthe environs of Perigueux at Brunies, canton of La Chapelle-Gonaguet.\nHe reached Paris. We have just seen him at Montfermeil.\n\nHis first care on arriving in Paris had been to buy mourning clothes\nfor a little girl of from seven to eight years of age; then to procure\na lodging. That done, he had betaken himself to Montfermeil. It will be\nremembered that already, during his preceding escape, he had made a\nmysterious trip thither, or somewhere in that neighborhood, of which\nthe law had gathered an inkling.\n\nHowever, he was thought to be dead, and this still further increased\nthe obscurity which had gathered about him. At Paris, one of the\njournals which chronicled the fact fell into his hands. He felt\nreassured and almost at peace, as though he had really been dead.\n\nOn the evening of the day when Jean Valjean rescued Cosette from the\nclaws of the Thénardiers, he returned to Paris. He re-entered it at\nnightfall, with the child, by way of the Barrier Monceaux. There he\nentered a cabriolet, which took him to the esplanade of the\nObservatoire. There he got out, paid the coachman, took Cosette by the\nhand, and together they directed their steps through the\ndarkness,—through the deserted streets which adjoin the Ourcine and the\nGlacière, towards the Boulevard de l’Hôpital.\n\nThe day had been strange and filled with emotions for Cosette. They had\neaten some bread and cheese purchased in isolated taverns, behind\nhedges; they had changed carriages frequently; they had travelled short\ndistances on foot. She made no complaint, but she was weary, and Jean\nValjean perceived it by the way she dragged more and more on his hand\nas she walked. He took her on his back. Cosette, without letting go of\nCatherine, laid her head on Jean Valjean’s shoulder, and there fell\nasleep.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTH—THE GORBEAU HOVEL\n\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nThe Gorbeau Hovel  2b3-10-gorbeau-house\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—MASTER GORBEAU\n\n\nForty years ago, a rambler who had ventured into that unknown country\nof the Salpêtrière, and who had mounted to the Barrière d’Italie by way\nof the boulevard, reached a point where it might be said that Paris\ndisappeared. It was no longer solitude, for there were passers-by; it\nwas not the country, for there were houses and streets; it was not the\ncity, for the streets had ruts like highways, and the grass grew in\nthem; it was not a village, the houses were too lofty. What was it,\nthen? It was an inhabited spot where there was no one; it was a desert\nplace where there was some one; it was a boulevard of the great city, a\nstreet of Paris; more wild at night than the forest, more gloomy by day\nthan a cemetery.\n\nIt was the old quarter of the Marché-aux-Chevaux.\n\nThe rambler, if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of\nthis Marché-aux-Chevaux; if he consented even to pass beyond the Rue du\nPetit-Banquier, after leaving on his right a garden protected by high\nwalls; then a field in which tan-bark mills rose like gigantic beaver\nhuts; then an enclosure encumbered with timber, with a heap of stumps,\nsawdust, and shavings, on which stood a large dog, barking; then a\nlong, low, utterly dilapidated wall, with a little black door in\nmourning, laden with mosses, which were covered with flowers in the\nspring; then, in the most deserted spot, a frightful and decrepit\nbuilding, on which ran the inscription in large letters: POST NO\nBILLS,—this daring rambler would have reached little known latitudes at\nthe corner of the Rue des Vignes-Saint-Marcel. There, near a factory,\nand between two garden walls, there could be seen, at that epoch, a\nmean building, which, at the first glance, seemed as small as a\nthatched hovel, and which was, in reality, as large as a cathedral. It\npresented its side and gable to the public road; hence its apparent\ndiminutiveness. Nearly the whole of the house was hidden. Only the door\nand one window could be seen.\n\nThis hovel was only one story high.\n\nThe first detail that struck the observer was, that the door could\nnever have been anything but the door of a hovel, while the window, if\nit had been carved out of dressed stone instead of being in rough\nmasonry, might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion.\n\nThe door was nothing but a collection of worm-eaten planks roughly\nbound together by cross-beams which resembled roughly hewn logs. It\nopened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps, muddy, chalky,\nplaster-stained, dusty steps, of the same width as itself, which could\nbe seen from the street, running straight up like a ladder and\ndisappearing in the darkness between two walls. The top of the\nshapeless bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow\nscantling in the centre of which a triangular hole had been sawed,\nwhich served both as wicket and air-hole when the door was closed. On\nthe inside of the door the figures 52 had been traced with a couple of\nstrokes of a brush dipped in ink, and above the scantling the same hand\nhad daubed the number 50, so that one hesitated. Where was one? Above\nthe door it said, “Number 50”; the inside replied, “no, Number 52.” No\none knows what dust-colored figures were suspended like draperies from\nthe triangular opening.\n\nThe window was large, sufficiently elevated, garnished with Venetian\nblinds, and with a frame in large square panes; only these large panes\nwere suffering from various wounds, which were both concealed and\nbetrayed by an ingenious paper bandage. And the blinds, dislocated and\nunpasted, threatened passers-by rather than screened the occupants. The\nhorizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naïvely\nreplaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly; so that what began as a\nblind ended as a shutter. This door with an unclean, and this window\nwith an honest though dilapidated air, thus beheld on the same house,\nproduced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side,\nwith different miens beneath the same rags, the one having always been\na mendicant, and the other having once been a gentleman.\n\nThe staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed which\nhad been converted into a house. This edifice had, for its intestinal\ntube, a long corridor, on which opened to right and left sorts of\ncompartments of varied dimensions which were inhabitable under stress\nof circumstances, and rather more like stalls than cells. These\nchambers received their light from the vague waste grounds in the\nneighborhood.\n\nAll this was dark, disagreeable, wan, melancholy, sepulchral; traversed\naccording as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door, by cold rays\nor by icy winds. An interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this\nsort of dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders.\n\nTo the left of the entrance door, on the boulevard side, at about the\nheight of a man from the ground, a small window which had been walled\nup formed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown\nthere as they passed by.\n\nA portion of this building has recently been demolished. From what\nstill remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was in former\ndays. As a whole, it was not over a hundred years old. A hundred years\nis youth in a church and age in a house. It seems as though man’s\nlodging partook of his ephemeral character, and God’s house of his\neternity.\n\nThe postmen called the house Number 50-52; but it was known in the\nneighborhood as the Gorbeau house.\n\nLet us explain whence this appellation was derived.\n\nCollectors of petty details, who become herbalists of anecdotes, and\nprick slippery dates into their memories with a pin, know that there\nwas in Paris, during the last century, about 1770, two attorneys at the\nChâtelet named, one Corbeau (Raven), the other Renard (Fox). The two\nnames had been forestalled by La Fontaine. The opportunity was too fine\nfor the lawyers; they made the most of it. A parody was immediately put\nin circulation in the galleries of the court-house, in verses that\nlimped a little:—\n\nMaître Corbeau, sur un dossier perché,\nTenait dans son bec une saisie exécutoire;\nMaître Renard, par l’odeur alléché,\nLui fit à peu près cette histoire:\nHé! bonjour.  Etc.13\n\n\n\nThe two honest practitioners, embarrassed by the jests, and finding the\nbearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter which\nfollowed them, resolved to get rid of their names, and hit upon the\nexpedient of applying to the king.\n\nTheir petition was presented to Louis XV. on the same day when the\nPapal Nuncio, on the one hand, and the Cardinal de la Roche-Aymon on\nthe other, both devoutly kneeling, were each engaged in putting on, in\nhis Majesty’s presence, a slipper on the bare feet of Madame du Barry,\nwho had just got out of bed. The king, who was laughing, continued to\nlaugh, passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers, and\nbestowed on these limbs of the law their former names, or nearly so. By\nthe kings command, Maître Corbeau was permitted to add a tail to his\ninitial letter and to call himself Gorbeau. Maître Renard was less\nlucky; all he obtained was leave to place a P in front of his R, and to\ncall himself Prenard; so that the second name bore almost as much\nresemblance as the first.\n\nNow, according to local tradition, this Maître Gorbeau had been the\nproprietor of the building numbered 50-52 on the Boulevard de\nl’Hôpital. He was even the author of the monumental window.\n\nHence the edifice bore the name of the Gorbeau house.\n\nOpposite this house, among the trees of the boulevard, rose a great elm\nwhich was three-quarters dead; almost directly facing it opens the Rue\nde la Barrière des Gobelins, a street then without houses, unpaved,\nplanted with unhealthy trees, which was green or muddy according to the\nseason, and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of Paris. An odor\nof copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory.\n\nThe barrier was close at hand. In 1823 the city wall was still in\nexistence.\n\nThis barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind. It was the road\nto Bicêtre. It was through it that, under the Empire and the\nRestoration, prisoners condemned to death re-entered Paris on the day\nof their execution. It was there, that, about 1829, was committed that\nmysterious assassination, called “The assassination of the\nFontainebleau barrier,” whose authors justice was never able to\ndiscover; a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated, a\nfrightful enigma which has never been unriddled. Take a few steps, and\nyou come upon that fatal Rue Croulebarbe, where Ulbach stabbed the\ngoat-girl of Ivry to the sound of thunder, as in the melodramas. A few\npaces more, and you arrive at the abominable pollarded elms of the\nBarrière Saint-Jacques, that expedient of the philanthropist to conceal\nthe scaffold, that miserable and shameful Place de Grève of a\nshop-keeping and bourgeois society, which recoiled before the death\npenalty, neither daring to abolish it with grandeur, nor to uphold it\nwith authority.\n\nLeaving aside this Place Saint-Jacques, which was, as it were,\npredestined, and which has always been horrible, probably the most\nmournful spot on that mournful boulevard, seven and thirty years ago,\nwas the spot which even to-day is so unattractive, where stood the\nbuilding Number 50-52.\n\nBourgeois houses only began to spring up there twenty-five years later.\nThe place was unpleasant. In addition to the gloomy thoughts which\nassailed one there, one was conscious of being between the Salpêtrière,\na glimpse of whose dome could be seen, and Bicêtre, whose outskirts one\nwas fairly touching; that is to say, between the madness of women and\nthe madness of men. As far as the eye could see, one could perceive\nnothing but the abattoirs, the city wall, and the fronts of a few\nfactories, resembling barracks or monasteries; everywhere about stood\nhovels, rubbish, ancient walls blackened like cerecloths, new white\nwalls like winding-sheets; everywhere parallel rows of trees, buildings\nerected on a line, flat constructions, long, cold rows, and the\nmelancholy sadness of right angles. Not an unevenness of the ground,\nnot a caprice in the architecture, not a fold. The _ensemble_ was\nglacial, regular, hideous. Nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry.\nIt is because symmetry is ennui, and ennui is at the very foundation of\ngrief. Despair yawns. Something more terrible than a hell where one\nsuffers may be imagined, and that is a hell where one is bored. If such\na hell existed, that bit of the Boulevard de l’Hôpital might have\nformed the entrance to it.\n\nNevertheless, at nightfall, at the moment when the daylight is\nvanishing, especially in winter, at the hour when the twilight breeze\ntears from the elms their last russet leaves, when the darkness is deep\nand starless, or when the moon and the wind are making openings in the\nclouds and losing themselves in the shadows, this boulevard suddenly\nbecomes frightful. The black lines sink inwards and are lost in the\nshades, like morsels of the infinite. The passer-by cannot refrain from\nrecalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected\nwith the gibbet. The solitude of this spot, where so many crimes have\nbeen committed, had something terrible about it. One almost had a\npresentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness; all the confused\nforms of the darkness seemed suspicious, and the long, hollow square,\nof which one caught a glimpse between each tree, seemed graves: by day\nit was ugly; in the evening melancholy; by night it was sinister.\n\nIn summer, at twilight, one saw, here and there, a few old women seated\nat the foot of the elm, on benches mouldy with rain. These good old\nwomen were fond of begging.\n\nHowever, this quarter, which had a superannuated rather than an antique\nair, was tending even then to transformation. Even at that time any one\nwho was desirous of seeing it had to make haste. Each day some detail\nof the whole effect was disappearing. For the last twenty years the\nstation of the Orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and\ndistracted it, as it does to-day. Wherever it is placed on the borders\nof a capital, a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth\nof a city. It seems as though, around these great centres of the\nmovements of a people, the earth, full of germs, trembled and yawned,\nto engulf the ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring\nforth, at the rattle of these powerful machines, at the breath of these\nmonstrous horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire. The\nold houses crumble and new ones rise.\n\nSince the Orleans railway has invaded the region of the Salpêtrière,\nthe ancient, narrow streets which adjoin the moats Saint-Victor and the\nJardin des Plantes tremble, as they are violently traversed three or\nfour times each day by those currents of coach fiacres and omnibuses\nwhich, in a given time, crowd back the houses to the right and the\nleft; for there are things which are odd when said that are rigorously\nexact; and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makes\nthe southern fronts of houses to vegetate and grow, it is certain that\nthe frequent passage of vehicles enlarges streets. The symptoms of a\nnew life are evident. In this old provincial quarter, in the wildest\nnooks, the pavement shows itself, the sidewalks begin to crawl and to\ngrow longer, even where there are as yet no pedestrians. One morning,—a\nmemorable morning in July, 1845,—black pots of bitumen were seen\nsmoking there; on that day it might be said that civilization had\narrived in the Rue de l’Ourcine, and that Paris had entered the suburb\nof Saint-Marceau.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—A NEST FOR OWL AND A WARBLER\n\n\nIt was in front of this Gorbeau house that Jean Valjean halted. Like\nwild birds, he had chosen this desert place to construct his nest.\n\nHe fumbled in his waistcoat pocket, drew out a sort of a pass-key,\nopened the door, entered, closed it again carefully, and ascended the\nstaircase, still carrying Cosette.\n\nAt the top of the stairs he drew from his pocket another key, with\nwhich he opened another door. The chamber which he entered, and which\nhe closed again instantly, was a kind of moderately spacious attic,\nfurnished with a mattress laid on the floor, a table, and several\nchairs; a stove in which a fire was burning, and whose embers were\nvisible, stood in one corner. A lantern on the boulevard cast a vague\nlight into this poor room. At the extreme end there was a dressing-room\nwith a folding bed; Jean Valjean carried the child to this bed and laid\nher down there without waking her.\n\nHe struck a match and lighted a candle. All this was prepared\nbeforehand on the table, and, as he had done on the previous evening,\nhe began to scrutinize Cosette’s face with a gaze full of ecstasy, in\nwhich the expression of kindness and tenderness almost amounted to\naberration. The little girl, with that tranquil confidence which\nbelongs only to extreme strength and extreme weakness, had fallen\nasleep without knowing with whom she was, and continued to sleep\nwithout knowing where she was.\n\nJean Valjean bent down and kissed that child’s hand.\n\nNine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother, who had also\njust fallen asleep.\n\nThe same sad, piercing, religious sentiment filled his heart.\n\nHe knelt beside Cosette’s bed.\n\nlt was broad daylight, and the child still slept. A wan ray of the\nDecember sun penetrated the window of the attic and lay upon the\nceiling in long threads of light and shade. All at once a heavily laden\ncarrier’s cart, which was passing along the boulevard, shook the frail\nbed, like a clap of thunder, and made it quiver from top to bottom.\n\n“Yes, madame!” cried Cosette, waking with a start, “here I am! here I\nam!”\n\n\nAnd she sprang out of bed, her eyes still half shut with the heaviness\nof sleep, extending her arms towards the corner of the wall.\n\n“Ah! mon Dieu, my broom!” said she.\n\nShe opened her eyes wide now, and beheld the smiling countenance of\nJean Valjean.\n\n“Ah! so it is true!” said the child. “Good morning, Monsieur.”\n\n\nChildren accept joy and happiness instantly and familiarly, being\nthemselves by nature joy and happiness.\n\nCosette caught sight of Catherine at the foot of her bed, and took\npossession of her, and, as she played, she put a hundred questions to\nJean Valjean. Where was she? Was Paris very large? Was Madame\nThénardier very far away? Was she to go back? etc., etc. All at once\nshe exclaimed, “How pretty it is here!”\n\n\nIt was a frightful hole, but she felt free.\n\n“Must I sweep?” she resumed at last.\n\n“Play!” said Jean Valjean.\n\nThe day passed thus. Cosette, without troubling herself to understand\nanything, was inexpressibly happy with that doll and that kind man.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—TWO MISFORTUNES MAKE ONE PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE\n\n\nOn the following morning, at daybreak, Jean Valjean was still by\nCosette’s bedside; he watched there motionless, waiting for her to\nwake.\n\nSome new thing had come into his soul.\n\nJean Valjean had never loved anything; for twenty-five years he had\nbeen alone in the world. He had never been father, lover, husband,\nfriend. In the prison he had been vicious, gloomy, chaste, ignorant,\nand shy. The heart of that ex-convict was full of virginity. His sister\nand his sister’s children had left him only a vague and far-off memory\nwhich had finally almost completely vanished; he had made every effort\nto find them, and not having been able to find them, he had forgotten\nthem. Human nature is made thus; the other tender emotions of his\nyouth, if he had ever had any, had fallen into an abyss.\n\nWhen he saw Cosette, when he had taken possession of her, carried her\noff, and delivered her, he felt his heart moved within him.\n\nAll the passion and affection within him awoke, and rushed towards that\nchild. He approached the bed, where she lay sleeping, and trembled with\njoy. He suffered all the pangs of a mother, and he knew not what it\nmeant; for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to\nlove is a very obscure and a very sweet thing.\n\nPoor old man, with a perfectly new heart!\n\nOnly, as he was five and fifty, and Cosette eight years of age, all\nthat might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed\ntogether into a sort of ineffable light.\n\nIt was the second white apparition which he had encountered. The Bishop\nhad caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon; Cosette caused\nthe dawn of love to rise.\n\nThe early days passed in this dazzled state.\n\nCosette, on her side, had also, unknown to herself, become another\nbeing, poor little thing! She was so little when her mother left her,\nthat she no longer remembered her. Like all children, who resemble\nyoung shoots of the vine, which cling to everything, she had tried to\nlove; she had not succeeded. All had repulsed her,—the Thénardiers,\ntheir children, other children. She had loved the dog, and he had died,\nafter which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her. It\nis a sad thing to say, and we have already intimated it, that, at eight\nyears of age, her heart was cold. It was not her fault; it was not the\nfaculty of loving that she lacked; alas! it was the possibility. Thus,\nfrom the very first day, all her sentient and thinking powers loved\nthis kind man. She felt that which she had never felt before—a\nsensation of expansion.\n\nThe man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor; she\nthought Jean Valjean handsome, just as she thought the hovel pretty.\n\nThese are the effects of the dawn, of childhood, of joy. The novelty of\nthe earth and of life counts for something here. Nothing is so charming\nas the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret. We all have in our\npast a delightful garret.\n\nNature, a difference of fifty years, had set a profound gulf between\nJean Valjean and Cosette; destiny filled in this gulf. Destiny suddenly\nunited and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted\nexistences, differing in age, alike in sorrow. One, in fact, completed\nthe other. Cosette’s instinct sought a father, as Jean Valjean’s\ninstinct sought a child. To meet was to find each other. At the\nmysterious moment when their hands touched, they were welded together.\nWhen these two souls perceived each other, they recognized each other\nas necessary to each other, and embraced each other closely.\n\nTaking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense, we may\nsay that, separated from every one by the walls of the tomb, Jean\nValjean was the widower, and Cosette was the orphan: this situation\ncaused Jean Valjean to become Cosette’s father after a celestial\nfashion.\n\nAnd in truth, the mysterious impression produced on Cosette in the\ndepths of the forest of Chelles by the hand of Jean Valjean grasping\nhers in the dark was not an illusion, but a reality. The entrance of\nthat man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of God.\n\nMoreover, Jean Valjean had chosen his refuge well. There he seemed\nperfectly secure.\n\nThe chamber with a dressing-room, which he occupied with Cosette, was\nthe one whose window opened on the boulevard. This being the only\nwindow in the house, no neighbors’ glances were to be feared from\nacross the way or at the side.\n\nThe ground floor of Number 50-52, a sort of dilapidated penthouse,\nserved as a wagon-house for market-gardeners, and no communication\nexisted between it and the first story. It was separated by the\nflooring, which had neither traps nor stairs, and which formed the\ndiaphragm of the building, as it were. The first story contained, as we\nhave said, numerous chambers and several attics, only one of which was\noccupied by the old woman who took charge of Jean Valjean’s\nhousekeeping; all the rest was uninhabited.\n\nIt was this old woman, ornamented with the name of the _principal\nlodger_, and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress, who\nhad let him the lodging on Christmas eve. He had represented himself to\nher as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by Spanish bonds, who\nwas coming there to live with his little daughter. He had paid her six\nmonths in advance, and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the\nchamber and dressing-room, as we have seen. It was this good woman who\nhad lighted the fire in the stove, and prepared everything on the\nevening of their arrival.\n\nWeek followed week; these two beings led a happy life in that hovel.\n\nCosette laughed, chattered, and sang from daybreak. Children have their\nmorning song as well as birds.\n\nIt sometimes happened that Jean Valjean clasped her tiny red hand, all\ncracked with chilblains, and kissed it. The poor child, who was used to\nbeing beaten, did not know the meaning of this, and ran away in\nconfusion.\n\nAt times she became serious and stared at her little black gown.\nCosette was no longer in rags; she was in mourning. She had emerged\nfrom misery, and she was entering into life.\n\nJean Valjean had undertaken to teach her to read. Sometimes, as he made\nthe child spell, he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil\nthat he had learned to read in prison. This idea had ended in teaching\na child to read. Then the ex-convict smiled with the pensive smile of\nthe angels.\n\nHe felt in it a premeditation from on high, the will of some one who\nwas not man, and he became absorbed in reverie. Good thoughts have\ntheir abysses as well as evil ones.\n\nTo teach Cosette to read, and to let her play, this constituted nearly\nthe whole of Jean Valjean’s existence. And then he talked of her\nmother, and he made her pray.\n\nShe called him _father_, and knew no other name for him.\n\nHe passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll, and\nin listening to her prattle. Life, henceforth, appeared to him to be\nfull of interest; men seemed to him good and just; he no longer\nreproached any one in thought; he saw no reason why he should not live\nto be a very old man, now that this child loved him. He saw a whole\nfuture stretching out before him, illuminated by Cosette as by a\ncharming light. The best of us are not exempt from egotistical\nthoughts. At times, he reflected with a sort of joy that she would be\nugly.\n\nThis is only a personal opinion; but, to utter our whole thought, at\nthe point where Jean Valjean had arrived when he began to love Cosette,\nit is by no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragement\nin order that he might persevere in well-doing. He had just viewed the\nmalice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect—incomplete\naspects, which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth, the\nfate of woman as summed up in Fantine, and public authority as\npersonified in Javert. He had returned to prison, this time for having\ndone right; he had quaffed fresh bitterness; disgust and lassitude were\noverpowering him; even the memory of the Bishop probably suffered a\ntemporary eclipse, though sure to reappear later on luminous and\ntriumphant; but, after all, that sacred memory was growing dim. Who\nknows whether Jean Valjean had not been on the eve of growing\ndiscouraged and of falling once more? He loved and grew strong again.\nAlas! he walked with no less indecision than Cosette. He protected her,\nand she strengthened him. Thanks to him, she could walk through life;\nthanks to her, he could continue in virtue. He was that child’s stay,\nand she was his prop. Oh, unfathomable and divine mystery of the\nbalances of destiny!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—THE REMARKS OF THE PRINCIPAL TENANT\n\n\nJean Valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day. Every evening,\nat twilight, he walked for an hour or two, sometimes alone, often with\nCosette, seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard, and\nentering churches at nightfall. He liked to go to Saint-Médard, which\nis the nearest church. When he did not take Cosette with him, she\nremained with the old woman; but the child’s delight was to go out with\nthe good man. She preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous\n_tête-à-têtes_ with Catherine. He held her hand as they walked, and\nsaid sweet things to her.\n\nIt turned out that Cosette was a very gay little person.\n\nThe old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went to\nmarket.\n\nThey lived soberly, always having a little fire, but like people in\nvery moderate circumstances. Jean Valjean had made no alterations in\nthe furniture as it was the first day; he had merely had the glass door\nleading to Cosette’s dressing-room replaced by a solid door.\n\nHe still wore his yellow coat, his black breeches, and his old hat. In\nthe street, he was taken for a poor man. It sometimes happened that\nkind-hearted women turned back to bestow a sou on him. Jean Valjean\naccepted the sou with a deep bow. It also happened occasionally that he\nencountered some poor wretch asking alms; then he looked behind him to\nmake sure that no one was observing him, stealthily approached the\nunfortunate man, put a piece of money into his hand, often a silver\ncoin, and walked rapidly away. This had its disadvantages. He began to\nbe known in the neighborhood under the name of _the beggar who gives\nalms_.\n\nThe old _principal lodger_, a cross-looking creature, who was\nthoroughly permeated, so far as her neighbors were concerned, with the\ninquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons, scrutinized Jean Valjean a\ngreat deal, without his suspecting the fact. She was a little deaf,\nwhich rendered her talkative. There remained to her from her past, two\nteeth,—one above, the other below,—which she was continually knocking\nagainst each other. She had questioned Cosette, who had not been able\nto tell her anything, since she knew nothing herself except that she\nhad come from Montfermeil. One morning, this spy saw Jean Valjean, with\nan air which struck the old gossip as peculiar, entering one of the\nuninhabited compartments of the hovel. She followed him with the step\nof an old cat, and was able to observe him without being seen, through\na crack in the door, which was directly opposite him. Jean Valjean had\nhis back turned towards this door, by way of greater security, no\ndoubt. The old woman saw him fumble in his pocket and draw thence a\ncase, scissors, and thread; then he began to rip the lining of one of\nthe skirts of his coat, and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish\npaper, which he unfolded. The old woman recognized, with terror, the\nfact that it was a bank-bill for a thousand francs. It was the second\nor third only that she had seen in the course of her existence. She\nfled in alarm.\n\nA moment later, Jean Valjean accosted her, and asked her to go and get\nthis thousand-franc bill changed for him, adding that it was his\nquarterly income, which he had received the day before. “Where?”\nthought the old woman. “He did not go out until six o’clock in the\nevening, and the government bank certainly is not open at that hour.”\nThe old woman went to get the bill changed, and mentioned her surmises.\nThat thousand-franc note, commented on and multiplied, produced a vast\namount of terrified discussion among the gossips of the Rue des Vignes\nSaint-Marcel.\n\nA few days later, it chanced that Jean Valjean was sawing some wood, in\nhis shirt-sleeves, in the corridor. The old woman was in the chamber,\nputting things in order. She was alone. Cosette was occupied in\nadmiring the wood as it was sawed. The old woman caught sight of the\ncoat hanging on a nail, and examined it. The lining had been sewed up\nagain. The good woman felt of it carefully, and thought she observed in\nthe skirts and revers thicknesses of paper. More thousand-franc\nbank-bills, no doubt!\n\nShe also noticed that there were all sorts of things in the pockets.\nNot only the needles, thread, and scissors which she had seen, but a\nbig pocket-book, a very large knife, and—a suspicious\ncircumstance—several wigs of various colors. Each pocket of this coat\nhad the air of being in a manner provided against unexpected accidents.\n\nThus the inhabitants of the house reached the last days of winter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—A FIVE-FRANC PIECE FALLS ON THE GROUND AND PRODUCES A TUMULT\n\n\nNear Saint-Médard’s church there was a poor man who was in the habit of\ncrouching on the brink of a public well which had been condemned, and\non whom Jean Valjean was fond of bestowing charity. He never passed\nthis man without giving him a few sous. Sometimes he spoke to him.\nThose who envied this mendicant said that he belonged to the police. He\nwas an ex-beadle of seventy-five, who was constantly mumbling his\nprayers.\n\nOne evening, as Jean Valjean was passing by, when he had not Cosette\nwith him, he saw the beggar in his usual place, beneath the lantern\nwhich had just been lighted. The man seemed engaged in prayer,\naccording to his custom, and was much bent over. Jean Valjean stepped\nup to him and placed his customary alms in his hand. The mendicant\nraised his eyes suddenly, stared intently at Jean Valjean, then dropped\nhis head quickly. This movement was like a flash of lightning. Jean\nValjean was seized with a shudder. It seemed to him that he had just\ncaught sight, by the light of the street lantern, not of the placid and\nbeaming visage of the old beadle, but of a well-known and startling\nface. He experienced the same impression that one would have on finding\none’s self, all of a sudden, face to face, in the dark, with a tiger.\nHe recoiled, terrified, petrified, daring neither to breathe, to speak,\nto remain, nor to flee, staring at the beggar who had dropped his head,\nwhich was enveloped in a rag, and no longer appeared to know that he\nwas there. At this strange moment, an instinct—possibly the mysterious\ninstinct of self-preservation,—restrained Jean Valjean from uttering a\nword. The beggar had the same figure, the same rags, the same\nappearance as he had every day. “Bah!” said Jean Valjean, “I am mad! I\nam dreaming! Impossible!” And he returned profoundly troubled.\n\nHe hardly dared to confess, even to himself, that the face which he\nthought he had seen was the face of Javert.\n\nThat night, on thinking the matter over, he regretted not having\nquestioned the man, in order to force him to raise his head a second\ntime.\n\nOn the following day, at nightfall, he went back. The beggar was at his\npost. “Good day, my good man,” said Jean Valjean, resolutely, handing\nhim a sou. The beggar raised his head, and replied in a whining voice,\n“Thanks, my good sir.” It was unmistakably the ex-beadle.\n\nJean Valjean felt completely reassured. He began to laugh. “How the\ndeuce could I have thought that I saw Javert there?” he thought. “Am I\ngoing to lose my eyesight now?” And he thought no more about it.\n\nA few days afterwards,—it might have been at eight o’clock in the\nevening,—he was in his room, and engaged in making Cosette spell aloud,\nwhen he heard the house door open and then shut again. This struck him\nas singular. The old woman, who was the only inhabitant of the house\nexcept himself, always went to bed at nightfall, so that she might not\nburn out her candles. Jean Valjean made a sign to Cosette to be quiet.\nHe heard some one ascending the stairs. It might possibly be the old\nwoman, who might have fallen ill and have been out to the apothecary’s.\nJean Valjean listened.\n\nThe step was heavy, and sounded like that of a man; but the old woman\nwore stout shoes, and there is nothing which so strongly resembles the\nstep of a man as that of an old woman. Nevertheless, Jean Valjean blew\nout his candle.\n\nHe had sent Cosette to bed, saying to her in a low voice, “Get into bed\nvery softly”; and as he kissed her brow, the steps paused.\n\nJean Valjean remained silent, motionless, with his back towards the\ndoor, seated on the chair from which he had not stirred, and holding\nhis breath in the dark.\n\nAfter the expiration of a rather long interval, he turned round, as he\nheard nothing more, and, as he raised his eyes towards the door of his\nchamber, he saw a light through the keyhole. This light formed a sort\nof sinister star in the blackness of the door and the wall. There was\nevidently some one there, who was holding a candle in his hand and\nlistening.\n\nSeveral minutes elapsed thus, and the light retreated. But he heard no\nsound of footsteps, which seemed to indicate that the person who had\nbeen listening at the door had removed his shoes.\n\nJean Valjean threw himself, all dressed as he was, on his bed, and\ncould not close his eyes all night.\n\nAt daybreak, just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue, he was\nawakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at the\nend of the corridor, then he heard the same masculine footstep which\nhad ascended the stairs on the preceding evening. The step was\napproaching. He sprang off the bed and applied his eye to the keyhole,\nwhich was tolerably large, hoping to see the person who had made his\nway by night into the house and had listened at his door, as he passed.\nIt was a man, in fact, who passed, this time without pausing, in front\nof Jean Valjean’s chamber. The corridor was too dark to allow of the\nperson’s face being distinguished; but when the man reached the\nstaircase, a ray of light from without made it stand out like a\nsilhouette, and Jean Valjean had a complete view of his back. The man\nwas of lofty stature, clad in a long frock-coat, with a cudgel under\nhis arm. The formidable neck and shoulders belonged to Javert.\n\nJean Valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse of him\nthrough his window opening on the boulevard, but he would have been\nobliged to open the window: he dared not.\n\nIt was evident that this man had entered with a key, and like himself.\nWho had given him that key? What was the meaning of this?\n\nWhen the old woman came to do the work, at seven o’clock in the\nmorning, Jean Valjean cast a penetrating glance on her, but he did not\nquestion her. The good woman appeared as usual.\n\nAs she swept up she remarked to him:—\n\n“Possibly Monsieur may have heard some one come in last night?”\n\n\nAt that age, and on that boulevard, eight o’clock in the evening was\nthe dead of the night.\n\n“That is true, by the way,” he replied, in the most natural tone\npossible. “Who was it?”\n\n\n“It was a new lodger who has come into the house,” said the old woman.\n\n“And what is his name?”\n\n\n“I don’t know exactly; Dumont, or Daumont, or some name of that sort.”\n\n\n“And who is this Monsieur Dumont?”\n\n\nThe old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes, and answered:—\n\n“A gentleman of property, like yourself.”\n\n\nPerhaps she had no ulterior meaning. Jean Valjean thought he perceived\none.\n\nWhen the old woman had taken her departure, he did up a hundred francs\nwhich he had in a cupboard, into a roll, and put it in his pocket. In\nspite of all the precautions which he took in this operation so that he\nmight not be heard rattling silver, a hundred-sou piece escaped from\nhis hands and rolled noisily on the floor.\n\nWhen darkness came on, he descended and carefully scrutinized both\nsides of the boulevard. He saw no one. The boulevard appeared to be\nabsolutely deserted. It is true that a person can conceal himself\nbehind trees.\n\nHe went upstairs again.\n\n“Come.” he said to Cosette.\n\nHe took her by the hand, and they both went out.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTH—FOR A BLACK HUNT, A MUTE PACK\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE ZIGZAGS OF STRATEGY\n\n\nAn observation here becomes necessary, in view of the pages which the\nreader is about to peruse, and of others which will be met with further\non.\n\nThe author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning\nhimself, has been absent from Paris for many years. Paris has been\ntransformed since he quitted it. A new city has arisen, which is, after\na fashion, unknown to him. There is no need for him to say that he\nloves Paris: Paris is his mind’s natal city. In consequence of\ndemolitions and reconstructions, the Paris of his youth, that Paris\nwhich he bore away religiously in his memory, is now a Paris of days\ngone by. He must be permitted to speak of that Paris as though it still\nexisted. It is possible that when the author conducts his readers to a\nspot and says, “In such a street there stands such and such a house,”\nneither street nor house will any longer exist in that locality.\nReaders may verify the facts if they care to take the trouble. For his\nown part, he is unacquainted with the new Paris, and he writes with the\nold Paris before his eyes in an illusion which is precious to him. It\nis a delight to him to dream that there still lingers behind him\nsomething of that which he beheld when he was in his own country, and\nthat all has not vanished. So long as you go and come in your native\nland, you imagine that those streets are a matter of indifference to\nyou; that those windows, those roofs, and those doors are nothing to\nyou; that those walls are strangers to you; that those trees are merely\nthe first encountered haphazard; that those houses, which you do not\nenter, are useless to you; that the pavements which you tread are\nmerely stones. Later on, when you are no longer there, you perceive\nthat the streets are dear to you; that you miss those roofs, those\ndoors; and that those walls are necessary to you, those trees are well\nbeloved by you; that you entered those houses which you never entered,\nevery day, and that you have left a part of your heart, of your blood,\nof your soul, in those pavements. All those places which you no longer\nbehold, which you may never behold again, perchance, and whose memory\nyou have cherished, take on a melancholy charm, recur to your mind with\nthe melancholy of an apparition, make the holy land visible to you, and\nare, so to speak, the very form of France, and you love them; and you\ncall them up as they are, as they were, and you persist in this, and\nyou will submit to no change: for you are attached to the figure of\nyour fatherland as to the face of your mother.\n\nMay we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present? That\nsaid, we beg the reader to take note of it, and we continue.\n\nJean Valjean instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into the\nstreets, taking the most intricate lines which he could devise,\nreturning on his track at times, to make sure that he was not being\nfollowed.\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nThe Black Hunt  2b5-1-black-hunt\n\n\nThis manœuvre is peculiar to the hunted stag. On soil where an imprint\nof the track may be left, this manœuvre possesses, among other\nadvantages, that of deceiving the huntsmen and the dogs, by throwing\nthem on the wrong scent. In venery this is called _false\nre-imbushment_.\n\nThe moon was full that night. Jean Valjean was not sorry for this. The\nmoon, still very close to the horizon, cast great masses of light and\nshadow in the streets. Jean Valjean could glide along close to the\nhouses on the dark side, and yet keep watch on the light side. He did\nnot, perhaps, take sufficiently into consideration the fact that the\ndark side escaped him. Still, in the deserted lanes which lie near the\nRue Poliveau, he thought he felt certain that no one was following him.\n\nCosette walked on without asking any questions. The sufferings of the\nfirst six years of her life had instilled something passive into her\nnature. Moreover,—and this is a remark to which we shall frequently\nhave occasion to recur,—she had grown used, without being herself aware\nof it, to the peculiarities of this good man and to the freaks of\ndestiny. And then she was with him, and she felt safe.\n\nJean Valjean knew no more where he was going than did Cosette. He\ntrusted in God, as she trusted in him. It seemed as though he also were\nclinging to the hand of some one greater than himself; he thought he\nfelt a being leading him, though invisible. However, he had no settled\nidea, no plan, no project. He was not even absolutely sure that it was\nJavert, and then it might have been Javert, without Javert knowing that\nhe was Jean Valjean. Was not he disguised? Was not he believed to be\ndead? Still, queer things had been going on for several days. He wanted\nno more of them. He was determined not to return to the Gorbeau house.\nLike the wild animal chased from its lair, he was seeking a hole in\nwhich he might hide until he could find one where he might dwell.\n\nJean Valjean described many and varied labyrinths in the Mouffetard\nquarter, which was already asleep, as though the discipline of the\nMiddle Ages and the yoke of the curfew still existed; he combined in\nvarious manners, with cunning strategy, the Rue Censier and the Rue\nCopeau, the Rue du Battoir-Saint-Victor and the Rue du Puits l’Ermite.\nThere are lodging houses in this locality, but he did not even enter\none, finding nothing which suited him. He had no doubt that if any one\nhad chanced to be upon his track, they would have lost it.\n\nAs eleven o’clock struck from Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, he was traversing\nthe Rue de Pontoise, in front of the office of the commissary of\npolice, situated at No. 14. A few moments later, the instinct of which\nwe have spoken above made him turn round. At that moment he saw\ndistinctly, thanks to the commissary’s lantern, which betrayed them,\nthree men who were following him closely, pass, one after the other,\nunder that lantern, on the dark side of the street. One of the three\nentered the alley leading to the commissary’s house. The one who\nmarched at their head struck him as decidedly suspicious.\n\n“Come, child,” he said to Cosette; and he made haste to quit the Rue\nPontoise.\n\nHe took a circuit, turned into the Passage des Patriarches, which was\nclosed on account of the hour, strode along the Rue de l‘Épée-de-Bois\nand the Rue de l’Arbalète, and plunged into the Rue des Postes.\n\nAt that time there was a square formed by the intersection of streets,\nwhere the College Rollin stands to-day, and where the Rue\nNeuve-Sainte-Geneviève turns off.\n\nIt is understood, of course, that the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève is an\nold street, and that a posting-chaise does not pass through the Rue des\nPostes once in ten years. In the thirteenth century this Rue des Postes\nwas inhabited by potters, and its real name is Rue des Pots.\n\nThe moon cast a livid light into this open space. Jean Valjean went\ninto ambush in a doorway, calculating that if the men were still\nfollowing him, he could not fail to get a good look at them, as they\ntraversed this illuminated space.\n\nIn point of fact, three minutes had not elapsed when the men made their\nappearance. There were four of them now. All were tall, dressed in\nlong, brown coats, with round hats, and huge cudgels in their hands.\nTheir great stature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarming\nthan did their sinister stride through the darkness. One would have\npronounced them four spectres disguised as bourgeois.\n\nThey halted in the middle of the space and formed a group, like men in\nconsultation. They had an air of indecision. The one who appeared to be\ntheir leader turned round and pointed hastily with his right hand in\nthe direction which Jean Valjean had taken; another seemed to indicate\nthe contrary direction with considerable obstinacy. At the moment when\nthe first man wheeled round, the moon fell full in his face. Jean\nValjean recognized Javert perfectly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—IT IS LUCKY THAT THE PONT D’AUSTERLITZ BEARS CARRIAGES\n\n\nUncertainty was at an end for Jean Valjean: fortunately it still lasted\nfor the men. He took advantage of their hesitation. It was time lost\nfor them, but gained for him. He slipped from under the gate where he\nhad concealed himself, and went down the Rue des Postes, towards the\nregion of the Jardin des Plantes. Cosette was beginning to be tired. He\ntook her in his arms and carried her. There were no passers-by, and the\nstreet lanterns had not been lighted on account of there being a moon.\n\nHe redoubled his pace.\n\nIn a few strides he had reached the Goblet potteries, on the front of\nwhich the moonlight rendered distinctly legible the ancient\ninscription:—\n\nDe Goblet fils c’est ici la fabrique;\nVenez choisir des cruches et des brocs,\nDes pots à fleurs, des tuyaux, de la brique.\nA tout venant le Cœur vend des Carreaux.14\n\n\nHe left behind him the Rue de la Clef, then the Fountain Saint-Victor,\nskirted the Jardin des Plantes by the lower streets, and reached the\nquay. There he turned round. The quay was deserted. The streets were\ndeserted. There was no one behind him. He drew a long breath.\n\nHe gained the Pont d’Austerlitz.\n\nTolls were still collected there at that epoch.\n\nHe presented himself at the toll office and handed over a sou.\n\n“It is two sous,” said the old soldier in charge of the bridge. “You\nare carrying a child who can walk. Pay for two.”\n\n\nHe paid, vexed that his passage should have aroused remark. Every\nflight should be an imperceptible slipping away.\n\nA heavy cart was crossing the Seine at the same time as himself, and on\nits way, like him, to the right bank. This was of use to him. He could\ntraverse the bridge in the shadow of the cart.\n\nTowards the middle of the Bridge, Cosette, whose feet were benumbed,\nwanted to walk. He set her on the ground and took her hand again.\n\nThe bridge once crossed, he perceived some timber-yards on his right.\nHe directed his course thither. In order to reach them, it was\nnecessary to risk himself in a tolerably large unsheltered and\nilluminated space. He did not hesitate. Those who were on his track had\nevidently lost the scent, and Jean Valjean believed himself to be out\nof danger. Hunted, yes; followed, no.\n\nA little street, the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, opened out\nbetween two timber-yards enclosed in walls. This street was dark and\nnarrow and seemed made expressly for him. Before entering it he cast a\nglance behind him.\n\nFrom the point where he stood he could see the whole extent of the Pont\nd’Austerlitz.\n\nFour shadows were just entering on the bridge.\n\nThese shadows had their backs turned to the Jardin des Plantes and were\non their way to the right bank.\n\nThese four shadows were the four men.\n\nJean Valjean shuddered like the wild beast which is recaptured.\n\nOne hope remained to him; it was, that the men had not, perhaps,\nstepped on the bridge, and had not caught sight of him while he was\ncrossing the large illuminated space, holding Cosette by the hand.\n\nIn that case, by plunging into the little street before him, he might\nescape, if he could reach the timber-yards, the marshes, the\nmarket-gardens, the uninhabited ground which was not built upon.\n\nIt seemed to him that he might commit himself to that silent little\nstreet. He entered it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—TO WIT, THE PLAN OF PARIS IN 1727\n\n\nThree hundred paces further on, he arrived at a point where the street\nforked. It separated into two streets, which ran in a slanting line,\none to the right, and the other to the left.\n\nJean Valjean had before him what resembled the two branches of a Y.\nWhich should he choose? He did not hesitate, but took the one on the\nright.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause that to the left ran towards a suburb, that is to say, towards\ninhabited regions, and the right branch towards the open country, that\nis to say, towards deserted regions.\n\nHowever, they no longer walked very fast. Cosette’s pace retarded Jean\nValjean’s.\n\nHe took her up and carried her again. Cosette laid her head on the\nshoulder of the good man and said not a word.\n\nHe turned round from time to time and looked behind him. He took care\nto keep always on the dark side of the street. The street was straight\nin his rear. The first two or three times that he turned round he saw\nnothing; the silence was profound, and he continued his march somewhat\nreassured. All at once, on turning round, he thought he perceived in\nthe portion of the street which he had just passed through, far off in\nthe obscurity, something which was moving.\n\nHe rushed forward precipitately rather than walked, hoping to find some\nside-street, to make his escape through it, and thus to break his scent\nonce more.\n\nHe arrived at a wall.\n\nThis wall, however, did not absolutely prevent further progress; it was\na wall which bordered a transverse street, in which the one he had\ntaken ended.\n\nHere again, he was obliged to come to a decision; should he go to the\nright or to the left.\n\nHe glanced to the right. The fragmentary lane was prolonged between\nbuildings which were either sheds or barns, then ended at a blind\nalley. The extremity of the cul-de-sac was distinctly visible,—a lofty\nwhite wall.\n\nHe glanced to the left. On that side the lane was open, and about two\nhundred paces further on, ran into a street of which it was the\naffluent. On that side lay safety.\n\nAt the moment when Jean Valjean was meditating a turn to the left, in\nan effort to reach the street which he saw at the end of the lane, he\nperceived a sort of motionless, black statue at the corner of the lane\nand the street towards which he was on the point of directing his\nsteps.\n\nIt was some one, a man, who had evidently just been posted there, and\nwho was barring the passage and waiting.\n\nJean Valjean recoiled.\n\nThe point of Paris where Jean Valjean found himself, situated between\nthe Faubourg Saint-Antoine and la Râpée, is one of those which recent\nimprovements have transformed from top to bottom,—resulting in\ndisfigurement according to some, and in a transfiguration according to\nothers. The market-gardens, the timber-yards, and the old buildings\nhave been effaced. To-day, there are brand-new, wide streets, arenas,\ncircuses, hippodromes, railway stations, and a prison, Mazas, there;\nprogress, as the reader sees, with its antidote.\n\nHalf a century ago, in that ordinary, popular tongue, which is all\ncompounded of traditions, which persists in calling the Institut _les\nQuatre-Nations_, and the Opera-Comique _Feydeau_, the precise spot\nwhither Jean Valjean had arrived was called _le Petit-Picpus_. The\nPorte Saint-Jacques, the Porte Paris, the Barrière des Sergents, the\nPorcherons, la Galiote, les Célestins, les Capucins, le Mail, la\nBourbe, l’Arbre de Cracovie, la Petite-Pologne—these are the names of\nold Paris which survive amid the new. The memory of the populace hovers\nover these relics of the past.\n\nLe Petit-Picpus, which, moreover, hardly ever had any existence, and\nnever was more than the outline of a quarter, had nearly the monkish\naspect of a Spanish town. The roads were not much paved; the streets\nwere not much built up. With the exception of the two or three streets,\nof which we shall presently speak, all was wall and solitude there. Not\na shop, not a vehicle, hardly a candle lighted here and there in the\nwindows; all lights extinguished after ten o’clock. Gardens, convents,\ntimber-yards, marshes; occasional lowly dwellings and great walls as\nhigh as the houses.\n\nSuch was this quarter in the last century. The Revolution snubbed it\nsoundly. The republican government demolished and cut through it.\nRubbish shoots were established there. Thirty years ago, this quarter\nwas disappearing under the erasing process of new buildings. To-day, it\nhas been utterly blotted out. The Petit-Picpus, of which no existing\nplan has preserved a trace, is indicated with sufficient clearness in\nthe plan of 1727, published at Paris by Denis Thierry, Rue\nSaint-Jacques, opposite the Rue du Plâtre; and at Lyons, by Jean Girin,\nRue Mercière, at the sign of Prudence. Petit-Picpus had, as we have\njust mentioned, a Y of streets, formed by the Rue du\nChemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, which spread out in two branches, taking on\nthe left the name of Little Picpus Street, and on the right the name of\nthe Rue Polonceau. The two limbs of the Y were connected at the apex as\nby a bar; this bar was called Rue Droit-Mur. The Rue Polonceau ended\nthere; Rue Petit-Picpus passed on, and ascended towards the Lenoir\nmarket. A person coming from the Seine reached the extremity of the Rue\nPolonceau, and had on his right the Rue Droit-Mur, turning abruptly at\na right angle, in front of him the wall of that street, and on his\nright a truncated prolongation of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had no issue\nand was called the Cul-de-Sac Genrot.\n\nIt was here that Jean Valjean stood.\n\nAs we have just said, on catching sight of that black silhouette\nstanding on guard at the angle of the Rue Droit-Mur and the Rue\nPetit-Picpus, he recoiled. There could be no doubt of it. That phantom\nwas lying in wait for him.\n\nWhat was he to do?\n\nThe time for retreating was passed. That which he had perceived in\nmovement an instant before, in the distant darkness, was Javert and his\nsquad without a doubt. Javert was probably already at the commencement\nof the street at whose end Jean Valjean stood. Javert, to all\nappearances, was acquainted with this little labyrinth, and had taken\nhis precautions by sending one of his men to guard the exit. These\nsurmises, which so closely resembled proofs, whirled suddenly, like a\nhandful of dust caught up by an unexpected gust of wind, through Jean\nValjean’s mournful brain. He examined the Cul-de-Sac Genrot; there he\nwas cut off. He examined the Rue Petit-Picpus; there stood a sentinel.\nHe saw that black form standing out in relief against the white\npavement, illuminated by the moon; to advance was to fall into this\nman’s hands; to retreat was to fling himself into Javert’s arms. Jean\nValjean felt himself caught, as in a net, which was slowly contracting;\nhe gazed heavenward in despair.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—THE GROPINGS OF FLIGHT\n\n\nIn order to understand what follows, it is requisite to form an exact\nidea of the Droit-Mur lane, and, in particular, of the angle which one\nleaves on the left when one emerges from the Rue Polonceau into this\nlane. Droit-Mur lane was almost entirely bordered on the right, as far\nas the Rue Petit-Picpus, by houses of mean aspect; on the left by a\nsolitary building of severe outlines, composed of numerous parts which\ngrew gradually higher by a story or two as they approached the Rue\nPetit-Picpus side; so that this building, which was very lofty on the\nRue Petit-Picpus side, was tolerably low on the side adjoining the Rue\nPolonceau. There, at the angle of which we have spoken, it descended to\nsuch a degree that it consisted of merely a wall. This wall did not\nabut directly on the street; it formed a deeply retreating niche,\nconcealed by its two corners from two observers who might have been,\none in the Rue Polonceau, the other in the Rue Droit-Mur.\n\nBeginning with these angles of the niche, the wall extended along the\nRue Polonceau as far as a house which bore the number 49, and along the\nRue Droit-Mur, where the fragment was much shorter, as far as the\ngloomy building which we have mentioned and whose gable it intersected,\nthus forming another retreating angle in the street. This gable was\nsombre of aspect; only one window was visible, or, to speak more\ncorrectly, two shutters covered with a sheet of zinc and kept\nconstantly closed.\n\nThe state of the places of which we are here giving a description is\nrigorously exact, and will certainly awaken a very precise memory in\nthe mind of old inhabitants of the quarter.\n\nThe niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a colossal and\nwretched door; it was a vast, formless assemblage of perpendicular\nplanks, the upper ones being broader than the lower, bound together by\nlong transverse strips of iron. At one side there was a carriage gate\nof the ordinary dimensions, and which had evidently not been cut more\nthan fifty years previously.\n\nA linden-tree showed its crest above the niche, and the wall was\ncovered with ivy on the side of the Rue Polonceau.\n\nIn the imminent peril in which Jean Valjean found himself, this sombre\nbuilding had about it a solitary and uninhabited look which tempted\nhim. He ran his eyes rapidly over it; he said to himself, that if he\ncould contrive to get inside it, he might save himself. First he\nconceived an idea, then a hope.\n\nIn the central portion of the front of this building, on the Rue\nDroit-Mur side, there were at all the windows of the different stories\nancient cistern pipes of lead. The various branches of the pipes which\nled from one central pipe to all these little basins sketched out a\nsort of tree on the front. These ramifications of pipes with their\nhundred elbows imitated those old leafless vine-stocks which writhe\nover the fronts of old farm-houses.\n\nThis odd espalier, with its branches of lead and iron, was the first\nthing that struck Jean Valjean. He seated Cosette with her back against\na stone post, with an injunction to be silent, and ran to the spot\nwhere the conduit touched the pavement. Perhaps there was some way of\nclimbing up by it and entering the house. But the pipe was dilapidated\nand past service, and hardly hung to its fastenings. Moreover, all the\nwindows of this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars, even\nthe attic windows in the roof. And then, the moon fell full upon that\nfaçade, and the man who was watching at the corner of the street would\nhave seen Jean Valjean in the act of climbing. And finally, what was to\nbe done with Cosette? How was she to be drawn up to the top of a\nthree-story house?\n\nHe gave up all idea of climbing by means of the drain-pipe, and crawled\nalong the wall to get back into the Rue Polonceau.\n\nWhen he reached the slant of the wall where he had left Cosette, he\nnoticed that no one could see him there. As we have just explained, he\nwas concealed from all eyes, no matter from which direction they were\napproaching; besides this, he was in the shadow. Finally, there were\ntwo doors; perhaps they might be forced. The wall above which he saw\nthe linden-tree and the ivy evidently abutted on a garden where he\ncould, at least, hide himself, although there were as yet no leaves on\nthe trees, and spend the remainder of the night.\n\nTime was passing; he must act quickly.\n\nHe felt over the carriage door, and immediately recognized the fact\nthat it was impracticable outside and in.\n\nHe approached the other door with more hope; it was frightfully\ndecrepit; its very immensity rendered it less solid; the planks were\nrotten; the iron bands—there were only three of them—were rusted. It\nseemed as though it might be possible to pierce this worm-eaten\nbarrier.\n\nOn examining it he found that the door was not a door; it had neither\nhinges, cross-bars, lock, nor fissure in the middle; the iron bands\ntraversed it from side to side without any break. Through the crevices\nin the planks he caught a view of unhewn slabs and blocks of stone\nroughly cemented together, which passers-by might still have seen there\nten years ago. He was forced to acknowledge with consternation that\nthis apparent door was simply the wooden decoration of a building\nagainst which it was placed. It was easy to tear off a plank; but then,\none found one’s self face to face with a wall.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH GAS LANTERNS\n\n\nAt that moment a heavy and measured sound began to be audible at some\ndistance. Jean Valjean risked a glance round the corner of the street.\nSeven or eight soldiers, drawn up in a platoon, had just debouched into\nthe Rue Polonceau. He saw the gleam of their bayonets. They were\nadvancing towards him; these soldiers, at whose head he distinguished\nJavert’s tall figure, advanced slowly and cautiously. They halted\nfrequently; it was plain that they were searching all the nooks of the\nwalls and all the embrasures of the doors and alleys.\n\nThis was some patrol that Javert had encountered—there could be no\nmistake as to this surmise—and whose aid he had demanded.\n\nJavert’s two acolytes were marching in their ranks.\n\nAt the rate at which they were marching, and in consideration of the\nhalts which they were making, it would take them about a quarter of an\nhour to reach the spot where Jean Valjean stood. It was a frightful\nmoment. A few minutes only separated Jean Valjean from that terrible\nprecipice which yawned before him for the third time. And the galleys\nnow meant not only the galleys, but Cosette lost to him forever; that\nis to say, a life resembling the interior of a tomb.\n\nThere was but one thing which was possible.\n\nJean Valjean had this peculiarity, that he carried, as one might say,\ntwo beggar’s pouches: in one he kept his saintly thoughts; in the other\nthe redoubtable talents of a convict. He rummaged in the one or the\nother, according to circumstances.\n\nAmong his other resources, thanks to his numerous escapes from the\nprison at Toulon, he was, as it will be remembered, a past master in\nthe incredible art of crawling up without ladder or climbing-irons, by\nsheer muscular force, by leaning on the nape of his neck, his\nshoulders, his hips, and his knees, by helping himself on the rare\nprojections of the stone, in the right angle of a wall, as high as the\nsixth story, if need be; an art which has rendered so celebrated and so\nalarming that corner of the wall of the Conciergerie of Paris by which\nBattemolle, condemned to death, made his escape twenty years ago.\n\nJean Valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied the\nlinden; it was about eighteen feet in height. The angle which it formed\nwith the gable of the large building was filled, at its lower\nextremity, by a mass of masonry of a triangular shape, probably\nintended to preserve that too convenient corner from the rubbish of\nthose dirty creatures called the passers-by. This practice of filling\nup corners of the wall is much in use in Paris.\n\nThis mass was about five feet in height; the space above the summit of\nthis mass which it was necessary to climb was not more than fourteen\nfeet.\n\nThe wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping.\n\nCosette was the difficulty, for she did not know how to climb a wall.\nShould he abandon her? Jean Valjean did not once think of that. It was\nimpossible to carry her. A man’s whole strength is required to\nsuccessfully carry out these singular ascents. The least burden would\ndisturb his centre of gravity and pull him downwards.\n\nA rope would have been required; Jean Valjean had none. Where was he to\nget a rope at midnight, in the Rue Polonceau? Certainly, if Jean\nValjean had had a kingdom, he would have given it for a rope at that\nmoment.\n\nAll extreme situations have their lightning flashes which sometimes\ndazzle, sometimes illuminate us.\n\nJean Valjean’s despairing glance fell on the street lantern-post of the\nblind alley Genrot.\n\nAt that epoch there were no gas-jets in the streets of Paris. At\nnightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted; they were\nascended and descended by means of a rope, which traversed the street\nfrom side to side, and was adjusted in a groove of the post. The pulley\nover which this rope ran was fastened underneath the lantern in a\nlittle iron box, the key to which was kept by the lamp-lighter, and the\nrope itself was protected by a metal case.\n\nJean Valjean, with the energy of a supreme struggle, crossed the street\nat one bound, entered the blind alley, broke the latch of the little\nbox with the point of his knife, and an instant later he was beside\nCosette once more. He had a rope. These gloomy inventors of expedients\nwork rapidly when they are fighting against fatality.\n\nWe have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted that\nnight. The lantern in the Cul-de-Sac Genrot was thus naturally extinct,\nlike the rest; and one could pass directly under it without even\nnoticing that it was no longer in its place.\n\nNevertheless, the hour, the place, the darkness, Jean Valjean’s\nabsorption, his singular gestures, his goings and comings, all had\nbegun to render Cosette uneasy. Any other child than she would have\ngiven vent to loud shrieks long before. She contented herself with\nplucking Jean Valjean by the skirt of his coat. They could hear the\nsound of the patrol’s approach ever more and more distinctly.\n\n“Father,” said she, in a very low voice, “I am afraid. Who is coming\nyonder?”\n\n\n“Hush!” replied the unhappy man; “it is Madame Thénardier.”\n\n\nCosette shuddered. He added:—\n\n“Say nothing. Don’t interfere with me. If you cry out, if you weep, the\nThénardier is lying in wait for you. She is coming to take you back.”\n\n\nThen, without haste, but without making a useless movement, with firm\nand curt precision, the more remarkable at a moment when the patrol and\nJavert might come upon him at any moment, he undid his cravat, passed\nit round Cosette’s body under the armpits, taking care that it should\nnot hurt the child, fastened this cravat to one end of the rope, by\nmeans of that knot which seafaring men call a “swallow knot,” took the\nother end of the rope in his teeth, pulled off his shoes and stockings,\nwhich he threw over the wall, stepped upon the mass of masonry, and\nbegan to raise himself in the angle of the wall and the gable with as\nmuch solidity and certainty as though he had the rounds of a ladder\nunder his feet and elbows. Half a minute had not elapsed when he was\nresting on his knees on the wall.\n\nCosette gazed at him in stupid amazement, without uttering a word. Jean\nValjean’s injunction, and the name of Madame Thénardier, had chilled\nher blood.\n\nAll at once she heard Jean Valjean’s voice crying to her, though in a\nvery low tone:—\n\n“Put your back against the wall.”\n\n\nShe obeyed.\n\n“Don’t say a word, and don’t be alarmed,” went on Jean Valjean.\n\nAnd she felt herself lifted from the ground.\n\nBefore she had time to recover herself, she was on the top of the wall.\n\nJean Valjean grasped her, put her on his back, took her two tiny hands\nin his large left hand, lay down flat on his stomach and crawled along\non top of the wall as far as the cant. As he had guessed, there stood a\nbuilding whose roof started from the top of the wooden barricade and\ndescended to within a very short distance of the ground, with a gentle\nslope which grazed the linden-tree. A lucky circumstance, for the wall\nwas much higher on this side than on the street side. Jean Valjean\ncould only see the ground at a great depth below him.\n\nHe had just reached the slope of the roof, and had not yet left the\ncrest of the wall, when a violent uproar announced the arrival of the\npatrol. The thundering voice of Javert was audible:—\n\n“Search the blind alley! The Rue Droit-Mur is guarded! so is the Rue\nPetit-Picpus. I’ll answer for it that he is in the blind alley.”\n\n\nThe soldiers rushed into the Genrot alley.\n\nJean Valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof, still holding fast\nto Cosette, reached the linden-tree, and leaped to the ground. Whether\nfrom terror or courage, Cosette had not breathed a sound, though her\nhands were a little abraded.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—THE BEGINNING OF AN ENIGMA\n\n\nJean Valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was very vast and\nof singular aspect; one of those melancholy gardens which seem made to\nbe looked at in winter and at night. This garden was oblong in shape,\nwith an alley of large poplars at the further end, tolerably tall\nforest trees in the corners, and an unshaded space in the centre, where\ncould be seen a very large, solitary tree, then several fruit-trees,\ngnarled and bristling like bushes, beds of vegetables, a melon patch,\nwhose glass frames sparkled in the moonlight, and an old well. Here and\nthere stood stone benches which seemed black with moss. The alleys were\nbordered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs. The grass had half\ntaken possession of them, and a green mould covered the rest.\n\nJean Valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as a\nmeans of descent, a pile of fagots, and, behind the fagots, directly\nagainst the wall, a stone statue, whose mutilated face was no longer\nanything more than a shapeless mask which loomed vaguely through the\ngloom.\n\nThe building was a sort of ruin, where dismantled chambers were\ndistinguishable, one of which, much encumbered, seemed to serve as a\nshed.\n\nThe large building of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had a wing on the Rue\nPetit-Picpus, turned two façades, at right angles, towards this garden.\nThese interior façades were even more tragic than the exterior. All the\nwindows were grated. Not a gleam of light was visible at any one of\nthem. The upper story had scuttles like prisons. One of those façades\ncast its shadow on the other, which fell over the garden like an\nimmense black pall.\n\nNo other house was visible. The bottom of the garden was lost in mist\nand darkness. Nevertheless, walls could be confusedly made out, which\nintersected as though there were more cultivated land beyond, and the\nlow roofs of the Rue Polonceau.\n\nNothing more wild and solitary than this garden could be imagined.\nThere was no one in it, which was quite natural in view of the hour;\nbut it did not seem as though this spot were made for any one to walk\nin, even in broad daylight.\n\nJean Valjean’s first care had been to get hold of his shoes and put\nthem on again, then to step under the shed with Cosette. A man who is\nfleeing never thinks himself sufficiently hidden. The child, whose\nthoughts were still on the Thénardier, shared his instinct for\nwithdrawing from sight as much as possible.\n\nCosette trembled and pressed close to him. They heard the tumultuous\nnoise of the patrol searching the blind alley and the streets; the\nblows of their gun-stocks against the stones; Javert’s appeals to the\npolice spies whom he had posted, and his imprecations mingled with\nwords which could not be distinguished.\n\nAt the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though that\nspecies of stormy roar were becoming more distant. Jean Valjean held\nhis breath.\n\nHe had laid his hand lightly on Cosette’s mouth.\n\nHowever, the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm, that\nthis frightful uproar, close and furious as it was, did not disturb him\nby so much as the shadow of a misgiving. It seemed as though those\nwalls had been built of the deaf stones of which the Scriptures speak.\n\nAll at once, in the midst of this profound calm, a fresh sound arose; a\nsound as celestial, divine, ineffable, ravishing, as the other had been\nhorrible. It was a hymn which issued from the gloom, a dazzling burst\nof prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night;\nwomen’s voices, but voices composed at one and the same time of the\npure accents of virgins and the innocent accents of children,—voices\nwhich are not of the earth, and which resemble those that the newborn\ninfant still hears, and which the dying man hears already. This song\nproceeded from the gloomy edifice which towered above the garden. At\nthe moment when the hubbub of demons retreated, one would have said\nthat a choir of angels was approaching through the gloom.\n\nCosette and Jean Valjean fell on their knees.\n\nThey knew not what it was, they knew not where they were; but both of\nthem, the man and the child, the penitent and the innocent, felt that\nthey must kneel.\n\nThese voices had this strange characteristic, that they did not prevent\nthe building from seeming to be deserted. It was a supernatural chant\nin an uninhabited house.\n\nWhile these voices were singing, Jean Valjean thought of nothing. He no\nlonger beheld the night; he beheld a blue sky. It seemed to him that he\nfelt those wings which we all have within us, unfolding.\n\nThe song died away. It may have lasted a long time. Jean Valjean could\nnot have told. Hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment.\n\nAll fell silent again. There was no longer anything in the street;\nthere was nothing in the garden. That which had menaced, that which had\nreassured him,—all had vanished. The breeze swayed a few dry weeds on\nthe crest of the wall, and they gave out a faint, sweet, melancholy\nsound.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—CONTINUATION OF THE ENIGMA\n\n\nThe night wind had risen, which indicated that it must be between one\nand two o’clock in the morning. Poor Cosette said nothing. As she had\nseated herself beside him and leaned her head against him, Jean Valjean\nhad fancied that she was asleep. He bent down and looked at her.\nCosette’s eyes were wide open, and her thoughtful air pained Jean\nValjean.\n\nShe was still trembling.\n\n“Are you sleepy?” said Jean Valjean.\n\n“I am very cold,” she replied.\n\nA moment later she resumed:—\n\n“Is she still there?”\n\n\n“Who?” said Jean Valjean.\n\n“Madame Thénardier.”\n\n\nJean Valjean had already forgotten the means which he had employed to\nmake Cosette keep silent.\n\n“Ah!” said he, “she is gone. You need fear nothing further.”\n\n\nThe child sighed as though a load had been lifted from her breast.\n\nThe ground was damp, the shed open on all sides, the breeze grew more\nkeen every instant. The goodman took off his coat and wrapped it round\nCosette.\n\n“Are you less cold now?” said he.\n\n“Oh, yes, father.”\n\n\n“Well, wait for me a moment. I will soon be back.”\n\n\nHe quitted the ruin and crept along the large building, seeking a\nbetter shelter. He came across doors, but they were closed. There were\nbars at all the windows of the ground floor.\n\nJust after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice, he observed\nthat he was coming to some arched windows, where he perceived a light.\nHe stood on tiptoe and peeped through one of these windows. They all\nopened on a tolerably vast hall, paved with large flagstones, cut up by\narcades and pillars, where only a tiny light and great shadows were\nvisible. The light came from a taper which was burning in one corner.\nThe apartment was deserted, and nothing was stirring in it.\nNevertheless, by dint of gazing intently he thought he perceived on the\nground something which appeared to be covered with a winding-sheet, and\nwhich resembled a human form. This form was lying face downward, flat\non the pavement, with the arms extended in the form of a cross, in the\nimmobility of death. One would have said, judging from a sort of\nserpent which undulated over the floor, that this sinister form had a\nrope round its neck.\n\nThe whole chamber was bathed in that mist of places which are sparely\nilluminated, which adds to horror.\n\nJean Valjean often said afterwards, that, although many funereal\nspectres had crossed his path in life, he had never beheld anything\nmore blood-curdling and terrible than that enigmatical form\naccomplishing some inexplicable mystery in that gloomy place, and\nbeheld thus at night. It was alarming to suppose that that thing was\nperhaps dead; and still more alarming to think that it was perhaps\nalive.\n\nHe had the courage to plaster his face to the glass, and to watch\nwhether the thing would move. In spite of his remaining thus what\nseemed to him a very long time, the outstretched form made no movement.\nAll at once he felt himself overpowered by an inexpressible terror, and\nhe fled. He began to run towards the shed, not daring to look behind\nhim. It seemed to him, that if he turned his head, he should see that\nform following him with great strides and waving its arms.\n\nHe reached the ruin all out of breath. His knees were giving way\nbeneath him; the perspiration was pouring from him.\n\nWhere was he? Who could ever have imagined anything like that sort of\nsepulchre in the midst of Paris! What was this strange house? An\nedifice full of nocturnal mystery, calling to souls through the\ndarkness with the voice of angels, and when they came, offering them\nabruptly that terrible vision; promising to open the radiant portals of\nheaven, and then opening the horrible gates of the tomb! And it\nactually was an edifice, a house, which bore a number on the street! It\nwas not a dream! He had to touch the stones to convince himself that\nsuch was the fact.\n\nCold, anxiety, uneasiness, the emotions of the night, had given him a\ngenuine fever, and all these ideas were clashing together in his brain.\n\nHe stepped up to Cosette. She was asleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—THE ENIGMA BECOMES DOUBLY MYSTERIOUS\n\n\nThe child had laid her head on a stone and fallen asleep.\n\nHe sat down beside her and began to think. Little by little, as he\ngazed at her, he grew calm and regained possession of his freedom of\nmind.\n\nHe clearly perceived this truth, the foundation of his life henceforth,\nthat so long as she was there, so long as he had her near him, he\nshould need nothing except for her, he should fear nothing except for\nher. He was not even conscious that he was very cold, since he had\ntaken off his coat to cover her.\n\nNevertheless, athwart this reverie into which he had fallen he had\nheard for some time a peculiar noise. It was like the tinkling of a\nbell. This sound proceeded from the garden. It could be heard\ndistinctly though faintly. It resembled the faint, vague music produced\nby the bells of cattle at night in the pastures.\n\nThis noise made Valjean turn round.\n\nHe looked and saw that there was some one in the garden.\n\nA being resembling a man was walking amid the bell-glasses of the melon\nbeds, rising, stooping, halting, with regular movements, as though he\nwere dragging or spreading out something on the ground. This person\nappeared to limp.\n\nJean Valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy. For\nthem everything is hostile and suspicious. They distrust the day\nbecause it enables people to see them, and the night because it aids in\nsurprising them. A little while before he had shivered because the\ngarden was deserted, and now he shivered because there was some one\nthere.\n\nHe fell back from chimerical terrors to real terrors. He said to\nhimself that Javert and the spies had, perhaps, not taken their\ndeparture; that they had, no doubt, left people on the watch in the\nstreet; that if this man should discover him in the garden, he would\ncry out for help against thieves and deliver him up. He took the\nsleeping Cosette gently in his arms and carried her behind a heap of\nold furniture, which was out of use, in the most remote corner of the\nshed. Cosette did not stir.\n\nFrom that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the melon\npatch. The strange thing about it was, that the sound of the bell\nfollowed each of this man’s movements. When the man approached, the\nsound approached; when the man retreated, the sound retreated; if he\nmade any hasty gesture, a tremolo accompanied the gesture; when he\nhalted, the sound ceased. It appeared evident that the bell was\nattached to that man; but what could that signify? Who was this man who\nhad a bell suspended about him like a ram or an ox?\n\nAs he put these questions to himself, he touched Cosette’s hands. They\nwere icy cold.\n\n“Ah! good God!” he cried.\n\nHe spoke to her in a low voice:—\n\n“Cosette!”\n\n\nShe did not open her eyes.\n\nHe shook her vigorously.\n\nShe did not wake.\n\n“Is she dead?” he said to himself, and sprang to his feet, quivering\nfrom head to foot.\n\nThe most frightful thoughts rushed pell-mell through his mind. There\nare moments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort of furies,\nand violently force the partitions of our brains. When those we love\nare in question, our prudence invents every sort of madness. He\nremembered that sleep in the open air on a cold night may be fatal.\n\nCosette was pale, and had fallen at full length on the ground at his\nfeet, without a movement.\n\nHe listened to her breathing: she still breathed, but with a\nrespiration which seemed to him weak and on the point of extinction.\n\nHow was he to warm her back to life? How was he to rouse her? All that\nwas not connected with this vanished from his thoughts. He rushed\nwildly from the ruin.\n\nIt was absolutely necessary that Cosette should be in bed and beside a\nfire in less than a quarter of an hour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—THE MAN WITH THE BELL\n\n\nHe walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden. He had\ntaken in his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of his\nwaistcoat.\n\nThe man’s head was bent down, and he did not see him approaching. In a\nfew strides Jean Valjean stood beside him.\n\nJean Valjean accosted him with the cry:—\n\n“One hundred francs!”\n\n\nThe man gave a start and raised his eyes.\n\n“You can earn a hundred francs,” went on Jean Valjean, “if you will\ngrant me shelter for this night.”\n\n\nThe moon shone full upon Jean Valjean’s terrified countenance.\n\n“What! so it is you, Father Madeleine!” said the man.\n\nThat name, thus pronounced, at that obscure hour, in that unknown spot,\nby that strange man, made Jean Valjean start back.\n\nHe had expected anything but that. The person who thus addressed him\nwas a bent and lame old man, dressed almost like a peasant, who wore on\nhis left knee a leather knee-cap, whence hung a moderately large bell.\nHis face, which was in the shadow, was not distinguishable.\n\nHowever, the goodman had removed his cap, and exclaimed, trembling all\nover:—\n\n“Ah, good God! How come you here, Father Madeleine? Where did you\nenter? Dieu-Jésus! Did you fall from heaven? There is no trouble about\nthat: if ever you do fall, it will be from there. And what a state you\nare in! You have no cravat; you have no hat; you have no coat! Do you\nknow, you would have frightened any one who did not know you? No coat!\nLord God! Are the saints going mad nowadays? But how did you get in\nhere?”\n\n\nHis words tumbled over each other. The goodman talked with a rustic\nvolubility, in which there was nothing alarming. All this was uttered\nwith a mixture of stupefaction and _naïve_ kindliness.\n\n“Who are you? and what house is this?” demanded Jean Valjean.\n\n“Ah! pardieu, this is too much!” exclaimed the old man. “I am the\nperson for whom you got the place here, and this house is the one where\nyou had me placed. What! You don’t recognize me?”\n\n\n“No,” said Jean Valjean; “and how happens it that you know me?”\n\n\n“You saved my life,” said the man.\n\nHe turned. A ray of moonlight outlined his profile, and Jean Valjean\nrecognized old Fauchelevent.\n\n“Ah!” said Jean Valjean, “so it is you? Yes, I recollect you.”\n\n\n“That is very lucky,” said the old man, in a reproachful tone.\n\n“And what are you doing here?” resumed Jean Valjean.\n\n“Why, I am covering my melons, of course!”\n\n\nIn fact, at the moment when Jean Valjean accosted him, old Fauchelevent\nheld in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied in\nspreading over the melon bed. During the hour or thereabouts that he\nhad been in the garden he had already spread out a number of them. It\nwas this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar\nmovements observed from the shed by Jean Valjean.\n\nHe continued:—\n\n“I said to myself, ‘The moon is bright: it is going to freeze. What if\nI were to put my melons into their greatcoats?’ And,” he added, looking\nat Jean Valjean with a broad smile,—“pardieu! you ought to have done\nthe same! But how do you come here?”\n\n\nJean Valjean, finding himself known to this man, at least only under\nthe name of Madeleine, thenceforth advanced only with caution. He\nmultiplied his questions. Strange to say, their rôles seemed to be\nreversed. It was he, the intruder, who interrogated.\n\n“And what is this bell which you wear on your knee?”\n\n\n“This,” replied Fauchelevent, “is so that I may be avoided.”\n\n\n“What! so that you may be avoided?”\n\n\nOld Fauchelevent winked with an indescribable air.\n\n“Ah, goodness! there are only women in this house—many young girls. It\nappears that I should be a dangerous person to meet. The bell gives\nthem warning. When I come, they go.”\n\n\n“What house is this?”\n\n\n“Come, you know well enough.”\n\n\n“But I do not.”\n\n\n“Not when you got me the place here as gardener?”\n\n\n“Answer me as though I knew nothing.”\n\n\n“Well, then, this is the Petit-Picpus convent.”\n\n\nMemories recurred to Jean Valjean. Chance, that is to say, Providence,\nhad cast him into precisely that convent in the Quartier Saint-Antoine\nwhere old Fauchelevent, crippled by the fall from his cart, had been\nadmitted on his recommendation two years previously. He repeated, as\nthough talking to himself:—\n\n“The Petit-Picpus convent.”\n\n\n“Exactly,” returned old Fauchelevent. “But to come to the point, how\nthe deuce did you manage to get in here, you, Father Madeleine? No\nmatter if you are a saint; you are a man as well, and no man enters\nhere.”\n\n\n“You certainly are here.”\n\n\n“There is no one but me.”\n\n\n“Still,” said Jean Valjean, “I must stay here.”\n\n\n“Ah, good God!” cried Fauchelevent.\n\nJean Valjean drew near to the old man, and said to him in a grave\nvoice:—\n\n“Father Fauchelevent, I saved your life.”\n\n\n“I was the first to recall it,” returned Fauchelevent.\n\n“Well, you can do to-day for me that which I did for you in the olden\ndays.”\n\n\nFauchelevent took in his aged, trembling, and wrinkled hands Jean\nValjean’s two robust hands, and stood for several minutes as though\nincapable of speaking. At length he exclaimed:—\n\n“Oh! that would be a blessing from the good God, if I could make you\nsome little return for that! Save your life! Monsieur le Maire, dispose\nof the old man!”\n\n\nA wonderful joy had transfigured this old man. His countenance seemed\nto emit a ray of light.\n\n“What do you wish me to do?” he resumed.\n\n“That I will explain to you. You have a chamber?”\n\n\n“I have an isolated hovel yonder, behind the ruins of the old convent,\nin a corner which no one ever looks into. There are three rooms in it.”\n\n\nThe hut was, in fact, so well hidden behind the ruins, and so cleverly\narranged to prevent it being seen, that Jean Valjean had not perceived\nit.\n\n“Good,” said Jean Valjean. “Now I am going to ask two things of you.”\n\n\n“What are they, Mr. Mayor?”\n\n\n“In the first place, you are not to tell any one what you know about\nme. In the second, you are not to try to find out anything more.”\n\n\n“As you please. I know that you can do nothing that is not honest, that\nyou have always been a man after the good God’s heart. And then,\nmoreover, you it was who placed me here. That concerns you. I am at\nyour service.”\n\n\n“That is settled then. Now, come with me. We will go and get the\nchild.”\n\n\n“Ah!” said Fauchelevent, “so there is a child?”\n\n\nHe added not a word further, and followed Jean Valjean as a dog follows\nhis master.\n\nLess than half an hour afterwards Cosette, who had grown rosy again\nbefore the flame of a good fire, was lying asleep in the old gardener’s\nbed. Jean Valjean had put on his cravat and coat once more; his hat,\nwhich he had flung over the wall, had been found and picked up. While\nJean Valjean was putting on his coat, Fauchelevent had removed the bell\nand kneecap, which now hung on a nail beside a vintage basket that\nadorned the wall. The two men were warming themselves with their elbows\nresting on a table upon which Fauchelevent had placed a bit of cheese,\nblack bread, a bottle of wine, and two glasses, and the old man was\nsaying to Jean Valjean, as he laid his hand on the latter’s knee: “Ah!\nFather Madeleine! You did not recognize me immediately; you save\npeople’s lives, and then you forget them! That is bad! But they\nremember you! You are an ingrate!”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X—WHICH EXPLAINS HOW JAVERT GOT ON THE SCENT\n\n\nThe events of which we have just beheld the reverse side, so to speak,\nhad come about in the simplest possible manner.\n\nWhen Jean Valjean, on the evening of the very day when Javert had\narrested him beside Fantine’s death-bed, had escaped from the town jail\nof M. sur M., the police had supposed that he had betaken himself to\nParis. Paris is a maelstrom where everything is lost, and everything\ndisappears in this belly of the world, as in the belly of the sea. No\nforest hides a man as does that crowd. Fugitives of every sort know\nthis. They go to Paris as to an abyss; there are gulfs which save. The\npolice know it also, and it is in Paris that they seek what they have\nlost elsewhere. They sought the ex-mayor of M. sur M. Javert was\nsummoned to Paris to throw light on their researches. Javert had, in\nfact, rendered powerful assistance in the recapture of Jean Valjean.\nJavert’s zeal and intelligence on that occasion had been remarked by M.\nChabouillet, secretary of the Prefecture under Comte Anglès. M.\nChabouillet, who had, moreover, already been Javert’s patron, had the\ninspector of M. sur M. attached to the police force of Paris. There\nJavert rendered himself useful in divers and, though the word may seem\nstrange for such services, honorable manners.\n\nHe no longer thought of Jean Valjean,—the wolf of to-day causes these\ndogs who are always on the chase to forget the wolf of yesterday,—when,\nin December, 1823, he read a newspaper, he who never read newspapers;\nbut Javert, a monarchical man, had a desire to know the particulars of\nthe triumphal entry of the “Prince Generalissimo” into Bayonne. Just as\nhe was finishing the article, which interested him; a name, the name of\nJean Valjean, attracted his attention at the bottom of a page. The\npaper announced that the convict Jean Valjean was dead, and published\nthe fact in such formal terms that Javert did not doubt it. He confined\nhimself to the remark, “That’s a good entry.” Then he threw aside the\npaper, and thought no more about it.\n\nSome time afterwards, it chanced that a police report was transmitted\nfrom the prefecture of the Seine-et-Oise to the prefecture of police in\nParis, concerning the abduction of a child, which had taken place,\nunder peculiar circumstances, as it was said, in the commune of\nMontfermeil. A little girl of seven or eight years of age, the report\nsaid, who had been intrusted by her mother to an inn-keeper of that\nneighborhood, had been stolen by a stranger; this child answered to the\nname of Cosette, and was the daughter of a girl named Fantine, who had\ndied in the hospital, it was not known where or when.\n\nThis report came under Javert’s eye and set him to thinking.\n\nThe name of Fantine was well known to him. He remembered that Jean\nValjean had made him, Javert, burst into laughter, by asking him for a\nrespite of three days, for the purpose of going to fetch that\ncreature’s child. He recalled the fact that Jean Valjean had been\narrested in Paris at the very moment when he was stepping into the\ncoach for Montfermeil. Some signs had made him suspect at the time that\nthis was the second occasion of his entering that coach, and that he\nhad already, on the previous day, made an excursion to the neighborhood\nof that village, for he had not been seen in the village itself. What\nhad he been intending to do in that region of Montfermeil? It could not\neven be surmised. Javert understood it now. Fantine’s daughter was\nthere. Jean Valjean was going there in search of her. And now this\nchild had been stolen by a stranger! Who could that stranger be? Could\nit be Jean Valjean? But Jean Valjean was dead. Javert, without saying\nanything to anybody, took the coach from the _Pewter Platter_,\nCul-de-Sac de la Planchette, and made a trip to Montfermeil.\n\nHe expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there; he\nfound a great deal of obscurity.\n\nFor the first few days the Thénardiers had chattered in their rage. The\ndisappearance of the Lark had created a sensation in the village. He\nimmediately obtained numerous versions of the story, which ended in the\nabduction of a child. Hence the police report. But their first vexation\nhaving passed off, Thénardier, with his wonderful instinct, had very\nquickly comprehended that it is never advisable to stir up the\nprosecutor of the Crown, and that his complaints with regard to the\n_abduction_ of Cosette would have as their first result to fix upon\nhimself, and upon many dark affairs which he had on hand, the\nglittering eye of justice. The last thing that owls desire is to have a\ncandle brought to them. And in the first place, how explain the fifteen\nhundred francs which he had received? He turned squarely round, put a\ngag on his wife’s mouth, and feigned astonishment when the _stolen\nchild_ was mentioned to him. He understood nothing about it; no doubt\nhe had grumbled for awhile at having that dear little creature “taken\nfrom him” so hastily; he should have liked to keep her two or three\ndays longer, out of tenderness; but her “grandfather” had come for her\nin the most natural way in the world. He added the “grandfather,” which\nproduced a good effect. This was the story that Javert hit upon when he\narrived at Montfermeil. The grandfather caused Jean Valjean to vanish.\n\nNevertheless, Javert dropped a few questions, like plummets, into\nThénardier’s history. “Who was that grandfather? and what was his\nname?” Thénardier replied with simplicity: “He is a wealthy farmer. I\nsaw his passport. I think his name was M. Guillaume Lambert.”\n\n\nLambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name. Thereupon\nJavert returned to Paris.\n\n“Jean Valjean is certainly dead,” said he, “and I am a ninny.”\n\n\nHe had again begun to forget this history, when, in the course of\nMarch, 1824, he heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the parish\nof Saint-Médard and who had been surnamed “the mendicant who gives\nalms.” This person, the story ran, was a man of means, whose name no\none knew exactly, and who lived alone with a little girl of eight\nyears, who knew nothing about herself, save that she had come from\nMontfermeil. Montfermeil! that name was always coming up, and it made\nJavert prick up his ears. An old beggar police spy, an ex-beadle, to\nwhom this person had given alms, added a few more details. This\ngentleman of property was very shy,—never coming out except in the\nevening, speaking to no one, except, occasionally to the poor, and\nnever allowing any one to approach him. He wore a horrible old yellow\nfrock-coat, which was worth many millions, being all wadded with\nbank-bills. This piqued Javert’s curiosity in a decided manner. In\norder to get a close look at this fantastic gentleman without alarming\nhim, he borrowed the beadle’s outfit for a day, and the place where the\nold spy was in the habit of crouching every evening, whining orisons\nthrough his nose, and playing the spy under cover of prayer.\n\n“The suspected individual” did indeed approach Javert thus disguised,\nand bestow alms on him. At that moment Javert raised his head, and the\nshock which Jean Valjean received on recognizing Javert was equal to\nthe one received by Javert when he thought he recognized Jean Valjean.\n\nHowever, the darkness might have misled him; Jean Valjean’s death was\nofficial; Javert cherished very grave doubts; and when in doubt,\nJavert, the man of scruples, never laid a finger on any one’s collar.\n\nHe followed his man to the Gorbeau house, and got “the old woman” to\ntalking, which was no difficult matter. The old woman confirmed the\nfact regarding the coat lined with millions, and narrated to him the\nepisode of the thousand-franc bill. She had seen it! She had handled\nit! Javert hired a room; that evening he installed himself in it. He\ncame and listened at the mysterious lodger’s door, hoping to catch the\nsound of his voice, but Jean Valjean saw his candle through the\nkey-hole, and foiled the spy by keeping silent.\n\nOn the following day Jean Valjean decamped; but the noise made by the\nfall of the five-franc piece was noticed by the old woman, who, hearing\nthe rattling of coin, suspected that he might be intending to leave,\nand made haste to warn Javert. At night, when Jean Valjean came out,\nJavert was waiting for him behind the trees of the boulevard with two\nmen.\n\nJavert had demanded assistance at the Prefecture, but he had not\nmentioned the name of the individual whom he hoped to seize; that was\nhis secret, and he had kept it for three reasons: in the first place,\nbecause the slightest indiscretion might put Jean Valjean on the alert;\nnext, because, to lay hands on an ex-convict who had made his escape\nand was reputed dead, on a criminal whom justice had formerly classed\nforever as _among malefactors of the most dangerous sort_, was a\nmagnificent success which the old members of the Parisian police would\nassuredly not leave to a newcomer like Javert, and he was afraid of\nbeing deprived of his convict; and lastly, because Javert, being an\nartist, had a taste for the unforeseen. He hated those well-heralded\nsuccesses which are talked of long in advance and have had the bloom\nbrushed off. He preferred to elaborate his masterpieces in the dark and\nto unveil them suddenly at the last.\n\nJavert had followed Jean Valjean from tree to tree, then from corner to\ncorner of the street, and had not lost sight of him for a single\ninstant; even at the moments when Jean Valjean believed himself to be\nthe most secure Javert’s eye had been on him. Why had not Javert\narrested Jean Valjean? Because he was still in doubt.\n\nIt must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not precisely\nat its ease; the free press embarrassed it; several arbitrary arrests\ndenounced by the newspapers, had echoed even as far as the Chambers,\nand had rendered the Prefecture timid. Interference with individual\nliberty was a grave matter. The police agents were afraid of making a\nmistake; the prefect laid the blame on them; a mistake meant dismissal.\nThe reader can imagine the effect which this brief paragraph,\nreproduced by twenty newspapers, would have caused in Paris:\n“Yesterday, an aged grandfather, with white hair, a respectable and\nwell-to-do gentleman, who was walking with his grandchild, aged eight,\nwas arrested and conducted to the agency of the Prefecture as an\nescaped convict!”\n\n\nLet us repeat in addition that Javert had scruples of his own;\ninjunctions of his conscience were added to the injunctions of the\nprefect. He was really in doubt.\n\nJean Valjean turned his back on him and walked in the dark.\n\nSadness, uneasiness, anxiety, depression, this fresh misfortune of\nbeing forced to flee by night, to seek a chance refuge in Paris for\nCosette and himself, the necessity of regulating his pace to the pace\nof the child—all this, without his being aware of it, had altered Jean\nValjean’s walk, and impressed on his bearing such senility, that the\npolice themselves, incarnate in the person of Javert, might, and did in\nfact, make a mistake. The impossibility of approaching too close, his\ncostume of an _émigré_ preceptor, the declaration of Thénardier which\nmade a grandfather of him, and, finally, the belief in his death in\nprison, added still further to the uncertainty which gathered thick in\nJavert’s mind.\n\nFor an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for his\npapers; but if the man was not Jean Valjean, and if this man was not a\ngood, honest old fellow living on his income, he was probably some\nmerry blade deeply and cunningly implicated in the obscure web of\nParisian misdeeds, some chief of a dangerous band, who gave alms to\nconceal his other talents, which was an old dodge. He had trusty\nfellows, accomplices’ retreats in case of emergencies, in which he\nwould, no doubt, take refuge. All these turns which he was making\nthrough the streets seemed to indicate that he was not a simple and\nhonest man. To arrest him too hastily would be “to kill the hen that\nlaid the golden eggs.” Where was the inconvenience in waiting? Javert\nwas very sure that he would not escape.\n\nThus he proceeded in a tolerably perplexed state of mind, putting to\nhimself a hundred questions about this enigmatical personage.\n\nIt was only quite late in the Rue de Pontoise, that, thanks to the\nbrilliant light thrown from a dram-shop, he decidedly recognized Jean\nValjean.\n\nThere are in this world two beings who give a profound start,—the\nmother who recovers her child and the tiger who recovers his prey.\nJavert gave that profound start.\n\nAs soon as he had positively recognized Jean Valjean, the formidable\nconvict, he perceived that there were only three of them, and he asked\nfor reinforcements at the police station of the Rue de Pontoise. One\nputs on gloves before grasping a thorn cudgel.\n\nThis delay and the halt at the Carrefour Rollin to consult with his\nagents came near causing him to lose the trail. He speedily divined,\nhowever, that Jean Valjean would want to put the river between his\npursuers and himself. He bent his head and reflected like a blood-hound\nwho puts his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the right\nscent. Javert, with his powerful rectitude of instinct, went straight\nto the bridge of Austerlitz. A word with the toll-keeper furnished him\nwith the information which he required: “Have you seen a man with a\nlittle girl?” “I made him pay two sous,” replied the toll-keeper.\nJavert reached the bridge in season to see Jean Valjean traverse the\nsmall illuminated spot on the other side of the water, leading Cosette\nby the hand. He saw him enter the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine; he\nremembered the Cul-de-Sac Genrot arranged there like a trap, and of the\nsole exit of the Rue Droit-Mur into the Rue Petit-Picpus. _He made sure\nof his back burrows_, as huntsmen say; he hastily despatched one of his\nagents, by a roundabout way, to guard that issue. A patrol which was\nreturning to the Arsenal post having passed him, he made a requisition\non it, and caused it to accompany him. In such games soldiers are aces.\nMoreover, the principle is, that in order to get the best of a wild\nboar, one must employ the science of venery and plenty of dogs. These\ncombinations having been effected, feeling that Jean Valjean was caught\nbetween the blind alley Genrot on the right, his agent on the left, and\nhimself, Javert, in the rear, he took a pinch of snuff.\n\nThen he began the game. He experienced one ecstatic and infernal\nmoment; he allowed his man to go on ahead, knowing that he had him\nsafe, but desirous of postponing the moment of arrest as long as\npossible, happy at the thought that he was taken and yet at seeing him\nfree, gloating over him with his gaze, with that voluptuousness of the\nspider which allows the fly to flutter, and of the cat which lets the\nmouse run. Claws and talons possess a monstrous sensuality,—the obscure\nmovements of the creature imprisoned in their pincers. What a delight\nthis strangling is!\n\nJavert was enjoying himself. The meshes of his net were stoutly\nknotted. He was sure of success; all he had to do now was to close his\nhand.\n\nAccompanied as he was, the very idea of resistance was impossible,\nhowever vigorous, energetic, and desperate Jean Valjean might be.\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nJavert on the Hunt  2b5-10-javert-on-the-hunt\n\n\nJavert advanced slowly, sounding, searching on his way all the nooks of\nthe street like so many pockets of thieves.\n\nWhen he reached the centre of the web he found the fly no longer there.\n\nHis exasperation can be imagined.\n\nHe interrogated his sentinel of the Rues Droit-Mur and Petit-Picpus;\nthat agent, who had remained imperturbably at his post, had not seen\nthe man pass.\n\nIt sometimes happens that a stag is lost head and horns; that is to\nsay, he escapes although he has the pack on his very heels, and then\nthe oldest huntsmen know not what to say. Duvivier, Ligniville, and\nDesprez halt short. In a discomfiture of this sort, Artonge exclaims,\n“It was not a stag, but a sorcerer.” Javert would have liked to utter\nthe same cry.\n\nHis disappointment bordered for a moment on despair and rage.\n\nIt is certain that Napoleon made mistakes during the war with Russia,\nthat Alexander committed blunders in the war in India, that Cæsar made\nmistakes in the war in Africa, that Cyrus was at fault in the war in\nScythia, and that Javert blundered in this campaign against Jean\nValjean. He was wrong, perhaps, in hesitating in his recognition of the\nexconvict. The first glance should have sufficed him. He was wrong in\nnot arresting him purely and simply in the old building; he was wrong\nin not arresting him when he positively recognized him in the Rue de\nPontoise. He was wrong in taking counsel with his auxiliaries in the\nfull light of the moon in the Carrefour Rollin. Advice is certainly\nuseful; it is a good thing to know and to interrogate those of the dogs\nwho deserve confidence; but the hunter cannot be too cautious when he\nis chasing uneasy animals like the wolf and the convict. Javert, by\ntaking too much thought as to how he should set the bloodhounds of the\npack on the trail, alarmed the beast by giving him wind of the dart,\nand so made him run. Above all, he was wrong in that after he had\npicked up the scent again on the bridge of Austerlitz, he played that\nformidable and puerile game of keeping such a man at the end of a\nthread. He thought himself stronger than he was, and believed that he\ncould play at the game of the mouse and the lion. At the same time, he\nreckoned himself as too weak, when he judged it necessary to obtain\nreinforcement. Fatal precaution, waste of precious time! Javert\ncommitted all these blunders, and nonetheless was one of the cleverest\nand most correct spies that ever existed. He was, in the full force of\nthe term, what is called in venery a _knowing dog_. But what is there\nthat is perfect?\n\nGreat strategists have their eclipses.\n\nThe greatest follies are often composed, like the largest ropes, of a\nmultitude of strands. Take the cable thread by thread, take all the\npetty determining motives separately, and you can break them one after\nthe other, and you say, “That is all there is of it!” Braid them, twist\nthem together; the result is enormous: it is Attila hesitating between\nMarcian on the east and Valentinian on the west; it is Hannibal\ntarrying at Capua; it is Danton falling asleep at Arcis-sur-Aube.\n\nHowever that may be, even at the moment when he saw that Jean Valjean\nhad escaped him, Javert did not lose his head. Sure that the convict\nwho had broken his ban could not be far off, he established sentinels,\nhe organized traps and ambuscades, and beat the quarter all that night.\nThe first thing he saw was the disorder in the street lantern whose\nrope had been cut. A precious sign which, however, led him astray,\nsince it caused him to turn all his researches in the direction of the\nCul-de-Sac Genrot. In this blind alley there were tolerably low walls\nwhich abutted on gardens whose bounds adjoined the immense stretches of\nwaste land. Jean Valjean evidently must have fled in that direction.\nThe fact is, that had he penetrated a little further in the Cul-de-Sac\nGenrot, he would probably have done so and have been lost. Javert\nexplored these gardens and these waste stretches as though he had been\nhunting for a needle.\n\nAt daybreak he left two intelligent men on the outlook, and returned to\nthe Prefecture of Police, as much ashamed as a police spy who had been\ncaptured by a robber might have been.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SIXTH—LE PETIT-PICPUS\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—NUMBER 62 RUE PETIT-PICPUS\n\n\nNothing, half a century ago, more resembled every other carriage gate\nthan the carriage gate of Number 62 Rue Petit-Picpus. This entrance,\nwhich usually stood ajar in the most inviting fashion, permitted a view\nof two things, neither of which have anything very funereal about\nthem,—a courtyard surrounded by walls hung with vines, and the face of\na lounging porter. Above the wall, at the bottom of the court, tall\ntrees were visible. When a ray of sunlight enlivened the courtyard,\nwhen a glass of wine cheered up the porter, it was difficult to pass\nNumber 62 Little Picpus Street without carrying away a smiling\nimpression of it. Nevertheless, it was a sombre place of which one had\nhad a glimpse.\n\nThe threshold smiled; the house prayed and wept.\n\nIf one succeeded in passing the porter, which was not easy,—which was\neven nearly impossible for every one, for there was an _open sesame!_\nwhich it was necessary to know,—if, the porter once passed, one entered\na little vestibule on the right, on which opened a staircase shut in\nbetween two walls and so narrow that only one person could ascend it at\na time, if one did not allow one’s self to be alarmed by a daubing of\ncanary yellow, with a dado of chocolate which clothed this staircase,\nif one ventured to ascend it, one crossed a first landing, then a\nsecond, and arrived on the first story at a corridor where the yellow\nwash and the chocolate-hued plinth pursued one with a peaceable\npersistency. Staircase and corridor were lighted by two beautiful\nwindows. The corridor took a turn and became dark. If one doubled this\ncape, one arrived a few paces further on, in front of a door which was\nall the more mysterious because it was not fastened. If one opened it,\none found one’s self in a little chamber about six feet square, tiled,\nwell-scrubbed, clean, cold, and hung with nankin paper with green\nflowers, at fifteen sous the roll. A white, dull light fell from a\nlarge window, with tiny panes, on the left, which usurped the whole\nwidth of the room. One gazed about, but saw no one; one listened, one\nheard neither a footstep nor a human murmur. The walls were bare, the\nchamber was not furnished; there was not even a chair.\n\nOne looked again, and beheld on the wall facing the door a quadrangular\nhole, about a foot square, with a grating of interlacing iron bars,\nblack, knotted, solid, which formed squares—I had almost said meshes—of\nless than an inch and a half in diagonal length. The little green\nflowers of the nankin paper ran in a calm and orderly manner to those\niron bars, without being startled or thrown into confusion by their\nfunereal contact. Supposing that a living being had been so wonderfully\nthin as to essay an entrance or an exit through the square hole, this\ngrating would have prevented it. It did not allow the passage of the\nbody, but it did allow the passage of the eyes; that is to say, of the\nmind. This seems to have occurred to them, for it had been re-enforced\nby a sheet of tin inserted in the wall a little in the rear, and\npierced with a thousand holes more microscopic than the holes of a\nstrainer. At the bottom of this plate, an aperture had been pierced\nexactly similar to the orifice of a letter box. A bit of tape attached\nto a bell-wire hung at the right of the grated opening.\n\nIf the tape was pulled, a bell rang, and one heard a voice very near at\nhand, which made one start.\n\n“Who is there?” the voice demanded.\n\nIt was a woman’s voice, a gentle voice, so gentle that it was mournful.\n\nHere, again, there was a magical word which it was necessary to know.\nIf one did not know it, the voice ceased, the wall became silent once\nmore, as though the terrified obscurity of the sepulchre had been on\nthe other side of it.\n\nIf one knew the password, the voice resumed, “Enter on the right.”\n\n\nOne then perceived on the right, facing the window, a glass door\nsurmounted by a frame glazed and painted gray. On raising the latch and\ncrossing the threshold, one experienced precisely the same impression\nas when one enters at the theatre into a grated _baignoire_, before the\ngrating is lowered and the chandelier is lighted. One was, in fact, in\na sort of theatre-box, narrow, furnished with two old chairs, and a\nmuch-frayed straw matting, sparely illuminated by the vague light from\nthe glass door; a regular box, with its front just of a height to lean\nupon, bearing a tablet of black wood. This box was grated, only the\ngrating of it was not of gilded wood, as at the opera; it was a\nmonstrous lattice of iron bars, hideously interlaced and riveted to the\nwall by enormous fastenings which resembled clenched fists.\n\nThe first minutes passed; when one’s eyes began to grow used to this\ncellar-like half-twilight, one tried to pass the grating, but got no\nfurther than six inches beyond it. There he encountered a barrier of\nblack shutters, re-enforced and fortified with transverse beams of wood\npainted a gingerbread yellow. These shutters were divided into long,\nnarrow slats, and they masked the entire length of the grating. They\nwere always closed. At the expiration of a few moments one heard a\nvoice proceeding from behind these shutters, and saying:—\n\n“I am here. What do you wish with me?”\n\n\nIt was a beloved, sometimes an adored, voice. No one was visible.\nHardly the sound of a breath was audible. It seemed as though it were a\nspirit which had been evoked, that was speaking to you across the walls\nof the tomb.\n\nIf one chanced to be within certain prescribed and very rare\nconditions, the slat of one of the shutters opened opposite you; the\nevoked spirit became an apparition. Behind the grating, behind the\nshutter, one perceived so far as the grating permitted sight, a head,\nof which only the mouth and the chin were visible; the rest was covered\nwith a black veil. One caught a glimpse of a black guimpe, and a form\nthat was barely defined, covered with a black shroud. That head spoke\nwith you, but did not look at you and never smiled at you.\n\nThe light which came from behind you was adjusted in such a manner that\nyou saw her in the white, and she saw you in the black. This light was\nsymbolical.\n\nNevertheless, your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening which was\nmade in that place shut off from all glances. A profound vagueness\nenveloped that form clad in mourning. Your eyes searched that\nvagueness, and sought to make out the surroundings of the apparition.\nAt the expiration of a very short time you discovered that you could\nsee nothing. What you beheld was night, emptiness, shadows, a wintry\nmist mingled with a vapor from the tomb, a sort of terrible peace, a\nsilence from which you could gather nothing, not even sighs, a gloom in\nwhich you could distinguish nothing, not even phantoms.\n\nWhat you beheld was the interior of a cloister.\n\nIt was the interior of that severe and gloomy edifice which was called\nthe Convent of the Bernardines of the Perpetual Adoration. The box in\nwhich you stood was the parlor. The first voice which had addressed you\nwas that of the portress who always sat motionless and silent, on the\nother side of the wall, near the square opening, screened by the iron\ngrating and the plate with its thousand holes, as by a double visor.\nThe obscurity which bathed the grated box arose from the fact that the\nparlor, which had a window on the side of the world, had none on the\nside of the convent. Profane eyes must see nothing of that sacred\nplace.\n\nNevertheless, there was something beyond that shadow; there was a\nlight; there was life in the midst of that death. Although this was the\nmost strictly walled of all convents, we shall endeavor to make our way\ninto it, and to take the reader in, and to say, without transgressing\nthe proper bounds, things which story-tellers have never seen, and\nhave, therefore, never described.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—THE OBEDIENCE OF MARTIN VERGA\n\n\nThis convent, which in 1824 had already existed for many a long year in\nthe Rue Petit-Picpus, was a community of Bernardines of the obedience\nof Martin Verga.\n\nThese Bernardines were attached, in consequence, not to Clairvaux, like\nthe Bernardine monks, but to Cîteaux, like the Benedictine monks. In\nother words, they were the subjects, not of Saint Bernard, but of Saint\nBenoît.\n\nAny one who has turned over old folios to any extent knows that Martin\nVerga founded in 1425 a congregation of Bernardines-Benedictines, with\nSalamanca for the head of the order, and Alcala as the branch\nestablishment.\n\nThis congregation had sent out branches throughout all the Catholic\ncountries of Europe.\n\nThere is nothing unusual in the Latin Church in these grafts of one\norder on another. To mention only a single order of Saint-Benoît, which\nis here in question: there are attached to this order, without counting\nthe obedience of Martin Verga, four congregations,—two in Italy,\nMont-Cassin and Sainte-Justine of Padua; two in France, Cluny and\nSaint-Maur; and nine orders,—Vallombrosa, Granmont, the Célestins, the\nCamaldules, the Carthusians, the Humiliés, the Olivateurs, the\nSilvestrins, and lastly, Cîteaux; for Cîteaux itself, a trunk for other\norders, is only an offshoot of Saint-Benoît. Cîteaux dates from Saint\nRobert, Abbé de Molesme, in the diocese of Langres, in 1098. Now it was\nin 529 that the devil, having retired to the desert of Subiaco—he was\nold—had he turned hermit?—was chased from the ancient temple of Apollo,\nwhere he dwelt, by Saint-Benoît, then aged seventeen.\n\nAfter the rule of the Carmelites, who go barefoot, wear a bit of willow\non their throats, and never sit down, the harshest rule is that of the\nBernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga. They are clothed in black,\nwith a guimpe, which, in accordance with the express command of\nSaint-Benoît, mounts to the chin. A robe of serge with large sleeves, a\nlarge woollen veil, the guimpe which mounts to the chin cut square on\nthe breast, the band which descends over their brow to their eyes,—this\nis their dress. All is black except the band, which is white. The\nnovices wear the same habit, but all in white. The professed nuns also\nwear a rosary at their side.\n\nThe Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga practise the Perpetual\nAdoration, like the Benedictines called Ladies of the Holy Sacrament,\nwho, at the beginning of this century, had two houses in Paris,—one at\nthe Temple, the other in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève. However, the\nBernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus, of whom we are speaking,\nwere a totally different order from the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament,\ncloistered in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève and at the Temple. There\nwere numerous differences in their rule; there were some in their\ncostume. The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus wore the\nblack guimpe, and the Benedictines of the Holy Sacrament and of the Rue\nNeuve-Sainte-Geneviève wore a white one, and had, besides, on their\nbreasts, a Holy Sacrament about three inches long, in silver gilt or\ngilded copper. The nuns of the Petit-Picpus did not wear this Holy\nSacrament. The Perpetual Adoration, which was common to the house of\nthe Petit-Picpus and to the house of the Temple, leaves those two\norders perfectly distinct. Their only resemblance lies in this practice\nof the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament and the Bernardines of Martin\nVerga, just as there existed a similarity in the study and the\nglorification of all the mysteries relating to the infancy, the life,\nand death of Jesus Christ and the Virgin, between the two orders, which\nwere, nevertheless, widely separated, and on occasion even hostile. The\nOratory of Italy, established at Florence by Philip de Neri, and the\nOratory of France, established by Pierre de Bérulle. The Oratory of\nFrance claimed the precedence, since Philip de Neri was only a saint,\nwhile Bérulle was a cardinal.\n\nLet us return to the harsh Spanish rule of Martin Verga.\n\nThe Bernardines-Benedictines of this obedience fast all the year round,\nabstain from meat, fast in Lent and on many other days which are\npeculiar to them, rise from their first sleep, from one to three\no’clock in the morning, to read their breviary and chant matins, sleep\nin all seasons between serge sheets and on straw, make no use of the\nbath, never light a fire, scourge themselves every Friday, observe the\nrule of silence, speak to each other only during the recreation hours,\nwhich are very brief, and wear drugget chemises for six months in the\nyear, from September 14th, which is the Exaltation of the Holy Cross,\nuntil Easter. These six months are a modification: the rule says all\nthe year, but this drugget chemise, intolerable in the heat of summer,\nproduced fevers and nervous spasms. The use of it had to be restricted.\nEven with this palliation, when the nuns put on this chemise on the\n14th of September, they suffer from fever for three or four days.\nObedience, poverty, chastity, perseverance in their seclusion,—these\nare their vows, which the rule greatly aggravates.\n\nThe prioress is elected for three years by the mothers, who are called\n_mères vocales_ because they have a voice in the chapter. A prioress\ncan only be re-elected twice, which fixes the longest possible reign of\na prioress at nine years.\n\nThey never see the officiating priest, who is always hidden from them\nby a serge curtain nine feet in height. During the sermon, when the\npreacher is in the chapel, they drop their veils over their faces. They\nmust always speak low, walk with their eyes on the ground and their\nheads bowed. One man only is allowed to enter the convent,—the\narchbishop of the diocese.\n\nThere is really one other,—the gardener. But he is always an old man,\nand, in order that he may always be alone in the garden, and that the\nnuns may be warned to avoid him, a bell is attached to his knee.\n\nTheir submission to the prioress is absolute and passive. It is the\ncanonical subjection in the full force of its abnegation. As at the\nvoice of Christ, _ut voci Christi_, at a gesture, at the first sign,\n_ad nutum, ad primum signum_, immediately, with cheerfulness, with\nperseverance, with a certain blind obedience, _prompte, hilariter,\nperseveranter et cæca quadam obedientia_, as the file in the hand of\nthe workman, _quasi limam in manibus fabri_, without power to read or\nto write without express permission, _legere vel scribere non\naddiscerit sine expressa superioris licentia_.\n\nEach one of them in turn makes what they call _reparation_. The\nreparation is the prayer for all the sins, for all the faults, for all\nthe dissensions, for all the violations, for all the iniquities, for\nall the crimes committed on earth. For the space of twelve consecutive\nhours, from four o’clock in the afternoon till four o’clock in the\nmorning, or from four o’clock in the morning until four o’clock in the\nafternoon, the sister who is making _reparation_ remains on her knees\non the stone before the Holy Sacrament, with hands clasped, a rope\naround her neck. When her fatigue becomes unendurable, she prostrates\nherself flat on her face against the earth, with her arms outstretched\nin the form of a cross; this is her only relief. In this attitude she\nprays for all the guilty in the universe. This is great to sublimity.\n\nAs this act is performed in front of a post on which burns a candle, it\nis called without distinction, _to make reparation_ or _to be at the\npost_. The nuns even prefer, out of humility, this last expression,\nwhich contains an idea of torture and abasement.\n\n_To make reparation_ is a function in which the whole soul is absorbed.\nThe sister at the post would not turn round were a thunderbolt to fall\ndirectly behind her.\n\nBesides this, there is always a sister kneeling before the Holy\nSacrament. This station lasts an hour. They relieve each other like\nsoldiers on guard. This is the Perpetual Adoration.\n\nThe prioresses and the mothers almost always bear names stamped with\npeculiar solemnity, recalling, not the saints and martyrs, but moments\nin the life of Jesus Christ: as Mother Nativity, Mother Conception,\nMother Presentation, Mother Passion. But the names of saints are not\ninterdicted.\n\nWhen one sees them, one never sees anything but their mouths.\n\nAll their teeth are yellow. No tooth-brush ever entered that convent.\nBrushing one’s teeth is at the top of a ladder at whose bottom is the\nloss of one’s soul.\n\nThey never say _my_. They possess nothing of their own, and they must\nnot attach themselves to anything. They call everything _our_; thus:\nour veil, our chaplet; if they were speaking of their chemise, they\nwould say _our chemise_. Sometimes they grow attached to some petty\nobject,—to a book of hours, a relic, a medal that has been blessed. As\nsoon as they become aware that they are growing attached to this\nobject, they must give it up. They recall the words of Saint Thérèse,\nto whom a great lady said, as she was on the point of entering her\norder, “Permit me, mother, to send for a Bible to which I am greatly\nattached.” “Ah, you are attached to something! In that case, do not\nenter our order!”\n\n\nEvery person whatever is forbidden to shut herself up, to have _a place\nof her own, a chamber_. They live with their cells open. When they\nmeet, one says, “Blessed and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the\naltar!” The other responds, “Forever.” The same ceremony when one taps\nat the other’s door. Hardly has she touched the door when a soft voice\non the other side is heard to say hastily, “Forever!” Like all\npractices, this becomes mechanical by force of habit; and one sometimes\nsays _forever_ before the other has had time to say the rather long\nsentence, “Praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar.”\n\n\nAmong the Visitandines the one who enters says: “Ave Maria,” and the\none whose cell is entered says, “Gratia plena.” It is their way of\nsaying good day, which is in fact full of grace.\n\nAt each hour of the day three supplementary strokes sound from the\nchurch bell of the convent. At this signal prioress, vocal mothers,\nprofessed nuns, lay-sisters, novices, postulants, interrupt what they\nare saying, what they are doing, or what they are thinking, and all say\nin unison if it is five o’clock, for instance, “At five o’clock and at\nall hours praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar!”\nIf it is eight o’clock, “At eight o’clock and at all hours!” and so on,\naccording to the hour.\n\nThis custom, the object of which is to break the thread of thought and\nto lead it back constantly to God, exists in many communities; the\nformula alone varies. Thus at The Infant Jesus they say, “At this hour\nand at every hour may the love of Jesus kindle my heart!” The\nBernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga, cloistered fifty years ago at\nPetit-Picpus, chant the offices to a solemn psalmody, a pure Gregorian\nchant, and always with full voice during the whole course of the\noffice. Everywhere in the missal where an asterisk occurs they pause,\nand say in a low voice, “Jesus-Marie-Joseph.” For the office of the\ndead they adopt a tone so low that the voices of women can hardly\ndescend to such a depth. The effect produced is striking and tragic.\n\nThe nuns of the Petit-Picpus had made a vault under their grand altar\nfor the burial of their community. _The Government_, as they say, does\nnot permit this vault to receive coffins so they leave the convent when\nthey die. This is an affliction to them, and causes them consternation\nas an infraction of the rules.\n\nThey had obtained a mediocre consolation at best,—permission to be\ninterred at a special hour and in a special corner in the ancient\nVaugirard cemetery, which was made of land which had formerly belonged\nto their community.\n\nOn Fridays the nuns hear high mass, vespers, and all the offices, as on\nSunday. They scrupulously observe in addition all the little festivals\nunknown to people of the world, of which the Church of France was so\nprodigal in the olden days, and of which it is still prodigal in Spain\nand Italy. Their stations in the chapel are interminable. As for the\nnumber and duration of their prayers we can convey no better idea of\nthem than by quoting the ingenuous remark of one of them: “The prayers\nof the postulants are frightful, the prayers of the novices are still\nworse, and the prayers of the professed nuns are still worse.”\n\n\nOnce a week the chapter assembles: the prioress presides; the vocal\nmothers assist. Each sister kneels in turn on the stones, and confesses\naloud, in the presence of all, the faults and sins which she has\ncommitted during the week. The vocal mothers consult after each\nconfession and inflict the penance aloud.\n\nBesides this confession in a loud tone, for which all faults in the\nleast serious are reserved, they have for their venial offences what\nthey call the _coulpe. To make one’s coulpe_ means to prostrate one’s\nself flat on one’s face during the office in front of the prioress\nuntil the latter, who is never called anything but _our mother_,\nnotifies the culprit by a slight tap of her foot against the wood of\nher stall that she can rise. The _coulpe_ or _peccavi_, is made for a\nvery small matter—a broken glass, a torn veil, an involuntary delay of\na few seconds at an office, a false note in church, etc.; this\nsuffices, and the _coulpe_ is made. The _coulpe_ is entirely\nspontaneous; it is the culpable person herself (the word is\netymologically in its place here) who judges herself and inflicts it on\nherself. On festival days and Sundays four mother precentors intone the\noffices before a large reading-desk with four places. One day one of\nthe mother precentors intoned a psalm beginning with _Ecce_, and\ninstead of _Ecce_ she uttered aloud the three notes _do si sol_; for\nthis piece of absent-mindedness she underwent a _coulpe_ which lasted\nduring the whole service: what rendered the fault enormous was the fact\nthat the chapter had laughed.\n\nWhen a nun is summoned to the parlor, even were it the prioress\nherself, she drops her veil, as will be remembered, so that only her\nmouth is visible.\n\nThe prioress alone can hold communication with strangers. The others\ncan see only their immediate family, and that very rarely. If, by\nchance, an outsider presents herself to see a nun, or one whom she has\nknown and loved in the outer world, a regular series of negotiations is\nrequired. If it is a woman, the authorization may sometimes be granted;\nthe nun comes, and they talk to her through the shutters, which are\nopened only for a mother or sister. It is unnecessary to say that\npermission is always refused to men.\n\nSuch is the rule of Saint-Benoît, aggravated by Martin Verga.\n\nThese nuns are not gay, rosy, and fresh, as the daughters of other\norders often are. They are pale and grave. Between 1825 and 1830 three\nof them went mad.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—AUSTERITIES\n\n\nOne is a postulant for two years at least, often for four; a novice for\nfour. It is rare that the definitive vows can be pronounced earlier\nthan the age of twenty-three or twenty-four years. The\nBernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga do not admit widows to their\norder.\n\nIn their cells, they deliver themselves up to many unknown macerations,\nof which they must never speak.\n\nOn the day when a novice makes her profession, she is dressed in her\nhandsomest attire, she is crowned with white roses, her hair is brushed\nuntil it shines, and curled. Then she prostrates herself; a great black\nveil is thrown over her, and the office for the dead is sung. Then the\nnuns separate into two files; one file passes close to her, saying in\nplaintive accents, “Our sister is dead”; and the other file responds in\na voice of ecstasy, “Our sister is alive in Jesus Christ!”\n\n\nAt the epoch when this story takes place, a boarding-school was\nattached to the convent—a boarding-school for young girls of noble and\nmostly wealthy families, among whom could be remarked Mademoiselle de\nSaint-Aulaire and de Bélissen, and an English girl bearing the\nillustrious Catholic name of Talbot. These young girls, reared by these\nnuns between four walls, grew up with a horror of the world and of the\nage. One of them said to us one day, “The sight of the street pavement\nmade me shudder from head to foot.” They were dressed in blue, with a\nwhite cap and a Holy Spirit of silver gilt or of copper on their\nbreast. On certain grand festival days, particularly Saint Martha’s\nday, they were permitted, as a high favor and a supreme happiness, to\ndress themselves as nuns and to carry out the offices and practice of\nSaint-Benoît for a whole day. In the early days the nuns were in the\nhabit of lending them their black garments. This seemed profane, and\nthe prioress forbade it. Only the novices were permitted to lend. It is\nremarkable that these performances, tolerated and encouraged, no doubt,\nin the convent out of a secret spirit of proselytism and in order to\ngive these children a foretaste of the holy habit, were a genuine\nhappiness and a real recreation for the scholars. They simply amused\nthemselves with it. _It was new; it gave them a change_. Candid reasons\nof childhood, which do not, however, succeed in making us worldlings\ncomprehend the felicity of holding a holy water sprinkler in one’s hand\nand standing for hours together singing hard enough for four in front\nof a reading-desk.\n\nThe pupils conformed, with the exception of the austerities, to all the\npractices of the convent. There was a certain young woman who entered\nthe world, and who after many years of married life had not succeeded\nin breaking herself of the habit of saying in great haste whenever any\none knocked at her door, “forever!” Like the nuns, the pupils saw their\nrelatives only in the parlor. Their very mothers did not obtain\npermission to embrace them. The following illustrates to what a degree\nseverity on that point was carried. One day a young girl received a\nvisit from her mother, who was accompanied by a little sister three\nyears of age. The young girl wept, for she wished greatly to embrace\nher sister. Impossible. She begged that, at least, the child might be\npermitted to pass her little hand through the bars so that she could\nkiss it. This was almost indignantly refused.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—GAYETIES\n\n\nNonetheless, these young girls filled this grave house with charming\nsouvenirs.\n\nAt certain hours childhood sparkled in that cloister. The recreation\nhour struck. A door swung on its hinges. The birds said, “Good; here\ncome the children!” An irruption of youth inundated that garden\nintersected with a cross like a shroud. Radiant faces, white foreheads,\ninnocent eyes, full of merry light, all sorts of auroras, were\nscattered about amid these shadows. After the psalmodies, the bells,\nthe peals, and knells and offices, the sound of these little girls\nburst forth on a sudden more sweetly than the noise of bees. The hive\nof joy was opened, and each one brought her honey. They played, they\ncalled to each other, they formed into groups, they ran about; pretty\nlittle white teeth chattered in the corners; the veils superintended\nthe laughs from a distance, shades kept watch of the sunbeams, but what\nmattered it? Still they beamed and laughed. Those four lugubrious walls\nhad their moment of dazzling brilliancy. They looked on, vaguely\nblanched with the reflection of so much joy at this sweet swarming of\nthe hives. It was like a shower of roses falling athwart this house of\nmourning. The young girls frolicked beneath the eyes of the nuns; the\ngaze of impeccability does not embarrass innocence. Thanks to these\nchildren, there was, among so many austere hours, one hour of\ningenuousness. The little ones skipped about; the elder ones danced. In\nthis cloister play was mingled with heaven. Nothing is so delightful\nand so august as all these fresh, expanding young souls. Homer would\nhave come thither to laugh with Perrault; and there was in that black\ngarden, youth, health, noise, cries, giddiness, pleasure, happiness\nenough to smooth out the wrinkles of all their ancestresses, those of\nthe epic as well as those of the fairy-tale, those of the throne as\nwell as those of the thatched cottage from Hecuba to la Mère-Grand.\n\nIn that house more than anywhere else, perhaps, arise those children’s\nsayings which are so graceful and which evoke a smile that is full of\nthoughtfulness. It was between those four gloomy walls that a child of\nfive years exclaimed one day: “Mother! one of the big girls has just\ntold me that I have only nine years and ten months longer to remain\nhere. What happiness!”\n\n\nIt was here, too, that this memorable dialogue took place:—\n\n_A Vocal Mother_. Why are you weeping, my child?\n\n_The child_ (aged six). I told Alix that I knew my French history. She\nsays that I do not know it, but I do.\n\n_Alix_, the big girl (aged nine). No; she does not know it.\n\n_The Mother_. How is that, my child?\n\n_Alix_. She told me to open the book at random and to ask her any\nquestion in the book, and she would answer it.\n\n“Well?”\n\n\n“She did not answer it.”\n\n\n“Let us see about it. What did you ask her?”\n\n\n“I opened the book at random, as she proposed, and I put the first\nquestion that I came across.”\n\n\n“And what was the question?”\n\n\n“It was, ‘What happened after that?’”\n\n\nIt was there that that profound remark was made anent a rather greedy\nparoquet which belonged to a lady boarder:—\n\n“How well bred! it eats the top of the slice of bread and butter just\nlike a person!”\n\n\nIt was on one of the flagstones of this cloister that there was once\npicked up a confession which had been written out in advance, in order\nthat she might not forget it, by a sinner of seven years:—\n\n“Father, I accuse myself of having been avaricious.\n\n“Father, I accuse myself of having been an adulteress.\n\n“Father, I accuse myself of having raised my eyes to the gentlemen.”\n\n\nIt was on one of the turf benches of this garden that a rosy mouth six\nyears of age improvised the following tale, which was listened to by\nblue eyes aged four and five years:—\n\n“There were three little cocks who owned a country where there were a\ngreat many flowers. They plucked the flowers and put them in their\npockets. After that they plucked the leaves and put them in their\nplaythings. There was a wolf in that country; there was a great deal of\nforest; and the wolf was in the forest; and he ate the little cocks.”\n\n\nAnd this other poem:—\n\n“There came a blow with a stick.\n\n“It was Punchinello who bestowed it on the cat.\n\n“It was not good for her; it hurt her.\n\n“Then a lady put Punchinello in prison.”\n\n\nIt was there that a little abandoned child, a foundling whom the\nconvent was bringing up out of charity, uttered this sweet and\nheart-breaking saying. She heard the others talking of their mothers,\nand she murmured in her corner:—\n\n“As for me, my mother was not there when I was born!”\n\n\nThere was a stout portress who could always be seen hurrying through\nthe corridors with her bunch of keys, and whose name was Sister Agatha.\nThe _big big girls_—those over ten years of age—called her\n_Agathocles_.\n\nThe refectory, a large apartment of an oblong square form, which\nreceived no light except through a vaulted cloister on a level with the\ngarden, was dark and damp, and, as the children say, full of beasts.\nAll the places round about furnished their contingent of insects.\n\nEach of its four corners had received, in the language of the pupils, a\nspecial and expressive name. There was Spider corner, Caterpillar\ncorner, Wood-louse corner, and Cricket corner.\n\nCricket corner was near the kitchen and was highly esteemed. It was not\nso cold there as elsewhere. From the refectory the names had passed to\nthe boarding-school, and there served as in the old College Mazarin to\ndistinguish four nations. Every pupil belonged to one of these four\nnations according to the corner of the refectory in which she sat at\nmeals. One day Monseigneur the Archbishop while making his pastoral\nvisit saw a pretty little rosy girl with beautiful golden hair enter\nthe class-room through which he was passing.\n\nHe inquired of another pupil, a charming brunette with rosy cheeks, who\nstood near him:—\n\n“Who is that?”\n\n\n“She is a spider, Monseigneur.”\n\n\n“Bah! And that one yonder?”\n\n\n“She is a cricket.”\n\n\n“And that one?”\n\n\n“She is a caterpillar.”\n\n\n“Really! and yourself?”\n\n\n“I am a wood-louse, Monseigneur.”\n\n\nEvery house of this sort has its own peculiarities. At the beginning of\nthis century Écouen was one of those strict and graceful places where\nyoung girls pass their childhood in a shadow that is almost august. At\nÉcouen, in order to take rank in the procession of the Holy Sacrament,\na distinction was made between virgins and florists. There were also\nthe “dais” and the “censors,”—the first who held the cords of the dais,\nand the others who carried incense before the Holy Sacrament. The\nflowers belonged by right to the florists. Four “virgins” walked in\nadvance. On the morning of that great day it was no rare thing to hear\nthe question put in the dormitory, “Who is a virgin?”\n\n\nMadame Campan used to quote this saying of a “little one” of seven\nyears, to a “big girl” of sixteen, who took the head of the procession,\nwhile she, the little one, remained at the rear, “You are a virgin, but\nI am not.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—DISTRACTIONS\n\n\nAbove the door of the refectory this prayer, which was called the\n_white Paternoster_, and which possessed the property of bearing people\nstraight to paradise, was inscribed in large black letters:—\n\n“Little white Paternoster, which God made, which God said, which God\nplaced in paradise. In the evening, when I went to bed, I found three\nangels sitting on my bed, one at the foot, two at the head, the good\nVirgin Mary in the middle, who told me to lie down without hesitation.\nThe good God is my father, the good Virgin is my mother, the three\napostles are my brothers, the three virgins are my sisters. The shirt\nin which God was born envelopes my body; Saint Margaret’s cross is\nwritten on my breast. Madame the Virgin was walking through the\nmeadows, weeping for God, when she met M. Saint John. ‘Monsieur Saint\nJohn, whence come you?’ ‘I come from _Ave Salus_.’ ‘You have not seen\nthe good God; where is he?’ ‘He is on the tree of the Cross, his feet\nhanging, his hands nailed, a little cap of white thorns on his head.’\nWhoever shall say this thrice at eventide, thrice in the morning, shall\nwin paradise at the last.”\n\n\nIn 1827 this characteristic orison had disappeared from the wall under\na triple coating of daubing paint. At the present time it is finally\ndisappearing from the memories of several who were young girls then,\nand who are old women now.\n\nA large crucifix fastened to the wall completed the decoration of this\nrefectory, whose only door, as we think we have mentioned, opened on\nthe garden. Two narrow tables, each flanked by two wooden benches,\nformed two long parallel lines from one end to the other of the\nrefectory. The walls were white, the tables were black; these two\nmourning colors constitute the only variety in convents. The meals were\nplain, and the food of the children themselves severe. A single dish of\nmeat and vegetables combined, or salt fish—such was their luxury. This\nmeagre fare, which was reserved for the pupils alone, was,\nnevertheless, an exception. The children ate in silence, under the eye\nof the mother whose turn it was, who, if a fly took a notion to fly or\nto hum against the rule, opened and shut a wooden book from time to\ntime. This silence was seasoned with the lives of the saints, read\naloud from a little pulpit with a desk, which was situated at the foot\nof the crucifix. The reader was one of the big girls, in weekly turn.\nAt regular distances, on the bare tables, there were large, varnished\nbowls in which the pupils washed their own silver cups and knives and\nforks, and into which they sometimes threw some scrap of tough meat or\nspoiled fish; this was punished. These bowls were called _ronds d’eau_.\nThe child who broke the silence “made a cross with her tongue.” Where?\nOn the ground. She licked the pavement. The dust, that end of all joys,\nwas charged with the chastisement of those poor little rose-leaves\nwhich had been guilty of chirping.\n\nThere was in the convent a book which has never been printed except as\na _unique copy_, and which it is forbidden to read. It is the rule of\nSaint-Benoît. An arcanum which no profane eye must penetrate. _Nemo\nregulas, seu constitutiones nostras, externis communicabit_.\n\nThe pupils one day succeeded in getting possession of this book, and\nset to reading it with avidity, a reading which was often interrupted\nby the fear of being caught, which caused them to close the volume\nprecipitately.\n\nFrom the great danger thus incurred they derived but a very moderate\namount of pleasure. The most “interesting thing” they found were some\nunintelligible pages about the sins of young boys.\n\nThey played in an alley of the garden bordered with a few shabby\nfruit-trees. In spite of the extreme surveillance and the severity of\nthe punishments administered, when the wind had shaken the trees, they\nsometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple or a spoiled apricot or\nan inhabited pear on the sly. I will now cede the privilege of speech\nto a letter which lies before me, a letter written five and twenty\nyears ago by an old pupil, now Madame la Duchesse de ——, one of the\nmost elegant women in Paris. I quote literally: “One hides one’s pear\nor one’s apple as best one may. When one goes upstairs to put the veil\non the bed before supper, one stuffs them under one’s pillow and at\nnight one eats them in bed, and when one cannot do that, one eats them\nin the closet.” That was one of their greatest luxuries.\n\nOnce—it was at the epoch of the visit from the archbishop to the\nconvent—one of the young girls, Mademoiselle Bouchard, who was\nconnected with the Montmorency family, laid a wager that she would ask\nfor a day’s leave of absence—an enormity in so austere a community. The\nwager was accepted, but not one of those who bet believed that she\nwould do it. When the moment came, as the archbishop was passing in\nfront of the pupils, Mademoiselle Bouchard, to the indescribable terror\nof her companions, stepped out of the ranks, and said, “Monseigneur, a\nday’s leave of absence.” Mademoiselle Bouchard was tall, blooming, with\nthe prettiest little rosy face in the world. M. de Quélen smiled and\nsaid, “What, my dear child, a day’s leave of absence! Three days if you\nlike. I grant you three days.” The prioress could do nothing; the\narchbishop had spoken. Horror of the convent, but joy of the pupil. The\neffect may be imagined.\n\nThis stern cloister was not so well walled off, however, but that the\nlife of the passions of the outside world, drama, and even romance, did\nnot make their way in. To prove this, we will confine ourselves to\nrecording here and to briefly mentioning a real and incontestable fact,\nwhich, however, bears no reference in itself to, and is not connected\nby any thread whatever with the story which we are relating. We mention\nthe fact for the sake of completing the physiognomy of the convent in\nthe reader’s mind.\n\nAbout this time there was in the convent a mysterious person who was\nnot a nun, who was treated with great respect, and who was addressed as\n_Madame Albertine_. Nothing was known about her, save that she was mad,\nand that in the world she passed for dead. Beneath this history it was\nsaid there lay the arrangements of fortune necessary for a great\nmarriage.\n\nThis woman, hardly thirty years of age, of dark complexion and\ntolerably pretty, had a vague look in her large black eyes. Could she\nsee? There was some doubt about this. She glided rather than walked,\nshe never spoke; it was not quite known whether she breathed. Her\nnostrils were livid and pinched as after yielding up their last sigh.\nTo touch her hand was like touching snow. She possessed a strange\nspectral grace. Wherever she entered, people felt cold. One day a\nsister, on seeing her pass, said to another sister, “She passes for a\ndead woman.” “Perhaps she is one,” replied the other.\n\nA hundred tales were told of Madame Albertine. This arose from the\neternal curiosity of the pupils. In the chapel there was a gallery\ncalled _L‘Œil de Bœuf_. It was in this gallery, which had only a\ncircular bay, an _œil de bœuf_, that Madame Albertine listened to the\noffices. She always occupied it alone because this gallery, being on\nthe level of the first story, the preacher or the officiating priest\ncould be seen, which was interdicted to the nuns. One day the pulpit\nwas occupied by a young priest of high rank, M. Le Duc de Rohan, peer\nof France, officer of the Red Musketeers in 1815 when he was Prince de\nLéon, and who died afterward, in 1830, as cardinal and Archbishop of\nBesançon. It was the first time that M. de Rohan had preached at the\nPetit-Picpus convent. Madame Albertine usually preserved perfect\ncalmness and complete immobility during the sermons and services. That\nday, as soon as she caught sight of M. de Rohan, she half rose, and\nsaid, in a loud voice, amid the silence of the chapel, “Ah! Auguste!”\nThe whole community turned their heads in amazement, the preacher\nraised his eyes, but Madame Albertine had relapsed into her immobility.\nA breath from the outer world, a flash of life, had passed for an\ninstant across that cold and lifeless face and had then vanished, and\nthe mad woman had become a corpse again.\n\nThose two words, however, had set every one in the convent who had the\nprivilege of speech to chattering. How many things were contained in\nthat “Ah! Auguste!” what revelations! M. de Rohan’s name really was\nAuguste. It was evident that Madame Albertine belonged to the very\nhighest society, since she knew M. de Rohan, and that her own rank\nthere was of the highest, since she spoke thus familiarly of so great a\nlord, and that there existed between them some connection, of\nrelationship, perhaps, but a very close one in any case, since she knew\nhis “pet name.”\n\n\nTwo very severe duchesses, Mesdames de Choiseul and de Sérent, often\nvisited the community, whither they penetrated, no doubt, in virtue of\nthe privilege _Magnates mulieres_, and caused great consternation in\nthe boarding-school. When these two old ladies passed by, all the poor\nyoung girls trembled and dropped their eyes.\n\nMoreover, M. de Rohan, quite unknown to himself, was an object of\nattention to the school-girls. At that epoch he had just been made,\nwhile waiting for the episcopate, vicar-general of the Archbishop of\nParis. It was one of his habits to come tolerably often to celebrate\nthe offices in the chapel of the nuns of the Petit-Picpus. Not one of\nthe young recluses could see him, because of the serge curtain, but he\nhad a sweet and rather shrill voice, which they had come to know and to\ndistinguish. He had been a mousquetaire, and then, he was said to be\nvery coquettish, that his handsome brown hair was very well dressed in\na roll around his head, and that he had a broad girdle of magnificent\nmoire, and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut in the\nworld. He held a great place in all these imaginations of sixteen\nyears.\n\nNot a sound from without made its way into the convent. But there was\none year when the sound of a flute penetrated thither. This was an\nevent, and the girls who were at school there at the time still recall\nit.\n\nIt was a flute which was played in the neighborhood. This flute always\nplayed the same air, an air which is very far away nowadays,—“My\nZétulbé, come reign o’er my soul,”—and it was heard two or three times\na day. The young girls passed hours in listening to it, the vocal\nmothers were upset by it, brains were busy, punishments descended in\nshowers. This lasted for several months. The girls were all more or\nless in love with the unknown musician. Each one dreamed that she was\nZétulbé. The sound of the flute proceeded from the direction of the Rue\nDroit-Mur; and they would have given anything, compromised everything,\nattempted anything for the sake of seeing, of catching a glance, if\nonly for a second, of the “young man” who played that flute so\ndeliciously, and who, no doubt, played on all these souls at the same\ntime. There were some who made their escape by a back door, and\nascended to the third story on the Rue Droit-Mur side, in order to\nattempt to catch a glimpse through the gaps. Impossible! One even went\nso far as to thrust her arm through the grating, and to wave her white\nhandkerchief. Two were still bolder. They found means to climb on a\nroof, and risked their lives there, and succeeded at last in seeing\n“the young man.” He was an old _émigré_ gentleman, blind and penniless,\nwho was playing his flute in his attic, in order to pass the time.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—THE LITTLE CONVENT\n\n\nIn this enclosure of the Petit-Picpus there were three perfectly\ndistinct buildings,—the Great Convent, inhabited by the nuns, the\nBoarding-school, where the scholars were lodged; and lastly, what was\ncalled the Little Convent. It was a building with a garden, in which\nlived all sorts of aged nuns of various orders, the relics of cloisters\ndestroyed in the Revolution; a reunion of all the black, gray, and\nwhite medleys of all communities and all possible varieties; what might\nbe called, if such a coupling of words is permissible, a sort of\nharlequin convent.\n\nWhen the Empire was established, all these poor old dispersed and\nexiled women had been accorded permission to come and take shelter\nunder the wings of the Bernardines-Benedictines. The government paid\nthem a small pension, the ladies of the Petit-Picpus received them\ncordially. It was a singular pell-mell. Each followed her own rule.\nSometimes the pupils of the boarding-school were allowed, as a great\nrecreation, to pay them a visit; the result is, that all those young\nmemories have retained among other souvenirs that of Mother\nSainte-Bazile, Mother Sainte-Scolastique, and Mother Jacob.\n\nOne of these refugees found herself almost at home. She was a nun of\nSainte-Aure, the only one of her order who had survived. The ancient\nconvent of the ladies of Sainte-Aure occupied, at the beginning of the\neighteenth century, this very house of the Petit-Picpus, which belonged\nlater to the Benedictines of Martin Verga. This holy woman, too poor to\nwear the magnificent habit of her order, which was a white robe with a\nscarlet scapulary, had piously put it on a little manikin, which she\nexhibited with complacency and which she bequeathed to the house at her\ndeath. In 1824, only one nun of this order remained; to-day, there\nremains only a doll.\n\nIn addition to these worthy mothers, some old society women had\nobtained permission of the prioress, like Madame Albertine, to retire\ninto the Little Convent. Among the number were Madame Beaufort\nd’Hautpoul and Marquise Dufresne. Another was never known in the\nconvent except by the formidable noise which she made when she blew her\nnose. The pupils called her Madame Vacarmini (hubbub).\n\nAbout 1820 or 1821, Madame de Genlis, who was at that time editing a\nlittle periodical publication called _l’Intrépide_, asked to be allowed\nto enter the convent of the Petit-Picpus as lady resident. The Duc\nd’Orléans recommended her. Uproar in the hive; the vocal-mothers were\nall in a flutter; Madame de Genlis had made romances. But she declared\nthat she was the first to detest them, and then, she had reached her\nfierce stage of devotion. With the aid of God, and of the Prince, she\nentered. She departed at the end of six or eight months, alleging as a\nreason, that there was no shade in the garden. The nuns were delighted.\nAlthough very old, she still played the harp, and did it very well.\n\nWhen she went away she left her mark in her cell. Madame de Genlis was\nsuperstitious and a Latinist. These two words furnish a tolerably good\nprofile of her. A few years ago, there were still to be seen, pasted in\nthe inside of a little cupboard in her cell in which she locked up her\nsilverware and her jewels, these five lines in Latin, written with her\nown hand in red ink on yellow paper, and which, in her opinion,\npossessed the property of frightening away robbers:—\n\nImparibus meritis pendent tria corpora ramis:\nDismas et Gesmas, media est divina potestas;\nAlta petit Dismas, infelix, infima, Gesmas;\nNos et res nostras conservet summa potestas.\nHos versus dicas, ne tu furto tua perdas.15\n\n\nThese verses in sixth century Latin raise the question whether the two\nthieves of Calvary were named, as is commonly believed, Dismas and\nGestas, or Dismas and Gesmas. This orthography might have confounded\nthe pretensions put forward in the last century by the Vicomte de\nGestas, of a descent from the wicked thief. However, the useful virtue\nattached to these verses forms an article of faith in the order of the\nHospitallers.\n\nThe church of the house, constructed in such a manner as to separate\nthe Great Convent from the Boarding-school like a veritable\nintrenchment, was, of course, common to the Boarding-school, the Great\nConvent, and the Little Convent. The public was even admitted by a sort\nof lazaretto entrance on the street. But all was so arranged, that none\nof the inhabitants of the cloister could see a face from the outside\nworld. Suppose a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand, and\nfolded in such a manner as to form, not, as in ordinary churches, a\nprolongation behind the altar, but a sort of hall, or obscure cellar,\nto the right of the officiating priest; suppose this hall to be shut\noff by a curtain seven feet in height, of which we have already spoken;\nin the shadow of that curtain, pile up on wooden stalls the nuns in the\nchoir on the left, the school-girls on the right, the lay-sisters and\nthe novices at the bottom, and you will have some idea of the nuns of\nthe Petit-Picpus assisting at divine service. That cavern, which was\ncalled the choir, communicated with the cloister by a lobby. The church\nwas lighted from the garden. When the nuns were present at services\nwhere their rule enjoined silence, the public was warned of their\npresence only by the folding seats of the stalls noisily rising and\nfalling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—SOME SILHOUETTES OF THIS DARKNESS\n\n\nDuring the six years which separate 1819 from 1825, the prioress of the\nPetit-Picpus was Mademoiselle de Blemeur, whose name, in religion, was\nMother Innocente. She came of the family of Marguerite de Blemeur,\nauthor of _Lives of the Saints of the Order of Saint-Benoît_. She had\nbeen re-elected. She was a woman about sixty years of age, short,\nthick, “singing like a cracked pot,” says the letter which we have\nalready quoted; an excellent woman, moreover, and the only merry one in\nthe whole convent, and for that reason adored. She was learned,\nerudite, wise, competent, curiously proficient in history, crammed with\nLatin, stuffed with Greek, full of Hebrew, and more of a Benedictine\nmonk than a Benedictine nun.\n\nThe sub-prioress was an old Spanish nun, Mother Cineres, who was almost\nblind.\n\nThe most esteemed among the vocal mothers were Mother Sainte-Honorine;\nthe treasurer, Mother Sainte-Gertrude, the chief mistress of the\nnovices; Mother-Saint-Ange, the assistant mistress; Mother\nAnnonciation, the sacristan; Mother Saint-Augustin, the nurse, the only\none in the convent who was malicious; then Mother Sainte-Mechtilde\n(Mademoiselle Gauvain), very young and with a beautiful voice; Mother\ndes Anges (Mademoiselle Drouet), who had been in the convent of the\nFilles-Dieu, and in the convent du Trésor, between Gisors and Magny;\nMother Saint-Joseph (Mademoiselle de Cogolludo), Mother Sainte-Adélaide\n(Mademoiselle d’Auverney), Mother Miséricorde (Mademoiselle de\nCifuentes, who could not resist austerities), Mother Compassion\n(Mademoiselle de la Miltière, received at the age of sixty in defiance\nof the rule, and very wealthy); Mother Providence (Mademoiselle de\nLaudinière), Mother Présentation (Mademoiselle de Siguenza), who was\nprioress in 1847; and finally, Mother Sainte-Céligne (sister of the\nsculptor Ceracchi), who went mad; Mother Sainte-Chantal (Mademoiselle\nde Suzon), who went mad.\n\nThere was also, among the prettiest of them, a charming girl of three\nand twenty, who was from the Isle de Bourbon, a descendant of the\nChevalier Roze, whose name had been Mademoiselle Roze, and who was\ncalled Mother Assumption.\n\nMother Sainte-Mechtilde, intrusted with the singing and the choir, was\nfond of making use of the pupils in this quarter. She usually took a\ncomplete scale of them, that is to say, seven, from ten to sixteen\nyears of age, inclusive, of assorted voices and sizes, whom she made\nsing standing, drawn up in a line, side by side, according to age, from\nthe smallest to the largest. This presented to the eye, something in\nthe nature of a reed-pipe of young girls, a sort of living Pan-pipe\nmade of angels.\n\nThose of the lay-sisters whom the scholars loved most were Sister\nEuphrasie, Sister Sainte-Marguérite, Sister Sainte-Marthe, who was in\nher dotage, and Sister Sainte-Michel, whose long nose made them laugh.\n\nAll these women were gentle with the children. The nuns were severe\nonly towards themselves. No fire was lighted except in the school, and\nthe food was choice compared to that in the convent. Moreover, they\nlavished a thousand cares on their scholars. Only, when a child passed\nnear a nun and addressed her, the nun never replied.\n\nThis rule of silence had had this effect, that throughout the whole\nconvent, speech had been withdrawn from human creatures, and bestowed\non inanimate objects. Now it was the church-bell which spoke, now it\nwas the gardener’s bell. A very sonorous bell, placed beside the\nportress, and which was audible throughout the house, indicated by its\nvaried peals, which formed a sort of acoustic telegraph, all the\nactions of material life which were to be performed, and summoned to\nthe parlor, in case of need, such or such an inhabitant of the house.\nEach person and each thing had its own peal. The prioress had one and\none, the sub-prioress one and two. Six-five announced lessons, so that\nthe pupils never said “to go to lessons,” but “to go to six-five.”\nFour-four was Madame de Genlis’s signal. It was very often heard.\n“C’est le diable a quatre,”—it’s the very deuce—said the uncharitable.\nTennine strokes announced a great event. It was the opening of _the\ndoor of seclusion_, a frightful sheet of iron bristling with bolts\nwhich only turned on its hinges in the presence of the archbishop.\n\nWith the exception of the archbishop and the gardener, no man entered\nthe convent, as we have already said. The schoolgirls saw two others:\none, the chaplain, the Abbé Banés, old and ugly, whom they were\npermitted to contemplate in the choir, through a grating; the other the\ndrawing-master, M. Ansiaux, whom the letter, of which we have perused a\nfew lines, calls _M. Anciot_, and describes as _a frightful old\nhunchback_.\n\nIt will be seen that all these men were carefully chosen.\n\nSuch was this curious house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—POST CORDA LAPIDES\n\n\nAfter having sketched its moral face, it will not prove unprofitable to\npoint out, in a few words, its material configuration. The reader\nalready has some idea of it.\n\nThe convent of the Petit-Picpus-Sainte-Antoine filled almost the whole\nof the vast trapezium which resulted from the intersection of the Rue\nPolonceau, the Rue Droit-Mur, the Rue Petit-Picpus, and the unused\nlane, called Rue Aumarais on old plans. These four streets surrounded\nthis trapezium like a moat. The convent was composed of several\nbuildings and a garden. The principal building, taken in its entirety,\nwas a juxtaposition of hybrid constructions which, viewed from a\nbird’s-eye view, outlined, with considerable exactness, a gibbet laid\nflat on the ground. The main arm of the gibbet occupied the whole of\nthe fragment of the Rue Droit-Mur comprised between the Rue\nPetit-Picpus and the Rue Polonceau; the lesser arm was a lofty, gray,\nsevere grated façade which faced the Rue Petit-Picpus; the carriage\nentrance No. 62 marked its extremity. Towards the centre of this façade\nwas a low, arched door, whitened with dust and ashes, where the spiders\nwove their webs, and which was open only for an hour or two on Sundays,\nand on rare occasions, when the coffin of a nun left the convent. This\nwas the public entrance of the church. The elbow of the gibbet was a\nsquare hall which was used as the servants’ hall, and which the nuns\ncalled _the buttery_. In the main arm were the cells of the mothers,\nthe sisters, and the novices. In the lesser arm lay the kitchens, the\nrefectory, backed up by the cloisters and the church. Between the door\nNo. 62 and the corner of the closed Aumarais Lane, was the school,\nwhich was not visible from without. The remainder of the trapezium\nformed the garden, which was much lower than the level of the Rue\nPolonceau, which caused the walls to be very much higher on the inside\nthan on the outside. The garden, which was slightly arched, had in its\ncentre, on the summit of a hillock, a fine pointed and conical\nfir-tree, whence ran, as from the peaked boss of a shield, four grand\nalleys, and, ranged by twos in between the branchings of these, eight\nsmall ones, so that, if the enclosure had been circular, the\ngeometrical plan of the alleys would have resembled a cross superposed\non a wheel. As the alleys all ended in the very irregular walls of the\ngarden, they were of unequal length. They were bordered with currant\nbushes. At the bottom, an alley of tall poplars ran from the ruins of\nthe old convent, which was at the angle of the Rue Droit-Mur to the\nhouse of the Little Convent, which was at the angle of the Aumarais\nLane. In front of the Little Convent was what was called the little\ngarden. To this whole, let the reader add a courtyard, all sorts of\nvaried angles formed by the interior buildings, prison walls, the long\nblack line of roofs which bordered the other side of the Rue Polonceau\nfor its sole perspective and neighborhood, and he will be able to form\nfor himself a complete image of what the house of the Bernardines of\nthe Petit-Picpus was forty years ago. This holy house had been built on\nthe precise site of a famous tennis-ground of the fourteenth to the\nsixteenth century, which was called the “tennis-ground of the eleven\nthousand devils.”\n\n\nAll these streets, moreover, were more ancient than Paris. These names,\nDroit-Mur and Aumarais, are very ancient; the streets which bear them\nare very much more ancient still. Aumarais Lane was called Maugout\nLane; the Rue Droit-Mur was called the Rue des Églantiers, for God\nopened flowers before man cut stones.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—A CENTURY UNDER A GUIMPE\n\n\nSince we are engaged in giving details as to what the convent of the\nPetit-Picpus was in former times, and since we have ventured to open a\nwindow on that discreet retreat, the reader will permit us one other\nlittle digression, utterly foreign to this book, but characteristic and\nuseful, since it shows that the cloister even has its original figures.\n\nIn the Little Convent there was a centenarian who came from the Abbey\nof Fontevrault. She had even been in society before the Revolution. She\ntalked a great deal of M. de Miromesnil, Keeper of the Seals under\nLouis XVI. and of a Presidentess Duplat, with whom she had been very\nintimate. It was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on\nevery pretext. She told wonders of the Abbey of Fontevrault,—that it\nwas like a city, and that there were streets in the monastery.\n\nShe talked with a Picard accent which amused the pupils. Every year,\nshe solemnly renewed her vows, and at the moment of taking the oath,\nshe said to the priest, “Monseigneur Saint-François gave it to\nMonseigneur Saint-Julien, Monseigneur Saint-Julien gave it to\nMonseigneur Saint-Eusebius, Monseigneur Saint-Eusebius gave it to\nMonseigneur Saint-Procopius, etc., etc.; and thus I give it to you,\nfather.” And the school-girls would begin to laugh, not in their\nsleeves, but under their veils; charming little stifled laughs which\nmade the vocal mothers frown.\n\nOn another occasion, the centenarian was telling stories. She said that\n_in her youth the Bernardine monks were every whit as good as the\nmousquetaires_. It was a century which spoke through her, but it was\nthe eighteenth century. She told about the custom of the four wines,\nwhich existed before the Revolution in Champagne and Bourgogne. When a\ngreat personage, a marshal of France, a prince, a duke, and a peer,\ntraversed a town in Burgundy or Champagne, the city fathers came out to\nharangue him and presented him with four silver gondolas into which\nthey had poured four different sorts of wine. On the first goblet this\ninscription could be read, _monkey wine_; on the second, _lion wine_;\non the third, _sheep wine_; on the fourth, _hog wine_. These four\nlegends express the four stages descended by the drunkard; the first,\nintoxication, which enlivens; the second, that which irritates; the\nthird, that which dulls; and the fourth, that which brutalizes.\n\nIn a cupboard, under lock and key, she kept a mysterious object of\nwhich she thought a great deal. The rule of Fontevrault did not forbid\nthis. She would not show this object to anyone. She shut herself up,\nwhich her rule allowed her to do, and hid herself, every time that she\ndesired to contemplate it. If she heard a footstep in the corridor, she\nclosed the cupboard again as hastily as it was possible with her aged\nhands. As soon as it was mentioned to her, she became silent, she who\nwas so fond of talking. The most curious were baffled by her silence\nand the most tenacious by her obstinacy. Thus it furnished a subject of\ncomment for all those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent. What\ncould that treasure of the centenarian be, which was so precious and so\nsecret? Some holy book, no doubt? Some unique chaplet? Some authentic\nrelic? They lost themselves in conjectures. When the poor old woman\ndied, they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting,\nperhaps, and opened it. They found the object beneath a triple linen\ncloth, like some consecrated paten. It was a Faenza platter\nrepresenting little Loves flitting away pursued by apothecary lads\narmed with enormous syringes. The chase abounds in grimaces and in\ncomical postures. One of the charming little Loves is already fairly\nspitted. He is resisting, fluttering his tiny wings, and still making\nan effort to fly, but the dancer is laughing with a satanical air.\nMoral: Love conquered by the colic. This platter, which is very\ncurious, and which had, possibly, the honor of furnishing Molière with\nan idea, was still in existence in September, 1845; it was for sale by\na bric-à-brac merchant in the Boulevard Beaumarchais.\n\nThis good old woman would not receive any visits from outside\n_because_, said she, the _parlor is too gloomy_.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X—ORIGIN OF THE PERPETUAL ADORATION\n\n\nHowever, this almost sepulchral parlor, of which we have sought to\nconvey an idea, is a purely local trait which is not reproduced with\nthe same severity in other convents. At the convent of the Rue du\nTemple, in particular, which belonged, in truth, to another order, the\nblack shutters were replaced by brown curtains, and the parlor itself\nwas a salon with a polished wood floor, whose windows were draped in\nwhite muslin curtains and whose walls admitted all sorts of frames, a\nportrait of a Benedictine nun with unveiled face, painted bouquets, and\neven the head of a Turk.\n\nIt is in that garden of the Temple convent, that stood that famous\nchestnut-tree which was renowned as the finest and the largest in\nFrance, and which bore the reputation among the good people of the\neighteenth century of being _the father of all the chestnut trees of\nthe realm_.\n\nAs we have said, this convent of the Temple was occupied by\nBenedictines of the Perpetual Adoration, Benedictines quite different\nfrom those who depended on Cîteaux. This order of the Perpetual\nAdoration is not very ancient and does not go back more than two\nhundred years. In 1649 the holy sacrament was profaned on two occasions\na few days apart, in two churches in Paris, at Saint-Sulpice and at\nSaint-Jean en Grève, a rare and frightful sacrilege which set the whole\ntown in an uproar. M. the Prior and Vicar-General of Saint-Germain des\nPrés ordered a solemn procession of all his clergy, in which the Pope’s\nNuncio officiated. But this expiation did not satisfy two sainted\nwomen, Madame Courtin, Marquise de Boucs, and the Comtesse de\nChâteauvieux. This outrage committed on “the most holy sacrament of the\naltar,” though but temporary, would not depart from these holy souls,\nand it seemed to them that it could only be extenuated by a “Perpetual\nAdoration” in some female monastery. Both of them, one in 1652, the\nother in 1653, made donations of notable sums to Mother Catherine de\nBar, called of the Holy Sacrament, a Benedictine nun, for the purpose\nof founding, to this pious end, a monastery of the order of\nSaint-Benoît; the first permission for this foundation was given to\nMother Catherine de Bar by M. de Metz, Abbé of Saint-Germain, “on\ncondition that no woman could be received unless she contributed three\nhundred livres income, which amounts to six thousand livres, to the\nprincipal.” After the Abbé of Saint-Germain, the king accorded\nletters-patent; and all the rest, abbatial charter, and royal letters,\nwas confirmed in 1654 by the Chamber of Accounts and the Parliament.\n\nSuch is the origin of the legal consecration of the establishment of\nthe Benedictines of the Perpetual Adoration of the Holy Sacrament at\nParis. Their first convent was “a new building” in the Rue Cassette,\nout of the contributions of Mesdames de Boucs and de Châteauvieux.\n\nThis order, as it will be seen, was not to be confounded with the\nBenedictine nuns of Cîteaux. It mounted back to the Abbé of\nSaint-Germain des Prés, in the same manner that the ladies of the\nSacred Heart go back to the general of the Jesuits, and the sisters of\ncharity to the general of the Lazarists.\n\nIt was also totally different from the Bernardines of the Petit-Picpus,\nwhose interior we have just shown. In 1657, Pope Alexander VII. had\nauthorized, by a special brief, the Bernardines of the Rue\nPetit-Picpus, to practise the Perpetual Adoration like the Benedictine\nnuns of the Holy Sacrament. But the two orders remained distinct\nnonetheless.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI—END OF THE PETIT-PICPUS\n\n\nAt the beginning of the Restoration, the convent of the Petit-Picpus\nwas in its decay; this forms a part of the general death of the order,\nwhich, after the eighteenth century, has been disappearing like all the\nreligious orders. Contemplation is, like prayer, one of humanity’s\nneeds; but, like everything which the Revolution touched, it will be\ntransformed, and from being hostile to social progress, it will become\nfavorable to it.\n\nThe house of the Petit-Picpus was becoming rapidly depopulated. In\n1840, the Little Convent had disappeared, the school had disappeared.\nThere were no longer any old women, nor young girls; the first were\ndead, the latter had taken their departure. _Volaverunt_.\n\nThe rule of the Perpetual Adoration is so rigid in its nature that it\nalarms, vocations recoil before it, the order receives no recruits. In\n1845, it still obtained lay-sisters here and there. But of professed\nnuns, none at all. Forty years ago, the nuns numbered nearly a hundred;\nfifteen years ago there were not more than twenty-eight of them. How\nmany are there to-day? In 1847, the prioress was young, a sign that the\ncircle of choice was restricted. She was not forty years old. In\nproportion as the number diminishes, the fatigue increases, the service\nof each becomes more painful; the moment could then be seen drawing\nnear when there would be but a dozen bent and aching shoulders to bear\nthe heavy rule of Saint-Benoît. The burden is implacable, and remains\nthe same for the few as for the many. It weighs down, it crushes. Thus\nthey die. At the period when the author of this book still lived in\nParis, two died. One was twenty-five years old, the other twenty-three.\nThis latter can say, like Julia Alpinula: _“Hic jaceo. Vixi annos\nviginti et tres.” _ It is in consequence of this decay that the convent\ngave up the education of girls.\n\nWe have not felt able to pass before this extraordinary house without\nentering it, and without introducing the minds which accompany us, and\nwhich are listening to our tale, to the profit of some, perchance, of\nthe melancholy history of Jean Valjean. We have penetrated into this\ncommunity, full of those old practices which seem so novel to-day. It\nis the closed garden, _hortus conclusus_. We have spoken of this\nsingular place in detail, but with respect, in so far, at least, as\ndetail and respect are compatible. We do not understand all, but we\ninsult nothing. We are equally far removed from the hosanna of Joseph\nde Maistre, who wound up by anointing the executioner, and from the\nsneer of Voltaire, who even goes so far as to ridicule the cross.\n\nAn illogical act on Voltaire’s part, we may remark, by the way; for\nVoltaire would have defended Jesus as he defended Calas; and even for\nthose who deny superhuman incarnations, what does the crucifix\nrepresent? The assassinated sage.\n\nIn this nineteenth century, the religious idea is undergoing a crisis.\nPeople are unlearning certain things, and they do well, provided that,\nwhile unlearning them they learn this: There is no vacuum in the human\nheart. Certain demolitions take place, and it is well that they do, but\non condition that they are followed by reconstructions.\n\nIn the meantime, let us study things which are no more. It is necessary\nto know them, if only for the purpose of avoiding them. The\ncounterfeits of the past assume false names, and gladly call themselves\nthe future. This spectre, this past, is given to falsifying its own\npassport. Let us inform ourselves of the trap. Let us be on our guard.\nThe past has a visage, superstition, and a mask, hypocrisy. Let us\ndenounce the visage and let us tear off the mask.\n\nAs for convents, they present a complex problem,—a question of\ncivilization, which condemns them; a question of liberty, which\nprotects them.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SEVENTH—PARENTHESIS\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE CONVENT AS AN ABSTRACT IDEA\n\n\nThis book is a drama, whose leading personage is the Infinite.\n\nMan is the second.\n\nSuch being the case, and a convent having happened to be on our road,\nit has been our duty to enter it. Why? Because the convent, which is\ncommon to the Orient as well as to the Occident, to antiquity as well\nas to modern times, to paganism, to Buddhism, to Mahometanism, as well\nas to Christianity, is one of the optical apparatuses applied by man to\nthe Infinite.\n\nThis is not the place for enlarging disproportionately on certain\nideas; nevertheless, while absolutely maintaining our reserves, our\nrestrictions, and even our indignations, we must say that every time we\nencounter man in the Infinite, either well or ill understood, we feel\nourselves overpowered with respect. There is, in the synagogue, in the\nmosque, in the pagoda, in the wigwam, a hideous side which we execrate,\nand a sublime side, which we adore. What a contemplation for the mind,\nand what endless food for thought, is the reverberation of God upon the\nhuman wall!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—THE CONVENT AS AN HISTORICAL FACT\n\n\nFrom the point of view of history, of reason, and of truth, monasticism\nis condemned. Monasteries, when they abound in a nation, are clogs in\nits circulation, cumbrous establishments, centres of idleness where\ncentres of labor should exist. Monastic communities are to the great\nsocial community what the mistletoe is to the oak, what the wart is to\nthe human body. Their prosperity and their fatness mean the\nimpoverishment of the country. The monastic regime, good at the\nbeginning of civilization, useful in the reduction of the brutal by the\nspiritual, is bad when peoples have reached their manhood. Moreover,\nwhen it becomes relaxed, and when it enters into its period of\ndisorder, it becomes bad for the very reasons which rendered it\nsalutary in its period of purity, because it still continues to set the\nexample.\n\nClaustration has had its day. Cloisters, useful in the early education\nof modern civilization, have embarrassed its growth, and are injurious\nto its development. So far as institution and formation with relation\nto man are concerned, monasteries, which were good in the tenth\ncentury, questionable in the fifteenth, are detestable in the\nnineteenth. The leprosy of monasticism has gnawed nearly to a skeleton\ntwo wonderful nations, Italy and Spain; the one the light, the other\nthe splendor of Europe for centuries; and, at the present day, these\ntwo illustrious peoples are but just beginning to convalesce, thanks to\nthe healthy and vigorous hygiene of 1789 alone.\n\nThe convent—the ancient female convent in particular, such as it still\npresents itself on the threshold of this century, in Italy, in Austria,\nin Spain—is one of the most sombre concretions of the Middle Ages. The\ncloister, that cloister, is the point of intersection of horrors. The\nCatholic cloister, properly speaking, is wholly filled with the black\nradiance of death.\n\nThe Spanish convent is the most funereal of all. There rise, in\nobscurity, beneath vaults filled with gloom, beneath domes vague with\nshadow, massive altars of Babel, as high as cathedrals; there immense\nwhite crucifixes hang from chains in the dark; there are extended, all\nnude on the ebony, great Christs of ivory; more than bleeding,—bloody;\nhideous and magnificent, with their elbows displaying the bones, their\nknee-pans showing their integuments, their wounds showing their flesh,\ncrowned with silver thorns, nailed with nails of gold, with blood drops\nof rubies on their brows, and diamond tears in their eyes. The diamonds\nand rubies seem wet, and make veiled beings in the shadow below weep,\ntheir sides bruised with the hair shirt and their iron-tipped scourges,\ntheir breasts crushed with wicker hurdles, their knees excoriated with\nprayer; women who think themselves wives, spectres who think themselves\nseraphim. Do these women think? No. Have they any will? No. Do they\nlove? No. Do they live? No. Their nerves have turned to bone; their\nbones have turned to stone. Their veil is of woven night. Their breath\nunder their veil resembles the indescribably tragic respiration of\ndeath. The abbess, a spectre, sanctifies them and terrifies them. The\nimmaculate one is there, and very fierce. Such are the ancient\nmonasteries of Spain. Liars of terrible devotion, caverns of virgins,\nferocious places.\n\nCatholic Spain is more Roman than Rome herself. The Spanish convent\nwas, above all others, the Catholic convent. There was a flavor of the\nOrient about it. The archbishop, the kislar-aga of heaven, locked up\nand kept watch over this seraglio of souls reserved for God. The nun\nwas the odalisque, the priest was the eunuch. The fervent were chosen\nin dreams and possessed Christ. At night, the beautiful, nude young man\ndescended from the cross and became the ecstasy of the cloistered one.\nLofty walls guarded the mystic sultana, who had the crucified for her\nsultan, from all living distraction. A glance on the outer world was\ninfidelity. The _in pace_ replaced the leather sack. That which was\ncast into the sea in the East was thrown into the ground in the West.\nIn both quarters, women wrung their hands; the waves for the first, the\ngrave for the last; here the drowned, there the buried. Monstrous\nparallel.\n\nTo-day the upholders of the past, unable to deny these things, have\nadopted the expedient of smiling at them. There has come into fashion a\nstrange and easy manner of suppressing the revelations of history, of\ninvalidating the commentaries of philosophy, of eliding all\nembarrassing facts and all gloomy questions. _A matter for\ndeclamations_, say the clever. Declamations, repeat the foolish.\nJean-Jacques a declaimer; Diderot a declaimer; Voltaire on Calas,\nLabarre, and Sirven, declaimers. I know not who has recently discovered\nthat Tacitus was a declaimer, that Nero was a victim, and that pity is\ndecidedly due to “that poor Holofernes.”\n\n\nFacts, however, are awkward things to disconcert, and they are\nobstinate. The author of this book has seen, with his own eyes, eight\nleagues distant from Brussels,—there are relics of the Middle Ages\nthere which are attainable for everybody,—at the Abbey of Villers, the\nhole of the oubliettes, in the middle of the field which was formerly\nthe courtyard of the cloister, and on the banks of the Thil, four stone\ndungeons, half under ground, half under the water. They were _in pace_.\nEach of these dungeons has the remains of an iron door, a vault, and a\ngrated opening which, on the outside, is two feet above the level of\nthe river, and on the inside, six feet above the level of the ground.\nFour feet of river flow past along the outside wall. The ground is\nalways soaked. The occupant of the _in pace_ had this wet soil for his\nbed. In one of these dungeons, there is a fragment of an iron necklet\nriveted to the wall; in another, there can be seen a square box made of\nfour slabs of granite, too short for a person to lie down in, too low\nfor him to stand upright in. A human being was put inside, with a\ncoverlid of stone on top. This exists. It can be seen. It can be\ntouched. These _in pace_, these dungeons, these iron hinges, these\nnecklets, that lofty peep-hole on a level with the river’s current,\nthat box of stone closed with a lid of granite like a tomb, with this\ndifference, that the dead man here was a living being, that soil which\nis but mud, that vault hole, those oozing walls,—what declaimers!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—ON WHAT CONDITIONS ONE CAN RESPECT THE PAST\n\n\nMonasticism, such as it existed in Spain, and such as it still exists\nin Thibet, is a sort of phthisis for civilization. It stops life short.\nIt simply depopulates. Claustration, castration. It has been the\nscourge of Europe. Add to this the violence so often done to the\nconscience, the forced vocations, feudalism bolstered up by the\ncloister, the right of the first-born pouring the excess of the family\ninto monasticism, the ferocities of which we have just spoken, the _in\npace_, the closed mouths, the walled-up brains, so many unfortunate\nminds placed in the dungeon of eternal vows, the taking of the habit,\nthe interment of living souls. Add individual tortures to national\ndegradations, and, whoever you may be, you will shudder before the\nfrock and the veil,—those two winding-sheets of human devising.\nNevertheless, at certain points and in certain places, in spite of\nphilosophy, in spite of progress, the spirit of the cloister persists\nin the midst of the nineteenth century, and a singular ascetic\nrecrudescence is, at this moment, astonishing the civilized world. The\nobstinacy of antiquated institutions in perpetuating themselves\nresembles the stubbornness of the rancid perfume which should claim our\nhair, the pretensions of the spoiled fish which should persist in being\neaten, the persecution of the child’s garment which should insist on\nclothing the man, the tenderness of corpses which should return to\nembrace the living.\n\n“Ingrates!” says the garment, “I protected you in inclement weather.\nWhy will you have nothing to do with me?” “I have just come from the\ndeep sea,” says the fish. “I have been a rose,” says the perfume. “I\nhave loved you,” says the corpse. “I have civilized you,” says the\nconvent.\n\nTo this there is but one reply: “In former days.”\n\n\nTo dream of the indefinite prolongation of defunct things, and of the\ngovernment of men by embalming, to restore dogmas in a bad condition,\nto regild shrines, to patch up cloisters, to rebless reliquaries, to\nrefurnish superstitions, to revictual fanaticisms, to put new handles\non holy water brushes and militarism, to reconstitute monasticism and\nmilitarism, to believe in the salvation of society by the\nmultiplication of parasites, to force the past on the present,—this\nseems strange. Still, there are theorists who hold such theories. These\ntheorists, who are in other respects people of intelligence, have a\nvery simple process; they apply to the past a glazing which they call\nsocial order, divine right, morality, family, the respect of elders,\nantique authority, sacred tradition, legitimacy, religion; and they go\nabout shouting, “Look! take this, honest people.” This logic was known\nto the ancients. The soothsayers practise it. They rubbed a black\nheifer over with chalk, and said, “She is white, _Bos cretatus_.”\n\n\nAs for us, we respect the past here and there, and we spare it, above\nall, provided that it consents to be dead. If it insists on being\nalive, we attack it, and we try to kill it.\n\nSuperstitions, bigotries, affected devotion, prejudices, those forms,\nall forms as they are, are tenacious of life; they have teeth and nails\nin their smoke, and they must be clasped close, body to body, and war\nmust be made on them, and that without truce; for it is one of the\nfatalities of humanity to be condemned to eternal combat with phantoms.\nIt is difficult to seize darkness by the throat, and to hurl it to the\nearth.\n\nA convent in France, in the broad daylight of the nineteenth century,\nis a college of owls facing the light. A cloister, caught in the very\nact of asceticism, in the very heart of the city of ’89 and of 1830 and\nof 1848, Rome blossoming out in Paris, is an anachronism. In ordinary\ntimes, in order to dissolve an anachronism and to cause it to vanish,\none has only to make it spell out the date. But we are not in ordinary\ntimes.\n\nLet us fight.\n\nLet us fight, but let us make a distinction. The peculiar property of\ntruth is never to commit excesses. What need has it of exaggeration?\nThere is that which it is necessary to destroy, and there is that which\nit is simply necessary to elucidate and examine. What a force is kindly\nand serious examination! Let us not apply a flame where only a light is\nrequired.\n\nSo, given the nineteenth century, we are opposed, as a general\nproposition, and among all peoples, in Asia as well as in Europe, in\nIndia as well as in Turkey, to ascetic claustration. Whoever says\ncloister, says marsh. Their putrescence is evident, their stagnation is\nunhealthy, their fermentation infects people with fever, and etiolates\nthem; their multiplication becomes a plague of Egypt. We cannot think\nwithout affright of those lands where fakirs, bonzes, santons, Greek\nmonks, marabouts, talapoins, and dervishes multiply even like swarms of\nvermin.\n\nThis said, the religious question remains. This question has certain\nmysterious, almost formidable sides; may we be permitted to look at it\nfixedly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—THE CONVENT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF PRINCIPLES\n\n\nMen unite themselves and dwell in communities. By virtue of what right?\nBy virtue of the right of association.\n\nThey shut themselves up at home. By virtue of what right? By virtue of\nthe right which every man has to open or shut his door.\n\nThey do not come forth. By virtue of what right? By virtue of the right\nto go and come, which implies the right to remain at home.\n\nThere, at home, what do they do?\n\nThey speak in low tones; they drop their eyes; they toil. They renounce\nthe world, towns, sensualities, pleasures, vanities, pride, interests.\nThey are clothed in coarse woollen or coarse linen. Not one of them\npossesses in his own right anything whatever. On entering there, each\none who was rich makes himself poor. What he has, he gives to all. He\nwho was what is called noble, a gentleman and a lord, is the equal of\nhim who was a peasant. The cell is identical for all. All undergo the\nsame tonsure, wear the same frock, eat the same black bread, sleep on\nthe same straw, die on the same ashes. The same sack on their backs,\nthe same rope around their loins. If the decision has been to go\nbarefoot, all go barefoot. There may be a prince among them; that\nprince is the same shadow as the rest. No titles. Even family names\nhave disappeared. They bear only first names. All are bowed beneath the\nequality of baptismal names. They have dissolved the carnal family, and\nconstituted in their community a spiritual family. They have no other\nrelatives than all men. They succor the poor, they care for the sick.\nThey elect those whom they obey. They call each other “my brother.”\n\n\nYou stop me and exclaim, “But that is the ideal convent!”\n\n\nIt is sufficient that it may be the possible convent, that I should\ntake notice of it.\n\nThence it results that, in the preceding book, I have spoken of a\nconvent with respectful accents. The Middle Ages cast aside, Asia cast\naside, the historical and political question held in reserve, from the\npurely philosophical point of view, outside the requirements of\nmilitant policy, on condition that the monastery shall be absolutely a\nvoluntary matter and shall contain only consenting parties, I shall\nalways consider a cloistered community with a certain attentive, and,\nin some respects, a deferential gravity.\n\nWherever there is a community, there is a commune; where there is a\ncommune, there is right. The monastery is the product of the formula:\nEquality, Fraternity. Oh! how grand is liberty! And what a splendid\ntransfiguration! Liberty suffices to transform the monastery into a\nrepublic.\n\nLet us continue.\n\nBut these men, or these women who are behind these four walls. They\ndress themselves in coarse woollen, they are equals, they call each\nother brothers, that is well; but they do something else?\n\nYes.\n\nWhat?\n\nThey gaze on the darkness, they kneel, and they clasp their hands.\n\nWhat does this signify?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—PRAYER\n\n\nThey pray.\n\nTo whom?\n\nTo God.\n\nTo pray to God,—what is the meaning of these words?\n\nIs there an infinite beyond us? Is that infinite there, inherent,\npermanent; necessarily substantial, since it is infinite; and because,\nif it lacked matter it would be bounded; necessarily intelligent, since\nit is infinite, and because, if it lacked intelligence, it would end\nthere? Does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence, while we\ncan attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence? In other terms,\nis it not the absolute, of which we are only the relative?\n\nAt the same time that there is an infinite without us, is there not an\ninfinite within us? Are not these two infinites (what an alarming\nplural!) superposed, the one upon the other? Is not this second\ninfinite, so to speak, subjacent to the first? Is it not the latter’s\nmirror, reflection, echo, an abyss which is concentric with another\nabyss? Is this second infinity intelligent also? Does it think? Does it\nlove? Does it will? If these two infinities are intelligent, each of\nthem has a will principle, and there is an _I_ in the upper infinity as\nthere is an _I_ in the lower infinity. The _I_ below is the soul; the\n_I_ on high is God.\n\nTo place the infinity here below in contact, by the medium of thought,\nwith the infinity on high, is called praying.\n\nLet us take nothing from the human mind; to suppress is bad. We must\nreform and transform. Certain faculties in man are directed towards the\nUnknown; thought, reverie, prayer. The Unknown is an ocean. What is\nconscience? It is the compass of the Unknown. Thought, reverie,\nprayer,—these are great and mysterious radiations. Let us respect them.\nWhither go these majestic irradiations of the soul? Into the shadow;\nthat is to say, to the light.\n\nThe grandeur of democracy is to disown nothing and to deny nothing of\nhumanity. Close to the right of the man, beside it, at the least, there\nexists the right of the soul.\n\nTo crush fanaticism and to venerate the infinite, such is the law. Let\nus not confine ourselves to prostrating ourselves before the tree of\ncreation, and to the contemplation of its branches full of stars. We\nhave a duty to labor over the human soul, to defend the mystery against\nthe miracle, to adore the incomprehensible and reject the absurd, to\nadmit, as an inexplicable fact, only what is necessary, to purify\nbelief, to remove superstitions from above religion; to clear God of\ncaterpillars.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—THE ABSOLUTE GOODNESS OF PRAYER\n\n\nWith regard to the modes of prayer, all are good, provided that they\nare sincere. Turn your book upside down and be in the infinite.\n\nThere is, as we know, a philosophy which denies the infinite. There is\nalso a philosophy, pathologically classified, which denies the sun;\nthis philosophy is called blindness.\n\nTo erect a sense which we lack into a source of truth, is a fine blind\nman’s self-sufficiency.\n\nThe curious thing is the haughty, superior, and compassionate airs\nwhich this groping philosophy assumes towards the philosophy which\nbeholds God. One fancies he hears a mole crying, “I pity them with\ntheir sun!”\n\n\nThere are, as we know, powerful and illustrious atheists. At bottom,\nled back to the truth by their very force, they are not absolutely sure\nthat they are atheists; it is with them only a question of definition,\nand in any case, if they do not believe in God, being great minds, they\nprove God.\n\nWe salute them as philosophers, while inexorably denouncing their\nphilosophy.\n\nLet us go on.\n\nThe remarkable thing about it is, also, their facility in paying\nthemselves off with words. A metaphysical school of the North,\nimpregnated to some extent with fog, has fancied that it has worked a\nrevolution in human understanding by replacing the word Force with the\nword Will.\n\nTo say: “the plant wills,” instead of: “the plant grows”: this would be\nfecund in results, indeed, if we were to add: “the universe wills.”\nWhy? Because it would come to this: the plant wills, therefore it has\nan _I_; the universe wills, therefore it has a God.\n\nAs for us, who, however, in contradistinction to this school, reject\nnothing _a priori_, a will in the plant, accepted by this school,\nappears to us more difficult to admit than a will in the universe\ndenied by it.\n\nTo deny the will of the infinite, that is to say, God, is impossible on\nany other conditions than a denial of the infinite. We have\ndemonstrated this.\n\nThe negation of the infinite leads straight to nihilism. Everything\nbecomes “a mental conception.”\n\n\nWith nihilism, no discussion is possible; for the nihilist logic doubts\nthe existence of its interlocutor, and is not quite sure that it exists\nitself.\n\nFrom its point of view, it is possible that it may be for itself, only\n“a mental conception.”\n\n\nOnly, it does not perceive that all which it has denied it admits in\nthe lump, simply by the utterance of the word, mind.\n\nIn short, no way is open to the thought by a philosophy which makes all\nend in the monosyllable, No.\n\nTo No there is only one reply, Yes.\n\nNihilism has no point.\n\nThere is no such thing as nothingness. Zero does not exist. Everything\nis something. Nothing is nothing.\n\nMan lives by affirmation even more than by bread.\n\nEven to see and to show does not suffice. Philosophy should be an\nenergy; it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate the\ncondition of man. Socrates should enter into Adam and produce Marcus\nAurelius; in other words, the man of wisdom should be made to emerge\nfrom the man of felicity. Eden should be changed into a Lyceum. Science\nshould be a cordial. To enjoy,—what a sad aim, and what a paltry\nambition! The brute enjoys. To offer thought to the thirst of men, to\ngive them all as an elixir the notion of God, to make conscience and\nscience fraternize in them, to render them just by this mysterious\nconfrontation; such is the function of real philosophy. Morality is a\nblossoming out of truths. Contemplation leads to action. The absolute\nshould be practicable. It is necessary that the ideal should be\nbreathable, drinkable, and eatable to the human mind. It is the ideal\nwhich has the right to say: _Take, this is my body, this is my blood_.\nWisdom is holy communion. It is on this condition that it ceases to be\na sterile love of science and becomes the one and sovereign mode of\nhuman rallying, and that philosophy herself is promoted to religion.\n\nPhilosophy should not be a corbel erected on mystery to gaze upon it at\nits ease, without any other result than that of being convenient to\ncuriosity.\n\nFor our part, adjourning the development of our thought to another\noccasion, we will confine ourselves to saying that we neither\nunderstand man as a point of departure nor progress as an end, without\nthose two forces which are their two motors: faith and love.\n\nProgress is the goal, the ideal is the type.\n\nWhat is this ideal? It is God.\n\nIdeal, absolute, perfection, infinity: identical words.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN BLAME\n\n\nHistory and philosophy have eternal duties, which are, at the same\ntime, simple duties; to combat Caiphas the High-priest, Draco the\nLawgiver, Trimalcion the Legislator, Tiberius the Emperor; this is\nclear, direct, and limpid, and offers no obscurity.\n\nBut the right to live apart, even with its inconveniences and its\nabuses, insists on being stated and taken into account. Cenobitism is a\nhuman problem.\n\nWhen one speaks of convents, those abodes of error, but of innocence,\nof aberration but of good-will, of ignorance but of devotion, of\ntorture but of martyrdom, it always becomes necessary to say either yes\nor no.\n\nA convent is a contradiction. Its object, salvation; its means thereto,\nsacrifice. The convent is supreme egoism having for its result supreme\nabnegation.\n\nTo abdicate with the object of reigning seems to be the device of\nmonasticism.\n\nIn the cloister, one suffers in order to enjoy. One draws a bill of\nexchange on death. One discounts in terrestrial gloom celestial light.\nIn the cloister, hell is accepted in advance as a post obit on\nparadise.\n\nThe taking of the veil or the frock is a suicide paid for with\neternity.\n\nIt does not seem to us, that on such a subject mockery is permissible.\nAll about it is serious, the good as well as the bad.\n\nThe just man frowns, but never smiles with a malicious sneer. We\nunderstand wrath, but not malice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—FAITH, LAW\n\n\nA few words more.\n\nWe blame the church when she is saturated with intrigues, we despise\nthe spiritual which is harsh toward the temporal; but we everywhere\nhonor the thoughtful man.\n\nWe salute the man who kneels.\n\nA faith; this is a necessity for man. Woe to him who believes nothing.\n\nOne is not unoccupied because one is absorbed. There is visible labor\nand invisible labor.\n\nTo contemplate is to labor, to think is to act.\n\nFolded arms toil, clasped hands work. A gaze fixed on heaven is a work.\n\nThales remained motionless for four years. He founded philosophy.\n\nIn our opinion, cenobites are not lazy men, and recluses are not\nidlers.\n\nTo meditate on the Shadow is a serious thing.\n\nWithout invalidating anything that we have just said, we believe that a\nperpetual memory of the tomb is proper for the living. On this point,\nthe priest and the philosopher agree. _We must die_. The Abbé de la\nTrappe replies to Horace.\n\nTo mingle with one’s life a certain presence of the sepulchre,—this is\nthe law of the sage; and it is the law of the ascetic. In this respect,\nthe ascetic and the sage converge. There is a material growth; we admit\nit. There is a moral grandeur; we hold to that. Thoughtless and\nvivacious spirits say:—\n\n“What is the good of those motionless figures on the side of mystery?\nWhat purpose do they serve? What do they do?”\n\n\nAlas! In the presence of the darkness which environs us, and which\nawaits us, in our ignorance of what the immense dispersion will make of\nus, we reply: “There is probably no work more divine than that\nperformed by these souls.” And we add: “There is probably no work which\nis more useful.”\n\n\nThere certainly must be some who pray constantly for those who never\npray at all.\n\nIn our opinion the whole question lies in the amount of thought that is\nmingled with prayer.\n\nLeibnitz praying is grand, Voltaire adoring is fine. _Deo erexit\nVoltaire_.\n\nWe are for religion as against religions.\n\nWe are of the number who believe in the wretchedness of orisons, and\nthe sublimity of prayer.\n\nMoreover, at this minute which we are now traversing,—a minute which\nwill not, fortunately, leave its impress on the nineteenth century,—at\nthis hour, when so many men have low brows and souls but little\nelevated, among so many mortals whose morality consists in enjoyment,\nand who are busied with the brief and misshapen things of matter,\nwhoever exiles himself seems worthy of veneration to us.\n\nThe monastery is a renunciation. Sacrifice wrongly directed is still\nsacrifice. To mistake a grave error for a duty has a grandeur of its\nown.\n\nTaken by itself, and ideally, and in order to examine the truth on all\nsides until all aspects have been impartially exhausted, the monastery,\nthe female convent in particular,—for in our century it is woman who\nsuffers the most, and in this exile of the cloister there is something\nof protestation,—the female convent has incontestably a certain\nmajesty.\n\nThis cloistered existence which is so austere, so depressing, a few of\nwhose features we have just traced, is not life, for it is not liberty;\nit is not the tomb, for it is not plenitude; it is the strange place\nwhence one beholds, as from the crest of a lofty mountain, on one side\nthe abyss where we are, on the other, the abyss whither we shall go; it\nis the narrow and misty frontier separating two worlds, illuminated and\nobscured by both at the same time, where the ray of life which has\nbecome enfeebled is mingled with the vague ray of death; it is the half\nobscurity of the tomb.\n\nWe, who do not believe what these women believe, but who, like them,\nlive by faith,—we have never been able to think without a sort of\ntender and religious terror, without a sort of pity, that is full of\nenvy, of those devoted, trembling and trusting creatures, of these\nhumble and august souls, who dare to dwell on the very brink of the\nmystery, waiting between the world which is closed and heaven which is\nnot yet open, turned towards the light which one cannot see, possessing\nthe sole happiness of thinking that they know where it is, aspiring\ntowards the gulf, and the unknown, their eyes fixed motionless on the\ndarkness, kneeling, bewildered, stupefied, shuddering, half lifted, at\ntimes, by the deep breaths of eternity.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHTH—CEMETERIES TAKE THAT WHICH IS COMMITTED THEM\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—WHICH TREATS OF THE MANNER OF ENTERING A CONVENT\n\n\nIt was into this house that Jean Valjean had, as Fauchelevent expressed\nit, “fallen from the sky.”\n\n\nHe had scaled the wall of the garden which formed the angle of the Rue\nPolonceau. That hymn of the angels which he had heard in the middle of\nthe night, was the nuns chanting matins; that hall, of which he had\ncaught a glimpse in the gloom, was the chapel. That phantom which he\nhad seen stretched on the ground was the sister who was making\nreparation; that bell, the sound of which had so strangely surprised\nhim, was the gardener’s bell attached to the knee of Father\nFauchelevent.\n\nCosette once put to bed, Jean Valjean and Fauchelevent had, as we have\nalready seen, supped on a glass of wine and a bit of cheese before a\ngood, crackling fire; then, the only bed in the hut being occupied by\nCosette, each threw himself on a truss of straw.\n\nBefore he shut his eyes, Jean Valjean said: “I must remain here\nhenceforth.” This remark trotted through Fauchelevent’s head all night\nlong.\n\nTo tell the truth, neither of them slept.\n\nJean Valjean, feeling that he was discovered and that Javert was on his\nscent, understood that he and Cosette were lost if they returned to\nParis. Then the new storm which had just burst upon him had stranded\nhim in this cloister. Jean Valjean had, henceforth, but one thought,—to\nremain there. Now, for an unfortunate man in his position, this convent\nwas both the safest and the most dangerous of places; the most\ndangerous, because, as no men might enter there, if he were discovered,\nit was a flagrant offence, and Jean Valjean would find but one step\nintervening between the convent and prison; the safest, because, if he\ncould manage to get himself accepted there and remain there, who would\never seek him in such a place? To dwell in an impossible place was\nsafety.\n\nOn his side, Fauchelevent was cudgelling his brains. He began by\ndeclaring to himself that he understood nothing of the matter. How had\nM. Madeleine got there, when the walls were what they were? Cloister\nwalls are not to be stepped over. How did he get there with a child?\nOne cannot scale a perpendicular wall with a child in one’s arms. Who\nwas that child? Where did they both come from? Since Fauchelevent had\nlived in the convent, he had heard nothing of M. sur M., and he knew\nnothing of what had taken place there. Father Madeleine had an air\nwhich discouraged questions; and besides, Fauchelevent said to himself:\n“One does not question a saint.” M. Madeleine had preserved all his\nprestige in Fauchelevent’s eyes. Only, from some words which Jean\nValjean had let fall, the gardener thought he could draw the inference\nthat M. Madeleine had probably become bankrupt through the hard times,\nand that he was pursued by his creditors; or that he had compromised\nhimself in some political affair, and was in hiding; which last did not\ndisplease Fauchelevent, who, like many of our peasants of the North,\nhad an old fund of Bonapartism about him. While in hiding, M. Madeleine\nhad selected the convent as a refuge, and it was quite simple that he\nshould wish to remain there. But the inexplicable point, to which\nFauchelevent returned constantly and over which he wearied his brain,\nwas that M. Madeleine should be there, and that he should have that\nlittle girl with him. Fauchelevent saw them, touched them, spoke to\nthem, and still did not believe it possible. The incomprehensible had\njust made its entrance into Fauchelevent’s hut. Fauchelevent groped\nabout amid conjectures, and could see nothing clearly but this: “M.\nMadeleine saved my life.” This certainty alone was sufficient and\ndecided his course. He said to himself: “It is my turn now.” He added\nin his conscience: “M. Madeleine did not stop to deliberate when it was\na question of thrusting himself under the cart for the purpose of\ndragging me out.” He made up his mind to save M. Madeleine.\n\nNevertheless, he put many questions to himself and made himself divers\nreplies: “After what he did for me, would I save him if he were a\nthief? Just the same. If he were an assassin, would I save him? Just\nthe same. Since he is a saint, shall I save him? Just the same.”\n\n\nBut what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent!\nFauchelevent did not recoil in the face of this almost chimerical\nundertaking; this poor peasant of Picardy without any other ladder than\nhis self-devotion, his good will, and a little of that old rustic\ncunning, on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generous\nenterprise, undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister, and\nthe steep escarpments of the rule of Saint-Benoît. Father Fauchelevent\nwas an old man who had been an egoist all his life, and who, towards\nthe end of his days, halt, infirm, with no interest left to him in the\nworld, found it sweet to be grateful, and perceiving a generous action\nto be performed, flung himself upon it like a man, who at the moment\nwhen he is dying, should find close to his hand a glass of good wine\nwhich he had never tasted, and should swallow it with avidity. We may\nadd, that the air which he had breathed for many years in this convent\nhad destroyed all personality in him, and had ended by rendering a good\naction of some kind absolutely necessary to him.\n\nSo he took his resolve: to devote himself to M. Madeleine.\n\nWe have just called him a _poor peasant of Picardy_. That description\nis just, but incomplete. At the point of this story which we have now\nreached, a little of Father Fauchelevent’s physiology becomes useful.\nHe was a peasant, but he had been a notary, which added trickery to his\ncunning, and penetration to his ingenuousness. Having, through various\ncauses, failed in his business, he had descended to the calling of a\ncarter and a laborer. But, in spite of oaths and lashings, which horses\nseem to require, something of the notary had lingered in him. He had\nsome natural wit; he talked good grammar; he conversed, which is a rare\nthing in a village; and the other peasants said of him: “He talks\nalmost like a gentleman with a hat.” Fauchelevent belonged, in fact, to\nthat species, which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last\ncentury qualified as _demi-bourgeois, demi-lout_, and which the\nmetaphors showered by the château upon the thatched cottage ticketed in\nthe pigeon-hole of the plebeian: _rather rustic, rather citified;\npepper and salt_. Fauchelevent, though sorely tried and harshly used by\nfate, worn out, a sort of poor, threadbare old soul, was, nevertheless,\nan impulsive man, and extremely spontaneous in his actions; a precious\nquality which prevents one from ever being wicked. His defects and his\nvices, for he had some, were all superficial; in short, his physiognomy\nwas of the kind which succeeds with an observer. His aged face had none\nof those disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead, which\nsignify malice or stupidity.\n\nAt daybreak, Father Fauchelevent opened his eyes, after having done an\nenormous deal of thinking, and beheld M. Madeleine seated on his truss\nof straw, and watching Cosette’s slumbers. Fauchelevent sat up and\nsaid:—\n\n“Now that you are here, how are you going to contrive to enter?”\n\n\nThis remark summed up the situation and aroused Jean Valjean from his\nreverie.\n\nThe two men took counsel together.\n\n“In the first place,” said Fauchelevent, “you will begin by not setting\nfoot outside of this chamber, either you or the child. One step in the\ngarden and we are done for.”\n\n\n“That is true.”\n\n\n“Monsieur Madeleine,” resumed Fauchelevent, “you have arrived at a very\nauspicious moment, I mean to say a very inauspicious moment; one of the\nladies is very ill. This will prevent them from looking much in our\ndirection. It seems that she is dying. The prayers of the forty hours\nare being said. The whole community is in confusion. That occupies\nthem. The one who is on the point of departure is a saint. In fact, we\nare all saints here; all the difference between them and me is that\nthey say ‘our cell,’ and that I say ‘my cabin.’ The prayers for the\ndying are to be said, and then the prayers for the dead. We shall be at\npeace here for to-day; but I will not answer for to-morrow.”\n\n\n“Still,” observed Jean Valjean, “this cottage is in the niche of the\nwall, it is hidden by a sort of ruin, there are trees, it is not\nvisible from the convent.”\n\n\n“And I add that the nuns never come near it.”\n\n\n“Well?” said Jean Valjean.\n\nThe interrogation mark which accentuated this “well” signified: “it\nseems to me that one may remain concealed here?” It was to this\ninterrogation point that Fauchelevent responded:—\n\n“There are the little girls.”\n\n\n“What little girls?” asked Jean Valjean.\n\nJust as Fauchelevent opened his mouth to explain the words which he had\nuttered, a bell emitted one stroke.\n\n“The nun is dead,” said he. “There is the knell.”\n\n\nAnd he made a sign to Jean Valjean to listen.\n\nThe bell struck a second time.\n\n“It is the knell, Monsieur Madeleine. The bell will continue to strike\nonce a minute for twenty-four hours, until the body is taken from the\nchurch.—You see, they play. At recreation hours it suffices to have a\nball roll aside, to send them all hither, in spite of prohibitions, to\nhunt and rummage for it all about here. Those cherubs are devils.”\n\n\n“Who?” asked Jean Valjean.\n\n“The little girls. You would be very quickly discovered. They would\nshriek: ‘Oh! a man!’ There is no danger to-day. There will be no\nrecreation hour. The day will be entirely devoted to prayers. You hear\nthe bell. As I told you, a stroke each minute. It is the death knell.”\n\n\n“I understand, Father Fauchelevent. There are pupils.”\n\n\nAnd Jean Valjean thought to himself:—\n\n“Here is Cosette’s education already provided.”\n\n\nFauchelevent exclaimed:—\n\n“Pardine! There are little girls indeed! And they would bawl around\nyou! And they would rush off! To be a man here is to have the plague.\nYou see how they fasten a bell to my paw as though I were a wild\nbeast.”\n\n\nJean Valjean fell into more and more profound thought.—“This convent\nwould be our salvation,” he murmured.\n\nThen he raised his voice:—\n\n“Yes, the difficulty is to remain here.”\n\n\n“No,” said Fauchelevent, “the difficulty is to get out.”\n\n\nJean Valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart.\n\n“To get out!”\n\n\n“Yes, Monsieur Madeleine. In order to return here it is first necessary\nto get out.”\n\n\nAnd after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded,\nFauchelevent went on:—\n\n“You must not be found here in this fashion. Whence come you? For me,\nyou fall from heaven, because I know you; but the nuns require one to\nenter by the door.”\n\n\nAll at once they heard a rather complicated pealing from another bell.\n\n“Ah!” said Fauchelevent, “they are ringing up the vocal mothers. They\nare going to the chapter. They always hold a chapter when any one dies.\nShe died at daybreak. People generally do die at daybreak. But cannot\nyou get out by the way in which you entered? Come, I do not ask for the\nsake of questioning you, but how did you get in?”\n\n\nJean Valjean turned pale; the very thought of descending again into\nthat terrible street made him shudder. You make your way out of a\nforest filled with tigers, and once out of it, imagine a friendly\ncounsel that shall advise you to return thither! Jean Valjean pictured\nto himself the whole police force still engaged in swarming in that\nquarter, agents on the watch, sentinels everywhere, frightful fists\nextended towards his collar, Javert at the corner of the intersection\nof the streets perhaps.\n\n“Impossible!” said he. “Father Fauchelevent, say that I fell from the\nsky.”\n\n\n“But I believe it, I believe it,” retorted Fauchelevent. “You have no\nneed to tell me that. The good God must have taken you in his hand for\nthe purpose of getting a good look at you close to, and then dropped\nyou. Only, he meant to place you in a man’s convent; he made a mistake.\nCome, there goes another peal, that is to order the porter to go and\ninform the municipality that the dead-doctor is to come here and view a\ncorpse. All that is the ceremony of dying. These good ladies are not at\nall fond of that visit. A doctor is a man who does not believe in\nanything. He lifts the veil. Sometimes he lifts something else too. How\nquickly they have had the doctor summoned this time! What is the\nmatter? Your little one is still asleep. What is her name?”\n\n\n“Cosette.”\n\n\n“She is your daughter? You are her grandfather, that is?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“It will be easy enough for her to get out of here. I have my service\ndoor which opens on the courtyard. I knock. The porter opens; I have my\nvintage basket on my back, the child is in it, I go out. Father\nFauchelevent goes out with his basket—that is perfectly natural. You\nwill tell the child to keep very quiet. She will be under the cover. I\nwill leave her for whatever time is required with a good old friend, a\nfruit-seller whom I know in the Rue Chemin-Vert, who is deaf, and who\nhas a little bed. I will shout in the fruit-seller’s ear, that she is a\nniece of mine, and that she is to keep her for me until to-morrow. Then\nthe little one will re-enter with you; for I will contrive to have you\nre-enter. It must be done. But how will you manage to get out?”\n\n\nJean Valjean shook his head.\n\n“No one must see me, the whole point lies there, Father Fauchelevent.\nFind some means of getting me out in a basket, under cover, like\nCosette.”\n\n\nFauchelevent scratched the lobe of his ear with the middle finger of\nhis left hand, a sign of serious embarrassment.\n\nA third peal created a diversion.\n\n“That is the dead-doctor taking his departure,” said Fauchelevent. “He\nhas taken a look and said: ‘She is dead, that is well.’ When the doctor\nhas signed the passport for paradise, the undertaker’s company sends a\ncoffin. If it is a mother, the mothers lay her out; if she is a sister,\nthe sisters lay her out. After which, I nail her up. That forms a part\nof my gardener’s duty. A gardener is a bit of a grave-digger. She is\nplaced in a lower hall of the church which communicates with the\nstreet, and into which no man may enter save the doctor of the dead. I\ndon’t count the undertaker’s men and myself as men. It is in that hall\nthat I nail up the coffin. The undertaker’s men come and get it, and\nwhip up, coachman! that’s the way one goes to heaven. They fetch a box\nwith nothing in it, they take it away again with something in it.\nThat’s what a burial is like. _De profundis_.”\n\n\nA horizontal ray of sunshine lightly touched the face of the sleeping\nCosette, who lay with her mouth vaguely open, and had the air of an\nangel drinking in the light. Jean Valjean had fallen to gazing at her.\nHe was no longer listening to Fauchelevent.\n\nThat one is not listened to is no reason for preserving silence. The\ngood old gardener went on tranquilly with his babble:—\n\n“The grave is dug in the Vaugirard cemetery. They declare that they are\ngoing to suppress that Vaugirard cemetery. It is an ancient cemetery\nwhich is outside the regulations, which has no uniform, and which is\ngoing to retire. It is a shame, for it is convenient. I have a friend\nthere, Father Mestienne, the grave-digger. The nuns here possess one\nprivilege, it is to be taken to that cemetery at nightfall. There is a\nspecial permission from the Prefecture on their behalf. But how many\nevents have happened since yesterday! Mother Crucifixion is dead, and\nFather Madeleine—”\n\n\n“Is buried,” said Jean Valjean, smiling sadly.\n\nFauchelevent caught the word.\n\n“Goodness! if you were here for good, it would be a real burial.”\n\n\nA fourth peal burst out. Fauchelevent hastily detached the belled\nknee-cap from its nail and buckled it on his knee again.\n\n“This time it is for me. The Mother Prioress wants me. Good, now I am\npricking myself on the tongue of my buckle. Monsieur Madeleine, don’t\nstir from here, and wait for me. Something new has come up. If you are\nhungry, there is wine, bread and cheese.”\n\n\nAnd he hastened out of the hut, crying: “Coming! coming!”\n\n\nJean Valjean watched him hurrying across the garden as fast as his\ncrooked leg would permit, casting a sidelong glance by the way on his\nmelon patch.\n\nLess than ten minutes later, Father Fauchelevent, whose bell put the\nnuns in his road to flight, tapped gently at a door, and a gentle voice\nreplied: _“Forever! Forever!” _ that is to say: _“Enter.” _\n\nThe door was the one leading to the parlor reserved for seeing the\ngardener on business. This parlor adjoined the chapter hall. The\nprioress, seated on the only chair in the parlor, was waiting for\nFauchelevent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—FAUCHELEVENT IN THE PRESENCE OF A DIFFICULTY\n\n\nIt is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions,\nnotably priests and nuns, to wear a grave and agitated air on critical\noccasions. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, this double form of\npreoccupation was imprinted on the countenance of the prioress, who was\nthat wise and charming Mademoiselle de Blemeur, Mother Innocente, who\nwas ordinarily cheerful.\n\nThe gardener made a timid bow, and remained at the door of the cell.\nThe prioress, who was telling her beads, raised her eyes and said:—\n\n“Ah! it is you, Father Fauvent.”\n\n\nThis abbreviation had been adopted in the convent.\n\nFauchelevent bowed again.\n\n“Father Fauvent, I have sent for you.”\n\n\n“Here I am, reverend Mother.”\n\n\n“I have something to say to you.”\n\n\n“And so have I,” said Fauchelevent with a boldness which caused him\ninward terror, “I have something to say to the very reverend Mother.”\n\n\nThe prioress stared at him.\n\n“Ah! you have a communication to make to me.”\n\n\n“A request.”\n\n\n“Very well, speak.”\n\n\nGoodman Fauchelevent, the ex-notary, belonged to the category of\npeasants who have assurance. A certain clever ignorance constitutes a\nforce; you do not distrust it, and you are caught by it. Fauchelevent\nhad been a success during the something more than two years which he\nhad passed in the convent. Always solitary and busied about his\ngardening, he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity. As\nhe was at a distance from all those veiled women passing to and fro, he\nsaw before him only an agitation of shadows. By dint of attention and\nsharpness he had succeeded in clothing all those phantoms with flesh,\nand those corpses were alive for him. He was like a deaf man whose\nsight grows keener, and like a blind man whose hearing becomes more\nacute. He had applied himself to riddling out the significance of the\ndifferent peals, and he had succeeded, so that this taciturn and\nenigmatical cloister possessed no secrets for him; the sphinx babbled\nall her secrets in his ear. Fauchelevent knew all and concealed all;\nthat constituted his art. The whole convent thought him stupid. A great\nmerit in religion. The vocal mothers made much of Fauchelevent. He was\na curious mute. He inspired confidence. Moreover, he was regular, and\nnever went out except for well-demonstrated requirements of the orchard\nand vegetable garden. This discretion of conduct had inured to his\ncredit. Nonetheless, he had set two men to chattering: the porter, in\nthe convent, and he knew the singularities of their parlor, and the\ngrave-digger, at the cemetery, and he was acquainted with the\npeculiarities of their sepulture; in this way, he possessed a double\nlight on the subject of these nuns, one as to their life, the other as\nto their death. But he did not abuse his knowledge. The congregation\nthought a great deal of him. Old, lame, blind to everything, probably a\nlittle deaf into the bargain,—what qualities! They would have found it\ndifficult to replace him.\n\nThe goodman, with the assurance of a person who feels that he is\nappreciated, entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic\nharangue to the reverend prioress. He talked a long time about his age,\nhis infirmities, the surcharge of years counting double for him\nhenceforth, of the increasing demands of his work, of the great size of\nthe garden, of nights which must be passed, like the last, for\ninstance, when he had been obliged to put straw mats over the melon\nbeds, because of the moon, and he wound up as follows: “That he had a\nbrother”—(the prioress made a movement),—“a brother no longer young”—(a\nsecond movement on the part of the prioress, but one expressive of\nreassurance),—“that, if he might be permitted, this brother would come\nand live with him and help him, that he was an excellent gardener, that\nthe community would receive from him good service, better than his own;\nthat, otherwise, if his brother were not admitted, as he, the elder,\nfelt that his health was broken and that he was insufficient for the\nwork, he should be obliged, greatly to his regret, to go away; and that\nhis brother had a little daughter whom he would bring with him, who\nmight be reared for God in the house, and who might, who knows, become\na nun some day.”\n\n\nWhen he had finished speaking, the prioress stayed the slipping of her\nrosary between her fingers, and said to him:—\n\n“Could you procure a stout iron bar between now and this evening?”\n\n\n“For what purpose?”\n\n\n“To serve as a lever.”\n\n\n“Yes, reverend Mother,” replied Fauchelevent.\n\nThe prioress, without adding a word, rose and entered the adjoining\nroom, which was the hall of the chapter, and where the vocal mothers\nwere probably assembled. Fauchelevent was left alone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—MOTHER INNOCENTE\n\n\nAbout a quarter of an hour elapsed. The prioress returned and seated\nherself once more on her chair.\n\nThe two interlocutors seemed preoccupied. We will present a\nstenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued, to the best of\nour ability.\n\n“Father Fauvent!”\n\n\n“Reverend Mother!”\n\n\n“Do you know the chapel?”\n\n\n“I have a little cage there, where I hear the mass and the offices.”\n\n\n“And you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties?”\n\n\n“Two or three times.”\n\n\n“There is a stone to be raised.”\n\n\n“Heavy?”\n\n\n“The slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar.”\n\n\n“The slab which closes the vault?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“It would be a good thing to have two men for it.”\n\n\n“Mother Ascension, who is as strong as a man, will help you.”\n\n\n“A woman is never a man.”\n\n\n“We have only a woman here to help you. Each one does what he can.\nBecause Dom Mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of Saint\nBernard, while Merlonus Horstius only gives three hundred and\nsixty-seven, I do not despise Merlonus Horstius.”\n\n\n“Neither do I.”\n\n\n“Merit consists in working according to one’s strength. A cloister is\nnot a dock-yard.”\n\n\n“And a woman is not a man. But my brother is the strong one, though!”\n\n\n“And can you get a lever?”\n\n\n“That is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door.”\n\n\n“There is a ring in the stone.”\n\n\n“I will put the lever through it.”\n\n\n“And the stone is so arranged that it swings on a pivot.”\n\n\n“That is good, reverend Mother. I will open the vault.”\n\n\n“And the four Mother Precentors will help you.”\n\n\n“And when the vault is open?”\n\n\n“It must be closed again.”\n\n\n“Will that be all?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“Give me your orders, very reverend Mother.”\n\n\n“Fauvent, we have confidence in you.”\n\n\n“I am here to do anything you wish.”\n\n\n“And to hold your peace about everything!”\n\n\n“Yes, reverend Mother.”\n\n\n“When the vault is open—”\n\n\n“I will close it again.”\n\n\n“But before that—”\n\n\n“What, reverend Mother?”\n\n\n“Something must be lowered into it.”\n\n\nA silence ensued. The prioress, after a pout of the under lip which\nresembled hesitation, broke it.\n\n“Father Fauvent!”\n\n\n“Reverend Mother!”\n\n\n“You know that a mother died this morning?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“Did you not hear the bell?”\n\n\n“Nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden.”\n\n\n“Really?”\n\n\n“I can hardly distinguish my own signal.”\n\n\n“She died at daybreak.”\n\n\n“And then, the wind did not blow in my direction this morning.”\n\n\n“It was Mother Crucifixion. A blessed woman.”\n\n\nThe prioress paused, moved her lips, as though in mental prayer, and\nresumed:—\n\n“Three years ago, Madame de Béthune, a Jansenist, turned orthodox,\nmerely from having seen Mother Crucifixion at prayer.”\n\n\n“Ah! yes, now I hear the knell, reverend Mother.”\n\n\n“The mothers have taken her to the dead-room, which opens on the\nchurch.”\n\n\n“I know.”\n\n\n“No other man than you can or must enter that chamber. See to that. A\nfine sight it would be, to see a man enter the dead-room!”\n\n\n“More often!”\n\n\n“Hey?”\n\n\n“More often!”\n\n\n“What do you say?”\n\n\n“I say more often.”\n\n\n“More often than what?”\n\n\n“Reverend Mother, I did not say more often than what, I said more\noften.”\n\n\n“I don’t understand you. Why do you say more often?”\n\n\n“In order to speak like you, reverend Mother.”\n\n\n“But I did not say ‘more often.’”\n\n\nAt that moment, nine o’clock struck.\n\n“At nine o’clock in the morning and at all hours, praised and adored be\nthe most Holy Sacrament of the altar,” said the prioress.\n\n“Amen,” said Fauchelevent.\n\nThe clock struck opportunely. It cut “more often” short. It is\nprobable, that had it not been for this, the prioress and Fauchelevent\nwould never have unravelled that skein.\n\nFauchelevent mopped his forehead.\n\nThe prioress indulged in another little inward murmur, probably sacred,\nthen raised her voice:—\n\n“In her lifetime, Mother Crucifixion made converts; after her death,\nshe will perform miracles.”\n\n\n“She will!” replied Father Fauchelevent, falling into step, and\nstriving not to flinch again.\n\n“Father Fauvent, the community has been blessed in Mother Crucifixion.\nNo doubt, it is not granted to every one to die, like Cardinal de\nBérulle, while saying the holy mass, and to breathe forth their souls\nto God, while pronouncing these words: _Hanc igitur oblationem_. But\nwithout attaining to such happiness, Mother Crucifixion’s death was\nvery precious. She retained her consciousness to the very last moment.\nShe spoke to us, then she spoke to the angels. She gave us her last\ncommands. If you had a little more faith, and if you could have been in\nher cell, she would have cured your leg merely by touching it. She\nsmiled. We felt that she was regaining her life in God. There was\nsomething of paradise in that death.”\n\n\nFauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing.\n\n“Amen,” said he.\n\n“Father Fauvent, what the dead wish must be done.”\n\n\nThe prioress took off several beads of her chaplet. Fauchelevent held\nhis peace.\n\nShe went on:—\n\n“I have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in Our\nLord, who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life, and\nwho bear wonderful fruit.”\n\n\n“Reverend Mother, you can hear the knell much better here than in the\ngarden.”\n\n\n“Besides, she is more than a dead woman, she is a saint.”\n\n\n“Like yourself, reverend Mother.”\n\n\n“She slept in her coffin for twenty years, by express permission of our\nHoly Father, Pius VII.—”\n\n\n“The one who crowned the Emp—Buonaparte.”\n\n\nFor a clever man like Fauchelevent, this allusion was an awkward one.\nFortunately, the prioress, completely absorbed in her own thoughts, did\nnot hear it. She continued:—\n\n“Father Fauvent?”\n\n\n“Reverend Mother?”\n\n\n“Saint Didorus, Archbishop of Cappadocia, desired that this single word\nmight be inscribed on his tomb: _Acarus_, which signifies, a worm of\nthe earth; this was done. Is this true?”\n\n\n“Yes, reverend Mother.”\n\n\n“The blessed Mezzocane, Abbot of Aquila, wished to be buried beneath\nthe gallows; this was done.”\n\n\n“That is true.”\n\n\n“Saint Terentius, Bishop of Port, where the mouth of the Tiber empties\ninto the sea, requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign\nwhich was placed on the graves of parricides, in the hope that\npassers-by would spit on his tomb. This was done. The dead must be\nobeyed.”\n\n\n“So be it.”\n\n\n“The body of Bernard Guidonis, born in France near Roche-Abeille, was,\nas he had ordered, and in spite of the king of Castile, borne to the\nchurch of the Dominicans in Limoges, although Bernard Guidonis was\nBishop of Tuy in Spain. Can the contrary be affirmed?”\n\n\n“For that matter, no, reverend Mother.”\n\n\n“The fact is attested by Plantavit de la Fosse.”\n\n\nSeveral beads of the chaplet were told off, still in silence. The\nprioress resumed:—\n\n“Father Fauvent, Mother Crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in\nwhich she has slept for the last twenty years.”\n\n\n“That is just.”\n\n\n“It is a continuation of her slumber.”\n\n\n“So I shall have to nail up that coffin?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“And we are to reject the undertaker’s coffin?”\n\n\n“Precisely.”\n\n\n“I am at the orders of the very reverend community.”\n\n\n“The four Mother Precentors will assist you.”\n\n\n“In nailing up the coffin? I do not need them.”\n\n\n“No. In lowering the coffin.”\n\n\n“Where?”\n\n\n“Into the vault.”\n\n\n“What vault?”\n\n\n“Under the altar.”\n\n\nFauchelevent started.\n\n“The vault under the altar?”\n\n\n“Under the altar.”\n\n\n“But—”\n\n\n“You will have an iron bar.”\n\n\n“Yes, but—”\n\n\n“You will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring.”\n\n\n“But—”\n\n\n“The dead must be obeyed. To be buried in the vault under the altar of\nthe chapel, not to go to profane earth; to remain there in death where\nshe prayed while living; such was the last wish of Mother Crucifixion.\nShe asked it of us; that is to say, commanded us.”\n\n\n“But it is forbidden.”\n\n\n“Forbidden by men, enjoined by God.”\n\n\n“What if it became known?”\n\n\n“We have confidence in you.”\n\n\n“Oh! I am a stone in your walls.”\n\n\n“The chapter assembled. The vocal mothers, whom I have just consulted\nagain, and who are now deliberating, have decided that Mother\nCrucifixion shall be buried, according to her wish, in her own coffin,\nunder our altar. Think, Father Fauvent, if she were to work miracles\nhere! What a glory of God for the community! And miracles issue from\ntombs.”\n\n\n“But, reverend Mother, if the agent of the sanitary commission—”\n\n\n“Saint Benoît II., in the matter of sepulture, resisted Constantine\nPogonatus.”\n\n\n“But the commissary of police—”\n\n\n“Chonodemaire, one of the seven German kings who entered among the\nGauls under the Empire of Constantius, expressly recognized the right\nof nuns to be buried in religion, that is to say, beneath the altar.”\n\n\n“But the inspector from the Prefecture—”\n\n\n“The world is nothing in the presence of the cross. Martin, the\neleventh general of the Carthusians, gave to his order this device:\n_Stat crux dum volvitur orbis_.”\n\n\n“Amen,” said Fauchelevent, who imperturbably extricated himself in this\nmanner from the dilemma, whenever he heard Latin.\n\nAny audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long. On\nthe day when the rhetorician Gymnastoras left his prison, bearing in\nhis body many dilemmas and numerous syllogisms which had struck in, he\nhalted in front of the first tree which he came to, harangued it and\nmade very great efforts to convince it. The prioress, who was usually\nsubjected to the barrier of silence, and whose reservoir was overfull,\nrose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away:—\n\n“I have on my right Benoît and on my left Bernard. Who was Bernard? The\nfirst abbot of Clairvaux. Fontaines in Burgundy is a country that is\nblest because it gave him birth. His father was named Técelin, and his\nmother Alèthe. He began at Cîteaux, to end in Clairvaux; he was\nordained abbot by the bishop of Châlon-sur-Saône, Guillaume de\nChampeaux; he had seven hundred novices, and founded a hundred and\nsixty monasteries; he overthrew Abeilard at the council of Sens in\n1140, and Pierre de Bruys and Henry his disciple, and another sort of\nerring spirits who were called the Apostolics; he confounded Arnauld de\nBrescia, darted lightning at the monk Raoul, the murderer of the Jews,\ndominated the council of Reims in 1148, caused the condemnation of\nGilbert de Poréa, Bishop of Poitiers, caused the condemnation of Éon de\nl‘Étoile, arranged the disputes of princes, enlightened King Louis the\nYoung, advised Pope Eugene III., regulated the Temple, preached the\ncrusade, performed two hundred and fifty miracles during his lifetime,\nand as many as thirty-nine in one day. Who was Benoît? He was the\npatriarch of Mont-Cassin; he was the second founder of the Sainteté\nClaustrale, he was the Basil of the West. His order has produced forty\npopes, two hundred cardinals, fifty patriarchs, sixteen hundred\narchbishops, four thousand six hundred bishops, four emperors, twelve\nempresses, forty-six kings, forty-one queens, three thousand six\nhundred canonized saints, and has been in existence for fourteen\nhundred years. On one side Saint Bernard, on the other the agent of the\nsanitary department! On one side Saint Benoît, on the other the\ninspector of public ways! The state, the road commissioners, the public\nundertaker, regulations, the administration, what do we know of all\nthat? There is not a chance passer-by who would not be indignant to see\nhow we are treated. We have not even the right to give our dust to\nJesus Christ! Your sanitary department is a revolutionary invention.\nGod subordinated to the commissary of police; such is the age. Silence,\nFauvent!”\n\n\nFauchelevent was but ill at ease under this shower bath. The prioress\ncontinued:—\n\n“No one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture. Only fanatics\nand those in error deny it. We live in times of terrible confusion. We\ndo not know that which it is necessary to know, and we know that which\nwe should ignore. We are ignorant and impious. In this age there exist\npeople who do not distinguish between the very great Saint Bernard and\nthe Saint Bernard denominated of the poor Catholics, a certain good\necclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century. Others are so\nblasphemous as to compare the scaffold of Louis XVI. to the cross of\nJesus Christ. Louis XVI. was merely a king. Let us beware of God! There\nis no longer just nor unjust. The name of Voltaire is known, but not\nthe name of César de Bus. Nevertheless, César de Bus is a man of\nblessed memory, and Voltaire one of unblessed memory. The last\narch-bishop, the Cardinal de Périgord, did not even know that Charles\nde Gondren succeeded to Berulle, and François Bourgoin to Gondren, and\nJean-François Senault to Bourgoin, and Father Sainte-Marthe to\nJean-François Senault. The name of Father Coton is known, not because\nhe was one of the three who urged the foundation of the Oratorie, but\nbecause he furnished Henri IV., the Huguenot king, with the material\nfor an oath. That which pleases people of the world in Saint François\nde Sales, is that he cheated at play. And then, religion is attacked.\nWhy? Because there have been bad priests, because Sagittaire, Bishop of\nGap, was the brother of Salone, Bishop of Embrun, and because both of\nthem followed Mommol. What has that to do with the question? Does that\nprevent Martin de Tours from being a saint, and giving half of his\ncloak to a beggar? They persecute the saints. They shut their eyes to\nthe truth. Darkness is the rule. The most ferocious beasts are beasts\nwhich are blind. No one thinks of hell as a reality. Oh! how wicked\npeople are! By order of the king signifies to-day, by order of the\nrevolution. One no longer knows what is due to the living or to the\ndead. A holy death is prohibited. Burial is a civil matter. This is\nhorrible. Saint Leo II. wrote two special letters, one to Pierre\nNotaire, the other to the king of the Visigoths, for the purpose of\ncombating and rejecting, in questions touching the dead, the authority\nof the exarch and the supremacy of the Emperor. Gauthier, Bishop of\nChâlons, held his own in this matter against Otho, Duke of Burgundy.\nThe ancient magistracy agreed with him. In former times we had voices\nin the chapter, even on matters of the day. The Abbot of Cîteaux, the\ngeneral of the order, was councillor by right of birth to the\nparliament of Burgundy. We do what we please with our dead. Is not the\nbody of Saint Benoît himself in France, in the abbey of Fleury, called\nSaint Benoît-sur-Loire, although he died in Italy at Mont-Cassin, on\nSaturday, the 21st of the month of March, of the year 543? All this is\nincontestable. I abhor psalm-singers, I hate priors, I execrate\nheretics, but I should detest yet more any one who should maintain the\ncontrary. One has only to read Arnoul Wion, Gabriel Bucelin, Trithemus,\nMaurolics, and Dom Luc d’Achery.”\n\n\nThe prioress took breath, then turned to Fauchelevent.\n\n“Is it settled, Father Fauvent?”\n\n\n“It is settled, reverend Mother.”\n\n\n“We may depend on you?”\n\n\n“I will obey.”\n\n\n“That is well.”\n\n\n“I am entirely devoted to the convent.”\n\n\n“That is understood. You will close the coffin. The sisters will carry\nit to the chapel. The office for the dead will then be said. Then we\nshall return to the cloister. Between eleven o’clock and midnight, you\nwill come with your iron bar. All will be done in the most profound\nsecrecy. There will be in the chapel only the four Mother Precentors,\nMother Ascension and yourself.”\n\n\n“And the sister at the post?”\n\n\n“She will not turn round.”\n\n\n“But she will hear.”\n\n\n“She will not listen. Besides, what the cloister knows the world learns\nnot.”\n\n\nA pause ensued. The prioress went on:—\n\n“You will remove your bell. It is not necessary that the sister at the\npost should perceive your presence.”\n\n\n“Reverend Mother?”\n\n\n“What, Father Fauvent?”\n\n\n“Has the doctor for the dead paid his visit?”\n\n\n“He will pay it at four o’clock to-day. The peal which orders the\ndoctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung. But you do\nnot understand any of the peals?”\n\n\n“I pay no attention to any but my own.”\n\n\n“That is well, Father Fauvent.”\n\n\n“Reverend Mother, a lever at least six feet long will be required.”\n\n\n“Where will you obtain it?”\n\n\n“Where gratings are not lacking, iron bars are not lacking. I have my\nheap of old iron at the bottom of the garden.”\n\n\n“About three-quarters of an hour before midnight; do not forget.”\n\n\n“Reverend Mother?”\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“If you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort, my brother is\nthe strong man for you. A perfect Turk!”\n\n\n“You will do it as speedily as possible.”\n\n\n“I cannot work very fast. I am infirm; that is why I require an\nassistant. I limp.”\n\n\n“To limp is no sin, and perhaps it is a blessing. The Emperor Henry\nII., who combated Antipope Gregory and re-established Benoît VIII., has\ntwo surnames, the Saint and the Lame.”\n\n\n“Two surtouts are a good thing,” murmured Fauchelevent, who really was\na little hard of hearing.\n\n“Now that I think of it, Father Fauvent, let us give a whole hour to\nit. That is not too much. Be near the principal altar, with your iron\nbar, at eleven o’clock. The office begins at midnight. Everything must\nhave been completed a good quarter of an hour before that.”\n\n\n“I will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community. These are\nmy orders. I am to nail up the coffin. At eleven o’clock exactly, I am\nto be in the chapel. The Mother Precentors will be there. Mother\nAscension will be there. Two men would be better. However, never mind!\nI shall have my lever. We will open the vault, we will lower the\ncoffin, and we will close the vault again. After which, there will be\nno trace of anything. The government will have no suspicion. Thus all\nhas been arranged, reverend Mother?”\n\n\n“No!”\n\n\n“What else remains?”\n\n\n“The empty coffin remains.”\n\n\nThis produced a pause. Fauchelevent meditated. The prioress meditated.\n\n“What is to be done with that coffin, Father Fauvent?”\n\n\n“It will be given to the earth.”\n\n\n“Empty?”\n\n\nAnother silence. Fauchelevent made, with his left hand, that sort of a\ngesture which dismisses a troublesome subject.\n\n“Reverend Mother, I am the one who is to nail up the coffin in the\nbasement of the church, and no one can enter there but myself, and I\nwill cover the coffin with the pall.”\n\n\n“Yes, but the bearers, when they place it in the hearse and lower it\ninto the grave, will be sure to feel that there is nothing in it.”\n\n\n“Ah! the de—!” exclaimed Fauchelevent.\n\nThe prioress began to make the sign of the cross, and looked fixedly at\nthe gardener. The _vil_ stuck fast in his throat.\n\nHe made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath.\n\n“I will put earth in the coffin, reverend Mother. That will produce the\neffect of a corpse.”\n\n\n“You are right. Earth, that is the same thing as man. So you will\nmanage the empty coffin?”\n\n\n“I will make that my special business.”\n\n\nThe prioress’s face, up to that moment troubled and clouded, grew\nserene once more. She made the sign of a superior dismissing an\ninferior to him. Fauchelevent went towards the door. As he was on the\npoint of passing out, the prioress raised her voice gently:—\n\n“I am pleased with you, Father Fauvent; bring your brother to me\nto-morrow, after the burial, and tell him to fetch his daughter.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—IN WHICH JEAN VALJEAN HAS QUITE THE AIR OF HAVING READ\nAUSTIN CASTILLEJO\n\n\nThe strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one-eyed\nman; they do not reach their goal very promptly. Moreover, Fauchelevent\nwas in a dilemma. He took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to his\ncottage in the garden. Cosette had waked up. Jean Valjean had placed\nher near the fire. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, Jean\nValjean was pointing out to her the vintner’s basket on the wall, and\nsaying to her, “Listen attentively to me, my little Cosette. We must go\naway from this house, but we shall return to it, and we shall be very\nhappy here. The good man who lives here is going to carry you off on\nhis back in that. You will wait for me at a lady’s house. I shall come\nto fetch you. Obey, and say nothing, above all things, unless you want\nMadame Thénardier to get you again!”\n\n\nCosette nodded gravely.\n\nJean Valjean turned round at the noise made by Fauchelevent opening the\ndoor.\n\n“Well?”\n\n\n“Everything is arranged, and nothing is,” said Fauchelevent. “I have\npermission to bring you in; but before bringing you in you must be got\nout. That’s where the difficulty lies. It is easy enough with the\nchild.”\n\n\n“You will carry her out?”\n\n\n“And she will hold her tongue?”\n\n\n“I answer for that.”\n\n\n“But you, Father Madeleine?”\n\n\nAnd, after a silence, fraught with anxiety, Fauchelevent exclaimed:—\n\n“Why, get out as you came in!”\n\n\nJean Valjean, as in the first instance, contented himself with saying,\n“Impossible.”\n\n\nFauchelevent grumbled, more to himself than to Jean Valjean:—\n\n“There is another thing which bothers me. I have said that I would put\nearth in it. When I come to think it over, the earth instead of the\ncorpse will not seem like the real thing, it won’t do, it will get\ndisplaced, it will move about. The men will bear it. You understand,\nFather Madeleine, the government will notice it.”\n\n\nJean Valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was\nraving.\n\nFauchelevent went on:—\n\n“How the de—uce are you going to get out? It must all be done by\nto-morrow morning. It is to-morrow that I am to bring you in. The\nprioress expects you.”\n\n\nThen he explained to Jean Valjean that this was his recompense for a\nservice which he, Fauchelevent, was to render to the community. That it\nfell among his duties to take part in their burials, that he nailed up\nthe coffins and helped the grave-digger at the cemetery. That the nun\nwho had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin\nwhich had served her for a bed, and interred in the vault under the\naltar of the chapel. That the police regulations forbade this, but that\nshe was one of those dead to whom nothing is refused. That the prioress\nand the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased. That\nit was so much the worse for the government. That he, Fauchelevent, was\nto nail up the coffin in the cell, raise the stone in the chapel, and\nlower the corpse into the vault. And that, by way of thanks, the\nprioress was to admit his brother to the house as a gardener, and his\nniece as a pupil. That his brother was M. Madeleine, and that his niece\nwas Cosette. That the prioress had told him to bring his brother on the\nfollowing evening, after the counterfeit interment in the cemetery. But\nthat he could not bring M. Madeleine in from the outside if M.\nMadeleine was not outside. That that was the first problem. And then,\nthat there was another: the empty coffin.\n\n“What is that empty coffin?” asked Jean Valjean.\n\nFauchelevent replied:—\n\n“The coffin of the administration.”\n\n\n“What coffin? What administration?”\n\n\n“A nun dies. The municipal doctor comes and says, ‘A nun has died.’ The\ngovernment sends a coffin. The next day it sends a hearse and\nundertaker’s men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery. The\nundertaker’s men will come and lift the coffin; there will be nothing\nin it.”\n\n\n“Put something in it.”\n\n\n“A corpse? I have none.”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“What then?”\n\n\n“A living person.”\n\n\n“What person?”\n\n\n“Me!” said Jean Valjean.\n\nFauchelevent, who was seated, sprang up as though a bomb had burst\nunder his chair.\n\n“You!”\n\n\n“Why not?”\n\n\nJean Valjean gave way to one of those rare smiles which lighted up his\nface like a flash from heaven in the winter.\n\n“You know, Fauchelevent, what you have said: ‘Mother Crucifixion is\ndead.’ and I add: ‘and Father Madeleine is buried.’”\n\n\n“Ah! good, you can laugh, you are not speaking seriously.”\n\n\n“Very seriously, I must get out of this place.”\n\n\n“Certainly.”\n\n\n“l have told you to find a basket, and a cover for me also.”\n\n\n“Well?”\n\n\n“The basket will be of pine, and the cover a black cloth.”\n\n\n“In the first place, it will be a white cloth. Nuns are buried in\nwhite.”\n\n\n“Let it be a white cloth, then.”\n\n\n“You are not like other men, Father Madeleine.”\n\n\nTo behold such devices, which are nothing else than the savage and\ndaring inventions of the galleys, spring forth from the peaceable\nthings which surrounded him, and mingle with what he called the “petty\ncourse of life in the convent,” caused Fauchelevent as much amazement\nas a gull fishing in the gutter of the Rue Saint-Denis would inspire in\na passer-by.\n\nJean Valjean went on:—\n\n“The problem is to get out of here without being seen. This offers the\nmeans. But give me some information, in the first place. How is it\nmanaged? Where is this coffin?”\n\n\n“The empty one?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Downstairs, in what is called the dead-room. It stands on two\ntrestles, under the pall.”\n\n\n“How long is the coffin?”\n\n\n“Six feet.”\n\n\n“What is this dead-room?”\n\n\n“It is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening\non the garden, which is closed on the outside by a shutter, and two\ndoors; one leads into the convent, the other into the church.”\n\n\n“What church?”\n\n\n“The church in the street, the church which any one can enter.”\n\n\n“Have you the keys to those two doors?”\n\n\n“No; I have the key to the door which communicates with the convent;\nthe porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church.”\n\n\n“When does the porter open that door?”\n\n\n“Only to allow the undertaker’s men to enter, when they come to get the\ncoffin. When the coffin has been taken out, the door is closed again.”\n\n\n“Who nails up the coffin?”\n\n\n“I do.”\n\n\n“Who spreads the pall over it?”\n\n\n“I do.”\n\n\n“Are you alone?”\n\n\n“Not another man, except the police doctor, can enter the dead-room.\nThat is even written on the wall.”\n\n\n“Could you hide me in that room to-night when every one is asleep?”\n\n\n“No. But I could hide you in a small, dark nook which opens on the\ndead-room, where I keep my tools to use for burials, and of which I\nhave the key.”\n\n\n“At what time will the hearse come for the coffin to-morrow?”\n\n\n“About three o’clock in the afternoon. The burial will take place at\nthe Vaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall. It is not very near.”\n\n\n“I will remain concealed in your tool-closet all night and all the\nmorning. And how about food? I shall be hungry.”\n\n\n“I will bring you something.”\n\n\n“You can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o’clock.”\n\n\nFauchelevent recoiled and cracked his finger-joints.\n\n“But that is impossible!”\n\n\n“Bah! Impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank?”\n\n\nWhat seemed unprecedented to Fauchelevent was, we repeat, a simple\nmatter to Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean had been in worse straits than\nthis. Any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract\nhimself to fit the diameter of the escape. The prisoner is subject to\nflight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or kills him.\nAn escape is a cure. What does not a man undergo for the sake of a\ncure? To have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale\nof goods, to live for a long time in a box, to find air where there is\nnone, to economize his breath for hours, to know how to stifle without\ndying—this was one of Jean Valjean’s gloomy talents.\n\nMoreover, a coffin containing a living being,—that convict’s\nexpedient,—is also an imperial expedient. If we are to credit the monk\nAustin Castillejo, this was the means employed by Charles the Fifth,\ndesirous of seeing the Plombes for the last time after his abdication.\n\nHe had her brought into and carried out of the monastery of Saint-Yuste\nin this manner.\n\nFauchelevent, who had recovered himself a little, exclaimed:—\n\n“But how will you manage to breathe?”\n\n\n“I will breathe.”\n\n\n“In that box! The mere thought of it suffocates me.”\n\n\n“You surely must have a gimlet, you will make a few holes here and\nthere, around my mouth, and you will nail the top plank on loosely.”\n\n\n“Good! And what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze?”\n\n\n“A man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze.”\n\n\nAnd Jean Valjean added:—\n\n“Father Fauchelevent, we must come to a decision: I must either be\ncaught here, or accept this escape through the hearse.”\n\n\nEvery one has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing and\nlounging between the two leaves of a half-shut door. Who is there who\nhas not said to a cat, “Do come in!” There are men who, when an\nincident stands half-open before them, have the same tendency to halt\nin indecision between two resolutions, at the risk of getting crushed\nthrough the abrupt closing of the adventure by fate. The over-prudent,\ncats as they are, and because they are cats, sometimes incur more\ndanger than the audacious. Fauchelevent was of this hesitating nature.\nBut Jean Valjean’s coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself. He\ngrumbled:—\n\n“Well, since there is no other means.”\n\n\nJean Valjean resumed:—\n\n“The only thing which troubles me is what will take place at the\ncemetery.”\n\n\n“That is the very point that is not troublesome,” exclaimed\nFauchelevent. “If you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right, I\nam sure of getting you out of the grave. The grave-digger is a\ndrunkard, and a friend of mine. He is Father Mestienne. An old fellow\nof the old school. The grave-digger puts the corpses in the grave, and\nI put the grave-digger in my pocket. I will tell you what will take\nplace. They will arrive a little before dusk, three-quarters of an hour\nbefore the gates of the cemetery are closed. The hearse will drive\ndirectly up to the grave. I shall follow; that is my business. I shall\nhave a hammer, a chisel, and some pincers in my pocket. The hearse\nhalts, the undertaker’s men knot a rope around your coffin and lower\nyou down. The priest says the prayers, makes the sign of the cross,\nsprinkles the holy water, and takes his departure. I am left alone with\nFather Mestienne. He is my friend, I tell you. One of two things will\nhappen, he will either be sober, or he will not be sober. If he is not\ndrunk, I shall say to him: ‘Come and drink a bout while the _Bon Coing_\n[the Good Quince] is open.’ I carry him off, I get him drunk,—it does\nnot take long to make Father Mestienne drunk, he always has the\nbeginning of it about him,—I lay him under the table, I take his card,\nso that I can get into the cemetery again, and I return without him.\nThen you have no longer any one but me to deal with. If he is drunk, I\nshall say to him: ‘Be off; I will do your work for you.’ Off he goes,\nand I drag you out of the hole.”\n\n\nJean Valjean held out his hand, and Fauchelevent precipitated himself\nupon it with the touching effusion of a peasant.\n\n“That is settled, Father Fauchelevent. All will go well.”\n\n\n“Provided nothing goes wrong,” thought Fauchelevent. “In that case, it\nwould be terrible.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BE DRUNK IN ORDER TO BE IMMORTAL\n\n\nOn the following day, as the sun was declining, the very rare\npassers-by on the Boulevard du Maine pulled off their hats to an\nold-fashioned hearse, ornamented with skulls, cross-bones, and tears.\nThis hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which\nspread a large black cross, like a huge corpse with drooping arms. A\nmourning-coach, in which could be seen a priest in his surplice, and a\nchoir boy in his red cap, followed. Two undertaker’s men in gray\nuniforms trimmed with black walked on the right and the left of the\nhearse. Behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer, who\nlimped along. The procession was going in the direction of the\nVaugirard cemetery.\n\nThe handle of a hammer, the blade of a cold chisel, and the antennæ of\na pair of pincers were visible, protruding from the man’s pocket.\n\nThe Vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of\nParis. It had its peculiar usages, just as it had its carriage entrance\nand its house door, which old people in the quarter, who clung\ntenaciously to ancient words, still called the _porte cavalière_ and\nthe _porte piétonne_.16 The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Rue\nPetit-Picpus had obtained permission, as we have already stated, to be\nburied there in a corner apart, and at night, the plot of land having\nformerly belonged to their community. The grave-diggers being thus\nbound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter, in\nthis cemetery, they were subjected to a special discipline. The gates\nof the Paris cemeteries closed, at that epoch, at sundown, and this\nbeing a municipal regulation, the Vaugirard cemetery was bound by it\nlike the rest. The carriage gate and the house door were two contiguous\ngrated gates, adjoining a pavilion built by the architect Perronet, and\ninhabited by the door-keeper of the cemetery. These gates, therefore,\nswung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun\ndisappeared behind the dome of the Invalides. If any grave-digger were\ndelayed after that moment in the cemetery, there was but one way for\nhim to get out—his grave-digger’s card furnished by the department of\npublic funerals. A sort of letter-box was constructed in the porter’s\nwindow. The grave-digger dropped his card into this box, the porter\nheard it fall, pulled the rope, and the small door opened. If the man\nhad not his card, he mentioned his name, the porter, who was sometimes\nin bed and asleep, rose, came out and identified the man, and opened\nthe gate with his key; the grave-digger stepped out, but had to pay a\nfine of fifteen francs.\n\nThis cemetery, with its peculiarities outside the regulations,\nembarrassed the symmetry of the administration. It was suppressed a\nlittle later than 1830. The cemetery of Mont-Parnasse, called the\nEastern cemetery, succeeded to it, and inherited that famous dram-shop\nnext to the Vaugirard cemetery, which was surmounted by a quince\npainted on a board, and which formed an angle, one side on the\ndrinkers’ tables, and the other on the tombs, with this sign: _Au Bon\nCoing_.\n\nThe Vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery. It was\nfalling into disuse. Dampness was invading it, the flowers were\ndeserting it. The bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the\nVaugirard; it hinted at poverty. Père-Lachaise if you please! to be\nburied in Père-Lachaise is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany.\nIt is recognized as elegant. The Vaugirard cemetery was a venerable\nenclosure, planted like an old-fashioned French garden. Straight\nalleys, box, thuya-trees, holly, ancient tombs beneath aged\ncypress-trees, and very tall grass. In the evening it was tragic there.\nThere were very lugubrious lines about it.\n\nThe sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pall and the\nblack cross entered the avenue of the Vaugirard cemetery. The lame man\nwho followed it was no other than Fauchelevent.\n\nThe interment of Mother Crucifixion in the vault under the altar, the\nexit of Cosette, the introduction of Jean Valjean to the dead-room,—all\nhad been executed without difficulty, and there had been no hitch.\n\nLet us remark in passing, that the burial of Mother Crucifixion under\nthe altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight. It\nis one of the faults which resemble a duty. The nuns had committed it,\nnot only without difficulty, but even with the applause of their own\nconsciences. In the cloister, what is called the “government” is only\nan intermeddling with authority, an interference which is always\nquestionable. In the first place, the rule; as for the code, we shall\nsee. Make as many laws as you please, men; but keep them for\nyourselves. The tribute to Cæsar is never anything but the remnants of\nthe tribute to God. A prince is nothing in the presence of a principle.\n\nFauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame\nof mind. His twin plots, the one with the nuns, the one for the\nconvent, the other against it, the other with M. Madeleine, had\nsucceeded, to all appearance. Jean Valjean’s composure was one of those\npowerful tranquillities which are contagious. Fauchelevent no longer\nfelt doubtful as to his success.\n\nWhat remained to be done was a mere nothing. Within the last two years,\nhe had made good Father Mestienne, a chubby-cheeked person, drunk at\nleast ten times. He played with Father Mestienne. He did what he liked\nwith him. He made him dance according to his whim. Mestienne’s head\nadjusted itself to the cap of Fauchelevent’s will. Fauchelevent’s\nconfidence was perfect.\n\nAt the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the\ncemetery, Fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse, and said half\naloud, as he rubbed his big hands:—\n\n“Here’s a fine farce!”\n\n\nAll at once the hearse halted; it had reached the gate. The permission\nfor interment must be exhibited. The undertaker’s man addressed himself\nto the porter of the cemetery. During this colloquy, which always is\nproductive of a delay of from one to two minutes, some one, a stranger,\ncame and placed himself behind the hearse, beside Fauchelevent. He was\na sort of laboring man, who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and\ncarried a mattock under his arm.\n\nFauchelevent surveyed this stranger.\n\n“Who are you?” he demanded.\n\n“The man replied:—\n\n“The grave-digger.”\n\n\nIf a man could survive the blow of a cannon-ball full in the breast, he\nwould make the same face that Fauchelevent made.\n\n“The grave-digger?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“You?”\n\n\n“I.”\n\n\n“Father Mestienne is the grave-digger.”\n\n\n“He was.”\n\n\n“What! He was?”\n\n\n“He is dead.”\n\n\nFauchelevent had expected anything but this, that a grave-digger could\ndie. It is true, nevertheless, that grave-diggers do die themselves. By\ndint of excavating graves for other people, one hollows out one’s own.\n\nFauchelevent stood there with his mouth wide open. He had hardly the\nstrength to stammer:—\n\n“But it is not possible!”\n\n\n“It is so.”\n\n\n“But,” he persisted feebly, “Father Mestienne is the grave-digger.”\n\n\n“After Napoleon, Louis XVIII. After Mestienne, Gribier. Peasant, my\nname is Gribier.”\n\n\nFauchelevent, who was deadly pale, stared at this Gribier.\n\nHe was a tall, thin, livid, utterly funereal man. He had the air of an\nunsuccessful doctor who had turned grave-digger.\n\nFauchelevent burst out laughing.\n\n“Ah!” said he, “what queer things do happen! Father Mestienne is dead,\nbut long live little Father Lenoir! Do you know who little Father\nLenoir is? He is a jug of red wine. It is a jug of Surêne, morbigou! of\nreal Paris Surêne? Ah! So old Mestienne is dead! I am sorry for it; he\nwas a jolly fellow. But you are a jolly fellow, too. Are you not,\ncomrade? We’ll go and have a drink together presently.”\n\n\nThe man replied:—\n\n“I have been a student. I passed my fourth examination. I never drink.”\n\n\nThe hearse had set out again, and was rolling up the grand alley of the\ncemetery.\n\nFauchelevent had slackened his pace. He limped more out of anxiety than\nfrom infirmity.\n\nThe grave-digger walked on in front of him.\n\nFauchelevent passed the unexpected Gribier once more in review.\n\nHe was one of those men who, though very young, have the air of age,\nand who, though slender, are extremely strong.\n\n“Comrade!” cried Fauchelevent.\n\nThe man turned round.\n\n“I am the convent grave-digger.”\n\n\n“My colleague,” said the man.\n\nFauchelevent, who was illiterate but very sharp, understood that he had\nto deal with a formidable species of man, with a fine talker. He\nmuttered:\n\n“So Father Mestienne is dead.”\n\n\nThe man replied:—\n\n“Completely. The good God consulted his note-book which shows when the\ntime is up. It was Father Mestienne’s turn. Father Mestienne died.”\n\n\nFauchelevent repeated mechanically: “The good God—”\n\n\n“The good God,” said the man authoritatively. “According to the\nphilosophers, the Eternal Father; according to the Jacobins, the\nSupreme Being.”\n\n\n“Shall we not make each other’s acquaintance?” stammered Fauchelevent.\n\n“It is made. You are a peasant, I am a Parisian.”\n\n\n“People do not know each other until they have drunk together. He who\nempties his glass empties his heart. You must come and have a drink\nwith me. Such a thing cannot be refused.”\n\n\n“Business first.”\n\n\nFauchelevent thought: “I am lost.”\n\n\nThey were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley\nleading to the nuns’ corner.\n\nThe grave-digger resumed:—\n\n“Peasant, I have seven small children who must be fed. As they must\neat, I cannot drink.”\n\n\nAnd he added, with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a\nphrase well:—\n\n“Their hunger is the enemy of my thirst.”\n\n\nThe hearse skirted a clump of cypress-trees, quitted the grand alley,\nturned into a narrow one, entered the waste land, and plunged into a\nthicket. This indicated the immediate proximity of the place of\nsepulture. Fauchelevent slackened his pace, but he could not detain the\nhearse. Fortunately, the soil, which was light and wet with the winter\nrains, clogged the wheels and retarded its speed.\n\nHe approached the grave-digger.\n\n“They have such a nice little Argenteuil wine,” murmured Fauchelevent.\n\n“Villager,” retorted the man, “I ought not be a grave-digger. My father\nwas a porter at the Prytaneum [Town-Hall]. He destined me for\nliterature. But he had reverses. He had losses on ‘change. I was\nobliged to renounce the profession of author. But I am still a public\nwriter.”\n\n\n“So you are not a grave-digger, then?” returned Fauchelevent, clutching\nat this branch, feeble as it was.\n\n“The one does not hinder the other. I cumulate.”\n\n\nFauchelevent did not understand this last word.\n\n“Come have a drink,” said he.\n\nHere a remark becomes necessary. Fauchelevent, whatever his anguish,\noffered a drink, but he did not explain himself on one point; who was\nto pay? Generally, Fauchelevent offered and Father Mestienne paid. An\noffer of a drink was the evident result of the novel situation created\nby the new grave-digger, and it was necessary to make this offer, but\nthe old gardener left the proverbial quarter of an hour named after\nRabelais in the dark, and that not unintentionally. As for himself,\nFauchelevent did not wish to pay, troubled as he was.\n\nThe grave-digger went on with a superior smile:—\n\n“One must eat. I have accepted Father Mestienne’s reversion. One gets\nto be a philosopher when one has nearly completed his classes. To the\nlabor of the hand I join the labor of the arm. I have my scrivener’s\nstall in the market of the Rue de Sèvres. You know? the Umbrella\nMarket. All the cooks of the Red Cross apply to me. I scribble their\ndeclarations of love to the raw soldiers. In the morning I write love\nletters; in the evening I dig graves. Such is life, rustic.”\n\n\nThe hearse was still advancing. Fauchelevent, uneasy to the last\ndegree, was gazing about him on all sides. Great drops of perspiration\ntrickled down from his brow.\n\n“But,” continued the grave-digger, “a man cannot serve two mistresses.\nI must choose between the pen and the mattock. The mattock is ruining\nmy hand.”\n\n\nThe hearse halted.\n\nThe choir boy alighted from the mourning-coach, then the priest.\n\nOne of the small front wheels of the hearse had run up a little on a\npile of earth, beyond which an open grave was visible.\n\n“What a farce this is!” repeated Fauchelevent in consternation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—BETWEEN FOUR PLANKS\n\n\nWho was in the coffin? The reader knows. Jean Valjean.\n\nJean Valjean had arranged things so that he could exist there, and he\ncould almost breathe.\n\nIt is a strange thing to what a degree security of conscience confers\nsecurity of the rest. Every combination thought out by Jean Valjean had\nbeen progressing, and progressing favorably, since the preceding day.\nHe, like Fauchelevent, counted on Father Mestienne. He had no doubt as\nto the end. Never was there a more critical situation, never more\ncomplete composure.\n\nThe four planks of the coffin breathe out a kind of terrible peace. It\nseemed as though something of the repose of the dead entered into Jean\nValjean’s tranquillity.\n\nFrom the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow, and he had\nfollowed, all the phases of the terrible drama which he was playing\nwith death.\n\nShortly after Fauchelevent had finished nailing on the upper plank,\nJean Valjean had felt himself carried out, then driven off. He knew,\nfrom the diminution in the jolting, when they left the pavements and\nreached the earth road. He had divined, from a dull noise, that they\nwere crossing the bridge of Austerlitz. At the first halt, he had\nunderstood that they were entering the cemetery; at the second halt, he\nsaid to himself:—\n\n“Here is the grave.”\n\n\nSuddenly, he felt hands seize the coffin, then a harsh grating against\nthe planks; he explained it to himself as the rope which was being\nfastened round the casket in order to lower it into the cavity.\n\nThen he experienced a giddiness.\n\nThe undertaker’s man and the grave-digger had probably allowed the\ncoffin to lose its balance, and had lowered the head before the foot.\nHe recovered himself fully when he felt himself horizontal and\nmotionless. He had just touched the bottom.\n\nHe had a certain sensation of cold.\n\nA voice rose above him, glacial and solemn. He heard Latin words, which\nhe did not understand, pass over him, so slowly that he was able to\ncatch them one by one:—\n\n_“Qui dormiunt in terræ pulvere, evigilabunt; alii in vitam æternam, et\nalii in approbrium, ut videant semper.” _\n\nA child’s voice said:—\n\n_“De profundis.” _\n\nThe grave voice began again:—\n\n_“Requiem æternam dona ei, Domine.” _\n\nThe child’s voice responded:—\n\n_“Et lux perpetua luceat ei.” _\n\nHe heard something like the gentle patter of several drops of rain on\nthe plank which covered him. It was probably the holy water.\n\nHe thought: “This will be over soon now. Patience for a little while\nlonger. The priest will take his departure. Fauchelevent will take\nMestienne off to drink. I shall be left. Then Fauchelevent will return\nalone, and I shall get out. That will be the work of a good hour.”\n\n\nThe grave voice resumed\n\n_“Requiescat in pace.” _\n\nAnd the child’s voice said:—\n\n_“Amen.” _\n\nJean Valjean strained his ears, and heard something like retreating\nfootsteps.\n\n“There, they are going now,” thought he. “I am alone.”\n\n\nAll at once, he heard over his head a sound which seemed to him to be a\nclap of thunder.\n\nIt was a shovelful of earth falling on the coffin.\n\nA second shovelful fell.\n\nOne of the holes through which he breathed had just been stopped up.\n\nA third shovelful of earth fell.\n\nThen a fourth.\n\nThere are things which are too strong for the strongest man. Jean\nValjean lost consciousness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE ORIGIN OF THE SAYING: DON’T LOSE\nTHE CARD\n\n\nThis is what had taken place above the coffin in which lay Jean\nValjean.\n\nWhen the hearse had driven off, when the priest and the choir boy had\nentered the carriage again and taken their departure, Fauchelevent, who\nhad not taken his eyes from the grave-digger, saw the latter bend over\nand grasp his shovel, which was sticking upright in the heap of dirt.\n\nThen Fauchelevent took a supreme resolve.\n\nHe placed himself between the grave and the grave-digger, crossed his\narms and said:—\n\n“I am the one to pay!”\n\n\nThe grave-digger stared at him in amazement, and replied:—\n\n“What’s that, peasant?”\n\n\nFauchelevent repeated:—\n\n“I am the one who pays!”\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“For the wine.”\n\n\n“What wine?”\n\n\n“That Argenteuil wine.”\n\n\n“Where is the Argenteuil?”\n\n\n“At the _Bon Coing_.”\n\n\n“Go to the devil!” said the grave-digger.\n\nAnd he flung a shovelful of earth on the coffin.\n\nThe coffin gave back a hollow sound. Fauchelevent felt himself stagger\nand on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself. He shouted\nin a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began to\nmingle:—\n\n“Comrade! Before the _Bon Coing_ is shut!”\n\n\nThe grave-digger took some more earth on his shovel. Fauchelevent\ncontinued.\n\n“I will pay.”\n\n\nAnd he seized the man’s arm.\n\n“Listen to me, comrade. I am the convent grave-digger, I have come to\nhelp you. It is a business which can be performed at night. Let us\nbegin, then, by going for a drink.”\n\n\nAnd as he spoke, and clung to this desperate insistence, this\nmelancholy reflection occurred to him: “And if he drinks, will he get\ndrunk?”\n\n\n“Provincial,” said the man, “if you positively insist upon it, I\nconsent. We will drink. After work, never before.”\n\n\nAnd he flourished his shovel briskly. Fauchelevent held him back.\n\n“It is Argenteuil wine, at six.”\n\n\n“Oh, come,” said the grave-digger, “you are a bell-ringer. Ding dong,\nding dong, that’s all you know how to say. Go hang yourself.”\n\n\nAnd he threw in a second shovelful.\n\nFauchelevent had reached a point where he no longer knew what he was\nsaying.\n\n“Come along and drink,” he cried, “since it is I who pays the bill.”\n\n\n“When we have put the child to bed,” said the grave-digger.\n\nHe flung in a third shovelful.\n\nThen he thrust his shovel into the earth and added:—\n\n“It’s cold to-night, you see, and the corpse would shriek out after us\nif we were to plant her there without a coverlet.”\n\n\nAt that moment, as he loaded his shovel, the grave-digger bent over,\nand the pocket of his waistcoat gaped. Fauchelevent’s wild gaze fell\nmechanically into that pocket, and there it stopped.\n\nThe sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon; there was still light\nenough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of\nthat yawning pocket.\n\nThe sum total of lightning that the eye of a Picard peasant can\ncontain, traversed Fauchelevent’s pupils. An idea had just occurred to\nhim.\n\nHe thrust his hand into the pocket from behind, without the\ngrave-digger, who was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth,\nobserving it, and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom\nof it.\n\nThe man sent a fourth shovelful tumbling into the grave.\n\nJust as he turned round to get the fifth, Fauchelevent looked calmly at\nhim and said:—\n\n“By the way, you new man, have you your card?”\n\n\nThe grave-digger paused.\n\n“What card?”\n\n\n“The sun is on the point of setting.”\n\n\n“That’s good, it is going to put on its nightcap.”\n\n\n“The gate of the cemetery will close immediately.”\n\n\n“Well, what then?”\n\n\n“Have you your card?”\n\n\n“Ah! my card?” said the grave-digger.\n\nAnd he fumbled in his pocket.\n\nHaving searched one pocket, he proceeded to search the other. He passed\non to his fobs, explored the first, returned to the second.\n\n“Why, no,” said he, “I have not my card. I must have forgotten it.”\n\n\n“Fifteen francs fine,” said Fauchelevent.\n\nThe grave-digger turned green. Green is the pallor of livid people.\n\n“Ah! Jésus-mon-Dieu-bancroche-à-bas-la-lune!”17 he exclaimed. “Fifteen\nfrancs fine!”\n\n\n“Three pieces of a hundred sous,” said Fauchelevent.\n\nThe grave-digger dropped his shovel.\n\nFauchelevent’s turn had come.\n\n“Ah, come now, conscript,” said Fauchelevent, “none of this despair.\nThere is no question of committing suicide and benefiting the grave.\nFifteen francs is fifteen francs, and besides, you may not be able to\npay it. I am an old hand, you are a new one. I know all the ropes and\nthe devices. I will give you some friendly advice. One thing is clear,\nthe sun is on the point of setting, it is touching the dome now, the\ncemetery will be closed in five minutes more.”\n\n\n“That is true,” replied the man.\n\n“Five minutes more and you will not have time to fill the grave, it is\nas hollow as the devil, this grave, and to reach the gate in season to\npass it before it is shut.”\n\n\n“That is true.”\n\n\n“In that case, a fine of fifteen francs.”\n\n\n“Fifteen francs.”\n\n\n“But you have time. Where do you live?”\n\n\n“A couple of steps from the barrier, a quarter of an hour from here.\nNo. 87 Rue de Vaugirard.”\n\n\n“You have just time to get out by taking to your heels at your best\nspeed.”\n\n\n“That is exactly so.”\n\n\n“Once outside the gate, you gallop home, you get your card, you return,\nthe cemetery porter admits you. As you have your card, there will be\nnothing to pay. And you will bury your corpse. I’ll watch it for you in\nthe meantime, so that it shall not run away.”\n\n\n“I am indebted to you for my life, peasant.”\n\n\n“Decamp!” said Fauchelevent.\n\nThe grave-digger, overwhelmed with gratitude, shook his hand and set\noff on a run.\n\nWhen the man had disappeared in the thicket, Fauchelevent listened\nuntil he heard his footsteps die away in the distance, then he leaned\nover the grave, and said in a low tone:—\n\n“Father Madeleine!”\n\n\nThere was no reply.\n\nFauchelevent was seized with a shudder. He tumbled rather than climbed\ninto the grave, flung himself on the head of the coffin and cried:—\n\n“Are you there?”\n\n\nSilence in the coffin.\n\nFauchelevent, hardly able to draw his breath for trembling, seized his\ncold chisel and his hammer, and pried up the coffin lid.\n\nJean Valjean’s face appeared in the twilight; it was pale and his eyes\nwere closed.\n\nFauchelevent’s hair rose upright on his head, he sprang to his feet,\nthen fell back against the side of the grave, ready to swoon on the\ncoffin. He stared at Jean Valjean.\n\nJean Valjean lay there pallid and motionless.\n\nFauchelevent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh:—\n\n“He is dead!”\n\n\nAnd, drawing himself up, and folding his arms with such violence that\nhis clenched fists came in contact with his shoulders, he cried:—\n\n“And this is the way I save his life!”\n\n\nThen the poor man fell to sobbing. He soliloquized the while, for it is\nan error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural. Powerful emotion\noften talks aloud.\n\n“It is Father Mestienne’s fault. Why did that fool die? What need was\nthere for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one was\nexpecting it? It is he who has killed M. Madeleine. Father Madeleine!\nHe is in the coffin. It is quite handy. All is over. Now, is there any\nsense in these things? Ah! my God! he is dead! Well! and his little\ngirl, what am I to do with her? What will the fruit-seller say? The\nidea of its being possible for a man like that to die like this! When I\nthink how he put himself under that cart! Father Madeleine! Father\nMadeleine! Pardine! He was suffocated, I said so. He wouldn’t believe\nme. Well! Here’s a pretty trick to play! He is dead, that good man, the\nvery best man out of all the good God’s good folks! And his little\ngirl! Ah! In the first place, I won’t go back there myself. I shall\nstay here. After having done such a thing as that! What’s the use of\nbeing two old men, if we are two old fools! But, in the first place,\nhow did he manage to enter the convent? That was the beginning of it\nall. One should not do such things. Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine!\nFather Madeleine! Madeleine! Monsieur Madeleine! Monsieur le Maire! He\ndoes not hear me. Now get out of this scrape if you can!”\n\n\nAnd he tore his hair.\n\nA grating sound became audible through the trees in the distance. It\nwas the cemetery gate closing.\n\nFauchelevent bent over Jean Valjean, and all at once he bounded back\nand recoiled so far as the limits of a grave permit.\n\nJean Valjean’s eyes were open and gazing at him.\n\nTo see a corpse is alarming, to behold a resurrection is almost as much\nso. Fauchelevent became like stone, pale, haggard, overwhelmed by all\nthese excesses of emotion, not knowing whether he had to do with a\nliving man or a dead one, and staring at Jean Valjean, who was gazing\nat him.\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nThe Resurrection 2b8-7-resurrection\n\n\n“I fell asleep,” said Jean Valjean.\n\nAnd he raised himself to a sitting posture.\n\nFauchelevent fell on his knees.\n\n“Just, good Virgin! How you frightened me!”\n\n\nThen he sprang to his feet and cried:—\n\n“Thanks, Father Madeleine!”\n\n\nJean Valjean had merely fainted. The fresh air had revived him.\n\nJoy is the ebb of terror. Fauchelevent found almost as much difficulty\nin recovering himself as Jean Valjean had.\n\n“So you are not dead! Oh! How wise you are! I called you so much that\nyou came back. When I saw your eyes shut, I said: ‘Good! there he is,\nstifled,’ I should have gone raving mad, mad enough for a strait\njacket. They would have put me in Bicêtre. What do you suppose I should\nhave done if you had been dead? And your little girl? There’s that\nfruit-seller,—she would never have understood it! The child is thrust\ninto your arms, and then—the grandfather is dead! What a story! good\nsaints of paradise, what a tale! Ah! you are alive, that’s the best of\nit!”\n\n\n“I am cold,” said Jean Valjean.\n\nThis remark recalled Fauchelevent thoroughly to reality, and there was\npressing need of it. The souls of these two men were troubled even when\nthey had recovered themselves, although they did not realize it, and\nthere was about them something uncanny, which was the sinister\nbewilderment inspired by the place.\n\n“Let us get out of here quickly,” exclaimed Fauchelevent.\n\nHe fumbled in his pocket, and pulled out a gourd with which he had\nprovided himself.\n\n“But first, take a drop,” said he.\n\nThe flask finished what the fresh air had begun, Jean Valjean swallowed\na mouthful of brandy, and regained full possession of his faculties.\n\nHe got out of the coffin, and helped Fauchelevent to nail on the lid\nagain.\n\nThree minutes later they were out of the grave.\n\nMoreover, Fauchelevent was perfectly composed. He took his time. The\ncemetery was closed. The arrival of the grave-digger Gribier was not to\nbe apprehended. That “conscript” was at home busily engaged in looking\nfor his card, and at some difficulty in finding it in his lodgings,\nsince it was in Fauchelevent’s pocket. Without a card, he could not get\nback into the cemetery.\n\nFauchelevent took the shovel, and Jean Valjean the pick-axe, and\ntogether they buried the empty coffin.\n\nWhen the grave was full, Fauchelevent said to Jean Valjean:—\n\n“Let us go. I will keep the shovel; do you carry off the mattock.”\n\n\nNight was falling.\n\nJean Valjean experienced some difficulty in moving and in walking. He\nhad stiffened himself in that coffin, and had become a little like a\ncorpse. The rigidity of death had seized upon him between those four\nplanks. He had, in a manner, to thaw out, from the tomb.\n\n“You are benumbed,” said Fauchelevent. “It is a pity that I have a game\nleg, for otherwise we might step out briskly.”\n\n\n“Bah!” replied Jean Valjean, “four paces will put life into my legs\nonce more.”\n\n\nThey set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed. On\narriving before the closed gate and the porter’s pavilion Fauchelevent,\nwho held the grave-digger’s card in his hand, dropped it into the box,\nthe porter pulled the rope, the gate opened, and they went out.\n\n“How well everything is going!” said Fauchelevent; “what a capital idea\nthat was of yours, Father Madeleine!”\n\n\nThey passed the Vaugirard barrier in the simplest manner in the world.\nIn the neighborhood of the cemetery, a shovel and pick are equal to two\npassports.\n\nThe Rue Vaugirard was deserted.\n\n“Father Madeleine,” said Fauchelevent as they went along, and raising\nhis eyes to the houses, “Your eyes are better than mine. Show me No.\n87.”\n\n\n“Here it is,” said Jean Valjean.\n\n“There is no one in the street,” said Fauchelevent. “Give me your\nmattock and wait a couple of minutes for me.”\n\n\nFauchelevent entered No. 87, ascended to the very top, guided by the\ninstinct which always leads the poor man to the garret, and knocked in\nthe dark, at the door of an attic.\n\nA voice replied: “Come in.”\n\n\nIt was Gribier’s voice.\n\nFauchelevent opened the door. The grave-digger’s dwelling was, like all\nsuch wretched habitations, an unfurnished and encumbered garret. A\npacking-case—a coffin, perhaps—took the place of a commode, a\nbutter-pot served for a drinking-fountain, a straw mattress served for\na bed, the floor served instead of tables and chairs. In a corner, on a\ntattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet, a thin woman\nand a number of children were piled in a heap. The whole of this\npoverty-stricken interior bore traces of having been overturned. One\nwould have said that there had been an earthquake “for one.” The covers\nwere displaced, the rags scattered about, the jug broken, the mother\nhad been crying, the children had probably been beaten; traces of a\nvigorous and ill-tempered search. It was plain that the grave-digger\nhad made a desperate search for his card, and had made everybody in the\ngarret, from the jug to his wife, responsible for its loss. He wore an\nair of desperation.\n\nBut Fauchelevent was in too great a hurry to terminate this adventure\nto take any notice of this sad side of his success.\n\nHe entered and said:—\n\n“I have brought you back your shovel and pick.”\n\n\nGribier gazed at him in stupefaction.\n\n“Is it you, peasant?”\n\n\n“And to-morrow morning you will find your card with the porter of the\ncemetery.”\n\n\nAnd he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor.\n\n“What is the meaning of this?” demanded Gribier.\n\n“The meaning of it is, that you dropped your card out of your pocket,\nthat I found it on the ground after you were gone, that I have buried\nthe corpse, that I have filled the grave, that I have done your work,\nthat the porter will return your card to you, and that you will not\nhave to pay fifteen francs. There you have it, conscript.”\n\n\n“Thanks, villager!” exclaimed Gribier, radiant. “The next time I will\npay for the drinks.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—A SUCCESSFUL INTERROGATORY\n\n\nAn hour later, in the darkness of night, two men and a child presented\nthemselves at No. 62 Rue Petit-Picpus. The elder of the men lifted the\nknocker and rapped.\n\nThey were Fauchelevent, Jean Valjean, and Cosette.\n\nThe two old men had gone to fetch Cosette from the fruiterer’s in the\nRue du Chemin-Vert, where Fauchelevent had deposited her on the\npreceding day. Cosette had passed these twenty-four hours trembling\nsilently and understanding nothing. She trembled to such a degree that\nshe wept. She had neither eaten nor slept. The worthy fruit-seller had\nplied her with a hundred questions, without obtaining any other reply\nthan a melancholy and unvarying gaze. Cosette had betrayed nothing of\nwhat she had seen and heard during the last two days. She divined that\nthey were passing through a crisis. She was deeply conscious that it\nwas necessary to “be good.” Who has not experienced the sovereign power\nof those two words, pronounced with a certain accent in the ear of a\nterrified little being: _Say nothing! _ Fear is mute. Moreover, no one\nguards a secret like a child.\n\nBut when, at the expiration of these lugubrious twenty-four hours, she\nbeheld Jean Valjean again, she gave vent to such a cry of joy, that any\nthoughtful person who had chanced to hear that cry, would have guessed\nthat it issued from an abyss.\n\nFauchelevent belonged to the convent and knew the pass-words. All the\ndoors opened.\n\nThus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and\nhow to get in.\n\nThe porter, who had received his instructions, opened the little\nservant’s door which connected the courtyard with the garden, and which\ncould still be seen from the street twenty years ago, in the wall at\nthe bottom of the court, which faced the carriage entrance.\n\nThe porter admitted all three of them through this door, and from that\npoint they reached the inner, reserved parlor where Fauchelevent, on\nthe preceding day, had received his orders from the prioress.\n\nThe prioress, rosary in hand, was waiting for them. A vocal mother,\nwith her veil lowered, stood beside her.\n\nA discreet candle lighted, one might almost say, made a show of\nlighting the parlor.\n\nThe prioress passed Jean Valjean in review. There is nothing which\nexamines like a downcast eye.\n\nThen she questioned him:—\n\n“You are the brother?”\n\n\n“Yes, reverend Mother,” replied Fauchelevent.\n\n“What is your name?”\n\n\nFauchelevent replied:—\n\n“Ultime Fauchelevent.”\n\n\nHe really had had a brother named Ultime, who was dead.\n\n“Where do you come from?”\n\n\nFauchelevent replied:—\n\n“From Picquigny, near Amiens.”\n\n\n“What is your age?”\n\n\nFauchelevent replied:—\n\n“Fifty.”\n\n\n“What is your profession?”\n\n\nFauchelevent replied:—\n\n“Gardener.”\n\n\n“Are you a good Christian?”\n\n\nFauchelevent replied:—\n\n“Every one is in the family.”\n\n\n“Is this your little girl?”\n\n\nFauchelevent replied:—\n\n“Yes, reverend Mother.”\n\n\n“You are her father?”\n\n\nFauchelevent replied:—\n\n“Her grandfather.”\n\n\nThe vocal mother said to the prioress in a low voice\n\n“He answers well.”\n\n\nJean Valjean had not uttered a single word.\n\nThe prioress looked attentively at Cosette, and said half aloud to the\nvocal mother:—\n\n“She will grow up ugly.”\n\n\nThe two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the\ncorner of the parlor, then the prioress turned round and said:—\n\n“Father Fauvent, you will get another knee-cap with a bell. Two will be\nrequired now.”\n\n\nOn the following day, therefore, two bells were audible in the garden,\nand the nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner of\ntheir veils. At the extreme end of the garden, under the trees, two\nmen, Fauvent and another man, were visible as they dug side by side. An\nenormous event. Their silence was broken to the extent of saying to\neach other: “He is an assistant gardener.”\n\n\nThe vocal mothers added: “He is a brother of Father Fauvent.”\n\n\nJean Valjean was, in fact, regularly installed; he had his belled\nknee-cap; henceforth he was official. His name was Ultime Fauchelevent.\n\nThe most powerful determining cause of his admission had been the\nprioress’s observation upon Cosette: “She will grow up ugly.”\n\n\nThe prioress, that pronounced prognosticator, immediately took a fancy\nto Cosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil.\n\nThere is nothing that is not strictly logical about this.\n\nIt is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent, women are\nconscious of their faces; now, girls who are conscious of their beauty\ndo not easily become nuns; the vocation being voluntary in inverse\nproportion to their good looks, more is to be hoped from the ugly than\nfrom the pretty. Hence a lively taste for plain girls.\n\nThe whole of this adventure increased the importance of good, old\nFauchelevent; he won a triple success; in the eyes of Jean Valjean,\nwhom he had saved and sheltered; in those of grave-digger Gribier, who\nsaid to himself: “He spared me that fine”; with the convent, which,\nbeing enabled, thanks to him, to retain the coffin of Mother\nCrucifixion under the altar, eluded Cæsar and satisfied God. There was\na coffin containing a body in the Petit-Picpus, and a coffin without a\nbody in the Vaugirard cemetery, public order had no doubt been deeply\ndisturbed thereby, but no one was aware of it.\n\nAs for the convent, its gratitude to Fauchelevent was very great.\nFauchelevent became the best of servitors and the most precious of\ngardeners. Upon the occasion of the archbishop’s next visit, the\nprioress recounted the affair to his Grace, making something of a\nconfession at the same time, and yet boasting of her deed. On leaving\nthe convent, the archbishop mentioned it with approval, and in a\nwhisper to M. de Latil, Monsieur’s confessor, afterwards Archbishop of\nReims and Cardinal. This admiration for Fauchelevent became widespread,\nfor it made its way to Rome. We have seen a note addressed by the then\nreigning Pope, Leo XII., to one of his relatives, a Monsignor in the\nNuncio’s establishment in Paris, and bearing, like himself, the name of\nDella Genga; it contained these lines: “It appears that there is in a\nconvent in Paris an excellent gardener, who is also a holy man, named\nFauvent.” Nothing of this triumph reached Fauchelevent in his hut; he\nwent on grafting, weeding, and covering up his melon beds, without in\nthe least suspecting his excellences and his sanctity. Neither did he\nsuspect his glory, any more than a Durham or Surrey bull whose portrait\nis published in the _London Illustrated News_, with this inscription:\n“Bull which carried off the prize at the Cattle Show.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—CLOISTERED\n\n\nCosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent.\n\nIt was quite natural that Cosette should think herself Jean Valjean’s\ndaughter. Moreover, as she knew nothing, she could say nothing, and\nthen, she would not have said anything in any case. As we have just\nobserved, nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness. Cosette\nhad suffered so much, that she feared everything, even to speak or to\nbreathe. A single word had so often brought down an avalanche upon her.\nShe had hardly begun to regain her confidence since she had been with\nJean Valjean. She speedily became accustomed to the convent. Only she\nregretted Catherine, but she dared not say so. Once, however, she did\nsay to Jean Valjean: “Father, if I had known, I would have brought her\naway with me.”\n\n\nCosette had been obliged, on becoming a scholar in the convent, to don\nthe garb of the pupils of the house. Jean Valjean succeeded in getting\nthem to restore to him the garments which she laid aside. This was the\nsame mourning suit which he had made her put on when she had quitted\nthe Thénardiers’ inn. It was not very threadbare even now. Jean Valjean\nlocked up these garments, plus the stockings and the shoes, with a\nquantity of camphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound, in\na little valise which he found means of procuring. He set this valise\non a chair near his bed, and he always carried the key about his\nperson. “Father,” Cosette asked him one day, “what is there in that box\nwhich smells so good?”\n\n\nFather Fauchelevent received other recompense for his good action, in\naddition to the glory which we just mentioned, and of which he knew\nnothing; in the first place it made him happy; next, he had much less\nwork, since it was shared. Lastly, as he was very fond of snuff, he\nfound the presence of M. Madeleine an advantage, in that he used three\ntimes as much as he had done previously, and that in an infinitely more\nluxurious manner, seeing that M. Madeleine paid for it.\n\nThe nuns did not adopt the name of Ultime; they called Jean Valjean\n_the other Fauvent_.\n\nIf these holy women had possessed anything of Javert’s glance, they\nwould eventually have noticed that when there was any errand to be done\noutside in the behalf of the garden, it was always the elder\nFauchelevent, the old, the infirm, the lame man, who went, and never\nthe other; but whether it is that eyes constantly fixed on God know not\nhow to spy, or whether they were, by preference, occupied in keeping\nwatch on each other, they paid no heed to this.\n\nMoreover, it was well for Jean Valjean that he kept close and did not\nstir out. Javert watched the quarter for more than a month.\n\nThis convent was for Jean Valjean like an island surrounded by gulfs.\nHenceforth, those four walls constituted his world. He saw enough of\nthe sky there to enable him to preserve his serenity, and Cosette\nenough to remain happy.\n\nA very sweet life began for him.\n\nHe inhabited the old hut at the end of the garden, in company with\nFauchelevent. This hovel, built of old rubbish, which was still in\nexistence in 1845, was composed, as the reader already knows, of three\nchambers, all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond the\nwalls. The principal one had been given up, by force, for Jean Valjean\nhad opposed it in vain, to M. Madeleine, by Father Fauchelevent. The\nwalls of this chamber had for ornament, in addition to the two nails\nwhereon to hang the knee-cap and the basket, a Royalist bank-note of\n’93, applied to the wall over the chimney-piece, and of which the\nfollowing is an exact facsimile:—\n\n\n\nRoyalist Bank-note  2b8-9-banknote\n\n\nThis specimen of Vendean paper money had been nailed to the wall by the\npreceding gardener, an old Chouan, who had died in the convent, and\nwhose place Fauchelevent had taken.\n\nJean Valjean worked in the garden every day and made himself very\nuseful. He had formerly been a pruner of trees, and he gladly found\nhimself a gardener once more. It will be remembered that he knew all\nsorts of secrets and receipts for agriculture. He turned these to\nadvantage. Almost all the trees in the orchard were ungrafted, and\nwild. He budded them and made them produce excellent fruit.\n\nCosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day. As the\nsisters were melancholy and he was kind, the child made comparisons and\nadored him. At the appointed hour she flew to the hut. When she entered\nthe lowly cabin, she filled it with paradise. Jean Valjean blossomed\nout and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which he\nafforded Cosette. The joy which we inspire has this charming property,\nthat, far from growing meagre, like all reflections, it returns to us\nmore radiant than ever. At recreation hours, Jean Valjean watched her\nrunning and playing in the distance, and he distinguished her laugh\nfrom that of the rest.\n\nFor Cosette laughed now.\n\nCosette’s face had even undergone a change, to a certain extent. The\ngloom had disappeared from it. A smile is the same as sunshine; it\nbanishes winter from the human countenance.\n\nRecreation over, when Cosette went into the house again, Jean Valjean\ngazed at the windows of her class-room, and at night he rose to look at\nthe windows of her dormitory.\n\nGod has his own ways, moreover; the convent contributed, like Cosette,\nto uphold and complete the Bishop’s work in Jean Valjean. It is certain\nthat virtue adjoins pride on one side. A bridge built by the devil\nexists there. Jean Valjean had been, unconsciously, perhaps, tolerably\nnear that side and that bridge, when Providence cast his lot in the\nconvent of the Petit-Picpus; so long as he had compared himself only to\nthe Bishop, he had regarded himself as unworthy and had remained\nhumble; but for some time past he had been comparing himself to men in\ngeneral, and pride was beginning to spring up. Who knows? He might have\nended by returning very gradually to hatred.\n\nThe convent stopped him on that downward path.\n\nThis was the second place of captivity which he had seen. In his youth,\nin what had been for him the beginning of his life, and later on, quite\nrecently again, he had beheld another,—a frightful place, a terrible\nplace, whose severities had always appeared to him the iniquity of\njustice, and the crime of the law. Now, after the galleys, he saw the\ncloister; and when he meditated how he had formed a part of the\ngalleys, and that he now, so to speak, was a spectator of the cloister,\nhe confronted the two in his own mind with anxiety.\n\nSometimes he crossed his arms and leaned on his hoe, and slowly\ndescended the endless spirals of reverie.\n\nHe recalled his former companions: how wretched they were; they rose at\ndawn, and toiled until night; hardly were they permitted to sleep; they\nlay on camp beds, where nothing was tolerated but mattresses two inches\nthick, in rooms which were heated only in the very harshest months of\nthe year; they were clothed in frightful red blouses; they were\nallowed, as a great favor, linen trousers in the hottest weather, and a\nwoollen carter’s blouse on their backs when it was very cold; they\ndrank no wine, and ate no meat, except when they went on “fatigue\nduty.” They lived nameless, designated only by numbers, and converted,\nafter a manner, into ciphers themselves, with downcast eyes, with\nlowered voices, with shorn heads, beneath the cudgel and in disgrace.\n\nThen his mind reverted to the beings whom he had under his eyes.\n\nThese beings also lived with shorn heads, with downcast eyes, with\nlowered voices, not in disgrace, but amid the scoffs of the world, not\nwith their backs bruised with the cudgel, but with their shoulders\nlacerated with their discipline. Their names, also, had vanished from\namong men; they no longer existed except under austere appellations.\nThey never ate meat and they never drank wine; they often remained\nuntil evening without food; they were attired, not in a red blouse, but\nin a black shroud, of woollen, which was heavy in summer and thin in\nwinter, without the power to add or subtract anything from it; without\nhaving even, according to the season, the resource of the linen garment\nor the woollen cloak; and for six months in the year they wore serge\nchemises which gave them fever. They dwelt, not in rooms warmed only\nduring rigorous cold, but in cells where no fire was ever lighted; they\nslept, not on mattresses two inches thick, but on straw. And finally,\nthey were not even allowed their sleep; every night, after a day of\ntoil, they were obliged, in the weariness of their first slumber, at\nthe moment when they were falling sound asleep and beginning to get\nwarm, to rouse themselves, to rise and to go and pray in an ice-cold\nand gloomy chapel, with their knees on the stones.\n\nOn certain days each of these beings in turn had to remain for twelve\nsuccessive hours in a kneeling posture, or prostrate, with face upon\nthe pavement, and arms outstretched in the form of a cross.\n\nThe others were men; these were women.\n\nWhat had those men done? They had stolen, violated, pillaged, murdered,\nassassinated. They were bandits, counterfeiters, poisoners,\nincendiaries, murderers, parricides. What had these women done? They\nhad done nothing whatever.\n\nOn the one hand, highway robbery, fraud, deceit, violence, sensuality,\nhomicide, all sorts of sacrilege, every variety of crime; on the other,\none thing only, innocence.\n\nPerfect innocence, almost caught up into heaven in a mysterious\nassumption, attached to the earth by virtue, already possessing\nsomething of heaven through holiness.\n\nOn the one hand, confidences over crimes, which are exchanged in\nwhispers; on the other, the confession of faults made aloud. And what\ncrimes! And what faults!\n\nOn the one hand, miasms; on the other, an ineffable perfume. On the one\nhand, a moral pest, guarded from sight, penned up under the range of\ncannon, and literally devouring its plague-stricken victims; on the\nother, the chaste flame of all souls on the same hearth. There,\ndarkness; here, the shadow; but a shadow filled with gleams of light,\nand of gleams full of radiance.\n\nTwo strongholds of slavery; but in the first, deliverance possible, a\nlegal limit always in sight, and then, escape. In the second,\nperpetuity; the sole hope, at the distant extremity of the future, that\nfaint light of liberty which men call death.\n\nIn the first, men are bound only with chains; in the other, chained by\nfaith.\n\nWhat flowed from the first? An immense curse, the gnashing of teeth,\nhatred, desperate viciousness, a cry of rage against human society, a\nsarcasm against heaven.\n\nWhat results flowed from the second? Blessings and love.\n\nAnd in these two places, so similar yet so unlike, these two species of\nbeings who were so very unlike, were undergoing the same work,\nexpiation.\n\nJean Valjean understood thoroughly the expiation of the former; that\npersonal expiation, the expiation for one’s self. But he did not\nunderstand that of these last, that of creatures without reproach and\nwithout stain, and he trembled as he asked himself: The expiation of\nwhat? What expiation?\n\nA voice within his conscience replied: “The most divine of human\ngenerosities, the expiation for others.”\n\n\nHere all personal theory is withheld; we are only the narrator; we\nplace ourselves at Jean Valjean’s point of view, and we translate his\nimpressions.\n\nBefore his eyes he had the sublime summit of abnegation, the highest\npossible pitch of virtue; the innocence which pardons men their faults,\nand which expiates in their stead; servitude submitted to, torture\naccepted, punishment claimed by souls which have not sinned, for the\nsake of sparing it to souls which have fallen; the love of humanity\nswallowed up in the love of God, but even there preserving its distinct\nand mediatorial character; sweet and feeble beings possessing the\nmisery of those who are punished and the smile of those who are\nrecompensed.\n\nAnd he remembered that he had dared to murmur!\n\nOften, in the middle of the night, he rose to listen to the grateful\nsong of those innocent creatures weighed down with severities, and the\nblood ran cold in his veins at the thought that those who were justly\nchastised raised their voices heavenward only in blasphemy, and that\nhe, wretch that he was, had shaken his fist at God.\n\nThere was one striking thing which caused him to meditate deeply, like\na warning whisper from Providence itself: the scaling of that wall, the\npassing of those barriers, the adventure accepted even at the risk of\ndeath, the painful and difficult ascent, all those efforts even, which\nhe had made to escape from that other place of expiation, he had made\nin order to gain entrance into this one. Was this a symbol of his\ndestiny? This house was a prison likewise and bore a melancholy\nresemblance to that other one whence he had fled, and yet he had never\nconceived an idea of anything similar.\n\nAgain he beheld gratings, bolts, iron bars—to guard whom? Angels.\n\nThese lofty walls which he had seen around tigers, he now beheld once\nmore around lambs.\n\nThis was a place of expiation, and not of punishment; and yet, it was\nstill more austere, more gloomy, and more pitiless than the other.\n\nThese virgins were even more heavily burdened than the convicts. A\ncold, harsh wind, that wind which had chilled his youth, traversed the\nbarred and padlocked grating of the vultures; a still harsher and more\nbiting breeze blew in the cage of these doves.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhen he thought on these things, all that was within him was lost in\namazement before this mystery of sublimity.\n\nIn these meditations, his pride vanished. He scrutinized his own heart\nin all manner of ways; he felt his pettiness, and many a time he wept.\nAll that had entered into his life for the last six months had led him\nback towards the Bishop’s holy injunctions; Cosette through love, the\nconvent through humility.\n\nSometimes at eventide, in the twilight, at an hour when the garden was\ndeserted, he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the walk which\nskirted the chapel, in front of the window through which he had gazed\non the night of his arrival, and turned towards the spot where, as he\nknew, the sister was making reparation, prostrated in prayer. Thus he\nprayed as he knelt before the sister.\n\nIt seemed as though he dared not kneel directly before God.\n\nEverything that surrounded him, that peaceful garden, those fragrant\nflowers, those children who uttered joyous cries, those grave and\nsimple women, that silent cloister, slowly permeated him, and little by\nlittle, his soul became compounded of silence like the cloister, of\nperfume like the flowers, of simplicity like the women, of joy like the\nchildren. And then he reflected that these had been two houses of God\nwhich had received him in succession at two critical moments in his\nlife: the first, when all doors were closed and when human society\nrejected him; the second, at a moment when human society had again set\nout in pursuit of him, and when the galleys were again yawning; and\nthat, had it not been for the first, he should have relapsed into\ncrime, and had it not been for the second, into torment.\n\nHis whole heart melted in gratitude, and he loved more and more.\n\nMany years passed in this manner; Cosette was growing up.\n\n[THE END OF VOLUME II “COSETTE”]\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME III—MARIUS\n\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nFrontispiece Volume Three  3frontispiece\n\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nTitlepage Volume Three  3titlepage\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIRST—PARIS STUDIED IN ITS ATOM\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—PARVULUS\n\n\nParis has a child, and the forest has a bird; the bird is called the\nsparrow; the child is called the gamin.\n\nCouple these two ideas which contain, the one all the furnace, the\nother all the dawn; strike these two sparks together, Paris, childhood;\nthere leaps out from them a little being. _Homuncio_, Plautus would\nsay.\n\nThis little being is joyous. He has not food every day, and he goes to\nthe play every evening, if he sees good. He has no shirt on his body,\nno shoes on his feet, no roof over his head; he is like the flies of\nheaven, who have none of these things. He is from seven to thirteen\nyears of age, he lives in bands, roams the streets, lodges in the open\nair, wears an old pair of trousers of his father’s, which descend below\nhis heels, an old hat of some other father, which descends below his\nears, a single suspender of yellow listing; he runs, lies in wait,\nrummages about, wastes time, blackens pipes, swears like a convict,\nhaunts the wine-shop, knows thieves, calls gay women _thou_, talks\nslang, sings obscene songs, and has no evil in his heart. This is\nbecause he has in his heart a pearl, innocence; and pearls are not to\nbe dissolved in mud. So long as man is in his childhood, God wills that\nhe shall be innocent.\n\nIf one were to ask that enormous city: “What is this?” she would reply:\n“It is my little one.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—SOME OF HIS PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS\n\n\nThe gamin—the street Arab—of Paris is the dwarf of the giant.\n\nLet us not exaggerate, this cherub of the gutter sometimes has a shirt,\nbut, in that case, he owns but one; he sometimes has shoes, but then\nthey have no soles; he sometimes has a lodging, and he loves it, for he\nfinds his mother there; but he prefers the street, because there he\nfinds liberty. He has his own games, his own bits of mischief, whose\nfoundation consists of hatred for the bourgeois; his peculiar\nmetaphors: to be dead is _to eat dandelions by the root_; his own\noccupations, calling hackney-coaches, letting down carriage-steps,\nestablishing means of transit between the two sides of a street in\nheavy rains, which he calls _making the bridge of arts_, crying\ndiscourses pronounced by the authorities in favor of the French people,\ncleaning out the cracks in the pavement; he has his own coinage, which\nis composed of all the little morsels of worked copper which are found\non the public streets. This curious money, which receives the name of\n_loques_—rags—has an invariable and well-regulated currency in this\nlittle Bohemia of children.\n\nLastly, he has his own fauna, which he observes attentively in the\ncorners; the lady-bird, the death’s-head plant-louse, the\ndaddy-long-legs, “the devil,” a black insect, which menaces by twisting\nabout its tail armed with two horns. He has his fabulous monster, which\nhas scales under its belly, but is not a lizard, which has pustules on\nits back, but is not a toad, which inhabits the nooks of old lime-kilns\nand wells that have run dry, which is black, hairy, sticky, which\ncrawls sometimes slowly, sometimes rapidly, which has no cry, but which\nhas a look, and is so terrible that no one has ever beheld it; he calls\nthis monster “the deaf thing.” The search for these “deaf things” among\nthe stones is a joy of formidable nature. Another pleasure consists in\nsuddenly prying up a paving-stone, and taking a look at the wood-lice.\nEach region of Paris is celebrated for the interesting treasures which\nare to be found there. There are ear-wigs in the timber-yards of the\nUrsulines, there are millepeds in the Pantheon, there are tadpoles in\nthe ditches of the Champs-de-Mars.\n\nAs far as sayings are concerned, this child has as many of them as\nTalleyrand. He is no less cynical, but he is more honest. He is endowed\nwith a certain indescribable, unexpected joviality; he upsets the\ncomposure of the shopkeeper with his wild laughter. He ranges boldly\nfrom high comedy to farce.\n\nA funeral passes by. Among those who accompany the dead there is a\ndoctor. “Hey there!” shouts some street Arab, “how long has it been\ncustomary for doctors to carry home their own work?”\n\n\nAnother is in a crowd. A grave man, adorned with spectacles and\ntrinkets, turns round indignantly: “You good-for-nothing, you have\nseized my wife’s waist!”—“I, sir? Search me!”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—HE IS AGREEABLE\n\n\nIn the evening, thanks to a few sous, which he always finds means to\nprocure, the _homuncio_ enters a theatre. On crossing that magic\nthreshold, he becomes transfigured; he was the street Arab, he becomes\nthe titi.18 Theatres are a sort of ship turned upside down with the\nkeel in the air. It is in that keel that the titi huddle together. The\ntiti is to the gamin what the moth is to the larva; the same being\nendowed with wings and soaring. It suffices for him to be there, with\nhis radiance of happiness, with his power of enthusiasm and joy, with\nhis hand-clapping, which resembles a clapping of wings, to confer on\nthat narrow, dark, fetid, sordid, unhealthy, hideous, abominable keel,\nthe name of Paradise.\n\nBestow on an individual the useless and deprive him of the necessary,\nand you have the gamin.\n\nThe gamin is not devoid of literary intuition. His tendency, and we say\nit with the proper amount of regret, would not constitute classic\ntaste. He is not very academic by nature. Thus, to give an example, the\npopularity of Mademoiselle Mars among that little audience of stormy\nchildren was seasoned with a touch of irony. The gamin called her\n_Mademoiselle Muche_—“hide yourself.”\n\n\nThis being bawls and scoffs and ridicules and fights, has rags like a\nbaby and tatters like a philosopher, fishes in the sewer, hunts in the\ncesspool, extracts mirth from foulness, whips up the squares with his\nwit, grins and bites, whistles and sings, shouts, and shrieks, tempers\nAlleluia with Matanturlurette, chants every rhythm from the De\nProfundis to the Jack-pudding, finds without seeking, knows what he is\nignorant of, is a Spartan to the point of thieving, is mad to wisdom,\nis lyrical to filth, would crouch down on Olympus, wallows in the\ndunghill and emerges from it covered with stars. The gamin of Paris is\nRabelais in this youth.\n\nHe is not content with his trousers unless they have a watch-pocket.\n\nHe is not easily astonished, he is still less easily terrified, he\nmakes songs on superstitions, he takes the wind out of exaggerations,\nhe twits mysteries, he thrusts out his tongue at ghosts, he takes the\npoetry out of stilted things, he introduces caricature into epic\nextravaganzas. It is not that he is prosaic; far from that; but he\nreplaces the solemn vision by the farcical phantasmagoria. If Adamastor\nwere to appear to him, the street Arab would say: “Hi there! The\nbugaboo!”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—HE MAY BE OF USE\n\n\nParis begins with the lounger and ends with the street Arab, two beings\nof which no other city is capable; the passive acceptance, which\ncontents itself with gazing, and the inexhaustible initiative;\nPrudhomme and Fouillou. Paris alone has this in its natural history.\nThe whole of the monarchy is contained in the lounger; the whole of\nanarchy in the gamin.\n\nThis pale child of the Parisian faubourgs lives and develops, makes\nconnections, “grows supple” in suffering, in the presence of social\nrealities and of human things, a thoughtful witness. He thinks himself\nheedless; and he is not. He looks and is on the verge of laughter; he\nis on the verge of something else also. Whoever you may be, if your\nname is Prejudice, Abuse, Ignorance, Oppression, Iniquity, Despotism,\nInjustice, Fanaticism, Tyranny, beware of the gaping gamin.\n\nThe little fellow will grow up.\n\nOf what clay is he made? Of the first mud that comes to hand. A handful\nof dirt, a breath, and behold Adam. It suffices for a God to pass by. A\nGod has always passed over the street Arab. Fortune labors at this tiny\nbeing. By the word “fortune” we mean chance, to some extent. That pigmy\nkneaded out of common earth, ignorant, unlettered, giddy, vulgar, low.\nWill that become an Ionian or a Bœotian? Wait, _currit rota_, the\nSpirit of Paris, that demon which creates the children of chance and\nthe men of destiny, reversing the process of the Latin potter, makes of\na jug an amphora.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—HIS FRONTIERS\n\n\nThe gamin loves the city, he also loves solitude, since he has\nsomething of the sage in him. _Urbis amator_, like Fuscus; _ruris\namator_, like Flaccus.\n\nTo roam thoughtfully about, that is to say, to lounge, is a fine\nemployment of time in the eyes of the philosopher; particularly in that\nrather illegitimate species of campaign, which is tolerably ugly but\nodd and composed of two natures, which surrounds certain great cities,\nnotably Paris. To study the suburbs is to study the amphibious animal.\nEnd of the trees, beginning of the roofs; end of the grass, beginning\nof the pavements; end of the furrows, beginning of the shops, end of\nthe wheel-ruts, beginning of the passions; end of the divine murmur,\nbeginning of the human uproar; hence an extraordinary interest.\n\nHence, in these not very attractive places, indelibly stamped by the\npassing stroller with the epithet: _melancholy_, the apparently\nobjectless promenades of the dreamer.\n\nHe who writes these lines has long been a prowler about the barriers of\nParis, and it is for him a source of profound souvenirs. That\nclose-shaven turf, those pebbly paths, that chalk, those pools, those\nharsh monotonies of waste and fallow lands, the plants of early\nmarket-garden suddenly springing into sight in a bottom, that mixture\nof the savage and the citizen, those vast desert nooks where the\ngarrison drums practise noisily, and produce a sort of lisping of\nbattle, those hermits by day and cut-throats by night, that clumsy mill\nwhich turns in the wind, the hoisting-wheels of the quarries, the\ntea-gardens at the corners of the cemeteries; the mysterious charm of\ngreat, sombre walls squarely intersecting immense, vague stretches of\nland inundated with sunshine and full of butterflies,—all this\nattracted him.\n\nThere is hardly any one on earth who is not acquainted with those\nsingular spots, the Glacière, the Cunette, the hideous wall of Grenelle\nall speckled with balls, Mont-Parnasse, the Fosse-aux-Loups, Aubiers on\nthe bank of the Marne, Mont-Souris, the Tombe-Issoire, the Pierre-Plate\nde Châtillon, where there is an old, exhausted quarry which no longer\nserves any purpose except to raise mushrooms, and which is closed, on a\nlevel with the ground, by a trap-door of rotten planks. The campagna of\nRome is one idea, the banlieue of Paris is another; to behold nothing\nbut fields, houses, or trees in what a stretch of country offers us, is\nto remain on the surface; all aspects of things are thoughts of God.\nThe spot where a plain effects its junction with a city is always\nstamped with a certain piercing melancholy. Nature and humanity both\nappeal to you at the same time there. Local originalities there make\ntheir appearance.\n\nAny one who, like ourselves, has wandered about in these solitudes\ncontiguous to our faubourgs, which may be designated as the limbos of\nParis, has seen here and there, in the most desert spot, at the most\nunexpected moment, behind a meagre hedge, or in the corner of a\nlugubrious wall, children grouped tumultuously, fetid, muddy, dusty,\nragged, dishevelled, playing hide-and-seek, and crowned with\ncorn-flowers. All of them are little ones who have made their escape\nfrom poor families. The outer boulevard is their breathing space; the\nsuburbs belong to them. There they are eternally playing truant. There\nthey innocently sing their repertory of dirty songs. There they are, or\nrather, there they exist, far from every eye, in the sweet light of May\nor June, kneeling round a hole in the ground, snapping marbles with\ntheir thumbs, quarrelling over half-farthings, irresponsible, volatile,\nfree and happy; and, no sooner do they catch sight of you than they\nrecollect that they have an industry, and that they must earn their\nliving, and they offer to sell you an old woollen stocking filled with\ncockchafers, or a bunch of lilacs. These encounters with strange\nchildren are one of the charming and at the same time poignant graces\nof the environs of Paris.\n\nSometimes there are little girls among the throng of boys,—are they\ntheir sisters?—who are almost young maidens, thin, feverish, with\nsunburnt hands, covered with freckles, crowned with poppies and ears of\nrye, gay, haggard, barefooted. They can be seen devouring cherries\namong the wheat. In the evening they can be heard laughing. These\ngroups, warmly illuminated by the full glow of midday, or indistinctly\nseen in the twilight, occupy the thoughtful man for a very long time,\nand these visions mingle with his dreams.\n\nParis, centre, banlieue, circumference; this constitutes all the earth\nto those children. They never venture beyond this. They can no more\nescape from the Parisian atmosphere than fish can escape from the\nwater. For them, nothing exists two leagues beyond the barriers: Ivry,\nGentilly, Arcueil, Belleville, Aubervilliers, Ménilmontant,\nChoisy-le-Roi, Billancourt, Meudon, Issy, Vanvre, Sèvres, Puteaux,\nNeuilly, Gennevilliers, Colombes, Romainville, Chatou, Asnières,\nBougival, Nanterre, Enghien, Noisy-le-Sec, Nogent, Gournay, Drancy,\nGonesse; the universe ends there.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—A BIT OF HISTORY\n\n\nAt the epoch, nearly contemporary by the way, when the action of this\nbook takes place, there was not, as there is to-day, a policeman at the\ncorner of every street (a benefit which there is no time to discuss\nhere); stray children abounded in Paris. The statistics give an average\nof two hundred and sixty homeless children picked up annually at that\nperiod, by the police patrols, in unenclosed lands, in houses in\nprocess of construction, and under the arches of the bridges. One of\nthese nests, which has become famous, produced “the swallows of the\nbridge of Arcola.” This is, moreover, the most disastrous of social\nsymptoms. All crimes of the man begin in the vagabondage of the child.\n\nLet us make an exception in favor of Paris, nevertheless. In a relative\nmeasure, and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled, the\nexception is just. While in any other great city the vagabond child is\na lost man, while nearly everywhere the child left to itself is, in\nsome sort, sacrificed and abandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in the\npublic vices which devour in him honesty and conscience, the street boy\nof Paris, we insist on this point, however defaced and injured on the\nsurface, is almost intact on the interior. It is a magnificent thing to\nput on record, and one which shines forth in the splendid probity of\nour popular revolutions, that a certain incorruptibility results from\nthe idea which exists in the air of Paris, as salt exists in the water\nof the ocean. To breathe Paris preserves the soul.\n\nWhat we have just said takes away nothing of the anguish of heart which\none experiences every time that one meets one of these children around\nwhom one fancies that he beholds floating the threads of a broken\nfamily. In the civilization of the present day, incomplete as it still\nis, it is not a very abnormal thing to behold these fractured families\npouring themselves out into the darkness, not knowing clearly what has\nbecome of their children, and allowing their own entrails to fall on\nthe public highway. Hence these obscure destinies. This is called, for\nthis sad thing has given rise to an expression, “to be cast on the\npavements of Paris.”\n\n\nLet it be said by the way, that this abandonment of children was not\ndiscouraged by the ancient monarchy. A little of Egypt and Bohemia in\nthe lower regions suited the upper spheres, and compassed the aims of\nthe powerful. The hatred of instruction for the children of the people\nwas a dogma. What is the use of “half-lights”? Such was the\ncountersign. Now, the erring child is the corollary of the ignorant\nchild.\n\nBesides this, the monarchy sometimes was in need of children, and in\nthat case it skimmed the streets.\n\nUnder Louis XIV., not to go any further back, the king rightly desired\nto create a fleet. The idea was a good one. But let us consider the\nmeans. There can be no fleet, if, beside the sailing ship, that\nplaything of the winds, and for the purpose of towing it, in case of\nnecessity, there is not the vessel which goes where it pleases, either\nby means of oars or of steam; the galleys were then to the marine what\nsteamers are to-day. Therefore, galleys were necessary; but the galley\nis moved only by the galley-slave; hence, galley-slaves were required.\nColbert had the commissioners of provinces and the parliaments make as\nmany convicts as possible. The magistracy showed a great deal of\ncomplaisance in the matter. A man kept his hat on in the presence of a\nprocession—it was a Huguenot attitude; he was sent to the galleys. A\nchild was encountered in the streets; provided that he was fifteen\nyears of age and did not know where he was to sleep, he was sent to the\ngalleys. Grand reign; grand century.\n\nUnder Louis XV. children disappeared in Paris; the police carried them\noff, for what mysterious purpose no one knew. People whispered with\nterror monstrous conjectures as to the king’s baths of purple. Barbier\nspeaks ingenuously of these things. It sometimes happened that the\nexempts of the guard, when they ran short of children, took those who\nhad fathers. The fathers, in despair, attacked the exempts. In that\ncase, the parliament intervened and had some one hung. Who? The\nexempts? No, the fathers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—THE GAMIN SHOULD HAVE HIS PLACE IN THE CLASSIFICATIONS OF\nINDIA\n\n\nThe body of street Arabs in Paris almost constitutes a caste. One might\nalmost say: Not every one who wishes to belong to it can do so.\n\nThis word _gamin_ was printed for the first time, and reached popular\nspeech through the literary tongue, in 1834. It is in a little work\nentitled _Claude Gueux_ that this word made its appearance. The horror\nwas lively. The word passed into circulation.\n\nThe elements which constitute the consideration of the gamins for each\nother are very various. We have known and associated with one who was\ngreatly respected and vastly admired because he had seen a man fall\nfrom the top of the tower of Notre-Dame; another, because he had\nsucceeded in making his way into the rear courtyard where the statues\nof the dome of the Invalides had been temporarily deposited, and had\n“prigged” some lead from them; a third, because he had seen a diligence\ntip over; still another, because he “knew” a soldier who came near\nputting out the eye of a citizen.\n\nThis explains that famous exclamation of a Parisian gamin, a profound\nepiphonema, which the vulgar herd laughs at without comprehending,—\n_Dieu de Dieu! What ill-luck I do have! to think that I have never yet\nseen anybody tumble from a fifth-story window! _ (_I have_ pronounced\n_I’ave_ and _fifth_ pronounced _fift’_.)\n\nSurely, this saying of a peasant is a fine one: “Father So-and-So, your\nwife has died of her malady; why did you not send for the doctor?”\n“What would you have, sir, we poor folks _die of ourselves_.” But if\nthe peasant’s whole passivity lies in this saying, the whole of the\nfree-thinking anarchy of the brat of the faubourgs is, assuredly,\ncontained in this other saying. A man condemned to death is listening\nto his confessor in the tumbrel. The child of Paris exclaims: “He is\ntalking to his black cap! Oh, the sneak!”\n\n\nA certain audacity on matters of religion sets off the gamin. To be\nstrong-minded is an important item.\n\nTo be present at executions constitutes a duty. He shows himself at the\nguillotine, and he laughs. He calls it by all sorts of pet names: The\nEnd of the Soup, The Growler, The Mother in the Blue (the sky), The\nLast Mouthful, etc., etc. In order not to lose anything of the affair,\nhe scales the walls, he hoists himself to balconies, he ascends trees,\nhe suspends himself to gratings, he clings fast to chimneys. The gamin\nis born a tiler as he is born a mariner. A roof inspires him with no\nmore fear than a mast. There is no festival which comes up to an\nexecution on the Place de Grève. Samson and the Abbé Montès are the\ntruly popular names. They hoot at the victim in order to encourage him.\nThey sometimes admire him. Lacenaire, when a gamin, on seeing the\nhideous Dautin die bravely, uttered these words which contain a future:\n“I was jealous of him.” In the brotherhood of gamins Voltaire is not\nknown, but Papavoine is. “Politicians” are confused with assassins in\nthe same legend. They have a tradition as to everybody’s last garment.\nIt is known that Tolleron had a fireman’s cap, Avril an otter cap,\nLosvel a round hat, that old Delaporte was bald and bareheaded, that\nCastaing was all ruddy and very handsome, that Bories had a romantic\nsmall beard, that Jean Martin kept on his suspenders, that Lecouffé and\nhis mother quarrelled. “Don’t reproach each other for your basket,”\nshouted a gamin to them. Another, in order to get a look at Debacker as\nhe passed, and being too small in the crowd, caught sight of the\nlantern on the quay and climbed it. A gendarme stationed opposite\nfrowned. “Let me climb up, m’sieu le gendarme,” said the gamin. And, to\nsoften the heart of the authorities he added: “I will not fall.” “I\ndon’t care if you do,” retorted the gendarme.\n\nIn the brotherhood of gamins, a memorable accident counts for a great\ndeal. One reaches the height of consideration if one chances to cut\none’s self very deeply, “to the very bone.”\n\n\nThe fist is no mediocre element of respect. One of the things that the\ngamin is fondest of saying is: “I am fine and strong, come now!” To be\nleft-handed renders you very enviable. A squint is highly esteemed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—IN WHICH THE READER WILL FIND A CHARMING SAYING OF THE\nLAST KING\n\n\nIn summer, he metamorphoses himself into a frog; and in the evening,\nwhen night is falling, in front of the bridges of Austerlitz and Jena,\nfrom the tops of coal wagons, and the washerwomen’s boats, he hurls\nhimself headlong into the Seine, and into all possible infractions of\nthe laws of modesty and of the police. Nevertheless the police keep an\neye on him, and the result is a highly dramatic situation which once\ngave rise to a fraternal and memorable cry; that cry which was\ncelebrated about 1830, is a strategic warning from gamin to gamin; it\nscans like a verse from Homer, with a notation as inexpressible as the\neleusiac chant of the Panathenæa, and in it one encounters again the\nancient Evohe. Here it is: “Ohé, Titi, ohééé! Here comes the bobby,\nhere comes the p’lice, pick up your duds and be off, through the sewer\nwith you!”\n\n\nSometimes this gnat—that is what he calls himself—knows how to read;\nsometimes he knows how to write; he always knows how to daub. He does\nnot hesitate to acquire, by no one knows what mysterious mutual\ninstruction, all the talents which can be of use to the public; from\n1815 to 1830, he imitated the cry of the turkey; from 1830 to 1848, he\nscrawled pears on the walls. One summer evening, when Louis Philippe\nwas returning home on foot, he saw a little fellow, no higher than his\nknee, perspiring and climbing up to draw a gigantic pear in charcoal on\none of the pillars of the gate of Neuilly; the King, with that\ngood-nature which came to him from Henry IV., helped the gamin,\nfinished the pear, and gave the child a louis, saying: “The pear is on\nthat also.\"19 The gamin loves uproar. A certain state of violence\npleases him. He execrates “the curés.” One day, in the Rue de\nl’Université, one of these scamps was putting his thumb to his nose at\nthe carriage gate of No. 69. “Why are you doing that at the gate?” a\npasser-by asked. The boy replied: “There is a curé there.” It was\nthere, in fact, that the Papal Nuncio lived.\n\nNevertheless, whatever may be the Voltairianism of the small gamin, if\nthe occasion to become a chorister presents itself, it is quite\npossible that he will accept, and in that case he serves the mass\ncivilly. There are two things to which he plays Tantalus, and which he\nalways desires without ever attaining them: to overthrow the\ngovernment, and to get his trousers sewed up again.\n\nThe gamin in his perfect state possesses all the policemen of Paris,\nand can always put the name to the face of any one which he chances to\nmeet. He can tell them off on the tips of his fingers. He studies their\nhabits, and he has special notes on each one of them. He reads the\nsouls of the police like an open book. He will tell you fluently and\nwithout flinching: “Such an one is a _traitor_; such another is very\n_malicious_; such another is _great_; such another is _ridiculous_.”\n(All these words: traitor, malicious, great, ridiculous, have a\nparticular meaning in his mouth.) That one imagines that he owns the\nPont-Neuf, and he prevents _people_ from walking on the cornice outside\nthe parapet; that other has a mania for pulling _person’s_ ears; etc.,\netc.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—THE OLD SOUL OF GAUL\n\n\nThere was something of that boy in Poquelin, the son of the\nfish-market; Beaumarchais had something of it. Gaminerie is a shade of\nthe Gallic spirit. Mingled with good sense, it sometimes adds force to\nthe latter, as alcohol does to wine. Sometimes it is a defect. Homer\nrepeats himself eternally, granted; one may say that Voltaire plays the\ngamin. Camille Desmoulins was a native of the faubourgs. Championnet,\nwho treated miracles brutally, rose from the pavements of Paris; he\nhad, when a small lad, inundated the porticos of Saint-Jean de\nBeauvais, and of Saint-Étienne du Mont; he had addressed the shrine of\nSainte-Geneviève familiarly to give orders to the phial of Saint\nJanuarius.\n\nThe gamin of Paris is respectful, ironical, and insolent. He has\nvillainous teeth, because he is badly fed and his stomach suffers, and\nhandsome eyes because he has wit. If Jehovah himself were present, he\nwould go hopping up the steps of paradise on one foot. He is strong on\nboxing. All beliefs are possible to him. He plays in the gutter, and\nstraightens himself up with a revolt; his effrontery persists even in\nthe presence of grape-shot; he was a scapegrace, he is a hero; like the\nlittle Theban, he shakes the skin from the lion; Barra the drummer-boy\nwas a gamin of Paris; he Shouts: “Forward!” as the horse of Scripture\nsays “Vah!” and in a moment he has passed from the small brat to the\ngiant.\n\nThis child of the puddle is also the child of the ideal. Measure that\nspread of wings which reaches from Molière to Barra.\n\nTo sum up the whole, and in one word, the gamin is a being who amuses\nhimself, because he is unhappy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X—ECCE PARIS, ECCE HOMO\n\n\nTo sum it all up once more, the Paris gamin of to-day, like the\n_græculus_ of Rome in days gone by, is the infant populace with the\nwrinkle of the old world on his brow.\n\nThe gamin is a grace to the nation, and at the same time a disease; a\ndisease which must be cured, how? By light.\n\nLight renders healthy.\n\nLight kindles.\n\nAll generous social irradiations spring from science, letters, arts,\neducation. Make men, make men. Give them light that they may warm you.\nSooner or later the splendid question of universal education will\npresent itself with the irresistible authority of the absolute truth;\nand then, those who govern under the superintendence of the French idea\nwill have to make this choice; the children of France or the gamins of\nParis; flames in the light or will-o’-the-wisps in the gloom.\n\nThe gamin expresses Paris, and Paris expresses the world.\n\nFor Paris is a total. Paris is the ceiling of the human race. The whole\nof this prodigious city is a foreshortening of dead manners and living\nmanners. He who sees Paris thinks he sees the bottom of all history\nwith heaven and constellations in the intervals. Paris has a capital,\nthe Town-Hall, a Parthenon, Notre-Dame, a Mount Aventine, the Faubourg\nSaint-Antoine, an Asinarium, the Sorbonne, a Pantheon, the Pantheon, a\nVia Sacra, the Boulevard des Italiens, a temple of the winds, opinion;\nand it replaces the Gemoniæ by ridicule. Its _majo_ is called “faraud,”\nits Transteverin is the man of the faubourgs, its _hammal_ is the\nmarket-porter, its lazzarone is the pègre, its cockney is the native of\nGhent. Everything that exists elsewhere exists at Paris. The fishwoman\nof Dumarsais can retort on the herb-seller of Euripides, the discobols\nVejanus lives again in the Forioso, the tight-rope dancer.\nTherapontigonus Miles could walk arm in arm with Vadeboncœur the\ngrenadier, Damasippus the second-hand dealer would be happy among\nbric-à-brac merchants, Vincennes could grasp Socrates in its fist as\njust as Agora could imprison Diderot, Grimod de la Reynière discovered\nlarded roast beef, as Curtillus invented roast hedgehog, we see the\ntrapeze which figures in Plautus reappear under the vault of the Arc of\nl’Etoile, the sword-eater of Pœcilus encountered by Apuleius is a\nsword-swallower on the Pont-Neuf, the nephew of Rameau and Curculio the\nparasite make a pair, Ergasilus could get himself presented to\nCambacères by d’Aigrefeuille; the four dandies of Rome: Alcesimarchus,\nPhœdromus, Diabolus, and Argyrippus, descend from Courtille in\nLabatut’s posting-chaise; Aulus Gellius would halt no longer in front\nof Congrio than would Charles Nodier in front of Punchinello; Marto is\nnot a tigress, but Pardalisca was not a dragon; Pantolabus the wag\njeers in the Café Anglais at Nomentanus the fast liver, Hermogenus is a\ntenor in the Champs-Élysées, and round him, Thracius the beggar, clad\nlike Bobèche, takes up a collection; the bore who stops you by the\nbutton of your coat in the Tuileries makes you repeat after a lapse of\ntwo thousand years Thesprion’s apostrophe: _Quis properantem me\nprehendit pallio? _ The wine on Surêne is a parody of the wine of Alba,\nthe red border of Desaugiers forms a balance to the great cutting of\nBalatro, Père-Lachaise exhales beneath nocturnal rains the same gleams\nas the Esquiliæ, and the grave of the poor bought for five years, is\ncertainly the equivalent of the slave’s hived coffin.\n\nSeek something that Paris has not. The vat of Trophonius contains\nnothing that is not in Mesmer’s tub; Ergaphilas lives again in\nCagliostro; the Brahmin Vâsaphantâ become incarnate in the Comte de\nSaint-Germain; the cemetery of Saint-Médard works quite as good\nmiracles as the Mosque of Oumoumié at Damascus.\n\nParis has an Æsop-Mayeux, and a Canidia, Mademoiselle Lenormand. It is\nterrified, like Delphos at the fulgurating realities of the vision; it\nmakes tables turn as Dodona did tripods. It places the grisette on the\nthrone, as Rome placed the courtesan there; and, taking it altogether,\nif Louis XV. is worse than Claudian, Madame Dubarry is better than\nMessalina. Paris combines in an unprecedented type, which has existed\nand which we have elbowed, Grecian nudity, the Hebraic ulcer, and the\nGascon pun. It mingles Diogenes, Job, and Jack-pudding, dresses up a\nspectre in old numbers of the _Constitutional_, and makes Chodruc\nDuclos.\n\nAlthough Plutarch says: _the tyrant never grows old_, Rome, under Sylla\nas under Domitian, resigned itself and willingly put water in its wine.\nThe Tiber was a Lethe, if the rather doctrinary eulogium made of it by\nVarus Vibiscus is to be credited: _Contra Gracchos Tiberim habemus,\nBibere Tiberim, id est seditionem oblivisci_. Paris drinks a million\nlitres of water a day, but that does not prevent it from occasionally\nbeating the general alarm and ringing the tocsin.\n\nWith that exception, Paris is amiable. It accepts everything royally;\nit is not too particular about its Venus; its Callipyge is Hottentot;\nprovided that it is made to laugh, it condones; ugliness cheers it,\ndeformity provokes it to laughter, vice diverts it; be eccentric and\nyou may be an eccentric; even hypocrisy, that supreme cynicism, does\nnot disgust it; it is so literary that it does not hold its nose before\nBasile, and is no more scandalized by the prayer of Tartuffe than\nHorace was repelled by the “hiccup” of Priapus. No trait of the\nuniversal face is lacking in the profile of Paris. The bal Mabile is\nnot the polymnia dance of the Janiculum, but the dealer in ladies’\nwearing apparel there devours the lorette with her eyes, exactly as the\nprocuress Staphyla lay in wait for the virgin Planesium. The Barrière\ndu Combat is not the Coliseum, but people are as ferocious there as\nthough Cæsar were looking on. The Syrian hostess has more grace than\nMother Saguet, but, if Virgil haunted the Roman wine-shop, David\nd’Angers, Balzac and Charlet have sat at the tables of Parisian\ntaverns. Paris reigns. Geniuses flash forth there, the red tails\nprosper there. Adonaï passes on his chariot with its twelve wheels of\nthunder and lightning; Silenus makes his entry there on his ass. For\nSilenus read Ramponneau.\n\nParis is the synonym of Cosmos, Paris is Athens, Sybaris, Jerusalem,\nPantin. All civilizations are there in an abridged form, all barbarisms\nalso. Paris would greatly regret it if it had not a guillotine.\n\nA little of the Place de Grève is a good thing. What would all that\neternal festival be without this seasoning? Our laws are wisely\nprovided, and thanks to them, this blade drips on this Shrove Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI—TO SCOFF, TO REIGN\n\n\nThere is no limit to Paris. No city has had that domination which\nsometimes derides those whom it subjugates. To please you, O Athenians!\nexclaimed Alexander. Paris makes more than the law, it makes the\nfashion; Paris sets more than the fashion, it sets the routine. Paris\nmay be stupid, if it sees fit; it sometimes allows itself this luxury;\nthen the universe is stupid in company with it; then Paris awakes, rubs\nits eyes, says: “How stupid I am!” and bursts out laughing in the face\nof the human race. What a marvel is such a city! it is a strange thing\nthat this grandioseness and this burlesque should be amicable\nneighbors, that all this majesty should not be thrown into disorder by\nall this parody, and that the same mouth can to-day blow into the trump\nof the Judgment Day, and to-morrow into the reed-flute! Paris has a\nsovereign joviality. Its gayety is of the thunder and its farce holds a\nsceptre.\n\nIts tempest sometimes proceeds from a grimace. Its explosions, its\ndays, its masterpieces, its prodigies, its epics, go forth to the\nbounds of the universe, and so also do its cock-and-bull stories. Its\nlaugh is the mouth of a volcano which spatters the whole earth. Its\njests are sparks. It imposes its caricatures as well as its ideal on\npeople; the highest monuments of human civilization accept its ironies\nand lend their eternity to its mischievous pranks. It is superb; it has\na prodigious 14th of July, which delivers the globe; it forces all\nnations to take the oath of tennis; its night of the 4th of August\ndissolves in three hours a thousand years of feudalism; it makes of its\nlogic the muscle of unanimous will; it multiplies itself under all\nsorts of forms of the sublime; it fills with its light Washington,\nKosciusko, Bolivar, Bozzaris, Riego, Bem, Manin, Lopez, John Brown,\nGaribaldi; it is everywhere where the future is being lighted up, at\nBoston in 1779, at the Isle de Léon in 1820, at Pesth in 1848, at\nPalermo in 1860, it whispers the mighty countersign: Liberty, in the\near of the American abolitionists grouped about the boat at Harper’s\nFerry, and in the ear of the patriots of Ancona assembled in the\nshadow, to the Archi before the Gozzi inn on the seashore; it creates\nCanaris; it creates Quiroga; it creates Pisacane; it irradiates the\ngreat on earth; it was while proceeding whither its breath urge them,\nthat Byron perished at Missolonghi, and that Mazet died at Barcelona;\nit is the tribune under the feet of Mirabeau, and a crater under the\nfeet of Robespierre; its books, its theatre, its art, its science, its\nliterature, its philosophy, are the manuals of the human race; it has\nPascal, Régnier, Corneille, Descartes, Jean-Jacques: Voltaire for all\nmoments, Molière for all centuries; it makes its language to be talked\nby the universal mouth, and that language becomes the word; it\nconstructs in all minds the idea of progress, the liberating dogmas\nwhich it forges are for the generations trusty friends, and it is with\nthe soul of its thinkers and its poets that all heroes of all nations\nhave been made since 1789; this does not prevent vagabondism, and that\nenormous genius which is called Paris, while transfiguring the world by\nits light, sketches in charcoal Bouginier’s nose on the wall of the\ntemple of Theseus and writes _Credeville the thief_ on the Pyramids.\n\nParis is always showing its teeth; when it is not scolding it is\nlaughing.\n\nSuch is Paris. The smoke of its roofs forms the ideas of the universe.\nA heap of mud and stone, if you will, but, above all, a moral being. It\nis more than great, it is immense. Why? Because it is daring.\n\nTo dare; that is the price of progress.\n\nAll sublime conquests are, more or less, the prizes of daring. In order\nthat the Revolution should take place, it does not suffice that\nMontesquieu should foresee it, that Diderot should preach it, that\nBeaumarchais should announce it, that Condorcet should calculate it,\nthat Arouet should prepare it, that Rousseau should premeditate it; it\nis necessary that Danton should dare it.\n\nThe cry: _Audacity! _ is a _Fiat lux_. It is necessary, for the sake of\nthe forward march of the human race, that there should be proud lessons\nof courage permanently on the heights. Daring deeds dazzle history and\nare one of man’s great sources of light. The dawn dares when it rises.\nTo attempt, to brave, to persist, to persevere, to be faithful to one’s\nself, to grasp fate bodily, to astound catastrophe by the small amount\nof fear that it occasions us, now to affront unjust power, again to\ninsult drunken victory, to hold one’s position, to stand one’s ground;\nthat is the example which nations need, that is the light which\nelectrifies them. The same formidable lightning proceeds from the torch\nof Prometheus to Cambronne’s short pipe.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII—THE FUTURE LATENT IN THE PEOPLE\n\n\nAs for the Parisian populace, even when a man grown, it is always the\nstreet Arab; to paint the child is to paint the city; and it is for\nthat reason that we have studied this eagle in this arrant sparrow. It\nis in the faubourgs, above all, we maintain, that the Parisian race\nappears; there is the pure blood; there is the true physiognomy; there\nthis people toils and suffers, and suffering and toil are the two faces\nof man. There exist there immense numbers of unknown beings, among whom\nswarm types of the strangest, from the porter of la Râpée to the\nknacker of Montfaucon. _Fex urbis_, exclaims Cicero; _mob_, adds Burke,\nindignantly; rabble, multitude, populace. These are words and quickly\nuttered. But so be it. What does it matter? What is it to me if they do\ngo barefoot! They do not know how to read; so much the worse. Would you\nabandon them for that? Would you turn their distress into a\nmalediction? Cannot the light penetrate these masses? Let us return to\nthat cry: Light! and let us obstinately persist therein! Light! Light!\nWho knows whether these opacities will not become transparent? Are not\nrevolutions transfigurations? Come, philosophers, teach, enlighten,\nlight up, think aloud, speak aloud, hasten joyously to the great sun,\nfraternize with the public place, announce the good news, spend your\nalphabets lavishly, proclaim rights, sing the Marseillaises, sow\nenthusiasms, tear green boughs from the oaks. Make a whirlwind of the\nidea. This crowd may be rendered sublime. Let us learn how to make use\nof that vast conflagration of principles and virtues, which sparkles,\nbursts forth and quivers at certain hours. These bare feet, these bare\narms, these rags, these ignorances, these abjectnesses, these\ndarknesses, may be employed in the conquest of the ideal. Gaze past the\npeople, and you will perceive truth. Let that vile sand which you\ntrample under foot be cast into the furnace, let it melt and seethe\nthere, it will become a splendid crystal, and it is thanks to it that\nGalileo and Newton will discover stars.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII—LITTLE GAVROCHE\n\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nLittle Gavroche  3b1-13-gavroche\n\n\nEight or nine years after the events narrated in the second part of\nthis story, people noticed on the Boulevard du Temple, and in the\nregions of the Château-d’Eau, a little boy eleven or twelve years of\nage, who would have realized with tolerable accuracy that ideal of the\ngamin sketched out above, if, with the laugh of his age on his lips, he\nhad not had a heart absolutely sombre and empty. This child was well\nmuffled up in a pair of man’s trousers, but he did not get them from\nhis father, and a woman’s chemise, but he did not get it from his\nmother. Some people or other had clothed him in rags out of charity.\nStill, he had a father and a mother. But his father did not think of\nhim, and his mother did not love him.\n\nHe was one of those children most deserving of pity, among all, one of\nthose who have father and mother, and who are orphans nevertheless.\n\nThis child never felt so well as when he was in the street. The\npavements were less hard to him than his mother’s heart.\n\nHis parents had despatched him into life with a kick.\n\nHe simply took flight.\n\nHe was a boisterous, pallid, nimble, wide-awake, jeering, lad, with a\nvivacious but sickly air. He went and came, sang, played at hopscotch,\nscraped the gutters, stole a little, but, like cats and sparrows, gayly\nlaughed when he was called a rogue, and got angry when called a thief.\nHe had no shelter, no bread, no fire, no love; but he was merry because\nhe was free.\n\nWhen these poor creatures grow to be men, the millstones of the social\norder meet them and crush them, but so long as they are children, they\nescape because of their smallness. The tiniest hole saves them.\n\nNevertheless, abandoned as this child was, it sometimes happened, every\ntwo or three months, that he said, “Come, I’ll go and see mamma!” Then\nhe quitted the boulevard, the Cirque, the Porte Saint-Martin, descended\nto the quays, crossed the bridges, reached the suburbs, arrived at the\nSalpêtrière, and came to a halt, where? Precisely at that double number\n50-52 with which the reader is acquainted—at the Gorbeau hovel.\n\nAt that epoch, the hovel 50-52 generally deserted and eternally\ndecorated with the placard: “Chambers to let,” chanced to be, a rare\nthing, inhabited by numerous individuals who, however, as is always the\ncase in Paris, had no connection with each other. All belonged to that\nindigent class which begins to separate from the lowest of petty\nbourgeoisie in straitened circumstances, and which extends from misery\nto misery into the lowest depths of society down to those two beings in\nwhom all the material things of civilization end, the sewer-man who\nsweeps up the mud, and the rag-picker who collects scraps.\n\nThe “principal lodger” of Jean Valjean’s day was dead and had been\nreplaced by another exactly like her. I know not what philosopher has\nsaid: “Old women are never lacking.”\n\n\nThis new old woman was named Madame Bourgon, and had nothing remarkable\nabout her life except a dynasty of three paroquets, who had reigned in\nsuccession over her soul.\n\nThe most miserable of those who inhabited the hovel were a family of\nfour persons, consisting of father, mother, and two daughters, already\nwell grown, all four of whom were lodged in the same attic, one of the\ncells which we have already mentioned.\n\nAt first sight, this family presented no very special feature except\nits extreme destitution; the father, when he hired the chamber, had\nstated that his name was Jondrette. Some time after his moving in,\nwhich had borne a singular resemblance to _the entrance of nothing at\nall_, to borrow the memorable expression of the principal tenant, this\nJondrette had said to the woman, who, like her predecessor, was at the\nsame time portress and stair-sweeper: “Mother So-and-So, if any one\nshould chance to come and inquire for a Pole or an Italian, or even a\nSpaniard, perchance, it is I.”\n\n\nThis family was that of the merry barefoot boy. He arrived there and\nfound distress, and, what is still sadder, no smile; a cold hearth and\ncold hearts. When he entered, he was asked: “Whence come you?” He\nreplied: “From the street.” When he went away, they asked him: “Whither\nare you going?” He replied: “Into the streets.” His mother said to him:\n“What did you come here for?”\n\n\nThis child lived, in this absence of affection, like the pale plants\nwhich spring up in cellars. It did not cause him suffering, and he\nblamed no one. He did not know exactly how a father and mother should\nbe.\n\nNevertheless, his mother loved his sisters.\n\nWe have forgotten to mention, that on the Boulevard du Temple this\nchild was called Little Gavroche. Why was he called Little Gavroche?\n\nProbably because his father’s name was Jondrette.\n\nIt seems to be the instinct of certain wretched families to break the\nthread.\n\nThe chamber which the Jondrettes inhabited in the Gorbeau hovel was the\nlast at the end of the corridor. The cell next to it was occupied by a\nvery poor young man who was called M. Marius.\n\nLet us explain who this M. Marius was.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SECOND—THE GREAT BOURGEOIS\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—NINETY YEARS AND THIRTY-TWO TEETH\n\n\nIn the Rue Boucherat, Rue de Normandie and the Rue de Saintonge there\nstill exist a few ancient inhabitants who have preserved the memory of\na worthy man named M. Gillenormand, and who mention him with\ncomplaisance. This good man was old when they were young. This\nsilhouette has not yet entirely disappeared—for those who regard with\nmelancholy that vague swarm of shadows which is called the past—from\nthe labyrinth of streets in the vicinity of the Temple to which, under\nLouis XIV., the names of all the provinces of France were appended\nexactly as in our day, the streets of the new Tivoli quarter have\nreceived the names of all the capitals of Europe; a progression, by the\nway, in which progress is visible.\n\nM. Gillenormand, who was as much alive as possible in 1831, was one of\nthose men who had become curiosities to be viewed, simply because they\nhave lived a long time, and who are strange because they formerly\nresembled everybody, and now resemble nobody. He was a peculiar old\nman, and in very truth, a man of another age, the real, complete and\nrather haughty bourgeois of the eighteenth century, who wore his good,\nold bourgeoisie with the air with which marquises wear their\nmarquisates. He was over ninety years of age, his walk was erect, he\ntalked loudly, saw clearly, drank neat, ate, slept, and snored. He had\nall thirty-two of his teeth. He only wore spectacles when he read. He\nwas of an amorous disposition, but declared that, for the last ten\nyears, he had wholly and decidedly renounced women. He could no longer\nplease, he said; he did not add: “I am too old,” but: “I am too poor.”\nHe said: “If I were not ruined—Héée!” All he had left, in fact, was an\nincome of about fifteen thousand francs. His dream was to come into an\ninheritance and to have a hundred thousand livres income for\nmistresses. He did not belong, as the reader will perceive, to that\npuny variety of octogenaries who, like M. de Voltaire, have been dying\nall their life; his was no longevity of a cracked pot; this jovial old\nman had always had good health. He was superficial, rapid, easily\nangered. He flew into a passion at everything, generally quite contrary\nto all reason. When contradicted, he raised his cane; he beat people as\nhe had done in the great century. He had a daughter over fifty years of\nage, and unmarried, whom he chastised severely with his tongue, when in\na rage, and whom he would have liked to whip. She seemed to him to be\neight years old. He boxed his servants’ ears soundly, and said: “Ah!\ncarogne!” One of his oaths was: “By the pantoufloche of the\npantouflochade!” He had singular freaks of tranquillity; he had himself\nshaved every day by a barber who had been mad and who detested him,\nbeing jealous of M. Gillenormand on account of his wife, a pretty and\ncoquettish barberess. M. Gillenormand admired his own discernment in\nall things, and declared that he was extremely sagacious; here is one\nof his sayings: “I have, in truth, some penetration; I am able to say\nwhen a flea bites me, from what woman it came.”\n\n\nThe words which he uttered the most frequently were: _the sensible\nman_, and _nature_. He did not give to this last word the grand\nacceptation which our epoch has accorded to it, but he made it enter,\nafter his own fashion, into his little chimney-corner satires:\n“Nature,” he said, “in order that civilization may have a little of\neverything, gives it even specimens of its amusing barbarism. Europe\npossesses specimens of Asia and Africa on a small scale. The cat is a\ndrawing-room tiger, the lizard is a pocket crocodile. The dancers at\nthe opera are pink female savages. They do not eat men, they crunch\nthem; or, magicians that they are, they transform them into oysters and\nswallow them. The Caribbeans leave only the bones, they leave only the\nshell. Such are our morals. We do not devour, we gnaw; we do not\nexterminate, we claw.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—LIKE MASTER, LIKE HOUSE\n\n\nHe lived in the Marais, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6. He owned the\nhouse. This house has since been demolished and rebuilt, and the number\nhas probably been changed in those revolutions of numeration which the\nstreets of Paris undergo. He occupied an ancient and vast apartment on\nthe first floor, between street and gardens, furnished to the very\nceilings with great Gobelins and Beauvais tapestries representing\npastoral scenes; the subjects of the ceilings and the panels were\nrepeated in miniature on the armchairs. He enveloped his bed in a vast,\nnine-leaved screen of Coromandel lacquer. Long, full curtains hung from\nthe windows, and formed great, broken folds that were very magnificent.\nThe garden situated immediately under his windows was attached to that\none of them which formed the angle, by means of a staircase twelve or\nfifteen steps long, which the old gentleman ascended and descended with\ngreat agility. In addition to a library adjoining his chamber, he had a\nboudoir of which he thought a great deal, a gallant and elegant\nretreat, with magnificent hangings of straw, with a pattern of flowers\nand fleurs-de-lys made on the galleys of Louis XIV. and ordered of his\nconvicts by M. de Vivonne for his mistress. M. Gillenormand had\ninherited it from a grim maternal great-aunt, who had died a\ncentenarian. He had had two wives. His manners were something between\nthose of the courtier, which he had never been, and the lawyer, which\nhe might have been. He was gay, and caressing when he had a mind. In\nhis youth he had been one of those men who are always deceived by their\nwives and never by their mistresses, because they are, at the same\ntime, the most sullen of husbands and the most charming of lovers in\nexistence. He was a connoisseur of painting. He had in his chamber a\nmarvellous portrait of no one knows whom, painted by Jordaens, executed\nwith great dashes of the brush, with millions of details, in a confused\nand hap-hazard manner. M. Gillenormand’s attire was not the habit of\nLouis XIV. nor yet that of Louis XVI.; it was that of the Incroyables\nof the Directory. He had thought himself young up to that period and\nhad followed the fashions. His coat was of light-weight cloth with\nvoluminous revers, a long swallow-tail and large steel buttons. With\nthis he wore knee-breeches and buckle shoes. He always thrust his hands\ninto his fobs. He said authoritatively: “The French Revolution is a\nheap of blackguards.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—LUC-ESPRIT\n\n\nAt the age of sixteen, one evening at the opera, he had had the honor\nto be stared at through opera-glasses by two beauties at the same\ntime—ripe and celebrated beauties then, and sung by Voltaire, the\nCamargo and the Sallé. Caught between two fires, he had beaten a heroic\nretreat towards a little dancer, a young girl named Nahenry, who was\nsixteen like himself, obscure as a cat, and with whom he was in love.\nHe abounded in memories. He was accustomed to exclaim: “How pretty she\nwas—that Guimard-Guimardini-Guimardinette, the last time I saw her at\nLongchamps, her hair curled in sustained sentiments, with her\ncome-and-see of turquoises, her gown of the color of persons newly\narrived, and her little agitation muff!” He had worn in his young\nmanhood a waistcoat of Nain-Londrin, which he was fond of talking about\neffusively. “I was dressed like a Turk of the Levant Levantin,” said\nhe. Madame de Boufflers, having seen him by chance when he was twenty,\nhad described him as “a charming fool.” He was horrified by all the\nnames which he saw in politics and in power, regarding them as vulgar\nand bourgeois. He read the journals, the _newspapers, the gazettes_ as\nhe said, stifling outbursts of laughter the while. “Oh!” he said, “what\npeople these are! Corbière! Humann! Casimir Périer! There’s a minister\nfor you! I can imagine this in a journal: ‘M. Gillenorman, minister!’\nthat would be a farce. Well! They are so stupid that it would pass”; he\nmerrily called everything by its name, whether decent or indecent, and\ndid not restrain himself in the least before ladies. He uttered coarse\nspeeches, obscenities, and filth with a certain tranquillity and lack\nof astonishment which was elegant. It was in keeping with the\nunceremoniousness of his century. It is to be noted that the age of\nperiphrase in verse was the age of crudities in prose. His god-father\nhad predicted that he would turn out a man of genius, and had bestowed\non him these two significant names: Luc-Esprit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—A CENTENARIAN ASPIRANT\n\n\nHe had taken prizes in his boyhood at the College of Moulins, where he\nwas born, and he had been crowned by the hand of the Duc de Nivernais,\nwhom he called the Duc de Nevers. Neither the Convention, nor the death\nof Louis XVI., nor the Napoleon, nor the return of the Bourbons, nor\nanything else had been able to efface the memory of this crowning. _The\nDuc de Nevers_ was, in his eyes, the great figure of the century. “What\na charming grand seigneur,” he said, “and what a fine air he had with\nhis blue ribbon!”\n\n\nIn the eyes of M. Gillenormand, Catherine the Second had made\nreparation for the crime of the partition of Poland by purchasing, for\nthree thousand roubles, the secret of the elixir of gold, from\nBestucheff. He grew animated on this subject: “The elixir of gold,” he\nexclaimed, “the yellow dye of Bestucheff, General Lamotte’s drops, in\nthe eighteenth century,—this was the great remedy for the catastrophes\nof love, the panacea against Venus, at one louis the half-ounce phial.\nLouis XV. sent two hundred phials of it to the Pope.” He would have\nbeen greatly irritated and thrown off his balance, had any one told him\nthat the elixir of gold is nothing but the perchloride of iron. M.\nGillenormand adored the Bourbons, and had a horror of 1789; he was\nforever narrating in what manner he had saved himself during the\nTerror, and how he had been obliged to display a vast deal of gayety\nand cleverness in order to escape having his head cut off. If any young\nman ventured to pronounce an eulogium on the Republic in his presence,\nhe turned purple and grew so angry that he was on the point of\nswooning. He sometimes alluded to his ninety years, and said, “I hope\nthat I shall not see ninety-three twice.” On these occasions, he hinted\nto people that he meant to live to be a hundred.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—BASQUE AND NICOLETTE\n\n\nHe had theories. Here is one of them: “When a man is passionately fond\nof women, and when he has himself a wife for whom he cares but little,\nwho is homely, cross, legitimate, with plenty of rights, perched on the\ncode, and jealous at need, there is but one way of extricating himself\nfrom the quandry and of procuring peace, and that is to let his wife\ncontrol the purse-strings. This abdication sets him free. Then his wife\nbusies herself, grows passionately fond of handling coin, gets her\nfingers covered with verdigris in the process, undertakes the education\nof half-share tenants and the training of farmers, convokes lawyers,\npresides over notaries, harangues scriveners, visits limbs of the law,\nfollows lawsuits, draws up leases, dictates contracts, feels herself\nthe sovereign, sells, buys, regulates, promises and compromises, binds\nfast and annuls, yields, concedes and retrocedes, arranges,\ndisarranges, hoards, lavishes; she commits follies, a supreme and\npersonal delight, and that consoles her. While her husband disdains\nher, she has the satisfaction of ruining her husband.” This theory M.\nGillenormand had himself applied, and it had become his history. His\nwife—the second one—had administered his fortune in such a manner that,\none fine day, when M. Gillenormand found himself a widower, there\nremained to him just sufficient to live on, by sinking nearly the whole\nof it in an annuity of fifteen thousand francs, three-quarters of which\nwould expire with him. He had not hesitated on this point, not being\nanxious to leave a property behind him. Besides, he had noticed that\npatrimonies are subject to adventures, and, for instance, become\n_national property_; he had been present at the avatars of consolidated\nthree per cents, and he had no great faith in the Great Book of the\nPublic Debt. “All that’s the Rue Quincampois!” he said. His house in\nthe Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire belonged to him, as we have already\nstated. He had two servants, “a male and a female.” When a servant\nentered his establishment, M. Gillenormand re-baptized him. He bestowed\non the men the name of their province: Nîmois, Comtois, Poitevin,\nPicard. His last valet was a big, foundered, short-winded fellow of\nfifty-five, who was incapable of running twenty paces; but, as he had\nbeen born at Bayonne, M. Gillenormand called him _Basque_. All the\nfemale servants in his house were called Nicolette (even the Magnon, of\nwhom we shall hear more farther on). One day, a haughty cook, a cordon\nbleu, of the lofty race of porters, presented herself. “How much wages\ndo you want a month?” asked M. Gillenormand. “Thirty francs.” “What is\nyour name?” “Olympie.” “You shall have fifty francs, and you shall be\ncalled Nicolette.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—IN WHICH MAGNON AND HER TWO CHILDREN ARE SEEN\n\n\nWith M. Gillenormand, sorrow was converted into wrath; he was furious\nat being in despair. He had all sorts of prejudices and took all sorts\nof liberties. One of the facts of which his exterior relief and his\ninternal satisfaction was composed, was, as we have just hinted, that\nhe had remained a brisk spark, and that he passed energetically for\nsuch. This he called having “royal renown.” This royal renown sometimes\ndrew down upon him singular windfalls. One day, there was brought to\nhim in a basket, as though it had been a basket of oysters, a stout,\nnewly born boy, who was yelling like the deuce, and duly wrapped in\nswaddling-clothes, which a servant-maid, dismissed six months\npreviously, attributed to him. M. Gillenormand had, at that time, fully\ncompleted his eighty-fourth year. Indignation and uproar in the\nestablishment. And whom did that bold hussy think she could persuade to\nbelieve that? What audacity! What an abominable calumny! M.\nGillenormand himself was not at all enraged. He gazed at the brat with\nthe amiable smile of a good man who is flattered by the calumny, and\nsaid in an aside: “Well, what now? What’s the matter? You are finely\ntaken aback, and really, you are excessively ignorant. M. le Duc\nd’Angoulême, the bastard of his Majesty Charles IX., married a silly\njade of fifteen when he was eighty-five; M. Virginal, Marquis d’Alluye,\nbrother to the Cardinal de Sourdis, Archbishop of Bordeaux, had, at the\nage of eighty-three, by the maid of Madame la Présidente Jacquin, a\nson, a real child of love, who became a Chevalier of Malta and a\ncounsellor of state; one of the great men of this century, the Abbé\nTabaraud, is the son of a man of eighty-seven. There is nothing out of\nthe ordinary in these things. And then, the Bible! Upon that I declare\nthat this little gentleman is none of mine. Let him be taken care of.\nIt is not his fault.” This manner of procedure was good-tempered. The\nwoman, whose name was Magnon, sent him another parcel in the following\nyear. It was a boy again. Thereupon, M. Gillenormand capitulated. He\nsent the two brats back to their mother, promising to pay eighty francs\na month for their maintenance, on the condition that the said mother\nwould not do so any more. He added: “I insist upon it that the mother\nshall treat them well. I shall go to see them from time to time.” And\nthis he did. He had had a brother who was a priest, and who had been\nrector of the Academy of Poitiers for three and thirty years, and had\ndied at seventy-nine. “I lost him young,” said he. This brother, of\nwhom but little memory remains, was a peaceable miser, who, being a\npriest, thought himself bound to bestow alms on the poor whom he met,\nbut he never gave them anything except bad or demonetized sous, thereby\ndiscovering a means of going to hell by way of paradise. As for M.\nGillenormand the elder, he never haggled over his alms-giving, but gave\ngladly and nobly. He was kindly, abrupt, charitable, and if he had been\nrich, his turn of mind would have been magnificent. He desired that all\nwhich concerned him should be done in a grand manner, even his\nrogueries. One day, having been cheated by a business man in a matter\nof inheritance, in a gross and apparent manner, he uttered this solemn\nexclamation: “That was indecently done! I am really ashamed of this\npilfering. Everything has degenerated in this century, even the\nrascals. Morbleu! this is not the way to rob a man of my standing. I am\nrobbed as though in a forest, but badly robbed. _Silvæ sint consule\ndignæ! _” He had had two wives, as we have already mentioned; by the\nfirst he had had a daughter, who had remained unmarried, and by the\nsecond another daughter, who had died at about the age of thirty, who\nhad wedded, through love, or chance, or otherwise, a soldier of fortune\nwho had served in the armies of the Republic and of the Empire, who had\nwon the cross at Austerlitz and had been made colonel at Waterloo. _“He\nis the disgrace of my family,” _ said the old bourgeois. He took an\nimmense amount of snuff, and had a particularly graceful manner of\nplucking at his lace ruffle with the back of one hand. He believed very\nlittle in God.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—RULE: RECEIVE NO ONE EXCEPT IN THE EVENING\n\n\nSuch was M. Luc-Esprit Gillenormand, who had not lost his hair,—which\nwas gray rather than white,—and which was always dressed in “dog’s\nears.” To sum up, he was venerable in spite of all this.\n\nHe had something of the eighteenth century about him; frivolous and\ngreat.\n\nIn 1814 and during the early years of the Restoration, M. Gillenormand,\nwho was still young,—he was only seventy-four,—lived in the Faubourg\nSaint Germain, Rue Servandoni, near Saint-Sulpice. He had only retired\nto the Marais when he quitted society, long after attaining the age of\neighty.\n\nAnd, on abandoning society, he had immured himself in his habits. The\nprincipal one, and that which was invariable, was to keep his door\nabsolutely closed during the day, and never to receive any one whatever\nexcept in the evening. He dined at five o’clock, and after that his\ndoor was open. That had been the fashion of his century, and he would\nnot swerve from it. “The day is vulgar,” said he, “and deserves only a\nclosed shutter. Fashionable people only light up their minds when the\nzenith lights up its stars.” And he barricaded himself against every\none, even had it been the king himself. This was the antiquated\nelegance of his day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—TWO DO NOT MAKE A PAIR\n\n\nWe have just spoken of M. Gillenormand’s two daughters. They had come\ninto the world ten years apart. In their youth they had borne very\nlittle resemblance to each other, either in character or countenance,\nand had also been as little like sisters to each other as possible. The\nyoungest had a charming soul, which turned towards all that belongs to\nthe light, was occupied with flowers, with verses, with music, which\nfluttered away into glorious space, enthusiastic, ethereal, and was\nwedded from her very youth, in ideal, to a vague and heroic figure. The\nelder had also her chimera; she espied in the azure some very wealthy\npurveyor, a contractor, a splendidly stupid husband, a million made\nman, or even a prefect; the receptions of the Prefecture, an usher in\nthe antechamber with a chain on his neck, official balls, the harangues\nof the town-hall, to be “Madame la Préfète,”—all this had created a\nwhirlwind in her imagination. Thus the two sisters strayed, each in her\nown dream, at the epoch when they were young girls. Both had wings, the\none like an angel, the other like a goose.\n\nNo ambition is ever fully realized, here below at least. No paradise\nbecomes terrestrial in our day. The younger wedded the man of her\ndreams, but she died. The elder did not marry at all.\n\nAt the moment when she makes her entrance into this history which we\nare relating, she was an antique virtue, an incombustible prude, with\none of the sharpest noses, and one of the most obtuse minds that it is\npossible to see. A characteristic detail; outside of her immediate\nfamily, no one had ever known her first name. She was called\n_Mademoiselle Gillenormand, the elder_.\n\nIn the matter of _cant_, Mademoiselle Gillenormand could have given\npoints to a miss. Her modesty was carried to the other extreme of\nblackness. She cherished a frightful memory of her life; one day, a man\nhad beheld her garter.\n\nAge had only served to accentuate this pitiless modesty. Her guimpe was\nnever sufficiently opaque, and never ascended sufficiently high. She\nmultiplied clasps and pins where no one would have dreamed of looking.\nThe peculiarity of prudery is to place all the more sentinels in\nproportion as the fortress is the less menaced.\n\nNevertheless, let him who can explain these antique mysteries of\ninnocence, she allowed an officer of the Lancers, her grand nephew,\nnamed Théodule, to embrace her without displeasure.\n\nIn spite of this favored Lancer, the label: _Prude_, under which we\nhave classed her, suited her to absolute perfection. Mademoiselle\nGillenormand was a sort of twilight soul. Prudery is a demi-virtue and\na demi-vice.\n\nTo prudery she added bigotry, a well-assorted lining. She belonged to\nthe society of the Virgin, wore a white veil on certain festivals,\nmumbled special orisons, revered “the holy blood,” venerated “the\nsacred heart,” remained for hours in contemplation before a\nrococo-jesuit altar in a chapel which was inaccessible to the rank and\nfile of the faithful, and there allowed her soul to soar among little\nclouds of marble, and through great rays of gilded wood.\n\nShe had a chapel friend, an ancient virgin like herself, named\nMademoiselle Vaubois, who was a positive blockhead, and beside whom\nMademoiselle Gillenormand had the pleasure of being an eagle. Beyond\nthe Agnus Dei and Ave Maria, Mademoiselle Vaubois had no knowledge of\nanything except of the different ways of making preserves. Mademoiselle\nVaubois, perfect in her style, was the ermine of stupidity without a\nsingle spot of intelligence.\n\nLet us say it plainly, Mademoiselle Gillenormand had gained rather than\nlost as she grew older. This is the case with passive natures. She had\nnever been malicious, which is relative kindness; and then, years wear\naway the angles, and the softening which comes with time had come to\nher. She was melancholy with an obscure sadness of which she did not\nherself know the secret. There breathed from her whole person the\nstupor of a life that was finished, and which had never had a\nbeginning.\n\nShe kept house for her father. M. Gillenormand had his daughter near\nhim, as we have seen that Monseigneur Bienvenu had his sister with him.\nThese households comprised of an old man and an old spinster are not\nrare, and always have the touching aspect of two weaknesses leaning on\neach other for support.\n\nThere was also in this house, between this elderly spinster and this\nold man, a child, a little boy, who was always trembling and mute in\nthe presence of M. Gillenormand. M. Gillenormand never addressed this\nchild except in a severe voice, and sometimes, with uplifted cane:\n“Here, sir! rascal, scoundrel, come here!—Answer me, you scamp! Just\nlet me see you, you good-for-nothing!” etc., etc. He idolized him.\n\nThis was his grandson. We shall meet with this child again later on.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THIRD—THE GRANDFATHER AND THE GRANDSON\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—AN ANCIENT SALON\n\n\nWhen M. Gillenormand lived in the Rue Servandoni, he had frequented\nmany very good and very aristocratic salons. Although a bourgeois, M.\nGillenormand was received in society. As he had a double measure of\nwit, in the first place, that which was born with him, and secondly,\nthat which was attributed to him, he was even sought out and made much\nof. He never went anywhere except on condition of being the chief\nperson there. There are people who will have influence at any price,\nand who will have other people busy themselves over them; when they\ncannot be oracles, they turn wags. M. Gillenormand was not of this\nnature; his domination in the Royalist salons which he frequented cost\nhis self-respect nothing. He was an oracle everywhere. It had happened\nto him to hold his own against M. de Bonald, and even against M.\nBengy-Puy-Vallée.\n\nAbout 1817, he invariably passed two afternoons a week in a house in\nhis own neighborhood, in the Rue Férou, with Madame la Baronne de T., a\nworthy and respectable person, whose husband had been Ambassador of\nFrance to Berlin under Louis XVI. Baron de T., who, during his\nlifetime, had gone very passionately into ecstasies and magnetic\nvisions, had died bankrupt, during the emigration, leaving, as his\nentire fortune, some very curious Memoirs about Mesmer and his tub, in\nten manuscript volumes, bound in red morocco and gilded on the edges.\nMadame de T. had not published the memoirs, out of pride, and\nmaintained herself on a meagre income which had survived no one knew\nhow.\n\nMadame de T. lived far from the Court; “a very mixed society,” as she\nsaid, in a noble isolation, proud and poor. A few friends assembled\ntwice a week about her widowed hearth, and these constituted a purely\nRoyalist salon. They sipped tea there, and uttered groans or cries of\nhorror at the century, the charter, the Bonapartists, the prostitution\nof the blue ribbon, or the Jacobinism of Louis XVIII., according as the\nwind veered towards elegy or dithyrambs; and they spoke in low tones of\nthe hopes which were presented by Monsieur, afterwards Charles X.\n\nThe songs of the fishwomen, in which Napoleon was called _Nicolas_,\nwere received there with transports of joy. Duchesses, the most\ndelicate and charming women in the world, went into ecstasies over\ncouplets like the following, addressed to “the federates”:—\n\nRefoncez dans vos culottes\nLe bout d’ chemis’ qui vous pend.\nQu’on n’ dis’ pas qu’ les patriotes\nOnt arboré l’ drapeau blanc?20\n\n\nThere they amused themselves with puns which were considered terrible,\nwith innocent plays upon words which they supposed to be venomous, with\nquatrains, with distiches even; thus, upon the Dessolles ministry, a\nmoderate cabinet, of which MM. Decazes and Deserre were members:—\n\nPour raffermir le trône ébranlé sur sa base,\nIl faut changer de sol, et de serre et de case.21\n\n\nOr they drew up a list of the chamber of peers, “an abominably Jacobin\nchamber,” and from this list they combined alliances of names, in such\na manner as to form, for example, phrases like the following: _Damas.\nSabran. Gouvion-Saint-Cyr_.—All this was done merrily. In that society,\nthey parodied the Revolution. They used I know not what desires to give\npoint to the same wrath in inverse sense. They sang their little _Ça\nira: _—\n\nAh! ça ira ça ira ça ira!\nLes Bonapartistes à la lanterne!\n\n\nSongs are like the guillotine; they chop away indifferently, to-day\nthis head, to-morrow that. It is only a variation.\n\nIn the Fualdès affair, which belongs to this epoch, 1816, they took\npart for Bastide and Jausion, because Fualdès was “a Buonapartist.”\nThey designated the liberals as f_riends and brothers_; this\nconstituted the most deadly insult.\n\nLike certain church towers, Madame de T.‘s salon had two cocks. One of\nthem was M. Gillenormand, the other was Comte de Lamothe-Valois, of\nwhom it was whispered about, with a sort of respect: “Do you know? That\nis the Lamothe of the affair of the necklace.” These singular amnesties\ndo occur in parties.\n\nLet us add the following: in the bourgeoisie, honored situations decay\nthrough too easy relations; one must beware whom one admits; in the\nsame way that there is a loss of caloric in the vicinity of those who\nare cold, there is a diminution of consideration in the approach of\ndespised persons. The ancient society of the upper classes held\nthemselves above this law, as above every other. Marigny, the brother\nof the Pompadour, had his entry with M. le Prince de Soubise. In spite\nof? No, because. Du Barry, the god-father of the Vaubernier, was very\nwelcome at the house of M. le Maréchal de Richelieu. This society is\nOlympus. Mercury and the Prince de Guémenée are at home there. A thief\nis admitted there, provided he be a god.\n\nThe Comte de Lamothe, who, in 1815, was an old man seventy-five years\nof age, had nothing remarkable about him except his silent and\nsententious air, his cold and angular face, his perfectly polished\nmanners, his coat buttoned up to his cravat, and his long legs always\ncrossed in long, flabby trousers of the hue of burnt sienna. His face\nwas the same color as his trousers.\n\nThis M. de Lamothe was “held in consideration” in this salon on account\nof his “celebrity” and, strange to say, though true, because of his\nname of Valois.\n\nAs for M. Gillenormand, his consideration was of absolutely first-rate\nquality. He had, in spite of his levity, and without its interfering in\nany way with his dignity, a certain manner about him which was\nimposing, dignified, honest, and lofty, in a bourgeois fashion; and his\ngreat age added to it. One is not a century with impunity. The years\nfinally produce around a head a venerable dishevelment.\n\nIn addition to this, he said things which had the genuine sparkle of\nthe old rock. Thus, when the King of Prussia, after having restored\nLouis XVIII., came to pay the latter a visit under the name of the\nCount de Ruppin, he was received by the descendant of Louis XIV.\nsomewhat as though he had been the Marquis de Brandebourg, and with the\nmost delicate impertinence. M. Gillenormand approved: “All kings who\nare not the King of France,” said he, “are provincial kings.” One day,\nthe following question was put and the following answer returned in his\npresence: “To what was the editor of the _Courrier Français_\ncondemned?” “To be suspended.” “_Sus_ is superfluous,” observed M.\nGillenormand.22 Remarks of this nature found a situation.\n\nAt the Te Deum on the anniversary of the return of the Bourbons, he\nsaid, on seeing M. de Talleyrand pass by: “There goes his Excellency\nthe Evil One.”\n\n\nM. Gillenormand was always accompanied by his daughter, that tall\nmademoiselle, who was over forty and looked fifty, and by a handsome\nlittle boy of seven years, white, rosy, fresh, with happy and trusting\neyes, who never appeared in that salon without hearing voices murmur\naround him: “How handsome he is! What a pity! Poor child!” This child\nwas the one of whom we dropped a word a while ago. He was called “poor\nchild,” because he had for a father “a brigand of the Loire.”\n\n\nThis brigand of the Loire was M. Gillenormand’s son-in-law, who has\nalready been mentioned, and whom M. Gillenormand called “the disgrace\nof his family.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—ONE OF THE RED SPECTRES OF THAT EPOCH\n\n\nAny one who had chanced to pass through the little town of Vernon at\nthis epoch, and who had happened to walk across that fine monumental\nbridge, which will soon be succeeded, let us hope, by some hideous iron\ncable bridge, might have observed, had he dropped his eyes over the\nparapet, a man about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap, and\ntrousers and a waistcoat of coarse gray cloth, to which something\nyellow which had been a red ribbon, was sewn, shod with wooden sabots,\ntanned by the sun, his face nearly black and his hair nearly white, a\nlarge scar on his forehead which ran down upon his cheek, bowed, bent,\nprematurely aged, who walked nearly every day, hoe and sickle in hand,\nin one of those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the\nbridge, and border the left bank of the Seine like a chain of terraces,\ncharming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say, were they\nmuch larger: “these are gardens,” and were they a little smaller:\n“these are bouquets.” All these enclosures abut upon the river at one\nend, and on a house at the other. The man in the waistcoat and the\nwooden shoes of whom we have just spoken, inhabited the smallest of\nthese enclosures and the most humble of these houses about 1817. He\nlived there alone and solitary, silently and poorly, with a woman who\nwas neither young nor old, neither homely nor pretty, neither a peasant\nnor a bourgeoise, who served him. The plot of earth which he called his\ngarden was celebrated in the town for the beauty of the flowers which\nhe cultivated there. These flowers were his occupation.\n\nBy dint of labor, of perseverance, of attention, and of buckets of\nwater, he had succeeded in creating after the Creator, and he had\ninvented certain tulips and certain dahlias which seemed to have been\nforgotten by nature. He was ingenious; he had forestalled Soulange\nBodin in the formation of little clumps of earth of heath mould, for\nthe cultivation of rare and precious shrubs from America and China. He\nwas in his alleys from the break of day, in summer, planting, cutting,\nhoeing, watering, walking amid his flowers with an air of kindness,\nsadness, and sweetness, sometimes standing motionless and thoughtful\nfor hours, listening to the song of a bird in the trees, the babble of\na child in a house, or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip\nof a spear of grass, of which the sun made a carbuncle. His table was\nvery plain, and he drank more milk than wine. A child could make him\ngive way, and his servant scolded him. He was so timid that he seemed\nshy, he rarely went out, and he saw no one but the poor people who\ntapped at his pane and his curé, the Abbé Mabeuf, a good old man.\nNevertheless, if the inhabitants of the town, or strangers, or any\nchance comers, curious to see his tulips, rang at his little cottage,\nhe opened his door with a smile. He was the “brigand of the Loire.”\n\n\nAny one who had, at the same time, read military memoirs, biographies,\nthe _Moniteur_, and the bulletins of the grand army, would have been\nstruck by a name which occurs there with tolerable frequency, the name\nof Georges Pontmercy. When very young, this Georges Pontmercy had been\na soldier in Saintonge’s regiment. The revolution broke out.\nSaintonge’s regiment formed a part of the army of the Rhine; for the\nold regiments of the monarchy preserved their names of provinces even\nafter the fall of the monarchy, and were only divided into brigades in\n1794. Pontmercy fought at Spire, at Worms, at Neustadt, at Turkheim, at\nAlzey, at Mayence, where he was one of the two hundred who formed\nHouchard’s rearguard. It was the twelfth to hold its ground against the\ncorps of the Prince of Hesse, behind the old rampart of Andernach, and\nonly rejoined the main body of the army when the enemy’s cannon had\nopened a breach from the cord of the parapet to the foot of the glacis.\nHe was under Kléber at Marchiennes and at the battle of Mont-Palissel,\nwhere a ball from a biscaïen broke his arm. Then he passed to the\nfrontier of Italy, and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended\nthe Col de Tende with Joubert. Joubert was appointed its\nadjutant-general, and Pontmercy sub-lieutenant. Pontmercy was by\nBerthier’s side in the midst of the grape-shot of that day at Lodi\nwhich caused Bonaparte to say: “Berthier has been cannoneer, cavalier,\nand grenadier.” He beheld his old general, Joubert, fall at Novi, at\nthe moment when, with uplifted sabre, he was shouting: “Forward!”\nHaving been embarked with his company in the exigencies of the\ncampaign, on board a pinnace which was proceeding from Genoa to some\nobscure port on the coast, he fell into a wasps’-nest of seven or eight\nEnglish vessels. The Genoese commander wanted to throw his cannon into\nthe sea, to hide the soldiers between decks, and to slip along in the\ndark as a merchant vessel. Pontmercy had the colors hoisted to the\npeak, and sailed proudly past under the guns of the British frigates.\nTwenty leagues further on, his audacity having increased, he attacked\nwith his pinnace, and captured a large English transport which was\ncarrying troops to Sicily, and which was so loaded down with men and\nhorses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea. In 1805 he was\nin that Malher division which took Günzberg from the Archduke\nFerdinand. At Weltingen he received into his arms, beneath a storm of\nbullets, Colonel Maupetit, mortally wounded at the head of the 9th\nDragoons. He distinguished himself at Austerlitz in that admirable\nmarch in echelons effected under the enemy’s fire. When the cavalry of\nthe Imperial Russian Guard crushed a battalion of the 4th of the line,\nPontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew the\nGuard. The Emperor gave him the cross. Pontmercy saw Wurmser at Mantua,\nMélas, and Alexandria, Mack at Ulm, made prisoners in succession. He\nformed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which Mortier\ncommanded, and which captured Hamburg. Then he was transferred to the\n55th of the line, which was the old regiment of Flanders. At Eylau he\nwas in the cemetery where, for the space of two hours, the heroic\nCaptain Louis Hugo, the uncle of the author of this book, sustained\nalone with his company of eighty-three men every effort of the hostile\narmy. Pontmercy was one of the three who emerged alive from that\ncemetery. He was at Friedland. Then he saw Moscow. Then La Bérésina,\nthen Lutzen, Bautzen, Dresden, Wachau, Leipzig, and the defiles of\nGelenhausen; then Montmirail, Château-Thierry, Craon, the banks of the\nMarne, the banks of the Aisne, and the redoubtable position of Laon. At\nArnay-Le-Duc, being then a captain, he put ten Cossacks to the sword,\nand saved, not his general, but his corporal. He was well slashed up on\nthis occasion, and twenty-seven splinters were extracted from his left\narm alone. Eight days before the capitulation of Paris he had just\nexchanged with a comrade and entered the cavalry. He had what was\ncalled under the old regime, _the double hand_, that is to say, an\nequal aptitude for handling the sabre or the musket as a soldier, or a\nsquadron or a battalion as an officer. It is from this aptitude,\nperfected by a military education, which certain special branches of\nthe service arise, the dragoons, for example, who are both cavalry-men\nand infantry at one and the same time. He accompanied Napoleon to the\nIsland of Elba. At Waterloo, he was chief of a squadron of cuirassiers,\nin Dubois’ brigade. It was he who captured the standard of the\nLunenburg battalion. He came and cast the flag at the Emperor’s feet.\nHe was covered with blood. While tearing down the banner he had\nreceived a sword-cut across his face. The Emperor, greatly pleased,\nshouted to him: “You are a colonel, you are a baron, you are an officer\nof the Legion of Honor!” Pontmercy replied: “Sire, I thank you for my\nwidow.” An hour later, he fell in the ravine of Ohain. Now, who was\nthis Georges Pontmercy? He was this same “brigand of the Loire.”\n\n\nWe have already seen something of his history. After Waterloo,\nPontmercy, who had been pulled out of the hollow road of Ohain, as it\nwill be remembered, had succeeded in joining the army, and had dragged\nhimself from ambulance to ambulance as far as the cantonments of the\nLoire.\n\nThe Restoration had placed him on half-pay, then had sent him into\nresidence, that is to say, under surveillance, at Vernon. King Louis\nXVIII., regarding all that which had taken place during the Hundred\nDays as not having occurred at all, did not recognize his quality as an\nofficer of the Legion of Honor, nor his grade of colonel, nor his title\nof baron. He, on his side, neglected no occasion of signing himself\n“Colonel Baron Pontmercy.” He had only an old blue coat, and he never\nwent out without fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the\nLegion of Honor. The Attorney for the Crown had him warned that the\nauthorities would prosecute him for “illegal” wearing of this\ndecoration. When this notice was conveyed to him through an officious\nintermediary, Pontmercy retorted with a bitter smile: “I do not know\nwhether I no longer understand French, or whether you no longer speak\nit; but the fact is that I do not understand.” Then he went out for\neight successive days with his rosette. They dared not interfere with\nhim. Two or three times the Minister of War and the general in command\nof the department wrote to him with the following address: _“A Monsieur\nle Commandant Pontmercy.” _ He sent back the letters with the seals\nunbroken. At the same moment, Napoleon at Saint Helena was treating in\nthe same fashion the missives of Sir Hudson Lowe addressed to _General\nBonaparte_. Pontmercy had ended, may we be pardoned the expression, by\nhaving in his mouth the same saliva as his Emperor.\n\nIn the same way, there were at Rome Carthaginian prisoners who refused\nto salute Flaminius, and who had a little of Hannibal’s spirit.\n\nOne day he encountered the district-attorney in one of the streets of\nVernon, stepped up to him, and said: “Mr. Crown Attorney, am I\npermitted to wear my scar?”\n\n\nHe had nothing save his meagre half-pay as chief of squadron. He had\nhired the smallest house which he could find at Vernon. He lived there\nalone, we have just seen how. Under the Empire, between two wars, he\nhad found time to marry Mademoiselle Gillenormand. The old bourgeois,\nthoroughly indignant at bottom, had given his consent with a sigh,\nsaying: “The greatest families are forced into it.” In 1815, Madame\nPontmercy, an admirable woman in every sense, by the way, lofty in\nsentiment and rare, and worthy of her husband, died, leaving a child.\nThis child had been the colonel’s joy in his solitude; but the\ngrandfather had imperatively claimed his grandson, declaring that if\nthe child were not given to him he would disinherit him. The father had\nyielded in the little one’s interest, and had transferred his love to\nflowers.\n\nMoreover, he had renounced everything, and neither stirred up mischief\nnor conspired. He shared his thoughts between the innocent things which\nhe was then doing and the great things which he had done. He passed his\ntime in expecting a pink or in recalling Austerlitz.\n\nM. Gillenormand kept up no relations with his son-in-law. The colonel\nwas “a bandit” to him. M. Gillenormand never mentioned the colonel,\nexcept when he occasionally made mocking allusions to “his Baronship.”\nIt had been expressly agreed that Pontmercy should never attempt to see\nhis son nor to speak to him, under penalty of having the latter handed\nover to him disowned and disinherited. For the Gillenormands, Pontmercy\nwas a man afflicted with the plague. They intended to bring up the\nchild in their own way. Perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these\nconditions, but he submitted to them, thinking that he was doing right\nand sacrificing no one but himself.\n\nThe inheritance of Father Gillenormand did not amount to much; but the\ninheritance of Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder was considerable.\nThis aunt, who had remained unmarried, was very rich on the maternal\nside, and her sister’s son was her natural heir. The boy, whose name\nwas Marius, knew that he had a father, but nothing more. No one opened\nhis mouth to him about it. Nevertheless, in the society into which his\ngrandfather took him, whispers, innuendoes, and winks, had eventually\nenlightened the little boy’s mind; he had finally understood something\nof the case, and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which\nwere, so to speak, the air he breathed, by a sort of infiltration and\nslow penetration, he gradually came to think of his father only with\nshame and with a pain at his heart.\n\nWhile he was growing up in this fashion, the colonel slipped away every\ntwo or three months, came to Paris on the sly, like a criminal breaking\nhis ban, and went and posted himself at Saint-Sulpice, at the hour when\nAunt Gillenormand led Marius to the mass. There, trembling lest the\naunt should turn round, concealed behind a pillar, motionless, not\ndaring to breathe, he gazed at his child. The scarred veteran was\nafraid of that old spinster.\n\nFrom this had arisen his connection with the curé of Vernon, M. l’Abbé\nMabeuf.\n\nThat worthy priest was the brother of a warden of Saint-Sulpice, who\nhad often observed this man gazing at his child, and the scar on his\ncheek, and the large tears in his eyes. That man, who had so manly an\nair, yet who was weeping like a woman, had struck the warden. That face\nhad clung to his mind. One day, having gone to Vernon to see his\nbrother, he had encountered Colonel Pontmercy on the bridge, and had\nrecognized the man of Saint-Sulpice. The warden had mentioned the\ncircumstance to the curé, and both had paid the colonel a visit, on\nsome pretext or other. This visit led to others. The colonel, who had\nbeen extremely reserved at first, ended by opening his heart, and the\ncuré and the warden finally came to know the whole history, and how\nPontmercy was sacrificing his happiness to his child’s future. This\ncaused the curé to regard him with veneration and tenderness, and the\ncolonel, on his side, became fond of the curé. And moreover, when both\nare sincere and good, no men so penetrate each other, and so amalgamate\nwith each other, as an old priest and an old soldier. At bottom, the\nman is the same. The one has devoted his life to his country here\nbelow, the other to his country on high; that is the only difference.\n\nTwice a year, on the first of January and on St. George’s day, Marius\nwrote duty letters to his father, which were dictated by his aunt, and\nwhich one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula; this\nwas all that M. Gillenormand tolerated; and the father answered them\nwith very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket\nunread.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—REQUIESCANT\n\n\nMadame de T.‘s salon was all that Marius Pontmercy knew of the world.\nIt was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life.\nThis opening was sombre, and more cold than warmth, more night than\nday, came to him through this skylight. This child, who had been all\njoy and light on entering this strange world, soon became melancholy,\nand, what is still more contrary to his age, grave. Surrounded by all\nthose singular and imposing personages, he gazed about him with serious\namazement. Everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him.\nThere were in Madame de T.‘s salon some very noble ladies named Mathan,\nNoé, Lévis,—which was pronounced Lévi,—Cambis, pronounced Cambyse.\nThese antique visages and these Biblical names mingled in the child’s\nmind with the Old Testament which he was learning by heart, and when\nthey were all there, seated in a circle around a dying fire, sparely\nlighted by a lamp shaded with green, with their severe profiles, their\ngray or white hair, their long gowns of another age, whose lugubrious\ncolors could not be distinguished, dropping, at rare intervals, words\nwhich were both majestic and severe, little Marius stared at them with\nfrightened eyes, in the conviction that he beheld not women, but\npatriarchs and magi, not real beings, but phantoms.\n\nWith these phantoms, priests were sometimes mingled, frequenters of\nthis ancient salon, and some gentlemen; the Marquis de Sass****,\nprivate secretary to Madame de Berry, the Vicomte de Val***, who\npublished, under the pseudonym of _Charles-Antoine_, monorhymed odes,\nthe Prince de Beauff*******, who, though very young, had a gray head\nand a pretty and witty wife, whose very low-necked toilettes of scarlet\nvelvet with gold torsades alarmed these shadows, the Marquis de C*****\nd’E******, the man in all France who best understood “proportioned\npoliteness,” the Comte d’Am*****, the kindly man with the amiable chin,\nand the Chévalier de Port-de-Guy, a pillar of the library of the\nLouvre, called the King’s cabinet, M. de Port-de-Guy, bald, and rather\naged than old, was wont to relate that in 1793, at the age of sixteen,\nhe had been put in the galleys as refractory and chained with an\noctogenarian, the Bishop of Mirepoix, also refractory, but as a priest,\nwhile he was so in the capacity of a soldier. This was at Toulon. Their\nbusiness was to go at night and gather up on the scaffold the heads and\nbodies of the persons who had been guillotined during the day; they\nbore away on their backs these dripping corpses, and their red\ngalley-slave blouses had a clot of blood at the back of the neck, which\nwas dry in the morning and wet at night. These tragic tales abounded in\nMadame de T.‘s salon, and by dint of cursing Marat, they applauded\nTrestaillon. Some deputies of the undiscoverable variety played their\nwhist there; M. Thibord du Chalard, M. Lemarchant de Gomicourt, and the\ncelebrated scoffer of the right, M. Cornet-Dincourt. The bailiff de\nFerrette, with his short breeches and his thin legs, sometimes\ntraversed this salon on his way to M. de Talleyrand. He had been M. le\nComte d’Artois’ companion in pleasures and unlike Aristotle crouching\nunder Campaspe, he had made the Guimard crawl on all fours, and in that\nway he had exhibited to the ages a philosopher avenged by a bailiff. As\nfor the priests, there was the Abbé Halma, the same to whom M. Larose,\nhis collaborator on _la Foudre_, said: “Bah! Who is there who is not\nfifty years old? a few greenhorns perhaps?” The Abbé Letourneur,\npreacher to the King, the Abbé Frayssinous, who was not, as yet, either\ncount, or bishop, or minister, or peer, and who wore an old cassock\nwhose buttons were missing, and the Abbé Keravenant, Curé of\nSaint-Germain-des-Prés; also the Pope’s Nuncio, then Monsignor Macchi,\nArchbishop of Nisibi, later on Cardinal, remarkable for his long,\npensive nose, and another Monsignor, entitled thus: Abbate Palmieri,\ndomestic prelate, one of the seven participant prothonotaries of the\nHoly See, Canon of the illustrious Liberian basilica, Advocate of the\nsaints, _Postulatore dei Santi_, which refers to matters of\ncanonization, and signifies very nearly: Master of Requests of the\nsection of Paradise. Lastly, two cardinals, M. de la Luzerne, and M. de\nCl****** T*******. The Cardinal of Luzerne was a writer and was\ndestined to have, a few years later, the honor of signing in the\n_Conservateur_ articles side by side with Chateaubriand; M. de Cl******\nT******* was Archbishop of Toul****, and often made trips to Paris, to\nhis nephew, the Marquis de T*******, who was Minister of Marine and\nWar. The Cardinal of Cl****** T******* was a merry little man, who\ndisplayed his red stockings beneath his tucked-up cassock; his\nspecialty was a hatred of the Encyclopædia, and his desperate play at\nbilliards, and persons who, at that epoch, passed through the Rue\nM***** on summer evenings, where the hotel de Cl****** T******* then\nstood, halted to listen to the shock of the balls and the piercing\nvoice of the Cardinal shouting to his conclavist, Monseigneur Cotiret,\nBishop _in partibus_ of Caryste: “Mark, Abbé, I make a cannon.” The\nCardinal de Cl****** T******* had been brought to Madame de T.‘s by his\nmost intimate friend, M. de Roquelaure, former Bishop of Senlis, and\none of the Forty. M. de Roquelaure was notable for his lofty figure and\nhis assiduity at the Academy; through the glass door of the neighboring\nhall of the library where the French Academy then held its meetings,\nthe curious could, on every Tuesday, contemplate the Ex-Bishop of\nSenlis, usually standing erect, freshly powdered, in violet hose, with\nhis back turned to the door, apparently for the purpose of allowing a\nbetter view of his little collar. All these ecclesiastics, though for\nthe most part as much courtiers as churchmen, added to the gravity of\nthe T. salon, whose seigniorial aspect was accentuated by five peers of\nFrance, the Marquis de Vib****, the Marquis de Tal***, the Marquis de\nHerb*******, the Vicomte Damb***, and the Duc de Val********. This Duc\nde Val********, although Prince de Mon***, that is to say a reigning\nprince abroad, had so high an idea of France and its peerage, that he\nviewed everything through their medium. It was he who said: “The\nCardinals are the peers of France of Rome; the lords are the peers of\nFrance of England.” Moreover, as it is indispensable that the\nRevolution should be everywhere in this century, this feudal salon was,\nas we have said, dominated by a bourgeois. M. Gillenormand reigned\nthere.\n\nThere lay the essence and quintessence of the Parisian white society.\nThere reputations, even Royalist reputations, were held in quarantine.\nThere is always a trace of anarchy in renown. Chateaubriand, had he\nentered there, would have produced the effect of Père Duchêne. Some of\nthe scoffed-at did, nevertheless, penetrate thither on sufferance.\nComte Beug*** was received there, subject to correction.\n\nThe “noble” salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons.\nThe Faubourg Saint-Germain reeks of the fagot even now. The Royalists\nof to-day are demagogues, let us record it to their credit.\n\nAt Madame de T.‘s the society was superior, taste was exquisite and\nhaughty, under the cover of a great show of politeness. Manners there\nadmitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old\nrégime itself, buried but still alive. Some of these habits, especially\nin the matter of language, seem eccentric. Persons but superficially\nacquainted with them would have taken for provincial that which was\nonly antique. A woman was called _Madame la Générale. Madame la\nColonelle_ was not entirely disused. The charming Madame de Léon, in\nmemory, no doubt, of the Duchesses de Longueville and de Chevreuse,\npreferred this appellation to her title of Princesse. The Marquise de\nCréquy was also called _Madame la Colonelle_.\n\nIt was this little high society which invented at the Tuileries the\nrefinement of speaking to the King in private as _the King_, in the\nthird person, and never as _Your Majesty_, the designation of _Your\nMajesty_ having been “soiled by the usurper.”\n\n\nMen and deeds were brought to judgment there. They jeered at the age,\nwhich released them from the necessity of understanding it. They\nabetted each other in amazement. They communicated to each other that\nmodicum of light which they possessed. Methuselah bestowed information\non Epimenides. The deaf man made the blind man acquainted with the\ncourse of things. They declared that the time which had elapsed since\nCoblentz had not existed. In the same manner that Louis XVIII. was by\nthe grace of God, in the five and twentieth year of his reign, the\nemigrants were, by rights, in the five and twentieth year of their\nadolescence.\n\nAll was harmonious; nothing was too much alive; speech hardly amounted\nto a breath; the newspapers, agreeing with the salons, seemed a\npapyrus. There were some young people, but they were rather dead. The\nliveries in the antechamber were antiquated. These utterly obsolete\npersonages were served by domestics of the same stamp.\n\nThey all had the air of having lived a long time ago, and of\nobstinately resisting the sepulchre. Nearly the whole dictionary\nconsisted of _Conserver, Conservation, Conservateur; to be in good\nodor_,—that was the point. There are, in fact, aromatics in the\nopinions of these venerable groups, and their ideas smelled of it. It\nwas a mummified society. The masters were embalmed, the servants were\nstuffed with straw.\n\nA worthy old marquise, an _emigrée_ and ruined, who had but a solitary\nmaid, continued to say: “My people.”\n\n\nWhat did they do in Madame de T.‘s salon? They were ultra.\n\nTo be ultra; this word, although what it represents may not have\ndisappeared, has no longer any meaning at the present day. Let us\nexplain it.\n\nTo be ultra is to go beyond. It is to attack the sceptre in the name of\nthe throne, and the mitre in the name of the altar; it is to ill-treat\nthe thing which one is dragging, it is to kick over the traces; it is\nto cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received by\nheretics; it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry;\nit is to insult through excess of respect; it is to discover that the\nPope is not sufficiently papish, that the King is not sufficiently\nroyal, and that the night has too much light; it is to be discontented\nwith alabaster, with snow, with the swan and the lily in the name of\nwhiteness; it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becoming\ntheir enemy; it is to be so strongly for, as to be against.\n\nThe ultra spirit especially characterizes the first phase of the\nRestoration.\n\nNothing in history resembles that quarter of an hour which begins in\n1814 and terminates about 1820, with the advent of M. de Villèle, the\npractical man of the Right. These six years were an extraordinary\nmoment; at one and the same time brilliant and gloomy, smiling and\nsombre, illuminated as by the radiance of dawn and entirely covered, at\nthe same time, with the shadows of the great catastrophes which still\nfilled the horizon and were slowly sinking into the past. There existed\nin that light and that shadow, a complete little new and old world,\ncomic and sad, juvenile and senile, which was rubbing its eyes; nothing\nresembles an awakening like a return; a group which regarded France\nwith ill-temper, and which France regarded with irony; good old owls of\nmarquises by the streetful, who had returned, and of ghosts, the\n“former” subjects of amazement at everything, brave and noble gentlemen\nwho smiled at being in France but wept also, delighted to behold their\ncountry once more, in despair at not finding their monarchy; the\nnobility of the Crusades treating the nobility of the Empire, that is\nto say, the nobility of the sword, with scorn; historic races who had\nlost the sense of history; the sons of the companions of Charlemagne\ndisdaining the companions of Napoleon. The swords, as we have just\nremarked, returned the insult; the sword of Fontenoy was laughable and\nnothing but a scrap of rusty iron; the sword of Marengo was odious and\nwas only a sabre. Former days did not recognize Yesterday. People no\nlonger had the feeling for what was grand. There was some one who\ncalled Bonaparte Scapin. This Society no longer exists. Nothing of it,\nwe repeat, exists to-day. When we select from it some one figure at\nrandom, and attempt to make it live again in thought, it seems as\nstrange to us as the world before the Deluge. It is because it, too, as\na matter of fact, has been engulfed in a deluge. It has disappeared\nbeneath two Revolutions. What billows are ideas! How quickly they cover\nall that it is their mission to destroy and to bury, and how promptly\nthey create frightful gulfs!\n\nSuch was the physiognomy of the salons of those distant and candid\ntimes when M. Martainville had more wit than Voltaire.\n\nThese salons had a literature and politics of their own. They believed\nin Fiévée. M. Agier laid down the law in them. They commentated M.\nColnet, the old bookseller and publicist of the Quay Malaquais.\nNapoleon was to them thoroughly the Corsican Ogre. Later on the\nintroduction into history of M. le Marquis de Bonaparte,\nLieutenant-General of the King’s armies, was a concession to the spirit\nof the age.\n\nThese salons did not long preserve their purity. Beginning with 1818,\ndoctrinarians began to spring up in them, a disturbing shade. Their way\nwas to be Royalists and to excuse themselves for being so. Where the\nultras were very proud, the doctrinarians were rather ashamed. They had\nwit; they had silence; their political dogma was suitably impregnated\nwith arrogance; they should have succeeded. They indulged, and usefully\ntoo, in excesses in the matter of white neckties and tightly buttoned\ncoats. The mistake or the misfortune of the doctrinarian party was to\ncreate aged youth. They assumed the poses of wise men. They dreamed of\nengrafting a temperate power on the absolute and excessive principle.\nThey opposed, and sometimes with rare intelligence, conservative\nliberalism to the liberalism which demolishes. They were heard to say:\n“Thanks for Royalism! It has rendered more than one service. It has\nbrought back tradition, worship, religion, respect. It is faithful,\nbrave, chivalric, loving, devoted. It has mingled, though with regret,\nthe secular grandeurs of the monarchy with the new grandeurs of the\nnation. Its mistake is not to understand the Revolution, the Empire,\nglory, liberty, young ideas, young generations, the age. But this\nmistake which it makes with regard to us,—have we not sometimes been\nguilty of it towards them? The Revolution, whose heirs we are, ought to\nbe intelligent on all points. To attack Royalism is a misconstruction\nof liberalism. What an error! And what blindness! Revolutionary France\nis wanting in respect towards historic France, that is to say, towards\nits mother, that is to say, towards itself. After the 5th of September,\nthe nobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the Empire\nwas treated after the 5th of July. They were unjust to the eagle, we\nare unjust to the fleur-de-lys. It seems that we must always have\nsomething to proscribe! Does it serve any purpose to ungild the crown\nof Louis XIV., to scrape the coat of arms of Henry IV.? We scoff at M.\nde Vaublanc for erasing the N’s from the bridge of Jena! What was it\nthat he did? What are we doing? Bouvines belongs to us as well as\nMarengo. The fleurs-de-lys are ours as well as the N’s. That is our\npatrimony. To what purpose shall we diminish it? We must not deny our\ncountry in the past any more than in the present. Why not accept the\nwhole of history? Why not love the whole of France?”\n\n\nIt is thus that doctrinarians criticised and protected Royalism, which\nwas displeased at criticism and furious at protection.\n\nThe ultras marked the first epoch of Royalism, congregation\ncharacterized the second. Skill follows ardor. Let us confine ourselves\nhere to this sketch.\n\nIn the course of this narrative, the author of this book has\nencountered in his path this curious moment of contemporary history; he\nhas been forced to cast a passing glance upon it, and to trace once\nmore some of the singular features of this society which is unknown\nto-day. But he does it rapidly and without any bitter or derisive idea.\nSouvenirs both respectful and affectionate, for they touch his mother,\nattach him to this past. Moreover, let us remark, this same petty world\nhad a grandeur of its own. One may smile at it, but one can neither\ndespise nor hate it. It was the France of former days.\n\nMarius Pontmercy pursued some studies, as all children do. When he\nemerged from the hands of Aunt Gillenormand, his grandfather confided\nhim to a worthy professor of the most purely classic innocence. This\nyoung soul which was expanding passed from a prude to a vulgar pedant.\n\nMarius went through his years of college, then he entered the law\nschool. He was a Royalist, fanatical and severe. He did not love his\ngrandfather much, as the latter’s gayety and cynicism repelled him, and\nhis feelings towards his father were gloomy.\n\nHe was, on the whole, a cold and ardent, noble, generous, proud,\nreligious, enthusiastic lad; dignified to harshness, pure to shyness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—END OF THE BRIGAND\n\n\nThe conclusion of Marius’ classical studies coincided with M.\nGillenormand’s departure from society. The old man bade farewell to the\nFaubourg Saint-Germain and to Madame de T.‘s salon, and established\nhimself in the Marais, in his house of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire.\nThere he had for servants, in addition to the porter, that chambermaid,\nNicolette, who had succeeded to Magnon, and that short-breathed and\npursy Basque, who have been mentioned above.\n\nIn 1827, Marius had just attained his seventeenth year. One evening, on\nhis return home, he saw his grandfather holding a letter in his hand.\n\n“Marius,” said M. Gillenormand, “you will set out for Vernon\nto-morrow.”\n\n\n“Why?” said Marius.\n\n“To see your father.”\n\n\nMarius was seized with a trembling fit. He had thought of everything\nexcept this—that he should one day be called upon to see his father.\nNothing could be more unexpected, more surprising, and, let us admit\nit, more disagreeable to him. It was forcing estrangement into\nreconciliation. It was not an affliction, but it was an unpleasant\nduty.\n\nMarius, in addition to his motives of political antipathy, was\nconvinced that his father, _the slasher_, as M. Gillenormand called him\non his amiable days, did not love him; this was evident, since he had\nabandoned him to others. Feeling that he was not beloved, he did not\nlove. “Nothing is more simple,” he said to himself.\n\nHe was so astounded that he did not question M. Gillenormand. The\ngrandfather resumed:—\n\n“It appears that he is ill. He demands your presence.”\n\n\nAnd after a pause, he added:—\n\n“Set out to-morrow morning. I think there is a coach which leaves the\nCour des Fontaines at six o’clock, and which arrives in the evening.\nTake it. He says that here is haste.”\n\n\nThen he crushed the letter in his hand and thrust it into his pocket.\nMarius might have set out that very evening and have been with his\nfather on the following morning. A diligence from the Rue du Bouloi\ntook the trip to Rouen by night at that date, and passed through\nVernon. Neither Marius nor M. Gillenormand thought of making inquiries\nabout it.\n\nThe next day, at twilight, Marius reached Vernon. People were just\nbeginning to light their candles. He asked the first person whom he met\nfor “M. Pontmercy’s house.” For in his own mind, he agreed with the\nRestoration, and like it, did not recognize his father’s claim to the\ntitle of either colonel or baron.\n\nThe house was pointed out to him. He rang; a woman with a little lamp\nin her hand opened the door.\n\n“M. Pontmercy?” said Marius.\n\nThe woman remained motionless.\n\n“Is this his house?” demanded Marius.\n\nThe woman nodded affirmatively.\n\n“Can I speak with him?”\n\n\nThe woman shook her head.\n\n“But I am his son!” persisted Marius. “He is expecting me.”\n\n\n“He no longer expects you,” said the woman.\n\nThen he perceived that she was weeping.\n\nShe pointed to the door of a room on the ground floor; he entered.\n\nIn that room, which was lighted by a tallow candle standing on the\nchimney-piece, there were three men, one standing erect, another\nkneeling, and one lying at full length, on the floor in his shirt. The\none on the floor was the colonel.\n\nThe other two were the doctor, and the priest, who was engaged in\nprayer.\n\nThe colonel had been attacked by brain fever three days previously. As\nhe had a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness, he\nhad written to M. Gillenormand to demand his son. The malady had grown\nworse. On the very evening of Marius’ arrival at Vernon, the colonel\nhad had an attack of delirium; he had risen from his bed, in spite of\nthe servant’s efforts to prevent him, crying: “My son is not coming! I\nshall go to meet him!” Then he ran out of his room and fell prostrate\non the floor of the antechamber. He had just expired.\n\nThe doctor had been summoned, and the curé. The doctor had arrived too\nlate. The son had also arrived too late.\n\nBy the dim light of the candle, a large tear could be distinguished on\nthe pale and prostrate colonel’s cheek, where it had trickled from his\ndead eye. The eye was extinguished, but the tear was not yet dry. That\ntear was his son’s delay.\n\nMarius gazed upon that man whom he beheld for the first time, on that\nvenerable and manly face, on those open eyes which saw not, on those\nwhite locks, those robust limbs, on which, here and there, brown lines,\nmarking sword-thrusts, and a sort of red stars, which indicated\nbullet-holes, were visible. He contemplated that gigantic sear which\nstamped heroism on that countenance upon which God had imprinted\ngoodness. He reflected that this man was his father, and that this man\nwas dead, and a chill ran over him.\n\nThe sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have felt in the\npresence of any other man whom he had chanced to behold stretched out\nin death.\n\nAnguish, poignant anguish, was in that chamber. The servant-woman was\nlamenting in a corner, the curé was praying, and his sobs were audible,\nthe doctor was wiping his eyes; the corpse itself was weeping.\n\nThe doctor, the priest, and the woman gazed at Marius in the midst of\ntheir affliction without uttering a word; he was the stranger there.\nMarius, who was far too little affected, felt ashamed and embarrassed\nat his own attitude; he held his hat in his hand; and he dropped it on\nthe floor, in order to produce the impression that grief had deprived\nhim of the strength to hold it.\n\nAt the same time, he experienced remorse, and he despised himself for\nbehaving in this manner. But was it his fault? He did not love his\nfather? Why should he!\n\nThe colonel had left nothing. The sale of big furniture barely paid the\nexpenses of his burial.\n\nThe servant found a scrap of paper, which she handed to Marius. It\ncontained the following, in the colonel’s handwriting:—\n\n“_For my son_.—The Emperor made me a Baron on the battle-field of\nWaterloo. Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which I\npurchased with my blood, my son shall take it and bear it. That he will\nbe worthy of it is a matter of course.” Below, the colonel had added:\n“At that same battle of Waterloo, a sergeant saved my life. The man’s\nname was Thénardier. I think that he has recently been keeping a little\ninn, in a village in the neighborhood of Paris, at Chelles or\nMontfermeil. If my son meets him, he will do all the good he can to\nThénardier.”\n\n\nMarius took this paper and preserved it, not out of duty to his father,\nbut because of that vague respect for death which is always imperious\nin the heart of man.\n\nNothing remained of the colonel. M. Gillenormand had his sword and\nuniform sold to an old-clothes dealer. The neighbors devastated the\ngarden and pillaged the rare flowers. The other plants turned to\nnettles and weeds, and died.\n\nMarius remained only forty-eight hours at Vernon. After the interment\nhe returned to Paris, and applied himself again to his law studies,\nwith no more thought of his father than if the latter had never lived.\nIn two days the colonel was buried, and in three forgotten.\n\nMarius wore crape on his hat. That was all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—THE UTILITY OF GOING TO MASS, IN ORDER TO BECOME A\nREVOLUTIONIST\n\n\nMarius had preserved the religious habits of his childhood. One Sunday,\nwhen he went to hear mass at Saint-Sulpice, at that same chapel of the\nVirgin whither his aunt had led him when a small lad, he placed himself\nbehind a pillar, being more absent-minded and thoughtful than usual on\nthat occasion, and knelt down, without paying any special heed, upon a\nchair of Utrecht velvet, on the back of which was inscribed this name:\n_Monsieur Mabeuf, warden_. Mass had hardly begun when an old man\npresented himself and said to Marius:—\n\n“This is my place, sir.”\n\n\nMarius stepped aside promptly, and the old man took possession of his\nchair.\n\nThe mass concluded, Marius still stood thoughtfully a few paces\ndistant; the old man approached him again and said:—\n\n“I beg your pardon, sir, for having disturbed you a while ago, and for\nagain disturbing you at this moment; you must have thought me\nintrusive, and I will explain myself.”\n\n\n“There is no need of that, Sir,” said Marius.\n\n“Yes!” went on the old man, “I do not wish you to have a bad opinion of\nme. You see, I am attached to this place. It seems to me that the mass\nis better from here. Why? I will tell you. It is from this place, that\nI have watched a poor, brave father come regularly, every two or three\nmonths, for the last ten years, since he had no other opportunity and\nno other way of seeing his child, because he was prevented by family\narrangements. He came at the hour when he knew that his son would be\nbrought to mass. The little one never suspected that his father was\nthere. Perhaps he did not even know that he had a father, poor\ninnocent! The father kept behind a pillar, so that he might not be\nseen. He gazed at his child and he wept. He adored that little fellow,\npoor man! I could see that. This spot has become sanctified in my\nsight, and I have contracted a habit of coming hither to listen to the\nmass. I prefer it to the stall to which I have a right, in my capacity\nof warden. I knew that unhappy gentleman a little, too. He had a\nfather-in-law, a wealthy aunt, relatives, I don’t know exactly what\nall, who threatened to disinherit the child if he, the father, saw him.\nHe sacrificed himself in order that his son might be rich and happy\nsome day. He was separated from him because of political opinions.\nCertainly, I approve of political opinions, but there are people who do\nnot know where to stop. Mon Dieu! a man is not a monster because he was\nat Waterloo; a father is not separated from his child for such a reason\nas that. He was one of Bonaparte’s colonels. He is dead, I believe. He\nlived at Vernon, where I have a brother who is a curé, and his name was\nsomething like Pontmarie or Montpercy. He had a fine sword-cut, on my\nhonor.”\n\n\n“Pontmercy,” suggested Marius, turning pale.\n\n“Precisely, Pontmercy. Did you know him?”\n\n\n“Sir,” said Marius, “he was my father.”\n\n\nThe old warden clasped his hands and exclaimed:—\n\n“Ah! you are the child! Yes, that’s true, he must be a man by this\ntime. Well! poor child, you may say that you had a father who loved you\ndearly!”\n\n\nMarius offered his arm to the old man and conducted him to his\nlodgings.\n\nOn the following day, he said to M. Gillenormand:—\n\n“I have arranged a hunting-party with some friends. Will you permit me\nto be absent for three days?”\n\n\n“Four!” replied his grandfather. “Go and amuse yourself.”\n\n\nAnd he said to his daughter in a low tone, and with a wink, “Some love\naffair!”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—THE CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING MET A WARDEN\n\n\nWhere it was that Marius went will be disclosed a little further on.\n\nMarius was absent for three days, then he returned to Paris, went\nstraight to the library of the law-school and asked for the files of\nthe _Moniteur_.\n\nHe read the _Moniteur_, he read all the histories of the Republic and\nthe Empire, the _Memorial de Sainte-Hélène_, all the memoirs, all the\nnewspapers, the bulletins, the proclamations; he devoured everything.\nThe first time that he came across his father’s name in the bulletins\nof the grand army, he had a fever for a week. He went to see the\ngenerals under whom Georges Pontmercy had served, among others, Comte\nH. Church-warden Mabeuf, whom he went to see again, told him about the\nlife at Vernon, the colonel’s retreat, his flowers, his solitude.\nMarius came to a full knowledge of that rare, sweet, and sublime man,\nthat species of lion-lamb who had been his father.\n\nIn the meanwhile, occupied as he was with this study which absorbed all\nhis moments as well as his thoughts, he hardly saw the Gillenormands at\nall. He made his appearance at meals; then they searched for him, and\nhe was not to be found. Father Gillenormand smiled. “Bah! bah! He is\njust of the age for the girls!” Sometimes the old man added: “The\ndeuce! I thought it was only an affair of gallantry. It seems that it\nis an affair of passion!”\n\n\nIt was a passion, in fact. Marius was on the high road to adoring his\nfather.\n\nAt the same time, his ideas underwent an extraordinary change. The\nphases of this change were numerous and successive. As this is the\nhistory of many minds of our day, we think it will prove useful to\nfollow these phases step by step and to indicate them all.\n\nThat history upon which he had just cast his eyes appalled him.\n\nThe first effect was to dazzle him.\n\nUp to that time, the Republic, the Empire, had been to him only\nmonstrous words. The Republic, a guillotine in the twilight; the\nEmpire, a sword in the night. He had just taken a look at it, and where\nhe had expected to find only a chaos of shadows, he had beheld, with a\nsort of unprecedented surprise, mingled with fear and joy, stars\nsparkling, Mirabeau, Vergniaud, Saint-Just, Robespierre, Camille,\nDesmoulins, Danton, and a sun arise, Napoleon. He did not know where he\nstood. He recoiled, blinded by the brilliant lights. Little by little,\nwhen his astonishment had passed off, he grew accustomed to this\nradiance, he contemplated these deeds without dizziness, he examined\nthese personages without terror; the Revolution and the Empire\npresented themselves luminously, in perspective, before his mind’s eye;\nhe beheld each of these groups of events and of men summed up in two\ntremendous facts: the Republic in the sovereignty of civil right\nrestored to the masses, the Empire in the sovereignty of the French\nidea imposed on Europe; he beheld the grand figure of the people emerge\nfrom the Revolution, and the grand figure of France spring forth from\nthe Empire. He asserted in his conscience, that all this had been good.\nWhat his dazzled state neglected in this, his first far too synthetic\nestimation, we do not think it necessary to point out here. It is the\nstate of a mind on the march that we are recording. Progress is not\naccomplished in one stage. That stated, once for all, in connection\nwith what precedes as well as with what is to follow, we continue.\n\nHe then perceived that, up to that moment, he had comprehended his\ncountry no more than he had comprehended his father. He had not known\neither the one or the other, and a sort of voluntary night had obscured\nhis eyes. Now he saw, and on the one hand he admired, while on the\nother he adored.\n\nHe was filled with regret and remorse, and he reflected in despair that\nall he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb. Oh! if his\nfather had still been in existence, if he had still had him, if God, in\nhis compassion and his goodness, had permitted his father to be still\namong the living, how he would have run, how he would have precipitated\nhimself, how he would have cried to his father: “Father! Here I am! It\nis I! I have the same heart as thou! I am thy son!” How he would have\nembraced that white head, bathed his hair in tears, gazed upon his\nscar, pressed his hands, adored his garment, kissed his feet! Oh! Why\nhad his father died so early, before his time, before the justice, the\nlove of his son had come to him? Marius had a continual sob in his\nheart, which said to him every moment: “Alas!” At the same time, he\nbecame more truly serious, more truly grave, more sure of his thought\nand his faith. At each instant, gleams of the true came to complete his\nreason. An inward growth seemed to be in progress within him. He was\nconscious of a sort of natural enlargement, which gave him two things\nthat were new to him—his father and his country.\n\nAs everything opens when one has a key, so he explained to himself that\nwhich he had hated, he penetrated that which he had abhorred;\nhenceforth he plainly perceived the providential, divine and human\nsense of the great things which he had been taught to detest, and of\nthe great men whom he had been instructed to curse. When he reflected\non his former opinions, which were but those of yesterday, and which,\nnevertheless, seemed to him already so very ancient, he grew indignant,\nyet he smiled.\n\nFrom the rehabilitation of his father, he naturally passed to the\nrehabilitation of Napoleon.\n\nBut the latter, we will confess, was not effected without labor.\n\nFrom his infancy, he had been imbued with the judgments of the party of\n1814, on Bonaparte. Now, all the prejudices of the Restoration, all its\ninterests, all its instincts tended to disfigure Napoleon. It execrated\nhim even more than it did Robespierre. It had very cleverly turned to\nsufficiently good account the fatigue of the nation, and the hatred of\nmothers. Bonaparte had become an almost fabulous monster, and in order\nto paint him to the imagination of the people, which, as we lately\npointed out, resembles the imagination of children, the party of 1814\nmade him appear under all sorts of terrifying masks in succession, from\nthat which is terrible though it remains grandiose to that which is\nterrible and becomes grotesque, from Tiberius to the bugaboo. Thus, in\nspeaking of Bonaparte, one was free to sob or to puff up with laughter,\nprovided that hatred lay at the bottom. Marius had never\nentertained—about _that man_, as he was called—any other ideas in his\nmind. They had combined with the tenacity which existed in his nature.\nThere was in him a headstrong little man who hated Napoleon.\n\nOn reading history, on studying him, especially in the documents and\nmaterials for history, the veil which concealed Napoleon from the eyes\nof Marius was gradually rent. He caught a glimpse of something immense,\nand he suspected that he had been deceived up to that moment, on the\nscore of Bonaparte as about all the rest; each day he saw more\ndistinctly; and he set about mounting, slowly, step by step, almost\nregretfully in the beginning, then with intoxication and as though\nattracted by an irresistible fascination, first the sombre steps, then\nthe vaguely illuminated steps, at last the luminous and splendid steps\nof enthusiasm.\n\nOne night, he was alone in his little chamber near the roof. His candle\nwas burning; he was reading, with his elbows resting on his table close\nto the open window. All sorts of reveries reached him from space, and\nmingled with his thoughts. What a spectacle is the night! One hears\ndull sounds, without knowing whence they proceed; one beholds Jupiter,\nwhich is twelve hundred times larger than the earth, glowing like a\nfirebrand, the azure is black, the stars shine; it is formidable.\n\nHe was perusing the bulletins of the grand army, those heroic strophes\npenned on the field of battle; there, at intervals, he beheld his\nfather’s name, always the name of the Emperor; the whole of that great\nEmpire presented itself to him; he felt a flood swelling and rising\nwithin him; it seemed to him at moments that his father passed close to\nhim like a breath, and whispered in his ear; he gradually got into a\nsingular state; he thought that he heard drums, cannon, trumpets, the\nmeasured tread of battalions, the dull and distant gallop of the\ncavalry; from time to time, his eyes were raised heavenward, and gazed\nupon the colossal constellations as they gleamed in the measureless\ndepths of space, then they fell upon his book once more, and there they\nbeheld other colossal things moving confusedly. His heart contracted\nwithin him. He was in a transport, trembling, panting. All at once,\nwithout himself knowing what was in him, and what impulse he was\nobeying, he sprang to his feet, stretched both arms out of the window,\ngazed intently into the gloom, the silence, the infinite darkness, the\neternal immensity, and exclaimed: “Long live the Emperor!”\n\n\nFrom that moment forth, all was over; the Ogre of Corsica,—the\nusurper,—the tyrant,—the monster who was the lover of his own\nsisters,—the actor who took lessons of Talma,—the poisoner of\nJaffa,—the tiger,—Buonaparte,—all this vanished, and gave place in his\nmind to a vague and brilliant radiance in which shone, at an\ninaccessible height, the pale marble phantom of Cæsar. The Emperor had\nbeen for his father only the well-beloved captain whom one admires, for\nwhom one sacrifices one’s self; he was something more to Marius. He was\nthe predestined constructor of the French group, succeeding the Roman\ngroup in the domination of the universe. He was a prodigious architect,\nof a destruction, the continuer of Charlemagne, of Louis XI., of Henry\nIV., of Richelieu, of Louis XIV., and of the Committee of Public\nSafety, having his spots, no doubt, his faults, his crimes even, being\na man, that is to say; but august in his faults, brilliant in his\nspots, powerful in his crime.\n\nHe was the predestined man, who had forced all nations to say: “The\ngreat nation!” He was better than that, he was the very incarnation of\nFrance, conquering Europe by the sword which he grasped, and the world\nby the light which he shed. Marius saw in Bonaparte the dazzling\nspectre which will always rise upon the frontier, and which will guard\nthe future. Despot but dictator; a despot resulting from a republic and\nsumming up a revolution. Napoleon became for him the man-people as\nJesus Christ is the man-God.\n\nIt will be perceived, that like all new converts to a religion, his\nconversion intoxicated him, he hurled himself headlong into adhesion\nand he went too far. His nature was so constructed; once on the\ndownward slope, it was almost impossible for him to put on the drag.\nFanaticism for the sword took possession of him, and complicated in his\nmind his enthusiasm for the idea. He did not perceive that, along with\ngenius, and pell-mell, he was admitting force, that is to say, that he\nwas installing in two compartments of his idolatry, on the one hand\nthat which is divine, on the other that which is brutal. In many\nrespects, he had set about deceiving himself otherwise. He admitted\neverything. There is a way of encountering error while on one’s way to\nthe truth. He had a violent sort of good faith which took everything in\nthe lump. In the new path which he had entered on, in judging the\nmistakes of the old regime, as in measuring the glory of Napoleon, he\nneglected the attenuating circumstances.\n\nAt all events, a tremendous step had been taken. Where he had formerly\nbeheld the fall of the monarchy, he now saw the advent of France. His\norientation had changed. What had been his East became the West. He had\nturned squarely round.\n\nAll these revolutions were accomplished within him, without his family\nobtaining an inkling of the case.\n\nWhen, during this mysterious labor, he had entirely shed his old\nBourbon and ultra skin, when he had cast off the aristocrat, the\nJacobite and the Royalist, when he had become thoroughly a\nrevolutionist, profoundly democratic and republican, he went to an\nengraver on the Quai des Orfévres and ordered a hundred cards bearing\nthis name: _Le Baron Marius Pontmercy_.\n\nThis was only the strictly logical consequence of the change which had\ntaken place in him, a change in which everything gravitated round his\nfather.\n\nOnly, as he did not know any one and could not sow his cards with any\nporter, he put them in his pocket.\n\nBy another natural consequence, in proportion as he drew nearer to his\nfather, to the latter’s memory, and to the things for which the colonel\nhad fought five and twenty years before, he receded from his\ngrandfather. We have long ago said, that M. Gillenormand’s temper did\nnot please him. There already existed between them all the dissonances\nof the grave young man and the frivolous old man. The gayety of Géronte\nshocks and exasperates the melancholy of Werther. So long as the same\npolitical opinions and the same ideas had been common to them both,\nMarius had met M. Gillenormand there as on a bridge. When the bridge\nfell, an abyss was formed. And then, over and above all, Marius\nexperienced unutterable impulses to revolt, when he reflected that it\nwas M. Gillenormand who had, from stupid motives, torn him ruthlessly\nfrom the colonel, thus depriving the father of the child, and the child\nof the father.\n\nBy dint of pity for his father, Marius had nearly arrived at aversion\nfor his grandfather.\n\nNothing of this sort, however, was betrayed on the exterior, as we have\nalready said. Only he grew colder and colder; laconic at meals, and\nrare in the house. When his aunt scolded him for it, he was very gentle\nand alleged his studies, his lectures, the examinations, etc., as a\npretext. His grandfather never departed from his infallible diagnosis:\n“In love! I know all about it.”\n\n\nFrom time to time Marius absented himself.\n\n“Where is it that he goes off like this?” said his aunt.\n\nOn one of these trips, which were always very brief, he went to\nMontfermeil, in order to obey the injunction which his father had left\nhim, and he sought the old sergeant to Waterloo, the inn-keeper\nThénardier. Thénardier had failed, the inn was closed, and no one knew\nwhat had become of him. Marius was away from the house for four days on\nthis quest.\n\n“He is getting decidedly wild,” said his grandfather.\n\nThey thought they had noticed that he wore something on his breast,\nunder his shirt, which was attached to his neck by a black ribbon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—SOME PETTICOAT\n\n\nWe have mentioned a lancer.\n\nHe was a great-grand-nephew of M. Gillenormand, on the paternal side,\nwho led a garrison life, outside the family and far from the domestic\nhearth. Lieutenant Théodule Gillenormand fulfilled all the conditions\nrequired to make what is called a fine officer. He had “a lady’s\nwaist,” a victorious manner of trailing his sword and of twirling his\nmoustache in a hook. He visited Paris very rarely, and so rarely that\nMarius had never seen him. The cousins knew each other only by name. We\nthink we have said that Théodule was the favorite of Aunt Gillenormand,\nwho preferred him because she did not see him. Not seeing people\npermits one to attribute to them all possible perfections.\n\nOne morning, Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder returned to her\napartment as much disturbed as her placidity was capable of allowing.\nMarius had just asked his grandfather’s permission to take a little\ntrip, adding that he meant to set out that very evening. “Go!” had been\nhis grandfather’s reply, and M. Gillenormand had added in an aside, as\nhe raised his eyebrows to the top of his forehead: “Here he is passing\nthe night out again.” Mademoiselle Gillenormand had ascended to her\nchamber greatly puzzled, and on the staircase had dropped this\nexclamation: “This is too much!”—and this interrogation: “But where is\nit that he goes?” She espied some adventure of the heart, more or less\nillicit, a woman in the shadow, a rendezvous, a mystery, and she would\nnot have been sorry to thrust her spectacles into the affair. Tasting a\nmystery resembles getting the first flavor of a scandal; sainted souls\ndo not detest this. There is some curiosity about scandal in the secret\ncompartments of bigotry.\n\nSo she was the prey of a vague appetite for learning a history.\n\nIn order to get rid of this curiosity which agitated her a little\nbeyond her wont, she took refuge in her talents, and set about\nscalloping, with one layer of cotton after another, one of those\nembroideries of the Empire and the Restoration, in which there are\nnumerous cart-wheels. The work was clumsy, the worker cross. She had\nbeen seated at this for several hours when the door opened.\nMademoiselle Gillenormand raised her nose. Lieutenant Théodule stood\nbefore her, making the regulation salute. She uttered a cry of delight.\nOne may be old, one may be a prude, one may be pious, one may be an\naunt, but it is always agreeable to see a lancer enter one’s chamber.\n\n“You here, Théodule!” she exclaimed.\n\n“On my way through town, aunt.”\n\n\n“Embrace me.”\n\n\n“Here goes!” said Théodule.\n\nAnd he kissed her. Aunt Gillenormand went to her writing-desk and\nopened it.\n\n“You will remain with us a week at least?”\n\n\n“I leave this very evening, aunt.”\n\n\n“It is not possible!”\n\n\n“Mathematically!”\n\n\n“Remain, my little Théodule, I beseech you.”\n\n\n“My heart says ‘yes,’ but my orders say ‘no.’ The matter is simple.\nThey are changing our garrison; we have been at Melun, we are being\ntransferred to Gaillon. It is necessary to pass through Paris in order\nto get from the old post to the new one. I said: ‘I am going to see my\naunt.’”\n\n\n“Here is something for your trouble.”\n\n\nAnd she put ten louis into his hand.\n\n“For my pleasure, you mean to say, my dear aunt.”\n\n\nThéodule kissed her again, and she experienced the joy of having some\nof the skin scratched from her neck by the braidings on his uniform.\n\n“Are you making the journey on horseback, with your regiment?” she\nasked him.\n\n“No, aunt. I wanted to see you. I have special permission. My servant\nis taking my horse; I am travelling by diligence. And, by the way, I\nwant to ask you something.”\n\n\n“What is it?”\n\n\n“Is my cousin Marius Pontmercy travelling so, too?”\n\n\n“How do you know that?” said his aunt, suddenly pricked to the quick\nwith a lively curiosity.\n\n“On my arrival, I went to the diligence to engage my seat in the\ncoupé.”\n\n\n“Well?”\n\n\n“A traveller had already come to engage a seat in the imperial. I saw\nhis name on the card.”\n\n\n“What name?”\n\n\n“Marius Pontmercy.”\n\n\n“The wicked fellow!” exclaimed his aunt. “Ah! your cousin is not a\nsteady lad like yourself. To think that he is to pass the night in a\ndiligence!”\n\n\n“Just as I am going to do.”\n\n\n“But you—it is your duty; in his case, it is wildness.”\n\n\n“Bosh!” said Théodule.\n\nHere an event occurred to Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder,—an idea\nstruck her. If she had been a man, she would have slapped her brow. She\napostrophized Théodule:—\n\n“Are you aware whether your cousin knows you?”\n\n\n“No. I have seen him; but he has never deigned to notice me.”\n\n\n“So you are going to travel together?”\n\n\n“He in the imperial, I in the coupé.”\n\n\n“Where does this diligence run?”\n\n\n“To Andelys.”\n\n\n“Then that is where Marius is going?”\n\n\n“Unless, like myself, he should stop on the way. I get down at Vernon,\nin order to take the branch coach for Gaillon. I know nothing of\nMarius’ plan of travel.”\n\n\n“Marius! what an ugly name! what possessed them to name him Marius?\nWhile you, at least, are called Théodule.”\n\n\n“I would rather be called Alfred,” said the officer.\n\n“Listen, Théodule.”\n\n\n“I am listening, aunt.”\n\n\n“Pay attention.”\n\n\n“I am paying attention.”\n\n\n“You understand?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Well, Marius absents himself!”\n\n\n“Eh! eh!”\n\n\n“He travels.”\n\n\n“Ah! ah!”\n\n\n“He spends the night out.”\n\n\n“Oh! oh!”\n\n\n“We should like to know what there is behind all this.”\n\n\nThéodule replied with the composure of a man of bronze:—\n\n“Some petticoat or other.”\n\n\nAnd with that inward laugh which denotes certainty, he added:—\n\n“A lass.”\n\n\n“That is evident,” exclaimed his aunt, who thought she heard M.\nGillenormand speaking, and who felt her conviction become irresistible\nat that word _fillette_, accentuated in almost the very same fashion by\nthe granduncle and the grandnephew. She resumed:—\n\n“Do us a favor. Follow Marius a little. He does not know you, it will\nbe easy. Since a lass there is, try to get a sight of her. You must\nwrite us the tale. It will amuse his grandfather.”\n\n\nThéodule had no excessive taste for this sort of spying; but he was\nmuch touched by the ten louis, and he thought he saw a chance for a\npossible sequel. He accepted the commission and said: “As you please,\naunt.”\n\n\nAnd he added in an aside, to himself: “Here I am a duenna.”\n\n\nMademoiselle Gillenormand embraced him.\n\n“You are not the man to play such pranks, Théodule. You obey\ndiscipline, you are the slave of orders, you are a man of scruples and\nduty, and you would not quit your family to go and see a creature.”\n\n\nThe lancer made the pleased grimace of Cartouche when praised for his\nprobity.\n\nMarius, on the evening following this dialogue, mounted the diligence\nwithout suspecting that he was watched. As for the watcher, the first\nthing he did was to fall asleep. His slumber was complete and\nconscientious. Argus snored all night long.\n\nAt daybreak, the conductor of the diligence shouted: “Vernon! relay of\nVernon! Travellers for Vernon!” And Lieutenant Théodule woke.\n\n“Good,” he growled, still half asleep, “this is where I get out.”\n\n\nThen, as his memory cleared by degrees, the effect of waking, he\nrecalled his aunt, the ten louis, and the account which he had\nundertaken to render of the deeds and proceedings of Marius. This set\nhim to laughing.\n\n“Perhaps he is no longer in the coach,” he thought, as he rebuttoned\nthe waistcoat of his undress uniform. “He may have stopped at Poissy;\nhe may have stopped at Triel; if he did not get out at Meulan, he may\nhave got out at Mantes, unless he got out at Rolleboise, or if he did\nnot go on as far as Pacy, with the choice of turning to the left at\nÉvreus, or to the right at Laroche-Guyon. Run after him, aunty. What\nthe devil am I to write to that good old soul?”\n\n\nAt that moment a pair of black trousers descending from the imperial,\nmade its appearance at the window of the coupé.\n\n“Can that be Marius?” said the lieutenant.\n\nIt was Marius.\n\nA little peasant girl, all entangled with the horses and the postilions\nat the end of the vehicle, was offering flowers to the travellers.\n“Give your ladies flowers!” she cried.\n\nMarius approached her and purchased the finest flowers in her flat\nbasket.\n\n“Come now,” said Théodule, leaping down from the coupé, “this piques my\ncuriosity. Who the deuce is he going to carry those flowers to? She\nmust be a splendidly handsome woman for so fine a bouquet. I want to\nsee her.”\n\n\nAnd no longer in pursuance of orders, but from personal curiosity, like\ndogs who hunt on their own account, he set out to follow Marius.\n\nMarius paid no attention to Théodule. Elegant women descended from the\ndiligence; he did not glance at them. He seemed to see nothing around\nhim.\n\n“He is pretty deeply in love!” thought Théodule.\n\nMarius directed his steps towards the church.\n\n“Capital,” said Théodule to himself. “Rendezvous seasoned with a bit of\nmass are the best sort. Nothing is so exquisite as an ogle which passes\nover the good God’s head.”\n\n\nOn arriving at the church, Marius did not enter it, but skirted the\napse. He disappeared behind one of the angles of the apse.\n\n“The rendezvous is appointed outside,” said Théodule. “Let’s have a\nlook at the lass.”\n\n\nAnd he advanced on the tips of his boots towards the corner which\nMarius had turned.\n\nOn arriving there, he halted in amazement.\n\nMarius, with his forehead clasped in his hands, was kneeling upon the\ngrass on a grave. He had strewn his bouquet there. At the extremity of\nthe grave, on a little swelling which marked the head, there stood a\ncross of black wood with this name in white letters: COLONEL BARON\nPONTMERCY. Marius’ sobs were audible.\n\nThe “lass” was a grave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—MARBLE AGAINST GRANITE\n\n\nIt was hither that Marius had come on the first occasion of his\nabsenting himself from Paris. It was hither that he had come every time\nthat M. Gillenormand had said: “He is sleeping out.”\n\n\nLieutenant Théodule was absolutely put out of countenance by this\nunexpected encounter with a sepulchre; he experienced a singular and\ndisagreeable sensation which he was incapable of analyzing, and which\nwas composed of respect for the tomb, mingled with respect for the\ncolonel. He retreated, leaving Marius alone in the cemetery, and there\nwas discipline in this retreat. Death appeared to him with large\nepaulets, and he almost made the military salute to him. Not knowing\nwhat to write to his aunt, he decided not to write at all; and it is\nprobable that nothing would have resulted from the discovery made by\nThéodule as to the love affairs of Marius, if, by one of those\nmysterious arrangements which are so frequent in chance, the scene at\nVernon had not had an almost immediate counter-shock at Paris.\n\nMarius returned from Vernon on the third day, in the middle of the\nmorning, descended at his grandfather’s door, and, wearied by the two\nnights spent in the diligence, and feeling the need of repairing his\nloss of sleep by an hour at the swimming-school, he mounted rapidly to\nhis chamber, took merely time enough to throw off his travelling-coat,\nand the black ribbon which he wore round his neck, and went off to the\nbath.\n\nM. Gillenormand, who had risen betimes like all old men in good health,\nhad heard his entrance, and had made haste to climb, as quickly as his\nold legs permitted, the stairs to the upper story where Marius lived,\nin order to embrace him, and to question him while so doing, and to\nfind out where he had been.\n\nBut the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man had to\nascend, and when Father Gillenormand entered the attic, Marius was no\nlonger there.\n\nThe bed had not been disturbed, and on the bed lay, outspread, but not\ndefiantly the great-coat and the black ribbon.\n\n“I like this better,” said M. Gillenormand.\n\nAnd a moment later, he made his entrance into the salon, where\nMademoiselle Gillenormand was already seated, busily embroidering her\ncart-wheels.\n\nThe entrance was a triumphant one.\n\nM. Gillenormand held in one hand the great-coat, and in the other the\nneck-ribbon, and exclaimed:—\n\n“Victory! We are about to penetrate the mystery! We are going to learn\nthe most minute details; we are going to lay our finger on the\ndebaucheries of our sly friend! Here we have the romance itself. I have\nthe portrait!”\n\n\nIn fact, a case of black shagreen, resembling a medallion portrait, was\nsuspended from the ribbon.\n\nThe old man took this case and gazed at it for some time without\nopening it, with that air of enjoyment, rapture, and wrath, with which\na poor hungry fellow beholds an admirable dinner which is not for him,\npass under his very nose.\n\n“For this evidently is a portrait. I know all about such things. That\nis worn tenderly on the heart. How stupid they are! Some abominable\nfright that will make us shudder, probably! Young men have such bad\ntaste nowadays!”\n\n\n“Let us see, father,” said the old spinster.\n\nThe case opened by the pressure of a spring. They found in it nothing\nbut a carefully folded paper.\n\n_“From the same to the same,”_ said M. Gillenormand, bursting with\nlaughter. “I know what it is. A billet-doux.”\n\n\n“Ah! let us read it!” said the aunt.\n\nAnd she put on her spectacles. They unfolded the paper and read as\nfollows:—\n\n“_For my son_.—The Emperor made me a Baron on the battlefield of\nWaterloo. Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which I\npurchased with my blood, my son shall take it and bear it. That he will\nbe worthy of it is a matter of course.”\n\n\nThe feelings of father and daughter cannot be described. They felt\nchilled as by the breath of a death’s-head. They did not exchange a\nword.\n\nOnly, M. Gillenormand said in a low voice and as though speaking to\nhimself:—\n\n“It is the slasher’s handwriting.”\n\n\nThe aunt examined the paper, turned it about in all directions, then\nput it back in its case.\n\nAt the same moment a little oblong packet, enveloped in blue paper,\nfell from one of the pockets of the great-coat. Mademoiselle\nGillenormand picked it up and unfolded the blue paper.\n\nIt contained Marius’ hundred cards. She handed one of them to M.\nGillenormand, who read: _Le Baron Marius Pontmercy_.\n\nThe old man rang the bell. Nicolette came. M. Gillenormand took the\nribbon, the case, and the coat, flung them all on the floor in the\nmiddle of the room, and said:—\n\n“Carry those duds away.”\n\n\nA full hour passed in the most profound silence. The old man and the\nold spinster had seated themselves with their backs to each other, and\nwere thinking, each on his own account, the same things, in all\nprobability.\n\nAt the expiration of this hour, Aunt Gillenormand said:—“A pretty state\nof things!”\n\n\nA few moments later, Marius made his appearance. He entered. Even\nbefore he had crossed the threshold, he saw his grandfather holding one\nof his own cards in his hand, and on catching sight of him, the latter\nexclaimed with his air of bourgeois and grinning superiority which was\nsomething crushing:—\n\n“Well! well! well! well! well! so you are a baron now. I present you my\ncompliments. What is the meaning of this?”\n\n\nMarius reddened slightly and replied:—\n\n“It means that I am the son of my father.”\n\n\nM. Gillenormand ceased to laugh, and said harshly:—\n\n“I am your father.”\n\n\n“My father,” retorted Marius, with downcast eyes and a severe air, “was\na humble and heroic man, who served the Republic and France gloriously,\nwho was great in the greatest history that men have ever made, who\nlived in the bivouac for a quarter of a century, beneath grape-shot and\nbullets, in snow and mud by day, beneath rain at night, who captured\ntwo flags, who received twenty wounds, who died forgotten and\nabandoned, and who never committed but one mistake, which was to love\ntoo fondly two ingrates, his country and myself.”\n\n\nThis was more than M. Gillenormand could bear to hear. At the word\n_republic_, he rose, or, to speak more correctly, he sprang to his\nfeet. Every word that Marius had just uttered produced on the visage of\nthe old Royalist the effect of the puffs of air from a forge upon a\nblazing brand. From a dull hue he had turned red, from red, purple, and\nfrom purple, flame-colored.\n\n“Marius!” he cried. “Abominable child! I do not know what your father\nwas! I do not wish to know! I know nothing about that, and I do not\nknow him! But what I do know is, that there never was anything but\nscoundrels among those men! They were all rascals, assassins, red-caps,\nthieves! I say all! I say all! I know not one! I say all! Do you hear\nme, Marius! See here, you are no more a baron than my slipper is! They\nwere all bandits in the service of Robespierre! All who served\nB-u-o-naparté were brigands! They were all traitors who betrayed,\nbetrayed, betrayed their legitimate king! All cowards who fled before\nthe Prussians and the English at Waterloo! That is what I do know!\nWhether Monsieur your father comes in that category, I do not know! I\nam sorry for it, so much the worse, your humble servant!”\n\n\nIn his turn, it was Marius who was the firebrand and M. Gillenormand\nwho was the bellows. Marius quivered in every limb, he did not know\nwhat would happen next, his brain was on fire. He was the priest who\nbeholds all his sacred wafers cast to the winds, the fakir who beholds\na passer-by spit upon his idol. It could not be that such things had\nbeen uttered in his presence. What was he to do? His father had just\nbeen trampled under foot and stamped upon in his presence, but by whom?\nBy his grandfather. How was he to avenge the one without outraging the\nother? It was impossible for him to insult his grandfather and it was\nequally impossible for him to leave his father unavenged. On the one\nhand was a sacred grave, on the other hoary locks.\n\nHe stood there for several moments, staggering as though intoxicated,\nwith all this whirlwind dashing through his head; then he raised his\neyes, gazed fixedly at his grandfather, and cried in a voice of\nthunder:—\n\n“Down with the Bourbons, and that great hog of a Louis XVIII.!”\n\n\nLouis XVIII. had been dead for four years; but it was all the same to\nhim.\n\nThe old man, who had been crimson, turned whiter than his hair. He\nwheeled round towards a bust of M. le Duc de Berry, which stood on the\nchimney-piece, and made a profound bow, with a sort of peculiar\nmajesty. Then he paced twice, slowly and in silence, from the fireplace\nto the window and from the window to the fireplace, traversing the\nwhole length of the room, and making the polished floor creak as though\nhe had been a stone statue walking.\n\nOn his second turn, he bent over his daughter, who was watching this\nencounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb, and said to her\nwith a smile that was almost calm: “A baron like this gentleman, and a\nbourgeois like myself cannot remain under the same roof.”\n\n\nAnd drawing himself up, all at once, pallid, trembling, terrible, with\nhis brow rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath, he\nextended his arm towards Marius and shouted to him:—\n\n“Be off!”\n\n\nMarius left the house.\n\nOn the following day, M. Gillenormand said to his daughter:\n\n“You will send sixty pistoles every six months to that blood-drinker,\nand you will never mention his name to me.”\n\n\nHaving an immense reserve fund of wrath to get rid of, and not knowing\nwhat to do with it, he continued to address his daughter as _you_\ninstead of _thou_ for the next three months.\n\nMarius, on his side, had gone forth in indignation. There was one\ncircumstance which, it must be admitted, aggravated his exasperation.\nThere are always petty fatalities of the sort which complicate domestic\ndramas. They augment the grievances in such cases, although, in\nreality, the wrongs are not increased by them. While carrying Marius’\n“duds” precipitately to his chamber, at his grandfather’s command,\nNicolette had, inadvertently, let fall, probably, on the attic\nstaircase, which was dark, that medallion of black shagreen which\ncontained the paper penned by the colonel. Neither paper nor case could\nafterwards be found. Marius was convinced that “Monsieur\nGillenormand”—from that day forth he never alluded to him otherwise—had\nflung “his father’s testament” in the fire. He knew by heart the few\nlines which the colonel had written, and, consequently, nothing was\nlost. But the paper, the writing, that sacred relic,—all that was his\nvery heart. What had been done with it?\n\nMarius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going, and\nwithout knowing where, with thirty francs, his watch, and a few clothes\nin a hand-bag. He had entered a hackney-coach, had engaged it by the\nhour, and had directed his course at hap-hazard towards the Latin\nquarter.\n\nWhat was to become of Marius?\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTH—THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—A GROUP WHICH BARELY MISSED BECOMING HISTORIC\n\n\nAt that epoch, which was, to all appearances indifferent, a certain\nrevolutionary quiver was vaguely current. Breaths which had started\nforth from the depths of ’89 and ’93 were in the air. Youth was on the\npoint, may the reader pardon us the word, of moulting. People were\nundergoing a transformation, almost without being conscious of it,\nthrough the movement of the age. The needle which moves round the\ncompass also moves in souls. Each person was taking that step in\nadvance which he was bound to take. The Royalists were becoming\nliberals, liberals were turning democrats. It was a flood tide\ncomplicated with a thousand ebb movements; the peculiarity of ebbs is\nto create intermixtures; hence the combination of very singular ideas;\npeople adored both Napoleon and liberty. We are making history here.\nThese were the mirages of that period. Opinions traverse phases.\nVoltairian royalism, a quaint variety, had a no less singular sequel,\nBonapartist liberalism.\n\nOther groups of minds were more serious. In that direction, they\nsounded principles, they attached themselves to the right. They grew\nenthusiastic for the absolute, they caught glimpses of infinite\nrealizations; the absolute, by its very rigidity, urges spirits towards\nthe sky and causes them to float in illimitable space. There is nothing\nlike dogma for bringing forth dreams. And there is nothing like dreams\nfor engendering the future. Utopia to-day, flesh and blood to-morrow.\n\nThese advanced opinions had a double foundation. A beginning of mystery\nmenaced “the established order of things,” which was suspicious and\nunderhand. A sign which was revolutionary to the highest degree. The\nsecond thoughts of power meet the second thoughts of the populace in\nthe mine. The incubation of insurrections gives the retort to the\npremeditation of _coups d‘état_.\n\nThere did not, as yet, exist in France any of those vast underlying\norganizations, like the German _tugendbund_ and Italian Carbonarism;\nbut here and there there were dark underminings, which were in process\nof throwing off shoots. The Cougourde was being outlined at Aix; there\nexisted at Paris, among other affiliations of that nature, the society\nof the Friends of the A B C.\n\nWhat were these Friends of the A B C? A society which had for its\nobject apparently the education of children, in reality the elevation\nof man.\n\nThey declared themselves the Friends of the A B C,—the _Abaissé_,—the\ndebased,—that is to say, the people. They wished to elevate the people.\nIt was a pun which we should do wrong to smile at. Puns are sometimes\nserious factors in politics; witness the _Castratus ad castra_, which\nmade a general of the army of Narses; witness: _Barbari et Barberini_;\nwitness: _Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram_, etc., etc.\n\nThe Friends of the A B C were not numerous, it was a secret society in\nthe state of embryo, we might almost say a coterie, if coteries ended\nin heroes. They assembled in Paris in two localities, near the\nfish-market, in a wine-shop called _Corinthe_, of which more will be\nheard later on, and near the Pantheon in a little café in the Rue\nSaint-Michel called the _Café Musain_, now torn down; the first of\nthese meeting-places was close to the workingman, the second to the\nstudents.\n\nThe assemblies of the Friends of the A B C were usually held in a back\nroom of the Café Musain.\n\nThis hall, which was tolerably remote from the café, with which it was\nconnected by an extremely long corridor, had two windows and an exit\nwith a private stairway on the little Rue des Grès. There they smoked\nand drank, and gambled and laughed. There they conversed in very loud\ntones about everything, and in whispers of other things. An old map of\nFrance under the Republic was nailed to the wall,—a sign quite\nsufficient to excite the suspicion of a police agent.\n\nThe greater part of the Friends of the A B C were students, who were on\ncordial terms with the working classes. Here are the names of the\nprincipal ones. They belong, in a certain measure, to history:\nEnjolras, Combeferre, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly, Courfeyrac, Bahorel,\nLesgle or Laigle, Joly, Grantaire.\n\nThese young men formed a sort of family, through the bond of\nfriendship. All, with the exception of Laigle, were from the South.\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nFriends of the a B C  3b4-1-abc-friends\n\n\nThis was a remarkable group. It vanished in the invisible depths which\nlie behind us. At the point of this drama which we have now reached, it\nwill not perhaps be superfluous to throw a ray of light upon these\nyouthful heads, before the reader beholds them plunging into the shadow\nof a tragic adventure.\n\nEnjolras, whose name we have mentioned first of all,—the reader shall\nsee why later on,—was an only son and wealthy.\n\nEnjolras was a charming young man, who was capable of being terrible.\nHe was angelically handsome. He was a savage Antinous. One would have\nsaid, to see the pensive thoughtfulness of his glance, that he had\nalready, in some previous state of existence, traversed the\nrevolutionary apocalypse. He possessed the tradition of it as though he\nhad been a witness. He was acquainted with all the minute details of\nthe great affair. A pontifical and warlike nature, a singular thing in\na youth. He was an officiating priest and a man of war; from the\nimmediate point of view, a soldier of the democracy; above the\ncontemporary movement, the priest of the ideal. His eyes were deep, his\nlids a little red, his lower lip was thick and easily became\ndisdainful, his brow was lofty. A great deal of brow in a face is like\na great deal of horizon in a view. Like certain young men at the\nbeginning of this century and the end of the last, who became\nillustrious at an early age, he was endowed with excessive youth, and\nwas as rosy as a young girl, although subject to hours of pallor.\nAlready a man, he still seemed a child. His two and twenty years\nappeared to be but seventeen; he was serious, it did not seem as though\nhe were aware there was on earth a thing called woman. He had but one\npassion—the right; but one thought—to overthrow the obstacle. On Mount\nAventine, he would have been Gracchus; in the Convention, he would have\nbeen Saint-Just. He hardly saw the roses, he ignored spring, he did not\nhear the carolling of the birds; the bare throat of Evadne would have\nmoved him no more than it would have moved Aristogeiton; he, like\nHarmodius, thought flowers good for nothing except to conceal the\nsword. He was severe in his enjoyments. He chastely dropped his eyes\nbefore everything which was not the Republic. He was the marble lover\nof liberty. His speech was harshly inspired, and had the thrill of a\nhymn. He was subject to unexpected outbursts of soul. Woe to the\nlove-affair which should have risked itself beside him! If any grisette\nof the Place Cambrai or the Rue Saint-Jean-de-Beauvais, seeing that\nface of a youth escaped from college, that page’s mien, those long,\ngolden lashes, those blue eyes, that hair billowing in the wind, those\nrosy cheeks, those fresh lips, those exquisite teeth, had conceived an\nappetite for that complete aurora, and had tried her beauty on\nEnjolras, an astounding and terrible glance would have promptly shown\nher the abyss, and would have taught her not to confound the mighty\ncherub of Ezekiel with the gallant Cherubino of Beaumarchais.\n\nBy the side of Enjolras, who represented the logic of the Revolution,\nCombeferre represented its philosophy. Between the logic of the\nRevolution and its philosophy there exists this difference—that its\nlogic may end in war, whereas its philosophy can end only in peace.\nCombeferre complemented and rectified Enjolras. He was less lofty, but\nbroader. He desired to pour into all minds the extensive principles of\ngeneral ideas: he said: “Revolution, but civilization”; and around the\nmountain peak he opened out a vast view of the blue sky. The Revolution\nwas more adapted for breathing with Combeferre than with Enjolras.\nEnjolras expressed its divine right, and Combeferre its natural right.\nThe first attached himself to Robespierre; the second confined himself\nto Condorcet. Combeferre lived the life of all the rest of the world\nmore than did Enjolras. If it had been granted to these two young men\nto attain to history, the one would have been the just, the other the\nwise man. Enjolras was the more virile, Combeferre the more humane.\n_Homo_ and _vir_, that was the exact effect of their different shades.\nCombeferre was as gentle as Enjolras was severe, through natural\nwhiteness. He loved the word _citizen_, but he preferred the word\n_man_. He would gladly have said: _Hombre_, like the Spanish. He read\neverything, went to the theatres, attended the courses of public\nlecturers, learned the polarization of light from Arago, grew\nenthusiastic over a lesson in which Geoffroy Sainte-Hilaire explained\nthe double function of the external carotid artery, and the internal,\nthe one which makes the face, and the one which makes the brain; he\nkept up with what was going on, followed science step by step, compared\nSaint-Simon with Fourier, deciphered hieroglyphics, broke the pebble\nwhich he found and reasoned on geology, drew from memory a silkworm\nmoth, pointed out the faulty French in the Dictionary of the Academy,\nstudied Puységur and Deleuze, affirmed nothing, not even miracles;\ndenied nothing, not even ghosts; turned over the files of the\n_Moniteur_, reflected. He declared that the future lies in the hand of\nthe schoolmaster, and busied himself with educational questions. He\ndesired that society should labor without relaxation at the elevation\nof the moral and intellectual level, at coining science, at putting\nideas into circulation, at increasing the mind in youthful persons, and\nhe feared lest the present poverty of method, the paltriness from a\nliterary point of view confined to two or three centuries called\nclassic, the tyrannical dogmatism of official pedants, scholastic\nprejudices and routines should end by converting our colleges into\nartificial oyster beds. He was learned, a purist, exact, a graduate of\nthe Polytechnic, a close student, and at the same time, thoughtful\n“even to chimæras,” so his friends said. He believed in all dreams,\nrailroads, the suppression of suffering in chirurgical operations, the\nfixing of images in the dark chamber, the electric telegraph, the\nsteering of balloons. Moreover, he was not much alarmed by the citadels\nerected against the human mind in every direction, by superstition,\ndespotism, and prejudice. He was one of those who think that science\nwill eventually turn the position. Enjolras was a chief, Combeferre was\na guide. One would have liked to fight under the one and to march\nbehind the other. It is not that Combeferre was not capable of\nfighting, he did not refuse a hand-to-hand combat with the obstacle,\nand to attack it by main force and explosively; but it suited him\nbetter to bring the human race into accord with its destiny gradually,\nby means of education, the inculcation of axioms, the promulgation of\npositive laws; and, between two lights, his preference was rather for\nillumination than for conflagration. A conflagration can create an\naurora, no doubt, but why not await the dawn? A volcano illuminates,\nbut daybreak furnishes a still better illumination. Possibly,\nCombeferre preferred the whiteness of the beautiful to the blaze of the\nsublime. A light troubled by smoke, progress purchased at the expense\nof violence, only half satisfied this tender and serious spirit. The\nheadlong precipitation of a people into the truth, a ‘93, terrified\nhim; nevertheless, stagnation was still more repulsive to him, in it he\ndetected putrefaction and death; on the whole, he preferred scum to\nmiasma, and he preferred the torrent to the cesspool, and the falls of\nNiagara to the lake of Montfaucon. In short, he desired neither halt\nnor haste. While his tumultuous friends, captivated by the absolute,\nadored and invoked splendid revolutionary adventures, Combeferre was\ninclined to let progress, good progress, take its own course; he may\nhave been cold, but he was pure; methodical, but irreproachable;\nphlegmatic, but imperturbable. Combeferre would have knelt and clasped\nhis hands to enable the future to arrive in all its candor, and that\nnothing might disturb the immense and virtuous evolution of the races.\n_The good must be innocent_, he repeated incessantly. And in fact, if\nthe grandeur of the Revolution consists in keeping the dazzling ideal\nfixedly in view, and of soaring thither athwart the lightnings, with\nfire and blood in its talons, the beauty of progress lies in being\nspotless; and there exists between Washington, who represents the one,\nand Danton, who incarnates the other, that difference which separates\nthe swan from the angel with the wings of an eagle.\n\nJean Prouvaire was a still softer shade than Combeferre. His name was\nJehan, owing to that petty momentary freak which mingled with the\npowerful and profound movement whence sprang the very essential study\nof the Middle Ages. Jean Prouvaire was in love; he cultivated a pot of\nflowers, played on the flute, made verses, loved the people, pitied\nwoman, wept over the child, confounded God and the future in the same\nconfidence, and blamed the Revolution for having caused the fall of a\nroyal head, that of André Chénier. His voice was ordinarily delicate,\nbut suddenly grew manly. He was learned even to erudition, and almost\nan Orientalist. Above all, he was good; and, a very simple thing to\nthose who know how nearly goodness borders on grandeur, in the matter\nof poetry, he preferred the immense. He knew Italian, Latin, Greek, and\nHebrew; and these served him only for the perusal of four poets: Dante,\nJuvenal, Æschylus, and Isaiah. In French, he preferred Corneille to\nRacine, and Agrippa d’Aubigné to Corneille. He loved to saunter through\nfields of wild oats and corn-flowers, and busied himself with clouds\nnearly as much as with events. His mind had two attitudes, one on the\nside towards man, the other on that towards God; he studied or he\ncontemplated. All day long, he buried himself in social questions,\nsalary, capital, credit, marriage, religion, liberty of thought,\neducation, penal servitude, poverty, association, property, production\nand sharing, the enigma of this lower world which covers the human\nant-hill with darkness; and at night, he gazed upon the planets, those\nenormous beings. Like Enjolras, he was wealthy and an only son. He\nspoke softly, bowed his head, lowered his eyes, smiled with\nembarrassment, dressed badly, had an awkward air, blushed at a mere\nnothing, and was very timid. Yet he was intrepid.\n\nFeuilly was a workingman, a fan-maker, orphaned both of father and\nmother, who earned with difficulty three francs a day, and had but one\nthought, to deliver the world. He had one other preoccupation, to\neducate himself; he called this also, delivering himself. He had taught\nhimself to read and write; everything that he knew, he had learned by\nhimself. Feuilly had a generous heart. The range of his embrace was\nimmense. This orphan had adopted the peoples. As his mother had failed\nhim, he meditated on his country. He brooded with the profound\ndivination of the man of the people, over what we now call the _idea of\nthe nationality_, had learned history with the express object of raging\nwith full knowledge of the case. In this club of young Utopians,\noccupied chiefly with France, he represented the outside world. He had\nfor his specialty Greece, Poland, Hungary, Roumania, Italy. He uttered\nthese names incessantly, appropriately and inappropriately, with the\ntenacity of right. The violations of Turkey on Greece and Thessaly, of\nRussia on Warsaw, of Austria on Venice, enraged him. Above all things,\nthe great violence of 1772 aroused him. There is no more sovereign\neloquence than the true in indignation; he was eloquent with that\neloquence. He was inexhaustible on that infamous date of 1772, on the\nsubject of that noble and valiant race suppressed by treason, and that\nthree-sided crime, on that monstrous ambush, the prototype and pattern\nof all those horrible suppressions of states, which, since that time,\nhave struck many a noble nation, and have annulled their certificate of\nbirth, so to speak. All contemporary social crimes have their origin in\nthe partition of Poland. The partition of Poland is a theorem of which\nall present political outrages are the corollaries. There has not been\na despot, nor a traitor for nearly a century back, who has not signed,\napproved, counter-signed, and copied, _ne variatur_, the partition of\nPoland. When the record of modern treasons was examined, that was the\nfirst thing which made its appearance. The congress of Vienna consulted\nthat crime before consummating its own. 1772 sounded the onset; 1815\nwas the death of the game. Such was Feuilly’s habitual text. This poor\nworkingman had constituted himself the tutor of Justice, and she\nrecompensed him by rendering him great. The fact is, that there is\neternity in right. Warsaw can no more be Tartar than Venice can be\nTeuton. Kings lose their pains and their honor in the attempt to make\nthem so. Sooner or later, the submerged part floats to the surface and\nreappears. Greece becomes Greece again, Italy is once more Italy. The\nprotest of right against the deed persists forever. The theft of a\nnation cannot be allowed by prescription. These lofty deeds of\nrascality have no future. A nation cannot have its mark extracted like\na pocket handkerchief.\n\nCourfeyrac had a father who was called M. de Courfeyrac. One of the\nfalse ideas of the bourgeoisie under the Restoration as regards\naristocracy and the nobility was to believe in the particle. The\nparticle, as every one knows, possesses no significance. But the\nbourgeois of the epoch of _la Minerve_ estimated so highly that poor\n_de_, that they thought themselves bound to abdicate it. M. de\nChauvelin had himself called M. Chauvelin; M. de Caumartin, M.\nCaumartin; M. de Constant de Robecque, Benjamin Constant; M. de\nLafayette, M. Lafayette. Courfeyrac had not wished to remain behind the\nrest, and called himself plain Courfeyrac.\n\nWe might almost, so far as Courfeyrac is concerned, stop here, and\nconfine ourselves to saying with regard to what remains: “For\nCourfeyrac, see Tholomyès.”\n\n\nCourfeyrac had, in fact, that animation of youth which may be called\nthe _beauté du diable_ of the mind. Later on, this disappears like the\nplayfulness of the kitten, and all this grace ends, with the bourgeois,\non two legs, and with the tomcat, on four paws.\n\nThis sort of wit is transmitted from generation to generation of the\nsuccessive levies of youth who traverse the schools, who pass it from\nhand to hand, _quasi cursores_, and is almost always exactly the same;\nso that, as we have just pointed out, any one who had listened to\nCourfeyrac in 1828 would have thought he heard Tholomyès in 1817. Only,\nCourfeyrac was an honorable fellow. Beneath the apparent similarities\nof the exterior mind, the difference between him and Tholomyès was very\ngreat. The latent man which existed in the two was totally different in\nthe first from what it was in the second. There was in Tholomyès a\ndistrict attorney, and in Courfeyrac a paladin.\n\nEnjolras was the chief, Combeferre was the guide, Courfeyrac was the\ncentre. The others gave more light, he shed more warmth; the truth is,\nthat he possessed all the qualities of a centre, roundness and\nradiance.\n\nBahorel had figured in the bloody tumult of June, 1822, on the occasion\nof the burial of young Lallemand.\n\nBahorel was a good-natured mortal, who kept bad company, brave, a\nspendthrift, prodigal, and to the verge of generosity, talkative, and\nat times eloquent, bold to the verge of effrontery; the best fellow\npossible; he had daring waistcoats, and scarlet opinions; a wholesale\nblusterer, that is to say, loving nothing so much as a quarrel, unless\nit were an uprising; and nothing so much as an uprising, unless it were\na revolution; always ready to smash a window-pane, then to tear up the\npavement, then to demolish a government, just to see the effect of it;\na student in his eleventh year. He had nosed about the law, but did not\npractise it. He had taken for his device: “Never a lawyer,” and for his\narmorial bearings a nightstand in which was visible a square cap. Every\ntime that he passed the law-school, which rarely happened, he buttoned\nup his frock-coat,—the paletot had not yet been invented,—and took\nhygienic precautions. Of the school porter he said: “What a fine old\nman!” and of the dean, M. Delvincourt: “What a monument!” In his\nlectures he espied subjects for ballads, and in his professors\noccasions for caricature. He wasted a tolerably large allowance,\nsomething like three thousand francs a year, in doing nothing.\n\nHe had peasant parents whom he had contrived to imbue with respect for\ntheir son.\n\nHe said of them: “They are peasants and not bourgeois; that is the\nreason they are intelligent.”\n\n\nBahorel, a man of caprice, was scattered over numerous cafés; the\nothers had habits, he had none. He sauntered. To stray is human. To\nsaunter is Parisian. In reality, he had a penetrating mind and was more\nof a thinker than appeared to view.\n\nHe served as a connecting link between the Friends of the A B C and\nother still unorganized groups, which were destined to take form later\non.\n\nIn this conclave of young heads, there was one bald member.\n\nThe Marquis d’Avaray, whom Louis XVIII. made a duke for having assisted\nhim to enter a hackney-coach on the day when he emigrated, was wont to\nrelate, that in 1814, on his return to France, as the King was\ndisembarking at Calais, a man handed him a petition.\n\n“What is your request?” said the King.\n\n“Sire, a post-office.”\n\n\n“What is your name?”\n\n\n“L’Aigle.”\n\n\nThe King frowned, glanced at the signature of the petition and beheld\nthe name written thus: LESGLE. This non-Bonaparte orthography touched\nthe King and he began to smile. “Sire,” resumed the man with the\npetition, “I had for ancestor a keeper of the hounds surnamed\nLesgueules. This surname furnished my name. I am called Lesgueules, by\ncontraction Lesgle, and by corruption l’Aigle.” This caused the King to\nsmile broadly. Later on he gave the man the posting office of Meaux,\neither intentionally or accidentally.\n\nThe bald member of the group was the son of this Lesgle, or Légle, and\nhe signed himself, Légle [de Meaux]. As an abbreviation, his companions\ncalled him Bossuet.\n\nBossuet was a gay but unlucky fellow. His specialty was not to succeed\nin anything. As an offset, he laughed at everything. At five and twenty\nhe was bald. His father had ended by owning a house and a field; but\nhe, the son, had made haste to lose that house and field in a bad\nspeculation. He had nothing left. He possessed knowledge and wit, but\nall he did miscarried. Everything failed him and everybody deceived\nhim; what he was building tumbled down on top of him. If he were\nsplitting wood, he cut off a finger. If he had a mistress, he speedily\ndiscovered that he had a friend also. Some misfortune happened to him\nevery moment, hence his joviality. He said: “I live under falling\ntiles.” He was not easily astonished, because, for him, an accident was\nwhat he had foreseen, he took his bad luck serenely, and smiled at the\nteasing of fate, like a person who is listening to pleasantries. He was\npoor, but his fund of good humor was inexhaustible. He soon reached his\nlast sou, never his last burst of laughter. When adversity entered his\ndoors, he saluted this old acquaintance cordially, he tapped all\ncatastrophes on the stomach; he was familiar with fatality to the point\nof calling it by its nickname: “Good day, Guignon,” he said to it.\n\nThese persecutions of fate had rendered him inventive. He was full of\nresources. He had no money, but he found means, when it seemed good to\nhim, to indulge in “unbridled extravagance.” One night, he went so far\nas to eat a “hundred francs” in a supper with a wench, which inspired\nhim to make this memorable remark in the midst of the orgy: “Pull off\nmy boots, you five-louis jade.”\n\n\nBossuet was slowly directing his steps towards the profession of a\nlawyer; he was pursuing his law studies after the manner of Bahorel.\nBossuet had not much domicile, sometimes none at all. He lodged now\nwith one, now with another, most often with Joly. Joly was studying\nmedicine. He was two years younger than Bossuet.\n\nJoly was the “malade imaginaire” junior. What he had won in medicine\nwas to be more of an invalid than a doctor. At three and twenty he\nthought himself a valetudinarian, and passed his life in inspecting his\ntongue in the mirror. He affirmed that man becomes magnetic like a\nneedle, and in his chamber he placed his bed with its head to the\nsouth, and the foot to the north, so that, at night, the circulation of\nhis blood might not be interfered with by the great electric current of\nthe globe. During thunder storms, he felt his pulse. Otherwise, he was\nthe gayest of them all. All these young, maniacal, puny, merry\nincoherences lived in harmony together, and the result was an eccentric\nand agreeable being whom his comrades, who were prodigal of winged\nconsonants, called Jolllly. “You may fly away on the four _L’s_,” Jean\nProuvaire said to him.23\n\nJoly had a trick of touching his nose with the tip of his cane, which\nis an indication of a sagacious mind.\n\nAll these young men who differed so greatly, and who, on the whole, can\nonly be discussed seriously, held the same religion: Progress.\n\nAll were the direct sons of the French Revolution. The most giddy of\nthem became solemn when they pronounced that date: ’89. Their fathers\nin the flesh had been, either royalists, doctrinaires, it matters not\nwhat; this confusion anterior to themselves, who were young, did not\nconcern them at all; the pure blood of principle ran in their veins.\nThey attached themselves, without intermediate shades, to incorruptible\nright and absolute duty.\n\nAffiliated and initiated, they sketched out the ideal underground.\n\nAmong all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds, there\nwas one sceptic. How came he there? By juxtaposition. This sceptic’s\nname was Grantaire, and he was in the habit of signing himself with\nthis rebus: R. Grantaire was a man who took good care not to believe in\nanything. Moreover, he was one of the students who had learned the most\nduring their course at Paris; he knew that the best coffee was to be\nhad at the Café Lemblin, and the best billiards at the Café Voltaire,\nthat good cakes and lasses were to be found at the Ermitage, on the\nBoulevard du Maine, spatchcocked chickens at Mother Sauget’s, excellent\nmatelotes at the Barrière de la Cunette, and a certain thin white wine\nat the Barrière du Compat. He knew the best place for everything; in\naddition, boxing and foot-fencing and some dances; and he was a\nthorough single-stick player. He was a tremendous drinker to boot. He\nwas inordinately homely: the prettiest boot-stitcher of that day, Irma\nBoissy, enraged with his homeliness, pronounced sentence on him as\nfollows: “Grantaire is impossible”; but Grantaire’s fatuity was not to\nbe disconcerted. He stared tenderly and fixedly at all women, with the\nair of saying to them all: “If I only chose!” and of trying to make his\ncomrades believe that he was in general demand.\n\nAll those words: rights of the people, rights of man, the social\ncontract, the French Revolution, the Republic, democracy, humanity,\ncivilization, religion, progress, came very near to signifying nothing\nwhatever to Grantaire. He smiled at them. Scepticism, that caries of\nthe intelligence, had not left him a single whole idea. He lived with\nirony. This was his axiom: “There is but one certainty, my full glass.”\nHe sneered at all devotion in all parties, the father as well as the\nbrother, Robespierre junior as well as Loizerolles. “They are greatly\nin advance to be dead,” he exclaimed. He said of the crucifix: “There\nis a gibbet which has been a success.” A rover, a gambler, a libertine,\noften drunk, he displeased these young dreamers by humming incessantly:\n“J’aimons les filles, et j’aimons le bon vin.” Air: Vive Henri IV.\n\nHowever, this sceptic had one fanaticism. This fanaticism was neither a\ndogma, nor an idea, nor an art, nor a science; it was a man: Enjolras.\nGrantaire admired, loved, and venerated Enjolras. To whom did this\nanarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute minds? To\nthe most absolute. In what manner had Enjolras subjugated him? By his\nideas? No. By his character. A phenomenon which is often observable. A\nsceptic who adheres to a believer is as simple as the law of\ncomplementary colors. That which we lack attracts us. No one loves the\nlight like the blind man. The dwarf adores the drum-major. The toad\nalways has his eyes fixed on heaven. Why? In order to watch the bird in\nits flight. Grantaire, in whom writhed doubt, loved to watch faith soar\nin Enjolras. He had need of Enjolras. That chaste, healthy, firm,\nupright, hard, candid nature charmed him, without his being clearly\naware of it, and without the idea of explaining it to himself having\noccurred to him. He admired his opposite by instinct. His soft,\nyielding, dislocated, sickly, shapeless ideas attached themselves to\nEnjolras as to a spinal column. His moral backbone leaned on that\nfirmness. Grantaire in the presence of Enjolras became some one once\nmore. He was, himself, moreover, composed of two elements, which were,\nto all appearance, incompatible. He was ironical and cordial. His\nindifference loved. His mind could get along without belief, but his\nheart could not get along without friendship. A profound contradiction;\nfor an affection is a conviction. His nature was thus constituted.\nThere are men who seem to be born to be the reverse, the obverse, the\nwrong side. They are Pollux, Patrocles, Nisus, Eudamidas, Ephestion,\nPechmeja. They only exist on condition that they are backed up with\nanother man; their name is a sequel, and is only written preceded by\nthe conjunction _and_; and their existence is not their own; it is the\nother side of an existence which is not theirs. Grantaire was one of\nthese men. He was the obverse of Enjolras.\n\nOne might almost say that affinities begin with the letters of the\nalphabet. In the series O and P are inseparable. You can, at will,\npronounce O and P or Orestes and Pylades.\n\nGrantaire, Enjolras’ true satellite, inhabited this circle of young\nmen; he lived there, he took no pleasure anywhere but there; he\nfollowed them everywhere. His joy was to see these forms go and come\nthrough the fumes of wine. They tolerated him on account of his good\nhumor.\n\nEnjolras, the believer, disdained this sceptic; and, a sober man\nhimself, scorned this drunkard. He accorded him a little lofty pity.\nGrantaire was an unaccepted Pylades. Always harshly treated by\nEnjolras, roughly repulsed, rejected yet ever returning to the charge,\nhe said of Enjolras: “What fine marble!”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—BLONDEAU’S FUNERAL ORATION BY BOSSUET\n\n\nOn a certain afternoon, which had, as will be seen hereafter, some\ncoincidence with the events heretofore related, Laigle de Meaux was to\nbe seen leaning in a sensual manner against the doorpost of the Café\nMusain. He had the air of a caryatid on a vacation; he carried nothing\nbut his reverie, however. He was staring at the Place Saint-Michel. To\nlean one’s back against a thing is equivalent to lying down while\nstanding erect, which attitude is not hated by thinkers. Laigle de\nMeaux was pondering without melancholy, over a little misadventure\nwhich had befallen him two days previously at the law-school, and which\nhad modified his personal plans for the future, plans which were rather\nindistinct in any case.\n\nReverie does not prevent a cab from passing by, nor the dreamer from\ntaking note of that cab. Laigle de Meaux, whose eyes were straying\nabout in a sort of diffuse lounging, perceived, athwart his\nsomnambulism, a two-wheeled vehicle proceeding through the place, at a\nfoot pace and apparently in indecision. For whom was this cabriolet?\nWhy was it driving at a walk? Laigle took a survey. In it, beside the\ncoachman, sat a young man, and in front of the young man lay a rather\nbulky hand-bag. The bag displayed to passers-by the following name\ninscribed in large black letters on a card which was sewn to the stuff:\nMARIUS PONTMERCY.\n\nThis name caused Laigle to change his attitude. He drew himself up and\nhurled this apostrophe at the young man in the cabriolet:—\n\n“Monsieur Marius Pontmercy!”\n\n\nThe cabriolet thus addressed came to a halt.\n\nThe young man, who also seemed deeply buried in thought, raised his\neyes:—\n\n“Hey?” said he.\n\n“You are M. Marius Pontmercy?”\n\n\n“Certainly.”\n\n\n“I was looking for you,” resumed Laigle de Meaux.\n\n“How so?” demanded Marius; for it was he: in fact, he had just quitted\nhis grandfather’s, and had before him a face which he now beheld for\nthe first time. “I do not know you.”\n\n\n“Neither do I know you,” responded Laigle.\n\nMarius thought he had encountered a wag, the beginning of a\nmystification in the open street. He was not in a very good humor at\nthe moment. He frowned. Laigle de Meaux went on imperturbably:—\n\n“You were not at the school day before yesterday.”\n\n\n“That is possible.”\n\n\n“That is certain.”\n\n\n“You are a student?” demanded Marius.\n\n“Yes, sir. Like yourself. Day before yesterday, I entered the school,\nby chance. You know, one does have such freaks sometimes. The professor\nwas just calling the roll. You are not unaware that they are very\nridiculous on such occasions. At the third call, unanswered, your name\nis erased from the list. Sixty francs in the gulf.”\n\n\nMarius began to listen.\n\n“It was Blondeau who was making the call. You know Blondeau, he has a\nvery pointed and very malicious nose, and he delights to scent out the\nabsent. He slyly began with the letter P. I was not listening, not\nbeing compromised by that letter. The call was not going badly. No\nerasures; the universe was present. Blondeau was grieved. I said to\nmyself: ‘Blondeau, my love, you will not get the very smallest sort of\nan execution to-day.’ All at once Blondeau calls, ‘Marius Pontmercy!’\nNo one answers. Blondeau, filled with hope, repeats more loudly:\n‘Marius Pontmercy!’ And he takes his pen. Monsieur, I have bowels of\ncompassion. I said to myself hastily: ‘Here’s a brave fellow who is\ngoing to get scratched out. Attention. Here is a veritable mortal who\nis not exact. He’s not a good student. Here is none of your\nheavy-sides, a student who studies, a greenhorn pedant, strong on\nletters, theology, science, and sapience, one of those dull wits cut by\nthe square; a pin by profession. He is an honorable idler who lounges,\nwho practises country jaunts, who cultivates the grisette, who pays\ncourt to the fair sex, who is at this very moment, perhaps, with my\nmistress. Let us save him. Death to Blondeau!’ At that moment, Blondeau\ndipped his pen in, all black with erasures in the ink, cast his yellow\neyes round the audience room, and repeated for the third time: ‘Marius\nPontmercy!’ I replied: ‘Present!’ This is why you were not crossed\noff.”\n\n\n“Monsieur!—” said Marius.\n\n“And why I was,” added Laigle de Meaux.\n\n“I do not understand you,” said Marius.\n\nLaigle resumed:—\n\n“Nothing is more simple. I was close to the desk to reply, and close to\nthe door for the purpose of flight. The professor gazed at me with a\ncertain intensity. All of a sudden, Blondeau, who must be the malicious\nnose alluded to by Boileau, skipped to the letter L. L is my letter. I\nam from Meaux, and my name is Lesgle.”\n\n\n“L’Aigle!” interrupted Marius, “what fine name!”\n\n\n“Monsieur, Blondeau came to this fine name, and called: ‘Laigle!’ I\nreply: ‘Present!’ Then Blondeau gazes at me, with the gentleness of a\ntiger, and says to me: ‘If you are Pontmercy, you are not Laigle.’ A\nphrase which has a disobliging air for you, but which was lugubrious\nonly for me. That said, he crossed me off.”\n\n\nMarius exclaimed:—\n\n“I am mortified, sir—”\n\n\n“First of all,” interposed Laigle, “I demand permission to embalm\nBlondeau in a few phrases of deeply felt eulogium. I will assume that\nhe is dead. There will be no great change required in his gauntness, in\nhis pallor, in his coldness, and in his smell. And I say: ‘_Erudimini\nqui judicatis terram_. Here lies Blondeau, Blondeau the Nose, Blondeau\nNasica, the ox of discipline, _bos disciplinæ_, the bloodhound of the\npassword, the angel of the roll-call, who was upright, square, exact,\nrigid, honest, and hideous. God crossed him off as he crossed me off.’”\n\n\nMarius resumed:—\n\n“I am very sorry—”\n\n\n“Young man,” said Laigle de Meaux, “let this serve you as a lesson. In\nfuture, be exact.”\n\n\n“I really beg you a thousand pardons.”\n\n\n“Do not expose your neighbor to the danger of having his name erased\nagain.”\n\n\n“I am extremely sorry—”\n\n\nLaigle burst out laughing.\n\n“And I am delighted. I was on the brink of becoming a lawyer. This\nerasure saves me. I renounce the triumphs of the bar. I shall not\ndefend the widow, and I shall not attack the orphan. No more toga, no\nmore stage. Here is my erasure all ready for me. It is to you that I am\nindebted for it, Monsieur Pontmercy. I intend to pay a solemn call of\nthanks upon you. Where do you live?”\n\n\n“In this cab,” said Marius.\n\n“A sign of opulence,” retorted Laigle calmly. “I congratulate you. You\nhave there a rent of nine thousand francs per annum.”\n\n\nAt that moment, Courfeyrac emerged from the café.\n\nMarius smiled sadly.\n\n“I have paid this rent for the last two hours, and I aspire to get rid\nof it; but there is a sort of history attached to it, and I don’t know\nwhere to go.”\n\n\n“Come to my place, sir,” said Courfeyrac.\n\n“I have the priority,” observed Laigle, “but I have no home.”\n\n\n“Hold your tongue, Bossuet,” said Courfeyrac.\n\n“Bossuet,” said Marius, “but I thought that your name was Laigle.”\n\n\n“De Meaux,” replied Laigle; “by metaphor, Bossuet.”\n\n\nCourfeyrac entered the cab.\n\n“Coachman,” said he, “hotel de la Porte-Saint-Jacques.”\n\n\nAnd that very evening, Marius found himself installed in a chamber of\nthe hotel de la Porte-Saint-Jacques side by side with Courfeyrac.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—MARIUS’ ASTONISHMENTS\n\n\nIn a few days, Marius had become Courfeyrac’s friend. Youth is the\nseason for prompt welding and the rapid healing of scars. Marius\nbreathed freely in Courfeyrac’s society, a decidedly new thing for him.\nCourfeyrac put no questions to him. He did not even think of such a\nthing. At that age, faces disclose everything on the spot. Words are\nsuperfluous. There are young men of whom it can be said that their\ncountenances chatter. One looks at them and one knows them.\n\nOne morning, however, Courfeyrac abruptly addressed this interrogation\nto him:—\n\n“By the way, have you any political opinions?”\n\n\n“The idea!” said Marius, almost affronted by the question.\n\n“What are you?”\n\n\n“A democrat-Bonapartist.”\n\n\n“The gray hue of a reassured rat,” said Courfeyrac.\n\nOn the following day, Courfeyrac introduced Marius at the Café Musain.\nThen he whispered in his ear, with a smile: “I must give you your entry\nto the revolution.” And he led him to the hall of the Friends of the A\nB C. He presented him to the other comrades, saying this simple word\nwhich Marius did not understand: “A pupil.”\n\n\nMarius had fallen into a wasps’-nest of wits. However, although he was\nsilent and grave, he was, nonetheless, both winged and armed.\n\nMarius, up to that time solitary and inclined to soliloquy, and to\nasides, both by habit and by taste, was a little fluttered by this\ncovey of young men around him. All these various initiatives solicited\nhis attention at once, and pulled him about. The tumultuous movements\nof these minds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl.\nSometimes, in his trouble, they fled so far from him, that he had\ndifficulty in recovering them. He heard them talk of philosophy, of\nliterature, of art, of history, of religion, in unexpected fashion. He\ncaught glimpses of strange aspects; and, as he did not place them in\nproper perspective, he was not altogether sure that it was not chaos\nthat he grasped. On abandoning his grandfather’s opinions for the\nopinions of his father, he had supposed himself fixed; he now\nsuspected, with uneasiness, and without daring to avow it to himself,\nthat he was not. The angle at which he saw everything began to be\ndisplaced anew. A certain oscillation set all the horizons of his\nbrains in motion. An odd internal upsetting. He almost suffered from\nit.\n\nIt seemed as though there were no “consecrated things” for those young\nmen. Marius heard singular propositions on every sort of subject, which\nembarrassed his still timid mind.\n\nA theatre poster presented itself, adorned with the title of a tragedy\nfrom the ancient repertory called classic: “Down with tragedy dear to\nthe bourgeois!” cried Bahorel. And Marius heard Combeferre reply:—\n\n“You are wrong, Bahorel. The bourgeoisie loves tragedy, and the\nbourgeoisie must be left at peace on that score. Bewigged tragedy has a\nreason for its existence, and I am not one of those who, by order of\nÆschylus, contest its right to existence. There are rough outlines in\nnature; there are, in creation, ready-made parodies; a beak which is\nnot a beak, wings which are not wings, gills which are not gills, paws\nwhich are not paws, a cry of pain which arouses a desire to laugh,\nthere is the duck. Now, since poultry exists by the side of the bird, I\ndo not see why classic tragedy should not exist in the face of antique\ntragedy.”\n\n\nOr chance decreed that Marius should traverse Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau\nbetween Enjolras and Courfeyrac.\n\nCourfeyrac took his arm:—\n\n“Pay attention. This is the Rue Plâtrière, now called Rue Jean-Jacques\nRousseau, on account of a singular household which lived in it sixty\nyears ago. This consisted of Jean-Jacques and Thérèse. From time to\ntime, little beings were born there. Thérèse gave birth to them,\nJean-Jacques represented them as foundlings.”\n\n\nAnd Enjolras addressed Courfeyrac roughly:—\n\n“Silence in the presence of Jean-Jacques! I admire that man. He denied\nhis own children, that may be; but he adopted the people.”\n\n\nNot one of these young men articulated the word: The Emperor. Jean\nProuvaire alone sometimes said Napoleon; all the others said\n“Bonaparte.” Enjolras pronounced it “Buonaparte.”\n\n\nMarius was vaguely surprised. _Initium sapientiæ_.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—THE BACK ROOM OF THE CAFÉ MUSAIN\n\n\nOne of the conversations among the young men, at which Marius was\npresent and in which he sometimes joined, was a veritable shock to his\nmind.\n\nThis took place in the back room of the Café Musain. Nearly all the\nFriends of the A B C had convened that evening. The argand lamp was\nsolemnly lighted. They talked of one thing and another, without passion\nand with noise. With the exception of Enjolras and Marius, who held\ntheir peace, all were haranguing rather at hap-hazard. Conversations\nbetween comrades sometimes are subject to these peaceable tumults. It\nwas a game and an uproar as much as a conversation. They tossed words\nto each other and caught them up in turn. They were chattering in all\nquarters.\n\nNo woman was admitted to this back room, except Louison, the\ndish-washer of the café, who passed through it from time to time, to go\nto her washing in the “lavatory.”\n\n\nGrantaire, thoroughly drunk, was deafening the corner of which he had\ntaken possession, reasoning and contradicting at the top of his lungs,\nand shouting:—\n\n“I am thirsty. Mortals, I am dreaming: that the tun of Heidelberg has\nan attack of apoplexy, and that I am one of the dozen leeches which\nwill be applied to it. I want a drink. I desire to forget life. Life is\na hideous invention of I know not whom. It lasts no time at all, and is\nworth nothing. One breaks one’s neck in living. Life is a theatre set\nin which there are but few practicable entrances. Happiness is an\nantique reliquary painted on one side only. Ecclesiastes says: ‘All is\nvanity.’ I agree with that good man, who never existed, perhaps. Zero\nnot wishing to go stark naked, clothed himself in vanity. O vanity! The\npatching up of everything with big words! a kitchen is a laboratory, a\ndancer is a professor, an acrobat is a gymnast, a boxer is a pugilist,\nan apothecary is a chemist, a wigmaker is an artist, a hodman is an\narchitect, a jockey is a sportsman, a wood-louse is a pterigybranche.\nVanity has a right and a wrong side; the right side is stupid, it is\nthe negro with his glass beads; the wrong side is foolish, it is the\nphilosopher with his rags. I weep over the one and I laugh over the\nother. What are called honors and dignities, and even dignity and\nhonor, are generally of pinchbeck. Kings make playthings of human\npride. Caligula made a horse a consul; Charles II. made a knight of a\nsirloin. Wrap yourself up now, then, between Consul Incitatus and\nBaronet Roastbeef. As for the intrinsic value of people, it is no\nlonger respectable in the least. Listen to the panegyric which neighbor\nmakes of neighbor. White on white is ferocious; if the lily could\nspeak, what a setting down it would give the dove! A bigoted woman\nprating of a devout woman is more venomous than the asp and the cobra.\nIt is a shame that I am ignorant, otherwise I would quote to you a mass\nof things; but I know nothing. For instance, I have always been witty;\nwhen I was a pupil of Gros, instead of daubing wretched little\npictures, I passed my time in pilfering apples; _rapin_24 is the\nmasculine of _rapine_. So much for myself; as for the rest of you, you\nare worth no more than I am. I scoff at your perfections, excellencies,\nand qualities. Every good quality tends towards a defect; economy\nborders on avarice, the generous man is next door to the prodigal, the\nbrave man rubs elbows with the braggart; he who says very pious says a\ntrifle bigoted; there are just as many vices in virtue as there are\nholes in Diogenes’ cloak. Whom do you admire, the slain or the slayer,\nCæsar or Brutus? Generally men are in favor of the slayer. Long live\nBrutus, he has slain! There lies the virtue. Virtue, granted, but\nmadness also. There are queer spots on those great men. The Brutus who\nkilled Cæsar was in love with the statue of a little boy. This statue\nwas from the hand of the Greek sculptor Strongylion, who also carved\nthat figure of an Amazon known as the Beautiful Leg, Eucnemos, which\nNero carried with him in his travels. This Strongylion left but two\nstatues which placed Nero and Brutus in accord. Brutus was in love with\nthe one, Nero with the other. All history is nothing but wearisome\nrepetition. One century is the plagiarist of the other. The battle of\nMarengo copies the battle of Pydna; the Tolbiac of Clovis and the\nAusterlitz of Napoleon are as like each other as two drops of water. I\ndon’t attach much importance to victory. Nothing is so stupid as to\nconquer; true glory lies in convincing. But try to prove something! If\nyou are content with success, what mediocrity, and with conquering,\nwhat wretchedness! Alas, vanity and cowardice everywhere. Everything\nobeys success, even grammar. _Si volet usus_, says Horace. Therefore I\ndisdain the human race. Shall we descend to the party at all? Do you\nwish me to begin admiring the peoples? What people, if you please?\nShall it be Greece? The Athenians, those Parisians of days gone by,\nslew Phocion, as we might say Coligny, and fawned upon tyrants to such\nan extent that Anacephorus said of Pisistratus: “His urine attracts the\nbees.” The most prominent man in Greece for fifty years was that\ngrammarian Philetas, who was so small and so thin that he was obliged\nto load his shoes with lead in order not to be blown away by the wind.\nThere stood on the great square in Corinth a statue carved by Silanion\nand catalogued by Pliny; this statue represented Episthates. What did\nEpisthates do? He invented a trip. That sums up Greece and glory. Let\nus pass on to others. Shall I admire England? Shall I admire France?\nFrance? Why? Because of Paris? I have just told you my opinion of\nAthens. England? Why? Because of London? I hate Carthage. And then,\nLondon, the metropolis of luxury, is the headquarters of wretchedness.\nThere are a hundred deaths a year of hunger in the parish of\nCharing-Cross alone. Such is Albion. I add, as the climax, that I have\nseen an Englishwoman dancing in a wreath of roses and blue spectacles.\nA fig then for England! If I do not admire John Bull, shall I admire\nBrother Jonathan? I have but little taste for that slave-holding\nbrother. Take away _Time is money_, what remains of England? Take away\n_Cotton is king_, what remains of America? Germany is the lymph, Italy\nis the bile. Shall we go into ecstasies over Russia? Voltaire admired\nit. He also admired China. I admit that Russia has its beauties, among\nothers, a stout despotism; but I pity the despots. Their health is\ndelicate. A decapitated Alexis, a poignarded Peter, a strangled Paul,\nanother Paul crushed flat with kicks, divers Ivans strangled, with\ntheir throats cut, numerous Nicholases and Basils poisoned, all this\nindicates that the palace of the Emperors of Russia is in a condition\nof flagrant insalubrity. All civilized peoples offer this detail to the\nadmiration of the thinker; war; now, war, civilized war, exhausts and\nsums up all the forms of ruffianism, from the brigandage of the\nTrabuceros in the gorges of Mont Jaxa to the marauding of the Comanche\nIndians in the Doubtful Pass. ‘Bah!’ you will say to me, ‘but Europe is\ncertainly better than Asia?’ I admit that Asia is a farce; but I do not\nprecisely see what you find to laugh at in the Grand Lama, you peoples\nof the west, who have mingled with your fashions and your elegances all\nthe complicated filth of majesty, from the dirty chemise of Queen\nIsabella to the chamber-chair of the Dauphin. Gentlemen of the human\nrace, I tell you, not a bit of it! It is at Brussels that the most beer\nis consumed, at Stockholm the most brandy, at Madrid the most\nchocolate, at Amsterdam the most gin, at London the most wine, at\nConstantinople the most coffee, at Paris the most absinthe; there are\nall the useful notions. Paris carries the day, in short. In Paris, even\nthe rag-pickers are sybarites; Diogenes would have loved to be a\nrag-picker of the Place Maubert better than to be a philosopher at the\nPiræus. Learn this in addition; the wineshops of the rag-pickers are\ncalled _bibines_; the most celebrated are the _Saucepan_ and _The\nSlaughter-House_. Hence, tea-gardens, goguettes, caboulots, bouibuis,\nmastroquets, bastringues, manezingues, bibines of the rag-pickers,\ncaravanseries of the caliphs, I certify to you, I am a voluptuary, I\neat at Richard’s at forty sous a head, I must have Persian carpets to\nroll naked Cleopatra in! Where is Cleopatra? Ah! So it is you, Louison.\nGood day.”\n\n\nThus did Grantaire, more than intoxicated, launch into speech, catching\nat the dish-washer in her passage, from his corner in the back room of\nthe Café Musain.\n\nBossuet, extending his hand towards him, tried to impose silence on\nhim, and Grantaire began again worse than ever:—\n\n“Aigle de Meaux, down with your paws. You produce on me no effect with\nyour gesture of Hippocrates refusing Artaxerxes’ bric-à-brac. I excuse\nyou from the task of soothing me. Moreover, I am sad. What do you wish\nme to say to you? Man is evil, man is deformed; the butterfly is a\nsuccess, man is a failure. God made a mistake with that animal. A crowd\noffers a choice of ugliness. The first comer is a wretch,\n_Femme_—woman—rhymes with _infâme_,—infamous. Yes, I have the spleen,\ncomplicated with melancholy, with homesickness, plus hypochondria, and\nI am vexed and I rage, and I yawn, and I am bored, and I am tired to\ndeath, and I am stupid! Let God go to the devil!”\n\n\n“Silence then, capital R!” resumed Bossuet, who was discussing a point\nof law behind the scenes, and who was plunged more than waist high in a\nphrase of judicial slang, of which this is the conclusion:—\n\n“—And as for me, although I am hardly a legist, and at the most, an\namateur attorney, I maintain this: that, in accordance with the terms\nof the customs of Normandy, at Saint-Michel, and for each year, an\nequivalent must be paid to the profit of the lord of the manor, saving\nthe rights of others, and by all and several, the proprietors as well\nas those seized with inheritance, and that, for all emphyteuses,\nleases, freeholds, contracts of domain, mortgages—”\n\n\n“Echo, plaintive nymph,” hummed Grantaire.\n\nNear Grantaire, an almost silent table, a sheet of paper, an inkstand\nand a pen between two glasses of brandy, announced that a vaudeville\nwas being sketched out.\n\nThis great affair was being discussed in a low voice, and the two heads\nat work touched each other: “Let us begin by finding names. When one\nhas the names, one finds the subject.”\n\n\n“That is true. Dictate. I will write.”\n\n\n“Monsieur Dorimon.”\n\n\n“An independent gentleman?”\n\n\n“Of course.”\n\n\n“His daughter, Célestine.”\n\n\n“—tine. What next?”\n\n\n“Colonel Sainval.”\n\n\n“Sainval is stale. I should say Valsin.”\n\n\nBeside the vaudeville aspirants, another group, which was also taking\nadvantage of the uproar to talk low, was discussing a duel. An old\nfellow of thirty was counselling a young one of eighteen, and\nexplaining to him what sort of an adversary he had to deal with.\n\n“The deuce! Look out for yourself. He is a fine swordsman. His play is\nneat. He has the attack, no wasted feints, wrist, dash, lightning, a\njust parade, mathematical parries, _bigre!_ and he is left-handed.”\n\n\nIn the angle opposite Grantaire, Joly and Bahorel were playing\ndominoes, and talking of love.\n\n“You are in luck, that you are,” Joly was saying. “You have a mistress\nwho is always laughing.”\n\n\n“That is a fault of hers,” returned Bahorel. “One’s mistress does wrong\nto laugh. That encourages one to deceive her. To see her gay removes\nyour remorse; if you see her sad, your conscience pricks you.”\n\n\n“Ingrate! a woman who laughs is such a good thing! And you never\nquarrel!”\n\n\n“That is because of the treaty which we have made. On forming our\nlittle Holy Alliance we assigned ourselves each our frontier, which we\nnever cross. What is situated on the side of winter belongs to Vaud, on\nthe side of the wind to Gex. Hence the peace.”\n\n\n“Peace is happiness digesting.”\n\n\n“And you, Jolllly, where do you stand in your entanglement with\nMamselle—you know whom I mean?”\n\n\n“She sulks at me with cruel patience.”\n\n\n“Yet you are a lover to soften the heart with gauntness.”\n\n\n“Alas!”\n\n\n“In your place, I would let her alone.”\n\n\n“That is easy enough to say.”\n\n\n“And to do. Is not her name Musichetta?”\n\n\n“Yes. Ah! my poor Bahorel, she is a superb girl, very literary, with\ntiny feet, little hands, she dresses well, and is white and dimpled,\nwith the eyes of a fortune-teller. I am wild over her.”\n\n\n“My dear fellow, then in order to please her, you must be elegant, and\nproduce effects with your knees. Buy a good pair of trousers of\ndouble-milled cloth at Staub’s. That will assist.”\n\n\n“At what price?” shouted Grantaire.\n\nThe third corner was delivered up to a poetical discussion. Pagan\nmythology was giving battle to Christian mythology. The question was\nabout Olympus, whose part was taken by Jean Prouvaire, out of pure\nromanticism.\n\nJean Prouvaire was timid only in repose. Once excited, he burst forth,\na sort of mirth accentuated his enthusiasm, and he was at once both\nlaughing and lyric.\n\n“Let us not insult the gods,” said he. “The gods may not have taken\ntheir departure. Jupiter does not impress me as dead. The gods are\ndreams, you say. Well, even in nature, such as it is to-day, after the\nflight of these dreams, we still find all the grand old pagan myths.\nSuch and such a mountain with the profile of a citadel, like the\nVignemale, for example, is still to me the headdress of Cybele; it has\nnot been proved to me that Pan does not come at night to breathe into\nthe hollow trunks of the willows, stopping up the holes in turn with\nhis fingers, and I have always believed that Io had something to do\nwith the cascade of Pissevache.”\n\n\nIn the last corner, they were talking politics. The Charter which had\nbeen granted was getting roughly handled. Combeferre was upholding it\nweakly. Courfeyrac was energetically making a breach in it. On the\ntable lay an unfortunate copy of the famous Touquet Charter. Courfeyrac\nhad seized it, and was brandishing it, mingling with his arguments the\nrattling of this sheet of paper.\n\n“In the first place, I won’t have any kings; if it were only from an\neconomical point of view, I don’t want any; a king is a parasite. One\ndoes not have kings gratis. Listen to this: the dearness of kings. At\nthe death of François I., the national debt of France amounted to an\nincome of thirty thousand livres; at the death of Louis XIV. it was two\nmilliards, six hundred millions, at twenty-eight livres the mark, which\nwas equivalent in 1760, according to Desmarets, to four milliards, five\nhundred millions, which would to-day be equivalent to twelve milliards.\nIn the second place, and no offence to Combeferre, a charter granted is\nbut a poor expedient of civilization. To save the transition, to soften\nthe passage, to deaden the shock, to cause the nation to pass\ninsensibly from the monarchy to democracy by the practice of\nconstitutional fictions,—what detestable reasons all those are! No! no!\nlet us never enlighten the people with false daylight. Principles\ndwindle and pale in your constitutional cellar. No illegitimacy, no\ncompromise, no grant from the king to the people. In all such grants\nthere is an Article 14. By the side of the hand which gives there is\nthe claw which snatches back. I refuse your charter point-blank. A\ncharter is a mask; the lie lurks beneath it. A people which accepts a\ncharter abdicates. The law is only the law when entire. No! no\ncharter!”\n\n\nIt was winter; a couple of fagots were crackling in the fireplace. This\nwas tempting, and Courfeyrac could not resist. He crumpled the poor\nTouquet Charter in his fist, and flung it in the fire. The paper\nflashed up. Combeferre watched the masterpiece of Louis XVIII. burn\nphilosophically, and contented himself with saying:—\n\n“The charter metamorphosed into flame.”\n\n\nAnd sarcasms, sallies, jests, that French thing which is called\n_entrain_, and that English thing which is called humor, good and bad\ntaste, good and bad reasons, all the wild pyrotechnics of dialogue,\nmounting together and crossing from all points of the room, produced a\nsort of merry bombardment over their heads.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—ENLARGEMENT OF HORIZON\n\n\nThe shocks of youthful minds among themselves have this admirable\nproperty, that one can never foresee the spark, nor divine the\nlightning flash. What will dart out presently? No one knows. The burst\nof laughter starts from a tender feeling.\n\nAt the moment of jest, the serious makes its entry. Impulses depend on\nthe first chance word. The spirit of each is sovereign, jest suffices\nto open the field to the unexpected. These are conversations with\nabrupt turns, in which the perspective changes suddenly. Chance is the\nstage-manager of such conversations.\n\nA severe thought, starting oddly from a clash of words, suddenly\ntraversed the conflict of quips in which Grantaire, Bahorel, Prouvaire,\nBossuet, Combeferre, and Courfeyrac were confusedly fencing.\n\nHow does a phrase crop up in a dialogue? Whence comes it that it\nsuddenly impresses itself on the attention of those who hear it? We\nhave just said, that no one knows anything about it. In the midst of\nthe uproar, Bossuet all at once terminated some apostrophe to\nCombeferre, with this date:—\n\n“June 18th, 1815, Waterloo.”\n\n\nAt this name of Waterloo, Marius, who was leaning his elbows on a\ntable, beside a glass of water, removed his wrist from beneath his\nchin, and began to gaze fixedly at the audience.\n\n“Pardieu!” exclaimed Courfeyrac (“Parbleu” was falling into disuse at\nthis period), “that number 18 is strange and strikes me. It is\nBonaparte’s fatal number. Place Louis in front and Brumaire behind, you\nhave the whole destiny of the man, with this significant peculiarity,\nthat the end treads close on the heels of the commencement.”\n\n\nEnjolras, who had remained mute up to that point, broke the silence and\naddressed this remark to Combeferre:—\n\n“You mean to say, the crime and the expiation.”\n\n\nThis word _crime_ overpassed the measure of what Marius, who was\nalready greatly agitated by the abrupt evocation of Waterloo, could\naccept.\n\nHe rose, walked slowly to the map of France spread out on the wall, and\nat whose base an island was visible in a separate compartment, laid his\nfinger on this compartment and said:—\n\n“Corsica, a little island which has rendered France very great.”\n\n\nThis was like a breath of icy air. All ceased talking. They felt that\nsomething was on the point of occurring.\n\nBahorel, replying to Bossuet, was just assuming an attitude of the\ntorso to which he was addicted. He gave it up to listen.\n\nEnjolras, whose blue eye was not fixed on any one, and who seemed to be\ngazing at space, replied, without glancing at Marius:—\n\n“France needs no Corsica to be great. France is great because she is\nFrance. _Quia nomina leo_.”\n\n\nMarius felt no desire to retreat; he turned towards Enjolras, and his\nvoice burst forth with a vibration which came from a quiver of his very\nbeing:—\n\n“God forbid that I should diminish France! But amalgamating Napoleon\nwith her is not diminishing her. Come! let us argue the question. I am\na newcomer among you, but I will confess that you amaze me. Where do we\nstand? Who are we? Who are you? Who am I? Let us come to an explanation\nabout the Emperor. I hear you say _Buonaparte_, accenting the _u_ like\nthe Royalists. I warn you that my grandfather does better still; he\nsays _Buonaparté_’. I thought you were young men. Where, then, is your\nenthusiasm? And what are you doing with it? Whom do you admire, if you\ndo not admire the Emperor? And what more do you want? If you will have\nnone of that great man, what great men would you like? He had\neverything. He was complete. He had in his brain the sum of human\nfaculties. He made codes like Justinian, he dictated like Cæsar, his\nconversation was mingled with the lightning-flash of Pascal, with the\nthunderclap of Tacitus, he made history and he wrote it, his bulletins\nare Iliads, he combined the cipher of Newton with the metaphor of\nMahomet, he left behind him in the East words as great as the pyramids,\nat Tilsit he taught Emperors majesty, at the Academy of Sciences he\nreplied to Laplace, in the Council of State he held his own against\nMerlin, he gave a soul to the geometry of the first, and to the\nchicanery of the last, he was a legist with the attorneys and sidereal\nwith the astronomers; like Cromwell blowing out one of two candles, he\nwent to the Temple to bargain for a curtain tassel; he saw everything;\nhe knew everything; which did not prevent him from laughing\ngood-naturedly beside the cradle of his little child; and all at once,\nfrightened Europe lent an ear, armies put themselves in motion, parks\nof artillery rumbled, pontoons stretched over the rivers, clouds of\ncavalry galloped in the storm, cries, trumpets, a trembling of thrones\nin every direction, the frontiers of kingdoms oscillated on the map,\nthe sound of a superhuman sword was heard, as it was drawn from its\nsheath; they beheld him, him, rise erect on the horizon with a blazing\nbrand in his hand, and a glow in his eyes, unfolding amid the thunder,\nhis two wings, the grand army and the old guard, and he was the\narchangel of war!”\n\n\nAll held their peace, and Enjolras bowed his head. Silence always\nproduces somewhat the effect of acquiescence, of the enemy being driven\nto the wall. Marius continued with increased enthusiasm, and almost\nwithout pausing for breath:—\n\n“Let us be just, my friends! What a splendid destiny for a nation to be\nthe Empire of such an Emperor, when that nation is France and when it\nadds its own genius to the genius of that man! To appear and to reign,\nto march and to triumph, to have for halting-places all capitals, to\ntake his grenadiers and to make kings of them, to decree the falls of\ndynasties, and to transfigure Europe at the pace of a charge; to make\nyou feel that when you threaten you lay your hand on the hilt of the\nsword of God; to follow in a single man, Hannibal, Cæsar, Charlemagne;\nto be the people of some one who mingles with your dawns the startling\nannouncement of a battle won, to have the cannon of the Invalides to\nrouse you in the morning, to hurl into abysses of light prodigious\nwords which flame forever, Marengo, Arcola, Austerlitz, Jena, Wagram!\nTo cause constellations of victories to flash forth at each instant\nfrom the zenith of the centuries, to make the French Empire a pendant\nto the Roman Empire, to be the great nation and to give birth to the\ngrand army, to make its legions fly forth over all the earth, as a\nmountain sends out its eagles on all sides to conquer, to dominate, to\nstrike with lightning, to be in Europe a sort of nation gilded through\nglory, to sound athwart the centuries a trumpet-blast of Titans, to\nconquer the world twice, by conquest and by dazzling, that is sublime;\nand what greater thing is there?”\n\n\n“To be free,” said Combeferre.\n\nMarius lowered his head in his turn; that cold and simple word had\ntraversed his epic effusion like a blade of steel, and he felt it\nvanishing within him. When he raised his eyes, Combeferre was no longer\nthere. Probably satisfied with his reply to the apotheosis, he had just\ntaken his departure, and all, with the exception of Enjolras, had\nfollowed him. The room had been emptied. Enjolras, left alone with\nMarius, was gazing gravely at him. Marius, however, having rallied his\nideas to some extent, did not consider himself beaten; there lingered\nin him a trace of inward fermentation which was on the point, no doubt,\nof translating itself into syllogisms arrayed against Enjolras, when\nall of a sudden, they heard some one singing on the stairs as he went.\nIt was Combeferre, and this is what he was singing:—\n\n“Si César m’avait donné\nLa gloire et la guerre,\nEt qu’il me fallait quitter\nL’amour de ma mère,\nJe dirais au grand César:\nReprends ton sceptre et ton char,\nJ’aime mieux ma mère, ô gué!\nJ’aime mieux ma mère!”25\n\n\nThe wild and tender accents with which Combeferre sang communicated to\nthis couplet a sort of strange grandeur. Marius, thoughtfully, and with\nhis eyes diked on the ceiling, repeated almost mechanically: “My\nmother?—”\n\n\nAt that moment, he felt Enjolras’ hand on his shoulder.\n\n“Citizen,” said Enjolras to him, “my mother is the Republic.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—RES ANGUSTA\n\n\nThat evening left Marius profoundly shaken, and with a melancholy\nshadow in his soul. He felt what the earth may possibly feel, at the\nmoment when it is torn open with the iron, in order that grain may be\ndeposited within it; it feels only the wound; the quiver of the germ\nand the joy of the fruit only arrive later.\n\nMarius was gloomy. He had but just acquired a faith; must he then\nreject it already? He affirmed to himself that he would not. He\ndeclared to himself that he would not doubt, and he began to doubt in\nspite of himself. To stand between two religions, from one of which you\nhave not as yet emerged, and another into which you have not yet\nentered, is intolerable; and twilight is pleasing only to bat-like\nsouls. Marius was clear-eyed, and he required the true light. The\nhalf-lights of doubt pained him. Whatever may have been his desire to\nremain where he was, he could not halt there, he was irresistibly\nconstrained to continue, to advance, to examine, to think, to march\nfurther. Whither would this lead him? He feared, after having taken so\nmany steps which had brought him nearer to his father, to now take a\nstep which should estrange him from that father. His discomfort was\naugmented by all the reflections which occurred to him. An escarpment\nrose around him. He was in accord neither with his grandfather nor with\nhis friends; daring in the eyes of the one, he was behind the times in\nthe eyes of the others, and he recognized the fact that he was doubly\nisolated, on the side of age and on the side of youth. He ceased to go\nto the Café Musain.\n\nIn the troubled state of his conscience, he no longer thought of\ncertain serious sides of existence. The realities of life do not allow\nthemselves to be forgotten. They soon elbowed him abruptly.\n\nOne morning, the proprietor of the hotel entered Marius’ room and said\nto him:—\n\n“Monsieur Courfeyrac answered for you.”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“But I must have my money.”\n\n\n“Request Courfeyrac to come and talk with me,” said Marius.\n\nCourfeyrac having made his appearance, the host left them. Marius then\ntold him what it had not before occurred to him to relate, that he was\nthe same as alone in the world, and had no relatives.\n\n“What is to become of you?” said Courfeyrac.\n\n“I do not know in the least,” replied Marius.\n\n“What are you going to do?”\n\n\n“I do not know.”\n\n\n“Have you any money?”\n\n\n“Fifteen francs.”\n\n\n“Do you want me to lend you some?”\n\n\n“Never.”\n\n\n“Have you clothes?”\n\n\n“Here is what I have.”\n\n\n“Have you trinkets?”\n\n\n“A watch.”\n\n\n“Silver?”\n\n\n“Gold; here it is.”\n\n\n“I know a clothes-dealer who will take your frock-coat and a pair of\ntrousers.”\n\n\n“That is good.”\n\n\n“You will then have only a pair of trousers, a waistcoat, a hat and a\ncoat.”\n\n\n“And my boots.”\n\n\n“What! you will not go barefoot? What opulence!”\n\n\n“That will be enough.”\n\n\n“I know a watchmaker who will buy your watch.”\n\n\n“That is good.”\n\n\n“No; it is not good. What will you do after that?”\n\n\n“Whatever is necessary. Anything honest, that is to say.”\n\n\n“Do you know English?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“Do you know German?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“So much the worse.”\n\n\n“Why?”\n\n\n“Because one of my friends, a publisher, is getting up a sort of an\nencyclopædia, for which you might have translated English or German\narticles. It is badly paid work, but one can live by it.”\n\n\n“I will learn English and German.”\n\n\n“And in the meanwhile?”\n\n\n“In the meanwhile I will live on my clothes and my watch.”\n\n\nThe clothes-dealer was sent for. He paid twenty francs for the cast-off\ngarments. They went to the watchmaker’s. He bought the watch for\nforty-five francs.\n\n“That is not bad,” said Marius to Courfeyrac, on their return to the\nhotel, “with my fifteen francs, that makes eighty.”\n\n\n“And the hotel bill?” observed Courfeyrac.\n\n“Hello, I had forgotten that,” said Marius.\n\nThe landlord presented his bill, which had to be paid on the spot. It\namounted to seventy francs.\n\n“I have ten francs left,” said Marius.\n\n“The deuce,” exclaimed Courfeyrac, “you will eat up five francs while\nyou are learning English, and five while learning German. That will be\nswallowing a tongue very fast, or a hundred sous very slowly.”\n\n\nIn the meantime Aunt Gillenormand, a rather good-hearted person at\nbottom in difficulties, had finally hunted up Marius’ abode.\n\nOne morning, on his return from the law-school, Marius found a letter\nfrom his aunt, and the _sixty pistoles_, that is to say, six hundred\nfrancs in gold, in a sealed box.\n\nMarius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt, with a respectful\nletter, in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence\nand that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs. At that\nmoment, he had three francs left.\n\nHis aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of\nexasperating him. Besides, had he not said: “Let me never hear the name\nof that blood-drinker again!”\n\n\nMarius left the hotel de la Porte Saint-Jacques, as he did not wish to\nrun in debt there.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTH—THE EXCELLENCE OF MISFORTUNE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—MARIUS INDIGENT\n\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nExcellence of Misfortune  3b5-1-misfortune\n\n\nLife became hard for Marius. It was nothing to eat his clothes and his\nwatch. He ate of that terrible, inexpressible thing that is called _de\nla vache enragé_; that is to say, he endured great hardships and\nprivations. A terrible thing it is, containing days without bread,\nnights without sleep, evenings without a candle, a hearth without a\nfire, weeks without work, a future without hope, a coat out at the\nelbows, an old hat which evokes the laughter of young girls, a door\nwhich one finds locked on one at night because one’s rent is not paid,\nthe insolence of the porter and the cook-shop man, the sneers of\nneighbors, humiliations, dignity trampled on, work of whatever nature\naccepted, disgusts, bitterness, despondency. Marius learned how all\nthis is eaten, and how such are often the only things which one has to\ndevour. At that moment of his existence when a man needs his pride,\nbecause he needs love, he felt that he was jeered at because he was\nbadly dressed, and ridiculous because he was poor. At the age when\nyouth swells the heart with imperial pride, he dropped his eyes more\nthan once on his dilapidated boots, and he knew the unjust shame and\nthe poignant blushes of wretchedness. Admirable and terrible trial from\nwhich the feeble emerge base, from which the strong emerge sublime. A\ncrucible into which destiny casts a man, whenever it desires a\nscoundrel or a demi-god.\n\nFor many great deeds are performed in petty combats. There are\ninstances of bravery ignored and obstinate, which defend themselves\nstep by step in that fatal onslaught of necessities and turpitudes.\nNoble and mysterious triumphs which no eye beholds, which are requited\nwith no renown, which are saluted with no trumpet blast. Life,\nmisfortune, isolation, abandonment, poverty, are the fields of battle\nwhich have their heroes; obscure heroes, who are, sometimes, grander\nthan the heroes who win renown.\n\nFirm and rare natures are thus created; misery, almost always a\nstep-mother, is sometimes a mother; destitution gives birth to might of\nsoul and spirit; distress is the nurse of pride; unhappiness is a good\nmilk for the magnanimous.\n\nThere came a moment in Marius’ life, when he swept his own landing,\nwhen he bought his sou’s worth of Brie cheese at the fruiterer’s, when\nhe waited until twilight had fallen to slip into the baker’s and\npurchase a loaf, which he carried off furtively to his attic as though\nhe had stolen it. Sometimes there could be seen gliding into the\nbutcher’s shop on the corner, in the midst of the bantering cooks who\nelbowed him, an awkward young man, carrying big books under his arm,\nwho had a timid yet angry air, who, on entering, removed his hat from a\nbrow whereon stood drops of perspiration, made a profound bow to the\nbutcher’s astonished wife, asked for a mutton cutlet, paid six or seven\nsous for it, wrapped it up in a paper, put it under his arm, between\ntwo books, and went away. It was Marius. On this cutlet, which he\ncooked for himself, he lived for three days.\n\nOn the first day he ate the meat, on the second he ate the fat, on the\nthird he gnawed the bone. Aunt Gillenormand made repeated attempts, and\nsent him the sixty pistoles several times. Marius returned them on\nevery occasion, saying that he needed nothing.\n\nHe was still in mourning for his father when the revolution which we\nhave just described was effected within him. From that time forth, he\nhad not put off his black garments. But his garments were quitting him.\nThe day came when he had no longer a coat. The trousers would go next.\nWhat was to be done? Courfeyrac, to whom he had, on his side, done some\ngood turns, gave him an old coat. For thirty sous, Marius got it turned\nby some porter or other, and it was a new coat. But this coat was\ngreen. Then Marius ceased to go out until after nightfall. This made\nhis coat black. As he wished always to appear in mourning, he clothed\nhimself with the night.\n\nIn spite of all this, he got admitted to practice as a lawyer. He was\nsupposed to live in Courfeyrac’s room, which was decent, and where a\ncertain number of law-books backed up and completed by several\ndilapidated volumes of romance, passed as the library required by the\nregulations. He had his letters addressed to Courfeyrac’s quarters.\n\nWhen Marius became a lawyer, he informed his grandfather of the fact in\na letter which was cold but full of submission and respect. M.\nGillenormand trembled as he took the letter, read it, tore it in four\npieces, and threw it into the waste-basket. Two or three days later,\nMademoiselle Gillenormand heard her father, who was alone in his room,\ntalking aloud to himself. He always did this whenever he was greatly\nagitated. She listened, and the old man was saying: “If you were not a\nfool, you would know that one cannot be a baron and a lawyer at the\nsame time.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—MARIUS POOR\n\n\nIt is the same with wretchedness as with everything else. It ends by\nbecoming bearable. It finally assumes a form, and adjusts itself. One\nvegetates, that is to say, one develops in a certain meagre fashion,\nwhich is, however, sufficient for life. This is the mode in which the\nexistence of Marius Pontmercy was arranged:\n\nHe had passed the worst straits; the narrow pass was opening out a\nlittle in front of him. By dint of toil, perseverance, courage, and\nwill, he had managed to draw from his work about seven hundred francs a\nyear. He had learned German and English; thanks to Courfeyrac, who had\nput him in communication with his friend the publisher, Marius filled\nthe modest post of utility man in the literature of the publishing\nhouse. He drew up prospectuses, translated newspapers, annotated\neditions, compiled biographies, etc.; net product, year in and year\nout, seven hundred francs. He lived on it. How? Not so badly. We will\nexplain.\n\nMarius occupied in the Gorbeau house, for an annual sum of thirty\nfrancs, a den minus a fireplace, called a cabinet, which contained only\nthe most indispensable articles of furniture. This furniture belonged\nto him. He gave three francs a month to the old _principal tenant_ to\ncome and sweep his hole, and to bring him a little hot water every\nmorning, a fresh egg, and a penny roll. He breakfasted on this egg and\nroll. His breakfast varied in cost from two to four sous, according as\neggs were dear or cheap. At six o’clock in the evening he descended the\nRue Saint-Jacques to dine at Rousseau’s, opposite Basset’s, the\nstamp-dealer’s, on the corner of the Rue des Mathurins. He ate no soup.\nHe took a six-sou plate of meat, a half-portion of vegetables for three\nsous, and a three-sou dessert. For three sous he got as much bread as\nhe wished. As for wine, he drank water. When he paid at the desk where\nMadam Rousseau, at that period still plump and rosy majestically\npresided, he gave a sou to the waiter, and Madam Rousseau gave him a\nsmile. Then he went away. For sixteen sous he had a smile and a dinner.\n\nThis Restaurant Rousseau, where so few bottles and so many water\ncarafes were emptied, was a calming potion rather than a restaurant. It\nno longer exists. The proprietor had a fine nickname: he was called\n_Rousseau the Aquatic_.\n\nThus, breakfast four sous, dinner sixteen sous; his food cost him\ntwenty sous a day; which made three hundred and sixty-five francs a\nyear. Add the thirty francs for rent, and the thirty-six francs to the\nold woman, plus a few trifling expenses; for four hundred and fifty\nfrancs, Marius was fed, lodged, and waited on. His clothing cost him a\nhundred francs, his linen fifty francs, his washing fifty francs; the\nwhole did not exceed six hundred and fifty francs. He was rich. He\nsometimes lent ten francs to a friend. Courfeyrac had once been able to\nborrow sixty francs of him. As far as fire was concerned, as Marius had\nno fireplace, he had “simplified matters.”\n\n\nMarius always had two complete suits of clothes, the one old, “for\nevery day”; the other, brand new for special occasions. Both were\nblack. He had but three shirts, one on his person, the second in the\ncommode, and the third in the washerwoman’s hands. He renewed them as\nthey wore out. They were always ragged, which caused him to button his\ncoat to the chin.\n\nIt had required years for Marius to attain to this flourishing\ncondition. Hard years; difficult, some of them, to traverse, others to\nclimb. Marius had not failed for a single day. He had endured\neverything in the way of destitution; he had done everything except\ncontract debts. He did himself the justice to say that he had never\nowed any one a sou. A debt was, to him, the beginning of slavery. He\neven said to himself, that a creditor is worse than a master; for the\nmaster possesses only your person, a creditor possesses your dignity\nand can administer to it a box on the ear. Rather than borrow, he went\nwithout food. He had passed many a day fasting. Feeling that all\nextremes meet, and that, if one is not on one’s guard, lowered fortunes\nmay lead to baseness of soul, he kept a jealous watch on his pride.\nSuch and such a formality or action, which, in any other situation\nwould have appeared merely a deference to him, now seemed insipidity,\nand he nerved himself against it. His face wore a sort of severe flush.\nHe was timid even to rudeness.\n\nDuring all these trials he had felt himself encouraged and even\nuplifted, at times, by a secret force that he possessed within himself.\nThe soul aids the body, and at certain moments, raises it. It is the\nonly bird which bears up its own cage.\n\nBesides his father’s name, another name was graven in Marius’ heart,\nthe name of Thénardier. Marius, with his grave and enthusiastic nature,\nsurrounded with a sort of aureole the man to whom, in his thoughts, he\nowed his father’s life,—that intrepid sergeant who had saved the\ncolonel amid the bullets and the cannon-balls of Waterloo. He never\nseparated the memory of this man from the memory of his father, and he\nassociated them in his veneration. It was a sort of worship in two\nsteps, with the grand altar for the colonel and the lesser one for\nThénardier. What redoubled the tenderness of his gratitude towards\nThénardier, was the idea of the distress into which he knew that\nThénardier had fallen, and which had engulfed the latter. Marius had\nlearned at Montfermeil of the ruin and bankruptcy of the unfortunate\ninn-keeper. Since that time, he had made unheard-of efforts to find\ntraces of him and to reach him in that dark abyss of misery in which\nThénardier had disappeared. Marius had beaten the whole country; he had\ngone to Chelles, to Bondy, to Gourney, to Nogent, to Lagny. He had\npersisted for three years, expending in these explorations the little\nmoney which he had laid by. No one had been able to give him any news\nof Thénardier: he was supposed to have gone abroad. His creditors had\nalso sought him, with less love than Marius, but with as much\nassiduity, and had not been able to lay their hands on him. Marius\nblamed himself, and was almost angry with himself for his lack of\nsuccess in his researches. It was the only debt left him by the\ncolonel, and Marius made it a matter of honor to pay it. “What,” he\nthought, “when my father lay dying on the field of battle, did\nThénardier contrive to find him amid the smoke and the grape-shot, and\nbear him off on his shoulders, and yet he owed him nothing, and I, who\nowe so much to Thénardier, cannot join him in this shadow where he is\nlying in the pangs of death, and in my turn bring him back from death\nto life! Oh! I will find him!” To find Thénardier, in fact, Marius\nwould have given one of his arms, to rescue him from his misery, he\nwould have sacrificed all his blood. To see Thénardier, to render\nThénardier some service, to say to him: “You do not know me; well, I do\nknow you! Here I am. Dispose of me!” This was Marius’ sweetest and most\nmagnificent dream.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—MARIUS GROWN UP\n\n\nAt this epoch, Marius was twenty years of age. It was three years since\nhe had left his grandfather. Both parties had remained on the same\nterms, without attempting to approach each other, and without seeking\nto see each other. Besides, what was the use of seeing each other?\nMarius was the brass vase, while Father Gillenormand was the iron pot.\n\nWe admit that Marius was mistaken as to his grandfather’s heart. He had\nimagined that M. Gillenormand had never loved him, and that that\ncrusty, harsh, and smiling old fellow who cursed, shouted, and stormed\nand brandished his cane, cherished for him, at the most, only that\naffection, which is at once slight and severe, of the dotards of\ncomedy. Marius was in error. There are fathers who do not love their\nchildren; there exists no grandfather who does not adore his grandson.\nAt bottom, as we have said, M. Gillenormand idolized Marius. He\nidolized him after his own fashion, with an accompaniment of\nsnappishness and boxes on the ear; but, this child once gone, he felt a\nblack void in his heart; he would allow no one to mention the child to\nhim, and all the while secretly regretted that he was so well obeyed.\nAt first, he hoped that this Buonapartist, this Jacobin, this\nterrorist, this Septembrist, would return. But the weeks passed by,\nyears passed; to M. Gillenormand’s great despair, the “blood-drinker”\ndid not make his appearance. “I could not do otherwise than turn him\nout,” said the grandfather to himself, and he asked himself: “If the\nthing were to do over again, would I do it?” His pride instantly\nanswered “yes,” but his aged head, which he shook in silence, replied\nsadly “no.” He had his hours of depression. He missed Marius. Old men\nneed affection as they need the sun. It is warmth. Strong as his nature\nwas, the absence of Marius had wrought some change in him. Nothing in\nthe world could have induced him to take a step towards “that rogue”;\nbut he suffered. He never inquired about him, but he thought of him\nincessantly. He lived in the Marais in a more and more retired manner;\nhe was still merry and violent as of old, but his merriment had a\nconvulsive harshness, and his violences always terminated in a sort of\ngentle and gloomy dejection. He sometimes said: “Oh! if he only would\nreturn, what a good box on the ear I would give him!”\n\n\nAs for his aunt, she thought too little to love much; Marius was no\nlonger for her much more than a vague black form; and she eventually\ncame to occupy herself with him much less than with the cat or the\nparoquet which she probably had. What augmented Father Gillenormand’s\nsecret suffering was, that he locked it all up within his breast, and\ndid not allow its existence to be divined. His sorrow was like those\nrecently invented furnaces which consume their own smoke. It sometimes\nhappened that officious busybodies spoke to him of Marius, and asked\nhim: “What is your grandson doing?” “What has become of him?” The old\nbourgeois replied with a sigh, that he was a sad case, and giving a\nfillip to his cuff, if he wished to appear gay: “Monsieur le Baron de\nPontmercy is practising pettifogging in some corner or other.”\n\n\nWhile the old man regretted, Marius applauded himself. As is the case\nwith all good-hearted people, misfortune had eradicated his bitterness.\nHe only thought of M. Gillenormand in an amiable light, but he had set\nhis mind on not receiving anything more from the man who _had been\nunkind to his father_. This was the mitigated translation of his first\nindignation. Moreover, he was happy at having suffered, and at\nsuffering still. It was for his father’s sake. The hardness of his life\nsatisfied and pleased him. He said to himself with a sort of joy that—\n_it was certainly the least he could do_; that it was an\nexpiation;—that, had it not been for that, he would have been punished\nin some other way and later on for his impious indifference towards his\nfather, and such a father! that it would not have been just that his\nfather should have all the suffering, and he none of it; and that, in\nany case, what were his toils and his destitution compared with the\ncolonel’s heroic life? that, in short, the only way for him to approach\nhis father and resemble him, was to be brave in the face of indigence,\nas the other had been valiant before the enemy; and that that was, no\ndoubt, what the colonel had meant to imply by the words: “He will be\nworthy of it.” Words which Marius continued to wear, not on his breast,\nsince the colonel’s writing had disappeared, but in his heart.\n\nAnd then, on the day when his grandfather had turned him out of doors,\nhe had been only a child, now he was a man. He felt it. Misery, we\nrepeat, had been good for him. Poverty in youth, when it succeeds, has\nthis magnificent property about it, that it turns the whole will\ntowards effort, and the whole soul towards aspiration. Poverty\ninstantly lays material life bare and renders it hideous; hence\ninexpressible bounds towards the ideal life. The wealthy young man has\na hundred coarse and brilliant distractions, horse races, hunting,\ndogs, tobacco, gaming, good repasts, and all the rest of it;\noccupations for the baser side of the soul, at the expense of the\nloftier and more delicate sides. The poor young man wins his bread with\ndifficulty; he eats; when he has eaten, he has nothing more but\nmeditation. He goes to the spectacles which God furnishes gratis; he\ngazes at the sky, space, the stars, flowers, children, the humanity\namong which he is suffering, the creation amid which he beams. He gazes\nso much on humanity that he perceives its soul, he gazes upon creation\nto such an extent that he beholds God. He dreams, he feels himself\ngreat; he dreams on, and feels himself tender. From the egotism of the\nman who suffers he passes to the compassion of the man who meditates.\nAn admirable sentiment breaks forth in him, forgetfulness of self and\npity for all. As he thinks of the innumerable enjoyments which nature\noffers, gives, and lavishes to souls which stand open, and refuses to\nsouls that are closed, he comes to pity, he the millionnaire of the\nmind, the millionnaire of money. All hatred departs from his heart, in\nproportion as light penetrates his spirit. And is he unhappy? No. The\nmisery of a young man is never miserable. The first young lad who comes\nto hand, however poor he may be, with his strength, his health, his\nrapid walk, his brilliant eyes, his warmly circulating blood, his black\nhair, his red lips, his white teeth, his pure breath, will always\narouse the envy of an aged emperor. And then, every morning, he sets\nhimself afresh to the task of earning his bread; and while his hands\nearn his bread, his dorsal column gains pride, his brain gathers ideas.\nHis task finished, he returns to ineffable ecstasies, to contemplation,\nto joys; he beholds his feet set in afflictions, in obstacles, on the\npavement, in the nettles, sometimes in the mire; his head in the light.\nHe is firm, serene, gentle, peaceful, attentive, serious, content with\nlittle, kindly; and he thanks God for having bestowed on him those two\nforms of riches which many a rich man lacks: work, which makes him\nfree; and thought, which makes him dignified.\n\nThis is what had happened with Marius. To tell the truth, he inclined a\nlittle too much to the side of contemplation. From the day when he had\nsucceeded in earning his living with some approach to certainty, he had\nstopped, thinking it good to be poor, and retrenching time from his\nwork to give to thought; that is to say, he sometimes passed entire\ndays in meditation, absorbed, engulfed, like a visionary, in the mute\nvoluptuousness of ecstasy and inward radiance. He had thus propounded\nthe problem of his life: to toil as little as possible at material\nlabor, in order to toil as much as possible at the labor which is\nimpalpable; in other words, to bestow a few hours on real life, and to\ncast the rest to the infinite. As he believed that he lacked nothing,\nhe did not perceive that contemplation, thus understood, ends by\nbecoming one of the forms of idleness; that he was contenting himself\nwith conquering the first necessities of life, and that he was resting\nfrom his labors too soon.\n\nIt was evident that, for this energetic and enthusiastic nature, this\ncould only be a transitory state, and that, at the first shock against\nthe inevitable complications of destiny, Marius would awaken.\n\nIn the meantime, although he was a lawyer, and whatever Father\nGillenormand thought about the matter, he was not practising, he was\nnot even pettifogging. Meditation had turned him aside from pleading.\nTo haunt attorneys, to follow the court, to hunt up cases—what a bore!\nWhy should he do it? He saw no reason for changing the manner of\ngaining his livelihood! The obscure and ill-paid publishing\nestablishment had come to mean for him a sure source of work which did\nnot involve too much labor, as we have explained, and which sufficed\nfor his wants.\n\nOne of the publishers for whom he worked, M. Magimel, I think, offered\nto take him into his own house, to lodge him well, to furnish him with\nregular occupation, and to give him fifteen hundred francs a year. To\nbe well lodged! Fifteen hundred francs! No doubt. But renounce his\nliberty! Be on fixed wages! A sort of hired man of letters! According\nto Marius’ opinion, if he accepted, his position would become both\nbetter and worse at the same time, he acquired comfort, and lost his\ndignity; it was a fine and complete unhappiness converted into a\nrepulsive and ridiculous state of torture: something like the case of a\nblind man who should recover the sight of one eye. He refused.\n\nMarius dwelt in solitude. Owing to his taste for remaining outside of\neverything, and through having been too much alarmed, he had not\nentered decidedly into the group presided over by Enjolras. They had\nremained good friends; they were ready to assist each other on occasion\nin every possible way; but nothing more. Marius had two friends: one\nyoung, Courfeyrac; and one old, M. Mabeuf. He inclined more to the old\nman. In the first place, he owed to him the revolution which had taken\nplace within him; to him he was indebted for having known and loved his\nfather. “He operated on me for a cataract,” he said.\n\nThe churchwarden had certainly played a decisive part.\n\nIt was not, however, that M. Mabeuf had been anything but the calm and\nimpassive agent of Providence in this connection. He had enlightened\nMarius by chance and without being aware of the fact, as does a candle\nwhich some one brings; he had been the candle and not the some one.\n\nAs for Marius’ inward political revolution, M. Mabeuf was totally\nincapable of comprehending it, of willing or of directing it.\n\nAs we shall see M. Mabeuf again, later on, a few words will not be\nsuperfluous.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—M. MABEUF\n\n\nOn the day when M. Mabeuf said to Marius: “Certainly I approve of\npolitical opinions,” he expressed the real state of his mind. All\npolitical opinions were matters of indifference to him, and he approved\nthem all, without distinction, provided they left him in peace, as the\nGreeks called the Furies “the beautiful, the good, the charming,” the\nEumenides. M. Mabeuf’s political opinion consisted in a passionate love\nfor plants, and, above all, for books. Like all the rest of the world,\nhe possessed the termination in _ist_, without which no one could exist\nat that time, but he was neither a Royalist, a Bonapartist, a Chartist,\nan Orleanist, nor an Anarchist; he was a _bouquinist_, a collector of\nold books. He did not understand how men could busy themselves with\nhating each other because of silly stuff like the charter, democracy,\nlegitimacy, monarchy, the republic, etc., when there were in the world\nall sorts of mosses, grasses, and shrubs which they might be looking\nat, and heaps of folios, and even of 32mos, which they might turn over.\nHe took good care not to become useless; having books did not prevent\nhis reading, being a botanist did not prevent his being a gardener.\nWhen he made Pontmercy’s acquaintance, this sympathy had existed\nbetween the colonel and himself—that what the colonel did for flowers,\nhe did for fruits. M. Mabeuf had succeeded in producing seedling pears\nas savory as the pears of St. Germain; it is from one of his\ncombinations, apparently, that the October Mirabelle, now celebrated\nand no less perfumed than the summer Mirabelle, owes its origin. He\nwent to mass rather from gentleness than from piety, and because, as he\nloved the faces of men, but hated their noise, he found them assembled\nand silent only in church. Feeling that he must be something in the\nState, he had chosen the career of warden. However, he had never\nsucceeded in loving any woman as much as a tulip bulb, nor any man as\nmuch as an Elzevir. He had long passed sixty, when, one day, some one\nasked him: “Have you never been married?” “I have forgotten,” said he.\nWhen it sometimes happened to him—and to whom does it not happen?—to\nsay: “Oh! if I were only rich!” it was not when ogling a pretty girl,\nas was the case with Father Gillenormand, but when contemplating an old\nbook. He lived alone with an old housekeeper. He was somewhat gouty,\nand when he was asleep, his aged fingers, stiffened with rheumatism,\nlay crooked up in the folds of his sheets. He had composed and\npublished a _Flora of the Environs of Cauteretz_, with colored plates,\na work which enjoyed a tolerable measure of esteem and which sold well.\nPeople rang his bell, in the Rue Mésières, two or three times a day, to\nask for it. He drew as much as two thousand francs a year from it; this\nconstituted nearly the whole of his fortune. Although poor, he had had\nthe talent to form for himself, by dint of patience, privations, and\ntime, a precious collection of rare copies of every sort. He never went\nout without a book under his arm, and he often returned with two. The\nsole decoration of the four rooms on the ground floor, which composed\nhis lodgings, consisted of framed herbariums, and engravings of the old\nmasters. The sight of a sword or a gun chilled his blood. He had never\napproached a cannon in his life, even at the Invalides. He had a\npassable stomach, a brother who was a curé, perfectly white hair, no\nteeth, either in his mouth or his mind, a trembling in every limb, a\nPicard accent, an infantile laugh, the air of an old sheep, and he was\neasily frightened. Add to this, that he had no other friendship, no\nother acquaintance among the living, than an old bookseller of the\nPorte-Saint-Jacques, named Royal. His dream was to naturalize indigo in\nFrance.\n\nHis servant was also a sort of innocent. The poor good old woman was a\nspinster. Sultan, her cat, which might have mewed Allegri’s miserere in\nthe Sixtine Chapel, had filled her heart and sufficed for the quantity\nof passion which existed in her. None of her dreams had ever proceeded\nas far as man. She had never been able to get further than her cat.\nLike him, she had a moustache. Her glory consisted in her caps, which\nwere always white. She passed her time, on Sundays, after mass, in\ncounting over the linen in her chest, and in spreading out on her bed\nthe dresses in the piece which she bought and never had made up. She\nknew how to read. M. Mabeuf had nicknamed her Mother Plutarque.\n\nM. Mabeuf had taken a fancy to Marius, because Marius, being young and\ngentle, warmed his age without startling his timidity. Youth combined\nwith gentleness produces on old people the effect of the sun without\nwind. When Marius was saturated with military glory, with gunpowder,\nwith marches and countermarches, and with all those prodigious battles\nin which his father had given and received such tremendous blows of the\nsword, he went to see M. Mabeuf, and M. Mabeuf talked to him of his\nhero from the point of view of flowers.\n\nHis brother the curé died about 1830, and almost immediately, as when\nthe night is drawing on, the whole horizon grew dark for M. Mabeuf. A\nnotary’s failure deprived him of the sum of ten thousand francs, which\nwas all that he possessed in his brother’s right and his own. The\nRevolution of July brought a crisis to publishing. In a period of\nembarrassment, the first thing which does not sell is a _Flora. The\nFlora of the Environs of Cauteretz_ stopped short. Weeks passed by\nwithout a single purchaser. Sometimes M. Mabeuf started at the sound of\nthe bell. “Monsieur,” said Mother Plutarque sadly, “it is the\nwater-carrier.” In short, one day, M. Mabeuf quitted the Rue Mésières,\nabdicated the functions of warden, gave up Saint-Sulpice, sold not a\npart of his books, but of his prints,—that to which he was the least\nattached,—and installed himself in a little house on the Rue\nMontparnasse, where, however, he remained but one quarter for two\nreasons: in the first place, the ground floor and the garden cost three\nhundred francs, and he dared not spend more than two hundred francs on\nhis rent; in the second, being near Faton’s shooting-gallery, he could\nhear the pistol-shots; which was intolerable to him.\n\nHe carried off his _Flora_, his copper-plates, his herbariums, his\nportfolios, and his books, and established himself near the\nSalpêtrière, in a sort of thatched cottage of the village of\nAusterlitz, where, for fifty crowns a year, he got three rooms and a\ngarden enclosed by a hedge, and containing a well. He took advantage of\nthis removal to sell off nearly all his furniture. On the day of his\nentrance into his new quarters, he was very gay, and drove the nails on\nwhich his engravings and herbariums were to hang, with his own hands,\ndug in his garden the rest of the day, and at night, perceiving that\nMother Plutarque had a melancholy air, and was very thoughtful, he\ntapped her on the shoulder and said to her with a smile: “We have the\nindigo!”\n\n\nOnly two visitors, the bookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques and\nMarius, were admitted to view the thatched cottage at Austerlitz, a\nbrawling name which was, to tell the truth, extremely disagreeable to\nhim.\n\nHowever, as we have just pointed out, brains which are absorbed in some\nbit of wisdom, or folly, or, as it often happens, in both at once, are\nbut slowly accessible to the things of actual life. Their own destiny\nis a far-off thing to them. There results from such concentration a\npassivity, which, if it were the outcome of reasoning, would resemble\nphilosophy. One declines, descends, trickles away, even crumbles away,\nand yet is hardly conscious of it one’s self. It always ends, it is\ntrue, in an awakening, but the awakening is tardy. In the meantime, it\nseems as though we held ourselves neutral in the game which is going on\nbetween our happiness and our unhappiness. We are the stake, and we\nlook on at the game with indifference.\n\nIt is thus that, athwart the cloud which formed about him, when all his\nhopes were extinguished one after the other, M. Mabeuf remained rather\npuerilely, but profoundly serene. His habits of mind had the regular\nswing of a pendulum. Once mounted on an illusion, he went for a very\nlong time, even after the illusion had disappeared. A clock does not\nstop short at the precise moment when the key is lost.\n\nM. Mabeuf had his innocent pleasures. These pleasures were inexpensive\nand unexpected; the merest chance furnished them. One day, Mother\nPlutarque was reading a romance in one corner of the room. She was\nreading aloud, finding that she understood better thus. To read aloud\nis to assure one’s self of what one is reading. There are people who\nread very loud, and who have the appearance of giving themselves their\nword of honor as to what they are perusing.\n\nIt was with this sort of energy that Mother Plutarque was reading the\nromance which she had in hand. M. Mabeuf heard her without listening to\nher.\n\nIn the course of her reading, Mother Plutarque came to this phrase. It\nwas a question of an officer of dragoons and a beauty:—\n\n“—The beauty pouted, and the dragoon—”\n\n\nHere she interrupted herself to wipe her glasses.\n\n“Bouddha and the Dragon,” struck in M. Mabeuf in a low voice. “Yes, it\nis true that there was a dragon, which, from the depths of its cave,\nspouted flame through his maw and set the heavens on fire. Many stars\nhad already been consumed by this monster, which, besides, had the\nclaws of a tiger. Bouddha went into its den and succeeded in converting\nthe dragon. That is a good book that you are reading, Mother Plutarque.\nThere is no more beautiful legend in existence.”\n\n\nAnd M. Mabeuf fell into a delicious reverie.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—POVERTY A GOOD NEIGHBOR FOR MISERY\n\n\nMarius liked this candid old man who saw himself gradually falling into\nthe clutches of indigence, and who came to feel astonishment, little by\nlittle, without, however, being made melancholy by it. Marius met\nCourfeyrac and sought out M. Mabeuf. Very rarely, however; twice a\nmonth at most.\n\nMarius’ pleasure consisted in taking long walks alone on the outer\nboulevards, or in the Champs-de-Mars, or in the least frequented alleys\nof the Luxembourg. He often spent half a day in gazing at a market\ngarden, the beds of lettuce, the chickens on the dung-heap, the horse\nturning the water-wheel. The passers-by stared at him in surprise, and\nsome of them thought his attire suspicious and his mien sinister. He\nwas only a poor young man dreaming in an objectless way.\n\nIt was during one of his strolls that he had hit upon the Gorbeau\nhouse, and, tempted by its isolation and its cheapness, had taken up\nhis abode there. He was known there only under the name of M. Marius.\n\nSome of his father’s old generals or old comrades had invited him to go\nand see them, when they learned about him. Marius had not refused their\ninvitations. They afforded opportunities of talking about his father.\nThus he went from time to time, to Comte Pajol, to General Bellavesne,\nto General Fririon, to the Invalides. There was music and dancing\nthere. On such evenings, Marius put on his new coat. But he never went\nto these evening parties or balls except on days when it was freezing\ncold, because he could not afford a carriage, and he did not wish to\narrive with boots otherwise than like mirrors.\n\nHe said sometimes, but without bitterness: “Men are so made that in a\ndrawing-room you may be soiled everywhere except on your shoes. In\norder to insure a good reception there, only one irreproachable thing\nis asked of you; your conscience? No, your boots.”\n\n\nAll passions except those of the heart are dissipated by reverie.\nMarius’ political fevers vanished thus. The Revolution of 1830 assisted\nin the process, by satisfying and calming him. He remained the same,\nsetting aside his fits of wrath. He still held the same opinions. Only,\nthey had been tempered. To speak accurately, he had no longer any\nopinions, he had sympathies. To what party did he belong? To the party\nof humanity. Out of humanity he chose France; out of the Nation he\nchose the people; out of the people he chose the woman. It was to that\npoint above all, that his pity was directed. Now he preferred an idea\nto a deed, a poet to a hero, and he admired a book like Job more than\nan event like Marengo. And then, when, after a day spent in meditation,\nhe returned in the evening through the boulevards, and caught a glimpse\nthrough the branches of the trees of the fathomless space beyond, the\nnameless gleams, the abyss, the shadow, the mystery, all that which is\nonly human seemed very pretty indeed to him.\n\nHe thought that he had, and he really had, in fact, arrived at the\ntruth of life and of human philosophy, and he had ended by gazing at\nnothing but heaven, the only thing which Truth can perceive from the\nbottom of her well.\n\nThis did not prevent him from multiplying his plans, his combinations,\nhis scaffoldings, his projects for the future. In this state of\nreverie, an eye which could have cast a glance into Marius’ interior\nwould have been dazzled with the purity of that soul. In fact, had it\nbeen given to our eyes of the flesh to gaze into the consciences of\nothers, we should be able to judge a man much more surely according to\nwhat he dreams, than according to what he thinks. There is will in\nthought, there is none in dreams. Reverie, which is utterly\nspontaneous, takes and keeps, even in the gigantic and the ideal, the\nform of our spirit. Nothing proceeds more directly and more sincerely\nfrom the very depth of our soul, than our unpremeditated and boundless\naspirations towards the splendors of destiny. In these aspirations,\nmuch more than in deliberate, rational co-ordinated ideas, is the real\ncharacter of a man to be found. Our chimæras are the things which the\nmost resemble us. Each one of us dreams of the unknown and the\nimpossible in accordance with his nature.\n\nTowards the middle of this year 1831, the old woman who waited on\nMarius told him that his neighbors, the wretched Jondrette family, had\nbeen turned out of doors. Marius, who passed nearly the whole of his\ndays out of the house, hardly knew that he had any neighbors.\n\n“Why are they turned out?” he asked.\n\n“Because they do not pay their rent; they owe for two quarters.”\n\n\n“How much is it?”\n\n\n“Twenty francs,” said the old woman.\n\nMarius had thirty francs saved up in a drawer.\n\n“Here,” he said to the old woman, “take these twenty-five francs. Pay\nfor the poor people and give them five francs, and do not tell them\nthat it was I.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—THE SUBSTITUTE\n\n\nIt chanced that the regiment to which Lieutenant Théodule belonged came\nto perform garrison duty in Paris. This inspired Aunt Gillenormand with\na second idea. She had, on the first occasion, hit upon the plan of\nhaving Marius spied upon by Théodule; now she plotted to have Théodule\ntake Marius’ place.\n\nAt all events and in case the grandfather should feel the vague need of\na young face in the house,—these rays of dawn are sometimes sweet to\nruin,—it was expedient to find another Marius. “Take it as a simple\nerratum,” she thought, “such as one sees in books. For Marius, read\nThéodule.”\n\n\nA grandnephew is almost the same as a grandson; in default of a lawyer\none takes a lancer.\n\nOne morning, when M. Gillenormand was about to read something in the\n_Quotidienne_, his daughter entered and said to him in her sweetest\nvoice; for the question concerned her favorite:—\n\n“Father, Théodule is coming to present his respects to you this\nmorning.”\n\n\n“Who’s Théodule?”\n\n\n“Your grandnephew.”\n\n\n“Ah!” said the grandfather.\n\nThen he went back to his reading, thought no more of his grandnephew,\nwho was merely some Théodule or other, and soon flew into a rage, which\nalmost always happened when he read. The “sheet” which he held,\nalthough Royalist, of course, announced for the following day, without\nany softening phrases, one of these little events which were of daily\noccurrence at that date in Paris: “That the students of the schools of\nlaw and medicine were to assemble on the Place du Panthéon, at\nmidday,—to deliberate.” The discussion concerned one of the questions\nof the moment, the artillery of the National Guard, and a conflict\nbetween the Minister of War and “the citizen’s militia,” on the subject\nof the cannon parked in the courtyard of the Louvre. The students were\nto “deliberate” over this. It did not take much more than this to swell\nM. Gillenormand’s rage.\n\nHe thought of Marius, who was a student, and who would probably go with\nthe rest, to “deliberate, at midday, on the Place du Panthéon.”\n\n\nAs he was indulging in this painful dream, Lieutenant Théodule entered\nclad in plain clothes as a bourgeois, which was clever of him, and was\ndiscreetly introduced by Mademoiselle Gillenormand. The lancer had\nreasoned as follows: “The old druid has not sunk all his money in a\nlife pension. It is well to disguise one’s self as a civilian from time\nto time.”\n\n\nMademoiselle Gillenormand said aloud to her father:—\n\n“Théodule, your grandnephew.”\n\n\nAnd in a low voice to the lieutenant:—\n\n“Approve of everything.”\n\n\nAnd she withdrew.\n\nThe lieutenant, who was but little accustomed to such venerable\nencounters, stammered with some timidity: “Good day, uncle,”—and made a\nsalute composed of the involuntary and mechanical outline of the\nmilitary salute finished off as a bourgeois salute.\n\n“Ah! so it’s you; that is well, sit down,” said the old gentleman.\n\nThat said, he totally forgot the lancer.\n\nThéodule seated himself, and M. Gillenormand rose.\n\nM. Gillenormand began to pace back and forth, his hands in his pockets,\ntalking aloud, and twitching, with his irritated old fingers, at the\ntwo watches which he wore in his two fobs.\n\n“That pack of brats! they convene on the Place du Panthéon! by my life!\nurchins who were with their nurses but yesterday! If one were to\nsqueeze their noses, milk would burst out. And they deliberate\nto-morrow, at midday. What are we coming to? What are we coming to? It\nis clear that we are making for the abyss. That is what the\n_descamisados_ have brought us to! To deliberate on the citizen\nartillery! To go and jabber in the open air over the jibes of the\nNational Guard! And with whom are they to meet there? Just see whither\nJacobinism leads. I will bet anything you like, a million against a\ncounter, that there will be no one there but returned convicts and\nreleased galley-slaves. The Republicans and the galley-slaves,—they\nform but one nose and one handkerchief. Carnot used to say: ‘Where\nwould you have me go, traitor?’ Fouché replied: ‘Wherever you please,\nimbecile!’ That’s what the Republicans are like.”\n\n\n“That is true,” said Théodule.\n\nM. Gillenormand half turned his head, saw Théodule, and went on:—\n\n“When one reflects that that scoundrel was so vile as to turn\ncarbonaro! Why did you leave my house? To go and become a Republican!\nPssst! In the first place, the people want none of your republic, they\nhave common sense, they know well that there always have been kings,\nand that there always will be; they know well that the people are only\nthe people, after all, they make sport of it, of your republic—do you\nunderstand, idiot? Is it not a horrible caprice? To fall in love with\nPère Duchesne, to make sheep’s-eyes at the guillotine, to sing\nromances, and play on the guitar under the balcony of ’93—it’s enough\nto make one spit on all these young fellows, such fools are they! They\nare all alike. Not one escapes. It suffices for them to breathe the air\nwhich blows through the street to lose their senses. The nineteenth\ncentury is poison. The first scamp that happens along lets his beard\ngrow like a goat’s, thinks himself a real scoundrel, and abandons his\nold relatives. He’s a Republican, he’s a romantic. What does that mean,\nromantic? Do me the favor to tell me what it is. All possible follies.\nA year ago, they ran to _Hernani_. Now, I just ask you, _Hernani!_\nantitheses! abominations which are not even written in French! And\nthen, they have cannons in the courtyard of the Louvre. Such are the\nrascalities of this age!”\n\n\n“You are right, uncle,” said Théodule.\n\nM. Gillenormand resumed:—\n\n“Cannons in the courtyard of the Museum! For what purpose? Do you want\nto fire grape-shot at the Apollo Belvedere? What have those cartridges\nto do with the Venus de Medici? Oh! the young men of the present day\nare all blackguards! What a pretty creature is their Benjamin Constant!\nAnd those who are not rascals are simpletons! They do all they can to\nmake themselves ugly, they are badly dressed, they are afraid of women,\nin the presence of petticoats they have a mendicant air which sets the\ngirls into fits of laughter; on my word of honor, one would say the\npoor creatures were ashamed of love. They are deformed, and they\ncomplete themselves by being stupid; they repeat the puns of Tiercelin\nand Potier, they have sack coats, stablemen’s waistcoats, shirts of\ncoarse linen, trousers of coarse cloth, boots of coarse leather, and\ntheir rigmarole resembles their plumage. One might make use of their\njargon to put new soles on their old shoes. And all this awkward batch\nof brats has political opinions, if you please. Political opinions\nshould be strictly forbidden. They fabricate systems, they recast\nsociety, they demolish the monarchy, they fling all laws to the earth,\nthey put the attic in the cellar’s place and my porter in the place of\nthe King, they turn Europe topsy-turvy, they reconstruct the world, and\nall their love affairs consist in staring slily at the ankles of the\nlaundresses as these women climb into their carts. Ah! Marius! Ah! you\nblackguard! to go and vociferate on the public place! to discuss, to\ndebate, to take measures! They call that measures, just God! Disorder\nhumbles itself and becomes silly. I have seen chaos, I now see a mess.\nStudents deliberating on the National Guard,—such a thing could not be\nseen among the Ogibewas nor the Cadodaches! Savages who go naked, with\ntheir noddles dressed like a shuttlecock, with a club in their paws,\nare less of brutes than those bachelors of arts! The four-penny\nmonkeys! And they set up for judges! Those creatures deliberate and\nratiocinate! The end of the world is come! This is plainly the end of\nthis miserable terraqueous globe! A final hiccough was required, and\nFrance has emitted it. Deliberate, my rascals! Such things will happen\nso long as they go and read the newspapers under the arcades of the\nOdéon. That costs them a sou, and their good sense, and their\nintelligence, and their heart and their soul, and their wits. They\nemerge thence, and decamp from their families. All newspapers are\npests; all, even the _Drapeau Blanc!_ At bottom, Martainville was a\nJacobin. Ah! just Heaven! you may boast of having driven your\ngrandfather to despair, that you may!”\n\n\n“That is evident,” said Théodule.\n\nAnd profiting by the fact that M. Gillenormand was taking breath, the\nlancer added in a magisterial manner:—\n\n“There should be no other newspaper than the _Moniteur_, and no other\nbook than the _Annuaire Militaire_.”\n\n\nM. Gillenormand continued:—\n\n“It is like their Sieyès! A regicide ending in a senator; for that is\nthe way they always end. They give themselves a scar with the address\nof _thou_ as citizens, in order to get themselves called, eventually,\n_Monsieur le Comte_. Monsieur le Comte as big as my arm, assassins of\nSeptember. The philosopher Sieyès! I will do myself the justice to say,\nthat I have never had any better opinion of the philosophies of all\nthose philosophers, than of the spectacles of the grimacer of Tivoli!\nOne day I saw the Senators cross the Quai Malplaquet in mantles of\nviolet velvet sown with bees, with hats à la Henri IV. They were\nhideous. One would have pronounced them monkeys from the tiger’s court.\nCitizens, I declare to you, that your progress is madness, that your\nhumanity is a dream, that your revolution is a crime, that your\nrepublic is a monster, that your young and virgin France comes from the\nbrothel, and I maintain it against all, whoever you may be, whether\njournalists, economists, legists, or even were you better judges of\nliberty, of equality, and fraternity than the knife of the guillotine!\nAnd that I announce to you, my fine fellows!”\n\n\n“Parbleu!” cried the lieutenant, “that is wonderfully true.”\n\n\nM. Gillenormand paused in a gesture which he had begun, wheeled round,\nstared Lancer Théodule intently in the eyes, and said to him:—\n\n“You are a fool.”\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SIXTH—THE CONJUNCTION OF TWO STARS\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE SOBRIQUET: MODE OF FORMATION OF FAMILY NAMES\n\n\nMarius was, at this epoch, a handsome young man, of medium stature,\nwith thick and intensely black hair, a lofty and intelligent brow,\nwell-opened and passionate nostrils, an air of calmness and sincerity,\nand with something indescribably proud, thoughtful, and innocent over\nhis whole countenance. His profile, all of whose lines were rounded,\nwithout thereby losing their firmness, had a certain Germanic\nsweetness, which has made its way into the French physiognomy by way of\nAlsace and Lorraine, and that complete absence of angles which rendered\nthe Sicambres so easily recognizable among the Romans, and which\ndistinguishes the leonine from the aquiline race. He was at that period\nof life when the mind of men who think is composed, in nearly equal\nparts, of depth and ingenuousness. A grave situation being given, he\nhad all that is required to be stupid: one more turn of the key, and he\nmight be sublime. His manners were reserved, cold, polished, not very\ngenial. As his mouth was charming, his lips the reddest, and his teeth\nthe whitest in the world, his smile corrected the severity of his face,\nas a whole. At certain moments, that pure brow and that voluptuous\nsmile presented a singular contrast. His eyes were small, but his\nglance was large.\n\nAt the period of his most abject misery, he had observed that young\ngirls turned round when he passed by, and he fled or hid, with death in\nhis soul. He thought that they were staring at him because of his old\nclothes, and that they were laughing at them; the fact is, that they\nstared at him because of his grace, and that they dreamed of him.\n\nThis mute misunderstanding between him and the pretty passers-by had\nmade him shy. He chose none of them for the excellent reason that he\nfled from all of them. He lived thus indefinitely,—stupidly, as\nCourfeyrac said.\n\nCourfeyrac also said to him: “Do not aspire to be venerable” [they\ncalled each other _thou_; it is the tendency of youthful friendships to\nslip into this mode of address]. “Let me give you a piece of advice, my\ndear fellow. Don’t read so many books, and look a little more at the\nlasses. The jades have some good points about them, O Marius! By dint\nof fleeing and blushing, you will become brutalized.”\n\n\nOn other occasions, Courfeyrac encountered him and said:—“Good morning,\nMonsieur l’Abbé!”\n\n\nWhen Courfeyrac had addressed to him some remark of this nature, Marius\navoided women, both young and old, more than ever for a week to come,\nand he avoided Courfeyrac to boot.\n\nNevertheless, there existed in all the immensity of creation, two women\nwhom Marius did not flee, and to whom he paid no attention whatever. In\ntruth, he would have been very much amazed if he had been informed that\nthey were women. One was the bearded old woman who swept out his\nchamber, and caused Courfeyrac to say: “Seeing that his servant woman\nwears his beard, Marius does not wear his own beard.” The other was a\nsort of little girl whom he saw very often, and whom he never looked\nat.\n\nFor more than a year, Marius had noticed in one of the walks of the\nLuxembourg, the one which skirts the parapet of the Pépinière, a man\nand a very young girl, who were almost always seated side by side on\nthe same bench, at the most solitary end of the alley, on the Rue de\nl’Ouest side. Every time that that chance which meddles with the\nstrolls of persons whose gaze is turned inwards, led Marius to that\nwalk,—and it was nearly every day,—he found this couple there. The man\nappeared to be about sixty years of age; he seemed sad and serious; his\nwhole person presented the robust and weary aspect peculiar to military\nmen who have retired from the service. If he had worn a decoration,\nMarius would have said: “He is an ex-officer.” He had a kindly but\nunapproachable air, and he never let his glance linger on the eyes of\nany one. He wore blue trousers, a blue frock coat and a broad-brimmed\nhat, which always appeared to be new, a black cravat, a quaker shirt,\nthat is to say, it was dazzlingly white, but of coarse linen. A\ngrisette who passed near him one day, said: “Here’s a very tidy\nwidower.” His hair was very white.\n\nThe first time that the young girl who accompanied him came and seated\nherself on the bench which they seemed to have adopted, she was a sort\nof child thirteen or fourteen years of age, so thin as to be almost\nhomely, awkward, insignificant, and with a possible promise of handsome\neyes. Only, they were always raised with a sort of displeasing\nassurance. Her dress was both aged and childish, like the dress of the\nscholars in a convent; it consisted of a badly cut gown of black\nmerino. They had the air of being father and daughter.\n\nMarius scanned this old man, who was not yet aged, and this little\ngirl, who was not yet a person, for a few days, and thereafter paid no\nattention to them. They, on their side, did not appear even to see him.\nThey conversed together with a peaceful and indifferent air. The girl\nchattered incessantly and merrily. The old man talked but little, and,\nat times, he fixed on her eyes overflowing with an ineffable paternity.\n\nMarius had acquired the mechanical habit of strolling in that walk. He\ninvariably found them there.\n\nThis is the way things went:—\n\nMarius liked to arrive by the end of the alley which was furthest from\ntheir bench; he walked the whole length of the alley, passed in front\nof them, then returned to the extremity whence he had come, and began\nagain. This he did five or six times in the course of his promenade,\nand the promenade was taken five or six times a week, without its\nhaving occurred to him or to these people to exchange a greeting. That\npersonage, and that young girl, although they appeared,—and perhaps\nbecause they appeared,—to shun all glances, had, naturally, caused some\nattention on the part of the five or six students who strolled along\nthe Pépinière from time to time; the studious after their lectures, the\nothers after their game of billiards. Courfeyrac, who was among the\nlast, had observed them several times, but, finding the girl homely, he\nhad speedily and carefully kept out of the way. He had fled,\ndischarging at them a sobriquet, like a Parthian dart. Impressed solely\nwith the child’s gown and the old man’s hair, he had dubbed the\ndaughter Mademoiselle Lanoire, and the father, Monsieur Leblanc, so\nthat as no one knew them under any other title, this nickname became a\nlaw in the default of any other name. The students said: “Ah! Monsieur\nLeblanc is on his bench.” And Marius, like the rest, had found it\nconvenient to call this unknown gentleman Monsieur Leblanc.\n\nWe shall follow their example, and we shall say M. Leblanc, in order to\nfacilitate this tale.\n\nSo Marius saw them nearly every day, at the same hour, during the first\nyear. He found the man to his taste, but the girl insipid.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—LUX FACTA EST\n\n\nDuring the second year, precisely at the point in this history which\nthe reader has now reached, it chanced that this habit of the\nLuxembourg was interrupted, without Marius himself being quite aware\nwhy, and nearly six months elapsed, during which he did not set foot in\nthe alley. One day, at last, he returned thither once more; it was a\nserene summer morning, and Marius was in joyous mood, as one is when\nthe weather is fine. It seemed to him that he had in his heart all the\nsongs of the birds that he was listening to, and all the bits of blue\nsky of which he caught glimpses through the leaves of the trees.\n\nHe went straight to “his alley,” and when he reached the end of it he\nperceived, still on the same bench, that well-known couple. Only, when\nhe approached, it certainly was the same man; but it seemed to him that\nit was no longer the same girl. The person whom he now beheld was a\ntall and beautiful creature, possessed of all the most charming lines\nof a woman at the precise moment when they are still combined with all\nthe most ingenuous graces of the child; a pure and fugitive moment,\nwhich can be expressed only by these two words,—“fifteen years.” She\nhad wonderful brown hair, shaded with threads of gold, a brow that\nseemed made of marble, cheeks that seemed made of rose-leaf, a pale\nflush, an agitated whiteness, an exquisite mouth, whence smiles darted\nlike sunbeams, and words like music, a head such as Raphael would have\ngiven to Mary, set upon a neck that Jean Goujon would have attributed\nto a Venus. And, in order that nothing might be lacking to this\nbewitching face, her nose was not handsome—it was pretty; neither\nstraight nor curved, neither Italian nor Greek; it was the Parisian\nnose, that is to say, spiritual, delicate, irregular, pure,—which\ndrives painters to despair, and charms poets.\n\nWhen Marius passed near her, he could not see her eyes, which were\nconstantly lowered. He saw only her long chestnut lashes, permeated\nwith shadow and modesty.\n\nThis did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling as she listened\nto what the white-haired old man was saying to her, and nothing could\nbe more fascinating than that fresh smile, combined with those drooping\neyes.\n\nFor a moment, Marius thought that she was another daughter of the same\nman, a sister of the former, no doubt. But when the invariable habit of\nhis stroll brought him, for the second time, near the bench, and he had\nexamined her attentively, he recognized her as the same. In six months\nthe little girl had become a young maiden; that was all. Nothing is\nmore frequent than this phenomenon. There is a moment when girls\nblossom out in the twinkling of an eye, and become roses all at once.\nOne left them children but yesterday; today, one finds them disquieting\nto the feelings.\n\nThis child had not only grown, she had become idealized. As three days\nin April suffice to cover certain trees with flowers, six months had\nsufficed to clothe her with beauty. Her April had arrived.\n\nOne sometimes sees people, who, poor and mean, seem to wake up, pass\nsuddenly from indigence to luxury, indulge in expenditures of all\nsorts, and become dazzling, prodigal, magnificent, all of a sudden.\nThat is the result of having pocketed an income; a note fell due\nyesterday. The young girl had received her quarterly income.\n\nAnd then, she was no longer the school-girl with her felt hat, her\nmerino gown, her scholar’s shoes, and red hands; taste had come to her\nwith beauty; she was a well-dressed person, clad with a sort of rich\nand simple elegance, and without affectation. She wore a dress of black\ndamask, a cape of the same material, and a bonnet of white crape. Her\nwhite gloves displayed the delicacy of the hand which toyed with the\ncarved, Chinese ivory handle of a parasol, and her silken shoe outlined\nthe smallness of her foot. When one passed near her, her whole toilette\nexhaled a youthful and penetrating perfume.\n\nAs for the man, he was the same as usual.\n\nThe second time that Marius approached her, the young girl raised her\neyelids; her eyes were of a deep, celestial blue, but in that veiled\nazure, there was, as yet, nothing but the glance of a child. She looked\nat Marius indifferently, as she would have stared at the brat running\nbeneath the sycamores, or the marble vase which cast a shadow on the\nbench, and Marius, on his side, continued his promenade, and thought\nabout something else.\n\nHe passed near the bench where the young girl sat, five or six times,\nbut without even turning his eyes in her direction.\n\nOn the following days, he returned, as was his wont, to the Luxembourg;\nas usual, he found there “the father and daughter;” but he paid no\nfurther attention to them. He thought no more about the girl now that\nshe was beautiful than he had when she was homely. He passed very near\nthe bench where she sat, because such was his habit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—EFFECT OF THE SPRING\n\n\nOne day, the air was warm, the Luxembourg was inundated with light and\nshade, the sky was as pure as though the angels had washed it that\nmorning, the sparrows were giving vent to little twitters in the depths\nof the chestnut-trees. Marius had thrown open his whole soul to nature,\nhe was not thinking of anything, he simply lived and breathed, he\npassed near the bench, the young girl raised her eyes to him, the two\nglances met.\n\nWhat was there in the young girl’s glance on this occasion? Marius\ncould not have told. There was nothing and there was everything. It was\na strange flash.\n\nShe dropped her eyes, and he pursued his way.\n\nWhat he had just seen was no longer the ingenuous and simple eye of a\nchild; it was a mysterious gulf which had half opened, then abruptly\nclosed again.\n\nThere comes a day when the young girl glances in this manner. Woe to\nhim who chances to be there!\n\nThat first gaze of a soul which does not, as yet, know itself, is like\nthe dawn in the sky. It is the awakening of something radiant and\nstrange. Nothing can give any idea of the dangerous charm of that\nunexpected gleam, which flashes suddenly and vaguely forth from\nadorable shadows, and which is composed of all the innocence of the\npresent, and of all the passion of the future. It is a sort of\nundecided tenderness which reveals itself by chance, and which waits.\nIt is a snare which the innocent maiden sets unknown to herself, and in\nwhich she captures hearts without either wishing or knowing it. It is a\nvirgin looking like a woman.\n\nIt is rare that a profound reverie does not spring from that glance,\nwhere it falls. All purities and all candors meet in that celestial and\nfatal gleam which, more than all the best-planned tender glances of\ncoquettes, possesses the magic power of causing the sudden blossoming,\nin the depths of the soul, of that sombre flower, impregnated with\nperfume and with poison, which is called love.\n\nThat evening, on his return to his garret, Marius cast his eyes over\nhis garments, and perceived, for the first time, that he had been so\nslovenly, indecorous, and inconceivably stupid as to go for his walk in\nthe Luxembourg with his “every-day clothes,” that is to say, with a hat\nbattered near the band, coarse carter’s boots, black trousers which\nshowed white at the knees, and a black coat which was pale at the\nelbows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—BEGINNING OF A GREAT MALADY\n\n\nOn the following day, at the accustomed hour, Marius drew from his\nwardrobe his new coat, his new trousers, his new hat, and his new\nboots; he clothed himself in this complete panoply, put on his gloves,\na tremendous luxury, and set off for the Luxembourg.\n\nOn the way thither, he encountered Courfeyrac, and pretended not to see\nhim. Courfeyrac, on his return home, said to his friends:—\n\n“I have just met Marius’ new hat and new coat, with Marius inside them.\nHe was going to pass an examination, no doubt. He looked utterly\nstupid.”\n\n\nOn arriving at the Luxembourg, Marius made the tour of the fountain\nbasin, and stared at the swans; then he remained for a long time in\ncontemplation before a statue whose head was perfectly black with\nmould, and one of whose hips was missing. Near the basin there was a\nbourgeois forty years of age, with a prominent stomach, who was holding\nby the hand a little urchin of five, and saying to him: “Shun excess,\nmy son, keep at an equal distance from despotism and from anarchy.”\nMarius listened to this bourgeois. Then he made the circuit of the\nbasin once more. At last he directed his course towards “his alley,”\nslowly, and as if with regret. One would have said that he was both\nforced to go there and withheld from doing so. He did not perceive it\nhimself, and thought that he was doing as he always did.\n\nOn turning into the walk, he saw M. Leblanc and the young girl at the\nother end, “on their bench.” He buttoned his coat up to the very top,\npulled it down on his body so that there might be no wrinkles,\nexamined, with a certain complaisance, the lustrous gleams of his\ntrousers, and marched on the bench. This march savored of an attack,\nand certainly of a desire for conquest. So I say that he marched on the\nbench, as I should say: “Hannibal marched on Rome.”\n\n\nHowever, all his movements were purely mechanical, and he had\ninterrupted none of the habitual preoccupations of his mind and labors.\nAt that moment, he was thinking that the _Manuel du Baccalauréat_ was a\nstupid book, and that it must have been drawn up by rare idiots, to\nallow of three tragedies of Racine and only one comedy of Molière being\nanalyzed therein as masterpieces of the human mind. There was a\npiercing whistling going on in his ears. As he approached the bench, he\nheld fast to the folds in his coat, and fixed his eyes on the young\ngirl. It seemed to him that she filled the entire extremity of the\nalley with a vague blue light.\n\nIn proportion as he drew near, his pace slackened more and more. On\narriving at some little distance from the bench, and long before he had\nreached the end of the walk, he halted, and could not explain to\nhimself why he retraced his steps. He did not even say to himself that\nhe would not go as far as the end. It was only with difficulty that the\nyoung girl could have perceived him in the distance and noted his fine\nappearance in his new clothes. Nevertheless, he held himself very\nerect, in case any one should be looking at him from behind.\n\nHe attained the opposite end, then came back, and this time he\napproached a little nearer to the bench. He even got to within three\nintervals of trees, but there he felt an indescribable impossibility of\nproceeding further, and he hesitated. He thought he saw the young\ngirl’s face bending towards him. But he exerted a manly and violent\neffort, subdued his hesitation, and walked straight ahead. A few\nseconds later, he rushed in front of the bench, erect and firm,\nreddening to the very ears, without daring to cast a glance either to\nthe right or to the left, with his hand thrust into his coat like a\nstatesman. At the moment when he passed,—under the cannon of the\nplace,—he felt his heart beat wildly. As on the preceding day, she wore\nher damask gown and her crape bonnet. He heard an ineffable voice,\nwhich must have been “her voice.” She was talking tranquilly. She was\nvery pretty. He felt it, although he made no attempt to see her. “She\ncould not, however,” he thought, “help feeling esteem and consideration\nfor me, if she only knew that I am the veritable author of the\ndissertation on Marcos Obrégon de la Ronde, which M. François de\nNeufchâteau put, as though it were his own, at the head of his edition\nof _Gil Blas_.” He went beyond the bench as far as the extremity of the\nwalk, which was very near, then turned on his heel and passed once more\nin front of the lovely girl. This time, he was very pale. Moreover, all\nhis emotions were disagreeable. As he went further from the bench and\nthe young girl, and while his back was turned to her, he fancied that\nshe was gazing after him, and that made him stumble.\n\nHe did not attempt to approach the bench again; he halted near the\nmiddle of the walk, and there, a thing which he never did, he sat down,\nand reflecting in the most profoundly indistinct depths of his spirit,\nthat after all, it was hard that persons whose white bonnet and black\ngown he admired should be absolutely insensible to his splendid\ntrousers and his new coat.\n\nAt the expiration of a quarter of an hour, he rose, as though he were\non the point of again beginning his march towards that bench which was\nsurrounded by an aureole. But he remained standing there, motionless.\nFor the first time in fifteen months, he said to himself that that\ngentleman who sat there every day with his daughter, had, on his side,\nnoticed him, and probably considered his assiduity singular.\n\nFor the first time, also, he was conscious of some irreverence in\ndesignating that stranger, even in his secret thoughts, by the\nsobriquet of M. Leblanc.\n\nHe stood thus for several minutes, with drooping head, tracing figures\nin the sand, with the cane which he held in his hand.\n\nThen he turned abruptly in the direction opposite to the bench, to M.\nLeblanc and his daughter, and went home.\n\nThat day he forgot to dine. At eight o’clock in the evening he\nperceived this fact, and as it was too late to go down to the Rue\nSaint-Jacques, he said: “Never mind!” and ate a bit of bread.\n\nHe did not go to bed until he had brushed his coat and folded it up\nwith great care.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—DIVERS CLAPS OF THUNDER FALL ON MA’AM BOUGON\n\n\nOn the following day, Ma’am Bougon, as Courfeyrac styled the old\nportress-principal-tenant, housekeeper of the Gorbeau hovel, Ma’am\nBougon, whose name was, in reality, Madame Burgon, as we have found\nout, but this iconoclast, Courfeyrac, respected nothing,—Ma’am Bougon\nobserved, with stupefaction, that M. Marius was going out again in his\nnew coat.\n\nHe went to the Luxembourg again, but he did not proceed further than\nhis bench midway of the alley. He seated himself there, as on the\npreceding day, surveying from a distance, and clearly making out, the\nwhite bonnet, the black dress, and above all, that blue light. He did\nnot stir from it, and only went home when the gates of the Luxembourg\nclosed. He did not see M. Leblanc and his daughter retire. He concluded\nthat they had quitted the garden by the gate on the Rue de l’Ouest.\nLater on, several weeks afterwards, when he came to think it over, he\ncould never recall where he had dined that evening.\n\nOn the following day, which was the third, Ma’am Bougon was\nthunderstruck. Marius went out in his new coat. “Three days in\nsuccession!” she exclaimed.\n\nShe tried to follow him, but Marius walked briskly, and with immense\nstrides; it was a hippopotamus undertaking the pursuit of a chamois.\nShe lost sight of him in two minutes, and returned breathless,\nthree-quarters choked with asthma, and furious. “If there is any\nsense,” she growled, “in putting on one’s best clothes every day, and\nmaking people run like this!”\n\n\nMarius betook himself to the Luxembourg.\n\nThe young girl was there with M. Leblanc. Marius approached as near as\nhe could, pretending to be busy reading a book, but he halted afar off,\nthen returned and seated himself on his bench, where he spent four\nhours in watching the house-sparrows who were skipping about the walk,\nand who produced on him the impression that they were making sport of\nhim.\n\nA fortnight passed thus. Marius went to the Luxembourg no longer for\nthe sake of strolling there, but to seat himself always in the same\nspot, and that without knowing why. Once arrived there, he did not\nstir. He put on his new coat every morning, for the purpose of not\nshowing himself, and he began all over again on the morrow.\n\nShe was decidedly a marvellous beauty. The only remark approaching a\ncriticism, that could be made, was, that the contradiction between her\ngaze, which was melancholy, and her smile, which was merry, gave a\nrather wild effect to her face, which sometimes caused this sweet\ncountenance to become strange without ceasing to be charming.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—TAKEN PRISONER\n\n\nOn one of the last days of the second week, Marius was seated on his\nbench, as usual, holding in his hand an open book, of which he had not\nturned a page for the last two hours. All at once he started. An event\nwas taking place at the other extremity of the walk. Leblanc and his\ndaughter had just left their seat, and the daughter had taken her\nfather’s arm, and both were advancing slowly, towards the middle of the\nalley where Marius was. Marius closed his book, then opened it again,\nthen forced himself to read; he trembled; the aureole was coming\nstraight towards him. “Ah! good Heavens!” thought he, “I shall not have\ntime to strike an attitude.” Still the white-haired man and the girl\nadvanced. It seemed to him that this lasted for a century, and that it\nwas but a second. “What are they coming in this direction for?” he\nasked himself. “What! She will pass here? Her feet will tread this\nsand, this walk, two paces from me?” He was utterly upset, he would\nhave liked to be very handsome, he would have liked to own the cross.\nHe heard the soft and measured sound of their approaching footsteps. He\nimagined that M. Leblanc was darting angry glances at him. “Is that\ngentleman going to address me?” he thought to himself. He dropped his\nhead; when he raised it again, they were very near him. The young girl\npassed, and as she passed, she glanced at him. She gazed steadily at\nhim, with a pensive sweetness which thrilled Marius from head to foot.\nIt seemed to him that she was reproaching him for having allowed so\nlong a time to elapse without coming as far as her, and that she was\nsaying to him: “I am coming myself.” Marius was dazzled by those eyes\nfraught with rays and abysses.\n\nHe felt his brain on fire. She had come to him, what joy! And then, how\nshe had looked at him! She appeared to him more beautiful than he had\never seen her yet. Beautiful with a beauty which was wholly feminine\nand angelic, with a complete beauty which would have made Petrarch sing\nand Dante kneel. It seemed to him that he was floating free in the\nazure heavens. At the same time, he was horribly vexed because there\nwas dust on his boots.\n\nHe thought he felt sure that she had looked at his boots too.\n\nHe followed her with his eyes until she disappeared. Then he started up\nand walked about the Luxembourg garden like a madman. It is possible\nthat, at times, he laughed to himself and talked aloud. He was so\ndreamy when he came near the children’s nurses, that each one of them\nthought him in love with her.\n\nHe quitted the Luxembourg, hoping to find her again in the street.\n\nHe encountered Courfeyrac under the arcades of the Odéon, and said to\nhim: “Come and dine with me.” They went off to Rousseau’s and spent six\nfrancs. Marius ate like an ogre. He gave the waiter six sous. At\ndessert, he said to Courfeyrac. “Have you read the paper? What a fine\ndiscourse Audry de Puyraveau delivered!”\n\n\nHe was desperately in love.\n\nAfter dinner, he said to Courfeyrac: “I will treat you to the play.”\nThey went to the Porte-Sainte-Martin to see Frédérick in _l’Auberge des\nAdrets_. Marius was enormously amused.\n\nAt the same time, he had a redoubled attack of shyness. On emerging\nfrom the theatre, he refused to look at the garter of a modiste who was\nstepping across a gutter, and Courfeyrac, who said: “I should like to\nput that woman in my collection,” almost horrified him.\n\nCourfeyrac invited him to breakfast at the Café Voltaire on the\nfollowing morning. Marius went thither, and ate even more than on the\npreceding evening. He was very thoughtful and very merry. One would\nhave said that he was taking advantage of every occasion to laugh\nuproariously. He tenderly embraced some man or other from the\nprovinces, who was presented to him. A circle of students formed round\nthe table, and they spoke of the nonsense paid for by the State which\nwas uttered from the rostrum in the Sorbonne, then the conversation\nfell upon the faults and omissions in Guicherat’s dictionaries and\ngrammars. Marius interrupted the discussion to exclaim: “But it is very\nagreeable, all the same to have the cross!”\n\n\n“That’s queer!” whispered Courfeyrac to Jean Prouvaire.\n\n“No,” responded Prouvaire, “that’s serious.”\n\n\nIt was serious; in fact, Marius had reached that first violent and\ncharming hour with which grand passions begin.\n\nA glance had wrought all this.\n\nWhen the mine is charged, when the conflagration is ready, nothing is\nmore simple. A glance is a spark.\n\nIt was all over with him. Marius loved a woman. His fate was entering\nthe unknown.\n\nThe glance of women resembles certain combinations of wheels, which are\ntranquil in appearance yet formidable. You pass close to them every\nday, peaceably and with impunity, and without a suspicion of anything.\nA moment arrives when you forget that the thing is there. You go and\ncome, dream, speak, laugh. All at once you feel yourself clutched; all\nis over. The wheels hold you fast, the glance has ensnared you. It has\ncaught you, no matter where or how, by some portion of your thought\nwhich was fluttering loose, by some distraction which had attacked you.\nYou are lost. The whole of you passes into it. A chain of mysterious\nforces takes possession of you. You struggle in vain; no more human\nsuccor is possible. You go on falling from gearing to gearing, from\nagony to agony, from torture to torture, you, your mind, your fortune,\nyour future, your soul; and, according to whether you are in the power\nof a wicked creature, or of a noble heart, you will not escape from\nthis terrifying machine otherwise than disfigured with shame, or\ntransfigured by passion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—ADVENTURES OF THE LETTER U DELIVERED OVER TO CONJECTURES\n\n\nIsolation, detachment, from everything, pride, independence, the taste\nof nature, the absence of daily and material activity, the life within\nhimself, the secret conflicts of chastity, a benevolent ecstasy towards\nall creation, had prepared Marius for this possession which is called\npassion. His worship of his father had gradually become a religion,\nand, like all religions, it had retreated to the depths of his soul.\nSomething was required in the foreground. Love came.\n\nA full month elapsed, during which Marius went every day to the\nLuxembourg. When the hour arrived, nothing could hold him back.—“He is\non duty,” said Courfeyrac. Marius lived in a state of delight. It is\ncertain that the young girl did look at him.\n\nHe had finally grown bold, and approached the bench. Still, he did not\npass in front of it any more, in obedience to the instinct of timidity\nand to the instinct of prudence common to lovers. He considered it\nbetter not to attract “the attention of the father.” He combined his\nstations behind the trees and the pedestals of the statues with a\nprofound diplomacy, so that he might be seen as much as possible by the\nyoung girl and as little as possible by the old gentleman. Sometimes,\nhe remained motionless by the half-hour together in the shade of a\nLeonidas or a Spartacus, holding in his hand a book, above which his\neyes, gently raised, sought the beautiful girl, and she, on her side,\nturned her charming profile towards him with a vague smile. While\nconversing in the most natural and tranquil manner in the world with\nthe white-haired man, she bent upon Marius all the reveries of a\nvirginal and passionate eye. Ancient and time-honored manœuvre which\nEve understood from the very first day of the world, and which every\nwoman understands from the very first day of her life! her mouth\nreplied to one, and her glance replied to another.\n\nIt must be supposed, that M. Leblanc finally noticed something, for\noften, when Marius arrived, he rose and began to walk about. He had\nabandoned their accustomed place and had adopted the bench by the\nGladiator, near the other end of the walk, as though with the object of\nseeing whether Marius would pursue them thither. Marius did not\nunderstand, and committed this error. “The father” began to grow\ninexact, and no longer brought “his daughter” every day. Sometimes, he\ncame alone. Then Marius did not stay. Another blunder.\n\nMarius paid no heed to these symptoms. From the phase of timidity, he\nhad passed, by a natural and fatal progress, to the phase of blindness.\nHis love increased. He dreamed of it every night. And then, an\nunexpected bliss had happened to him, oil on the fire, a redoubling of\nthe shadows over his eyes. One evening, at dusk, he had found, on the\nbench which “M. Leblanc and his daughter” had just quitted, a\nhandkerchief, a very simple handkerchief, without embroidery, but\nwhite, and fine, and which seemed to him to exhale ineffable perfume.\nHe seized it with rapture. This handkerchief was marked with the\nletters U. F. Marius knew nothing about this beautiful child,—neither\nher family name, her Christian name nor her abode; these two letters\nwere the first thing of her that he had gained possession of, adorable\ninitials, upon which he immediately began to construct his scaffolding.\nU was evidently the Christian name. “Ursule!” he thought, “what a\ndelicious name!” He kissed the handkerchief, drank it in, placed it on\nhis heart, on his flesh, during the day, and at night, laid it beneath\nhis lips that he might fall asleep on it.\n\n“I feel that her whole soul lies within it!” he exclaimed.\n\nThis handkerchief belonged to the old gentleman, who had simply let it\nfall from his pocket.\n\nIn the days which followed the finding of this treasure, he only\ndisplayed himself at the Luxembourg in the act of kissing the\nhandkerchief and laying it on his heart. The beautiful child understood\nnothing of all this, and signified it to him by imperceptible signs.\n\n“O modesty!” said Marius.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—THE VETERANS THEMSELVES CAN BE HAPPY\n\n\nSince we have pronounced the word modesty, and since we conceal\nnothing, we ought to say that once, nevertheless, in spite of his\necstasies, “his Ursule” caused him very serious grief. It was on one of\nthe days when she persuaded M. Leblanc to leave the bench and stroll\nalong the walk. A brisk May breeze was blowing, which swayed the crests\nof the plaintain-trees. The father and daughter, arm in arm, had just\npassed Marius’ bench. Marius had risen to his feet behind them, and was\nfollowing them with his eyes, as was fitting in the desperate situation\nof his soul.\n\nAll at once, a gust of wind, more merry than the rest, and probably\ncharged with performing the affairs of Springtime, swept down from the\nnursery, flung itself on the alley, enveloped the young girl in a\ndelicious shiver, worthy of Virgil’s nymphs, and the fawns of\nTheocritus, and lifted her dress, the robe more sacred than that of\nIsis, almost to the height of her garter. A leg of exquisite shape\nappeared. Marius saw it. He was exasperated and furious.\n\nThe young girl had hastily thrust down her dress, with a divinely\ntroubled motion, but he was nonetheless angry for all that. He was\nalone in the alley, it is true. But there might have been some one\nthere. And what if there had been some one there! Can any one\ncomprehend such a thing? What she had just done is horrible!—Alas, the\npoor child had done nothing; there had been but one culprit, the wind;\nbut Marius, in whom quivered the Bartholo who exists in Cherubin, was\ndetermined to be vexed, and was jealous of his own shadow. It is thus,\nin fact, that the harsh and capricious jealousy of the flesh awakens in\nthe human heart, and takes possession of it, even without any right.\nMoreover, setting aside even that jealousy, the sight of that charming\nleg had contained nothing agreeable for him; the white stocking of the\nfirst woman he chanced to meet would have afforded him more pleasure.\n\nWhen “his Ursule,” after having reached the end of the walk, retraced\nher steps with M. Leblanc, and passed in front of the bench on which\nMarius had seated himself once more, Marius darted a sullen and\nferocious glance at her. The young girl gave way to that slight\nstraightening up with a backward movement, accompanied by a raising of\nthe eyelids, which signifies: “Well, what is the matter?”\n\n\nThis was “their first quarrel.”\n\n\nMarius had hardly made this scene at her with his eyes, when some one\ncrossed the walk. It was a veteran, very much bent, extremely wrinkled,\nand pale, in a uniform of the Louis XV. pattern, bearing on his breast\nthe little oval plaque of red cloth, with the crossed swords, the\nsoldier’s cross of Saint-Louis, and adorned, in addition, with a\ncoat-sleeve, which had no arm within it, with a silver chin and a\nwooden leg. Marius thought he perceived that this man had an extremely\nwell satisfied air. It even struck him that the aged cynic, as he\nhobbled along past him, addressed to him a very fraternal and very\nmerry wink, as though some chance had created an understanding between\nthem, and as though they had shared some piece of good luck together.\nWhat did that relic of Mars mean by being so contented? What had passed\nbetween that wooden leg and the other? Marius reached a paroxysm of\njealousy.—“Perhaps he was there!” he said to himself; “perhaps he\nsaw!”—And he felt a desire to exterminate the veteran.\n\nWith the aid of time, all points grow dull. Marius’ wrath against\n“Ursule,” just and legitimate as it was, passed off. He finally\npardoned her; but this cost him a great effort; he sulked for three\ndays.\n\nNevertheless, in spite of all this, and because of all this, his\npassion augmented and grew to madness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—ECLIPSE\n\n\nThe reader has just seen how Marius discovered, or thought that he\ndiscovered, that _She_ was named Ursule.\n\nAppetite grows with loving. To know that her name was Ursule was a\ngreat deal; it was very little. In three or four weeks, Marius had\ndevoured this bliss. He wanted another. He wanted to know where she\nlived.\n\nHe had committed his first blunder, by falling into the ambush of the\nbench by the Gladiator. He had committed a second, by not remaining at\nthe Luxembourg when M. Leblanc came thither alone. He now committed a\nthird, and an immense one. He followed “Ursule.”\n\n\nShe lived in the Rue de l’Ouest, in the most unfrequented spot, in a\nnew, three-story house, of modest appearance.\n\nFrom that moment forth, Marius added to his happiness of seeing her at\nthe Luxembourg the happiness of following her home.\n\nHis hunger was increasing. He knew her first name, at least, a charming\nname, a genuine woman’s name; he knew where she lived; he wanted to\nknow who she was.\n\nOne evening, after he had followed them to their dwelling, and had seen\nthem disappear through the carriage gate, he entered in their train and\nsaid boldly to the porter:—\n\n“Is that the gentleman who lives on the first floor, who has just come\nin?”\n\n\n“No,” replied the porter. “He is the gentleman on the third floor.”\n\n\nAnother step gained. This success emboldened Marius.\n\n“On the front?” he asked.\n\n“Parbleu!” said the porter, “the house is only built on the street.”\n\n\n“And what is that gentleman’s business?” began Marius again.\n\n“He is a gentleman of property, sir. A very kind man who does good to\nthe unfortunate, though not rich himself.”\n\n\n“What is his name?” resumed Marius.\n\nThe porter raised his head and said:—\n\n“Are you a police spy, sir?”\n\n\nMarius went off quite abashed, but delighted. He was getting on.\n\n“Good,” thought he, “I know that her name is Ursule, that she is the\ndaughter of a gentleman who lives on his income, and that she lives\nthere, on the third floor, in the Rue de l’Ouest.”\n\n\nOn the following day, M. Leblanc and his daughter made only a very\nbrief stay in the Luxembourg; they went away while it was still broad\ndaylight. Marius followed them to the Rue de l’Ouest, as he had taken\nup the habit of doing. On arriving at the carriage entrance M. Leblanc\nmade his daughter pass in first, then paused, before crossing the\nthreshold, and stared intently at Marius.\n\nOn the next day they did not come to the Luxembourg. Marius waited for\nthem all day in vain.\n\nAt nightfall, he went to the Rue de l’Ouest, and saw a light in the\nwindows of the third story.\n\nHe walked about beneath the windows until the light was extinguished.\n\nThe next day, no one at the Luxembourg. Marius waited all day, then\nwent and did sentinel duty under their windows. This carried him on to\nten o’clock in the evening.\n\nHis dinner took care of itself. Fever nourishes the sick man, and love\nthe lover.\n\nHe spent a week in this manner. M. Leblanc no longer appeared at the\nLuxembourg.\n\nMarius indulged in melancholy conjectures; he dared not watch the\nporte-cochère during the day; he contented himself with going at night\nto gaze upon the red light of the windows. At times he saw shadows flit\nacross them, and his heart began to beat.\n\nOn the eighth day, when he arrived under the windows, there was no\nlight in them.\n\n“Hello!” he said, “the lamp is not lighted yet. But it is dark. Can\nthey have gone out?” He waited until ten o’clock. Until midnight. Until\none in the morning. Not a light appeared in the windows of the third\nstory, and no one entered the house.\n\nHe went away in a very gloomy frame of mind.\n\nOn the morrow,—for he only existed from morrow to morrow, there was, so\nto speak, no to-day for him,—on the morrow, he found no one at the\nLuxembourg; he had expected this. At dusk, he went to the house.\n\nNo light in the windows; the shades were drawn; the third floor was\ntotally dark.\n\nMarius rapped at the porte-cochère, entered, and said to the porter:—\n\n“The gentleman on the third floor?”\n\n\n“Has moved away,” replied the porter.\n\nMarius reeled and said feebly:—\n\n“How long ago?”\n\n\n“Yesterday.”\n\n\n“Where is he living now?”\n\n\n“I don’t know anything about it.”\n\n\n“So he has not left his new address?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\nAnd the porter, raising his eyes, recognized Marius.\n\n“Come! So it’s you!” said he; “but you are decidedly a spy then?”\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SEVENTH—PATRON MINETTE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—MINES AND MINERS\n\n\nHuman societies all have what is called in theatrical parlance, _a\nthird lower floor_. The social soil is everywhere undermined, sometimes\nfor good, sometimes for evil. These works are superposed one upon the\nother. There are superior mines and inferior mines. There is a top and\na bottom in this obscure sub-soil, which sometimes gives way beneath\ncivilization, and which our indifference and heedlessness trample under\nfoot. The Encyclopedia, in the last century, was a mine that was almost\nopen to the sky. The shades, those sombre hatchers of primitive\nChristianity, only awaited an opportunity to bring about an explosion\nunder the Cæsars and to inundate the human race with light. For in the\nsacred shadows there lies latent light. Volcanoes are full of a shadow\nthat is capable of flashing forth. Every form begins by being night.\nThe catacombs, in which the first mass was said, were not alone the\ncellar of Rome, they were the vaults of the world.\n\nBeneath the social construction, that complicated marvel of a\nstructure, there are excavations of all sorts. There is the religious\nmine, the philosophical mine, the economic mine, the revolutionary\nmine. Such and such a pick-axe with the idea, such a pick with ciphers.\nSuch another with wrath. People hail and answer each other from one\ncatacomb to another. Utopias travel about underground, in the pipes.\nThere they branch out in every direction. They sometimes meet, and\nfraternize there. Jean-Jacques lends his pick to Diogenes, who lends\nhim his lantern. Sometimes they enter into combat there. Calvin seizes\nSocinius by the hair. But nothing arrests nor interrupts the tension of\nall these energies toward the goal, and the vast, simultaneous\nactivity, which goes and comes, mounts, descends, and mounts again in\nthese obscurities, and which immense unknown swarming slowly transforms\nthe top and the bottom and the inside and the outside. Society hardly\neven suspects this digging which leaves its surface intact and changes\nits bowels. There are as many different subterranean stages as there\nare varying works, as there are extractions. What emerges from these\ndeep excavations? The future.\n\nThe deeper one goes, the more mysterious are the toilers. The work is\ngood, up to a degree which the social philosophies are able to\nrecognize; beyond that degree it is doubtful and mixed; lower down, it\nbecomes terrible. At a certain depth, the excavations are no longer\npenetrable by the spirit of civilization, the limit breathable by man\nhas been passed; a beginning of monsters is possible.\n\nThe descending scale is a strange one; and each one of the rungs of\nthis ladder corresponds to a stage where philosophy can find foothold,\nand where one encounters one of these workmen, sometimes divine,\nsometimes misshapen. Below John Huss, there is Luther; below Luther,\nthere is Descartes; below Descartes, there is Voltaire; below Voltaire,\nthere is Condorcet; below Condorcet, there is Robespierre; below\nRobespierre, there is Marat; below Marat there is Babeuf. And so it\ngoes on. Lower down, confusedly, at the limit which separates the\nindistinct from the invisible, one perceives other gloomy men, who\nperhaps do not exist as yet. The men of yesterday are spectres; those\nof to-morrow are forms. The eye of the spirit distinguishes them but\nobscurely. The embryonic work of the future is one of the visions of\nphilosophy.\n\nA world in limbo, in the state of fœtus, what an unheard-of spectre!\n\nSaint-Simon, Owen, Fourier, are there also, in lateral galleries.\n\nSurely, although a divine and invisible chain unknown to themselves,\nbinds together all these subterranean pioneers who, almost always,\nthink themselves isolated, and who are not so, their works vary\ngreatly, and the light of some contrasts with the blaze of others. The\nfirst are paradisiacal, the last are tragic. Nevertheless, whatever may\nbe the contrast, all these toilers, from the highest to the most\nnocturnal, from the wisest to the most foolish, possess one likeness,\nand this is it: disinterestedness. Marat forgets himself like Jesus.\nThey throw themselves on one side, they omit themselves, they think not\nof themselves. They have a glance, and that glance seeks the absolute.\nThe first has the whole heavens in his eyes; the last, enigmatical\nthough he may be, has still, beneath his eyelids, the pale beam of the\ninfinite. Venerate the man, whoever he may be, who has this sign—the\nstarry eye.\n\nThe shadowy eye is the other sign.\n\nWith it, evil commences. Reflect and tremble in the presence of any one\nwho has no glance at all. The social order has its black miners.\n\nThere is a point where depth is tantamount to burial, and where light\nbecomes extinct.\n\nBelow all these mines which we have just mentioned, below all these\ngalleries, below this whole immense, subterranean, venous system of\nprogress and utopia, much further on in the earth, much lower than\nMarat, lower than Babeuf, lower, much lower, and without any connection\nwith the upper levels, there lies the last mine. A formidable spot.\nThis is what we have designated as the _le troisième dessous_. It is\nthe grave of shadows. It is the cellar of the blind. _Inferi_.\n\nThis communicates with the abyss.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—THE LOWEST DEPTHS\n\n\nThere disinterestedness vanishes. The demon is vaguely outlined; each\none is for himself. The _I_ in the eyes howls, seeks, fumbles, and\ngnaws. The social Ugolino is in this gulf.\n\nThe wild spectres who roam in this grave, almost beasts, almost\nphantoms, are not occupied with universal progress; they are ignorant\nboth of the idea and of the word; they take no thought for anything but\nthe satisfaction of their individual desires. They are almost\nunconscious, and there exists within them a sort of terrible\nobliteration. They have two mothers, both step-mothers, ignorance and\nmisery. They have a guide, necessity; and for all forms of\nsatisfaction, appetite. They are brutally voracious, that is to say,\nferocious, not after the fashion of the tyrant, but after the fashion\nof the tiger. From suffering these spectres pass to crime; fatal\naffiliation, dizzy creation, logic of darkness. That which crawls in\nthe social third lower level is no longer complaint stifled by the\nabsolute; it is the protest of matter. Man there becomes a dragon. To\nbe hungry, to be thirsty—that is the point of departure; to be\nSatan—that is the point reached. From that vault Lacenaire emerges.\n\nWe have just seen, in Book Fourth, one of the compartments of the upper\nmine, of the great political, revolutionary, and philosophical\nexcavation. There, as we have just said, all is pure, noble, dignified,\nhonest. There, assuredly, one might be misled; but error is worthy of\nveneration there, so thoroughly does it imply heroism. The work there\neffected, taken as a whole has a name: Progress.\n\nThe moment has now come when we must take a look at other depths,\nhideous depths. There exists beneath society, we insist upon this\npoint, and there will exist, until that day when ignorance shall be\ndissipated, the great cavern of evil.\n\nThis cavern is below all, and is the foe of all. It is hatred, without\nexception. This cavern knows no philosophers; its dagger has never cut\na pen. Its blackness has no connection with the sublime blackness of\nthe inkstand. Never have the fingers of night which contract beneath\nthis stifling ceiling, turned the leaves of a book nor unfolded a\nnewspaper. Babeuf is a speculator to Cartouche; Marat is an aristocrat\nto Schinderhannes. This cavern has for its object the destruction of\neverything.\n\nOf everything. Including the upper superior mines, which it execrates.\nIt not only undermines, in its hideous swarming, the actual social\norder; it undermines philosophy, it undermines human thought, it\nundermines civilization, it undermines revolution, it undermines\nprogress. Its name is simply theft, prostitution, murder,\nassassination. It is darkness, and it desires chaos. Its vault is\nformed of ignorance.\n\nAll the others, those above it, have but one object—to suppress it. It\nis to this point that philosophy and progress tend, with all their\norgans simultaneously, by their amelioration of the real, as well as by\ntheir contemplation of the absolute. Destroy the cavern Ignorance and\nyou destroy the lair Crime.\n\nLet us condense, in a few words, a part of what we have just written.\nThe only social peril is darkness.\n\nHumanity is identity. All men are made of the same clay. There is no\ndifference, here below, at least, in predestination. The same shadow in\nfront, the same flesh in the present, the same ashes afterwards. But\nignorance, mingled with the human paste, blackens it. This incurable\nblackness takes possession of the interior of a man and is there\nconverted into evil.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—BABET, GUEULEMER, CLAQUESOUS, AND MONTPARNASSE\n\n\nA quartette of ruffians, Claquesous, Gueulemer, Babet, and Montparnasse\ngoverned the third lower floor of Paris, from 1830 to 1835.\n\nGueulemer was a Hercules of no defined position. For his lair he had\nthe sewer of the Arche-Marion. He was six feet high, his pectoral\nmuscles were of marble, his biceps of brass, his breath was that of a\ncavern, his torso that of a colossus, his head that of a bird. One\nthought one beheld the Farnese Hercules clad in duck trousers and a\ncotton velvet waistcoat. Gueulemer, built after this sculptural\nfashion, might have subdued monsters; he had found it more expeditious\nto be one. A low brow, large temples, less than forty years of age, but\nwith crow’s-feet, harsh, short hair, cheeks like a brush, a beard like\nthat of a wild boar; the reader can see the man before him. His muscles\ncalled for work, his stupidity would have none of it. He was a great,\nidle force. He was an assassin through coolness. He was thought to be a\ncreole. He had, probably, somewhat to do with Marshal Brune, having\nbeen a porter at Avignon in 1815. After this stage, he had turned\nruffian.\n\nThe diaphaneity of Babet contrasted with the grossness of Gueulemer.\nBabet was thin and learned. He was transparent but impenetrable.\nDaylight was visible through his bones, but nothing through his eyes.\nHe declared that he was a chemist. He had been a jack of all trades. He\nhad played in vaudeville at Saint-Mihiel. He was a man of purpose, a\nfine talker, who underlined his smiles and accentuated his gestures.\nHis occupation consisted in selling, in the open air, plaster busts and\nportraits of “the head of the State.” In addition to this, he extracted\nteeth. He had exhibited phenomena at fairs, and he had owned a booth\nwith a trumpet and this poster: “Babet, Dental Artist, Member of the\nAcademies, makes physical experiments on metals and metalloids,\nextracts teeth, undertakes stumps abandoned by his brother\npractitioners. Price: one tooth, one franc, fifty centimes; two teeth,\ntwo francs; three teeth, two francs, fifty. Take advantage of this\nopportunity.” This _Take advantage of this opportunity_ meant: Have as\nmany teeth extracted as possible. He had been married and had had\nchildren. He did not know what had become of his wife and children. He\nhad lost them as one loses his handkerchief. Babet read the papers, a\nstriking exception in the world to which he belonged. One day, at the\nperiod when he had his family with him in his booth on wheels, he had\nread in the _Messager_, that a woman had just given birth to a child,\nwho was doing well, and had a calf’s muzzle, and he exclaimed: “There’s\na fortune! my wife has not the wit to present me with a child like\nthat!”\n\n\nLater on he had abandoned everything, in order to “undertake Paris.”\nThis was his expression.\n\nWho was Claquesous? He was night. He waited until the sky was daubed\nwith black, before he showed himself. At nightfall he emerged from the\nhole whither he returned before daylight. Where was this hole? No one\nknew. He only addressed his accomplices in the most absolute darkness,\nand with his back turned to them. Was his name Claquesous? Certainly\nnot. If a candle was brought, he put on a mask. He was a ventriloquist.\nBabet said: “Claquesous is a nocturne for two voices.” Claquesous was\nvague, terrible, and a roamer. No one was sure whether he had a name,\nClaquesous being a sobriquet; none was sure that he had a voice, as his\nstomach spoke more frequently than his voice; no one was sure that he\nhad a face, as he was never seen without his mask. He disappeared as\nthough he had vanished into thin air; when he appeared, it was as\nthough he sprang from the earth.\n\nA lugubrious being was Montparnasse. Montparnasse was a child; less\nthan twenty years of age, with a handsome face, lips like cherries,\ncharming black hair, the brilliant light of springtime in his eyes; he\nhad all vices and aspired to all crimes.\n\nThe digestion of evil aroused in him an appetite for worse. It was the\nstreet boy turned pickpocket, and a pickpocket turned garroter. He was\ngenteel, effeminate, graceful, robust, sluggish, ferocious. The rim of\nhis hat was curled up on the left side, in order to make room for a\ntuft of hair, after the style of 1829. He lived by robbery with\nviolence. His coat was of the best cut, but threadbare. Montparnasse\nwas a fashion-plate in misery and given to the commission of murders.\nThe cause of all this youth’s crimes was the desire to be well-dressed.\nThe first grisette who had said to him: “You are handsome!” had cast\nthe stain of darkness into his heart, and had made a Cain of this Abel.\nFinding that he was handsome, he desired to be elegant: now, the height\nof elegance is idleness; idleness in a poor man means crime. Few\nprowlers were so dreaded as Montparnasse. At eighteen, he had already\nnumerous corpses in his past. More than one passer-by lay with\noutstretched arms in the presence of this wretch, with his face in a\npool of blood. Curled, pomaded, with laced waist, the hips of a woman,\nthe bust of a Prussian officer, the murmur of admiration from the\nboulevard wenches surrounding him, his cravat knowingly tied, a\nbludgeon in his pocket, a flower in his buttonhole; such was this dandy\nof the sepulchre.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—COMPOSITION OF THE TROUPE\n\n\nThese four ruffians formed a sort of Proteus, winding like a serpent\namong the police, and striving to escape Vidocq’s indiscreet glances\n“under divers forms, tree, flame, fountain,” lending each other their\nnames and their traps, hiding in their own shadows, boxes with secret\ncompartments and refuges for each other, stripping off their\npersonalities, as one removes his false nose at a masked ball,\nsometimes simplifying matters to the point of consisting of but one\nindividual, sometimes multiplying themselves to such a point that\nCoco-Latour himself took them for a whole throng.\n\nThese four men were not four men; they were a sort of mysterious robber\nwith four heads, operating on a grand scale on Paris; they were that\nmonstrous polyp of evil, which inhabits the crypt of society.\n\nThanks to their ramifications, and to the network underlying their\nrelations, Babet, Gueulemer, Claquesous, and Montparnasse were charged\nwith the general enterprise of the ambushes of the department of the\nSeine. The inventors of ideas of that nature, men with nocturnal\nimaginations, applied to them to have their ideas executed. They\nfurnished the canvas to the four rascals, and the latter undertook the\npreparation of the scenery. They labored at the stage setting. They\nwere always in a condition to lend a force proportioned and suitable to\nall crimes which demanded a lift of the shoulder, and which were\nsufficiently lucrative. When a crime was in quest of arms, they\nunder-let their accomplices. They kept a troupe of actors of the\nshadows at the disposition of all underground tragedies.\n\nThey were in the habit of assembling at nightfall, the hour when they\nwoke up, on the plains which adjoin the Salpêtrière. There they held\ntheir conferences. They had twelve black hours before them; they\nregulated their employment accordingly.\n\n_Patron-Minette_,—such was the name which was bestowed in the\nsubterranean circulation on the association of these four men. In the\nfantastic, ancient, popular parlance, which is vanishing day by day,\n_Patron-Minette_ signifies the morning, the same as _entre chien et\nloup_—between dog and wolf—signifies the evening. This appellation,\n_Patron-Minette_, was probably derived from the hour at which their\nwork ended, the dawn being the vanishing moment for phantoms and for\nthe separation of ruffians. These four men were known under this title.\nWhen the President of the Assizes visited Lacenaire in his prison, and\nquestioned him concerning a misdeed which Lacenaire denied, “Who did\nit?” demanded the President. Lacenaire made this response, enigmatical\nso far as the magistrate was concerned, but clear to the police:\n“Perhaps it was Patron-Minette.”\n\n\nA piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the personages;\nin the same manner a band can almost be judged from the list of\nruffians composing it. Here are the appellations to which the principal\nmembers of Patron-Minette answered,—for the names have survived in\nspecial memoirs.\n\nPanchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille.\n\nBrujon. [There was a Brujon dynasty; we cannot refrain from\ninterpolating this word.]\n\nBoulatruelle, the road-mender already introduced.\n\nLaveuve.\n\nFinistère.\n\nHomère-Hogu, a negro.\n\nMardisoir. (Tuesday evening.)\n\nDépêche. (Make haste.)\n\nFauntleroy, alias Bouquetière (the Flower Girl).\n\nGlorieux, a discharged convict.\n\nBarrecarrosse (Stop-carriage), called Monsieur Dupont.\n\nL’Esplanade-du-Sud.\n\nPoussagrive.\n\nCarmagnolet.\n\nKruideniers, called Bizarro.\n\nMangedentelle. (Lace-eater.)\n\nLes-pieds-en-l’Air. (Feet in the air.)\n\nDemi-Liard, called Deux-Milliards.\n\nEtc., etc.\n\nWe pass over some, and not the worst of them. These names have faces\nattached. They do not express merely beings, but species. Each one of\nthese names corresponds to a variety of those misshapen fungi from the\nunder side of civilization.\n\nThose beings, who were not very lavish with their countenances, were\nnot among the men whom one sees passing along the streets. Fatigued by\nthe wild nights which they passed, they went off by day to sleep,\nsometimes in the lime-kilns, sometimes in the abandoned quarries of\nMontmatre or Montrouge, sometimes in the sewers. They ran to earth.\n\nWhat became of these men? They still exist. They have always existed.\nHorace speaks of them: _Ambubaiarum collegia, pharmacopolæ, mendici,\nmimæ_; and so long as society remains what it is, they will remain what\nthey are. Beneath the obscure roof of their cavern, they are\ncontinually born again from the social ooze. They return, spectres, but\nalways identical; only, they no longer bear the same names and they are\nno longer in the same skins. The individuals extirpated, the tribe\nsubsists.\n\nThey always have the same faculties. From the vagrant to the tramp, the\nrace is maintained in its purity. They divine purses in pockets, they\nscent out watches in fobs. Gold and silver possess an odor for them.\nThere exist ingenuous bourgeois, of whom it might be said, that they\nhave a “stealable” air. These men patiently pursue these bourgeois.\nThey experience the quivers of a spider at the passage of a stranger or\nof a man from the country.\n\nThese men are terrible, when one encounters them, or catches a glimpse\nof them, towards midnight, on a deserted boulevard. They do not seem to\nbe men but forms composed of living mists; one would say that they\nhabitually constitute one mass with the shadows, that they are in no\nwise distinct from them, that they possess no other soul than the\ndarkness, and that it is only momentarily and for the purpose of living\nfor a few minutes a monstrous life, that they have separated from the\nnight.\n\nWhat is necessary to cause these spectres to vanish? Light. Light in\nfloods. Not a single bat can resist the dawn. Light up society from\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHTH—THE WICKED POOR MAN\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—MARIUS, WHILE SEEKING A GIRL IN A BONNET, ENCOUNTERS A MAN IN\nA CAP\n\n\nSummer passed, then the autumn; winter came. Neither M. Leblanc nor the\nyoung girl had again set foot in the Luxembourg garden. Thenceforth,\nMarius had but one thought,—to gaze once more on that sweet and\nadorable face. He sought constantly, he sought everywhere; he found\nnothing. He was no longer Marius, the enthusiastic dreamer, the firm,\nresolute, ardent man, the bold defier of fate, the brain which erected\nfuture on future, the young spirit encumbered with plans, with\nprojects, with pride, with ideas and wishes; he was a lost dog. He fell\ninto a black melancholy. All was over. Work disgusted him, walking\ntired him. Vast nature, formerly so filled with forms, lights, voices,\ncounsels, perspectives, horizons, teachings, now lay empty before him.\nIt seemed to him that everything had disappeared.\n\nHe thought incessantly, for he could not do otherwise; but he no longer\ntook pleasure in his thoughts. To everything that they proposed to him\nin a whisper, he replied in his darkness: “What is the use?”\n\n\nHe heaped a hundred reproaches on himself. “Why did I follow her? I was\nso happy at the mere sight of her! She looked at me; was not that\nimmense? She had the air of loving me. Was not that everything? I\nwished to have, what? There was nothing after that. I have been absurd.\nIt is my own fault,” etc., etc. Courfeyrac, to whom he confided\nnothing,—it was his nature,—but who made some little guess at\neverything,—that was his nature,—had begun by congratulating him on\nbeing in love, though he was amazed at it; then, seeing Marius fall\ninto this melancholy state, he ended by saying to him: “I see that you\nhave been simply an animal. Here, come to the Chaumière.”\n\n\nOnce, having confidence in a fine September sun, Marius had allowed\nhimself to be taken to the ball at Sceaux by Courfeyrac, Bossuet, and\nGrantaire, hoping, what a dream! that he might, perhaps, find her\nthere. Of course he did not see the one he sought.—“But this is the\nplace, all the same, where all lost women are found,” grumbled\nGrantaire in an aside. Marius left his friends at the ball and returned\nhome on foot, alone, through the night, weary, feverish, with sad and\ntroubled eyes, stunned by the noise and dust of the merry wagons filled\nwith singing creatures on their way home from the feast, which passed\nclose to him, as he, in his discouragement, breathed in the acrid scent\nof the walnut-trees, along the road, in order to refresh his head.\n\nHe took to living more and more alone, utterly overwhelmed, wholly\ngiven up to his inward anguish, going and coming in his pain like the\nwolf in the trap, seeking the absent one everywhere, stupefied by love.\n\nOn another occasion, he had an encounter which produced on him a\nsingular effect. He met, in the narrow streets in the vicinity of the\nBoulevard des Invalides, a man dressed like a workingman and wearing a\ncap with a long visor, which allowed a glimpse of locks of very white\nhair. Marius was struck with the beauty of this white hair, and\nscrutinized the man, who was walking slowly and as though absorbed in\npainful meditation. Strange to say, he thought that he recognized M.\nLeblanc. The hair was the same, also the profile, so far as the cap\npermitted a view of it, the mien identical, only more depressed. But\nwhy these workingman’s clothes? What was the meaning of this? What\nsignified that disguise? Marius was greatly astonished. When he\nrecovered himself, his first impulse was to follow the man; who knows\nwhether he did not hold at last the clue which he was seeking? In any\ncase, he must see the man near at hand, and clear up the mystery. But\nthe idea occurred to him too late, the man was no longer there. He had\nturned into some little side street, and Marius could not find him.\nThis encounter occupied his mind for three days and then was effaced.\n“After all,” he said to himself, “it was probably only a resemblance.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—TREASURE TROVE\n\n\nMarius had not left the Gorbeau house. He paid no attention to any one\nthere.\n\nAt that epoch, to tell the truth, there were no other inhabitants in\nthe house, except himself and those Jondrettes whose rent he had once\npaid, without, moreover, ever having spoken to either father, mother,\nor daughters. The other lodgers had moved away or had died, or had been\nturned out in default of payment.\n\nOne day during that winter, the sun had shown itself a little in the\nafternoon, but it was the 2d of February, that ancient Candlemas day\nwhose treacherous sun, the precursor of a six weeks’ cold spell,\ninspired Mathieu Laensberg with these two lines, which have with\njustice remained classic:—\n\nQu’il luise ou qu’il luiserne,\nL’ours rentre dans en sa caverne.26\n\n\nMarius had just emerged from his: night was falling. It was the hour\nfor his dinner; for he had been obliged to take to dining again, alas!\noh, infirmities of ideal passions!\n\nHe had just crossed his threshold, where Ma’am Bougon was sweeping at\nthe moment, as she uttered this memorable monologue:—\n\n“What is there that is cheap now? Everything is dear. There is nothing\nin the world that is cheap except trouble; you can get that for\nnothing, the trouble of the world!”\n\n\nMarius slowly ascended the boulevard towards the barrier, in order to\nreach the Rue Saint-Jacques. He was walking along with drooping head.\n\nAll at once, he felt some one elbow him in the dusk; he wheeled round,\nand saw two young girls clad in rags, the one tall and slim, the other\na little shorter, who were passing rapidly, all out of breath, in\nterror, and with the appearance of fleeing; they had been coming to\nmeet him, had not seen him, and had jostled him as they passed. Through\nthe twilight, Marius could distinguish their livid faces, their wild\nheads, their dishevelled hair, their hideous bonnets, their ragged\npetticoats, and their bare feet. They were talking as they ran. The\ntaller said in a very low voice:—\n\n“The bobbies have come. They came near nabbing me at the half-circle.”\nThe other answered: “I saw them. I bolted, bolted, bolted!”\n\n\nThrough this repulsive slang, Marius understood that gendarmes or the\npolice had come near apprehending these two children, and that the\nlatter had escaped.\n\nThey plunged among the trees of the boulevard behind him, and there\ncreated, for a few minutes, in the gloom, a sort of vague white spot,\nthen disappeared.\n\nMarius had halted for a moment.\n\nHe was about to pursue his way, when his eye lighted on a little\ngrayish package lying on the ground at his feet. He stooped and picked\nit up. It was a sort of envelope which appeared to contain papers.\n\n“Good,” he said to himself, “those unhappy girls dropped it.”\n\n\nHe retraced his steps, he called, he did not find them; he reflected\nthat they must already be far away, put the package in his pocket, and\nwent off to dine.\n\nOn the way, he saw in an alley of the Rue Mouffetard, a child’s coffin,\ncovered with a black cloth resting on three chairs, and illuminated by\na candle. The two girls of the twilight recurred to his mind.\n\n“Poor mothers!” he thought. “There is one thing sadder than to see\none’s children die; it is to see them leading an evil life.”\n\n\nThen those shadows which had varied his melancholy vanished from his\nthoughts, and he fell back once more into his habitual preoccupations.\nHe fell to thinking once more of his six months of love and happiness\nin the open air and the broad daylight, beneath the beautiful trees of\nLuxembourg.\n\n“How gloomy my life has become!” he said to himself. “Young girls are\nalways appearing to me, only formerly they were angels and now they are\nghouls.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—QUADRIFRONS\n\n\nThat evening, as he was undressing preparatory to going to bed, his\nhand came in contact, in the pocket of his coat, with the packet which\nhe had picked up on the boulevard. He had forgotten it. He thought that\nit would be well to open it, and that this package might possibly\ncontain the address of the young girls, if it really belonged to them,\nand, in any case, the information necessary to a restitution to the\nperson who had lost it.\n\nHe opened the envelope.\n\nIt was not sealed and contained four letters, also unsealed.\n\nThey bore addresses.\n\nAll four exhaled a horrible odor of tobacco.\n\nThe first was addressed: _“To Madame, Madame la Marquise de Grucheray,\nthe place opposite the Chamber of Deputies, No.—”_\n\nMarius said to himself, that he should probably find in it the\ninformation which he sought, and that, moreover, the letter being open,\nit was probable that it could be read without impropriety.\n\nIt was conceived as follows:—\n\nMadame la Marquise: The virtue of clemency and piety is that which most\nclosely unites sosiety. Turn your Christian spirit and cast a look of\ncompassion on this unfortunate Spanish victim of loyalty and attachment\nto the sacred cause of legitimacy, who has given with his blood,\nconsecrated his fortune, evverything, to defend that cause, and to-day\nfinds himself in the greatest missery. He doubts not that your\nhonorable person will grant succor to preserve an existence exteremely\npainful for a military man of education and honor full of wounds,\ncounts in advance on the humanity which animates you and on the\ninterest which Madame la Marquise bears to a nation so unfortunate.\nTheir prayer will not be in vain, and their gratitude will preserve\ntheirs charming souvenir.\n\nMy respectful sentiments, with which I have the honor to be\nMadame,\nDon Alvarès, Spanish Captain\nof Cavalry, a royalist who\nhas take refuge in France,\nwho finds himself on travells\nfor his country, and the\nresources are lacking him to\ncontinue his travells.\n\n\nNo address was joined to the signature. Marius hoped to find the\naddress in the second letter, whose superscription read: _À Madame,\nMadame la Comtesse de Montvernet, Rue Cassette, No. 9_. This is what\nMarius read in it:—\n\nMadame la Comtesse:  It is an unhappy mother of a family of six\nchildren the last of which is only eight months old.  I sick\nsince my last confinement, abandoned by my husband five months ago,\nhaveing no resources in the world the most frightful indigance.\n\nIn the hope of Madame la Comtesse, she has the honor to be,\nMadame, with profound respect,\nMistress Balizard.\n\n\nMarius turned to the third letter, which was a petition like the\npreceding; he read:—\n\nMonsieur Pabourgeot, Elector, wholesale stocking merchant,\nRue Saint-Denis on the corner of the Rue aux Fers.\n\nI permit myself to address you this letter to beg you to grant me\nthe pretious favor of your simpaties and to interest yourself in a man\nof letters who has just sent a drama to the Théâtre-Français. The subject\nis historical, and the action takes place in Auvergne in the time\nof the Empire; the style, I think, is natural, laconic, and may have\nsome merit.  There are couplets to be sung in four places.  The comic,\nthe serious, the unexpected, are mingled in a variety of characters,\nand a tinge of romanticism lightly spread through all the intrigue\nwhich proceeds misteriously, and ends, after striking altarations,\nin the midst of many beautiful strokes of brilliant scenes.\n\nMy principal object is to satisfi the desire which progressively\nanimates the man of our century, that is to say, the fashion,\nthat capritious and bizarre weathervane which changes at almost\nevery new wind.\n\nIn spite of these qualities I have reason to fear that jealousy,\nthe egotism of priviliged authors, may obtaine my exclusion from\nthe theatre, for I am not ignorant of the mortifications with which\nnewcomers are treated.\n\nMonsiuer Pabourgeot, your just reputation as an enlightened protector\nof men of litters emboldens me to send you my daughter who will\nexplain our indigant situation to you, lacking bread and fire\nin this wynter season.  When I say to you that I beg you to accept\nthe dedication of my drama which I desire to make to you and of all\nthose that I shall make, is to prove to you how great is my ambition\nto have the honor of sheltering myself under your protection,\nand of adorning my writings with your name.  If you deign to honor\nme with the most modest offering, I shall immediately occupy myself\nin making a piesse of verse to pay you my tribute of gratitude.\nWhich I shall endeavor to render this piesse as perfect as possible,\nwill be sent to you before it is inserted at the beginning of the\ndrama and delivered on the stage.\nTo Monsieur\nand Madame Pabourgeot,\nMy most respectful complements,\nGenflot, man of letters.\nP. S. Even if it is only forty sous.\n\nExcuse me for sending my daughter and not presenting myself,\nbut sad motives connected with the toilet do not permit me,\nalas! to go out.\n\n\nFinally, Marius opened the fourth letter. The address ran: _To the\nbenevolent Gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacques-du-haut-Pas_. It\ncontained the following lines:—\n\nBenevolent Man:  If you deign to accompany my daughter, you will\nbehold a misserable calamity, and I will show you my certificates.\n\nAt the aspect of these writings your generous soul will be moved\nwith a sentiment of obvious benevolence, for true philosophers\nalways feel lively emotions.\n\nAdmit, compassionate man, that it is necessary to suffer the most\ncruel need, and that it is very painful, for the sake of obtaining\na little relief, to get oneself attested by the authorities as though\none were not free to suffer and to die of inanition while waiting\nto have our misery relieved.  Destinies are very fatal for several\nand too prodigal or too protecting for others.\n\nI await your presence or your offering, if you deign to make one,\nand I beseech you to accept the respectful sentiments with which I\nhave the honor to be,\ntruly magnanimous man,\nyour very humble\nand very obedient servant,\nP. Fabantou, dramatic artist.\n\n\nAfter perusing these four letters, Marius did not find himself much\nfurther advanced than before.\n\nIn the first place, not one of the signers gave his address.\n\nThen, they seemed to come from four different individuals, Don Alvarès,\nMistress Balizard, the poet Genflot, and dramatic artist Fabantou; but\nthe singular thing about these letters was, that all four were written\nby the same hand.\n\nWhat conclusion was to be drawn from this, except that they all come\nfrom the same person?\n\nMoreover, and this rendered the conjecture all the more probable, the\ncoarse and yellow paper was the same in all four, the odor of tobacco\nwas the same, and, although an attempt had been made to vary the style,\nthe same orthographical faults were reproduced with the greatest\ntranquillity, and the man of letters Genflot was no more exempt from\nthem than the Spanish captain.\n\nIt was waste of trouble to try to solve this petty mystery. Had it not\nbeen a chance find, it would have borne the air of a mystification.\nMarius was too melancholy to take even a chance pleasantry well, and to\nlend himself to a game which the pavement of the street seemed desirous\nof playing with him. It seemed to him that he was playing the part of\nthe blind man in blind man’s buff between the four letters, and that\nthey were making sport of him.\n\nNothing, however, indicated that these letters belonged to the two\nyoung girls whom Marius had met on the boulevard. After all, they were\nevidently papers of no value. Marius replaced them in their envelope,\nflung the whole into a corner and went to bed. About seven o’clock in\nthe morning, he had just risen and breakfasted, and was trying to\nsettle down to work, when there came a soft knock at his door.\n\nAs he owned nothing, he never locked his door, unless occasionally,\nthough very rarely, when he was engaged in some pressing work. Even\nwhen absent he left his key in the lock. “You will be robbed,” said\nMa’am Bougon. “Of what?” said Marius. The truth is, however, that he\nhad, one day, been robbed of an old pair of boots, to the great triumph\nof Ma’am Bougon.\n\nThere came a second knock, as gentle as the first.\n\n“Come in,” said Marius.\n\nThe door opened.\n\n“What do you want, Ma’am Bougon?” asked Marius, without raising his\neyes from the books and manuscripts on his table.\n\nA voice which did not belong to Ma’am Bougon replied:—\n\n“Excuse me, sir—”\n\n\nIt was a dull, broken, hoarse, strangled voice, the voice of an old\nman, roughened with brandy and liquor.\n\nMarius turned round hastily, and beheld a young girl.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—A ROSE IN MISERY\n\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nRose in Misery  3b8-4-rose-in-misery\n\n\nA very young girl was standing in the half-open door. The dormer window\nof the garret, through which the light fell, was precisely opposite the\ndoor, and illuminated the figure with a wan light. She was a frail,\nemaciated, slender creature; there was nothing but a chemise and a\npetticoat upon that chilled and shivering nakedness. Her girdle was a\nstring, her head ribbon a string, her pointed shoulders emerged from\nher chemise, a blond and lymphatic pallor, earth-colored collar-bones,\nred hands, a half-open and degraded mouth, missing teeth, dull, bold,\nbase eyes; she had the form of a young girl who has missed her youth,\nand the look of a corrupt old woman; fifty years mingled with fifteen;\none of those beings which are both feeble and horrible, and which cause\nthose to shudder whom they do not cause to weep.\n\nMarius had risen, and was staring in a sort of stupor at this being,\nwho was almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams.\n\nThe most heart-breaking thing of all was, that this young girl had not\ncome into the world to be homely. In her early childhood she must even\nhave been pretty. The grace of her age was still struggling against the\nhideous, premature decrepitude of debauchery and poverty. The remains\nof beauty were dying away in that face of sixteen, like the pale\nsunlight which is extinguished under hideous clouds at dawn on a\nwinter’s day.\n\nThat face was not wholly unknown to Marius. He thought he remembered\nhaving seen it somewhere.\n\n“What do you wish, Mademoiselle?” he asked.\n\nThe young girl replied in her voice of a drunken convict:—\n\n“Here is a letter for you, Monsieur Marius.”\n\n\nShe called Marius by his name; he could not doubt that he was the\nperson whom she wanted; but who was this girl? How did she know his\nname?\n\nWithout waiting for him to tell her to advance, she entered. She\nentered resolutely, staring, with a sort of assurance that made the\nheart bleed, at the whole room and the unmade bed. Her feet were bare.\nLarge holes in her petticoat permitted glimpses of her long legs and\nher thin knees. She was shivering.\n\nShe held a letter in her hand, which she presented to Marius.\n\nMarius, as he opened the letter, noticed that the enormous wafer which\nsealed it was still moist. The message could not have come from a\ndistance. He read:—\n\nMy amiable neighbor, young man:  I have learned of your goodness to me,\nthat you paid my rent six months ago.  I bless you, young man.\nMy eldest daughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel\nof bread for two days, four persons and my spouse ill.  If I am\nnot deseaved in my opinion, I think I may hope that your generous\nheart will melt at this statement and the desire will subjugate you\nto be propitious to me by daigning to lavish on me a slight favor.\n\nI am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the\nbenefactors of humanity,—\n\nJondrette.\n\nP.S. My eldest daughter will await your orders, dear Monsieur Marius.\n\n\nThis letter, coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which\nhad occupied Marius’ thoughts ever since the preceding evening, was\nlike a candle in a cellar. All was suddenly illuminated.\n\nThis letter came from the same place as the other four. There was the\nsame writing, the same style, the same orthography, the same paper, the\nsame odor of tobacco.\n\nThere were five missives, five histories, five signatures, and a single\nsigner. The Spanish Captain Don Alvarès, the unhappy Mistress Balizard,\nthe dramatic poet Genflot, the old comedian Fabantou, were all four\nnamed Jondrette, if, indeed, Jondrette himself were named Jondrette.\n\nMarius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time, and he had\nhad, as we have said, but very rare occasion to see, to even catch a\nglimpse of, his extremely mean neighbors. His mind was elsewhere, and\nwhere the mind is, there the eyes are also. He had been obliged more\nthan once to pass the Jondrettes in the corridor or on the stairs; but\nthey were mere forms to him; he had paid so little heed to them, that,\non the preceding evening, he had jostled the Jondrette girls on the\nboulevard, without recognizing them, for it had evidently been they,\nand it was with great difficulty that the one who had just entered his\nroom had awakened in him, in spite of disgust and pity, a vague\nrecollection of having met her elsewhere.\n\nNow he saw everything clearly. He understood that his neighbor\nJondrette, in his distress, exercised the industry of speculating on\nthe charity of benevolent persons, that he procured addresses, and that\nhe wrote under feigned names to people whom he judged to be wealthy and\ncompassionate, letters which his daughters delivered at their risk and\nperil, for this father had come to such a pass, that he risked his\ndaughters; he was playing a game with fate, and he used them as the\nstake. Marius understood that probably, judging from their flight on\nthe evening before, from their breathless condition, from their terror\nand from the words of slang which he had overheard, these unfortunate\ncreatures were plying some inexplicably sad profession, and that the\nresult of the whole was, in the midst of human society, as it is now\nconstituted, two miserable beings who were neither girls nor women, a\nspecies of impure and innocent monsters produced by misery.\n\nSad creatures, without name, or sex, or age, to whom neither good nor\nevil were any longer possible, and who, on emerging from childhood,\nhave already nothing in this world, neither liberty, nor virtue, nor\nresponsibility. Souls which blossomed out yesterday, and are faded\nto-day, like those flowers let fall in the streets, which are soiled\nwith every sort of mire, while waiting for some wheel to crush them.\nNevertheless, while Marius bent a pained and astonished gaze on her,\nthe young girl was wandering back and forth in the garret with the\naudacity of a spectre. She kicked about, without troubling herself as\nto her nakedness. Occasionally her chemise, which was untied and torn,\nfell almost to her waist. She moved the chairs about, she disarranged\nthe toilet articles which stood on the commode, she handled Marius’\nclothes, she rummaged about to see what there was in the corners.\n\n“Hullo!” said she, “you have a mirror!”\n\n\nAnd she hummed scraps of vaudevilles, as though she had been alone,\nfrolicsome refrains which her hoarse and guttural voice rendered\nlugubrious.\n\nAn indescribable constraint, weariness, and humiliation were\nperceptible beneath this hardihood. Effrontery is a disgrace.\n\nNothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room,\nand, so to speak, flit with the movements of a bird which is frightened\nby the daylight, or which has broken its wing. One felt that under\nother conditions of education and destiny, the gay and over-free mien\nof this young girl might have turned out sweet and charming. Never,\neven among animals, does the creature born to be a dove change into an\nosprey. That is only to be seen among men.\n\nMarius reflected, and allowed her to have her way.\n\nShe approached the table.\n\n“Ah!” said she, “books!”\n\n\nA flash pierced her glassy eye. She resumed, and her accent expressed\nthe happiness which she felt in boasting of something, to which no\nhuman creature is insensible:—\n\n“I know how to read, I do!”\n\n\nShe eagerly seized a book which lay open on the table, and read with\ntolerable fluency:—\n\n“—General Bauduin received orders to take the château of Hougomont\nwhich stands in the middle of the plain of Waterloo, with five\nbattalions of his brigade.”\n\n\nShe paused.\n\n“Ah! Waterloo! I know about that. It was a battle long ago. My father\nwas there. My father has served in the armies. We are fine Bonapartists\nin our house, that we are! Waterloo was against the English.”\n\n\nShe laid down the book, caught up a pen, and exclaimed:—\n\n“And I know how to write, too!”\n\n\nShe dipped her pen in the ink, and turning to Marius:—\n\n“Do you want to see? Look here, I’m going to write a word to show you.”\n\n\nAnd before he had time to answer, she wrote on a sheet of white paper,\nwhich lay in the middle of the table: “The bobbies are here.”\n\n\nThen throwing down the pen:—\n\n“There are no faults of orthography. You can look. We have received an\neducation, my sister and I. We have not always been as we are now. We\nwere not made—”\n\n\nHere she paused, fixed her dull eyes on Marius, and burst out laughing,\nsaying, with an intonation which contained every form of anguish,\nstifled by every form of cynicism:—\n\n“Bah!”\n\n\nAnd she began to hum these words to a gay air:—\n\n“J’ai faim, mon père.”      I am hungry, father.\nPas de fricot.             I have no food.\nJ’ai froid, ma mère.       I am cold, mother.\nPas de tricot.             I have no clothes.\nGrelotte,                  Lolotte!\nLolotte!                   Shiver,\nSanglote,                  Sob,\nJacquot!”                  Jacquot!”\n\n\nShe had hardly finished this couplet, when she exclaimed:—\n\n“Do you ever go to the play, Monsieur Marius? I do. I have a little\nbrother who is a friend of the artists, and who gives me tickets\nsometimes. But I don’t like the benches in the galleries. One is\ncramped and uncomfortable there. There are rough people there\nsometimes; and people who smell bad.”\n\n\nThen she scrutinized Marius, assumed a singular air and said:—\n\n“Do you know, Mr. Marius, that you are a very handsome fellow?”\n\n\nAnd at the same moment the same idea occurred to them both, and made\nher smile and him blush. She stepped up to him, and laid her hand on\nhis shoulder: “You pay no heed to me, but I know you, Mr. Marius. I\nmeet you here on the staircase, and then I often see you going to a\nperson named Father Mabeuf who lives in the direction of Austerlitz,\nsometimes when I have been strolling in that quarter. It is very\nbecoming to you to have your hair tumbled thus.”\n\n\nShe tried to render her voice soft, but only succeeded in making it\nvery deep. A portion of her words was lost in the transit from her\nlarynx to her lips, as though on a piano where some notes are missing.\n\nMarius had retreated gently.\n\n“Mademoiselle,” said he, with his cool gravity, “I have here a package\nwhich belongs to you, I think. Permit me to return it to you.”\n\n\nAnd he held out the envelope containing the four letters.\n\nShe clapped her hands and exclaimed:—\n\n“We have been looking everywhere for that!”\n\n\nThen she eagerly seized the package and opened the envelope, saying as\nshe did so:—\n\n“Dieu de Dieu! how my sister and I have hunted! And it was you who\nfound it! On the boulevard, was it not? It must have been on the\nboulevard? You see, we let it fall when we were running. It was that\nbrat of a sister of mine who was so stupid. When we got home, we could\nnot find it anywhere. As we did not wish to be beaten, as that is\nuseless, as that is entirely useless, as that is absolutely useless, we\nsaid that we had carried the letters to the proper persons, and that\nthey had said to us: ‘Nix.’ So here they are, those poor letters! And\nhow did you find out that they belonged to me? Ah! yes, the writing. So\nit was you that we jostled as we passed last night. We couldn’t see. I\nsaid to my sister: ‘Is it a gentleman?’ My sister said to me: ‘I think\nit is a gentleman.’”\n\n\nIn the meanwhile she had unfolded the petition addressed to “the\nbenevolent gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas.”\n\n\n“Here!” said she, “this is for that old fellow who goes to mass. By the\nway, this is his hour. I’ll go and carry it to him. Perhaps he will\ngive us something to breakfast on.”\n\n\nThen she began to laugh again, and added:—\n\n“Do you know what it will mean if we get a breakfast today? It will\nmean that we shall have had our breakfast of the day before yesterday,\nour breakfast of yesterday, our dinner of to-day, and all that at once,\nand this morning. Come! Parbleu! if you are not satisfied, dogs,\nburst!”\n\n\nThis reminded Marius of the wretched girl’s errand to himself. He\nfumbled in his waistcoat pocket, and found nothing there.\n\nThe young girl went on, and seemed to have no consciousness of Marius’\npresence.\n\n“I often go off in the evening. Sometimes I don’t come home again. Last\nwinter, before we came here, we lived under the arches of the bridges.\nWe huddled together to keep from freezing. My little sister cried. How\nmelancholy the water is! When I thought of drowning myself, I said to\nmyself: ‘No, it’s too cold.’ I go out alone, whenever I choose, I\nsometimes sleep in the ditches. Do you know, at night, when I walk\nalong the boulevard, I see the trees like forks, I see houses, all\nblack and as big as Notre Dame, I fancy that the white walls are the\nriver, I say to myself: ‘Why, there’s water there!’ The stars are like\nthe lamps in illuminations, one would say that they smoked and that the\nwind blew them out, I am bewildered, as though horses were breathing in\nmy ears; although it is night, I hear hand-organs and\nspinning-machines, and I don’t know what all. I think people are\nflinging stones at me, I flee without knowing whither, everything\nwhirls and whirls. You feel very queer when you have had no food.”\n\n\nAnd then she stared at him with a bewildered air.\n\nBy dint of searching and ransacking his pockets, Marius had finally\ncollected five francs sixteen sous. This was all he owned in the world\nfor the moment. “At all events,” he thought, “there is my dinner for\nto-day, and to-morrow we will see.” He kept the sixteen sous, and\nhanded the five francs to the young girl.\n\nShe seized the coin.\n\n“Good!” said she, “the sun is shining!”\n\n\nAnd, as though the sun had possessed the property of melting the\navalanches of slang in her brain, she went on:—\n\n“Five francs! the shiner! a monarch! in this hole! Ain’t this fine!\nYou’re a jolly thief! I’m your humble servant! Bravo for the good\nfellows! Two days’ wine! and meat! and stew! we’ll have a royal feast!\nand a good fill!”\n\n\nShe pulled her chemise up on her shoulders, made a low bow to Marius,\nthen a familiar sign with her hand, and went towards the door, saying:—\n\n“Good morning, sir. It’s all right. I’ll go and find my old man.”\n\n\nAs she passed, she caught sight of a dry crust of bread on the commode,\nwhich was moulding there amid the dust; she flung herself upon it and\nbit into it, muttering:—\n\n“That’s good! it’s hard! it breaks my teeth!”\n\n\nThen she departed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—A PROVIDENTIAL PEEP-HOLE\n\n\nMarius had lived for five years in poverty, in destitution, even in\ndistress, but he now perceived that he had not known real misery. True\nmisery he had but just had a view of. It was its spectre which had just\npassed before his eyes. In fact, he who has only beheld the misery of\nman has seen nothing; the misery of woman is what he must see; he who\nhas seen only the misery of woman has seen nothing; he must see the\nmisery of the child.\n\nWhen a man has reached his last extremity, he has reached his last\nresources at the same time. Woe to the defenceless beings who surround\nhim! Work, wages, bread, fire, courage, good will, all fail him\nsimultaneously. The light of day seems extinguished without, the moral\nlight within; in these shadows man encounters the feebleness of the\nwoman and the child, and bends them violently to ignominy.\n\nThen all horrors become possible. Despair is surrounded with fragile\npartitions which all open on either vice or crime.\n\nHealth, youth, honor, all the shy delicacies of the young body, the\nheart, virginity, modesty, that epidermis of the soul, are manipulated\nin sinister wise by that fumbling which seeks resources, which\nencounters opprobrium, and which accommodates itself to it. Fathers,\nmothers, children, brothers, sisters, men, women, daughters, adhere and\nbecome incorporated, almost like a mineral formation, in that dusky\npromiscuousness of sexes, relationships, ages, infamies, and\ninnocences. They crouch, back to back, in a sort of hut of fate. They\nexchange woe-begone glances. Oh, the unfortunate wretches! How pale\nthey are! How cold they are! It seems as though they dwelt in a planet\nmuch further from the sun than ours.\n\nThis young girl was to Marius a sort of messenger from the realm of sad\nshadows. She revealed to him a hideous side of the night.\n\nMarius almost reproached himself for the preoccupations of reverie and\npassion which had prevented his bestowing a glance on his neighbors up\nto that day. The payment of their rent had been a mechanical movement,\nwhich any one would have yielded to; but he, Marius, should have done\nbetter than that. What! only a wall separated him from those abandoned\nbeings who lived gropingly in the dark outside the pale of the rest of\nthe world, he was elbow to elbow with them, he was, in some sort, the\nlast link of the human race which they touched, he heard them live, or\nrather, rattle in the death agony beside him, and he paid no heed to\nthem! Every day, every instant, he heard them walking on the other side\nof the wall, he heard them go, and come, and speak, and he did not even\nlend an ear! And groans lay in those words, and he did not even listen\nto them, his thoughts were elsewhere, given up to dreams, to impossible\nradiances, to loves in the air, to follies; and all the while, human\ncreatures, his brothers in Jesus Christ, his brothers in the people,\nwere agonizing in vain beside him! He even formed a part of their\nmisfortune, and he aggravated it. For if they had had another neighbor\nwho was less chimerical and more attentive, any ordinary and charitable\nman, evidently their indigence would have been noticed, their signals\nof distress would have been perceived, and they would have been taken\nhold of and rescued! They appeared very corrupt and very depraved, no\ndoubt, very vile, very odious even; but those who fall without becoming\ndegraded are rare; besides, there is a point where the unfortunate and\nthe infamous unite and are confounded in a single word, a fatal word,\n_the miserable_; whose fault is this? And then should not the charity\nbe all the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great?\n\nWhile reading himself this moral lesson, for there were occasions on\nwhich Marius, like all truly honest hearts, was his own pedagogue and\nscolded himself more than he deserved, he stared at the wall which\nseparated him from the Jondrettes, as though he were able to make his\ngaze, full of pity, penetrate that partition and warm these wretched\npeople. The wall was a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and\nbeams, and, as the reader had just learned, it allowed the sound of\nvoices and words to be clearly distinguished. Only a man as dreamy as\nMarius could have failed to perceive this long before. There was no\npaper pasted on the wall, either on the side of the Jondrettes or on\nthat of Marius; the coarse construction was visible in its nakedness.\nMarius examined the partition, almost unconsciously; sometimes reverie\nexamines, observes, and scrutinizes as thought would. All at once he\nsprang up; he had just perceived, near the top, close to the ceiling, a\ntriangular hole, which resulted from the space between three lathes.\nThe plaster which should have filled this cavity was missing, and by\nmounting on the commode, a view could be had through this aperture into\nthe Jondrettes’ attic. Commiseration has, and should have, its\ncuriosity. This aperture formed a sort of peep-hole. It is permissible\nto gaze at misfortune like a traitor in order to succor it.27\n\n“Let us get some little idea of what these people are like,” thought\nMarius, “and in what condition they are.”\n\n\nHe climbed upon the commode, put his eye to the crevice, and looked.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—THE WILD MAN IN HIS LAIR\n\n\nCities, like forests, have their caverns in which all the most wicked\nand formidable creatures which they contain conceal themselves. Only,\nin cities, that which thus conceals itself is ferocious, unclean, and\npetty, that is to say, ugly; in forests, that which conceals itself is\nferocious, savage, and grand, that is to say, beautiful. Taking one\nlair with another, the beast’s is preferable to the man’s. Caverns are\nbetter than hovels.\n\nWhat Marius now beheld was a hovel.\n\nMarius was poor, and his chamber was poverty-stricken, but as his\npoverty was noble, his garret was neat. The den upon which his eye now\nrested was abject, dirty, fetid, pestiferous, mean, sordid. The only\nfurniture consisted of a straw chair, an infirm table, some old bits of\ncrockery, and in two of the corners, two indescribable pallets; all the\nlight was furnished by a dormer window of four panes, draped with\nspiders’ webs. Through this aperture there penetrated just enough light\nto make the face of a man appear like the face of a phantom. The walls\nhad a leprous aspect, and were covered with seams and scars, like a\nvisage disfigured by some horrible malady; a repulsive moisture exuded\nfrom them. Obscene sketches roughly sketched with charcoal could be\ndistinguished upon them.\n\nThe chamber which Marius occupied had a dilapidated brick pavement;\nthis one was neither tiled nor planked; its inhabitants stepped\ndirectly on the antique plaster of the hovel, which had grown black\nunder the long-continued pressure of feet. Upon this uneven floor,\nwhere the dirt seemed to be fairly incrusted, and which possessed but\none virginity, that of the broom, were capriciously grouped\nconstellations of old shoes, socks, and repulsive rags; however, this\nroom had a fireplace, so it was let for forty francs a year. There was\nevery sort of thing in that fireplace, a brazier, a pot, broken boards,\nrags suspended from nails, a bird-cage, ashes, and even a little fire.\nTwo brands were smouldering there in a melancholy way.\n\nOne thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was,\nthat it was large. It had projections and angles and black holes, the\nlower sides of roofs, bays, and promontories. Hence horrible,\nunfathomable nooks where it seemed as though spiders as big as one’s\nfist, wood-lice as large as one’s foot, and perhaps even—who\nknows?—some monstrous human beings, must be hiding.\n\nOne of the pallets was near the door, the other near the window. One\nend of each touched the fireplace and faced Marius. In a corner near\nthe aperture through which Marius was gazing, a colored engraving in a\nblack frame was suspended to a nail on the wall, and at its bottom, in\nlarge letters, was the inscription: THE DREAM. This represented a\nsleeping woman, and a child, also asleep, the child on the woman’s lap,\nan eagle in a cloud, with a crown in his beak, and the woman thrusting\nthe crown away from the child’s head, without awaking the latter; in\nthe background, Napoleon in a glory, leaning on a very blue column with\na yellow capital ornamented with this inscription:\n\nMARINGO\nAUSTERLITS\nIENA\nWAGRAMME\nELOT\n\n\nBeneath this frame, a sort of wooden panel, which was no longer than it\nwas broad, stood on the ground and rested in a sloping attitude against\nthe wall. It had the appearance of a picture with its face turned to\nthe wall, of a frame probably showing a daub on the other side, of some\npier-glass detached from a wall and lying forgotten there while waiting\nto be rehung.\n\nNear the table, upon which Marius descried a pen, ink, and paper, sat a\nman about sixty years of age, small, thin, livid, haggard, with a\ncunning, cruel, and uneasy air; a hideous scoundrel.\n\nIf Lavater had studied this visage, he would have found the vulture\nmingled with the attorney there, the bird of prey and the pettifogger\nrendering each other mutually hideous and complementing each other; the\npettifogger making the bird of prey ignoble, the bird of prey making\nthe pettifogger horrible.\n\nThis man had a long gray beard. He was clad in a woman’s chemise, which\nallowed his hairy breast and his bare arms, bristling with gray hair,\nto be seen. Beneath this chemise, muddy trousers and boots through\nwhich his toes projected were visible.\n\nHe had a pipe in his mouth and was smoking. There was no bread in the\nhovel, but there was still tobacco.\n\nHe was writing probably some more letters like those which Marius had\nread.\n\nOn the corner of the table lay an ancient, dilapidated, reddish volume,\nand the size, which was the antique 12mo of reading-rooms, betrayed a\nromance. On the cover sprawled the following title, printed in large\ncapitals: GOD; THE KING; HONOR AND THE LADIES; BY DUCRAY DUMINIL, 1814.\n\nAs the man wrote, he talked aloud, and Marius heard his words:—\n\n“The idea that there is no equality, even when you are dead! Just look\nat Père-Lachaise! The great, those who are rich, are up above, in the\nacacia alley, which is paved. They can reach it in a carriage. The\nlittle people, the poor, the unhappy, well, what of them? they are put\ndown below, where the mud is up to your knees, in the damp places. They\nare put there so that they will decay the sooner! You cannot go to see\nthem without sinking into the earth.”\n\n\nHe paused, smote the table with his fist, and added, as he ground his\nteeth:—\n\n“Oh! I could eat the whole world!”\n\n\nA big woman, who might be forty years of age, or a hundred, was\ncrouching near the fireplace on her bare heels.\n\nShe, too, was clad only in a chemise and a knitted petticoat patched\nwith bits of old cloth. A coarse linen apron concealed the half of her\npetticoat. Although this woman was doubled up and bent together, it\ncould be seen that she was of very lofty stature. She was a sort of\ngiant, beside her husband. She had hideous hair, of a reddish blond\nwhich was turning gray, and which she thrust back from time to time,\nwith her enormous shining hands, with their flat nails.\n\nBeside her, on the floor, wide open, lay a book of the same form as the\nother, and probably a volume of the same romance.\n\nOn one of the pallets, Marius caught a glimpse of a sort of tall pale\nyoung girl, who sat there half naked and with pendant feet, and who did\nnot seem to be listening or seeing or living.\n\nNo doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his room.\n\nShe seemed to be eleven or twelve years of age. On closer scrutiny it\nwas evident that she really was fourteen. She was the child who had\nsaid, on the boulevard the evening before: “I bolted, bolted, bolted!”\n\n\nShe was of that puny sort which remains backward for a long time, then\nsuddenly starts up rapidly. It is indigence which produces these\nmelancholy human plants. These creatures have neither childhood nor\nyouth. At fifteen years of age they appear to be twelve, at sixteen\nthey seem twenty. To-day a little girl, to-morrow a woman. One might\nsay that they stride through life, in order to get through with it the\nmore speedily.\n\nAt this moment, this being had the air of a child.\n\nMoreover, no trace of work was revealed in that dwelling; no\nhandicraft, no spinning-wheel, not a tool. In one corner lay some\nironmongery of dubious aspect. It was the dull listlessness which\nfollows despair and precedes the death agony.\n\nMarius gazed for a while at this gloomy interior, more terrifying than\nthe interior of a tomb, for the human soul could be felt fluttering\nthere, and life was palpitating there. The garret, the cellar, the\nlowly ditch where certain indigent wretches crawl at the very bottom of\nthe social edifice, is not exactly the sepulchre, but only its\nantechamber; but, as the wealthy display their greatest magnificence at\nthe entrance of their palaces, it seems that death, which stands\ndirectly side by side with them, places its greatest miseries in that\nvestibule.\n\nThe man held his peace, the woman spoke no word, the young girl did not\neven seem to breathe. The scratching of the pen on the paper was\naudible.\n\nThe man grumbled, without pausing in his writing. “Canaille! canaille!\neverybody is canaille!”\n\n\nThis variation to Solomon’s exclamation elicited a sigh from the woman.\n\n“Calm yourself, my little friend,” she said. “Don’t hurt yourself, my\ndear. You are too good to write to all those people, husband.”\n\n\nBodies press close to each other in misery, as in cold, but hearts draw\napart. This woman must have loved this man, to all appearance, judging\nfrom the amount of love within her; but probably, in the daily and\nreciprocal reproaches of the horrible distress which weighed on the\nwhole group, this had become extinct. There no longer existed in her\nanything more than the ashes of affection for her husband.\nNevertheless, caressing appellations had survived, as is often the\ncase. She called him: _My dear, my little friend, my good man_, etc.,\nwith her mouth while her heart was silent.\n\nThe man resumed his writing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—STRATEGY AND TACTICS\n\n\nMarius, with a load upon his breast, was on the point of descending\nfrom the species of observatory which he had improvised, when a sound\nattracted his attention and caused him to remain at his post.\n\nThe door of the attic had just burst open abruptly. The eldest girl\nmade her appearance on the threshold. On her feet, she had large,\ncoarse, men’s shoes, bespattered with mud, which had splashed even to\nher red ankles, and she was wrapped in an old mantle which hung in\ntatters. Marius had not seen it on her an hour previously, but she had\nprobably deposited it at his door, in order that she might inspire the\nmore pity, and had picked it up again on emerging. She entered, pushed\nthe door to behind her, paused to take breath, for she was completely\nbreathless, then exclaimed with an expression of triumph and joy:—\n\n“He is coming!”\n\n\nThe father turned his eyes towards her, the woman turned her head, the\nlittle sister did not stir.\n\n“Who?” demanded her father.\n\n“The gentleman!”\n\n\n“The philanthropist?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“From the church of Saint-Jacques?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“That old fellow?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“And he is coming?”\n\n\n“He is following me.”\n\n\n“You are sure?”\n\n\n“I am sure.”\n\n\n“There, truly, he is coming?”\n\n\n“He is coming in a fiacre.”\n\n\n“In a fiacre. He is Rothschild.”\n\n\nThe father rose.\n\n“How are you sure? If he is coming in a fiacre, how is it that you\narrive before him? You gave him our address at least? Did you tell him\nthat it was the last door at the end of the corridor, on the right? If\nhe only does not make a mistake! So you found him at the church? Did he\nread my letter? What did he say to you?”\n\n\n“Ta, ta, ta,” said the girl, “how you do gallop on, my good man! See\nhere: I entered the church, he was in his usual place, I made him a\nreverence, and I handed him the letter; he read it and said to me:\n‘Where do you live, my child?’ I said: ‘Monsieur, I will show you.’ He\nsaid to me: ‘No, give me your address, my daughter has some purchases\nto make, I will take a carriage and reach your house at the same time\nthat you do.’ I gave him the address. When I mentioned the house, he\nseemed surprised and hesitated for an instant, then he said: ‘Never\nmind, I will come.’ When the mass was finished, I watched him leave the\nchurch with his daughter, and I saw them enter a carriage. I certainly\ndid tell him the last door in the corridor, on the right.”\n\n\n“And what makes you think that he will come?”\n\n\n“I have just seen the fiacre turn into the Rue Petit-Banquier. That is\nwhat made me run so.”\n\n\n“How do you know that it was the same fiacre?”\n\n\n“Because I took notice of the number, so there!”\n\n\n“What was the number?”\n\n\n“440.”\n\n\n“Good, you are a clever girl.”\n\n\nThe girl stared boldly at her father, and showing the shoes which she\nhad on her feet:—\n\n“A clever girl, possibly; but I tell you I won’t put these shoes on\nagain, and that I won’t, for the sake of my health, in the first place,\nand for the sake of cleanliness, in the next. I don’t know anything\nmore irritating than shoes that squelch, and go _ghi, ghi, ghi,_ the\nwhole time. I prefer to go barefoot.”\n\n\n“You are right,” said her father, in a sweet tone which contrasted with\nthe young girl’s rudeness, “but then, you will not be allowed to enter\nchurches, for poor people must have shoes to do that. One cannot go\nbarefoot to the good God,” he added bitterly.\n\nThen, returning to the subject which absorbed him:—\n\n“So you are sure that he will come?”\n\n\n“He is following on my heels,” said she.\n\nThe man started up. A sort of illumination appeared on his countenance.\n\n“Wife!” he exclaimed, “you hear. Here is the philanthropist. Extinguish\nthe fire.”\n\n\nThe stupefied mother did not stir.\n\nThe father, with the agility of an acrobat, seized a broken-nosed jug\nwhich stood on the chimney, and flung the water on the brands.\n\nThen, addressing his eldest daughter:—\n\n“Here you! Pull the straw off that chair!”\n\n\nHis daughter did not understand.\n\nHe seized the chair, and with one kick he rendered it seatless. His leg\npassed through it.\n\nAs he withdrew his leg, he asked his daughter:—\n\n“Is it cold?”\n\n\n“Very cold. It is snowing.”\n\n\nThe father turned towards the younger girl who sat on the bed near the\nwindow, and shouted to her in a thundering voice:—\n\n“Quick! get off that bed, you lazy thing! will you never do anything?\nBreak a pane of glass!”\n\n\nThe little girl jumped off the bed with a shiver.\n\n“Break a pane!” he repeated.\n\nThe child stood still in bewilderment.\n\n“Do you hear me?” repeated her father, “I tell you to break a pane!”\n\n\nThe child, with a sort of terrified obedience, rose on tiptoe, and\nstruck a pane with her fist. The glass broke and fell with a loud\nclatter.\n\n“Good,” said the father.\n\nHe was grave and abrupt. His glance swept rapidly over all the crannies\nof the garret. One would have said that he was a general making the\nfinal preparation at the moment when the battle is on the point of\nbeginning.\n\nThe mother, who had not said a word so far, now rose and demanded in a\ndull, slow, languid voice, whence her words seemed to emerge in a\ncongealed state:—\n\n“What do you mean to do, my dear?”\n\n\n“Get into bed,” replied the man.\n\nHis intonation admitted of no deliberation. The mother obeyed, and\nthrew herself heavily on one of the pallets.\n\nIn the meantime, a sob became audible in one corner.\n\n“What’s that?” cried the father.\n\nThe younger daughter exhibited her bleeding fist, without quitting the\ncorner in which she was cowering. She had wounded herself while\nbreaking the window; she went off, near her mother’s pallet and wept\nsilently.\n\nIt was now the mother’s turn to start up and exclaim:—\n\n“Just see there! What follies you commit! She has cut herself breaking\nthat pane for you!”\n\n\n“So much the better!” said the man. “I foresaw that.”\n\n\n“What? So much the better?” retorted his wife.\n\n“Peace!” replied the father, “I suppress the liberty of the press.”\n\n\nThen tearing the woman’s chemise which he was wearing, he made a strip\nof cloth with which he hastily swathed the little girl’s bleeding\nwrist.\n\nThat done, his eye fell with a satisfied expression on his torn\nchemise.\n\n“And the chemise too,” said he, “this has a good appearance.”\n\n\nAn icy breeze whistled through the window and entered the room. The\nouter mist penetrated thither and diffused itself like a whitish sheet\nof wadding vaguely spread by invisible fingers. Through the broken pane\nthe snow could be seen falling. The snow promised by the Candlemas sun\nof the preceding day had actually come.\n\nThe father cast a glance about him as though to make sure that he had\nforgotten nothing. He seized an old shovel and spread ashes over the\nwet brands in such a manner as to entirely conceal them.\n\nThen drawing himself up and leaning against the chimney-piece:—\n\n“Now,” said he, “we can receive the philanthropist.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—THE RAY OF LIGHT IN THE HOVEL\n\n\nThe big girl approached and laid her hand in her father’s.\n\n“Feel how cold I am,” said she.\n\n“Bah!” replied the father, “I am much colder than that.”\n\n\nThe mother exclaimed impetuously:—\n\n“You always have something better than any one else, so you do! even\nbad things.”\n\n\n“Down with you!” said the man.\n\nThe mother, being eyed after a certain fashion, held her tongue.\n\nSilence reigned for a moment in the hovel. The elder girl was removing\nthe mud from the bottom of her mantle, with a careless air; her younger\nsister continued to sob; the mother had taken the latter’s head between\nher hands, and was covering it with kisses, whispering to her the\nwhile:—\n\n“My treasure, I entreat you, it is nothing of consequence, don’t cry,\nyou will anger your father.”\n\n\n“No!” exclaimed the father, “quite the contrary! sob! sob! that’s\nright.”\n\n\nThen turning to the elder:—\n\n“There now! He is not coming! What if he were not to come! I shall have\nextinguished my fire, wrecked my chair, torn my shirt, and broken my\npane all for nothing.”\n\n\n“And wounded the child!” murmured the mother.\n\n“Do you know,” went on the father, “that it’s beastly cold in this\ndevil’s garret! What if that man should not come! Oh! See there, you!\nHe makes us wait! He says to himself: ‘Well! they will wait for me!\nThat’s what they’re there for.’ Oh! how I hate them, and with what joy,\njubilation, enthusiasm, and satisfaction I could strangle all those\nrich folks! all those rich folks! These men who pretend to be\ncharitable, who put on airs, who go to mass, who make presents to the\npriesthood, _preachy, preachy_, in their skullcaps, and who think\nthemselves above us, and who come for the purpose of humiliating us,\nand to bring us ‘clothes,’ as they say! old duds that are not worth\nfour sous! And bread! That’s not what I want, pack of rascals that they\nare, it’s money! Ah! money! Never! Because they say that we would go\noff and drink it up, and that we are drunkards and idlers! And they!\nWhat are they, then, and what have they been in their time! Thieves!\nThey never could have become rich otherwise! Oh! Society ought to be\ngrasped by the four corners of the cloth and tossed into the air, all\nof it! It would all be smashed, very likely, but at least, no one would\nhave anything, and there would be that much gained! But what is that\nblockhead of a benevolent gentleman doing? Will he come? Perhaps the\nanimal has forgotten the address! I’ll bet that that old beast—”\n\n\nAt that moment there came a light tap at the door, the man rushed to it\nand opened it, exclaiming, amid profound bows and smiles of adoration:—\n\n“Enter, sir! Deign to enter, most respected benefactor, and your\ncharming young lady, also.”\n\n\nA man of ripe age and a young girl made their appearance on the\nthreshold of the attic.\n\nMarius had not quitted his post. His feelings for the moment surpassed\nthe powers of the human tongue.\n\nIt was She!\n\nWhoever has loved knows all the radiant meanings contained in those\nthree letters of that word: She.\n\nIt was certainly she. Marius could hardly distinguish her through the\nluminous vapor which had suddenly spread before his eyes. It was that\nsweet, absent being, that star which had beamed upon him for six\nmonths; it was those eyes, that brow, that mouth, that lovely vanished\nface which had created night by its departure. The vision had been\neclipsed, now it reappeared.\n\nIt reappeared in that gloom, in that garret, in that misshapen attic,\nin all that horror.\n\nMarius shuddered in dismay. What! It was she! The palpitations of his\nheart troubled his sight. He felt that he was on the brink of bursting\ninto tears! What! He beheld her again at last, after having sought her\nso long! It seemed to him that he had lost his soul, and that he had\njust found it again.\n\nShe was the same as ever, only a little pale; her delicate face was\nframed in a bonnet of violet velvet, her figure was concealed beneath a\npelisse of black satin. Beneath her long dress, a glimpse could be\ncaught of her tiny foot shod in a silken boot.\n\nShe was still accompanied by M. Leblanc.\n\nShe had taken a few steps into the room, and had deposited a tolerably\nbulky parcel on the table.\n\nThe eldest Jondrette girl had retired behind the door, and was staring\nwith sombre eyes at that velvet bonnet, that silk mantle, and that\ncharming, happy face.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—JONDRETTE COMES NEAR WEEPING\n\n\nThe hovel was so dark, that people coming from without felt on entering\nit the effect produced on entering a cellar. The two newcomers\nadvanced, therefore, with a certain hesitation, being hardly able to\ndistinguish the vague forms surrounding them, while they could be\nclearly seen and scrutinized by the eyes of the inhabitants of the\ngarret, who were accustomed to this twilight.\n\nM. Leblanc approached, with his sad but kindly look, and said to\nJondrette the father:—\n\n“Monsieur, in this package you will find some new clothes and some\nwoollen stockings and blankets.”\n\n\n“Our angelic benefactor overwhelms us,” said Jondrette, bowing to the\nvery earth.\n\nThen, bending down to the ear of his eldest daughter, while the two\nvisitors were engaged in examining this lamentable interior, he added\nin a low and rapid voice:—\n\n“Hey? What did I say? Duds! No money! They are all alike! By the way,\nhow was the letter to that old blockhead signed?”\n\n\n“Fabantou,” replied the girl.\n\n“The dramatic artist, good!”\n\n\nIt was lucky for Jondrette, that this had occurred to him, for at the\nvery moment, M. Leblanc turned to him, and said to him with the air of\na person who is seeking to recall a name:—\n\n“I see that you are greatly to be pitied, Monsieur—”\n\n\n“Fabantou,” replied Jondrette quickly.\n\n“Monsieur Fabantou, yes, that is it. I remember.”\n\n\n“Dramatic artist, sir, and one who has had some success.”\n\n\nHere Jondrette evidently judged the moment propitious for capturing the\n“philanthropist.” He exclaimed with an accent which smacked at the same\ntime of the vainglory of the mountebank at fairs, and the humility of\nthe mendicant on the highway:—\n\n“A pupil of Talma! Sir! I am a pupil of Talma! Fortune formerly smiled\non me—Alas! Now it is misfortune’s turn. You see, my benefactor, no\nbread, no fire. My poor babes have no fire! My only chair has no seat!\nA broken pane! And in such weather! My spouse in bed! Ill!”\n\n\n“Poor woman!” said M. Leblanc.\n\n“My child wounded!” added Jondrette.\n\nThe child, diverted by the arrival of the strangers, had fallen to\ncontemplating “the young lady,” and had ceased to sob.\n\n“Cry! bawl!” said Jondrette to her in a low voice.\n\nAt the same time he pinched her sore hand. All this was done with the\ntalent of a juggler.\n\nThe little girl gave vent to loud shrieks.\n\nThe adorable young girl, whom Marius, in his heart, called “his\nUrsule,” approached her hastily.\n\n“Poor, dear child!” said she.\n\n“You see, my beautiful young lady,” pursued Jondrette “her bleeding\nwrist! It came through an accident while working at a machine to earn\nsix sous a day. It may be necessary to cut off her arm.”\n\n\n“Really?” said the old gentleman, in alarm.\n\nThe little girl, taking this seriously, fell to sobbing more violently\nthan ever.\n\n“Alas! yes, my benefactor!” replied the father.\n\nFor several minutes, Jondrette had been scrutinizing “the benefactor”\nin a singular fashion. As he spoke, he seemed to be examining the other\nattentively, as though seeking to summon up his recollections. All at\nonce, profiting by a moment when the newcomers were questioning the\nchild with interest as to her injured hand, he passed near his wife,\nwho lay in her bed with a stupid and dejected air, and said to her in a\nrapid but very low tone:—\n\n“Take a look at that man!”\n\n\nThen, turning to M. Leblanc, and continuing his lamentations:—\n\n“You see, sir! All the clothing that I have is my wife’s chemise! And\nall torn at that! In the depths of winter! I can’t go out for lack of a\ncoat. If I had a coat of any sort, I would go and see Mademoiselle\nMars, who knows me and is very fond of me. Does she not still reside in\nthe Rue de la Tour-des-Dames? Do you know, sir? We played together in\nthe provinces. I shared her laurels. Célimène would come to my succor,\nsir! Elmire would bestow alms on Bélisaire! But no, nothing! And not a\nsou in the house! My wife ill, and not a sou! My daughter dangerously\ninjured, not a sou! My wife suffers from fits of suffocation. It comes\nfrom her age, and besides, her nervous system is affected. She ought to\nhave assistance, and my daughter also! But the doctor! But the\napothecary! How am I to pay them? I would kneel to a penny, sir! Such\nis the condition to which the arts are reduced. And do you know, my\ncharming young lady, and you, my generous protector, do you know, you\nwho breathe forth virtue and goodness, and who perfume that church\nwhere my daughter sees you every day when she says her prayers?—For I\nhave brought up my children religiously, sir. I did not want them to\ntake to the theatre. Ah! the hussies! If I catch them tripping! I do\nnot jest, that I don’t! I read them lessons on honor, on morality, on\nvirtue! Ask them! They have got to walk straight. They are none of your\nunhappy wretches who begin by having no family, and end by espousing\nthe public. One is Mamselle Nobody, and one becomes Madame Everybody.\nDeuce take it! None of that in the Fabantou family! I mean to bring\nthem up virtuously, and they shall be honest, and nice, and believe in\nGod, by the sacred name! Well, sir, my worthy sir, do you know what is\ngoing to happen to-morrow? To-morrow is the fourth day of February, the\nfatal day, the last day of grace allowed me by my landlord; if by this\nevening I have not paid my rent, to-morrow my oldest daughter, my\nspouse with her fever, my child with her wound,—we shall all four be\nturned out of here and thrown into the street, on the boulevard,\nwithout shelter, in the rain, in the snow. There, sir. I owe for four\nquarters—a whole year! that is to say, sixty francs.”\n\n\nJondrette lied. Four quarters would have amounted to only forty francs,\nand he could not owe four, because six months had not elapsed since\nMarius had paid for two.\n\nM. Leblanc drew five francs from his pocket and threw them on the\ntable.\n\nJondrette found time to mutter in the ear of his eldest daughter:—\n\n“The scoundrel! What does he think I can do with his five francs? That\nwon’t pay me for my chair and pane of glass! That’s what comes of\nincurring expenses!”\n\n\nIn the meanwhile, M. Leblanc had removed the large brown great-coat\nwhich he wore over his blue coat, and had thrown it over the back of\nthe chair.\n\n“Monsieur Fabantou,” he said, “these five francs are all that I have\nabout me, but I shall now take my daughter home, and I will return this\nevening,—it is this evening that you must pay, is it not?”\n\n\nJondrette’s face lighted up with a strange expression. He replied\nvivaciously:—\n\n“Yes, respected sir. At eight o’clock, I must be at my landlord’s.”\n\n\n“I will be here at six, and I will fetch you the sixty francs.”\n\n\n“My benefactor!” exclaimed Jondrette, overwhelmed. And he added, in a\nlow tone: “Take a good look at him, wife!”\n\n\nM. Leblanc had taken the arm of the young girl, once more, and had\nturned towards the door.\n\n“Farewell until this evening, my friends!” said he.\n\n“Six o’clock?” said Jondrette.\n\n“Six o’clock precisely.”\n\n\nAt that moment, the overcoat lying on the chair caught the eye of the\nelder Jondrette girl.\n\n“You are forgetting your coat, sir,” said she.\n\nJondrette darted an annihilating look at his daughter, accompanied by a\nformidable shrug of the shoulders.\n\nM. Leblanc turned back and said, with a smile:—\n\n“I have not forgotten it, I am leaving it.”\n\n\n“O my protector!” said Jondrette, “my august benefactor, I melt into\ntears! Permit me to accompany you to your carriage.”\n\n\n“If you come out,” answered M. Leblanc, “put on this coat. It really is\nvery cold.”\n\n\nJondrette did not need to be told twice. He hastily donned the brown\ngreat-coat. And all three went out, Jondrette preceding the two\nstrangers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X—TARIFF OF LICENSED CABS: TWO FRANCS AN HOUR\n\n\nMarius had lost nothing of this entire scene, and yet, in reality, had\nseen nothing. His eyes had remained fixed on the young girl, his heart\nhad, so to speak, seized her and wholly enveloped her from the moment\nof her very first step in that garret. During her entire stay there, he\nhad lived that life of ecstasy which suspends material perceptions and\nprecipitates the whole soul on a single point. He contemplated, not\nthat girl, but that light which wore a satin pelisse and a velvet\nbonnet. The star Sirius might have entered the room, and he would not\nhave been any more dazzled.\n\nWhile the young girl was engaged in opening the package, unfolding the\nclothing and the blankets, questioning the sick mother kindly, and the\nlittle injured girl tenderly, he watched her every movement, he sought\nto catch her words. He knew her eyes, her brow, her beauty, her form,\nher walk, he did not know the sound of her voice. He had once fancied\nthat he had caught a few words at the Luxembourg, but he was not\nabsolutely sure of the fact. He would have given ten years of his life\nto hear it, in order that he might bear away in his soul a little of\nthat music. But everything was drowned in the lamentable exclamations\nand trumpet bursts of Jondrette. This added a touch of genuine wrath to\nMarius’ ecstasy. He devoured her with his eyes. He could not believe\nthat it really was that divine creature whom he saw in the midst of\nthose vile creatures in that monstrous lair. It seemed to him that he\nbeheld a humming-bird in the midst of toads.\n\nWhen she took her departure, he had but one thought, to follow her, to\ncling to her trace, not to quit her until he learned where she lived,\nnot to lose her again, at least, after having so miraculously\nre-discovered her. He leaped down from the commode and seized his hat.\nAs he laid his hand on the lock of the door, and was on the point of\nopening it, a sudden reflection caused him to pause. The corridor was\nlong, the staircase steep, Jondrette was talkative, M. Leblanc had, no\ndoubt, not yet regained his carriage; if, on turning round in the\ncorridor, or on the staircase, he were to catch sight of him, Marius,\nin that house, he would, evidently, take the alarm, and find means to\nescape from him again, and this time it would be final. What was he to\ndo? Should he wait a little? But while he was waiting, the carriage\nmight drive off. Marius was perplexed. At last he accepted the risk and\nquitted his room.\n\nThere was no one in the corridor. He hastened to the stairs. There was\nno one on the staircase. He descended in all haste, and reached the\nboulevard in time to see a fiacre turning the corner of the Rue du\nPetit-Banquier, on its way back to Paris.\n\nMarius rushed headlong in that direction. On arriving at the angle of\nthe boulevard, he caught sight of the fiacre again, rapidly descending\nthe Rue Mouffetard; the carriage was already a long way off, and there\nwas no means of overtaking it; what! run after it? Impossible; and\nbesides, the people in the carriage would assuredly notice an\nindividual running at full speed in pursuit of a fiacre, and the father\nwould recognize him. At that moment, wonderful and unprecedented good\nluck, Marius perceived an empty cab passing along the boulevard. There\nwas but one thing to be done, to jump into this cab and follow the\nfiacre. That was sure, efficacious, and free from danger.\n\nMarius made the driver a sign to halt, and called to him:—\n\n“By the hour?”\n\n\nMarius wore no cravat, he had on his working-coat, which was destitute\nof buttons, his shirt was torn along one of the plaits on the bosom.\n\nThe driver halted, winked, and held out his left hand to Marius,\nrubbing his forefinger gently with his thumb.\n\n“What is it?” said Marius.\n\n“Pay in advance,” said the coachman.\n\nMarius recollected that he had but sixteen sous about him.\n\n“How much?” he demanded.\n\n“Forty sous.”\n\n\n“I will pay on my return.”\n\n\nThe driver’s only reply was to whistle the air of La Palisse and to\nwhip up his horse.\n\nMarius stared at the retreating cabriolet with a bewildered air. For\nthe lack of four and twenty sous, he was losing his joy, his happiness,\nhis love! He had seen, and he was becoming blind again. He reflected\nbitterly, and it must be confessed, with profound regret, on the five\nfrancs which he had bestowed, that very morning, on that miserable\ngirl. If he had had those five francs, he would have been saved, he\nwould have been born again, he would have emerged from the limbo and\ndarkness, he would have made his escape from isolation and spleen, from\nhis widowed state; he might have re-knotted the black thread of his\ndestiny to that beautiful golden thread, which had just floated before\nhis eyes and had broken at the same instant, once more! He returned to\nhis hovel in despair.\n\nHe might have told himself that M. Leblanc had promised to return in\nthe evening, and that all he had to do was to set about the matter more\nskilfully, so that he might follow him on that occasion; but, in his\ncontemplation, it is doubtful whether he had heard this.\n\nAs he was on the point of mounting the staircase, he perceived, on the\nother side of the boulevard, near the deserted wall skirting the Rue De\nla Barrière-des-Gobelins, Jondrette, wrapped in the “philanthropist’s”\ngreat-coat, engaged in conversation with one of those men of\ndisquieting aspect who have been dubbed by common consent, _prowlers of\nthe barriers_; people of equivocal face, of suspicious monologues, who\npresent the air of having evil minds, and who generally sleep in the\ndaytime, which suggests the supposition that they work by night.\n\nThese two men, standing there motionless and in conversation, in the\nsnow which was falling in whirlwinds, formed a group that a policeman\nwould surely have observed, but which Marius hardly noticed.\n\nStill, in spite of his mournful preoccupation, he could not refrain\nfrom saying to himself that this prowler of the barriers with whom\nJondrette was talking resembled a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier,\nalias Bigrenaille, whom Courfeyrac had once pointed out to him as a\nvery dangerous nocturnal roamer. This man’s name the reader has learned\nin the preceding book. This Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias\nBigrenaille, figured later on in many criminal trials, and became a\nnotorious rascal. He was at that time only a famous rascal. To-day he\nexists in the state of tradition among ruffians and assassins. He was\nat the head of a school towards the end of the last reign. And in the\nevening, at nightfall, at the hour when groups form and talk in\nwhispers, he was discussed at La Force in the Fosse-aux-Lions. One\nmight even, in that prison, precisely at the spot where the sewer which\nserved the unprecedented escape, in broad daylight, of thirty\nprisoners, in 1843, passes under the culvert, read his name, PANCHAUD,\naudaciously carved by his own hand on the wall of the sewer, during one\nof his attempts at flight. In 1832, the police already had their eye on\nhim, but he had not as yet made a serious beginning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI—OFFERS OF SERVICE FROM MISERY TO WRETCHEDNESS\n\n\nMarius ascended the stairs of the hovel with slow steps; at the moment\nwhen he was about to re-enter his cell, he caught sight of the elder\nJondrette girl following him through the corridor. The very sight of\nthis girl was odious to him; it was she who had his five francs, it was\ntoo late to demand them back, the cab was no longer there, the fiacre\nwas far away. Moreover, she would not have given them back. As for\nquestioning her about the residence of the persons who had just been\nthere, that was useless; it was evident that she did not know, since\nthe letter signed Fabantou had been addressed “to the benevolent\ngentleman of the church of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas.”\n\n\nMarius entered his room and pushed the door to after him.\n\nIt did not close; he turned round and beheld a hand which held the door\nhalf open.\n\n“What is it?” he asked, “who is there?”\n\n\nIt was the Jondrette girl.\n\n“Is it you?” resumed Marius almost harshly, “still you! What do you\nwant with me?”\n\n\nShe appeared to be thoughtful and did not look at him. She no longer\nhad the air of assurance which had characterized her that morning. She\ndid not enter, but held back in the darkness of the corridor, where\nMarius could see her through the half-open door.\n\n“Come now, will you answer?” cried Marius. “What do you want with me?”\n\n\nShe raised her dull eyes, in which a sort of gleam seemed to flicker\nvaguely, and said:—\n\n“Monsieur Marius, you look sad. What is the matter with you?”\n\n\n“With me!” said Marius.\n\n“Yes, you.”\n\n\n“There is nothing the matter with me.”\n\n\n“Yes, there is!”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“I tell you there is!”\n\n\n“Let me alone!”\n\n\nMarius gave the door another push, but she retained her hold on it.\n\n“Stop,” said she, “you are in the wrong. Although you are not rich, you\nwere kind this morning. Be so again now. You gave me something to eat,\nnow tell me what ails you. You are grieved, that is plain. I do not\nwant you to be grieved. What can be done for it? Can I be of any\nservice? Employ me. I do not ask for your secrets, you need not tell\nthem to me, but I may be of use, nevertheless. I may be able to help\nyou, since I help my father. When it is necessary to carry letters, to\ngo to houses, to inquire from door to door, to find out an address, to\nfollow any one, I am of service. Well, you may assuredly tell me what\nis the matter with you, and I will go and speak to the persons;\nsometimes it is enough if some one speaks to the persons, that suffices\nto let them understand matters, and everything comes right. Make use of\nme.”\n\n\nAn idea flashed across Marius’ mind. What branch does one disdain when\none feels that one is falling?\n\nHe drew near to the Jondrette girl.\n\n“Listen—” he said to her.\n\nShe interrupted him with a gleam of joy in her eyes.\n\n“Oh yes, do call me _thou!_ I like that better.”\n\n\n“Well,” he resumed, “thou hast brought hither that old gentleman and\nhis daughter!”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Dost thou know their address?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“Find it for me.”\n\n\nThe Jondrette’s dull eyes had grown joyous, and they now became gloomy.\n\n“Is that what you want?” she demanded.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Do you know them?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“That is to say,” she resumed quickly, “you do not know her, but you\nwish to know her.”\n\n\nThis _them_ which had turned into _her_ had something indescribably\nsignificant and bitter about it.\n\n“Well, can you do it?” said Marius.\n\n“You shall have the beautiful lady’s address.”\n\n\nThere was still a shade in the words “the beautiful lady” which\ntroubled Marius. He resumed:—\n\n“Never mind, after all, the address of the father and daughter. Their\naddress, indeed!”\n\n\nShe gazed fixedly at him.\n\n“What will you give me?”\n\n\n“Anything you like.”\n\n\n“Anything I like?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“You shall have the address.”\n\n\nShe dropped her head; then, with a brusque movement, she pulled to the\ndoor, which closed behind her.\n\nMarius found himself alone.\n\nHe dropped into a chair, with his head and both elbows on his bed,\nabsorbed in thoughts which he could not grasp, and as though a prey to\nvertigo. All that had taken place since the morning, the appearance of\nthe angel, her disappearance, what that creature had just said to him,\na gleam of hope floating in an immense despair,—this was what filled\nhis brain confusedly.\n\nAll at once he was violently aroused from his reverie.\n\nHe heard the shrill, hard voice of Jondrette utter these words, which\nwere fraught with a strange interest for him:—\n\n“I tell you that I am sure of it, and that I recognized him.”\n\n\nOf whom was Jondrette speaking? Whom had he recognized? M. Leblanc? The\nfather of “his Ursule”? What! Did Jondrette know him? Was Marius about\nto obtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the information\nwithout which his life was so dark to him? Was he about to learn at\nlast who it was that he loved, who that young girl was? Who her father\nwas? Was the dense shadow which enwrapped them on the point of being\ndispelled? Was the veil about to be rent? Ah! Heavens!\n\nHe bounded rather than climbed upon his commode, and resumed his post\nnear the little peep-hole in the partition wall.\n\nAgain he beheld the interior of Jondrette’s hovel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII—THE USE MADE OF M. LEBLANC’S FIVE-FRANC PIECE\n\n\nNothing in the aspect of the family was altered, except that the wife\nand daughters had levied on the package and put on woollen stockings\nand jackets. Two new blankets were thrown across the two beds.\n\nJondrette had evidently just returned. He still had the breathlessness\nof out of doors. His daughters were seated on the floor near the\nfireplace, the elder engaged in dressing the younger’s wounded hand.\nHis wife had sunk back on the bed near the fireplace, with a face\nindicative of astonishment. Jondrette was pacing up and down the garret\nwith long strides. His eyes were extraordinary.\n\nThe woman, who seemed timid and overwhelmed with stupor in the presence\nof her husband, turned to say:—\n\n“What, really? You are sure?”\n\n\n“Sure! Eight years have passed! But I recognize him! Ah! I recognize\nhim. I knew him at once! What! Didn’t it force itself on you?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“But I told you: ‘Pay attention!’ Why, it is his figure, it is his\nface, only older,—there are people who do not grow old, I don’t know\nhow they manage it,—it is the very sound of his voice. He is better\ndressed, that is all! Ah! you mysterious old devil, I’ve got you, that\nI have!”\n\n\nHe paused, and said to his daughters:—\n\n“Get out of here, you!—It’s queer that it didn’t strike you!”\n\n\nThey arose to obey.\n\nThe mother stammered:—\n\n“With her injured hand.”\n\n\n“The air will do it good,” said Jondrette. “Be off.”\n\n\nIt was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one offers to\nreply. The two girls departed.\n\nAt the moment when they were about to pass through the door, the father\ndetained the elder by the arm, and said to her with a peculiar accent:—\n\n“You will be here at five o’clock precisely. Both of you. I shall need\nyou.”\n\n\nMarius redoubled his attention.\n\nOn being left alone with his wife, Jondrette began to pace the room\nagain, and made the tour of it two or three times in silence. Then he\nspent several minutes in tucking the lower part of the woman’s chemise\nwhich he wore into his trousers.\n\nAll at once, he turned to the female Jondrette, folded his arms and\nexclaimed:—\n\n“And would you like to have me tell you something? The young lady—”\n\n\n“Well, what?” retorted his wife, “the young lady?”\n\n\nMarius could not doubt that it was really she of whom they were\nspeaking. He listened with ardent anxiety. His whole life was in his\nears.\n\nBut Jondrette had bent over and spoke to his wife in a whisper. Then he\nstraightened himself up and concluded aloud:—\n\n“It is she!”\n\n\n“That one?” said his wife.\n\n“That very one,” said the husband.\n\nNo expression can reproduce the significance of the mother’s words.\nSurprise, rage, hate, wrath, were mingled and combined in one monstrous\nintonation. The pronunciation of a few words, the name, no doubt, which\nher husband had whispered in her ear, had sufficed to rouse this huge,\nsomnolent woman, and from being repulsive she became terrible.\n\n“It is not possible!” she cried. “When I think that my daughters are\ngoing barefoot, and have not a gown to their backs! What! A satin\npelisse, a velvet bonnet, boots, and everything; more than two hundred\nfrancs’ worth of clothes! so that one would think she was a lady! No,\nyou are mistaken! Why, in the first place, the other was hideous, and\nthis one is not so bad-looking! She really is not bad-looking! It can’t\nbe she!”\n\n\n“I tell you that it is she. You will see.”\n\n\nAt this absolute assertion, the Jondrette woman raised her large, red,\nblonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression. At\nthat moment, she seemed to Marius even more to be feared than her\nhusband. She was a sow with the look of a tigress.\n\n“What!” she resumed, “that horrible, beautiful young lady, who gazed at\nmy daughters with an air of pity,—she is that beggar brat! Oh! I should\nlike to kick her stomach in for her!”\n\n\nShe sprang off of the bed, and remained standing for a moment, her hair\nin disorder, her nostrils dilating, her mouth half open, her fists\nclenched and drawn back. Then she fell back on the bed once more. The\nman paced to and fro and paid no attention to his female.\n\nAfter a silence lasting several minutes, he approached the female\nJondrette, and halted in front of her, with folded arms, as he had done\na moment before:—\n\n“And shall I tell you another thing?”\n\n\n“What is it?” she asked.\n\nHe answered in a low, curt voice:—\n\n“My fortune is made.”\n\n\nThe woman stared at him with the look that signifies: “Is the person\nwho is addressing me on the point of going mad?”\n\n\nHe went on:—\n\n“Thunder! It was not so very long ago that I was a parishioner of the\nparish of\ndie-of-hunger-if-you-have-a-fire,-die-of-cold-if-you-have-bread! I have\nhad enough of misery! my share and other people’s share! I am not\njoking any longer, I don’t find it comic any more, I’ve had enough of\npuns, good God! no more farces, Eternal Father! I want to eat till I am\nfull, I want to drink my fill! to gormandize! to sleep! to do nothing!\nI want to have my turn, so I do, come now! before I die! I want to be a\nbit of a millionnaire!”\n\n\nHe took a turn round the hovel, and added:—\n\n“Like other people.”\n\n\n“What do you mean by that?” asked the woman.\n\nHe shook his head, winked, screwed up one eye, and raised his voice\nlike a medical professor who is about to make a demonstration:—\n\n“What do I mean by that? Listen!”\n\n\n“Hush!” muttered the woman, “not so loud! These are matters which must\nnot be overheard.”\n\n\n“Bah! Who’s here? Our neighbor? I saw him go out a little while ago.\nBesides, he doesn’t listen, the big booby. And I tell you that I saw\nhim go out.”\n\n\nNevertheless, by a sort of instinct, Jondrette lowered his voice,\nalthough not sufficiently to prevent Marius hearing his words. One\nfavorable circumstance, which enabled Marius not to lose a word of this\nconversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles\non the boulevard.\n\nThis is what Marius heard:—\n\n“Listen carefully. The Crœsus is caught, or as good as caught! That’s\nall settled already. Everything is arranged. I have seen some people.\nHe will come here this evening at six o’clock. To bring sixty francs,\nthe rascal! Did you notice how I played that game on him, my sixty\nfrancs, my landlord, my fourth of February? I don’t even owe for one\nquarter! Isn’t he a fool! So he will come at six o’clock! That’s the\nhour when our neighbor goes to his dinner. Mother Bougon is off washing\ndishes in the city. There’s not a soul in the house. The neighbor never\ncomes home until eleven o’clock. The children shall stand on watch. You\nshall help us. He will give in.”\n\n\n“And what if he does not give in?” demanded his wife.\n\nJondrette made a sinister gesture, and said:—\n\n“We’ll fix him.”\n\n\nAnd he burst out laughing.\n\nThis was the first time Marius had seen him laugh. The laugh was cold\nand sweet, and provoked a shudder.\n\nJondrette opened a cupboard near the fireplace, and drew from it an old\ncap, which he placed on his head, after brushing it with his sleeve.\n\n“Now,” said he, “I’m going out. I have some more people that I must\nsee. Good ones. You’ll see how well the whole thing will work. I shall\nbe away as short a time as possible, it’s a fine stroke of business, do\nyou look after the house.”\n\n\nAnd with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers, he stood\nfor a moment in thought, then exclaimed:—\n\n“Do you know, it’s mighty lucky, by the way, that he didn’t recognize\nme! If he had recognized me on his side, he would not have come back\nagain. He would have slipped through our fingers! It was my beard that\nsaved us! my romantic beard! my pretty little romantic beard!”\n\n\nAnd again he broke into a laugh.\n\nHe stepped to the window. The snow was still falling, and streaking the\ngray of the sky.\n\n“What beastly weather!” said he.\n\nThen lapping his overcoat across his breast:—\n\n“This rind is too large for me. Never mind,” he added, “he did a\ndevilish good thing in leaving it for me, the old scoundrel! If it\nhadn’t been for that, I couldn’t have gone out, and everything would\nhave gone wrong! What small points things hang on, anyway!”\n\n\nAnd pulling his cap down over his eyes, he quitted the room.\n\nHe had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door, when\nthe door opened again, and his savage but intelligent face made its\nappearance once more in the opening.\n\n“I came near forgetting,” said he. “You are to have a brazier of\ncharcoal ready.”\n\n\nAnd he flung into his wife’s apron the five-franc piece which the\n“philanthropist” had left with him.\n\n“A brazier of charcoal?” asked his wife.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“How many bushels?”\n\n\n“Two good ones.”\n\n\n“That will come to thirty sous. With the rest I will buy something for\ndinner.”\n\n\n“The devil, no.”\n\n\n“Why?”\n\n\n“Don’t go and spend the hundred-sou piece.”\n\n\n“Why?”\n\n\n“Because I shall have to buy something, too.”\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“Something.”\n\n\n“How much shall you need?”\n\n\n“Whereabouts in the neighborhood is there an ironmonger’s shop?”\n\n\n“Rue Mouffetard.”\n\n\n“Ah! yes, at the corner of a street; I can see the shop.”\n\n\n“But tell me how much you will need for what you have to purchase?”\n\n\n“Fifty sous—three francs.”\n\n\n“There won’t be much left for dinner.”\n\n\n“Eating is not the point to-day. There’s something better to be done.”\n\n\n“That’s enough, my jewel.”\n\n\nAt this word from his wife, Jondrette closed the door again, and this\ntime, Marius heard his step die away in the corridor of the hovel, and\ndescend the staircase rapidly.\n\nAt that moment, one o’clock struck from the church of Saint-Médard.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII—SOLUS CUM SOLO, IN LOCO REMOTO, NON COGITABUNTUR ORARE\nPATER NOSTER\n\n\nMarius, dreamer as he was, was, as we have said, firm and energetic by\nnature. His habits of solitary meditation, while they had developed in\nhim sympathy and compassion, had, perhaps, diminished the faculty for\nirritation, but had left intact the power of waxing indignant; he had\nthe kindliness of a brahmin, and the severity of a judge; he took pity\nupon a toad, but he crushed a viper. Now, it was into a hole of vipers\nthat his glance had just been directed, it was a nest of monsters that\nhe had beneath his eyes.\n\n“These wretches must be stamped upon,” said he.\n\nNot one of the enigmas which he had hoped to see solved had been\nelucidated; on the contrary, all of them had been rendered more dense,\nif anything; he knew nothing more about the beautiful maiden of the\nLuxembourg and the man whom he called M. Leblanc, except that Jondrette\nwas acquainted with them. Athwart the mysterious words which had been\nuttered, the only thing of which he caught a distinct glimpse was the\nfact that an ambush was in course of preparation, a dark but terrible\ntrap; that both of them were incurring great danger, she probably, her\nfather certainly; that they must be saved; that the hideous plots of\nthe Jondrettes must be thwarted, and the web of these spiders broken.\n\nHe scanned the female Jondrette for a moment. She had pulled an old\nsheet-iron stove from a corner, and she was rummaging among the old\nheap of iron.\n\nHe descended from the commode as softly as possible, taking care not to\nmake the least noise. Amid his terror as to what was in preparation,\nand in the horror with which the Jondrettes had inspired him, he\nexperienced a sort of joy at the idea that it might be granted to him\nperhaps to render a service to the one whom he loved.\n\nBut how was it to be done? How warn the persons threatened? He did not\nknow their address. They had reappeared for an instant before his eyes,\nand had then plunged back again into the immense depths of Paris.\nShould he wait for M. Leblanc at the door that evening at six o’clock,\nat the moment of his arrival, and warn him of the trap? But Jondrette\nand his men would see him on the watch, the spot was lonely, they were\nstronger than he, they would devise means to seize him or to get him\naway, and the man whom Marius was anxious to save would be lost. One\no’clock had just struck, the trap was to be sprung at six. Marius had\nfive hours before him.\n\nThere was but one thing to be done.\n\nHe put on his decent coat, knotted a silk handkerchief round his neck,\ntook his hat, and went out, without making any more noise than if he\nhad been treading on moss with bare feet.\n\nMoreover, the Jondrette woman continued to rummage among her old iron.\n\nOnce outside of the house, he made for the Rue du Petit-Banquier.\n\nHe had almost reached the middle of this street, near a very low wall\nwhich a man can easily step over at certain points, and which abuts on\na waste space, and was walking slowly, in consequence of his\npreoccupied condition, and the snow deadened the sound of his steps;\nall at once he heard voices talking very close by. He turned his head,\nthe street was deserted, there was not a soul in it, it was broad\ndaylight, and yet he distinctly heard voices.\n\nIt occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting.\n\nThere, in fact, sat two men, flat on the snow, with their backs against\nthe wall, talking together in subdued tones.\n\nThese two persons were strangers to him; one was a bearded man in a\nblouse, and the other a long-haired individual in rags. The bearded man\nhad on a fez, the other’s head was bare, and the snow had lodged in his\nhair.\n\nBy thrusting his head over the wall, Marius could hear their remarks.\n\nThe hairy one jogged the other man’s elbow and said:—\n\n“—With the assistance of Patron-Minette, it can’t fail.”\n\n\n“Do you think so?” said the bearded man.\n\nAnd the long-haired one began again:—\n\n“It’s as good as a warrant for each one, of five hundred balls, and the\nworst that can happen is five years, six years, ten years at the most!”\n\n\nThe other replied with some hesitation, and shivering beneath his fez:—\n\n“That’s a real thing. You can’t go against such things.”\n\n\n“I tell you that the affair can’t go wrong,” resumed the long-haired\nman. “Father What’s-his-name’s team will be already harnessed.”\n\n\nThen they began to discuss a melodrama that they had seen on the\npreceding evening at the Gaîté Theatre.\n\nMarius went his way.\n\nIt seemed to him that the mysterious words of these men, so strangely\nhidden behind that wall, and crouching in the snow, could not but bear\nsome relation to Jondrette’s abominable projects. That must be _the\naffair_.\n\nHe directed his course towards the faubourg Saint-Marceau and asked at\nthe first shop he came to where he could find a commissary of police.\n\nHe was directed to Rue de Pontoise, No. 14.\n\nThither Marius betook himself.\n\nAs he passed a baker’s shop, he bought a two-penny roll, and ate it,\nforeseeing that he should not dine.\n\nOn the way, he rendered justice to Providence. He reflected that had he\nnot given his five francs to the Jondrette girl in the morning, he\nwould have followed M. Leblanc’s fiacre, and consequently have remained\nignorant of everything, and that there would have been no obstacle to\nthe trap of the Jondrettes and that M. Leblanc would have been lost,\nand his daughter with him, no doubt.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV—IN WHICH A POLICE AGENT BESTOWS TWO FISTFULS ON A LAWYER\n\n\nOn arriving at No. 14, Rue de Pontoise, he ascended to the first floor\nand inquired for the commissary of police.\n\n“The commissary of police is not here,” said a clerk; “but there is an\ninspector who takes his place. Would you like to speak to him? Are you\nin haste?”\n\n\n“Yes,” said Marius.\n\nThe clerk introduced him into the commissary’s office. There stood a\ntall man behind a grating, leaning against a stove, and holding up with\nboth hands the tails of a vast topcoat, with three collars. His face\nwas square, with a thin, firm mouth, thick, gray, and very ferocious\nwhiskers, and a look that was enough to turn your pockets inside out.\nOf that glance it might have been well said, not that it penetrated,\nbut that it searched.\n\nThis man’s air was not much less ferocious nor less terrible than\nJondrette’s; the dog is, at times, no less terrible to meet than the\nwolf.\n\n“What do you want?” he said to Marius, without adding “monsieur.”\n\n\n“Is this Monsieur le Commissaire de Police?”\n\n\n“He is absent. I am here in his stead.”\n\n\n“The matter is very private.”\n\n\n“Then speak.”\n\n\n“And great haste is required.”\n\n\n“Then speak quick.”\n\n\nThis calm, abrupt man was both terrifying and reassuring at one and the\nsame time. He inspired fear and confidence. Marius related the\nadventure to him: That a person with whom he was not acquainted\notherwise than by sight, was to be inveigled into a trap that very\nevening; that, as he occupied the room adjoining the den, he, Marius\nPontmercy, a lawyer, had heard the whole plot through the partition;\nthat the wretch who had planned the trap was a certain Jondrette; that\nthere would be accomplices, probably some prowlers of the barriers,\namong others a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille;\nthat Jondrette’s daughters were to lie in wait; that there was no way\nof warning the threatened man, since he did not even know his name; and\nthat, finally, all this was to be carried out at six o’clock that\nevening, at the most deserted point of the Boulevard de l’Hôpital, in\nhouse No. 50-52.\n\nAt the sound of this number, the inspector raised his head, and said\ncoldly:—\n\n“So it is in the room at the end of the corridor?”\n\n\n“Precisely,” answered Marius, and he added: “Are you acquainted with\nthat house?”\n\n\nThe inspector remained silent for a moment, then replied, as he warmed\nthe heel of his boot at the door of the stove:—\n\n“Apparently.”\n\n\nHe went on, muttering between his teeth, and not addressing Marius so\nmuch as his cravat:—\n\n“Patron-Minette must have had a hand in this.”\n\n\nThis word struck Marius.\n\n“Patron-Minette,” said he, “I did hear that word pronounced, in fact.”\n\n\nAnd he repeated to the inspector the dialogue between the long-haired\nman and the bearded man in the snow behind the wall of the Rue du\nPetit-Banquier.\n\nThe inspector muttered:—\n\n“The long-haired man must be Brujon, and the bearded one Demi-Liard,\nalias Deux-Milliards.”\n\n\nHe had dropped his eyelids again, and became absorbed in thought.\n\n“As for Father What’s-his-name, I think I recognize him. Here, I’ve\nburned my coat. They always have too much fire in these cursed stoves.\nNumber 50-52. Former property of Gorbeau.”\n\n\nThen he glanced at Marius.\n\n“You saw only that bearded and that long-haired man?”\n\n\n“And Panchaud.”\n\n\n“You didn’t see a little imp of a dandy prowling about the premises?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“Nor a big lump of matter, resembling an elephant in the Jardin des\nPlantes?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“Nor a scamp with the air of an old red tail?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“As for the fourth, no one sees him, not even his adjutants, clerks,\nand employees. It is not surprising that you did not see him.”\n\n\n“No. Who are all those persons?” asked Marius.\n\nThe inspector answered:—\n\n“Besides, this is not the time for them.”\n\n\nHe relapsed into silence, then resumed:—\n\n“50-52. I know that barrack. Impossible to conceal ourselves inside it\nwithout the artists seeing us, and then they will get off simply by\ncountermanding the vaudeville. They are so modest! An audience\nembarrasses them. None of that, none of that. I want to hear them sing\nand make them dance.”\n\n\nThis monologue concluded, he turned to Marius, and demanded, gazing at\nhim intently the while:—\n\n“Are you afraid?”\n\n\n“Of what?” said Marius.\n\n“Of these men?”\n\n\n“No more than yourself!” retorted Marius rudely, who had begun to\nnotice that this police agent had not yet said “monsieur” to him.\n\nThe inspector stared still more intently at Marius, and continued with\nsententious solemnity:—\n\n“There, you speak like a brave man, and like an honest man. Courage\ndoes not fear crime, and honesty does not fear authority.”\n\n\nMarius interrupted him:—\n\n“That is well, but what do you intend to do?”\n\n\nThe inspector contented himself with the remark:—\n\n“The lodgers have pass-keys with which to get in at night. You must\nhave one.”\n\n\n“Yes,” said Marius.\n\n“Have you it about you?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Give it to me,” said the inspector.\n\nMarius took his key from his waistcoat pocket, handed it to the\ninspector and added:—\n\n“If you will take my advice, you will come in force.”\n\n\nThe inspector cast on Marius such a glance as Voltaire might have\nbestowed on a provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him;\nwith one movement he plunged his hands, which were enormous, into the\ntwo immense pockets of his top-coat, and pulled out two small steel\npistols, of the sort called “knock-me-downs.” Then he presented them to\nMarius, saying rapidly, in a curt tone:—\n\n“Take these. Go home. Hide in your chamber, so that you may be supposed\nto have gone out. They are loaded. Each one carries two balls. You will\nkeep watch; there is a hole in the wall, as you have informed me. These\nmen will come. Leave them to their own devices for a time. When you\nthink matters have reached a crisis, and that it is time to put a stop\nto them, fire a shot. Not too soon. The rest concerns me. A shot into\nthe ceiling, the air, no matter where. Above all things, not too soon.\nWait until they begin to put their project into execution; you are a\nlawyer; you know the proper point.” Marius took the pistols and put\nthem in the side pocket of his coat.\n\n“That makes a lump that can be seen,” said the inspector. “Put them in\nyour trousers pocket.”\n\n\nMarius hid the pistols in his trousers pockets.\n\n“Now,” pursued the inspector, “there is not a minute more to be lost by\nany one. What time is it? Half-past two. Seven o’clock is the hour?”\n\n\n“Six o’clock,” answered Marius.\n\n“I have plenty of time,” said the inspector, “but no more than enough.\nDon’t forget anything that I have said to you. Bang. A pistol shot.”\n\n\n“Rest easy,” said Marius.\n\nAnd as Marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his way out,\nthe inspector called to him:—\n\n“By the way, if you have occasion for my services between now and then,\ncome or send here. You will ask for Inspector Javert.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV—JONDRETTE MAKES HIS PURCHASES\n\n\nA few moments later, about three o’clock, Courfeyrac chanced to be\npassing along the Rue Mouffetard in company with Bossuet. The snow had\nredoubled in violence, and filled the air. Bossuet was just saying to\nCourfeyrac:—\n\n“One would say, to see all these snow-flakes fall, that there was a\nplague of white butterflies in heaven.” All at once, Bossuet caught\nsight of Marius coming up the street towards the barrier with a\npeculiar air.\n\n“Hold!” said Bossuet. “There’s Marius.”\n\n\n“I saw him,” said Courfeyrac. “Don’t let’s speak to him.”\n\n\n“Why?”\n\n\n“He is busy.”\n\n\n“With what?”\n\n\n“Don’t you see his air?”\n\n\n“What air?”\n\n\n“He has the air of a man who is following some one.”\n\n\n“That’s true,” said Bossuet.\n\n“Just see the eyes he is making!” said Courfeyrac.\n\n“But who the deuce is he following?”\n\n\n“Some fine, flowery bonneted wench! He’s in love.”\n\n\n“But,” observed Bossuet, “I don’t see any wench nor any flowery bonnet\nin the street. There’s not a woman round.”\n\n\nCourfeyrac took a survey, and exclaimed:—\n\n“He’s following a man!”\n\n\nA man, in fact, wearing a gray cap, and whose gray beard could be\ndistinguished, although they only saw his back, was walking along about\ntwenty paces in advance of Marius.\n\nThis man was dressed in a great-coat which was perfectly new and too\nlarge for him, and in a frightful pair of trousers all hanging in rags\nand black with mud.\n\nBossuet burst out laughing.\n\n“Who is that man?”\n\n\n“He?” retorted Courfeyrac, “he’s a poet. Poets are very fond of wearing\nthe trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the overcoats of peers of\nFrance.”\n\n\n“Let’s see where Marius will go,” said Bossuet; “let’s see where the\nman is going, let’s follow them, hey?”\n\n\n“Bossuet!” exclaimed Courfeyrac, “eagle of Meaux! You are a prodigious\nbrute. Follow a man who is following another man, indeed!”\n\n\nThey retraced their steps.\n\nMarius had, in fact, seen Jondrette passing along the Rue Mouffetard,\nand was spying on his proceedings.\n\nJondrette walked straight ahead, without a suspicion that he was\nalready held by a glance.\n\nHe quitted the Rue Mouffetard, and Marius saw him enter one of the most\nterrible hovels in the Rue Gracieuse; he remained there about a quarter\nof an hour, then returned to the Rue Mouffetard. He halted at an\nironmonger’s shop, which then stood at the corner of the Rue\nPierre-Lombard, and a few minutes later Marius saw him emerge from the\nshop, holding in his hand a huge cold chisel with a white wood handle,\nwhich he concealed beneath his great-coat. At the top of the Rue\nPetit-Gentilly he turned to the left and proceeded rapidly to the Rue\ndu Petit-Banquier. The day was declining; the snow, which had ceased\nfor a moment, had just begun again. Marius posted himself on the watch\nat the very corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, which was deserted, as\nusual, and did not follow Jondrette into it. It was lucky that he did\nso, for, on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where Marius had heard\nthe long-haired man and the bearded man conversing, Jondrette turned\nround, made sure that no one was following him, did not see him, then\nsprang across the wall and disappeared.\n\nThe waste land bordered by this wall communicated with the back yard of\nan ex-livery stable-keeper of bad repute, who had failed and who still\nkept a few old single-seated berlins under his sheds.\n\nMarius thought that it would be wise to profit by Jondrette’s absence\nto return home; moreover, it was growing late; every evening, Ma’am\nBougon when she set out for her dish-washing in town, had a habit of\nlocking the door, which was always closed at dusk. Marius had given his\nkey to the inspector of police; it was important, therefore, that he\nshould make haste.\n\nEvening had arrived, night had almost closed in; on the horizon and in\nthe immensity of space, there remained but one spot illuminated by the\nsun, and that was the moon.\n\nIt was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low dome of Salpêtrière.\n\nMarius returned to No. 50-52 with great strides. The door was still\nopen when he arrived. He mounted the stairs on tip-toe and glided along\nthe wall of the corridor to his chamber. This corridor, as the reader\nwill remember, was bordered on both sides by attics, all of which were,\nfor the moment, empty and to let. Ma’am Bougon was in the habit of\nleaving all the doors open. As he passed one of these attics, Marius\nthought he perceived in the uninhabited cell the motionless heads of\nfour men, vaguely lighted up by a remnant of daylight, falling through\na dormer window.\n\nMarius made no attempt to see, not wishing to be seen himself. He\nsucceeded in reaching his chamber without being seen and without making\nany noise. It was high time. A moment later he heard Ma’am Bougon take\nher departure, locking the door of the house behind her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI—IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE WORDS TO AN ENGLISH AIR WHICH\nWAS IN FASHION IN 1832\n\n\nMarius seated himself on his bed. It might have been half-past five\no’clock. Only half an hour separated him from what was about to happen.\nHe heard the beating of his arteries as one hears the ticking of a\nwatch in the dark. He thought of the double march which was going on at\nthat moment in the dark,—crime advancing on one side, justice coming up\non the other. He was not afraid, but he could not think without a\nshudder of what was about to take place. As is the case with all those\nwho are suddenly assailed by an unforeseen adventure, the entire day\nproduced upon him the effect of a dream, and in order to persuade\nhimself that he was not the prey of a nightmare, he had to feel the\ncold barrels of the steel pistols in his trousers pockets.\n\nIt was no longer snowing; the moon disengaged itself more and more\nclearly from the mist, and its light, mingled with the white reflection\nof the snow which had fallen, communicated to the chamber a sort of\ntwilight aspect.\n\nThere was a light in the Jondrette den. Marius saw the hole in the wall\nshining with a reddish glow which seemed bloody to him.\n\nIt was true that the light could not be produced by a candle. However,\nthere was not a sound in the Jondrette quarters, not a soul was moving\nthere, not a soul speaking, not a breath; the silence was glacial and\nprofound, and had it not been for that light, he might have thought\nhimself next door to a sepulchre.\n\nMarius softly removed his boots and pushed them under his bed.\n\nSeveral minutes elapsed. Marius heard the lower door turn on its\nhinges; a heavy step mounted the staircase, and hastened along the\ncorridor; the latch of the hovel was noisily lifted; it was Jondrette\nreturning.\n\nInstantly, several voices arose. The whole family was in the garret.\nOnly, it had been silent in the master’s absence, like wolf whelps in\nthe absence of the wolf.\n\n“It’s I,” said he.\n\n“Good evening, daddy,” yelped the girls.\n\n“Well?” said the mother.\n\n“All’s going first-rate,” responded Jondrette, “but my feet are beastly\ncold. Good! You have dressed up. You have done well! You must inspire\nconfidence.”\n\n\n“All ready to go out.”\n\n\n“Don’t forget what I told you. You will do everything sure?”\n\n\n“Rest easy.”\n\n\n“Because—” said Jondrette. And he left the phrase unfinished.\n\nMarius heard him lay something heavy on the table, probably the chisel\nwhich he had purchased.\n\n“By the way,” said Jondrette, “have you been eating here?”\n\n\n“Yes,” said the mother. “I got three large potatoes and some salt. I\ntook advantage of the fire to cook them.”\n\n\n“Good,” returned Jondrette. “To-morrow I will take you out to dine with\nme. We will have a duck and fixings. You shall dine like Charles the\nTenth; all is going well!”\n\n\nThen he added:—\n\n“The mouse-trap is open. The cats are there.”\n\n\nHe lowered his voice still further, and said:—\n\n“Put this in the fire.”\n\n\nMarius heard a sound of charcoal being knocked with the tongs or some\niron utensil, and Jondrette continued:—\n\n“Have you greased the hinges of the door so that they will not squeak?”\n\n\n“Yes,” replied the mother.\n\n“What time is it?”\n\n\n“Nearly six. The half-hour struck from Saint-Médard a while ago.”\n\n\n“The devil!” ejaculated Jondrette; “the children must go and watch.\nCome you, do you listen here.”\n\n\nA whispering ensued.\n\nJondrette’s voice became audible again:—\n\n“Has old Bougon left?”\n\n\n“Yes,” said the mother.\n\n“Are you sure that there is no one in our neighbor’s room?”\n\n\n“He has not been in all day, and you know very well that this is his\ndinner hour.”\n\n\n“You are sure?”\n\n\n“Sure.”\n\n\n“All the same,” said Jondrette, “there’s no harm in going to see\nwhether he is there. Here, my girl, take the candle and go there.”\n\n\nMarius fell on his hands and knees and crawled silently under his bed.\n\nHardly had he concealed himself, when he perceived a light through the\ncrack of his door.\n\n“P’pa,” cried a voice, “he is not in here.”\n\n\nHe recognized the voice of the eldest daughter.\n\n“Did you go in?” demanded her father.\n\n“No,” replied the girl, “but as his key is in the door, he must be\nout.”\n\n\nThe father exclaimed:—\n\n“Go in, nevertheless.”\n\n\nThe door opened, and Marius saw the tall Jondrette come in with a\ncandle in her hand. She was as she had been in the morning, only still\nmore repulsive in this light.\n\nShe walked straight up to the bed. Marius endured an indescribable\nmoment of anxiety; but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the\nwall, and it was thither that she was directing her steps. She raised\nherself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it. In the neighboring room,\nthe sound of iron articles being moved was audible.\n\nShe smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand, and smiled into the\nmirror, humming with her cracked and sepulchral voice:—\n\nNos amours ont duré toute une semaine,\nMais que du bonheur les instants sont courts!\nS’adorer huit jours, c‘était bien la peine!\nLe temps des amours devrait durer toujours!\nDevrait durer toujours! devrait durer toujours!28\n\n\nIn the meantime, Marius trembled. It seemed impossible to him that she\nshould not hear his breathing.\n\nShe stepped to the window and looked out with the half-foolish way she\nhad.\n\n“How ugly Paris is when it has put on a white chemise!” said she.\n\nShe returned to the mirror and began again to put on airs before it,\nscrutinizing herself full-face and three-quarters face in turn.\n\n“Well!” cried her father, “what are you about there?”\n\n\n“I am looking under the bed and the furniture,” she replied, continuing\nto arrange her hair; “there’s no one here.”\n\n\n“Booby!” yelled her father. “Come here this minute! And don’t waste any\ntime about it!”\n\n\n“Coming! Coming!” said she. “One has no time for anything in this\nhovel!”\n\n\nShe hummed:—\n\nVous me quittez pour aller à la gloire;\nMon triste cœur suivra partout.29\n\n\nShe cast a parting glance in the mirror and went out, shutting the door\nbehind her.\n\nA moment more, and Marius heard the sound of the two young girls’ bare\nfeet in the corridor, and Jondrette’s voice shouting to them:—\n\n“Pay strict heed! One on the side of the barrier, the other at the\ncorner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier. Don’t lose sight for a moment of\nthe door of this house, and the moment you see anything, rush here on\nthe instant! as hard as you can go! You have a key to get in.”\n\n\nThe eldest girl grumbled:—\n\n“The idea of standing watch in the snow barefoot!”\n\n\n“To-morrow you shall have some dainty little green silk boots!” said\nthe father.\n\nThey ran downstairs, and a few seconds later the shock of the outer\ndoor as it banged to announced that they were outside.\n\nThere now remained in the house only Marius, the Jondrettes and\nprobably, also, the mysterious persons of whom Marius had caught a\nglimpse in the twilight, behind the door of the unused attic.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII—THE USE MADE OF MARIUS’ FIVE-FRANC PIECE\n\n\nMarius decided that the moment had now arrived when he must resume his\npost at his observatory. In a twinkling, and with the agility of his\nage, he had reached the hole in the partition.\n\nHe looked.\n\nThe interior of the Jondrette apartment presented a curious aspect, and\nMarius found an explanation of the singular light which he had noticed.\nA candle was burning in a candlestick covered with verdigris, but that\nwas not what really lighted the chamber. The hovel was completely\nilluminated, as it were, by the reflection from a rather large\nsheet-iron brazier standing in the fireplace, and filled with burning\ncharcoal, the brazier prepared by the Jondrette woman that morning. The\ncharcoal was glowing hot and the brazier was red; a blue flame\nflickered over it, and helped him to make out the form of the chisel\npurchased by Jondrette in the Rue Pierre-Lombard, where it had been\nthrust into the brazier to heat. In one corner, near the door, and as\nthough prepared for some definite use, two heaps were visible, which\nappeared to be, the one a heap of old iron, the other a heap of ropes.\nAll this would have caused the mind of a person who knew nothing of\nwhat was in preparation, to waver between a very sinister and a very\nsimple idea. The lair thus lighted up more resembled a forge than a\nmouth of hell, but Jondrette, in this light, had rather the air of a\ndemon than of a smith.\n\nThe heat of the brazier was so great, that the candle on the table was\nmelting on the side next the chafing-dish, and was drooping over. An\nold dark-lantern of copper, worthy of Diogenes turned Cartouche, stood\non the chimney-piece.\n\nThe brazier, placed in the fireplace itself, beside the nearly extinct\nbrands, sent its vapors up the chimney, and gave out no odor.\n\nThe moon, entering through the four panes of the window, cast its\nwhiteness into the crimson and flaming garret; and to the poetic spirit\nof Marius, who was dreamy even in the moment of action, it was like a\nthought of heaven mingled with the misshapen reveries of earth.\n\nA breath of air which made its way in through the open pane, helped to\ndissipate the smell of the charcoal and to conceal the presence of the\nbrazier.\n\nThe Jondrette lair was, if the reader recalls what we have said of the\nGorbeau building, admirably chosen to serve as the theatre of a violent\nand sombre deed, and as the envelope for a crime. It was the most\nretired chamber in the most isolated house on the most deserted\nboulevard in Paris. If the system of ambush and traps had not already\nexisted, they would have been invented there.\n\nThe whole thickness of a house and a multitude of uninhabited rooms\nseparated this den from the boulevard, and the only window that existed\nopened on waste lands enclosed with walls and palisades.\n\nJondrette had lighted his pipe, seated himself on the seatless chair,\nand was engaged in smoking. His wife was talking to him in a low tone.\n\nIf Marius had been Courfeyrac, that is to say, one of those men who\nlaugh on every occasion in life, he would have burst with laughter when\nhis gaze fell on the Jondrette woman. She had on a black bonnet with\nplumes not unlike the hats of the heralds-at-arms at the coronation of\nCharles X., an immense tartan shawl over her knitted petticoat, and the\nman’s shoes which her daughter had scorned in the morning. It was this\ntoilette which had extracted from Jondrette the exclamation: “Good! You\nhave dressed up. You have done well. You must inspire confidence!”\n\n\nAs for Jondrette, he had not taken off the new surtout, which was too\nlarge for him, and which M. Leblanc had given him, and his costume\ncontinued to present that contrast of coat and trousers which\nconstituted the ideal of a poet in Courfeyrac’s eyes.\n\nAll at once, Jondrette lifted up his voice:—\n\n“By the way! Now that I think of it. In this weather, he will come in a\ncarriage. Light the lantern, take it and go downstairs. You will stand\nbehind the lower door. The very moment that you hear the carriage stop,\nyou will open the door, instantly, he will come up, you will light the\nstaircase and the corridor, and when he enters here, you will go\ndownstairs again as speedily as possible, you will pay the coachman,\nand dismiss the fiacre.”\n\n\n“And the money?” inquired the woman.\n\nJondrette fumbled in his trousers pocket and handed her five francs.\n\n“What’s this?” she exclaimed.\n\nJondrette replied with dignity:—\n\n“That is the monarch which our neighbor gave us this morning.”\n\n\nAnd he added:—\n\n“Do you know what? Two chairs will be needed here.”\n\n\n“What for?”\n\n\n“To sit on.”\n\n\nMarius felt a cold chill pass through his limbs at hearing this mild\nanswer from Jondrette.\n\n“Pardieu! I’ll go and get one of our neighbor’s.”\n\n\nAnd with a rapid movement, she opened the door of the den, and went out\ninto the corridor.\n\nMarius absolutely had not the time to descend from the commode, reach\nhis bed, and conceal himself beneath it.\n\n“Take the candle,” cried Jondrette.\n\n“No,” said she, “it would embarrass me, I have the two chairs to carry.\nThere is moonlight.”\n\n\nMarius heard Mother Jondrette’s heavy hand fumbling at his lock in the\ndark. The door opened. He remained nailed to the spot with the shock\nand with horror.\n\nThe Jondrette entered.\n\nThe dormer window permitted the entrance of a ray of moonlight between\ntwo blocks of shadow. One of these blocks of shadow entirely covered\nthe wall against which Marius was leaning, so that he disappeared\nwithin it.\n\nMother Jondrette raised her eyes, did not see Marius, took the two\nchairs, the only ones which Marius possessed, and went away, letting\nthe door fall heavily to behind her.\n\nShe re-entered the lair.\n\n“Here are the two chairs.”\n\n\n“And here is the lantern. Go down as quick as you can.”\n\n\nShe hastily obeyed, and Jondrette was left alone.\n\nHe placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table, turned the\nchisel in the brazier, set in front of the fireplace an old screen\nwhich masked the chafing-dish, then went to the corner where lay the\npile of rope, and bent down as though to examine something. Marius then\nrecognized the fact, that what he had taken for a shapeless mass was a\nvery well-made rope-ladder, with wooden rungs and two hooks with which\nto attach it.\n\nThis ladder, and some large tools, veritable masses of iron, which were\nmingled with the old iron piled up behind the door, had not been in the\nJondrette hovel in the morning, and had evidently been brought thither\nin the afternoon, during Marius’ absence.\n\n“Those are the utensils of an edge-tool maker,” thought Marius.\n\nHad Marius been a little more learned in this line, he would have\nrecognized in what he took for the engines of an edge-tool maker,\ncertain instruments which will force a lock or pick a lock, and others\nwhich will cut or slice, the two families of tools which burglars call\n_cadets_ and _fauchants_.\n\nThe fireplace and the two chairs were exactly opposite Marius. The\nbrazier being concealed, the only light in the room was now furnished\nby the candle; the smallest bit of crockery on the table or on the\nchimney-piece cast a large shadow. There was something indescribably\ncalm, threatening, and hideous about this chamber. One felt that there\nexisted in it the anticipation of something terrible.\n\nJondrette had allowed his pipe to go out, a serious sign of\npreoccupation, and had again seated himself. The candle brought out the\nfierce and the fine angles of his countenance. He indulged in scowls\nand in abrupt unfoldings of the right hand, as though he were\nresponding to the last counsels of a sombre inward monologue. In the\ncourse of one of these dark replies which he was making to himself, he\npulled the table drawer rapidly towards him, took out a long kitchen\nknife which was concealed there, and tried the edge of its blade on his\nnail. That done, he put the knife back in the drawer and shut it.\n\nMarius, on his side, grasped the pistol in his right pocket, drew it\nout and cocked it.\n\nThe pistol emitted a sharp, clear click, as he cocked it.\n\nJondrette started, half rose, listened a moment, then began to laugh\nand said:—\n\n“What a fool I am! It’s the partition cracking!”\n\n\nMarius kept the pistol in his hand.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII—MARIUS’ TWO CHAIRS FORM A VIS-A-VIS\n\n\nSuddenly, the distant and melancholy vibration of a clock shook the\npanes. Six o’clock was striking from Saint-Médard.\n\nJondrette marked off each stroke with a toss of his head. When the\nsixth had struck, he snuffed the candle with his fingers.\n\nThen he began to pace up and down the room, listened at the corridor,\nwalked on again, then listened once more.\n\n“Provided only that he comes!” he muttered, then he returned to his\nchair.\n\nHe had hardly reseated himself when the door opened.\n\nMother Jondrette had opened it, and now remained in the corridor making\na horrible, amiable grimace, which one of the holes of the dark-lantern\nilluminated from below.\n\n“Enter, sir,” she said.\n\n“Enter, my benefactor,” repeated Jondrette, rising hastily.\n\nM. Leblanc made his appearance.\n\nHe wore an air of serenity which rendered him singularly venerable.\n\nHe laid four louis on the table.\n\n“Monsieur Fabantou,” said he, “this is for your rent and your most\npressing necessities. We will attend to the rest hereafter.”\n\n\n“May God requite it to you, my generous benefactor!” said Jondrette.\n\nAnd rapidly approaching his wife:—\n\n“Dismiss the carriage!”\n\n\nShe slipped out while her husband was lavishing salutes and offering M.\nLeblanc a chair. An instant later she returned and whispered in his\near:—\n\n“‘Tis done.”\n\n\nThe snow, which had not ceased falling since the morning, was so deep\nthat the arrival of the fiacre had not been audible, and they did not\nnow hear its departure.\n\nMeanwhile, M. Leblanc had seated himself.\n\nJondrette had taken possession of the other chair, facing M. Leblanc.\n\nNow, in order to form an idea of the scene which is to follow, let the\nreader picture to himself in his own mind, a cold night, the solitudes\nof the Salpêtrière covered with snow and white as winding-sheets in the\nmoonlight, the taper-like lights of the street lanterns which shone\nredly here and there along those tragic boulevards, and the long rows\nof black elms, not a passer-by for perhaps a quarter of a league\naround, the Gorbeau hovel, at its highest pitch of silence, of horror,\nand of darkness; in that building, in the midst of those solitudes, in\nthe midst of that darkness, the vast Jondrette garret lighted by a\nsingle candle, and in that den two men seated at a table, M. Leblanc\ntranquil, Jondrette smiling and alarming, the Jondrette woman, the\nfemale wolf, in one corner, and, behind the partition, Marius,\ninvisible, erect, not losing a word, not missing a single movement, his\neye on the watch, and pistol in hand.\n\nHowever, Marius experienced only an emotion of horror, but no fear. He\nclasped the stock of the pistol firmly and felt reassured. “I shall be\nable to stop that wretch whenever I please,” he thought.\n\nHe felt that the police were there somewhere in ambuscade, waiting for\nthe signal agreed upon and ready to stretch out their arm.\n\nMoreover, he was in hopes, that this violent encounter between\nJondrette and M. Leblanc would cast some light on all the things which\nhe was interested in learning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX—OCCUPYING ONE’S SELF WITH OBSCURE DEPTHS\n\n\nHardly was M. Leblanc seated, when he turned his eyes towards the\npallets, which were empty.\n\n“How is the poor little wounded girl?” he inquired.\n\n“Bad,” replied Jondrette with a heart-broken and grateful smile, “very\nbad, my worthy sir. Her elder sister has taken her to the Bourbe to\nhave her hurt dressed. You will see them presently; they will be back\nimmediately.”\n\n\n“Madame Fabantou seems to me to be better,” went on M. Leblanc, casting\nhis eyes on the eccentric costume of the Jondrette woman, as she stood\nbetween him and the door, as though already guarding the exit, and\ngazed at him in an attitude of menace and almost of combat.\n\n“She is dying,” said Jondrette. “But what do you expect, sir! She has\nso much courage, that woman has! She’s not a woman, she’s an ox.”\n\n\nThe Jondrette, touched by his compliment, deprecated it with the\naffected airs of a flattered monster.\n\n“You are always too good to me, Monsieur Jondrette!”\n\n\n“Jondrette!” said M. Leblanc, “I thought your name was Fabantou?”\n\n\n“Fabantou, alias Jondrette!” replied the husband hurriedly. “An\nartistic sobriquet!”\n\n\nAnd launching at his wife a shrug of the shoulders which M. Leblanc did\nnot catch, he continued with an emphatic and caressing inflection of\nvoice:—\n\n“Ah! we have had a happy life together, this poor darling and I! What\nwould there be left for us if we had not that? We are so wretched, my\nrespectable sir! We have arms, but there is no work! We have the will,\nno work! I don’t know how the government arranges that, but, on my word\nof honor, sir, I am not Jacobin, sir, I am not a bousingot.30 I don’t\nwish them any evil, but if I were the ministers, on my most sacred\nword, things would be different. Here, for instance, I wanted to have\nmy girls taught the trade of paper-box makers. You will say to me:\n‘What! a trade?’ Yes! A trade! A simple trade! A bread-winner! What a\nfall, my benefactor! What a degradation, when one has been what we have\nbeen! Alas! There is nothing left to us of our days of prosperity! One\nthing only, a picture, of which I think a great deal, but which I am\nwilling to part with, for I must live! Item, one must live!”\n\n\nWhile Jondrette thus talked, with an apparent incoherence which\ndetracted nothing from the thoughtful and sagacious expression of his\nphysiognomy, Marius raised his eyes, and perceived at the other end of\nthe room a person whom he had not seen before. A man had just entered,\nso softly that the door had not been heard to turn on its hinges. This\nman wore a violet knitted vest, which was old, worn, spotted, cut and\ngaping at every fold, wide trousers of cotton velvet, wooden shoes on\nhis feet, no shirt, had his neck bare, his bare arms tattooed, and his\nface smeared with black. He had seated himself in silence on the\nnearest bed, and, as he was behind Jondrette, he could only be\nindistinctly seen.\n\nThat sort of magnetic instinct which turns aside the gaze, caused M.\nLeblanc to turn round almost at the same moment as Marius. He could not\nrefrain from a gesture of surprise which did not escape Jondrette.\n\n“Ah! I see!” exclaimed Jondrette, buttoning up his coat with an air of\ncomplaisance, “you are looking at your overcoat? It fits me! My faith,\nbut it fits me!”\n\n\n“Who is that man?” said M. Leblanc.\n\n“Him?” ejaculated Jondrette, “he’s a neighbor of mine. Don’t pay any\nattention to him.”\n\n\nThe neighbor was a singular-looking individual. However, manufactories\nof chemical products abound in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau. Many of the\nworkmen might have black faces. Besides this, M. Leblanc’s whole person\nwas expressive of candid and intrepid confidence.\n\nHe went on:—\n\n“Excuse me; what were you saying, M. Fabantou?”\n\n\n“I was telling you, sir, and dear protector,” replied Jondrette placing\nhis elbows on the table and contemplating M. Leblanc with steady and\ntender eyes, not unlike the eyes of the boa-constrictor, “I was telling\nyou, that I have a picture to sell.”\n\n\nA slight sound came from the door. A second man had just entered and\nseated himself on the bed, behind Jondrette.\n\nLike the first, his arms were bare, and he had a mask of ink or\nlampblack.\n\nAlthough this man had, literally, glided into the room, he had not been\nable to prevent M. Leblanc catching sight of him.\n\n“Don’t mind them,” said Jondrette, “they are people who belong in the\nhouse. So I was saying, that there remains in my possession a valuable\npicture. But stop, sir, take a look at it.”\n\n\nHe rose, went to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel which we\nhave already mentioned, and turned it round, still leaving it supported\nagainst the wall. It really was something which resembled a picture,\nand which the candle illuminated, somewhat. Marius could make nothing\nout of it, as Jondrette stood between the picture and him; he only saw\na coarse daub, and a sort of principal personage colored with the harsh\ncrudity of foreign canvasses and screen paintings.\n\n“What is that?” asked M. Leblanc.\n\nJondrette exclaimed:—\n\n“A painting by a master, a picture of great value, my benefactor! I am\nas much attached to it as I am to my two daughters; it recalls\nsouvenirs to me! But I have told you, and I will not take it back, that\nI am so wretched that I will part with it.”\n\n\nEither by chance, or because he had begun to feel a dawning uneasiness,\nM. Leblanc’s glance returned to the bottom of the room as he examined\nthe picture.\n\nThere were now four men, three seated on the bed, one standing near the\ndoor-post, all four with bare arms and motionless, with faces smeared\nwith black. One of those on the bed was leaning against the wall, with\nclosed eyes, and it might have been supposed that he was asleep. He was\nold; his white hair contrasting with his blackened face produced a\nhorrible effect. The other two seemed to be young; one wore a beard,\nthe other wore his hair long. None of them had on shoes; those who did\nnot wear socks were barefooted.\n\nJondrette noticed that M. Leblanc’s eye was fixed on these men.\n\n“They are friends. They are neighbors,” said he. “Their faces are black\nbecause they work in charcoal. They are chimney-builders. Don’t trouble\nyourself about them, my benefactor, but buy my picture. Have pity on my\nmisery. I will not ask you much for it. How much do you think it is\nworth?”\n\n\n“Well,” said M. Leblanc, looking Jondrette full in the eye, and with\nthe manner of a man who is on his guard, “it is some signboard for a\ntavern, and is worth about three francs.”\n\n\nJondrette replied sweetly:—\n\n“Have you your pocket-book with you? I should be satisfied with a\nthousand crowns.”\n\n\nM. Leblanc sprang up, placed his back against the wall, and cast a\nrapid glance around the room. He had Jondrette on his left, on the side\nnext the window, and the Jondrette woman and the four men on his right,\non the side next the door. The four men did not stir, and did not even\nseem to be looking on.\n\nJondrette had again begun to speak in a plaintive tone, with so vague\nan eye, and so lamentable an intonation, that M. Leblanc might have\nsupposed that what he had before him was a man who had simply gone mad\nwith misery.\n\n“If you do not buy my picture, my dear benefactor,” said Jondrette, “I\nshall be left without resources; there will be nothing left for me but\nto throw myself into the river. When I think that I wanted to have my\ntwo girls taught the middle-class paper-box trade, the making of boxes\nfor New Year’s gifts! Well! A table with a board at the end to keep the\nglasses from falling off is required, then a special stove is needed, a\npot with three compartments for the different degrees of strength of\nthe paste, according as it is to be used for wood, paper, or stuff, a\nparing-knife to cut the cardboard, a mould to adjust it, a hammer to\nnail the steels, pincers, how the devil do I know what all? And all\nthat in order to earn four sous a day! And you have to work fourteen\nhours a day! And each box passes through the workwoman’s hands thirteen\ntimes! And you can’t wet the paper! And you mustn’t spot anything! And\nyou must keep the paste hot. The devil, I tell you! Four sous a day!\nHow do you suppose a man is to live?”\n\n\nAs he spoke, Jondrette did not look at M. Leblanc, who was observing\nhim. M. Leblanc’s eye was fixed on Jondrette, and Jondrette’s eye was\nfixed on the door. Marius’ eager attention was transferred from one to\nthe other. M. Leblanc seemed to be asking himself: “Is this man an\nidiot?” Jondrette repeated two or three distinct times, with all manner\nof varying inflections of the whining and supplicating order: “There is\nnothing left for me but to throw myself into the river! I went down\nthree steps at the side of the bridge of Austerlitz the other day for\nthat purpose.”\n\n\nAll at once his dull eyes lighted up with a hideous flash; the little\nman drew himself up and became terrible, took a step toward M. Leblanc\nand cried in a voice of thunder: “That has nothing to do with the\nquestion! Do you know me?”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX—THE TRAP\n\n\nThe door of the garret had just opened abruptly, and allowed a view of\nthree men clad in blue linen blouses, and masked with masks of black\npaper. The first was thin, and had a long, iron-tipped cudgel; the\nsecond, who was a sort of colossus, carried, by the middle of the\nhandle, with the blade downward, a butcher’s pole-axe for slaughtering\ncattle. The third, a man with thick-set shoulders, not so slender as\nthe first, held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of\nsome prison.\n\nIt appeared that the arrival of these men was what Jondrette had been\nwaiting for. A rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with the\ncudgel, the thin one.\n\n“Is everything ready?” said Jondrette.\n\n“Yes,” replied the thin man.\n\n“Where is Montparnasse?”\n\n\n“The young principal actor stopped to chat with your girl.”\n\n\n“Which?”\n\n\n“The eldest.”\n\n\n“Is there a carriage at the door?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Is the team harnessed?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“With two good horses?”\n\n\n“Excellent.”\n\n\n“Is it waiting where I ordered?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Good,” said Jondrette.\n\nM. Leblanc was very pale. He was scrutinizing everything around him in\nthe den, like a man who understands what he has fallen into, and his\nhead, directed in turn toward all the heads which surrounded him, moved\non his neck with an astonished and attentive slowness, but there was\nnothing in his air which resembled fear. He had improvised an\nintrenchment out of the table; and the man, who but an instant\npreviously, had borne merely the appearance of a kindly old man, had\nsuddenly become a sort of athlete, and placed his robust fist on the\nback of his chair, with a formidable and surprising gesture.\n\nThis old man, who was so firm and so brave in the presence of such a\ndanger, seemed to possess one of those natures which are as courageous\nas they are kind, both easily and simply. The father of a woman whom we\nlove is never a stranger to us. Marius felt proud of that unknown man.\n\nThree of the men, of whom Jondrette had said: “They are\nchimney-builders,” had armed themselves from the pile of old iron, one\nwith a heavy pair of shears, the second with weighing-tongs, the third\nwith a hammer, and had placed themselves across the entrance without\nuttering a syllable. The old man had remained on the bed, and had\nmerely opened his eyes. The Jondrette woman had seated herself beside\nhim.\n\nMarius decided that in a few seconds more the moment for intervention\nwould arrive, and he raised his right hand towards the ceiling, in the\ndirection of the corridor, in readiness to discharge his pistol.\n\nJondrette having terminated his colloquy with the man with the cudgel,\nturned once more to M. Leblanc, and repeated his question, accompanying\nit with that low, repressed, and terrible laugh which was peculiar to\nhim:—\n\n“So you do not recognize me?”\n\n\nM. Leblanc looked him full in the face, and replied:—\n\n“No.”\n\n\nThen Jondrette advanced to the table. He leaned across the candle,\ncrossing his arms, putting his angular and ferocious jaw close to M.\nLeblanc’s calm face, and advancing as far as possible without forcing\nM. Leblanc to retreat, and, in this posture of a wild beast who is\nabout to bite, he exclaimed:—\n\n“My name is not Fabantou, my name is not Jondrette, my name is\nThénardier. I am the inn-keeper of Montfermeil! Do you understand?\nThénardier! Now do you know me?”\n\n\nAn almost imperceptible flush crossed M. Leblanc’s brow, and he replied\nwith a voice which neither trembled nor rose above its ordinary level,\nwith his accustomed placidity:—\n\n“No more than before.”\n\n\nMarius did not hear this reply. Any one who had seen him at that moment\nthrough the darkness would have perceived that he was haggard, stupid,\nthunder-struck. At the moment when Jondrette said: “My name is\nThénardier,” Marius had trembled in every limb, and had leaned against\nthe wall, as though he felt the cold of a steel blade through his\nheart. Then his right arm, all ready to discharge the signal shot,\ndropped slowly, and at the moment when Jondrette repeated, “Thénardier,\ndo you understand?” Marius’s faltering fingers had come near letting\nthe pistol fall. Jondrette, by revealing his identity, had not moved M.\nLeblanc, but he had quite upset Marius. That name of Thénardier, with\nwhich M. Leblanc did not seem to be acquainted, Marius knew well. Let\nthe reader recall what that name meant to him! That name he had worn on\nhis heart, inscribed in his father’s testament! He bore it at the\nbottom of his mind, in the depths of his memory, in that sacred\ninjunction: “A certain Thénardier saved my life. If my son encounters\nhim, he will do him all the good that lies in his power.” That name, it\nwill be remembered, was one of the pieties of his soul; he mingled it\nwith the name of his father in his worship. What! This man was that\nThénardier, that inn-keeper of Montfermeil whom he had so long and so\nvainly sought! He had found him at last, and how? His father’s saviour\nwas a ruffian! That man, to whose service Marius was burning to devote\nhimself, was a monster! That liberator of Colonel Pontmercy was on the\npoint of committing a crime whose scope Marius did not, as yet, clearly\ncomprehend, but which resembled an assassination! And against whom,\ngreat God! what a fatality! What a bitter mockery of fate! His father\nhad commanded him from the depths of his coffin to do all the good in\nhis power to this Thénardier, and for four years Marius had cherished\nno other thought than to acquit this debt of his father’s, and at the\nmoment when he was on the eve of having a brigand seized in the very\nact of crime by justice, destiny cried to him: “This is Thénardier!” He\ncould at last repay this man for his father’s life, saved amid a\nhail-storm of grape-shot on the heroic field of Waterloo, and repay it\nwith the scaffold! He had sworn to himself that if ever he found that\nThénardier, he would address him only by throwing himself at his feet;\nand now he actually had found him, but it was only to deliver him over\nto the executioner! His father said to him: “Succor Thénardier!” And he\nreplied to that adored and sainted voice by crushing Thénardier! He was\nabout to offer to his father in his grave the spectacle of that man who\nhad torn him from death at the peril of his own life, executed on the\nPlace Saint-Jacques through the means of his son, of that Marius to\nwhom he had entrusted that man by his will! And what a mockery to have\nso long worn on his breast his father’s last commands, written in his\nown hand, only to act in so horribly contrary a sense! But, on the\nother hand, now look on that trap and not prevent it! Condemn the\nvictim and to spare the assassin! Could one be held to any gratitude\ntowards so miserable a wretch? All the ideas which Marius had cherished\nfor the last four years were pierced through and through, as it were,\nby this unforeseen blow.\n\nHe shuddered. Everything depended on him. Unknown to themselves, he\nheld in his hand all those beings who were moving about there before\nhis eyes. If he fired his pistol, M. Leblanc was saved, and Thénardier\nlost; if he did not fire, M. Leblanc would be sacrificed, and, who\nknows? Thénardier would escape. Should he dash down the one or allow\nthe other to fall? Remorse awaited him in either case.\n\nWhat was he to do? What should he choose? Be false to the most\nimperious souvenirs, to all those solemn vows to himself, to the most\nsacred duty, to the most venerated text! Should he ignore his father’s\ntestament, or allow the perpetration of a crime! On the one hand, it\nseemed to him that he heard “his Ursule” supplicating for her father\nand on the other, the colonel commending Thénardier to his care. He\nfelt that he was going mad. His knees gave way beneath him. And he had\nnot even the time for deliberation, so great was the fury with which\nthe scene before his eyes was hastening to its catastrophe. It was like\na whirlwind of which he had thought himself the master, and which was\nnow sweeping him away. He was on the verge of swooning.\n\nIn the meantime, Thénardier, whom we shall henceforth call by no other\nname, was pacing up and down in front of the table in a sort of frenzy\nand wild triumph.\n\nHe seized the candle in his fist, and set it on the chimney-piece with\nso violent a bang that the wick came near being extinguished, and the\ntallow bespattered the wall.\n\nThen he turned to M. Leblanc with a horrible look, and spit out these\nwords:—\n\n“Done for! Smoked brown! Cooked! Spitchcocked!”\n\n\nAnd again he began to march back and forth, in full eruption.\n\n“Ah!” he cried, “so I’ve found you again at last, Mister\nphilanthropist! Mister threadbare millionnaire! Mister giver of dolls!\nyou old ninny! Ah! so you don’t recognize me! No, it wasn’t you who\ncame to Montfermeil, to my inn, eight years ago, on Christmas eve,\n1823! It wasn’t you who carried off that Fantine’s child from me! The\nLark! It wasn’t you who had a yellow great-coat! No! Nor a package of\nduds in your hand, as you had this morning here! Say, wife, it seems to\nbe his mania to carry packets of woollen stockings into houses! Old\ncharity monger, get out with you! Are you a hosier, Mister\nmillionnaire? You give away your stock in trade to the poor, holy man!\nWhat bosh! merry Andrew! Ah! and you don’t recognize me? Well, I\nrecognize you, that I do! I recognized you the very moment you poked\nyour snout in here. Ah! you’ll find out presently, that it isn’t all\nroses to thrust yourself in that fashion into people’s houses, under\nthe pretext that they are taverns, in wretched clothes, with the air of\na poor man, to whom one would give a sou, to deceive persons, to play\nthe generous, to take away their means of livelihood, and to make\nthreats in the woods, and you can’t call things quits because\nafterwards, when people are ruined, you bring a coat that is too large,\nand two miserable hospital blankets, you old blackguard, you\nchild-stealer!”\n\n\nHe paused, and seemed to be talking to himself for a moment. One would\nhave said that his wrath had fallen into some hole, like the Rhone;\nthen, as though he were concluding aloud the things which he had been\nsaying to himself in a whisper, he smote the table with his fist, and\nshouted:—\n\n“And with his goody-goody air!”\n\n\nAnd, apostrophizing M. Leblanc:—\n\n“Parbleu! You made game of me in the past! You are the cause of all my\nmisfortunes! For fifteen hundred francs you got a girl whom I had, and\nwho certainly belonged to rich people, and who had already brought in a\ngreat deal of money, and from whom I might have extracted enough to\nlive on all my life! A girl who would have made up to me for everything\nthat I lost in that vile cook-shop, where there was nothing but one\ncontinual row, and where, like a fool, I ate up my last farthing! Oh! I\nwish all the wine folks drank in my house had been poison to those who\ndrank it! Well, never mind! Say, now! You must have thought me\nridiculous when you went off with the Lark! You had your cudgel in the\nforest. You were the stronger. Revenge. I’m the one to hold the trumps\nto-day! You’re in a sorry case, my good fellow! Oh, but I can laugh!\nReally, I laugh! Didn’t he fall into the trap! I told him that I was an\nactor, that my name was Fabantou, that I had played comedy with\nMamselle Mars, with Mamselle Muche, that my landlord insisted on being\npaid tomorrow, the 4th of February, and he didn’t even notice that the\n8th of January, and not the 4th of February is the time when the\nquarter runs out! Absurd idiot! And the four miserable Philippes which\nhe has brought me! Scoundrel! He hadn’t the heart even to go as high as\na hundred francs! And how he swallowed my platitudes! That did amuse\nme. I said to myself: ‘Blockhead! Come, I’ve got you! I lick your paws\nthis morning, but I’ll gnaw your heart this evening!’”\n\n\nThénardier paused. He was out of breath. His little, narrow chest\npanted like a forge bellows. His eyes were full of the ignoble\nhappiness of a feeble, cruel, and cowardly creature, which finds that\nit can, at last, harass what it has feared, and insult what it has\nflattered, the joy of a dwarf who should be able to set his heel on the\nhead of Goliath, the joy of a jackal which is beginning to rend a sick\nbull, so nearly dead that he can no longer defend himself, but\nsufficiently alive to suffer still.\n\nM. Leblanc did not interrupt him, but said to him when he paused:—\n\n“I do not know what you mean to say. You are mistaken in me. I am a\nvery poor man, and anything but a millionnaire. I do not know you. You\nare mistaking me for some other person.”\n\n\n“Ah!” roared Thénardier hoarsely, “a pretty lie! You stick to that\npleasantry, do you! You’re floundering, my old buck! Ah! You don’t\nremember! You don’t see who I am?”\n\n\n“Excuse me, sir,” said M. Leblanc with a politeness of accent, which at\nthat moment seemed peculiarly strange and powerful, “I see that you are\na villain!”\n\n\nWho has not remarked the fact that odious creatures possess a\nsusceptibility of their own, that monsters are ticklish! At this word\n“villain,” the female Thénardier sprang from the bed, Thénardier\ngrasped his chair as though he were about to crush it in his hands.\n“Don’t you stir!” he shouted to his wife; and, turning to M. Leblanc:—\n\n“Villain! Yes, I know that you call us that, you rich gentlemen! Stop!\nit’s true that I became bankrupt, that I am in hiding, that I have no\nbread, that I have not a single sou, that I am a villain! It’s three\ndays since I have had anything to eat, so I’m a villain! Ah! you folks\nwarm your feet, you have Sakoski boots, you have wadded great-coats,\nlike archbishops, you lodge on the first floor in houses that have\nporters, you eat truffles, you eat asparagus at forty francs the bunch\nin the month of January, and green peas, you gorge yourselves, and when\nyou want to know whether it is cold, you look in the papers to see what\nthe engineer Chevalier’s thermometer says about it. We, it is we who\nare thermometers. We don’t need to go out and look on the quay at the\ncorner of the Tour de l’Horologe, to find out the number of degrees of\ncold; we feel our blood congealing in our veins, and the ice forming\nround our hearts, and we say: ‘There is no God!’ And you come to our\ncaverns, yes our caverns, for the purpose of calling us villains! But\nwe’ll devour you! But we’ll devour you, poor little things! Just see\nhere, Mister millionnaire: I have been a solid man, I have held a\nlicense, I have been an elector, I am a bourgeois, that I am! And it’s\nquite possible that you are not!”\n\n\nHere Thénardier took a step towards the men who stood near the door,\nand added with a shudder:—\n\n“When I think that he has dared to come here and talk to me like a\ncobbler!”\n\n\nThen addressing M. Leblanc with a fresh outburst of frenzy:—\n\n“And listen to this also, Mister philanthropist! I’m not a suspicious\ncharacter, not a bit of it! I’m not a man whose name nobody knows, and\nwho comes and abducts children from houses! I’m an old French soldier,\nI ought to have been decorated! I was at Waterloo, so I was! And in the\nbattle I saved a general called the Comte of I don’t know what. He told\nme his name, but his beastly voice was so weak that I didn’t hear. All\nI caught was Merci [thanks]. I’d rather have had his name than his\nthanks. That would have helped me to find him again. The picture that\nyou see here, and which was painted by David at Bruqueselles,—do you\nknow what it represents? It represents me. David wished to immortalize\nthat feat of prowess. I have that general on my back, and I am carrying\nhim through the grape-shot. There’s the history of it! That general\nnever did a single thing for me; he was no better than the rest! But\nnonetheless, I saved his life at the risk of my own, and I have the\ncertificate of the fact in my pocket! I am a soldier of Waterloo, by\nall the furies! And now that I have had the goodness to tell you all\nthis, let’s have an end of it. I want money, I want a deal of money, I\nmust have an enormous lot of money, or I’ll exterminate you, by the\nthunder of the good God!”\n\n\nMarius had regained some measure of control over his anguish, and was\nlistening. The last possibility of doubt had just vanished. It\ncertainly was the Thénardier of the will. Marius shuddered at that\nreproach of ingratitude directed against his father, and which he was\non the point of so fatally justifying. His perplexity was redoubled.\n\nMoreover, there was in all these words of Thénardier, in his accent, in\nhis gesture, in his glance which darted flames at every word, there\nwas, in this explosion of an evil nature disclosing everything, in that\nmixture of braggadocio and abjectness, of pride and pettiness, of rage\nand folly, in that chaos of real griefs and false sentiments, in that\nimmodesty of a malicious man tasting the voluptuous delights of\nviolence, in that shameless nudity of a repulsive soul, in that\nconflagration of all sufferings combined with all hatreds, something\nwhich was as hideous as evil, and as heart-rending as the truth.\n\nThe picture of the master, the painting by David which he had proposed\nthat M. Leblanc should purchase, was nothing else, as the reader has\ndivined, than the sign of his tavern painted, as it will be remembered,\nby himself, the only relic which he had preserved from his shipwreck at\nMontfermeil.\n\nAs he had ceased to intercept Marius’ visual ray, Marius could examine\nthis thing, and in the daub, he actually did recognize a battle, a\nbackground of smoke, and a man carrying another man. It was the group\ncomposed of Pontmercy and Thénardier; the sergeant the rescuer, the\ncolonel rescued. Marius was like a drunken man; this picture restored\nhis father to life in some sort; it was no longer the signboard of the\nwine-shop at Montfermeil, it was a resurrection; a tomb had yawned, a\nphantom had risen there. Marius heard his heart beating in his temples,\nhe had the cannon of Waterloo in his ears, his bleeding father, vaguely\ndepicted on that sinister panel terrified him, and it seemed to him\nthat the misshapen spectre was gazing intently at him.\n\nWhen Thénardier had recovered his breath, he turned his bloodshot eyes\non M. Leblanc, and said to him in a low, curt voice:—\n\n“What have you to say before we put the handcuffs on you?”\n\n\nM. Leblanc held his peace.\n\nIn the midst of this silence, a cracked voice launched this lugubrious\nsarcasm from the corridor:—\n\n“If there’s any wood to be split, I’m there!”\n\n\nIt was the man with the axe, who was growing merry.\n\nAt the same moment, an enormous, bristling, and clayey face made its\nappearance at the door, with a hideous laugh which exhibited not teeth,\nbut fangs.\n\nIt was the face of the man with the butcher’s axe.\n\n“Why have you taken off your mask?” cried Thénardier in a rage.\n\n“For fun,” retorted the man.\n\nFor the last few minutes M. Leblanc had appeared to be watching and\nfollowing all the movements of Thénardier, who, blinded and dazzled by\nhis own rage, was stalking to and fro in the den with full confidence\nthat the door was guarded, and of holding an unarmed man fast, he being\narmed himself, of being nine against one, supposing that the female\nThénardier counted for but one man.\n\nDuring his address to the man with the pole-axe, he had turned his back\nto M. Leblanc.\n\nM. Leblanc seized this moment, overturned the chair with his foot and\nthe table with his fist, and with one bound, with prodigious agility,\nbefore Thénardier had time to turn round, he had reached the window. To\nopen it, to scale the frame, to bestride it, was the work of a second\nonly. He was half out when six robust fists seized him and dragged him\nback energetically into the hovel. These were the three\n“chimney-builders,” who had flung themselves upon him. At the same time\nthe Thénardier woman had wound her hands in his hair.\n\nAt the trampling which ensued, the other ruffians rushed up from the\ncorridor. The old man on the bed, who seemed under the influence of\nwine, descended from the pallet and came reeling up, with a\nstone-breaker’s hammer in his hand.\n\nOne of the “chimney-builders,” whose smirched face was lighted up by\nthe candle, and in whom Marius recognized, in spite of his daubing,\nPanchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, lifted above M.\nLeblanc’s head a sort of bludgeon made of two balls of lead, at the two\nends of a bar of iron.\n\nMarius could not resist this sight. “My father,” he thought, “forgive\nme!”\n\n\nAnd his finger sought the trigger of his pistol.\n\nThe shot was on the point of being discharged when Thénardier’s voice\nshouted:—\n\n“Don’t harm him!”\n\n\nThis desperate attempt of the victim, far from exasperating Thénardier,\nhad calmed him. There existed in him two men, the ferocious man and the\nadroit man. Up to that moment, in the excess of his triumph in the\npresence of the prey which had been brought down, and which did not\nstir, the ferocious man had prevailed; when the victim struggled and\ntried to resist, the adroit man reappeared and took the upper hand.\n\n“Don’t hurt him!” he repeated, and without suspecting it, his first\nsuccess was to arrest the pistol in the act of being discharged, and to\nparalyze Marius, in whose opinion the urgency of the case disappeared,\nand who, in the face of this new phase, saw no inconvenience in waiting\na while longer.\n\nWho knows whether some chance would not arise which would deliver him\nfrom the horrible alternative of allowing Ursule’s father to perish, or\nof destroying the colonel’s saviour?\n\nA herculean struggle had begun. With one blow full in the chest, M.\nLeblanc had sent the old man tumbling, rolling in the middle of the\nroom, then with two backward sweeps of his hand he had overthrown two\nmore assailants, and he held one under each of his knees; the wretches\nwere rattling in the throat beneath this pressure as under a granite\nmillstone; but the other four had seized the formidable old man by both\narms and the back of his neck, and were holding him doubled up over the\ntwo “chimney-builders” on the floor.\n\nThus, the master of some and mastered by the rest, crushing those\nbeneath him and stifling under those on top of him, endeavoring in vain\nto shake off all the efforts which were heaped upon him, M. Leblanc\ndisappeared under the horrible group of ruffians like the wild boar\nbeneath a howling pile of dogs and hounds.\n\nThey succeeded in overthrowing him upon the bed nearest the window, and\nthere they held him in awe. The Thénardier woman had not released her\nclutch on his hair.\n\n“Don’t you mix yourself up in this affair,” said Thénardier. “You’ll\ntear your shawl.”\n\n\nThe Thénardier obeyed, as the female wolf obeys the male wolf, with a\ngrowl.\n\n“Now,” said Thénardier, “search him, you other fellows!”\n\n\nM. Leblanc seemed to have renounced the idea of resistance.\n\nThey searched him.\n\nHe had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing six\nfrancs, and his handkerchief.\n\nThénardier put the handkerchief into his own pocket.\n\n“What! No pocket-book?” he demanded.\n\n“No, nor watch,” replied one of the “chimney-builders.”\n\n\n“Never mind,” murmured the masked man who carried the big key, in the\nvoice of a ventriloquist, “he’s a tough old fellow.”\n\n\nThénardier went to the corner near the door, picked up a bundle of\nropes and threw them at the men.\n\n“Tie him to the leg of the bed,” said he.\n\nAnd, catching sight of the old man who had been stretched across the\nroom by the blow from M. Leblanc’s fist, and who made no movement, he\nadded:—\n\n“Is Boulatruelle dead?”\n\n\n“No,” replied Bigrenaille, “he’s drunk.”\n\n\n“Sweep him into a corner,” said Thénardier.\n\nTwo of the “chimney-builders” pushed the drunken man into the corner\nnear the heap of old iron with their feet.\n\n“Babet,” said Thénardier in a low tone to the man with the cudgel, “why\ndid you bring so many; they were not needed.”\n\n\n“What can you do?” replied the man with the cudgel, “they all wanted to\nbe in it. This is a bad season. There’s no business going on.”\n\n\nThe pallet on which M. Leblanc had been thrown was a sort of hospital\nbed, elevated on four coarse wooden legs, roughly hewn.\n\nM. Leblanc let them take their own course.\n\nThe ruffians bound him securely, in an upright attitude, with his feet\non the ground at the head of the bed, the end which was most remote\nfrom the window, and nearest to the fireplace.\n\nWhen the last knot had been tied, Thénardier took a chair and seated\nhimself almost facing M. Leblanc.\n\nThénardier no longer looked like himself; in the course of a few\nmoments his face had passed from unbridled violence to tranquil and\ncunning sweetness.\n\nMarius found it difficult to recognize in that polished smile of a man\nin official life the almost bestial mouth which had been foaming but a\nmoment before; he gazed with amazement on that fantastic and alarming\nmetamorphosis, and he felt as a man might feel who should behold a\ntiger converted into a lawyer.\n\n“Monsieur—” said Thénardier.\n\nAnd dismissing with a gesture the ruffians who still kept their hands\non M. Leblanc:—\n\n“Stand off a little, and let me have a talk with the gentleman.”\n\n\nAll retired towards the door.\n\nHe went on:—\n\n“Monsieur, you did wrong to try to jump out of the window. You might\nhave broken your leg. Now, if you will permit me, we will converse\nquietly. In the first place, I must communicate to you an observation\nwhich I have made which is, that you have not uttered the faintest\ncry.”\n\n\nThénardier was right, this detail was correct, although it had escaped\nMarius in his agitation. M. Leblanc had barely pronounced a few words,\nwithout raising his voice, and even during his struggle with the six\nruffians near the window he had preserved the most profound and\nsingular silence.\n\nThénardier continued:—\n\n“Mon Dieu! You might have shouted ‘stop thief’ a bit, and I should not\nhave thought it improper. ‘Murder!’ That, too, is said occasionally,\nand, so far as I am concerned, I should not have taken it in bad part.\nIt is very natural that you should make a little row when you find\nyourself with persons who don’t inspire you with sufficient confidence.\nYou might have done that, and no one would have troubled you on that\naccount. You would not even have been gagged. And I will tell you why.\nThis room is very private. That’s its only recommendation, but it has\nthat in its favor. You might fire off a mortar and it would produce\nabout as much noise at the nearest police station as the snores of a\ndrunken man. Here a cannon would make a _boum_, and the thunder would\nmake a _pouf_. It’s a handy lodging. But, in short, you did not shout,\nand it is better so. I present you my compliments, and I will tell you\nthe conclusion that I draw from that fact: My dear sir, when a man\nshouts, who comes? The police. And after the police? Justice. Well! You\nhave not made an outcry; that is because you don’t care to have the\npolice and the courts come in any more than we do. It is because,—I\nhave long suspected it,—you have some interest in hiding something. On\nour side we have the same interest. So we can come to an\nunderstanding.”\n\n\nAs he spoke thus, it seemed as though Thénardier, who kept his eyes\nfixed on M. Leblanc, were trying to plunge the sharp points which\ndarted from the pupils into the very conscience of his prisoner.\nMoreover, his language, which was stamped with a sort of moderated,\nsubdued insolence and crafty insolence, was reserved and almost choice,\nand in that rascal, who had been nothing but a robber a short time\npreviously, one now felt “the man who had studied for the priesthood.”\n\n\nThe silence preserved by the prisoner, that precaution which had been\ncarried to the point of forgetting all anxiety for his own life, that\nresistance opposed to the first impulse of nature, which is to utter a\ncry, all this, it must be confessed, now that his attention had been\ncalled to it, troubled Marius, and affected him with painful\nastonishment.\n\nThénardier’s well-grounded observation still further obscured for\nMarius the dense mystery which enveloped that grave and singular person\non whom Courfeyrac had bestowed the sobriquet of Monsieur Leblanc.\n\nBut whoever he was, bound with ropes, surrounded with executioners,\nhalf plunged, so to speak, in a grave which was closing in upon him to\nthe extent of a degree with every moment that passed, in the presence\nof Thénardier’s wrath, as in the presence of his sweetness, this man\nremained impassive; and Marius could not refrain from admiring at such\na moment the superbly melancholy visage.\n\nHere, evidently, was a soul which was inaccessible to terror, and which\ndid not know the meaning of despair. Here was one of those men who\ncommand amazement in desperate circumstances. Extreme as was the\ncrisis, inevitable as was the catastrophe, there was nothing here of\nthe agony of the drowning man, who opens his horror-filled eyes under\nthe water.\n\nThénardier rose in an unpretending manner, went to the fireplace,\nshoved aside the screen, which he leaned against the neighboring\npallet, and thus unmasked the brazier full of glowing coals, in which\nthe prisoner could plainly see the chisel white-hot and spotted here\nand there with tiny scarlet stars.\n\nThen Thénardier returned to his seat beside M. Leblanc.\n\n“I continue,” said he. “We can come to an understanding. Let us arrange\nthis matter in an amicable way. I was wrong to lose my temper just now,\nI don’t know what I was thinking of, I went a great deal too far, I\nsaid extravagant things. For example, because you are a millionnaire, I\ntold you that I exacted money, a lot of money, a deal of money. That\nwould not be reasonable. Mon Dieu, in spite of your riches, you have\nexpenses of your own—who has not? I don’t want to ruin you, I am not a\ngreedy fellow, after all. I am not one of those people who, because\nthey have the advantage of the position, profit by the fact to make\nthemselves ridiculous. Why, I’m taking things into consideration and\nmaking a sacrifice on my side. I only want two hundred thousand\nfrancs.”\n\n\nM. Leblanc uttered not a word.\n\nThénardier went on:—\n\n“You see that I put not a little water in my wine; I’m very moderate. I\ndon’t know the state of your fortune, but I do know that you don’t\nstick at money, and a benevolent man like yourself can certainly give\ntwo hundred thousand francs to the father of a family who is out of\nluck. Certainly, you are reasonable, too; you haven’t imagined that I\nshould take all the trouble I have to-day and organized this affair\nthis evening, which has been labor well bestowed, in the opinion of\nthese gentlemen, merely to wind up by asking you for enough to go and\ndrink red wine at fifteen sous and eat veal at Desnoyer’s. Two hundred\nthousand francs—it’s surely worth all that. This trifle once out of\nyour pocket, I guarantee you that that’s the end of the matter, and\nthat you have no further demands to fear. You will say to me: ‘But I\nhaven’t two hundred thousand francs about me.’ Oh! I’m not\nextortionate. I don’t demand that. I only ask one thing of you. Have\nthe goodness to write what I am about to dictate to you.”\n\n\nHere Thénardier paused; then he added, emphasizing his words, and\ncasting a smile in the direction of the brazier:—\n\n“I warn you that I shall not admit that you don’t know how to write.”\n\n\nA grand inquisitor might have envied that smile.\n\nThénardier pushed the table close to M. Leblanc, and took an inkstand,\na pen, and a sheet of paper from the drawer which he left half open,\nand in which gleamed the long blade of the knife.\n\nHe placed the sheet of paper before M. Leblanc.\n\n“Write,” said he.\n\nThe prisoner spoke at last.\n\n“How do you expect me to write? I am bound.”\n\n\n“That’s true, excuse me!” ejaculated Thénardier, “you are quite right.”\n\n\nAnd turning to Bigrenaille:—\n\n“Untie the gentleman’s right arm.”\n\n\nPanchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, executed Thénardier’s\norder.\n\nWhen the prisoner’s right arm was free, Thénardier dipped the pen in\nthe ink and presented it to him.\n\n“Understand thoroughly, sir, that you are in our power, at our\ndiscretion, that no human power can get you out of this, and that we\nshall be really grieved if we are forced to proceed to disagreeable\nextremities. I know neither your name, nor your address, but I warn\nyou, that you will remain bound until the person charged with carrying\nthe letter which you are about to write shall have returned. Now, be so\ngood as to write.”\n\n\n“What?” demanded the prisoner.\n\n“I will dictate.”\n\n\nM. Leblanc took the pen.\n\nThénardier began to dictate:—\n\n“My daughter—”\n\n\nThe prisoner shuddered, and raised his eyes to Thénardier.\n\n“Put down ‘My dear daughter’—” said Thénardier.\n\nM. Leblanc obeyed.\n\nThénardier continued:—\n\n“Come instantly—”\n\n\nHe paused:—\n\n“You address her as _thou_, do you not?”\n\n\n“Who?” asked M. Leblanc.\n\n“Parbleu!” cried Thénardier, “the little one, the Lark.”\n\n\nM. Leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion:—\n\n“I do not know what you mean.”\n\n\n“Go on, nevertheless,” ejaculated Thénardier, and he continued to\ndictate:—\n\n“Come immediately, I am in absolute need of thee. The person who will\ndeliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct thee to me. I am\nwaiting for thee. Come with confidence.”\n\n\nM. Leblanc had written the whole of this.\n\nThénardier resumed:—\n\n“Ah! erase ‘come with confidence’; that might lead her to suppose that\neverything was not as it should be, and that distrust is possible.”\n\n\nM. Leblanc erased the three words.\n\n“Now,” pursued Thénardier, “sign it. What’s your name?”\n\n\nThe prisoner laid down the pen and demanded:—\n\n“For whom is this letter?”\n\n\n“You know well,” retorted Thénardier, “for the little one I just told\nyou so.”\n\n\nIt was evident that Thénardier avoided naming the young girl in\nquestion. He said “the Lark,” he said “the little one,” but he did not\npronounce her name—the precaution of a clever man guarding his secret\nfrom his accomplices. To mention the name was to deliver the whole\n“affair” into their hands, and to tell them more about it than there\nwas any need of their knowing.\n\nHe went on:—\n\n“Sign. What is your name?”\n\n\n“Urbain Fabre,” said the prisoner.\n\nThénardier, with the movement of a cat, dashed his hand into his pocket\nand drew out the handkerchief which had been seized on M. Leblanc. He\nlooked for the mark on it, and held it close to the candle.\n\n“U. F. That’s it. Urbain Fabre. Well, sign it U. F.”\n\n\nThe prisoner signed.\n\n“As two hands are required to fold the letter, give it to me, I will\nfold it.”\n\n\nThat done, Thénardier resumed:—\n\n“Address it, ‘Mademoiselle Fabre,’ at your house. I know that you live\na long distance from here, near Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, because you\ngo to mass there every day, but I don’t know in what street. I see that\nyou understand your situation. As you have not lied about your name,\nyou will not lie about your address. Write it yourself.”\n\n\nThe prisoner paused thoughtfully for a moment, then he took the pen and\nwrote:—\n\n“Mademoiselle Fabre, at M. Urbain Fabre’s, Rue Saint-Dominique-D’Enfer,\nNo. 17.”\n\n\nThénardier seized the letter with a sort of feverish convulsion.\n\n“Wife!” he cried.\n\nThe Thénardier woman hastened to him.\n\n“Here’s the letter. You know what you have to do. There is a carriage\nat the door. Set out at once, and return ditto.”\n\n\nAnd addressing the man with the meat-axe:—\n\n“Since you have taken off your nose-screen, accompany the mistress. You\nwill get up behind the fiacre. You know where you left the team?”\n\n\n“Yes,” said the man.\n\nAnd depositing his axe in a corner, he followed Madame Thénardier.\n\nAs they set off, Thénardier thrust his head through the half-open door,\nand shouted into the corridor:—\n\n“Above all things, don’t lose the letter! remember that you carry two\nhundred thousand francs with you!”\n\n\nThe Thénardier’s hoarse voice replied:—\n\n“Be easy. I have it in my bosom.”\n\n\nA minute had not elapsed, when the sound of the cracking of a whip was\nheard, which rapidly retreated and died away.\n\n“Good!” growled Thénardier. “They’re going at a fine pace. At such a\ngallop, the bourgeoise will be back inside three-quarters of an hour.”\n\n\nHe drew a chair close to the fireplace, folding his arms, and\npresenting his muddy boots to the brazier.\n\n“My feet are cold!” said he.\n\nOnly five ruffians now remained in the den with Thénardier and the\nprisoner.\n\nThese men, through the black masks or paste which covered their faces,\nand made of them, at fear’s pleasure, charcoal-burners, negroes, or\ndemons, had a stupid and gloomy air, and it could be felt that they\nperpetrated a crime like a bit of work, tranquilly, without either\nwrath or mercy, with a sort of ennui. They were crowded together in one\ncorner like brutes, and remained silent.\n\nThénardier warmed his feet.\n\nThe prisoner had relapsed into his taciturnity. A sombre calm had\nsucceeded to the wild uproar which had filled the garret but a few\nmoments before.\n\nThe candle, on which a large “stranger” had formed, cast but a dim\nlight in the immense hovel, the brazier had grown dull, and all those\nmonstrous heads cast misshapen shadows on the walls and ceiling.\n\nNo sound was audible except the quiet breathing of the old drunken man,\nwho was fast asleep.\n\nMarius waited in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle.\nThe enigma was more impenetrable than ever.\n\nWho was this “little one” whom Thénardier had called the Lark? Was she\nhis “Ursule”? The prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word,\n“the Lark,” and had replied in the most natural manner in the world: “I\ndo not know what you mean.” On the other hand, the two letters U. F.\nwere explained; they meant Urbain Fabre; and Ursule was no longer named\nUrsule. This was what Marius perceived most clearly of all.\n\nA sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post, from which\nhe was observing and commanding this whole scene. There he stood,\nalmost incapable of movement or reflection, as though annihilated by\nthe abominable things viewed at such close quarters. He waited, in the\nhope of some incident, no matter of what nature, since he could not\ncollect his thoughts and did not know upon what course to decide.\n\n“In any case,” he said, “if she is the Lark, I shall see her, for the\nThénardier woman is to bring her hither. That will be the end, and then\nI will give my life and my blood if necessary, but I will deliver her!\nNothing shall stop me.”\n\n\nNearly half an hour passed in this manner. Thénardier seemed to be\nabsorbed in gloomy reflections, the prisoner did not stir. Still,\nMarius fancied that at intervals, and for the last few moments, he had\nheard a faint, dull noise in the direction of the prisoner.\n\nAll at once, Thénardier addressed the prisoner:\n\n“By the way, Monsieur Fabre, I might as well say it to you at once.”\n\n\nThese few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation. Marius\nstrained his ears.\n\n“My wife will be back shortly, don’t get impatient. I think that the\nLark really is your daughter, and it seems to me quite natural that you\nshould keep her. Only, listen to me a bit. My wife will go and hunt her\nup with your letter. I told my wife to dress herself in the way she\ndid, so that your young lady might make no difficulty about following\nher. They will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind.\nSomewhere, outside the barrier, there is a trap harnessed to two very\ngood horses. Your young lady will be taken to it. She will alight from\nthe fiacre. My comrade will enter the other vehicle with her, and my\nwife will come back here to tell us: ‘It’s done.’ As for the young\nlady, no harm will be done to her; the trap will conduct her to a place\nwhere she will be quiet, and just as soon as you have handed over to me\nthose little two hundred thousand francs, she will be returned to you.\nIf you have me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to\nthe Lark, that’s all.”\n\n\nThe prisoner uttered not a syllable. After a pause, Thénardier\ncontinued:—\n\n“It’s very simple, as you see. There’ll be no harm done unless you wish\nthat there should be harm done. I’m telling you how things stand. I\nwarn you so that you may be prepared.”\n\n\nHe paused: the prisoner did not break the silence, and Thénardier\nresumed:—\n\n“As soon as my wife returns and says to me: ‘The Lark is on the way,’\nwe will release you, and you will be free to go and sleep at home. You\nsee that our intentions are not evil.”\n\n\nTerrible images passed through Marius’ mind. What! That young girl whom\nthey were abducting was not to be brought back? One of those monsters\nwas to bear her off into the darkness? Whither? And what if it were\nshe!\n\nIt was clear that it was she. Marius felt his heart stop beating.\n\nWhat was he to do? Discharge the pistol? Place all those scoundrels in\nthe hands of justice? But the horrible man with the meat-axe would,\nnonetheless, be out of reach with the young girl, and Marius reflected\non Thénardier’s words, of which he perceived the bloody significance:\n“If you have me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to\nthe Lark.”\n\n\nNow, it was not alone by the colonel’s testament, it was by his own\nlove, it was by the peril of the one he loved, that he felt himself\nrestrained.\n\nThis frightful situation, which had already lasted above half an hour,\nwas changing its aspect every moment.\n\nMarius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all the\nmost heart-breaking conjectures, seeking hope and finding none.\n\nThe tumult of his thoughts contrasted with the funereal silence of the\nden.\n\nIn the midst of this silence, the door at the bottom of the staircase\nwas heard to open and shut again.\n\nThe prisoner made a movement in his bonds.\n\n“Here’s the bourgeoise,” said Thénardier.\n\nHe had hardly uttered the words, when the Thénardier woman did in fact\nrush hastily into the room, red, panting, breathless, with flaming\neyes, and cried, as she smote her huge hands on her thighs\nsimultaneously:—\n\n“False address!”\n\n\nThe ruffian who had gone with her made his appearance behind her and\npicked up his axe again.\n\nShe resumed:—\n\n“Nobody there! Rue Saint-Dominique, No. 17, no Monsieur Urbain Fabre!\nThey know not what it means!”\n\n\nShe paused, choking, then went on:—\n\n“Monsieur Thénardier! That old fellow has duped you! You are too good,\nyou see! If it had been me, I’d have chopped the beast in four quarters\nto begin with! And if he had acted ugly, I’d have boiled him alive! He\nwould have been obliged to speak, and say where the girl is, and where\nhe keeps his shiners! That’s the way I should have managed matters!\nPeople are perfectly right when they say that men are a deal stupider\nthan women! Nobody at No. 17. It’s nothing but a big carriage gate! No\nMonsieur Fabre in the Rue Saint-Dominique! And after all that racing\nand fee to the coachman and all! I spoke to both the porter and the\nportress, a fine, stout woman, and they know nothing about him!”\n\n\nMarius breathed freely once more.\n\nShe, Ursule or the Lark, he no longer knew what to call her, was safe.\n\nWhile his exasperated wife vociferated, Thénardier had seated himself\non the table.\n\nFor several minutes he uttered not a word, but swung his right foot,\nwhich hung down, and stared at the brazier with an air of savage\nreverie.\n\nFinally, he said to the prisoner, with a slow and singularly ferocious\ntone:\n\n“A false address? What did you expect to gain by that?”\n\n\n“To gain time!” cried the prisoner in a thundering voice, and at the\nsame instant he shook off his bonds; they were cut. The prisoner was\nonly attached to the bed now by one leg.\n\nBefore the seven men had time to collect their senses and dash forward,\nhe had bent down into the fireplace, had stretched out his hand to the\nbrazier, and had then straightened himself up again, and now\nThénardier, the female Thénardier, and the ruffians, huddled in\namazement at the extremity of the hovel, stared at him in stupefaction,\nas almost free and in a formidable attitude, he brandished above his\nhead the red-hot chisel, which emitted a threatening glow.\n\nThe judicial examination to which the ambush in the Gorbeau house\neventually gave rise, established the fact that a large sou piece, cut\nand worked in a peculiar fashion, was found in the garret, when the\npolice made their descent on it. This sou piece was one of those\nmarvels of industry, which are engendered by the patience of the\ngalleys in the shadows and for the shadows, marvels which are nothing\nelse than instruments of escape. These hideous and delicate products of\nwonderful art are to jewellers’ work what the metaphors of slang are to\npoetry. There are Benvenuto Cellinis in the galleys, just as there are\nVillons in language. The unhappy wretch who aspires to deliverance\nfinds means sometimes without tools, sometimes with a common\nwooden-handled knife, to saw a sou into two thin plates, to hollow out\nthese plates without affecting the coinage stamp, and to make a furrow\non the edge of the sou in such a manner that the plates will adhere\nagain. This can be screwed together and unscrewed at will; it is a box.\nIn this box he hides a watch-spring, and this watch-spring, properly\nhandled, cuts good-sized chains and bars of iron. The unfortunate\nconvict is supposed to possess merely a sou; not at all, he possesses\nliberty. It was a large sou of this sort which, during the subsequent\nsearch of the police, was found under the bed near the window. They\nalso found a tiny saw of blue steel which would fit the sou.\n\nIt is probable that the prisoner had this sou piece on his person at\nthe moment when the ruffians searched him, that he contrived to conceal\nit in his hand, and that afterward, having his right hand free, he\nunscrewed it, and used it as a saw to cut the cords which fastened him,\nwhich would explain the faint noise and almost imperceptible movements\nwhich Marius had observed.\n\nAs he had not been able to bend down, for fear of betraying himself, he\nhad not cut the bonds of his left leg.\n\nThe ruffians had recovered from their first surprise.\n\n“Be easy,” said Bigrenaille to Thénardier. “He still holds by one leg,\nand he can’t get away. I’ll answer for that. I tied that paw for him.”\n\n\nIn the meanwhile, the prisoner had begun to speak:—\n\n“You are wretches, but my life is not worth the trouble of defending\nit. When you think that you can make me speak, that you can make me\nwrite what I do not choose to write, that you can make me say what I do\nnot choose to say—”\n\n\nHe stripped up his left sleeve, and added:—\n\n“See here.”\n\n\nAt the same moment he extended his arm, and laid the glowing chisel\nwhich he held in his left hand by its wooden handle on his bare flesh.\n\nThe crackling of the burning flesh became audible, and the odor\npeculiar to chambers of torture filled the hovel.\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nRed Hot Chisel  3b8-20-red-hot-chisel\n\n\nMarius reeled in utter horror, the very ruffians shuddered, hardly a\nmuscle of the old man’s face contracted, and while the red-hot iron\nsank into the smoking wound, impassive and almost august, he fixed on\nThénardier his beautiful glance, in which there was no hatred, and\nwhere suffering vanished in serene majesty.\n\nWith grand and lofty natures, the revolts of the flesh and the senses\nwhen subjected to physical suffering cause the soul to spring forth,\nand make it appear on the brow, just as rebellions among the soldiery\nforce the captain to show himself.\n\n“Wretches!” said he, “have no more fear of me than I have for you!”\n\n\nAnd, tearing the chisel from the wound, he hurled it through the\nwindow, which had been left open; the horrible, glowing tool\ndisappeared into the night, whirling as it flew, and fell far away on\nthe snow.\n\nThe prisoner resumed:—\n\n“Do what you please with me.” He was disarmed.\n\n“Seize him!” said Thénardier.\n\nTwo of the ruffians laid their hands on his shoulder, and the masked\nman with the ventriloquist’s voice took up his station in front of him,\nready to smash his skull at the slightest movement.\n\nAt the same time, Marius heard below him, at the base of the partition,\nbut so near that he could not see who was speaking, this colloquy\nconducted in a low tone:—\n\n“There is only one thing left to do.”\n\n\n“Cut his throat.”\n\n\n“That’s it.”\n\n\nIt was the husband and wife taking counsel together.\n\nThénardier walked slowly towards the table, opened the drawer, and took\nout the knife. Marius fretted with the handle of his pistol.\nUnprecedented perplexity! For the last hour he had had two voices in\nhis conscience, the one enjoining him to respect his father’s\ntestament, the other crying to him to rescue the prisoner. These two\nvoices continued uninterruptedly that struggle which tormented him to\nagony. Up to that moment he had cherished a vague hope that he should\nfind some means of reconciling these two duties, but nothing within the\nlimits of possibility had presented itself.\n\nHowever, the peril was urgent, the last bounds of delay had been\nreached; Thénardier was standing thoughtfully a few paces distant from\nthe prisoner.\n\nMarius cast a wild glance about him, the last mechanical resource of\ndespair. All at once a shudder ran through him.\n\nAt his feet, on the table, a bright ray of light from the full moon\nilluminated and seemed to point out to him a sheet of paper. On this\npaper he read the following line written that very morning, in large\nletters, by the eldest of the Thénardier girls:—\n\n“THE BOBBIES ARE HERE.”\n\n\nAn idea, a flash, crossed Marius’ mind; this was the expedient of which\nhe was in search, the solution of that frightful problem which was\ntorturing him, of sparing the assassin and saving the victim.\n\nHe knelt down on his commode, stretched out his arm, seized the sheet\nof paper, softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall, wrapped the\npaper round it, and tossed the whole through the crevice into the\nmiddle of the den.\n\nIt was high time. Thénardier had conquered his last fears or his last\nscruples, and was advancing on the prisoner.\n\n“Something is falling!” cried the Thénardier woman.\n\n“What is it?” asked her husband.\n\nThe woman darted forward and picked up the bit of plaster. She handed\nit to her husband.\n\n“Where did this come from?” demanded Thénardier.\n\n“Pardie!” ejaculated his wife, “where do you suppose it came from?\nThrough the window, of course.”\n\n\n“I saw it pass,” said Bigrenaille.\n\nThénardier rapidly unfolded the paper and held it close to the candle.\n\n“It’s in Éponine’s handwriting. The devil!”\n\n\nHe made a sign to his wife, who hastily drew near, and showed her the\nline written on the sheet of paper, then he added in a subdued voice:—\n\n“Quick! The ladder! Let’s leave the bacon in the mousetrap and decamp!”\n\n\n“Without cutting that man’s throat?” asked, the Thénardier woman.\n\n“We haven’t the time.”\n\n\n“Through what?” resumed Bigrenaille.\n\n“Through the window,” replied Thénardier. “Since Ponine has thrown the\nstone through the window, it indicates that the house is not watched on\nthat side.”\n\n\nThe mask with the ventriloquist’s voice deposited his huge key on the\nfloor, raised both arms in the air, and opened and clenched his fists,\nthree times rapidly without uttering a word.\n\nThis was the signal like the signal for clearing the decks for action\non board ship.\n\nThe ruffians who were holding the prisoner released him; in the\ntwinkling of an eye the rope ladder was unrolled outside the window,\nand solidly fastened to the sill by the two iron hooks.\n\nThe prisoner paid no attention to what was going on around him. He\nseemed to be dreaming or praying.\n\nAs soon as the ladder was arranged, Thénardier cried:\n\n“Come! the bourgeoise first!”\n\n\nAnd he rushed headlong to the window.\n\nBut just as he was about to throw his leg over, Bigrenaille seized him\nroughly by the collar.\n\n“Not much, come now, you old dog, after us!”\n\n\n“After us!” yelled the ruffians.\n\n“You are children,” said Thénardier, “we are losing time. The police\nare on our heels.”\n\n\n“Well,” said the ruffians, “let’s draw lots to see who shall go down\nfirst.”\n\n\nThénardier exclaimed:—\n\n“Are you mad! Are you crazy! What a pack of boobies! You want to waste\ntime, do you? Draw lots, do you? By a wet finger, by a short straw!\nWith written names! Thrown into a hat!—”\n\n\n“Would you like my hat?” cried a voice on the threshold.\n\nAll wheeled round. It was Javert.\n\nHe had his hat in his hand, and was holding it out to them with a\nsmile.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI—ONE SHOULD ALWAYS BEGIN BY ARRESTING THE VICTIMS\n\n\nAt nightfall, Javert had posted his men and had gone into ambush\nhimself between the trees of the Rue de la Barrière-des-Gobelins which\nfaced the Gorbeau house, on the other side of the boulevard. He had\nbegun operations by opening “his pockets,” and dropping into it the two\nyoung girls who were charged with keeping a watch on the approaches to\nthe den. But he had only “caged” Azelma. As for Éponine, she was not at\nher post, she had disappeared, and he had not been able to seize her.\nThen Javert had made a point and had bent his ear to waiting for the\nsignal agreed upon. The comings and goings of the fiacres had greatly\nagitated him. At last, he had grown impatient, and, _sure that there\nwas a nest there_, sure of being in “luck,” having recognized many of\nthe ruffians who had entered, he had finally decided to go upstairs\nwithout waiting for the pistol-shot.\n\nIt will be remembered that he had Marius’ pass-key.\n\nHe had arrived just in the nick of time.\n\nThe terrified ruffians flung themselves on the arms which they had\nabandoned in all the corners at the moment of flight. In less than a\nsecond, these seven men, horrible to behold, had grouped themselves in\nan attitude of defence, one with his meat-axe, another with his key,\nanother with his bludgeon, the rest with shears, pincers, and hammers.\nThénardier had his knife in his fist. The Thénardier woman snatched up\nan enormous paving-stone which lay in the angle of the window and\nserved her daughters as an ottoman.\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nSnatched up a Paving Stone  3b8-21-paving-stone\n\n\nJavert put on his hat again, and advanced a couple of paces into the\nroom, with arms folded, his cane under one arm, his sword in its\nsheath.\n\n“Halt there,” said he. “You shall not go out by the window, you shall\ngo through the door. It’s less unhealthy. There are seven of you, there\nare fifteen of us. Don’t let’s fall to collaring each other like men of\nAuvergne.”\n\n\nBigrenaille drew out a pistol which he had kept concealed under his\nblouse, and put it in Thénardier’s hand, whispering in the latter’s\near:—\n\n“It’s Javert. I don’t dare fire at that man. Do you dare?”\n\n\n“Parbleu!” replied Thénardier.\n\n“Well, then, fire.”\n\n\nThénardier took the pistol and aimed at Javert.\n\nJavert, who was only three paces from him, stared intently at him and\ncontented himself with saying:—\n\n“Come now, don’t fire. You’ll miss fire.”\n\n\nThénardier pulled the trigger. The pistol missed fire.\n\n“Didn’t I tell you so!” ejaculated Javert.\n\nBigrenaille flung his bludgeon at Javert’s feet.\n\n“You’re the emperor of the fiends! I surrender.”\n\n\n“And you?” Javert asked the rest of the ruffians.\n\nThey replied:—\n\n“So do we.”\n\n\nJavert began again calmly:—\n\n“That’s right, that’s good, I said so, you are nice fellows.”\n\n\n“I only ask one thing,” said Bigrenaille, “and that is, that I may not\nbe denied tobacco while I am in confinement.”\n\n\n“Granted,” said Javert.\n\nAnd turning round and calling behind him:—\n\n“Come in now!”\n\n\nA squad of policemen, sword in hand, and agents armed with bludgeons\nand cudgels, rushed in at Javert’s summons. They pinioned the ruffians.\n\nThis throng of men, sparely lighted by the single candle, filled the\nden with shadows.\n\n“Handcuff them all!” shouted Javert.\n\n“Come on!” cried a voice which was not the voice of a man, but of which\nno one would ever have said: “It is a woman’s voice.”\n\n\nThe Thénardier woman had entrenched herself in one of the angles of the\nwindow, and it was she who had just given vent to this roar.\n\nThe policemen and agents recoiled.\n\nShe had thrown off her shawl, but retained her bonnet; her husband, who\nwas crouching behind her, was almost hidden under the discarded shawl,\nand she was shielding him with her body, as she elevated the\npaving-stone above her head with the gesture of a giantess on the point\nof hurling a rock.\n\n“Beware!” she shouted.\n\nAll crowded back towards the corridor. A broad open space was cleared\nin the middle of the garret.\n\nThe Thénardier woman cast a glance at the ruffians who had allowed\nthemselves to be pinioned, and muttered in hoarse and guttural\naccents:—\n\n“The cowards!”\n\n\nJavert smiled, and advanced across the open space which the Thénardier\nwas devouring with her eyes.\n\n“Don’t come near me,” she cried, “or I’ll crush you.”\n\n\n“What a grenadier!” ejaculated Javert; “you’ve got a beard like a man,\nmother, but I have claws like a woman.”\n\n\nAnd he continued to advance.\n\nThe Thénardier, dishevelled and terrible, set her feet far apart, threw\nherself backwards, and hurled the paving-stone at Javert’s head. Javert\nducked, the stone passed over him, struck the wall behind, knocked off\na huge piece of plastering, and, rebounding from angle to angle across\nthe hovel, now luckily almost empty, rested at Javert’s feet.\n\nAt the same moment, Javert reached the Thénardier couple. One of his\nbig hands descended on the woman’s shoulder; the other on the husband’s\nhead.\n\n“The handcuffs!” he shouted.\n\nThe policemen trooped in in force, and in a few seconds Javert’s order\nhad been executed.\n\nThe Thénardier female, overwhelmed, stared at her pinioned hands, and\nat those of her husband, who had dropped to the floor, and exclaimed,\nweeping:—\n\n“My daughters!”\n\n\n“They are in the jug,” said Javert.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the agents had caught sight of the drunken man asleep\nbehind the door, and were shaking him:—\n\nHe awoke, stammering:—\n\n“Is it all over, Jondrette?”\n\n\n“Yes,” replied Javert.\n\nThe six pinioned ruffians were standing, and still preserved their\nspectral mien; all three besmeared with black, all three masked.\n\n“Keep on your masks,” said Javert.\n\nAnd passing them in review with a glance of a Frederick II. at a\nPotsdam parade, he said to the three “chimney-builders”:—\n\n“Good day, Bigrenaille! good day, Brujon! good day, Deuxmilliards!”\n\n\nThen turning to the three masked men, he said to the man with the\nmeat-axe:—\n\n“Good day, Gueulemer!”\n\n\nAnd to the man with the cudgel:—\n\n“Good day, Babet!”\n\n\nAnd to the ventriloquist:—\n\n“Your health, Claquesous.”\n\n\nAt that moment, he caught sight of the ruffians’ prisoner, who, ever\nsince the entrance of the police, had not uttered a word, and had held\nhis head down.\n\n“Untie the gentleman!” said Javert, “and let no one go out!”\n\n\nThat said, he seated himself with sovereign dignity before the table,\nwhere the candle and the writing-materials still remained, drew a\nstamped paper from his pocket, and began to prepare his report.\n\nWhen he had written the first lines, which are formulas that never\nvary, he raised his eyes:—\n\n“Let the gentleman whom these gentlemen bound step forward.”\n\n\nThe policemen glanced round them.\n\n“Well,” said Javert, “where is he?”\n\n\nThe prisoner of the ruffians, M. Leblanc, M. Urbain Fabre, the father\nof Ursule or the Lark, had disappeared.\n\nThe door was guarded, but the window was not. As soon as he had found\nhimself released from his bonds, and while Javert was drawing up his\nreport, he had taken advantage of confusion, the crowd, the darkness,\nand of a moment when the general attention was diverted from him, to\ndash out of the window.\n\nAn agent sprang to the opening and looked out. He saw no one outside.\n\nThe rope ladder was still shaking.\n\n“The devil!” ejaculated Javert between his teeth, “he must have been\nthe most valuable of the lot.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII—THE LITTLE ONE WHO WAS CRYING IN VOLUME TWO\n\n\nOn the day following that on which these events took place in the house\non the Boulevard de l’Hôpital, a child, who seemed to be coming from\nthe direction of the bridge of Austerlitz, was ascending the side-alley\non the right in the direction of the Barrière de Fontainebleau.\n\nNight had fully come.\n\nThis lad was pale, thin, clad in rags, with linen trousers in the month\nof February, and was singing at the top of his voice.\n\nAt the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, a bent old woman was\nrummaging in a heap of refuse by the light of a street lantern; the\nchild jostled her as he passed, then recoiled, exclaiming:—\n\n“Hello! And I took it for an enormous, enormous dog!”\n\n\nHe pronounced the word _enormous_ the second time with a jeering swell\nof the voice which might be tolerably well represented by capitals: “an\nenormous, ENORMOUS dog.”\n\n\nThe old woman straightened herself up in a fury.\n\n“Nasty brat!” she grumbled. “If I hadn’t been bending over, I know well\nwhere I would have planted my foot on you.”\n\n\nThe boy was already far away.\n\n“Kisss! kisss!” he cried. “After that, I don’t think I was mistaken!”\n\n\nThe old woman, choking with indignation, now rose completely upright,\nand the red gleam of the lantern fully lighted up her livid face, all\nhollowed into angles and wrinkles, with crow’s-feet meeting the corners\nof her mouth.\n\nHer body was lost in the darkness, and only her head was visible. One\nwould have pronounced her a mask of Decrepitude carved out by a light\nfrom the night.\n\nThe boy surveyed her.\n\n“Madame,” said he, “does not possess that style of beauty which pleases\nme.”\n\n\nHe then pursued his road, and resumed his song:—\n\n“Le roi Coupdesabot\nS’en allait à la chasse,\nÀ la chasse aux corbeaux—”\n\n\nAt the end of these three lines he paused. He had arrived in front of\nNo. 50-52, and finding the door fastened, he began to assault it with\nresounding and heroic kicks, which betrayed rather the man’s shoes that\nhe was wearing than the child’s feet which he owned.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the very old woman whom he had encountered at the\ncorner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier hastened up behind him, uttering\nclamorous cries and indulging in lavish and exaggerated gestures.\n\n“What’s this? What’s this? Lord God! He’s battering the door down! He’s\nknocking the house down.”\n\n\nThe kicks continued.\n\nThe old woman strained her lungs.\n\n“Is that the way buildings are treated nowadays?”\n\n\nAll at once she paused.\n\nShe had recognized the gamin.\n\n“What! so it’s that imp!”\n\n\n“Why, it’s the old lady,” said the lad. “Good day, Bougonmuche. I have\ncome to see my ancestors.”\n\n\nThe old woman retorted with a composite grimace, and a wonderful\nimprovisation of hatred taking advantage of feebleness and ugliness,\nwhich was, unfortunately, wasted in the dark:—\n\n“There’s no one here.”\n\n\n“Bah!” retorted the boy, “where’s my father?”\n\n\n“At La Force.”\n\n\n“Come, now! And my mother?”\n\n\n“At Saint-Lazare.”\n\n\n“Well! And my sisters?”\n\n\n“At the Madelonettes.”\n\n\nThe lad scratched his head behind his ear, stared at Ma’am Bougon, and\nsaid:—\n\n“Ah!”\n\n\nThen he executed a pirouette on his heel; a moment later, the old\nwoman, who had remained on the door-step, heard him singing in his\nclear, young voice, as he plunged under the black elm-trees, in the\nwintry wind:—\n\n“Le roi Coupdesabot\nS’en allait à la chasse,\nÀ la chasse aux corbeaux,\nMonté sur deux échasses.\nQuand on passait dessous,\nOn lui payait deux sous.\"31\n\n\n[THE END OF VOLUME III “MARIUS”]\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME IV—SAINT-DENIS\n\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nFrontispiece Volume Four\n\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nTitlepage Volume Four\n\n\nTHE IDYL IN THE RUE PLUMET AND THE EPIC IN THE RUE SAINT-DENIS\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIRST—A FEW PAGES OF HISTORY\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—WELL CUT\n\n\n1831 and 1832, the two years which are immediately connected with the\nRevolution of July, form one of the most peculiar and striking moments\nof history. These two years rise like two mountains midway between\nthose which precede and those which follow them. They have a\nrevolutionary grandeur. Precipices are to be distinguished there. The\nsocial masses, the very assizes of civilization, the solid group of\nsuperposed and adhering interests, the century-old profiles of the\nancient French formation, appear and disappear in them every instant,\nathwart the storm clouds of systems, of passions, and of theories.\nThese appearances and disappearances have been designated as movement\nand resistance. At intervals, truth, that daylight of the human soul,\ncan be descried shining there.\n\nThis remarkable epoch is decidedly circumscribed and is beginning to be\nsufficiently distant from us to allow of our grasping the principal\nlines even at the present day.\n\nWe shall make the attempt.\n\nThe Restoration had been one of those intermediate phases, hard to\ndefine, in which there is fatigue, buzzing, murmurs, sleep, tumult, and\nwhich are nothing else than the arrival of a great nation at a\nhalting-place.\n\nThese epochs are peculiar and mislead the politicians who desire to\nconvert them to profit. In the beginning, the nation asks nothing but\nrepose; it thirsts for but one thing, peace; it has but one ambition,\nto be small. Which is the translation of remaining tranquil. Of great\nevents, great hazards, great adventures, great men, thank God, we have\nseen enough, we have them heaped higher than our heads. We would\nexchange Cæsar for Prusias, and Napoleon for the King of Yvetot. “What\na good little king was he!” We have marched since daybreak, we have\nreached the evening of a long and toilsome day; we have made our first\nchange with Mirabeau, the second with Robespierre, the third with\nBonaparte; we are worn out. Each one demands a bed.\n\nDevotion which is weary, heroism which has grown old, ambitions which\nare sated, fortunes which are made, seek, demand, implore, solicit,\nwhat? A shelter. They have it. They take possession of peace, of\ntranquillity, of leisure; behold, they are content. But, at the same\ntime certain facts arise, compel recognition, and knock at the door in\ntheir turn. These facts are the products of revolutions and wars, they\nare, they exist, they have the right to install themselves in society,\nand they do install themselves therein; and most of the time, facts are\nthe stewards of the household and fouriers32 who do nothing but prepare\nlodgings for principles.\n\nThis, then, is what appears to philosophical politicians:—\n\nAt the same time that weary men demand repose, accomplished facts\ndemand guarantees. Guarantees are the same to facts that repose is to\nmen.\n\nThis is what England demanded of the Stuarts after the Protector; this\nis what France demanded of the Bourbons after the Empire.\n\nThese guarantees are a necessity of the times. They must be accorded.\nPrinces “grant” them, but in reality, it is the force of things which\ngives them. A profound truth, and one useful to know, which the Stuarts\ndid not suspect in 1662 and which the Bourbons did not even obtain a\nglimpse of in 1814.\n\nThe predestined family, which returned to France when Napoleon fell,\nhad the fatal simplicity to believe that it was itself which bestowed,\nand that what it had bestowed it could take back again; that the House\nof Bourbon possessed the right divine, that France possessed nothing,\nand that the political right conceded in the charter of Louis XVIII.\nwas merely a branch of the right divine, was detached by the House of\nBourbon and graciously given to the people until such day as it should\nplease the King to reassume it. Still, the House of Bourbon should have\nfelt, from the displeasure created by the gift, that it did not come\nfrom it.\n\nThis house was churlish to the nineteenth century. It put on an\nill-tempered look at every development of the nation. To make use of a\ntrivial word, that is to say, of a popular and a true word, it looked\nglum. The people saw this.\n\nIt thought it possessed strength because the Empire had been carried\naway before it like a theatrical stage-setting. It did not perceive\nthat it had, itself, been brought in in the same fashion. It did not\nperceive that it also lay in that hand which had removed Napoleon.\n\nIt thought that it had roots, because it was the past. It was mistaken;\nit formed a part of the past, but the whole past was France. The roots\nof French society were not fixed in the Bourbons, but in the nations.\nThese obscure and lively roots constituted, not the right of a family,\nbut the history of a people. They were everywhere, except under the\nthrone.\n\nThe House of Bourbon was to France the illustrious and bleeding knot in\nher history, but was no longer the principal element of her destiny,\nand the necessary base of her politics. She could get along without the\nBourbons; she had done without them for two and twenty years; there had\nbeen a break of continuity; they did not suspect the fact. And how\nshould they have suspected it, they who fancied that Louis XVII.\nreigned on the 9th of Thermidor, and that Louis XVIII. was reigning at\nthe battle of Marengo? Never, since the origin of history, had princes\nbeen so blind in the presence of facts and the portion of divine\nauthority which facts contain and promulgate. Never had that pretension\nhere below which is called the right of kings denied to such a point\nthe right from on high.\n\nA capital error which led this family to lay its hand once more on the\nguarantees “granted” in 1814, on the concessions, as it termed them.\nSad. A sad thing! What it termed its concessions were our conquests;\nwhat it termed our encroachments were our rights.\n\nWhen the hour seemed to it to have come, the Restoration, supposing\nitself victorious over Bonaparte and well-rooted in the country, that\nis to say, believing itself to be strong and deep, abruptly decided on\nits plan of action, and risked its stroke. One morning it drew itself\nup before the face of France, and, elevating its voice, it contested\nthe collective title and the individual right of the nation to\nsovereignty, of the citizen to liberty. In other words, it denied to\nthe nation that which made it a nation, and to the citizen that which\nmade him a citizen.\n\nThis is the foundation of those famous acts which are called the\nordinances of July. The Restoration fell.\n\nIt fell justly. But, we admit, it had not been absolutely hostile to\nall forms of progress. Great things had been accomplished, with it\nalongside.\n\nUnder the Restoration, the nation had grown accustomed to calm\ndiscussion, which had been lacking under the Republic, and to grandeur\nin peace, which had been wanting under the Empire. France free and\nstrong had offered an encouraging spectacle to the other peoples of\nEurope. The Revolution had had the word under Robespierre; the cannon\nhad had the word under Bonaparte; it was under Louis XVIII. and Charles\nX. that it was the turn of intelligence to have the word. The wind\nceased, the torch was lighted once more. On the lofty heights, the pure\nlight of mind could be seen flickering. A magnificent, useful, and\ncharming spectacle. For a space of fifteen years, those great\nprinciples which are so old for the thinker, so new for the statesman,\ncould be seen at work in perfect peace, on the public square; equality\nbefore the law, liberty of conscience, liberty of speech, liberty of\nthe press, the accessibility of all aptitudes to all functions. Thus it\nproceeded until 1830. The Bourbons were an instrument of civilization\nwhich broke in the hands of Providence.\n\nThe fall of the Bourbons was full of grandeur, not on their side, but\non the side of the nation. They quitted the throne with gravity, but\nwithout authority; their descent into the night was not one of those\nsolemn disappearances which leave a sombre emotion in history; it was\nneither the spectral calm of Charles I., nor the eagle scream of\nNapoleon. They departed, that is all. They laid down the crown, and\nretained no aureole. They were worthy, but they were not august. They\nlacked, in a certain measure, the majesty of their misfortune. Charles\nX. during the voyage from Cherbourg, causing a round table to be cut\nover into a square table, appeared to be more anxious about imperilled\netiquette than about the crumbling monarchy. This diminution saddened\ndevoted men who loved their persons, and serious men who honored their\nrace. The populace was admirable. The nation, attacked one morning with\nweapons, by a sort of royal insurrection, felt itself in the possession\nof so much force that it did not go into a rage. It defended itself,\nrestrained itself, restored things to their places, the government to\nlaw, the Bourbons to exile, alas! and then halted! It took the old king\nCharles X. from beneath that dais which had sheltered Louis XIV. and\nset him gently on the ground. It touched the royal personages only with\nsadness and precaution. It was not one man, it was not a few men, it\nwas France, France entire, France victorious and intoxicated with her\nvictory, who seemed to be coming to herself, and who put into practice,\nbefore the eyes of the whole world, these grave words of Guillaume du\nVair after the day of the Barricades:—\n\n“It is easy for those who are accustomed to skim the favors of the\ngreat, and to spring, like a bird from bough to bough, from an\nafflicted fortune to a flourishing one, to show themselves harsh\ntowards their Prince in his adversity; but as for me, the fortune of my\nKings and especially of my afflicted Kings, will always be venerable to\nme.”\n\n\nThe Bourbons carried away with them respect, but not regret. As we have\njust stated, their misfortune was greater than they were. They faded\nout in the horizon.\n\nThe Revolution of July instantly had friends and enemies throughout the\nentire world. The first rushed toward her with joy and enthusiasm, the\nothers turned away, each according to his nature. At the first blush,\nthe princes of Europe, the owls of this dawn, shut their eyes, wounded\nand stupefied, and only opened them to threaten. A fright which can be\ncomprehended, a wrath which can be pardoned. This strange revolution\nhad hardly produced a shock; it had not even paid to vanquished royalty\nthe honor of treating it as an enemy, and of shedding its blood. In the\neyes of despotic governments, who are always interested in having\nliberty calumniate itself, the Revolution of July committed the fault\nof being formidable and of remaining gentle. Nothing, however, was\nattempted or plotted against it. The most discontented, the most\nirritated, the most trembling, saluted it; whatever our egotism and our\nrancor may be, a mysterious respect springs from events in which we are\nsensible of the collaboration of some one who is working above man.\n\nThe Revolution of July is the triumph of right overthrowing the fact. A\nthing which is full of splendor.\n\nRight overthrowing the fact. Hence the brilliancy of the Revolution of\n1830, hence, also, its mildness. Right triumphant has no need of being\nviolent.\n\nRight is the just and the true.\n\nThe property of right is to remain eternally beautiful and pure. The\nfact, even when most necessary to all appearances, even when most\nthoroughly accepted by contemporaries, if it exist only as a fact, and\nif it contain only too little of right, or none at all, is infallibly\ndestined to become, in the course of time, deformed, impure, perhaps,\neven monstrous. If one desires to learn at one blow, to what degree of\nhideousness the fact can attain, viewed at the distance of centuries,\nlet him look at Machiavelli. Machiavelli is not an evil genius, nor a\ndemon, nor a miserable and cowardly writer; he is nothing but the fact.\nAnd he is not only the Italian fact; he is the European fact, the fact\nof the sixteenth century. He seems hideous, and so he is, in the\npresence of the moral idea of the nineteenth.\n\nThis conflict of right and fact has been going on ever since the origin\nof society. To terminate this duel, to amalgamate the pure idea with\nthe humane reality, to cause right to penetrate pacifically into the\nfact and the fact into right, that is the task of sages.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—BADLY SEWED\n\n\nBut the task of sages is one thing, the task of clever men is another.\nThe Revolution of 1830 came to a sudden halt.\n\nAs soon as a revolution has made the coast, the skilful make haste to\nprepare the shipwreck.\n\nThe skilful in our century have conferred on themselves the title of\nStatesmen; so that this word, _statesmen_, has ended by becoming\nsomewhat of a slang word. It must be borne in mind, in fact, that\nwherever there is nothing but skill, there is necessarily pettiness. To\nsay “the skilful” amounts to saying “the mediocre.”\n\n\nIn the same way, to say “statesmen” is sometimes equivalent to saying\n“traitors.” If, then, we are to believe the skilful, revolutions like\nthe Revolution of July are severed arteries; a prompt ligature is\nindispensable. The right, too grandly proclaimed, is shaken. Also,\nright once firmly fixed, the state must be strengthened. Liberty once\nassured, attention must be directed to power.\n\nHere the sages are not, as yet, separated from the skilful, but they\nbegin to be distrustful. Power, very good. But, in the first place,\nwhat is power? In the second, whence comes it? The skilful do not seem\nto hear the murmured objection, and they continue their manœuvres.\n\nAccording to the politicians, who are ingenious in putting the mask of\nnecessity on profitable fictions, the first requirement of a people\nafter a revolution, when this people forms part of a monarchical\ncontinent, is to procure for itself a dynasty. In this way, say they,\npeace, that is to say, time to dress our wounds, and to repair the\nhouse, can be had after a revolution. The dynasty conceals the\nscaffolding and covers the ambulance. Now, it is not always easy to\nprocure a dynasty.\n\nIf it is absolutely necessary, the first man of genius or even the\nfirst man of fortune who comes to hand suffices for the manufacturing\nof a king. You have, in the first case, Napoleon; in the second,\nIturbide.\n\nBut the first family that comes to hand does not suffice to make a\ndynasty. There is necessarily required a certain modicum of antiquity\nin a race, and the wrinkle of the centuries cannot be improvised.\n\nIf we place ourselves at the point of view of the “statesmen,” after\nmaking all allowances, of course, after a revolution, what are the\nqualities of the king which result from it? He may be and it is useful\nfor him to be a revolutionary; that is to say, a participant in his own\nperson in that revolution, that he should have lent a hand to it, that\nhe should have either compromised or distinguished himself therein,\nthat he should have touched the axe or wielded the sword in it.\n\nWhat are the qualities of a dynasty? It should be national; that is to\nsay, revolutionary at a distance, not through acts committed, but by\nreason of ideas accepted. It should be composed of past and be\nhistoric; be composed of future and be sympathetic.\n\nAll this explains why the early revolutions contented themselves with\nfinding a man, Cromwell or Napoleon; and why the second absolutely\ninsisted on finding a family, the House of Brunswick or the House of\nOrleans.\n\nRoyal houses resemble those Indian fig-trees, each branch of which,\nbending over to the earth, takes root and becomes a fig-tree itself.\nEach branch may become a dynasty. On the sole condition that it shall\nbend down to the people.\n\nSuch is the theory of the skilful.\n\nHere, then, lies the great art: to make a little render to success the\nsound of a catastrophe in order that those who profit by it may tremble\nfrom it also, to season with fear every step that is taken, to augment\nthe curve of the transition to the point of retarding progress, to dull\nthat aurora, to denounce and retrench the harshness of enthusiasm, to\ncut all angles and nails, to wad triumph, to muffle up right, to\nenvelop the giant-people in flannel, and to put it to bed very\nspeedily, to impose a diet on that excess of health, to put Hercules on\nthe treatment of a convalescent, to dilute the event with the\nexpedient, to offer to spirits thirsting for the ideal that nectar\nthinned out with a potion, to take one’s precautions against too much\nsuccess, to garnish the revolution with a shade.\n\n1830 practised this theory, already applied to England by 1688.\n\n1830 is a revolution arrested midway. Half of progress, quasi-right.\nNow, logic knows not the “almost,” absolutely as the sun knows not the\ncandle.\n\nWho arrests revolutions half-way? The bourgeoisie?\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the bourgeoisie is interest which has reached satisfaction.\nYesterday it was appetite, to-day it is plenitude, to-morrow it will be\nsatiety.\n\nThe phenomenon of 1814 after Napoleon was reproduced in 1830 after\nCharles X.\n\nThe attempt has been made, and wrongly, to make a class of the\nbourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie is simply the contented portion of the\npeople. The bourgeois is the man who now has time to sit down. A chair\nis not a caste.\n\nBut through a desire to sit down too soon, one may arrest the very\nmarch of the human race. This has often been the fault of the\nbourgeoisie.\n\nOne is not a class because one has committed a fault. Selfishness is\nnot one of the divisions of the social order.\n\nMoreover, we must be just to selfishness. The state to which that part\nof the nation which is called the bourgeoisie aspired after the shock\nof 1830 was not the inertia which is complicated with indifference and\nlaziness, and which contains a little shame; it was not the slumber\nwhich presupposes a momentary forgetfulness accessible to dreams; it\nwas the halt.\n\nThe halt is a word formed of a singular double and almost contradictory\nsense: a troop on the march, that is to say, movement; a stand, that is\nto say, repose.\n\nThe halt is the restoration of forces; it is repose armed and on the\nalert; it is the accomplished fact which posts sentinels and holds\nitself on its guard.\n\nThe halt presupposes the combat of yesterday and the combat of\nto-morrow.\n\nIt is the partition between 1830 and 1848.\n\nWhat we here call combat may also be designated as progress.\n\nThe bourgeoisie then, as well as the statesmen, required a man who\nshould express this word Halt. An Although-Because. A composite\nindividuality, signifying revolution and signifying stability, in other\nterms, strengthening the present by the evident compatibility of the\npast with the future.\n\nThis man was “already found.” His name was Louis Philippe d’Orleans.\n\nThe 221 made Louis Philippe King. Lafayette undertook the coronation.\n\nHe called it _the best of republics_. The town-hall of Paris took the\nplace of the Cathedral of Rheims.\n\nThis substitution of a half-throne for a whole throne was “the work of\n1830.”\n\n\nWhen the skilful had finished, the immense vice of their solution\nbecame apparent. All this had been accomplished outside the bounds of\nabsolute right. Absolute right cried: “I protest!” then, terrible to\nsay, it retired into the darkness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—LOUIS PHILIPPE\n\n\nRevolutions have a terrible arm and a happy hand, they strike firmly\nand choose well. Even incomplete, even debased and abused and reduced\nto the state of a junior revolution like the Revolution of 1830, they\nnearly always retain sufficient providential lucidity to prevent them\nfrom falling amiss. Their eclipse is never an abdication.\n\nNevertheless, let us not boast too loudly; revolutions also may be\ndeceived, and grave errors have been seen.\n\nLet us return to 1830. 1830, in its deviation, had good luck. In the\nestablishment which entitled itself order after the revolution had been\ncut short, the King amounted to more than royalty. Louis Philippe was a\nrare man.\n\nThe son of a father to whom history will accord certain attenuating\ncircumstances, but also as worthy of esteem as that father had been of\nblame; possessing all private virtues and many public virtues; careful\nof his health, of his fortune, of his person, of his affairs, knowing\nthe value of a minute and not always the value of a year; sober,\nserene, peaceable, patient; a good man and a good prince; sleeping with\nhis wife, and having in his palace lackeys charged with the duty of\nshowing the conjugal bed to the bourgeois, an ostentation of the\nregular sleeping-apartment which had become useful after the former\nillegitimate displays of the elder branch; knowing all the languages of\nEurope, and, what is more rare, all the languages of all interests, and\nspeaking them; an admirable representative of the “middle class,” but\noutstripping it, and in every way greater than it; possessing excellent\nsense, while appreciating the blood from which he had sprung, counting\nmost of all on his intrinsic worth, and, on the question of his race,\nvery particular, declaring himself Orleans and not Bourbon; thoroughly\nthe first Prince of the Blood Royal while he was still only a Serene\nHighness, but a frank bourgeois from the day he became king; diffuse in\npublic, concise in private; reputed, but not proved to be a miser; at\nbottom, one of those economists who are readily prodigal at their own\nfancy or duty; lettered, but not very sensitive to letters; a\ngentleman, but not a chevalier; simple, calm, and strong; adored by his\nfamily and his household; a fascinating talker, an undeceived\nstatesman, inwardly cold, dominated by immediate interest, always\ngoverning at the shortest range, incapable of rancor and of gratitude,\nmaking use without mercy of superiority on mediocrity, clever in\ngetting parliamentary majorities to put in the wrong those mysterious\nunanimities which mutter dully under thrones; unreserved, sometimes\nimprudent in his lack of reserve, but with marvellous address in that\nimprudence; fertile in expedients, in countenances, in masks; making\nFrance fear Europe and Europe France! Incontestably fond of his\ncountry, but preferring his family; assuming more domination than\nauthority and more authority than dignity, a disposition which has this\nunfortunate property, that as it turns everything to success, it admits\nof ruse and does not absolutely repudiate baseness, but which has this\nvaluable side, that it preserves politics from violent shocks, the\nstate from fractures, and society from catastrophes; minute, correct,\nvigilant, attentive, sagacious, indefatigable; contradicting himself at\ntimes and giving himself the lie; bold against Austria at Ancona,\nobstinate against England in Spain, bombarding Antwerp, and paying off\nPritchard; singing the Marseillaise with conviction, inaccessible to\ndespondency, to lassitude, to the taste for the beautiful and the\nideal, to daring generosity, to Utopia, to chimæras, to wrath, to\nvanity, to fear; possessing all the forms of personal intrepidity; a\ngeneral at Valmy; a soldier at Jemappes; attacked eight times by\nregicides and always smiling. Brave as a grenadier, courageous as a\nthinker; uneasy only in the face of the chances of a European shaking\nup, and unfitted for great political adventures; always ready to risk\nhis life, never his work; disguising his will in influence, in order\nthat he might be obeyed as an intelligence rather than as a king;\nendowed with observation and not with divination; not very attentive to\nminds, but knowing men, that is to say requiring to see in order to\njudge; prompt and penetrating good sense, practical wisdom, easy\nspeech, prodigious memory; drawing incessantly on this memory, his only\npoint of resemblance with Cæsar, Alexander, and Napoleon; knowing\ndeeds, facts, details, dates, proper names, ignorant of tendencies,\npassions, the diverse geniuses of the crowd, the interior aspirations,\nthe hidden and obscure uprisings of souls, in a word, all that can be\ndesignated as the invisible currents of consciences; accepted by the\nsurface, but little in accord with France lower down; extricating\nhimself by dint of tact; governing too much and not enough; his own\nfirst minister; excellent at creating out of the pettiness of realities\nan obstacle to the immensity of ideas; mingling a genuine creative\nfaculty of civilization, of order and organization, an indescribable\nspirit of proceedings and chicanery, the founder and lawyer of a\ndynasty; having something of Charlemagne and something of an attorney;\nin short, a lofty and original figure, a prince who understood how to\ncreate authority in spite of the uneasiness of France, and power in\nspite of the jealousy of Europe. Louis Philippe will be classed among\nthe eminent men of his century, and would be ranked among the most\nillustrious governors of history had he loved glory but a little, and\nif he had had the sentiment of what is great to the same degree as the\nfeeling for what is useful.\n\nLouis Philippe had been handsome, and in his old age he remained\ngraceful; not always approved by the nation, he always was so by the\nmasses; he pleased. He had that gift of charming. He lacked majesty; he\nwore no crown, although a king, and no white hair, although an old man;\nhis manners belonged to the old regime and his habits to the new; a\nmixture of the noble and the bourgeois which suited 1830; Louis\nPhilippe was transition reigning; he had preserved the ancient\npronunciation and the ancient orthography which he placed at the\nservice of opinions modern; he loved Poland and Hungary, but he wrote\n_les Polonois_, and he pronounced _les Hongrais_. He wore the uniform\nof the national guard, like Charles X., and the ribbon of the Legion of\nHonor, like Napoleon.\n\nHe went a little to chapel, not at all to the chase, never to the\nopera. Incorruptible by sacristans, by whippers-in, by ballet-dancers;\nthis made a part of his bourgeois popularity. He had no heart. He went\nout with his umbrella under his arm, and this umbrella long formed a\npart of his aureole. He was a bit of a mason, a bit of a gardener,\nsomething of a doctor; he bled a postilion who had tumbled from his\nhorse; Louis Philippe no more went about without his lancet, than did\nHenri IV. without his poniard. The Royalists jeered at this ridiculous\nking, the first who had ever shed blood with the object of healing.\n\nFor the grievances against Louis Philippe, there is one deduction to be\nmade; there is that which accuses royalty, that which accuses the\nreign, that which accuses the King; three columns which all give\ndifferent totals. Democratic right confiscated, progress becomes a\nmatter of secondary interest, the protests of the street violently\nrepressed, military execution of insurrections, the rising passed over\nby arms, the Rue Transnonain, the counsels of war, the absorption of\nthe real country by the legal country, on half shares with three\nhundred thousand privileged persons,—these are the deeds of royalty;\nBelgium refused, Algeria too harshly conquered, and, as in the case of\nIndia by the English, with more barbarism than civilization, the breach\nof faith, to Abd-el-Kader, Blaye, Deutz bought, Pritchard paid,—these\nare the doings of the reign; the policy which was more domestic than\nnational was the doing of the King.\n\nAs will be seen, the proper deduction having been made, the King’s\ncharge is decreased.\n\nThis is his great fault; he was modest in the name of France.\n\nWhence arises this fault?\n\nWe will state it.\n\nLouis Philippe was rather too much of a paternal king; that incubation\nof a family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid of\neverything and does not like to be disturbed; hence excessive timidity,\nwhich is displeasing to the people, who have the 14th of July in their\ncivil and Austerlitz in their military tradition.\n\nMoreover, if we deduct the public duties which require to be fulfilled\nfirst of all, that deep tenderness of Louis Philippe towards his family\nwas deserved by the family. That domestic group was worthy of\nadmiration. Virtues there dwelt side by side with talents. One of Louis\nPhilippe’s daughters, Marie d’Orleans, placed the name of her race\namong artists, as Charles d’Orleans had placed it among poets. She made\nof her soul a marble which she named Jeanne d’Arc. Two of Louis\nPhilippe’s daughters elicited from Metternich this eulogium: “They are\nyoung people such as are rarely seen, and princes such as are never\nseen.”\n\n\nThis, without any dissimulation, and also without any exaggeration, is\nthe truth about Louis Philippe.\n\nTo be Prince Equality, to bear in his own person the contradiction of\nthe Restoration and the Revolution, to have that disquieting side of\nthe revolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power, therein\nlay the fortune of Louis Philippe in 1830; never was there a more\ncomplete adaptation of a man to an event; the one entered into the\nother, and the incarnation took place. Louis Philippe is 1830 made man.\nMoreover, he had in his favor that great recommendation to the throne,\nexile. He had been proscribed, a wanderer, poor. He had lived by his\nown labor. In Switzerland, this heir to the richest princely domains in\nFrance had sold an old horse in order to obtain bread. At Reichenau, he\ngave lessons in mathematics, while his sister Adelaide did wool work\nand sewed. These souvenirs connected with a king rendered the\nbourgeoisie enthusiastic. He had, with his own hands, demolished the\niron cage of Mont-Saint-Michel, built by Louis XI., and used by Louis\nXV. He was the companion of Dumouriez, he was the friend of Lafayette;\nhe had belonged to the Jacobins’ club; Mirabeau had slapped him on the\nshoulder; Danton had said to him: “Young man!” At the age of four and\ntwenty, in ’93, being then M. de Chartres, he had witnessed, from the\ndepth of a box, the trial of Louis XVI., so well named _that poor\ntyrant_. The blind clairvoyance of the Revolution, breaking royalty in\nthe King and the King with royalty, did so almost without noticing the\nman in the fierce crushing of the idea, the vast storm of the\nAssembly-Tribunal, the public wrath interrogating, Capet not knowing\nwhat to reply, the alarming, stupefied vacillation by that royal head\nbeneath that sombre breath, the relative innocence of all in that\ncatastrophe, of those who condemned as well as of the man condemned,—he\nhad looked on those things, he had contemplated that giddiness; he had\nseen the centuries appear before the bar of the Assembly-Convention; he\nhad beheld, behind Louis XVI., that unfortunate passer-by who was made\nresponsible, the terrible culprit, the monarchy, rise through the\nshadows; and there had lingered in his soul the respectful fear of\nthese immense justices of the populace, which are almost as impersonal\nas the justice of God.\n\nThe trace left in him by the Revolution was prodigious. Its memory was\nlike a living imprint of those great years, minute by minute. One day,\nin the presence of a witness whom we are not permitted to doubt, he\nrectified from memory the whole of the letter A in the alphabetical\nlist of the Constituent Assembly.\n\nLouis Philippe was a king of the broad daylight. While he reigned the\npress was free, the tribune was free, conscience and speech were free.\nThe laws of September are open to sight. Although fully aware of the\ngnawing power of light on privileges, he left his throne exposed to the\nlight. History will do justice to him for this loyalty.\n\nLouis Philippe, like all historical men who have passed from the scene,\nis to-day put on his trial by the human conscience. His case is, as\nyet, only in the lower court.\n\nThe hour when history speaks with its free and venerable accent, has\nnot yet sounded for him; the moment has not come to pronounce a\ndefinite judgment on this king; the austere and illustrious historian\nLouis Blanc has himself recently softened his first verdict; Louis\nPhilippe was elected by those two _almosts_ which are called the 221\nand 1830, that is to say, by a half-Parliament, and a half-revolution;\nand in any case, from the superior point of view where philosophy must\nplace itself, we cannot judge him here, as the reader has seen above,\nexcept with certain reservations in the name of the absolute democratic\nprinciple; in the eyes of the absolute, outside these two rights, the\nright of man in the first place, the right of the people in the second,\nall is usurpation; but what we can say, even at the present day, that\nafter making these reserves is, that to sum up the whole, and in\nwhatever manner he is considered, Louis Philippe, taken in himself, and\nfrom the point of view of human goodness, will remain, to use the\nantique language of ancient history, one of the best princes who ever\nsat on a throne.\n\nWhat is there against him? That throne. Take away Louis Philippe the\nking, there remains the man. And the man is good. He is good at times\neven to the point of being admirable. Often, in the midst of his\ngravest souvenirs, after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of\nthe continent, he returned at night to his apartments, and there,\nexhausted with fatigue, overwhelmed with sleep, what did he do? He took\na death sentence and passed the night in revising a criminal suit,\nconsidering it something to hold his own against Europe, but that it\nwas a still greater matter to rescue a man from the executioner. He\nobstinately maintained his opinion against his keeper of the seals; he\ndisputed the ground with the guillotine foot by foot against the crown\nattorneys, those _chatterers of the law_, as he called them. Sometimes\nthe pile of sentences covered his table; he examined them all; it was\nanguish to him to abandon these miserable, condemned heads. One day, he\nsaid to the same witness to whom we have recently referred: “I won\nseven last night.” During the early years of his reign, the death\npenalty was as good as abolished, and the erection of a scaffold was a\nviolence committed against the King. The Grève having disappeared with\nthe elder branch, a bourgeois place of execution was instituted under\nthe name of the Barrière-Saint-Jacques; “practical men” felt the\nnecessity of a quasi-legitimate guillotine; and this was one of the\nvictories of Casimir Périer, who represented the narrow sides of the\nbourgeoisie, over Louis Philippe, who represented its liberal sides.\nLouis Philippe annotated Beccaria with his own hand. After the Fieschi\nmachine, he exclaimed: “What a pity that I was not wounded! Then I\nmight have pardoned!” On another occasion, alluding to the resistance\noffered by his ministry, he wrote in connection with a political\ncriminal, who is one of the most generous figures of our day: “His\npardon is granted; it only remains for me to obtain it.” Louis Philippe\nwas as gentle as Louis IX. and as kindly as Henri IV.\n\nNow, to our mind, in history, where kindness is the rarest of pearls,\nthe man who is kindly almost takes precedence of the man who is great.\n\nLouis Philippe having been severely judged by some, harshly, perhaps,\nby others, it is quite natural that a man, himself a phantom at the\npresent day, who knew that king, should come and testify in his favor\nbefore history; this deposition, whatever else it may be, is evidently\nand above all things, entirely disinterested; an epitaph penned by a\ndead man is sincere; one shade may console another shade; the sharing\nof the same shadows confers the right to praise it; it is not greatly\nto be feared that it will ever be said of two tombs in exile: “This one\nflattered the other.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—CRACKS BENEATH THE FOUNDATION\n\n\nAt the moment when the drama which we are narrating is on the point of\npenetrating into the depths of one of the tragic clouds which envelop\nthe beginning of Louis Philippe’s reign, it was necessary that there\nshould be no equivoque, and it became requisite that this book should\noffer some explanation with regard to this king.\n\nLouis Philippe had entered into possession of his royal authority\nwithout violence, without any direct action on his part, by virtue of a\nrevolutionary change, evidently quite distinct from the real aim of the\nRevolution, but in which he, the Duc d’Orléans, exercised no personal\ninitiative. He had been born a Prince, and he believed himself to have\nbeen elected King. He had not served this mandate on himself; he had\nnot taken it; it had been offered to him, and he had accepted it;\nconvinced, wrongly, to be sure, but convinced nevertheless, that the\noffer was in accordance with right and that the acceptance of it was in\naccordance with duty. Hence his possession was in good faith. Now, we\nsay it in good conscience, Louis Philippe being in possession in\nperfect good faith, and the democracy being in good faith in its\nattack, the amount of terror discharged by the social conflicts weighs\nneither on the King nor on the democracy. A clash of principles\nresembles a clash of elements. The ocean defends the water, the\nhurricane defends the air, the King defends Royalty, the democracy\ndefends the people; the relative, which is the monarchy, resists the\nabsolute, which is the republic; society bleeds in this conflict, but\nthat which constitutes its suffering to-day will constitute its safety\nlater on; and, in any case, those who combat are not to be blamed; one\nof the two parties is evidently mistaken; the right is not, like the\nColossus of Rhodes, on two shores at once, with one foot on the\nrepublic, and one in Royalty; it is indivisible, and all on one side;\nbut those who are in error are so sincerely; a blind man is no more a\ncriminal than a Vendean is a ruffian. Let us, then, impute to the\nfatality of things alone these formidable collisions. Whatever the\nnature of these tempests may be, human irresponsibility is mingled with\nthem.\n\nLet us complete this exposition.\n\nThe government of 1840 led a hard life immediately. Born yesterday, it\nwas obliged to fight to-day.\n\nHardly installed, it was already everywhere conscious of vague\nmovements of traction on the apparatus of July so recently laid, and so\nlacking in solidity.\n\nResistance was born on the morrow; perhaps even, it was born on the\npreceding evening. From month to month the hostility increased, and\nfrom being concealed it became patent.\n\nThe Revolution of July, which gained but little acceptance outside of\nFrance by kings, had been diversely interpreted in France, as we have\nsaid.\n\nGod delivers over to men his visible will in events, an obscure text\nwritten in a mysterious tongue. Men immediately make translations of\nit; translations hasty, incorrect, full of errors, of gaps, and of\nnonsense. Very few minds comprehend the divine language. The most\nsagacious, the calmest, the most profound, decipher slowly, and when\nthey arrive with their text, the task has long been completed; there\nare already twenty translations on the public place. From each\nremaining springs a party, and from each misinterpretation a faction;\nand each party thinks that it alone has the true text, and each faction\nthinks that it possesses the light.\n\nPower itself is often a faction.\n\nThere are, in revolutions, swimmers who go against the current; they\nare the old parties.\n\nFor the old parties who clung to heredity by the grace of God, think\nthat revolutions, having sprung from the right to revolt, one has the\nright to revolt against them. Error. For in these revolutions, the one\nwho revolts is not the people; it is the king. Revolution is precisely\nthe contrary of revolt. Every revolution, being a normal outcome,\ncontains within itself its legitimacy, which false revolutionists\nsometimes dishonor, but which remains even when soiled, which survives\neven when stained with blood.\n\nRevolutions spring not from an accident, but from necessity. A\nrevolution is a return from the fictitious to the real. It is because\nit must be that it is.\n\nNonetheless did the old legitimist parties assail the Revolution of\n1830 with all the vehemence which arises from false reasoning. Errors\nmake excellent projectiles. They strike it cleverly in its vulnerable\nspot, in default of a cuirass, in its lack of logic; they attacked this\nrevolution in its royalty. They shouted to it: “Revolution, why this\nking?” Factions are blind men who aim correctly.\n\nThis cry was uttered equally by the republicans. But coming from them,\nthis cry was logical. What was blindness in the legitimists was\nclearness of vision in the democrats. 1830 had bankrupted the people.\nThe enraged democracy reproached it with this.\n\nBetween the attack of the past and the attack of the future, the\nestablishment of July struggled. It represented the minute at\nloggerheads on the one hand with the monarchical centuries, on the\nother hand with eternal right.\n\nIn addition, and beside all this, as it was no longer revolution and\nhad become a monarchy, 1830 was obliged to take precedence of all\nEurope. To keep the peace, was an increase of complication. A harmony\nestablished contrary to sense is often more onerous than a war. From\nthis secret conflict, always muzzled, but always growling, was born\narmed peace, that ruinous expedient of civilization which in the\nharness of the European cabinets is suspicious in itself. The Royalty\nof July reared up, in spite of the fact that it caught it in the\nharness of European cabinets. Metternich would gladly have put it in\nkicking-straps. Pushed on in France by progress, it pushed on the\nmonarchies, those loiterers in Europe. After having been towed, it\nundertook to tow.\n\nMeanwhile, within her, pauperism, the proletariat, salary, education,\npenal servitude, prostitution, the fate of the woman, wealth, misery,\nproduction, consumption, division, exchange, coin, credit, the rights\nof capital, the rights of labor,—all these questions were multiplied\nabove society, a terrible slope.\n\nOutside of political parties properly so called, another movement\nbecame manifest. Philosophical fermentation replied to democratic\nfermentation. The elect felt troubled as well as the masses; in another\nmanner, but quite as much.\n\nThinkers meditated, while the soil, that is to say, the people,\ntraversed by revolutionary currents, trembled under them with\nindescribably vague epileptic shocks. These dreamers, some isolated,\nothers united in families and almost in communion, turned over social\nquestions in a pacific but profound manner; impassive miners, who\ntranquilly pushed their galleries into the depths of a volcano, hardly\ndisturbed by the dull commotion and the furnaces of which they caught\nglimpses.\n\nThis tranquillity was not the least beautiful spectacle of this\nagitated epoch.\n\nThese men left to political parties the question of rights, they\noccupied themselves with the question of happiness.\n\nThe well-being of man, that was what they wanted to extract from\nsociety.\n\nThey raised material questions, questions of agriculture, of industry,\nof commerce, almost to the dignity of a religion. In civilization, such\nas it has formed itself, a little by the command of God, a great deal\nby the agency of man, interests combine, unite, and amalgamate in a\nmanner to form a veritable hard rock, in accordance with a dynamic law,\npatiently studied by economists, those geologists of politics. These\nmen who grouped themselves under different appellations, but who may\nall be designated by the generic title of socialists, endeavored to\npierce that rock and to cause it to spout forth the living waters of\nhuman felicity.\n\nFrom the question of the scaffold to the question of war, their works\nembraced everything. To the rights of man, as proclaimed by the French\nRevolution, they added the rights of woman and the rights of the child.\n\nThe reader will not be surprised if, for various reasons, we do not\nhere treat in a thorough manner, from the theoretical point of view,\nthe questions raised by socialism. We confine ourselves to indicating\nthem.\n\nAll the problems that the socialists proposed to themselves, cosmogonic\nvisions, reverie and mysticism being cast aside, can be reduced to two\nprincipal problems.\n\nFirst problem: To produce wealth.\n\nSecond problem: To share it.\n\nThe first problem contains the question of work.\n\nThe second contains the question of salary.\n\nIn the first problem the employment of forces is in question.\n\nIn the second, the distribution of enjoyment.\n\nFrom the proper employment of forces results public power.\n\nFrom a good distribution of enjoyments results individual happiness.\n\nBy a good distribution, not an equal but an equitable distribution must\nbe understood.\n\nFrom these two things combined, the public power without, individual\nhappiness within, results social prosperity.\n\nSocial prosperity means the man happy, the citizen free, the nation\ngreat.\n\nEngland solves the first of these two problems. She creates wealth\nadmirably, she divides it badly. This solution which is complete on one\nside only leads her fatally to two extremes: monstrous opulence,\nmonstrous wretchedness. All enjoyments for some, all privations for the\nrest, that is to say, for the people; privilege, exception, monopoly,\nfeudalism, born from toil itself. A false and dangerous situation,\nwhich sates public power or private misery, which sets the roots of the\nState in the sufferings of the individual. A badly constituted grandeur\nin which are combined all the material elements and into which no moral\nelement enters.\n\nCommunism and agrarian law think that they solve the second problem.\nThey are mistaken. Their division kills production. Equal partition\nabolishes emulation; and consequently labor. It is a partition made by\nthe butcher, which kills that which it divides. It is therefore\nimpossible to pause over these pretended solutions. Slaying wealth is\nnot the same thing as dividing it.\n\nThe two problems require to be solved together, to be well solved. The\ntwo problems must be combined and made but one.\n\nSolve only the first of the two problems; you will be Venice, you will\nbe England. You will have, like Venice, an artificial power, or, like\nEngland, a material power; you will be the wicked rich man. You will\ndie by an act of violence, as Venice died, or by bankruptcy, as England\nwill fall. And the world will allow to die and fall all that is merely\nselfishness, all that does not represent for the human race either a\nvirtue or an idea.\n\nIt is well understood here, that by the words Venice, England, we\ndesignate not the peoples, but social structures; the oligarchies\nsuperposed on nations, and not the nations themselves. The nations\nalways have our respect and our sympathy. Venice, as a people, will\nlive again; England, the aristocracy, will fall, but England, the\nnation, is immortal. That said, we continue.\n\nSolve the two problems, encourage the wealthy, and protect the poor,\nsuppress misery, put an end to the unjust farming out of the feeble by\nthe strong, put a bridle on the iniquitous jealousy of the man who is\nmaking his way against the man who has reached the goal, adjust,\nmathematically and fraternally, salary to labor, mingle gratuitous and\ncompulsory education with the growth of childhood, and make of science\nthe base of manliness, develop minds while keeping arms busy, be at one\nand the same time a powerful people and a family of happy men, render\nproperty democratic, not by abolishing it, but by making it universal,\nso that every citizen, without exception, may be a proprietor, an\neasier matter than is generally supposed; in two words, learn how to\nproduce wealth and how to distribute it, and you will have at once\nmoral and material greatness; and you will be worthy to call yourself\nFrance.\n\nThis is what socialism said outside and above a few sects which have\ngone astray; that is what it sought in facts, that is what it sketched\nout in minds.\n\nEfforts worthy of admiration! Sacred attempts!\n\nThese doctrines, these theories, these resistances, the unforeseen\nnecessity for the statesman to take philosophers into account, confused\nevidences of which we catch a glimpse, a new system of politics to be\ncreated, which shall be in accord with the old world without too much\ndisaccord with the new revolutionary ideal, a situation in which it\nbecame necessary to use Lafayette to defend Polignac, the intuition of\nprogress transparent beneath the revolt, the chambers and streets, the\ncompetitions to be brought into equilibrium around him, his faith in\nthe Revolution, perhaps an eventual indefinable resignation born of the\nvague acceptance of a superior definitive right, his desire to remain\nof his race, his domestic spirit, his sincere respect for the people,\nhis own honesty, preoccupied Louis Philippe almost painfully, and there\nwere moments when strong and courageous as he was, he was overwhelmed\nby the difficulties of being a king.\n\nHe felt under his feet a formidable disaggregation, which was not,\nnevertheless, a reduction to dust, France being more France than ever.\n\nPiles of shadows covered the horizon. A strange shade, gradually\ndrawing nearer, extended little by little over men, over things, over\nideas; a shade which came from wraths and systems. Everything which had\nbeen hastily stifled was moving and fermenting. At times the conscience\nof the honest man resumed its breathing, so great was the discomfort of\nthat air in which sophisms were intermingled with truths. Spirits\ntrembled in the social anxiety like leaves at the approach of a storm.\nThe electric tension was such that at certain instants, the first\ncomer, a stranger, brought light. Then the twilight obscurity closed in\nagain. At intervals, deep and dull mutterings allowed a judgment to be\nformed as to the quantity of thunder contained by the cloud.\n\nTwenty months had barely elapsed since the Revolution of July, the year\n1832 had opened with an aspect of something impending and threatening.\n\nThe distress of the people, the laborers without bread, the last Prince\nde Condé engulfed in the shadows, Brussels expelling the Nassaus as\nParis did the Bourbons, Belgium offering herself to a French Prince and\ngiving herself to an English Prince, the Russian hatred of Nicolas,\nbehind us the demons of the South, Ferdinand in Spain, Miguel in\nPortugal, the earth quaking in Italy, Metternich extending his hand\nover Bologna, France treating Austria sharply at Ancona, at the North\nno one knew what sinister sound of the hammer nailing up Poland in her\ncoffin, irritated glances watching France narrowly all over Europe,\nEngland, a suspected ally, ready to give a push to that which was\ntottering and to hurl herself on that which should fall, the peerage\nsheltering itself behind Beccaria to refuse four heads to the law, the\nfleurs-de-lys erased from the King’s carriage, the cross torn from\nNotre Dame, Lafayette lessened, Laffitte ruined, Benjamin Constant dead\nin indigence, Casimir Périer dead in the exhaustion of his power;\npolitical and social malady breaking out simultaneously in the two\ncapitals of the kingdom, the one in the city of thought, the other in\nthe city of toil; at Paris civil war, at Lyons servile war; in the two\ncities, the same glare of the furnace; a crater-like crimson on the\nbrow of the people; the South rendered fanatic, the West troubled, the\nDuchesse de Berry in la Vendée, plots, conspiracies, risings, cholera,\nadded the sombre roar of tumult of events to the sombre roar of ideas.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—FACTS WHENCE HISTORY SPRINGS AND WHICH HISTORY IGNORES\n\n\nTowards the end of April, everything had become aggravated. The\nfermentation entered the boiling state. Ever since 1830, petty partial\nrevolts had been going on here and there, which were quickly\nsuppressed, but ever bursting forth afresh, the sign of a vast\nunderlying conflagration. Something terrible was in preparation.\nGlimpses could be caught of the features still indistinct and\nimperfectly lighted, of a possible revolution. France kept an eye on\nParis; Paris kept an eye on the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.\n\nThe Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which was in a dull glow, was beginning its\nebullition.\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\n4b1-5-street-oratorTH (50K)\n\n\nThe wine-shops of the Rue de Charonne were, although the union of the\ntwo epithets seems singular when applied to wine-shops, grave and\nstormy.\n\nThe government was there purely and simply called in question. There\npeople publicly discussed the _question of fighting or of keeping\nquiet_. There were back shops where workingmen were made to swear that\nthey would hasten into the street at the first cry of alarm, and “that\nthey would fight without counting the number of the enemy.” This\nengagement once entered into, a man seated in the corner of the\nwine-shop “assumed a sonorous tone,” and said, “You understand! You\nhave sworn!”\n\n\nSometimes they went upstairs, to a private room on the first floor, and\nthere scenes that were almost masonic were enacted. They made the\ninitiated take oaths _to render service to himself as well as to the\nfathers of families_. That was the formula.\n\nIn the tap-rooms, “subversive” pamphlets were read. _They treated the\ngovernment with contempt_, says a secret report of that time.\n\nWords like the following could be heard there:—\n\n“I don’t know the names of the leaders. We folks shall not know the day\nuntil two hours beforehand.” One workman said: “There are three hundred\nof us, let each contribute ten sous, that will make one hundred and\nfifty francs with which to procure powder and shot.”\n\n\nAnother said: “I don’t ask for six months, I don’t ask for even two. In\nless than a fortnight we shall be parallel with the government. With\ntwenty-five thousand men we can face them.” Another said: “I don’t\nsleep at night, because I make cartridges all night.” From time to\ntime, men “of bourgeois appearance, and in good coats” came and “caused\nembarrassment,” and with the air of “command,” shook hands with _the\nmost important_, and then went away. They never stayed more than ten\nminutes. Significant remarks were exchanged in a low tone: “The plot is\nripe, the matter is arranged.” “It was murmured by all who were there,”\nto borrow the very expression of one of those who were present. The\nexaltation was such that one day, a workingman exclaimed, before the\nwhole wine-shop: “We have no arms!” One of his comrades replied: “The\nsoldiers have!” thus parodying without being aware of the fact,\nBonaparte’s proclamation to the army in Italy: “When they had anything\nof a more secret nature on hand,” adds one report, “they did not\ncommunicate it to each other.” It is not easy to understand what they\ncould conceal after what they said.\n\nThese reunions were sometimes periodical. At certain ones of them,\nthere were never more than eight or ten persons present, and they were\nalways the same. In others, any one entered who wished, and the room\nwas so full that they were forced to stand. Some went thither through\nenthusiasm and passion; others because it _was on their way to their\nwork_. As during the Revolution, there were patriotic women in some of\nthese wine-shops who embraced newcomers.\n\nOther expressive facts came to light.\n\nA man would enter a shop, drink, and go his way with the remark:\n“Wine-merchant, the revolution will pay what is due to you.”\n\n\nRevolutionary agents were appointed in a wine-shop facing the Rue de\nCharonne. The balloting was carried on in their caps.\n\nWorkingmen met at the house of a fencing-master who gave lessons in the\nRue de Cotte. There there was a trophy of arms formed of wooden\nbroadswords, canes, clubs, and foils. One day, the buttons were removed\nfrom the foils.\n\nA workman said: “There are twenty-five of us, but they don’t count on\nme, because I am looked upon as a machine.” Later on, that machine\nbecame Quenisset.\n\nThe indefinite things which were brewing gradually acquired a strange\nand indescribable notoriety. A woman sweeping off her doorsteps said to\nanother woman: “For a long time, there has been a strong force busy\nmaking cartridges.” In the open street, proclamation could be seen\naddressed to the National Guard in the departments. One of these\nproclamations was signed: _Burtot, wine-merchant_.\n\nOne day a man with his beard worn like a collar and with an Italian\naccent mounted a stone post at the door of a liquor-seller in the\nMarché Lenoir, and read aloud a singular document, which seemed to\nemanate from an occult power. Groups formed around him, and applauded.\n\nThe passages which touched the crowd most deeply were collected and\nnoted down. “—Our doctrines are trammelled, our proclamations torn, our\nbill-stickers are spied upon and thrown into prison.”—“The breakdown\nwhich has recently taken place in cottons has converted to us many\nmediums.”—“The future of nations is being worked out in our obscure\nranks.”—“Here are the fixed terms: action or reaction, revolution or\ncounter-revolution. For, at our epoch, we no longer believe either in\ninertia or in immobility. For the people against the people, that is\nthe question. There is no other.”—“On the day when we cease to suit\nyou, break us, but up to that day, help us to march on.” All this in\nbroad daylight.\n\nOther deeds, more audacious still, were suspicious in the eyes of the\npeople by reason of their very audacity. On the 4th of April, 1832, a\npasser-by mounted the post on the corner which forms the angle of the\nRue Sainte-Marguerite and shouted: “I am a Babouvist!” But beneath\nBabeuf, the people scented Gisquet.\n\nAmong other things, this man said:—\n\n“Down with property! The opposition of the left is cowardly and\ntreacherous. When it wants to be on the right side, it preaches\nrevolution, it is democratic in order to escape being beaten, and\nroyalist so that it may not have to fight. The republicans are beasts\nwith feathers. Distrust the republicans, citizens of the laboring\nclasses.”\n\n\n“Silence, citizen spy!” cried an artisan.\n\nThis shout put an end to the discourse.\n\nMysterious incidents occurred.\n\nAt nightfall, a workingman encountered near the canal a “very well\ndressed man,” who said to him: “Whither are you bound, citizen?” “Sir,”\nreplied the workingman, “I have not the honor of your acquaintance.” “I\nknow you very well, however.” And the man added: “Don’t be alarmed, I\nam an agent of the committee. You are suspected of not being quite\nfaithful. You know that if you reveal anything, there is an eye fixed\non you.” Then he shook hands with the workingman and went away, saying:\n“We shall meet again soon.”\n\n\nThe police, who were on the alert, collected singular dialogues, not\nonly in the wine-shops, but in the street.\n\n“Get yourself received very soon,” said a weaver to a cabinet-maker.\n\n“Why?”\n\n\n“There is going to be a shot to fire.”\n\n\nTwo ragged pedestrians exchanged these remarkable replies, fraught with\nevident Jacquerie:—\n\n“Who governs us?”\n\n\n“M. Philippe.”\n\n\n“No, it is the bourgeoisie.”\n\n\nThe reader is mistaken if he thinks that we take the word _Jacquerie_\nin a bad sense. The Jacques were the poor.\n\nOn another occasion two men were heard to say to each other as they\npassed by: “We have a good plan of attack.”\n\n\nOnly the following was caught of a private conversation between four\nmen who were crouching in a ditch of the circle of the Barrière du\nTrône:—\n\n“Everything possible will be done to prevent his walking about Paris\nany more.”\n\n\nWho was the _he?_ Menacing obscurity.\n\n“The principal leaders,” as they said in the faubourg, held themselves\napart. It was supposed that they met for consultation in a wine-shop\nnear the point Saint-Eustache. A certain Aug—, chief of the Society aid\nfor tailors, Rue Mondétour, had the reputation of serving as\nintermediary central between the leaders and the Faubourg\nSaint-Antoine.\n\nNevertheless, there was always a great deal of mystery about these\nleaders, and no certain fact can invalidate the singular arrogance of\nthis reply made later on by a man accused before the Court of Peers:—\n\n“Who was your leader?”\n\n\n_“I knew of none and I recognized none.”_\n\nThere was nothing but words, transparent but vague; sometimes idle\nreports, rumors, hearsay. Other indications cropped up.\n\nA carpenter, occupied in nailing boards to a fence around the ground on\nwhich a house was in process of construction, in the Rue de Reuilly\nfound on that plot the torn fragment of a letter on which were still\nlegible the following lines:—\n\nThe committee must take measures to prevent recruiting in the sections\nfor the different societies.\n\nAnd, as a postscript:—\n\nWe have learned that there are guns in the Rue du\nFaubourg-Poissonnière, No. 5 [bis], to the number of five or six\nthousand, in the house of a gunsmith in that court. The section owns no\narms.\n\nWhat excited the carpenter and caused him to show this thing to his\nneighbors was the fact, that a few paces further on he picked up\nanother paper, torn like the first, and still more significant, of\nwhich we reproduce a facsimile, because of the historical interest\nattaching to these strange documents:—\n\n\n\nCode Table 4b1-5 Page 26\n\n+——————————————————————————————+\n| Q | C | D | E | Learn this list by heart.  After so doing\n| | | | | | you will tear it up.  The men admitted will do the same\n| | | | | | when you have transmitted their orders to them. Health and\n| | | | | | Fraternity, u og a’ fe L. |\n+——————————————————————————————+\n\nIt was only later on that the persons who were in the secret of this\nfind at the time, learned the significance of those four capital\nletters: _quinturions, centurions, decurions, éclaireurs_ [scouts], and\nthe sense of the letters: _u og a’ fe_, which was a date, and meant\nApril 15th, 1832. Under each capital letter were inscribed names\nfollowed by very characteristic notes. Thus: Q. _Bannerel_. 8 guns, 83\ncartridges. A safe man.—C. _Boubière_. 1 pistol, 40 cartridges.—D.\n_Rollet_. 1 foil, 1 pistol, 1 pound of powder.—E. _Tessier_. 1 sword, 1\ncartridge-box. Exact.— _Terreur_. 8 guns. Brave, etc.\n\nFinally, this carpenter found, still in the same enclosure, a third\npaper on which was written in pencil, but very legibly, this sort of\nenigmatical list:—\n\nUnité:  Blanchard: Arbre-Sec. 6.\nBarra.  Soize.  Salle-au-Comte.\nKosciusko. Aubry the Butcher?\nJ. J. R.\nCaius Gracchus.\nRight of revision.  Dufond.  Four.\nFall of the Girondists.  Derbac.  Maubuée.\nWashington.  Pinson.  1 pistol, 86 cartridges.\nMarseillaise.\nSovereignty of the people. Michel. Quincampoix. Sword.\nHoche.\nMarceau.  Plato.  Arbre-Sec.\nWarsaw.  Tilly, crier of the Populaire.\n\n\nThe honest bourgeois into whose hands this list fell knew its\nsignificance. It appears that this list was the complete nomenclature\nof the sections of the fourth arondissement of the Society of the\nRights of Man, with the names and dwellings of the chiefs of sections.\nTo-day, when all these facts which were obscure are nothing more than\nhistory, we may publish them. It should be added, that the foundation\nof the Society of the Rights of Man seems to have been posterior to the\ndate when this paper was found. Perhaps this was only a rough draft.\n\nStill, according to all the remarks and the words, according to written\nnotes, material facts begin to make their appearance.\n\nIn the Rue Popincourt, in the house of a dealer in bric-à-brac, there\nwere seized seven sheets of gray paper, all folded alike lengthwise and\nin four; these sheets enclosed twenty-six squares of this same gray\npaper folded in the form of a cartridge, and a card, on which was\nwritten the following:—\n\nSaltpetre . . . . . . . . . . .  12 ounces.\nSulphur   . . . . . . . . . . .   2 ounces.\nCharcoal  . . . . . . . . . . .   2 ounces and a half.\nWater     . . . . . . . . . . .   2 ounces.\n\n\nThe report of the seizure stated that the drawer exhaled a strong smell\nof powder.\n\nA mason returning from his day’s work, left behind him a little package\non a bench near the bridge of Austerlitz. This package was taken to the\npolice station. It was opened, and in it were found two printed\ndialogues, signed _Lahautière_, a song entitled: “Workmen, band\ntogether,” and a tin box full of cartridges.\n\nOne artisan drinking with a comrade made the latter feel him to see how\nwarm he was; the other man felt a pistol under his waistcoat.\n\nIn a ditch on the boulevard, between Père-Lachaise and the Barrière du\nTrône, at the most deserted spot, some children, while playing,\ndiscovered beneath a mass of shavings and refuse bits of wood, a bag\ncontaining a bullet-mould, a wooden punch for the preparation of\ncartridges, a wooden bowl, in which there were grains of\nhunting-powder, and a little cast-iron pot whose interior presented\nevident traces of melted lead.\n\nPolice agents, making their way suddenly and unexpectedly at five\no’clock in the morning, into the dwelling of a certain Pardon, who was\nafterwards a member of the Barricade-Merry section and got himself\nkilled in the insurrection of April, 1834, found him standing near his\nbed, and holding in his hand some cartridges which he was in the act of\npreparing.\n\nTowards the hour when workingmen repose, two men were seen to meet\nbetween the Barrière Picpus and the Barrière Charenton in a little lane\nbetween two walls, near a wine-shop, in front of which there was a “Jeu\nde Siam.\"33 One drew a pistol from beneath his blouse and handed it to\nthe other. As he was handing it to him, he noticed that the\nperspiration of his chest had made the powder damp. He primed the\npistol and added more powder to what was already in the pan. Then the\ntwo men parted.\n\nA certain Gallais, afterwards killed in the Rue Beaubourg in the affair\nof April, boasted of having in his house seven hundred cartridges and\ntwenty-four flints.\n\nThe government one day received a warning that arms and two hundred\nthousand cartridges had just been distributed in the faubourg. On the\nfollowing week thirty thousand cartridges were distributed. The\nremarkable point about it was, that the police were not able to seize a\nsingle one.\n\nAn intercepted letter read: “The day is not far distant when, within\nfour hours by the clock, eighty thousand patriots will be under arms.”\n\n\nAll this fermentation was public, one might almost say tranquil. The\napproaching insurrection was preparing its storm calmly in the face of\nthe government. No singularity was lacking to this still subterranean\ncrisis, which was already perceptible. The bourgeois talked peaceably\nto the working-classes of what was in preparation. They said: “How is\nthe rising coming along?” in the same tone in which they would have\nsaid: “How is your wife?”\n\n\nA furniture-dealer, of the Rue Moreau, inquired: “Well, when are you\ngoing to make the attack?”\n\n\nAnother shop-keeper said:—\n\n“The attack will be made soon.”\n\n\n“I know it. A month ago, there were fifteen thousand of you, now there\nare twenty-five thousand.” He offered his gun, and a neighbor offered a\nsmall pistol which he was willing to sell for seven francs.\n\nMoreover, the revolutionary fever was growing. Not a point in Paris nor\nin France was exempt from it. The artery was beating everywhere. Like\nthose membranes which arise from certain inflammations and form in the\nhuman body, the network of secret societies began to spread all over\nthe country. From the associations of the Friends of the People, which\nwas at the same time public and secret, sprang the Society of the\nRights of Man, which also dated from one of the orders of the day:\n_Pluviôse, Year 40 of the republican era_, which was destined to\nsurvive even the mandate of the Court of Assizes which pronounced its\ndissolution, and which did not hesitate to bestow on its sections\nsignificant names like the following:—\n\nPikes.\nTocsin.\nSignal cannon.\nPhrygian cap.\nJanuary 21.\nThe beggars.\nThe vagabonds.\nForward march.\nRobespierre.\nLevel.\nÇa Ira.\n\n\nThe Society of the Rights of Man engendered the Society of Action.\nThese were impatient individuals who broke away and hastened ahead.\nOther associations sought to recruit themselves from the great mother\nsocieties. The members of sections complained that they were torn\nasunder. Thus, the Gallic Society, and the committee of organization of\nthe Municipalities. Thus the associations for the liberty of the press,\nfor individual liberty, for the instruction of the people against\nindirect taxes. Then the Society of Equal Workingmen which was divided\ninto three fractions, the levellers, the communists, the reformers.\nThen the Army of the Bastilles, a sort of cohort organized on a\nmilitary footing, four men commanded by a corporal, ten by a sergeant,\ntwenty by a sub-lieutenant, forty by a lieutenant; there were never\nmore than five men who knew each other. Creation where precaution is\ncombined with audacity and which seemed stamped with the genius of\nVenice.\n\nThe central committee, which was at the head, had two arms, the Society\nof Action, and the Army of the Bastilles.\n\nA legitimist association, the Chevaliers of Fidelity, stirred about\namong these the republican affiliations. It was denounced and\nrepudiated there.\n\nThe Parisian societies had ramifications in the principal cities,\nLyons, Nantes, Lille, Marseilles, and each had its Society of the\nRights of Man, the Charbonnière, and The Free Men. All had a\nrevolutionary society which was called the Cougourde. We have already\nmentioned this word.\n\nIn Paris, the Faubourg Saint-Marceau kept up an equal buzzing with the\nFaubourg Saint-Antoine, and the schools were no less moved than the\nfaubourgs. A café in the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe and the wine-shop of the\n_Seven Billiards_, Rue des Mathurins-Saint-Jacques, served as rallying\npoints for the students. The Society of the Friends of the A B C\naffiliated to the Mutualists of Angers, and to the Cougourde of Aix,\nmet, as we have seen, in the Café Musain. These same young men\nassembled also, as we have stated already, in a restaurant wine-shop of\nthe Rue Mondétour which was called Corinthe. These meetings were\nsecret. Others were as public as possible, and the reader can judge of\ntheir boldness from these fragments of an interrogatory undergone in\none of the ulterior prosecutions: “Where was this meeting held?” “In\nthe Rue de la Paix.” “At whose house?” “In the street.” “What sections\nwere there?” “Only one.” “Which?” “The Manuel section.” “Who was its\nleader?” “I.” “You are too young to have decided alone upon the bold\ncourse of attacking the government. Where did your instructions come\nfrom?” “From the central committee.”\n\n\nThe army was mined at the same time as the population, as was proved\nsubsequently by the operations of Béford, Luneville, and Épinard. They\ncounted on the fifty-second regiment, on the fifth, on the eighth, on\nthe thirty-seventh, and on the twentieth light cavalry. In Burgundy and\nin the southern towns they planted the liberty tree; that is to say, a\npole surmounted by a red cap.\n\nSuch was the situation.\n\nThe Faubourg Saint-Antoine, more than any other group of the\npopulation, as we stated in the beginning, accentuated this situation\nand made it felt. That was the sore point. This old faubourg, peopled\nlike an ant-hill, laborious, courageous, and angry as a hive of bees,\nwas quivering with expectation and with the desire for a tumult.\nEverything was in a state of agitation there, without any interruption,\nhowever, of the regular work. It is impossible to convey an idea of\nthis lively yet sombre physiognomy. In this faubourg exists poignant\ndistress hidden under attic roofs; there also exist rare and ardent\nminds. It is particularly in the matter of distress and intelligence\nthat it is dangerous to have extremes meet.\n\nThe Faubourg Saint-Antoine had also other causes to tremble; for it\nreceived the counter-shock of commercial crises, of failures, strikes,\nslack seasons, all inherent to great political disturbances. In times\nof revolution misery is both cause and effect. The blow which it deals\nrebounds upon it. This population full of proud virtue, capable to the\nhighest degree of latent heat, always ready to fly to arms, prompt to\nexplode, irritated, deep, undermined, seemed to be only awaiting the\nfall of a spark. Whenever certain sparks float on the horizon chased by\nthe wind of events, it is impossible not to think of the Faubourg\nSaint-Antoine and of the formidable chance which has placed at the very\ngates of Paris that powder-house of suffering and ideas.\n\nThe wine-shops of the _Faubourg Antoine_, which have been more than\nonce drawn in the sketches which the reader has just perused, possess\nhistorical notoriety. In troublous times people grow intoxicated there\nmore on words than on wine. A sort of prophetic spirit and an afflatus\nof the future circulates there, swelling hearts and enlarging souls.\nThe cabarets of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine resemble those taverns of\nMont Aventine erected on the cave of the Sibyl and communicating with\nthe profound and sacred breath; taverns where the tables were almost\ntripods, and where was drunk what Ennius calls the _sibylline wine_.\n\nThe Faubourg Saint-Antoine is a reservoir of people. Revolutionary\nagitations create fissures there, through which trickles the popular\nsovereignty. This sovereignty may do evil; it can be mistaken like any\nother; but, even when led astray, it remains great. We may say of it as\nof the blind cyclops, _Ingens_.\n\nIn ’93, according as the idea which was floating about was good or\nevil, according as it was the day of fanaticism or of enthusiasm, there\nleaped forth from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine now savage legions, now\nheroic bands.\n\nSavage. Let us explain this word. When these bristling men, who in the\nearly days of the revolutionary chaos, tattered, howling, wild, with\nuplifted bludgeon, pike on high, hurled themselves upon ancient Paris\nin an uproar, what did they want? They wanted an end to oppression, an\nend to tyranny, an end to the sword, work for men, instruction for the\nchild, social sweetness for the woman, liberty, equality, fraternity,\nbread for all, the idea for all, the Edenizing of the world. Progress;\nand that holy, sweet, and good thing, progress, they claimed in\nterrible wise, driven to extremities as they were, half naked, club in\nfist, a roar in their mouths. They were savages, yes; but the savages\nof civilization.\n\nThey proclaimed right furiously; they were desirous, if only with fear\nand trembling, to force the human race to paradise. They seemed\nbarbarians, and they were saviours. They demanded light with the mask\nof night.\n\nFacing these men, who were ferocious, we admit, and terrifying, but\nferocious and terrifying for good ends, there are other men, smiling,\nembroidered, gilded, beribboned, starred, in silk stockings, in white\nplumes, in yellow gloves, in varnished shoes, who, with their elbows on\na velvet table, beside a marble chimney-piece, insist gently on\ndemeanor and the preservation of the past, of the Middle Ages, of\ndivine right, of fanaticism, of innocence, of slavery, of the death\npenalty, of war, glorifying in low tones and with politeness, the\nsword, the stake, and the scaffold. For our part, if we were forced to\nmake a choice between the barbarians of civilization and the civilized\nmen of barbarism, we should choose the barbarians.\n\nBut, thank Heaven, still another choice is possible. No perpendicular\nfall is necessary, in front any more than in the rear.\n\nNeither despotism nor terrorism. We desire progress with a gentle\nslope.\n\nGod takes care of that. God’s whole policy consists in rendering slopes\nless steep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—ENJOLRAS AND HIS LIEUTENANTS\n\n\nIt was about this epoch that Enjolras, in view of a possible\ncatastrophe, instituted a kind of mysterious census.\n\nAll were present at a secret meeting at the Café Musain.\n\nEnjolras said, mixing his words with a few half-enigmatical but\nsignificant metaphors:—\n\n“It is proper that we should know where we stand and on whom we may\ncount. If combatants are required, they must be provided. It can do no\nharm to have something with which to strike. Passers-by always have\nmore chance of being gored when there are bulls on the road than when\nthere are none. Let us, therefore, reckon a little on the herd. How\nmany of us are there? There is no question of postponing this task\nuntil to-morrow. Revolutionists should always be hurried; progress has\nno time to lose. Let us mistrust the unexpected. Let us not be caught\nunprepared. We must go over all the seams that we have made and see\nwhether they hold fast. This business ought to be concluded to-day.\nCourfeyrac, you will see the polytechnic students. It is their day to\ngo out. To-day is Wednesday. Feuilly, you will see those of the\nGlacière, will you not? Combeferre has promised me to go to Picpus.\nThere is a perfect swarm and an excellent one there. Bahorel will visit\nthe Estrapade. Prouvaire, the masons are growing lukewarm; you will\nbring us news from the lodge of the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honoré. Joly\nwill go to Dupuytren’s clinical lecture, and feel the pulse of the\nmedical school. Bossuet will take a little turn in the court and talk\nwith the young law licentiates. I will take charge of the Cougourde\nmyself.”\n\n\n“That arranges everything,” said Courfeyrac.\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“What else is there?”\n\n\n“A very important thing.”\n\n\n“What is that?” asked Courfeyrac.\n\n“The Barrière du Maine,” replied Enjolras.\n\nEnjolras remained for a moment as though absorbed in reflection, then\nhe resumed:—\n\n“At the Barrière du Maine there are marble-workers, painters, and\njourneymen in the studios of sculptors. They are an enthusiastic\nfamily, but liable to cool off. I don’t know what has been the matter\nwith them for some time past. They are thinking of something else. They\nare becoming extinguished. They pass their time playing dominoes. There\nis urgent need that some one should go and talk with them a little, but\nwith firmness. They meet at Richefeu’s. They are to be found there\nbetween twelve and one o’clock. Those ashes must be fanned into a glow.\nFor that errand I had counted on that abstracted Marius, who is a good\nfellow on the whole, but he no longer comes to us. I need some one for\nthe Barrière du Maine. I have no one.”\n\n\n“What about me?” said Grantaire. “Here am I.”\n\n\n“You?”\n\n\n“I.”\n\n\n“You indoctrinate republicans! you warm up hearts that have grown cold\nin the name of principle!”\n\n\n“Why not?”\n\n\n“Are you good for anything?”\n\n\n“I have a vague ambition in that direction,” said Grantaire.\n\n“You do not believe in everything.”\n\n\n“I believe in you.”\n\n\n“Grantaire will you do me a service?”\n\n\n“Anything. I’ll black your boots.”\n\n\n“Well, don’t meddle with our affairs. Sleep yourself sober from your\nabsinthe.”\n\n\n“You are an ingrate, Enjolras.”\n\n\n“You the man to go to the Barrière du Maine! You capable of it!”\n\n\n“I am capable of descending the Rue de Grès, of crossing the Place\nSaint-Michel, of sloping through the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince, of taking\nthe Rue de Vaugirard, of passing the Carmelites, of turning into the\nRue d’Assas, of reaching the Rue du Cherche-Midi, of leaving behind me\nthe Conseil de Guerre, of pacing the Rue des Vieilles-Tuileries, of\nstriding across the boulevard, of following the Chaussée du Maine, of\npassing the barrier, and entering Richefeu’s. I am capable of that. My\nshoes are capable of that.”\n\n\n“Do you know anything of those comrades who meet at Richefeu’s?”\n\n\n“Not much. We only address each other as _thou_.”\n\n\n“What will you say to them?”\n\n\n“I will speak to them of Robespierre, pardi! Of Danton. Of principles.”\n\n\n“You?”\n\n\n“I. But I don’t receive justice. When I set about it, I am terrible. I\nhave read Prudhomme, I know the Social Contract, I know my constitution\nof the year Two by heart. ‘The liberty of one citizen ends where the\nliberty of another citizen begins.’ Do you take me for a brute? I have\nan old bank-bill of the Republic in my drawer. The Rights of Man, the\nsovereignty of the people, sapristi! I am even a bit of a Hébertist. I\ncan talk the most superb twaddle for six hours by the clock, watch in\nhand.”\n\n\n“Be serious,” said Enjolras.\n\n“I am wild,” replied Grantaire.\n\nEnjolras meditated for a few moments, and made the gesture of a man who\nhas taken a resolution.\n\n“Grantaire,” he said gravely, “I consent to try you. You shall go to\nthe Barrière du Maine.”\n\n\nGrantaire lived in furnished lodgings very near the Café Musain. He\nwent out, and five minutes later he returned. He had gone home to put\non a Robespierre waistcoat.\n\n“Red,” said he as he entered, and he looked intently at Enjolras. Then,\nwith the palm of his energetic hand, he laid the two scarlet points of\nthe waistcoat across his breast.\n\nAnd stepping up to Enjolras, he whispered in his ear:—\n\n“Be easy.”\n\n\nHe jammed his hat on resolutely and departed.\n\nA quarter of an hour later, the back room of the Café Musain was\ndeserted. All the friends of the A B C were gone, each in his own\ndirection, each to his own task. Enjolras, who had reserved the\nCougourde of Aix for himself, was the last to leave.\n\nThose members of the Cougourde of Aix who were in Paris then met on the\nplain of Issy, in one of the abandoned quarries which are so numerous\nin that side of Paris.\n\nAs Enjolras walked towards this place, he passed the whole situation in\nreview in his own mind. The gravity of events was self-evident. When\nfacts, the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady, move heavily,\nthe slightest complication stops and entangles them. A phenomenon\nwhence arises ruin and new births. Enjolras descried a luminous\nuplifting beneath the gloomy skirts of the future. Who knows? Perhaps\nthe moment was at hand. The people were again taking possession of\nright, and what a fine spectacle! The revolution was again majestically\ntaking possession of France and saying to the world: “The sequel\nto-morrow!” Enjolras was content. The furnace was being heated. He had\nat that moment a powder train of friends scattered all over Paris. He\ncomposed, in his own mind, with Combeferre’s philosophical and\npenetrating eloquence, Feuilly’s cosmopolitan enthusiasm, Courfeyrac’s\ndash, Bahorel’s smile, Jean Prouvaire’s melancholy, Joly’s science,\nBossuet’s sarcasms, a sort of electric spark which took fire nearly\neverywhere at once. All hands to work. Surely, the result would answer\nto the effort. This was well. This made him think of Grantaire.\n\n“Hold,” said he to himself, “the Barrière du Maine will not take me far\nout of my way. What if I were to go on as far as Richefeu’s? Let us\nhave a look at what Grantaire is about, and see how he is getting on.”\n\n\nOne o’clock was striking from the Vaugirard steeple when Enjolras\nreached the Richefeu smoking-room.\n\nHe pushed open the door, entered, folded his arms, letting the door\nfall to and strike his shoulders, and gazed at that room filled with\ntables, men, and smoke.\n\nA voice broke forth from the mist of smoke, interrupted by another\nvoice. It was Grantaire holding a dialogue with an adversary.\n\nGrantaire was sitting opposite another figure, at a marble Saint-Anne\ntable, strewn with grains of bran and dotted with dominos. He was\nhammering the table with his fist, and this is what Enjolras heard:—\n\n“Double-six.”\n\n\n“Fours.”\n\n\n“The pig! I have no more.”\n\n\n“You are dead. A two.”\n\n\n“Six.”\n\n\n“Three.”\n\n\n“One.”\n\n\n“It’s my move.”\n\n\n“Four points.”\n\n\n“Not much.”\n\n\n“It’s your turn.”\n\n\n“I have made an enormous mistake.”\n\n\n“You are doing well.”\n\n\n“Fifteen.”\n\n\n“Seven more.”\n\n\n“That makes me twenty-two.” [Thoughtfully, “Twenty-two!”]\n\n“You weren’t expecting that double-six. If I had placed it at the\nbeginning, the whole play would have been changed.”\n\n\n“A two again.”\n\n\n“One.”\n\n\n“One! Well, five.”\n\n\n“I haven’t any.”\n\n\n“It was your play, I believe?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Blank.”\n\n\n“What luck he has! Ah! You are lucky! [Long reverie.] Two.”\n\n\n“One.”\n\n\n“Neither five nor one. That’s bad for you.”\n\n\n“Domino.”\n\n\n“Plague take it!”\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SECOND—ÉPONINE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE LARK’S MEADOW\n\n\nMarius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon\nwhose track he had set Javert; but Javert had no sooner quitted the\nbuilding, bearing off his prisoners in three hackney-coaches, than\nMarius also glided out of the house. It was only nine o’clock in the\nevening. Marius betook himself to Courfeyrac. Courfeyrac was no longer\nthe imperturbable inhabitant of the Latin Quarter, he had gone to live\nin the Rue de la Verrerie “for political reasons”; this quarter was one\nwhere, at that epoch, insurrection liked to install itself. Marius said\nto Courfeyrac: “I have come to sleep with you.” Courfeyrac dragged a\nmattress off his bed, which was furnished with two, spread it out on\nthe floor, and said: “There.”\n\n\nAt seven o’clock on the following morning, Marius returned to the\nhovel, paid the quarter’s rent which he owed to Ma’am Bougon, had his\nbooks, his bed, his table, his commode, and his two chairs loaded on a\nhand-cart and went off without leaving his address, so that when Javert\nreturned in the course of the morning, for the purpose of questioning\nMarius as to the events of the preceding evening, he found only Ma’am\nBougon, who answered: “Moved away!”\n\n\nMa’am Bougon was convinced that Marius was to some extent an accomplice\nof the robbers who had been seized the night before. “Who would ever\nhave said it?” she exclaimed to the portresses of the quarter, “a young\nman like that, who had the air of a girl!”\n\n\nMarius had two reasons for this prompt change of residence. The first\nwas, that he now had a horror of that house, where he had beheld, so\nclose at hand, and in its most repulsive and most ferocious\ndevelopment, a social deformity which is, perhaps, even more terrible\nthan the wicked rich man, the wicked poor man. The second was, that he\ndid not wish to figure in the lawsuit which would insue in all\nprobability, and be brought in to testify against Thénardier.\n\nJavert thought that the young man, whose name he had forgotten, was\nafraid, and had fled, or perhaps, had not even returned home at the\ntime of the ambush; he made some efforts to find him, however, but\nwithout success.\n\nA month passed, then another. Marius was still with Courfeyrac. He had\nlearned from a young licentiate in law, an habitual frequenter of the\ncourts, that Thénardier was in close confinement. Every Monday, Marius\nhad five francs handed in to the clerk’s office of La Force for\nThénardier.\n\nAs Marius had no longer any money, he borrowed the five francs from\nCourfeyrac. It was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowed\nmoney. These periodical five francs were a double riddle to Courfeyrac\nwho lent and to Thénardier who received them. “To whom can they go?”\nthought Courfeyrac. “Whence can this come to me?” Thénardier asked\nhimself.\n\nMoreover, Marius was heart-broken. Everything had plunged through a\ntrap-door once more. He no longer saw anything before him; his life was\nagain buried in mystery where he wandered fumblingly. He had for a\nmoment beheld very close at hand, in that obscurity, the young girl\nwhom he loved, the old man who seemed to be her father, those unknown\nbeings, who were his only interest and his only hope in this world;\nand, at the very moment when he thought himself on the point of\ngrasping them, a gust had swept all these shadows away. Not a spark of\ncertainty and truth had been emitted even in the most terrible of\ncollisions. No conjecture was possible. He no longer knew even the name\nthat he thought he knew. It certainly was not Ursule. And the Lark was\na nickname. And what was he to think of the old man? Was he actually in\nhiding from the police? The white-haired workman whom Marius had\nencountered in the vicinity of the Invalides recurred to his mind. It\nnow seemed probable that that workingman and M. Leblanc were one and\nthe same person. So he disguised himself? That man had his heroic and\nhis equivocal sides. Why had he not called for help? Why had he fled?\nWas he, or was he not, the father of the young girl? Was he, in short,\nthe man whom Thénardier thought that he recognized? Thénardier might\nhave been mistaken. These formed so many insoluble problems. All this,\nit is true, detracted nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl\nof the Luxembourg. Heart-rending distress; Marius bore a passion in his\nheart, and night over his eyes. He was thrust onward, he was drawn, and\nhe could not stir. All had vanished, save love. Of love itself he had\nlost the instincts and the sudden illuminations. Ordinarily, this flame\nwhich burns us lights us also a little, and casts some useful gleams\nwithout. But Marius no longer even heard these mute counsels of\npassion. He never said to himself: “What if I were to go to such a\nplace? What if I were to try such and such a thing?” The girl whom he\ncould no longer call Ursule was evidently somewhere; nothing warned\nMarius in what direction he should seek her. His whole life was now\nsummed up in two words; absolute uncertainty within an impenetrable\nfog. To see her once again; he still aspired to this, but he no longer\nexpected it.\n\nTo crown all, his poverty had returned. He felt that icy breath close\nto him, on his heels. In the midst of his torments, and long before\nthis, he had discontinued his work, and nothing is more dangerous than\ndiscontinued work; it is a habit which vanishes. A habit which is easy\nto get rid of, and difficult to take up again.\n\nA certain amount of dreaming is good, like a narcotic in discreet\ndoses. It lulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor, which are\nsometimes severe, and produces in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor\nwhich corrects the over-harsh contours of pure thought, fills in gaps\nhere and there, binds together and rounds off the angles of the ideas.\nBut too much dreaming sinks and drowns. Woe to the brain-worker who\nallows himself to fall entirely from thought into reverie! He thinks\nthat he can re-ascend with equal ease, and he tells himself that, after\nall, it is the same thing. Error!\n\nThought is the toil of the intelligence, reverie its voluptuousness. To\nreplace thought with reverie is to confound a poison with a food.\n\nMarius had begun in that way, as the reader will remember. Passion had\nsupervened and had finished the work of precipitating him into chimæras\nwithout object or bottom. One no longer emerges from one’s self except\nfor the purpose of going off to dream. Idle production. Tumultuous and\nstagnant gulf. And, in proportion as labor diminishes, needs increase.\nThis is a law. Man, in a state of reverie, is generally prodigal and\nslack; the unstrung mind cannot hold life within close bounds.\n\nThere is, in that mode of life, good mingled with evil, for if\nenervation is baleful, generosity is good and healthful. But the poor\nman who is generous and noble, and who does not work, is lost.\nResources are exhausted, needs crop up.\n\nFatal declivity down which the most honest and the firmest as well as\nthe most feeble and most vicious are drawn, and which ends in one of\ntwo holds, suicide or crime.\n\nBy dint of going outdoors to think, the day comes when one goes out to\nthrow one’s self in the water.\n\nExcess of reverie breeds men like Escousse and Lebras.\n\nMarius was descending this declivity at a slow pace, with his eyes\nfixed on the girl whom he no longer saw. What we have just written\nseems strange, and yet it is true. The memory of an absent being\nkindles in the darkness of the heart; the more it has disappeared, the\nmore it beams; the gloomy and despairing soul sees this light on its\nhorizon; the star of the inner night. She—that was Marius’ whole\nthought. He meditated of nothing else; he was confusedly conscious that\nhis old coat was becoming an impossible coat, and that his new coat was\ngrowing old, that his shirts were wearing out, that his hat was wearing\nout, that his boots were giving out, and he said to himself: “If I\ncould but see her once again before I die!”\n\n\nOne sweet idea alone was left to him, that she had loved him, that her\nglance had told him so, that she did not know his name, but that she\ndid know his soul, and that, wherever she was, however mysterious the\nplace, she still loved him perhaps. Who knows whether she were not\nthinking of him as he was thinking of her? Sometimes, in those\ninexplicable hours such as are experienced by every heart that loves,\nthough he had no reasons for anything but sadness and yet felt an\nobscure quiver of joy, he said to himself: “It is her thoughts that are\ncoming to me!” Then he added: “Perhaps my thoughts reach her also.”\n\n\nThis illusion, at which he shook his head a moment later, was\nsufficient, nevertheless, to throw beams, which at times resembled\nhope, into his soul. From time to time, especially at that evening hour\nwhich is the most depressing to even the dreamy, he allowed the purest,\nthe most impersonal, the most ideal of the reveries which filled his\nbrain, to fall upon a notebook which contained nothing else. He called\nthis “writing to her.”\n\n\nIt must not be supposed that his reason was deranged. Quite the\ncontrary. He had lost the faculty of working and of moving firmly\ntowards any fixed goal, but he was endowed with more clear-sightedness\nand rectitude than ever. Marius surveyed by a calm and real, although\npeculiar light, what passed before his eyes, even the most indifferent\ndeeds and men; he pronounced a just criticism on everything with a sort\nof honest dejection and candid disinterestedness. His judgment, which\nwas almost wholly disassociated from hope, held itself aloof and soared\non high.\n\nIn this state of mind nothing escaped him, nothing deceived him, and\nevery moment he was discovering the foundation of life, of humanity,\nand of destiny. Happy, even in the midst of anguish, is he to whom God\nhas given a soul worthy of love and of unhappiness! He who has not\nviewed the things of this world and the heart of man under this double\nlight has seen nothing and knows nothing of the true.\n\nThe soul which loves and suffers is in a state of sublimity.\n\nHowever, day followed day, and nothing new presented itself. It merely\nseemed to him, that the sombre space which still remained to be\ntraversed by him was growing shorter with every instant. He thought\nthat he already distinctly perceived the brink of the bottomless abyss.\n\n“What!” he repeated to himself, “shall I not see her again before\nthen!”\n\n\nWhen you have ascended the Rue Saint-Jacques, left the barrier on one\nside and followed the old inner boulevard for some distance, you reach\nthe Rue de la Santé, then the Glacière, and, a little while before\narriving at the little river of the Gobelins, you come to a sort of\nfield which is the only spot in the long and monotonous chain of the\nboulevards of Paris, where Ruysdael would be tempted to sit down.\n\nThere is something indescribable there which exhales grace, a green\nmeadow traversed by tightly stretched lines, from which flutter rags\ndrying in the wind, and an old market-gardener’s house, built in the\ntime of Louis XIII., with its great roof oddly pierced with dormer\nwindows, dilapidated palisades, a little water amid poplar-trees,\nwomen, voices, laughter; on the horizon the Panthéon, the pole of the\nDeaf-Mutes, the Val-de-Grâce, black, squat, fantastic, amusing,\nmagnificent, and in the background, the severe square crests of the\ntowers of Notre Dame.\n\nAs the place is worth looking at, no one goes thither. Hardly one cart\nor wagoner passes in a quarter of an hour.\n\nIt chanced that Marius’ solitary strolls led him to this plot of\nground, near the water. That day, there was a rarity on the boulevard,\na passer-by. Marius, vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of\nthe place, asked this passer-by:—“What is the name of this spot?”\n\n\nThe person replied: “It is the Lark’s meadow.”\n\n\nAnd he added: “It was here that Ulbach killed the shepherdess of Ivry.”\n\n\nBut after the word “Lark” Marius heard nothing more. These sudden\ncongealments in the state of reverie, which a single word suffices to\nevoke, do occur. The entire thought is abruptly condensed around an\nidea, and it is no longer capable of perceiving anything else.\n\nThe Lark was the appellation which had replaced Ursule in the depths of\nMarius’ melancholy.—“Stop,” said he with a sort of unreasoning stupor\npeculiar to these mysterious asides, “this is her meadow. I shall know\nwhere she lives now.”\n\n\nIt was absurd, but irresistible.\n\nAnd every day he returned to that meadow of the Lark.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—EMBRYONIC FORMATION OF CRIMES IN THE INCUBATION OF PRISONS\n\n\nJavert’s triumph in the Gorbeau hovel seemed complete, but had not been\nso.\n\nIn the first place, and this constituted the principal anxiety, Javert\nhad not taken the prisoner prisoner. The assassinated man who flees is\nmore suspicious than the assassin, and it is probable that this\npersonage, who had been so precious a capture for the ruffians, would\nbe no less fine a prize for the authorities.\n\nAnd then, Montparnasse had escaped Javert.\n\nAnother opportunity of laying hands on that “devil’s dandy” must be\nwaited for. Montparnasse had, in fact, encountered Éponine as she stood\non the watch under the trees of the boulevard, and had led her off,\npreferring to play Nemorin with the daughter rather than Schinderhannes\nwith the father. It was well that he did so. He was free. As for\nÉponine, Javert had caused her to be seized; a mediocre consolation.\nÉponine had joined Azelma at Les Madelonettes.\n\nAnd finally, on the way from the Gorbeau house to La Force, one of the\nprincipal prisoners, Claquesous, had been lost. It was not known how\nthis had been effected, the police agents and the sergeants “could not\nunderstand it at all.” He had converted himself into vapor, he had\nslipped through the handcuffs, he had trickled through the crevices of\nthe carriage, the fiacre was cracked, and he had fled; all that they\nwere able to say was, that on arriving at the prison, there was no\nClaquesous. Either the fairies or the police had had a hand in it. Had\nClaquesous melted into the shadows like a snow-flake in water? Had\nthere been unavowed connivance of the police agents? Did this man\nbelong to the double enigma of order and disorder? Was he concentric\nwith infraction and repression? Had this sphinx his fore paws in crime\nand his hind paws in authority? Javert did not accept such\ncomminations, and would have bristled up against such compromises; but\nhis squad included other inspectors besides himself, who were more\ninitiated than he, perhaps, although they were his subordinates in the\nsecrets of the Prefecture, and Claquesous had been such a villain that\nhe might make a very good agent. It is an excellent thing for\nruffianism and an admirable thing for the police to be on such intimate\njuggling terms with the night. These double-edged rascals do exist.\nHowever that may be, Claquesous had gone astray and was not found\nagain. Javert appeared to be more irritated than amazed at this.\n\nAs for Marius, “that booby of a lawyer,” who had probably become\nfrightened, and whose name Javert had forgotten, Javert attached very\nlittle importance to him. Moreover, a lawyer can be hunted up at any\ntime. But was he a lawyer after all?\n\nThe investigation had begun.\n\nThe magistrate had thought it advisable not to put one of these men of\nthe band of Patron Minette in close confinement, in the hope that he\nwould chatter. This man was Brujon, the long-haired man of the Rue du\nPetit-Banquier. He had been let loose in the Charlemagne courtyard, and\nthe eyes of the watchers were fixed on him.\n\nThis name of Brujon is one of the souvenirs of La Force. In that\nhideous courtyard, called the court of the Bâtiment-Neuf (New\nBuilding), which the administration called the court Saint-Bernard, and\nwhich the robbers called the Fosse-aux-Lions (The Lion’s Ditch), on\nthat wall covered with scales and leprosy, which rose on the left to a\nlevel with the roofs, near an old door of rusty iron which led to the\nancient chapel of the ducal residence of La Force, then turned in a\ndormitory for ruffians, there could still be seen, twelve years ago, a\nsort of fortress roughly carved in the stone with a nail, and beneath\nit this signature:—\n\nBRUJON, 1811.\n\nThe Brujon of 1811 was the father of the Brujon of 1832.\n\nThe latter, of whom the reader caught but a glimpse at the Gorbeau\nhouse, was a very cunning and very adroit young spark, with a\nbewildered and plaintive air. It was in consequence of this plaintive\nair that the magistrate had released him, thinking him more useful in\nthe Charlemagne yard than in close confinement.\n\nRobbers do not interrupt their profession because they are in the hands\nof justice. They do not let themselves be put out by such a trifle as\nthat. To be in prison for one crime is no reason for not beginning on\nanother crime. They are artists, who have one picture in the salon, and\nwho toil, nonetheless, on a new work in their studios.\n\nBrujon seemed to be stupefied by prison. He could sometimes be seen\nstanding by the hour together in front of the sutler’s window in the\nCharlemagne yard, staring like an idiot at the sordid list of prices\nwhich began with: _garlic_, 62 _centimes_, and ended with: _cigar_, 5\n_centimes_. Or he passed his time in trembling, chattering his teeth,\nsaying that he had a fever, and inquiring whether one of the eight and\ntwenty beds in the fever ward was vacant.\n\nAll at once, towards the end of February, 1832, it was discovered that\nBrujon, that somnolent fellow, had had three different commissions\nexecuted by the errand-men of the establishment, not under his own\nname, but in the name of three of his comrades; and they had cost him\nin all fifty sous, an exorbitant outlay which attracted the attention\nof the prison corporal.\n\nInquiries were instituted, and on consulting the tariff of commissions\nposted in the convict’s parlor, it was learned that the fifty sous\ncould be analyzed as follows: three commissions; one to the Panthéon,\nten sous; one to Val-de-Grâce, fifteen sous; and one to the Barrière de\nGrenelle, twenty-five sous. This last was the dearest of the whole\ntariff. Now, at the Panthéon, at the Val-de-Grâce, and at the Barrière\nde Grenelle were situated the domiciles of the three very redoubtable\nprowlers of the barriers, Kruideniers, alias Bizarro, Glorieux, an\nex-convict, and Barre-Carosse, upon whom the attention of the police\nwas directed by this incident. It was thought that these men were\nmembers of Patron Minette; two of those leaders, Babet and Gueulemer,\nhad been captured. It was supposed that the messages, which had been\naddressed, not to houses, but to people who were waiting for them in\nthe street, must have contained information with regard to some crime\nthat had been plotted. They were in possession of other indications;\nthey laid hand on the three prowlers, and supposed that they had\ncircumvented some one or other of Brujon’s machinations.\n\nAbout a week after these measures had been taken, one night, as the\nsuperintendent of the watch, who had been inspecting the lower\ndormitory in the Bâtiment-Neuf, was about to drop his chestnut in the\nbox—this was the means adopted to make sure that the watchmen performed\ntheir duties punctually; every hour a chestnut must be dropped into all\nthe boxes nailed to the doors of the dormitories—a watchman looked\nthrough the peep-hole of the dormitory and beheld Brujon sitting on his\nbed and writing something by the light of the hall-lamp. The guardian\nentered, Brujon was put in a solitary cell for a month, but they were\nnot able to seize what he had written. The police learned nothing\nfurther about it.\n\nWhat is certain is, that on the following morning, a “postilion” was\nflung from the Charlemagne yard into the Lions’ Ditch, over the\nfive-story building which separated the two court-yards.\n\nWhat prisoners call a “postilion” is a pallet of bread artistically\nmoulded, which is sent _into Ireland_, that is to say, over the roofs\nof a prison, from one courtyard to another. Etymology: over England;\nfrom one land to another; _into Ireland_. This little pellet falls in\nthe yard. The man who picks it up opens it and finds in it a note\naddressed to some prisoner in that yard. If it is a prisoner who finds\nthe treasure, he forwards the note to its destination; if it is a\nkeeper, or one of the prisoners secretly sold who are called _sheep_ in\nprisons and _foxes_ in the galleys, the note is taken to the office and\nhanded over to the police.\n\nOn this occasion, the postilion reached its address, although the\nperson to whom it was addressed was, at that moment, in solitary\nconfinement. This person was no other than Babet, one of the four heads\nof Patron Minette.\n\nThe postilion contained a roll of paper on which only these two lines\nwere written:—\n\n“Babet. There is an affair in the Rue Plumet. A gate on a garden.”\n\n\nThis is what Brujon had written the night before.\n\nIn spite of male and female searchers, Babet managed to pass the note\non from La Force to the Salpêtrière, to a “good friend” whom he had and\nwho was shut up there. This woman in turn transmitted the note to\nanother woman of her acquaintance, a certain Magnon, who was strongly\nsuspected by the police, though not yet arrested. This Magnon, whose\nname the reader has already seen, had relations with the Thénardier,\nwhich will be described in detail later on, and she could, by going to\nsee Éponine, serve as a bridge between the Salpêtrière and Les\nMadelonettes.\n\nIt happened, that at precisely that moment, as proofs were wanting in\nthe investigation directed against Thénardier in the matter of his\ndaughters, Éponine and Azelma were released. When Éponine came out,\nMagnon, who was watching the gate of the Madelonettes, handed her\nBrujon’s note to Babet, charging her to look into the matter.\n\nÉponine went to the Rue Plumet, recognized the gate and the garden,\nobserved the house, spied, lurked, and, a few days later, brought to\nMagnon, who delivers in the Rue Clocheperce, a biscuit, which Magnon\ntransmitted to Babet’s mistress in the Salpêtrière. A biscuit, in the\nshady symbolism of prisons, signifies: Nothing to be done.\n\nSo that in less than a week from that time, as Brujon and Babet met in\nthe circle of La Force, the one on his way to the examination, the\nother on his way from it:—\n\n“Well?” asked Brujon, “the Rue P.?”\n\n\n“Biscuit,” replied Babet. Thus did the fœtus of crime engendered by\nBrujon in La Force miscarry.\n\nThis miscarriage had its consequences, however, which were perfectly\ndistinct from Brujon’s programme. The reader will see what they were.\n\nOften when we think we are knotting one thread, we are tying quite\nanother.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—APPARITION TO FATHER MABEUF\n\n\nMarius no longer went to see any one, but he sometimes encountered\nFather Mabeuf by chance.\n\nWhile Marius was slowly descending those melancholy steps which may be\ncalled the cellar stairs, and which lead to places without light, where\nthe happy can be heard walking overhead, M. Mabeuf was descending on\nhis side.\n\nThe _Flora of Cauteretz_ no longer sold at all. The experiments on\nindigo had not been successful in the little garden of Austerlitz,\nwhich had a bad exposure. M. Mabeuf could cultivate there only a few\nplants which love shade and dampness. Nevertheless, he did not become\ndiscouraged. He had obtained a corner in the Jardin des Plantes, with a\ngood exposure, to make his trials with indigo “at his own expense.” For\nthis purpose he had pawned his copperplates of the _Flora_. He had\nreduced his breakfast to two eggs, and he left one of these for his old\nservant, to whom he had paid no wages for the last fifteen months. And\noften his breakfast was his only meal. He no longer smiled with his\ninfantile smile, he had grown morose and no longer received visitors.\nMarius did well not to dream of going thither. Sometimes, at the hour\nwhen M. Mabeuf was on his way to the Jardin des Plantes, the old man\nand the young man passed each other on the Boulevard de l’Hôpital. They\ndid not speak, and only exchanged a melancholy sign of the head. A\nheart-breaking thing it is that there comes a moment when misery looses\nbonds! Two men who have been friends become two chance passers-by.\n\nRoyol the bookseller was dead. M. Mabeuf no longer knew his books, his\ngarden, or his indigo: these were the three forms which happiness,\npleasure, and hope had assumed for him. This sufficed him for his\nliving. He said to himself: “When I shall have made my balls of\nblueing, I shall be rich, I will withdraw my copperplates from the\npawn-shop, I will put my _Flora_ in vogue again with trickery, plenty\nof money and advertisements in the newspapers and I will buy, I know\nwell where, a copy of Pierre de Médine’s _Art de Naviguer_, with\nwood-cuts, edition of 1655.” In the meantime, he toiled all day over\nhis plot of indigo, and at night he returned home to water his garden,\nand to read his books. At that epoch, M. Mabeuf was nearly eighty years\nof age.\n\nOne evening he had a singular apparition.\n\nHe had returned home while it was still broad daylight. Mother\nPlutarque, whose health was declining, was ill and in bed. He had dined\non a bone, on which a little meat lingered, and a bit of bread that he\nhad found on the kitchen table, and had seated himself on an overturned\nstone post, which took the place of a bench in his garden.\n\nNear this bench there rose, after the fashion in orchard-gardens, a\nsort of large chest, of beams and planks, much dilapidated, a\nrabbit-hutch on the ground floor, a fruit-closet on the first. There\nwas nothing in the hutch, but there were a few apples in the\nfruit-closet,—the remains of the winter’s provision.\n\nM. Mabeuf had set himself to turning over and reading, with the aid of\nhis glasses, two books of which he was passionately fond and in which,\na serious thing at his age, he was interested. His natural timidity\nrendered him accessible to the acceptance of superstitions in a certain\ndegree. The first of these books was the famous treatise of President\nDelancre, _De l’Inconstance des Démons_; the other was a quarto by\nMutor de la Rubaudière, _Sur les Diables de Vauvert et les Gobelins de\nla Bièvre_. This last-mentioned old volume interested him all the more,\nbecause his garden had been one of the spots haunted by goblins in\nformer times. The twilight had begun to whiten what was on high and to\nblacken all below. As he read, over the top of the book which he held\nin his hand, Father Mabeuf was surveying his plants, and among others a\nmagnificent rhododendron which was one of his consolations; four days\nof heat, wind, and sun without a drop of rain, had passed; the stalks\nwere bending, the buds drooping, the leaves falling; all this needed\nwater, the rhododendron was particularly sad. Father Mabeuf was one of\nthose persons for whom plants have souls. The old man had toiled all\nday over his indigo plot, he was worn out with fatigue, but he rose,\nlaid his books on the bench, and walked, all bent over and with\ntottering footsteps, to the well, but when he had grasped the chain, he\ncould not even draw it sufficiently to unhook it. Then he turned round\nand cast a glance of anguish toward heaven which was becoming studded\nwith stars.\n\nThe evening had that serenity which overwhelms the troubles of man\nbeneath an indescribably mournful and eternal joy. The night promised\nto be as arid as the day had been.\n\n“Stars everywhere!” thought the old man; “not the tiniest cloud! Not a\ndrop of water!”\n\n\nAnd his head, which had been upraised for a moment, fell back upon his\nbreast.\n\nHe raised it again, and once more looked at the sky, murmuring:—\n\n“A tear of dew! A little pity!”\n\n\nHe tried again to unhook the chain of the well, and could not.\n\nAt that moment, he heard a voice saying:—\n\n“Father Mabeuf, would you like to have me water your garden for you?”\n\n\nAt the same time, a noise as of a wild animal passing became audible in\nthe hedge, and he beheld emerging from the shrubbery a sort of tall,\nslender girl, who drew herself up in front of him and stared boldly at\nhim. She had less the air of a human being than of a form which had\njust blossomed forth from the twilight.\n\nBefore Father Mabeuf, who was easily terrified, and who was, as we have\nsaid, quick to take alarm, was able to reply by a single syllable, this\nbeing, whose movements had a sort of odd abruptness in the darkness,\nhad unhooked the chain, plunged in and withdrawn the bucket, and filled\nthe watering-pot, and the goodman beheld this apparition, which had\nbare feet and a tattered petticoat, running about among the flower-beds\ndistributing life around her. The sound of the watering-pot on the\nleaves filled Father Mabeuf’s soul with ecstasy. It seemed to him that\nthe rhododendron was happy now.\n\nThe first bucketful emptied, the girl drew a second, then a third. She\nwatered the whole garden.\n\nThere was something about her, as she thus ran about among paths, where\nher outline appeared perfectly black, waving her angular arms, and with\nher fichu all in rags, that resembled a bat.\n\nWhen she had finished, Father Mabeuf approached her with tears in his\neyes, and laid his hand on her brow.\n\n“God will bless you,” said he, “you are an angel since you take care of\nthe flowers.”\n\n\n“No,” she replied. “I am the devil, but that’s all the same to me.”\n\n\nThe old man exclaimed, without either waiting for or hearing her\nresponse:—\n\n“What a pity that I am so unhappy and so poor, and that I can do\nnothing for you!”\n\n\n“You can do something,” said she.\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“Tell me where M. Marius lives.”\n\n\nThe old man did not understand. “What Monsieur Marius?”\n\n\nHe raised his glassy eyes and seemed to be seeking something that had\nvanished.\n\n“A young man who used to come here.”\n\n\nIn the meantime, M. Mabeuf had searched his memory.\n\n“Ah! yes—” he exclaimed. “I know what you mean. Wait! Monsieur\nMarius—the Baron Marius Pontmercy, parbleu! He lives,—or rather, he no\nlonger lives,—ah well, I don’t know.”\n\n\nAs he spoke, he had bent over to train a branch of rhododendron, and he\ncontinued:—\n\n“Hold, I know now. He very often passes along the boulevard, and goes\nin the direction of the Glacière, Rue Croulebarbe. The meadow of the\nLark. Go there. It is not hard to meet him.”\n\n\nWhen M. Mabeuf straightened himself up, there was no longer any one\nthere; the girl had disappeared.\n\nHe was decidedly terrified.\n\n“Really,” he thought, “if my garden had not been watered, I should\nthink that she was a spirit.”\n\n\nAn hour later, when he was in bed, it came back to him, and as he fell\nasleep, at that confused moment when thought, like that fabulous bird\nwhich changes itself into a fish in order to cross the sea, little by\nlittle assumes the form of a dream in order to traverse slumber, he\nsaid to himself in a bewildered way:—\n\n“In sooth, that greatly resembles what Rubaudière narrates of the\ngoblins. Could it have been a goblin?”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—AN APPARITION TO MARIUS\n\n\nSome days after this visit of a “spirit” to Farmer Mabeuf, one\nmorning,—it was on a Monday, the day when Marius borrowed the\nhundred-sou piece from Courfeyrac for Thénardier—Marius had put this\ncoin in his pocket, and before carrying it to the clerk’s office, he\nhad gone “to take a little stroll,” in the hope that this would make\nhim work on his return. It was always thus, however. As soon as he\nrose, he seated himself before a book and a sheet of paper in order to\nscribble some translation; his task at that epoch consisted in turning\ninto French a celebrated quarrel between Germans, the Gans and Savigny\ncontroversy; he took Savigny, he took Gans, read four lines, tried to\nwrite one, could not, saw a star between him and his paper, and rose\nfrom his chair, saying: “I shall go out. That will put me in spirits.”\n\n\nAnd off he went to the Lark’s meadow.\n\nThere he beheld more than ever the star, and less than ever Savigny and\nGans.\n\nHe returned home, tried to take up his work again, and did not succeed;\nthere was no means of re-knotting a single one of the threads which\nwere broken in his brain; then he said to himself: “I will not go out\nto-morrow. It prevents my working.” And he went out every day.\n\nHe lived in the Lark’s meadow more than in Courfeyrac’s lodgings. That\nwas his real address: Boulevard de la Santé, at the seventh tree from\nthe Rue Croulebarbe.\n\nThat morning he had quitted the seventh tree and had seated himself on\nthe parapet of the River des Gobelins. A cheerful sunlight penetrated\nthe freshly unfolded and luminous leaves.\n\nHe was dreaming of “Her.” And his meditation turning to a reproach,\nfell back upon himself; he reflected dolefully on his idleness, his\nparalysis of soul, which was gaining on him, and of that night which\nwas growing more dense every moment before him, to such a point that he\nno longer even saw the sun.\n\nNevertheless, athwart this painful extrication of indistinct ideas\nwhich was not even a monologue, so feeble had action become in him, and\nhe had no longer the force to care to despair, athwart this melancholy\nabsorption, sensations from without did reach him. He heard behind him,\nbeneath him, on both banks of the river, the laundresses of the\nGobelins beating their linen, and above his head, the birds chattering\nand singing in the elm-trees. On the one hand, the sound of liberty,\nthe careless happiness of the leisure which has wings; on the other,\nthe sound of toil. What caused him to meditate deeply, and almost\nreflect, were two cheerful sounds.\n\nAll at once, in the midst of his dejected ecstasy, he heard a familiar\nvoice saying:—\n\n“Come! Here he is!”\n\n\nHe raised his eyes, and recognized that wretched child who had come to\nhim one morning, the elder of the Thénardier daughters, Éponine; he\nknew her name now. Strange to say, she had grown poorer and prettier,\ntwo steps which it had not seemed within her power to take. She had\naccomplished a double progress, towards the light and towards distress.\nShe was barefooted and in rags, as on the day when she had so\nresolutely entered his chamber, only her rags were two months older\nnow, the holes were larger, the tatters more sordid. It was the same\nharsh voice, the same brow dimmed and wrinkled with tan, the same free,\nwild, and vacillating glance. She had besides, more than formerly, in\nher face that indescribably terrified and lamentable something which\nsojourn in a prison adds to wretchedness.\n\nShe had bits of straw and hay in her hair, not like Ophelia through\nhaving gone mad from the contagion of Hamlet’s madness, but because she\nhad slept in the loft of some stable.\n\nAnd in spite of it all, she was beautiful. What a star art thou, O\nyouth!\n\nIn the meantime, she had halted in front of Marius with a trace of joy\nin her livid countenance, and something which resembled a smile.\n\nShe stood for several moments as though incapable of speech.\n\n“So I have met you at last!” she said at length. “Father Mabeuf was\nright, it was on this boulevard! How I have hunted for you! If you only\nknew! Do you know? I have been in the jug. A fortnight! They let me\nout! seeing that there was nothing against me, and that, moreover, I\nhad not reached years of discretion. I lack two months of it. Oh! how I\nhave hunted for you! These six weeks! So you don’t live down there any\nmore?”\n\n\n“No,” said Marius.\n\n“Ah! I understand. Because of that affair. Those take-downs are\ndisagreeable. You cleared out. Come now! Why do you wear old hats like\nthis! A young man like you ought to have fine clothes. Do you know,\nMonsieur Marius, Father Mabeuf calls you Baron Marius, I don’t know\nwhat. It isn’t true that you are a baron? Barons are old fellows, they\ngo to the Luxembourg, in front of the château, where there is the most\nsun, and they read the _Quotidienne_ for a sou. I once carried a letter\nto a baron of that sort. He was over a hundred years old. Say, where do\nyou live now?”\n\n\nMarius made no reply.\n\n“Ah!” she went on, “you have a hole in your shirt. I must sew it up for\nyou.”\n\n\nShe resumed with an expression which gradually clouded over:—\n\n“You don’t seem glad to see me.”\n\n\nMarius held his peace; she remained silent for a moment, then\nexclaimed:—\n\n“But if I choose, nevertheless, I could force you to look glad!”\n\n\n“What?” demanded Marius. “What do you mean?”\n\n\n“Ah! you used to call me _thou_,” she retorted.\n\n“Well, then, what dost thou mean?”\n\n\nShe bit her lips; she seemed to hesitate, as though a prey to some sort\nof inward conflict. At last she appeared to come to a decision.\n\n“So much the worse, I don’t care. You have a melancholy air, I want you\nto be pleased. Only promise me that you will smile. I want to see you\nsmile and hear you say: ‘Ah, well, that’s good.’ Poor Mr. Marius! you\nknow? You promised me that you would give me anything I like—”\n\n\n“Yes! Only speak!”\n\n\nShe looked Marius full in the eye, and said:—\n\n“I have the address.”\n\n\nMarius turned pale. All the blood flowed back to his heart.\n\n“What address?”\n\n\n“The address that you asked me to get!”\n\n\nShe added, as though with an effort:—\n\n“The address—you know very well!”\n\n\n“Yes!” stammered Marius.\n\n“Of that young lady.”\n\n\nThis word uttered, she sighed deeply.\n\nMarius sprang from the parapet on which he had been sitting and seized\nher hand distractedly.\n\n“Oh! Well! lead me thither! Tell me! Ask of me anything you wish! Where\nis it?”\n\n\n“Come with me,” she responded. “I don’t know the street or number very\nwell; it is in quite the other direction from here, but I know the\nhouse well, I will take you to it.”\n\n\nShe withdrew her hand and went on, in a tone which could have rent the\nheart of an observer, but which did not even graze Marius in his\nintoxicated and ecstatic state:—\n\n“Oh! how glad you are!”\n\n\nA cloud swept across Marius’ brow. He seized Éponine by the arm:—\n\n“Swear one thing to me!”\n\n\n“Swear!” said she, “what does that mean? Come! You want me to swear?”\n\n\nAnd she laughed.\n\n“Your father! promise me, Éponine! Swear to me that you will not give\nthis address to your father!”\n\n\nShe turned to him with a stupefied air.\n\n“Éponine! How do you know that my name is Éponine?”\n\n\n“Promise what I tell you!”\n\n\nBut she did not seem to hear him.\n\n“That’s nice! You have called me Éponine!”\n\n\nMarius grasped both her arms at once.\n\n“But answer me, in the name of Heaven! pay attention to what I am\nsaying to you, swear to me that you will not tell your father this\naddress that you know!”\n\n\n“My father!” said she. “Ah yes, my father! Be at ease. He’s in close\nconfinement. Besides, what do I care for my father!”\n\n\n“But you do not promise me!” exclaimed Marius.\n\n“Let go of me!” she said, bursting into a laugh, “how you do shake me!\nYes! Yes! I promise that! I swear that to you! What is that to me? I\nwill not tell my father the address. There! Is that right? Is that it?”\n\n\n“Nor to any one?” said Marius.\n\n“Nor to any one.”\n\n\n“Now,” resumed Marius, “take me there.”\n\n\n“Immediately?”\n\n\n“Immediately.”\n\n\n“Come along. Ah! how pleased he is!” said she.\n\nAfter a few steps she halted.\n\n“You are following me too closely, Monsieur Marius. Let me go on ahead,\nand follow me so, without seeming to do it. A nice young man like you\nmust not be seen with a woman like me.”\n\n\nNo tongue can express all that lay in that word, _woman_, thus\npronounced by that child.\n\nShe proceeded a dozen paces and then halted once more; Marius joined\nher. She addressed him sideways, and without turning towards him:—\n\n“By the way, you know that you promised me something?”\n\n\nMarius fumbled in his pocket. All that he owned in the world was the\nfive francs intended for Thénardier the father. He took them and laid\nthem in Éponine’s hand.\n\nShe opened her fingers and let the coin fall to the ground, and gazed\nat him with a gloomy air.\n\n“I don’t want your money,” said she.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THIRD—THE HOUSE IN THE RUE PLUMET\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE HOUSE WITH A SECRET\n\n\nAbout the middle of the last century, a chief justice in the Parliament\nof Paris having a mistress and concealing the fact, for at that period\nthe grand seignors displayed their mistresses, and the bourgeois\nconcealed them, had “a little house” built in the Faubourg\nSaint-Germain, in the deserted Rue Blomet, which is now called Rue\nPlumet, not far from the spot which was then designated as _Combat des\nAnimaux_.\n\nThis house was composed of a single-storied pavilion; two rooms on the\nground floor, two chambers on the first floor, a kitchen downstairs, a\nboudoir upstairs, an attic under the roof, the whole preceded by a\ngarden with a large gate opening on the street. This garden was about\nan acre and a half in extent. This was all that could be seen by\npassers-by; but behind the pavilion there was a narrow courtyard, and\nat the end of the courtyard a low building consisting of two rooms and\na cellar, a sort of preparation destined to conceal a child and nurse\nin case of need. This building communicated in the rear by a masked\ndoor which opened by a secret spring, with a long, narrow, paved\nwinding corridor, open to the sky, hemmed in with two lofty walls,\nwhich, hidden with wonderful art, and lost as it were between garden\nenclosures and cultivated land, all of whose angles and detours it\nfollowed, ended in another door, also with a secret lock which opened a\nquarter of a league away, almost in another quarter, at the solitary\nextremity of the Rue du Babylone.\n\nThrough this the chief justice entered, so that even those who were\nspying on him and following him would merely have observed that the\njustice betook himself every day in a mysterious way somewhere, and\nwould never have suspected that to go to the Rue de Babylone was to go\nto the Rue Blomet. Thanks to clever purchasers of land, the magistrate\nhad been able to make a secret, sewer-like passage on his own property,\nand consequently, without interference. Later on, he had sold in little\nparcels, for gardens and market gardens, the lots of ground adjoining\nthe corridor, and the proprietors of these lots on both sides thought\nthey had a party wall before their eyes, and did not even suspect the\nlong, paved ribbon winding between two walls amid their flower-beds and\ntheir orchards. Only the birds beheld this curiosity. It is probable\nthat the linnets and tomtits of the last century gossiped a great deal\nabout the chief justice.\n\nThe pavilion, built of stone in the taste of Mansard, wainscoted and\nfurnished in the Watteau style, rocaille on the inside, old-fashioned\non the outside, walled in with a triple hedge of flowers, had something\ndiscreet, coquettish, and solemn about it, as befits a caprice of love\nand magistracy.\n\nThis house and corridor, which have now disappeared, were in existence\nfifteen years ago. In ’93 a coppersmith had purchased the house with\nthe idea of demolishing it, but had not been able to pay the price; the\nnation made him bankrupt. So that it was the house which demolished the\ncoppersmith. After that, the house remained uninhabited, and fell\nslowly to ruin, as does every dwelling to which the presence of man\ndoes not communicate life. It had remained fitted with its old\nfurniture, was always for sale or to let, and the ten or a dozen people\nwho passed through the Rue Plumet were warned of the fact by a yellow\nand illegible bit of writing which had hung on the garden wall since\n1819.\n\nTowards the end of the Restoration, these same passers-by might have\nnoticed that the bill had disappeared, and even that the shutters on\nthe first floor were open. The house was occupied, in fact. The windows\nhad short curtains, a sign that there was a woman about.\n\nIn the month of October, 1829, a man of a certain age had presented\nhimself and had hired the house just as it stood, including, of course,\nthe back building and the lane which ended in the Rue de Babylone. He\nhad had the secret openings of the two doors to this passage repaired.\nThe house, as we have just mentioned, was still very nearly furnished\nwith the justice’s old fitting; the new tenant had ordered some\nrepairs, had added what was lacking here and there, had replaced the\npaving-stones in the yard, bricks in the floors, steps in the stairs,\nmissing bits in the inlaid floors and the glass in the lattice windows,\nand had finally installed himself there with a young girl and an\nelderly maid-servant, without commotion, rather like a person who is\nslipping in than like a man who is entering his own house. The\nneighbors did not gossip about him, for the reason that there were no\nneighbors.\n\nThis unobtrusive tenant was Jean Valjean, the young girl was Cosette.\nThe servant was a woman named Toussaint, whom Jean Valjean had saved\nfrom the hospital and from wretchedness, and who was elderly, a\nstammerer, and from the provinces, three qualities which had decided\nJean Valjean to take her with him. He had hired the house under the\nname of M. Fauchelevent, independent gentleman. In all that has been\nrelated heretofore, the reader has, doubtless, been no less prompt than\nThénardier to recognize Jean Valjean.\n\nWhy had Jean Valjean quitted the convent of the Petit-Picpus? What had\nhappened?\n\nNothing had happened.\n\nIt will be remembered that Jean Valjean was happy in the convent, so\nhappy that his conscience finally took the alarm. He saw Cosette every\nday, he felt paternity spring up and develop within him more and more,\nhe brooded over the soul of that child, he said to himself that she was\nhis, that nothing could take her from him, that this would last\nindefinitely, that she would certainly become a nun, being thereto\ngently incited every day, that thus the convent was henceforth the\nuniverse for her as it was for him, that he should grow old there, and\nthat she would grow up there, that she would grow old there, and that\nhe should die there; that, in short, delightful hope, no separation was\npossible. On reflecting upon this, he fell into perplexity. He\ninterrogated himself. He asked himself if all that happiness were\nreally his, if it were not composed of the happiness of another, of the\nhappiness of that child which he, an old man, was confiscating and\nstealing; if that were not theft? He said to himself, that this child\nhad a right to know life before renouncing it, that to deprive her in\nadvance, and in some sort without consulting her, of all joys, under\nthe pretext of saving her from all trials, to take advantage of her\nignorance of her isolation, in order to make an artificial vocation\ngerminate in her, was to rob a human creature of its nature and to lie\nto God. And who knows if, when she came to be aware of all this some\nday, and found herself a nun to her sorrow, Cosette would not come to\nhate him? A last, almost selfish thought, and less heroic than the\nrest, but which was intolerable to him. He resolved to quit the\nconvent.\n\nHe resolved on this; he recognized with anguish, the fact that it was\nnecessary. As for objections, there were none. Five years’ sojourn\nbetween these four walls and of disappearance had necessarily destroyed\nor dispersed the elements of fear. He could return tranquilly among\nmen. He had grown old, and all had undergone a change. Who would\nrecognize him now? And then, to face the worst, there was danger only\nfor himself, and he had no right to condemn Cosette to the cloister for\nthe reason that he had been condemned to the galleys. Besides, what is\ndanger in comparison with the right? Finally, nothing prevented his\nbeing prudent and taking his precautions.\n\nAs for Cosette’s education, it was almost finished and complete.\n\nHis determination once taken, he awaited an opportunity. It was not\nlong in presenting itself. Old Fauchelevent died.\n\nJean Valjean demanded an audience with the revered prioress and told\nher that, having come into a little inheritance at the death of his\nbrother, which permitted him henceforth to live without working, he\nshould leave the service of the convent and take his daughter with him;\nbut that, as it was not just that Cosette, since she had not taken the\nvows, should have received her education gratuitously, he humbly begged\nthe Reverend Prioress to see fit that he should offer to the community,\nas indemnity, for the five years which Cosette had spent there, the sum\nof five thousand francs.\n\nIt was thus that Jean Valjean quitted the convent of the Perpetual\nAdoration.\n\nOn leaving the convent, he took in his own arms the little valise the\nkey to which he still wore on his person, and would permit no porter to\ntouch it. This puzzled Cosette, because of the odor of embalming which\nproceeded from it.\n\nLet us state at once, that this trunk never quitted him more. He always\nhad it in his chamber. It was the first and only thing sometimes, that\nhe carried off in his moving when he moved about. Cosette laughed at\nit, and called this valise his _inseparable_, saying: “I am jealous of\nit.”\n\n\nNevertheless, Jean Valjean did not reappear in the open air without\nprofound anxiety.\n\nHe discovered the house in the Rue Plumet, and hid himself from sight\nthere. Henceforth he was in the possession of the name:—Ultime\nFauchelevent.\n\nAt the same time he hired two other apartments in Paris, in order that\nhe might attract less attention than if he were to remain always in the\nsame quarter, and so that he could, at need, take himself off at the\nslightest disquietude which should assail him, and in short, so that he\nmight not again be caught unprovided as on the night when he had so\nmiraculously escaped from Javert. These two apartments were very\npitiable, poor in appearance, and in two quarters which were far remote\nfrom each other, the one in the Rue de l’Ouest, the other in the Rue de\nl’Homme Armé.\n\nHe went from time to time, now to the Rue de l’Homme Armé, now to the\nRue de l’Ouest, to pass a month or six weeks, without taking Toussaint.\nHe had himself served by the porters, and gave himself out as a\ngentleman from the suburbs, living on his funds, and having a little\ntemporary resting-place in town. This lofty virtue had three domiciles\nin Paris for the sake of escaping from the police.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—JEAN VALJEAN AS A NATIONAL GUARD\n\n\nHowever, properly speaking, he lived in the Rue Plumet, and he had\narranged his existence there in the following fashion:—\n\nCosette and the servant occupied the pavilion; she had the big\nsleeping-room with the painted pier-glasses, the boudoir with the\ngilded fillets, the justice’s drawing-room furnished with tapestries\nand vast armchairs; she had the garden. Jean Valjean had a canopied bed\nof antique damask in three colors and a beautiful Persian rug purchased\nin the Rue du Figuier-Saint-Paul at Mother Gaucher’s, put into\nCosette’s chamber, and, in order to redeem the severity of these\nmagnificent old things, he had amalgamated with this bric-à-brac all\nthe gay and graceful little pieces of furniture suitable to young\ngirls, an étagère, a bookcase filled with gilt-edged books, an\ninkstand, a blotting-book, paper, a work-table incrusted with mother of\npearl, a silver-gilt dressing-case, a toilet service in Japanese\nporcelain. Long damask curtains with a red foundation and three colors,\nlike those on the bed, hung at the windows of the first floor. On the\nground floor, the curtains were of tapestry. All winter long, Cosette’s\nlittle house was heated from top to bottom. Jean Valjean inhabited the\nsort of porter’s lodge which was situated at the end of the back\ncourtyard, with a mattress on a folding-bed, a white wood table, two\nstraw chairs, an earthenware water-jug, a few old volumes on a shelf,\nhis beloved valise in one corner, and never any fire. He dined with\nCosette, and he had a loaf of black bread on the table for his own use.\n\nWhen Toussaint came, he had said to her: “It is the young lady who is\nthe mistress of this house.”—“And you, monsieur?” Toussaint replied in\namazement.—“I am a much better thing than the master, I am the father.”\n\n\nCosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent, and she regulated\ntheir expenditure, which was very modest. Every day, Jean Valjean put\nhis arm through Cosette’s and took her for a walk. He led her to the\nLuxembourg, to the least frequented walk, and every Sunday he took her\nto mass at Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, because that was a long way off.\nAs it was a very poor quarter, he bestowed alms largely there, and the\npoor people surrounded him in church, which had drawn down upon him\nThénardier’s epistle: “To the benevolent gentleman of the church of\nSaint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas.” He was fond of taking Cosette to visit the\npoor and the sick. No stranger ever entered the house in the Rue\nPlumet. Toussaint brought their provisions, and Jean Valjean went\nhimself for water to a fountain nearby on the boulevard. Their wood and\nwine were put into a half-subterranean hollow lined with rock-work\nwhich lay near the Rue de Babylone and which had formerly served the\nchief-justice as a grotto; for at the epoch of follies and “Little\nHouses” no love was without a grotto.\n\nIn the door opening on the Rue de Babylone, there was a box destined\nfor the reception of letters and papers; only, as the three inhabitants\nof the pavilion in the Rue Plumet received neither papers nor letters,\nthe entire usefulness of that box, formerly the go-between of a love\naffair, and the confidant of a love-lorn lawyer, was now limited to the\ntax-collector’s notices, and the summons of the guard. For M.\nFauchelevent, independent gentleman, belonged to the national guard; he\nhad not been able to escape through the fine meshes of the census of\n1831. The municipal information collected at that time had even reached\nthe convent of the Petit-Picpus, a sort of impenetrable and holy cloud,\nwhence Jean Valjean had emerged in venerable guise, and, consequently,\nworthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the town-hall.\n\nThree or four times a year, Jean Valjean donned his uniform and mounted\nguard; he did this willingly, however; it was a correct disguise which\nmixed him with every one, and yet left him solitary. Jean Valjean had\njust attained his sixtieth birthday, the age of legal exemption; but he\ndid not appear to be over fifty; moreover, he had no desire to escape\nhis sergeant-major nor to quibble with Comte de Lobau; he possessed no\ncivil status, he was concealing his name, he was concealing his\nidentity, so he concealed his age, he concealed everything; and, as we\nhave just said, he willingly did his duty as a national guard; the sum\nof his ambition lay in resembling any other man who paid his taxes.\nThis man had for his ideal, within, the angel, without, the bourgeois.\n\nLet us note one detail, however; when Jean Valjean went out with\nCosette, he dressed as the reader has already seen, and had the air of\na retired officer. When he went out alone, which was generally at\nnight, he was always dressed in a workingman’s trousers and blouse, and\nwore a cap which concealed his face. Was this precaution or humility?\nBoth. Cosette was accustomed to the enigmatical side of her destiny,\nand hardly noticed her father’s peculiarities. As for Toussaint, she\nvenerated Jean Valjean, and thought everything he did right.\n\nOne day, her butcher, who had caught a glimpse of Jean Valjean, said to\nher: “That’s a queer fish.” She replied: “He’s a saint.”\n\n\nNeither Jean Valjean nor Cosette nor Toussaint ever entered or emerged\nexcept by the door on the Rue de Babylone. Unless seen through the\ngarden gate it would have been difficult to guess that they lived in\nthe Rue Plumet. That gate was always closed. Jean Valjean had left the\ngarden uncultivated, in order not to attract attention.\n\nIn this, possibly, he made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—FOLIIS AC FRONDIBUS\n\n\nThe garden thus left to itself for more than half a century had become\nextraordinary and charming. The passers-by of forty years ago halted to\ngaze at it, without a suspicion of the secrets which it hid in its\nfresh and verdant depths. More than one dreamer of that epoch often\nallowed his thoughts and his eyes to penetrate indiscreetly between the\nbars of that ancient, padlocked gate, twisted, tottering, fastened to\ntwo green and moss-covered pillars, and oddly crowned with a pediment\nof undecipherable arabesque.\n\nThere was a stone bench in one corner, one or two mouldy statues,\nseveral lattices which had lost their nails with time, were rotting on\nthe wall, and there were no walks nor turf; but there was enough grass\neverywhere. Gardening had taken its departure, and nature had returned.\nWeeds abounded, which was a great piece of luck for a poor corner of\nland. The festival of gilliflowers was something splendid. Nothing in\nthis garden obstructed the sacred effort of things towards life;\nvenerable growth reigned there among them. The trees had bent over\ntowards the nettles, the plant had sprung upward, the branch had\ninclined, that which crawls on the earth had gone in search of that\nwhich expands in the air, that which floats on the wind had bent over\ntowards that which trails in the moss; trunks, boughs, leaves, fibres,\nclusters, tendrils, shoots, spines, thorns, had mingled, crossed,\nmarried, confounded themselves in each other; vegetation in a deep and\nclose embrace, had celebrated and accomplished there, under the\nwell-pleased eye of the Creator, in that enclosure three hundred feet\nsquare, the holy mystery of fraternity, symbol of the human fraternity.\nThis garden was no longer a garden, it was a colossal thicket, that is\nto say, something as impenetrable as a forest, as peopled as a city,\nquivering like a nest, sombre like a cathedral, fragrant like a\nbouquet, solitary as a tomb, living as a throng.\n\nIn Floréal34 this enormous thicket, free behind its gate and within its\nfour walls, entered upon the secret labor of germination, quivered in\nthe rising sun, almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths of\ncosmic love, and which feels the sap of April rising and boiling in its\nveins, and shakes to the wind its enormous wonderful green locks,\nsprinkled on the damp earth, on the defaced statues, on the crumbling\nsteps of the pavilion, and even on the pavement of the deserted street,\nflowers like stars, dew like pearls, fecundity, beauty, life, joy,\nperfumes. At midday, a thousand white butterflies took refuge there,\nand it was a divine spectacle to see that living summer snow whirling\nabout there in flakes amid the shade. There, in those gay shadows of\nverdure, a throng of innocent voices spoke sweetly to the soul, and\nwhat the twittering forgot to say the humming completed. In the\nevening, a dreamy vapor exhaled from the garden and enveloped it; a\nshroud of mist, a calm and celestial sadness covered it; the\nintoxicating perfume of the honeysuckles and convolvulus poured out\nfrom every part of it, like an exquisite and subtle poison; the last\nappeals of the woodpeckers and the wagtails were audible as they dozed\namong the branches; one felt the sacred intimacy of the birds and the\ntrees; by day the wings rejoice the leaves, by night the leaves protect\nthe wings.\n\nIn winter the thicket was black, dripping, bristling, shivering, and\nallowed some glimpse of the house. Instead of flowers on the branches\nand dew in the flowers, the long silvery tracks of the snails were\nvisible on the cold, thick carpet of yellow leaves; but in any fashion,\nunder any aspect, at all seasons, spring, winter, summer, autumn, this\ntiny enclosure breathed forth melancholy, contemplation, solitude,\nliberty, the absence of man, the presence of God; and the rusty old\ngate had the air of saying: “This garden belongs to me.”\n\n\nIt was of no avail that the pavements of Paris were there on every\nside, the classic and splendid hotels of the Rue de Varennes a couple\nof paces away, the dome of the Invalides close at hand, the Chamber of\nDeputies not far off; the carriages of the Rue de Bourgogne and of the\nRue Saint-Dominique rumbled luxuriously, in vain, in the vicinity, in\nvain did the yellow, brown, white, and red omnibuses cross each other’s\ncourse at the neighboring crossroads; the Rue Plumet was the desert;\nand the death of the former proprietors, the revolution which had\npassed over it, the crumbling away of ancient fortunes, absence,\nforgetfulness, forty years of abandonment and widowhood, had sufficed\nto restore to this privileged spot ferns, mulleins, hemlock, yarrow,\ntall weeds, great crimped plants, with large leaves of pale green\ncloth, lizards, beetles, uneasy and rapid insects; to cause to spring\nforth from the depths of the earth and to reappear between those four\nwalls a certain indescribable and savage grandeur; and for nature,\nwhich disconcerts the petty arrangements of man, and which sheds\nherself always thoroughly where she diffuses herself at all, in the ant\nas well as in the eagle, to blossom out in a petty little Parisian\ngarden with as much rude force and majesty as in a virgin forest of the\nNew World.\n\nNothing is small, in fact; any one who is subject to the profound and\npenetrating influence of nature knows this. Although no absolute\nsatisfaction is given to philosophy, either to circumscribe the cause\nor to limit the effect, the contemplator falls into those unfathomable\necstasies caused by these decompositions of force terminating in unity.\nEverything toils at everything.\n\nAlgebra is applied to the clouds; the radiation of the star profits the\nrose; no thinker would venture to affirm that the perfume of the\nhawthorn is useless to the constellations. Who, then, can calculate the\ncourse of a molecule? How do we know that the creation of worlds is not\ndetermined by the fall of grains of sand? Who knows the reciprocal ebb\nand flow of the infinitely great and the infinitely little, the\nreverberations of causes in the precipices of being, and the avalanches\nof creation? The tiniest worm is of importance; the great is little,\nthe little is great; everything is balanced in necessity; alarming\nvision for the mind. There are marvellous relations between beings and\nthings; in that inexhaustible whole, from the sun to the grub, nothing\ndespises the other; all have need of each other. The light does not\nbear away terrestrial perfumes into the azure depths, without knowing\nwhat it is doing; the night distributes stellar essences to the\nsleeping flowers. All birds that fly have round their leg the thread of\nthe infinite. Germination is complicated with the bursting forth of a\nmeteor and with the peck of a swallow cracking its egg, and it places\non one level the birth of an earthworm and the advent of Socrates.\nWhere the telescope ends, the microscope begins. Which of the two\npossesses the larger field of vision? Choose. A bit of mould is a\npleiad of flowers; a nebula is an ant-hill of stars. The same\npromiscuousness, and yet more unprecedented, exists between the things\nof the intelligence and the facts of substance. Elements and principles\nmingle, combine, wed, multiply with each other, to such a point that\nthe material and the moral world are brought eventually to the same\nclearness. The phenomenon is perpetually returning upon itself. In the\nvast cosmic exchanges the universal life goes and comes in unknown\nquantities, rolling entirely in the invisible mystery of effluvia,\nemploying everything, not losing a single dream, not a single slumber,\nsowing an animalcule here, crumbling to bits a planet there,\noscillating and winding, making of light a force and of thought an\nelement, disseminated and invisible, dissolving all, except that\ngeometrical point, the _I_; bringing everything back to the soul-atom;\nexpanding everything in God, entangling all activity, from summit to\nbase, in the obscurity of a dizzy mechanism, attaching the flight of an\ninsect to the movement of the earth, subordinating, who knows? Were it\nonly by the identity of the law, the evolution of the comet in the\nfirmament to the whirling of the infusoria in the drop of water. A\nmachine made of mind. Enormous gearing, the prime motor of which is the\ngnat, and whose final wheel is the zodiac.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—CHANGE OF GATE\n\n\nIt seemed that this garden, created in olden days to conceal wanton\nmysteries, had been transformed and become fitted to shelter chaste\nmysteries. There were no longer either arbors, or bowling greens, or\ntunnels, or grottos; there was a magnificent, dishevelled obscurity\nfalling like a veil over all. Paphos had been made over into Eden. It\nis impossible to say what element of repentance had rendered this\nretreat wholesome. This flower-girl now offered her blossom to the\nsoul. This coquettish garden, formerly decidedly compromised, had\nreturned to virginity and modesty. A justice assisted by a gardener, a\ngoodman who thought that he was a continuation of Lamoignon, and\nanother goodman who thought that he was a continuation of Lenôtre, had\nturned it about, cut, ruffled, decked, moulded it to gallantry; nature\nhad taken possession of it once more, had filled it with shade, and had\narranged it for love.\n\nThere was, also, in this solitude, a heart which was quite ready. Love\nhad only to show himself; he had here a temple composed of verdure,\ngrass, moss, the sight of birds, tender shadows, agitated branches, and\na soul made of sweetness, of faith, of candor, of hope, of aspiration,\nand of illusion.\n\nCosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child; she was\na little more than fourteen, and she was at the “ungrateful age”; we\nhave already said, that with the exception of her eyes, she was homely\nrather than pretty; she had no ungraceful feature, but she was awkward,\nthin, timid and bold at once, a grown-up little girl, in short.\n\nHer education was finished, that is to say, she has been taught\nreligion, and even and above all, devotion; then “history,” that is to\nsay the thing that bears that name in convents, geography, grammar, the\nparticiples, the kings of France, a little music, a little drawing,\netc.; but in all other respects she was utterly ignorant, which is a\ngreat charm and a great peril. The soul of a young girl should not be\nleft in the dark; later on, mirages that are too abrupt and too lively\nare formed there, as in a dark chamber. She should be gently and\ndiscreetly enlightened, rather with the reflection of realities than\nwith their harsh and direct light. A useful and graciously austere\nhalf-light which dissipates puerile fears and obviates falls. There is\nnothing but the maternal instinct, that admirable intuition composed of\nthe memories of the virgin and the experience of the woman, which knows\nhow this half-light is to be created and of what it should consist.\n\nNothing supplies the place of this instinct. All the nuns in the world\nare not worth as much as one mother in the formation of a young girl’s\nsoul.\n\nCosette had had no mother. She had only had many mothers, in the\nplural.\n\nAs for Jean Valjean, he was, indeed, all tenderness, all solicitude;\nbut he was only an old man and he knew nothing at all.\n\nNow, in this work of education, in this grave matter of preparing a\nwoman for life, what science is required to combat that vast ignorance\nwhich is called innocence!\n\nNothing prepares a young girl for passions like the convent. The\nconvent turns the thoughts in the direction of the unknown. The heart,\nthus thrown back upon itself, works downward within itself, since it\ncannot overflow, and grows deep, since it cannot expand. Hence visions,\nsuppositions, conjectures, outlines of romances, a desire for\nadventures, fantastic constructions, edifices built wholly in the inner\nobscurity of the mind, sombre and secret abodes where the passions\nimmediately find a lodgement as soon as the open gate permits them to\nenter. The convent is a compression which, in order to triumph over the\nhuman heart, should last during the whole life.\n\nOn quitting the convent, Cosette could have found nothing more sweet\nand more dangerous than the house in the Rue Plumet. It was the\ncontinuation of solitude with the beginning of liberty; a garden that\nwas closed, but a nature that was acrid, rich, voluptuous, and\nfragrant; the same dreams as in the convent, but with glimpses of young\nmen; a grating, but one that opened on the street.\n\nStill, when she arrived there, we repeat, she was only a child. Jean\nValjean gave this neglected garden over to her. “Do what you like with\nit,” he said to her. This amused Cosette; she turned over all the\nclumps and all the stones, she hunted for “beasts”; she played in it,\nwhile awaiting the time when she would dream in it; she loved this\ngarden for the insects that she found beneath her feet amid the grass,\nwhile awaiting the day when she would love it for the stars that she\nwould see through the boughs above her head.\n\nAnd then, she loved her father, that is to say, Jean Valjean, with all\nher soul, with an innocent filial passion which made the goodman a\nbeloved and charming companion to her. It will be remembered that M.\nMadeleine had been in the habit of reading a great deal. Jean Valjean\nhad continued this practice; he had come to converse well; he possessed\nthe secret riches and the eloquence of a true and humble mind which has\nspontaneously cultivated itself. He retained just enough sharpness to\nseason his kindness; his mind was rough and his heart was soft. During\ntheir conversations in the Luxembourg, he gave her explanations of\neverything, drawing on what he had read, and also on what he had\nsuffered. As she listened to him, Cosette’s eyes wandered vaguely\nabout.\n\nThis simple man sufficed for Cosette’s thought, the same as the wild\ngarden sufficed for her eyes. When she had had a good chase after the\nbutterflies, she came panting up to him and said: “Ah! How I have run!”\nHe kissed her brow.\n\nCosette adored the goodman. She was always at his heels. Where Jean\nValjean was, there happiness was. Jean Valjean lived neither in the\npavilion nor the garden; she took greater pleasure in the paved back\ncourtyard, than in the enclosure filled with flowers, and in his little\nlodge furnished with straw-seated chairs than in the great drawing-room\nhung with tapestry, against which stood tufted easy-chairs. Jean\nValjean sometimes said to her, smiling at his happiness in being\nimportuned: “Do go to your own quarters! Leave me alone a little!”\n\n\nShe gave him those charming and tender scoldings which are so graceful\nwhen they come from a daughter to her father.\n\n“Father, I am very cold in your rooms; why don’t you have a carpet here\nand a stove?”\n\n\n“Dear child, there are so many people who are better than I and who\nhave not even a roof over their heads.”\n\n\n“Then why is there a fire in my rooms, and everything that is needed?”\n\n\n“Because you are a woman and a child.”\n\n\n“Bah! must men be cold and feel uncomfortable?”\n\n\n“Certain men.”\n\n\n“That is good, I shall come here so often that you will be obliged to\nhave a fire.”\n\n\nAnd again she said to him:—\n\n“Father, why do you eat horrible bread like that?”\n\n\n“Because, my daughter.”\n\n\n“Well, if you eat it, I will eat it too.”\n\n\nThen, in order to prevent Cosette eating black bread, Jean Valjean ate\nwhite bread.\n\nCosette had but a confused recollection of her childhood. She prayed\nmorning and evening for her mother whom she had never known. The\nThénardiers had remained with her as two hideous figures in a dream.\nShe remembered that she had gone “one day, at night,” to fetch water in\na forest. She thought that it had been very far from Paris. It seemed\nto her that she had begun to live in an abyss, and that it was Jean\nValjean who had rescued her from it. Her childhood produced upon her\nthe effect of a time when there had been nothing around her but\nmillepeds, spiders, and serpents. When she meditated in the evening,\nbefore falling asleep, as she had not a very clear idea that she was\nJean Valjean’s daughter, and that he was her father, she fancied that\nthe soul of her mother had passed into that good man and had come to\ndwell near her.\n\nWhen he was seated, she leaned her cheek against his white hair, and\ndropped a silent tear, saying to herself: “Perhaps this man is my\nmother.”\n\n\nCosette, although this is a strange statement to make, in the profound\nignorance of a girl brought up in a convent,—maternity being also\nabsolutely unintelligible to virginity,—had ended by fancying that she\nhad had as little mother as possible. She did not even know her\nmother’s name. Whenever she asked Jean Valjean, Jean Valjean remained\nsilent. If she repeated her question, he responded with a smile. Once\nshe insisted; the smile ended in a tear.\n\nThis silence on the part of Jean Valjean covered Fantine with darkness.\n\nWas it prudence? Was it respect? Was it a fear that he should deliver\nthis name to the hazards of another memory than his own?\n\nSo long as Cosette had been small, Jean Valjean had been willing to\ntalk to her of her mother; when she became a young girl, it was\nimpossible for him to do so. It seemed to him that he no longer dared.\nWas it because of Cosette? Was it because of Fantine? He felt a certain\nreligious horror at letting that shadow enter Cosette’s thought; and of\nplacing a third in their destiny. The more sacred this shade was to\nhim, the more did it seem that it was to be feared. He thought of\nFantine, and felt himself overwhelmed with silence.\n\nThrough the darkness, he vaguely perceived something which appeared to\nhave its finger on its lips. Had all the modesty which had been in\nFantine, and which had violently quitted her during her lifetime,\nreturned to rest upon her after her death, to watch in indignation over\nthe peace of that dead woman, and in its shyness, to keep her in her\ngrave? Was Jean Valjean unconsciously submitting to the pressure? We\nwho believe in death, are not among the number who will reject this\nmysterious explanation.\n\nHence the impossibility of uttering, even for Cosette, that name of\nFantine.\n\nOne day Cosette said to him:—\n\n“Father, I saw my mother in a dream last night. She had two big wings.\nMy mother must have been almost a saint during her life.”\n\n\n“Through martyrdom,” replied Jean Valjean.\n\nHowever, Jean Valjean was happy.\n\nWhen Cosette went out with him, she leaned on his arm, proud and happy,\nin the plenitude of her heart. Jean Valjean felt his heart melt within\nhim with delight, at all these sparks of a tenderness so exclusive, so\nwholly satisfied with himself alone. The poor man trembled, inundated\nwith angelic joy; he declared to himself ecstatically that this would\nlast all their lives; he told himself that he really had not suffered\nsufficiently to merit so radiant a bliss, and he thanked God, in the\ndepths of his soul, for having permitted him to be loved thus, he, a\nwretch, by that innocent being.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—THE ROSE PERCEIVES THAT IT IS AN ENGINE OF WAR\n\n\nOne day, Cosette chanced to look at herself in her mirror, and she said\nto herself: “Really!” It seemed to her almost that she was pretty. This\nthrew her in a singularly troubled state of mind. Up to that moment she\nhad never thought of her face. She saw herself in her mirror, but she\ndid not look at herself. And then, she had so often been told that she\nwas homely; Jean Valjean alone said gently: “No indeed! no indeed!” At\nall events, Cosette had always thought herself homely, and had grown up\nin that belief with the easy resignation of childhood. And here, all at\nonce, was her mirror saying to her, as Jean Valjean had said: “No\nindeed!” That night, she did not sleep. “What if I were pretty!” she\nthought. “How odd it would be if I were pretty!” And she recalled those\nof her companions whose beauty had produced a sensation in the convent,\nand she said to herself: “What! Am I to be like Mademoiselle\nSo-and-So?”\n\n\nThe next morning she looked at herself again, not by accident this\ntime, and she was assailed with doubts: “Where did I get such an idea?”\nsaid she; “no, I am ugly.” She had not slept well, that was all, her\neyes were sunken and she was pale. She had not felt very joyous on the\npreceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful, but it made her\nvery sad not to be able to believe in it any longer. She did not look\nat herself again, and for more than a fortnight she tried to dress her\nhair with her back turned to the mirror.\n\nIn the evening, after dinner, she generally embroidered in wool or did\nsome convent needlework in the drawing-room, and Jean Valjean read\nbeside her. Once she raised her eyes from her work, and was rendered\nquite uneasy by the manner in which her father was gazing at her.\n\nOn another occasion, she was passing along the street, and it seemed to\nher that some one behind her, whom she did not see, said: “A pretty\nwoman! but badly dressed.” “Bah!” she thought, “he does not mean me. I\nam well dressed and ugly.” She was then wearing a plush hat and her\nmerino gown.\n\nAt last, one day when she was in the garden, she heard poor old\nToussaint saying: “Do you notice how pretty Cosette is growing, sir?”\nCosette did not hear her father’s reply, but Toussaint’s words caused a\nsort of commotion within her. She fled from the garden, ran up to her\nroom, flew to the looking-glass,—it was three months since she had\nlooked at herself,—and gave vent to a cry. She had just dazzled\nherself.\n\nShe was beautiful and lovely; she could not help agreeing with\nToussaint and her mirror. Her figure was formed, her skin had grown\nwhite, her hair was lustrous, an unaccustomed splendor had been lighted\nin her blue eyes. The consciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an\ninstant, like the sudden advent of daylight; other people noticed it\nalso, Toussaint had said so, it was evidently she of whom the passer-by\nhad spoken, there could no longer be any doubt of that; she descended\nto the garden again, thinking herself a queen, imagining that she heard\nthe birds singing, though it was winter, seeing the sky gilded, the sun\namong the trees, flowers in the thickets, distracted, wild, in\ninexpressible delight.\n\nJean Valjean, on his side, experienced a deep and undefinable\noppression at heart.\n\nIn fact, he had, for some time past, been contemplating with terror\nthat beauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day on Cosette’s\nsweet face. The dawn that was smiling for all was gloomy for him.\n\nCosette had been beautiful for a tolerably long time before she became\naware of it herself. But, from the very first day, that unexpected\nlight which was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young\ngirl’s person, wounded Jean Valjean’s sombre eye. He felt that it was a\nchange in a happy life, a life so happy that he did not dare to move\nfor fear of disarranging something. This man, who had passed through\nall manner of distresses, who was still all bleeding from the bruises\nof fate, who had been almost wicked and who had become almost a saint,\nwho, after having dragged the chain of the galleys, was now dragging\nthe invisible but heavy chain of indefinite misery, this man whom the\nlaw had not released from its grasp and who could be seized at any\nmoment and brought back from the obscurity of his virtue to the broad\ndaylight of public opprobrium, this man accepted all, excused all,\npardoned all, and merely asked of Providence, of man, of the law, of\nsociety, of nature, of the world, one thing, that Cosette might love\nhim!\n\nThat Cosette might continue to love him! That God would not prevent the\nheart of the child from coming to him, and from remaining with him!\nBeloved by Cosette, he felt that he was healed, rested, appeased,\nloaded with benefits, recompensed, crowned. Beloved by Cosette, it was\nwell with him! He asked nothing more! Had any one said to him: “Do you\nwant anything better?” he would have answered: “No.” God might have\nsaid to him: “Do you desire heaven?” and he would have replied: “I\nshould lose by it.”\n\n\nEverything which could affect this situation, if only on the surface,\nmade him shudder like the beginning of something new. He had never\nknown very distinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means; but he\nunderstood instinctively, that it was something terrible.\n\nHe gazed with terror on this beauty, which was blossoming out ever more\ntriumphant and superb beside him, beneath his very eyes, on the\ninnocent and formidable brow of that child, from the depths of her\nhomeliness, of his old age, of his misery, of his reprobation.\n\nHe said to himself: “How beautiful she is! What is to become of me?”\n\n\nThere, moreover, lay the difference between his tenderness and the\ntenderness of a mother. What he beheld with anguish, a mother would\nhave gazed upon with joy.\n\nThe first symptoms were not long in making their appearance.\n\nOn the very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself:\n“Decidedly I am beautiful!” Cosette began to pay attention to her\ntoilet. She recalled the remark of that passer-by: “Pretty, but badly\ndressed,” the breath of an oracle which had passed beside her and had\nvanished, after depositing in her heart one of the two germs which are\ndestined, later on, to fill the whole life of woman, coquetry. Love is\nthe other.\n\nWith faith in her beauty, the whole feminine soul expanded within her.\nShe conceived a horror for her merinos, and shame for her plush hat.\nHer father had never refused her anything. She at once acquired the\nwhole science of the bonnet, the gown, the mantle, the boot, the cuff,\nthe stuff which is in fashion, the color which is becoming, that\nscience which makes of the Parisian woman something so charming, so\ndeep, and so dangerous. The words _heady woman_ were invented for the\nParisienne.\n\nIn less than a month, little Cosette, in that Thebaid of the Rue de\nBabylone, was not only one of the prettiest, but one of the “best\ndressed” women in Paris, which means a great deal more.\n\nShe would have liked to encounter her “passer-by,” to see what he would\nsay, and to “teach him a lesson!” The truth is, that she was ravishing\nin every respect, and that she distinguished the difference between a\nbonnet from Gérard and one from Herbaut in the most marvellous way.\n\nJean Valjean watched these ravages with anxiety. He who felt that he\ncould never do anything but crawl, walk at the most, beheld wings\nsprouting on Cosette.\n\nMoreover, from the mere inspection of Cosette’s toilet, a woman would\nhave recognized the fact that she had no mother. Certain little\nproprieties, certain special conventionalities, were not observed by\nCosette. A mother, for instance, would have told her that a young girl\ndoes not dress in damask.\n\nThe first day that Cosette went out in her black damask gown and\nmantle, and her white crape bonnet, she took Jean Valjean’s arm, gay,\nradiant, rosy, proud, dazzling. “Father,” she said, “how do you like me\nin this guise?” Jean Valjean replied in a voice which resembled the\nbitter voice of an envious man: “Charming!” He was the same as usual\nduring their walk. On their return home, he asked Cosette:—\n\n“Won’t you put on that other gown and bonnet again,—you know the ones I\nmean?”\n\n\nThis took place in Cosette’s chamber. Cosette turned towards the\nwardrobe where her cast-off schoolgirl’s clothes were hanging.\n\n“That disguise!” said she. “Father, what do you want me to do with it?\nOh no, the idea! I shall never put on those horrors again. With that\nmachine on my head, I have the air of Madame Mad-dog.”\n\n\nJean Valjean heaved a deep sigh.\n\nFrom that moment forth, he noticed that Cosette, who had always\nheretofore asked to remain at home, saying: “Father, I enjoy myself\nmore here with you,” now was always asking to go out. In fact, what is\nthe use of having a handsome face and a delicious costume if one does\nnot display them?\n\nHe also noticed that Cosette had no longer the same taste for the back\ngarden. Now she preferred the garden, and did not dislike to promenade\nback and forth in front of the railed fence. Jean Valjean, who was shy,\nnever set foot in the garden. He kept to his back yard, like a dog.\n\nCosette, in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful, lost the\ngrace of ignoring it. An exquisite grace, for beauty enhanced by\ningenuousness is ineffable, and nothing is so adorable as a dazzling\nand innocent creature who walks along, holding in her hand the key to\nparadise without being conscious of it. But what she had lost in\ningenuous grace, she gained in pensive and serious charm. Her whole\nperson, permeated with the joy of youth, of innocence, and of beauty,\nbreathed forth a splendid melancholy.\n\nIt was at this epoch that Marius, after the lapse of six months, saw\nher once more at the Luxembourg.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—THE BATTLE BEGUN\n\n\nCosette in her shadow, like Marius in his, was all ready to take fire.\nDestiny, with its mysterious and fatal patience, slowly drew together\nthese two beings, all charged and all languishing with the stormy\nelectricity of passion, these two souls which were laden with love as\ntwo clouds are laden with lightning, and which were bound to overflow\nand mingle in a look like the clouds in a flash of fire.\n\nThe glance has been so much abused in love romances that it has finally\nfallen into disrepute. One hardly dares to say, nowadays, that two\nbeings fell in love because they looked at each other. That is the way\npeople do fall in love, nevertheless, and the only way. The rest is\nnothing, but the rest comes afterwards. Nothing is more real than these\ngreat shocks which two souls convey to each other by the exchange of\nthat spark.\n\nAt that particular hour when Cosette unconsciously darted that glance\nwhich troubled Marius, Marius had no suspicion that he had also\nlaunched a look which disturbed Cosette.\n\nHe caused her the same good and the same evil.\n\nShe had been in the habit of seeing him for a long time, and she had\nscrutinized him as girls scrutinize and see, while looking elsewhere.\nMarius still considered Cosette ugly, when she had already begun to\nthink Marius handsome. But as he paid no attention to her, the young\nman was nothing to her.\n\nStill, she could not refrain from saying to herself that he had\nbeautiful hair, beautiful eyes, handsome teeth, a charming tone of\nvoice when she heard him conversing with his comrades, that he held\nhimself badly when he walked, if you like, but with a grace that was\nall his own, that he did not appear to be at all stupid, that his whole\nperson was noble, gentle, simple, proud, and that, in short, though he\nseemed to be poor, yet his air was fine.\n\nOn the day when their eyes met at last, and said to each other those\nfirst, obscure, and ineffable things which the glance lisps, Cosette\ndid not immediately understand. She returned thoughtfully to the house\nin the Rue de l’Ouest, where Jean Valjean, according to his custom, had\ncome to spend six weeks. The next morning, on waking, she thought of\nthat strange young man, so long indifferent and icy, who now seemed to\npay attention to her, and it did not appear to her that this attention\nwas the least in the world agreeable to her. She was, on the contrary,\nsomewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful individual. A\nsubstratum of war stirred within her. It struck her, and the idea\ncaused her a wholly childish joy, that she was going to take her\nrevenge at last.\n\nKnowing that she was beautiful, she was thoroughly conscious, though in\nan indistinct fashion, that she possessed a weapon. Women play with\ntheir beauty as children do with a knife. They wound themselves.\n\nThe reader will recall Marius’ hesitations, his palpitations, his\nterrors. He remained on his bench and did not approach. This vexed\nCosette. One day, she said to Jean Valjean: “Father, let us stroll\nabout a little in that direction.” Seeing that Marius did not come to\nher, she went to him. In such cases, all women resemble Mahomet. And\nthen, strange to say, the first symptom of true love in a young man is\ntimidity; in a young girl it is boldness. This is surprising, and yet\nnothing is more simple. It is the two sexes tending to approach each\nother and assuming, each the other’s qualities.\n\nThat day, Cosette’s glance drove Marius beside himself, and Marius’\nglance set Cosette to trembling. Marius went away confident, and\nCosette uneasy. From that day forth, they adored each other.\n\nThe first thing that Cosette felt was a confused and profound\nmelancholy. It seemed to her that her soul had become black since the\nday before. She no longer recognized it. The whiteness of soul in young\ngirls, which is composed of coldness and gayety, resembles snow. It\nmelts in love, which is its sun.\n\nCosette did not know what love was. She had never heard the word\nuttered in its terrestrial sense. On the books of profane music which\nentered the convent, _amour_ (love) was replaced by _tambour_ (drum) or\n_pandour_. This created enigmas which exercised the imaginations of the\n_big girls_, such as: _Ah, how delightful is the drum! _ or, _Pity is\nnot a pandour_. But Cosette had left the convent too early to have\noccupied herself much with the “drum.” Therefore, she did not know what\nname to give to what she now felt. Is any one the less ill because one\ndoes not know the name of one’s malady?\n\nShe loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly. She\ndid not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing, useful or\ndangerous, eternal or temporary, allowable or prohibited; she loved.\nShe would have been greatly astonished, had any one said to her: “You\ndo not sleep? But that is forbidden! You do not eat? Why, that is very\nbad! You have oppressions and palpitations of the heart? That must not\nbe! You blush and turn pale, when a certain being clad in black appears\nat the end of a certain green walk? But that is abominable!” She would\nnot have understood, and she would have replied: “What fault is there\nof mine in a matter in which I have no power and of which I know\nnothing?”\n\n\nIt turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly suited\nto the state of her soul. It was a sort of admiration at a distance, a\nmute contemplation, the deification of a stranger. It was the\napparition of youth to youth, the dream of nights become a reality yet\nremaining a dream, the longed-for phantom realized and made flesh at\nlast, but having as yet, neither name, nor fault, nor spot, nor\nexigence, nor defect; in a word, the distant lover who lingered in the\nideal, a chimæra with a form. Any nearer and more palpable meeting\nwould have alarmed Cosette at this first stage, when she was still half\nimmersed in the exaggerated mists of the cloister. She had all the\nfears of children and all the fears of nuns combined. The spirit of the\nconvent, with which she had been permeated for the space of five years,\nwas still in the process of slow evaporation from her person, and made\neverything tremble around her. In this situation he was not a lover, he\nwas not even an admirer, he was a vision. She set herself to adoring\nMarius as something charming, luminous, and impossible.\n\nAs extreme innocence borders on extreme coquetry, she smiled at him\nwith all frankness.\n\nEvery day, she looked forward to the hour for their walk with\nimpatience, she found Marius there, she felt herself unspeakably happy,\nand thought in all sincerity that she was expressing her whole thought\nwhen she said to Jean Valjean:—\n\n“What a delicious garden that Luxembourg is!”\n\n\nMarius and Cosette were in the dark as to one another. They did not\naddress each other, they did not salute each other, they did not know\neach other; they saw each other; and like stars of heaven which are\nseparated by millions of leagues, they lived by gazing at each other.\n\nIt was thus that Cosette gradually became a woman and developed,\nbeautiful and loving, with a consciousness of her beauty, and in\nignorance of her love. She was a coquette to boot through her\nignorance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—TO ONE SADNESS OPPOSE A SADNESS AND A HALF\n\n\nAll situations have their instincts. Old and eternal Mother Nature\nwarned Jean Valjean in a dim way of the presence of Marius. Jean\nValjean shuddered to the very bottom of his soul. Jean Valjean saw\nnothing, knew nothing, and yet he scanned with obstinate attention, the\ndarkness in which he walked, as though he felt on one side of him\nsomething in process of construction, and on the other, something which\nwas crumbling away. Marius, also warned, and, in accordance with the\ndeep law of God, by that same Mother Nature, did all he could to keep\nout of sight of “the father.” Nevertheless, it came to pass that Jean\nValjean sometimes espied him. Marius’ manners were no longer in the\nleast natural. He exhibited ambiguous prudence and awkward daring. He\nno longer came quite close to them as formerly. He seated himself at a\ndistance and pretended to be reading; why did he pretend that? Formerly\nhe had come in his old coat, now he wore his new one every day; Jean\nValjean was not sure that he did not have his hair curled, his eyes\nwere very queer, he wore gloves; in short, Jean Valjean cordially\ndetested this young man.\n\nCosette allowed nothing to be divined. Without knowing just what was\nthe matter with her she was convinced that there was something in it,\nand that it must be concealed.\n\nThere was a coincidence between the taste for the toilet which had\nrecently come to Cosette, and the habit of new clothes developed by\nthat stranger which was very repugnant to Jean Valjean. It might be\naccidental, no doubt, certainly, but it was a menacing accident.\n\nHe never opened his mouth to Cosette about this stranger. One day,\nhowever, he could not refrain from so doing, and, with that vague\ndespair which suddenly casts the lead into the depths of its despair,\nhe said to her: “What a very pedantic air that young man has!”\n\n\nCosette, but a year before only an indifferent little girl, would have\nreplied: “Why, no, he is charming.” Ten years later, with the love of\nMarius in her heart, she would have answered: “A pedant, and\ninsufferable to the sight! You are right!”—At the moment in life and\nthe heart which she had then attained, she contented herself with\nreplying, with supreme calmness: “That young man!”\n\n\nAs though she now beheld him for the first time in her life.\n\n“How stupid I am!” thought Jean Valjean. “She had not noticed him. It\nis I who have pointed him out to her.”\n\n\nOh, simplicity of the old! oh, the depth of children!\n\nIt is one of the laws of those fresh years of suffering and trouble, of\nthose vivacious conflicts between a first love and the first obstacles,\nthat the young girl does not allow herself to be caught in any trap\nwhatever, and that the young man falls into every one. Jean Valjean had\ninstituted an undeclared war against Marius, which Marius, with the\nsublime stupidity of his passion and his age, did not divine. Jean\nValjean laid a host of ambushes for him; he changed his hour, he\nchanged his bench, he forgot his handkerchief, he came alone to the\nLuxembourg; Marius dashed headlong into all these snares; and to all\nthe interrogation marks planted by Jean Valjean in his pathway, he\ningenuously answered “yes.” But Cosette remained immured in her\napparent unconcern and in her imperturbable tranquillity, so that Jean\nValjean arrived at the following conclusion: “That ninny is madly in\nlove with Cosette, but Cosette does not even know that he exists.”\n\n\nNonetheless did he bear in his heart a mournful tremor. The minute when\nCosette would love might strike at any moment. Does not everything\nbegin with indifference?\n\nOnly once did Cosette make a mistake and alarm him. He rose from his\nseat to depart, after a stay of three hours, and she said: “What,\nalready?”\n\n\nJean Valjean had not discontinued his trips to the Luxembourg, as he\ndid not wish to do anything out of the way, and as, above all things,\nhe feared to arouse Cosette; but during the hours which were so sweet\nto the lovers, while Cosette was sending her smile to the intoxicated\nMarius, who perceived nothing else now, and who now saw nothing in all\nthe world but an adored and radiant face, Jean Valjean was fixing on\nMarius flashing and terrible eyes. He, who had finally come to believe\nhimself incapable of a malevolent feeling, experienced moments when\nMarius was present, in which he thought he was becoming savage and\nferocious once more, and he felt the old depths of his soul, which had\nformerly contained so much wrath, opening once more and rising up\nagainst that young man. It almost seemed to him that unknown craters\nwere forming in his bosom.\n\nWhat! he was there, that creature! What was he there for? He came\ncreeping about, smelling out, examining, trying! He came, saying: “Hey!\nWhy not?” He came to prowl about his, Jean Valjean’s, life! to prowl\nabout his happiness, with the purpose of seizing it and bearing it\naway!\n\nJean Valjean added: “Yes, that’s it! What is he in search of? An\nadventure! What does he want? A love affair! A love affair! And I?\nWhat! I have been first, the most wretched of men, and then the most\nunhappy, and I have traversed sixty years of life on my knees, I have\nsuffered everything that man can suffer, I have grown old without\nhaving been young, I have lived without a family, without relatives,\nwithout friends, without life, without children, I have left my blood\non every stone, on every bramble, on every mile-post, along every wall,\nI have been gentle, though others have been hard to me, and kind,\nalthough others have been malicious, I have become an honest man once\nmore, in spite of everything, I have repented of the evil that I have\ndone and have forgiven the evil that has been done to me, and at the\nmoment when I receive my recompense, at the moment when it is all over,\nat the moment when I am just touching the goal, at the moment when I\nhave what I desire, it is well, it is good, I have paid, I have earned\nit, all this is to take flight, all this will vanish, and I shall lose\nCosette, and I shall lose my life, my joy, my soul, because it has\npleased a great booby to come and lounge at the Luxembourg.”\n\n\nThen his eyes were filled with a sad and extraordinary gleam.\n\nIt was no longer a man gazing at a man; it was no longer an enemy\nsurveying an enemy. It was a dog scanning a thief.\n\nThe reader knows the rest. Marius pursued his senseless course. One day\nhe followed Cosette to the Rue de l’Ouest. Another day he spoke to the\nporter. The porter, on his side, spoke, and said to Jean Valjean:\n“Monsieur, who is that curious young man who is asking for you?” On the\nmorrow Jean Valjean bestowed on Marius that glance which Marius at last\nperceived. A week later, Jean Valjean had taken his departure. He swore\nto himself that he would never again set foot either in the Luxembourg\nor in the Rue de l’Ouest. He returned to the Rue Plumet.\n\nCosette did not complain, she said nothing, she asked no questions, she\ndid not seek to learn his reasons; she had already reached the point\nwhere she was afraid of being divined, and of betraying herself. Jean\nValjean had no experience of these miseries, the only miseries which\nare charming and the only ones with which he was not acquainted; the\nconsequence was that he did not understand the grave significance of\nCosette’s silence.\n\nHe merely noticed that she had grown sad, and he grew gloomy. On his\nside and on hers, inexperience had joined issue.\n\nOnce he made a trial. He asked Cosette:—\n\n“Would you like to come to the Luxembourg?”\n\n\nA ray illuminated Cosette’s pale face.\n\n“Yes,” said she.\n\nThey went thither. Three months had elapsed. Marius no longer went\nthere. Marius was not there.\n\nOn the following day, Jean Valjean asked Cosette again:—\n\n“Would you like to come to the Luxembourg?”\n\n\nShe replied, sadly and gently:—\n\n“No.”\n\n\nJean Valjean was hurt by this sadness, and heart-broken at this\ngentleness.\n\nWhat was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so\nimpenetrable? What was on its way there within? What was taking place\nin Cosette’s soul? Sometimes, instead of going to bed, Jean Valjean\nremained seated on his pallet, with his head in his hands, and he\npassed whole nights asking himself: “What has Cosette in her mind?” and\nin thinking of the things that she might be thinking about.\n\nOh! at such moments, what mournful glances did he cast towards that\ncloister, that chaste peak, that abode of angels, that inaccessible\nglacier of virtue! How he contemplated, with despairing ecstasy, that\nconvent garden, full of ignored flowers and cloistered virgins, where\nall perfumes and all souls mount straight to heaven! How he adored that\nEden forever closed against him, whence he had voluntarily and madly\nemerged! How he regretted his abnegation and his folly in having\nbrought Cosette back into the world, poor hero of sacrifice, seized and\nhurled to the earth by his very self-devotion! How he said to himself,\n“What have I done?”\n\n\nHowever, nothing of all this was perceptible to Cosette. No ill-temper,\nno harshness. His face was always serene and kind. Jean Valjean’s\nmanners were more tender and more paternal than ever. If anything could\nhave betrayed his lack of joy, it was his increased suavity.\n\nOn her side, Cosette languished. She suffered from the absence of\nMarius as she had rejoiced in his presence, peculiarly, without exactly\nbeing conscious of it. When Jean Valjean ceased to take her on their\ncustomary strolls, a feminine instinct murmured confusedly, at the\nbottom of her heart, that she must not seem to set store on the\nLuxembourg garden, and that if this proved to be a matter of\nindifference to her, her father would take her thither once more. But\ndays, weeks, months, elapsed. Jean Valjean had tacitly accepted\nCosette’s tacit consent. She regretted it. It was too late. So Marius\nhad disappeared; all was over. The day on which she returned to the\nLuxembourg, Marius was no longer there. What was to be done? Should she\never find him again? She felt an anguish at her heart, which nothing\nrelieved, and which augmented every day; she no longer knew whether it\nwas winter or summer, whether it was raining or shining, whether the\nbirds were singing, whether it was the season for dahlias or daisies,\nwhether the Luxembourg was more charming than the Tuileries, whether\nthe linen which the laundress brought home was starched too much or not\nenough, whether Toussaint had done “her marketing” well or ill; and she\nremained dejected, absorbed, attentive to but a single thought, her\neyes vague and staring as when one gazes by night at a black and\nfathomless spot where an apparition has vanished.\n\nHowever, she did not allow Jean Valjean to perceive anything of this,\nexcept her pallor.\n\nShe still wore her sweet face for him.\n\nThis pallor sufficed but too thoroughly to trouble Jean Valjean.\nSometimes he asked her:—\n\n“What is the matter with you?”\n\n\nShe replied: “There is nothing the matter with me.”\n\n\nAnd after a silence, when she divined that he was sad also, she would\nadd:—\n\n“And you, father—is there anything wrong with you?”\n\n\n“With me? Nothing,” said he.\n\nThese two beings who had loved each other so exclusively, and with so\ntouching an affection, and who had lived so long for each other now\nsuffered side by side, each on the other’s account; without\nacknowledging it to each other, without anger towards each other, and\nwith a smile.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—THE CHAIN-GANG\n\n\nJean Valjean was the more unhappy of the two. Youth, even in its\nsorrows, always possesses its own peculiar radiance.\n\nAt times, Jean Valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile. It\nis the property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear.\nHe had an unconquerable conviction that Cosette was escaping from him.\nHe would have liked to resist, to retain her, to arouse her enthusiasm\nby some external and brilliant matter. These ideas, puerile, as we have\njust said, and at the same time senile, conveyed to him, by their very\nchildishness, a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on\nthe imaginations of young girls. He once chanced to see a general on\nhorseback, in full uniform, pass along the street, Comte Coutard, the\ncommandant of Paris. He envied that gilded man; what happiness it would\nbe, he said to himself, if he could put on that suit which was an\nincontestable thing; and if Cosette could behold him thus, she would be\ndazzled, and when he had Cosette on his arm and passed the gates of the\nTuileries, the guard would present arms to him, and that would suffice\nfor Cosette, and would dispel her idea of looking at young men.\n\nAn unforeseen shock was added to these sad reflections.\n\nIn the isolated life which they led, and since they had come to dwell\nin the Rue Plumet, they had contracted one habit. They sometimes took a\npleasure trip to see the sun rise, a mild species of enjoyment which\nbefits those who are entering life and those who are quitting it.\n\nFor those who love solitude, a walk in the early morning is equivalent\nto a stroll by night, with the cheerfulness of nature added. The\nstreets are deserted and the birds are singing. Cosette, a bird\nherself, liked to rise early. These matutinal excursions were planned\non the preceding evening. He proposed, and she agreed. It was arranged\nlike a plot, they set out before daybreak, and these trips were so many\nsmall delights for Cosette. These innocent eccentricities please young\npeople.\n\nJean Valjean’s inclination led him, as we have seen, to the least\nfrequented spots, to solitary nooks, to forgotten places. There then\nexisted, in the vicinity of the barriers of Paris, a sort of poor\nmeadows, which were almost confounded with the city, where grew in\nsummer sickly grain, and which, in autumn, after the harvest had been\ngathered, presented the appearance, not of having been reaped, but\npeeled. Jean Valjean loved to haunt these fields. Cosette was not bored\nthere. It meant solitude to him and liberty to her. There, she became a\nlittle girl once more, she could run and almost play; she took off her\nhat, laid it on Jean Valjean’s knees, and gathered bunches of flowers.\nShe gazed at the butterflies on the flowers, but did not catch them;\ngentleness and tenderness are born with love, and the young girl who\ncherishes within her breast a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on\nthe wing of a butterfly. She wove garlands of poppies, which she placed\non her head, and which, crossed and penetrated with sunlight, glowing\nuntil they flamed, formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers.\n\nEven after their life had grown sad, they kept up their custom of early\nstrolls.\n\nOne morning in October, therefore, tempted by the serene perfection of\nthe autumn of 1831, they set out, and found themselves at break of day\nnear the Barrière du Maine. It was not dawn, it was daybreak; a\ndelightful and stern moment. A few constellations here and there in the\ndeep, pale azure, the earth all black, the heavens all white, a quiver\namid the blades of grass, everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight.\nA lark, which seemed mingled with the stars, was carolling at a\nprodigious height, and one would have declared that that hymn of\npettiness calmed immensity. In the East, the Val-de-Grâce projected its\ndark mass on the clear horizon with the sharpness of steel; Venus\ndazzlingly brilliant was rising behind that dome and had the air of a\nsoul making its escape from a gloomy edifice.\n\nAll was peace and silence; there was no one on the road; a few stray\nlaborers, of whom they caught barely a glimpse, were on their way to\ntheir work along the side-paths.\n\nJean Valjean was sitting in a cross-walk on some planks deposited at\nthe gate of a timber-yard. His face was turned towards the highway, his\nback towards the light; he had forgotten the sun which was on the point\nof rising; he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which\nthe mind becomes concentrated, which imprison even the eye, and which\nare equivalent to four walls. There are meditations which may be called\nvertical; when one is at the bottom of them, time is required to return\nto earth. Jean Valjean had plunged into one of these reveries. He was\nthinking of Cosette, of the happiness that was possible if nothing came\nbetween him and her, of the light with which she filled his life, a\nlight which was but the emanation of her soul. He was almost happy in\nhis reverie. Cosette, who was standing beside him, was gazing at the\nclouds as they turned rosy.\n\nAll at once Cosette exclaimed: “Father, I should think some one was\ncoming yonder.” Jean Valjean raised his eyes.\n\nCosette was right. The causeway which leads to the ancient Barrière du\nMaine is a prolongation, as the reader knows, of the Rue de Sèvres, and\nis cut at right angles by the inner boulevard. At the elbow of the\ncauseway and the boulevard, at the spot where it branches, they heard a\nnoise which it was difficult to account for at that hour, and a sort of\nconfused pile made its appearance. Some shapeless thing which was\ncoming from the boulevard was turning into the road.\n\nIt grew larger, it seemed to move in an orderly manner, though it was\nbristling and quivering; it seemed to be a vehicle, but its load could\nnot be distinctly made out. There were horses, wheels, shouts; whips\nwere cracking. By degrees the outlines became fixed, although bathed in\nshadows. It was a vehicle, in fact, which had just turned from the\nboulevard into the highway, and which was directing its course towards\nthe barrier near which sat Jean Valjean; a second, of the same aspect,\nfollowed, then a third, then a fourth; seven chariots made their\nappearance in succession, the heads of the horses touching the rear of\nthe wagon in front. Figures were moving on these vehicles, flashes were\nvisible through the dusk as though there were naked swords there, a\nclanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains, and as\nthis something advanced, the sound of voices waxed louder, and it\nturned into a terrible thing such as emerges from the cave of dreams.\n\nAs it drew nearer, it assumed a form, and was outlined behind the trees\nwith the pallid hue of an apparition; the mass grew white; the day,\nwhich was slowly dawning, cast a wan light on this swarming heap which\nwas at once both sepulchral and living, the heads of the figures turned\ninto the faces of corpses, and this is what it proved to be:—\n\nSeven wagons were driving in a file along the road. The first six were\nsingularly constructed. They resembled coopers’ drays; they consisted\nof long ladders placed on two wheels and forming barrows at their rear\nextremities. Each dray, or rather let us say, each ladder, was attached\nto four horses harnessed tandem. On these ladders strange clusters of\nmen were being drawn. In the faint light, these men were to be divined\nrather than seen. Twenty-four on each vehicle, twelve on a side, back\nto back, facing the passers-by, their legs dangling in the air,—this\nwas the manner in which these men were travelling, and behind their\nbacks they had something which clanked, and which was a chain, and on\ntheir necks something which shone, and which was an iron collar. Each\nman had his collar, but the chain was for all; so that if these four\nand twenty men had occasion to alight from the dray and walk, they were\nseized with a sort of inexorable unity, and were obliged to wind over\nthe ground with the chain for a backbone, somewhat after the fashion of\nmillepeds. In the back and front of each vehicle, two men armed with\nmuskets stood erect, each holding one end of the chain under his foot.\nThe iron necklets were square. The seventh vehicle, a huge rack-sided\nbaggage wagon, without a hood, had four wheels and six horses, and\ncarried a sonorous pile of iron boilers, cast-iron pots, braziers, and\nchains, among which were mingled several men who were pinioned and\nstretched at full length, and who seemed to be ill. This wagon, all\nlattice-work, was garnished with dilapidated hurdles which appeared to\nhave served for former punishments. These vehicles kept to the middle\nof the road. On each side marched a double hedge of guards of infamous\naspect, wearing three-cornered hats, like the soldiers under the\nDirectory, shabby, covered with spots and holes, muffled in uniforms of\nveterans and the trousers of undertakers’ men, half gray, half blue,\nwhich were almost hanging in rags, with red epaulets, yellow shoulder\nbelts, short sabres, muskets, and cudgels; they were a species of\nsoldier-blackguards. These myrmidons seemed composed of the abjectness\nof the beggar and the authority of the executioner. The one who\nappeared to be their chief held a postilion’s whip in his hand. All\nthese details, blurred by the dimness of dawn, became more and more\nclearly outlined as the light increased. At the head and in the rear of\nthe convoy rode mounted gendarmes, serious and with sword in fist.\n\nThis procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached the\nbarrier, the last was barely debauching from the boulevard. A throng,\nsprung, it is impossible to say whence, and formed in a twinkling, as\nis frequently the case in Paris, pressed forward from both sides of the\nroad and looked on. In the neighboring lanes the shouts of people\ncalling to each other and the wooden shoes of market-gardeners\nhastening up to gaze were audible.\n\nThe men massed upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted along in\nsilence. They were livid with the chill of morning. They all wore linen\ntrousers, and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes. The rest\nof their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness. Their accoutrements\nwere horribly incongruous; nothing is more funereal than the harlequin\nin rags. Battered felt hats, tarpaulin caps, hideous woollen nightcaps,\nand, side by side with a short blouse, a black coat broken at the\nelbow; many wore women’s headgear, others had baskets on their heads;\nhairy breasts were visible, and through the rent in their garments\ntattooed designs could be descried; temples of Love, flaming hearts,\nCupids; eruptions and unhealthy red blotches could also be seen. Two or\nthree had a straw rope attached to the cross-bar of the dray, and\nsuspended under them like a stirrup, which supported their feet. One of\nthem held in his hand and raised to his mouth something which had the\nappearance of a black stone and which he seemed to be gnawing; it was\nbread which he was eating. There were no eyes there which were not\neither dry, dulled, or flaming with an evil light. The escort troop\ncursed, the men in chains did not utter a syllable; from time to time\nthe sound of a blow became audible as the cudgels descended on\nshoulder-blades or skulls; some of these men were yawning; their rags\nwere terrible; their feet hung down, their shoulders oscillated, their\nheads clashed together, their fetters clanked, their eyes glared\nferociously, their fists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands\nof corpses; in the rear of the convoy ran a band of children screaming\nwith laughter.\n\nThis file of vehicles, whatever its nature was, was mournful. It was\nevident that to-morrow, that an hour hence, a pouring rain might\ndescend, that it might be followed by another and another, and that\ntheir dilapidated garments would be drenched, that once soaked, these\nmen would not get dry again, that once chilled, they would not again\nget warm, that their linen trousers would be glued to their bones by\nthe downpour, that the water would fill their shoes, that no lashes\nfrom the whips would be able to prevent their jaws from chattering,\nthat the chain would continue to bind them by the neck, that their legs\nwould continue to dangle, and it was impossible not to shudder at the\nsight of these human beings thus bound and passive beneath the cold\nclouds of autumn, and delivered over to the rain, to the blast, to all\nthe furies of the air, like trees and stones.\n\nBlows from the cudgel were not omitted even in the case of the sick\nmen, who lay there knotted with ropes and motionless on the seventh\nwagon, and who appeared to have been tossed there like sacks filled\nwith misery.\n\nSuddenly, the sun made its appearance; the immense light of the Orient\nburst forth, and one would have said that it had set fire to all those\nferocious heads. Their tongues were unloosed; a conflagration of grins,\noaths, and songs exploded. The broad horizontal sheet of light severed\nthe file in two parts, illuminating heads and bodies, leaving feet and\nwheels in the obscurity. Thoughts made their appearance on these faces;\nit was a terrible moment; visible demons with their masks removed,\nfierce souls laid bare. Though lighted up, this wild throng remained in\ngloom. Some, who were gay, had in their mouths quills through which\nthey blew vermin over the crowd, picking out the women; the dawn\naccentuated these lamentable profiles with the blackness of its\nshadows; there was not one of these creatures who was not deformed by\nreason of wretchedness; and the whole was so monstrous that one would\nhave said that the sun’s brilliancy had been changed into the glare of\nthe lightning. The wagon-load which headed the line had struck up a\nsong, and were shouting at the top of their voices with a haggard\njoviality, a pot-pourri by Desaugiers, then famous, called _The\nVestal_; the trees shivered mournfully; in the cross-lanes,\ncountenances of bourgeois listened in an idiotic delight to these\ncoarse strains droned by spectres.\n\nAll sorts of distress met in this procession as in chaos; here were to\nbe found the facial angles of every sort of beast, old men, youths,\nbald heads, gray beards, cynical monstrosities, sour resignation,\nsavage grins, senseless attitudes, snouts surmounted by caps, heads\nlike those of young girls with corkscrew curls on the temples,\ninfantile visages, and by reason of that, horrible thin skeleton faces,\nto which death alone was lacking. On the first cart was a negro, who\nhad been a slave, in all probability, and who could make a comparison\nof his chains. The frightful leveller from below, shame, had passed\nover these brows; at that degree of abasement, the last transformations\nwere suffered by all in their extremest depths, and ignorance,\nconverted into dulness, was the equal of intelligence converted into\ndespair. There was no choice possible between these men who appeared to\nthe eye as the flower of the mud. It was evident that the person who\nhad had the ordering of that unclean procession had not classified\nthem. These beings had been fettered and coupled pell-mell, in\nalphabetical disorder, probably, and loaded hap-hazard on those carts.\nNevertheless, horrors, when grouped together, always end by evolving a\nresult; all additions of wretched men give a sum total, each chain\nexhaled a common soul, and each dray-load had its own physiognomy. By\nthe side of the one where they were singing, there was one where they\nwere howling; a third where they were begging; one could be seen in\nwhich they were gnashing their teeth; another load menaced the\nspectators, another blasphemed God; the last was as silent as the tomb.\nDante would have thought that he beheld his seven circles of hell on\nthe march. The march of the damned to their tortures, performed in\nsinister wise, not on the formidable and flaming chariot of the\nApocalypse, but, what was more mournful than that, on the gibbet cart.\n\nOne of the guards, who had a hook on the end of his cudgel, made a\npretence from time to time, of stirring up this mass of human filth. An\nold woman in the crowd pointed them out to her little boy five years\nold, and said to him: “Rascal, let that be a warning to you!”\n\n\nAs the songs and blasphemies increased, the man who appeared to be the\ncaptain of the escort cracked his whip, and at that signal a fearful\ndull and blind flogging, which produced the sound of hail, fell upon\nthe seven dray-loads; many roared and foamed at the mouth; which\nredoubled the delight of the street urchins who had hastened up, a\nswarm of flies on these wounds.\n\nJean Valjean’s eyes had assumed a frightful expression. They were no\nlonger eyes; they were those deep and glassy objects which replace the\nglance in the case of certain wretched men, which seem unconscious of\nreality, and in which flames the reflection of terrors and of\ncatastrophes. He was not looking at a spectacle, he was seeing a\nvision. He tried to rise, to flee, to make his escape; he could not\nmove his feet. Sometimes, the things that you see seize upon you and\nhold you fast. He remained nailed to the spot, petrified, stupid,\nasking himself, athwart confused and inexpressible anguish, what this\nsepulchral persecution signified, and whence had come that pandemonium\nwhich was pursuing him. All at once, he raised his hand to his brow, a\ngesture habitual to those whose memory suddenly returns; he remembered\nthat this was, in fact, the usual itinerary, that it was customary to\nmake this detour in order to avoid all possibility of encountering\nroyalty on the road to Fontainebleau, and that, five and thirty years\nbefore, he had himself passed through that barrier.\n\nCosette was no less terrified, but in a different way. She did not\nunderstand; what she beheld did not seem to her to be possible; at\nlength she cried:—\n\n“Father! What are those men in those carts?”\n\n\nJean Valjean replied: “Convicts.”\n\n\n“Whither are they going?”\n\n\n“To the galleys.”\n\n\nAt that moment, the cudgelling, multiplied by a hundred hands, became\nzealous, blows with the flat of the sword were mingled with it, it was\na perfect storm of whips and clubs; the convicts bent before it, a\nhideous obedience was evoked by the torture, and all held their peace,\ndarting glances like chained wolves.\n\nCosette trembled in every limb; she resumed:—\n\n“Father, are they still men?”\n\n\n“Sometimes,” answered the unhappy man.\n\nIt was the chain-gang, in fact, which had set out before daybreak from\nBicêtre, and had taken the road to Mans in order to avoid\nFontainebleau, where the King then was. This caused the horrible\njourney to last three or four days longer; but torture may surely be\nprolonged with the object of sparing the royal personage a sight of it.\n\nJean Valjean returned home utterly overwhelmed. Such encounters are\nshocks, and the memory that they leave behind them resembles a thorough\nshaking up.\n\nNevertheless, Jean Valjean did not observe that, on his way back to the\nRue de Babylone with Cosette, the latter was plying him with other\nquestions on the subject of what they had just seen; perhaps he was too\nmuch absorbed in his own dejection to notice her words and reply to\nthem. But when Cosette was leaving him in the evening, to betake\nherself to bed, he heard her say in a low voice, and as though talking\nto herself: “It seems to me, that if I were to find one of those men in\nmy pathway, oh, my God, I should die merely from the sight of him close\nat hand.”\n\n\nFortunately, chance ordained that on the morrow of that tragic day,\nthere was some official solemnity apropos of I know not what,—fêtes in\nParis, a review in the Champ de Mars, jousts on the Seine, theatrical\nperformances in the Champs-Élysées, fireworks at the Arc de l‘Étoile,\nilluminations everywhere. Jean Valjean did violence to his habits, and\ntook Cosette to see these rejoicings, for the purpose of diverting her\nfrom the memory of the day before, and of effacing, beneath the smiling\ntumult of all Paris, the abominable thing which had passed before her.\nThe review with which the festival was spiced made the presence of\nuniforms perfectly natural; Jean Valjean donned his uniform of a\nnational guard with the vague inward feeling of a man who is betaking\nhimself to shelter. However, this trip seemed to attain its object.\nCosette, who made it her law to please her father, and to whom,\nmoreover, all spectacles were a novelty, accepted this diversion with\nthe light and easy good grace of youth, and did not pout too\ndisdainfully at that flutter of enjoyment called a public fête; so that\nJean Valjean was able to believe that he had succeeded, and that no\ntrace of that hideous vision remained.\n\nSome days later, one morning, when the sun was shining brightly, and\nthey were both on the steps leading to the garden, another infraction\nof the rules which Jean Valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself,\nand to the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had\ncaused Cosette to adopt, Cosette, in a wrapper, was standing erect in\nthat negligent attire of early morning which envelops young girls in an\nadorable way and which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a\nstar; and, with her head bathed in light, rosy after a good sleep,\nsubmitting to the gentle glances of the tender old man, she was picking\na daisy to pieces. Cosette did not know the delightful legend, _I love\na little, passionately, etc_.—who was there who could have taught her?\nShe was handling the flower instinctively, innocently, without a\nsuspicion that to pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a heart. If\nthere were a fourth, and smiling Grace called Melancholy, she would\nhave worn the air of that Grace. Jean Valjean was fascinated by the\ncontemplation of those tiny fingers on that flower, and forgetful of\neverything in the radiance emitted by that child. A red-breast was\nwarbling in the thicket, on one side. White cloudlets floated across\nthe sky, so gayly, that one would have said that they had just been set\nat liberty. Cosette went on attentively tearing the leaves from her\nflower; she seemed to be thinking about something; but whatever it was,\nit must be something charming; all at once she turned her head over her\nshoulder with the delicate languor of a swan, and said to Jean Valjean:\n“Father, what are the galleys like?”\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTH—SUCCOR FROM BELOW MAY TURN OUT TO BE SUCCOR FROM ON HIGH\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—A WOUND WITHOUT, HEALING WITHIN\n\n\nThus their life clouded over by degrees.\n\nBut one diversion, which had formerly been a happiness, remained to\nthem, which was to carry bread to those who were hungry, and clothing\nto those who were cold. Cosette often accompanied Jean Valjean on these\nvisits to the poor, on which they recovered some remnants of their\nformer free intercourse; and sometimes, when the day had been a good\none, and they had assisted many in distress, and cheered and warmed\nmany little children, Cosette was rather merry in the evening. It was\nat this epoch that they paid their visit to the Jondrette den.\n\nOn the day following that visit, Jean Valjean made his appearance in\nthe pavilion in the morning, calm as was his wont, but with a large\nwound on his left arm which was much inflamed, and very angry, which\nresembled a burn, and which he explained in some way or other. This\nwound resulted in his being detained in the house for a month with\nfever. He would not call in a doctor. When Cosette urged him, “Call the\ndog-doctor,” said he.\n\nCosette dressed the wound morning and evening with so divine an air and\nsuch angelic happiness at being of use to him, that Jean Valjean felt\nall his former joy returning, his fears and anxieties dissipating, and\nhe gazed at Cosette, saying: “Oh! what a kindly wound! Oh! what a good\nmisfortune!”\n\n\nCosette on perceiving that her father was ill, had deserted the\npavilion and again taken a fancy to the little lodging and the back\ncourtyard. She passed nearly all her days beside Jean Valjean and read\nto him the books which he desired. Generally they were books of travel.\nJean Valjean was undergoing a new birth; his happiness was reviving in\nthese ineffable rays; the Luxembourg, the prowling young stranger,\nCosette’s coldness,—all these clouds upon his soul were growing dim. He\nhad reached the point where he said to himself: “I imagined all that. I\nam an old fool.”\n\n\nHis happiness was so great that the horrible discovery of the\nThénardiers made in the Jondrette hovel, unexpected as it was, had,\nafter a fashion, glided over him unnoticed. He had succeeded in making\nhis escape; all trace of him was lost—what more did he care for! he\nonly thought of those wretched beings to pity them. “Here they are in\nprison, and henceforth they will be incapacitated for doing any harm,”\nhe thought, “but what a lamentable family in distress!”\n\n\nAs for the hideous vision of the Barrière du Maine, Cosette had not\nreferred to it again.\n\nSister Sainte-Mechtilde had taught Cosette music in the convent;\nCosette had the voice of a linnet with a soul, and sometimes, in the\nevening, in the wounded man’s humble abode, she warbled melancholy\nsongs which delighted Jean Valjean.\n\nSpring came; the garden was so delightful at that season of the year,\nthat Jean Valjean said to Cosette:—\n\n“You never go there; I want you to stroll in it.”\n\n\n“As you like, father,” said Cosette.\n\nAnd for the sake of obeying her father, she resumed her walks in the\ngarden, generally alone, for, as we have mentioned, Jean Valjean, who\nwas probably afraid of being seen through the fence, hardly ever went\nthere.\n\nJean Valjean’s wound had created a diversion.\n\nWhen Cosette saw that her father was suffering less, that he was\nconvalescing, and that he appeared to be happy, she experienced a\ncontentment which she did not even perceive, so gently and naturally\nhad it come. Then, it was in the month of March, the days were growing\nlonger, the winter was departing, the winter always bears away with it\na portion of our sadness; then came April, that daybreak of summer,\nfresh as dawn always is, gay like every childhood; a little inclined to\nweep at times like the new-born being that it is. In that month, nature\nhas charming gleams which pass from the sky, from the trees, from the\nmeadows and the flowers into the heart of man.\n\nCosette was still too young to escape the penetrating influence of that\nApril joy which bore so strong a resemblance to herself. Insensibly,\nand without her suspecting the fact, the blackness departed from her\nspirit. In spring, sad souls grow light, as light falls into cellars at\nmidday. Cosette was no longer sad. However, though this was so, she did\nnot account for it to herself. In the morning, about ten o’clock, after\nbreakfast, when she had succeeded in enticing her father into the\ngarden for a quarter of an hour, and when she was pacing up and down in\nthe sunlight in front of the steps, supporting his left arm for him,\nshe did not perceive that she laughed every moment and that she was\nhappy.\n\nJean Valjean, intoxicated, beheld her growing fresh and rosy once more.\n\n“Oh! What a good wound!” he repeated in a whisper.\n\nAnd he felt grateful to the Thénardiers.\n\nHis wound once healed, he resumed his solitary twilight strolls.\n\nIt is a mistake to suppose that a person can stroll alone in that\nfashion in the uninhabited regions of Paris without meeting with some\nadventure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—MOTHER PLUTARQUE FINDS NO DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING A\nPHENOMENON\n\n\nOne evening, little Gavroche had had nothing to eat; he remembered that\nhe had not dined on the preceding day either; this was becoming\ntiresome. He resolved to make an effort to secure some supper. He\nstrolled out beyond the Salpêtrière into deserted regions; that is\nwhere windfalls are to be found; where there is no one, one always\nfinds something. He reached a settlement which appeared to him to be\nthe village of Austerlitz.\n\nIn one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old garden\nhaunted by an old man and an old woman, and in that garden, a passable\napple-tree. Beside the apple-tree stood a sort of fruit-house, which\nwas not securely fastened, and where one might contrive to get an\napple. One apple is a supper; one apple is life. That which was Adam’s\nruin might prove Gavroche’s salvation. The garden abutted on a\nsolitary, unpaved lane, bordered with brushwood while awaiting the\narrival of houses; the garden was separated from it by a hedge.\n\nGavroche directed his steps towards this garden; he found the lane, he\nrecognized the apple-tree, he verified the fruit-house, he examined the\nhedge; a hedge means merely one stride. The day was declining, there\nwas not even a cat in the lane, the hour was propitious. Gavroche began\nthe operation of scaling the hedge, then suddenly paused. Some one was\ntalking in the garden. Gavroche peeped through one of the breaks in the\nhedge.\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nSuccor from Below 4b4-1-succor-from-below\n\n\nA couple of paces distant, at the foot of the hedge on the other side,\nexactly at the point where the gap which he was meditating would have\nbeen made, there was a sort of recumbent stone which formed a bench,\nand on this bench was seated the old man of the garden, while the old\nwoman was standing in front of him. The old woman was grumbling.\nGavroche, who was not very discreet, listened.\n\n“Monsieur Mabeuf!” said the old woman.\n\n“Mabeuf!” thought Gavroche, “that name is a perfect farce.”\n\n\nThe old man who was thus addressed, did not stir. The old woman\nrepeated:—\n\n“Monsieur Mabeuf!”\n\n\nThe old man, without raising his eyes from the ground, made up his mind\nto answer:—\n\n“What is it, Mother Plutarque?”\n\n\n“Mother Plutarque!” thought Gavroche, “another farcical name.”\n\n\nMother Plutarque began again, and the old man was forced to accept the\nconversation:—\n\n“The landlord is not pleased.”\n\n\n“Why?”\n\n\n“We owe three quarters rent.”\n\n\n“In three months, we shall owe him for four quarters.”\n\n\n“He says that he will turn you out to sleep.”\n\n\n“I will go.”\n\n\n“The green-grocer insists on being paid. She will no longer leave her\nfagots. What will you warm yourself with this winter? We shall have no\nwood.”\n\n\n“There is the sun.”\n\n\n“The butcher refuses to give credit; he will not let us have any more\nmeat.”\n\n\n“That is quite right. I do not digest meat well. It is too heavy.”\n\n\n“What shall we have for dinner?”\n\n\n“Bread.”\n\n\n“The baker demands a settlement, and says, ‘no money, no bread.’”\n\n\n“That is well.”\n\n\n“What will you eat?”\n\n\n“We have apples in the apple-room.”\n\n\n“But, Monsieur, we can’t live like that without money.”\n\n\n“I have none.”\n\n\nThe old woman went away, the old man remained alone. He fell into\nthought. Gavroche became thoughtful also. It was almost dark.\n\nThe first result of Gavroche’s meditation was, that instead of scaling\nthe hedge, he crouched down under it. The branches stood apart a little\nat the foot of the thicket.\n\n“Come,” exclaimed Gavroche mentally, “here’s a nook!” and he curled up\nin it. His back was almost in contact with Father Mabeuf’s bench. He\ncould hear the octogenarian breathe.\n\nThen, by way of dinner, he tried to sleep.\n\nIt was a cat-nap, with one eye open. While he dozed, Gavroche kept on\nthe watch.\n\nThe twilight pallor of the sky blanched the earth, and the lane formed\na livid line between two rows of dark bushes.\n\nAll at once, in this whitish band, two figures made their appearance.\nOne was in front, the other some distance in the rear.\n\n“There come two creatures,” muttered Gavroche.\n\nThe first form seemed to be some elderly bourgeois, who was bent and\nthoughtful, dressed more than plainly, and who was walking slowly\nbecause of his age, and strolling about in the open evening air.\n\nThe second was straight, firm, slender. It regulated its pace by that\nof the first; but in the voluntary slowness of its gait, suppleness and\nagility were discernible. This figure had also something fierce and\ndisquieting about it, the whole shape was that of what was then called\n_an elegant_; the hat was of good shape, the coat black, well cut,\nprobably of fine cloth, and well fitted in at the waist. The head was\nheld erect with a sort of robust grace, and beneath the hat the pale\nprofile of a young man could be made out in the dim light. The profile\nhad a rose in its mouth. This second form was well known to Gavroche;\nit was Montparnasse.\n\nHe could have told nothing about the other, except that he was a\nrespectable old man.\n\nGavroche immediately began to take observations.\n\nOne of these two pedestrians evidently had a project connected with the\nother. Gavroche was well placed to watch the course of events. The\nbedroom had turned into a hiding-place at a very opportune moment.\n\nMontparnasse on the hunt at such an hour, in such a place, betokened\nsomething threatening. Gavroche felt his gamin’s heart moved with\ncompassion for the old man.\n\nWhat was he to do? Interfere? One weakness coming to the aid of\nanother! It would be merely a laughing matter for Montparnasse.\nGavroche did not shut his eyes to the fact that the old man, in the\nfirst place, and the child in the second, would make but two mouthfuls\nfor that redoubtable ruffian eighteen years of age.\n\nWhile Gavroche was deliberating, the attack took place, abruptly and\nhideously. The attack of the tiger on the wild ass, the attack of the\nspider on the fly. Montparnasse suddenly tossed away his rose, bounded\nupon the old man, seized him by the collar, grasped and clung to him,\nand Gavroche with difficulty restrained a scream. A moment later one of\nthese men was underneath the other, groaning, struggling, with a knee\nof marble upon his breast. Only, it was not just what Gavroche had\nexpected. The one who lay on the earth was Montparnasse; the one who\nwas on top was the old man. All this took place a few paces distant\nfrom Gavroche.\n\nThe old man had received the shock, had returned it, and that in such a\nterrible fashion, that in a twinkling, the assailant and the assailed\nhad exchanged rôles.\n\n“Here’s a hearty veteran!” thought Gavroche.\n\nHe could not refrain from clapping his hands. But it was applause\nwasted. It did not reach the combatants, absorbed and deafened as they\nwere, each by the other, as their breath mingled in the struggle.\n\nSilence ensued. Montparnasse ceased his struggles. Gavroche indulged in\nthis aside: “Can he be dead!”\n\n\nThe goodman had not uttered a word, nor given vent to a cry. He rose to\nhis feet, and Gavroche heard him say to Montparnasse:—\n\n“Get up.”\n\n\nMontparnasse rose, but the goodman held him fast. Montparnasse’s\nattitude was the humiliated and furious attitude of the wolf who has\nbeen caught by a sheep.\n\nGavroche looked on and listened, making an effort to reinforce his eyes\nwith his ears. He was enjoying himself immensely.\n\nHe was repaid for his conscientious anxiety in the character of a\nspectator. He was able to catch on the wing a dialogue which borrowed\nfrom the darkness an indescribably tragic accent. The goodman\nquestioned, Montparnasse replied.\n\n“How old are you?”\n\n\n“Nineteen.”\n\n\n“You are strong and healthy. Why do you not work?”\n\n\n“It bores me.”\n\n\n“What is your trade?”\n\n\n“An idler.”\n\n\n“Speak seriously. Can anything be done for you? What would you like to\nbe?”\n\n\n“A thief.”\n\n\nA pause ensued. The old man seemed absorbed in profound thought. He\nstood motionless, and did not relax his hold on Montparnasse.\n\nEvery moment the vigorous and agile young ruffian indulged in the\ntwitchings of a wild beast caught in a snare. He gave a jerk, tried a\ncrook of the knee, twisted his limbs desperately, and made efforts to\nescape.\n\nThe old man did not appear to notice it, and held both his arms with\none hand, with the sovereign indifference of absolute force.\n\nThe old man’s reverie lasted for some time, then, looking steadily at\nMontparnasse, he addressed to him in a gentle voice, in the midst of\nthe darkness where they stood, a solemn harangue, of which Gavroche did\nnot lose a single syllable:—\n\n“My child, you are entering, through indolence, on one of the most\nlaborious of lives. Ah! You declare yourself to be an idler! prepare to\ntoil. There is a certain formidable machine, have you seen it? It is\nthe rolling-mill. You must be on your guard against it, it is crafty\nand ferocious; if it catches hold of the skirt of your coat, you will\nbe drawn in bodily. That machine is laziness. Stop while there is yet\ntime, and save yourself! Otherwise, it is all over with you; in a short\ntime you will be among the gearing. Once entangled, hope for nothing\nmore. Toil, lazybones! there is no more repose for you! The iron hand\nof implacable toil has seized you. You do not wish to earn your living,\nto have a task, to fulfil a duty! It bores you to be like other men?\nWell! You will be different. Labor is the law; he who rejects it will\nfind ennui his torment. You do not wish to be a workingman, you will be\na slave. Toil lets go of you on one side only to grasp you again on the\nother. You do not desire to be its friend, you shall be its negro\nslave. Ah! You would have none of the honest weariness of men, you\nshall have the sweat of the damned. Where others sing, you will rattle\nin your throat. You will see afar off, from below, other men at work;\nit will seem to you that they are resting. The laborer, the harvester,\nthe sailor, the blacksmith, will appear to you in glory like the\nblessed spirits in paradise. What radiance surrounds the forge! To\nguide the plough, to bind the sheaves, is joy. The bark at liberty in\nthe wind, what delight! Do you, lazy idler, delve, drag on, roll,\nmarch! Drag your halter. You are a beast of burden in the team of hell!\nAh! To do nothing is your object. Well, not a week, not a day, not an\nhour shall you have free from oppression. You will be able to lift\nnothing without anguish. Every minute that passes will make your\nmuscles crack. What is a feather to others will be a rock to you. The\nsimplest things will become steep acclivities. Life will become\nmonstrous all about you. To go, to come, to breathe, will be just so\nmany terrible labors. Your lungs will produce on you the effect of\nweighing a hundred pounds. Whether you shall walk here rather than\nthere, will become a problem that must be solved. Any one who wants to\ngo out simply gives his door a push, and there he is in the open air.\nIf you wish to go out, you will be obliged to pierce your wall. What\ndoes every one who wants to step into the street do? He goes\ndownstairs; you will tear up your sheets, little by little you will\nmake of them a rope, then you will climb out of your window, and you\nwill suspend yourself by that thread over an abyss, and it will be\nnight, amid storm, rain, and the hurricane, and if the rope is too\nshort, but one way of descending will remain to you, to fall. To drop\nhap-hazard into the gulf, from an unknown height, on what? On what is\nbeneath, on the unknown. Or you will crawl up a chimney-flue, at the\nrisk of burning; or you will creep through a sewer-pipe, at the risk of\ndrowning; I do not speak of the holes that you will be obliged to mask,\nof the stones which you will have to take up and replace twenty times a\nday, of the plaster that you will have to hide in your straw pallet. A\nlock presents itself; the bourgeois has in his pocket a key made by a\nlocksmith. If you wish to pass out, you will be condemned to execute a\nterrible work of art; you will take a large sou, you will cut it in two\nplates; with what tools? You will have to invent them. That is your\nbusiness. Then you will hollow out the interior of these plates, taking\ngreat care of the outside, and you will make on the edges a thread, so\nthat they can be adjusted one upon the other like a box and its cover.\nThe top and bottom thus screwed together, nothing will be suspected. To\nthe overseers it will be only a sou; to you it will be a box. What will\nyou put in this box? A small bit of steel. A watch-spring, in which you\nwill have cut teeth, and which will form a saw. With this saw, as long\nas a pin, and concealed in a sou, you will cut the bolt of the lock,\nyou will sever bolts, the padlock of your chain, and the bar at your\nwindow, and the fetter on your leg. This masterpiece finished, this\nprodigy accomplished, all these miracles of art, address, skill, and\npatience executed, what will be your recompense if it becomes known\nthat you are the author? The dungeon. There is your future. What\nprecipices are idleness and pleasure! Do you know that to do nothing is\na melancholy resolution? To live in idleness on the property of\nsociety! to be useless, that is to say, pernicious! This leads straight\nto the depth of wretchedness. Woe to the man who desires to be a\nparasite! He will become vermin! Ah! So it does not please you to work?\nAh! You have but one thought, to drink well, to eat well, to sleep\nwell. You will drink water, you will eat black bread, you will sleep on\na plank with a fetter whose cold touch you will feel on your flesh all\nnight long, riveted to your limbs. You will break those fetters, you\nwill flee. That is well. You will crawl on your belly through the\nbrushwood, and you will eat grass like the beasts of the forest. And\nyou will be recaptured. And then you will pass years in a dungeon,\nriveted to a wall, groping for your jug that you may drink, gnawing at\na horrible loaf of darkness which dogs would not touch, eating beans\nthat the worms have eaten before you. You will be a wood-louse in a\ncellar. Ah! Have pity on yourself, you miserable young child, who were\nsucking at nurse less than twenty years ago, and who have, no doubt, a\nmother still alive! I conjure you, listen to me, I entreat you. You\ndesire fine black cloth, varnished shoes, to have your hair curled and\nsweet-smelling oils on your locks, to please low women, to be handsome.\nYou will be shaven clean, and you will wear a red blouse and wooden\nshoes. You want rings on your fingers, you will have an iron necklet on\nyour neck. If you glance at a woman, you will receive a blow. And you\nwill enter there at the age of twenty. And you will come out at fifty!\nYou will enter young, rosy, fresh, with brilliant eyes, and all your\nwhite teeth, and your handsome, youthful hair; you will come out\nbroken, bent, wrinkled, toothless, horrible, with white locks! Ah! my\npoor child, you are on the wrong road; idleness is counselling you\nbadly; the hardest of all work is thieving. Believe me, do not\nundertake that painful profession of an idle man. It is not comfortable\nto become a rascal. It is less disagreeable to be an honest man. Now\ngo, and ponder on what I have said to you. By the way, what did you\nwant of me? My purse? Here it is.”\n\n\nAnd the old man, releasing Montparnasse, put his purse in the latter’s\nhand; Montparnasse weighed it for a moment, after which he allowed it\nto slide gently into the back pocket of his coat, with the same\nmechanical precaution as though he had stolen it.\n\nAll this having been said and done, the goodman turned his back and\ntranquilly resumed his stroll.\n\n“The blockhead!” muttered Montparnasse.\n\nWho was this goodman? The reader has, no doubt, already divined.\n\nMontparnasse watched him with amazement, as he disappeared in the dusk.\nThis contemplation was fatal to him.\n\nWhile the old man was walking away, Gavroche drew near.\n\nGavroche had assured himself, with a sidelong glance, that Father\nMabeuf was still sitting on his bench, probably sound asleep. Then the\ngamin emerged from his thicket, and began to crawl after Montparnasse\nin the dark, as the latter stood there motionless. In this manner he\ncame up to Montparnasse without being seen or heard, gently insinuated\nhis hand into the back pocket of that frock-coat of fine black cloth,\nseized the purse, withdrew his hand, and having recourse once more to\nhis crawling, he slipped away like an adder through the shadows.\nMontparnasse, who had no reason to be on his guard, and who was engaged\nin thought for the first time in his life, perceived nothing. When\nGavroche had once more attained the point where Father Mabeuf was, he\nflung the purse over the hedge, and fled as fast as his legs would\ncarry him.\n\nThe purse fell on Father Mabeuf’s foot. This commotion roused him.\n\nHe bent over and picked up the purse.\n\nHe did not understand in the least, and opened it.\n\nThe purse had two compartments; in one of them there was some small\nchange; in the other lay six napoleons.\n\nM. Mabeuf, in great alarm, referred the matter to his housekeeper.\n\n“That has fallen from heaven,” said Mother Plutarque.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTH—THE END OF WHICH DOES NOT RESEMBLE THE BEGINNING\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—SOLITUDE AND THE BARRACKS COMBINED\n\n\nCosette’s grief, which had been so poignant and lively four or five\nmonths previously, had, without her being conscious of the fact,\nentered upon its convalescence. Nature, spring, youth, love for her\nfather, the gayety of the birds and flowers, caused something almost\nresembling forgetfulness to filter gradually, drop by drop, into that\nsoul, which was so virgin and so young. Was the fire wholly extinct\nthere? Or was it merely that layers of ashes had formed? The truth is,\nthat she hardly felt the painful and burning spot any longer.\n\nOne day she suddenly thought of Marius: “Why!” said she, “I no longer\nthink of him.”\n\n\nThat same week, she noticed a very handsome officer of lancers, with a\nwasp-like waist, a delicious uniform, the cheeks of a young girl, a\nsword under his arm, waxed moustaches, and a glazed schapka, passing\nthe gate. Moreover, he had light hair, prominent blue eyes, a round\nface, was vain, insolent and good-looking; quite the reverse of Marius.\nHe had a cigar in his mouth. Cosette thought that this officer\ndoubtless belonged to the regiment in barracks in the Rue de Babylone.\n\nOn the following day, she saw him pass again. She took note of the\nhour.\n\nFrom that time forth, was it chance? she saw him pass nearly every day.\n\nThe officer’s comrades perceived that there was, in that “badly kept”\ngarden, behind that malicious rococo fence, a very pretty creature, who\nwas almost always there when the handsome lieutenant,—who is not\nunknown to the reader, and whose name was Théodule Gillenormand,—passed\nby.\n\n“See here!” they said to him, “there’s a little creature there who is\nmaking eyes at you, look.”\n\n\n“Have I the time,” replied the lancer, “to look at all the girls who\nlook at me?”\n\n\nThis was at the precise moment when Marius was descending heavily\ntowards agony, and was saying: “If I could but see her before I\ndie!”—Had his wish been realized, had he beheld Cosette at that moment\ngazing at the lancer, he would not have been able to utter a word, and\nhe would have expired with grief.\n\nWhose fault was it? No one’s.\n\nMarius possessed one of those temperaments which bury themselves in\nsorrow and there abide; Cosette was one of those persons who plunge\ninto sorrow and emerge from it again.\n\nCosette was, moreover, passing through that dangerous period, the fatal\nphase of feminine reverie abandoned to itself, in which the isolated\nheart of a young girl resembles the tendrils of the vine which cling,\nas chance directs, to the capital of a marble column or to the post of\na wine-shop: A rapid and decisive moment, critical for every orphan, be\nshe rich or poor, for wealth does not prevent a bad choice;\nmisalliances are made in very high circles, real misalliance is that of\nsouls; and as many an unknown young man, without name, without birth,\nwithout fortune, is a marble column which bears up a temple of grand\nsentiments and grand ideas, so such and such a man of the world\nsatisfied and opulent, who has polished boots and varnished words, if\nlooked at not outside, but inside, a thing which is reserved for his\nwife, is nothing more than a block obscurely haunted by violent,\nunclean, and vinous passions; the post of a drinking-shop.\n\nWhat did Cosette’s soul contain? Passion calmed or lulled to sleep;\nsomething limpid, brilliant, troubled to a certain depth, and gloomy\nlower down. The image of the handsome officer was reflected in the\nsurface. Did a souvenir linger in the depths?—Quite at the\nbottom?—Possibly. Cosette did not know.\n\nA singular incident supervened.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—COSETTE’S APPREHENSIONS\n\n\nDuring the first fortnight in April, Jean Valjean took a journey. This,\nas the reader knows, happened from time to time, at very long\nintervals. He remained absent a day or two days at the utmost. Where\ndid he go? No one knew, not even Cosette. Once only, on the occasion of\none of these departures, she had accompanied him in a hackney-coach as\nfar as a little blind-alley at the corner of which she read: _Impasse\nde la Planchette_. There he alighted, and the coach took Cosette back\nto the Rue de Babylone. It was usually when money was lacking in the\nhouse that Jean Valjean took these little trips.\n\nSo Jean Valjean was absent. He had said: “I shall return in three\ndays.”\n\n\nThat evening, Cosette was alone in the drawing-room. In order to get\nrid of her ennui, she had opened her piano-organ, and had begun to\nsing, accompanying herself the while, the chorus from _Euryanthe_:\n“Hunters astray in the wood!” which is probably the most beautiful\nthing in all the sphere of music. When she had finished, she remained\nwrapped in thought.\n\nAll at once, it seemed to her that she heard the sound of footsteps in\nthe garden.\n\nIt could not be her father, he was absent; it could not be Toussaint,\nshe was in bed, and it was ten o’clock at night.\n\nShe stepped to the shutter of the drawing-room, which was closed, and\nlaid her ear against it.\n\nIt seemed to her that it was the tread of a man, and that he was\nwalking very softly.\n\nShe mounted rapidly to the first floor, to her own chamber, opened a\nsmall wicket in her shutter, and peeped into the garden. The moon was\nat the full. Everything could be seen as plainly as by day.\n\nThere was no one there.\n\nShe opened the window. The garden was absolutely calm, and all that was\nvisible was that the street was deserted as usual.\n\nCosette thought that she had been mistaken. She thought that she had\nheard a noise. It was a hallucination produced by the melancholy and\nmagnificent chorus of Weber, which lays open before the mind terrified\ndepths, which trembles before the gaze like a dizzy forest, and in\nwhich one hears the crackling of dead branches beneath the uneasy tread\nof the huntsmen of whom one catches a glimpse through the twilight.\n\nShe thought no more about it.\n\nMoreover, Cosette was not very timid by nature. There flowed in her\nveins some of the blood of the bohemian and the adventuress who runs\nbarefoot. It will be remembered that she was more of a lark than a\ndove. There was a foundation of wildness and bravery in her.\n\nOn the following day, at an earlier hour, towards nightfall, she was\nstrolling in the garden. In the midst of the confused thoughts which\noccupied her, she fancied that she caught for an instant a sound\nsimilar to that of the preceding evening, as though some one were\nwalking beneath the trees in the dusk, and not very far from her; but\nshe told herself that nothing so closely resembles a step on the grass\nas the friction of two branches which have moved from side to side, and\nshe paid no heed to it. Besides, she could see nothing.\n\nShe emerged from “the thicket”; she had still to cross a small lawn to\nregain the steps.\n\nThe moon, which had just risen behind her, cast Cosette’s shadow in\nfront of her upon this lawn, as she came out from the shrubbery.\n\nCosette halted in alarm.\n\nBeside her shadow, the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf another\nshadow, which was particularly startling and terrible, a shadow which\nhad a round hat.\n\nIt was the shadow of a man, who must have been standing on the border\nof the clump of shrubbery, a few paces in the rear of Cosette.\n\nShe stood for a moment without the power to speak, or cry, or call, or\nstir, or turn her head.\n\nThen she summoned up all her courage, and turned round resolutely.\n\nThere was no one there.\n\nShe glanced on the ground. The figure had disappeared.\n\nShe re-entered the thicket, searched the corners boldly, went as far as\nthe gate, and found nothing.\n\nShe felt herself absolutely chilled with terror. Was this another\nhallucination? What! Two days in succession! One hallucination might\npass, but two hallucinations? The disquieting point about it was, that\nthe shadow had assuredly not been a phantom. Phantoms do not wear round\nhats.\n\nOn the following day Jean Valjean returned. Cosette told him what she\nthought she had heard and seen. She wanted to be reassured and to see\nher father shrug his shoulders and say to her: “You are a little\ngoose.”\n\n\nJean Valjean grew anxious.\n\n“It cannot be anything,” said he.\n\nHe left her under some pretext, and went into the garden, and she saw\nhim examining the gate with great attention.\n\nDuring the night she woke up; this time she was sure, and she\ndistinctly heard some one walking close to the flight of steps beneath\nher window. She ran to her little wicket and opened it. In point of\nfact, there was a man in the garden, with a large club in his hand.\nJust as she was about to scream, the moon lighted up the man’s profile.\nIt was her father. She returned to her bed, saying to herself: “He is\nvery uneasy!”\n\n\nJean Valjean passed that night and the two succeeding nights in the\ngarden. Cosette saw him through the hole in her shutter.\n\nOn the third night, the moon was on the wane, and had begun to rise\nlater; at one o’clock in the morning, possibly, she heard a loud burst\nof laughter and her father’s voice calling her:—\n\n“Cosette!”\n\n\nShe jumped out of bed, threw on her dressing-gown, and opened her\nwindow.\n\nHer father was standing on the grass-plot below.\n\n“I have waked you for the purpose of reassuring you,” said he; “look,\nthere is your shadow with the round hat.”\n\n\nAnd he pointed out to her on the turf a shadow cast by the moon, and\nwhich did indeed, bear considerable resemblance to the spectre of a man\nwearing a round hat. It was the shadow produced by a chimney-pipe of\nsheet iron, with a hood, which rose above a neighboring roof.\n\nCosette joined in his laughter, all her lugubrious suppositions were\nallayed, and the next morning, as she was at breakfast with her father,\nshe made merry over the sinister garden haunted by the shadows of iron\nchimney-pots.\n\nJean Valjean became quite tranquil once more; as for Cosette, she did\nnot pay much attention to the question whether the chimney-pot was\nreally in the direction of the shadow which she had seen, or thought\nshe had seen, and whether the moon had been in the same spot in the\nsky.\n\nShe did not question herself as to the peculiarity of a chimney-pot\nwhich is afraid of being caught in the act, and which retires when some\none looks at its shadow, for the shadow had taken the alarm when\nCosette had turned round, and Cosette had thought herself very sure of\nthis. Cosette’s serenity was fully restored. The proof appeared to her\nto be complete, and it quite vanished from her mind, whether there\ncould possibly be any one walking in the garden during the evening or\nat night.\n\nA few days later, however, a fresh incident occurred.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—ENRICHED WITH COMMENTARIES BY TOUSSAINT\n\n\nIn the garden, near the railing on the street, there was a stone bench,\nscreened from the eyes of the curious by a plantation of yoke-elms, but\nwhich could, in case of necessity, be reached by an arm from the\noutside, past the trees and the gate.\n\nOne evening during that same month of April, Jean Valjean had gone out;\nCosette had seated herself on this bench after sundown. The breeze was\nblowing briskly in the trees, Cosette was meditating; an objectless\nsadness was taking possession of her little by little, that invincible\nsadness evoked by the evening, and which arises, perhaps, who knows,\nfrom the mystery of the tomb which is ajar at that hour.\n\nPerhaps Fantine was within that shadow.\n\nCosette rose, slowly made the tour of the garden, walking on the grass\ndrenched in dew, and saying to herself, through the species of\nmelancholy somnambulism in which she was plunged: “Really, one needs\nwooden shoes for the garden at this hour. One takes cold.”\n\n\nShe returned to the bench.\n\nAs she was about to resume her seat there, she observed on the spot\nwhich she had quitted, a tolerably large stone which had, evidently,\nnot been there a moment before.\n\nCosette gazed at the stone, asking herself what it meant. All at once\nthe idea occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench all\nby itself, that some one had placed it there, that an arm had been\nthrust through the railing, and this idea appeared to alarm her. This\ntime, the fear was genuine; the stone was there. No doubt was possible;\nshe did not touch it, fled without glancing behind her, took refuge in\nthe house, and immediately closed with shutter, bolt, and bar the\ndoor-like window opening on the flight of steps. She inquired of\nToussaint:—\n\n“Has my father returned yet?”\n\n\n“Not yet, Mademoiselle.”\n\n\n[We have already noted once for all the fact that Toussaint stuttered.\nMay we be permitted to dispense with it for the future. The musical\nnotation of an infirmity is repugnant to us.]\n\nJean Valjean, a thoughtful man, and given to nocturnal strolls, often\nreturned quite late at night.\n\n“Toussaint,” went on Cosette, “are you careful to thoroughly barricade\nthe shutters opening on the garden, at least with bars, in the evening,\nand to put the little iron things in the little rings that close them?”\n\n\n“Oh! be easy on that score, Miss.”\n\n\nToussaint did not fail in her duty, and Cosette was well aware of the\nfact, but she could not refrain from adding:—\n\n“It is so solitary here.”\n\n\n“So far as that is concerned,” said Toussaint, “it is true. We might be\nassassinated before we had time to say _ouf!_ And Monsieur does not\nsleep in the house, to boot. But fear nothing, Miss, I fasten the\nshutters up like prisons. Lone women! That is enough to make one\nshudder, I believe you! Just imagine, what if you were to see men enter\nyour chamber at night and say: ‘Hold your tongue!’ and begin to cut\nyour throat. It’s not the dying so much; you die, for one must die, and\nthat’s all right; it’s the abomination of feeling those people touch\nyou. And then, their knives; they can’t be able to cut well with them!\nAh, good gracious!”\n\n\n“Be quiet,” said Cosette. “Fasten everything thoroughly.”\n\n\nCosette, terrified by the melodrama improvised by Toussaint, and\npossibly, also, by the recollection of the apparitions of the past\nweek, which recurred to her memory, dared not even say to her: “Go and\nlook at the stone which has been placed on the bench!” for fear of\nopening the garden gate and allowing “the men” to enter. She saw that\nall the doors and windows were carefully fastened, made Toussaint go\nall over the house from garret to cellar, locked herself up in her own\nchamber, bolted her door, looked under her couch, went to bed and slept\nbadly. All night long she saw that big stone, as large as a mountain\nand full of caverns.\n\nAt sunrise,—the property of the rising sun is to make us laugh at all\nour terrors of the past night, and our laughter is in direct proportion\nto our terror which they have caused,—at sunrise Cosette, when she\nwoke, viewed her fright as a nightmare, and said to herself: “What have\nI been thinking of? It is like the footsteps that I thought I heard a\nweek or two ago in the garden at night! It is like the shadow of the\nchimney-pot! Am I becoming a coward?” The sun, which was glowing\nthrough the crevices in her shutters, and turning the damask curtains\ncrimson, reassured her to such an extent that everything vanished from\nher thoughts, even the stone.\n\n“There was no more a stone on the bench than there was a man in a round\nhat in the garden; I dreamed about the stone, as I did all the rest.”\n\n\nShe dressed herself, descended to the garden, ran to the bench, and\nbroke out in a cold perspiration. The stone was there.\n\nBut this lasted only for a moment. That which is terror by night is\ncuriosity by day.\n\n“Bah!” said she, “come, let us see what it is.”\n\n\nShe lifted the stone, which was tolerably large. Beneath it was\nsomething which resembled a letter. It was a white envelope. Cosette\nseized it. There was no address on one side, no seal on the other. Yet\nthe envelope, though unsealed, was not empty. Papers could be seen\ninside.\n\nCosette examined it. It was no longer alarm, it was no longer\ncuriosity; it was a beginning of anxiety.\n\nCosette drew from the envelope its contents, a little notebook of\npaper, each page of which was numbered and bore a few lines in a very\nfine and rather pretty handwriting, as Cosette thought.\n\nCosette looked for a name; there was none. To whom was this addressed?\nTo her, probably, since a hand had deposited the packet on her bench.\nFrom whom did it come? An irresistible fascination took possession of\nher; she tried to turn away her eyes from the leaflets which were\ntrembling in her hand, she gazed at the sky, the street, the acacias\nall bathed in light, the pigeons fluttering over a neighboring roof,\nand then her glance suddenly fell upon the manuscript, and she said to\nherself that she must know what it contained.\n\nThis is what she read.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—A HEART BENEATH A STONE\n\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nCosette With Letter  4b4-5-cosette-after-letter\n\n\nThe reduction of the universe to a single being, the expansion of a\nsingle being even to God, that is love.\n\nLove is the salutation of the angels to the stars.\n\nHow sad is the soul, when it is sad through love!\n\nWhat a void in the absence of the being who, by herself alone fills the\nworld! Oh! how true it is that the beloved being becomes God. One could\ncomprehend that God might be jealous of this had not God the Father of\nall evidently made creation for the soul, and the soul for love.\n\nThe glimpse of a smile beneath a white crape bonnet with a lilac\ncurtain is sufficient to cause the soul to enter into the palace of\ndreams.\n\nGod is behind everything, but everything hides God. Things are black,\ncreatures are opaque. To love a being is to render that being\ntransparent.\n\nCertain thoughts are prayers. There are moments when, whatever the\nattitude of the body may be, the soul is on its knees.\n\nParted lovers beguile absence by a thousand chimerical devices, which\npossess, however, a reality of their own. They are prevented from\nseeing each other, they cannot write to each other; they discover a\nmultitude of mysterious means to correspond. They send each other the\nsong of the birds, the perfume of the flowers, the smiles of children,\nthe light of the sun, the sighings of the breeze, the rays of stars,\nall creation. And why not? All the works of God are made to serve love.\nLove is sufficiently potent to charge all nature with its messages.\n\nOh Spring! Thou art a letter that I write to her.\n\nThe future belongs to hearts even more than it does to minds. Love,\nthat is the only thing that can occupy and fill eternity. In the\ninfinite, the inexhaustible is requisite.\n\nLove participates of the soul itself. It is of the same nature. Like\nit, it is the divine spark; like it, it is incorruptible, indivisible,\nimperishable. It is a point of fire that exists within us, which is\nimmortal and infinite, which nothing can confine, and which nothing can\nextinguish. We feel it burning even to the very marrow of our bones,\nand we see it beaming in the very depths of heaven.\n\nOh Love! Adorations! voluptuousness of two minds which understand each\nother, of two hearts which exchange with each other, of two glances\nwhich penetrate each other! You will come to me, will you not, bliss!\nstrolls by twos in the solitudes! Blessed and radiant days! I have\nsometimes dreamed that from time to time hours detached themselves from\nthe lives of the angels and came here below to traverse the destinies\nof men.\n\nGod can add nothing to the happiness of those who love, except to give\nthem endless duration. After a life of love, an eternity of love is, in\nfact, an augmentation; but to increase in intensity even the ineffable\nfelicity which love bestows on the soul even in this world, is\nimpossible, even to God. God is the plenitude of heaven; love is the\nplenitude of man.\n\nYou look at a star for two reasons, because it is luminous, and because\nit is impenetrable. You have beside you a sweeter radiance and a\ngreater mystery, woman.\n\nAll of us, whoever we may be, have our respirable beings. We lack air\nand we stifle. Then we die. To die for lack of love is horrible.\nSuffocation of the soul.\n\nWhen love has fused and mingled two beings in a sacred and angelic\nunity, the secret of life has been discovered so far as they are\nconcerned; they are no longer anything more than the two boundaries of\nthe same destiny; they are no longer anything but the two wings of the\nsame spirit. Love, soar.\n\nOn the day when a woman as she passes before you emits light as she\nwalks, you are lost, you love. But one thing remains for you to do: to\nthink of her so intently that she is constrained to think of you.\n\nWhat love commences can be finished by God alone.\n\nTrue love is in despair and is enchanted over a glove lost or a\nhandkerchief found, and eternity is required for its devotion and its\nhopes. It is composed both of the infinitely great and the infinitely\nlittle.\n\nIf you are a stone, be adamant; if you are a plant, be the sensitive\nplant; if you are a man, be love.\n\nNothing suffices for love. We have happiness, we desire paradise; we\npossess paradise, we desire heaven.\n\nOh ye who love each other, all this is contained in love. Understand\nhow to find it there. Love has contemplation as well as heaven, and\nmore than heaven, it has voluptuousness.\n\n“Does she still come to the Luxembourg?” “No, sir.” “This is the church\nwhere she attends mass, is it not?” “She no longer comes here.” “Does\nshe still live in this house?” “She has moved away.” “Where has she\ngone to dwell?”\n\n\n“She did not say.”\n\n\nWhat a melancholy thing not to know the address of one’s soul!\n\nLove has its childishness, other passions have their pettinesses. Shame\non the passions which belittle man! Honor to the one which makes a\nchild of him!\n\nThere is one strange thing, do you know it? I dwell in the night. There\nis a being who carried off my sky when she went away.\n\nOh! would that we were lying side by side in the same grave, hand in\nhand, and from time to time, in the darkness, gently caressing a\nfinger,—that would suffice for my eternity!\n\nYe who suffer because ye love, love yet more. To die of love, is to\nlive in it.\n\nLove. A sombre and starry transfiguration is mingled with this torture.\nThere is ecstasy in agony.\n\nOh joy of the birds! It is because they have nests that they sing.\n\nLove is a celestial respiration of the air of paradise.\n\nDeep hearts, sage minds, take life as God has made it; it is a long\ntrial, an incomprehensible preparation for an unknown destiny. This\ndestiny, the true one, begins for a man with the first step inside the\ntomb. Then something appears to him, and he begins to distinguish the\ndefinitive. The definitive, meditate upon that word. The living\nperceive the infinite; the definitive permits itself to be seen only by\nthe dead. In the meanwhile, love and suffer, hope and contemplate. Woe,\nalas! to him who shall have loved only bodies, forms, appearances!\nDeath will deprive him of all. Try to love souls, you will find them\nagain.\n\nI encountered in the street, a very poor young man who was in love. His\nhat was old, his coat was worn, his elbows were in holes; water\ntrickled through his shoes, and the stars through his soul.\n\nWhat a grand thing it is to be loved! What a far grander thing it is to\nlove! The heart becomes heroic, by dint of passion. It is no longer\ncomposed of anything but what is pure; it no longer rests on anything\nthat is not elevated and great. An unworthy thought can no more\ngerminate in it, than a nettle on a glacier. The serene and lofty soul,\ninaccessible to vulgar passions and emotions, dominating the clouds and\nthe shades of this world, its follies, its lies, its hatreds, its\nvanities, its miseries, inhabits the blue of heaven, and no longer\nfeels anything but profound and subterranean shocks of destiny, as the\ncrests of mountains feel the shocks of earthquake.\n\nIf there did not exist some one who loved, the sun would become\nextinct.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—COSETTE AFTER THE LETTER\n\n\nAs Cosette read, she gradually fell into thought. At the very moment\nwhen she raised her eyes from the last line of the note-book, the\nhandsome officer passed triumphantly in front of the gate,—it was his\nhour; Cosette thought him hideous.\n\nShe resumed her contemplation of the book. It was written in the most\ncharming of chirography, thought Cosette; in the same hand, but with\ndivers inks, sometimes very black, again whitish, as when ink has been\nadded to the inkstand, and consequently on different days. It was,\nthen, a mind which had unfolded itself there, sigh by sigh,\nirregularly, without order, without choice, without object, hap-hazard.\nCosette had never read anything like it. This manuscript, in which she\nalready perceived more light than obscurity, produced upon her the\neffect of a half-open sanctuary. Each one of these mysterious lines\nshone before her eyes and inundated her heart with a strange radiance.\nThe education which she had received had always talked to her of the\nsoul, and never of love, very much as one might talk of the firebrand\nand not of the flame. This manuscript of fifteen pages suddenly and\nsweetly revealed to her all of love, sorrow, destiny, life, eternity,\nthe beginning, the end. It was as if a hand had opened and suddenly\nflung upon her a handful of rays of light. In these few lines she felt\na passionate, ardent, generous, honest nature, a sacred will, an\nimmense sorrow, and an immense despair, a suffering heart, an ecstasy\nfully expanded. What was this manuscript? A letter. A letter without\nname, without address, without date, without signature, pressing and\ndisinterested, an enigma composed of truths, a message of love made to\nbe brought by an angel and read by a virgin, an appointment made beyond\nthe bounds of earth, the love-letter of a phantom to a shade. It was an\nabsent one, tranquil and dejected, who seemed ready to take refuge in\ndeath and who sent to the absent love, his lady, the secret of fate,\nthe key of life, love. This had been written with one foot in the grave\nand one finger in heaven. These lines, which had fallen one by one on\nthe paper, were what might be called drops of soul.\n\nNow, from whom could these pages come? Who could have penned them?\n\nCosette did not hesitate a moment. One man only.\n\nHe!\n\nDay had dawned once more in her spirit; all had reappeared. She felt an\nunheard-of joy, and a profound anguish. It was he! he who had written!\nhe was there! it was he whose arm had been thrust through that railing!\nWhile she was forgetful of him, he had found her again! But had she\nforgotten him? No, never! She was foolish to have thought so for a\nsingle moment. She had always loved him, always adored him. The fire\nhad been smothered, and had smouldered for a time, but she saw all\nplainly now; it had but made headway, and now it had burst forth\nafresh, and had inflamed her whole being. This note-book was like a\nspark which had fallen from that other soul into hers. She felt the\nconflagration starting up once more.\n\nShe imbued herself thoroughly with every word of the manuscript: “Oh\nyes!” said she, “how perfectly I recognize all that! That is what I had\nalready read in his eyes.” As she was finishing it for the third time,\nLieutenant Théodule passed the gate once more, and rattled his spurs\nupon the pavement. Cosette was forced to raise her eyes. She thought\nhim insipid, silly, stupid, useless, foppish, displeasing, impertinent,\nand extremely ugly. The officer thought it his duty to smile at her.\n\nShe turned away as in shame and indignation. She would gladly have\nthrown something at his head.\n\nShe fled, re-entered the house, and shut herself up in her chamber to\nperuse the manuscript once more, to learn it by heart, and to dream.\nWhen she had thoroughly mastered it she kissed it and put it in her\nbosom.\n\nAll was over, Cosette had fallen back into deep, seraphic love. The\nabyss of Eden had yawned once more.\n\nAll day long, Cosette remained in a sort of bewilderment. She scarcely\nthought, her ideas were in the state of a tangled skein in her brain,\nshe could not manage to conjecture anything, she hoped through a\ntremor, what? vague things. She dared make herself no promises, and she\ndid not wish to refuse herself anything. Flashes of pallor passed over\nher countenance, and shivers ran through her frame. It seemed to her,\nat intervals, that she was entering the land of chimæras; she said to\nherself: “Is this reality?” Then she felt of the dear paper within her\nbosom under her gown, she pressed it to her heart, she felt its angles\nagainst her flesh; and if Jean Valjean had seen her at the moment, he\nwould have shuddered in the presence of that luminous and unknown joy,\nwhich overflowed from beneath her eyelids.—“Oh yes!” she thought, “it\nis certainly he! This comes from him, and is for me!”\n\n\nAnd she told herself that an intervention of the angels, a celestial\nchance, had given him back to her.\n\nOh transfiguration of love! Oh dreams! That celestial chance, that\nintervention of the angels, was a pellet of bread tossed by one thief\nto another thief, from the Charlemagne Courtyard to the Lion’s Ditch,\nover the roofs of La Force.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—OLD PEOPLE ARE MADE TO GO OUT OPPORTUNELY\n\n\nWhen evening came, Jean Valjean went out; Cosette dressed herself. She\narranged her hair in the most becoming manner, and she put on a dress\nwhose bodice had received one snip of the scissors too much, and which,\nthrough this slope, permitted a view of the beginning of her throat,\nand was, as young girls say, “a trifle indecent.” It was not in the\nleast indecent, but it was prettier than usual. She made her toilet\nthus without knowing why she did so.\n\nDid she mean to go out? No.\n\nWas she expecting a visitor? No.\n\nAt dusk, she went down to the garden. Toussaint was busy in her\nkitchen, which opened on the back yard.\n\nShe began to stroll about under the trees, thrusting aside the branches\nfrom time to time with her hand, because there were some which hung\nvery low.\n\nIn this manner she reached the bench.\n\nThe stone was still there.\n\nShe sat down, and gently laid her white hand on this stone as though\nshe wished to caress and thank it.\n\nAll at once, she experienced that indefinable impression which one\nundergoes when there is some one standing behind one, even when she\ndoes not see the person.\n\nShe turned her head and rose to her feet.\n\nIt was he.\n\nHis head was bare. He appeared to have grown thin and pale. His black\nclothes were hardly discernible. The twilight threw a wan light on his\nfine brow, and covered his eyes in shadows. Beneath a veil of\nincomparable sweetness, he had something about him that suggested death\nand night. His face was illuminated by the light of the dying day, and\nby the thought of a soul that is taking flight.\n\nHe seemed to be not yet a ghost, and he was no longer a man.\n\nHe had flung away his hat in the thicket, a few paces distant.\n\nCosette, though ready to swoon, uttered no cry. She retreated slowly,\nfor she felt herself attracted. He did not stir. By virtue of something\nineffable and melancholy which enveloped him, she felt the look in his\neyes which she could not see.\n\nCosette, in her retreat, encountered a tree and leaned against it. Had\nit not been for this tree, she would have fallen.\n\nThen she heard his voice, that voice which she had really never heard,\nbarely rising above the rustle of the leaves, and murmuring:—\n\n“Pardon me, here I am. My heart is full. I could not live on as I was\nliving, and I have come. Have you read what I placed there on the\nbench? Do you recognize me at all? Have no fear of me. It is a long\ntime, you remember the day, since you looked at me at the Luxembourg,\nnear the Gladiator. And the day when you passed before me? It was on\nthe 16th of June and the 2d of July. It is nearly a year ago. I have\nnot seen you for a long time. I inquired of the woman who let the\nchairs, and she told me that she no longer saw you. You lived in the\nRue de l’Ouest, on the third floor, in the front apartments of a new\nhouse,—you see that I know! I followed you. What else was there for me\nto do? And then you disappeared. I thought I saw you pass once, while I\nwas reading the newspapers under the arcade of the Odéon. I ran after\nyou. But no. It was a person who had a bonnet like yours. At night I\ncame hither. Do not be afraid, no one sees me. I come to gaze upon your\nwindows near at hand. I walk very softly, so that you may not hear, for\nyou might be alarmed. The other evening I was behind you, you turned\nround, I fled. Once, I heard you singing. I was happy. Did it affect\nyou because I heard you singing through the shutters? That could not\nhurt you. No, it is not so? You see, you are my angel! Let me come\nsometimes; I think that I am going to die. If you only knew! I adore\nyou. Forgive me, I speak to you, but I do not know what I am saying; I\nmay have displeased you; have I displeased you?”\n\n\n“Oh! my mother!” said she.\n\nAnd she sank down as though on the point of death.\n\nHe grasped her, she fell, he took her in his arms, he pressed her\nclose, without knowing what he was doing. He supported her, though he\nwas tottering himself. It was as though his brain were full of smoke;\nlightnings darted between his lips; his ideas vanished; it seemed to\nhim that he was accomplishing some religious act, and that he was\ncommitting a profanation. Moreover, he had not the least passion for\nthis lovely woman whose force he felt against his breast. He was beside\nhimself with love.\n\nShe took his hand and laid it on her heart. He felt the paper there, he\nstammered:—\n\n“You love me, then?”\n\n\nShe replied in a voice so low that it was no longer anything more than\na barely audible breath:—\n\n“Hush! Thou knowest it!”\n\n\nAnd she hid her blushing face on the breast of the superb and\nintoxicated young man.\n\nHe fell upon the bench, and she beside him. They had no words more. The\nstars were beginning to gleam. How did it come to pass that their lips\nmet? How comes it to pass that the birds sing, that snow melts, that\nthe rose unfolds, that May expands, that the dawn grows white behind\nthe black trees on the shivering crest of the hills?\n\nA kiss, and that was all.\n\nBoth started, and gazed into the darkness with sparkling eyes.\n\nThey felt neither the cool night, nor the cold stone, nor the damp\nearth, nor the wet grass; they looked at each other, and their hearts\nwere full of thoughts. They had clasped hands unconsciously.\n\nShe did not ask him, she did not even wonder, how he had entered there,\nand how he had made his way into the garden. It seemed so simple to her\nthat he should be there!\n\nFrom time to time, Marius’ knee touched Cosette’s knee, and both\nshivered.\n\nAt intervals, Cosette stammered a word. Her soul fluttered on her lips\nlike a drop of dew on a flower.\n\nLittle by little they began to talk to each other. Effusion followed\nsilence, which is fulness. The night was serene and splendid overhead.\nThese two beings, pure as spirits, told each other everything, their\ndreams, their intoxications, their ecstasies, their chimæras, their\nweaknesses, how they had adored each other from afar, how they had\nlonged for each other, their despair when they had ceased to see each\nother. They confided to each other in an ideal intimacy, which nothing\ncould augment, their most secret and most mysterious thoughts. They\nrelated to each other, with candid faith in their illusions, all that\nlove, youth, and the remains of childhood which still lingered about\nthem, suggested to their minds. Their two hearts poured themselves out\ninto each other in such wise, that at the expiration of a quarter of an\nhour, it was the young man who had the young girl’s soul, and the young\ngirl who had the young man’s soul. Each became permeated with the\nother, they were enchanted with each other, they dazzled each other.\n\nWhen they had finished, when they had told each other everything, she\nlaid her head on his shoulder and asked him:—\n\n“What is your name?”\n\n\n“My name is Marius,” said he. “And yours?”\n\n\n“My name is Cosette.”\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SIXTH—LITTLE GAVROCHE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE MALICIOUS PLAYFULNESS OF THE WIND\n\n\nSince 1823, when the tavern of Montfermeil was on the way to shipwreck\nand was being gradually engulfed, not in the abyss of a bankruptcy, but\nin the cesspool of petty debts, the Thénardier pair had had two other\nchildren; both males. That made five; two girls and three boys.\n\nMadame Thénardier had got rid of the last two, while they were still\nyoung and very small, with remarkable luck.\n\n_Got rid of_ is the word. There was but a mere fragment of nature in\nthat woman. A phenomenon, by the way, of which there is more than one\nexample extant. Like the Maréchale de La Mothe-Houdancourt, the\nThénardier was a mother to her daughters only. There her maternity\nended. Her hatred of the human race began with her own sons. In the\ndirection of her sons her evil disposition was uncompromising, and her\nheart had a lugubrious wall in that quarter. As the reader has seen,\nshe detested the eldest; she cursed the other two. Why? Because. The\nmost terrible of motives, the most unanswerable of retorts—Because. “I\nhave no need of a litter of squalling brats,” said this mother.\n\nLet us explain how the Thénardiers had succeeded in getting rid of\ntheir last two children; and even in drawing profit from the operation.\n\nThe woman Magnon, who was mentioned a few pages further back, was the\nsame one who had succeeded in making old Gillenormand support the two\nchildren which she had had. She lived on the Quai des Célestins, at the\ncorner of this ancient street of the Petit-Musc which afforded her the\nopportunity of changing her evil repute into good odor. The reader will\nremember the great epidemic of croup which ravaged the river districts\nof the Seine in Paris thirty-five years ago, and of which science took\nadvantage to make experiments on a grand scale as to the efficacy of\ninhalations of alum, so beneficially replaced at the present day by the\nexternal tincture of iodine. During this epidemic, the Magnon lost both\nher boys, who were still very young, one in the morning, the other in\nthe evening of the same day. This was a blow. These children were\nprecious to their mother; they represented eighty francs a month. These\neighty francs were punctually paid in the name of M. Gillenormand, by\ncollector of his rents, M. Barge, a retired tip-staff, in the Rue du\nRoi-de-Sicile. The children dead, the income was at an end. The Magnon\nsought an expedient. In that dark free-masonry of evil of which she\nformed a part, everything is known, all secrets are kept, and all lend\nmutual aid. Magnon needed two children; the Thénardiers had two. The\nsame sex, the same age. A good arrangement for the one, a good\ninvestment for the other. The little Thénardiers became little Magnons.\nMagnon quitted the Quai des Célestins and went to live in the Rue\nClocheperce. In Paris, the identity which binds an individual to\nhimself is broken between one street and another.\n\nThe registry office being in no way warned, raised no objections, and\nthe substitution was effected in the most simple manner in the world.\nOnly, the Thénardier exacted for this loan of her children, ten francs\na month, which Magnon promised to pay, and which she actually did pay.\nIt is unnecessary to add that M. Gillenormand continued to perform his\ncompact. He came to see the children every six months. He did not\nperceive the change. “Monsieur,” Magnon said to him, “how much they\nresemble you!”\n\n\nThénardier, to whom avatars were easy, seized this occasion to become\nJondrette. His two daughters and Gavroche had hardly had time to\ndiscover that they had two little brothers. When a certain degree of\nmisery is reached, one is overpowered with a sort of spectral\nindifference, and one regards human beings as though they were\nspectres. Your nearest relations are often no more for you than vague\nshadowy forms, barely outlined against a nebulous background of life\nand easily confounded again with the invisible.\n\nOn the evening of the day when she had handed over her two little ones\nto Magnon, with express intention of renouncing them forever, the\nThénardier had felt, or had appeared to feel, a scruple. She said to\nher husband: “But this is abandoning our children!” Thénardier,\nmasterful and phlegmatic, cauterized the scruple with this saying:\n“Jean Jacques Rousseau did even better!” From scruples, the mother\nproceeded to uneasiness: “But what if the police were to annoy us? Tell\nme, Monsieur Thénardier, is what we have done permissible?” Thénardier\nreplied: “Everything is permissible. No one will see anything but true\nblue in it. Besides, no one has any interest in looking closely after\nchildren who have not a sou.”\n\n\nMagnon was a sort of fashionable woman in the sphere of crime. She was\ncareful about her toilet. She shared her lodgings, which were furnished\nin an affected and wretched style, with a clever gallicized English\nthief. This English woman, who had become a naturalized Parisienne,\nrecommended by very wealthy relations, intimately connected with the\nmedals in the Library and Mademoiselle Mar’s diamonds, became\ncelebrated later on in judicial accounts. She was called _Mamselle\nMiss_.\n\nThe two little creatures who had fallen to Magnon had no reason to\ncomplain of their lot. Recommended by the eighty francs, they were well\ncared for, as is everything from which profit is derived; they were\nneither badly clothed, nor badly fed; they were treated almost like\n“little gentlemen,”—better by their false mother than by their real\none. Magnon played the lady, and talked no thieves’ slang in their\npresence.\n\nThus passed several years. Thénardier augured well from the fact. One\nday, he chanced to say to Magnon as she handed him his monthly stipend\nof ten francs: “The father must give them some education.”\n\n\nAll at once, these two poor children, who had up to that time been\nprotected tolerably well, even by their evil fate, were abruptly hurled\ninto life and forced to begin it for themselves.\n\nA wholesale arrest of malefactors, like that in the Jondrette garret,\nnecessarily complicated by investigations and subsequent\nincarcerations, is a veritable disaster for that hideous and occult\ncounter-society which pursues its existence beneath public society; an\nadventure of this description entails all sorts of catastrophes in that\nsombre world. The Thénardier catastrophe involved the catastrophe of\nMagnon.\n\nOne day, a short time after Magnon had handed to Éponine the note\nrelating to the Rue Plumet, a sudden raid was made by the police in the\nRue Clocheperce; Magnon was seized, as was also Mamselle Miss; and all\nthe inhabitants of the house, which was of a suspicious character, were\ngathered into the net. While this was going on, the two little boys\nwere playing in the back yard, and saw nothing of the raid. When they\ntried to enter the house again, they found the door fastened and the\nhouse empty. A cobbler opposite called them to him, and delivered to\nthem a paper which “their mother” had left for them. On this paper\nthere was an address: _M. Barge, collector of rents, Rue du\nRoi-de-Sicile, No_. 8. The proprietor of the stall said to them: “You\ncannot live here any longer. Go there. It is nearby. The first street\non the left. Ask your way from this paper.”\n\n\nThe children set out, the elder leading the younger, and holding in his\nhand the paper which was to guide them. It was cold, and his benumbed\nlittle fingers could not close very firmly, and they did not keep a\nvery good hold on the paper. At the corner of the Rue Clocheperce, a\ngust of wind tore it from him, and as night was falling, the child was\nnot able to find it again.\n\nThey began to wander aimlessly through the streets.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—IN WHICH LITTLE GAVROCHE EXTRACTS PROFIT FROM NAPOLEON THE\nGREAT\n\n\nSpring in Paris is often traversed by harsh and piercing breezes which\ndo not precisely chill but freeze one; these north winds which sadden\nthe most beautiful days produce exactly the effect of those puffs of\ncold air which enter a warm room through the cracks of a badly fitting\ndoor or window. It seems as though the gloomy door of winter had\nremained ajar, and as though the wind were pouring through it. In the\nspring of 1832, the epoch when the first great epidemic of this century\nbroke out in Europe, these north gales were more harsh and piercing\nthan ever. It was a door even more glacial than that of winter which\nwas ajar. It was the door of the sepulchre. In these winds one felt the\nbreath of the cholera.\n\nFrom a meteorological point of view, these cold winds possessed this\npeculiarity, that they did not preclude a strong electric tension.\nFrequent storms, accompanied by thunder and lightning, burst forth at\nthis epoch.\n\nOne evening, when these gales were blowing rudely, to such a degree\nthat January seemed to have returned and that the bourgeois had resumed\ntheir cloaks, Little Gavroche, who was always shivering gayly under his\nrags, was standing as though in ecstasy before a wig-maker’s shop in\nthe vicinity of the Orme-Saint-Gervais. He was adorned with a woman’s\nwoollen shawl, picked up no one knows where, and which he had converted\ninto a neck comforter. Little Gavroche appeared to be engaged in intent\nadmiration of a wax bride, in a low-necked dress, and crowned with\norange-flowers, who was revolving in the window, and displaying her\nsmile to passers-by, between two argand lamps; but in reality, he was\ntaking an observation of the shop, in order to discover whether he\ncould not “prig” from the shop-front a cake of soap, which he would\nthen proceed to sell for a sou to a “hair-dresser” in the suburbs. He\nhad often managed to breakfast off of such a roll. He called his\nspecies of work, for which he possessed special aptitude, “shaving\nbarbers.”\n\n\nWhile contemplating the bride, and eyeing the cake of soap, he muttered\nbetween his teeth: “Tuesday. It was not Tuesday. Was it Tuesday?\nPerhaps it was Tuesday. Yes, it was Tuesday.”\n\n\nNo one has ever discovered to what this monologue referred.\n\nYes, perchance, this monologue had some connection with the last\noccasion on which he had dined, three days before, for it was now\nFriday.\n\nThe barber in his shop, which was warmed by a good stove, was shaving a\ncustomer and casting a glance from time to time at the enemy, that\nfreezing and impudent street urchin both of whose hands were in his\npockets, but whose mind was evidently unsheathed.\n\nWhile Gavroche was scrutinizing the shop-window and the cakes of\nwindsor soap, two children of unequal stature, very neatly dressed, and\nstill smaller than himself, one apparently about seven years of age,\nthe other five, timidly turned the handle and entered the shop, with a\nrequest for something or other, alms possibly, in a plaintive murmur\nwhich resembled a groan rather than a prayer. They both spoke at once,\nand their words were unintelligible because sobs broke the voice of the\nyounger, and the teeth of the elder were chattering with cold. The\nbarber wheeled round with a furious look, and without abandoning his\nrazor, thrust back the elder with his left hand and the younger with\nhis knee, and slammed his door, saying: “The idea of coming in and\nfreezing everybody for nothing!”\n\n\nThe two children resumed their march in tears. In the meantime, a cloud\nhad risen; it had begun to rain.\n\nLittle Gavroche ran after them and accosted them:—\n\n“What’s the matter with you, brats?”\n\n\n“We don’t know where we are to sleep,” replied the elder.\n\n“Is that all?” said Gavroche. “A great matter, truly. The idea of\nbawling about that. They must be greenies!”\n\n\nAnd adopting, in addition to his superiority, which was rather\nbantering, an accent of tender authority and gentle patronage:—\n\n“Come along with me, young ‘uns!”\n\n\n“Yes, sir,” said the elder.\n\nAnd the two children followed him as they would have followed an\narchbishop. They had stopped crying.\n\nGavroche led them up the Rue Saint-Antoine in the direction of the\nBastille.\n\nAs Gavroche walked along, he cast an indignant backward glance at the\nbarber’s shop.\n\n“That fellow has no heart, the whiting,\"35 he muttered. “He’s an\nEnglishman.”\n\n\nA woman who caught sight of these three marching in a file, with\nGavroche at their head, burst into noisy laughter. This laugh was\nwanting in respect towards the group.\n\n“Good day, Mamselle Omnibus,” said Gavroche to her.\n\nAn instant later, the wig-maker occurred to his mind once more, and he\nadded:—\n\n“I am making a mistake in the beast; he’s not a whiting, he’s a\nserpent. Barber, I’ll go and fetch a locksmith, and I’ll have a bell\nhung to your tail.”\n\n\nThis wig-maker had rendered him aggressive. As he strode over a gutter,\nhe apostrophized a bearded portress who was worthy to meet Faust on the\nBrocken, and who had a broom in her hand.\n\n“Madam,” said he, “so you are going out with your horse?”\n\n\nAnd thereupon, he spattered the polished boots of a pedestrian.\n\n“You scamp!” shouted the furious pedestrian.\n\nGavroche elevated his nose above his shawl.\n\n“Is Monsieur complaining?”\n\n\n“Of you!” ejaculated the man.\n\n“The office is closed,” said Gavroche, “I do not receive any more\ncomplaints.”\n\n\nIn the meanwhile, as he went on up the street, he perceived a\nbeggar-girl, thirteen or fourteen years old, and clad in so short a\ngown that her knees were visible, lying thoroughly chilled under a\nporte-cochère. The little girl was getting to be too old for such a\nthing. Growth does play these tricks. The petticoat becomes short at\nthe moment when nudity becomes indecent.\n\n“Poor girl!” said Gavroche. “She hasn’t even trousers. Hold on, take\nthis.”\n\n\nAnd unwinding all the comfortable woollen which he had around his neck,\nhe flung it on the thin and purple shoulders of the beggar-girl, where\nthe scarf became a shawl once more.\n\nThe child stared at him in astonishment, and received the shawl in\nsilence. When a certain stage of distress has been reached in his\nmisery, the poor man no longer groans over evil, no longer returns\nthanks for good.\n\nThat done: “Brrr!” said Gavroche, who was shivering more than Saint\nMartin, for the latter retained one-half of his cloak.\n\nAt this _brrr!_ the downpour of rain, redoubled in its spite, became\nfurious. The wicked skies punish good deeds.\n\n“Ah, come now!” exclaimed Gavroche, “what’s the meaning of this? It’s\nre-raining! Good Heavens, if it goes on like this, I shall stop my\nsubscription.”\n\n\nAnd he set out on the march once more.\n\n“It’s all right,” he resumed, casting a glance at the beggar-girl, as\nshe coiled up under the shawl, “she’s got a famous peel.”\n\n\nAnd looking up at the clouds he exclaimed:—\n\n“Caught!”\n\n\nThe two children followed close on his heels.\n\nAs they were passing one of these heavy grated lattices, which indicate\na baker’s shop, for bread is put behind bars like gold, Gavroche turned\nround:—\n\n“Ah, by the way, brats, have we dined?”\n\n\n“Monsieur,” replied the elder, “we have had nothing to eat since this\nmorning.”\n\n\n“So you have neither father nor mother?” resumed Gavroche majestically.\n\n“Excuse us, sir, we have a papa and a mamma, but we don’t know where\nthey are.”\n\n\n“Sometimes that’s better than knowing where they are,” said Gavroche,\nwho was a thinker.\n\n“We have been wandering about these two hours,” continued the elder,\n“we have hunted for things at the corners of the streets, but we have\nfound nothing.”\n\n\n“I know,” ejaculated Gavroche, “it’s the dogs who eat everything.”\n\n\nHe went on, after a pause:—\n\n“Ah! we have lost our authors. We don’t know what we have done with\nthem. This should not be, gamins. It’s stupid to let old people stray\noff like that. Come now! we must have a snooze all the same.”\n\n\nHowever, he asked them no questions. What was more simple than that\nthey should have no dwelling place!\n\nThe elder of the two children, who had almost entirely recovered the\nprompt heedlessness of childhood, uttered this exclamation:—\n\n“It’s queer, all the same. Mamma told us that she would take us to get\na blessed spray on Palm Sunday.”\n\n\n“Bosh,” said Gavroche.\n\n“Mamma,” resumed the elder, “is a lady who lives with Mamselle Miss.”\n\n\n“Tanflûte!” retorted Gavroche.\n\nMeanwhile he had halted, and for the last two minutes he had been\nfeeling and fumbling in all sorts of nooks which his rags contained.\n\nAt last he tossed his head with an air intended to be merely satisfied,\nbut which was triumphant, in reality.\n\n“Let us be calm, young ‘uns. Here’s supper for three.”\n\n\nAnd from one of his pockets he drew forth a sou.\n\nWithout allowing the two urchins time for amazement, he pushed both of\nthem before him into the baker’s shop, and flung his sou on the\ncounter, crying:—\n\n“Boy! five centimes’ worth of bread.”\n\n\nThe baker, who was the proprietor in person, took up a loaf and a\nknife.\n\n“In three pieces, my boy!” went on Gavroche.\n\nAnd he added with dignity:—\n\n“There are three of us.”\n\n\nAnd seeing that the baker, after scrutinizing the three customers, had\ntaken down a black loaf, he thrust his finger far up his nose with an\ninhalation as imperious as though he had had a pinch of the great\nFrederick’s snuff on the tip of his thumb, and hurled this indignant\napostrophe full in the baker’s face:—\n\n“Keksekça?”\n\n\nThose of our readers who might be tempted to espy in this\ninterpellation of Gavroche’s to the baker a Russian or a Polish word,\nor one of those savage cries which the Yoways and the Botocudos hurl at\neach other from bank to bank of a river, athwart the solitudes, are\nwarned that it is a word which they [our readers] utter every day, and\nwhich takes the place of the phrase: “Qu’est-ce que c’est que cela?”\nThe baker understood perfectly, and replied:—\n\n“Well! It’s bread, and very good bread of the second quality.”\n\n\n“You mean _larton brutal_ [black bread]!” retorted Gavroche, calmly and\ncoldly disdainful. “White bread, boy! white bread [_larton savonné_]!\nI’m standing treat.”\n\n\nThe baker could not repress a smile, and as he cut the white bread he\nsurveyed them in a compassionate way which shocked Gavroche.\n\n“Come, now, baker’s boy!” said he, “what are you taking our measure\nlike that for?”\n\n\nAll three of them placed end to end would have hardly made a measure.\n\nWhen the bread was cut, the baker threw the sou into his drawer, and\nGavroche said to the two children:—\n\n“Grub away.”\n\n\nThe little boys stared at him in surprise.\n\nGavroche began to laugh.\n\n“Ah! hullo, that’s so! they don’t understand yet, they’re too small.”\n\n\nAnd he repeated:—\n\n“Eat away.”\n\n\nAt the same time, he held out a piece of bread to each of them.\n\nAnd thinking that the elder, who seemed to him the more worthy of his\nconversation, deserved some special encouragement and ought to be\nrelieved from all hesitation to satisfy his appetite, he added, as he\nhanded him the largest share:—\n\n“Ram that into your muzzle.”\n\n\nOne piece was smaller than the others; he kept this for himself.\n\nThe poor children, including Gavroche, were famished. As they tore\ntheir bread apart in big mouthfuls, they blocked up the shop of the\nbaker, who, now that they had paid their money, looked angrily at them.\n\n“Let’s go into the street again,” said Gavroche.\n\nThey set off once more in the direction of the Bastille.\n\nFrom time to time, as they passed the lighted shop-windows, the\nsmallest halted to look at the time on a leaden watch which was\nsuspended from his neck by a cord.\n\n“Well, he is a very green ‘un,” said Gavroche.\n\nThen, becoming thoughtful, he muttered between his teeth:—\n\n“All the same, if I had charge of the babes I’d lock ‘em up better than\nthat.”\n\n\nJust as they were finishing their morsel of bread, and had reached the\nangle of that gloomy Rue des Ballets, at the other end of which the low\nand threatening wicket of La Force was visible:—\n\n“Hullo, is that you, Gavroche?” said some one.\n\n“Hullo, is that you, Montparnasse?” said Gavroche.\n\nA man had just accosted the street urchin, and the man was no other\nthan Montparnasse in disguise, with blue spectacles, but recognizable\nto Gavroche.\n\n“The bow-wows!” went on Gavroche, “you’ve got a hide the color of a\nlinseed plaster, and blue specs like a doctor. You’re putting on style,\n‘pon my word!”\n\n\n“Hush!” ejaculated Montparnasse, “not so loud.”\n\n\nAnd he drew Gavroche hastily out of range of the lighted shops.\n\nThe two little ones followed mechanically, holding each other by the\nhand.\n\nWhen they were ensconced under the arch of a porte-cochère, sheltered\nfrom the rain and from all eyes:—\n\n“Do you know where I’m going?” demanded Montparnasse.\n\n“To the Abbey of Ascend-with-Regret,\"36 replied Gavroche.\n\n“Joker!”\n\n\nAnd Montparnasse went on:—\n\n“I’m going to find Babet.”\n\n\n“Ah!” exclaimed Gavroche, “so her name is Babet.”\n\n\nMontparnasse lowered his voice:—\n\n“Not she, he.”\n\n\n“Ah! Babet.”\n\n\n“Yes, Babet.”\n\n\n“I thought he was buckled.”\n\n\n“He has undone the buckle,” replied Montparnasse.\n\nAnd he rapidly related to the gamin how, on the morning of that very\nday, Babet, having been transferred to La Conciergerie, had made his\nescape, by turning to the left instead of to the right in “the police\noffice.”\n\n\nGavroche expressed his admiration for this skill.\n\n“What a dentist!” he cried.\n\nMontparnasse added a few details as to Babet’s flight, and ended with:—\n\n“Oh! That’s not all.”\n\n\nGavroche, as he listened, had seized a cane that Montparnasse held in\nhis hand, and mechanically pulled at the upper part, and the blade of a\ndagger made its appearance.\n\n“Ah!” he exclaimed, pushing the dagger back in haste, “you have brought\nalong your gendarme disguised as a bourgeois.”\n\n\nMontparnasse winked.\n\n“The deuce!” resumed Gavroche, “so you’re going to have a bout with the\nbobbies?”\n\n\n“You can’t tell,” replied Montparnasse with an indifferent air. “It’s\nalways a good thing to have a pin about one.”\n\n\nGavroche persisted:—\n\n“What are you up to to-night?”\n\n\nAgain Montparnasse took a grave tone, and said, mouthing every\nsyllable: “Things.”\n\n\nAnd abruptly changing the conversation:—\n\n“By the way!”\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“Something happened t’other day. Fancy. I meet a bourgeois. He makes me\na present of a sermon and his purse. I put it in my pocket. A minute\nlater, I feel in my pocket. There’s nothing there.”\n\n\n“Except the sermon,” said Gavroche.\n\n“But you,” went on Montparnasse, “where are you bound for now?”\n\n\nGavroche pointed to his two protégés, and said:—\n\n“I’m going to put these infants to bed.”\n\n\n“Whereabouts is the bed?”\n\n\n“At my house.”\n\n\n“Where’s your house?”\n\n\n“At my house.”\n\n\n“So you have a lodging?”\n\n\n“Yes, I have.”\n\n\n“And where is your lodging?”\n\n\n“In the elephant,” said Gavroche.\n\nMontparnasse, though not naturally inclined to astonishment, could not\nrestrain an exclamation.\n\n“In the elephant!”\n\n\n“Well, yes, in the elephant!” retorted Gavroche. “Kekçaa?”\n\n\nThis is another word of the language which no one writes, and which\nevery one speaks.\n\nKekçaa signifies: _Qu’est que c’est que cela a? _ [What’s the matter\nwith that?]\n\nThe urchin’s profound remark recalled Montparnasse to calmness and good\nsense. He appeared to return to better sentiments with regard to\nGavroche’s lodging.\n\n“Of course,” said he, “yes, the elephant. Is it comfortable there?”\n\n\n“Very,” said Gavroche. “It’s really bully there. There ain’t any\ndraughts, as there are under the bridges.”\n\n\n“How do you get in?”\n\n\n“Oh, I get in.”\n\n\n“So there is a hole?” demanded Montparnasse.\n\n“Parbleu! I should say so. But you mustn’t tell. It’s between the fore\nlegs. The bobbies haven’t seen it.”\n\n\n“And you climb up? Yes, I understand.”\n\n\n“A turn of the hand, cric, crac, and it’s all over, no one there.”\n\n\nAfter a pause, Gavroche added:—\n\n“I shall have a ladder for these children.”\n\n\nMontparnasse burst out laughing:—\n\n“Where the devil did you pick up those young ‘uns?”\n\n\nGavroche replied with great simplicity:—\n\n“They are some brats that a wig-maker made me a present of.”\n\n\nMeanwhile, Montparnasse had fallen to thinking:—\n\n“You recognized me very readily,” he muttered.\n\nHe took from his pocket two small objects which were nothing more than\ntwo quills wrapped in cotton, and thrust one up each of his nostrils.\nThis gave him a different nose.\n\n“That changes you,” remarked Gavroche, “you are less homely so, you\nought to keep them on all the time.”\n\n\nMontparnasse was a handsome fellow, but Gavroche was a tease.\n\n“Seriously,” demanded Montparnasse, “how do you like me so?”\n\n\nThe sound of his voice was different also. In a twinkling, Montparnasse\nhad become unrecognizable.\n\n“Oh! Do play Porrichinelle for us!” exclaimed Gavroche.\n\nThe two children, who had not been listening up to this point, being\noccupied themselves in thrusting their fingers up their noses, drew\nnear at this name, and stared at Montparnasse with dawning joy and\nadmiration.\n\nUnfortunately, Montparnasse was troubled.\n\nHe laid his hand on Gavroche’s shoulder, and said to him, emphasizing\nhis words: “Listen to what I tell you, boy! if I were on the square\nwith my dog, my knife, and my wife, and if you were to squander ten\nsous on me, I wouldn’t refuse to work, but this isn’t Shrove Tuesday.”\n\n\nThis odd phrase produced a singular effect on the gamin. He wheeled\nround hastily, darted his little sparkling eyes about him with profound\nattention, and perceived a police sergeant standing with his back to\nthem a few paces off. Gavroche allowed an: “Ah! good!” to escape him,\nbut immediately suppressed it, and shaking Montparnasse’s hand:—\n\n“Well, good evening,” said he, “I’m going off to my elephant with my\nbrats. Supposing that you should need me some night, you can come and\nhunt me up there. I lodge on the entresol. There is no porter. You will\ninquire for Monsieur Gavroche.”\n\n\n“Very good,” said Montparnasse.\n\nAnd they parted, Montparnasse betaking himself in the direction of the\nGrève, and Gavroche towards the Bastille. The little one of five,\ndragged along by his brother who was dragged by Gavroche, turned his\nhead back several times to watch “Porrichinelle” as he went.\n\nThe ambiguous phrase by means of which Montparnasse had warned Gavroche\nof the presence of the policeman, contained no other talisman than the\nassonance _dig_ repeated five or six times in different forms. This\nsyllable, _dig_, uttered alone or artistically mingled with the words\nof a phrase, means: “Take care, we can no longer talk freely.” There\nwas besides, in Montparnasse’s sentence, a literary beauty which was\nlost upon Gavroche, that is _mon dogue, ma dague et ma digue_, a slang\nexpression of the Temple, which signifies my dog, my knife, and my\nwife, greatly in vogue among clowns and the red-tails in the great\ncentury when Molière wrote and Callot drew.\n\nTwenty years ago, there was still to be seen in the southwest corner of\nthe Place de la Bastille, near the basin of the canal, excavated in the\nancient ditch of the fortress-prison, a singular monument, which has\nalready been effaced from the memories of Parisians, and which deserved\nto leave some trace, for it was the idea of a “member of the Institute,\nthe General-in-chief of the army of Egypt.”\n\n\nWe say monument, although it was only a rough model. But this model\nitself, a marvellous sketch, the grandiose skeleton of an idea of\nNapoleon’s, which successive gusts of wind have carried away and\nthrown, on each occasion, still further from us, had become historical\nand had acquired a certain definiteness which contrasted with its\nprovisional aspect. It was an elephant forty feet high, constructed of\ntimber and masonry, bearing on its back a tower which resembled a\nhouse, formerly painted green by some dauber, and now painted black by\nheaven, the wind, and time. In this deserted and unprotected corner of\nthe place, the broad brow of the colossus, his trunk, his tusks, his\ntower, his enormous crupper, his four feet, like columns produced, at\nnight, under the starry heavens, a surprising and terrible form. It was\na sort of symbol of popular force. It was sombre, mysterious, and\nimmense. It was some mighty, visible phantom, one knew not what,\nstanding erect beside the invisible spectre of the Bastille.\n\nFew strangers visited this edifice, no passer-by looked at it. It was\nfalling into ruins; every season the plaster which detached itself from\nits sides formed hideous wounds upon it. “The ædiles,” as the\nexpression ran in elegant dialect, had forgotten it ever since 1814.\nThere it stood in its corner, melancholy, sick, crumbling, surrounded\nby a rotten palisade, soiled continually by drunken coachmen; cracks\nmeandered athwart its belly, a lath projected from its tail, tall grass\nflourished between its legs; and, as the level of the place had been\nrising all around it for a space of thirty years, by that slow and\ncontinuous movement which insensibly elevates the soil of large towns,\nit stood in a hollow, and it looked as though the ground were giving\nway beneath it. It was unclean, despised, repulsive, and superb, ugly\nin the eyes of the bourgeois, melancholy in the eyes of the thinker.\nThere was something about it of the dirt which is on the point of being\nswept out, and something of the majesty which is on the point of being\ndecapitated. As we have said, at night, its aspect changed. Night is\nthe real element of everything that is dark. As soon as twilight\ndescended, the old elephant became transfigured; he assumed a tranquil\nand redoubtable appearance in the formidable serenity of the shadows.\nBeing of the past, he belonged to night; and obscurity was in keeping\nwith his grandeur.\n\nThis rough, squat, heavy, hard, austere, almost misshapen, but\nassuredly majestic monument, stamped with a sort of magnificent and\nsavage gravity, has disappeared, and left to reign in peace, a sort of\ngigantic stove, ornamented with its pipe, which has replaced the sombre\nfortress with its nine towers, very much as the bourgeoisie replaces\nthe feudal classes. It is quite natural that a stove should be the\nsymbol of an epoch in which a pot contains power. This epoch will pass\naway, people have already begun to understand that, if there can be\nforce in a boiler, there can be no force except in the brain; in other\nwords, that which leads and drags on the world, is not locomotives, but\nideas. Harness locomotives to ideas,—that is well done; but do not\nmistake the horse for the rider.\n\nAt all events, to return to the Place de la Bastille, the architect of\nthis elephant succeeded in making a grand thing out of plaster; the\narchitect of the stove has succeeded in making a pretty thing out of\nbronze.\n\nThis stove-pipe, which has been baptized by a sonorous name, and called\nthe column of July, this monument of a revolution that miscarried, was\nstill enveloped in 1832, in an immense shirt of woodwork, which we\nregret, for our part, and by a vast plank enclosure, which completed\nthe task of isolating the elephant.\n\nIt was towards this corner of the place, dimly lighted by the\nreflection of a distant street lamp, that the gamin guided his two\n“brats.”\n\n\nThe reader must permit us to interrupt ourselves here and to remind him\nthat we are dealing with simple reality, and that twenty years ago, the\ntribunals were called upon to judge, under the charge of vagabondage,\nand mutilation of a public monument, a child who had been caught asleep\nin this very elephant of the Bastille. This fact noted, we proceed.\n\nOn arriving in the vicinity of the colossus, Gavroche comprehended the\neffect which the infinitely great might produce on the infinitely\nsmall, and said:—\n\n“Don’t be scared, infants.”\n\n\nThen he entered through a gap in the fence into the elephant’s\nenclosure and helped the young ones to clamber through the breach. The\ntwo children, somewhat frightened, followed Gavroche without uttering a\nword, and confided themselves to this little Providence in rags which\nhad given them bread and had promised them a shelter.\n\nThere, extended along the fence, lay a ladder which by day served the\nlaborers in the neighboring timber-yard. Gavroche raised it with\nremarkable vigor, and placed it against one of the elephant’s forelegs.\nNear the point where the ladder ended, a sort of black hole in the\nbelly of the colossus could be distinguished.\n\nGavroche pointed out the ladder and the hole to his guests, and said to\nthem:—\n\n“Climb up and go in.”\n\n\nThe two little boys exchanged terrified glances.\n\n“You’re afraid, brats!” exclaimed Gavroche.\n\nAnd he added:—\n\n“You shall see!”\n\n\nHe clasped the rough leg of the elephant, and in a twinkling, without\ndeigning to make use of the ladder, he had reached the aperture. He\nentered it as an adder slips through a crevice, and disappeared within,\nand an instant later, the two children saw his head, which looked pale,\nappear vaguely, on the edge of the shadowy hole, like a wan and whitish\nspectre.\n\n“Well!” he exclaimed, “climb up, young ‘uns! You’ll see how snug it is\nhere! Come up, you!” he said to the elder, “I’ll lend you a hand.”\n\n\nThe little fellows nudged each other, the gamin frightened and inspired\nthem with confidence at one and the same time, and then, it was raining\nvery hard. The elder one undertook the risk. The younger, on seeing his\nbrother climbing up, and himself left alone between the paws of this\nhuge beast, felt greatly inclined to cry, but he did not dare.\n\nThe elder lad climbed, with uncertain steps, up the rungs of the\nladder; Gavroche, in the meanwhile, encouraging him with exclamations\nlike a fencing-master to his pupils, or a muleteer to his mules.\n\n“Don’t be afraid!—That’s it!—Come on!—Put your feet there!—Give us your\nhand here!—Boldly!”\n\n\nAnd when the child was within reach, he seized him suddenly and\nvigorously by the arm, and pulled him towards him.\n\n“Nabbed!” said he.\n\nThe brat had passed through the crack.\n\n“Now,” said Gavroche, “wait for me. Be so good as to take a seat,\nMonsieur.”\n\n\nAnd making his way out of the hole as he had entered it, he slipped\ndown the elephant’s leg with the agility of a monkey, landed on his\nfeet in the grass, grasped the child of five round the body, and\nplanted him fairly in the middle of the ladder, then he began to climb\nup behind him, shouting to the elder:—\n\n“I’m going to boost him, do you tug.”\n\n\nAnd in another instant, the small lad was pushed, dragged, pulled,\nthrust, stuffed into the hole, before he had time to recover himself,\nand Gavroche, entering behind him, and repulsing the ladder with a kick\nwhich sent it flat on the grass, began to clap his hands and to cry:—\n\n“Here we are! Long live General Lafayette!”\n\n\nThis explosion over, he added:—\n\n“Now, young ‘uns, you are in my house.”\n\n\nGavroche was at home, in fact.\n\nOh, unforeseen utility of the useless! Charity of great things!\nGoodness of giants! This huge monument, which had embodied an idea of\nthe Emperor’s, had become the box of a street urchin. The brat had been\naccepted and sheltered by the colossus. The bourgeois decked out in\ntheir Sunday finery who passed the elephant of the Bastille, were fond\nof saying as they scanned it disdainfully with their prominent eyes:\n“What’s the good of that?” It served to save from the cold, the frost,\nthe hail, and rain, to shelter from the winds of winter, to preserve\nfrom slumber in the mud which produces fever, and from slumber in the\nsnow which produces death, a little being who had no father, no mother,\nno bread, no clothes, no refuge. It served to receive the innocent whom\nsociety repulsed. It served to diminish public crime. It was a lair\nopen to one against whom all doors were shut. It seemed as though the\nmiserable old mastodon, invaded by vermin and oblivion, covered with\nwarts, with mould, and ulcers, tottering, worm-eaten, abandoned,\ncondemned, a sort of mendicant colossus, asking alms in vain with a\nbenevolent look in the midst of the crossroads, had taken pity on that\nother mendicant, the poor pygmy, who roamed without shoes to his feet,\nwithout a roof over his head, blowing on his fingers, clad in rags, fed\non rejected scraps. That was what the elephant of the Bastille was good\nfor. This idea of Napoleon, disdained by men, had been taken back by\nGod. That which had been merely illustrious, had become august. In\norder to realize his thought, the Emperor should have had porphyry,\nbrass, iron, gold, marble; the old collection of planks, beams and\nplaster sufficed for God. The Emperor had had the dream of a genius; in\nthat Titanic elephant, armed, prodigious, with trunk uplifted, bearing\nits tower and scattering on all sides its merry and vivifying waters,\nhe wished to incarnate the people. God had done a grander thing with\nit, he had lodged a child there.\n\nThe hole through which Gavroche had entered was a breach which was\nhardly visible from the outside, being concealed, as we have stated,\nbeneath the elephant’s belly, and so narrow that it was only cats and\nhomeless children who could pass through it.\n\n“Let’s begin,” said Gavroche, “by telling the porter that we are not at\nhome.”\n\n\nAnd plunging into the darkness with the assurance of a person who is\nwell acquainted with his apartments, he took a plank and stopped up the\naperture.\n\nAgain Gavroche plunged into the obscurity. The children heard the\ncrackling of the match thrust into the phosphoric bottle. The chemical\nmatch was not yet in existence; at that epoch the Fumade steel\nrepresented progress.\n\nA sudden light made them blink; Gavroche had just managed to ignite one\nof those bits of cord dipped in resin which are called _cellar rats_.\nThe _cellar rat_, which emitted more smoke than light, rendered the\ninterior of the elephant confusedly visible.\n\nGavroche’s two guests glanced about them, and the sensation which they\nexperienced was something like that which one would feel if shut up in\nthe great tun of Heidelberg, or, better still, like what Jonah must\nhave felt in the biblical belly of the whale. An entire and gigantic\nskeleton appeared enveloping them. Above, a long brown beam, whence\nstarted at regular distances, massive, arching ribs, represented the\nvertebral column with its sides, stalactites of plaster depended from\nthem like entrails, and vast spiders’ webs stretching from side to\nside, formed dirty diaphragms. Here and there, in the corners, were\nvisible large blackish spots which had the appearance of being alive,\nand which changed places rapidly with an abrupt and frightened\nmovement.\n\nFragments which had fallen from the elephant’s back into his belly had\nfilled up the cavity, so that it was possible to walk upon it as on a\nfloor.\n\nThe smaller child nestled up against his brother, and whispered to\nhim:—\n\n“It’s black.”\n\n\nThis remark drew an exclamation from Gavroche. The petrified air of the\ntwo brats rendered some shock necessary.\n\n“What’s that you are gabbling about there?” he exclaimed. “Are you\nscoffing at me? Are you turning up your noses? Do you want the\nTuileries? Are you brutes? Come, say! I warn you that I don’t belong to\nthe regiment of simpletons. Ah, come now, are you brats from the Pope’s\nestablishment?”\n\n\nA little roughness is good in cases of fear. It is reassuring. The two\nchildren drew close to Gavroche.\n\nGavroche, paternally touched by this confidence, passed from grave to\ngentle, and addressing the smaller:—\n\n“Stupid,” said he, accenting the insulting word, with a caressing\nintonation, “it’s outside that it is black. Outside it’s raining, here\nit does not rain; outside it’s cold, here there’s not an atom of wind;\noutside there are heaps of people, here there’s no one; outside there\nain’t even the moon, here there’s my candle, confound it!”\n\n\nThe two children began to look upon the apartment with less terror; but\nGavroche allowed them no more time for contemplation.\n\n“Quick,” said he.\n\nAnd he pushed them towards what we are very glad to be able to call the\nend of the room.\n\nThere stood his bed.\n\nGavroche’s bed was complete; that is to say, it had a mattress, a\nblanket, and an alcove with curtains.\n\nThe mattress was a straw mat, the blanket a rather large strip of gray\nwoollen stuff, very warm and almost new. This is what the alcove\nconsisted of:—\n\nThree rather long poles, thrust into and consolidated, with the rubbish\nwhich formed the floor, that is to say, the belly of the elephant, two\nin front and one behind, and united by a rope at their summits, so as\nto form a pyramidal bundle. This cluster supported a trellis-work of\nbrass wire which was simply placed upon it, but artistically applied,\nand held by fastenings of iron wire, so that it enveloped all three\nholes. A row of very heavy stones kept this network down to the floor\nso that nothing could pass under it. This grating was nothing else than\na piece of the brass screens with which aviaries are covered in\nmenageries. Gavroche’s bed stood as in a cage, behind this net. The\nwhole resembled an Esquimaux tent.\n\nThis trellis-work took the place of curtains.\n\nGavroche moved aside the stones which fastened the net down in front,\nand the two folds of the net which lapped over each other fell apart.\n\n“Down on all fours, brats!” said Gavroche.\n\nHe made his guests enter the cage with great precaution, then he\ncrawled in after them, pulled the stones together, and closed the\nopening hermetically again.\n\nAll three had stretched out on the mat. Gavroche still had the _cellar\nrat_ in his hand.\n\n“Now,” said he, “go to sleep! I’m going to suppress the candelabra.”\n\n\n“Monsieur,” the elder of the brothers asked Gavroche, pointing to the\nnetting, “what’s that for?”\n\n\n“That,” answered Gavroche gravely, “is for the rats. Go to sleep!”\n\n\nNevertheless, he felt obliged to add a few words of instruction for the\nbenefit of these young creatures, and he continued:—\n\n“It’s a thing from the Jardin des Plantes. It’s used for fierce\nanimals. There’s a whole shopful of them there. All you’ve got to do is\nto climb over a wall, crawl through a window, and pass through a door.\nYou can get as much as you want.”\n\n\nAs he spoke, he wrapped the younger one up bodily in a fold of the\nblanket, and the little one murmured:—\n\n“Oh! how good that is! It’s warm!”\n\n\nGavroche cast a pleased eye on the blanket.\n\n“That’s from the Jardin des Plantes, too,” said he. “I took that from\nthe monkeys.”\n\n\nAnd, pointing out to the eldest the mat on which he was lying, a very\nthick and admirably made mat, he added:—\n\n“That belonged to the giraffe.”\n\n\nAfter a pause he went on:—\n\n“The beasts had all these things. I took them away from them. It didn’t\ntrouble them. I told them: ‘It’s for the elephant.’”\n\n\nHe paused, and then resumed:—\n\n“You crawl over the walls and you don’t care a straw for the\ngovernment. So there now!”\n\n\nThe two children gazed with timid and stupefied respect on this\nintrepid and ingenious being, a vagabond like themselves, isolated like\nthemselves, frail like themselves, who had something admirable and\nall-powerful about him, who seemed supernatural to them, and whose\nphysiognomy was composed of all the grimaces of an old mountebank,\nmingled with the most ingenuous and charming smiles.\n\n“Monsieur,” ventured the elder timidly, “you are not afraid of the\npolice, then?”\n\n\nGavroche contented himself with replying:—\n\n“Brat! Nobody says ‘police,’ they say ‘bobbies.’”\n\n\nThe smaller had his eyes wide open, but he said nothing. As he was on\nthe edge of the mat, the elder being in the middle, Gavroche tucked the\nblanket round him as a mother might have done, and heightened the mat\nunder his head with old rags, in such a way as to form a pillow for the\nchild. Then he turned to the elder:—\n\n“Hey! We’re jolly comfortable here, ain’t we?”\n\n\n“Ah, yes!” replied the elder, gazing at Gavroche with the expression of\na saved angel.\n\nThe two poor little children who had been soaked through, began to grow\nwarm once more.\n\n“Ah, by the way,” continued Gavroche, “what were you bawling about?”\n\n\nAnd pointing out the little one to his brother:—\n\n“A mite like that, I’ve nothing to say about, but the idea of a big\nfellow like you crying! It’s idiotic; you looked like a calf.”\n\n\n“Gracious,” replied the child, “we have no lodging.”\n\n\n“Bother!” retorted Gavroche, “you don’t say ‘lodgings,’ you say\n‘crib.’”\n\n\n“And then, we were afraid of being alone like that at night.”\n\n\n“You don’t say ‘night,’ you say ‘darkmans.’”\n\n\n“Thank you, sir,” said the child.\n\n“Listen,” went on Gavroche, “you must never bawl again over anything.\nI’ll take care of you. You shall see what fun we’ll have. In summer,\nwe’ll go to the Glacière with Navet, one of my pals, we’ll bathe in the\nGare, we’ll run stark naked in front of the rafts on the bridge at\nAusterlitz,—that makes the laundresses raging. They scream, they get\nmad, and if you only knew how ridiculous they are! We’ll go and see the\nman-skeleton. And then I’ll take you to the play. I’ll take you to see\nFrédérick Lemaître. I have tickets, I know some of the actors, I even\nplayed in a piece once. There were a lot of us fellers, and we ran\nunder a cloth, and that made the sea. I’ll get you an engagement at my\ntheatre. We’ll go to see the savages. They ain’t real, those savages\nain’t. They wear pink tights that go all in wrinkles, and you can see\nwhere their elbows have been darned with white. Then, we’ll go to the\nOpera. We’ll get in with the hired applauders. The Opera claque is well\nmanaged. I wouldn’t associate with the claque on the boulevard. At the\nOpera, just fancy! some of them pay twenty sous, but they’re ninnies.\nThey’re called dishclouts. And then we’ll go to see the guillotine\nwork. I’ll show you the executioner. He lives in the Rue des Marais.\nMonsieur Sanson. He has a letter-box at his door. Ah! we’ll have famous\nfun!”\n\n\nAt that moment a drop of wax fell on Gavroche’s finger, and recalled\nhim to the realities of life.\n\n“The deuce!” said he, “there’s the wick giving out. Attention! I can’t\nspend more than a sou a month on my lighting. When a body goes to bed,\nhe must sleep. We haven’t the time to read M. Paul de Kock’s romances.\nAnd besides, the light might pass through the cracks of the\nporte-cochère, and all the bobbies need to do is to see it.”\n\n\n“And then,” remarked the elder timidly,—he alone dared talk to\nGavroche, and reply to him, “a spark might fall in the straw, and we\nmust look out and not burn the house down.”\n\n\n“People don’t say ‘burn the house down,’” remarked Gavroche, “they say\n‘blaze the crib.’”\n\n\nThe storm increased in violence, and the heavy downpour beat upon the\nback of the colossus amid claps of thunder. “You’re taken in, rain!”\nsaid Gavroche. “It amuses me to hear the decanter run down the legs of\nthe house. Winter is a stupid; it wastes its merchandise, it loses its\nlabor, it can’t wet us, and that makes it kick up a row, old\nwater-carrier that it is.”\n\n\nThis allusion to the thunder, all the consequences of which Gavroche,\nin his character of a philosopher of the nineteenth century, accepted,\nwas followed by a broad flash of lightning, so dazzling that a hint of\nit entered the belly of the elephant through the crack. Almost at the\nsame instant, the thunder rumbled with great fury. The two little\ncreatures uttered a shriek, and started up so eagerly that the network\ncame near being displaced, but Gavroche turned his bold face to them,\nand took advantage of the clap of thunder to burst into a laugh.\n\n“Calm down, children. Don’t topple over the edifice. That’s fine,\nfirst-class thunder; all right. That’s no slouch of a streak of\nlightning. Bravo for the good God! Deuce take it! It’s almost as good\nas it is at the Ambigu.”\n\n\nThat said, he restored order in the netting, pushed the two children\ngently down on the bed, pressed their knees, in order to stretch them\nout at full length, and exclaimed:—\n\n“Since the good God is lighting his candle, I can blow out mine. Now,\nbabes, now, my young humans, you must shut your peepers. It’s very bad\nnot to sleep. It’ll make you swallow the strainer, or, as they say, in\nfashionable society, stink in the gullet. Wrap yourself up well in the\nhide! I’m going to put out the light. Are you ready?”\n\n\n“Yes,” murmured the elder, “I’m all right. I seem to have feathers\nunder my head.”\n\n\n“People don’t say ‘head,’” cried Gavroche, “they say ‘nut’.”\n\n\nThe two children nestled close to each other, Gavroche finished\narranging them on the mat, drew the blanket up to their very ears, then\nrepeated, for the third time, his injunction in the hieratical tongue:—\n\n“Shut your peepers!”\n\n\nAnd he snuffed out his tiny light.\n\nHardly had the light been extinguished, when a peculiar trembling began\nto affect the netting under which the three children lay.\n\nIt consisted of a multitude of dull scratches which produced a metallic\nsound, as if claws and teeth were gnawing at the copper wire. This was\naccompanied by all sorts of little piercing cries.\n\nThe little five-year-old boy, on hearing this hubbub overhead, and\nchilled with terror, jogged his brother’s elbow; but the elder brother\nhad already shut his peepers, as Gavroche had ordered. Then the little\none, who could no longer control his terror, questioned Gavroche, but\nin a very low tone, and with bated breath:—\n\n“Sir?”\n\n\n“Hey?” said Gavroche, who had just closed his eyes.\n\n“What is that?”\n\n\n“It’s the rats,” replied Gavroche.\n\nAnd he laid his head down on the mat again.\n\nThe rats, in fact, who swarmed by thousands in the carcass of the\nelephant, and who were the living black spots which we have already\nmentioned, had been held in awe by the flame of the candle, so long as\nit had been lighted; but as soon as the cavern, which was the same as\ntheir city, had returned to darkness, scenting what the good\nstory-teller Perrault calls “fresh meat,” they had hurled themselves in\nthrongs on Gavroche’s tent, had climbed to the top of it, and had begun\nto bite the meshes as though seeking to pierce this new-fangled trap.\n\nStill the little one could not sleep.\n\n“Sir?” he began again.\n\n“Hey?” said Gavroche.\n\n“What are rats?”\n\n\n“They are mice.”\n\n\nThis explanation reassured the child a little. He had seen white mice\nin the course of his life, and he was not afraid of them. Nevertheless,\nhe lifted up his voice once more.\n\n“Sir?”\n\n\n“Hey?” said Gavroche again.\n\n“Why don’t you have a cat?”\n\n\n“I did have one,” replied Gavroche, “I brought one here, but they ate\nher.”\n\n\nThis second explanation undid the work of the first, and the little\nfellow began to tremble again.\n\nThe dialogue between him and Gavroche began again for the fourth time:—\n\n“Monsieur?”\n\n\n“Hey?”\n\n\n“Who was it that was eaten?”\n\n\n“The cat.”\n\n\n“And who ate the cat?”\n\n\n“The rats.”\n\n\n“The mice?”\n\n\n“Yes, the rats.”\n\n\nThe child, in consternation, dismayed at the thought of mice which ate\ncats, pursued:—\n\n“Sir, would those mice eat us?”\n\n\n“Wouldn’t they just!” ejaculated Gavroche.\n\nThe child’s terror had reached its climax. But Gavroche added:—\n\n“Don’t be afraid. They can’t get in. And besides, I’m here! Here, catch\nhold of my hand. Hold your tongue and shut your peepers!”\n\n\nAt the same time Gavroche grasped the little fellow’s hand across his\nbrother. The child pressed the hand close to him, and felt reassured.\nCourage and strength have these mysterious ways of communicating\nthemselves. Silence reigned round them once more, the sound of their\nvoices had frightened off the rats; at the expiration of a few minutes,\nthey came raging back, but in vain, the three little fellows were fast\nasleep and heard nothing more.\n\nThe hours of the night fled away. Darkness covered the vast Place de la\nBastille. A wintry gale, which mingled with the rain, blew in gusts,\nthe patrol searched all the doorways, alleys, enclosures, and obscure\nnooks, and in their search for nocturnal vagabonds they passed in\nsilence before the elephant; the monster, erect, motionless, staring\nopen-eyed into the shadows, had the appearance of dreaming happily over\nhis good deed; and sheltered from heaven and from men the three poor\nsleeping children.\n\nIn order to understand what is about to follow, the reader must\nremember, that, at that epoch, the Bastille guard-house was situated at\nthe other end of the square, and that what took place in the vicinity\nof the elephant could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel.\n\nTowards the end of that hour which immediately precedes the dawn, a man\nturned from the Rue Saint-Antoine at a run, made the circuit of the\nenclosure of the column of July, and glided between the palings until\nhe was underneath the belly of the elephant. If any light had\nilluminated that man, it might have been divined from the thorough\nmanner in which he was soaked that he had passed the night in the rain.\nArrived beneath the elephant, he uttered a peculiar cry, which did not\nbelong to any human tongue, and which a paroquet alone could have\nimitated. Twice he repeated this cry, of whose orthography the\nfollowing barely conveys an idea:—\n\n“Kirikikiou!”\n\n\nAt the second cry, a clear, young, merry voice responded from the belly\nof the elephant:—\n\n“Yes!”\n\n\nAlmost immediately, the plank which closed the hole was drawn aside,\nand gave passage to a child who descended the elephant’s leg, and fell\nbriskly near the man. It was Gavroche. The man was Montparnasse.\n\nAs for his cry of _Kirikikiou_,—that was, doubtless, what the child had\nmeant, when he said:—\n\n“You will ask for Monsieur Gavroche.”\n\n\nOn hearing it, he had waked with a start, had crawled out of his\n“alcove,” pushing apart the netting a little, and carefully drawing it\ntogether again, then he had opened the trap, and descended.\n\nThe man and the child recognized each other silently amid the gloom:\nMontparnasse confined himself to the remark:—\n\n“We need you. Come, lend us a hand.”\n\n\nThe lad asked for no further enlightenment.\n\n“I’m with you,” said he.\n\nAnd both took their way towards the Rue Saint-Antoine, whence\nMontparnasse had emerged, winding rapidly through the long file of\nmarket-gardeners’ carts which descend towards the markets at that hour.\n\nThe market-gardeners, crouching, half-asleep, in their wagons, amid the\nsalads and vegetables, enveloped to their very eyes in their mufflers\non account of the beating rain, did not even glance at these strange\npedestrians.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—THE VICISSITUDES OF FLIGHT\n\n\nThis is what had taken place that same night at the La Force:—\n\nAn escape had been planned between Babet, Brujon, Guelemer, and\nThénardier, although Thénardier was in close confinement. Babet had\narranged the matter for his own benefit, on the same day, as the reader\nhas seen from Montparnasse’s account to Gavroche. Montparnasse was to\nhelp them from outside.\n\nBrujon, after having passed a month in the punishment cell, had had\ntime, in the first place, to weave a rope, in the second, to mature a\nplan. In former times, those severe places where the discipline of the\nprison delivers the convict into his own hands, were composed of four\nstone walls, a stone ceiling, a flagged pavement, a camp bed, a grated\nwindow, and a door lined with iron, and were called _dungeons_; but the\ndungeon was judged to be too terrible; nowadays they are composed of an\niron door, a grated window, a camp bed, a flagged pavement, four stone\nwalls, and a stone ceiling, and are called _chambers of punishment_. A\nlittle light penetrates towards midday. The inconvenient point about\nthese chambers which, as the reader sees, are not dungeons, is that\nthey allow the persons who should be at work to think.\n\nSo Brujon meditated, and he emerged from the chamber of punishment with\na rope. As he had the name of being very dangerous in the Charlemagne\ncourtyard, he was placed in the New Building. The first thing he found\nin the New Building was Guelemer, the second was a nail; Guelemer, that\nis to say, crime; a nail, that is to say, liberty. Brujon, of whom it\nis high time that the reader should have a complete idea, was, with an\nappearance of delicate health and a profoundly premeditated languor, a\npolished, intelligent sprig, and a thief, who had a caressing glance,\nand an atrocious smile. His glance resulted from his will, and his\nsmile from his nature. His first studies in his art had been directed\nto roofs. He had made great progress in the industry of the men who\ntear off lead, who plunder the roofs and despoil the gutters by the\nprocess called _double pickings_.\n\nThe circumstance which put the finishing touch on the moment peculiarly\nfavorable for an attempt at escape, was that the roofers were re-laying\nand re-jointing, at that very moment, a portion of the slates on the\nprison. The Saint-Bernard courtyard was no longer absolutely isolated\nfrom the Charlemagne and the Saint-Louis courts. Up above there were\nscaffoldings and ladders; in other words, bridges and stairs in the\ndirection of liberty.\n\nThe New Building, which was the most cracked and decrepit thing to be\nseen anywhere in the world, was the weak point in the prison. The walls\nwere eaten by saltpetre to such an extent that the authorities had been\nobliged to line the vaults of the dormitories with a sheathing of wood,\nbecause stones were in the habit of becoming detached and falling on\nthe prisoners in their beds. In spite of this antiquity, the\nauthorities committed the error of confining in the New Building the\nmost troublesome prisoners, of placing there “the hard cases,” as they\nsay in prison parlance.\n\nThe New Building contained four dormitories, one above the other, and a\ntop story which was called the Bel-Air (Fine-Air). A large\nchimney-flue, probably from some ancient kitchen of the Dukes de la\nForce, started from the ground floor, traversed all four stories, cut\nthe dormitories, where it figured as a flattened pillar, into two\nportions, and finally pierced the roof.\n\nGuelemer and Brujon were in the same dormitory. They had been placed,\nby way of precaution, on the lower story. Chance ordained that the\nheads of their beds should rest against the chimney.\n\nThénardier was directly over their heads in the top story known as\nFine-Air. The pedestrian who halts on the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine,\nafter passing the barracks of the firemen, in front of the\nporte-cochère of the bathing establishment, beholds a yard full of\nflowers and shrubs in wooden boxes, at the extremity of which spreads\nout a little white rotunda with two wings, brightened up with green\nshutters, the bucolic dream of Jean Jacques.\n\nNot more than ten years ago, there rose above that rotunda an enormous\nblack, hideous, bare wall by which it was backed up.\n\nThis was the outer wall of La Force.\n\nThis wall, beside that rotunda, was Milton viewed through Berquin.\n\nLofty as it was, this wall was overtopped by a still blacker roof,\nwhich could be seen beyond. This was the roof of the New Building.\nThere one could descry four dormer-windows, guarded with bars; they\nwere the windows of the Fine-Air.\n\nA chimney pierced the roof; this was the chimney which traversed the\ndormitories.\n\nThe Bel-Air, that top story of the New Building, was a sort of large\nhall, with a Mansard roof, guarded with triple gratings and double\ndoors of sheet iron, which were studded with enormous bolts. When one\nentered from the north end, one had on one’s left the four\ndormer-windows, on one’s right, facing the windows, at regular\nintervals, four square, tolerably vast cages, separated by narrow\npassages, built of masonry to about the height of the elbow, and the\nrest, up to the roof, of iron bars.\n\nThénardier had been in solitary confinement in one of these cages since\nthe night of the 3d of February. No one was ever able to discover how,\nand by what connivance, he succeeded in procuring, and secreting a\nbottle of wine, invented, so it is said, by Desrues, with which a\nnarcotic is mixed, and which the band of the _Endormeurs_, or\n_Sleep-compellers_, rendered famous.\n\nThere are, in many prisons, treacherous employees, half-jailers,\nhalf-thieves, who assist in escapes, who sell to the police an\nunfaithful service, and who turn a penny whenever they can.\n\nOn that same night, then, when Little Gavroche picked up the two lost\nchildren, Brujon and Guelemer, who knew that Babet, who had escaped\nthat morning, was waiting for them in the street as well as\nMontparnasse, rose softly, and with the nail which Brujon had found,\nbegan to pierce the chimney against which their beds stood. The rubbish\nfell on Brujon’s bed, so that they were not heard. Showers mingled with\nthunder shook the doors on their hinges, and created in the prison a\nterrible and opportune uproar. Those of the prisoners who woke,\npretended to fall asleep again, and left Guelemer and Brujon to their\nown devices. Brujon was adroit; Guelemer was vigorous. Before any sound\nhad reached the watcher, who was sleeping in the grated cell which\nopened into the dormitory, the wall had been pierced, the chimney\nscaled, the iron grating which barred the upper orifice of the flue\nforced, and the two redoubtable ruffians were on the roof. The wind and\nrain redoubled, the roof was slippery.\n\n“What a good night to leg it!” said Brujon.\n\nAn abyss six feet broad and eighty feet deep separated them from the\nsurrounding wall. At the bottom of this abyss, they could see the\nmusket of a sentinel gleaming through the gloom. They fastened one end\nof the rope which Brujon had spun in his dungeon to the stumps of the\niron bars which they had just wrenched off, flung the other over the\nouter wall, crossed the abyss at one bound, clung to the coping of the\nwall, got astride of it, let themselves slip, one after the other,\nalong the rope, upon a little roof which touches the bath-house, pulled\ntheir rope after them, jumped down into the courtyard of the\nbath-house, traversed it, pushed open the porter’s wicket, beside which\nhung his rope, pulled this, opened the porte-cochère, and found\nthemselves in the street.\n\nThree-quarters of an hour had not elapsed since they had risen in bed\nin the dark, nail in hand, and their project in their heads.\n\nA few moments later they had joined Babet and Montparnasse, who were\nprowling about the neighborhood.\n\nThey had broken their rope in pulling it after them, and a bit of it\nremained attached to the chimney on the roof. They had sustained no\nother damage, however, than that of scratching nearly all the skin off\ntheir hands.\n\nThat night, Thénardier was warned, without any one being able to\nexplain how, and was not asleep.\n\nTowards one o’clock in the morning, the night being very dark, he saw\ntwo shadows pass along the roof, in the rain and squalls, in front of\nthe dormer-window which was opposite his cage. One halted at the\nwindow, long enough to dart in a glance. This was Brujon.\n\nThénardier recognized him, and understood. This was enough.\n\nThénardier, rated as a burglar, and detained as a measure of precaution\nunder the charge of organizing a nocturnal ambush, with armed force,\nwas kept in sight. The sentry, who was relieved every two hours,\nmarched up and down in front of his cage with loaded musket. The\nFine-Air was lighted by a skylight. The prisoner had on his feet\nfetters weighing fifty pounds. Every day, at four o’clock in the\nafternoon, a jailer, escorted by two dogs,—this was still in vogue at\nthat time,—entered his cage, deposited beside his bed a loaf of black\nbread weighing two pounds, a jug of water, a bowl filled with rather\nthin bouillon, in which swam a few Mayagan beans, inspected his irons\nand tapped the bars. This man and his dogs made two visits during the\nnight.\n\nThénardier had obtained permission to keep a sort of iron bolt which he\nused to spike his bread into a crack in the wall, “in order to preserve\nit from the rats,” as he said. As Thénardier was kept in sight, no\nobjection had been made to this spike. Still, it was remembered\nafterwards, that one of the jailers had said: “It would be better to\nlet him have only a wooden spike.”\n\n\nAt two o’clock in the morning, the sentinel, who was an old soldier,\nwas relieved, and replaced by a conscript. A few moments later, the man\nwith the dogs paid his visit, and went off without noticing anything,\nexcept, possibly, the excessive youth and “the rustic air” of the “raw\nrecruit.” Two hours afterwards, at four o’clock, when they came to\nrelieve the conscript, he was found asleep on the floor, lying like a\nlog near Thénardier’s cage. As for Thénardier, he was no longer there.\nThere was a hole in the ceiling of his cage, and, above it, another\nhole in the roof. One of the planks of his bed had been wrenched off,\nand probably carried away with him, as it was not found. They also\nseized in his cell a half-empty bottle which contained the remains of\nthe stupefying wine with which the soldier had been drugged. The\nsoldier’s bayonet had disappeared.\n\nAt the moment when this discovery was made, it was assumed that\nThénardier was out of reach. The truth is, that he was no longer in the\nNew Building, but that he was still in great danger.\n\nThénardier, on reaching the roof of the New Building, had found the\nremains of Brujon’s rope hanging to the bars of the upper trap of the\nchimney, but, as this broken fragment was much too short, he had not\nbeen able to escape by the outer wall, as Brujon and Guelemer had done.\n\nWhen one turns from the Rue des Ballets into the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile,\none almost immediately encounters a repulsive ruin. There stood on that\nspot, in the last century, a house of which only the back wall now\nremains, a regular wall of masonry, which rises to the height of the\nthird story between the adjoining buildings. This ruin can be\nrecognized by two large square windows which are still to be seen\nthere; the middle one, that nearest the right gable, is barred with a\nworm-eaten beam adjusted like a prop. Through these windows there was\nformerly visible a lofty and lugubrious wall, which was a fragment of\nthe outer wall of La Force.\n\nThe empty space on the street left by the demolished house is\nhalf-filled by a fence of rotten boards, shored up by five stone posts.\nIn this recess lies concealed a little shanty which leans against the\nportion of the ruin which has remained standing. The fence has a gate,\nwhich, a few years ago, was fastened only by a latch.\n\nIt was the crest of this ruin that Thénardier had succeeded in\nreaching, a little after one o’clock in the morning.\n\nHow had he got there? That is what no one has ever been able to explain\nor understand. The lightning must, at the same time, have hindered and\nhelped him. Had he made use of the ladders and scaffoldings of the\nslaters to get from roof to roof, from enclosure to enclosure, from\ncompartment to compartment, to the buildings of the Charlemagne court,\nthen to the buildings of the Saint-Louis court, to the outer wall, and\nthence to the hut on the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile? But in that itinerary\nthere existed breaks which seemed to render it an impossibility. Had he\nplaced the plank from his bed like a bridge from the roof of the\nFine-Air to the outer wall, and crawled flat, on his belly on the\ncoping of the outer wall the whole distance round the prison as far as\nthe hut? But the outer wall of La Force formed a crenellated and\nunequal line; it mounted and descended, it dropped at the firemen’s\nbarracks, it rose towards the bath-house, it was cut in twain by\nbuildings, it was not even of the same height on the Hotel Lamoignon as\non the Rue Pavée; everywhere occurred falls and right angles; and then,\nthe sentinels must have espied the dark form of the fugitive; hence,\nthe route taken by Thénardier still remains rather inexplicable. In two\nmanners, flight was impossible. Had Thénardier, spurred on by that\nthirst for liberty which changes precipices into ditches, iron bars\ninto wattles of osier, a legless man into an athlete, a gouty man into\na bird, stupidity into instinct, instinct into intelligence, and\nintelligence into genius, had Thénardier invented a third mode? No one\nhas ever found out.\n\nThe marvels of escape cannot always be accounted for. The man who makes\nhis escape, we repeat, is inspired; there is something of the star and\nof the lightning in the mysterious gleam of flight; the effort towards\ndeliverance is no less surprising than the flight towards the sublime,\nand one says of the escaped thief: “How did he contrive to scale that\nwall?” in the same way that one says of Corneille: “Where did he find\n_the means of dying?_”\n\n\nAt all events, dripping with perspiration, drenched with rain, with his\nclothes hanging in ribbons, his hands flayed, his elbows bleeding, his\nknees torn, Thénardier had reached what children, in their figurative\nlanguage, call _the edge_ of the wall of the ruin, there he had\nstretched himself out at full length, and there his strength had failed\nhim. A steep escarpment three stories high separated him from the\npavement of the street.\n\nThe rope which he had was too short.\n\nThere he waited, pale, exhausted, desperate with all the despair which\nhe had undergone, still hidden by the night, but telling himself that\nthe day was on the point of dawning, alarmed at the idea of hearing the\nneighboring clock of Saint-Paul strike four within a few minutes, an\nhour when the sentinel was relieved and when the latter would be found\nasleep under the pierced roof, staring in horror at a terrible depth,\nat the light of the street lanterns, the wet, black pavement, that\npavement longed for yet frightful, which meant death, and which meant\nliberty.\n\nHe asked himself whether his three accomplices in flight had succeeded,\nif they had heard him, and if they would come to his assistance. He\nlistened. With the exception of the patrol, no one had passed through\nthe street since he had been there. Nearly the whole of the descent of\nthe market-gardeners from Montreuil, from Charonne, from Vincennes, and\nfrom Bercy to the markets was accomplished through the Rue\nSaint-Antoine.\n\nFour o’clock struck. Thénardier shuddered. A few moments later, that\nterrified and confused uproar which follows the discovery of an escape\nbroke forth in the prison. The sound of doors opening and shutting, the\ncreaking of gratings on their hinges, a tumult in the guard-house, the\nhoarse shouts of the turnkeys, the shock of musket-butts on the\npavement of the courts, reached his ears. Lights ascended and descended\npast the grated windows of the dormitories, a torch ran along the\nridge-pole of the top story of the New Building, the firemen belonging\nin the barracks on the right had been summoned. Their helmets, which\nthe torch lighted up in the rain, went and came along the roofs. At the\nsame time, Thénardier perceived in the direction of the Bastille a wan\nwhiteness lighting up the edge of the sky in doleful wise.\n\nHe was on top of a wall ten inches wide, stretched out under the heavy\nrains, with two gulfs to right and left, unable to stir, subject to the\ngiddiness of a possible fall, and to the horror of a certain arrest,\nand his thoughts, like the pendulum of a clock, swung from one of these\nideas to the other: “Dead if I fall, caught if I stay.” In the midst of\nthis anguish, he suddenly saw, the street being still dark, a man who\nwas gliding along the walls and coming from the Rue Pavée, halt in the\nrecess above which Thénardier was, as it were, suspended. Here this man\nwas joined by a second, who walked with the same caution, then by a\nthird, then by a fourth. When these men were re-united, one of them\nlifted the latch of the gate in the fence, and all four entered the\nenclosure in which the shanty stood. They halted directly under\nThénardier. These men had evidently chosen this vacant space in order\nthat they might consult without being seen by the passers-by or by the\nsentinel who guards the wicket of La Force a few paces distant. It must\nbe added, that the rain kept this sentinel blocked in his box.\nThénardier, not being able to distinguish their visages, lent an ear to\ntheir words with the desperate attention of a wretch who feels himself\nlost.\n\nThénardier saw something resembling a gleam of hope flash before his\neyes,—these men conversed in slang.\n\nThe first said in a low but distinct voice:—\n\n“Let’s cut. What are we up to here?”\n\n\nThe second replied: “It’s raining hard enough to put out the very\ndevil’s fire. And the bobbies will be along instanter. There’s a\nsoldier on guard yonder. We shall get nabbed here.”\n\n\nThese two words, _icigo_ and _icicaille_, both of which mean _ici_, and\nwhich belong, the first to the slang of the barriers, the second to the\nslang of the Temple, were flashes of light for Thénardier. By the\n_icigo_ he recognized Brujon, who was a prowler of the barriers, by the\n_icicaille_ he knew Babet, who, among his other trades, had been an\nold-clothes broker at the Temple.\n\nThe antique slang of the great century is no longer spoken except in\nthe Temple, and Babet was really the only person who spoke it in all\nits purity. Had it not been for the _icicaille_, Thénardier would not\nhave recognized him, for he had entirely changed his voice.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the third man had intervened.\n\n“There’s no hurry yet, let’s wait a bit. How do we know that he doesn’t\nstand in need of us?”\n\n\nBy this, which was nothing but French, Thénardier recognized\nMontparnasse, who made it a point in his elegance to understand all\nslangs and to speak none of them.\n\nAs for the fourth, he held his peace, but his huge shoulders betrayed\nhim. Thénardier did not hesitate. It was Guelemer.\n\nBrujon replied almost impetuously but still in a low tone:—\n\n“What are you jabbering about? The tavern-keeper hasn’t managed to cut\nhis stick. He don’t tumble to the racket, that he don’t! You have to be\na pretty knowing cove to tear up your shirt, cut up your sheet to make\na rope, punch holes in doors, get up false papers, make false keys,\nfile your irons, hang out your cord, hide yourself, and disguise\nyourself! The old fellow hasn’t managed to play it, he doesn’t\nunderstand how to work the business.”\n\n\nBabet added, still in that classical slang which was spoken by\nPoulailler and Cartouche, and which is to the bold, new, highly colored\nand risky argot used by Brujon what the language of Racine is to the\nlanguage of André Chenier:—\n\n“Your tavern-keeper must have been nabbed in the act. You have to be\nknowing. He’s only a greenhorn. He must have let himself be taken in by\na bobby, perhaps even by a sheep who played it on him as his pal.\nListen, Montparnasse, do you hear those shouts in the prison? You have\nseen all those lights. He’s recaptured, there! He’ll get off with\ntwenty years. I ain’t afraid, I ain’t a coward, but there ain’t\nanything more to do, or otherwise they’d lead us a dance. Don’t get\nmad, come with us, let’s go drink a bottle of old wine together.”\n\n\n“One doesn’t desert one’s friends in a scrape,” grumbled Montparnasse.\n\n“I tell you he’s nabbed!” retorted Brujon. “At the present moment, the\ninn-keeper ain’t worth a ha’penny. We can’t do nothing for him. Let’s\nbe off. Every minute I think a bobby has got me in his fist.”\n\n\nMontparnasse no longer offered more than a feeble resistance; the fact\nis, that these four men, with the fidelity of ruffians who never\nabandon each other, had prowled all night long about La Force, great as\nwas their peril, in the hope of seeing Thénardier make his appearance\non the top of some wall. But the night, which was really growing too\nfine,—for the downpour was such as to render all the streets\ndeserted,—the cold which was overpowering them, their soaked garments,\ntheir hole-ridden shoes, the alarming noise which had just burst forth\nin the prison, the hours which had elapsed, the patrol which they had\nencountered, the hope which was vanishing, all urged them to beat a\nretreat. Montparnasse himself, who was, perhaps, almost Thénardier’s\nson-in-law, yielded. A moment more, and they would be gone. Thénardier\nwas panting on his wall like the shipwrecked sufferers of the _Méduse_\non their raft when they beheld the vessel which had appeared in sight\nvanish on the horizon.\n\nHe dared not call to them; a cry might be heard and ruin everything. An\nidea occurred to him, a last idea, a flash of inspiration; he drew from\nhis pocket the end of Brujon’s rope, which he had detached from the\nchimney of the New Building, and flung it into the space enclosed by\nthe fence.\n\nThis rope fell at their feet.\n\n“A widow,\"37 said Babet.\n\n“My tortouse!”38 said Brujon.\n\n“The tavern-keeper is there,” said Montparnasse.\n\nThey raised their eyes. Thénardier thrust out his head a very little.\n\n“Quick!” said Montparnasse, “have you the other end of the rope,\nBrujon?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Knot the two pieces together, we’ll fling him the rope, he can fasten\nit to the wall, and he’ll have enough of it to get down with.”\n\n\nThénardier ran the risk, and spoke:—\n\n“I am paralyzed with cold.”\n\n\n“We’ll warm you up.”\n\n\n“I can’t budge.”\n\n\n“Let yourself slide, we’ll catch you.”\n\n\n“My hands are benumbed.”\n\n\n“Only fasten the rope to the wall.”\n\n\n“I can’t.”\n\n\n“Then one of us must climb up,” said Montparnasse.\n\n“Three stories!” ejaculated Brujon.\n\nAn ancient plaster flue, which had served for a stove that had been\nused in the shanty in former times, ran along the wall and mounted\nalmost to the very spot where they could see Thénardier. This flue,\nthen much damaged and full of cracks, has since fallen, but the marks\nof it are still visible.\n\nIt was very narrow.\n\n“One might get up by the help of that,” said Montparnasse.\n\n“By that flue?” exclaimed Babet, “a grown-up cove, never! it would take\na brat.”\n\n\n“A brat must be got,” resumed Brujon.\n\n“Where are we to find a young ‘un?” said Guelemer.\n\n“Wait,” said Montparnasse. “I’ve got the very article.”\n\n\nHe opened the gate of the fence very softly, made sure that no one was\npassing along the street, stepped out cautiously, shut the gate behind\nhim, and set off at a run in the direction of the Bastille.\n\nSeven or eight minutes elapsed, eight thousand centuries to Thénardier;\nBabet, Brujon, and Guelemer did not open their lips; at last the gate\nopened once more, and Montparnasse appeared, breathless, and followed\nby Gavroche. The rain still rendered the street completely deserted.\n\nLittle Gavroche entered the enclosure and gazed at the forms of these\nruffians with a tranquil air. The water was dripping from his hair.\nGuelemer addressed him:—\n\n“Are you a man, young ‘un?”\n\n\nGavroche shrugged his shoulders, and replied:—\n\n“A young ‘un like me’s a man, and men like you are babes.”\n\n\n“The brat’s tongue’s well hung!” exclaimed Babet.\n\n“The Paris brat ain’t made of straw,” added Brujon.\n\n“What do you want?” asked Gavroche.\n\nMontparnasse answered:—\n\n“Climb up that flue.”\n\n\n“With this rope,” said Babet.\n\n“And fasten it,” continued Brujon.\n\n“To the top of the wall,” went on Babet.\n\n“To the cross-bar of the window,” added Brujon.\n\n“And then?” said Gavroche.\n\n“There!” said Guelemer.\n\nThe gamin examined the rope, the flue, the wall, the windows, and made\nthat indescribable and disdainful noise with his lips which signifies:—\n\n“Is that all!”\n\n\n“There’s a man up there whom you are to save,” resumed Montparnasse.\n\n“Will you?” began Brujon again.\n\n“Greenhorn!” replied the lad, as though the question appeared a most\nunprecedented one to him.\n\nAnd he took off his shoes.\n\nGuelemer seized Gavroche by one arm, set him on the roof of the shanty,\nwhose worm-eaten planks bent beneath the urchin’s weight, and handed\nhim the rope which Brujon had knotted together during Montparnasse’s\nabsence. The gamin directed his steps towards the flue, which it was\neasy to enter, thanks to a large crack which touched the roof. At the\nmoment when he was on the point of ascending, Thénardier, who saw life\nand safety approaching, bent over the edge of the wall; the first light\nof dawn struck white upon his brow dripping with sweat, upon his livid\ncheek-bones, his sharp and savage nose, his bristling gray beard, and\nGavroche recognized him.\n\n“Hullo! it’s my father! Oh, that won’t hinder.”\n\n\nAnd taking the rope in his teeth, he resolutely began the ascent.\n\nHe reached the summit of the hut, bestrode the old wall as though it\nhad been a horse, and knotted the rope firmly to the upper cross-bar of\nthe window.\n\nA moment later, Thénardier was in the street.\n\nAs soon as he touched the pavement, as soon as he found himself out of\ndanger, he was no longer either weary, or chilled or trembling; the\nterrible things from which he had escaped vanished like smoke, all that\nstrange and ferocious mind awoke once more, and stood erect and free,\nready to march onward.\n\nThese were this man’s first words:—\n\n“Now, whom are we to eat?”\n\n\nIt is useless to explain the sense of this frightfully transparent\nremark, which signifies both to kill, to assassinate, and to plunder.\n_To eat_, true sense: _to devour_.\n\n“Let’s get well into a corner,” said Brujon. “Let’s settle it in three\nwords, and part at once. There was an affair that promised well in the\nRue Plumet, a deserted street, an isolated house, an old rotten gate on\na garden, and lone women.”\n\n\n“Well! why not?” demanded Thénardier.\n\n“Your girl, Éponine, went to see about the matter,” replied Babet.\n\n“And she brought a biscuit to Magnon,” added Guelemer. “Nothing to be\nmade there.”\n\n\n“The girl’s no fool,” said Thénardier. “Still, it must be seen to.”\n\n\n“Yes, yes,” said Brujon, “it must be looked up.”\n\n\nIn the meanwhile, none of the men seemed to see Gavroche, who, during\nthis colloquy, had seated himself on one of the fence-posts; he waited\na few moments, thinking that perhaps his father would turn towards him,\nthen he put on his shoes again, and said:—\n\n“Is that all? You don’t want any more, my men? Now you’re out of your\nscrape. I’m off. I must go and get my brats out of bed.”\n\n\nAnd off he went.\n\nThe five men emerged, one after another, from the enclosure.\n\nWhen Gavroche had disappeared at the corner of the Rue des Ballets,\nBabet took Thénardier aside.\n\n“Did you take a good look at that young ‘un?” he asked.\n\n“What young ‘un?”\n\n\n“The one who climbed the wall and carried you the rope.”\n\n\n“Not particularly.”\n\n\n“Well, I don’t know, but it strikes me that it was your son.”\n\n\n“Bah!” said Thénardier, “do you think so?”\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SEVENTH—SLANG\n\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nSlang B7-1-slang\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—ORIGIN\n\n\n_Pigritia_ is a terrible word.\n\nIt engenders a whole world, _la pègre_, for which read _theft_, and a\nhell, _la pègrenne_, for which read _hunger_.\n\nThus, idleness is the mother.\n\nShe has a son, theft, and a daughter, hunger.\n\nWhere are we at this moment? In the land of slang.\n\nWhat is slang? It is at one and the same time, a nation and a dialect;\nit is theft in its two kinds; people and language.\n\nWhen, four and thirty years ago, the narrator of this grave and sombre\nhistory introduced into a work written with the same aim as this39 a\nthief who talked argot, there arose amazement and clamor.—“What! How!\nArgot! Why, argot is horrible! It is the language of prisons, galleys,\nconvicts, of everything that is most abominable in society!” etc., etc.\n\nWe have never understood this sort of objections.\n\nSince that time, two powerful romancers, one of whom is a profound\nobserver of the human heart, the other an intrepid friend of the\npeople, Balzac and Eugène Sue, having represented their ruffians as\ntalking their natural language, as the author of _The Last Day of a\nCondemned Man_ did in 1828, the same objections have been raised.\nPeople repeated: “What do authors mean by that revolting dialect? Slang\nis odious! Slang makes one shudder!”\n\n\nWho denies that? Of course it does.\n\nWhen it is a question of probing a wound, a gulf, a society, since when\nhas it been considered wrong to go too far? to go to the bottom? We\nhave always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act, and, at\nleast, a simple and useful deed, worthy of the sympathetic attention\nwhich duty accepted and fulfilled merits. Why should one not explore\neverything, and study everything? Why should one halt on the way? The\nhalt is a matter depending on the sounding-line, and not on the\nleadsman.\n\nCertainly, too, it is neither an attractive nor an easy task to\nundertake an investigation into the lowest depths of the social order,\nwhere terra firma comes to an end and where mud begins, to rummage in\nthose vague, murky waves, to follow up, to seize and to fling, still\nquivering, upon the pavement that abject dialect which is dripping with\nfilth when thus brought to the light, that pustulous vocabulary each\nword of which seems an unclean ring from a monster of the mire and the\nshadows. Nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its\nnudity, in the broad light of thought, of the horrible swarming of\nslang. It seems, in fact, to be a sort of horrible beast made for the\nnight which has just been torn from its cesspool. One thinks one\nbeholds a frightful, living, and bristling thicket which quivers,\nrustles, wavers, returns to shadow, threatens and glares. One word\nresembles a claw, another an extinguished and bleeding eye, such and\nsuch a phrase seems to move like the claw of a crab. All this is alive\nwith the hideous vitality of things which have been organized out of\ndisorganization.\n\nNow, when has horror ever excluded study? Since when has malady\nbanished medicine? Can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the\nviper, the bat, the scorpion, the centipede, the tarantula, and one who\nwould cast them back into their darkness, saying: “Oh! how ugly that\nis!” The thinker who should turn aside from slang would resemble a\nsurgeon who should avert his face from an ulcer or a wart. He would be\nlike a philologist refusing to examine a fact in language, a\nphilosopher hesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity. For, it must\nbe stated to those who are ignorant of the case, that argot is both a\nliterary phenomenon and a social result. What is slang, properly\nspeaking? It is the language of wretchedness.\n\nWe may be stopped; the fact may be put to us in general terms, which is\none way of attenuating it; we may be told, that all trades,\nprofessions, it may be added, all the accidents of the social hierarchy\nand all forms of intelligence, have their own slang. The merchant who\nsays: “Montpellier not active, Marseilles fine quality,” the broker on\n‘change who says: “Assets at end of current month,” the gambler who\nsays: _“Tiers et tout, refait de pique,”_ the sheriff of the Norman\nIsles who says: “The holder in fee reverting to his landed estate\ncannot claim the fruits of that estate during the hereditary seizure of\nthe real estate by the mortgagor,” the playwright who says: “The piece\nwas hissed,” the comedian who says: “I’ve made a hit,” the philosopher\nwho says: “Phenomenal triplicity,” the huntsman who says: _“Voileci\nallais, Voileci fuyant,”_ the phrenologist who says: “Amativeness,\ncombativeness, secretiveness,” the infantry soldier who says: “My\nshooting-iron,” the cavalry-man who says: “My turkey-cock,” the\nfencing-master who says: “Tierce, quarte, break,” the printer who says:\n“My shooting-stick and galley,”—all, printer, fencing-master, cavalry\ndragoon, infantry-man, phrenologist, huntsman, philosopher, comedian,\nplaywright, sheriff, gambler, stock-broker, and merchant, speak slang.\nThe painter who says: “My grinder,” the notary who says: “My\nSkip-the-Gutter,” the hairdresser who says: “My mealyback,” the cobbler\nwho says: “My cub,” talks slang. Strictly speaking, if one absolutely\ninsists on the point, all the different fashions of saying the right\nand the left, the sailor’s _port_ and _starboard_, the scene-shifter’s\n_court-side_, and _garden-side_, the beadle’s _Gospel-side_ and\n_Epistle-side_, are slang. There is the slang of the affected lady as\nwell as of the _précieuses_. The Hotel Rambouillet nearly adjoins the\nCour des Miracles. There is a slang of duchesses, witness this phrase\ncontained in a love-letter from a very great lady and a very pretty\nwoman of the Restoration: “You will find in this gossip a fultitude of\nreasons why I should libertize.\"40 Diplomatic ciphers are slang; the\npontifical chancellery by using 26 for Rome, _grkztntgzyal_ for\ndespatch, and _abfxustgrnogrkzu tu XI_. for the Duc de Modena, speaks\nslang. The physicians of the Middle Ages who, for carrot, radish, and\nturnip, said _Opoponach, perfroschinum, reptitalmus, dracatholicum,\nangelorum, postmegorum_, talked slang. The sugar-manufacturer who says:\n“Loaf, clarified, lumps, bastard, common, burnt,”—this honest\nmanufacturer talks slang. A certain school of criticism twenty years\nago, which used to say: “Half of the works of Shakespeare consists of\nplays upon words and puns,”—talked slang. The poet, and the artist who,\nwith profound understanding, would designate M. de Montmorency as “a\nbourgeois,” if he were not a judge of verses and statues, speak slang.\nThe classic Academician who calls flowers “Flora,” fruits, “Pomona,”\nthe sea, “Neptune,” love, “fires,” beauty, “charms,” a horse, “a\ncourser,” the white or tricolored cockade, “the rose of Bellona,” the\nthree-cornered hat, “Mars’ triangle,”—that classical Academician talks\nslang. Algebra, medicine, botany, have each their slang. The tongue\nwhich is employed on board ship, that wonderful language of the sea,\nwhich is so complete and so picturesque, which was spoken by Jean Bart,\nDuquesne, Suffren, and Duperré, which mingles with the whistling of the\nrigging, the sound of the speaking-trumpets, the shock of the\nboarding-irons, the roll of the sea, the wind, the gale, the cannon, is\nwholly a heroic and dazzling slang, which is to the fierce slang of the\nthieves what the lion is to the jackal.\n\nNo doubt. But say what we will, this manner of understanding the word\n_slang_ is an extension which every one will not admit. For our part,\nwe reserve to the word its ancient and precise, circumscribed and\ndetermined significance, and we restrict slang to slang. The veritable\nslang and the slang that is pre-eminently slang, if the two words can\nbe coupled thus, the slang immemorial which was a kingdom, is nothing\nelse, we repeat, than the homely, uneasy, crafty, treacherous,\nvenomous, cruel, equivocal, vile, profound, fatal tongue of\nwretchedness. There exists, at the extremity of all abasement and all\nmisfortunes, a last misery which revolts and makes up its mind to enter\ninto conflict with the whole mass of fortunate facts and reigning\nrights; a fearful conflict, where, now cunning, now violent, unhealthy\nand ferocious at one and the same time, it attacks the social order\nwith pin-pricks through vice, and with club-blows through crime. To\nmeet the needs of this conflict, wretchedness has invented a language\nof combat, which is slang.\n\nTo keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion, to hold above the gulf,\nwere it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which\nwould, otherwise, be lost, that is to say, one of the elements, good or\nbad, of which civilization is composed, or by which it is complicated,\nto extend the records of social observation; is to serve civilization\nitself. This service Plautus rendered, consciously or unconsciously, by\nmaking two Carthaginian soldiers talk Phœnician; that service Molière\nrendered, by making so many of his characters talk Levantine and all\nsorts of dialects. Here objections spring up afresh. Phœnician, very\ngood! Levantine, quite right! Even dialect, let that pass! They are\ntongues which have belonged to nations or provinces; but slang! What is\nthe use of preserving slang? What is the good of assisting slang “to\nsurvive”?\n\nTo this we reply in one word, only. Assuredly, if the tongue which a\nnation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest, the language\nwhich has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and\nstudy.\n\nIt is the language which has been spoken, in France, for example, for\nmore than four centuries, not only by a misery, but by every possible\nhuman misery.\n\nAnd then, we insist upon it, the study of social deformities and\ninfirmities, and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy,\nis not a business in which choice is permitted. The historian of\nmanners and ideas has no less austere a mission than the historian of\nevents. The latter has the surface of civilization, the conflicts of\ncrowns, the births of princes, the marriages of kings, battles,\nassemblages, great public men, revolutions in the daylight, everything\non the exterior; the other historian has the interior, the depths, the\npeople who toil, suffer, wait, the oppressed woman, the agonizing\nchild, the secret war between man and man, obscure ferocities,\nprejudices, plotted iniquities, the subterranean, the indistinct\ntremors of multitudes, the die-of-hunger, the counter-blows of the law,\nthe secret evolution of souls, the go-bare-foot, the bare-armed, the\ndisinherited, the orphans, the unhappy, and the infamous, all the forms\nwhich roam through the darkness. He must descend with his heart full of\ncharity, and severity at the same time, as a brother and as a judge, to\nthose impenetrable casemates where crawl, pell-mell, those who bleed\nand those who deal the blow, those who weep and those who curse, those\nwho fast and those who devour, those who endure evil and those who\ninflict it. Have these historians of hearts and souls duties at all\ninferior to the historians of external facts? Does any one think that\nAlighieri has any fewer things to say than Machiavelli? Is the under\nside of civilization any less important than the upper side merely\nbecause it is deeper and more sombre? Do we really know the mountain\nwell when we are not acquainted with the cavern?\n\nLet us say, moreover, parenthetically, that from a few words of what\nprecedes a marked separation might be inferred between the two classes\nof historians which does not exist in our mind. No one is a good\nhistorian of the patent, visible, striking, and public life of peoples,\nif he is not, at the same time, in a certain measure, the historian of\ntheir deep and hidden life; and no one is a good historian of the\ninterior unless he understands how, at need, to be the historian of the\nexterior also. The history of manners and ideas permeates the history\nof events, and this is true reciprocally. They constitute two different\norders of facts which correspond to each other, which are always\ninterlaced, and which often bring forth results. All the lineaments\nwhich providence traces on the surface of a nation have their\nparallels, sombre but distinct, in their depths, and all convulsions of\nthe depths produce ebullitions on the surface. True history being a\nmixture of all things, the true historian mingles in everything.\n\nMan is not a circle with a single centre; he is an ellipse with a\ndouble focus. Facts form one of these, and ideas the other.\n\nSlang is nothing but a dressing-room where the tongue having some bad\naction to perform, disguises itself. There it clothes itself in\nword-masks, in metaphor-rags. In this guise it becomes horrible.\n\nOne finds it difficult to recognize. Is it really the French tongue,\nthe great human tongue? Behold it ready to step upon the stage and to\nretort upon crime, and prepared for all the employments of the\nrepertory of evil. It no longer walks, it hobbles; it limps on the\ncrutch of the Court of Miracles, a crutch metamorphosable into a club;\nit is called vagrancy; every sort of spectre, its dressers, have\npainted its face, it crawls and rears, the double gait of the reptile.\nHenceforth, it is apt at all rôles, it is made suspicious by the\ncounterfeiter, covered with verdigris by the forger, blacked by the\nsoot of the incendiary; and the murderer applies its rouge.\n\nWhen one listens, by the side of honest men, at the portals of society,\none overhears the dialogues of those who are on the outside. One\ndistinguishes questions and replies. One perceives, without\nunderstanding it, a hideous murmur, sounding almost like human accents,\nbut more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word. It is slang.\nThe words are misshapen and stamped with an indescribable and fantastic\nbestiality. One thinks one hears hydras talking.\n\nIt is unintelligible in the dark. It gnashes and whispers, completing\nthe gloom with mystery. It is black in misfortune, it is blacker still\nin crime; these two blacknesses amalgamated, compose slang. Obscurity\nin the atmosphere, obscurity in acts, obscurity in voices. Terrible,\ntoad-like tongue which goes and comes, leaps, crawls, slobbers, and\nstirs about in monstrous wise in that immense gray fog composed of rain\nand night, of hunger, of vice, of falsehood, of injustice, of nudity,\nof suffocation, and of winter, the high noonday of the miserable.\n\nLet us have compassion on the chastised. Alas! Who are we ourselves?\nWho am I who now address you? Who are you who are listening to me? And\nare you very sure that we have done nothing before we were born? The\nearth is not devoid of resemblance to a jail. Who knows whether man is\nnot a recaptured offender against divine justice? Look closely at life.\nIt is so made, that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment.\n\nAre you what is called a happy man? Well! you are sad every day. Each\nday has its own great grief or its little care. Yesterday you were\ntrembling for a health that is dear to you, to-day you fear for your\nown; to-morrow it will be anxiety about money, the day after to-morrow\nthe diatribe of a slanderer, the day after that, the misfortune of some\nfriend; then the prevailing weather, then something that has been\nbroken or lost, then a pleasure with which your conscience and your\nvertebral column reproach you; again, the course of public affairs.\nThis without reckoning in the pains of the heart. And so it goes on.\nOne cloud is dispelled, another forms. There is hardly one day out of a\nhundred which is wholly joyous and sunny. And you belong to that small\nclass who are happy! As for the rest of mankind, stagnating night rests\nupon them.\n\nThoughtful minds make but little use of the phrase: the fortunate and\nthe unfortunate. In this world, evidently the vestibule of another,\nthere are no fortunate.\n\nThe real human division is this: the luminous and the shady. To\ndiminish the number of the shady, to augment the number of the\nluminous,—that is the object. That is why we cry: Education! science!\nTo teach reading, means to light the fire; every syllable spelled out\nsparkles.\n\nHowever, he who says light does not, necessarily, say joy. People\nsuffer in the light; excess burns. The flame is the enemy of the wing.\nTo burn without ceasing to fly,—therein lies the marvel of genius.\n\nWhen you shall have learned to know, and to love, you will still\nsuffer. The day is born in tears. The luminous weep, if only over those\nin darkness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—ROOTS\n\n\nSlang is the tongue of those who sit in darkness.\n\nThought is moved in its most sombre depths, social philosophy is bidden\nto its most poignant meditations, in the presence of that enigmatic\ndialect at once so blighted and rebellious. Therein lies chastisement\nmade visible. Every syllable has an air of being marked. The words of\nthe vulgar tongue appear therein wrinkled and shrivelled, as it were,\nbeneath the hot iron of the executioner. Some seem to be still smoking.\nSuch and such a phrase produces upon you the effect of the shoulder of\na thief branded with the fleur-de-lys, which has suddenly been laid\nbare. Ideas almost refuse to be expressed in these substantives which\nare fugitives from justice. Metaphor is sometimes so shameless, that\none feels that it has worn the iron neck-fetter.\n\nMoreover, in spite of all this, and because of all this, this strange\ndialect has by rights, its own compartment in that great impartial case\nof pigeon-holes where there is room for the rusty farthing as well as\nfor the gold medal, and which is called literature. Slang, whether the\npublic admit the fact or not has its syntax and its poetry. It is a\nlanguage. Yes, by the deformity of certain terms, we recognize the fact\nthat it was chewed by Mandrin, and by the splendor of certain\nmetonymies, we feel that Villon spoke it.\n\nThat exquisite and celebrated verse—\n\nMais où sont les neiges d’antan?\nBut where are the snows of years gone by?\n\n\nis a verse of slang. _Antan—ante annum_—is a word of Thunes slang,\nwhich signified the past year, and by extension, _formerly_.\nThirty-five years ago, at the epoch of the departure of the great\nchain-gang, there could be read in one of the cells at Bicêtre, this\nmaxim engraved with a nail on the wall by a king of Thunes condemned to\nthe galleys: _Les dabs d’antan trimaient siempre pour la pierre du\nCoësre_. This means _Kings in days gone by always went and had\nthemselves anointed_. In the opinion of that king, anointment meant the\ngalleys.\n\nThe word _décarade_, which expresses the departure of heavy vehicles at\na gallop, is attributed to Villon, and it is worthy of him. This word,\nwhich strikes fire with all four of its feet, sums up in a masterly\nonomatopœia the whole of La Fontaine’s admirable verse:—\n\nSix forts chevaux tiraient un coche.\nSix stout horses drew a coach.\n\n\nFrom a purely literary point of view, few studies would prove more\ncurious and fruitful than the study of slang. It is a whole language\nwithin a language, a sort of sickly excrescence, an unhealthy graft\nwhich has produced a vegetation, a parasite which has its roots in the\nold Gallic trunk, and whose sinister foliage crawls all over one side\nof the language. This is what may be called the first, the vulgar\naspect of slang. But, for those who study the tongue as it should be\nstudied, that is to say, as geologists study the earth, slang appears\nlike a veritable alluvial deposit. According as one digs a longer or\nshorter distance into it, one finds in slang, below the old popular\nFrench, Provençal, Spanish, Italian, Levantine, that language of the\nMediterranean ports, English and German, the Romance language in its\nthree varieties, French, Italian, and Romance Romance, Latin, and\nfinally Basque and Celtic. A profound and unique formation. A\nsubterranean edifice erected in common by all the miserable. Each\naccursed race has deposited its layer, each suffering has dropped its\nstone there, each heart has contributed its pebble. A throng of evil,\nbase, or irritated souls, who have traversed life and have vanished\ninto eternity, linger there almost entirely visible still beneath the\nform of some monstrous word.\n\nDo you want Spanish? The old Gothic slang abounded in it. Here is\n_boffete_, a box on the ear, which is derived from _bofeton; vantane_,\nwindow (later on _vanterne_), which comes from _vantana; gat_, cat,\nwhich comes from _gato; acite_, oil, which comes from _aceyte_. Do you\nwant Italian? Here is _spade_, sword, which comes from _spada; carvel_,\nboat, which comes from _caravella_. Do you want English? Here is\n_bichot_, which comes from _bishop; raille_, spy, which comes from\n_rascal, rascalion; pilche_, a case, which comes from _pilcher_, a\nsheath. Do you want German? Here is the _caleur_, the waiter,\n_kellner_; the _hers_, the master, _herzog_ (duke). Do you want Latin?\nHere is _frangir_, to break, _frangere; affurer_, to steal, _fur;\ncadene_, chain, _catena_. There is one word which crops up in every\nlanguage of the continent, with a sort of mysterious power and\nauthority. It is the word _magnus_; the Scotchman makes of it his\n_mac_, which designates the chief of the clan; Mac-Farlane,\nMac-Callumore, the great Farlane, the great Callumore41; slang turns it\ninto _meck_ and later _le meg_, that is to say, God. Would you like\nBasque? Here is _gahisto_, the devil, which comes from _gaïztoa_, evil;\n_sorgabon_, good night, which comes from _gabon_, good evening. Do you\nwant Celtic? Here is _blavin_, a handkerchief, which comes from\n_blavet_, gushing water; _ménesse_, a woman (in a bad sense), which\ncomes from _meinec_, full of stones; _barant_, brook, from _baranton_,\nfountain; _goffeur_, locksmith, from _goff_, blacksmith; _guedouze_,\ndeath, which comes from _guenn-du_, black-white. Finally, would you\nlike history? Slang calls crowns _les maltèses_, a souvenir of the coin\nin circulation on the galleys of Malta.\n\nIn addition to the philological origins just indicated, slang possesses\nother and still more natural roots, which spring, so to speak, from the\nmind of man itself.\n\nIn the first place, the direct creation of words. Therein lies the\nmystery of tongues. To paint with words, which contains figures one\nknows not how or why, is the primitive foundation of all human\nlanguages, what may be called their granite.\n\nSlang abounds in words of this description, immediate words, words\ncreated instantaneously no one knows either where or by whom, without\netymology, without analogies, without derivatives, solitary, barbarous,\nsometimes hideous words, which at times possess a singular power of\nexpression and which live. The executioner, _le taule_; the forest, _le\nsabri_; fear, flight, _taf_; the lackey, _le larbin_; the mineral, the\nprefect, the minister, _pharos_; the devil, _le rabouin_. Nothing is\nstranger than these words which both mask and reveal. Some, _le\nrabouin_, for example, are at the same time grotesque and terrible, and\nproduce on you the effect of a cyclopean grimace.\n\nIn the second place, metaphor. The peculiarity of a language which is\ndesirous of saying all yet concealing all is that it is rich in\nfigures. Metaphor is an enigma, wherein the thief who is plotting a\nstroke, the prisoner who is arranging an escape, take refuge. No idiom\nis more metaphorical than slang: _dévisser le coco_ (to unscrew the\nnut), to twist the neck; _tortiller_ (to wriggle), to eat; _être\ngerbé_, to be tried; _a rat_, a bread thief; _il lansquine_, it rains,\na striking, ancient figure which partly bears its date about it, which\nassimilates long oblique lines of rain, with the dense and slanting\npikes of the lancers, and which compresses into a single word the\npopular expression: it rains halberds. Sometimes, in proportion as\nslang progresses from the first epoch to the second, words pass from\nthe primitive and savage sense to the metaphorical sense. The devil\nceases to be _le rabouin_, and becomes _le boulanger_ (the baker), who\nputs the bread into the oven. This is more witty, but less grand,\nsomething like Racine after Corneille, like Euripides after Æschylus.\nCertain slang phrases which participate in the two epochs and have at\nonce the barbaric character and the metaphorical character resemble\nphantasmagories. _Les sorgueuers vont solliciter des gails à la\nlune_—the prowlers are going to steal horses by night,—this passes\nbefore the mind like a group of spectres. One knows not what one sees.\n\nIn the third place, the expedient. Slang lives on the language. It uses\nit in accordance with its fancy, it dips into it hap-hazard, and it\noften confines itself, when occasion arises, to alter it in a gross and\nsummary fashion. Occasionally, with the ordinary words thus deformed\nand complicated with words of pure slang, picturesque phrases are\nformed, in which there can be felt the mixture of the two preceding\nelements, the direct creation and the metaphor: _le cab jaspine, je\nmarronne que la roulotte de Pantin trime dans le sabri_, the dog is\nbarking, I suspect that the diligence for Paris is passing through the\nwoods. _Le dab est sinve, la dabuge est merloussière, la fée est\nbative_, the bourgeois is stupid, the bourgeoise is cunning, the\ndaughter is pretty. Generally, to throw listeners off the track, slang\nconfines itself to adding to all the words of the language without\ndistinction, an ignoble tail, a termination in _aille_, in _orgue_, in\n_iergue_, or in _uche_. Thus: _Vousiergue trouvaille bonorgue ce\ngigotmuche?_ Do you think that leg of mutton good? A phrase addressed\nby Cartouche to a turnkey in order to find out whether the sum offered\nfor his escape suited him.\n\nThe termination in _mar_ has been added recently.\n\nSlang, being the dialect of corruption, quickly becomes corrupted\nitself. Besides this, as it is always seeking concealment, as soon as\nit feels that it is understood, it changes its form. Contrary to what\nhappens with every other vegetation, every ray of light which falls\nupon it kills whatever it touches. Thus slang is in constant process of\ndecomposition and recomposition; an obscure and rapid work which never\npauses. It passes over more ground in ten years than a language in ten\ncenturies. Thus _le larton_ (bread) becomes _le lartif; le gail_\n(horse) becomes _le gaye; la fertanche_ (straw) becomes _la fertille;\nle momignard_ (brat), _le momacque; les fiques_ (duds), _frusques; la\nchique_ (the church), _l‘égrugeoir; le colabre_ (neck), _le colas_. The\ndevil is at first, _gahisto_, then _le rabouin_, then _the baker_; the\npriest is a _ratichon_, then the boar (_le sanglier_); the dagger is\n_le vingt-deux_ (twenty-two), then _le surin_, then _le lingre_; the\npolice are _railles_, then _roussins_, then _rousses_, then _marchands\nde lacets_ (dealers in stay-laces), then _coquers_, then _cognes_; the\nexecutioner is _le taule_, then _Charlot, l’atigeur_, then _le\nbecquillard_. In the seventeenth century, to fight was “to give each\nother snuff”; in the nineteenth it is “to chew each other’s throats.”\nThere have been twenty different phrases between these two extremes.\nCartouche’s talk would have been Hebrew to Lacenaire. All the words of\nthis language are perpetually engaged in flight like the men who utter\nthem.\n\nStill, from time to time, and in consequence of this very movement, the\nancient slang crops up again and becomes new once more. It has its\nheadquarters where it maintains its sway. The Temple preserved the\nslang of the seventeenth century; Bicêtre, when it was a prison,\npreserved the slang of Thunes. There one could hear the termination in\n_anche_ of the old Thuneurs. _Boyanches-tu_ (bois-tu), do you drink?\nBut perpetual movement remains its law, nevertheless.\n\nIf the philosopher succeeds in fixing, for a moment, for purposes of\nobservation, this language which is incessantly evaporating, he falls\ninto doleful and useful meditation. No study is more efficacious and\nmore fecund in instruction. There is not a metaphor, not an analogy, in\nslang, which does not contain a lesson. Among these men, to beat means\nto feign; one beats a malady; ruse is their strength.\n\nFor them, the idea of the man is not separated from the idea of\ndarkness. The night is called _la sorgue_; man, _l’orgue_. Man is a\nderivative of the night.\n\nThey have taken up the practice of considering society in the light of\nan atmosphere which kills them, of a fatal force, and they speak of\ntheir liberty as one would speak of his health. A man under arrest is a\n_sick man_; one who is condemned is a _dead man_.\n\nThe most terrible thing for the prisoner within the four walls in which\nhe is buried, is a sort of glacial chastity, and he calls the dungeon\nthe _castus_. In that funereal place, life outside always presents\nitself under its most smiling aspect. The prisoner has irons on his\nfeet; you think, perhaps, that his thought is that it is with the feet\nthat one walks? No; he is thinking that it is with the feet that one\ndances; so, when he has succeeded in severing his fetters, his first\nidea is that now he can dance, and he calls the saw the _bastringue_\n(public-house ball).—A name is a centre; profound assimilation.—The\nruffian has two heads, one of which reasons out his actions and leads\nhim all his life long, and the other which he has upon his shoulders on\nthe day of his death; he calls the head which counsels him in crime _la\nsorbonne_, and the head which expiates it _la tronche_.—When a man has\nno longer anything but rags upon his body and vices in his heart, when\nhe has arrived at that double moral and material degradation which the\nword blackguard characterizes in its two acceptations, he is ripe for\ncrime; he is like a well-whetted knife; he has two cutting edges, his\ndistress and his malice; so slang does not say a blackguard, it says\n_un réguisé_.—What are the galleys? A brazier of damnation, a hell. The\nconvict calls himself a _fagot_.—And finally, what name do malefactors\ngive to their prison? The _college_. A whole penitentiary system can be\nevolved from that word.\n\nDoes the reader wish to know where the majority of the songs of the\ngalleys, those refrains called in the special vocabulary _lirlonfa_,\nhave had their birth?\n\nLet him listen to what follows:—\n\nThere existed at the Châtelet in Paris a large and long cellar. This\ncellar was eight feet below the level of the Seine. It had neither\nwindows nor air-holes, its only aperture was the door; men could enter\nthere, air could not. This vault had for ceiling a vault of stone, and\nfor floor ten inches of mud. It was flagged; but the pavement had\nrotted and cracked under the oozing of the water. Eight feet above the\nfloor, a long and massive beam traversed this subterranean excavation\nfrom side to side; from this beam hung, at short distances apart,\nchains three feet long, and at the end of these chains there were rings\nfor the neck. In this vault, men who had been condemned to the galleys\nwere incarcerated until the day of their departure for Toulon. They\nwere thrust under this beam, where each one found his fetters swinging\nin the darkness and waiting for him.\n\nThe chains, those pendant arms, and the necklets, those open hands,\ncaught the unhappy wretches by the throat. They were rivetted and left\nthere. As the chain was too short, they could not lie down. They\nremained motionless in that cavern, in that night, beneath that beam,\nalmost hanging, forced to unheard-of efforts to reach their bread, jug,\nor their vault overhead, mud even to mid-leg, filth flowing to their\nvery calves, broken asunder with fatigue, with thighs and knees giving\nway, clinging fast to the chain with their hands in order to obtain\nsome rest, unable to sleep except when standing erect, and awakened\nevery moment by the strangling of the collar; some woke no more. In\norder to eat, they pushed the bread, which was flung to them in the\nmud, along their leg with their heel until it reached their hand.\n\nHow long did they remain thus? One month, two months, six months\nsometimes; one stayed a year. It was the antechamber of the galleys.\nMen were put there for stealing a hare from the king. In this\nsepulchre-hell, what did they do? What man can do in a sepulchre, they\nwent through the agonies of death, and what can man do in hell, they\nsang; for song lingers where there is no longer any hope. In the waters\nof Malta, when a galley was approaching, the song could be heard before\nthe sound of the oars. Poor Survincent, the poacher, who had gone\nthrough the prison-cellar of the Châtelet, said: “It was the rhymes\nthat kept me up.” Uselessness of poetry. What is the good of rhyme?\n\nIt is in this cellar that nearly all the slang songs had their birth.\nIt is from the dungeon of the Grand-Châtelet of Paris that comes the\nmelancholy refrain of the Montgomery galley: _“Timaloumisaine,\ntimaloumison.”_ The majority of these songs are melancholy; some are\ngay; one is tender:—\n\nIcicaille est la theatre        Here is the theatre\nDu petit dardant.               Of the little archer (Cupid).\n\n\nDo what you will, you cannot annihilate that eternal relic in the heart\nof man, love.\n\nIn this world of dismal deeds, people keep their secrets. The secret is\nthe thing above all others. The secret, in the eyes of these wretches,\nis unity which serves as a base of union. To betray a secret is to tear\nfrom each member of this fierce community something of his own\npersonality. To inform against, in the energetic slang dialect, is\ncalled: “to eat the bit.” As though the informer drew to himself a\nlittle of the substance of all and nourished himself on a bit of each\none’s flesh.\n\nWhat does it signify to receive a box on the ear? Commonplace metaphor\nreplies: “It is to see thirty-six candles.” Here slang intervenes and\ntakes it up: Candle, _camoufle_. Thereupon, the ordinary tongue gives\n_camouflet_42 as the synonym for _soufflet_. Thus, by a sort of\ninfiltration from below upwards, with the aid of metaphor, that\nincalculable, trajectory slang mounts from the cavern to the Academy;\nand Poulailler saying: “I light my _camoufle_,” causes Voltaire to\nwrite: “Langleviel La Beaumelle deserves a hundred _camouflets_.”\n\n\nResearches in slang mean discoveries at every step. Study and\ninvestigation of this strange idiom lead to the mysterious point of\nintersection of regular society with society which is accursed.\n\nThe thief also has his food for cannon, stealable matter, you, I,\nwhoever passes by; _le pantre_. (_Pan_, everybody.)\n\nSlang is language turned convict.\n\nThat the thinking principle of man be thrust down ever so low, that it\ncan be dragged and pinioned there by obscure tyrannies of fatality,\nthat it can be bound by no one knows what fetters in that abyss, is\nsufficient to create consternation.\n\nOh, poor thought of miserable wretches!\n\nAlas! will no one come to the succor of the human soul in that\ndarkness? Is it her destiny there to await forever the mind, the\nliberator, the immense rider of Pegasi and hippogriffs, the combatant\nof heroes of the dawn who shall descend from the azure between two\nwings, the radiant knight of the future? Will she forever summon in\nvain to her assistance the lance of light of the ideal? Is she\ncondemned to hear the fearful approach of Evil through the density of\nthe gulf, and to catch glimpses, nearer and nearer at hand, beneath the\nhideous water of that dragon’s head, that maw streaked with foam, and\nthat writhing undulation of claws, swellings, and rings? Must it remain\nthere, without a gleam of light, without hope, given over to that\nterrible approach, vaguely scented out by the monster, shuddering,\ndishevelled, wringing its arms, forever chained to the rock of night, a\nsombre Andromeda white and naked amid the shadows!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—SLANG WHICH WEEPS AND SLANG WHICH LAUGHS\n\n\nAs the reader perceives, slang in its entirety, slang of four hundred\nyears ago, like the slang of to-day, is permeated with that sombre,\nsymbolical spirit which gives to all words a mien which is now\nmournful, now menacing. One feels in it the wild and ancient sadness of\nthose vagrants of the Court of Miracles who played at cards with packs\nof their own, some of which have come down to us. The eight of clubs,\nfor instance, represented a huge tree bearing eight enormous trefoil\nleaves, a sort of fantastic personification of the forest. At the foot\nof this tree a fire was burning, over which three hares were roasting a\nhuntsman on a spit, and behind him, on another fire, hung a steaming\npot, whence emerged the head of a dog. Nothing can be more melancholy\nthan these reprisals in painting, by a pack of cards, in the presence\nof stakes for the roasting of smugglers and of the cauldron for the\nboiling of counterfeiters. The diverse forms assumed by thought in the\nrealm of slang, even song, even raillery, even menace, all partook of\nthis powerless and dejected character. All the songs, the melodies of\nsome of which have been collected, were humble and lamentable to the\npoint of evoking tears. The _pègre_ is always the poor _pègre_, and he\nis always the hare in hiding, the fugitive mouse, the flying bird. He\nhardly complains, he contents himself with sighing; one of his moans\nhas come down to us: “I do not understand how God, the father of men,\ncan torture his children and his grandchildren and hear them cry,\nwithout himself suffering torture.\"43 The wretch, whenever he has time\nto think, makes himself small before the low, and frail in the presence\nof society; he lies down flat on his face, he entreats, he appeals to\nthe side of compassion; we feel that he is conscious of his guilt.\n\nTowards the middle of the last century a change took place, prison\nsongs and thieves’ ritournelles assumed, so to speak, an insolent and\njovial mien. The plaintive _maluré_ was replaced by the _larifla_. We\nfind in the eighteenth century, in nearly all the songs of the galleys\nand prisons, a diabolical and enigmatical gayety. We hear this strident\nand lilting refrain which we should say had been lighted up by a\nphosphorescent gleam, and which seems to have been flung into the\nforest by a will-o’-the-wisp playing the fife:—\n\nMiralabi suslababo\nMirliton ribonribette\nSurlababi mirlababo\nMirliton ribonribo.\n\n\nThis was sung in a cellar or in a nook of the forest while cutting a\nman’s throat.\n\nA serious symptom. In the eighteenth century, the ancient melancholy of\nthe dejected classes vanishes. They began to laugh. They rally the\n_grand meg_ and the _grand dab_. Given Louis XV. they call the King of\nFrance “le Marquis de Pantin.” And behold, they are almost gay. A sort\nof gleam proceeds from these miserable wretches, as though their\nconsciences were not heavy within them any more. These lamentable\ntribes of darkness have no longer merely the desperate audacity of\nactions, they possess the heedless audacity of mind. A sign that they\nare losing the sense of their criminality, and that they feel, even\namong thinkers and dreamers, some indefinable support which the latter\nthemselves know not of. A sign that theft and pillage are beginning to\nfilter into doctrines and sophisms, in such a way as to lose somewhat\nof their ugliness, while communicating much of it to sophisms and\ndoctrines. A sign, in short, of some outbreak which is prodigious and\nnear unless some diversion shall arise.\n\nLet us pause a moment. Whom are we accusing here? Is it the eighteenth\ncentury? Is it philosophy? Certainly not. The work of the eighteenth\ncentury is healthy and good and wholesome. The encyclopedists, Diderot\nat their head; the physiocrates, Turgot at their head; the\nphilosophers, Voltaire at their head; the Utopians, Rousseau at their\nhead,—these are four sacred legions. Humanity’s immense advance towards\nthe light is due to them. They are the four vanguards of the human\nrace, marching towards the four cardinal points of progress. Diderot\ntowards the beautiful, Turgot towards the useful, Voltaire towards the\ntrue, Rousseau towards the just. But by the side of and above the\nphilosophers, there were the sophists, a venomous vegetation mingled\nwith a healthy growth, hemlock in the virgin forest. While the\nexecutioner was burning the great books of the liberators of the\ncentury on the grand staircase of the court-house, writers now\nforgotten were publishing, with the King’s sanction, no one knows what\nstrangely disorganizing writings, which were eagerly read by the\nunfortunate. Some of these publications, odd to say, which were\npatronized by a prince, are to be found in the Secret Library. These\nfacts, significant but unknown, were imperceptible on the surface.\nSometimes, in the very obscurity of a fact lurks its danger. It is\nobscure because it is underhand. Of all these writers, the one who\nprobably then excavated in the masses the most unhealthy gallery was\nRestif de La Bretonne.\n\nThis work, peculiar to the whole of Europe, effected more ravages in\nGermany than anywhere else. In Germany, during a given period, summed\nup by Schiller in his famous drama _The Robbers_, theft and pillage\nrose up in protest against property and labor, assimilated certain\nspecious and false elementary ideas, which, though just in appearance,\nwere absurd in reality, enveloped themselves in these ideas,\ndisappeared within them, after a fashion, assumed an abstract name,\npassed into the state of theory, and in that shape circulated among the\nlaborious, suffering, and honest masses, unknown even to the imprudent\nchemists who had prepared the mixture, unknown even to the masses who\naccepted it. Whenever a fact of this sort presents itself, the case is\ngrave. Suffering engenders wrath; and while the prosperous classes\nblind themselves or fall asleep, which is the same thing as shutting\none’s eyes, the hatred of the unfortunate classes lights its torch at\nsome aggrieved or ill-made spirit which dreams in a corner, and sets\nitself to the scrutiny of society. The scrutiny of hatred is a terrible\nthing.\n\nHence, if the ill-fortune of the times so wills it, those fearful\ncommotions which were formerly called _jacqueries_, beside which purely\npolitical agitations are the merest child’s play, which are no longer\nthe conflict of the oppressed and the oppressor, but the revolt of\ndiscomfort against comfort. Then everything crumbles.\n\nJacqueries are earthquakes of the people.\n\nIt is this peril, possibly imminent towards the close of the eighteenth\ncentury, which the French Revolution, that immense act of probity, cut\nshort.\n\nThe French Revolution, which is nothing else than the idea armed with\nthe sword, rose erect, and, with the same abrupt movement, closed the\ndoor of ill and opened the door of good.\n\nIt put a stop to torture, promulgated the truth, expelled miasma,\nrendered the century healthy, crowned the populace.\n\nIt may be said of it that it created man a second time, by giving him a\nsecond soul, the right.\n\nThe nineteenth century has inherited and profited by its work, and\nto-day, the social catastrophe to which we lately alluded is simply\nimpossible. Blind is he who announces it! Foolish is he who fears it!\nRevolution is the vaccine of Jacquerie.\n\nThanks to the Revolution, social conditions have changed. Feudal and\nmonarchical maladies no longer run in our blood. There is no more of\nthe Middle Ages in our constitution. We no longer live in the days when\nterrible swarms within made irruptions, when one heard beneath his feet\nthe obscure course of a dull rumble, when indescribable elevations from\nmole-like tunnels appeared on the surface of civilization, where the\nsoil cracked open, where the roofs of caverns yawned, and where one\nsuddenly beheld monstrous heads emerging from the earth.\n\nThe revolutionary sense is a moral sense. The sentiment of right, once\ndeveloped, develops the sentiment of duty. The law of all is liberty,\nwhich ends where the liberty of others begins, according to\nRobespierre’s admirable definition. Since ’89, the whole people has\nbeen dilating into a sublime individual; there is not a poor man, who,\npossessing his right, has not his ray of sun; the die-of-hunger feels\nwithin him the honesty of France; the dignity of the citizen is an\ninternal armor; he who is free is scrupulous; he who votes reigns.\nHence incorruptibility; hence the miscarriage of unhealthy lusts; hence\neyes heroically lowered before temptations. The revolutionary\nwholesomeness is such, that on a day of deliverance, a 14th of July, a\n10th of August, there is no longer any populace. The first cry of the\nenlightened and increasing throngs is: death to thieves! Progress is an\nhonest man; the ideal and the absolute do not filch\npocket-handkerchiefs. By whom were the wagons containing the wealth of\nthe Tuileries escorted in 1848? By the rag-pickers of the Faubourg\nSaint-Antoine. Rags mounted guard over the treasure. Virtue rendered\nthese tatterdemalions resplendent. In those wagons in chests, hardly\nclosed, and some, even, half-open, amid a hundred dazzling caskets, was\nthat ancient crown of France, studded with diamonds, surmounted by the\ncarbuncle of royalty, by the Regent diamond, which was worth thirty\nmillions. Barefooted, they guarded that crown.\n\nHence, no more Jacquerie. I regret it for the sake of the skilful. The\nold fear has produced its last effects in that quarter; and henceforth\nit can no longer be employed in politics. The principal spring of the\nred spectre is broken. Every one knows it now. The scare-crow scares no\nlonger. The birds take liberties with the mannikin, foul creatures\nalight upon it, the bourgeois laugh at it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—THE TWO DUTIES: TO WATCH AND TO HOPE\n\n\nThis being the case, is all social danger dispelled? Certainly not.\nThere is no Jacquerie; society may rest assured on that point; blood\nwill no longer rush to its head. But let society take heed to the\nmanner in which it breathes. Apoplexy is no longer to be feared, but\nphthisis is there. Social phthisis is called misery.\n\nOne can perish from being undermined as well as from being struck by\nlightning.\n\nLet us not weary of repeating, and sympathetic souls must not forget\nthat this is the first of fraternal obligations, and selfish hearts\nmust understand that the first of political necessities consists in\nthinking first of all of the disinherited and sorrowing throngs, in\nsolacing, airing, enlightening, loving them, in enlarging their horizon\nto a magnificent extent, in lavishing upon them education in every\nform, in offering them the example of labor, never the example of\nidleness, in diminishing the individual burden by enlarging the notion\nof the universal aim, in setting a limit to poverty without setting a\nlimit to wealth, in creating vast fields of public and popular\nactivity, in having, like Briareus, a hundred hands to extend in all\ndirections to the oppressed and the feeble, in employing the collective\npower for that grand duty of opening workshops for all arms, schools\nfor all aptitudes, and laboratories for all degrees of intelligence, in\naugmenting salaries, diminishing trouble, balancing what should be and\nwhat is, that is to say, in proportioning enjoyment to effort and a\nglut to need; in a word, in evolving from the social apparatus more\nlight and more comfort for the benefit of those who suffer and those\nwho are ignorant.\n\nAnd, let us say it, all this is but the beginning. The true question is\nthis: labor cannot be a law without being a right.\n\nWe will not insist upon this point; this is not the proper place for\nthat.\n\nIf nature calls itself Providence, society should call itself\nforesight.\n\nIntellectual and moral growth is no less indispensable than material\nimprovement. To know is a sacrament, to think is the prime necessity,\ntruth is nourishment as well as grain. A reason which fasts from\nscience and wisdom grows thin. Let us enter equal complaint against\nstomachs and minds which do not eat. If there is anything more\nheart-breaking than a body perishing for lack of bread, it is a soul\nwhich is dying from hunger for the light.\n\nThe whole of progress tends in the direction of solution. Some day we\nshall be amazed. As the human race mounts upward, the deep layers\nemerge naturally from the zone of distress. The obliteration of misery\nwill be accomplished by a simple elevation of level.\n\nWe should do wrong were we to doubt this blessed consummation.\n\nThe past is very strong, it is true, at the present moment. It\ncensures. This rejuvenation of a corpse is surprising. Behold, it is\nwalking and advancing. It seems a victor; this dead body is a\nconqueror. He arrives with his legions, superstitions, with his sword,\ndespotism, with his banner, ignorance; a while ago, he won ten battles.\nHe advances, he threatens, he laughs, he is at our doors. Let us not\ndespair, on our side. Let us sell the field on which Hannibal is\nencamped.\n\nWhat have we to fear, we who believe?\n\nNo such thing as a back-flow of ideas exists any more than there exists\na return of a river on its course.\n\nBut let those who do not desire a future reflect on this matter. When\nthey say “no” to progress, it is not the future but themselves that\nthey are condemning. They are giving themselves a sad malady; they are\ninoculating themselves with the past. There is but one way of rejecting\nTo-morrow, and that is to die.\n\nNow, no death, that of the body as late as possible, that of the soul\nnever,—this is what we desire.\n\nYes, the enigma will utter its word, the sphinx will speak, the problem\nwill be solved.\n\nYes, the people, sketched out by the eighteenth century, will be\nfinished by the nineteenth. He who doubts this is an idiot! The future\nblossoming, the near blossoming forth of universal well-being, is a\ndivinely fatal phenomenon.\n\nImmense combined propulsions direct human affairs and conduct them\nwithin a given time to a logical state, that is to say, to a state of\nequilibrium; that is to say, to equity. A force composed of earth and\nheaven results from humanity and governs it; this force is a worker of\nmiracles; marvellous issues are no more difficult to it than\nextraordinary vicissitudes. Aided by science, which comes from one man,\nand by the event, which comes from another, it is not greatly alarmed\nby these contradictions in the attitude of problems, which seem\nimpossibilities to the vulgar herd. It is no less skilful at causing a\nsolution to spring forth from the reconciliation of ideas, than a\nlesson from the reconciliation of facts, and we may expect anything\nfrom that mysterious power of progress, which brought the Orient and\nthe Occident face to face one fine day, in the depths of a sepulchre,\nand made the imaums converse with Bonaparte in the interior of the\nGreat Pyramid.\n\nIn the meantime, let there be no halt, no hesitation, no pause in the\ngrandiose onward march of minds. Social philosophy consists essentially\nin science and peace. Its object is, and its result must be, to\ndissolve wrath by the study of antagonisms. It examines, it\nscrutinizes, it analyzes; then it puts together once more, it proceeds\nby means of reduction, discarding all hatred.\n\nMore than once, a society has been seen to give way before the wind\nwhich is let loose upon mankind; history is full of the shipwrecks of\nnations and empires; manners, customs, laws, religions,—and some fine\nday that unknown force, the hurricane, passes by and bears them all\naway. The civilizations of India, of Chaldea, of Persia, of Syria, of\nEgypt, have disappeared one after the other. Why? We know not. What are\nthe causes of these disasters? We do not know. Could these societies\nhave been saved? Was it their fault? Did they persist in the fatal vice\nwhich destroyed them? What is the amount of suicide in these terrible\ndeaths of a nation and a race? Questions to which there exists no\nreply. Darkness enwraps condemned civilizations. They sprung a leak,\nthen they sank. We have nothing more to say; and it is with a sort of\nterror that we look on, at the bottom of that sea which is called the\npast, behind those colossal waves, at the shipwreck of those immense\nvessels, Babylon, Nineveh, Tarsus, Thebes, Rome, beneath the fearful\ngusts which emerge from all the mouths of the shadows. But shadows are\nthere, and light is here. We are not acquainted with the maladies of\nthese ancient civilizations, we do not know the infirmities of our own.\nEverywhere upon it we have the right of light, we contemplate its\nbeauties, we lay bare its defects. Where it is ill, we probe; and the\nsickness once diagnosed, the study of the cause leads to the discovery\nof the remedy. Our civilization, the work of twenty centuries, is its\nlaw and its prodigy; it is worth the trouble of saving. It will be\nsaved. It is already much to have solaced it; its enlightenment is yet\nanother point. All the labors of modern social philosophies must\nconverge towards this point. The thinker of to-day has a great duty—to\nauscultate civilization.\n\nWe repeat, that this auscultation brings encouragement; it is by this\npersistence in encouragement that we wish to conclude these pages, an\naustere interlude in a mournful drama. Beneath the social mortality, we\nfeel human imperishableness. The globe does not perish, because it has\nthese wounds, craters, eruptions, sulphur pits, here and there, nor\nbecause of a volcano which ejects its pus. The maladies of the people\ndo not kill man.\n\nAnd yet, any one who follows the course of social clinics shakes his\nhead at times. The strongest, the tenderest, the most logical have\ntheir hours of weakness.\n\nWill the future arrive? It seems as though we might almost put this\nquestion, when we behold so much terrible darkness. Melancholy\nface-to-face encounter of selfish and wretched. On the part of the\nselfish, the prejudices, shadows of costly education, appetite\nincreasing through intoxication, a giddiness of prosperity which dulls,\na fear of suffering which, in some, goes as far as an aversion for the\nsuffering, an implacable satisfaction, the _I_ so swollen that it bars\nthe soul; on the side of the wretched covetousness, envy, hatred of\nseeing others enjoy, the profound impulses of the human beast towards\nassuaging its desires, hearts full of mist, sadness, need, fatality,\nimpure and simple ignorance.\n\nShall we continue to raise our eyes to heaven? is the luminous point\nwhich we distinguish there one of those which vanish? The ideal is\nfrightful to behold, thus lost in the depths, small, isolated,\nimperceptible, brilliant, but surrounded by those great, black menaces,\nmonstrously heaped around it; yet no more in danger than a star in the\nmaw of the clouds.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHTH—ENCHANTMENTS AND DESOLATIONS\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—FULL LIGHT\n\n\nThe reader has probably understood that Éponine, having recognized\nthrough the gate, the inhabitant of that Rue Plumet whither Magnon had\nsent her, had begun by keeping the ruffians away from the Rue Plumet,\nand had then conducted Marius thither, and that, after many days spent\nin ecstasy before that gate, Marius, drawn on by that force which draws\nthe iron to the magnet and a lover towards the stones of which is built\nthe house of her whom he loves, had finally entered Cosette’s garden as\nRomeo entered the garden of Juliet. This had even proved easier for him\nthan for Romeo; Romeo was obliged to scale a wall, Marius had only to\nuse a little force on one of the bars of the decrepit gate which\nvacillated in its rusty recess, after the fashion of old people’s\nteeth. Marius was slender and readily passed through.\n\nAs there was never any one in the street, and as Marius never entered\nthe garden except at night, he ran no risk of being seen.\n\nBeginning with that blessed and holy hour when a kiss betrothed these\ntwo souls, Marius was there every evening. If, at that period of her\nexistence, Cosette had fallen in love with a man in the least\nunscrupulous or debauched, she would have been lost; for there are\ngenerous natures which yield themselves, and Cosette was one of them.\nOne of woman’s magnanimities is to yield. Love, at the height where it\nis absolute, is complicated with some indescribably celestial blindness\nof modesty. But what dangers you run, O noble souls! Often you give the\nheart, and we take the body. Your heart remains with you, you gaze upon\nit in the gloom with a shudder. Love has no middle course; it either\nruins or it saves. All human destiny lies in this dilemma. This\ndilemma, ruin, or safety, is set forth no more inexorably by any\nfatality than by love. Love is life, if it is not death. Cradle; also\ncoffin. The same sentiment says “yes” and “no” in the human heart. Of\nall the things that God has made, the human heart is the one which\nsheds the most light, alas! and the most darkness.\n\nGod willed that Cosette’s love should encounter one of the loves which\nsave.\n\nThroughout the whole of the month of May of that year 1832, there were\nthere, in every night, in that poor, neglected garden, beneath that\nthicket which grew thicker and more fragrant day by day, two beings\ncomposed of all chastity, all innocence, overflowing with all the\nfelicity of heaven, nearer to the archangels than to mankind, pure,\nhonest, intoxicated, radiant, who shone for each other amid the\nshadows. It seemed to Cosette that Marius had a crown, and to Marius\nthat Cosette had a nimbus. They touched each other, they gazed at each\nother, they clasped each other’s hands, they pressed close to each\nother; but there was a distance which they did not pass. Not that they\nrespected it; they did not know of its existence. Marius was conscious\nof a barrier, Cosette’s innocence; and Cosette of a support, Marius’\nloyalty. The first kiss had also been the last. Marius, since that\ntime, had not gone further than to touch Cosette’s hand, or her\nkerchief, or a lock of her hair, with his lips. For him, Cosette was a\nperfume and not a woman. He inhaled her. She refused nothing, and he\nasked nothing. Cosette was happy, and Marius was satisfied. They lived\nin this ecstatic state which can be described as the dazzling of one\nsoul by another soul. It was the ineffable first embrace of two maiden\nsouls in the ideal. Two swans meeting on the Jungfrau.\n\nAt that hour of love, an hour when voluptuousness is absolutely mute,\nbeneath the omnipotence of ecstasy, Marius, the pure and seraphic\nMarius, would rather have gone to a woman of the town than have raised\nCosette’s robe to the height of her ankle. Once, in the moonlight,\nCosette stooped to pick up something on the ground, her bodice fell\napart and permitted a glimpse of the beginning of her throat. Marius\nturned away his eyes.\n\nWhat took place between these two beings? Nothing. They adored each\nother.\n\nAt night, when they were there, that garden seemed a living and a\nsacred spot. All flowers unfolded around them and sent them incense;\nand they opened their souls and scattered them over the flowers. The\nwanton and vigorous vegetation quivered, full of strength and\nintoxication, around these two innocents, and they uttered words of\nlove which set the trees to trembling.\n\nWhat words were these? Breaths. Nothing more. These breaths sufficed to\ntrouble and to touch all nature round about. Magic power which we\nshould find it difficult to understand were we to read in a book these\nconversations which are made to be borne away and dispersed like smoke\nwreaths by the breeze beneath the leaves. Take from those murmurs of\ntwo lovers that melody which proceeds from the soul and which\naccompanies them like a lyre, and what remains is nothing more than a\nshade; you say: “What! is that all!” eh! yes, childish prattle,\nrepetitions, laughter at nothing, nonsense, everything that is deepest\nand most sublime in the world! The only things which are worth the\ntrouble of saying and hearing!\n\nThe man who has never heard, the man who has never uttered these\nabsurdities, these paltry remarks, is an imbecile and a malicious\nfellow. Cosette said to Marius:—\n\n“Dost thou know?—”\n\n\n[In all this and athwart this celestial maidenliness, and without\neither of them being able to say how it had come about, they had begun\nto call each other _thou_.]\n\n“Dost thou know? My name is Euphrasie.”\n\n\n“Euphrasie? Why, no, thy name is Cosette.”\n\n\n“Oh! Cosette is a very ugly name that was given to me when I was a\nlittle thing. But my real name is Euphrasie. Dost thou like that\nname—Euphrasie?”\n\n\n“Yes. But Cosette is not ugly.”\n\n\n“Do you like it better than Euphrasie?”\n\n\n“Why, yes.”\n\n\n“Then I like it better too. Truly, it is pretty, Cosette. Call me\nCosette.”\n\n\nAnd the smile that she added made of this dialogue an idyl worthy of a\ngrove situated in heaven. On another occasion she gazed intently at him\nand exclaimed:—\n\n“Monsieur, you are handsome, you are good-looking, you are witty, you\nare not at all stupid, you are much more learned than I am, but I bid\nyou defiance with this word: I love you!”\n\n\nAnd Marius, in the very heavens, thought he heard a strain sung by a\nstar.\n\nOr she bestowed on him a gentle tap because he coughed, and she said to\nhim:—\n\n“Don’t cough, sir; I will not have people cough on my domain without my\npermission. It’s very naughty to cough and to disturb me. I want you to\nbe well, because, in the first place, if you were not well, I should be\nvery unhappy. What should I do then?”\n\n\nAnd this was simply divine.\n\nOnce Marius said to Cosette:—\n\n“Just imagine, I thought at one time that your name was Ursule.”\n\n\nThis made both of them laugh the whole evening.\n\nIn the middle of another conversation, he chanced to exclaim:—\n\n“Oh! One day, at the Luxembourg, I had a good mind to finish breaking\nup a veteran!” But he stopped short, and went no further. He would have\nbeen obliged to speak to Cosette of her garter, and that was\nimpossible. This bordered on a strange theme, the flesh, before which\nthat immense and innocent love recoiled with a sort of sacred fright.\n\nMarius pictured life with Cosette to himself like this, without\nanything else; to come every evening to the Rue Plumet, to displace the\nold and accommodating bar of the chief-justice’s gate, to sit elbow to\nelbow on that bench, to gaze through the trees at the scintillation of\nthe on-coming night, to fit a fold of the knee of his trousers into the\nample fall of Cosette’s gown, to caress her thumb-nail, to call her\n_thou_, to smell of the same flower, one after the other, forever,\nindefinitely. During this time, clouds passed above their heads. Every\ntime that the wind blows it bears with it more of the dreams of men\nthan of the clouds of heaven.\n\nThis chaste, almost shy love was not devoid of gallantry, by any means.\nTo pay compliments to the woman whom a man loves is the first method of\nbestowing caresses, and he is half audacious who tries it. A compliment\nis something like a kiss through a veil. Voluptuousness mingles there\nwith its sweet tiny point, while it hides itself. The heart draws back\nbefore voluptuousness only to love the more. Marius’ blandishments, all\nsaturated with fancy, were, so to speak, of azure hue. The birds when\nthey fly up yonder, in the direction of the angels, must hear such\nwords. There were mingled with them, nevertheless, life, humanity, all\nthe positiveness of which Marius was capable. It was what is said in\nthe bower, a prelude to what will be said in the chamber; a lyrical\neffusion, strophe and sonnet intermingled, pleasing hyperboles of\ncooing, all the refinements of adoration arranged in a bouquet and\nexhaling a celestial perfume, an ineffable twitter of heart to heart.\n\n“Oh!” murmured Marius, “how beautiful you are! I dare not look at you.\nIt is all over with me when I contemplate you. You are a grace. I know\nnot what is the matter with me. The hem of your gown, when the tip of\nyour shoe peeps from beneath, upsets me. And then, what an enchanted\ngleam when you open your thought even but a little! You talk\nastonishingly good sense. It seems to me at times that you are a dream.\nSpeak, I listen, I admire. Oh Cosette! how strange it is and how\ncharming! I am really beside myself. You are adorable, Mademoiselle. I\nstudy your feet with the microscope and your soul with the telescope.”\n\n\nAnd Cosette answered:—\n\n“I have been loving a little more all the time that has passed since\nthis morning.”\n\n\nQuestions and replies took care of themselves in this dialogue, which\nalways turned with mutual consent upon love, as the little pith figures\nalways turn on their peg.\n\nCosette’s whole person was ingenuousness, ingenuity, transparency,\nwhiteness, candor, radiance. It might have been said of Cosette that\nshe was clear. She produced on those who saw her the sensation of April\nand dawn. There was dew in her eyes. Cosette was a condensation of the\nauroral light in the form of a woman.\n\nIt was quite simple that Marius should admire her, since he adored her.\nBut the truth is, that this little school-girl, fresh from the convent,\ntalked with exquisite penetration and uttered, at times, all sorts of\ntrue and delicate sayings. Her prattle was conversation. She never made\na mistake about anything, and she saw things justly. The woman feels\nand speaks with the tender instinct of the heart, which is infallible.\n\nNo one understands so well as a woman, how to say things that are, at\nonce, both sweet and deep. Sweetness and depth, they are the whole of\nwoman; in them lies the whole of heaven.\n\nIn this full felicity, tears welled up to their eyes every instant. A\ncrushed lady-bug, a feather fallen from a nest, a branch of hawthorn\nbroken, aroused their pity, and their ecstasy, sweetly mingled with\nmelancholy, seemed to ask nothing better than to weep. The most\nsovereign symptom of love is a tenderness that is, at times, almost\nunbearable.\n\nAnd, in addition to this,—all these contradictions are the lightning\nplay of love,—they were fond of laughing, they laughed readily and with\na delicious freedom, and so familiarly that they sometimes presented\nthe air of two boys.\n\nStill, though unknown to hearts intoxicated with purity, nature is\nalways present and will not be forgotten. She is there with her brutal\nand sublime object; and however great may be the innocence of souls,\none feels in the most modest private interview, the adorable and\nmysterious shade which separates a couple of lovers from a pair of\nfriends.\n\nThey idolized each other.\n\nThe permanent and the immutable are persistent. People live, they\nsmile, they laugh, they make little grimaces with the tips of their\nlips, they interlace their fingers, they call each other _thou_, and\nthat does not prevent eternity.\n\nTwo lovers hide themselves in the evening, in the twilight, in the\ninvisible, with the birds, with the roses; they fascinate each other in\nthe darkness with their hearts which they throw into their eyes, they\nmurmur, they whisper, and in the meantime, immense librations of the\nplanets fill the infinite universe.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—THE BEWILDERMENT OF PERFECT HAPPINESS\n\n\nThey existed vaguely, frightened at their happiness. They did not\nnotice the cholera which decimated Paris precisely during that very\nmonth. They had confided in each other as far as possible, but this had\nnot extended much further than their names. Marius had told Cosette\nthat he was an orphan, that his name was Marius Pontmercy, that he was\na lawyer, that he lived by writing things for publishers, that his\nfather had been a colonel, that the latter had been a hero, and that\nhe, Marius, was on bad terms with his grandfather who was rich. He had\nalso hinted at being a baron, but this had produced no effect on\nCosette. She did not know the meaning of the word. Marius was Marius.\nOn her side, she had confided to him that she had been brought up at\nthe Petit-Picpus convent, that her mother, like his own, was dead, that\nher father’s name was M. Fauchelevent, that he was very good, that he\ngave a great deal to the poor, but that he was poor himself, and that\nhe denied himself everything though he denied her nothing.\n\nStrange to say, in the sort of symphony which Marius had lived since he\nhad been in the habit of seeing Cosette, the past, even the most recent\npast, had become so confused and distant to him, that what Cosette told\nhim satisfied him completely. It did not even occur to him to tell her\nabout the nocturnal adventure in the hovel, about Thénardier, about the\nburn, and about the strange attitude and singular flight of her father.\nMarius had momentarily forgotten all this; in the evening he did not\neven know that there had been a morning, what he had done, where he had\nbreakfasted, nor who had spoken to him; he had songs in his ears which\nrendered him deaf to every other thought; he only existed at the hours\nwhen he saw Cosette. Then, as he was in heaven, it was quite natural\nthat he should forget earth. Both bore languidly the indefinable burden\nof immaterial pleasures. Thus lived these somnambulists who are called\nlovers.\n\nAlas! Who is there who has not felt all these things? Why does there\ncome an hour when one emerges from this azure, and why does life go on\nafterwards?\n\nLoving almost takes the place of thinking. Love is an ardent\nforgetfulness of all the rest. Then ask logic of passion if you will.\nThere is no more absolute logical sequence in the human heart than\nthere is a perfect geometrical figure in the celestial mechanism. For\nCosette and Marius nothing existed except Marius and Cosette. The\nuniverse around them had fallen into a hole. They lived in a golden\nminute. There was nothing before them, nothing behind. It hardly\noccurred to Marius that Cosette had a father. His brain was dazzled and\nobliterated. Of what did these lovers talk then? We have seen, of the\nflowers, and the swallows, the setting sun and the rising moon, and all\nsorts of important things. They had told each other everything except\neverything. The everything of lovers is nothing. But the father, the\nrealities, that lair, the ruffians, that adventure, to what purpose?\nAnd was he very sure that this nightmare had actually existed? They\nwere two, and they adored each other, and beyond that there was\nnothing. Nothing else existed. It is probable that this vanishing of\nhell in our rear is inherent to the arrival of paradise. Have we beheld\ndemons? Are there any? Have we trembled? Have we suffered? We no longer\nknow. A rosy cloud hangs over it.\n\nSo these two beings lived in this manner, high aloft, with all that\nimprobability which is in nature; neither at the nadir nor at the\nzenith, between man and seraphim, above the mire, below the ether, in\nthe clouds; hardly flesh and blood, soul and ecstasy from head to foot;\nalready too sublime to walk the earth, still too heavily charged with\nhumanity to disappear in the blue, suspended like atoms which are\nwaiting to be precipitated; apparently beyond the bounds of destiny;\nignorant of that rut; yesterday, to-day, to-morrow; amazed, rapturous,\nfloating, soaring; at times so light that they could take their flight\nout into the infinite; almost prepared to soar away to all eternity.\nThey slept wide-awake, thus sweetly lulled. Oh! splendid lethargy of\nthe real overwhelmed by the ideal.\n\nSometimes, beautiful as Cosette was, Marius shut his eyes in her\npresence. The best way to look at the soul is through closed eyes.\n\nMarius and Cosette never asked themselves whither this was to lead\nthem. They considered that they had already arrived. It is a strange\nclaim on man’s part to wish that love should lead to something.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—THE BEGINNING OF SHADOW\n\n\nJean Valjean suspected nothing.\n\nCosette, who was rather less dreamy than Marius, was gay, and that\nsufficed for Jean Valjean’s happiness. The thoughts which Cosette\ncherished, her tender preoccupations, Marius’ image which filled her\nheart, took away nothing from the incomparable purity of her beautiful,\nchaste, and smiling brow. She was at the age when the virgin bears her\nlove as the angel his lily. So Jean Valjean was at ease. And then, when\ntwo lovers have come to an understanding, things always go well; the\nthird party who might disturb their love is kept in a state of perfect\nblindness by a restricted number of precautions which are always the\nsame in the case of all lovers. Thus, Cosette never objected to any of\nJean Valjean’s proposals. Did she want to take a walk? “Yes, dear\nlittle father.” Did she want to stay at home? Very good. Did he wish to\npass the evening with Cosette? She was delighted. As he always went to\nbed at ten o’clock, Marius did not come to the garden on such occasions\nuntil after that hour, when, from the street, he heard Cosette open the\nlong glass door on the veranda. Of course, no one ever met Marius in\nthe daytime. Jean Valjean never even dreamed any longer that Marius was\nin existence. Only once, one morning, he chanced to say to Cosette:\n“Why, you have whitewash on your back!” On the previous evening,\nMarius, in a transport, had pushed Cosette against the wall.\n\nOld Toussaint, who retired early, thought of nothing but her sleep, and\nwas as ignorant of the whole matter as Jean Valjean.\n\nMarius never set foot in the house. When he was with Cosette, they hid\nthemselves in a recess near the steps, in order that they might neither\nbe seen nor heard from the street, and there they sat, frequently\ncontenting themselves, by way of conversation, with pressing each\nother’s hands twenty times a minute as they gazed at the branches of\nthe trees. At such times, a thunderbolt might have fallen thirty paces\nfrom them, and they would not have noticed it, so deeply was the\nreverie of the one absorbed and sunk in the reverie of the other.\n\nLimpid purity. Hours wholly white; almost all alike. This sort of love\nis a recollection of lily petals and the plumage of the dove.\n\nThe whole extent of the garden lay between them and the street. Every\ntime that Marius entered and left, he carefully adjusted the bar of the\ngate in such a manner that no displacement was visible.\n\nHe usually went away about midnight, and returned to Courfeyrac’s\nlodgings. Courfeyrac said to Bahorel:—\n\n“Would you believe it? Marius comes home nowadays at one o’clock in the\nmorning.”\n\n\nBahorel replied:—\n\n“What do you expect? There’s always a petard in a seminary fellow.”\n\n\nAt times, Courfeyrac folded his arms, assumed a serious air, and said\nto Marius:—\n\n“You are getting irregular in your habits, young man.”\n\n\nCourfeyrac, being a practical man, did not take in good part this\nreflection of an invisible paradise upon Marius; he was not much in the\nhabit of concealed passions; it made him impatient, and now and then he\ncalled upon Marius to come back to reality.\n\nOne morning, he threw him this admonition:—\n\n“My dear fellow, you produce upon me the effect of being located in the\nmoon, the realm of dreams, the province of illusions, capital,\nsoap-bubble. Come, be a good boy, what’s her name?”\n\n\nBut nothing could induce Marius “to talk.” They might have torn out his\nnails before one of the two sacred syllables of which that ineffable\nname, Cosette, was composed. True love is as luminous as the dawn and\nas silent as the tomb. Only, Courfeyrac saw this change in Marius, that\nhis taciturnity was of the beaming order.\n\nDuring this sweet month of May, Marius and Cosette learned to know\nthese immense delights. To dispute and to say _you_ for _thou_, simply\nthat they might say _thou_ the better afterwards. To talk at great\nlength with very minute details, of persons in whom they took not the\nslightest interest in the world; another proof that in that ravishing\nopera called love, the libretto counts for almost nothing;\n\nFor Marius, to listen to Cosette discussing finery;\n\nFor Cosette, to listen to Marius talk in politics;\n\nTo listen, knee pressed to knee, to the carriages rolling along the Rue\nde Babylone;\n\nTo gaze upon the same planet in space, or at the same glowworm gleaming\nin the grass;\n\nTo hold their peace together; a still greater delight than\nconversation;\n\nEtc., etc.\n\nIn the meantime, divers complications were approaching.\n\nOne evening, Marius was on his way to the rendezvous, by way of the\nBoulevard des Invalides. He habitually walked with drooping head. As he\nwas on the point of turning the corner of the Rue Plumet, he heard some\none quite close to him say:—\n\n“Good evening, Monsieur Marius.”\n\n\nHe raised his head and recognized Éponine.\n\nThis produced a singular effect upon him. He had not thought of that\ngirl a single time since the day when she had conducted him to the Rue\nPlumet, he had not seen her again, and she had gone completely out of\nhis mind. He had no reasons for anything but gratitude towards her, he\nowed her his happiness, and yet, it was embarrassing to him to meet\nher.\n\nIt is an error to think that passion, when it is pure and happy, leads\nman to a state of perfection; it simply leads him, as we have noted, to\na state of oblivion. In this situation, man forgets to be bad, but he\nalso forgets to be good. Gratitude, duty, matters essential and\nimportant to be remembered, vanish. At any other time, Marius would\nhave behaved quite differently to Éponine. Absorbed in Cosette, he had\nnot even clearly put it to himself that this Éponine was named Éponine\nThénardier, and that she bore the name inscribed in his father’s will,\nthat name, for which, but a few months before, he would have so\nardently sacrificed himself. We show Marius as he was. His father\nhimself was fading out of his soul to some extent, under the splendor\nof his love.\n\nHe replied with some embarrassment:—\n\n“Ah! so it’s you, Éponine?”\n\n\n“Why do you call me _you?_ Have I done anything to you?”\n\n\n“No,” he answered.\n\nCertainly, he had nothing against her. Far from it. Only, he felt that\nhe could not do otherwise, now that he used _thou_ to Cosette, than say\n_you_ to Éponine.\n\nAs he remained silent, she exclaimed:—\n\n“Say—”\n\n\nThen she paused. It seemed as though words failed that creature\nformerly so heedless and so bold. She tried to smile and could not.\nThen she resumed:—\n\n“Well?”\n\n\nThen she paused again, and remained with downcast eyes.\n\n“Good evening, Mr. Marius,” said she suddenly and abruptly; and away\nshe went.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—A CAB RUNS IN ENGLISH AND BARKS IN SLANG\n\n\nThe following day was the 3d of June, 1832, a date which it is\nnecessary to indicate on account of the grave events which at that\nepoch hung on the horizon of Paris in the state of lightning-charged\nclouds. Marius, at nightfall, was pursuing the same road as on the\npreceding evening, with the same thoughts of delight in his heart, when\nhe caught sight of Éponine approaching, through the trees of the\nboulevard. Two days in succession—this was too much. He turned hastily\naside, quitted the boulevard, changed his course and went to the Rue\nPlumet through the Rue Monsieur.\n\nThis caused Éponine to follow him to the Rue Plumet, a thing which she\nhad not yet done. Up to that time, she had contented herself with\nwatching him on his passage along the boulevard without ever seeking to\nencounter him. It was only on the evening before that she had attempted\nto address him.\n\nSo Éponine followed him, without his suspecting the fact. She saw him\ndisplace the bar and slip into the garden.\n\nShe approached the railing, felt of the bars one after the other, and\nreadily recognized the one which Marius had moved.\n\nShe murmured in a low voice and in gloomy accents:—\n\n“None of that, Lisette!”\n\n\nShe seated herself on the underpinning of the railing, close beside the\nbar, as though she were guarding it. It was precisely at the point\nwhere the railing touched the neighboring wall. There was a dim nook\nthere, in which Éponine was entirely concealed.\n\nShe remained thus for more than an hour, without stirring and without\nbreathing, a prey to her thoughts.\n\nTowards ten o’clock in the evening, one of the two or three persons who\npassed through the Rue Plumet, an old, belated bourgeois who was making\nhaste to escape from this deserted spot of evil repute, as he skirted\nthe garden railings and reached the angle which it made with the wall,\nheard a dull and threatening voice saying:—\n\n“I’m no longer surprised that he comes here every evening.”\n\n\nThe passer-by cast a glance around him, saw no one, dared not peer into\nthe black niche, and was greatly alarmed. He redoubled his pace.\n\nThis passer-by had reason to make haste, for a very few instants later,\nsix men, who were marching separately and at some distance from each\nother, along the wall, and who might have been taken for a gray patrol,\nentered the Rue Plumet.\n\nThe first to arrive at the garden railing halted, and waited for the\nothers; a second later, all six were reunited.\n\nThese men began to talk in a low voice.\n\n“This is the place,” said one of them.\n\n“Is there a _cab_ [dog] in the garden?” asked another.\n\n“I don’t know. In any case, I have fetched a ball that we’ll make him\neat.”\n\n\n“Have you some putty to break the pane with?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“The railing is old,” interpolated a fifth, who had the voice of a\nventriloquist.\n\n“So much the better,” said the second who had spoken. “It won’t screech\nunder the saw, and it won’t be hard to cut.”\n\n\nThe sixth, who had not yet opened his lips, now began to inspect the\ngate, as Éponine had done an hour earlier, grasping each bar in\nsuccession, and shaking them cautiously.\n\nThus he came to the bar which Marius had loosened. As he was on the\npoint of grasping this bar, a hand emerged abruptly from the darkness,\nfell upon his arm; he felt himself vigorously thrust aside by a push in\nthe middle of his breast, and a hoarse voice said to him, but not\nloudly:—\n\n“There’s a dog.”\n\n\nAt the same moment, he perceived a pale girl standing before him.\n\nThe man underwent that shock which the unexpected always brings. He\nbristled up in hideous wise; nothing is so formidable to behold as\nferocious beasts who are uneasy; their terrified air evokes terror.\n\nHe recoiled and stammered:—\n\n“What jade is this?”\n\n\n“Your daughter.”\n\n\nIt was, in fact, Éponine, who had addressed Thénardier.\n\nAt the apparition of Éponine, the other five, that is to say,\nClaquesous, Guelemer, Babet, Brujon, and Montparnasse had noiselessly\ndrawn near, without precipitation, without uttering a word, with the\nsinister slowness peculiar to these men of the night.\n\nSome indescribable but hideous tools were visible in their hands.\nGuelemer held one of those pairs of curved pincers which prowlers call\n_fanchons_.\n\n“Ah, see here, what are you about there? What do you want with us? Are\nyou crazy?” exclaimed Thénardier, as loudly as one can exclaim and\nstill speak low; “what have you come here to hinder our work for?”\n\n\nÉponine burst out laughing, and threw herself on his neck.\n\n“I am here, little father, because I am here. Isn’t a person allowed to\nsit on the stones nowadays? It’s you who ought not to be here. What\nhave you come here for, since it’s a biscuit? I told Magnon so. There’s\nnothing to be done here. But embrace me, my good little father! It’s a\nlong time since I’ve seen you! So you’re out?”\n\n\nThénardier tried to disentangle himself from Éponine’s arms, and\ngrumbled:—\n\n“That’s good. You’ve embraced me. Yes, I’m out. I’m not in. Now, get\naway with you.”\n\n\nBut Éponine did not release her hold, and redoubled her caresses.\n\n“But how did you manage it, little pa? You must have been very clever\nto get out of that. Tell me about it! And my mother? Where is mother?\nTell me about mamma.”\n\n\nThénardier replied:—\n\n“She’s well. I don’t know, let me alone, and be off, I tell you.”\n\n\n“I won’t go, so there now,” pouted Éponine like a spoiled child; “you\nsend me off, and it’s four months since I saw you, and I’ve hardly had\ntime to kiss you.”\n\n\nAnd she caught her father round the neck again.\n\n“Come, now, this is stupid!” said Babet.\n\n“Make haste!” said Guelemer, “the cops may pass.”\n\n\nThe ventriloquist’s voice repeated his distich:—\n\n“Nous n’ sommes pas le jour de l’an,\n“This isn’t New Year’s day\nA bécoter papa, maman.”\n To peck at pa and ma.”\n \n\nÉponine turned to the five ruffians.\n\n“Why, it’s Monsieur Brujon. Good day, Monsieur Babet. Good day,\nMonsieur Claquesous. Don’t you know me, Monsieur Guelemer? How goes it,\nMontparnasse?”\n\n\n“Yes, they know you!” ejaculated Thénardier. “But good day, good\nevening, sheer off! leave us alone!”\n\n\n“It’s the hour for foxes, not for chickens,” said Montparnasse.\n\n“You see the job we have on hand here,” added Babet.\n\nÉponine caught Montparnasse’s hand.\n\n“Take care,” said he, “you’ll cut yourself, I’ve a knife open.”\n\n\n“My little Montparnasse,” responded Éponine very gently, “you must have\nconfidence in people. I am the daughter of my father, perhaps. Monsieur\nBabet, Monsieur Guelemer, I’m the person who was charged to investigate\nthis matter.”\n\n\nIt is remarkable that Éponine did not talk slang. That frightful tongue\nhad become impossible to her since she had known Marius.\n\nShe pressed in her hand, small, bony, and feeble as that of a skeleton,\nGuelemer’s huge, coarse fingers, and continued:—\n\n“You know well that I’m no fool. Ordinarily, I am believed. I have\nrendered you service on various occasions. Well, I have made inquiries;\nyou will expose yourselves to no purpose, you see. I swear to you that\nthere is nothing in this house.”\n\n\n“There are lone women,” said Guelemer.\n\n“No, the persons have moved away.”\n\n\n“The candles haven’t, anyway!” ejaculated Babet.\n\nAnd he pointed out to Éponine, across the tops of the trees, a light\nwhich was wandering about in the mansard roof of the pavilion. It was\nToussaint, who had stayed up to spread out some linen to dry.\n\nÉponine made a final effort.\n\n“Well,” said she, “they’re very poor folks, and it’s a hovel where\nthere isn’t a sou.”\n\n\n“Go to the devil!” cried Thénardier. “When we’ve turned the house\nupside down and put the cellar at the top and the attic below, we’ll\ntell you what there is inside, and whether it’s francs or sous or\nhalf-farthings.”\n\n\nAnd he pushed her aside with the intention of entering.\n\n“My good friend, Mr. Montparnasse,” said Éponine, “I entreat you, you\nare a good fellow, don’t enter.”\n\n\n“Take care, you’ll cut yourself,” replied Montparnasse.\n\nThénardier resumed in his decided tone:—\n\n“Decamp, my girl, and leave men to their own affairs!”\n\n\nÉponine released Montparnasse’s hand, which she had grasped again, and\nsaid:—\n\n“So you mean to enter this house?”\n\n\n“Rather!” grinned the ventriloquist.\n\nThen she set her back against the gate, faced the six ruffians who were\narmed to the teeth, and to whom the night lent the visages of demons,\nand said in a firm, low voice:—\n\n“Well, I don’t mean that you shall.”\n\n\nThey halted in amazement. The ventriloquist, however, finished his\ngrin. She went on:—\n\n“Friends! Listen well. This is not what you want. Now I’m talking. In\nthe first place, if you enter this garden, if you lay a hand on this\ngate, I’ll scream, I’ll beat on the door, I’ll rouse everybody, I’ll\nhave the whole six of you seized, I’ll call the police.”\n\n\n“She’d do it, too,” said Thénardier in a low tone to Brujon and the\nventriloquist.\n\nShe shook her head and added:—\n\n“Beginning with my father!”\n\n\nThénardier stepped nearer.\n\n“Not so close, my good man!” said she.\n\nHe retreated, growling between his teeth:—\n\n“Why, what’s the matter with her?”\n\n\nAnd he added:—\n\n“Bitch!”\n\n\nShe began to laugh in a terrible way:—\n\n“As you like, but you shall not enter here. I’m not the daughter of a\ndog, since I’m the daughter of a wolf. There are six of you, what\nmatters that to me? You are men. Well, I’m a woman. You don’t frighten\nme. I tell you that you shan’t enter this house, because it doesn’t\nsuit me. If you approach, I’ll bark. I told you, I’m the dog, and I\ndon’t care a straw for you. Go your way, you bore me! Go where you\nplease, but don’t come here, I forbid it! You can use your knives. I’ll\nuse kicks; it’s all the same to me, come on!”\n\n\nShe advanced a pace nearer the ruffians, she was terrible, she burst\nout laughing:—\n\n“Pardine! I’m not afraid. I shall be hungry this summer, and I shall be\ncold this winter. Aren’t they ridiculous, these ninnies of men, to\nthink they can scare a girl! What! Scare? Oh, yes, much! Because you\nhave finical poppets of mistresses who hide under the bed when you put\non a big voice, forsooth! I ain’t afraid of anything, that I ain’t!”\n\n\nShe fastened her intent gaze upon Thénardier and said:—\n\n“Not even of you, father!”\n\n\nThen she continued, as she cast her blood-shot, spectre-like eyes upon\nthe ruffians in turn:—\n\n“What do I care if I’m picked up to-morrow morning on the pavement of\nthe Rue Plumet, killed by the blows of my father’s club, or whether I’m\nfound a year from now in the nets at Saint-Cloud or the Isle of Swans\nin the midst of rotten old corks and drowned dogs?”\n\n\nShe was forced to pause; she was seized by a dry cough, her breath came\nfrom her weak and narrow chest like the death-rattle.\n\nShe resumed:—\n\n“I have only to cry out, and people will come, and then slap, bang!\nThere are six of you; I represent the whole world.”\n\n\nThénardier made a movement towards her.\n\n“Don’t approach!” she cried.\n\nHe halted, and said gently:—\n\n“Well, no; I won’t approach, but don’t speak so loud. So you intend to\nhinder us in our work, my daughter? But we must earn our living all the\nsame. Have you no longer any kind feeling for your father?”\n\n\n“You bother me,” said Éponine.\n\n“But we must live, we must eat—”\n\n\n“Burst!”\n\n\nSo saying, she seated herself on the underpinning of the fence and\nhummed:—\n\n“Mon bras si dodu,            “My arm so plump,\nMa jambe bien faite           My leg well formed,\nEt le temps perdu.”           And time wasted.”\n\n\nShe had set her elbow on her knee and her chin in her hand, and she\nswung her foot with an air of indifference. Her tattered gown permitted\na view of her thin shoulder-blades. The neighboring street lantern\nilluminated her profile and her attitude. Nothing more resolute and\nmore surprising could be seen.\n\nThe six rascals, speechless and gloomy at being held in check by a\ngirl, retreated beneath the shadow cast by the lantern, and held\ncounsel with furious and humiliated shrugs.\n\nIn the meantime she stared at them with a stern but peaceful air.\n\n“There’s something the matter with her,” said Babet. “A reason. Is she\nin love with the dog? It’s a shame to miss this, anyway. Two women, an\nold fellow who lodges in the back-yard, and curtains that ain’t so bad\nat the windows. The old cove must be a Jew. I think the job’s a good\none.”\n\n\n“Well, go in, then, the rest of you,” exclaimed Montparnasse. “Do the\njob. I’ll stay here with the girl, and if she fails us—”\n\n\nHe flashed the knife, which he held open in his hand, in the light of\nthe lantern.\n\nThénardier said not a word, and seemed ready for whatever the rest\npleased.\n\nBrujon, who was somewhat of an oracle, and who had, as the reader\nknows, “put up the job,” had not as yet spoken. He seemed thoughtful.\nHe had the reputation of not sticking at anything, and it was known\nthat he had plundered a police post simply out of bravado. Besides this\nhe made verses and songs, which gave him great authority.\n\nBabet interrogated him:—\n\n“You say nothing, Brujon?”\n\n\nBrujon remained silent an instant longer, then he shook his head in\nvarious ways, and finally concluded to speak:—\n\n“See here; this morning I came across two sparrows fighting, this\nevening I jostled a woman who was quarrelling. All that’s bad. Let’s\nquit.”\n\n\nThey went away.\n\nAs they went, Montparnasse muttered:—\n\n“Never mind! if they had wanted, I’d have cut her throat.”\n\n\nBabet responded\n\n“I wouldn’t. I don’t hit a lady.”\n\n\nAt the corner of the street they halted and exchanged the following\nenigmatical dialogue in a low tone:—\n\n“Where shall we go to sleep to-night?”\n\n\n“Under Pantin [Paris].”\n\n\n“Have you the key to the gate, Thénardier?”\n\n\n“Pardi.”\n\n\nÉponine, who never took her eyes off of them, saw them retreat by the\nroad by which they had come. She rose and began to creep after them\nalong the walls and the houses. She followed them thus as far as the\nboulevard.\n\nThere they parted, and she saw these six men plunge into the gloom,\nwhere they appeared to melt away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—THINGS OF THE NIGHT\n\n\nAfter the departure of the ruffians, the Rue Plumet resumed its\ntranquil, nocturnal aspect. That which had just taken place in this\nstreet would not have astonished a forest. The lofty trees, the copses,\nthe heaths, the branches rudely interlaced, the tall grass, exist in a\nsombre manner; the savage swarming there catches glimpses of sudden\napparitions of the invisible; that which is below man distinguishes,\nthrough the mists, that which is beyond man; and the things of which we\nliving beings are ignorant there meet face to face in the night.\nNature, bristling and wild, takes alarm at certain approaches in which\nshe fancies that she feels the supernatural. The forces of the gloom\nknow each other, and are strangely balanced by each other. Teeth and\nclaws fear what they cannot grasp. Blood-drinking bestiality, voracious\nappetites, hunger in search of prey, the armed instincts of nails and\njaws which have for source and aim the belly, glare and smell out\nuneasily the impassive spectral forms straying beneath a shroud, erect\nin its vague and shuddering robe, and which seem to them to live with a\ndead and terrible life. These brutalities, which are only matter,\nentertain a confused fear of having to deal with the immense obscurity\ncondensed into an unknown being. A black figure barring the way stops\nthe wild beast short. That which emerges from the cemetery intimidates\nand disconcerts that which emerges from the cave; the ferocious fear\nthe sinister; wolves recoil when they encounter a ghoul.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—MARIUS BECOMES PRACTICAL ONCE MORE TO THE EXTENT OF GIVING\nCOSETTE HIS ADDRESS\n\n\nWhile this sort of a dog with a human face was mounting guard over the\ngate, and while the six ruffians were yielding to a girl, Marius was by\nCosette’s side.\n\nNever had the sky been more studded with stars and more charming, the\ntrees more trembling, the odor of the grass more penetrating; never had\nthe birds fallen asleep among the leaves with a sweeter noise; never\nhad all the harmonies of universal serenity responded more thoroughly\nto the inward music of love; never had Marius been more captivated,\nmore happy, more ecstatic.\n\nBut he had found Cosette sad; Cosette had been weeping. Her eyes were\nred.\n\nThis was the first cloud in that wonderful dream.\n\nMarius’ first word had been: “What is the matter?”\n\n\nAnd she had replied: “This.”\n\n\nThen she had seated herself on the bench near the steps, and while he\ntremblingly took his place beside her, she had continued:—\n\n“My father told me this morning to hold myself in readiness, because he\nhas business, and we may go away from here.”\n\n\nMarius shivered from head to foot.\n\nWhen one is at the end of one’s life, to die means to go away; when one\nis at the beginning of it, to go away means to die.\n\nFor the last six weeks, Marius had little by little, slowly, by\ndegrees, taken possession of Cosette each day. As we have already\nexplained, in the case of first love, the soul is taken long before the\nbody; later on, one takes the body long before the soul; sometimes one\ndoes not take the soul at all; the Faublas and the Prudhommes add:\n“Because there is none”; but the sarcasm is, fortunately, a blasphemy.\nSo Marius possessed Cosette, as spirits possess, but he enveloped her\nwith all his soul, and seized her jealously with incredible conviction.\nHe possessed her smile, her breath, her perfume, the profound radiance\nof her blue eyes, the sweetness of her skin when he touched her hand,\nthe charming mark which she had on her neck, all her thoughts.\nTherefore, he possessed all Cosette’s dreams.\n\nHe incessantly gazed at, and he sometimes touched lightly with his\nbreath, the short locks on the nape of her neck, and he declared to\nhimself that there was not one of those short hairs which did not\nbelong to him, Marius. He gazed upon and adored the things that she\nwore, her knot of ribbon, her gloves, her sleeves, her shoes, her\ncuffs, as sacred objects of which he was the master. He dreamed that he\nwas the lord of those pretty shell combs which she wore in her hair,\nand he even said to himself, in confused and suppressed stammerings of\nvoluptuousness which did not make their way to the light, that there\nwas not a ribbon of her gown, not a mesh in her stockings, not a fold\nin her bodice, which was not his. Beside Cosette he felt himself beside\nhis own property, his own thing, his own despot and his slave. It\nseemed as though they had so intermingled their souls, that it would\nhave been impossible to tell them apart had they wished to take them\nback again.—“This is mine.” “No, it is mine.” “I assure you that you\nare mistaken. This is my property.” “What you are taking as your own is\nmyself.”—Marius was something that made a part of Cosette, and Cosette\nwas something which made a part of Marius. Marius felt Cosette within\nhim. To have Cosette, to possess Cosette, this, to him, was not to be\ndistinguished from breathing. It was in the midst of this faith, of\nthis intoxication, of this virgin possession, unprecedented and\nabsolute, of this sovereignty, that these words: “We are going away,”\nfell suddenly, at a blow, and that the harsh voice of reality cried to\nhim: “Cosette is not yours!”\n\n\nMarius awoke. For six weeks Marius had been living, as we have said,\noutside of life; those words, _going away!_ caused him to re-enter it\nharshly.\n\nHe found not a word to say. Cosette merely felt that his hand was very\ncold. She said to him in her turn: “What is the matter?”\n\n\nHe replied in so low a tone that Cosette hardly heard him:—\n\n“I did not understand what you said.”\n\n\nShe began again:—\n\n“This morning my father told me to settle all my little affairs and to\nhold myself in readiness, that he would give me his linen to put in a\ntrunk, that he was obliged to go on a journey, that we were to go away,\nthat it is necessary to have a large trunk for me and a small one for\nhim, and that all is to be ready in a week from now, and that we might\ngo to England.”\n\n\n“But this is outrageous!” exclaimed Marius.\n\nIt is certain, that, at that moment, no abuse of power, no violence,\nnot one of the abominations of the worst tyrants, no action of Busiris,\nof Tiberius, or of Henry VIII., could have equalled this in atrocity,\nin the opinion of Marius; M. Fauchelevent taking his daughter off to\nEngland because he had business there.\n\nHe demanded in a weak voice:—\n\n“And when do you start?”\n\n\n“He did not say when.”\n\n\n“And when shall you return?”\n\n\n“He did not say when.”\n\n\nMarius rose and said coldly:—\n\n“Cosette, shall you go?”\n\n\nCosette turned toward him her beautiful eyes, all filled with anguish,\nand replied in a sort of bewilderment:—\n\n“Where?”\n\n\n“To England. Shall you go?”\n\n\n“Why do you say _you_ to me?”\n\n\n“I ask you whether you will go?”\n\n\n“What do you expect me to do?” she said, clasping her hands.\n\n“So, you will go?”\n\n\n“If my father goes.”\n\n\n“So, you will go?”\n\n\nCosette took Marius’ hand, and pressed it without replying.\n\n“Very well,” said Marius, “then I will go elsewhere.”\n\n\nCosette felt rather than understood the meaning of these words. She\nturned so pale that her face shone white through the gloom. She\nstammered:—\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n\nMarius looked at her, then raised his eyes to heaven, and answered:\n“Nothing.”\n\n\nWhen his eyes fell again, he saw Cosette smiling at him. The smile of a\nwoman whom one loves possesses a visible radiance, even at night.\n\n“How silly we are! Marius, I have an idea.”\n\n\n“What is it?”\n\n\n“If we go away, do you go too! I will tell you where! Come and join me\nwherever I am.”\n\n\nMarius was now a thoroughly roused man. He had fallen back into\nreality. He cried to Cosette:—\n\n“Go away with you! Are you mad? Why, I should have to have money, and I\nhave none! Go to England? But I am in debt now, I owe, I don’t know how\nmuch, more than ten louis to Courfeyrac, one of my friends with whom\nyou are not acquainted! I have an old hat which is not worth three\nfrancs, I have a coat which lacks buttons in front, my shirt is all\nragged, my elbows are torn, my boots let in the water; for the last six\nweeks I have not thought about it, and I have not told you about it.\nYou only see me at night, and you give me your love; if you were to see\nme in the daytime, you would give me a sou! Go to England! Eh! I\nhaven’t enough to pay for a passport!”\n\n\nHe threw himself against a tree which was close at hand, erect, his\nbrow pressed close to the bark, feeling neither the wood which flayed\nhis skin, nor the fever which was throbbing in his temples, and there\nhe stood motionless, on the point of falling, like the statue of\ndespair.\n\nHe remained a long time thus. One could remain for eternity in such\nabysses. At last he turned round. He heard behind him a faint stifled\nnoise, which was sweet yet sad.\n\nIt was Cosette sobbing.\n\nShe had been weeping for more than two hours beside Marius as he\nmeditated.\n\nHe came to her, fell at her knees, and slowly prostrating himself, he\ntook the tip of her foot which peeped out from beneath her robe, and\nkissed it.\n\nShe let him have his way in silence. There are moments when a woman\naccepts, like a sombre and resigned goddess, the religion of love.\n\n“Do not weep,” he said.\n\nShe murmured:—\n\n“Not when I may be going away, and you cannot come!”\n\n\nHe went on:—\n\n“Do you love me?”\n\n\nShe replied, sobbing, by that word from paradise which is never more\ncharming than amid tears:—\n\n“I adore you!”\n\n\nHe continued in a tone which was an indescribable caress:—\n\n“Do not weep. Tell me, will you do this for me, and cease to weep?”\n\n\n“Do you love me?” said she.\n\nHe took her hand.\n\n“Cosette, I have never given my word of honor to any one, because my\nword of honor terrifies me. I feel that my father is by my side. Well,\nI give you my most sacred word of honor, that if you go away I shall\ndie.”\n\n\nIn the tone with which he uttered these words there lay a melancholy so\nsolemn and so tranquil, that Cosette trembled. She felt that chill\nwhich is produced by a true and gloomy thing as it passes by. The shock\nmade her cease weeping.\n\n“Now, listen,” said he, “do not expect me to-morrow.”\n\n\n“Why?”\n\n\n“Do not expect me until the day after to-morrow.”\n\n\n“Oh! Why?”\n\n\n“You will see.”\n\n\n“A day without seeing you! But that is impossible!”\n\n\n“Let us sacrifice one day in order to gain our whole lives, perhaps.”\n\n\nAnd Marius added in a low tone and in an aside:—\n\n“He is a man who never changes his habits, and he has never received\nany one except in the evening.”\n\n\n“Of what man are you speaking?” asked Cosette.\n\n“I? I said nothing.”\n\n\n“What do you hope, then?”\n\n\n“Wait until the day after to-morrow.”\n\n\n“You wish it?”\n\n\n“Yes, Cosette.”\n\n\nShe took his head in both her hands, raising herself on tiptoe in order\nto be on a level with him, and tried to read his hope in his eyes.\n\nMarius resumed:—\n\n“Now that I think of it, you ought to know my address: something might\nhappen, one never knows; I live with that friend named Courfeyrac, Rue\nde la Verrerie, No. 16.”\n\n\nHe searched in his pocket, pulled out his penknife, and with the blade\nhe wrote on the plaster of the wall:—\n\n_“16 Rue de la Verrerie.”_\n\nIn the meantime, Cosette had begun to gaze into his eyes once more.\n\n“Tell me your thought, Marius; you have some idea. Tell it to me. Oh!\ntell me, so that I may pass a pleasant night.”\n\n\n“This is my idea: that it is impossible that God should mean to part\nus. Wait; expect me the day after to-morrow.”\n\n\n“What shall I do until then?” said Cosette. “You are outside, you go,\nand come! How happy men are! I shall remain entirely alone! Oh! How sad\nI shall be! What is it that you are going to do to-morrow evening? tell\nme.”\n\n\n“I am going to try something.”\n\n\n“Then I will pray to God and I will think of you here, so that you may\nbe successful. I will question you no further, since you do not wish\nit. You are my master. I shall pass the evening to-morrow in singing\nthat music from _Euryanthe_ that you love, and that you came one\nevening to listen to, outside my shutters. But day after to-morrow you\nwill come early. I shall expect you at dusk, at nine o’clock precisely,\nI warn you. Mon Dieu! how sad it is that the days are so long! On the\nstroke of nine, do you understand, I shall be in the garden.”\n\n\n“And I also.”\n\n\nAnd without having uttered it, moved by the same thought, impelled by\nthose electric currents which place lovers in continual communication,\nboth being intoxicated with delight even in their sorrow, they fell\ninto each other’s arms, without perceiving that their lips met while\ntheir uplifted eyes, overflowing with rapture and full of tears, gazed\nupon the stars.\n\nWhen Marius went forth, the street was deserted. This was the moment\nwhen Éponine was following the ruffians to the boulevard.\n\nWhile Marius had been dreaming with his head pressed to the tree, an\nidea had crossed his mind; an idea, alas! that he himself judged to be\nsenseless and impossible. He had come to a desperate decision.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—THE OLD HEART AND THE YOUNG HEART IN THE PRESENCE OF EACH\nOTHER\n\n\nAt that epoch, Father Gillenormand was well past his ninety-first\nbirthday. He still lived with Mademoiselle Gillenormand in the Rue des\nFilles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the old house which he owned. He was, as\nthe reader will remember, one of those antique old men who await death\nperfectly erect, whom age bears down without bending, and whom even\nsorrow cannot curve.\n\nStill, his daughter had been saying for some time: “My father is\nsinking.” He no longer boxed the maids’ ears; he no longer thumped the\nlanding-place so vigorously with his cane when Basque was slow in\nopening the door. The Revolution of July had exasperated him for the\nspace of barely six months. He had viewed, almost tranquilly, that\ncoupling of words, in the _Moniteur:_ M. Humblot-Conté, peer of France.\nThe fact is, that the old man was deeply dejected. He did not bend, he\ndid not yield; this was no more a characteristic of his physical than\nof his moral nature, but he felt himself giving way internally. For\nfour years he had been waiting for Marius, with his foot firmly\nplanted, that is the exact word, in the conviction that that\ngood-for-nothing young scamp would ring at his door some day or other;\nnow he had reached the point, where, at certain gloomy hours, he said\nto himself, that if Marius made him wait much longer—It was not death\nthat was insupportable to him; it was the idea that perhaps he should\nnever see Marius again. The idea of never seeing Marius again had never\nentered his brain until that day; now the thought began to recur to\nhim, and it chilled him. Absence, as is always the case in genuine and\nnatural sentiments, had only served to augment the grandfather’s love\nfor the ungrateful child, who had gone off like a flash. It is during\nDecember nights, when the cold stands at ten degrees, that one thinks\noftenest of the son.\n\nM. Gillenormand was, or thought himself, above all things, incapable of\ntaking a single step, he—the grandfather, towards his grandson; “I\nwould die rather,” he said to himself. He did not consider himself as\nthe least to blame; but he thought of Marius only with profound\ntenderness, and the mute despair of an elderly, kindly old man who is\nabout to vanish in the dark.\n\nHe began to lose his teeth, which added to his sadness.\n\nM. Gillenormand, without however acknowledging it to himself, for it\nwould have rendered him furious and ashamed, had never loved a mistress\nas he loved Marius.\n\nHe had had placed in his chamber, opposite the head of his bed, so that\nit should be the first thing on which his eyes fell on waking, an old\nportrait of his other daughter, who was dead, Madame Pontmercy, a\nportrait which had been taken when she was eighteen. He gazed\nincessantly at that portrait. One day, he happened to say, as he gazed\nupon it:—\n\n“I think the likeness is strong.”\n\n\n“To my sister?” inquired Mademoiselle Gillenormand. “Yes, certainly.”\n\n\nThe old man added:—\n\n“And to him also.”\n\n\nOnce as he sat with his knees pressed together, and his eyes almost\nclosed, in a despondent attitude, his daughter ventured to say to him:—\n\n“Father, are you as angry with him as ever?”\n\n\nShe paused, not daring to proceed further.\n\n“With whom?” he demanded.\n\n“With that poor Marius.”\n\n\nHe raised his aged head, laid his withered and emaciated fist on the\ntable, and exclaimed in his most irritated and vibrating tone:—\n\n“Poor Marius, do you say! That gentleman is a knave, a wretched\nscoundrel, a vain little ingrate, a heartless, soulless, haughty, and\nwicked man!”\n\n\nAnd he turned away so that his daughter might not see the tear that\nstood in his eye.\n\nThree days later he broke a silence which had lasted four hours, to say\nto his daughter point-blank:—\n\n“I had the honor to ask Mademoiselle Gillenormand never to mention him\nto me.”\n\n\nAunt Gillenormand renounced every effort, and pronounced this acute\ndiagnosis: “My father never cared very much for my sister after her\nfolly. It is clear that he detests Marius.”\n\n\n“After her folly” meant: “after she had married the colonel.”\n\n\nHowever, as the reader has been able to conjecture, Mademoiselle\nGillenormand had failed in her attempt to substitute her favorite, the\nofficer of lancers, for Marius. The substitute, Théodule, had not been\na success. M. Gillenormand had not accepted the _quid pro quo_. A\nvacancy in the heart does not accommodate itself to a stop-gap.\nThéodule, on his side, though he scented the inheritance, was disgusted\nat the task of pleasing. The goodman bored the lancer; and the lancer\nshocked the goodman. Lieutenant Théodule was gay, no doubt, but a\nchatter-box, frivolous, but vulgar; a high liver, but a frequenter of\nbad company; he had mistresses, it is true, and he had a great deal to\nsay about them, it is true also; but he talked badly. All his good\nqualities had a defect. M. Gillenormand was worn out with hearing him\ntell about the love affairs that he had in the vicinity of the barracks\nin the Rue de Babylone. And then, Lieutenant Gillenormand sometimes\ncame in his uniform, with the tricolored cockade. This rendered him\ndownright intolerable. Finally, Father Gillenormand had said to his\ndaughter: “I’ve had enough of that Théodule. I haven’t much taste for\nwarriors in time of peace. Receive him if you choose. I don’t know but\nI prefer slashers to fellows that drag their swords. The clash of\nblades in battle is less dismal, after all, than the clank of the\nscabbard on the pavement. And then, throwing out your chest like a\nbully and lacing yourself like a girl, with stays under your cuirass,\nis doubly ridiculous. When one is a veritable man, one holds equally\naloof from swagger and from affected airs. He is neither a blusterer\nnor a finnicky-hearted man. Keep your Théodule for yourself.”\n\n\nIt was in vain that his daughter said to him: “But he is your\ngrandnephew, nevertheless,”—it turned out that M. Gillenormand, who was\na grandfather to the very finger-tips, was not in the least a\ngrand-uncle.\n\nIn fact, as he had good sense, and as he had compared the two, Théodule\nhad only served to make him regret Marius all the more.\n\nOne evening,—it was the 24th of June, which did not prevent Father\nGillenormand having a rousing fire on the hearth,—he had dismissed his\ndaughter, who was sewing in a neighboring apartment. He was alone in\nhis chamber, amid its pastoral scenes, with his feet propped on the\nandirons, half enveloped in his huge screen of coromandel lacquer, with\nits nine leaves, with his elbow resting on a table where burned two\ncandles under a green shade, engulfed in his tapestry armchair, and in\nhis hand a book which he was not reading. He was dressed, according to\nhis wont, like an _incroyable_, and resembled an antique portrait by\nGarat. This would have made people run after him in the street, had not\nhis daughter covered him up, whenever he went out, in a vast bishop’s\nwadded cloak, which concealed his attire. At home, he never wore a\ndressing gown, except when he rose and retired. “It gives one a look of\nage,” said he.\n\nFather Gillenormand was thinking of Marius lovingly and bitterly; and,\nas usual, bitterness predominated. His tenderness once soured always\nended by boiling and turning to indignation. He had reached the point\nwhere a man tries to make up his mind and to accept that which rends\nhis heart. He was explaining to himself that there was no longer any\nreason why Marius should return, that if he intended to return, he\nshould have done it long ago, that he must renounce the idea. He was\ntrying to accustom himself to the thought that all was over, and that\nhe should die without having beheld “that gentleman” again. But his\nwhole nature revolted; his aged paternity would not consent to this.\n“Well!” said he,—this was his doleful refrain,—“he will not return!”\nHis bald head had fallen upon his breast, and he fixed a melancholy and\nirritated gaze upon the ashes on his hearth.\n\nIn the very midst of his reverie, his old servant Basque entered, and\ninquired:—\n\n“Can Monsieur receive M. Marius?”\n\n\nThe old man sat up erect, pallid, and like a corpse which rises under\nthe influence of a galvanic shock. All his blood had retreated to his\nheart. He stammered:—\n\n“M. Marius what?”\n\n\n“I don’t know,” replied Basque, intimidated and put out of countenance\nby his master’s air; “I have not seen him. Nicolette came in and said\nto me: ‘There’s a young man here; say that it is M. Marius.’”\n\n\nFather Gillenormand stammered in a low voice:—\n\n“Show him in.”\n\n\nAnd he remained in the same attitude, with shaking head, and his eyes\nfixed on the door. It opened once more. A young man entered. It was\nMarius.\n\nMarius halted at the door, as though waiting to be bidden to enter.\n\nHis almost squalid attire was not perceptible in the obscurity caused\nby the shade. Nothing could be seen but his calm, grave, but strangely\nsad face.\n\nIt was several minutes before Father Gillenormand, dulled with\namazement and joy, could see anything except a brightness as when one\nis in the presence of an apparition. He was on the point of swooning;\nhe saw Marius through a dazzling light. It certainly was he, it\ncertainly was Marius.\n\nAt last! After the lapse of four years! He grasped him entire, so to\nspeak, in a single glance. He found him noble, handsome, distinguished,\nwell-grown, a complete man, with a suitable mien and a charming air. He\nfelt a desire to open his arms, to call him, to fling himself forward;\nhis heart melted with rapture, affectionate words swelled and\noverflowed his breast; at length all his tenderness came to the light\nand reached his lips, and, by a contrast which constituted the very\nfoundation of his nature, what came forth was harshness. He said\nabruptly:—\n\n“What have you come here for?”\n\n\nMarius replied with embarrassment:—\n\n“Monsieur—”\n\n\nM. Gillenormand would have liked to have Marius throw himself into his\narms. He was displeased with Marius and with himself. He was conscious\nthat he was brusque, and that Marius was cold. It caused the goodman\nunendurable and irritating anxiety to feel so tender and forlorn\nwithin, and only to be able to be hard outside. Bitterness returned. He\ninterrupted Marius in a peevish tone:—\n\n“Then why did you come?”\n\n\nThat “then” signified: _If you do not come to embrace me_. Marius\nlooked at his grandfather, whose pallor gave him a face of marble.\n\n“Monsieur—”\n\n\n“Have you come to beg my pardon? Do you acknowledge your faults?”\n\n\nHe thought he was putting Marius on the right road, and that “the\nchild” would yield. Marius shivered; it was the denial of his father\nthat was required of him; he dropped his eyes and replied:—\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n\n“Then,” exclaimed the old man impetuously, with a grief that was\npoignant and full of wrath, “what do you want of me?”\n\n\nMarius clasped his hands, advanced a step, and said in a feeble and\ntrembling voice:—\n\n“Sir, have pity on me.”\n\n\nThese words touched M. Gillenormand; uttered a little sooner, they\nwould have rendered him tender, but they came too late. The grandfather\nrose; he supported himself with both hands on his cane; his lips were\nwhite, his brow wavered, but his lofty form towered above Marius as he\nbowed.\n\n“Pity on you, sir! It is youth demanding pity of the old man of\nninety-one! You are entering into life, I am leaving it; you go to the\nplay, to balls, to the café, to the billiard-hall; you have wit, you\nplease the women, you are a handsome fellow; as for me, I spit on my\nbrands in the heart of summer; you are rich with the only riches that\nare really such, I possess all the poverty of age; infirmity,\nisolation! You have your thirty-two teeth, a good digestion, bright\neyes, strength, appetite, health, gayety, a forest of black hair; I\nhave no longer even white hair, I have lost my teeth, I am losing my\nlegs, I am losing my memory; there are three names of streets that I\nconfound incessantly, the Rue Charlot, the Rue du Chaume, and the Rue\nSaint-Claude, that is what I have come to; you have before you the\nwhole future, full of sunshine, and I am beginning to lose my sight, so\nfar am I advancing into the night; you are in love, that is a matter of\ncourse, I am beloved by no one in all the world; and you ask pity of\nme! Parbleu! Molière forgot that. If that is the way you jest at the\ncourthouse, Messieurs the lawyers, I sincerely compliment you. You are\ndroll.”\n\n\nAnd the octogenarian went on in a grave and angry voice:—\n\n“Come, now, what do you want of me?”\n\n\n“Sir,” said Marius, “I know that my presence is displeasing to you, but\nI have come merely to ask one thing of you, and then I shall go away\nimmediately.”\n\n\n“You are a fool!” said the old man. “Who said that you were to go\naway?”\n\n\nThis was the translation of the tender words which lay at the bottom of\nhis heart:—\n\n“Ask my pardon! Throw yourself on my neck!”\n\n\nM. Gillenormand felt that Marius would leave him in a few moments, that\nhis harsh reception had repelled the lad, that his hardness was driving\nhim away; he said all this to himself, and it augmented his grief; and\nas his grief was straightway converted into wrath, it increased his\nharshness. He would have liked to have Marius understand, and Marius\ndid not understand, which made the goodman furious.\n\nHe began again:—\n\n“What! you deserted me, your grandfather, you left my house to go no\none knows whither, you drove your aunt to despair, you went off, it is\neasily guessed, to lead a bachelor life; it’s more convenient, to play\nthe dandy, to come in at all hours, to amuse yourself; you have given\nme no signs of life, you have contracted debts without even telling me\nto pay them, you have become a smasher of windows and a blusterer, and,\nat the end of four years, you come to me, and that is all you have to\nsay to me!”\n\n\nThis violent fashion of driving a grandson to tenderness was productive\nonly of silence on the part of Marius. M. Gillenormand folded his arms;\na gesture which with him was peculiarly imperious, and apostrophized\nMarius bitterly:—\n\n“Let us make an end of this. You have come to ask something of me, you\nsay? Well, what? What is it? Speak!”\n\n\n“Sir,” said Marius, with the look of a man who feels that he is falling\nover a precipice, “I have come to ask your permission to marry.”\n\n\nM. Gillenormand rang the bell. Basque opened the door half-way.\n\n“Call my daughter.”\n\n\nA second later, the door was opened once more, Mademoiselle\nGillenormand did not enter, but showed herself; Marius was standing,\nmute, with pendant arms and the face of a criminal; M. Gillenormand was\npacing back and forth in the room. He turned to his daughter and said\nto her:—\n\n“Nothing. It is Monsieur Marius. Say good day to him. Monsieur wishes\nto marry. That’s all. Go away.”\n\n\nThe curt, hoarse sound of the old man’s voice announced a strange\ndegree of excitement. The aunt gazed at Marius with a frightened air,\nhardly appeared to recognize him, did not allow a gesture or a syllable\nto escape her, and disappeared at her father’s breath more swiftly than\na straw before the hurricane.\n\nIn the meantime, Father Gillenormand had returned and placed his back\nagainst the chimney-piece once more.\n\n“You marry! At one and twenty! You have arranged that! You have only a\npermission to ask! a formality. Sit down, sir. Well, you have had a\nrevolution since I had the honor to see you last. The Jacobins got the\nupper hand. You must have been delighted. Are you not a Republican\nsince you are a Baron? You can make that agree. The Republic makes a\ngood sauce for the barony. Are you one of those decorated by July? Have\nyou taken the Louvre at all, sir? Quite near here, in the Rue\nSaint-Antoine, opposite the Rue des Nonamdières, there is a cannon-ball\nincrusted in the wall of the third story of a house with this\ninscription: ‘July 28th, 1830.’ Go take a look at that. It produces a\ngood effect. Ah! those friends of yours do pretty things. By the way,\naren’t they erecting a fountain in the place of the monument of M. le\nDuc de Berry? So you want to marry? Whom? Can one inquire without\nindiscretion?”\n\n\nHe paused, and, before Marius had time to answer, he added violently:—\n\n“Come now, you have a profession? A fortune made? How much do you earn\nat your trade of lawyer?”\n\n\n“Nothing,” said Marius, with a sort of firmness and resolution that was\nalmost fierce.\n\n“Nothing? Then all that you have to live upon is the twelve hundred\nlivres that I allow you?”\n\n\nMarius did not reply. M. Gillenormand continued:—\n\n“Then I understand the girl is rich?”\n\n\n“As rich as I am.”\n\n\n“What! No dowry?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“Expectations?”\n\n\n“I think not.”\n\n\n“Utterly naked! What’s the father?”\n\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n\n“And what’s her name?”\n\n\n“Mademoiselle Fauchelevent.”\n\n\n“Fauchewhat?”\n\n\n“Fauchelevent.”\n\n\n“Pttt!” ejaculated the old gentleman.\n\n“Sir!” exclaimed Marius.\n\nM. Gillenormand interrupted him with the tone of a man who is speaking\nto himself:—\n\n“That’s right, one and twenty years of age, no profession, twelve\nhundred livres a year, Madame la Baronne de Pontmercy will go and\npurchase a couple of sous’ worth of parsley from the fruiterer.”\n\n\n“Sir,” repeated Marius, in the despair at the last hope, which was\nvanishing, “I entreat you! I conjure you in the name of Heaven, with\nclasped hands, sir, I throw myself at your feet, permit me to marry\nher!”\n\n\nThe old man burst into a shout of strident and mournful laughter,\ncoughing and laughing at the same time.\n\n“Ah! ah! ah! You said to yourself: ‘Pardine! I’ll go hunt up that old\nblockhead, that absurd numskull! What a shame that I’m not twenty-five!\nHow I’d treat him to a nice respectful summons! How nicely I’d get\nalong without him! It’s nothing to me, I’d say to him: “You’re only too\nhappy to see me, you old idiot, I want to marry, I desire to wed\nMamselle No-matter-whom, daughter of Monsieur No-matter-what, I have no\nshoes, she has no chemise, that just suits; I want to throw my career,\nmy future, my youth, my life to the dogs; I wish to take a plunge into\nwretchedness with a woman around my neck, that’s an idea, and you must\nconsent to it!” and the old fossil will consent.’ Go, my lad, do as you\nlike, attach your paving-stone, marry your Pousselevent, your\nCoupelevent—Never, sir, never!”\n\n\n“Father—”\n\n\n“Never!”\n\n\nAt the tone in which that “never” was uttered, Marius lost all hope. He\ntraversed the chamber with slow steps, with bowed head, tottering and\nmore like a dying man than like one merely taking his departure. M.\nGillenormand followed him with his eyes, and at the moment when the\ndoor opened, and Marius was on the point of going out, he advanced four\npaces, with the senile vivacity of impetuous and spoiled old gentlemen,\nseized Marius by the collar, brought him back energetically into the\nroom, flung him into an armchair and said to him:—\n\n“Tell me all about it!”\n\n\n“It was that single word “father” which had effected this revolution.\n\nMarius stared at him in bewilderment. M. Gillenormand’s mobile face was\nno longer expressive of anything but rough and ineffable good-nature.\nThe grandsire had given way before the grandfather.\n\n“Come, see here, speak, tell me about your love affairs, jabber, tell\nme everything! Sapristi! how stupid young folks are!”\n\n\n“Father—” repeated Marius.\n\nThe old man’s entire countenance lighted up with indescribable\nradiance.\n\n“Yes, that’s right, call me father, and you’ll see!”\n\n\nThere was now something so kind, so gentle, so openhearted, and so\npaternal in this brusqueness, that Marius, in the sudden transition\nfrom discouragement to hope, was stunned and intoxicated by it, as it\nwere. He was seated near the table, the light from the candles brought\nout the dilapidation of his costume, which Father Gillenormand regarded\nwith amazement.\n\n“Well, father—” said Marius.\n\n“Ah, by the way,” interrupted M. Gillenormand, “you really have not a\npenny then? You are dressed like a pickpocket.”\n\n\nHe rummaged in a drawer, drew forth a purse, which he laid on the\ntable: “Here are a hundred louis, buy yourself a hat.”\n\n\n“Father,” pursued Marius, “my good father, if you only knew! I love\nher. You cannot imagine it; the first time I saw her was at the\nLuxembourg, she came there; in the beginning, I did not pay much heed\nto her, and then, I don’t know how it came about, I fell in love with\nher. Oh! how unhappy that made me! Now, at last, I see her every day,\nat her own home, her father does not know it, just fancy, they are\ngoing away, it is in the garden that we meet, in the evening, her\nfather means to take her to England, then I said to myself: ‘I’ll go\nand see my grandfather and tell him all about the affair. I should go\nmad first, I should die, I should fall ill, I should throw myself into\nthe water. I absolutely must marry her, since I should go mad\notherwise.’ This is the whole truth, and I do not think that I have\nomitted anything. She lives in a garden with an iron fence, in the Rue\nPlumet. It is in the neighborhood of the Invalides.”\n\n\nFather Gillenormand had seated himself, with a beaming countenance,\nbeside Marius. As he listened to him and drank in the sound of his\nvoice, he enjoyed at the same time a protracted pinch of snuff. At the\nwords “Rue Plumet” he interrupted his inhalation and allowed the\nremainder of his snuff to fall upon his knees.\n\n“The Rue Plumet, the Rue Plumet, did you say?—Let us see!—Are there not\nbarracks in that vicinity?—Why, yes, that’s it. Your cousin Théodule\nhas spoken to me about it. The lancer, the officer. A gay girl, my good\nfriend, a gay girl!—Pardieu, yes, the Rue Plumet. It is what used to be\ncalled the Rue Blomet.—It all comes back to me now. I have heard of\nthat little girl of the iron railing in the Rue Plumet. In a garden, a\nPamela. Your taste is not bad. She is said to be a very tidy creature.\nBetween ourselves, I think that simpleton of a lancer has been courting\nher a bit. I don’t know where he did it. However, that’s not to the\npurpose. Besides, he is not to be believed. He brags, Marius! I think\nit quite proper that a young man like you should be in love. It’s the\nright thing at your age. I like you better as a lover than as a\nJacobin. I like you better in love with a petticoat, sapristi! with\ntwenty petticoats, than with M. de Robespierre. For my part, I will do\nmyself the justice to say, that in the line of _sans-culottes_, I have\nnever loved any one but women. Pretty girls are pretty girls, the\ndeuce! There’s no objection to that. As for the little one, she\nreceives you without her father’s knowledge. That’s in the established\norder of things. I have had adventures of that same sort myself. More\nthan one. Do you know what is done then? One does not take the matter\nferociously; one does not precipitate himself into the tragic; one does\nnot make one’s mind to marriage and M. le Maire with his scarf. One\nsimply behaves like a fellow of spirit. One shows good sense. Slip\nalong, mortals; don’t marry. You come and look up your grandfather, who\nis a good-natured fellow at bottom, and who always has a few rolls of\nlouis in an old drawer; you say to him: ‘See here, grandfather.’ And\nthe grandfather says: ‘That’s a simple matter. Youth must amuse itself,\nand old age must wear out. I have been young, you will be old. Come, my\nboy, you shall pass it on to your grandson. Here are two hundred\npistoles. Amuse yourself, deuce take it!’ Nothing better! That’s the\nway the affair should be treated. You don’t marry, but that does no\nharm. You understand me?”\n\n\nMarius, petrified and incapable of uttering a syllable, made a sign\nwith his head that he did not.\n\nThe old man burst out laughing, winked his aged eye, gave him a slap on\nthe knee, stared him full in the face with a mysterious and beaming\nair, and said to him, with the tenderest of shrugs of the shoulder:—\n\n“Booby! make her your mistress.”\n\n\nMarius turned pale. He had understood nothing of what his grandfather\nhad just said. This twaddle about the Rue Blomet, Pamela, the barracks,\nthe lancer, had passed before Marius like a dissolving view. Nothing of\nall that could bear any reference to Cosette, who was a lily. The good\nman was wandering in his mind. But this wandering terminated in words\nwhich Marius did understand, and which were a mortal insult to Cosette.\nThose words, “make her your mistress,” entered the heart of the strict\nyoung man like a sword.\n\nHe rose, picked up his hat which lay on the floor, and walked to the\ndoor with a firm, assured step. There he turned round, bowed deeply to\nhis grandfather, raised his head erect again, and said:—\n\n“Five years ago you insulted my father; to-day you have insulted my\nwife. I ask nothing more of you, sir. Farewell.”\n\n\nFather Gillenormand, utterly confounded, opened his mouth, extended his\narms, tried to rise, and before he could utter a word, the door closed\nonce more, and Marius had disappeared.\n\nThe old man remained for several minutes motionless and as though\nstruck by lightning, without the power to speak or breathe, as though a\nclenched fist grasped his throat. At last he tore himself from his\narmchair, ran, so far as a man can run at ninety-one, to the door,\nopened it, and cried:—\n\n“Help! Help!”\n\n\nHis daughter made her appearance, then the domestics. He began again,\nwith a pitiful rattle: “Run after him! Bring him back! What have I done\nto him? He is mad! He is going away! Ah! my God! Ah! my God! This time\nhe will not come back!”\n\n\nHe went to the window which looked out on the street, threw it open\nwith his aged and palsied hands, leaned out more than half-way, while\nBasque and Nicolette held him behind, and shouted:—\n\n“Marius! Marius! Marius! Marius!”\n\n\nBut Marius could no longer hear him, for at that moment he was turning\nthe corner of the Rue Saint-Louis.\n\nThe octogenarian raised his hands to his temples two or three times\nwith an expression of anguish, recoiled tottering, and fell back into\nan armchair, pulseless, voiceless, tearless, with quivering head and\nlips which moved with a stupid air, with nothing in his eyes and\nnothing any longer in his heart except a gloomy and profound something\nwhich resembled night.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK NINTH—WHITHER ARE THEY GOING?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—JEAN VALJEAN\n\n\nThat same day, towards four o’clock in the afternoon, Jean Valjean was\nsitting alone on the back side of one of the most solitary slopes in\nthe Champ-de-Mars. Either from prudence, or from a desire to meditate,\nor simply in consequence of one of those insensible changes of habit\nwhich gradually introduce themselves into the existence of every one,\nhe now rarely went out with Cosette. He had on his workman’s waistcoat,\nand trousers of gray linen; and his long-visored cap concealed his\ncountenance.\n\nHe was calm and happy now beside Cosette; that which had, for a time,\nalarmed and troubled him had been dissipated; but for the last week or\ntwo, anxieties of another nature had come up. One day, while walking on\nthe boulevard, he had caught sight of Thénardier; thanks to his\ndisguise, Thénardier had not recognized him; but since that day, Jean\nValjean had seen him repeatedly, and he was now certain that Thénardier\nwas prowling about in their neighborhood.\n\nThis had been sufficient to make him come to a decision.\n\nMoreover, Paris was not tranquil: political troubles presented this\ninconvenient feature, for any one who had anything to conceal in his\nlife, that the police had grown very uneasy and very suspicious, and\nthat while seeking to ferret out a man like Pépin or Morey, they might\nvery readily discover a man like Jean Valjean.\n\nJean Valjean had made up his mind to quit Paris, and even France, and\ngo over to England.\n\nHe had warned Cosette. He wished to set out before the end of the week.\n\nHe had seated himself on the slope in the Champ-de-Mars, turning over\nall sorts of thoughts in his mind,—Thénardier, the police, the journey,\nand the difficulty of procuring a passport.\n\nHe was troubled from all these points of view.\n\nLast of all, an inexplicable circumstance which had just attracted his\nattention, and from which he had not yet recovered, had added to his\nstate of alarm.\n\nOn the morning of that very day, when he alone of the household was\nstirring, while strolling in the garden before Cosette’s shutters were\nopen, he had suddenly perceived on the wall, the following line,\nengraved, probably with a nail:—\n\n_16 Rue de la Verrerie_.\n\nThis was perfectly fresh, the grooves in the ancient black mortar were\nwhite, a tuft of nettles at the foot of the wall was powdered with the\nfine, fresh plaster.\n\nThis had probably been written on the preceding night.\n\nWhat was this? A signal for others? A warning for himself?\n\nIn any case, it was evident that the garden had been violated, and that\nstrangers had made their way into it.\n\nHe recalled the odd incidents which had already alarmed the household.\n\nHis mind was now filling in this canvas.\n\nHe took good care not to speak to Cosette of the line written on the\nwall, for fear of alarming her.\n\nIn the midst of his preoccupations, he perceived, from a shadow cast by\nthe sun, that some one had halted on the crest of the slope immediately\nbehind him.\n\nHe was on the point of turning round, when a paper folded in four fell\nupon his knees as though a hand had dropped it over his head.\n\nHe took the paper, unfolded it, and read these words written in large\ncharacters, with a pencil:—\n\n“MOVE AWAY FROM YOUR HOUSE.”\n\n\nJean Valjean sprang hastily to his feet; there was no one on the slope;\nhe gazed all around him and perceived a creature larger than a child,\nnot so large as a man, clad in a gray blouse and trousers of\ndust-colored cotton velvet, who was jumping over the parapet and who\nslipped into the moat of the Champ-de-Mars.\n\nJean Valjean returned home at once, in a very thoughtful mood.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—MARIUS\n\n\nMarius had left M. Gillenormand in despair. He had entered the house\nwith very little hope, and quitted it with immense despair.\n\nHowever, and those who have observed the depths of the human heart will\nunderstand this, the officer, the lancer, the ninny, Cousin Théodule,\nhad left no trace in his mind. Not the slightest. The dramatic poet\nmight, apparently, expect some complications from this revelation made\npoint-blank by the grandfather to the grandson. But what the drama\nwould gain thereby, truth would lose. Marius was at an age when one\nbelieves nothing in the line of evil; later on comes the age when one\nbelieves everything. Suspicions are nothing else than wrinkles. Early\nyouth has none of them. That which overwhelmed Othello glides innocuous\nover Candide. Suspect Cosette! There are hosts of crimes which Marius\ncould sooner have committed.\n\nHe began to wander about the streets, the resource of those who suffer.\nHe thought of nothing, so far as he could afterwards remember. At two\no’clock in the morning he returned to Courfeyrac’s quarters and flung\nhimself, without undressing, on his mattress. The sun was shining\nbrightly when he sank into that frightful leaden slumber which permits\nideas to go and come in the brain. When he awoke, he saw Courfeyrac,\nEnjolras, Feuilly, and Combeferre standing in the room with their hats\non and all ready to go out.\n\nCourfeyrac said to him:—\n\n“Are you coming to General Lamarque’s funeral?”\n\n\nIt seemed to him that Courfeyrac was speaking Chinese.\n\nHe went out some time after them. He put in his pocket the pistols\nwhich Javert had given him at the time of the adventure on the 3d of\nFebruary, and which had remained in his hands. These pistols were still\nloaded. It would be difficult to say what vague thought he had in his\nmind when he took them with him.\n\nAll day long he prowled about, without knowing where he was going; it\nrained at times, he did not perceive it; for his dinner, he purchased a\npenny roll at a baker’s, put it in his pocket and forgot it. It appears\nthat he took a bath in the Seine without being aware of it. There are\nmoments when a man has a furnace within his skull. Marius was passing\nthrough one of those moments. He no longer hoped for anything; this\nstep he had taken since the preceding evening. He waited for night with\nfeverish impatience, he had but one idea clearly before his mind;—this\nwas, that at nine o’clock he should see Cosette. This last happiness\nnow constituted his whole future; after that, gloom. At intervals, as\nhe roamed through the most deserted boulevards, it seemed to him that\nhe heard strange noises in Paris. He thrust his head out of his reverie\nand said: “Is there fighting on hand?”\n\n\nAt nightfall, at nine o’clock precisely, as he had promised Cosette, he\nwas in the Rue Plumet. When he approached the grating he forgot\neverything. It was forty-eight hours since he had seen Cosette; he was\nabout to behold her once more; every other thought was effaced, and he\nfelt only a profound and unheard-of joy. Those minutes in which one\nlives centuries always have this sovereign and wonderful property, that\nat the moment when they are passing they fill the heart completely.\n\nMarius displaced the bar, and rushed headlong into the garden. Cosette\nwas not at the spot where she ordinarily waited for him. He traversed\nthe thicket, and approached the recess near the flight of steps: “She\nis waiting for me there,” said he. Cosette was not there. He raised his\neyes, and saw that the shutters of the house were closed. He made the\ntour of the garden, the garden was deserted. Then he returned to the\nhouse, and, rendered senseless by love, intoxicated, terrified,\nexasperated with grief and uneasiness, like a master who returns home\nat an evil hour, he tapped on the shutters. He knocked and knocked\nagain, at the risk of seeing the window open, and her father’s gloomy\nface make its appearance, and demand: “What do you want?” This was\nnothing in comparison with what he dimly caught a glimpse of. When he\nhad rapped, he lifted up his voice and called Cosette.—“Cosette!” he\ncried; “Cosette!” he repeated imperiously. There was no reply. All was\nover. No one in the garden; no one in the house.\n\nMarius fixed his despairing eyes on that dismal house, which was as\nblack and as silent as a tomb and far more empty. He gazed at the stone\nseat on which he had passed so many adorable hours with Cosette. Then\nhe seated himself on the flight of steps, his heart filled with\nsweetness and resolution, he blessed his love in the depths of his\nthought, and he said to himself that, since Cosette was gone, all that\nthere was left for him was to die.\n\nAll at once he heard a voice which seemed to proceed from the street,\nand which was calling to him through the trees:—\n\n“Mr. Marius!”\n\n\nHe started to his feet.\n\n“Hey?” said he.\n\n“Mr. Marius, are you there?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Mr. Marius,” went on the voice, “your friends are waiting for you at\nthe barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie.”\n\n\nThis voice was not wholly unfamiliar to him. It resembled the hoarse,\nrough voice of Éponine. Marius hastened to the gate, thrust aside the\nmovable bar, passed his head through the aperture, and saw some one who\nappeared to him to be a young man, disappearing at a run into the\ngloom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—M. MABEUF\n\n\nJean Valjean’s purse was of no use to M. Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf, in his\nvenerable, infantile austerity, had not accepted the gift of the stars;\nhe had not admitted that a star could coin itself into louis d’or. He\nhad not divined that what had fallen from heaven had come from\nGavroche. He had taken the purse to the police commissioner of the\nquarter, as a lost article placed by the finder at the disposal of\nclaimants. The purse was actually lost. It is unnecessary to say that\nno one claimed it, and that it did not succor M. Mabeuf.\n\nMoreover, M. Mabeuf had continued his downward course.\n\nHis experiments on indigo had been no more successful in the Jardin des\nPlantes than in his garden at Austerlitz. The year before he had owed\nhis housekeeper’s wages; now, as we have seen, he owed three quarters\nof his rent. The pawnshop had sold the plates of his _Flora_ after the\nexpiration of thirteen months. Some coppersmith had made stewpans of\nthem. His copper plates gone, and being unable to complete even the\nincomplete copies of his _Flora_ which were in his possession, he had\ndisposed of the text, at a miserable price, as waste paper, to a\nsecond-hand bookseller. Nothing now remained to him of his life’s work.\nHe set to work to eat up the money for these copies. When he saw that\nthis wretched resource was becoming exhausted, he gave up his garden\nand allowed it to run to waste. Before this, a long time before, he had\ngiven up his two eggs and the morsel of beef which he ate from time to\ntime. He dined on bread and potatoes. He had sold the last of his\nfurniture, then all duplicates of his bedding, his clothing and his\nblankets, then his herbariums and prints; but he still retained his\nmost precious books, many of which were of the greatest rarity, among\nothers, _Les Quadrins Historiques de la Bible_, edition of 1560; _La\nConcordance des Bibles_, by Pierre de Besse; _Les Marguerites de la\nMarguerite_, of Jean de La Haye, with a dedication to the Queen of\nNavarre; the book _de la Charge et Dignité de l’Ambassadeur_, by the\nSieur de Villiers Hotman; a _Florilegium Rabbinicum_ of 1644; a\n_Tibullus_ of 1567, with this magnificent inscription: _Venetiis, in\nædibus Manutianis_; and lastly, a Diogenes Laertius, printed at Lyons\nin 1644, which contained the famous variant of the manuscript 411,\nthirteenth century, of the Vatican, and those of the two manuscripts of\nVenice, 393 and 394, consulted with such fruitful results by Henri\nEstienne, and all the passages in Doric dialect which are only found in\nthe celebrated manuscript of the twelfth century belonging to the\nNaples Library. M. Mabeuf never had any fire in his chamber, and went\nto bed at sundown, in order not to consume any candles. It seemed as\nthough he had no longer any neighbors: people avoided him when he went\nout; he perceived the fact. The wretchedness of a child interests a\nmother, the wretchedness of a young man interests a young girl, the\nwretchedness of an old man interests no one. It is, of all distresses,\nthe coldest. Still, Father Mabeuf had not entirely lost his childlike\nserenity. His eyes acquired some vivacity when they rested on his\nbooks, and he smiled when he gazed at the Diogenes Laertius, which was\na unique copy. His bookcase with glass doors was the only piece of\nfurniture which he had kept beyond what was strictly indispensable.\n\nOne day, Mother Plutarque said to him:—\n\n“I have no money to buy any dinner.”\n\n\nWhat she called dinner was a loaf of bread and four or five potatoes.\n\n“On credit?” suggested M. Mabeuf.\n\n“You know well that people refuse me.”\n\n\nM. Mabeuf opened his bookcase, took a long look at all his books, one\nafter another, as a father obliged to decimate his children would gaze\nupon them before making a choice, then seized one hastily, put it in\nunder his arm and went out. He returned two hours later, without\nanything under his arm, laid thirty sous on the table, and said:—\n\n“You will get something for dinner.”\n\n\nFrom that moment forth, Mother Plutarque saw a sombre veil, which was\nnever more lifted, descend over the old man’s candid face.\n\nOn the following day, on the day after, and on the day after that, it\nhad to be done again.\n\nM. Mabeuf went out with a book and returned with a coin. As the\nsecond-hand dealers perceived that he was forced to sell, they\npurchased of him for twenty sous that for which he had paid twenty\nfrancs, sometimes at those very shops. Volume by volume, the whole\nlibrary went the same road. He said at times: “But I am eighty;” as\nthough he cherished some secret hope that he should arrive at the end\nof his days before reaching the end of his books. His melancholy\nincreased. Once, however, he had a pleasure. He had gone out with a\nRobert Estienne, which he had sold for thirty-five sous under the Quai\nMalaquais, and he returned with an Aldus which he had bought for forty\nsous in the Rue des Grès.—“I owe five sous,” he said, beaming on Mother\nPlutarque. That day he had no dinner.\n\nHe belonged to the Horticultural Society. His destitution became known\nthere. The president of the society came to see him, promised to speak\nto the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce about him, and did\nso.—“Why, what!” exclaimed the Minister, “I should think so! An old\nsavant! a botanist! an inoffensive man! Something must be done for\nhim!” On the following day, M. Mabeuf received an invitation to dine\nwith the Minister. Trembling with joy, he showed the letter to Mother\nPlutarque. “We are saved!” said he. On the day appointed, he went to\nthe Minister’s house. He perceived that his ragged cravat, his long,\nsquare coat, and his waxed shoes astonished the ushers. No one spoke to\nhim, not even the Minister. About ten o’clock in the evening, while he\nwas still waiting for a word, he heard the Minister’s wife, a beautiful\nwoman in a low-necked gown whom he had not ventured to approach,\ninquire: “Who is that old gentleman?” He returned home on foot at\nmidnight, in a driving rain-storm. He had sold an Elzevir to pay for a\ncarriage in which to go thither.\n\nHe had acquired the habit of reading a few pages in his Diogenes\nLaertius every night, before he went to bed. He knew enough Greek to\nenjoy the peculiarities of the text which he owned. He had now no other\nenjoyment. Several weeks passed. All at once, Mother Plutarque fell\nill. There is one thing sadder than having no money with which to buy\nbread at the baker’s and that is having no money to purchase drugs at\nthe apothecary’s. One evening, the doctor had ordered a very expensive\npotion. And the malady was growing worse; a nurse was required. M.\nMabeuf opened his bookcase; there was nothing there. The last volume\nhad taken its departure. All that was left to him was Diogenes\nLaertius. He put this unique copy under his arm, and went out. It was\nthe 4th of June, 1832; he went to the Porte Saint-Jacques, to Royal’s\nsuccessor, and returned with one hundred francs. He laid the pile of\nfive-franc pieces on the old serving-woman’s nightstand, and returned\nto his chamber without saying a word.\n\nOn the following morning, at dawn, he seated himself on the overturned\npost in his garden, and he could be seen over the top of the hedge,\nsitting the whole morning motionless, with drooping head, his eyes\nvaguely fixed on the withered flower-beds. It rained at intervals; the\nold man did not seem to perceive the fact.\n\nIn the afternoon, extraordinary noises broke out in Paris. They\nresembled shots and the clamors of a multitude.\n\nFather Mabeuf raised his head. He saw a gardener passing, and\ninquired:—\n\n“What is it?”\n\n\nThe gardener, spade on back, replied in the most unconcerned tone:—\n\n“It is the riots.”\n\n\n“What riots?”\n\n\n“Yes, they are fighting.”\n\n\n“Why are they fighting?”\n\n\n“Ah, good Heavens!” ejaculated the gardener.\n\n“In what direction?” went on M. Mabeuf.\n\n“In the neighborhood of the Arsenal.”\n\n\nFather Mabeuf went to his room, took his hat, mechanically sought for a\nbook to place under his arm, found none, said: “Ah! truly!” and went\noff with a bewildered air.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK TENTH—THE 5TH OF JUNE, 1832\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE SURFACE OF THE QUESTION\n\n\nOf what is revolt composed? Of nothing and of everything. Of an\nelectricity disengaged, little by little, of a flame suddenly darting\nforth, of a wandering force, of a passing breath. This breath\nencounters heads which speak, brains which dream, souls which suffer,\npassions which burn, wretchedness which howls, and bears them away.\n\nWhither?\n\nAt random. Athwart the state, the laws, athwart prosperity and the\ninsolence of others.\n\nIrritated convictions, embittered enthusiasms, agitated indignations,\ninstincts of war which have been repressed, youthful courage which has\nbeen exalted, generous blindness; curiosity, the taste for change, the\nthirst for the unexpected, the sentiment which causes one to take\npleasure in reading the posters for the new play, and love, the\nprompter’s whistle, at the theatre; the vague hatreds, rancors,\ndisappointments, every vanity which thinks that destiny has bankrupted\nit; discomfort, empty dreams, ambitions that are hedged about, whoever\nhopes for a downfall, some outcome, in short, at the very bottom, the\nrabble, that mud which catches fire,—such are the elements of revolt.\nThat which is grandest and that which is basest; the beings who prowl\noutside of all bounds, awaiting an occasion, bohemians, vagrants,\nvagabonds of the crossroads, those who sleep at night in a desert of\nhouses with no other roof than the cold clouds of heaven, those who,\neach day, demand their bread from chance and not from toil, the unknown\nof poverty and nothingness, the bare-armed, the bare-footed, belong to\nrevolt. Whoever cherishes in his soul a secret revolt against any deed\nwhatever on the part of the state, of life or of fate, is ripe for\nriot, and, as soon as it makes its appearance, he begins to quiver, and\nto feel himself borne away with the whirlwind.\n\nRevolt is a sort of waterspout in the social atmosphere which forms\nsuddenly in certain conditions of temperature, and which, as it eddies\nabout, mounts, descends, thunders, tears, razes, crushes, demolishes,\nuproots, bearing with it great natures and small, the strong man and\nthe feeble mind, the tree trunk and the stalk of straw. Woe to him whom\nit bears away as well as to him whom it strikes! It breaks the one\nagainst the other.\n\nIt communicates to those whom it seizes an indescribable and\nextraordinary power. It fills the firstcomer with the force of events;\nit converts everything into projectiles. It makes a cannon-ball of a\nrough stone, and a general of a porter.\n\nIf we are to believe certain oracles of crafty political views, a\nlittle revolt is desirable from the point of view of power. System:\nrevolt strengthens those governments which it does not overthrow. It\nputs the army to the test; it consecrates the bourgeoisie, it draws out\nthe muscles of the police; it demonstrates the force of the social\nframework. It is an exercise in gymnastics; it is almost hygiene. Power\nis in better health after a revolt, as a man is after a good rubbing\ndown.\n\nRevolt, thirty years ago, was regarded from still other points of view.\n\nThere is for everything a theory, which proclaims itself “good sense”;\nPhilintus against Alcestis; mediation offered between the false and the\ntrue; explanation, admonition, rather haughty extenuation which,\nbecause it is mingled with blame and excuse, thinks itself wisdom, and\nis often only pedantry. A whole political school called “the golden\nmean” has been the outcome of this. As between cold water and hot\nwater, it is the lukewarm water party. This school with its false\ndepth, all on the surface, which dissects effects without going back to\nfirst causes, chides from its height of a demi-science, the agitation\nof the public square.\n\nIf we listen to this school, “The riots which complicated the affair of\n1830 deprived that great event of a portion of its purity. The\nRevolution of July had been a fine popular gale, abruptly followed by\nblue sky. They made the cloudy sky reappear. They caused that\nrevolution, at first so remarkable for its unanimity, to degenerate\ninto a quarrel. In the Revolution of July, as in all progress\naccomplished by fits and starts, there had been secret fractures; these\nriots rendered them perceptible. It might have been said: ‘Ah! this is\nbroken.’ After the Revolution of July, one was sensible only of\ndeliverance; after the riots, one was conscious of a catastrophe.\n\n“All revolt closes the shops, depresses the funds, throws the Exchange\ninto consternation, suspends commerce, clogs business, precipitates\nfailures; no more money, private fortunes rendered uneasy, public\ncredit shaken, industry disconcerted, capital withdrawing, work at a\ndiscount, fear everywhere; counter-shocks in every town. Hence gulfs.\nIt has been calculated that the first day of a riot costs France twenty\nmillions, the second day forty, the third sixty, a three days’ uprising\ncosts one hundred and twenty millions, that is to say, if only the\nfinancial result be taken into consideration, it is equivalent to a\ndisaster, a shipwreck or a lost battle, which should annihilate a fleet\nof sixty ships of the line.\n\n“No doubt, historically, uprisings have their beauty; the war of the\npavements is no less grandiose, and no less pathetic, than the war of\nthickets: in the one there is the soul of forests, in the other the\nheart of cities; the one has Jean Chouan, the other has a Jeanne.\nRevolts have illuminated with a red glare all the most original points\nof the Parisian character, generosity, devotion, stormy gayety,\nstudents proving that bravery forms part of intelligence, the National\nGuard invincible, bivouacs of shopkeepers, fortresses of street\nurchins, contempt of death on the part of passers-by. Schools and\nlegions clashed together. After all, between the combatants, there was\nonly a difference of age; the race is the same; it is the same stoical\nmen who died at the age of twenty for their ideas, at forty for their\nfamilies. The army, always a sad thing in civil wars, opposed prudence\nto audacity. Uprisings, while proving popular intrepidity, also\neducated the courage of the bourgeois.\n\n“This is well. But is all this worth the bloodshed? And to the\nbloodshed add the future darkness, progress compromised, uneasiness\namong the best men, honest liberals in despair, foreign absolutism\nhappy in these wounds dealt to revolution by its own hand, the\nvanquished of 1830 triumphing and saying: ‘We told you so!’ Add Paris\nenlarged, possibly, but France most assuredly diminished. Add, for all\nmust needs be told, the massacres which have too often dishonored the\nvictory of order grown ferocious over liberty gone mad. To sum up all,\nuprisings have been disastrous.”\n\n\nThus speaks that approximation to wisdom with which the bourgeoisie,\nthat approximation to the people, so willingly contents itself.\n\nFor our parts, we reject this word _uprisings_ as too large, and\nconsequently as too convenient. We make a distinction between one\npopular movement and another popular movement. We do not inquire\nwhether an uprising costs as much as a battle. Why a battle, in the\nfirst place? Here the question of war comes up. Is war less of a\nscourge than an uprising is of a calamity? And then, are all uprisings\ncalamities? And what if the revolt of July did cost a hundred and\ntwenty millions? The establishment of Philip V. in Spain cost France\ntwo milliards. Even at the same price, we should prefer the 14th of\nJuly. However, we reject these figures, which appear to be reasons and\nwhich are only words. An uprising being given, we examine it by itself.\nIn all that is said by the doctrinarian objection above presented,\nthere is no question of anything but effect, we seek the cause.\n\nWe will be explicit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—THE ROOT OF THE MATTER\n\n\nThere is such a thing as an uprising, and there is such a thing as\ninsurrection; these are two separate phases of wrath; one is in the\nwrong, the other is in the right. In democratic states, the only ones\nwhich are founded on justice, it sometimes happens that the fraction\nusurps; then the whole rises and the necessary claim of its rights may\nproceed as far as resort to arms. In all questions which result from\ncollective sovereignty, the war of the whole against the fraction is\ninsurrection; the attack of the fraction against the whole is revolt;\naccording as the Tuileries contain a king or the Convention, they are\njustly or unjustly attacked. The same cannon, pointed against the\npopulace, is wrong on the 10th of August, and right on the 14th of\nVendémiaire. Alike in appearance, fundamentally different in reality;\nthe Swiss defend the false, Bonaparte defends the true. That which\nuniversal suffrage has effected in its liberty and in its sovereignty\ncannot be undone by the street. It is the same in things pertaining\npurely to civilization; the instinct of the masses, clear-sighted\nto-day, may be troubled to-morrow. The same fury legitimate when\ndirected against Terray and absurd when directed against Turgot. The\ndestruction of machines, the pillage of warehouses, the breaking of\nrails, the demolition of docks, the false routes of multitudes, the\nrefusal by the people of justice to progress, Ramus assassinated by\nstudents, Rousseau driven out of Switzerland and stoned,—that is\nrevolt. Israel against Moses, Athens against Phocian, Rome against\nCicero,—that is an uprising; Paris against the Bastille,—that is\ninsurrection. The soldiers against Alexander, the sailors against\nChristopher Columbus,—this is the same revolt; impious revolt; why?\nBecause Alexander is doing for Asia with the sword that which\nChristopher Columbus is doing for America with the compass; Alexander\nlike Columbus, is finding a world. These gifts of a world to\ncivilization are such augmentations of light, that all resistance in\nthat case is culpable. Sometimes the populace counterfeits fidelity to\nitself. The masses are traitors to the people. Is there, for example,\nanything stranger than that long and bloody protest of dealers in\ncontraband salt, a legitimate chronic revolt, which, at the decisive\nmoment, on the day of salvation, at the very hour of popular victory,\nespouses the throne, turns into _chouannerie_, and, from having been an\ninsurrection against, becomes an uprising for, sombre masterpieces of\nignorance! The contraband salt dealer escapes the royal gibbets, and\nwith a rope’s end round his neck, mounts the white cockade. “Death to\nthe salt duties,” brings forth, “Long live the King!” The assassins of\nSaint-Barthélemy, the cut-throats of September, the manslaughterers of\nAvignon, the assassins of Coligny, the assassins of Madam Lamballe, the\nassassins of Brune, Miquelets, Verdets, Cadenettes, the companions of\nJéhu, the chevaliers of Brassard,—behold an uprising. La Vendée is a\ngrand, catholic uprising. The sound of right in movement is\nrecognizable, it does not always proceed from the trembling of excited\nmasses; there are mad rages, there are cracked bells, all tocsins do\nnot give out the sound of bronze. The brawl of passions and ignorances\nis quite another thing from the shock of progress. Show me in what\ndirection you are going. Rise, if you will, but let it be that you may\ngrow great. There is no insurrection except in a forward direction. Any\nother sort of rising is bad; every violent step towards the rear is a\nrevolt; to retreat is to commit a deed of violence against the human\nrace. Insurrection is a fit of rage on the part of truth; the pavements\nwhich the uprising disturbs give forth the spark of right. These\npavements bequeath to the uprising only their mud. Danton against Louis\nXIV. is insurrection; Hébert against Danton is revolt.\n\nHence it results that if insurrection in given cases may be, as\nLafayette says, the most holy of duties, an uprising may be the most\nfatal of crimes.\n\nThere is also a difference in the intensity of heat; insurrection is\noften a volcano, revolt is often only a fire of straw.\n\nRevolt, as we have said, is sometimes found among those in power.\nPolignac is a rioter; Camille Desmoulins is one of the governing\npowers.\n\nInsurrection is sometimes resurrection.\n\nThe solution of everything by universal suffrage being an absolutely\nmodern fact, and all history anterior to this fact being, for the space\nof four thousand years, filled with violated right, and the suffering\nof peoples, each epoch of history brings with it that protest of which\nit is capable. Under the Cæsars, there was no insurrection, but there\nwas Juvenal.\n\nThe _facit indignatio_ replaces the Gracchi.\n\nUnder the Cæsars, there is the exile to Syene; there is also the man of\nthe _Annales_. We do not speak of the immense exile of Patmos who, on\nhis part also, overwhelms the real world with a protest in the name of\nthe ideal world, who makes of his vision an enormous satire and casts\non Rome-Nineveh, on Rome-Babylon, on Rome-Sodom, the flaming reflection\nof the Apocalypse. John on his rock is the sphinx on its pedestal; we\nmay understand him, he is a Jew, and it is Hebrew; but the man who\nwrites the _Annales_ is of the Latin race, let us rather say he is a\nRoman.\n\nAs the Neros reign in a black way, they should be painted to match. The\nwork of the graving-tool alone would be too pale; there must be poured\ninto the channel a concentrated prose which bites.\n\nDespots count for something in the question of philosophers. A word\nthat is chained is a terrible word. The writer doubles and trebles his\nstyle when silence is imposed on a nation by its master. From this\nsilence there arises a certain mysterious plenitude which filters into\nthought and there congeals into bronze. The compression of history\nproduces conciseness in the historian. The granite solidity of such and\nsuch a celebrated prose is nothing but the accumulation effected by the\ntyrant.\n\nTyranny constrains the writer to conditions of diameter which are\naugmentations of force. The Ciceronian period, which hardly sufficed\nfor Verres, would be blunted on Caligula. The less spread of sail in\nthe phrase, the more intensity in the blow. Tacitus thinks with all his\nmight.\n\nThe honesty of a great heart, condensed in justice and truth,\noverwhelms as with lightning.\n\nBe it remarked, in passing, that Tacitus is not historically superposed\nupon Cæsar. The Tiberii were reserved for him. Cæsar and Tacitus are\ntwo successive phenomena, a meeting between whom seems to be\nmysteriously avoided, by the One who, when He sets the centuries on the\nstage, regulates the entrances and the exits. Cæsar is great, Tacitus\nis great; God spares these two greatnesses by not allowing them to\nclash with one another. The guardian of justice, in striking Cæsar,\nmight strike too hard and be unjust. God does not will it. The great\nwars of Africa and Spain, the pirates of Sicily destroyed, civilization\nintroduced into Gaul, into Britanny, into Germany,—all this glory\ncovers the Rubicon. There is here a sort of delicacy of the divine\njustice, hesitating to let loose upon the illustrious usurper the\nformidable historian, sparing Cæsar Tacitus, and according extenuating\ncircumstances to genius.\n\nCertainly, despotism remains despotism, even under the despot of\ngenius. There is corruption under all illustrious tyrants, but the\nmoral pest is still more hideous under infamous tyrants. In such\nreigns, nothing veils the shame; and those who make examples, Tacitus\nas well as Juvenal, slap this ignominy which cannot reply, in the face,\nmore usefully in the presence of all humanity.\n\nRome smells worse under Vitellius than under Sylla. Under Claudius and\nunder Domitian, there is a deformity of baseness corresponding to the\nrepulsiveness of the tyrant. The villainy of slaves is a direct product\nof the despot; a miasma exhales from these cowering consciences wherein\nthe master is reflected; public powers are unclean; hearts are small;\nconsciences are dull, souls are like vermin; thus it is under\nCaracalla, thus it is under Commodus, thus it is under Heliogabalus,\nwhile, from the Roman Senate, under Cæsar, there comes nothing but the\nodor of the dung which is peculiar to the eyries of the eagles.\n\nHence the advent, apparently tardy, of the Tacituses and the Juvenals;\nit is in the hour for evidence, that the demonstrator makes his\nappearance.\n\nBut Juvenal and Tacitus, like Isaiah in Biblical times, like Dante in\nthe Middle Ages, is man; riot and insurrection are the multitude, which\nis sometimes right and sometimes wrong.\n\nIn the majority of cases, riot proceeds from a material fact;\ninsurrection is always a moral phenomenon. Riot is Masaniello;\ninsurrection, Spartacus. Insurrection borders on mind, riot on the\nstomach; Gaster grows irritated; but Gaster, assuredly, is not always\nin the wrong. In questions of famine, riot, Buzançais, for example,\nholds a true, pathetic, and just point of departure. Nevertheless, it\nremains a riot. Why? It is because, right at bottom, it was wrong in\nform. Shy although in the right, violent although strong, it struck at\nrandom; it walked like a blind elephant; it left behind it the corpses\nof old men, of women, and of children; it wished the blood of\ninoffensive and innocent persons without knowing why. The nourishment\nof the people is a good object; to massacre them is a bad means.\n\nAll armed protests, even the most legitimate, even that of the 10th of\nAugust, even that of July 14th, begin with the same troubles. Before\nthe right gets set free, there is foam and tumult. In the beginning,\nthe insurrection is a riot, just as a river is a torrent. Ordinarily it\nends in that ocean: revolution. Sometimes, however, coming from those\nlofty mountains which dominate the moral horizon, justice, wisdom,\nreason, right, formed of the pure snow of the ideal, after a long fall\nfrom rock to rock, after having reflected the sky in its transparency\nand increased by a hundred affluents in the majestic mien of triumph,\ninsurrection is suddenly lost in some quagmire, as the Rhine is in a\nswamp.\n\nAll this is of the past, the future is another thing. Universal\nsuffrage has this admirable property, that it dissolves riot in its\ninception, and, by giving the vote to insurrection, it deprives it of\nits arms. The disappearance of wars, of street wars as well as of wars\non the frontiers, such is the inevitable progression. Whatever To-day\nmay be, To-morrow will be peace.\n\nHowever, insurrection, riot, and points of difference between the\nformer and the latter,—the bourgeois, properly speaking, knows nothing\nof such shades. In his mind, all is sedition, rebellion pure and\nsimple, the revolt of the dog against his master, an attempt to bite\nwhom must be punished by the chain and the kennel, barking, snapping,\nuntil such day as the head of the dog, suddenly enlarged, is outlined\nvaguely in the gloom face to face with the lion.\n\nThen the bourgeois shouts: “Long live the people!”\n\n\nThis explanation given, what does the movement of June, 1832, signify,\nso far as history is concerned? Is it a revolt? Is it an insurrection?\n\nIt may happen to us, in placing this formidable event on the stage, to\nsay revolt now and then, but merely to distinguish superficial facts,\nand always preserving the distinction between revolt, the form, and\ninsurrection, the foundation.\n\nThis movement of 1832 had, in its rapid outbreak and in its melancholy\nextinction, so much grandeur, that even those who see in it only an\nuprising, never refer to it otherwise than with respect. For them, it\nis like a relic of 1830. Excited imaginations, say they, are not to be\ncalmed in a day. A revolution cannot be cut off short. It must needs\nundergo some undulations before it returns to a state of rest, like a\nmountain sinking into the plain. There are no Alps without their Jura,\nnor Pyrenees without the Asturias.\n\nThis pathetic crisis of contemporary history which the memory of\nParisians calls “the epoch of the riots,” is certainly a characteristic\nhour amid the stormy hours of this century. A last word, before we\nenter on the recital.\n\nThe facts which we are about to relate belong to that dramatic and\nliving reality, which the historian sometimes neglects for lack of time\nand space. There, nevertheless, we insist upon it, is life,\npalpitation, human tremor. Petty details, as we think we have already\nsaid, are, so to speak, the foliage of great events, and are lost in\nthe distance of history. The epoch, surnamed “of the riots,” abounds in\ndetails of this nature. Judicial inquiries have not revealed, and\nperhaps have not sounded the depths, for another reason than history.\nWe shall therefore bring to light, among the known and published\npeculiarities, things which have not heretofore been known, about facts\nover which have passed the forgetfulness of some, and the death of\nothers. The majority of the actors in these gigantic scenes have\ndisappeared; beginning with the very next day they held their peace;\nbut of what we shall relate, we shall be able to say: “We have seen\nthis.” We alter a few names, for history relates and does not inform\nagainst, but the deed which we shall paint will be genuine. In\naccordance with the conditions of the book which we are now writing, we\nshall show only one side and one episode, and certainly, the least\nknown at that, of the two days, the 5th and the 6th of June, 1832, but\nwe shall do it in such wise that the reader may catch a glimpse,\nbeneath the gloomy veil which we are about to lift, of the real form of\nthis frightful public adventure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—A BURIAL; AN OCCASION TO BE BORN AGAIN\n\n\nIn the spring of 1832, although the cholera had been chilling all minds\nfor the last three months and had cast over their agitation an\nindescribable and gloomy pacification, Paris had already long been ripe\nfor commotion. As we have said, the great city resembles a piece of\nartillery; when it is loaded, it suffices for a spark to fall, and the\nshot is discharged. In June, 1832, the spark was the death of General\nLamarque.\n\nLamarque was a man of renown and of action. He had had in succession,\nunder the Empire and under the Restoration, the sorts of bravery\nrequisite for the two epochs, the bravery of the battle-field and the\nbravery of the tribune. He was as eloquent as he had been valiant; a\nsword was discernible in his speech. Like Foy, his predecessor, after\nupholding the command, he upheld liberty; he sat between the left and\nthe extreme left, beloved of the people because he accepted the chances\nof the future, beloved of the populace because he had served the\nEmperor well; he was, in company with Comtes Gérard and Drouet, one of\nNapoleon’s marshals _in petto_. The treaties of 1815 removed him as a\npersonal offence. He hated Wellington with a downright hatred which\npleased the multitude; and, for seventeen years, he majestically\npreserved the sadness of Waterloo, paying hardly any attention to\nintervening events. In his death agony, at his last hour, he clasped to\nhis breast a sword which had been presented to him by the officers of\nthe Hundred Days. Napoleon had died uttering the word _army_, Lamarque\nuttering the word _country_.\n\nHis death, which was expected, was dreaded by the people as a loss, and\nby the government as an occasion. This death was an affliction. Like\neverything that is bitter, affliction may turn to revolt. This is what\ntook place.\n\nOn the preceding evening, and on the morning of the 5th of June, the\nday appointed for Lamarque’s burial, the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which\nthe procession was to touch at, assumed a formidable aspect. This\ntumultuous network of streets was filled with rumors. They armed\nthemselves as best they might. Joiners carried off door-weights of\ntheir establishment “to break down doors.” One of them had made himself\na dagger of a stocking-weaver’s hook by breaking off the hook and\nsharpening the stump. Another, who was in a fever “to attack,” slept\nwholly dressed for three days. A carpenter named Lombier met a comrade,\nwho asked him: “Whither are you going?” “Eh! well, I have no weapons.”\n“What then?” “I’m going to my timber-yard to get my compasses.” “What\nfor?” “I don’t know,” said Lombier. A certain Jacqueline, an\nexpeditious man, accosted some passing artisans: “Come here, you!” He\ntreated them to ten sous’ worth of wine and said: “Have you work?”\n“No.” “Go to Filspierre, between the Barrière Charonne and the Barrière\nMontreuil, and you will find work.” At Filspierre’s they found\ncartridges and arms. Certain well-known leaders were going the rounds,\nthat is to say, running from one house to another, to collect their\nmen. At Barthélemy’s, near the Barrière du Trône, at Capel’s, near the\nPetit-Chapeau, the drinkers accosted each other with a grave air. They\nwere heard to say: “Have you your pistol?” “Under my blouse.” “And\nyou?” “Under my shirt.” In the Rue Traversière, in front of the Bland\nworkshop, and in the yard of the Maison-Brulée, in front of tool-maker\nBernier’s, groups whispered together. Among them was observed a certain\nMavot, who never remained more than a week in one shop, as the masters\nalways discharged him “because they were obliged to dispute with him\nevery day.” Mavot was killed on the following day at the barricade of\nthe Rue Ménilmontant. Pretot, who was destined to perish also in the\nstruggle, seconded Mavot, and to the question: “What is your object?”\nhe replied: _“Insurrection.”_ Workmen assembled at the corner of the\nRue de Bercy, waited for a certain Lemarin, the revolutionary agent for\nthe Faubourg Saint-Marceau. Watchwords were exchanged almost publicly.\n\nOn the 5th of June, accordingly, a day of mingled rain and sun, General\nLamarque’s funeral procession traversed Paris with official military\npomp, somewhat augmented through precaution. Two battalions, with\ndraped drums and reversed arms, ten thousand National Guards, with\ntheir swords at their sides, escorted the coffin. The hearse was drawn\nby young men. The officers of the Invalides came immediately behind it,\nbearing laurel branches. Then came an innumerable, strange, agitated\nmultitude, the sectionaries of the Friends of the People, the Law\nSchool, the Medical School, refugees of all nationalities, and Spanish,\nItalian, German, and Polish flags, tricolored horizontal banners, every\npossible sort of banner, children waving green boughs, stone-cutters\nand carpenters who were on strike at the moment, printers who were\nrecognizable by their paper caps, marching two by two, three by three,\nuttering cries, nearly all of them brandishing sticks, some brandishing\nsabres, without order and yet with a single soul, now a tumultuous\nrout, again a column. Squads chose themselves leaders; a man armed with\na pair of pistols in full view, seemed to pass the host in review, and\nthe files separated before him. On the side alleys of the boulevards,\nin the branches of the trees, on balconies, in windows, on the roofs,\nswarmed the heads of men, women, and children; all eyes were filled\nwith anxiety. An armed throng was passing, and a terrified throng\nlooked on.\n\nThe Government, on its side, was taking observations. It observed with\nits hand on its sword. Four squadrons of carabineers could be seen in\nthe Place Louis XV. in their saddles, with their trumpets at their\nhead, cartridge-boxes filled and muskets loaded, all in readiness to\nmarch; in the Latin country and at the Jardin des Plantes, the\nMunicipal Guard echelonned from street to street; at the\nHalle-aux-Vins, a squadron of dragoons; at the Grève half of the 12th\nLight Infantry, the other half being at the Bastille; the 6th Dragoons\nat the Célestins; and the courtyard of the Louvre full of artillery.\nThe remainder of the troops were confined to their barracks, without\nreckoning the regiments of the environs of Paris. Power being uneasy,\nheld suspended over the menacing multitude twenty-four thousand\nsoldiers in the city and thirty thousand in the banlieue.\n\nDivers reports were in circulation in the cortège. Legitimist tricks\nwere hinted at; they spoke of the Duc de Reichstadt, whom God had\nmarked out for death at that very moment when the populace were\ndesignating him for the Empire. One personage, whose name has remained\nunknown, announced that at a given hour two overseers who had been won\nover, would throw open the doors of a factory of arms to the people.\nThat which predominated on the uncovered brows of the majority of those\npresent was enthusiasm mingled with dejection. Here and there, also, in\nthat multitude given over to such violent but noble emotions, there\nwere visible genuine visages of criminals and ignoble mouths which\nsaid: “Let us plunder!” There are certain agitations which stir up the\nbottoms of marshes and make clouds of mud rise through the water. A\nphenomenon to which “well drilled” policemen are no strangers.\n\nThe procession proceeded, with feverish slowness, from the house of the\ndeceased, by way of the boulevards as far as the Bastille. It rained\nfrom time to time; the rain mattered nothing to that throng. Many\nincidents, the coffin borne round the Vendome column, stones thrown at\nthe Duc de Fitz-James, who was seen on a balcony with his hat on his\nhead, the Gallic cock torn from a popular flag and dragged in the mire,\na policeman wounded with a blow from a sword at the Porte Saint-Martin,\nan officer of the 12th Light Infantry saying aloud: “I am a\nRepublican,” the Polytechnic School coming up unexpectedly against\norders to remain at home, the shouts of: “Long live the Polytechnique!\nLong live the Republic!” marked the passage of the funeral train. At\nthe Bastille, long files of curious and formidable people who descended\nfrom the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, effected a junction with the\nprocession, and a certain terrible seething began to agitate the\nthrong.\n\nOne man was heard to say to another: “Do you see that fellow with a red\nbeard, he’s the one who will give the word when we are to fire.” It\nappears that this red beard was present, at another riot, the Quénisset\naffair, entrusted with this same function.\n\nThe hearse passed the Bastille, traversed the small bridge, and reached\nthe esplanade of the bridge of Austerlitz. There it halted. The crowd,\nsurveyed at that moment with a bird’s-eye view, would have presented\nthe aspect of a comet whose head was on the esplanade and whose tail\nspread out over the Quai Bourdon, covered the Bastille, and was\nprolonged on the boulevard as far as the Porte Saint-Martin. A circle\nwas traced around the hearse. The vast rout held their peace. Lafayette\nspoke and bade Lamarque farewell. This was a touching and august\ninstant, all heads uncovered, all hearts beat high.\n\nAll at once, a man on horseback, clad in black, made his appearance in\nthe middle of the group with a red flag, others say, with a pike\nsurmounted with a red liberty-cap. Lafayette turned aside his head.\nExelmans quitted the procession.\n\nThis red flag raised a storm, and disappeared in the midst of it. From\nthe Boulevard Bourdon to the bridge of Austerlitz one of those clamors\nwhich resemble billows stirred the multitude. Two prodigious shouts\nwent up: “Lamarque to the Pantheon!—Lafayette to the Town-hall!” Some\nyoung men, amid the declamations of the throng, harnessed themselves\nand began to drag Lamarque in the hearse across the bridge of\nAusterlitz and Lafayette in a hackney-coach along the Quai Morland.\n\nIn the crowd which surrounded and cheered Lafayette, it was noticed\nthat a German showed himself named Ludwig Snyder, who died a\ncentenarian afterwards, who had also been in the war of 1776, and who\nhad fought at Trenton under Washington, and at Brandywine under\nLafayette.\n\nIn the meantime, the municipal cavalry on the left bank had been set in\nmotion, and came to bar the bridge, on the right bank the dragoons\nemerged from the Célestins and deployed along the Quai Morland. The men\nwho were dragging Lafayette suddenly caught sight of them at the corner\nof the quay and shouted: “The dragoons!” The dragoons advanced at a\nwalk, in silence, with their pistols in their holsters, their swords in\ntheir scabbards, their guns slung in their leather sockets, with an air\nof gloomy expectation.\n\nThey halted two hundred paces from the little bridge. The carriage in\nwhich sat Lafayette advanced to them, their ranks opened and allowed it\nto pass, and then closed behind it. At that moment the dragoons and the\ncrowd touched. The women fled in terror. What took place during that\nfatal minute? No one can say. It is the dark moment when two clouds\ncome together. Some declare that a blast of trumpets sounding the\ncharge was heard in the direction of the Arsenal, others that a blow\nfrom a dagger was given by a child to a dragoon. The fact is, that\nthree shots were suddenly discharged: the first killed Cholet, chief of\nthe squadron, the second killed an old deaf woman who was in the act of\nclosing her window, the third singed the shoulder of an officer; a\nwoman screamed: “They are beginning too soon!” and all at once, a\nsquadron of dragoons which had remained in the barracks up to this\ntime, was seen to debouch at a gallop with bared swords, through the\nRue Bassompierre and the Boulevard Bourdon, sweeping all before them.\n\nThen all is said, the tempest is loosed, stones rain down, a fusillade\nbreaks forth, many precipitate themselves to the bottom of the bank,\nand pass the small arm of the Seine, now filled in, the timber-yards of\nthe Isle Louviers, that vast citadel ready to hand, bristle with\ncombatants, stakes are torn up, pistol-shots fired, a barricade begun,\nthe young men who are thrust back pass the Austerlitz bridge with the\nhearse at a run, and the municipal guard, the carabineers rush up, the\ndragoons ply their swords, the crowd disperses in all directions, a\nrumor of war flies to all four quarters of Paris, men shout: “To arms!”\nthey run, tumble down, flee, resist. Wrath spreads abroad the riot as\nwind spreads a fire.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—THE EBULLITIONS OF FORMER DAYS\n\n\nNothing is more extraordinary than the first breaking out of a riot.\nEverything bursts forth everywhere at once. Was it foreseen? Yes. Was\nit prepared? No. Whence comes it? From the pavements. Whence falls it?\nFrom the clouds. Here insurrection assumes the character of a plot;\nthere of an improvisation. The first comer seizes a current of the\nthrong and leads it whither he wills. A beginning full of terror, in\nwhich is mingled a sort of formidable gayety. First come clamors, the\nshops are closed, the displays of the merchants disappear; then come\nisolated shots; people flee; blows from gun-stocks beat against\nportes-cochères, servants can be heard laughing in the courtyards of\nhouses and saying: “There’s going to be a row!”\n\n\nA quarter of an hour had not elapsed when this is what was taking place\nat twenty different spots in Paris at once.\n\nIn the Rue Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie, twenty young men, bearded\nand with long hair, entered a dram-shop and emerged a moment later,\ncarrying a horizontal tricolored flag covered with crape, and having at\ntheir head three men armed, one with a sword, one with a gun, and the\nthird with a pike.\n\nIn the Rue des Nonaindières, a very well-dressed bourgeois, who had a\nprominent belly, a sonorous voice, a bald head, a lofty brow, a black\nbeard, and one of these stiff moustaches which will not lie flat,\noffered cartridges publicly to passers-by.\n\nIn the Rue Saint-Pierre-Montmartre, men with bare arms carried about a\nblack flag, on which could be read in white letters this inscription:\n“Republic or Death!” In the Rue des Jeûneurs, Rue du Cadran, Rue\nMontorgueil, Rue Mandar, groups appeared waving flags on which could be\ndistinguished in gold letters, the word _section_ with a number. One of\nthese flags was red and blue with an almost imperceptible stripe of\nwhite between.\n\nThey pillaged a factory of small-arms on the Boulevard Saint-Martin,\nand three armorers’ shops, the first in the Rue Beaubourg, the second\nin the Rue Michel-le-Comte, the other in the Rue du Temple. In a few\nminutes, the thousand hands of the crowd had seized and carried off two\nhundred and thirty guns, nearly all double-barrelled, sixty-four\nswords, and eighty-three pistols. In order to provide more arms, one\nman took the gun, the other the bayonet.\n\nOpposite the Quai de la Grève, young men armed with muskets installed\nthemselves in the houses of some women for the purpose of firing. One\nof them had a flint-lock. They rang, entered, and set about making\ncartridges. One of these women relates: “I did not know what cartridges\nwere; it was my husband who told me.”\n\n\nOne cluster broke into a curiosity shop in the Rue des\nVieilles-Haudriettes, and seized yataghans and Turkish arms.\n\nThe body of a mason who had been killed by a gun-shot lay in the Rue de\nla Perle.\n\nAnd then on the right bank, the left bank, on the quays, on the\nboulevards, in the Latin country, in the quarter of the Halles, panting\nmen, artisans, students, members of sections read proclamations and\nshouted: “To arms!” broke street lanterns, unharnessed carriages,\nunpaved the streets, broke in the doors of houses, uprooted trees,\nrummaged cellars, rolled out hogsheads, heaped up paving-stones, rough\nslabs, furniture and planks, and made barricades.\n\nThey forced the bourgeois to assist them in this. They entered the\ndwellings of women, they forced them to hand over the swords and guns\nof their absent husbands, and they wrote on the door, with whiting:\n“The arms have been delivered”; some signed “their names” to receipts\nfor the guns and swords and said: “Send for them to-morrow at the\nMayor’s office.” They disarmed isolated sentinels and National\nGuardsmen in the streets on their way to the Townhall. They tore the\nepaulets from officers. In the Rue du Cimitière-Saint-Nicholas, an\nofficer of the National Guard, on being pursued by a crowd armed with\nclubs and foils, took refuge with difficulty in a house, whence he was\nonly able to emerge at nightfall and in disguise.\n\nIn the Quartier Saint-Jacques, the students swarmed out of their hotels\nand ascended the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe to the Café du Progrèss, or\ndescended to the Café des Sept-Billards, in the Rue des Mathurins.\nThere, in front of the door, young men mounted on the stone\ncorner-posts, distributed arms. They plundered the timber-yard in the\nRue Transnonain in order to obtain material for barricades. On a single\npoint the inhabitants resisted, at the corner of the Rue Sainte-Avoye\nand the Rue Simon-Le-Franc, where they destroyed the barricade with\ntheir own hands. At a single point the insurgents yielded; they\nabandoned a barricade begun in the Rue de Temple after having fired on\na detachment of the National Guard, and fled through the Rue de la\nCorderie. The detachment picked up in the barricade a red flag, a\npackage of cartridges, and three hundred pistol-balls. The National\nGuardsmen tore up the flag, and carried off its tattered remains on the\npoints of their bayonets.\n\nAll that we are here relating slowly and successively took place\nsimultaneously at all points of the city in the midst of a vast tumult,\nlike a mass of tongues of lightning in one clap of thunder. In less\nthan an hour, twenty-seven barricades sprang out of the earth in the\nquarter of the Halles alone. In the centre was that famous house No.\n50, which was the fortress of Jeanne and her six hundred companions,\nand which, flanked on the one hand by a barricade at Saint-Merry, and\non the other by a barricade of the Rue Maubuée, commanded three\nstreets, the Rue des Arcis, the Rue Saint-Martin, and the Rue\nAubry-le-Boucher, which it faced. The barricades at right angles fell\nback, the one of the Rue Montorgueil on the Grande-Truanderie, the\nother of the Rue Geoffroy-Langevin on the Rue Sainte-Avoye. Without\nreckoning innumerable barricades in twenty other quarters of Paris, in\nthe Marais, at Mont-Sainte-Geneviève; one in the Rue Ménilmontant,\nwhere was visible a porte-cochère torn from its hinges; another near\nthe little bridge of the Hôtel-Dieu made with an “écossais,” which had\nbeen unharnessed and overthrown, three hundred paces from the\nPrefecture of Police.\n\nAt the barricade of the Rue des Ménétriers, a well-dressed man\ndistributed money to the workmen. At the barricade of the Rue Grenetat,\na horseman made his appearance and handed to the one who seemed to be\nthe commander of the barricade what had the appearance of a roll of\nsilver. “Here,” said he, “this is to pay expenses, wine, et cætera.” A\nlight-haired young man, without a cravat, went from barricade to\nbarricade, carrying pass-words. Another, with a naked sword, a blue\npolice cap on his head, placed sentinels. In the interior, beyond the\nbarricades, the wine-shops and porters’ lodges were converted into\nguard-houses. Otherwise the riot was conducted after the most\nscientific military tactics. The narrow, uneven, sinuous streets, full\nof angles and turns, were admirably chosen; the neighborhood of the\nHalles, in particular, a network of streets more intricate than a\nforest. The Society of the Friends of the People had, it was said,\nundertaken to direct the insurrection in the Quartier Sainte-Avoye. A\nman killed in the Rue du Ponceau who was searched had on his person a\nplan of Paris.\n\nThat which had really undertaken the direction of the uprising was a\nsort of strange impetuosity which was in the air. The insurrection had\nabruptly built barricades with one hand, and with the other seized\nnearly all the posts of the garrison. In less than three hours, like a\ntrain of powder catching fire, the insurgents had invaded and occupied,\non the right bank, the Arsenal, the Mayoralty of the Place Royale, the\nwhole of the Marais, the Popincourt arms manufactory, la Galiote, the\nChâteau-d’Eau, and all the streets near the Halles; on the left bank,\nthe barracks of the Veterans, Sainte-Pélagie, the Place Maubert, the\npowder magazine of the Deux-Moulins, and all the barriers. At five\no’clock in the evening, they were masters of the Bastille, of the\nLingerie, of the Blancs-Manteaux; their scouts had reached the Place\ndes Victoires, and menaced the Bank, the Petits-Pères barracks, and the\nPost-Office. A third of Paris was in the hands of the rioters.\n\nThe conflict had been begun on a gigantic scale at all points; and, as\na result of the disarming domiciliary visits, and armorers’ shops\nhastily invaded, was, that the combat which had begun with the throwing\nof stones was continued with gun-shots.\n\nAbout six o’clock in the evening, the Passage du Saumon became the\nfield of battle. The uprising was at one end, the troops were at the\nother. They fired from one gate to the other. An observer, a dreamer,\nthe author of this book, who had gone to get a near view of this\nvolcano, found himself in the passage between the two fires. All that\nhe had to protect him from the bullets was the swell of the two\nhalf-columns which separate the shops; he remained in this delicate\nsituation for nearly half an hour.\n\nMeanwhile the call to arms was beaten, the National Guard armed in\nhaste, the legions emerged from the Mayoralities, the regiments from\ntheir barracks. Opposite the passage de l’Ancre a drummer received a\nblow from a dagger. Another, in the Rue du Cygne, was assailed by\nthirty young men who broke his instrument, and took away his sword.\nAnother was killed in the Rue Grenier-Saint-Lazare. In the Rue\nMichel-le-Comte, three officers fell dead one after the other. Many of\nthe Municipal Guards, on being wounded, in the Rue des Lombards,\nretreated.\n\nIn front of the Cour-Batave, a detachment of National Guards found a\nred flag bearing the following inscription: _Republican revolution, No.\n127_. Was this a revolution, in fact?\n\nThe insurrection had made of the centre of Paris a sort of\ninextricable, tortuous, colossal citadel.\n\nThere was the hearth; there, evidently, was the question. All the rest\nwas nothing but skirmishes. The proof that all would be decided there\nlay in the fact that there was no fighting going on there as yet.\n\nIn some regiments, the soldiers were uncertain, which added to the\nfearful uncertainty of the crisis. They recalled the popular ovation\nwhich had greeted the neutrality of the 53d of the Line in July, 1830.\nTwo intrepid men, tried in great wars, the Marshal Lobau and General\nBugeaud, were in command, Bugeaud under Lobau. Enormous patrols,\ncomposed of battalions of the Line, enclosed in entire companies of the\nNational Guard, and preceded by a commissary of police wearing his\nscarf of office, went to reconnoitre the streets in rebellion. The\ninsurgents, on their side, placed videttes at the corners of all open\nspaces, and audaciously sent their patrols outside the barricades. Each\nside was watching the other. The Government, with an army in its hand,\nhesitated; the night was almost upon them, and the Saint-Merry tocsin\nbegan to make itself heard. The Minister of War at that time, Marshal\nSoult, who had seen Austerlitz, regarded this with a gloomy air.\n\nThese old sailors, accustomed to correct manœuvres and having as\nresource and guide only tactics, that compass of battles, are utterly\ndisconcerted in the presence of that immense foam which is called\npublic wrath.\n\nThe National Guards of the suburbs rushed up in haste and disorder. A\nbattalion of the 12th Light came at a run from Saint-Denis, the 14th of\nthe Line arrived from Courbevoie, the batteries of the Military School\nhad taken up their position on the Carrousel; cannons were descending\nfrom Vincennes.\n\nSolitude was formed around the Tuileries. Louis Philippe was perfectly\nserene.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—ORIGINALITY OF PARIS\n\n\nDuring the last two years, as we have said, Paris had witnessed more\nthan one insurrection. Nothing is, generally, more singularly calm than\nthe physiognomy of Paris during an uprising beyond the bounds of the\nrebellious quarters. Paris very speedily accustoms herself to\nanything,—it is only a riot,—and Paris has so many affairs on hand,\nthat she does not put herself out for so small a matter. These colossal\ncities alone can offer such spectacles. These immense enclosures alone\ncan contain at the same time civil war and an odd and indescribable\ntranquillity. Ordinarily, when an insurrection commences, when the\nshop-keeper hears the drum, the call to arms, the general alarm, he\ncontents himself with the remark:—\n\n“There appears to be a squabble in the Rue Saint-Martin.”\n\n\nOr:—\n\n“In the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.”\n\n\nOften he adds carelessly:—\n\n“Or somewhere in that direction.”\n\n\nLater on, when the heart-rending and mournful hubbub of musketry and\nfiring by platoons becomes audible, the shopkeeper says:—\n\n“It’s getting hot! Hullo, it’s getting hot!”\n\n\nA moment later, the riot approaches and gains in force, he shuts up his\nshop precipitately, hastily dons his uniform, that is to say, he places\nhis merchandise in safety and risks his own person.\n\nMen fire in a square, in a passage, in a blind alley; they take and\nre-take the barricade; blood flows, the grape-shot riddles the fronts\nof the houses, the balls kill people in their beds, corpses encumber\nthe streets. A few streets away, the shock of billiard-balls can be\nheard in the cafés.\n\nThe theatres open their doors and present vaudevilles; the curious\nlaugh and chat a couple of paces distant from these streets filled with\nwar. Hackney-carriages go their way; passers-by are going to a dinner\nsomewhere in town. Sometimes in the very quarter where the fighting is\ngoing on.\n\nIn 1831, a fusillade was stopped to allow a wedding party to pass.\n\nAt the time of the insurrection of 1839, in the Rue Saint-Martin a\nlittle, infirm old man, pushing a hand-cart surmounted by a tricolored\nrag, in which he had carafes filled with some sort of liquid, went and\ncame from barricade to troops and from troops to the barricade,\noffering his glasses of cocoa impartially,—now to the Government, now\nto anarchy.\n\nNothing can be stranger; and this is the peculiar character of\nuprisings in Paris, which cannot be found in any other capital. To this\nend, two things are requisite, the size of Paris and its gayety. The\ncity of Voltaire and Napoleon is necessary.\n\nOn this occasion, however, in the resort to arms of June 5th, 1832, the\ngreat city felt something which was, perhaps, stronger than itself. It\nwas afraid.\n\nClosed doors, windows, and shutters were to be seen everywhere, in the\nmost distant and most “disinterested” quarters. The courageous took to\narms, the poltroons hid. The busy and heedless passer-by disappeared.\nMany streets were empty at four o’clock in the morning.\n\nAlarming details were hawked about, fatal news was disseminated,—that\n_they_ were masters of the Bank;—that there were six hundred of them in\nthe Cloister of Saint-Merry alone, entrenched and embattled in the\nchurch; that the line was not to be depended on; that Armand Carrel had\nbeen to see Marshal Clausel and that the Marshal had said: “Get a\nregiment first”; that Lafayette was ill, but that he had said to them,\nnevertheless: “I am with you. I will follow you wherever there is room\nfor a chair”; that one must be on one’s guard; that at night there\nwould be people pillaging isolated dwellings in the deserted corners of\nParis (there the imagination of the police, that Anne Radcliffe mixed\nup with the Government was recognizable); that a battery had been\nestablished in the Rue Aubry le Boucher; that Lobau and Bugeaud were\nputting their heads together, and that, at midnight, or at daybreak at\nlatest, four columns would march simultaneously on the centre of the\nuprising, the first coming from the Bastille, the second from the Porte\nSaint-Martin, the third from the Grève, the fourth from the Halles;\nthat perhaps, also, the troops would evacuate Paris and withdraw to the\nChamp-de-Mars; that no one knew what would happen, but that this time,\nit certainly was serious.\n\nPeople busied themselves over Marshal Soult’s hesitations. Why did not\nhe attack at once? It is certain that he was profoundly absorbed. The\nold lion seemed to scent an unknown monster in that gloom.\n\nEvening came, the theatres did not open; the patrols circulated with an\nair of irritation; passers-by were searched; suspicious persons were\narrested. By nine o’clock, more than eight hundred persons had been\narrested, the Prefecture of Police was encumbered with them, so was the\nConciergerie, so was La Force.\n\nAt the Conciergerie in particular, the long vault which is called the\nRue de Paris was littered with trusses of straw upon which lay a heap\nof prisoners, whom the man of Lyons, Lagrange, harangued valiantly. All\nthat straw rustled by all these men, produced the sound of a heavy\nshower. Elsewhere prisoners slept in the open air in the meadows, piled\non top of each other.\n\nAnxiety reigned everywhere, and a certain tremor which was not habitual\nwith Paris.\n\nPeople barricaded themselves in their houses; wives and mothers were\nuneasy; nothing was to be heard but this: “Ah! my God! He has not come\nhome!” There was hardly even the distant rumble of a vehicle to be\nheard.\n\nPeople listened on their thresholds, to the rumors, the shouts, the\ntumult, the dull and indistinct sounds, to the things that were said:\n“It is cavalry,” or: “Those are the caissons galloping,” to the\ntrumpets, the drums, the firing, and, above all, to that lamentable\nalarm peal from Saint-Merry.\n\nThey waited for the first cannon-shot. Men sprang up at the corners of\nthe streets and disappeared, shouting: “Go home!” And people made haste\nto bolt their doors. They said: “How will all this end?” From moment to\nmoment, in proportion as the darkness descended, Paris seemed to take\non a more mournful hue from the formidable flaming of the revolt.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVENTH—THE ATOM FRATERNIZES WITH THE HURRICANE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—SOME EXPLANATIONS WITH REGARD TO THE ORIGIN OF GAVROCHE’S\nPOETRY. THE INFLUENCE OF AN ACADEMICIAN ON THIS POETRY\n\n\nAt the instant when the insurrection, arising from the shock of the\npopulace and the military in front of the Arsenal, started a movement\nin advance and towards the rear in the multitude which was following\nthe hearse and which, through the whole length of the boulevards,\nweighed, so to speak, on the head of the procession, there arose a\nfrightful ebb. The rout was shaken, their ranks were broken, all ran,\nfled, made their escape, some with shouts of attack, others with the\npallor of flight. The great river which covered the boulevards divided\nin a twinkling, overflowed to right and left, and spread in torrents\nover two hundred streets at once with the roar of a sewer that has\nbroken loose.\n\nAt that moment, a ragged child who was coming down through the Rue\nMénilmontant, holding in his hand a branch of blossoming laburnum which\nhe had just plucked on the heights of Belleville, caught sight of an\nold holster-pistol in the show-window of a bric-à-brac merchant’s shop.\n\n“Mother What’s-your-name, I’m going to borrow your machine.”\n\n\nAnd off he ran with the pistol.\n\nTwo minutes later, a flood of frightened bourgeois who were fleeing\nthrough the Rue Amelot and the Rue Basse, encountered the lad\nbrandishing his pistol and singing:—\n\nLa nuit on ne voit rien,\nLe jour on voit très bien,\nD’un écrit apocryphe\nLe bourgeois s‘ébouriffe,\nPratiquez la vertu,\nTutu, chapeau pointu!44\n\n\nIt was little Gavroche on his way to the wars.\n\nOn the boulevard he noticed that the pistol had no trigger.\n\nWho was the author of that couplet which served to punctuate his march,\nand of all the other songs which he was fond of singing on occasion? We\nknow not. Who does know? Himself, perhaps. However, Gavroche was well\nup in all the popular tunes in circulation, and he mingled with them\nhis own chirpings. An observing urchin and a rogue, he made a potpourri\nof the voices of nature and the voices of Paris. He combined the\nrepertory of the birds with the repertory of the workshops. He was\nacquainted with thieves, a tribe contiguous to his own. He had, it\nappears, been for three months apprenticed to a printer. He had one day\nexecuted a commission for M. Baour-Lormian, one of the Forty. Gavroche\nwas a gamin of letters.\n\nMoreover, Gavroche had no suspicion of the fact that when he had\noffered the hospitality of his elephant to two brats on that\nvillainously rainy night, it was to his own brothers that he had played\nthe part of Providence. His brothers in the evening, his father in the\nmorning; that is what his night had been like. On quitting the Rue des\nBallets at daybreak, he had returned in haste to the elephant, had\nartistically extracted from it the two brats, had shared with them some\nsort of breakfast which he had invented, and had then gone away,\nconfiding them to that good mother, the street, who had brought him up,\nalmost entirely. On leaving them, he had appointed to meet them at the\nsame spot in the evening, and had left them this discourse by way of a\nfarewell: “I break a cane, otherwise expressed, I cut my stick, or, as\nthey say at the court, I file off. If you don’t find papa and mamma,\nyoung ‘uns, come back here this evening. I’ll scramble you up some\nsupper, and I’ll give you a shakedown.” The two children, picked up by\nsome policeman and placed in the refuge, or stolen by some mountebank,\nor having simply strayed off in that immense Chinese puzzle of a Paris,\ndid not return. The lowest depths of the actual social world are full\nof these lost traces. Gavroche did not see them again. Ten or twelve\nweeks had elapsed since that night. More than once he had scratched the\nback of his head and said: “Where the devil are my two children?”\n\n\nIn the meantime, he had arrived, pistol in hand, in the Rue du\nPont-aux-Choux. He noticed that there was but one shop open in that\nstreet, and, a matter worthy of reflection, that was a pastry-cook’s\nshop. This presented a providential occasion to eat another\napple-turnover before entering the unknown. Gavroche halted, fumbled in\nhis fob, turned his pocket inside out, found nothing, not even a sou,\nand began to shout: “Help!”\n\n\nIt is hard to miss the last cake.\n\nNevertheless, Gavroche pursued his way.\n\nTwo minutes later he was in the Rue Saint-Louis. While traversing the\nRue du Parc-Royal, he felt called upon to make good the loss of the\napple-turnover which had been impossible, and he indulged himself in\nthe immense delight of tearing down the theatre posters in broad\ndaylight.\n\nA little further on, on catching sight of a group of\ncomfortable-looking persons, who seemed to be landed proprietors, he\nshrugged his shoulders and spit out at random before him this mouthful\nof philosophical bile as they passed:\n\n“How fat those moneyed men are! They’re drunk! They just wallow in good\ndinners. Ask ‘em what they do with their money. They don’t know. They\neat it, that’s what they do! As much as their bellies will hold.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—GAVROCHE ON THE MARCH\n\n\nThe brandishing of a triggerless pistol, grasped in one’s hand in the\nopen street, is so much of a public function that Gavroche felt his\nfervor increasing with every moment. Amid the scraps of the\nMarseillaise which he was singing, he shouted:—\n\n“All goes well. I suffer a great deal in my left paw, I’m all broken up\nwith rheumatism, but I’m satisfied, citizens. All that the bourgeois\nhave to do is to bear themselves well, I’ll sneeze them out subversive\ncouplets. What are the police spies? Dogs. And I’d just like to have\none of them at the end of my pistol. I’m just from the boulevard, my\nfriends. It’s getting hot there, it’s getting into a little boil, it’s\nsimmering. It’s time to skim the pot. Forward march, men! Let an impure\nblood inundate the furrows! I give my days to my country, I shall never\nsee my concubine more, Nini, finished, yes, Nini? But never mind! Long\nlive joy! Let’s fight, crebleu! I’ve had enough of despotism.”\n\n\nAt that moment, the horse of a lancer of the National Guard having\nfallen, Gavroche laid his pistol on the pavement, and picked up the\nman, then he assisted in raising the horse. After which he picked up\nhis pistol and resumed his way. In the Rue de Thorigny, all was peace\nand silence. This apathy, peculiar to the Marais, presented a contrast\nwith the vast surrounding uproar. Four gossips were chatting in a\ndoorway.\n\nScotland has trios of witches, Paris has quartettes of old gossiping\nhags; and the “Thou shalt be King” could be quite as mournfully hurled\nat Bonaparte in the Carrefour Baudoyer as at Macbeth on the heath of\nArmuyr. The croak would be almost identical.\n\nThe gossips of the Rue de Thorigny busied themselves only with their\nown concerns. Three of them were portresses, and the fourth was a\nrag-picker with her basket on her back.\n\nAll four of them seemed to be standing at the four corners of old age,\nwhich are decrepitude, decay, ruin, and sadness.\n\nThe rag-picker was humble. In this open-air society, it is the\nrag-picker who salutes and the portress who patronizes. This is caused\nby the corner for refuse, which is fat or lean, according to the will\nof the portresses, and after the fancy of the one who makes the heap.\nThere may be kindness in the broom.\n\nThis rag-picker was a grateful creature, and she smiled, with what a\nsmile! on the three portresses. Things of this nature were said:—\n\n“Ah, by the way, is your cat still cross?”\n\n\n“Good gracious, cats are naturally the enemies of dogs, you know. It’s\nthe dogs who complain.”\n\n\n“And people also.”\n\n\n“But the fleas from a cat don’t go after people.”\n\n\n“That’s not the trouble, dogs are dangerous. I remember one year when\nthere were so many dogs that it was necessary to put it in the\nnewspapers. That was at the time when there were at the Tuileries great\nsheep that drew the little carriage of the King of Rome. Do you\nremember the King of Rome?”\n\n\n“I liked the Duc de Bordeau better.”\n\n\n“I knew Louis XVIII. I prefer Louis XVIII.”\n\n\n“Meat is awfully dear, isn’t it, Mother Patagon?”\n\n\n“Ah! don’t mention it, the butcher’s shop is a horror. A horrible\nhorror—one can’t afford anything but the poor cuts nowadays.”\n\n\nHere the rag-picker interposed:—\n\n“Ladies, business is dull. The refuse heaps are miserable. No one\nthrows anything away any more. They eat everything.”\n\n\n“There are poorer people than you, la Vargoulême.”\n\n\n“Ah, that’s true,” replied the rag-picker, with deference, “I have a\nprofession.”\n\n\nA pause succeeded, and the rag-picker, yielding to that necessity for\nboasting which lies at the bottom of man, added:—\n\n“In the morning, on my return home, I pick over my basket, I sort my\nthings. This makes heaps in my room. I put the rags in a basket, the\ncores and stalks in a bucket, the linen in my cupboard, the woollen\nstuff in my commode, the old papers in the corner of the window, the\nthings that are good to eat in my bowl, the bits of glass in my\nfireplace, the old shoes behind my door, and the bones under my bed.”\n\n\nGavroche had stopped behind her and was listening.\n\n“Old ladies,” said he, “what do you mean by talking politics?”\n\n\nHe was assailed by a broadside, composed of a quadruple howl.\n\n“Here’s another rascal.”\n\n\n“What’s that he’s got in his paddle? A pistol?”\n\n\n“Well, I’d like to know what sort of a beggar’s brat this is?”\n\n\n“That sort of animal is never easy unless he’s overturning the\nauthorities.”\n\n\nGavroche disdainfully contented himself, by way of reprisal, with\nelevating the tip of his nose with his thumb and opening his hand wide.\n\nThe rag-picker cried:—\n\n“You malicious, bare-pawed little wretch!”\n\n\nThe one who answered to the name of Patagon clapped her hands together\nin horror.\n\n“There’s going to be evil doings, that’s certain. The errand-boy next\ndoor has a little pointed beard, I have seen him pass every day with a\nyoung person in a pink bonnet on his arm; to-day I saw him pass, and he\nhad a gun on his arm. Mame Bacheux says, that last week there was a\nrevolution at—at—at—where’s the calf!—at Pontoise. And then, there you\nsee him, that horrid scamp, with his pistol! It seems that the\nCélestins are full of pistols. What do you suppose the Government can\ndo with good-for-nothings who don’t know how to do anything but\ncontrive ways of upsetting the world, when we had just begun to get a\nlittle quiet after all the misfortunes that have happened, good Lord!\nto that poor queen whom I saw pass in the tumbril! And all this is\ngoing to make tobacco dearer. It’s infamous! And I shall certainly go\nto see him beheaded on the guillotine, the wretch!”\n\n\n“You’ve got the sniffles, old lady,” said Gavroche. “Blow your\npromontory.”\n\n\nAnd he passed on. When he was in the Rue Pavée, the rag-picker occurred\nto his mind, and he indulged in this soliloquy:—\n\n“You’re in the wrong to insult the revolutionists, Mother\nDust-Heap-Corner. This pistol is in your interests. It’s so that you\nmay have more good things to eat in your basket.”\n\n\nAll at once, he heard a shout behind him; it was the portress Patagon\nwho had followed him, and who was shaking her fist at him in the\ndistance and crying:—\n\n“You’re nothing but a bastard.”\n\n\n“Oh! Come now,” said Gavroche, “I don’t care a brass farthing for\nthat!”\n\n\nShortly afterwards, he passed the Hotel Lamoignon. There he uttered\nthis appeal:—\n\n“Forward march to the battle!”\n\n\nAnd he was seized with a fit of melancholy. He gazed at his pistol with\nan air of reproach which seemed an attempt to appease it:—\n\n“I’m going off,” said he, “but you won’t go off!”\n\n\nOne dog may distract the attention from another dog.45 A very gaunt\npoodle came along at the moment. Gavroche felt compassion for him.\n\n“My poor doggy,” said he, “you must have gone and swallowed a cask, for\nall the hoops are visible.”\n\n\nThen he directed his course towards l’Orme-Saint-Gervais.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—JUST INDIGNATION OF A HAIR-DRESSER\n\n\nThe worthy hair-dresser who had chased from his shop the two little\nfellows to whom Gavroche had opened the paternal interior of the\nelephant was at that moment in his shop engaged in shaving an old\nsoldier of the legion who had served under the Empire. They were\ntalking. The hair-dresser had, naturally, spoken to the veteran of the\nriot, then of General Lamarque, and from Lamarque they had passed to\nthe Emperor. Thence sprang up a conversation between barber and soldier\nwhich Prudhomme, had he been present, would have enriched with\narabesques, and which he would have entitled: “Dialogue between the\nrazor and the sword.”\n\n\n“How did the Emperor ride, sir?” said the barber.\n\n“Badly. He did not know how to fall—so he never fell.”\n\n\n“Did he have fine horses? He must have had fine horses!”\n\n\n“On the day when he gave me my cross, I noticed his beast. It was a\nracing mare, perfectly white. Her ears were very wide apart, her saddle\ndeep, a fine head marked with a black star, a very long neck, strongly\narticulated knees, prominent ribs, oblique shoulders and a powerful\ncrupper. A little more than fifteen hands in height.”\n\n\n“A pretty horse,” remarked the hair-dresser.\n\n“It was His Majesty’s beast.”\n\n\nThe hair-dresser felt, that after this observation, a short silence\nwould be fitting, so he conformed himself to it, and then went on:—\n\n“The Emperor was never wounded but once, was he, sir?”\n\n\nThe old soldier replied with the calm and sovereign tone of a man who\nhad been there:—\n\n“In the heel. At Ratisbon. I never saw him so well dressed as on that\nday. He was as neat as a new sou.”\n\n\n“And you, Mr. Veteran, you must have been often wounded?”\n\n\n“I?” said the soldier, “ah! not to amount to anything. At Marengo, I\nreceived two sabre-blows on the back of my neck, a bullet in the right\narm at Austerlitz, another in the left hip at Jena. At Friedland, a\nthrust from a bayonet, there,—at the Moskowa seven or eight\nlance-thrusts, no matter where, at Lutzen a splinter of a shell crushed\none of my fingers. Ah! and then at Waterloo, a ball from a biscaïen in\nthe thigh, that’s all.”\n\n\n“How fine that is!” exclaimed the hair-dresser, in Pindaric accents,\n“to die on the field of battle! On my word of honor, rather than die in\nbed, of an illness, slowly, a bit by bit each day, with drugs,\ncataplasms, syringes, medicines, I should prefer to receive a\ncannon-ball in my belly!”\n\n\n“You’re not over fastidious,” said the soldier.\n\nHe had hardly spoken when a fearful crash shook the shop. The\nshow-window had suddenly been fractured.\n\nThe wig-maker turned pale.\n\n“Ah, good God!” he exclaimed, “it’s one of them!”\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“A cannon-ball.”\n\n\n“Here it is,” said the soldier.\n\nAnd he picked up something that was rolling about the floor. It was a\npebble.\n\nThe hair-dresser ran to the broken window and beheld Gavroche fleeing\nat the full speed, towards the Marché Saint-Jean. As he passed the\nhair-dresser’s shop Gavroche, who had the two brats still in his mind,\nhad not been able to resist the impulse to say good day to him, and had\nflung a stone through his panes.\n\n“You see!” shrieked the hair-dresser, who from white had turned blue,\n“that fellow returns and does mischief for the pure pleasure of it.\nWhat has any one done to that gamin?”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—THE CHILD IS AMAZED AT THE OLD MAN\n\n\nIn the meantime, in the Marché Saint-Jean, where the post had already\nbeen disarmed, Gavroche had just “effected a junction” with a band led\nby Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Combeferre, and Feuilly. They were armed after\na fashion. Bahorel and Jean Prouvaire had found them and swelled the\ngroup. Enjolras had a double-barrelled hunting-gun, Combeferre the gun\nof a National Guard bearing the number of his legion, and in his belt,\ntwo pistols which his unbuttoned coat allowed to be seen, Jean\nProuvaire an old cavalry musket, Bahorel a rifle; Courfeyrac was\nbrandishing an unsheathed sword-cane. Feuilly, with a naked sword in\nhis hand, marched at their head shouting: “Long live Poland!”\n\n\nThey reached the Quai Morland. Cravatless, hatless, breathless, soaked\nby the rain, with lightning in their eyes. Gavroche accosted them\ncalmly:—\n\n“Where are we going?”\n\n\n“Come along,” said Courfeyrac.\n\nBehind Feuilly marched, or rather bounded, Bahorel, who was like a fish\nin water in a riot. He wore a scarlet waistcoat, and indulged in the\nsort of words which break everything. His waistcoat astounded a\npasser-by, who cried in bewilderment:—\n\n“Here are the reds!”\n\n\n“The reds, the reds!” retorted Bahorel. “A queer kind of fear,\nbourgeois. For my part I don’t tremble before a poppy, the little red\nhat inspires me with no alarm. Take my advice, bourgeois, let’s leave\nfear of the red to horned cattle.”\n\n\nHe caught sight of a corner of the wall on which was placarded the most\npeaceable sheet of paper in the world, a permission to eat eggs, a\nLenten admonition addressed by the Archbishop of Paris to his “flock.”\n\n\nBahorel exclaimed:—\n\n“‘Flock’; a polite way of saying geese.”\n\n\nAnd he tore the charge from the nail. This conquered Gavroche. From\nthat instant Gavroche set himself to study Bahorel.\n\n“Bahorel,” observed Enjolras, “you are wrong. You should have let that\ncharge alone, he is not the person with whom we have to deal, you are\nwasting your wrath to no purpose. Take care of your supply. One does\nnot fire out of the ranks with the soul any more than with a gun.”\n\n\n“Each one in his own fashion, Enjolras,” retorted Bahorel. “This\nbishop’s prose shocks me; I want to eat eggs without being permitted.\nYour style is the hot and cold; I am amusing myself. Besides, I’m not\nwasting myself, I’m getting a start; and if I tore down that charge,\nHercle! ‘twas only to whet my appetite.”\n\n\nThis word, _Hercle_, struck Gavroche. He sought all occasions for\nlearning, and that tearer-down of posters possessed his esteem. He\ninquired of him:—\n\n“What does _Hercle_ mean?”\n\n\nBahorel answered:—\n\n“It means cursed name of a dog, in Latin.”\n\n\nHere Bahorel recognized at a window a pale young man with a black beard\nwho was watching them as they passed, probably a Friend of the A B C.\nHe shouted to him:—\n\n“Quick, cartridges, _para bellum_.”\n\n\n“A fine man! that’s true,” said Gavroche, who now understood Latin.\n\nA tumultuous retinue accompanied them,—students, artists, young men\naffiliated to the Cougourde of Aix, artisans, longshoremen, armed with\nclubs and bayonets; some, like Combeferre, with pistols thrust into\ntheir trousers.\n\nAn old man, who appeared to be extremely aged, was walking in the band.\n\nHe had no arms, and he made great haste, so that he might not be left\nbehind, although he had a thoughtful air.\n\nGavroche caught sight of him:—\n\n“Keksekça?” said he to Courfeyrac.\n\n“He’s an old duffer.”\n\n\nIt was M. Mabeuf.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—THE OLD MAN\n\n\nLet us recount what had taken place.\n\nEnjolras and his friends had been on the Boulevard Bourdon, near the\npublic storehouses, at the moment when the dragoons had made their\ncharge. Enjolras, Courfeyrac, and Combeferre were among those who had\ntaken to the Rue Bassompierre, shouting: “To the barricades!” In the\nRue Lesdiguières they had met an old man walking along. What had\nattracted their attention was that the goodman was walking in a\nzig-zag, as though he were intoxicated. Moreover, he had his hat in his\nhand, although it had been raining all the morning, and was raining\npretty briskly at the very time. Courfeyrac had recognized Father\nMabeuf. He knew him through having many times accompanied Marius as far\nas his door. As he was acquainted with the peaceful and more than timid\nhabits of the old beadle-book-collector, and was amazed at the sight of\nhim in the midst of that uproar, a couple of paces from the cavalry\ncharges, almost in the midst of a fusillade, hatless in the rain, and\nstrolling about among the bullets, he had accosted him, and the\nfollowing dialogue had been exchanged between the rioter of fire and\nthe octogenarian:—\n\n“M. Mabeuf, go to your home.”\n\n\n“Why?”\n\n\n“There’s going to be a row.”\n\n\n“That’s well.”\n\n\n“Thrusts with the sword and firing, M. Mabeuf.”\n\n\n“That is well.”\n\n\n“Firing from cannon.”\n\n\n“That is good. Where are the rest of you going?”\n\n\n“We are going to fling the government to the earth.”\n\n\n“That is good.”\n\n\nAnd he had set out to follow them. From that moment forth he had not\nuttered a word. His step had suddenly become firm; artisans had offered\nhim their arms; he had refused with a sign of the head. He advanced\nnearly to the front rank of the column, with the movement of a man who\nis marching and the countenance of a man who is sleeping.\n\n“What a fierce old fellow!” muttered the students. The rumor spread\nthrough the troop that he was a former member of the Convention,—an old\nregicide. The mob had turned in through the Rue de la Verrerie.\n\nLittle Gavroche marched in front with that deafening song which made of\nhim a sort of trumpet.\n\nHe sang:\n“Voici la lune qui paraît,\nQuand irons-nous dans la forêt?\nDemandait Charlot à Charlotte.\n\nTou tou tou\nPour Chatou.\nJe n’ai qu’un Dieu, qu’un roi, qu’un liard, et qu’une botte.\n\n“Pour avoir bu de grand matin\nLa rosée à même le thym,\nDeux moineaux étaient en ribotte.\n\nZi zi zi\nPour Passy.\nJe n’ai qu’un Dieu, qu’un roi, qu’un liard, et qu’une botte.\n\n“Et ces deux pauvres petits loups,\nComme deux grives étaient soûls;\nUn tigre en riait dans sa grotte.\n\nDon don don\nPour Meudon.\nJe n’ai qu’un Dieu, qu’un roi, qu’un liard, et qu’une botte.\n\n“L’un jurait et l’autre sacrait.\nQuand irons nous dans la forêt?\nDemandait Charlot à Charlotte.\n\nTin tin tin\nPour Pantin.\nJe n’ai qu’un Dieu, qu’un roi, qu’un liard, et qu’une botte.\"46\n\n\nThey directed their course towards Saint-Merry.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—RECRUITS\n\n\nThe band augmented every moment. Near the Rue des Billettes, a man of\nlofty stature, whose hair was turning gray, and whose bold and daring\nmien was remarked by Courfeyrac, Enjolras, and Combeferre, but whom\nnone of them knew, joined them. Gavroche, who was occupied in singing,\nwhistling, humming, running on ahead and pounding on the shutters of\nthe shops with the butt of his triggerless pistol; paid no attention to\nthis man.\n\nIt chanced that in the Rue de la Verrerie, they passed in front of\nCourfeyrac’s door.\n\n“This happens just right,” said Courfeyrac, “I have forgotten my purse,\nand I have lost my hat.”\n\n\nHe quitted the mob and ran up to his quarters at full speed. He seized\nan old hat and his purse.\n\nHe also seized a large square coffer, of the dimensions of a large\nvalise, which was concealed under his soiled linen.\n\nAs he descended again at a run, the portress hailed him:—\n\n“Monsieur de Courfeyrac!”\n\n\n“What’s your name, portress?”\n\n\nThe portress stood bewildered.\n\n“Why, you know perfectly well, I’m the concierge; my name is Mother\nVeuvain.”\n\n\n“Well, if you call me Monsieur de Courfeyrac again, I shall call you\nMother de Veuvain. Now speak, what’s the matter? What do you want?”\n\n\n“There is some one who wants to speak with you.”\n\n\n“Who is it?”\n\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n\n“Where is he?”\n\n\n“In my lodge.”\n\n\n“The devil!” ejaculated Courfeyrac.\n\n“But the person has been waiting your return for over an hour,” said\nthe portress.\n\nAt the same time, a sort of pale, thin, small, freckled, and youthful\nartisan, clad in a tattered blouse and patched trousers of ribbed\nvelvet, and who had rather the air of a girl accoutred as a man than of\na man, emerged from the lodge and said to Courfeyrac in a voice which\nwas not the least in the world like a woman’s voice:—\n\n“Monsieur Marius, if you please.”\n\n\n“He is not here.”\n\n\n“Will he return this evening?”\n\n\n“I know nothing about it.”\n\n\nAnd Courfeyrac added:—\n\n“For my part, I shall not return.”\n\n\nThe young man gazed steadily at him and said:—\n\n“Why not?”\n\n\n“Because.”\n\n\n“Where are you going, then?”\n\n\n“What business is that of yours?”\n\n\n“Would you like to have me carry your coffer for you?”\n\n\n“I am going to the barricades.”\n\n\n“Would you like to have me go with you?”\n\n\n“If you like!” replied Courfeyrac. “The street is free, the pavements\nbelong to every one.”\n\n\nAnd he made his escape at a run to join his friends. When he had\nrejoined them, he gave the coffer to one of them to carry. It was only\na quarter of an hour after this that he saw the young man, who had\nactually followed them.\n\nA mob does not go precisely where it intends. We have explained that a\ngust of wind carries it away. They overshot Saint-Merry and found\nthemselves, without precisely knowing how, in the Rue Saint-Denis.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK TWELFTH—CORINTHE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—HISTORY OF CORINTHE FROM ITS FOUNDATION\n\n\nThe Parisians who nowadays on entering on the Rue Rambuteau at the end\nnear the Halles, notice on their right, opposite the Rue Mondétour, a\nbasket-maker’s shop having for its sign a basket in the form of\nNapoleon the Great with this inscription:—\n\nNAPOLEON IS MADE\nWHOLLY OF WILLOW,\n\n\nhave no suspicion of the terrible scenes which this very spot witnessed\nhardly thirty years ago.\n\nIt was there that lay the Rue de la Chanvrerie, which ancient deeds\nspell Chanverrerie, and the celebrated public-house called _Corinthe_.\n\nThe reader will remember all that has been said about the barricade\neffected at this point, and eclipsed, by the way, by the barricade\nSaint-Merry. It was on this famous barricade of the Rue de la\nChanvrerie, now fallen into profound obscurity, that we are about to\nshed a little light.\n\nMay we be permitted to recur, for the sake of clearness in the recital,\nto the simple means which we have already employed in the case of\nWaterloo. Persons who wish to picture to themselves in a tolerably\nexact manner the constitution of the houses which stood at that epoch\nnear the Pointe Saint-Eustache, at the northeast angle of the Halles of\nParis, where to-day lies the embouchure of the Rue Rambuteau, have only\nto imagine an N touching the Rue Saint-Denis with its summit and the\nHalles with its base, and whose two vertical bars should form the Rue\nde la Grande-Truanderie, and the Rue de la Chanvrerie, and whose\ntransverse bar should be formed by the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie. The\nold Rue Mondétour cut the three strokes of the N at the most crooked\nangles. So that the labyrinthine confusion of these four streets\nsufficed to form, on a space three fathoms square, between the Halles\nand the Rue Saint-Denis on the one hand, and between the Rue du Cygne\nand the Rue des Prêcheurs on the other, seven islands of houses, oddly\ncut up, of varying sizes, placed crosswise and hap-hazard, and barely\nseparated, like the blocks of stone in a dock, by narrow crannies.\n\nWe say narrow crannies, and we can give no more just idea of those\ndark, contracted, many-angled alleys, lined with eight-story buildings.\nThese buildings were so decrepit that, in the Rue de la Chanvrerie and\nthe Rue de la Petite-Truanderie, the fronts were shored up with beams\nrunning from one house to another. The street was narrow and the gutter\nbroad, the pedestrian there walked on a pavement that was always wet,\nskirting little stalls resembling cellars, big posts encircled with\niron hoops, excessive heaps of refuse, and gates armed with enormous,\ncentury-old gratings. The Rue Rambuteau has devastated all that.\n\nThe name of Mondétour paints marvellously well the sinuosities of that\nwhole set of streets. A little further on, they are found still better\nexpressed by the _Rue Pirouette_, which ran into the Rue Mondétour.\n\nThe passer-by who got entangled from the Rue Saint-Denis in the Rue de\nla Chanvrerie beheld it gradually close in before him as though he had\nentered an elongated funnel. At the end of this street, which was very\nshort, he found further passage barred in the direction of the Halles\nby a tall row of houses, and he would have thought himself in a blind\nalley, had he not perceived on the right and left two dark cuts through\nwhich he could make his escape. This was the Rue Mondétour, which on\none side ran into the Rue de Prêcheurs, and on the other into the Rue\ndu Cygne and the Petite-Truanderie. At the bottom of this sort of\ncul-de-sac, at the angle of the cutting on the right, there was to be\nseen a house which was not so tall as the rest, and which formed a sort\nof cape in the street. It is in this house, of two stories only, that\nan illustrious wine-shop had been merrily installed three hundred years\nbefore. This tavern created a joyous noise in the very spot which old\nTheophilus described in the following couplet:—\n\nLà branle le squelette horrible\nD’un pauvre amant qui se pendit.47\n\n\nThe situation was good, and tavern-keepers succeeded each other there,\nfrom father to son.\n\nIn the time of Mathurin Regnier, this cabaret was called the\n_Pot-aux-Roses_, and as the rebus was then in fashion, it had for its\nsign-board, a post (_poteau_) painted rose-color. In the last century,\nthe worthy Natoire, one of the fantastic masters nowadays despised by\nthe stiff school, having got drunk many times in this wine-shop at the\nvery table where Regnier had drunk his fill, had painted, by way of\ngratitude, a bunch of Corinth grapes on the pink post. The keeper of\nthe cabaret, in his joy, had changed his device and had caused to be\nplaced in gilt letters beneath the bunch these words: “At the Bunch of\nCorinth Grapes” (_“Au Raisin de Corinthe”_). Hence the name of\nCorinthe. Nothing is more natural to drunken men than ellipses. The\nellipsis is the zig-zag of the phrase. Corinthe gradually dethroned the\nPot-aux-Roses. The last proprietor of the dynasty, Father Hucheloup, no\nlonger acquainted even with the tradition, had the post painted blue.\n\nA room on the ground floor, where the bar was situated, one on the\nfirst floor containing a billiard-table, a wooden spiral staircase\npiercing the ceiling, wine on the tables, smoke on the walls, candles\nin broad daylight,—this was the style of this cabaret. A staircase with\na trap-door in the lower room led to the cellar. On the second floor\nwere the lodgings of the Hucheloup family. They were reached by a\nstaircase which was a ladder rather than a staircase, and had for their\nentrance only a private door in the large room on the first floor.\nUnder the roof, in two mansard attics, were the nests for the servants.\nThe kitchen shared the ground floor with the tap-room.\n\nFather Hucheloup had, possibly, been born a chemist, but the fact is\nthat he was a cook; people did not confine themselves to drinking alone\nin his wine-shop, they also ate there. Hucheloup had invented a capital\nthing which could be eaten nowhere but in his house, stuffed carps,\nwhich he called _carpes au gras_. These were eaten by the light of a\ntallow candle or of a lamp of the time of Louis XVI., on tables to\nwhich were nailed waxed cloths in lieu of table-cloths. People came\nthither from a distance. Hucheloup, one fine morning, had seen fit to\nnotify passers-by of this “specialty”; he had dipped a brush in a pot\nof black paint, and as he was an orthographer on his own account, as\nwell as a cook after his own fashion, he had improvised on his wall\nthis remarkable inscription:—\n\nCARPES HO GRAS.\n\nOne winter, the rain-storms and the showers had taken a fancy to\nobliterate the S which terminated the first word, and the G which began\nthe third; this is what remained:—\n\nCARPE HO RAS.\n\nTime and rain assisting, a humble gastronomical announcement had become\na profound piece of advice.\n\nIn this way it came about, that though he knew no French, Father\nHucheloup understood Latin, that he had evoked philosophy from his\nkitchen, and that, desirous simply of effacing Lent, he had equalled\nHorace. And the striking thing about it was, that that also meant:\n“Enter my wine-shop.”\n\n\nNothing of all this is in existence now. The Mondétour labyrinth was\ndisembowelled and widely opened in 1847, and probably no longer exists\nat the present moment. The Rue de la Chanvrerie and Corinthe have\ndisappeared beneath the pavement of the Rue Rambuteau.\n\nAs we have already said, Corinthe was the meeting-place if not the\nrallying-point, of Courfeyrac and his friends. It was Grantaire who had\ndiscovered Corinthe. He had entered it on account of the _Carpe horas_,\nand had returned thither on account of the _Carpes au gras_. There they\ndrank, there they ate, there they shouted; they did not pay much, they\npaid badly, they did not pay at all, but they were always welcome.\nFather Hucheloup was a jovial host.\n\nHucheloup, that amiable man, as was just said, was a wine-shop-keeper\nwith a moustache; an amusing variety. He always had an ill-tempered\nair, seemed to wish to intimidate his customers, grumbled at the people\nwho entered his establishment, and had rather the mien of seeking a\nquarrel with them than of serving them with soup. And yet, we insist\nupon the word, people were always welcome there. This oddity had\nattracted customers to his shop, and brought him young men, who said to\neach other: “Come hear Father Hucheloup growl.” He had been a\nfencing-master. All of a sudden, he would burst out laughing. A big\nvoice, a good fellow. He had a comic foundation under a tragic\nexterior, he asked nothing better than to frighten you, very much like\nthose snuff-boxes which are in the shape of a pistol. The detonation\nmakes one sneeze.\n\nMother Hucheloup, his wife, was a bearded and a very homely creature.\n\nAbout 1830, Father Hucheloup died. With him disappeared the secret of\nstuffed carps. His inconsolable widow continued to keep the wine-shop.\nBut the cooking deteriorated, and became execrable; the wine, which had\nalways been bad, became fearfully bad. Nevertheless, Courfeyrac and his\nfriends continued to go to Corinthe,—out of pity, as Bossuet said.\n\nThe Widow Hucheloup was breathless and misshapen and given to rustic\nrecollections. She deprived them of their flatness by her\npronunciation. She had a way of her own of saying things, which spiced\nher reminiscences of the village and of her springtime. It had formerly\nbeen her delight, so she affirmed, to hear the _loups-de-gorge_\n(_rouges-gorges_) _chanter dans les ogrepines_ (_aubépines_)—to hear\nthe redbreasts sing in the hawthorn-trees.\n\nThe hall on the first floor, where “the restaurant” was situated, was a\nlarge and long apartment encumbered with stools, chairs, benches, and\ntables, and with a crippled, lame, old billiard-table. It was reached\nby a spiral staircase which terminated in the corner of the room at a\nsquare hole like the hatchway of a ship.\n\nThis room, lighted by a single narrow window, and by a lamp that was\nalways burning, had the air of a garret. All the four-footed furniture\ncomported itself as though it had but three legs—the whitewashed walls\nhad for their only ornament the following quatrain in honor of Mame\nHucheloup:—\n\nElle étonne à dix pas, elle épouvente à deux,\nUne verrue habite en son nez hasardeux;\nOn tremble à chaque instant qu’elle ne vous la mouche\nEt qu’un beau jour son nez ne tombe dans sa bouche.48\n\n\nThis was scrawled in charcoal on the wall.\n\nMame Hucheloup, a good likeness, went and came from morning till night\nbefore this quatrain with the most perfect tranquillity. Two\nserving-maids, named Matelote and Gibelotte,49 and who had never been\nknown by any other names, helped Mame Hucheloup to set on the tables\nthe jugs of poor wine, and the various broths which were served to the\nhungry patrons in earthenware bowls. Matelote, large, plump, redhaired,\nand noisy, the favorite ex-sultana of the defunct Hucheloup, was\nhomelier than any mythological monster, be it what it may; still, as it\nbecomes the servant to always keep in the rear of the mistress, she was\nless homely than Mame Hucheloup. Gibelotte, tall, delicate, white with\na lymphatic pallor, with circles round her eyes, and drooping lids,\nalways languid and weary, afflicted with what may be called chronic\nlassitude, the first up in the house and the last in bed, waited on\nevery one, even the other maid, silently and gently, smiling through\nher fatigue with a vague and sleepy smile.\n\nBefore entering the restaurant room, the visitor read on the door the\nfollowing line written there in chalk by Courfeyrac:—\n\nRégale si tu peux et mange si tu l’oses.50\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—PRELIMINARY GAYETIES\n\n\nLaigle de Meaux, as the reader knows, lived more with Joly than\nelsewhere. He had a lodging, as a bird has one on a branch. The two\nfriends lived together, ate together, slept together. They had\neverything in common, even Musichetta, to some extent. They were, what\nthe subordinate monks who accompany monks are called, _bini_. On the\nmorning of the 5th of June, they went to Corinthe to breakfast. Joly,\nwho was all stuffed up, had a catarrh which Laigle was beginning to\nshare. Laigle’s coat was threadbare, but Joly was well dressed.\n\nIt was about nine o’clock in the morning, when they opened the door of\nCorinthe.\n\nThey ascended to the first floor.\n\nMatelote and Gibelotte received them.\n\n“Oysters, cheese, and ham,” said Laigle.\n\nAnd they seated themselves at a table.\n\nThe wine-shop was empty; there was no one there but themselves.\n\nGibelotte, knowing Joly and Laigle, set a bottle of wine on the table.\n\nWhile they were busy with their first oysters, a head appeared at the\nhatchway of the staircase, and a voice said:—\n\n“I am passing by. I smell from the street a delicious odor of Brie\ncheese. I enter.” It was Grantaire.\n\nGrantaire took a stool and drew up to the table.\n\nAt the sight of Grantaire, Gibelotte placed two bottles of wine on the\ntable.\n\nThat made three.\n\n“Are you going to drink those two bottles?” Laigle inquired of\nGrantaire.\n\nGrantaire replied:—\n\n“All are ingenious, thou alone art ingenuous. Two bottles never yet\nastonished a man.”\n\n\nThe others had begun by eating, Grantaire began by drinking. Half a\nbottle was rapidly gulped down.\n\n“So you have a hole in your stomach?” began Laigle again.\n\n“You have one in your elbow,” said Grantaire.\n\nAnd after having emptied his glass, he added:—\n\n“Ah, by the way, Laigle of the funeral oration, your coat is old.”\n\n\n“I should hope so,” retorted Laigle. “That’s why we get on well\ntogether, my coat and I. It has acquired all my folds, it does not bind\nme anywhere, it is moulded on my deformities, it falls in with all my\nmovements, I am only conscious of it because it keeps me warm. Old\ncoats are just like old friends.”\n\n\n“That’s true,” ejaculated Joly, striking into the dialogue, “an old\ngoat is an old abi” (_ami_, friend).\n\n“Especially in the mouth of a man whose head is stuffed up,” said\nGrantaire.\n\n“Grantaire,” demanded Laigle, “have you just come from the boulevard?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“We have just seen the head of the procession pass, Joly and I.”\n\n\n“It’s a marvellous sight,” said Joly.\n\n“How quiet this street is!” exclaimed Laigle. “Who would suspect that\nParis was turned upside down? How plainly it is to be seen that in\nformer days there were nothing but convents here! In this neighborhood!\nDu Breul and Sauval give a list of them, and so does the Abbé Lebeuf.\nThey were all round here, they fairly swarmed, booted and barefooted,\nshaven, bearded, gray, black, white, Franciscans, Minims, Capuchins,\nCarmelites, Little Augustines, Great Augustines, old Augustines—there\nwas no end of them.”\n\n\n“Don’t let’s talk of monks,” interrupted Grantaire, “it makes one want\nto scratch one’s self.”\n\n\nThen he exclaimed:—\n\n“Bouh! I’ve just swallowed a bad oyster. Now hypochondria is taking\npossession of me again. The oysters are spoiled, the servants are ugly.\nI hate the human race. I just passed through the Rue Richelieu, in\nfront of the big public library. That pile of oyster-shells which is\ncalled a library is disgusting even to think of. What paper! What ink!\nWhat scrawling! And all that has been written! What rascal was it who\nsaid that man was a featherless biped?51 And then, I met a pretty girl\nof my acquaintance, who is as beautiful as the spring, worthy to be\ncalled Floréal, and who is delighted, enraptured, as happy as the\nangels, because a wretch yesterday, a frightful banker all spotted with\nsmall-pox, deigned to take a fancy to her! Alas! woman keeps on the\nwatch for a protector as much as for a lover; cats chase mice as well\nas birds. Two months ago that young woman was virtuous in an attic, she\nadjusted little brass rings in the eyelet-holes of corsets, what do you\ncall it? She sewed, she had a camp bed, she dwelt beside a pot of\nflowers, she was contented. Now here she is a bankeress. This\ntransformation took place last night. I met the victim this morning in\nhigh spirits. The hideous point about it is, that the jade is as pretty\nto-day as she was yesterday. Her financier did not show in her face.\nRoses have this advantage or disadvantage over women, that the traces\nleft upon them by caterpillars are visible. Ah! there is no morality on\nearth. I call to witness the myrtle, the symbol of love, the laurel,\nthe symbol of air, the olive, that ninny, the symbol of peace, the\napple-tree which came nearest rangling Adam with its pips, and the\nfig-tree, the grandfather of petticoats. As for right, do you know what\nright is? The Gauls covet Clusium, Rome protects Clusium, and demands\nwhat wrong Clusium has done to them. Brennus answers: ‘The wrong that\nAlba did to you, the wrong that Fidenæ did to you, the wrong that the\nEques, the Volsci, and the Sabines have done to you. They were your\nneighbors. The Clusians are ours. We understand neighborliness just as\nyou do. You have stolen Alba, we shall take Clusium.’ Rome said: ‘You\nshall not take Clusium.’ Brennus took Rome. Then he cried: ‘Væ victis!’\nThat is what right is. Ah! what beasts of prey there are in this world!\nWhat eagles! It makes my flesh creep.”\n\n\nHe held out his glass to Joly, who filled it, then he drank and went\non, having hardly been interrupted by this glass of wine, of which no\none, not even himself, had taken any notice:—\n\n“Brennus, who takes Rome, is an eagle; the banker who takes the\ngrisette is an eagle. There is no more modesty in the one case than in\nthe other. So we believe in nothing. There is but one reality: drink.\nWhatever your opinion may be in favor of the lean cock, like the Canton\nof Uri, or in favor of the fat cock, like the Canton of Glaris, it\nmatters little, drink. You talk to me of the boulevard, of that\nprocession, _et cætera, et cætera_. Come now, is there going to be\nanother revolution? This poverty of means on the part of the good God\nastounds me. He has to keep greasing the groove of events every moment.\nThere is a hitch, it won’t work. Quick, a revolution! The good God has\nhis hands perpetually black with that cart-grease. If I were in his\nplace, I’d be perfectly simple about it, I would not wind up my\nmechanism every minute, I’d lead the human race in a straightforward\nway, I’d weave matters mesh by mesh, without breaking the thread, I\nwould have no provisional arrangements, I would have no extraordinary\nrepertory. What the rest of you call progress advances by means of two\nmotors, men and events. But, sad to say, from time to time, the\nexceptional becomes necessary. The ordinary troupe suffices neither for\nevent nor for men: among men geniuses are required, among events\nrevolutions. Great accidents are the law; the order of things cannot do\nwithout them; and, judging from the apparition of comets, one would be\ntempted to think that Heaven itself finds actors needed for its\nperformance. At the moment when one expects it the least, God placards\na meteor on the wall of the firmament. Some queer star turns up,\nunderlined by an enormous tail. And that causes the death of Cæsar.\nBrutus deals him a blow with a knife, and God a blow with a comet.\n_Crac_, and behold an aurora borealis, behold a revolution, behold a\ngreat man; ’93 in big letters, Napoleon on guard, the comet of 1811 at\nthe head of the poster. Ah! what a beautiful blue theatre all studded\nwith unexpected flashes! Boum! Boum! extraordinary show! Raise your\neyes, boobies. Everything is in disorder, the star as well as the\ndrama. Good God, it is too much and not enough. These resources,\ngathered from exception, seem magnificence and poverty. My friends,\nProvidence has come down to expedients. What does a revolution prove?\nThat God is in a quandry. He effects a _coup d‘état_ because he, God,\nhas not been able to make both ends meet. In fact, this confirms me in\nmy conjectures as to Jehovah’s fortune; and when I see so much distress\nin heaven and on earth, from the bird who has not a grain of millet to\nmyself without a hundred thousand livres of income, when I see human\ndestiny, which is very badly worn, and even royal destiny, which is\nthreadbare, witness the Prince de Condé hung, when I see winter, which\nis nothing but a rent in the zenith through which the wind blows, when\nI see so many rags even in the perfectly new purple of the morning on\nthe crests of hills, when I see the drops of dew, those mock pearls,\nwhen I see the frost, that paste, when I see humanity ripped apart and\nevents patched up, and so many spots on the sun and so many holes in\nthe moon, when I see so much misery everywhere, I suspect that God is\nnot rich. The appearance exists, it is true, but I feel that he is hard\nup. He gives a revolution as a tradesman whose money-box is empty gives\na ball. God must not be judged from appearances. Beneath the gilding of\nheaven I perceive a poverty-stricken universe. Creation is bankrupt.\nThat is why I am discontented. Here it is the 4th of June, it is almost\nnight; ever since this morning I have been waiting for daylight to\ncome; it has not come, and I bet that it won’t come all day. This is\nthe inexactness of an ill-paid clerk. Yes, everything is badly\narranged, nothing fits anything else, this old world is all warped, I\ntake my stand on the opposition, everything goes awry; the universe is\na tease. It’s like children, those who want them have none, and those\nwho don’t want them have them. Total: I’m vexed. Besides, Laigle de\nMeaux, that bald-head, offends my sight. It humiliates me to think that\nI am of the same age as that baldy. However, I criticise, but I do not\ninsult. The universe is what it is. I speak here without evil intent\nand to ease my conscience. Receive, Eternal Father, the assurance of my\ndistinguished consideration. Ah! by all the saints of Olympus and by\nall the gods of paradise, I was not intended to be a Parisian, that is\nto say, to rebound forever, like a shuttlecock between two battledores,\nfrom the group of the loungers to the group of the roysterers. I was\nmade to be a Turk, watching oriental houris all day long, executing\nthose exquisite Egyptian dances, as sensuous as the dream of a chaste\nman, or a Beauceron peasant, or a Venetian gentleman surrounded by\ngentlewoman, or a petty German prince, furnishing the half of a\nfoot-soldier to the Germanic confederation, and occupying his leisure\nwith drying his breeches on his hedge, that is to say, his frontier.\nThose are the positions for which I was born! Yes, I have said a Turk,\nand I will not retract. I do not understand how people can habitually\ntake Turks in bad part; Mohammed had his good points; respect for the\ninventor of seraglios with houris and paradises with odalisques! Let us\nnot insult Mohammedanism, the only religion which is ornamented with a\nhen-roost! Now, I insist on a drink. The earth is a great piece of\nstupidity. And it appears that they are going to fight, all those\nimbeciles, and to break each other’s profiles and to massacre each\nother in the heart of summer, in the month of June, when they might go\noff with a creature on their arm, to breathe the immense heaps of\nnew-mown hay in the meadows! Really, people do commit altogether too\nmany follies. An old broken lantern which I have just seen at a\nbric-à-brac merchant’s suggests a reflection to my mind; it is time to\nenlighten the human race. Yes, behold me sad again. That’s what comes\nof swallowing an oyster and a revolution the wrong way! I am growing\nmelancholy once more. Oh! frightful old world. People strive, turn each\nother out, prostitute themselves, kill each other, and get used to it!”\n\n\nAnd Grantaire, after this fit of eloquence, had a fit of coughing,\nwhich was well earned.\n\n“À propos of revolution,” said Joly, “it is decidedly abberent that\nBarius is in lub.”\n\n\n“Does any one know with whom?” demanded Laigle.\n\n“Do.”\n\n\n“No?”\n\n\n“Do! I tell you.”\n\n\n“Marius’ love affairs!” exclaimed Grantaire. “I can imagine it. Marius\nis a fog, and he must have found a vapor. Marius is of the race of\npoets. He who says poet, says fool, madman, _Tymbræus Apollo_. Marius\nand his Marie, or his Marion, or his Maria, or his Mariette. They must\nmake a queer pair of lovers. I know just what it is like. Ecstasies in\nwhich they forget to kiss. Pure on earth, but joined in heaven. They\nare souls possessed of senses. They lie among the stars.”\n\n\nGrantaire was attacking his second bottle and, possibly, his second\nharangue, when a new personage emerged from the square aperture of the\nstairs. It was a boy less than ten years of age, ragged, very small,\nyellow, with an odd phiz, a vivacious eye, an enormous amount of hair\ndrenched with rain, and wearing a contented air.\n\nThe child unhesitatingly making his choice among the three, addressed\nhimself to Laigle de Meaux.\n\n“Are you Monsieur Bossuet?”\n\n\n“That is my nickname,” replied Laigle. “What do you want with me?”\n\n\n“This. A tall blonde fellow on the boulevard said to me: ‘Do you know\nMother Hucheloup?’ I said: ‘Yes, Rue Chanvrerie, the old man’s widow;’\nhe said to me: ‘Go there. There you will find M. Bossuet. Tell him from\nme: “A B C”.’ It’s a joke that they’re playing on you, isn’t it. He\ngave me ten sous.”\n\n\n“Joly, lend me ten sous,” said Laigle; and, turning to Grantaire:\n“Grantaire, lend me ten sous.”\n\n\nThis made twenty sous, which Laigle handed to the lad.\n\n“Thank you, sir,” said the urchin.\n\n“What is your name?” inquired Laigle.\n\n“Navet, Gavroche’s friend.”\n\n\n“Stay with us,” said Laigle.\n\n“Breakfast with us,” said Grantaire.\n\nThe child replied:—\n\n“I can’t, I belong in the procession, I’m the one to shout ‘Down with\nPolignac!’”\n\n\nAnd executing a prolonged scrape of his foot behind him, which is the\nmost respectful of all possible salutes, he took his departure.\n\nThe child gone, Grantaire took the word:—\n\n“That is the pure-bred gamin. There are a great many varieties of the\ngamin species. The notary’s gamin is called Skip-the-Gutter, the cook’s\ngamin is called a scullion, the baker’s gamin is called a _mitron_, the\nlackey’s gamin is called a groom, the marine gamin is called the\ncabin-boy, the soldier’s gamin is called the drummer-boy, the painter’s\ngamin is called paint-grinder, the tradesman’s gamin is called an\nerrand-boy, the courtesan gamin is called the minion, the kingly gamin\nis called the dauphin, the god gamin is called the bambino.”\n\n\nIn the meantime, Laigle was engaged in reflection; he said half aloud:—\n\n“A B C, that is to say: the burial of Lamarque.”\n\n\n“The tall blonde,” remarked Grantaire, “is Enjolras, who is sending you\na warning.”\n\n\n“Shall we go?” ejaculated Bossuet.\n\n“It’s raiding,” said Joly. “I have sworn to go through fire, but not\nthrough water. I don’t wand to ged a gold.”\n\n\n“I shall stay here,” said Grantaire. “I prefer a breakfast to a\nhearse.”\n\n\n“Conclusion: we remain,” said Laigle. “Well, then, let us drink.\nBesides, we might miss the funeral without missing the riot.”\n\n\n“Ah! the riot, I am with you!” cried Joly.\n\nLaigle rubbed his hands.\n\n“Now we’re going to touch up the revolution of 1830. As a matter of\nfact, it does hurt the people along the seams.”\n\n\n“I don’t think much of your revolution,” said Grantaire. “I don’t\nexecrate this Government. It is the crown tempered by the cotton\nnight-cap. It is a sceptre ending in an umbrella. In fact, I think that\nto-day, with the present weather, Louis Philippe might utilize his\nroyalty in two directions, he might extend the tip of the sceptre end\nagainst the people, and open the umbrella end against heaven.”\n\n\nThe room was dark, large clouds had just finished the extinction of\ndaylight. There was no one in the wine-shop, or in the street, every\none having gone off “to watch events.”\n\n\n“Is it midday or midnight?” cried Bossuet. “You can’t see your hand\nbefore your face. Gibelotte, fetch a light.”\n\n\nGrantaire was drinking in a melancholy way.\n\n“Enjolras disdains me,” he muttered. “Enjolras said: ‘Joly is ill,\nGrantaire is drunk.’ It was to Bossuet that he sent Navet. If he had\ncome for me, I would have followed him. So much the worse for Enjolras!\nI won’t go to his funeral.”\n\n\nThis resolution once arrived at, Bossuet, Joly, and Grantaire did not\nstir from the wine-shop. By two o’clock in the afternoon, the table at\nwhich they sat was covered with empty bottles. Two candles were burning\non it, one in a flat copper candlestick which was perfectly green, the\nother in the neck of a cracked carafe. Grantaire had seduced Joly and\nBossuet to wine; Bossuet and Joly had conducted Grantaire back towards\ncheerfulness.\n\nAs for Grantaire, he had got beyond wine, that merely moderate inspirer\nof dreams, ever since midday. Wine enjoys only a conventional\npopularity with serious drinkers. There is, in fact, in the matter of\ninebriety, white magic and black magic; wine is only white magic.\nGrantaire was a daring drinker of dreams. The blackness of a terrible\nfit of drunkenness yawning before him, far from arresting him,\nattracted him. He had abandoned the bottle and taken to the beerglass.\nThe beer-glass is the abyss. Having neither opium nor hashish on hand,\nand being desirous of filling his brain with twilight, he had had\nrecourse to that fearful mixture of brandy, stout, absinthe, which\nproduces the most terrible of lethargies. It is of these three vapors,\nbeer, brandy, and absinthe, that the lead of the soul is composed. They\nare three grooms; the celestial butterfly is drowned in them; and there\nare formed there in a membranous smoke, vaguely condensed into the wing\nof the bat, three mute furies, Nightmare, Night, and Death, which hover\nabout the slumbering Psyche.\n\nGrantaire had not yet reached that lamentable phase; far from it. He\nwas tremendously gay, and Bossuet and Joly retorted. They clinked\nglasses. Grantaire added to the eccentric accentuation of words and\nideas, a peculiarity of gesture; he rested his left fist on his knee\nwith dignity, his arm forming a right angle, and, with cravat untied,\nseated astride a stool, his full glass in his right hand, he hurled\nsolemn words at the big maid-servant Matelote:—\n\n“Let the doors of the palace be thrown open! Let every one be a member\nof the French Academy and have the right to embrace Madame Hucheloup.\nLet us drink.”\n\n\nAnd turning to Madame Hucheloup, he added:—\n\n“Woman ancient and consecrated by use, draw near that I may contemplate\nthee!”\n\n\nAnd Joly exclaimed:—\n\n“Matelote and Gibelotte, dod’t gib Grantaire anything more to drink. He\nhas already devoured, since this bording, in wild prodigality, two\nfrancs and ninety-five centibes.”\n\n\nAnd Grantaire began again:—\n\n“Who has been unhooking the stars without my permission, and putting\nthem on the table in the guise of candles?”\n\n\nBossuet, though very drunk, preserved his equanimity.\n\nHe was seated on the sill of the open window, wetting his back in the\nfalling rain, and gazing at his two friends.\n\nAll at once, he heard a tumult behind him, hurried footsteps, cries of\n“To arms!” He turned round and saw in the Rue Saint-Denis, at the end\nof the Rue de la Chanvrerie, Enjolras passing, gun in hand, and\nGavroche with his pistol, Feuilly with his sword, Courfeyrac with his\nsword, and Jean Prouvaire with his blunderbuss, Combeferre with his\ngun, Bahorel with his gun, and the whole armed and stormy rabble which\nwas following them.\n\nThe Rue de la Chanvrerie was not more than a gunshot long. Bossuet\nimprovised a speaking-trumpet from his two hands placed around his\nmouth, and shouted:—\n\n“Courfeyrac! Courfeyrac! Hohée!”\n\n\nCourfeyrac heard the shout, caught sight of Bossuet, and advanced a few\npaces into the Rue de la Chanvrerie, shouting: “What do you want?”\nwhich crossed a “Where are you going?”\n\n\n“To make a barricade,” replied Courfeyrac.\n\n“Well, here! This is a good place! Make it here!”\n\n\n“That’s true, Aigle,” said Courfeyrac.\n\nAnd at a signal from Courfeyrac, the mob flung themselves into the Rue\nde la Chanvrerie.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—NIGHT BEGINS TO DESCEND UPON GRANTAIRE\n\n\nThe spot was, in fact, admirably adapted, the entrance to the street\nwidened out, the other extremity narrowed together into a pocket\nwithout exit. Corinthe created an obstacle, the Rue Mondétour was\neasily barricaded on the right and the left, no attack was possible\nexcept from the Rue Saint-Denis, that is to say, in front, and in full\nsight. Bossuet had the comprehensive glance of a fasting Hannibal.\n\nTerror had seized on the whole street at the irruption of the mob.\nThere was not a passer-by who did not get out of sight. In the space of\na flash of lightning, in the rear, to right and left, shops, stables,\narea-doors, windows, blinds, attic skylights, shutters of every\ndescription were closed, from the ground floor to the roof. A terrified\nold woman fixed a mattress in front of her window on two clothes-poles\nfor drying linen, in order to deaden the effect of musketry. The\nwine-shop alone remained open; and that for a very good reason, that\nthe mob had rushed into it.—“Ah my God! Ah my God!” sighed Mame\nHucheloup.\n\nBossuet had gone down to meet Courfeyrac.\n\nJoly, who had placed himself at the window, exclaimed:—\n\n“Courfeyrac, you ought to have brought an umbrella. You will gatch\ngold.”\n\n\nIn the meantime, in the space of a few minutes, twenty iron bars had\nbeen wrenched from the grated front of the wine-shop, ten fathoms of\nstreet had been unpaved; Gavroche and Bahorel had seized in its\npassage, and overturned, the dray of a lime-dealer named Anceau; this\ndray contained three barrels of lime, which they placed beneath the\npiles of paving-stones: Enjolras raised the cellar trap, and all the\nwidow Hucheloup’s empty casks were used to flank the barrels of lime;\nFeuilly, with his fingers skilled in painting the delicate sticks of\nfans, had backed up the barrels and the dray with two massive heaps of\nblocks of rough stone. Blocks which were improvised like the rest and\nprocured no one knows where. The beams which served as props were torn\nfrom the neighboring house-fronts and laid on the casks. When Bossuet\nand Courfeyrac turned round, half the street was already barred with a\nrampart higher than a man. There is nothing like the hand of the\npopulace for building everything that is built by demolishing.\n\nMatelote and Gibelotte had mingled with the workers. Gibelotte went and\ncame loaded with rubbish. Her lassitude helped on the barricade. She\nserved the barricade as she would have served wine, with a sleepy air.\n\nAn omnibus with two white horses passed the end of the street.\n\nBossuet strode over the paving-stones, ran to it, stopped the driver,\nmade the passengers alight, offered his hand to “the ladies,” dismissed\nthe conductor, and returned, leading the vehicle and the horses by the\nbridle.\n\n“Omnibuses,” said he, “do not pass the Corinthe. _Non licet omnibus\nadire Corinthum_.”\n\n\nAn instant later, the horses were unharnessed and went off at their\nwill, through the Rue Mondétour, and the omnibus lying on its side\ncompleted the bar across the street.\n\nMame Hucheloup, quite upset, had taken refuge in the first story.\n\nHer eyes were vague, and stared without seeing anything, and she cried\nin a low tone. Her terrified shrieks did not dare to emerge from her\nthroat.\n\n“The end of the world has come,” she muttered.\n\nJoly deposited a kiss on Mame Hucheloup’s fat, red, wrinkled neck, and\nsaid to Grantaire: “My dear fellow, I have always regarded a woman’s\nneck as an infinitely delicate thing.”\n\n\nBut Grantaire attained to the highest regions of dithryamb. Matelote\nhad mounted to the first floor once more, Grantaire seized her round\nher waist, and gave vent to long bursts of laughter at the window.\n\n“Matelote is homely!” he cried: “Matelote is of a dream of ugliness!\nMatelote is a chimæra. This is the secret of her birth: a Gothic\nPygmalion, who was making gargoyles for cathedrals, fell in love with\none of them, the most horrible, one fine morning. He besought Love to\ngive it life, and this produced Matelote. Look at her, citizens! She\nhas chromate-of-lead-colored hair, like Titian’s mistress, and she is a\ngood girl. I guarantee that she will fight well. Every good girl\ncontains a hero. As for Mother Hucheloup, she’s an old warrior. Look at\nher moustaches! She inherited them from her husband. A hussar indeed!\nShe will fight too. These two alone will strike terror to the heart of\nthe banlieue. Comrades, we shall overthrow the government as true as\nthere are fifteen intermediary acids between margaric acid and formic\nacid; however, that is a matter of perfect indifference to me.\nGentlemen, my father always detested me because I could not understand\nmathematics. I understand only love and liberty. I am Grantaire, the\ngood fellow. Having never had any money, I never acquired the habit of\nit, and the result is that I have never lacked it; but, if I had been\nrich, there would have been no more poor people! You would have seen!\nOh, if the kind hearts only had fat purses, how much better things\nwould go! I picture myself Jesus Christ with Rothschild’s fortune! How\nmuch good he would do! Matelote, embrace me! You are voluptuous and\ntimid! You have cheeks which invite the kiss of a sister, and lips\nwhich claim the kiss of a lover.”\n\n\n“Hold your tongue, you cask!” said Courfeyrac.\n\nGrantaire retorted:—\n\n“I am the capitoul52 and the master of the floral games!”\n\n\nEnjolras, who was standing on the crest of the barricade, gun in hand,\nraised his beautiful, austere face. Enjolras, as the reader knows, had\nsomething of the Spartan and of the Puritan in his composition. He\nwould have perished at Thermopylæ with Leonidas, and burned at Drogheda\nwith Cromwell.\n\n“Grantaire,” he shouted, “go get rid of the fumes of your wine\nsomewhere else than here. This is the place for enthusiasm, not for\ndrunkenness. Don’t disgrace the barricade!”\n\n\nThis angry speech produced a singular effect on Grantaire. One would\nhave said that he had had a glass of cold water flung in his face. He\nseemed to be rendered suddenly sober.\n\nHe sat down, put his elbows on a table near the window, looked at\nEnjolras with indescribable gentleness, and said to him:—\n\n“Let me sleep here.”\n\n\n“Go and sleep somewhere else,” cried Enjolras.\n\nBut Grantaire, still keeping his tender and troubled eyes fixed on him,\nreplied:—\n\n“Let me sleep here,—until I die.”\n\n\nEnjolras regarded him with disdainful eyes:—\n\n“Grantaire, you are incapable of believing, of thinking, of willing, of\nliving, and of dying.”\n\n\nGrantaire replied in a grave tone:—\n\n“You will see.”\n\n\nHe stammered a few more unintelligible words, then his head fell\nheavily on the table, and, as is the usual effect of the second period\nof inebriety, into which Enjolras had roughly and abruptly thrust him,\nan instant later he had fallen asleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—AN ATTEMPT TO CONSOLE THE WIDOW HUCHELOUP\n\n\nBahorel, in ecstasies over the barricade, shouted:—\n\n“Here’s the street in its low-necked dress! How well it looks!”\n\n\nCourfeyrac, as he demolished the wine-shop to some extent, sought to\nconsole the widowed proprietress.\n\n“Mother Hucheloup, weren’t you complaining the other day because you\nhad had a notice served on you for infringing the law, because\nGibelotte shook a counterpane out of your window?”\n\n\n“Yes, my good Monsieur Courfeyrac. Ah! good Heavens, are you going to\nput that table of mine in your horror, too? And it was for the\ncounterpane, and also for a pot of flowers which fell from the attic\nwindow into the street, that the government collected a fine of a\nhundred francs. If that isn’t an abomination, what is!”\n\n\n“Well, Mother Hucheloup, we are avenging you.”\n\n\nMother Hucheloup did not appear to understand very clearly the benefit\nwhich she was to derive from these reprisals made on her account. She\nwas satisfied after the manner of that Arab woman, who, having received\na box on the ear from her husband, went to complain to her father, and\ncried for vengeance, saying: “Father, you owe my husband affront for\naffront.” The father asked: “On which cheek did you receive the blow?”\n“On the left cheek.” The father slapped her right cheek and said: “Now\nyou are satisfied. Go tell your husband that he boxed my daughter’s\nears, and that I have accordingly boxed his wife’s.”\n\n\nThe rain had ceased. Recruits had arrived. Workmen had brought under\ntheir blouses a barrel of powder, a basket containing bottles of\nvitriol, two or three carnival torches, and a basket filled with\nfire-pots, “left over from the King’s festival.” This festival was very\nrecent, having taken place on the 1st of May. It was said that these\nmunitions came from a grocer in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine named Pépin.\nThey smashed the only street lantern in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the\nlantern corresponding to one in the Rue Saint-Denis, and all the\nlanterns in the surrounding streets, de Mondétour, du Cygne, des\nPrêcheurs, and de la Grande and de la Petite-Truanderie.\n\nEnjolras, Combeferre, and Courfeyrac directed everything. Two\nbarricades were now in process of construction at once, both of them\nresting on the Corinthe house and forming a right angle; the larger\nshut off the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the other closed the Rue Mondétour,\non the side of the Rue de Cygne. This last barricade, which was very\nnarrow, was constructed only of casks and paving-stones. There were\nabout fifty workers on it; thirty were armed with guns; for, on their\nway, they had effected a wholesale loan from an armorer’s shop.\n\nNothing could be more bizarre and at the same time more motley than\nthis troop. One had a round-jacket, a cavalry sabre, and two\nholster-pistols, another was in his shirt-sleeves, with a round hat,\nand a powder-horn slung at his side, a third wore a plastron of nine\nsheets of gray paper and was armed with a saddler’s awl. There was one\nwho was shouting: “Let us exterminate them to the last man and die at\nthe point of our bayonet.” This man had no bayonet. Another spread out\nover his coat the cross-belt and cartridge-box of a National Guardsman,\nthe cover of the cartridge-box being ornamented with this inscription\nin red worsted: _Public Order_. There were a great many guns bearing\nthe numbers of the legions, few hats, no cravats, many bare arms, some\npikes. Add to this, all ages, all sorts of faces, small, pale young\nmen, and bronzed longshoremen. All were in haste; and as they helped\neach other, they discussed the possible chances. That they would\nreceive succor about three o’clock in the morning—that they were sure\nof one regiment, that Paris would rise. Terrible sayings with which was\nmingled a sort of cordial joviality. One would have pronounced them\nbrothers, but they did not know each other’s names. Great perils have\nthis fine characteristic, that they bring to light the fraternity of\nstrangers. A fire had been lighted in the kitchen, and there they were\nengaged in moulding into bullets, pewter mugs, spoons, forks, and all\nthe brass table-ware of the establishment. In the midst of it all, they\ndrank. Caps and buckshot were mixed pell-mell on the tables with\nglasses of wine. In the billiard-hall, Mame Hucheloup, Matelote, and\nGibelotte, variously modified by terror, which had stupefied one,\nrendered another breathless, and roused the third, were tearing up old\ndish-cloths and making lint; three insurgents were assisting them,\nthree bushy-haired, jolly blades with beards and moustaches, who\nplucked away at the linen with the fingers of seamstresses and who made\nthem tremble.\n\nThe man of lofty stature whom Courfeyrac, Combeferre, and Enjolras had\nobserved at the moment when he joined the mob at the corner of the Rue\ndes Billettes, was at work on the smaller barricade and was making\nhimself useful there. Gavroche was working on the larger one. As for\nthe young man who had been waiting for Courfeyrac at his lodgings, and\nwho had inquired for M. Marius, he had disappeared at about the time\nwhen the omnibus had been overturned.\n\nGavroche, completely carried away and radiant, had undertaken to get\neverything in readiness. He went, came, mounted, descended, re-mounted,\nwhistled, and sparkled. He seemed to be there for the encouragement of\nall. Had he any incentive? Yes, certainly, his poverty; had he wings?\nyes, certainly, his joy. Gavroche was a whirlwind. He was constantly\nvisible, he was incessantly audible. He filled the air, as he was\neverywhere at once. He was a sort of almost irritating ubiquity; no\nhalt was possible with him. The enormous barricade felt him on its\nhaunches. He troubled the loungers, he excited the idle, he reanimated\nthe weary, he grew impatient over the thoughtful, he inspired gayety in\nsome, and breath in others, wrath in others, movement in all, now\npricking a student, now biting an artisan; he alighted, paused, flew\noff again, hovered over the tumult, and the effort, sprang from one\nparty to another, murmuring and humming, and harassed the whole\ncompany; a fly on the immense revolutionary coach.\n\nPerpetual motion was in his little arms and perpetual clamor in his\nlittle lungs.\n\n“Courage! more paving-stones! more casks! more machines! Where are you\nnow? A hod of plaster for me to stop this hole with! Your barricade is\nvery small. It must be carried up. Put everything on it, fling\neverything there, stick it all in. Break down the house. A barricade is\nMother Gibou’s tea. Hullo, here’s a glass door.”\n\n\nThis elicited an exclamation from the workers.\n\n“A glass door? what do you expect us to do with a glass door,\ntubercle?”\n\n\n“Hercules yourselves!” retorted Gavroche. “A glass door is an excellent\nthing in a barricade. It does not prevent an attack, but it prevents\nthe enemy taking it. So you’ve never prigged apples over a wall where\nthere were broken bottles? A glass door cuts the corns of the National\nGuard when they try to mount on the barricade. Pardi! glass is a\ntreacherous thing. Well, you haven’t a very wildly lively imagination,\ncomrades.”\n\n\nHowever, he was furious over his triggerless pistol. He went from one\nto another, demanding: “A gun, I want a gun! Why don’t you give me a\ngun?”\n\n\n“Give you a gun!” said Combeferre.\n\n“Come now!” said Gavroche, “why not? I had one in 1830 when we had a\ndispute with Charles X.”\n\n\nEnjolras shrugged his shoulders.\n\n“When there are enough for the men, we will give some to the children.”\n\n\nGavroche wheeled round haughtily, and answered:—\n\n“If you are killed before me, I shall take yours.”\n\n\n“Gamin!” said Enjolras.\n\n“Greenhorn!” said Gavroche.\n\nA dandy who had lost his way and who lounged past the end of the street\ncreated a diversion! Gavroche shouted to him:—\n\n“Come with us, young fellow! well now, don’t we do anything for this\nold country of ours?”\n\n\nThe dandy fled.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—PREPARATIONS\n\n\nThe journals of the day which said that that _nearly impregnable\nstructure_, of the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, as they call\nit, reached to the level of the first floor, were mistaken. The fact\nis, that it did not exceed an average height of six or seven feet. It\nwas built in such a manner that the combatants could, at their will,\neither disappear behind it or dominate the barrier and even scale its\ncrest by means of a quadruple row of paving-stones placed on top of\neach other and arranged as steps in the interior. On the outside, the\nfront of the barricade, composed of piles of paving-stones and casks\nbound together by beams and planks, which were entangled in the wheels\nof Anceau’s dray and of the overturned omnibus, had a bristling and\ninextricable aspect.\n\nAn aperture large enough to allow a man to pass through had been made\nbetween the wall of the houses and the extremity of the barricade which\nwas furthest from the wine-shop, so that an exit was possible at this\npoint. The pole of the omnibus was placed upright and held up with\nropes, and a red flag, fastened to this pole, floated over the\nbarricade.\n\nThe little Mondétour barricade, hidden behind the wine-shop building,\nwas not visible. The two barricades united formed a veritable redoubt.\nEnjolras and Courfeyrac had not thought fit to barricade the other\nfragment of the Rue Mondétour which opens through the Rue des Prêcheurs\nan issue into the Halles, wishing, no doubt, to preserve a possible\ncommunication with the outside, and not entertaining much fear of an\nattack through the dangerous and difficult street of the Rue des\nPrêcheurs.\n\nWith the exception of this issue which was left free, and which\nconstituted what Folard in his strategical style would have termed a\nbranch and taking into account, also, the narrow cutting arranged on\nthe Rue de la Chanvrerie, the interior of the barricade, where the\nwine-shop formed a salient angle, presented an irregular square, closed\non all sides. There existed an interval of twenty paces between the\ngrand barrier and the lofty houses which formed the background of the\nstreet, so that one might say that the barricade rested on these\nhouses, all inhabited, but closed from top to bottom.\n\nAll this work was performed without any hindrance, in less than an\nhour, and without this handful of bold men seeing a single bear-skin\ncap or a single bayonet make their appearance. The very bourgeois who\nstill ventured at this hour of riot to enter the Rue Saint-Denis cast a\nglance at the Rue de la Chanvrerie, caught sight of the barricade, and\nredoubled their pace.\n\nThe two barricades being finished, and the flag run up, a table was\ndragged out of the wine-shop; and Courfeyrac mounted on the table.\nEnjolras brought the square coffer, and Courfeyrac opened it. This\ncoffer was filled with cartridges. When the mob saw the cartridges, a\ntremor ran through the bravest, and a momentary silence ensued.\n\nCourfeyrac distributed them with a smile.\n\nEach one received thirty cartridges. Many had powder, and set about\nmaking others with the bullets which they had run. As for the barrel of\npowder, it stood on a table on one side, near the door, and was held in\nreserve.\n\nThe alarm beat which ran through all Paris, did not cease, but it had\nfinally come to be nothing more than a monotonous noise to which they\nno longer paid any attention. This noise retreated at times, and again\ndrew near, with melancholy undulations.\n\nThey loaded the guns and carbines, all together, without haste, with\nsolemn gravity. Enjolras went and stationed three sentinels outside the\nbarricades, one in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the second in the Rue des\nPrêcheurs, the third at the corner of the Rue de la Petite Truanderie.\n\nThen, the barricades having been built, the posts assigned, the guns\nloaded, the sentinels stationed, they waited, alone in those\nredoubtable streets through which no one passed any longer, surrounded\nby those dumb houses which seemed dead and in which no human movement\npalpitated, enveloped in the deepening shades of twilight which was\ndrawing on, in the midst of that silence through which something could\nbe felt advancing, and which had about it something tragic and\nterrifying, isolated, armed, determined, and tranquil.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—WAITING\n\n\nDuring those hours of waiting, what did they do?\n\nWe must needs tell, since this is a matter of history.\n\nWhile the men made bullets and the women lint, while a large saucepan\nof melted brass and lead, destined to the bullet-mould smoked over a\nglowing brazier, while the sentinels watched, weapon in hand, on the\nbarricade, while Enjolras, whom it was impossible to divert, kept an\neye on the sentinels, Combeferre, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly,\nBossuet, Joly, Bahorel, and some others, sought each other out and\nunited as in the most peaceful days of their conversations in their\nstudent life, and, in one corner of this wine-shop which had been\nconverted into a casement, a couple of paces distant from the redoubt\nwhich they had built, with their carbines loaded and primed resting\nagainst the backs of their chairs, these fine young fellows, so close\nto a supreme hour, began to recite love verses.\n\nWhat verses? These:—\n\nVous rappelez-vous notre douce vie,\nLorsque nous étions si jeunes tous deux,\nEt que nous n’avions au cœur d’autre envie\nQue d‘être bien mis et d‘être amoureux,\n\nLorsqu’en ajoutant votre âge à mon âge,\nNous ne comptions pas à deux quarante ans,\nEt que, dans notre humble et petit ménage,\nTout, même l’hiver, nous était printemps?\n\nBeaux jours! Manuel était fier et sage,\nParis s’asseyait à de saints banquets,\nFoy lançait la foudre, et votre corsage\nAvait une épingle où je me piquais.\n\nTout vous contemplait. Avocat sans causes,\nQuand je vous menais au Prado dîner,\nVous étiez jolie au point que les roses\nMe faisaient l’effet de se retourner.\n\nJe les entendais dire: Est elle belle!\nComme elle sent bon!  Quels cheveux à flots!\nSous son mantelet elle cache une aile,\nSon bonnet charmant est à peine éclos.\n\nJ’errais avec toi, pressant ton bras souple.\nLes passants croyaient que l’amour charmé\nAvait marié, dans notre heureux couple,\nLe doux mois d’avril au beau mois de mai.\n\nNous vivions cachés, contents, porte close,\nDévorant l’amour, bon fruit défendu,\nMa bouche n’avait pas dit une chose\nQue déjà ton cœur avait répondu.\n\nLa Sorbonne était l’endroit bucolique\nOù je t’adorais du soir au matin.\nC’est ainsi qu’une âme amoureuse applique\nLa carte du Tendre au pays Latin.\n\nO place Maubert! O place Dauphine!\nQuand, dans le taudis frais et printanier,\nTu tirais ton bas sur ta jambe fine,\nJe voyais un astre au fond du grenier.\n\nJ’ai fort lu Platon, mais rien ne m’en reste;\nMieux que Malebranche et que Lamennais,\nTu me démontrais la bonté céleste\nAvec une fleur que tu me donnais.\n\nJe t’obéissais, tu m‘étais soumise;\nO grenier doré! te lacer! te voir\nAller et venir dès l’aube en chemise,\nMirant ton jeune front à ton vieux miroir.\n\nEt qui donc pourrait perdre la mémoire\nDe ces temps d’aurore et de firmament,\nDe rubans, de fleurs, de gaze et de moire,\nOù l’amour bégaye un argot charmant?\n\nNos jardins étaient un pot de tulipe;\nTu masquais la vitre avec un jupon;\nJe prenais le bol de terre de pipe,\nEt je te donnais le tasse en japon.\n\nEt ces grands malheurs qui nous faisaient rire!\nTon manchon brûlé, ton boa perdu!\nEt ce cher portrait du divin Shakespeare\nQu’un soir pour souper nons avons vendu!\n\nJ‘étais mendiant et toi charitable.\nJe baisais au vol tes bras frais et ronds.\nDante in folio nous servait de table\nPour manger gaîment un cent de marrons.\n\nLa première fois qu’en mon joyeux bouge\nJe pris un baiser à ta lèvre en feu,\nQuand tu t’en allais décoiffée et rouge,\nJe restai tout pâle et je crus en Dieu!\n\nTe rappelles-tu nos bonheurs sans nombre,\nEt tous ces fichus changés en chiffons?\nOh que de soupirs, de nos cœurs pleins d’ombre,\nSe sont envolés dans les cieux profonds!53\n\n\nThe hour, the spot, these souvenirs of youth recalled, a few stars\nwhich began to twinkle in the sky, the funeral repose of those deserted\nstreets, the imminence of the inexorable adventure, which was in\npreparation, gave a pathetic charm to these verses murmured in a low\ntone in the dusk by Jean Prouvaire, who, as we have said, was a gentle\npoet.\n\nIn the meantime, a lamp had been lighted in the small barricade, and in\nthe large one, one of those wax torches such as are to be met with on\nShrove-Tuesday in front of vehicles loaded with masks, on their way to\nla Courtille. These torches, as the reader has seen, came from the\nFaubourg Saint-Antoine.\n\nThe torch had been placed in a sort of cage of paving-stones closed on\nthree sides to shelter it from the wind, and disposed in such a fashion\nthat all the light fell on the flag. The street and the barricade\nremained sunk in gloom, and nothing was to be seen except the red flag\nformidably illuminated as by an enormous dark-lantern.\n\nThis light enhanced the scarlet of the flag, with an indescribable and\nterrible purple.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—THE MAN RECRUITED IN THE RUE DES BILLETTES\n\n\nNight was fully come, nothing made its appearance. All that they heard\nwas confused noises, and at intervals, fusillades; but these were rare,\nbadly sustained and distant. This respite, which was thus prolonged,\nwas a sign that the Government was taking its time, and collecting its\nforces. These fifty men were waiting for sixty thousand.\n\nEnjolras felt attacked by that impatience which seizes on strong souls\non the threshold of redoubtable events. He went in search of Gavroche,\nwho had set to making cartridges in the tap-room, by the dubious light\nof two candles placed on the counter by way of precaution, on account\nof the powder which was scattered on the tables. These two candles cast\nno gleam outside. The insurgents had, moreover, taken pains not to have\nany light in the upper stories.\n\nGavroche was deeply preoccupied at that moment, but not precisely with\nhis cartridges. The man of the Rue des Billettes had just entered the\ntap-room and had seated himself at the table which was the least\nlighted. A musket of large model had fallen to his share, and he held\nit between his legs. Gavroche, who had been, up to that moment,\ndistracted by a hundred “amusing” things, had not even seen this man.\n\nWhen he entered, Gavroche followed him mechanically with his eyes,\nadmiring his gun; then, all at once, when the man was seated, the\nstreet urchin sprang to his feet. Any one who had spied upon that man\nup to that moment, would have seen that he was observing everything in\nthe barricade and in the band of insurgents, with singular attention;\nbut, from the moment when he had entered this room, he had fallen into\na sort of brown study, and no longer seemed to see anything that was\ngoing on. The gamin approached this pensive personage, and began to\nstep around him on tiptoe, as one walks in the vicinity of a person\nwhom one is afraid of waking. At the same time, over his childish\ncountenance which was, at once so impudent and so serious, so giddy and\nso profound, so gay and so heart-breaking, passed all those grimaces of\nan old man which signify: Ah bah! impossible! My sight is bad! I am\ndreaming! can this be? no, it is not! but yes! why, no! etc. Gavroche\nbalanced on his heels, clenched both fists in his pockets, moved his\nneck around like a bird, expended in a gigantic pout all the sagacity\nof his lower lip. He was astounded, uncertain, incredulous, convinced,\ndazzled. He had the mien of the chief of the eunuchs in the slave mart,\ndiscovering a Venus among the blowsy females, and the air of an amateur\nrecognizing a Raphael in a heap of daubs. His whole being was at work,\nthe instinct which scents out, and the intelligence which combines. It\nwas evident that a great event had happened in Gavroche’s life.\n\nIt was at the most intense point of this preoccupation that Enjolras\naccosted him.\n\n“You are small,” said Enjolras, “you will not be seen. Go out of the\nbarricade, slip along close to the houses, skirmish about a bit in the\nstreets, and come back and tell me what is going on.”\n\n\nGavroche raised himself on his haunches.\n\n“So the little chaps are good for something! that’s very lucky! I’ll\ngo! In the meanwhile, trust to the little fellows, and distrust the big\nones.” And Gavroche, raising his head and lowering his voice, added, as\nhe indicated the man of the Rue des Billettes: “Do you see that big\nfellow there?”\n\n\n“Well?”\n\n\n“He’s a police spy.”\n\n\n“Are you sure of it?”\n\n\n“It isn’t two weeks since he pulled me off the cornice of the Port\nRoyal, where I was taking the air, by my ear.”\n\n\nEnjolras hastily quitted the urchin and murmured a few words in a very\nlow tone to a longshoreman from the winedocks who chanced to be at\nhand. The man left the room, and returned almost immediately,\naccompanied by three others. The four men, four porters with broad\nshoulders, went and placed themselves without doing anything to attract\nhis attention, behind the table on which the man of the Rue des\nBillettes was leaning with his elbows. They were evidently ready to\nhurl themselves upon him.\n\nThen Enjolras approached the man and demanded of him:—\n\n“Who are you?”\n\n\nAt this abrupt query, the man started. He plunged his gaze deep into\nEnjolras’ clear eyes and appeared to grasp the latter’s meaning. He\nsmiled with a smile than which nothing more disdainful, more energetic,\nand more resolute could be seen in the world, and replied with haughty\ngravity:—\n\n“I see what it is. Well, yes!”\n\n\n“You are a police spy?”\n\n\n“I am an agent of the authorities.”\n\n\n“And your name?”\n\n\n“Javert.”\n\n\nEnjolras made a sign to the four men. In the twinkling of an eye,\nbefore Javert had time to turn round, he was collared, thrown down,\npinioned and searched.\n\nThey found on him a little round card pasted between two pieces of\nglass, and bearing on one side the arms of France, engraved, and with\nthis motto: _Supervision and vigilance_, and on the other this note:\n“JAVERT, inspector of police, aged fifty-two,” and the signature of the\nPrefect of Police of that day, M. Gisquet.\n\nBesides this, he had his watch and his purse, which contained several\ngold pieces. They left him his purse and his watch. Under the watch, at\nthe bottom of his fob, they felt and seized a paper in an envelope,\nwhich Enjolras unfolded, and on which he read these five lines, written\nin the very hand of the Prefect of Police:—\n\n“As soon as his political mission is accomplished, Inspector Javert\nwill make sure, by special supervision, whether it is true that the\nmalefactors have instituted intrigues on the right bank of the Seine,\nnear the Jena bridge.”\n\n\nThe search ended, they lifted Javert to his feet, bound his arms behind\nhis back, and fastened him to that celebrated post in the middle of the\nroom which had formerly given the wine-shop its name.\n\nGavroche, who had looked on at the whole of this scene and had approved\nof everything with a silent toss of his head, stepped up to Javert and\nsaid to him:—\n\n“It’s the mouse who has caught the cat.”\n\n\nAll this was so rapidly executed, that it was all over when those about\nthe wine-shop noticed it.\n\nJavert had not uttered a single cry.\n\nAt the sight of Javert bound to the post, Courfeyrac, Bossuet, Joly,\nCombeferre, and the men scattered over the two barricades came running\nup.\n\nJavert, with his back to the post, and so surrounded with ropes that he\ncould not make a movement, raised his head with the intrepid serenity\nof the man who has never lied.\n\n“He is a police spy,” said Enjolras.\n\nAnd turning to Javert: “You will be shot ten minutes before the\nbarricade is taken.”\n\n\nJavert replied in his most imperious tone:—\n\n“Why not at once?”\n\n\n“We are saving our powder.”\n\n\n“Then finish the business with a blow from a knife.”\n\n\n“Spy,” said the handsome Enjolras, “we are judges and not assassins.”\n\n\nThen he called Gavroche:—\n\n“Here you! go about your business! Do what I told you!”\n\n\n“I’m going!” cried Gavroche.\n\nAnd halting as he was on the point of setting out:—\n\n“By the way, you will give me his gun!” and he added: “I leave you the\nmusician, but I want the clarinet.”\n\n\nThe gamin made the military salute and passed gayly through the opening\nin the large barricade.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—MANY INTERROGATION POINTS WITH REGARD TO A CERTAIN LE\nCABUC WHOSE NAME MAY NOT HAVE BEEN LE CABUC\n\n\nThe tragic picture which we have undertaken would not be complete, the\nreader would not see those grand moments of social birth-pangs in a\nrevolutionary birth, which contain convulsion mingled with effort, in\ntheir exact and real relief, were we to omit, in the sketch here\noutlined, an incident full of epic and savage horror which occurred\nalmost immediately after Gavroche’s departure.\n\nMobs, as the reader knows, are like a snowball, and collect as they\nroll along, a throng of tumultuous men. These men do not ask each other\nwhence they come. Among the passers-by who had joined the rabble led by\nEnjolras, Combeferre, and Courfeyrac, there had been a person wearing\nthe jacket of a street porter, which was very threadbare on the\nshoulders, who gesticulated and vociferated, and who had the look of a\ndrunken savage. This man, whose name or nickname was Le Cabuc, and who\nwas, moreover, an utter stranger to those who pretended to know him,\nwas very drunk, or assumed the appearance of being so, and had seated\nhimself with several others at a table which they had dragged outside\nof the wine-shop. This Cabuc, while making those who vied with him\ndrunk seemed to be examining with a thoughtful air the large house at\nthe extremity of the barricade, whose five stories commanded the whole\nstreet and faced the Rue Saint-Denis. All at once he exclaimed:—\n\n“Do you know, comrades, it is from that house yonder that we must fire.\nWhen we are at the windows, the deuce is in it if any one can advance\ninto the street!”\n\n\n“Yes, but the house is closed,” said one of the drinkers.\n\n“Let us knock!”\n\n\n“They will not open.”\n\n\n“Let us break in the door!”\n\n\nLe Cabuc runs to the door, which had a very massive knocker, and\nknocks. The door opens not. He strikes a second blow. No one answers. A\nthird stroke. The same silence.\n\n“Is there any one here?” shouts Cabuc.\n\nNothing stirs.\n\nThen he seizes a gun and begins to batter the door with the butt end.\n\nIt was an ancient alley door, low, vaulted, narrow, solid, entirely of\noak, lined on the inside with a sheet of iron and iron stays, a genuine\nprison postern. The blows from the butt end of the gun made the house\ntremble, but did not shake the door.\n\nNevertheless, it is probable that the inhabitants were disturbed, for a\ntiny, square window was finally seen to open on the third story, and at\nthis aperture appeared the reverend and terrified face of a gray-haired\nold man, who was the porter, and who held a candle.\n\nThe man who was knocking paused.\n\n“Gentlemen,” said the porter, “what do you want?”\n\n\n“Open!” said Cabuc.\n\n“That cannot be, gentlemen.”\n\n\n“Open, nevertheless.”\n\n\n“Impossible, gentlemen.”\n\n\nLe Cabuc took his gun and aimed at the porter; but as he was below, and\nas it was very dark, the porter did not see him.\n\n“Will you open, yes or no?”\n\n\n“No, gentlemen.”\n\n\n“Do you say no?”\n\n\n“I say no, my goo—”\n\n\nThe porter did not finish. The shot was fired; the ball entered under\nhis chin and came out at the nape of his neck, after traversing the\njugular vein.\n\nThe old man fell back without a sigh. The candle fell and was\nextinguished, and nothing more was to be seen except a motionless head\nlying on the sill of the small window, and a little whitish smoke which\nfloated off towards the roof.\n\n“There!” said Le Cabuc, dropping the butt end of his gun to the\npavement.\n\nHe had hardly uttered this word, when he felt a hand laid on his\nshoulder with the weight of an eagle’s talon, and he heard a voice\nsaying to him:—\n\n“On your knees.”\n\n\nThe murderer turned round and saw before him Enjolras’ cold, white\nface.\n\nEnjolras held a pistol in his hand.\n\nHe had hastened up at the sound of the discharge.\n\nHe had seized Cabuc’s collar, blouse, shirt, and suspender with his\nleft hand.\n\n“On your knees!” he repeated.\n\nAnd, with an imperious motion, the frail young man of twenty years bent\nthe thickset and sturdy porter like a reed, and brought him to his\nknees in the mire.\n\nLe Cabuc attempted to resist, but he seemed to have been seized by a\nsuperhuman hand.\n\nEnjolras, pale, with bare neck and dishevelled hair, and his woman’s\nface, had about him at that moment something of the antique Themis. His\ndilated nostrils, his downcast eyes, gave to his implacable Greek\nprofile that expression of wrath and that expression of Chastity which,\nas the ancient world viewed the matter, befit Justice.\n\nThe whole barricade hastened up, then all ranged themselves in a circle\nat a distance, feeling that it was impossible to utter a word in the\npresence of the thing which they were about to behold.\n\nLe Cabuc, vanquished, no longer tried to struggle, and trembled in\nevery limb.\n\nEnjolras released him and drew out his watch.\n\n“Collect yourself,” said he. “Think or pray. You have one minute.”\n\n\n“Mercy!” murmured the murderer; then he dropped his head and stammered\na few inarticulate oaths.\n\nEnjolras never took his eyes off of him: he allowed a minute to pass,\nthen he replaced his watch in his fob. That done, he grasped Le Cabuc\nby the hair, as the latter coiled himself into a ball at his knees and\nshrieked, and placed the muzzle of the pistol to his ear. Many of those\nintrepid men, who had so tranquilly entered upon the most terrible of\nadventures, turned aside their heads.\n\nAn explosion was heard, the assassin fell to the pavement face\ndownwards.\n\nEnjolras straightened himself up, and cast a convinced and severe\nglance around him. Then he spurned the corpse with his foot and said:—\n\n“Throw that outside.”\n\n\nThree men raised the body of the unhappy wretch, which was still\nagitated by the last mechanical convulsions of the life that had fled,\nand flung it over the little barricade into the Rue Mondétour.\n\nEnjolras was thoughtful. It is impossible to say what grandiose shadows\nslowly spread over his redoubtable serenity. All at once he raised his\nvoice.\n\nA silence fell upon them.\n\n“Citizens,” said Enjolras, “what that man did is frightful, what I have\ndone is horrible. He killed, therefore I killed him. I had to do it,\nbecause insurrection must have its discipline. Assassination is even\nmore of a crime here than elsewhere; we are under the eyes of the\nRevolution, we are the priests of the Republic, we are the victims of\nduty, and must not be possible to slander our combat. I have,\ntherefore, tried that man, and condemned him to death. As for myself,\nconstrained as I am to do what I have done, and yet abhorring it, I\nhave judged myself also, and you shall soon see to what I have\ncondemned myself.”\n\n\nThose who listened to him shuddered.\n\n“We will share thy fate,” cried Combeferre.\n\n“So be it,” replied Enjolras. “One word more. In executing this man, I\nhave obeyed necessity; but necessity is a monster of the old world,\nnecessity’s name is Fatality. Now, the law of progress is, that\nmonsters shall disappear before the angels, and that Fatality shall\nvanish before Fraternity. It is a bad moment to pronounce the word\nlove. No matter, I do pronounce it. And I glorify it. Love, the future\nis thine. Death, I make use of thee, but I hate thee. Citizens, in the\nfuture there will be neither darkness nor thunderbolts; neither\nferocious ignorance, nor bloody retaliation. As there will be no more\nSatan, there will be no more Michael. In the future no one will kill\nany one else, the earth will beam with radiance, the human race will\nlove. The day will come, citizens, when all will be concord, harmony,\nlight, joy and life; it will come, and it is in order that it may come\nthat we are about to die.”\n\n\nEnjolras ceased. His virgin lips closed; and he remained for some time\nstanding on the spot where he had shed blood, in marble immobility. His\nstaring eye caused those about him to speak in low tones.\n\nJean Prouvaire and Combeferre pressed each other’s hands silently, and,\nleaning against each other in an angle of the barricade, they watched\nwith an admiration in which there was some compassion, that grave young\nman, executioner and priest, composed of light, like crystal, and also\nof rock.\n\nLet us say at once that later on, after the action, when the bodies\nwere taken to the morgue and searched, a police agent’s card was found\non Le Cabuc. The author of this book had in his hands, in 1848, the\nspecial report on this subject made to the Prefect of Police in 1832.\n\nWe will add, that if we are to believe a tradition of the police, which\nis strange but probably well founded, Le Cabuc was Claquesous. The fact\nis, that dating from the death of Le Cabuc, there was no longer any\nquestion of Claquesous. Claquesous had nowhere left any trace of his\ndisappearance; he would seem to have amalgamated himself with the\ninvisible. His life had been all shadows, his end was night.\n\nThe whole insurgent group was still under the influence of the emotion\nof that tragic case which had been so quickly tried and so quickly\nterminated, when Courfeyrac again beheld on the barricade, the small\nyoung man who had inquired of him that morning for Marius.\n\nThis lad, who had a bold and reckless air, had come by night to join\nthe insurgents.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THIRTEENTH—MARIUS ENTERS THE SHADOW\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—FROM THE RUE PLUMET TO THE QUARTIER SAINT-DENIS\n\n\nThe voice which had summoned Marius through the twilight to the\nbarricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, had produced on him the effect\nof the voice of destiny. He wished to die; the opportunity presented\nitself; he knocked at the door of the tomb, a hand in the darkness\noffered him the key. These melancholy openings which take place in the\ngloom before despair, are tempting. Marius thrust aside the bar which\nhad so often allowed him to pass, emerged from the garden, and said: “I\nwill go.”\n\n\nMad with grief, no longer conscious of anything fixed or solid in his\nbrain, incapable of accepting anything thenceforth of fate after those\ntwo months passed in the intoxication of youth and love, overwhelmed at\nonce by all the reveries of despair, he had but one desire remaining,\nto make a speedy end of all.\n\nHe set out at rapid pace. He found himself most opportunely armed, as\nhe had Javert’s pistols with him.\n\nThe young man of whom he thought that he had caught a glimpse, had\nvanished from his sight in the street.\n\nMarius, who had emerged from the Rue Plumet by the boulevard, traversed\nthe Esplanade and the bridge of the Invalides, the Champs-Élysées, the\nPlace Louis XV., and reached the Rue de Rivoli. The shops were open\nthere, the gas was burning under the arcades, women were making their\npurchases in the stalls, people were eating ices in the Café Laiter,\nand nibbling small cakes at the English pastry-cook’s shop. Only a few\nposting-chaises were setting out at a gallop from the Hôtel des Princes\nand the Hôtel Meurice.\n\nMarius entered the Rue Saint-Honoré through the Passage Delorme. There\nthe shops were closed, the merchants were chatting in front of their\nhalf-open doors, people were walking about, the street lanterns were\nlighted, beginning with the first floor, all the windows were lighted\nas usual. There was cavalry on the Place du Palais-Royal.\n\nMarius followed the Rue Saint-Honoré. In proportion as he left the\nPalais-Royal behind him, there were fewer lighted windows, the shops\nwere fast shut, no one was chatting on the thresholds, the street grew\nsombre, and, at the same time, the crowd increased in density. For the\npassers-by now amounted to a crowd. No one could be seen to speak in\nthis throng, and yet there arose from it a dull, deep murmur.\n\nNear the fountain of the Arbre-Sec, there were “assemblages”,\nmotionless and gloomy groups which were to those who went and came as\nstones in the midst of running water.\n\nAt the entrance to the Rue des Prouvaires, the crowd no longer walked.\nIt formed a resisting, massive, solid, compact, almost impenetrable\nblock of people who were huddled together, and conversing in low tones.\nThere were hardly any black coats or round hats now, but smock frocks,\nblouses, caps, and bristling and cadaverous heads. This multitude\nundulated confusedly in the nocturnal gloom. Its whisperings had the\nhoarse accent of a vibration. Although not one of them was walking, a\ndull trampling was audible in the mire. Beyond this dense portion of\nthe throng, in the Rue du Roule, in the Rue des Prouvaires, and in the\nextension of the Rue Saint-Honoré, there was no longer a single window\nin which a candle was burning. Only the solitary and diminishing rows\nof lanterns could be seen vanishing into the street in the distance.\nThe lanterns of that date resembled large red stars, hanging to ropes,\nand shed upon the pavement a shadow which had the form of a huge\nspider. These streets were not deserted. There could be descried piles\nof guns, moving bayonets, and troops bivouacking. No curious observer\npassed that limit. There circulation ceased. There the rabble ended and\nthe army began.\n\nMarius willed with the will of a man who hopes no more. He had been\nsummoned, he must go. He found a means to traverse the throng and to\npass the bivouac of the troops, he shunned the patrols, he avoided the\nsentinels. He made a circuit, reached the Rue de Béthisy, and directed\nhis course towards the Halles. At the corner of the Rue des\nBourdonnais, there were no longer any lanterns.\n\nAfter having passed the zone of the crowd, he had passed the limits of\nthe troops; he found himself in something startling. There was no\nlonger a passer-by, no longer a soldier, no longer a light, there was\nno one; solitude, silence, night, I know not what chill which seized\nhold upon one. Entering a street was like entering a cellar.\n\nHe continued to advance.\n\nHe took a few steps. Some one passed close to him at a run. Was it a\nman? Or a woman? Were there many of them? he could not have told. It\nhad passed and vanished.\n\nProceeding from circuit to circuit, he reached a lane which he judged\nto be the Rue de la Poterie; near the middle of this street, he came in\ncontact with an obstacle. He extended his hands. It was an overturned\nwagon; his foot recognized pools of water, gullies, and paving-stones\nscattered and piled up. A barricade had been begun there and abandoned.\nHe climbed over the stones and found himself on the other side of the\nbarrier. He walked very near the street-posts, and guided himself along\nthe walls of the houses. A little beyond the barricade, it seemed to\nhim that he could make out something white in front of him. He\napproached, it took on a form. It was two white horses; the horses of\nthe omnibus harnessed by Bossuet in the morning, who had been straying\nat random all day from street to street, and had finally halted there,\nwith the weary patience of brutes who no more understand the actions of\nmen, than man understands the actions of Providence.\n\nMarius left the horses behind him. As he was approaching a street which\nseemed to him to be the Rue du Contrat-Social, a shot coming no one\nknows whence, and traversing the darkness at random, whistled close by\nhim, and the bullet pierced a brass shaving-dish suspended above his\nhead over a hairdresser’s shop. This pierced shaving-dish was still to\nbe seen in 1848, in the Rue du Contrat-Social, at the corner of the\npillars of the market.\n\nThis shot still betokened life. From that instant forth he encountered\nnothing more.\n\nThe whole of this itinerary resembled a descent of black steps.\n\nNevertheless, Marius pressed forward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—AN OWL’S VIEW OF PARIS\n\n\nA being who could have hovered over Paris that night with the wing of\nthe bat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle.\n\nAll that old quarter of the Halles, which is like a city within a city,\nthrough which run the Rues Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, where a\nthousand lanes cross, and of which the insurgents had made their\nredoubt and their stronghold, would have appeared to him like a dark\nand enormous cavity hollowed out in the centre of Paris. There the\nglance fell into an abyss. Thanks to the broken lanterns, thanks to the\nclosed windows, there all radiance, all life, all sound, all movement\nceased. The invisible police of the insurrection were on the watch\neverywhere, and maintained order, that is to say, night. The necessary\ntactics of insurrection are to drown small numbers in a vast obscurity,\nto multiply every combatant by the possibilities which that obscurity\ncontains. At dusk, every window where a candle was burning received a\nshot. The light was extinguished, sometimes the inhabitant was killed.\nHence nothing was stirring. There was nothing but fright, mourning,\nstupor in the houses; and in the streets, a sort of sacred horror. Not\neven the long rows of windows and stores, the indentations of the\nchimneys, and the roofs, and the vague reflections which are cast back\nby the wet and muddy pavements, were visible. An eye cast upward at\nthat mass of shadows might, perhaps, have caught a glimpse here and\nthere, at intervals, of indistinct gleams which brought out broken and\neccentric lines, and profiles of singular buildings, something like the\nlights which go and come in ruins; it was at such points that the\nbarricades were situated. The rest was a lake of obscurity, foggy,\nheavy, and funereal, above which, in motionless and melancholy\noutlines, rose the tower of Saint-Jacques, the church of Saint-Merry,\nand two or three more of those grand edifices of which man makes giants\nand the night makes phantoms.\n\nAll around this deserted and disquieting labyrinth, in the quarters\nwhere the Parisian circulation had not been annihilated, and where a\nfew street lanterns still burned, the aerial observer might have\ndistinguished the metallic gleam of swords and bayonets, the dull\nrumble of artillery, and the swarming of silent battalions whose ranks\nwere swelling from minute to minute; a formidable girdle which was\nslowly drawing in and around the insurrection.\n\nThe invested quarter was no longer anything more than a monstrous\ncavern; everything there appeared to be asleep or motionless, and, as\nwe have just seen, any street which one might come to offered nothing\nbut darkness.\n\nA wild darkness, full of traps, full of unseen and formidable shocks,\ninto which it was alarming to penetrate, and in which it was terrible\nto remain, where those who entered shivered before those whom they\nawaited, where those who waited shuddered before those who were coming.\nInvisible combatants were entrenched at every corner of the street;\nsnares of the sepulchre concealed in the density of night. All was\nover. No more light was to be hoped for, henceforth, except the\nlightning of guns, no further encounter except the abrupt and rapid\napparition of death. Where? How? When? No one knew, but it was certain\nand inevitable. In this place which had been marked out for the\nstruggle, the Government and the insurrection, the National Guard, and\npopular societies, the bourgeois and the uprising, groping their way,\nwere about to come into contact. The necessity was the same for both.\nThe only possible issue thenceforth was to emerge thence killed or\nconquerors. A situation so extreme, an obscurity so powerful, that the\nmost timid felt themselves seized with resolution, and the most daring\nwith terror.\n\nMoreover, on both sides, the fury, the rage, and the determination were\nequal. For the one party, to advance meant death, and no one dreamed of\nretreating; for the other, to remain meant death, and no one dreamed of\nflight.\n\nIt was indispensable that all should be ended on the following day,\nthat triumph should rest either here or there, that the insurrection\nshould prove itself a revolution or a skirmish. The Government\nunderstood this as well as the parties; the most insignificant\nbourgeois felt it. Hence a thought of anguish which mingled with the\nimpenetrable gloom of this quarter where all was at the point of being\ndecided; hence a redoubled anxiety around that silence whence a\ncatastrophe was on the point of emerging. Here only one sound was\naudible, a sound as heart-rending as the death rattle, as menacing as a\nmalediction, the tocsin of Saint-Merry. Nothing could be more\nblood-curdling than the clamor of that wild and desperate bell, wailing\namid the shadows.\n\nAs it often happens, nature seemed to have fallen into accord with what\nmen were about to do. Nothing disturbed the harmony of the whole\neffect. The stars had disappeared, heavy clouds filled the horizon with\ntheir melancholy folds. A black sky rested on these dead streets, as\nthough an immense winding-sheet were being outspread over this immense\ntomb.\n\nWhile a battle that was still wholly political was in preparation in\nthe same locality which had already witnessed so many revolutionary\nevents, while youth, the secret associations, the schools, in the name\nof principles, and the middle classes, in the name of interests, were\napproaching preparatory to dashing themselves together, clasping and\nthrowing each other, while each one hastened and invited the last and\ndecisive hour of the crisis, far away and quite outside of this fatal\nquarter, in the most profound depths of the unfathomable cavities of\nthat wretched old Paris which disappears under the splendor of happy\nand opulent Paris, the sombre voice of the people could be heard giving\nutterance to a dull roar.\n\nA fearful and sacred voice which is composed of the roar of the brute\nand of the word of God, which terrifies the weak and which warns the\nwise, which comes both from below like the voice of the lion, and from\non high like the voice of the thunder.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—THE EXTREME EDGE\n\n\nMarius had reached the Halles.\n\nThere everything was still calmer, more obscure and more motionless\nthan in the neighboring streets. One would have said that the glacial\npeace of the sepulchre had sprung forth from the earth and had spread\nover the heavens.\n\nNevertheless, a red glow brought out against this black background the\nlofty roofs of the houses which barred the Rue de la Chanvrerie on the\nSaint-Eustache side. It was the reflection of the torch which was\nburning in the Corinthe barricade. Marius directed his steps towards\nthat red light. It had drawn him to the Marché-aux-Poirées, and he\ncaught a glimpse of the dark mouth of the Rue des Prêcheurs. He entered\nit. The insurgents’ sentinel, who was guarding the other end, did not\nsee him. He felt that he was very close to that which he had come in\nsearch of, and he walked on tiptoe. In this manner he reached the elbow\nof that short section of the Rue Mondétour which was, as the reader\nwill remember, the only communication which Enjolras had preserved with\nthe outside world. At the corner of the last house, on his left, he\nthrust his head forward, and looked into the fragment of the Rue\nMondétour.\n\nA little beyond the angle of the lane and the Rue de la Chanvrerie\nwhich cast a broad curtain of shadow, in which he was himself engulfed,\nhe perceived some light on the pavement, a bit of the wine-shop, and\nbeyond, a flickering lamp within a sort of shapeless wall, and men\ncrouching down with guns on their knees. All this was ten fathoms\ndistant from him. It was the interior of the barricade.\n\nThe houses which bordered the lane on the right concealed the rest of\nthe wine-shop, the large barricade, and the flag from him.\n\nMarius had but a step more to take.\n\nThen the unhappy young man seated himself on a post, folded his arms,\nand fell to thinking about his father.\n\nHe thought of that heroic Colonel Pontmercy, who had been so proud a\nsoldier, who had guarded the frontier of France under the Republic, and\nhad touched the frontier of Asia under Napoleon, who had beheld Genoa,\nAlexandria, Milan, Turin, Madrid, Vienna, Dresden, Berlin, Moscow, who\nhad left on all the victorious battle-fields of Europe drops of that\nsame blood, which he, Marius, had in his veins, who had grown gray\nbefore his time in discipline and command, who had lived with his\nsword-belt buckled, his epaulets falling on his breast, his cockade\nblackened with powder, his brow furrowed with his helmet, in barracks,\nin camp, in the bivouac, in ambulances, and who, at the expiration of\ntwenty years, had returned from the great wars with a scarred cheek, a\nsmiling countenance, tranquil, admirable, pure as a child, having done\neverything for France and nothing against her.\n\nHe said to himself that his day had also come now, that his hour had\nstruck, that following his father, he too was about to show himself\nbrave, intrepid, bold, to run to meet the bullets, to offer his breast\nto bayonets, to shed his blood, to seek the enemy, to seek death, that\nhe was about to wage war in his turn and descend to the field of\nbattle, and that the field of battle upon which he was to descend was\nthe street, and that the war in which he was about to engage was civil\nwar!\n\nHe beheld civil war laid open like a gulf before him, and into this he\nwas about to fall. Then he shuddered.\n\nHe thought of his father’s sword, which his grandfather had sold to a\nsecond-hand dealer, and which he had so mournfully regretted. He said\nto himself that that chaste and valiant sword had done well to escape\nfrom him, and to depart in wrath into the gloom; that if it had thus\nfled, it was because it was intelligent and because it had foreseen the\nfuture; that it had had a presentiment of this rebellion, the war of\nthe gutters, the war of the pavements, fusillades through\ncellar-windows, blows given and received in the rear; it was because,\ncoming from Marengo and Friedland, it did not wish to go to the Rue de\nla Chanvrerie; it was because, after what it had done with the father,\nit did not wish to do this for the son! He told himself that if that\nsword were there, if after taking possession of it at his father’s\npillow, he had dared to take it and carry it off for this combat of\ndarkness between Frenchmen in the streets, it would assuredly have\nscorched his hands and burst out aflame before his eyes, like the sword\nof the angel! He told himself that it was fortunate that it was not\nthere and that it had disappeared, that that was well, that that was\njust, that his grandfather had been the true guardian of his father’s\nglory, and that it was far better that the colonel’s sword should be\nsold at auction, sold to the old-clothes man, thrown among the old\njunk, than that it should, to-day, wound the side of his country.\n\nAnd then he fell to weeping bitterly.\n\nThis was horrible. But what was he to do? Live without Cosette he could\nnot. Since she was gone, he must needs die. Had he not given her his\nword of honor that he would die? She had gone knowing that; this meant\nthat it pleased her that Marius should die. And then, it was clear that\nshe no longer loved him, since she had departed thus without warning,\nwithout a word, without a letter, although she knew his address! What\nwas the good of living, and why should he live now? And then, what!\nshould he retreat after going so far? should he flee from danger after\nhaving approached it? should he slip away after having come and peeped\ninto the barricade? slip away, all in a tremble, saying: “After all, I\nhave had enough of it as it is. I have seen it, that suffices, this is\ncivil war, and I shall take my leave!” Should he abandon his friends\nwho were expecting him? Who were in need of him possibly! who were a\nmere handful against an army! Should he be untrue at once to his love,\nto country, to his word? Should he give to his cowardice the pretext of\npatriotism? But this was impossible, and if the phantom of his father\nwas there in the gloom, and beheld him retreating, he would beat him on\nthe loins with the flat of his sword, and shout to him: “March on, you\npoltroon!”\n\n\nThus a prey to the conflicting movements of his thoughts, he dropped\nhis head.\n\nAll at once he raised it. A sort of splendid rectification had just\nbeen effected in his mind. There is a widening of the sphere of thought\nwhich is peculiar to the vicinity of the grave; it makes one see\nclearly to be near death. The vision of the action into which he felt\nthat he was, perhaps, on the point of entering, appeared to him no more\nas lamentable, but as superb. The war of the street was suddenly\ntransfigured by some unfathomable inward working of his soul, before\nthe eye of his thought. All the tumultuous interrogation points of\nreverie recurred to him in throngs, but without troubling him. He left\nnone of them unanswered.\n\nLet us see, why should his father be indignant? Are there not cases\nwhere insurrection rises to the dignity of duty? What was there that\nwas degrading for the son of Colonel Pontmercy in the combat which was\nabout to begin? It is no longer Montmirail nor Champaubert; it is\nsomething quite different. The question is no longer one of sacred\nterritory,—but of a holy idea. The country wails, that may be, but\nhumanity applauds. But is it true that the country does wail? France\nbleeds, but liberty smiles; and in the presence of liberty’s smile,\nFrance forgets her wound. And then if we look at things from a still\nmore lofty point of view, why do we speak of civil war?\n\nCivil war—what does that mean? Is there a foreign war? Is not all war\nbetween men, war between brothers? War is qualified only by its object.\nThere is no such thing as foreign or civil war; there is only just and\nunjust war. Until that day when the grand human agreement is concluded,\nwar, that at least which is the effort of the future, which is\nhastening on against the past, which is lagging in the rear, may be\nnecessary. What have we to reproach that war with? War does not become\na disgrace, the sword does not become a disgrace, except when it is\nused for assassinating the right, progress, reason, civilization,\ntruth. Then war, whether foreign or civil, is iniquitous; it is called\ncrime. Outside the pale of that holy thing, justice, by what right does\none form of man despise another? By what right should the sword of\nWashington disown the pike of Camille Desmoulins? Leonidas against the\nstranger, Timoleon against the tyrant, which is the greater? the one is\nthe defender, the other the liberator. Shall we brand every appeal to\narms within a city’s limits without taking the object into a\nconsideration? Then note the infamy of Brutus, Marcel, Arnould von\nBlankenheim, Coligny, Hedgerow war? War of the streets? Why not? That\nwas the war of Ambiorix, of Artevelde, of Marnix, of Pelagius. But\nAmbiorix fought against Rome, Artevelde against France, Marnix against\nSpain, Pelagius against the Moors; all against the foreigner. Well, the\nmonarchy is a foreigner; oppression is a stranger; the right divine is\na stranger. Despotism violates the moral frontier, an invasion violates\nthe geographical frontier. Driving out the tyrant or driving out the\nEnglish, in both cases, regaining possession of one’s own territory.\nThere comes an hour when protestation no longer suffices; after\nphilosophy, action is required; live force finishes what the idea has\nsketched out; Prometheus chained begins, Arostogeiton ends; the\nencyclopedia enlightens souls, the 10th of August electrifies them.\nAfter Æschylus, Thrasybulus; after Diderot, Danton. Multitudes have a\ntendency to accept the master. Their mass bears witness to apathy. A\ncrowd is easily led as a whole to obedience. Men must be stirred up,\npushed on, treated roughly by the very benefit of their deliverance,\ntheir eyes must be wounded by the true, light must be hurled at them in\nterrible handfuls. They must be a little thunderstruck themselves at\ntheir own well-being; this dazzling awakens them. Hence the necessity\nof tocsins and wars. Great combatants must rise, must enlighten nations\nwith audacity, and shake up that sad humanity which is covered with\ngloom by the right divine, Cæsarian glory, force, fanaticism,\nirresponsible power, and absolute majesty; a rabble stupidly occupied\nin the contemplation, in their twilight splendor, of these sombre\ntriumphs of the night. Down with the tyrant! Of whom are you speaking?\nDo you call Louis Philippe the tyrant? No; no more than Louis XVI. Both\nof them are what history is in the habit of calling good kings; but\nprinciples are not to be parcelled out, the logic of the true is\nrectilinear, the peculiarity of truth is that it lacks complaisance; no\nconcessions, then; all encroachments on man should be repressed. There\nis a divine right in Louis XVI., there is _because a Bourbon_ in Louis\nPhilippe; both represent in a certain measure the confiscation of\nright, and, in order to clear away universal insurrection, they must be\ncombated; it must be done, France being always the one to begin. When\nthe master falls in France, he falls everywhere. In short, what cause\nis more just, and consequently, what war is greater, than that which\nre-establishes social truth, restores her throne to liberty, restores\nthe people to the people, restores sovereignty to man, replaces the\npurple on the head of France, restores equity and reason in their\nplenitude, suppresses every germ of antagonism by restoring each one to\nhimself, annihilates the obstacle which royalty presents to the whole\nimmense universal concord, and places the human race once more on a\nlevel with the right? These wars build up peace. An enormous fortress\nof prejudices, privileges, superstitions, lies, exactions, abuses,\nviolences, iniquities, and darkness still stands erect in this world,\nwith its towers of hatred. It must be cast down. This monstrous mass\nmust be made to crumble. To conquer at Austerlitz is grand; to take the\nBastille is immense.\n\nThere is no one who has not noticed it in his own case—the soul,—and\ntherein lies the marvel of its unity complicated with ubiquity, has a\nstrange aptitude for reasoning almost coldly in the most violent\nextremities, and it often happens that heartbroken passion and profound\ndespair in the very agony of their blackest monologues, treat subjects\nand discuss theses. Logic is mingled with convulsion, and the thread of\nthe syllogism floats, without breaking, in the mournful storm of\nthought. This was the situation of Marius’ mind.\n\nAs he meditated thus, dejected but resolute, hesitating in every\ndirection, and, in short, shuddering at what he was about to do, his\nglance strayed to the interior of the barricade. The insurgents were\nhere conversing in a low voice, without moving, and there was\nperceptible that quasi-silence which marks the last stage of\nexpectation. Overhead, at the small window in the third story Marius\ndescried a sort of spectator who appeared to him to be singularly\nattentive. This was the porter who had been killed by Le Cabuc. Below,\nby the lights of the torch, which was thrust between the paving-stones,\nthis head could be vaguely distinguished. Nothing could be stranger, in\nthat sombre and uncertain gleam, than that livid, motionless,\nastonished face, with its bristling hair, its eyes fixed and staring,\nand its yawning mouth, bent over the street in an attitude of\ncuriosity. One would have said that the man who was dead was surveying\nthose who were about to die. A long trail of blood which had flowed\nfrom that head, descended in reddish threads from the window to the\nheight of the first floor, where it stopped.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTEENTH—THE GRANDEURS OF DESPAIR\n\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nThe Grandeurs of Despair 4b-14-1-despair\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE FLAG: ACT FIRST\n\n\nAs yet, nothing had come. Ten o’clock had sounded from Saint-Merry.\nEnjolras and Combeferre had gone and seated themselves, carbines in\nhand, near the outlet of the grand barricade. They no longer addressed\neach other, they listened, seeking to catch even the faintest and most\ndistant sound of marching.\n\nSuddenly, in the midst of the dismal calm, a clear, gay, young voice,\nwhich seemed to come from the Rue Saint-Denis, rose and began to sing\ndistinctly, to the old popular air of “By the Light of the Moon,” this\nbit of poetry, terminated by a cry like the crow of a cock:—\n\nMon nez est en larmes,\nMon ami Bugeaud,\nPrête moi tes gendarmes\nPour leur dire un mot.\n\nEn capote bleue,\nLa poule au shako,\nVoici la banlieue!\nCo-cocorico!54\n\n\nThey pressed each other’s hands.\n\n“That is Gavroche,” said Enjolras.\n\n“He is warning us,” said Combeferre.\n\nA hasty rush troubled the deserted street; they beheld a being more\nagile than a clown climb over the omnibus, and Gavroche bounded into\nthe barricade, all breathless, saying:—\n\n“My gun! Here they are!”\n\n\nAn electric quiver shot through the whole barricade, and the sound of\nhands seeking their guns became audible.\n\n“Would you like my carbine?” said Enjolras to the lad.\n\n“I want a big gun,” replied Gavroche.\n\nAnd he seized Javert’s gun.\n\nTwo sentinels had fallen back, and had come in almost at the same\nmoment as Gavroche. They were the sentinels from the end of the street,\nand the vidette of the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie. The vidette of the\nLane des Prêcheurs had remained at his post, which indicated that\nnothing was approaching from the direction of the bridges and Halles.\n\nThe Rue de la Chanvrerie, of which a few paving-stones alone were dimly\nvisible in the reflection of the light projected on the flag, offered\nto the insurgents the aspect of a vast black door vaguely opened into a\nsmoke.\n\nEach man had taken up his position for the conflict.\n\nForty-three insurgents, among whom were Enjolras, Combeferre,\nCourfeyrac, Bossuet, Joly, Bahorel, and Gavroche, were kneeling inside\nthe large barricade, with their heads on a level with the crest of the\nbarrier, the barrels of their guns and carbines aimed on the stones as\nthough at loop-holes, attentive, mute, ready to fire. Six, commanded by\nFeuilly, had installed themselves, with their guns levelled at their\nshoulders, at the windows of the two stories of Corinthe.\n\nSeveral minutes passed thus, then a sound of footsteps, measured,\nheavy, and numerous, became distinctly audible in the direction of\nSaint-Leu. This sound, faint at first, then precise, then heavy and\nsonorous, approached slowly, without halt, without intermission, with a\ntranquil and terrible continuity. Nothing was to be heard but this. It\nwas that combined silence and sound, of the statue of the commander,\nbut this stony step had something indescribably enormous and multiple\nabout it which awakened the idea of a throng, and, at the same time,\nthe idea of a spectre. One thought one heard the terrible statue Legion\nmarching onward. This tread drew near; it drew still nearer, and\nstopped. It seemed as though the breathing of many men could be heard\nat the end of the street. Nothing was to be seen, however, but at the\nbottom of that dense obscurity there could be distinguished a multitude\nof metallic threads, as fine as needles and almost imperceptible, which\nmoved about like those indescribable phosphoric networks which one sees\nbeneath one’s closed eyelids, in the first mists of slumber at the\nmoment when one is dropping off to sleep. These were bayonets and\ngun-barrels confusedly illuminated by the distant reflection of the\ntorch.\n\nA pause ensued, as though both sides were waiting. All at once, from\nthe depths of this darkness, a voice, which was all the more sinister,\nsince no one was visible, and which appeared to be the gloom itself\nspeaking, shouted:—\n\n“Who goes there?”\n\n\nAt the same time, the click of guns, as they were lowered into\nposition, was heard.\n\nEnjolras replied in a haughty and vibrating tone:—\n\n“The French Revolution!”\n\n\n“Fire!” shouted the voice.\n\nA flash empurpled all the façades in the street as though the door of a\nfurnace had been flung open, and hastily closed again.\n\nA fearful detonation burst forth on the barricade. The red flag fell.\nThe discharge had been so violent and so dense that it had cut the\nstaff, that is to say, the very tip of the omnibus pole.\n\nBullets which had rebounded from the cornices of the houses penetrated\nthe barricade and wounded several men.\n\nThe impression produced by this first discharge was freezing. The\nattack had been rough, and of a nature to inspire reflection in the\nboldest. It was evident that they had to deal with an entire regiment\nat the very least.\n\n“Comrades!” shouted Courfeyrac, “let us not waste our powder. Let us\nwait until they are in the street before replying.”\n\n\n“And, above all,” said Enjolras, “let us raise the flag again.”\n\n\nHe picked up the flag, which had fallen precisely at his feet.\n\nOutside, the clatter of the ramrods in the guns could be heard; the\ntroops were re-loading their arms.\n\nEnjolras went on:—\n\n“Who is there here with a bold heart? Who will plant the flag on the\nbarricade again?”\n\n\nNot a man responded. To mount on the barricade at the very moment when,\nwithout any doubt, it was again the object of their aim, was simply\ndeath. The bravest hesitated to pronounce his own condemnation.\nEnjolras himself felt a thrill. He repeated:—\n\n“Does no one volunteer?”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—THE FLAG: ACT SECOND\n\n\nSince they had arrived at Corinthe, and had begun the construction of\nthe barricade, no attention had been paid to Father Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf\nhad not quitted the mob, however; he had entered the ground floor of\nthe wine-shop and had seated himself behind the counter. There he had,\nso to speak, retreated into himself. He no longer seemed to look or to\nthink. Courfeyrac and others had accosted him two or three times,\nwarning him of his peril, beseeching him to withdraw, but he did not\nhear them. When they were not speaking to him, his mouth moved as\nthough he were replying to some one, and as soon as he was addressed,\nhis lips became motionless and his eyes no longer had the appearance of\nbeing alive.\n\nSeveral hours before the barricade was attacked, he had assumed an\nattitude which he did not afterwards abandon, with both fists planted\non his knees and his head thrust forward as though he were gazing over\na precipice. Nothing had been able to move him from this attitude; it\ndid not seem as though his mind were in the barricade. When each had\ngone to take up his position for the combat, there remained in the\ntap-room where Javert was bound to the post, only a single insurgent\nwith a naked sword, watching over Javert, and himself, Mabeuf. At the\nmoment of the attack, at the detonation, the physical shock had reached\nhim and had, as it were, awakened him; he started up abruptly, crossed\nthe room, and at the instant when Enjolras repeated his appeal: “Does\nno one volunteer?” the old man was seen to make his appearance on the\nthreshold of the wine-shop. His presence produced a sort of commotion\nin the different groups. A shout went up:—\n\n“It is the voter! It is the member of the Convention! It is the\nrepresentative of the people!”\n\n\nIt is probable that he did not hear them.\n\nHe strode straight up to Enjolras, the insurgents withdrawing before\nhim with a religious fear; he tore the flag from Enjolras, who recoiled\nin amazement and then, since no one dared to stop or to assist him,\nthis old man of eighty, with shaking head but firm foot, began slowly\nto ascend the staircase of paving-stones arranged in the barricade.\nThis was so melancholy and so grand that all around him cried: “Off\nwith your hats!” At every step that he mounted, it was a frightful\nspectacle; his white locks, his decrepit face, his lofty, bald, and\nwrinkled brow, his amazed and open mouth, his aged arm upholding the\nred banner, rose through the gloom and were enlarged in the bloody\nlight of the torch, and the bystanders thought that they beheld the\nspectre of ’93 emerging from the earth, with the flag of terror in his\nhand.\n\nWhen he had reached the last step, when this trembling and terrible\nphantom, erect on that pile of rubbish in the presence of twelve\nhundred invisible guns, drew himself up in the face of death and as\nthough he were more powerful than it, the whole barricade assumed amid\nthe darkness, a supernatural and colossal form.\n\nThere ensued one of those silences which occur only in the presence of\nprodigies. In the midst of this silence, the old man waved the red flag\nand shouted:—\n\n“Long live the Revolution! Long live the Republic! Fraternity!\nEquality! and Death!”\n\n\nThose in the barricade heard a low and rapid whisper, like the murmur\nof a priest who is despatching a prayer in haste. It was probably the\ncommissary of police who was making the legal summons at the other end\nof the street.\n\nThen the same piercing voice which had shouted: “Who goes there?”\nshouted:—\n\n“Retire!”\n\n\nM. Mabeuf, pale, haggard, his eyes lighted up with the mournful flame\nof aberration, raised the flag above his head and repeated:—\n\n“Long live the Republic!”\n\n\n“Fire!” said the voice.\n\nA second discharge, similar to the first, rained down upon the\nbarricade.\n\nThe old man fell on his knees, then rose again, dropped the flag and\nfell backwards on the pavement, like a log, at full length, with\noutstretched arms.\n\nRivulets of blood flowed beneath him. His aged head, pale and sad,\nseemed to be gazing at the sky.\n\nOne of those emotions which are superior to man, which make him forget\neven to defend himself, seized upon the insurgents, and they approached\nthe body with respectful awe.\n\n“What men these regicides were!” said Enjolras.\n\nCourfeyrac bent down to Enjolras’ ear:—\n\n“This is for yourself alone, I do not wish to dampen the enthusiasm.\nBut this man was anything rather than a regicide. I knew him. His name\nwas Father Mabeuf. I do not know what was the matter with him to-day.\nBut he was a brave blockhead. Just look at his head.”\n\n\n“The head of a blockhead and the heart of a Brutus,” replied Enjolras.\n\nThen he raised his voice:—\n\n“Citizens! This is the example which the old give to the young. We\nhesitated, he came! We were drawing back, he advanced! This is what\nthose who are trembling with age teach to those who tremble with fear!\nThis aged man is august in the eyes of his country. He has had a long\nlife and a magnificent death! Now, let us place the body under cover,\nthat each one of us may defend this old man dead as he would his father\nliving, and may his presence in our midst render the barricade\nimpregnable!”\n\n\nA murmur of gloomy and energetic assent followed these words.\n\nEnjolras bent down, raised the old man’s head, and fierce as he was, he\nkissed him on the brow, then, throwing wide his arms, and handling this\ndead man with tender precaution, as though he feared to hurt it, he\nremoved his coat, showed the bloody holes in it to all, and said:—\n\n“This is our flag now.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—GAVROCHE WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO ACCEPT ENJOLRAS’ CARBINE\n\n\nThey threw a long black shawl of Widow Hucheloup’s over Father Mabeuf.\nSix men made a litter of their guns; on this they laid the body, and\nbore it, with bared heads, with solemn slowness, to the large table in\nthe tap-room.\n\nThese men, wholly absorbed in the grave and sacred task in which they\nwere engaged, thought no more of the perilous situation in which they\nstood.\n\nWhen the corpse passed near Javert, who was still impassive, Enjolras\nsaid to the spy:—\n\n“It will be your turn presently!”\n\n\nDuring all this time, Little Gavroche, who alone had not quitted his\npost, but had remained on guard, thought he espied some men stealthily\napproaching the barricade. All at once he shouted:—\n\n“Look out!”\n\n\nCourfeyrac, Enjolras, Jean Prouvaire, Combeferre, Joly, Bahorel,\nBossuet, and all the rest ran tumultuously from the wine-shop. It was\nalmost too late. They saw a glistening density of bayonets undulating\nabove the barricade. Municipal guards of lofty stature were making\ntheir way in, some striding over the omnibus, others through the cut,\nthrusting before them the urchin, who retreated, but did not flee.\n\nThe moment was critical. It was that first, redoubtable moment of\ninundation, when the stream rises to the level of the levee and when\nthe water begins to filter through the fissures of dike. A second more\nand the barricade would have been taken.\n\nBahorel dashed upon the first municipal guard who was entering, and\nkilled him on the spot with a blow from his gun; the second killed\nBahorel with a blow from his bayonet. Another had already overthrown\nCourfeyrac, who was shouting: “Follow me!” The largest of all, a sort\nof colossus, marched on Gavroche with his bayonet fixed. The urchin\ntook in his arms Javert’s immense gun, levelled it resolutely at the\ngiant, and fired. No discharge followed. Javert’s gun was not loaded.\nThe municipal guard burst into a laugh and raised his bayonet at the\nchild.\n\nBefore the bayonet had touched Gavroche, the gun slipped from the\nsoldier’s grasp, a bullet had struck the municipal guardsman in the\ncentre of the forehead, and he fell over on his back. A second bullet\nstruck the other guard, who had assaulted Courfeyrac in the breast, and\nlaid him low on the pavement.\n\nThis was the work of Marius, who had just entered the barricade.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—THE BARREL OF POWDER\n\n\nMarius, still concealed in the turn of the Rue Mondétour, had\nwitnessed, shuddering and irresolute, the first phase of the combat.\nBut he had not long been able to resist that mysterious and sovereign\nvertigo which may be designated as the call of the abyss. In the\npresence of the imminence of the peril, in the presence of the death of\nM. Mabeuf, that melancholy enigma, in the presence of Bahorel killed,\nand Courfeyrac shouting: “Follow me!” of that child threatened, of his\nfriends to succor or to avenge, all hesitation had vanished, and he had\nflung himself into the conflict, his two pistols in hand. With his\nfirst shot he had saved Gavroche, and with the second delivered\nCourfeyrac.\n\nAmid the sound of the shots, amid the cries of the assaulted guards,\nthe assailants had climbed the entrenchment, on whose summit Municipal\nGuards, soldiers of the line and National Guards from the suburbs could\nnow be seen, gun in hand, rearing themselves to more than half the\nheight of their bodies.\n\nThey already covered more than two-thirds of the barrier, but they did\nnot leap into the enclosure, as though wavering in the fear of some\ntrap. They gazed into the dark barricade as one would gaze into a\nlion’s den. The light of the torch illuminated only their bayonets,\ntheir bear-skin caps, and the upper part of their uneasy and angry\nfaces.\n\nMarius had no longer any weapons; he had flung away his discharged\npistols after firing them; but he had caught sight of the barrel of\npowder in the tap-room, near the door.\n\nAs he turned half round, gazing in that direction, a soldier took aim\nat him. At the moment when the soldier was sighting Marius, a hand was\nlaid on the muzzle of the gun and obstructed it. This was done by some\none who had darted forward,—the young workman in velvet trousers. The\nshot sped, traversed the hand and possibly, also, the workman, since he\nfell, but the ball did not strike Marius. All this, which was rather to\nbe apprehended than seen through the smoke, Marius, who was entering\nthe tap-room, hardly noticed. Still, he had, in a confused way,\nperceived that gun-barrel aimed at him, and the hand which had blocked\nit, and he had heard the discharge. But in moments like this, the\nthings which one sees vacillate and are precipitated, and one pauses\nfor nothing. One feels obscurely impelled towards more darkness still,\nand all is cloud.\n\nThe insurgents, surprised but not terrified, had rallied. Enjolras had\nshouted: “Wait! Don’t fire at random!” In the first confusion, they\nmight, in fact, wound each other. The majority of them had ascended to\nthe window on the first story and to the attic windows, whence they\ncommanded the assailants.\n\nThe most determined, with Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, and\nCombeferre, had proudly placed themselves with their backs against the\nhouses at the rear, unsheltered and facing the ranks of soldiers and\nguards who crowned the barricade.\n\nAll this was accomplished without haste, with that strange and\nthreatening gravity which precedes engagements. They took aim, point\nblank, on both sides: they were so close that they could talk together\nwithout raising their voices.\n\nWhen they had reached this point where the spark is on the brink of\ndarting forth, an officer in a gorget extended his sword and said:—\n\n“Lay down your arms!”\n\n\n“Fire!” replied Enjolras.\n\nThe two discharges took place at the same moment, and all disappeared\nin smoke.\n\nAn acrid and stifling smoke in which dying and wounded lay with weak,\ndull groans. When the smoke cleared away, the combatants on both sides\ncould be seen to be thinned out, but still in the same positions,\nreloading in silence. All at once, a thundering voice was heard,\nshouting:—\n\n“Be off with you, or I’ll blow up the barricade!”\n\n\nAll turned in the direction whence the voice proceeded.\n\nMarius had entered the tap-room, and had seized the barrel of powder,\nthen he had taken advantage of the smoke, and the sort of obscure mist\nwhich filled the entrenched enclosure, to glide along the barricade as\nfar as that cage of paving-stones where the torch was fixed. To tear it\nfrom the torch, to replace it by the barrel of powder, to thrust the\npile of stones under the barrel, which was instantly staved in, with a\nsort of horrible obedience,—all this had cost Marius but the time\nnecessary to stoop and rise again; and now all, National Guards,\nMunicipal Guards, officers, soldiers, huddled at the other extremity of\nthe barricade, gazed stupidly at him, as he stood with his foot on the\nstones, his torch in his hand, his haughty face illuminated by a fatal\nresolution, drooping the flame of the torch towards that redoubtable\npile where they could make out the broken barrel of powder, and giving\nvent to that startling cry:—\n\n“Be off with you, or I’ll blow up the barricade!”\n\n\nMarius on that barricade after the octogenarian was the vision of the\nyoung revolution after the apparition of the old.\n\n“Blow up the barricade!” said a sergeant, “and yourself with it!”\n\n\nMarius retorted: “And myself also.”\n\n\nAnd he dropped the torch towards the barrel of powder.\n\nBut there was no longer any one on the barrier. The assailants,\nabandoning their dead and wounded, flowed back pell-mell and in\ndisorder towards the extremity of the street, and there were again lost\nin the night. It was a headlong flight.\n\nThe barricade was free.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—END OF THE VERSES OF JEAN PROUVAIRE\n\n\nAll flocked around Marius. Courfeyrac flung himself on his neck.\n\n“Here you are!”\n\n\n“What luck!” said Combeferre.\n\n“You came in opportunely!” ejaculated Bossuet.\n\n“If it had not been for you, I should have been dead!” began Courfeyrac\nagain.\n\n“If it had not been for you, I should have been gobbled up!” added\nGavroche.\n\nMarius asked:—\n\n“Where is the chief?”\n\n\n“You are he!” said Enjolras.\n\nMarius had had a furnace in his brain all day long; now it was a\nwhirlwind. This whirlwind which was within him, produced on him the\neffect of being outside of him and of bearing him away. It seemed to\nhim that he was already at an immense distance from life. His two\nluminous months of joy and love, ending abruptly at that frightful\nprecipice, Cosette lost to him, that barricade, M. Mabeuf getting\nhimself killed for the Republic, himself the leader of the\ninsurgents,—all these things appeared to him like a tremendous\nnightmare. He was obliged to make a mental effort to recall the fact\nthat all that surrounded him was real. Marius had already seen too much\nof life not to know that nothing is more imminent than the impossible,\nand that what it is always necessary to foresee is the unforeseen. He\nhad looked on at his own drama as a piece which one does not\nunderstand.\n\nIn the mists which enveloped his thoughts, he did not recognize Javert,\nwho, bound to his post, had not so much as moved his head during the\nwhole of the attack on the barricade, and who had gazed on the revolt\nseething around him with the resignation of a martyr and the majesty of\na judge. Marius had not even seen him.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the assailants did not stir, they could be heard\nmarching and swarming through at the end of the street but they did not\nventure into it, either because they were awaiting orders or because\nthey were awaiting reinforcements before hurling themselves afresh on\nthis impregnable redoubt. The insurgents had posted sentinels, and some\nof them, who were medical students, set about caring for the wounded.\n\nThey had thrown the tables out of the wine-shop, with the exception of\nthe two tables reserved for lint and cartridges, and of the one on\nwhich lay Father Mabeuf; they had added them to the barricade, and had\nreplaced them in the tap-room with mattresses from the bed of the widow\nHucheloup and her servants. On these mattresses they had laid the\nwounded. As for the three poor creatures who inhabited Corinthe, no one\nknew what had become of them. They were finally found, however, hidden\nin the cellar.\n\nA poignant emotion clouded the joy of the disencumbered barricade.\n\nThe roll was called. One of the insurgents was missing. And who was it?\nOne of the dearest. One of the most valiant. Jean Prouvaire. He was\nsought among the wounded, he was not there. He was sought among the\ndead, he was not there. He was evidently a prisoner. Combeferre said to\nEnjolras:—\n\n“They have our friend; we have their agent. Are you set on the death of\nthat spy?”\n\n\n“Yes,” replied Enjolras; “but less so than on the life of Jean\nProuvaire.”\n\n\nThis took place in the tap-room near Javert’s post.\n\n“Well,” resumed Combeferre, “I am going to fasten my handkerchief to my\ncane, and go as a flag of truce, to offer to exchange our man for\ntheirs.”\n\n\n“Listen,” said Enjolras, laying his hand on Combeferre’s arm.\n\nAt the end of the street there was a significant clash of arms.\n\nThey heard a manly voice shout:—\n\n“Vive la France! Long live France! Long live the future!”\n\n\nThey recognized the voice of Prouvaire.\n\nA flash passed, a report rang out.\n\nSilence fell again.\n\n“They have killed him,” exclaimed Combeferre.\n\nEnjolras glanced at Javert, and said to him:—\n\n“Your friends have just shot you.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—THE AGONY OF DEATH AFTER THE AGONY OF LIFE\n\n\nA peculiarity of this species of war is, that the attack of the\nbarricades is almost always made from the front, and that the\nassailants generally abstain from turning the position, either because\nthey fear ambushes, or because they are afraid of getting entangled in\nthe tortuous streets. The insurgents’ whole attention had been\ndirected, therefore, to the grand barricade, which was, evidently, the\nspot always menaced, and there the struggle would infallibly\nrecommence. But Marius thought of the little barricade, and went\nthither. It was deserted and guarded only by the fire-pot which\ntrembled between the paving-stones. Moreover, the Mondétour alley, and\nthe branches of the Rue de la Petite Truanderie and the Rue du Cygne\nwere profoundly calm.\n\nAs Marius was withdrawing, after concluding his inspection, he heard\nhis name pronounced feebly in the darkness.\n\n“Monsieur Marius!”\n\n\nHe started, for he recognized the voice which had called to him two\nhours before through the gate in the Rue Plumet.\n\nOnly, the voice now seemed to be nothing more than a breath.\n\nHe looked about him, but saw no one.\n\nMarius thought he had been mistaken, that it was an illusion added by\nhis mind to the extraordinary realities which were clashing around him.\nHe advanced a step, in order to quit the distant recess where the\nbarricade lay.\n\n“Monsieur Marius!” repeated the voice.\n\nThis time he could not doubt that he had heard it distinctly; he looked\nand saw nothing.\n\n“At your feet,” said the voice.\n\nHe bent down, and saw in the darkness a form which was dragging itself\ntowards him.\n\nIt was crawling along the pavement. It was this that had spoken to him.\n\nThe fire-pot allowed him to distinguish a blouse, torn trousers of\ncoarse velvet, bare feet, and something which resembled a pool of\nblood. Marius indistinctly made out a pale head which was lifted\ntowards him and which was saying to him:—\n\n“You do not recognize me?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“Éponine.”\n\n\nMarius bent hastily down. It was, in fact, that unhappy child. She was\ndressed in men’s clothes.\n\n“How come you here? What are you doing here?”\n\n\n“I am dying,” said she.\n\nThere are words and incidents which arouse dejected beings. Marius\ncried out with a start:—\n\n“You are wounded! Wait, I will carry you into the room! They will\nattend to you there. Is it serious? How must I take hold of you in\norder not to hurt you? Where do you suffer? Help! My God! But why did\nyou come hither?”\n\n\nAnd he tried to pass his arm under her, in order to raise her.\n\nShe uttered a feeble cry.\n\n“Have I hurt you?” asked Marius.\n\n“A little.”\n\n\n“But I only touched your hand.”\n\n\nShe raised her hand to Marius, and in the middle of that hand Marius\nsaw a black hole.\n\n“What is the matter with your hand?” said he.\n\n“It is pierced.”\n\n\n“Pierced?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“What with?”\n\n\n“A bullet.”\n\n\n“How?”\n\n\n“Did you see a gun aimed at you?”\n\n\n“Yes, and a hand stopping it.”\n\n\n“It was mine.”\n\n\nMarius was seized with a shudder.\n\n“What madness! Poor child! But so much the better, if that is all, it\nis nothing, let me carry you to a bed. They will dress your wound; one\ndoes not die of a pierced hand.”\n\n\nShe murmured:—\n\n“The bullet traversed my hand, but it came out through my back. It is\nuseless to remove me from this spot. I will tell you how you can care\nfor me better than any surgeon. Sit down near me on this stone.”\n\n\nHe obeyed; she laid her head on Marius’ knees, and, without looking at\nhim, she said:—\n\n“Oh! How good this is! How comfortable this is! There; I no longer\nsuffer.”\n\n\nShe remained silent for a moment, then she turned her face with an\neffort, and looked at Marius.\n\n“Do you know what, Monsieur Marius? It puzzled me because you entered\nthat garden; it was stupid, because it was I who showed you that house;\nand then, I ought to have said to myself that a young man like you—”\n\n\nShe paused, and overstepping the sombre transitions that undoubtedly\nexisted in her mind, she resumed with a heartrending smile:—\n\n“You thought me ugly, didn’t you?”\n\n\nShe continued:—\n\n“You see, you are lost! Now, no one can get out of the barricade. It\nwas I who led you here, by the way! You are going to die, I count upon\nthat. And yet, when I saw them taking aim at you, I put my hand on the\nmuzzle of the gun. How queer it is! But it was because I wanted to die\nbefore you. When I received that bullet, I dragged myself here, no one\nsaw me, no one picked me up, I was waiting for you, I said: ‘So he is\nnot coming!’ Oh, if you only knew. I bit my blouse, I suffered so! Now\nI am well. Do you remember the day I entered your chamber and when I\nlooked at myself in your mirror, and the day when I came to you on the\nboulevard near the washerwomen? How the birds sang! That was a long\ntime ago. You gave me a hundred sous, and I said to you: ‘I don’t want\nyour money.’ I hope you picked up your coin? You are not rich. I did\nnot think to tell you to pick it up. The sun was shining bright, and it\nwas not cold. Do you remember, Monsieur Marius? Oh! How happy I am!\nEvery one is going to die.”\n\n\nShe had a mad, grave, and heart-breaking air. Her torn blouse disclosed\nher bare throat.\n\nAs she talked, she pressed her pierced hand to her breast, where there\nwas another hole, and whence there spurted from moment to moment a\nstream of blood, like a jet of wine from an open bung-hole.\n\nMarius gazed at this unfortunate creature with profound compassion.\n\n“Oh!” she resumed, “it is coming again, I am stifling!”\n\n\nShe caught up her blouse and bit it, and her limbs stiffened on the\npavement.\n\nAt that moment the young cock’s crow executed by little Gavroche\nresounded through the barricade.\n\nThe child had mounted a table to load his gun, and was singing gayly\nthe song then so popular:—\n\n“En voyant Lafayette,             “On beholding Lafayette,\nLe gendarme répète:—             The gendarme repeats:—\nSauvons nous! sauvons nous!       Let us flee! let us flee!\nsauvons nous!”                     let us flee!\n\n\nÉponine raised herself and listened; then she murmured:—\n\n“It is he.”\n\n\nAnd turning to Marius:—\n\n“My brother is here. He must not see me. He would scold me.”\n\n\n“Your brother?” inquired Marius, who was meditating in the most bitter\nand sorrowful depths of his heart on the duties to the Thénardiers\nwhich his father had bequeathed to him; “who is your brother?”\n\n\n“That little fellow.”\n\n\n“The one who is singing?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\nMarius made a movement.\n\n“Oh! don’t go away,” said she, “it will not be long now.”\n\n\nShe was sitting almost upright, but her voice was very low and broken\nby hiccoughs.\n\nAt intervals, the death rattle interrupted her. She put her face as\nnear that of Marius as possible. She added with a strange expression:—\n\n“Listen, I do not wish to play you a trick. I have a letter in my\npocket for you. I was told to put it in the post. I kept it. I did not\nwant to have it reach you. But perhaps you will be angry with me for it\nwhen we meet again presently? Take your letter.”\n\n\nShe grasped Marius’ hand convulsively with her pierced hand, but she no\nlonger seemed to feel her sufferings. She put Marius’ hand in the\npocket of her blouse. There, in fact, Marius felt a paper.\n\n“Take it,” said she.\n\nMarius took the letter.\n\nShe made a sign of satisfaction and contentment.\n\n“Now, for my trouble, promise me—”\n\n\nAnd she stopped.\n\n“What?” asked Marius.\n\n“Promise me!”\n\n\n“I promise.”\n\n\n“Promise to give me a kiss on my brow when I am dead.—I shall feel it.”\n\n\nShe dropped her head again on Marius’ knees, and her eyelids closed. He\nthought the poor soul had departed. Éponine remained motionless. All at\nonce, at the very moment when Marius fancied her asleep forever, she\nslowly opened her eyes in which appeared the sombre profundity of\ndeath, and said to him in a tone whose sweetness seemed already to\nproceed from another world:—\n\n“And by the way, Monsieur Marius, I believe that I was a little bit in\nlove with you.”\n\n\nShe tried to smile once more and expired.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—GAVROCHE AS A PROFOUND CALCULATOR OF DISTANCES\n\n\nMarius kept his promise. He dropped a kiss on that livid brow, where\nthe icy perspiration stood in beads.\n\nThis was no infidelity to Cosette; it was a gentle and pensive farewell\nto an unhappy soul.\n\nIt was not without a tremor that he had taken the letter which Éponine\nhad given him. He had immediately felt that it was an event of weight.\nHe was impatient to read it. The heart of man is so constituted that\nthe unhappy child had hardly closed her eyes when Marius began to think\nof unfolding this paper.\n\nHe laid her gently on the ground, and went away. Something told him\nthat he could not peruse that letter in the presence of that body.\n\nHe drew near to a candle in the tap-room. It was a small note, folded\nand sealed with a woman’s elegant care. The address was in a woman’s\nhand and ran:—\n\n“To Monsieur, Monsieur Marius Pontmercy, at M. Courfeyrac’s, Rue de la\nVerrerie, No. 16.”\n\n\nHe broke the seal and read:—\n\n“My dearest, alas! my father insists on our setting out immediately.\nWe shall be this evening in the Rue de l’Homme Armé, No. 7.\nIn a week we shall be in England.  COSETTE.  June 4th.”\n\n\nSuch was the innocence of their love that Marius was not even\nacquainted with Cosette’s handwriting.\n\nWhat had taken place may be related in a few words. Éponine had been\nthe cause of everything. After the evening of the 3d of June she had\ncherished a double idea, to defeat the projects of her father and the\nruffians on the house of the Rue Plumet, and to separate Marius and\nCosette. She had exchanged rags with the first young scamp she came\nacross who had thought it amusing to dress like a woman, while Éponine\ndisguised herself like a man. It was she who had conveyed to Jean\nValjean in the Champ de Mars the expressive warning: “Leave your\nhouse.” Jean Valjean had, in fact, returned home, and had said to\nCosette: “We set out this evening and we go to the Rue de l’Homme Armé\nwith Toussaint. Next week, we shall be in London.” Cosette, utterly\noverwhelmed by this unexpected blow, had hastily penned a couple of\nlines to Marius. But how was she to get the letter to the post? She\nnever went out alone, and Toussaint, surprised at such a commission,\nwould certainly show the letter to M. Fauchelevent. In this dilemma,\nCosette had caught sight through the fence of Éponine in man’s clothes,\nwho now prowled incessantly around the garden. Cosette had called to\n“this young workman” and had handed him five francs and the letter,\nsaying: “Carry this letter immediately to its address.” Éponine had put\nthe letter in her pocket. The next day, on the 5th of June, she went to\nCourfeyrac’s quarters to inquire for Marius, not for the purpose of\ndelivering the letter, but,—a thing which every jealous and loving soul\nwill comprehend,—“to see.” There she had waited for Marius, or at least\nfor Courfeyrac, still for the purpose of _seeing_. When Courfeyrac had\ntold her: “We are going to the barricades,” an idea flashed through her\nmind, to fling herself into that death, as she would have done into any\nother, and to thrust Marius into it also. She had followed Courfeyrac,\nhad made sure of the locality where the barricade was in process of\nconstruction; and, quite certain, since Marius had received no warning,\nand since she had intercepted the letter, that he would go at dusk to\nhis trysting place for every evening, she had betaken herself to the\nRue Plumet, had there awaited Marius, and had sent him, in the name of\nhis friends, the appeal which would, she thought, lead him to the\nbarricade. She reckoned on Marius’ despair when he should fail to find\nCosette; she was not mistaken. She had returned to the Rue de la\nChanvrerie herself. What she did there the reader has just seen. She\ndied with the tragic joy of jealous hearts who drag the beloved being\ninto their own death, and who say: “No one shall have him!”\n\n\nMarius covered Cosette’s letter with kisses. So she loved him! For one\nmoment the idea occurred to him that he ought not to die now. Then he\nsaid to himself: “She is going away. Her father is taking her to\nEngland, and my grandfather refuses his consent to the marriage.\nNothing is changed in our fates.” Dreamers like Marius are subject to\nsupreme attacks of dejection, and desperate resolves are the result.\nThe fatigue of living is insupportable; death is sooner over with. Then\nhe reflected that he had still two duties to fulfil: to inform Cosette\nof his death and send her a final farewell, and to save from the\nimpending catastrophe which was in preparation, that poor child,\nÉponine’s brother and Thénardier’s son.\n\nHe had a pocket-book about him; the same one which had contained the\nnote-book in which he had inscribed so many thoughts of love for\nCosette. He tore out a leaf and wrote on it a few lines in pencil:—\n\n“Our marriage was impossible. I asked my grandfather, he refused; I\nhave no fortune, neither hast thou. I hastened to thee, thou wert no\nlonger there. Thou knowest the promise that I gave thee, I shall keep\nit. I die. I love thee. When thou readest this, my soul will be near\nthee, and thou wilt smile.”\n\n\nHaving nothing wherewith to seal this letter, he contented himself with\nfolding the paper in four, and added the address:—\n\n“To Mademoiselle Cosette Fauchelevent, at M. Fauchelevent’s, Rue de\nl’Homme Armé, No. 7.”\n\n\nHaving folded the letter, he stood in thought for a moment, drew out\nhis pocket-book again, opened it, and wrote, with the same pencil,\nthese four lines on the first page:—\n\n“My name is Marius Pontmercy. Carry my body to my grandfather, M.\nGillenormand, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the Marais.”\n\n\nHe put his pocketbook back in his pocket, then he called Gavroche.\n\nThe gamin, at the sound of Marius’ voice, ran up to him with his merry\nand devoted air.\n\n“Will you do something for me?”\n\n\n“Anything,” said Gavroche. “Good God! if it had not been for you, I\nshould have been done for.”\n\n\n“Do you see this letter?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Take it. Leave the barricade instantly” (Gavroche began to scratch his\near uneasily) “and to-morrow morning, you will deliver it at its\naddress to Mademoiselle Cosette, at M. Fauchelevent’s, Rue de l’Homme\nArmé, No. 7.”\n\n\nThe heroic child replied\n\n“Well, but! in the meanwhile the barricade will be taken, and I shall\nnot be there.”\n\n\n“The barricade will not be attacked until daybreak, according to all\nappearances, and will not be taken before to-morrow noon.”\n\n\nThe fresh respite which the assailants were granting to the barricade\nhad, in fact, been prolonged. It was one of those intermissions which\nfrequently occur in nocturnal combats, which are always followed by an\nincrease of rage.\n\n“Well,” said Gavroche, “what if I were to go and carry your letter\nto-morrow?”\n\n\n“It will be too late. The barricade will probably be blockaded, all the\nstreets will be guarded, and you will not be able to get out. Go at\nonce.”\n\n\nGavroche could think of no reply to this, and stood there in\nindecision, scratching his ear sadly.\n\nAll at once, he took the letter with one of those birdlike movements\nwhich were common with him.\n\n“All right,” said he.\n\nAnd he started off at a run through Mondétour lane.\n\nAn idea had occurred to Gavroche which had brought him to a decision,\nbut he had not mentioned it for fear that Marius might offer some\nobjection to it.\n\nThis was the idea:—\n\n“It is barely midnight, the Rue de l’Homme Armé is not far off; I will\ngo and deliver the letter at once, and I shall get back in time.”\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEENTH—THE RUE DE L’HOMME ARMÉ\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—A DRINKER IS A BABBLER\n\n\nWhat are the convulsions of a city in comparison with the insurrections\nof the soul? Man is a depth still greater than the people. Jean Valjean\nat that very moment was the prey of a terrible upheaval. Every sort of\ngulf had opened again within him. He also was trembling, like Paris, on\nthe brink of an obscure and formidable revolution. A few hours had\nsufficed to bring this about. His destiny and his conscience had\nsuddenly been covered with gloom. Of him also, as well as of Paris, it\nmight have been said: “Two principles are face to face. The white angel\nand the black angel are about to seize each other on the bridge of the\nabyss. Which of the two will hurl the other over? Who will carry the\nday?”\n\n\nOn the evening preceding this same 5th of June, Jean Valjean,\naccompanied by Cosette and Toussaint had installed himself in the Rue\nde l’Homme Armé. A change awaited him there.\n\nCosette had not quitted the Rue Plumet without making an effort at\nresistance. For the first time since they had lived side by side,\nCosette’s will and the will of Jean Valjean had proved to be distinct,\nand had been in opposition, at least, if they had not clashed. There\nhad been objections on one side and inflexibility on the other. The\nabrupt advice: “Leave your house,” hurled at Jean Valjean by a\nstranger, had alarmed him to the extent of rendering him peremptory. He\nthought that he had been traced and followed. Cosette had been obliged\nto give way.\n\nBoth had arrived in the Rue de l’Homme Armé without opening their lips,\nand without uttering a word, each being absorbed in his own personal\npreoccupation; Jean Valjean so uneasy that he did not notice Cosette’s\nsadness, Cosette so sad that she did not notice Jean Valjean’s\nuneasiness.\n\nJean Valjean had taken Toussaint with him, a thing which he had never\ndone in his previous absences. He perceived the possibility of not\nreturning to the Rue Plumet, and he could neither leave Toussaint\nbehind nor confide his secret to her. Besides, he felt that she was\ndevoted and trustworthy. Treachery between master and servant begins in\ncuriosity. Now Toussaint, as though she had been destined to be Jean\nValjean’s servant, was not curious. She stammered in her peasant\ndialect of Barneville: “I am made so; I do my work; the rest is no\naffair of mine.”\n\n\nIn this departure from the Rue Plumet, which had been almost a flight,\nJean Valjean had carried away nothing but the little embalmed valise,\nbaptized by Cosette “the inseparable.” Full trunks would have required\nporters, and porters are witnesses. A fiacre had been summoned to the\ndoor on the Rue de Babylone, and they had taken their departure.\n\nIt was with difficulty that Toussaint had obtained permission to pack\nup a little linen and clothes and a few toilet articles. Cosette had\ntaken only her portfolio and her blotting-book.\n\nJean Valjean, with a view to augmenting the solitude and the mystery of\nthis departure, had arranged to quit the pavilion of the Rue Plumet\nonly at dusk, which had allowed Cosette time to write her note to\nMarius. They had arrived in the Rue de l’Homme Armé after night had\nfully fallen.\n\nThey had gone to bed in silence.\n\nThe lodgings in the Rue de l’Homme Armé were situated on a back court,\non the second floor, and were composed of two sleeping-rooms, a\ndining-room and a kitchen adjoining the dining-room, with a garret\nwhere there was a folding-bed, and which fell to Toussaint’s share. The\ndining-room was an antechamber as well, and separated the two bedrooms.\nThe apartment was provided with all necessary utensils.\n\nPeople re-acquire confidence as foolishly as they lose it; human nature\nis so constituted. Hardly had Jean Valjean reached the Rue de l’Homme\nArmé when his anxiety was lightened and by degrees dissipated. There\nare soothing spots which act in some sort mechanically on the mind. An\nobscure street, peaceable inhabitants. Jean Valjean experienced an\nindescribable contagion of tranquillity in that alley of ancient Paris,\nwhich is so narrow that it is barred against carriages by a transverse\nbeam placed on two posts, which is deaf and dumb in the midst of the\nclamorous city, dimly lighted at midday, and is, so to speak, incapable\nof emotions between two rows of lofty houses centuries old, which hold\ntheir peace like ancients as they are. There was a touch of stagnant\noblivion in that street. Jean Valjean drew his breath once more there.\nHow could he be found there?\n\nHis first care was to place _the inseparable_ beside him.\n\nHe slept well. Night brings wisdom; we may add, night soothes. On the\nfollowing morning he awoke in a mood that was almost gay. He thought\nthe dining-room charming, though it was hideous, furnished with an old\nround table, a long sideboard surmounted by a slanting mirror, a\ndilapidated armchair, and several plain chairs which were encumbered\nwith Toussaint’s packages. In one of these packages Jean Valjean’s\nuniform of a National Guard was visible through a rent.\n\nAs for Cosette, she had had Toussaint take some broth to her room, and\ndid not make her appearance until evening.\n\nAbout five o’clock, Toussaint, who was going and coming and busying\nherself with the tiny establishment, set on the table a cold chicken,\nwhich Cosette, out of deference to her father, consented to glance at.\n\nThat done, Cosette, under the pretext of an obstinate sick headache,\nhad bade Jean Valjean good night and had shut herself up in her\nchamber. Jean Valjean had eaten a wing of the chicken with a good\nappetite, and with his elbows on the table, having gradually recovered\nhis serenity, had regained possession of his sense of security.\n\nWhile he was discussing this modest dinner, he had, twice or thrice,\nnoticed in a confused way, Toussaint’s stammering words as she said to\nhim: “Monsieur, there is something going on, they are fighting in\nParis.” But absorbed in a throng of inward calculations, he had paid no\nheed to it. To tell the truth, he had not heard her. He rose and began\nto pace from the door to the window and from the window to the door,\ngrowing ever more serene.\n\nWith this calm, Cosette, his sole anxiety, recurred to his thoughts.\nNot that he was troubled by this headache, a little nervous crisis, a\nyoung girl’s fit of sulks, the cloud of a moment, there would be\nnothing left of it in a day or two; but he meditated on the future,\nand, as was his habit, he thought of it with pleasure. After all, he\nsaw no obstacle to their happy life resuming its course. At certain\nhours, everything seems impossible, at others everything appears easy;\nJean Valjean was in the midst of one of these good hours. They\ngenerally succeed the bad ones, as day follows night, by virtue of that\nlaw of succession and of contrast which lies at the very foundation of\nnature, and which superficial minds call antithesis. In this peaceful\nstreet where he had taken refuge, Jean Valjean got rid of all that had\nbeen troubling him for some time past. This very fact, that he had seen\nmany shadows, made him begin to perceive a little azure. To have\nquitted the Rue Plumet without complications or incidents was one good\nstep already accomplished. Perhaps it would be wise to go abroad, if\nonly for a few months, and to set out for London. Well, they would go.\nWhat difference did it make to him whether he was in France or in\nEngland, provided he had Cosette beside him? Cosette was his nation.\nCosette sufficed for his happiness; the idea that he, perhaps, did not\nsuffice for Cosette’s happiness, that idea which had formerly been the\ncause of his fever and sleeplessness, did not even present itself to\nhis mind. He was in a state of collapse from all his past sufferings,\nand he was fully entered on optimism. Cosette was by his side, she\nseemed to be his; an optical illusion which every one has experienced.\nHe arranged in his own mind, with all sorts of felicitous devices, his\ndeparture for England with Cosette, and he beheld his felicity\nreconstituted wherever he pleased, in the perspective of his reverie.\n\nAs he paced to and fro with long strides, his glance suddenly\nencountered something strange.\n\nIn the inclined mirror facing him which surmounted the sideboard, he\nsaw the four lines which follow:—\n\n“My dearest, alas! my father insists on our setting out immediately. We\nshall be this evening in the Rue de l’Homme Armé, No. 7. In a week we\nshall be in England. COSETTE. June 4th.”\n\n\nJean Valjean halted, perfectly haggard.\n\nCosette on her arrival had placed her blotting-book on the sideboard in\nfront of the mirror, and, utterly absorbed in her agony of grief, had\nforgotten it and left it there, without even observing that she had\nleft it wide open, and open at precisely the page on which she had laid\nto dry the four lines which she had penned, and which she had given in\ncharge of the young workman in the Rue Plumet. The writing had been\nprinted off on the blotter.\n\nThe mirror reflected the writing.\n\nThe result was, what is called in geometry, _the symmetrical image_; so\nthat the writing, reversed on the blotter, was righted in the mirror\nand presented its natural appearance; and Jean Valjean had beneath his\neyes the letter written by Cosette to Marius on the preceding evening.\n\nIt was simple and withering.\n\nJean Valjean stepped up to the mirror. He read the four lines again,\nbut he did not believe them. They produced on him the effect of\nappearing in a flash of lightning. It was a hallucination, it was\nimpossible. It was not so.\n\nLittle by little, his perceptions became more precise; he looked at\nCosette’s blotting-book, and the consciousness of the reality returned\nto him. He caught up the blotter and said: “It comes from there.” He\nfeverishly examined the four lines imprinted on the blotter, the\nreversal of the letters converted into an odd scrawl, and he saw no\nsense in it. Then he said to himself: “But this signifies nothing;\nthere is nothing written here.” And he drew a long breath with\ninexpressible relief. Who has not experienced those foolish joys in\nhorrible instants? The soul does not surrender to despair until it has\nexhausted all illusions.\n\nHe held the blotter in his hand and contemplated it in stupid delight,\nalmost ready to laugh at the hallucination of which he had been the\ndupe. All at once his eyes fell upon the mirror again, and again he\nbeheld the vision. There were the four lines outlined with inexorable\nclearness. This time it was no mirage. The recurrence of a vision is a\nreality; it was palpable, it was the writing restored in the mirror. He\nunderstood.\n\nJean Valjean tottered, dropped the blotter, and fell into the old\narmchair beside the buffet, with drooping head, and glassy eyes, in\nutter bewilderment. He told himself that it was plain, that the light\nof the world had been eclipsed forever, and that Cosette had written\nthat to some one. Then he heard his soul, which had become terrible\nonce more, give vent to a dull roar in the gloom. Try then the effect\nof taking from the lion the dog which he has in his cage!\n\nStrange and sad to say, at that very moment, Marius had not yet\nreceived Cosette’s letter; chance had treacherously carried it to Jean\nValjean before delivering it to Marius. Up to that day, Jean Valjean\nhad not been vanquished by trial. He had been subjected to fearful\nproofs; no violence of bad fortune had been spared him; the ferocity of\nfate, armed with all vindictiveness and all social scorn, had taken him\nfor her prey and had raged against him. He had accepted every extremity\nwhen it had been necessary; he had sacrificed his inviolability as a\nreformed man, had yielded up his liberty, risked his head, lost\neverything, suffered everything, and he had remained disinterested and\nstoical to such a point that he might have been thought to be absent\nfrom himself like a martyr. His conscience inured to every assault of\ndestiny, might have appeared to be forever impregnable. Well, any one\nwho had beheld his spiritual self would have been obliged to concede\nthat it weakened at that moment. It was because, of all the tortures\nwhich he had undergone in the course of this long inquisition to which\ndestiny had doomed him, this was the most terrible. Never had such\npincers seized him hitherto. He felt the mysterious stirring of all his\nlatent sensibilities. He felt the plucking at the strange chord. Alas!\nthe supreme trial, let us say rather, the only trial, is the loss of\nthe beloved being.\n\nPoor old Jean Valjean certainly did not love Cosette otherwise than as\na father; but we have already remarked, above, that into this paternity\nthe widowhood of his life had introduced all the shades of love; he\nloved Cosette as his daughter, and he loved her as his mother, and he\nloved her as his sister; and, as he had never had either a woman to\nlove or a wife, as nature is a creditor who accepts no protest, that\nsentiment also, the most impossible to lose, was mingled with the rest,\nvague, ignorant, pure with the purity of blindness, unconscious,\ncelestial, angelic, divine; less like a sentiment than like an\ninstinct, less like an instinct than like an imperceptible and\ninvisible but real attraction; and love, properly speaking, was, in his\nimmense tenderness for Cosette, like the thread of gold in the\nmountain, concealed and virgin.\n\nLet the reader recall the situation of heart which we have already\nindicated. No marriage was possible between them; not even that of\nsouls; and yet, it is certain that their destinies were wedded. With\nthe exception of Cosette, that is to say, with the exception of a\nchildhood, Jean Valjean had never, in the whole of his long life, known\nanything of that which may be loved. The passions and loves which\nsucceed each other had not produced in him those successive green\ngrowths, tender green or dark green, which can be seen in foliage which\npasses through the winter and in men who pass fifty. In short, and we\nhave insisted on it more than once, all this interior fusion, all this\nwhole, of which the sum total was a lofty virtue, ended in rendering\nJean Valjean a father to Cosette. A strange father, forged from the\ngrandfather, the son, the brother, and the husband, that existed in\nJean Valjean; a father in whom there was included even a mother; a\nfather who loved Cosette and adored her, and who held that child as his\nlight, his home, his family, his country, his paradise.\n\nThus when he saw that the end had absolutely come, that she was\nescaping from him, that she was slipping from his hands, that she was\ngliding from him, like a cloud, like water, when he had before his eyes\nthis crushing proof: “another is the goal of her heart, another is the\nwish of her life; there is a dearest one, I am no longer anything but\nher father, I no longer exist”; when he could no longer doubt, when he\nsaid to himself: “She is going away from me!” the grief which he felt\nsurpassed the bounds of possibility. To have done all that he had done\nfor the purpose of ending like this! And the very idea of being\nnothing! Then, as we have just said, a quiver of revolt ran through him\nfrom head to foot. He felt, even in the very roots of his hair, the\nimmense reawakening of egotism, and the _I_ in this man’s abyss howled.\n\nThere is such a thing as the sudden giving way of the inward subsoil. A\ndespairing certainty does not make its way into a man without thrusting\naside and breaking certain profound elements which, in some cases, are\nthe very man himself. Grief, when it attains this shape, is a headlong\nflight of all the forces of the conscience. These are fatal crises. Few\namong us emerge from them still like ourselves and firm in duty. When\nthe limit of endurance is overstepped, the most imperturbable virtue is\ndisconcerted. Jean Valjean took the blotter again, and convinced\nhimself afresh; he remained bowed and as though petrified and with\nstaring eyes, over those four unobjectionable lines; and there arose\nwithin him such a cloud that one might have thought that everything in\nthis soul was crumbling away.\n\nHe examined this revelation, athwart the exaggerations of reverie, with\nan apparent and terrifying calmness, for it is a fearful thing when a\nman’s calmness reaches the coldness of the statue.\n\nHe measured the terrible step which his destiny had taken without his\nhaving a suspicion of the fact; he recalled his fears of the preceding\nsummer, so foolishly dissipated; he recognized the precipice, it was\nstill the same; only, Jean Valjean was no longer on the brink, he was\nat the bottom of it.\n\nThe unprecedented and heart-rending thing about it was that he had\nfallen without perceiving it. All the light of his life had departed,\nwhile he still fancied that he beheld the sun.\n\nHis instinct did not hesitate. He put together certain circumstances,\ncertain dates, certain blushes and certain pallors on Cosette’s part,\nand he said to himself: “It is he.”\n\n\nThe divination of despair is a sort of mysterious bow which never\nmisses its aim. He struck Marius with his first conjecture. He did not\nknow the name, but he found the man instantly. He distinctly perceived,\nin the background of the implacable conjuration of his memories, the\nunknown prowler of the Luxembourg, that wretched seeker of love\nadventures, that idler of romance, that idiot, that coward, for it is\ncowardly to come and make eyes at young girls who have beside them a\nfather who loves them.\n\nAfter he had thoroughly verified the fact that this young man was at\nthe bottom of this situation, and that everything proceeded from that\nquarter, he, Jean Valjean, the regenerated man, the man who had so\nlabored over his soul, the man who had made so many efforts to resolve\nall life, all misery, and all unhappiness into love, looked into his\nown breast and there beheld a spectre, Hate.\n\nGreat griefs contain something of dejection. They discourage one with\nexistence. The man into whom they enter feels something within him\nwithdraw from him. In his youth, their visits are lugubrious; later on\nthey are sinister. Alas, if despair is a fearful thing when the blood\nis hot, when the hair is black, when the head is erect on the body like\nthe flame on the torch, when the roll of destiny still retains its full\nthickness, when the heart, full of desirable love, still possesses\nbeats which can be returned to it, when one has time for redress, when\nall women and all smiles and all the future and all the horizon are\nbefore one, when the force of life is complete, what is it in old age,\nwhen the years hasten on, growing ever paler, to that twilight hour\nwhen one begins to behold the stars of the tomb?\n\nWhile he was meditating, Toussaint entered. Jean Valjean rose and asked\nher:—\n\n“In what quarter is it? Do you know?”\n\n\nToussaint was struck dumb, and could only answer him:—\n\n“What is it, sir?”\n\n\nJean Valjean began again: “Did you not tell me that just now that there\nis fighting going on?”\n\n\n“Ah! yes, sir,” replied Toussaint. “It is in the direction of\nSaint-Merry.”\n\n\nThere is a mechanical movement which comes to us, unconsciously, from\nthe most profound depths of our thought. It was, no doubt, under the\nimpulse of a movement of this sort, and of which he was hardly\nconscious, that Jean Valjean, five minutes later, found himself in the\nstreet.\n\nBareheaded, he sat upon the stone post at the door of his house. He\nseemed to be listening.\n\nNight had come.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—THE STREET URCHIN AN ENEMY OF LIGHT\n\n\nHow long did he remain thus? What was the ebb and flow of this tragic\nmeditation? Did he straighten up? Did he remain bowed? Had he been bent\nto breaking? Could he still rise and regain his footing in his\nconscience upon something solid? He probably would not have been able\nto tell himself.\n\nThe street was deserted. A few uneasy bourgeois, who were rapidly\nreturning home, hardly saw him. Each one for himself in times of peril.\nThe lamp-lighter came as usual to light the lantern which was situated\nprecisely opposite the door of No. 7, and then went away. Jean Valjean\nwould not have appeared like a living man to any one who had examined\nhim in that shadow. He sat there on the post of his door, motionless as\na form of ice. There is congealment in despair. The alarm bells and a\nvague and stormy uproar were audible. In the midst of all these\nconvulsions of the bell mingled with the revolt, the clock of\nSaint-Paul struck eleven, gravely and without haste; for the tocsin is\nman; the hour is God. The passage of the hour produced no effect on\nJean Valjean; Jean Valjean did not stir. Still, at about that moment, a\nbrusque report burst forth in the direction of the Halles, a second yet\nmore violent followed; it was probably that attack on the barricade in\nthe Rue de la Chanvrerie which we have just seen repulsed by Marius. At\nthis double discharge, whose fury seemed augmented by the stupor of the\nnight, Jean Valjean started; he rose, turning towards the quarter\nwhence the noise proceeded; then he fell back upon the post again,\nfolded his arms, and his head slowly sank on his bosom again.\n\nHe resumed his gloomy dialogue with himself.\n\nAll at once, he raised his eyes; some one was walking in the street, he\nheard steps near him. He looked, and by the light of the lanterns, in\nthe direction of the street which ran into the Rue-aux-Archives, he\nperceived a young, livid, and beaming face.\n\nGavroche had just arrived in the Rue de l’Homme Armé.\n\nGavroche was staring into the air, apparently in search of something.\nHe saw Jean Valjean perfectly well but he took no notice of him.\n\nGavroche after staring into the air, stared below; he raised himself on\ntiptoe, and felt of the doors and windows of the ground floor; they\nwere all shut, bolted, and padlocked. After having authenticated the\nfronts of five or six barricaded houses in this manner, the urchin\nshrugged his shoulders, and took himself to task in these terms:—\n\n“Pardi!”\n\n\nThen he began to stare into the air again.\n\nJean Valjean, who, an instant previously, in his then state of mind,\nwould not have spoken to or even answered any one, felt irresistibly\nimpelled to accost that child.\n\n“What is the matter with you, my little fellow?” he said.\n\n“The matter with me is that I am hungry,” replied Gavroche frankly. And\nhe added: “Little fellow yourself.”\n\n\nJean Valjean fumbled in his fob and pulled out a five-franc piece.\n\nBut Gavroche, who was of the wagtail species, and who skipped\nvivaciously from one gesture to another, had just picked up a stone. He\nhad caught sight of the lantern.\n\n“See here,” said he, “you still have your lanterns here. You are\ndisobeying the regulations, my friend. This is disorderly. Smash that\nfor me.”\n\n\nAnd he flung the stone at the lantern, whose broken glass fell with\nsuch a clatter that the bourgeois in hiding behind their curtains in\nthe opposite house cried: “There is ‘Ninety-three’ come again.”\n\n\nThe lantern oscillated violently, and went out. The street had suddenly\nbecome black.\n\n“That’s right, old street,” ejaculated Gavroche, “put on your\nnight-cap.”\n\n\nAnd turning to Jean Valjean:—\n\n“What do you call that gigantic monument that you have there at the end\nof the street? It’s the Archives, isn’t it? I must crumble up those big\nstupids of pillars a bit and make a nice barricade out of them.”\n\n\nJean Valjean stepped up to Gavroche.\n\n“Poor creature,” he said in a low tone, and speaking to himself, “he is\nhungry.”\n\n\nAnd he laid the hundred-sou piece in his hand.\n\nGavroche raised his face, astonished at the size of this sou; he stared\nat it in the darkness, and the whiteness of the big sou dazzled him. He\nknew five-franc pieces by hearsay; their reputation was agreeable to\nhim; he was delighted to see one close to. He said:—\n\n“Let us contemplate the tiger.”\n\n\nHe gazed at it for several minutes in ecstasy; then, turning to Jean\nValjean, he held out the coin to him, and said majestically to him:—\n\n“Bourgeois, I prefer to smash lanterns. Take back your ferocious beast.\nYou can’t bribe me. That has got five claws; but it doesn’t scratch\nme.”\n\n\n“Have you a mother?” asked Jean Valjean.\n\nGavroche replied:—\n\n“More than you have, perhaps.”\n\n\n“Well,” returned Jean Valjean, “keep the money for your mother!”\n\n\nGavroche was touched. Moreover, he had just noticed that the man who\nwas addressing him had no hat, and this inspired him with confidence.\n\n“Truly,” said he, “so it wasn’t to keep me from breaking the lanterns?”\n\n\n“Break whatever you please.”\n\n\n“You’re a fine man,” said Gavroche.\n\nAnd he put the five-franc piece into one of his pockets.\n\nHis confidence having increased, he added:—\n\n“Do you belong in this street?”\n\n\n“Yes, why?”\n\n\n“Can you tell me where No. 7 is?”\n\n\n“What do you want with No. 7?”\n\n\nHere the child paused, he feared that he had said too much; he thrust\nhis nails energetically into his hair and contented himself with\nreplying:—\n\n“Ah! Here it is.”\n\n\nAn idea flashed through Jean Valjean’s mind. Anguish does have these\ngleams. He said to the lad:—\n\n“Are you the person who is bringing a letter that I am expecting?”\n\n\n“You?” said Gavroche. “You are not a woman.”\n\n\n“The letter is for Mademoiselle Cosette, is it not?”\n\n\n“Cosette,” muttered Gavroche. “Yes, I believe that is the queer name.”\n\n\n“Well,” resumed Jean Valjean, “I am the person to whom you are to\ndeliver the letter. Give it here.”\n\n\n“In that case, you must know that I was sent from the barricade.”\n\n\n“Of course,” said Jean Valjean.\n\nGavroche engulfed his hand in another of his pockets and drew out a\npaper folded in four.\n\nThen he made the military salute.\n\n“Respect for despatches,” said he. “It comes from the Provisional\nGovernment.”\n\n\n“Give it to me,” said Jean Valjean.\n\nGavroche held the paper elevated above his head.\n\n“Don’t go and fancy it’s a love letter. It is for a woman, but it’s for\nthe people. We men fight and we respect the fair sex. We are not as\nthey are in fine society, where there are lions who send chickens55 to\ncamels.”\n\n\n“Give it to me.”\n\n\n“After all,” continued Gavroche, “you have the air of an honest man.”\n\n\n“Give it to me quick.”\n\n\n“Catch hold of it.”\n\n\nAnd he handed the paper to Jean Valjean.\n\n“And make haste, Monsieur What’s-your-name, for Mamselle Cosette is\nwaiting.”\n\n\nGavroche was satisfied with himself for having produced this remark.\n\nJean Valjean began again:—\n\n“Is it to Saint-Merry that the answer is to be sent?”\n\n\n“There you are making some of those bits of pastry vulgarly called\n_brioches_ [blunders]. This letter comes from the barricade of the Rue\nde la Chanvrerie, and I’m going back there. Good evening, citizen.”\n\n\nThat said, Gavroche took himself off, or, to describe it more exactly,\nfluttered away in the direction whence he had come with a flight like\nthat of an escaped bird. He plunged back into the gloom as though he\nmade a hole in it, with the rigid rapidity of a projectile; the alley\nof l’Homme Armé became silent and solitary once more; in a twinkling,\nthat strange child, who had about him something of the shadow and of\nthe dream, had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses,\nand was lost there, like smoke in the dark; and one might have thought\nthat he had dissipated and vanished, had there not taken place, a few\nminutes after his disappearance, a startling shiver of glass, and had\nnot the magnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement\nonce more abruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois. It was Gavroche\nupon his way through the Rue du Chaume.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—WHILE COSETTE AND TOUSSAINT ARE ASLEEP\n\n\nJean Valjean went into the house with Marius’ letter.\n\nHe groped his way up the stairs, as pleased with the darkness as an owl\nwho grips his prey, opened and shut his door softly, listened to see\nwhether he could hear any noise,—made sure that, to all appearances,\nCosette and Toussaint were asleep, and plunged three or four matches\ninto the bottle of the Fumade lighter before he could evoke a spark, so\ngreatly did his hand tremble. What he had just done smacked of theft.\nAt last the candle was lighted; he leaned his elbows on the table,\nunfolded the paper, and read.\n\nIn violent emotions, one does not read, one flings to the earth, so to\nspeak, the paper which one holds, one clutches it like a victim, one\ncrushes it, one digs into it the nails of one’s wrath, or of one’s joy;\none hastens to the end, one leaps to the beginning; attention is at\nfever heat; it takes up in the gross, as it were, the essential points;\nit seizes on one point, and the rest disappears. In Marius’ note to\nCosette, Jean Valjean saw only these words:—\n\n“I die. When thou readest this, my soul will be near thee.”\n\n\nIn the presence of these two lines, he was horribly dazzled; he\nremained for a moment, crushed, as it were, by the change of emotion\nwhich was taking place within him, he stared at Marius’ note with a\nsort of intoxicated amazement, he had before his eyes that splendor,\nthe death of a hated individual.\n\nHe uttered a frightful cry of inward joy. So it was all over. The\ncatastrophe had arrived sooner than he had dared to hope. The being who\nobstructed his destiny was disappearing. That man had taken himself off\nof his own accord, freely, willingly. This man was going to his death,\nand he, Jean Valjean, had had no hand in the matter, and it was through\nno fault of his. Perhaps, even, he is already dead. Here his fever\nentered into calculations. No, he is not dead yet. The letter had\nevidently been intended for Cosette to read on the following morning;\nafter the two discharges that were heard between eleven o’clock and\nmidnight, nothing more has taken place; the barricade will not be\nattacked seriously until daybreak; but that makes no difference, from\nthe moment when “that man” is concerned in this war, he is lost; he is\ncaught in the gearing. Jean Valjean felt himself delivered. So he was\nabout to find himself alone with Cosette once more. The rivalry would\ncease; the future was beginning again. He had but to keep this note in\nhis pocket. Cosette would never know what had become of that man. All\nthat there requires to be done is to let things take their own course.\nThis man cannot escape. If he is not already dead, it is certain that\nhe is about to die. What good fortune!\n\nHaving said all this to himself, he became gloomy.\n\nThen he went downstairs and woke up the porter.\n\nAbout an hour later, Jean Valjean went out in the complete costume of a\nNational Guard, and with his arms. The porter had easily found in the\nneighborhood the wherewithal to complete his equipment. He had a loaded\ngun and a cartridge-box filled with cartridges.\n\nHe strode off in the direction of the markets.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—GAVROCHE’S EXCESS OF ZEAL\n\n\nIn the meantime, Gavroche had had an adventure.\n\nGavroche, after having conscientiously stoned the lantern in the Rue du\nChaume, entered the Rue des Vieilles-Haudriettes, and not seeing “even\na cat” there, he thought the opportunity a good one to strike up all\nthe song of which he was capable. His march, far from being retarded by\nhis singing, was accelerated by it. He began to sow along the sleeping\nor terrified houses these incendiary couplets:—\n\n“L’oiseau médit dans les charmilles,\nEt prétend qu’hier Atala\nAvec un Russe s’en alla.\nOù vont les belles filles,\nLon la.\n\n“Mon ami Pierrot, tu babilles,\nParce que l’autre jour Mila\nCogna sa vitre et m’appela,\nOù vont les belles filles,\nLon la.\n\n“Les drôlesses sont fort gentilles,\nLeur poison qui m’ensorcela\nGriserait Monsieur Orfila.\nOù vont les belles filles,\nLon la.\n\n“J’aime l’amour et les bisbilles,\nJ’aime Agnès, j’aime Paméla,\nLise en m’allumant se brûla.\nOù vont les belles filles,\nLon la.\n\n“Jadis, quand je vis les mantilles\nDe Suzette et de Zéila,\nMon âme à leurs plis se mêla,\nOù vont les belles filles,\nLon la.\n\n“Amour, quand dans l’ombre où tu brilles,\nTu coiffes de roses Lola,\nJe me damnerais pour cela.\nOù vont les belles filles,\nLon la.\n\n“Jeanne à ton miroir tu t’habilles!\nMon cœur un beau jour s’envola.\nJe crois que c’est Jeanne qui l’a.\nOù vont les belles filles,\nLon la.\n\n“Le soir, en sortant des quadrilles,\nJe montre aux étoiles Stella,\nEt je leur dis: ‘Regardez-la.’\nOù vont les belles filles,\nLon la.\"56\n\n\nGavroche, as he sang, was lavish of his pantomime. Gesture is the\nstrong point of the refrain. His face, an inexhaustible repertory of\nmasks, produced grimaces more convulsing and more fantastic than the\nrents of a cloth torn in a high gale. Unfortunately, as he was alone,\nand as it was night, this was neither seen nor even visible. Such\nwastes of riches do occur.\n\nAll at once, he stopped short.\n\n“Let us interrupt the romance,” said he.\n\nHis feline eye had just descried, in the recess of a carriage door,\nwhat is called in painting, an _ensemble_, that is to say, a person and\na thing; the thing was a hand-cart, the person was a man from Auvergene\nwho was sleeping therein.\n\nThe shafts of the cart rested on the pavement, and the Auvergnat’s head\nwas supported against the front of the cart. His body was coiled up on\nthis inclined plane and his feet touched the ground.\n\nGavroche, with his experience of the things of this world, recognized a\ndrunken man. He was some corner errand-man who had drunk too much and\nwas sleeping too much.\n\n“There now,” thought Gavroche, “that’s what the summer nights are good\nfor. We’ll take the cart for the Republic, and leave the Auvergnat for\nthe Monarchy.”\n\n\nHis mind had just been illuminated by this flash of light:—\n\n“How bully that cart would look on our barricade!”\n\n\nThe Auvergnat was snoring.\n\nGavroche gently tugged at the cart from behind, and at the Auvergnat\nfrom the front, that is to say, by the feet, and at the expiration of\nanother minute the imperturbable Auvergnat was reposing flat on the\npavement.\n\nThe cart was free.\n\nGavroche, habituated to facing the unexpected in all quarters, had\neverything about him. He fumbled in one of his pockets, and pulled from\nit a scrap of paper and a bit of red pencil filched from some\ncarpenter.\n\nHe wrote:—\n\n_“French Republic.”_\n\n“Received thy cart.”\n\nAnd he signed it:  “GAVROCHE.”\n\n\nThat done, he put the paper in the pocket of the still snoring\nAuvergnat’s velvet vest, seized the cart shafts in both hands, and set\noff in the direction of the Halles, pushing the cart before him at a\nhard gallop with a glorious and triumphant uproar.\n\nThis was perilous. There was a post at the Royal Printing\nEstablishment. Gavroche did not think of this. This post was occupied\nby the National Guards of the suburbs. The squad began to wake up, and\nheads were raised from camp beds. Two street lanterns broken in\nsuccession, that ditty sung at the top of the lungs. This was a great\ndeal for those cowardly streets, which desire to go to sleep at sunset,\nand which put the extinguisher on their candles at such an early hour.\nFor the last hour, that boy had been creating an uproar in that\npeaceable arrondissement, the uproar of a fly in a bottle. The sergeant\nof the banlieue lent an ear. He waited. He was a prudent man.\n\nThe mad rattle of the cart, filled to overflowing the possible measure\nof waiting, and decided the sergeant to make a reconnaisance.\n\n“There’s a whole band of them there!” said he, “let us proceed gently.”\n\n\nIt was clear that the hydra of anarchy had emerged from its box and\nthat it was stalking abroad through the quarter.\n\nAnd the sergeant ventured out of the post with cautious tread.\n\nAll at once, Gavroche, pushing his cart in front of him, and at the\nvery moment when he was about to turn into the Rue des\nVieilles-Haudriettes, found himself face to face with a uniform, a\nshako, a plume, and a gun.\n\nFor the second time, he stopped short.\n\n“Hullo,” said he, “it’s him. Good day, public order.”\n\n\nGavroche’s amazement was always brief and speedily thawed.\n\n“Where are you going, you rascal?” shouted the sergeant.\n\n“Citizen,” retorted Gavroche, “I haven’t called you ‘bourgeois’ yet.\nWhy do you insult me?”\n\n\n“Where are you going, you rogue?”\n\n\n“Monsieur,” retorted Gavroche, “perhaps you were a man of wit\nyesterday, but you have degenerated this morning.”\n\n\n“I ask you where are you going, you villain?”\n\n\nGavroche replied:—\n\n“You speak prettily. Really, no one would suppose you as old as you\nare. You ought to sell all your hair at a hundred francs apiece. That\nwould yield you five hundred francs.”\n\n\n“Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going,\nbandit?”\n\n\nGavroche retorted again:—\n\n“What villainous words! You must wipe your mouth better the first time\nthat they give you suck.”\n\n\nThe sergeant lowered his bayonet.\n\n“Will you tell me where you are going, you wretch?”\n\n\n“General,” said Gavroche “I’m on my way to look for a doctor for my\nwife who is in labor.”\n\n\n“To arms!” shouted the sergeant.\n\nThe master-stroke of strong men consists in saving themselves by the\nvery means that have ruined them; Gavroche took in the whole situation\nat a glance. It was the cart which had told against him, it was the\ncart’s place to protect him.\n\nAt the moment when the sergeant was on the point of making his descent\non Gavroche, the cart, converted into a projectile and launched with\nall the latter’s might, rolled down upon him furiously, and the\nsergeant, struck full in the stomach, tumbled over backwards into the\ngutter while his gun went off in the air.\n\nThe men of the post had rushed out pell-mell at the sergeant’s shout;\nthe shot brought on a general random discharge, after which they\nreloaded their weapons and began again.\n\nThis blind-man’s-buff musketry lasted for a quarter of an hour and\nkilled several panes of glass.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Gavroche, who had retraced his steps at full speed,\nhalted five or six streets distant and seated himself, panting, on the\nstone post which forms the corner of the Enfants-Rouges.\n\nHe listened.\n\nAfter panting for a few minutes, he turned in the direction where the\nfusillade was raging, lifted his left hand to a level with his nose and\nthrust it forward three times, as he slapped the back of his head with\nhis right hand; an imperious gesture in which Parisian street-urchindom\nhas condensed French irony, and which is evidently efficacious, since\nit has already lasted half a century.\n\nThis gayety was troubled by one bitter reflection.\n\n“Yes,” said he, “I’m splitting with laughter, I’m twisting with\ndelight, I abound in joy, but I’m losing my way, I shall have to take a\nroundabout way. If I only reach the barricade in season!”\n\n\nThereupon he set out again on a run.\n\nAnd as he ran:—\n\n“Ah, by the way, where was I?” said he.\n\nAnd he resumed his ditty, as he plunged rapidly through the streets,\nand this is what died away in the gloom:—\n\n“Mais il reste encore des bastilles,\nEt je vais mettre le holà\nDans l’ordre public que voilà.\nOù vont les belles filles,\nLon la.\n\n“Quelqu’un veut-il jouer aux quilles?\nTout l’ancien monde s‘écroula\nQuand la grosse boule roula.\nOù vont les belles filles,\nLon la.\n\n“Vieux bon peuple, à coups de béquilles,\nCassons ce Louvre où s‘étala\nLa monarchie en falbala.\nOù vont les belles filles,\nLon la.\n\n“Nous en avons forcé les grilles,\nLe roi Charles-Dix ce jour-là,\nTenait mal et se décolla.\nOù vont les belles filles,\nLon la.\"57\n\n\nThe post’s recourse to arms was not without result. The cart was\nconquered, the drunken man was taken prisoner. The first was put in the\npound, the second was later on somewhat harassed before the councils of\nwar as an accomplice. The public ministry of the day proved its\nindefatigable zeal in the defence of society, in this instance.\n\nGavroche’s adventure, which has lingered as a tradition in the quarters\nof the Temple, is one of the most terrible souvenirs of the elderly\nbourgeois of the Marais, and is entitled in their memories: “The\nnocturnal attack by the post of the Royal Printing Establishment.”\n\n\n[THE END OF VOLUME IV “SAINT DENIS”]\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME V—JEAN VALJEAN\n\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nFrontispiece Volume Five\n\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nTitlepage Volume Five\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIRST—THE WAR BETWEEN FOUR WALLS\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE CHARYBDIS OF THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE AND THE SCYLLA OF\nTHE FAUBOURG DU TEMPLE\n\n\nThe two most memorable barricades which the observer of social maladies\ncan name do not belong to the period in which the action of this work\nis laid. These two barricades, both of them symbols, under two\ndifferent aspects, of a redoubtable situation, sprang from the earth at\nthe time of the fatal insurrection of June, 1848, the greatest war of\nthe streets that history has ever beheld.\n\nIt sometimes happens that, even contrary to principles, even contrary\nto liberty, equality, and fraternity, even contrary to the universal\nvote, even contrary to the government, by all for all, from the depths\nof its anguish, of its discouragements and its destitutions, of its\nfevers, of its distresses, of its miasmas, of its ignorances, of its\ndarkness, that great and despairing body, the rabble, protests against,\nand that the populace wages battle against, the people.\n\nBeggars attack the common right; the ochlocracy rises against demos.\n\nThese are melancholy days; for there is always a certain amount of\nnight even in this madness, there is suicide in this duel, and those\nwords which are intended to be insults—beggars, canaille, ochlocracy,\npopulace—exhibit, alas! rather the fault of those who reign than the\nfault of those who suffer; rather the fault of the privileged than the\nfault of the disinherited.\n\nFor our own part, we never pronounce those words without pain and\nwithout respect, for when philosophy fathoms the facts to which they\ncorrespond, it often finds many a grandeur beside these miseries.\nAthens was an ochlocracy; the beggars were the making of Holland; the\npopulace saved Rome more than once; and the rabble followed Jesus\nChrist.\n\nThere is no thinker who has not at times contemplated the magnificences\nof the lower classes.\n\nIt was of this rabble that Saint Jerome was thinking, no doubt, and of\nall these poor people and all these vagabonds and all these miserable\npeople whence sprang the apostles and the martyrs, when he uttered this\nmysterious saying: _“Fex urbis, lex orbis,”_—the dregs of the city, the\nlaw of the earth.\n\nThe exasperations of this crowd which suffers and bleeds, its violences\ncontrary to all sense, directed against the principles which are its\nlife, its masterful deeds against the right, are its popular _coups\nd‘état_ and should be repressed. The man of probity sacrifices himself,\nand out of his very love for this crowd, he combats it. But how\nexcusable he feels it even while holding out against it! How he\nvenerates it even while resisting it! This is one of those rare moments\nwhen, while doing that which it is one’s duty to do, one feels\nsomething which disconcerts one, and which would dissuade one from\nproceeding further; one persists, it is necessary, but conscience,\nthough satisfied, is sad, and the accomplishment of duty is complicated\nwith a pain at the heart.\n\nJune, 1848, let us hasten to say, was an exceptional fact, and almost\nimpossible of classification, in the philosophy of history. All the\nwords which we have just uttered, must be discarded, when it becomes a\nquestion of this extraordinary revolt, in which one feels the holy\nanxiety of toil claiming its rights. It was necessary to combat it, and\nthis was a duty, for it attacked the republic. But what was June, 1848,\nat bottom? A revolt of the people against itself.\n\nWhere the subject is not lost sight of, there is no digression; may we,\nthen, be permitted to arrest the reader’s attention for a moment on the\ntwo absolutely unique barricades of which we have just spoken and which\ncharacterized this insurrection.\n\nOne blocked the entrance to the Faubourg Saint Antoine; the other\ndefended the approach to the Faubourg du Temple; those before whom\nthese two fearful masterpieces of civil war reared themselves beneath\nthe brilliant blue sky of June, will never forget them.\n\nThe Saint-Antoine barricade was tremendous; it was three stories high,\nand seven hundred feet wide. It barred the vast opening of the\nfaubourg, that is to say, three streets, from angle to angle; ravined,\njagged, cut up, divided, crenelated, with an immense rent, buttressed\nwith piles that were bastions in themselves throwing out capes here and\nthere, powerfully backed up by two great promontories of houses of the\nfaubourg, it reared itself like a cyclopean dike at the end of the\nformidable place which had seen the 14th of July. Nineteen barricades\nwere ranged, one behind the other, in the depths of the streets behind\nthis principal barricade. At the very sight of it, one felt the\nagonizing suffering in the immense faubourg, which had reached that\npoint of extremity when a distress may become a catastrophe. Of what\nwas that barricade made? Of the ruins of three six-story houses\ndemolished expressly, said some. Of the prodigy of all wraths, said\nothers. It wore the lamentable aspect of all constructions of hatred,\nruin. It might be asked: Who built this? It might also be said: Who\ndestroyed this? It was the improvisation of the ebullition. Hold! take\nthis door! this grating! this penthouse! this chimney-piece! this\nbroken brazier! this cracked pot! Give all! cast away all! Push this\nroll, dig, dismantle, overturn, ruin everything! It was the\ncollaboration of the pavement, the block of stone, the beam, the bar of\niron, the rag, the scrap, the broken pane, the unseated chair, the\ncabbage-stalk, the tatter, the rag, and the malediction. It was grand\nand it was petty. It was the abyss parodied on the public place by\nhubbub. The mass beside the atom; the strip of ruined wall and the\nbroken bowl,—threatening fraternization of every sort of rubbish.\nSisyphus had thrown his rock there and Job his potsherd. Terrible, in\nshort. It was the acropolis of the barefooted. Overturned carts broke\nthe uniformity of the slope; an immense dray was spread out there\ncrossways, its axle pointing heavenward, and seemed a scar on that\ntumultuous façade; an omnibus hoisted gayly, by main force, to the very\nsummit of the heap, as though the architects of this bit of savagery\nhad wished to add a touch of the street urchin humor to their terror,\npresented its horseless, unharnessed pole to no one knows what horses\nof the air. This gigantic heap, the alluvium of the revolt, figured to\nthe mind an Ossa on Pelion of all revolutions; ’93 on ’89, the 9th of\nThermidor on the 10th of August, the 18th of Brumaire on the 11th of\nJanuary, Vendemiaire on Prairial, 1848 on 1830. The situation deserved\nthe trouble and this barricade was worthy to figure on the very spot\nwhence the Bastille had disappeared. If the ocean made dikes, it is\nthus that it would build. The fury of the flood was stamped upon this\nshapeless mass. What flood? The crowd. One thought one beheld hubbub\npetrified. One thought one heard humming above this barricade as though\nthere had been over their hive, enormous, dark bees of violent\nprogress. Was it a thicket? Was it a bacchanalia? Was it a fortress?\nVertigo seemed to have constructed it with blows of its wings. There\nwas something of the cesspool in that redoubt and something Olympian in\nthat confusion. One there beheld in a pell-mell full of despair, the\nrafters of roofs, bits of garret windows with their figured paper,\nwindow sashes with their glass planted there in the ruins awaiting the\ncannon, wrecks of chimneys, cupboards, tables, benches, howling\ntopsyturveydom, and those thousand poverty-stricken things, the very\nrefuse of the mendicant, which contain at the same time fury and\nnothingness. One would have said that it was the tatters of a people,\nrags of wood, of iron, of bronze, of stone, and that the Faubourg Saint\nAntoine had thrust it there at its door, with a colossal flourish of\nthe broom making of its misery its barricade. Blocks resembling\nheadsman’s blocks, dislocated chains, pieces of woodwork with brackets\nhaving the form of gibbets, horizontal wheels projecting from the\nrubbish, amalgamated with this edifice of anarchy the sombre figure of\nthe old tortures endured by the people. The barricade Saint Antoine\nconverted everything into a weapon; everything that civil war could\nthrow at the head of society proceeded thence; it was not combat, it\nwas a paroxysm; the carbines which defended this redoubt, among which\nthere were some blunderbusses, sent bits of earthenware bones,\ncoat-buttons, even the casters from night-stands, dangerous projectiles\non account of the brass. This barricade was furious; it hurled to the\nclouds an inexpressible clamor; at certain moments, when provoking the\narmy, it was covered with throngs and tempest; a tumultuous crowd of\nflaming heads crowned it; a swarm filled it; it had a thorny crest of\nguns, of sabres, of cudgels, of axes, of pikes and of bayonets; a vast\nred flag flapped in the wind; shouts of command, songs of attack, the\nroll of drums, the sobs of women and bursts of gloomy laughter from the\nstarving were to be heard there. It was huge and living, and, like the\nback of an electric beast, there proceeded from it little flashes of\nlightning. The spirit of revolution covered with its cloud this summit\nwhere rumbled that voice of the people which resembles the voice of\nGod; a strange majesty was emitted by this titanic basket of rubbish.\nIt was a heap of filth and it was Sinai.\n\nAs we have said previously, it attacked in the name of the\nrevolution—what? The revolution. It—that barricade, chance, hazard,\ndisorder, terror, misunderstanding, the unknown—had facing it the\nConstituent Assembly, the sovereignty of the people, universal\nsuffrage, the nation, the republic; and it was the Carmagnole bidding\ndefiance to the Marseillaise.\n\nImmense but heroic defiance, for the old faubourg is a hero.\n\nThe faubourg and its redoubt lent each other assistance. The faubourg\nshouldered the redoubt, the redoubt took its stand under cover of the\nfaubourg. The vast barricade spread out like a cliff against which the\nstrategy of the African generals dashed itself. Its caverns, its\nexcrescences, its warts, its gibbosities, grimaced, so to speak, and\ngrinned beneath the smoke. The mitraille vanished in shapelessness; the\nbombs plunged into it; bullets only succeeded in making holes in it;\nwhat was the use of cannonading chaos? and the regiments, accustomed to\nthe fiercest visions of war, gazed with uneasy eyes on that species of\nredoubt, a wild beast in its boar-like bristling and a mountain by its\nenormous size.\n\nA quarter of a league away, from the corner of the Rue du Temple which\ndebouches on the boulevard near the Château-d’Eau, if one thrust one’s\nhead bodily beyond the point formed by the front of the Dallemagne\nshop, one perceived in the distance, beyond the canal, in the street\nwhich mounts the slopes of Belleville at the culminating point of the\nrise, a strange wall reaching to the second story of the house fronts,\na sort of hyphen between the houses on the right and the houses on the\nleft, as though the street had folded back on itself its loftiest wall\nin order to close itself abruptly. This wall was built of\npaving-stones. It was straight, correct, cold, perpendicular, levelled\nwith the square, laid out by rule and line. Cement was lacking, of\ncourse, but, as in the case of certain Roman walls, without interfering\nwith its rigid architecture. The entablature was mathematically\nparallel with the base. From distance to distance, one could\ndistinguish on the gray surface, almost invisible loopholes which\nresembled black threads. These loopholes were separated from each other\nby equal spaces. The street was deserted as far as the eye could reach.\nAll windows and doors were closed. In the background rose this barrier,\nwhich made a blind thoroughfare of the street, a motionless and\ntranquil wall; no one was visible, nothing was audible; not a cry, not\na sound, not a breath. A sepulchre.\n\nThe dazzling sun of June inundated this terrible thing with light.\n\nIt was the barricade of the Faubourg of the Temple.\n\nAs soon as one arrived on the spot, and caught sight of it, it was\nimpossible, even for the boldest, not to become thoughtful before this\nmysterious apparition. It was adjusted, jointed, imbricated,\nrectilinear, symmetrical and funereal. Science and gloom met there. One\nfelt that the chief of this barricade was a geometrician or a spectre.\nOne looked at it and spoke low.\n\nFrom time to time, if some soldier, an officer or representative of the\npeople, chanced to traverse the deserted highway, a faint, sharp\nwhistle was heard, and the passer-by fell dead or wounded, or, if he\nescaped the bullet, sometimes a biscaïen was seen to ensconce itself in\nsome closed shutter, in the interstice between two blocks of stone, or\nin the plaster of a wall. For the men in the barricade had made\nthemselves two small cannons out of two cast-iron lengths of gas-pipe,\nplugged up at one end with tow and fire-clay. There was no waste of\nuseless powder. Nearly every shot told. There were corpses here and\nthere, and pools of blood on the pavement. I remember a white butterfly\nwhich went and came in the street. Summer does not abdicate.\n\nIn the neighborhood, the spaces beneath the portes-cochères were\nencumbered with wounded.\n\nOne felt oneself aimed at by some person whom one did not see, and one\nunderstood that guns were levelled at the whole length of the street.\n\nMassed behind the sort of sloping ridge which the vaulted canal forms\nat the entrance to the Faubourg du Temple, the soldiers of the\nattacking column, gravely and thoughtfully, watched this dismal\nredoubt, this immobility, this passivity, whence sprang death. Some\ncrawled flat on their faces as far as the crest of the curve of the\nbridge, taking care that their shakos did not project beyond it.\n\nThe valiant Colonel Monteynard admired this barricade with a\nshudder.—“How that is built!” he said to a Representative. “Not one\npaving-stone projects beyond its neighbor. It is made of porcelain.”—At\nthat moment, a bullet broke the cross on his breast, and he fell.\n\n“The cowards!” people said. “Let them show themselves. Let us see them!\nThey dare not! They are hiding!”\n\n\nThe barricade of the Faubourg du Temple, defended by eighty men,\nattacked by ten thousand, held out for three days. On the fourth, they\ndid as at Zaatcha, as at Constantine, they pierced the houses, they\ncame over the roofs, the barricade was taken. Not one of the eighty\ncowards thought of flight, all were killed there with the exception of\nthe leader, Barthélemy, of whom we shall speak presently.\n\nThe Saint-Antoine barricade was the tumult of thunders; the barricade\nof the Temple was silence. The difference between these two redoubts\nwas the difference between the formidable and the sinister. One seemed\na maw; the other a mask.\n\nAdmitting that the gigantic and gloomy insurrection of June was\ncomposed of a wrath and of an enigma, one divined in the first\nbarricade the dragon, and behind the second the sphinx.\n\nThese two fortresses had been erected by two men named, the one,\nCournet, the other, Barthélemy. Cournet made the Saint-Antoine\nbarricade; Barthélemy the barricade of the Temple. Each was the image\nof the man who had built it.\n\nCournet was a man of lofty stature; he had broad shoulders, a red face,\na crushing fist, a bold heart, a loyal soul, a sincere and terrible\neye. Intrepid, energetic, irascible, stormy; the most cordial of men,\nthe most formidable of combatants. War, strife, conflict, were the very\nair he breathed and put him in a good humor. He had been an officer in\nthe navy, and, from his gestures and his voice, one divined that he\nsprang from the ocean, and that he came from the tempest; he carried\nthe hurricane on into battle. With the exception of the genius, there\nwas in Cournet something of Danton, as, with the exception of the\ndivinity, there was in Danton something of Hercules.\n\nBarthélemy, thin, feeble, pale, taciturn, was a sort of tragic street\nurchin, who, having had his ears boxed by a policeman, lay in wait for\nhim, and killed him, and at seventeen was sent to the galleys. He came\nout and made this barricade.\n\nLater on, fatal circumstance, in London, proscribed by all, Barthélemy\nslew Cournet. It was a funereal duel. Some time afterwards, caught in\nthe gearing of one of those mysterious adventures in which passion\nplays a part, a catastrophe in which French justice sees extenuating\ncircumstances, and in which English justice sees only death, Barthélemy\nwas hanged. The sombre social construction is so made that, thanks to\nmaterial destitution, thanks to moral obscurity, that unhappy being who\npossessed an intelligence, certainly firm, possibly great, began in\nFrance with the galleys, and ended in England with the gallows.\nBarthélemy, on occasion, flew but one flag, the black flag.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—WHAT IS TO BE DONE IN THE ABYSS IF ONE DOES NOT CONVERSE\n\n\nSixteen years count in the subterranean education of insurrection, and\nJune, 1848, knew a great deal more about it than June, 1832. So the\nbarricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie was only an outline, and an\nembryo compared to the two colossal barricades which we have just\nsketched; but it was formidable for that epoch.\n\nThe insurgents under the eye of Enjolras, for Marius no longer looked\nafter anything, had made good use of the night. The barricade had been\nnot only repaired, but augmented. They had raised it two feet. Bars of\niron planted in the pavement resembled lances in rest. All sorts of\nrubbish brought and added from all directions complicated the external\nconfusion. The redoubt had been cleverly made over, into a wall on the\ninside and a thicket on the outside.\n\nThe staircase of paving-stones which permitted one to mount it like the\nwall of a citadel had been reconstructed.\n\nThe barricade had been put in order, the tap-room disencumbered, the\nkitchen appropriated for the ambulance, the dressing of the wounded\ncompleted, the powder scattered on the ground and on the tables had\nbeen gathered up, bullets run, cartridges manufactured, lint scraped,\nthe fallen weapons re-distributed, the interior of the redoubt cleaned,\nthe rubbish swept up, corpses removed.\n\nThey laid the dead in a heap in the Mondétour lane, of which they were\nstill the masters. The pavement was red for a long time at that spot.\nAmong the dead there were four National Guardsmen of the suburbs.\nEnjolras had their uniforms laid aside.\n\nEnjolras had advised two hours of sleep. Advice from Enjolras was a\ncommand. Still, only three or four took advantage of it.\n\nFeuilly employed these two hours in engraving this inscription on the\nwall which faced the tavern:—\n\nLONG LIVE THE PEOPLES!\n\nThese four words, hollowed out in the rough stone with a nail, could be\nstill read on the wall in 1848.\n\nThe three women had profited by the respite of the night to vanish\ndefinitely; which allowed the insurgents to breathe more freely.\n\nThey had found means of taking refuge in some neighboring house.\n\nThe greater part of the wounded were able, and wished, to fight still.\nOn a litter of mattresses and trusses of straw in the kitchen, which\nhad been converted into an ambulance, there were five men gravely\nwounded, two of whom were municipal guardsmen. The municipal guardsmen\nwere attended to first.\n\nIn the tap-room there remained only Mabeuf under his black cloth and\nJavert bound to his post.\n\n“This is the hall of the dead,” said Enjolras.\n\nIn the interior of this hall, barely lighted by a candle at one end,\nthe mortuary table being behind the post like a horizontal bar, a sort\nof vast, vague cross resulted from Javert erect and Mabeuf lying prone.\n\nThe pole of the omnibus, although snapped off by the fusillade, was\nstill sufficiently upright to admit of their fastening the flag to it.\n\nEnjolras, who possessed that quality of a leader, of always doing what\nhe said, attached to this staff the bullet-ridden and bloody coat of\nthe old man’s.\n\nNo repast had been possible. There was neither bread nor meat. The\nfifty men in the barricade had speedily exhausted the scanty provisions\nof the wine-shop during the sixteen hours which they had passed there.\nAt a given moment, every barricade inevitably becomes the raft of _la\nMéduse_. They were obliged to resign themselves to hunger. They had\nthen reached the first hours of that Spartan day of the 6th of June\nwhen, in the barricade Saint-Merry, Jeanne, surrounded by the\ninsurgents who demanded bread, replied to all combatants crying:\n“Something to eat!” with: “Why? It is three o’clock; at four we shall\nbe dead.”\n\n\nAs they could no longer eat, Enjolras forbade them to drink. He\ninterdicted wine, and portioned out the brandy.\n\nThey had found in the cellar fifteen full bottles hermetically sealed.\nEnjolras and Combeferre examined them. Combeferre when he came up again\nsaid:—“It’s the old stock of Father Hucheloup, who began business as a\ngrocer.”—“It must be real wine,” observed Bossuet. “It’s lucky that\nGrantaire is asleep. If he were on foot, there would be a good deal of\ndifficulty in saving those bottles.”—Enjolras, in spite of all murmurs,\nplaced his veto on the fifteen bottles, and, in order that no one might\ntouch them, he had them placed under the table on which Father Mabeuf\nwas lying.\n\nAbout two o’clock in the morning, they reckoned up their strength.\nThere were still thirty-seven of them.\n\nThe day began to dawn. The torch, which had been replaced in its cavity\nin the pavement, had just been extinguished. The interior of the\nbarricade, that species of tiny courtyard appropriated from the street,\nwas bathed in shadows, and resembled, athwart the vague, twilight\nhorror, the deck of a disabled ship. The combatants, as they went and\ncame, moved about there like black forms. Above that terrible\nnesting-place of gloom the stories of the mute houses were lividly\noutlined; at the very top, the chimneys stood palely out. The sky was\nof that charming, undecided hue, which may be white and may be blue.\nBirds flew about in it with cries of joy. The lofty house which formed\nthe back of the barricade, being turned to the East, had upon its roof\na rosy reflection. The morning breeze ruffled the gray hair on the head\nof the dead man at the third-story window.\n\n“I am delighted that the torch has been extinguished,” said Courfeyrac\nto Feuilly. “That torch flickering in the wind annoyed me. It had the\nappearance of being afraid. The light of torches resembles the wisdom\nof cowards; it gives a bad light because it trembles.”\n\n\nDawn awakens minds as it does the birds; all began to talk.\n\nJoly, perceiving a cat prowling on a gutter, extracted philosophy from\nit.\n\n“What is the cat?” he exclaimed. “It is a corrective. The good God,\nhaving made the mouse, said: ‘Hullo! I have committed a blunder.’ And\nso he made the cat. The cat is the erratum of the mouse. The mouse,\nplus the cat, is the proof of creation revised and corrected.”\n\n\nCombeferre, surrounded by students and artisans, was speaking of the\ndead, of Jean Prouvaire, of Bahorel, of Mabeuf, and even of Cabuc, and\nof Enjolras’ sad severity. He said:—\n\n“Harmodius and Aristogiton, Brutus, Chereas, Stephanus, Cromwell,\nCharlotte Corday, Sand, have all had their moment of agony when it was\ntoo late. Our hearts quiver so, and human life is such a mystery that,\neven in the case of a civic murder, even in a murder for liberation, if\nthere be such a thing, the remorse for having struck a man surpasses\nthe joy of having served the human race.”\n\n\nAnd, such are the windings of the exchange of speech, that, a moment\nlater, by a transition brought about through Jean Prouvaire’s verses,\nCombeferre was comparing the translators of the Georgics, Raux with\nCournand, Cournand with Delille, pointing out the passages translated\nby Malfilâtre, particularly the prodigies of Cæsar’s death; and at that\nword, Cæsar, the conversation reverted to Brutus.\n\n“Cæsar,” said Combeferre, “fell justly. Cicero was severe towards\nCæsar, and he was right. That severity is not diatribe. When Zoïlus\ninsults Homer, when Mævius insults Virgil, when Visé insults Molière,\nwhen Pope insults Shakspeare, when Frederic insults Voltaire, it is an\nold law of envy and hatred which is being carried out; genius attracts\ninsult, great men are always more or less barked at. But Zoïlus and\nCicero are two different persons. Cicero is an arbiter in thought, just\nas Brutus is an arbiter by the sword. For my own part, I blame that\nlast justice, the blade; but, antiquity admitted it. Cæsar, the\nviolator of the Rubicon, conferring, as though they came from him, the\ndignities which emanated from the people, not rising at the entrance of\nthe senate, committed the acts of a king and almost of a tyrant, _regia\nac pene tyrannica_. He was a great man; so much the worse, or so much\nthe better; the lesson is but the more exalted. His twenty-three wounds\ntouch me less than the spitting in the face of Jesus Christ. Cæsar is\nstabbed by the senators; Christ is cuffed by lackeys. One feels the God\nthrough the greater outrage.”\n\n\nBossuet, who towered above the interlocutors from the summit of a heap\nof paving-stones, exclaimed, rifle in hand:—\n\n“Oh Cydathenæum, Oh Myrrhinus, Oh Probalinthus, Oh graces of the\nÆantides! Oh! Who will grant me to pronounce the verses of Homer like a\nGreek of Laurium or of Edapteon?”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—LIGHT AND SHADOW\n\n\nEnjolras had been to make a reconnaissance. He had made his way out\nthrough Mondétour lane, gliding along close to the houses.\n\nThe insurgents, we will remark, were full of hope. The manner in which\nthey had repulsed the attack of the preceding night had caused them to\nalmost disdain in advance the attack at dawn. They waited for it with a\nsmile. They had no more doubt as to their success than as to their\ncause. Moreover, succor was, evidently, on the way to them. They\nreckoned on it. With that facility of triumphant prophecy which is one\nof the sources of strength in the French combatant, they divided the\nday which was at hand into three distinct phases. At six o’clock in the\nmorning a regiment “which had been labored with,” would turn; at noon,\nthe insurrection of all Paris; at sunset, revolution.\n\nThey heard the alarm bell of Saint-Merry, which had not been silent for\nan instant since the night before; a proof that the other barricade,\nthe great one, Jeanne’s, still held out.\n\nAll these hopes were exchanged between the different groups in a sort\nof gay and formidable whisper which resembled the warlike hum of a hive\nof bees.\n\nEnjolras reappeared. He returned from his sombre eagle flight into\nouter darkness. He listened for a moment to all this joy with folded\narms, and one hand on his mouth. Then, fresh and rosy in the growing\nwhiteness of the dawn, he said:\n\n“The whole army of Paris is to strike. A third of the army is bearing\ndown upon the barricades in which you now are. There is the National\nGuard in addition. I have picked out the shakos of the fifth of the\nline, and the standard-bearers of the sixth legion. In one hour you\nwill be attacked. As for the populace, it was seething yesterday,\nto-day it is not stirring. There is nothing to expect; nothing to hope\nfor. Neither from a faubourg nor from a regiment. You are abandoned.”\n\n\nThese words fell upon the buzzing of the groups, and produced on them\nthe effect caused on a swarm of bees by the first drops of a storm. A\nmoment of indescribable silence ensued, in which death might have been\nheard flitting by.\n\nThis moment was brief.\n\nA voice from the obscurest depths of the groups shouted to Enjolras:\n\n“So be it. Let us raise the barricade to a height of twenty feet, and\nlet us all remain in it. Citizens, let us offer the protests of\ncorpses. Let us show that, if the people abandon the republicans, the\nrepublicans do not abandon the people.”\n\n\nThese words freed the thought of all from the painful cloud of\nindividual anxieties. It was hailed with an enthusiastic acclamation.\n\nNo one ever has known the name of the man who spoke thus; he was some\nunknown blouse-wearer, a stranger, a man forgotten, a passing hero,\nthat great anonymous, always mingled in human crises and in social\ngeneses who, at a given moment, utters in a supreme fashion the\ndecisive word, and who vanishes into the shadows after having\nrepresented for a minute, in a lightning flash, the people and God.\n\nThis inexorable resolution so thoroughly impregnated the air of the 6th\nof June, 1832, that, almost at the very same hour, on the barricade\nSaint-Merry, the insurgents were raising that clamor which has become a\nmatter of history and which has been consigned to the documents in the\ncase:—“What matters it whether they come to our assistance or not? Let\nus get ourselves killed here, to the very last man.”\n\n\nAs the reader sees, the two barricades, though materially isolated,\nwere in communication with each other.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—MINUS FIVE, PLUS ONE\n\n\nAfter the man who decreed the “protest of corpses” had spoken, and had\ngiven this formula of their common soul, there issued from all mouths a\nstrangely satisfied and terrible cry, funereal in sense and triumphant\nin tone:\n\n“Long live death! Let us all remain here!”\n\n\n“Why all?” said Enjolras.\n\n“All! All!”\n\n\nEnjolras resumed:\n\n“The position is good; the barricade is fine. Thirty men are enough.\nWhy sacrifice forty?”\n\n\nThey replied:\n\n“Because not one will go away.”\n\n\n“Citizens,” cried Enjolras, and there was an almost irritated vibration\nin his voice, “this republic is not rich enough in men to indulge in\nuseless expenditure of them. Vain-glory is waste. If the duty of some\nis to depart, that duty should be fulfilled like any other.”\n\n\nEnjolras, the man-principle, had over his co-religionists that sort of\nomnipotent power which emanates from the absolute. Still, great as was\nthis omnipotence, a murmur arose. A leader to the very finger-tips,\nEnjolras, seeing that they murmured, insisted. He resumed haughtily:\n\n“Let those who are afraid of not numbering more than thirty say so.”\n\n\nThe murmurs redoubled.\n\n“Besides,” observed a voice in one group, “it is easy enough to talk\nabout leaving. The barricade is hemmed in.”\n\n\n“Not on the side of the Halles,” said Enjolras. “The Rue Mondétour is\nfree, and through the Rue des Prêcheurs one can reach the Marché des\nInnocents.”\n\n\n“And there,” went on another voice, “you would be captured. You would\nfall in with some grand guard of the line or the suburbs; they will spy\na man passing in blouse and cap. ‘Whence come you?’ ‘Don’t you belong\nto the barricade?’ And they will look at your hands. You smell of\npowder. Shot.”\n\n\nEnjolras, without making any reply, touched Combeferre’s shoulder, and\nthe two entered the tap-room.\n\nThey emerged thence a moment later. Enjolras held in his outstretched\nhands the four uniforms which he had laid aside. Combeferre followed,\ncarrying the shoulder-belts and the shakos.\n\n“With this uniform,” said Enjolras, “you can mingle with the ranks and\nescape; here is enough for four.” And he flung on the ground, deprived\nof its pavement, the four uniforms.\n\nNo wavering took place in his stoical audience. Combeferre took the\nword.\n\n“Come,” said he, “you must have a little pity. Do you know what the\nquestion is here? It is a question of women. See here. Are there women\nor are there not? Are there children or are there not? Are there\nmothers, yes or no, who rock cradles with their foot and who have a lot\nof little ones around them? Let that man of you who has never beheld a\nnurse’s breast raise his hand. Ah! you want to get yourselves killed,\nso do I—I, who am speaking to you; but I do not want to feel the\nphantoms of women wreathing their arms around me. Die, if you will, but\ndon’t make others die. Suicides like that which is on the brink of\naccomplishment here are sublime; but suicide is narrow, and does not\nadmit of extension; and as soon as it touches your neighbors, suicide\nis murder. Think of the little blond heads; think of the white locks.\nListen, Enjolras has just told me that he saw at the corner of the Rue\ndu Cygne a lighted casement, a candle in a poor window, on the fifth\nfloor, and on the pane the quivering shadow of the head of an old\nwoman, who had the air of having spent the night in watching. Perhaps\nshe is the mother of some one of you. Well, let that man go, and make\nhaste, to say to his mother: ‘Here I am, mother!’ Let him feel at ease,\nthe task here will be performed all the same. When one supports one’s\nrelatives by one’s toil, one has not the right to sacrifice one’s self.\nThat is deserting one’s family. And those who have daughters! what are\nyou thinking of? You get yourselves killed, you are dead, that is well.\nAnd tomorrow? Young girls without bread—that is a terrible thing. Man\nbegs, woman sells. Ah! those charming and gracious beings, so gracious\nand so sweet, who have bonnets of flowers, who fill the house with\npurity, who sing and prattle, who are like a living perfume, who prove\nthe existence of angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth,\nthat Jeanne, that Lise, that Mimi, those adorable and honest creatures\nwho are your blessings and your pride, ah! good God, they will suffer\nhunger! What do you want me to say to you? There is a market for human\nflesh; and it is not with your shadowy hands, shuddering around them,\nthat you will prevent them from entering it! Think of the street, think\nof the pavement covered with passers-by, think of the shops past which\nwomen go and come with necks all bare, and through the mire. These\nwomen, too, were pure once. Think of your sisters, those of you who\nhave them. Misery, prostitution, the police, Saint-Lazare—that is what\nthose beautiful, delicate girls, those fragile marvels of modesty,\ngentleness and loveliness, fresher than lilacs in the month of May,\nwill come to. Ah! you have got yourselves killed! You are no longer on\nhand! That is well; you have wished to release the people from Royalty,\nand you deliver over your daughters to the police. Friends, have a\ncare, have mercy. Women, unhappy women, we are not in the habit of\nbestowing much thought on them. We trust to the women not having\nreceived a man’s education, we prevent their reading, we prevent their\nthinking, we prevent their occupying themselves with politics; will you\nprevent them from going to the dead-house this evening, and recognizing\nyour bodies? Let us see, those who have families must be tractable, and\nshake hands with us and take themselves off, and leave us here alone to\nattend to this affair. I know well that courage is required to leave,\nthat it is hard; but the harder it is, the more meritorious. You say:\n‘I have a gun, I am at the barricade; so much the worse, I shall remain\nthere.’ So much the worse is easily said. My friends, there is a\nmorrow; you will not be here to-morrow, but your families will; and\nwhat sufferings! See, here is a pretty, healthy child, with cheeks like\nan apple, who babbles, prattles, chatters, who laughs, who smells sweet\nbeneath your kiss,—and do you know what becomes of him when he is\nabandoned? I have seen one, a very small creature, no taller than that.\nHis father was dead. Poor people had taken him in out of charity, but\nthey had bread only for themselves. The child was always hungry. It was\nwinter. He did not cry. You could see him approach the stove, in which\nthere was never any fire, and whose pipe, you know, was of mastic and\nyellow clay. His breathing was hoarse, his face livid, his limbs\nflaccid, his belly prominent. He said nothing. If you spoke to him, he\ndid not answer. He is dead. He was taken to the Necker Hospital, where\nI saw him. I was house-surgeon in that hospital. Now, if there are any\nfathers among you, fathers whose happiness it is to stroll on Sundays\nholding their child’s tiny hand in their robust hand, let each one of\nthose fathers imagine that this child is his own. That poor brat, I\nremember, and I seem to see him now, when he lay nude on the dissecting\ntable, how his ribs stood out on his skin like the graves beneath the\ngrass in a cemetery. A sort of mud was found in his stomach. There were\nashes in his teeth. Come, let us examine ourselves conscientiously and\ntake counsel with our heart. Statistics show that the mortality among\nabandoned children is fifty-five per cent. I repeat, it is a question\nof women, it concerns mothers, it concerns young girls, it concerns\nlittle children. Who is talking to you of yourselves? We know well what\nyou are; we know well that you are all brave, parbleu! we know well\nthat you all have in your souls the joy and the glory of giving your\nlife for the great cause; we know well that you feel yourselves elected\nto die usefully and magnificently, and that each one of you clings to\nhis share in the triumph. Very well. But you are not alone in this\nworld. There are other beings of whom you must think. You must not be\negoists.”\n\n\nAll dropped their heads with a gloomy air.\n\nStrange contradictions of the human heart at its most sublime moments.\nCombeferre, who spoke thus, was not an orphan. He recalled the mothers\nof other men, and forgot his own. He was about to get himself killed.\nHe was “an egoist.”\n\n\nMarius, fasting, fevered, having emerged in succession from all hope,\nand having been stranded in grief, the most sombre of shipwrecks, and\nsaturated with violent emotions and conscious that the end was near,\nhad plunged deeper and deeper into that visionary stupor which always\nprecedes the fatal hour voluntarily accepted.\n\nA physiologist might have studied in him the growing symptoms of that\nfebrile absorption known to, and classified by, science, and which is\nto suffering what voluptuousness is to pleasure. Despair, also, has its\necstasy. Marius had reached this point. He looked on at everything as\nfrom without; as we have said, things which passed before him seemed\nfar away; he made out the whole, but did not perceive the details. He\nbeheld men going and coming as through a flame. He heard voices\nspeaking as at the bottom of an abyss.\n\nBut this moved him. There was in this scene a point which pierced and\nroused even him. He had but one idea now, to die; and he did not wish\nto be turned aside from it, but he reflected, in his gloomy\nsomnambulism, that while destroying himself, he was not prohibited from\nsaving some one else.\n\nHe raised his voice.\n\n“Enjolras and Combeferre are right,” said he; “no unnecessary\nsacrifice. I join them, and you must make haste. Combeferre has said\nconvincing things to you. There are some among you who have families,\nmothers, sisters, wives, children. Let such leave the ranks.”\n\n\nNo one stirred.\n\n“Married men and the supporters of families, step out of the ranks!”\nrepeated Marius.\n\nHis authority was great. Enjolras was certainly the head of the\nbarricade, but Marius was its savior.\n\n“I order it,” cried Enjolras.\n\n“I entreat you,” said Marius.\n\nThen, touched by Combeferre’s words, shaken by Enjolras’ order, touched\nby Marius’ entreaty, these heroic men began to denounce each other.—“It\nis true,” said one young man to a full grown man, “you are the father\nof a family. Go.”—“It is your duty rather,” retorted the man, “you have\ntwo sisters whom you maintain.”—And an unprecedented controversy broke\nforth. Each struggled to determine which should not allow himself to be\nplaced at the door of the tomb.\n\n“Make haste,” said Courfeyrac, “in another quarter of an hour it will\nbe too late.”\n\n\n“Citizens,” pursued Enjolras, “this is the Republic, and universal\nsuffrage reigns. Do you yourselves designate those who are to go.”\n\n\nThey obeyed. After the expiration of a few minutes, five were\nunanimously selected and stepped out of the ranks.\n\n“There are five of them!” exclaimed Marius.\n\nThere were only four uniforms.\n\n“Well,” began the five, “one must stay behind.”\n\n\nAnd then a struggle arose as to who should remain, and who should find\nreasons for the others not remaining. The generous quarrel began\nafresh.\n\n“You have a wife who loves you.”—“You have your aged mother.”—” You\nhave neither father nor mother, and what is to become of your three\nlittle brothers?”—“You are the father of five children.”—“You have a\nright to live, you are only seventeen, it is too early for you to die.”\n\n\nThese great revolutionary barricades were assembling points for\nheroism. The improbable was simple there. These men did not astonish\neach other.\n\n“Be quick,” repeated Courfeyrac.\n\nMen shouted to Marius from the groups:\n\n“Do you designate who is to remain.”\n\n\n“Yes,” said the five, “choose. We will obey you.”\n\n\nMarius did not believe that he was capable of another emotion. Still,\nat this idea, that of choosing a man for death, his blood rushed back\nto his heart. He would have turned pale, had it been possible for him\nto become any paler.\n\nHe advanced towards the five, who smiled upon him, and each, with his\neyes full of that grand flame which one beholds in the depths of\nhistory hovering over Thermopylæ, cried to him:\n\n“Me! me! me!”\n\n\nAnd Marius stupidly counted them; there were still five of them! Then\nhis glance dropped to the four uniforms.\n\nAt that moment, a fifth uniform fell, as if from heaven, upon the other\nfour.\n\nThe fifth man was saved.\n\nMarius raised his eyes and recognized M. Fauchelevent.\n\nJean Valjean had just entered the barricade.\n\nHe had arrived by way of Mondétour lane, whither by dint of inquiries\nmade, or by instinct, or chance. Thanks to his dress of a National\nGuardsman, he had made his way without difficulty.\n\nThe sentinel stationed by the insurgents in the Rue Mondétour had no\noccasion to give the alarm for a single National Guardsman, and he had\nallowed the latter to entangle himself in the street, saying to\nhimself: “Probably it is a reinforcement, in any case it is a\nprisoner.” The moment was too grave to admit of the sentinel abandoning\nhis duty and his post of observation.\n\nAt the moment when Jean Valjean entered the redoubt, no one had noticed\nhim, all eyes being fixed on the five chosen men and the four uniforms.\nJean Valjean also had seen and heard, and he had silently removed his\ncoat and flung it on the pile with the rest.\n\nThe emotion aroused was indescribable.\n\n“Who is this man?” demanded Bossuet.\n\n“He is a man who saves others,” replied Combeferre.\n\nMarius added in a grave voice:\n\n“I know him.”\n\n\nThis guarantee satisfied every one.\n\nEnjolras turned to Jean Valjean.\n\n“Welcome, citizen.”\n\n\nAnd he added:\n\n“You know that we are about to die.”\n\n\nJean Valjean, without replying, helped the insurgent whom he was saving\nto don his uniform.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—THE HORIZON WHICH ONE BEHOLDS FROM THE SUMMIT OF A BARRICADE\n\n\nThe situation of all in that fatal hour and that pitiless place, had as\nresult and culminating point Enjolras’ supreme melancholy.\n\nEnjolras bore within him the plenitude of the revolution; he was\nincomplete, however, so far as the absolute can be so; he had too much\nof Saint-Just about him, and not enough of Anacharsis Cloots; still,\nhis mind, in the society of the Friends of the A B C, had ended by\nundergoing a certain polarization from Combeferre’s ideas; for some\ntime past, he had been gradually emerging from the narrow form of\ndogma, and had allowed himself to incline to the broadening influence\nof progress, and he had come to accept, as a definitive and magnificent\nevolution, the transformation of the great French Republic, into the\nimmense human republic. As far as the immediate means were concerned, a\nviolent situation being given, he wished to be violent; on that point,\nhe never varied; and he remained of that epic and redoubtable school\nwhich is summed up in the words: “Eighty-three.” Enjolras was standing\nerect on the staircase of paving-stones, one elbow resting on the stock\nof his gun. He was engaged in thought; he quivered, as at the passage\nof prophetic breaths; places where death is have these effects of\ntripods. A sort of stifled fire darted from his eyes, which were filled\nwith an inward look. All at once he threw back his head, his blond\nlocks fell back like those of an angel on the sombre quadriga made of\nstars, they were like the mane of a startled lion in the flaming of an\nhalo, and Enjolras cried:\n\n“Citizens, do you picture the future to yourselves? The streets of\ncities inundated with light, green branches on the thresholds, nations\nsisters, men just, old men blessing children, the past loving the\npresent, thinkers entirely at liberty, believers on terms of full\nequality, for religion heaven, God the direct priest, human conscience\nbecome an altar, no more hatreds, the fraternity of the workshop and\nthe school, for sole penalty and recompense fame, work for all, right\nfor all, peace over all, no more bloodshed, no more wars, happy\nmothers! To conquer matter is the first step; to realize the ideal is\nthe second. Reflect on what progress has already accomplished.\nFormerly, the first human races beheld with terror the hydra pass\nbefore their eyes, breathing on the waters, the dragon which vomited\nflame, the griffin who was the monster of the air, and who flew with\nthe wings of an eagle and the talons of a tiger; fearful beasts which\nwere above man. Man, nevertheless, spread his snares, consecrated by\nintelligence, and finally conquered these monsters. We have vanquished\nthe hydra, and it is called the locomotive; we are on the point of\nvanquishing the griffin, we already grasp it, and it is called the\nballoon. On the day when this Promethean task shall be accomplished,\nand when man shall have definitely harnessed to his will the triple\nChimæra of antiquity, the hydra, the dragon and the griffin, he will be\nthe master of water, fire, and of air, and he will be for the rest of\nanimated creation that which the ancient gods formerly were to him.\nCourage, and onward! Citizens, whither are we going? To science made\ngovernment, to the force of things become the sole public force, to the\nnatural law, having in itself its sanction and its penalty and\npromulgating itself by evidence, to a dawn of truth corresponding to a\ndawn of day. We are advancing to the union of peoples; we are advancing\nto the unity of man. No more fictions; no more parasites. The real\ngoverned by the true, that is the goal. Civilization will hold its\nassizes at the summit of Europe, and, later on, at the centre of\ncontinents, in a grand parliament of the intelligence. Something\nsimilar has already been seen. The amphictyons had two sittings a year,\none at Delphos the seat of the gods, the other at Thermopylæ, the place\nof heroes. Europe will have her amphictyons; the globe will have its\namphictyons. France bears this sublime future in her breast. This is\nthe gestation of the nineteenth century. That which Greece sketched out\nis worthy of being finished by France. Listen to me, you, Feuilly,\nvaliant artisan, man of the people. I revere you. Yes, you clearly\nbehold the future, yes, you are right. You had neither father nor\nmother, Feuilly; you adopted humanity for your mother and right for\nyour father. You are about to die, that is to say to triumph, here.\nCitizens, whatever happens to-day, through our defeat as well as\nthrough our victory, it is a revolution that we are about to create. As\nconflagrations light up a whole city, so revolutions illuminate the\nwhole human race. And what is the revolution that we shall cause? I\nhave just told you, the Revolution of the True. From a political point\nof view, there is but a single principle; the sovereignty of man over\nhimself. This sovereignty of myself over myself is called Liberty.\nWhere two or three of these sovereignties are combined, the state\nbegins. But in that association there is no abdication. Each\nsovereignty concedes a certain quantity of itself, for the purpose of\nforming the common right. This quantity is the same for all of us. This\nidentity of concession which each makes to all, is called Equality.\nCommon right is nothing else than the protection of all beaming on the\nright of each. This protection of all over each is called Fraternity.\nThe point of intersection of all these assembled sovereignties is\ncalled society. This intersection being a junction, this point is a\nknot. Hence what is called the social bond. Some say social contract;\nwhich is the same thing, the word contract being etymologically formed\nwith the idea of a bond. Let us come to an understanding about\nequality; for, if liberty is the summit, equality is the base.\nEquality, citizens, is not wholly a surface vegetation, a society of\ngreat blades of grass and tiny oaks; a proximity of jealousies which\nrender each other null and void; legally speaking, it is all aptitudes\npossessed of the same opportunity; politically, it is all votes\npossessed of the same weight; religiously, it is all consciences\npossessed of the same right. Equality has an organ: gratuitous and\nobligatory instruction. The right to the alphabet, that is where the\nbeginning must be made. The primary school imposed on all, the\nsecondary school offered to all, that is the law. From an identical\nschool, an identical society will spring. Yes, instruction! light!\nlight! everything comes from light, and to it everything returns.\nCitizens, the nineteenth century is great, but the twentieth century\nwill be happy. Then, there will be nothing more like the history of\nold, we shall no longer, as to-day, have to fear a conquest, an\ninvasion, a usurpation, a rivalry of nations, arms in hand, an\ninterruption of civilization depending on a marriage of kings, on a\nbirth in hereditary tyrannies, a partition of peoples by a congress, a\ndismemberment because of the failure of a dynasty, a combat of two\nreligions meeting face to face, like two bucks in the dark, on the\nbridge of the infinite; we shall no longer have to fear famine, farming\nout, prostitution arising from distress, misery from the failure of\nwork and the scaffold and the sword, and battles and the ruffianism of\nchance in the forest of events. One might almost say: There will be no\nmore events. We shall be happy. The human race will accomplish its law,\nas the terrestrial globe accomplishes its law; harmony will be\nre-established between the soul and the star; the soul will gravitate\naround the truth, as the planet around the light. Friends, the present\nhour in which I am addressing you, is a gloomy hour; but these are\nterrible purchases of the future. A revolution is a toll. Oh! the human\nrace will be delivered, raised up, consoled! We affirm it on this\nbarrier. Whence should proceed that cry of love, if not from the\nheights of sacrifice? Oh my brothers, this is the point of junction, of\nthose who think and of those who suffer; this barricade is not made of\npaving-stones, nor of joists, nor of bits of iron; it is made of two\nheaps, a heap of ideas, and a heap of woes. Here misery meets the\nideal. The day embraces the night, and says to it: ‘I am about to die,\nand thou shalt be born again with me.’ From the embrace of all\ndesolations faith leaps forth. Sufferings bring hither their agony and\nideas their immortality. This agony and this immortality are about to\njoin and constitute our death. Brothers, he who dies here dies in the\nradiance of the future, and we are entering a tomb all flooded with the\ndawn.”\n\n\nEnjolras paused rather than became silent; his lips continued to move\nsilently, as though he were talking to himself, which caused them all\nto gaze attentively at him, in the endeavor to hear more. There was no\napplause; but they whispered together for a long time. Speech being a\nbreath, the rustling of intelligences resembles the rustling of leaves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—MARIUS HAGGARD, JAVERT LACONIC\n\n\nLet us narrate what was passing in Marius’ thoughts.\n\nLet the reader recall the state of his soul. We have just recalled it,\neverything was a vision to him now. His judgment was disturbed. Marius,\nlet us insist on this point, was under the shadow of the great, dark\nwings which are spread over those in the death agony. He felt that he\nhad entered the tomb, it seemed to him that he was already on the other\nside of the wall, and he no longer beheld the faces of the living\nexcept with the eyes of one dead.\n\nHow did M. Fauchelevent come there? Why was he there? What had he come\nthere to do? Marius did not address all these questions to himself.\nBesides, since our despair has this peculiarity, that it envelops\nothers as well as ourselves, it seemed logical to him that all the\nworld should come thither to die.\n\nOnly, he thought of Cosette with a pang at his heart.\n\nHowever, M. Fauchelevent did not speak to him, did not look at him, and\nhad not even the air of hearing him, when Marius raised his voice to\nsay: “I know him.”\n\n\nAs far as Marius was concerned, this attitude of M. Fauchelevent was\ncomforting, and, if such a word can be used for such impressions, we\nshould say that it pleased him. He had always felt the absolute\nimpossibility of addressing that enigmatical man, who was, in his eyes,\nboth equivocal and imposing. Moreover, it had been a long time since he\nhad seen him; and this still further augmented the impossibility for\nMarius’ timid and reserved nature.\n\nThe five chosen men left the barricade by way of Mondétour lane; they\nbore a perfect resemblance to members of the National Guard. One of\nthem wept as he took his leave. Before setting out, they embraced those\nwho remained.\n\nWhen the five men sent back to life had taken their departure, Enjolras\nthought of the man who had been condemned to death.\n\nHe entered the tap-room. Javert, still bound to the post, was engaged\nin meditation.\n\n“Do you want anything?” Enjolras asked him.\n\nJavert replied: “When are you going to kill me?”\n\n\n“Wait. We need all our cartridges just at present.”\n\n\n“Then give me a drink,” said Javert.\n\nEnjolras himself offered him a glass of water, and, as Javert was\npinioned, he helped him to drink.\n\n“Is that all?” inquired Enjolras.\n\n“I am uncomfortable against this post,” replied Javert. “You are not\ntender to have left me to pass the night here. Bind me as you please,\nbut you surely might lay me out on a table like that other man.”\n\n\nAnd with a motion of the head, he indicated the body of M. Mabeuf.\n\nThere was, as the reader will remember, a long, broad table at the end\nof the room, on which they had been running bullets and making\ncartridges. All the cartridges having been made, and all the powder\nused, this table was free.\n\nAt Enjolras’ command, four insurgents unbound Javert from the post.\nWhile they were loosing him, a fifth held a bayonet against his breast.\n\nLeaving his arms tied behind his back, they placed about his feet a\nslender but stout whip-cord, as is done to men on the point of mounting\nthe scaffold, which allowed him to take steps about fifteen inches in\nlength, and made him walk to the table at the end of the room, where\nthey laid him down, closely bound about the middle of the body.\n\nBy way of further security, and by means of a rope fastened to his\nneck, they added to the system of ligatures which rendered every\nattempt at escape impossible, that sort of bond which is called in\nprisons a martingale, which, starting at the neck, forks on the\nstomach, and meets the hands, after passing between the legs.\n\nWhile they were binding Javert, a man standing on the threshold was\nsurveying him with singular attention. The shadow cast by this man made\nJavert turn his head. He raised his eyes, and recognized Jean Valjean.\nHe did not even start, but dropped his lids proudly and confined\nhimself to the remark: “It is perfectly simple.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—THE SITUATION BECOMES AGGRAVATED\n\n\nThe daylight was increasing rapidly. Not a window was opened, not a\ndoor stood ajar; it was the dawn but not the awaking. The end of the\nRue de la Chanvrerie, opposite the barricade, had been evacuated by the\ntroops, as we have stated, it seemed to be free, and presented itself\nto passers-by with a sinister tranquillity. The Rue Saint-Denis was as\ndumb as the avenue of Sphinxes at Thebes. Not a living being in the\ncrossroads, which gleamed white in the light of the sun. Nothing is so\nmournful as this light in deserted streets. Nothing was to be seen, but\nthere was something to be heard. A mysterious movement was going on at\na certain distance. It was evident that the critical moment was\napproaching. As on the previous evening, the sentinels had come in; but\nthis time all had come.\n\nThe barricade was stronger than on the occasion of the first attack.\nSince the departure of the five, they had increased its height still\nfurther.\n\nOn the advice of the sentinel who had examined the region of the\nHalles, Enjolras, for fear of a surprise in the rear, came to a serious\ndecision. He had the small gut of the Mondétour lane, which had been\nleft open up to that time, barricaded. For this purpose, they tore up\nthe pavement for the length of several houses more. In this manner, the\nbarricade, walled on three streets, in front on the Rue de la\nChanvrerie, to the left on the Rues du Cygne and de la Petite\nTruanderie, to the right on the Rue Mondétour, was really almost\nimpregnable; it is true that they were fatally hemmed in there. It had\nthree fronts, but no exit.—“A fortress but a rat hole too,” said\nCourfeyrac with a laugh.\n\nEnjolras had about thirty paving-stones “torn up in excess,” said\nBossuet, piled up near the door of the wine-shop.\n\nThe silence was now so profound in the quarter whence the attack must\nneeds come, that Enjolras had each man resume his post of battle.\n\nAn allowance of brandy was doled out to each.\n\nNothing is more curious than a barricade preparing for an assault. Each\nman selects his place as though at the theatre. They jostle, and elbow\nand crowd each other. There are some who make stalls of paving-stones.\nHere is a corner of the wall which is in the way, it is removed; here\nis a redan which may afford protection, they take shelter behind it.\nLeft-handed men are precious; they take the places that are\ninconvenient to the rest. Many arrange to fight in a sitting posture.\nThey wish to be at ease to kill, and to die comfortably. In the sad war\nof June, 1848, an insurgent who was a formidable marksman, and who was\nfiring from the top of a terrace upon a roof, had a reclining-chair\nbrought there for his use; a charge of grape-shot found him out there.\n\nAs soon as the leader has given the order to clear the decks for\naction, all disorderly movements cease; there is no more pulling from\none another; there are no more coteries; no more asides, there is no\nmore holding aloof; everything in their spirits converges in, and\nchanges into, a waiting for the assailants. A barricade before the\narrival of danger is chaos; in danger, it is discipline itself. Peril\nproduces order.\n\nAs soon as Enjolras had seized his double-barrelled rifle, and had\nplaced himself in a sort of embrasure which he had reserved for\nhimself, all the rest held their peace. A series of faint, sharp noises\nresounded confusedly along the wall of paving-stones. It was the men\ncocking their guns.\n\nMoreover, their attitudes were prouder, more confident than ever; the\nexcess of sacrifice strengthens; they no longer cherished any hope, but\nthey had despair, despair,—the last weapon, which sometimes gives\nvictory; Virgil has said so. Supreme resources spring from extreme\nresolutions. To embark in death is sometimes the means of escaping a\nshipwreck; and the lid of the coffin becomes a plank of safety.\n\nAs on the preceding evening, the attention of all was directed, we\nmight almost say leaned upon, the end of the street, now lighted up and\nvisible.\n\nThey had not long to wait. A stir began distinctly in the Saint-Leu\nquarter, but it did not resemble the movement of the first attack. A\nclashing of chains, the uneasy jolting of a mass, the click of brass\nskipping along the pavement, a sort of solemn uproar, announced that\nsome sinister construction of iron was approaching. There arose a\ntremor in the bosoms of these peaceful old streets, pierced and built\nfor the fertile circulation of interests and ideas, and which are not\nmade for the horrible rumble of the wheels of war.\n\nThe fixity of eye in all the combatants upon the extremity of the\nstreet became ferocious.\n\nA cannon made its appearance.\n\nArtillery-men were pushing the piece; it was in firing trim; the\nfore-carriage had been detached; two upheld the gun-carriage, four were\nat the wheels; others followed with the caisson. They could see the\nsmoke of the burning lint-stock.\n\n“Fire!” shouted Enjolras.\n\nThe whole barricade fired, the report was terrible; an avalanche of\nsmoke covered and effaced both cannon and men; after a few seconds, the\ncloud dispersed, and the cannon and men reappeared; the gun-crew had\njust finished rolling it slowly, correctly, without haste, into\nposition facing the barricade. Not one of them had been struck. Then\nthe captain of the piece, bearing down upon the breech in order to\nraise the muzzle, began to point the cannon with the gravity of an\nastronomer levelling a telescope.\n\n“Bravo for the cannoneers!” cried Bossuet.\n\nAnd the whole barricade clapped their hands.\n\nA moment later, squarely planted in the very middle of the street,\nastride of the gutter, the piece was ready for action. A formidable\npair of jaws yawned on the barricade.\n\n“Come, merrily now!” ejaculated Courfeyrac. “That’s the brutal part of\nit. After the fillip on the nose, the blow from the fist. The army is\nreaching out its big paw to us. The barricade is going to be severely\nshaken up. The fusillade tries, the cannon takes.”\n\n\n“It is a piece of eight, new model, brass,” added Combeferre. “Those\npieces are liable to burst as soon as the proportion of ten parts of\ntin to one hundred of brass is exceeded. The excess of tin renders them\ntoo tender. Then it comes to pass that they have caves and chambers\nwhen looked at from the vent hole. In order to obviate this danger, and\nto render it possible to force the charge, it may become necessary to\nreturn to the process of the fourteenth century, hooping, and to\nencircle the piece on the outside with a series of unwelded steel\nbands, from the breech to the trunnions. In the meantime, they remedy\nthis defect as best they may; they manage to discover where the holes\nare located in the vent of a cannon, by means of a searcher. But there\nis a better method, with Gribeauval’s movable star.”\n\n\n“In the sixteenth century,” remarked Bossuet, “they used to rifle\ncannon.”\n\n\n“Yes,” replied Combeferre, “that augments the projectile force, but\ndiminishes the accuracy of the firing. In firing at short range, the\ntrajectory is not as rigid as could be desired, the parabola is\nexaggerated, the line of the projectile is no longer sufficiently\nrectilinear to allow of its striking intervening objects, which is,\nnevertheless, a necessity of battle, the importance of which increases\nwith the proximity of the enemy and the precipitation of the discharge.\nThis defect of the tension of the curve of the projectile in the rifled\ncannon of the sixteenth century arose from the smallness of the charge;\nsmall charges for that sort of engine are imposed by the ballistic\nnecessities, such, for instance, as the preservation of the\ngun-carriage. In short, that despot, the cannon, cannot do all that it\ndesires; force is a great weakness. A cannon-ball only travels six\nhundred leagues an hour; light travels seventy thousand leagues a\nsecond. Such is the superiority of Jesus Christ over Napoleon.”\n\n\n“Reload your guns,” said Enjolras.\n\nHow was the casing of the barricade going to behave under the\ncannon-balls? Would they effect a breach? That was the question. While\nthe insurgents were reloading their guns, the artillery-men were\nloading the cannon.\n\nThe anxiety in the redoubt was profound.\n\nThe shot sped the report burst forth.\n\n“Present!” shouted a joyous voice.\n\nAnd Gavroche flung himself into the barricade just as the ball dashed\nagainst it.\n\nHe came from the direction of the Rue du Cygne, and he had nimbly\nclimbed over the auxiliary barricade which fronted on the labyrinth of\nthe Rue de la Petite Truanderie.\n\nGavroche produced a greater sensation in the barricade than the\ncannon-ball.\n\nThe ball buried itself in the mass of rubbish. At the most there was an\nomnibus wheel broken, and the old Anceau cart was demolished. On seeing\nthis, the barricade burst into a laugh.\n\n“Go on!” shouted Bossuet to the artillerists.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—THE ARTILLERY-MEN COMPEL PEOPLE TO TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY\n\n\nThey flocked round Gavroche. But he had no time to tell anything.\nMarius drew him aside with a shudder.\n\n“What are you doing here?”\n\n\n“Hullo!” said the child, “what are you doing here yourself?”\n\n\nAnd he stared at Marius intently with his epic effrontery. His eyes\ngrew larger with the proud light within them.\n\nIt was with an accent of severity that Marius continued:\n\n“Who told you to come back? Did you deliver my letter at the address?”\n\n\nGavroche was not without some compunctions in the matter of that\nletter. In his haste to return to the barricade, he had got rid of it\nrather than delivered it. He was forced to acknowledge to himself that\nhe had confided it rather lightly to that stranger whose face he had\nnot been able to make out. It is true that the man was bareheaded, but\nthat was not sufficient. In short, he had been administering to himself\nlittle inward remonstrances and he feared Marius’ reproaches. In order\nto extricate himself from the predicament, he took the simplest course;\nhe lied abominably.\n\n“Citizen, I delivered the letter to the porter. The lady was asleep.\nShe will have the letter when she wakes up.”\n\n\nMarius had had two objects in sending that letter: to bid farewell to\nCosette and to save Gavroche. He was obliged to content himself with\nthe half of his desire.\n\nThe despatch of his letter and the presence of M. Fauchelevent in the\nbarricade, was a coincidence which occurred to him. He pointed out M.\nFauchelevent to Gavroche.\n\n“Do you know that man?”\n\n\n“No,” said Gavroche.\n\nGavroche had, in fact, as we have just mentioned, seen Jean Valjean\nonly at night.\n\nThe troubled and unhealthy conjectures which had outlined themselves in\nMarius’ mind were dissipated. Did he know M. Fauchelevent’s opinions?\nPerhaps M. Fauchelevent was a republican. Hence his very natural\npresence in this combat.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Gavroche was shouting, at the other end of the\nbarricade: “My gun!”\n\n\nCourfeyrac had it returned to him.\n\nGavroche warned “his comrades” as he called them, that the barricade\nwas blocked. He had had great difficulty in reaching it. A battalion of\nthe line whose arms were piled in the Rue de la Petite Truanderie was\non the watch on the side of the Rue du Cygne; on the opposite side, the\nmunicipal guard occupied the Rue des Prêcheurs. The bulk of the army\nwas facing them in front.\n\nThis information given, Gavroche added:\n\n“I authorize you to hit ‘em a tremendous whack.”\n\n\nMeanwhile, Enjolras was straining his ears and watching at his\nembrasure.\n\nThe assailants, dissatisfied, no doubt, with their shot, had not\nrepeated it.\n\nA company of infantry of the line had come up and occupied the end of\nthe street behind the piece of ordnance. The soldiers were tearing up\nthe pavement and constructing with the stones a small, low wall, a sort\nof side-work not more than eighteen inches high, and facing the\nbarricade. In the angle at the left of this epaulement, there was\nvisible the head of the column of a battalion from the suburbs massed\nin the Rue Saint-Denis.\n\nEnjolras, on the watch, thought he distinguished the peculiar sound\nwhich is produced when the shells of grape-shot are drawn from the\ncaissons, and he saw the commander of the piece change the elevation\nand incline the mouth of the cannon slightly to the left. Then the\ncannoneers began to load the piece. The chief seized the lint-stock\nhimself and lowered it to the vent.\n\n“Down with your heads, hug the wall!” shouted Enjolras, “and all on\nyour knees along the barricade!”\n\n\nThe insurgents who were straggling in front of the wine-shop, and who\nhad quitted their posts of combat on Gavroche’s arrival, rushed\npell-mell towards the barricade; but before Enjolras’ order could be\nexecuted, the discharge took place with the terrifying rattle of a\nround of grape-shot. This is what it was, in fact.\n\nThe charge had been aimed at the cut in the redoubt, and had there\nrebounded from the wall; and this terrible rebound had produced two\ndead and three wounded.\n\nIf this were continued, the barricade was no longer tenable. The\ngrape-shot made its way in.\n\nA murmur of consternation arose.\n\n“Let us prevent the second discharge,” said Enjolras.\n\nAnd, lowering his rifle, he took aim at the captain of the gun, who, at\nthat moment, was bearing down on the breach of his gun and rectifying\nand definitely fixing its pointing.\n\nThe captain of the piece was a handsome sergeant of artillery, very\nyoung, blond, with a very gentle face, and the intelligent air peculiar\nto that predestined and redoubtable weapon which, by dint of perfecting\nitself in horror, must end in killing war.\n\nCombeferre, who was standing beside Enjolras, scrutinized this young\nman.\n\n“What a pity!” said Combeferre. “What hideous things these butcheries\nare! Come, when there are no more kings, there will be no more war.\nEnjolras, you are taking aim at that sergeant, you are not looking at\nhim. Fancy, he is a charming young man; he is intrepid; it is evident\nthat he is thoughtful; those young artillery-men are very well\neducated; he has a father, a mother, a family; he is probably in love;\nhe is not more than five and twenty at the most; he might be your\nbrother.”\n\n\n“He is,” said Enjolras.\n\n“Yes,” replied Combeferre, “he is mine too. Well, let us not kill him.”\n\n\n“Let me alone. It must be done.”\n\n\nAnd a tear trickled slowly down Enjolras’ marble cheek.\n\nAt the same moment, he pressed the trigger of his rifle. The flame\nleaped forth. The artillery-man turned round twice, his arms extended\nin front of him, his head uplifted, as though for breath, then he fell\nwith his side on the gun, and lay there motionless. They could see his\nback, from the centre of which there flowed directly a stream of blood.\nThe ball had traversed his breast from side to side. He was dead.\n\nHe had to be carried away and replaced by another. Several minutes were\nthus gained, in fact.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—EMPLOYMENT OF THE OLD TALENTS OF A POACHER AND THAT\nINFALLIBLE MARKSMANSHIP WHICH INFLUENCED THE CONDEMNATION OF 1796\n\n\nOpinions were exchanged in the barricade. The firing from the gun was\nabout to begin again. Against that grape-shot, they could not hold out\na quarter of an hour longer. It was absolutely necessary to deaden the\nblows.\n\nEnjolras issued this command:\n\n“We must place a mattress there.”\n\n\n“We have none,” said Combeferre, “the wounded are lying on them.”\n\n\nJean Valjean, who was seated apart on a stone post, at the corner of\nthe tavern, with his gun between his knees, had, up to that moment,\ntaken no part in anything that was going on. He did not appear to hear\nthe combatants saying around him: “Here is a gun that is doing\nnothing.”\n\n\nAt the order issued by Enjolras, he rose.\n\nIt will be remembered that, on the arrival of the rabble in the Rue de\nla Chanvrerie, an old woman, foreseeing the bullets, had placed her\nmattress in front of her window. This window, an attic window, was on\nthe roof of a six-story house situated a little beyond the barricade.\nThe mattress, placed cross-wise, supported at the bottom on two poles\nfor drying linen, was upheld at the top by two ropes, which, at that\ndistance, looked like two threads, and which were attached to two nails\nplanted in the window frames. These ropes were distinctly visible, like\nhairs, against the sky.\n\n“Can some one lend me a double-barrelled rifle?” said Jean Valjean.\n\nEnjolras, who had just re-loaded his, handed it to him.\n\nJean Valjean took aim at the attic window and fired.\n\nOne of the mattress ropes was cut.\n\nThe mattress now hung by one thread only.\n\nJean Valjean fired the second charge. The second rope lashed the panes\nof the attic window. The mattress slipped between the two poles and\nfell into the street.\n\nThe barricade applauded.\n\nAll voices cried:\n\n“Here is a mattress!”\n\n\n“Yes,” said Combeferre, “but who will go and fetch it?”\n\n\nThe mattress had, in fact, fallen outside the barricade, between\nbesiegers and besieged. Now, the death of the sergeant of artillery\nhaving exasperated the troop, the soldiers had, for several minutes,\nbeen lying flat on their stomachs behind the line of paving-stones\nwhich they had erected, and, in order to supply the forced silence of\nthe piece, which was quiet while its service was in course of\nreorganization, they had opened fire on the barricade. The insurgents\ndid not reply to this musketry, in order to spare their ammunition. The\nfusillade broke against the barricade; but the street, which it filled,\nwas terrible.\n\nJean Valjean stepped out of the cut, entered the street, traversed the\nstorm of bullets, walked up to the mattress, hoisted it upon his back,\nand returned to the barricade.\n\nHe placed the mattress in the cut with his own hands. He fixed it there\nagainst the wall in such a manner that the artillery-men should not see\nit.\n\nThat done, they awaited the next discharge of grape-shot.\n\nIt was not long in coming.\n\nThe cannon vomited forth its package of buckshot with a roar. But there\nwas no rebound. The effect which they had foreseen had been attained.\nThe barricade was saved.\n\n“Citizen,” said Enjolras to Jean Valjean, “the Republic thanks you.”\n\n\nBossuet admired and laughed. He exclaimed:\n\n“It is immoral that a mattress should have so much power. Triumph of\nthat which yields over that which strikes with lightning. But never\nmind, glory to the mattress which annuls a cannon!”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X—DAWN\n\n\nAt that moment, Cosette awoke.\n\nHer chamber was narrow, neat, unobtrusive, with a long sash-window,\nfacing the East on the back court-yard of the house.\n\nCosette knew nothing of what was going on in Paris. She had not been\nthere on the preceding evening, and she had already retired to her\nchamber when Toussaint had said:\n\n“It appears that there is a row.”\n\n\nCosette had slept only a few hours, but soundly. She had had sweet\ndreams, which possibly arose from the fact that her little bed was very\nwhite. Some one, who was Marius, had appeared to her in the light. She\nawoke with the sun in her eyes, which, at first, produced on her the\neffect of being a continuation of her dream. Her first thought on\nemerging from this dream was a smiling one. Cosette felt herself\nthoroughly reassured. Like Jean Valjean, she had, a few hours\npreviously, passed through that reaction of the soul which absolutely\nwill not hear of unhappiness. She began to cherish hope, with all her\nmight, without knowing why. Then she felt a pang at her heart. It was\nthree days since she had seen Marius. But she said to herself that he\nmust have received her letter, that he knew where she was, and that he\nwas so clever that he would find means of reaching her.—And that\ncertainly to-day, and perhaps that very morning.—It was broad daylight,\nbut the rays of light were very horizontal; she thought that it was\nvery early, but that she must rise, nevertheless, in order to receive\nMarius.\n\nShe felt that she could not live without Marius, and that,\nconsequently, that was sufficient and that Marius would come. No\nobjection was valid. All this was certain. It was monstrous enough\nalready to have suffered for three days. Marius absent three days, this\nwas horrible on the part of the good God. Now, this cruel teasing from\non high had been gone through with. Marius was about to arrive, and he\nwould bring good news. Youth is made thus; it quickly dries its eyes;\nit finds sorrow useless and does not accept it. Youth is the smile of\nthe future in the presence of an unknown quantity, which is itself. It\nis natural to it to be happy. It seems as though its respiration were\nmade of hope.\n\nMoreover, Cosette could not remember what Marius had said to her on the\nsubject of this absence which was to last only one day, and what\nexplanation of it he had given her. Every one has noticed with what\nnimbleness a coin which one has dropped on the ground rolls away and\nhides, and with what art it renders itself undiscoverable. There are\nthoughts which play us the same trick; they nestle away in a corner of\nour brain; that is the end of them; they are lost; it is impossible to\nlay the memory on them. Cosette was somewhat vexed at the useless\nlittle effort made by her memory. She told herself, that it was very\nnaughty and very wicked of her, to have forgotten the words uttered by\nMarius.\n\nShe sprang out of bed and accomplished the two ablutions of soul and\nbody, her prayers and her toilet.\n\nOne may, in a case of exigency, introduce the reader into a nuptial\nchamber, not into a virginal chamber. Verse would hardly venture it,\nprose must not.\n\nIt is the interior of a flower that is not yet unfolded, it is\nwhiteness in the dark, it is the private cell of a closed lily, which\nmust not be gazed upon by man so long as the sun has not gazed upon it.\nWoman in the bud is sacred. That innocent bud which opens, that\nadorable half-nudity which is afraid of itself, that white foot which\ntakes refuge in a slipper, that throat which veils itself before a\nmirror as though a mirror were an eye, that chemise which makes haste\nto rise up and conceal the shoulder for a creaking bit of furniture or\na passing vehicle, those cords tied, those clasps fastened, those laces\ndrawn, those tremors, those shivers of cold and modesty, that exquisite\naffright in every movement, that almost winged uneasiness where there\nis no cause for alarm, the successive phases of dressing, as charming\nas the clouds of dawn,—it is not fitting that all this should be\nnarrated, and it is too much to have even called attention to it.\n\nThe eye of man must be more religious in the presence of the rising of\na young girl than in the presence of the rising of a star. The\npossibility of hurting should inspire an augmentation of respect. The\ndown on the peach, the bloom on the plum, the radiated crystal of the\nsnow, the wing of the butterfly powdered with feathers, are coarse\ncompared to that chastity which does not even know that it is chaste.\nThe young girl is only the flash of a dream, and is not yet a statue.\nHer bed-chamber is hidden in the sombre part of the ideal. The\nindiscreet touch of a glance brutalizes this vague penumbra. Here,\ncontemplation is profanation.\n\nWe shall, therefore, show nothing of that sweet little flutter of\nCosette’s rising.\n\nAn oriental tale relates how the rose was made white by God, but that\nAdam looked upon her when she was unfolding, and she was ashamed and\nturned crimson. We are of the number who fall speechless in the\npresence of young girls and flowers, since we think them worthy of\nveneration.\n\nCosette dressed herself very hastily, combed and dressed her hair,\nwhich was a very simple matter in those days, when women did not swell\nout their curls and bands with cushions and puffs, and did not put\ncrinoline in their locks. Then she opened the window and cast her eyes\naround her in every direction, hoping to descry some bit of the street,\nan angle of the house, an edge of pavement, so that she might be able\nto watch for Marius there. But no view of the outside was to be had.\nThe back court was surrounded by tolerably high walls, and the outlook\nwas only on several gardens. Cosette pronounced these gardens hideous:\nfor the first time in her life, she found flowers ugly. The smallest\nscrap of the gutter of the street would have met her wishes better. She\ndecided to gaze at the sky, as though she thought that Marius might\ncome from that quarter.\n\nAll at once, she burst into tears. Not that this was fickleness of\nsoul; but hopes cut in twain by dejection—that was her case. She had a\nconfused consciousness of something horrible. Thoughts were rife in the\nair, in fact. She told herself that she was not sure of anything, that\nto withdraw herself from sight was to be lost; and the idea that Marius\ncould return to her from heaven appeared to her no longer charming but\nmournful.\n\nThen, as is the nature of these clouds, calm returned to her, and hope\nand a sort of unconscious smile, which yet indicated trust in God.\n\nEvery one in the house was still asleep. A country-like silence\nreigned. Not a shutter had been opened. The porter’s lodge was closed.\nToussaint had not risen, and Cosette, naturally, thought that her\nfather was asleep. She must have suffered much, and she must have still\nbeen suffering greatly, for she said to herself, that her father had\nbeen unkind; but she counted on Marius. The eclipse of such a light was\ndecidedly impossible. Now and then, she heard sharp shocks in the\ndistance, and she said: “It is odd that people should be opening and\nshutting their carriage gates so early.” They were the reports of the\ncannon battering the barricade.\n\nA few feet below Cosette’s window, in the ancient and perfectly black\ncornice of the wall, there was a martin’s nest; the curve of this nest\nformed a little projection beyond the cornice, so that from above it\nwas possible to look into this little paradise. The mother was there,\nspreading her wings like a fan over her brood; the father fluttered\nabout, flew away, then came back, bearing in his beak food and kisses.\nThe dawning day gilded this happy thing, the great law, “Multiply,” lay\nthere smiling and august, and that sweet mystery unfolded in the glory\nof the morning. Cosette, with her hair in the sunlight, her soul\nabsorbed in chimæras, illuminated by love within and by the dawn\nwithout, bent over mechanically, and almost without daring to avow to\nherself that she was thinking at the same time of Marius, began to gaze\nat these birds, at this family, at that male and female, that mother\nand her little ones, with the profound trouble which a nest produces on\na virgin.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI—THE SHOT WHICH MISSES NOTHING AND KILLS NO ONE\n\n\nThe assailants’ fire continued. Musketry and grape-shot alternated, but\nwithout committing great ravages, to tell the truth. The top alone of\nthe Corinthe façade suffered; the window on the first floor, and the\nattic window in the roof, riddled with buckshot and biscaïens, were\nslowly losing their shape. The combatants who had been posted there had\nbeen obliged to withdraw. However, this is according to the tactics of\nbarricades; to fire for a long while, in order to exhaust the\ninsurgents’ ammunition, if they commit the mistake of replying. When it\nis perceived, from the slackening of their fire, that they have no more\npowder and ball, the assault is made. Enjolras had not fallen into this\ntrap; the barricade did not reply.\n\nAt every discharge by platoons, Gavroche puffed out his cheek with his\ntongue, a sign of supreme disdain.\n\n“Good for you,” said he, “rip up the cloth. We want some lint.”\n\n\nCourfeyrac called the grape-shot to order for the little effect which\nit produced, and said to the cannon:\n\n“You are growing diffuse, my good fellow.”\n\n\nOne gets puzzled in battle, as at a ball. It is probable that this\nsilence on the part of the redoubt began to render the besiegers\nuneasy, and to make them fear some unexpected incident, and that they\nfelt the necessity of getting a clear view behind that heap of\npaving-stones, and of knowing what was going on behind that impassable\nwall which received blows without retorting. The insurgents suddenly\nperceived a helmet glittering in the sun on a neighboring roof. A\nfireman had placed his back against a tall chimney, and seemed to be\nacting as sentinel. His glance fell directly down into the barricade.\n\n“There’s an embarrassing watcher,” said Enjolras.\n\nJean Valjean had returned Enjolras’ rifle, but he had his own gun.\n\nWithout saying a word, he took aim at the fireman, and, a second later,\nthe helmet, smashed by a bullet, rattled noisily into the street. The\nterrified soldier made haste to disappear. A second observer took his\nplace. This one was an officer. Jean Valjean, who had re-loaded his\ngun, took aim at the newcomer and sent the officer’s casque to join the\nsoldier’s. The officer did not persist, and retired speedily. This time\nthe warning was understood. No one made his appearance thereafter on\nthat roof; and the idea of spying on the barricade was abandoned.\n\n“Why did you not kill the man?” Bossuet asked Jean Valjean.\n\nJean Valjean made no reply.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII—DISORDER A PARTISAN OF ORDER\n\n\nBossuet muttered in Combeferre’s ear:\n\n“He did not answer my question.”\n\n\n“He is a man who does good by gun-shots,” said Combeferre.\n\nThose who have preserved some memory of this already distant epoch know\nthat the National Guard from the suburbs was valiant against\ninsurrections. It was particularly zealous and intrepid in the days of\nJune, 1832. A certain good dram-shop keeper of Pantin des Vertus or la\nCunette, whose “establishment” had been closed by the riots, became\nleonine at the sight of his deserted dance-hall, and got himself killed\nto preserve the order represented by a tea-garden. In that bourgeois\nand heroic time, in the presence of ideas which had their knights,\ninterests had their paladins. The prosiness of the originators\ndetracted nothing from the bravery of the movement. The diminution of a\npile of crowns made bankers sing the Marseillaise. They shed their\nblood lyrically for the counting-house; and they defended the shop,\nthat immense diminutive of the fatherland, with Lacedæmonian\nenthusiasm.\n\nAt bottom, we will observe, there was nothing in all this that was not\nextremely serious. It was social elements entering into strife, while\nawaiting the day when they should enter into equilibrium.\n\nAnother sign of the times was the anarchy mingled with governmentalism\n[the barbarous name of the correct party]. People were for order in\ncombination with lack of discipline.\n\nThe drum suddenly beat capricious calls, at the command of such or such\na Colonel of the National Guard; such and such a captain went into\naction through inspiration; such and such National Guardsmen fought,\n“for an idea,” and on their own account. At critical moments, on “days”\nthey took counsel less of their leaders than of their instincts. There\nexisted in the army of order, veritable guerilleros, some of the sword,\nlike Fannicot, others of the pen, like Henri Fonfrède.\n\nCivilization, unfortunately, represented at this epoch rather by an\naggregation of interests than by a group of principles, was or thought\nitself, in peril; it set up the cry of alarm; each, constituting\nhimself a centre, defended it, succored it, and protected it with his\nown head; and the first comer took it upon himself to save society.\n\nZeal sometimes proceeded to extermination. A platoon of the National\nGuard would constitute itself on its own authority a private council of\nwar, and judge and execute a captured insurgent in five minutes. It was\nan improvisation of this sort that had slain Jean Prouvaire. Fierce\nLynch law, with which no one party had any right to reproach the rest,\nfor it has been applied by the Republic in America, as well as by the\nmonarchy in Europe. This Lynch law was complicated with mistakes. On\none day of rioting, a young poet, named Paul Aimé Garnier, was pursued\nin the Place Royale, with a bayonet at his loins, and only escaped by\ntaking refuge under the porte-cochère of No. 6. They shouted:—“There’s\nanother of those Saint-Simonians!” and they wanted to kill him. Now, he\nhad under his arm a volume of the memoirs of the Duc de Saint-Simon. A\nNational Guard had read the words _Saint-Simon_ on the book, and had\nshouted: “Death!”\n\n\nOn the 6th of June, 1832, a company of the National Guards from the\nsuburbs, commanded by the Captain Fannicot, above mentioned, had itself\ndecimated in the Rue de la Chanvrerie out of caprice and its own good\npleasure. This fact, singular though it may seem, was proved at the\njudicial investigation opened in consequence of the insurrection of\n1832. Captain Fannicot, a bold and impatient bourgeois, a sort of\ncondottiere of the order of those whom we have just characterized, a\nfanatical and intractable governmentalist, could not resist the\ntemptation to fire prematurely, and the ambition of capturing the\nbarricade alone and unaided, that is to say, with his company.\nExasperated by the successive apparition of the red flag and the old\ncoat which he took for the black flag, he loudly blamed the generals\nand chiefs of the corps, who were holding council and did not think\nthat the moment for the decisive assault had arrived, and who were\nallowing “the insurrection to fry in its own fat,” to use the\ncelebrated expression of one of them. For his part, he thought the\nbarricade ripe, and as that which is ripe ought to fall, he made the\nattempt.\n\nHe commanded men as resolute as himself, “raging fellows,” as a witness\nsaid. His company, the same which had shot Jean Prouvaire the poet, was\nthe first of the battalion posted at the angle of the street. At the\nmoment when they were least expecting it, the captain launched his men\nagainst the barricade. This movement, executed with more good will than\nstrategy, cost the Fannicot company dear. Before it had traversed two\nthirds of the street it was received by a general discharge from the\nbarricade. Four, the most audacious, who were running on in front, were\nmown down point-blank at the very foot of the redoubt, and this\ncourageous throng of National Guards, very brave men but lacking in\nmilitary tenacity, were forced to fall back, after some hesitation,\nleaving fifteen corpses on the pavement. This momentary hesitation gave\nthe insurgents time to re-load their weapons, and a second and very\ndestructive discharge struck the company before it could regain the\ncorner of the street, its shelter. A moment more, and it was caught\nbetween two fires, and it received the volley from the battery piece\nwhich, not having received the order, had not discontinued its firing.\n\nThe intrepid and imprudent Fannicot was one of the dead from this\ngrape-shot. He was killed by the cannon, that is to say, by order.\n\nThis attack, which was more furious than serious, irritated\nEnjolras.—“The fools!” said he. “They are getting their own men killed\nand they are using up our ammunition for nothing.”\n\n\nEnjolras spoke like the real general of insurrection which he was.\nInsurrection and repression do not fight with equal weapons.\nInsurrection, which is speedily exhausted, has only a certain number of\nshots to fire and a certain number of combatants to expend. An empty\ncartridge-box, a man killed, cannot be replaced. As repression has the\narmy, it does not count its men, and, as it has Vincennes, it does not\ncount its shots. Repression has as many regiments as the barricade has\nmen, and as many arsenals as the barricade has cartridge-boxes. Thus\nthey are struggles of one against a hundred, which always end in\ncrushing the barricade; unless the revolution, uprising suddenly,\nflings into the balance its flaming archangel’s sword. This does happen\nsometimes. Then everything rises, the pavements begin to seethe,\npopular redoubts abound. Paris quivers supremely, the _quid divinum_ is\ngiven forth, a 10th of August is in the air, a 29th of July is in the\nair, a wonderful light appears, the yawning maw of force draws back,\nand the army, that lion, sees before it, erect and tranquil, that\nprophet, France.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII—PASSING GLEAMS\n\n\nIn the chaos of sentiments and passions which defend a barricade, there\nis a little of everything; there is bravery, there is youth, honor,\nenthusiasm, the ideal, conviction, the rage of the gambler, and, above\nall, intermittences of hope.\n\nOne of these intermittences, one of these vague quivers of hope\nsuddenly traversed the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie at the\nmoment when it was least expected.\n\n“Listen,” suddenly cried Enjolras, who was still on the watch, “it\nseems to me that Paris is waking up.”\n\n\nIt is certain that, on the morning of the 6th of June, the insurrection\nbroke out afresh for an hour or two, to a certain extent. The obstinacy\nof the alarm peal of Saint-Merry reanimated some fancies. Barricades\nwere begun in the Rue du Poirier and the Rue des Gravilliers. In front\nof the Porte Saint-Martin, a young man, armed with a rifle, attacked\nalone a squadron of cavalry. In plain sight, on the open boulevard, he\nplaced one knee on the ground, shouldered his weapon, fired, killed the\ncommander of the squadron, and turned away, saying: “There’s another\nwho will do us no more harm.”\n\n\nHe was put to the sword. In the Rue Saint-Denis, a woman fired on the\nNational Guard from behind a lowered blind. The slats of the blind\ncould be seen to tremble at every shot. A child fourteen years of age\nwas arrested in the Rue de la Cossonerie, with his pockets full of\ncartridges. Many posts were attacked. At the entrance to the Rue\nBertin-Poirée, a very lively and utterly unexpected fusillade welcomed\na regiment of cuirrassiers, at whose head marched Marshal General\nCavaignac de Barague. In the Rue Planche-Mibray, they threw old pieces\nof pottery and household utensils down on the soldiers from the roofs;\na bad sign; and when this matter was reported to Marshal Soult,\nNapoleon’s old lieutenant grew thoughtful, as he recalled Suchet’s\nsaying at Saragossa: “We are lost when the old women empty their pots\nde chambre on our heads.”\n\n\nThese general symptoms which presented themselves at the moment when it\nwas thought that the uprising had been rendered local, this fever of\nwrath, these sparks which flew hither and thither above those deep\nmasses of combustibles which are called the faubourgs of Paris,—all\nthis, taken together, disturbed the military chiefs. They made haste to\nstamp out these beginnings of conflagration.\n\nThey delayed the attack on the barricades Maubuée, de la Chanvrerie and\nSaint-Merry until these sparks had been extinguished, in order that\nthey might have to deal with the barricades only and be able to finish\nthem at one blow. Columns were thrown into the streets where there was\nfermentation, sweeping the large, sounding the small, right and left,\nnow slowly and cautiously, now at full charge. The troops broke in the\ndoors of houses whence shots had been fired; at the same time,\nmanœuvres by the cavalry dispersed the groups on the boulevards. This\nrepression was not effected without some commotion, and without that\ntumultuous uproar peculiar to collisions between the army and the\npeople. This was what Enjolras had caught in the intervals of the\ncannonade and the musketry. Moreover, he had seen wounded men passing\nthe end of the street in litters, and he said to Courfeyrac:—“Those\nwounded do not come from us.”\n\n\nTheir hope did not last long; the gleam was quickly eclipsed. In less\nthan half an hour, what was in the air vanished, it was a flash of\nlightning unaccompanied by thunder, and the insurgents felt that sort\nof leaden cope, which the indifference of the people casts over\nobstinate and deserted men, fall over them once more.\n\nThe general movement, which seemed to have assumed a vague outline, had\nmiscarried; and the attention of the minister of war and the strategy\nof the generals could now be concentrated on the three or four\nbarricades which still remained standing.\n\nThe sun was mounting above the horizon.\n\nAn insurgent hailed Enjolras.\n\n“We are hungry here. Are we really going to die like this, without\nanything to eat?”\n\n\nEnjolras, who was still leaning on his elbows at his embrasure, made an\naffirmative sign with his head, but without taking his eyes from the\nend of the street.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV—WHEREIN WILL APPEAR THE NAME OF ENJOLRAS’ MISTRESS\n\n\nCourfeyrac, seated on a paving-stone beside Enjolras, continued to\ninsult the cannon, and each time that that gloomy cloud of projectiles\nwhich is called grape-shot passed overhead with its terrible sound he\nassailed it with a burst of irony.\n\n“You are wearing out your lungs, poor, brutal, old fellow, you pain me,\nyou are wasting your row. That’s not thunder, it’s a cough.”\n\n\nAnd the bystanders laughed.\n\nCourfeyrac and Bossuet, whose brave good humor increased with the\nperil, like Madame Scarron, replaced nourishment with pleasantry, and,\nas wine was lacking, they poured out gayety to all.\n\n“I admire Enjolras,” said Bossuet. “His impassive temerity astounds me.\nHe lives alone, which renders him a little sad, perhaps; Enjolras\ncomplains of his greatness, which binds him to widowhood. The rest of\nus have mistresses, more or less, who make us crazy, that is to say,\nbrave. When a man is as much in love as a tiger, the least that he can\ndo is to fight like a lion. That is one way of taking our revenge for\nthe capers that mesdames our grisettes play on us. Roland gets himself\nkilled for Angélique; all our heroism comes from our women. A man\nwithout a woman is a pistol without a trigger; it is the woman that\nsets the man off. Well, Enjolras has no woman. He is not in love, and\nyet he manages to be intrepid. It is a thing unheard of that a man\nshould be as cold as ice and as bold as fire.”\n\n\nEnjolras did not appear to be listening, but had any one been near him,\nthat person would have heard him mutter in a low voice: “Patria.”\n\n\nBossuet was still laughing when Courfeyrac exclaimed:\n\n“News!”\n\n\nAnd assuming the tone of an usher making an announcement, he added:\n\n“My name is Eight-Pounder.”\n\n\nIn fact, a new personage had entered on the scene. This was a second\npiece of ordnance.\n\nThe artillery-men rapidly performed their manœuvres in force and placed\nthis second piece in line with the first.\n\nThis outlined the catastrophe.\n\nA few minutes later, the two pieces, rapidly served, were firing\npoint-blank at the redoubt; the platoon firing of the line and of the\nsoldiers from the suburbs sustained the artillery.\n\nAnother cannonade was audible at some distance. At the same time that\nthe two guns were furiously attacking the redoubt from the Rue de la\nChanvrerie, two other cannons, trained one from the Rue Saint-Denis,\nthe other from the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, were riddling the Saint-Merry\nbarricade. The four cannons echoed each other mournfully.\n\nThe barking of these sombre dogs of war replied to each other.\n\nOne of the two pieces which was now battering the barricade on the Rue\nde la Chanvrerie was firing grape-shot, the other balls.\n\nThe piece which was firing balls was pointed a little high, and the aim\nwas calculated so that the ball struck the extreme edge of the upper\ncrest of the barricade, and crumbled the stone down upon the\ninsurgents, mingled with bursts of grape-shot.\n\nThe object of this mode of firing was to drive the insurgents from the\nsummit of the redoubt, and to compel them to gather close in the\ninterior, that is to say, this announced the assault.\n\nThe combatants once driven from the crest of the barricade by balls,\nand from the windows of the cabaret by grape-shot, the attacking\ncolumns could venture into the street without being picked off,\nperhaps, even, without being seen, could briskly and suddenly scale the\nredoubt, as on the preceding evening, and, who knows? take it by\nsurprise.\n\n“It is absolutely necessary that the inconvenience of those guns should\nbe diminished,” said Enjolras, and he shouted: “Fire on the\nartillery-men!”\n\n\nAll were ready. The barricade, which had long been silent, poured forth\na desperate fire; seven or eight discharges followed, with a sort of\nrage and joy; the street was filled with blinding smoke, and, at the\nend of a few minutes, athwart this mist all streaked with flame, two\nthirds of the gunners could be distinguished lying beneath the wheels\nof the cannons. Those who were left standing continued to serve the\npieces with severe tranquillity, but the fire had slackened.\n\n“Things are going well now,” said Bossuet to Enjolras. “Success.”\n\n\nEnjolras shook his head and replied:\n\n“Another quarter of an hour of this success, and there will not be any\ncartridges left in the barricade.”\n\n\nIt appears that Gavroche overheard this remark.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV—GAVROCHE OUTSIDE\n\n\nCourfeyrac suddenly caught sight of some one at the base of the\nbarricade, outside in the street, amid the bullets.\n\nGavroche had taken a bottle basket from the wine-shop, had made his way\nout through the cut, and was quietly engaged in emptying the full\ncartridge-boxes of the National Guardsmen who had been killed on the\nslope of the redoubt, into his basket.\n\n“What are you doing there?” asked Courfeyrac.\n\nGavroche raised his face:—\n\n“I’m filling my basket, citizen.”\n\n\n“Don’t you see the grape-shot?”\n\n\nGavroche replied:\n\n“Well, it is raining. What then?”\n\n\nCourfeyrac shouted:—“Come in!”\n\n\n“Instanter,” said Gavroche.\n\nAnd with a single bound he plunged into the street.\n\nIt will be remembered that Fannicot’s company had left behind it a\ntrail of bodies. Twenty corpses lay scattered here and there on the\npavement, through the whole length of the street. Twenty cartouches for\nGavroche meant a provision of cartridges for the barricade.\n\nThe smoke in the street was like a fog. Whoever has beheld a cloud\nwhich has fallen into a mountain gorge between two peaked escarpments\ncan imagine this smoke rendered denser and thicker by two gloomy rows\nof lofty houses. It rose gradually and was incessantly renewed; hence a\ntwilight which made even the broad daylight turn pale. The combatants\ncould hardly see each other from one end of the street to the other,\nshort as it was.\n\nThis obscurity, which had probably been desired and calculated on by\nthe commanders who were to direct the assault on the barricade, was\nuseful to Gavroche.\n\nBeneath the folds of this veil of smoke, and thanks to his small size,\nhe could advance tolerably far into the street without being seen. He\nrifled the first seven or eight cartridge-boxes without much danger.\n\nHe crawled flat on his belly, galloped on all fours, took his basket in\nhis teeth, twisted, glided, undulated, wound from one dead body to\nanother, and emptied the cartridge-box or cartouche as a monkey opens a\nnut.\n\nThey did not dare to shout to him to return from the barricade, which\nwas quite near, for fear of attracting attention to him.\n\nOn one body, that of a corporal, he found a powder-flask.\n\n“For thirst,” said he, putting it in his pocket.\n\nBy dint of advancing, he reached a point where the fog of the fusillade\nbecame transparent. So that the sharpshooters of the line ranged on the\noutlook behind their paving-stone dike and the sharpshooters of the\nbanlieue massed at the corner of the street suddenly pointed out to\neach other something moving through the smoke.\n\nAt the moment when Gavroche was relieving a sergeant, who was lying\nnear a stone door-post, of his cartridges, a bullet struck the body.\n\n“Fichtre!” ejaculated Gavroche. “They are killing my dead men for me.”\n\n\nA second bullet struck a spark from the pavement beside him.—A third\noverturned his basket.\n\nGavroche looked and saw that this came from the men of the banlieue.\n\nHe sprang to his feet, stood erect, with his hair flying in the wind,\nhis hands on his hips, his eyes fixed on the National Guardsmen who\nwere firing, and sang:\n\n“On est laid à Nanterre,       “Men are ugly at Nanterre,\nC’est la faute à Voltaire;     ‘Tis the  fault of Voltaire;\nEt bête à Palaiseau,           And dull at Palaiseau,\nC’est la faute à Rousseau.”    ‘Tis the fault of Rousseau.”\n\n\nThen he picked up his basket, replaced the cartridges which had fallen\nfrom it, without missing a single one, and, advancing towards the\nfusillade, set about plundering another cartridge-box. There a fourth\nbullet missed him, again. Gavroche sang:\n\n“Je ne suis pas notaire,      “I am not a notary,\nC’est la faute à Voltaire;    ‘Tis the fault of Voltaire;\nJe suis un petit oiseau,      I’m a little bird,\nC’est la faute à Rousseau.”   ‘Tis the fault of Rousseau.”\n\n\nA fifth bullet only succeeded in drawing from him a third couplet.\n\n“Joie est mon caractère,      “Joy is my character,\nC’est la faute à Voltaire;    ‘Tis the fault of Voltaire;\nMisère est mon trousseau,     Misery is my trousseau,\nC’est la faute à Rousseau.”   ‘Tis the fault of Rousseau.”\n\n\nThus it went on for some time.\n\nIt was a charming and terrible sight. Gavroche, though shot at, was\nteasing the fusillade. He had the air of being greatly diverted. It was\nthe sparrow pecking at the sportsmen. To each discharge he retorted\nwith a couplet. They aimed at him constantly, and always missed him.\nThe National Guardsmen and the soldiers laughed as they took aim at\nhim. He lay down, sprang to his feet, hid in the corner of a doorway,\nthen made a bound, disappeared, reappeared, scampered away, returned,\nreplied to the grape-shot with his thumb at his nose, and, all the\nwhile, went on pillaging the cartouches, emptying the cartridge-boxes,\nand filling his basket. The insurgents, panting with anxiety, followed\nhim with their eyes. The barricade trembled; he sang. He was not a\nchild, he was not a man; he was a strange gamin-fairy. He might have\nbeen called the invulnerable dwarf of the fray. The bullets flew after\nhim, he was more nimble than they. He played a fearful game of hide and\nseek with death; every time that the flat-nosed face of the spectre\napproached, the urchin administered to it a fillip.\n\nOne bullet, however, better aimed or more treacherous than the rest,\nfinally struck the will-o’-the-wisp of a child. Gavroche was seen to\nstagger, then he sank to the earth. The whole barricade gave vent to a\ncry; but there was something of Antæus in that pygmy; for the gamin to\ntouch the pavement is the same as for the giant to touch the earth;\nGavroche had fallen only to rise again; he remained in a sitting\nposture, a long thread of blood streaked his face, he raised both arms\nin the air, glanced in the direction whence the shot had come, and\nbegan to sing:\n\n“Je suis tombé par terre,     “I have fallen to the earth,\nC’est la faute à Voltaire;    ‘Tis the fault of Voltaire;\nLe nez dans le ruisseau,      With my nose in the gutter,\nC’est la faute à . . . “      ‘Tis the fault of . . . ”\n\n\nHe did not finish. A second bullet from the same marksman stopped him\nshort. This time he fell face downward on the pavement, and moved no\nmore. This grand little soul had taken its flight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI—HOW FROM A BROTHER ONE BECOMES A FATHER\n\n\nAt that same moment, in the garden of the Luxembourg,—for the gaze of\nthe drama must be everywhere present,—two children were holding each\nother by the hand. One might have been seven years old, the other five.\nThe rain having soaked them, they were walking along the paths on the\nsunny side; the elder was leading the younger; they were pale and\nragged; they had the air of wild birds. The smaller of them said: “I am\nvery hungry.”\n\n\nThe elder, who was already somewhat of a protector, was leading his\nbrother with his left hand and in his right he carried a small stick.\n\nThey were alone in the garden. The garden was deserted, the gates had\nbeen closed by order of the police, on account of the insurrection. The\ntroops who had been bivouacking there had departed for the exigencies\nof combat.\n\nHow did those children come there? Perhaps they had escaped from some\nguard-house which stood ajar; perhaps there was in the vicinity, at the\nBarrière d’Enfer; or on the Esplanade de l’Observatoire, or in the\nneighboring carrefour, dominated by the pediment on which could be\nread: _Invenerunt parvulum pannis involutum_, some mountebank’s booth\nfrom which they had fled; perhaps they had, on the preceding evening,\nescaped the eye of the inspectors of the garden at the hour of closing,\nand had passed the night in some one of those sentry-boxes where people\nread the papers? The fact is, they were stray lambs and they seemed\nfree. To be astray and to seem free is to be lost. These poor little\ncreatures were, in fact, lost.\n\nThese two children were the same over whom Gavroche had been put to\nsome trouble, as the reader will recollect. Children of the\nThénardiers, leased out to Magnon, attributed to M. Gillenormand, and\nnow leaves fallen from all these rootless branches, and swept over the\nground by the wind. Their clothing, which had been clean in Magnon’s\nday, and which had served her as a prospectus with M. Gillenormand, had\nbeen converted into rags.\n\nHenceforth these beings belonged to the statistics as “Abandoned\nchildren,” whom the police take note of, collect, mislay and find again\non the pavements of Paris.\n\nIt required the disturbance of a day like that to account for these\nmiserable little creatures being in that garden. If the superintendents\nhad caught sight of them, they would have driven such rags forth. Poor\nlittle things do not enter public gardens; still, people should reflect\nthat, as children, they have a right to flowers.\n\nThese children were there, thanks to the locked gates. They were there\ncontrary to the regulations. They had slipped into the garden and there\nthey remained. Closed gates do not dismiss the inspectors, oversight is\nsupposed to continue, but it grows slack and reposes; and the\ninspectors, moved by the public anxiety and more occupied with the\noutside than the inside, no longer glanced into the garden, and had not\nseen the two delinquents.\n\nIt had rained the night before, and even a little in the morning. But\nin June, showers do not count for much. An hour after a storm, it can\nhardly be seen that the beautiful blonde day has wept. The earth, in\nsummer, is as quickly dried as the cheek of a child. At that period of\nthe solstice, the light of full noonday is, so to speak, poignant. It\ntakes everything. It applies itself to the earth, and superposes itself\nwith a sort of suction. One would say that the sun was thirsty. A\nshower is but a glass of water; a rainstorm is instantly drunk up. In\nthe morning everything was dripping, in the afternoon everything is\npowdered over.\n\nNothing is so worthy of admiration as foliage washed by the rain and\nwiped by the rays of sunlight; it is warm freshness. The gardens and\nmeadows, having water at their roots, and sun in their flowers, become\nperfuming-pans of incense, and smoke with all their odors at once.\nEverything smiles, sings and offers itself. One feels gently\nintoxicated. The springtime is a provisional paradise, the sun helps\nman to have patience.\n\nThere are beings who demand nothing further; mortals, who, having the\nazure of heaven, say: “It is enough!” dreamers absorbed in the\nwonderful, dipping into the idolatry of nature, indifferent to good and\nevil, contemplators of cosmos and radiantly forgetful of man, who do\nnot understand how people can occupy themselves with the hunger of\nthese, and the thirst of those, with the nudity of the poor in winter,\nwith the lymphatic curvature of the little spinal column, with the\npallet, the attic, the dungeon, and the rags of shivering young girls,\nwhen they can dream beneath the trees; peaceful and terrible spirits\nthey, and pitilessly satisfied. Strange to say, the infinite suffices\nthem. That great need of man, the finite, which admits of embrace, they\nignore. The finite which admits of progress and sublime toil, they do\nnot think about. The indefinite, which is born from the human and\ndivine combination of the infinite and the finite, escapes them.\nProvided that they are face to face with immensity, they smile. Joy\nnever, ecstasy forever. Their life lies in surrendering their\npersonality in contemplation. The history of humanity is for them only\na detailed plan. All is not there; the true All remains without; what\nis the use of busying oneself over that detail, man? Man suffers, that\nis quite possible; but look at Aldebaran rising! The mother has no more\nmilk, the new-born babe is dying. I know nothing about that, but just\nlook at this wonderful rosette which a slice of wood-cells of the pine\npresents under the microscope! Compare the most beautiful Mechlin lace\nto that if you can! These thinkers forget to love. The zodiac thrives\nwith them to such a point that it prevents their seeing the weeping\nchild. God eclipses their souls. This is a family of minds which are,\nat once, great and petty. Horace was one of them; so was Goethe. La\nFontaine perhaps; magnificent egoists of the infinite, tranquil\nspectators of sorrow, who do not behold Nero if the weather be fair,\nfor whom the sun conceals the funeral pile, who would look on at an\nexecution by the guillotine in the search for an effect of light, who\nhear neither the cry nor the sob, nor the death rattle, nor the alarm\npeal, for whom everything is well, since there is a month of May, who,\nso long as there are clouds of purple and gold above their heads,\ndeclare themselves content, and who are determined to be happy until\nthe radiance of the stars and the songs of the birds are exhausted.\n\nThese are dark radiances. They have no suspicion that they are to be\npitied. Certainly they are so. He who does not weep does not see. They\nare to be admired and pitied, as one would both pity and admire a being\nat once night and day, without eyes beneath his lashes but with a star\non his brow.\n\nThe indifference of these thinkers, is, according to some, a superior\nphilosophy. That may be; but in this superiority there is some\ninfirmity. One may be immortal and yet limp: witness Vulcan. One may be\nmore than man and less than man. There is incomplete immensity in\nnature. Who knows whether the sun is not a blind man?\n\nBut then, what? In whom can we trust? _Solem quis dicere falsum\naudeat?_ Who shall dare to say that the sun is false? Thus certain\ngeniuses, themselves, certain Very-Lofty mortals, man-stars, may be\nmistaken? That which is on high at the summit, at the crest, at the\nzenith, that which sends down so much light on the earth, sees but\nlittle, sees badly, sees not at all? Is not this a desperate state of\nthings? No. But what is there, then, above the sun? The god.\n\nOn the 6th of June, 1832, about eleven o’clock in the morning, the\nLuxembourg, solitary and depopulated, was charming. The quincunxes and\nflower-beds shed forth balm and dazzling beauty into the sunlight. The\nbranches, wild with the brilliant glow of midday, seemed endeavoring to\nembrace. In the sycamores there was an uproar of linnets, sparrows\ntriumphed, woodpeckers climbed along the chestnut trees, administering\nlittle pecks on the bark. The flower-beds accepted the legitimate\nroyalty of the lilies; the most august of perfumes is that which\nemanates from whiteness. The peppery odor of the carnations was\nperceptible. The old crows of Marie de Medici were amorous in the tall\ntrees. The sun gilded, empurpled, set fire to and lighted up the\ntulips, which are nothing but all the varieties of flame made into\nflowers. All around the banks of tulips the bees, the sparks of these\nflame-flowers, hummed. All was grace and gayety, even the impending\nrain; this relapse, by which the lilies of the valley and the\nhoneysuckles were destined to profit, had nothing disturbing about it;\nthe swallows indulged in the charming threat of flying low. He who was\nthere aspired to happiness; life smelled good; all nature exhaled\ncandor, help, assistance, paternity, caress, dawn. The thoughts which\nfell from heaven were as sweet as the tiny hand of a baby when one\nkisses it.\n\nThe statues under the trees, white and nude, had robes of shadow\npierced with light; these goddesses were all tattered with sunlight;\nrays hung from them on all sides. Around the great fountain, the earth\nwas already dried up to the point of being burnt. There was sufficient\nbreeze to raise little insurrections of dust here and there. A few\nyellow leaves, left over from the autumn, chased each other merrily,\nand seemed to be playing tricks on each other.\n\nThis abundance of light had something indescribably reassuring about\nit. Life, sap, heat, odors overflowed; one was conscious, beneath\ncreation, of the enormous size of the source; in all these breaths\npermeated with love, in this interchange of reverberations and\nreflections, in this marvellous expenditure of rays, in this infinite\noutpouring of liquid gold, one felt the prodigality of the\ninexhaustible; and, behind this splendor as behind a curtain of flame,\none caught a glimpse of God, that millionaire of stars.\n\nThanks to the sand, there was not a speck of mud; thanks to the rain,\nthere was not a grain of ashes. The clumps of blossoms had just been\nbathed; every sort of velvet, satin, gold and varnish, which springs\nfrom the earth in the form of flowers, was irreproachable. This\nmagnificence was cleanly. The grand silence of happy nature filled the\ngarden. A celestial silence that is compatible with a thousand sorts of\nmusic, the cooing of nests, the buzzing of swarms, the flutterings of\nthe breeze. All the harmony of the season was complete in one gracious\nwhole; the entrances and exits of spring took place in proper order;\nthe lilacs ended; the jasmines began; some flowers were tardy, some\ninsects in advance of their time; the van-guard of the red June\nbutterflies fraternized with the rear-guard of the white butterflies of\nMay. The plantain trees were getting their new skins. The breeze\nhollowed out undulations in the magnificent enormity of the\nchestnut-trees. It was splendid. A veteran from the neighboring\nbarracks, who was gazing through the fence, said: “Here is the Spring\npresenting arms and in full uniform.”\n\n\nAll nature was breakfasting; creation was at table; this was its hour;\nthe great blue cloth was spread in the sky, and the great green cloth\non earth; the sun lighted it all up brilliantly. God was serving the\nuniversal repast. Each creature had his pasture or his mess. The\nring-dove found his hemp-seed, the chaffinch found his millet, the\ngoldfinch found chickweed, the red-breast found worms, the green finch\nfound flies, the fly found infusoriæ, the bee found flowers. They ate\neach other somewhat, it is true, which is the misery of evil mixed with\ngood; but not a beast of them all had an empty stomach.\n\nThe two little abandoned creatures had arrived in the vicinity of the\ngrand fountain, and, rather bewildered by all this light, they tried to\nhide themselves, the instinct of the poor and the weak in the presence\nof even impersonal magnificence; and they kept behind the swans’ hutch.\n\nHere and there, at intervals, when the wind blew, shouts, clamor, a\nsort of tumultuous death rattle, which was the firing, and dull blows,\nwhich were discharges of cannon, struck the ear confusedly. Smoke hung\nover the roofs in the direction of the Halles. A bell, which had the\nair of an appeal, was ringing in the distance.\n\nThese children did not appear to notice these noises. The little one\nrepeated from time to time: “I am hungry.”\n\n\nAlmost at the same instant with the children, another couple approached\nthe great basin. They consisted of a goodman, about fifty years of age,\nwho was leading by the hand a little fellow of six. No doubt, a father\nand his son. The little man of six had a big brioche.\n\nAt that epoch, certain houses abutting on the river, in the Rues Madame\nand d’Enfer, had keys to the Luxembourg garden, of which the lodgers\nenjoyed the use when the gates were shut, a privilege which was\nsuppressed later on. This father and son came from one of these houses,\nno doubt.\n\nThe two poor little creatures watched “that gentleman” approaching, and\nhid themselves a little more thoroughly.\n\nHe was a bourgeois. The same person, perhaps, whom Marius had one day\nheard, through his love fever, near the same grand basin, counselling\nhis son “to avoid excesses.” He had an affable and haughty air, and a\nmouth which was always smiling, since it did not shut. This mechanical\nsmile, produced by too much jaw and too little skin, shows the teeth\nrather than the soul. The child, with his brioche, which he had bitten\ninto but had not finished eating, seemed satiated. The child was\ndressed as a National Guardsman, owing to the insurrection, and the\nfather had remained clad as a bourgeois out of prudence.\n\nFather and son halted near the fountain where two swans were sporting.\nThis bourgeois appeared to cherish a special admiration for the swans.\nHe resembled them in this sense, that he walked like them.\n\nFor the moment, the swans were swimming, which is their principal\ntalent, and they were superb.\n\nIf the two poor little beings had listened and if they had been of an\nage to understand, they might have gathered the words of this grave\nman. The father was saying to his son:\n\n“The sage lives content with little. Look at me, my son. I do not love\npomp. I am never seen in clothes decked with gold lace and stones; I\nleave that false splendor to badly organized souls.”\n\n\nHere the deep shouts which proceeded from the direction of the Halles\nburst out with fresh force of bell and uproar.\n\n“What is that?” inquired the child.\n\nThe father replied:\n\n“It is the Saturnalia.”\n\n\nAll at once, he caught sight of the two little ragged boys behind the\ngreen swan-hutch.\n\n“There is the beginning,” said he.\n\nAnd, after a pause, he added:\n\n“Anarchy is entering this garden.”\n\n\nIn the meanwhile, his son took a bite of his brioche, spit it out, and,\nsuddenly burst out crying.\n\n“What are you crying about?” demanded his father.\n\n“I am not hungry any more,” said the child.\n\nThe father’s smile became more accentuated.\n\n“One does not need to be hungry in order to eat a cake.”\n\n\n“My cake tires me. It is stale.”\n\n\n“Don’t you want any more of it?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\nThe father pointed to the swans.\n\n“Throw it to those palmipeds.”\n\n\nThe child hesitated. A person may not want any more of his cake; but\nthat is no reason for giving it away.\n\nThe father went on:\n\n“Be humane. You must have compassion on animals.”\n\n\nAnd, taking the cake from his son, he flung it into the basin.\n\nThe cake fell very near the edge.\n\nThe swans were far away, in the centre of the basin, and busy with some\nprey. They had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche.\n\nThe bourgeois, feeling that the cake was in danger of being wasted, and\nmoved by this useless shipwreck, entered upon a telegraphic agitation,\nwhich finally attracted the attention of the swans.\n\nThey perceived something floating, steered for the edge like ships, as\nthey are, and slowly directed their course toward the brioche, with the\nstupid majesty which befits white creatures.\n\n“The swans [_cygnes_] understand signs [_signes_],” said the bourgeois,\ndelighted to make a jest.\n\nAt that moment, the distant tumult of the city underwent another sudden\nincrease. This time it was sinister. There are some gusts of wind which\nspeak more distinctly than others. The one which was blowing at that\nmoment brought clearly defined drum-beats, clamors, platoon firing, and\nthe dismal replies of the tocsin and the cannon. This coincided with a\nblack cloud which suddenly veiled the sun.\n\nThe swans had not yet reached the brioche.\n\n“Let us return home,” said the father, “they are attacking the\nTuileries.”\n\n\nHe grasped his son’s hand again. Then he continued:\n\n“From the Tuileries to the Luxembourg, there is but the distance which\nseparates Royalty from the peerage; that is not far. Shots will soon\nrain down.”\n\n\nHe glanced at the cloud.\n\n“Perhaps it is rain itself that is about to shower down; the sky is\njoining in; the younger branch is condemned. Let us return home\nquickly.”\n\n\n“I should like to see the swans eat the brioche,” said the child.\n\nThe father replied:\n\n“That would be imprudent.”\n\n\nAnd he led his little bourgeois away.\n\nThe son, regretting the swans, turned his head back toward the basin\nuntil a corner of the quincunxes concealed it from him.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the two little waifs had approached the brioche at\nthe same time as the swans. It was floating on the water. The smaller\nof them stared at the cake, the elder gazed after the retreating\nbourgeois.\n\nFather and son entered the labyrinth of walks which leads to the grand\nflight of steps near the clump of trees on the side of the Rue Madame.\n\nAs soon as they had disappeared from view, the elder child hastily\nflung himself flat on his stomach on the rounding curb of the basin,\nand clinging to it with his left hand, and leaning over the water, on\nthe verge of falling in, he stretched out his right hand with his stick\ntowards the cake. The swans, perceiving the enemy, made haste, and in\nso doing, they produced an effect of their breasts which was of service\nto the little fisher; the water flowed back before the swans, and one\nof these gentle concentric undulations softly floated the brioche\ntowards the child’s wand. Just as the swans came up, the stick touched\nthe cake. The child gave it a brisk rap, drew in the brioche,\nfrightened away the swans, seized the cake, and sprang to his feet. The\ncake was wet; but they were hungry and thirsty. The elder broke the\ncake into two portions, a large one and a small one, took the small one\nfor himself, gave the large one to his brother, and said to him:\n\n“Ram that into your muzzle.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII—MORTUUS PATER FILIUM MORITURUM EXPECTAT\n\n\nMarius dashed out of the barricade, Combeferre followed him. But he was\ntoo late. Gavroche was dead. Combeferre brought back the basket of\ncartridges; Marius bore the child.\n\n“Alas!” he thought, “that which the father had done for his father, he\nwas requiting to the son; only, Thénardier had brought back his father\nalive; he was bringing back the child dead.”\n\n\nWhen Marius re-entered the redoubt with Gavroche in his arms, his face,\nlike the child, was inundated with blood.\n\nAt the moment when he had stooped to lift Gavroche, a bullet had grazed\nhis head; he had not noticed it.\n\nCourfeyrac untied his cravat and with it bandaged Marius’ brow.\n\nThey laid Gavroche on the same table with Mabeuf, and spread over the\ntwo corpses the black shawl. There was enough of it for both the old\nman and the child.\n\nCombeferre distributed the cartridges from the basket which he had\nbrought in.\n\nThis gave each man fifteen rounds to fire.\n\nJean Valjean was still in the same place, motionless on his stone post.\nWhen Combeferre offered him his fifteen cartridges, he shook his head.\n\n“Here’s a rare eccentric,” said Combeferre in a low voice to Enjolras.\n“He finds a way of not fighting in this barricade.”\n\n\n“Which does not prevent him from defending it,” responded Enjolras.\n\n“Heroism has its originals,” resumed Combeferre.\n\nAnd Courfeyrac, who had overheard, added:\n\n“He is another sort from Father Mabeuf.”\n\n\nOne thing which must be noted is, that the fire which was battering the\nbarricade hardly disturbed the interior. Those who have never traversed\nthe whirlwind of this sort of war can form no idea of the singular\nmoments of tranquillity mingled with these convulsions. Men go and\ncome, they talk, they jest, they lounge. Some one whom we know heard a\ncombatant say to him in the midst of the grape-shot: “We are here as at\na bachelor breakfast.” The redoubt of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, we\nrepeat, seemed very calm within. All mutations and all phases had been,\nor were about to be, exhausted. The position, from critical, had become\nmenacing, and, from menacing, was probably about to become desperate.\nIn proportion as the situation grew gloomy, the glow of heroism\nempurpled the barricade more and more. Enjolras, who was grave,\ndominated it, in the attitude of a young Spartan sacrificing his naked\nsword to the sombre genius, Epidotas.\n\nCombeferre, wearing an apron, was dressing the wounds: Bossuet and\nFeuilly were making cartridges with the powder-flask picked up by\nGavroche on the dead corporal, and Bossuet said to Feuilly: “We are\nsoon to take the diligence for another planet”; Courfeyrac was\ndisposing and arranging on some paving-stones which he had reserved for\nhimself near Enjolras, a complete arsenal, his sword-cane, his gun, two\nholster pistols, and a cudgel, with the care of a young girl setting a\nsmall dunkerque in order. Jean Valjean stared silently at the wall\nopposite him. An artisan was fastening Mother Hucheloup’s big straw hat\non his head with a string, “for fear of sun-stroke,” as he said. The\nyoung men from the Cougourde d’Aix were chatting merrily among\nthemselves, as though eager to speak patois for the last time. Joly,\nwho had taken Widow Hucheloup’s mirror from the wall, was examining his\ntongue in it. Some combatants, having discovered a few crusts of rather\nmouldy bread, in a drawer, were eagerly devouring them. Marius was\ndisturbed with regard to what his father was about to say to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII—THE VULTURE BECOME PREY\n\n\nWe must insist upon one psychological fact peculiar to barricades.\nNothing which is characteristic of that surprising war of the streets\nshould be omitted.\n\nWhatever may have been the singular inward tranquillity which we have\njust mentioned, the barricade, for those who are inside it, remains,\nnonetheless, a vision.\n\nThere is something of the apocalypse in civil war, all the mists of the\nunknown are commingled with fierce flashes, revolutions are sphinxes,\nand any one who has passed through a barricade thinks he has traversed\na dream.\n\nThe feelings to which one is subject in these places we have pointed\nout in the case of Marius, and we shall see the consequences; they are\nboth more and less than life. On emerging from a barricade, one no\nlonger knows what one has seen there. One has been terrible, but one\nknows it not. One has been surrounded with conflicting ideas which had\nhuman faces; one’s head has been in the light of the future. There were\ncorpses lying prone there, and phantoms standing erect. The hours were\ncolossal and seemed hours of eternity. One has lived in death. Shadows\nhave passed by. What were they?\n\nOne has beheld hands on which there was blood; there was a deafening\nhorror; there was also a frightful silence; there were open mouths\nwhich shouted, and other open mouths which held their peace; one was in\nthe midst of smoke, of night, perhaps. One fancied that one had touched\nthe sinister ooze of unknown depths; one stares at something red on\none’s finger nails. One no longer remembers anything.\n\nLet us return to the Rue de la Chanvrerie.\n\nAll at once, between two discharges, the distant sound of a clock\nstriking the hour became audible.\n\n“It is midday,” said Combeferre.\n\nThe twelve strokes had not finished striking when Enjolras sprang to\nhis feet, and from the summit of the barricade hurled this thundering\nshout:\n\n“Carry stones up into the houses; line the windowsills and the roofs\nwith them. Half the men to their guns, the other half to the\npaving-stones. There is not a minute to be lost.”\n\n\nA squad of sappers and miners, axe on shoulder, had just made their\nappearance in battle array at the end of the street.\n\nThis could only be the head of a column; and of what column? The\nattacking column, evidently; the sappers charged with the demolition of\nthe barricade must always precede the soldiers who are to scale it.\n\nThey were, evidently, on the brink of that moment which M.\nClermont-Tonnerre, in 1822, called “the tug of war.”\n\n\nEnjolras’ order was executed with the correct haste which is peculiar\nto ships and barricades, the only two scenes of combat where escape is\nimpossible. In less than a minute, two thirds of the stones which\nEnjolras had had piled up at the door of Corinthe had been carried up\nto the first floor and the attic, and before a second minute had\nelapsed, these stones, artistically set one upon the other, walled up\nthe sash-window on the first floor and the windows in the roof to half\ntheir height. A few loop-holes carefully planned by Feuilly, the\nprincipal architect, allowed of the passage of the gun-barrels. This\narmament of the windows could be effected all the more easily since the\nfiring of grape-shot had ceased. The two cannons were now discharging\nball against the centre of the barrier in order to make a hole there,\nand, if possible, a breach for the assault.\n\nWhen the stones destined to the final defence were in place, Enjolras\nhad the bottles which he had set under the table where Mabeuf lay,\ncarried to the first floor.\n\n“Who is to drink that?” Bossuet asked him.\n\n“They,” replied Enjolras.\n\nThen they barricaded the window below, and held in readiness the iron\ncross-bars which served to secure the door of the wine-shop at night.\n\nThe fortress was complete. The barricade was the rampart, the wine-shop\nwas the dungeon. With the stones which remained they stopped up the\noutlet.\n\nAs the defenders of a barricade are always obliged to be sparing of\ntheir ammunition, and as the assailants know this, the assailants\ncombine their arrangements with a sort of irritating leisure, expose\nthemselves to fire prematurely, though in appearance more than in\nreality, and take their ease. The preparations for attack are always\nmade with a certain methodical deliberation; after which, the lightning\nstrikes.\n\nThis deliberation permitted Enjolras to take a review of everything and\nto perfect everything. He felt that, since such men were to die, their\ndeath ought to be a masterpiece.\n\nHe said to Marius: “We are the two leaders. I will give the last orders\ninside. Do you remain outside and observe.”\n\n\nMarius posted himself on the lookout upon the crest of the barricade.\n\nEnjolras had the door of the kitchen, which was the ambulance, as the\nreader will remember, nailed up.\n\n“No splashing of the wounded,” he said.\n\nHe issued his final orders in the tap-room in a curt, but profoundly\ntranquil tone; Feuilly listened and replied in the name of all.\n\n“On the first floor, hold your axes in readiness to cut the staircase.\nHave you them?”\n\n\n“Yes,” said Feuilly.\n\n“How many?”\n\n\n“Two axes and a pole-axe.”\n\n\n“That is good. There are now twenty-six combatants of us on foot. How\nmany guns are there?”\n\n\n“Thirty-four.”\n\n\n“Eight too many. Keep those eight guns loaded like the rest and at\nhand. Swords and pistols in your belts. Twenty men to the barricade.\nSix ambushed in the attic windows, and at the window on the first floor\nto fire on the assailants through the loop-holes in the stones. Let not\na single worker remain inactive here. Presently, when the drum beats\nthe assault, let the twenty below stairs rush to the barricade. The\nfirst to arrive will have the best places.”\n\n\nThese arrangements made, he turned to Javert and said:\n\n“I am not forgetting you.”\n\n\nAnd, laying a pistol on the table, he added:\n\n“The last man to leave this room will smash the skull of this spy.”\n\n\n“Here?” inquired a voice.\n\n“No, let us not mix their corpses with our own. The little barricade of\nthe Mondétour lane can be scaled. It is only four feet high. The man is\nwell pinioned. He shall be taken thither and put to death.”\n\n\nThere was some one who was more impassive at that moment than Enjolras,\nit was Javert. Here Jean Valjean made his appearance.\n\nHe had been lost among the group of insurgents. He stepped forth and\nsaid to Enjolras:\n\n“You are the commander?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“You thanked me a while ago.”\n\n\n“In the name of the Republic. The barricade has two saviors, Marius\nPontmercy and yourself.”\n\n\n“Do you think that I deserve a recompense?”\n\n\n“Certainly.”\n\n\n“Well, I request one.”\n\n\n“What is it?”\n\n\n“That I may blow that man’s brains out.”\n\n\nJavert raised his head, saw Jean Valjean, made an almost imperceptible\nmovement, and said:\n\n“That is just.”\n\n\nAs for Enjolras, he had begun to re-load his rifle; he cut his eyes\nabout him:\n\n“No objections.”\n\n\nAnd he turned to Jean Valjean:\n\n“Take the spy.”\n\n\nJean Valjean did, in fact, take possession of Javert, by seating\nhimself on the end of the table. He seized the pistol, and a faint\nclick announced that he had cocked it.\n\nAlmost at the same moment, a blast of trumpets became audible.\n\n“Take care!” shouted Marius from the top of the barricade.\n\nJavert began to laugh with that noiseless laugh which was peculiar to\nhim, and gazing intently at the insurgents, he said to them:\n\n“You are in no better case than I am.”\n\n\n“All out!” shouted Enjolras.\n\nThe insurgents poured out tumultuously, and, as they went, received in\nthe back,—may we be permitted the expression,—this sally of Javert’s:\n\n“We shall meet again shortly!”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX—JEAN VALJEAN TAKES HIS REVENGE\n\n\nWhen Jean Valjean was left alone with Javert, he untied the rope which\nfastened the prisoner across the middle of the body, and the knot of\nwhich was under the table. After this he made him a sign to rise.\n\nJavert obeyed with that indefinable smile in which the supremacy of\nenchained authority is condensed.\n\nJean Valjean took Javert by the martingale, as one would take a beast\nof burden by the breast-band, and, dragging the latter after him,\nemerged from the wine-shop slowly, because Javert, with his impeded\nlimbs, could take only very short steps.\n\nJean Valjean had the pistol in his hand.\n\nIn this manner they crossed the inner trapezium of the barricade. The\ninsurgents, all intent on the attack, which was imminent, had their\nbacks turned to these two.\n\nMarius alone, stationed on one side, at the extreme left of the\nbarricade, saw them pass. This group of victim and executioner was\nilluminated by the sepulchral light which he bore in his own soul.\n\nJean Valjean with some difficulty, but without relaxing his hold for a\nsingle instant, made Javert, pinioned as he was, scale the little\nentrenchment in the Mondétour lane.\n\nWhen they had crossed this barrier, they found themselves alone in the\nlane. No one saw them. Among the heap they could distinguish a livid\nface, streaming hair, a pierced hand and the half nude breast of a\nwoman. It was Éponine. The corner of the houses hid them from the\ninsurgents. The corpses carried away from the barricade formed a\nterrible pile a few paces distant.\n\nJavert gazed askance at this body, and, profoundly calm, said in a low\ntone:\n\n“It strikes me that I know that girl.”\n\n\nThen he turned to Jean Valjean.\n\nJean Valjean thrust the pistol under his arm and fixed on Javert a look\nwhich it required no words to interpret: “Javert, it is I.”\n\n\nJavert replied:\n\n“Take your revenge.”\n\n\nJean Valjean drew from his pocket a knife, and opened it.\n\n“A clasp-knife!” exclaimed Javert, “you are right. That suits you\nbetter.”\n\n\nJean Valjean cut the martingale which Javert had about his neck, then\nhe cut the cords on his wrists, then, stooping down, he cut the cord on\nhis feet; and, straightening himself up, he said to him:\n\n“You are free.”\n\n\nJavert was not easily astonished. Still, master of himself though he\nwas, he could not repress a start. He remained open-mouthed and\nmotionless.\n\nJean Valjean continued:\n\n“I do not think that I shall escape from this place. But if, by chance,\nI do, I live, under the name of Fauchelevent, in the Rue de l’Homme\nArmé, No. 7.”\n\n\nJavert snarled like a tiger, which made him half open one corner of his\nmouth, and he muttered between his teeth:\n\n“Have a care.”\n\n\n“Go,” said Jean Valjean.\n\nJavert began again:\n\n“Thou saidst Fauchelevent, Rue de l’Homme Armé?”\n\n\n“Number 7.”\n\n\nJavert repeated in a low voice:—“Number 7.”\n\n\nHe buttoned up his coat once more, resumed the military stiffness\nbetween his shoulders, made a half turn, folded his arms and,\nsupporting his chin on one of his hands, he set out in the direction of\nthe Halles. Jean Valjean followed him with his eyes:\n\nA few minutes later, Javert turned round and shouted to Jean Valjean:\n\n“You annoy me. Kill me, rather.”\n\n\nJavert himself did not notice that he no longer addressed Jean Valjean\nas “thou.”\n\n\n“Be off with you,” said Jean Valjean.\n\nJavert retreated slowly. A moment later he turned the corner of the Rue\ndes Prêcheurs.\n\nWhen Javert had disappeared, Jean Valjean fired his pistol in the air.\n\nThen he returned to the barricade and said:\n\n“It is done.”\n\n\nIn the meanwhile, this is what had taken place.\n\nMarius, more intent on the outside than on the interior, had not, up to\nthat time, taken a good look at the pinioned spy in the dark background\nof the tap-room.\n\nWhen he beheld him in broad daylight, striding over the barricade in\norder to proceed to his death, he recognized him. Something suddenly\nrecurred to his mind. He recalled the inspector of the Rue de Pontoise,\nand the two pistols which the latter had handed to him and which he,\nMarius, had used in this very barricade, and not only did he recall his\nface, but his name as well.\n\nThis recollection was misty and troubled, however, like all his ideas.\n\nIt was not an affirmation that he made, but a question which he put to\nhimself:\n\n“Is not that the inspector of police who told me that his name was\nJavert?”\n\n\nPerhaps there was still time to intervene in behalf of that man. But,\nin the first place, he must know whether this was Javert.\n\nMarius called to Enjolras, who had just stationed himself at the other\nextremity of the barricade:\n\n“Enjolras!”\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“What is the name of yonder man?”\n\n\n“What man?”\n\n\n“The police agent. Do you know his name?”\n\n\n“Of course. He told us.”\n\n\n“What is it?”\n\n\n“Javert.”\n\n\nMarius sprang to his feet.\n\nAt that moment, they heard the report of the pistol.\n\nJean Valjean reappeared and cried: “It is done.”\n\n\nA gloomy chill traversed Marius’ heart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX—THE DEAD ARE IN THE RIGHT AND THE LIVING ARE NOT IN THE\nWRONG\n\n\nThe death agony of the barricade was about to begin.\n\nEverything contributed to its tragic majesty at that supreme moment; a\nthousand mysterious crashes in the air, the breath of armed masses set\nin movement in the streets which were not visible, the intermittent\ngallop of cavalry, the heavy shock of artillery on the march, the\nfiring by squads, and the cannonades crossing each other in the\nlabyrinth of Paris, the smokes of battle mounting all gilded above the\nroofs, indescribable and vaguely terrible cries, lightnings of menace\neverywhere, the tocsin of Saint-Merry, which now had the accents of a\nsob, the mildness of the weather, the splendor of the sky filled with\nsun and clouds, the beauty of the day, and the alarming silence of the\nhouses.\n\nFor, since the preceding evening, the two rows of houses in the Rue de\nla Chanvrerie had become two walls; ferocious walls, doors closed,\nwindows closed, shutters closed.\n\nIn those days, so different from those in which we live, when the hour\nwas come, when the people wished to put an end to a situation, which\nhad lasted too long, with a charter granted or with a legal country,\nwhen universal wrath was diffused in the atmosphere, when the city\nconsented to the tearing up of the pavements, when insurrection made\nthe bourgeoisie smile by whispering its password in its ear, then the\ninhabitant, thoroughly penetrated with the revolt, so to speak, was the\nauxiliary of the combatant, and the house fraternized with the\nimprovised fortress which rested on it. When the situation was not\nripe, when the insurrection was not decidedly admitted, when the masses\ndisowned the movement, all was over with the combatants, the city was\nchanged into a desert around the revolt, souls grew chilled, refuges\nwere nailed up, and the street turned into a defile to help the army to\ntake the barricade.\n\nA people cannot be forced, through surprise, to walk more quickly than\nit chooses. Woe to whomsoever tries to force its hand! A people does\nnot let itself go at random. Then it abandons the insurrection to\nitself. The insurgents become noxious, infected with the plague. A\nhouse is an escarpment, a door is a refusal, a façade is a wall. This\nwall hears, sees and will not. It might open and save you. No. This\nwall is a judge. It gazes at you and condemns you. What dismal things\nare closed houses. They seem dead, they are living. Life which is, as\nit were, suspended there, persists there. No one has gone out of them\nfor four and twenty hours, but no one is missing from them. In the\ninterior of that rock, people go and come, go to bed and rise again;\nthey are a family party there; there they eat and drink; they are\nafraid, a terrible thing! Fear excuses this fearful lack of\nhospitality; terror is mixed with it, an extenuating circumstance.\nSometimes, even, and this has been actually seen, fear turns to\npassion; fright may change into fury, as prudence does into rage; hence\nthis wise saying: “The enraged moderates.” There are outbursts of\nsupreme terror, whence springs wrath like a mournful smoke.—“What do\nthese people want? What have they come there to do? Let them get out of\nthe scrape. So much the worse for them. It is their fault. They are\nonly getting what they deserve. It does not concern us. Here is our\npoor street all riddled with balls. They are a pack of rascals. Above\nall things, don’t open the door.”—And the house assumes the air of a\ntomb. The insurgent is in the death-throes in front of that house; he\nsees the grape-shot and naked swords drawing near; if he cries, he\nknows that they are listening to him, and that no one will come; there\nstand walls which might protect him, there are men who might save him;\nand these walls have ears of flesh, and these men have bowels of stone.\n\nWhom shall he reproach?\n\nNo one and every one.\n\nThe incomplete times in which we live.\n\nIt is always at its own risk and peril that Utopia is converted into\nrevolution, and from philosophical protest becomes an armed protest,\nand from Minerva turns to Pallas.\n\nThe Utopia which grows impatient and becomes revolt knows what awaits\nit; it almost always comes too soon. Then it becomes resigned, and\nstoically accepts catastrophe in lieu of triumph. It serves those who\ndeny it without complaint, even excusing them, and even disculpates\nthem, and its magnanimity consists in consenting to abandonment. It is\nindomitable in the face of obstacles and gentle towards ingratitude.\n\nIs this ingratitude, however?\n\nYes, from the point of view of the human race.\n\nNo, from the point of view of the individual.\n\nProgress is man’s mode of existence. The general life of the human race\nis called Progress, the collective stride of the human race is called\nProgress. Progress advances; it makes the great human and terrestrial\njourney towards the celestial and the divine; it has its halting places\nwhere it rallies the laggard troop, it has its stations where it\nmeditates, in the presence of some splendid Canaan suddenly unveiled on\nits horizon, it has its nights when it sleeps; and it is one of the\npoignant anxieties of the thinker that he sees the shadow resting on\nthe human soul, and that he gropes in darkness without being able to\nawaken that slumbering Progress.\n\n“God is dead, perhaps,” said Gerard de Nerval one day to the writer of\nthese lines, confounding progress with God, and taking the interruption\nof movement for the death of Being.\n\nHe who despairs is in the wrong. Progress infallibly awakes, and, in\nshort, we may say that it marches on, even when it is asleep, for it\nhas increased in size. When we behold it erect once more, we find it\ntaller. To be always peaceful does not depend on progress any more than\nit does on the stream; erect no barriers, cast in no boulders;\nobstacles make water froth and humanity boil. Hence arise troubles; but\nafter these troubles, we recognize the fact that ground has been\ngained. Until order, which is nothing else than universal peace, has\nbeen established, until harmony and unity reign, progress will have\nrevolutions as its halting-places.\n\nWhat, then, is progress? We have just enunciated it; the permanent life\nof the peoples.\n\nNow, it sometimes happens, that the momentary life of individuals\noffers resistance to the eternal life of the human race.\n\nLet us admit without bitterness, that the individual has his distinct\ninterests, and can, without forfeiture, stipulate for his interest, and\ndefend it; the present has its pardonable dose of egotism; momentary\nlife has its rights, and is not bound to sacrifice itself constantly to\nthe future. The generation which is passing in its turn over the earth,\nis not forced to abridge it for the sake of the generations, its equal,\nafter all, who will have their turn later on.—“I exist,” murmurs that\nsome one whose name is All. “I am young and in love, I am old and I\nwish to repose, I am the father of a family, I toil, I prosper, I am\nsuccessful in business, I have houses to lease, I have money in the\ngovernment funds, I am happy, I have a wife and children, I have all\nthis, I desire to live, leave me in peace.”—Hence, at certain hours, a\nprofound cold broods over the magnanimous vanguard of the human race.\n\nUtopia, moreover, we must admit, quits its radiant sphere when it makes\nwar. It, the truth of to-morrow, borrows its mode of procedure, battle,\nfrom the lie of yesterday. It, the future, behaves like the past. It,\npure idea, becomes a deed of violence. It complicates its heroism with\na violence for which it is just that it should be held to answer; a\nviolence of occasion and expedient, contrary to principle, and for\nwhich it is fatally punished. The Utopia, insurrection, fights with the\nold military code in its fist; it shoots spies, it executes traitors;\nit suppresses living beings and flings them into unknown darkness. It\nmakes use of death, a serious matter. It seems as though Utopia had no\nlonger any faith in radiance, its irresistible and incorruptible force.\nIt strikes with the sword. Now, no sword is simple. Every blade has two\nedges; he who wounds with the one is wounded with the other.\n\nHaving made this reservation, and made it with all severity, it is\nimpossible for us not to admire, whether they succeed or not, those the\nglorious combatants of the future, the confessors of Utopia. Even when\nthey miscarry, they are worthy of veneration; and it is, perhaps, in\nfailure, that they possess the most majesty. Victory, when it is in\naccord with progress, merits the applause of the people; but a heroic\ndefeat merits their tender compassion. The one is magnificent, the\nother sublime. For our own part, we prefer martyrdom to success. John\nBrown is greater than Washington, and Pisacane is greater than\nGaribaldi.\n\nIt certainly is necessary that some one should take the part of the\nvanquished.\n\nWe are unjust towards these great men who attempt the future, when they\nfail.\n\nRevolutionists are accused of sowing fear abroad. Every barricade seems\na crime. Their theories are incriminated, their aim suspected, their\nulterior motive is feared, their conscience denounced. They are\nreproached with raising, erecting, and heaping up, against the reigning\nsocial state, a mass of miseries, of griefs, of iniquities, of wrongs,\nof despairs, and of tearing from the lowest depths blocks of shadow in\norder therein to embattle themselves and to combat. People shout to\nthem: “You are tearing up the pavements of hell!” They might reply:\n“That is because our barricade is made of good intentions.”\n\n\nThe best thing, assuredly, is the pacific solution. In short, let us\nagree that when we behold the pavement, we think of the bear, and it is\na good will which renders society uneasy. But it depends on society to\nsave itself, it is to its own good will that we make our appeal. No\nviolent remedy is necessary. To study evil amiably, to prove its\nexistence, then to cure it. It is to this that we invite it.\n\nHowever that may be, even when fallen, above all when fallen, these\nmen, who at every point of the universe, with their eyes fixed on\nFrance, are striving for the grand work with the inflexible logic of\nthe ideal, are august; they give their life a free offering to\nprogress; they accomplish the will of Providence; they perform a\nreligious act. At the appointed hour, with as much disinterestedness as\nan actor who answers to his cue, in obedience to the divine\nstage-manager, they enter the tomb. And this hopeless combat, this\nstoical disappearance they accept in order to bring about the supreme\nand universal consequences, the magnificent and irresistibly human\nmovement begun on the 14th of July, 1789; these soldiers are priests.\nThe French revolution is an act of God.\n\nMoreover, there are, and it is proper to add this distinction to the\ndistinctions already pointed out in another chapter,—there are accepted\nrevolutions, revolutions which are called revolutions; there are\nrefused revolutions, which are called riots.\n\nAn insurrection which breaks out, is an idea which is passing its\nexamination before the people. If the people lets fall a black ball,\nthe idea is dried fruit; the insurrection is a mere skirmish.\n\nWaging war at every summons and every time that Utopia desires it, is\nnot the thing for the peoples. Nations have not always and at every\nhour the temperament of heroes and martyrs.\n\nThey are positive. _A priori_, insurrection is repugnant to them, in\nthe first place, because it often results in a catastrophe, in the\nsecond place, because it always has an abstraction as its point of\ndeparture.\n\nBecause, and this is a noble thing, it is always for the ideal, and for\nthe ideal alone, that those who sacrifice themselves do thus sacrifice\nthemselves. An insurrection is an enthusiasm. Enthusiasm may wax wroth;\nhence the appeal to arms. But every insurrection, which aims at a\ngovernment or a régime, aims higher. Thus, for instance, and we insist\nupon it, what the chiefs of the insurrection of 1832, and, in\nparticular, the young enthusiasts of the Rue de la Chanvrerie were\ncombating, was not precisely Louis Philippe. The majority of them, when\ntalking freely, did justice to this king who stood midway between\nmonarchy and revolution; no one hated him. But they attacked the\nyounger branch of the divine right in Louis Philippe as they had\nattacked its elder branch in Charles X.; and that which they wished to\noverturn in overturning royalty in France, was, as we have explained,\nthe usurpation of man over man, and of privilege over right in the\nentire universe. Paris without a king has as result the world without\ndespots. This is the manner in which they reasoned. Their aim was\ndistant no doubt, vague perhaps, and it retreated in the face of their\nefforts; but it was great.\n\nThus it is. And we sacrifice ourselves for these visions, which are\nalmost always illusions for the sacrificed, but illusions with which,\nafter all, the whole of human certainty is mingled. We throw ourselves\ninto these tragic affairs and become intoxicated with that which we are\nabout to do. Who knows? We may succeed. We are few in number, we have a\nwhole army arrayed against us; but we are defending right, the natural\nlaw, the sovereignty of each one over himself from which no abdication\nis possible, justice and truth, and in case of need, we die like the\nthree hundred Spartans. We do not think of Don Quixote but of Leonidas.\nAnd we march straight before us, and once pledged, we do not draw back,\nand we rush onwards with head held low, cherishing as our hope an\nunprecedented victory, revolution completed, progress set free again,\nthe aggrandizement of the human race, universal deliverance; and in the\nevent of the worst, Thermopylæ.\n\nThese passages of arms for the sake of progress often suffer shipwreck,\nand we have just explained why. The crowd is restive in the presence of\nthe impulses of paladins. Heavy masses, the multitudes which are\nfragile because of their very weight, fear adventures; and there is a\ntouch of adventure in the ideal.\n\nMoreover, and we must not forget this, interests which are not very\nfriendly to the ideal and the sentimental are in the way. Sometimes the\nstomach paralyzes the heart.\n\nThe grandeur and beauty of France lies in this, that she takes less\nfrom the stomach than other nations: she more easily knots the rope\nabout her loins. She is the first awake, the last asleep. She marches\nforwards. She is a seeker.\n\nThis arises from the fact that she is an artist.\n\nThe ideal is nothing but the culminating point of logic, the same as\nthe beautiful is nothing but the summit of the true. Artistic peoples\nare also consistent peoples. To love beauty is to see the light. That\nis why the torch of Europe, that is to say of civilization, was first\nborne by Greece, who passed it on to Italy, who handed it on to France.\nDivine, illuminating nations of scouts! _Vitælampada tradunt_.\n\nIt is an admirable thing that the poetry of a people is the element of\nits progress. The amount of civilization is measured by the quantity of\nimagination. Only, a civilizing people should remain a manly people.\nCorinth, yes; Sybaris, no. Whoever becomes effeminate makes himself a\nbastard. He must be neither a dilettante nor a virtuoso: but he must be\nartistic. In the matter of civilization, he must not refine, but he\nmust sublime. On this condition, one gives to the human race the\npattern of the ideal.\n\nThe modern ideal has its type in art, and its means is science. It is\nthrough science that it will realize that august vision of the poets,\nthe socially beautiful. Eden will be reconstructed by A+B. At the point\nwhich civilization has now reached, the exact is a necessary element of\nthe splendid, and the artistic sentiment is not only served, but\ncompleted by the scientific organ; dreams must be calculated. Art,\nwhich is the conqueror, should have for support science, which is the\nwalker; the solidity of the creature which is ridden is of importance.\nThe modern spirit is the genius of Greece with the genius of India as\nits vehicle; Alexander on the elephant.\n\nRaces which are petrified in dogma or demoralized by lucre are unfit to\nguide civilization. Genuflection before the idol or before money wastes\naway the muscles which walk and the will which advances. Hieratic or\nmercantile absorption lessens a people’s power of radiance, lowers its\nhorizon by lowering its level, and deprives it of that intelligence, at\nonce both human and divine of the universal goal, which makes\nmissionaries of nations. Babylon has no ideal; Carthage has no ideal.\nAthens and Rome have and keep, throughout all the nocturnal darkness of\nthe centuries, halos of civilization.\n\nFrance is in the same quality of race as Greece and Italy. She is\nAthenian in the matter of beauty, and Roman in her greatness. Moreover,\nshe is good. She gives herself. Oftener than is the case with other\nraces, is she in the humor for self-devotion and sacrifice. Only, this\nhumor seizes upon her, and again abandons her. And therein lies the\ngreat peril for those who run when she desires only to walk, or who\nwalk on when she desires to halt. France has her relapses into\nmaterialism, and, at certain instants, the ideas which obstruct that\nsublime brain have no longer anything which recalls French greatness\nand are of the dimensions of a Missouri or a South Carolina. What is to\nbe done in such a case? The giantess plays at being a dwarf; immense\nFrance has her freaks of pettiness. That is all.\n\nTo this there is nothing to say. Peoples, like planets, possess the\nright to an eclipse. And all is well, provided that the light returns\nand that the eclipse does not degenerate into night. Dawn and\nresurrection are synonymous. The reappearance of the light is identical\nwith the persistence of the _I_.\n\nLet us state these facts calmly. Death on the barricade or the tomb in\nexile, is an acceptable occasion for devotion. The real name of\ndevotion is disinterestedness. Let the abandoned allow themselves to be\nabandoned, let the exiled allow themselves to be exiled, and let us\nconfine ourselves to entreating great nations not to retreat too far,\nwhen they do retreat. One must not push too far in descent under\npretext of a return to reason.\n\nMatter exists, the minute exists, interest exists, the stomach exists;\nbut the stomach must not be the sole wisdom. The life of the moment has\nits rights, we admit, but permanent life has its rights also. Alas! the\nfact that one is mounted does not preclude a fall. This can be seen in\nhistory more frequently than is desirable: A nation is great, it tastes\nthe ideal, then it bites the mire, and finds it good; and if it be\nasked how it happens that it has abandoned Socrates for Falstaff, it\nreplies: “Because I love statesmen.”\n\n\nOne word more before returning to our subject, the conflict.\n\nA battle like the one which we are engaged in describing is nothing\nelse than a convulsion towards the ideal. Progress trammelled is\nsickly, and is subject to these tragic epilepsies. With that malady of\nprogress, civil war, we have been obliged to come in contact in our\npassage. This is one of the fatal phases, at once act and entr’acte of\nthat drama whose pivot is a social condemnation, and whose veritable\ntitle is _Progress_.\n\nProgress!\n\nThe cry to which we frequently give utterance is our whole thought;\nand, at the point of this drama which we have now reached, the idea\nwhich it contains having still more than one trial to undergo, it is,\nperhaps, permitted to us, if not to lift the veil from it, to at least\nallow its light to shine through.\n\nThe book which the reader has under his eye at this moment is, from one\nend to the other, as a whole and in detail, whatever may be its\nintermittences, exceptions and faults, the march from evil to good,\nfrom the unjust to the just, from night to day, from appetite to\nconscience, from rottenness to life, from hell to heaven, from\nnothingness to God. Point of departure: matter; point of arrival: the\nsoul. The hydra at the beginning, the angel at the end.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI—THE HEROES\n\n\nAll at once, the drum beat the charge.\n\nThe attack was a hurricane. On the evening before, in the darkness, the\nbarricade had been approached silently, as by a boa. Now, in broad\ndaylight, in that widening street, surprise was decidedly impossible,\nrude force had, moreover, been unmasked, the cannon had begun the roar,\nthe army hurled itself on the barricade. Fury now became skill. A\npowerful detachment of infantry of the line, broken at regular\nintervals, by the National Guard and the Municipal Guard on foot, and\nsupported by serried masses which could be heard though not seen,\ndebauched into the street at a run, with drums beating, trumpets\nbraying, bayonets levelled, the sappers at their head, and,\nimperturbable under the projectiles, charged straight for the barricade\nwith the weight of a brazen beam against a wall.\n\nThe wall held firm.\n\nThe insurgents fired impetuously. The barricade once scaled had a mane\nof lightning flashes. The assault was so furious, that for one moment,\nit was inundated with assailants; but it shook off the soldiers as the\nlion shakes off the dogs, and it was only covered with besiegers as the\ncliff is covered with foam, to reappear, a moment later, beetling,\nblack and formidable.\n\nThe column, forced to retreat, remained massed in the street,\nunprotected but terrible, and replied to the redoubt with a terrible\ndischarge of musketry. Any one who has seen fireworks will recall the\nsheaf formed of interlacing lightnings which is called a bouquet. Let\nthe reader picture to himself this bouquet, no longer vertical but\nhorizontal, bearing a bullet, buckshot or a biscaïen at the tip of each\none of its jets of flame, and picking off dead men one after another\nfrom its clusters of lightning. The barricade was underneath it.\n\nOn both sides, the resolution was equal. The bravery exhibited there\nwas almost barbarous and was complicated with a sort of heroic ferocity\nwhich began by the sacrifice of self.\n\nThis was the epoch when a National Guardsman fought like a Zouave. The\ntroop wished to make an end of it, insurrection was desirous of\nfighting. The acceptance of the death agony in the flower of youth and\nin the flush of health turns intrepidity into frenzy. In this fray,\neach one underwent the broadening growth of the death hour. The street\nwas strewn with corpses.\n\nThe barricade had Enjolras at one of its extremities and Marius at the\nother. Enjolras, who carried the whole barricade in his head, reserved\nand sheltered himself; three soldiers fell, one after the other, under\nhis embrasure, without having even seen him; Marius fought unprotected.\nHe made himself a target. He stood with more than half his body above\nthe breastworks. There is no more violent prodigal than the avaricious\nman who takes the bit in his teeth; there is no man more terrible in\naction than a dreamer. Marius was formidable and pensive. In battle he\nwas as in a dream. One would have pronounced him a phantom engaged in\nfiring a gun.\n\nThe insurgents’ cartridges were giving out; but not their sarcasms. In\nthis whirlwind of the sepulchre in which they stood, they laughed.\n\nCourfeyrac was bareheaded.\n\n“What have you done with your hat?” Bossuet asked him.\n\nCourfeyrac replied:\n\n“They have finally taken it away from me with cannon-balls.”\n\n\nOr they uttered haughty comments.\n\n“Can any one understand,” exclaimed Feuilly bitterly, “those men,—[and\nhe cited names, well-known names, even celebrated names, some belonging\nto the old army]—who had promised to join us, and taken an oath to aid\nus, and who had pledged their honor to it, and who are our generals,\nand who abandon us!”\n\n\nAnd Combeferre restricted himself to replying with a grave smile.\n\n“There are people who observe the rules of honor as one observes the\nstars, from a great distance.”\n\n\nThe interior of the barricade was so strewn with torn cartridges that\none would have said that there had been a snowstorm.\n\nThe assailants had numbers in their favor; the insurgents had position.\nThey were at the top of a wall, and they thundered point-blank upon the\nsoldiers tripping over the dead and wounded and entangled in the\nescarpment. This barricade, constructed as it was and admirably\nbuttressed, was really one of those situations where a handful of men\nhold a legion in check. Nevertheless, the attacking column, constantly\nrecruited and enlarged under the shower of bullets, drew inexorably\nnearer, and now, little by little, step by step, but surely, the army\nclosed in around the barricade as the vice grasps the wine-press.\n\nOne assault followed another. The horror of the situation kept\nincreasing.\n\nThen there burst forth on that heap of paving-stones, in that Rue de la\nChanvrerie, a battle worthy of a wall of Troy. These haggard, ragged,\nexhausted men, who had had nothing to eat for four and twenty hours,\nwho had not slept, who had but a few more rounds to fire, who were\nfumbling in their pockets which had been emptied of cartridges, nearly\nall of whom were wounded, with head or arm bandaged with black and\nblood-stained linen, with holes in their clothes from which the blood\ntrickled, and who were hardly armed with poor guns and notched swords,\nbecame Titans. The barricade was ten times attacked, approached,\nassailed, scaled, and never captured.\n\nIn order to form an idea of this struggle, it is necessary to imagine\nfire set to a throng of terrible courages, and then to gaze at the\nconflagration. It was not a combat, it was the interior of a furnace;\nthere mouths breathed the flame; there countenances were extraordinary.\nThe human form seemed impossible there, the combatants flamed forth\nthere, and it was formidable to behold the going and coming in that red\nglow of those salamanders of the fray.\n\nThe successive and simultaneous scenes of this grand slaughter we\nrenounce all attempts at depicting. The epic alone has the right to\nfill twelve thousand verses with a battle.\n\nOne would have pronounced this that hell of Brahmanism, the most\nredoubtable of the seventeen abysses, which the Veda calls the Forest\nof Swords.\n\nThey fought hand to hand, foot to foot, with pistol shots, with blows\nof the sword, with their fists, at a distance, close at hand, from\nabove, from below, from everywhere, from the roofs of the houses, from\nthe windows of the wine-shop, from the cellar windows, whither some had\ncrawled. They were one against sixty.\n\nThe façade of Corinthe, half demolished, was hideous. The window,\ntattooed with grape-shot, had lost glass and frame and was nothing now\nbut a shapeless hole, tumultuously blocked with paving-stones.\n\nBossuet was killed; Feuilly was killed; Courfeyrac was killed;\nCombeferre, transfixed by three blows from a bayonet in the breast at\nthe moment when he was lifting up a wounded soldier, had only time to\ncast a glance to heaven when he expired.\n\nMarius, still fighting, was so riddled with wounds, particularly in the\nhead, that his countenance disappeared beneath the blood, and one would\nhave said that his face was covered with a red kerchief.\n\nEnjolras alone was not struck. When he had no longer any weapon, he\nreached out his hands to right and left and an insurgent thrust some\narm or other into his fist. All he had left was the stumps of four\nswords; one more than François I. at Marignan. Homer says: “Diomedes\ncuts the throat of Axylus, son of Teuthranis, who dwelt in happy\nArisba; Euryalus, son of Mecistæus, exterminates Dresos and Opheltios,\nEsepius, and that Pedasus whom the naiad Abarbarea bore to the\nblameless Bucolion; Ulysses overthrows Pidytes of Percosius;\nAntilochus, Ablerus; Polypætes, Astyalus; Polydamas, Otos, of Cyllene;\nand Teucer, Aretaon. Meganthios dies under the blows of Euripylus’\npike. Agamemnon, king of the heroes, flings to earth Elatos, born in\nthe rocky city which is laved by the sounding river Satnoïs.” In our\nold poems of exploits, Esplandian attacks the giant marquis Swantibore\nwith a cobbler’s shoulder-stick of fire, and the latter defends himself\nby stoning the hero with towers which he plucks up by the roots. Our\nancient mural frescoes show us the two Dukes of Bretagne and Bourbon,\narmed, emblazoned and crested in war-like guise, on horseback and\napproaching each other, their battle-axes in hand, masked with iron,\ngloved with iron, booted with iron, the one caparisoned in ermine, the\nother draped in azure: Bretagne with his lion between the two horns of\nhis crown, Bourbon helmeted with a monster fleur de lys on his visor.\nBut, in order to be superb, it is not necessary to wear, like Yvon, the\nducal morion, to have in the fist, like Esplandian, a living flame, or,\nlike Phyles, father of Polydamas, to have brought back from Ephyra a\ngood suit of mail, a present from the king of men, Euphetes; it\nsuffices to give one’s life for a conviction or a loyalty. This\ningenuous little soldier, yesterday a peasant of Bauce or Limousin, who\nprowls with his clasp-knife by his side, around the children’s nurses\nin the Luxembourg garden, this pale young student bent over a piece of\nanatomy or a book, a blond youth who shaves his beard with\nscissors,—take both of them, breathe upon them with a breath of duty,\nplace them face to face in the Carrefour Boucherat or in the blind\nalley Planche-Mibray, and let the one fight for his flag, and the other\nfor his ideal, and let both of them imagine that they are fighting for\ntheir country; the struggle will be colossal; and the shadow which this\nraw recruit and this sawbones in conflict will produce in that grand\nepic field where humanity is striving, will equal the shadow cast by\nMegaryon, King of Lycia, tiger-filled, crushing in his embrace the\nimmense body of Ajax, equal to the gods.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII—FOOT TO FOOT\n\n\nWhen there were no longer any of the leaders left alive, except\nEnjolras and Marius at the two extremities of the barricade, the\ncentre, which had so long sustained Courfeyrac, Joly, Bossuet, Feuilly\nand Combeferre, gave way. The cannon, though it had not effected a\npracticable breach, had made a rather large hollow in the middle of the\nredoubt; there, the summit of the wall had disappeared before the\nballs, and had crumbled away; and the rubbish which had fallen, now\ninside, now outside, had, as it accumulated, formed two piles in the\nnature of slopes on the two sides of the barrier, one on the inside,\nthe other on the outside. The exterior slope presented an inclined\nplane to the attack.\n\nA final assault was there attempted, and this assault succeeded. The\nmass bristling with bayonets and hurled forward at a run, came up with\nirresistible force, and the serried front of battle of the attacking\ncolumn made its appearance through the smoke on the crest of the\nbattlements. This time, it was decisive. The group of insurgents who\nwere defending the centre retreated in confusion.\n\nThen the gloomy love of life awoke once more in some of them. Many,\nfinding themselves under the muzzles of this forest of guns, did not\nwish to die. This is a moment when the instinct of self-preservation\nemits howls, when the beast reappears in men. They were hemmed in by\nthe lofty, six-story house which formed the background of their\nredoubt. This house might prove their salvation. The building was\nbarricaded, and walled, as it were, from top to bottom. Before the\ntroops of the line had reached the interior of the redoubt, there was\ntime for a door to open and shut, the space of a flash of lightning was\nsufficient for that, and the door of that house, suddenly opened a\ncrack and closed again instantly, was life for these despairing men.\nBehind this house, there were streets, possible flight, space. They set\nto knocking at that door with the butts of their guns, and with kicks,\nshouting, calling, entreating, wringing their hands. No one opened.\nFrom the little window on the third floor, the head of the dead man\ngazed down upon them.\n\nBut Enjolras and Marius, and the seven or eight rallied about them,\nsprang forward and protected them. Enjolras had shouted to the\nsoldiers: “Don’t advance!” and as an officer had not obeyed, Enjolras\nhad killed the officer. He was now in the little inner court of the\nredoubt, with his back planted against the Corinthe building, a sword\nin one hand, a rifle in the other, holding open the door of the\nwine-shop which he barred against assailants. He shouted to the\ndesperate men:—“There is but one door open; this one.”—And shielding\nthem with his body, and facing an entire battalion alone, he made them\npass in behind him. All precipitated themselves thither. Enjolras,\nexecuting with his rifle, which he now used like a cane, what\nsingle-stick players call a “covered rose” round his head, levelled the\nbayonets around and in front of him, and was the last to enter; and\nthen ensued a horrible moment, when the soldiers tried to make their\nway in, and the insurgents strove to bar them out. The door was slammed\nwith such violence, that, as it fell back into its frame, it showed the\nfive fingers of a soldier who had been clinging to it, cut off and\nglued to the post.\n\nMarius remained outside. A shot had just broken his collar bone, he\nfelt that he was fainting and falling. At that moment, with eyes\nalready shut, he felt the shock of a vigorous hand seizing him, and the\nswoon in which his senses vanished, hardly allowed him time for the\nthought, mingled with a last memory of Cosette:—“I am taken prisoner. I\nshall be shot.”\n\n\nEnjolras, not seeing Marius among those who had taken refuge in the\nwine-shop, had the same idea. But they had reached a moment when each\nman has not the time to meditate on his own death. Enjolras fixed the\nbar across the door, and bolted it, and double-locked it with key and\nchain, while those outside were battering furiously at it, the soldiers\nwith the butts of their muskets, the sappers with their axes. The\nassailants were grouped about that door. The siege of the wine-shop was\nnow beginning.\n\nThe soldiers, we will observe, were full of wrath.\n\nThe death of the artillery-sergeant had enraged them, and then, a still\nmore melancholy circumstance. During the few hours which had preceded\nthe attack, it had been reported among them that the insurgents were\nmutilating their prisoners, and that there was the headless body of a\nsoldier in the wine-shop. This sort of fatal rumor is the usual\naccompaniment of civil wars, and it was a false report of this kind\nwhich, later on, produced the catastrophe of the Rue Transnonain.\n\nWhen the door was barricaded, Enjolras said to the others:\n\n“Let us sell our lives dearly.”\n\n\nThen he approached the table on which lay Mabeuf and Gavroche. Beneath\nthe black cloth two straight and rigid forms were visible, one large,\nthe other small, and the two faces were vaguely outlined beneath the\ncold folds of the shroud. A hand projected from beneath the winding\nsheet and hung near the floor. It was that of the old man.\n\nEnjolras bent down and kissed that venerable hand, just as he had\nkissed his brow on the preceding evening.\n\nThese were the only two kisses which he had bestowed in the course of\nhis life.\n\nLet us abridge the tale. The barricade had fought like a gate of\nThebes; the wine-shop fought like a house of Saragossa. These\nresistances are dogged. No quarter. No flag of truce possible. Men are\nwilling to die, provided their opponent will kill them.\n\nWhen Suchet says:—“Capitulate,”—Palafox replies: “After the war with\ncannon, the war with knives.” Nothing was lacking in the capture by\nassault of the Hucheloup wine-shop; neither paving-stones raining from\nthe windows and the roof on the besiegers and exasperating the soldiers\nby crushing them horribly, nor shots fired from the attic-windows and\nthe cellar, nor the fury of attack, nor, finally, when the door\nyielded, the frenzied madness of extermination. The assailants, rushing\ninto the wine-shop, their feet entangled in the panels of the door\nwhich had been beaten in and flung on the ground, found not a single\ncombatant there. The spiral staircase, hewn asunder with the axe, lay\nin the middle of the tap-room, a few wounded men were just breathing\ntheir last, every one who was not killed was on the first floor, and\nfrom there, through the hole in the ceiling, which had formed the\nentrance of the stairs, a terrific fire burst forth. It was the last of\ntheir cartridges. When they were exhausted, when these formidable men\non the point of death had no longer either powder or ball, each grasped\nin his hands two of the bottles which Enjolras had reserved, and of\nwhich we have spoken, and held the scaling party in check with these\nfrightfully fragile clubs. They were bottles of aquafortis.\n\nWe relate these gloomy incidents of carnage as they occurred. The\nbesieged man, alas! converts everything into a weapon. Greek fire did\nnot disgrace Archimedes, boiling pitch did not disgrace Bayard. All war\nis a thing of terror, and there is no choice in it. The musketry of the\nbesiegers, though confined and embarrassed by being directed from below\nupwards, was deadly. The rim of the hole in the ceiling was speedily\nsurrounded by heads of the slain, whence dripped long, red and smoking\nstreams, the uproar was indescribable; a close and burning smoke almost\nproduced night over this combat. Words are lacking to express horror\nwhen it has reached this pitch. There were no longer men in this\nconflict, which was now infernal. They were no longer giants matched\nwith colossi. It resembled Milton and Dante rather than Homer. Demons\nattacked, spectres resisted.\n\nIt was heroism become monstrous.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII—ORESTES FASTING AND PYLADES DRUNK\n\n\nAt length, by dint of mounting on each other’s backs, aiding themselves\nwith the skeleton of the staircase, climbing up the walls, clinging to\nthe ceiling, slashing away at the very brink of the trap-door, the last\none who offered resistance, a score of assailants, soldiers, National\nGuardsmen, municipal guardsmen, in utter confusion, the majority\ndisfigured by wounds in the face during that redoubtable ascent,\nblinded by blood, furious, rendered savage, made an irruption into the\napartment on the first floor. There they found only one man still on\nhis feet, Enjolras. Without cartridges, without sword, he had nothing\nin his hand now but the barrel of his gun whose stock he had broken\nover the head of those who were entering. He had placed the billiard\ntable between his assailants and himself; he had retreated into the\ncorner of the room, and there, with haughty eye, and head borne high,\nwith this stump of a weapon in his hand, he was still so alarming as to\nspeedily create an empty space around him. A cry arose:\n\n“He is the leader! It was he who slew the artillery-man. It is well\nthat he has placed himself there. Let him remain there. Let us shoot\nhim down on the spot.”\n\n\n“Shoot me,” said Enjolras.\n\nAnd flinging away his bit of gun-barrel, and folding his arms, he\noffered his breast.\n\nThe audacity of a fine death always affects men. As soon as Enjolras\nfolded his arms and accepted his end, the din of strife ceased in the\nroom, and this chaos suddenly stilled into a sort of sepulchral\nsolemnity. The menacing majesty of Enjolras disarmed and motionless,\nappeared to oppress this tumult, and this young man, haughty, bloody,\nand charming, who alone had not a wound, who was as indifferent as an\ninvulnerable being, seemed, by the authority of his tranquil glance, to\nconstrain this sinister rabble to kill him respectfully. His beauty, at\nthat moment augmented by his pride, was resplendent, and he was fresh\nand rosy after the fearful four and twenty hours which had just\nelapsed, as though he could no more be fatigued than wounded. It was of\nhim, possibly, that a witness spoke afterwards, before the council of\nwar: “There was an insurgent whom I heard called Apollo.” A National\nGuardsman who had taken aim at Enjolras, lowered his gun, saying: “It\nseems to me that I am about to shoot a flower.”\n\n\nTwelve men formed into a squad in the corner opposite Enjolras, and\nsilently made ready their guns.\n\nThen a sergeant shouted:\n\n“Take aim!”\n\n\nAn officer intervened.\n\n“Wait.”\n\n\nAnd addressing Enjolras:\n\n“Do you wish to have your eyes bandaged?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“Was it you who killed the artillery sergeant?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\nGrantaire had waked up a few moments before.\n\nGrantaire, it will be remembered, had been asleep ever since the\npreceding evening in the upper room of the wine-shop, seated on a chair\nand leaning on the table.\n\nHe realized in its fullest sense the old metaphor of “dead drunk.” The\nhideous potion of absinthe-porter and alcohol had thrown him into a\nlethargy. His table being small, and not suitable for the barricade, he\nhad been left in possession of it. He was still in the same posture,\nwith his breast bent over the table, his head lying flat on his arms,\nsurrounded by glasses, beer-jugs and bottles. His was the overwhelming\nslumber of the torpid bear and the satiated leech. Nothing had had any\neffect upon it, neither the fusillade, nor the cannon-balls, nor the\ngrape-shot which had made its way through the window into the room\nwhere he was. Nor the tremendous uproar of the assault. He merely\nreplied to the cannonade, now and then, by a snore. He seemed to be\nwaiting there for a bullet which should spare him the trouble of\nwaking. Many corpses were strewn around him; and, at the first glance,\nthere was nothing to distinguish him from those profound sleepers of\ndeath.\n\nNoise does not rouse a drunken man; silence awakens him. The fall of\neverything around him only augmented Grantaire’s prostration; the\ncrumbling of all things was his lullaby. The sort of halt which the\ntumult underwent in the presence of Enjolras was a shock to this heavy\nslumber. It had the effect of a carriage going at full speed, which\nsuddenly comes to a dead stop. The persons dozing within it wake up.\nGrantaire rose to his feet with a start, stretched out his arms, rubbed\nhis eyes, stared, yawned, and understood.\n\nA fit of drunkenness reaching its end resembles a curtain which is torn\naway. One beholds, at a single glance and as a whole, all that it has\nconcealed. All suddenly presents itself to the memory; and the drunkard\nwho has known nothing of what has been taking place during the last\ntwenty-four hours, has no sooner opened his eyes than he is perfectly\ninformed. Ideas recur to him with abrupt lucidity; the obliteration of\nintoxication, a sort of steam which has obscured the brain, is\ndissipated, and makes way for the clear and sharply outlined\nimportunity of realities.\n\nRelegated, as he was, to one corner, and sheltered behind the\nbilliard-table, the soldiers whose eyes were fixed on Enjolras, had not\neven noticed Grantaire, and the sergeant was preparing to repeat his\norder: “Take aim!” when all at once, they heard a strong voice shout\nbeside them:\n\n“Long live the Republic! I’m one of them.”\n\n\nGrantaire had risen. The immense gleam of the whole combat which he had\nmissed, and in which he had had no part, appeared in the brilliant\nglance of the transfigured drunken man.\n\nHe repeated: “Long live the Republic!” crossed the room with a firm\nstride and placed himself in front of the guns beside Enjolras.\n\n“Finish both of us at one blow,” said he.\n\nAnd turning gently to Enjolras, he said to him:\n\n“Do you permit it?”\n\n\nEnjolras pressed his hand with a smile.\n\nThis smile was not ended when the report resounded.\n\nEnjolras, pierced by eight bullets, remained leaning against the wall,\nas though the balls had nailed him there. Only, his head was bowed.\n\nGrantaire fell at his feet, as though struck by a thunderbolt.\n\nA few moments later, the soldiers dislodged the last remaining\ninsurgents, who had taken refuge at the top of the house. They fired\ninto the attic through a wooden lattice. They fought under the very\nroof. They flung bodies, some of them still alive, out through the\nwindows. Two light-infantrymen, who tried to lift the shattered\nomnibus, were slain by two shots fired from the attic. A man in a\nblouse was flung down from it, with a bayonet wound in the abdomen, and\nbreathed his last on the ground. A soldier and an insurgent slipped\ntogether on the sloping slates of the roof, and, as they would not\nrelease each other, they fell, clasped in a ferocious embrace. A\nsimilar conflict went on in the cellar. Shouts, shots, a fierce\ntrampling. Then silence. The barricade was captured.\n\nThe soldiers began to search the houses round about, and to pursue the\nfugitives.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV—PRISONER\n\n\nMarius was, in fact, a prisoner.\n\nThe hand which had seized him from behind and whose grasp he had felt\nat the moment of his fall and his loss of consciousness was that of\nJean Valjean.\n\nJean Valjean had taken no other part in the combat than to expose\nhimself in it. Had it not been for him, no one, in that supreme phase\nof agony, would have thought of the wounded. Thanks to him, everywhere\npresent in the carnage, like a providence, those who fell were picked\nup, transported to the tap-room, and cared for. In the intervals, he\nreappeared on the barricade. But nothing which could resemble a blow,\nan attack or even personal defence proceeded from his hands. He held\nhis peace and lent succor. Moreover, he had received only a few\nscratches. The bullets would have none of him. If suicide formed part\nof what he had meditated on coming to this sepulchre, to that spot, he\nhad not succeeded. But we doubt whether he had thought of suicide, an\nirreligious act.\n\nJean Valjean, in the thick cloud of the combat, did not appear to see\nMarius; the truth is, that he never took his eyes from the latter. When\na shot laid Marius low, Jean Valjean leaped forward with the agility of\na tiger, fell upon him as on his prey, and bore him off.\n\nThe whirlwind of the attack was, at that moment, so violently\nconcentrated upon Enjolras and upon the door of the wine-shop, that no\none saw Jean Valjean sustaining the fainting Marius in his arms,\ntraverse the unpaved field of the barricade and disappear behind the\nangle of the Corinthe building.\n\nThe reader will recall this angle which formed a sort of cape on the\nstreet; it afforded shelter from the bullets, the grape-shot, and all\neyes, and a few square feet of space. There is sometimes a chamber\nwhich does not burn in the midst of a conflagration, and in the midst\nof raging seas, beyond a promontory or at the extremity of a blind\nalley of shoals, a tranquil nook. It was in this sort of fold in the\ninterior trapezium of the barricade, that Éponine had breathed her\nlast.\n\nThere Jean Valjean halted, let Marius slide to the ground, placed his\nback against the wall, and cast his eyes about him.\n\nThe situation was alarming.\n\nFor an instant, for two or three perhaps, this bit of wall was a\nshelter, but how was he to escape from this massacre? He recalled the\nanguish which he had suffered in the Rue Polonceau eight years before,\nand in what manner he had contrived to make his escape; it was\ndifficult then, to-day it was impossible. He had before him that deaf\nand implacable house, six stories in height, which appeared to be\ninhabited only by a dead man leaning out of his window; he had on his\nright the rather low barricade, which shut off the Rue de la Petite\nTruanderie; to pass this obstacle seemed easy, but beyond the crest of\nthe barrier a line of bayonets was visible. The troops of the line were\nposted on the watch behind that barricade. It was evident, that to pass\nthe barricade was to go in quest of the fire of the platoon, and that\nany head which should run the risk of lifting itself above the top of\nthat wall of stones would serve as a target for sixty shots. On his\nleft he had the field of battle. Death lurked round the corner of that\nwall.\n\nWhat was to be done?\n\nOnly a bird could have extricated itself from this predicament.\n\nAnd it was necessary to decide on the instant, to devise some\nexpedient, to come to some decision. Fighting was going on a few paces\naway; fortunately, all were raging around a single point, the door of\nthe wine-shop; but if it should occur to one soldier, to one single\nsoldier, to turn the corner of the house, or to attack him on the\nflank, all was over.\n\nJean Valjean gazed at the house facing him, he gazed at the barricade\nat one side of him, then he looked at the ground, with the violence of\nthe last extremity, bewildered, and as though he would have liked to\npierce a hole there with his eyes.\n\nBy dint of staring, something vaguely striking in such an agony began\nto assume form and outline at his feet, as though it had been a power\nof glance which made the thing desired unfold. A few paces distant he\nperceived, at the base of the small barrier so pitilessly guarded and\nwatched on the exterior, beneath a disordered mass of paving-stones\nwhich partly concealed it, an iron grating, placed flat and on a level\nwith the soil. This grating, made of stout, transverse bars, was about\ntwo feet square. The frame of paving-stones which supported it had been\ntorn up, and it was, as it were, unfastened.\n\nThrough the bars a view could be had of a dark aperture, something like\nthe flue of a chimney, or the pipe of a cistern. Jean Valjean darted\nforward. His old art of escape rose to his brain like an illumination.\nTo thrust aside the stones, to raise the grating, to lift Marius, who\nwas as inert as a dead body, upon his shoulders, to descend, with this\nburden on his loins, and with the aid of his elbows and knees into that\nsort of well, fortunately not very deep, to let the heavy trap, upon\nwhich the loosened stones rolled down afresh, fall into its place\nbehind him, to gain his footing on a flagged surface three metres below\nthe surface,—all this was executed like that which one does in dreams,\nwith the strength of a giant and the rapidity of an eagle; this took\nonly a few minutes.\n\nJean Valjean found himself with Marius, who was still unconscious, in a\nsort of long, subterranean corridor.\n\nThere reigned profound peace, absolute silence, night.\n\nThe impression which he had formerly experienced when falling from the\nwall into the convent recurred to him. Only, what he was carrying\nto-day was not Cosette; it was Marius. He could barely hear the\nformidable tumult in the wine-shop, taken by assault, like a vague\nmurmur overhead.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SECOND—THE INTESTINE OF THE LEVIATHAN\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE LAND IMPOVERISHED BY THE SEA\n\n\nParis casts twenty-five millions yearly into the water. And this\nwithout metaphor. How, and in what manner? Day and night. With what\nobject? With no object. With what intention? With no intention. Why?\nFor no reason. By means of what organ? By means of its intestine. What\nis its intestine? The sewer.\n\nTwenty-five millions is the most moderate approximative figure which\nthe valuations of special science have set upon it.\n\nScience, after having long groped about, now knows that the most\nfecundating and the most efficacious of fertilizers is human manure.\nThe Chinese, let us confess it to our shame, knew it before us. Not a\nChinese peasant—it is Eckberg who says this,—goes to town without\nbringing back with him, at the two extremities of his bamboo pole, two\nfull buckets of what we designate as filth. Thanks to human dung, the\nearth in China is still as young as in the days of Abraham. Chinese\nwheat yields a hundred fold of the seed. There is no guano comparable\nin fertility with the detritus of a capital. A great city is the most\nmighty of dung-makers. Certain success would attend the experiment of\nemploying the city to manure the plain. If our gold is manure, our\nmanure, on the other hand, is gold.\n\nWhat is done with this golden manure? It is swept into the abyss.\n\nFleets of vessels are despatched, at great expense, to collect the dung\nof petrels and penguins at the South Pole, and the incalculable element\nof opulence which we have on hand, we send to the sea. All the human\nand animal manure which the world wastes, restored to the land instead\nof being cast into the water, would suffice to nourish the world.\n\nThose heaps of filth at the gate-posts, those tumbrils of mud which\njolt through the street by night, those terrible casks of the street\ndepartment, those fetid drippings of subterranean mire, which the\npavements hide from you,—do you know what they are? They are the meadow\nin flower, the green grass, wild thyme, thyme and sage, they are game,\nthey are cattle, they are the satisfied bellows of great oxen in the\nevening, they are perfumed hay, they are golden wheat, they are the\nbread on your table, they are the warm blood in your veins, they are\nhealth, they are joy, they are life. This is the will of that\nmysterious creation which is transformation on earth and\ntransfiguration in heaven.\n\nRestore this to the great crucible; your abundance will flow forth from\nit. The nutrition of the plains furnishes the nourishment of men.\n\nYou have it in your power to lose this wealth, and to consider me\nridiculous to boot. This will form the master-piece of your ignorance.\n\nStatisticians have calculated that France alone makes a deposit of half\na milliard every year, in the Atlantic, through the mouths of her\nrivers. Note this: with five hundred millions we could pay one quarter\nof the expenses of our budget. The cleverness of man is such that he\nprefers to get rid of these five hundred millions in the gutter. It is\nthe very substance of the people that is carried off, here drop by\ndrop, there wave after wave, the wretched outpour of our sewers into\nthe rivers, and the gigantic collection of our rivers into the ocean.\nEvery hiccough of our sewers costs us a thousand francs. From this\nspring two results, the land impoverished, and the water tainted.\nHunger arising from the furrow, and disease from the stream.\n\nIt is notorious, for example, that at the present hour, the Thames is\npoisoning London.\n\nSo far as Paris is concerned, it has become indispensable of late, to\ntransport the mouths of the sewers downstream, below the last bridge.\n\nA double tubular apparatus, provided with valves and sluices, sucking\nup and driving back, a system of elementary drainage, simple as the\nlungs of a man, and which is already in full working order in many\ncommunities in England, would suffice to conduct the pure water of the\nfields into our cities, and to send back to the fields the rich water\nof the cities, and this easy exchange, the simplest in the world, would\nretain among us the five hundred millions now thrown away. People are\nthinking of other things.\n\nThe process actually in use does evil, with the intention of doing\ngood. The intention is good, the result is melancholy. Thinking to\npurge the city, the population is blanched like plants raised in\ncellars. A sewer is a mistake. When drainage, everywhere, with its\ndouble function, restoring what it takes, shall have replaced the\nsewer, which is a simple impoverishing washing, then, this being\ncombined with the data of a now social economy, the product of the\nearth will be increased tenfold, and the problem of misery will be\nsingularly lightened. Add the suppression of parasitism, and it will be\nsolved.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the public wealth flows away to the river, and\nleakage takes place. Leakage is the word. Europe is being ruined in\nthis manner by exhaustion.\n\nAs for France, we have just cited its figures. Now, Paris contains one\ntwenty-fifth of the total population of France, and Parisian guano\nbeing the richest of all, we understate the truth when we value the\nloss on the part of Paris at twenty-five millions in the half milliard\nwhich France annually rejects. These twenty-five millions, employed in\nassistance and enjoyment, would double the splendor of Paris. The city\nspends them in sewers. So that we may say that Paris’s great\nprodigality, its wonderful festival, its Beaujon folly, its orgy, its\nstream of gold from full hands, its pomp, its luxury, its magnificence,\nis its sewer system.\n\nIt is in this manner that, in the blindness of a poor political\neconomy, we drown and allow to float downstream and to be lost in the\ngulfs the well-being of all. There should be nets at Saint-Cloud for\nthe public fortune.\n\nEconomically considered, the matter can be summed up thus: Paris is a\nspendthrift. Paris, that model city, that patron of well-arranged\ncapitals, of which every nation strives to possess a copy, that\nmetropolis of the ideal, that august country of the initiative, of\nimpulse and of effort, that centre and that dwelling of minds, that\nnation-city, that hive of the future, that marvellous combination of\nBabylon and Corinth, would make a peasant of the Fo-Kian shrug his\nshoulders, from the point of view which we have just indicated.\n\nImitate Paris and you will ruin yourselves.\n\nMoreover, and particularly in this immemorial and senseless waste,\nParis is itself an imitator.\n\nThese surprising exhibitions of stupidity are not novel; this is no\nyoung folly. The ancients did like the moderns. “The sewers of Rome,”\nsays Liebig, “have absorbed all the well-being of the Roman peasant.”\nWhen the Campagna of Rome was ruined by the Roman sewer, Rome exhausted\nItaly, and when she had put Italy in her sewer, she poured in Sicily,\nthen Sardinia, then Africa. The sewer of Rome has engulfed the world.\nThis cesspool offered its engulfment to the city and the universe.\n_Urbi et orbi_. Eternal city, unfathomable sewer.\n\nRome sets the example for these things as well as for others.\n\nParis follows this example with all the stupidity peculiar to\nintelligent towns.\n\nFor the requirements of the operation upon the subject of which we have\njust explained our views, Paris has beneath it another Paris; a Paris\nof sewers; which has its streets, its crossroads, its squares, its\nblind-alleys, its arteries, and its circulation, which is of mire and\nminus the human form.\n\nFor nothing must be flattered, not even a great people; where there is\neverything there is also ignominy by the side of sublimity; and, if\nParis contains Athens, the city of light, Tyre, the city of might,\nSparta, the city of virtue, Nineveh, the city of marvels, it also\ncontains Lutetia, the city of mud.\n\nHowever, the stamp of its power is there also, and the Titanic sink of\nParis realizes, among monuments, that strange ideal realized in\nhumanity by some men like Macchiavelli, Bacon and Mirabeau, grandiose\nvileness.\n\nThe sub-soil of Paris, if the eye could penetrate its surface, would\npresent the aspect of a colossal madrepore. A sponge has no more\npartitions and ducts than the mound of earth for a circuit of six\nleagues round about, on which rests the great and ancient city. Not to\nmention its catacombs, which are a separate cellar, not to mention the\ninextricable trellis-work of gas pipes, without reckoning the vast\ntubular system for the distribution of fresh water which ends in the\npillar fountains, the sewers alone form a tremendous, shadowy network\nunder the two banks; a labyrinth which has its slope for its guiding\nthread.\n\nThere appears, in the humid mist, the rat which seems the product to\nwhich Paris has given birth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—ANCIENT HISTORY OF THE SEWER\n\n\nLet the reader imagine Paris lifted off like a cover, the subterranean\nnetwork of sewers, from a bird’s-eye view, will outline on the banks a\nspecies of large branch grafted on the river. On the right bank, the\nbelt sewer will form the trunk of this branch, the secondary ducts will\nform the branches, and those without exit the twigs.\n\nThis figure is but a summary one and half exact, the right angle, which\nis the customary angle of this species of subterranean ramifications,\nbeing very rare in vegetation.\n\nA more accurate image of this strange geometrical plan can be formed by\nsupposing that one is viewing some eccentric oriental alphabet, as\nintricate as a thicket, against a background of shadows, and the\nmisshapen letters should be welded one to another in apparent\nconfusion, and as at haphazard, now by their angles, again by their\nextremities.\n\nSinks and sewers played a great part in the Middle Ages, in the Lower\nEmpire and in the Orient of old. The masses regarded these beds of\ndecomposition, these monstrous cradles of death, with a fear that was\nalmost religious. The vermin ditch of Benares is no less conducive to\ngiddiness than the lions’ ditch of Babylon. Teglath-Phalasar, according\nto the rabbinical books, swore by the sink of Nineveh. It was from the\nsewer of Münster that John of Leyden produced his false moon, and it\nwas from the cesspool of Kekscheb that oriental menalchme, Mokanna, the\nveiled prophet of Khorassan, caused his false sun to emerge.\n\nThe history of men is reflected in the history of sewers. The\nGermoniæ58 narrated Rome. The sewer of Paris has been an ancient and\nformidable thing. It has been a sepulchre, it has served as an asylum.\nCrime, intelligence, social protest, liberty of conscience, thought,\ntheft, all that human laws persecute or have persecuted, is hidden in\nthat hole; the _maillotins_ in the fourteenth century, the _tire-laine_\nof the fifteenth, the Huguenots in the sixteenth, Morin’s _illuminated_\nin the seventeenth, the _chauffeurs_ [brigands] in the eighteenth. A\nhundred years ago, the nocturnal blow of the dagger emerged thence, the\npickpocket in danger slipped thither; the forest had its cave, Paris\nhad its sewer. Vagrancy, that Gallic _picareria_, accepted the sewer as\nthe adjunct of the Cour des Miracles, and at evening, it returned\nthither, fierce and sly, through the Maubuée outlet, as into a\nbed-chamber.\n\nIt was quite natural, that those who had the blind-alley Vide-Gousset,\n[Empty-Pocket] or the Rue Coupe-Gorge [Cut-Throat], for the scene of\ntheir daily labor, should have for their domicile by night the culvert\nof the Chemin-Vert, or the catch basin of Hurepoix. Hence a throng of\nsouvenirs. All sorts of phantoms haunt these long, solitary corridors;\neverywhere is putrescence and miasma; here and there are\nbreathing-holes, where Villon within converses with Rabelais without.\n\nThe sewer in ancient Paris is the rendezvous of all exhaustions and of\nall attempts. Political economy therein spies a detritus, social\nphilosophy there beholds a residuum.\n\nThe sewer is the conscience of the city. Everything there converges and\nconfronts everything else. In that livid spot there are shades, but\nthere are no longer any secrets. Each thing bears its true form, or at\nleast, its definitive form. The mass of filth has this in its favor,\nthat it is not a liar. Ingenuousness has taken refuge there. The mask\nof Basil is to be found there, but one beholds its cardboard and its\nstrings and the inside as well as the outside, and it is accentuated by\nhonest mud. Scapin’s false nose is its next-door neighbor. All the\nuncleannesses of civilization, once past their use, fall into this\ntrench of truth, where the immense social sliding ends. They are there\nengulfed, but they display themselves there. This mixture is a\nconfession. There, no more false appearances, no plastering over is\npossible, filth removes its shirt, absolute denudation puts to the rout\nall illusions and mirages, there is nothing more except what really\nexists, presenting the sinister form of that which is coming to an end.\nThere, the bottom of a bottle indicates drunkenness, a basket-handle\ntells a tale of domesticity; there the core of an apple which has\nentertained literary opinions becomes an apple-core once more; the\neffigy on the big sou becomes frankly covered with verdigris, Caiphas’\nspittle meets Falstaff’s puking, the louis-d’or which comes from the\ngaming-house jostles the nail whence hangs the rope’s end of the\nsuicide. A livid fœtus rolls along, enveloped in the spangles which\ndanced at the Opera last Shrove-Tuesday, a cap which has pronounced\njudgment on men wallows beside a mass of rottenness which was formerly\nMargoton’s petticoat; it is more than fraternization, it is equivalent\nto addressing each other as _thou_. All which was formerly rouged, is\nwashed free. The last veil is torn away. A sewer is a cynic. It tells\neverything.\n\nThe sincerity of foulness pleases us, and rests the soul. When one has\npassed one’s time in enduring upon earth the spectacle of the great\nairs which reasons of state, the oath, political sagacity, human\njustice, professional probity, the austerities of situation,\nincorruptible robes all assume, it solaces one to enter a sewer and to\nbehold the mire which befits it.\n\nThis is instructive at the same time. We have just said that history\npasses through the sewer. The Saint-Barthélemys filter through there,\ndrop by drop, between the paving-stones. Great public assassinations,\npolitical and religious butcheries, traverse this underground passage\nof civilization, and thrust their corpses there. For the eye of the\nthinker, all historic murderers are to be found there, in that hideous\npenumbra, on their knees, with a scrap of their winding-sheet for an\napron, dismally sponging out their work. Louis XI. is there with\nTristan, François I. with Duprat, Charles IX. is there with his mother,\nRichelieu is there with Louis XIII., Louvois is there, Letellier is\nthere, Hébert and Maillard are there, scratching the stones, and trying\nto make the traces of their actions disappear. Beneath these vaults one\nhears the brooms of spectres. One there breathes the enormous fetidness\nof social catastrophes. One beholds reddish reflections in the corners.\nThere flows a terrible stream, in which bloody hands have been washed.\n\nThe social observer should enter these shadows. They form a part of his\nlaboratory. Philosophy is the microscope of the thought. Everything\ndesires to flee from it, but nothing escapes it. Tergiversation is\nuseless. What side of oneself does one display in evasions? the\nshameful side. Philosophy pursues with its glance, probes the evil, and\ndoes not permit it to escape into nothingness. In the obliteration of\nthings which disappear, in the watching of things which vanish, it\nrecognizes all. It reconstructs the purple from the rag, and the woman\nfrom the scrap of her dress. From the cesspool, it reconstitutes the\ncity; from mud, it reconstructs manners; from the potsherd it infers\nthe amphora or the jug. By the imprint of a finger-nail on a piece of\nparchment, it recognizes the difference which separates the Jewry of\nthe Judengasse from the Jewry of the Ghetto. It re-discovers in what\nremains that which has been, good, evil, the true, the blood-stain of\nthe palace, the ink-blot of the cavern, the drop of sweat from the\nbrothel, trials undergone, temptations welcomed, orgies cast forth, the\nturn which characters have taken as they became abased, the trace of\nprostitution in souls of which their grossness rendered them capable,\nand on the vesture of the porters of Rome the mark of Messalina’s\nelbowing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—BRUNESEAU\n\n\nThe sewer of Paris in the Middle Ages was legendary. In the sixteenth\ncentury, Henri II. attempted a bore, which failed. Not a hundred years\nago, the cesspool, Mercier attests the fact, was abandoned to itself,\nand fared as best it might.\n\nSuch was this ancient Paris, delivered over to quarrels, to indecision,\nand to gropings. It was tolerably stupid for a long time. Later on, ’89\nshowed how understanding comes to cities. But in the good, old times,\nthe capital had not much head. It did not know how to manage its own\naffairs either morally or materially, and could not sweep out filth any\nbetter than it could abuses. Everything presented an obstacle,\neverything raised a question. The sewer, for example, was refractory to\nevery itinerary. One could no more find one’s bearings in the sewer\nthan one could understand one’s position in the city; above the\nunintelligible, below the inextricable; beneath the confusion of\ntongues there reigned the confusion of caverns; Dædalus backed up\nBabel.\n\nSometimes the Paris sewer took a notion to overflow, as though this\nmisunderstood Nile were suddenly seized with a fit of rage. There\noccurred, infamous to relate, inundations of the sewer. At times, that\nstomach of civilization digested badly, the cesspool flowed back into\nthe throat of the city, and Paris got an after-taste of her own filth.\nThese resemblances of the sewer to remorse had their good points; they\nwere warnings; very badly accepted, however; the city waxed indignant\nat the audacity of its mire, and did not admit that the filth should\nreturn. Drive it out better.\n\nThe inundation of 1802 is one of the actual memories of Parisians of\nthe age of eighty. The mud spread in cross-form over the Place des\nVictoires, where stands the statue of Louis XIV.; it entered the Rue\nSaint-Honoré by the two mouths to the sewer in the Champs-Élysées, the\nRue Saint-Florentin through the Saint-Florentin sewer, the Rue\nPierre-à-Poisson through the sewer de la Sonnerie, the Rue Popincourt,\nthrough the sewer of the Chemin-Vert, the Rue de la Roquette, through\nthe sewer of the Rue de Lappe; it covered the drain of the Rue des\nChamps-Élysées to the height of thirty-five centimetres; and, to the\nSouth, through the vent of the Seine, performing its functions in\ninverse sense, it penetrated the Rue Mazarine, the Rue de l‘Échaudé,\nand the Rue des Marais, where it stopped at a distance of one hundred\nand nine metres, a few paces distant from the house in which Racine had\nlived, respecting, in the seventeenth century, the poet more than the\nKing. It attained its maximum depth in the Rue Saint-Pierre, where it\nrose to the height of three feet above the flag-stones of the\nwater-spout, and its maximum length in the Rue Saint-Sabin, where it\nspread out over a stretch two hundred and thirty-eight metres in\nlength.\n\nAt the beginning of this century, the sewer of Paris was still a\nmysterious place. Mud can never enjoy a good fame; but in this case its\nevil renown reached the verge of the terrible. Paris knew, in a\nconfused way, that she had under her a terrible cavern. People talked\nof it as of that monstrous bed of Thebes in which swarmed centipedes\nfifteen long feet in length, and which might have served Behemoth for a\nbathtub. The great boots of the sewermen never ventured further than\ncertain well-known points. We were then very near the epoch when the\nscavenger’s carts, from the summit of which Sainte-Foix fraternized\nwith the Marquis de Créqui, discharged their loads directly into the\nsewer. As for cleaning out,—that function was entrusted to the pouring\nrains which encumbered rather than swept away. Rome left some poetry to\nher sewer, and called it the Gemoniæ; Paris insulted hers, and entitled\nit the Polypus-Hole. Science and superstition were in accord, in\nhorror. The Polypus hole was no less repugnant to hygiene than to\nlegend. The goblin was developed under the fetid covering of the\nMouffetard sewer; the corpses of the Marmousets had been cast into the\nsewer de la Barillerie; Fagon attributed the redoubtable malignant\nfever of 1685 to the great hiatus of the sewer of the Marais, which\nremained yawning until 1833 in the Rue Saint-Louis, almost opposite the\nsign of the _Gallant Messenger_. The mouth of the sewer of the Rue de\nla Mortellerie was celebrated for the pestilences which had their\nsource there; with its grating of iron, with points simulating a row of\nteeth, it was like a dragon’s maw in that fatal street, breathing forth\nhell upon men. The popular imagination seasoned the sombre Parisian\nsink with some indescribably hideous intermixture of the infinite. The\nsewer had no bottom. The sewer was the lower world. The idea of\nexploring these leprous regions did not even occur to the police. To\ntry that unknown thing, to cast the plummet into that shadow, to set\nout on a voyage of discovery in that abyss—who would have dared? It was\nalarming. Nevertheless, some one did present himself. The cesspool had\nits Christopher Columbus.\n\nOne day, in 1805, during one of the rare apparitions which the Emperor\nmade in Paris, the Minister of the Interior, some Decrès or Crétet or\nother, came to the master’s intimate levee. In the Carrousel there was\naudible the clanking of swords of all those extraordinary soldiers of\nthe great Republic, and of the great Empire; then Napoleon’s door was\nblocked with heroes; men from the Rhine, from the Escaut, from the\nAdige, and from the Nile; companions of Joubert, of Desaix, of Marceau,\nof Hoche, of Kléber; the aérostiers of Fleurus, the grenadiers of\nMayence, the pontoon-builders of Genoa, hussars whom the Pyramids had\nlooked down upon, artillerists whom Junot’s cannon-ball had spattered\nwith mud, cuirassiers who had taken by assault the fleet lying at\nanchor in the Zuyderzee; some had followed Bonaparte upon the bridge of\nLodi, others had accompanied Murat in the trenches of Mantua, others\nhad preceded Lannes in the hollow road of Montebello. The whole army of\nthat day was present there, in the court-yard of the Tuileries,\nrepresented by a squadron or a platoon, and guarding Napoleon in\nrepose; and that was the splendid epoch when the grand army had Marengo\nbehind it and Austerlitz before it.—“Sire,” said the Minister of the\nInterior to Napoleon, “yesterday I saw the most intrepid man in your\nEmpire.”—“What man is that?” said the Emperor brusquely, “and what has\nhe done?”—“He wants to do something, Sire.”—“What is it?”—“To visit the\nsewers of Paris.”\n\n\nThis man existed and his name was Bruneseau.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nThe visit took place. It was a formidable campaign; a nocturnal battle\nagainst pestilence and suffocation. It was, at the same time, a voyage\nof discovery. One of the survivors of this expedition, an intelligent\nworkingman, who was very young at the time, related curious details\nwith regard to it, several years ago, which Bruneseau thought himself\nobliged to omit in his report to the prefect of police, as unworthy of\nofficial style. The processes of disinfection were, at that epoch,\nextremely rudimentary. Hardly had Bruneseau crossed the first\narticulations of that subterranean network, when eight laborers out of\nthe twenty refused to go any further. The operation was complicated;\nthe visit entailed the necessity of cleaning; hence it was necessary to\ncleanse and at the same time, to proceed; to note the entrances of\nwater, to count the gratings and the vents, to lay out in detail the\nbranches, to indicate the currents at the point where they parted, to\ndefine the respective bounds of the divers basins, to sound the small\nsewers grafted on the principal sewer, to measure the height under the\nkey-stone of each drain, and the width, at the spring of the vaults as\nwell as at the bottom, in order to determine the arrangements with\nregard to the level of each water-entrance, either of the bottom of the\narch, or on the soil of the street. They advanced with toil. The\nlanterns pined away in the foul atmosphere. From time to time, a\nfainting sewerman was carried out. At certain points, there were\nprecipices. The soil had given away, the pavement had crumbled, the\nsewer had changed into a bottomless well; they found nothing solid; a\nman disappeared suddenly; they had great difficulty in getting him out\nagain. On the advice of Fourcroy, they lighted large cages filled with\ntow steeped in resin, from time to time, in spots which had been\nsufficiently disinfected. In some places, the wall was covered with\nmisshapen fungi,—one would have said tumors; the very stone seemed\ndiseased within this unbreathable atmosphere.\n\nBruneseau, in his exploration, proceeded down hill. At the point of\nseparation of the two water-conduits of the Grand-Hurleur, he\ndeciphered upon a projecting stone the date of 1550; this stone\nindicated the limits where Philibert Delorme, charged by Henri II. with\nvisiting the subterranean drains of Paris, had halted. This stone was\nthe mark of the sixteenth century on the sewer; Bruneseau found the\nhandiwork of the seventeenth century once more in the Ponceau drain of\nthe old Rue Vieille-du-Temple, vaulted between 1600 and 1650; and the\nhandiwork of the eighteenth in the western section of the collecting\ncanal, walled and vaulted in 1740. These two vaults, especially the\nless ancient, that of 1740, were more cracked and decrepit than the\nmasonry of the belt sewer, which dated from 1412, an epoch when the\nbrook of fresh water of Ménilmontant was elevated to the dignity of the\nGrand Sewer of Paris, an advancement analogous to that of a peasant who\nshould become first _valet de chambre_ to the King; something like\nGros-Jean transformed into Lebel.\n\nHere and there, particularly beneath the Court-House, they thought they\nrecognized the hollows of ancient dungeons, excavated in the very sewer\nitself. Hideous _in-pace_. An iron neck-collar was hanging in one of\nthese cells. They walled them all up. Some of their finds were\nsingular; among others, the skeleton of an ourang-outan, who had\ndisappeared from the Jardin des Plantes in 1800, a disappearance\nprobably connected with the famous and indisputable apparition of the\ndevil in the Rue des Bernardins, in the last year of the eighteenth\ncentury. The poor devil had ended by drowning himself in the sewer.\n\nBeneath this long, arched drain which terminated at the Arche-Marion, a\nperfectly preserved rag-picker’s basket excited the admiration of all\nconnoisseurs. Everywhere, the mire, which the sewermen came to handle\nwith intrepidity, abounded in precious objects, jewels of gold and\nsilver, precious stones, coins. If a giant had filtered this cesspool,\nhe would have had the riches of centuries in his lair. At the point\nwhere the two branches of the Rue du Temple and of the Rue Sainte-Avoye\nseparate, they picked up a singular Huguenot medal in copper, bearing\non one side the pig hooded with a cardinal’s hat, and on the other, a\nwolf with a tiara on his head.\n\nThe most surprising rencounter was at the entrance to the Grand Sewer.\nThis entrance had formerly been closed by a grating of which nothing\nbut the hinges remained. From one of these hinges hung a dirty and\nshapeless rag which, arrested there in its passage, no doubt, had\nfloated there in the darkness and finished its process of being torn\napart. Bruneseau held his lantern close to this rag and examined it. It\nwas of very fine batiste, and in one of the corners, less frayed than\nthe rest, they made out a heraldic coronet and embroidered above these\nseven letters: LAVBESP. The crown was the coronet of a Marquis, and the\nseven letters signified _Laubespine_. They recognized the fact, that\nwhat they had before their eyes was a morsel of the shroud of Marat.\nMarat in his youth had had amorous intrigues. This was when he was a\nmember of the household of the Comte d’Artois, in the capacity of\nphysician to the Stables. From these love affairs, historically proved,\nwith a great lady, he had retained this sheet. As a waif or a souvenir.\nAt his death, as this was the only linen of any fineness which he had\nin his house, they buried him in it. Some old women had shrouded him\nfor the tomb in that swaddling-band in which the tragic Friend of the\npeople had enjoyed voluptuousness. Bruneseau passed on. They left that\nrag where it hung; they did not put the finishing touch to it. Did this\narise from scorn or from respect? Marat deserved both. And then,\ndestiny was there sufficiently stamped to make them hesitate to touch\nit. Besides, the things of the sepulchre must be left in the spot which\nthey select. In short, the relic was a strange one. A Marquise had\nslept in it; Marat had rotted in it; it had traversed the Pantheon to\nend with the rats of the sewer. This chamber rag, of which Watteau\nwould formerly have joyfully sketched every fold, had ended in becoming\nworthy of the fixed gaze of Dante.\n\nThe whole visit to the subterranean stream of filth of Paris lasted\nseven years, from 1805 to 1812. As he proceeded, Bruneseau drew,\ndirected, and completed considerable works; in 1808 he lowered the arch\nof the Ponceau, and, everywhere creating new lines, he pushed the\nsewer, in 1809, under the Rue Saint-Denis as far as the fountain of the\nInnocents; in 1810, under the Rue Froidmanteau and under the\nSalpêtrière; in 1811 under the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Pères, under the\nRue du Mail, under the Rue de l‘Écharpe, under the Place Royale; in\n1812, under the Rue de la Paix, and under the Chaussée d’Antin. At the\nsame time, he had the whole network disinfected and rendered healthful.\nIn the second year of his work, Bruneseau engaged the assistance of his\nson-in-law Nargaud.\n\nIt was thus that, at the beginning of the century, ancient society\ncleansed its double bottom, and performed the toilet of its sewer.\nThere was that much clean, at all events.\n\nTortuous, cracked, unpaved, full of fissures, intersected by gullies,\njolted by eccentric elbows, mounting and descending illogically, fetid,\nwild, fierce, submerged in obscurity, with cicatrices on its pavements\nand scars on its walls, terrible,—such was, retrospectively viewed, the\nantique sewer of Paris. Ramifications in every direction, crossings, of\ntrenches, branches, goose-feet, stars, as in military mines, cœcum,\nblind alleys, vaults lined with saltpetre, pestiferous pools, scabby\nsweats, on the walls, drops dripping from the ceilings, darkness;\nnothing could equal the horror of this old, waste crypt, the digestive\napparatus of Babylon, a cavern, ditch, gulf pierced with streets, a\ntitanic mole-burrow, where the mind seems to behold that enormous blind\nmole, the past, prowling through the shadows, in the filth which has\nbeen splendor.\n\nThis, we repeat, was the sewer of the past.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—PRESENT PROGRESS\n\n\nTo-day the sewer is clean, cold, straight, correct. It almost realizes\nthe ideal of what is understood in England by the word “respectable.”\nIt is proper and grayish; laid out by rule and line; one might almost\nsay as though it came out of a bandbox. It resembles a tradesman who\nhas become a councillor of state. One can almost see distinctly there.\nThe mire there comports itself with decency. At first, one might\nreadily mistake it for one of those subterranean corridors, which were\nso common in former days, and so useful in flights of monarchs and\nprinces, in those good old times, “when the people loved their kings.”\nThe present sewer is a beautiful sewer; the pure style reigns there;\nthe classical rectilinear alexandrine which, driven out of poetry,\nappears to have taken refuge in architecture, seems mingled with all\nthe stones of that long, dark and whitish vault; each outlet is an\narcade; the Rue de Rivoli serves as pattern even in the sewer. However,\nif the geometrical line is in place anywhere, it is certainly in the\ndrainage trench of a great city. There, everything should be\nsubordinated to the shortest road. The sewer has, nowadays, assumed a\ncertain official aspect. The very police reports, of which it sometimes\nforms the subject, no longer are wanting in respect towards it. The\nwords which characterize it in administrative language are sonorous and\ndignified. What used to be called a gut is now called a gallery; what\nused to be called a hole is now called a surveying orifice. Villon\nwould no longer meet with his ancient temporary provisional lodging.\nThis network of cellars has its immemorial population of prowlers,\nrodents, swarming in greater numbers than ever; from time to time, an\naged and veteran rat risks his head at the window of the sewer and\nsurveys the Parisians; but even these vermin grow tame, so satisfied\nare they with their subterranean palace. The cesspool no longer retains\nanything of its primitive ferocity. The rain, which in former days\nsoiled the sewer, now washes it. Nevertheless, do not trust yourself\ntoo much to it. Miasmas still inhabit it. It is more hypocritical than\nirreproachable. The prefecture of police and the commission of health\nhave done their best. But, in spite of all the processes of\ndisinfection, it exhales, a vague, suspicious odor like Tartuffe after\nconfession.\n\nLet us confess, that, taking it all in all, this sweeping is a homage\nwhich the sewer pays to civilization, and as, from this point of view,\nTartuffe’s conscience is a progress over the Augean stables, it is\ncertain that the sewers of Paris have been improved.\n\nIt is more than progress; it is transmutation. Between the ancient and\nthe present sewer there is a revolution. What has effected this\nrevolution?\n\nThe man whom all the world forgets, and whom we have mentioned,\nBruneseau.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—FUTURE PROGRESS\n\n\nThe excavation of the sewer of Paris has been no slight task. The last\nten centuries have toiled at it without being able to bring it to a\ntermination, any more than they have been able to finish Paris. The\nsewer, in fact, receives all the counter-shocks of the growth of Paris.\nWithin the bosom of the earth, it is a sort of mysterious polyp with a\nthousand antennæ, which expands below as the city expands above. Every\ntime that the city cuts a street, the sewer stretches out an arm. The\nold monarchy had constructed only twenty-three thousand three hundred\nmetres of sewers; that was where Paris stood in this respect on the\nfirst of January, 1806. Beginning with this epoch, of which we shall\nshortly speak, the work was usefully and energetically resumed and\nprosecuted; Napoleon built—the figures are curious—four thousand eight\nhundred and four metres; Louis XVIII., five thousand seven hundred and\nnine; Charles X., ten thousand eight hundred and thirty-six;\nLouis-Philippe, eighty-nine thousand and twenty; the Republic of 1848,\ntwenty-three thousand three hundred and eighty-one; the present\ngovernment, seventy thousand five hundred; in all, at the present time,\ntwo hundred and twenty-six thousand six hundred and ten metres; sixty\nleagues of sewers; the enormous entrails of Paris. An obscure\nramification ever at work; a construction which is immense and ignored.\n\nAs the reader sees, the subterranean labyrinth of Paris is to-day more\nthan ten times what it was at the beginning of the century. It is\ndifficult to form any idea of all the perseverance and the efforts\nwhich have been required to bring this cesspool to the point of\nrelative perfection in which it now is. It was with great difficulty\nthat the ancient monarchical provostship and, during the last ten years\nof the eighteenth century, the revolutionary mayoralty, had succeeded\nin perforating the five leagues of sewer which existed previous to\n1806. All sorts of obstacles hindered this operation, some peculiar to\nthe soil, others inherent in the very prejudices of the laborious\npopulation of Paris. Paris is built upon a soil which is singularly\nrebellious to the pick, the hoe, the bore, and to human manipulation.\nThere is nothing more difficult to pierce and to penetrate than the\ngeological formation upon which is superposed the marvellous historical\nformation called Paris; as soon as work in any form whatsoever is begun\nand adventures upon this stretch of alluvium, subterranean resistances\nabound. There are liquid clays, springs, hard rocks, and those soft and\ndeep quagmires which special science calls _moutardes_.59 The pick\nadvances laboriously through the calcareous layers alternating with\nvery slender threads of clay, and schistose beds in plates incrusted\nwith oyster-shells, the contemporaries of the pre-Adamite oceans.\nSometimes a rivulet suddenly bursts through a vault that has been\nbegun, and inundates the laborers; or a layer of marl is laid bare, and\nrolls down with the fury of a cataract, breaking the stoutest\nsupporting beams like glass. Quite recently, at Villette, when it\nbecame necessary to pass the collecting sewer under the Saint-Martin\ncanal without interrupting navigation or emptying the canal, a fissure\nappeared in the basin of the canal, water suddenly became abundant in\nthe subterranean tunnel, which was beyond the power of the pumping\nengines; it was necessary to send a diver to explore the fissure which\nhad been made in the narrow entrance of the grand basin, and it was not\nwithout great difficulty that it was stopped up. Elsewhere near the\nSeine, and even at a considerable distance from the river, as for\ninstance, at Belleville, Grand-Rue and Lumière Passage, quicksands are\nencountered in which one sticks fast, and in which a man sinks visibly.\nAdd suffocation by miasmas, burial by slides, and sudden crumbling of\nthe earth. Add the typhus, with which the workmen become slowly\nimpregnated. In our own day, after having excavated the gallery of\nClichy, with a banquette to receive the principal water-conduit of\nOurcq, a piece of work which was executed in a trench ten metres deep;\nafter having, in the midst of land-slides, and with the aid of\nexcavations often putrid, and of shoring up, vaulted the Bièvre from\nthe Boulevard de l’Hôpital, as far as the Seine; after having, in order\nto deliver Paris from the floods of Montmartre and in order to provide\nan outlet for that river-like pool nine hectares in extent, which\ncrouched near the Barrière des Martyrs, after having, let us state,\nconstructed the line of sewers from the Barrière Blanche to the road of\nAubervilliers, in four months, working day and night, at a depth of\neleven metres; after having—a thing heretofore unseen—made a\nsubterranean sewer in the Rue Barre-du-Bec, without a trench, six\nmetres below the surface, the superintendent, Monnot, died. After\nhaving vaulted three thousand metres of sewer in all quarters of the\ncity, from the Rue Traversière-Saint-Antoine to the Rue de l’Ourcine,\nafter having freed the Carrefour Censier-Mouffetard from inundations of\nrain by means of the branch of the Arbalète, after having built the\nSaint-Georges sewer, on rock and concrete in the fluid sands, after\nhaving directed the formidable lowering of the flooring of the vault\ntimber in the Notre-Dame-de-Nazareth branch, Duleau the engineer died.\nThere are no bulletins for such acts of bravery as these, which are\nmore useful, nevertheless, than the brutal slaughter of the field of\nbattle.\n\nThe sewers of Paris in 1832 were far from being what they are to-day.\nBruneseau had given the impulse, but the cholera was required to bring\nabout the vast reconstruction which took place later on. It is\nsurprising to say, for example, that in 1821, a part of the belt sewer,\ncalled the Grand Canal, as in Venice, still stood stagnating uncovered\nto the sky, in the Rue des Gourdes. It was only in 1821 that the city\nof Paris found in its pocket the two hundred and sixty-thousand eighty\nfrancs and six centimes required for covering this mass of filth. The\nthree absorbing wells, of the Combat, the Cunette, and Saint-Mandé,\nwith their discharging mouths, their apparatus, their cesspools, and\ntheir depuratory branches, only date from 1836. The intestinal sewer of\nParis has been made over anew, and, as we have said, it has been\nextended more than tenfold within the last quarter of a century.\n\nThirty years ago, at the epoch of the insurrection of the 5th and 6th\nof June, it was still, in many localities, nearly the same ancient\nsewer. A very great number of streets which are now convex were then\nsunken causeways. At the end of a slope, where the tributaries of a\nstreet or crossroads ended, there were often to be seen large, square\ngratings with heavy bars, whose iron, polished by the footsteps of the\nthrong, gleamed dangerous and slippery for vehicles, and caused horses\nto fall. The official language of the Roads and Bridges gave to these\ngratings the expressive name of _Cassis_.60\n\nIn 1832, in a number of streets, in the Rue de l‘Étoile, the Rue\nSaint-Louis, the Rue du Temple, the Rue Vieille-du-Temple, the Rue\nNotre-Dame de Nazareth, the Rue Folie-Méricourt, the Quai aux Fleurs,\nthe Rue du Petit-Musc, the Rue du Normandie, the Rue Pont-Aux-Biches,\nthe Rue des Marais, the Faubourg Saint-Martin, the Rue Notre Dame\ndes-Victoires, the Faubourg Montmartre, the Rue Grange-Batelière, in\nthe Champs-Élysées, the Rue Jacob, the Rue de Tournon, the ancient\ngothic sewer still cynically displayed its maw. It consisted of\nenormous voids of stone catch-basins sometimes surrounded by stone\nposts, with monumental effrontery.\n\nParis in 1806 still had nearly the same sewers numerically as stated in\n1663; five thousand three hundred fathoms. After Bruneseau, on the 1st\nof January, 1832, it had forty thousand three hundred metres. Between\n1806 and 1831, there had been built, on an average, seven hundred and\nfifty metres annually, afterwards eight and even ten thousand metres of\ngalleries were constructed every year, in masonry, of small stones,\nwith hydraulic mortar which hardens under water, on a cement\nfoundation. At two hundred francs the metre, the sixty leagues of\nParis’ sewers of the present day represent forty-eight millions.\n\nIn addition to the economic progress which we have indicated at the\nbeginning, grave problems of public hygiene are connected with that\nimmense question: the sewers of Paris.\n\nParis is the centre of two sheets, a sheet of water and a sheet of air.\nThe sheet of water, lying at a tolerably great depth underground, but\nalready sounded by two bores, is furnished by the layer of green clay\nsituated between the chalk and the Jurassic lime-stone; this layer may\nbe represented by a disk five and twenty leagues in circumference; a\nmultitude of rivers and brooks ooze there; one drinks the Seine, the\nMarne, the Yonne, the Oise, the Aisne, the Cher, the Vienne and the\nLoire in a glass of water from the well of Grenelle. The sheet of water\nis healthy, it comes from heaven in the first place and next from the\nearth; the sheet of air is unhealthy, it comes from the sewer. All the\nmiasms of the cesspool are mingled with the breath of the city; hence\nthis bad breath. The air taken from above a dung-heap, as has been\nscientifically proved, is purer than the air taken from above Paris. In\na given time, with the aid of progress, mechanisms become perfected,\nand as light increases, the sheet of water will be employed to purify\nthe sheet of air; that is to say, to wash the sewer. The reader knows,\nthat by “washing the sewer” we mean: the restitution of the filth to\nthe earth; the return to the soil of dung and of manure to the fields.\nThrough this simple act, the entire social community will experience a\ndiminution of misery and an augmentation of health. At the present\nhour, the radiation of diseases from Paris extends to fifty leagues\naround the Louvre, taken as the hub of this pestilential wheel.\n\nWe might say that, for ten centuries, the cesspool has been the disease\nof Paris. The sewer is the blemish which Paris has in her blood. The\npopular instinct has never been deceived in it. The occupation of\nsewermen was formerly almost as perilous, and almost as repugnant to\nthe people, as the occupation of knacker, which was so long held in\nhorror and handed over to the executioner. High wages were necessary to\ninduce a mason to disappear in that fetid mine; the ladder of the\ncesspool cleaner hesitated to plunge into it; it was said, in\nproverbial form: “to descend into the sewer is to enter the grave;” and\nall sorts of hideous legends, as we have said, covered this colossal\nsink with terror; a dread sink-hole which bears the traces of the\nrevolutions of the globe as of the revolutions of man, and where are to\nbe found vestiges of all cataclysms from the shells of the Deluge to\nthe rag of Marat.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THIRD—MUD BUT THE SOUL\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE SEWER AND ITS SURPRISES\n\n\nIt was in the sewers of Paris that Jean Valjean found himself.\n\nStill another resemblance between Paris and the sea. As in the ocean,\nthe diver may disappear there.\n\nThe transition was an unheard-of one. In the very heart of the city,\nJean Valjean had escaped from the city, and, in the twinkling of an\neye, in the time required to lift the cover and to replace it, he had\npassed from broad daylight to complete obscurity, from midday to\nmidnight, from tumult to silence, from the whirlwind of thunders to the\nstagnation of the tomb, and, by a vicissitude far more tremendous even\nthan that of the Rue Polonceau, from the most extreme peril to the most\nabsolute obscurity.\n\nAn abrupt fall into a cavern; a disappearance into the secret trap-door\nof Paris; to quit that street where death was on every side, for that\nsort of sepulchre where there was life, was a strange instant. He\nremained for several seconds as though bewildered; listening,\nstupefied. The waste-trap of safety had suddenly yawned beneath him.\nCelestial goodness had, in a manner, captured him by treachery.\nAdorable ambuscades of providence!\n\nOnly, the wounded man did not stir, and Jean Valjean did not know\nwhether that which he was carrying in that grave was a living being or\na dead corpse.\n\nHis first sensation was one of blindness. All of a sudden, he could see\nnothing. It seemed to him too, that, in one instant, he had become\ndeaf. He no longer heard anything. The frantic storm of murder which\nhad been let loose a few feet above his head did not reach him, thanks\nto the thickness of the earth which separated him from it, as we have\nsaid, otherwise than faintly and indistinctly, and like a rumbling, in\nthe depths. He felt that the ground was solid under his feet; that was\nall; but that was enough. He extended one arm and then the other,\ntouched the walls on both sides, and perceived that the passage was\nnarrow; he slipped, and thus perceived that the pavement was wet. He\ncautiously put forward one foot, fearing a hole, a sink, some gulf; he\ndiscovered that the paving continued. A gust of fetidness informed him\nof the place in which he stood.\n\nAfter the lapse of a few minutes, he was no longer blind. A little\nlight fell through the man-hole through which he had descended, and his\neyes became accustomed to this cavern. He began to distinguish\nsomething. The passage in which he had burrowed—no other word can\nbetter express the situation—was walled in behind him. It was one of\nthose blind alleys, which the special jargon terms branches. In front\nof him there was another wall, a wall like night. The light of the\nair-hole died out ten or twelve paces from the point where Jean Valjean\nstood, and barely cast a wan pallor on a few metres of the damp walls\nof the sewer. Beyond, the opaqueness was massive; to penetrate thither\nseemed horrible, an entrance into it appeared like an engulfment. A man\ncould, however, plunge into that wall of fog and it was necessary so to\ndo. Haste was even requisite. It occurred to Jean Valjean that the\ngrating which he had caught sight of under the flag-stones might also\ncatch the eye of the soldiery, and that everything hung upon this\nchance. They also might descend into that well and search it. There was\nnot a minute to be lost. He had deposited Marius on the ground, he\npicked him up again,—that is the real word for it,—placed him on his\nshoulders once more, and set out. He plunged resolutely into the gloom.\n\nThe truth is, that they were less safe than Jean Valjean fancied.\nPerils of another sort and no less serious were awaiting them,\nperchance. After the lightning-charged whirlwind of the combat, the\ncavern of miasmas and traps; after chaos, the sewer. Jean Valjean had\nfallen from one circle of hell into another.\n\nWhen he had advanced fifty paces, he was obliged to halt. A problem\npresented itself. The passage terminated in another gut which he\nencountered across his path. There two ways presented themselves. Which\nshould he take? Ought he to turn to the left or to the right? How was\nhe to find his bearings in that black labyrinth? This labyrinth, to\nwhich we have already called the reader’s attention, has a clue, which\nis its slope. To follow to the slope is to arrive at the river.\n\nThis Jean Valjean instantly comprehended.\n\nHe said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des Halles; that\nif he were to choose the path to the left and follow the slope, he\nwould arrive, in less than a quarter of an hour, at some mouth on the\nSeine between the Pont au Change and the Pont-Neuf, that is to say, he\nwould make his appearance in broad daylight on the most densely peopled\nspot in Paris. Perhaps he would come out on some man-hole at the\nintersection of streets. Amazement of the passers-by at beholding two\nbleeding men emerge from the earth at their feet. Arrival of the\npolice, a call to arms of the neighboring post of guards. Thus they\nwould be seized before they had even got out. It would be better to\nplunge into that labyrinth, to confide themselves to that black gloom,\nand to trust to Providence for the outcome.\n\nHe ascended the incline, and turned to the right.\n\nWhen he had turned the angle of the gallery, the distant glimmer of an\nair-hole disappeared, the curtain of obscurity fell upon him once more,\nand he became blind again. Nevertheless, he advanced as rapidly as\npossible. Marius’ two arms were passed round his neck, and the former’s\nfeet dragged behind him. He held both these arms with one hand, and\ngroped along the wall with the other. Marius’ cheek touched his, and\nclung there, bleeding. He felt a warm stream which came from Marius\ntrickling down upon him and making its way under his clothes. But a\nhumid warmth near his ear, which the mouth of the wounded man touched,\nindicated respiration, and consequently, life. The passage along which\nJean Valjean was now proceeding was not so narrow as the first. Jean\nValjean walked through it with considerable difficulty. The rain of the\npreceding day had not, as yet, entirely run off, and it created a\nlittle torrent in the centre of the bottom, and he was forced to hug\nthe wall in order not to have his feet in the water.\n\nThus he proceeded in the gloom. He resembled the beings of the night\ngroping in the invisible and lost beneath the earth in veins of shadow.\n\nStill, little by little, whether it was that the distant air-holes\nemitted a little wavering light in this opaque gloom, or whether his\neyes had become accustomed to the obscurity, some vague vision returned\nto him, and he began once more to gain a confused idea, now of the wall\nwhich he touched, now of the vault beneath which he was passing. The\npupil dilates in the dark, and the soul dilates in misfortune and ends\nby finding God there.\n\nIt was not easy to direct his course.\n\nThe line of the sewer re-echoes, so to speak, the line of the streets\nwhich lie above it. There were then in Paris two thousand two hundred\nstreets. Let the reader imagine himself beneath that forest of gloomy\nbranches which is called the sewer. The system of sewers existing at\nthat epoch, placed end to end, would have given a length of eleven\nleagues. We have said above, that the actual network, thanks to the\nspecial activity of the last thirty years, was no less than sixty\nleagues in extent.\n\nJean Valjean began by committing a blunder. He thought that he was\nbeneath the Rue Saint-Denis, and it was a pity that it was not so.\nUnder the Rue Saint-Denis there is an old stone sewer which dates from\nLouis XIII. and which runs straight to the collecting sewer, called the\nGrand Sewer, with but a single elbow, on the right, on the elevation of\nthe ancient Cour des Miracles, and a single branch, the Saint-Martin\nsewer, whose four arms describe a cross. But the gut of the\nPetite-Truanderie the entrance to which was in the vicinity of the\nCorinthe wine-shop has never communicated with the sewer of the Rue\nSaint-Denis; it ended at the Montmartre sewer, and it was in this that\nJean Valjean was entangled. There opportunities of losing oneself\nabound. The Montmartre sewer is one of the most labyrinthine of the\nancient network. Fortunately, Jean Valjean had left behind him the\nsewer of the markets whose geometrical plan presents the appearance of\na multitude of parrots’ roosts piled on top of each other; but he had\nbefore him more than one embarrassing encounter and more than one\nstreet corner—for they are streets—presenting itself in the gloom like\nan interrogation point; first, on his left, the vast sewer of the\nPlâtrière, a sort of Chinese puzzle, thrusting out and entangling its\nchaos of Ts and Zs under the Post-Office and under the rotunda of the\nWheat Market, as far as the Seine, where it terminates in a Y;\nsecondly, on his right, the curving corridor of the Rue du Cadran with\nits three teeth, which are also blind courts; thirdly, on his left, the\nbranch of the Mail, complicated, almost at its inception, with a sort\nof fork, and proceeding from zig-zag to zig-zag until it ends in the\ngrand crypt of the outlet of the Louvre, truncated and ramified in\nevery direction; and lastly, the blind alley of a passage of the Rue\ndes Jeûneurs, without counting little ducts here and there, before\nreaching the belt sewer, which alone could conduct him to some issue\nsufficiently distant to be safe.\n\nHad Jean Valjean had any idea of all that we have here pointed out, he\nwould speedily have perceived, merely by feeling the wall, that he was\nnot in the subterranean gallery of the Rue Saint-Denis. Instead of the\nancient stone, instead of the antique architecture, haughty and royal\neven in the sewer, with pavement and string courses of granite and\nmortar costing eight hundred livres the fathom, he would have felt\nunder his hand contemporary cheapness, economical expedients, porous\nstone filled with mortar on a concrete foundation, which costs two\nhundred francs the metre, and the bourgeoise masonry known as _à petits\nmatériaux_—small stuff; but of all this he knew nothing.\n\nHe advanced with anxiety, but with calmness, seeing nothing, knowing\nnothing, buried in chance, that is to say, engulfed in providence.\n\nBy degrees, we will admit, a certain horror seized upon him. The gloom\nwhich enveloped him penetrated his spirit. He walked in an enigma. This\naqueduct of the sewer is formidable; it interlaces in a dizzy fashion.\nIt is a melancholy thing to be caught in this Paris of shadows. Jean\nValjean was obliged to find and even to invent his route without seeing\nit. In this unknown, every step that he risked might be his last. How\nwas he to get out? should he find an issue? should he find it in time?\nwould that colossal subterranean sponge with its stone cavities, allow\nitself to be penetrated and pierced? should he there encounter some\nunexpected knot in the darkness? should he arrive at the inextricable\nand the impassable? would Marius die there of hemorrhage and he of\nhunger? should they end by both getting lost, and by furnishing two\nskeletons in a nook of that night? He did not know. He put all these\nquestions to himself without replying to them. The intestines of Paris\nform a precipice. Like the prophet, he was in the belly of the monster.\n\nAll at once, he had a surprise. At the most unforeseen moment, and\nwithout having ceased to walk in a straight line, he perceived that he\nwas no longer ascending; the water of the rivulet was beating against\nhis heels, instead of meeting him at his toes. The sewer was now\ndescending. Why? Was he about to arrive suddenly at the Seine? This\ndanger was a great one, but the peril of retreating was still greater.\nHe continued to advance.\n\nIt was not towards the Seine that he was proceeding. The ridge which\nthe soil of Paris forms on its right bank empties one of its watersheds\ninto the Seine and the other into the Grand Sewer. The crest of this\nridge which determines the division of the waters describes a very\ncapricious line. The culminating point, which is the point of\nseparation of the currents, is in the Sainte-Avoye sewer, beyond the\nRue Michel-le-Comte, in the sewer of the Louvre, near the boulevards,\nand in the Montmartre sewer, near the Halles. It was this culminating\npoint that Jean Valjean had reached. He was directing his course\ntowards the belt sewer; he was on the right path. But he did not know\nit.\n\nEvery time that he encountered a branch, he felt of its angles, and if\nhe found that the opening which presented itself was smaller than the\npassage in which he was, he did not enter but continued his route,\nrightly judging that every narrower way must needs terminate in a blind\nalley, and could only lead him further from his goal, that is to say,\nthe outlet. Thus he avoided the quadruple trap which was set for him in\nthe darkness by the four labyrinths which we have just enumerated.\n\nAt a certain moment, he perceived that he was emerging from beneath the\nParis which was petrified by the uprising, where the barricades had\nsuppressed circulation, and that he was entering beneath the living and\nnormal Paris. Overhead he suddenly heard a noise as of thunder, distant\nbut continuous. It was the rumbling of vehicles.\n\nHe had been walking for about half an hour, at least according to the\ncalculation which he made in his own mind, and he had not yet thought\nof rest; he had merely changed the hand with which he was holding\nMarius. The darkness was more profound than ever, but its very depth\nreassured him.\n\nAll at once, he saw his shadow in front of him. It was outlined on a\nfaint, almost indistinct reddish glow, which vaguely empurpled the\nflooring vault underfoot, and the vault overhead, and gilded to his\nright and to his left the two viscous walls of the passage. Stupefied,\nhe turned round.\n\nBehind him, in the portion of the passage which he had just passed\nthrough, at a distance which appeared to him immense, piercing the\ndense obscurity, flamed a sort of horrible star which had the air of\nsurveying him.\n\nIt was the gloomy star of the police which was rising in the sewer.\n\nIn the rear of that star eight or ten forms were moving about in a\nconfused way, black, upright, indistinct, horrible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—EXPLANATION\n\n\nOn the day of the sixth of June, a battue of the sewers had been\nordered. It was feared that the vanquished might have taken to them for\nrefuge, and Prefect Gisquet was to search occult Paris while General\nBugeaud swept public Paris; a double and connected operation which\nexacted a double strategy on the part of the public force, represented\nabove by the army and below by the police. Three squads of agents and\nsewermen explored the subterranean drain of Paris, the first on the\nright bank, the second on the left bank, the third in the city. The\nagents of police were armed with carabines, with bludgeons, swords and\npoignards.\n\nThat which was directed at Jean Valjean at that moment, was the lantern\nof the patrol of the right bank.\n\nThis patrol had just visited the curving gallery and the three blind\nalleys which lie beneath the Rue du Cadran. While they were passing\ntheir lantern through the depths of these blind alleys, Jean Valjean\nhad encountered on his path the entrance to the gallery, had perceived\nthat it was narrower than the principal passage and had not penetrated\nthither. He had passed on. The police, on emerging from the gallery du\nCadran, had fancied that they heard the sound of footsteps in the\ndirection of the belt sewer. They were, in fact, the steps of Jean\nValjean. The sergeant in command of the patrol had raised his lantern,\nand the squad had begun to gaze into the mist in the direction whence\nthe sound proceeded.\n\nThis was an indescribable moment for Jean Valjean.\n\nHappily, if he saw the lantern well, the lantern saw him but ill. It\nwas light and he was shadow. He was very far off, and mingled with the\ndarkness of the place. He hugged the wall and halted. Moreover, he did\nnot understand what it was that was moving behind him. The lack of\nsleep and food, and his emotions had caused him also to pass into the\nstate of a visionary. He beheld a gleam, and around that gleam, forms.\nWhat was it? He did not comprehend.\n\nJean Valjean having paused, the sound ceased.\n\nThe men of the patrol listened, and heard nothing, they looked and saw\nnothing. They held a consultation.\n\nThere existed at that epoch at this point of the Montmartre sewer a\nsort of crossroads called _de service_, which was afterwards\nsuppressed, on account of the little interior lake which formed there,\nswallowing up the torrent of rain in heavy storms. The patrol could\nform a cluster in this open space. Jean Valjean saw these spectres form\na sort of circle. These bull-dogs’ heads approached each other closely\nand whispered together.\n\nThe result of this council held by the watch dogs was, that they had\nbeen mistaken, that there had been no noise, that it was useless to get\nentangled in the belt sewer, that it would only be a waste of time, but\nthat they ought to hasten towards Saint-Merry; that if there was\nanything to do, and any “bousingot” to track out, it was in that\nquarter.\n\nFrom time to time, parties re-sole their old insults. In 1832, the word\nbousingot formed the interim between the word jacobin, which had become\nobsolete, and the word demagogue which has since rendered such\nexcellent service.\n\nThe sergeant gave orders to turn to the left, towards the watershed of\nthe Seine.\n\nIf it had occurred to them to separate into two squads, and to go in\nboth directions, Jean Valjean would have been captured. All hung on\nthat thread. It is probable that the instructions of the prefecture,\nforeseeing a possibility of combat and insurgents in force, had\nforbidden the patrol to part company. The patrol resumed its march,\nleaving Jean Valjean behind it. Of all this movement, Jean Valjean\nperceived nothing, except the eclipse of the lantern which suddenly\nwheeled round.\n\nBefore taking his departure, the sergeant, in order to acquit his\npoliceman’s conscience, discharged his gun in the direction of Jean\nValjean. The detonation rolled from echo to echo in the crypt, like the\nrumbling of that titanic entrail. A bit of plaster which fell into the\nstream and splashed up the water a few paces away from Jean Valjean,\nwarned him that the ball had struck the arch over his head.\n\nSlow and measured steps resounded for some time on the timber work,\ngradually dying away as they retreated to a greater distance; the group\nof black forms vanished, a glimmer of light oscillated and floated,\ncommunicating to the vault a reddish glow which grew fainter, then\ndisappeared; the silence became profound once more, the obscurity\nbecame complete, blindness and deafness resumed possession of the\nshadows; and Jean Valjean, not daring to stir as yet, remained for a\nlong time leaning with his back against the wall, with straining ears,\nand dilated pupils, watching the disappearance of that phantom patrol.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—THE “SPUN” MAN\n\n\nThis justice must be rendered to the police of that period, that even\nin the most serious public junctures, it imperturbably fulfilled its\nduties connected with the sewers and surveillance. A revolt was, in its\neyes, no pretext for allowing malefactors to take the bit in their own\nmouths, and for neglecting society for the reason that the government\nwas in peril. The ordinary service was performed correctly in company\nwith the extraordinary service, and was not troubled by the latter. In\nthe midst of an incalculable political event already begun, under the\npressure of a possible revolution, a police agent, “spun” a thief\nwithout allowing himself to be distracted by insurrection and\nbarricades.\n\nIt was something precisely parallel which took place on the afternoon\nof the 6th of June on the banks of the Seine, on the slope of the right\nshore, a little beyond the Pont des Invalides.\n\nThere is no longer any bank there now. The aspect of the locality has\nchanged.\n\nOn that bank, two men, separated by a certain distance, seemed to be\nwatching each other while mutually avoiding each other. The one who was\nin advance was trying to get away, the one in the rear was trying to\novertake the other.\n\nIt was like a game of checkers played at a distance and in silence.\nNeither seemed to be in any hurry, and both walked slowly, as though\neach of them feared by too much haste to make his partner redouble his\npace.\n\nOne would have said that it was an appetite following its prey, and\npurposely without wearing the air of doing so. The prey was crafty and\non its guard.\n\nThe proper relations between the hunted pole-cat and the hunting dog\nwere observed. The one who was seeking to escape had an insignificant\nmien and not an impressive appearance; the one who was seeking to seize\nhim was rude of aspect, and must have been rude to encounter.\n\nThe first, conscious that he was the more feeble, avoided the second;\nbut he avoided him in a manner which was deeply furious; any one who\ncould have observed him would have discerned in his eyes the sombre\nhostility of flight, and all the menace that fear contains.\n\nThe shore was deserted; there were no passers-by; not even a boatman\nnor a lighter-man was in the skiffs which were moored here and there.\n\nIt was not easy to see these two men, except from the quay opposite,\nand to any person who had scrutinized them at that distance, the man\nwho was in advance would have appeared like a bristling, tattered, and\nequivocal being, who was uneasy and trembling beneath a ragged blouse,\nand the other like a classic and official personage, wearing the\nfrock-coat of authority buttoned to the chin.\n\nPerchance the reader might recognize these two men, if he were to see\nthem closer at hand.\n\nWhat was the object of the second man?\n\nProbably to succeed in clothing the first more warmly.\n\nWhen a man clothed by the state pursues a man in rags, it is in order\nto make of him a man who is also clothed by the state. Only, the whole\nquestion lies in the color. To be dressed in blue is glorious; to be\ndressed in red is disagreeable.\n\nThere is a purple from below.\n\nIt is probably some unpleasantness and some purple of this sort which\nthe first man is desirous of shirking.\n\nIf the other allowed him to walk on, and had not seized him as yet, it\nwas, judging from all appearances, in the hope of seeing him lead up to\nsome significant meeting-place and to some group worth catching. This\ndelicate operation is called “spinning.”\n\n\nWhat renders this conjecture entirely probable is that the buttoned-up\nman, on catching sight from the shore of a hackney-coach on the quay as\nit was passing along empty, made a sign to the driver; the driver\nunderstood, evidently recognized the person with whom he had to deal,\nturned about and began to follow the two men at the top of the quay, at\na foot-pace. This was not observed by the slouching and tattered\npersonage who was in advance.\n\nThe hackney-coach rolled along the trees of the Champs-Élysées. The\nbust of the driver, whip in hand, could be seen moving along above the\nparapet.\n\nOne of the secret instructions of the police authorities to their\nagents contains this article: “Always have on hand a hackney-coach, in\ncase of emergency.”\n\n\nWhile these two men were manœuvring, each on his own side, with\nirreproachable strategy, they approached an inclined plane on the quay\nwhich descended to the shore, and which permitted cab-drivers arriving\nfrom Passy to come to the river and water their horses. This inclined\nplane was suppressed later on, for the sake of symmetry; horses may die\nof thirst, but the eye is gratified.\n\nIt is probable that the man in the blouse had intended to ascend this\ninclined plane, with a view to making his escape into the\nChamps-Élysées, a place ornamented with trees, but, in return, much\ninfested with policemen, and where the other could easily exercise\nviolence.\n\nThis point on the quay is not very far distant from the house brought\nto Paris from Moret in 1824, by Colonel Brack, and designated as “the\nhouse of François I.” A guard house is situated close at hand.\n\nTo the great surprise of his watcher, the man who was being tracked did\nnot mount by the inclined plane for watering. He continued to advance\nalong the quay on the shore.\n\nHis position was visibly becoming critical.\n\nWhat was he intending to do, if not to throw himself into the Seine?\n\nHenceforth, there existed no means of ascending to the quay; there was\nno other inclined plane, no staircase; and they were near the spot,\nmarked by the bend in the Seine towards the Pont de Jéna, where the\nbank, growing constantly narrower, ended in a slender tongue, and was\nlost in the water. There he would inevitably find himself blocked\nbetween the perpendicular wall on his right, the river on his left and\nin front of him, and the authorities on his heels.\n\nIt is true that this termination of the shore was hidden from sight by\na heap of rubbish six or seven feet in height, produced by some\ndemolition or other. But did this man hope to conceal himself\neffectually behind that heap of rubbish, which one need but skirt? The\nexpedient would have been puerile. He certainly was not dreaming of\nsuch a thing. The innocence of thieves does not extend to that point.\n\nThe pile of rubbish formed a sort of projection at the water’s edge,\nwhich was prolonged in a promontory as far as the wall of the quay.\n\nThe man who was being followed arrived at this little mound and went\nround it, so that he ceased to be seen by the other.\n\nThe latter, as he did not see, could not be seen; he took advantage of\nthis fact to abandon all dissimulation and to walk very rapidly. In a\nfew moments, he had reached the rubbish heap and passed round it. There\nhe halted in sheer amazement. The man whom he had been pursuing was no\nlonger there.\n\nTotal eclipse of the man in the blouse.\n\nThe shore, beginning with the rubbish heap, was only about thirty paces\nlong, then it plunged into the water which beat against the wall of the\nquay. The fugitive could not have thrown himself into the Seine without\nbeing seen by the man who was following him. What had become of him?\n\nThe man in the buttoned-up coat walked to the extremity of the shore,\nand remained there in thought for a moment, his fists clenched, his\neyes searching. All at once he smote his brow. He had just perceived,\nat the point where the land came to an end and the water began, a large\niron grating, low, arched, garnished with a heavy lock and with three\nmassive hinges. This grating, a sort of door pierced at the base of the\nquay, opened on the river as well as on the shore. A blackish stream\npassed under it. This stream discharged into the Seine.\n\nBeyond the heavy, rusty iron bars, a sort of dark and vaulted corridor\ncould be descried. The man folded his arms and stared at the grating\nwith an air of reproach.\n\nAs this gaze did not suffice, he tried to thrust it aside; he shook it,\nit resisted solidly. It is probable that it had just been opened,\nalthough no sound had been heard, a singular circumstance in so rusty a\ngrating; but it is certain that it had been closed again. This\nindicated that the man before whom that door had just opened had not a\nhook but a key.\n\nThis evidence suddenly burst upon the mind of the man who was trying to\nmove the grating, and evoked from him this indignant ejaculation:\n\n“That is too much! A government key!”\n\n\nThen, immediately regaining his composure, he expressed a whole world\nof interior ideas by this outburst of monosyllables accented almost\nironically: “Come! Come! Come! Come!”\n\n\nThat said, and in the hope of something or other, either that he should\nsee the man emerge or other men enter, he posted himself on the watch\nbehind a heap of rubbish, with the patient rage of a pointer.\n\nThe hackney-coach, which regulated all its movements on his, had, in\nits turn, halted on the quay above him, close to the parapet. The\ncoachman, foreseeing a prolonged wait, encased his horses’ muzzles in\nthe bag of oats which is damp at the bottom, and which is so familiar\nto Parisians, to whom, be it said in parenthesis, the Government\nsometimes applies it. The rare passers-by on the Pont de Jéna turned\ntheir heads, before they pursued their way, to take a momentary glance\nat these two motionless items in the landscape, the man on the shore,\nthe carriage on the quay.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—HE ALSO BEARS HIS CROSS\n\n\nJean Valjean had resumed his march and had not again paused.\n\nThis march became more and more laborious. The level of these vaults\nvaries; the average height is about five feet, six inches, and has been\ncalculated for the stature of a man; Jean Valjean was forced to bend\nover, in order not to strike Marius against the vault; at every step he\nhad to bend, then to rise, and to feel incessantly of the wall. The\nmoisture of the stones, and the viscous nature of the timber framework\nfurnished but poor supports to which to cling, either for hand or foot.\nHe stumbled along in the hideous dung-heap of the city. The\nintermittent gleams from the air-holes only appeared at very long\nintervals, and were so wan that the full sunlight seemed like the light\nof the moon; all the rest was mist, miasma, opaqueness, blackness. Jean\nValjean was both hungry and thirsty; especially thirsty; and this, like\nthe sea, was a place full of water where a man cannot drink. His\nstrength, which was prodigious, as the reader knows, and which had been\nbut little decreased by age, thanks to his chaste and sober life, began\nto give way, nevertheless. Fatigue began to gain on him; and as his\nstrength decreased, it made the weight of his burden increase. Marius,\nwho was, perhaps, dead, weighed him down as inert bodies weigh. Jean\nValjean held him in such a manner that his chest was not oppressed, and\nso that respiration could proceed as well as possible. Between his legs\nhe felt the rapid gliding of the rats. One of them was frightened to\nsuch a degree that he bit him. From time to time, a breath of fresh air\nreached him through the vent-holes of the mouths of the sewer, and\nreanimated him.\n\nIt might have been three hours past midday when he reached the\nbelt-sewer.\n\nHe was, at first, astonished at this sudden widening. He found himself,\nall at once, in a gallery where his outstretched hands could not reach\nthe two walls, and beneath a vault which his head did not touch. The\nGrand Sewer is, in fact, eight feet wide and seven feet high.\n\nAt the point where the Montmartre sewer joins the Grand Sewer, two\nother subterranean galleries, that of the Rue de Provence, and that of\nthe Abattoir, form a square. Between these four ways, a less sagacious\nman would have remained undecided. Jean Valjean selected the broadest,\nthat is to say, the belt-sewer. But here the question again came\nup—should he descend or ascend? He thought that the situation required\nhaste, and that he must now gain the Seine at any risk. In other terms,\nhe must descend. He turned to the left.\n\nIt was well that he did so, for it is an error to suppose that the\nbelt-sewer has two outlets, the one in the direction of Bercy, the\nother towards Passy, and that it is, as its name indicates, the\nsubterranean girdle of the Paris on the right bank. The Grand Sewer,\nwhich is, it must be remembered, nothing else than the old brook of\nMénilmontant, terminates, if one ascends it, in a blind sack, that is\nto say, at its ancient point of departure which was its source, at the\nfoot of the knoll of Ménilmontant. There is no direct communication\nwith the branch which collects the waters of Paris beginning with the\nQuartier Popincourt, and which falls into the Seine through the Amelot\nsewer above the ancient Isle Louviers. This branch, which completes the\ncollecting sewer, is separated from it, under the Rue Ménilmontant\nitself, by a pile which marks the dividing point of the waters, between\nupstream and downstream. If Jean Valjean had ascended the gallery he\nwould have arrived, after a thousand efforts, and broken down with\nfatigue, and in an expiring condition, in the gloom, at a wall. He\nwould have been lost.\n\nIn case of necessity, by retracing his steps a little way, and entering\nthe passage of the Filles-du-Calvaire, on condition that he did not\nhesitate at the subterranean crossing of the Carrefour Boucherat, and\nby taking the corridor Saint-Louis, then the Saint-Gilles gut on the\nleft, then turning to the right and avoiding the Saint-Sebastian\ngallery, he might have reached the Amelot sewer, and thence, provided\nthat he did not go astray in the sort of F which lies under the\nBastille, he might have attained the outlet on the Seine near the\nArsenal. But in order to do this, he must have been thoroughly familiar\nwith the enormous madrepore of the sewer in all its ramifications and\nin all its openings. Now, we must again insist that he knew nothing of\nthat frightful drain which he was traversing; and had any one asked him\nin what he was, he would have answered: “In the night.”\n\n\nHis instinct served him well. To descend was, in fact, possible safety.\n\nHe left on his right the two narrow passages which branch out in the\nform of a claw under the Rue Laffitte and the Rue Saint-Georges and the\nlong, bifurcated corridor of the Chaussée d’Antin.\n\nA little beyond an affluent, which was, probably, the Madeleine branch,\nhe halted. He was extremely weary. A passably large air-hole, probably\nthe man-hole in the Rue d’Anjou, furnished a light that was almost\nvivid. Jean Valjean, with the gentleness of movement which a brother\nwould exercise towards his wounded brother, deposited Marius on the\nbanquette of the sewer. Marius’ blood-stained face appeared under the\nwan light of the air-hole like the ashes at the bottom of a tomb. His\neyes were closed, his hair was plastered down on his temples like a\npainter’s brushes dried in red wash; his hands hung limp and dead. A\nclot of blood had collected in the knot of his cravat; his limbs were\ncold, and blood was clotted at the corners of his mouth; his shirt had\nthrust itself into his wounds, the cloth of his coat was chafing the\nyawning gashes in the living flesh. Jean Valjean, pushing aside the\ngarments with the tips of his fingers, laid his hand upon Marius’\nbreast; his heart was still beating. Jean Valjean tore up his shirt,\nbandaged the young man’s wounds as well as he was able and stopped the\nflowing blood; then bending over Marius, who still lay unconscious and\nalmost without breathing, in that half light, he gazed at him with\ninexpressible hatred.\n\nOn disarranging Marius’ garments, he had found two things in his\npockets, the roll which had been forgotten there on the preceding\nevening, and Marius’ pocketbook. He ate the roll and opened the\npocketbook. On the first page he found the four lines written by\nMarius. The reader will recall them:\n\n“My name is Marius Pontmercy. Carry my body to my grandfather, M.\nGillenormand, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the Marais.”\n\n\nJean Valjean read these four lines by the light of the air-hole, and\nremained for a moment as though absorbed in thought, repeating in a low\ntone: “Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, number 6, Monsieur Gillenormand.” He\nreplaced the pocketbook in Marius’ pocket. He had eaten, his strength\nhad returned to him; he took Marius up once more upon his back, placed\nthe latter’s head carefully on his right shoulder, and resumed his\ndescent of the sewer.\n\nThe Grand Sewer, directed according to the course of the valley of\nMénilmontant, is about two leagues long. It is paved throughout a\nnotable portion of its extent.\n\nThis torch of the names of the streets of Paris, with which we are\nilluminating for the reader Jean Valjean’s subterranean march, Jean\nValjean himself did not possess. Nothing told him what zone of the city\nhe was traversing, nor what way he had made. Only the growing pallor of\nthe pools of light which he encountered from time to time indicated to\nhim that the sun was withdrawing from the pavement, and that the day\nwould soon be over; and the rolling of vehicles overhead, having become\nintermittent instead of continuous, then having almost ceased, he\nconcluded that he was no longer under central Paris, and that he was\napproaching some solitary region, in the vicinity of the outer\nboulevards, or the extreme outer quays. Where there are fewer houses\nand streets, the sewer has fewer air-holes. The gloom deepened around\nJean Valjean. Nevertheless, he continued to advance, groping his way in\nthe dark.\n\nSuddenly this darkness became terrible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—IN THE CASE OF SAND AS IN THAT OF WOMAN, THERE IS A FINENESS\nWHICH IS TREACHEROUS\n\n\nHe felt that he was entering the water, and that he no longer had a\npavement under his feet, but only mud.\n\nIt sometimes happens, that on certain shores of Bretagne or Scotland a\nman, either a traveller or a fisherman, while walking at low tide on\nthe beach far from shore, suddenly notices that for several minutes\npast, he has been walking with some difficulty. The beach under foot is\nlike pitch; his soles stick fast to it; it is no longer sand, it is\nbird-lime. The strand is perfectly dry, but at every step that he\ntakes, as soon as the foot is raised, the print is filled with water.\nThe eye, however, has perceived no change; the immense beach is smooth\nand tranquil, all the sand has the same aspect, nothing distinguishes\nthe soil that is solid from that which is not solid; the joyous little\ncloud of sand-lice continues to leap tumultuously under the feet of the\npasser-by.\n\nThe man pursues his way, he walks on, turns towards the land, endeavors\nto approach the shore. He is not uneasy. Uneasy about what? Only he is\nconscious that the heaviness of his feet seems to be increasing at\nevery step that he takes. All at once he sinks in. He sinks in two or\nthree inches. Decidedly, he is not on the right road; he halts to get\nhis bearings. Suddenly he glances at his feet; his feet have\ndisappeared. The sand has covered them. He draws his feet out of the\nsand, he tries to retrace his steps, he turns back, he sinks in more\ndeeply than before. The sand is up to his ankles, he tears himself free\nfrom it and flings himself to the left, the sand reaches to mid-leg, he\nflings himself to the right, the sand comes up to his knees. Then, with\nindescribable terror, he recognizes the fact that he is caught in a\nquicksand, and that he has beneath him that frightful medium in which\nneither man can walk nor fish can swim. He flings away his burden, if\nhe have one, he lightens himself, like a ship in distress; it is too\nlate, the sand is above his knees.\n\nHe shouts, he waves his hat, or his handkerchief, the sand continually\ngains on him; if the beach is deserted, if the land is too far away, if\nthe bank of sand is too ill-famed, there is no hero in the\nneighborhood, all is over, he is condemned to be engulfed. He is\ncondemned to that terrible interment, long, infallible, implacable,\nwhich it is impossible to either retard or hasten, which lasts for\nhours, which will not come to an end, which seizes you erect, free, in\nthe flush of health, which drags you down by the feet, which, at every\neffort that you attempt, at every shout that you utter, draws you a\nlittle lower, which has the air of punishing you for your resistance by\na redoubled grasp, which forces a man to return slowly to earth, while\nleaving him time to survey the horizon, the trees, the verdant country,\nthe smoke of the villages on the plain, the sails of the ships on the\nsea, the birds which fly and sing, the sun and the sky. This engulfment\nis the sepulchre which assumes a tide, and which mounts from the depths\nof the earth towards a living man. Each minute is an inexorable\nlayer-out of the dead. The wretched man tries to sit down, to lie down,\nto climb; every movement that he makes buries him deeper; he\nstraightens himself up, he sinks; he feels that he is being swallowed\nup; he shrieks, implores, cries to the clouds, wrings his hands, grows\ndesperate. Behold him in the sand up to his belly, the sand reaches to\nhis breast, he is only a bust now. He uplifts his hands, utters furious\ngroans, clenches his nails on the beach, tries to cling fast to that\nashes, supports himself on his elbows in order to raise himself from\nthat soft sheath, and sobs frantically; the sand mounts higher. The\nsand has reached his shoulders, the sand reaches to his throat; only\nhis face is visible now. His mouth cries aloud, the sand fills it;\nsilence. His eyes still gaze forth, the sand closes them, night. Then\nhis brow decreases, a little hair quivers above the sand; a hand\nprojects, pierces the surface of the beach, waves and disappears.\nSinister obliteration of a man.\n\nSometimes a rider is engulfed with his horse; sometimes the carter is\nswallowed up with his cart; all founders in that strand. It is\nshipwreck elsewhere than in the water. It is the earth drowning a man.\nThe earth, permeated with the ocean, becomes a pitfall. It presents\nitself in the guise of a plain, and it yawns like a wave. The abyss is\nsubject to these treacheries.\n\nThis melancholy fate, always possible on certain sea beaches, was also\npossible, thirty years ago, in the sewers of Paris.\n\nBefore the important works, undertaken in 1833, the subterranean drain\nof Paris was subject to these sudden slides.\n\nThe water filtered into certain subjacent strata, which were\nparticularly friable; the foot-way, which was of flag-stones, as in the\nancient sewers, or of cement on concrete, as in the new galleries,\nhaving no longer an underpinning, gave way. A fold in a flooring of\nthis sort means a crack, means crumbling. The framework crumbled away\nfor a certain length. This crevice, the hiatus of a gulf of mire, was\ncalled a _fontis_, in the special tongue. What is a _fontis?_ It is the\nquicksands of the seashore suddenly encountered under the surface of\nthe earth; it is the beach of Mont Saint-Michel in a sewer. The soaked\nsoil is in a state of fusion, as it were; all its molecules are in\nsuspension in soft medium; it is not earth and it is not water. The\ndepth is sometimes very great. Nothing can be more formidable than such\nan encounter. If the water predominates, death is prompt, the man is\nswallowed up; if earth predominates, death is slow.\n\nCan any one picture to himself such a death? If being swallowed by the\nearth is terrible on the seashore, what is it in a cesspool? Instead of\nthe open air, the broad daylight, the clear horizon, those vast sounds,\nthose free clouds whence rains life, instead of those barks descried in\nthe distance, of that hope under all sorts of forms, of probable\npassers-by, of succor possible up to the very last moment,—instead of\nall this, deafness, blindness, a black vault, the inside of a tomb\nalready prepared, death in the mire beneath a cover! slow suffocation\nby filth, a stone box where asphyxia opens its claw in the mire and\nclutches you by the throat; fetidness mingled with the death-rattle;\nslime instead of the strand, sulfuretted hydrogen in place of the\nhurricane, dung in place of the ocean! And to shout, to gnash one’s\nteeth, and to writhe, and to struggle, and to agonize, with that\nenormous city which knows nothing of it all, over one’s head!\n\nInexpressible is the horror of dying thus! Death sometimes redeems his\natrocity by a certain terrible dignity. On the funeral pile, in\nshipwreck, one can be great; in the flames as in the foam, a superb\nattitude is possible; one there becomes transfigured as one perishes.\nBut not here. Death is filthy. It is humiliating to expire. The supreme\nfloating visions are abject. Mud is synonymous with shame. It is petty,\nugly, infamous. To die in a butt of Malvoisie, like Clarence, is\npermissible; in the ditch of a scavenger, like Escoubleau, is horrible.\nTo struggle therein is hideous; at the same time that one is going\nthrough the death agony, one is floundering about. There are shadows\nenough for hell, and mire enough to render it nothing but a slough, and\nthe dying man knows not whether he is on the point of becoming a\nspectre or a frog.\n\nEverywhere else the sepulchre is sinister; here it is deformed.\n\nThe depth of the _fontis_ varied, as well as their length and their\ndensity, according to the more or less bad quality of the sub-soil.\nSometimes a _fontis_ was three or four feet deep, sometimes eight or\nten; sometimes the bottom was unfathomable. Here the mire was almost\nsolid, there almost liquid. In the Lunière fontis, it would have taken\na man a day to disappear, while he would have been devoured in five\nminutes by the Philippeaux slough. The mire bears up more or less,\naccording to its density. A child can escape where a man will perish.\nThe first law of safety is to get rid of every sort of load. Every\nsewerman who felt the ground giving way beneath him began by flinging\naway his sack of tools, or his back-basket, or his hod.\n\nThe fontis were due to different causes: the friability of the soil;\nsome landslip at a depth beyond the reach of man; the violent summer\nrains; the incessant flooding of winter; long, drizzling showers.\nSometimes the weight of the surrounding houses on a marly or sandy soil\nforced out the vaults of the subterranean galleries and caused them to\nbend aside, or it chanced that a flooring vault burst and split under\nthis crushing thrust. In this manner, the heaping up of the Parthénon,\nobliterated, a century ago, a portion of the vaults of Saint-Geneviève\nhill. When a sewer was broken in under the pressure of the houses, the\nmischief was sometimes betrayed in the street above by a sort of space,\nlike the teeth of a saw, between the paving-stones; this crevice was\ndeveloped in an undulating line throughout the entire length of the\ncracked vault, and then, the evil being visible, the remedy could be\npromptly applied. It also frequently happened, that the interior\nravages were not revealed by any external scar, and in that case, woe\nto the sewermen. When they entered without precaution into the sewer,\nthey were liable to be lost. Ancient registers make mention of several\nscavengers who were buried in fontis in this manner. They give many\nnames; among others, that of the sewerman who was swallowed up in a\nquagmire under the man-hole of the Rue Carême-Prenant, a certain Blaise\nPoutrain; this Blaise Poutrain was the brother of Nicholas Poutrain,\nwho was the last grave-digger of the cemetery called the Charnier des\nInnocents, in 1785, the epoch when that cemetery expired.\n\nThere was also that young and charming Vicomte d’Escoubleau, of whom we\nhave just spoken, one of the heroes of the siege of Lérida, where they\ndelivered the assault in silk stockings, with violins at their head.\nD’Escoubleau, surprised one night at his cousin’s, the Duchesse de\nSourdis’, was drowned in a quagmire of the Beautreillis sewer, in which\nhe had taken refuge in order to escape from the Duke. Madame de\nSourdis, when informed of his death, demanded her smelling-bottle, and\nforgot to weep, through sniffling at her salts. In such cases, there is\nno love which holds fast; the sewer extinguishes it. Hero refuses to\nwash the body of Leander. Thisbe stops her nose in the presence of\nPyramus and says: “Phew!”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—THE FONTIS\n\n\nJean Valjean found himself in the presence of a fontis.\n\nThis sort of quagmire was common at that period in the subsoil of the\nChamps-Élysées, difficult to handle in the hydraulic works and a bad\npreservative of the subterranean constructions, on account of its\nexcessive fluidity. This fluidity exceeds even the inconsistency of the\nsands of the Quartier Saint-Georges, which could only be conquered by a\nstone construction on a concrete foundation, and the clayey strata,\ninfected with gas, of the Quartier des Martyrs, which are so liquid\nthat the only way in which a passage was effected under the gallery des\nMartyrs was by means of a cast-iron pipe. When, in 1836, the old stone\nsewer beneath the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, in which we now see Jean\nValjean, was demolished for the purpose of reconstructing it, the\nquicksand, which forms the subsoil of the Champs-Élysées as far as the\nSeine, presented such an obstacle, that the operation lasted nearly six\nmonths, to the great clamor of the dwellers on the riverside,\nparticularly those who had hotels and carriages. The work was more than\nunhealthy; it was dangerous. It is true that they had four months and a\nhalf of rain, and three floods of the Seine.\n\nThe fontis which Jean Valjean had encountered was caused by the\ndownpour of the preceding day. The pavement, badly sustained by the\nsubjacent sand, had given way and had produced a stoppage of the water.\nInfiltration had taken place, a slip had followed. The dislocated\nbottom had sunk into the ooze. To what extent? Impossible to say. The\nobscurity was more dense there than elsewhere. It was a pit of mire in\na cavern of night.\n\nJean Valjean felt the pavement vanishing beneath his feet. He entered\nthis slime. There was water on the surface, slime at the bottom. He\nmust pass it. To retrace his steps was impossible. Marius was dying,\nand Jean Valjean exhausted. Besides, where was he to go? Jean Valjean\nadvanced. Moreover, the pit seemed, for the first few steps, not to be\nvery deep. But in proportion as he advanced, his feet plunged deeper.\nSoon he had the slime up to his calves and water above his knees. He\nwalked on, raising Marius in his arms, as far above the water as he\ncould. The mire now reached to his knees, and the water to his waist.\nHe could no longer retreat. This mud, dense enough for one man, could\nnot, obviously, uphold two. Marius and Jean Valjean would have stood a\nchance of extricating themselves singly. Jean Valjean continued to\nadvance, supporting the dying man, who was, perhaps, a corpse.\n\nThe water came up to his arm-pits; he felt that he was sinking; it was\nonly with difficulty that he could move in the depth of ooze which he\nhad now reached. The density, which was his support, was also an\nobstacle. He still held Marius on high, and with an unheard-of\nexpenditure of force, he advanced still; but he was sinking. He had\nonly his head above the water now and his two arms holding up Marius.\nIn the old paintings of the deluge there is a mother holding her child\nthus.\n\nHe sank still deeper, he turned his face to the rear, to escape the\nwater, and in order that he might be able to breathe; anyone who had\nseen him in that gloom would have thought that what he beheld was a\nmask floating on the shadows; he caught a faint glimpse above him of\nthe drooping head and livid face of Marius; he made a desperate effort\nand launched his foot forward; his foot struck something solid; a point\nof support. It was high time.\n\nHe straightened himself up, and rooted himself upon that point of\nsupport with a sort of fury. This produced upon him the effect of the\nfirst step in a staircase leading back to life.\n\nThe point of support, thus encountered in the mire at the supreme\nmoment, was the beginning of the other watershed of the pavement, which\nhad bent but had not given way, and which had curved under the water\nlike a plank and in a single piece. Well built pavements form a vault\nand possess this sort of firmness. This fragment of the vaulting,\npartly submerged, but solid, was a veritable inclined plane, and, once\non this plane, he was safe. Jean Valjean mounted this inclined plane\nand reached the other side of the quagmire.\n\nAs he emerged from the water, he came in contact with a stone and fell\nupon his knees. He reflected that this was but just, and he remained\nthere for some time, with his soul absorbed in words addressed to God.\n\nHe rose to his feet, shivering, chilled, foul-smelling, bowed beneath\nthe dying man whom he was dragging after him, all dripping with slime,\nand his soul filled with a strange light.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—ONE SOMETIMES RUNS AGROUND WHEN ONE FANCIES THAT ONE IS\nDISEMBARKING\n\n\nHe set out on his way once more.\n\nHowever, although he had not left his life in the fontis, he seemed to\nhave left his strength behind him there. That supreme effort had\nexhausted him. His lassitude was now such that he was obliged to pause\nfor breath every three or four steps, and lean against the wall. Once\nhe was forced to seat himself on the banquette in order to alter\nMarius’ position, and he thought that he should have to remain there.\nBut if his vigor was dead, his energy was not. He rose again.\n\nHe walked on desperately, almost fast, proceeded thus for a hundred\npaces, almost without drawing breath, and suddenly came in contact with\nthe wall. He had reached an elbow of the sewer, and, arriving at the\nturn with head bent down, he had struck the wall. He raised his eyes,\nand at the extremity of the vault, far, very far away in front of him,\nhe perceived a light. This time it was not that terrible light; it was\ngood, white light. It was daylight. Jean Valjean saw the outlet.\n\nA damned soul, who, in the midst of the furnace, should suddenly\nperceive the outlet of Gehenna, would experience what Jean Valjean\nfelt. It would fly wildly with the stumps of its burned wings towards\nthat radiant portal. Jean Valjean was no longer conscious of fatigue,\nhe no longer felt Marius’ weight, he found his legs once more of steel,\nhe ran rather than walked. As he approached, the outlet became more and\nmore distinctly defined. It was a pointed arch, lower than the vault,\nwhich gradually narrowed, and narrower than the gallery, which closed\nin as the vault grew lower. The tunnel ended like the interior of a\nfunnel; a faulty construction, imitated from the wickets of\npenitentiaries, logical in a prison, illogical in a sewer, and which\nhas since been corrected.\n\nJean Valjean reached the outlet.\n\nThere he halted.\n\nIt certainly was the outlet, but he could not get out.\n\nThe arch was closed by a heavy grating, and the grating, which, to all\nappearance, rarely swung on its rusty hinges, was clamped to its stone\njamb by a thick lock, which, red with rust, seemed like an enormous\nbrick. The keyhole could be seen, and the robust latch, deeply sunk in\nthe iron staple. The door was plainly double-locked. It was one of\nthose prison locks which old Paris was so fond of lavishing.\n\nBeyond the grating was the open air, the river, the daylight, the\nshore, very narrow but sufficient for escape. The distant quays, Paris,\nthat gulf in which one so easily hides oneself, the broad horizon,\nliberty. On the right, downstream, the bridge of Jéna was discernible,\non the left, upstream, the bridge of the Invalides; the place would\nhave been a propitious one in which to await the night and to escape.\nIt was one of the most solitary points in Paris; the shore which faces\nthe Grand-Caillou. Flies were entering and emerging through the bars of\nthe grating.\n\nIt might have been half-past eight o’clock in the evening. The day was\ndeclining.\n\nJean Valjean laid Marius down along the wall, on the dry portion of the\nvaulting, then he went to the grating and clenched both fists round the\nbars; the shock which he gave it was frenzied, but it did not move. The\ngrating did not stir. Jean Valjean seized the bars one after the other,\nin the hope that he might be able to tear away the least solid, and to\nmake of it a lever wherewith to raise the door or to break the lock.\nNot a bar stirred. The teeth of a tiger are not more firmly fixed in\ntheir sockets. No lever; no prying possible. The obstacle was\ninvincible. There was no means of opening the gate.\n\nMust he then stop there? What was he to do? What was to become of him?\nHe had not the strength to retrace his steps, to recommence the journey\nwhich he had already taken. Besides, how was he to again traverse that\nquagmire whence he had only extricated himself as by a miracle? And\nafter the quagmire, was there not the police patrol, which assuredly\ncould not be twice avoided? And then, whither was he to go? What\ndirection should he pursue? To follow the incline would not conduct him\nto his goal. If he were to reach another outlet, he would find it\nobstructed by a plug or a grating. Every outlet was, undoubtedly,\nclosed in that manner. Chance had unsealed the grating through which he\nhad entered, but it was evident that all the other sewer mouths were\nbarred. He had only succeeded in escaping into a prison.\n\nAll was over. Everything that Jean Valjean had done was useless.\nExhaustion had ended in failure.\n\nThey were both caught in the immense and gloomy web of death, and Jean\nValjean felt the terrible spider running along those black strands and\nquivering in the shadows. He turned his back to the grating, and fell\nupon the pavement, hurled to earth rather than seated, close to Marius,\nwho still made no movement, and with his head bent between his knees.\nThis was the last drop of anguish.\n\nOf what was he thinking during this profound depression? Neither of\nhimself nor of Marius. He was thinking of Cosette.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—THE TORN COAT-TAIL\n\n\nIn the midst of this prostration, a hand was laid on his shoulder, and\na low voice said to him:\n\n“Half shares.”\n\n\nSome person in that gloom? Nothing so closely resembles a dream as\ndespair. Jean Valjean thought that he was dreaming. He had heard no\nfootsteps. Was it possible? He raised his eyes.\n\nA man stood before him.\n\nThis man was clad in a blouse; his feet were bare; he held his shoes in\nhis left hand; he had evidently removed them in order to reach Jean\nValjean, without allowing his steps to be heard.\n\nJean Valjean did not hesitate for an instant. Unexpected as was this\nencounter, this man was known to him. The man was Thénardier.\n\nAlthough awakened, so to speak, with a start, Jean Valjean, accustomed\nto alarms, and steeled to unforeseen shocks that must be promptly\nparried, instantly regained possession of his presence of mind.\nMoreover, the situation could not be made worse, a certain degree of\ndistress is no longer capable of a crescendo, and Thénardier himself\ncould add nothing to this blackness of this night.\n\nA momentary pause ensued.\n\nThénardier, raising his right hand to a level with his forehead, formed\nwith it a shade, then he brought his eyelashes together, by screwing up\nhis eyes, a motion which, in connection with a slight contraction of\nthe mouth, characterizes the sagacious attention of a man who is\nendeavoring to recognize another man. He did not succeed. Jean Valjean,\nas we have just stated, had his back turned to the light, and he was,\nmoreover, so disfigured, so bemired, so bleeding that he would have\nbeen unrecognizable in full noonday. On the contrary, illuminated by\nthe light from the grating, a cellar light, it is true, livid, yet\nprecise in its lividness, Thénardier, as the energetic popular metaphor\nexpresses it, immediately “leaped into” Jean Valjean’s eyes. This\ninequality of conditions sufficed to assure some advantage to Jean\nValjean in that mysterious duel which was on the point of beginning\nbetween the two situations and the two men. The encounter took place\nbetween Jean Valjean veiled and Thénardier unmasked.\n\nJean Valjean immediately perceived that Thénardier did not recognize\nhim.\n\nThey surveyed each other for a moment in that half-gloom, as though\ntaking each other’s measure. Thénardier was the first to break the\nsilence.\n\n“How are you going to manage to get out?”\n\n\nJean Valjean made no reply. Thénardier continued:\n\n“It’s impossible to pick the lock of that gate. But still you must get\nout of this.”\n\n\n“That is true,” said Jean Valjean.\n\n“Well, half shares then.”\n\n\n“What do you mean by that?”\n\n\n“You have killed that man; that’s all right. I have the key.”\n\n\nThénardier pointed to Marius. He went on:\n\n“I don’t know you, but I want to help you. You must be a friend.”\n\n\nJean Valjean began to comprehend. Thénardier took him for an assassin.\n\nThénardier resumed:\n\n“Listen, comrade. You didn’t kill that man without looking to see what\nhe had in his pockets. Give me my half. I’ll open the door for you.”\n\n\nAnd half drawing from beneath his tattered blouse a huge key, he added:\n\n“Do you want to see how a key to liberty is made? Look here.”\n\n\nJean Valjean “remained stupid”—the expression belongs to the elder\nCorneille—to such a degree that he doubted whether what he beheld was\nreal. It was Providence appearing in horrible guise, and his good angel\nspringing from the earth in the form of Thénardier.\n\nThénardier thrust his fist into a large pocket concealed under his\nblouse, drew out a rope and offered it to Jean Valjean.\n\n“Hold on,” said he, “I’ll give you the rope to boot.”\n\n\n“What is the rope for?”\n\n\n“You will need a stone also, but you can find one outside. There’s a\nheap of rubbish.”\n\n\n“What am I to do with a stone?”\n\n\n“Idiot, you’ll want to sling that stiff into the river, you’ll need a\nstone and a rope, otherwise it would float on the water.”\n\n\nJean Valjean took the rope. There is no one who does not occasionally\naccept in this mechanical way.\n\nThénardier snapped his fingers as though an idea had suddenly occurred\nto him.\n\n“Ah, see here, comrade, how did you contrive to get out of that slough\nyonder? I haven’t dared to risk myself in it. Phew! you don’t smell\ngood.”\n\n\nAfter a pause he added:\n\n“I’m asking you questions, but you’re perfectly right not to answer.\nIt’s an apprenticeship against that cursed quarter of an hour before\nthe examining magistrate. And then, when you don’t talk at all, you run\nno risk of talking too loud. That’s no matter, as I can’t see your face\nand as I don’t know your name, you are wrong in supposing that I don’t\nknow who you are and what you want. I twig. You’ve broken up that\ngentleman a bit; now you want to tuck him away somewhere. The river,\nthat great hider of folly, is what you want. I’ll get you out of your\nscrape. Helping a good fellow in a pinch is what suits me to a hair.”\n\n\nWhile expressing his approval of Jean Valjean’s silence, he endeavored\nto force him to talk. He jostled his shoulder in an attempt to catch a\nsight of his profile, and he exclaimed, without, however, raising his\ntone:\n\n“Apropos of that quagmire, you’re a hearty animal. Why didn’t you toss\nthe man in there?”\n\n\nJean Valjean preserved silence.\n\nThénardier resumed, pushing the rag which served him as a cravat to the\nlevel of his Adam’s apple, a gesture which completes the capable air of\na serious man:\n\n“After all, you acted wisely. The workmen, when they come to-morrow to\nstop up that hole, would certainly have found the stiff abandoned\nthere, and it might have been possible, thread by thread, straw by\nstraw, to pick up the scent and reach you. Some one has passed through\nthe sewer. Who? Where did he get out? Was he seen to come out? The\npolice are full of cleverness. The sewer is treacherous and tells tales\nof you. Such a find is a rarity, it attracts attention, very few people\nmake use of the sewers for their affairs, while the river belongs to\neverybody. The river is the true grave. At the end of a month they fish\nup your man in the nets at Saint-Cloud. Well, what does one care for\nthat? It’s carrion! Who killed that man? Paris. And justice makes no\ninquiries. You have done well.”\n\n\nThe more loquacious Thénardier became, the more mute was Jean Valjean.\n\nAgain Thénardier shook him by the shoulder.\n\n“Now let’s settle this business. Let’s go shares. You have seen my key,\nshow me your money.”\n\n\nThénardier was haggard, fierce, suspicious, rather menacing, yet\namicable.\n\nThere was one singular circumstance; Thénardier’s manners were not\nsimple; he had not the air of being wholly at his ease; while affecting\nan air of mystery, he spoke low; from time to time he laid his finger\non his mouth, and muttered, “hush!” It was difficult to divine why.\nThere was no one there except themselves. Jean Valjean thought that\nother ruffians might possibly be concealed in some nook, not very far\noff, and that Thénardier did not care to share with them.\n\nThénardier resumed:\n\n“Let’s settle up. How much did the stiff have in his bags?”\n\n\nJean Valjean searched his pockets.\n\nIt was his habit, as the reader will remember, to always have some\nmoney about him. The mournful life of expedients to which he had been\ncondemned imposed this as a law upon him. On this occasion, however, he\nhad been caught unprepared. When donning his uniform of a National\nGuardsman on the preceding evening, he had forgotten, dolefully\nabsorbed as he was, to take his pocket-book. He had only some small\nchange in his fob. He turned out his pocket, all soaked with ooze, and\nspread out on the banquette of the vault one louis d’or, two five-franc\npieces, and five or six large sous.\n\nThénardier thrust out his lower lip with a significant twist of the\nneck.\n\n“You knocked him over cheap,” said he.\n\nHe set to feeling the pockets of Jean Valjean and Marius, with the\ngreatest familiarity. Jean Valjean, who was chiefly concerned in\nkeeping his back to the light, let him have his way.\n\nWhile handling Marius’ coat, Thénardier, with the skill of a\npickpocket, and without being noticed by Jean Valjean, tore off a strip\nwhich he concealed under his blouse, probably thinking that this morsel\nof stuff might serve, later on, to identify the assassinated man and\nthe assassin. However, he found no more than the thirty francs.\n\n“That’s true,” said he, “both of you together have no more than that.”\n\n\nAnd, forgetting his motto: “half shares,” he took all.\n\nHe hesitated a little over the large sous. After due reflection, he\ntook them also, muttering:\n\n“Never mind! You cut folks’ throats too cheap altogether.”\n\n\nThat done, he once more drew the big key from under his blouse.\n\n“Now, my friend, you must leave. It’s like the fair here, you pay when\nyou go out. You have paid, now clear out.”\n\n\nAnd he began to laugh.\n\nHad he, in lending to this stranger the aid of his key, and in making\nsome other man than himself emerge from that portal, the pure and\ndisinterested intention of rescuing an assassin? We may be permitted to\ndoubt this.\n\nThénardier helped Jean Valjean to replace Marius on his shoulders, then\nhe betook himself to the grating on tiptoe, and barefooted, making Jean\nValjean a sign to follow him, looked out, laid his finger on his mouth,\nand remained for several seconds, as though in suspense; his inspection\nfinished, he placed the key in the lock. The bolt slipped back and the\ngate swung open. It neither grated nor squeaked. It moved very softly.\n\nIt was obvious that this gate and those hinges, carefully oiled, were\nin the habit of opening more frequently than was supposed. This\nsoftness was suspicious; it hinted at furtive goings and comings,\nsilent entrances and exits of nocturnal men, and the wolf-like tread of\ncrime.\n\nThe sewer was evidently an accomplice of some mysterious band. This\ntaciturn grating was a receiver of stolen goods.\n\nThénardier opened the gate a little way, allowing just sufficient space\nfor Jean Valjean to pass out, closed the grating again, gave the key a\ndouble turn in the lock and plunged back into the darkness, without\nmaking any more noise than a breath. He seemed to walk with the velvet\npaws of a tiger.\n\nA moment later, that hideous providence had retreated into the\ninvisibility.\n\nJean Valjean found himself in the open air.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—MARIUS PRODUCES ON SOME ONE WHO IS A JUDGE OF THE MATTER,\nTHE EFFECT OF BEING DEAD\n\n\nHe allowed Marius to slide down upon the shore.\n\nThey were in the open air!\n\nThe miasmas, darkness, horror lay behind him. The pure, healthful,\nliving, joyous air that was easy to breathe inundated him. Everywhere\naround him reigned silence, but that charming silence when the sun has\nset in an unclouded azure sky. Twilight had descended; night was\ndrawing on, the great deliverer, the friend of all those who need a\nmantle of darkness that they may escape from an anguish. The sky\npresented itself in all directions like an enormous calm. The river\nflowed to his feet with the sound of a kiss. The aerial dialogue of the\nnests bidding each other good night in the elms of the Champs-Élysées\nwas audible. A few stars, daintily piercing the pale blue of the\nzenith, and visible to reverie alone, formed imperceptible little\nsplendors amid the immensity. Evening was unfolding over the head of\nJean Valjean all the sweetness of the infinite.\n\nIt was that exquisite and undecided hour which says neither yes nor no.\nNight was already sufficiently advanced to render it possible to lose\noneself at a little distance and yet there was sufficient daylight to\npermit of recognition at close quarters.\n\nFor several seconds, Jean Valjean was irresistibly overcome by that\naugust and caressing serenity; such moments of oblivion do come to men;\nsuffering refrains from harassing the unhappy wretch; everything is\neclipsed in the thoughts; peace broods over the dreamer like night;\nand, beneath the twilight which beams and in imitation of the sky which\nis illuminated, the soul becomes studded with stars. Jean Valjean could\nnot refrain from contemplating that vast, clear shadow which rested\nover him; thoughtfully he bathed in the sea of ecstasy and prayer in\nthe majestic silence of the eternal heavens. Then he bent down swiftly\nto Marius, as though the sentiment of duty had returned to him, and,\ndipping up water in the hollow of his hand, he gently sprinkled a few\ndrops on the latter’s face. Marius’ eyelids did not open; but his\nhalf-open mouth still breathed.\n\nJean Valjean was on the point of dipping his hand in the river once\nmore, when, all at once, he experienced an indescribable embarrassment,\nsuch as a person feels when there is some one behind him whom he does\nnot see.\n\nWe have already alluded to this impression, with which everyone is\nfamiliar.\n\nHe turned round.\n\nSome one was, in fact, behind him, as there had been a short while\nbefore.\n\nA man of lofty stature, enveloped in a long coat, with folded arms, and\nbearing in his right fist a bludgeon of which the leaden head was\nvisible, stood a few paces in the rear of the spot where Jean Valjean\nwas crouching over Marius.\n\nWith the aid of the darkness, it seemed a sort of apparition. An\nordinary man would have been alarmed because of the twilight, a\nthoughtful man on account of the bludgeon. Jean Valjean recognized\nJavert.\n\nThe reader has divined, no doubt, that Thénardier’s pursuer was no\nother than Javert. Javert, after his unlooked-for escape from the\nbarricade, had betaken himself to the prefecture of police, had\nrendered a verbal account to the Prefect in person in a brief audience,\nhad then immediately gone on duty again, which implied—the note, the\nreader will recollect, which had been captured on his person—a certain\nsurveillance of the shore on the right bank of the Seine near the\nChamps-Élysées, which had, for some time past, aroused the attention of\nthe police. There he had caught sight of Thénardier and had followed\nhim. The reader knows the rest.\n\nThus it will be easily understood that that grating, so obligingly\nopened to Jean Valjean, was a bit of cleverness on Thénardier’s part.\nThénardier intuitively felt that Javert was still there; the man spied\nupon has a scent which never deceives him; it was necessary to fling a\nbone to that sleuth-hound. An assassin, what a godsend! Such an\nopportunity must never be allowed to slip. Thénardier, by putting Jean\nValjean outside in his stead, provided a prey for the police, forced\nthem to relinquish his scent, made them forget him in a bigger\nadventure, repaid Javert for his waiting, which always flatters a spy,\nearned thirty francs, and counted with certainty, so far as he himself\nwas concerned, on escaping with the aid of this diversion.\n\nJean Valjean had fallen from one danger upon another.\n\nThese two encounters, this falling one after the other, from Thénardier\nupon Javert, was a rude shock.\n\nJavert did not recognize Jean Valjean, who, as we have stated, no\nlonger looked like himself. He did not unfold his arms, he made sure of\nhis bludgeon in his fist, by an imperceptible movement, and said in a\ncurt, calm voice:\n\n“Who are you?”\n\n\n“I.”\n\n\n“Who is ‘I’?”\n\n\n“Jean Valjean.”\n\n\nJavert thrust his bludgeon between his teeth, bent his knees, inclined\nhis body, laid his two powerful hands on the shoulders of Jean Valjean,\nwhich were clamped within them as in a couple of vices, scrutinized\nhim, and recognized him. Their faces almost touched. Javert’s look was\nterrible.\n\nJean Valjean remained inert beneath Javert’s grasp, like a lion\nsubmitting to the claws of a lynx.\n\n“Inspector Javert,” said he, “you have me in your power. Moreover, I\nhave regarded myself as your prisoner ever since this morning. I did\nnot give you my address with any intention of escaping from you. Take\nme. Only grant me one favor.”\n\n\nJavert did not appear to hear him. He kept his eyes riveted on Jean\nValjean. His chin being contracted, thrust his lips upwards towards his\nnose, a sign of savage reverie. At length he released Jean Valjean,\nstraightened himself stiffly up without bending, grasped his bludgeon\nagain firmly, and, as though in a dream, he murmured rather than\nuttered this question:\n\n“What are you doing here? And who is this man?”\n\n\nHe still abstained from addressing Jean Valjean as _thou_.\n\nJean Valjean replied, and the sound of his voice appeared to rouse\nJavert:\n\n“It is with regard to him that I desire to speak to you. Dispose of me\nas you see fit; but first help me to carry him home. That is all that I\nask of you.”\n\n\nJavert’s face contracted as was always the case when any one seemed to\nthink him capable of making a concession. Nevertheless, he did not say\n“no.”\n\n\nAgain he bent over, drew from his pocket a handkerchief which he\nmoistened in the water and with which he then wiped Marius’\nblood-stained brow.\n\n“This man was at the barricade,” said he in a low voice and as though\nspeaking to himself. “He is the one they called Marius.”\n\n\nA spy of the first quality, who had observed everything, listened to\neverything, and taken in everything, even when he thought that he was\nto die; who had played the spy even in his agony, and who, with his\nelbows leaning on the first step of the sepulchre, had taken notes.\n\nHe seized Marius’ hand and felt his pulse.\n\n“He is wounded,” said Jean Valjean.\n\n“He is a dead man,” said Javert.\n\nJean Valjean replied:\n\n“No. Not yet.”\n\n\n“So you have brought him thither from the barricade?” remarked Javert.\n\nHis preoccupation must indeed have been very profound for him not to\ninsist on this alarming rescue through the sewer, and for him not to\neven notice Jean Valjean’s silence after his question.\n\nJean Valjean, on his side, seemed to have but one thought. He resumed:\n\n“He lives in the Marais, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, with his\ngrandfather. I do not recollect his name.”\n\n\nJean Valjean fumbled in Marius’ coat, pulled out his pocket-book,\nopened it at the page which Marius had pencilled, and held it out to\nJavert.\n\nThere was still sufficient light to admit of reading. Besides this,\nJavert possessed in his eye the feline phosphorescence of night birds.\nHe deciphered the few lines written by Marius, and muttered:\n“Gillenormand, Rue des Filles-du Calvaire, No. 6.”\n\n\nThen he exclaimed: “Coachman!”\n\n\nThe reader will remember that the hackney-coach was waiting in case of\nneed.\n\nJavert kept Marius’ pocket-book.\n\nA moment later, the carriage, which had descended by the inclined plane\nof the watering-place, was on the shore. Marius was laid upon the back\nseat, and Javert seated himself on the front seat beside Jean Valjean.\n\nThe door slammed, and the carriage drove rapidly away, ascending the\nquays in the direction of the Bastille.\n\nThey quitted the quays and entered the streets. The coachman, a black\nform on his box, whipped up his thin horses. A glacial silence reigned\nin the carriage. Marius, motionless, with his body resting in the\ncorner, and his head drooping on his breast, his arms hanging, his legs\nstiff, seemed to be awaiting only a coffin; Jean Valjean seemed made of\nshadow, and Javert of stone, and in that vehicle full of night, whose\ninterior, every time that it passed in front of a street lantern,\nappeared to be turned lividly wan, as by an intermittent flash of\nlightning, chance had united and seemed to be bringing face to face the\nthree forms of tragic immobility, the corpse, the spectre, and the\nstatue.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X—RETURN OF THE SON WHO WAS PRODIGAL OF HIS LIFE\n\n\nAt every jolt over the pavement, a drop of blood trickled from Marius’\nhair.\n\nNight had fully closed in when the carriage arrived at No. 6, Rue des\nFilles-du-Calvaire.\n\nJavert was the first to alight; he made sure with one glance of the\nnumber on the carriage gate, and, raising the heavy knocker of beaten\niron, embellished in the old style, with a male goat and a satyr\nconfronting each other, he gave a violent peal. The gate opened a\nlittle way and Javert gave it a push. The porter half made his\nappearance yawning, vaguely awake, and with a candle in his hand.\n\nEveryone in the house was asleep. People go to bed betimes in the\nMarais, especially on days when there is a revolt. This good, old\nquarter, terrified at the Revolution, takes refuge in slumber, as\nchildren, when they hear the Bugaboo coming, hide their heads hastily\nunder their coverlet.\n\nIn the meantime Jean Valjean and the coachman had taken Marius out of\nthe carriage, Jean Valjean supporting him under the armpits, and the\ncoachman under the knees.\n\nAs they thus bore Marius, Jean Valjean slipped his hand under the\nlatter’s clothes, which were broadly rent, felt his breast, and assured\nhimself that his heart was still beating. It was even beating a little\nless feebly, as though the movement of the carriage had brought about a\ncertain fresh access of life.\n\nJavert addressed the porter in a tone befitting the government, and the\npresence of the porter of a factious person.\n\n“Some person whose name is Gillenormand?”\n\n\n“Here. What do you want with him?”\n\n\n“His son is brought back.”\n\n\n“His son?” said the porter stupidly.\n\n“He is dead.”\n\n\nJean Valjean, who, soiled and tattered, stood behind Javert, and whom\nthe porter was surveying with some horror, made a sign to him with his\nhead that this was not so.\n\nThe porter did not appear to understand either Javert’s words or Jean\nValjean’s sign.\n\nJavert continued:\n\n“He went to the barricade, and here he is.”\n\n\n“To the barricade?” ejaculated the porter.\n\n“He has got himself killed. Go waken his father.”\n\n\nThe porter did not stir.\n\n“Go along with you!” repeated Javert.\n\nAnd he added:\n\n“There will be a funeral here to-morrow.”\n\n\nFor Javert, the usual incidents of the public highway were\ncategorically classed, which is the beginning of foresight and\nsurveillance, and each contingency had its own compartment; all\npossible facts were arranged in drawers, as it were, whence they\nemerged on occasion, in variable quantities; in the street, uproar,\nrevolt, carnival, and funeral.\n\nThe porter contented himself with waking Basque. Basque woke Nicolette;\nNicolette roused great-aunt Gillenormand.\n\nAs for the grandfather, they let him sleep on, thinking that he would\nhear about the matter early enough in any case.\n\nMarius was carried up to the first floor, without any one in the other\nparts of the house being aware of the fact, and deposited on an old\nsofa in M. Gillenormand’s antechamber; and while Basque went in search\nof a physician, and while Nicolette opened the linen-presses, Jean\nValjean felt Javert touch him on the shoulder. He understood and\ndescended the stairs, having behind him the step of Javert who was\nfollowing him.\n\nThe porter watched them take their departure as he had watched their\narrival, in terrified somnolence.\n\nThey entered the carriage once more, and the coachman mounted his box.\n\n“Inspector Javert,” said Jean, “grant me yet another favor.”\n\n\n“What is it?” demanded Javert roughly.\n\n“Let me go home for one instant. Then you shall do whatever you like\nwith me.”\n\n\nJavert remained silent for a few moments, with his chin drawn back into\nthe collar of his great-coat, then he lowered the glass and front:\n\n“Driver,” said he, “Rue de l’Homme Armé, No. 7.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI—CONCUSSION IN THE ABSOLUTE\n\n\nThey did not open their lips again during the whole space of their\nride.\n\nWhat did Jean Valjean want? To finish what he had begun; to warn\nCosette, to tell her where Marius was, to give her, possibly, some\nother useful information, to take, if he could, certain final measures.\nAs for himself, so far as he was personally concerned, all was over; he\nhad been seized by Javert and had not resisted; any other man than\nhimself in like situation would, perhaps, have had some vague thoughts\nconnected with the rope which Thénardier had given him, and of the bars\nof the first cell that he should enter; but, let us impress it upon the\nreader, after the Bishop, there had existed in Jean Valjean a profound\nhesitation in the presence of any violence, even when directed against\nhimself.\n\nSuicide, that mysterious act of violence against the unknown which may\ncontain, in a measure, the death of the soul, was impossible to Jean\nValjean.\n\nAt the entrance to the Rue de l’Homme Armé, the carriage halted, the\nway being too narrow to admit of the entrance of vehicles. Javert and\nJean Valjean alighted.\n\nThe coachman humbly represented to “monsieur l’Inspecteur,” that the\nUtrecht velvet of his carriage was all spotted with the blood of the\nassassinated man, and with mire from the assassin. That is the way he\nunderstood it. He added that an indemnity was due him. At the same\ntime, drawing his certificate book from his pocket, he begged the\ninspector to have the goodness to write him “a bit of an attestation.”\n\n\nJavert thrust aside the book which the coachman held out to him, and\nsaid:\n\n“How much do you want, including your time of waiting and the drive?”\n\n\n“It comes to seven hours and a quarter,” replied the man, “and my\nvelvet was perfectly new. Eighty francs, Mr. Inspector.”\n\n\nJavert drew four napoleons from his pocket and dismissed the carriage.\n\nJean Valjean fancied that it was Javert’s intention to conduct him on\nfoot to the post of the Blancs-Manteaux or to the post of the Archives,\nboth of which are close at hand.\n\nThey entered the street. It was deserted as usual. Javert followed Jean\nValjean. They reached No. 7. Jean Valjean knocked. The door opened.\n\n“It is well,” said Javert. “Go upstairs.”\n\n\nHe added with a strange expression, and as though he were exerting an\neffort in speaking in this manner:\n\n“I will wait for you here.”\n\n\nJean Valjean looked at Javert. This mode of procedure was but little in\naccord with Javert’s habits. However, he could not be greatly surprised\nthat Javert should now have a sort of haughty confidence in him, the\nconfidence of the cat which grants the mouse liberty to the length of\nits claws, seeing that Jean Valjean had made up his mind to surrender\nhimself and to make an end of it. He pushed open the door, entered the\nhouse, called to the porter who was in bed and who had pulled the cord\nfrom his couch: “It is I!” and ascended the stairs.\n\nOn arriving at the first floor, he paused. All sorrowful roads have\ntheir stations. The window on the landing-place, which was a\nsash-window, was open. As in many ancient houses, the staircase got its\nlight from without and had a view on the street. The street-lantern,\nsituated directly opposite, cast some light on the stairs, and thus\neffected some economy in illumination.\n\nJean Valjean, either for the sake of getting the air, or mechanically,\nthrust his head out of this window. He leaned out over the street. It\nis short, and the lantern lighted it from end to end. Jean Valjean was\noverwhelmed with amazement; there was no longer any one there.\n\nJavert had taken his departure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII—THE GRANDFATHER\n\n\nBasque and the porter had carried Marius into the drawing-room, as he\nstill lay stretched out, motionless, on the sofa upon which he had been\nplaced on his arrival. The doctor who had been sent for had hastened\nthither. Aunt Gillenormand had risen.\n\nAunt Gillenormand went and came, in affright, wringing her hands and\nincapable of doing anything but saying: “Heavens! is it possible?” At\ntimes she added: “Everything will be covered with blood.” When her\nfirst horror had passed off, a certain philosophy of the situation\npenetrated her mind, and took form in the exclamation: “It was bound to\nend in this way!” She did not go so far as: “I told you so!” which is\ncustomary on this sort of occasion. At the physician’s orders, a camp\nbed had been prepared beside the sofa. The doctor examined Marius, and\nafter having found that his pulse was still beating, that the wounded\nman had no very deep wound on his breast, and that the blood on the\ncorners of his lips proceeded from his nostrils, he had him placed flat\non the bed, without a pillow, with his head on the same level as his\nbody, and even a trifle lower, and with his bust bare in order to\nfacilitate respiration. Mademoiselle Gillenormand, on perceiving that\nthey were undressing Marius, withdrew. She set herself to telling her\nbeads in her own chamber.\n\nThe trunk had not suffered any internal injury; a bullet, deadened by\nthe pocket-book, had turned aside and made the tour of his ribs with a\nhideous laceration, which was of no great depth, and consequently, not\ndangerous. The long, underground journey had completed the dislocation\nof the broken collar-bone, and the disorder there was serious. The arms\nhad been slashed with sabre cuts. Not a single scar disfigured his\nface; but his head was fairly covered with cuts; what would be the\nresult of these wounds on the head? Would they stop short at the hairy\ncuticle, or would they attack the brain? As yet, this could not be\ndecided. A grave symptom was that they had caused a swoon, and that\npeople do not always recover from such swoons. Moreover, the wounded\nman had been exhausted by hemorrhage. From the waist down, the\nbarricade had protected the lower part of the body from injury.\n\nBasque and Nicolette tore up linen and prepared bandages; Nicolette\nsewed them, Basque rolled them. As lint was lacking, the doctor, for\nthe time being, arrested the bleeding with layers of wadding. Beside\nthe bed, three candles burned on a table where the case of surgical\ninstruments lay spread out. The doctor bathed Marius’ face and hair\nwith cold water. A full pail was reddened in an instant. The porter,\ncandle in hand, lighted them.\n\nThe doctor seemed to be pondering sadly. From time to time, he made a\nnegative sign with his head, as though replying to some question which\nhe had inwardly addressed to himself.\n\nA bad sign for the sick man are these mysterious dialogues of the\ndoctor with himself.\n\nAt the moment when the doctor was wiping Marius’ face, and lightly\ntouching his still closed eyes with his finger, a door opened at the\nend of the drawing-room, and a long, pallid figure made its appearance.\n\nThis was the grandfather.\n\nThe revolt had, for the past two days, deeply agitated, enraged and\nengrossed the mind of M. Gillenormand. He had not been able to sleep on\nthe previous night, and he had been in a fever all day long. In the\nevening, he had gone to bed very early, recommending that everything in\nthe house should be well barred, and he had fallen into a doze through\nsheer fatigue.\n\nOld men sleep lightly; M. Gillenormand’s chamber adjoined the\ndrawing-room, and in spite of all the precautions that had been taken,\nthe noise had awakened him. Surprised at the rift of light which he saw\nunder his door, he had risen from his bed, and had groped his way\nthither.\n\nHe stood astonished on the threshold, one hand on the handle of the\nhalf-open door, with his head bent a little forward and quivering, his\nbody wrapped in a white dressing-gown, which was straight and as\ndestitute of folds as a winding-sheet; and he had the air of a phantom\nwho is gazing into a tomb.\n\nHe saw the bed, and on the mattress that young man, bleeding, white\nwith a waxen whiteness, with closed eyes and gaping mouth, and pallid\nlips, stripped to the waist, slashed all over with crimson wounds,\nmotionless and brilliantly lighted up.\n\nThe grandfather trembled from head to foot as powerfully as ossified\nlimbs can tremble, his eyes, whose corneæ were yellow on account of his\ngreat age, were veiled in a sort of vitreous glitter, his whole face\nassumed in an instant the earthy angles of a skull, his arms fell\npendent, as though a spring had broken, and his amazement was betrayed\nby the outspreading of the fingers of his two aged hands, which\nquivered all over, his knees formed an angle in front, allowing,\nthrough the opening in his dressing-gown, a view of his poor bare legs,\nall bristling with white hairs, and he murmured:\n\n“Marius!”\n\n\n“Sir,” said Basque, “Monsieur has just been brought back. He went to\nthe barricade, and....”\n\n\n“He is dead!” cried the old man in a terrible voice. “Ah! The rascal!”\n\n\nThen a sort of sepulchral transformation straightened up this\ncentenarian as erect as a young man.\n\n“Sir,” said he, “you are the doctor. Begin by telling me one thing. He\nis dead, is he not?”\n\n\nThe doctor, who was at the highest pitch of anxiety, remained silent.\n\nM. Gillenormand wrung his hands with an outburst of terrible laughter.\n\n“He is dead! He is dead! He is dead! He has got himself killed on the\nbarricades! Out of hatred to me! He did that to spite me! Ah! You\nblood-drinker! This is the way he returns to me! Misery of my life, he\nis dead!”\n\n\nHe went to the window, threw it wide open as though he were stifling,\nand, erect before the darkness, he began to talk into the street, to\nthe night:\n\n“Pierced, sabred, exterminated, slashed, hacked in pieces! Just look at\nthat, the villain! He knew well that I was waiting for him, and that I\nhad had his room arranged, and that I had placed at the head of my bed\nhis portrait taken when he was a little child! He knew well that he had\nonly to come back, and that I had been recalling him for years, and\nthat I remained by my fireside, with my hands on my knees, not knowing\nwhat to do, and that I was mad over it! You knew well, that you had but\nto return and to say: ‘It is I,’ and you would have been the master of\nthe house, and that I should have obeyed you, and that you could have\ndone whatever you pleased with your old numskull of a grandfather! you\nknew that well, and you said:\n\n“No, he is a Royalist, I will not go! And you went to the barricades,\nand you got yourself killed out of malice! To revenge yourself for what\nI said to you about Monsieur le Duc de Berry. It is infamous! Go to bed\nthen and sleep tranquilly! he is dead, and this is my awakening.”\n\n\nThe doctor, who was beginning to be uneasy in both quarters, quitted\nMarius for a moment, went to M. Gillenormand, and took his arm. The\ngrandfather turned round, gazed at him with eyes which seemed\nexaggerated in size and bloodshot, and said to him calmly:\n\n“I thank you, sir. I am composed, I am a man, I witnessed the death of\nLouis XVI., I know how to bear events. One thing is terrible and that\nis to think that it is your newspapers which do all the mischief. You\nwill have scribblers, chatterers, lawyers, orators, tribunes,\ndiscussions, progress, enlightenment, the rights of man, the liberty of\nthe press, and this is the way that your children will be brought home\nto you. Ah! Marius! It is abominable! Killed! Dead before me! A\nbarricade! Ah, the scamp! Doctor, you live in this quarter, I believe?\nOh! I know you well. I see your cabriolet pass my window. I am going to\ntell you. You are wrong to think that I am angry. One does not fly into\na rage against a dead man. That would be stupid. This is a child whom I\nhave reared. I was already old while he was very young. He played in\nthe Tuileries garden with his little shovel and his little chair, and\nin order that the inspectors might not grumble, I stopped up the holes\nthat he made in the earth with his shovel, with my cane. One day he\nexclaimed: Down with Louis XVIII.! and off he went. It was no fault of\nmine. He was all rosy and blond. His mother is dead. Have you ever\nnoticed that all little children are blond? Why is it so? He is the son\nof one of those brigands of the Loire, but children are innocent of\ntheir fathers’ crimes. I remember when he was no higher than that. He\ncould not manage to pronounce his Ds. He had a way of talking that was\nso sweet and indistinct that you would have thought it was a bird\nchirping. I remember that once, in front of the Hercules Farnese,\npeople formed a circle to admire him and marvel at him, he was so\nhandsome, was that child! He had a head such as you see in pictures. I\ntalked in a deep voice, and I frightened him with my cane, but he knew\nvery well that it was only to make him laugh. In the morning, when he\nentered my room, I grumbled, but he was like the sunlight to me, all\nthe same. One cannot defend oneself against those brats. They take hold\nof you, they hold you fast, they never let you go again. The truth is,\nthat there never was a cupid like that child. Now, what can you say for\nyour Lafayettes, your Benjamin Constants, and your Tirecuir de\nCorcelles who have killed him? This cannot be allowed to pass in this\nfashion.”\n\n\nHe approached Marius, who still lay livid and motionless, and to whom\nthe physician had returned, and began once more to wring his hands. The\nold man’s pallid lips moved as though mechanically, and permitted the\npassage of words that were barely audible, like breaths in the death\nagony:\n\n“Ah! heartless lad! Ah! clubbist! Ah! wretch! Ah! Septembrist!”\n\n\nReproaches in the low voice of an agonizing man, addressed to a corpse.\n\nLittle by little, as it is always indispensable that internal eruptions\nshould come to the light, the sequence of words returned, but the\ngrandfather appeared no longer to have the strength to utter them, his\nvoice was so weak, and extinct, that it seemed to come from the other\nside of an abyss:\n\n“It is all the same to me, I am going to die too, that I am. And to\nthink that there is not a hussy in Paris who would not have been\ndelighted to make this wretch happy! A scamp who, instead of amusing\nhimself and enjoying life, went off to fight and get himself shot down\nlike a brute! And for whom? Why? For the Republic! Instead of going to\ndance at the Chaumière, as it is the duty of young folks to do! What’s\nthe use of being twenty years old? The Republic, a cursed pretty folly!\nPoor mothers, beget fine boys, do! Come, he is dead. That will make two\nfunerals under the same carriage gate. So you have got yourself\narranged like this for the sake of General Lamarque’s handsome eyes!\nWhat had that General Lamarque done to you? A slasher! A chatter-box!\nTo get oneself killed for a dead man! If that isn’t enough to drive any\none mad! Just think of it! At twenty! And without so much as turning\nhis head to see whether he was not leaving something behind him! That’s\nthe way poor, good old fellows are forced to die alone, nowadays.\nPerish in your corner, owl! Well, after all, so much the better, that\nis what I was hoping for, this will kill me on the spot. I am too old,\nI am a hundred years old, I am a hundred thousand years old, I ought,\nby rights, to have been dead long ago. This blow puts an end to it. So\nall is over, what happiness! What is the good of making him inhale\nammonia and all that parcel of drugs? You are wasting your trouble, you\nfool of a doctor! Come, he’s dead, completely dead. I know all about\nit, I am dead myself too. He hasn’t done things by half. Yes, this age\nis infamous, infamous and that’s what I think of you, of your ideas, of\nyour systems, of your masters, of your oracles, of your doctors, of\nyour scape-graces of writers, of your rascally philosophers, and of all\nthe revolutions which, for the last sixty years, have been frightening\nthe flocks of crows in the Tuileries! But you were pitiless in getting\nyourself killed like this, I shall not even grieve over your death, do\nyou understand, you assassin?”\n\n\nAt that moment, Marius slowly opened his eyes, and his glance, still\ndimmed by lethargic wonder, rested on M. Gillenormand.\n\n“Marius!” cried the old man. “Marius! My little Marius! my child! my\nwell-beloved son! You open your eyes, you gaze upon me, you are alive,\nthanks!”\n\n\nAnd he fell fainting.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTH—JAVERT DERAILED\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nJavert passed slowly down the Rue de l’Homme Armé.\n\nHe walked with drooping head for the first time in his life, and\nlikewise, for the first time in his life, with his hands behind his\nback.\n\nUp to that day, Javert had borrowed from Napoleon’s attitudes, only\nthat which is expressive of resolution, with arms folded across the\nchest; that which is expressive of uncertainty—with the hands behind\nthe back—had been unknown to him. Now, a change had taken place; his\nwhole person, slow and sombre, was stamped with anxiety.\n\nHe plunged into the silent streets.\n\nNevertheless, he followed one given direction.\n\nHe took the shortest cut to the Seine, reached the Quai des Ormes,\nskirted the quay, passed the Grève, and halted at some distance from\nthe post of the Place du Châtelet, at the angle of the Pont Notre-Dame.\nThere, between the Notre-Dame and the Pont au Change on the one hand,\nand the Quai de la Mégisserie and the Quai aux Fleurs on the other, the\nSeine forms a sort of square lake, traversed by a rapid.\n\nThis point of the Seine is dreaded by mariners. Nothing is more\ndangerous than this rapid, hemmed in, at that epoch, and irritated by\nthe piles of the mill on the bridge, now demolished. The two bridges,\nsituated thus close together, augment the peril; the water hurries in\nformidable wise through the arches. It rolls in vast and terrible\nwaves; it accumulates and piles up there; the flood attacks the piles\nof the bridges as though in an effort to pluck them up with great\nliquid ropes. Men who fall in there never reappear; the best of\nswimmers are drowned there.\n\nJavert leaned both elbows on the parapet, his chin resting in both\nhands, and, while his nails were mechanically twined in the abundance\nof his whiskers, he meditated.\n\nA novelty, a revolution, a catastrophe had just taken place in the\ndepths of his being; and he had something upon which to examine\nhimself.\n\nJavert was undergoing horrible suffering.\n\nFor several hours, Javert had ceased to be simple. He was troubled;\nthat brain, so limpid in its blindness, had lost its transparency; that\ncrystal was clouded. Javert felt duty divided within his conscience,\nand he could not conceal the fact from himself. When he had so\nunexpectedly encountered Jean Valjean on the banks of the Seine, there\nhad been in him something of the wolf which regains his grip on his\nprey, and of the dog who finds his master again.\n\nHe beheld before him two paths, both equally straight, but he beheld\ntwo; and that terrified him; him, who had never in all his life known\nmore than one straight line. And, the poignant anguish lay in this,\nthat the two paths were contrary to each other. One of these straight\nlines excluded the other. Which of the two was the true one?\n\nHis situation was indescribable.\n\nTo owe his life to a malefactor, to accept that debt and to repay it;\nto be, in spite of himself, on a level with a fugitive from justice,\nand to repay his service with another service; to allow it to be said\nto him, “Go,” and to say to the latter in his turn: “Be free”; to\nsacrifice to personal motives duty, that general obligation, and to be\nconscious, in those personal motives, of something that was also\ngeneral, and, perchance, superior, to betray society in order to remain\ntrue to his conscience; that all these absurdities should be realized\nand should accumulate upon him,—this was what overwhelmed him.\n\nOne thing had amazed him,—this was that Jean Valjean should have done\nhim a favor, and one thing petrified him,—that he, Javert, should have\ndone Jean Valjean a favor.\n\nWhere did he stand? He sought to comprehend his position, and could no\nlonger find his bearings.\n\nWhat was he to do now? To deliver up Jean Valjean was bad; to leave\nJean Valjean at liberty was bad. In the first case, the man of\nauthority fell lower than the man of the galleys, in the second, a\nconvict rose above the law, and set his foot upon it. In both cases,\ndishonor for him, Javert. There was disgrace in any resolution at which\nhe might arrive. Destiny has some extremities which rise\nperpendicularly from the impossible, and beyond which life is no longer\nanything but a precipice. Javert had reached one of those extremities.\n\nOne of his anxieties consisted in being constrained to think. The very\nviolence of all these conflicting emotions forced him to it. Thought\nwas something to which he was unused, and which was peculiarly painful.\n\nIn thought there always exists a certain amount of internal rebellion;\nand it irritated him to have that within him.\n\nThought on any subject whatever, outside of the restricted circle of\nhis functions, would have been for him in any case useless and a\nfatigue; thought on the day which had just passed was a torture.\nNevertheless, it was indispensable that he should take a look into his\nconscience, after such shocks, and render to himself an account of\nhimself.\n\nWhat he had just done made him shudder. He, Javert, had seen fit to\ndecide, contrary to all the regulations of the police, contrary to the\nwhole social and judicial organization, contrary to the entire code,\nupon a release; this had suited him; he had substituted his own affairs\nfor the affairs of the public; was not this unjustifiable? Every time\nthat he brought himself face to face with this deed without a name\nwhich he had committed, he trembled from head to foot. Upon what should\nhe decide? One sole resource remained to him; to return in all haste to\nthe Rue de l’Homme Armé, and commit Jean Valjean to prison. It was\nclear that that was what he ought to do. He could not.\n\nSomething barred his way in that direction.\n\nSomething? What? Is there in the world, anything outside of the\ntribunals, executory sentences, the police and the authorities? Javert\nwas overwhelmed.\n\nA galley-slave sacred! A convict who could not be touched by the law!\nAnd that the deed of Javert!\n\nWas it not a fearful thing that Javert and Jean Valjean, the man made\nto proceed with vigor, the man made to submit,—that these two men who\nwere both the things of the law, should have come to such a pass, that\nboth of them had set themselves above the law? What then! such\nenormities were to happen and no one was to be punished! Jean Valjean,\nstronger than the whole social order, was to remain at liberty, and he,\nJavert, was to go on eating the government’s bread!\n\nHis reverie gradually became terrible.\n\nHe might, athwart this reverie, have also reproached himself on the\nsubject of that insurgent who had been taken to the Rue des\nFilles-du-Calvaire; but he never even thought of that. The lesser fault\nwas lost in the greater. Besides, that insurgent was, obviously, a dead\nman, and, legally, death puts an end to pursuit.\n\nJean Valjean was the load which weighed upon his spirit.\n\nJean Valjean disconcerted him. All the axioms which had served him as\npoints of support all his life long, had crumbled away in the presence\nof this man. Jean Valjean’s generosity towards him, Javert, crushed\nhim. Other facts which he now recalled, and which he had formerly\ntreated as lies and folly, now recurred to him as realities. M.\nMadeleine reappeared behind Jean Valjean, and the two figures were\nsuperposed in such fashion that they now formed but one, which was\nvenerable. Javert felt that something terrible was penetrating his\nsoul—admiration for a convict. Respect for a galley-slave—is that a\npossible thing? He shuddered at it, yet could not escape from it. In\nvain did he struggle, he was reduced to confess, in his inmost heart,\nthe sublimity of that wretch. This was odious.\n\nA benevolent malefactor, merciful, gentle, helpful, clement, a convict,\nreturning good for evil, giving back pardon for hatred, preferring pity\nto vengeance, preferring to ruin himself rather than to ruin his enemy,\nsaving him who had smitten him, kneeling on the heights of virtue, more\nnearly akin to an angel than to a man. Javert was constrained to admit\nto himself that this monster existed.\n\nThings could not go on in this manner.\n\nCertainly, and we insist upon this point, he had not yielded without\nresistance to that monster, to that infamous angel, to that hideous\nhero, who enraged almost as much as he amazed him. Twenty times, as he\nsat in that carriage face to face with Jean Valjean, the legal tiger\nhad roared within him. A score of times he had been tempted to fling\nhimself upon Jean Valjean, to seize him and devour him, that is to say,\nto arrest him. What more simple, in fact? To cry out at the first post\nthat they passed:—“Here is a fugitive from justice, who has broken his\nban!” to summon the gendarmes and say to them: “This man is yours!”\nthen to go off, leaving that condemned man there, to ignore the rest\nand not to meddle further in the matter. This man is forever a prisoner\nof the law; the law may do with him what it will. What could be more\njust? Javert had said all this to himself; he had wished to pass\nbeyond, to act, to apprehend the man, and then, as at present, he had\nnot been able to do it; and every time that his arm had been raised\nconvulsively towards Jean Valjean’s collar, his hand had fallen back\nagain, as beneath an enormous weight, and in the depths of his thought\nhe had heard a voice, a strange voice crying to him:—“It is well.\nDeliver up your savior. Then have the basin of Pontius Pilate brought\nand wash your claws.”\n\n\nThen his reflections reverted to himself and beside Jean Valjean\nglorified he beheld himself, Javert, degraded.\n\nA convict was his benefactor!\n\nBut then, why had he permitted that man to leave him alive? He had the\nright to be killed in that barricade. He should have asserted that\nright. It would have been better to summon the other insurgents to his\nsuccor against Jean Valjean, to get himself shot by force.\n\nHis supreme anguish was the loss of certainty. He felt that he had been\nuprooted. The code was no longer anything more than a stump in his\nhand. He had to deal with scruples of an unknown species. There had\ntaken place within him a sentimental revelation entirely distinct from\nlegal affirmation, his only standard of measurement hitherto. To remain\nin his former uprightness did not suffice. A whole order of unexpected\nfacts had cropped up and subjugated him. A whole new world was dawning\non his soul: kindness accepted and repaid, devotion, mercy, indulgence,\nviolences committed by pity on austerity, respect for persons, no more\ndefinitive condemnation, no more conviction, the possibility of a tear\nin the eye of the law, no one knows what justice according to God,\nrunning in inverse sense to justice according to men. He perceived amid\nthe shadows the terrible rising of an unknown moral sun; it horrified\nand dazzled him. An owl forced to the gaze of an eagle.\n\nHe said to himself that it was true that there were exceptional cases,\nthat authority might be put out of countenance, that the rule might be\ninadequate in the presence of a fact, that everything could not be\nframed within the text of the code, that the unforeseen compelled\nobedience, that the virtue of a convict might set a snare for the\nvirtue of the functionary, that destiny did indulge in such ambushes,\nand he reflected with despair that he himself had not even been\nfortified against a surprise.\n\nHe was forced to acknowledge that goodness did exist. This convict had\nbeen good. And he himself, unprecedented circumstance, had just been\ngood also. So he was becoming depraved.\n\nHe found that he was a coward. He conceived a horror of himself.\n\nJavert’s ideal, was not to be human, to be grand, to be sublime; it was\nto be irreproachable.\n\nNow, he had just failed in this.\n\nHow had he come to such a pass? How had all this happened? He could not\nhave told himself. He clasped his head in both hands, but in spite of\nall that he could do, he could not contrive to explain it to himself.\n\nHe had certainly always entertained the intention of restoring Jean\nValjean to the law of which Jean Valjean was the captive, and of which\nhe, Javert, was the slave. Not for a single instant while he held him\nin his grasp had he confessed to himself that he entertained the idea\nof releasing him. It was, in some sort, without his consciousness, that\nhis hand had relaxed and had let him go free.\n\nAll sorts of interrogation points flashed before his eyes. He put\nquestions to himself, and made replies to himself, and his replies\nfrightened him. He asked himself: “What has that convict done, that\ndesperate fellow, whom I have pursued even to persecution, and who has\nhad me under his foot, and who could have avenged himself, and who owed\nit both to his rancor and to his safety, in leaving me my life, in\nshowing mercy upon me? His duty? No. Something more. And I in showing\nmercy upon him in my turn—what have I done? My duty? No. Something\nmore. So there is something beyond duty?” Here he took fright; his\nbalance became disjointed; one of the scales fell into the abyss, the\nother rose heavenward, and Javert was no less terrified by the one\nwhich was on high than by the one which was below. Without being in the\nleast in the world what is called Voltairian or a philosopher, or\nincredulous, being, on the contrary, respectful by instinct, towards\nthe established church, he knew it only as an august fragment of the\nsocial whole; order was his dogma, and sufficed for him; ever since he\nhad attained to man’s estate and the rank of a functionary, he had\ncentred nearly all his religion in the police. Being,—and here we\nemploy words without the least irony and in their most serious\nacceptation, being, as we have said, a spy as other men are priests. He\nhad a superior, M. Gisquet; up to that day he had never dreamed of that\nother superior, God.\n\nThis new chief, God, he became unexpectedly conscious of, and he felt\nembarrassed by him. This unforeseen presence threw him off his\nbearings; he did not know what to do with this superior, he, who was\nnot ignorant of the fact that the subordinate is bound always to bow,\nthat he must not disobey, nor find fault, nor discuss, and that, in the\npresence of a superior who amazes him too greatly, the inferior has no\nother resource than that of handing in his resignation.\n\nBut how was he to set about handing in his resignation to God?\n\nHowever things might stand,—and it was to this point that he reverted\nconstantly,—one fact dominated everything else for him, and that was,\nthat he had just committed a terrible infraction of the law. He had\njust shut his eyes on an escaped convict who had broken his ban. He had\njust set a galley-slave at large. He had just robbed the laws of a man\nwho belonged to them. That was what he had done. He no longer\nunderstood himself. The very reasons for his action escaped him; only\ntheir vertigo was left with him. Up to that moment he had lived with\nthat blind faith which gloomy probity engenders. This faith had quitted\nhim, this probity had deserted him. All that he had believed in melted\naway. Truths which he did not wish to recognize were besieging him,\ninexorably. Henceforth, he must be a different man. He was suffering\nfrom the strange pains of a conscience abruptly operated on for the\ncataract. He saw that which it was repugnant to him to behold. He felt\nhimself emptied, useless, put out of joint with his past life, turned\nout, dissolved. Authority was dead within him. He had no longer any\nreason for existing.\n\nA terrible situation! to be touched.\n\nTo be granite and to doubt! to be the statue of Chastisement cast in\none piece in the mould of the law, and suddenly to become aware of the\nfact that one cherishes beneath one’s breast of bronze something absurd\nand disobedient which almost resembles a heart! To come to the pass of\nreturning good for good, although one has said to oneself up to that\nday that that good is evil! to be the watch-dog, and to lick the\nintruder’s hand! to be ice and melt! to be the pincers and to turn into\na hand! to suddenly feel one’s fingers opening! to relax one’s\ngrip,—what a terrible thing!\n\nThe man-projectile no longer acquainted with his route and retreating!\n\nTo be obliged to confess this to oneself: infallibility is not\ninfallible, there may exist error in the dogma, all has not been said\nwhen a code speaks, society is not perfect, authority is complicated\nwith vacillation, a crack is possible in the immutable, judges are but\nmen, the law may err, tribunals may make a mistake! to behold a rift in\nthe immense blue pane of the firmament!\n\nThat which was passing in Javert was the Fampoux of a rectilinear\nconscience, the derailment of a soul, the crushing of a probity which\nhad been irresistibly launched in a straight line and was breaking\nagainst God. It certainly was singular that the stoker of order, that\nthe engineer of authority, mounted on the blind iron horse with its\nrigid road, could be unseated by a flash of light! that the immovable,\nthe direct, the correct, the geometrical, the passive, the perfect,\ncould bend! that there should exist for the locomotive a road to\nDamascus!\n\nGod, always within man, and refractory, He, the true conscience, to the\nfalse; a prohibition to the spark to die out; an order to the ray to\nremember the sun; an injunction to the soul to recognize the veritable\nabsolute when confronted with the fictitious absolute, humanity which\ncannot be lost; the human heart indestructible; that splendid\nphenomenon, the finest, perhaps, of all our interior marvels, did\nJavert understand this? Did Javert penetrate it? Did Javert account for\nit to himself? Evidently he did not. But beneath the pressure of that\nincontestable incomprehensibility he felt his brain bursting.\n\nHe was less the man transfigured than the victim of this prodigy. In\nall this he perceived only the tremendous difficulty of existence. It\nseemed to him that, henceforth, his respiration was repressed forever.\nHe was not accustomed to having something unknown hanging over his\nhead.\n\nUp to this point, everything above him had been, to his gaze, merely a\nsmooth, limpid and simple surface; there was nothing incomprehensible,\nnothing obscure; nothing that was not defined, regularly disposed,\nlinked, precise, circumscribed, exact, limited, closed, fully provided\nfor; authority was a plane surface; there was no fall in it, no\ndizziness in its presence. Javert had never beheld the unknown except\nfrom below. The irregular, the unforeseen, the disordered opening of\nchaos, the possible slip over a precipice—this was the work of the\nlower regions, of rebels, of the wicked, of wretches. Now Javert threw\nhimself back, and he was suddenly terrified by this unprecedented\napparition: a gulf on high.\n\nWhat! one was dismantled from top to bottom! one was disconcerted,\nabsolutely! In what could one trust! That which had been agreed upon\nwas giving way! What! the defect in society’s armor could be discovered\nby a magnanimous wretch! What! an honest servitor of the law could\nsuddenly find himself caught between two crimes—the crime of allowing a\nman to escape and the crime of arresting him! everything was not\nsettled in the orders given by the State to the functionary! There\nmight be blind alleys in duty! What,—all this was real! was it true\nthat an ex-ruffian, weighed down with convictions, could rise erect and\nend by being in the right? Was this credible? were there cases in which\nthe law should retire before transfigured crime, and stammer its\nexcuses?—Yes, that was the state of the case! and Javert saw it! and\nJavert had touched it! and not only could he not deny it, but he had\ntaken part in it. These were realities. It was abominable that actual\nfacts could reach such deformity. If facts did their duty, they would\nconfine themselves to being proofs of the law; facts—it is God who\nsends them. Was anarchy, then, on the point of now descending from on\nhigh?\n\nThus,—and in the exaggeration of anguish, and the optical illusion of\nconsternation, all that might have corrected and restrained this\nimpression was effaced, and society, and the human race, and the\nuniverse were, henceforth, summed up in his eyes, in one simple and\nterrible feature,—thus the penal laws, the thing judged, the force due\nto legislation, the decrees of the sovereign courts, the magistracy,\nthe government, prevention, repression, official cruelty, wisdom, legal\ninfallibility, the principle of authority, all the dogmas on which rest\npolitical and civil security, sovereignty, justice, public truth, all\nthis was rubbish, a shapeless mass, chaos; he himself, Javert, the spy\nof order, incorruptibility in the service of the police, the bull-dog\nprovidence of society, vanquished and hurled to earth; and, erect, at\nthe summit of all that ruin, a man with a green cap on his head and a\nhalo round his brow; this was the astounding confusion to which he had\ncome; this was the fearful vision which he bore within his soul.\n\nWas this to be endured? No.\n\nA violent state, if ever such existed. There were only two ways of\nescaping from it. One was to go resolutely to Jean Valjean, and restore\nto his cell the convict from the galleys. The other....\n\nJavert quitted the parapet, and, with head erect this time, betook\nhimself, with a firm tread, towards the station-house indicated by a\nlantern at one of the corners of the Place du Châtelet.\n\nOn arriving there, he saw through the window a sergeant of police, and\nhe entered. Policemen recognize each other by the very way in which\nthey open the door of a station-house. Javert mentioned his name,\nshowed his card to the sergeant, and seated himself at the table of the\npost on which a candle was burning. On a table lay a pen, a leaden\ninkstand and paper, provided in the event of possible reports and the\norders of the night patrols. This table, still completed by its\nstraw-seated chair, is an institution; it exists in all police\nstations; it is invariably ornamented with a box-wood saucer filled\nwith sawdust and a wafer box of cardboard filled with red wafers, and\nit forms the lowest stage of official style. It is there that the\nliterature of the State has its beginning.\n\nJavert took a pen and a sheet of paper, and began to write. This is\nwhat he wrote:\n\nA FEW OBSERVATIONS FOR THE GOOD OF THE SERVICE.\n\n“In the first place:  I beg Monsieur le Préfet to cast his eyes on\nthis.\n\n“Secondly:  prisoners, on arriving after examination, take off their\nshoes and stand barefoot on the flagstones while they are being\nsearched.  Many of them cough on their return to prison. This entails\nhospital expenses.\n\n“Thirdly:  the mode of keeping track of a man with relays of police\nagents from distance to distance, is good, but, on important occasions,\nit is requisite that at least two agents should never lose sight of\neach other, so that, in case one agent should, for any cause, grow weak\nin his service, the other may supervise him and take his place.\n\n“Fourthly:  it is inexplicable why the special regulation of the prison\nof the Madelonettes interdicts the prisoner from having a chair, even\nby paying for it.\n\n“Fifthly:  in the Madelonettes there are only two bars to the canteen,\nso that the canteen woman can touch the prisoners with her hand.\n\n“Sixthly:  the prisoners called barkers, who summon the other prisoners\nto the parlor, force the prisoner to pay them two sous to call his name\ndistinctly.  This is a theft.\n\n“Seventhly:  for a broken thread ten sous are withheld in the weaving\nshop; this is an abuse of the contractor, since the cloth is none the\nworse for it.\n\n“Eighthly:  it is annoying for visitors to La Force to be obliged to\ntraverse the boys’ court in order to reach the parlor of\nSainte-Marie-l‘Égyptienne.\n\n“Ninthly:  it is a fact that any day gendarmes can be overheard\nrelating in the court-yard of the prefecture the interrogations put by\nthe magistrates to prisoners.  For a gendarme, who should be sworn to\nsecrecy, to repeat what he has heard in the examination room is a grave\ndisorder.\n\n“Tenthly:  Mme. Henry is an honest woman; her canteen is very neat; but\nit is bad to have a woman keep the wicket to the mouse-trap of the\nsecret cells.  This is unworthy of the Conciergerie of a great\ncivilization.”\n\n\nJavert wrote these lines in his calmest and most correct chirography,\nnot omitting a single comma, and making the paper screech under his\npen. Below the last line he signed:\n\n“JAVERT,\n\n“Inspector of the 1st class.\n\n“The Post of the Place du Châtelet.\n\n“June 7th, 1832, about one o’clock in the morning.”\n\n\n\nJavert dried the fresh ink on the paper, folded it like a letter,\nsealed it, wrote on the back: _Note for the administration_, left it on\nthe table, and quitted the post. The glazed and grated door fell to\nbehind him.\n\nAgain he traversed the Place du Châtelet diagonally, regained the quay,\nand returned with automatic precision to the very point which he had\nabandoned a quarter of an hour previously, leaned on his elbows and\nfound himself again in the same attitude on the same paving-stone of\nthe parapet. He did not appear to have stirred.\n\nThe darkness was complete. It was the sepulchral moment which follows\nmidnight. A ceiling of clouds concealed the stars. Not a single light\nburned in the houses of the city; no one was passing; all of the\nstreets and quays which could be seen were deserted; Notre-Dame and the\ntowers of the Court-House seemed features of the night. A street\nlantern reddened the margin of the quay. The outlines of the bridges\nlay shapeless in the mist one behind the other. Recent rains had\nswollen the river.\n\nThe spot where Javert was leaning was, it will be remembered, situated\nprecisely over the rapids of the Seine, perpendicularly above that\nformidable spiral of whirlpools which loose and knot themselves again\nlike an endless screw.\n\nJavert bent his head and gazed. All was black. Nothing was to be\ndistinguished. A sound of foam was audible; but the river could not be\nseen. At moments, in that dizzy depth, a gleam of light appeared, and\nundulated vaguely, water possessing the power of taking light, no one\nknows whence, and converting it into a snake. The light vanished, and\nall became indistinct once more. Immensity seemed thrown open there.\nWhat lay below was not water, it was a gulf. The wall of the quay,\nabrupt, confused, mingled with the vapors, instantly concealed from\nsight, produced the effect of an escarpment of the infinite. Nothing\nwas to be seen, but the hostile chill of the water and the stale odor\nof the wet stones could be felt. A fierce breath rose from this abyss.\nThe flood in the river, divined rather than perceived, the tragic\nwhispering of the waves, the melancholy vastness of the arches of the\nbridge, the imaginable fall into that gloomy void, into all that shadow\nwas full of horror.\n\nJavert remained motionless for several minutes, gazing at this opening\nof shadow; he considered the invisible with a fixity that resembled\nattention. The water roared. All at once he took off his hat and placed\nit on the edge of the quay. A moment later, a tall black figure, which\na belated passer-by in the distance might have taken for a phantom,\nappeared erect upon the parapet of the quay, bent over towards the\nSeine, then drew itself up again, and fell straight down into the\nshadows; a dull splash followed; and the shadow alone was in the secret\nof the convulsions of that obscure form which had disappeared beneath\nthe water.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTH—GRANDSON AND GRANDFATHER\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—IN WHICH THE TREE WITH THE ZINC PLASTER APPEARS AGAIN\n\n\nSome time after the events which we have just recorded, Sieur\nBoulatruelle experienced a lively emotion.\n\nSieur Boulatruelle was that road-mender of Montfermeil whom the reader\nhas already seen in the gloomy parts of this book.\n\nBoulatruelle, as the reader may, perchance, recall, was a man who was\noccupied with divers and troublesome matters. He broke stones and\ndamaged travellers on the highway.\n\nRoad-mender and thief as he was, he cherished one dream; he believed in\nthe treasures buried in the forest of Montfermeil. He hoped some day to\nfind the money in the earth at the foot of a tree; in the meanwhile, he\nlived to search the pockets of passers-by.\n\nNevertheless, for an instant, he was prudent. He had just escaped\nneatly. He had been, as the reader is aware, picked up in Jondrette’s\ngarret in company with the other ruffians. Utility of a vice: his\ndrunkenness had been his salvation. The authorities had never been able\nto make out whether he had been there in the quality of a robber or a\nman who had been robbed. An order of _nolle prosequi_, founded on his\nwell authenticated state of intoxication on the evening of the ambush,\nhad set him at liberty. He had taken to his heels. He had returned to\nhis road from Gagny to Lagny, to make, under administrative\nsupervision, broken stone for the good of the state, with downcast\nmien, in a very pensive mood, his ardor for theft somewhat cooled; but\nhe was addicted nonetheless tenderly to the wine which had recently\nsaved him.\n\nAs for the lively emotion which he had experienced a short time after\nhis return to his road-mender’s turf-thatched cot, here it is:\n\nOne morning, Boulatruelle, while on his way as was his wont, to his\nwork, and possibly also to his ambush, a little before daybreak caught\nsight, through the branches of the trees, of a man, whose back alone he\nsaw, but the shape of whose shoulders, as it seemed to him at that\ndistance and in the early dusk, was not entirely unfamiliar to him.\nBoulatruelle, although intoxicated, had a correct and lucid memory, a\ndefensive arm that is indispensable to any one who is at all in\nconflict with legal order.\n\n“Where the deuce have I seen something like that man yonder?” he said\nto himself. But he could make himself no answer, except that the man\nresembled some one of whom his memory preserved a confused trace.\n\nHowever, apart from the identity which he could not manage to catch,\nBoulatruelle put things together and made calculations. This man did\nnot belong in the country-side. He had just arrived there. On foot,\nevidently. No public conveyance passes through Montfermeil at that\nhour. He had walked all night. Whence came he? Not from a very great\ndistance; for he had neither haversack, nor bundle. From Paris, no\ndoubt. Why was he in these woods? why was he there at such an hour?\nwhat had he come there for?\n\nBoulatruelle thought of the treasure. By dint of ransacking his memory,\nhe recalled in a vague way that he had already, many years before, had\na similar alarm in connection with a man who produced on him the effect\nthat he might well be this very individual.\n\n“By the deuce,” said Boulatruelle, “I’ll find him again. I’ll discover\nthe parish of that parishioner. This prowler of Patron-Minette has a\nreason, and I’ll know it. People can’t have secrets in my forest if I\ndon’t have a finger in the pie.”\n\n\nHe took his pick-axe which was very sharply pointed.\n\n“There now,” he grumbled, “is something that will search the earth and\na man.”\n\n\nAnd, as one knots one thread to another thread, he took up the line of\nmarch at his best pace in the direction which the man must follow, and\nset out across the thickets.\n\nWhen he had compassed a hundred strides, the day, which was already\nbeginning to break, came to his assistance. Footprints stamped in the\nsand, weeds trodden down here and there, heather crushed, young\nbranches in the brushwood bent and in the act of straightening\nthemselves up again with the graceful deliberation of the arms of a\npretty woman who stretches herself when she wakes, pointed out to him a\nsort of track. He followed it, then lost it. Time was flying. He\nplunged deeper into the woods and came to a sort of eminence. An early\nhuntsman who was passing in the distance along a path, whistling the\nair of Guillery, suggested to him the idea of climbing a tree. Old as\nhe was, he was agile. There stood close at hand a beech-tree of great\nsize, worthy of Tityrus and of Boulatruelle. Boulatruelle ascended the\nbeech as high as he was able.\n\nThe idea was a good one. On scrutinizing the solitary waste on the side\nwhere the forest is thoroughly entangled and wild, Boulatruelle\nsuddenly caught sight of his man.\n\nHardly had he got his eye upon him when he lost sight of him.\n\nThe man entered, or rather, glided into, an open glade, at a\nconsiderable distance, masked by large trees, but with which\nBoulatruelle was perfectly familiar, on account of having noticed, near\na large pile of porous stones, an ailing chestnut-tree bandaged with a\nsheet of zinc nailed directly upon the bark. This glade was the one\nwhich was formerly called the Blaru-bottom. The heap of stones,\ndestined for no one knows what employment, which was visible there\nthirty years ago, is doubtless still there. Nothing equals a heap of\nstones in longevity, unless it is a board fence. They are temporary\nexpedients. What a reason for lasting!\n\nBoulatruelle, with the rapidity of joy, dropped rather than descended\nfrom the tree. The lair was unearthed, the question now was to seize\nthe beast. That famous treasure of his dreams was probably there.\n\nIt was no small matter to reach that glade. By the beaten paths, which\nindulge in a thousand teasing zigzags, it required a good quarter of an\nhour. In a bee-line, through the underbrush, which is peculiarly dense,\nvery thorny, and very aggressive in that locality, a full half hour was\nnecessary. Boulatruelle committed the error of not comprehending this.\nHe believed in the straight line; a respectable optical illusion which\nruins many a man. The thicket, bristling as it was, struck him as the\nbest road.\n\n“Let’s take to the wolves’ Rue de Rivoli,” said he.\n\nBoulatruelle, accustomed to taking crooked courses, was on this\noccasion guilty of the fault of going straight.\n\nHe flung himself resolutely into the tangle of undergrowth.\n\nHe had to deal with holly bushes, nettles, hawthorns, eglantines,\nthistles, and very irascible brambles. He was much lacerated.\n\nAt the bottom of the ravine he found water which he was obliged to\ntraverse.\n\nAt last he reached the Blaru-bottom, after the lapse of forty minutes,\nsweating, soaked, breathless, scratched, and ferocious.\n\nThere was no one in the glade. Boulatruelle rushed to the heap of\nstones. It was in its place. It had not been carried off.\n\nAs for the man, he had vanished in the forest. He had made his escape.\nWhere? in what direction? into what thicket? Impossible to guess.\n\nAnd, heartrending to say, there, behind the pile of stones, in front of\nthe tree with the sheet of zinc, was freshly turned earth, a pick-axe,\nabandoned or forgotten, and a hole.\n\nThe hole was empty.\n\n“Thief!” shrieked Boulatruelle, shaking his fist at the horizon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—MARIUS, EMERGING FROM CIVIL WAR, MAKES READY FOR DOMESTIC\nWAR\n\n\nFor a long time, Marius was neither dead nor alive. For many weeks he\nlay in a fever accompanied by delirium, and by tolerably grave cerebral\nsymptoms, caused more by the shocks of the wounds on the head than by\nthe wounds themselves.\n\nHe repeated Cosette’s name for whole nights in the melancholy loquacity\nof fever, and with the sombre obstinacy of agony. The extent of some of\nthe lesions presented a serious danger, the suppuration of large wounds\nbeing always liable to become re-absorbed, and consequently, to kill\nthe sick man, under certain atmospheric conditions; at every change of\nweather, at the slightest storm, the physician was uneasy.\n\n“Above all things,” he repeated, “let the wounded man be subjected to\nno emotion.” The dressing of the wounds was complicated and difficult,\nthe fixation of apparatus and bandages by cerecloths not having been\ninvented as yet, at that epoch. Nicolette used up a sheet “as big as\nthe ceiling,” as she put it, for lint. It was not without difficulty\nthat the chloruretted lotions and the nitrate of silver overcame the\ngangrene. As long as there was any danger, M. Gillenormand, seated in\ndespair at his grandson’s pillow, was, like Marius, neither alive nor\ndead.\n\nEvery day, sometimes twice a day, a very well dressed gentleman with\nwhite hair,—such was the description given by the porter,—came to\ninquire about the wounded man, and left a large package of lint for the\ndressings.\n\nFinally, on the 7th of September, four months to a day, after the\nsorrowful night when he had been brought back to his grandfather in a\ndying condition, the doctor declared that he would answer for Marius.\nConvalescence began. But Marius was forced to remain for two months\nmore stretched out on a long chair, on account of the results called up\nby the fracture of his collar-bone. There always is a last wound like\nthat which will not close, and which prolongs the dressings\nindefinitely, to the great annoyance of the sick person.\n\nHowever, this long illness and this long convalescence saved him from\nall pursuit. In France, there is no wrath, not even of a public\ncharacter, which six months will not extinguish. Revolts, in the\npresent state of society, are so much the fault of every one, that they\nare followed by a certain necessity of shutting the eyes.\n\nLet us add, that the inexcusable Gisquet order, which enjoined doctors\nto lodge information against the wounded, having outraged public\nopinion, and not opinion alone, but the King first of all, the wounded\nwere covered and protected by this indignation; and, with the exception\nof those who had been made prisoners in the very act of combat, the\ncouncils of war did not dare to trouble any one. So Marius was left in\npeace.\n\nM. Gillenormand first passed through all manner of anguish, and then\nthrough every form of ecstasy. It was found difficult to prevent his\npassing every night beside the wounded man; he had his big armchair\ncarried to Marius’ bedside; he required his daughter to take the finest\nlinen in the house for compresses and bandages. Mademoiselle\nGillenormand, like a sage and elderly person, contrived to spare the\nfine linen, while allowing the grandfather to think that he was obeyed.\nM. Gillenormand would not permit any one to explain to him, that for\nthe preparation of lint batiste is not nearly so good as coarse linen,\nnor new linen as old linen. He was present at all the dressings of the\nwounds from which Mademoiselle Gillenormand modestly absented herself.\nWhen the dead flesh was cut away with scissors, he said: “Aïe! aïe!”\nNothing was more touching than to see him with his gentle, senile\npalsy, offer the wounded man a cup of his cooling-draught. He\noverwhelmed the doctor with questions. He did not observe that he asked\nthe same ones over and over again.\n\nOn the day when the doctor announced to him that Marius was out of\ndanger, the good man was in a delirium. He made his porter a present of\nthree louis. That evening, on his return to his own chamber, he danced\na gavotte, using his thumb and forefinger as castanets, and he sang the\nfollowing song:\n\n“Jeanne est née à Fougère     “Amour, tu vis en elle;\nVrai nid d’une bergère;       Car c’est dans sa prunelle\nJ’adore son jupon,            Que tu mets ton carquois.\nFripon.                       Narquois!\n\n“Moi, je la chante, et j’aime,\nPlus que Diane même,\nJeanne et ses durs tetons\nBretons.\"61\n\n\nThen he knelt upon a chair, and Basque, who was watching him through\nthe half-open door, made sure that he was praying.\n\nUp to that time, he had not believed in God.\n\nAt each succeeding phase of improvement, which became more and more\npronounced, the grandfather raved. He executed a multitude of\nmechanical actions full of joy; he ascended and descended the stairs,\nwithout knowing why. A pretty female neighbor was amazed one morning at\nreceiving a big bouquet; it was M. Gillenormand who had sent it to her.\nThe husband made a jealous scene. M. Gillenormand tried to draw\nNicolette upon his knees. He called Marius, “M. le Baron.” He shouted:\n“Long live the Republic!”\n\n\nEvery moment, he kept asking the doctor: “Is he no longer in danger?”\nHe gazed upon Marius with the eyes of a grandmother. He brooded over\nhim while he ate. He no longer knew himself, he no longer rendered\nhimself an account of himself. Marius was the master of the house,\nthere was abdication in his joy, he was the grandson of his grandson.\n\nIn the state of joy in which he then was, he was the most venerable of\nchildren. In his fear lest he might fatigue or annoy the convalescent,\nhe stepped behind him to smile. He was content, joyous, delighted,\ncharming, young. His white locks added a gentle majesty to the gay\nradiance of his visage. When grace is mingled with wrinkles, it is\nadorable. There is an indescribable aurora in beaming old age.\n\nAs for Marius, as he allowed them to dress his wounds and care for him,\nhe had but one fixed idea: Cosette.\n\nAfter the fever and delirium had left him, he did not again pronounce\nher name, and it might have been supposed that he no longer thought of\nher. He held his peace, precisely because his soul was there.\n\nHe did not know what had become of Cosette; the whole affair of the Rue\nde la Chanvrerie was like a cloud in his memory; shadows that were\nalmost indistinct, floated through his mind, Éponine, Gavroche, Mabeuf,\nthe Thénardiers, all his friends gloomily intermingled with the smoke\nof the barricade; the strange passage of M. Fauchelevent through that\nadventure produced on him the effect of a puzzle in a tempest; he\nunderstood nothing connected with his own life, he did not know how nor\nby whom he had been saved, and no one of those around him knew this;\nall that they had been able to tell him was, that he had been brought\nhome at night in a hackney-coach, to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire;\npast, present, future were nothing more to him than the mist of a vague\nidea; but in that fog there was one immovable point, one clear and\nprecise outline, something made of granite, a resolution, a will; to\nfind Cosette once more. For him, the idea of life was not distinct from\nthe idea of Cosette. He had decreed in his heart that he would not\naccept the one without the other, and he was immovably resolved to\nexact of any person whatever, who should desire to force him to\nlive,—from his grandfather, from fate, from hell,—the restitution of\nhis vanished Eden.\n\nHe did not conceal from himself the fact that obstacles existed.\n\nLet us here emphasize one detail, he was not won over and was but\nlittle softened by all the solicitude and tenderness of his\ngrandfather. In the first place, he was not in the secret; then, in his\nreveries of an invalid, which were still feverish, possibly, he\ndistrusted this tenderness as a strange and novel thing, which had for\nits object his conquest. He remained cold. The grandfather absolutely\nwasted his poor old smile. Marius said to himself that it was all right\nso long as he, Marius, did not speak, and let things take their course;\nbut that when it became a question of Cosette, he would find another\nface, and that his grandfather’s true attitude would be unmasked. Then\nthere would be an unpleasant scene; a recrudescence of family\nquestions, a confrontation of positions, every sort of sarcasm and all\nmanner of objections at one and the same time, Fauchelevent,\nCoupelevent, fortune, poverty, a stone about his neck, the future.\nViolent resistance; conclusion: a refusal. Marius stiffened himself in\nadvance.\n\nAnd then, in proportion as he regained life, the old ulcers of his\nmemory opened once more, he reflected again on the past, Colonel\nPontmercy placed himself once more between M. Gillenormand and him,\nMarius, he told himself that he had no true kindness to expect from a\nperson who had been so unjust and so hard to his father. And with\nhealth, there returned to him a sort of harshness towards his\ngrandfather. The old man was gently pained by this. M. Gillenormand,\nwithout however allowing it to appear, observed that Marius, ever since\nthe latter had been brought back to him and had regained consciousness,\nhad not once called him father. It is true that he did not say\n“monsieur” to him; but he contrived not to say either the one or the\nother, by means of a certain way of turning his phrases. Obviously, a\ncrisis was approaching.\n\nAs almost always happens in such cases, Marius skirmished before giving\nbattle, by way of proving himself. This is called “feeling the ground.”\nOne morning it came to pass that M. Gillenormand spoke slightingly of\nthe Convention, apropos of a newspaper which had fallen into his hands,\nand gave vent to a Royalist harangue on Danton, Saint-Juste and\nRobespierre.—“The men of ’93 were giants,” said Marius with severity.\nThe old man held his peace, and uttered not a sound during the\nremainder of that day.\n\nMarius, who had always present to his mind the inflexible grandfather\nof his early years, interpreted this silence as a profound\nconcentration of wrath, augured from it a hot conflict, and augmented\nhis preparations for the fray in the inmost recesses of his mind.\n\nHe decided that, in case of a refusal, he would tear off his bandages,\ndislocate his collar-bone, that he would lay bare all the wounds which\nhe had left, and would reject all food. His wounds were his munitions\nof war. He would have Cosette or die.\n\nHe awaited the propitious moment with the crafty patience of the sick.\n\nThat moment arrived.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—MARIUS ATTACKED\n\n\nOne day, M. Gillenormand, while his daughter was putting in order the\nphials and cups on the marble of the commode, bent over Marius and said\nto him in his tenderest accents: “Look here, my little Marius, if I\nwere in your place, I would eat meat now in preference to fish. A fried\nsole is excellent to begin a convalescence with, but a good cutlet is\nneeded to put a sick man on his feet.”\n\n\nMarius, who had almost entirely recovered his strength, collected the\nwhole of it, drew himself up into a sitting posture, laid his two\nclenched fists on the sheets of his bed, looked his grandfather in the\nface, assumed a terrible air, and said:\n\n“This leads me to say something to you.”\n\n\n“What is it?”\n\n\n“That I wish to marry.”\n\n\n“Agreed,” said his grandfather.—And he burst out laughing.\n\n“How agreed?”\n\n\n“Yes, agreed. You shall have your little girl.”\n\n\nMarius, stunned and overwhelmed with the dazzling shock, trembled in\nevery limb.\n\nM. Gillenormand went on:\n\n“Yes, you shall have her, that pretty little girl of yours. She comes\nevery day in the shape of an old gentleman to inquire after you. Ever\nsince you were wounded, she has passed her time in weeping and making\nlint. I have made inquiries. She lives in the Rue de l’Homme Armé, No.\n7. Ah! There we have it! Ah! so you want her! Well, you shall have her.\nYou’re caught. You had arranged your little plot, you had said to\nyourself:—‘I’m going to signify this squarely to my grandfather, to\nthat mummy of the Regency and of the Directory, to that ancient beau,\nto that Dorante turned Géronte; he has indulged in his frivolities\nalso, that he has, and he has had his love affairs, and his grisettes\nand his Cosettes; he has made his rustle, he has had his wings, he has\neaten of the bread of spring; he certainly must remember it.’ Ah! you\ntake the cockchafer by the horns. That’s good. I offer you a cutlet and\nyou answer me: ‘By the way, I want to marry.’ There’s a transition for\nyou! Ah! you reckoned on a bickering! You do not know that I am an old\ncoward. What do you say to that? You are vexed? You did not expect to\nfind your grandfather still more foolish than yourself, you are wasting\nthe discourse which you meant to bestow upon me, Mr. Lawyer, and that’s\nvexatious. Well, so much the worse, rage away. I’ll do whatever you\nwish, and that cuts you short, imbecile! Listen. I have made my\ninquiries, I’m cunning too; she is charming, she is discreet, it is not\ntrue about the lancer, she has made heaps of lint, she’s a jewel, she\nadores you, if you had died, there would have been three of us, her\ncoffin would have accompanied mine. I have had an idea, ever since you\nhave been better, of simply planting her at your bedside, but it is\nonly in romances that young girls are brought to the bedsides of\nhandsome young wounded men who interest them. It is not done. What\nwould your aunt have said to it? You were nude three quarters of the\ntime, my good fellow. Ask Nicolette, who has not left you for a moment,\nif there was any possibility of having a woman here. And then, what\nwould the doctor have said? A pretty girl does not cure a man of fever.\nIn short, it’s all right, let us say no more about it, all’s said,\nall’s done, it’s all settled, take her. Such is my ferocity. You see, I\nperceived that you did not love me. I said to myself: ‘Here now, I have\nmy little Cosette right under my hand, I’m going to give her to him, he\nwill be obliged to love me a little then, or he must tell the reason\nwhy.’ Ah! so you thought that the old man was going to storm, to put on\na big voice, to shout no, and to lift his cane at all that aurora. Not\na bit of it. Cosette, so be it; love, so be it; I ask nothing better.\nPray take the trouble of getting married, sir. Be happy, my\nwell-beloved child.”\n\n\nThat said, the old man burst forth into sobs.\n\nAnd he seized Marius’ head, and pressed it with both arms against his\nbreast, and both fell to weeping. This is one of the forms of supreme\nhappiness.\n\n“Father!” cried Marius.\n\n“Ah, so you love me!” said the old man.\n\nAn ineffable moment ensued. They were choking and could not speak.\n\nAt length the old man stammered:\n\n“Come! his mouth is unstopped at last. He has said: ‘Father’ to me.”\n\n\nMarius disengaged his head from his grandfather’s arms, and said\ngently:\n\n“But, father, now that I am quite well, it seems to me that I might see\nher.”\n\n\n“Agreed again, you shall see her to-morrow.”\n\n\n“Father!”\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“Why not to-day?”\n\n\n“Well, to-day then. Let it be to-day. You have called me ‘father’ three\ntimes, and it is worth it. I will attend to it. She shall be brought\nhither. Agreed, I tell you. It has already been put into verse. This is\nthe ending of the elegy of the ‘Jeune Malade’ by André Chénier, by\nAndré Chénier whose throat was cut by the ras . . . by the giants of\n’93.”\n\n\nM. Gillenormand fancied that he detected a faint frown on the part of\nMarius, who, in truth, as we must admit, was no longer listening to\nhim, and who was thinking far more of Cosette than of 1793.\n\nThe grandfather, trembling at having so inopportunely introduced André\nChénier, resumed precipitately:\n\n“Cut his throat is not the word. The fact is that the great\nrevolutionary geniuses, who were not malicious, that is incontestable,\nwho were heroes, pardi! found that André Chénier embarrassed them\nsomewhat, and they had him guillot . . . that is to say, those great\nmen on the 7th of Thermidor, besought André Chénier, in the interests\nof public safety, to be so good as to go....”\n\n\nM. Gillenormand, clutched by the throat by his own phrase, could not\nproceed. Being able neither to finish it nor to retract it, while his\ndaughter arranged the pillow behind Marius, who was overwhelmed with so\nmany emotions, the old man rushed headlong, with as much rapidity as\nhis age permitted, from the bed-chamber, shut the door behind him, and,\npurple, choking and foaming at the mouth, his eyes starting from his\nhead, he found himself nose to nose with honest Basque, who was\nblacking boots in the anteroom. He seized Basque by the collar, and\nshouted full in his face in fury:—“By the hundred thousand Javottes of\nthe devil, those ruffians did assassinate him!”\n\n\n“Who, sir?”\n\n\n“André Chénier!”\n\n\n“Yes, sir,” said Basque in alarm.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND ENDS BY NO LONGER THINKING IT A\nBAD THING THAT M. FAUCHELEVENT SHOULD HAVE ENTERED WITH SOMETHING UNDER\nHIS ARM\n\n\nCosette and Marius beheld each other once more.\n\nWhat that interview was like we decline to say. There are things which\none must not attempt to depict; the sun is one of them.\n\nThe entire family, including Basque and Nicolette, were assembled in\nMarius’ chamber at the moment when Cosette entered it.\n\nPrecisely at that moment, the grandfather was on the point of blowing\nhis nose; he stopped short, holding his nose in his handkerchief, and\ngazing over it at Cosette.\n\nShe appeared on the threshold; it seemed to him that she was surrounded\nby a glory.\n\n“Adorable!” he exclaimed.\n\nThen he blew his nose noisily.\n\nCosette was intoxicated, delighted, frightened, in heaven. She was as\nthoroughly alarmed as any one can be by happiness. She stammered all\npale, yet flushed, she wanted to fling herself into Marius’ arms, and\ndared not. Ashamed of loving in the presence of all these people.\nPeople are pitiless towards happy lovers; they remain when the latter\nmost desire to be left alone. Lovers have no need of any people\nwhatever.\n\nWith Cosette, and behind her, there had entered a man with white hair\nwho was grave yet smiling, though with a vague and heartrending smile.\nIt was “Monsieur Fauchelevent”; it was Jean Valjean.\n\nHe was very well dressed, as the porter had said, entirely in black, in\nperfectly new garments, and with a white cravat.\n\nThe porter was a thousand leagues from recognizing in this correct\nbourgeois, in this probable notary, the fear-inspiring bearer of the\ncorpse, who had sprung up at his door on the night of the 7th of June,\ntattered, muddy, hideous, haggard, his face masked in blood and mire,\nsupporting in his arms the fainting Marius; still, his porter’s scent\nwas aroused. When M. Fauchelevent arrived with Cosette, the porter had\nnot been able to refrain from communicating to his wife this aside: “I\ndon’t know why it is, but I can’t help fancying that I’ve seen that\nface before.”\n\n\nM. Fauchelevent in Marius’ chamber, remained apart near the door. He\nhad under his arm, a package which bore considerable resemblance to an\noctavo volume enveloped in paper. The enveloping paper was of a\ngreenish hue, and appeared to be mouldy.\n\n“Does the gentleman always have books like that under his arm?”\nMademoiselle Gillenormand, who did not like books, demanded in a low\ntone of Nicolette.\n\n“Well,” retorted M. Gillenormand, who had overheard her, in the same\ntone, “he’s a learned man. What then? Is that his fault? Monsieur\nBoulard, one of my acquaintances, never walked out without a book under\nhis arm either, and he always had some old volume hugged to his heart\nlike that.”\n\n\nAnd, with a bow, he said aloud:\n\n“Monsieur Tranchelevent....”\n\n\nFather Gillenormand did not do it intentionally, but inattention to\nproper names was an aristocratic habit of his.\n\n“Monsieur Tranchelevent, I have the honor of asking you, on behalf of\nmy grandson, Baron Marius Pontmercy, for the hand of Mademoiselle.”\n\n\nMonsieur Tranchelevent bowed.\n\n“That’s settled,” said the grandfather.\n\nAnd, turning to Marius and Cosette, with both arms extended in\nblessing, he cried:\n\n“Permission to adore each other!”\n\n\nThey did not require him to repeat it twice. So much the worse! the\nchirping began. They talked low. Marius, resting on his elbow on his\nreclining chair, Cosette standing beside him. “Oh, heavens!” murmured\nCosette, “I see you once again! it is thou! it is you! The idea of\ngoing and fighting like that! But why? It is horrible. I have been dead\nfor four months. Oh! how wicked it was of you to go to that battle!\nWhat had I done to you? I pardon you, but you will never do it again. A\nlittle while ago, when they came to tell us to come to you, I still\nthought that I was about to die, but it was from joy. I was so sad! I\nhave not taken the time to dress myself, I must frighten people with my\nlooks! What will your relatives say to see me in a crumpled collar? Do\nspeak! You let me do all the talking. We are still in the Rue de\nl’Homme Armé. It seems that your shoulder was terrible. They told me\nthat you could put your fist in it. And then, it seems that they cut\nyour flesh with the scissors. That is frightful. I have cried till I\nhave no eyes left. It is queer that a person can suffer like that. Your\ngrandfather has a very kindly air. Don’t disturb yourself, don’t rise\non your elbow, you will injure yourself. Oh! how happy I am! So our\nunhappiness is over! I am quite foolish. I had things to say to you,\nand I no longer know in the least what they were. Do you still love me?\nWe live in the Rue de l’Homme Armé. There is no garden. I made lint all\nthe time; stay, sir, look, it is your fault, I have a callous on my\nfingers.”\n\n\n“Angel!” said Marius.\n\n_Angel_ is the only word in the language which cannot be worn out. No\nother word could resist the merciless use which lovers make of it.\n\nThen as there were spectators, they paused and said not a word more,\ncontenting themselves with softly touching each other’s hands.\n\nM. Gillenormand turned towards those who were in the room and cried:\n\n“Talk loud, the rest of you. Make a noise, you people behind the\nscenes. Come, a little uproar, the deuce! so that the children can\nchatter at their ease.”\n\n\nAnd, approaching Marius and Cosette, he said to them in a very low\nvoice:\n\n“Call each other _thou_. Don’t stand on ceremony.”\n\n\nAunt Gillenormand looked on in amazement at this irruption of light in\nher elderly household. There was nothing aggressive about this\namazement; it was not the least in the world like the scandalized and\nenvious glance of an owl at two turtledoves, it was the stupid eye of a\npoor innocent seven and fifty years of age; it was a life which had\nbeen a failure gazing at that triumph, love.\n\n“Mademoiselle Gillenormand senior,” said her father to her, “I told you\nthat this is what would happen to you.”\n\n\nHe remained silent for a moment, and then added:\n\n“Look at the happiness of others.”\n\n\nThen he turned to Cosette.\n\n“How pretty she is! how pretty she is! She’s a Greuze. So you are going\nto have that all to yourself, you scamp! Ah! my rogue, you are getting\noff nicely with me, you are happy; if I were not fifteen years too old,\nwe would fight with swords to see which of us should have her. Come\nnow! I am in love with you, mademoiselle. It’s perfectly simple. It is\nyour right. You are in the right. Ah! what a sweet, charming little\nwedding this will make! Our parish is Saint-Denis du Saint Sacrament,\nbut I will get a dispensation so that you can be married at Saint-Paul.\nThe church is better. It was built by the Jesuits. It is more\ncoquettish. It is opposite the fountain of Cardinal de Birague. The\nmasterpiece of Jesuit architecture is at Namur. It is called\nSaint-Loup. You must go there after you are married. It is worth the\njourney. Mademoiselle, I am quite of your mind, I think girls ought to\nmarry; that is what they are made for. There is a certain\nSainte-Catherine whom I should always like to see uncoiffed.62 It’s a\nfine thing to remain a spinster, but it is chilly. The Bible says:\nMultiply. In order to save the people, Jeanne d’Arc is needed; but in\norder to make people, what is needed is Mother Goose. So, marry, my\nbeauties. I really do not see the use in remaining a spinster! I know\nthat they have their chapel apart in the church, and that they fall\nback on the Society of the Virgin; but, sapristi, a handsome husband, a\nfine fellow, and at the expiration of a year, a big, blond brat who\nnurses lustily, and who has fine rolls of fat on his thighs, and who\nmusses up your breast in handfuls with his little rosy paws, laughing\nthe while like the dawn,—that’s better than holding a candle at\nvespers, and chanting _Turris Eburnea!_”\n\n\nThe grandfather executed a pirouette on his eighty-year-old heels, and\nbegan to talk again like a spring that has broken loose once more:\n\n“Ainsi, bornant les cours de tes rêvasseries,\nAlcippe, il est donc vrai, dans peu tu te maries.\"63\n\n\n“By the way!”\n\n\n“What is it, father?”\n\n\n“Have not you an intimate friend?”\n\n\n“Yes, Courfeyrac.”\n\n\n“What has become of him?”\n\n\n“He is dead.”\n\n\n“That is good.”\n\n\nHe seated himself near them, made Cosette sit down, and took their four\nhands in his aged and wrinkled hands:\n\n“She is exquisite, this darling. She’s a masterpiece, this Cosette! She\nis a very little girl and a very great lady. She will only be a\nBaroness, which is a come down for her; she was born a Marquise. What\neyelashes she has! Get it well fixed in your noddles, my children, that\nyou are in the true road. Love each other. Be foolish about it. Love is\nthe folly of men and the wit of God. Adore each other. Only,” he added,\nsuddenly becoming gloomy, “what a misfortune! It has just occurred to\nme! More than half of what I possess is swallowed up in an annuity; so\nlong as I live, it will not matter, but after my death, a score of\nyears hence, ah! my poor children, you will not have a sou! Your\nbeautiful white hands, Madame la Baronne, will do the devil the honor\nof pulling him by the tail.\"64\n\nAt this point they heard a grave and tranquil voice say:\n\n“Mademoiselle Euphrasie Fauchelevent possesses six hundred thousand\nfrancs.”\n\n\nIt was the voice of Jean Valjean.\n\nSo far he had not uttered a single word, no one seemed to be aware that\nhe was there, and he had remained standing erect and motionless, behind\nall these happy people.\n\n“What has Mademoiselle Euphrasie to do with the question?” inquired the\nstartled grandfather.\n\n“I am she,” replied Cosette.\n\n“Six hundred thousand francs?” resumed M. Gillenormand.\n\n“Minus fourteen or fifteen thousand francs, possibly,” said Jean\nValjean.\n\nAnd he laid on the table the package which Mademoiselle Gillenormand\nhad mistaken for a book.\n\nJean Valjean himself opened the package; it was a bundle of bank-notes.\nThey were turned over and counted. There were five hundred notes for a\nthousand francs each, and one hundred and sixty-eight of five hundred.\nIn all, five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs.\n\n“This is a fine book,” said M. Gillenormand.\n\n“Five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs!” murmured the aunt.\n\n“This arranges things well, does it not, Mademoiselle Gillenormand\nsenior?” said the grandfather. “That devil of a Marius has ferreted out\nthe nest of a millionaire grisette in his tree of dreams! Just trust to\nthe love affairs of young folks now, will you! Students find\nstudentesses with six hundred thousand francs. Cherubino works better\nthan Rothschild.”\n\n\n“Five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs!” repeated Mademoiselle\nGillenormand, in a low tone. “Five hundred and eighty-four! one might\nas well say six hundred thousand!”\n\n\nAs for Marius and Cosette, they were gazing at each other while this\nwas going on; they hardly heeded this detail.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—DEPOSIT YOUR MONEY IN A FOREST RATHER THAN WITH A NOTARY\n\n\nThe reader has, no doubt, understood, without necessitating a lengthy\nexplanation, that Jean Valjean, after the Champmathieu affair, had been\nable, thanks to his first escape of a few days’ duration, to come to\nParis and to withdraw in season, from the hands of Laffitte, the sum\nearned by him, under the name of Monsieur Madeleine, at\nMontreuil-sur-Mer; and that fearing that he might be recaptured,—which\neventually happened—he had buried and hidden that sum in the forest of\nMontfermeil, in the locality known as the Blaru-bottom. The sum, six\nhundred and thirty thousand francs, all in bank-bills, was not very\nbulky, and was contained in a box; only, in order to preserve the box\nfrom dampness, he had placed it in a coffer filled with chestnut\nshavings. In the same coffer he had placed his other treasures, the\nBishop’s candlesticks. It will be remembered that he had carried off\nthe candlesticks when he made his escape from Montreuil-sur-Mer. The\nman seen one evening for the first time by Boulatruelle, was Jean\nValjean. Later on, every time that Jean Valjean needed money, he went\nto get it in the Blaru-bottom. Hence the absences which we have\nmentioned. He had a pickaxe somewhere in the heather, in a hiding-place\nknown to himself alone. When he beheld Marius convalescent, feeling\nthat the hour was at hand, when that money might prove of service, he\nhad gone to get it; it was he again, whom Boulatruelle had seen in the\nwoods, but on this occasion, in the morning instead of in the evening.\nBoulatreulle inherited his pickaxe.\n\nThe actual sum was five hundred and eighty-four thousand, five hundred\nfrancs. Jean Valjean withdrew the five hundred francs for himself.—“We\nshall see hereafter,” he thought.\n\nThe difference between that sum and the six hundred and thirty thousand\nfrancs withdrawn from Laffitte represented his expenditure in ten\nyears, from 1823 to 1833. The five years of his stay in the convent had\ncost only five thousand francs.\n\nJean Valjean set the two candlesticks on the chimney-piece, where they\nglittered to the great admiration of Toussaint.\n\nMoreover, Jean Valjean knew that he was delivered from Javert. The\nstory had been told in his presence, and he had verified the fact in\nthe _Moniteur_, how a police inspector named Javert had been found\ndrowned under a boat belonging to some laundresses, between the Pont au\nChange and the Pont-Neuf, and that a writing left by this man,\notherwise irreproachable and highly esteemed by his superiors, pointed\nto a fit of mental aberration and a suicide.—“In fact,” thought Jean\nValjean, “since he left me at liberty, once having got me in his power,\nhe must have been already mad.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—THE TWO OLD MEN DO EVERYTHING, EACH ONE AFTER HIS OWN\nFASHION, TO RENDER COSETTE HAPPY\n\n\nEverything was made ready for the wedding. The doctor, on being\nconsulted, declared that it might take place in February. It was then\nDecember. A few ravishing weeks of perfect happiness passed.\n\nThe grandfather was not the least happy of them all. He remained for a\nquarter of an hour at a time gazing at Cosette.\n\n“The wonderful, beautiful girl!” he exclaimed. “And she has so sweet\nand good an air! she is, without exception, the most charming girl that\nI have ever seen in my life. Later on, she’ll have virtues with an odor\nof violets. How graceful! one cannot live otherwise than nobly with\nsuch a creature. Marius, my boy, you are a Baron, you are rich, don’t\ngo to pettifogging, I beg of you.”\n\n\nCosette and Marius had passed abruptly from the sepulchre to paradise.\nThe transition had not been softened, and they would have been stunned,\nhad they not been dazzled by it.\n\n“Do you understand anything about it?” said Marius to Cosette.\n\n“No,” replied Cosette, “but it seems to me that the good God is caring\nfor us.”\n\n\nJean Valjean did everything, smoothed away every difficulty, arranged\neverything, made everything easy. He hastened towards Cosette’s\nhappiness with as much ardor, and, apparently with as much joy, as\nCosette herself.\n\nAs he had been a mayor, he understood how to solve that delicate\nproblem, with the secret of which he alone was acquainted, Cosette’s\ncivil status. If he were to announce her origin bluntly, it might\nprevent the marriage, who knows? He extricated Cosette from all\ndifficulties. He concocted for her a family of dead people, a sure\nmeans of not encountering any objections. Cosette was the only scion of\nan extinct family; Cosette was not his own daughter, but the daughter\nof the other Fauchelevent. Two brothers Fauchelevent had been gardeners\nto the convent of the Petit-Picpus. Inquiry was made at that convent;\nthe very best information and the most respectable references abounded;\nthe good nuns, not very apt and but little inclined to fathom questions\nof paternity, and not attaching any importance to the matter, had never\nunderstood exactly of which of the two Fauchelevents Cosette was the\ndaughter. They said what was wanted and they said it with zeal. An\n_acte de notoriété_ was drawn up. Cosette became in the eyes of the\nlaw, Mademoiselle Euphrasie Fauchelevent. She was declared an orphan,\nboth father and mother being dead. Jean Valjean so arranged it that he\nwas appointed, under the name of Fauchelevent, as Cosette’s guardian,\nwith M. Gillenormand as supervising guardian over him.\n\nAs for the five hundred and eighty thousand francs, they constituted a\nlegacy bequeathed to Cosette by a dead person, who desired to remain\nunknown. The original legacy had consisted of five hundred and\nninety-four thousand francs; but ten thousand francs had been expended\non the education of Mademoiselle Euphrasie, five thousand francs of\nthat amount having been paid to the convent. This legacy, deposited in\nthe hands of a third party, was to be turned over to Cosette at her\nmajority, or at the date of her marriage. This, taken as a whole, was\nvery acceptable, as the reader will perceive, especially when the sum\ndue was half a million. There were some peculiarities here and there,\nit is true, but they were not noticed; one of the interested parties\nhad his eyes blindfolded by love, the others by the six hundred\nthousand francs.\n\nCosette learned that she was not the daughter of that old man whom she\nhad so long called father. He was merely a kinsman; another\nFauchelevent was her real father. At any other time this would have\nbroken her heart. But at the ineffable moment which she was then\npassing through, it cast but a slight shadow, a faint cloud, and she\nwas so full of joy that the cloud did not last long. She had Marius.\nThe young man arrived, the old man was effaced; such is life.\n\nAnd then, Cosette had, for long years, been habituated to seeing\nenigmas around her; every being who has had a mysterious childhood is\nalways prepared for certain renunciations.\n\nNevertheless, she continued to call Jean Valjean: Father.\n\nCosette, happy as the angels, was enthusiastic over Father\nGillenormand. It is true that he overwhelmed her with gallant\ncompliments and presents. While Jean Valjean was building up for\nCosette a normal situation in society and an unassailable status, M.\nGillenormand was superintending the basket of wedding gifts. Nothing so\namused him as being magnificent. He had given to Cosette a robe of\nBinche guipure which had descended to him from his own grandmother.\n\n“These fashions come up again,” said he, “ancient things are the rage,\nand the young women of my old age dress like the old women of my\nchildhood.”\n\n\nHe rifled his respectable chests of drawers in Coromandel lacquer, with\nswelling fronts, which had not been opened for years.—“Let us hear the\nconfession of these dowagers,” he said, “let us see what they have in\ntheir paunches.” He noisily violated the pot-bellied drawers of all his\nwives, of all his mistresses and of all his grandmothers. Pekins,\ndamasks, lampas, painted moires, robes of shot gros de Tours, India\nkerchiefs embroidered in gold that could be washed, dauphines without a\nright or wrong side, in the piece, Genoa and Alençon point lace,\nparures in antique goldsmith’s work, ivory bon-bon boxes ornamented\nwith microscopic battles, gewgaws and ribbons—he lavished everything on\nCosette. Cosette, amazed, desperately in love with Marius, and wild\nwith gratitude towards M. Gillenormand, dreamed of a happiness without\nlimit clothed in satin and velvet. Her wedding basket seemed to her to\nbe upheld by seraphim. Her soul flew out into the azure depths, with\nwings of Mechlin lace.\n\nThe intoxication of the lovers was only equalled, as we have already\nsaid, by the ecstasy of the grandfather. A sort of flourish of trumpets\nwent on in the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire.\n\nEvery morning, a fresh offering of bric-à-brac from the grandfather to\nCosette. All possible knickknacks glittered around her.\n\nOne day Marius, who was fond of talking gravely in the midst of his\nbliss, said, apropos of I know not what incident:\n\n“The men of the revolution are so great, that they have the prestige of\nthe ages, like Cato and like Phocion, and each one of them seems to me\nan antique memory.”\n\n\n“Moire antique!” exclaimed the old gentleman. “Thanks, Marius. That is\nprecisely the idea of which I was in search.”\n\n\nAnd on the following day, a magnificent dress of tea-rose colored moire\nantique was added to Cosette’s wedding presents.\n\nFrom these fripperies, the grandfather extracted a bit of wisdom.\n\n“Love is all very well; but there must be something else to go with it.\nThe useless must be mingled with happiness. Happiness is only the\nnecessary. Season that enormously with the superfluous for me. A palace\nand her heart. Her heart and the Louvre. Her heart and the grand\nwaterworks of Versailles. Give me my shepherdess and try to make her a\nduchess. Fetch me Phyllis crowned with corn-flowers, and add a hundred\nthousand francs income. Open for me a bucolic perspective as far as you\ncan see, beneath a marble colonnade. I consent to the bucolic and also\nto the fairy spectacle of marble and gold. Dry happiness resembles dry\nbread. One eats, but one does not dine. I want the superfluous, the\nuseless, the extravagant, excess, that which serves no purpose. I\nremember to have seen, in the Cathedral of Strasburg, a clock, as tall\nas a three-story house which marked the hours, which had the kindness\nto indicate the hour, but which had not the air of being made for that;\nand which, after having struck midday, or midnight,—midday, the hour of\nthe sun, or midnight, the hour of love,—or any other hour that you\nlike, gave you the moon and the stars, the earth and the sea, birds and\nfishes, Phœbus and Phœbe, and a host of things which emerged from a\nniche, and the twelve apostles, and the Emperor Charles the Fifth, and\nÉponine, and Sabinus, and a throng of little gilded goodmen, who played\non the trumpet to boot. Without reckoning delicious chimes which it\nsprinkled through the air, on every occasion, without any one’s knowing\nwhy. Is a petty bald clock-face which merely tells the hour equal to\nthat? For my part, I am of the opinion of the big clock of Strasburg,\nand I prefer it to the cuckoo clock from the Black Forest.”\n\n\nM. Gillenormand talked nonsense in connection with the wedding, and all\nthe fripperies of the eighteenth century passed pell-mell through his\ndithyrambs.\n\n“You are ignorant of the art of festivals. You do not know how to\norganize a day of enjoyment in this age,” he exclaimed. “Your\nnineteenth century is weak. It lacks excess. It ignores the rich, it\nignores the noble. In everything it is clean-shaven. Your third estate\nis insipid, colorless, odorless, and shapeless. The dreams of your\nbourgeois who set up, as they express it: a pretty boudoir freshly\ndecorated, violet, ebony and calico. Make way! Make way! the Sieur\nCurmudgeon is marrying Mademoiselle Clutch-penny. Sumptuousness and\nsplendor. A louis d’or has been stuck to a candle. There’s the epoch\nfor you. My demand is that I may flee from it beyond the Sarmatians.\nAh! in 1787, I predict that all was lost, from the day when I beheld\nthe Duc de Rohan, Prince de Léon, Duc de Chabot, Duc de Montbazon,\nMarquis de Soubise, Vicomte de Thouars, peer of France, go to\nLongchamps in a tapecu! That has borne its fruits. In this century, men\nattend to business, they gamble on ‘Change, they win money, they are\nstingy. People take care of their surfaces and varnish them; every one\nis dressed as though just out of a bandbox, washed, soaped, scraped,\nshaved, combed, waked, smoothed, rubbed, brushed, cleaned on the\noutside, irreproachable, polished as a pebble, discreet, neat, and at\nthe same time, death of my life, in the depths of their consciences\nthey have dung-heaps and cesspools that are enough to make a cow-herd\nwho blows his nose in his fingers, recoil. I grant to this age the\ndevice: ‘Dirty Cleanliness.’ Don’t be vexed, Marius, give me permission\nto speak; I say no evil of the people as you see, I am always harping\non your people, but do look favorably on my dealing a bit of a slap to\nthe bourgeoisie. I belong to it. He who loves well lashes well.\nThereupon, I say plainly, that nowadays people marry, but that they no\nlonger know how to marry. Ah! it is true, I regret the grace of the\nancient manners. I regret everything about them, their elegance, their\nchivalry, those courteous and delicate ways, that joyous luxury which\nevery one possessed, music forming part of the wedding, a symphony\nabove stairs, a beating of drums below stairs, the dances, the joyous\nfaces round the table, the fine-spun gallant compliments, the songs,\nthe fireworks, the frank laughter, the devil’s own row, the huge knots\nof ribbon. I regret the bride’s garter. The bride’s garter is cousin to\nthe girdle of Venus. On what does the war of Troy turn? On Helen’s\ngarter, parbleu! Why did they fight, why did Diomed the divine break\nover the head of Meriones that great brazen helmet of ten points? why\ndid Achilles and Hector hew each other up with vast blows of their\nlances? Because Helen allowed Paris to take her garter. With Cosette’s\ngarter, Homer would construct the _Iliad_. He would put in his poem, a\nloquacious old fellow, like me, and he would call him Nestor. My\nfriends, in bygone days, in those amiable days of yore, people married\nwisely; they had a good contract, and then they had a good carouse. As\nsoon as Cujas had taken his departure, Gamacho entered. But, in sooth!\nthe stomach is an agreeable beast which demands its due, and which\nwants to have its wedding also. People supped well, and had at table a\nbeautiful neighbor without a guimpe so that her throat was only\nmoderately concealed. Oh! the large laughing mouths, and how gay we\nwere in those days! youth was a bouquet; every young man terminated in\na branch of lilacs or a tuft of roses; whether he was a shepherd or a\nwarrior; and if, by chance, one was a captain of dragoons, one found\nmeans to call oneself Florian. People thought much of looking well.\nThey embroidered and tinted themselves. A bourgeois had the air of a\nflower, a Marquis had the air of a precious stone. People had no straps\nto their boots, they had no boots. They were spruce, shining, waved,\nlustrous, fluttering, dainty, coquettish, which did not at all prevent\ntheir wearing swords by their sides. The humming-bird has beak and\nclaws. That was the day of the _Galland Indies_. One of the sides of\nthat century was delicate, the other was magnificent; and by the green\ncabbages! people amused themselves. To-day, people are serious. The\nbourgeois is avaricious, the bourgeoise is a prude; your century is\nunfortunate. People would drive away the Graces as being too low in the\nneck. Alas! beauty is concealed as though it were ugliness. Since the\nrevolution, everything, including the ballet-dancers, has had its\ntrousers; a mountebank dancer must be grave; your rigadoons are\ndoctrinarian. It is necessary to be majestic. People would be greatly\nannoyed if they did not carry their chins in their cravats. The ideal\nof an urchin of twenty when he marries, is to resemble M.\nRoyer-Collard. And do you know what one arrives at with that majesty?\nat being petty. Learn this: joy is not only joyous; it is great. But be\nin love gayly then, what the deuce! marry, when you marry, with fever\nand giddiness, and tumult, and the uproar of happiness! Be grave in\nchurch, well and good. But, as soon as the mass is finished, sarpejou!\nyou must make a dream whirl around the bride. A marriage should be\nroyal and chimerical; it should promenade its ceremony from the\ncathedral of Rheims to the pagoda of Chanteloup. I have a horror of a\npaltry wedding. Ventregoulette! be in Olympus for that one day, at\nleast. Be one of the gods. Ah! people might be sylphs. Games and\nLaughter, argiraspides; they are stupids. My friends, every recently\nmade bridegroom ought to be Prince Aldobrandini. Profit by that unique\nminute in life to soar away to the empyrean with the swans and the\neagles, even if you do have to fall back on the morrow into the\nbourgeoisie of the frogs. Don’t economize on the nuptials, do not prune\nthem of their splendors; don’t scrimp on the day when you beam. The\nwedding is not the housekeeping. Oh! if I were to carry out my fancy,\nit would be gallant, violins would be heard under the trees. Here is my\nprogramme: sky-blue and silver. I would mingle with the festival the\nrural divinities, I would convoke the Dryads and the Nereids. The\nnuptials of Amphitrite, a rosy cloud, nymphs with well dressed locks\nand entirely naked, an Academician offering quatrains to the goddess, a\nchariot drawn by marine monsters.\n\n“Triton trottait devant, et tirait de sa conque\nDes sons si ravissants qu’il ravissait quiconque!”65\n\n\n—there’s a festive programme, there’s a good one, or else I know\nnothing of such matters, deuce take it!”\n\n\nWhile the grandfather, in full lyrical effusion, was listening to\nhimself, Cosette and Marius grew intoxicated as they gazed freely at\neach other.\n\nAunt Gillenormand surveyed all this with her imperturbable placidity.\nWithin the last five or six months she had experienced a certain amount\nof emotions. Marius returned, Marius brought back bleeding, Marius\nbrought back from a barricade, Marius dead, then living, Marius\nreconciled, Marius betrothed, Marius wedding a poor girl, Marius\nwedding a millionairess. The six hundred thousand francs had been her\nlast surprise. Then, her indifference of a girl taking her first\ncommunion returned to her. She went regularly to service, told her\nbeads, read her euchology, mumbled _Aves_ in one corner of the house,\nwhile _I love you_ was being whispered in the other, and she beheld\nMarius and Cosette in a vague way, like two shadows. The shadow was\nherself.\n\nThere is a certain state of inert asceticism in which the soul,\nneutralized by torpor, a stranger to that which may be designated as\nthe business of living, receives no impressions, either human, or\npleasant or painful, with the exception of earthquakes and\ncatastrophes. This devotion, as Father Gillenormand said to his\ndaughter, corresponds to a cold in the head. You smell nothing of life.\nNeither any bad, nor any good odor.\n\nMoreover, the six hundred thousand francs had settled the elderly\nspinster’s indecision. Her father had acquired the habit of taking her\nso little into account, that he had not consulted her in the matter of\nconsent to Marius’ marriage. He had acted impetuously, according to his\nwont, having, a despot-turned slave, but a single thought,—to satisfy\nMarius. As for the aunt,—it had not even occurred to him that the aunt\nexisted, and that she could have an opinion of her own, and, sheep as\nshe was, this had vexed her. Somewhat resentful in her inmost soul, but\nimpassible externally, she had said to herself: “My father has settled\nthe question of the marriage without reference to me; I shall settle\nthe question of the inheritance without consulting him.” She was rich,\nin fact, and her father was not. She had reserved her decision on this\npoint. It is probable that, had the match been a poor one, she would\nhave left him poor. “So much the worse for my nephew! he is wedding a\nbeggar, let him be a beggar himself!” But Cosette’s half-million\npleased the aunt, and altered her inward situation so far as this pair\nof lovers were concerned. One owes some consideration to six hundred\nthousand francs, and it was evident that she could not do otherwise\nthan leave her fortune to these young people, since they did not need\nit.\n\nIt was arranged that the couple should live with the grandfather—M.\nGillenormand insisted on resigning to them his chamber, the finest in\nthe house. “That will make me young again,” he said. “It’s an old plan\nof mine. I have always entertained the idea of having a wedding in my\nchamber.”\n\n\nHe furnished this chamber with a multitude of elegant trifles. He had\nthe ceiling and walls hung with an extraordinary stuff, which he had by\nhim in the piece, and which he believed to have emanated from Utrecht\nwith a buttercup-colored satin ground, covered with velvet auricula\nblossoms.—“It was with that stuff,” said he, “that the bed of the\nDuchesse d’Anville at la Roche-Guyon was draped.”—On the chimney-piece,\nhe set a little figure in Saxe porcelain, carrying a muff against her\nnude stomach.\n\nM. Gillenormand’s library became the lawyer’s study, which Marius\nneeded; a study, it will be remembered, being required by the council\nof the order.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—THE EFFECTS OF DREAMS MINGLED WITH HAPPINESS\n\n\nThe lovers saw each other every day. Cosette came with M.\nFauchelevent.—“This is reversing things,” said Mademoiselle\nGillenormand, “to have the bride come to the house to do the courting\nlike this.” But Marius’ convalescence had caused the habit to become\nestablished, and the armchairs of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire,\nbetter adapted to interviews than the straw chairs of the Rue de\nl’Homme Armé, had rooted it. Marius and M. Fauchelevent saw each other,\nbut did not address each other. It seemed as though this had been\nagreed upon. Every girl needs a chaperon. Cosette could not have come\nwithout M. Fauchelevent. In Marius’ eyes, M. Fauchelevent was the\ncondition attached to Cosette. He accepted it. By dint of discussing\npolitical matters, vaguely and without precision, from the point of\nview of the general amelioration of the fate of all men, they came to\nsay a little more than “yes” and “no.” Once, on the subject of\neducation, which Marius wished to have free and obligatory, multiplied\nunder all forms lavished on every one, like the air and the sun in a\nword, respirable for the entire population, they were in unison, and\nthey almost conversed. M. Fauchelevent talked well, and even with a\ncertain loftiness of language—still he lacked something indescribable.\nM. Fauchelevent possessed something less and also something more, than\na man of the world.\n\nMarius, inwardly, and in the depths of his thought, surrounded with all\nsorts of mute questions this M. Fauchelevent, who was to him simply\nbenevolent and cold. There were moments when doubts as to his own\nrecollections occurred to him. There was a void in his memory, a black\nspot, an abyss excavated by four months of agony.—Many things had been\nlost therein. He had come to the point of asking himself whether it\nwere really a fact that he had seen M. Fauchelevent, so serious and so\ncalm a man, in the barricade.\n\nThis was not, however, the only stupor which the apparitions and the\ndisappearances of the past had left in his mind. It must not be\nsupposed that he was delivered from all those obsessions of the memory\nwhich force us, even when happy, even when satisfied, to glance sadly\nbehind us. The head which does not turn backwards towards horizons that\nhave vanished contains neither thought nor love. At times, Marius\nclasped his face between his hands, and the vague and tumultuous past\ntraversed the twilight which reigned in his brain. Again he beheld\nMabeuf fall, he heard Gavroche singing amid the grape-shot, he felt\nbeneath his lips the cold brow of Éponine; Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Jean\nProuvaire, Combeferre, Bossuet, Grantaire, all his friends rose erect\nbefore him, then dispersed into thin air. Were all those dear,\nsorrowful, valiant, charming or tragic beings merely dreams? had they\nactually existed? The revolt had enveloped everything in its smoke.\nThese great fevers create great dreams. He questioned himself; he felt\nhimself; all these vanished realities made him dizzy. Where were they\nall then? was it really true that all were dead? A fall into the\nshadows had carried off all except himself. It all seemed to him to\nhave disappeared as though behind the curtain of a theatre. There are\ncurtains like this which drop in life. God passes on to the following\nact.\n\nAnd he himself—was he actually the same man? He, the poor man, was\nrich; he, the abandoned, had a family; he, the despairing, was to marry\nCosette. It seemed to him that he had traversed a tomb, and that he had\nentered into it black and had emerged from it white, and in that tomb\nthe others had remained. At certain moments, all these beings of the\npast, returned and present, formed a circle around him, and\novershadowed him; then he thought of Cosette, and recovered his\nserenity; but nothing less than this felicity could have sufficed to\nefface that catastrophe.\n\nM. Fauchelevent almost occupied a place among these vanished beings.\nMarius hesitated to believe that the Fauchelevent of the barricade was\nthe same as this Fauchelevent in flesh and blood, sitting so gravely\nbeside Cosette. The first was, probably, one of those nightmares\noccasioned and brought back by his hours of delirium. However, the\nnatures of both men were rigid, no question from Marius to M.\nFauchelevent was possible. Such an idea had not even occurred to him.\nWe have already indicated this characteristic detail.\n\nTwo men who have a secret in common, and who, by a sort of tacit\nagreement, exchange not a word on the subject, are less rare than is\ncommonly supposed.\n\nOnce only, did Marius make the attempt. He introduced into the\nconversation the Rue de la Chanvrerie, and, turning to M. Fauchelevent,\nhe said to him:\n\n“Of course, you are acquainted with that street?”\n\n\n“What street?”\n\n\n“The Rue de la Chanvrerie.”\n\n\n“I have no idea of the name of that street,” replied M. Fauchelevent,\nin the most natural manner in the world.\n\nThe response which bore upon the name of the street and not upon the\nstreet itself, appeared to Marius to be more conclusive than it really\nwas.\n\n“Decidedly,” thought he, “I have been dreaming. I have been subject to\na hallucination. It was some one who resembled him. M. Fauchelevent was\nnot there.”’\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—TWO MEN IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND\n\n\nMarius’ enchantment, great as it was, could not efface from his mind\nother pre-occupations.\n\nWhile the wedding was in preparation, and while awaiting the date fixed\nupon, he caused difficult and scrupulous retrospective researches to be\nmade.\n\nHe owed gratitude in various quarters; he owed it on his father’s\naccount, he owed it on his own.\n\nThere was Thénardier; there was the unknown man who had brought him,\nMarius, back to M. Gillenormand.\n\nMarius endeavored to find these two men, not intending to marry, to be\nhappy, and to forget them, and fearing that, were these debts of\ngratitude not discharged, they would leave a shadow on his life, which\npromised so brightly for the future.\n\nIt was impossible for him to leave all these arrears of suffering\nbehind him, and he wished, before entering joyously into the future, to\nobtain a quittance from the past.\n\nThat Thénardier was a villain detracted nothing from the fact that he\nhad saved Colonel Pontmercy. Thénardier was a ruffian in the eyes of\nall the world except Marius.\n\nAnd Marius, ignorant of the real scene in the battle field of Waterloo,\nwas not aware of the peculiar detail, that his father, so far as\nThénardier was concerned was in the strange position of being indebted\nto the latter for his life, without being indebted to him for any\ngratitude.\n\nNone of the various agents whom Marius employed succeeded in\ndiscovering any trace of Thénardier. Obliteration appeared to be\ncomplete in that quarter. Madame Thénardier had died in prison pending\nthe trial. Thénardier and his daughter Azelma, the only two remaining\nof that lamentable group, had plunged back into the gloom. The gulf of\nthe social unknown had silently closed above those beings. On the\nsurface there was not visible so much as that quiver, that trembling,\nthose obscure concentric circles which announce that something has\nfallen in, and that the plummet may be dropped.\n\nMadame Thénardier being dead, Boulatruelle being eliminated from the\ncase, Claquesous having disappeared, the principal persons accused\nhaving escaped from prison, the trial connected with the ambush in the\nGorbeau house had come to nothing.\n\nThat affair had remained rather obscure. The bench of Assizes had been\nobliged to content themselves with two subordinates. Panchaud, alias\nPrintanier, alias Bigrenaille, and Demi-Liard, alias Deux-Milliards,\nwho had been inconsistently condemned, after a hearing of both sides of\nthe case, to ten years in the galleys. Hard labor for life had been the\nsentence pronounced against the escaped and contumacious accomplices.\n\nThénardier, the head and leader, had been, through contumacy, likewise\ncondemned to death.\n\nThis sentence was the only information remaining about Thénardier,\ncasting upon that buried name its sinister light like a candle beside a\nbier.\n\nMoreover, by thrusting Thénardier back into the very remotest depths,\nthrough a fear of being re-captured, this sentence added to the density\nof the shadows which enveloped this man.\n\nAs for the other person, as for the unknown man who had saved Marius,\nthe researches were at first to some extent successful, then came to an\nabrupt conclusion. They succeeded in finding the carriage which had\nbrought Marius to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire on the evening of the\n6th of June.\n\nThe coachman declared that, on the 6th of June, in obedience to the\ncommands of a police-agent, he had stood from three o’clock in the\nafternoon until nightfall on the Quai des Champs-Élysées, above the\noutlet of the Grand Sewer; that, towards nine o’clock in the evening,\nthe grating of the sewer, which abuts on the bank of the river, had\nopened; that a man had emerged therefrom, bearing on his shoulders\nanother man, who seemed to be dead; that the agent, who was on the\nwatch at that point, had arrested the living man and had seized the\ndead man; that, at the order of the police-agent, he, the coachman, had\ntaken “all those folks” into his carriage; that they had first driven\nto the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; that they had there deposited the\ndead man; that the dead man was Monsieur Marius, and that he, the\ncoachman, recognized him perfectly, although he was alive “this time”;\nthat afterwards, they had entered the vehicle again, that he had\nwhipped up his horses; a few paces from the gate of the Archives, they\nhad called to him to halt; that there, in the street, they had paid him\nand left him, and that the police-agent had led the other man away;\nthat he knew nothing more; that the night had been very dark.\n\nMarius, as we have said, recalled nothing. He only remembered that he\nhad been seized from behind by an energetic hand at the moment when he\nwas falling backwards into the barricade; then, everything vanished so\nfar as he was concerned.\n\nHe had only regained consciousness at M. Gillenormand’s.\n\nHe was lost in conjectures.\n\nHe could not doubt his own identity. Still, how had it come to pass\nthat, having fallen in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, he had been picked up\nby the police-agent on the banks of the Seine, near the Pont des\nInvalides?\n\nSome one had carried him from the Quartier des Halles to the\nChamps-Élysées. And how? Through the sewer. Unheard-of devotion!\n\nSome one? Who?\n\nThis was the man for whom Marius was searching.\n\nOf this man, who was his savior, nothing; not a trace; not the faintest\nindication.\n\nMarius, although forced to preserve great reserve, in that direction,\npushed his inquiries as far as the prefecture of police. There, no more\nthan elsewhere, did the information obtained lead to any enlightenment.\n\nThe prefecture knew less about the matter than did the\nhackney-coachman. They had no knowledge of any arrest having been made\non the 6th of June at the mouth of the Grand Sewer.\n\nNo report of any agent had been received there upon this matter, which\nwas regarded at the prefecture as a fable. The invention of this fable\nwas attributed to the coachman.\n\nA coachman who wants a gratuity is capable of anything, even of\nimagination. The fact was assured, nevertheless, and Marius could not\ndoubt it, unless he doubted his own identity, as we have just said.\n\nEverything about this singular enigma was inexplicable.\n\nWhat had become of that man, that mysterious man, whom the coachman had\nseen emerge from the grating of the Grand Sewer bearing upon his back\nthe unconscious Marius, and whom the police-agent on the watch had\narrested in the very act of rescuing an insurgent? What had become of\nthe agent himself?\n\nWhy had this agent preserved silence? Had the man succeeded in making\nhis escape? Had he bribed the agent? Why did this man give no sign of\nlife to Marius, who owed everything to him? His disinterestedness was\nno less tremendous than his devotion. Why had not that man appeared\nagain? Perhaps he was above compensation, but no one is above\ngratitude. Was he dead? Who was the man? What sort of a face had he? No\none could tell him this.\n\nThe coachman answered: “The night was very dark.” Basque and Nicolette,\nall in a flutter, had looked only at their young master all covered\nwith blood.\n\nThe porter, whose candle had lighted the tragic arrival of Marius, had\nbeen the only one to take note of the man in question, and this is the\ndescription that he gave:\n\n“That man was terrible.”\n\n\nMarius had the blood-stained clothing which he had worn when he had\nbeen brought back to his grandfather preserved, in the hope that it\nwould prove of service in his researches.\n\nOn examining the coat, it was found that one skirt had been torn in a\nsingular way. A piece was missing.\n\nOne evening, Marius was speaking in the presence of Cosette and Jean\nValjean of the whole of that singular adventure, of the innumerable\ninquiries which he had made, and of the fruitlessness of his efforts.\nThe cold countenance of “Monsieur Fauchelevent” angered him.\n\nHe exclaimed, with a vivacity which had something of wrath in it:\n\n“Yes, that man, whoever he may have been, was sublime. Do you know what\nhe did, sir? He intervened like an archangel. He must have flung\nhimself into the midst of the battle, have stolen me away, have opened\nthe sewer, have dragged me into it and have carried me through it! He\nmust have traversed more than a league and a half in those frightful\nsubterranean galleries, bent over, weighed down, in the dark, in the\ncesspool,—more than a league and a half, sir, with a corpse upon his\nback! And with what object? With the sole object of saving the corpse.\nAnd that corpse I was. He said to himself: ‘There may still be a\nglimpse of life there, perchance; I will risk my own existence for that\nmiserable spark!’ And his existence he risked not once but twenty\ntimes! And every step was a danger. The proof of it is, that on\nemerging from the sewer, he was arrested. Do you know, sir, that that\nman did all this? And he had no recompense to expect. What was I? An\ninsurgent. What was I? One of the conquered. Oh! if Cosette’s six\nhundred thousand francs were mine….”\n\n\n“They are yours,” interrupted Jean Valjean.\n\n“Well,” resumed Marius, “I would give them all to find that man once\nmore.”\n\n\nJean Valjean remained silent.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SIXTH—THE SLEEPLESS NIGHT\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE 16TH OF FEBRUARY, 1833\n\n\nThe night of the 16th to the 17th of February, 1833, was a blessed\nnight. Above its shadows heaven stood open. It was the wedding night of\nMarius and Cosette.\n\nThe day had been adorable.\n\nIt had not been the grand festival dreamed by the grandfather, a fairy\nspectacle, with a confusion of cherubim and Cupids over the heads of\nthe bridal pair, a marriage worthy to form the subject of a painting to\nbe placed over a door; but it had been sweet and smiling.\n\nThe manner of marriage in 1833 was not the same as it is to-day. France\nhad not yet borrowed from England that supreme delicacy of carrying off\none’s wife, of fleeing, on coming out of church, of hiding oneself with\nshame from one’s happiness, and of combining the ways of a bankrupt\nwith the delights of the Song of Songs. People had not yet grasped to\nthe full the chastity, exquisiteness, and decency of jolting their\nparadise in a posting-chaise, of breaking up their mystery with\nclic-clacs, of taking for a nuptial bed the bed of an inn, and of\nleaving behind them, in a commonplace chamber, at so much a night, the\nmost sacred of the souvenirs of life mingled pell-mell with the\ntête-à-tête of the conductor of the diligence and the maid-servant of\nthe inn.\n\nIn this second half of the nineteenth century in which we are now\nliving, the mayor and his scarf, the priest and his chasuble, the law\nand God no longer suffice; they must be eked out by the Postilion de\nLonjumeau; a blue waistcoat turned up with red, and with bell buttons,\na plaque like a vantbrace, knee-breeches of green leather, oaths to the\nNorman horses with their tails knotted up, false galloons, varnished\nhat, long powdered locks, an enormous whip and tall boots. France does\nnot yet carry elegance to the length of doing like the English\nnobility, and raining down on the post-chaise of the bridal pair a hail\nstorm of slippers trodden down at heel and of worn-out shoes, in memory\nof Churchill, afterwards Marlborough, or Malbrouck, who was assailed on\nhis wedding-day by the wrath of an aunt which brought him good luck.\nOld shoes and slippers do not, as yet, form a part of our nuptial\ncelebrations; but patience, as good taste continues to spread, we shall\ncome to that.\n\nIn 1833, a hundred years ago, marriage was not conducted at a full\ntrot.\n\nStrange to say, at that epoch, people still imagined that a wedding was\na private and social festival, that a patriarchal banquet does not\nspoil a domestic solemnity, that gayety, even in excess, provided it be\nhonest, and decent, does happiness no harm, and that, in short, it is a\ngood and a venerable thing that the fusion of these two destinies\nwhence a family is destined to spring, should begin at home, and that\nthe household should thenceforth have its nuptial chamber as its\nwitness.\n\nAnd people were so immodest as to marry in their own homes.\n\nThe marriage took place, therefore, in accordance with this now\nsuperannuated fashion, at M. Gillenormand’s house.\n\nNatural and commonplace as this matter of marrying is, the banns to\npublish, the papers to be drawn up, the mayoralty, and the church\nproduce some complication. They could not get ready before the 16th of\nFebruary.\n\nNow, we note this detail, for the pure satisfaction of being exact, it\nchanced that the 16th fell on Shrove Tuesday. Hesitations, scruples,\nparticularly on the part of Aunt Gillenormand.\n\n“Shrove Tuesday!” exclaimed the grandfather, “so much the better. There\nis a proverb:\n\n“‘Mariage un Mardi gras\nN’aura point enfants ingrats.‘66\n\n\nLet us proceed. Here goes for the 16th! Do you want to delay, Marius?”\n\n\n“No, certainly not!” replied the lover.\n\n“Let us marry, then,” cried the grandfather.\n\nAccordingly, the marriage took place on the 16th, notwithstanding the\npublic merrymaking. It rained that day, but there is always in the sky\na tiny scrap of blue at the service of happiness, which lovers see,\neven when the rest of creation is under an umbrella.\n\nOn the preceding evening, Jean Valjean handed to Marius, in the\npresence of M. Gillenormand, the five hundred and eighty-four thousand\nfrancs.\n\nAs the marriage was taking place under the régime of community of\nproperty, the papers had been simple.\n\nHenceforth, Toussaint was of no use to Jean Valjean; Cosette inherited\nher and promoted her to the rank of lady’s maid.\n\nAs for Jean Valjean, a beautiful chamber in the Gillenormand house had\nbeen furnished expressly for him, and Cosette had said to him in such\nan irresistible manner: “Father, I entreat you,” that she had almost\npersuaded him to promise that he would come and occupy it.\n\nA few days before that fixed on for the marriage, an accident happened\nto Jean Valjean; he crushed the thumb of his right hand. This was not a\nserious matter; and he had not allowed any one to trouble himself about\nit, nor to dress it, nor even to see his hurt, not even Cosette.\nNevertheless, this had forced him to swathe his hand in a linen\nbandage, and to carry his arm in a sling, and had prevented his\nsigning. M. Gillenormand, in his capacity of Cosette’s\nsupervising-guardian, had supplied his place.\n\nWe will not conduct the reader either to the mayor’s office or to the\nchurch. One does not follow a pair of lovers to that extent, and one is\naccustomed to turn one’s back on the drama as soon as it puts a wedding\nnosegay in its buttonhole. We will confine ourselves to noting an\nincident which, though unnoticed by the wedding party, marked the\ntransit from the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire to the church of\nSaint-Paul.\n\nAt that epoch, the northern extremity of the Rue Saint-Louis was in\nprocess of repaving. It was barred off, beginning with the Rue du\nParc-Royal. It was impossible for the wedding carriages to go directly\nto Saint-Paul. They were obliged to alter their course, and the\nsimplest way was to turn through the boulevard. One of the invited\nguests observed that it was Shrove Tuesday, and that there would be a\njam of vehicles.—“Why?” asked M. Gillenormand—“Because of the\nmaskers.”—“Capital,” said the grandfather, “let us go that way. These\nyoung folks are on the way to be married; they are about to enter the\nserious part of life. This will prepare them for seeing a bit of the\nmasquerade.”\n\n\nThey went by way of the boulevard. The first wedding coach held Cosette\nand Aunt Gillenormand, M. Gillenormand and Jean Valjean. Marius, still\nseparated from his betrothed according to usage, did not come until the\nsecond. The nuptial train, on emerging from the Rue des\nFilles-du-Calvaire, became entangled in a long procession of vehicles\nwhich formed an endless chain from the Madeleine to the Bastille, and\nfrom the Bastille to the Madeleine. Maskers abounded on the boulevard.\nIn spite of the fact that it was raining at intervals, Merry-Andrew,\nPantaloon and Clown persisted. In the good humor of that winter of\n1833, Paris had disguised itself as Venice. Such Shrove Tuesdays are no\nlonger to be seen nowadays. Everything which exists being a scattered\nCarnival, there is no longer any Carnival.\n\nThe sidewalks were overflowing with pedestrians and the windows with\ncurious spectators. The terraces which crown the peristyles of the\ntheatres were bordered with spectators. Besides the maskers, they\nstared at that procession—peculiar to Shrove Tuesday as to\nLongchamps,—of vehicles of every description, citadines, tapissières,\ncarioles, cabriolets marching in order, rigorously riveted to each\nother by the police regulations, and locked into rails, as it were. Any\none in these vehicles is at once a spectator and a spectacle. Police\nsergeants maintained, on the sides of the boulevard, these two\ninterminable parallel files, moving in contrary directions, and saw to\nit that nothing interfered with that double current, those two brooks\nof carriages, flowing, the one downstream, the other upstream, the one\ntowards the Chaussée d’Antin, the other towards the Faubourg\nSaint-Antoine. The carriages of the peers of France and of the\nAmbassadors, emblazoned with coats of arms, held the middle of the way,\ngoing and coming freely. Certain joyous and magnificent trains, notably\nthat of the Bœuf Gras, had the same privilege. In this gayety of Paris,\nEngland cracked her whip; Lord Seymour’s post-chaise, harassed by a\nnickname from the populace, passed with great noise.\n\nIn the double file, along which the municipal guards galloped like\nsheep-dogs, honest family coaches, loaded down with great-aunts and\ngrandmothers, displayed at their doors fresh groups of children in\ndisguise, Clowns of seven years of age, Columbines of six, ravishing\nlittle creatures, who felt that they formed an official part of the\npublic mirth, who were imbued with the dignity of their harlequinade,\nand who possessed the gravity of functionaries.\n\nFrom time to time, a hitch arose somewhere in the procession of\nvehicles; one or other of the two lateral files halted until the knot\nwas disentangled; one carriage delayed sufficed to paralyze the whole\nline. Then they set out again on the march.\n\nThe wedding carriages were in the file proceeding towards the Bastille,\nand skirting the right side of the Boulevard. At the top of the\nPont-aux-Choux, there was a stoppage. Nearly at the same moment, the\nother file, which was proceeding towards the Madeleine, halted also. At\nthat point of the file there was a carriage-load of maskers.\n\nThese carriages, or to speak more correctly, these wagon-loads of\nmaskers are very familiar to Parisians. If they were missing on a\nShrove Tuesday, or at the Mid-Lent, it would be taken in bad part, and\npeople would say: “There’s something behind that. Probably the ministry\nis about to undergo a change.” A pile of Cassandras, Harlequins and\nColumbines, jolted along high above the passers-by, all possible\ngrotesquenesses, from the Turk to the savage, Hercules supporting\nMarquises, fishwives who would have made Rabelais stop up his ears just\nas the Mænads made Aristophanes drop his eyes, tow wigs, pink tights,\ndandified hats, spectacles of a grimacer, three-cornered hats of Janot\ntormented with a butterfly, shouts directed at pedestrians, fists on\nhips, bold attitudes, bare shoulders, immodesty unchained; a chaos of\nshamelessness driven by a coachman crowned with flowers; this is what\nthat institution was like.\n\nGreece stood in need of the chariot of Thespis, France stands in need\nof the hackney-coach of Vadé.\n\nEverything can be parodied, even parody. The Saturnalia, that grimace\nof antique beauty, ends, through exaggeration after exaggeration, in\nShrove Tuesday; and the Bacchanal, formerly crowned with sprays of vine\nleaves and grapes, inundated with sunshine, displaying her marble\nbreast in a divine semi-nudity, having at the present day lost her\nshape under the soaked rags of the North, has finally come to be called\nthe Jack-pudding.\n\nThe tradition of carriage-loads of maskers runs back to the most\nancient days of the monarchy. The accounts of Louis XI. allot to the\nbailiff of the palace “twenty sous, Tournois, for three coaches of\nmascarades in the crossroads.” In our day, these noisy heaps of\ncreatures are accustomed to have themselves driven in some ancient\ncuckoo carriage, whose imperial they load down, or they overwhelm a\nhired landau, with its top thrown back, with their tumultuous groups.\nTwenty of them ride in a carriage intended for six. They cling to the\nseats, to the rumble, on the cheeks of the hood, on the shafts. They\neven bestride the carriage lamps. They stand, sit, lie, with their\nknees drawn up in a knot, and their legs hanging. The women sit on the\nmen’s laps. Far away, above the throng of heads, their wild pyramid is\nvisible. These carriage-loads form mountains of mirth in the midst of\nthe rout. Collé, Panard and Piron flow from it, enriched with slang.\nThis carriage which has become colossal through its freight, has an air\nof conquest. Uproar reigns in front, tumult behind. People vociferate,\nshout, howl, there they break forth and writhe with enjoyment; gayety\nroars; sarcasm flames forth, joviality is flaunted like a red flag; two\njades there drag farce blossomed forth into an apotheosis; it is the\ntriumphal car of laughter.\n\nA laughter that is too cynical to be frank. In truth, this laughter is\nsuspicious. This laughter has a mission. It is charged with proving the\nCarnival to the Parisians.\n\nThese fishwife vehicles, in which one feels one knows not what shadows,\nset the philosopher to thinking. There is government therein. There one\nlays one’s finger on a mysterious affinity between public men and\npublic women.\n\nIt certainly is sad that turpitude heaped up should give a sum total of\ngayety, that by piling ignominy upon opprobrium the people should be\nenticed, that the system of spying, and serving as caryatids to\nprostitution should amuse the rabble when it confronts them, that the\ncrowd loves to behold that monstrous living pile of tinsel rags, half\ndung, half light, roll by on four wheels howling and laughing, that\nthey should clap their hands at this glory composed of all shames, that\nthere would be no festival for the populace, did not the police\npromenade in their midst these sorts of twenty-headed hydras of joy.\nBut what can be done about it? These be-ribboned and be-flowered\ntumbrils of mire are insulted and pardoned by the laughter of the\npublic. The laughter of all is the accomplice of universal degradation.\nCertain unhealthy festivals disaggregate the people and convert them\ninto the populace. And populaces, like tyrants, require buffoons. The\nKing has Roquelaure, the populace has the Merry-Andrew. Paris is a\ngreat, mad city on every occasion that it is a great sublime city.\nThere the Carnival forms part of politics. Paris,—let us confess\nit—willingly allows infamy to furnish it with comedy. She only demands\nof her masters—when she has masters—one thing: “Paint me the mud.” Rome\nwas of the same mind. She loved Nero. Nero was a titanic lighterman.\n\nChance ordained, as we have just said, that one of these shapeless\nclusters of masked men and women, dragged about on a vast calash,\nshould halt on the left of the boulevard, while the wedding train\nhalted on the right. The carriage-load of masks caught sight of the\nwedding carriage containing the bridal party opposite them on the other\nside of the boulevard.\n\n“Hullo!” said a masker, “here’s a wedding.”\n\n\n“A sham wedding,” retorted another. “We are the genuine article.”\n\n\nAnd, being too far off to accost the wedding party, and fearing also,\nthe rebuke of the police, the two maskers turned their eyes elsewhere.\n\nAt the end of another minute, the carriage-load of maskers had their\nhands full, the multitude set to yelling, which is the crowd’s caress\nto masquerades; and the two maskers who had just spoken had to face the\nthrong with their comrades, and did not find the entire repertory of\nprojectiles of the fishmarkets too extensive to retort to the enormous\nverbal attacks of the populace. A frightful exchange of metaphors took\nplace between the maskers and the crowd.\n\nIn the meanwhile, two other maskers in the same carriage, a Spaniard\nwith an enormous nose, an elderly air, and huge black moustache, and a\ngaunt fishwife, who was quite a young girl, masked with a _loup_,67 had\nalso noticed the wedding, and while their companions and the passers-by\nwere exchanging insults, they had held a dialogue in a low voice.\n\nTheir aside was covered by the tumult and was lost in it. The gusts of\nrain had drenched the front of the vehicle, which was wide open; the\nbreezes of February are not warm; as the fishwife, clad in a low-necked\ngown, replied to the Spaniard, she shivered, laughed and coughed.\n\nHere is their dialogue:\n\n“Say, now.”\n\n\n“What, daddy?”\n\n\n“Do you see that old cove?”\n\n\n“What old cove?”\n\n\n“Yonder, in the first wedding-cart, on our side.”\n\n\n“The one with his arm hung up in a black cravat?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Well?”\n\n\n“I’m sure that I know him.”\n\n\n“Ah!”\n\n\n“I’m willing that they should cut my throat, and I’m ready to swear\nthat I never said either you, thou, or I, in my life, if I don’t know\nthat Parisian.” [_pantinois_.]\n\n“Paris in Pantin to-day.”\n\n\n“Can you see the bride if you stoop down?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“And the bridegroom?”\n\n\n“There’s no bridegroom in that trap.”\n\n\n“Bah!”\n\n\n“Unless it’s the old fellow.”\n\n\n“Try to get a sight of the bride by stooping very low.”\n\n\n“I can’t.”\n\n\n“Never mind, that old cove who has something the matter with his paw I\nknow, and that I’m positive.”\n\n\n“And what good does it do to know him?”\n\n\n“No one can tell. Sometimes it does!”\n\n\n“I don’t care a hang for old fellows, that I don’t!”\n\n\n“I know him.”\n\n\n“Know him, if you want to.”\n\n\n“How the devil does he come to be one of the wedding party?”\n\n\n“We are in it, too.”\n\n\n“Where does that wedding come from?”\n\n\n“How should I know?”\n\n\n“Listen.”\n\n\n“Well, what?”\n\n\n“There’s one thing you ought to do.”\n\n\n“What’s that?”\n\n\n“Get off of our trap and spin that wedding.”\n\n\n“What for?”\n\n\n“To find out where it goes, and what it is. Hurry up and jump down,\ntrot, my girl, your legs are young.”\n\n\n“I can’t quit the vehicle.”\n\n\n“Why not?”\n\n\n“I’m hired.”\n\n\n“Ah, the devil!”\n\n\n“I owe my fishwife day to the prefecture.”\n\n\n“That’s true.”\n\n\n“If I leave the cart, the first inspector who gets his eye on me will\narrest me. You know that well enough.”\n\n\n“Yes, I do.”\n\n\n“I’m bought by the government for to-day.”\n\n\n“All the same, that old fellow bothers me.”\n\n\n“Do the old fellows bother you? But you’re not a young girl.”\n\n\n“He’s in the first carriage.”\n\n\n“Well?”\n\n\n“In the bride’s trap.”\n\n\n“What then?”\n\n\n“So he is the father.”\n\n\n“What concern is that of mine?”\n\n\n“I tell you that he’s the father.”\n\n\n“As if he were the only father.”\n\n\n“Listen.”\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“I can’t go out otherwise than masked. Here I’m concealed, no one knows\nthat I’m here. But to-morrow, there will be no more maskers. It’s Ash\nWednesday. I run the risk of being nabbed. I must sneak back into my\nhole. But you are free.”\n\n\n“Not particularly.”\n\n\n“More than I am, at any rate.”\n\n\n“Well, what of that?”\n\n\n“You must try to find out where that wedding party went to.”\n\n\n“Where it went?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“I know.”\n\n\n“Where is it going then?”\n\n\n“To the Cadran-Bleu.”\n\n\n“In the first place, it’s not in that direction.”\n\n\n“Well! to la Rapée.”\n\n\n“Or elsewhere.”\n\n\n“It’s free. Wedding parties are at liberty.”\n\n\n“That’s not the point at all. I tell you that you must try to learn for\nme what that wedding is, who that old cove belongs to, and where that\nwedding pair lives.”\n\n\n“I like that! that would be queer. It’s so easy to find out a wedding\nparty that passed through the street on a Shrove Tuesday, a week\nafterwards. A pin in a hay-mow! It ain’t possible!”\n\n\n“That don’t matter. You must try. You understand me, Azelma.”\n\n\nThe two files resumed their movement on both sides of the boulevard, in\nopposite directions, and the carriage of the maskers lost sight of the\n“trap” of the bride.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—JEAN VALJEAN STILL WEARS HIS ARM IN A SLING\n\n\nTo realize one’s dream. To whom is this accorded? There must be\nelections for this in heaven; we are all candidates, unknown to\nourselves; the angels vote. Cosette and Marius had been elected.\n\nCosette, both at the mayor’s office and at church, was dazzling and\ntouching. Toussaint, assisted by Nicolette, had dressed her.\n\nCosette wore over a petticoat of white taffeta, her robe of Binche\nguipure, a veil of English point, a necklace of fine pearls, a wreath\nof orange flowers; all this was white, and, from the midst of that\nwhiteness she beamed forth. It was an exquisite candor expanding and\nbecoming transfigured in the light. One would have pronounced her a\nvirgin on the point of turning into a goddess.\n\nMarius’ handsome hair was lustrous and perfumed; here and there,\nbeneath the thick curls, pale lines—the scars of the barricade—were\nvisible.\n\nThe grandfather, haughty, with head held high, amalgamating more than\never in his toilet and his manners all the elegances of the epoch of\nBarras, escorted Cosette. He took the place of Jean Valjean, who, on\naccount of his arm being still in a sling, could not give his hand to\nthe bride.\n\nJean Valjean, dressed in black, followed them with a smile.\n\n“Monsieur Fauchelevent,” said the grandfather to him, “this is a fine\nday. I vote for the end of afflictions and sorrows. Henceforth, there\nmust be no sadness anywhere. Pardieu, I decree joy! Evil has no right\nto exist. That there should be any unhappy men is, in sooth, a disgrace\nto the azure of the sky. Evil does not come from man, who is good at\nbottom. All human miseries have for their capital and central\ngovernment hell, otherwise, known as the Devil’s Tuileries. Good, here\nI am uttering demagogical words! As far as I am concerned, I have no\nlonger any political opinions; let all men be rich, that is to say,\nmirthful, and I confine myself to that.”\n\n\nWhen, at the conclusion of all the ceremonies, after having pronounced\nbefore the mayor and before the priest all possible “yesses,” after\nhaving signed the registers at the municipality and at the sacristy,\nafter having exchanged their rings, after having knelt side by side\nunder the pall of white moire in the smoke of the censer, they arrived,\nhand in hand, admired and envied by all, Marius in black, she in white,\npreceded by the suisse, with the epaulets of a colonel, tapping the\npavement with his halberd, between two rows of astonished spectators,\nat the portals of the church, both leaves of which were thrown wide\nopen, ready to enter their carriage again, and all being finished,\nCosette still could not believe that it was real. She looked at Marius,\nshe looked at the crowd, she looked at the sky: it seemed as though she\nfeared that she should wake up from her dream. Her amazed and uneasy\nair added something indescribably enchanting to her beauty. They\nentered the same carriage to return home, Marius beside Cosette; M.\nGillenormand and Jean Valjean sat opposite them; Aunt Gillenormand had\nwithdrawn one degree, and was in the second vehicle.\n\n“My children,” said the grandfather, “here you are, Monsieur le Baron\nand Madame la Baronne, with an income of thirty thousand livres.”\n\n\nAnd Cosette, nestling close to Marius, caressed his ear with an angelic\nwhisper: “So it is true. My name is Marius. I am Madame Thou.”\n\n\nThese two creatures were resplendent. They had reached that irrevocable\nand irrecoverable moment, at the dazzling intersection of all youth and\nall joy. They realized the verses of Jean Prouvaire; they were forty\nyears old taken together. It was marriage sublimated; these two\nchildren were two lilies. They did not see each other, they did not\ncontemplate each other. Cosette perceived Marius in the midst of a\nglory; Marius perceived Cosette on an altar. And on that altar, and in\nthat glory, the two apotheoses mingling, in the background, one knows\nnot how, behind a cloud for Cosette, in a flash for Marius, there was\nthe ideal thing, the real thing, the meeting of the kiss and the dream,\nthe nuptial pillow. All the torments through which they had passed came\nback to them in intoxication. It seemed to them that their sorrows,\ntheir sleepless nights, their tears, their anguish, their terrors,\ntheir despair, converted into caresses and rays of light, rendered\nstill more charming the charming hour which was approaching; and that\ntheir griefs were but so many handmaidens who were preparing the toilet\nof joy. How good it is to have suffered! Their unhappiness formed a\nhalo round their happiness. The long agony of their love was\nterminating in an ascension.\n\nIt was the same enchantment in two souls, tinged with voluptuousness in\nMarius, and with modesty in Cosette. They said to each other in low\ntones: “We will go back to take a look at our little garden in the Rue\nPlumet.” The folds of Cosette’s gown lay across Marius.\n\nSuch a day is an ineffable mixture of dream and of reality. One\npossesses and one supposes. One still has time before one to divine.\nThe emotion on that day, of being at midday and of dreaming of midnight\nis indescribable. The delights of these two hearts overflowed upon the\ncrowd, and inspired the passers-by with cheerfulness.\n\nPeople halted in the Rue Saint-Antoine, in front of Saint-Paul, to gaze\nthrough the windows of the carriage at the orange-flowers quivering on\nCosette’s head.\n\nThen they returned home to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. Marius,\ntriumphant and radiant, mounted side by side with Cosette the staircase\nup which he had been borne in a dying condition. The poor, who had\ntrooped to the door, and who shared their purses, blessed them. There\nwere flowers everywhere. The house was no less fragrant than the\nchurch; after the incense, roses. They thought they heard voices\ncarolling in the infinite; they had God in their hearts; destiny\nappeared to them like a ceiling of stars; above their heads they beheld\nthe light of a rising sun. All at once, the clock struck. Marius\nglanced at Cosette’s charming bare arm, and at the rosy things which\nwere vaguely visible through the lace of her bodice, and Cosette,\nintercepting Marius’ glance, blushed to her very hair.\n\nQuite a number of old family friends of the Gillenormand family had\nbeen invited; they pressed about Cosette. Each one vied with the rest\nin saluting her as Madame la Baronne.\n\nThe officer, Théodule Gillenormand, now a captain, had come from\nChartres, where he was stationed in garrison, to be present at the\nwedding of his cousin Pontmercy. Cosette did not recognize him.\n\nHe, on his side, habituated as he was to have women consider him\nhandsome, retained no more recollection of Cosette than of any other\nwoman.\n\n“How right I was not to believe in that story about the lancer!” said\nFather Gillenormand, to himself.\n\nCosette had never been more tender with Jean Valjean. She was in unison\nwith Father Gillenormand; while he erected joy into aphorisms and\nmaxims, she exhaled goodness like a perfume. Happiness desires that all\nthe world should be happy.\n\nShe regained, for the purpose of addressing Jean Valjean, inflections\nof voice belonging to the time when she was a little girl. She caressed\nhim with her smile.\n\nA banquet had been spread in the dining-room.\n\nIllumination as brilliant as the daylight is the necessary seasoning of\na great joy. Mist and obscurity are not accepted by the happy. They do\nnot consent to be black. The night, yes; the shadows, no. If there is\nno sun, one must be made.\n\nThe dining-room was full of gay things. In the centre, above the white\nand glittering table, was a Venetian lustre with flat plates, with all\nsorts of colored birds, blue, violet, red, and green, perched amid the\ncandles; around the chandelier, girandoles, on the walls, sconces with\ntriple and quintuple branches; mirrors, silverware, glassware, plate,\nporcelain, faïence, pottery, gold and silversmith’s work, all was\nsparkling and gay. The empty spaces between the candelabra were filled\nin with bouquets, so that where there was not a light, there was a\nflower.\n\nIn the antechamber, three violins and a flute softly played quartettes\nby Haydn.\n\nJean Valjean had seated himself on a chair in the drawing-room, behind\nthe door, the leaf of which folded back upon him in such a manner as to\nnearly conceal him. A few moments before they sat down to table,\nCosette came, as though inspired by a sudden whim, and made him a deep\ncourtesy, spreading out her bridal toilet with both hands, and with a\ntenderly roguish glance, she asked him:\n\n“Father, are you satisfied?”\n\n\n“Yes,” said Jean Valjean, “I am content!”\n\n\n“Well, then, laugh.”\n\n\nJean Valjean began to laugh.\n\nA few moments later, Basque announced that dinner was served.\n\nThe guests, preceded by M. Gillenormand with Cosette on his arm,\nentered the dining-room, and arranged themselves in the proper order\naround the table.\n\nTwo large armchairs figured on the right and left of the bride, the\nfirst for M. Gillenormand, the other for Jean Valjean. M. Gillenormand\ntook his seat. The other armchair remained empty.\n\nThey looked about for M. Fauchelevent.\n\nHe was no longer there.\n\nM. Gillenormand questioned Basque.\n\n“Do you know where M. Fauchelevent is?”\n\n\n“Sir,” replied Basque, “I do, precisely. M. Fauchelevent told me to say\nto you, sir, that he was suffering, his injured hand was paining him\nsomewhat, and that he could not dine with Monsieur le Baron and Madame\nla Baronne. That he begged to be excused, that he would come to-morrow.\nHe has just taken his departure.”\n\n\nThat empty armchair chilled the effusion of the wedding feast for a\nmoment. But, if M. Fauchelevent was absent, M. Gillenormand was\npresent, and the grandfather beamed for two. He affirmed that M.\nFauchelevent had done well to retire early, if he were suffering, but\nthat it was only a slight ailment. This declaration sufficed. Moreover,\nwhat is an obscure corner in such a submersion of joy? Cosette and\nMarius were passing through one of those egotistical and blessed\nmoments when no other faculty is left to a person than that of\nreceiving happiness. And then, an idea occurred to M.\nGillenormand.—“Pardieu, this armchair is empty. Come hither, Marius.\nYour aunt will permit it, although she has a right to you. This\narmchair is for you. That is legal and delightful. Fortunatus beside\nFortunata.”—Applause from the whole table. Marius took Jean Valjean’s\nplace beside Cosette, and things fell out so that Cosette, who had, at\nfirst, been saddened by Jean Valjean’s absence, ended by being\nsatisfied with it. From the moment when Marius took his place, and was\nthe substitute, Cosette would not have regretted God himself. She set\nher sweet little foot, shod in white satin, on Marius’ foot.\n\nThe armchair being occupied, M. Fauchelevent was obliterated; and\nnothing was lacking.\n\nAnd, five minutes afterward, the whole table from one end to the other,\nwas laughing with all the animation of forgetfulness.\n\nAt dessert, M. Gillenormand, rising to his feet, with a glass of\nchampagne in his hand—only half full so that the palsy of his eighty\nyears might not cause an overflow,—proposed the health of the married\npair.\n\n“You shall not escape two sermons,” he exclaimed. “This morning you had\none from the curé, this evening you shall have one from your\ngrandfather. Listen to me; I will give you a bit of advice: Adore each\nother. I do not make a pack of gyrations, I go straight to the mark, be\nhappy. In all creation, only the turtledoves are wise. Philosophers\nsay: ‘Moderate your joys.’ I say: ‘Give rein to your joys.’ Be as much\nsmitten with each other as fiends. Be in a rage about it. The\nphilosophers talk stuff and nonsense. I should like to stuff their\nphilosophy down their gullets again. Can there be too many perfumes,\ntoo many open rose-buds, too many nightingales singing, too many green\nleaves, too much aurora in life? can people love each other too much?\ncan people please each other too much? Take care, Estelle, thou art too\npretty! Have a care, Nemorin, thou art too handsome! Fine stupidity, in\nsooth! Can people enchant each other too much, cajole each other too\nmuch, charm each other too much? Can one be too much alive, too happy?\nModerate your joys. Ah, indeed! Down with the philosophers! Wisdom\nconsists in jubilation. Make merry, let us make merry. Are we happy\nbecause we are good, or are we good because we are happy? Is the Sancy\ndiamond called the Sancy because it belonged to Harley de Sancy, or\nbecause it weighs six hundred carats? I know nothing about it, life is\nfull of such problems; the important point is to possess the Sancy and\nhappiness. Let us be happy without quibbling and quirking. Let us obey\nthe sun blindly. What is the sun? It is love. He who says love, says\nwoman. Ah! ah! behold omnipotence—women. Ask that demagogue of a Marius\nif he is not the slave of that little tyrant of a Cosette. And of his\nown free will, too, the coward! Woman! There is no Robespierre who\nkeeps his place but woman reigns. I am no longer Royalist except\ntowards that royalty. What is Adam? The kingdom of Eve. No ’89 for Eve.\nThere has been the royal sceptre surmounted by a fleur-de-lys, there\nhas been the imperial sceptre surmounted by a globe, there has been the\nsceptre of Charlemagne, which was of iron, there has been the sceptre\nof Louis the Great, which was of gold,—the revolution twisted them\nbetween its thumb and forefinger, ha’penny straws; it is done with, it\nis broken, it lies on the earth, there is no longer any sceptre, but\nmake me a revolution against that little embroidered handkerchief,\nwhich smells of patchouli! I should like to see you do it. Try. Why is\nit so solid? Because it is a gewgaw. Ah! you are the nineteenth\ncentury? Well, what then? And we have been as foolish as you. Do not\nimagine that you have effected much change in the universe, because\nyour trip-gallant is called the cholera-morbus, and because your\n_pourrée_ is called the cachuca. In fact, the women must always be\nloved. I defy you to escape from that. These friends are our angels.\nYes, love, woman, the kiss forms a circle from which I defy you to\nescape; and, for my own part, I should be only too happy to re-enter\nit. Which of you has seen the planet Venus, the coquette of the abyss,\nthe Célimène of the ocean, rise in the infinite, calming all here\nbelow? The ocean is a rough Alcestis. Well, grumble as he will, when\nVenus appears he is forced to smile. That brute beast submits. We are\nall made so. Wrath, tempest, claps of thunder, foam to the very\nceiling. A woman enters on the scene, a planet rises; flat on your\nface! Marius was fighting six months ago; to-day he is married. That is\nwell. Yes, Marius, yes, Cosette, you are in the right. Exist boldly for\neach other, make us burst with rage that we cannot do the same,\nidealize each other, catch in your beaks all the tiny blades of\nfelicity that exist on earth, and arrange yourselves a nest for life.\nPardi, to love, to be loved, what a fine miracle when one is young!\nDon’t imagine that you have invented that. I, too, have had my dream,\nI, too, have meditated, I, too, have sighed; I, too, have had a\nmoonlight soul. Love is a child six thousand years old. Love has the\nright to a long white beard. Methusalem is a street arab beside Cupid.\nFor sixty centuries men and women have got out of their scrape by\nloving. The devil, who is cunning, took to hating man; man, who is\nstill more cunning, took to loving woman. In this way he does more good\nthan the devil does him harm. This craft was discovered in the days of\nthe terrestrial paradise. The invention is old, my friends, but it is\nperfectly new. Profit by it. Be Daphnis and Chloe, while waiting to\nbecome Philemon and Baucis. Manage so that, when you are with each\nother, nothing shall be lacking to you, and that Cosette may be the sun\nfor Marius, and that Marius may be the universe to Cosette. Cosette,\nlet your fine weather be the smile of your husband; Marius, let your\nrain be your wife’s tears. And let it never rain in your household. You\nhave filched the winning number in the lottery; you have gained the\ngreat prize, guard it well, keep it under lock and key, do not squander\nit, adore each other and snap your fingers at all the rest. Believe\nwhat I say to you. It is good sense. And good sense cannot lie. Be a\nreligion to each other. Each man has his own fashion of adoring God.\nSaperlotte! the best way to adore God is to love one’s wife. _I love\nthee!_ that’s my catechism. He who loves is orthodox. The oath of Henri\nIV. places sanctity somewhere between feasting and drunkenness.\nVentre-saint-gris! I don’t belong to the religion of that oath. Woman\nis forgotten in it. This astonishes me on the part of Henri IV. My\nfriends, long live women! I am old, they say; it’s astonishing how much\nI feel in the mood to be young. I should like to go and listen to the\nbagpipes in the woods. Children who contrive to be beautiful and\ncontented,—that intoxicates me. I would like greatly to get married, if\nany one would have me. It is impossible to imagine that God could have\nmade us for anything but this: to idolize, to coo, to preen ourselves,\nto be dove-like, to be dainty, to bill and coo our loves from morn to\nnight, to gaze at one’s image in one’s little wife, to be proud, to be\ntriumphant, to plume oneself; that is the aim of life. There, let not\nthat displease you which we used to think in our day, when we were\nyoung folks. Ah! vertu-bamboche! what charming women there were in\nthose days, and what pretty little faces and what lovely lasses! I\ncommitted my ravages among them. Then love each other. If people did\nnot love each other, I really do not see what use there would be in\nhaving any springtime; and for my own part, I should pray the good God\nto shut up all the beautiful things that he shows us, and to take away\nfrom us and put back in his box, the flowers, the birds, and the pretty\nmaidens. My children, receive an old man’s blessing.”\n\n\nThe evening was gay, lively and agreeable. The grandfather’s sovereign\ngood humor gave the key-note to the whole feast, and each person\nregulated his conduct on that almost centenarian cordiality. They\ndanced a little, they laughed a great deal; it was an amiable wedding.\nGoodman Days of Yore might have been invited to it. However, he was\npresent in the person of Father Gillenormand.\n\nThere was a tumult, then silence.\n\nThe married pair disappeared.\n\nA little after midnight, the Gillenormand house became a temple.\n\nHere we pause. On the threshold of wedding nights stands a smiling\nangel with his finger on his lips.\n\nThe soul enters into contemplation before that sanctuary where the\ncelebration of love takes place.\n\nThere should be flashes of light athwart such houses. The joy which\nthey contain ought to make its escape through the stones of the walls\nin brilliancy, and vaguely illuminate the gloom. It is impossible that\nthis sacred and fatal festival should not give off a celestial radiance\nto the infinite. Love is the sublime crucible wherein the fusion of the\nman and the woman takes place; the being one, the being triple, the\nbeing final, the human trinity proceeds from it. This birth of two\nsouls into one, ought to be an emotion for the gloom. The lover is the\npriest; the ravished virgin is terrified. Something of that joy ascends\nto God. Where true marriage is, that is to say, where there is love,\nthe ideal enters in. A nuptial bed makes a nook of dawn amid the\nshadows. If it were given to the eye of the flesh to scan the\nformidable and charming visions of the upper life, it is probable that\nwe should behold the forms of night, the winged unknowns, the blue\npassers of the invisible, bend down, a throng of sombre heads, around\nthe luminous house, satisfied, showering benedictions, pointing out to\neach other the virgin wife gently alarmed, sweetly terrified, and\nbearing the reflection of human bliss upon their divine countenances.\nIf at that supreme hour, the wedded pair, dazzled with voluptuousness\nand believing themselves alone, were to listen, they would hear in\ntheir chamber a confused rustling of wings. Perfect happiness implies a\nmutual understanding with the angels. That dark little chamber has all\nheaven for its ceiling. When two mouths, rendered sacred by love,\napproach to create, it is impossible that there should not be, above\nthat ineffable kiss, a quivering throughout the immense mystery of\nstars.\n\nThese felicities are the true ones. There is no joy outside of these\njoys. Love is the only ecstasy. All the rest weeps.\n\nTo love, or to have loved,—this suffices. Demand nothing more. There is\nno other pearl to be found in the shadowy folds of life. To love is a\nfulfilment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—THE INSEPARABLE\n\n\nWhat had become of Jean Valjean?\n\nImmediately after having laughed, at Cosette’s graceful command, when\nno one was paying any heed to him, Jean Valjean had risen and had\ngained the antechamber unperceived. This was the very room which, eight\nmonths before, he had entered black with mud, with blood and powder,\nbringing back the grandson to the grandfather. The old wainscoting was\ngarlanded with foliage and flowers; the musicians were seated on the\nsofa on which they had laid Marius down. Basque, in a black coat,\nknee-breeches, white stockings and white gloves, was arranging roses\nround all of the dishes that were to be served. Jean Valjean pointed to\nhis arm in its sling, charged Basque to explain his absence, and went\naway.\n\nThe long windows of the dining-room opened on the street. Jean Valjean\nstood for several minutes, erect and motionless in the darkness,\nbeneath those radiant windows. He listened. The confused sounds of the\nbanquet reached his ear. He heard the loud, commanding tones of the\ngrandfather, the violins, the clatter of the plates, the bursts of\nlaughter, and through all that merry uproar, he distinguished Cosette’s\nsweet and joyous voice.\n\nHe quitted the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, and returned to the Rue de\nl’Homme Armé.\n\nIn order to return thither, he took the Rue Saint-Louis, the Rue\nCulture-Sainte-Catherine, and the Blancs-Manteaux; it was a little\nlonger, but it was the road through which, for the last three months,\nhe had become accustomed to pass every day on his way from the Rue de\nl’Homme Armé to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, in order to avoid the\nobstructions and the mud in the Rue Vieille-du-Temple.\n\nThis road, through which Cosette had passed, excluded for him all\npossibility of any other itinerary.\n\nJean Valjean entered his lodgings. He lighted his candle and mounted\nthe stairs. The apartment was empty. Even Toussaint was no longer\nthere. Jean Valjean’s step made more noise than usual in the chambers.\nAll the cupboards stood open. He penetrated to Cosette’s bedroom. There\nwere no sheets on the bed. The pillow, covered with ticking, and\nwithout a case or lace, was laid on the blankets folded up on the foot\nof the mattress, whose covering was visible, and on which no one was\never to sleep again. All the little feminine objects which Cosette was\nattached to had been carried away; nothing remained except the heavy\nfurniture and the four walls. Toussaint’s bed was despoiled in like\nmanner. One bed only was made up, and seemed to be waiting some one,\nand this was Jean Valjean’s bed.\n\nJean Valjean looked at the walls, closed some of the cupboard doors,\nand went and came from one room to another.\n\nThen he sought his own chamber once more, and set his candle on a\ntable.\n\nHe had disengaged his arm from the sling, and he used his right hand as\nthough it did not hurt him.\n\nHe approached his bed, and his eyes rested, was it by chance? was it\nintentionally? on the _inseparable_ of which Cosette had been jealous,\non the little portmanteau which never left him. On his arrival in the\nRue de l’Homme Armé, on the 4th of June, he had deposited it on a round\ntable near the head of his bed. He went to this table with a sort of\nvivacity, took a key from his pocket, and opened the valise.\n\nFrom it he slowly drew forth the garments in which, ten years before,\nCosette had quitted Montfermeil; first the little gown, then the black\nfichu, then the stout, coarse child’s shoes which Cosette might almost\nhave worn still, so tiny were her feet, then the fustian bodice, which\nwas very thick, then the knitted petticoat, next the apron with\npockets, then the woollen stockings. These stockings, which still\npreserved the graceful form of a tiny leg, were no longer than Jean\nValjean’s hand. All this was black of hue. It was he who had brought\nthose garments to Montfermeil for her. As he removed them from the\nvalise, he laid them on the bed. He fell to thinking. He called up\nmemories. It was in winter, in a very cold month of December, she was\nshivering, half-naked, in rags, her poor little feet were all red in\ntheir wooden shoes. He, Jean Valjean, had made her abandon those rags\nto clothe herself in these mourning habiliments. The mother must have\nfelt pleased in her grave, to see her daughter wearing mourning for\nher, and, above all, to see that she was properly clothed, and that she\nwas warm. He thought of that forest of Montfermeil; they had traversed\nit together, Cosette and he; he thought of what the weather had been,\nof the leafless trees, of the wood destitute of birds, of the sunless\nsky; it mattered not, it was charming. He arranged the tiny garments on\nthe bed, the fichu next to the petticoat, the stockings beside the\nshoes, and he looked at them, one after the other. She was no taller\nthan that, she had her big doll in her arms, she had put her louis d’or\nin the pocket of that apron, she had laughed, they walked hand in hand,\nshe had no one in the world but him.\n\nThen his venerable, white head fell forward on the bed, that stoical\nold heart broke, his face was engulfed, so to speak, in Cosette’s\ngarments, and if any one had passed up the stairs at that moment, he\nwould have heard frightful sobs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—THE IMMORTAL LIVER 68\n\n\nThe old and formidable struggle, of which we have already witnessed so\nmany phases, began once more.\n\nJacob struggled with the angel but one night. Alas! how many times have\nwe beheld Jean Valjean seized bodily by his conscience, in the\ndarkness, and struggling desperately against it!\n\nUnheard-of conflict! At certain moments the foot slips; at other\nmoments the ground crumbles away underfoot. How many times had that\nconscience, mad for the good, clasped and overthrown him! How many\ntimes had the truth set her knee inexorably upon his breast! How many\ntimes, hurled to earth by the light, had he begged for mercy! How many\ntimes had that implacable spark, lighted within him, and upon him by\nthe Bishop, dazzled him by force when he had wished to be blind! How\nmany times had he risen to his feet in the combat, held fast to the\nrock, leaning against sophism, dragged in the dust, now getting the\nupper hand of his conscience, again overthrown by it! How many times,\nafter an equivoque, after the specious and treacherous reasoning of\negotism, had he heard his irritated conscience cry in his ear: “A trip!\nyou wretch!” How many times had his refractory thoughts rattled\nconvulsively in his throat, under the evidence of duty! Resistance to\nGod. Funereal sweats. What secret wounds which he alone felt bleed!\nWhat excoriations in his lamentable existence! How many times he had\nrisen bleeding, bruised, broken, enlightened, despair in his heart,\nserenity in his soul! and, vanquished, he had felt himself the\nconqueror. And, after having dislocated, broken, and rent his\nconscience with red-hot pincers, it had said to him, as it stood over\nhim, formidable, luminous, and tranquil: “Now, go in peace!”\n\n\nBut on emerging from so melancholy a conflict, what a lugubrious peace,\nalas!\n\nNevertheless, that night Jean Valjean felt that he was passing through\nhis final combat.\n\nA heart-rending question presented itself.\n\nPredestinations are not all direct; they do not open out in a straight\navenue before the predestined man; they have blind courts, impassable\nalleys, obscure turns, disturbing crossroads offering the choice of\nmany ways. Jean Valjean had halted at that moment at the most perilous\nof these crossroads.\n\nHe had come to the supreme crossing of good and evil. He had that\ngloomy intersection beneath his eyes. On this occasion once more, as\nhad happened to him already in other sad vicissitudes, two roads opened\nout before him, the one tempting, the other alarming.\n\nWhich was he to take?\n\nHe was counselled to the one which alarmed him by that mysterious index\nfinger which we all perceive whenever we fix our eyes on the darkness.\n\nOnce more, Jean Valjean had the choice between the terrible port and\nthe smiling ambush.\n\nIs it then true? the soul may recover; but not fate. Frightful thing!\nan incurable destiny!\n\nThis is the problem which presented itself to him:\n\nIn what manner was Jean Valjean to behave in relation to the happiness\nof Cosette and Marius? It was he who had willed that happiness, it was\nhe who had brought it about; he had, himself, buried it in his\nentrails, and at that moment, when he reflected on it, he was able to\nenjoy the sort of satisfaction which an armorer would experience on\nrecognizing his factory mark on a knife, on withdrawing it, all\nsmoking, from his own breast.\n\nCosette had Marius, Marius possessed Cosette. They had everything, even\nriches. And this was his doing.\n\nBut what was he, Jean Valjean, to do with this happiness, now that it\nexisted, now that it was there? Should he force himself on this\nhappiness? Should he treat it as belonging to him? No doubt, Cosette\ndid belong to another; but should he, Jean Valjean, retain of Cosette\nall that he could retain? Should he remain the sort of father, half\nseen but respected, which he had hitherto been? Should he, without\nsaying a word, bring his past to that future? Should he present himself\nthere, as though he had a right, and should he seat himself, veiled, at\nthat luminous fireside? Should he take those innocent hands into his\ntragic hands, with a smile? Should he place upon the peaceful fender of\nthe Gillenormand drawing-room those feet of his, which dragged behind\nthem the disgraceful shadow of the law? Should he enter into\nparticipation in the fair fortunes of Cosette and Marius? Should he\nrender the obscurity on his brow and the cloud upon theirs still more\ndense? Should he place his catastrophe as a third associate in their\nfelicity? Should he continue to hold his peace? In a word, should he be\nthe sinister mute of destiny beside these two happy beings?\n\nWe must have become habituated to fatality and to encounters with it,\nin order to have the daring to raise our eyes when certain questions\nappear to us in all their horrible nakedness. Good or evil stands\nbehind this severe interrogation point. What are you going to do?\ndemands the sphinx.\n\nThis habit of trial Jean Valjean possessed. He gazed intently at the\nsphinx.\n\nHe examined the pitiless problem under all its aspects.\n\nCosette, that charming existence, was the raft of this shipwreck. What\nwas he to do? To cling fast to it, or to let go his hold?\n\nIf he clung to it, he should emerge from disaster, he should ascend\nagain into the sunlight, he should let the bitter water drip from his\ngarments and his hair, he was saved, he should live.\n\nAnd if he let go his hold?\n\nThen the abyss.\n\nThus he took sad council with his thoughts. Or, to speak more\ncorrectly, he fought; he kicked furiously internally, now against his\nwill, now against his conviction.\n\nHappily for Jean Valjean that he had been able to weep. That relieved\nhim, possibly. But the beginning was savage. A tempest, more furious\nthan the one which had formerly driven him to Arras, broke loose within\nhim. The past surged up before him facing the present; he compared them\nand sobbed. The silence of tears once opened, the despairing man\nwrithed.\n\nHe felt that he had been stopped short.\n\nAlas! in this fight to the death between our egotism and our duty, when\nwe thus retreat step by step before our immutable ideal, bewildered,\nfurious, exasperated at having to yield, disputing the ground, hoping\nfor a possible flight, seeking an escape, what an abrupt and sinister\nresistance does the foot of the wall offer in our rear!\n\nTo feel the sacred shadow which forms an obstacle!\n\nThe invisible inexorable, what an obsession!\n\nThen, one is never done with conscience. Make your choice, Brutus; make\nyour choice, Cato. It is fathomless, since it is God. One flings into\nthat well the labor of one’s whole life, one flings in one’s fortune,\none flings in one’s riches, one flings in one’s success, one flings in\none’s liberty or fatherland, one flings in one’s well-being, one flings\nin one’s repose, one flings in one’s joy! More! more! more! Empty the\nvase! tip the urn! One must finish by flinging in one’s heart.\n\nSomewhere in the fog of the ancient hells, there is a tun like that.\n\nIs not one pardonable, if one at last refuses! Can the inexhaustible\nhave any right? Are not chains which are endless above human strength?\nWho would blame Sisyphus and Jean Valjean for saying: “It is enough!”\n\n\nThe obedience of matter is limited by friction; is there no limit to\nthe obedience of the soul? If perpetual motion is impossible, can\nperpetual self-sacrifice be exacted?\n\nThe first step is nothing, it is the last which is difficult. What was\nthe Champmathieu affair in comparison with Cosette’s marriage and of\nthat which it entailed? What is a re-entrance into the galleys,\ncompared to entrance into the void?\n\nOh, first step that must be descended, how sombre art thou! Oh, second\nstep, how black art thou!\n\nHow could he refrain from turning aside his head this time?\n\nMartyrdom is sublimation, corrosive sublimation. It is a torture which\nconsecrates. One can consent to it for the first hour; one seats\noneself on the throne of glowing iron, one places on one’s head the\ncrown of hot iron, one accepts the globe of red hot iron, one takes the\nsceptre of red hot iron, but the mantle of flame still remains to be\ndonned, and comes there not a moment when the miserable flesh revolts\nand when one abdicates from suffering?\n\nAt length, Jean Valjean entered into the peace of exhaustion.\n\nHe weighed, he reflected, he considered the alternatives, the\nmysterious balance of light and darkness.\n\nShould he impose his galleys on those two dazzling children, or should\nhe consummate his irremediable engulfment by himself? On one side lay\nthe sacrifice of Cosette, on the other that of himself.\n\nAt what solution should he arrive? What decision did he come to?\n\nWhat resolution did he take? What was his own inward definitive\nresponse to the unbribable interrogatory of fatality? What door did he\ndecide to open? Which side of his life did he resolve upon closing and\ncondemning? Among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him,\nwhich was his choice? What extremity did he accept? To which of the\ngulfs did he nod his head?\n\nHis dizzy reverie lasted all night long.\n\nHe remained there until daylight, in the same attitude, bent double\nover that bed, prostrate beneath the enormity of fate, crushed,\nperchance, alas! with clenched fists, with arms outspread at right\nangles, like a man crucified who has been un-nailed, and flung face\ndown on the earth. There he remained for twelve hours, the twelve long\nhours of a long winter’s night, ice-cold, without once raising his\nhead, and without uttering a word. He was as motionless as a corpse,\nwhile his thoughts wallowed on the earth and soared, now like the\nhydra, now like the eagle. Any one to behold him thus motionless would\nhave pronounced him dead; all at once he shuddered convulsively, and\nhis mouth, glued to Cosette’s garments, kissed them; then it could be\nseen that he was alive.\n\nWho could see? Since Jean Valjean was alone, and there was no one\nthere.\n\nThe One who is in the shadows.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SEVENTH—THE LAST DRAUGHT FROM THE CUP\n\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nLast Drop from the Cup  5b7-1-last-drop\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE SEVENTH CIRCLE AND THE EIGHTH HEAVEN\n\n\nThe days that follow weddings are solitary. People respect the\nmeditations of the happy pair. And also, their tardy slumbers, to some\ndegree. The tumult of visits and congratulations only begins later on.\nOn the morning of the 17th of February, it was a little past midday\nwhen Basque, with napkin and feather-duster under his arm, busy in\nsetting his antechamber to rights, heard a light tap at the door. There\nhad been no ring, which was discreet on such a day. Basque opened the\ndoor, and beheld M. Fauchelevent. He introduced him into the\ndrawing-room, still encumbered and topsy-turvy, and which bore the air\nof a field of battle after the joys of the preceding evening.\n\n“_Dame_, sir,” remarked Basque, “we all woke up late.”\n\n\n“Is your master up?” asked Jean Valjean.\n\n“How is Monsieur’s arm?” replied Basque.\n\n“Better. Is your master up?”\n\n\n“Which one? the old one or the new one?”\n\n\n“Monsieur Pontmercy.”\n\n\n“Monsieur le Baron,” said Basque, drawing himself up.\n\nA man is a Baron most of all to his servants. He counts for something\nwith them; they are what a philosopher would call, bespattered with the\ntitle, and that flatters them. Marius, be it said in passing, a\nmilitant republican as he had proved, was now a Baron in spite of\nhimself. A small revolution had taken place in the family in connection\nwith this title. It was now M. Gillenormand who clung to it, and Marius\nwho detached himself from it. But Colonel Pontmercy had written: “My\nson will bear my title.” Marius obeyed. And then, Cosette, in whom the\nwoman was beginning to dawn, was delighted to be a Baroness.\n\n“Monsieur le Baron?” repeated Basque. “I will go and see. I will tell\nhim that M. Fauchelevent is here.”\n\n\n“No. Do not tell him that it is I. Tell him that some one wishes to\nspeak to him in private, and mention no name.”\n\n\n“Ah!” ejaculated Basque.\n\n“I wish to surprise him.”\n\n\n“Ah!” ejaculated Basque once more, emitting his second “ah!” as an\nexplanation of the first.\n\nAnd he left the room.\n\nJean Valjean remained alone.\n\nThe drawing-room, as we have just said, was in great disorder. It\nseemed as though, by lending an ear, one might still hear the vague\nnoise of the wedding. On the polished floor lay all sorts of flowers\nwhich had fallen from garlands and head-dresses. The wax candles,\nburned to stumps, added stalactites of wax to the crystal drops of the\nchandeliers. Not a single piece of furniture was in its place. In the\ncorners, three or four armchairs, drawn close together in a circle, had\nthe appearance of continuing a conversation. The whole effect was\ncheerful. A certain grace still lingers round a dead feast. It has been\na happy thing. On the chairs in disarray, among those fading flowers,\nbeneath those extinct lights, people have thought of joy. The sun had\nsucceeded to the chandelier, and made its way gayly into the\ndrawing-room.\n\nSeveral minutes elapsed. Jean Valjean stood motionless on the spot\nwhere Basque had left him. He was very pale. His eyes were hollow, and\nso sunken in his head by sleeplessness that they nearly disappeared in\ntheir orbits. His black coat bore the weary folds of a garment that has\nbeen up all night. The elbows were whitened with the down which the\nfriction of cloth against linen leaves behind it.\n\nJean Valjean stared at the window outlined on the polished floor at his\nfeet by the sun.\n\nThere came a sound at the door, and he raised his eyes.\n\nMarius entered, his head well up, his mouth smiling, an indescribable\nlight on his countenance, his brow expanded, his eyes triumphant. He\nhad not slept either.\n\n“It is you, father!” he exclaimed, on catching sight of Jean Valjean;\n“that idiot of a Basque had such a mysterious air! But you have come\ntoo early. It is only half past twelve. Cosette is asleep.”\n\n\nThat word: “Father,” said to M. Fauchelevent by Marius, signified:\nsupreme felicity. There had always existed, as the reader knows, a\nlofty wall, a coldness and a constraint between them; ice which must be\nbroken or melted. Marius had reached that point of intoxication when\nthe wall was lowered, when the ice dissolved, and when M. Fauchelevent\nwas to him, as to Cosette, a father.\n\nHe continued: his words poured forth, as is the peculiarity of divine\nparoxysms of joy.\n\n“How glad I am to see you! If you only knew how we missed you\nyesterday! Good morning, father. How is your hand? Better, is it not?”\n\n\nAnd, satisfied with the favorable reply which he had made to himself,\nhe pursued:\n\n“We have both been talking about you. Cosette loves you so dearly! You\nmust not forget that you have a chamber here, We want nothing more to\ndo with the Rue de l’Homme Armé. We will have no more of it at all. How\ncould you go to live in a street like that, which is sickly, which is\ndisagreeable, which is ugly, which has a barrier at one end, where one\nis cold, and into which one cannot enter? You are to come and install\nyourself here. And this very day. Or you will have to deal with\nCosette. She means to lead us all by the nose, I warn you. You have\nyour own chamber here, it is close to ours, it opens on the garden; the\ntrouble with the clock has been attended to, the bed is made, it is all\nready, you have only to take possession of it. Near your bed Cosette\nhas placed a huge, old, easy-chair covered with Utrecht velvet and she\nhas said to it: ‘Stretch out your arms to him.’ A nightingale comes to\nthe clump of acacias opposite your windows, every spring. In two months\nmore you will have it. You will have its nest on your left and ours on\nyour right. By night it will sing, and by day Cosette will prattle.\nYour chamber faces due South. Cosette will arrange your books for you,\nyour Voyages of Captain Cook and the other,—Vancouver’s and all your\naffairs. I believe that there is a little valise to which you are\nattached, I have fixed upon a corner of honor for that. You have\nconquered my grandfather, you suit him. We will live together. Do you\nplay whist? you will overwhelm my grandfather with delight if you play\nwhist. It is you who shall take Cosette to walk on the days when I am\nat the courts, you shall give her your arm, you know, as you used to,\nin the Luxembourg. We are absolutely resolved to be happy. And you\nshall be included in it, in our happiness, do you hear, father? Come,\nwill you breakfast with us to-day?”\n\n\n“Sir,” said Jean Valjean, “I have something to say to you. I am an\nex-convict.”\n\n\nThe limit of shrill sounds perceptible can be overleaped, as well in\nthe case of the mind as in that of the ear. These words: “I am an\nex-convict,” proceeding from the mouth of M. Fauchelevent and entering\nthe ear of Marius overshot the possible. It seemed to him that\nsomething had just been said to him; but he did not know what. He stood\nwith his mouth wide open.\n\nThen he perceived that the man who was addressing him was frightful.\nWholly absorbed in his own dazzled state, he had not, up to that\nmoment, observed the other man’s terrible pallor.\n\nJean Valjean untied the black cravat which supported his right arm,\nunrolled the linen from around his hand, bared his thumb and showed it\nto Marius.\n\n“There is nothing the matter with my hand,” said he.\n\nMarius looked at the thumb.\n\n“There has not been anything the matter with it,” went on Jean Valjean.\n\nThere was, in fact, no trace of any injury.\n\nJean Valjean continued:\n\n“It was fitting that I should be absent from your marriage. I absented\nmyself as much as was in my power. So I invented this injury in order\nthat I might not commit a forgery, that I might not introduce a flaw\ninto the marriage documents, in order that I might escape from\nsigning.”\n\n\nMarius stammered.\n\n“What is the meaning of this?”\n\n\n“The meaning of it is,” replied Jean Valjean, “that I have been in the\ngalleys.”\n\n\n“You are driving me mad!” exclaimed Marius in terror.\n\n“Monsieur Pontmercy,” said Jean Valjean, “I was nineteen years in the\ngalleys. For theft. Then, I was condemned for life for theft, for a\nsecond offence. At the present moment, I have broken my ban.”\n\n\nIn vain did Marius recoil before the reality, refuse the fact, resist\nthe evidence, he was forced to give way. He began to understand, and,\nas always happens in such cases, he understood too much. An inward\nshudder of hideous enlightenment flashed through him; an idea which\nmade him quiver traversed his mind. He caught a glimpse of a wretched\ndestiny for himself in the future.\n\n“Say all, say all!” he cried. “You are Cosette’s father!”\n\n\nAnd he retreated a couple of paces with a movement of indescribable\nhorror.\n\nJean Valjean elevated his head with so much majesty of attitude that he\nseemed to grow even to the ceiling.\n\n“It is necessary that you should believe me here, sir; although our\noath to others may not be received in law . . .”\n\n\nHere he paused, then, with a sort of sovereign and sepulchral\nauthority, he added, articulating slowly, and emphasizing the\nsyllables:\n\n“. . . You will believe me. I the father of Cosette! before God, no.\nMonsieur le Baron Pontmercy, I am a peasant of Faverolles. I earned my\nliving by pruning trees. My name is not Fauchelevent, but Jean Valjean.\nI am not related to Cosette. Reassure yourself.”\n\n\nMarius stammered:\n\n“Who will prove that to me?”\n\n\n“I. Since I tell you so.”\n\n\nMarius looked at the man. He was melancholy yet tranquil. No lie could\nproceed from such a calm. That which is icy is sincere. The truth could\nbe felt in that chill of the tomb.\n\n“I believe you,” said Marius.\n\nJean Valjean bent his head, as though taking note of this, and\ncontinued:\n\n“What am I to Cosette? A passer-by. Ten years ago, I did not know that\nshe was in existence. I love her, it is true. One loves a child whom\none has seen when very young, being old oneself. When one is old, one\nfeels oneself a grandfather towards all little children. You may, it\nseems to me, suppose that I have something which resembles a heart. She\nwas an orphan. Without either father or mother. She needed me. That is\nwhy I began to love her. Children are so weak that the first comer,\neven a man like me, can become their protector. I have fulfilled this\nduty towards Cosette. I do not think that so slight a thing can be\ncalled a good action; but if it be a good action, well, say that I have\ndone it. Register this attenuating circumstance. To-day, Cosette passes\nout of my life; our two roads part. Henceforth, I can do nothing for\nher. She is Madame Pontmercy. Her providence has changed. And Cosette\ngains by the change. All is well. As for the six hundred thousand\nfrancs, you do not mention them to me, but I forestall your thought,\nthey are a deposit. How did that deposit come into my hands? What does\nthat matter? I restore the deposit. Nothing more can be demanded of me.\nI complete the restitution by announcing my true name. That concerns\nme. I have a reason for desiring that you should know who I am.”\n\n\nAnd Jean Valjean looked Marius full in the face.\n\nAll that Marius experienced was tumultuous and incoherent. Certain\ngusts of destiny produce these billows in our souls.\n\nWe have all undergone moments of trouble in which everything within us\nis dispersed; we say the first things that occur to us, which are not\nalways precisely those which should be said. There are sudden\nrevelations which one cannot bear, and which intoxicate like baleful\nwine. Marius was stupefied by the novel situation which presented\nitself to him, to the point of addressing that man almost like a person\nwho was angry with him for this avowal.\n\n“But why,” he exclaimed, “do you tell me all this? Who forces you to do\nso? You could have kept your secret to yourself. You are neither\ndenounced, nor tracked nor pursued. You have a reason for wantonly\nmaking such a revelation. Conclude. There is something more. In what\nconnection do you make this confession? What is your motive?”\n\n\n“My motive?” replied Jean Valjean in a voice so low and dull that one\nwould have said that he was talking to himself rather than to Marius.\n“From what motive, in fact, has this convict just said ‘I am a\nconvict’? Well, yes! the motive is strange. It is out of honesty. Stay,\nthe unfortunate point is that I have a thread in my heart, which keeps\nme fast. It is when one is old that that sort of thread is particularly\nsolid. All life falls in ruin around one; one resists. Had I been able\nto tear out that thread, to break it, to undo the knot or to cut it, to\ngo far away, I should have been safe. I had only to go away; there are\ndiligences in the Rue Bouloy; you are happy; I am going. I have tried\nto break that thread, I have jerked at it, it would not break, I tore\nmy heart with it. Then I said: ‘I cannot live anywhere else than here.’\nI must stay. Well, yes, you are right, I am a fool, why not simply\nremain here? You offer me a chamber in this house, Madame Pontmercy is\nsincerely attached to me, she said to the armchair: ‘Stretch out your\narms to him,’ your grandfather demands nothing better than to have me,\nI suit him, we shall live together, and take our meals in common, I\nshall give Cosette my arm . . . Madame Pontmercy, excuse me, it is a\nhabit, we shall have but one roof, one table, one fire, the same\nchimney-corner in winter, the same promenade in summer, that is joy,\nthat is happiness, that is everything. We shall live as one family. One\nfamily!”\n\n\nAt that word, Jean Valjean became wild. He folded his arms, glared at\nthe floor beneath his feet as though he would have excavated an abyss\ntherein, and his voice suddenly rose in thundering tones:\n\n“As one family! No. I belong to no family. I do not belong to yours. I\ndo not belong to any family of men. In houses where people are among\nthemselves, I am superfluous. There are families, but there is nothing\nof the sort for me. I am an unlucky wretch; I am left outside. Did I\nhave a father and mother? I almost doubt it. On the day when I gave\nthat child in marriage, all came to an end. I have seen her happy, and\nthat she is with a man whom she loves, and that there exists here a\nkind old man, a household of two angels, and all joys in that house,\nand that it was well, I said to myself: ‘Enter thou not.’ I could have\nlied, it is true, have deceived you all, and remained Monsieur\nFauchelevent. So long as it was for her, I could lie; but now it would\nbe for myself, and I must not. It was sufficient for me to hold my\npeace, it is true, and all would go on. You ask me what has forced me\nto speak? a very odd thing; my conscience. To hold my peace was very\neasy, however. I passed the night in trying to persuade myself to it;\nyou questioned me, and what I have just said to you is so extraordinary\nthat you have the right to do it; well, yes, I have passed the night in\nalleging reasons to myself, and I gave myself very good reasons, I have\ndone what I could. But there are two things in which I have not\nsucceeded; in breaking the thread that holds me fixed, riveted and\nsealed here by the heart, or in silencing some one who speaks softly to\nme when I am alone. That is why I have come hither to tell you\neverything this morning. Everything or nearly everything. It is useless\nto tell you that which concerns only myself; I keep that to myself. You\nknow the essential points. So I have taken my mystery and have brought\nit to you. And I have disembowelled my secret before your eyes. It was\nnot a resolution that was easy to take. I struggled all night long. Ah!\nyou think that I did not tell myself that this was no Champmathieu\naffair, that by concealing my name I was doing no one any injury, that\nthe name of Fauchelevent had been given to me by Fauchelevent himself,\nout of gratitude for a service rendered to him, and that I might\nassuredly keep it, and that I should be happy in that chamber which you\noffer me, that I should not be in any one’s way, that I should be in my\nown little corner, and that, while you would have Cosette, I should\nhave the idea that I was in the same house with her. Each one of us\nwould have had his share of happiness. If I continued to be Monsieur\nFauchelevent, that would arrange everything. Yes, with the exception of\nmy soul. There was joy everywhere upon my surface, but the bottom of my\nsoul remained black. It is not enough to be happy, one must be content.\nThus I should have remained Monsieur Fauchelevent, thus I should have\nconcealed my true visage, thus, in the presence of your expansion, I\nshould have had an enigma, thus, in the midst of your full noonday, I\nshould have had shadows, thus, without crying ‘’ware,’ I should have\nsimply introduced the galleys to your fireside, I should have taken my\nseat at your table with the thought that if you knew who I was, you\nwould drive me from it, I should have allowed myself to be served by\ndomestics who, had they known, would have said: ‘How horrible!’ I\nshould have touched you with my elbow, which you have a right to\ndislike, I should have filched your clasps of the hand! There would\nhave existed in your house a division of respect between venerable\nwhite locks and tainted white locks; at your most intimate hours, when\nall hearts thought themselves open to the very bottom to all the rest,\nwhen we four were together, your grandfather, you two and myself, a\nstranger would have been present! I should have been side by side with\nyou in your existence, having for my only care not to disarrange the\ncover of my dreadful pit. Thus, I, a dead man, should have thrust\nmyself upon you who are living beings. I should have condemned her to\nmyself forever. You and Cosette and I would have had all three of our\nheads in the green cap! Does it not make you shudder? I am only the\nmost crushed of men; I should have been the most monstrous of men. And\nI should have committed that crime every day! And I should have had\nthat face of night upon my visage every day! every day! And I should\nhave communicated to you a share in my taint every day! every day! to\nyou, my dearly beloved, my children, to you, my innocent creatures! Is\nit nothing to hold one’s peace? is it a simple matter to keep silence?\nNo, it is not simple. There is a silence which lies. And my lie, and my\nfraud and my indignity, and my cowardice and my treason and my crime, I\nshould have drained drop by drop, I should have spit it out, then\nswallowed it again, I should have finished at midnight and have begun\nagain at midday, and my ‘good morning’ would have lied, and my ‘good\nnight’ would have lied, and I should have slept on it, I should have\neaten it, with my bread, and I should have looked Cosette in the face,\nand I should have responded to the smile of the angel by the smile of\nthe damned soul, and I should have been an abominable villain! Why\nshould I do it? in order to be happy. In order to be happy. Have I the\nright to be happy? I stand outside of life, sir.”\n\n\nJean Valjean paused. Marius listened. Such chains of ideas and of\nanguishes cannot be interrupted. Jean Valjean lowered his voice once\nmore, but it was no longer a dull voice—it was a sinister voice.\n\n“You ask why I speak? I am neither denounced, nor pursued, nor tracked,\nyou say. Yes! I am denounced! yes! I am tracked! By whom? By myself. It\nis I who bar the passage to myself, and I drag myself, and I push\nmyself, and I arrest myself, and I execute myself, and when one holds\noneself, one is firmly held.”\n\n\nAnd, seizing a handful of his own coat by the nape of the neck and\nextending it towards Marius:\n\n“Do you see that fist?” he continued. “Don’t you think that it holds\nthat collar in such a wise as not to release it? Well! conscience is\nanother grasp! If one desires to be happy, sir, one must never\nunderstand duty; for, as soon as one has comprehended it, it is\nimplacable. One would say that it punished you for comprehending it;\nbut no, it rewards you; for it places you in a hell, where you feel God\nbeside you. One has no sooner lacerated his own entrails than he is at\npeace with himself.”\n\n\nAnd, with a poignant accent, he added:\n\n“Monsieur Pontmercy, this is not common sense, I am an honest man. It\nis by degrading myself in your eyes that I elevate myself in my own.\nThis has happened to me once before, but it was less painful then; it\nwas a mere nothing. Yes, an honest man. I should not be so if, through\nmy fault, you had continued to esteem me; now that you despise me, I am\nso. I have that fatality hanging over me that, not being able to ever\nhave anything but stolen consideration, that consideration humiliates\nme, and crushes me inwardly, and, in order that I may respect myself,\nit is necessary that I should be despised. Then I straighten up again.\nI am a galley-slave who obeys his conscience. I know well that that is\nmost improbable. But what would you have me do about it? it is the\nfact. I have entered into engagements with myself; I keep them. There\nare encounters which bind us, there are chances which involve us in\nduties. You see, Monsieur Pontmercy, various things have happened to me\nin the course of my life.”\n\n\nAgain Jean Valjean paused, swallowing his saliva with an effort, as\nthough his words had a bitter after-taste, and then he went on:\n\n“When one has such a horror hanging over one, one has not the right to\nmake others share it without their knowledge, one has not the right to\nmake them slip over one’s own precipice without their perceiving it,\none has not the right to let one’s red blouse drag upon them, one has\nno right to slyly encumber with one’s misery the happiness of others.\nIt is hideous to approach those who are healthy, and to touch them in\nthe dark with one’s ulcer. In spite of the fact that Fauchelevent lent\nme his name, I have no right to use it; he could give it to me, but I\ncould not take it. A name is an _I_. You see, sir, that I have thought\nsomewhat, I have read a little, although I am a peasant; and you see\nthat I express myself properly. I understand things. I have procured\nmyself an education. Well, yes, to abstract a name and to place oneself\nunder it is dishonest. Letters of the alphabet can be filched, like a\npurse or a watch. To be a false signature in flesh and blood, to be a\nliving false key, to enter the house of honest people by picking their\nlock, never more to look straightforward, to forever eye askance, to be\ninfamous within the _I_, no! no! no! no! no! It is better to suffer, to\nbleed, to weep, to tear one’s skin from the flesh with one’s nails, to\npass nights writhing in anguish, to devour oneself body and soul. That\nis why I have just told you all this. Wantonly, as you say.”\n\n\nHe drew a painful breath, and hurled this final word:\n\n“In days gone by, I stole a loaf of bread in order to live; to-day, in\norder to live, I will not steal a name.”\n\n\n“To live!” interrupted Marius. “You do not need that name in order to\nlive?”\n\n\n“Ah! I understand the matter,” said Jean Valjean, raising and lowering\nhis head several times in succession.\n\nA silence ensued. Both held their peace, each plunged in a gulf of\nthoughts. Marius was sitting near a table and resting the corner of his\nmouth on one of his fingers, which was folded back. Jean Valjean was\npacing to and fro. He paused before a mirror, and remained motionless.\nThen, as though replying to some inward course of reasoning, he said,\nas he gazed at the mirror, which he did not see:\n\n“While, at present, I am relieved.”\n\n\nHe took up his march again, and walked to the other end of the\ndrawing-room. At the moment when he turned round, he perceived that\nMarius was watching his walk. Then he said, with an inexpressible\nintonation:\n\n“I drag my leg a little. Now you understand why!”\n\n\nThen he turned fully round towards Marius:\n\n“And now, sir, imagine this: I have said nothing, I have remained\nMonsieur Fauchelevent, I have taken my place in your house, I am one of\nyou, I am in my chamber, I come to breakfast in the morning in\nslippers, in the evening all three of us go to the play, I accompany\nMadame Pontmercy to the Tuileries, and to the Place Royale, we are\ntogether, you think me your equal; one fine day you are there, and I am\nthere, we are conversing, we are laughing; all at once, you hear a\nvoice shouting this name: ‘Jean Valjean!’ and behold, that terrible\nhand, the police, darts from the darkness, and abruptly tears off my\nmask!”\n\n\nAgain he paused; Marius had sprung to his feet with a shudder. Jean\nValjean resumed:\n\n“What do you say to that?”\n\n\nMarius’ silence answered for him.\n\nJean Valjean continued:\n\n“You see that I am right in not holding my peace. Be happy, be in\nheaven, be the angel of an angel, exist in the sun, be content\ntherewith, and do not trouble yourself about the means which a poor\ndamned wretch takes to open his breast and force his duty to come\nforth; you have before you, sir, a wretched man.”\n\n\nMarius slowly crossed the room, and, when he was quite close to Jean\nValjean, he offered the latter his hand.\n\nBut Marius was obliged to step up and take that hand which was not\noffered, Jean Valjean let him have his own way, and it seemed to Marius\nthat he pressed a hand of marble.\n\n“My grandfather has friends,” said Marius; “I will procure your\npardon.”\n\n\n“It is useless,” replied Jean Valjean. “I am believed to be dead, and\nthat suffices. The dead are not subjected to surveillance. They are\nsupposed to rot in peace. Death is the same thing as pardon.”\n\n\nAnd, disengaging the hand which Marius held, he added, with a sort of\ninexorable dignity:\n\n“Moreover, the friend to whom I have recourse is the doing of my duty;\nand I need but one pardon, that of my conscience.”\n\n\nAt that moment, a door at the other end of the drawing-room opened\ngently half way, and in the opening Cosette’s head appeared. They saw\nonly her sweet face, her hair was in charming disorder, her eyelids\nwere still swollen with sleep. She made the movement of a bird, which\nthrusts its head out of its nest, glanced first at her husband, then at\nJean Valjean, and cried to them with a smile, so that they seemed to\nbehold a smile at the heart of a rose:\n\n“I will wager that you are talking politics. How stupid that is,\ninstead of being with me!”\n\n\nJean Valjean shuddered.\n\n“Cosette! . . .” stammered Marius.\n\nAnd he paused. One would have said that they were two criminals.\n\nCosette, who was radiant, continued to gaze at both of them. There was\nsomething in her eyes like gleams of paradise.\n\n“I have caught you in the very act,” said Cosette. “Just now, I heard\nmy father Fauchelevent through the door saying: ‘Conscience . . . doing\nmy duty . . .’ That is politics, indeed it is. I will not have it.\nPeople should not talk politics the very next day. It is not right.”\n\n\n“You are mistaken. Cosette,” said Marius, “we are talking business. We\nare discussing the best investment of your six hundred thousand francs\n. . .”\n\n\n“That is not it at all,” interrupted Cosette. “I am coming. Does\nanybody want me here?”\n\n\nAnd, passing resolutely through the door, she entered the drawing-room.\nShe was dressed in a voluminous white dressing-gown, with a thousand\nfolds and large sleeves which, starting from the neck, fell to her\nfeet. In the golden heavens of some ancient gothic pictures, there are\nthese charming sacks fit to clothe the angels.\n\nShe contemplated herself from head to foot in a long mirror, then\nexclaimed, in an outburst of ineffable ecstasy:\n\n“There was once a King and a Queen. Oh! how happy I am!”\n\n\nThat said, she made a curtsey to Marius and to Jean Valjean.\n\n“There,” said she, “I am going to install myself near you in an\neasy-chair, we breakfast in half an hour, you shall say anything you\nlike, I know well that men must talk, and I will be very good.”\n\n\nMarius took her by the arm and said lovingly to her:\n\n“We are talking business.”\n\n\n“By the way,” said Cosette, “I have opened my window, a flock of\npierrots has arrived in the garden,—Birds, not maskers. To-day is\nAsh-Wednesday; but not for the birds.”\n\n\n“I tell you that we are talking business, go, my little Cosette, leave\nus alone for a moment. We are talking figures. That will bore you.”\n\n\n“You have a charming cravat on this morning, Marius. You are very\ndandified, monseigneur. No, it will not bore me.”\n\n\n“I assure you that it will bore you.”\n\n\n“No. Since it is you. I shall not understand you, but I shall listen to\nyou. When one hears the voices of those whom one loves, one does not\nneed to understand the words that they utter. That we should be here\ntogether—that is all that I desire. I shall remain with you, bah!”\n\n\n“You are my beloved Cosette! Impossible.”\n\n\n“Impossible!”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Very good,” said Cosette. “I was going to tell you some news. I could\nhave told you that your grandfather is still asleep, that your aunt is\nat mass, that the chimney in my father Fauchelevent’s room smokes, that\nNicolette has sent for the chimney-sweep, that Toussaint and Nicolette\nhave already quarrelled, that Nicolette makes sport of Toussaint’s\nstammer. Well, you shall know nothing. Ah! it is impossible? you shall\nsee, gentlemen, that I, in my turn, can say: It is impossible. Then who\nwill be caught? I beseech you, my little Marius, let me stay here with\nyou two.”\n\n\n“I swear to you, that it is indispensable that we should be alone.”\n\n\n“Well, am I anybody?”\n\n\nJean Valjean had not uttered a single word. Cosette turned to him:\n\n“In the first place, father, I want you to come and embrace me. What do\nyou mean by not saying anything instead of taking my part? who gave me\nsuch a father as that? You must perceive that my family life is very\nunhappy. My husband beats me. Come, embrace me instantly.”\n\n\nJean Valjean approached.\n\nCosette turned toward Marius.\n\n“As for you, I shall make a face at you.”\n\n\nThen she presented her brow to Jean Valjean.\n\nJean Valjean advanced a step toward her.\n\nCosette recoiled.\n\n“Father, you are pale. Does your arm hurt you?”\n\n\n“It is well,” said Jean Valjean.\n\n“Did you sleep badly?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“Are you sad?”\n\n\n“No.”\n\n\n“Embrace me if you are well, if you sleep well, if you are content, I\nwill not scold you.”\n\n\nAnd again she offered him her brow.\n\nJean Valjean dropped a kiss upon that brow whereon rested a celestial\ngleam.\n\n“Smile.”\n\n\nJean Valjean obeyed. It was the smile of a spectre.\n\n“Now, defend me against my husband.”\n\n\n“Cosette! . . .” ejaculated Marius.\n\n“Get angry, father. Say that I must stay. You can certainly talk before\nme. So you think me very silly. What you say is astonishing! business,\nplacing money in a bank a great matter truly. Men make mysteries out of\nnothing. I am very pretty this morning. Look at me, Marius.”\n\n\nAnd with an adorable shrug of the shoulders, and an indescribably\nexquisite pout, she glanced at Marius.\n\n“I love you!” said Marius.\n\n“I adore you!” said Cosette.\n\nAnd they fell irresistibly into each other’s arms.\n\n“Now,” said Cosette, adjusting a fold of her dressing-gown, with a\ntriumphant little grimace, “I shall stay.”\n\n\n“No, not that,” said Marius, in a supplicating tone. “We have to finish\nsomething.”\n\n\n“Still no?”\n\n\nMarius assumed a grave tone:\n\n“I assure you, Cosette, that it is impossible.”\n\n\n“Ah! you put on your man’s voice, sir. That is well, I go. You, father,\nhave not upheld me. Monsieur my father, monsieur my husband, you are\ntyrants. I shall go and tell grandpapa. If you think that I am going to\nreturn and talk platitudes to you, you are mistaken. I am proud. I\nshall wait for you now. You shall see, that it is you who are going to\nbe bored without me. I am going, it is well.”\n\n\nAnd she left the room.\n\nTwo seconds later, the door opened once more, her fresh and rosy head\nwas again thrust between the two leaves, and she cried to them:\n\n“I am very angry indeed.”\n\n\nThe door closed again, and the shadows descended once more.\n\nIt was as though a ray of sunlight should have suddenly traversed the\nnight, without itself being conscious of it.\n\nMarius made sure that the door was securely closed.\n\n“Poor Cosette!” he murmured, “when she finds out . . .”\n\n\nAt that word Jean Valjean trembled in every limb. He fixed on Marius a\nbewildered eye.\n\n“Cosette! oh yes, it is true, you are going to tell Cosette about this.\nThat is right. Stay, I had not thought of that. One has the strength\nfor one thing, but not for another. Sir, I conjure you, I entreat now,\nsir, give me your most sacred word of honor, that you will not tell\nher. Is it not enough that you should know it? I have been able to say\nit myself without being forced to it, I could have told it to the\nuniverse, to the whole world,—it was all one to me. But she, she does\nnot know what it is, it would terrify her. What, a convict! we should\nbe obliged to explain matters to her, to say to her: ‘He is a man who\nhas been in the galleys.’ She saw the chain-gang pass by one day. Oh!\nMy God!” . . . He dropped into an armchair and hid his face in his\nhands.\n\nHis grief was not audible, but from the quivering of his shoulders it\nwas evident that he was weeping. Silent tears, terrible tears.\n\nThere is something of suffocation in the sob. He was seized with a sort\nof convulsion, he threw himself against the back of the chair as though\nto gain breath, letting his arms fall, and allowing Marius to see his\nface inundated with tears, and Marius heard him murmur, so low that his\nvoice seemed to issue from fathomless depths:\n\n“Oh! would that I could die!”\n\n\n“Be at your ease,” said Marius, “I will keep your secret for myself\nalone.”\n\n\nAnd, less touched, perhaps, than he ought to have been, but forced, for\nthe last hour, to familiarize himself with something as unexpected as\nit was dreadful, gradually beholding the convict superposed before his\nvery eyes, upon M. Fauchelevent, overcome, little by little, by that\nlugubrious reality, and led, by the natural inclination of the\nsituation, to recognize the space which had just been placed between\nthat man and himself, Marius added:\n\n“It is impossible that I should not speak a word to you with regard to\nthe deposit which you have so faithfully and honestly remitted. That is\nan act of probity. It is just that some recompense should be bestowed\non you. Fix the sum yourself, it shall be counted out to you. Do not\nfear to set it very high.”\n\n\n“I thank you, sir,” replied Jean Valjean, gently.\n\nHe remained in thought for a moment, mechanically passing the tip of\nhis fore-finger across his thumb-nail, then he lifted up his voice:\n\n“All is nearly over. But one last thing remains for me . . .”\n\n\n“What is it?”\n\n\nJean Valjean struggled with what seemed a last hesitation, and, without\nvoice, without breath, he stammered rather than said:\n\n“Now that you know, do you think, sir, you, who are the master, that I\nought not to see Cosette any more?”\n\n\n“I think that would be better,” replied Marius coldly.\n\n“I shall never see her more,” murmured Jean Valjean. And he directed\nhis steps towards the door.\n\nHe laid his hand on the knob, the latch yielded, the door opened. Jean\nValjean pushed it open far enough to pass through, stood motionless for\na second, then closed the door again and turned to Marius.\n\nHe was no longer pale, he was livid. There were no longer any tears in\nhis eyes, but only a sort of tragic flame. His voice had regained a\nstrange composure.\n\n“Stay, sir,” he said. “If you will allow it, I will come to see her. I\nassure you that I desire it greatly. If I had not cared to see Cosette,\nI should not have made to you the confession that I have made, I should\nhave gone away; but, as I desired to remain in the place where Cosette\nis, and to continue to see her, I had to tell you about it honestly.\nYou follow my reasoning, do you not? it is a matter easily understood.\nYou see, I have had her with me for more than nine years. We lived\nfirst in that hut on the boulevard, then in the convent, then near the\nLuxembourg. That was where you saw her for the first time. You remember\nher blue plush hat. Then we went to the Quartier des Invalides, where\nthere was a railing on a garden, the Rue Plumet. I lived in a little\nback court-yard, whence I could hear her piano. That was my life. We\nnever left each other. That lasted for nine years and some months. I\nwas like her own father, and she was my child. I do not know whether\nyou understand, Monsieur Pontmercy, but to go away now, never to see\nher again, never to speak to her again, to no longer have anything,\nwould be hard. If you do not disapprove of it, I will come to see\nCosette from time to time. I will not come often. I will not remain\nlong. You shall give orders that I am to be received in the little\nwaiting-room. On the ground floor. I could enter perfectly well by the\nback door, but that might create surprise perhaps, and it would be\nbetter, I think, for me to enter by the usual door. Truly, sir, I\nshould like to see a little more of Cosette. As rarely as you please.\nPut yourself in my place, I have nothing left but that. And then, we\nmust be cautious. If I no longer come at all, it would produce a bad\neffect, it would be considered singular. What I can do, by the way, is\nto come in the afternoon, when night is beginning to fall.”\n\n\n“You shall come every evening,” said Marius, “and Cosette will be\nwaiting for you.”\n\n\n“You are kind, sir,” said Jean Valjean.\n\nMarius saluted Jean Valjean, happiness escorted despair to the door,\nand these two men parted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—THE OBSCURITIES WHICH A REVELATION CAN CONTAIN\n\n\nMarius was quite upset.\n\nThe sort of estrangement which he had always felt towards the man\nbeside whom he had seen Cosette, was now explained to him. There was\nsomething enigmatic about that person, of which his instinct had warned\nhim.\n\nThis enigma was the most hideous of disgraces, the galleys. This M.\nFauchelevent was the convict Jean Valjean.\n\nTo abruptly find such a secret in the midst of one’s happiness\nresembles the discovery of a scorpion in a nest of turtledoves.\n\nWas the happiness of Marius and Cosette thenceforth condemned to such a\nneighborhood? Was this an accomplished fact? Did the acceptance of that\nman form a part of the marriage now consummated? Was there nothing to\nbe done?\n\nHad Marius wedded the convict as well?\n\nIn vain may one be crowned with light and joy, in vain may one taste\nthe grand purple hour of life, happy love, such shocks would force even\nthe archangel in his ecstasy, even the demigod in his glory, to\nshudder.\n\nAs is always the case in changes of view of this nature, Marius asked\nhimself whether he had nothing with which to reproach himself. Had he\nbeen wanting in divination? Had he been wanting in prudence? Had he\ninvoluntarily dulled his wits? A little, perhaps. Had he entered upon\nthis love affair, which had ended in his marriage to Cosette, without\ntaking sufficient precautions to throw light upon the surroundings? He\nadmitted,—it is thus, by a series of successive admissions of ourselves\nin regard to ourselves, that life amends us, little by little,—he\nadmitted the chimerical and visionary side of his nature, a sort of\ninternal cloud peculiar to many organizations, and which, in paroxysms\nof passion and sorrow, dilates as the temperature of the soul changes,\nand invades the entire man, to such a degree as to render him nothing\nmore than a conscience bathed in a mist. We have more than once\nindicated this characteristic element of Marius’ individuality.\n\nHe recalled that, in the intoxication of his love, in the Rue Plumet,\nduring those six or seven ecstatic weeks, he had not even spoken to\nCosette of that drama in the Gorbeau hovel, where the victim had taken\nup such a singular line of silence during the struggle and the ensuing\nflight. How had it happened that he had not mentioned this to Cosette?\nYet it was so near and so terrible! How had it come to pass that he had\nnot even named the Thénardiers, and, particularly, on the day when he\nhad encountered Éponine? He now found it almost difficult to explain\nhis silence of that time. Nevertheless, he could account for it. He\nrecalled his benumbed state, his intoxication with Cosette, love\nabsorbing everything, that catching away of each other into the ideal,\nand perhaps also, like the imperceptible quantity of reason mingled\nwith this violent and charming state of the soul, a vague, dull\ninstinct impelling him to conceal and abolish in his memory that\nredoubtable adventure, contact with which he dreaded, in which he did\nnot wish to play any part, his agency in which he had kept secret, and\nin which he could be neither narrator nor witness without being an\naccuser.\n\nMoreover, these few weeks had been a flash of lightning; there had been\nno time for anything except love.\n\nIn short, having weighed everything, turned everything over in his\nmind, examined everything, whatever might have been the consequences if\nhe had told Cosette about the Gorbeau ambush, even if he had discovered\nthat Jean Valjean was a convict, would that have changed him, Marius?\nWould that have changed her, Cosette? Would he have drawn back? Would\nhe have adored her any the less? Would he have refrained from marrying\nher? No. Then there was nothing to regret, nothing with which he need\nreproach himself. All was well. There is a deity for those drunken men\nwho are called lovers. Marius blind, had followed the path which he\nwould have chosen had he been in full possession of his sight. Love had\nbandaged his eyes, in order to lead him whither? To paradise.\n\nBut this paradise was henceforth complicated with an infernal\naccompaniment.\n\nMarius’ ancient estrangement towards this man, towards this\nFauchelevent who had turned into Jean Valjean, was at present mingled\nwith horror.\n\nIn this horror, let us state, there was some pity, and even a certain\nsurprise.\n\nThis thief, this thief guilty of a second offence, had restored that\ndeposit. And what a deposit! Six hundred thousand francs.\n\nHe alone was in the secret of that deposit. He might have kept it all,\nhe had restored it all.\n\nMoreover, he had himself revealed his situation. Nothing forced him to\nthis. If any one learned who he was, it was through himself. In this\navowal there was something more than acceptance of humiliation, there\nwas acceptance of peril. For a condemned man, a mask is not a mask, it\nis a shelter. A false name is security, and he had rejected that false\nname. He, the galley-slave, might have hidden himself forever in an\nhonest family; he had withstood this temptation. And with what motive?\nThrough a conscientious scruple. He himself explained this with the\nirresistible accents of truth. In short, whatever this Jean Valjean\nmight be, he was, undoubtedly, a conscience which was awakening. There\nexisted some mysterious re-habilitation which had begun; and, to all\nappearances, scruples had for a long time already controlled this man.\nSuch fits of justice and goodness are not characteristic of vulgar\nnatures. An awakening of conscience is grandeur of soul.\n\nJean Valjean was sincere. This sincerity, visible, palpable,\nirrefragable, evident from the very grief that it caused him, rendered\ninquiries useless, and conferred authority on all that that man had\nsaid.\n\nHere, for Marius, there was a strange reversal of situations. What\nbreathed from M. Fauchelevent? distrust. What did Jean Valjean inspire?\nconfidence.\n\nIn the mysterious balance of this Jean Valjean which the pensive Marius\nstruck, he admitted the active principle, he admitted the passive\nprinciple, and he tried to reach a balance.\n\nBut all this went on as in a storm. Marius, while endeavoring to form a\nclear idea of this man, and while pursuing Jean Valjean, so to speak,\nin the depths of his thought, lost him and found him again in a fatal\nmist.\n\nThe deposit honestly restored, the probity of the confession—these were\ngood. This produced a lightening of the cloud, then the cloud became\nblack once more.\n\nTroubled as were Marius’ memories, a shadow of them returned to him.\n\nAfter all, what was that adventure in the Jondrette attic? Why had that\nman taken to flight on the arrival of the police, instead of entering a\ncomplaint?\n\nHere Marius found the answer. Because that man was a fugitive from\njustice, who had broken his ban.\n\nAnother question: Why had that man come to the barricade?\n\nFor Marius now once more distinctly beheld that recollection which had\nreappeared in his emotions like sympathetic ink at the application of\nheat. This man had been in the barricade. He had not fought there. What\nhad he come there for? In the presence of this question a spectre\nsprang up and replied: “Javert.”\n\n\nMarius recalled perfectly now that funereal sight of Jean Valjean\ndragging the pinioned Javert out of the barricade, and he still heard\nbehind the corner of the little Rue Mondétour that frightful pistol\nshot. Obviously, there was hatred between that police spy and the\ngalley-slave. The one was in the other’s way. Jean Valjean had gone to\nthe barricade for the purpose of revenging himself. He had arrived\nlate. He probably knew that Javert was a prisoner there. The Corsican\nvendetta has penetrated to certain lower strata and has become the law\nthere; it is so simple that it does not astonish souls which are but\nhalf turned towards good; and those hearts are so constituted that a\ncriminal, who is in the path of repentance, may be scrupulous in the\nmatter of theft and unscrupulous in the matter of vengeance. Jean\nValjean had killed Javert. At least, that seemed to be evident.\n\nThis was the final question, to be sure; but to this there was no\nreply. This question Marius felt like pincers. How had it come to pass\nthat Jean Valjean’s existence had elbowed that of Cosette for so long a\nperiod?\n\nWhat melancholy sport of Providence was that which had placed that\nchild in contact with that man? Are there then chains for two which are\nforged on high? and does God take pleasure in coupling the angel with\nthe demon? So a crime and an innocence can be room-mates in the\nmysterious galleys of wretchedness? In that defiling of condemned\npersons which is called human destiny, can two brows pass side by side,\nthe one ingenuous, the other formidable, the one all bathed in the\ndivine whiteness of dawn, the other forever blemished by the flash of\nan eternal lightning? Who could have arranged that inexplicable pairing\noff? In what manner, in consequence of what prodigy, had any community\nof life been established between this celestial little creature and\nthat old criminal?\n\nWho could have bound the lamb to the wolf, and, what was still more\nincomprehensible, have attached the wolf to the lamb? For the wolf\nloved the lamb, for the fierce creature adored the feeble one, for,\nduring the space of nine years, the angel had had the monster as her\npoint of support. Cosette’s childhood and girlhood, her advent in the\ndaylight, her virginal growth towards life and light, had been\nsheltered by that hideous devotion. Here questions exfoliated, so to\nspeak, into innumerable enigmas, abysses yawned at the bottoms of\nabysses, and Marius could no longer bend over Jean Valjean without\nbecoming dizzy. What was this man-precipice?\n\nThe old symbols of Genesis are eternal; in human society, such as it\nnow exists, and until a broader day shall effect a change in it, there\nwill always be two men, the one superior, the other subterranean; the\none which is according to good is Abel; the other which is according to\nevil is Cain. What was this tender Cain? What was this ruffian\nreligiously absorbed in the adoration of a virgin, watching over her,\nrearing her, guarding her, dignifying her, and enveloping her, impure\nas he was himself, with purity?\n\nWhat was that cesspool which had venerated that innocence to such a\npoint as not to leave upon it a single spot? What was this Jean Valjean\neducating Cosette? What was this figure of the shadows which had for\nits only object the preservation of the rising of a star from every\nshadow and from every cloud?\n\nThat was Jean Valjean’s secret; that was also God’s secret.\n\nIn the presence of this double secret, Marius recoiled. The one, in\nsome sort, reassured him as to the other. God was as visible in this\naffair as was Jean Valjean. God has his instruments. He makes use of\nthe tool which he wills. He is not responsible to men. Do we know how\nGod sets about the work? Jean Valjean had labored over Cosette. He had,\nto some extent, made that soul. That was incontestable. Well, what\nthen? The workman was horrible; but the work was admirable. God\nproduces his miracles as seems good to him. He had constructed that\ncharming Cosette, and he had employed Jean Valjean. It had pleased him\nto choose this strange collaborator for himself. What account have we\nto demand of him? Is this the first time that the dung-heap has aided\nthe spring to create the rose?\n\nMarius made himself these replies, and declared to himself that they\nwere good. He had not dared to press Jean Valjean on all the points\nwhich we have just indicated, but he did not confess to himself that he\ndid not dare to do it. He adored Cosette, he possessed Cosette, Cosette\nwas splendidly pure. That was sufficient for him. What enlightenment\ndid he need? Cosette was a light. Does light require enlightenment? He\nhad everything; what more could he desire? All,—is not that enough?\nJean Valjean’s personal affairs did not concern him.\n\nAnd bending over the fatal shadow of that man, he clung fast,\nconvulsively, to the solemn declaration of that unhappy wretch: “I am\nnothing to Cosette. Ten years ago I did not know that she was in\nexistence.”\n\n\nJean Valjean was a passer-by. He had said so himself. Well, he had\npassed. Whatever he was, his part was finished.\n\nHenceforth, there remained Marius to fulfil the part of Providence to\nCosette. Cosette had sought the azure in a person like herself, in her\nlover, her husband, her celestial male. Cosette, as she took her\nflight, winged and transfigured, left behind her on the earth her\nhideous and empty chrysalis, Jean Valjean.\n\nIn whatever circle of ideas Marius revolved, he always returned to a\ncertain horror for Jean Valjean. A sacred horror, perhaps, for, as we\nhave just pointed out, he felt a _quid divinum_ in that man. But do\nwhat he would, and seek what extenuation he would, he was certainly\nforced to fall back upon this: the man was a convict; that is to say, a\nbeing who has not even a place in the social ladder, since he is lower\nthan the very lowest rung. After the very last of men comes the\nconvict. The convict is no longer, so to speak, in the semblance of the\nliving. The law has deprived him of the entire quantity of humanity of\nwhich it can deprive a man.\n\nMarius, on penal questions, still held to the inexorable system, though\nhe was a democrat and he entertained all the ideas of the law on the\nsubject of those whom the law strikes. He had not yet accomplished all\nprogress, we admit. He had not yet come to distinguish between that\nwhich is written by man and that which is written by God, between law\nand right. He had not examined and weighed the right which man takes to\ndispose of the irrevocable and the irreparable. He was not shocked by\nthe word _vindicte_. He found it quite simple that certain breaches of\nthe written law should be followed by eternal suffering, and he\naccepted, as the process of civilization, social damnation. He still\nstood at this point, though safe to advance infallibly later on, since\nhis nature was good, and, at bottom, wholly formed of latent progress.\n\nIn this stage of his ideas, Jean Valjean appeared to him hideous and\nrepulsive. He was a man reproved, he was the convict. That word was for\nhim like the sound of the trump on the Day of Judgment; and, after\nhaving reflected upon Jean Valjean for a long time, his final gesture\nhad been to turn away his head. _Vade retro_.\n\nMarius, if we must recognize and even insist upon the fact, while\ninterrogating Jean Valjean to such a point that Jean Valjean had said:\n“You are confessing me,” had not, nevertheless, put to him two or three\ndecisive questions.\n\nIt was not that they had not presented themselves to his mind, but that\nhe had been afraid of them. The Jondrette attic? The barricade? Javert?\nWho knows where these revelations would have stopped? Jean Valjean did\nnot seem like a man who would draw back, and who knows whether Marius,\nafter having urged him on, would not have himself desired to hold him\nback?\n\nHas it not happened to all of us, in certain supreme conjunctures, to\nstop our ears in order that we may not hear the reply, after we have\nasked a question? It is especially when one loves that one gives way to\nthese exhibitions of cowardice. It is not wise to question sinister\nsituations to the last point, particularly when the indissoluble side\nof our life is fatally intermingled with them. What a terrible light\nmight have proceeded from the despairing explanations of Jean Valjean,\nand who knows whether that hideous glare would not have darted forth as\nfar as Cosette? Who knows whether a sort of infernal glow would not\nhave lingered behind it on the brow of that angel? The spattering of a\nlightning-flash is of the thunder also. Fatality has points of juncture\nwhere innocence itself is stamped with crime by the gloomy law of the\nreflections which give color. The purest figures may forever preserve\nthe reflection of a horrible association. Rightly or wrongly, Marius\nhad been afraid. He already knew too much. He sought to dull his senses\nrather than to gain further light.\n\nIn dismay he bore off Cosette in his arms and shut his eyes to Jean\nValjean.\n\nThat man was the night, the living and horrible night. How should he\ndare to seek the bottom of it? It is a terrible thing to interrogate\nthe shadow. Who knows what its reply will be? The dawn may be blackened\nforever by it.\n\nIn this state of mind the thought that that man would, henceforth, come\ninto any contact whatever with Cosette was a heartrending perplexity to\nMarius.\n\nHe now almost reproached himself for not having put those formidable\nquestions, before which he had recoiled, and from which an implacable\nand definitive decision might have sprung. He felt that he was too\ngood, too gentle, too weak, if we must say the word. This weakness had\nled him to an imprudent concession. He had allowed himself to be\ntouched. He had been in the wrong. He ought to have simply and purely\nrejected Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean played the part of fire, and that\nis what he should have done, and have freed his house from that man.\n\nHe was vexed with himself, he was angry with that whirlwind of emotions\nwhich had deafened, blinded, and carried him away. He was displeased\nwith himself.\n\nWhat was he to do now? Jean Valjean’s visits were profoundly repugnant\nto him. What was the use in having that man in his house? What did the\nman want? Here, he became dismayed, he did not wish to dig down, he did\nnot wish to penetrate deeply; he did not wish to sound himself. He had\npromised, he had allowed himself to be drawn into a promise; Jean\nValjean held his promise; one must keep one’s word even to a convict,\nabove all to a convict. Still, his first duty was to Cosette. In short,\nhe was carried away by the repugnance which dominated him.\n\nMarius turned over all this confusion of ideas in his mind, passing\nfrom one to the other, and moved by all of them. Hence arose a profound\ntrouble.\n\nIt was not easy for him to hide this trouble from Cosette, but love is\na talent, and Marius succeeded in doing it.\n\nHowever, without any apparent object, he questioned Cosette, who was as\ncandid as a dove is white and who suspected nothing; he talked of her\nchildhood and her youth, and he became more and more convinced that\nthat convict had been everything good, paternal and respectable that a\nman can be towards Cosette. All that Marius had caught a glimpse of and\nhad surmised was real. That sinister nettle had loved and protected\nthat lily.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHTH—FADING AWAY OF THE TWILIGHT\n\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nThe Twilight Decline  5b8-1-decline\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—THE LOWER CHAMBER\n\n\nOn the following day, at nightfall, Jean Valjean knocked at the\ncarriage gate of the Gillenormand house. It was Basque who received\nhim. Basque was in the courtyard at the appointed hour, as though he\nhad received his orders. It sometimes happens that one says to a\nservant: “You will watch for Mr. So and So, when he arrives.”\n\n\nBasque addressed Jean Valjean without waiting for the latter to\napproach him:\n\n“Monsieur le Baron has charged me to inquire whether monsieur desires\nto go upstairs or to remain below?”\n\n\n“I will remain below,” replied Jean Valjean.\n\nBasque, who was perfectly respectful, opened the door of the\nwaiting-room and said:\n\n“I will go and inform Madame.”\n\n\nThe room which Jean Valjean entered was a damp, vaulted room on the\nground floor, which served as a cellar on occasion, which opened on the\nstreet, was paved with red squares and was badly lighted by a grated\nwindow.\n\nThis chamber was not one of those which are harassed by the\nfeather-duster, the pope’s head brush, and the broom. The dust rested\ntranquilly there. Persecution of the spiders was not organized there. A\nfine web, which spread far and wide, and was very black and ornamented\nwith dead flies, formed a wheel on one of the window-panes. The room,\nwhich was small and low-ceiled, was furnished with a heap of empty\nbottles piled up in one corner.\n\nThe wall, which was daubed with an ochre yellow wash, was scaling off\nin large flakes. At one end there was a chimney-piece painted in black\nwith a narrow shelf. A fire was burning there; which indicated that\nJean Valjean’s reply: “I will remain below,” had been foreseen.\n\nTwo armchairs were placed at the two corners of the fireplace. Between\nthe chairs an old bedside rug, which displayed more foundation thread\nthan wool, had been spread by way of a carpet.\n\nThe chamber was lighted by the fire on the hearth and the twilight\nfalling through the window.\n\nJean Valjean was fatigued. For days he had neither eaten nor slept. He\nthrew himself into one of the armchairs.\n\nBasque returned, set a lighted candle on the chimney-piece and retired.\nJean Valjean, his head drooping and his chin resting on his breast,\nperceived neither Basque nor the candle.\n\nAll at once, he drew himself up with a start. Cosette was standing\nbeside him.\n\nHe had not seen her enter, but he had felt that she was there.\n\nHe turned round. He gazed at her. She was adorably lovely. But what he\nwas contemplating with that profound gaze was not her beauty but her\nsoul.\n\n“Well,” exclaimed Cosette, “father, I knew that you were peculiar, but\nI never should have expected this. What an idea! Marius told me that\nyou wish me to receive you here.”\n\n\n“Yes, it is my wish.”\n\n\n“I expected that reply. Good. I warn you that I am going to make a\nscene for you. Let us begin at the beginning. Embrace me, father.”\n\n\nAnd she offered him her cheek.\n\nJean Valjean remained motionless.\n\n“You do not stir. I take note of it. Attitude of guilt. But never mind,\nI pardon you. Jesus Christ said: Offer the other cheek. Here it is.”\n\n\nAnd she presented her other cheek.\n\nJean Valjean did not move. It seemed as though his feet were nailed to\nthe pavement.\n\n“This is becoming serious,” said Cosette. “What have I done to you? I\ndeclare that I am perplexed. You owe me reparation. You will dine with\nus.”\n\n\n“I have dined.”\n\n\n“That is not true. I will get M. Gillenormand to scold you.\nGrandfathers are made to reprimand fathers. Come. Go upstairs with me\nto the drawing-room. Immediately.”\n\n\n“Impossible.”\n\n\nHere Cosette lost ground a little. She ceased to command and passed to\nquestioning.\n\n“But why? and you choose the ugliest chamber in the house in which to\nsee me. It’s horrible here.”\n\n\n“Thou knowest . . .”\n\n\nJean Valjean caught himself up.\n\n“You know, madame, that I am peculiar, I have my freaks.”\n\n\nCosette struck her tiny hands together.\n\n“Madame! . . . You know! . . . more novelties! What is the meaning of\nthis?”\n\n\nJean Valjean directed upon her that heartrending smile to which he\noccasionally had recourse:\n\n“You wished to be Madame. You are so.”\n\n\n“Not for you, father.”\n\n\n“Do not call me father.”\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“Call me ‘Monsieur Jean.’ ‘Jean,’ if you like.”\n\n\n“You are no longer my father? I am no longer Cosette? ‘Monsieur Jean’?\nWhat does this mean? why, these are revolutions, aren’t they? what has\ntaken place? come, look me in the face. And you won’t live with us! And\nyou won’t have my chamber! What have I done to you? Has anything\nhappened?”\n\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n\n“Well then?”\n\n\n“Everything is as usual.”\n\n\n“Why do you change your name?”\n\n\n“You have changed yours, surely.”\n\n\nHe smiled again with the same smile as before and added:\n\n“Since you are Madame Pontmercy, I certainly can be Monsieur Jean.”\n\n\n“I don’t understand anything about it. All this is idiotic. I shall ask\npermission of my husband for you to be ‘Monsieur Jean.’ I hope that he\nwill not consent to it. You cause me a great deal of pain. One does\nhave freaks, but one does not cause one’s little Cosette grief. That is\nwrong. You have no right to be wicked, you who are so good.”\n\n\nHe made no reply.\n\nShe seized his hands with vivacity, and raising them to her face with\nan irresistible movement, she pressed them against her neck beneath her\nchin, which is a gesture of profound tenderness.\n\n“Oh!” she said to him, “be good!”\n\n\nAnd she went on:\n\n“This is what I call being good: being nice and coming and living\nhere,—there are birds here as there are in the Rue Plumet,—living with\nus, quitting that hole of a Rue de l’Homme Armé, not giving us riddles\nto guess, being like all the rest of the world, dining with us,\nbreakfasting with us, being my father.”\n\n\nHe loosed her hands.\n\n“You no longer need a father, you have a husband.”\n\n\nCosette became angry.\n\n“I no longer need a father! One really does not know what to say to\nthings like that, which are not common sense!”\n\n\n“If Toussaint were here,” resumed Jean Valjean, like a person who is\ndriven to seek authorities, and who clutches at every branch, “she\nwould be the first to agree that it is true that I have always had ways\nof my own. There is nothing new in this. I always have loved my black\ncorner.”\n\n\n“But it is cold here. One cannot see distinctly. It is abominable, that\nit is, to wish to be Monsieur Jean! I will not have you say ‘you’ to\nme.\n\n“Just now, as I was coming hither,” replied Jean Valjean, “I saw a\npiece of furniture in the Rue Saint Louis. It was at a cabinet-maker’s.\nIf I were a pretty woman, I would treat myself to that bit of\nfurniture. A very neat toilet table in the reigning style. What you\ncall rosewood, I think. It is inlaid. The mirror is quite large. There\nare drawers. It is pretty.”\n\n\n“Hou! the villainous bear!” replied Cosette.\n\nAnd with supreme grace, setting her teeth and drawing back her lips,\nshe blew at Jean Valjean. She was a Grace copying a cat.\n\n“I am furious,” she resumed. “Ever since yesterday, you have made me\nrage, all of you. I am greatly vexed. I don’t understand. You do not\ndefend me against Marius. Marius will not uphold me against you. I am\nall alone. I arrange a chamber prettily. If I could have put the good\nGod there I would have done it. My chamber is left on my hands. My\nlodger sends me into bankruptcy. I order a nice little dinner of\nNicolette. We will have nothing to do with your dinner, Madame. And my\nfather Fauchelevent wants me to call him ‘Monsieur Jean,’ and to\nreceive him in a frightful, old, ugly cellar, where the walls have\nbeards, and where the crystal consists of empty bottles, and the\ncurtains are of spiders’ webs! You are singular, I admit, that is your\nstyle, but people who get married are granted a truce. You ought not to\nhave begun being singular again instantly. So you are going to be\nperfectly contented in your abominable Rue de l’Homme Armé. I was very\ndesperate indeed there, that I was. What have you against me? You cause\nme a great deal of grief. Fi!”\n\n\nAnd, becoming suddenly serious, she gazed intently at Jean Valjean and\nadded:\n\n“Are you angry with me because I am happy?”\n\n\nIngenuousness sometimes unconsciously penetrates deep. This question,\nwhich was simple for Cosette, was profound for Jean Valjean. Cosette\nhad meant to scratch, and she lacerated.\n\nJean Valjean turned pale.\n\nHe remained for a moment without replying, then, with an inexpressible\nintonation, and speaking to himself, he murmured:\n\n“Her happiness was the object of my life. Now God may sign my\ndismissal. Cosette, thou art happy; my day is over.”\n\n\n“Ah, you have said _thou_ to me!” exclaimed Cosette.\n\nAnd she sprang to his neck.\n\nJean Valjean, in bewilderment, strained her wildly to his breast. It\nalmost seemed to him as though he were taking her back.\n\n“Thanks, father!” said Cosette.\n\nThis enthusiastic impulse was on the point of becoming poignant for\nJean Valjean. He gently removed Cosette’s arms, and took his hat.\n\n“Well?” said Cosette.\n\n“I leave you, Madame, they are waiting for you.”\n\n\nAnd, from the threshold, he added:\n\n“I have said _thou_ to you. Tell your husband that this shall not\nhappen again. Pardon me.”\n\n\nJean Valjean quitted the room, leaving Cosette stupefied at this\nenigmatical farewell.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—ANOTHER STEP BACKWARDS\n\n\nOn the following day, at the same hour, Jean Valjean came.\n\nCosette asked him no questions, was no longer astonished, no longer\nexclaimed that she was cold, no longer spoke of the drawing-room, she\navoided saying either “father” or “Monsieur Jean.” She allowed herself\nto be addressed as _you_. She allowed herself to be called Madame.\nOnly, her joy had undergone a certain diminution. She would have been\nsad, if sadness had been possible to her.\n\nIt is probable that she had had with Marius one of those conversations\nin which the beloved man says what he pleases, explains nothing, and\nsatisfies the beloved woman. The curiosity of lovers does not extend\nvery far beyond their own love.\n\nThe lower room had made a little toilet. Basque had suppressed the\nbottles, and Nicolette the spiders.\n\nAll the days which followed brought Jean Valjean at the same hour. He\ncame every day, because he had not the strength to take Marius’ words\notherwise than literally. Marius arranged matters so as to be absent at\nthe hours when Jean Valjean came. The house grew accustomed to the\nnovel ways of M. Fauchelevent. Toussaint helped in this direction:\n“Monsieur has always been like that,” she repeated. The grandfather\nissued this decree:—“He’s an original.” And all was said. Moreover, at\nthe age of ninety-six, no bond is any longer possible, all is merely\njuxtaposition; a newcomer is in the way. There is no longer any room;\nall habits are acquired. M. Fauchelevent, M. Tranchelevent, Father\nGillenormand asked nothing better than to be relieved from “that\ngentleman.” He added:—“Nothing is more common than those originals.\nThey do all sorts of queer things. They have no reason. The Marquis de\nCanaples was still worse. He bought a palace that he might lodge in the\ngarret. These are fantastic appearances that people affect.”\n\n\nNo one caught a glimpse of the sinister foundation. And moreover, who\ncould have guessed such a thing? There are marshes of this description\nin India. The water seems extraordinary, inexplicable, rippling though\nthere is no wind, and agitated where it should be calm. One gazes at\nthe surface of these causeless ebullitions; one does not perceive the\nhydra which crawls on the bottom.\n\nMany men have a secret monster in this same manner, a dragon which\ngnaws them, a despair which inhabits their night. Such a man resembles\nother men, he goes and comes. No one knows that he bears within him a\nfrightful parasitic pain with a thousand teeth, which lives within the\nunhappy man, and of which he is dying. No one knows that this man is a\ngulf. He is stagnant but deep. From time to time, a trouble of which\nthe onlooker understands nothing appears on his surface. A mysterious\nwrinkle is formed, then vanishes, then reappears; an air-bubble rises\nand bursts. It is the breathing of the unknown beast.\n\nCertain strange habits: arriving at the hour when other people are\ntaking their leave, keeping in the background when other people are\ndisplaying themselves, preserving on all occasions what may be\ndesignated as the wall-colored mantle, seeking the solitary walk,\npreferring the deserted street, avoiding any share in conversation,\navoiding crowds and festivals, seeming at one’s ease and living poorly,\nhaving one’s key in one’s pocket, and one’s candle at the porter’s\nlodge, however rich one may be, entering by the side door, ascending\nthe private staircase,—all these insignificant singularities, fugitive\nfolds on the surface, often proceed from a formidable foundation.\n\nMany weeks passed in this manner. A new life gradually took possession\nof Cosette: the relations which marriage creates, visits, the care of\nthe house, pleasures, great matters. Cosette’s pleasures were not\ncostly, they consisted in one thing: being with Marius. The great\noccupation of her life was to go out with him, to remain with him. It\nwas for them a joy that was always fresh, to go out arm in arm, in the\nface of the sun, in the open street, without hiding themselves, before\nthe whole world, both of them completely alone.\n\nCosette had one vexation. Toussaint could not get on with Nicolette,\nthe soldering of two elderly maids being impossible, and she went away.\nThe grandfather was well; Marius argued a case here and there; Aunt\nGillenormand peacefully led that life aside which sufficed for her,\nbeside the new household. Jean Valjean came every day.\n\nThe address as _thou_ disappeared, the _you_, the “Madame,” the\n“Monsieur Jean,” rendered him another person to Cosette. The care which\nhe had himself taken to detach her from him was succeeding. She became\nmore and more gay and less and less tender. Yet she still loved him\nsincerely, and he felt it.\n\nOne day she said to him suddenly: “You used to be my father, you are no\nlonger my father, you were my uncle, you are no longer my uncle, you\nwere Monsieur Fauchelevent, you are Jean. Who are you then? I don’t\nlike all this. If I did not know how good you are, I should be afraid\nof you.”\n\n\nHe still lived in the Rue de l’Homme Armé, because he could not make up\nhis mind to remove to a distance from the quarter where Cosette dwelt.\n\nAt first, he only remained a few minutes with Cosette, and then went\naway.\n\nLittle by little he acquired the habit of making his visits less brief.\nOne would have said that he was taking advantage of the authorization\nof the days which were lengthening, he arrived earlier and departed\nlater.\n\nOne day Cosette chanced to say “father” to him. A flash of joy\nilluminated Jean Valjean’s melancholy old countenance. He caught her\nup: “Say Jean.”—“Ah! truly,” she replied with a burst of laughter,\n“Monsieur Jean.”—“That is right,” said he. And he turned aside so that\nshe might not see him wipe his eyes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—THEY RECALL THE GARDEN OF THE RUE PLUMET\n\n\nThis was the last time. After that last flash of light, complete\nextinction ensued. No more familiarity, no more good-morning with a\nkiss, never more that word so profoundly sweet: “My father!” He was at\nhis own request and through his own complicity driven out of all his\nhappinesses one after the other; and he had this sorrow, that after\nhaving lost Cosette wholly in one day, he was afterwards obliged to\nlose her again in detail.\n\nThe eye eventually becomes accustomed to the light of a cellar. In\nshort, it sufficed for him to have an apparition of Cosette every day.\nHis whole life was concentrated in that one hour.\n\nHe seated himself close to her, he gazed at her in silence, or he\ntalked to her of years gone by, of her childhood, of the convent, of\nher little friends of those bygone days.\n\nOne afternoon,—it was on one of those early days in April, already warm\nand fresh, the moment of the sun’s great gayety, the gardens which\nsurrounded the windows of Marius and Cosette felt the emotion of\nwaking, the hawthorn was on the point of budding, a jewelled garniture\nof gillyflowers spread over the ancient walls, snapdragons yawned\nthrough the crevices of the stones, amid the grass there was a charming\nbeginning of daisies, and buttercups, the white butterflies of the year\nwere making their first appearance, the wind, that minstrel of the\neternal wedding, was trying in the trees the first notes of that grand,\nauroral symphony which the old poets called the springtide,—Marius said\nto Cosette:—“We said that we would go back to take a look at our garden\nin the Rue Plumet. Let us go thither. We must not be ungrateful.”—And\naway they flitted, like two swallows towards the spring. This garden of\nthe Rue Plumet produced on them the effect of the dawn. They already\nhad behind them in life something which was like the springtime of\ntheir love. The house in the Rue Plumet being held on a lease, still\nbelonged to Cosette. They went to that garden and that house. There\nthey found themselves again, there they forgot themselves. That\nevening, at the usual hour, Jean Valjean came to the Rue des\nFilles-du-Calvaire.—“Madame went out with Monsieur and has not yet\nreturned,” Basque said to him. He seated himself in silence, and waited\nan hour. Cosette did not return. He departed with drooping head.\n\nCosette was so intoxicated with her walk to “their garden,” and so\njoyous at having “lived a whole day in her past,” that she talked of\nnothing else on the morrow. She did not notice that she had not seen\nJean Valjean.\n\n“In what way did you go thither?” Jean Valjean asked her.”\n\n\n“On foot.”\n\n\n“And how did you return?”\n\n\n“In a hackney carriage.”\n\n\nFor some time, Jean Valjean had noticed the economical life led by the\nyoung people. He was troubled by it. Marius’ economy was severe, and\nthat word had its absolute meaning for Jean Valjean. He hazarded a\nquery:\n\n“Why do you not have a carriage of your own? A pretty coupé would only\ncost you five hundred francs a month. You are rich.”\n\n\n“I don’t know,” replied Cosette.\n\n“It is like Toussaint,” resumed Jean Valjean. “She is gone. You have\nnot replaced her. Why?”\n\n\n“Nicolette suffices.”\n\n\n“But you ought to have a maid.”\n\n\n“Have I not Marius?”\n\n\n“You ought to have a house of your own, your own servants, a carriage,\na box at the theatre. There is nothing too fine for you. Why not profit\nby your riches? Wealth adds to happiness.”\n\n\nCosette made no reply.\n\nJean Valjean’s visits were not abridged. Far from it. When it is the\nheart which is slipping, one does not halt on the downward slope.\n\nWhen Jean Valjean wished to prolong his visit and to induce\nforgetfulness of the hour, he sang the praises of Marius; he pronounced\nhim handsome, noble, courageous, witty, eloquent, good. Cosette outdid\nhim. Jean Valjean began again. They were never weary. Marius—that word\nwas inexhaustible; those six letters contained volumes. In this manner,\nJean Valjean contrived to remain a long time.\n\nIt was so sweet to see Cosette, to forget by her side! It alleviated\nhis wounds. It frequently happened that Basque came twice to announce:\n“M. Gillenormand sends me to remind Madame la Baronne that dinner is\nserved.”\n\n\nOn those days, Jean Valjean was very thoughtful on his return home.\n\nWas there, then, any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis which\nhad presented itself to the mind of Marius? Was Jean Valjean really a\nchrysalis who would persist, and who would come to visit his butterfly?\n\nOne day he remained still longer than usual. On the following day he\nobserved that there was no fire on the hearth.—“Hello!” he thought. “No\nfire.”—And he furnished the explanation for himself.—“It is perfectly\nsimple. It is April. The cold weather has ceased.”\n\n\n“Heavens! how cold it is here!” exclaimed Cosette when she entered.\n\n“Why, no,” said Jean Valjean.\n\n“Was it you who told Basque not to make a fire then?”\n\n\n“Yes, since we are now in the month of May.”\n\n\n“But we have a fire until June. One is needed all the year in this\ncellar.”\n\n\n“I thought that a fire was unnecessary.”\n\n\n“That is exactly like one of your ideas!” retorted Cosette.\n\nOn the following day there was a fire. But the two armchairs were\narranged at the other end of the room near the door. “—What is the\nmeaning of this?” thought Jean Valjean.\n\nHe went for the armchairs and restored them to their ordinary place\nnear the hearth.\n\nThis fire lighted once more encouraged him, however. He prolonged the\nconversation even beyond its customary limits. As he rose to take his\nleave, Cosette said to him:\n\n“My husband said a queer thing to me yesterday.”\n\n\n“What was it?”\n\n\n“He said to me: ‘Cosette, we have an income of thirty thousand livres.\nTwenty-seven that you own, and three that my grandfather gives me.’ I\nreplied: ‘That makes thirty.’ He went on: ‘Would you have the courage\nto live on the three thousand?’ I answered: ‘Yes, on nothing. Provided\nthat it was with you.’ And then I asked: ‘Why do you say that to me?’\nHe replied: ‘I wanted to know.’”\n\n\nJean Valjean found not a word to answer. Cosette probably expected some\nexplanation from him; he listened in gloomy silence. He went back to\nthe Rue de l’Homme Armé; he was so deeply absorbed that he mistook the\ndoor and instead of entering his own house, he entered the adjoining\ndwelling. It was only after having ascended nearly two stories that he\nperceived his error and went down again.\n\nHis mind was swarming with conjectures. It was evident that Marius had\nhis doubts as to the origin of the six hundred thousand francs, that he\nfeared some source that was not pure, who knows? that he had even,\nperhaps, discovered that the money came from him, Jean Valjean, that he\nhesitated before this suspicious fortune, and was disinclined to take\nit as his own,—preferring that both he and Cosette should remain poor,\nrather than that they should be rich with wealth that was not clean.\n\nMoreover, Jean Valjean began vaguely to surmise that he was being shown\nthe door.\n\nOn the following day, he underwent something like a shock on entering\nthe ground-floor room. The armchairs had disappeared. There was not a\nsingle chair of any sort.\n\n“Ah, what’s this!” exclaimed Cosette as she entered, “no chairs! Where\nare the armchairs?”\n\n\n“They are no longer here,” replied Jean Valjean.\n\n“This is too much!”\n\n\nJean Valjean stammered:\n\n“It was I who told Basque to remove them.”\n\n\n“And your reason?”\n\n\n“I have only a few minutes to stay to-day.”\n\n\n“A brief stay is no reason for remaining standing.”\n\n\n“I think that Basque needed the chairs for the drawing-room.”\n\n\n“Why?”\n\n\n“You have company this evening, no doubt.”\n\n\n“We expect no one.”\n\n\nJean Valjean had not another word to say.\n\nCosette shrugged her shoulders.\n\n“To have the chairs carried off! The other day you had the fire put\nout. How odd you are!”\n\n\n“Adieu!” murmured Jean Valjean.\n\nHe did not say: “Adieu, Cosette.” But he had not the strength to say:\n“Adieu, Madame.”\n\n\nHe went away utterly overwhelmed.\n\nThis time he had understood.\n\nOn the following day he did not come. Cosette only observed the fact in\nthe evening.\n\n“Why,” said she, “Monsieur Jean has not been here today.”\n\n\nAnd she felt a slight twinge at her heart, but she hardly perceived it,\nbeing immediately diverted by a kiss from Marius.\n\nOn the following day he did not come.\n\nCosette paid no heed to this, passed her evening and slept well that\nnight, as usual, and thought of it only when she woke. She was so\nhappy! She speedily despatched Nicolette to M. Jean’s house to inquire\nwhether he were ill, and why he had not come on the previous evening.\nNicolette brought back the reply of M. Jean that he was not ill. He was\nbusy. He would come soon. As soon as he was able. Moreover, he was on\nthe point of taking a little journey. Madame must remember that it was\nhis custom to take trips from time to time. They were not to worry\nabout him. They were not to think of him.\n\nNicolette on entering M. Jean’s had repeated to him her mistress’ very\nwords. That Madame had sent her to inquire why M. Jean had not come on\nthe preceding evening. ”—It is two days since I have been there,” said\nJean Valjean gently.\n\nBut the remark passed unnoticed by Nicolette, who did not report it to\nCosette.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—ATTRACTION AND EXTINCTION\n\n\nDuring the last months of spring and the first months of summer in\n1833, the rare passers-by in the Marais, the petty shopkeepers, the\nloungers on thresholds, noticed an old man neatly clad in black, who\nemerged every day at the same hour, towards nightfall, from the Rue de\nl’Homme Armé, on the side of the Rue Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie,\npassed in front of the Blancs Manteaux, gained the Rue\nCulture-Sainte-Catherine, and, on arriving at the Rue de l‘Écharpe,\nturned to the left, and entered the Rue Saint-Louis.\n\nThere he walked at a slow pace, with his head strained forward, seeing\nnothing, hearing nothing, his eye immovably fixed on a point which\nseemed to be a star to him, which never varied, and which was no other\nthan the corner of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. The nearer he\napproached the corner of the street the more his eye lighted up; a sort\nof joy illuminated his pupils like an inward aurora, he had a\nfascinated and much affected air, his lips indulged in obscure\nmovements, as though he were talking to some one whom he did not see,\nhe smiled vaguely and advanced as slowly as possible. One would have\nsaid that, while desirous of reaching his destination, he feared the\nmoment when he should be close at hand. When only a few houses remained\nbetween him and that street which appeared to attract him his pace\nslackened, to such a degree that, at times, one might have thought that\nhe was no longer advancing at all. The vacillation of his head and the\nfixity of his eyeballs suggested the thought of the magnetic needle\nseeking the pole. Whatever time he spent on arriving, he was obliged to\narrive at last; he reached the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; then he\nhalted, he trembled, he thrust his head with a sort of melancholy\ntimidity round the corner of the last house, and gazed into that\nstreet, and there was in that tragic look something which resembled the\ndazzling light of the impossible, and the reflection from a paradise\nthat was closed to him. Then a tear, which had slowly gathered in the\ncorner of his lids, and had become large enough to fall, trickled down\nhis cheek, and sometimes stopped at his mouth. The old man tasted its\nbitter flavor. Thus he remained for several minutes as though made of\nstone, then he returned by the same road and with the same step, and,\nin proportion as he retreated, his glance died out.\n\nLittle by little, this old man ceased to go as far as the corner of the\nRue des Filles-du-Calvaire; he halted half way in the Rue Saint-Louis;\nsometimes a little further off, sometimes a little nearer.\n\nOne day he stopped at the corner of the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine\nand looked at the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire from a distance. Then he\nshook his head slowly from right to left, as though refusing himself\nsomething, and retraced his steps.\n\nSoon he no longer came as far as the Rue Saint-Louis. He got as far as\nthe Rue Pavée, shook his head and turned back; then he went no further\nthan the Rue des Trois-Pavillons; then he did not overstep the\nBlancs-Manteaux. One would have said that he was a pendulum which was\nno longer wound up, and whose oscillations were growing shorter before\nceasing altogether.\n\nEvery day he emerged from his house at the same hour, he undertook the\nsame trip, but he no longer completed it, and, perhaps without himself\nbeing aware of the fact, he constantly shortened it. His whole\ncountenance expressed this single idea: What is the use?—His eye was\ndim; no more radiance. His tears were also exhausted; they no longer\ncollected in the corner of his eye-lid; that thoughtful eye was dry.\nThe old man’s head was still craned forward; his chin moved at times;\nthe folds in his gaunt neck were painful to behold. Sometimes, when the\nweather was bad, he had an umbrella under his arm, but he never opened\nit.\n\nThe good women of the quarter said: “He is an innocent.” The children\nfollowed him and laughed.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK NINTH—SUPREME SHADOW, SUPREME DAWN\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—PITY FOR THE UNHAPPY, BUT INDULGENCE FOR THE HAPPY\n\n\nIt is a terrible thing to be happy! How content one is! How\nall-sufficient one finds it! How, being in possession of the false\nobject of life, happiness, one forgets the true object, duty!\n\nLet us say, however, that the reader would do wrong were he to blame\nMarius.\n\nMarius, as we have explained, before his marriage, had put no questions\nto M. Fauchelevent, and, since that time, he had feared to put any to\nJean Valjean. He had regretted the promise into which he had allowed\nhimself to be drawn. He had often said to himself that he had done\nwrong in making that concession to despair. He had confined himself to\ngradually estranging Jean Valjean from his house and to effacing him,\nas much as possible, from Cosette’s mind. He had, in a manner, always\nplaced himself between Cosette and Jean Valjean, sure that, in this\nway, she would not perceive nor think of the latter. It was more than\neffacement, it was an eclipse.\n\nMarius did what he considered necessary and just. He thought that he\nhad serious reasons which the reader has already seen, and others which\nwill be seen later on, for getting rid of Jean Valjean without\nharshness, but without weakness.\n\nChance having ordained that he should encounter, in a case which he had\nargued, a former employee of the Laffitte establishment, he had\nacquired mysterious information, without seeking it, which he had not\nbeen able, it is true, to probe, out of respect for the secret which he\nhad promised to guard, and out of consideration for Jean Valjean’s\nperilous position. He believed at that moment that he had a grave duty\nto perform: the restitution of the six hundred thousand francs to some\none whom he sought with all possible discretion. In the meanwhile, he\nabstained from touching that money.\n\nAs for Cosette, she had not been initiated into any of these secrets;\nbut it would be harsh to condemn her also.\n\nThere existed between Marius and her an all-powerful magnetism, which\ncaused her to do, instinctively and almost mechanically, what Marius\nwished. She was conscious of Marius’ will in the direction of “Monsieur\nJean,” she conformed to it. Her husband had not been obliged to say\nanything to her; she yielded to the vague but clear pressure of his\ntacit intentions, and obeyed blindly. Her obedience in this instance\nconsisted in not remembering what Marius forgot. She was not obliged to\nmake any effort to accomplish this. Without her knowing why herself,\nand without his having any cause to accuse her of it, her soul had\nbecome so wholly her husband’s that that which was shrouded in gloom in\nMarius’ mind became overcast in hers.\n\nLet us not go too far, however; in what concerns Jean Valjean, this\nforgetfulness and obliteration were merely superficial. She was rather\nheedless than forgetful. At bottom, she was sincerely attached to the\nman whom she had so long called her father; but she loved her husband\nstill more dearly. This was what had somewhat disturbed the balance of\nher heart, which leaned to one side only.\n\nIt sometimes happened that Cosette spoke of Jean Valjean and expressed\nher surprise. Then Marius calmed her: “He is absent, I think. Did not\nhe say that he was setting out on a journey?”—“That is true,” thought\nCosette. “He had a habit of disappearing in this fashion. But not for\nso long.” Two or three times she despatched Nicolette to inquire in the\nRue de l’Homme Armé whether M. Jean had returned from his journey. Jean\nValjean caused the answer “no” to be given.\n\nCosette asked nothing more, since she had but one need on earth,\nMarius.\n\nLet us also say that, on their side, Cosette and Marius had also been\nabsent. They had been to Vernon. Marius had taken Cosette to his\nfather’s grave.\n\nMarius gradually won Cosette away from Jean Valjean. Cosette allowed\nit.\n\nMoreover that which is called, far too harshly in certain cases, the\ningratitude of children, is not always a thing so deserving of reproach\nas it is supposed. It is the ingratitude of nature. Nature, as we have\nelsewhere said, “looks before her.” Nature divides living beings into\nthose who are arriving and those who are departing. Those who are\ndeparting are turned towards the shadows, those who are arriving\ntowards the light. Hence a gulf which is fatal on the part of the old,\nand involuntary on the part of the young. This breach, at first\ninsensible, increases slowly, like all separations of branches. The\nboughs, without becoming detached from the trunk, grow away from it. It\nis no fault of theirs. Youth goes where there is joy, festivals, vivid\nlights, love. Old age goes towards the end. They do not lose sight of\neach other, but there is no longer a close connection. Young people\nfeel the cooling off of life; old people, that of the tomb. Let us not\nblame these poor children.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—LAST FLICKERINGS OF A LAMP WITHOUT OIL\n\n\nOne day, Jean Valjean descended his staircase, took three steps in the\nstreet, seated himself on a post, on that same stone post where\nGavroche had found him meditating on the night between the 5th and the\n6th of June; he remained there a few moments, then went upstairs again.\nThis was the last oscillation of the pendulum. On the following day he\ndid not leave his apartment. On the day after that, he did not leave\nhis bed.\n\nHis portress, who prepared his scanty repasts, a few cabbages or\npotatoes with bacon, glanced at the brown earthenware plate and\nexclaimed:\n\n“But you ate nothing yesterday, poor, dear man!”\n\n\n“Certainly I did,” replied Jean Valjean.\n\n“The plate is quite full.”\n\n\n“Look at the water jug. It is empty.”\n\n\n“That proves that you have drunk; it does not prove that you have\neaten.”\n\n\n“Well,” said Jean Valjean, “what if I felt hungry only for water?”\n\n\n“That is called thirst, and, when one does not eat at the same time, it\nis called fever.”\n\n\n“I will eat to-morrow.”\n\n\n“Or at Trinity day. Why not to-day? Is it the thing to say: ‘I will eat\nto-morrow’? The idea of leaving my platter without even touching it! My\nlady-finger potatoes were so good!”\n\n\nJean Valjean took the old woman’s hand:\n\n“I promise you that I will eat them,” he said, in his benevolent voice.\n\n“I am not pleased with you,” replied the portress.\n\nJean Valjean saw no other human creature than this good woman. There\nare streets in Paris through which no one ever passes, and houses to\nwhich no one ever comes. He was in one of those streets and one of\nthose houses.\n\nWhile he still went out, he had purchased of a coppersmith, for a few\nsous, a little copper crucifix which he had hung up on a nail opposite\nhis bed. That gibbet is always good to look at.\n\nA week passed, and Jean Valjean had not taken a step in his room. He\nstill remained in bed. The portress said to her husband:—“The good man\nupstairs yonder does not get up, he no longer eats, he will not last\nlong. That man has his sorrows, that he has. You won’t get it out of my\nhead that his daughter has made a bad marriage.”\n\n\nThe porter replied, with the tone of marital sovereignty:\n\n“If he’s rich, let him have a doctor. If he is not rich, let him go\nwithout. If he has no doctor he will die.”\n\n\n“And if he has one?”\n\n\n“He will die,” said the porter.\n\nThe portress set to scraping away the grass from what she called her\npavement, with an old knife, and, as she tore out the blades, she\ngrumbled:\n\n“It’s a shame. Such a neat old man! He’s as white as a chicken.”\n\n\nShe caught sight of the doctor of the quarter as he passed the end of\nthe street; she took it upon herself to request him to come upstairs.\n\n“It’s on the second floor,” said she. “You have only to enter. As the\ngood man no longer stirs from his bed, the door is always unlocked.”\n\n\nThe doctor saw Jean Valjean and spoke with him.\n\nWhen he came down again the portress interrogated him:\n\n“Well, doctor?”\n\n\n“Your sick man is very ill indeed.”\n\n\n“What is the matter with him?”\n\n\n“Everything and nothing. He is a man who, to all appearances, has lost\nsome person who is dear to him. People die of that.”\n\n\n“What did he say to you?”\n\n\n“He told me that he was in good health.”\n\n\n“Shall you come again, doctor?”\n\n\n“Yes,” replied the doctor. “But some one else besides must come.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—A PEN IS HEAVY TO THE MAN WHO LIFTED THE FAUCHELEVENT’S\nCART\n\n\nOne evening Jean Valjean found difficulty in raising himself on his\nelbow; he felt of his wrist and could not find his pulse; his breath\nwas short and halted at times; he recognized the fact that he was\nweaker than he had ever been before. Then, no doubt under the pressure\nof some supreme preoccupation, he made an effort, drew himself up into\na sitting posture and dressed himself. He put on his old workingman’s\nclothes. As he no longer went out, he had returned to them and\npreferred them. He was obliged to pause many times while dressing\nhimself; merely putting his arms through his waistcoat made the\nperspiration trickle from his forehead.\n\nSince he had been alone, he had placed his bed in the antechamber, in\norder to inhabit that deserted apartment as little as possible.\n\nHe opened the valise and drew from it Cosette’s outfit.\n\nHe spread it out on his bed.\n\nThe Bishop’s candlesticks were in their place on the chimney-piece. He\ntook from a drawer two wax candles and put them in the candlesticks.\nThen, although it was still broad daylight,—it was summer,—he lighted\nthem. In the same way candles are to be seen lighted in broad daylight\nin chambers where there is a corpse.\n\nEvery step that he took in going from one piece of furniture to another\nexhausted him, and he was obliged to sit down. It was not ordinary\nfatigue which expends the strength only to renew it; it was the remnant\nof all movement possible to him, it was life drained which flows away\ndrop by drop in overwhelming efforts and which will never be renewed.\n\nThe chair into which he allowed himself to fall was placed in front of\nthat mirror, so fatal for him, so providential for Marius, in which he\nhad read Cosette’s reversed writing on the blotting book. He caught\nsight of himself in this mirror, and did not recognize himself. He was\neighty years old; before Marius’ marriage, he would have hardly been\ntaken for fifty; that year had counted for thirty. What he bore on his\nbrow was no longer the wrinkles of age, it was the mysterious mark of\ndeath. The hollowing of that pitiless nail could be felt there. His\ncheeks were pendulous; the skin of his face had the color which would\nlead one to think that it already had earth upon it; the corners of his\nmouth drooped as in the mask which the ancients sculptured on tombs. He\ngazed into space with an air of reproach; one would have said that he\nwas one of those grand tragic beings who have cause to complain of some\none.\n\nHe was in that condition, the last phase of dejection, in which sorrow\nno longer flows; it is coagulated, so to speak; there is something on\nthe soul like a clot of despair.\n\nNight had come. He laboriously dragged a table and the old armchair to\nthe fireside, and placed upon the table a pen, some ink and some paper.\n\nThat done, he had a fainting fit. When he recovered consciousness, he\nwas thirsty. As he could not lift the jug, he tipped it over painfully\ntowards his mouth, and swallowed a draught.\n\nAs neither the pen nor the ink had been used for a long time, the point\nof the pen had curled up, the ink had dried away, he was forced to rise\nand put a few drops of water in the ink, which he did not accomplish\nwithout pausing and sitting down two or three times, and he was\ncompelled to write with the back of the pen. He wiped his brow from\ntime to time.\n\nThen he turned towards the bed, and, still seated, for he could not\nstand, he gazed at the little black gown and all those beloved objects.\n\nThese contemplations lasted for hours which seemed minutes.\n\nAll at once he shivered, he felt that a child was taking possession of\nhim; he rested his elbows on the table, which was illuminated by the\nBishop’s candles and took up the pen. His hand trembled. He wrote\nslowly the few following lines:\n\n“Cosette, I bless thee. I am going to explain to thee. Thy husband was\nright in giving me to understand that I ought to go away; but there is\na little error in what he believed, though he was in the right. He is\nexcellent. Love him well even after I am dead. Monsieur Pontmercy, love\nmy darling child well. Cosette, this paper will be found; this is what\nI wish to say to thee, thou wilt see the figures, if I have the\nstrength to recall them, listen well, this money is really thine. Here\nis the whole matter: White jet comes from Norway, black jet comes from\nEngland, black glass jewellery comes from Germany. Jet is the lightest,\nthe most precious, the most costly. Imitations can be made in France as\nwell as in Germany. What is needed is a little anvil two inches square,\nand a lamp burning spirits of wine to soften the wax. The wax was\nformerly made with resin and lampblack, and cost four livres the pound.\nI invented a way of making it with gum shellac and turpentine. It does\nnot cost more than thirty sous, and is much better. Buckles are made\nwith a violet glass which is stuck fast, by means of this wax, to a\nlittle framework of black iron. The glass must be violet for iron\njewellery, and black for gold jewellery. Spain buys a great deal of it.\nIt is the country of jet . . .”\n\n\nHere he paused, the pen fell from his fingers, he was seized by one of\nthose sobs which at times welled up from the very depths of his being;\nthe poor man clasped his head in both hands, and meditated.\n\n“Oh!” he exclaimed within himself [lamentable cries, heard by God\nalone], “all is over. I shall never see her more. She is a smile which\npassed over me. I am about to plunge into the night without even seeing\nher again. Oh! one minute, one instant, to hear her voice, to touch her\ndress, to gaze upon her, upon her, the angel! and then to die! It is\nnothing to die, what is frightful is to die without seeing her. She\nwould smile on me, she would say a word to me, would that do any harm\nto any one? No, all is over, and forever. Here I am all alone. My God!\nMy God! I shall never see her again!” At that moment there came a knock\nat the door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—A BOTTLE OF INK WHICH ONLY SUCCEEDED IN WHITENING\n\n\nThat same day, or to speak more accurately, that same evening, as\nMarius left the table, and was on the point of withdrawing to his\nstudy, having a case to look over, Basque handed him a letter saying:\n“The person who wrote the letter is in the antechamber.”\n\n\nCosette had taken the grandfather’s arm and was strolling in the\ngarden.\n\nA letter, like a man, may have an unprepossessing exterior. Coarse\npaper, coarsely folded—the very sight of certain missives is\ndispleasing.\n\nThe letter which Basque had brought was of this sort.\n\nMarius took it. It smelled of tobacco. Nothing evokes a memory like an\nodor. Marius recognized that tobacco. He looked at the superscription:\n“To Monsieur, Monsieur le Baron Pommerci. At his hotel.” The\nrecognition of the tobacco caused him to recognize the writing as well.\nIt may be said that amazement has its lightning flashes.\n\nMarius was, as it were, illuminated by one of these flashes.\n\nThe sense of smell, that mysterious aid to memory, had just revived a\nwhole world within him. This was certainly the paper, the fashion of\nfolding, the dull tint of ink; it was certainly the well-known\nhandwriting, especially was it the same tobacco.\n\nThe Jondrette garret rose before his mind.\n\nThus, strange freak of chance! one of the two scents which he had so\ndiligently sought, the one in connection with which he had lately again\nexerted so many efforts and which he supposed to be forever lost, had\ncome and presented itself to him of its own accord.\n\nHe eagerly broke the seal, and read:\n\n“Monsieur le Baron:—If the Supreme Being had given me the talents, I\nmight have been baron Thénard, member of the Institute [acadenmy of\nciences], but I am not.  I only bear the same as him, happy if this\nmemory recommends me to the eccellence of your kindnesses. The benefit\nwith which you will honor me will be reciprocle. I am in possession of\na secret concerning an individual. This individual concerns you.  I\nhold the secret at your disposal desiring to have the honor to be\nhuseful to you.  I will furnish you with the simple means of driving\nfrom your honorabel family that individual who has no right there,\nmadame la baronne being of lofty birth.  The sanctuary of virtue cannot\ncohabit longer with crime without abdicating.\n\n“I awate in the entichamber the orders of monsieur le baron.\n\n“With respect.”\n\n\nThe letter was signed “Thénard.”\n\n\nThis signature was not false. It was merely a trifle abridged.\n\nMoreover, the rigmarole and the orthography completed the revelation.\nThe certificate of origin was complete.\n\nMarius’ emotion was profound. After a start of surprise, he underwent a\nfeeling of happiness. If he could now but find that other man of whom\nhe was in search, the man who had saved him, Marius, there would be\nnothing left for him to desire.\n\nHe opened the drawer of his secretary, took out several bank-notes, put\nthem in his pocket, closed the secretary again, and rang the bell.\nBasque half opened the door.\n\n“Show the man in,” said Marius.\n\nBasque announced:\n\n“Monsieur Thénard.”\n\n\nA man entered.\n\nA fresh surprise for Marius. The man who entered was an utter stranger\nto him.\n\nThis man, who was old, moreover, had a thick nose, his chin swathed in\na cravat, green spectacles with a double screen of green taffeta over\nhis eyes, and his hair was plastered and flattened down on his brow on\na level with his eyebrows like the wigs of English coachmen in “high\nlife.” His hair was gray. He was dressed in black from head to foot, in\ngarments that were very threadbare but clean; a bunch of seals\ndepending from his fob suggested the idea of a watch. He held in his\nhand an old hat! He walked in a bent attitude, and the curve in his\nspine augmented the profundity of his bow.\n\nThe first thing that struck the observer was, that this personage’s\ncoat, which was too ample although carefully buttoned, had not been\nmade for him.\n\nHere a short digression becomes necessary.\n\nThere was in Paris at that epoch, in a low-lived old lodging in the Rue\nBeautreillis, near the Arsenal, an ingenious Jew whose profession was\nto change villains into honest men. Not for too long, which might have\nproved embarrassing for the villain. The change was on sight, for a day\nor two, at the rate of thirty sous a day, by means of a costume which\nresembled the honesty of the world in general as nearly as possible.\nThis costumer was called “the Changer”; the pickpockets of Paris had\ngiven him this name and knew him by no other. He had a tolerably\ncomplete wardrobe. The rags with which he tricked out people were\nalmost probable. He had specialties and categories; on each nail of his\nshop hung a social status, threadbare and worn; here the suit of a\nmagistrate, there the outfit of a Curé, beyond the outfit of a banker,\nin one corner the costume of a retired military man, elsewhere the\nhabiliments of a man of letters, and further on the dress of a\nstatesman.\n\nThis creature was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery plays\nin Paris. His lair was the green-room whence theft emerged, and into\nwhich roguery retreated. A tattered knave arrived at this\ndressing-room, deposited his thirty sous and selected, according to the\npart which he wished to play, the costume which suited him, and on\ndescending the stairs once more, the knave was a somebody. On the\nfollowing day, the clothes were faithfully returned, and the Changer,\nwho trusted the thieves with everything, was never robbed. There was\none inconvenience about these clothes, they “did not fit”; not having\nbeen made for those who wore them, they were too tight for one, too\nloose for another and did not adjust themselves to any one. Every\npickpocket who exceeded or fell short of the human average was ill at\nhis ease in the Changer’s costumes. It was necessary that one should\nnot be either too fat or too lean. The Changer had foreseen only\nordinary men. He had taken the measure of the species from the first\nrascal who came to hand, who is neither stout nor thin, neither tall\nnor short. Hence adaptations which were sometimes difficult and from\nwhich the Changer’s clients extricated themselves as best they might.\nSo much the worse for the exceptions! The suit of the statesman, for\ninstance, black from head to foot, and consequently proper, would have\nbeen too large for Pitt and too small for Castelcicala. The costume of\na statesman was designated as follows in the Changer’s catalogue; we\ncopy:\n\n“A coat of black cloth, trowsers of black wool, a silk waistcoat, boots\nand linen.” On the margin there stood: _ex-ambassador_, and a note\nwhich we also copy: “In a separate box, a neatly frizzed peruke, green\nglasses, seals, and two small quills an inch long, wrapped in cotton.”\nAll this belonged to the statesman, the ex-ambassador. This whole\ncostume was, if we may so express ourselves, debilitated; the seams\nwere white, a vague button-hole yawned at one of the elbows; moreover,\none of the coat buttons was missing on the breast; but this was only\ndetail; as the hand of the statesman should always be thrust into his\ncoat and laid upon his heart, its function was to conceal the absent\nbutton.\n\nIf Marius had been familiar with the occult institutions of Paris, he\nwould instantly have recognized upon the back of the visitor whom\nBasque had just shown in, the statesman’s suit borrowed from the\npick-me-down-that shop of the Changer.\n\nMarius’ disappointment on beholding another man than the one whom he\nexpected to see turned to the newcomer’s disadvantage.\n\nHe surveyed him from head to foot, while that personage made\nexaggerated bows, and demanded in a curt tone:\n\n“What do you want?”\n\n\nThe man replied with an amiable grin of which the caressing smile of a\ncrocodile will furnish some idea:\n\n“It seems to me impossible that I should not have already had the honor\nof seeing Monsieur le Baron in society. I think I actually did meet\nmonsieur personally, several years ago, at the house of Madame la\nPrincesse Bagration and in the drawing-rooms of his Lordship the\nVicomte Dambray, peer of France.”\n\n\nIt is always a good bit of tactics in knavery to pretend to recognize\nsome one whom one does not know.\n\nMarius paid attention to the manner of this man’s speech. He spied on\nhis accent and gesture, but his disappointment increased; the\npronunciation was nasal and absolutely unlike the dry, shrill tone\nwhich he had expected.\n\nHe was utterly routed.\n\n“I know neither Madame Bagration nor M. Dambray,” said he. “I have\nnever set foot in the house of either of them in my life.”\n\n\nThe reply was ungracious. The personage, determined to be gracious at\nany cost, insisted.\n\n“Then it must have been at Chateaubriand’s that I have seen Monsieur! I\nknow Chateaubriand very well. He is very affable. He sometimes says to\nme: ‘Thénard, my friend . . . won’t you drink a glass of wine with\nme?’”\n\n\nMarius’ brow grew more and more severe:\n\n“I have never had the honor of being received by M. de Chateaubriand.\nLet us cut it short. What do you want?”\n\n\nThe man bowed lower at that harsh voice.\n\n“Monsieur le Baron, deign to listen to me. There is in America, in a\ndistrict near Panama, a village called la Joya. That village is\ncomposed of a single house, a large, square house of three stories,\nbuilt of bricks dried in the sun, each side of the square five hundred\nfeet in length, each story retreating twelve feet back of the story\nbelow, in such a manner as to leave in front a terrace which makes the\ncircuit of the edifice, in the centre an inner court where the\nprovisions and munitions are kept; no windows, loopholes, no doors,\nladders, ladders to mount from the ground to the first terrace, and\nfrom the first to the second, and from the second to the third, ladders\nto descend into the inner court, no doors to the chambers, trap-doors,\nno staircases to the chambers, ladders; in the evening the traps are\nclosed, the ladders are withdrawn, carbines and blunderbusses trained\nfrom the loopholes; no means of entering, a house by day, a citadel by\nnight, eight hundred inhabitants,—that is the village. Why so many\nprecautions? because the country is dangerous; it is full of cannibals.\nThen why do people go there? because the country is marvellous; gold is\nfound there.”\n\n\n“What are you driving at?” interrupted Marius, who had passed from\ndisappointment to impatience.\n\n“At this, Monsieur le Baron. I am an old and weary diplomat. Ancient\ncivilization has thrown me on my own devices. I want to try savages.”\n\n\n“Well?”\n\n\n“Monsieur le Baron, egotism is the law of the world. The proletarian\npeasant woman, who toils by the day, turns round when the diligence\npasses by, the peasant proprietress, who toils in her field, does not\nturn round. The dog of the poor man barks at the rich man, the dog of\nthe rich man barks at the poor man. Each one for himself.\nSelf-interest—that’s the object of men. Gold, that’s the loadstone.”\n\n\n“What then? Finish.”\n\n\n“I should like to go and establish myself at la Joya. There are three\nof us. I have my spouse and my young lady; a very beautiful girl. The\njourney is long and costly. I need a little money.”\n\n\n“What concern is that of mine?” demanded Marius.\n\nThe stranger stretched his neck out of his cravat, a gesture\ncharacteristic of the vulture, and replied with an augmented smile.\n\n“Has not Monsieur le Baron perused my letter?”\n\n\nThere was some truth in this. The fact is, that the contents of the\nepistle had slipped Marius’ mind. He had seen the writing rather than\nread the letter. He could hardly recall it. But a moment ago a fresh\nstart had been given him. He had noted that detail: “my spouse and my\nyoung lady.”\n\n\nHe fixed a penetrating glance on the stranger. An examining judge could\nnot have done the look better. He almost lay in wait for him.\n\nHe confined himself to replying:\n\n“State the case precisely.”\n\n\nThe stranger inserted his two hands in both his fobs, drew himself up\nwithout straightening his dorsal column, but scrutinizing Marius in his\nturn, with the green gaze of his spectacles.\n\n“So be it, Monsieur le Baron. I will be precise. I have a secret to\nsell to you.”\n\n\n“A secret?”\n\n\n“A secret.”\n\n\n“Which concerns me?”\n\n\n“Somewhat.”\n\n\n“What is the secret?”\n\n\nMarius scrutinized the man more and more as he listened to him.\n\n“I commence gratis,” said the stranger. “You will see that I am\ninteresting.”\n\n\n“Speak.”\n\n\n“Monsieur le Baron, you have in your house a thief and an assassin.”\n\n\nMarius shuddered.\n\n“In my house? no,” said he.\n\nThe imperturbable stranger brushed his hat with his elbow and went on:\n\n“An assassin and a thief. Remark, Monsieur le Baron, that I do not here\nspeak of ancient deeds, deeds of the past which have lapsed, which can\nbe effaced by limitation before the law and by repentance before God. I\nspeak of recent deeds, of actual facts as still unknown to justice at\nthis hour. I continue. This man has insinuated himself into your\nconfidence, and almost into your family under a false name. I am about\nto tell you his real name. And to tell it to you for nothing.”\n\n\n“I am listening.”\n\n\n“His name is Jean Valjean.”\n\n\n“I know it.”\n\n\n“I am going to tell you, equally for nothing, who he is.”\n\n\n“Say on.”\n\n\n“He is an ex-convict.”\n\n\n“I know it.”\n\n\n“You know it since I have had the honor of telling you.”\n\n\n“No. I knew it before.”\n\n\nMarius’ cold tone, that double reply of “I know it,” his laconicism,\nwhich was not favorable to dialogue, stirred up some smouldering wrath\nin the stranger. He launched a furious glance on the sly at Marius,\nwhich was instantly extinguished. Rapid as it was, this glance was of\nthe kind which a man recognizes when he has once beheld it; it did not\nescape Marius. Certain flashes can only proceed from certain souls; the\neye, that vent-hole of the thought, glows with it; spectacles hide\nnothing; try putting a pane of glass over hell!\n\nThe stranger resumed with a smile:\n\n“I will not permit myself to contradict Monsieur le Baron. In any case,\nyou ought to perceive that I am well informed. Now what I have to tell\nyou is known to myself alone. This concerns the fortune of Madame la\nBaronne. It is an extraordinary secret. It is for sale—I make you the\nfirst offer of it. Cheap. Twenty thousand francs.”\n\n\n“I know that secret as well as the others,” said Marius.\n\nThe personage felt the necessity of lowering his price a trifle.\n\n“Monsieur le Baron, say ten thousand francs and I will speak.”\n\n\n“I repeat to you that there is nothing which you can tell me. I know\nwhat you wish to say to me.”\n\n\nA fresh flash gleamed in the man’s eye. He exclaimed:\n\n“But I must dine to-day, nevertheless. It is an extraordinary secret, I\ntell you. Monsieur le Baron, I will speak. I speak. Give me twenty\nfrancs.”\n\n\nMarius gazed intently at him:\n\n“I know your extraordinary secret, just as I knew Jean Valjean’s name,\njust as I know your name.”\n\n\n“My name?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“That is not difficult, Monsieur le Baron. I had the honor to write to\nyou and to tell it to you. Thénard.”\n\n\n“—Dier.”\n\n\n“Hey?”\n\n\n“Thénardier.”\n\n\n“Who’s that?”\n\n\nIn danger the porcupine bristles up, the beetle feigns death, the old\nguard forms in a square; this man burst into laughter.\n\nThen he flicked a grain of dust from the sleeve of his coat with a\nfillip.\n\nMarius continued:\n\n“You are also Jondrette the workman, Fabantou the comedian, Genflot the\npoet, Don Alvarès the Spaniard, and Mistress Balizard.”\n\n\n“Mistress what?”\n\n\n“And you kept a pot-house at Montfermeil.”\n\n\n“A pot-house! Never.”\n\n\n“And I tell you that your name is Thénardier.”\n\n\n“I deny it.”\n\n\n“And that you are a rascal. Here.”\n\n\nAnd Marius drew a bank-note from his pocket and flung it in his face.\n\n“Thanks! Pardon me! five hundred francs! Monsieur le Baron!”\n\n\nAnd the man, overcome, bowed, seized the note and examined it.\n\n“Five hundred francs!” he began again, taken aback. And he stammered in\na low voice: “An honest rustler.\"69\n\nThen brusquely:\n\n“Well, so be it!” he exclaimed. “Let us put ourselves at our ease.”\n\n\nAnd with the agility of a monkey, flinging back his hair, tearing off\nhis spectacles, and withdrawing from his nose by sleight of hand the\ntwo quills of which mention was recently made, and which the reader has\nalso met with on another page of this book, he took off his face as the\nman takes off his hat.\n\nHis eye lighted up; his uneven brow, with hollows in some places and\nbumps in others, hideously wrinkled at the top, was laid bare, his nose\nhad become as sharp as a beak; the fierce and sagacious profile of the\nman of prey reappeared.\n\n“Monsieur le Baron is infallible,” he said in a clear voice whence all\nnasal twang had disappeared, “I am Thénardier.”\n\n\nAnd he straightened up his crooked back.\n\nThénardier, for it was really he, was strangely surprised; he would\nhave been troubled, had he been capable of such a thing. He had come to\nbring astonishment, and it was he who had received it. This humiliation\nhad been worth five hundred francs to him, and, taking it all in all,\nhe accepted it; but he was nonetheless bewildered.\n\nHe beheld this Baron Pontmercy for the first time, and, in spite of his\ndisguise, this Baron Pontmercy recognized him, and recognized him\nthoroughly. And not only was this Baron perfectly informed as to\nThénardier, but he seemed well posted as to Jean Valjean. Who was this\nalmost beardless young man, who was so glacial and so generous, who\nknew people’s names, who knew all their names, and who opened his purse\nto them, who bullied rascals like a judge, and who paid them like a\ndupe?\n\nThénardier, the reader will remember, although he had been Marius’\nneighbor, had never seen him, which is not unusual in Paris; he had\nformerly, in a vague way, heard his daughters talk of a very poor young\nman named Marius who lived in the house. He had written to him, without\nknowing him, the letter with which the reader is acquainted.\n\nNo connection between that Marius and M. le Baron Pontmercy was\npossible in his mind.\n\nAs for the name Pontmercy, it will be recalled that, on the battlefield\nof Waterloo, he had only heard the last two syllables, for which he\nalways entertained the legitimate scorn which one owes to what is\nmerely an expression of thanks.\n\nHowever, through his daughter Azelma, who had started on the scent of\nthe married pair on the 16th of February, and through his own personal\nresearches, he had succeeded in learning many things, and, from the\ndepths of his own gloom, he had contrived to grasp more than one\nmysterious clew. He had discovered, by dint of industry, or, at least,\nby dint of induction, he had guessed who the man was whom he had\nencountered on a certain day in the Grand Sewer. From the man he had\neasily reached the name. He knew that Madame la Baronne Pontmercy was\nCosette. But he meant to be discreet in that quarter.\n\nWho was Cosette? He did not know exactly himself. He did, indeed, catch\nan inkling of illegitimacy, the history of Fantine had always seemed to\nhim equivocal; but what was the use of talking about that? in order to\ncause himself to be paid for his silence? He had, or thought he had,\nbetter wares than that for sale. And, according to all appearances, if\nhe were to come and make to the Baron Pontmercy this revelation—and\nwithout proof: “Your wife is a bastard,” the only result would be to\nattract the boot of the husband towards the loins of the revealer.\n\nFrom Thénardier’s point of view, the conversation with Marius had not\nyet begun. He ought to have drawn back, to have modified his strategy,\nto have abandoned his position, to have changed his front; but nothing\nessential had been compromised as yet, and he had five hundred francs\nin his pocket. Moreover, he had something decisive to say, and, even\nagainst this very well-informed and well-armed Baron Pontmercy, he felt\nhimself strong. For men of Thénardier’s nature, every dialogue is a\ncombat. In the one in which he was about to engage, what was his\nsituation? He did not know to whom he was speaking, but he did know of\nwhat he was speaking, he made this rapid review of his inner forces,\nand after having said: “I am Thénardier,” he waited.\n\nMarius had become thoughtful. So he had hold of Thénardier at last.\nThat man whom he had so greatly desired to find was before him. He\ncould honor Colonel Pontmercy’s recommendation.\n\nHe felt humiliated that that hero should have owned anything to this\nvillain, and that the letter of change drawn from the depths of the\ntomb by his father upon him, Marius, had been protested up to that day.\nIt also seemed to him, in the complex state of his mind towards\nThénardier, that there was occasion to avenge the Colonel for the\nmisfortune of having been saved by such a rascal. In any case, he was\ncontent. He was about to deliver the Colonel’s shade from this unworthy\ncreditor at last, and it seemed to him that he was on the point of\nrescuing his father’s memory from the debtors’ prison. By the side of\nthis duty there was another—to elucidate, if possible, the source of\nCosette’s fortune. The opportunity appeared to present itself. Perhaps\nThénardier knew something. It might prove useful to see the bottom of\nthis man.\n\nHe commenced with this.\n\nThénardier had caused the “honest rustler” to disappear in his fob, and\nwas gazing at Marius with a gentleness that was almost tender.\n\nMarius broke the silence.\n\n“Thénardier, I have told you your name. Now, would you like to have me\ntell you your secret—the one that you came here to reveal to me? I have\ninformation of my own, also. You shall see that I know more about it\nthan you do. Jean Valjean, as you have said, is an assassin and a\nthief. A thief, because he robbed a wealthy manufacturer, whose ruin he\nbrought about. An assassin, because he assassinated police-agent\nJavert.”\n\n\n“I don’t understand, sir,” ejaculated Thénardier.\n\n“I will make myself intelligible. In a certain arrondissement of the\nPas de Calais, there was, in 1822, a man who had fallen out with\njustice, and who, under the name of M. Madeleine, had regained his\nstatus and rehabilitated himself. This man had become a just man in the\nfull force of the term. In a trade, the manufacture of black glass\ngoods, he made the fortune of an entire city. As far as his personal\nfortune was concerned he made that also, but as a secondary matter, and\nin some sort, by accident. He was the foster-father of the poor. He\nfounded hospitals, opened schools, visited the sick, dowered young\ngirls, supported widows, and adopted orphans; he was like the guardian\nangel of the country. He refused the cross, he was appointed Mayor. A\nliberated convict knew the secret of a penalty incurred by this man in\nformer days; he denounced him, and had him arrested, and profited by\nthe arrest to come to Paris and cause the banker Laffitte,—I have the\nfact from the cashier himself,—by means of a false signature, to hand\nover to him the sum of over half a million which belonged to M.\nMadeleine. This convict who robbed M. Madeleine was Jean Valjean. As\nfor the other fact, you have nothing to tell me about it either. Jean\nValjean killed the agent Javert; he shot him with a pistol. I, the\nperson who is speaking to you, was present.”\n\n\nThénardier cast upon Marius the sovereign glance of a conquered man who\nlays his hand once more upon the victory, and who has just regained, in\none instant, all the ground which he has lost. But the smile returned\ninstantly. The inferior’s triumph in the presence of his superior must\nbe wheedling.\n\nThénardier contented himself with saying to Marius:\n\n“Monsieur le Baron, we are on the wrong track.”\n\n\nAnd he emphasized this phrase by making his bunch of seals execute an\nexpressive whirl.\n\n“What!” broke forth Marius, “do you dispute that? These are facts.”\n\n\n“They are chimæras. The confidence with which Monsieur le Baron honors\nme renders it my duty to tell him so. Truth and justice before all\nthings. I do not like to see folks accused unjustly. Monsieur le Baron,\nJean Valjean did not rob M. Madeleine and Jean Valjean did not kill\nJavert.”\n\n\n“This is too much! How is this?”\n\n\n“For two reasons.”\n\n\n“What are they? Speak.”\n\n\n“This is the first: he did not rob M. Madeleine, because it is Jean\nValjean himself who was M. Madeleine.”\n\n\n“What tale are you telling me?”\n\n\n“And this is the second: he did not assassinate Javert, because the\nperson who killed Javert was Javert.”\n\n\n“What do you mean to say?”\n\n\n“That Javert committed suicide.”\n\n\n“Prove it! prove it!” cried Marius beside himself.\n\nThénardier resumed, scanning his phrase after the manner of the ancient\nAlexandrine measure:\n\n“Police-agent-Ja-vert-was-found-drowned-un-der-a-boat-of-the-Pont-au-\nChange.”\n\n\n“But prove it!”\n\n\nThénardier drew from his pocket a large envelope of gray paper, which\nseemed to contain sheets folded in different sizes.\n\n“I have my papers,” he said calmly.\n\nAnd he added:\n\n“Monsieur le Baron, in your interests I desired to know Jean Valjean\nthoroughly. I say that Jean Valjean and M. Madeleine are one and the\nsame man, and I say that Javert had no other assassin than Javert. If I\nspeak, it is because I have proofs. Not manuscript proofs—writing is\nsuspicious, handwriting is complaisant,—but printed proofs.”\n\n\nAs he spoke, Thénardier extracted from the envelope two copies of\nnewspapers, yellow, faded, and strongly saturated with tobacco. One of\nthese two newspapers, broken at every fold and falling into rags,\nseemed much older than the other.\n\n“Two facts, two proofs,” remarked Thénardier. And he offered the two\nnewspapers, unfolded, to Marius.\n\nThe reader is acquainted with these two papers. One, the most ancient,\na number of the _Drapeau Blanc_ of the 25th of July, 1823, the text of\nwhich can be seen in the first volume, established the identity of M.\nMadeleine and Jean Valjean.\n\nThe other, a _Moniteur_ of the 15th of June, 1832, announced the\nsuicide of Javert, adding that it appeared from a verbal report of\nJavert to the prefect that, having been taken prisoner in the barricade\nof the Rue de la Chanvrerie, he had owed his life to the magnanimity of\nan insurgent who, holding him under his pistol, had fired into the air,\ninstead of blowing out his brains.\n\nMarius read. He had evidence, a certain date, irrefragable proof, these\ntwo newspapers had not been printed expressly for the purpose of\nbacking up Thénardier’s statements; the note printed in the _Moniteur_\nhad been an administrative communication from the Prefecture of Police.\nMarius could not doubt.\n\nThe information of the cashier-clerk had been false, and he himself had\nbeen deceived.\n\nJean Valjean, who had suddenly grown grand, emerged from his cloud.\nMarius could not repress a cry of joy.\n\n“Well, then this unhappy wretch is an admirable man! the whole of that\nfortune really belonged to him! he is Madeleine, the providence of a\nwhole countryside! he is Jean Valjean, Javert’s savior! he is a hero!\nhe is a saint!”\n\n\n“He’s not a saint, and he’s not a hero!” said Thénardier. “He’s an\nassassin and a robber.”\n\n\nAnd he added, in the tone of a man who begins to feel that he possesses\nsome authority:\n\n“Let us be calm.”\n\n\nRobber, assassin—those words which Marius thought had disappeared and\nwhich returned, fell upon him like an ice-cold shower-bath.\n\n“Again!” said he.\n\n“Always,” ejaculated Thénardier. “Jean Valjean did not rob Madeleine,\nbut he is a thief. He did not kill Javert, but he is a murderer.”\n\n\n“Will you speak,” retorted Marius, “of that miserable theft, committed\nforty years ago, and expiated, as your own newspapers prove, by a whole\nlife of repentance, of self-abnegation and of virtue?”\n\n\n“I say assassination and theft, Monsieur le Baron, and I repeat that I\nam speaking of actual facts. What I have to reveal to you is absolutely\nunknown. It belongs to unpublished matter. And perhaps you will find in\nit the source of the fortune so skilfully presented to Madame la\nBaronne by Jean Valjean. I say skilfully, because, by a gift of that\nnature it would not be so very unskilful to slip into an honorable\nhouse whose comforts one would then share, and, at the same stroke, to\nconceal one’s crime, and to enjoy one’s theft, to bury one’s name and\nto create for oneself a family.”\n\n\n“I might interrupt you at this point,” said Marius, “but go on.”\n\n\n“Monsieur le Baron, I will tell you all, leaving the recompense to your\ngenerosity. This secret is worth massive gold. You will say to me: ‘Why\ndo not you apply to Jean Valjean?’ For a very simple reason; I know\nthat he has stripped himself, and stripped himself in your favor, and I\nconsider the combination ingenious; but he has no longer a son, he\nwould show me his empty hands, and, since I am in need of some money\nfor my trip to la Joya, I prefer you, you who have it all, to him who\nhas nothing. I am a little fatigued, permit me to take a chair.”\n\n\nMarius seated himself and motioned to him to do the same.\n\nThénardier installed himself on a tufted chair, picked up his two\nnewspapers, thrust them back into their envelope, and murmured as he\npecked at the _Drapeau Blanc_ with his nail: “It cost me a good deal of\ntrouble to get this one.”\n\n\nThat done he crossed his legs and stretched himself out on the back of\nthe chair, an attitude characteristic of people who are sure of what\nthey are saying, then he entered upon his subject gravely, emphasizing\nhis words:\n\n“Monsieur le Baron, on the 6th of June, 1832, about a year ago, on the\nday of the insurrection, a man was in the Grand Sewer of Paris, at the\npoint where the sewer enters the Seine, between the Pont des Invalides\nand the Pont de Jéna.”\n\n\nMarius abruptly drew his chair closer to that of Thénardier. Thénardier\nnoticed this movement and continued with the deliberation of an orator\nwho holds his interlocutor and who feels his adversary palpitating\nunder his words:\n\n“This man, forced to conceal himself, and for reasons, moreover, which\nare foreign to politics, had adopted the sewer as his domicile and had\na key to it. It was, I repeat, on the 6th of June; it might have been\neight o’clock in the evening. The man hears a noise in the sewer.\nGreatly surprised, he hides himself and lies in wait. It was the sound\nof footsteps, some one was walking in the dark, and coming in his\ndirection. Strange to say, there was another man in the sewer besides\nhimself. The grating of the outlet from the sewer was not far off. A\nlittle light which fell through it permitted him to recognize the\nnewcomer, and to see that the man was carrying something on his back.\nHe was walking in a bent attitude. The man who was walking in a bent\nattitude was an ex-convict, and what he was dragging on his shoulders\nwas a corpse. Assassination caught in the very act, if ever there was\nsuch a thing. As for the theft, that is understood; one does not kill a\nman gratis. This convict was on his way to fling the body into the\nriver. One fact is to be noticed, that before reaching the exit\ngrating, this convict, who had come a long distance in the sewer, must,\nnecessarily, have encountered a frightful quagmire where it seems as\nthough he might have left the body, but the sewermen would have found\nthe assassinated man the very next day, while at work on the quagmire,\nand that did not suit the assassin’s plans. He had preferred to\ntraverse that quagmire with his burden, and his exertions must have\nbeen terrible, for it is impossible to risk one’s life more completely;\nI don’t understand how he could have come out of that alive.”\n\n\nMarius’ chair approached still nearer. Thénardier took advantage of\nthis to draw a long breath. He went on:\n\n“Monsieur le Baron, a sewer is not the Champ de Mars. One lacks\neverything there, even room. When two men are there, they must meet.\nThat is what happened. The man domiciled there and the passer-by were\nforced to bid each other good-day, greatly to the regret of both. The\npasser-by said to the inhabitant:—“You see what I have on my back, I\nmust get out, you have the key, give it to me.” That convict was a man\nof terrible strength. There was no way of refusing. Nevertheless, the\nman who had the key parleyed, simply to gain time. He examined the dead\nman, but he could see nothing, except that the latter was young, well\ndressed, with the air of being rich, and all disfigured with blood.\nWhile talking, the man contrived to tear and pull off behind, without\nthe assassin perceiving it, a bit of the assassinated man’s coat. A\ndocument for conviction, you understand; a means of recovering the\ntrace of things and of bringing home the crime to the criminal. He put\nthis document for conviction in his pocket. After which he opened the\ngrating, made the man go out with his embarrassment on his back, closed\nthe grating again, and ran off, not caring to be mixed up with the\nremainder of the adventure and above all, not wishing to be present\nwhen the assassin threw the assassinated man into the river. Now you\ncomprehend. The man who was carrying the corpse was Jean Valjean; the\none who had the key is speaking to you at this moment; and the piece of\nthe coat . . .”\n\n\nThénardier completed his phrase by drawing from his pocket, and\nholding, on a level with his eyes, nipped between his two thumbs and\nhis two forefingers, a strip of torn black cloth, all covered with dark\nspots.\n\nMarius had sprung to his feet, pale, hardly able to draw his breath,\nwith his eyes riveted on the fragment of black cloth, and, without\nuttering a word, without taking his eyes from that fragment, he\nretreated to the wall and fumbled with his right hand along the wall\nfor a key which was in the lock of a cupboard near the chimney.\n\nHe found the key, opened the cupboard, plunged his arm into it without\nlooking, and without his frightened gaze quitting the rag which\nThénardier still held outspread.\n\nBut Thénardier continued:\n\n“Monsieur le Baron, I have the strongest of reasons for believing that\nthe assassinated young man was an opulent stranger lured into a trap by\nJean Valjean, and the bearer of an enormous sum of money.”\n\n\n“The young man was myself, and here is the coat!” cried Marius, and he\nflung upon the floor an old black coat all covered with blood.\n\nThen, snatching the fragment from the hands of Thénardier, he crouched\ndown over the coat, and laid the torn morsel against the tattered\nskirt. The rent fitted exactly, and the strip completed the coat.\n\nThénardier was petrified.\n\nThis is what he thought: “I’m struck all of a heap.”\n\n\nMarius rose to his feet trembling, despairing, radiant.\n\nHe fumbled in his pocket and stalked furiously to Thénardier,\npresenting to him and almost thrusting in his face his fist filled with\nbank-notes for five hundred and a thousand francs.\n\n“You are an infamous wretch! you are a liar, a calumniator, a villain.\nYou came to accuse that man, you have only justified him; you wanted to\nruin him, you have only succeeded in glorifying him. And it is you who\nare the thief! And it is you who are the assassin! I saw you,\nThénardier Jondrette, in that lair on the Rue de l’Hôpital. I know\nenough about you to send you to the galleys and even further if I\nchoose. Here are a thousand francs, bully that you are!”\n\n\nAnd he flung a thousand franc note at Thénardier.\n\n“Ah! Jondrette Thénardier, vile rascal! Let this serve you as a lesson,\nyou dealer in second-hand secrets, merchant of mysteries, rummager of\nthe shadows, wretch! Take these five hundred francs and get out of\nhere! Waterloo protects you.”\n\n\n“Waterloo!” growled Thénardier, pocketing the five hundred francs along\nwith the thousand.\n\n“Yes, assassin! You there saved the life of a Colonel. . .”\n\n\n“Of a General,” said Thénardier, elevating his head.\n\n“Of a Colonel!” repeated Marius in a rage. “I wouldn’t give a ha’penny\nfor a general. And you come here to commit infamies! I tell you that\nyou have committed all crimes. Go! disappear! Only be happy, that is\nall that I desire. Ah! monster! here are three thousand francs more.\nTake them. You will depart to-morrow, for America, with your daughter;\nfor your wife is dead, you abominable liar. I shall watch over your\ndeparture, you ruffian, and at that moment I will count out to you\ntwenty thousand francs. Go get yourself hung elsewhere!”\n\n\n“Monsieur le Baron!” replied Thénardier, bowing to the very earth,\n“eternal gratitude.” And Thénardier left the room, understanding\nnothing, stupefied and delighted with this sweet crushing beneath sacks\nof gold, and with that thunder which had burst forth over his head in\nbank-bills.\n\nStruck by lightning he was, but he was also content; and he would have\nbeen greatly angered had he had a lightning rod to ward off such\nlightning as that.\n\nLet us finish with this man at once.\n\nTwo days after the events which we are at this moment narrating, he set\nout, thanks to Marius’ care, for America under a false name, with his\ndaughter Azelma, furnished with a draft on New York for twenty thousand\nfrancs.\n\nThe moral wretchedness of Thénardier, the bourgeois who had missed his\nvocation, was irremediable. He was in America what he had been in\nEurope. Contact with an evil man sometimes suffices to corrupt a good\naction and to cause evil things to spring from it. With Marius’ money,\nThénardier set up as a slave-dealer.\n\nAs soon as Thénardier had left the house, Marius rushed to the garden,\nwhere Cosette was still walking.\n\n“Cosette! Cosette!” he cried. “Come! come quick! Let us go. Basque, a\ncarriage! Cosette, come. Ah! My God! It was he who saved my life! Let\nus not lose a minute! Put on your shawl.”\n\n\nCosette thought him mad and obeyed.\n\nHe could not breathe, he laid his hand on his heart to restrain its\nthrobbing. He paced back and forth with huge strides, he embraced\nCosette:\n\n“Ah! Cosette! I am an unhappy wretch!” said he.\n\nMarius was bewildered. He began to catch a glimpse in Jean Valjean of\nsome indescribably lofty and melancholy figure. An unheard-of virtue,\nsupreme and sweet, humble in its immensity, appeared to him. The\nconvict was transfigured into Christ.\n\nMarius was dazzled by this prodigy. He did not know precisely what he\nbeheld, but it was grand.\n\nIn an instant, a hackney-carriage stood in front of the door.\n\nMarius helped Cosette in and darted in himself.\n\n“Driver,” said he, “Rue de l’Homme Armé, Number 7.”\n\n\nThe carriage drove off.\n\n“Ah! what happiness!” ejaculated Cosette. “Rue de l’Homme Armé, I did\nnot dare to speak to you of that. We are going to see M. Jean.”\n\n\n“Thy father! Cosette, thy father more than ever. Cosette, I guess it.\nYou told me that you had never received the letter that I sent you by\nGavroche. It must have fallen into his hands. Cosette, he went to the\nbarricade to save me. As it is a necessity with him to be an angel, he\nsaved others also; he saved Javert. He rescued me from that gulf to\ngive me to you. He carried me on his back through that frightful sewer.\nAh! I am a monster of ingratitude. Cosette, after having been your\nprovidence, he became mine. Just imagine, there was a terrible quagmire\nenough to drown one a hundred times over, to drown one in mire.\nCosette! he made me traverse it. I was unconscious; I saw nothing, I\nheard nothing, I could know nothing of my own adventure. We are going\nto bring him back, to take him with us, whether he is willing or not,\nhe shall never leave us again. If only he is at home! Provided only\nthat we can find him, I will pass the rest of my life in venerating\nhim. Yes, that is how it should be, do you see, Cosette? Gavroche must\nhave delivered my letter to him. All is explained. You understand.”\n\n\nCosette did not understand a word.\n\n“You are right,” she said to him.\n\nMeanwhile the carriage rolled on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—A NIGHT BEHIND WHICH THERE IS DAY\n\n\nJean Valjean turned round at the knock which he heard on his door.\n\n“Come in,” he said feebly.\n\nThe door opened.\n\nCosette and Marius made their appearance.\n\nCosette rushed into the room.\n\nMarius remained on the threshold, leaning against the jamb of the door.\n\n“Cosette!” said Jean Valjean.\n\nAnd he sat erect in his chair, his arms outstretched and trembling,\nhaggard, livid, gloomy, an immense joy in his eyes.\n\nCosette, stifling with emotion, fell upon Jean Valjean’s breast.\n\n“Father!” said she.\n\nJean Valjean, overcome, stammered:\n\n“Cosette! she! you! Madame! it is thou! Ah! my God!”\n\n\nAnd, pressed close in Cosette’s arms, he exclaimed:\n\n“It is thou! thou art here! Thou dost pardon me then!”\n\n\nMarius, lowering his eyelids, in order to keep his tears from flowing,\ntook a step forward and murmured between lips convulsively contracted\nto repress his sobs:\n\n“My father!”\n\n\n“And you also, you pardon me!” Jean Valjean said to him.\n\nMarius could find no words, and Jean Valjean added:\n\n“Thanks.”\n\n\nCosette tore off her shawl and tossed her hat on the bed.\n\n“It embarrasses me,” said she.\n\nAnd, seating herself on the old man’s knees, she put aside his white\nlocks with an adorable movement, and kissed his brow.\n\nJean Valjean, bewildered, let her have her own way.\n\nCosette, who only understood in a very confused manner, redoubled her\ncaresses, as though she desired to pay Marius’ debt.\n\nJean Valjean stammered:\n\n“How stupid people are! I thought that I should never see her again.\nImagine, Monsieur Pontmercy, at the very moment when you entered, I was\nsaying to myself: ‘All is over. Here is her little gown, I am a\nmiserable man, I shall never see Cosette again,’ and I was saying that\nat the very moment when you were mounting the stairs. Was not I an\nidiot? Just see how idiotic one can be! One reckons without the good\nGod. The good God says:\n\n“‘You fancy that you are about to be abandoned, stupid! No. No, things\nwill not go so. Come, there is a good man yonder who is in need of an\nangel.’ And the angel comes, and one sees one’s Cosette again! and one\nsees one’s little Cosette once more! Ah! I was very unhappy.”\n\n\nFor a moment he could not speak, then he went on:\n\n“I really needed to see Cosette a little bit now and then. A heart\nneeds a bone to gnaw. But I was perfectly conscious that I was in the\nway. I gave myself reasons: ‘They do not want you, keep in your own\ncourse, one has not the right to cling eternally.’ Ah! God be praised,\nI see her once more! Dost thou know, Cosette, thy husband is very\nhandsome? Ah! what a pretty embroidered collar thou hast on, luckily. I\nam fond of that pattern. It was thy husband who chose it, was it not?\nAnd then, thou shouldst have some cashmere shawls. Let me call her\nthou, Monsieur Pontmercy. It will not be for long.”\n\n\nAnd Cosette began again:\n\n“How wicked of you to have left us like that! Where did you go? Why\nhave you stayed away so long? Formerly your journeys only lasted three\nor four days. I sent Nicolette, the answer always was: ‘He is absent.’\nHow long have you been back? Why did you not let us know? Do you know\nthat you are very much changed? Ah! what a naughty father! he has been\nill, and we have not known it! Stay, Marius, feel how cold his hand\nis!”\n\n\n“So you are here! Monsieur Pontmercy, you pardon me!” repeated Jean\nValjean.\n\nAt that word which Jean Valjean had just uttered once more, all that\nwas swelling Marius’ heart found vent.\n\nHe burst forth:\n\n“Cosette, do you hear? he has come to that! he asks my forgiveness! And\ndo you know what he has done for me, Cosette? He has saved my life. He\nhas done more—he has given you to me. And after having saved me, and\nafter having given you to me, Cosette, what has he done with himself?\nHe has sacrificed himself. Behold the man. And he says to me the\ningrate, to me the forgetful, to me the pitiless, to me the guilty one:\nThanks! Cosette, my whole life passed at the feet of this man would be\ntoo little. That barricade, that sewer, that furnace, that\ncesspool,—all that he traversed for me, for thee, Cosette! He carried\nme away through all the deaths which he put aside before me, and\naccepted for himself. Every courage, every virtue, every heroism, every\nsanctity he possesses! Cosette, that man is an angel!”\n\n\n“Hush! hush!” said Jean Valjean in a low voice. “Why tell all that?”\n\n\n“But you!” cried Marius with a wrath in which there was veneration,\n“why did you not tell it to me? It is your own fault, too. You save\npeople’s lives, and you conceal it from them! You do more, under the\npretext of unmasking yourself, you calumniate yourself. It is\nfrightful.”\n\n\n“I told the truth,” replied Jean Valjean.\n\n“No,” retorted Marius, “the truth is the whole truth; and that you did\nnot tell. You were Monsieur Madeleine, why not have said so? You saved\nJavert, why not have said so? I owed my life to you, why not have said\nso?”\n\n\n“Because I thought as you do. I thought that you were in the right. It\nwas necessary that I should go away. If you had known about that\naffair, of the sewer, you would have made me remain near you. I was\ntherefore forced to hold my peace. If I had spoken, it would have\ncaused embarrassment in every way.”\n\n\n“It would have embarrassed what? embarrassed whom?” retorted Marius.\n“Do you think that you are going to stay here? We shall carry you off.\nAh! good heavens! when I reflect that it was by an accident that I have\nlearned all this. You form a part of ourselves. You are her father, and\nmine. You shall not pass another day in this dreadful house. Do not\nimagine that you will be here to-morrow.”\n\n\n“To-morrow,” said Jean Valjean, “I shall not be here, but I shall not\nbe with you.”\n\n\n“What do you mean?” replied Marius. “Ah! come now, we are not going to\npermit any more journeys. You shall never leave us again. You belong to\nus. We shall not loose our hold of you.”\n\n\n“This time it is for good,” added Cosette. “We have a carriage at the\ndoor. I shall run away with you. If necessary, I shall employ force.”\n\n\nAnd she laughingly made a movement to lift the old man in her arms.\n\n“Your chamber still stands ready in our house,” she went on. “If you\nonly knew how pretty the garden is now! The azaleas are doing very well\nthere. The walks are sanded with river sand; there are tiny violet\nshells. You shall eat my strawberries. I water them myself. And no more\n‘madame,’ no more ‘Monsieur Jean,’ we are living under a Republic,\neverybody says _thou_, don’t they, Marius? The programme is changed. If\nyou only knew, father, I have had a sorrow, there was a robin redbreast\nwhich had made her nest in a hole in the wall, and a horrible cat ate\nher. My poor, pretty, little robin red-breast which used to put her\nhead out of her window and look at me! I cried over it. I should have\nliked to kill the cat. But now nobody cries any more. Everybody laughs,\neverybody is happy. You are going to come with us. How delighted\ngrandfather will be! You shall have your plot in the garden, you shall\ncultivate it, and we shall see whether your strawberries are as fine as\nmine. And, then, I shall do everything that you wish, and then, you\nwill obey me prettily.”\n\n\nJean Valjean listened to her without hearing her. He heard the music of\nher voice rather than the sense of her words; one of those large tears\nwhich are the sombre pearls of the soul welled up slowly in his eyes.\n\nHe murmured:\n\n“The proof that God is good is that she is here.”\n\n\n“Father!” said Cosette.\n\nJean Valjean continued:\n\n“It is quite true that it would be charming for us to live together.\nTheir trees are full of birds. I would walk with Cosette. It is sweet\nto be among living people who bid each other ‘good-day,’ who call to\neach other in the garden. People see each other from early morning. We\nshould each cultivate our own little corner. She would make me eat her\nstrawberries. I would make her gather my roses. That would be charming.\nOnly . . .”\n\n\nHe paused and said gently:\n\n“It is a pity.”\n\n\nThe tear did not fall, it retreated, and Jean Valjean replaced it with\na smile.\n\nCosette took both the old man’s hands in hers.\n\n“My God!” said she, “your hands are still colder than before. Are you\nill? Do you suffer?”\n\n\n“I? No,” replied Jean Valjean. “I am very well. Only . . .”\n\n\nHe paused.\n\n“Only what?”\n\n\n“I am going to die presently.”\n\n\nCosette and Marius shuddered.\n\n“To die!” exclaimed Marius.\n\n“Yes, but that is nothing,” said Jean Valjean.\n\nHe took breath, smiled and resumed:\n\n“Cosette, thou wert talking to me, go on, so thy little robin\nred-breast is dead? Speak, so that I may hear thy voice.”\n\n\nMarius gazed at the old man in amazement.\n\nCosette uttered a heartrending cry.\n\n“Father! my father! you will live. You are going to live. I insist upon\nyour living, do you hear?”\n\n\nJean Valjean raised his head towards her with adoration.\n\n“Oh! yes, forbid me to die. Who knows? Perhaps I shall obey. I was on\nthe verge of dying when you came. That stopped me, it seemed to me that\nI was born again.”\n\n\n“You are full of strength and life,” cried Marius. “Do you imagine that\na person can die like this? You have had sorrow, you shall have no\nmore. It is I who ask your forgiveness, and on my knees! You are going\nto live, and to live with us, and to live a long time. We take\npossession of you once more. There are two of us here who will\nhenceforth have no other thought than your happiness.”\n\n\n“You see,” resumed Cosette, all bathed in tears, “that Marius says that\nyou shall not die.”\n\n\nJean Valjean continued to smile.\n\n“Even if you were to take possession of me, Monsieur Pontmercy, would\nthat make me other than I am? No, God has thought like you and myself,\nand he does not change his mind; it is useful for me to go. Death is a\ngood arrangement. God knows better than we what we need. May you be\nhappy, may Monsieur Pontmercy have Cosette, may youth wed the morning,\nmay there be around you, my children, lilacs and nightingales; may your\nlife be a beautiful, sunny lawn, may all the enchantments of heaven\nfill your souls, and now let me, who am good for nothing, die; it is\ncertain that all this is right. Come, be reasonable, nothing is\npossible now, I am fully conscious that all is over. And then, last\nnight, I drank that whole jug of water. How good thy husband is,\nCosette! Thou art much better off with him than with me.”\n\n\nA noise became audible at the door.\n\nIt was the doctor entering.\n\n“Good-day, and farewell, doctor,” said Jean Valjean. “Here are my poor\nchildren.”\n\n\nMarius stepped up to the doctor. He addressed to him only this single\nword: “Monsieur? . . .” But his manner of pronouncing it contained a\ncomplete question.\n\nThe doctor replied to the question by an expressive glance.\n\n“Because things are not agreeable,” said Jean Valjean, “that is no\nreason for being unjust towards God.”\n\n\nA silence ensued.\n\nAll breasts were oppressed.\n\nJean Valjean turned to Cosette. He began to gaze at her as though he\nwished to retain her features for eternity.\n\nIn the depths of the shadow into which he had already descended,\necstasy was still possible to him when gazing at Cosette. The\nreflection of that sweet face lighted up his pale visage.\n\nThe doctor felt of his pulse.\n\n“Ah! it was you that he wanted!” he murmured, looking at Cosette and\nMarius.\n\nAnd bending down to Marius’ ear, he added in a very low voice:\n\n“Too late.”\n\n\nJean Valjean surveyed the doctor and Marius serenely, almost without\nceasing to gaze at Cosette.\n\nThese barely articulate words were heard to issue from his mouth:\n\n“It is nothing to die; it is dreadful not to live.”\n\n\nAll at once he rose to his feet. These accesses of strength are\nsometimes the sign of the death agony. He walked with a firm step to\nthe wall, thrusting aside Marius and the doctor who tried to help him,\ndetached from the wall a little copper crucifix which was suspended\nthere, and returned to his seat with all the freedom of movement of\nperfect health, and said in a loud voice, as he laid the crucifix on\nthe table:\n\n“Behold the great martyr.”\n\n\nThen his chest sank in, his head wavered, as though the intoxication of\nthe tomb were seizing hold upon him.\n\nHis hands, which rested on his knees, began to press their nails into\nthe stuff of his trousers.\n\nCosette supported his shoulders, and sobbed, and tried to speak to him,\nbut could not.\n\nAmong the words mingled with that mournful saliva which accompanies\ntears, they distinguished words like the following:\n\n“Father, do not leave us. Is it possible that we have found you only to\nlose you again?”\n\n\nIt might be said that agony writhes. It goes, comes, advances towards\nthe sepulchre, and returns towards life. There is groping in the action\nof dying.\n\nJean Valjean rallied after this semi-swoon, shook his brow as though to\nmake the shadows fall away from it and became almost perfectly lucid\nonce more.\n\nHe took a fold of Cosette’s sleeve and kissed it.\n\n“He is coming back! doctor, he is coming back,” cried Marius.\n\n“You are good, both of you,” said Jean Valjean. “I am going to tell you\nwhat has caused me pain. What has pained me, Monsieur Pontmercy, is\nthat you have not been willing to touch that money. That money really\nbelongs to your wife. I will explain to you, my children, and for that\nreason, also, I am glad to see you. Black jet comes from England, white\njet comes from Norway. All this is in this paper, which you will read.\nFor bracelets, I invented a way of substituting for slides of soldered\nsheet iron, slides of iron laid together. It is prettier, better and\nless costly. You will understand how much money can be made in that\nway. So Cosette’s fortune is really hers. I give you these details, in\norder that your mind may be set at rest.”\n\n\nThe portress had come upstairs and was gazing in at the half-open door.\nThe doctor dismissed her.\n\nBut he could not prevent this zealous woman from exclaiming to the\ndying man before she disappeared: “Would you like a priest?”\n\n\n“I have had one,” replied Jean Valjean.\n\nAnd with his finger he seemed to indicate a point above his head where\none would have said that he saw some one.\n\nIt is probable, in fact, that the Bishop was present at this death\nagony.\n\nCosette gently slipped a pillow under his loins.\n\nJean Valjean resumed:\n\n“Have no fear, Monsieur Pontmercy, I adjure you. The six hundred\nthousand francs really belong to Cosette. My life will have been wasted\nif you do not enjoy them! We managed to do very well with those glass\ngoods. We rivalled what is called Berlin jewellery. However, we could\nnot equal the black glass of England. A gross, which contains twelve\nhundred very well cut grains, only costs three francs.”\n\n\nWhen a being who is dear to us is on the point of death, we gaze upon\nhim with a look which clings convulsively to him and which would fain\nhold him back.\n\nCosette gave her hand to Marius, and both, mute with anguish, not\nknowing what to say to the dying man, stood trembling and despairing\nbefore him.\n\nJean Valjean sank moment by moment. He was failing; he was drawing near\nto the gloomy horizon.\n\nHis breath had become intermittent; a little rattling interrupted it.\nHe found some difficulty in moving his forearm, his feet had lost all\nmovement, and in proportion as the wretchedness of limb and feebleness\nof body increased, all the majesty of his soul was displayed and spread\nover his brow. The light of the unknown world was already visible in\nhis eyes.\n\nHis face paled and smiled. Life was no longer there, it was something\nelse.\n\nHis breath sank, his glance grew grander. He was a corpse on which the\nwings could be felt.\n\nHe made a sign to Cosette to draw near, then to Marius; the last minute\nof the last hour had, evidently, arrived.\n\nHe began to speak to them in a voice so feeble that it seemed to come\nfrom a distance, and one would have said that a wall now rose between\nthem and him.\n\n“Draw near, draw near, both of you. I love you dearly. Oh! how good it\nis to die like this! And thou lovest me also, my Cosette. I knew well\nthat thou still felt friendly towards thy poor old man. How kind it was\nof thee to place that pillow under my loins! Thou wilt weep for me a\nlittle, wilt thou not? Not too much. I do not wish thee to have any\nreal griefs. You must enjoy yourselves a great deal, my children. I\nforgot to tell you that the profit was greater still on the buckles\nwithout tongues than on all the rest. A gross of a dozen dozens cost\nten francs and sold for sixty. It really was a good business. So there\nis no occasion for surprise at the six hundred thousand francs,\nMonsieur Pontmercy. It is honest money. You may be rich with a tranquil\nmind. Thou must have a carriage, a box at the theatres now and then,\nand handsome ball dresses, my Cosette, and then, thou must give good\ndinners to thy friends, and be very happy. I was writing to Cosette a\nwhile ago. She will find my letter. I bequeath to her the two\ncandlesticks which stand on the chimney-piece. They are of silver, but\nto me they are gold, they are diamonds; they change candles which are\nplaced in them into wax-tapers. I do not know whether the person who\ngave them to me is pleased with me yonder on high. I have done what I\ncould. My children, you will not forget that I am a poor man, you will\nhave me buried in the first plot of earth that you find, under a stone\nto mark the spot. This is my wish. No name on the stone. If Cosette\ncares to come for a little while now and then, it will give me\npleasure. And you too, Monsieur Pontmercy. I must admit that I have not\nalways loved you. I ask your pardon for that. Now she and you form but\none for me. I feel very grateful to you. I am sure that you make\nCosette happy. If you only knew, Monsieur Pontmercy, her pretty rosy\ncheeks were my delight; when I saw her in the least pale, I was sad. In\nthe chest of drawers, there is a bank-bill for five hundred francs. I\nhave not touched it. It is for the poor. Cosette, dost thou see thy\nlittle gown yonder on the bed? dost thou recognize it? That was ten\nyears ago, however. How time flies! We have been very happy. All is\nover. Do not weep, my children, I am not going very far, I shall see\nyou from there, you will only have to look at night, and you will see\nme smile. Cosette, dost thou remember Montfermeil? Thou wert in the\nforest, thou wert greatly terrified; dost thou remember how I took hold\nof the handle of the water-bucket? That was the first time that I\ntouched thy poor, little hand. It was so cold! Ah! your hands were red\nthen, mademoiselle, they are very white now. And the big doll! dost\nthou remember? Thou didst call her Catherine. Thou regrettedest not\nhaving taken her to the convent! How thou didst make me laugh\nsometimes, my sweet angel! When it had been raining, thou didst float\nbits of straw on the gutters, and watch them pass away. One day I gave\nthee a willow battledore and a shuttlecock with yellow, blue and green\nfeathers. Thou hast forgotten it. Thou wert roguish so young! Thou\ndidst play. Thou didst put cherries in thy ears. Those are things of\nthe past. The forests through which one has passed with one’s child,\nthe trees under which one has strolled, the convents where one has\nconcealed oneself, the games, the hearty laughs of childhood, are\nshadows. I imagined that all that belonged to me. In that lay my\nstupidity. Those Thénardiers were wicked. Thou must forgive them.\nCosette, the moment has come to tell thee the name of thy mother. She\nwas called Fantine. Remember that name—Fantine. Kneel whenever thou\nutterest it. She suffered much. She loved thee dearly. She had as much\nunhappiness as thou hast had happiness. That is the way God apportions\nthings. He is there on high, he sees us all, and he knows what he does\nin the midst of his great stars. I am on the verge of departure, my\nchildren. Love each other well and always. There is nothing else but\nthat in the world: love for each other. You will think sometimes of the\npoor old man who died here. Oh my Cosette, it is not my fault, indeed,\nthat I have not seen thee all this time, it cut me to the heart; I went\nas far as the corner of the street, I must have produced a queer effect\non the people who saw me pass, I was like a madman, I once went out\nwithout my hat. I no longer see clearly, my children, I had still other\nthings to say, but never mind. Think a little of me. Come still nearer.\nI die happy. Give me your dear and well-beloved heads, so that I may\nlay my hands upon them.”\n\n\nCosette and Marius fell on their knees, in despair, suffocating with\ntears, each beneath one of Jean Valjean’s hands. Those august hands no\nlonger moved.\n\nHe had fallen backwards, the light of the candles illuminated him.\n\nHis white face looked up to heaven, he allowed Cosette and Marius to\ncover his hands with kisses.\n\nHe was dead.\n\nThe night was starless and extremely dark. No doubt, in the gloom, some\nimmense angel stood erect with wings outspread, awaiting that soul.\n\n\n  Enlarge\n\nDarkness  5b9-1-darkness\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—THE GRASS COVERS AND THE RAIN EFFACES\n\n\nIn the cemetery of Père-Lachaise, in the vicinity of the common grave,\nfar from the elegant quarter of that city of sepulchres, far from all\nthe tombs of fancy which display in the presence of eternity all the\nhideous fashions of death, in a deserted corner, beside an old wall,\nbeneath a great yew tree over which climbs the wild convolvulus, amid\ndandelions and mosses, there lies a stone. That stone is no more exempt\nthan others from the leprosy of time, of dampness, of the lichens and\nfrom the defilement of the birds. The water turns it green, the air\nblackens it. It is not near any path, and people are not fond of\nwalking in that direction, because the grass is high and their feet are\nimmediately wet. When there is a little sunshine, the lizards come\nthither. All around there is a quivering of weeds. In the spring,\nlinnets warble in the trees.\n\nThis stone is perfectly plain. In cutting it the only thought was the\nrequirements of the tomb, and no other care was taken than to make the\nstone long enough and narrow enough to cover a man.\n\nNo name is to be read there.\n\nOnly, many years ago, a hand wrote upon it in pencil these four lines,\nwhich have become gradually illegible beneath the rain and the dust,\nand which are, to-day, probably effaced:\n\nIl dort. Quoique le sort fût pour lui bien étrange,\nIl vivait. Il mourut quand il n’eut plus son ange.\nLa chose simplement d’elle-même arriva,\nComme la nuit se fait lorsque le jour s’en va.70\n\n\n\nLETTER TO M. DAELLI\n\n\nPublisher of the Italian translation of Les Misérables in Milan.\n\nHAUTEVILLE-HOUSE, October 18, 1862.\n\nYou are right, sir, when you tell me that _Les Misérables_ is written\nfor all nations. I do not know whether it will be read by all, but I\nwrote it for all. It is addressed to England as well as to Spain, to\nItaly as well as to France, to Germany as well as to Ireland, to\nRepublics which have slaves as well as to Empires which have serfs.\nSocial problems overstep frontiers. The sores of the human race, those\ngreat sores which cover the globe, do not halt at the red or blue lines\ntraced upon the map. In every place where man is ignorant and\ndespairing, in every place where woman is sold for bread, wherever the\nchild suffers for lack of the book which should instruct him and of the\nhearth which should warm him, the book of _Les Misérables_ knocks at\nthe door and says: “Open to me, I come for you.”\n\n\nAt the hour of civilization through which we are now passing, and which\nis still so sombre, the _miserable’s_ name is Man; he is agonizing in\nall climes, and he is groaning in all languages.\n\nYour Italy is no more exempt from the evil than is our France. Your\nadmirable Italy has all miseries on the face of it. Does not banditism,\nthat raging form of pauperism, inhabit your mountains? Few nations are\nmore deeply eaten by that ulcer of convents which I have endeavored to\nfathom. In spite of your possessing Rome, Milan, Naples, Palermo,\nTurin, Florence, Sienna, Pisa, Mantua, Bologna, Ferrara, Genoa, Venice,\na heroic history, sublime ruins, magnificent ruins, and superb cities,\nyou are, like ourselves, poor. You are covered with marvels and vermin.\nAssuredly, the sun of Italy is splendid, but, alas, azure in the sky\ndoes not prevent rags on man.\n\nLike us, you have prejudices, superstitions, tyrannies, fanaticisms,\nblind laws lending assistance to ignorant customs. You taste nothing of\nthe present nor of the future without a flavor of the past being\nmingled with it. You have a barbarian, the monk, and a savage, the\nlazzarone. The social question is the same for you as for us. There are\na few less deaths from hunger with you, and a few more from fever; your\nsocial hygiene is not much better than ours; shadows, which are\nProtestant in England, are Catholic in Italy; but, under different\nnames, the _vescovo_ is identical with the _bishop_, and it always\nmeans night, and of pretty nearly the same quality. To explain the\nBible badly amounts to the same thing as to understand the Gospel\nbadly.\n\nIs it necessary to emphasize this? Must this melancholy parallelism be\nyet more completely verified? Have you not indigent persons? Glance\nbelow. Have you not parasites? Glance up. Does not that hideous\nbalance, whose two scales, pauperism and parasitism, so mournfully\npreserve their mutual equilibrium, oscillate before you as it does\nbefore us? Where is your army of schoolmasters, the only army which\ncivilization acknowledges?\n\nWhere are your free and compulsory schools? Does every one know how to\nread in the land of Dante and of Michael Angelo? Have you made public\nschools of your barracks? Have you not, like ourselves, an opulent\nwar-budget and a paltry budget of education? Have not you also that\npassive obedience which is so easily converted into soldierly\nobedience? military establishment which pushes the regulations to the\nextreme of firing upon Garibaldi; that is to say, upon the living honor\nof Italy? Let us subject your social order to examination, let us take\nit where it stands and as it stands, let us view its flagrant offences,\nshow me the woman and the child. It is by the amount of protection with\nwhich these two feeble creatures are surrounded that the degree of\ncivilization is to be measured. Is prostitution less heartrending in\nNaples than in Paris? What is the amount of truth that springs from\nyour laws, and what amount of justice springs from your tribunals? Do\nyou chance to be so fortunate as to be ignorant of the meaning of those\ngloomy words: public prosecution, legal infamy, prison, the scaffold,\nthe executioner, the death penalty? Italians, with you as with us,\nBeccaria is dead and Farinace is alive. And then, let us scrutinize\nyour state reasons. Have you a government which comprehends the\nidentity of morality and politics? You have reached the point where you\ngrant amnesty to heroes! Something very similar has been done in\nFrance. Stay, let us pass miseries in review, let each one contribute\nhis pile, you are as rich as we. Have you not, like ourselves, two\ncondemnations, religious condemnation pronounced by the priest, and\nsocial condemnation decreed by the judge? Oh, great nation of Italy,\nthou resemblest the great nation of France! Alas! our brothers, you\nare, like ourselves, _Miserables_.\n\nFrom the depths of the gloom wherein you dwell, you do not see much\nmore distinctly than we the radiant and distant portals of Eden. Only,\nthe priests are mistaken. These holy portals are before and not behind\nus.\n\nI resume. This book, _Les Misérables_, is no less your mirror than\nours. Certain men, certain castes, rise in revolt against this book,—I\nunderstand that. Mirrors, those revealers of the truth, are hated; that\ndoes not prevent them from being of use.\n\nAs for myself, I have written for all, with a profound love for my own\ncountry, but without being engrossed by France more than by any other\nnation. In proportion as I advance in life, I grow more simple, and I\nbecome more and more patriotic for humanity.\n\nThis is, moreover, the tendency of our age, and the law of radiance of\nthe French Revolution; books must cease to be exclusively French,\nItalian, German, Spanish, or English, and become European, I say more,\nhuman, if they are to correspond to the enlargement of civilization.\n\nHence a new logic of art, and of certain requirements of composition\nwhich modify everything, even the conditions, formerly narrow, of taste\nand language, which must grow broader like all the rest.\n\nIn France, certain critics have reproached me, to my great delight,\nwith having transgressed the bounds of what they call “French taste”; I\nshould be glad if this eulogium were merited.\n\nIn short, I am doing what I can, I suffer with the same universal\nsuffering, and I try to assuage it, I possess only the puny forces of a\nman, and I cry to all: “Help me!”\n\n\nThis, sir, is what your letter prompts me to say; I say it for you and\nfor your country. If I have insisted so strongly, it is because of one\nphrase in your letter. You write:—\n\n“There are Italians, and they are numerous, who say: ‘This book, _Les\nMisérables_, is a French book. It does not concern us. Let the French\nread it as a history, we read it as a romance.’”—Alas! I repeat,\nwhether we be Italians or Frenchmen, misery concerns us all. Ever since\nhistory has been written, ever since philosophy has meditated, misery\nhas been the garment of the human race; the moment has at length\narrived for tearing off that rag, and for replacing, upon the naked\nlimbs of the Man-People, the sinister fragment of the past with the\ngrand purple robe of the dawn.\n\nIf this letter seems to you of service in enlightening some minds and\nin dissipating some prejudices, you are at liberty to publish it, sir.\nAccept, I pray you, a renewed assurance of my very distinguished\nsentiments.\n\nVICTOR HUGO.\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n\n\n\n1 (return) [ Patois of the French Alps: _chat de maraude_, rascally\nmarauder.]\n\n\n\n2 (return) [ Liège: a cork-tree.

When, by adding your age to my age, we could not\ncount forty years between us, and when, in our humble and tiny\nhousehold, everything was spring to us even in winter. Fair days!\nManuel was proud and wise, Paris sat at sacred banquets, Foy launched\nthunderbolts, and your corsage had a pin on which I pricked myself.\nEverything gazed upon you. A briefless lawyer, when I took you to the\nPrado to dine, you were so beautiful that the roses seemed to me to\nturn round, and I heard them say: Is she not beautiful! How good she\nsmells! What billowing hair! Beneath her mantle she hides a wing. Her\ncharming bonnet is hardly unfolded. I wandered with thee, pressing thy\nsupple arm. The passers-by thought that love bewitched had wedded, in\nour happy couple, the gentle month of April to the fair month of May.\nWe lived concealed, content, with closed doors, devouring love, that\nsweet forbidden fruit. My mouth had not uttered a thing when thy heart\nhad already responded. The Sorbonne was the bucolic spot where I adored\nthee from eve till morn. ‘Tis thus that an amorous soul applies the\nchart of the Tender to the Latin country. O Place Maubert! O Place\nDauphine! When in the fresh spring-like hut thou didst draw thy\nstocking on thy delicate leg, I saw a star in the depths of the garret.\nI have read a great deal of Plato, but nothing of it remains by me;\nbetter than Malebranche and then Lamennais thou didst demonstrate to me\ncelestial goodness with a flower which thou gavest to me, I obeyed\nthee, thou didst submit to me; oh gilded garret! to lace thee! to\nbehold thee going and coming from dawn in thy chemise, gazing at thy\nyoung brow in thine ancient mirror! And who, then, would forego the\nmemory of those days of aurora and the firmament, of flowers, of gauze\nand of moire, when love stammers a charming slang? Our gardens\nconsisted of a pot of tulips; thou didst mask the window with thy\npetticoat; I took the earthenware bowl and I gave thee the Japanese\ncup. And those great misfortunes which made us laugh! Thy cuff\nscorched, thy boa lost! And that dear portrait of the divine\nShakespeare which we sold one evening that we might sup! I was a beggar\nand thou wert charitable. I kissed thy fresh round arms in haste. A\nfolio Dante served us as a table on which to eat merrily a centime’s\nworth of chestnuts. The first time that, in my joyous den, I snatched a\nkiss from thy fiery lip, when thou wentest forth, dishevelled and\nblushing, I turned deathly pale and I believed in God. Dost thou recall\nour innumerable joys, and all those fichus changed to rags? Oh! what\nsighs from our hearts full of gloom fluttered forth to the heavenly\ndepths!]\n\n\n\n54 (return) [ My nose is in tears, my friend Bugeaud, lend me thy\ngendarmes that I may say a word to them.

The jades are very charming, their poison\nwhich bewitched me would intoxicate Monsieur Orfila. I’m fond of love\nand its bickerings, I love Agnes, I love Pamela, Lise burned herself in\nsetting me aflame. In former days when I saw the mantillas of Suzette\nand of Zéila, my soul mingled with their folds. Love, when thou\ngleamest in the dark thou crownest Lola with roses, I would lose my\nsoul for that. Jeanne, at thy mirror thou deckest thyself! One fine\nday, my heart flew forth. I think that it is Jeanne who has it. At\nnight, when I come from the quadrilles, I show Stella to the stars, and\nI say to them: “Behold her.” Where fair maids go, lon la.]\n\n\n\n57 (return) [ But some prisons still remain, and I am going to put a\nstop to this sort of public order.
