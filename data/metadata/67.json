Previously, it emphasized how the various immigrant\ngroups in America shed their divergent heritages and amalgamated into a\nnew nationality. More recently, scholars and laymen alike have become\nmore sensitive to the ways in which these newcomers have kept aspects\nfrom their past alive, and there is a new awareness of the degree to\nwhich ethnicity continues as a force within America.\n\nMost of the original settlers were British, Protestant, and white. Many\nof the later arrivals differed from them, in one or more ways. History\nbooks usually depicted these new waves of immigrants as assimilating\nalmost fully into American society.  However, recent writings have put\nmore stress on the ethnic diversities which remain and on the rich\nvariety of contributions which were made to the American scene by each\nnew nationality.\n\nThis volume depicts the immigrants from Africa as one among the many\nelements which created present-day America. On the one hand, they differ\nfrom the other minorities because they came involuntarily, suffered the\ncruelties of slavery, and were of another color. All of this made their\nexperience unique. On the other hand, they shared much in common with the\nother minorities, many of whom also felt like aliens in their new land.\n\nThroughout most of American history, political power has been held\ntightly by the white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant majority.  Historical\npresentations which stressed the political component, thereby tended to\nleave the later immigrants in the background.  However, because these\nnewcomers did not assimilate fully into the mainstream of America, they\nmaintained some of their ethnic identity and made fresh and unique\ncontributions to American life.  A socio-cultural approach to history,\nthrough highlighting society and culture rather than politics, brings\nthese minorities into proper focus.\n\nThis study of Afro-Americans seeks to describe the character and culture\nwhich they produced for themselves in America. It also points to the many\nimportant contributions which they have made to American cultural life.\nThe spotlight is on what they felt and thought, on the attitudes they\ndeveloped, and on their increasingly vocal protests against the unfair\ntreatment which they believed was directed at them.\n\nBesides taking a socio-cultural approach to the subject, this book is\ndeliberately interpretive rather than being merely a narrative of events.\nIt is reasonably brief in the hope that it will appeal to interested\nlaymen. At the same time, it contains a number of footnotes so that\neither scholars or laymen, wanting to check their thoughts against the\ninterpretation presented here, can readily use this book as a guide to\nfurther reading. (Note the footnotes are not in this electronic version.)\n\nIf at times the treatment of the white majority seems harsh, it is\nbecause, in my opinion, it is still necessary for Americans to take a\nlong, cold look at the chilling facts which have too often been ignored.\nYet, times and people do change. Race relations in America are not today\nwhat they were a century ago. The progress of history may not be the wide\nhighway moving steadily and smoothly upward as many have believed, but\nthe racial picture in America has altered and will continue to do\nso--sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse.  Nevertheless, it\nis only by knowing ourselves that we can intelligently face our crises. I\nhope that this volume will assist the reader as he struggles with this\ndifficult task.\n\nNorman Coombs\n  September, 1971\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation to the National Endowment\nfor the Arts and Humanities and to the Rochester Institute of Technology\nfor providing me with much of the time which made this research possible.\nI am also indebted to Professors Benjamin Quarles and Merle Curti for\nkindly reading and commenting on the manuscript.

C.\n\n\n\nPART ONE   From Freedom to Slavery\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nAfrican Origins\n\n\nThe Human Cradle\n\nTHREE and a half centuries of immigration have injected ever-fresh doses\nof energy and tension into the American bloodstream. As diverse peoples\nlearned to live together, they became a dynamo generating both creativity\nand conflict. One of the most diverse elements in American life was\nintroduced when Africans were forcibly brought to the American colonies.\nThe American experiment had begun and consisted mainly of white men with\na European heritage. The African was of a different color, had a\ndifferent language, a different religion, and had an entirely different\nworld view. But perhaps the most striking contrast was that, while the\nEuropean came voluntarily in search of greater individual opportunity,\nthe African came in chains. Because the European was the master and\nthereby the superior in the relationship, he assumed that his heritage\nwas also superior.  However, he was mistaken, because the African had a\nrich heritage of importance both to himself and to mankind. When people\ninteract intimately over a long period of time, the influences are\nreciprocal. This is true even when their relationship is that of master\nand slave.\n\nTo trace the importance of the African heritage one must go back millions\nof years. Evidence is accumulating to the effect that Africa is the\ncradle of mankind. Professor Louis Leakey argues that Africa was\nimportant in the development of mankind in three ways. First, some thirty\nor forty million years ago, the basic stock which eventually gave rise to\nboth man and the ape came into existence in the vicinity of the Nile\nValley. Second, some twelve or fourteen million years ago, the main\nbranch which was to lead to the development of man broke away from the\nbranch leading to the ape. Third, about two million years ago, in the\nvicinity of East Africa, true man broke away from his now extinct manlike\ncousins.  The present species of man-Homo Sapiens--developed through a\ncomplex process of natural selection from a large number of different\nmanlike creatures-hominids.\n\nOne of the most numerous of the early hominids was Australopithecus\nAfricanus who originated in Africa. Although he also did some hunting, he\nlived mainly by collecting and eating vegetables. One of the things that\nidentified him as a man was his utilization of primitive tools. He had a\npointed stone which may have been used to sharpen sticks, and these\nsticks were probably used for digging roots to augment his food supply.\nLeakey believes that Homo Habilis, who lived in East Africa about two\nmillion years ago, was the immediate ancestor of man and the most\nadvanced of all the hominids. Although the hominids spread far outside of\nAfrica, it is clear that they originate  there and that it was in Africa\nthat true man first emerged. As Darwin predicted a century ago, Africa\nhas been found to be the father of mankind.\n\nFor many thousands of years, Homo Sapiens and the other hominids lived\nside by side in Africa as elsewhere. By ten thousand years ago, however,\nall the hominids had disappeared.  Scholars believe that this was the\nresult of the gradual absorption of all the other hominids by the more\nbiologically advanced Homo Sapiens. This process may explain the\nappearance of variations within Homo Sapiens. At various times and\nplaces, as Homo Sapiens absorbed other hominid strains, differences\nwithin Homo Sapiens developed. In any case it is clear that the various\ntypes of man came into existence very early. In Africa, this process led\nto the development of three main types: the brownish-yellow Bushmen in\nthe south, the darker Negroes throughout most of the continent and the\nCaucasoid Mediterranean types in the north.\n\nMost of the concepts, held even by scholars about the nature and origin\nof races, are being proven inaccurate. Anthropological literature used to\nsuggest that skin color in some groups was a possible indication of\nMongoloid influences or that the thin, straight lips common in another\ngroup could be envisioned as a Caucasoid feature. However, it has become\nincreasingly obvious that an analysis based on specific single traits\nsuch as these is always a poor indication of either racial origin or of\nracial contact.  In fact, they could just as likely be the result of\nspontaneous and local variations within a given population grouping. In\ncontrast, recent anthropological research is putting less emphasis on\nbone measurement and shape and, instead, is turning increasingly to\ntechnical analysis particularly through the examination of blood types.\n\nMaking and using tools are what differentiate man from animals. The\nearliest tools which have survived the wear of time were made of stone.\nAs man's techniques of handling stone improved, so did his tools. The\nhand axe, a large oval of chipped flint varying in size and weight, came\ninto common usage about half a million years ago, and it has been found\nin much of Europe, Asia, and Africa. This too seems to have had an\nAfrican origin.  While scholars are not certain about its use, it was\nprobably used for killing animals and for chopping meat.\n\nThe first achievement which radically altered man's condition was the\ninvention of tools. The second achievement was his learning of primitive\nagriculture which transformed the hunter into the farmer. The\ndomestication of animals and the planting and cultivating of crops had\nbegun in the Near East, but the practice shortly spread to the Nile\nValley in Northeast Africa. At the same time, farming communities sprang\nup throughout the Sahara which, at that time, was going through one of\nits wet phases. This made it well-suited to early agriculture.  Farming\npermitted men to live together in communities and to pursue a more\nsedentary way of life. Actually, some Africans had already adopted a\nsedentary community life before the arrival of farming. Making hooks from\nbones led to the development of a few fishing communities near\npresent-day Kenya.\n\nAs the communities along the Nile grew in size and number, society began\nto develop a complex urban civilization. By 3,200 B.C.  the communities\nalong the Nile had become politically united under the first of a line of\ngreat pharaohs. These early Egyptians undoubtedly were comprised of a\nracial mixture. The ancient Greeks viewed the Egyptians as being dark in\ncomplexion, and it has been estimated that the Egyptian population at the\nbeginning was at least one-third Negro.  Herodotus says that it was\nimpossible to tell whether the influence of the Egyptians on the\nEthiopians was stronger than that of the Ethiopians on the Egyptians.\n\nWhat Herodotus and the Greeks referred to as Ethiopia was, in fact, the\nkingdom of Kush. It was located up the Nile from Egypt.  As the Egyptian\nempire grew in strength and wealth, it strove to expand its power over\nits neighbors. Egypt sent several military expeditions south along the\nNile to try to conquer the black people of Kush. They failed and the\nKushites, in turn, endeavored to extend their power over Egypt.  In 751\nB.C., Kush invaded Egypt and, shortly thereafter, conquered it.  This\noccupation of Egypt lasted for over a hundred years, until both the\nKushites and the Egyptians were defeated by an invading army from Assyria\nin 666 B.C. At that point, the Kushites returned to the safety of their\nhomeland.\n\nThe Kushites and the Egyptians had been defeated by a superior\ntechnology. While they were fighting with weapons made of copper and\nbronze, the Assyrians fought with iron. Methods of smelting and working\niron had been developed centuries before by the Hittites who lived in\nAsia Minor. The use of iron spread across the Near East, becoming the\nbasis for the Assyrian power. After their defeat in 666 B.C., the\nKushites and the Egyptians rapidly adopted the new iron technology. The\ncoming of the Iron Age to Africa meant the production of better weapons\nand tools. Better weapons provided safety from hostile foes and\nprotection from ferocious beasts. Better axes meant that man could live\nin densely forested regions where he had not been able to live before.\nBetter farm implements meant that more food could be grown with less\nwork, this again encouraged the development of denser population centers.\n\nBy 300 B.C., Kush had become an important iron-producing center. Its\ncapital, Meroe located on the upper Nile, developed into a thriving\ncommercial and industrial city. Archeological diggings have unearthed the\nremains of streets, houses, sprawling palaces, and huge piles of slag\nleft from its iron industry. When scholars are able to decipher the\nKushitic writings much more will be known about the culture and way of\nlife of this early black empire.  In the first century A.D. a Kushite\nofficial, whom the Bible refers to as the Ethiopian eunuch, was converted\nto Christianity by the apostle Philip while returning from a visit to\nJerusalem. Shortly, Christianity spread throughout the entire kingdom.\nWhen Kush was defeated by the Axumites, founders of modern Ethiopia,\nseveral smaller Nubian, Christian kingdoms survived. Not until the\nsixteenth century, after almost a thousand years of pressure, did Islam\ngain supremacy in western Sudan. Ethiopia, shortly after defeating Kush,\nalso became Christianized, and survived as a African only  Christian\nisland in a Moslem sea. In fact, Ethiopia has remained an independent,\nself-governing state until the present, with the brief exception of the\nItalian occupation between 1936 and 1941.\n\nThe development of man and civilization in Africa was not limited merely\nto the area in the Northeast. There is much evidence of cultural contact\nbetween people in all parts of the continent. When the Sahara began to\ndry out about 2000 B.C., the population was pushed out from there in all\ndirections, thereby forcing the spread of both people and cultures. Even\nthen, the Sahara did not become a block to communication as has been\nthought. There is clear evidence that trade routes continued to be used\neven after the Sahara became a desert. Scholars also have found that,\nshortly after the Iron Age reached North Africa, iron tools began to\nappear throughout the entire continent, and, within few centuries, iron\nproduction was being carried on at a number of different locations. At\nabout the same time, sailors from the far East brought the yam and the\nbanana to the shores of Africa.  These fruits spread rapidly from the\neast coast across most of the continent, becoming basic staples in the\nAfrican diet. New tools and new crops rapidly expanded the food supply\nand thereby provided a better way of life.\n\n\nWest African Empires\n\nAlthough West Africa had been inhabited since the earliest times, about\ntwo thousand years ago several events occurred which injected new vigor\ninto the area. The first event had been the drying of the Sahara, which\nhad driven new immigrants into West Africa and, from the admixture of\nthese new people with the previous inhabitants, a new vitality developed.\nThen, the introduction of the yam and the banana, as previously noted,\nsignificantly increased the food supply. Finally, the developments of\niron tools and of iron work further increased the food supply and also\nprovided better weapons. This permitted increased military power and\npolitical expansion. These were the necessary ingredients that led to the\nbuilding of three large and powerful empires: Ghana, Mali and Songhay.\nCommerce was another factor which contributed to their development.\nGovernmental control of a thriving trade in both gold and salt provided\nthe wealth and power necessary for establishing these large empires.\n\nUnfortunately, our knowledge about West Africa's early history is\nseverely limited by the lack of written records from that period.  In\nrecent years, archaeologists have been unearthing increasing amounts of\nmaterial which contribute to our knowledge of early Africa. West Africans\ntended to build their cities from nondurable materials such as wood, mud,\nand grass. The area does have a rich oral tradition, including special\ngroups of trained men dedicated to its development and maintenance. As\noral history is always open to modification and embellishment, with no\nmeans available for checking the original version, this material must be\nused cautiously. Nevertheless, when employed in conjunction with other\nsources, it does provide a rich source of information.\n\nThe earliest written records were provided by the Arabs who developed\nclose contact with West Africa by 800 A.D. After that, West Africans\nbegan using Arabic themselves to record their own history. In the middle\nof the fifteenth century, Europeans began regular contact with West\nAfrica, and they left a wide variety of written sources. While most of\nthese early Europeans were not men of learning, many of their records are\nstill valuable to the student of history.\n\nGhana was already a powerful empire, with a highly complex political and\nsocial organization, when the Arabs reached it about 800 A.D. An Arabic\nmap of 830 A.D. has Ghana marked on it, and other contemporary Arabic\nsources refer to Ghana as the land of gold. From this time on, a thriving\ntrade developed between Ghana and the world of Islam, including the\nbeginnings of a slave trade.  However, this early slave trade was a\ntwo-way affair. Al-Bakri, a contemporary Arab writer, was impressed with\nthe display of power and affluence of the Ghanaian king.  According to\nhim, the king had an army of two hundred thousand warriors which included\nabout forty thousand men with bows and arrows. (Modern scholars know that\nthe real power of the Ghanaian army was due not to its large numbers as\nmuch as to its iron-pointed spears.) Al-Bakri also described an official\naudience at the royal palace in which the king, the Ghana, was surrounded\nby lavish trappings of gold and silver and was attended by many pages,\nservants, large numbers of faithful officials, provincial rulers, and\nmayors of cities. On such occasions, the king heard the grievances of his\npeople and passed judgment on them. Al-Bakri also describes lavish royal\nbanquets which included a great deal of ceremonial ritual.\n\nThe power of the king, and therefore of the empire, was based on his\nability to maintain law and order in his kingdom. This provided the\ndevelopment of a flourishing commerce, and it was by taxing all imports\nand exports that the king was able to finance his government. The key\nitem in this financial structure was the regulation of the vast gold\nresources of West Africa, and it was by controlling its availability that\nthe king was also able to manipulate its value. However, after the\neleventh century, the Ghanaian empire was continually exposed to\nharassment from a long series of Arabic holy wars. Over a long period of\ntime, the power of the king was reduced until the empire of Ghana finally\ncollapsed. From its ashes emerged the basis for the creation of a new and\neven larger empire: the empire of Mali.\n\nMali, like Ghana, was built on gold. While Ghana had been under attack by\nthe Arabs from outside, various peoples from within struck for their own\nfreedom. The Mandinka people, who had been the middlemen in the gold\ntrade and who had received protection from the king of Ghana, achieved\ntheir independence in 1230 A.D.  They went on to use their position in\nthe gold trade to build an empire of their own. The peak of their\ninfluence and power was achieved in the early fourteenth century under\nMansa Kankan Musa who ruled Mali for a quarter of a century. He extended\nits boundaries beyond those of Ghana to include such important trading\ncities as Timbuktu and Gao, encompassing an area larger than that\ncontrolled by the European monarchs of that day. This empire also was\nbased on its ability to provide stable government and a flourishing\neconomy. An Arab traveler, Ibn Batuta, shortly after Musa's death, found\ncomplete safety of travel throughout the entire empire of Mali.\n\nMansa Musa and, for that matter, the entire ruling class of Mali had\nconverted to Islam. This intensified the contacts between West Africa and\nthe Islamic world. Although several of these kings made pilgrimages to\nMecca, the most spectacular was the one by Mansa Musa in 1324. On his way\nthere, he made a prolonged visit to Cairo. While there, both his\ngenerosity in giving lavish gifts of gold to its citizens and his\nextravagant spending poured so much gold into the Cairo market that it\ncaused a general inflation. It was estimated by the Arabs that his\ncaravan included some sixty thousand people and some five hundred\npersonal slaves. Mansa Musa took a number of Arabic scholars and skilled\nartisans  back to West Africa with him. These scholars enhanced the\nuniversity of Timbuktu which was already widely known as a center of\nIslamic studies. Now, besides exchanging material goods, West Africa and\nthe Arabs became involved in a steady exchange of scholars and learning.\n\nThe success of Mali in bringing law and order to a large portion of West\nAfrica was responsible for its decline. Having experienced the advantages\nof political organization, many localities sought self-government. In\nfact, Mansa Musa had overextended the empire.  A skilled ruler like\nhimself could manipulate it, but those who followed were not adequate to\nthe challenge. Movements for self-government gradually eroded central\nauthority until by 1500 Mali had lost its importance as an empire.\nAlthough the period of its power and prosperity was respectable by most\nworld empire standards, it was short-lived compared to the history of the\nprevious empire of Ghana.  Again, a new empire was to emerge from the\nruins of the previous one.\n\nThe Songhay empire was based on the strength of the important trading\ncity of Gao. This city won its independence from Mali as early as 1375,\nand, within a century, it had developed into an empire.  Songhay carried\non a vigorous trade with the outside world and particularly with the\nArabic countries. The ruling class, in particular, continued to follow\nthe religion of Islam, but it is generally believed that the masses of\nthe population remained faithful to the more traditional West African\nreligions based on fetishism and ancestor worship.  Two of the more\npowerful rulers were Suni Ali, who began his 28-year reign in 1464, and\nAskia Mohammed, who began his 36-year reign in 1493. Askia Mohammed was\nalso known as Askia the Great. The security of Songhay was undermined\nwhen Arabs from Morocco invaded and captured the key trading city of\nTimbuktu in 1591. Thus ended the last of the three great empires of West\nAfrica.\n\nIt would be a mistake, however, to assume that those parts of West Africa\nwhich remained outside of these three empires fulfilled the usual\nEuropean image of primitive savagery. On the contrary, a number of other\nsmall yet powerful states existed throughout the entire period. If this\nhad not been so, the Europeans, as they arrived in the fifteenth century,\ncould have pillaged West Africa at will. Instead, the Europeans were only\nable to establish trading stations where local kings permitted it. With\nthe exception of a few raiding parties which seized Africans and carried\nthem off as slaves, most slave acquisition was done through hard\nbargaining and a highly systematized trading process. The Europeans were\nnever allowed to penetrate inland, and they found that they always had to\ntreat the African kings and their agents as business equals. Many of the\nearly European visitors, in fact, were impressed by the luxury, power,\ntrading practices, skilled crafts, and the complex social structure which\nthey found in Africa. Only in some parts of East Africa, where the states\nwere unusually small, were the Portuguese able to pillage and conquer at\nwill.  While many Europeans may have thought of Africa as being filled\nwith ignorant savages, those who reached its shores were impressed\ninstead with its vigorous civilization.\n\n\nThe Culture of West Africa\n\nAn African should not have to find it necessary to make apologies for his\ncivilization. However, Europeans and Americans have come to believe, at\nleast in their subconscious minds, that civilization can be equated with\nprogress in science and technology. Because the Africans lagged far\nbehind the Europeans in the arts of war and of economic exploitation, the\nEuropeans believed at the Africans must be uncivilized savages. Africa,\nlike the rest of the world outside Europe, had not made the break-through\nin science, technology, and capitalism which had occurred in Europe.\nNevertheless, they had their own systems of economics, scholarship, art,\nand religion as well as a highly complex social and political structure.\nThere are common elements which run throughout the entire continent of\nAfrica, but to gain the best insight into the background of the American\nslaves, West African culture can be isolated and studied by itself.\n\nThe West African economy was a subsistence economy, and therefore people\nwere basically satisfied with the status quo and saw no point in\naccumulating wealth. Also in a subsistence economy, there is little need\nfor money, and most trade was done through barter. Because there was no\nmoney, there was no wage labor.  Instead, labor was created either\nthrough a system of domestic slavery or through a complex system of\nreciprocal duties and obligations. However, West African slavery was more\nlike the European system of serfdom than it was like modern slavery.\n\nWithin this subsistence economy, each tribe or locality tended to\nspecialize in certain fields of agriculture or manufacture which\nnecessitated a vigorous and constant trade between all of them.  However,\nwithin the trading centers, money had come into regular use.  It usually\ntook the form of cowrie shells, iron bars, brass rings, or other standard\nitems of value. Systems of banking and credit had also been developed,\nbut even those involved in money, banking, and trade had a noncapitalist\nattitude towards wealth.  They enjoyed luxury and the display of\naffluence, but they had no concept of investing capital to increase\noverall production.\n\nWest Africa also carried on a vigorous trade with the outside world.\nWhen the Europeans arrived, they discovered, as had the Arabs before\nthem, that the West Africans could strike a hard bargain. They had\ndeveloped their own systems of weights and measures and insisted on using\nthem. Europeans who failed to treat the king or his agent fairly, found\nthat the Africans simply refused to deal with them again. Trade was\nalways monopolized by the king, and he appointed specific merchants to\ndeal with foreign businessmen. As previously noted, it was by the control\nand taxation of commerce That the king financed his government and\nmaintained his power.\n\nThe strength and weaknesses of the West African economy can be seen by a\ncursory glance at a list of its main exports and imports.  West African\nexports included gold, ivory, hides, leather goods, cotton, peppercorn,\nolive oil, and cola.  While some of these items were only exported for\nshort distances, others found their way over long distances. West African\ngold, for example, was exported as far away as Asia and Northern Europe.\nSome English coins of the period were minted with West African gold. West\nAfrican imports included silks from Asia, swords, knives, kitchen-ware,\nand trinkets from the primitive industrial factories of Europe as well as\nhorses and other items from Arabia. Two other items of trade became all\nimportant for the future--the exportation of slaves and the importation\nof guns and gunpowder.\n\nWest African manufacturing demonstrated a considerable amount of skill in\na wide variety of crafts. These included basket-weaving, pottery making,\nwoodworking and iron-working. Archeological evidence shows that West\nAfricans were making pottery and terracotta sculpture as much as two\nthousand years ago.  Three-dimensional forms seem to have held a\nparticular interest for West African artists. During the last century,\nart critics have  gone beyond considering this art as \"primitive\" and\nhave begun to appreciate its aesthetic qualities. In fact, in recent\nyears, African art has had considerable influence on contemporary artists.\n\nThe two forms of African art best known outside Africa are music and the\ndance. African music contrasts with European music in its use of a\ndifferent scale and in concentrating less on melodic development and more\non the creation of complex and subtle rhythmic patterns. Musicians used\nto view African music as simple and undeveloped, but now musicologists\nadmit that African rhythms are more complex and highly developed than\nrhythms in European music. Africans like to sing and to develop songs for\nall occasions: religious songs, work songs, and songs for leisure.\nAfrican singing is also marked by the frequent use of a leader and a\nchorus response technique. African dance, like its music, builds on\nhighly complex rhythmic patterns. It too is closely related to all parts\nof the African's daily life. There are dances for social and for ritual\noccasions. The most common use of the dance was as an integral part of\nAfrican religious rites.\n\nAfrican religion has usually been defined as fetish worship-the belief\nthat specific inanimate objects are inhabited by spirits endowed with\nmagical powers. While this view of African religion is partly true, it\nobscures more than it clarifies. The fetish is believed to have some\npowers of its own, but, in general, it derived them from its close\nassociation with a dead ancestor. Behind the fetish was the religion of\nancestor worship, and the fetish is better understood as a religious\nsymbol. Ancestor worship was also part of the African's strong family\nties and his powerful kinship patterns.  Behind the realm of this fetish\nand ancestor worship lay another world of distant and powerful deities\nwho had control over the elemental natural forces of the universe. While\nthis religion might be described as primitive, it cannot be viewed as\nsimplistic. It involved a series of complex ideas about fetishes,\nancestors, and deities which required a high degree of intelligence.\n\nThe intricacies of theology, law, medicine, and politics made it\nnecessary to develop a complex system of oral education. Europeans, who\ntended to identify knowledge with writing, had long assumed that, because\nthere was no written language in early Africa, there could be no body of\nknowledge. After the arrival of Islam, Arabic provided a written form\nwithin which West African ideas could be set down.\n\nOnly recently have scholars become aware of the libraries and the many\npublications to be found in West Africa. Two of these books were\nresponsible for providing historians with detailed information about the\ncustoms and social structure of the area. One was the Tarikh al-Fattiish,\nthe chronicle of the seeker after knowledge, written by Mahmud Kati in\nthe early fifteenth century.  The other was the Tarikh al-Sudan, the\nchronicle of the Western Sudan, written by Abd al-Rahman as-Sadi about\nthe beginning of the seventeenth century.\n\nThe society of West Africa was stratified in several different ways. It\nwas divided in terms of differing occupations: farmers, merchants,\npriests, scholars, laborers, and a wide variety of craftsmen. The social\nranking assigned to these occupation divisions varied according to the\nimportance of each occupation.\n\nSociety was also divided in terms of clans, families, and villages.  At\nthe same time, there was a hierarchical division based on the varying\ndegrees of political power each group exercised within its society.  Some\nhad the power to become chiefs and rulers. Some had the right to choose\nand depose rulers, and others could limit and define the rights of the\nrulers. However, almost everywhere there was a clear trend toward\nincreasing centralized authority and decreasing popular participation.\nThe centralization of power in West Africa never reached the extremes of\nabsolute monarchy which occurred in Europe, and there was never the same\nneed for revolutionary social changes to revive democratic participation\nwithin African society.\n\nIn an old Asante ritual, connected with the enthronement of a ruler, the\npeople pray that their ruler should not be greedy, should not be hard of\nhearing, should not act on his own initiative nor perpetuate personal\nabuse nor commit violence on his people, While the right to rule was\ngenerally passed on from generation to generation within a single family,\nthe power did not immediately and automatically fall on the eldest son\nwithin that family.  Instead, another family had the power to select the\nnext ruler from among a large number of potential candidates within the\nruling family. If the ruler who was selected ruled unwisely and unfairly,\nhe could also be deposed. Here was a distinct limitation on royal\nabsolutism.\n\nIn a similar way, there were limitations on the centralization of\neconomic power. While valuable land in Europe had been captured and\ncontrolled by private ownership and was the possession of a powerful\nminority, land in West Africa still belonged to the community. A powerful\nfamily had the right to control and supervise the use of the land for the\nwelfare of the community, and, undoubtedly, this power could be misused.\nSuch a family assigned land to its users along with certain tenure\nsafeguards which operated to limit even the power of the family. Those\nusing the land who did not fulfill their obligations to the community by\nutilizing it properly and wisely, could have the land taken away from\nthem. It might then be given to someone else. Both in economics and in\npolitics, historical custom and precedent has limited minority power and\nhas protected the welfare of the community.  Nevertheless, community\npower and wealth has come to be divided into two major divisions: the\nrich and powerful few and the poor and powerless majority. Though the\nelite ruled and the masses served, rights and obligations which limited\nthe amount of exploitation were always in existence.\n\nOne of the signs of the trend toward the increasing centralization of\npower within the society of West Africa was the development of a\nprofessional army. The gigantic armies of Ghana had been conscripted from\nthe common citizenry. As the ruling class in West Africa adopted Islam\nand as its desire to increase its power continued to undermine local\ntradition and custom, there was more need for a professional army which\nwould owe its total allegiance to the ruler.\n\nAlso, changes in military technology required a skilled and carefully\ntrained army. Horses were expensive and could only be used efficiently by\nmen who were expert riders and who knew how use a horse in a combat\nsituation. Even more, with the arrival the Europeans in the fifteenth\ncentury, West Africa was introduced to guns and gunpowder. These, too,\nwere expensive required  trained soldiers to make good use of them.\nWhile the new  military technology had increased the ruler's freedom from\npopular control, it made him increasingly dependent on and subject to\nEuropean interests. The African ruler's desire for guns and the\nEuropean's desire for slaves went hand in hand.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nThe Human Market\n\n\n\nThe Slave Trade\n\nNeither slavery nor the slave trade came to West Africa with the arrival\nof the Portuguese in the middle of the fifteenth century. To the\ncontrary, both institutions had a very long history. A two-way slave\ntrade had existed between the West Africans and the Arabs for centuries.\nIn view of the social structure of both societies, sociologists believe\nthat the Arabs could make use of more slaves than could the West\nAfricans.  Therefore, West Africa probably exported more slaves than it\nimported.\n\nSlaves, besides being common laborers, were often men of considerable\nskill and learning, Slavery was not a badge of human inferiority. Thus,\nthe first slaves procured by the Europeans from Africa were displayed as\ncuriosities and as proof of affluence. While, especially at the\nbeginning, some slaves were taken by force, most of the African slaves\nacquired by the Europeans were obtained in the course of a peaceful and\nregular bargaining process.\n\nWhen the Portuguese arrived in West Africa, they found a thriving economy\nwhich had already developed its own bustling trading centers.  Before\nlong, a vigorous trade opened up between the Portuguese and the West\nAfricans. Slaves were only one of a great variety of exports, and guns\nwere only one of a large variety of imports. One of the ways in which the\nslave trade came to cripple the West African economy was that slaves\nbecame almost the exclusive African export. The more the Africans sought\nto fulfill the Europeans' thirst for slaves, the more they needed guns\nwith which to procure slaves, and to protect themselves from being\ncaptured and sold into slavery. Therefore, the Euro-African trade,\ninstead of further stimulating the African economy, actually limited\nproduction of many items and drained it of much of its most productive\nmanpower.\n\nThe rulers, who had voluntarily and unwittingly involved themselves in\nthis gigantic trade, soon found themselves trapped.  Those who wanted to\neliminate or reduce the trade in slaves and who preferred to develop\nother aspects of a trading economy, found themselves helpless. A ruler\nwho would not provide the Europeans with the slaves they desired was then\nbypassed by all the European traders. Besides losing the revenue from\nthis trade, his own military position was weakened. Any ruler who did not\ntrade slaves for guns could not have guns. Without guns, he would have\ndifficulty in protecting himself and his people. Any ruler or people who\ncould not provide adequate self-defense could be captured and sold into\nslavery. Once begun, the Africans found themselves enmeshed in a vicious\nsystem from which there seemed to be no escape.  The only possibility for\nescape would have been the development of some kind of African coalition,\nbut each petty ruler as too concerned with his own power to be able to\ncontemplate federated activity. European greed fed African greed, and\nvice a versa.\n\nIn the beginning, African slaves were carried back to Portugal and other\nparts of Europe to be used as exotic domestic servants.  In some cases,\nthey were also used as farm laborers. Parts of Portugal were suffering\nfrom a distinct shortage of farm laborers, and Africans filled the void.\nAt the beginning of the sixteenth century, in some sections of rural\nPortugal as much as one third of local population was African in origin.\n\nEven so, European labor needs could not support much of a slave trade for\nlong. The enclosure system was under way, changing farming techniques,\nand it had created a labor surplus.  However, at the same time, emerging\ncapitalism financed explorations in Africa, Asia, and the western\nhemisphere. African sailors were involved in most of these explorations\nincluding Columbus's voyage in 1492. New World gold provided the economic\nbasis for even more rapid European expansion.  When the New World came to\nbe viewed by the hungry capitalists as having a potential for\nagricultural exploitation, New World labor needs expanded astronomically.\nAt first these needs were filled by surplus labor from Europe or by\nexploiting the local Indian populations. When these labor sources proved\nto be inadequate, the exploitation of slave labor from Africa was the\nobvious answer.\n\nWhile the Portuguese were the first to reach the shores of West Africa\nand the first to bring African slaves back to Europe, neither they nor\nthe Spaniards ever dominated the slave trade which followed. In 1493, as\nEuropean exploration of the world moved into high gear, the Pope\npublished a Bull dividing the world yet to be explored into two parts.\nHis intention was to limit competition and conflict between the rulers of\nSpain and Portugal and to prevent undue hostility between his two main\nsupporters.\n\nHowever, this left the other European powers, officially, with no room\nfor overseas expansion. While these powers refused to acknowledge the\nlegality of the Bull and soon became involved in exploration and\ncolonization in spite of it, they also tended to become more involved\nthan did Portugal or Spain in some of the by-products of colonization,\nsuch as the slave trade. When the Spaniards began to use slaves in their\nAmerican colonies, the Dutch, French, and British were only too eager to\nprovide the transportation. Before long, they too had colonies and slaves\nof their own.\n\nThe triangular trade between Europe, Africa, and the New World, was one\nof the most lucrative aspects of the mercantile economy. Mercantilism\nsought to keep each country economically self-sufficient. Within this\nframework the role of the colony was to provide the mother country with\nraw materials which it could not produce for itself and to be a market\nfor the consumption of many of the manufactured goods produced within the\nmother country.\n\nThis triangular trade began in Europe with the purchase of guns,\ngunpowder, cheap cotton, and trinkets of all kinds.  These were shipped\nto the coast of West Africa and unloaded at a trading station. At key\npoints along the coast, the European nations had made treaties with the\nlocal rulers allowing them to set up trading stations and slave\nfactories. At this point, the European traders entered into hard\nbargaining sessions with the representatives of the local ruler in which\nthe manufactured goods from Europe, especially guns, were traded for\nAfrican slaves. When the deal was completed, the slaves were loaded on\nthe ship, and the captain set sail for the New World.\n\nUpon arrival in the West Indies, another bargaining process was begun.\nHere the slaves were traded for local agricultural products which were\nwanted in Europe. Then the ships were loaded with tobacco, sugar, and\nother West Indian produce and returned to Europe for still another sale\nand another profit. At every point along the route, large sums of money\nwere made. A profit of at east one hundred percent was expected. Vast\nwealth was obtained through the slave trade, and this money was\nreinvested in the developing industrial revolution. Thereby the Africans\nunwittingly helped to finance the European industrial revolution which\nwidened the technological gap between Africa and Europe.\n\nThe African slave was sometimes a criminal, but, more often than not, he\nwas captured in battle. As the slave trade grew and with it the need for\nmore slaves, the number of these battles increased. Clearly, many battles\nwere being fought solely for the purpose of acquiring slaves who could\nthen be sold to the European traders. Sometimes, too, the slave might\nhave been the political enemy of the ruler or of some other powerful\nperson.\n\nThe slaves were then marched to trading stations along the coast where a\nEuropean agent, who resided at the station, inspected them and negotiated\ntheir purchase. The inspection was humiliating and degrading procedure.\nMen, women, and children usually appeared stark naked and underwent the\nclose scrutiny of the agent and sometimes a physician.  After the trauma\nof capture and the shame of inspection, the slaves were regimented into\ncrowded quarters at the trading station or \"factory\" to wait for the next\nshipment to leave. They had to be supervised very closely as many tried\nto escape and others tried to commit suicide.\n\nWhen a ship was ready to sail, the slaves were chained together and\nmarched down to the shore. There they were bundled into large canoes and\nwere paddled through the crashing breakers to where the slave ship was\nwaiting. Slaves have told how they began the voyage in trepidation, being\nfrightened by the sight of the \"white devils\" who, they had heard, liked\nto eat Africans. Then the long voyage commenced.  Conditions here were\neven more crowded than at the \"factory.\" Slaves were generally kept below\ndeck with no sunshine or fresh air. They were crowded so close  together\nthat there was never any standing room and often not even sitting room.\nAgain, they had to be supervised closely as many tried to starve\nthemselves to death or to jump overboard.  However, the greatest loss of\nslave property was due to disease, The ship's captain feared that disease\nwould whittle away his profits, and, even more, he worried that it would\nattack him and his crew. When the passage was completed, and the West\nIndies had been safely reached, the slave again had to undergo the same\nkind of degrading inspection and sale which had occurred in Africa, but\nthis time he had to experience the torment in a strange and distant land.\n\nWhile the economic profits in the slave trade were great, so were the\nhuman losses. Statistics concerning the slave trade are often inaccurate\nor missing. However, it is generally agreed that at least fifteen million\nAfricans, and perhaps many more, became slaves in the New World. About\nnine hundred thousand were brought in the sixteenth century, three\nmillion in the seventeenth century, seven million in the eighteenth\ncentury, and another four million in the nineteenth century.\n\nThe mortality rate among these new slaves ran very high. It is estimated\nthat some five percent died in Africa on the way to the coast, another\nthirteen percent in transit to the West Indies, and still another thirty\npercent during the three-month seasoning period in the West Indies.  This\nmeant that about fifty percent of those originally captured in Africa\ndied either in transit or while being prepared for servitude.\n\nEven this statistic, harsh as it is, does not tell the whole story of the\nhuman cost involved in the slave trade. Most slaves were captured in the\ncourse of warfare, and many more Africans were killed in the course of\nthis combat. The total number of deaths, then, ran much higher than those\nkilled en route. Many Africans became casualty statistics, directly or\nindirectly, because of the slave trade. Beyond this, there was the untold\nhuman sorrow and misery borne by the friends and relatives of those\nAfricans who were torn away from home and loved ones and were never seen\nagain.\n\nStatistics concerning profits in the slave trade are also difficult to\nobtain. Profits often ran as high as two or three hundred percent, and\nwere an important part of the European economy. These profits provided\nmuch of the capital which helped to spur on the industrial revolution.\nWhen Queen Elizabeth, in 1562, heard that one of her subjects, John\nHawkins, had become involved in the slave trade, she was very critical\nand commented that he would have to pay a very high price for dealing in\nhuman lives. However, when she was confronted with a copy of his profit\nledger, her moral indignation softened, and she quickly became one of the\nmembers of the corporation. Some merchants were hit hard by the risks\naccompanying the slave trade and suffered financial disaster.  The\npossible profits were so high, however, that other merchants were always\neager to venture into this field and new capital was ever lacking.\n\nThe industrial revolution, which was partly financed by the slave trade,\neventually abolished the need for slavery. The humanitarian outcry\nagainst both the slave trade and slavery which occurred at the end of the\neighteenth century and swelled in the early nineteenth century, became a\nsignificant force as the need for slave labor diminished. In the\nbeginning, as previously noted, the Europeans were not powerful enough to\nseize slaves at will or to invade the African kingdoms. But the\nindustrial revolution had immeasurably widened the power gap between\nEurope and Africa. By the time the slave trade ended, and European\nadventurers had found new ways to achieve gigantic capital gains, Europe\nhad achieved a power advantage sufficient to invade Africa at will.\n\nAs European interests in colonizing Africa increased, the European\npowers, at the middle of the nineteenth century, were also tearing one\nanother apart in the process of this competitive expansion, In order to\navoid further misfortune, the great powers of Europe met at the\nconference of Berlin in 1885.  Without troubling to consult with any\nAfricans, they drew lines on a map of Africa dividing it among\nthemselves. It took only a very few years for a map drawing to become a\nphysical reality.  When the Europeans had finished exploiting Africa\nthrough the slave trade and had greatly weakened its societies, they\ninvaded Africa in order to exploit its nonhuman material resources.\n\n\nCaribbean Interlude\n\nMost of the Africans, who were enslaved and brought to the New World,\ncame to the American colonies after a period of seasoning in the\nCaribbean islands. To the Europeans who had settled in America the\nColonies were their new home and they strove to develop a prosperous and\nsecure society in which to live and raise their families. They hesitated\nto bring their slaves directly from Africa as they believed that Africans\nwere brutal, barbaric savages who would present a real danger to the\nsafety and security of their new homes. Instead, they preferred to\npurchase slaves who had already been tested and broken.\n\nIn contrast to this, Europeans who had gone to the Caribbean islands did\nnot consider the New World as their new home. The island plantations were\nto be exploited to provide the wealth with with which their owners could\nreturn to Europe and live like gentlemen. Many of them did not bring\ntheir families to the islands, or, when they did, their stay was a\ntemporary one. Therefore, they were more willing than were the Americans\nto purchase slaves directly from Africa. Moreover, because their sole\ninterest in the islands was economic profit, they could make a double\nprofit by selling their seasoned slaves as well as selling their\nplantation produce. While the Africans' stay in the Caribbean, obviously,\nwas not part of their African heritage, it was part of the experience\nwhich they brought with them to the Colonies.  Many of the events which\noccurred in the Caribbean islands had important repercussions in the\nAmerican Colonies.\n\nA quarter of a century after Columbus had discovered the New World, the\nfirst African slaves were brought to the West Indies to supplement the\ninadequate labor supply. The Indians who lived on the islands were few in\nnumber and had had no experience in plantation agriculture. As the\nshortage of labor became severe, the plantation owners began to import\ncriminals and were willing to accept the poor and the drunks who had been\nseized from the streets of European ports.\n\nThere was also a continual stream of indentured servants, but this influx\nwas nowhere nearly large enough to fill the growing labor demands. The\nadvantage of African slaves over indentured servants was that they could\nbe purchased outright for life.  Moreover, the Africans had no contacts\nin the European capitals through which they could bring pressure to bear\nagainst the abuses of the plantation masters. In fact, African slaves\nreally had no rights which the master was obliged to respect. The supply\nof African labor seemed to be endless, and many masters found it cheaper\nto overwork a slave and to replace him when he died, rather than take\ncare of him while he lived. In short, the plantation experience was a\nbrutalizing one.\n\nIn the beginning, the major plantation crop had been tobacco, It could be\ngrown efficiently on small plantations of twenty or thirty acres.  The\ntobacco plant needed constant, careful attention throughout the season,\nand this meant that the number of raw, unskilled laborers that was needed\nwas relatively small.\n\nHowever, when the new colony of Virginia entered the tobacco field in the\nearly seventeenth century, it was able to produce larger quantities of\ntobacco at a lower price. The Caribbean islands were hit by a severe\neconomic depression. The Dutch came with a solution. They had previously\nconquered parts of northern Brazil from the Portuguese, and there they\nhad learned the techniques of plantation sugar production.  It could only\nbe carried on efficiently with plantations of two or three hundred acres,\nand it required large numbers of unskilled laborers both to plant and\nharvest the crop and to refine the sugar.  The Dutch, then, brought sugar\ncane to the West Indies. This gave them a new plantation crop, and it\nalso gave them a new outlet for the slave trade which, at that point in\nhistory, they had come to dominate.\n\nThe development of the sugar cane economy in the West Indies produced a\nbasic social revolution. The small tobacco farmers did not have the\ncapital to develop the large sugar plantations.  Some of them went into\nother occupations, but most of them returned to Europe. The new labor\nneeds were filled by a gigantic increase in the importation of African\nslaves. The ratio of whites to blacks within the islands changed markedly\nwithin a matter of one or two decades. The white population consisted of\na handful of exceedingly wealthy plantation owners and another handful of\nwhite plantation managers. Many of the slaves soon learned new skills\nassociated with sugar manufacturing, thus reducing the need for white\nlabor even further. The rising demand for slaves meant an expansion of\nthe slave trade, and, as West Indian slaves had a high mortality rate and\na low birthrate, this meant a continually thriving slave trade.\n\nAs the ratio between whites and blacks widened, the problem of\ncontrolling the slaves grew more serious. Brute force was the only\nanswer. The European governments had tried to solve the problem by\nrequiring the plantation owners to hire a specified number of white\nworkers. However, many owners found it cheaper to pay the fine than to\ncomply with this regulation.\n\nIn 1667, the British Parliament passed a series of black codes intended\nto control the slaves in the Caribbean colonies. Other colonial powers\nfollowed their example. The law stated that a slave could not be away\nfrom the plantation on a Sunday and that he was not permitted to carry\nany weapons. It also specified that, if he were to strike a Christian, he\ncould be whipped. If he did it a second time, he could be branded on the\nface.  However, if a master, in the process of punishing a slave,\naccidentally beat him to death, this master could not be fined or\nimprisoned.\n\nBecause the Europeans did not view the islands as their home, there was\nalways a shortage of white women. One of the results of this was the\ndevelopment of an ever-growing class of mulattoes. More and more of them\nwere granted their freedom. While these freedmen did not receive equal\ntreatment with the whites, they were careful to preserve the advantages\nthey held over the slaves. Many of them served in the militia to help\nkeep the slaves under control. However, the threat of slave revolts\ncontinued. The greater the possibility of success, the greater the\nprobability that slaves would take the risk of starting a revolt. All of\nthe islands in the West Indies had a history of slave rebellion.\n\nUndoubtedly, the most outstanding slave revolt in the western hemisphere\ntook place in Haiti. During the French revolution, concepts of the rights\nof man spread from France to her colonies.  In Haiti, the free mulattoes\npetitioned the French revolutionary government for their rights. The\nAssembly granted their request.  However, the French aristocrats in Haiti\nrefused to follow the directives of the Assembly.  At this point, two\nfree mulattoes, Vincent Oge and Jean Baptiste Chavannes, both of whom had\nreceived an education in Paris, led a mulatto rebellion. The Haitian\naristocrats quickly and brutally suppressed it.\n\nBy this time, however, the concepts of the rights of man had spread to\nthe slave class. In 1791, under the leadership of Toussaint l'Ouverture,\nthe slaves began a long and bloody revolt of their own.  Slaves flocked\nto Toussaint's support by the thousands until he had an army much larger\nthan any that had fought in the American revolution, This revolt became\nentangled with the French revolution and the European wars connected with\nit. Besides fighting the French, Toussaint had to face both British and\nSpanish armies. None of them was able to suppress the revolt and to\noverthrow the republic which had been established in Haiti.\n\nAfter Napoleon came to power in France, he sent a gigantic expedition\nunder Leclerc to reestablish French authority in Haiti.  While he claimed\nto stand for the principles of the revolution, Napoleon's real interest\nin Haiti was to make it into a base from which to rebuild a French empire\nin the western hemisphere.  Toussaint lured this French army into the\nwilderness where the soldiers, who had no immunity to tropical diseases,\nwere hit very hard by malaria and yellow fever.\n\nToussaint was captured by trickery, but his compatriots carried on the\nfight for independence. Finally, Napoleon was forced to withdraw from the\nstruggle. One of the results of his failure to suppress the slave revolt\nin Haiti was his abandonment of his New World dreams and his willingness\nto sell Louisiana to the United States. Unfortunately, this meant new\nareas for the expansion of the plantation economy and slavery. In other\nwords, the Haitian revolution was responsible for giving new life to the\ninstitution of slavery inside America.\n\nAmerican plantation owners were faced with a dilemma. The Louisiana\nPurchase, resulting from the revolution in Haiti, greatly expanded the\npossibilities of plantation agriculture.  This meant a greater need for\nslave labor. However, they were not sure from which source to purchase\nthese slaves. They hesitated to bring new slaves directly from Africa.\nThey were also loath to bring seasoned slaves from the Caribbean.  Events\nin Haiti had demonstrated that these Caribbean slaves might not be as\ndocile as previously had been believed. Certainly, Americans did not want\nrepetition of the bloody Haitian revolt within their own borders. Greedy\nmen still bought slaves where they could, but many American slave owners\nwere deeply disturbed and began to give serious thought to terminating\nthe importation of African slaves to America.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nSlavery as Capitalism\n\n\nThe Shape of American Slavery\n\nThe slave system in America was unique in human history.  Sometimes\nslaves were treated cruelly; at other times with kindness. They were more\noften used as a sign of affluence, a way of displaying one's wealth and\nof enjoying luxury, rather than as the means for the systematic\naccumulation of wealth. Previously, slavery had existed in hierarchical\nsocieties in which the slave was at the bottom of a social ladder, the\nmost inferior in a society of unequals. While each society normally\npreferred to choose its slaves from alien people, it did not limit its\nselection exclusively to the members of any one race. Slave inferiority\ndid not lead necessarily to racial inferiority. In contrast to this,\nslavery in America was set apart by three characteristics: capitalism,\nindividualism, and racism.\n\nCapitalism increased the degree of dehumanization and depersonalization\nimplicit in the institution of slavery. While it had been normal in other\nforms of slavery for the slave to be legally defined as a thing, a piece\nof property, in America he also became a form of capital. Here his life\nwas regimented to fill the needs of a highly organized productive system\nsensitively attuned to the driving forces of competitive free enterprise.\nAmerican masters were probably no more cruel and no more sadistic than\nothers, and, in fact, the spread of humanitarianism in the modern world\nmay have made the opposite true.  Nevertheless, their capitalistic\nmentality firmly fixed their eyes on minimizing expenses and maximizing\nprofits. Besides being a piece of property, the American slave was\ntransformed into part of the plantation machine, a part of the\never-growing investment in the master' mushrooming wealth.\n\nThe development of slavery in America resulted from the working of\neconomic forces and not from climatic or geographic conditions.  When the\nfirst twenty Africans reached Virginia in 1619, the colony was comprised\nof small plantations dependent on free white labor. While some historians\nbelieve that these immigrants were held in slavery from the beginning,\nmost think they were given the status of indentured servants.  English\nlaw contained no such category as slavery, and the institution did not\nreceive legal justification in the colony until early in the 1660s.\nAlthough the fact of slavery had undoubtedly preceded its legal\ndefinition, there was a period of forty years within which the Africans\nhad some room for personal freedom and individual opportunity. Rumors of\ndeplorable working conditions and of indefinite servitude were reaching\nEngland and discouraging the flow of free white labor. To counter this, a\nseries of acts were passed which legally established the rights of white\nlabor, but they did nothing to improve the status of the African. In\nfact, their passage pushed them relentlessly towards the status of slave.\n\nThe price of tobacco declined sharply in the 1660s and drove the small\nwhite farmer to the wall. Only those with enough capital to engage in\nlarge-scale operations could continue to make a profit.  In order to fill\nthe need for the huge labor supply required large-scale agriculture, the\ncolonial legislature passed laws giving legal justification to slavery.\nAt the same time, Charles II granted a royal charter establishing a\ncompany to transport African slaves across the ocean and thereby\nincreasing the supply of slaves available to the colonial planter.\n\nUntil this time, the number of Africans in the colony had been very\nsmall, but thereafter their numbers grew rapidly. The African slaves\nprovided the large, dependable, and permanent supply of labor which these\nplantations required.  The small white planter and the free white laborer\nfound the road to economic success had become much more difficult. To be\na successful planter meant that he had to begin with substantial capital\ninvestments. Capitalist agriculture substantially altered the social\nstructure of the colony. On one hand, it created a small class of rich\nand powerful white planters. On the other, it victimized the small white\nplanters, or white laborers, and the ever-growing mass of African slaves.\n\nThe second unique factor in American slavery was the growth of\nindividualism. While this democratic spirit attracted many European\nimmigrants, it only served to increase the burden of slavery for the\nAfrican. Instead of being at the bottom of the social ladder, the slave\nin America was an inferior among equals.  A society which represented\nitself as recognizing individual worth and providing room for the\ndevelopment of talent, rigidly organized the entire life of the slave and\ngave him little opportunity to develop his skills. In America, a person's\nworth became identified with economic achievement. To be a success in\nVirginia was to be a prosperous planter, and white individualism could\neasily become white oppression leaving no room for black individualism.\nThe existence of slavery in a society which maintained its belief in\nequality was a contradiction which men strove diligently to ignore.\n\nPerhaps this contradiction can be partly understood by seeing the way in\nwhich individual rights had come into being in English society.  Instead\nof springing from a belief in abstract human rights, they were an\naccumulation of concrete legal and political privileges which had\ndeveloped since Magna Charta.  Viewing it in this light, it may have been\neasier for the white colonists to insist on their rights while denying\nthem to the slaves. Nevertheless, the existence of slavery in the midst\nof a society believing in individualism increased its dehumanizing\neffects.\n\nThe third characteristic which set American slavery apart was its racial\nbasis. In America, with only a few early and insignificant exceptions,\nall slaves were Africans, and almost all Africans were slaves. This\nplaced the label of inferiority on black skin and on African culture. In\nother societies, it had been possible for a slave who obtained his\nfreedom to take his place in his society with relative ease. In America,\nhowever, when a slave became free, he was still obviously an African. The\ntaint of inferiority clung to him.\n\nNot only did white America become convinced of white superiority and\nblack inferiority, but it strove to impose these racial beliefs on the\nAfricans themselves. Slave masters gave a great deal of attention to the\neducation and training of the ideal slave, In general, there were five\nsteps in molding the character of such a slave: strict discipline, a\nsense of his own inferiority, belief in the master's superior power,\nacceptance of the master's standards, and, finally, a deep sense of his\nown helplessness and dependence. At every point this education was built\non the belief in white superiority and black inferiority.  Besides\nteaching the slave to despise his own history and culture, the master\nstrove to inculcate his own value system into the African's outlook. The\nwhite man's belief in the African's inferiority paralleled African self\nhate.\n\nSlavery has always been an evil institution, and being a slave has always\nbeen undesirable. However, the slave in America was systematically\nexploited for the accumulation of wealth. Being a slave in a democracy,\nhe was put outside of the bounds of society.  Finally, because his\nslavery was racially defined, his plight was incurable.  Although he\nmight flee from slavery, he could not escape his race.\n\n\nNorth American and South American Slavery\n\nSlavery, as it existed in British North America, contained interesting\npoints of comparison and contrast with the slave system existing in\nPortuguese and Spanish South America. Although both institutions were\ngeared to the needs of capitalistic agriculture, the rights and\nprivileges of the South American planter were restricted and challenged\nat many points by the traditional powers the Crown and the Church. On one\nhand, capitalism, unimpeded by other powerful institutions, created a\nclosed slave system which regimented the totality of the slave's life. On\nthe other hand, through the clash of competing institutions, the slave as\nbeen left with a little opportunity in which he could develop as a person.\n\nIn the seventeenth century, while the British colonies were being\nestablished in North America and their slave system was being created,\nthe English Crown underwent a series of severe shocks including two\nrevolutions. Although it eventually emerged secure, the monarchy managed\nto survive only by making its peace with the emerging commercial and\nindustrial forces. These same crises undermined the authority of the\nChurch as a powerful institution in society. The nonconformist sects were\nthe stronghold of the merchant class and spread rapidly in the American\ncolonies.  There, instead of being a check on the commercial spirit, the\nChurch itself had become dominated by the middle class. Equally important\nis the fact that in colonial America the level of religious life was very\nlow. Most colonists, with the exception of the original founders who had\nfled religious persecution, did not come for religious freedom but for\neconomic advancement. When some Virginians at the end of the seventeenth\ncentury, petitioned the government to build a college for the training of\nministers, they were told to forget about the cure of souls and instead\nto cure tobacco.  The result was that the planter class, unchallenged by\nany other powerful institutions, was free to shape a slave system to meet\nits labor needs. In any conflict which arose between personality rights\nand property rights the property rights of the master were always\nprotected.\n\nIn contrast, the South American planter would not have such a free hand\nin shaping his own affairs. The Renaissance and Reformation had not made\nthe same impact on Spain and Portugal as they did on the rest of Western\nEurope. Consequently, secularization and commercialization had not\nprogressed as far in eroding the traditional power and prestige of the\nCrown and the Church. Although both institutions readily compromised with\ncapitalist interests and strove to develop a working alliance with them,\nneither the Crown nor the Church in Spain and Portugal had ever been\ntaken over by the commercial interests.\n\nBoth Spain and Portugal had had continuous contact with slavery extending\nback into ancient times. Roman law as well as the Church fathers had\nconcerned themselves with it, and these concepts had been incorporated\ninto Spanish and Portuguese law. Also, slaves continued to exist in both\ncountries down to modern times. Therefore, when Portugal began importing\nslaves from West Africa in the fifteenth century, the institution of\nslavery was already in existence. Before long, significant numbers of\nAfrican slaves were to be found in both Portugal and Spain. When the\nSouth American planters began importing slaves, slavery already had a\nframework and a tradition within which the planter had to operate.\n\nThe Spanish Crown devoted a great deal of time and energy to the\nsupervision of its overseas possessions. Instead of permitting\nconsiderable local autonomy as the British did, the Spanish Council of\nthe Indies in Madrid assumed a stance of illiberal, paternal,\nbureaucratic control. From the point of view of the colonial capitalists,\nthe cumbersome royal bureaucracy was always involved in troublesome\nmeddling which impeded their progress. As part of the careful management\nof its colonies, the Crown strove to control the operation of the slave\ntrade.  Similarly, it was concerned with the treatment of the African\nslaves within the colonies. The Spanish Crown included the slaves as\npersons instead of relegating them solely to the status of property at\nthe disposal of their owners.\n\nThe Church, as a powerful institution, jealously guarded its right to be\nthe guardian and protector of social morality.  Besides being concerned\nwith influencing individual behavior, the Church insisted that it was a\nsocial institution with the right to interfere in matters relating to\npublic morals. In fact, it was through this role that the Church was able\nto exercise its worldly powers.  While condemning slavery as an evil and\nwarning that it endangered those who participated in it, the Church found\nit expedient to accept slavery as a labor system. However, it insisted\nthat the African slaves must be Christianized. Missionaries were sent to\nthe trading stations on the African coast where the captives were\nbaptized and catechized. The Church feared that the purity of the faith\nmight be undermined by the infusion of pagan influences.  Then, when a\nslave ship reached the New World, a friar boarded the ship and examined\nthe slaves to see that the requirements had been met. The Church also\ninsisted that the slaves become regular communicants, and it liked to\nview itself as the champion of their human rights.\n\nThe degree to which the individual rights of the slave were either\nprotected or totally suppressed provides a clearer insight to the\ndifferences between North American and South American slavery.  The laws\noutlining the rights of slaves have been traditionally placed into four\ncategories: term of servitude, marriage and the family, police and\ndisciplinary powers, and, finally, property and other civil rights.\n\nIn both systems the term of servitude was for life, and the child's\nstatus was inherited from its mother. Children of slave mothers were\nslaves, and children of free mothers were free regardless of the status\nof the father. Inherited lifetime slavery was the norm.\n\nManumission--granting freedom--was infrequent in British North America.\nOccasionally, masters who had fathered slave children would later give\nthem their freedom. A few other slaves were able to purchase their own\nfreedom although, strictly speaking, this was a legal impossibility.  The\nslave was not able to own property according to the law, and this meant\nthat the money with which he purchased his freedom had always belonged to\nhis master.  Obviously, he could only do this with his master's fullest\ncooperation.\n\nIn South America, however, manumission was much more frequent.  This\npractice received highly favorable social sanction, and masters often\ncelebrated national holidays, anniversaries, birthdays, and other special\nevents by manumitting one or more of their favorite slaves.\n\nThe law also defended the right of the slave to purchase his own freedom.\nHe had the right to own property and could accumulate funds with which he\nmight eventually achieve his dream.  He also had the right to demand that\nhis master or the courts set a fixed price for his purchase which he\ncould then pay over a period of years. Sundays and holidays were for the\nslave to use as he saw fit, and, in some cases, he was also guaranteed a\ncouple of hours every day for his own use.  During this time he could\nsell his services and save the proceeds. The law also stated that parents\nof ten or more children were to be set free.  Finally, slaves could be\nfreed by the courts as the result of mistreatment by their masters.\n\nWhile there was much sentiment in North America supporting marriages\namong slaves, and there was much animosity against masters who separated\nfamilies through sale, the law was unambiguous on this point.  Slaves\nwere property, and therefore could not enter into contracts including\ncontracts of marriage.  Jurists also noted that to prevent the sale of\nseparate members of a family would lower the sale price, and this was to\ntamper with a man's property. Therefore, property rights had to be placed\nabove marriage rights. In contrast, in South America the Church insisted\nthat slave unions be brought within the sacrament of marriage. The Church\nalso strove to limit promiscuous relationships between slaves as well as\nbetween masters and slaves, and it encouraged marriage instead of\ninformal mating.  Also, the law forbade the separate sale of members of\nthe family, husband, wife, and children under the age of ten.\n\nThe general thrust of the laws outlining police and disciplinary powers\nin North America was to entrust complete jurisdiction to the master.  One\njudge had laid down the law that the master's power must be absolute in\norder to render slave obedience perfect, and, although the courts were\nempowered to discipline slaves in certain situations, the masters\ngenerally acted as judges, juries, and dispensers of punishments. In\nthose rare cases where the law did protect the slave against extreme\nmistreatment, its protection was nullified by the universal proscription\nagainst any slave or Black person testifying in court against any white.\nThe court also had assumed that it was irrational for a man to destroy\nhis own property, and, therefore, it was impossible for a master to\ncommit premeditated murder against one of his own slaves.\n\nHowever, in South America the court exercised much more Jurisdiction over\nthe slave. Crimes comitted by a slave were prosecuted by the court, and,\nif a slave was murdered, this case was prosecuted by the court as if the\nvictim had been a free man.  The law also made a more concerted attempt\nto protect the slave against mistreatment by his master. A certain type\nof state lawyer was an official protector of the slaves; he received\nregular reports on slave conditions from priests as well as from special\ninvestigative officials who had been appointed by the state for this\npurpose.  Mistreatment could lead both to the freedom of the slave and to\nthe imprisoning of the master. The law had devised an ingenious system\nwhereby the fine was divided equally between the judge, the informer, and\nthe state treasury.\n\nFinally, the slave in North America could not own property and had\nabsolutely no civil rights. The law clearly stated that he could neither\nown, inherit, or will property nor engage in buying and selling except at\nthe pleasure of his master. In contrast, the slave in South America could\nown property, could engage in buying and selling, and was guaranteed\nSundays, holidays, and other times which to work for his own advancement.\nIn short, the law implied that while the master could own a man's labor,\nhe could not own the man as a person.\n\nIt is not easy to make a final comparison between these two slave\nsystems. South American masters often evaded the law and would be\nexceedingly brutal, and North American masters were often much more\nlenient than the law required. Conditions moreover, were usually more\nsevere in South America, and this fact may have worsened the actual\nmaterial situation of South American slave.  Nevertheless, in North\nAmerica the slave was consistently treated as a \"thing.\" In South America\nthere was some attempt to treat him as a man. This fact made a profound\ndifference in the way in which the two systems affected the slave as an\nindividual, and in the way in which they impinged upon the development of\nhis personality.\n\n\nSlavery and the Formation of Character\n\nThe study of American slavery, frequently consisting of a heated debate\nconcerning the institution's merits, has, in recent years, branched into\nnew directions. Scholars have become engaged in the comparative\nexamination of differing slave systems such as those of North and South\nAmerica. More recently, Stanley M. Elkins has begun an inquiry into the\nimpact of a slave system in forming the individual character of the\nslaves within that system. In his provocative study, Slavery: A Problem\nin American Institutional and Intellectual Life, he has made some\ninteresting comparisons between the American slave system and the German\nconcentration camps and has endeavored to account for their respective\nimpacts on character formation through the social-psychological theories\nof personality formation.\n\nIn Elkins's thinking, the concentration camps were a modern example of a\nrigid system controlling mass behavior. Because some of those who\nexperienced them were social scientists trained in the skills of\nobservation and analysis, they provide a basis for insights into the way\nin which a particular social system can influence mass character.  While\nthere is also much literature about American slavery written both by\nslaves and masters, none of it was written from the viewpoint of modern\nsocial sciences.  However, Elkins postulates that a slave type must have\nexisted as the result of the attempt to control mass behavior, and he\nbelieves that this type probably bore a marked resemblance to the\nliterary stereotype of \"Sambo.\" Studying concentration camps and their\nimpact on personality provides a tool for new insights into the working\nof slavery, but, warns Elkins, the comparison can only be used for\nlimited purposes. Although slavery was not unlike the concentration camp\nin many respects, the concentration camp can be viewed as a highly\nperverted form of slavery, and both systems were ways of controlling mass\nbehavior.\n\nThe \"Sambo\" of American slave literature was portrayed as being docile\nbut irresponsible, loyal but lazy, humble but chronically given to lying\nand stealing. He was a child figure, often demonstrating infantile\nsilliness and exaggeration, exasperating but lovable and, above all,\nutterly dependent on and attached to his master. The master explained\nthis behavior as the result of the slave's race or of his primitive\nAfrican culture.\n\nWhile assuming that many slaves did approximate the character of \"Sambo,\"\nElkins absolutely rejects any racial or cultural explanation.  Modern\nAfrican studies have not led to any evidence of a \"Sambo\" type in Africa.\nSimilarly, the literature of South America does not contain any figure\ncomparable to him.  Apparently, \"Sambo\" was not merely the result of\nslavery, but he was the result of the unique form of slavery which\ndeveloped in North America. Unrestricted in his powers by institutions\nsuch as the crown and the Church, the American slave master had gained\ntotal control of his slave property. In a desire to maximize the profits\nof his investment, he strove to develop the perfect slave. Although the\nslave might endeavor to conform externally while maintaining his inner\nintegrity, eventually his performance as an ideal slave must have\naffected the shape of his personality. Modern existentialism has argued\nthat how we behave determines what we are, and it is in this sense that\nthe controlled behavior in the concentration camp and its impact on\npersonality formation provide an illuminating parallel to the study of\nAmerican slavery.\n\nThe experienced gained in the German concentration camps during the\nSecond World War showed that it was possible to induce widespread\ninfantile behavior in masses of adults. Childlike action extended\nbeyond obedience to the guards and showed that a basic character\ntransformation had occurred. Previous social-psychological theory\nstressed the ways in which an individual's personality was shaped\nduring his earliest childhood years and emphasized the tenacity with\nwhich these early traits resisted attempt at alteration.  Personality\ntheory was not  adequate to what occurred in the camps.\n\nThe concentration camp experience began with what has become labeled as\nshock procurement. As terror was one of the many tools of the system,\nsurprise late-night arrests were the favorite technique. Camp inmates\ngenerally agreed that the train ride to the camp was the point at which\nthey experienced the first brutal torture. Herded together into cattle\ncars, without adequate space, ventilation, or sanitary conditions, they\nhad to endure the horrible crowding and the harassment of the guards.\nWhen they reached the camp, they had to stand naked in line and undergo a\ndetailed examination by the camp physician. Then, each was given a tag\nand a number. These two events were calculated to strip away one's\nidentity and to reduce the individual to an item within an impersonal\nsystem.\n\nOne's sense of personhood was further undermined by the fact that there\nwas never any privacy. The individual had lost both his identity and his\npower.  Everything was done to him or for him, but nothing was ever done\nby him. The guards had the power to dispense food, clothing, shelter,\npunishment, and even death Prisoners had to request permission to use the\nsanitary facilities, and permission was not always forthcoming. As the\ninmates were not sentenced for specified periods of time, they tended to\nview camp life as having a limitless future.\n\nIn a relatively short time, this experience of total dependence developed\ncharacteristics of infantile behavior in those prisoners who managed to\navoid the extermination chambers. A childish humor and infantile giggling\nwere common. Boasting and lying were widely practiced. Patterns of hero\nworship emerged, and the guards became the heroes. The prisoners came to\naccept their values including their German nationalism and anti-Semitism.\nSome even altered their uniforms to resemble those of the guards, and\nthey slavishly followed orders beyond necessity. Attempts at resistance\nwere very rare, and, when the liberating American forces arrived at the\nend of the war, they were surprised that there was not some attempt at\nmass revenge.\n\nIn comparison, the African who became an American slave underwent an\nexperience which had some marked similarities to those of the German\nconcentration camp. He too underwent a kind of shock procurement.\nAlthough millions of men became slaves, the event was unique to each man.\nUsually, he had been captured in the course of warfare which, in itself,\nwas a humiliation. After being chained together and marched to the coast,\nhis horror must have increased when he realized that he was being sold to\nEuropeans. It was widely believed by Africans that white men were\ncannibals. At the coastal station, he also had to endure the humiliation\nof a naked inspection by a physician. This was followed by a lengthy\ntransoceanic trip which must have exceeded the horrors of the train ride\nto the concentration camp. The crowded unsanitary conditions in the slave\nships were at least as bad as those in the cattle cars, and the Africans\nalso were beaten and harassed to keep them docile.\n\nMoreover, the trip itself was much rougher and longer. After undergoing\nanother inspection, the African was purchased and had to face lifetime of\nbondage in an alien environment. He was stripped of identity, given a new\nname, and he was taught to envision himself and his African heritage as\ninferior and barbaric. The White master insisted on total obedience and\ncreated a situation of utter dependence. He supplied food, clothing,\nshelter, discipline, and he was in a position to control the slave's\nfriends and mating.  The \"Sambo\" of literature mirrored reality, this\nlife of dependency created infantile characteristics in many of the\nslaves and taught them to reject their past while adopting the values of\ntheir masters. The American slave system, besides exploiting the Africans\nlabor, possessed and violated his person.\n\nThree schools of mass behavior have been suggested as explanations:\nFreudian psychology, the interpersonal theories of Henry Stack Sullivan,\nand role psychology. Freudian psychology has put total emphases on early\nchildhood experiences and is the least suited for this purpose. It could\nbe argued that the shock procurement and the total detachment from\nprevious life which it achieved both in the concentration camps and in\nAmerican slavery emptied the super-ego or conscience of its contents.\nThen, the creation of total dependence which followed could have resulted\nin infantile regression. This would account for the childlike behavior of\nboth \"Sambo\" and the camp inmates. The slave master the camp guard, each\nin his own way, became a father figure, and the respective victims\ninternalized the value system of this symbolic father.\n\nThe interpersonal school of psychology states that the determining factor\nin influencing personality development can be found in the estimation and\nexpectation of \"significant others.\" Those responsible for the physical\nand emotional security of an individual are his \"significant others.\" For\na child these are his parents. As he matures, the number of \"significant\nothers\" in one's experience increases. This permits one to make decisions\nof one's own and to develop some individuality.\n\nHowever, the child has already internalized the estimations and\nexpectations of his parents, and this tends to shape his personality for\nrest of his life. Still, acquiring new \"significant others\" as adult can\nbe important in reshaping the adult personality. Both the American slaves\nand the camp prisoners were thrust into situations in which they had a\nnew single \"significant other.\" This was a situation similar to that of\nchildhood, and it could have had the same impact in shaping personality.\nAll previous \"significant others\" had been made insignificant, and, in\neach case, the estimations and expectations of this new \"significant\nother\" became internalized into the personality of the victims.\n\nRole psychology holds the most promise for explaining the impact of a\nsocial situation in determining the development of individual\npersonality. In role psychology the individual and society can be\ncompared to the actor and the theater. Society provides the individual\nwith a number of roles, and the individual's behavior is his performance,\nthe way in which he plays them.\n\nNormally, each individual plays a number of roles simultaneously.  While\nsome are pervasive and extensive in scope, others are limited and\ntransitory, The role of man or woman is extensive, but that of customer\nor student is transitory. Society also endows some roles with\nconsiderable clarity, while leaving others open to individual\ninterpretation, The roles people play and the way in which they play them\ndetermine personality. Within American slavery as well as within the\nGerman concentration camps, the number of roles available were severely\nlimited, and both the slave master and the camp guard defined them very\nclearly. Both demanded a precise and careful performance.  There were\nthose whose performance was faultless in playing their roles. While the\nconcentration camp guard guaranteed its performance through terror and\ntorture, the slave master usually used more subtle means. Besides\npunishment for missed cues, masters displayed considerable fondness for\nslaves who played their part well. By restricting role availability and\nby carefully defining the performance, society could create a group\npersonality type, and, through changing roles, society could change\npersonality.\n\nAlthough the innovative use of personality types has further illuminated\nthe nature of the American slave system, it has tended to blur the\nindividual experiences and contributions of millions of Africans into a\nvague amorphous abstraction. The technique has provided important\ninsights into the plight of the slave as the victim of a dehumanizing\nsystem, but it tends to obscure the active participation of Africans in\nAmerican life.  Further, it is a crude generalization which, in fact,\nincluded many types within it. While most slaves were plantation field\nhands, there were many  whose lives followed different lines and for whom\nslavery was a very different experience. Some slaves departed sharply\nenough from the \"Sambo\" image to become leaders in insurrections. These\nmen were usually urban slaves possessing unusual talents, and thereby\nescaping much of the emasculation which the typical slave had to endure.\n\nEmphasizing the slave as the victim of the slave system further reduces\nhim to a passive object by insisting that the slave was effectively\ndetached from his African heritage. Many scholars, including Elkins,\nbelieve that the attempt to discover Africanisms in America by\nresearchers such as Melville J.  Herskovits has led to trivial and\ninsignificant results. This belief is reinforced by the example of the\nGerman concentration camps. There, people from wide variety of social and\neducational backgrounds reacted in highly similar ways. Apparently the\nindividual had been detached from his prior life, and his reactions to\nthe camp were shaped in standardized manner.  Similarly, it is argued,\nthe slave was stripped of his heritage, so that none of his African\nbackground could influence his life in America. His personality and\nbehavior were shaped exclusively by the unique form of American slavery.\n\nHowever, if we apply the experiences gained in the Chinese\nprisoner-of-war camps during the Korean War, some doubts on this point\ncan be raised. While Americans from a wide variety of social and\neducational backgrounds behaved with a marked similarity to each other,\nthereby appearing to prove that their previous experiences were\nirrelevant to their reactions to the camp, there was, to the contrary, a\nsignificant difference between the behavior the American and Turkish\nprisoners who had both been fighting the Korean War. The morale of the\nAmerican prisoners was easily broken, and each one strove to look out for\nhimself even at expense of his comrade's life. In contrast, the Turks\nmaintained military discipline and group solidarity. This evidence would\nseem indicate that, while individual differences were insignificant,\ncultural differences did influence adjustment to the camp situation.\n\nThere are also grounds to believe that different value systems influenced\nthe way in which contrasting cultures adjusted to slavery.  While the\nAfrican made the adjustment successfully, the American Indian, when he\nwas enslaved, did not.  The African's agricultural labor had contained\nmany similarities to the work required on the plantation, but the Indian,\naccustomed to a migratory hunting existence, was totally unprepared for\nplantation slavery.  He found nothing in it to sustain his values or his\nwill to live, and he was unable to make the adjustment.\n\nIf the African's agricultural background helped his adaptation to\nAmerican slavery, then we must assume that his detachment from his\nheritage was not complete. Perhaps, besides influencing his life as a\nslave, his African background may have found its way into other aspects\nof American society. However, it would seem that because the African came\nto believe in his own inferiority, there must have been very little\nconscious attempt to keep his culture alive. Certainly, the recent Black\nPower movement, which intended to revive pride in race and in the past,\nbears eloquent testimony to the degree to which any conscious link with\nthe African past had been suppressed. Nevertheless, mental and emotional\nhabit can continue without any conscious intention, and habits of this\nkind are important for the formation of personality, Moreover, it is\npossible that the image of \"Sambo\" as an exasperating child may tell as\nmuch about the mentality of the white master who perpetuated the picture\nas it does about the slave whom it depicted. Perhaps the picture of the\nchildlike slave is also a reverse image of the sober, patronizing white\nmaster whose life was rooted in austerity. To such a man spontaneity and\nexuberance might well have seemed infantile.\n\nThe life of a slave did not give him much opportunity to create artifacts\nwhich could later be catalogued as evidence of African influence.\nHowever, he did create a unique music. While Negro spirituals were not\nimported directly from Africa, they were more than an attempt to copy the\nmaster's music. They represent highly complex fusion of African and\nEuropean music, of African and European religion, and of African and\nEuropean emotion.  Blues and jazz, which emerged at a later date,\nrepresent a similar creative tension. They clearly evolve from the\nexperience of the African in America and include in them elements which\ncan be traced directly to Africa. Jazz is now viewed throughout the world\nas American music. It demonstrates the fact that the African immigrant\nwas not totally detached from his heritage and that he has made\nsignificant contributions to American culture.  While American slavery\ndid violate the person of the slave, some Africans, in the face of it\nall, managed to maintain some sense of individuality and manhood.\n\n\nSlave Response\n\nUndoubtedly, the slave's most common response to his condition was one of\nsubmission. There was no hope of his returning to Africa, and there was\nno realistic expectation that the situation would be significantly\naltered. The hopelessness of his plight created a deep sense of apathy.\nHowever, even this acceptance of his master's values may have reflected\nAfrican influences. It was common for a defeated tribe in West Africa to\nadopt the gods of its victors within the framework of its own religion.\nThis attitude would have facilitated the African's adjustment to slavery\nin an alien culture.\n\nThe majority of slaves worked in the fields on large plantations.  The\nmajority of them were herded into large work gangs, supervised by\noverseers, and carefully directed in the accomplishment of whatever task\nwas necessary for that day.  Others were regularly assigned to a specific\ntask without constant supervision and were held responsible for its\ncompletion. In this way it was possible for them to develop some sense of\ninitiative. House slave were usually better off than field hands, but,\nbecause they lived in such proximity to their masters, they were much\nquicker to adopt the master's values and tended to be more obsequious.\n\nAnother significant group of slaves, both on the plantation and in the\ncity, developed their talents and became skilled craftsmen: barbers,\nblacksmiths, carpenters, and a wide variety of other trades. Masters who\ncould not fully utilize the skills of such a craftsman rented their\nproperty to their neighbors. In some cases, master permitted the slave to\nbe responsible for hiring himself out and allowed him to keep some of the\nprofits.  The variety of experiences permitted within slavery allowed\nsignificant variations in the types of slaves who emerged.\n\nEven apparently submissive slaves developed techniques of passive\nresistance. The laziness, stealing, lying, and faked illnesses, which\nwere usually attributed to the slave's childlike behavior, may have been\ndeliberate ways of opposing the system. Masters complained that many of\ntheir slaves were chronic shirkers. When slaves dragged their feet while\nworking, it was seen as evidence of their inferiority. When white union\nworkers behave similarly, it is labeled a slowdown.\n\nOther slaves appear to have indulged in deliberate mischief, trampling\ndown crops, breaking tools, and abusing livestock.  A southern physician,\nDr. Cartwright, concluded that this behavior was symptomatic of a mental\ndisease peculiar to Africans. He labeled the disease Dysaethesia\nAethiopica and insisted that masters were wrong in thinking that it was\nmerely rascality.  He also concluded that the slave's chronic tendency to\nrun away was in reality the symptom of yet another African disease,\nDrapetomania, which he believed would eventually be medically cured.\n\nFinally, some slaves engaged in active resistance. Most of the slave\ninsurrections in America were very small, and most were unsuccessful.\nThe three best known insurrections were those led by Gabriel Prosser,\nDenmark Vesey, and Nat Turner. These revolts will be treated more fully\nin the next chapter.\n\nThe masters consistently refused to see examples of passive or active\nresistance as signs of manhood. Lying and stealing were never interpreted\nas passive resistance, but were always attributed to an inferior savage\nheritage, as was slave violence.  Prosser, Vesey, and Turner, instead of\nbeing numbered among the world's heroes fighting for the freedom of their\npeople, were usually represented as something closer to savages,\ncriminals, or psychopaths. Modern historical scholarship has been\ninfluenced by the interpretation of slave behavior, which stressed the\nimpact of the system on the slave, rather than his response to it.\nConsequently, it has failed to give proper recognition to African\ncontributions to American life.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nAll Men Are Created Equal\n\n\nSlavery and the American Revolution\n\n\"How is it,\" asked Samuel Johnson, \"that we hear the loudest yelps for\nliberty among the drivers of negroes?\"  The British author was only one\nof many Europeans who thought it strange that a nation run by slave\nowners should be so noisily demanding its own freedom.  This same bitter\ninconsistency was embodied in the death of Crispus Attucks.  A mulatto\nslave who had run away from his Massachusetts master in 1750, he spent\nthe next twenty years working as a seaman and living in constant fear of\ncapture and punishment.  In 1770, he, with four others, was killed in the\nBoston Massacre.  Ironically, the first man to die in the Colonial fight\nfor freedom was both an Afro-American and a runaway slave. His death\nbecame symbolic of what was to be an underlying question in the years to\ncome: \"What place would there be for the African in America once the\ncolonies gained freedom from the old world?\"\n\nThe Quakers were the first group in America to attack slavery.  In his\nbook Some Considerations on the Keeping of Negroes, John Woolman\ncontended that no one had the right to own another human being.  In 1758\nthe Philadelphia yearly meeting said that slavery was inconsistent with\nChristianity, and in 1775 Quakers played a dominant role in the formation\nof the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery, the first\nantislavery society in America.\n\nAs the colonists began to agitate for their own freedom, many of them\nbecame increasingly aware of the contradiction involved in slaveholders\nfighting for their own freedom.  \"To contend for liberty,\" John Jay\nwrote, \"and to deny that blessing to others involves an inconsistency not\nto be excused.\"  James Otis maintained that the same arguments which were\nused to defend the rights of the colonists against Britain could be used\nwith at least equal force against the colonists by their slaves.  \"It is\na clear truth,\" he said, \"that those who every day barter away other\nmen's liberty will soon care little for their own.\"\n\nIn the same vein, Abigail Adams wrote her husband: \"It always appeared a\nmost iniquitous scheme to me to fight ourselves for what we are daily\nrobbing and plundering from those who have as good a right to freedom as\nwe have.\"  Perhaps the most radical statement was made by the Reverend\nIsaac Skillman in 1773.  Again, comparing the struggle of the colonists\nwith that of the slaves, he said that it was in conformity with natural\nlaw that a slave could rebel against his master.\n\nIn 1774 the Continental Congress did agree to a temporary termination of\nthe importation of Africans into the colonies, but, in reality, this was\na tactical blow against the British slave trade and not an attack against\nslavery itself.  In an early draft of the Declaration of Independence,\nthe British king was attacked for his in involvement in the slave trade,\nand he was charged with going against human nature by violating the\nsacred rights of life and liberty.  However, this section was deleted.\nApparently, Southern delegates feared that this condemnation of the\nmonarch reflected on them as well.\n\nAlthough neither slavery nor the slave trade was mentioned in the\nDeclaration, it did maintain that all men were created equal and endowed\nwith the right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  This\nseeming ambivalence concerning the future of slavery on the part of the\nContinental Congress left Samuel Johnson's ironic question about American\nhypocrisy unanswered.  From a logical point of view, the Declaration of\nIndependence either affirmed the freedom of the African immigrant, or it\ndenied his humanity.  Because each state continued almost as a separate\nsovereign entity, the Declaration of Independence became a philosophical\nabstraction, and the status of the African in America was determined\nindependently by each.\n\nLord Dunmore, the British governor of Virginia, put teeth into Johnson's\nbitter question.  In 1775 he offered to grant freedom to any slave who\nran away from his master and joined the British army.  Earlier that year,\nin spite of the fact that both slaves and free men had served at\nLexington and Concord, the colonists had shown an increasing reluctance\nto have any blacks serving in their Army.  The Council of War, under\nWashington's leadership, had unanimously rejected the enlistment of\nslaves and, by a large majority, it had opposed their recruitment\naltogether.  However, the eager response of many slaves to Lord Dunmore's\ninvitation gradually compelled the colonists to reconsider their stand.\nAlthough many colonists felt that the use of slaves was inconsistent with\nthe principles for which the Army was fighting, all the colonies, with\nthe exception of Georgia and South Carolina, eventually recruited slaves\nas well as freedmen.  In most cases, slaves were granted their freedom at\nthe end of their military service.  During the war some five thousand\nblacks served in the Continental Army with the vast majority coming from\nthe North.\n\nIn contrast to later practice, during the Revolution the armed services\nwere largely integrated with only a few segregated units.  While the vast\nmajority of Afro-American troops fighting in the Revolutionary War will\nalways remain anonymous, there were several who achieved distinction and\nmade their mark in history.  Both Prince Whipple and Oliver Cromwell\ncrossed the Delaware with Washington on Christmas Day in 1776.  Lemuel\nHaynes, later a pastor of a white church, served at the Battle of\nTiconderoga.  According to many reports, Peter Salem killed the British\nmajor, John Pitcairn, at the Battle of Bunker Hill.\n\nGradually, the colonies were split into two sections by differing\nattitudes towards slavery.  In 1780 the Pennsylvania Legislature passed a\nlaw providing for the gradual abolition of slavery.  The Preamble to the\nlegislation argued that, considering that America had gone to war for its\nown freedom, it should share that blessing with those who were being\nsubjected to a similar state of bondage in its midst.  Three years later\nthe Massachusetts Supreme Court decided that slavery was contrary to that\nstate's constitution and that it violated the natural rights of man.\nConnecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and New York all passed laws\nproviding for gradual emancipation.  Although the liberal philosophy of\nthe revolution did lead these states to end slavery, most Northern\ncitizens were not genuinely convinced that natural law had conferred full\nequality on their Afro-American neighbors.  Racial discrimination\nremained widespread.\n\nAt the same time, the Southern states which were dependent on slavery for\ntheir economic prosperity showed little interest in applying the\ndoctrines of the Declaration of Independence to either the slaves or the\nfree blacks in their midst.  If anything, the passage of stiffer black\ncodes increased the rights of the masters while diminishing those of\nslaves and freedmen.  Some Southern states had qualms about the\nadvisability of continuing the slave trade, but this did not mean that\nthey had doubts about the value of slavery.  Rather, the number of slave\ninsurrections which swept through South America, highlighted by the\nbloody revolt in Haiti, led them to fear possible uprisings at home.\nThey had always been cautious about bringing unbroken slaves directly\nfrom Africa, and now they were also afraid to import unruly slaves from\nSouth America.\n\nIn 1783 Maryland passed a law prohibiting the importation of slaves, and\nin 1786 North Carolina drastically increased the duty on the importation\nof slaves, thereby severely reducing the flow.  The Federal Government\nfinally took action to terminate the slave trade in 1807, but a vigorous,\nillegal trade continued until the Civil War.  The first sectional\nconflict over slavery had taken place at the Constitutional Convention.\nThose Northerners who had hoped to see slavery abolished by this new\nconstitution were quick to realize that such a document would never be\napproved by the South.  Most of the antislavery forces concluded that it\nwas necessary to put the Union above abolition.\n\nWhile the Constitution did not specifically mention slavery, it did\nlegally recognize the institution in three places.  First, there was a\nheated debate over the means of calculating representation to the House.\nSouthern spokesmen wanted as many delegates as possible and preferred\nthat slaves be counted.  Northerners, wanting to restrict Southern\nrepresentation, insisted that slaves not be counted.  Some of them\npointed out that it was an insult to whites to be put on an equal footing\nwith slaves.  The compromise which was framed in Article I, Section 2,\nwas that a slave should be counted as three-fifths of a man.\n\nSecond, the antislavery elements tried to make their stand at the\nconvention by attacking the slave trade.  However, while many Southern\nstates were opposed to the trade, the issue became entangled in power\npolitics.  South Carolina, which had few slaves, believed that the\ntermination of the slave trade would force up the price of slaves and\nplace her at a severe disadvantage in comparison with Virginia which\nalready had a large slave supply.  It argued that Virginia would be\nartificially enriched to the disadvantage of the other Southern states.\nThe states of the North and middle South were again forced to compromise,\nand, in Article II, Section 9, they agreed that the trade would be\npermitted to continue for another twenty years.\n\nThe third capitulation occurred in Article IV, Section 2, which as the\nFugitive Slave Provision.  It stated that a slave who ran away and\nreached a free state, did not thereby obtain his freedom.  Instead, that\nstate was required, at the master's request, to seize and return him.\n\nIn fact, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention were afraid that\nthe revolutionary ideology of freedom and equality had unwisely and\nunintentionally unleashed a social revolution.  Southern planters\nenvisioned the end of slavery on which their wealth was based.  Northern\ncapitalists were opposed to the liberal and democratic land laws which\nthe people were demanding.  The economic leaders in both sections of the\ncountry believed that there was a need to protect property rights against\nthese new revolutionary human rights.  While the Northern states strove\nto stabilize society in order to build a flourishing commerce, the\nSouthern states tightened their control over their slaves fearing that\ninsurrections from South America or ideas about freedom and equality from\nthe American Revolution itself might inspire a serious slave rebellion.\n\n\nSlave Insurrections\n\nFrom the time that the first African was captured until the completion of\nEmancipation, slaves struck out against the institution in one way or\nanother.  Herbert Aptheker has recorded over hundred insurrections.\nAlthough most slave revolts in America were small and ineffective, there\nwere three in particular which chilled Southern hearts.  These were led\nby Gabriel Prosser, Denmark Vesey, and Nat Turner and occurred within the\nshort span between 1800 and 1831.  Toussaint l'Ouverture in Haiti had\npreviously demonstrated that slaves could be victorious over large\nEuropean armies, and the American colonists had taught by their example\nin the American Revolution that violence in the service of freedom was\njustifiable.  The gradual abolition of slavery which was occurring in the\nNorthern states gave hope that the institution in America might be\nterminated altogether.  However, the slaves saw little reason to believe\nthat their Southern masters would follow the example of the Northerners\nin abolishing slavery.  Many of the slaves came to accept that if the\ninstitution was to be destroyed, it would have to be done by the slaves\nthemselves.\n\nIn August, 1800, Gabriel Prosser led a slave attack on Richmond,\nVirginia.  During several months of careful planning and organizing, the\ninsurrectionists had gathered clubs, swords, and other crude weapons.\nThe intention was to divide into three columns: one to attack the\npenitentiary which was being used as an arsenal, another to capture the\npowder house, and a third to attack the city itself.  If the citizens\nwould not surrender, the rebels planned to kill all of the whites with\nthe exception of Quakers, Methodists, and Frenchman.  Apparently, Prosser\nand his followers shared a deep distrust of most white men. When they had\ngathered a large supply of guns and powder, and taken over the state's\ntreasury, the rebels calculated, they would be able to hold out for\nseveral weeks.  What they hoped for was that slaves from the surrounding\nterritory would join them and, eventually, that the uprising would reach\nsuch proportions as to compel the whites to come to terms with them.\n\nUnfortunately for the plotters, on the day of the insurrection a severe\nstorm struck Virginia, wiping out roads and bridges.  This forced a delay\nof several days.  In the meantime, two slaves betrayed the plot, and the\ngovernment took swift action.  Thirty-five of the participants, including\nProsser, were executed.  As the leaders refused to divulge any details of\ntheir plans, the exact number involved in the plot remains unknown.\nHowever, rumor had it that somewhere between two thousand and fifty\nthousand slaves were connected with the conspiracy.  During the trials,\none of the rebels said that he had done nothing more than what Washington\nhad done, that he had ventured his life for his countrymen, and that he\nwas a willing sacrifice.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, a young slave named Denmark Vesey won\n$1,500 in a lottery with which he purchased his freedom.  During the\nfollowing years he worked as a carpenter.  In his concern over the plight\nof his slave brethren, he formed a plan for an insurrection which would\nbring them their freedom.  He and other freedmen collected two hundred\npike heads and bayonets as well as three hundred daggers to use in the\nrevolt, but, before the plans could be put into motion in 1882, a slave\ninformed on them.  This time it was rumored that there had been some nine\nthousand involved in the plot.  Over a hundred arrests were made,\nincluding four whites who had encouraged the project, and several of the\nleaders, including Vesey, were executed.\n\nThe bloodiest insurrection of all, in which some sixty whites were\nmurdered, occurred in Southampton County, Virginia, in August, 1831.  Nat\nTurner, its leader, besides being a skilled carpenter, was a literate,\nmystical preacher.  He had discovered particular relevance in the\nprophets of the Old Testament.  Besides identifying with the slave\nexperience of the Israelites, Turner and other slaves felt that the\nsocial righteousness which the prophets preached related directly to\ntheir situation.  The picture of the Lord exercising vengeance against\nthe oppressors gave them hope and inspiration.  While the Bible did\nappear to tell the slave to be faithful and obedient to his master, it\nalso condemned the wicked and provided examples that could be interpreted\nto prove God's willingness to use human instruments in order to bring\njustice against oppressors.  Turner's growing hatred of slavery and his\nincreasing concern for the plight of his brothers, led him to believe he\nwas one of God's chosen instruments.\n\nAs his conviction deepened, the solar eclipse early in 1831 appeared to\nhim to be a sign that the day of vengeance was at hand.  In the following\nmonths he collected a small band of followers, and in August they went\ninto action.  Unlike Prosser and Vesey, he began with only a very small\nband which lessened his chance of betrayal.  As they moved from farm to\nfarm, slaughtering the white inhabitants, they were joined by many of the\nslaves who were freed in the process.  However, word of the massacre\nspread.  At one farm, they were met by armed resistance.  Slaves as well\nas masters fought fiercely to stop the attack.  Some of Turner's men were\nkilled and wounded, and the planned drive towards Jerusalem was thrown\noff stride.  This enabled the militia to arrive and break up the attack.\nIn due time Turner and several of his followers were captured and\nexecuted.\n\nWhite men in both the South and the North saw little similarity between\nthese insurrections and the American Revolution.  The Turner massacre was\nuniversally depicted as the work of savages and brutes, not of men.\nVigilance was tightened, and new laws controlling the slaves were passed\nthroughout the South.  Both the violence of the slaves and the verbal\nabuse of the abolitionists only served to strengthen the South in its\ndefense of the peculiar institution.  Slaves who revolted were depicted\nas beasts who could not be freed because they would endanger society.\nSubmissive slaves were pictured as children in need of paternal\nprotection from the evils of a complex, modern world.  They were never\nseen as men whose rights and liberties had been proclaimed in the\nDeclaration of Independence.\n\n\nGrowing Racism\n\nAs Afro-American freedmen sought to claim their rights as men and\ncitizens, they were confronted with constant resistance from whites who\nwere unwilling to accept them.  Actually, pressure from the mass of\nNorthern white workers had contributed to abolition of slavery in those\nstates.  In the Northern states slavery was forced to compete with free\nwhite labor in a way which was not true of the plantation economy of the\nSouth.  White workers continually complained that slavery was keeping\ntheir wages down and unemployment up, and in 1737 the governor of New\nYork had asked the Legislature to investigate the charges that slave\ncompetition contributed to unemployment.  While this attack had helped to\nundermine slavery, it had also exacerbated tension between black and\nwhite labor.  The continual flow of runaways from the South brought an\nincreasing supply of cheap black labor to compete with white workers, and\nthe friction between the two races continued.  While many of the\nrunaways, like Frederick Douglass, had worked as skilled craftsmen in the\nSouth, they found economic discrimination in the North limiting them to\nmenial labor.\n\nAfter 1830, when the tide of European immigration began to swell, the\ncompetition for jobs grew even sharper, and blacks found that even menial\njobs were being taken over by the new European immigrants.  Jobs such as\nstevedores, coachmen, barbers, and servants, which had traditionally been\nleft to blacks, were now being invaded by the Irish.  Whereas in 1830 the\nvast majority of New York City servants were Afro-American, after 1850\nmost of them were Irish.  This economic competition contributed\nconsiderably to the hostility, fear, and discrimination which confronted\nthe Northern freedmen.\n\nIn 1816 the American Colonization Society was founded.  It was considered\nthe ideal solution to the American racial dilemma.  Claiming to be\ninterested in the welfare of the African in its midst, the Society\nadvocated colonizing in Africa or wherever else it was expedient.  It\ncomforted slave owners by announcing that it was not concerned with\neither emancipation or amelioration.  Both were outside its jurisdiction.\nIt did imply that slaves might eventually be purchased for colonization.\nMost of its propaganda tried to demonstrate that the freedman lived in a\nwretched state of poverty, immorality, and ignorance and that he would be\nbetter off in Africa.\n\nThe movement received widespread support from almost all sectors of the\nwhite community including presidents Madison and Jackson.  Several state\nlegislatures supported the idea, and Congress voted $100,000 to finance\nthe plan which eventually led to the establishment of the Republic of\nLiberia.\n\nHowever, the Afro-American community was not very enthusiastic about the\nproject.  In 1817 three thousand blacks crowded into the Bethel Church in\nPhiladelphia and, led by Richard Allen, vehemently criticized\ncolonization.  They charged that the Society's propaganda only served to\nincrease racial discrimination since it stressed the poverty and\nignorance of the freedman and claimed he was doomed to continue in his\nfilth and degradation because of his natural inferiority.  It also argued\nthat whites would only take advantage of the Afro-American, and that the\nseparation of the two races was the only solution.  The participants at\nthe Bethel meeting contended that this propaganda tended to justify\nracial discrimination.\n\nThe claim was also made that the removal of freedmen from America would\nonly serve to make the slave system more secure, and they pledged\nthemselves never to abandon their slave brothers.  Besides, while they\nwere African by heritage, they had been born in America, and it was now\ntheir home.  Most of the fifteen thousand who did return to Africa were\nslaves who had been freed for this purpose, and the project was\nacknowledged to be a failure.  The Society's own propaganda contributed\nto the alienation of many freedmen.  One of its own leaders admitted that\nlacks could read and hear and, when they were spoken of as a nuisance to\nbe banished, they reacted negatively like men.\n\nWidespread racial prejudice, besides creating racial discrimination,\nresulted in oppressive legislation.  In 1810 Congress excluded\nAfro-Americans from carrying the mail.  In 1820 it authorized the\nDistrict of Columbia to elect white city officials, and it consistently\nadmitted new states to the Union whose constitutions severely limited the\nrights of freedmen.  The office of the Attorney General usually took the\nposition that the Constitution did not grant citizenship to Negroes, and\nCongress itself had limited naturalization to white aliens in 1790.  This\npoint of view was later justified by the Dred Scott decision.  With only\na few exceptions, the Secretary of State refused to grant passports to\nthose wishing to travel abroad, although it did provide a letter of\nidentification stating that the carrier was a resident of the United\nStates.  Finally, Massachusetts granted its own passports to its colored\ncitizens, complaining that they had been virtually denationalized.\n\nAlso, many states in the Northwest passed laws prohibiting or limiting\nthe migration of Afro-Americans into their territory.  An Illinois law\nsaid that anyone who entered the state illegally could be whipped and\nsold at auction.  Many states denied blacks the ballot, prohibited their\nserving on a jury and legally segregated transportation, restaurants,\nhotels, theaters, churches, and even cemeteries.  Most Northern states\ndid not allow them to testify in court against whites.  This meant that,\nif a white man beat a black, the black had no legal protection unless\nanother white was willing to testify on his behalf.\n\nOn several occasions white hostility erupted into violence.  Black\nworkmen were harassed, abolitionists beaten, and entire communities\nterrorized.  One of the worst of these events occurred in Cincinnati in\n1829.  With the rapid growth of \"Little Africa,\" that city's black\nghetto, the local citizens decided to enforce the state's\nanti-integration legislation.  Some twenty years before, the state had\npassed a law requiring blacks entering the state to provide proof of\ntheir freedom and to post a bond as guarantee of their good behavior.\nWhen the inhabitants of \"Little Africa\" obtained an extension of the\n30-day time limit within which they were to comply with the law, the\ncitizens of Cincinnati were outraged, and they took matters into their\nown hands.  White mobs ransacked the area, indiscriminately and\nmercilessly beating women and children, looting stores and burning\nhouses.  It was estimated that half of the two thousand inhabitants of\nthe area left the city.  Many of them emigrated to Canada, and the local\npaper, which had helped to inflame the mob, lamented that the respectable\nblack citizens had left and only derelicts remained.\n\nAt the very point in American history when democracy was sinking its\nroots deeper into the national soil, the status of the Afro-American was\nbeing clearly defined as an inferior one.  The Jacksonian Era brought the\ncommon man into new prominence, but the same privileges were not extended\nto the blacks.  In the South, society was strengthening the institution\nof slavery against any possible recurrences of slave insurrections.  The\nactivities of the slaves, especially those of Negro preachers, were being\nwatched even more closely than before.  In the North, both state and\nfederal laws denied blacks many of the rights of citizenship.\n\n\n\n\nPART TWO  Emancipation Without Freedom\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nA Nation Divided\n\n\nBlack Moderates And Black Militants\n\nOn the eve of the Revolution there was justification for assuming that\nslavery in the Northern states was withering away.  By 1800 most of the\nNorthern states had either done away with slavery or had made provision\nfor its gradual abolition. Although this might not change the status of\nan adult slave, he knew his children, when they reached maturity, would\nbe free. This meant that the important issue in the North was that of\nidentity.  What would be the place of Negroes who were not fully accepted\nas Americans?  While Northern states were willing to grant freedom to the\nAfro-Americans, they continued to view them as inferiors.  Many observers\nremarked that race prejudice actually increased with the abolition of\nslavery.  Northern freedmen concluded, like their slave brothers in the\nSouth, that they would have to work out their own salvation. This left\nthem to wrestle with such questions as: \"Am I an American?\" \"Am I an\nAfrican?\" \"Am I inferior?\" \"How can I establish my manhood and gain\nacceptance?\"\n\nIn the years immediately preceding the Revolution, there were slaves who\nhad wrestled with some of these questions: Jupiter Hammon and Phillis\nWheatley. They tried to establish their claim to manhood through literary\nability.  Both were poets and wrote romantic poetry in the spirit of the\nday. In 1761 Jupiter Hammon, a Long Island slave, published his poem: \"An\nEvening Thought. Salvation by Christ with Penitential Cries\". Twelve\nyears later Phillis Wheatley published a slim volume of poetry which was\nwritten in a style much like that of Alexander Pope.  Born in Africa in\n1753, she had been brought to America as a child and had served in the\nWheatley home in Boston. When she displayed some literary ability, her\nmaster granted freedom to her and, to some extent, became her patron. Her\nvolume of poetry was published while she was visiting England and is\ngenerally considered superior to the poetry of Jupiter Hammon. Although\non one occasion Hammon did suggest that slavery was evil, he instructed\nslaves to bear it with patience. Neither he nor Phillis Wheatley made any\ndirect challenge to race prejudice.  Instead, they strove to gain\nacceptance as talented individuals who might help others of their race to\nimprove their situation.  Unfortunately, white society regarded them only\nas unusual individual exceptions and continued to maintain its racial\nviews.\n\nGustavus Vassa was born in Africa in 1745 and was brought to America as a\nslave. Eventually, after serving several masters, he became the property\nof a Philadelphia merchant who let him buy his own freedom.  After\nworking for some time as a sailor, he settled in England, where he felt\nhe would encounter less racial discrimination. There he became an active\nworker in the British anti-slavery movement. In 1789 he published his\nautobiography, \"The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Oloudah Equiano,\nor Gustavus Vassa\", in which he bitterly attacked Christians for\nparticipating in the slave trade.\n\nIn 1792, Benjamin Banneker, a freedman from Maryland, wrote to Thomas\nJefferson complaining that it was time to eradicate false racial\nstereotypes. While expressing doubts regarding the merits of slavery in\nhis \"Notes on Virginia\", Jefferson had expressed his belief in the\ninferiority of the African. Banneker had educated himself, especially in\nmathematics and astronomy, and in 1789 he was one of those who helped to\nsurvey the District of Columbia.  Later, he predicted a solar eclipse. In\n1791 he had begun the publication of a series of almanacs, and the next\nyear he sent one of these to Jefferson in an attempt to challenge his\nracial views.  Jefferson was so impressed with the work that he sent it\nto the French Academy of Science. However, he seemed to view Banneker as\nan exception rather than fresh evidence undermining white stereotypes.\n\nIn Massachusetts Paul Cuffe was rapidly becoming a black capitalist.\nAfter having worked as a sailor, he managed to buy a business of his own.\nOver the years, he came to own considerable property in Boston, and\neventually he had an entire fleet of ships sailing along the Atlantic\ncoast, visiting the Caribbean and crossing the ocean to Africa. During\nthe Revolution, he and his brother, both of whom owned property and paid\ntaxes, raised the question of political rights.  Claiming \"no taxation\nwithout representation\", they both refused to pay their taxes because\nthey were denied the ballot. Their protest led Massachusetts to permit\nblacks to vote on the same basis as whites.  Nevertheless, over the years\nCuffe developed reservations about the future of the African in America.\nIn 1815, at his own expense, he transported thirty-eight blacks back to\nAfrica. This was one of the first attempts at African colonization.\nApparently the costs and other problems surrounding the project were so\ngreat that he never pursued it further.\n\nAs it became increasingly apparent that the end of slavery would not mean\nthe end of discrimination, cooperative action by Afro-Americans seemed to\nbe the only basis from which to gain acceptance, and in 1775 the African\nLodge No. 459, the first Afro-American Masonic lodge in America, was\nfounded. Prince Hall, its founder, was born in Barbados and came to\nAmerica with the idea of identifying himself with Afro-Americans. He\nbecame a minister in the Methodist Church, where he dedicated himself to\ntheir advancement. However, he concluded that only through working\ntogether through black cooperation, could any progress be made.  After\nbeing refused recognition by the American masons, his lodge was\nlegitimized by a branch of the British Masons connected with army\nstationed in Boston. Before long African lodges as well as other\nfraternal organizations sprang up all across the country.  Denied access\nto white society, blacks found it necessary to form various kinds of\norganizations for their own welfare.\n\nEven within the church which supposedly stressed brotherhood, separate\nAfrican organizations were emerging. During the revolution, George Liele\nfounded a black Baptist church in Savannah, Georgia. Although similar\nchurches sprang up throughout the South, the independent church movement\nprogressed more rapidly in the Northern states. In 1786 Richard Allen,\nwho had previously purchased his freedom from his Delaware master, began\nsimilar meetings among his own people in Philadelphia. He wanted to found\na separate black church, but he was opposed by Blacks and whites alike.\nHowever, when the officials of St.  George's Methodist Church proposed\nsegregating the congregation, events came to a head. Richard Allen,\nAbsalom Jones, and others went to the gallery as directed, but the ushers\neven objected to their sitting in the front seats of the gallery. When\nthey were pulled from their knees during prayer, Allen and his friends\nleft the church, never to return.  They immediately formed the Free\nAfrican Society and began collecting funds to build a church.  This\nresulted in the founding of St. Thomas' African Protestant Episcopal\nChurch headed by Absalom Jones. In spite of the behavior of the\nMethodists, Allen believed that Methodism was better suited to his\npeople's style of worship and gradually he collected a community of\nfollowers. In 1794 the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church was\nopened in Philadelphia.  In 1816 several A.M.E. congregations met\ntogether to form a national organization with Allen as its bishop.\nSimilar events in New York City led to the establishment of the African\nMethodist Episcopal Zion Church. Early in 1807 a black Baptist Church was\nfounded in Philadelphia, and later in that same year congregations were\nestablished in Boston and New York.  The New York congregation developed\ninto the Abyssinian Baptist Church.\n\nThe African church became the most important organization within the\nAfro-American community. Besides providing spiritual strength and\ncomfort, it became a community institution, a center for social,\npolitical, and economic life. The minister became the most important\nleader of his people. However, the full potential for organizing protest\nwas overlooked. For the most part, the church taught an other-worldly\nreligion which strove to provide strength with which to endure the\nsorrows of this life, but it did not try too actively to change the\nsituation. Richard Allen, for example, counseled patience and caution,\nadvising his people to wait for God to work in His own way. In the\nmeantime, the Christian was to practice obedience to God and to his\nmaster.  Most of the clergy stuck to religious matters and avoided\npolitical questions.  However, there were those who took an active part\nin politics, and they became leaders in the abolition movement and in the\nNegro Convention movement. They included men like Samuel Ringgold Ward\nand Henry Highland Garnet.\n\nAnother manifestation of group solidarity occurred in the Negro\nConvention Movement which began in 1830 and continued until the Civil\nWar. These meetings brought together leaders from Afro-American\ncommunities throughout the North. They debated important problems,\ndeveloped common policies, and spoke out with a united voice. They\nconsistently urged the abolition of slavery in the Southern states, and\nthey condemned the legal and social discrimination which was rampant\nthroughout the North. At the 1843 convention in Buffalo, N.Y., Henry\nHighland Garnet tried to persuade the movement to declare violence an\nacceptable tool in the destruction of slavery. However, by a vote of 19\nto 15, the movement continued to oppose violence and to limit its power\nto an appeal based on moral persuasion.\n\nBesides the Convention Movement, there were two other means of achieving\nbroad leadership. This was still an age of oratory.  Frederick Douglass,\nWilliam Wells Brown, Sojourner Truth, and many others traveled from town\nto town and state to state giving lectures to both black and white\naudiences. Also, they exploited the press to reach even larger numbers.\nSome of the more famous autobiographies written at this time were those\nof Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, Austin Steward, and Josiah\nHenson, all of whom recorded the horrors of slavery as well as the\nhumiliations of racial discrimination.\n\nOne of the most vehement attacks against slavery and discrimination was\n\"Walker's Appeal in Four Articles Together with a Preamble to the Colored\nCitizens of the World But in Particular and Very Particularly to those of\nthe United States of America\".  Although his  father had been a slave,\nDavid Walker himself was born free in North Carolina. His hatred of\nslavery drove him to Boston, where he became a clothing merchant, but he\nwas unable to forget his brethren who were still in bondage. The result\nwas that in 1829, he published a pamphlet which was both a vehement\nattack against the institution of slavery and an open invitation for the\nslaves to rise up in arms.\n\nFirst, he pointed out that all races of the earth were called men and\nassumed to be free with the sole exception of the Africans.  He denied\nthat his people wished to be white, insisting rather that they preferred\nto be just as their creator had made them.  Urging his brothers not to\nshow fear because God was on their side, Walker contended that any man\nwho was not willing to fight for his freedom deserved to remain in\nslavery and to be butchered by his captors.  Insisting that death was\npreferable to slavery, he insisted that, if an uprising occurred, the\nslaves would have to be willing to kill or be killed. Moreover, he urged\nthat it was no worse to kill a man in self-defense than it was to take a\ndrink of water when thirsty. Rather, a man who would not defend himself\nwas worse than an infidel, and not deserving of pity.\n\nIn addressing the American people, Walker foresaw that if they would\ntreat Africans as men, they could all live together in harmony. Georgia\noffered $10,000 for Walker if taken alive and $1,000 for him dead. A year\nlater Walker died under somewhat mysterious circumstances, and some\nclaimed that he had been murdered. His pamphlet circulated widely\nthroughout the North and the South, and many believed that it helped to\nencourage slave insurrections.\n\n\"Freedoms Journal\", which had been founded in 1827 by Samuel E.  Cornish\nand John B. Russwurm, was the first in a long series of Afro-American\nnewspapers. Russwurm had been the first of his race to receive a college\ndegree in America. In their first editorial, they proclaimed what was\nbecoming a growing conviction. They said that others had spoken for the\nblack man for too long. It was time that he spoke for himself. They also\nattacked slavery and racial prejudice.  They strove to make the paper a\nmedium for communication and debate within the Afro-American community.\nThey also intended to use the paper to clarify misconceptions about\nAfrica. Like many of their contemporaries, Cornish and Russwurm believed\nthat even those who were friendly to their race were unconsciously\nsteeped in prejudice.  Therefore, it was doubly necessary for\nAfro-Americans to speak out for themselves, to expose the prejudices of\nbigots and liberals. However, by 1829 Russwurm had become increasingly\nbitter about the future of his race in America and came to believe that\nreturning to Africa was the only way to escape prejudice. He believed\nthat the colony which had been established in Liberia was in need of\neducated leadership, and he went there to become its superintendent of\neducation. Cornish remained behind and continued to work as a minister\nand as a newspaper editor.\n\nThe \"North Star\", later known as Frederick Douglass's paper, was the best\nknown of the black journals. Its editor, Frederick Douglass, was born a\nslave in Maryland in 1817. His mother was a slave named Harriet Bailey,\nand the identity of his white father remains unknown. He was raised by\nhis maternal grandmother on a distant farm and almost never saw his\nmother. Like many slaves, he was denied a father, almost denied a mother,\nand largely denied any meaningful identity. After working for several\nyears as a slave both on the plantation and in the city, he determined to\nrun away. Although an earlier attempt had failed, he now made his way\nnorth to New Bedford, Massachusetts. There he was shocked to discover\nthat, while some whites gave him protection and help, race prejudice was\nstill rampant. A skilled craftsman, he was unable to find work. When an\nemployer was willing to accept him, his fellow workers threatened to walk\noff the job. For the next three years, he worked as servant, coachman,\nand common laborer earning about a dollar a day.\n\nThen, he met William Lloyd Garrison, the famous white abolitionist, who\nwas impressed with his slave experiences and his ability to describe\nthem. At one meeting, after Douglass had spoken, Garrison asked the\naudience whether this was a beast or a man. Douglass soon became a\nregular lecturer in the abolitionist movement. As he traveled throughout\nthe North, he was continually harassed by racial discrimination in\ntrains, coaches, boats, restaurants hotels, and other public places. In\ncontrast, when he went to England to raise funds for the movement, he was\nstruck by the fact that he could go any place, including places\nfrequented by the aristocracy, and be accepted as a man. He said that\nwherever he went in England he could always identify an American because\nhis race prejudice clung to him like clothing.  While in England,\nabolitionists raised funds which allowed him to purchase his freedom.\n\nWhen he returned to America, Douglass settled in Rochester, New York,\nwhere he began publication of \"The North Star\". Rochester was a thriving\ncity on the Erie Canal, and, because it also had a port on Lake Ontario,\nit became an important terminal on the Underground Railroad. While many\nrunaways settled in Rochester, others boarded steamers for Canada where\nthey would be beyond the reach of the law.  Douglass came to play an\nimportant role on the Underground Railroad, in the life of Rochester and,\nthrough \"The North Star\", among Northern freedmen. Garrison felt\ndouble-crossed when his most important cohort in the Afro-American\ncommunity struck out on his own. Douglass, in agreement with the position\npreviously taken by Cornish and Russwurm, believed that blacks must\nassume leadership in their own cause.\n\nBefore long, \"The North Star\" was recognized as the voice of the black\nman in America. Douglass spoke out on all issues through its pages, and\nhe continued to tour the country lecturing before audiences of both\ncolors and discussing matters of policy with other abolitionists. He did\nnot believe in merely exercising patience and obedience. Rather, he\nbelieved it was necessary to prick the white man's conscience with moral\npersuasion. His tactics combined nonviolence with self-assertion.\nAlthough the Constitution had indirectly recognized slavery, Douglass\nbelieved that its spirit, as well as that of the American Revolution,\nimplied the eventual destruction of that institution. Therefore,\npolitical action was a legitimate and necessary tool with which to attack\nslavery and racial discrimination. From his knowledge of the South, he\nwas convinced that slavery could not be overthrown without violence.\nHowever, he insisted that the black man was in no position to take the\nleadership in the use of physical force. At the same time, he was\nincreasingly aware of the depth of racial prejudice of Northern whites,\nand he knew that there was a long struggle ahead to gain political,\nsocial, and economic freedom.\n\n\nWhite Liberals\n\nIn 1832 William Lloyd Garrison and eleven other whites founded the New\nEngland Anti-Slavery Society which, besides working for the abolition of\nslavery, fought for the rights of freedmen. Garrison soon became the\nfiery and controversial leader of the abolitionist movement and the\neditor of \"The Liberator\". The movement included men like Wendell\nPhillips, Arthur and Lewis Tappan, Theodore Dwight Weld, Gerrit Smith,\nJames Birney, and many others. They condemned the American Colonization\nSociety for sharing the unchristian prejudices of the slaveholders.\nAlthough the Northern states had abolished slavery, most whites believed\nthat it was not their business to interfere with the domestic affairs of\nthe Southern states. They also held that freedmen in the North must be\nkept in their place, and they viewed the abolitionists as a dangerous and\nradical minority.\n\nThe abolition movement itself was weakened by internal fragmentation.\nGarrison was jealous of anyone who competed with him for leadership.  His\nbrand of abolitionism attacked the Constitution as a vicious document\ngiving sanction to slavery. He advocated that the Northern states\nseparate from the South as a means of removing federal protection from\nslavery. Because the government was based on an unholy document, he\nconcluded that any kind of political action automatically enmeshed one in\nthis evil system. He was vehemently against the use of violence to\noverthrow slavery and insisted that moral persuasion was the only\nlegitimate tool in the cause. Anyone who did not support his doctrines\nfaithfully was viewed as an enemy. This meant that he did not cooperate\nwith abolitionists who condoned the use of violence or with those who\nwere willing to accept the Constitution and engage in political action.\n\nIronically, the abolitionist movement was also divided by racial\nprejudice. While opposing slavery, some refused to believe in political\nequality. Others were willing to grant political equality, but resisted\nthe idea of social mixing.   The Philadelphia anti-slavery society spent\nmany meetings debating whether it should extend membership to blacks,\nand, by a majority of two, it finally voted to drop its color bar.\n\nBlack abolitionists became increasingly irritated by the racial attitudes\nof their white colleagues. Many of the whites were influential\nbusinessmen, and they were attacked for their own hiring practices. It\nwas claimed that, when they hired blacks at all, they hired them only in\nmenial positions. Martin R. Delany, abolitionist, journalist, and\nphysician, complained that the blacks had taken a back seat in the\nmovement for too long. He also bitterly attacked whites for thinking that\nthey knew best what was good for the African. He concluded that both\nfriend and foe shared the same prejudices.\n\nThe Underground Railroad was another project which involved large numbers\nof whites. Besides providing financial backing for it, they worked as\nconductors and station masters. They helped runaways to safety, and they\nsheltered escapees. These men wanted to do more than speak out on the\nissue of slavery; they wanted to take action.  Helping runaway slaves was\nagainst the law, and these men had such strong convictions that, while\nthey did not think of themselves as criminals, they were willing to\ndeliberately break the law. They participated in a kind of civil\ndisobedience. However, the bravest workers on the underground railroad\nwere black. If they were caught, especially in the South, they would have\nto pay the ultimate price for their heroism. The best known of all the\nblack conductors was a brave runaway slave woman named Harriet Tubman.\nShe ventured deep into the South on several occasions to lead large\nnumbers of slaves to freedom, and she became a national legend. Several\nstates put a price on her head. During the Civil War she served as a\nUnion spy behind confederate lines.\n\nGradually the abolitionist movement and the Underground Railroad won the\nsupport of ever-increasing numbers of white Northerners. At the same\ntime, the South became increasingly bitter.  Abolitionist literature was\nbanned throughout the South, and most of the abolitionist leaders,\nbecause they had circulated literature in violation of this ban, had a\nprice put on their heads. The Underground Railroad was more than a\nsymbolic attack on the institution of slavery.  While there is no way of\ntelling how many slaves traveled to freedom with its help, certainly the\nvalue of human property lost to the South was very high. A slave was\nworth about $1,000, and thousands of slaves escaped. The financial loss\nwas very real. When Southern masters came north to recapture runaway\nslaves, Northern consciences were outraged.\n\nFinally, as the new states from the West were being permitted to join the\nUnion, the question as to whether slavery should be legalized in them\nbecame important. Even Northern white bigots opposed the extension of\nslavery into these states. From their point of view, slavery was unfair\ncompetition with free labor, and they wanted the new states for the\npurpose of expansion. As the middle of the century approached, dark\nclouds of crisis could be seen on the horizon.\n\nGrowth of Extremism\n\nDuring the 1850s American racial attitudes grew more extreme.  While\nslavery continued to flourish throughout the South, discrimination was\nrampant throughout the North. Instead of gradually withering away as some\nhad expected, the peculiar institution had been thriving and spreading\ninto the Southwest ever since Eli Whitney's discovery of the cotton gin\nin 1793 had given new life to the growing of cotton. Slavery was booming\nin Alabama and spreading into Louisiana, Mississippi, and even Texas. At\nthe same time, the North, after experiencing a full decade without\nslavery, was still steeped in discrimination and prejudice. After several\nyears of freedom, Northern blacks still were not gaining economic\nadvancement, political rights, or social acceptance. As the numbers of\nEuropean immigrants had increased, job discrimination grew. The Northern\nstates were, at the same time, abolishing the political rights of\nAfro-Americans. The hopes which had accompanied the end of slavery in\nthose states were fading into despair. The relentless struggle for\nadvancement apparently had failed, and increasing numbers became\nconvinced that more radical action was necessary.\n\nAt the same time White supremacy advocates were uneasy because their\nviews had not been universally accepted, and they were adopting a\nstronger defense. The Southern justification of slavery was based on four\nmain arguments. First, it was claimed that slavery was indispensable to\nits economy and that every society, whether slave or free, needed those\nwho must do its menial labor. Although many Northerners might not agree\nthat the need for labor was a justification for slavery, many would\nconcur  with second argument, which was that the Negro was destined for a\nposition of inferiority. Here the racial prejudices of North and the\nSouth overlapped. The third argument was that Christianity had sanctioned\nslavery throughout all of history as a means for conversion. This\ncontention had more justification than the religious colonists would care\nto admit.  Finally, the South argued that white civilization had\ndeveloped a unique high culture precisely because slavery removed the\nburden from the white citizens. Again, while Northerners might not\ntotally agree with this point, many of them did believe in the\nsuperiority of white civilization. Although these points convinced few\noutsiders of the necessity for the existence of slavery, they did\nunderline the widespread belief in black inferiority and white\nsuperiority. From this point of view, the necessity for defending the\nglories of white civilization against the corruption of racial\ndegeneration justified more and more radical action.\n\nBesides mounting this vigorous vocal defense of slavery, the South\nstiffened its resistance to the circulation of anti-slavery propaganda.\nState laws were passed banning the publication and circulation of\nabolitionist materials, and mobs broke into post offices, confiscated\nliterature from the U.S. mail, and publicly burned it. The Compromise of\n1850, at the urging of the South, included the Fugitive Slave Act which\nvastly increased the powers of the slave owner to pursue runaway slaves\nthroughout the North. The law also required that Northern officials\ncooperate in this process. Afro-Americans who had been living in Northern\ncommunities for years and who were accepted as respected citizens were\nnow threatened with recapture by their previous masters.  Many of these\nleaders were forced to flee. Freedmen who lacked adequate identification\nwere also endangered by legal kidnapping and enslavement.\n\nThroughout the North both blacks and whites, with the aid of the Federal\nGovernment, were alienated by this new long arm of the peculiar\ninstitution which reached deep into their communities.  In fact many\nfelt, like Frederick Douglass, that this law made the Federal Government\nan agent of slavery, and they believed that it forced local governments\nto become its co-conspirators.  Several Northern states passed new civil\nrights laws in an attempt to protect their citizens.  Frequently local\nvigilance comittees tried to prevent the arrest of blacks in their midst.\nOn other occasions mobs tried and sometimes succeeded in freeing those\nalready arrested, In Boston, for example, a federal marshal was killed in\na clash with one such mob. The Fugitive Slave Act was a powerful blow at\nthe Afro-American communities in the North. It has been estimated that\nbetween 1850 and 1860 some twenty thousand fled to Canada. In the face of\nthis reversal moderation became meaningless.\n\nThe involvement of the Federal Government in supporting slavery led to a\ngrowing alienation within the Afro-American community.  Increasingly,\nmilitant leaders reevaluated their position on colonization. Henry\nHighland Garnet and Martin R. Delany, both workers in the abolition\nmovement, reversed their positions and became proponents of emigration.\nWhile Garnet favored emigration to Liberia, Delany became an advocate of\nmoving to Central and South America. He said that the United States had\nviolated its own principles of republicanism and equality and that it was\nkeeping Negroes in economic and political bondage. He concluded that\nNegroes were left with a choice between continued degradation in America\nor emigration. By 1852 he had come to prefer the latter choice.\n\nIn 1854 a colonization convention was held in Cleveland for those who\nwere interested in emigration within the boundaries of the western\nhemisphere. The convention noted that the Afro-American community was\ndeveloping a growing sense of racial consciousness and pride. Although\nblacks were in the minority in Europe and America, it pointed out that\nmost of the world's population was colored. Integration into the\nmainstream of American life, besides appearing to be impossible, seemed\nto demand the denial of selfhood for the black man. Therefore, black\nseparatism grew in popularity and became a platform from which to\nmaintain a sense of identity and individual worth.\n\nHowever, many militants like Frederick Douglass did not approve of black\nnationalism and colonization. They claimed that they were  still\nAmericans and did not constitute a separate nation.  Leaders who were not\nblack nationalists, however, could still be militant. Although Douglass\ndid not actively support John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, the reason\nfor his decision was that he doubted its effectiveness and not because he\nopposed its violent technique. In fact, Douglass applauded the attack. He\nsaid that Brown had attacked slavery \"with the weapons precisely adapted\nto bring it to the death,\" and he contended that, since slavery existed\nby \"brute force,\" then it was legitimate to turn its own weapons against\nit. Previously the  Reverend Moses Dixon had established two fraternal\norganizations to train blacks for military action. Although nothing\nsubstantial came from them, the idea of developing guerrilla forces as\nthe only remaining tool against slavery was gaining support.\n\nAnother militant, H. Ford Douglass, concluded that the government had\nbecome so tyrannical that it was possible for him to engage in military\naction against it without his becoming a traitor to his country. He said,\n\"I can hate this government without becoming disloyal because it has\nstricken down my manhood, and treated me as a salable commodity. I can\njoin a foreign enemy and fight against it, without being a traitor,\nbecause it treats me as an ALIEN and a STRANGER, and I am free to avow\nthat should such a contingency arise I should not hesitate to take any\nadvantage in order to procure such indemnity for the future.\"\n\nRobert Purvis, a Philadelphian, also agreed that revolution might be the\nonly tool left with which to secure redress for grievances. He contended\nthat to support the government and the constitution on which it was based\nwas to endorse a despotic state, and he went on to express his abhorrence\nfor the system which destroyed him and his people.  Purvis said that he\ncould welcome the overthrow of this government and he could hope that it\nwould be replaced by a better one.\n\nThe alienation of the Afro-American from his government was dramatically\nunderscored and justified in 1857 by the Dred Scott Decision which was\nhanded down by the Supreme Court. A slave who had resided with his master\nin a territory where slavery was forbidden by act of Congress had claimed\nhis freedom. After returning to slave territory, he sued his master on\nthe grounds that residence in a non-slave territory had made him free.\nThe court said that the Missouri Compromise which had established\nslave-free territories was unconstitutional, and it went on to state that\nblacks were not citizens of the United States and therefore could not\nbring a suit in court. In one single decision the court had lashed out at\nthe Afro-American with two blows.  Besides justifying slavery, it had\nopenly supported the spread of the peculiar institution into the West.\nThen, it castrated the freedmen by denying any political rights to them.\nThey were left with four alternatives: slavery, a freedom rooted in\npoverty and prejudice, emigration abroad, or revolution.\n\nSuddenly, the terms of the equation were dramatically altered by an\nobscure white man named John Brown. After beginning his public career in\nNew England as a participant in the abolitionist struggle, Brown became\nabsolutely outraged by the apparent success that the South was having in\nspreading slavery into the new territories. He became one of the most\nactive leaders in Kansas and rallied support to prevent that state from\nfalling into the hands of proslavery factions. The slavery debates in\nKansas exploded into open combat. Brown's outrage became a fiery\nconviction that God had chosen him to be one of the leaders in the\nrighteous struggle against slavery. He also came to believe that, if God\nhad justified violence in defending righteousness in the Old Testament,\nit could be used in other places and on a wider scale to topple the\npeculiar institution.\n\nBrown spent several weeks in Rochester, New York, at the home of\nFrederick Douglass, planning what amounted to a guerrilla campaign\nagainst the South. Despite Brown's urging, Douglass refused to join in\nwhat he believed to be a futile and desperate gesture. However, he wished\nBrown the best of luck. The plan was to establish a center of operation\nin the Virginia hills. Brown did not expect to defeat the South by force\nof arms. Instead, he believed that he could establish a mountain refuge\nwhich would attract ever-increasing numbers of slaves.  His hope was that\nthe drain on the slave system, coupled with the masters' fear of attack,\nwould so strain the peculiar institution that, bit by bit, the South\nwould be forced to negotiate some kind of settlement.\n\nHowever, Brown had to obtain arms and ammunition, and, to keep the\noperation going he and his men needed food and other supplies. The result\nwas the raid on the government arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. The\nattacking party included five blacks: Lewis Sheridan Leary, Dangerfield\nNewly, John Anthony Copeland, Osborn Perry Anderson, and Shields Green.\nTwo of them were killed in the attack, two more were later executed, and\none escaped. The attack failed, and Brown and several others were\nexecuted. Before his execution Brown said that, while they might dispose\nof him quite easily, the Negro question itself could not be easily\ndismissed. His prediction proved correct, Brown's execution made him a\nmartyr and at the end led to the victory for which he had yearned.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nFrom Slavery to Segregation\n\n\nBlue, Gray, and Black\n\nJohn Brown's raid convinced the South that Northern harassment of slavery\nwould continue and that the tactics would become even more desperate. At\nthe same time, the election of Abraham Lincoln was interpreted by the\nSouth as a swing of the political pendulum in favor of the abolitionists.\nThis was not true. Both Lincoln and the Republican Party had decided that\nthe Anti-slave issue was not a broad enough platform on which to win an\nelection. While Lincoln had made it clear that he himself opposed\nslavery, he also insisted that his political position, as well as that of\nthe party, was to oppose the extension of slavery rather than to abolish\nit.\n\nAlthough he emphasized different beliefs in varying localities, he still\nmaintained that, while he opposed the enslavement of human beings, he did\nnot view Africans as equals. He was convinced that there was a wide\nsocial gap between whites and blacks, and he indicated that he had grave\ndoubts about extending equal political rights to Afro-Americans. Besides\nopposing slavery, he believed that racial differences pointed to the\nnecessity for the separation of the two races, and he favored a policy of\nemigration. However, he had no interest in forcing either abolition or\nemigration on anyone.  His political goals were to increase national\nunity, to suppress the extension of slavery, to encourage voluntary\nemancipation, and to stimulate volitional emigration. He was far from the\nabolitionist which the South believed him to be. At the same time,\nabolitionists were as unhappy with his election as were slaveholders. His\nelection was clearly an attempt to strike a compromise, but the South was\nin no mood to negotiate. It was not willing to permit the restriction of\nslavery to the states in which   the system already existed, and the\nSouthern states seceded.\n\nOnce the Civil War began, Lincoln's primary goal was to maintain\nor reestablish the union of all the states. His strategy was to negotiate\nfrom a platform which provided the largest numbers of supporters. With\nthese priorities in the foreground, the government took considerable time\nto clarify its position on emancipation as well as its stand regarding\nthe use of freedmen in the Union forces. Lincoln suspected that he would\nnot get the kind of solid and enthusiastic support from the Northern\nstates which he needed if he did not work towards eventual emancipation.\nAt the same time, if he took too strong a position in favor of\nemancipation he feared that the border states would abandon the Union and\nside with the South. Similarly, the refusal to use blacks in the Union\nforces might seriously weaken the military cause. Yet, their use might\nalienate the border states, and it might be so repugnant to the South as\nto hinder future negotiations.\n\nEarly in the war the North was faced with the problem of what to do with\nthe slaves who fled from the South into the Union lines for safety. In\nthe absence of any uniform policy, individual officers made their own\ndecisions. According to the Fugitive Slave Act, Northern officials should\nhave helped in capturing and returning them. When General Butler learned\nthat the South was using slaves to erect military defenses, he declared\nthat such slaves were contraband of war and therefore did not have to be\nreturned.  Congress stated that it was not the duty of an officer to\nreturn freed slaves. However, on at least one occasion, Lincoln gave\ninstructions to permit masters to cross the Potomac into Union lines to\nlook for their runaway slaves.\n\nIn August, 1861, a uniform policy was initiated with the passing of the\nConfiscation Act. It stated that property used in aiding the insurrection\ncould be captured. When such property consisted of slaves, it stated that\nthose slaves were to be forever free. Thereafter, slaves flocked into\nUnion lines in an ever-swelling flood. Besides fighting the war, the\nUnion army found itself bogged down caring for thousands of escaped\nslaves, a task for which it was unprepared. In some cases confiscated\nplantations were leased to Northern whites, and escaped slaves were hired\nout to work them.  In December of 1862 General Saxton declared that\nabandoned land could be used for the benefit of the ex-slave. Each family\nwas given two acres of land for every worker in the family, and the\ngovernment provided some tools with which to work it. However, most of\nthe land was sold to Northern capitalists who became absentee landlords\nwith little or no interest in maintaining the quality of the land or in\ncaring for the ex-slave who did the actual labor. These ex-slaves were\nherded into large camps with very poor facilities. The mortality rate ran\nas high as 25 percent within a two-year period.\n\nGradually, a very large number of philanthropic relief associations, many\nof which were related to the churches, sprang up to help the ex-slave by\nproviding food, clothing, and education. Thousands of school teachers,\nboth black and white, flocked into the South to help prepare the ex-slave\nfor his new life.\n\nIn the beginning, Lincoln had been very reticent in permitting the use of\nslaves or freedmen in the army.  As early as 1861 General Sherman had\nauthorized the employment of fugitive slaves in \"services for which they\nwere suited.\" Late in 1862 Lincoln permitted the enlistment of some\nfreedmen, and, in 1863, their enlistment became widespread. By the end of\nthe war more than 186,000 of them had joined the Union forces.  For the\nfirst time in American history, however, they were forced to serve in\nsegregated units and were usually commanded by white officers.  One of\nthe ironies of the conflict was that the war which terminated slavery was\nalso responsible for initiating segregation within the armed Forces. In a\nway this fact became symbolic of the role which racial discrimination and\nsegregation eventually came to play in American society. Besides fighting\nin segregated units, the Negro soldiers, for about a year, received half\npay. The 54th Massachusetts regiment served for an entire year without\nany pay rather than to accept discriminatory wages.  In South Carolina a\ngroup of soldiers stacked their arms in front of their captain's tent in\nprotest against the prejudicial pay scale. Sgt. William Walker, one of\nthe instigators of the demonstration, was court-martialed and shot for\nthis action.  Finally, in 1864 all soldiers received equal pay.\n\nThe South was outraged by the use of \"colored troops.\" It refused to\nrecognize them and treat them as enemy soldiers, and, whenever any were\ncaptured, it preferred to treat them as runaway slaves under the black\ncodes. This meant that they received much harsher treatment than they\nwould have if they had been treated as prisoners of war. Also, the South\npreferred to kill them instead of permitting their surrender. As a result\nmore than 38,000 of them were killed during the war.\n\nMany Northerners were also upset by the use of \"colored troops.\" They did\nnot like to have the Civil War considered a war to abolish slavery.  Many\nof them feared that this would only increase competition. As a result,\nwhen white longshoremen struck in New York and blacks were brought in to\ntake their place, a riot ensued.  Many of the white strikers found\nthemselves drafted into the Army, and they did not appreciate fighting to\nsecure the freedom of men who took away their jobs.  Even during the war\nracial emotions continued to run high in the North.\n\nIn 1862 General Hunter proclaimed the freedom of all slaves in the\nmilitary sector: Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. When Lincoln heard\nof it, he immediately reversed the decree. He preferred gradual,\ncompensated emancipation followed by voluntary emancipation. He persuaded\nCongress to pass a bill promising Federal aid to any state which set\nforth a policy of gradual compensated emancipation.  Abolitionists said\nthat masters should not be paid for freeing their slaves because slaves\nwere never legitimate property. Congress also established a fund to aid\nvoluntary emigration to either Africa or Latin America. However, few\nslaves were interested even in compensated emancipation, and the plan\nreceived almost no support. Lincoln finally concluded  that emancipation\nhad become a military necessity. In September 1862 he issued a\npreliminary decree promising to free all slaves in rebel territory. On\nJanuary 1, 1863, the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect.\nHowever, slavery continued to be legal in a areas which were not in\nrebellion. Final abolition of the institution came with the passage of\nthe Thirteenth Amendment after the end of hostilities.\n\nBy the end of the war the South became so desperate that the use of\nslaves in the Army was sanctioned, and they were promised freedom at the\nend of the conflict.  As the end of the war, some questions had been\nsolved and new ones had been created. Lincoln's belief in the fact that\nthe Union was indissoluble had been vindicated, and it was also evident\nthat national unity could not go hand in hand with sectional slavery.\nBut three new questions were now emerging. How should sectional strife be\nhealed? What should be the status of the ex-slave?  Who should determine\nthat status?\n\n\nReconstruction and Its Failure\n\nAt the close of the war more attention was given to the reconstruction of\nSouthern institutions than to the elevation of the ex-slave. While a\nhandful of the Radical Republicans, such as Sumner and Stevens, were\naware that slavery had not prepared the ex-slave for participation in a\nfree competitive society, most liberals assumed that the termination of\nslavery meant the end of their problems. They believed that blacks could\nimmediately enter into community life on an equal footing with other\ncitizens, Any suggestion that the ex-slave needed help to get started\ndrew considerable resentment and hostility from liberals and\nconservatives alike. With the abolition of the peculiar institution, the\nanti-slavery societies considered their work finished. Frederick\nDouglass, however, complained that the slaves were sent out into the\nworld empty-handed.  In fact, both the war and emancipation had\nintensified racial hostility. The ex-slave had not yet been granted his\ncivil rights. At the same time, he was no longer covered by property\nrights. Therefore he was even more vulnerable to physical intimidation\nthan before.\n\nAs the war drew to an end, Lincoln initiated a program aimed at the rapid\nreconstruction of the South and the healing of sectional bitterness. With\nonly the exclusion of a few Confederate officials, he offered immediate\npardon to all who would swear allegiance to the Federal Government. As\nsoon as ten percent of the citizens of any state who had voted in 1860\nhad taken this oath, a state could then hold local elections and resume\nhome rule. Since almost no blacks had voted in the Southern states in\n1860, his plan did nothing to encourage extending the franchise to them.\nHowever, he did believe that educated blacks could and should be given\nthe right to vote, but this extension of the franchise was apparently to\nbe determined by each state at some future time.\n\nAfter Lincoln's assassination, Andrew Johnson further accelerated the\npace of reconciliation. Granting personal pardons by the thousands, he\ninitiated a plan for restoration which was even more lenient. Southern\nstates resumed home rule, and, in the Federal election of 1866, they\nelected scores of Confederate officials to Congress. At the same time\nother Confederate officials were elected to other local posts throughout\nthe South.  One of the most urgent tasks taken up by these new home-rule\ngovernments was the determination and definition of the status of the\nex-slave. State after state passed black codes which bore an amazing\nresemblance to those of slavery days. Blacks were not allowed to testify\nin court against whites. If they quit their jobs, they could be\nimprisoned for breach of contract. Anyone found without a job could be\narrested and fined $50. Those who could not pay the fine were hired out\nto anyone in the community who would pay the fine. This created a new\nsystem of forced labor. At the same time, blacks could be fined for\ninsulting gestures, breaking the curfew, and for possessing firearms.\nThis created the kind of supervision of personal life which was similar\nto that of slavery. Although the Thirteenth Amendment had made slavery\nunconstitutional, the South was trying to recreate the peculiar\ninstitution in law while not admitting it in name.\n\nRadical Republicans in Congress were outraged both at the unrepentant\nobstinacy of the South and at the leniency of Johnson's plan for\nrestoration. After refusing to seat many of the Southern delegates to\nCongress the Radical Republicans went on to pass civil rights legislation\nwhich was aimed at protecting the ex-slave from the black codes.\nPresident Johnson, however vetoed these bills as well as the Fourteenth\nAmendment. An enraged Congress passed the civil rights legislation over\nhis veto and came within one vote of impeaching the President.  Although\nimpeachment failed, Johnson lost his leadership in the government, and\nCongress, within two years after the end of the war, began Reconstruction\nall over again. The first large-scale Congressional hearings in American\nhistory were held to investigate the conditions in the South. The\ninvestigation documented widespread poverty, physical brutality, and\nintimidation as well as legal discrimination. The comittee made a\ndetailed examination of the race riots which had occurred in Memphis and\nNew Orleans in which scores of blacks had been killed. It concluded that\nthe New Orleans riot was in fact a police massacre in which dozens of\nblacks were murdered in cold blood.\n\nCongress removed home rule from the Southern states and divided the area\ninto five military districts. Even those Southerners who had already\nreceived federal pardons were now required to swear a stricter oath in\norder to regain their right to vote. State conventions met to draft new\nconstitutions. These conventions were dominated by a coalition of three\ngroups: new black voters, whites who had come from the North either to\nmake personal fortunes or to help educate the ex-slave, and Southern\nwhites who had never supported the Confederacy.  The oath of allegiance\nrequired a citizen to swear that he was now and always had been loyal to\nthe Federal Government. This excluded all the Confederate officials.\nThese new Southern reconstruction governments operated under the\nprotection of the Army and with the encouragement of the Federal\nGovernment. They strove to reconstruct the South economically,\npolitically, and socially.\n\nThey established a system of public education, built many new hospitals,\nfounded institutions for the mentally and physically handicapped, and\nattempted to reform the penal system.  During Reconstruction blacks\nplayed a significant political role throughout the South. Besides voting\nin large numbers, they were elected to local, state, and federal offices.\nBetween 1869 and 1901, two became U. S.  Senators and twenty were members\nof the House of Representatives.  Senators Revels and Bruce were elected\nfrom Mississippi. P. B. S.  Pinchback was elected to the Senate from\nLouisiana, but he was not permitted to take his seat.  He did serve as\nLieutenant Governor of Louisiana, and, for three days, was Acting\nGovernor.\n\nWhite conservatives in the South were outraged, and they were determined\nto have absolutely nothing to do with a government which permitted Negro\nparticipation.  They spread the myth that Reconstruction governments were\nin the grip of intolerably stupid and corrupt black men. Although Negroes\nwere elected to state governments in significant numbers, the fact was\nthat at no time were they in control. Moreover, when the critics\nthemselves came to power, they did nothing to undo the work of the\nReconstruction governments. This fact cast doubts on the sincerity of\ntheir criticism. The one thing which the white conservatives did when\nthey regained power was to disenfranchise the blacks. This indicated that\ntheir real complaint in regard to Reconstruction was the participation of\nNegroes in government.  With the Federal Government protecting the civil\nand political rights of the ex-slave, the South was unable to use the law\nto keep him in his place. The passionate belief in white superiority and\na desperate fear of black retaliation caused many whites to resort to\nphysical intimidation to achieve their purposes. The Ku Klux Klan was the\nmost notorious of a large number of similar organizations which spread\nthroughout the South. Negroes and white sympathizers were beaten and\nlynched. Some had their property burned, and others lost their jobs if\nthey showed too much independence.\n\nIn 1869 Congress took action against the Klan and other white supremacy\norganizations, The Klan was officially disbanded, but, in fact, it only\nwent underground. Most of these organizations were spontaneous local\ndevelopments, and this made it difficult for either federal or state\ngovernments to find and destroy them.  Often their tactics were\nsuccessful in shaping election results.  Their propaganda was also useful\nin influencing public opinion.  They insisted that they were only\nprotecting women, children, and civic morality.  The federal military\nforces stationed in the South were too small to be effective against such\nwidespread guerrilla activities, and many of the soldiers, though they\nhad fought against slavery, were still in sympathy with white supremacy.\n\nAlthough Reconstruction did protect some of the political and civil\nrights of the Afro-American community, it achieved almost nothing in\nimproving the social and economic situation. The concept of social and\neconomic rights was almost nonexistent a century ago. Political rights,\nhowever, without economic security could be a mere abstraction.\nMeaningful freedom had to be more than the freedom to starve. This meant\nthat the ex-slave needed land, tools, and training to provide him with an\neconomic base that would make his freedom real. The ex-slave had limited\neducation, limited experience, a servile slave attitude, and he was in\nneed of social and economic training to compensate for the years of\nslavery. Without this he could not enter a competitive society as an\nequal. Emancipation was not enough.\n\nMost slaves had been engaged in plantation agriculture and were destined\nto continue in some kind of farm work. Sumner and Stevens led the fight\nin Congress to provide each of them with forty acres and a mule, and this\nwould have provided the basis for their developing into an independent\nclass of farmers.  However, they were doomed to remain a subservient mass\nof peasants. The prewar slave plantation was replaced by sharecropping,\ntenant farming, and the convict lease system. In some cases the ex-slave\nwas provided with land, tools, and seed by plantation owner who, in turn,\nwas to get a share of the crop at the end of the season. His share was\nalways so large that the cropper remained permanently in his debt.\nSimilarly, tenant farmers paid rent for their land and were extended\nloans by the store keeper for their provisions. Interest rates ran so\nhigh that they too remained in permanent bondage. Finally, some\nplantation owners leased convicts from the state and worked them in chain\ngangs which most closely resembled the prewar slave system.  In every\ncase, the result was that black farm laborers remained members of a\npermanent peasant class.\n\nThe other hope for the advancement of the ex-slave was through the\ndevelopment of industrial skills. At this time the American labor\nmovement was emerging and was striving to protect and elevate the status\nof industrial workers. If the ex-slave had been integrated into this\nmovement, it would have helped many of them to achieve economic security.\nAt the same time, it would have strengthened the labor movement itself.\nHowever, white workers usually saw blacks as job competitors rather than\nas part of a mass labor alliance. In 1866 the National Labor Union\ndecided to organize black workers within its ranks, but by 1869 it was\nurging colored delegates to its convention to form their own separate\norganization. This resulted in the creation of the National Negro Labor\nConvention. This split between black and white workers tended to push\nblacks into political action while whites put all their efforts into\neconomic advancement.\n\nThe Knights of Labor was formed in 1869, and it did seriously try to\norganize blacks and whites. In the North it operated mixed locals, and in\nthe South it had separate black and white organizations. It employed both\nblack and white organizers. In 1886 its total membership was estimated at\n700,000  of which 60,000 were black. The following year its total\nmembership had shrunk to 500,000, but its black membership had increased\nto 90,000. The early labor movement which strove to organize the mass of\nindustrial workers was soon replaced by skilled trade unions which aimed\nat the organization of a labor elite.\n\nAlthough the American Federation of Labor did not profess racial\ndiscrimination as a deliberate national policy, many of its individual\ntrade unions did, and, because of its federated structure, the A. F. of\nL. had no power over local discriminatory practices. Whites in skilled\ntrades used unions to maintain an exclusive control in those trades, and\nthey deliberately strove to relegate blacks to the lower ranks of\nindustrial labor. Barred from the road to advancement, black labor became\na permanent industrial proletariat.\n\nThe Freedmen's Bureau was the one federal attempt to raise the social and\neconomic standing of the ex-slave. Along with the American Missionary\nAssociation, the Freedmen's Bureau did significant work in education.\nHundreds of teachers staffed scores of schools and brought some degree of\nliteracy and job skills to thousands of pupils. However, beyond the field\nof education, the bureau did little except to provide temporary help.\nBegun as a war measure, when the Radical Republicans came into control,\nthey put it on a more permanent footing. Even liberals, however, were not\nprepared to support a long-term social experiment, and, after some half\ndozen years, the Bureau was terminated. This left the Afro-American\ncommunity without the economic base necessary for competing in American\nsociety on an equal basis.\n\nThe one achievement of Reconstruction had been to guarantee minimum of\npolitical and civil rights to the ex-slave, but white supremacy advocates\nwere adamant in their intention to destroy this advance.  Where terror\nand intimidation were not successful, relentless economic pressure by\nlandowners, merchants, and industrialists brought most of the ex-slaves\ninto line. Year by year they exerted less influence at the voting booths.\nAlthough the country was aware of this, Northern liberals were growing\nweary of the unending fight to protect the freedman.  Furthermore, masses\nof Northern whites sympathized with Southern race prejudice. While they\ndid approve of ending slavery, they were not willing to extend social and\npolitical equality. The North had begun to put a higher priority on peace\nthan on justice. Industrialists were expanding their businesses rapidly,\nand they wanted the South to be pacified, so that it would be a safe area\nfor investment and expansion. If this meant returning power to white\nconservatives, they were willing to pay the price.  The presidential\nelection of 1876 degenerated into chaos and confusion. Samuel J. Tilden,\nthe Democratic candidate, and Rutherford B. Hayes, the Republican,\ndisputed its results.  Democrats and Republicans both claimed twenty\nelectoral votes from Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida. The\nfirst returns had shown that Tilden was the victor, but Republicans,\nespecially Army veterans, warned that they would not accept such a\nresult. The Republicans represented themselves as the party of the Union,\nand they claimed that the Democrats were the party of secession. The\ndebate grew so heated that it appeared war could erupt again. Pessimists\nwarned that it would be the last free election in American history. After\nmonths of bickering, a compromise was reached. The South was willing to\nsupport Republican Hayes if, when in power, he would remove the troops\nand restore home rule. The votes were counted again in the four states in\nquestion, and all twenty were awarded to Hayes allowing him to win by one\nelectoral vote.\n\nHayes began on an ambivalent note. On one hand he said that the country\nmust have honest and equal government, This would appear to be a\nconcession to the South which complained vehemently about the supposed\ncorruption of black Reconstruction. On the other hand, he admitted that\nthe rights of blacks must be protected by the Federal Government. In\npractice, however, by returning the South to home rule, he abandoned the\nex-slave. He said that the ex-slave's interest would be best protected by\nbeing left in the hands of honest and influential Southern whites. Hayes\nhad expressed an awareness of the brutality and intimidation which still\ncontinued in the South, but he had apparently concluded that federal\nintervention only aggravated the problem. In his opinion Southern\ngentlemen were not thieves and cut-throats; they too were educated,\ncivilized, and Christians. The fact that they were not aware of the\nbrutality in their midst and that some of them undoubtedly participated\nin it, bewildered him. He was willing to proceed on the assumption that,\nif the Southern whites were left alone, they would, as they asserted,\ntreat the ex-slave honestly and fairly. Hayes seemed unaware that men\ncould be educated, civilized, and claim to be Christians while at the\nsame time behaving as bigots and racists.  To satisfy the industrialists\nin the North and the white conservatives in the South, Hayes buried the\nlast remains of Reconstruction. However, he made a one-sided compromise.\nWhile he comitted himself to immediate action, the South was only bound\nby vague promises to be fulfilled at some indefinite date. At the end of\nhis term white supremacy in the South was more firmly rooted than it had\nbeen when he took office.\n\n\nThe New Racism\n\nFor several years the fate of the Southern Negro hung in the balance.\nWith home rule restored, the South, so it seemed, had achieved its goals.\nBourbon whites, the remnant of the plantation aristocracy, dominated the\nSouthern Democratic party and through it controlled state and local\ngovernments. There was a growing discontent among small farmers who\nwanted the state governments to alter the tax burden and interest rates\nin their favor. Largely spearheaded by the Populist movement, Negro and\nwhite farmers came to see that their interests were identical.  The\nSouthern Farmers' Alliance grew rapidly, and it encouraged the formation\nof the colored farmers' organizations with which it was closely allied.\nIn Georgia, Tom Watson led the attempt to form a coalition between Negro\nand white farmers against the interests of the conservative white\naristocracy. Hopes for a genuinely popular government and for a society\nfree from racial tension reached a high level.\n\nUnfortunately, some Negroes continued to back the Democratic party.\nHouse servants had always felt close to the gentry, and many of them\nremembered that poor white farmers had always been particularly\nprejudiced against them. In turn, conservatives deliberately encouraged\nracial hatred in order to drive a wedge between poor whites and Negroes\nwithin the rising Populist movement. It became evident to both Democrats\nand populists that the Negro vote had become the deciding vote in many\nstates. White farmers and white aristocrats both felt uneasy over this\nstate of affairs.\n\nThe result was widespread agreement to systematically and legally\neliminate Negroes from politics altogether. State constitutions were\neither amended or rewritten. Literacy tests and poll taxes became\nstandard devices for limiting Negro voting. The \"understanding test\"\nrequired a citizen to interpret a portion of the state constitution to\nthe satisfaction of the registrar. The severity of the test varied\ninvariably with the color of the applicant. The \"grandfather clause\"\nprohibited those whose ancestors had not voted from exercising the\nfranchise. Because slaves had not voted, their descendants were\ndisqualified.  Although the Fifteenth Amendment had been designed to\nguarantee the vote to the ex-slave, the South now evaded it. Although\nboth major parties complained about this disenfranchisement and condemned\nit as being unconstitutional, neither party took any action.  The Supreme\nCourt also played an important part in restricting the freedom of\nfreedmen. In 1883 it declared the 1875 Civil Rights Act to be\nunconstitutional. This act had made it illegal for individuals to\ndiscriminate in public accommodations.  Although it had never been\nenforced, the court's decision nevertheless, came as a setback, because\nit was the signal to the South that through Jim Crow legislation Negroes\ncould be kept in \"their place.\" Under slavery there had been considerable\nsocial contact between the races. Segregation as a social system was\nbegun in the North prior to the Civil War, but, during the last two\ndecades of the nineteenth century, Southern states made it a legal\nrequirement. Its relentless growth is carefully outlined by C.  Vann\nWoodward in his book The Strange Career of Jim Crow.  Finally the South\ndeveloped two societies with two sets of institutions: separate railroad\ncars, separate waiting rooms, separate wash rooms, separate drinking\nfountains, separate hospitals, separate schools, separate restaurants,\nseparate cemeteries and, although there was only one judicial system,\nseparate Bibles for taking oaths.\n\nIn 1896 the Supreme Court gave its blessing to the Jim Crow system.\nPlessy, a Louisiana mulatto, insisted on riding in the white car on the\ntrain. He was arrested and found guilty of violating the state statute.\nHe appealed to the U. S. Supreme Court, but it upheld his conviction by\nclaiming that \"separate but equal\" facilities were not a violation of his\nrights. Because the court did not define what it meant by equal and did\nnot insist on enforcing that equality in concrete terms, its decision\nwas, in fact, a blatant justification for separate and inferior\nfacilities for Negroes.\n\nSegregation was accompanied by a new wave of race hatred. White Americans\ncame to believe that all Negroes were alike and therefore could be\ntreated as a group. An identical stereotype of the Negro fixed itself on\nthe white mind throughout the entire country. If the Northerner hated\nthis stereotype somewhat  less than did the Southerner, it was only\nbecause the number of Negroes in the North was considerably smaller. At\nthe end of the century only two percent of the total number of\nAfro-Americans was to be found in the North. The great northern migration\nhad not yet begun.\n\nBoth the Northern press and the genteel literary magazines contained the\nsame vulgar image of the Negro which was to be found in openly racist\ncommunities in the South. Whether he appeared in news articles,\neditorials, cartoons, or works of fiction, he was universally portrayed\nas superstitious, stupid, lazy, happy-go-lucky, a liar, a thief, and a\ndrunkard. He loved fun, clothes, and trinkets as well as chickens,\nwatermelons, and sweet potatoes. Usually he was depicted as having been a\nfaithful and loving slave before Emancipation, but, unfortunately, he was\nunable to adjust to his new freedom  News stories and editorials referred\nto Negroes in slanderous terms without any apparent sense of\nembarrassment. Phrases like \"barbarian,\" \"Negro ruffian,\" \"African\nAnnie,\" \"colored cannibal,\" \"coon,\" and \"darkie\" were standard epithets.\nWhenever blacks were depicted in cartoons or photographs, the stereotype\npresented them as having thick lips, flat noses, big ears, big feet, and\nkinky woolly hair. News items concerning those involved in criminal\nactivities almost always identified them by color.  This contributed to\nthe development of the stereotype of the criminal Negro.\n\nThroughout its history, America had been predominantly an Anglo-Saxon and\nProtestant country. The Afro-American stood out in sharp distinction to\nthis picture both because of his color and his African heritage. By the\nend of the nineteenth century America was being flooded with immigrants\nfrom Southern and Eastern Europe. They too were much darker than the\ndominant strains of Northern Europe, and many were Catholics. There was a\ngrowing feeling that these new immigrants, like the Negroes, were\ninherently alien and intrinsically unassimilable.  Liberals in the\nprogressive movement, who were concerned about protecting the integrity\nand morality of American society, were in the fore-front of those who\nfeared the new hordes of \"swarthy\" immigrants.\n\nOne of those who feared that the large influx of South and East Europeans\nwould undermine the quality of American life was Madison Grant. In his\nbook The Passing of the Great Race, he warned that Nordic excellence\nwould be swamped by the faster-spawning Catholic immigrants.  Originally\nthese racial stereotypes had some cultural and historical basis, but they\nwere gaining a new strength and authority from the sociological and\nbiological sciences centering in the concepts of Social Darwinisn.\n\nDarwinism and related theories in anthropology and sociology helped to\ngive an aura of respectability to racism in both Europe and America.  The\nsame kind of pseudo-scientific thinking which was developed in Europe to\njustify anti-Semitism was used in America to reinforce prejudices against\nNegroes as well as against Jews and South Europeans.  In the first half\nof the nineteenth century the American anthropologist Samuel George\nMorton argued that each race had its own unique characteristics.  Racial\ncharacter, he believed, was the result of inheritance rather than of\nenvironment. Because these characteristics found specific environments\ncongenial, each race had gravitated to its preordained geographic habitat.\n\nDarwin's theory of evolution offered another explanation for the\nexistence of differing species in the animal kingdom, and anthropologists\nconcluded that it would also provide an explanation for racial\ndifferences in mankind. Early anthropologists and sociologists were\npreoccupied with dividing humanity into differing races and trying to\ncatalog and explain these differences. Phrenology was another\npseudo-science which attempted to construct a system according to which\nintellectual and moral characteristics would be correlated with the size\nand shape of the human head. On this basis many tried to divide mankind\ninto physical types and to assign to each its own intellectual and moral\nqualities.  Another one who believed that human races could be\nscientifically measured and that their superiority and inferiority could\nthus be established was Joseph A. de Gobineau, a French anthropologist.\nHerbert Spencer took Darwin's concept of the survival of the fittest and\nused it as a scientific justification for the competitive spirit, It\nbecame the basis of the explanation why some individuals moved up the\nsocial ladder while others remained behind.  Racial thinkers applied the\nconcept of human competitiveness to racial conflict instead of to\nindividual competition. In its usual form the Anglo-Saxon or Teutonic\nrace was depicted as superior, and the Semitic and Negroid races as\ninferior. Human history was explained as the history of race conflict,\nand racial hostility was justified because, through this conflict, the\nsuperior types would survive and human civilization would be elevated.\nThe concept of human equality was reduced to a meaningless abstraction,\nScholars like William Graham Sumner insisted that the founding fathers\nonly intended human equality to refer to their own kind of people.\n\nTo Thomas Nelson Page, in the North American Review, it appeared that the\nAfrican race had not progressed in human history. It had failed to\nprogress in America, not because it had been enslaved, but because it did\nnot have the faculty to raise itself above that status. He continued to\nargue that its inability to advance in the scale of civilization was\ndemonstrated by the level of social and political life to be found in\nLiberia, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Brazil. In the same journal,\nTheodore Roosevelt announced that the African was a member of \"a\nperfectly stupid race\" which was kept down by a lack of natural\ndevelopment.  Another one whose views became influential was Josiah\nStrong. A prominent clergyman at the turn of the century, he was of the\nopinion that the pressure of population expansion would eventually push\nthe whites, who had superior energy and talent, into Mexico, South and\nCentral America, the islands of the seas, and eventually into Africa\nitself. This expansion would lead to racial conflict which would\nculminate in the survival of the fittest through the victory of the white\nover the colored races of the world.  Strong's belief that white racial\nsuperiority would naturally lead to racial imperialism and world\ndomination by the white race was shared by many contemporary Americans. A\nfew of those who shared his ideas were Senator Albert Beveridge, Senator\nCabot Lodge, John Hay, Admiral Alfred T. Mahan, and Theodore Roosevelt.\nRacism opened the door to American imperialism.\n\nThe new racism could not depend on the existence of slavery in order to\nreinforce white superiority. Instead, it drew on racial stereotypes and\nflimsy scientific opinion. The conquest of Africa by Europe and the\nAmerican acquisition of lands in the Caribbean and Pacific which were\ninhabited by darker peoples, were taken as clear evidence of racial\ninequality even in the land which had been founded on the belief in the\nequality of all men.\n\nSecond-class citizenship for blacks had become a fact which was accepted\nby Presidents, Congress, the Supreme Court, the business community, and\nby labor unions. Segregation was universal. In the North it was rooted in\nsocial custom, but in the South it had been made a matter of law.\nSeparate facilities were inferior facilities.  The basic political and\ncivil rights of the Afro-American were severely limited in almost every\nstate.\n\nPerhaps the clearest and cruelest index of the lowest state to which the\nblack had been relegated was the large number of lynchings which occurred\nat the end of the century, In the 1890s lynchings of both blacks and\nwhites were common. In that decade one black was lynched almost every two\ndays. It became universally accepted that the American principles of\njustice, liberty, and equality did not have to be applied equally to\nwhites and blacks.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nRacism and Democracy\n\n\nFighting Jim Crow\n\nRAYFORD W. LOGAN, in his book The Betrayal of the Negro described the\nturn of the century as the low point in Afro-American history. After\nEmancipation, he contended, the hopes of the Negroes were betrayed.\nAgain they were pushed down into second-class status. It appeared that\ndemocracy was for whites only. Actually, the increasing growth of racism\nand of segregation as well, led inevitably to the development of\nopposition groups bent on destroying this discrimination. Segregation\npromoted the creation of Negro institutions which then became the center\nfor this counterattack.\n\nThe most prominent of these Afro-American institutions was the Negro\nchurch. Like the white church, it was fragmented into many separate\ndenominations. There was the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the\nAfrican Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, the Colored Methodist Episcopal\nChurch, the National Baptists, and a host of denominational organizations.\n\nHowever, integrated congregations within the mainly white church groups\nwere almost nonexistent. Those blacks who did belong to such white\ndenominations usually attended all-black congregations within the larger\ninstitutional structure. Negro colleges also sprang up throughout the\nSouth as well as an occasional one in the North. These included such\nwell-known schools as Howard, Hampton, Tuskegee, and Fisk. The churches\nand colleges became training grounds for a growing middle-class and for\nfuture community leaders. Each in its own way provided a debating center\nin which racial problems closing in from all sides were considered.\n\nAs Negroes were frequently denied employment by whites, they began to\ndevelop businesses of their own. Because their capital was almost always\nsmall, their task was made more difficult. White-owned banks hesitated to\nlend money to Negroes, forcing them into developing banks of their own.\nBy 1900 blacks had founded four banks which appealed mainly to a Negro\nclientele. They had a combined capital of more than $90,000.  White-owned\ninsurance companies often refused to sell insurance policies to Negroes.\nStandardized mortality charts showed that Negroes died at an earlier age\nthan whites. When insurance companies did accept them as clients, they\nwere charged higher rates than were whites. During the nineteenth\ncentury, various Negro secret societies attempted to develop insurance\nprograms for their members. In 1898 the National Benefit Insurance\nCompany was opened in Washington.  Owned by blacks, it deliberately\nsought out Negro patronage. In the same year, the Mutual Benefit\nInsurance Company was opened in North Carolina along similar lines.\n\nWhite undertakers and beauticians were reluctant to cater to Negro\ncustomers. Aside from their personal tastes,  they feared that it would\nalienate their white patrons. A similar situation held true for dentists\nand doctors. This forced the Afro-American community to develop its own\nprofessionals. By 1900, Negroes had invested half a million dollars in\nundertaking establishments.  That same year, the Afro-American community\nhad produced 1,700 physicians, 212 dentists, 728 lawyers, 310\njournalists, an several thousand college, secondary, and elementary\nschool teachers.\n\nOther Negro professionals, finding themselves excluded from existing\nofficial affiliations formed their own professional fraternity in 1904.\nTwo years later, the first Greek letter society for Negroes was\nestablished to help its members in coping with the effects of social\ndiscrimination on largely white college campuses. In 1915, Carter G.\nWoodson established the Association for the Study of Negro Life and\nHistory and began publication of the Journal of Negro History.\n\nIn 1905, W. E. B. DuBois, John Hope, Monroe Trotter, Kelly Miller, and\nother outspoken young Negro intellectuals met in Niagara Falls, Ontario,\nand founded the \"Niagara Movement.\" Unlike the other black institutions\nmentioned above, the \"Niagara Movement\" was primarily political in its\nobjectives. On the one hand, it strove to seize the leadership of the\nAfro-American community, taking it away from the more conciliatory\nemphasis of  Booker T. Washington.  On the other hand, they wanted a\nplatform from which to condemn, loudly and clearly, the white prejudice\nthey found all about them.\n\nThe organization deliberately tried to resurrect the spirit of the angry\nabolitionists immediately preceding the Civil War. The meeting places of\ntheir three conventions were chosen for their symbolic value.  Niagara\nFalls was the terminal on the underground railway, the point at which\nrunaways had reached freedom.  Harpers Ferry had been the site of John\nBrown's violent assault on slavery, and Oberlin, Ohio, had been well\nknown as a center of abolitionist activity.\n\nThe growth of racism at the turn of the century, besides encouraging the\ndevelopment of Negro institutions, revived the interests of some whites\nin fighting for racial justice. Whites were particularly upset by\nracially motivated acts of violence.  Lynchings reached a high point in\nAmerican history at this time.  Between 1900 and 1910, there were 846\nlynchings, in which 92 victims were white and 754 Negro.  Northern whites\nwere especially perturbed as racial violence began to move into the\nNorth. Previously they had viewed it as a Southern white man's problem.\nWhen a vicious race riot occurred in Springfield, Illinois, in 1908, this\nillusion was shattered. William English Walling, the journalist, was\nshocked and wrote an impassioned article, \"Race War in the North,\" which\nwas published in The Independent.\n\nWalling's article, which was based on his visit to Springfield, brought\nseveral collaborators to his side. In it, he contended that Southern\nracists were bringing the race war into the North and that the only\nalternative was to revive the spirit of abolitionism and to fight for\nracial equality. The following year a group of concerned individuals,\nblack and white, met in New York City and their meeting resulted in the\nformation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored\nPeople.  Those attending this meeting, besides Walling, included Oswald\nGarrison Villard, the grandson of William Lloyd Garrison.  Jane Addams,\nthe founder of Hull House in Chicago, John Dewey, the philosopher,\nWilliam Dean Howells, the editor of Harper's magazine, Mary White\nOvington, a New York social worker, and Dr. Henry Moskowitz. The Negro\ndelegation consisted of W. E. B.  DuBois and most of the other members of\nthe Niagara Movement. At this meeting it was decided that the achievement\nof racial equality must be the major target of their attack. In order to\nachieve this goal it was decided that their immediate priorities should\ninclude the enfranchisement of Negroes and the enforcement of the\nThirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments. The members also insisted that it\nwas time to launch a concerted attack against lynching and other kinds of\nmob violence.\n\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was\nofficially established in 1910 with Moorefield Storey as its president.\nW. E. B. DuBois was the only black on its board and served as its\ndirector of publicity and research. Most blacks and whites at the time\nbelieved that the N.A.A.C.P. was irresponsible for including so many of\nthe members of the Niagara Movement in its membership. Monroe Trotter and\na few others, however, held that an interracial organization such as the\nN.A.A.C.P. could not be trusted to take a strong enough stand on\nimportant issues, and they refused to cooperate with it. The N.A.A.C.P.\nbegan publication of its own Journal, Crisis, which was a basic part of\nits informational program. Crisis was edited by W. E. B. DuBois.\n\nThe most important work of the Association was done by its legal\ndepartment. Its lawyers attacked the legal devices used by some states to\ndisenfranchise Negroes. In 1915, the Supreme Court declared, in Guinn v.\nUnited States, that the \"grandfather clause\" in the constitutions of both\nMaryland and Oklahoma was null and void because it contradicted the\nFifteenth Amendment.  Two years later, in Buchanan v. Warley, the court\nsaid that Louisville's ordinance requiring Negroes to live in specified\nsections of the city was unconstitutional. In 1923, the N.A.A.C.P. came\nto the defense of a Negro who, it believed, had not received a fair\ntrial. In Moore v. Dempsey, the Supreme Court granted the defendant a new\ntrial because the court which had convicted him of murder had exempted\nNegroes from serving on its Jury.\n\nBranches of the N.A.A.C.P. spread all across the country. By 1921 there\nwere more than 400 separate chapters, and the Association was still\ngrowing. Its membership, whether white or black, tended to be\nmiddle-class and educated. In this respect it bore a marked similarity to\nthe National Urban League which came into existence at about the same\ntime.\n\nThe National Urban League grew out of a concern for the employment\nproblems of Negroes in New York City. George Edmund Haynes, a Negro\ngraduate student at Columbia University, was researching the economic\nconditions of New York City Negroes. He was invited to present his\nfindings to a Joint meeting of two city organizations which were probing\nthe same problem. The Comittee for Improving Industrial Conditions of\nNegroes in New York as well as the National League for the Protection of\nColored Women had been formed early in the century and were eager to base\ntheir efforts on scientific study rather than on mere sentimentality.\nHaynes's research was later published as The Negro at Work in New York\nCity.\n\nThis meeting resulted in the establishing of the Urban League which has\nbeen concerned primarily with finding employment for Negroes and aiding\nthem in acquiring improved job skills. Haynes and Eugene Kinckle Jones\nwere its executive directors. One of its sponsors was Booker T.\nWashington, who was more sympathetic with its orientation than he had\nbeen with either the Niagara Movement or the N.A.A.C.P., both of which\nwere more political and aggressive. The philanthropist Julius Rosenwald\ngave the League substantial financial aid. The Urban League soon spread\ninto other major cities and gained increasing importance as ever-growing\nnumbers of Negroes migrated into Northern urban areas and needed\nassistance in making the adjustment. Negro churches and colleges, along\nwith interracial organizations, began to establish the foundation for the\nlong hard struggle for racial equality which lay ahead.\n\n\nMaking the World Safe for Democracy\n\nWhile Negroes and some whites were engaged in trying to put American\nideals into practice within the country, others were reaching out to\nspread American democracy to more \"underprivileged\" peoples. American\nsociety had always contained a missionary dynamic. The Puritan Fathers\ncame to America to escape religious oppression and to establish what they\nbelieved would be the Kingdom of God. While it appeared that all they\nwanted was space in which to be left alone, their conviction that they\nwere building God's Kingdom implied a belief that their new society would\nprosper and spread. If it were really the Kingdom of God, it could not be\nexpected to remain an insignificant settlement on a distant and\nunimportant continent. For the next two hundred years, this missionary\ndynamic was absorbed in spreading across the North American continent.\nWhile the Americans did not see their expansion into the West as being\nimperialistic, American Indians saw it otherwise.\n\nWith the disappearance of the Western frontier, missionary-minded\nAmericans felt compelled to carry the benefits of their civilization to\nbackward areas of the world. At the same time, European imperialism was\ngaining new vitality. Businessmen were looking for new markets and for\nnew sources of raw materials. Patriots, in their turn, believed that they\nwere being called upon to assume the \"white man's burden\" and to civilize\nand democratize the world. Both drives seemed to coincide. The Berlin\nConference in 1885 divided those parts of Africa not yet annexed among\nthe major European nations. The point of the conference was to plan\nnational exploits in such a way as to reduce conflicts.  In the course of\na very few years, the rest of Africa was colonized by these nations.\nAfricans, of course, were given no voice in the matter.  China, though it\nwas not colonized, was also divided into spheres of economic influence.\nThe United States was quick to join in this scramble. Its influence,\nhowever, was limited largely to Asia and Latin America.\n\nThis new imperialist expansion was not interpreted by its proponents as\nbeing exploitative. Instead, they depicted it as bringing the blessing of\ncivilization to the \"underprivileged.\" The concept of the \"white man's\nburden\" was particularly common in Britain and America. The prevailing\nidea was that the white race, especially the Anglo-Saxon and Teutonic\nbranches of it, had been especially blessed by God so that it could\nachieve industrialization and democratization. It further taught that it\nwas their obligation to carry the benefits to less fortunate peoples.\n\nThis new imperialism hid its domination behind paternalism, but it still\npresented the imperialists as superiors and the colonials as inferiors.\nMoreover, because in most cases the imperialists were white and the\ncolonials colored, it meant that this imperialist drive also carried\nracial connotations. The American version of the \"white man's burden\" was\nmost blatantly presented by Josiah Strong in his book Our Country.\nAccording to Strong, the superior Anglo-Saxon race in America would\nmultiply rapidly, become powerful and prosperous, and then would spread\nthe blessings of industrialization and democracy south into Mexico and\ninto the Caribbean Islands. At the same time, American commercial\ninterests were searching for new markets and were making increasing\ninvestments in these very areas. The merchants were looking for new\nmarkets to exploit, but the idealist rhetoric talked only in terms of\nbenevolent paternalism.\n\nThese trends came to a head in the Spanish-American War.  Conflicts had\nbeen increasing in Cuba between the Spanish authorities in control and\nthe local citizens. Americans became interested in several abortive\nuprisings which occurred on the island. The brutal way in which the\nSpanish had suppressed them incensed the Americans. The violence in Cuba\nalso endangered American life and property--the result of increasing\nAmerican investments. The public favored intervention, proposing that\ntheir Caribbean neighbors should also share in the benefits of democracy.\nThey viewed the Spaniards as an antidemocratic element from the Old World\nblocking the road to progress in the western hemisphere.\n\nThe battleship Maine was sent to the Havana harbor ostensibly on a\ncourtesy visit. Its real object was to protect American interests. It was\nmysteriously blown up, and many of its crew were killed. The cause of the\nexplosion is still unknown.  American chauvinists chose to believe that\nthe ship had been deliberately destroyed, and they demanded retaliation.\nBefore long, American troops were sent to \"liberate\" the Cubans from\nSpanish oppression.\n\nAlthough the number of Negro troops who participated in the\nSpanish-American War was small, they fought heroically and contributed\nsignificantly to the American victory. The Negro participants served in\nsegregated units. These included the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the 24th\nand 25th Infantry units. In the battle of San Juan Hill, the Negro\ncavalry opened the way for the Rough Riders' famous charge which was led\nby Theodore Roosevelt.  Later in the day, the 24th Infantry came up from\nthe rear to support the action.\n\nAt the end of the war, Spain gave the United States sovereignty over\nPuerto Rico and, for the payment of a sum of money, the U.S.  also gained\nthe Philippines. Spain gave up her sovereignty over Cuba, but its future\nstatus was not made clear. American public opinion had become so wed to\nthe cause of democracy in Cuba that the American government felt it could\nnot take direct control of the island. It was deemed necessary to\nestablish a Cuban Republic, but it was obvious that America would\nexercise considerable influence over it. Early in the century the Platt\nAmendment was passed by the U. S. Congress, and Cuba was required to\ninclude it within her own constitution. This gave the United States\nauthority to intervene in Cuban affairs in order to maintain law and\norder. The U. S. also obtained Guantanamo Bay as a naval base in Cuba.\n\nIn 1916 American marines landed in Santo Domingo to restore law and order\nthere in the wake of a series of local uprisings.  Again, Americans\nwanted to protect their business interests in the island. The American\npresence, however, only contributed to the total collapse of civil\ngovernment, and the marines were not withdrawn until 1924.  American\ncommercial influence continued and grew even after the soldiers left.\nSimilarly, America intervened in the internal affairs of Haiti. It began\nwith the assumption of financial control of the Haitian government to\nhelp it achieve stability and, at the same time, to secure American\ninvestments. In an attempt to maintain law and order, American\nintervention spread to include taking control of the country's police\nforce. In 1917, the U. S. established military rule in Haiti and this was\nnot appreciated by the local citizens.  The marines were compelled to\nshoot some two thousand Haitians in the process of restoring peace. The\ntroops were not finally withdrawn from Haiti until 1934.\n\nIn spreading the benefits of her civilization into the Caribbean, America\nacquired a colored empire which only served to complicate her own racial\nsituation. Blacks, however, played an important role in the acquisition\nof this territory. American ministers to Haiti were usually Negroes, and\nNegro soldiers played a significant part in the Spanish-American War. In\ntheir attempts to demonstrate their loyalty and patriotism, American\nNegroes unwittingly helped to bring more colored peoples under the sway\nof American racism.\n\nAmerica's real involvement in world politics occurred with her entrance\ninto the First World War. The British and French had sought to give the\nwar an ideological flavor in order both to stir up the patriotism of\ntheir own citizens and also to draw in support from other nations,\nespecially the United States. The war was portrayed as a conflict between\ndemocracy and authoritarianism. When America joined the conflict,\nPresident Wilson emphasized even further this posture of idealism.\nAmericans viewed the war as the last war--the war which would make the\nworld \"safe for democracy.\"\n\nThe Afro-American community remained oblivious to the hostilities in\nEurope and was late in becoming aware of the imminence of war. Negroes\nwere preoccupied with the racial harassments confronting them at home and\nseldom looked beyond the country's borders. Once America became involved\nin the fighting, however, they were eager to demonstrate that they were\npatriotic and loyal citizens. Even W. E. B. DuBois, who was as hostile\nand angry as any, came to support the war effort. In an article which he\nwrote in Crisis, he called for his brothers to close ranks with the rest\nof American society and to present a solid front against the enemy. This\npatriotic solidarity came in spite of the fact that segregation was\ncreeping into the Federal Government itself.  President Taft, who had\ntried to broaden the base of the Republican Party in the South, had made\nsome feeble beginnings at instituting segregation in federal facilities\nin Washington.  In 1913, Wilson the first Southern Democratic president\nsince the Civil War, vastly expanded the process. The N.A.A.C.P.\nexpressed shock at Jim Crowism becoming an official part of the\ngovernment in the nation's capital. At the same time, the Civil Service\nrequired job applicants to file their photographs with their\napplications.  The N.A.A.C.P. charged that this was part of the spread of\ndiscriminatory practices in Washington, but the Civil Service denied it.\n\nWhen America declared war against Germany in April, 1917, only a few\nNegroes were members of the standing army. However, many immediately\nrushed to enlist, but only a few were accepted.  Local enlistment\nofficers were dubious about the ability and the loyalty of Negroes.\nApparently their previous service record had been forgotten, When\nCongress passed the Selective Service Act in May, it was made to apply to\nall citizens alike. During the course of the war, some 367,000 Negroes\nwere called into military service. This was 31 percent of those who had\nregistered.  Meanwhile, only 26 percent of the white registrants were\ncalled.  Once the Selective Service Act went into effect, discrimination\nhad the reverse effect from what it had produced before, Instead of\nkeeping Negroes out of the Army, some Selective Service Boards\ndiscriminated against them in terms of the exemptions which were\npermitted. Throughout the war, the Navy only accepted Negroes in menial\njobs, and the Marine Corps barred them altogether.\n\nTraining the Negro troops presented another problem. No community\nwelcomed an influx of hundreds or thousands of young Negro men.  The\nSouth, especially, was outraged when large numbers of \"cocky\" Negroes\nfrom the North descended upon some sleepy, peaceful town. Segregation and\ndiscrimination within the military itself caused further irritations and\ntriggered violence at more than one camp. The 92nd, an all-Negro outfit,\nwas trained at seven separate locations, and it was the only American\nunit never to come together before reaching the front. The 93rd, another\nall-Negro unit, was never consolidated. When it reached France, it served\nwith various units of the French Army. It had been sent overseas hastily,\nand its troops received most of their training in Europe. Its men had\nlargely been recruited from New York State, and they were sent to\nSpartanburg, South Carolina, for their training. The local citizens\ndeliberately picked a fight with the men in order to \"put them in their\nplace.\" A riot was narrowly averted.  When they were shipped back north\nfor training, they found themselves sharing a camp with white troops from\nthe South. Another incident almost occurred, and they were immediately\nsent overseas for training.\n\nBesides serving in segregated units, most of the Negro troops were\nassigned to menial tasks. One third of the American stevedore force in\nEurope was Negro. Nevertheless, many of them did become involved in the\nfighting and distinguished themselves heroically. Besides receiving\nAmerican awards, they were generously honored by the French. The 369th\nwas the first American unit to reach the Rhine, and the French praised it\nhighly.\n\nMany of the Negro soldiers were surprised by the hospitality which they\nreceived in France. Several stayed behind, after the war, to study in\nEuropean universities. In spite of the fact that many whites warned the\nFrench of dangers involved with associating with Negroes, especially\nwhite women with Negro men, the French were happy to have them share in\nthe defense. Many invited them into their homes. In the meantime, rumors\nspread in America that Negro troops were taking unwise liberties with\nFrench women. It was also said that the crime of rape was widespread.\nAmericans worried about what would happen when these men returned home.\nThe rumors were so insistent that, finally, the government sent Dr.\nMoton, the president of Tuskegee Institute, to Europe to investigate the\nsituation. He found that the rumors were totally unwarranted.\n\nWhen the victors met at Versailles to write the treaty which ended the\nwar, black people around the world, including Afro-Americans, hoped that\nthey would take up the problem of the African peoples as well. The only\nconsideration which was given to Africa, however, was the disposal of the\nGerman colonies.  These were distributed among the victors. This did\nnothing to give Africa back to the Africans; it only changed the identity\nof the European masters. W. E. B. DuBois, who was looking for a way to\nspotlight the problem of the African peoples, called a Pan-African\nCongress to meet in Paris simultaneously with the meeting in Versailles.\nFifty-seven delegates came, of which most were from Africa and America.\nWhile they had no authority and could do little of significance, the\nCongress did dramatize to the world the plight of the subject peoples of\nAfrica.\n\n\nUrban Riots\n\nIn spite of the fact that Negroes were fighting overseas to defend their\ncountry, racial tensions continued at home. In the years immediately\npreceding the war, racially motivated lynchings and riots, which had been\nlargely confined to the South, began to spread into the North and Midwest.\n\nIn Statesboro, Georgia, two blacks, who had been accused and convicted of\nmurder, were seized from the courtroom by an angry mob. After beating and\nburning them, the mob went on to loot and burn Negro-owned homes in the\ncommunity. In 1906, a white mob raged out of control for several days in\nAtlanta, Georgia. In the same year, the 25th Infantry in Brownsville,\nTexas, became involved in a riot with the white citizens of that town,\nand Roosevelt dismissed the whole battalion without honor. In 1904, a\nriot occurred in Springfield, Ohio, much farther north than anyone would\nhave expected. A Negro, who had been charged with killing a white police\nofficer, was seized from jail by an angry mob. After hanging him from a\ntelephone pole, the mob riddled his body with bullets, Then, they went on\nto destroy large sections of the Negro part of town.\n\nIn 1808 Springfield, Illinois, was the scene of the famous riot which\nhelped to motivate the founding of the N.A.A.C.P. There, a white woman\nclaimed to have been raped by a Negro. Although she admitted that she\nhad, in fact, been assaulted by a white man, the angry mob was only\nfurther enraged. It ran out of control for several days, and the state's\nmilitia was called in to restore order. Besides looting and burning, the\nmob boldly and deliberately lynched two of the city's responsible Negro\ncitizens. The leaders of the mob, as usual, went unpunished.\n\nAlthough DuBois had urged the Negroes to close ranks with white America\nduring the war, white racists did not reciprocate.  An even worse race\nriot occurred in East St. Louis, Illinois, in 1917. The white community\nwas afraid that a mass influx of Negroes from the South was about to\noccur. On one hand, Illinois Democrats played on racial prejudice to\nfurther their political interests. They accused Republicans of intending\nto colonize large numbers of Negroes from the South in order to enlarge\nthe Republican vote.\n\nOn the other hand, labor unions feared that Negroes would be imported as\nstrike breakers. During an attempt to organize a union at the Aluminum\nOre Company which led to a strike in April 1917 this atmosphere increased\nracial tensions. In 1913, the company had hired no Negro workers at all.\nBy 1916, there were two hundred Afro-American employees. Within three\nmonths at the end of 1916 and the beginning of 1917, the company fired\nsome two hundred whites while, at the same time, hiring approximately the\nsame number of Negroes. The city had been totally segregated, and the\nwhite citizens intended to keep it that way. The school system had been\nsegregated in spite of a state law of 1874 which forbade segregation in\neducation. Jim Crow was also standard in theaters, restaurants, and\nhotels in opposition to the 1885 law that had outlawed segregation in\npublic accommodations. Local citizens were afraid that the rumored influx\nof Negroes would drastically alter the situation. Later investigation\nshowed that the size of the migration had been vastly exaggerated.\n\nTension surrounding the racial and labor conflict in East St. Louis\nexploded into a minor riot in May. A Negro had accidentally wounded a\nwhite man during a liquor-store holdup but the story that was circulated\nwas that an innocent young white girl had been shot and killed. The white\ncommunity, especially the striking workers, became an enraged mob which\nroamed the streets beating any Negroes it could find.  The mob also\nburned Negro-owned stores and homes. The next day the National Guard\narrived and, with the help of the police, searched the Negro community\nfor weapons. In spite of the fact that the mob had been white, it was the\nNegroes who were disarmed and arrested. East St.  Louis became filled\nwith rumors that the Negroes were preparing for revenge.\n\nLate in the evening of July 1, a Ford sedan raced through the Negro\nsection of East St. Louis shooting at doors and windows as it passed.\nThe police heard that Negroes were on a shooting rampage, and they sent a\ncar to investigate. They came in another Ford sedan, and most of the\nofficers were wearing civilian dress.  In the meantime, the Negro\ncitizens had prepared for the return of the first car. As the police\nentered the poorly lit street, they were met by a barrage of bullets.\nAlmost all the officers were either killed or wounded. The white\ncommunity was outraged at what it believed to be an unprovoked attack,\nand it wanted revenge.\n\nAlthough the Guard was called again, the riot lasted for several days.\nAt one point, the white mob set a row of shacks on fire and waited in\nambush until its residents were forced to flee the flames. Then, they\ntook great delight in coldly and deliberately shooting them down as they\nfled. It was reported that some of those who were shot were thrown back\ninto the burning buildings, and others were thrown into the river.  Two\nchildren, between one and two years old, were found shot through the\nhead. At times, the mob would not let ambulances take away the wounded\nand dying. For the most part, the Guard and the police stood by.\nAccording to some reports, they occasionally participated themselves.\n\nAccording to official reports thirty-nine Negroes and two whites had been\nkilled, but the police contended that, because so many bodies had been\nburned, thrown in the river, or buried in mass graves, the figure was\nreally much larger. They estimated the number of dead at a hundred, and\nthe grand jury accepted their calculation. It was also estimated that as\nmany as 750 had been wounded. The Guard held an investigation of the\nriot, and it exonerated the behavior of its soldiers. However, a\nCongressional investigation later accused the Guard's colonel of\ncowardice, and it said that the Guard had exhibited extreme inefficiency.\nThe Washington Evening Mail carried a cartoon which depicted Wilson\nstanding before a group of Negroes reading an official document\nproclaiming that the world should be made safe for democracy.  The\ncaption over the cartoon read \"Why not make America safe?\"\n\nWhen the Negro soldiers returned home from Europe, they brought new\nexperiences and changed attitudes with them. As soldiers, they had been\ntaught to stand up and fight like men. In Europe, they had been treated\nmore like men than ever before.  The attitude of submissiveness which had\nbeen stamped on the Afro-American community by its slave mentality and\nwhich had been reinforced by the philosophy of Booker T. Washington was\nundermined by this new sense of manhood. When a wave of two dozen riots\nswept America in the summer of 1919, Negroes fought back as they had not\ndone in East St. Louis. Riots occurred in places as diverse as Longview,\nTexas, Washington, D.C., Omaha, Nebraska, and Chicago, Illinois.\n\nThe worst riot of that bloody summer occurred in Chicago. It began when a\nyoung Negro boy, swimming in Lake Michigan, crossed into a section of the\nwater which had been traditionally reserved for whites. White youths\nbegan throwing stones at him, and he drowned. A later investigation\nshowed that he had not been hit by any of these rocks.  Nevertheless,\nthis incident triggered the tense racial situation in Chicago into an\nexplosion.  Fighting broke out all over the city.  Whites pulled Negroes\nfrom streetcars and beat them openly. The fighting raged for thirteen\ndays. At least thirty-eight people were killed.  Fifteen of these were\nwhite, and twenty-three were Negro.  Also, some five hundred people were\ninjured of which the majority were Negro. Many houses were burned, and it\nwas estimated that one thousand families were left homeless.\n\n\nThe Klan Revival\n\nWhile the nation went to war to make the world safe for democracy, many\nat home believed that it was still necessary to make America safe first.\nThese people fell into two groups. There were those within the\nAfro-American community who felt that a country which systematically\ndisenfranchised a large minority group and which also tolerated\nwidespread discrimination, segregation, and violence against that\nminority was not a secure democratic state. At the same time, those who\nwere responsible for much of this harassment and terror believed that\nviolence was necessary precisely in order to protect democracy. They\nbelieved that true democracy sprang from the virtue of a white,\nAnglo-Saxon, Protestant civilization, and they wanted to protect it\nagainst alien subversion.\n\nOne of the main \"protectors\" of white American civilization was the Ku\nKlux Klan. The original Klan had thrived in the deep South immediately\nafter the Civil War. In 1915, it underwent a revival.  Inspired by the\nmigration of Afro-Americans from the South into the North and West as\nwell as by the gigantic immigration of South and East Europeans, the\nKlan, beginning in Georgia, rapidly spread beyond the South into a\nnational movement. Confidently believing in the superiority of its own\ndemocratic way of life, America had thrown open its doors to the hungry\nand oppressed of Europe. American society took pride in being the world's\ngreat melting pot. However, many old-stock Americans did not view their\nsociety as being a cultural amalgam, and they expected that the new\nEuropean immigrants, as well as the Afro-Americans, would want to be\nassimilated into their society as it already existed.  When they promised\nthe newcomers freedom and equality, many of these Americans were offering\nthese benefits expecting that the immigrants would adjust and conform.\nThey did not believe that the values and life style of foreigners were\nequal to their own, and therefore they did not want to grant the\noutsiders the freedom to \"pollute\" American society with alien cultures.\nWhen it became evident that American Negroes as well as many of these new\nimmigrants were not able to be absorbed into white, Anglo-Saxon,\nProtestant America as easily as had been expected, many ardent patriots\nbecame panic-stricken over the future of the American way of life. This\nsense of terror drove them to take extreme action in its defense.\n\nThe invisible empire of the Ku Klux Klan was the most militant and best\norganized of several defenders of this kind of American patriotism. It\nbuilt its power on a series of appeals which had deep roots throughout\nAmerican life. During the 1920s, anti-Semitism was widespread, and many\nrespectable hotels and clubs were closed to Jews. Discrimination against\nforeign-born Americans was prevalent. Many patriotic and artistic\nsocieties were exclusively for native-born Americans.  Discrimination\nagainst Afro-Americans was a national phenomenon, but in the South it was\nan orthodox social and political creed.\n\nThe revival of the Klan in 1915 was closely associated with the release\nof the famous motion picture,  The Birth of a Nation. D. W.  Griffith\nbased his movie on material taken from two novels by Thomas Dixon: The\nLeopard's Spots and The Klansman. At first Birth of a Nation was censored\nin some cities in the North and West for being inflammatory because of\nits racial attitudes.  This angered many who claimed that it was, in\nfact, a truthful account of the Klan. Concerned by the official\nopposition to the movie, Dixon contacted an old college friend who was\nthen occupying the White House. President Woodrow Wilson consented to a\nspecial White House showing of the picture. After the White House\nshowing, opposition throughout the North and West disintegrated, and the\nmovie went on to become a gigantic success. It grossed eighteen million\ndollars. While much of this success was undoubtedly due to its appeal to\ncommon underlying racial prejudice in the American character, it must\nalso be admitted that much of the popularity was due to the fact that it\nwas the first full-length successful movie and that it had much\nentertainment value.\n\nColonel William J. Simmons chose the opening of the movie in Atlanta,\nGeorgia, as the time to launch his Klan revival. His father had been a\nmember of the original Klan. When the revival began in 1915, the Klan was\nprimarily a fraternal, Caucasian-supremacy organization without the\nviolence normally associated with it. But when Simmons later decided to\ndevelop it into a larger organization, he found it necessary to adopt\nmore aggressive tactics.\n\nAt one meeting, Simmons dramatically portrayed the dynamic, hostile note\nthat helped the organization to spread and appeal to the fears and the\nhatreds of people throughout the country.  In the middle of a speech, he\nfirst drew a gun from one pocket and laid it on the table before him.\nThen, he pulled a second gun from another pocket and placed it beside the\nfirst one. Opening his jacket, he unfastened a cartridge belt and draped\nit ostentatiously across the table. Finally, he reached into still\nanother pocket, pulled out a knife and plunged it into the wood between\nthe two guns. With this flamboyant gesture, he issued a challenge to all\n\"niggers,\" Catholics, Jews, and all others.  He warned them that his\norganization and its supporters were ready to meet them and would protect\nthemselves and the American way of life from any kind of corruption.\nWhile the Klan is normally thought of as being an anti-Negro institution,\nthe other major themes on which it built in the 1920s were opposition to\nCatholicism, dope, bootlegging, gambling, roadhouses and loose sexual\nbehavior.\n\nFor the Klan, the end justified the means. Defending the values of\nAmerican society was to them so important as to condone the use of\nviolence and murder. By 1921, Klan membership had soared to 100,000 but\nits real growth had only just begun, As it came under public attack, its\npopularity increased. Newspapers and Congressmen charged that the Klan\nhad violated the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Thirteenth Amendments to\nthe Constitution. The House Rules Comittee held hearings on the Klan.\nHowever, the comittee chairman found that he lost the next election.\nNewspapers attacked the Klan in lurid headlines which, although they\nhelped to sell copy, only succeeded in making the Klan more attractive to\npotential members. By 1923 Klan membership was estimated between two and\nthree million.\n\nWhen it was at its zenith, the Klan used violence, intimidation, and\nparades to make its presence known in the community. Its members were\nprominent on police forces, sheriff departments, and various other local\nbranches of government. In the early 1920s, Klan support was responsible\nfor electing a handful of senators and several Congressmen.  Finally, in\n1924, an attempt was made to capture both political parties on the\nnational level.  Failing to get its nominee chosen as Vice President on\nthe Republican ticket, the Klan swung its full attention to the\nDemocratic convention in Madison Square Garden in New York.  Anti-Klan\nforces at the convention were also strong. The convention leadership made\nthe attempt to keep the issue in the background, but a minority report on\nthe platform resulted in forcing the convention to condemn the Klan by\nname. The convention was split in two. As a result, it took the party\nnine days and one hundred and twenty-three ballots before it was\nsuccessful in choosing its national candidates. In the following year,\nthe Klan again tried to make its presence felt on the national scene. It\nheld a march of its members in Washington. Forty thousand robed and\nhooded Klansmen marched down Pennsylvania Avenue in a display of strength\nwhile thousands more cheered and watched.\n\nThe violence which, for a short time, had helped the Klan to grow, would\neventually contribute to its decline. It appealed to public animosity\nagainst Catholics, Jews, and Negroes, but its own vitriolic crusade swung\nsegments of that same public opinion in favor of its victims. The Klan\nrevival was particularly disheartening to Negroes, who had assumed that\nthe Klan was dead. While slavery was gone, brutality and intimidation\nremained. Half a century after the demise of the original Klan, it had\nrisen again and, this time, had become a nationwide phenomenon. Jim Crow\nwas the law in the South, and racism had become rampant in the North.\nSlavery had been abolished, but Negroes were aware that they still were\nnot free.\n\n\n\n\nPART THREE  The Search For Equality\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nThe Crisis of Leadership\n\n\nThe Debate over Means and Ends\n\nIn the nineteenth century the problem that faced the Afro-American\ncommunity was how to destroy the institution of slavery.  In the\ntwentieth century the question was how to achieve equality. Frederick\nDouglass had been in the vanguard of the fight to overthrow the peculiar\ninstitution.  Later, he was among the first to realize that Emancipation\nhad not solved all the problems. It was his belief that the forces of\nracism and indifference were responsible for relegating the ex-slave to a\nsecond-class status. When the Federal Government terminated\nReconstruction without providing his people with the tools for competing\nin American society, Douglass's disappointment was severe.\n\nAt the turn of the century the focus of the problems facing\nAfro-Americans had changed. Slavery had been abolished, but not race\nprejudice. The elimination of this scourge became the basis for a new\ndrive. Douglass, who for a half century had been looked upon as the\nspokesman for his people, was too old to tackle the task of ending\nsegregation and prejudice based on race. When he died early in 1895, the\nAfro-American community was left without leadership capable of uniting\nthe diverse elements within the movement. The pressing need was for black\nmen and women to escape physical violence and to find acceptance with\ndignity, and it couldn't wait.\n\nHowever, within this community there were many who were capable of\nleadership. What was lacking were the instruments of leadership. Money,\npower, and the press, for the most part, were in the hands of whites who\nhad concluded that the ex-slave would have to solve his own problems.\nWhat this meant was that the Whites wanted to be left in peace. Dozens of\nAfro-Americans, however, were not content to accept the degrading\nposition which had been assigned to them. Utilizing the limited resources\nwithin their own community, new leadership evolved and began to debate\nthe issues of the day. Before Emancipation the problems had seemed\nsimple. All attention was focused on the abolition of slavery, and the\nonly point of controversy centered on the means by which it should be\nachieved. But segregation and discrimination were not so easily defined\nand attacked. The debates which ensued widened to include disagreement\nover both means and ends. A vocal minority, discouraged by the\nemasculating effects of discrimination, believed that they should\nwithdraw from white society altogether. Some of them wanted to return to\nAfrica and to assist its inhabitants in their liberation from European\nimperialism. They planned to create an independent African nation.\nOthers, while not wanting to leave America, still wanted to withdraw from\nwhite society into a world of their own choosing and making.\n\nThe majority, however, insisted that the African immigrant, like those\nfrom Europe, had the right to all the privileges of being American.  Some\nof them wanted to join the white society, accept its Euro-American\ncultural values, forget their past, and assimilate into the mainstream of\nAmerican life. Still others, while wanting to find their place within the\nAmerican nation, insisted that the country must be transformed into a\ngenuinely pluralistic society. While they wanted to be integrated into\nthe nation, they did not want to join the white society. Instead of\nassimilating into Anglo-Saxon culture, they wanted American civilization\nto become multi-racial, multi-ethnic, and highly fluid.\n\nThe means which were proposed to achieve these differing ends were highly\ndiverse. Some argued that the ex-slave must first demonstrate his\nreadiness to be accepted within white society.  Others claimed that they\nneed only demand the rights which were legally theirs. In order to do\nthis they planned to make aggressive use of the press and the courts.\nMass organization to achieve economic and political pressure was also\nrecommended as another technique.\n\nThere were scores of leaders representing dozens of differing positions.\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, the spectrum was limited\nalmost exclusively to the advocacy of nonviolent techniques.  Four of\nthese leaders will be discussed below. Their ideas present a broad\noverview of the concepts to be found within the Afro-American community.\nBooker T. Washington, W. E. B. DuBois, Marcus Garvey, and A.  Philip\nRandolph represented a wide variety of approaches, their ideas forming\nthe total spectrum of the thrust for remaking the black role in white\nsociety.\n\n\nBooker T. Washington: The Trumpet of Conciliation\n\nWithin a few months of Douglass's death, a new leader was thrust upon the\nAfro-American community. Unlike Douglass, who believed in self-assertion,\nBooker T. Washington developed a leadership style based on the model of\nthe old plantation house servant. He used humility, politeness, flattery,\nand restraint as a wedge with which he hoped to split the wall of racial\ndiscrimination. His conciliatory approach won the enthusiastic support of\nthe solid South as well as that of influential Northern politicians and\nindustrialists, Their backing gained him a national reputation and\nprovided him with easy access to the press. Members of his own community\nwere filled with pride to see one of their own treated with such respect\nby wealthy and influential leaders of white America. When Theodore\nRoosevelt entertained Washington for dinner at the White House, the\nAfro-American community was overjoyed. However, some whites believed that\nit had been a dangerous breach of etiquette. Nevertheless, there were\nthose within the Afro-American community who were not enthusiastic about\ntheir new leader. They believed that conciliation was the road to\nsurrender and not the way to victory.\n\nBooker T. Washington was born into slavery on April 5, 1856. His mother\nhad been a slave in Franklin County, Virginia. The identity of his white\nfather remains unknown. After Emancipation the family moved to West\nVirginia where it struggled to achieve a livelihood. Young Booker\nattended a school for the children of ex-slaves while, at the same time,\nholding down a full-time job in the mines. As a courteous, cooperative,\nhard-working young man he secured a job cleaning and doing other tasks\naround the house of one of the mine owners. This occupation was less\nstrenuous than working in the mines, and it left him more energy to\npursue his studies, In 1872, with nothing to help him besides his\ndetermination, he traveled and worked his way hundreds of miles to\nHampton Institute. Undaunted by lack of tuition, he insisted that he\ncould do some useful work to cover his expenses. When he was directed to\nclean the adjoining room as a kind of entrance test, his response was to\napply himself to the task. When the teacher's  white handkerchief could\nnot discover any dirt in the room, she was so impressed with his work and\nwith his genial personality that she admitted him to the institute and\nfound a janitorial job to ease his financial situation.\n\nHampton Normal and Agricultural Institute had been started after the\nCivil War by General Samuel Armstrong to train ex-slaves to lead their\npeople in pursuit of land and homes. Armstrong strongly believed that\nthey should not be given what they could earn for themselves.  Therefore,\nthe institute strove to teach the student manners, cleanliness, morality,\nand practical skills with which to make a living, He believed that hard\nwork for its own sake developed moral virtue, and he tried to instill\nthis respect for labor into his students.\n\nAfter graduating, Washington became an instructor at Hampton Institute.\nThen in 1881, he was invited to Tuskegee, Alabama, to found a similar\nschool there. Louis Adams, a skilled freedman, had made a political deal\nwhich led to the establishment of the Tuskegee Institute. In return for\nhis delivery of the Negro vote, the state legislature provided minimal\nfunds for educating ex-slaves. The roof of the building which they were\nusing leaked and the students often had to study with umbrellas over\ntheir heads.\n\nIn effect, the institute became a kind of commune. The students grew\ntheir own food on the adjoining land, and they erected their own\nbuildings. They sold their excess produce to the citizens of Tuskegee.\nThey also developed skills in carpentry, brick-making, and a score of\nother trades and sold their products to the community. Gradually, as the\nwhite citizens realized that the school was not developing aggressive\nblacks and that the students were providing a contribution to the\ncommunity, they came to accept it and to help it to develop by\ncontributing funds and supplies. They found that Tuskegee students were\nhard-working, courteous, and humble instead of being self-assertive and\narticulate. They realized that their fears of educating the ex-slave had\nbeen unfounded.\n\nIn an attempt to lure more business and industry into the South,\npolitical leaders scheduled a trade exposition for Atlanta, Georgia, in\n1895. A delegation was sent to the nation's capital to request financial\naid from a Congressional comittee. Booker T. Washington was included in\nthe delegation as a token that there was backing from all portions of the\ncommunity for the project. Speaking to the comittee, Washington said\nthat: \"the Negro should not be deprived by unfair means of the franchise,\npolitical agitation alone would not save him, and that to back the ballot\nhe must have property, industry, skill, economy, intelligence, and\ncharacter, and that no race without these elements could permanently\nsucceed.\"\n\nThe delegation admitted that his oratory had significantly helped their\ncause. They were impressed with his racial views, particularly when he\nstated that character development was more important than political\nagitation. This was a position which they could whole-heartily endorse.\n\nThe Cotton States Exposition which was held in Atlanta in 1895 strove to\nproject an image of the South as a peaceful and prosperous region.  It\ntried to represent the South as a desirable location for future financial\ninvestment. Part of the peaceful image which it tried to create was a\npicture of racial harmony.  The Exposition had a pavilion which was built\nby ex-slaves and which displayed their products, and it was decided to\ninvite a Negro to speak at the Exposition. The choice fell on Booker T.\nWashington. His famous speech, which later became known as \"The Atlanta\nCompromise\", lay heavily on his mind for many weeks before its delivery.\nHe wanted to cement racial relations as well as to advance the status of\nhis people. He was afraid of saying something which might undermine the\ncause.\n\nWashington's speech was built around two graphic images. In the first, he\ntold the story of a ship at sea which was out of fresh water. It signaled\na passing vessel that it needed fresh water.  The other ship told them to\nlet down their bucket. Finally, after much consternation, the crew\ncomplied. Instead of finding salt water as they had expected, the bucket\nwas pulled up filled with fresh water from the mouth of the Amazon.\nWashington used this image to suggest that the racial situation could be\nimproved if both races would begin from where they were. The second\npicture which he used was that of the hand. He pointed out that while the\nhand was one, the fingers were separate. Similarly, he suggested that\nnational unity and social segregation could go together.\n\nWashington built on the image of the ship's needing fresh water to\npersuade Negroes to start where they were in building their future. He\nsaid:\n\n\"To those of my race who depend on bettering their condition in a foreign\nland or who underestimate the importance of cultivating friendly\nrelations with the southern white man, who is their next-door neighbor, I\nwould say: 'Cast down your bucket where you are, cast it down in making\nfriends in every manly way of the people of all races by whom we are\nsurrounded. Cast it down in agriculture, mechanics, in commerce, in\ndomestic service, and in the professions. And in this connection it is\nwell to bear in mind that whatever other sins the South may be called to\nbear, when it comes to business, pure and simple, it is in the South that\nthe Negro is given a man's chance in the commercial world, and in nothing\nis this Exposition more eloquent than in emphasizing this chance. Our\ngreatest danger is that in the great leap from slavery to freedom we may\noverlook the fact that the masses of us are to live by the productions of\nour hands, and fail to keep in mind that we shall prosper in proportion\nas we learn to dignify and glorify common labor and put brains and skill\ninto the common occupations of life; shall prosper in proportion as we\nlearn to draw the line between the superficial and the substantial, the\nornamental gewgaws of life and the useful.  No race can prosper till it\nlearns that there is as much dignity in tilling a field as in writing a\npoem.  It is at the bottom of life we must begin, and not at the top. Nor\nshould we permit our grievances to overshadow our opportunities.\"\n\nWashington then turned to the whites in the audience and urged them to\nstart where they were in building national prosperity and racial unity.\nHe said:\n\n\"To those of the white race who look to the incoming of those of foreign\nbirth and strange tongue and habits for the prosperity of the South, were\nI permitted I would repeat what I say to my own race, 'Cast down your\nbucket where you are.' Cast it down among the eight millions of Negroes\nwhose habits you know, whose fidelity and love you have tested in days\nwhen to have proved treacherous meant the ruin of your firesides. Cast\ndown your bucket among these people who have, without strikes and labor\nwars, tilled your fields, cleared your forests, builded your railroads\nand cities, and brought forth treasures from the bowels of the earth, and\nhelped make possible this magnificent representation of the progress of\nthe South. Casting down your bucket among my people, helping and\nencouraging them as you are doing on these grounds, and to education of\nhead, hand, and heart, you will find that they will buy your surplus\nland, make blossom the waste places in your fields, and run your\nfactories.  While doing this, you can be sure in the future, as in the\npast, that you and your families will be surrounded by the most patient,\nfaithful, law-abiding, and unresentful people that the world has seen....\nso in the future, in our humble way, we shall stand by you with a\ndevotion that no foreigner can approach, ready to lay down our lives, if\nneed be, in defence of yours, interlacing our industrial, commercial,\ncivil, and religious life with yours in a way that shall make the\ninterests of both races one.\"\n\nHe summed up his plea for racial cooperation with the second pictorial\nimage. He told the audience that \"In all things that are purely social we\ncan be as separate as the fingers, yet as one as the hand in all things\nessential to mutual progress.\" This proposal brought forth thunderous\napplause. He went on to say that the wisest in his race were aware that\nfighting for social equality was folly. The ex-slave, he believed, must\nfirst struggle and prepare himself for the assumption of his rights,\nwhich were privileges to be earned. While he did believe that his people\nwould receive their full rights at some future date, he insisted that\n\"The opportunity to earn a dollar in a factory just now is worth\ninfinitely more than the opportunity to spend a dollar in an\nopera-house.\"  Economic opportunity was far more important than either\nsocial equality or political rights. He closed the speech by praising the\nExposition for the effect it would have in bringing fresh material\nprosperity to the South, and added:\n\n\"... yet far above and beyond material benefits will be that higher good,\nthat, let us pray God, will come, in a blotting out of sectional\ndifferences and racial animosities and suspicions, in a determination to\nadminister absolute justice, in a willing obedience among all classes to\nthe mandates of law.  This, coupled with our material prosperity, will\nbring into our beloved South a new heaven and a new earth.\"\n\nWhen he finished, the audience applauded wildly. Governor Bullock rushed\nacross the platform and shook his hand. The next day he was greeted and\npraised enthusiastically on the Atlanta streets.  President Cleveland,\nafter having read the speech, wrote Washington and thanked him for what\nhe had said. The following year Harvard University granted him an\nhonorary Master's degree.  The press both North and South quoted all or\nparts of the speech, and most of the newspapers carried appreciative\neditorials. The Charleston News and Courier, for example said \"His skin\nis colored, but his head is sound, and his heart is in the right place.\"\nMoney poured in to finance the Tuskegee Institute.  Overnight Washington\nwas skyrocketed to national fame.\n\nHowever, there were those who did not appreciate their new leader's call\nto conciliation. In view of the growing virulence of racism and the\nspread of Jim Crow legislation, they believed that his refusal to demand\ntheir rights was, in fact, a form of emasculation.\n\nJohn Hope was one of those who had heard the Atlanta speech and did not\nwant to accept the compromise. He was a professor at Roger Williams\nUniversity in Nashville, Tennessee, and later was to become president of\nAtlanta University. The following year, after carefully considering\nWashington's speech, he made an address of his own to his colleagues in\nNashville. He bitterly attacked the compromise and said that he believed\nit to be cowardly for a black man to admit that his people were not\nstriving for equality. If money, education, and honesty would not bring\nthe black man as much respect as they would to another American citizen,\nthey were a curse and not a blessing.\n\nThis was obviously an attack on Washington's statement that the right to\nearn a dollar was worth more than anything else. He said that if he did\nnot have the right to spend a dollar in the opera house and to do those\nthings that other free men do, he was not free. Hope was not content with\ndemanding equality in vague terms. He insisted that what he wanted was\nsocial equality.  Instead of urging conciliation, he advocated that the\nAfro-Americans should be restless and dissatisfied.  When their\ndiscontent broke through the wall of discrimination, then there would be\nno need to plead for Justice. Then they would be men. A decade later,\nthose who opposed Washington's leadership decided that they needed to\norganize and coordinate their activities.\n\nJohn Hope, W. E. B. DuBois, Monroe Trotter, and several others wanted to\nspeak out more vigorously against racial discrimination, segregation, and\nlynching. To do this, they created the Niagara Movement to challenge the\npolitical domination of Washington's Tuskegee machine. Because he was the\nrecognized advisor to politicians and philanthropists, this was a\ndifficult task. Hope's criticism resulted in the diminution of financial\nsupport to Atlanta University where Hope was president.\n\nW. E. B. DuBois, who was a professor at Atlanta University at that time,\ncharged that:\n\n\"Mr. Washington distinctly asks that black people give up, at least for\nthe present, three things,--First, political power; second, insistence on\ncivil rights; Third, higher education of Negro youth,--and concentrate\ntheir energies on industrial education, the accumulation of wealth, and\nthe conciliation of the South.... As a result of this tender of the\npalm-branch, what has been the return? In these years there have\noccurred: 1. The disenfranchisement of the Negro. 2. The legal creation\nof a distinct status of civil inferiority for the Negro.  3. The steady\nwithdrawal of aid from institutions for the higher training of the Negro.\nThese movements are not, to be sure, direct results of Mr. Washington's\nteachings; but his propaganda has, without a shadow of a doubt, helped\ntheir speedier accomplishment. The question then comes: Is it possible,\nand probable, that nine millions of men can make effective progress in\neconomic lines if they are deprived of political rights, made a servile\ncaste, and allowed only the most meager chance for developing their\nexceptional men? If history and reason give any distinct answer to these\nquestions, it is an emphatic No.\"\n\nHe believed that beginning at the bottom with a humble trade was the best\nway to stay at the bottom, respect should be worth more than material\nadvancement. He believed that Washington's policy had replaced manliness\nwith a shallow materialism. Monroe Trotter edited the Boston Guardian\nwhich was one of the most militant papers published in the Afro-American\ncommunity. Trotter used it as a platform from which to attack\nWashington's leadership. On one occasion when Washington was speaking in\nBoston, Trotter was among those arrested for creating a disturbance\nduring the lecture. When the Niagara Movement was dissolved in 1909 and\nmost of its leaders joined with liberal whites in founding the National\nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, Trotter refused to\nfollow them.  Besides distrusting the conciliatory policies of\nWashington, he could not put his trust in an integrated movement.\n\nIn the years immediately preceding his death in 1915, Washington hinted\nat a growing disillusionment with the way in which his compromise had\nworked. In 1912 he wrote an article for Century magazine entitled \"Is the\nNegro Having a Fair Chance?\" In it he criticized the fact that more money\nwas appropriated for the education of whites than of blacks. He also\ncriticized the convict lease system which had developed in the South. His\ndissatisfaction with segregation became clear when he pointed out that\nalthough Jim Crow facilities might be separate they were never equal.\nAnother article which he had written was published after his death in the\nNew Republic. In it he described the terrible effects of segregation. He\nsaid that it meant inferior sidewalks, inferior street-lighting, inferior\nsewage facilities, and inferior police protection. Such lacks made for\ndifficult neighborhoods in which to raise families in decency.\n\nIf Washington's program was a sellout, as many believed, it is becoming\nincreasingly clear that he did not intend his compromise as an end in\nitself. He believed that it could be the means to a much broader future.\nWhen he spoke before the Congressional comittee early in 1895, he\nexpressed his opposition to disenfranchisement on a racial basis.  His\napparent acceptance of it at Atlanta was only a tactical maneuver.  In an\narticle which he wrote in 1898, he said that he believed that the time\nwould come when his people would be given all of their rights in the\nSouth. He said that they would receive the privileges due to any citizen\non the basis of ability, character, and material possessions.  He was, in\neffect, approving disenfranchisement of the poor and ignorant in both\nraces. When Negroes did receive what was due them as citizens, he said,\nit would come from Southern whites as the result of the natural evolution\nof mutual trust and acceptance. Artificial external pressure, he\ninsisted, would not help.\n\nThe Atlanta Compromise was to be the means to an end and not an end in\nitself. If the ex-slave would start at the bottom, develop manners and\nfriendliness, Washington believed that he could make his labor\nindispensable to white society. Acceptance of segregation was, at that\ntime, a necessary part of good behavior. If the whites, in turn, opened\nthe doors of economic opportunity to the ex-slave instead of importing\nmore European immigrants, Washington said that the nation would have an\nEnglish-speaking non-striking labor force. Gradually, individual\nAfro-Americans would gain trust, acceptance, and respect. The class line\nbased on color would be replaced by one based on intelligence and\nmorality.\n\nWashington seemed to be unaware that a race which began at the bottom\ncould stay at the bottom. In an age of rapid urbanization and\nindustrialization a strategy which emphasized craft and agriculture was\ndrastically out of step with the economic realities. Moreover the nation\ndid not accept its part of the compromise. The flood of immigration\ncontinued unabated for another two decades. When Afro-Americans were\ngiven opportunities in industry, it became clear that there were black\njobs and white jobs. The former were always poorly paid.\n\nThere were two bases for Washington's belief that the Negro should start\nat the bottom and work his way up. The nineteenth-century economic creed\nhad taught that hard work unlocked the door which led from rags to\nriches. This teaching was also reinforced by Washington's own experience.\nBorn in slavery and poverty, he rose from obscurity to fame and influence\nthrough honesty and industry. However, Washington seemed unaware that the\nmost which his policy could ever achieve was a token acceptance which\nwould leave the Negro masses behind.\n\n\nW. E. B. DuBois:  The Trumpet of Confrontation\n\nIn contrast to Washington's policy of conciliation and compromise, W.  E.\nB. DuBois believed that it was necessary to act like men in order to be\naccepted as men, Speaking the truth as he saw it, loudly, clearly, and\nfearlessly, was to him the minimum criterion for manliness. This led to a\ncontrasting style of leadership. Where Washington had been polite and\ningratiating, DuBois was self-assertive and, frequently, aggressive.\nWhere Washington had tried to win the trust of white bigots, DuBois\ninsisted on confronting them with the truth as he saw it. Where\nWashington had counseled peace, DuBois clamored for action.\n\nThe contrasting leadership styles of Washington and DuBois were rooted in\ntheir differing life experiences. DuBois was born in February, 1868, in\nGreat Barrington, Massachusetts. His grandfather had procured his own\nfreedom through participating in the American Revolution. DuBois received\nhis elementary and secondary education in an integrated setting which\nprevented his becoming conscious of the color bar.  However, receiving an\nintegrated college education was not so simple.  Instead he headed South\nto Fisk University to further his education, There, the daily insults of\ndiscrimination and segregation came to him as a shock. He had not been\ntrained to accept them, and these daily harassments filled him with anger\nand hostility. He returned north to pursue his graduate education at\nHarvard University, and he also spent some time at the University of\nBerlin exploring the new field of sociology.\n\nDuBois's first-class education as well as his own scholarly bent led him\nto put considerable faith in reason and learning as the tools with which\nto rebuild the world. He came to believe that bigotry and discrimination\nwere rooted in ignorance and that scholarship could destroy them by\nexposing them to the light of truth. He strove to demonstrate that the\nAfro-American was not innately inferior and that his inferior status\nsprang from his unequal and unfair treatment in America.\n\nWhile at Harvard, he wrote \"The Suppression of the African Slave Trade\"\nwhich was of such high quality that it became the first volume in an\nimportant historical series published by Harvard. Soon afterwards, while\nteaching at the University of Pennsylvania, he conducted extensive\nsociological research which resulted in \"The Philadelphia Negro\". This\npioneering sociological work was valuable for the understanding of the\nNegro in Philadelphia and throughout the North, At that time sociology\nwas a new field, and there was not a single institution of higher\nlearning in the United States or the world which had adopted it as the\ntool for studying the problems of minority groups. Atlanta University\ninvited DuBois to come there and teach and to conduct sociological\nstudies. There he began a research department which was devoted to\nstudying the problems of the Afro-American community and which resulted\nin the production of a dozen works.\n\nBesides his interest in scholarly research, DuBois developed a theory of\nracial leadership. For a people to advance, he believed, they needed\nleaders. If they failed to develop such people of their own, they would\nbe guided by others. DuBois was doubtful whether his people should\nentrust themselves to white leaders. He agreed with Washington that the\nmasses would have to make their living with their hands, and he also\nbelieved that it was important for them to develop skills which would\nhelp them.  While wanting to assist the masses, however, he argued that\nthe important priority, at the beginning, must be given to training a\nleadership elite which he called \"the talented tenth.\" \"The Negro race,\nlike all races, is going to be saved by its exceptional men. The problem\nof education, then, among Negroes must first of all deal with the\nTalented Tenth; it is the problem of developing the Best of this race\nthat they may guide the Mass away from the contamination and death of the\nWorst, in their own and other races.\"  This influential aristocracy would\ninclude scholars who would unearth the facts about the race and its\nproblems. It would provide leaders who would examine those facts, make\nkey decisions, and lead the race forward. This elite would also include\nprofessionals and businessmen who would set an example of good\ncitizenship for the whole community.\n\nMoreover, the achievements of \"the talented tenth\" would provide living\nevidence that the racial stereotypes held by white bigots were untrue.\nThis would lead gradually to the acceptance of \"the talented tenth\"\nwithin the majority community, and they would provide the wedge which\nwould break open the walls of prejudice and discrimination forever.\n\nHis work at Atlanta University was only one of the ways by which he\nstrove to build \"the talented tenth.\" In 1905 DuBois and several others\nhad founded the Niagara Movement to provide a common platform from which\nto speak. They also intended it to become the framework within which they\ncould exchange their ideas. In it \"the talented tenth\" tried to oppose\nthe policies of conciliation and submission which were being propounded\nby Booker T. Washington. However, in 1906 Atlanta was rocked by a race\nriot which shook DuBois's faith in reason and scholarship as a panacea.\nIn the very city in which he lived and where his influence should have\nbeen strongest, white bigotry exploded, and mobs roamed the streets for\ndays beating Afro-American citizens and burning their homes. DuBois began\nto wonder whether scholarly discovery of the truth was enough.\n\nFollowing another race riot in Springfield, Illinois, in 1908 and the\nfounding of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored\nPeople, DuBois left his post at Atlanta to become the director of\npublicity and research for the N.A.A.C.P. While continuing his interest\nin scholarly research, his new job involved him in  the aggressive\nexposure and condemnation of discrimination. He became editor of \"Crisis\"\nwhich he developed into a journal of protest. Instead of a scholar\ndispassionately unearthing and publishing his findings, DuBois's new\nposition made him a passionate journalist and engaged him in a righteous\ncrusade.\n\nHowever, some blacks questioned the wisdom of entrusting their future to\na biracial organization like the N.A.A.C.P. When it was formed, Monroe\nTrotter refused to join it, claiming that its white membership would\nblunt its efficiency and militancy.  The fact that for many years DuBois\nwas the only black on its executive board led many to wonder whether it\nhad genuine biracial participation in its decision making.\n\nLater, Ralph J. Bunche, professor of political science, U. N.  diplomat,\nand winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, attacked the N.A.A.C.P.  on the same\ngrounds. He argued that its dependence on white middle-class leaders, to\nprovide financial backing, the sympathy of a large segment of the public,\nand on favorable court decisions prevented it from achieving significant\nresults. He claimed that whenever a controversial crisis arose, it would\nbe prohibited from taking a truly militant position. Even if its white\nleadership was capable of making such a radical decision, it was always\nforced to consider the effect of an action on its white, middle-class,\nliberal financial backers.\n\nBunche also criticized the N.A.A.C.P. for relying on the courts and the\nConstitution for support. He claimed that the Constitution was a brief,\ngeneral document which always required interpretation to relate it to\nspecific, contemporary issues.  This interpretation, he maintained, was\nalways shared by public opinion. While the courts' understanding of the\nConstitution might not always conform precisely to the majority opinion,\nthe influential, vocal, and dominant segment of the public inevitably\ninfluenced the courts' thinking on important subjects. While in\nindividual cases it might even contradict this force, in the long run the\nConstitution could never be more than what the vocal majority wanted it\nto be. Bunche believed that the N.A.A.C.P.  thinking was always sensitive\nto the feelings of the white middle class, and therefore could never\nafford to alienate that group.  At the same time, he believed that racism\nwas so ingrained in the white mentality that it would have to receive a\nseries of hard jolts if significant changes were to occur.\n\nIn the final analysis, he said, the N.A.A.C.P. would have to bargain and\nconciliate. Like Booker T. Washington, he felt that it could not afford\nto be as militant as was necessary. At about the same time DuBois,\nhimself, became disillusioned with the gradual conciliatory approach of\nthe N.A.A.C.P. While he still wanted to work for a integrated society, he\nhad lost faith in the effectiveness of a biracial organization to achieve\nsignificant change. In an article which he wrote in Crisis before\nresigning from the N.A.A.C.P., he suggested that black separatism or\nblack unity could provide a more solid front with which to attack\ndiscrimination and segregation than cooperation with white society. His\ngoal, he insisted, was still to make ten million of his people free. He\nwanted to help them break the bondage of economic oppression, to shake\noff the chains of ignorance, to gain their full political rights, and to\nbecome exempt from the insults of discrimination and segregation.\n\nThis kind of freedom, he maintained, was not inconsistent with\nself-organization for self-advancement. He wanted to see the\nAfro-American community develop control over its own churches, schools,\nsocial clubs, and businesses. This was not, DuBois insisted, a surrender\nto segregation. He believed that a community which controlled its own\nbasic institutions was in a better position to make its own decisions and\nwork for its own advancement. This solidarity and cooperation was\nnecessary to achieve significant change resulting in an integrated\nsociety.  Indirectly, he admitted that this was a shift away from his\nconcept of \"the talented tenth.\" The assumption that an educated and\ncultured elite would be accepted within white society had proved to be\nerroneous. To the contrary, he noted, whites often feared educated blacks\nas much or more than uneducated ones. \"The talented tenth\" had not even\ngained token acceptance. Therefore DuBois shifted to a concept of a group\nsolidarity instead of an elite leadership. This concept of group\ncooperation must not be confused with that of Washington. DuBois's type\nof solidarity was to be the platform from which to assert one's manhood\neven if it meant personal deprivation:\n\n\"Surely then, in this period of frustration and disappointment, we must\nturn from negation to affirmation, from the ever-lasting 'No' to the\never-lasting 'Yes.' Instead of sitting, sapped of all initiative and\nindependence; instead of drowning our originality in imitation of\nmediocre white folks; instead of being afraid of ourselves and\ncultivating the art of skulking to escape the Color Line; we have got to\nrenounce a program that always involves humiliating self-stultifying\nscrambling to crawl somewhere where we are not wanted; where we crouch\npanting like a whipped dog. We have got to stop this and learn that on\nsuch a program they cannot build manhood. No, by God, stand erect in a\nmud-puddle and tell the white world to go to hell, rather than lick boots\nin a parlor.\"\n\nBoth Walter White and James Weldon Johnson took on the task of countering\nDuBois's position. Johnson argued that DuBois ended where Washington\nbegan. He noted that the conflict between integration into a biracial\nsociety and withdrawal into black separatism had existed throughout\nAmerican history. There had always been a minority who wanted to build a\nseparate community, but he said that what was favored by the majority was\nto gain entrance into American society. Yet the daily insults which were\nfelt even by the most avid integrationists led them to curse white\nsociety and, at times, to consider retreat into isolationism. According\nto his point of view, Johnson pointed out, isolationism had to be based\non economics and although one could talk about black capitalism and could\neven develop some prospering businesses, the economic realities favored\nmass production and economic interdependence. Separate black institutions\nwere always contingent institutions which were subservient to the country\nas a whole.  Therefore they could never really be free or independent.\nThe separate society would always be subject to external control by the\nlarger economic and political institutions on which it relied. Johnson\nalso noted that integrationists like himself had been charged with\nfailing to see the intensity of the institutional racism which existed\nall about them. He denied this and claimed that racism and discrimination\nwere patently obvious. To the contrary, he suggested that the real danger\nwas in overemphasizing their importance and becoming paranoid.\n\nAfter the Second World War, DuBois Joined the N.A.A.C.P. staff for\nanother short period. However, his disillusionment with society had\ndeepened, and he was ready to consider even more radical solutions than\nbefore. He had become increasingly convinced that racism was a world\nproblem and not merely an American problem. The series of Pan-African\nCongresses which he had helped to organize forced him to see a connection\nbetween American racism and European imperialism in Africa.  At the same\ntime, communism was representing itself as the foe of both racism and\nimperialism, and for many of the oppressed peoples throughout the world\nthe communist claim had become attractive.  To the N.A.A.C.P. it seemed\nthat DuBois's new \"pink\" ideas and associations were not good for its\nimage, and it asked him to resign. The government charged DuBois with\nfailing to register the \"Peace Information Center\", where he was\nemployed, as an agent for a foreign principal. Although acquitted, the\nharassment deepened his cynicism and hostility. Finally, he became a\ncommunist, and he moved to Ghana in 1960. He died there in 1963.  As a\nyoung scholar, DuBois had begun by believing that reason and research\nwould dispel ignorance and prejudice. Obviously, prejudice was not so\neasily eradicated by reason alone. \"The talented tenth,\" which was to\nlead the Afro-American community into the mainstream of American life,\nhad not been successful.  White bigots were especially antagonized by\neducated blacks. When DuBois had advocated black solidarity, it had\nfailed to take root because the intellectuals had become alienated from\nthe masses.  The black bourgeoisie had been hindered by their color from\nassimilating into white society, and their newly acquired education,\nvalues, and middle-class style of life prevented them from returning to\ntheir people. Finally, DuBois's work with the N.A.A.C.P., while it\nachieved some significant results, failed to bring about the kind of\nstructural social change he desired.  Despairing of bring about racial\nadvancement in America, DuBois decided to work for it in Africa.\n\n\nMarcus Garvey: The Trumpet of Pride\n\nMarcus Garvey's personality differed markedly from that of both Booker T.\nWashington and W. E. B. DuBois. Washington's image was one of humility\nand courageousness bordering, many believed, on obsequiousness. DuBois\nprojected the picture of a self-confident, hostile, and reserved\nindividual. In contrast, Garvey was easy-going and flamboyant. The\npersonalities of both Washington and DuBois minimized the fact that they\nwere black. On one hand, Washington appeared to be a man who knew his\nplace and who did not intrude as an individual or a Negro into any\nsituation. On the other hand, DuBois had shaken off the habits of both\nthe \"house nigger\" and the \"field nigger\" in order to adopt the\ncharacteristics of a cold intellectual which was more in keeping with the\nAnglo-Saxon character. Garvey, however, flaunted his blackness wherever\nhe went. Black pride and black identity were the cornerstones of his\nphilosophy, and they vibrated through everything he said and did. He was\nnot ashamed of the personality characteristics of the lower classes, and\nhe readily identified with them. It was the black middle class, which had\nadopted the life style of the mainstream of white society, that earned\nhis scorn.\n\nMarcus Garvey was born in St. Anne's Bay, Jamaica, in August, 1887. His\nparents were of unmixed African descent. His ancestors had belonged to\nthe Maroons, a group of slaves who had escaped and established their own\ncommunity in the Jamaican hills. They fought so well and had been so\nthoroughly organized that the British found it necessary to grant them\ntheir independence  in 1739. Garvey was very proud of this heritage and\nof his unmixed ancestry. Jamaican society was structured hierarchically\nalong color lines. The whites were at the top, mulattoes in the middle,\nand blacks at the bottom. The mulattoes enjoyed displaying and projecting\ntheir superiority over the blacks. In turn, Garvey was scornful of the\nmulattoes, and he distrusted all people with light skin throughout his\nlife.\n\nAs a young man, Garvey began making his living as a printer's helper in a\nlarge Kingston printing firm and worked his way up to foreman. His\nleadership ability became evident when, during a walkout, the workers\nchose him to lead the strike. He had been the only foreman to join the\nworkers, and the company later black-listed him for it. The union failed\nto come to his aid, and thereafter he distrusted labor organizations as a\nsource of help for his people.\n\nHe then traveled extensively around Central and South America, staying\nbriefly in several large cities and supporting himself by his trade.\nWherever he went, he found blacks being persecuted and mistreated. In\n1912 he crossed the Atlantic and spent some time in London. There he met\nlarge numbers of Africans and became interested in their plight as well.\nWhile he was there, he was influenced by a Negro Egyptian author named\nDuse Mohammed Ali.  His ideas further intensified Garvey's interest in\nAfrica. At the same time, Garvey read Booker T.  Washington's \"Up From\nSlavery\" and was impressed with his philosophy of self-help and moral\nuplift.\n\nBy this time, Garvey had become aware that black people were persecuted\nall around the world in the West Indies, in Central America, in South\nAmerica, in the United States, and even in Africa, their homeland. When\nhe returned to Jamaica, he determined to establish an organization to\nwork for the improvement of the conditions of black people the world\nover. The result was the founding, in 1914, of the \"Universal Negro\nImprovement and Conservation Association and African Communities League\".\nIn 1916, Garvey came to the United States to solicit the support of\nAfro-Americans. He had hoped to get the backing of Booker T.  Washington\nwith whom he had already corresponded, but, unfortunately, Washington\ndied the previous year.\n\nIn the United States Garvey found the Afro-American community ready to\nsupport his program of encouraging aggressive racial pride.  The hopes\nwhich had accompanied the end of slavery, half a century earlier, had\nturned to ashes. Then, thousands moved from the rural South to the urban\nNorth to escape the growth of segregation and to find economic\nadvancement. In the \"promised land,\" they were continually confronted by\nsocially sanctioned segregation, constant racial insults, and relentless\njob discrimination.\n\nIn 1919 white race hatred exploded in race riots all across the country.\nIn that year, there were also some seventy lynchings, mostly black, and\nsome of them were soldiers who had Just returned from defending their\ncountry. Urban whites resented the influx of rural blacks from the South\nwho were pouring into their cities, and they tried to confine the\nnewcomers to dilapidated, older neighborhoods. To do this, they were\nquite willing to resort to violence, and, between 1917 and 1921 Chicago\nwas struck with a rash of house bombings as whites tried to hold the\nline.  During these years, there was one racially motivated bombing every\ntwenty days.\n\nIn the midst of such conditions, white America did not seem very\nbeautiful, and black pride, black identity, and black solidarity had an\nappeal which was novel. Chapters of the Universal Negro Improvement\nAssociation sprang up all across the country.  Although there has been\nconsiderable debate about the number of members in the U.N.I.A., it was\nclearly the largest mass organization in Afro-American history. Its\nmembership has been estimated between two and four million. In any case,\nits sympathizers and well-wishers were ubiquitous. The \"respectable\"\nN.A.A.C.P. never reached such grass-roots support, and even with its\nwhite liberal financing, its capital was much smaller than that which\nGarvey was able to tap from the lower-class blacks alone.\n\nGarvey advocated a philosophy of race redemption. He said that blacks\nneeded a nation of their own where they could demonstrate their abilities\nand develop their talents. He believed that every people should have its\nown country. The white man had Europe, and the black man should have\nAfrica.  Race redemption did not mean that all blacks must return to\nAfrica. However, when there was a prosperous, independent African nation,\nblacks throughout the world would be treated with respect. He noted that\nEnglishmen and Frenchmen were not lynched, but that blacks, in contrast,\nwere treated like lepers. Garvey did plan to encourage those blacks who\nhad particularly useful skills or who desired to return to Africa to do\nso, in order to become the back-bone of this new prosperous black nation.\n\nGarvey was harshly critical of the leadership in the Afro-American\ncommunity. With the exception of Booker T. Washington, they had all\nadvocated social equality, intermarriage, and fraternization. Garvey said\nthat these only led to increased racial friction, He argued that racial\npurity for both whites and blacks was superior to racial integration,\nBlacks should also be proud of their race and their ancestry. Africa was\nnot a dark and degenerate continent; instead it was a place of which to\nbe proud.\n\nTo demonstrate this, Garvey adopted African clothes and hair style long\nbefore they became popular. The black bourgeoisie was shocked and ashamed\nby his blatant display. Whites were totally incapable of understanding\nwhy anyone would try to glorify blackness and the African heritage. To\nthem, he seemed merely a clown. However, to the black masses who had no\nhope of achieving middle-class respectability, his pride in blackness\ncame as a release. Instead of a life buried in shame, he offered them\npride and dignity. Instead of being considered \"nobodies,\" he gave them a\nsense of identity. In place of weakness, he offered solidarity and\nstrength. These ideas spread through the ghettoes of large American urban\ncenters like a fever. In 1920 the Universal Negro Improvement Association\nheld its annual convention at Madison Square Garden in New York City.\nThere were 25,000 delegates in attendance. Garvey told them that he\nplanned to organize the four hundred million blacks of the world into one\npowerful unit and to plant the banner of freedom in Africa. In response,\nthe convention elected him as the Provisional President of Africa.\n\nGarvey's black separatism led, naturally enough, to black capitalism.\nBusinesses connected with the U.N.I.A. sprang up all across the country.\nThey were usually small enterprises: grocery stores, laundries, and\nrestaurants. Larger businesses included a printing house and a steamship\nline. The New York World, which was begun in 1918, was the only black\ndaily in existence at that time.  After its demise, Garvey began The\nBlack Man, which was published monthly. Although most of these businesses\nonly served to sink Negro roots deeper in American society, the purpose\nof the Black Star Steamship Line was, eventually, to provide a means of\ntransportation for those who desired to return to Africa. The black\nmiddle class felt that Garvey was hurting its image.  White politicians\nwere nervous about the existence of such a large and potentially powerful\norganization, especially when it was led by a man like Garvey whom they\ncould not understand. When the steamship line ran into financial trouble,\nmany were convinced that Garvey had been defrauding the ignorant masses.\n\nAfter a power struggle within the U.N.I.A., Eason, who had led the fight,\nwas murdered in New Orleans. Two Garveyites were accused of the crime,\nand opposition to the movement grew even stronger. Finally, with the\nurging of middle-class Negroes, the government brought Garvey to trial\nfor using the mails to defraud. He insisted on being his own lawyer, and\nhe took great pleasure in harassing the witnesses and haranguing the\njury. When he realized that this was undermining his own case, he began\ntaking advice from a white lawyer. Nevertheless, he was fined $1,000 and\ngiven a sentence of up to five years in prison. In 1925, he was sent to\nthe Atlanta Penitentiary. At that point, many of his opponents had second\nthoughts about his case and asked the government to reopen it.  President\nCoolidge commuted the sentence, but as soon as he was released Garvey was\nagain arrested and was deported as an undesirable alien.\n\nAs the movement had been largely dependent on Garvey's magnetic\npersonality, the organization began to dissolve as soon as he left the\ncountry. Garvey tried to establish a worldwide movement with its base in\nJamaica, but a power fight for control with the New York leadership\ndeveloped. The outbreak of the Second World War further diminished the\ninfluence of his organization. Garvey died in London in June, 1940.\n\nBoth James Weldon Johnson and W. E. B. DuBois claimed that emigration of\nblacks from America to Africa was merely a form of escapism.  (Ironically\nDuBois's disillusionment drove him to Africa some thirty years later. )\nJohnson argued that a small independent African nation would have to be\ndependent on Europe and America for capital. Therefore Garvey's program\ncould not achieve the kind of freedom and equality which it claimed.\nJohnson maintained that it would still be subject to oppression from\nwhite imperialism. As such, the nation would only be an underdeveloped\narea dependent on external financing and continually subjected to\neconomic exploitation. In foreign affairs it would always be small and\nweak, and it would have to depend on some stronger ally for its defense.\nIt would only become a pawn for the great powers, all of which were white\nEuropeans or Americans. Johnson claimed that a separate African nation\nwould not provide the kind of power base which Garvey promised.\n\nAlthough Garvey had, overnight, created the largest mass organization in\nAfro-American history, it crumbled almost as quickly as it had been\nbuilt. The movement had been overly dependent on his personality.\nHowever, Garvey cannot be dismissed so easily. Although his movement\ndisintegrated rapidly, the interest in black identity and black pride\nwhich he had sparked, lingered on. Lacking a structure within which to\noperate, it was not very obvious to the external observer.  Nevertheless,\nhis ideas have clearly provided the spawning ground from which more\nrecent organizations have developed.\n\n\nA. Philip Randolph: The Trumpet of Mobilization\n\nThe leadership style of A. Philip Randolph differed from that of\nWashington, DuBois, and Garvey. His interest in providing jobs and skills\nfor the working class was akin to that of Washington.  His aggressive\noutspoken manner was more like that of DuBois.  While lacking the\nflamboyant style of Garvey, he was able to work among the ranks of the\nworking class and gain their acceptance. He, too, has demonstrated\nconsiderable ability in mass organization. Like DuBois, he wanted to use\nblack solidarity as a wedge with which to break through discrimination\ninto a biracial society and not as an end in itself.\n\nAsa Philip Randolph was born in Crescent City, Florida, in 1889.  He was\nraised in a strict religious home. His father was a local minister but he\nalso had to hold down another full-time job in order to support his\nfamily. Early in the century, Randolph moved north and attended City\nCollege in New York.  During the First World War, Randolph, with Chandler\nOwen, edited The Messenger and made it into an outspoken vehicle for\ntheir own opinions. In its pages, they espoused a radical, American brand\nof democratic socialism. They supported the International Workers of the\nWorld, which many viewed as being alien and communistic, and they\nquestioned the advisability of Negroes supporting the war effort. They\nwere charged with undermining the national defense, and they spent some\ntime in Jail. Both advocated a working-class solidarity of blacks and\nwhites which would resist exploitation by capitalism. In their view,\nevery nonunion man, black or white, was a potential scab and a potential\nthreat to every union man, black or white. While the white and black dogs\nwere fighting over the bone, they pointed out, the yellow capitalist dog\nran off with it. The Messenger encouraged blacks to join unions, and it\ntried hard to persuade the unions to eliminate discrimination. The view\nthey propagated was that unions could not afford to be based on the color\nline; instead they should be based on a class line.\n\nRandolph and Owen attacked Samuel Gompers and the A. F. of L. for failing\nto be truly biracial.  Randolph criticized DuBois and the N.A.A.C.P. for\ntheir lack of concern with the real day-to-day problems of the masses. He\ncharged that the N.A.A.C.P. was led by people who were neither blacks nor\nworkers, and that they were incapable, therefore, of articulating the\nneeds of the masses. He argued that an organization for the welfare of\nthe Irish would never be led by Jews.  Therefore, he suggested that an\norganization for the welfare of Blacks should not be led by whites. He\nwas especially critical of the gradualist, peaceful policy which DuBois\nappeared to support during the early years of the N.A.A.C.P. He\nquestioned DuBois's professed stand against violence and revolution.\n\nRandolph said: \"Doubtless DuBois is the only alleged leader of an\noppressed group of people in the world today who condemns revolution.\" To\nRandolph, violence and revolution were not anti-American, but were\njustified by the Declaration of Independence.\n\nDuring the twenties, Randolph tried several schemes to increase black and\nwhite cooperation in unions. Along with Chandler Owen, he founded the\nNational Association for the Promotion of Unionism among Negroes.  The\nmost successful of Randolph's efforts came in 1925 when he established\nthe Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. The Brotherhood appeared to\ndemonstrate the futility of his basic thesis. Randolph, who believed in\nbiracial unionism, had established, in the Brotherhood, an organization\nwhich, by the nature of the occupation, was to be an exclusively black\nunion. He found himself being pushed relentlessly away from biracial\nunionism into supporting racial organizations for racial advancements.\n\nIn 1936, he played a key role in forming the National Negro Congress.  It\nwas a broad alliance of all kinds of groups to advance the welfare of the\nrace. Although it did not receive the backing of the N.A.A.C.P., the\nUrban League, an even more conservative organization, became a\ncornerstone in the Congress.  The Urban League has always been primarily\ninterested in securing employment for the Negro working class. During the\nthirties, the communists adopted a united-front policy, and they tried to\ninfiltrate the N.N.C. Some of the left-wing unions which did support the\nN.N.C., were largely white.\n\nRandolph's talent for mass mobilization was demonstrated most clearly in\nhis efforts to organize two gigantic marches on Washington in order to\ndramatize Afro-American needs and to pressure the government into action.\nAs American industry began to gear up for war production at the beginning\nof the Second World War, it needed to find new sources of labor. The\nAfro-American community was eager to support the war effort, particularly\nbecause it meant fighting Hitler's racism.  But they were also eager to\nfind jobs. However, defense industries in America continued to display\ntheir own brand of racial discrimination. Many of them said quite openly\nthat, while they were willing to hire blacks, they would only give them\nmenial positions regardless of their skill and training. It became clear\nthat racism had to be fought at home and abroad.\n\nMany tried to get the government to take action, but it seemed more\nconcerned with protecting its political image and with avoiding\nalienating the party's financial backers.  In January, 1941, Randolph\nsuggested a mass march on Washington to demand government action against\ndiscrimination both in government services and in defense industry. The\nidea took root, and a mass march was being organized for July. On June\n25, 1941, President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 which forbade\nfurther discrimination either in government services or defense\nindustries, on the grounds of race, creed, or nationality.  While some\ndiscrimination still continued, the order and the Fair Employment\nPractices Commission, which resulted from it, played an important role in\nopening large numbers of new jobs to the Afro-American community. The\nplanned march, which will be discussed more fully in a later chapter, was\nthen called off. Although the march was canceled, Randolph hoped to keep\nthe March on Washington Movement alive. He wanted to create a permanent\nmobilized community. This, too, failed to materialize, but, if it had not\nbeen for the war, his efforts might have been more successful. In\nSeptember, 1942, Randolph called a meeting of the March on Washington\nMovement before which he outlined his program. He told the conference\nthat slavery had not ended because it was evil, but because it was\nviolently overthrown, Similarly, he said that if they wanted to obtain\ntheir rights, they would have to be willing to fight, go to jail, and die\nfor them. Rights would not be granted; they must be taken if need be. His\nplan was to organize a permanent mass movement on a nationwide basis and\nto conduct protests, marches, and boycotts. This was an adaptation of\nsome of Gandhi's techniques to the Afro-American problem.\n\nThe March on Washington Movement was to be an all-Negro movement. Yet,\nRandolph did not intend it to be anti-white. He pointed to the fact that\nevery organization must have its own purposes, that Catholic groups\nconcentrated on their interests in the same way as labor groups strove to\ngain their objectives. Any oppressed people must assume the major\nresponsibility for furthering their goals. They might accept help and\ncooperation from outside, but they must, in the final analysis, rely on\nself-organization and self-help. One of the by-products of this, Randolph\nbelieved, would be the development of self-reliance within the\nAfro-American community and the destruction of the slave mentality.\nAlthough individual blacks within the community could join other\norganizations, and while the movement itself might cooperate with other\norganizations, the March on Washington Movement itself was to be\nexclusively for blacks. It was a racial movement for racial advancement.\n\nRandolph went on to envision an organization with a challenging action\nprogram. Millions of supporters would be divided into a network of small\nblock units. Each would be headed by a block captain. This would\nfacilitate instant, mass mobilization. At a moment's notice, a chain of\ncommand could be activated, and millions of marchers would be in the\nstreets. Randolph also envisioned repeated, gigantic marches aimed at\nWashington and state capitals. He could also see smaller, regular marches\non the city halls and other establishments in dozens of cities across the\ncountry. To him it was desirable for blacks to picket the White House, if\nneed be, until the nation came to see that blacks were willing to\nsacrifice everything to be counted as men.  Randolph also wanted to\nencourage the mobilization of registration and voting.\n\nBesides being reminiscent of the Gandhi nonviolent campaign in India,\nRandolph's March on Washington Movement, although it never materialized,\nforeshadowed the civil rights movement of the late fifties and sixties.\nThis later civil rights movement, however, was directed by several\nseparate organizations which, at times, were involved in power fights\nwith one another. It lacked the central organization and national,\ninstant mobilization which Randolph had in mind. It also included a\nsubstantial number of white supporters and leaders which Randolph had\nexcluded from his program. He had predicted that this kind of white\nparticipation would back down in times of crisis and thereby emasculate\nthe movement. This is precisely what the Black Power advocates of the\nlate sixties claimed had happened to the civil rights movement, and they\ngave the same reasons for its collapse.\n\nIn 1947, Randolph cooperated with Grant Reynolds in organizing the League\nfor Non-Violent Civil Disobedience Against Military Segregation; its aim\nwas to encourage draft resisters objecting to serving in a segregated\narmy. Randolph was also one of a delegation which told President Truman\nthat America could not afford to fight colored people in Asia with the\narmy as it then existed. Truman, then, took the first real steps in\nending military segregation. In 1963, Randolph and Bayard Rustin did\norganize a massive march on Washington. Most of the publicity, however,\nwent to Martin Luther King, Jr., its main speaker.  This march\ncontributed significantly to the passage of civil rights legislation.\nHowever, most of Randolph's efforts continued to be in the realm of union\norganization. In 1957, he was made a vice president in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\nand a member of its executive council. Two years later, he was censured\nfor charging organized labor with racism.\n\nAlthough Randolph was not able to achieve his dream of mass mobilization,\nhe did display considerable organizational ability.  In part, his ideas\nhave been put into effect by subsequent groups, and his philosophy was\nsimilar to that which became popular in the 1960s. The whole civil rights\nmovement bore a marked resemblance to his philosophy, and undoubtedly it\ndrew considerable motivation from it.  The idea of an all-black mass\norganization, with a vast network of local action groups participating in\nit, is still alive. He had envisioned a grass-roots black power movement\na quarter of a century before it became popular. Although dozens of such\ngroups have sprung up across the country, they still lack the kind of\nmass mobilization and national coordination which he had planned. His was\nto have been a militant, all-black movement without its becoming\nanti-white. It was to teach self-reliance to the Afro-American community.\nLocal control and power were to be used to achieve freedom and civil\nrights within a genuinely biracial society.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nThe New Negro\n\n\nImmigration and Migration\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, the American racial dilemma had appeared\nto be a regional problem. The Northern states had abolished slavery early\nin the century, and the abolitionists self-righteously condemned Southern\nslaveholders while remaining unaware of their own racism.  However, the\ntwentieth century showed that racism was really a national issue.\nThousands of Afro-Americans moved from the rural South into the urban\nNorth, creating a more even distribution of that population throughout\nthe country. At the same time, there was a fresh wave of voluntary\nimmigration into America by peoples with an African heritage.  Most of\nthese newcomers also moved into Northern cities. As thousands of blacks\nspread into the North and West, the inhabitants there developed\nsympathies with Southern racists.  Actually, this population shift only\nunearthed attitudes which had been there all the time. This gigantic\nmigration of peoples was symptomatic of the change in the heart of the\nblack community. It signaled a new dynamism and a new aggressiveness.\n\nThe voluntary black immigration which occurred during the twentieth\ncentury was a new and unusual phenomenon. Almost all blacks who had\npreviously come to America had been brought in chains. Those who came\nvoluntarily during this century came in spite of their knowledge that\nracism would confront them. Their awareness of American racism, however,\nwas an abstraction and was only partially understood by them.\nNevertheless, they saw America as the land of prosperity and opportunity\nat a time when, for many of them, social and economic conditions in their\nhomeland did not seem promising. While only a few came from Africa\nitself, except as students staying for a limited period, there was a\nswelling flow from the West Indies and the entire Caribbean area.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1920s, the United States imposed a new quota\nsystem on new immigrants and this drastically slowed the influx of people\nfrom South and East  Europe. In spite of the racist and ethnic overtones\nof this legislation, it failed to build significant barriers to movement\nby blacks within the western hemisphere. During the 1920s large numbers\nof blacks came to the United States from other parts of the Americas. By\n1930 eighty-six percent of the foreign-born Negroes living in the United\nStates were born in some other country in this hemisphere.  By far the\nlargest number of  these, seventy-three percent, came from the West\nIndies and most of them were from the British West Indies.\n\nBy 1940, there were some eighty-four thousand foreign-born Negroes living\nin  the country. As large as this total might appear, still less than one\npercent of the twelve million Negroes were recorded in the 1940 census.\nMost of these new immigrants went to live in large cities in the\nNortheast, with by far the majority being concentrated in New York City\nitself. At the point when the influx was at its highest, in 1930,\nseventeen percent of the Negroes in New York City were foreign born.\n\nAn unusually high percentage of these newcomers had held white-collar\noccupations--mostly young professionals with little hope of advancement\nin the static economy of the Islands. Although they were aware of the\nAmerican racial situation, they were still unprepared to cope with it.\nMost of them were accustomed to being part of the majority in their\nhomeland. They had experienced discrimination before, but it had not been\nas uncompromising as what they found on arrival in America. Society, as\nthey knew it, was divided into whites, mulattoes, and blacks instead of\ninto black and white.  Many mulattoes were not psychologically ready for\nthe experience of being lumped in with the Blacks. Moreover, the racism\nthey knew had been modified by an economic class system which left some\nof the poor whites with less status than that of professional blacks.\nComing to America, for them, meant a loss of status although it might\nalso mean an increase in affluence.\n\nJames Weldon Johnson described the West Indian immigrants as being almost\ntotally different from the Southern rural Negroes who had moved into New\nYork City. He said that the West Indians displayed a high intelligence,\nmany having an English common-school education, and he noted that there\nwas almost no illiteracy among them. He also said that they were\nsober-minded and had a genius for business enterprise. It has been\nestimated that one-third of the city's Negro professionals, physicians,\ndentists, and lawyers, were foreign born.\n\nThe West Indians had an ethos which stressed saving, education, and hard\nwork. The same self-confidence and initiative which enabled substantial\nnumbers of them to move into professional employment made others into\npolitical radicals. Unaccustomed to the intensity of racial hostility and\nharassment which they found in America, they reacted with anger. They had\nnot been trained since birth in attitudes of submission and\nnonresistance. This was the phenomenon which created Marcus Garvey and\nthe United Negro Improvement Association. The West Indian community had\nbeen gradually merging with the larger Afro-American society. It never\nestablished a separate place of residence, and the second generation\nbecame mixed with the larger Afro-American community.  After the Second\nWorld War, there was a fresh wave of emigration from the West Indies to\nAmerica, but the 1952 Immigration Act drastically reduced the West Indian\nquota, thereby 'deflecting this stream of emigrants to Britain.\n\nIn contrast, the Spanish-speaking immigrants from the Caribbean did\nestablish separate communities. After the United States acquired Puerto\nRico, a sizeable number of Puerto Ricans moved to the mainland. This flow\nbegan as a trickle at the beginning of the century, and it has grown\nrapidly since. Most of the Puerto Ricans settled in urban centers in the\nNortheast, and they established a large, Spanish-speaking community in\nNew York City.  The migration of Cubans into America, while not as large,\nhas been important in both Miami and New York. The largest number of\nCubans came during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn 1910, the Puerto Rican community in New York City numbered only five\nhundred, but by 1920 it had grown to seven thousand.  In 1940, the number\nof New York residents who had been born in Puerto Rico reached seventy\nthousand, and in 1950, it jumped to one hundred eighty seven thousand.\nThe 1960 census showed that the Puerto Rican community of New York City,\nincluding those born in Puerto Rico as well as those born in America of\nPuerto Rican parentage, had reached 613,000.\n\nThe Spaniards in Latin America had intermarried with both the Indians and\nAfricans to a far higher degree than had the Anglo-Saxons in North\nAmerica. For this reason, it is much more difficult to identify the\nracial background of individual Puerto Ricans. Certainly, there was a\nsignificant African influence on the entire population of the island.  In\n1860, it was estimated that almost 50 percent of the island's residents\nwere Negro. In 1900, the percentage had dropped to 40 percent, and, by\n1950, it had dropped to 20 percent. The change in these statistics was\ndue to assimilation through intermarriage. Those who migrated to the\ncontinent did not include many with dominant negroid characteristics. The\n1960 New York City census listed only 4 percent of its Puerto Ricans as\nbeing Negro. Nathan Glazer and Daniel P. Moynihan, in their study of this\ncommunity, believed that the Puerto Rican racial attitudes may alter the\nracial views of the entire city and thereby have some effect on the\nnation.  Puerto Ricans are not as race conscious as are most Americans.\nMost of them are not clearly either black or white. Intermarriage between\ncolor groups is common.  The Puerto Rican community in New York City is\nmore conscious of being a separate, Spanish-speaking community than it is\nof being either a black or white one.\n\nThe other major Caribbean element in the American Spanish-speaking\ncommunity comes from Cuba. In 1960, the Cuban community in the United\nStates, including those born in Cuba as well as those born in America of\nCuban parentage, totaled 124,416. Only 6.5 percent of this community is\nnonwhite, while 25 percent of the population in Cuba is nonwhite.  The\nCuban community in the United States has almost 46 percent of its number\nliving in the Northeast, and it has another 43 percent living in Florida.\nAlmost the entire community is divided between the cities of Miami and\nNew York.\n\nThis immigration of foreign-born blacks into the cities of the North\nand West was concurrent with a sizeable movement of American blacks\nfrom the rural South into these same cities.  Actually, this internal\nmigration was not new. As soon as the Northern states had begun to\nabolish slavery, runaways from the slave states in the South began to\ntrickle into the North. As the underground Railway developed, this\ntrickle swelled into a sizeable flow.\n\nImmediately after the Civil War, the flow reversed directions\nfor a short time. Many who had run away during the war returned home to\nbe with friends and family. Thousands of others, born in the North,\nhurried south to help educate and rehabilitate their brothers. However,\nthis flow was short-lived. As the South moved from slavery into\nsegregation, hope slid into disillusionment and cynicism. In 1878-79\nthere was a wave of migration from the south into the West. \"Pap\"\nSingleton, an ex-slave from Tennessee, had come to the conclusion that\nthe ex-slaveholder and the ex-slave could not live together in harmony,\nand he believed that the best solution was to develop a separate society.\nAs a result, he formed the Tennessee Real Estate and Homestead\nAssociation, but there was not enough land available in Tennessee for the\nprogram. Finally, he decided that Kansas was the ideal location in which\nto build a separate Negro society. Various transportation companies saw\nthis scheme as a way for them to make money, and they encouraged this\nwestward migration.  Although the original migrants to Kansas were\nwelcomed, opposition grew as their numbers increased.  Before his death\nin 1892, Singleton became disillusioned with the possibilities of\ndeveloping a separate society anywhere in the United States, and he came\nto favor a return to Africa.  He believed that this was the only place\nwhere his people could escape racial discrimination.  Nevertheless,\nSingleton took pride in his work, and he claimed, probably with some\nexaggeration, to have been responsible for transporting some 82,000\nAfro-Americans from the South into  Kansas.\n\nAnother ex-slave, Henry Adams, called a New Orleans Colored Convention in\n1879 to examine the condition of the ex-slave throughout the South.  A\ncomittee was formed for this purpose. It found the situation discouraging\nand recommended migration into other regions. Another convention held in\nNashville reached similar conclusions, and it requested funds from\nCongress to assist in the process. Funds were not forthcoming. When\nCongress did investigate this vast migration, Southerners assured the\ncomittee that their Negroes were really very happy, and they claimed that\n\"the migration was a myth.\"\n\nIn spite of this earlier migration, the 1900 census showed that 89.7\npercent of the Afro-American community still resided in the South.\nOne-third of the Southern population was nonwhite. The real exodus still\nlay ahead.\n\nThe migrants were moved both by forces within the South which pushed them\nout and by those within the  North which pulled them in. On one hand,\ncontinuing violence and segregation drove many to leave their homes. When\nthe boll weevil spread across the Southern states like a plague, it wiped\nout many poor farmers, and it drove them to seek other means of\nlivelihood elsewhere. On the other hand, the war had interrupted the flow\nof immigrants from Europe into the Northern industrial centers, and at\nthe same time it created the need for even more unskilled labor in the\nfactories.  After the war, the restrictive immigration laws which were\npassed kept the flow of European immigration low, and Northern industry\ncontinued to draw labor from the Southern rural pockets of poverty.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1920, some 330,000 Afro-Americans moved from the South\ninto the North and West. By 1940, the number of those who had left the\nSouth since 1910 had soared to 1,750,000.  Between 1940 and 1950, there\nwere another 1,597,000, and between 1950 and 1960, there were 1,457,000\nmore who left the South. The percentage of the Afro-American community\nliving still in the South had dropped from 89.7 percent in 1900 to 59\npercent and for the first time, more than half of them lived outside of\nthe Deep South.\n\nAnother indication of the northward migration which had occured was that\na Northern state, New York, had acquired an Afro-American community which\nwas larger than that of any of the Southern states.  Much of this\nmigration was also a move from the country to the city. In the South, 58\npercent of the Afro-Americans lived in cities. In the West, there are 93\npercent who live in the cities, and in the North, there are 96 percent.\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, the Afro-American community\nhad been transformed from a rural and regional group into a national one.\n\n\nHarlem: \"The Promised Land\"\n\nAlain Locke edited a volume of critical essays and literature entitled\nThe New Negro. In it, Locke heralded a spiritual awakening within the\nAfro-American community. It was manifested by a creative outburst of art,\nmusic and  literature as well as by a new mood of self-confidence and\nself-consciousness within that community. The center of this explosion\nwas located in Harlem. Famous personalities such as Claude McKay,\nLangston Hughes, Paul Robeson, James Weldon Johnson, Duke Ellington, and\nLouis Armstrong either moved to Harlem or visited it frequently in order\nto participate in the vigorous cultural exchange which took place there.\nThe artists of the \"Negro Renaissance\", as important as they might be\nthemselves, were merely symbolic of the new life which was electrifying\nthe Afro-American community.  This new life was also evident in the large\nurban centers of the North and particularly in Harlem.\n\nLocke pointed out the significance of the great northward migration when\nhe said that the Negro \"in the very process of being transplanted,\" was\nalso being \"transformed.\" This migration was usually explained either in\neconomic terms--jobs pulling Negroes northward--or in social\nterms--discrimination pushing them out. In both cases, the Afro-American\nwas represented as the passive victim of external socioeconomic forces.\nLocke insisted that, to the contrary, it was more accurate to understand\nthis migration as a result of a decision made by the Negro himself.  For\nthe first time in history, thousands upon thousands of individual\nAfro-Americans had made a basic choice concerning their own existence.\nThey refused to remain victims of an impersonal and oppressive system,\nand, as the result, they deliberately pulled up their roots, left their\nfriends and neighbors and moved north to what they hoped would be \"the\npromised land.\"\n\nFrom this decision emerged the new Negro. If he was less polite and more\naggressive than before, he was also more self-reliant and less dependent\non pity and charity. This change, however, did not occur suddenly. The\npassive, well-behaved Negro, content to stay in his place, had largely\nbeen a myth. In part, he, had been the product of a guilt-ridden white\nstereotype which found this myth comforting. The Negro himself had also\ncontributed to this fiction by his custom of social mimicry, his habit of\nappearing to fill the role which whites expected of him. By the end of\nslavery, however, a spirit of individuality had been growing within the\nNegro consciousness. The opportunity for industrial employment in the\nNorth which had resulted from war and from the slowdown in European\nimmigration along with the increase of racism and segregation in the\nSouth combined to open the way for the development of the growing spirit\nof determination.\n\nThe new Negro was doing more than asserting his own individuality; the\nentire Afro-American community was developing a new sense of solidarity.\nThe racist attitudes of mainstream America, both North and South, made\nit almost impossible for a Negro to conceive of himself purely in\nindividualistic terms. Any Negro who thought of himself as an exceptional\nor unique individual was brought sharply back to reality by this racism\nwhich relentlessly and mercilessly depicted him as nothing more than a\n\"nigger.\"\n\nIn spite of the individualism which was preached as a basic part\nof the American creed, the Afro-American community was forced to develop\na strong sense of group cooperation. In the face of growing racism and\nsegregation, the idealism of the new Negro was still based on the\nAmerican ideal of democracy, and his goal was still to share fully, some\nday, in American life and institutions.  The Afro-American's heightened\nsense of racial consciousness was not an end in itself. This racial\nself-consciousness gave him strength to withstand the daily injustices\nwhich confronted  him, and it provided him with faith in himself and hope\nin the future.  Locke believed that the new Negro was taking the racism\nwhich had been forced upon him by white society and was turning it to\npositive uses, transforming obstacles to his progress into \"dams of\nsocial energy and power.\"\n\nThe factor which prevented this new, energetic Afro-American from\nbecoming alienated from America was that its goals were identical with\nthe expressed ideals of the country. The racial discrimination and\ninjustice from which Afro-Americans suffered, though deeply entrenched in\nnational institutions, were themselves a contradiction to the American\ndemocratic philosophy. The Afro-American, besides having justice on his\nside, was comforted knowing that his goals were sanctioned and hallowed\nby the nation's ideals. As Locke put it, \"We cannot be undone without\nAmerica's undoing\".\n\nThousands of Negro migrants poured north into Chicago. The factories in\nDetroit attracted thousands more, and Harlem became the center of \"the\npromised land.\" James Johnson described the Harlem of the 1920s as the\n\"culture capitol of the Negro world.\" Its magnetism attracted Negroes\nfrom all across America, from the West Indies and even some from Africa\nitself. Harlem contained more Negroes per square  mile than any other\nplace on earth. It drew a bewildering and energizing diversity of\npeoples.  Students, peasants, artists, businessmen, professional men,\npoets, musicians, and workers; all came to Harlem. It combined both the\nexploiters and the outcasts. Langston Hughes, in describing his first\nentrance into Harlem from the 135th Street subway exit, said that he felt\nvitality and hope throbbing in the air. In Black Manhattan, James Weldon\nJohnson said that Harlem was not a slum or a fringe. Rather, he insisted\nthat it was one of the \"most beautiful and healthful sections of the\ncity.\"\n\nAccording to Johnson, the stranger traveling through Harlem would be\ntotally surprised by its appearance. Crossing 125th Street on his way up\nSeventh Avenue, Johnson said, the visitor would not expect to find\nhimself in the midst of an Afro-American community.  The character of the\nhouses did not change. For the next twenty-five blocks the streets,\nstores, and buildings looked no different from those he had already\npassed. With the exception of their color, the appearance of the people\non the streets was the same too. Moreover, Johnson insisted that Harlem\nwas an integral part of metropolitan New York and was not just a quarter\nwithin the city in the sense that was true of the communities inhabited\nby recent European immigrants. Its citizens were not aliens.  They spoke\nAmerican; they thought American.\n\nHarlem Negroes, claimed Johnson, were woven into the fabric of the\nmetropolitan economy. Unlike the Negroes in other Northern cities, they\ndid not work in \"gang labor\"; rather, they had individual employment here\nand there scattered throughout the city. He believed that this\nintegration into the society as a whole made a difference in the kind of\nrace relations which existed there, and he said that it explained why New\nYork had not had a major race riot in the \"bloody summer\" of 1919. He\ncontended that Harlem was a laboratory for the race problem.  Many had\nargued that when Negroes moved north, the race problem would follow them.\nJohnson pointed out that 175,000 Negroes had recently moved into Harlem\nwithout any substantial racial friction and with no unusual increase in\nthe crime rate.  Unfortunately, Johnson's views were not to be fulfilled.\nBefore long, crime rates rose in Harlem, and race riots occurred there as\nwell as in other parts of New York City.\n\nJohnson was aware that there had been considerable racial tension at\nearlier dates as Negroes first moved into Harlem. The community had been,\nin turn, Dutch, Irish, Jewish, and Italian.  Originally Negroes, living\nin New York, worked for wealthy Whites and lived in the shadows of the\nlarge mansions surrounding Washington Square. Several of the streets in\nGreenwich Village had been almost entirely inhabited by Negroes. About\n1890, the community shifted its focus northward into the 20's and low\n30's just west of Sixth Avenue. At the turn of the century, it moved\nagain into the vicinity of 53rd Street. By this time, the city's\nAfro-American community was developing a small middle class of its own,\nand it contained its own fashionable clubs and night life.  Visiting\nNegro entertainers from across the country usually performed at and\nresided in the Marshall Hotel. The \"Memphis Students\", probably the first\nprofessional jazz band to tour the country, played at the Marshall.\nShortly after 1900, Negroes began to move to Harlem.\n\nHarlem had been overbuilt with large apartments which the owners were\nunable to fill. The Lenox Avenue subway had not yet been built, and there\nwas inadequate transportation into the area. As a result, most tenants\npreferred to live elsewhere. Philip A.  Payton, a Negro real estate\nagent, told several of the owners, located on the east side of the\ndistrict, that he could guarantee to provide them with regular tenants if\nthey were willing to accept Negroes. Some of the landlords on East 134th\nStreet accepted his offer, and he filled their buildings with Negro\ntenants.\n\nAt first, whites did not notice. However, when Negroes spread west of\nLenox Avenue, white resistance stiffened. The local residents formed a\ncorporation to purchase the buildings inhabited by Negroes and to evict\nthem. In turn, the Negroes responded by forming the Afro-American Realty\nCompany, and they too bought out apartment buildings, evicted the white\ntenants, and rented the apartments to Negroes. White residents then put\npressure on lending institutions not to provide mortgages to prospective\nNegro buyers. When one was  able to buy a piece of property, regardless\nof how prosperous or orderly he might appear, local whites viewed it as\nan invasion, panicked, and moved out in droves. This left the banks,\nstill unwilling to sell to Negroes, holding a large number of deserted\nproperties.  Eventually, they were compelled to sell these properties at\ndeflated prices. During and immediately after the First World War,\nNegroes poured into Harlem, obtained high-paying jobs, and purchased\ntheir own real estate. Johnson believed that Harlem Negroes owned at\nleast sixty million dollars worth of property, and this, he believed,\nwould prevent the neighborhood from \"degenerating into a slum.\"\n\nHowever, the great migration from the rural South had only just begun.\nAs thousands upon thousands more poured into Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee,\nNewark, Boston, Harlem, and other Northern centers, housing became\nincreasingly scarce. Harlem, like the other Negro communities of the\nNorth, became more and more crowded.  At the same time, jobs became\nharder to obtain. Poor \"country cousins\" streamed into \"the promised\nland\" to share in the \"milk and honey,\" but, unfortunately, there was not\nenough to go around. As the Negro population of Harlem grew, white\nresistance and discrimination also increased. Although Johnson had been\nimpressed with the wealth contained in Harlem, it was infinitesimal\ncompared to the great sums of money held by whites downtown.\n\nLangston Hughes, who had also been impressed by the vitality of Harlem,\ncame to realize that Negro Harlem was, in fact, dependent on downtown\nfinancing. As Harlem grew, downtown financiers became increasingly aware\nthat money could be made there. In the 1930s, in contrast to Johnson's\noptimistic vision, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. and others pointed out that\nalmost all the stores on 125th Street, the major shopping district, were\nowned by whites and that they employed whites almost exclusively. Harlem\nsoon became a center for both crime and exploitation.\n\nHowever, in the 1920s Harlem throbbed with vitality and hope.  Besides\nattracting Afro-Americans from every walk of life, it became the focal\npoint for young intellectuals whose creativity resulted in the Negro\nRenaissance.\n\n\nThe Negro Renaissance\n\nIn 1922, James Welden Johnson edited a volume of American Negro poetry,\nand in the same year Claude McKay, who had come to Harlem from Jamaica,\npublished his first significant volume of poetry, \"Harlem Shadows\".\nThese twin events, however, were only the beginning of a vast outpouring\nof cultural activity, and Harlem became, as Johnson called it, the\n\"culture capital\" for this movement. Artists poured into Harlem from\nacross the country.  Night clubs rocked with music and dance.  Publishers\nwere besieged by poets and novelists, and, surprising  to the young\nwriters, publishers were eager to see Negro authors.  Besides the new\ncreative urge, thousands of Negroes and whites were hungry to consume the\nfruits of this new renaissance. This artistic renaissance did not come\nout of a vacuum. Negroes had been publishing poetry for over a century\nand a half, since the time of Phillis Wheatley and Jupiter Hammon. Paul\nLaurence Dunbar was the first Negro poet to gain nationwide recognition,\nat the beginning of the twentieth century.  While, on one hand, he\ncaptured and depicted the spirit of the Negro folk, on the other hand, he\ndid it in such a way as to perpetuate black stereotypes and white\nprejudices. Actually, this aided his popularity, and he later came to\nregret it.\n\nNegroes had also been dancing and creating music in America for over\nthree gundred years. Vaudeville and minstrelsy were their first\ncommercial products. Ironically, the first professional entertainers to\nperform in minstrel shows were whites who were imitating plantation slave\nproductions. In the beginning, whites performed in blackface, and, only\nlater, did Negroes themselves perform commercially. The spirituals were a\nreligious manifestation of the Afro-American heritage. They appear to\nhave been on the verge of disappearing when the \"Fisk University\nSingers\", late in the nineteenth century, took steps to preserve them. A\nchoral group from Fisk was touring the country in order to raise money\nfor the school. They received only polite appreciation. When, on one\noccasion, they decided to offer one of their spirituals as an encore, the\naudience was enthusiastic.  Since then, spirituals have become a standard\npart of American religious and concert music.\n\nIn short, even before the Negro Renaissance of the 1920s the\nAfro-American community had made a basic contribution to American\nculture, providing America with a peasant folk tradition of the greatest\nimportance. The social mobility in the American scene had permitted each\nwave of European immigrants to move up the social ladder before it had\ntime to develop into an American peasant class. However, this mobility\nwas not extended to the Afro-American. Therefore, it was from the\nAfro-American peasant class that an indigenous American folk culture was\nto emerge.  When minstrelsy and jazz spread around the world, they were\nseen as American productions. They were, at the same time, Afro-American\ncreations.\n\nThe Afro-American folk culture must be seen as the product of the\nAfrican's experience in America rather than as an importation into\nAmerica of foreign, African elements. Although the content of the\nAfro-American folk culture grew out of the American scene, its style and\nflavor did have African roots. It was based on the artistic sense which\nthe slave brought with him--a highly developed sense of rhythm which was\npassed from generation to generation, and an understanding of art which\nconceived of it as an integral part of the whole of life rather than as a\nbeautiful object set apart from mundane experience.  Song and dance, for\nexample, were involved in the African's daily experience of work, play,\nlove, and worship. In sculpture, painting and pottery, the African used\nhis art to decorate the objects of  his daily life rather than to make\nart objects for their own sake. The African could not have imagined going\nto an art gallery or to a musical concert. Art was produced by artisans\nrather than by artists.  This meant that slave artisans in America could\ncontinue to produce decorative work, and slave laborers in the field\ncould continue to sing. Art and life could still be combined, though in a\nrestricted manner.\n\nHowever, while the African brought his feeling for art with him, the\ncontent of his art was actually changed as the result of his American\nslave experience. The dominant African arts were sculpture,\nmetal-working, and weaving. In America, the Afro-American created song,\ndance, music, and, later, poetry.  The skills displayed in African art\nwere technical, rigid, control disciplined. They were characteristically\nsober, restrained and heavily conventionalized.\n\nIn contrast, the Afro-American cultural spirit became emotional,\nexuberant, and sentimental. This is to say the Afro-American\ncharacteristics which have been generally thought of as being African and\nprimitive--his naivety, his exuberance and his spontaneity--are, in\nreality, his response to his American experience and not a part of his\nAfrican heritage. They are to be understood as the African's emotional\nreaction to his American ordeal of slavery. Out of this environmental\nalong with its suffering and deprivation, has evolved an Afro-American\nculture.\n\nLeRoi Jones, the contemporary poet, playwright, and jazz critic, points\nout in \"Blues People\" that the earliest Negro contributions to formal art\ndid not reflect this genuine Afro-American culture.  It was only with the\nemergence of the \"New Negro\" and the Negro Renaissance that this folk\nculture entered the mainstream of the art world. Previously, those\nNegroes who had gained enough education to participate in literary\ncreation generally strove to join the American middle class, and tried to\ndisavow all connections with their lower class background.  In doing\nthis, they were only following the same route as that pursued by other\nethnic minorities in America. They were ashamed of slavery as well as of\neverything African.\n\nThe folk culture, nevertheless, flourished within the music produced by\nthe Afro-American community. The spirituals and work songs were the\nproduct of the slave. After Emancipation, work songs were replaced by the\nblues. Work songs had been  adapted to the mass labor techniques of\nslavery, whereas the blues, which is a solo form, was the creation of a\nlone individual working as a sharecropper on his own tenant farm. It\ncontinued to express the earthy folk culture, and it, too, was woven into\ndaily life. It expressed the daily tribulations, weariness, fears, and\nloves of the Afro-American after Emancipation. At the beginning of the\ntwentieth century, blues along with ragtime, became popular, although not\nalways respectable. They could be heard most often in saloons and\nbrothels--nevertheless, they were beginning to move out of the\nAfro-American subculture and into the white society.  W. C. Handy, while\nby no means the father of the blues, became its best-known commercial\ncreator. He is still remembered for the \"Memphis Blues\" and the \"St.\nLouis Blues.\"\n\nIn New Orleans, the folk tradition and formal music came together for the\nfirst time. There, the Latin tradition had permitted the Creoles to\nparticipate in education and culture. They had developed a rich musical\ntradition, and many of them had received training in French\nconservatories. However, they preferred the sophisticated European music\nto the more earthy sounds of their blacker brothers.  With the growth of\nJim Crow legislation, the Creoles lost their special position in society,\nand they found themselves forcibly grouped with the blacks, whom they had\npreviously shunned. Out of this fusion of technical musicianship and folk\ncreativity emerged a new, vigorous music which became known as jazz.\n\nJelly Roll Morton was one musician who had begun by studying classical\nguitar but preferred the music of the street. He became a famous jazz\npianist and singer. Over the years, he played his way from night spots in\nNew Orleans to those in St. Louis, Chicago, Los Angeles, and scores of\nsmaller cities. The musical quality of jazz, instead of adopting the pure\ntones of classical music, was boisterous and rasping. Instruments were\nmade to imitate the human voice, and they deliberately used a \"dirty\"\nsound.  Both the trumpet playing and singing of Louis Armstrong\nillustrate this jazz sound particularly well.  When Armstrong appeared in\nChicago with King Oliver as the band's second trumpeter, he was\nimmediately recognized as a jazz trumpet virtuoso, and his playing sent\nan electric shock through the jazz world.\n\nThe most famous jazz musician and composer to appear in New York City\nduring and after the Negro Renaissance was Duke Ellington. His well-known\ntheme song \"Take the A Train\" made reference to the subway line which\nwent to Harlem. By the time jazz had reached Harlem the Negro Renaissance\nwas in full swing. This renaissance, unlike previous art produced by\nNegroes, consciously built on the Afro-American folk tradition.\n\nLangston Hughes, the most prolific writer of the renaissance, wrote a\nkind of manifesto for the movement. He said that he was proud to be a\nblack artist. Further, he said that he was not writing to win the\napproval of white audiences. At the same time he claimed that he and the\nother young Negro artists were not attempting to gain the approval of\nblack audiences. They were writing to express their inner souls, and they\nwere not ashamed that those souls were black. If what they wrote pleased\neither whites or blacks, Hughes said, they were happy. It did not matter\nto them if it did not.\n\nIn \"Minstrel Man\", Hughes expressed the inner emotions of the\nstereotyped, well-behaved Negro which white America thought it knew so\nwell:\n\n  Because my mouth\n  Is wide with laughter\n  And my throat\n  Is deep with song,\n  You did not think\n  I suffer after\n  I've held my pain\n  So long.\n\n  Because my mouth\n  Is wide with laughter\n  You do not hear\n  My inner cry:\n  Because my feet\n  Are gay with dancing,\n  You do not know\n  I die.\n\nClaude McKay expresses an inner anger rather than a secret pain felt by a\ncontained and somewhat more sophisticated Negro responding to segregation:\n\n  Your door is shut against my tightened face,\n  And I am sharp as steel with discontent;\n  But I possess the courage and the grace\n  To bear my anger proudly and unbent.\n\nIn still more defiant tones, McKay expresses the aggressive response\nwhich many Negroes made during the race riots of 1919:\n\n  If we must die, let it not be like hogs\n  Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,\n  While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,\n  Making their mock at our accursed lot.\n\n  If we must die, O let us nobly die,\n  So that our precious blood may not be shed\n  In vain...\n\nNevertheless, Langston Hughes made it clear that his bitter hostility was\naimed at injustice and inhumanity and not at American ideals when he\nwrote:\n\n  O, yes,\n  I say it plain,\n  America never was America to me,\n  And yet I swear this oath--\n  America will be\n  An ever-living seed,\n  Its dream\n  Lies deep in the heart of me.\n\nBesides articulating the Negro's emotional reaction to prejudice and\ndiscrimination, the Negro Renaissance depicted other aspects of the\nAfro-American culture. The flavor of its religious life was captured best\nby James Weldon Johnson in his volume \"God's Trombones: Negro Sermons in\nVerse\", which he published in 1927. Instead of resorting to the standard\ntechnique of using stereotyped dialect to capture the flavor, Johnson\nused powerful, poetic imagery to express its essence.  In \"The Creation\"\nJohnson depicted a Negro minister preaching on the opening verses of\nGenesis:\n\n  And God stepped out on space,\n  And he looked around and said:\n  I'm lonely--\n  I'll make me a world.\n\n  And far as the eye of God could see\n  Darkness covered everything,\n  Blacker than a hundred midnights\n  Down in a cypress swamp.\n\n  Then God smiled,\n  And the light broke,\n  And the darkness rolled up on one side,\n  And the light stood shining on the other,\n  And God said: That's good!\n\nThe Negro Renaissance, besides losing its shame over its folk culture,\ndeveloped a fresh interest in its African heritage. One of the many\nexpressions of this was made by Countee Cullen:\n\n  What is Africa to me:\n  Copper sun or scarlet sea,\n  Jungle star or jungle track,\n  Strong bronzed men, or regal black\n  Women from whose loins I sprang\n  When the birds of Eden sang?\n\nThe Renaissance also included an outcropping of Negro novelists.  There\nhad been Negro novelists before, and the best known of them were Charles\nW. Chestnut and, to some extent, Paul Laurence Dunbar.  Chestnut's novels\nincluded \"The Conjure Woman\" and \"The Wife of His Youth and Other Stories\nof the Color Line\", whereas Dunbar, who wrote mainly poetry, was best\nknown for his novel \"The Sport of the Gods\".  Chestnut's writing, though\nmoving away from the plantation romanticism which had glorified slavery,\ndeveloped a more realistic flavor, and it emphasized intergroup relations\nbased on the color line rather than developing the interior lives of its\ncharacters. Negro fiction came into its own in 1923 with Jean Toomer's\npublication \"Cane\", and, in 1924, with Jessie Redman Fauset's \"There is\nConfusion\". These works dealt with Negroes as people and not merely as\nobjects to be manipulated for racial propaganda. Langston Hughes, in\n1930, published \"Not Without Laughter\", a novel to gain wide renown.\n\nTo catalog all the authors of the Negro Renaissance would become tedious.\nHowever, all the poets and novelists listed within these pages are\ngenerally accepted as having gained a place among America's significant\nwriters. They were more than products of an Afro-American subculture;\ntheir work became part of the mainstream of American literature. These\nauthors, along with other Negro artists, gained the respect of American\nart and literary critics. With them, the Afro-American folk culture made\nits way into the formal art of the nation.\n\nThe Negro Renaissance of the 1920s, however, was more than a literary\nmovement. There was, as had been noted earlier, a vast outpouring of\nmusical creativity. Besides the jazz composers and performers, many made\ntheir mark in classical concert music. The best known composer from the\nAfro-American community was William Grant Still. Many operatic and\nconcert singers have been Negroes, and they include such well-known names\nas Paul Robeson, Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, and William Warfield.\n\nThe most famous of the Afro-American painters was Henry O.  Tanner, who\nhad made his reputation before the Negro Renaissance.  Tanner's paintings\nhad been widely acclaimed at the Paris Exposition in 1900, the\nPan-American Exposition in 1901, and the St. Louis Exposition in 1904.\nTanner avoided Negro subjects and concentrated on biblical themes. In the\nfield of sculpture, Meta Warrick Fuller was the first Negro to gain\nattention. Augusta Savage became well-known for her head of Dr. DuBois,\nand Richmond Barthe gained recognition for the bust of Booker T.\nWashington.\n\nIn retrospect, the Renaissance of the twenties can be seen as the\nbeginning of a continuing, self-conscious cultural movement within the\nAfro-American community. During the 1930s, however, the outpouring\ndiminished. The Depression affected the entire American scene,\nbusinessmen, workmen, and artists, and its impact on the Negro\nRenaissance was particularly severe. One of the New Deal measures which\nalleviated the situation considerably was the Federal Writers Project.\nSterling Brown, literary critic and Howard University professor, headed\nthe Negro section. Two of the better known authors who were helped by the\nProject were Arna Bontemps and Richard Wright.\n\nWright's novel \"Native Son\" was widely acclaimed. In it, he depicted the\ninner anger and hatred felt by many young Negro men as dominating\ncharacteristics of the hero's personality; eventually, his life was\ndestroyed. The first Negro to win a Pulitzer Prize was Gwendolyn Brooks,\nwho won it for her poetry.  Later, Ralph Ellison was awarded a Pulitzer\nPrize for his novel \"Invisible Man\".\n\nSince the Second World War, innumerable Negroes have made significant\ncontributions to American culture through the mass media: radio,\ntelevision, and movies. Large numbers have also joined the ranks\nof professional athletes in every field from tennis to football.\nNevertheless, complaints persist that prejudice continues in these areas.\nWhile they are often included as performers, rarely do Negroes achieve\nsignificant decision-making authority in their field. In the 1968\nOlympics, several black athletes, especially Carlos and Smith, claimed\nthat instead of being accepted on an equal basis, they were being\nexploited.\n\nThe decade of the 1960s has been marked by a militant spirit throughout\nthe Afro-American community; this spirit was reminiscent of the new Negro\nof the 1920s although it appears to be more cynical and disillusioned.\nLeRoi Jones and James Baldwin are only the best known of dozens of\ncontemporary black writers.  Their bitterness, undoubtedly, springs\npartly from the dashed hopes of the new Negro.  Unfortunately, at the\nvery time that the Afro-American community was stepping forward with new\nconfidence, the nation was tottering on the brink of economic disaster.\nThe year 1929 brought a harsh end to the optimism of the 1920s.\n\n\nBlack Nationalism\n\nAlthough Langston Hughes had been confident that the American dream could\nbe made to include his people, thousands upon thousands of other\nAfro-Americans, especially among the lower classes, were extremely\ndubious. In 1916, Marcus Garvey came to Harlem, and before long his\nUniversal Negro Improvement Association had opened chapters in urban\ncenters all across the nation. As mentioned previously, Garvey did not\nbelieve that blacks could be taken into American society. Hundreds of\nthousands, who apparently agreed with him, followed his banner.  Whatever\nwas the actual number of members of the U.N.I.A., the movement gained\nmore grass-roots support than had any other organization in Afro-American\nhistory. While the nation was willing to tolerate the Afro-American folk\nspirit, the people, themselves, did not believe that they would be\naccepted.\n\nAlthough Garvey's movement was by far the largest black nationalist\norganization in America, it was not the only one. In Chicago, Grover\nCleveland Redding was preaching a Back-to-Africa philosophy of his own.\nHe organized the Abyssinian Movement and urged Negroes living on the\nsouth side of Chicago to return to Ethiopia. On Sunday, June 20, 1920,\nRedding led a parade through the Chicago streets. He sat astride a white\nhorse and wore what he claimed was the costume of an Abyssinian prince.\nAt the corner, of East 25th Street and Prairie Avenue he stopped the\nprocession, poured a flammable liquid on an American flag, and burned it.\nA Negro policeman, who attempted to break up the demonstration, was shot\nby one of Redding's followers. In the course of the melee, a white\nstorekeeper and a white soldier were killed. Redding and another Negro\nwere later executed for their part in the affair.\n\nIn 1925 Noble Drew Ali came to Chicago and established the Moorish\nAmerican Science Temple. Actually, he had previously attempted to\norganize other temples in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. He\nclaimed that American Negroes were of Moorish descent and, instead of\nbeing really black, were olive-hued. His movement had a banner which\ncarried a Moorish star and crescent on a field of red. He also claimed\nthat American Negroes, being Moors, had an Islamic heritage rather than a\nChristian one, and he endeavored to spread his particular version of that\nfaith throughout the Afro-American community. By 1927 Ali had established\nbranches in Pittsburgh, Detroit, Philadelphia, Kansas City, Lansing, and\nelsewhere. He wrote his own version of the Koran which combined passages\nfrom the Moslem Koran,  the Christian Bible, and some of the writings of\nMarcus Garvey.\n\nAli gave his followers a new sense of identity. Most of them wore a fez\nwhich set them apart from the typical urban black. Many were also\nbearded, and each one carried a membership card. Having a different\nreligion from that of the typical ghetto black contributed further to\ntheir special sense of identity. Ali's teaching also made them feel that\nthey had a special and unique heritage of which they could be proud. His\nemphasis on separatism instead of on integration struck a harmonious note\nwith their disillusionment. Instead of leaving them in despair, it\npermitted them to face white America boldly.\n\nIn 1929 a power struggle broke out between Noble Drew Ali and Claude\nGreen, one of his organizers. When Green was found murdered, the\nChicago police charged Ali with the crime. While Ali was out on bond, he\ntoo died under mysterious circumstances.  While some claimed that he had\nbeen beaten by the police, others said that he had been \"mugged\" by\nGreen's followers. Before he was released on bail Ali wrote a letter from\nprison to his followers encouraging them to have faith in him and in\ntheir future. His letter bore distinctly messianic overtones. After\nassuring them that he had redeemed them, he concluded by extending to\nthem his peace and by commanding them to love one another. His movement\nsplintered after his death into innumerable competing  factions.\n\nIn Detroit, sometime before 1930, a dark-skinned man appeared\nselling silk and raincoats. He said that he was W. D. Fard and that he\nhad come from the Holy City of Mecca in order to save the American Negro.\nPeople generally described him as being unusually light-skinned for a\nNegro with perhaps an Oriental cast. Fard also taught that the American\nNegro was Islamic in origin and that he should return to his ancestral\nfaith. Sometime in 1933 or 1934 he disappeared as mysteriously as he had\ncome.  While many believed that Fard and his movement must have been\nconnected with Noble Drew Ali and the Moorish American Science Temple,\nthe Black Muslims have always denied it.\n\nFard founded, in Detroit, Muslim Temple Number One, and he acquired a\nhandful of devout followers. He insisted that the Muslims should refrain\nfrom eating pork, should pray facing the East, and should practice a\ndaily washing ritual. Muslim members were reminded that their last names\nhad been imposed upon them by the white man whom Fard equated with the\nDevil. It is the practice among Muslims to drop their Christian name and,\nuntil their true names will be revealed to them, to substitute the letter\nX for their last name symbolizing the unknown.  Fard insisted that the\nfirst man had been a black man and that whites were a corruption of\nhumanity. The days of the White Devil, he said, were numbered. Blacks\nshould deliberately withdraw from white society in order not to be caught\nin its final destruction.\n\nThe Muslim's life was rigidly disciplined. There were temple services\nalmost every evening. Individual behavior and dress were carefully\ndictated. Besides forbidding the eating of pork, devout Muslims were not\nallowed to drink alcohol or smoke tobacco.  Relationships between men and\nwomen were extremely puritanical.  Each temple had special groups to\nprepare young men and women for manhood and womanhood. The Fruit of Islam\nwas the young men's group, and it was a semi-military defense corps aimed\nat developing a sense of manhood and the ability for self-defense.  The\ncommon belief that the Fruit of Islam was preparing for racial aggression\nhas never been substantiated. The Muslim Girls' Training Classes taught\ncooking, sewing, housekeeping, and etiquette.\n\nAfter Fard's disappearance, the leadership passed on to Elijah Muhammed,\nformerly Elijah Poole, whom Fard had been grooming as his successor.\nElijah Muhammed moved to Chicago and began Temple Number Two and\nestablished his headquarters there. The \"Black Muslims\", as well as other\nsmall, semi-religious, separatist groups, continued to exist unnoticed by\nthe general public. When Malcolm Little, better known as Malcolm X, was\nconverted to the \"Nation of Islam\", he gave the movement the\norganizational skill and the eloquence which it previously lacked.  This\nbrought it into national prominence.\n\nBlack Nationalism and the Negro Renaissance shared a strong sense of\nracial consciousness and racial pride. However, while the writers who\nexpressed the spirit of the new Negro still believed in their future in\nAmerica, the black nationalists enunciated a mood of alienation and\ndespair. The Depression, which eroded the hopes of many Americans, hit\nthe Negro unusually hard. It served to increase the level of bitterness\nin the Afro-American community as a whole.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nFighting Racism at Home and Abroad\n\n\nHard Times Again\n\nTHE new Negro of the 1920s who had struck out for \"the Promised Land\"\nfound, in the 1930s, that his old enemies of hunger, cold, and prejudice\nwere lurking outside the door of his newly chosen home. Hope slid into\ndespair and cynicism. The dynamic, self-confident Harlem which Johnson\nhad described in 1925 as the Culture Capital of the Negro World became\nchoked with disillusionment and frustration, and, in 1935, it was the\nscene of looting, burning, and violence.\n\nWhile the Depression which swept America in 1929 was a national disaster,\nit did not hit all segments of society equally, In America, poverty and\nstarvation are also discriminatory. To quote the old adage again, \"The\nNegro is the last to be hired and the first to be fired.\" The Depression\nalso proved that Harlem, like other Afro-American communities, was not as\neconomically self-sufficient as Johnson had imagined.  Although such\ncommunities had many Negro-owned businesses thriving on a Negro trade,\nthese businesses were still dependent on the economy at large. Therefore,\nthey were not at all free from the racial discrimination in the nation.\nTheir clientele was largely employed in white-owned businesses. Many\nNegroes were laid off, and Negro-owned businesses immediately felt the\npinch.\n\nAlthough Negro businesses had grown significantly during the 1920s, most\nwere small establishments and, in the age of mass production and mass\nmarketing, always had to struggle hard in order to compete. In 1929, the\nColored Merchants Association was established in New York City, and it\nattempted to buy goods for independent stores on a cooperative wholesale\nbasis. This aided them in competing with chain stores. The Association\nalso urged blacks to patronize stores owned by Afro-Americans.\nNevertheless, the Association only survived for two years. The\nAfro-American community felt the Depression sooner and harder than did\nthe rest of the country.\n\nBy 1932, the government believed that 38 percent of the Afro-American\ncommunity was incapable of self-support and in need of government relief.\nAt the same time, it considered that only 17 percent of the white\ncommunity fell into this category. In October of 1933, between 25 percent\nand 40 percent of the blacks in many of the large cities, to which they\nhad moved to find a brighter future, were on relief. This percentage was\nthree or four times higher than that of the whites in the same cities. As\naffluent whites felt the economic pinch, one of the first items to be\ntrimmed from their shrinking budgets was the maid or the gardener. In\n1935 the number of unemployed Negro domestics was at least one and a half\nmillion. In that same year, the government estimated that 65 percent of\nthe Negro employables in Atlanta were on public assistance while, in\nNorfolk, 80 percent of the Afro-American community was on relief.\n\nAs Negro unemployment statistics skyrocketed in the early thirties,\nThe-Jobs-for-Negroes Movement strove to alleviate the crisis. It was\nbegun by the Urban League in St. Louis. A boycott was organized against\nwhite-owned chain stores which catered to Negroes, but refused to employ\nthem.  The movement spread throughout the Midwest and had some success in\n\"persuading\" white-owned stores in the heart of the ghettoes to hire\nNegro employees. When the idea reached Harlem, it resulted in the\nestablishment of the Greater New York Coordinating Comittee. One of its\nfounders and organizers was the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., and the\nComittee received considerable support from his church, the Abyssinian\nBaptist Church.\n\nIt was Powell's claim that the Comittee was shunned by most \"respectable\"\nNegroes but that its supporters included an unusually wide variety of\nradicals. The group referred to its members as antebellum Negroes by\nwhich, Powell said, they meant before Civil War II.  Some of them, he\nclaimed, favored repatriation to Africa; others were for black\ncapitalism; still another group, including Powell himself, wanted the\nNegro to achieve full dignity within the American system. In spite of the\nvariety of their objectives, all of them believed that the Afro-American\nmust first achieve economic security before any of these specific goals\ncould be attained.\n\nIt was on this primary tactical necessity that they were able to\ncoordinate their activities. They picketed white-owned stores on 125th\nStreet. They carried signs advocating, \"Don't buy where you can't work,\"\nand Powell maintained that they were able almost to stop trade totally at\nany target they chose to picket. He claimed to be able to call a meeting\nwith only forty-eight hours notice and have 10,000 persons in attendance.\nThe 125th Street stores soon negotiated and began employing Negro\nemployees. Next, the Comittee hit the city's utility companies. They\nurged Negroes not to use electricity on specified days. They harassed the\ntelephone company by urging Negroes to demand that the operator place\ntheir calls instead of their dialing the number and utilizing the\nautomatic exchanges. Both companies changed their employment patterns in\nresponse. The Comittee also boycotted the bus company until it began\nemploying Negroes as drivers as well as on other levels of the company's\nstaff.\n\nBy 1935 Harlem had become a pressure cooker which was heated to the\nboiling point by economic and racial frustrations. When a young Negro\nstole a knife from a 125th Street store, it became the incident which\ntriggered a social explosion. Although he had escaped from the pursuing\nofficer a rumor spread around the community that he had been beaten to\ndeath. A mob soon gathered and began to protest everything from the\ndiscrimination practices of merchants to slum landlords and police\ntactics. Window-breaking, looting, and burning soon followed. Before\npeace was restored, three Negroes had been killed, some two hundred\nstores smashed, and it was estimated that approximately $2,000,000 worth\nof damage had been done.  Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia appointed a study\ncommission which was headed by the noted black sociologist E.  Franklin\nFrazier.  The commission concluded that the causes of the riot were\nrooted in resentment against racial discrimination and poverty.  The\n\"promised land\" of the large northern cities had not lived up to\nexpectations.\n\nThe Depression, however, brought its own kind of hope. Franklin Delano\nRoosevelt, who had been elected in 1932, promised the country a \"New\nDeal.\" It was to be a new deal for the workers, the unemployed and, it\nseemed, for the Negro too. In response, black voters switched to the\nDemocratic party in droves. While Franklin D. Roosevelt was not the first\npresident to appoint Negroes to government positions, his appointments\nwere different in two major respects. First, there were more of them.\nSecond, instead of being political payoffs, the appointees were selected\nfor their expert knowledge, and their intellectual skills became part of\nthe government's decision-making processes.\n\nThis group, which became informally known as the \"Black Cabinet,\"\nincluded such prominent Afro-American leaders as Robert L. Vann of The\nPittsburgh Courier, William H. Hastie of the Harvard Law School, Eugene\nKinckle Jones of the Urban League, Mrs. Mary McLeod Bethune of the\nNational Council of Negro Women, Robert C. Weaver, and Ralph Bunche, who\nlater became the first Negro to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  The\nnumber of Afro-Americans hired by the Federal Government mushroomed\nrapidly.\n\nBetween 1933 and 1946 the number rose from 50,000 to almost 200,000.\nMost, however, were employed in the lower, unskilled and semi-skilled,\nbrackets. It was also during this period that the civil service\nterminated its policy of requiring applicants to state their race and to\ninclude photographs.  Individual personnel officers, nevertheless, could\nand did continue to discriminate.\n\nIn spite of the attempt of the Roosevelt Administration to elevate the\nstatus of the Afro-American, the New Deal itself became enmeshed in\nracial discrimination in three ways: through discriminatory practice\nwithin government bureaus, through exclusion carried on by unions, and\nalso as an indirect by-product of the success of the New Deal programs.\nIn a government bureaucracy, power and authority are distributed\nthroughout the administrative hierarchy. Officials at varying levels were\nstill influenced by their personal prejudices, and they continued to use\ntheir positions in a discriminatory manner. Regardless of the intentions\nat the top, prejudice continued to exist in varying degrees throughout\nthe lower levels of the structure.\n\nIn 1935 the Wagner Act protected the rights of labor unions, but because\nmost unions practiced racial discrimination, it served indirectly to\nundercut the status of the Negro worker for a short time.  Actually, with\nthe heightened competition for jobs, unions tended to intensify their\ndiscrimination. The American Federation of Labor largely consisted of\ntrade or skilled workers.  Its member unions regularly practiced racial\nexclusion and kept blacks out of the trades.  To the contrary, the United\nMine Workers Union which had been organized on an industry-wide basis\nrather than a craft basis had encouraged the participation of Negroes\nwithin the union since at least 1890. In 1935, several union leaders, led\nby John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers, decided that the union\nmovement must break away from its craft orientation and begin to organize\nthe new mass production industries on an industry-wide basis.\n\nWhile the A. F. of L. dragged its feet, the dissidents withdrew and\nformed the Congress of Industrial Organizations.  Immediately they began\nto organize the steel workers, the meat packers and the automobile\nworkers. These were all industries which employed significant numbers of\nAfro-Americans, and the CIO followed an aggressive, nondiscriminatory\npolicy. In the beginning, black workers were suspicious, but they soon\njoined the new unions in large numbers.  In the long run, both black and\nwhite labor benefited from the Wagner Act.\n\nFinally, the New Deal failed to extend its program to include either\nagricultural or domestic workers. These were areas in which\nAfro-Americans were employed in unusually high proportions, and this\nmeant that a large portion of the Afro-American community was not covered\nby this legislation. For example, both the Social Security and the\nMinimum Wage laws excluded both agricultural and domestic workers.\nNevertheless, it was estimated that in 1939 some one million Negroes owed\ntheir livelihood to the Works Progress Administration. If it had not been\nfor the W.P.A., the National Youth Administration, the Civilian\nConservation Corps, and other similar organizations, Afro-Americans would\nhave suffered even more during the Depression.\n\nSome relief was brought to farmers through the Agricultural Adjustment\nAdministration.  However, white landlords usually kept the checks which\nhad been intended for the sharecroppers.  This resulted in the formation\nof The Southern Tenant Farmers' Union, an interracial organization.\nDespite the landlords' attempts to use racism to destroy it, the Union\nshowed that white and black farmers could cooperate on the basis of their\ncommon economic plight. This alliance of poor whites and poor blacks was\nreminiscent of the earlier Populist Movement.\n\nAlthough the New Deal did much to help the Negro, it tended to further\nundercut his self-confidence and independence.  Alain Locke has argued\nthat the significant fact about the northward migration by blacks had\nbeen that the Afro-Americans had made a decision for themselves. The fact\nof having made a decision and of taking action on it, Locke maintains,\nwas the event which created the aggressive self-confident New Negro. In\nhelping him to survive the Depression, the New Deal turned him again into\na passive recipient. The large number of Afro-Americans who were\nreceiving government aid in one way or another were aware of their\ndependency. Afro-American communities, which had been regarded as \"The\nPromised Land,\" slid into poverty and dejection.\n\n\nThe Second World War\n\nAs ominous war clouds began to gather over Europe in the late 1930s, most\nAmericans were preoccupied with domestic problems resulting from the\nDepression. Those who took notice of the ascendancy of Mussolini and\nHitler were apt to be impressed with their successes in combatting the\neffects of the Depression in Italy and Germany. The Afro-American\ncommunity, however, was more concerned with the imperialistic and racist\nelements in the teachings of Fascism and National Socialism.  Usually,\nAmerican Negroes were prevented from looking beyond their own problems by\nthe immediacy of racial prejudice which they faced daily, but this time\nthey were among the first to warn of impending danger.\n\nRacist thought in Germany did not begin with the rise of Adolf Hitler.\nEuropean anti-Semitism can be traced back into the past for centuries.\nAlthough it originally had its roots in a religious feeling, racism\nbecame secularized and, by the middle of the nineteenth century, took on\npolitical overtones and tried to assume a scientific foundation.\n\nAggressive nationalism began to bloom at the beginning of the nineteenth\ncentury, and went on to spread across Europe. The political unification\nof Germany, instead of being the glorious culmination of this\nnationalistic drama, only signaled the end of one act and the beginning\nof another. Even the German defeat in the First World War did not\npersuade ardent nationalists to be content with the victories they had\nalready achieved. Instead, they probed the heart of the nation to find an\nexplanation for their defeat. These nationalists contended that the\ndefeat had been due to pollution of racial purity by the presence of a\nlarge, alien element--the Jews. If it had not been for this impurity, it\nwas argued, Germany would certainly have been victorious, and it would\nhave demonstrated its global superiority. Aggressive nationalism became\nvirulent racism.\n\nAdolf Hitler exploited this need for a political scapegoat and turned it\ninto a national, anti-Semitic campaign. The racial stereotypes and\naccompanying feelings were already widespread.  Nineteenth century\npopular German literature was full of such trite symbols. The Jew was\nalways portrayed as a villainous merchant, shifty-eyed, large-nosed,\nunscrupulous, and wealthy.  In contrast, the German was invariably\nportrayed as a solid, blond-haired peasant, hard-working, loyal, and\nexploited.\n\nThe drama in such literature sprang from the tension between the wealthy\nJewish merchants and the hard-working but poor German peasants.  Here\ncould be found the same kind of exploitation which Hitler used to explain\nthe German defeat in the war.  These popular stereotypes were then joined\nto the teachings of Houston Stewart Chamberlain which had built on\nelements from biology, anthropology, sociology, and phrenology. In his\nbook Foundations of the Nineteenth Century, Chamberlain had developed\nthem into a philosophy of world history which centered on the concepts of\nracial conflict. Human progress and racial purity were equated. He\npredicted an eventual struggle to the death between the Jewish and the\nTeutonic races. The Germans, he believed, would emerge victorious.\nThrough the survival of the fittest and the destruction of the weak,\nmankind would reach a higher stage of evolution. Although Nazi racist\nthought was concerned almost exclusively with the conflict between the\nGermans and the Jews, it was clear that the Negro race was, if anything,\nconsigned to an even lower level of importance than the Jews. In the\nsurvival of the fittest, Negroes were also destined for extermination in\nthe name of human progress.\n\nAfro-American suspicions about the nature of Mussolini's imperialism\nproved to be justified when Italy invaded Ethiopia.  Mussolini's dream of\nreviving Roman glory included rebuilding a powerful empire. However,\nunderdeveloped countries which were not already dominated by European\nnations and which could easily be colonized, were few in number. When\nItaly invaded Ethiopia, Afro-Americans saw it as another white nation\nsubjugating another black nation. At the very time when Africans and\nAfro-Americans were looking forward to the liberation of Africa from\nEuropean domination, Italy was extending imperialism even further and\nconquering the last remaining independent supposedly black nation in\nAfrica. Afro-Americans were outraged. They looked to the League of\nNations hoping that it would take decisive action against the Italian\naggression. Their hopes were in vain.\n\nThe war that began in 1939 came to be expressed in terms which were even\nmore ideological than had been true of the First World War. The Allies\ndepicted themselves as being the champions of freedom and humanity while\nthey portrayed their enemies as tyrants and barbarians.  Afro-Americans\nwere painfully aware of some of the imperfections in this simple\ndichotomy. While aghast at the racist teachings propagated by Germany,\nthey could not forget the racism which confronted them daily within the\nUnited States.\n\nThey were also aware of the imperialism which was practiced by both the\nBritish and the French who dominated and exploited Africa almost at will.\nNevertheless, Hitler's form of brazen racism did give a note of validity\nto this ideological formulation. Afro-Americans viewed the war both with\nmore enthusiasm and with more pessimism than they had felt at the\noutbreak of the First World War. On the one hand, they could eagerly\nsupport a war to defeat Hitler's racist doctrines. On the other hand,\nthey did not believe that any display of patriotism on their part would\nsignificantly diminish racism at home. During the First World War they\nhad thought that a demonstration of patriotism would help to knock down\nthe walls of antagonism. Instead, they found that manliness on the part\nof Afro-Americans, even in the name of patriotism, was a threat to those\nwhites who believed that Negroes should be kept in their place.\nAfro-Americans were prepared not to be disillusioned in that way again.\nFor them, the war would still be a double struggle-fighting racism at\nhome as well as abroad.\n\nThe Second World War began to affect Americans long before the country\nwas actually drawn into the fighting. Although the American nation stood\non the sidelines for the first two years, America became a major source\nof money, supplies, and encouragement for Britain and France.  Providing\nmateriel for the Allies gave new life to the sagging American economy.\nThere were still some five million unemployed in the nation, and\nsomething more seemed to be needed. Unfortunately for the Afro-American,\nmost of the new jobs were not open to them. Aside from the fact that he\nwas the first to be fired and the last to be hired, many of the new\ndefense industries made it clear that they would hire no Negroes at all\nor, at most, would restrict their employment to janitorial positions\nregardless of the training or education of the applicant.\n\nHostility was expressed quite openly by some leaders in the West Coast\naircraft industry. As better jobs became available, they were quickly\nfilled by white workers eager to improve their economic status. This left\nsome of the more undesirable jobs to go begging, and, as the result, the\nwar boom benefits began to trickle down to the Afro-American community.\nAfro-Americans, however, were not content with the crumbs from the\nindustrial table. Complaints began to flood into Washington.  Several\ngovernment officials made pronouncements condemning discrimination in\ndefense industries, but they were not heard.  It became clear that\nnothing would change without strong government action, and it was also\nevident that this would not occur unless the entire Afro-American\ncommunity could exert united, political pressure.\n\nEarly in 1941, A. Philip Randolph put forth the idea of a gigantic March\non Washington, and he expressed the belief that a hundred thousand\nAfro-Americans could be organized to participate in such an undertaking.\nThe immediate response from most of the leaders of both black and white\nAmerica was one of skepticism. Most of them felt that there was too much\napathy in the Afro-American community for such a grandiose scheme to be\ntaken seriously.  Nevertheless, interest on the grass-roots level\ngradually grew and Randolph's idea was transformed into a project\ninvolving scores of organizers all across the country, all of whom were\nworking diligently to enlist potential marchers. In the meantime,\nRandolph began to formulate the complex plans for organizing the actual\nmarch. By late spring, skepticism had turned to worry.  Many government\nleaders and finally President Roosevelt himself tried to talk Randolph\ninto canceling the march.  They suggested that such an aggressive protest\nwould do more to hurt the Afro-American than help him.\n\nRandolph remained unyielding. Others tried to suggest that the protest\nwould be bad for the American image and therefore was unpatriotic. When\nthey suggested that it would create a bad impression in Rome and Berlin,\nAfro-Americans retorted that white racism had already created such an\nimage. Finally, Roosevelt contacted Randolph and offered to issue an\nexecutive order barring discrimination in defense industries and promised\nto put \"teeth\" in the order, provided Randolph call off the march. When\nRandolph became convinced that Roosevelt's intentions were sincere, he\ncomplied.\n\nRoosevelt fulfilled his promise by issuing Executive Order 8802, which\ncondemned discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or creed. Then,\nhe established the Fair Employment Practices Commission and assigned to\nit the responsibility for enforcing the order. Many Afro-Americans felt\nthat Executive Order 8802 was the most important government document\nconcerning the Negro to be issued since the Emancipation Proclamation.\nTheir immediate joy was somewhat dampened when they found that\ndiscrimination still continued in some quarters. Nevertheless, the\nF.E.P.C. did condemn discrimination when it found it, and, as the result,\nmany new jobs began to open up for Negroes.\n\nOnce America was drawn into the fighting, Afro-Americans hurried to the\nenlistment centers to volunteer their services in the war against\nHitler's philosophy. However, it soon became clear that America intended\nto fight racism with a segregated army. The fact that Negroes were\nconfined to the more menial positions in the armed forces was what\nirritated Afro-Americans the most. The Negro army units were obviously\ngoing to be led by white officers. The Marine Corps was still not\naccepting any Negroes in its ranks at all. Complaints again began to pour\ninto Washington.\n\nAfro-Americans generally admitted that the Selective Service Act per se\nwas not discriminatory and that it was applied impartially in most\nplaces. One of the reasons for this impartiality, undoubtedly, was the\nfact that both local and national Selective Service Boards included\nAfro-American representation. In the course of the war, about one million\nAfro-Americans saw service on behalf of their country. Their ratio within\nthe armed forces was almost the same as that within the nation. This had\nbeen the stated goal of the Department of War.\n\nGradually, the armed forces modified their discriminatory policies in\nresponse to the flood of complaints. The Air Force began to train Negro\npilots although they still received segregated training and served in\nsegregated squadrons. The Marine Corps accepted Negro recruits for the\nfirst time in its history. They, too, served in segregated units. The\nNavy, which had restricted Negroes to menial positions, gradually began\nto accept them in almost all noncommissioned positions. Eventually, it\neven began to commission some Negro officers. The Army, too, introduced\nan extensive program to prepare Negro officers. It trained most of them\nin integrated facilities, but they continued to lead segregated units.\nAs the war grew to a close, the Army announced that it intended to\nexperiment with integration.  However, when the experiment took place,\nthe integration proved not to be quite what had been expected. Instead of\nputting individuals from both races together in the same unit, the Army\ntook segregated black and white platoons and merged them into an\nintegrated fighting force although the platoons themselves remained\nsegregated.\n\nThis integrated unit did fight well in the field and made a significant\ncontribution to the defeat of Germany in 1945. Negro units, as well as\nindividual Negro soldiers, made outstanding contributions to the war\neffort both in Europe and in the Pacific, and they received numerous\ncommendations and citations.  Skeptics noted, however, that not a single\nNegro soldier had received the Congressional Medal of Honor in either the\nFirst or Second World Wars, and they suggested that the nation's highest\naward was being reserved for whites.\n\nAlthough most of the hostilities were focused on the enemy, racial\ntensions still ran very high within America. Southern whites were\ndispleased with the self-confidence and manliness brought out in Negroes\nby military experience, and they were unhappy with the dignity which a\nmilitary uniform conferred upon them.\n\nAt the same time, Negro soldiers in the South were angry over the\nharassment and segregation with which they were confronted. In\nparticular, they were irritated by the fact that German prisoners of war\nwere permitted to eat with white American soldiers in the same dining car\non a railroad train traveling through the South, while Negro soldiers\ncould not.  Racial riots occurred at Fort Bragg, Camp Robinson, Camp\nDavis, Camp Lee, Fort Dix, and a notorious one at an American base in\nAustralia. The policy of the War Department was to gloss over these\nevents. Casualties which resulted from riots at bases in the United\nStates were officially listed as accidental deaths.  Those which resulted\nfrom riots overseas were officially reported as being killed in action.\nOn several occasions, Negro soldiers refused to do work which they\nbelieved had been assigned to them purely because of their race. For this\nthey were charged with mutiny.\n\nThere was also one serious civilian race riot during the war; it occurred\non June 20, 1943, in Detroit. A fist fight between a white man and a\nNegro sparked the resentment which had been mounting in that city.\nThousands of Afro-Americans had been moving again from the South into the\nNorth to fill vacant jobs in war industry, and this was resented by local\nwhite residents.  Before the Detroit riot ended, twenty-five Negroes and\nnine whites had been killed. President Roosevelt had to send in federal\ntroops to quell the disturbance.  Another factor which irritated\nAfro-Americans was that the Red Cross blood banks separated Negro and\nwhite blood. This was particularly humiliating in that it had been a\nNegro doctor, Charles Drew, who had done the basic research that made the\nbanks possible.\n\nIn spite of this, Afro-Americans were eager to demonstrate their\npatriotism and to support the war effort. Besides the hundreds of\nthousands who were involved directly in the military, millions more\nsupported the war effort in countless other ways. Besides growing their\nown vegetables, saving tin cans and newspapers, they were avid\ncontributors to the War Bond issues. Others volunteered to serve as block\nwardens in case of enemy air raids.  Negro newspapers had their own\njournalists at the front, and the Afro-American community eagerly kept up\nwith the war news. They took special pride in stories of heroism about\nNegro soldiers.  When Hitler and his racist philosophy went down in\ndefeat, they felt that they had achieved a personal victory and that at\nthe same time they had made a contribution to America and the world.\n\nThus, as the war came to a close and Afro-Americans looked forward to the\npostwar years with both apprehension and determination, they feared that,\nwith the foreign antagonism eradicated, racist feeling at home might\nincrease. At the same time, they were possessed by a new drive to make\nAmerican democracy into a reality. The ideological character of the war\nhad reminded them of America's expressed ideals of brotherhood and\nequality. Their participation in the war convinced them that they were\nworthy of full citizenship. Many had broken the bonds of tradition which\nhad held them in fear and apathy. Some had left their communities to\nfight in the Army, and some had moved into large urban centers to work in\ndefense industries. Although the war against racism abroad had ended,\nthey were intent to see that the struggle for racial freedom and equality\nat home would continue.\n\n\nThe U.S. and the U.N.\n\nThe San Francisco Conference which founded the United Nations\norganization was looked upon by peoples around the world as the sunrise\nof a new day of peace and brotherhood. While hope ran high in most\nquarters, some of these same peoples were suspicious about its lofty\nideological character. Humanitarian ideologies had made their appearance\nbefore, but there had always been a gap between theory and practice.\nColored peoples and other minorities around the world observed the San\nFrancisco Conference with hope mixed with caution.  They wanted to see\nwhether it was mere ideological rhetoric which would salve the\nconsciences of the exploiters and dull the senses of the exploited, or\nwhether, perhaps, its aims might spring from genuine conviction and\nbecome established in a framework which would be fully implemented.\n\nThe U.N. was to be more sweeping in its goals and programs than the\nLeague had been, and it was hoped that it would have more power to carry\nout its decisions. Its very initials signified that the peoples of the\nworld were to be one people bound together in brotherhood, freedom, and\nequality. This should have meant the end of imperialistic exploitation as\nwell as the end of minority persecution. The Afro-American community\nwondered if the U.N. would apply these principles to them. Many skeptics\nsuggested that the U. S. initiative in founding the U.N. was only part of\na plan to create a world image which would help America in her new role\nas a world leader.\n\nSeveral Afro-Americans were accredited as official observers at the San\nFrancisco Conference. Their number included Mrs. Mary McLeod Bethune, Dr.\nMordecai W. Johnson of Howard University, W. E. B. DuBois and Walter\nWhite, both of the N.A.A.C.P. Ralph Bunche was an official member of the\nAmerican staff. There were also a large number of Negro journalists, and\nthe conference was widely covered in the Negro press.  Once the U.N. was\norganized and in operation, several other Afro-Americans worked for it in\na number of ways. While some held diplomatic posts, others used their\nspecific scientific and scholarly skills to help various branches of the\nU.N. They were particularly interested in the departments concerned with\nthe treatment of colonial nations and with the various scientific\norganizations involved in helping underdeveloped countries.\n\nThe United Nations Charter defended universal human rights more clearly\nthan any previous political document in world history.  The Charter\nproclaimed human rights and freedom for all without respect to \"race,\nsex, language or religion.\" Minority groups were particularly interested\nin the work of UNESCO which, among other things, studied the nature of\nprejudice and racism and tried to develop programs to eradicate these\nevils. The U.N. also formed a Human Rights Commission, and Afro-Americans\nexpected that whatever action the U.N. took to support human rights\nthroughout the world would also have an impact on their situation.\n\nThe first test came in 1946 when India charged South Africa with\npracticing racial discrimination against Indian nationals and their\ndescendants who were living within South Africa. Minority groups\nthroughout the world eagerly waited to see what, if anything, the U.N.\nwould do. When a resolution was passed by a two-thirds majority, charging\nSouth Africa with the violation of human rights, and requiring it to\nreport back on what steps had been taken to alter the situation,\nreligious and national minorities were overjoyed. However, the enthusiasm\nof Afro-Americans was dampened by the fact that both the United States\nand Britain had voted against the resolution. While posing as the leaders\nof democracy and humanitarianism, they seemed more concerned with\nprotecting their sovereign rights as nations against similar future\ncharges which might impinge on their sovereignty, than they were with\nprotecting the human rights of oppressed peoples.\n\nThe attitude which the U. S. Government took towards human rights sheds\nconsiderable light on the internal conflict concerning race within\nAmerica itself. The U. S. led the fight at the U.N. for the approval of\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet the American government\nhas been reluctant to support the inclusion of specific economic and\nsocial rights in a draft treaty.  The U.N. had endeavored to write a\ndraft treaty which its member nations would sign and which would be\nbinding on them. If the U. S. Senate had ratified such a document, its\nterms presumably would then be binding on the entire nation. At that\ntime, senators from the Southern states were still staunchly defending\nlegal segregation and disfranchisement of Afro-Americans. The government\nfound itself supporting human rights ideologically while backing down on\nthem in practice.\n\nAs the Cold War deepened, the U. S. became increasingly sensitive about\nits world image. While fighting for world leadership, Russia and America\neach claimed that its way of life was based on the principles of\nbrotherhood and humanitarianism. Each, in turn, tried to prove to the\nrest of the world that its ideology was genuinely humane and democratic,\nwhile its opponent's ideology was, in reality, oppressive and\ndehumanizing. The communist bloc attacked the West for being purveyors of\nimperialism and racism.  This forced the American government to face up\nto the discriminatory policies within the nation and, especially, to\nreexamine the legal discrimination existing within the Southern states.\nIt was particularly embarrassing to the American ambassador to the United\nNations to have to be berated by the Russian delegate concerning some\nunpleasant racial events which had happened somewhere in the South. The\nFederal Government had always followed a policy of \"hands off,\" at least\nsince the days of Hayes and the end of Reconstruction. Party politicians\nalways opposed taking a strong federal stand against an established state\npolicy within the South for fear of what would happen to that party\nwithin the South. Party unity had almost always been put above civil\nrights or justice.\n\nHowever, these same party politicians could not ignore world opinion.\nEven from a narrow political point of view, a party could not permit the\nnation's world image to become tarnished, lest the electorate become\ndissatisfied. World leadership brought with it the need to be concerned\nwith world opinion. Racism was no longer a local or state question. In\nfact, as W. E. B. DuBois had predicted, it had become the leading\nquestion of the twentieth century. At the end of the Second World War,\nWalter White, then executive director of the N.A.A.C.P., toured Europe\nand drew conclusions concerning the effect of the war and the course of\nthe future. In his book Rising Wind, White demonstrated a relationship\nbetween the oppressed peoples of the world, racism, and imperialism.\nThough a relative moderate, White warned of a future worldwide racial\nconflict.\n\nAs the war was drawing to an end in the Pacific theater, the Japanese\ncautioned Asiatics about American racial oppression.  What they called\nattention to was that the British dominated colored peoples in Africa and\nAsia and that the Americans persecuted their racial minority at home.\nWhite believed that this propaganda was taking root in the hearts of many\nAsiatics.  He also believed that most of Asia would slide into the\nRussian camp, thereby preparing the way for a third world conflict.  He\ncontended that Britain and America had a choice between ending their\npolicies of racial superiority and preparing for the next war.\n\nIn 1948 A. Philip Randolph began to advocate civil disobedience on the\npart of Afro-Americans, rather than ever again allowing themselves to be\npart of a segregated army. He recommended that they refuse to serve in\nfuture wars, and the idea received widespread attention. In a Senate\ncomittee inquiry, Senator Wayne Morse from Oregon suggested to him that\nsuch civil disobedience in wartime could well be viewed as treason and\nnot merely as civil disobedience. Clearly, Randolph's suggestion had hit\na sensitive nerve. A nation which had been skeptical about permitting\nAfro-Americans in its armed forces was now becoming extremely uneasy at\nthe thought that Afro-Americans might not want to serve.  In the same\nyear President Truman appointed a commission to study race relations in\nthe military. Its report, Freedom to Serve, recommended that the Armed\nForces open up all jobs regardless of race, color, or creed. As a result,\nthe military began to move slowly in the direction of integration.\nHowever, when the communists invaded South Korea, the issue quickly came\nto a head. Unless integration was achieved, America would have to fight\ncommunists and colored Asiatics with a segregated army and would have to\ndo it in the name of the United Nations.\n\nIn 1950 General Matthew Ridgway began to accelerate integration\nin the forces under his command. He did this partly as a matter\nof philosophy and partly from necessity. The Army needed the fullest and\nmost efficient use of the few troops available in order to stem the flow\nof a much larger communist force into South Korea. This integration\nproceeded very well, and when he was put in charge of all forces in the\nFar East, he asked the Defense Department for permission to integrate all\nof the forces in  the area. Within three months, the extent of\nintegration in the Armed Forces jumped from nine percent to thirty\npercent.  While Afro-Americans were pleased, they were also convinced\nthat it had been done more from the pressure of world opinion than from a\ngenuine humanitarian conscience.\n\nDuring this period, the Federal Government took a more active role in\nseveral other ways in regard to improving race relations.  How much of\nthis action sprang from internal motivation and how much resulted from\nthe pressure of world opinion is a matter of conjecture. In any case, the\nTruman Administration deliberately created an atmosphere favorable to\nchanging race relations within America. In 1946 Truman appointed a\ncomittee on civil rights which, after intensive study, published its\nreport, To Secure These Rights.\n\nThe report set forth that the Federal Government had the duty to act in\norder to safeguard civil rights when local or state governments either\ncould not or did not take such action. The comittee recommended enlarging\nthe size and powers of the civil rights section of the Justice Department\nand also recommended that the F.B.I. increase its civil rights activity.\nThe threat of federal intervention in state racial policies led to a\nrevolt by several Southern Senators within the Democratic Party. In 1948\nthey formed the Dixiecrat Party and refused to support many of the\npolicies and candidates of the Democratic Party.  Truman also appointed a\ncomittee to study higher education in America, and its report recommended\nan end to discrimination in colleges and universities. In 1948 Truman\nissued an executive order aimed at achieving fair employment within\ngovernment service. He also continued the practice of attacking\ndiscrimination within industries working under government contracts. In\n1948 the Supreme Court declared that restrictive covenants in housing\nwere unconstitutional. Many state and local governments across the\ncountry also took action against discrimination in the fields of housing\nand employment.\n\nThus the principles underlying the United Nations and the Declaration of\nHuman Rights had the effect of stirring democratic and humanitarian\nideals in many parts of white America.  Sensitivity to world opinion had\nmade all branches of the Federal Government more willing to act on racial\nmatters.  Although most Americans would have insisted that these\nactivities sprang from a genuine concern for racial justice,\nAfro-Americans were convinced that it had been the pressure of world\nopinion which had turned these humanitarian convictions into action.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\nCivil Rights and Civil Disobedience\n\n\nSchools and Courts\n\nTHE democratic idealism which had been fostered by the Second World War\nand the Cold War made many American citizens increasingly uncomfortable\nabout the legal support given to racism in the Southern states. A wide\nvariety of organizations--labor unions, religious and fraternal societies\nas well as groups specifically concerned with attacking racism--became\nincreasingly active in trying to put democratic ideals into practice.\nAmerica's competition with communism in gaining world leadership, made\nmany Americans feel that it was necessary to prove, once and for all, the\nsuperiority of the American way of life. However, there was a growing\nconcerted effort to destroy legal segregation because it was a serious\nblemish on this democratic image.\n\nBelieving strongly in the democratic process as these groups did, this\nattack was mounted within the framework of the legal system. The\nN.A.A.C.P. came to be the cutting edge of the campaign. In particular,\nthe Legal Defense Fund of the N.A.A.C.P.  and the small group of\nintelligent, dedicated Negro lawyers whom it financed, spearheaded the\nattack. It was clear that the legal system itself supported the position\nof Southern racists. Most Afro-Americans in the South could not vote, and\nSouthern senators were in a position to sabotage any attempt to change\nthe system through the legislative process. They were chosen through a\nwhite electorate, and Afro-Americans in the South could do little about\nthat. Even if a favorable majority in Congress stemming from the North\nand West could be established, the one-party system in the South meant\nthat Southern Senators were continually reelected and, therefore, had\nCongressional seniority. Consequently, they controlled most of the\ncomittees and were thereby in virtual control of the legislative process\nitself.\n\nAlthough the courts had usually interpreted the Constitution so as to\nsupport segregation, much of that document's language supported\ndemocratic and equalitarian principles. If the courts could be persuaded\nto understand the Constitution differently, legal segregation might well\nbe found to be unconstitutional. The judicial system to some degree\nreacts to popular pressure and events, and it too was influenced by the\nneed to justify American democracy to the rest of the world.\n\nThe N.A.A.C.P. had already mounted a broad, concerted attack against\nlegal segregation before the Second World War. When Walter White defeated\nW. E. B. DuBois in a struggle for leadership, he confirmed the\nAssociation's emphasis on striving for an integrated society.  The number\nof white and middle-class black supporters of the N.A.A.C.P.  grew, and\nits treasury prospered. The Association chose to concentrate its efforts\non a gradual, relentless attack against segregation through the courts.\nBelieving that education was an all-important factor in society, it\ndecided that school desegregation should become the major target.\n\nThurgood Marshall was the master strategist in the school desegregation\ncampaign. He decided that the attack should be a slow, indirect one.\nMost Southern school systems, although they had developed two separate\ninstitutions, had not established separate graduate and professional\nfacilities for Negroes.  Marshall decided to attack the school question\non the graduate, professional, and law-school level. First, Southerners\ndid not seem as frightened about racial mixing on the graduate school\nlevel, and second, the cost of developing separate graduate and\nprofessional schools for a handful of Negro students, it was reasoned,\nwould be prohibitive.\n\nIn 1938, in Gaines v. Canada, the Supreme Court declared that Missouri's\nfailure to admit a Negro, Lloyd Gaines, to the state law school, when the\nstate did not have a comparable \"separate but equal\" institution for\nNegroes, constituted a violation of the \"equal-protection\" clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment.  Missouri wanted to solve the problem by paying the\nstudent's tuition in an integrated Northern law school, but the Court\nrefused to accept that as a solution. It argued that the state had\nalready created a privilege for whites which it was denying to Negroes.\nThis, in itself, was a Constitutional violation.\n\nA decade passed without any further action. In 1948, the Supreme Court\nattacked Oklahoma for its failure to permit a Negro to enroll in its\nstate law school. The Oklahoma Board of Regents, then, decided to admit\nNegroes to any course of study not provided for by the state college for\nNegroes. This was a considerable step forward.\n\nIn 1950, in Sweatt v. Painter, the Supreme Court condemned an attempt by\nthe state of Texas to establish a special law school overnight in which\nit could enroll a Negro applicant. The Court said that this fly-by-night\ninstitution was not equal, and it insisted that an equal institution must\ninclude equal faculty, equal library, and equal prestige. It argued that\npart of an equal degree was the prestige conferred on the graduate by the\nstatus of that institution. To be equal, the Court reasoned, the separate\nschool must carry an equal degree of professional status. It also\ndecided, in McLaurin v. Oklahama Regents, that it was unconstitutional\nfor a university to segregate a Negro student within its premises.\nOklahoma had roped off part of its university's classrooms, library, and\ndining room as a means of accommodating a graduate student in the School\nof Education. The Court argued that this handicapped a student in his\npursuit of learning and that part of a graduate education included the\nability to engage in open discussion with other students.\n\nThese decisions, in essence, meant that the South was compelled to\nintegrate graduate and professional schools. In themselves, they did not\nconstitute an attack on segregated education. They merely represented an\nattempt by the courts to guarantee that separate education was, in fact,\nequal education. Southern states, recognizing the trend of events, began\ncrash programs to build and upgrade their Negro school systems. At this\npoint, the N.A.A.C.P. was not certain whether to push on for total\ndesegregation or whether temporarily to settle for quality education.\nHowever, the stubbornness of some Southern school boards in refusing to\nupgrade Negro schools forced the N.A.A.C.P.  lawyers into their decision\nto make an outright attack on legal segregation.\n\nIn 1950 N.A.A.C.P. lawyers initiated a series of suits around the country\nattacking the quality of education in primary and secondary schools.\nThree of these suits--Topeka, Kansas, Clarendon County, South Carolina,\nand Prince Edward County, Virginia--became involved in the 1954 Supreme\nCourt desegregation decision.  The N.A.A.C.P. charged that these schools,\nbesides being inferior, were a violation of the \"equal-protection\" clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.  All of the suits, as had been expected,\nwere defeated in the local courts.  However, they were appealed.\n\nThough the Supreme Court had allowed the decision made in Plessy v.\nFerguson in 1896 to stand, the Court was moving closer to a reexamination\nof the \"separate but equal\" clause.  That decision had argued that\nseparate facilities, if they were equal, did not violate a citizen's\nright to equal protection under the law. It had become the cornerstone on\nwhich a whole dual society had been built. The Court had made no attempt,\nhowever, to guarantee that these separate institutions would be equal,\nand clearly they were not. At mid-century, the Court began by challenging\nthis dual system at points of blatant and obvious inequity. By 1950 in\nSweatt v. Painter, the Court was attacking subtle inequalities such as\nthat of institutional prestige. The next step was for the Court to ask\nwhether in fact separate institutions could ever be equal. In other\nwords, the question was whether segregation, in itself, constituted\ninequality and was an infringement on a citizen's rights.\n\nOn May 17, 1954, in Brown v. Board of Education of the City of Topeka,\nthe Supreme Court declared that school segregation was unconstitutional\nand that the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, which the Court itself had\nmaintained for half a century, was also unconstitutional. Although the\ndecision referred directly only to school segregation, in striking down\nthe \"separate but equal\" doctrine, the Supreme Court implied that all\nlegal segregation was unconstitutional. It contended that to separate\nchildren from other children of similar age and qualifications purely on\nthe grounds of race generated feelings of inferiority in those children.\nIt argued that the segregation of white and colored children in schools\nhad a detrimental effect on the colored children. Further, the Court\ninsisted that the damaging impact of segregation was greater when it had\nthe sanction of law. It pointed out that segregation was usually\ninterpreted as denoting the inferiority of the colored child.  This\nresulted in a crippling psychological effect on his ability to learn by\nundermining his self-confidence and motivation. Therefore, segregation\nwith the sanction of law deprived the child of equal education, and the\nCourt concluded that it was a violation of the \"equal-protection\" clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nSouthern whites were outraged, and they dubbed May 17 as \"Black Monday.\"\nNinety Southern Congressmen issued the \"Southern Manifesto\" condemning\nthe Court decision as a usurpation of state powers. They said that the\nCourt, instead of interpreting the law, was trying to legislate.\nSouthern states resurrected the old doctrine of interposition which they\nhad used against the Federal Government preceding the Civil War. Several\nstate legislatures passed resolutions stating that the Federal Government\ndid not have the power to prohibit segregation. Other Southerners\nresorted to a whole battery of tactics.  The Ku Klux Klan was revived\nalong with a host of new groups such as the National Association for the\nAdvancement of White People. The White Citizens' councils spearheaded the\nresistance movement.  Various forms of violence and intimidation became\ncommon. Bombings, beatings, and murders increased sharply all across the\nSouth. Outspoken proponents of desegregation were harassed in other ways\nas well. They lost their jobs, their banks called in their mortgages, and\ncreditors of all kinds came to collect their debts.\n\nIn 1955 the Supreme Court declared that its desegregation decision should\nbe carried out \"with all deliberate speed.\" Southern school districts,\nhowever, became experts in tactics of avoiding or delaying compliance. It\nbegan to appear that each school board would have to be compelled to\nadmit each individual Negro student. Even then, some officials said that\nthey would never comply. They persisted in arguing that the Court had\noverstepped its constitutional functions. Again, the constitutional\nquestion of federal vs. state authority had come to a head just as it had\na century earlier.\n\nIn 1957, the governor of Arkansas openly opposed a court decision\nordering the integration of the Central High School in Little Rock.  When\nfederal marshals were sent to carry out the order, Little Rock citizens\nwere in no mood to stand idly by and watch. Both the citizens and the\nlocal officials were united in opposing federal authority.  Everyone\nwatched to see what President Eisenhower would do in the face of this\nchallenge. On the one hand, Eisenhower and the Republicans had condemned\nthe increasing centralization of power in the federal government. On the\nother hand, Eisenhower had been a general who had been accustomed to\nhaving his subordinates carry out his orders.  Eisenhower, the general,\nmoved with decisiveness and sent troops into Little Rock to enforce the\nlaw. Although Eisenhower himself had said that men's hearts could not be\nchanged by legislation, he diligently fulfilled his functions as the head\nof the Executive Branch of the government. Surprisingly enough, it was\nalso under his administration that Congress passed the first Civil Rights\nAct since 1875. Although the bill was rather weak, it was an admission\nthat the Federal government had an obligation to guarantee civil rights\nto individual citizens and to act on their behalf when state and local\ngovernments did not. This was a reversal of the traditional \"hands off\"\nposition.\n\nIt cannot be stated with certainty that these events were merely\ncalculated responses to the changing world situation, but the Cold War\nand the emergence of an independent Africa were nevertheless realities\nwhich could not be overlooked.  Ghana had gained its status as an\nindependent nation. It had also sought and gained admission to the United\nNations in 1957, and in that same year, opened an embassy in Washington.\nAfrican diplomats, traveling through the United States, were outraged\nwhenever they were confronted by humiliations which were the consequence\nof segregation. Communist leaders, at the same time, took great pleasure\nin pointing out to these Africans the mistreatments of Afro-Americans\nwithin the United States. Although many Southern whites continued to\ninsist that their freedom to maintain a separate society apart from that\nof the blacks was an essential part of democracy as they understood it,\nmost Americans found legal segregation to be embarrassing in the face of\nAmerica's claim to the democratic leadership of the world. Afro-Americans\nexploited the situation in order to involve the Federal Government in\ntheir desegregation campaign.\n\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement\n\nOn December 1, 1955, an obscure black woman, Mrs. Rosa Parks, was riding\nhome on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. As the bus gradually filled up with\npassengers, a white man demanded that she give him her seat and that she\nstand near the rear of the bus. Mrs. Parks, who did not have the\nreputation of being a troublemaker or a revolutionary, said that she was\ntired and that her feet were tired. The white man protested to the bus\ndriver. When the driver also demanded that she move, she refused. Then,\nthe driver summoned a policeman, and Mrs. Parks was arrested.\n\nNone of this was unusual. Daily, all across the South, black women\nsurrendered their seats to demanding whites. Although most of them did it\nwithout complaint, the arrest of an obstructionist was entirely within\nthe framework of local laws and in itself was not a noteworthy event.\nHowever, the arrest of Mrs. Parks touched off a chain reaction within\nMontgomery's Afro-American community. If she had been a troublemaker, the\ncommunity might have thought that she had only received what she\ndeserved.  On the contrary, its citizens viewed her as an innocent,\nhardworking woman who had been mistreated. Her humiliation became their\nown.\n\nSpontaneous protest meetings occurred all across Montgomery, and the idea\nof retaliating against the entire system by conducting a bus boycott took\nhold. Almost immediately, the call for a black boycott of Montgomery\nbuses spread throughout the community, and car pools were quickly\norganized to help people in getting to and from their employment. Whites\nrefused to believe that the black community could either organize or\nsustain such a campaign.  Nevertheless, Montgomery buses were running\nhalf empty and all white.\n\nThe man chosen to lead the Montgomery bus boycott was a young Baptist\nminister named Martin Luther King, Jr. He and ninety others were indicted\nunder the provisions of an anti-union law which made it illegal to\nconspire to obstruct the operation of a business. King and several others\nwere found guilty, but they appealed their case. As the boycott dragged\non month after month, Montgomery gained national prominence through the\nmass media, and King quickly gained a national reputation. When the bus\ncompany was finally compelled to capitulate and to drop its policy of\nsegregated seating, King had become a national hero.  Mass resistance,\nincluding some forms of civil disobedience, became popular as the best\nway to achieve racial change.\n\nKing had already given considerable thought to the question of how best\nto achieve social change, and, more important, to do it within the\nframework of moral law. His experiences with direct action techniques in\nMontgomery helped him to confirm and to further elaborate his thinking.\nHis philosophy had been influenced by the writings of Henry Thoreau and\nMahatma Gandhi with the result that he developed an ideology of\nnonviolent resistance. Like Gandhi, King wanted to make clear that\nnonviolence was not the same as nonresistance. Both maintained that if it\nshould come to a choice between submission and violence, violence was to\nbe preferred. Both stressed that nonviolent resistance was not to be an\nexcuse for cowardice. To the contrary, nonviolent resistance was the way\nof the strong. It meant the willingness to accept suffering but not the\nintention to inflict it.\n\nKing believed in nonviolent resistance both as a tactic and as a\nphilosophy--both as means and end:\n\n\"... the nonviolent approach does something to the hearts and souls of\nthose comitted to it. It gives them new self-respect.  It calls up\nresources of strength and courage that they did not know they had.\nFinally, it so stirs the conscience of the opponent that reconciliation\nbecomes a reality.\"\n\nOn the philosophical level, King said that nonviolent resistance was the\nkey to building a new world. Throughout history, man had met violence\nwith violence and hate with hate. He believed that only nonviolence and\nlove could break this eternal cycle of revenge and retaliation. It was\nhis hope that the Negro, through utilizing the philosophy of nonviolent\nresistance, could help to bring about the birth of a new day. To King,\nnonviolent resistance implied that the resister must love his enemy:\n\"When we allow the spark of revenge in our souls to flame up in hate\ntoward our enemies, Jesus teaches, 'Love your enemies, bless them that\ncurse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which\ndespitefully use you, and persecute you.'\"\n\nTo him, love, in the most basic and Christian sense, did not require that\nthe resister had to feel a surge of spontaneous sentiment, but it did\nmean that he had made a deep and sincere commitment to the other person's\nbest interest. From this point of view, helping to free a racist from the\nshackles of his own prejudice was construed to be in his best interest\nand, therefore, a loving act. The Biblical injunction \"Love your neighbor\nas yourself\" meant being as concerned for his well-being as for your own.\nKing believed that, if injustice could be attacked and overcome through a\npolicy of nonviolent resistance, it would then lead to the creation of\nthe \"beloved community.\" This philosophy would become the means of\nreconciliation and, to put it in religious terms, would be redemptive.\n\nKing made it clear that nonviolent resistance was concerned with morality\nand justice and not merely with obtaining specific goals. When laws,\nthemselves, were unjust, nonviolent resistance could engage in civil\ndisobedience as a means of challenging those laws. Civil disobedience was\nnot to be understood merely as law-breaking. Instead, King said that it\nwas based in a belief in law and also in a belief in the necessity to\nobey the law.  However, when a particular law was grossly unjust, that\nunjust law itself endangered society's respect for law in general. If the\nunjust law could not be changed through normal legal channels, deliberate\nbreaking of that specific law might be justified. Because the person\nengaging in civil disobedience did believe in the value of law, he would\nbreak the unjust law openly, and he would willingly accept the\nconsequences for breaking it. He would participate in law-breaking and\naccept its penalty as a means of drawing the attention of the community\nto the immorality of that specific law.\n\nLargely inspired by the successful Montgomery bus boycott, mass protests\nand other direct action techniques began to spread rapidly throughout the\nSouth and even into the North. King was concerned that those using the\ntechnique should fully understand its meaning and value.  Otherwise, he\nfeared that it might be used carelessly and thereby distort its moral and\nredemptive quality. Therefore, King and a number of his supporters formed\nthe Southern Christian Leadership Conference as an organization to spread\nthese ideas and to provide help to any community which became involved in\nmassive, nonviolent resistance protests.\n\nOn February 1, 1960, four Negro students from the Agricultural and\nTechnical College in Greensboro, North Carolina, entered a Woolworth's\nvariety store and purchased several items. Then, they sat down at its\nlunch counter, which served whites only. When they were refused service,\nthey took out their textbooks and began to do their homework.  This\nprotest immediately made local news. The next day, they were joined by a\nlarge number of fellow students.\n\nIn a matter of weeks, student sit-ins were occurring at segregated lunch\ncounters all across the South. College and high school students by the\nthousands joined the Civil Rights Movement. These students felt the need\nto form their own organization to mobilize and facilitate the spontaneous\ndemonstrations which were springing up everywhere. This resulted in the\nformation of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Comittee. The S.C.L.C.\nand S.N.C.C. came to be the leading organizations in the Southern states.\nC.O.R.E.--Congress of Racial Equality--carried on the militant side of\nthe struggle in Northern urban centers, and it involved many Northern\nliberals in crusades to help the movement in the South.\n\nThe N.A.A.C.P. tended to be uncomfortable with the new direct action\ntechniques and preferred more traditional lobbying and legal tactics.  It\ndid get involved on a massive scale in giving legal aid to the thousands\nof demonstrators who were arrested for various legal infractions such as\nmarching without a parade permit, disturbing the peace, and for\ntrespassing. To some extent, the N.A.A.C.P. resented the fact that it had\nto carry the financial burden for the legal actions resulting from these\nmass protests, while the other organizations received all the publicity\nand most of the financial aid inspired by that publicity.\n\nBy the time the 1960 Presidential election approached, both political\nparties had become aware that the racial issue could not be ignored. In\nseveral Northern states, Afro-Americans held the balance of power in\nclose elections. Also, by that year, over a million Afro-Americans had\nbecome eligible to vote in the Southern states. John F. Kennedy, the\nDemocratic candidate, easily out-maneuvered his Republican opponent,\nRichard M. Nixon, in the search for Afro-American votes. Kennedy had\nprojected an image of aggressive idealism which captured the imagination\nof white liberals and of Afro-Americans.\n\nThe move which guaranteed the support of most Afro-Americans for Kennedy\ncame in October, a mere three weeks before the election.  Martin Luther\nKing, Jr., and several other Negroes had been arrested in Atlanta,\nGeorgia, for staging a sit-in at a department store restaurant. While the\nothers were released, King was sentenced to four months at hard labor.\nKennedy immediately telephoned his sympathy to Mrs. King. Meanwhile, his\nbrother and campaign manager, Robert Kennedy, telephoned the judge who\nhad sentenced him and pleaded for his release.  The next day, King was\nfreed. The news was carefully and systematically spread throughout the\nentire Afro-American community. When Kennedy defeated Nixon in November,\nAfro-Americans believed that their vote had been the deciding factor in\nthe close victory.\n\nTwo months after Kennedy took office, C.O.R.E., under the leadership of\nJames Farmer, began an intensive campaign, involving \"freedom rides.\"\nScores ind scores of whites and blacks were recruited from Northern\ncities and sent throughout the South to test the state of desegregation\nof travel facilities as well as of waiting rooms and restaurants. As the\ncampaign reached a climax, Attorney General Robert Kennedy became annoyed\nwith its intensity. Apparently, he had hoped that the direct actionists\nwould wait for the new Administration to take the lead in Civil Rights.\nInstead, they chose to try to make the new Administration live up to the\nimage which it had projected. Kennedy requested a cooling-off period, but\nthe freedom riders would not listen. But when the freedom riders were\nattacked in Montgomery, Alabama, without receiving adequate local police\nprotection, Kennedy sent six hundred federal marshals to escort them on\nthe rest of their pilgrimage.\n\nThe year 1963 was a target date for the Civil Rights Movement.  It was\nthe centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation, and the Movement adopted\nthe motto, \"free in '63.\" In the spring, the S.C.L.C.  spearheaded a\nmassive campaign in Birmingham for desegregation and fair employment.\nMarches occurred almost daily.  The marchers maintained their nonviolent\ntactics in the face of many arrests and much intimidation. In May, when\nthe police resorted to the use of dogs and high-pressure water hoses, the\nnation and the world were shocked, Sympathy demonstrations occurred in\ndozens of cities all across the country, and expressions of indignation\nresounded from all around the world.  In June, the head of Mississippi's\nN.A.A.C.P., Medgar Evers, was shot in the back outside his home and\nkilled. Scores of sympathy demonstrations again reverberated throughout\nthe country.  Violence in the South was on the increase.\n\nAlthough President Kennedy had intended to use his executive authority as\nhis main weapon in securing civil rights, the mounting pressure on both\nsides of the conflict forced him to take more drastic action, and he\nsubmitted a Civil Rights Bill to Congress. Opponents of the Bill were\nparticularly perturbed by the section which sought to guarantee the end\nof discrimination in all kinds of public accommodations--stores,\nrestaurants, hotels, motels, etc. They claimed that this was an invasion\nof the owners' property rights. It soon became clear that the Bill would\nbe entangled in a gigantic Congressional debate for months.  Civil Rights\nsupporters looked for new techniques which would bring added pressure on\nCongress. Again, the idea of a March on Washington was proposed, and this\ntime it was carried through.  The demonstration on August 28, 1963, was\nlarger than any previous one in the history of the capital. At least a\nquarter of a million blacks and whites, from all over America,\nrepresenting a wide spectrum of religious, labor, and civil rights\norganizations, flooded into Washington.\n\nThe occasion was peaceful and orderly. The marchers exuded an aura of\ninterracial love and brotherhood. The emotional impact on the\nparticipants was almost that of a religious pilgrimage. President\nKennedy, instead of trying to block the march as demanded by many\nCongressional leaders, aided it by providing security forces, and he also\nmet Personally with a delegation of its leaders. The high point of the\ndemonstration was Martin Luther King's famous speech:\n\n\"Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy. Now is the time\nto rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit\npath of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the\nquicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is\nthe time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.\n\n\"Now, I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the\ndifficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream\ndeeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this\nnation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold\nthese truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.'\n\n\"I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of\nformer slaves and the sons of former slave-owners will be able to sit\ndown together at the table of brotherhood.\n\n\"I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state\nsweltering with the people's injustice, sweltering with the heat of\noppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and Justice. I\nhave a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation\nwhere they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the\ncontent of their character.\n\n\"This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South\nwith--with this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of\ndespair a stone of hope.\"\n\nIn November, Congressional debate on the Civil Rights Bill was still\ncontinuing, but the President had now made the passage of the Civil\nRights Bill one of the most urgent goals of his Administration. But on\nthe 22nd of November, John F. Kennedy was gunned down in the Presidential\nlimousine in Dallas, Texas. The nation and the world were struck dumb\nwith disbelief.  Even those who had disliked his politics were horrified\nat the assassination of a President in a democratic state. His supporters\nfelt that they had lost a friend as well as a leader. In fact many\nregarded Kennedy as a savior.\n\nThe sense of shock caused despair and gloom. The fact that his successor,\nLyndon B. Johnson, was a Southerner led most civil rights supporters to\nfeel that there would be a reversal of federal policies on the racial\nquestion. However, Johnson immediately tried to reassure the nation that\nhis intention was to carry on with the unfinished business of the Kennedy\nera. By the time the Bill passed in the spring of 1964, civil rights\nsupporters felt that Johnson was as dependable an ally as Kennedy had\nbeen. Instead of the vehement opposition to the public accommodations\nprovision of the Bill which had been expected, compliance was fairly\nwide-spread and came with relatively little opposition.\n\nIt soon became clear, however, that the passage of the Civil Rights Act\nwas not the victory which would end the racial conflict. In fact,\nviolence on both sides escalated. A Washington, D. C., Negro educator,\nLemuel Penn, was gunned down by snipers as he drove through Georgia on\nhis way home from a training session for reserve officers. Two Klansmen\nwere charged, but they were acquitted. In Philadelphia, Mississippi,\nthree civil rights workers--two white and one black--disappeared. The\nyouths were later found brutally murdered. In spite of national protests,\nlocal justice was not forthcoming.\n\nAt the same time, forewarnings of anger and violence had begun to rumble\nin many Afro-American communities across the land. In spite of the\nlegislative victories, most ghetto Negroes found that their daily lives\nhad not changed. In fact, the economic gap between blacks and whites had\ntended to increase as whites received the benefits of prosperity in\nlarger portions than did the blacks. Also, many ghetto residents, whose\nlives were surrounded with crime and violence, were further angered when\nthey watched the evening news showing their Southern brothers kicked and\nclubbed by sheriffs. These ghetto residents had not been schooled in the\ntactics of nonviolent resistance. In the summer of 1964, race riots\noccurred in Harlem and Rochester, N.Y., as well as in several cities in\nNew Jersey.\n\nIn the spring of 1965, Selma, Alabama, was the scene of a concentrated\nvoter registration drive. The campaign was once again spearheaded by\nMartin Luther King and the S.C.L.C. During the demonstrations, a Black\ncivil rights worker and a Northern Unitarian clergyman were both killed.\nFinally, a gigantic march was planned between Selma and the state capitol\nat Montgomery.  State officials sought to prohibit the march. The U. S.\nDistrict Judge at Montgomery, however, ordered officials to permit the\nmarch and to provide protection for the marchers. President Johnson\nfederalized the Alabama National Guard and used it to guarantee the\nmaintenance of law and order. When the procession reached the state\ncapitol building, the demonstrators were addressed by two Afro-American\nNobel Peace Prize winners. Ralph Bunche, who had received the award for\nmediating the Middle Eastern crisis, lamented the fact that he had to\naddress an audience while standing under a Confederate flag. Dr. Martin\nLuther King, Jr., who had just received the award himself for his work in\nnonviolent resistance, told the marchers to take heart because they were\non the road to victory:\n\n\"We are on the move now. The burning of our churches will not deter us.\nWe are on the move now. The bombing of our homes will not dissuade us.\nWe are on the move now. The beating and killing of our clergymen and\nyoung people will not divert us. We are on the move now. The arrest and\nrelease of known murderers will not discourage us, We are on the move now.\n\n\"Like an idea whose time has come, not even the marching of mighty armies\ncan halt us. We are moving to the land of freedom.\n\n\"Let us therefore continue our triumph and march to the realization of\nthe American dream. Let us march on segregated housing, until every\nghetto of social and economic depression dissolves and Negroes and whites\nlive side by side in decent, safe and sanitary housing.\n\n\"Let us march on segregated schools until every vestige of a segregated\nand inferior education becomes a thing of the past and Negroes and whites\nstudy side by side in the socially healing context of the classroom.\n\n\"Let us march on poverty, until no American parent has to skip a meal so\nthat their children may march on poverty, until no starved man walks the\nstreets of our cities and towns in search of jobs that do not exist.\n\n\"Let us march on ballot boxes, march on ballot boxes until race baiters\ndisappear from the political arena. Let us march on ballot boxes until\nthe Wallaces of our nation tremble away in silence.\n\n\"Let us march on ballot boxes, until we send to our city councils, state\nlegislatures, and the United States Congress men who will not fear to do\njustice, love mercy, and walk humbly with their God. Let us march on\nballot boxes until all over Alabama God's children will be able to walk\nthe earth in decency and honor.\n\n\"For all of us today the battle is in our hands. The road ahead is not\naltogether a smooth one. There are no broad highways to lead us easily\nand inevitably to quick solutions. We must keep going.\"\n\nLater that evening, a white woman from Detroit was shot and killed on the\nhighway between Montgomery and Selma as she was ferrying marchers back\nhome.\n\nPresident Johnson sent a new voting rights bill to Congress which gave\nsweeping powers to the Attorney General's office allowing it to send\nfederal registrars into localities to register voters when local\nofficials were either unable or unwilling to do so. In the course of a\ntelevision appearance in which Johnson announced this legislation and in\nwhich he expressed his own indignation at the events in Selma and\nMontgomery, he acknowledged the impact of demonstrations in pushing both\nthe country and the Congress into taking positive action to remedy\ninjustices. He implied that, while he did not always approve of the\nmethods used, the demonstrators had done a positive service for justice\nand for the country. He promised to see the fight through to the end, and\nhe said that it was the obligation of all good men to see that the battle\nwas fought in the courts and through the legislative process rather than\nforcing it into the streets. He ended his speech by quoting the lead line\nfrom the popular civil rights hymn, \"We Shall Overcome.\"\n\nBy 1965, the Federal Government had enacted legislation guaranteeing\nalmost all the citizenship rights of America to Negroes and had also\nprovided mechanisms with which to enforce this legislation.\nNevertheless, the passage of a bill in Washington did not immediately\nsecure the same right in Selma, Montgomery, or in Philadelphia,\nMississippi. Each right, so it seemed, had to be fought for and won over\nand over again in almost each locality. Although discrimination continued\nand even seemed to intensify at times, it no longer carried with it the\nforce of law. The Civil Rights Movement had, no matter what its critics\nsaid of it, accomplished one sweeping victory--the destruction of legal\nsegregation in the United States.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\nThe Black Revolt\n\n\nCivil Disorders\n\nThe smoldering tensions and frustrations which lay just below the surface\nin the Afro-American community exploded into a racial holocaust on August\n11, 1965, in Watts--a black ghetto just outside of Los Angeles. When the\nsmoke finally subsided several days later, more than thirty people were\ndead, hundreds had been injured, and almost four thousand had been\narrested. Property damage ran into the millions.\n\nThe nation was shocked. The mass communications media tended to\nexaggerate the amount of damage done and also conjured up visions, in the\nmind of white America, of organized black gangs deliberately and\nsystematically attacking white people. Many felt that it had been the\nworst racial outbreak in American history. In fact, it was not. The 1943\nriot in Detroit and the 1919 riot in Chicago had both been more violent.\nThe 1917 race riots in East St. Louis, Illinois, had outdone the Watts\noutburst in terms of the amount of personal injury. The violence in most\nprevious riots had been inflicted by whites against blacks, and perhaps\nthis was why white America did not remember them very clearly. The\nviolence in Watts, though not directed against white persons as many\nbelieved, was still accomplished by blacks and aimed against white-owned\nproperty. White Americans were confused because they felt they had given\n\"them\" so much. Whites could not understand why blacks were not thankful\ninstead of being angry.\n\nIn spite of the rumors that the riot was the result of conspiratorial\nplanning, the activities of the rioters and of the law enforcement units\ndisplayed a crazy, unreal quality as the riot unfolded. It began with a\nrather routine arrest for drunken driving. Marquette Frye, a young black,\nwas stopped by a white motorcycle officer and asked to take a standard\nsobriety test. In the course of arresting Frye, along with his brother\nand mother who were both objecting to the police action, the officers\nresorted to more force than many of the bystanders thought was necessary.\nThe spectators became transformed into a hostile mob. As the police cars\ndeparted, youths began to pelt the vehicles with rocks and bottles. They\ncontinued to harass other traffic passing through the area. For a time,\nthe police stayed outside the area, hoping that it would cool down. Then,\nbelieving that it was time to restore order, a line of police charged\ndown the street clearing the mob. The police clubbed and beat anyone who\ndid not get out of the way.  The guilty usually ran the fastest, and the\ninnocent and the physically disabled received most of the punishment.\nInstead of clearing the mob, the police charge only served to further\nanger the bystanders.\n\nThe rage of the black ghetto had been accumulating against all the\nsymbols of oppression. The police, of course, were the most obvious and\nvisible manifestation of this power, and in a riot they were one of the\nmost convenient targets for the rioters. Newsmen and firemen also became\nvictims of rock and bottle throwing. White-owned stores throughout the\nghettoes formed another target for this anger. Before long, rioters were\nbreaking into stores and carrying off everything from beer to television\nsets and clothing. Breaking and looting was shortly followed by burning.\nThe center of the action was soon nicknamed \"Charcoal Alley.\"\n\nAfter a couple of days when the riot continued to grow, Los Angeles\nofficials began to consider calling in the National Guard. Police Chief\nParker did not know that it was necessary for him to contact the\nGovernor's office and ask the Governor to call out the Guard.\nUnfortunately, Governor Brown was in Greece. The Lieutenant Governor was\nafraid to make such an important decision on his own initiative.\nFinally, Los Angeles officials phoned Governor Brown in Athens, and he\ngave his authority for calling out the Guard.\n\nBy the time the Guard arrived, all of Watts was covered with billowing\nclouds of smoke. The looting and burning were no longer confined to\nroving gangs of youths. Angry adults, who had previously only urged them\non, had become intoxicated by the mood of destruction. People of all\nages, many of whom had had no previous police record, began to join. The\npressure chamber had blown its valve and was now letting off steam. Watts\nabandoned itself to an emotional orgy.\n\nThe National Guard had not been adequately trained to handle civil\ndisorders. It also came with a point of view which was unsuited to a\ncivilian outburst. They had been trained to work against an enemy, and\nhad a tendency to interpret every action in this way and to view all the\nresidents of Watts as enemies. When two drunks in a car refused to stop\nat a Guard roadblock and ran into a line of soldiers, the Guard\ninterpreted it as a deliberate and malicious suicide attack. The Guard\nwas convinced that they were being personally threatened, and the\nofficers issued live ammunition to all the men.\n\nBy the end of the riot, the Guard had fired thousands of rounds of\nammunition. The press portrayed Watts as an armed camp with scores of\nblack snipers systematically trying to pick off the police and the Guard.\nIn retrospect, both the police and the Guard came to believe that most of\nthe snipers had really been the police and the Guardsmen unknowingly\nshooting at each other. When all of the evidence was examined in the calm\nlight of day, very little of it pointed to the existence of snipers.\nGradually, the Guard gained confidence in itself and in the situation.\nThe more that it acted in calm and deliberation, the more quickly peace\nwas restored to the area. Finally, eleven days after the Frye arrest the\nlast members of the Guard withdrew, and the next day the police returned\nto normal duty.\n\nIn the light of the victories of the Civil Rights Movement, whites were\nbewildered by the anger which exploded from the black ghetto.  They\nthought of their concessions to blacks as gifts from a generous heart.\nBlacks, to the contrary, viewed these concessions as the tardy surrender\nof rights which should have been theirs all along. Moreover, the effects\nof the civil rights victories had been largely limited to the Deep South\nand almost entirely to changes in legal status. The day-to-day realities\nof education, housing, employment, and social degradation had hardly been\ntouched. Finally, life in an urban ghetto, though lacking the humiliation\nof legal segregation, had brought another harsh reality into\nAfro-American life. Survival for the individual as well as for the family\ncame under fresh stress in urban slum situations. This had also been true\nfor immigrant groups from Europe. Urban slum conditions created\ntremendous economic, social, and psychological strains. Ghetto life added\na new dimension of social disorganization to an already oppressed\ncommunity. The anonymity of life in large urban centers tended to remove\nmany of the social constraints to individual behavior. Crime and\ndelinquency increased.  Actually, America had been deluded by the Civil\nRights Movement into thinking that genuine changes were taking place for\nmost Afro-Americans. Watts became a living proclamation that this was not\ntrue.\n\nEarly in 1967, violence began to reverberate throughout the ghettoes all\nacross the nation. The earliest disturbances occurred at three Southern\nuniversities. Then, violence exploded in Tampa, Florida, in June. The\nfollowing day, June 12, Cincinnati, Ohio, experienced a racial outburst.\nOn June 17, violence began in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nThe worst riots of that long hot summer occurred in Newark, New Jersey,\nand in Detroit, Michigan, during the month of July. Racial hostilities in\nNewark had been boiling for several months. In spite of the black\nmajority in Newark, a predominantly white political machine still ran\nCity Hall. Blacks were only given token recognition. The event which\nactually triggered the riot was, again, a relatively meaningless arrest.\nBystanders assumed, probably mistakenly, that the black taxi driver who\nwas being arrested, was also being beaten by the arresting officer. Bit\nby bit, again in a crazy pattern, the fires of frustration flared\nthroughout the city. At almost the same time, ghetto violence began to\nrock several other northern New Jersey communities: Elizabeth, Englewood,\nPlainfield, and New Brunswick.\n\nLooting and burning began to occur in Newark on a wide-scale basis.\nBefore long, the Guard was called in, and the shooting increased. The\nchief of staff of the New Jersey National Guard testified that there had\nbeen too much shooting at the snipers. His opinion was that the Guard\nconsidered the situation as a military action. Newark's director of\npolice offered the opinion that the Guard may have been shooting at the\npolice with the police shooting back at the Guard. \"I really don't\nbelieve,\" he said, \"there was as much sniping as we thought.\"\n\nBy the time the shooting had ended, twenty-three people had been killed.\nOf these, one was a white detective, one was a white fireman, and\ntwenty-one were Negroes. Of the twenty-one Negroes killed, six were\nwomen, two were children, and one was an elderly man seventy-three years\nold. The Kerner Report also stated, as did the New Jersey report on the\nriot, that there had been considerable evidence that the police and the\nGuard had been deliberately shooting into stores containing \"soul\nbrother\" signs. Instead of merely quelling a riot or attacking rioters,\nsome of them were apparently exploiting the situation to vent their own\nracial hatreds.\n\nThe violence in Detroit exploded on July 22. Again, it unfolded in an\nirrational, nightmarish fashion. The police had been making some rather\nroutine raids on five illegal after-hours drinking spots. At the last\ntarget, they were overwhelmed to find eighty-two \"in-mates.\" They needed\nover an hour in which to arrest and remove all of them.  This created\nconsiderable local disturbance and attracted an ever-growing crowd of\nonlookers.\n\nIn Detroit, the black community had been upset for some time by what it\nbelieved had been a selective enforcement of certain laws aimed at them.\nApparently, many of the observers believed that these raids were intended\nto harass the black community. Small-scale looting and violence began.\nAfter sputtering and flaring for a few hours, the riot began to grow and\nspread rapidly. By that night, the National Guard was activated.\n\nBy Monday morning, the Mayor and the Governor had asked for federal help.\nThe Governor had the impression that, in order to secure it, he would\nhave to declare a state of insurrection. He was further led to believe\nthat such an action would mean that insurance companies would not pay for\nany damage. For this reason, he refused to act. All day, burning and\nlooting continued and grew. Shooting became increasingly widespread, and\nthe number of deaths began to soar rapidly. Finally, before midnight on\nMonday, President Johnson sent in federal troops on his own initiative.\n\nWhen the federal troops arrived, they found the city full of fear. The\nArmy believed that its first task was one of maintaining its own order\nand discipline. Second, it strove to establish a rapport between the\ntroops and the citizens as a basis on which to build an atmosphere of\ncalm, trust, and order. The soldiers provided coffee and sandwiches to\nthe beleaguered residents, and an atmosphere of trust gradually developed.\n\nIt became clear that the mutual fear between the police and the citizens\nhad only intensified the catastrophe. Lessons which had been learned two\nyears earlier in Watts by the police and the Guard had not been applied\nin Detroit. Law enforcement officials again overreacted and used\nhigh-powered military weapons in a crowded civilian situation.  This\noverreaction presented as much danger to innocent, law-abiding citizens\nas did the violence of the rioters. There had also been a tendency to\ntreat the residents, en masse, as enemies and thereby to weld them into a\nhostile community. The federal troops demonstrated that a calm,\ndeliberate, and open display of force was much more effective in\nrestoring order than shooting at any frightening or suspicious target.\n\nBy the time order was restored to Detroit, forty-three people had been\nkilled. Thirty-three were black, and ten were white. One Guardsman and\none fireman were among the casualties. Some of the other white victims\nhad been killed while they were engaged in looting. Damages were\noriginally estimated at five hundred million dollars, but later estimates\nreduced the damage drastically.\n\nAgain, as in Newark, there was evidence of police brutality during the\nriot. The police were charged with brutality and murder in an incident\nwhich occurred at the Algiers Motel. After hearing that there had been a\nsniper in the building, the police riddled it with bullets. Then, they\nentered and searched it. In the course of questioning its inhabitants,\nthree youths were shot and killed.\n\nIn turn, the police and the Guard accused the rioters of widespread\nsniping. Twenty-seven rioters were charged with sniping, but twenty-two\nof these charges were dropped at the preliminary hearings for lack of\nevidence. Later, one pleaded guilty to possessing an unregistered gun,\nand he received a suspended sentence.\n\nPresident Johnson appointed a commission, headed by Governor Otto Kerner\nof Illinois to investigate the causes of the riots. In particular, he\nwished to ascertain whether any subversive or conspiratorial elements\nwere involved. Although many did not like the report, particularly\nbecause of the blame it laid on the white community, it clearly proved\nthat there had been no subversive or conspiratorial elements in these\nriots. The report warned that America was splitting into two nations: one\nblack and one white. It believed that racism and hatred were growing\ndeeper and that communication between the two communities was breaking\ndown. The Commission made several recommendations for change in\ngovernment, business, and society at large. These changes, however, would\nbe very expensive.  Government at all levels largely ignored the report.\nLiberals applauded it.  Blacks felt that it was merely another report;\nthey wanted action.  Conservatives claimed that it was a prejudiced and\nunfair study.\n\nIn April of 1968, another rash of riots swept through the Afro-American\ncommunity. This time there was a clear and obvious cause. Dr. Martin\nLuther King, Jr., who was visiting Memphis in support of a garbage\nworkers' strike, was leaning over his motel's second-floor balcony\nrailing talking to a colleague below when suddenly he was struck by a\nsniper's bullet and killed. Shock and outrage swept across the nation.\nMany Afro-Americans felt that they had been robbed of a friend as well as\nof their only hope for a better future.\n\nRobert Kennedy took to the campaign trail for the 1968 Presidential\nelection in order to bring justice to the poor, both black and white, and\nin order to reunite America behind a new sense of purpose and idealism.\nIn June, after a rally in Los Angeles, he too was shot and killed. The\nnation was filled with horror and disbelief. Robert Kennedy had gained\nthe trust of Afro-Americans more than almost any other white man of his\ngeneration. Violence seemed to reign supreme, and idealists, both black\nand white, were paralyzed by a feeling of futility.\n\n\nBlack Power\n\nEven before the assassination of Martin Luther King, the Civil Rights\nMovement was disintegrating. Many believed that it was being killed by\nthe riots. In fact, the Civil Rights Movement had already come under\nsharp attack both from within and from without. The urban riots of the\nsixties, instead of being the cause of its demise, were symptoms of the\ndisease in the urban, Afro-American communities--a disease for which the\nCivil Rights Movement had not been able to effect a cure. In retrospect,\nit appears that there had always been voices from within the\nAfro-American community which had maintained that the Civil Rights\nMovement was not the panacea that many believed it to be. To the\ncontrary, militant blacks maintained that the Civil Rights Movement\nitself was one of the primary causes of the urban riots. Stokeley\nCarmichael pointed out:\n\n\"Each time the people ... saw Martin Luther King get slapped, they became\nangry; when they saw four little black girls bombed to death, they were\nangrier; and when nothing happened, they were steaming. We had nothing to\noffer that they could see, except to go out and be beaten again. We\nhelped to build their frustration.\"\n\nAs early as 1957, Robert F. Williams, then the N.A.A.C.P. leader in\nMonroe, North Carolina, concluded that nonviolence could not be looked\nupon as a cure-all for all the problems of the Afro-American community.\nIn his opinion the right for an Afro-American to sit in the front of the\nbus in Montgomery was not so spectacular a victory:\n\n\"The Montgomery bus boycott was a victory--but it was limited. It did not\nraise the Negro standard of living; it did not mean better education for\nNegro children, it did not mean economic advances.\"\n\nWilliams compared the Montgomery boycott to an incident in Monroe:\n\n\"It's just like our own experience in Monroe when we integrated the\nlibrary. I just called the chairman of the board in my county. I told him\nthat I represented the NAACP, that we wanted to integrate the library,\nand that our own library had burned down. And he said, 'Well, I don't see\nany reason why you can't use the same library that our people use. It\nwon't make any difference. And after all, I don't read anyway.'\"\n\nWilliams claimed that a racist social system existed because the violence\nat the heart of that system went unchallenged. Violence was an integral\npart of the racial system, and it had not been introduced into the system\nby Afro-Americans.\n\n\"It is precisely this unchallenged violence that allows a racist social\nsystem to perpetuate itself. When people say that they are opposed to\nNegroes 'resorting to violence' what they really mean is that they are\nopposed to Negroes defending themselves and challenging the exclusive\nmonopoly of violence practiced by white racists. We have shown in Monroe\nthat with violence working both ways constituted law will be more\ninclined to keep the peace.\"\n\nWilliams urged Monroe Negroes to carry guns and other weapons and to\ndefend themselves when attacked. He defended his position by invoking the\nteachings of Henry Thoreau who had also been used as an authority by the\npacifists. Although Thoreau usually supported pacifism, according to\nWilliams, Thoreau also believed that there were occasions which justified\nviolence. Thoreau, who had defended John Brown's attack on Harpers Ferry,\nhad made the statement that guns, for once, had been used for a righteous\ncause and were being held in righteous hands. In integrating his theory\nin regard to self-defense with the teachings of Thoreau, Williams was\nobviously attacking the philosophy of nonviolent resistance taught by\nMartin Luther King who also drew on Thoreau.\n\nEven during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement, in the background\nthere was a constant, irritating opposition. While the movement grew, the\nBlack Muslims also grew. Not only did they challenge the tactics of\nnonviolent resistance, they disagreed totally with its goals. While\nElijah Muhammed constantly opposed aggression, he did preach the need for\nself-defense. To him it was not necessary for a man to turn the other\ncheek when he was hit. He also ridiculed the Civil Rights goal of\nintegration. Instead of losing themselves in white America, Muslims\nbelieved in finding their own identity and in maintaining a separate\nsociety. They claimed that blacks should not be ashamed of either their\ncolor or their heritage. They taught that the black man had had a history\nof which to be proud. The sense of self-acceptance and pride which they\ntaught came as good news to ghetto residents who realized that they could\nnever be assimilated into white, middle-class America.\n\nWith the conversion of Malcolm Little, better known as Malcolm X, the\nMuslims gained a dynamic speaker who did much to popularize and spread\ntheir teaching. Although the peculiar doctrines and puritanical practices\nof the Muslims prevented many from joining the movement, the number of\nits sympathizers grew rapidly. Malcolm X was able to appeal to ghetto\nresidents in a way that Martin Luther King could not.\n\nKing, obviously, had had all the advantages of a middle-class home.\nMalcolm, however, had started at the bottom, and ghetto residents could\nreadily identify with him. King had gone to college and had even earned a\ndoctorate. Malcolm gained his reputation \"hustling\" on the streets of\nBoston and New York and also from teaching himself while serving a\nsentence in prison.\n\nIn 1964 Malcolm X was forced to break with Elijah Muhammed.  Apparently,\nElijah Muhammed had become threatened by Malcolm's charismatic appeal,\nand he feared he might lose his leadership in the movement. After a\npilgrimage to Mecca as well as visits to several newly independent\nAfrican nations, Malcolm returned to America ready to start a movement of\nhis own. Although he believed more strongly than ever in Islam, he came\nto feel that several of the teachings of the Black Muslims were\nerroneous. One reason was that in Mecca he had worshipped with people\nfrom all races. As a result, he no longer felt that the white man, per\nse, was the \"devil\":\n\n\"In the past, yes, I have made sweeping indictments of all white people.\nI never will be guilty of that again--as I know now that some white\npeople are truly sincere, that some truly are capable of being brotherly\ntoward a black man. The true Islam has shown me that a blanket indictment\nof all white people is as wrong as when whites make blanket indictments\nagainst blacks.\"\n\nMalcolm intended to continue teaching Islam in America, and he insisted\nthat a religious faith was a help to any political movement.\nNevertheless, he also intended to form a secular organization which could\nappeal to a wide variety of persons, and form the center of a new black\nmilitancy. Before any of these activities could get under way he was\nkilled. Malcolm X was gunned down by four blacks, probably associated\nwith the Black Muslims, while addressing a meeting in New York City early\nin 1965.\n\nTo Malcolm X the Civil Rights Movement was in need of a new\ninterpretation. The degree of segregation existing in schools and in the\nrest of society, he contended, had actually increased in the decade since\nthe Supreme Court decision in 1954. It seemed to him to be particularly\ntrue in the case of the de facto segregation practiced in the North. The\nspirit of the Civil Rights Movement, he pointed out, had been one of\nasking and pleading for rights which should have belonged to\nAfro-Americans by birth:\n\n\"I said that the American black man needed to recognize that he had a\nstrong, airtight case to take the United States before the United Nations\non a formal accusation of 'denial of human rights'--and that if Angola\nand South Africa were precedent cases, then there would be no easy way\nthat the U.S. could escape being censured, right on its own home ground.\"\n\nMalcolm was also critical of the Civil Rights Movement, contending that\nits interracial makeup and its emphasis on integration undercut the real\ngoals of the black masses. \"Not long ago,\" he said, \"the black man in\nAmerica was fed a dose of another form of the weakening, lulling and\ndeluding effects of so-called 'integration.' It was that 'Farce on\nWashington,' I call it.\"  Malcolm held that the famous March on\nWashington in 1963 had begun as a very angry, grass-roots movement among\npoor black people. He said that whites took it over and turned a genuine\nprotest into a sentimental, interracial picnic.\n\nFinally, Malcolm made it clear that he, too, was willing to resort to\nviolence although he did not favor initiating it. He held that, when the\nrights of blacks were violated, they should be willing to die in the\nstruggle to secure them:\n\n\"If white America doesn't think the Afro-American, especially the\nupcoming generation, is capable of adopting the guerrilla tactics now\nbeing used by oppressed people elsewhere on this earth, she is making a\ndrastic mistake. She is underestimating the force that can do her the\nmost harm.\n\n\"A real honest effort to remove the just grievances of the 22 million\nAfro-Americans must be made immediately or in a short time it will be too\nlate.\"\n\nThe slogan \"Black Power\" exploded from a public address system in\nGreenwood, Mississippi, in the summer of 1966, and as it reverberated\nacross America Stokeley Carmichael's motto spontaneously took on the\ndimensions of a movement. James Meredith, who had become famous for\ninitiating federally backed integration of the University of Mississippi,\nwas making a one-man freedom march across the South. He sought to\ndemonstrate that blacks could walk through the South without fear. When\nhe was shot, civil rights leaders from across the land felt compelled to\ncontinue his demonstration.\n\nMartin Luther King representing S.C.L.C., Floyd McKissick from C.O.R.E.,\nStokeley Carmichael of S.N.C.C. and several others discussed the meaning\nand direction of the movement as they marched along the road by day and\nas they sat together in motels at night. Their discussion became a heated\ndebate about both the tactics and the goals of their struggle. McKissick\nand Carmichael questioned the worth of nonviolence as a tactic and the\nvalue of integration as a goal. When the marchers reached Greenwood,\nMississippi, a S.N.C.C. stronghold, Carmichael seized the microphone, and\ninstead of using the traditional civil rights slogan of \"Freedom Now\" he\nbegan chanting \"Black Power!\"\n\nMany whites assumed that the phrase meant black violence, and they\nassumed further that black violence meant black aggression. They conjured\nup pictures of bloody retaliation. Others saw it as a rejection of white\nallies, and they insisted that the freedom struggle could not be won\nwithout white help. To Carmichael, the Civil Rights Movement as it\nexisted was \"pleading and begging.\" It also had been wrong, he said, in\nassuming it was possible to build a working coalition between a group\nwhich was strong and economically secure--middle-class white\nliberals--and one which was insecure--poor blacks. In his opinion, \"there\nis in fact no group at present with whom to form a coalition in which\nblacks will not be absorbed and betrayed.\" Two such differing groups had\ndifferent sets of self-interest in spite of their similar sentiments.\nCarmichael contended that a genuine coalition had to be built between\ngroups with similar self interests.  Further, he argued that each group\nmust have its own independent base of power from which to negotiate the\nterms of a working alliance. Black power, he said, was an attempt to\nbuild the strength on which future coalitions could be established.\n\nCarmichael also attacked the concept of integration. If blacks wanted\ngood housing or good education, integration meant leaving a black\nneighborhood and finding these things in white institutions. \"This\nreinforces, among both black and white,\" he argued, \"the idea that\n'white' is automatically better and 'black' is by definition inferior.\nThis is why integration is a subterfuge for the maintenance or white\nsupremacy.\"  If blacks could gain control of their own neighborhoods,\neach community, black and white, could define its own goals and be\nresponsible for achieving its own standards. When both societies had\nbuilt the kind of communities they wanted, meaningful integration between\nequal, though different, communities could occur, Carmichael contended.\nIntegration, instead of being a one-way street, would be reciprocal.\n\nCarmichael believed the existing political structure must be changed in\norder to overcome racism:\n\n\"'Political modernization' includes many things, but we mean by it three\nmajor concepts: (1) questioning old values and institutions of the\nsociety; (2) searching for new and different forms of political structure\nto solve political and economic problems; and (3) broadening the base of\npolitical participation to include more people in the decision-making\nprocess.\"\n\nBlack power meant two things: the end of shame and humiliation, and black\ncommunity control. Blacks should be proud of being black, and they should\nbe proud of their African past. Instead of using skin lighteners and hair\nstraighteners, black power advocates began adopting a style of dress with\nan African flavor. To Carmichael there was still one other aspect to the\nblack power philosophy. It should accentuate human values and human\ndignity. The prevailing system, besides being racist, put a primary\nemphasis on property rather than on humanity.  Carmichael wanted the\nblack-controlled community to act for the benefit of all blacks and not\nmerely for the advantage of a handful of exploiting black capitalists.\n\nWhat he advocated was the development of black cooperatives, not the\nbuilding of black capitalism. He referred to this new political system as\n\"political modernization.\" Its key was community, cooperative control of\nall the important things in people's lives. In addition to building a\nmore participatory kind of democratic government, and developing\ncooperative enterprises, it meant that people renting houses or\napartments must have rights and protection. He encouraged consumers and\napartment dwellers to develop organizations which could fight for their\nspecial interests. He also wanted the community to gain local control of\nits police force.\n\nThe black power ideology spread across the nation rapidly, providing the\nmovement with fresh impetus and a philosophical framework. Many had lost\nfaith in the effectiveness of marches, demonstrations, appeals to white\nconsciences and other direct action techniques. Black Americans were also\ngrowing weary and frustrated over the amount of violence which was being\nheaped upon nonviolent resisters. In Bogalusa, Louisiana, blacks were\nintimidated daily by the local Ku Klux Klan. Law enforcement officials\nnever provided help either in terms of protection or in prosecuting\nwrongdoers. In fact, the law enforcement officials themselves were\nincreasingly suspected of belonging to the Klan.  Bogalusa blacks came to\nfeel that arming themselves for self-defense was their only solution. In\n1966 a number of them armed themselves, and founded the Deacons for\nDefense and Justice. Also in 1966, young blacks in Oakland, California,\nbecame extremely angry at what they believed to be police harassment.\nThis resulted in their forming the Black Panther Party.\n\nHuey P. Newton and Bobby Seale, both of whom had been raised under ghetto\nconditions, felt that there was a need for an organization which could\ncommunicate with poor blacks instead of merely appealing to the black\nbourgeoisie. The symbol of the black panther had been used by an\nindependent, black political party which S.N.C.C. had helped to found in\nLowndes County, Alabama.\n\nThe black panther had special appeal as a symbol because, though it\nrarely or never attacked another animal, it would defend itself\nferociously whenever it was challenged. In Oakland, the Black Panthers\nbegan by keeping the police under surveillance as a means of limiting\ntheir alleged brutality. Panther members carried registered guns and\ndisplayed them openly as the law permitted. Whenever the police stopped\nto question someone, the following Panther car also stopped.  Then, the\nPanthers would stand nearby displaying their weapons, and someone who had\nsome legal training, would inform the individual being questioned by the\npolice what his legal rights were. The police were extremely angry at\nthis harassment and looked for ways to retaliate.  The best-known Panther\nrecruit was Eldridge Cleaver who, like Malcolm X, had educated himself\nwhile in prison. Cleaver wrote several articles for Ramparts magazine,\nand became well known for his book Soul on Ice.  His vivid writing helped\nthe Panthers in spreading their ideas widely.  Gradually, chapters of the\nBlack Panther party were established in ghettoes all across America.\n\nBesides demanding legal rights for blacks, the Black Panthers developed a\nten-point program demanding decent jobs and decent housing. Also, arguing\nthat most black prisoners had been convicted in courts by people\nconspicuous for their racial prejudice, they advocated that all black\ninmates of American jails should immediately be released and granted\namnesty. Because blacks were not properly represented in the country and\nwere not treated fairly as citizens, the Panthers contended that they\nshould be exempted from all military service. Blacks fighting in the\nVietnam war, they pointed out, were represented in numbers above their\nnational proportion and were being used to fight a racist war against\ncolored people in Asia. Carmichael had previously made this same point\nand had popularized the motto, \"Hell No! We Won't Go!\"\n\nAlthough the Black Panthers believed in black power, they were willing to\ncooperate with some extremist whites, and they wanted the entire\npolitical system restructured to remove power from the rich and put it in\nthe hands of the masses of citizens. They expressed this teaching with\nthe slogans, \"All power to the people\" and \"Black power to the black\npeople.\" Eldridge Cleaver had also concluded that some young whites could\nbe trusted to support the black cause. He had been impressed with the\ncommitment of some of the white college students, especially those\nconnected with Students for a Democratic Society. He recognized that\nthere were some modern John Browns who could be depended on to help the\ncause. In the 1968 election, the Panthers joined with militant white\ngroups which were seeking both racial justice and an end to the war in\nVietnam and formed the Peace and Freedom Party. Although he was not old\nenough to meet the constitutional requirements, Eldridge Cleaver was\nnominated as the party's presidential candidate. In spite of the fact\nthat the Peace and Freedom Party received only a handful of votes, it was\na means of communicating its message to the American people.\n\nIn spite of President Nixon's appeal to the American people to \"lower\ntheir voices\" of protest so that they might better be heard, many\nbelieved that he only wanted quiet in order not to be disturbed. With\nNixon's election, black and white radicals felt that the white and\nconservative backlash had taken over the \"Establishment\" and that\nofficial repression was bound to follow. Vice President Agnew's\nanti-liberal attacks were taken by many as an expression of Nixon's\nfeelings which he preferred not to express himself.\n\nThe Black Panthers and the police became involved in a number of\nconfrontations or \"shoot-outs\" which the former believed to be the result\nof a nationally organized, official repression. The police, at the same\ntime, accused the Panthers of deliberately trying to kill \"pigs,\" the\nPanthers' name for the police, and the Panthers accused the police of\ndeliberately creating situations which would allow them to kill the\nPanther leadership. Before long, most of the Panther leaders were either\nunder arrest, had been killed, or had fled into exile to avoid being\narrested.\n\nAs civil disorders diminished in the ghettoes, college campuses were\nincreasingly rocked by student riots. In part, it was because students\nasked for changes in the university structure. Black students demanded\nthat courses in black studies be initiated and that colleges aggressively\nrecruit new black students even if their grades were below admission\nstandards. Some urban schools, like Columbia University, were accused by\nblack and white students of diminishing the housing of ghetto residents\nto make the university's expansion possible. Other campus riots were\naimed against the war in Vietnam. In May of 1970, when President Nixon\nsent American troops into Cambodia supposedly in the process of\nde-escalating the war in Vietnam, protests spread all across the country,\nand several campuses exploded with riots.\n\nAt Kent State University in Ohio, the National Guard shot and killed four\nwhite student protesters. At Jackson State in Mississippi, the police\nkilled two black students. Campus riots escalated, and dozens of colleges\nand universities were compelled to close their doors for the remainder of\nthe academic year. While some Americans felt that these killings were a\nresult of government repression of the freedom of speech, others believed\nthat more action of this kind was necessary to curb what they viewed as\nextremist protest. Blacks again noticed that it had been the death of\nfour white students which brought forth the widespread indignation. They\nbelieved that killings of blacks by police and Guardsmen were usually\ntaken for granted or ignored. Even liberals, they believed, were only\nreally stirred by repressive measures aimed against whites.\n\nWhen the Nixon Administration still refused to change its policies in\nresponse to these violent confrontations, radicals turned increasingly to\nthe use of terrorist violence. Bombings had been on the increase for a\ncouple of years, and during the summer of 1970, they became even more\nfrequent. But the walls of the Establishment still did not come tumbling\ndown. Members of the Panthers, S.N.C.C., and the Weathermen--the\nleft-wing of the Students for a Democratic Society--were generally\nthought to be responsible for much of this terrorism. Instead of rallying\nfresh supporters to the cause of the radical left, their terrorism only\nserved to alienate other moderates and radicals. Although the violence of\nthis left fringe increased, their numbers appeared to decrease, and\nbecause of this the terrorist fringe began to reevaluate its tactics and\nthe whole situation.\n\nIn February of 1971, when the Army of South Vietnam crossed into Laos\nwith heavy American air support, campuses across the country remained\nquiet. At the same time, when Bobby Seale of the Black Panthers was\nbrought to trial for allegedly participating in the murder of an\nex-Panther, only a handful of spectators attended the opening of his\ntrial. A year before when another Panther had gone on trial for his\nalleged involvement in the same crime, New Haven, Connecticut,\nexperienced a series of demonstrations which culminated in a mass protest\nmeeting of some fifteen thousand people.\n\nBy early 1971, terrorism, violent confrontation, and peaceful protests\nhad withered considerably. Pessimism, cynicism, and despair were\nwidespread, and many advocates of change had become paralyzed by\nfutility, but neither black nor white protesters had surrendered to the\nstatus quo. Both groups were rethinking their attitudes. Instead of using\nmassive campaigns with mass media coverage, the Movement had switched its\nemphasis to the routine, day-by-day organization of support. In 1966 the\nBlack Power Movement had contained more rhetoric than power. In 1971 it\nwas still alive, but blacks were working in practical ways, limiting\nthemselves to workable objectives. The Afro-American community was\nquietly building community organizations to create the economic and\npolitical foundations necessary for the future.  Mass protests and\nradical slogans, even when they received worldwide attention, had not had\nenough muscle to change power relationships.  Afro-Americans, then,\nturned to the more grueling and inglorious job of trying to put their\ntheories into practice.\n\n\n\nEpilogue\n\n\nWhat insights can the study of history bring to the understanding and\nsolution of the American racial situation? How can the knowledge of\nyesterday's events help us to face tomorrow's decisions? The fact is,\nwhether we know it or not, that the past is always with us and clings\ntightly to us like a cloak. We have the choice of either recognizing it\nand dealing constructively with it or of ignoring it and remaining in\nbondage to it.\n\nThe heritage of the American slave system is still part of our lives.\nRacial attitudes of white superiority and black inferiority became an\nintegral part of the American cultural climate, and it is still part of\nthe air we all breathe. All Americans, black and white, inhale and\nassimilate more racism than we care to admit. Denying that we are still\ninfected by prejudice, however, does not help us to deal creatively with\nit. The drive to create a black identity which can be worn with pride and\nthe emergence of independent African nations already have made a\nsignificant impact in altering American racial stereotypes.\n\nHistory is one of the disciplines concerned with understanding how social\nprocesses operate. On this point, the study of Afro-American history\nraises a particular question about the means of social change.  There\nhave been those who sought to achieve it through appeals to conscience\nand idealism, others have turned to the use of physical force, and there\nhave also been those who worked for it through mobilizing economic and\npolitical power.\n\nThe black experience in the United States leaves one either disillusioned\nor cynical concerning the value of conscience and idealism in erasing\nAmerican racism. These factors, however, have not been totally\nirrelevant. The American democratic creed has prevented the nation from\nbuilding a permanent legal caste system based on color.  As a legal\nstructure, Jim Crow lasted less than a century and was limited to the\nDeep South. Idealism has made it impossible for America to rest\ncomfortably while pursuing its racist policies.\n\nViolence is a tempting technique for the frustrated and angry. In fact,\nit often has accompanied rapid social change, but it is usually a\nby-product of shifting power relationships in society rather than the\ncause of change itself. Trusting in violence is a form of revolutionary\nromanticism, a seductive shortcut to other more basic kinds of social\npower. The history of the Black Panthers would seem to be an example of\nthis point. Their appeal to violence attracted angry youths who were\neager for quick results. Although the party gained a lot of publicity,\nand, in some quarters, received a lot of applause, its desire for rapid\nsuccess kept it from building a solid, mass base.  Apparently its leaders\nbelieved that violence made this kind of mobilization unnecessary. Its\npublicity and quick successes were superficial and failed to achieve\nbasic social transformation. On Wednesday, May 19, 1971, Huey Newton, the\nBlack Panther Minister of Defense, declared that the Panthers had been\nwrong in confronting the police: \"All we got was a war and a lot of\nbloodshed.\" He said that they had been mistaken in disregarding the\nchurch and in thinking that they could change things without the people's\nchanging them:\n\n\"We'll be criticized by the revolutionary cultists for trying to effect\nchange by stages, but to do all we want to do, we just have to go through\nall the stages of development. We cannot jump from A to Z as some\nthought.\"\n\nThroughout history almost all social transformations have been the result\nof shifts in basic power relationships. The attempt to build political\nand economic power on a nationwide basis within the black community is a\nrelatively new phenomenon. Reconstruction had attempted to do it earlier,\nbut it was destroyed before it could be tested.  Almost all other black\neconomic and political involvement has been dependent on sizable white\nsupport. This was true both of the policies of Booker T. Washington and\nof the Civil Rights Movement. In fact, this meant a reliance on white\npower and on white conscience. The new spirit of black pride and\nself-reliance along with the new voting rights has already created\npockets of black political strength in many Northern cities and in parts\nof the rural South. It is also being reflected in the Congress with the\nelection of more blacks and with their creation of the Black Caucus,\npresently consisting of thirteen black congressmen. After submitting a\nlist of their demands to President Nixon, their spokesman, Representative\nWilliam Clay, D-Mo., said:\n\n\"We are going to set the tone for the black liberation struggle in this\ncountry.... Black people in this country have no permanent friends, no\npermanent enemies, only permanent interests.... I think we've reached the\npoint in black America where we've completely given up on the mass\ndemonstrations, sit-ins and boycotts. We've come to the basic conclusion\nthat America has no conscience. Anybody who still appeals to what they\nthink is a conscience is either stupid or frustrated. The only possible\navenue for the achievement of equal rights for all in this country is\nthrough the exertion of political power. We have actual power, and even\ngreater potential power, more than we've ever had in history.\"\n\nAs Representative Clay maintains, striving for racial change through an\nappeal to conscience has been found woefully inadequate. The resort to\nphysical force has not been followed very often and, when it has, it has\nbeen used sporadically. To succeed, it obviously requires its own kind of\nmass power base to bring about lasting results. The creation of genuine\nblack political power which was preached in 1966 is only being achieved\nnow. It has already gained significant local results. In the Black\nCaucus, it promises broader national influence.  Trusting to white\nconsciences has been proven naive. Looking to terrorism for quick results\nhas only led to publicity and bloodshed.  Building genuine political\npower, however, is producing results now and promises to create more\nsocial transformation in the immediate future."
