Here are all the preprocessed files, at different stages:

1. **metadata/files/id.json** \
Contains the text files with some metadata, downloaded from Gutenberg.
2. **novel/id_novel.json** \
Contains the text files with NER performed on the whole novel, with positional indices for each entity.
3. **preproc/id_preproc.json** \
Contains the text files splitted into paragraphs, where entities and summaries are associated to each paragraph.

**raw/id.txt** contains raw text files that are not used in the main framework.
