Warwick Crescent.\nW.\n\nDec. 28. ‘86\n\nMy dear Dr. Corson,\n\nI waited some days after the arrival of your Book and Letter,\nthinking I might be able to say more of my sense of your goodness:\nbut I can do no more now than a week ago.  You “hope I shall not find\ntoo much to disapprove of”:  what I ought to protest against,\nis “a load to sink a navy--too much honor”:  how can I put aside\nyour generosity, as if cold justice--however befitting myself--\nwould be in better agreement with your nature?  Let it remain\nas an assurance to younger poets that, after fifty years’ work\nunattended by any conspicuous recognition, an over-payment may be made,\nif there be such another munificent appreciator as I have been\nprivileged to find, in which case let them, even if more deserving,\nbe equally grateful.\n\nI have not observed anything in need of correction in the notes.\nThe “little Tablet” was a famous “Last Supper”, mentioned by Vasari,\n(page. 232), and gone astray long ago from the Church of S. Spirito:\nit turned up, according to report, in some obscure corner,\nwhile I was in Florence, and was at once acquired by a stranger.\nI saw it, genuine or no, a work of great beauty.  (Page 156.)\n“A canon”, in music, is a piece wherein the subject is repeated--\nin various keys:  and being strictly obeyed in the repetition,\nbecomes the “Canon”--the imperative law--to what follows.\nFifty of such parts would be indeed a notable peal:\nto manage three is enough of an achievement for a good musician.\n\nAnd now,--here is Christmas:  all my best wishes go to you\nand Mrs Corson.  Those of my sister also.  She was indeed suffering\nfrom grave indisposition in the summer, but is happily recovered.\nI could not venture, under the circumstances, to expose\nher convalescence to the accidents of foreign travel:\nhence our contenting ourselves with Wales rather than Italy.\nShall you be again induced to visit us?  Present or absent,\nyou will remember me always, I trust, as\n\nYours most affectionately,\n\nRobert Browning.\n\n\n“Quanta subtilitate ipsa corda hominum reserat, intimos mentis\nrecessus explorat, varios animi motus perscrutatur.\nQuod ad tragoediam antiquiorem attinet, interpretatus est,\nuti nostis omnes, non modo Aeschylum quo nemo sublimior,\nsed etiam Euripidem quo nemo humanior; quo fit ut etiam illos\nqui Graece nesciunt, misericordia tangat Alcestis,\nterrore tangat Hercules.

E. Sandys, Public Orator at the University of Cambridge,\non presenting Mr. Browning for the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws,\nJune 10, 1879.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE.\n\n\nThe purpose of the present volume is to afford some aid and guidance\nin the study of Robert Browning’s Poetry, which, being the most\ncomplexly subjective of all English poetry, is, for that reason alone,\nthe most difficult.  And then the poet’s favorite art-form,\nthe dramatic, or, rather, psychologic, monologue, which is quite\noriginal with himself, and peculiarly adapted to the constitution\nof his genius and to the revelation of themselves by the several\n“dramatis personae”, presents certain structural difficulties,\nbut difficulties which, with an increased familiarity,\ngrow less and less.  The exposition presented in the Introduction,\nof its constitution and skilful management, and the Arguments given\nof the several poems included in the volume, will, it is hoped,\nreduce, if not altogether remove, the difficulties of this kind.\nIn the same section of the Introduction, certain peculiarities\nof the poet’s diction, which sometimes give a check to the reader’s\nunderstanding of a passage, are presented and illustrated.\n\nI think it not necessary to offer any apology for my going all the way\nback to Chaucer, and noting the Ebb and Flow in English Poetry\ndown to the present time, of the spirituality which constitutes\nthe real life of poetry, and which should, as far as possible,\nbe brought to the consciousness and appreciation of students.\nWhat I mean by spirituality is explained in my treatment\nof the subject.  The degree to which poetry is quickened with it\nshould always enter into an estimate of its absolute worth.\nIt is that, indeed, which constitutes its absolute worth.\nThe weight of thought conveyed, whatever that be, will not compensate\nfor the absence of it.\n\nThe study of poetry, in our institutions of learning, so far as I\nhave taken note of it, and the education induced thereby,\nare almost purely intellectual.  The student’s spiritual nature\nis left to take care of itself; and the consequence is that he becomes,\nat best, only a thinking and analyzing machine.\n\nThe spiritual claims of the study of poetry are especially demanded\nin the case of Browning’s poetry.  Browning is generally\nand truly regarded as the most intellectual of poets.\nNo poetry in English literature, or in any literature,\nis more charged with discursive thought than his.  But he is,\nat the same time, the most spiritual and transcendental of poets,\nthe “subtlest assertor of the Soul in Song”.  His thought is never\nan end to itself, but is always subservient to an ulterior\nspiritual end--always directed towards “a presentment of\nthe correspondency of the universe to Deity, of the natural to\nthe spiritual, and of the actual to the ideal”; and it is\nall-important that students should be awakened, and made,\nas far as possible, responsive to this spiritual end.\n\nThe sections of the Introduction on Personality and Art\nwere read before the Browning Society of London, in June, 1882.\nI have seen no reason for changing or modifying, in any respect,\nthe views therein expressed.\n\nThe idea of personality as a quickening, regenerating power,\nand the idea of art as an intermediate agency of personality,\nare, perhaps, the most reiterated (implicitly, not explicitly)\nin Browning’s poetry, and lead up to the dominant idea of Christianity,\nthe idea of a Divine Personality; the idea that the soul,\nto use an expression from his earliest poem, ‘Pauline’,\nmust “rest beneath some better essence than itself in weakness”.\n\nThe notes to the poems will be found, I trust, to cover all points\nand features of the text which require explanation and elucidation.\nI have not, at any rate, wittingly passed by any real difficulties.\nWhether my explanations and interpretations will in all cases\nbe acceptable, remains to be seen.\n\nHiram Corson.\n\nCascadilla Cottage, Ithaca, N.Y.\n\nSeptember, 1886.\n\n\n\nNote to the Second Edition.\n\nIn this edition, several errors of the first have been corrected.\nFor the notes on “fifty-part canon”, p. 156, and “a certain precious\nlittle tablet”, p. 232, I am indebted to Mr. Browning.\n\nH. C.\n\n{p. 156--in this etext, see line 322 of “The Flight of the Duchess”,\nin the Poems section.  p. 232--see Stanza 30 of “Old Pictures\nin Florence”, also in the Poems section.}\n\n\n\nNote to the Third Edition.\n\nIn this edition have been added, ‘A Death in the Desert’,\nwith argument, notes, and commentary, a fac-simile of a letter\nfrom the poet, and a portrait copied from a photograph\n(the last taken of him) which he gave me when visiting him in Venice,\na month before his death.\n\nIt may be of interest, and of some value, to many students\nof Browning’s poetry, to know a reply he made, in regard to\nthe expression in ‘My Last Duchess’, “I gave commands; then all smiles\nstopped together.”\n\nWe were walking up and down the great hall of the Palazzo Rezzonico,\nwhen, in the course of what I was telling him about the study\nof his works in the United States, I alluded to the divided opinion\nas to the meaning of the above expression in ‘My Last Duchess’,\nsome understanding that the commands were to put the Duchess to death,\nand others, as I have explained the expression on p. 87 of this volume\n(last paragraph).  {For etext use, section III (Browning’s Obscurity)\nof the Introduction, sixth paragraph before the end of the section.}\nHe made no reply, for a moment, and then said, meditatively, “Yes,\nI meant that the commands were that she should be put to death.”\n And then, after a pause, he added, with a characteristic dash\nof expression, and as if the thought had just started in his mind,\n“Or he might have had her shut up in a convent.”  This was to me\nvery significant.  When he wrote the expression, “I gave commands”,\netc., he may not have thought definitely what the commands were,\nmore than that they put a stop to the smiles of the sweet Duchess,\nwhich provoked the contemptible jealousy of the Duke.  This was all\nhis art purpose required, and his mind did not go beyond it.\nI thought how many vain discussions take place in Browning Clubs,\nabout little points which are outside of the range\nof the artistic motive of a composition, and how many minds\nare occupied with anything and everything under the sun,\nexcept the one thing needful (the artistic or spiritual motive),\nthe result being “as if one should be ignorant of nothing concerning\nthe scent of violets, except the scent itself.”\n\nH.C.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n\nPREFACE.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\n    I.

The Spiritual Ebb and Flow exhibited in English Poetry from Chaucer to Tennyson and Browning.\n\n\nLiterature, in its most restricted art-sense, is an expression\nin letters of the life of the spirit of man co-operating with\nthe intellect.  Without the co-operation of the spiritual man,\nthe intellect produces only thought; and pure thought,\nwhatever be the subject with which it deals, is not regarded\nas literature, in its strict sense.  For example, Euclid’s ‘Elements’,\nNewton’s ‘Principia’, Spinoza’s ‘Ethica’, and Kant’s\n‘Critique of the Pure Reason’, do not properly belong to literature.\n(By the “spiritual” I would be understood to mean the whole domain\nof the emotional, the susceptible or impressible, the sympathetic,\nthe intuitive; in short, that mysterious something in the constitution\nof man by and through which he holds relationship with\nthe essential spirit of things, as opposed to the phenomenal\nof which the senses take cognizance.)\n\nThe term literature is sometimes extended in meaning (and it may be\nso extended), to include all that has been committed to letters,\non all subjects.  There is no objection to such extension\nin ordinary speech, no more than there is to that of the signification\nof the word, “beauty” to what is purely abstract.  We speak,\nfor example, of the beauty of a mathematical demonstration;\nbut beauty, in its strictest sense, is that which appeals to\nthe spiritual nature, and must, therefore, be concrete, personal,\nnot abstract.  Art beauty is the embodiment, adequate,\neffective embodiment, of co-operative intellect and spirit,--\n“the accommodation,” in Bacon’s words, “of the shows of things\nto the desires of the mind.”\n\nIt follows that the relative merit and importance of different periods\nof a literature should be determined by the relative degrees\nof spirituality which these different periods exhibit.\nThe intellectual power of two or more periods, as exhibited\nin their literatures, may show no marked difference,\nwhile the spiritual vitality of these same periods may\nvery distinctly differ.  And if it be admitted that literature proper\nis the product of co-operative intellect and spirit (the latter being\nalways an indispensable factor, though there can be no high order\nof literature that is not strongly articulated, that is not\nwell freighted, with thought), it follows that the periods\nof a literature should be determined by the ebb and flow\nof spiritual life which they severally register, rather than\nby any other considerations.  There are periods which\nare characterized by a “blindness of heart”, an inactive,\nquiescent condition of the spirit, by which the intellect\nis more or less divorced from the essential, the eternal,\nand it directs itself to the shows of things.  Such periods may embody\nin their literatures a large amount of thought,--thought which is\nconversant with the externality of things; but that of itself\nwill not constitute a noble literature, however perfect\nthe forms in which it may be embodied, and the general sense\nof the civilized world, independently of any theories of literature,\nwill not regard such a literature as noble.  It is made up of what\nmust be, in time, superseded; it has not a sufficiently large element\nof the essential, the eternal, which can be reached only through\nthe assimilating life of the spirit.  The spirit may be\nso “cabined, cribbed, confined” as not to come to any consciousness\nof itself; or it may be so set free as to go forth and recognize\nits kinship, respond to the spiritual world outside of itself, and,\nby so responding, KNOW what merely intellectual philosophers\ncall the UNKNOWABLE.\n\nTo turn now to the line of English poets who may be said to have\npassed the torch of spiritual life, from lifted hand to hand,\nalong the generations.  And first is\n\n               “the morning star of song, who made\n     His music heard below:\n\n     “Dan Chaucer, the first warbler, whose sweet breath\n     Preluded those melodious bursts that fill\n     The spacious times of great Elizabeth\n     With sounds that echo still.”\n\nChaucer exhibits, in a high degree, this life of the spirit,\nand it is the secret of the charm which his poetry possesses for us\nafter a lapse of five hundred years.  It vitalizes, warms, fuses,\nand imparts a lightsomeness to his verse; it creeps and kindles\nbeneath the tissues of his thought.  When we compare Dryden’s\nmodernizations of Chaucer with the originals, we see the difference\nbetween the verse of a poet, with a healthy vitality of spirit, and,\nthrough that healthy vitality of spirit, having secret dealings\nwith things, and verse which is largely the product of the rhetorical\nor literary faculty.  We do not feel, when reading the latter,\nthat any unconscious might co-operated with the conscious powers\nof the writer.  But we DO feel this when we read Chaucer’s verse.\n\nAll of the Canterbury Tales have originals or analogues,\nmost of which have been reproduced by the London Chaucer Society.\nNot one of the tales is of Chaucer’s own invention.  And yet they may\nall be said to be original, in the truest, deepest sense of the word.\nThey have been vitalized from the poet’s own soul.  He has infused\nhis own personality, his own spirit-life, into his originals;\nhe has “created a soul under the ribs of death.”  It is this\ninfused vitality which will constitute the charm of\nthe Canterbury Tales for all generations of English speaking\nand English reading people.  This life of the spirit,\nof which I am speaking, as distinguished from the intellect,\nis felt, though much less distinctly, in a contemporary work,\n‘The Vision of William concerning Piers the Plowman’.\nWhat the author calls “KIND WIT”, that is, “natural intelligence”,\nhas, generally, the ascendency.  We meet, however,\nwith powerful passages, wherein the thoughts are aglow\nwith the warmth from the writer’s inner spirit.  He shows at times\nthe moral indignation of a Hebrew prophet.\n\nThe ‘Confessio Amantis’ of John Gower, another contemporary work,\nexhibits comparatively little of the life of the spirit,\neither in its verse or in its thought.  The thought rarely passes\nthe limit of natural intelligence.  The stories, which the poet drew\nfrom the ‘Gesta Romanorum’ and numerous other sources, can hardly\nbe said to have been BORN AGAIN.  The verse is smooth and fluent,\nbut the reader feels it to be the product of literary skill.\nIt wants what can be imparted only by an unconscious might\nback of the consciously active and trained powers.  It is this\nunconscious might which John Keats, in his ‘Sleep and Poetry’,\nspeaks of as “might half slumbering on its own right arm”,\nand which every reader, with the requisite susceptibility,\ncan always detect in the verse of a true poet.\n\nIn the interval between Chaucer and Spenser, this life of the spirit\nis not distinctly marked in any of its authors, not excepting even\nHenry Howard, Earl of Surrey, whose sad fate gave a factitious interest\nto his writings.  It is more noticeable in Thomas Sackville,\nLord Buckhurst’s ‘Induction to the Mirror for Magistrates’, which,\nin the words of Hallam, “forms a link which unites the school\nof Chaucer and Lydgate to the ‘Faerie Queene’.”\n\nThe Rev. James Byrne, of Trinity College, Dublin, in his lecture on\n‘The Influence of National Character on English Literature’,\nremarks of Spenser:  “After that dark period which separated him\nfrom Chaucer, after all the desolation of the Wars of the Roses,\nand all the deep trials of the Reformation, he rose on England as if,\nto use an image of his own,\n\n     “‘At last the golden orientall gate\n     Of greatest heaven gan to open fayre,\n     And Phoebus, fresh as brydegrome to his mate,\n     Came dauncing forth, shaking his deawie hayre,\n     And hurled his glistering beams through gloomy ayre.’\n\n“That baptism of blood and fire through which England passed\nat the Reformation, raised both Protestant and Catholic to a newness\nof life.  That mighty working of heart and mind with which the nation\nthen heaved throughout, went through every man and woman,\nand tried what manner of spirits they were of.  What a preparation\nwas this for that period of our literature in which man,\nthe great actor of the drama of life, was about to appear on the stage!\nIt was to be expected that the drama should then start into life,\nand that human character should speak from the stage\nwith a depth of life never known before; but who could have\nimagined Shakespeare?”\n\nAnd what a new music burst upon the world in Spenser’s verse!\nHis noble stanza, so admirably adapted to pictorial effect,\nhas since been used by some of the greatest poets of the literature,\nThomson, Scott, Wordsworth, Byron, Keats, Shelley, and numerous others;\nbut none of them, except in rare instances, have drawn the music\nout of it which Spenser drew.\n\nProfessor Goldwin Smith well remarks, in his article\non Mark Pattison’s Milton, “The great growths of poetry have coincided\nwith the great bursts of national life, and the great bursts\nof national life have hitherto been generally periods\nof controversy and struggle.  Art itself, in its highest forms,\nhas been the expression of faith.  We have now people who profess\nto cultivate art for its own sake; but they have hardly produced\nanything which the world accepts as great, though they have supplied\nsome subjects for ‘Punch’.”\n\nSpenser who, of all the great English poets, is regarded\nby some critics as the most remote from real life,\nand the least reflecting his age, is, nevertheless, filled with\nthe spirit of his age--its chivalric, romantic, patriotic, moral,\nand religious spirit.  When he began to write, the nation had\njust passed through the fiery furnace of a religious persecution,\nand was rejoicing in its deliverance from the papistical rule of Mary.\nThe devotion to the new queen with which it was inspired was grateful,\ngenerous, enthusiastic, and even romantic.  This devotion\nSpenser’s great poem everywhere reflects, and it has been\njustly pronounced to be the best exponent of the subtleties\nof that Calvinism which was the aristocratic form of Protestantism\nat that time in both France and England.\n\nThe renewed spiritual life which set in so strongly with Spenser,\nreached its springtide in Shakespeare.  It was the secret\nof that sense of moral proportion which pervades his plays.\nMoral proportion cannot be secured through the laws of the ancients,\nor through any formulated theory of art.  It was, I am assured,\nthrough his deep and sensitive spirit-life that Shakespeare felt\nthe universal spirit and constitution of the world as fully, perhaps,\nas the human soul, in this life, is capable of feeling it.  Through it\nhe took cognizance of the workings of nature, and of the life of man,\nBY DIRECT ASSIMILATION OF THEIR HIDDEN PRINCIPLES,--\nprinciples which cannot be reached through an observation,\nby the natural intelligence, of the phenomenal.  He thus became\npossessed of a knowledge, or rather wisdom, far beyond\nhis conscious observation and objective experience.\n\nShakespeare may be regarded as the first and the last\ngreat artistic physiologist or natural historian of the passions;\nand he was this by virtue of the life of the spirit, which enabled him\nto reproduce sympathetically the whole range of human passion\nwithin himself.  He was the first of the world’s dramatists\nthat exhibited the passions in their evolutions, and in\ntheir subtlest complications.  And the moral proportion he preserved\nin exhibiting the complex and often wild play of the passions\nmust have been largely due to the harmony of his soul\nwith the constitution of things.  What the Restoration dramatists\nregarded or understood as moral proportion, was not moral proportion\nat all, but a proportion fashioned according to merely conventional\nideas of justice.  Shakespeare’s moral proportion appeared to them,\nin their low spiritual condition, a moral chaos, which they\nset about converting, in some of his great plays, into a cosmos;\nand a sad muss, if not a ridiculous muss, they made of it.\nSignal examples of this are the ‘rifacimenti’ of the Tempest by Dryden\nand Davenant, the King Lear by Tate, and the Antony and Cleopatra\n(entitled ‘All for Love, or the World well Lost’) by Dryden.\n\nIn Milton, though there is a noticeable, an even distinctly marked,\nreduction of the life of the spirit (in the sense in which I have been\nusing these words) exhibited by Shakespeare, it is still very strong\nand efficient, and continues uninfluenced by the malign atmosphere\naround him the last fifteen years of his life, which were lived\nin the reign of Charles II.  Within that period he wrote\nthe ‘Paradise Lost’, ‘Paradise Regained’, and ‘Samson Agonistes’.\n“Milton,” says Emerson, “was the stair or high table-land to let down\nthe English genius from the summits of Shakespeare.”\n\n“These heights could not be maintained.  They were followed by\na meanness and a descent of the mind into lower levels;\nthe loss of wings; no high speculation.  Locke, to whom the meaning\nof ideas was unknown, became the type of philosophy,\nand his “understanding” the measure, in all nations,\nof the English intellect.  His countrymen forsook the lofty sides\nof Parnassus, on which they had once walked with echoing steps,\nand disused the studies once so beloved; the powers of thought\nfell into neglect.”\n\nThe highest powers of thought cannot be realized without the life\nof the spirit.  It is this, as I have already said, which has been\nthe glory of the greatest thinkers since the world began;\nnot their intellects, but the co-operating, unconscious power\nIMMANENT in their intellects.\n\nDuring the Restoration period, and later, spiritual life\nwas at its very lowest ebb.  I mean, spiritual life\nas exhibited in the poetic and dramatic literature of the time,\nwhose poisoned fountain-head was the dissolute court of Charles II.\nAll the slops of that court went into the drama,\nall the ‘sentina reipublicae’, the bilge water of the ship of state.\nThe dramatic writers of the time, to use the words of St. Paul\nin his letter to the Ephesians, “walked in the vanity of their mind;\nhaving the understanding darkened, being alienated from\nthe life of God through the ignorance that was in them\nbecause of the blindness of their heart; who, being past feeling,\ngave themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness\nwith greediness.”  The age, as Emerson says, had no live, distinct,\nactuating convictions.  It was in even worse than a negative condition.\nAs represented by its drama and poetry, it may almost be said\nto have repudiated the moral sentiment.  A spiritual disease\naffected the upper classes, which continued down into the reign\nof the Georges.  There appears to have been but little belief\nin the impulse which the heart imparts to the intellect,\nor that the latter draws greatness from the inspiration of the former.\nThere was a time in the history of the Jews in which, it is recorded,\n“there was no open vision”.  It can be said, emphatically,\nthat in the time of Charles II. there was no open vision.\nAnd yet that besotted, that spiritually dark age, which was afflicted\nwith pneumatophobia, flattered itself that there had never been an age\nso flooded with light.  The great age of Elizabeth (which designation\nI would apply to the period of fifty years or more, from 1575 to 1625,\nor somewhat later), in which the human faculties, in their whole range,\nboth intellectual and spiritual, reached such a degree of expansion\nas they had never before reached in the history of the world,--\nthat great age, I say, the age of Spenser, Sidney, Marlowe,\nShakespeare, Bacon, Raleigh, Hooker, Ben Jonson, Beaumont, Fletcher,\nChapman, Dekker, Ford, Herbert, Heywood, Massinger (and this list\nof great names might be continued),--that great age, I say,\nwas regarded by the men of the Restoration period as barbarous\nin comparison with their own.  But beneath all, still lay\nthe restorative elements of the English character, which were to\nreassert themselves and usher in a new era of literary productiveness,\nthe greatest since the Elizabethan age, and embodying\nthe highest ideals of life to which the race has yet attained.\nWe can account, to some extent, for this interregnum or spiritual life,\nbut only to some extent.  The brutal heartlessness and licentiousness\nof the court which the exiled Charles brought back with him,\nand the release from Puritan restraint, explain partly\nthe state of things, or rather the degree to which the state of things\nwas pushed.\n\nIn the middle of the eighteenth century, or somewhat earlier,\nthe rise of the spiritual tide is distinctly observable.\nWe see a reaction setting in against the soulless poetry\nwhich culminated in Alexander Pope, whose ‘Rape of the Lock’\nis the masterpiece of that poetry.  It is, in fact, the most brilliant\nsociety-poem in the literature.  De Quincey pronounces it to be,\nthough somewhat extravagantly, “the most exquisite monument\nof playful fancy that universal literature offers.”  Bishop Warburton,\none of the great critical authorities of the age, believed in\nthe infallibility of Pope, if not of THE Pope.\n\nTo notice but a few of the influences at work:  Thomson sang\nof the Seasons, and invited attention to the beauties of\nthe natural world, to which the previous generation had been blind\nand indifferent.  Bishop Percy published his ‘Reliques of Ancient\nEnglish Poetry’, thus awakening a new interest in the old ballads\nwhich had sprung from the heart of the people, and contributing much\nto free poetry from the yoke of the conventional and the artificial,\nand to work a revival of natural unaffected feeling.  Thomas Tyrwhitt\nedited in a scholarly and appreciative manner, the Canterbury Tales\nof Chaucer.  James McPherson published what he claimed to be\ntranslations from the poems of Ossian, the son of Fingal.\nWhether genuine or not, these poems indicated the tendency of the time.\nIn Scotland, the old ballad spirit, which had continued to exist\nwith a vigor but little abated by the influence of the artificial,\nmechanical school of poetry, was gathered up and intensified\nin the songs of him “who walked in glory and in joy,\nfollowing his plow, along the mountain-side”, and who is entitled to\na high rank among the poetical reformers of the age.\n\nIt is not surprising that the great literary dictator in Percy’s day,\nDr. Samuel Johnson, should treat the old ballads with ridicule.\nThe good man had been trained in a different school of poetry,\nand could not in his old age yield to the reactionary movement.\nBishop Warburton, who ranked next to Johnson in literary authority,\nhad nothing but sneering contempt to bestow upon upon the old ballads,\nand this feeling was shared by many others in the foremost ranks\nof literature and criticism.  But in the face of all opposition,\nand aided by the yearning for literary liberty that was abroad,\nthe old ballads grew more and more into favor.  The influence of\nthis folklore was not confined to England.  It extended across the sea,\nand swayed the genius of such poets as Buerger and Goethe\nand Schiller.\n\nAlong with the poetical revival in the eighteenth century,\ncame the great religious revival inaugurated by the Wesleys\nand Whitefield; and of this revival, the poetry of William Cowper\nwas a direct product.  But the two revivals were co-radical,--\none was not derived from the other.  The long-suppressed\nspiritual elements of the nation began to reassert themselves\nin religion and in poetry.  The Church had been as sound asleep\nas the Muses.\n\nCowper belongs to the Whitefield side of the religious revival,\nthe Evangelicals, as they were called (those that remained within\nthe Establishment).  In his poem entitled ‘Hope’, he vindicates\nthe memory of Whitefield under the name Leuconomus, a translation\ninto Greek, of White field.  It was his conversion to Evangelicism\nwhich gave him his inspiration and his themes.  ‘The Task’ has been\nas justly called the poem of Methodism as the ‘Paradise Lost’\nhas been called the epic of Puritanism.  In it we are presented with\na number of pictures of the utterly fossilized condition of the clergy\nof the day in the Established Church (see especially book II.,\nvv. 326-832, in which he satirizes the clergy and the universities).\n\nCowper has been truly characterized by Professor Goldwin Smith,\nas “the apostle of feeling to a hard age, to an artificial age,\nthe apostle of nature.  He opened beneath the arid surface\nof a polished but soulless society, a fountain of sentiment\nwhich had long ceased to flow.”\n\nThe greatest things in this world are often done by those\nwho do not know they are doing them.  This is especially true\nof William Cowper.  He was wholly unaware of the great mission\nhe was fulfilling; his contemporaries were wholly unaware of it.\nAnd so temporal are the world’s standards, in the best of times,\nthat spiritual regenerators are not generally recognized until\nlong after they have passed away, when the results of what they did\nare fully ripe, and philosophers begin to trace the original impulses.\n\n     “Only reapers, reaping early\n     In among the bearded barley,\n     Hear a song that echoes cheerly\n     From the river winding clearly\n          Down to towered Camelot:\n\n     And by the moon the reaper weary,\n     Piling sheaves in uplands airy,\n     Listening, whispers, ‘Tis the fairy\n          Lady of Shalott.”\n\nJohn Burroughs, in his inspiring essay on Walt Whitman\nentitled ‘The Flight of the Eagle’, quotes the following sentence\nfrom a lecture on Burns, delivered by “a lecturer from over seas”,\nwhom he does not name:  “When literature becomes dozy, respectable,\nand goes in the smooth grooves of fashion, and copies and copies again,\nsomething must be done; and to give life to that dying literature,\na man must be found not educated under its influence.”\n\nSuch a man I would say was William Cowper, who, in his weakness, was\n\n     “Strong to sanctify the poet’s high vocation”,\n\nand who\n\n     “Testified this solemn truth, while phrenzy desolated,--\n     Nor man nor angel satisfies whom only God created.”\n\nJohn Keats, in his poem entitled ‘Sleep and Poetry’,\nhas well characterized the soulless poetry of the period between\nthe Restoration and the poetical revival in the latter part\nof the eighteenth century, but more especially of the Popian period.\nAfter speaking of the greatness of his favorite poets\nof the Elizabethan period, he continues:--\n\n          “Could all this be forgotten?  Yes, a schism\n     Nurtured by foppery and barbarism,\n     Made great Apollo blush for this his land.\n     Men were thought wise who could not understand\n     His glories:  with a puling infant’s force\n     They sway’d about upon a rocking-horse,\n     And thought it Pegasus.”\n\n(Alluding to the rocking-horse movement of the Popian verse.)\n\n                    “Ah dismal soul’d!\n     The winds of heaven blew, the ocean roll’d\n     It’s gathering waves--ye felt it not.  The blue\n     Bar’d its eternal bosom, and the dew\n     Of summer nights collected still to make\n     The morning precious:  beauty was awake!\n     Why were ye not awake?  But ye were dead\n     To things ye knew not of,--were closely wed\n     To musty laws lined out with wretched rule\n     And compass vile:  so that ye taught a school\n     Of dolts to smooth, inlay, and clip, and fit,\n     Till, like the certain wands of Jacob’s wit,\n     Their verses tallied.  Easy was the task:\n     A thousand handicraftsmen wore the mask\n     Of Poesy.  Ill-fated, impious race!\n     That blasphem’d the bright Lyrist to his face,\n     And did not know it,--no, they went about,\n     Holding a poor, decrepid standard out\n     Mark’d with most flimsy mottoes, and in large\n     The name of one Boileau!”\n\nIt was these lines that raised the ire of Byron, who regarded them\nas an irreverent assault upon his favorite poet, Pope.\nIn the controversy occasioned by the Rev. W. L. Bowles’s strictures\non the Life and Writings of Pope, Byron perversely asks,\n“Where is the poetry of which one-half is good?  Is it the Aeneid?\nIs it Milton’s?  Is it Dryden’s?  Is it any one’s except Pope’s\nand Goldsmith’s, of which ALL is good?”\n\nIn the first quarter of the nineteenth century, the spiritual flow\nwhich, as I have said, set in about the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, and received its first great impulse\nfrom William Cowper, reached its high tide in Wordsworth, Coleridge,\nShelley, Keats, Southey, and Byron.  These poets were all,\nmore or less, influenced by that great moral convulsion,\nthe French revolution, which stirred men’s souls to their\ndeepest depths, induced a vast stimulation of the meditative faculties,\nand contributed much toward the unfolding of the ideas\n“on man, on nature, and on human life”, which have since\nso vitalized English poetry. *\n\n    --\n     * “The agitation, the frenzy, the sorrow of the times,\n     reacted upon the human intellect, and FORCED men into meditation.\n     Their own nature was held up before them in a sterner form.\n     They were compelled to contemplate an ideal of man, far more colossal\n     than is brought forward in the tranquil aspects of society;\n     and they were often engaged, whether they would or not,\n     with the elementary problems of social philosophy.  Mere danger\n     forced a man into thoughts which else were foreign to his habits.\n     Mere necessity of action forced him to decide.”\n    --Thomas De Quincey’s ‘Essay on Style’.\n    --\n\nWordsworth exhibited in his poetry, as they had never before\nbeen exhibited, the permanent absolute relations of nature\nto the human spirit, interpreted the relations between\nthe elemental powers of creation and the moral life of man,\nand vindicated the inalienable birthright of the lowliest of men\nto those inward “oracles of vital deity attesting the Hereafter.”\n Wordsworth’s poetry is, in fact, so far as it bears upon\nthe natural world, a protest against the association theory of beauty\nof the eighteenth century--a theory which was an offshoot of\nthe philosophy of Locke, well characterized by Macvicar,\nin his ‘Philosophy of the Beautiful’ (Introd., pp. xv., xvi),\nas “an ingenious hypothesis for the close of the eighteenth century,\nwhen the philosophy then popular did not admit, as the ground\nof any knowledge, anything higher than self-repetition\nand the transformation of sensations.”\n\nColeridge’s ‘Rime of the Ancient Mariner’ is an imaginative expression\nof that divine love which embraces all creatures, from the highest\nto the lowest, of the consequences of the severance of man’s soul\nfrom this animating principle of the universe, and of those\nspiritual threshings by and through which it is brought again\nunder its blessed influence.  In his ‘Cristabel’ he has exhibited\nthe dark principle of evil, lurking within the good,\nand ever struggling with it.  We read it in the spell the wicked witch\nGeraldine works upon her innocent and unsuspecting protector;\nwe read it in the strange words which Geraldine addresses\nto the spirit of the saintly mother who has approached to shield\nfrom harm the beloved child for whom she died; we read it in the story\nof the friendship and enmity between the Baron and Sir Roland de Vaux\nof Tryermaine; we read it in the vision seen in the forest\nby the minstrel Bard, of the bright green snake coiled around\nthe wings and neck of a fluttering dove; and, finally, we read it\nin its most startling form, in the conclusion of the poem,\n“A little child, a limber elf, singing, dancing to itself,” etc.,\nwherein is exhibited the strange tendency to express love’s excess\n“with words of unmeant bitterness”.  This dark principle of evil,\nwe may suppose, after dwelling in the poet’s mind, in an abstract form,\ncrept into this broken poem, where it lies coiled up among\nthe choicest and most fragrant flowers, and occasionally springs\nits warning rattle, and projects its forked tongue, to assure us of\nits ugly presence.\n\nBoth these great poems show the influence of the revival of\nthe old English Ballads.  Coleridge had drunk deep of their spirit.\n\nShelley and Byron were fully charged with the revolutionary spirit\nof the time.  Shelley, of all the poets of his generation,\nhad the most prophetic fervor in regard to the progress of\nthe democratic spirit.  All his greatest poems are informed\nwith this fervor, but it is especially exhibited in\nthe ‘Prometheus Unbound’, which is, in the words of Todhunter,\n“to all other lyrical poems what the ninth symphony is to all\nother symphonies; and more than this, for Shelley has here\noutsoared himself more unquestionably than Beethoven in his last\ngreat orchestral work. . . .  The Titan Prometheus is the incarnation\nof the genius of humanity, chained and suffering under the tyranny\nof the evil principle which at present rules over the world,\ntypified in Jupiter; the name Prometheus, FORESIGHT, connecting him\nwith that poetic imagination which is the true prophetic power,\npenetrating the mystery of things, because, as Shelley implies,\nit is a kind of divine Logos incarnate in man--a creative force\nwhich dominates nature by acting in harmony with her.”\n\nIt is, perhaps, more correct to say of Byron, that he was charged\nwith the spirit of revolt rather than with the revolutionary spirit.\nThe revolutionary spirit was in him indefinite, inarticulate;\nhe offered nothing to put in the place of the social and political\nevils against which he rebelled.  There is nothing CONSTRUCTIVE\nin his poetry.  But if his great passion-capital, his keen\nspiritual susceptibility, and his great power of vigorous expression,\nhad been brought into the service of constructive thought,\nhe might have been a restorative power in his generation.\n\nThe greatest loss which English poetry ever sustained,\nwas in the premature death of John Keats.  What he would have done\nhad his life been spared, we have an assurance in what he has left us.\nHe was spiritually constituted to be one of the subtlest interpreters\nof the secrets of life that the whole range of English poetry exhibits.\nNo poet ever more deeply felt “the vital connection of beauty\nwith truth”.  He realized in himself his idea of the poet\nexpressed in his lines,--\n\n     “‘Tis the man who with a man\n     Is an equal, be he king,\n     Or poorest of the beggar-clan,\n     Or any other wondrous thing\n     A man may be ‘twixt ape and Plato;\n     ‘Tis the man who with a bird,\n     Wren, or eagle, finds his way to\n     All its instincts; he hath heard\n     The lion’s roaring, and can tell\n     What his horny throat expresseth,\n     And to him the tiger’s yell\n     Comes articulate and presseth\n     On his ear like mother tongue.” *\n\n--\n* “We often think of Shelley and Keats together,\nand they seem to have an attraction for minds of the same cast.\nThey were both exposed to the same influences, those revolutionary\ninfluences in literature and religion which inaugurated a new period.\nYet there is a great contrast as well as a great similarity\nbetween them, and it is interesting to remark the different\nspiritual results in the case of these two different minds\nsubjected to conditions so similar in general, though different\nin detail.  Both felt the same need, the need of ESCAPE,\ndesiring to escape from the actual world in which they perceived\nmore evil than good, to some other ideal world which they had\nto create for themselves.  This is the point of their similarity;\ntheir need and motive were the same, to escape from the limitations\nof the present.  But they escaped in different directions,\nKeats into the past where he reconstructed a mythical Greek world\nafter the designs of his own fancy, Shelley into a future where\nhe sought in a new and distant era, in a new and distant world,\na refuge from the present.  We may compare Keats’s ‘Hyperion’\nwith Shelley’s ‘Prometheus’, as both poems touch the same idea--\nthe dominion of elder gods usurped by younger, for Prometheus belonged\nto the elder generation.  The impression Keats gives us is that\nhe represents the dethroned gods in the sad vale, “far from\nthe fiery noon”, for the pleasure of moving among them himself,\nand creates their lonely world as a retreat for his own spirit.\nWhereas in the ‘Prometheus Unbound’ we feel that the scenes\nlaid in ancient days and built on Greek myths, have a direct relation\nto the destinies of man, and that Shelley went back into the past\nbecause he believed it was connected with the future,\nand because he could use it as an artistic setting for exhibiting\nan ideal world in the future.\n\n“This problem of escape--to rescue the soul from the clutches\nof time, ‘ineluctabile tempus’,--which Keats and Shelley\ntried to resolve for themselves by creating a new world in the past\nand the future, met Browning too.  The new way which Browning\nhas essayed--the way in which he accepts the present and deals\nwith it, CLOSES with time instead of trying to elude it,\nand discovers in the struggle that this time, ‘ineluctabile tempus’,\nis really a faithful vassal of eternity, and that its limits serve\nand do not enslave illimitable spirit.”\n\n--From a Paper\nby John B. Bury, B.A., Trin. Coll., Dublin, on Browning’s\n‘Aristophanes’ Apology’, read at 38th meeting of the Browning Soc.,\nJan. 29, 1886.\n--\n\nWordsworth, and the other poets I have named, Byron, Shelley, Keats,\nand Coleridge, made such a protest against authority in poetry\nas had been made in the 16th century against authority in religion;\nand for this authority were substituted the soul-experiences\nof the individual poet, who set his verse to the song that was\nwithin him, and chose such subjects as would best embody and articulate\nthat song.\n\nBut by the end of the first quarter of the present century,\nthe great poetical billow, which was not indeed caused by,\nbut received an impulse from, the great political billow,\nthe French Revolution (for they were cognate or co-radical movements),\nhad quite spent itself, and English poetry was at a comparatively\nlow ebb.  The Poetical Revolution had done its work.\nA poetical interregnum of a few years’ duration followed,\nin which there appeared to be a great reduction of the spiritual life\nof which poetry is the outgrowth.\n\nMr. Edmund W. Gosse, in his article ‘On the Early Writings\nof Robert Browning’, in the ‘Century’ for December, 1881,\nhas characterized this interregnum a little too contemptuously,\nperhaps.  There was, indeed, a great fall in the spiritual tide;\nbut it was not such a dead-low tide as Mr. Gosse would make it.\n\nAt length, in 1830, appeared a volume of poems by a young man,\nthen but twenty-one years of age, which distinctly marked\nthe setting in of a new order of things.  It bore the following title:\n‘Poems, chiefly Lyrical.  By Alfred Tennyson, London:\nEffingham Wilson, Royal Exchange, Cornhill, 1830.’  pp. 154.\n\nThe volume comprised fifty-three poems, among which were ‘The Poet’\nand ‘The Poet’s Mind’.  These two poems were emphatically indicative\nof the high ideal of poetry which had been attained,\nand to the development of which the band of poets of\nthe preceding generation had largely contributed.\n\nA review of the volume, by John Stuart Mill, then a young man\nnot yet twenty-five years of age, was published in ‘The Westminster’\nfor January, 1831.  It bears testimony to the writer’s fine insight\nand sure foresight; and it bears testimony, too, to his high estimate\nof the function of poetry in this world--an estimate, too,\nin kind and in degree, not older than this present century.\nThe review is as important a landmark in the development\nof poetical criticism, as are the two poems I have mentioned,\nin the development of poetical ideals, in the nineteenth century.\n\nIn the concluding paragraph of the review, Mill says: “A genuine poet\nhas deep responsibilities to his country and the world, to the present\nand future generations, to earth and heaven.  He, of all men,\nshould have distinct and worthy objects before him,\nand consecrate himself to their promotion.  It is thus that he\nbest consults the glory of his art, and his own lasting fame. . . .\nMr. Tennyson knows that “the poet’s mind is holy ground”;\nhe knows that the poet’s portion is to be\n\n     “Dower’d with the hate of hate, the scorn of scorn,\n          The love of love”;\n\nhe has shown, in the lines from which we quote, his own\njust conception of the grandeur of a poet’s destiny;\nand we look to him for its fulfilment. . . .  If our estimate\nof Mr. Tennyson be correct, he too is a poet; and many years hence\nmay be read his juvenile description of that character with\nthe proud consciousness that it has become the description and history\nof his own works.”\n\nTwo years later, that is, in 1832 (the volume, however,\nis antedated 1833), appeared ‘Poems by Alfred Tennyson’, pp. 163.\nIn it were contained ‘The Lady of Shalott’, and the untitled poems,\nknown by their first lines, ‘You ask me why, tho’ ill at ease’,\n‘Of old sat Freedom on the Heights’, and ‘Love thou thy Land,\nwith Love far brought’.\n\nIn ‘The Lady of Shalott’ is mystically shadowed forth the relation\nwhich poetic genius should sustain to the world for whose\nspiritual redemption it labors, and the fatal consequences\nof its being seduced by the world’s temptations, the lust of the flesh,\nand the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.\n\nThe other poems, ‘You ask me why’, ‘Of old sat Freedom’,\nand ‘Love thou thy land’, are important as exponents of what\nmay be called the poet’s institutional creed.  A careful study\nof his subsequent poetry will show that in these early poems\nhe accurately and distinctly revealed the attitude toward\noutside things which he has since maintained.  He is a good deal\nof an institutional poet, and, as compared with Browning,\na STRONGLY institutional poet.  Browning’s supreme and\nall-absorbing interest is in individual souls.  He cares but little,\nevidently, about institutions.  At any rate, he gives them little\nor no place in his poetry.  Tennyson is a very decided\nreactionary product of the revolutionary spirit which inspired\nsome of his poetical predecessors of the previous generation.\nHe has a horror of the revolutionary.  To him, the French Revolution\nwas “the blind hysterics of the Celt”, {‘In Memoriam’, cix.},\nand “the red fool-fury of the Seine” {‘I. M.’, cxxvii.}.\nHe attaches great importance to the outside arrangements of society\nfor upholding and advancing the individual.  He would “make Knowledge\ncircle with the winds”, but “her herald, Reverence”, must\n\n                    “fly\n     Before her to whatever sky\n     Bear seed of men and growth of minds.”\n\nHe has a great regard for precedents, almost AS precedents.\nHe is emphatically the poet of law and order.  All his sympathies\nare decidedly, but not narrowly, conservative.  He is, in short,\na choice product of nineteenth century ENGLISH civilization;\nand his poetry may be said to be the most distinct expression\nof the refinements of English culture--refinements, rather than\nthe ruder but more vital forms of English strength and power.\nAll his ideals of institutions and the general machinery of life,\nare derived from England.  She is\n\n          “the land that freemen till,\n     That sober-suited Freedom chose,\n     The land where, girt with friends or foes,\n     A man may speak the thing he will;\n\n     A land of SETTLED GOVERNMENT,\n     A LAND OF JUST AND OLD RENOWN,\n     WHERE FREEDOM BROADENS SLOWLY DOWN\n     FROM PRECEDENT TO PRECEDENT:\n\n     Where faction seldom gathers head,\n     But by degrees to fullness wrought,\n     The strength of some diffusive thought\n     Hath time and space to work and spread.”\n\nBut the anti-revolutionary and the institutional features\nof Tennyson’s poetry are not those of the higher ground of his poetry.\nThey are features which, though primarily due, it may be,\nto the poet’s temperament, are indirectly due to the particular form\nof civilization in which he has lived, and moved, and had his culture,\nand which he reflects more than any of his poetical contemporaries.\n\nThe most emphasized and most vitalized idea, the idea which\nglints forth everywhere in his poetry, which has the most important\nbearing on man’s higher life, and which marks the height\nof the spiritual tide reached in his poetry, is, that the highest\norder of manhood is a well-poised, harmoniously operating duality\nof the active or intellectual or discursive, and the passive\nor spiritually sensitive.  This is the idea which INFORMS his poem\nof ‘The Princess’.  It is prominent in ‘In Memoriam’ and in\n‘The Idylls of the King’.  In ‘The Princess’, the Prince,\nspeaking of the relations of the sexes, says:--\n\n          “in the long years liker must they grow;\n     The man be more of woman, she of man;\n     He gain in sweetness and in moral height,\n     Nor lose the wrestling thews that throw the world;\n     She mental breadth, nor fail in childward care,\n     Nor lose the childlike in the larger mind;\n     Till at the last she set herself to man,\n     Like perfect music unto noble words;\n     And so these twain, upon the skirts of Time,\n     Sit side by side, full-summ’d in all their powers,\n     Dispensing harvest, sowing the To-be,\n     Self-reverent each and reverencing each,\n     Distinct in individualities,\n     But like each other ev’n as those who love.\n     Then comes the statelier Eden back to men:\n     Then reign the world’s great bridals, chaste and calm:\n     Then springs the crowning race of humankind.”\n\nTo state briefly the cardinal Tennysonian idea, man must realize\na WOMANLY MANLINESS, and woman a MANLY WOMANLINESS.\n\nTennyson presents to us his ideal man in the 109th section\nof ‘In Memoriam’.  It is descriptive of his friend,\nArthur Henry Hallam.  All that is most characteristic of Tennyson,\neven his Englishness, is gathered up in this poem of six stanzas.\nIt is interesting to meet with such a representative and comprehensive\nbit in a great poet.\n\n     “HEART-AFFLUENCE in discursive talk\n     From household fountains never dry;\n     The CRITIC CLEARNESS of an eye,\n     That saw through all the Muses’ walk;\n\n     SERAPHIC INTELLECT AND FORCE\n     TO SEIZE AND THROW THE DOUBTS OF MAN;\n     IMPASSIONED LOGIC, which outran\n     The bearer in its fiery course;\n\n     HIGH NATURE AMOROUS OF THE GOOD,\n     BUT TOUCH’D WITH NO ASCETIC GLOOM;\n     And passions pure in snowy bloom\n     Through all the years of April blood.”\n\nThe first two verses of this stanza also characterize the King Arthur\nof the ‘Idylls of the King’. *1*  In the next stanza we have\nthe poet’s institutional Englishness:--\n\n     “A love of freedom rarely felt,\n     Of freedom in her regal seat\n     Of England; not the school-boy heat,\n     The blind hysterics of the Celt;\n\n     And MANHOOD FUSED WITH FEMALE GRACE *2*\n     In such a sort, the child would twine\n     A trustful hand, unask’d, in thine,\n     And find his comfort in thy face;\n\n     All these have been, and thee mine eyes\n     Have look’d on; if they look’d in vain,\n     My shame is greater who remain,\n     Nor let thy wisdom make me wise.”\n\n--\n*1* See ‘The Holy Grail’, the concluding thirty-two verses, beginning:\n“And spake I not too truly, O my Knights”, and ending “ye have seen\nthat ye have seen”.\n\n*2* The idea of ‘The Princess’.\n--\n\nTennyson’s genius was early trained by the skeptical philosophy\nof the age.  All his poetry shows this.  The ‘In Memoriam’ may almost\nbe said to be the poem of nineteenth century scepticism.\nTo this scepticism he has applied an “all-subtilizing intellect”,\nand has translated it into the poetical “concrete”, with a rare\nartistic skill, and more than this, has subjected it to\nthe spiritual instincts and apperceptions of the feminine side\nof his nature and made it vassal to a larger faith.  But it is,\nafter all, not the vital faith which Browning’s poetry exhibits,\na faith PROCEEDING DIRECTLY FROM THE SPIRITUAL MAN.  It is rather\nthe faith expressed by Browning’s Bishop Blougram:--\n\n     “With me faith means perpetual unbelief\n     Kept quiet like the snake ‘neath Michael’s foot,\n     Who stands firm just because he feels it writhe.”\n\nAnd Tennyson, in picturing to us in the Idylls, the passage of the soul\n“from the great deep to the great deep”, appears to have felt\nit necessary to the completion of that picture (or why did he do it?),\nthat he should bring out that doubt at the last moment.\nThe dying Arthur is made to say:--\n\n               “I am going a long way\n     With these thou seest--if indeed I go\n     (For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)--\n     To the island-valley of Avilion”; etc.\n\nTennyson’s poetry is, in fact, an expression of the highest\nsublimation of the scepticism which came out of the eighteenth century,\nwhich invoked the authority of the sensualistic philosophy of Locke,\nand has since been fostered by the science of the nineteenth;\nwhile Browning’s poetry is a decided protest against,\nand a reactionary product of, that scepticism, that infidel philosophy\n(infidel as to the transcendental), and has CLOSED with it\nand borne away the palm.\n\nThe key-note of his poetry is struck in ‘Paracelsus’,\npublished in 1835, in his twenty-third year, and, with the exception\nof ‘Pauline’ published in 1833, the earliest of his compositions:\nParacelsus says (and he who knows Browning knows it to be\nsubstantially his own creed):--\n\n  “Truth is within ourselves; it takes no rise\n  From outward things, whate’er you may believe:\n  There is an inmost centre in us all,\n  Where truth abides in fulness; and around\n  Wall upon wall, the gross flesh hems it in,\n  This perfect, clear perception--which is truth;\n  A baffling and perverting carnal mesh\n  Blinds it, and makes all error: and ‘TO KNOW’\n  Rather consists in opening out a way\n  Whence the imprisoned splendour may escape,\n  Than in effecting entry for a light\n  Supposed to be without.  Watch narrowly\n  The demonstration of a truth, its birth,\n  And you trace back the effluence to its spring\n  And source within us, where broods radiance vast,\n  To be elicited ray by ray, as chance\n  Shall favour:  chance--for hitherto, your sage\n  Even as he knows not how those beams are born,\n  As little knows he what unlocks their fount;\n  And men have oft grown old among their books\n  To die, case-hardened in their ignorance,\n  Whose careless youth had promised what long years\n  Of unremitted labour ne’er performed:\n  While, contrary, it has chanced some idle day,\n  That autumn-loiterers just as fancy-free\n  As the midges in the sun, have oft given vent\n  To truth--produced mysteriously as cape\n  Of cloud grown out of the invisible air.\n  Hence, may not truth be lodged alike in all,\n  The lowest as the highest? some slight film\n  The interposing bar which binds it up,\n  And makes the idiot, just as makes the sage\n  Some film removed, the happy outlet whence\n  Truth issues proudly?  See this soul of ours!\n  How it strives weakly in the child, is loosed\n  In manhood, clogged by sickness, back compelled\n  By age and waste, set free at last by death:\n  Why is it, flesh enthralls it or enthrones?\n  What is this flesh we have to penetrate?\n  Oh, not alone when life flows still do truth\n  And power emerge, but also when strange chance\n  Ruffles its current; in unused conjuncture,\n  When sickness breaks the body--hunger, watching,\n  Excess, or languor--oftenest death’s approach--\n  Peril, deep joy, or woe.  One man shall crawl\n  Through life, surrounded with all stirring things,\n  Unmoved--and he goes mad; and from the wreck\n  Of what he was, by his wild talk alone,\n  You first collect how great a spirit he hid.\n  Therefore set free the spirit alike in all,\n  Discovering the true laws by which the flesh\n  Bars in the spirit! . . .\n       *    *    *    *    *\n                    I go to gather this\n  The sacred knowledge, here and there dispersed\n  About the world, long lost or never found.\n  And why should I be sad, or lorn of hope?\n  Why ever make man’s good distinct from God’s?\n  Or, finding they are one, why dare mistrust?\n  Who shall succeed if not one pledged like me?\n  Mine is no mad attempt to build a world\n  Apart from His, like those who set themselves\n  To find the nature of the spirit they bore,\n  And, taught betimes that all their gorgeous dreams\n  Were only born to vanish in this life,\n  Refused to fit them to this narrow sphere,\n  But chose to figure forth another world\n  And other frames meet for their vast desires,--\n  Still, all a dream!  Thus was life scorned; but life\n  Shall yet be crowned:  twine amaranth!  I am priest!”\n\n\nAnd again:--\n\n\n                    “In man’s self arise\n  August anticipations, symbols, types\n  Of a dim splendour ever on before,\n  In that eternal circle run by life:\n  For men begin to pass their nature’s bound,\n  And find new hopes and cares which fast supplant\n  Their proper joys and griefs; and outgrow all *\n  The narrow creeds of right and wrong, which fade\n  Before the unmeasured thirst for good; while peace\n  Rises within them ever more and more.\n  Such men are even now upon the earth,\n  Serene amid the half-formed creatures round,\n  Who should be saved by them and joined with them.”\n\n\nIn the last three verses is indicated the doctrine of\nthe regenerating power of exalted personalities, so prominent\nin Browning’s poetry, and which is treated in the next paper.\n\n--\n* proper:  In the sense of the Latin PROPRIUS, peculiar, private, personal.\n--\n\nThere is no ‘tabula rasa’ doctrine in these passages,\nnor in any others, in the poet’s voluminous works; and of all men\nof great intellect and learning (it is always a matter of mere\ninsulated intellect), born in England since the days of John Locke,\nno one, perhaps, has been so entirely untainted with this doctrine\nas Robert Browning.  It is a doctrine which great spiritual vitality\n(and that he early possessed), reaching out, as it does,\nbeyond all experience, beyond all transformation of sensations,\nand all conclusions of the discursive understanding,\nnaturally and spontaneously rejects.  It simply says, “I know better”,\nand there an end.\n\nThe great function of the poet, as poet, is, with Browning,\nto open out a way whence the imprisoned splendor may escape,\nnot to effect entry for a light supposed to be without;\nto trace back the effluence to its spring and source within us,\nwhere broods radiance vast, to be elicited ray by ray.\n\nIn ‘Fifine at the Fair’, published thirty-seven years\nafter ‘Paracelsus’, is substantially the same doctrine:--\n\n     “Truth inside, and outside, truth also; and between\n     Each, falsehood that is change, as truth is permanence.\n     The individual soul works through the shows of sense,\n     (Which, ever proving false, still promise to be true)\n     Up to an outer soul as individual too;\n     And, through the fleeting, lives to die into the fixed,\n     And reach at length ‘God, man, or both together mixed’.”\n\nIn his poem entitled ‘Popularity’, included in his “fifty men\nand women”, the speaker, in the monologue, “draws” his “true poet”,\nwhom HE knows, if others do not; who, though he renders,\nor stands ready to render, to his fellows, the supreme service\nof opening out a way whence the imprisoned splendor of their souls\nmay escape, is yet locked safe from end to end of this dark world.\n\nThough there may be, in his own time, no “reapers reaping early\nin among the bearded barley” and “piling sheaves in uplands airy”\n who hear his song, he holds the FUTURE fast, accepts\nthe COMING AGES’ duty, their present for this past.  This true,\ncreative poet, whom the speaker calls “God’s glow-worm,\ncreative in the sense of revealing, whose inmost centre,\nwhere truth abides in fulness, has that freedom of responsiveness\nto the divine which makes him the revealer of it to men,\nplays the part in the world of spirit which, in the material world\nwas played by the fisher who, first on the coast of Tyre the old,\nfished up the purple-yielding murex.  Until the precious liquor,\nfiltered by degrees, and refined to proof, is flasked and priced,\nand salable at last, the world stands aloof.  But when it is all ready\nfor the market, the small dealers, “put blue into their line”,\nand outdare each other in azure feats by which they secure\ngreat popularity, and, as a result, fare sumptuously;\nwhile he who fished the murex up was unrecognized, and fed, perhaps,\non porridge.\n\n\n\n\nPopularity.\n\n\n     I.\n\n     Stand still, true poet that you are!\n     I know you; let me try and draw you.\n     Some night you’ll fail us:  when afar\n     You rise, remember one man saw you,\n     Knew you, and named a star! *1*\n\n     II.\n\n     My star, God’s glow-worm!  Why extend\n     That loving hand of His which leads you,\n     Yet locks you safe from end to end\n     Of this dark world, unless He needs you,\n     Just saves your light to spend?\n\n     III.\n\n     His clenched hand shall unclose at last,\n     I know, and let out all the beauty:\n     My poet holds the future fast,\n     Accepts the coming ages’ duty,\n     Their present for this past.\n\n     IV.\n\n     That day, the earth’s feast-master’s brow\n     Shall clear, to God the chalice raising;\n     “Others give best at first, but Thou\n     Forever set’st our table praising,\n     Keep’st the good wine till now!”\n\n     V.\n\n     Meantime, I’ll draw you as you stand,\n     With few or none to watch and wonder:\n     I’ll say--a fisher, on the sand\n     By Tyre the old, with ocean-plunder,\n     A netful, brought to land.\n\n     VI.\n\n     Who has not heard how Tyrian shells\n     Enclosed the blue, that dye of dyes\n     Whereof one drop worked miracles,\n     And colored like Astarte’s eyes\n     Raw silk the merchant sells?\n\n     VII.\n\n     And each by-stander of them all\n     Could criticise, and quote tradition\n     How depths of blue sublimed some pall--\n     To get which, pricked a king’s ambition;\n     Worth sceptre, crown, and ball.\n\n     VIII.\n\n     Yet there’s the dye, in that rough mesh,\n     The sea has only just o’er-whispered!\n     Live whelks, each lip’s beard dripping fresh,\n     As if they still the water’s lisp heard\n     Through foam the rock-weeds thresh.\n\n     IX.\n\n     Enough to furnish Solomon\n     Such hangings for his cedar-house,\n     That, when gold-robed he took the throne\n     In that abyss of blue, the Spouse\n     Might swear his presence shone\n\n     X.\n\n     Most like the centre-spike of gold\n     Which burns deep in the blue-bell’s womb\n     What time, with ardors manifold,\n     The bee goes singing to her groom,\n     Drunken and overbold.\n\n     XI.\n\n     Mere conchs! not fit for warp or woof!\n     Till cunning come to pound and squeeze\n     And clarify,--refine to proof *2*\n     The liquor filtered by degrees,\n     While the world stands aloof.\n\n     XII.\n\n     And there’s the extract, flasked and fine,\n     And priced and salable at last!\n     And Hobbs, Nobbs, Stokes, and Nokes combine\n     To paint the future from the past,\n     Put blue into their line. *3*\n\n     XIII.\n\n     Hobbs hints blue,--straight he turtle eats:\n     Nobbs prints blue,--claret crowns his cup:\n     Nokes outdares Stokes in azure feats,--\n     Both gorge.  Who finished the murex up?\n     What porridge had John Keats?\n\n    --\n     *1* named:  Announced.\n     *2*  Original reading:--\n       “Till art comes,--comes to pound and squeeze\n       And clarify,--refines to proof.”\n      *3* “Line” is perhaps meant to be used equivocally,--\n     their line of business or line of their verse.\n    --\n\n\nThe spiritual ebb and flow exhibited in English poetry\n(the highest tide being reached in Tennyson and Browning)\nwhich I have endeavored cursorily to present, bear testimony\nto the fact that human nature WILL assert its wholeness\nin the civilized man.  And there must come a time, in the progress\nof civilization, when this ebb and flow will be less marked\nthan it has been heretofore, by reason of a better balancing,\nwhich will be brought about, of the intellectual and the spiritual.\nEach will have its due activity.  The man of intellectual pursuits\nwill not have a starved spiritual nature; and the man of predominant\nspiritual functions will not have an intellect weakened\ninto a submissiveness to formulated, stereotyped, and, consequently,\nlifeless dogmas.\n\nRobert Browning is in himself the completest fulfilment\nof this equipoise of the intellectual and the spiritual,\npossessing each in an exalted degree; and his poetry is\nan emphasized expression of his own personality, and a prophecy\nof the ultimate results of Christian civilization.\n\n\n\n\nII.  The Idea of Personality and of Art as an intermediate agency of Personality, as embodied in Browning’s Poetry.\n\n\n\n\n1.  General Remarks.\n\n     “Subsists no law of Life outside of Life.\n          *    *    *    *    *\n     The Christ himself had been no Lawgiver,\n     Unless he had given the LIFE, too, with the law.”\n\n\nThe importance of Robert Browning’s poetry, as embodying\nthe profoundest thought, the subtlest and most complex sentiment, and,\nabove all, the most quickening spirituality of the age, has, as yet,\nnotwithstanding the great increase within the last few years\nof devoted students, received but a niggardly recognition when compared\nwith that received by far inferior contemporary poets.  There are,\nhowever, many indications in the poetical criticism of the day\nthat upon it will ere long be pronounced the verdict which is its due.\nAnd the founding of a society in England in 1881, “to gather together\nsome at least of the many admirers of Robert Browning, for the study\nand discussion of his works, and the publication of papers on them,\nand extracts from works illustrating them” has already contributed\nmuch towards paying a long-standing debt.\n\nMr. Browning’s earliest poems, ‘Pauline’ (he calls it in the preface\nto the reprint of it in 1868 “a boyish work”, though it exhibits\nthe great basal thought of all his subsequent poetry),\nwas published in 1833, since which time he has produced\nthe largest body of poetry produced by any one poet\nin English literature; and the range of thought and passion\nwhich it exhibits is greater than that of any other poet,\nwithout a single exception, since the days of Shakespeare.\nAnd he is the most like Shakespeare in his deep interest\nin human nature in all its varieties of good and evil.\nThough endowed with a powerful, subtle, and restless intellect,\nhe has throughout his voluminous poetry made the strongest protest\nthat has been made in these days against mere intellect.\nAnd his poetry has, therefore, a peculiar value in an age\nlike the present--an age exhibiting “a condition of humanity\nwhich has thrown itself wholly on its intellect and its genius\nin physics, and has done marvels in material science and invention,\nbut at the expense of the interior divinity.”  It is the human heart,\nthat is, the intuitive, the non-discursive side of man, with its hopes\nand its prophetic aspirations, as opposed to the analytic,\nthe discursive understanding, which is to him a subject\nof the deepest and most scrutinizing interest.  He knows that\nits deepest depths are “deeper than did ever plummet sound”;\nbut he also knows that it is in these depths that life’s\ngreatest secrets must be sought.  The philosophies excogitated\nby the insulated intellect help nothing toward even a glimpse\nof these secrets.  In one of his later poems, that entitled ‘House’,\nhe has intimated, and forcibly intimated, his sense of\nthe impossibility of penetrating to the Holy of Holies of this\nwondrous human heart, though assured as he is that all our hopes\nin regard to the soul’s destiny are warmed and cherished\nby what radiates thence.  He quotes, in the last stanza of this poem,\nfrom Wordsworth’s sonnet on the Sonnet, “With this same key\nShakespeare unlocked his heart,” and then adds, “DID Shakespeare?\nIf so, the less Shakespeare he!”\n\nMrs. Browning, in the Fifth Book of her ‘Aurora Leigh’,\nhas given a full and very forcible expression to the feeling\nwhich has caused the highest dramatic genius of the present day\nto seek refuge in the poem and the novel.  “I will write no plays;\nbecause the drama, less sublime in this, makes lower appeals,\ndefends more menially, adopts the standard of the public taste\nto chalk its height on, wears a dog-chain round its regal neck,\nand learns to carry and fetch the fashions of the day,\nto please the day; . . .  ‘Tis that, honoring to its worth the drama,\nI would fear to keep it down to the level of the footlights. . . .\nThe growing drama has outgrown such toys of simulated stature, face,\nand speech, it also, peradventure, may outgrow the simulation\nof the painted scene, boards, actors, prompters, gaslight, and costume;\nand TAKE FOR A WORTHIER STAGE, THE SOUL ITSELF, ITS SHIFTING FANCIES\nAND CELESTIAL LIGHTS, WITH ALL ITS GRAND ORCHESTRAL SILENCES\nTO KEEP THE PAUSES OF THE RHYTHMIC SOUNDS.”\n\nRobert Browning’s poetry is, in these days, the fullest realization\nof what is expressed in the concluding lines of this passage:\nhe has taken for a worthier stage, the soul itself,\nits shifting fancies and celestial lights, more than any other poet\nof the age.  And he has worked with a thought-and-passion capital\ngreater than the combined thought-and-passion capital of the richest\nof his poetical contemporaries.  And he has thought nobly of the soul,\nand has treated it as, in its essence, above the fixed and law-bound\nsystem of things which we call nature; in other words,\nhe has treated it as supernatural.  “Mind,” he makes the Pope say,\nin ‘The Ring and the Book’,--and his poetry bears testimony to\nits being his own conviction and doctrine,--“Mind is not matter,\nnor from matter, but above.”  With every student of Browning,\nthe recognition and acceptance of this must be his starting-point.\nEven that which impelled the old dog, in his poem entitled ‘Tray’\n(‘Dramatic Lyrics’, First Series), to rescue the beggar child\nthat fell into the river, and then to dive after the child’s doll,\nand bring it up, after a long stay under water, the poet evidently\ndistinguishes from matter,--regards as “not matter nor from matter,\nbut above”:--\n\n     “And so, amid the laughter gay,\n     Trotted my hero off,--old Tray,--\n     Till somebody, prerogatived\n     With reason, reasoned:  ‘Why he dived,\n     His brain would show us, I should say.\n\n     ‘John, go and catch--or, if needs be,\n     Purchase that animal for me!\n     By vivisection, at expense\n     Of half-an-hour and eighteen pence,\n     How brain secretes dog’s soul, we’ll see!”\n\nIn his poem entitled ‘Halbert and Hob’ (‘Dramatic Lyrics’,\nFirst Series), quoting from Shakespeare’s ‘King Lear’,\n“Is there a reason in nature for these hard hearts?” the poet adds,\n“O Lear, That a reason OUT of nature must turn them soft, seems clear!”\n\nMind is, with Browning, SUPERNATURAL, but linked with,\nand restrained, and even enslaved by, the natural.  The soul,\nin its education, that is, in its awakening, becomes more and more\nindependent of the natural, and, as a consequence, more responsive to\nhigher souls and to the Divine.  ALL SPIRIT IS MUTUALLY ATTRACTIVE,\nand the degree of attractiveness results from the degree of freedom\nfrom the obstructions of the material, or the natural.\nLoving the truth implies a greater or less degree of that freedom\nof the spirit which brings it into SYMPATHY with the true.\n“If ye abide in My word,” says Christ (and we must understand by “word”\n His own concrete life, the word made flesh, and living and breathing),\n“if ye abide in My word” (that is, continue to live My life),\n“then are ye truly My disciples; and ye shall know the truth,\nand the truth shall make you free” (John viii. 32).\n\nIn regard to the soul’s INHERENT possessions, its microcosmic\npotentialities, Paracelsus is made to say (and this may be taken,\ntoo, as the poet’s own creed), “Truth is WITHIN ourselves;\nit takes no rise from outward things, whate’er you may believe:\nthere is an inmost centre in us all, where truth abides in fulness;\nand around, wall upon wall, the gross flesh hems it in,\nthis perfect, clear perception--which is truth.  A baffling\nand perverting carnal mesh blinds it, and makes all error:\nand, TO KNOW, rather consists in opening out a way whence\nthe imprisoned splendour may escape, than in effecting entry\nfor a light supposed to be without.”\n\nAll possible thought is IMPLICIT in the mind, and waiting\nfor release--waiting to become EXPLICIT.  “Seek within yourself,”\n says Goethe, “and you will find everything; and rejoice that, without,\nthere lies a Nature that says yea and amen to all you have discovered\nin yourself.”  And Mrs. Browning, in the person of Aurora Leigh,\nwrites:  “The cygnet finds the water; but the man is born\nin ignorance of his element, and feels out blind at first,\ndisorganized by sin in the blood,--his spirit-insight\ndulled and crossed by his sensations.  Presently we feel it\nquicken in the dark sometimes; then mark, be reverent, be obedient,--\nfor those dumb motions of imperfect life are oracles\nof vital Deity attesting the Hereafter.  Let who says\n‘The soul’s a clean white paper’, rather say, a palimpsest,\na prophet’s holograph defiled, erased, and covered by a monk’s,--\nthe Apocalypse by a Longus! poring on which obscure text,\nwe may discern perhaps some fair, fine trace of what was written once,\nsome off-stroke of an alpha and omega expressing the old Scripture.”\n\nThis “fair, fine trace of what was written once”, it was the mission\nof Christ, it is the mission of all great personalities,\nof all the concrete creations of Genius, to bring out into\ndistinctness and vital glow.  It is not, and cannot be, brought out,--\nand this fact is emphasized in the poetry of Browning,--\nit cannot be brought out, through what is born and resides in\nthe brain:  it is brought out, either directly or indirectly,\nby the attracting power of magnetic personalities, the ultimate,\nabsolute personality being the God-man, Christ, qea/nqrwpos.\n\nThe human soul is regarded in Browning’s poetry as\na complexly organized, individualized divine force,\ndestined to gravitate towards the Infinite.  How is this force,\nwith its numberless checks and counter-checks, its centripetal\nand centrifugal tendencies, best determined in its necessarily\noblique way?  How much earthly ballast must it carry,\nto keep it sufficiently steady, and how little, that it may not be\nweighed down with materialistic heaviness?  How much certainty\nmust it have of its course, and how much uncertainty,\nthat it may shun the “torpor of assurance”, *1* and not lose the vigor\nwhich comes of a dubious and obstructed road, “which who stands upon\nis apt to doubt if it’s indeed a road.” *2*  “Pure faith indeed,”\n says Bishop Blougram, to Gigadibs, the literary man, “you know not\nwhat you ask! naked belief in God the Omnipotent, Omniscient,\nOmnipresent, sears too much the sense of conscious creatures,\nto be borne.  It were the seeing him, no flesh shall dare.\nSome think, Creation’s meant to show him forth:  I say, it’s meant\nto hide him all it can, and that’s what all the blessed Evil’s for.\nIts use in time is to environ us, our breath, our drop of dew,\nwith shield enough against that sight till we can bear its stress.\nUnder a vertical sun, the exposed brain and lidless eye\nand disimprisoned heart less certainly would wither up at once,\nthan mind, confronted with the truth of Him.  But time and earth\ncase-harden us to live; the feeblest sense is trusted most:\nthe child feels God a moment, ichors o’er the place,\nplays on and grows to be a man like us.  With me, faith means\nperpetual unbelief kept quiet like the snake ‘neath Michael’s foot,\nwho stands calm just because he feels it writhe.” *3*\n\n    --\n     *1* ‘The Ring and the Book’, The Pope, v. 1853.\n\n     *2* ‘Bishop Blougram’s Apology’, vv. 198, 199.\n\n     *3* ‘Bishop Blougram’s Apology’, vv. 650-671.\n    --\n\nThere is a remarkable passage to the same effect in ‘Paracelsus’,\nin which Paracelsus expatiates on the “just so much of doubt\nas bade him plant a surer foot upon the sun-road.”\n\nAnd in ‘Easter Day’:--\n\n     “You must mix some uncertainty\n     With faith, if you would have faith BE.”\n\nAnd the good Pope in ‘The Ring and the Book’, alluding to the absence\nof true Christian soldiership, which is revealed by Pompilia’s case,\nsays:  “Is it not this ignoble CONFIDENCE, cowardly hardihood,\nthat dulls and damps, makes the old heroism impossible?\nUnless. . .what whispers me of times to come?  What if it be\nthe mission of that age my death will usher into life,\nto SHAKE THIS TORPOR OF ASSURANCE FROM OUR CREED,\nreintroduce the DOUBT discarded, bring the formidable danger back\nwe drove long ago to the distance and the dark?”\n\nTrue healthy doubt means, in Browning, that the spiritual nature\nis sufficiently quickened not to submit to the conclusions of\nthe insulated intellect.  It WILL reach out beyond them,\nand assert itself, whatever be the resistance offered by the intellect.\nMere doubt, without any resistance from the intuitive,\nnon-discursive side of our nature, is the dry-rot of the soul.\nThe spiritual functions are “smothered in surmise”.  Faith is not\na matter of blind belief, of slavish assent and acceptance,\nas many no-faith people seem to regard it.  It is what\nWordsworth calls it, “a passionate intuition”, and springs out of\nquickened and refined sentiment, out of inborn instincts which are\nas cultivable as are any other elements of our complex nature,\nand which, too, may be blunted beyond a consciousness\nof their possession.  And when one in this latter state\ndenies the reality of faith, he is not unlike one born blind\ndenying the reality of sight.\n\nA reiterated lesson in Browning’s poetry, and one that results from\nhis spiritual theory, is, that the present life is a tabernacle-life,\nand that it can be truly lived only as a tabernacle-life;\nfor only such a life is compatible with the ever-continued\naspiration and endeavor which is a condition of, and inseparable from,\nspiritual vitality.\n\nDomizia, in the tragedy of ‘Luria’, is made to say:--\n\n     “How inexhaustibly the spirit grows!\n     One object, she seemed erewhile born to reach\n     With her whole energies and die content,--\n     So like a wall at the world’s edge it stood,\n     With naught beyond to live for,--is that reached?--\n     Already are new undream’d energies\n     Outgrowing under, and extending farther\n     To a new object;--there’s another world!”\n\nThe dying John in ‘A Death in the Desert’, is made to say:--\n\n  “I say that man was made to grow, not stop;\n  That help he needed once, and needs no more,\n  Having grown up but an inch by, is withdrawn:\n  For he hath new needs, and new helps to these.\n  This imports solely, man should mount on each\n  New height in view; the help whereby he mounts,\n  The ladder-rung his foot has left, may fall,\n  Since all things suffer change save God the Truth.\n  Man apprehends him newly at each stage\n  Whereat earth’s ladder drops, its service done;\n  And nothing shall prove twice what once was proved.”\n\nAnd again:--\n\n  “Man knows partly but conceives beside,\n  Creeps ever on from fancies to the fact,\n  And in this striving, this converting air\n  Into a solid he may grasp and use,\n  Finds progress, man’s distinctive mark alone,\n  Not God’s, and not the beasts’:  God is, they are,\n  Man partly is and wholly hopes to be.\n  Such progress could no more attend his soul\n  Were all it struggles after found at first\n  And guesses changed to knowledge absolute,\n  Than motion wait his body, were all else\n  Than it the solid earth on every side,\n  Where now through space he moves from rest to rest.\n  Man, therefore, thus conditioned, must expect\n  He could not, what he knows now, know at first;\n  What he considers that he knows to-day,\n  Come but to-morrow, he will find misknown;\n  Getting increase of knowledge, since he learns\n  Because he lives, which is to be a man,\n  Set to instruct himself by his past self:\n  First, like the brute, obliged by facts to learn,\n  Next, as man may, obliged by his own mind,\n  Bent, habit, nature, knowledge turned to law.\n  God’s gift was that man should conceive of truth\n  And yearn to gain it, catching at mistake,\n  As midway help till he reach fact indeed.\n  The statuary ere he mould a shape\n  Boasts a like gift, the shape’s idea, and next\n  The aspiration to produce the same;\n  So, taking clay, he calls his shape thereout,\n  Cries ever, ‘Now I have the thing I see’:\n  Yet all the while goes changing what was wrought,\n  From falsehood like the truth, to truth itself.\n  How were it had he cried, ‘I see no face,\n  No breast, no feet i’ the ineffectual clay’?\n  Rather commend him that he clapped his hands,\n  And laughed, ‘It is my shape and lives again!’\n  Enjoyed the falsehood touched it on to truth,\n  Until yourselves applaud the flesh indeed\n  In what is still flesh-imitating clay.\n  Right in you, right in him, such way be man’s!\n  God only makes the live shape at a jet.\n  Will ye renounce this fact of creatureship?\n  The pattern on the Mount subsists no more,\n  Seemed awhile, then returned to nothingness,\n  But copies, Moses strove to make thereby\n  Serve still and are replaced as time requires:\n  By these make newest vessels, reach the type!\n  If ye demur, this judgment on your head,\n  Never to reach the ultimate, angels’ law,\n  Indulging every instinct of the soul\n  There where law, life, joy, impulse are one thing.”\n\nBrowning has given varied and beautiful expressions to these ideas\nthroughout his poetry.\n\nThe soul must rest in nothing this side of the infinite.\nIf it does rest in anything, however relatively noble\nthat thing may be, whether art, or literature, or science,\nor theology, even, it declines in vitality--it torpifies.\nHowever great a conquest the combatant may achieve in any\nof these arenas, “striding away from the huge gratitude,\nhis club shouldered, lion-fleece round loin and flank”, he must be\n“bound on the next new labour, height o’er height ever surmounting--\ndestiny’s decree!” *\n\n    --\n     * ‘Aristophanes’ Apology’, p. 31, English ed.\n    --\n\n          “Rejoice that man is hurled\n     From change to change unceasingly,\n     His soul’s wings never furled!” *\n\n    --\n     * ‘James Lee’s Wife’, sect. 6.\n    --\n\nBut this tabernacle-life, which should ever look ahead, has its claims\nwhich must not be ignored, and its standards which must not be\ntoo much above present conditions.  Man must “fit to the finite\nhis infinity” (‘Sordello’).  Life may be over-spiritual\nas well as over-worldly.  “Let us cry, ‘All good things are ours,\nnor soul helps flesh more, now, than flesh helps soul!’” *\nThe figure the poet employs in ‘The Ring and the Book’\nto illustrate the art process, may be as aptly applied to life itself--\nthe greatest of all arts.  The life-artist must know how to secure\nthe proper degree of malleability in this mixture of flesh and soul.\nHe must mingle gold with gold’s alloy, and duly tempering both effect\na manageable mass.  There may be too little of alloy in earth-life\nas well as too much--too little to work the gold and fashion it,\nnot into a ring, but ring-ward.  “On the earth the broken arcs;\nin the heaven a perfect round” (‘Abt Vogler’).  “Oh, if we draw\na circle premature, heedless of far gain, greedy for quick returns\nof profit, sure, bad is our bargain” (‘A Grammarian’s Funeral’).\n\n    --\n     * ‘Rabbi Ben Ezra’.\n    --\n\n‘An Epistle containing the Strange Medical Experiences of Karshish,\nthe Arab Physician’, is one of Browning’s most remarkable\npsychological studies.  It may be said to polarize the idea,\nso often presented in his poetry, that doubt is a condition\nof the vitality of faith.  In this poem, the poet has treated\na supposed case of a spiritual knowledge “increased beyond\nthe fleshly faculty--heaven opened to a soul while yet on earth,\nearth forced on a soul’s use while seeing heaven”, a spiritual state,\nless desirable and far less favorable to the true fulfilment\nof the purposes of earth-life, than that expressed\nin the following lines from ‘Easter Day’:--\n\n     “A world of spirit as of sense\n     Was plain to him, yet not TOO plain,\n     Which he could traverse, not remain\n     A GUEST IN:--else were permanent\n     Heaven on earth, which its gleams were meant\n     To sting with hunger for full light”, etc.\n\nThe Epistle is a subtle representation of a soul conceived with\nabsolute spiritual standards, while obliged to live in a world\nwhere all standards are relative and determined by the circumstances\nand limitations of its situation.\n\nThe spiritual life has been too distinctly revealed for\nfulfilling aright the purposes of earth-life, purposes which the soul,\nwhile in the flesh, must not ignore, since, in the words of\nRabbi Ben Ezra, “all good things are ours, nor soul helps flesh more,\nnow, than flesh helps soul.”  The poem may also be said\nto represent what is, or should be, the true spirit\nof the man of science.  In spite of what Karshish writes,\napologetically, he betrays his real attitude throughout,\ntowards the wonderful spiritual problem involved.\n\nIt is, as many of Browning’s Monologues are, a double picture--\none direct, the other reflected, and the reflected one is as distinct\nas the direct.  The composition also bears testimony to Browning’s\nown soul-healthfulness.  Though the spiritual bearing of things\nis the all-in-all, in his poetry, the robustness of his nature,\nthe fulness and splendid equilibrium of his life, protect him against\nan inarticulate mysticism.  Browning is, in the widest and deepest\nsense of the word, the healthiest of all living poets;\nand in general constitution the most Shakespearian.\n\nWhat he makes Shakespeare say, in the Monologue entitled\n‘At the Mermaid’, he could say, with perhaps greater truth,\nin his own person, than Shakespeare could have said it:--\n\n     “Have you found your life distasteful?\n     My life did and does smack sweet.\n     Was your youth of pleasure wasteful?\n     Mine I save and hold complete.\n     Do your joys with age diminish?\n     When mine fail me, I’ll complain.\n     Must in death your daylight finish?\n     My sun sets to rise again.\n\n     I find earth not gray but rosy,\n     Heaven not grim but fair of hue.\n     Do I stoop?  I pluck a posy.\n     Do I stand and stare?  All’s blue.”\n\nIt is the spirit expressed in these lines which has made his poetry\nso entirely CONSTRUCTIVE.  With the destructive spirit\nhe has no affinities.  The poetry of despair and poets with the dumps\nhe cannot away with.\n\nPerhaps the most comprehensive passage in Browning’s poetry,\nexpressive of his ideal of a complete man under the conditions\nof earth-life, is found in ‘Colombe’s Birthday’, Act IV.\nValence says of Prince Berthold:--\n\n“He gathers earth’s WHOLE GOOD into his arms, standing, as man, now,\nstately, strong and wise--marching to fortune, not surprised by her:\none great aim, like a guiding star above--which tasks strength,\nwisdom, stateliness, to lift his manhood to the height\nthat takes the prize; a prize not near--lest overlooking earth,\nhe rashly spring to seize it--nor remote, so that\nhe rests upon his path content:  but day by day, while shimmering\ngrows shine, and the faint circlet prophesies the orb,\nhe sees so much as, just evolving these, the stateliness, the wisdom,\nand the strength to due completion, will suffice this life,\nand lead him at his grandest to the grave.”\n\nBrowning fully recognizes, to use an expression in his\n‘Fra Lippo Lippi’, fully recognizes “the value and significance\nof flesh.”  A healthy and well-toned spiritual life is with him\nthe furthest removed from asceticism.  To the passage from\nhis ‘Rabbi Ben Ezra’ already quoted, “all good things are ours,\nnor soul helps flesh more, now, than flesh helps soul”,\nshould be added what David sings to Saul, in the poem entitled ‘Saul’.\nWas the full physical life ever more beautifully sung?\n\n          “Oh! our manhood’s prime vigour! no spirit feels waste,\n  Not a muscle is stopped in its playing, nor sinew unbraced.\n  Oh, the wild joys of living! the leaping from rock up to rock,\n  The strong rending of boughs from the fir-tree, the cool silver shock\n  Of the plunge in a pool’s living water, the hunt of the bear,\n  And the sultriness showing the lion is couched in his lair.\n  And the meal, the rich dates yellowed over with gold dust divine,\n  And the locust-flesh steeped in the pitcher, the full draught of wine,\n  And the sleep in the dried river-channel where bulrushes tell\n  That the water was wont to go warbling so softly and well.\n  How good is man’s life, the mere living! how fit to employ\n  All the heart and the soul and the senses for ever in joy!”\n\nThough this is said in the person of the beautiful shepherd-boy,\nDavid, whoever has lived any time with Browning, through his poetry,\nmust be assured that it is also an expression of the poet’s\nown experience of the glory of flesh.  He has himself been\nan expression of the fullest physical life:  and now,\nin his five and seventieth year, since the 7th of last May,\nhe preserves both mind and body in a magnificent vigor.\nIf his soul had been lodged in a sickly, rickety body,\nhe could hardly have written these lines from ‘Saul’.  Nor could he\nhave written ‘Caliban upon Setebos’, especially the opening lines:\n“Will sprawl, now that the heat of day is best, flat on his belly\nin the pit’s much mire, with elbows wide, fists clenched\nto prop his chin.  And, while he kicks both feet in the cool slush,\nand feels about his spine small eft-things course, run in and out\neach arm, and make him laugh:  and while above his head\na pompion-plant, coating the cave-top as a brow its eye,\ncreeps down to touch and tickle hair and beard, and now a flower drops\nwith a bee inside, and now a fruit to snap at, catch and crunch,--\nhe looks out o’er yon sea which sunbeams cross and recross\ntill they weave a spider-web (meshes of fire, some great fish breaks\nat times), and talks to his own self, howe’er he please,\ntouching that other, whom his dam called God.”\n\nThere’s a grand passage in ‘Balaustion’s Adventure:\nincluding a transcript from Euripides’, descriptive of Herakles\nas he returns, after his conflict with Death, leading back Alkestis,\nwhich shows the poet’s sympathy with the physical.  The passage is\nmore valuable as revealing that sympathy, from the fact that\nit’s one of his additions to Euripides:--\n\n                    “there stood the strength,\n     Happy as always; something grave, perhaps;\n     The great vein-cordage on the fret-worked brow,\n     Black-swollen, beaded yet with battle-drops\n     The yellow hair o’ the hero!--his big frame\n     A-quiver with each muscle sinking back\n     Into the sleepy smooth it leaped from late.\n     Under the great guard of one arm, there leant\n     A shrouded something, live and woman-like,\n     Propped by the heart-beats ‘neath the lion-coat.\n     When he had finished his survey, it seemed,\n     The heavings of the heart began subside,\n     The helping breath returned, and last the smile\n     Shone out, all Herakles was back again,\n     As the words followed the saluting hand.”\n\nIt is not so much the glory of flesh which Euripides represents\nin Herakles, as the indulgence of appetite, at a time, too,\nwhen that indulgence is made to appear the more culpable and gross.\n\nThis idea of “the value and significance of flesh”, it is important\nto note, along with the predominant spiritual bearing\nof Browning’s poetry.  It articulates everywhere the spiritual,\nso to speak--makes it healthy and robust, and protects it\nagainst volatility and from running into mysticism.\n\n\n\n\n2.  The Idea of Personality as embodied in Browning’s Poetry.\n\n\nA cardinal idea in Browning’s poetry is the regeneration of men\nthrough a personality who brings fresh stuff for them to mould,\ninterpret, and prove right,--new feeling fresh from God--\nwhose life re-teaches them what life should be, what faith is,\nloyalty and simpleness, all once revealed, but taught them\nso long since that they have but mere tradition of the fact,--\ntruth copied falteringly from copies faint, the early traits\nall dropped away.  (‘Luria’.)  The intellect plays a secondary part.\nIts place is behind the instinctive, spiritual antennae\nwhich conduct along their trembling lines, fresh stuff\nfor the intellect to stamp and keep--fresh instinct for it\nto translate into law.\n\n“A people is but the attempt of many to rise to the completer life\nof one.”  (‘A Soul’s Tragedy’.)\n\nOnly the man who supplies new feeling fresh from God,\nquickens and regenerates the race, and sets it on the King’s highway\nfrom which it has wandered into by-ways--not the man\nof mere intellect, of unkindled soul, that supplies only\nstark-naked thought.  Through the former, “God stooping shows\nsufficient of His light for those i’ the dark to rise by.”\n (‘R. and B., Pompilia’.)  In him men discern “the dawn of\nthe next nature, the new man whose will they venture in the place\nof theirs, and whom they trust to find them out new ways\nto the new heights which yet he only sees.”  (‘Luria’.)\nIt is by reaching towards, and doing fealty to, the greater spirit\nwhich attracts and absorbs their own, that, “trace by trace\nold memories reappear, old truth returns, their slow thought\ndoes its work, and all’s re-known.”  (‘Luria’.)\n\n               “Some existence like a pact\n     And protest against Chaos, . . .\n\n     . . . The fullest effluence of the finest mind,\n     All in degree, no way diverse in kind\n     From minds above it, minds which, more or less\n     Lofty or low, move seeking to impress\n     Themselves on somewhat; but one mind has climbed\n     Step after step, by just ascent sublimed.\n     Thought is the soul of act, and, stage by stage,\n     Is soul from body still to disengage,\n     As tending to a freedom which rejects\n     Such help, and incorporeally affects\n     The world, producing deeds but not by deeds,\n     Swaying, in others, frames itself exceeds,\n     Assigning them the simpler tasks it used\n     To patiently perform till Song produced\n     Acts, by thoughts only, for the mind:  divest\n     Mind of e’en Thought, and, lo, God’s unexpressed\n     Will dawns above us!”  (‘Sordello’.)\n\nA dangerous tendency of civilization is that towards crystallization--\ntowards hardened, inflexible conventionalisms which “refuse the soul\nits way”.\n\nSuch crystallization, such conventionalisms, yield only to\nthe dissolving power of the spiritual warmth of life-full personalities.\n\nThe quickening, regenerating power of personality is everywhere\nexhibited in Browning’s poetry.  It is emphasized in ‘Luria’,\nand in the Monologues of the Canon Caponsacchi and Pompilia,\nin the ‘Ring and the Book’; it shines out, or glints forth,\nin ‘Colombe’s Birthday’, in ‘Saul’, in ‘Sordello’, and in all\nthe Love poems.  I would say, en passant, that Love\nis always treated by Browning as a SPIRITUAL claim;\nwhile DUTY may be only a worldly one.  SEE especially the poem\nentitled ‘Bifurcation’.  In ‘Balaustion’s Adventure:\nincluding a transcipt from Euripides’, the regenerating power\nof personality may be said to be the leavening idea, which the poet\nhas introduced into the Greek play.  It is entirely absent\nin the original.  It baptizes, so to speak, the Greek play,\nand converts it into a Christian poem.  It is the “new truth”\n of the poet’s ‘Christmas Eve’.\n\nAfter the mourning friends have spoken their words of consolation\nto the bereaved husband, the last word being, “Dead, thy wife--\nliving, the love she left”, Admetos “turned on the comfort,\nwith no tears, this time.  HE WAS BEGINNING TO BE LIKE HIS WIFE.\nI told you of that pressure to the point, word slow pursuing word\nin monotone, Alkestis spoke with; so Admetos, now, solemnly bore\nthe burden of the truth.  And as the voice of him grew,\ngathered strength, and groaned on, and persisted to the end,\nwe felt how deep had been descent in grief, and WITH WHAT CHANGE\nHE CAME UP NOW TO LIGHT, and left behind such littleness as tears.”\n\nAnd when Alkestis was brought back by Herakles, “the hero\ntwitched the veil off:  and there stood, with such fixed eyes\nand such slow smile, Alkestis’ silent self!  It was the crowning grace\nof that great heart to keep back joy:  procrastinate the truth\nuntil the wife, who had made proof and found the husband wanting,\nmight essay once more, hear, see, and feel him RENOVATED now--\nABLE TO DO, NOW, ALL HERSELF HAD DONE, RISEN TO THE HEIGHT OF HER:\nso, hand in hand, the two might go together, live and die.”\n (Compare with this the restoration of Hermione to her husband,\nin ‘The Winter’s Tale’, Act V.)\n\nA good intellect has been characterized as the chorus of Divinity.\nSubstitute for “good intellect”, an exulted magnetic personality,\nand the thought is deepened.  An exalted magnetic personality\nis the chorus of Divinity, which, in the great Drama of Humanity,\nguides and interprets the feelings and sympathies of other souls\nand thus adjusts their attitudes towards the Divine.\nIt is not the highest function of such a personality to TEACH,\nbut rather to INFORM, in the earlier and deeper sense of the word.\nWhatever mere doctrine he may promulgate, is of inferior importance\nto the spontaneous action of his concrete life, in which the True,\nthe Beautiful, and the Good, breathe and live.  What is born\nin the brain dies there, it may be; at best, it does not,\nand cannot of itself, lead up to the full concrete life.\nIt is only through the spontaneou and unconscious fealty\nwhich an inferior does to a superior soul (a fealty resulting\nfrom the responsiveness of spirit to spirit), that the former\nis slowly and silently transformed into a more or less\napproximate image of the latter.  The stronger personality\nleads the weaker on by paths which the weaker knows not,\nupward he leads him, though his steps be slow and vacillating.\nHumility, in the Christian sense, means this fealty to the higher.\nIt doesn’t mean self-abasement, self-depreciation, as it has been\nunderstood to mean, by both the Romish and the Protestant Church.\nPride, in the Christian sense, is the closing of the doors of the soul\nto a great magnetic guest.\n\nBrowning beautifully expresses the transmission of personality\nin his ‘Saul’.  But according to Browning’s idea, personality cannot\nstrictly be said to be transmitted.  Personality rather\nevokes its LIKE from other souls, which are “all in degree,\nno way diverse in kind.”  (‘Sordello’.)\n\nDavid has reached an advanced stage in his symbolic song to Saul.\nHe thinks now what next he shall urge “to sustain him where song\nhad restored him?--Song filled to the verge his cup with the wine\nof this life, pressing all that it yields of mere fruitage,\nthe strength and the beauty:  beyond, on what fields glean a vintage\nmore potent and perfect to brighten the eye and bring blood to the lip,\nand commend them the cup they put by?”  So once more\nthe string of the harp makes response to his spirit, and he sings:--\n\n  “In our flesh grows the branch of this life, in our soul it bears fruit.\n  Thou hast marked the slow rise of the tree,--how its stem\n            trembled first\n  Till it passed the kid’s lip, the stag’s antler; then safely outburst\n  The fan-branches all round; and thou mindest when these, too, in turn\n  Broke a-bloom and the palm-tree seemed perfect; yet more was to learn,\n  E’en the good that comes in with the palm-fruit.  Our dates\n            shall we slight,\n  When their juice brings a cure for all sorrow? or care for the plight\n  Of the palm’s self whose slow growth produced them?  Not so!\n            stem and branch\n  Shall decay, nor be known in their place, while the palm-wine\n            shall staunch\n  Every wound of man’s spirit in winter.  I pour thee such wine.\n  Leave the flesh to the fate it was fit for! the spirit be thine!\n  By the spirit, when age shall o’ercome thee, thou still shalt enjoy\n  More indeed, than at first when, inconscious, the life of a boy.\n  Crush that life, and behold its wine running! each deed thou hast done\n  Dies, revives, goes to work in the world; until e’en as the sun\n  Looking down on the earth, though clouds spoil him,\n            though tempests efface,\n  Can find nothing his own deed produced not, must everywhere trace\n  The results of his past summer-prime,--SO, EACH RAY OF THY WILL,\n  EVERY FLASH OF THY PASSION AND PROWESS, LONG OVER, SHALL THRILL\n  THY WHOLE PEOPLE, THE COUNTLESS, WITH ARDOUR, TILL THEY TOO GIVE FORTH\n  A LIKE CHEER TO THEIR SONS:  WHO IN TURN, FILL THE SOUTH AND THE NORTH\n  WITH THE RADIANCE THY DEED WAS THE GERM OF.”\n\nIn the concluding lines is set forth what might be characterized as\nthe apostolic succession of a great personality--the succession\nof those “who in turn fill the South and the North with the radiance\nhis deed was the germ of.”\n\nWhat follows in David’s song gives expression to the other mode\nof transmitting a great personality--that is, through records\nthat “give unborn generations their due and their part in his being”,\nand also to what those records owe their effectiveness, and are saved\nfrom becoming a dead letter.\n\n  “Is Saul dead?  In the depth of the vale make his tomb--bid arise\n  A grey mountain of marble heaped four-square, till, built to the skies,\n  Let it mark where the great First King slumbers:  whose fame\n            would ye know?\n  Up above see the rock’s naked face, where the record shall go\n  In great characters cut by the scribe,--Such was Saul, so he did;\n  With the sages directing the work, by the populace chid,--\n  For not half, they’ll affirm, is comprised there!  Which fault to amend,\n  In the grove with his kind grows the cedar, whereon they shall spend\n  (See, in tablets ‘tis level before them) their praise, and record\n  With the gold of the graver, Saul’s story,--the statesman’s great word\n  Side by side with the poet’s sweet comment.  The river’s a-wave\n  With smooth paper-reeds grazing each other when prophet-winds rave:\n  So the pen gives unborn generations their due and their part\n  In thy being!  Then, first of the mighty, thank God that thou art!”\n\nWhat is said in this passage is applicable to the record we have\nof Christ’s life upon earth.  Christianity has only to\na very limited extent been perpetuated through the letter of\nthe New Testament.  It has been perpetuated chiefly through\ntransmissions of personalities, through apostolic succession,\nin a general sense, and through embodiments of his spirit\nin art and literature--“the stateman’s great word”,\n“the poet’s sweet comment”.  Were it not for this transmission\nof the quickening power of personality, the New Testament would be\nto a great extent a dead letter.  It owes its significance to\nthe quickened spirit which is brought to the reading of it.\nThe personality of Christ could not be, through a plastic sympathy,\nmoulded out of the New Testament records, without the aid\nof intermediate personalities.\n\nThe Messianic idea was not peculiar to the Jewish race--\nthe idea of a Person gathering up within himself, in an effective\nfulness and harmony, the restorative elements of humanity, which have\nlost their power through dispersion and consequent obscuration.\nThere have been Messiahs of various orders and ranks in every age,--\ngreat personalities that have realized to a greater or less extent\n(though there has been but one, the God-Man, who fully realized),\nthe spiritual potentialities in man, that have stood upon\nthe sharpest heights as beacons to their fellows.  In the individual\nthe species has, as it were, been gathered up, epitomized,\nand intensified, and he has thus been a prophecy, and to some extent\na fulfilment of human destiny.\n\n“A poet must be earth’s ESSENTIAL king”, as Sordello asserts,\nand he is that by virtue of his exerting or shedding the influence of\nhis essential personality.  “If caring not to exert the proper essence\nof his royalty, he, the poet, trifle malapert with accidents instead--\ngood things assigned as heralds of a better thing behind”--he is\n“deposed from his kingly throne, and his glory is taken from him”.\nOf himself, Sordello says:  “The power he took most pride to test,\nwhereby all forms of life had been professed at pleasure,\nforms already on the earth, was but a means of power beyond,\nwhose birth should, in its novelty, be kingship’s proof.  Now,\nwhether he came near or kept aloof the several forms he longed\nto imitate, not there the kingship lay, he sees too late.  Those forms,\nunalterable first as last, proved him her copier, not the protoplast\nof nature:  what could come of being free by action to exhibit\ntree for tree, bird, beast, for beast and bird, or prove earth bore\none veritable man or woman more?  Means to an end such proofs are:\nwhat the end?”\n\nThe answer given involves the great Browning idea of\nthe quickening power of personality:  “Let essence, whatsoe’er it be,\nextend--never contract!”\n\nBy “essence” we must understand that which “constitutes man’s self,\nis what Is”, as the dying John, in ‘A Death in the Desert’,\nexpresses it--that which backs the active powers and\nthe conscious intellect, “subsisting whether they assist or no”.\n\n“Let essence, whatsoe’er it be, extend--never contract!”\n Sordello says.  “Already you include the multitude”; that is,\nyou gather up in yourself, in an effective fulness and harmony,\nwhat lies scattered and ineffective in the multitude;\n“then let the mulitude include yourself”; that is, be substantiated,\nessenced with yourself; “and the result were new:  themselves before,\nthe multitude turn YOU” (become yourself).  “This were to live\nand move and have, in them, your being, and secure a diadem\nyou should transmit (because no cycle yearns beyond itself,\nbut on itself returns) when the full sphere in wane,\nthe world o’erlaid long since with you, shall have in turn obeyed\nsome orb still prouder, some displayer, still more potent than\nthe last, of human will, and some new king depose the old.”\n\nThis is a most important passage to get hold of in studying Browning.\nIt may be said to gather up Browning’s philosophy of life in a nutshell.\n\nThere’s a passage to the same effect in ‘Balaustion’s Adventure’,\nin regard to the transmission of the poet’s essence.  The enthusiastic\nRhodian girl, Balaustion, after she has told the play of Euripides,\nyears after her adventure, to her four friends, Petale,\nPhullis, Charope, and Chrusion, says:--\n\n“I think I see how. . . you, I, or any one, might mould a new Admetos,\nnew Alkestis.  Ah, that brave bounty of poets, the one royal race\nthat ever was, or will be, in this world!  They give no gift that\nbounds itself, and ends i’ the giving and the taking:\ntheirs so breeds i’ the heart and soul of the taker, so transmutes\nthe man who only was a man before, that he grows god-like in his turn,\ncan give--he also:  share the poet’s privilege, bring forth new good,\nnew beauty from the old.  As though the cup that gave the wine,\ngave too the god’s prolific giver of the grape, that vine,\nwas wont to find out, fawn around his footstep, springing still\nto bless the dearth, at bidding of a Mainad.”\n\n\n\n\n3.  Art as an Intermediate Agency of Personality.\n\n\nIf Browning’s idea of the quickening, the regeneration,\nthe rectification of personality, through a higher personality,\nbe fully comprehended, his idea of the great function of Art,\nas an intermediate agency of personality, will become plain.\nTo emphasize the latter idea may be said to be the ultimate purpose\nof his masterpiece, ‘The Ring and the Book’.\n\nThe complexity of the circumstances involved in the Roman murder case,\nadapts it admirably to the poet’s purpose--namely, to exhibit\nthe swervings of human judgment in spite of itself, and the conditions\nupon which the rectification of that judgment depends.\n\nThis must be taken, however, as only the articulation,\nthe framework, of the great poem.  It is richer in materials,\nof the most varied character, than any other long poem in existence.\nTo notice one feature of the numberless features of the poem,\nwhich might be noticed, Browning’s deep and subtle insight\ninto the genius of the Romish Church is shown in it more fully\nthan in any other of his poems,--though special phases of that genius\nare distinctly exhibited in numerous poems:  a remarkable one being\n‘The Bishop orders his Tomb at St. Praxed’s Church’.\nIt is questionable whether any work of any kind has ever exhibited\nthat genius more fully and distinctly than ‘The Ring and the Book’\nexhibits it.  The reader breathes throughout the ecclesiastical\natmosphere of the Eternal City.\n\nTo return from this digression, the several monologues\nof which the poem consists, with the exception of those\nof the Canon Caponsacchi, Pompilia, and the Pope, are each curious\nand subtle and varied exponents of the workings, without the guidance\nof instinct at the heart, of the prepossessed, prejudiced intellect,\nand of the sources of its swerving into error.  What is said\nof the “feel after the vanished truth” in the monologue entitled\n‘Half Rome’--the speaker being a jealous husband--will serve\nto characterize, in a general way, “the feel after truth”\n exhibited in the other monologues:  “honest enough, as the way is:\nall the same, harboring in the CENTRE OF ITS SENSE a hidden germ\nof failure, shy but sure, should neutralize that honesty and leave\nthat feel for truth at fault, as the way is too.  Some prepossession,\nsuch as starts amiss, by but a hair’s-breadth at the shoulder-blade,\nthe arm o’ the feeler, dip he ne’er so brave; and so leads waveringly,\nlets fall wide o’ the mark his finger meant to find, and fix truth\nat the bottom, that deceptive speck.”\n\nThe poet could hardly have employed a more effective metaphor\nin which to embody the idea of mental swerving.  The several monologues\nall going over the same ground, are artistically justified\nin their exhibiting, each of them, a quite distinct form\nof this swerving.  For the ultimate purpose of the poet,\nit needed to be strongly emphasized.  The student of the poem\nis amazed, long before he gets over all these monologues,\nat the Protean capabilities of the poet’s own intellect.\nIt takes all conceivable attitudes toward the case, and each seems\nto be a perfectly easy one.\n\nThese monologues all lead up to the great moral of the poem, which is\nexplicitly set forth at the end, namely, “that our human speech\nis naught, our human testimony false, our fame and human estimation,\nwords and wind.  Why take the artistic way to prove so much?  Because,\nit is the glory and good of Art, that Art remains the one way possible\nof speaking truth, to mouths like mine, at least.  How look a brother\nin the face and say, Thy right is wrong, eyes hast thou yet art blind,\nthine ears are stuffed and stopped, despite their length:  and, oh,\nthe foolishness thou countest faith!  Say this as silvery\nas tongue can troll--the anger of the man may be endured,\nthe shrug, the disappointed eyes of him are not so bad to bear--\nbut here’s the plague, that all this trouble comes of telling truth,\nwhich truth, by when it reaches him, looks false, seems to be\njust the thing it would supplant, nor recognizable by whom it left:\nwhile falsehood would have done the work of truth.  But Art,--\nwherein man nowise speaks to men, only to mankind,--Art may tell\na truth obliquely, DO THE THING SHALL BREED THE THOUGHT”, that is,\nbring what is IMPLICIT within the soul, into the right attitude\nto become EXPLICIT--bring about a silent adjustment\nthrough sympathy induced by the concrete; in other words,\nprepare the way for the perception of the truth--\n“do the thing shall breed the thought, nor wrong the thought\nmissing the mediate word”; meaning, that Art, so to speak,\nis the word made flesh,--IS the truth, and, as Art,\nhas nothing directly to do with the explicit.  “So may you paint\nyour picture, twice show truth, beyond mere imagery on the wall,--\nso, note by note, bring music from your mind, deeper than ever\nthe Andante dived,--so write a book shall mean beyond the facts,\nsuffice the eye and save the soul beside.”\n\nAnd what is the inference the poet would have us draw\nfrom this passage?  It is, that the life and efficacy of Art\ndepends on the personality of the artist, which “has informed,\ntranspierced, thridded, and so thrown fast the facts else free,\nas right through ring and ring runs the djereed and binds the loose,\none bar without a break.”  And it is really this fusion of\nthe artist’s soul, which kindles, quickens, INFORMS those who\ncontemplate, respond to, reproduce sympathetically within themselves\nthe greater spirit which attracts and absorbs their own.\nThe work of Art is apocalyptic of the artist’s own personality.\nIt CANNOT be impersonal.  As is the temper of his spirit, so is,\nMUST be, the temper of his Art product.*  It is hard to believe,\nalmost impossible to believe, that ‘Titus Andronicus’ could have been\nwritten by Shakespeare, the external testimony to the authorship,\nnotwithstanding.  Even if he had written it as a burlesque\nof such a play as Marlow’s ‘Jew of Malta’, he could not have avoided\nsome revelation of that sense of moral proportion which is omnipresent\nin his Plays.  But I can find no Shakespeare in ‘Titus Andronicus’.\nAre we not certain what manner of man Shakespeare was from his Works\n(notwithstanding that critics are ever asserting their impersonality)\n--far more certain than if his biography had been written\nby one who knew him all his life, and sustained to him\nthe most intimate relations?  We know Shakespeare--or he CAN\nbe known, if the requisite conditions are met, better, perhaps,\nthan any other great author that ever lived--know,\nin the deepest sense of the word, in a sense other than that in which\nwe know Dr. Johnson, through Boswell’s Biography.  The moral proportion\nwhich is so signal a characteristic of his Plays could not have been\nimparted to them by the conscious intellect.  It was SHED from\nhis spiritual constitution.\n\n--\n * “And long it was not after, when I was confirmed in this opinion,\n that he who would not be frustrate of his hope to write well hereafter\n in laudable things, ought himself to be a true poem.”\n --Milton’s ‘Apology for Sinectymnuus’.\n--\n\nBy “speaking truth” in Art’s way, Browning means, inducing a right\nATTITUDE toward, a full and free SYMPATHY with, the True,\nwhich is a far more important and effective way of speaking truth\nthan delivering truth ‘in re’.  A work of Art, worthy of the name,\nneed not be true to fact, but must be true in its spiritual attitude,\nand being thus true, it will tend to induce a corresponding attitude\nin those who do fealty to it.  It will have the influence,\nthough in an inferior degree, it may be, of a magnetic personality.\nPersonality is the ultimate source of spiritual quickening\nand adjustment.  Literature and all forms of Art are but\nthe intermediate agencies of personalities.  The artist cannot be\nseparated from his art.  As is the artist so MUST be his art.\nThe ‘aura’, so to speak, of a great work of Art, must come from\nthe artist’s own personality.  The spiritual worth of Shakespeare’s\n‘Winter’s Tale’ is not at all impaired by the fact that Bohemia is made\na maritime country, that Whitsun pastorals and Christian burial,\nand numerous other features of Shakespeare’s own age, are introduced\ninto pagan times, that Queen Hermione speaks of herself as a daughter\nof the Emperor of Russia, that her statue is represented as executed by\nJulio Romano, an Italian painter of the 16th century, that a puritan\nsings psalms to hornpipes, and, to crown all, that messengers are sent\nto consult the oracle of Apollo, at Delphi, which is represented as\nan island!  All this jumble, this gallimaufry, I say,\ndoes not impair the spiritual worth of the play.  As an Art-product,\nit invites a rectified attitude toward the True and the Sweet.\n\nIf we look at the letter of the trial scene in ‘The Merchant of Venice’,\nit borders on the absurd; but if we look at its spirit,\nwe see the Shakespearian attitude of soul which makes for righteousness,\nfor the righteousness which is inherent in the moral constitution\nof the universe.\n\nThe inmost, secretest life of Shakespeare’s Plays came from\nthe personality, the inmost, secretest life, of the man Shakespeare.\nWe might, with the most alert sagacity, note and tabulate and aggregate\nhis myriad phenomenal merits as a dramatic writer, but we might still\nbe very far from that something back of them all, or rather that\nIMMANENT something, that mystery of personality, that microcosmos,\nthat “inmost centre, where truth abides in fulness”, as Browning makes\nParacelsus characterize it, “constituting man’s self, is what Is”,\nas he makes the dying John characterize it, in ‘A Death in the Desert’,\nthat “innermost of the inmost, most interior of the interne”,\nas Mrs. Browning characterizes it, “the hidden Soul”,\nas Dallas characterizes it, which is projected into, and constitutes\nthe soul of, the Plays, and which is reached through an unconscious\nand mystic sympathy on the part of him who habitually communes with\nand does fealty to them.  That personality, that living force,\nco-operated spontaneously and unconsciously with the conscious powers,\nin the creative process; and when we enter into a sympathetic communion\nwith the concrete result of that creative process, our own\nmysterious personalities, being essentially identical with,\nthough less quickened than, Shakespeare’s, respond, though it may be\nbut feebly, to his.  This response is the highest result of the study\nof Shakespeare’s works.\n\nIt is a significant fact that Shakespearian critics and editors,\nfor nearly two centuries, have been a ‘genus irritabile’,\nto which genus Shakespeare himself certainly did not belong.\nThe explanation may partly be, that they have been too much occupied\nwith the LETTER, and have fretted their nerves in angry dispute\nabout readings and interpretations; as theologians have done\nin their study of the sacred records, instead of endeavoring to reach,\nthrough the letter, the personality of which the letter is but\na manifestation more or less imperfect.  To KNOW a personality is,\nof course, a spiritual knowledge--the result of sympathy,\nthat is, spiritual responsiveness.  Intellectually it is\nbut little more important to know one rather than another personality.\nThe highest worth of all great works of genius is due to the fact\nthat they are apocalyptic of great personalities.\n\nArt says, as the Divine Person said, whose personality\nand the personalities fashioned after it, have transformed and moulded\nthe ages, “Follow me!”  Deep was the meaning wrapt up in this command:\nit was, Do as I do, live as I live, not from an intellectual perception\nof the principles involved in my life, but through a full sympathy,\nthrough the awakening, vitalizing, actuating power of\nthe incarnate Word.\n\nArt also says, as did the voice from the wilderness,\ninadequately translated, “REPENT ye, for the kingdom of heaven\nis at hand”.  (Metanoei^te h’/ggike ga\\r h‘ Basilei/a tw^n ou’ranw^n.)\nRather, be transformed, or, as De Quincey puts it, “Wheel into\na new centre your spiritual system; GEOCENTRIC has that system been\nup to this hour--that is, having earth and the earthly\nfor its starting-point; henceforward make it HELIOCENTRIC (that is,\nwith the sun, or the heavenly, for its principle of motion).”\n\nThe poetry of Browning everywhere says this, and says it\nmore emphatically than that of any other poet in our literature.\nIt says everywhere, that not through knowledge, not through\na sharpened intellect, but through repentance, in the deeper sense\nto which I have just alluded, through conversion, through wheeling into\na new centre its spiritual system, the soul attains to saving truth.\nSalvation with him means that revelation of the soul to itself,\nthat awakening, quickening, actuating, attitude-adjusting, of the soul,\nwhich sets it gravitating toward the Divine.\n\nBrowning’s idea of Conversion is, perhaps, most distinctly expressed\nin a passage in the Monologue of the Canon Caponsacchi,\nin ‘The Ring and the Book’, wherein he sets forth the circumstances\nunder which his soul was wheeled into a new centre, after a life\nof dalliance and elegant folly, and made aware of “the marvellous dower\nof the life it was gifted and filled with”.  He has been telling\nthe judges, before whom he has been summoned, the story of the letters\nforged by Guido to entrap him and Pompilia, and of his having seen\n“right through the thing that tried to pass for truth and solid,\nnot an empty lie”.  The conclusion and the resolve he comes to,\nare expressed in the soliloquy which he repeats to the judges,\nas having uttered at the time:  “So, he not only forged\nthe words for her but words for me, made letters he called mine:\nwhat I sent, he retained, gave these in place, all by\nthe mistress messenger!  As I recognized her, at potency of truth,\nso she, by the crystalline soul, knew me, never mistook the signs.\nEnough of this--let the wraith go to nothingness again,\nhere is the orb, have only thought for her!”  What follows admits us\nto the very HEART of Browning’s poetry--admits us to the great Idea\nwhich is almost, in these days, strange to say, peculiarly his--\nwhich no other poet, certainly, of this intellectual, analytic,\nscientific age, with its “patent, truth-extracting processes”,\nhas brought out with the same degree of distinctness--the great Idea\nwhich may be variously characterized as that of soul-kindling,\nsoul-quickening, adjustment of soul-attitude, regeneration, conversion,\nthrough PERSONALITY--a kindling, quickening, adjustment,\nregeneration, conversion in which THOUGHT is not even a coefficient.\nAs expressed in Sordello, “Divest mind of e’en thought, and lo,\nGod’s unexpressed will dawns above us!”  “Thought?” the Canon goes on\nto say, “Thought? nay, Sirs, what shall follow was not thought:\nI have thought sometimes, and thought long and hard.\nI have stood before, gone round a serious thing, tasked my whole mind\nto touch it and clasp it close, . . .  God and man, and what duty\nI owe both,--I dare say I have confronted these in thought:\nbut no such faculty helped here.  I put forth no thought,--powerless,\nall that night I paced the city:  it was the first Spring.\nBy the INVASION I LAY PASSIVE TO, in rushed new things,\nthe old were rapt away; alike abolished--the imprisonment of\nthe outside air, the inside weight o’ the world that pulled me down.\nDeath meant, to spurn the ground, soar to the sky,--die well\nand you do that.  The very immolation made the bliss;\ndeath was the heart of life, and all the harm my folly had crouched\nto avoid, now proved a veil hiding all gain my wisdom strove to grasp.\n. . .  Into another state, under new rule I knew myself was passing\nswift and sure; whereof the initiatory pang approached,\nfelicitous annoy, as bitter-sweet as when the virgin band,\nthe victors chaste, feel at the end the earthy garments drop,\nand rise with something of a rosy shame into immortal nakedness:\nso I lay, and let come the proper throe would thrill into the ecstasy\nand out-throb pain.  I’ the gray of the dawn it was I found myself\nfacing the pillared front o’ the Pieve--mine, my church:\nit seemed to say for the first time, ‘But am not I the Bride,\nthe mystic love o’ the Lamb, who took thy plighted troth, my priest,\nto fold thy warm heart on my heart of stone and freeze thee\nnor unfasten any more?  This is a fleshly woman,--let the free\nbestow their life blood, thou art pulseless now!’ . . .  Now,\nwhen I found out first that life and death are means to an end,\nthat passion uses both, indisputably mistress of the man whose form\nof worship is self-sacrifice--now, from the stone lungs sighed\nthe scrannel voice, ‘Leave that live passion, come be dead with me!’\nAs if, i’ the fabled garden, I had gone on great adventure,\nplucked in ignorance hedge-fruit, and feasted to satiety,\nlaughing at such high fame for hips and haws, and scorned\nthe achievement:  then come all at once o’ the prize o’ the place,\nthe thing of perfect gold, the apple’s self:  and, scarce my eye\non that, was ‘ware as well of the sevenfold dragon’s watch.  Sirs,\nI obeyed.  Obedience was too strange,--this new thing that had been\nSTRUCK INTO ME BY THE LOOK OF THE LADY, to dare disobey\nthe first authoritative word.  ‘Twas God’s.  I had been\nLIFTED TO THE LEVEL OF HER, could take such sounds into my sense.\nI said, ‘We two are cognizant o’ the Master now; it is she bids me\nbow the head:  how true, I am a priest!  I see the function here;\nI thought the other way self-sacrifice:  this is the true,\nseals up the perfect sum.  I pay it, sit down, silently obey.’”\n\nNumerous and varied expressions of the idea of conversion set forth\nin this passage, occur in Browning’s poetry, evidencing his deep sense\nof this great and indispensable condition of soul-life,\nof being born anew (or from above, as it should be rendered\nin the Gospel, a’/nwqen, that is, through the agency of\na higher personality), in order to see the kingdom of God--\nevidencing his conviction that “the kingdom of God cometh not\nwith observation:  for lo! the kingdom of God is within you.”\n In the poem entitled ‘Cristina’, the speaker is made to say,--\n\n  “Oh, we’re sunk enough here, God knows! but not quite so sunk\n            that moments,\n  Sure tho’ seldom, are denied us, when the spirit’s true endowments\n  Stand out plainly from its false ones, and apprise it if pursuing\n  Or the right way or the wrong way, to its triumph or undoing.\n\n  There are flashes struck from midnights, there are fire-flames\n            noon-days kindle,\n  Whereby piled-up honors perish, whereby swollen ambitions dwindle,\n  While just this or that poor impulse, which for once had play unstifled,\n  Seems the sole work of a life-time that away the rest have trifled.”\n\nAnd again, when the Pope in ‘The Ring and the Book’ has come\nto the decision to sign the death-warrant of Guido and his accomplices,\nhe says:  “For the main criminal I have no hope except in such\na SUDDENNESS OF FATE.  I stood at Naples once, a night so dark\nI could have scarce conjectured there was earth anywhere, sky or sea\nor world at all:  but the night’s black was burst through by a blaze--\nthunder struck blow on blow, earth groaned and bore,\nthrough her whole length of mountain visible:  there lay the city\nthick and plain with spires, and, like a ghost disshrouded,\nwhite the sea.  SO MAY THE TRUTH BE FLASHED OUT BY ONE BLOW,\nAND GUIDO SEE, ONE INSTANT, AND BE SAVED.  Else I avert my face,\nnor follow him into that sad obscure sequestered state\nwhere God UNMAKES BUT TO REMAKE the soul he else made first in vain;\nwhich must not be.  Enough, for I may die this very night:\nand how should I dare die, this man let live?  Carry this forthwith\nto the Governor!”\n\nBrowning is the most essentially Christian of living poets.\nThough he rarely speaks ‘in propria persona’ in his poetry,\nany one who has gone over it all, can have no doubt as to his own\nmost vital beliefs.  What the Beauty-loving Soul in Tennyson’s\n‘Palace of Art’ say of herself, cannot be suspected even,\nof Browning:--\n\n     “I take possession of man’s mind and deed.\n     I care not what the sects may brawl.\n     I sit as God holding no form of creed,\n     But contemplating all.”\n\nReligion with him is, indeed, the all-in-all; but not any\nparticular form of it as a finality.  This is not a world\nfor finalities of any kind, as he constantly teaches us:\nit is a world of broken arcs, not of perfect rounds.\nFormulations of some kind he would, no doubt, admit there must be,\nas in everything else; but with him all formulations and tabulations\nof beliefs, especially such as “make square to a finite eye\nthe circle of infinity”, *1* are, at the best, only PROVISIONAL,\nand, at the worst, lead to spiritual standstill, spiritual torpor,\n“a ghastly smooth life, dead at heart.” *2*  The essential nature\nof Christianity is contrary to special prescription, do this or do that,\nbelieve this or believe that.  Christ gave no recipes.\nChristianity is with Browning, and this he sets forth again and again,\na LIFE, quickened and motived and nourished by the Personality of Christ.\nAnd all that he says of this Personality can be accepted\nby every Christian, whatever theological view he may entertain of Christ.\nChrist’s teachings he regards but as INCIDENTS of that Personality,\nand the records we have of his sayings and doings, but a fragment,\na somewhat distorted one, it may be, out of which we must,\nby a mystic and plastic sympathy, {*} aided by the Christ spirit\nwhich is immanent in the Christian world, mould the Personality,\nand do fealty to it.  The Christian must endeavor to be able to say,\nwith the dying John, in Browning’s ‘Death in the Desert’,\n“To me that story,--ay, that Life and Death of which I wrote ‘it was’--\nto me, it is.”\n\n  --\n   *1*  ‘Christmas Eve’.\n   *2*  ‘Easter Day’.\n   {*} ‘plastic’ in the 1800’s sense of ‘pliable’, not ‘fake’.--A.L.\n  --\n\nThe poem entitled ‘Christmas Eve’ contains the fullest\nand most explicit expression, in Browning, of his idea\nof the personality of Christ, as being the all-in-all of Christianity.\n\n               “The truth in God’s breast\n  Lies trace for trace upon ours impressed:\n  Though He is so bright and we so dim,\n  We are made in His image to witness Him:\n  And were no eye in us to tell,\n  Instructed by no inner sense,\n  The light of Heaven from the dark of Hell,\n  That light would want its evidence,--\n  Though Justice, Good, and Truth, were still\n  Divine, if, by some demon’s will,\n  Hatred and wrong had been proclaimed\n  Law through the worlds, and Right misnamed,\n  No mere exposition of morality\n  Made or in part or in totality,\n  Should win you to give it worship, therefore:\n  And if no better proof you will care for,\n--Whom do you count the worst man upon earth?\n  Be sure, he knows, in his conscience, more\n  Of what Right is, than arrives at birth\n  In the best man’s acts that we bow before:\n  And thence I conclude that the real God-function\n  Is to furnish a motive and injunction\n  For practising what we know already.\n  And such an injunction and such a motive\n  As the God in Christ, do you waive, and ‘heady,\n  High-minded’, hang your tablet votive\n  Outside the fane on a finger-post?\n  Morality to the uttermost,\n  Supreme in Christ as we all confess,\n  Why need WE prove would avail no jot\n  To make Him God, if God he were not?\n  Where is the point where Himself lays stress?\n  Does the precept run ‘Believe in Good,\n  In Justice, Truth, now understood\n  For the first time’?--or ‘Believe in ME,\n  Who lived and died, yet essentially\n  Am Lord of Life’?*  Whoever can take\n  The same to his heart and for mere love’s sake\n  Conceive of the love,--that man obtains\n  A new truth; no conviction gains\n  Of an old one only, made intense\n  By a fresh appeal to his faded sense.”\n\n    --\n     * “Subsists no law of life outside of life.”\n              . . . . .\n       “The Christ himself had been no Lawgiver,\n       Unless he had given the LIFE, too, with the law.”\n                                Mrs. Browning’s ‘Aurora Leigh’.\n    --\n\nIf all Christendom could take this remarkable poem of ‘Christmas Eve’\nto its heart, its tolerance, its Catholic spirit, and, more than all,\nthe fealty it exhibits to the Personality who essentially is\nLord of Life, what a revolution it would undergo! and what a mass\nof dogmatic and polemic theology would become utterly obsolete!\nThe most remarkable thing, perhaps, about the vast body\nof Christian theology which has been developed during\nthe eighteen centuries which have elapsed since Christ\nwas in the flesh, is, that it is occupied so largely, it might almost\nbe said, exclusively, with what Christ and his disciples TAUGHT,\nand with fierce discussions about the manifold meanings which have been\ningeniously extorted from the imperfect RECORD of what he taught.\nBritish museum libraries of polemics have been written in defence\nof what Christ himself would have been indifferent to,\nand written with an animosity towards opponents which has been\ncrystallized in a phrase now applied in a general way\nto any intense hate--ODIUM THEOLOGICUM.\n\nIf the significance of Christ’s mission, or a large part of it,\nis to be estimated by his teachings, from those teachings\nimportant deductions must be made, as many of them had been delivered\nlong before his time.\n\nBrowning has something to say on this point, in this same poem\nof ‘Christmas Eve’:--\n\n  “Truth’s atmosphere may grow mephitic\n  When Papist struggles with Dissenter,\n  Impregnating its pristine clarity,\n--One, by his daily fare’s vulgarity,\n  Its gust of broken meat and garlic;\n--One, by his soul’s too-much presuming\n  To turn the frankincense’s fuming\n  An vapors of the candle starlike\n  Into the cloud her wings she buoys on.\n  Each that thus sets the pure air seething,\n  May poison it for healthy breathing--\n  But the Critic leaves no air to poison;\n  Pumps out by a ruthless ingenuity\n  Atom by atom, and leaves you--vacuity.\n  Thus much of Christ, does he reject?\n  And what retain?  His intellect?\n  What is it I must reverence duly?\n  Poor intellect for worship, truly,\n  Which tells me simply what was told\n  (If mere morality, bereft\n  Of the God in Christ, be all that’s left)\n  Elsewhere by voices manifold;\n  With this advantage, that the stater\n  Made nowise the important stumble\n  Of adding, he, the sage and humble,\n  Was also one with the Creator.”\n\nBrowning’s poetry is instinct with the essence of Christianity--\nthe LIFE of Christ.  There is no other poetry, there is no writing\nof any form, in this age, which so emphasizes the fact\n(and it’s the most consoling of all facts connected with\nthe Christian religion), that the Personality, Jesus Christ,\nis the impregnable fortress of Christianity.  Whatever assaults\nand inroads may be made upon the original records by\nGoettingen professors, upon the august fabric of the Church,\nwith its creeds and dogmas, and formularies, and paraphernalia,\nthis fortress will stand forever, and mankind will forever\nseek and find refuge in it.\n\nThe poem entitled ‘Cleon’ bears the intimation (there’s nothing\ndirectly expressed thereupon), that Christianity is something\ndistinct from, and beyond, whatever the highest civilization\nof the world, the civilization of Greece, attained to before Christ.\nThrough him the world obtained “a new truth--no conviction gained\nof an old one merely, made intense by a fresh appeal\nto the faded sense.”\n\nCleon, the poet, writes to Protos in his Tyranny (that is,\nin the Greek sense, Sovereignty).  Cleon must be understood\nas representing the ripe, composite result, as an individual,\nof what constituted the glory of Greece--her poetry, sculpture,\narchitecture, painting, and music, and also her philosophy.\nHe acknowledges the gifts which the King has lavished upon him.\nBy these gifts we are to understand the munificent national patronage\naccorded to the arts.  “The master of thy galley still unlades\ngift after gift; they block my court at last and pile themselves\nalong its portico royal with sunset, like a thought of thee.”\n\nBy the slave women that are among the gifts sent to Cleon,\nseems to be indicated the degradation of the spiritual by\nits subjection to earthly ideals, as were the ideals of Greek art.\nThis is more particularly indicated by the one white she-slave,\nthe lyric woman, whom further on in his letter, Cleon promises\nto the King he will make narrate (in lyric song we must suppose)\nhis fortunes, speak his great words, and describe his royal face.\n\nHe continues, that in such an act of love,--the bestowal of\nprincely gifts upon him whose song gives life its joy,--\nmen shall remark the King’s recognition of the use of life--\nthat his spirit is equal to more than merely to help on life in\nstraight ways, broad enough for vulgar souls, by ruling and the rest.\nHe ascribes to the King, in the building of his tower\n(and by this must be understood the building up of his own selfhood),\na higher motive than work for mere work’s sake,--\nthat higher motive being, the luring hope of some EVENTUAL REST\natop of it (the tower), whence, all the tumult of the building hushed,\nthe first of men may look out to the east. *\n\n --\n  * Tennyson uses a similar figure in ‘The Two Voices’.  The speaker,\n  who is meditating whether “to be or not to be”, says:--\n\n       “Were this not well, to bide mine hour,\n       Though watching from a ruined tower\n       How grows the day of human power.”\n\n  The ruined tower is his own dilapidated selfhood, whence he takes\n  his outlook upon the world.\n --\n\nBy the eventual rest atop of the tower, is indicated the aim\nof the Greek civilization, to reach a calm within the finite,\nwhile the soul is constituted and destined to gravitate forever\ntowards the infinite--to “force our straitened sphere. . .\ndisplay completely here the mastery another life should learn.”\n (‘Sordello’.)  The eventual rest in this world is not\nthe Christian ideal.  Earth-life, whatever its reach,\nand whatever its grasp, is to the Christian a broken arc,\nnot a perfect round.\n\nCleon goes on to recount his accomplishments in the arts,\nand what he has done in philosophy, in reply to the first requirement\nof Protos’s letter, Protos, as it appears, having heard of,\nand wonderingly enumerated, the great things Cleon has effected;\nand he has written to know the truth of the report.  Cleon replies,\nthat the epos on the King’s hundred plates of gold is his,\nand his the little chaunt so sure to rise from every fishing-bark when,\nlights at prow, the seamen haul their nets; that the image of\nthe sun-god on the light-house men turn from the sun’s self to see,\nis his; that the Poecile, o’erstoried its whole length with painting,\nis his, too; that he knows the true proportions of a man and woman,\nnot observed before; that he has written three books on the soul,\nproving absurd all written hitherto, and putting us to ignorance again;\nthat in music he has combined the moods, inventing one; that, in brief,\nall arts are his, and so known and recognized.  At this he writes\nthe King to marvel not.  We of these latter days, he says,\nbeing more COMPOSITE, appear not so great as our forerunners who,\nin their simple way, were greater in a certain single direction,\nthan we; but our composite way is greater.  This life of men on earth,\nthis sequence of the soul’s achievements here, he finds reason\nto believe, was intended to be viewed eventually as a great whole,\nthe individual soul being only a factor toward the realization of\nthis great whole--toward spelling out, so to speak, Zeus’s idea\nin the race.  Those divine men of old, he goes on to say,\nreached each at one point, the outside verge that rounds our faculty,\nand where they reached, who could do more than reach?\nI have not chaunted, he says, verse like Homer’s, nor swept string\nlike Terpander, nor carved and painted men like Phidias and his friend;\nI am not great as they are, point by point; but I have entered into\nsympathy with these four, running these into one soul, who, separate,\nignored each other’s arts.  The wild flower was the larger--\nI have dashed rose-blood upon its petals, pricked its cup’s honey\nwith wine, and driven its seed to fruit, and show a better flower,\nif not so large.\n\nAnd now he comes to the important questions in the King’s letter--\nwhether he, the poet, his soul thus in men’s hearts, has not attained\nthe very crown and proper end of life--whether, now life closeth up,\nhe faces death with success in his right hand,--whether he\nfears death less than he, the King, does himself, the fortunate of men,\nwho assigns the reason for thinking that he does, that he, the poet,\nleaves much behind, his life stays in the poems men shall sing,\nthe pictures men shall study; while the King’s life, complete and whole\nnow in its power and joy, dies altogether with his brain and arm,\nas HE leaves not behind, as the poet does, works of art\nembodying the essence of his life which, through those works,\nwill pass into the lives of men of all succeeding times.\nCleon replies that if in the morning of philosophy, the King,\nwith the light now in him, could have looked on all earth’s tenantry,\nfrom worm to bird, ere man appeared, and if Zeus had questioned him\nwhether he would improve on it, do more for visible creatures\nthan was done, he would have answered, “Ay, by making each\ngrow conscious in himself:  all’s perfect else, life’s mechanics\ncan no further go, and all this joy in natural life is put,\nlike fire from off thy fingers into each, so exquisitely perfect\nis the same.  But ‘tis pure fire--and they mere matter are;\nit has THEM, not they IT:  and so I choose, for man,\nthat a third thing shall stand apart from both, a quality arise\nwithin the soul, which, intro-active, made to supervise and feel\nthe force it has, may view itself and so be happy.”  But it is\nthis quality, Cleon continues, which makes man a failure.\nThis sense of sense, this spirit consciousness, grew the only life\nworth calling life, the pleasure-house, watch-tower,\nand treasure-fortress of the soul, which whole surrounding flats\nof natural life seemed only fit to yield subsistence to;\na tower that crowns a country.  But alas! the soul now climbs it\njust to perish there, for thence we have discovered that\nthere’s a world of capability for joy, spread round about us,\nmeant for us, inviting us; and still the soul craves all,\nand still the flesh replies, “Take no jot more than ere you climbed\nthe tower to look abroad!  Nay, so much less, as that fatigue\nhas brought deduction to it.”  After expatiating on this sad state\nof man, he arrives at the same conclusion as the King in his letter:\n“I agree in sum, O King, with thy profound discouragement,\nwho seest the wider but to sigh the more.  Most progress\nis most failure! thou sayest well.”\n\nAnd now he takes up the last point of the King’s letter, that he,\nthe King, holds joy not impossible to one with artist-gifts,\nwho leaves behind living works.  Looking over the sea, as he writes,\nhe says, “Yon rower with the moulded muscles there, lowering the sail,\nis nearer it that I.”  He presents with clearness, and with\nrigid logic, the DILEMMA of the growing soul; shows the vanity\nof living in works left behind, and in the memory of posterity,\nwhile he, the feeling, thinking, acting man, shall sleep in his urn.\nThe horror of the thought makes him dare imagine at times\nsome future state unlimited in capability for joy, as this is\nin DESIRE for joy.  But no! Zeus had not yet revealed such a state;\nand alas! he must have done so were it possible!\n\nHe concludes, “Live long and happy, and in that thought die,\nglad for what was!  Farewell.”  And then, as a matter\nof minor importance, he informs the King, in a postscript,\nthat he cannot tell his messenger aright where to deliver what he bears\nto one called Paulus.  Protos, it must be understood, having heard\nof the fame of Paul, and being perplexed in the extreme,\nhas written the great apostle to know of his doctrine.\nBut Cleon writes that it is vain to suppose that a mere barbarian Jew,\none circumcised, hath access to a secret which is shut from them,\nand that the King wrongs their philosophy in stooping to inquire\nof such an one.  “Oh, he finds adherents, who does not.\nCertain slaves who touched on this same isle, preached him and Christ,\nand, as he gathered from a bystander, their doctrines could be held\nby no sane man.”\n\nThere is a quiet beauty about this poem which must insinuate itself\ninto the feelings of every reader.  In tone it resembles\nthe ‘Epistle of Karshish, the Arab Physician’.  The verse\nof both poems is very beautiful.  No one can read these two poems,\nand ‘Bishop Blougram’s Apology’, and ‘The Bishop orders his Tomb\nat St. Praxed’s Church’, and not admit that Browning is a master\nof blank verse in its most difficult form--a form far more difficult\nthan that of the epic blank verse of Milton, or the Idyllic blank verse\nof Tennyson, argumentative and freighted with thought, and,\nat the same time, almost chatty, as it is, and bearing in its course\nexquisitely poetical conceptions.  The same may be said of much\nof the verse of ‘The Ring and the Book’, especially that\nof the monologues of the Canon Caponsacchi, Pompilia, the Pope,\nand Count Guido Franceschini.  But this by the way.\n\n‘Cleon’ belongs to a grand group of poems, in which Browning\nshows himself to be, as I’ve said, the most essentially Christian\nof living poets--the poet who, more emphatically than any\nof his contemporaries have done, has enforced the importance,\nthe indispensableness of a new birth, the being born from above\n(a’/nwqen) as the condition not only of soul vitality and progress,\nbut also of intellectual rectitude.  In this group of poems\nare embodied the profoundest principles of education--\nprinciples which it behoves the present generation of educators\nto look well to.  The acquisition of knowledge is a good thing,\nthe sharpening of the intellect is a good thing, the cultivation\nof philosophy is a good thing; but there is something of\ninfinitely more importance than all these--it is, the rectification,\nthe adjustment, through that mysterious operation we call sympathy,\nof the unconscious personality, the hidden soul, which co-operates\nwith the active powers, with the conscious intellect, and,\nas this unconscious personality is rectified or unrectified,\ndetermines the active powers, the conscious intellect,\nfor righteousness or unrighteousness.\n\nThe attentive reader of Browning’s poetry must soon discover\nhow remarkably homogeneous it is in spirit.  There are many authors,\nand great authors too, the reading of whose collected works\ngives the impression of their having “tried their hand” at many things.\nNo such impression is derivable from the voluminous poetry of Browning.\nWide as is its range, one great and homogeneous spirit pervades\nand animates it all, from the earliest to the latest.\nNo other living poet gives so decided an assurance of having\na BURDEN to deliver.  An appropriate general title to his works\nwould be, ‘The Burden of Robert Browning to the 19th Century’.\nHis earliest poems show distinctly his ATTITUDE toward things.\nWe see in what direction the poet has set his face--\nwhat his philosophy of life is, what soul-life means with him,\nwhat regeneration means, what edification means in its deepest sense\nof building up within us the spiritual temple.  And if he had left\nthis world after writing no more than those poems of his youth,\n‘Pauline’ and ‘Paracelsus’, a very fair ‘ex-pede-Herculem’ estimate\nmight have been made of the possibilities which he has since\nso grandly realized.\n\n\n\n\nIII.  Mr. Browning’s “Obscurity”.\n\n\nIt was long the FASHION--and that fashion has not yet passed away\n--with skimming readers and perfunctory critics to charge Mr. Browning\nwith being “wilfully obscure, unconscientiously careless,\nand perversely harsh.”\n\nThere are readers and readers.  One class, constituting, perhaps,\nnot more than one-tenth of one per cent, or a thousandth part\nof the whole number, “read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest”;\nthe remaining ninety-nine and nine-tenths per cent,\nthrough a habit of loose and indiscriminate reading, are unequal to\nthe sustained concentration of mind demanded by the higher poetry,\nthe language of which is characterized by a severe economy\nof expression--a closeness of texture, resulting from\nthe elliptical energy of highly impassioned thought.\n\nReading is, perhaps, more superficial at the present day\nthan it ever was before.  There is an almost irresistible temptation\nto reverse the “multum legendum esse non multa” of Quintilian,\noverwhelmed as we are with books, magazines, and newspapers,\nwhich no man can number, and of which thousands and tens of thousands\nof minds endeavor to gobble up all they can; and yet, from want of\nall digestive and assimilating power, they are pitiably famished\nand deadened.\n\nSir John Lubbock has lately been interested in the preparation\nof a list of the best hundred books, and to that end has solicited\nthe aid of a number of prominent scholars.  Prof. Edward Dowden\nremarks thereupon, in an article on ‘The Interpretation of Literature’,\n“It would have been more profitable for us had we been advised\nhow to read any one of the hundred; for what, indeed, does it matter\nwhether we read the best books or the worst, if we lack the power or\nthe instinct or the skill by which to reach the heart of any of them?\nBooks for most readers are, as Montaigne says, ‘a languid pleasure’;\nand so they must be, unless they become living powers, with a summons\nor a challenge for our spirit, unless we embrace them or wrestle\nwith them.”\n\nTo return from this digression to the charge against Browning\nof obscurity.  And, first, it should be said that Browning has\nso much material, such a large thought and passion capital,\nthat we never find him making a little go a great way,\nby means of EXPRESSION, or rather concealing the little by means of\nrhetorical tinsel.  We can never justly demand of him what the Queen\nin ‘Hamlet’ demands of Polonius, “more matter with less art”.\nHis thought is wide-reaching and discursive, and the motions\nof his mind rapid and leaping.  The connecting links of his thought\nhave often to be supplied by an analytic reader whose mind\nis not up to the required tension to spring over the chasm.\nHe shows great faith in his reader and “leaves the mere rude\nexplicit details”, as if he thought,\n\n                    “‘tis but brother’s speech\n     We need, speech where an accent’s change gives each\n     The other’s soul.” *\n\n    --\n     * ‘Sordello’.\n    --\n\nA truly original writer like Browning, original, I mean,\nin his spiritual attitudes, is always more of less difficult\nto the uninitiated, for the reason that he demands of his reader\nnew standpoints, new habits of thought and feeling; says, virtually,\nto his reader, Metanoei^te; and until these new standpoints are taken,\nthese new habits of thought and feeling induced, the difficulty,\nwhile appearing to the reader at the outset, to be altogether objective,\nwill really be, to a great extent, subjective, that is,\nwill be in himself.\n\nGoethe, in his ‘Wahrheit und Dichtung’, says:--\n\n“Wer einem Autor Dunkelheit vorwerfen will, sollte erst sein eigenes\nInnere besuchen, ob es denn da auch recht hell ist.  In der Daemmerung\nwird eine sehr deutliche Schrift unlesbar.” *\n\n    --\n     * He who would charge an author with obscurity, should first look\n     into his own mind, to know whether it is quite clear there.\n     In the dusk a very distinct handwriting becomes illegible.\n    --\n\nAnd George Henry Lewes, in his ‘Life of Goethe’, well says:--\n\n“A masterpiece excites no sudden enthusiasm; it must be studied much\nand long, before it is fully comprehended; we must grow up to it,\nfor it will not descend to us.  Its emphasis grows with familiarity.\nWe never become disenchanted; we grow more and more awe-struck\nat its infinite wealth.  We discover no trick, for there is none\nto discover.  Homer, Shakespeare, Raphael, Beethoven, Mozart,\nnever storm the judgment; but once fairly in possession,\nthey retain it with unceasing influence.”\n\nAnd Professor Dowden, in the article from which I have just quoted,\nsays:--\n\n“Approaching a great writer in this spirit of courageous\nand affectionate fraternity, we need all our forces and all our craft\nfor the friendly encounter.  If we love ease and lethargy,\nlet us turn in good time and fly.  The interpretation of literature,\nlike the interpretation of Nature, is no mere record of facts;\nit is no catalogue of the items which make up a book--\nsuch catalogues and analyses of contents encumber our histories\nof literature with some of their dreariest pages.  The interpretation\nof literature exhibits no series of dead items, but rather the life\nand power of one mind at play upon another mind duly qualified\nto receive and manifest these.  Hence, one who would interpret\nthe work of a master must summon up all his powers, and must be alive\nat as many points as possible.  He who approaches his author\nas a whole, bearing upon life as a whole, is himself alive\nat the greatest possible number of points, will be the best\nand truest interpreter.  For he will grasp what is central,\nand at the same time will be sensitive to the value of all details,\nwhich details he will perceive not isolated, but in connection with\none another, and with the central life to which they belong\nand from which they proceed.”\n\nIn his poem entitled ‘Pacchiarotto, and how he worked in distemper’,\nMr. Browning turns upon his critics, whom he characterizes as\n“the privileged fellows, in the drabs, blues, and yellows”\n (alluding to the covers of the leading British Reviews),\nand especially upon Alfred Austin, the author of that work\nof wholesale condemnation, ‘The Poetry of the Period’, and gives them\na sound and well-deserved drubbing.  At the close of the onset\nhe says:--\n\n     “Was it ‘grammar’ wherein you would ‘coach’ me--\n     You,--pacing in even that paddock\n     Of language allotted you ad hoc,\n     With a clog at your fetlocks,--you--scorners\n     Of me free from all its four corners?\n     Was it ‘clearness of words which convey thought?’\n     Ay, if words never needed enswathe aught\n     But ignorance, impudence, envy\n     And malice--what word-swathe would then vie\n     With yours for a clearness crystalline?\n     But had you to put in one small line\n     Some thought big and bouncing--as noddle\n     Of goose, born to cackle and waddle\n     And bite at man’s heel as goose-wont is,\n     Never felt plague its puny os frontis--\n     You’d know, as you hissed, spat and sputtered,\n     Clear ‘quack-quack’ is easily uttered!”\n\nIn a letter written to Mr. W. G. Kingsland, in 1868,\nMr. Browning says:--\n\n“I can have little doubt that my writing has been in the main\ntoo hard for many I should have been pleased to communicate with;\nbut I never designedly tried to puzzle people, as some of my critics\nhave supposed.  On the other hand, I never pretended to offer\nsuch literature as should be a substitute for a cigar\nor a game at dominoes to an idle man.  So, perhaps, on the whole\nI get my deserts, and something over--not a crowd, but a few\nI value more.” *\n\n    --\n     * ‘Browning Society Papers’, III., p. 344.\n    --\n\nIt was never truer of any author than it is true of Browning,\nthat ‘Le style c’est l’homme’; and Browning’s style is an expression\nof the panther-restlessness and panther-spring of his\nimpassioned intellect.  The musing spirit of a Wordsworth\nor a Tennyson he partakes not of.\n\nMr. Richard Holt Hutton’s characterization of the poet’s style,\nas a “crowded note-book style”, is not a particularly happy one.\nIn the passage, which he cites from Sordello, to illustrate\nthe “crowded note-book style”, occurs the following parenthesis:--\n\n     “(To be by him themselves made act,\n     Not watch Sordello acting each of them.)”\n\n“What the parenthesis means,” he says, “I have not\nthe most distant notion.  Mr. Browning might as well have said,\n‘to be by him her himself herself themselves made act’, etc.,\nfor any vestige of meaning I attach to this curious mob\nof pronouns and verbs.  It is exactly like the short notes of a speech\nintended to be interpreted afterwards by one who had heard\nand understood it himself.” *\n\n    --\n     * ‘Essays Theological and Literary’.  Vol. II., 2d ed., rev.\n     and enl., p. 175.\n    --\n\nAt first glance, this parenthesis is obscure; but the obscurity\nis not due to its being “exactly like the short notes of a speech”,\netc.  It is due to what the “obscurity” of Mr. Browning’s language,\nas language, is, in nine cases out of ten, due, namely,\nto the COLLOCATION of the words, not to an excessive economy\nof words.  He often exercises a liberty in the collocation of his words\nwhich is beyond what an uninflected language like the English\nadmits of, without more or less obscurity.  There are difficult\npassages in Browning which, if translated into Latin, would present\nno difficulty at all; for in Latin, the relations of words\nare more independent of their collocation, being indicated by\ntheir inflections.\n\nThe meaning of the parenthesis is, and, independently of the context,\na second glance takes it in (the wonder is, Mr. Hutton didn’t\ntake it in),--\n\n     “To be themselves made by him {to} act,\n     Not each of them watch Sordello acting.”\n\nThere are two or three characteristics of the poet’s diction\nwhich may be noticed here:--\n\n\n1.  The suppression of the relative, both nominative and accusative\nor dative, is not uncommon; and, until the reader becomes familiar\nwith it, it often gives, especially if the suppression is that\nof a subject relative, a momentary, but only a momentary,\ncheck to the understanding of a passage.\n\nThe following examples are from ‘The Ring and the Book’:--\n\n     “Checking the song of praise in me, had else\n     Swelled to the full for God’s will done on earth.”\n                I.  The Ring and the Book, v. 591.\n\ni.e., which had (would have) else swelled to the full, etc.\n\n     “This that I mixed with truth, motions of mine\n     That quickened, made the inertness malleolable\n     O’ the gold was not mine,”--\n               I.  The Ring and the Book, v. 703.\n\n     “Harbouring in the centre of its sense\n     A hidden germ of failure, shy but sure,\n     Should neutralize that honesty and leave\n     That feel for truth at fault, as the way is too.”\n                I.  The Ring and the Book, v. 851.\n\n     “Elaborate display of pipe and wheel\n     Framed to unchoak, pump up and pour apace\n     Truth in a flowery foam shall wash the world.”\n                I.  The Ring and the Book, v. 1113.\n\n                              “see in such\n     A star shall climb apace and culminate,”\n                III.  The Other Half Rome, v. 846.\n\n          “Guido, by his folly, forced from them\n     The untoward avowal of the trick o’ the birth,\n     Would otherwise be safe and secret now.”\n                IV.  Tertium Quid, v. 1599.\n\n                              “so I\n     Lay, and let come the proper throe would thrill\n     Into the ecstasy and outthrob pain.”\n                VI.  Giuseppe Caponsacchi, v. 972.\n\n                         “blind?\n     Ay, as a man would be inside the sun,\n     Delirious with the plentitude of light\n     Should interfuse him to the finger-ends”--\n               X.  The Pope, 1564.\n\n     “You have the sunrise now, joins truth to truth.”\n                X.  The Pope, 1763.\n\n     “One makes fools look foolisher fifty-fold\n     By putting in their place the wise like you,\n     To take the full force of an argument\n     Would buffet their stolidity in vain.”\n                XI.  Guido, 858.\n\nHere the infinitive “To take” might be understood, at first look,\nas the subject of “Would buffet”; but it depends on “putting”, etc.,\nand the subject relative “that” is suppressed:  “an argument {that}\nwould buffet their stolidity in vain.”\n\n     “Will you hear truth can do no harm nor good?”\n                XI.  Guido, 1915.\n\n     “I who, with outlet for escape to heaven,\n     Would tarry if such flight allowed my foe\n     To raise his head, relieved of that firm foot\n     Had pinned him to the fiery pavement else!”\n                XI.  Guido, 2099.\n\ni.e., “that firm foot {that} had (would have) pinned.”\n\n                    . . .\"ponder, ere ye pass,\n     Each incident of this strange human play\n     Privily acted on a theatre,\n     Was deemed secure from every gaze but God’s,”--\n               XII.  The Book and the Ring, v. 546.\n\n     “As ye become spectators of this scene--\n          *    *    *    *    *\n   --A soul made weak by its pathetic want\n     Of just the first apprenticeship to sin,\n     Would thenceforth make the sinning soul secure\n     From all foes save itself, that’s truliest foe,”--\n               XII.  The Book and the Ring, v. 559.\n\ni.e., “sin, {that} would.”\n\n     “Was he proud,--a true scion of the stock\n     Which bore the blazon, shall make bright my page”--\n               XII.  The Book and the Ring, v. 821.\n\n\n2.  The use of the infinitive without the prepositive “to”,\nis frequently extended beyond present usage, especially in ‘Sordello’\nand ‘The Ring and the Book’.  The following are examples:--\n\n     “Who fails, through deeds howe’er diverse, RE-TRACK\n     My purpose still, my task?”\n                Sordello, p. 168.\n\n          “failed Adelaide SEE then\n     Who was the natural chief, the man of men?”\n                Sordello, p. 175.\n\n               “but when\n     ‘Twas time expostulate, attempt withdraw\n     Taurello from his child,” . . .\n               Sordello, p. 180.\n\nHere are two infinitives, with the prepositive omitted,\n“expostulate” and “attempt”, both dependent on the noun “time”,\nand another, “withdraw”, without the prepositive, dependent on\n“attempt”:  “but when ‘twas time {to} expostulate, {to} attempt\n{to} withdraw”, etc.\n\n     “For thus he ventured, to the verge,\n     Push a vain mummery.” . . .\n               Sordello, p. 190.\n\ni.e., for thus he ventured {to} push to the verge a vain mummery.\n\n                         “as yet\n     He had inconsciously contrived FORGET\n     I’ the whole, to dwell o’ the points”. . .\n               Sordello, p. 190.\n\n     “Grown bestial, dreaming how BECOME divine.”\n                Sordello, p. 191.\n\n     “And the whole music it was framed AFFORD,”--\n               Sordello, p. 203.\n\n     “Was such a lighting-up of faith, in life,\n     Only allowed initiate, set man’s step\n     In the true way by help of the great glow?”\n                R. and B.  X.  The Pope, v. 1815.\n\ni.e. only allowed {to} initiate, {to} set man’s step, etc.\n\n     “If I might read instead of print my speech,--\n     Ay, and enliven speech with many a flower\n     Refuses obstinately blow in print.”\n                R. and B.  IX.  Johannes-Baptista Bottinius, v. 4.\n\nHere the subject relative of “refuses” is omitted, and the verb\nfollowed by an infinitive without the prepositive:\n“many a flower {that} refuses obstinately {to} blow in print.”\n\n\n3.  Instead of the modern analytic form, the simple form\nof the past subjunctive derived from the Anglo-Saxon inflectional form,\nand identical with that of the past indicative, is frequently employed,\nthe context only showing that it is the subjunctive.  (See Abbott’s\n‘Shakespearian Grammar’, 361 et seq.)\n\n     “Would we some prize might hold\n     To match those manifold\n     Possessions of the brute,--gain most, as we did best!”\n                Rabbi Ben Ezra, St. xi.\n\ni.e., as we should do best.\n\n     “Thus were abolished Spring and Autumn both,”\n                I.  The Ring and the Book, 1358.\n\ni.e., would be abolished.\n\n     “His peevishness had promptly put aside\n     Such honor and refused the proffered boon,” . . .\n               II.  Half Rome (R. and B.), 369.\n\ni.e., would have promptly put aside.\n\n     “(What daily pittance pleased the plunderer dole.)”\n                X.  The Pope (R. and B.), 561.\n\ni.e., as the context shows, {it} might please the plunderer {to} dole.\n\n               “succession to the inheritance\n     Which bolder crime had lost you:”\n                IV.  Tertium Quid (R. and B.), 1104.\n\ni.e., would have lost you.\n\nBut the verbs “be” and “have” are chiefly so used, and not often\nbeyond what present usage allows. *\n\n  --\n   * Tennyson uses “saw” = ‘viderem’, in the following passage:--\n\n        “But since I did not see the Holy Thing,\n        I sware a vow to follow it till I saw.”\n                   Sir Percivale in ‘The Holy Grail’.\n  --\n\n\n4.  The use of the dative, or indirect object, without “to” or “for”.\n\nSuch datives are very frequent, and scarcely need illustration.\nThe poet has simply carried the use of them beyond the present\ngeneral usage of the language.  But there’s a noticeable one\nin the Pope’s Monologue, in ‘The Ring and the Book’, vv. 1464-1466:\nThe Archbishop of Arezzo, to whom poor Pompilia has applied,\nin her distress, for protection against her brutal husband,\nthinks it politic not to take her part, but send her back to him\nand enjoin obedience and submission.  The Pope, in his Monologue,\nrepresents the crafty Archbishop as saying, when Pompilia cries,\n“Protect me from the wolf!”\n\n     “No, thy Guido is rough, heady, strong,\n     Dangerous to disquiet:  let him bide!\n     He needs some bone to mumble, help amuse\n     The darkness of his den with:  so, the fawn\n     Which limps up bleeding to my foot and lies,\n   --Come to me daughter!--thus I throw him back!”\n\ni.e., thus I throw back {to} him the fawn which limps up bleeding\nto my foot and lies.  The parenthesis, “Come to me, daughter”,\nbeing interposed, and which is introduced as preparatory\nto his purpose, adds to the difficulty of the construction.\n\nThere are, after all, but comparatively few instances\nin Browning’s poetry, where these features of his diction\ncan be fairly condemned.  They often impart a crispness\nto the expressions in which they occur.\n\nThe contriving spirit of the poet’s language often results\nin great complexity of construction.  Complexity of construction\nmay be a fault, and it may not.  It may be justified by the complexity\nof the thought which it bears along.  “Clear quack-quack\nis easily uttered.”  But where an author’s thought is nimble,\nfar-reaching, elliptical through its energy, and discursive,\nthe expression of it must be more or less complex or involved;\nhe will employ subordinate clauses, and parentheses, through which\nto express the outstanding, restricting, and toning relations\nof his thought, that is, if he is a master of perspective,\nand ranks his grouped thoughts according to their relative importance.\n\nThe poet’s apostrophe to his wife in the spirit-world, which closes\nthe long prologue to ‘The Ring and the Book’ (vv. 1391-1416),\nand in which he invokes her aid and benediction, in the work\nhe has undertaken, presents a greater complexity of construction\nthan is to be met with anywhere else in his works; and of this passage\nit may be said, as it may be said of any other having\na complex construction, supposing this to be the only difficulty,\nthat it’s hard rather than obscure, and demands close reading.  But,\nnotwithstanding its complex structure and the freight of thought\nconveyed, the passage has a remarkable LIGHTSOMENESS of movement,\nand is a fine specimen of blank verse.  The unobtrusive,\nbut distinctly felt, alliteration which runs through it,\ncontributes something toward this lightsomeness.  The first two verses\nhave a Tennysonian ring:--\n\n\n        “O lyric Love, half-angel and half-bird\n        And all a wonder and a wild desire,--\n        Boldest of hearts that ever braved the sun,\n        Took sanctuary within the holier blue,\n    5   And sang a kindred soul out to his face,--\n        Yet human at the red-ripe of the heart--\n        When the first summons from the darkling earth\n        Reached thee amid thy chambers, blanched their blue,\n        And bared them of the glory--to drop down,\n   10   To toil for man, to suffer or to die,--\n        This is the same voice:  can thy soul know change?\n        Hail then, and hearken from the realms of help!\n        Never may I commence my song, my due\n        To God who best taught song by gift of thee,\n   15   Except with bent head and beseeching hand--\n        That still, despite the distance and the dark,\n        What was, again may be; some interchange\n        Of grace, some splendour once thy very thought,\n        Some benediction anciently thy smile:\n   20 --Never conclude, but raising hand and head\n        Thither where eyes, that cannot reach, yet yearn\n        For all hope, all sustainment, all reward,\n        Their utmost up and on,--so blessing back\n        In those thy realms of help, that heaven thy home,\n   25   Some whiteness which, I judge, thy face makes proud,\n        Some wanness where, I think, thy foot may fall!” *\n\n    --\n     * In the last three verses of ‘The Ring and the Book’\n     the poet again addresses his “Lyric Love” to express the wish\n     that the Ring, which he has rounded out of the rough ore\n     of the Roman murder case, might but lie “in guardianship”\n      outside hers,\n\n          “Thy rare gold ring of verse (the poet praised)\n          Linking our England to his Italy.”\n\n     The reference is to the inscription on Casa Guidi,\n     Via Maggiore, 9.

J. Furnivall,\nread at the forty-eighth meeting of the Browning Society, February 25,\n1887, being No. 39 of the Society’s Papers.\n\nBut, after all, the difficulties in Browning which result from\nthe construction of the language, be that what it may,\nare not the main difficulties, as has been too generally supposed.\nTHE MAIN DIFFICULTIES ARE QUITE INDEPENDENT OF THE CONSTRUCTION\nOF THE LANGUAGE.\n\nMany readers, especially those who take an intellectual attitude\ntoward all things, in the heavens above and in the earth beneath,\nsuppose that they are prepared to understand almost anything\nwhich is understandable if it is only PUT right.  This is a most\negregious mistake, especially in respect to the subtle and complex\nspiritual experiences which the more deeply subjective poetry embodies.\nWhat De Quincey says in his paper on Kant,* of the comprehension of\nthe higher philosophical truths, can, with still better reason,\nbe said of the responsiveness to the higher spiritual truths:\n“No complex or very important truth was ever yet transferred\nin full development from one mind to another:  truth of that character\nis not a piece of furniture to be shifted; it is a seed which must be sown,\nand pass through the several stages of growth.  No doctrine of importance\ncan be transferred in a matured shape into any man’s understanding\nfrom without:  it must arise by an act of genesis within\nthe understanding itself.”\n\n    --\n     * ‘Letters to a Young Man’.  Letter V.\n    --\n\nAnd so it may be said in regard to the responsiveness to\nthe higher spiritual truths--I don’t say COMPREHENSION of\nthe higher spiritual truths (that word pertains rather to\nan intellectual grasp), but RESPONSIVENESS to the higher\nspiritual truths.  Spiritual truths must be spiritually responded to;\nthey are not and cannot be intellectually comprehended.  The condition\nof such responsiveness it may require a long while to fulfil.\nNew attitudes of the soul, a meta/noia, may be demanded,\nbefore such responsiveness is possible.  And what some people\nmay regard in the higher poetry as obscure, by reason of the mode\nof its presentation on the part of the poet, may be only relatively so\n--that is, the obscurity may be wholly due to the wrong attitudes,\nor the no attitudes, of their own souls, and to the limitations of\ntheir spiritual experiences.  In that case “the patient must minister\nto himself”.\n\nWhile on the subject of “obscurity”, I must notice a difficulty\nwhich the reader at first experiences in his study of Browning’s poetry\n--a difficulty resulting from the poet’s favorite art-form,\nthe dramatic or psychologic monologue.*  The largest portion\nof his voluminous poetry is in this form.  Some speaker is made\nto reveal his character, and, sometimes, by reflection, or directly,\nthe character of some one else--to set forth some subtle\nand complex soul-mood, some supreme, all-determining movement or experience\nof a life; or, it may be, to RATIOCINATE subtly on some curious question\nof theology, morals, philosophy, or art.  Now it is in strictly preserving\nthe monologue character that obscurity often results.  A monologue\noften begins with a startling abruptness, and the reader must\nread along some distance before he gathers what the beginning means.\nTake the monologue of Fra Lippo Lippi for example.  The situation\nis necessarily left more or less unexplained.  The poet says nothing\n‘in propria persona’, and no reply is made to the speaker\nby the person or persons addressed.  Sometimes a look, a gesture,\nor a remark, must be supposed on the part of the one addressed,\nwhich occasions a responsive remark.  Sometimes the speaker IMPUTES\na question; and the reader is sometimes obliged to stop and consider\nwhether a question is imputed by the speaker to the one\nhe is addressing, or is a direct question of his own.  This is often\nthe case throughout ‘The Ring and the Book’.  But to the initiated,\nthese features of the monologue present little or no difficulty,\nand they conduce to great compactness of composition--\na closeness of texture which the reader comes in time to enjoy,\nand to prefer to a more loosely woven diction.\n\n--\n * The dramatic monologue differs from a soliloquy in this:\n while there is but one speaker, the presence of a silent second person\n is supposed, to whom the arguments of the speaker are addressed.\n Perhaps such a situation may be termed a novelty of invention\n in our Poet.  It is obvious that the dramatic monologue gains over\n the soliloquy in that it allows the artist greater room in which\n to work out his conception of character.  We cannot gaze long\n at a solitary figure on a canvas, however powerfully treated,\n without feeling some need of relief.  In the same way a soliloquy\n (comp. the great soliloquies of Shakespeare) cannot be protracted\n to any great length without wearying the listener.  The thoughts\n of a man in self-communion are apt to run in a certain circle,\n and to assume a monotony.  The introduction of a second person\n acting powerfully upon the speaker throughout, draws the latter forth\n into a more complete and varied expression of his mind.\n The silent person in the background, who may be all the time\n master of the situation, supplies a powerful stimulus\n to the imagination of the reader.--Rev. Prof. E. Johnson’s\n “Paper on ‘Bishop Blougram’s Apology’” (‘Browning Soc. Papers’,\n Pt. III., p. 279).\n--\n\nThe monologue entitled ‘My Last Duchess.  Ferrara’ is a good example\nof the constitution of this art-form.  It is one of the most perfect\nin artistic treatment, and exhibits all the features I have just noticed.\nOriginally, this monologue and that now entitled ‘Count Gismond.\nAix in Provence’, had the common title, ‘Italy and France’,\nthe former being No. I. Italy; the latter, No. II. France.  The poet,\nno doubt, afterward thought that the Duke of the one monologue,\nand the Count of the other, could not justly be presented\nas representatives, respectively, of Italy and France.\nIn giving the monologues new titles, ‘My Last Duchess’ and ‘Count Gismond’,\nhe added to the one, ‘Ferrara’, and to the other, ‘Aix in Provence’,\nthus locally restricting the order of character which\nthey severally represent.\n\nIn ‘My Last Duchess’, the speaker is a soulless VIRTUOSO--\na natural product of a proud, arrogant, and exclusive aristocracy,\non the one hand, and on the other, of an old and effete city,\nlike Ferrara, where art, rather than ministering to soul-life\nand true manliness of character, has become an end to itself--\nis valued for its own sake.\n\nThe Duke is showing, with the weak pride of the mere virtuoso,\na portrait of his last Duchess, to some one who has been sent\nto negotiate another marriage.  We see that he is having\nan entertainment or reception of some kind in his palace,\nand that he has withdrawn from the company with the envoy\nto the picture-gallery on an upper floor.  He has pulled aside\nthe curtain from before the portrait, and in remarking on\nthe expression which the artist, Fra Pandolf,\nhas given to the face, he is made to reveal a fiendish jealousy\non his part, occasioned by the sweetness and joyousness of\nhis late Duchess, who, he thought, should show interest in nothing\nbut his own fossilized self.  “She had,” he says, “a heart--\nhow shall I say?--too soon made glad, too easily impressed;\nshe liked whate’er she looked on, and her looks went everywhere.\nSir, ‘twas all one!  My favour at her breast, the dropping of\nthe daylight in the West, the bough of cherries some officious fool\nbroke in the orchard for her, the white mule she rode with\nround the terrace--all and each would draw from her alike\nthe approving speech, or blush, at least.  She thanked men,--good!\nbut thanked somehow--I know not how--as if she ranked my gift\nof a nine-hundred-years-old name with anybody’s gift.”\n\nHer fresh interest in things, and the sweet smile she had for all,\ndue to a generous soul-life, proved fatal to the lovely Duchess:\n“Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt, whene’er I passed her; but who passed\nwithout much the same smile?  This grew; I gave commands;\nthen all smiles stopped together.”\n\nHe succeeded, and he seems to be proud of it, in shutting off\nall her life-currents, pure, and fresh, and sparkling, as they were,\nand we must suppose that she than sank slowly and uncomplainingly away.\nWhat a deep pathos there is in “then all smiles stopped together”! *\n\n    --\n     * “I gave commands” certainly must not be understood to mean\n     commands for her death, as it is understood by the writer of the\n     articles in ‘The Saint Paul’s Magazine’ for December, 1870, and\n     January, 1871. {See Preface:  Note to the Third Edition.}\n    --\n\nThe contemptible meanness and selfishness of jealousy\nwere never exhibited with greater power, than they are exhibited in\nthis short monologue--a power largely due to the artistic treatment.\nThe jealousy of Leontes, in ‘The Winter’s Tale’, of Shakespeare,\nis nobility itself, in comparison with the Duke’s.  How distinctly,\nwhile indirectly, the sweet Duchess is, with a few masterly touches,\nplaced before us!  The poet shows his artistic skill especially\nin his indirect, reflected portraitures.\n\nThis short composition, comprising as it does but fifty-six lines,\nis, of itself, sufficient to prove the poet a consummate artist.\nTennyson’s TECHNIQUE is quite perfect, almost “faultily faultless”,\nindeed; but in no one of his compositions has he shown an equal degree\nof art-power, in the highest sense of the word.\n\n\n  {‘My Last Duchess’}\n\n  “That’s my last Duchess painted on the wall,\n  Looking as if she were alive.  I call\n  That piece a wonder, now:  Fra Pandolf’s hands\n  Worked busily a day, and there she stands.\n  Will’t please you sit and look at her?  I said,\n  ‘Fra Pandolf’ by design:  for never read\n  Strangers like you that pictured countenance,\n  The depth and passion of its earnest glance,\n  But to myself they turned (since none puts by\n  The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)\n  And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,\n  How such a glance came there; so, not the first\n  Are you to turn and ask thus.  Sir, ‘twas not\n  Her husband’s presence only, called that spot\n  Of joy into the Duchess’ cheek:  perhaps\n  Fra Pandolf chanced to say ‘Her mantle laps\n  Over my lady’s wrist too much’, or ‘Paint\n  Must never hope to reproduce the faint\n  Half-flush that dies along her throat’:  such stuff\n  Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough\n  For calling up that spot of joy.  She had\n  A heart--how shall I say?--too soon made glad,\n  Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er\n  She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.\n  Sir, ‘twas all one!  My favour at her breast,\n  The dropping of the daylight in the West,\n  The bough of cherries some officious fool\n  Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule\n  She rode with round the terrace--all and each\n  Would draw from her alike the approving speech,\n  Or blush, at least.  She thanked men,--good! but thanked\n  Somehow--I know not how--as if she ranked\n  My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name\n  With anybody’s gift.  Who’d stoop to blame\n  This sort of trifling?  Even had you skill\n  In speech--(which I have not)--to make your will\n  Quite clear to such an one, and say, ‘Just this\n  Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,\n  Or there exceed the mark’--and if she let\n  Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set\n  Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,\n--E’en then would be some stooping; and I choose\n  Never to stoop.  Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt,\n  Whene’er I passed her; but who passed without\n  Much the same smile?  This grew; I gave commands;\n  Then all smiles stopped together.  There she stands\n  As if alive.  Will’t please you rise?  We’ll meet\n  The company below, then.  I repeat,\n  The Count your master’s known munificence\n  Is ample warrant that no just pretence\n  Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;\n  Though his fair daughter’s self, as I avowed\n  At starting, is my object.  Nay, we’ll go\n  Together down, sir.  Notice Neptune, though,\n  Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,\n  Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me! *\n\n    --\n     * Claus of Innsbruck and also Fra Pandolf (v. 3) are imaginary\n     artists.\n    --\n\n\nThe last ten verses illustrate well the poet’s skilful management\nof his difficult art-form.  After the envoy has had his look\nat the portrait, the Duke, thinking it time to return to his guests,\nsays “Will’t please you rise?  We’ll meet the company below, then.”\n His next speech, which indicates what he has been talking about,\nduring the envoy’s study of the picture, must be understood\nas uttered while they are moving toward the stairway.  The next,\n“Nay, we’ll go together down, sir”, shows that they have reached\nthe head of the stairway, and that the envoy has politely motioned\nthe Duke to lead the way down.  This is implied in the “Nay”.\nThe last speech indicates that on the stairway is a window\nwhich affords an outlook into the courtyard, where he calls\nthe attention of the envoy to a Neptune, taming a sea-horse,\ncast in bronze for him by Claus of Innsbruck.  The pride\nof the virtuoso is also implied in the word, “though”.\n\nIt should be noticed, also, that the Duke values his wife’s picture\nwholly as a picture, not as the “counterfeit presentment” and reminder\nof a sweet and lovely woman, who might have blessed his life,\nif he had been capable of being blessed.  It is to him a picture\nby a great artist, and he values it only as such.  He says,\nparenthetically, “since none puts by the curtain I have drawn for you,\nbut I.”  It’s too precious a work of art to be entrusted to anybody else.\n\n\n\n\nIV.  Browning’s Verse.\n\n\n\nIt seems to be admitted, even by many of the poet’s\nmost devoted students, that his verse is, in its general character,\nharsh and rugged.  To judge it fairly, one must free his mind\nof many merely conventional canons in regard to verse.\nPure music is absolute.  The music of verse moves, or should move,\nunder the conditions of the thought which articulates it.  It should\nserve as a chorus to the thought, expressing a mystic sympathy\nwith it.  Verse may be very musical, and yet more or less mechanical;\nthat is, it may CLOTHE thought and sentiment, but not be a part\nof it, not EMBODY it.  Unrippled verse, which many readers demand,\nMUST be more or less mechanical.  Such verse flows according to\nits own sweet will, independently of the thought-articulation.\nBut the thought-articulation may be so flimsy that it’s well enough\nfor the verse so to flow.\n\nThe careful student of Browning’s language-shaping must discover--\nthe requisite susceptibility to vitality of form being supposed--\nthat his verse is remarkably organic:  often, indeed, more organic,\neven when it appears to be clumsy, than the “faultily faultless” verse\nof Tennyson.  The poet who has written ‘In a Gondola’,\n‘By the Fireside’, ‘Meeting at Night’, ‘Parting at Morning’,\n‘Gold Hair’, ‘May and Death’, ‘Love among the Ruins’,\n‘Home Thoughts from Abroad’, ‘Home Thoughts from the Sea’,\nthe Incantation in ‘The Flight of the Duchess’ (some of which are both\nsong and picture), and many, many more that might be named,\ncertainly has the very highest faculty of word and verse music,\nof music, too, that is entirely new in English Poetry;\nand it can be shown that he always exercises that faculty\nWHENEVER THERE’S A REAL ARTISTIC OCCASION FOR IT, not otherwise.\nVerse-music is never with him a mere literary indulgence.\nThe grotesquerie of rhythm and rhyme which some of his poems exhibit,\nis as organic as any other feature of his language-shaping,\nand shows the rarest command of language.  He has been charged with\nhaving “failed to reach continuous levels of musical phrasing”.\nIt’s a charge which every one who appreciates Browning’s verse\nin its higher forms (and its higher forms are not those which are\naddressed especially to the physical ear) will be very ready to admit.\nIn the general tenor of his poetry, he is ABOVE the Singer,--\nhe is the Seer and Revealer, who sees great truths beyond the bounds\nof the territory of general knowledge, instead of working over truths\nwithin that territory; and no seer of modern times has had his eyes\nmore clearly purged with euphrasy and rue.  Poetry is with him,\nin the language of Mr. E. Paxton Hood (‘Eclectic and Congregational Rev.’,\nDec., 1868), “no jingle of words, or pretty amusement\nfor harpsichord or piano, but rather a divine trigonometry,\na process of celestial triangulation, a taking observations of\ncelestial places and spheres, an attempt to estimate our world,\nits place, its life amidst the boundless immeasurable sweeps\nof space and time; or if describing, then describing\nthe animating stories of the giants, how they fought and fell,\nor conquered. . .a great all-inclusive strength of song,\nwhich is as a battle march to warriors, or as the refreshment\nof brooks and dates to the spent and toiling soldiers on their way,\nis more than the pretty idyll, whose sweet and plaintive story\npleases the idle hour or idle ear.”\n\nThe Rev. Prof. E. Johnson, in the section entitled ‘Poets of the Ear\nand of the Eye’, of his valuable paper on ‘Conscience and Art\nin Browning’ (‘Browning Soc. Papers’, Part III., pp. 345-380),\nhas ably shown that “the economy of music is a necessity\nof Browning’s Art”--that music, instead of ever being an end\nto itself, is with him a means to a much higher end.  He says:--\n\n\n“All poetry may be classified according to its form or its contents.\nFormal classification is easy, but of little use.  When we have\ndistinguished compositions as dramatic, lyrical, or characterized\na poet in like manner, we have done little.  What we want to ascertain\nis the peculiar quality of the imaginative stuff with which\nhe plastically works, and to appreciate its worth.  This is always\na great task, but one particularly necessary in the case of Browning,\nbecause the stuff in which he has wrought is so novel\nin the poet’s hands.  Psychology itself is comparatively a new\nand modern study, as a distinct science; but a psychological poet,\nwho has made it his business to clothe psychic abstractions\n‘in sights and sounds’, is entirely a novel appearance in literature.\n\n“Now that phrase ‘clothing in sights and sounds’ may yield us the clue\nto the classification we are seeking.  The function of artists,\nthat is, musicians, poets in the narrower sense, and painters,\nis to clothe Truth in sights and sounds for the hearing and seeing\nof us all.  Their call to do this lies in their finer and fuller\naesthetic faculty.  The sense of hearing and that of seeing\nstand in polar opposition, and thus a natural scale offers itself\nby which we may rank and arrange our artists.  At the one end\nof the scale is the acoustic artist, i.e., the musician.  At the other\nend of the scale is the optic artist, the painter and sculptor.\nBetween these, and comprising both these activities in his own,\nis the poet, who is both acoustic and optic artist.  He translates\nthe sounds of the world, both external and internal,--\nthe tumult of storms, the murmurs of waves, the SUSURRUS of\nthe woodland, the tinkling of brooks, the throbbing of human hearts,\nthe cries of all living creatures; all those groans of pain,\nstammers of desire, shrieks of despair, yawns even of languor,\nwhich are ever breaking out of the heart of things; and beside\nall this, the hearsay, commonplace, proverbial lore of the world.\nHe turns these into melodies which shall be caught up by those\nwho listen.  In short, he converts by his alchemy the common stuff\nof pain and of joy into music.  But he is optic as well as acoustic;\nthat is, he calls up at the same time by his art a procession of images\nwhich march or dance across the theatre of the listener’s fancy.\nNow the question of classification on this scheme comes to this,\nDoes the particular poet who invites our attention deal more\nwith the aesthesis of the ear or with that of the eye?  Does he more\nfill our ear with sweet tunes or our fancy with shapes and colours?\nDoes he compel us to listen and shut our eyes, or to open our eyes wide\nand dispense with all but the faintest musical accompaniment?\nWhat sense, in short, does he mainly address himself to?\nGoethe said that he was a ‘seeing’ man; W. von Humboldt,\nthe great linguist, that he was a ‘listening’ man.  The influence\nof Milton’s blindness on his poetry was noticed by Lessing.\nThe short-sightedness of Wieland has also been detected in his poetry.\n\n“If we apply these tests to Browning, there can be, I think,\nno doubt as to the answer.  He is, in common with all poets,\nboth musician and painter, but much more the latter than the former.\nHe is never for a moment the slave of his ear, if I may so express it.\nWe know that he has, on the contrary, the mastery of music.\nBut music helps and supports his imagination, never controls it.\nMusic is to Browning an inarticulate revelation of the truth\nof the supersensual world, the ‘earnest of a heaven’.\nHe is no voluptuary in music.  Music is simply the means\nby which the soul wings its way into the azure of spiritual theory\nand contemplation.  Take only ‘Saul’ and ‘Abt Vogler’ in illustration.\n‘Saul’ is a magnificent interpretation of the old theme,\na favorite with the mystics, that evil spirits are driven out by music.\nBut in this interpretation it is not the mere tones, the thrumming\non the harp, it is the religious movement of the intelligence,\nit is the truth of Divine love throbbing in every chord,\nwhich constitutes the spell.  And so in ‘Abt Vogler’;\nthe abbot’s instrument is only the means whereby he strikes out\nthe light of faith and hope within him.  Not to dwell upon this point,\nI would only say that it seems clear that Browning has the finest\nacoustic gifts, and could, if he had chosen, have scattered\nmusical bons-bons through every page.  But he has printed\nno ‘versus inopes rerum, nugaeque canorae’ (Hor. ad Pis.).\nHe has had higher objects in view, and has dispensed better stuff\nthan that which lingers in the ear, and tends to suppress\nrather than support the higher activity of thought.\n\n“When for a moment he shuts his eyes, and falls purely into\nthe listening or ‘musing’ mood, he becomes the instrument of\na rich deep music, breaking out of the heart of the unseen world,\nas in the Dirge of unfaithful Poets in ‘Paracelsus’,\nor the Gypsy’s Incantation in the ‘Flight of the Duchess’,\nor the Meditation at the crisis of Sordello’s temptation.\n\n“When the keen inquisitive intelligence is in its full waking activity\nthere grows ‘more of the words’ and thought, and ‘less of the music’,\nto invert a phrase of the poet’s.  The melody ceases,\nthe rhythm is broken, as in all intense, earnest conversation.\nAt times only the tinkle of the pairing rhymes, of which Browning\nhas made a most witty use, reminds that we are called to partake\na mood in which commonplace associations are melting into the ideal.\nI believe the economy of music is a necessity of Browning’s art;\nand it would be only fair, if those who attack him on this ground\nwould consider how far thought of such quality as his admits of\nbeing chanted, or otherwise musically accompanied.  In plain words\nthe problem is, how far the pleasures of sound and of sense\ncan be united in poetry; and it will be found in every case\nthat a poet sacrifices something either to the one or to the other.\nBrowning has said something in his arch way on this point.  In effect,\nhe remarks, Italian prose can render a simple thought more sweetly\nto the ear than either Greek or English verse.  It seems clear\nfrom many other of his critical remarks that he considers the demand\nfor music in preference to thought in poetry, as the symptom\nof a false taste.\n\n“Browning’s poetry is to be gazed at, rather than listened to\nand recited, for the most part.  It is infinitely easier to listen\nfor an hour to spiritual music than to fix one’s whole attention\nfor a few minutes on a spiritual picture.  In the latter act of mind\nwe find a rich musical accompaniment distracting, while a slight\nmusical accompaniment is probably helpful.  And perhaps\nwe may characterize Browning’s poetry as a series of spiritual pictures\nwith a faint musical accompaniment.\n\n“For illustration by extreme contrast, Milton may be compared\nwith Browning.  Milton was a great hearsay poet, Browning repeats\nno hearsay.  In reading Milton, the difficulty is to keep up\nthe mental tension where there is so little thought, strictly speaking.\nWith Browning the highest tension is exacted.\n\n“He is pre-eminently the looker, the seer, the ‘maker-see’;\nthe reporter, the painter of the scenery and events of the soul.\nAnd if the sense of vision is our noblest, and we instinctively\nexpress the acts of intelligence in terms drawn from physical vision,\nthe poet who leans most towards the ‘SEER of Power and Love\nin the absolute, Beauty and Goodness in the concrete’,\ntakes the higher rank.  This is no matter for bigotry of taste.\nSingers and seers, musicians and reporters, and reproducers\nof every degree, who have something to tell us or to show us\nof the ‘world as God has made it, where all is beauty’,\nwe have need of all.  But of singers there are many,\nof seers there are few, that is all.”\n\n\nIn the most difficult form of verse, namely, blank verse,\nBrowning has shown himself a great master, and has written some\nof the very best in the literature.  And great as is the extent\nof his blank verse, the ‘Ring and the Book’ alone containing 21,116 verses,\nit never entirely lapses into prose.\n\nOne grand merit of blank verse is in the SWEEP of it; another,\nin its pause-melody, which can be secured only by a skilful recurrence\nof an unbroken measure; without this, variety of pause\nceases to be variety, and results in a metrical chaos;\na third is in its lightsomeness of movement, its go,\nwhen well-freighted with thought.  All these merits are found\nunited in much of Browning’s blank verse, especially\nin that of ‘The Ring and the Book’.  As an example of this,\ntake the following passage from the monologue of the Canon Caponsacchi.\nIt gives expression to his vision of Count Guido’s\nspiritual down-sliding; “in the lowest deep a lower deep still\nthreatening to devour him, opens wide”:--\n\n  “And thus I see him slowly and surely edged\n  Off all the table-land whence life upsprings\n  Aspiring to be immortality,\n  As the snake, hatched on hill-top by mischance,\n  Despite his wriggling, slips, slides, slidders down\n  Hill-side, lies low and prostrate on the smooth\n  Level of the outer place, lapsed in the vale:\n  So I lose Guido in the loneliness,\n  Silence, and dusk, till at the doleful end,\n  At the horizontal line, creation’s verge,\n  From what just is to absolute nothingness--\n  Lo, what is this he meets, strains onward still?\n  What other man, deep further in the fate,\n  Who, turning at the prize of a foot-fall\n  To flatter him and promise fellowship,\n  Discovers in the act a frightful face--\n  Judas, made monstrous by much solitude!\n  The two are at one now!  Let them love their love\n  That bites and claws like hate, or hate their hate\n  That mops and mows and makes as it were love!\n  There, let them each tear each in devil’s-fun,\n  Or fondle this the other while malice aches--\n  Both teach, both learn detestability!\n  Kiss him the kiss, Iscariot!  Pay that back,\n  That smatch o’ the slaver blistering on your lip--\n  By the better trick, the insult he spared Christ--\n  Lure him the lure o’ the letters, Aretine!\n  Lick him o’er slimy-smooth with jelly-filth\n  O’ the verse-and-prose pollution in love’s guise!\n  The cockatrice is with the basilisk!\n  There let him grapple, denizens o’ the dark,\n  Foes or friends, but indissolubly bound,\n  In their one spot out of the ken of God\n  Or care of man for ever and ever more!”\n\nBrowning has distinctly indicated the standard by which\nhe estimates art-work, in the closing paragraph of his Essay\n‘On the Poet objective and subjective; on the latter’s aim;\non Shelley as man and poet’.\n\n“I would rather,” he says, “consider Shelley’s poetry as a sublime\nfragmentary essay towards a presentment of the correspondency\nof the universe to Deity, of the natural to the spiritual,\nand of the actual to the ideal, than I would isolate\nand separately appraise the worth of many detachable portions\nwhich might be acknowledged AS UTTERLY PERFECT IN A LOWER\nMORAL POINT OF VIEW, UNDER THE MERE CONDITIONS OF ART.\nIt would be easy to take my stand on successful instances\nof objectivity in Shelley:  there is the unrivalled ‘Cenci’; there is\nthe ‘Julian and Maddalo’ too; there is the magnificent ‘Ode to Naples’:\nwhy not regard, it may be said, the less organized matter\nas the radiant elemental foam and solution, out of which would have\nbeen evolved, eventually, creations as perfect even as those?\nBut I prefer to look for the highest attainment, not simply the high,\n--and, seeing it, I hold by it.  There is surely enough\nof the work ‘Shelley’ to be known enduringly among men, and, I believe,\nto be accepted of God, as human work may; and AROUND THE IMPERFECT\nPROPORTIONS OF SUCH, THE MOST ELABORATED PRODUCTIONS OF ORDINARY ART\nMUST ARRANGE THEMSELVES AS INFERIOR ILLUSTRATIONS.”\n\nThe italics are mine.  I would say, but without admitting\nimperfect art on the part of Browning, for I regard him as one\nof the greatest of literary artists, that HE must be estimated by\nthe standard presented in this passage, by the “presentment”,\neverywhere in his poetry, “of the correspondency of the universe\nto Deity, of the natural to the spiritual, and of the actual\nto the ideal.”\n\nThe same standard is presented in ‘Andrea del Sarto’,\nin ‘Old Pictures in Florence’, and in other of his poems.\n\n\n\n\nV.  Arguments of the Poems.\n\n     * It has not been thought necessary, in these Arguments, to\n     use quotation marks wherever expressions from the poems are\n     incorporated; and especially where they are adapted in\n     construction to the place where they are introduced.\n\n\n\n\nWanting is--What?\n\n\n“Love, the soul of soul, within the soul”, the Christ-spirit,\nthe spirit of the “Comer” (o‘ e’rxo/menos, Matt. 11:3),\ncompletes incompletion, reanimates that which without it is dead,\nand admits to a fellowship with the soul of things; ‘Ubi caritas,\nibi claritas’.  See passage from ‘Fifine at the Fair’,\nquoted under ‘My Star’.\n\n\n\n\nMy Star.\n\n\nThe following passage from ‘Fifine at the Fair’, section 55,\nis an expansion of the idea involved in ‘My Star’, and is\nthe best commentary which can be given on it:--\n\n          “I search but cannot see\n  What purpose serves the soul that strives, or world it tries\n  Conclusions with, unless the fruit of victories\n  Stay, one and all, stored up and guaranteed its own\n  For ever, by some mode whereby shall be made known\n  The gain of every life.  Death reads the title clear--\n  What each soul for itself conquered from out things here:\n  Since, IN THE SEEING SOUL, ALL WORTH LIES, I ASSERT,--\n  AND NOUGHT I’ THE WORLD, WHICH, SAVE FOR SOUL THAT SEES, INERT\n  WAS, IS, AND WOULD BE EVER,--STUFF FOR TRANSMUTING--NULL\n  AND VOID UNTIL MAN’S BREATH EVOKE THE BEAUTIFUL--\n  BUT, TOUCHED ARIGHT, PROMPT YIELDS EACH PARTICLE, ITS TONGUE\n  OF ELEMENTAL FLAME,--no matter whence flame sprung\n  From gums and spice, or else from straw and rottenness,\n  So long as soul has power to make them burn, express\n  What lights and warms henceforth, leaves only ash behind,\n  Howe’er the chance:  if soul be privileged to find\n  Food so soon that, at first snatch of eye, suck of breath,\n  It shall absorb pure life:” etc.\n\n\n\n\nThe Flight of the Duchess.\n\n\n\nIn ‘The Flight of the Duchess’ we are presented with\na generous soul-life, as exhibited by the sweet, glad Duchess,\nlinked with fossil conventionalism and mediaevalsim,\nand an inherited authority which brooks no submissiveness,\nas exhibited by the Duke, her husband, “out of whose veins\nceremony and pride have driven the blood, leaving him but a fumigated\nand embalmed self”.  The scene of the poem is a “rough north land”,\nsubject to a Kaiser of Germany.  The story is so plainly told\nthat no prose summary of it could make it plainer.  Its deeper meaning\ncentres in the incantation of the old gypsy woman, in which\nis mystically shadowed forth the long and painful discipline\nthrough which the soul must pass before being fully admitted\nto the divine arcanum, “how love is the only good in the world”.\n\nThe poem is one which readily lends itself to an allegorical\ninterpretation.  For such an interpretation, the reader is referred to\nMrs. Owen’s paper, read before the Browning Society of London,\nand contained in the Society’s Papers, Part IV., pp. 49* et seq.\nIt is too long to be given here.\n\n\n\n\nThe Last Ride Together.\n\n\n\n“The speaker is a man who has to give up the woman he loves;\nbut his love is probably reciprocated, however inadequately,\nfor his appeal for ‘a last ride together’ is granted.\nThe poem reflects his changing moods and thoughts as\n‘here we are riding, she and I’.  ‘Fail I alone in words and deeds?\nWhy, all men strive, and who succeeds?’  Careers, even careers\ncalled ‘successful’, pass in review--statesmen, poets, sculptors,\nmusicians--each fails in his ideal, for ideals are not attainable\nin this life of incompletions.  But faith gains something for a man.\nHe has loved this woman.  That is something gained.  If this life gave all,\nwhat were there to look forward to?  ‘Now, heaven and she are beyond\nthis ride.’  Again,--and this is his closing reflection,--\n\n     “‘What if heaven be, that, fair and strong’”, etc.\n\n   --Browning Soc. Papers, V., 144*.\n\n\n\n\nBy the Fireside.\n\n\n\nPerhaps in no other of Mr. Browning’s poems are the spiritual uses of\n“the love of wedded souls” more fully set forth than in the poem,\n‘By the Fireside’.\n\nThe Monologue is addressed by a happy husband to his “perfect wife,\nmy Leonor”.  He looks forward to what he will do when the long,\ndark autumn evenings come--the evenings of declining age,\nwhen the pleasant hue of his soul shall have dimmed, and the music\nof all its spring and summer voices shall be dumb in life’s November.\nIn his “waking dreams” he will “live o’er again” the happy life\nhe has spent with his loved and loving companion.  Passing out\nwhere the backward vista ends, he will survey, with her,\nthe pleasant wood through which they have journeyed together.\nTo the hazel-trees of England, where their childhood passed,\nsucceeds a rarer sort, till, by green degrees, they at last\nslope to Italy, and youth,--Italy, the woman-country,\nloved by earth’s male-lands.  She being the trusted guide,\nthey stand at last in the heart of things, the heaped and dim woods\nall around them, the single and slim thread of water slipping\nfrom slab to slab, the ruined chapel perched half-way up\nin the Alpine gorge, reached by the one-arched bridge\nwhere the water is stopped in a stagnant pond, where all day long\na bird sings, and a stray sheep drinks at times.  Here,\nwhere at afternoon, or almost eve, the silence grows conscious\nto that degree, one half feels it must get rid of what it knows,\nthey walked side by side, arm in arm, and cheek to cheek;\ncross silent the crumbling bridge, pity and praise the sweet chapel,\nread the dead builder’s date, ‘five, six, nine, recross the bridge,\ntake the path again--but wait!  Oh moment one and infinite! the west\nis tender, with its one star, the chrysolite! the sights and sounds,\nthe lights and shades, make up a spell; a moment after,\nand unseen hands are hanging the night around them fast,\nbut they know that a bar has been broken between life and life,\nthat they are mixed at last in spite of the mortal screen.\n\n     “The forests had done it; there they stood;\n     We caught for a moment the powers at play:\n     They had mingled us so, for once and for good,\n     Their work was done--we might go or stay,\n     They relapsed to their ancient mood.”\n\nBrowning everywhere lays great stress on those moments\nof exalted feeling, when the soul has an unchecked play and is\nrevealed to itself.  See in the section of the Introduction\non Personality and Art, the passage quoted from the Canon’s Monologue\nin ‘The Ring and the Book’, and the remarks on conversion.\n\nMr. Nettleship, in his ‘Essays on Browning’s Poetry’,\nhas traced somewhat minutely the symbolical meaning which he sees\nin the scenery and circumstances of ‘By the Fireside’.\nReaders are referred to these Essays.\n\n\n\n\nProspice.\n\n\n\nThe speaker in this noble monologue is one who, having fought\na good fight and finished his course, lived and wrought thoroughly\nin sense, and soul, and intellect, is now ready and eager to encounter\nthe ‘Arch-Fear’, Death; and then he will clasp again his Beloved,\nthe soul of his soul, who has gone before.  He leaves the rest to God.\n\nWith this monologue should be read the mystical description,\nin ‘The Passing of Arthur’ (Tennyson’s Idylls of the King),\nof “the last, dim, weird battle of the west”, beginning,--\n\n     “A deathwhite mist slept over sand and sea.”\n\n\n\n\nAmphibian.\n\n\n\nThis poem is the Prologue to ‘Fifine at the Fair’.\n\nAmphibian is one who unites both lives within himself, the material\nand the spiritual, in complete concord and mutual subservience--\none who “lives and likes life’s way”, and can also free himself\nof tether, leave the solid land, and, unable to fly,\nswim “in the sphere which overbrims with passion and thought”,--\nthe sphere of poetry.  Such an one may be said to be Browning’s\nideal man.  “The value and significance of flesh” is everywhere\nrecognized in his poetry.  “All good things are ours,” Rabbi Ben Ezra\nis made to say, “nor soul helps flesh more, now, than flesh helps soul.”\n The full physical life, in its relation to the spiritual,\nwas never more beautifully sung than it is sung by David,\nin the poem of ‘Saul’.  See the passage beginning, “Oh! our manhood’s\nprime vigor!” and the passage in ‘Balaustion’s Adventure’,\ndescriptive of Hercules, as he returns, after his conflict with Death,\nleading back Alkestis.\n\n\n\n\nJames Lee’s Wife.\n\n\n\nThe original title in ‘Dramatis Personae’ (first published in 1864)\nwas ‘James Lee’.\n\nThe poem consists of a succession of soliloquies (rather than monologues*),\nseparated, it must be supposed, by longer or shorter intervals of time,\nand expressive of subjective states induced in a wife whose husband’s love,\nif it ever were love, indeed, gradually declines to apathy\nand finally entire deadness.  What manner of man James Lee was,\nis only faintly intimated.  The interest centres in, is wholly confined to,\nthe experiences of the wife’s heart, under the circumstances,\nwhatever they were.\n\n    --\n     * For the distinction between the soliloquy and the\n     monologue, see the passage given in a note, from Rev. Prof.\n     Johnson’s paper on ‘Bishop Blougram’s Apology’, under the\n     treatment of the monologue, p. 85 {part III of Intro.}.\n    --\n\nThe scene is a cottage on a “bitter coast of France”.\n\nI.  ‘James Lee’s Wife speaks at the Window’.--The first misgivings\nof her heart are expressed; and these misgivings are responded to\nby the outer world.  Summer has stopped.  Will the summer of\nher husband’s love stop too, and be succeeded by cheerless winter?\nThe revolt of her heart against such a thought is expressed\nin the third stanza.\n\nII.  ‘By the Fireside’.--Here the faintly indefinite misgiving\nexpressed in the first soliloquy has become a gloomy foreboding of ill;\n“the heart shrinks and closes, ere the stroke of doom has attained it.”\n\nThe fire on the hearth is built of shipwreck wood, which tells of\na “dim dead woe befallen this bitter coast of France”,\nand omens to her foreboding heart the shipwreck of their home.\nThe ruddy shaft of light from the casement must, she thinks,\nbe seen by sailors who envy the warm safe house and happy freight.\nBut there are ships in port which go to ruin,\n\n     “All through worms i’ the wood, which crept,\n     Gnawed our hearts out while we slept:\n          That is worse.”\n\nHer mind reverts to the former occupants of their house,\nas if she felt an influence shed within it by some unhappy woman who,\nlike herself, in Love’s voyage, saw planks start and open hell beneath.\n\nIII.  ‘In the Doorway’.--As she looks out from the doorway,\neverything tells of the coming desolation of winter,\nand reflects the desolation which, she feels, is coming upon herself.\nThe swallows are ready to depart, the water is in stripes, black,\nspotted white with the wailing wind.  The furled leaf of the fig-tree,\nin front of their house, and the writhing vines, sympathize with\nher heart and her spirit:--\n\n     “My heart shrivels up and my spirit shrinks curled.”\n\nBut there is to them two, she thinks, no real outward want,\nthat should mar their peace, small as is their house,\nand poor their field.  Why should the change in nature bring change\nto the spirit which should put life in the darkness and cold?\n\n     “Oh, live and love worthily, bear and be bold!\n     Whom Summer made friends of, let Winter estrange.”\n\nIV.  ‘Along the Beach’.--It does not appear that she\nanywhere in the poem addresses her husband, face to face.\nIt is soliloquy throughout.  In this section it does appear,\nmore than in the others, that she is directly addressing him;\nbut it’s better to understand it as a mental expostulation.\nHe wanted her love, and got it, in its fulness; though an expectation\nof all harvest and no dearth was not involved in that fulness of love.\n\nThough love greatens and even glorifies, she knew there was\nmuch in him waste, with many a weed, and plenty of passions\nrun to seed, but a little good grain too.  And such as he was\nshe took him for hers; and he found her his, to watch the olive and\nwait the vine of his nature; and when rivers of oil and wine came not,\nthe failure only proved that he was her whole world, all the same.\nBut he has been averse to, and has resented, the tillage of his nature\nto which she has lovingly devoted herself, feeling it to be a bondage;\n\n     “And ‘tis all an old story, and my despair\n     Fit subject for some new song:”\n\nsuch as the one with which she closes this soliloquy,\nrepresenting a love which cares only for outside charms\n(which, later in the poem, we learn she has not) and looks not deeper.\n\nV.  ‘On the Cliff’.--Leaning on the barren turf, which is dead\nto the roots, and looking at a rock, flat as an anvil’s face,\nand left dry by the surf, with no trace of living thing about it\n(Death’s altar by the lone shore), she sees a cricket spring gay,\nwith films of blue, upon the parched turf, and a beautiful butterfly\nsettle and spread its two red fans, on the rock.  And then there is\nto her, wholly taken up, as she is, with their beauty,\n\n     “No turf, no rock; in their ugly stead,\n     See, wonderful blue and red!”\n\nand they symbolize to her, Love settling unawares upon men,\nthe level and low, the burnt and bare, in themselves\n(as are the turf and the rock).\n\nVI.  ‘Reading a Book, under the Cliff’.--The first six stanzas\nof this section she reads from a book. *\n\n    --\n     * They were composed by Mr. Browning when in his 23d year,\n     and published in 1836, in ‘The Monthly Repository’, vol. x.,\n     pp. 270, 271, and entitled simply ‘Lines’.  They were\n     revised and introduced into this section of ‘James Lee’,\n     which was published in ‘Dramatis Personae’ in 1864.\n    --\n\nHer experiences have carried her beyond what these Lines convey,\nand she speaks of them somewhat sarcastically and ironically.\nThis “young man”, she thinks, will be wiser in time,\n\n                    “for kind\n     Calm years, exacting their accompt\n     Of pain, mature the mind:”\n\nand then the wind, when it begins among the vines, so low, so low,\nwill have for him another language; such as this:--\n\n     “Here is the change beginning, here the lines\n     Circumscribe beauty, set to bliss\n     The limit time assigns.”\n\nThis is the language SHE has learned:  We cannot draw one beauty\ninto our hearts’ core, and keep it changeless.  This is the old woe\nof the world; the tune, to whose rise and fall we live and die.\nRISE WITH IT, THEN!  REJOICE THAT MAN IS HURLED FROM CHANGE\nTO CHANGE UNCEASINGLY, HIS SOUL’S WINGS NEVER FURLED!\nTo this philosophy of life has she been brought.  But she must still\nsadly reflect how bitter it is for man not to grave, on his soul,\none fair, good, wise thing just as he grasped it!  For himself\ndeath’s wave; while time washes (ah, the sting!) o’er all he’d sink\nto save.\n\nThis reflection must be understood, in her own case, as prompted by\nher unconquerable wifely love.  It is this which points the sting.\n\nVII.  ‘Among the Rocks’.--The brown old earth, in autumn,\nwhen all the glories of summer are fading, or have faded,\nwears a good gigantic smile, looking not backward, but forward,\nwith his feet in the ripples of the sea-wash, and listening to\nthe sweet twitters of the ‘white-breasted sea-lark’.  The entire stanza\nhas a mystical meaning and must be interpreted in its connection.\n\nShe has reached, in this soliloquy, high ground:--\n\n     “If you loved only what were worth your love,\n     Love were clear gain, and wholly well for you:\n     Make the low nature better by your throes!\n     GIVE EARTH YOURSELF, GO UP FOR GAIN ABOVE!”\n\nThe versification of the first stanza of this section is very lovely,\nand subtly responsive to the feeling.  It exhibits\nthe completest inspiration.  No mere metrical skill,\nnor metrical sensibility even, could have produced it.\n\nVIII.  ‘Beside the Drawing-Board’.--She is seated at\nher drawing-board, and has turned from the poor coarse hand\nof some little peasant girl she has called in as a model,\nto work, but with poor success, after a clay cast of\na hand by Leonardo da Vinci, who\n\n     “Drew and learned and loved again,\n     While fast the happy moments flew,\n     Till beauty mounted into his brain\n     And on the finger which outvied\n     His art, he placed the ring that’s there,\n     Still by fancy’s eye descried,\n     In token of a marriage rare:\n     For him on earth his art’s despair,\n     For him in heaven his soul’s fit bride.”\n\nHer effort has taught her a wholesome lesson:  “the worth of\nflesh and blood at last!”  There’s something more than beauty in a hand.\nDa Vinci would not have turned from the poor coarse hand of the little girl\nwho has been standing by in wondering patience.  He, great artist\nas he was, owed all he achieved to his firm grasp upon, and struggle with,\nand full faith in, the real.  She imagines him saying:--\n\n     “Shall earth and the cramped moment-space\n     Yield the heavenly crowning grace?\n     Now the parts and then the whole! *\n     Who art thou with stinted soul\n     And stunted body, thus to cry\n     ‘I love,--shall that be life’s strait dole?\n     I must live beloved or die!’\n     This peasant hand that spins the wool\n     And bakes the bread, why lives it on,\n     Poor and coarse with beauty gone,--\n     What use survives the beauty?  Fool!”\n\n    --\n     * “On the earth the broken arcs; in the heaven, a perfect\n     round.”--Abt Vogler.\n    --\n\nShe has been brought to the last stage of initiation into the mystery\nof Life.  But, as is shown in the next and final section of the poem,\nthe wifely heart has preserved its vitality, has, indeed,\ngrown in vitality, and cherishes a hope which shows its undying love,\nand is not without a touch of pathos.\n\nIX.  ‘On Deck’.--In Sections V.-VIII. the soliloquies are not\ndirected to the husband, as they are in I.-IV.  In this last,\nhe is again mentally addressed.  She is on board the vessel\nwhich is to convey, or is conveying, her to her English home,\nor somewhere else.  As there is nothing in her for him to remember,\nnothing in her art efforts he cares to see, nothing she was\nthat deserves a place in his mind, she leaves him, sets him free,\nas he has long shown to her he has wished to be.  She,\nconceding his attitude toward her, asks him to concede,\nin turn, that such a thing as mutual love HAS been.\nThere’s a slight retaliation here of the wounded spirit.\nBut her heart, after all, MUST have its way; and it cherishes\nthe hope that his soul, which is now cabined, cribbed, confined,\nmay be set free, through some circumstance or other,\nand she may then become to him what he is to her.  And then,\nwhat would it matter to her that she was ill-favored?\nAll sense of this would be sunk in the strange joy that\nhe possessed her as she him, in heart and brain.  Hers has been a love\nthat was life, and a life that was love.  Could one touch\nof such love for her come in a word of look of his, why,\nhe might turn into her ill-favoredness, she would know nothing of it,\nbeing dead to joy.\n\n\n\n\nA Tale.\n\n(The Epilogue to ‘The Two Poets of Croisic’.)\n\n\nThe speaker in this monologue is the wife of a poet,\nand she tells the story to her husband, of the little cricket\nthat came to the aid of the musician who was contending for a prize,\nwhen one of the strings of his lyre snapped.  So he made a statue\nfor himself, and on the lyre he held perched his partner in the prize.\nIf her poet-husband gain a prize in poetry, she asks, will some ticket\nwhen his statue’s built tell the gazer ‘twas a cricket helped\nhis crippled lyre; that when one string which made “love” sound soft,\nwas snapt in twain, she perched upon the place left vacant\nand duly uttered, “Love, Love, Love”, whene’er the bass\nasked the treble to atone for its somewhat sombre drone?\n\n\n\n\nConfessions.\n\n\n\nThe speaker is a dying man, who replies very decidedly in the negative\nto the question of the attendant priest as to whether he views\nthe world as a vale of tears.  The memory of a past love,\nwhich is running through his mind, still keeps the world bright.\nOf the stolen interviews with the girl he loved he makes confession,\nusing the physic bottles which stand on a table by the bedside\nto illustrate his story.\n\nThe monologue is a choice bit of grotesque humor touched with pathos.\n\n\n\n\nRespectability.\n\n\n\nBy the title of the poem is meant respectability according to\nthe standard of the beau monde.\n\nThe speaker is a woman, as is indicated in the third stanza.\nThe monologue is addressed to her lover.\n\nStanza 1 shows that they have disregarded the conventionalities\nof the beau monde.  Had they conformed to them, many precious months\nand years would have passed before they found out the world\nand what it fears.  One cannot well judge of any state of things\nwhile in it.  It must be looked at from the outside.\n\nStanza 2.  The idea is repeated in a more special form\nin the first four verses of the stanza; and in the last four\ntheir own non-conventional and Bohemian life is indicated.\n\nStanza 3, vv. 1-4.  The speaker knows that this beau monde\ndoes not proscribe love, provided it be in accordance with\nthe proprieties which IT has determined upon and established.\nv. 5.  “The world’s good word!” a contemptuous exclamation:\nwhat’s the world’s good word worth? “the Institute!” (the reference is,\nof course, to the French Institute), the Institute! with all its\nauthoritative, dictatorial learnedness!  v.6.  Guizot and Montalembert\nwere both members of the Institute, and being thus in the same boat,\nGuizot conventionally receives Montalembert.  vv. 7 and 8.  These two\nunconventional Bohemian lovers, strolling together at night,\nat their own sweet will, see down the court along which\nthey are strolling, three lampions flare, which indicate some big place\nor other where the “respectables” do congregate; and the woman\nsays to her companion, with a humorous sarcasm, “Put forward\nyour best foot!” that is, we must be very correct passing along here\nin this brilliant light.\n\nBy the two lovers are evidently meant George Sand (the speaker)\nand Jules Sandeau, with whom she lived in Paris, after she left\nher husband, M. Dudevant.  They took just such unconventional\nnight-strolls together, in the streets of Paris.\n\n\n\n\nHome-Thoughts from Abroad.\n\n\n\nAn Englishman, in some foreign land, longs for England,\nnow that April’s there, with its peculiar English charms;\nand then will come May, with the white-throat and the swallows, and,\nmost delightful of all, the thrush, with its rapturous song!\nAnd the buttercups, far brighter than the gaudy melon-flower\nhe has before him!\n\n\n\n\nHome-Thoughts from the Sea.\n\n\n\nA paean, inspired by the sight, from the sea, of Cape Trafalgar\nand Gibraltar, both objects of patriotic pride to an Englishman;\nthe one associated with the naval victory gained by the English fleet,\nunder Nelson, over the combined French and Spanish fleets; the other,\nEngland’s greatest stronghold.\n\nThe first four verses make a characteristic Turner picture.\n\n\n\n\nOld Pictures in Florence.\n\n\n\nThe speaker in the monologue is looking down upon Florence,\nin the valley beneath, from a villa on one of the surrounding heights.\nThe startling bell-tower Giotto raised more than startles him.\n(For an explanation of this, see note under Stanza 2.)\nAlthough the poem presents a general survey of the old\nFlorentine masters, the THEME of the poem is really Giotto,\nwho received the affectionate homage of the Florentines,\nin his own day, and for whom the speaker has a special love.\nThe poem leads up to the prophesied restoration of Freedom to Florence,\nthe return of Art, that departed with her, and the completion\nof the Campanile, which will vindicate Giotto and Florence together,\nand crown the restoration of freedom to the city, and its liberation\nfrom the hated Austrian rule.\n\nMrs. Browning’s ‘Casa Guidi Windows’ should be read in connection with\nthis monologue.  The strong sympathy which is expressed\nin the last few stanzas of the monologue, with Italian liberty,\nis expressed in ‘Casa Guidi Windows’ at a white heat.\n\n“We find,” says Professor Dowden, “a full confession\nof Mr. Browning’s creed with respect to art in the poem entitled\n‘Old Pictures in Florence’.  He sees the ghosts of the early\nChristian masters, whose work has never been duly appreciated,\nstanding sadly by each mouldering Italian Fresco; and when\nan imagined interlocutor inquires what is admirable in such work\nas this, the poet answers that the glory of Christian art lies\nin its rejecting a limited perfection, such as that of the art\nof ancient Greece, the subject of which was finite, and the lesson\ntaught by which was submission, and in its daring to be incomplete,\nand faulty, faulty because its subject was great with infinite fears\nand hopes, and because it must needs teach man not to submit\nbut to aspire.”\n\n\n\n\nPictor Ignotus.\n\n{Florence, 15--.}\n\n\nAn unknown painter reflects, but without envy, upon the praise which\nhas been bestowed on a youthful artist,--what that praise involves.\nHe himself was conscious of all the power, and more,\nwhich the youth has shown; no bar stayed, nor fate forbid,\nto exercise it, nor would flesh have shrunk from seconding his soul.\nAll he saw he could have put upon canvas;\n\n     “Each face obedient to its passion’s law,\n     Each passion clear proclaimed without a tongue.”\n\nAnd when he thought how sweet would be the earthly fame which his work\nwould bring him, “the thought grew frightful, ‘twas so wildly dear!”\n But a vision flashed before him and changed that thought.  Along with\nthe loving, trusting ones were cold faces, that begun to press on him\nand judge him.  Such as these would buy and sell his pictures for\ngarniture and household-stuff.  His pictures, so sacred to his soul,\nwould be the subject of their prate, “This I love, or this I hate,\nthis likes me more, and this affects me less!”  To avoid such sacrilege,\nhe has chosen his portion.  And if his heart sometimes sinks,\nwhile at his monotonous work of painting endless cloisters\nand eternal aisles, with the same series, Virgin, Babe, and Saint,\nwith the same cold, calm, beautiful regard, at least no merchant\ntraffics in his heart.  Guarded by the sanctuary’s gloom,\nfrom vain tongues, his pictures may die, surely, gently die.\n\n     “O youth, men praise so,--holds their praise its worth?\n     Tastes sweet the water with such specks of earth?”\n\n\n\n\nAndrea del Sarto.\n\n(Called “The Faultless Painter”.)\n\n\nIn this monologue, “the faultless painter” (Andrea Senza Errori,\nas he was surnamed by the Italians) is the speaker.\nHe addresses his worthless wife, Lucrezia, upon whom he weakly dotes,\nand for whom he has broken faith with his royal patron,\nFrancis I. of France, in order that he might meet her demands\nfor money, to be spent upon her pleasures.  He laments that he\nhas fallen below himself as an artist, that he has not realized\nthe possibilities of his genius, half accusing, from the better side\nof his nature, and half excusing, in his uxoriousness,\nthe woman who has had no sympathy with him in the high ideals which,\nwith her support, he might have realized, and thus have placed himself\nbeside Angelo and Rafael.  “Had the mouth then urged\n‘God and the glory! never care for gain.  The present by the future,\nwhat is that?  Live for fame, side by side with Angelo--\nRafael is waiting.  Up to God all three!’  I might have done it for you.”\n\nIn his ‘Comparative Study of Tennyson and Browning’ *,\nProfessor Edward Dowden, setting forth Browning’s doctrines\non the subject of Art, remarks:--\n\n    --\n     * Originally a lecture, delivered in 1868, and published in\n     ‘Afternoon Lectures on Literature and Art’ (Dublin), 5th\n     series, 1869; afterwards revised, and included in the\n     author’s ‘Studies in Literature, 1789-1877’.  It is one of\n     the best criticisms of Browning’s poetry that have yet been\n     produced.  Every Browning student should make a careful\n     study of it.\n    --\n\n“The true glory of art is, that in its creation there arise desires\nand aspirations never to be satisfied on earth, but generating\nnew desires and new aspirations, by which the spirit of man\nmounts to God Himself.  The artist (Mr. Browning loves to insist\non this point) who can realize in marble or in color, or in music,\nhis ideal, has thereby missed the highest gain of art.\nIn ‘Pippa Passes’ the regeneration of the young sculptor’s work turns\non his finding that in the very perfection which he had attained\nlies ultimate failure.  And one entire poem, ‘Andrea del Sarto’,\nhas been devoted to the exposition of this thought.\nAndrea is ‘the faultless painter’; no line of his drawing ever goes astray;\nhis hand expressed adequately and accurately all that his mind conceives;\nbut for this very reason, precisely because he is ‘the faultless painter’,\nhis work lacks the highest qualities of art:--\n\n          “‘A man’s reach should exceed his grasp,\n     Or what’s a Heaven for? all is silver-grey,\n     Placid and perfect with my art--the worse.’\n\n“And in the youthful Raphael, whose technical execution fell so far\nbelow his own, Andrea recognizes the true master:--\n\n     “‘Yonder’s a work, now, of that famous youth’, etc.\n\n“In Andrea del Sarto,” says Vasari, “art and nature combined to show\nall that may be done in painting, where design, coloring, and invention\nunite in one and the same person.  Had this master possessed\na somewhat bolder and more elevated mind, had he been\nas much distinguished for higher qualifications as he was for genius\nand depth of judgment in the art he practised, he would,\nbeyond all doubt, have been without an equal.  But there was\na certain timidity of mind, a sort of diffidence and want of force\nin his nature, which rendered it impossible that those evidences\nof ardor and animation which are proper to the more exalted character,\nshould ever appear in him; nor did he at any time display\none particle of that elevation which, could it but have been added to\nthe advantages wherewith he was endowed, would have rendered him\na truly divine painter:  wherefore the works of Andrea are wanting\nin those ornaments of grandeur, richness, and force,\nwhich appear so conspicuously in those of many other masters.\nHis figures are, nevertheless, well drawn, they are entirely\nfree from errors, and perfect in all their proportions,\nand are for the most part simple and chaste:  the expression\nof his heads is natural and graceful in women and children,\nwhile in youths and old men it is full of life and animation.\nThe draperies of this master are beautiful to a marvel,\nand the nude figures are admirably executed, the drawing is simple,\nthe coloring is most exquisite, nay, it is truly divine.”\n\n\nMr. Ernest Radford, quoting this passage, in the Browning Society’s\n‘Illustrations to Browning’s Poems’, remarks that “nearly the whole\nPOEM of ‘Andrea del Sarto’ is a mere translation into\nthe SUBJECTIVE Mood (if I may so say) of this passage in which\nthe painter’s work is criticised from an external standpoint. . . .\n\n“Recent researches into Andrea’s life throw doubt upon a good deal\nthat Vasari has written concerning the unhappiness of his marriage\nand the manner of his death.  And the biographer himself modifies,\nin his second edition, the account he had given of the fair Lucrezia.\nVasari, it should be said, was a pupil of Andrea, and therefore must,\nin this instance, have had special opportunities of knowledge,\nthough he may, on the same account, have had some special ‘animus’\nwhen he wrote.  For the purposes of his poem, Browning is content\nto take the traditional account of the matter, which, after all,\nseems to substantially accurate.  The following is from\nthe first edition:--\n\n\n“At that time there was a most beautiful girl in Via di San Gallo,\nwho was married to a cap-maker, and who, though born of a poor\nand vicious father, carried about her as much pride and haughtiness,\nas beauty and fascination.  She delighted in trapping the hearts\nof men, and amongst others ensnared the unlucky Andrea,\nwhose immoderate love for her soon caused him to neglect the studies\ndemanded by his art, and in great measure to discontinue the assistance\nwhich he had given to his parents.\n\n“Certain pictures of Andrea’s which had been painted for\nthe King of France were received with much favor, and an invitation\nto Andrea soon followed their delivery, to ‘go and paint\nat the French Court’.  He went accordingly, and ‘painted proudly’,\nas Browning relates, and prospered every way.  But one day,\nbeing employed on the figure of a St. Jerome doing penance,\nwhich he was painting for the mother of the King, there came to him\ncertain letters from Florence; these were written him by his wife;\nand from that time (whatever may have been the cause) he began\nto think of leaving France.  He asked permission to that effect\nfrom the French King accordingly, saying that he desired to\nreturn to Florence, but that, when he had arranged his affairs\nin that city, he would return without fail to his Majesty; he added,\nthat when he came back, his wife should accompany him, to the end that\nhe might remain in France the more quietly; and that he would bring\nwith him pictures and sculptures of great value.  The King,\nconfiding in these promises, gave him money for the purchase of\nthose pictures and sculptures, Andrea taking an oath on the gospels\nto return within the space of a few months, and that done\nhe departed to his native city.\n\n“He arrived safely in Florence, enjoying the society\nof his beautiful wife, and that of his friends, with the sight\nof his native city, during several months; but when the period\nspecified by the King, and that at which he ought to have returned,\nhad come and passed, he found himself at the end, not only of\nhis own money, but, what with building” (the “melancholy little house\nthey built to be so gay with”) “indulging himself with\nvarious pleasures, and doing no work, of that belonging to\nthe French monarch also, the whole of which he had consumed.\nHe was, nevertheless, determined to return to France, but the prayers\nand tears of his wife had more power than his own necessities,\nor the faith which he had pledged to the King.”\n\n\n“And so for a pretty woman’s sake, was a great nature degraded.\nAnd out of sympathy with its impulses, broad, and deep,\nand tender as only the greatest can show, ‘Andrea del Sarto’,\nour great, sad poem, was written.”\n\nThe monologue exhibits great perfection of finish.  Its composition\nwas occasioned, as Mr. Furnivall learned from the poet himself\n(see ‘Browning Society’s Papers’, Part II., p. 161),\nby the portrait of Andrea del Sarto and his wife, painted by himself,\nand now in the Pitti Palace, in Florence.  Mr. Browning’s friend,\nand his wife’s friend, Mr. John Kenyon (the same to whom Mrs. Browning\ndedicated ‘Aurora Leigh’), had asked the poet to buy him a copy\nof Andrea del Sarto’s picture.  None could be got, and so Mr. Browning\nput into a poem what the picture had said to himself, and sent it\nto Mr. Kenyon.  It was certainly a worthy substitute.\n\n\n\n\nFra Lippo Lippi.\n\n\n\nThe Italian artist, Lippi, is the speaker.  Lippi was one\nof the representatives of the protest made in the fifteenth century\nagainst the conventional spiritualization in the art of his time.\nIn the monologue he gives expression to his faith in the real,\nin the absolute spiritual significance of the lineaments\nof the human face, and in the forms of nature.  The circumstances\nunder which this faith is expressed, are somewhat droll.\nLippi was a wild fellow and given to excesses of various kinds.\nWhen a boy he took refuge against starvation in the convent\nof the Carmelites, in Florence, and became a monk; but he proved\nunfaithful to his religious vows, and, impelled by his genius for art,\nmade his escape from the convent, having first profited by the work\nof Masaccio, and devoted himself to painting.  After many\nromantic experiences, and having risen to distinction in his art,\nhe returned to Florence and became known to Cosimo de’ Medici,\nin whose employ he is at the time he is presented to us\nin the monologue.  It appears he had been shut up by his patron,\nfor three weeks, in order to be kept at work, “a-painting for\nthe great man, saints and saints and saints again.  I could not paint\nall night--Ouf! I leaned out of window for fresh air.\nThere came a hurry of feet, and little feet, a sweep of lutestrings,\nlaughs, and whifts of song,”--etc.  In his eagerness\nto join in the fun, he tears into shreds curtain, and counterpane,\nand coverlet, makes a rope, descends, and comes up with the fun\nhard by Saint Laurence, hail fellow, well met.  On his way back\ntoward daybreak, he is throttled by the police, and it is to them\nthe monologue is addressed.  He ingratiates himself with them\nby telling his history, and by his talk on art, and a most interesting\nand deeply significant talk it is, the gist of it being well expressed\nin a passage of Mrs. Browning’s ‘Aurora Leigh’, “paint a body well,\nyou paint a soul by implication, like the grand first Master. . . .\nWithout the spiritual, observe, the natural’s impossible;--\nno form, no motion!  Without sensuous, spiritual is inappreciable;--\nno beauty or power!  And in this twofold sphere the two-fold man\n(and still the artist is intensely a man) holds firmly by the natural,\nto reach the spiritual beyond it,--fixes still the type\nwith mortal vision, to pierce through, with eyes immortal,\nto the antetype, some call the ideal,--better called the real,\nand certain to be called so presently when things shall have\ntheir names.”\n\nBrowning has closely followed, in the monologue, the art-historian,\nGiorgio Vasari, as the following extracts will show (the translation\nis that of Mrs. Jonathan Foster, in the Bohn Library):--\n\n\n“The Carmelite monk, Fra Filippo di Tommaso Lippi (1412-1469) *1*\nwas born at Florence in a bye-street called Ardiglione,\nunder the Canto alla Cuculia, and behind the convent of the Carmelites.\nBy the death of his father he was left a friendless orphan at the age\nof two years, his mother having also died shortly after his birth.\nThe child was for some time under the care of a certain Mona Lapaccia,\nhis aunt, the sister of his father, who brought him up\nwith very great difficulty till he had attained his eighth year, when,\nbeing no longer able to support the burden of his maintenance,\nshe placed him in the above-named convent of the Carmelites.\nHere, in proportion as he showed himself dexterous and ingenious\nin all works performed by hand, did he manifest the utmost dulness\nand incapacity in letters, to which he would never apply himself,\nnor would he take any pleasure in learning of any kind.  The boy continued\nto be called by his worldly name of Filippo, *2* and being placed\nwith others, who like himself were in the house of the novices,\nunder the care of the master, to the end that the latter might see\nwhat could be done with him; in place of studying, he never did\nanything but daub his own books, and those of the other boys,\nwith caricatures, whereupon the prior determined to give him\nall means and every opportunity for learning to draw.\nThe chapel of the Carmine had then been newly painted by Masaccio,\nand this being exceedingly beautiful, pleased Fra Filippo greatly,\nwherefore he frequented it daily for his recreation, and,\ncontinually practising there, in company with many other youths,\nwho were constantly drawing in that place, he surpassed all the others\nby very much in dexterity and knowledge. . . .  Proceeding thus,\nand improving from day to day, he had so closely followed\nthe manner of Masaccio, and his works displayed so much similarity\nto those of the latter, that many affirmed the spirit of Masaccio\nto have entered the body of Fra Filippo. . . .\n\n    --\n     *1* The date of birth differs in the biographies, it being\n     variously given as 1400, 1406, 1410, and 1412.  But the\n     latter appears to be the one generally accepted.\n\n     *2* It was customary, on entering a convent, to change the\n     baptismal name for some other.\n    --\n\n“It is said that Fra Filippo was much addicted to the pleasures\nof sense, insomuch that he would give all he possessed to secure\nthe gratification of whatever inclination might at the moment\nbe predominant; . . .  It was known that, while occupied\nin the pursuit of his pleasures, the works undertaken by him\nreceived little or none of his attention; for which reason\nCosimo de’ Medici, wishing him to execute a work in his own palace,\nshut him up, that he might not waste his time in running about;\nbut having endured this confinement for two days, he then made ropes\nwith the sheets of his bed, which he cut to pieces for that purpose,\nand so having let himself down from a window, escaped,\nand for several days gave himself up to his amusements.\nWhen Cosimo found that the painter had disappeared, he caused him\nto be sought, and Fra Filippo at last returned to his work,\nbut from that time forward Cosimo gave him liberty to go in and out\nat his pleasure, repenting greatly of having previously shut him up,\nwhen he considered the danger that Fra Filippo had incurred by\nhis folly in descending from the window; and ever afterwards laboring\nto keep him to his work by kindness only, he was by this means\nmuch more promptly and effectually served by the painter,\nand was wont to say that the excellencies of rare genius\nwere as forms of light and not beasts of burden.”\n\n\n\n\nA Face.\n\n\n\nThe speaker imagines the head of a beautiful girl he knows,\n“painted upon a background of pale gold, such as the Tuscan’s\nearly art prefers”, and details the picture as he would have it.\n\n\n\n\nThe Bishop orders his Tomb.\n\nThe Bishop orders his Tomb at St. Praxed’s Church. *\n{Rome, 15--.}\n\n    --\n     * First published in ‘Hood’s Magazine’, March, 1845, No.\n     III., vol. iii., pp. 237-239, under the title ‘The Tomb at\n     St. Praxed’s (Rome, 15--)’.\n\n     “This poem and ‘The Flight of the Duchess’ were sent by\n     Browning to help make up the numbers of the magazine while\n     Hood lay dying.”--Furnivall’s ‘Bibliography of Robert\n     Browning’, p. 48.\n    --\n\n\nThe dying Bishop pleads with his natural sons that they give him\nthe sumptuous tomb they stand pledged to,--such a tomb\nas will excite the envy of his old enemy Gandolf, who cheated him out\nof a favorite niche in St. Praxed’s Church, by dying before him,\nand securing it for his tomb.\n\nIt is not necessary to suppose that the natural sons are present.\nHis, perhaps, delirious mind is occupied with the precious\nmarbles and stones and other luxuries he has loved to much,\nand with his old rival and enemy, Gandolf.\n\nJohn Ruskin, in his ‘Modern Painters’ (Vol. IV., chap. XX.,\nSection 32), remarks:--\n\n\n“Robert Browning is unerring in every sentence he writes\nof the Middle Ages; always vital, right, and profound;\nso that in the matter of art, . . .there is hardly a principle\nconnected with the mediaeval temper, that he has not struck upon\nin those seemingly careless and too rugged rhymes of his.\nThere is a curious instance, by the way, in a short poem *1*\nreferring to this very subject of tomb and image sculpture;\nall illustrating just one of those phases of local human character\nwhich, though belonging to Shakespeare’s own age, he {Shakespeare}\nnever noticed, because it was specially Italian and un-English;\nconnected also closely with the influence of mountains on the heart,\nand therefore with our immediate inquiries.*2*  I mean the kind\nof admiration with which a southern artist regarded the STONE he worked in;\nand the pride which populace or priest took in the possession of precious\nmountain substance, worked into the pavements of their cathedrals,\nand the shafts of their tombs.\n\n    --\n     *1* ‘The Bishop orders his Tomb in St. Praxed’s Church’.\n\n     *2* ‘The Mountain Glory’, the subject of the chapter from which\n     this is taken.\n    --\n\n“Observe, Shakespeare, in the midst of architecture and tombs of wood,\nor freestone, or brass, naturally thinks of GOLD as the best\nenriching and ennobling substance for them; in the midst also\nof the fever of the Renaissance he writes, as every one else did,\nin praise of precisely the most vicious master of that school--\nGiulio Romano*; but the modern poet, living much in Italy,\nand quit of the Renaissance influence, is able fully to enter into\nthe Italian feeling, and to see the evil of the Renaissance tendency,\nnot because he is greater than Shakespeare, but because he is in\nanother element, and has seen other things. . . .\n\n    --\n     * ‘Winter’s Tale’, V. 2. 106.\n    --\n\n“I know no other piece of modern English, prose or poetry,\nin which there is so much told, as in these lines {‘The Bishop orders\nhis Tomb’}, of the Renaissance spirit,--its worldliness,\ninconsistency, pride, hypocrisy, ignorance of itself, love of art,\nof luxury, and of good Latin.  It is nearly all that I said\nof the Central Renaissance in thirty pages of the ‘Stones of Venice’\nput into as many lines, Browning’s being also the antecedent work.\nThe worst of it is that this kind of concentrated writing needs\nso much SOLUTION before the reader can fairly get the good of it,\nthat people’s patience fails them, and they give the thing up\nas insoluble; though, truly, it ought to be to the current\nof common thought like Saladin’s talisman, dipped in clear water,\nnot soluble altogether, but making the element medicinable.”\n\n\nProfessor Dowden, in regard to Mr. Browning’s doctrines on\nthe subject of art, remarks:--\n\n\n“It is always in an unfavorable light that he depicts the virtuoso\nor collector, who, conscious of no unsatisfied aspirations\nsuch as those which make the artist’s joy and sorrow,\nrests in the visible products of art, and looks up to nothing\nabove or beyond them. . . .  The unbelieving and worldly spirit\nof the dying Bishop, who orders his tomb at St. Praxed’s,\nhis sense of the vanity of the world simply because the world\nis passing out of his reach, the regretful memory of the pleasures\nof his youth, the envious spite towards Gandolf, who robbed him of\nthe best position for a tomb, and the dread lest his reputed sons\nshould play him false and fail to carry out his designs,\nare united with a perfect appreciation of Renaissance art,\nand a luxurious satisfaction, which even a death-bed cannot destroy,\nin the splendor of voluptuous form and color.  The great lump\nof lapis lazuli,\n\n     “‘Big as a Jew’s head cut off at the nape,\n     Blue as a vein o’er the Madonna’s breast’,\n\nmust poise between his sculptured knees; the black basalt\nmust contrast with the bas-relief in bronze below:--\n\n     “‘St. Praxed in a glory, and one Pan\n     Ready to twitch the Nymph’s last garment off’;\n\nthe inscription must be ‘choice Latin, picked phrase, Tully’s every word’.”\n\n\n\n\nA Toccata of Galuppi’s.\n\n\nThe speaker is listening to a Toccata of Galuppi’s, and the music tells him\nof how they lived once in Venice, where the merchants were the kings.\nHe was never out of England, yet it’s as if he SAW it all,\nthrough what is addressed to the ear alone.\n\nBut the music does more than reflect the life of mirth and folly\nwhich was led in the gay and voluptuous city.  It has an undertone\nof sadness; its lesser thirds so plaintive, its sixths diminished,\nsigh on sigh, tell the votaries of pleasure something;\nits suspensions, its solutions, its commiserating sevenths,\nawaken in them the question of their hold on life.  That question\nthe music answers.\n\n\n\n\nAbt Vogler.\n\n(After he has been extemporizing upon the musical instrument\nof his invention.)\n\n\nThe Abbe Georg Joseph Vogler was born at Wuerzburg (Bavaria),\nJune 15, 1749; appointed Kappelmeister to the King of Sweden,\nin 1786.  While in this capacity, the “musical instrument\nof his invention”, called the Orchestrion, was constructed; *\nwent to London with his organ, in 1790, and gave a series\nof successful concerts, realizing some 1200 Pounds,\nand making a name as an organist; commissioned to reconstruct\nthe organ of the Pantheon on the plan of his Orchestrion; and later,\nreceived like commissions at Copenhagen and at Neu Ruppin in Prussia;\nfounded a school of music at Copenhagen, and published there\nmany works; in 1807 was appointed by the Grand Duke, Louis I.,\nKappelmeister at Darmstadt; founded there his last school,\ntwo of his pupils being Weber and Meyerbeer; died in 1814.\nBrowning presents Vogler as a great extemporizer, in which character\nhe appears to have been the most famous.  For a further account,\nsee Miss Eleanor Marx’s paper on the Abbe Vogler, from which\nthe above facts have been derived (‘Browning Soc. Papers’, Pt. III.,\npp. 339-343).  Her authorities are Fetis’s ‘Biogr. Univ. des Musiciens’\nand Nisard’s ‘Vie de l’Abbe Vogler’.\n\n    --\n     * “This was a very compact organ, in which four key-boards\n     of five octaves each, and a pedal board of thirty-six keys,\n     with swell complete, were packed into a cube of nine feet.\n     See Fetis’s ‘Biographie Universelle des Musiciens’.--G. Grove.”\n      ‘Note to Miss Marx’s Art. on Vogler’.\n    --\n\nMrs. Turnbull, in her paper on ‘Abt Vogler’ (‘Browning Soc. Papers’,\nPt. IV., pp. 469-476), has so well traced the argument\nof the monologue, that I cannot do better than quote the portion\nof her paper in which she presents it:--\n\n\n“Abt Vogler has been extemporizing on his instrument,\npouring out through it all his feelings of yearning and aspiration;\nand now, waking from his state of absorption, excited,\nand trembling with excess of emotion, he breaks out into the wish,\n‘Would it might tarry!’  In verses {stanzas} one and two\nhe compares the music he has made to a palace, which Solomon\n(as legends of the Koran relate) summoned all creatures,\nby the magic name on his ring, to raise for the princess he loved;\nso all the keys, joyfully submitting to the magic power of the master,\ncombine to aid him, the low notes rushing in like demons to give him\nthe base on which to build his airy structure; the high notes\nlike angels throwing decoration of carving and tracery on pinnacle\nand flying buttress, till in verse three its outline, rising ever\nhigher and higher, shows in the clouds like St. Peter’s dome,\nilluminated and towering into the vasty sky; and it seems\nas if his soul, upborne on the surging waves of music,\nhad reached its highest elevation.  But no.  Influences from without,\ninexplicable, unexpected, join to enhance his own attempts;\nthe heavens themselves seem to bow down and to flash forth\ninconceivable splendors on his amazed spirit, till the limitations\nof time and space are gone--‘there is no more near nor far’.\n\n“. . .In this strange fusion of near and far, of heaven and earth,\npresences hover, spirits of those long dead or of those yet to be,\nlured by the power of music to return to life, or to begin it.\nFigures are dimly descried in the fervor and passion of music,\neven as of old in the glare and glow of the fiery furnace.\n\n“Verses four and five are a bold attempt to describe the indescribable,\nto shadow forth that strange state of clairvoyance when the soul\nshakes itself free from all external impressions, which Vogel tells us\nwas the case with Schubert, and which is true of all great composers--\n‘whether in the body or out of the body, I cannot say’.\n\n“In the sixth verse we come to a comparison of music with\nthe other arts.  Poetry, painting, and sculpture deal with actual form,\nand the tangible realities of life.  They are subject to laws,\nand we know how they are produced; can watch the painting grow\nbeneath the artist’s touches, or the poem take shape line by line.\n\n“True it needs the soul of the artist to combine and to interfuse\nthe elements with which he wishes to create any true work of art,\nbut music is almost entirely independent of earthly element in which\nto clothe and embody itself.  It does not allow of a realistic conception,\nbut without intermediate means is in a direct line from God,\nand enables us to comprehend that Power which created all things\nout of nothing, with whom TO WILL and TO DO are one and the same.\n\n“Schopenhauer says, ‘There is no sound in Nature fit to serve\nthe musician as a model, or to supply him with more than\nan occasional suggestion for his sublime purpose.  He approaches\nthe original sources of existence more closely than all other artists,\nnay, even than Nature herself.’\n\n“Heine has also noticed this element of miracle, which coincides exactly\nwith Browning’s view expressed in the lines:--\n\n     “‘Here is the finger of God, a flash of the will that can,\n     Existent behind all laws, that made them, and, lo, they are!’\n\nNow, these seven verses contain the music of the poem;\nin the remaining ones we pass to Browning’s Platonic philosophy.\n\n“In the eighth verse a sad thought of the banished music obtrudes--\n‘never to be again’.  So wrapt was he in the emotions evoked,\nhe had no time to think of what tones called them up, and now\nall is past and gone.  His magic palace, unlike that of Solomon,\nhas ‘melted into air, into thin air’, and, ‘like the baseless fabric\nof a vision’, only the memory of it is left. . . .  And, depressed by\nthis saddest of human experiences, . . .he turns away impatient from\nthe promise of more and better, to demand from God the same--\nthe very same.  Browning with magnificent assurance answers,\n‘yes, you shall have the same’.\n\n     “‘Fool! all that is at all,\n     Lasts ever, past recall.’\n\n     “‘Ay, what was, shall be.’\n\n“. . .the ineffable Name which built the palace of King Solomon,\nwhich builds houses not made with hands--houses of flesh\nwhich souls inhabit, craving for a heart and a love to fill them,\ncan and will satisfy their longings; . . .I know no other words\nin the English language which compresses into small compass\nsuch a body of high and inclusive thought as verse nine.\n(1)  God the sole changeless, to whom we turn with passionate desire\nas the one abiding-place, as we find how all things suffer loss\nand change, ourselves, alas! the greatest.  (2)  His power and love\nable and willing to satisfy the hearts of His creatures--\nthe thought expatiated on by St. Augustine and George Herbert\nhere crystallized in one line:--‘Doubt that Thy power can fill the\nheart that Thy power expands?’  (3)  Then the magnificent declaration,\n‘There shall never be one lost good’--the eternal nature of goodness,\nwhile its opposite evil. . .is a non-essential which shall one day\npass away entirely, and be swallowed up of good. . . .\n\n“Now follows an announcement, as by tongue of prophet or seer,\nthat we shall at last find all our ideals complete in the mind of God,\nnot put forth timorously, but with triumphant knowledge--\nknowledge gained by music whose creative power has for the moment\nrevealed to us the permanent existence of these ideals.\n\n“The sorrow and pain and failure which we are all called upon\nto suffer here, . . .are seen to be proofs and evidences of\nthis great belief.  Without the discords how should we learn\nto prize the harmony?\n\n“Carried on the wings of music and high thought, we have ascended one\nof those Delectable mountains--Pisgah-peaks from which\n\n     “‘Our souls have sight of that immortal sea\n     Which brought us hither’;\n\nand whence we can descry, however faintly, the land that is very far off\nto which we travel, and we would fain linger, nay, abide, on the mount,\nbuilding there our tabernacles.\n\n“But it cannot be.  That fine air is difficult to breathe long,\nand life, with its rounds of custom and duty, recalls us.\nSo we descend with the musician, through varying harmonies\nand sliding modulations. . .deadening the poignancy of the minor third\nin the more satisfying reassuring chord of the dominant ninth,\nwhich again finds its rest on the key-note--C major--\nthe common chord, so sober and uninteresting that it well symbolizes\nthe common level of life, the prosaic key-note to which unfortunately\nmost of our lives are set.\n\n“We return, however, strengthened and refreshed, braced to endure\nthe wrongs which we know shall be one day righted, to acquiesce\nin the limited and imperfect conditions of earth, which we know\nshall be merged at last in heaven’s perfect round, and to accept\nwith patience the renunciation demanded of us here, knowing\n\n     “‘All we have willed, or hoped, or dreamed of good shall exist.’”\n\n\nIn his ‘Introductory Address to the Browning Society’,\nthe Rev. J. Kirkman, of Queen’s College, Cambridge, says of\n‘Abt Volger’:--\n\n\n“The spiritual transcendentalism of music, the inscrutable relation\nbetween the seen and the eternal, of which music alone unlocks the gate\nby inarticulate expression, has never had an articulate utterance\nfrom a poet before ‘Abt Vogler’.  This is of a higher order\nof composition, quite nobler, than the merely fretful rebellion\nagainst the earthly condition imposed here below upon heavenly things,\nseen in ‘Master Hughes’ {of Saxe-Gotha}.  In that and other places,\nI am not sure that persons of musical ATTAINMENT,\nas distinguished from musical SOUL AND SYMPATHY, do not rather find\na professional gratification at the technicalities. . .than get\nconducted to ‘the law within the law’.  But in ‘Abt Vogler’,\nthe understanding is spell-bound, and carried on the wings\nof the emotions, as Ganymede in the soft down of the eagle,\ninto the world of spirit. . . .\n\n“The beautiful utterances of Richter alone approach to the value\nof Browning’s on music.  Well does he deserve remembrance for the remark,\nthat ‘Music is the only language incapable of expressing anything impure’,\nand for many others.  They all {the poets quoted in the passage\nomitted above}, comparatively, speak FROM OUTSIDE;\nBrowning speaks FROM INSIDE, as if an angel came to give all the hints\nwe could receive,\n\n     “‘Of that imperial palace when we came.’\n\nHe speaks of music as Dante does of Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory,\nbecause he has been there.  Even the musical Milton,\nwhose best line is, ‘In linked sweetness long drawn out’,\nwhose best special treatment of music is in the occasional poem,\n‘At a solemn music’, has given us nothing of the nature of\n‘Abt Vogler’.  It should be perfectly learnt by heart;\nand it will be ever whispering analogies to the soul in daily life.\nBecause, of course, the mystery of life and the mystery of music\nmake one of the most fundamental transcendental harmonies\nbreathed into our being.”\n\n\n\n\n‘Touch him ne’er so lightly’, etc.\n\n\nIn the first stanza some one describes admiringly a writer\nof mushroom poems.  In the second stanza another gives the genesis\nof a poem which becomes a nation’s heritage.\n\n\n\n\nMemorabilia.\n\n\nThe speaker is one to whom Shelley is an almost ideal being.\nHe can hardly think of him as a man of flesh and blood.\nHe meets some one who has actually seen him and talked with him;\nand it’s all so strange to him, and he expresses so much surprise\nat it, that it moves the laughter of the other, and he breaks off\nand speaks of crossing a moor.  Only a hand’s breadth of it\nshines alone ‘mid the blank miles round about; for there he picked up,\nand put inside his breast, a moulted feather, an eagle-feather.\nHe forgets the rest.  There is, in fact, nothing more for him\nto remember.  The eagle-feather causes an isolated flash\nof association with the poet of the atmosphere, the winds,\nand the clouds,\n\n     “The meteoric poet of air and sea.”\n\n\n\n\nHow it strikes a Contemporary.\n\n\nThe speaker, a Spaniard, it must be supposed, describes to his companion\nthe only poet he knew in his life, who roamed along the promenades\nand through the by-streets and lanes and alleys of Valladolid,\nan old dog, bald and blindish, at his heels.  He appeared interested\nin whatever he looked on, and his looks went everywhere,\ntaking in the cobbler at his trade, the man slicing lemons into drink,\nthe coffee-roaster’s brazier, and the boys turning its winch;\nbooks on stalls, strung-up fly-leaf ballads, posters by the wall;\n\n     “‘If any beat a horse, you felt he saw;\n     If any cursed a woman, he took note.’\n     Yet stared at nobody,--you stared at him,\n     And found, less to your pleasure than surprise,\n     He seemed to know you, and expect as much.”\n\nPopular imagination is active as to who and what he is; perhaps a spy,\nor it may be “a recording chief-inquisitor, the town’s true master\nif the town but knew”, who by letters keeps “our Lord the King”\n well informed “of all thought, said, and acted”; but of the King’s\napproval of these letters there has been no evidence of any kind.\n\nThe speaker found no truth in one of the popular reports, namely,\nthat this strange man lived in great luxury and splendor.\nOn the contrary, he lived in the plainest, simplest manner;\nplayed a game of cribbage with his maid, in the evening, and,\nwhen the church clock struck ten, went straight off to bed.\nIt seems that while the belief of the people was, that this man\nkept up a correspondence with their earthly Lord, the King,\nnoting all that went on, the speaker, in the monologue is aware\nthat it was the Heavenly King with whom he corresponded.\nIn the last paragraph of his monologue he expresses the wish\nthat he might have looked in, yet had haply been afraid,\nwhen this man came to die, and seen, ministering to him,\nthe heavenly attendants,--\n\n               “who line the clean gay garret sides,\n     And stood about the neat low truckle-bed\n     With the heavenly manner of relieving guard.\n     Here had been, mark, the general-in-chief,\n     Thro’ a whole campaign of the world’s life and death,\n     Doing the King’s work all the dim day long,\n          *    *    *    *    *\n     And, now the day was won, relieved at once!”\n\nHe then adds that there was\n\n     “‘No further show or need of that old coat,\n     You are sure, for one thing!  Bless us, all the while\n     How sprucely WE are dressed out, you and I!’”\n\nwe who are so inferior to that divine poet; but,\n\n     “A second, and the angels alter that.”\n\n\n\n\n“Transcendentalism”.\n\n     A poem in twelve books.\n\n\nThis monologue is addressed by a poet to a brother-poet whom\nhe finds fault with for speaking naked thoughts instead of\ndraping them in sights and sounds.  If boys want images and melody,\ngrown men, you think, want abstract thought.  Far from it.\nThe objects which throng our youth, we see and hear, quite as a matter\nof course.  But what of it, if you could tell what they mean?\nThe German Boehme, with his affinities for the abstract,\nnever cared for plants until, one day, he noticed they could speak;\nthat the daisy colloquized with the cowslip on SUCH themes!\nthemes found extant in Jacob’s prose.  But when life’s summer passes\nwhile reading prose in that tough book he wrote, getting some sense\nor other out of it, who helps, then, to repair our loss?\nAnother Boehme, say you, with a tougher book and subtler\nabstract meanings of what roses say?  Or some stout Mage like\nJohn of Halberstadt, who MADE THINGS Boehme WROTE THOUGHTS about?\nAh, John’s the man for us! who instead of giving us the wise talk\nof roses, scatters all around us the roses themselves,\npouring heaven into this shut house of life.  So come,\nthe harp back to your heart again, instead of speaking dry words\nacross its strings.  Your own boy-face bent over the finer chords,\nand following the cherub at the top that points to God\nwith his paired half-moon wings, is a far better poem than your poem\nwith all its naked thoughts.\n\n\n\n\nApparent Failure.\n\n\nThe poet, it appears, speaks here in his own person.\nSauntering about Paris, he comes upon the Doric little Morgue,\nthe dead-house, where they show their drowned.  He enters,\nand sees through the screen of glass, the bodies of three men\nwho committed suicide, the day before, by drowning themselves in the Seine.\n\nIn the last stanza, he gives expression to his hopeful philosophy,\nwhich recognizes “some soul of goodness, in things evil”; *\nwhich sees in human nature, “potentiality of final deliverance\nfrom the evil in it, given only time enough for the work”.\nIn this age of professed and often, no doubt, affected,\nagnosticism and pessimism, Browning is the foremost apostle of Hope.\nHe, more than any other great author of the age, whether philosopher,\nor poet, or divine, has been inspired with the faith that\n\n               “a sun will pierce\n     The thickest cloud earth ever stretched;\n     That, after Last, returns the First,\n     Though a wide compass round be fetched;\n     That what began best, can’t end worst,\n     Nor what God blessed once, prove accurst.”\n\n    --\n     * ‘Henry V.’, IV. 1. 4.\n    --\n\nCompare with this, the following stanzas from Tennyson’s ‘In Memoriam’,\nSection 54:--\n\n     “Oh yet we trust that somehow good\n     Will be the final goal of ill,\n     To pangs of nature, sins of will,\n     Defects of doubt, and taints of blood.\n\n     That nothing walks with aimless feet;\n     That not one life shall be destroyed,\n     Or cast as rubbish to the void,\n     When God hath made the pile complete.\n\n          *    *    *    *    *\n\n     Behold, we know not anything;\n     I can but trust that good shall fall\n     At last--far off--at last, to all,\n     And every winter change to spring.”\n\n\n\n\nRabbi Ben Ezra.\n\n\nAccompany me, my young friend, in my survey of life from youth\nto old age.\n\nThe present life does not rise to its best and then decline\nto its worst; “the best is yet to be, the last of life,\nfor which the first was made.”\n\nThe indecisions, perplexities, and yearnings, the hopes and fears\nof youth, I do not remonstrate against.  They are the conditions\nof vitality and growth, distinguish man’s life from\nthe limited completeness of the “low kinds” of creation,\n“finished and finite clods untroubled by a spark”; and should be prized\nas inseparable from his high rank in existence.\n\nLife would have nothing to boast of, were man formed but to experience\nan unalloyed joy, to find always and never to seek.  Care irks not\nthe crop-full bird, and doubt frets not the maw-crammed beast.\nBut man is disturbed by a divine spark which is his title to\na nearer relationship with God who gives than with his creatures\nthat receive.\n\nThe rebuffs he meets with should be welcomed.  Life’s true success\nis secured through obstacles, and seeming failures,\nand unfulfilled aspirations.  He is but a brute whose soul is conformed\nto his flesh, whose spirit works for the play of arms and legs.\nThe test of the body’s worth should be, the extent to which\nit can project the soul on its lone way.\n\nBut we must not calculate soul-profits all the time.\nGifts of every kind which belong to our nature should prove their use,\ntheir own good in themselves.  I own that the past was for me\nprofuse of power on every side, of perfection at every turn,\nwhich my eyes and ears took in, and my brain treasured up.\nThe heart should beat in harmony with this life, and feel how good\nit is to live and learn, and see the whole design.  I who once\nsaw only Power, now see Love perfect also, and am thankful that I\nwas a man, and trust what my Maker will do with me.\n\nThis flesh is pleasant, and the soul can repose in it,\nafter its own activities.  It is the solid land to which it can return\nwhen wearied with its flights; and we often wish, in our yearnings\nfor rest, that we might hold some prize to match those manifold\npossessions of the brute, might gain most as we should do best;\nbut the realization of such a wish is not compatible with the dignity\nof our nature.\n\nFlesh and soul must be mutually subservient; one must not be\nmerely subjected to the other, not even the inferior to the superior.\nLet us cry, “All good things are ours, nor soul helps flesh more, now,\nthan flesh helps soul.”\n\nLet, then, youth enter into its heritage, and use and enjoy it;\nlet it then pass into an approved manhood, “for aye removed from\nthe developed brute; a God, though in the germ”; let it pass\nfearless and unperplexed as to what weapons to select,\nwhat armor to indue for the battle which awaits that approved manhood.\n\nYouth ended, let what it has resulted in, be taken account of;\nwherein it succeeded, wherein it failed; and having proved the past,\nlet it face the future, satisfied in acting to-morrow\nwhat is learned to-day.\n\nAs it was better that youth should awkwardly strive TOWARD making,\nthan repose in what it found made, so is it better that age,\nexempt from strife, should know, than tempt further.  As in youth,\nage was waited for, so in age, wait for death, without fear,\nand with the absolute soul-knowledge which is independent of\nthe reasoning intellect of youth.  It is this absolute soul-knowledge\nwhich severs great minds from small, rather than intellectual power.\n\nHuman judgments differ.  Whom shall my soul believe?\nOne conclusion may, at least, be rested in:  a man’s true success\nmust not be estimated by things done, which had their price\nin the world; but by that which the world’s coarse thumb and finger\nfailed to plumb; by his immature instincts and unsure purposes\nwhich weighed not as his work in the world’s estimation,\nyet went toward making up the main amount of his real worth;\nby thoughts which could not be contained in narrow acts,\nby fancies which would not submit to the bonds of language;\nby all that he strived after and could not attain, by all that was\nignored by men with only finite and realizable aims:  such are\nGod’s standards of his worth.\n\nAll the true acquisitions of the soul, all the reflected results\nof its energizing after the unattainable in this life,\nall that has truly BEEN, belong to the absolute, and are permanent\namid all earth’s changes.  It is, indeed, through these changes,\nthrough the dance of plastic circumstance, that the permanent\nis secured.  They are the machinery, the Divine Potter’s wheel,\nwhich gives the soul its bent, tries it, and turns it forth\na cup for the Master’s lips, sufficiently impressed.\n\n     “So take and use Thy work!\n     Amend what flaws may lurk,\n     What strain o’ the stuff, what warpings past the aim!\n     My times be in Thy hand!\n     Perfect the cup as planned!\n     Let age approve of youth, and death complete the same.”\n\nThe following account of Rabbi Ben Ezra, I take from\nDr. F. J. Furnivall’s ‘Bibliography of Rober Browning’\n(‘Browning Soc. Papers’, Part II., p. 162):--\n\n\n“Rabbi Ben Ezra, or Ibn Ezra, was a learned Jew, 1092-1167 A.D.\nIbn Ezra and Maimonides, whom he is said to have visited in Egypt,\nwere two of the four great Philosophers or Lights of the Jews\nin the Middle Ages.  Ibn Ezra was born at Toledo in Spain,\nabout 1092 or 1093 A.D., or in 1088 according to Graetz,\n‘Geschichte der Juden’, vi. 198.  He was poor, but studied hard,\ncomposed poems wherewith to ‘Adorn my own, my Hebrew nation’,\nmarried, had a son Isaac (a poet too), travelled to Africa,\nthe Holy Land, Rome in 1140, Persia, India, Italy, France, England.\nHe wrote many treatises on Hebrew Grammar, astronomy, mathematics,\n&c., commentaries on the books of the Bible, &c.--many of them\nin Rome--and two pamphlets in England ‘for a certain Salomon\nof London’.  Joseph of Maudeville was one of his English pupils.\nHe died in 1167, at the age of 75, either in Kalahorra,\non the frontier of Navarre, or in Rome.  His commentary on Isaiah\nhas been englished by M. Friedlaender, and published by\nthe Society of Hebrew Literature, Truebner, 1873.\nFrom the Introduction to that book I take these details.\nIbn Ezra believed in a future life.  In his commentary on Isaiah 55:3,\n‘AND YOUR SOUL SHALL LIVE’, he says, ‘That is, your soul shall live\nforever after the death of the body, or you will receive new life\nthrough Messiah, when you will return to the Divine Law.’\nSee also on Isaiah 39:18.  Of the potter’s clay passage, Isaiah 29:16,\nhe has only a translation, ‘Shall man be esteemed as the potter’s clay’,\nand no comment that could ever have given Browning a hint\nfor his use of the metaphor in his poem, even if he had ever seen\nIbn Ezra’s commentary.  See Rabbi Ben Ezra’s fine ‘Song of Death’\nin stanzas 12-20 of the grimly humorous Holy-Cross Day.”\n\n\n\n\nA Grammarian’s Funeral.\n\n    --\n     * “Grammarian” mustn’t be understood here in its restricted\n     modern sense; it means rather one devoted to learning, or\n     letters, in general.\n    --\n\n     Shortly after the revival of learning in Europe.\n\n\nThe devoted disciples of a dead grammarian are bearing his body up\na mountain-side for burial on its lofty summit, “where meteors shoot,\nclouds form, lightnings are loosened, stars come and go!\nLofty designs must close in like effects:  loftily lying, leave him,--\nstill loftier than the world suspects, living and dying”.\n\nThis poem is INFORMED throughout with the poet’s iterated doctrine\nin regard to earth life,--to the relativity of that life.\nThe grammarian, in his hunger and thirst after knowledge and truth,\nthought not of time.  “What’s time?  Leave Now for dogs and apes!\nMan has Forever.”  “Oh, if we draw a circle premature,\nheedless of far gain, greedy for quick returns of profit,\nsure bad is our bargain!”\n\nThe poem “exhibits something of the life of the Scaligers and\nthe Casaubons, of many an early scholar, like Roger Bacon’s friend,\nPierre de Maricourt, working at some region of knowledge,\nand content to labor without fame so long as he mastered thoroughly\nwhatever he undertook” (‘Contemporary Rev.’, iv., 135).\n\nBut the grammarian was true to one side only of Browning’s\nphilosophy of life.  He disregarded the claims of the physical life,\nand became “soul-hydropic with a sacred thirst”. *\n\n    --\n     * “Every lust is a kind of hydropic distemper, and the more\n     we drink the more we shall thirst.”--Tillotson, quoted in\n     ‘Webster’.\n    --\n\nThe lyrico-dramatic verse of this monologue is especially noticeable.\nThere is a march in it, exhibiting the spirit with which the bearers\nof the corpse are conveying it up the mountain-side.\n\n\n\n\nAn Epistle containing the Strange Medical Experience of Karshish, the Arab Physician.\n\n\nKarshish, the Arab physician, has been journeying in quest of knowledge\npertaining to his art, and writes to his all-sagacious master, Abib,\nostensibly about the specimens he has gathered of medicinal plants\nand minerals, and the observations he has made; but his real interest,\nwhich he endeavors to conceal by passing to matters of\ngreater import to him, as he would have his sage at home believe,\nis in what he pronounces “a case of mania, subinduced by epilepsy”.\nHis last letter brought his journeyings to Jericho.  He is now on his\nway to Jerusalem, and has reached Bethany, where he passes the night.\n\nThe case of mania which so interests him,--far more than he is\nwilling to admit,--is that of Lazarus, whose firm conviction rests\nthat he was dead (in fact they buried him) and then restored to life\nby a Nazarene physician of his tribe, who afterwards perished\nin a tumult.  The man Lazarus is witless, he writes, of the relative\nvalue of all things.  Vast armaments assembled to besiege his city,\nand the passing of a mule with gourds, are all one to him;\nwhile at some trifling fact, he’ll gaze, rapt with stupor,\nas if it had for him prodigious import.  Should his child sicken\nunto death, why look for scarce abatement of his cheerfulness,\nor suspension of his daily craft; while a word, gesture, or glance\nfrom that same child at play or laid asleep, will start him to\nan agony of fear, exasperation, just as like!  The law of the life,\nit seems, to which he was temporarily admitted, has become to him\nthe law of this earthly life; his heart and brain move there,\nhis feet stay here.  He appears to be perfectly submissive\nto the heavenly will, and awaits patiently for death to restore\nhis being to equilibrium.  He is by no means apathetic,\nbut loves both old and young, affects the very brutes and birds\nand flowers of the field.  This man, so restored to life,\nregards his restorer as, who but God himself, Creator and Sustainer\nof the world, that came and dwelt in flesh on it awhile, taught,\nhealed the sick, broke bread at his own house, then died!\nHere Karshish breaks off and asks pardon for writing of such\ntrivial matters, when there are so important ones to treat of,\nand states that he noticed on the margin of a pool blue-flowering\nborage abounding, the Aleppo sort, very nitrous.  But he returns again\nto the subject, and tries to explain the peculiar interest, and awe,\nindeed, the man has inspired him with.  Perhaps the journey’s end,\nand his weariness, he thinks, may have had something to do with it.\nHe then relates the weird circumstances under which he met him,\nand concludes by saying that the repose he will have at Jerusalem\nshall make amends for the time his letter wastes, his master’s\nand his own.  Till when, once more thy pardon and farewell!\n\nBut in spite of himself, his suppressed interest in the strange case\nMUST have full expression, and he gives way to all reserve\nand ejaculates in a postscript:--\n\n     “The very God! think, Abib; dost thou think?\n     So, the All-Great, were the All-Loving too--\n     So, through the thunder comes a human voice\n     Saying, ‘O heart I made, a heart beats here!\n     Face, my hands fashioned, see it in myself.\n     Thou hast no power nor may’st conceive of mine,\n     But love I gave thee, with myself to love,\n     And thou must love me who have died for thee!’\n     The madman saith He said so:  it is strange.”\n\nSee before, p. 41 {about one-fifth into Part II of the Introduction},\nsome remarks on the psychological phase of the monologue.\n\n\n“The monologue is a signal example of ‘emotional ratiocination’.\nThere is a flash of ecstasy through the strangely cautious description\nof Karshish; every syllable is weighed and thoughtful,\neverywhere the lines swell into perfect feeling.”--Robert Buchanan.\n\n“As an example of our poet’s dramatic power in getting right at\nthe heart of a man, reading what is there written, and then looking\nthrough his eyes and revealing it all in the man’s own speech,\nnothing can be more complete in its inner soundings and outer-keeping,\nthan the epistle containing the ‘Strange Medical Experience\nof Karshish, the Arab Physician’, who has been picking up\nthe crumbs of learning on his travels in the Holy Land,\nand writes to Abib, the all-sagacious, at home.  It is so solemnly real\nand so sagely fine.”--N. Brit. Rev., May, 1861.\n\n\n\n\nA Martyr’s Epitaph.\n\n\nA wonderfully effective expression, effective through\nits pathetic simplicity, of the peaceful spirit of a Christian,\nwho has triumphed over persecution and death, and passed to his reward.\n\n\n\n\nSoliloquy of the Spanish Cloister.\n\n\nThe speaker in this monologue is a Spanish monk, whose jealousy toward\na simple and unoffending brother has, in the seclusion of the cloister,\ndeveloped into a festering malignity.  If hate, he says,\ncould kill a man, his hate would certainly kill Brother Laurence.\nHe is watching this brother, from a window of the cloister,\nat work in the garden.  He looks with contempt upon his honest toil;\nrepeats mockingly to himself, his simple talk when at meals,\nabout the weather and the crops; sneers at his neatness,\nand orderliness, and cleanliness; imputes to him his own libidinousness.\nHe takes credit to himself in laying crosswise, in Jesu’s praise,\nhis knife and fork, after refection, and in illustrating the Trinity,\nand frustrating the Arian, by drinking his watered orange-pulp\nin three sips, while Laurence drains his at one gulp.  Now he notices\nLaurence’s tender care of the melons, of which it appears the good man\nhas promised all the brethren a feast; “so nice!”  He calls to him,\nfrom the window, “How go on your flowers?  None double?\nNot one fruit-sort can you spy?”  Laurence, it must be understood,\nkindly answers him in the negative, and then he chuckles to himself,\n“Strange!--and I, too, at such trouble, keep ‘em close-nipped\non the sly!”  He thinks of devising means of causing him to trip on\na great text in Galatians, entailing “twenty-nine distinct damnations,\none sure, if another fails”; or of slyly putting his\n“scrofulous French novel” in his way, which will make him\n“grovel hand and foot in Belial’s gripe”.  In his malignity,\nhe is ready to pledge his soul to Satan (leaving a flaw\nin the indenture), to see blasted that rose-acacia Laurence is\nso proud of.  Here the vesper-bell interrupts his filthy\nand blasphemous eructations, and he turns up his eyes and folds his\nhands on his breast, mumbling “Plena gratia ave Virgo!”\n and right upon the prayer, his disgust breaks out, “Gr-r-r--you swine!”\n\nThis monologue affords a signal illustration of the poet’s skill\nin making a speaker, while directly revealing his own character,\nreflect very distinctly the character of another.  This has been seen\nin ‘My Last Duchess’, given as an example of the constitution\nof this art-form, in the section of the Introduction on\n‘Browning’s Obscurity’.\n\n\n“The ‘Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister’, is a picture\n(ghastly in its evident truth) of superstition which has survived religion;\nof a heart which has abandoned the love of kindred and friends,\nonly to lose itself in a wilderness of petty spite, terminating in an abyss\nof diabolical hatred.  The ordinary providential helps to goodness\nhave been rejected; the ill-provided adventurer has sought to scale\nthe high snow-peaks of saintliness,--he has missed his footing,--\nand the black chasm which yawns beneath, has ingulfed him.”\n --E. J. H{asell}, in St. Paul’s Magazine, December, 1870.\n\n\nAn able writer in ‘The Contemporary Review’, Vol. IV., p. 140,\njustly remarks:--\n\n“No living writer--and we do not know any one in the past who\ncan be named, in this respect, in the same breath with him {Browning}\n--approaches his power of analyzing and reproducing the morbid forms,\nthe corrupt semblances, the hypocrisies, formalisms, and fanaticisms of\nman’s religious life.  The wildness of an Antinomian predestinarianism\nhas never been so grandly painted as in ‘Johannes Agricola\nin Meditation’; the white heat of the persecutor glares on us,\nlike a nightmare spectre, in ‘The Heretic’s Tragedy’.\nMore subtle forms are drawn with greater elaboration.\nIf ‘Bishop Blougram’s Apology’, in many of its circumstances\nand touches, suggests the thought of actual portraiture,\nrecalling a form and face once familiar to us, . . .it is also\na picture of a class of minds which we meet with everywhere.\nConservative scepticism that persuades itself that it believes,\ncynical acuteness in discerning the weak points either\nof mere secularism or dreaming mysticism, or passionate eagerness\nto reform, avoiding dangerous extremes, and taking things as they are\nbecause they are comfortable, and lead to wealth, enjoyment,\nreputation,--this, whether a true account or not of the theologian\nto whom we have referred. . .is yet to be found under many\neloquent defences of the faith, many fervent and scornful denunciations\nof criticism and free thought. . . .  In ‘Calaban upon Setebos’,\nif it is more than the product of Mr. Browning’s fondness for\nall abnormal forms of spiritual life, speculating among other things\non the religious thoughts of a half brute-like savage, we must see\na protest against the thought that man can rise by himself\nto true thoughts of God, and develop a pure theology out of\nhis moral consciousness.  So far it is a witness for the necessity\nof a revelation, either through the immediate action of the Light\nthat lighteth every man, or that which has been given to mankind\nin spoken or written words, by The WORD that was in the beginning.\nIn the ‘Death in the Desert’, in like manner, we have another\nschool of thought analyzed with a corresponding subtlety. . . .\nThe ‘Death in the Dessert’ is worth studying in its bearing upon\nthe mythical school of interpretation, and as a protest,\nwe would fain hope, from Mr. Browning’s own mind against the thought\nthat because the love of God has been revealed in Christ,\nand has taught us the greatness of all true human love, therefore,\n\n     “‘We ourselves make the love, and Christ was not.’\n\n“In one remarkable passage at the close of ‘The Legend of Pornic’,\nMr. Browning, speaking apparently in his own person,\nproclaims his belief in one great Christian doctrine,\nwhich all pantheistic and atheistic systems formally repudiate,\nand which many semi-Christian thinkers implicitly reject:--\n\n     “‘The candid incline to surmise of late\n     That the Christian faith may be false, I find,\n     For our ‘Essays and Reviews’ *1* debate\n     Begins to tell on the public mind,\n     And Colenso’s*2* words have weight.\n\n     “‘I still, to suppose it true, for my part,\n     See reasons and reasons:  this, to begin--\n     ‘Tis the faith that launched point-blank her dart\n     At the head of a lie,--taught Original Sin,\n     The Corruption of Man’s Heart.’”\n\n    --\n     *1* A volume which appeared in 1860, made up of essays and\n     reviews, the several authors having “written in entire\n     independence of each other, and without concert or\n     comparison”.  These essays and reviews offset the extreme\n     high church doctrine of the Tracts for the Times.\n\n     *2* John W. Colenso, Bishop of Natal, in South Africa; he\n     published works questioning the inspiration and historical\n     accuracy of certain parts of the Bible, among which was ‘The\n     Pentateuch, and the Book of Joshua critically examined’.\n    --\n\n\n\n\nHoly-Cross Day.\n\nOn which the Jews were forced to attend an annual Christian sermon\nin Rome.\n\n\nThe argument is sufficiently shown by what is prefixed to this poem.\nThe ‘Diary by the Bishop’s Secretary, 1600’, is presumably imaginary.\n\n\n\n\nSaul.\n\n\nThis is, in every respect, one of Browning’s grandest poems; and in all\nthat is included in the idea of EXPRESSION, is quite perfect.\n\nThe portion of Scripture which is the germ of the poem,\nand it is only the germ, is contained in the First Book of Samuel 16:14-23.\n\nTo the present consolation which David administers to Saul,\nwith harp and song, and the Scripture story does not go beyond this,\nis added the assurance of the transmission of his personality,\nand of the influence of his deeds; first, through those who have been\nquickened by them, and who will, in turn, transmit that quickening--\n“Each deed thou hast done, dies, revives, goes to work in the world:\n. . .each ray of thy will, every flash of thy passion and prowess,\nlong over, shall thrill thy whole people, the countless, with ardor,\ntill they too give forth a like cheer to their sons:  who, in turn,\nfill the South and the North with the radiance thy deed was the germ of”;\nand, then, through records that will give unborn generations their due\nand their part in his being.\n\nThe consolation is, moreover, carried beyond that afforded by\nearthly fame and influence.  David’s yearnings to give Saul\n“new life altogether, as good, ages hence, as this moment,--\nhad love but the warrant, love’s heart to dispense”, pass into\na prophecy, based on his own loving desires, of the God-Man\nwho shall throw open to Saul the gates of that new life.\n\nWith this prophecy, David leaves Saul.  On his way home, in the night,\nhe represents himself as attended by witnesses, cohorts to left\nand to right.  At the dawn, all nature, the forests, the wind,\nbeasts and birds, even the serpent that slid away silent,\nappear to him aware of the new law; the little brooks, witnessing,\nmurmured with all but hushed voices, “E’en so, it is so!”\n\n\n\n\nA Death in the Desert.\n\n\n‘A Death in the Desert’ appears to have been inspired by\nthe controversies in regard to the historical foundations\nof Christianity, and, more especially, in regard to the character\nand the authorship of the Fourth Gospel--controversies which\nreceived their first great impulse from the ‘Leben Jesu’\nof David Friedrich Strauss, first published in 1835.\nAn English translation of the fourth edition, 1840, by Marian Evans\n(George Eliot), was published in London, in 1846.\n\nThe immediate occasion of the composition of ‘A Death in the Desert’\nwas, perhaps, the publication, in 1863, of Joseph Ernest Renan’s\n‘Vie de Jesus’.  ‘A Death in the Desert’ was included in the poet’s\n‘Dramatis Personae’, published in the following year.\n\n“In style, the poem a little recalls ‘Cleon’; with less of\nharmonious grace and clear classic outline, it possesses\na certain stilled sweetness, a meditative tenderness,\nall its own, and beautifully appropriate to the utterance\nof the ‘beloved disciple’.”--Arthur Symons.\n\nDuring a persecution of the Christians, the aged John of Patmos\nhas been secretly conveyed, by some faithful disciples,\nto a cave in the desert, where he is dying.  Revived temporarily\nby the tender ministrations of his disciples, he is enabled\nto tell over his past labors in the service of his beloved Master,\nto refute the Antichrist already in the world, and to answer\nthe questions which, with his far-reaching spiritual vision,\nhe foresees will be raised in regard to Christ’s nature, life,\ndoctrine, and miracles, as recorded in the Gospel he has written.\nThese services he feels to be due from him, in his dying hour,\nas the sole survivor of Christ’s apostles and intimate companions.\n\nThis is the only composition in which Browning deals directly\nwith historical Christianity; and its main purpose may, in brief,\nbe said to be, to set forth the absoluteness of Christianity,\nwhich cannot be affected by any assaults made upon its external,\nhistorical character.\n\nThe doctrine of the trinal unity of man (the what Does, what Knows,\nwhat Is) ascribed to John (vv. 82-104), and upon which his discourse\nmay be said to proceed, leads up the presentation of the final stage\nof the Christian life on earth--that stage when man has won his way\nto the kingdom of the “what Is” within himself, and when he\nno longer needs the outward supports to his faith which he needed\nbefore he passed from the “what Knows”.  Christianity is a religion\nwhich is only secondarily a doctrine addressed to the “what Knows”.\nIt is, first of all, a religion whose fountain-head is a Personality\nin whom all that is spiritually potential in man, was realized,\nand in responding to whom the soul of man is quickened and regenerated.\nAnd the Church, through the centuries, has been kept alive,\nnot by the letter of the New Testament, for the letter killeth,\nbut by a succession of quickened and regenerated spirits,\n“the noble Living and the noble Dead”, through whom the Christ\nhas been awakened and developed in other souls.\n\n\n\n\n\nPOEMS.\n\n\n\n\nWanting is--What?\n\n\n\n  Wanting is--what?\n  Summer redundant,\n  Blueness abundant,\n--Where is the spot?\n  Beamy the world, yet a blank all the same,          {5}\n--Framework which waits for a picture to frame:\n  What of the leafage, what of the flower?\n  Roses embowering with nought they embower!\n  Come then, complete incompletion, O Comer,\n  Pant through the blueness, perfect the summer!     {10}\n  Breathe but one breath\n  Rose-beauty above,\n  And all that was death\n  Grows life, grows love,\n  Grows love!                                        {15}\n\n\n--\n4.  spot:  defect, imperfection.\n\n9.

Without love, the Christ-spirit, the spirit of\nthe Comer, man sees, at best, only dynamic action, blind force, in\nnature; but\n\n            “love greatens and glorifies\n       Till God’s a-glow, to the loving eyes,\n       In what was mere earth before.”\n                            James Lee’s Wife (Along the Beach).\n--\n\n\n\n\nMy Star.\n\n\n\n     All that I know\n       Of a certain star\n     Is, it can throw\n       (Like the angled spar)\n     Now a dart of red,                                            {5}\n       Now a dart of blue;\n     Till my friends have said\n       They would fain see, too,\n     My star that dartles the red and the blue!\n     Then it stops like a bird; like a flower, hangs furled:      {10}\n       They must solace themselves with the Saturn above it.\n     What matter to me if their star is a world?\n       Mine has opened its soul to me; therefore I love it.\n\n--\n10.  Then it stops like a bird:  it beats no longer with emotion\nresponsive to loving eyes, but stops, as a bird stops its song when\ndisturbed.\n--\n\n\n\nThe Flight of the Duchess.\n\n\n\n       1.\n\n     You’re my friend:\n     I was the man the Duke spoke to;\n     I helped the Duchess to cast off his yoke, too:\n     So, here’s the tale from beginning to end,\n     My friend!                                               {5}\n\n--\n2.

For in Paris they told the elf\n     That our rough North land was the Land of Lays,\n     The one good thing left in evil days;\n     Since the Mid-Age was the Heroic Time,\n     And only in wild nooks like ours\n     Could you taste of it yet as in its prime,\n     And see true castles with proper towers,\n     Young-hearted women, old-minded men,                   {110}\n     And manners now as manners were then.\n     So, all that the old Dukes had been, without knowing it,\n     This Duke would fain know he was, without being it;\n     ‘Twas not for the joy’s self, but the joy of his showing it,\n     Nor for the pride’s self, but the pride of our seeing it,\n     He revived all usages thoroughly worn-out,\n     The souls of them fumed-forth, the hearts of them torn-out:\n     And chief in the chase his neck he perilled,\n     On a lathy horse, all legs and length,\n     With blood for bone, all speed, no strength;           {120}\n   --They should have set him on red Berold\n     With the red eye slow consuming in fire,\n     And the thin stiff ear like an abbey spire!\n\n--\n101.  struck at himself:  astonished at his own importance.\n\n119.  lathy:  long and slim.\n\n\n       6.\n\n     Well, such as he was, he must marry, we heard;\n     And out of a convent, at the word,\n     Came the lady, in time of spring.\n   --Oh, old thoughts they cling, they cling!\n     That day, I know, with a dozen oaths\n     I clad myself in thick hunting-clothes\n     Fit for the chase of urox or buffle               {130}\n     In winter-time when you need to muffle.\n     But the Duke had a mind we should cut a figure,\n     And so we saw the lady arrive:\n     My friend, I have seen a white crane bigger!\n     She was the smallest lady alive,\n     Made in a piece of nature’s madness,\n     Too small, almost, for the life and gladness\n     That over-filled her, as some hive\n     Out of the bears’ reach on the high trees\n     Is crowded with its safe merry bees:              {140}\n     In truth, she was not hard to please!\n     Up she looked, down she looked, round at the mead,\n     Straight at the castle, that’s best indeed\n     To look at from outside the walls:\n     As for us, styled the “serfs and thralls”,\n     She as much thanked me as if she had said it,\n     (With her eyes, do you understand?)\n     Because I patted her horse while I led it;\n     And Max, who rode on her other hand,\n     Said, no bird flew past but she inquired          {150}\n     What its true name was, nor ever seemed tired--\n     If that was an eagle she saw hover,\n     And the green and gray bird on the field was the plover,\n     When suddenly appeared the Duke:\n     And as down she sprung, the small foot pointed\n     On to my hand,--as with a rebuke,\n     And as if his backbone were not jointed,\n     The Duke stepped rather aside than forward,\n     And welcomed her with his grandest smile;\n     And, mind you, his mother all the while           {160}\n     Chilled in the rear, like a wind to nor’ward;\n     And up, like a weary yawn, with its pulleys\n     Went, in a shriek, the rusty portcullis;\n     And, like a glad sky the north-wind sullies,\n     The lady’s face stopped its play,\n     As if her first hair had grown gray;\n     For such things must begin some one day.\n\n--\n130.  urox: wild bull; Ger. ‘auer-ochs’.  buffle:  buffalo.\n\n\n       7.\n\n     In a day or two she was well again;\n     As who should say, “You labor in vain!\n     This is all a jest against God, who meant         {170}\n     I should ever be, as I am, content\n     And glad in his sight; therefore, glad I will be.”\n      So, smiling as at first went she.\n\n\n       8.\n\n     She was active, stirring, all fire--\n     Could not rest, could not tire--\n     To a stone she might have given life!\n     (I myself loved once, in my day)\n   --For a shepherd’s, miner’s, huntsman’s wife,\n     (I had a wife, I know what I say)\n     Never in all the world such an one!

                      {410}\n     And then, as of old, at the end of the humming\n     Her usual presents were forthcoming\n   --A dog-whistle blowing the fiercest of trebles\n     (Just a seashore stone holding a dozen fine pebbles),\n     Or a porcelain mouth-piece to screw on a pipe-end,--\n     And so she awaited her annual stipend.\n     But this time, the Duke would scarcely vouchsafe\n     A word in reply; and in vain she felt\n     With twitching fingers at her belt\n     For the purse of sleek pine-martin pelt,               {420}\n     Ready to put what he gave in her pouch safe,--\n     Till, either to quicken his apprehension,\n     Or possibly with an after-intention,\n     She was come, she said, to pay her duty\n     To the new Duchess, the youthful beauty.\n     No sooner had she named his lady,\n     Than a shine lit up the face so shady,\n     And its smirk returned with a novel meaning--\n     For it struck him, the babe just wanted weaning;\n     If one gave her a taste of what life was and sorrow,   {430}\n     She, foolish to-day, would be wiser to-morrow;\n     And who so fit a teacher of trouble\n     As this sordid crone bent well-nigh double?\n     So, glancing at her wolf-skin vesture\n     (If such it was, for they grow so hirsute\n     That their own fleece serves for natural fur-suit)\n     He was contrasting, ‘twas plain from his gesture,\n     The life of the lady so flower-like and delicate\n     With the loathsome squalor of this helicat.\n     I, in brief, was the man the Duke beckoned             {440}\n     From out of the throng; and while I drew near\n     He told the crone--as I since have reckoned\n     By the way he bent and spoke into her ear\n     With circumspection and mystery--\n     The main of the lady’s history,\n     Her frowardness and ingratitude;\n     And for all the crone’s submissive attitude\n     I could see round her mouth the loose plaits tightening,\n     And her brow with assenting intelligence brightening,\n     As though she engaged with hearty good will            {450}\n     Whatever he now might enjoin to fulfil,\n     And promised the lady a thorough frightening.\n     And so, just giving her a glimpse\n     Of a purse, with the air of a man who imps\n     The wing of the hawk that shall fetch the hernshaw,\n     He bade me take the gypsy mother\n     And set her telling some story or other\n     Of hill and dale, oak-wood or fernshaw,\n     To while away a weary hour\n     For the lady left alone in her bower,                  {460}\n     Whose mind and body craved exertion\n     And yet shrank from all better diversion.\n\n--\n354.

    And back I turned and bade the crone follow.\n     And what makes me confident what’s to be told you\n     Had all along been of this crone’s devising,\n     Is, that, on looking round sharply, behold you,\n     There was a novelty quick as surprising:          {470}\n     For first, she had shot up a full head in stature,\n     And her step kept pace with mine nor faltered,\n     As if age had foregone its usurpature,\n     And the ignoble mien was wholly altered,\n     And the face looked quite of another nature,\n     And the change reached too, whatever the change meant,\n     Her shaggy wolf-skin cloak’s arrangment:\n     For where its tatters hung loose like sedges,\n     Gold coins were glittering on the edges,\n     Like the band-roll strung with tomans             {480}\n     Which proves the veil a Persian woman’s:\n     And under her brow, like a snail’s horns newly\n     Come out as after the rain he paces,\n     Two unmistakable eye-points duly\n     Live and aware looked out of their places.\n     So, we went and found Jacynth at the entry\n     Of the lady’s chamber standing sentry;\n     I told the command and produced my companion,\n     And Jacynth rejoiced to admit any one,\n     For since last night, by the same token,          {490}\n     Not a single word had the lady spoken:\n     They went in both to the presence together,\n     While I in the balcony watched the weather.\n\n--\n463.  curveter:  a leaping horse.\n\n480.  tomans:  Persian coins.\n\n490.  by the same token:  by a presentiment or forewarning of the same.\n\n\n         15.\n\n     And now, what took place at the very first of all,\n     I cannot tell, as I never could learn it:\n     Jacynth constantly wished a curse to fall\n     On that little head of hers and burn it\n     If she knew how she came to drop so soundly\n     Asleep of a sudden, and there continue\n     The whole time, sleeping as profoundly            {500}\n     As one of the boars my father would pin you\n     ‘Twixt the eyes where life holds garrison,\n   --Jacynth, forgive me the comparison!\n     But where I begin my own narration\n     Is a little after I took my station\n     To breathe the fresh air from the balcony,\n     And, having in those days a falcon eye,\n     To follow the hunt through the open country,\n     From where the bushes thinlier crested\n     The hillocks, to a plain where’s not one tree.    {510}\n     When, in a moment, my ear was arrested\n     By--was it singing, or was it saying,\n     Or a strange musical instrument playing\n     In the chamber?--and to be certain\n     I pushed the lattice, pulled the curtain,\n     And there lay Jacynth asleep,\n     Yet as if a watch she tried to keep,\n     In a rosy sleep along the floor\n     With her head against the door;\n     While in the midst, on the seat of state,         {520}\n     Was a queen--the gypsy woman late,\n     With head and face downbent\n     On the lady’s head and face intent:\n     For, coiled at her feet like a child at ease,\n     The lady sat between her knees,\n     And o’er them the lady’s clasped hands met,\n     And on those hands her chin was set,\n     And her upturned face met the face of the crone\n     Wherein the eyes had grown and grown\n     As if she could double and quadruple              {530}\n     At pleasure the play of either pupil\n   --Very like, by her hands’ slow fanning,\n     As up and down like a gor-crow’s flappers\n     They moved to measure, or bell-clappers.\n     I said, “Is it blessing, is it banning,\n     Do they applaud you or burlesque you--\n     Those hands and fingers with no flesh on?”\n      But, just as I thought to spring in to the rescue,\n     At once I was stopped by the lady’s expression:\n     For it was life her eyes were drinking            {540}\n     From the crone’s wide pair above unwinking,\n   --Life’s pure fire, received without shrinking,\n     Into the heart and breast whose heaving\n     Told you no single drop they were leaving,\n   --Life that, filling her, passed redundant\n     Into her very hair, back swerving\n     Over each shoulder, loose and abundant,\n     As her head thrown back showed the white throat curving;\n     And the very tresses shared in the pleasure,\n     Moving to the mystic measure,                     {550}\n     Bounding as the bosom bounded.\n     I stopped short, more and more confounded,\n     As still her cheeks burned and eyes glistened,\n     As she listened and she listened:\n     When all at once a hand detained me,\n     The selfsame contagion gained me,\n     And I kept time to the wondrous chime,\n     Making out words and prose and rhyme,\n     Till it seemed that the music furled\n     Its wings like a task fulfilled, and dropped      {560}\n     From under the words it first had propped,\n     And left them midway in the world,\n     Word took word as hand takes hand,\n     I could hear at last, and understand,\n     And when I held the unbroken thread,\n     The gypsy said:--\n\n     “And so at last we find my tribe.\n     And so I set thee in the midst,\n     And to one and all of them describe\n     What thou saidst and what thou didst,             {570}\n     Our long and terrible journey through,\n     And all thou art ready to say and do\n     In the trials that remain:\n     I trace them the vein and the other vein\n     That meet on thy brow and part again,\n     Making our rapid mystic mark;\n     And I bid my people prove and probe\n     Each eye’s profound and glorious globe,\n     Till they detect the kindred spark\n     In those depths so dear and dark,                 {580}\n     Like the spots that snap and burst and flee,\n     Circling over the midnight sea.\n     And on that round young cheek of thine\n     I make them recognize the tinge,\n     As when of the costly scarlet wine\n     They drip so much as will impinge\n     And spread in a thinnest scale afloat\n     One thick gold drop from the olive’s coat\n     Over a silver plate whose sheen\n     Still through the mixture shall be seen.          {590}\n     For so I prove thee, to one and all,\n     Fit, when my people ope their breast,\n     To see the sign, and hear the call,\n     And take the vow, and stand the test\n     Which adds one more child to the rest--\n     When the breast is bare and the arms are wide,\n     And the world is left outside.\n     For there is probation to decree,\n     And many and long must the trials be\n     Thou shalt victoriously endure,                   {600}\n     If that brow is true and those eyes are sure;\n     Like a jewel-finder’s fierce assay\n     Of the prize he dug from its mountain tomb,--\n     Let once the vindicating ray\n     Leap out amid the anxious gloom,\n     And steel and fire have done their part,\n     And the prize falls on its finder’s heart;\n     So, trial after trial past,\n     Wilt thou fall at the very last\n     Breathless, half in trance                        {610}\n     With the thrill of the great deliverance,\n     Into our arms forevermore;\n     And thou shalt know, those arms once curled\n     About thee, what we knew before,\n     How love is the only good in the world.\n     Henceforth be loved as heart can love,\n     Or brain devise, or hand approve!\n     Stand up, look below,\n     It is our life at thy feet we throw\n     To step with into light and joy;                  {620}\n     Not a power of life but we employ\n     To satisfy thy nature’s want;\n     Art thou the tree that props the plant,\n     Or the climbing plant that seeks the tree--\n     Canst thou help us, must we help thee?\n     If any two creatures grew into one,\n     They would do more than the world has done;\n     Though each apart were never so weak,\n     Ye vainly through the world should seek\n     For the knowledge and the might                   {630}\n     Which in such union grew their right:\n     So, to approach at least that end,\n     And blend,--as much as may be, blend\n     Thee with us or us with thee,--\n     As climbing plant or propping tree,\n     Shall some one deck thee over and down,\n     Up and about, with blossoms and leaves?\n     Fix his heart’s fruit for thy garland crown,\n     Cling with his soul as the gourd-vine cleaves,\n     Die on thy boughs and disappear                   {640}\n     While not a leaf of thine is sere?\n     Or is the other fate in store,\n     And art thou fitted to adore,\n     To give thy wondrous self away,\n     And take a stronger nature’s sway?\n     I foresee and

None can give true sympathy but those who have suffered and learnt\nto love, therefore she must be proved,--‘Fit when my people ope their\nbreast’, etc. (vv. 592-601).  Passing from the bondage she has endured\nshe will still have trials, but the old pain will have no power to touch\nher.  She has learnt all it can teach, and the world will be richer for\nit.

Love at its highest is\nnot yet known to us, but the passionate eyes of the Duchess tell us it\nwill not be a life of quiescence.  Giving herself out freely for the\ngood of all she can never be alone again,--‘We are beside thee in all\nthy ways’. The great company of those who need her, the gypsy band of\nall human claims.  Death to such a life is but ‘the hand that ends a\ndream’. What was to come after not even the Gypsy Queen could tell.”--\nMrs. Owen (‘Browning Soc.

Browning has no moping melancholy lovers.  His lovers generally\nreflect his own manliness; and when their passion is unrequited,\nthey acknowledge the absolute value of love to their own souls.\nAs Mr. James Thomson, in his ‘Notes on the Genius of Robert Browning’,\nremarks (‘B. Soc. Papers’, Part II., p. 246), “Browning’s passion\nis as intense, noble, and manly as his intellect is profound and subtle,\nand therefore original.  I would especially insist on its manliness,\nbecause our present literature abounds in so-called passion\nwhich is but half-sincere or wholly insincere sentimentalism,\nif it be not thinly disguised prurient lust, and in so-called pathos\nwhich is maudlin to nauseousness.  The great unappreciated poet\nlast cited {George Meredith} has defined passion as ‘noble strength\non fire’; and this is the true passion of great natures and great poets;\nwhile sentimentalism is ignoble weakness dallying with fire; . . .\nBrowning’s passion is of utter self-sacrifice, self-annihilation,\nself-vindicated by its irresistible intensity.  So we read it\nin ‘Time’s Revenges’, so in the scornful condemnation of\nthe weak lovers in ‘The Statue and the Bust’, so in ‘In a Balcony’,\nand ‘Two in the Campagna’, with its\n\n     “‘Infinite passion and the pain\n     Of finite hearts that yearn.’\n\nIs the love rejected, unreturned?  No weak and mean upbraidings of\nthe beloved, no futile complaints; a solemn resignation to\nimmitigable Fate; intense gratitude for inspiring love\nto the unloving beloved.  So in ‘A Serenade at the Villa’;\nso in ‘One Way of Love’, with its\n\n     “‘My whole life long I learned to love.\n     This hour my utmost art I prove\n     And speak my passion.--Heaven or Hell?\n     She will not give me Heaven?  ‘Tis well!\n     Lose who may--I still can say,\n     Those who win Heaven, blest are they!’\n\nSo in ‘The Last Ride Together’, with its\n\n     “‘I said--Then, dearest, since ‘tis so,’” etc.\n\n\n       2.\n\n     My mistress bent that brow of hers;\n     Those deep dark eyes where pride demurs\n     When pity would be softening through,\n     Fixed me a breathing-while or two\n       With life or death in the balance:  right!\n     The blood replenished me again;\n     My last thought was at least not vain:\n     I and my mistress, side by side,\n     Shall be together, breathe and ride,\n     So, one day more am I deified.\n       Who knows but the world may end to-night?\n\n\n       3.\n\n     Hush! if you saw some western cloud\n     All billowy-bosomed, over-bowed\n     By many benedictions--sun’s\n     And moon’s and evening-star’s at once--\n       And so, you, looking and loving best,\n     Conscious grew, your passion drew\n     Cloud, sunset, moonrise, star-shine too,\n     Down on you, near and yet more near,\n     Till flesh must fade for heaven was here!--\n     Thus leant she and lingered--joy and fear\n       Thus lay she a moment on my breast.\n\n\n       4.\n\n     Then we began to ride.  My soul\n     Smoothed itself out, a long-cramped scroll\n     Freshening and fluttering in the wind.\n     Past hopes already lay behind.\n       What need to strive with a life awry?\n     Had I said that, had I done this,\n     So might I gain, so might I miss.\n     Might she have loved me? just as well\n     She might have hated, who can tell!\n     Where had I been now if the worst befell?\n       And here we are riding, she and I.\n\n\n       5.\n\n     Fail I alone, in words and deeds?\n     Why, all men strive and who succeeds?\n     We rode; it seemed my spirit flew,\n     Saw other regions, cities new,\n       As the world rushed by on either side.\n     I thought,--All labor, yet no less\n     Bear up beneath their unsuccess.\n     Look at the end of work, contrast\n     The petty done, the undone vast,\n     This present of theirs with the hopeful past!\n       I hoped she would love me:  here we ride.\n\n\n       6.\n\n     What hand and brain went ever paired?\n     What heart alike conceived and dared?\n     What act proved all its thought had been?\n     What will but felt the fleshy screen?\n       We ride and I see her bosom heave.\n     There’s many a crown for who can reach.\n     Ten lines, a statesman’s life in each!\n     The flag stuck on a heap of bones,\n     A soldier’s doing! what atones?\n     They scratch his name on the Abbey-stones.\n       My riding is better, by their leave.\n\n\n       7.\n\n     What does it all mean, poet?  Well,\n     Your brains beat into rhythm, you tell\n     What we felt only; you expressed\n     You hold things beautiful the best,\n       And pace them in rhyme so, side by side.\n     ‘Tis something, nay ‘tis much:  but then,\n     Have you yourself what’s best for men?\n     Are you--poor, sick, old ere your time--\n     Nearer one whit your own sublime\n     Than we who have never turned a rhyme?\n       Sing, riding’s a joy!

He digresses here, and does not return to the subject till\nthe 31st stanza, “What did I say?--that a small bird sings”.\nThe path gray heads abhor:  this verse and the following stanza are,\nwith most readers, the CRUX of the poem; “gray heads” must be\nunderstood with some restriction:  many gray heads, not all, abhor\n--gray heads who went along through their flowery youth\nas if it had no limit, and without insuring, in Love’s true season,\nthe happiness of their lives beyond youth’s limit, “life’s safe hem”,\nwhich to cross without such insurance, is often fatal.  And these,\nwhen they reach old age, shun retracing the path which led to\nthe gulf wherein their youth dropped.\n\n\n       22.\n\n     For it leads to a crag’s sheer edge with them;\n       Youth, flowery all the way, there stops--\n     Not they; age threatens and they contemn,\n       Till they reach the gulf wherein youth drops,\n     One inch from our life’s safe hem!\n\n\n       23.\n\n     With me, youth led. . .I will speak now,\n       No longer watch you as you sit\n     Reading by firelight, that great brow\n       And the spirit-small hand propping it,\n     Mutely, my heart knows how--\n\n    --\n     St. 23.  With me:  the speaker continues,\n     youth led:--we are told whither, in St. 25, v. 4, “to an age\n     so blest that, by its side, youth seems the waste instead”.\n     I will speak now:  up to this point his reflections have been silent,\n     his wife, the while, reading, mutely, by fire-light,\n     his heart knows how, that is, with her heart secretly responsive\n     to his own.  The mutual responsiveness of their hearts is expressed\n     in St. 24.\n\n\n       24.\n\n     When, if I think but deep enough,\n       You are wont to answer, prompt as rhyme;\n     And you, too, find without rebuff\n       Response your soul seeks many a time,\n     Piercing its fine flesh-stuff.\n\n\n       25.\n\n     My own, confirm me!  If I tread\n       This path back, is it not in pride\n     To think how little I dreamed it led\n       To an age so blest that, by its side,\n     Youth seems the waste instead?\n\n\n       26.\n\n     My own, see where the years conduct!\n       At first, ‘twas something our two souls\n     Should mix as mists do; each is sucked\n       In each now:  on, the new stream rolls,\n     Whatever rocks obstruct.\n\n\n       27.\n\n       Think, when our one soul understands\n     The great Word which makes all things new,\n       When earth breaks up and heaven expands,\n       How will the change strike me and you\n     In the house not made with hands?\n\n\n       28.\n\n     Oh I must feel your brain prompt mine,\n       Your heart anticipate my heart,\n     You must be just before, in fine,\n       See and make me see, for your part,\n     New depths of the divine!\n\n    --\n     St. 28.  “The conviction of the eternity of marriage meets us\n     again and again in Browning’s poems; e.g., ‘Prospice’,\n     ‘Any Wife to any Husband’, ‘The Epilogue to Fifine’.”\n      The union between two complementary souls cannot be dissolved.\n     “Love is all, and Death is nought!”\n\n\n       29.\n\n     But who could have expected this\n       When we two drew together first\n     Just for the obvious human bliss,\n       To satisfy life’s daily thirst\n     With a thing men seldom miss?\n\n\n       30.\n\n     Come back with me to the first of all,\n       Let us lean and love it over again,\n     Let us now forget and now recall,\n       Break the rosary in a pearly rain,\n     And gather what we let fall!\n\n\n       31.\n\n     What did I say?--that a small bird sings\n       All day long, save when a brown pair\n     Of hawks from the wood float with wide wings\n       Strained to a bell:  ‘gainst noonday glare\n     You count the streaks and rings.\n\n    --\n     St. 31.

When lightning searches\nfor the guilty lovers, Ottima and Sebald {in ‘Pippa Passes’},\nlike an angelic sword plunged into the gloom, when the tender twilight\nwith its one chrysolite star, grows aware, and the light and shade\nmake up a spell, and the forests by their mystery, and sound,\nand silence, mingle together two human lives forever\n{‘By the Fireside’}, when the apparition of the moon-rainbow\nappears gloriously after storm, and Christ is in his heaven\n{‘Christmas Eve’}, when to David the stars shoot out the pain\nof pent knowledge and in the grey of the hills at morning there dwells\na gathered intensity {‘Saul’},--then nature rises from her sweet ways\nof use and wont, and shows herself the Priestess, the Pythoness,\nthe Divinity which she is.

The failure of fruit in her husband proved the absoluteness\nof her love, proved that he was her all, notwithstanding.\n\n\n       7.\n\n     Yet this turns now to a fault--there! there!\n       That I do love, watch too long,\n     And wait too well, and weary and wear;\n     And ‘tis all an old story, and my despair\n       Fit subject for some new song:\n\n--\nSt. 7.

Love:  settling on the minds of men, the level and low,\nthe burnt and bare, is compared to the cricket and the butterfly\nsettling on the turf and the rock.\n\n\n     VI.

The one\n       So long escaping from lips starved and blue,\n     That lasts while on her pallet-bed the nun\n       Stretches her length; her foot comes through\n     The straw she shivers on;\n\n\n       5.\n\n     “You had not thought she was so tall:  and spent,\n       Her shrunk lids open, her lean fingers shut\n     Close, close, their sharp and livid nails indent\n       The clammy palm; then all is mute:\n     That way, the spirit went.\n\n\n       6.\n\n     “Or wouldst thou rather that I understand\n       Thy will to help me?--like the dog I found\n     Once, pacing sad this solitary strand,\n       Who would not take my food, poor hound,\n     But whined, and licked my hand.”\n\n--\nSt. 1-6.  See foot-note to the Argument of this section.\n\n\n       7.\n\n     All this, and more, comes from some young man’s pride\n       Of power to see,--in failure and mistake,\n     Relinquishment, disgrace, on every side,--\n       Merely examples for his sake,\n     Helps to his path untried:\n\n\n       8.\n\n     Instances he must--simply recognize?\n       Oh, more than so!--must, with a learner’s zeal,\n     Make doubly prominent, twice emphasize,\n       By added touches that reveal\n     The god in babe’s disguise.\n\n\n       9.\n\n     Oh, he knows what defeat means, and the rest!\n       Himself the undefeated that shall be:\n     Failure, disgrace, he flings them you to test,--\n       His triumph, in eternity\n     Too plainly manifest!\n\n--\nSt. 7-9.  She reflects, ironically and sarcastically,\nupon the confidence of the young poet, resulting from his immaturity,\nin his future triumph over all obstacles.  Inexperienced as he is,\nhe feels himself the god in babe’s disguise, etc.  He will learn\nafter a while what the wind means in its moaning.  The train of thought\nin St. 11-16 is presented in the Argument.\n\n\n       10.\n\n     Whence, judge if he learn forthwith what the wind\n       Means in its moaning--by the happy prompt\n     Instinctive way of youth, I mean; for kind\n       Calm years, exacting their accompt\n     Of pain, mature the mind:\n\n\n       11.\n\n     And some midsummer morning, at the lull\n       Just about daybreak, as he looks across\n     A sparkling foreign country, wonderful\n       To the sea’s edge for gloom and gloss,\n     Next minute must annul,--\n\n\n       12.\n\n     Then, when the wind begins among the vines,\n       So low, so low, what shall it say but this?\n     “Here is the change beginning, here the lines\n       Circumscribe beauty, set to bliss\n     The limit time assigns.”\n\n\n       13.\n\n     Nothing can be as it has been before;\n       Better, so call it, only not the same.\n     To draw one beauty into our hearts’ core,\n       And keep it changeless! such our claim;\n     So answered,--Never more!\n\n\n       14.\n\n     Simple?  Why this is the old woe o’ the world;\n       Tune, to whose rise and fall we live and die.\n     Rise with it, then!  Rejoice that man is hurled\n       From change to change unceasingly,\n     His soul’s wings never furled!\n\n\n       15.\n\n     That’s a new question; still replies the fact,\n       Nothing endures:  the wind moans, saying so;\n     We moan in acquiescence:  there’s life’s pact,\n       Perhaps probation--do I know?\n     God does:  endure his act!\n\n\n       16.\n\n     Only, for man, how bitter not to grave\n       On his soul’s hands’ palms one fair good wise thing\n     Just as he grasped it!  For himself, death’s wave;\n       While time first washes--ah, the sting!--\n     O’er all he’d sink to save.\n\n\n     VII.

He went through his apprenticeship\nunder Cimabue, and practised as a painter and architect\nnot only in Florence, but in various parts of Italy, in free cities\nas well as in the courts of princes. . . .  On April 12, 1334,\nGiotto was appointed by the civic authorities of Florence,\nchief master of the Cathedral works, the city fortifications,\nand all public architectural undertakings, in an instrument of which\nthe wording constitutes the most affectionate homage to\nthe ‘great and dear master’.

The conjecture of Flaxman that the statue\nwas suggested by the bronze Apollo Alexikakos of Kalamis,\nmentioned by Pausanias, remains probable; though the ‘hardness’\nwhich Cicero considers to distinguish the artist’s workmanship\nfrom that of Muron is not by any means apparent in our marble copy,\nif it be one.--Feb. 16, 1880.”--The Poet’s Note.\n\nNiobe:  group of ancient sculpture, in the gallery of the Uffizi Palace,\nin Florence, representing Niobe mourning the death of her children.\nthe Racers’ frieze:  the frieze of the Parthenon is perhaps meant,\nthe reference being to the FULNESS OF LIFE exhibited by\nthe men and horses.\n\nThe dying Alexander:  “‘The Dying Alexander’, at Florence.\nThis well-known, beautiful, and deeply affecting head,\nwhich bears a strong resemblance to the Alexander Helios of the Capitol\n--especially in the treatment of the hair--has been called\nby Ottfried Mueller a riddle of archaeology.  It is no doubt\na Greek original, and one of the most interesting remains\nof ancient art, but we cannot take it for granted that it is intended\nfor Alexander, and still less that it is the work of Lysippus.\nIt is difficult to imagine that the favored and devoted artist\nof the mighty conqueror would choose to portray his great master\nin a painful and impotent struggle with disease and death.\nThis consideration makes it extremely improbable that it was executed\nduring the lifetime of Alexander, and the whole character of the work,\nin which free pathos is the prevailing element, and its close\nresemblance in style to the heads on coins of the period\nof the Diadochi, point to a later age than that of Lysippus.”\n --‘Greek and Roman Sculpture’ by Walter Copland Perry.

It re-stated THE TRUTH\nof the soul which informs the body, and the body which expresses it.\nMen saw in its creations their own qualities carried to perfection,\nand were content to know that such perfection was possible\nand to renounce the hope of attaining it.  In this experience\nthe first stage was progress, the second was stagnation.\nProgress began again when men looked on these images of themselves\nand said:  ‘we are not inferior to these.  We are greater than they.\nFor what has come to perfection perishes, and we are imperfect because\neternity is before us; because we were made to GROW.’”--Mrs. Orr’s\nHandbook to the Works of R. B.\n\nSt. 17.  “O!”:  Boniface VIII. (not Benedict IX., as Vasari has it),\nwishing to employ Giotto, sent a courtier to obtain some proof\nof his skill.  The latter requesting a drawing to send to his Holiness,\nGiotto took a sheet of paper and a pencil dipped in red color;\nthen resting his elbow on his side, to form a compass,\nwith one turn of his hand he drew a circle so perfect and exact,\nthat it was a marvel to behold.  This done, he turned to the courtier,\nsaying, “Here is your drawing.”  The courtier seems to have thought\nthat Giotto was fooling him; but the pope was easily convinced,\nby the roundness of the O, of the greatness of Giotto’s skill.\nThis incident gave rise to the proverb, “Tu sei piu tondo che l’ O\ndi Giotto”, the point of which lies in the word ‘tondo’,\nsignifying slowness of intellect, as well as a circle.\n--Adapted from Vasari and Heaton.\n\n\n       18.\n\n     Is it true that we are now, and shall be hereafter,\n       But what and where depend on life’s minute?\n     Hails heavenly cheer or infernal laughter\n       Our first step out of the gulf or in it?\n     Shall Man, such step within his endeavor,\n       Man’s face, have no more play and action\n     Than joy which is crystallized forever,\n       Or grief, an eternal petrifaction?\n\n    --\n     St. 18.  life’s minute:  life’s short span.\n\n\n       19.\n\n     On which I conclude, that the early painters,\n       To cries of “Greek Art and what more wish you?”--\n     Replied, “To become now self-acquainters,\n       And paint man, man, whatever the issue!\n     Make new hopes shine through the flesh they fray,\n       New fears aggrandize the rags and tatters:\n     To bring the invisible full into play,\n       Let the visible go to the dogs--what matters?”\n\n\n       20.\n\n     Give these, I exhort you, their guerdon and glory\n       For daring so much, before they well did it.\n     The first of the new, in our race’s story,\n       Beats the last of the old; ‘tis no idle quiddit.\n     The worthies began a revolution,\n       Which if on earth you intend to acknowledge,\n     Why, honor them now!

Gal.,\npainted for the Pucci Chapel in the Church of San Sebastiano de’ Servi,\nat Florence.  ‘This painting’, says Vasari, ‘has been more extolled\nthan any other ever executed by Antonio’.  It is, however,\nunpleasantly hard and obtrusively anatomical.  Pollajuolo is said to\nhave been the first artist who studied anatomy by means of dissection,\nand his sole aim in this picture seems to have been to display\nhis knowledge of muscular action.

His works were distinguished\nfor extreme minuteness of detail.  “In the church of the Annunziata\nin Florence, he executed an historical piece in fresco,\nbut finished ‘a secco’, wherein he represented the Nativity of Christ,\npainted with such minuteness of care, that each separate straw\nin the roof of a cabin, figured therein, may be counted,\nand every knot in these straws distinguished.”--Vasari.\nHis remaining works are much injured by scaling or the abrasion of\nthe colors.\n\n\n       28.\n\n     Margheritone of Arezzo,\n       With the grave-clothes garb and swaddling barret\n     (Why purse up mouth and beak in a pet so,\n       You bald old saturnine poll-clawed parrot?)\n     Not a poor glimmering Crucifixion,\n       Where in the foreground kneels the donor?\n     If such remain, as is my conviction,\n       The hoarding it does you but little honor.\n\n--\nSt. 28.

Nothing, however,\ncan be more unlike nature, than the grim Madonna and the weird\nstarved Child in her arms (see ‘Wornum’s Catal. Nat. Gal.’,\nfor a description of this painting).  Margaritone’s favorite subject\nwas the figure of St. Francis, his style being well suited to depict\nthe chief ascetic saint.

Ah, but what does he,\n     The cousin! what does he to please you more?\n\n     I am grown peaceful as old age to-night.\n     I regret little, I would change still less.\n     Since there my past life lies, why alter it?\n     The very wrong to Francis!--it is true\n     I took his coin, was tempted and complied,\n     And built this house and sinned, and all is said.\n     My father and my mother died of want.                  {250}\n     Well, had I riches of my own? you see\n     How one gets rich!  Let each one bear his lot.\n     They were born poor, lived poor, and poor they died:\n     And I have labored somewhat in my time\n     And not been paid profusely.  Some good son\n     Paint my two hundred pictures--let him try!\n     No doubt, there’s something strikes a balance.  Yes,\n     You loved me quite enough, it seems to-night.\n     This must suffice me here.  What would one have?\n     In heaven, perhaps, new chances, one more chance--  {260}\n     Four great walls in the New Jerusalem,\n     Meted on each side by the angel’s reed,\n     For Leonard, Rafael, Agnolo, and me\n     To cover--the three first without a wife,\n     While I have mine!  So--still they overcome\n     Because there’s still Lucrezia,--as I choose.\n\n     Again the cousin’s whistle!  Go, my love.\n\n--\n29.  My face, my moon:\n\n     “Once, like the moon, I made\n     The ever-shifting currents of the blood\n     According to my humor ebb and flow.”\n                   --Cleopatra, in Tennyson’s ‘A Dream of Fair Women’.\n\n     “You are the powerful moon of my blood’s sea,\n     To make it ebb or flow into my face\n     As your looks change.”\n                   --Ford and Decker’s ‘Witch of Edmonton’.\n\n35.  A common grayness:  Andrea del Sarto was distinguished\nfor his skill in chiaro-oscuro.\n\n82.  low-pulsed forthright craftsman’s hand:  “Andrea del Sarto’s was,\nafter all, but the ‘low-pulsed forthright craftsman’s hand’,\nand therefore his perfect art does not touch our hearts like that\nof Fra Bartolommeo, who occupies about the same position with regard to\nthe great masters of the century as Andrea del Sarto.  Fra Bartolommeo\nspoke from his heart.  He was moved by the spirit, so to speak,\nto express his pure and holy thoughts in beautiful language,\nand the ideal that presented itself to his mind, and from which he,\nequally with Raphael, worked, approached almost as closely as Raphael’s\nto that abstract beauty after which they both longed.  Andrea del Sarto\nhad no such longing:  he was content with the loveliness of earth.\nThis he could understand and imitate in its fullest perfection,\nand therefore he troubled himself but little about\nthe ‘wondrous paterne’ laid up in heaven.  Many of his Madonnas\nhave greater beauty, strictly speaking, than those of Bartolommeo,\nor even of Raphael; but we miss in them that mysterious\nspiritual loveliness that gives the latter their chief charm.”\n --Heaton’s History of Painting.\n\n93.  Morello:  the highest of the spurs of the Apennines\nto the north of Florence.\n\n96.  Speak as they please, what does the mountain care?:  it’s beyond\ntheir criticism.\n\n105.  The Urbinate:  Raphael Santi, born 1483, in Urbino.\nAndrea sees in Raphael, whose technique was inferior to his own,\nhis superior, as he reached above and through his art--\nfor it gives way.\n\n106.  George Vasari:  see note under St. 9 of ‘Old Pictures\nin Florence’.\n\n120.  Nay, Love, you did give all I asked:  it must be understood\nthat his wife has replied with pique, to what he said\nin the two preceding lines.\n\n129.  by the future:  when placed by, in comparison with, the future.\n\n130.  Agnolo:  Michael Angelo (more correctly, Agnolo) Buonarotti.\nSee note under St. 30 of ‘Old Pictures in Florence’.\n\n146.  For fear of chancing on the Paris lords:  by reason of\nhis breaking the faith he had pledged to Francis I. of France,\nand using for his own purposes, or his wife’s, the money with which\nthe king had entrusted him to purchase works of art in Italy.\n\n149-165.  That Francis, that first time:  he thinks with regret\nof the king and of his honored and inspiring stay at his court.\n\n161.  by those hearts:  along with, by the aid of.\n\n173.  The triumph was. . .there:  i.e., in your heart.\n\n174.  ere the triumph:  in France.\n\n177.  Rafael did this, . . .was his wife:  a remark ascribed to\nsome critic.\n\n198.  If he spoke the truth:  i.e., about himself.\n\n199.  What he:  do you ask?\n\n202.  all I care for. . .is whether you’re.\n\n209.  Morello’s gone:  its outlines are lost in the dusk.  See v. 93.\n\n218.  That gold of his:  see note to v. 146.\n\n220.  That cousin here again?:  one of Lucrezia’s gallants\nis referred to, to pay whose gaming debts, it appears,\nshe has obtained money of her husband.  It must be understood\nthat this gallant whistles here.  See last verse of the monologue.\n\n263.  Leonard:  Leonardo da Vinci.\n\n\n\n\nFra Lippo Lippi.\n\n\n\n   I am poor brother Lippo, by your leave!\n   You need not clap your torches to my face.\n   Zooks, what’s to blame? you think you see a monk!\n   What, ‘tis past midnight, and you go the rounds,\n   And here you catch me at an alley’s end\n   Where sportive ladies leave their doors ajar?\n   The Carmine’s my cloister:  hunt it up,\n   Do,--harry out, if you must show your zeal,\n   Whatever rat, there, haps on his wrong hole,\n   And nip each softling of a wee white mouse,                       {10}\n   ‘Weke, weke’, that’s crept to keep him company!\n   Aha! you know your betters?  Then, you’ll take\n   Your hand away that’s fiddling on my throat,\n   And please to know me likewise.  Who am I?\n   Why, one, sir, who is lodging with a friend\n   Three streets off--he’s a certain. . .how d’ye call?\n   Master--a. . .Cosimo of the Medici,\n   I’ the house that caps the corner.  Boh! you were best!\n   Remember and tell me, the day you’re hanged,\n   How you affected such a gullet’s-gripe!                           {20}\n   But you, sir, it concerns you that your knaves\n   Pick up a manner, nor discredit you:\n   Zooks, are we pilchards, that they sweep the streets\n   And count fair prize what comes into their net?\n   He’s Judas to a tittle, that man is!\n   Just such a face!  Why, sir, you make amends.\n   Lord, I’m not angry!  Bid your hangdogs go\n   Drink out this quarter-florin to the health\n   Of the munificent House that harbors me\n   (And many more beside, lads! more beside!)                        {30}\n   And all’s come square again.  I’d like his face--\n   His, elbowing on his comrade in the door\n   With the pike and lantern,--for the slave that holds\n   John Baptist’s head a-dangle by the hair\n   With one hand (“Look you, now”, as who should say)\n   And his weapon in the other, yet unwiped!\n   It’s not your chance to have a bit of chalk,\n   A wood-coal or the like? or you should see!\n   Yes, I’m the painter, since you style me so.\n   What, brother Lippo’s doings, up and down,                        {40}\n   You know them, and they take you? like enough!\n   I saw the proper twinkle in your eye--\n   ‘Tell you, I liked your looks at very first.\n   Let’s sit and set things straight now, hip to haunch.\n   Here’s spring come, and the nights one makes up bands\n   To roam the town and sing out carnival,\n   And I’ve been three weeks shut within my mew,\n   A-painting for the great man, saints and saints\n   And saints again.  I could not paint all night--\n   Ouf!  I leaned out of window for fresh air.                       {50}\n   There came a hurry of feet and little feet,\n   A sweep of lute-strings, laughs, and whifts of song--\n   ‘Flower o’ the broom,\n   Take away love, and our earth is a tomb!\n   Flower o’ the quince,\n   I let Lisa go, and what good in life since?\n   Flower o’ the thyme’--and so on.  Round they went.\n   Scarce had they turned the corner when a titter\n   Like the skipping of rabbits by moonlight,--three slim shapes,\n   And a face that looked up. . .zooks, sir, flesh and blood,        {60}\n   That’s all I’m made of!  Into shreds it went,\n   Curtain and counterpane and coverlet,\n   All the bed-furniture--a dozen knots,\n   There was a ladder!  Down I let myself,\n   Hands and feet, scrambling somehow, and so dropped,\n   And after them.  I came up with the fun\n   Hard by Saint Lawrence, hail fellow, well met,--\n   ‘Flower o’ the rose,\n   If I’ve been merry, what matter who knows?’\n   And so, as I was stealing back again,                             {70}\n   To get to bed and have a bit of sleep\n   Ere I rise up to-morrow and go work\n   On Jerome knocking at his poor old breast\n   With his great round stone to subdue the flesh,\n   You snap me of the sudden.  Ah, I see!\n   Though your eye twinkles still, you shake your head--\n   Mine’s shaved--a monk, you say--the sting’s in that!\n   If Master Cosimo announced himself,\n   Mum’s the word naturally; but a monk!\n   Come, what am I a beast for? tell us, now!                        {80}\n   I was a baby when my mother died\n   And father died and left me in the street.\n   I starved there, God knows how, a year or two\n   On fig-skins, melon-parings, rinds and shucks,\n   Refuse and rubbish.  One fine frosty day,\n   My stomach being empty as your hat,\n   The wind doubled me up and down I went.\n   Old aunt Lapaccia trussed me with one hand\n   (Its fellow was a stinger, as I knew),\n   And so along the wall, over the bridge,                           {90}\n   By the straight cut to the convent.  Six words there,\n   While I stood munching my first bread that month:\n   “So, boy, you’re minded,” quoth the good fat father\n   Wiping his own mouth, ‘twas refection-time,--\n   “To quit this very miserable world?\n   Will you renounce”. . .\"the mouthful of bread?” thought I;\n   By no means!  Brief, they made a monk of me;\n   I did renounce the world, its pride and greed,\n   Palace, farm, villa, shop, and banking-house,\n   Trash, such as these poor devils of Medici                       {100}\n   Have given their hearts to--all at eight years old.\n   Well, sir, I found in time, you may be sure,\n   ‘Twas not for nothing--the good bellyful,\n   The warm serge and the rope that goes all round,\n   And day-long blessed idleness beside!\n   “Let’s see what the urchin’s fit for”--that came next.\n   Not overmuch their way, I must confess.\n   Such a to-do!  They tried me with their books:\n   Lord, they’d have taught me Latin in pure waste!\n   ‘Flower o’ the clove,                                            {110}\n   All the Latin I construe is, “Amo” I love!’\n   But, mind you, when a boy starves in the streets\n   Eight years together as my fortune was,\n   Watching folk’s faces to know who will fling\n   The bit of half-stripped grape-bunch he desires,\n   And who will curse or kick him for his pains,--\n   Which gentleman processional and fine,\n   Holding a candle to the Sacrament,\n   Will wink and let him lift a plate and catch\n   The droppings of the wax to sell again,                          {120}\n   Or holla for the Eight and have him whipped,--\n   How say I?--nay, which dog bites, which lets drop\n   His bone from the heap of offal in the street,--\n   Why, soul and sense of him grow sharp alike,\n   He learns the look of things, and none the less\n   For admonition from the hunger-pinch.\n   I had a store of such remarks, be sure,\n   Which, after I found leisure, turned to use:\n   I drew men’s faces on my copy-books,\n   Scrawled them within the antiphonary’s marge,                    {130}\n   Joined legs and arms to the long music-notes,\n   Found eyes and nose and chin for A’s and B’s,\n   And made a string of pictures of the world\n   Betwixt the ins and outs of verb and noun,\n   On the wall, the bench, the door.  The monks looked black.\n   “Nay,” quoth the Prior, “turn him out, d’ye say?\n   In no wise.  Lose a crow and catch a lark.\n   What if at last we get our man of parts,\n   We Carmelites, like those Camaldolese\n   And Preaching Friars, to do our church up fine                   {140}\n   And put the front on it that ought to be!”\n    And hereupon he bade me daub away.\n   Thank you! my head being crammed, the walls a blank,\n   Never was such prompt disemburdening.\n   First every sort of monk, the black and white,\n   I drew them, fat and lean:  then, folks at church,\n   From good old gossips waiting to confess\n   Their cribs of barrel-droppings, candle-ends,--\n   To the breathless fellow at the altar-foot,\n   Fresh from his murder, safe and sitting there                    {150}\n   With the little children round him in a row\n   Of admiration, half for his beard, and half\n   For that white anger of his victim’s son\n   Shaking a fist at him with one fierce arm,\n   Signing himself with the other because of Christ\n   (Whose sad face on the cross sees only this\n   After the passion of a thousand years),\n   Till some poor girl, her apron o’er her head\n   (Which the intense eyes looked through), came at eve\n   On tiptoe, said a word, dropped in a loaf,                       {160}\n   Her pair of ear-rings and a bunch of flowers\n   (The brute took growling), prayed, and so was gone.\n   I painted all, then cried, “‘Tis ask and have;\n   Choose, for more’s ready!”--laid the ladder flat,\n   And showed my covered bit of cloister-wall.\n   The monks closed in a circle and praised loud\n   Till checked, taught what to see and not to see,\n   Being simple bodies,--“That’s the very man!\n   Look at the boy who stoops to pat the dog!\n   That woman’s like the Prior’s niece who comes                    {170}\n   To care about his asthma:  it’s the life!”\n    But there my triumph’s straw-fire flared and funked;\n   Their betters took their turn to see and say:\n   The prior and the learned pulled a face\n   And stopped all that in no time.  “How? what’s here?\n   Quite from the mark of painting, bless us all!\n   Faces, arms, legs, and bodies like the true\n   As much as pea and pea! it’s devil’s game!\n   Your business is not to catch men with show,\n   With homage to the perishable clay,                              {180}\n   But lift them over it, ignore it all,\n   Make them forget there’s such a thing as flesh.\n   Your business is to paint the souls of men--\n   Man’s soul, and it’s a fire, smoke. . .no, it’s not. . .\n   It’s vapor done up like a new-born babe--\n   (In that shape when you die it leaves your mouth),\n   It’s. . .well, what matters talking, it’s the soul!\n   Give us no more of body than shows soul!\n   Here’s Giotto, with his Saint a-praising God,\n   That sets us praising,--why not stop with him?                 {190}\n   Why put all thoughts of praise out of our head\n   With wonder at lines, colors, and what not?\n   Paint the soul, never mind the legs and arms!\n   Rub all out, try at it a second time!\n   Oh, that white smallish female with the breasts,\n   She’s just my niece. . .Herodias, I would say,--\n   Who went and danced, and got men’s heads cut off!\n   Have it all out!”  Now, is this sense, I ask?\n   A fine way to paint soul, by painting body\n   So ill, the eye can’t stop there, must go further                {200}\n   And can’t fare worse!  Thus, yellow does for white\n   When what you put for yellow’s simply black,\n   And any sort of meaning looks intense\n   When all beside itself means and looks naught.\n   Why can’t a painter lift each foot in turn,\n   Left foot and right foot, go a double step,\n   Make his flesh liker and his soul more like,\n   Both in their order?  Take the prettiest face,\n   The Prior’s niece. . .patron-saint--is it so pretty\n   You can’t discover if it means hope, fear,                       {210}\n   Sorrow or joy? won’t beauty go with these?\n   Suppose I’ve made her eyes all right and blue,\n   Can’t I take breath and try to add life’s flash,\n   And then add soul and heighten them threefold?\n   Or say there’s beauty with no soul at all--\n   (I never saw it--put the case the same--)\n   If you get simple beauty and naught else,\n   You get about the best thing God invents:\n   That’s somewhat:  and you’ll find the soul you have missed,\n   Within yourself, when you return him thanks.                     {220}\n   “Rub all out!”  Well, well, there’s my life, in short,\n   And so the thing has gone on ever since.\n   I’m grown a man no doubt, I’ve broken bounds:\n   You should not take a fellow eight years old\n   And make him swear to never kiss the girls.\n   I’m my own master, paint now as I please--\n   Having a friend, you see, in the Corner-house!\n   Lord, it’s fast holding by the rings in front--\n   Those great rings serve more purposes than just\n   To plant a flag in, or tie up a horse!                           {230}\n   And yet the old schooling sticks, the old grave eyes\n   Are peeping o’er my shoulder as I work,\n   The heads shake still--“It’s art’s decline, my son!\n   You’re not of the true painters, great and old;\n   Brother Angelico’s the man, you’ll find;\n   Brother Lorenzo stands his single peer:\n   Fag on at flesh, you’ll never make the third!”\n    ‘Flower o’ the pine,\n   You keep your mistr. . .manners, and I’ll stick to mine!’\n   I’m not the third, then:  bless us, they must know!              {240}\n   Don’t you think they’re the likeliest to know,\n   They with their Latin?  So, I swallow my rage,\n   Clinch my teeth, suck my lips in tight, and paint\n   To please them--sometimes do, and sometimes don’t;\n   For, doing most, there’s pretty sure to come\n   A turn, some warm eve finds me at my saints--\n   A laugh, a cry, the business of the world--\n   (‘Flower o’ the peach,\n   Death for us all, and his own life for each!’)\n   And my whole soul revolves, the cup runs over,                   {250}\n   The world and life’s too big to pass for a dream,\n   And I do these wild things in sheer despite,\n   And play the fooleries you catch me at,\n   In pure rage!  The old mill-horse, out at grass\n   After hard years, throws up his stiff heels so,\n   Although the miller does not preach to him\n   The only good of grass is to make chaff.\n   What would men have?  Do they like grass or no--\n   May they or mayn’t they? all I want’s the thing\n   Settled forever one way.  As it is,                              {260}\n   You tell too many lies and hurt yourself:\n   You don’t like what you only like too much,\n   You do like what, if given you at your word,\n   You find abundantly detestable.\n   For me, I think I speak as I was taught;\n   I always see the garden, and God there\n   A-making man’s wife:  and, my lesson learned,\n   The value and significance of flesh,\n   I can’t unlearn ten minutes afterwards.\n\n   You understand me:  I’m a beast, I know.                         {270}\n   But see, now--why, I see as certainly\n   As that the morning-star’s about to shine,\n   What will hap some day.  We’ve a youngster here\n   Comes to our convent, studies what I do,\n   Slouches and stares and lets no atom drop:\n   His name is Guidi--he’ll not mind the monks--\n   They call him Hulking Tom, he lets them talk--\n   He picks my practice up--he’ll paint apace,\n   I hope so--though I never live so long,\n   I know what’s sure to follow.  You be judge!                     {280}\n   You speak no Latin more than I, belike;\n   However, you’re my man, you’ve seen the world\n --The beauty and the wonder and the power,\n   The shapes of things, their colors, lights, and shades,\n   Changes, surprises,--and God made it all!\n --For what?  Do you feel thankful, ay or no,\n   For this fair town’s face, yonder river’s line,\n   The mountain round it and the sky above,\n   Much more the figures of man, woman, child,\n   These are the frame to?  What’s it all about?                    {290}\n   To be passed over, despised? or dwelt upon,\n   Wondered at? oh, this last of course!--you say.\n   But why not do as well as say,--paint these\n   Just as they are, careless what comes of it?\n   God’s works--paint any one, and count it crime\n   To let a truth slip.  Don’t object, “His works\n   Are here already; nature is complete:\n   Suppose you reproduce her--(which you can’t)\n   There’s no advantage! you must beat her, then.”\n    For, don’t you mark? we’re made so that we love                  {300}\n   First when we see them painted, things we have passed\n   Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see;\n   And so they are better, painted--better to us,\n   Which is the same thing.  Art was given for that;\n   God uses us to help each other so,\n   Lending our minds out.  Have you noticed, now\n   Your cullion’s hanging face?  A bit of chalk,\n   And trust me but you should, though!  How much more\n   If I drew higher things with the same truth!\n   That were to take the Prior’s pulpit-place,                      {310}\n   Interpret God to all of you!  Oh, oh,\n   It makes me mad to see what men shall do\n   And we in our graves!  This world’s no blot for us,\n   Nor blank; it means intensely, and means good:\n   To find its meaning is my meat and drink.\n   “Ay, but you don’t so instigate to prayer!”\n    Strikes in the Prior:  “when your meaning’s plain\n   It does not say to folks--remember matins,\n   Or, mind your fast next Friday!”  Why, for this\n   What need of art at all?

To ‘paint the souls of men’, to ‘make them forget\nthere’s such a thing as flesh’, was the end of his art.  And,\nside by side with Angelico, Masaccio painted.  His short life\ntaught him a different lesson--‘the value and significance of flesh’.\nHe would paint by preference the BODIES of men, and would give us\nNO MORE OF SOUL than the body can reveal.  So he ‘laboured’,\nsaith the chronicler, ‘in nakeds’, and his frescoes mark\nan epoch in art.”--Ernest Bradford (B. S. Illustrations).\n\n“One artist in the seclusion of his cloister, remained true\nto the traditions and mode of expression of the middle ages, into which,\nnevertheless, the incomparable beauty and feeling of his nature\nbreathed fresh life.  Fra Giovanni Angelico, called da Fiesole\nfrom the place of his birth, occupies an entirely exceptional position.\nHe is the late-blooming flower of an almost by-gone time\namid the pulsations of a new life.  Never, in the whole range\nof pictorial art, have the inspired fervor of Christian feeling,\nthe angelic beauty and purity of which the soul is capable, been so\ngloriously interpreted as in his works.  The exquisite atmosphere\nof an almost supernaturally ideal life surrounds his pictures,\nirradiates the rosy features of his youthful faces, or greets us,\nlike the peace of God, in the dignified figures of his devout old men.\nHis prevailing themes are the humility of soul of those who\nhave joyfully accepted the will of God, and the tranquil Sabbath calm\nof those who are lovingly consecrated to the service of the Highest.\nThe movement and the changing course of life, the energy of passion\nand action concern him not.”--‘Outlines of the History of Art’.\nBy Dr. Wilh.

Tommaso Guidi (1401-1428), better known as Masaccio,\ni.e., Tommasaccio, Slovenly or Hulking Tom.  “From his time,\nand forward,” says Mr. Ernest Radford (B. S. Illustrations),\n“religious painting in the old sense was at an end.  Painters no longer\nattempted to transcend nature, but to copy her, and to copy her\nin her loveliest aspects.  The breach between the old order and the new\nwas complete.”  The poet makes him learn of Lippi, not,\nas Vasari states, Lippi of him.\n\n“When Browning wrote this poem, he knew that the mastership or pupilship\nof Fra Lippo to Masaccio (called ‘Guidi’ in the poem), and vice versa,\nwas a moot point; but in making Fra Lippi the master,\nhe followed the best authority he had access to, the last edition\nof Vasari, as he stated in a Letter to the ‘Pall Mall’ at the time,\nin answer to M. Etienne {a writer in the ‘Revue des deux Mondes’.}\nSince then, he finds that the latest enquirer into the subject,\nMorelli, believes the fact is the other way, and that Fra Lippo\nwas the pupil.”--B.

Vanity, saith the preacher, vanity!:  “The Bishop on his death-bed\nhas reached Solomon’s conclusion that ‘all is vanity’.  So he proceeds\nto specify his particular vanity in the choice of a tombstone.”\n --N. Brit. Rev. 34, p. 367.  “In ‘The Palace of Art’, Mr. Tennyson\nhas shown the despair and isolation of a soul surrounded by\nall luxuries of beauty, and living in and for them; but in the end\nthe soul is redeemed and converted to the simple humanities of earth.\nMr. Browning has shown that such a sense of isolation and such despair\nare by no means inevitable; there is a death in life which consists in\ntranquil satisfaction, a calm pride in the soul’s dwelling among\nthe world’s gathered treasures of stateliness and beauty.  . . .\nSo the unbelieving and worldly spirit of the dying Bishop, who orders\nhis tomb at Saint Praxed’s, his sense of the vanity of the world\nsimply because the world is passing out of his reach,\nthe regretful memory of the pleasures of his youth, the envious spite\ntowards Gandolf, who robbed him of the best position for a tomb,\nand the dread lest his reputed sons should play him false and fail\nto carry out his designs, are united with a perfect appreciation of\nRenaissance art, and a luxurious satisfaction, which even a death-bed\ncannot destroy, in the splendor of voluptuous form and color.”\n --Edward Dowden.\n\n46.

Oh, they praised you, I dare say!\n   “Brave Galuppi! that was music! good alike at grave and gay!\n   I can always leave off talking when I hear a master play!”\n\n\n     10.\n\n   Then they left you for their pleasure:  till in due time, one by one,\n   Some with lives that came to nothing, some with deeds as well undone,\n   Death stepped tacitly, and took them where they never see the sun.\n\n\n     11.\n\n   But when I sit down to reason, think to take my stand nor swerve,\n   While I triumph o’er a secret wrung from nature’s close reserve,\n   In you come with your cold music till I creep through every nerve.\n\n--\nSt. 11.  While I triumph o’er a secret wrung from nature’s\nclose reserve:  the secret of the soul’s immortality.\n\n\n     12.\n\n   Yes, you, like a ghostly cricket, creaking where a house was burned:\n   “Dust and ashes, dead and done with, Venice spent what Venice earned.\n   The soul, doubtless, is immortal--where a soul can be discerned.\n\n\n     13.\n\n   “Yours for instance:  you know physics, something of geology,\n   Mathematics are your pastime; souls shall rise in their degree;\n   Butterflies may dread extinction,--you’ll not die, it cannot be!\n\n--\nSt. 13.  The idea is involved in this stanza that the soul’s\ncontinued existence is dependent on its development in this life;\nthe ironic character of the stanza is indicated by the merely\nintellectual subjects named, physics, geology, mathematics,\nwhich do not of themselves, necessarily, contribute to\nSOUL-development.  All from the 2d verse of the 12th stanza\ndown to “Dust and ashes” in the 15th, is what the music,\n“like a ghostly cricket, creaking where a house was burned”,\nsays to the speaker, in the monologue, of the men and women for whom\nlife meant simply a butterfly enjoyment.\n\n\n     14.\n\n   “As for Venice and her people, merely born to bloom and drop,\n   Here on earth they bore their fruitage, mirth and folly were the crop:\n   What of soul was left, I wonder, when the kissing had to stop?\n\n\n     15.\n\n   “Dust and ashes!”  So you creak it, and I want the heart to scold.\n   Dear dead women, with such hair, too--what’s become of all the gold\n   Used to hang and brush their bosoms?  I feel chilly and grown old.\n\n\n\n\nAbt Vogler.\n\n(After he has been extemporizing upon the Musical Instrument\nof his Invention.)\n\n\n\n     1.\n\n   Would that the structure brave, the manifold music I build,\n     Bidding my organ obey, calling its keys to their work,\n   Claiming each slave of the sound, at a touch, as when Solomon willed\n     Armies of angels that soar, legions of demons that lurk,\n   Man, brute, reptile, fly,--alien of end and of aim,\n     Adverse, each from the other heaven-high, hell-deep removed,--\n   Should rush into sight at once as he named the ineffable Name,\n     And pile him a palace straight, to pleasure the princess he loved!\n\n--\nSt. 1.  The leading sentence, “Would that the structure brave”, etc.,\nis interrupted by the comparison, “as when Solomon willed”, etc.,\nand continued in the 2d stanza, “Would it might tarry like his”, etc.;\nthe construction of the comparison is, “as when Solomon willed\nthat armies of angels, legions of devils, etc., should rush into sight\nand pile him a palace straight”; the reference is to the legends\nof the Koran in regard to Solomon’s magical powers.\n\n\n     2.\n\n   Would it might tarry like his, the beautiful building of mine,\n     This which my keys in a crowd pressed and importuned to raise!\n   Ah, one and all, how they helped, would dispart now and now combine,\n     Zealous to hasten the work, heighten their master his praise!\n   And one would bury his brow with a blind plunge down to hell,\n     Burrow a while and build, broad on the roots of things,\n   Then up again swim into sight, having based me my palace well,\n     Founded it, fearless of flame, flat on the nether springs.\n\n--\nSt. 2.  the beautiful building of mine:  “Of all our senses,\nhearing seems to be the most poetical; and because it requires\nmost imagination.  We do not simply listen to sounds,\nbut whether they be articulate or inarticulate, we are constantly\ntranslating them into the language of sight, with which we are\nbetter acquainted; and this is a work of the imaginative faculty.”\n --‘Poetics:  an Essay on Poetry’.  By E. S. Dallas.\n\nThe idea expressed in the above extract is beautifully embodied\nin the following lines from Coleridge’s ‘Kubla Khan’:--\n\n     “It was a miracle of rare device,\n     A sunny pleasure-dome, with caves of ice!\n     A damsel with a dulcimer\n     In a vision once I saw:\n     It was an Abyssinian maid,\n     And on her dulcimer she played,\n     Singing of Mount Abora.\n     Could I revive within me\n     Her symphony and song,\n     To such a deep delight ‘twould win me,\n     That with music loud and long,\n     I would build that dome in air,\n     That sunny dome! those caves of ice!\n     And all who HEARD should SEE them there”, etc.\n\n\n     3.\n\n   And another would mount and march, like the excellent minion he was,\n     Ay, another and yet another, one crowd but with many a crest,\n   Raising my rampired walls of gold as transparent as glass,\n     Eager to do and die, yield each his place to the rest:\n   For higher still and higher (as a runner tips with fire,\n     When a great illumination surprises a festal night--\n   Outlining round and round Rome’s dome from space to spire)\n     Up, the pinnacled glory reached, and the pride of my soul was in sight.\n\n\n     4.\n\n   In sight?  Not half! for it seemed, it was certain, to match man’s birth,\n     Nature in turn conceived, obeying an impulse as I;\n   And the emulous heaven yearned down, made effort to reach the earth,\n     As the earth had done her best, in my passion, to scale the sky:\n   Novel splendors burst forth, grew familiar and dwelt with mine,\n     Not a point nor peak but found, but fixed its wandering star;\n   Meteor-moons, balls of blaze:  and they did not pale nor pine,\n     For earth had attained to heaven, there was no more near nor far.\n\n\n     5.\n\n   Nay more; for there wanted not who walked in the glare and glow,\n     Presences plain in the place; or, fresh from the Protoplast,\n   Furnished for ages to come, when a kindlier wind should blow,\n     Lured now to begin and live, in a house to their liking at last;\n   Or else the wonderful Dead who have passed through the body and gone,\n     But were back once more to breathe in an old world worth their new:\n   What never had been, was now; what was, as it shall be anon;\n     And what is,--shall I say, matched both? for I was made perfect too.\n\n\n     6.\n\n   All through my keys that gave their sounds to a wish of my soul,\n     All through my soul that praised as its wish flowed visibly forth,\n   All through music and me!  For think, had I painted the whole,\n     Why, there it had stood, to see, nor the process so wonder-worth.\n   Had I written the same, made verse--still, effect proceeds from cause,\n     Ye know why the forms are fair, ye hear how the tale is told;\n   It is all triumphant art, but art in obedience to laws,\n     Painter and poet are proud, in the artist-list enrolled:--\n\n\n     7.\n\n   But here is the finger of God, a flash of the will that can,\n     Existent behind all laws:  that made them, and, lo, they are!\n   And I know not if, save in this, such gift be allowed to man,\n     That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star.\n   Consider it well:  each tone of our scale in itself is naught;\n     It is everywhere in the world--loud, soft, and all is said:\n   Give it to me to use!  I mix it with two in my thought,\n     And, there!  Ye have heard and seen:  consider and bow the head!\n\n\n     8.\n\n   Well, it is gone at last, the palace of music I reared;\n     Gone! and the good tears start, the praises that come too slow;\n   For one is assured at first, one scarce can say that he feared,\n     That he even gave it a thought, the gone thing was to go.\n   Never to be again!  But many more of the kind\n     As good, nay, better perchance:  is this your comfort to me?\n   To me, who must be saved because I cling with my mind\n     To the same, same self, same love, same God:  ay, what was, shall be.\n\n\n     9.\n\n   Therefore to whom turn I but to thee, the ineffable Name?\n     Builder and maker, thou, of houses not made with hands!\n   What, have fear of change from thee who art ever the same?\n     Doubt that thy power can fill the heart that thy power expands?\n   There shall never be one lost good!  What was, shall live as before;\n     The evil is null, is naught, is silence implying sound;\n   What was good, shall be good, with, for evil, so much good more;\n     On the earth the broken arcs; in the heaven, a perfect round.\n\n\n     10.\n\n   All we have willed or hoped or dreamed of good, shall exist;\n     Not its semblance, but itself; no beauty, nor good, nor power\n   Whose voice has gone forth, but each survives for the melodist,\n     When eternity affirms the conception of an hour.\n   The high that proved too high, the heroic for earth too hard,\n     The passion that left the ground to lose itself in the sky,\n   Are music sent up to God by the lover and the bard;\n     Enough that he heard it once:  we shall hear it by-and-by.\n\n\n     11.\n\n   And what is our failure here but a triumph’s evidence\n     For the fulness of the days?  Have we withered or agonized?\n   Why else was the pause prolonged but that singing might issue thence?\n     Why rushed the discords in, but that harmony should be prized?\n   Sorrow is hard to bear, and doubt is slow to clear,\n     Each sufferer says his say, his scheme of the weal and woe:\n   But God has a few of us whom he whispers in the ear;\n     The rest may reason and welcome; ‘tis we musicians know.\n\n--\nSt. 11.  And what is our failure here:  “As long as effort\nis directed to the highest, that aim, though it is out of reach,\nis the standard of hope.  The existence of a capacity,\ncherished and quickened, is a pledge that it will find scope.\nThe punishment of the man who has fixed all his thoughts upon earth,\na punishment felt on reflection to be overwhelming in view of\npossibilities of humanity, is the completest gratification of desires\nunworthily limited:--\n\n               “‘Thou art shut\n     Out of the heaven of spirit; glut\n     Thy sense upon the world:  ‘tis thine\n     For ever--take it!’  (‘Easter Day’, xx.).\n\nOn the other hand, the soul which has found in success not rest\nbut a starting-point, which refuses to see in the first-fruits\nof a partial victory the fulness of its rightful triumph,\nhas ever before it a sustaining and elevating vision:--\n\n                         “‘What stops my despair?\n     This:--‘tis not what man Does which exalts him, but what man\n               Would do!’  (‘Saul’, 18).\n\n     “‘What I aspired to be,\n     And was not, comforts me;\n     A brute I might have been, but would not sink i’ the scale.’”\n           (‘Rabbi Ben Ezra’, 7).--Rev. Prof. Westcott on Browning’s\n          View of Life (‘Browning Soc. Papers’, iv., 405, 406).\n\n\n      12.\n\n    Well, it is earth with me; silence resumes her reign:\n      I will be patient and proud, and soberly acquiesce.\n    Give me the keys.  I feel for the common chord again,\n      Sliding by semitones, till I sink to the minor,--yes,\n    And I blunt it into a ninth, and I stand on alien ground,\n      Surveying a while the heights I rolled from into the deep;\n    Which, hark, I have dared and done, for my resting-place is found,\n      The C Major of this life:  so, now I will try to sleep.\n\n\n\n\n    “Touch him ne’er so lightly.”\n\n    {Epilogue to Dramatic Idyls.

           {40}\n     We merely kept a governor for form,\n     While this man walked about and took account\n     Of all thought, said and acted, then went home,\n     And wrote it fully to our Lord the King\n     Who has an itch to know things, he knows why,\n     And reads them in his bedroom of a night.\n     Oh, you might smile! there wanted not a touch,\n     A tang of. . .well, it was not wholly ease,\n     As back into your mind the man’s look came.\n     Stricken in years a little, such a brow                 {50}\n     His eyes had to live under!--clear as flint\n     On either side o’ the formidable nose\n     Curved, cut and colored like an eagle’s claw.\n     Had he to do with A.’s surprising fate?\n     When altogether old B. disappeared,\n     And young C. got his mistress,--was’t our friend,\n     His letter to the King, that did it all?\n     What paid the bloodless man for so much pains?\n     Our Lord the King has favorites manifold,\n     And shifts his ministry some once a month;              {60}\n     Our city gets new governors at whiles,--\n     But never word or sign, that I could hear,\n     Notified, to this man about the streets,\n     The King’s approval of those letters conned\n     The last thing duly at the dead of night.\n     Did the man love his office?

It must be understood\n that the poet addressed has written a long poem under this title,\n and a brother-poet, while admitting that it contains “true thoughts,\n good thoughts, thoughts fit to treasure up”, raises the objection\n that they are naked, instead of being draped, as they should be,\n in sights and sounds.\n--\n\n\n\n     Stop playing, poet!  May a brother speak?\n     ‘Tis you speak, that’s your error.  Song’s our art:\n     Whereas you please to speak these naked thoughts\n     Instead of draping them in sights and sounds.\n   --True thoughts, good thoughts, thoughts fit to treasure up!\n     But why such long prolusion and display,\n     Such turning and adjustment of the harp,\n     And taking it upon your breast, at length,\n     Only to speak dry words across its strings?\n     Stark-naked thought is in request enough:               {10}\n     Speak prose and hollo it till Europe hears!\n     The six-foot Swiss tube, braced about with bark,\n     Which helps the hunter’s voice from Alp to Alp--\n     Exchange our harp for that,--who hinders you?\n     But here’s your fault; grown men want thought, you think;\n     Thought’s what they mean by verse, and seek in verse;\n     Boys seek for images and melody,\n     Men must have reason--so, you aim at men.\n     Quite otherwise!

German Boehme:  Jacob Boehme (or Behmen), a shoemaker\nand a famous theosophist, b. 1575, at Old Seidenberg,\na village near Goerlitz; d. 1624.  The 24th verse of the poem,\n“He noticed all at once that plants could speak”, may refer to\na remarkable experience of Boehme, related in Dr. Hans Lassen Martensen’s\n‘Jacob Boehme:  his life and teaching, or studies in theosophy:\ntranslated from the Danish by T. Rhys Evans’, London, 1885:\n“Sitting one day in his room, his eye fell upon a burnished pewter dish,\nwhich reflected the sunshine with such marvellous splendor\nthat he fell into an inward ecstasy, and it seemed to him as if\nhe could now look into the principles and deepest foundations of things.\nHe believed that it was only a fancy, and in order to banish it\nfrom his mind he went out upon the green.  But here he remarked\nthat he gazed into the very heart of things, the very herbs and grass,\nand that actual nature harmonized with what he had inwardly seen.”\n Martensen, in his biography, follows that by Frankenberg,\nin which the experience may be given more in detail.\n\n37-40.  him of Halberstadt, John:  “It is not a thinker like Boehme,\nwho will compensate us for the lost summer of our life; but a magician\nlike John of Halberstadt, who can, at any moment, conjure roses up.”\n\n“The ‘magic’ symbolized, is that of genuine poetry; but the magician,\nor ‘Mage’, is an historical person; and the special feat imputed to him\nwas recorded of other magicians in the Middle Ages, if not of himself.\n‘Johannes Teutonicus, a canon of Halberstadht in Germany,\nafter he had performed a number of prestigious feats almost incredible,\nwas transported by the Devil in the likeness of a black horse,\nand was both seen and heard upon one and the same Christmas day,\nto say mass in Halberstadht, in Mayntz, and in Cologne’\n(‘Heywood’s Hierarchy’, Bk.

The ‘prestigious feat’\nof causing flowers to appear in winter, was a common one.”\n --Mrs. Sutherland Orr’s ‘Handbook to the works of Robert Browning’,\np. 209.\n\nIt may be said that the advice given in this poem, Browning has not\nsufficiently followed in his own poetry.  On this point, a writer in\nthe ‘British Quarterly Review’ (Vol. 23, p. 162) justly remarks:\n“Browning’s thought is always that of a poet.  Subtle, nimble,\nand powerful as is the intellect, and various as is the learning,\nall is manifested through the imagination, and comes forth\nshaped and tinted by it.  Thus, even in the foregoing passages\n{cited from ‘Transcendentalism’ and ‘Bishop Blougram’s Apology’},\nwhere the matter is almost as purely as it can be the produce of\nthe mere understanding, it is still evident that the method of\nthe thought is poetic.  The notions take the form of images.\nFor example, the poet means to say that Prose is a good\nand mighty vehicle in its way, but that it is not Poetry;\nand how does the conception shape itself in his mind?  Why,\nin an image.  All at once it is not Prose that is thought about,\nbut a huge six-foot speaking-trumpet braced round with bark,\nthrough which the Swiss hunters help their voices from Alp to Alp--\nPoetry, on the other hand, being no such big and blaring instrument,\nbut a harp taken to the breast of youth and swept by ecstatic fingers.\nAnd so with the images of Boehme and his book, and John of Halberstadt\nwith his magic rose--still a concrete body to enshrine\nan abstract meaning.”\n\n\n\n\nApparent Failure.\n\n“We shall soon lose a celebrated building.”--Paris Newspaper.\n\n\n\n       1.\n\n     No, for I’ll save it!

The original reading of the 3d verse was, “I, who saw Power,\nSHALL see Love perfect too.”  The change has cleared up a difficulty.\nThe All-Great is now to me, in my age, the All-Loving too.\nMaker, remake, complete:  there seems to be an anticipation here\nof the metaphor of the Potter’s wheel, in stanzas 25-32, and see Jer. 18:4.\n\n\n       11.\n\n     For pleasant is this flesh;\n     Our soul, in its rose-mesh\n     Pulled ever to the earth, still yearns for rest:\n     Would we some prize might hold\n     To match those manifold\n     Possessions of the brute,--gain most, as we did best!\n\n\n       12.\n\n     Let us not always say\n     “Spite of this flesh to-day\n     I strove, made head, gained ground upon the whole!”\n      As the bird wings and sings,\n     Let us cry “All good things\n     Are ours, nor soul helps flesh more, now, than flesh helps soul!”\n\n\n       13.\n\n     Therefore I summon age\n     To grant youth’s heritage,\n     Life’s struggle having so far reached its term:\n     Thence shall I pass, approved\n     A man, for aye removed\n     From the developed brute; a God though in the germ.\n\n--\nSt. 13.  Thence shall I pass, etc.:  It will be observed that\nhere and in some of the following stanzas, the Rabbi speaks\nin the person of youth; so youth should say to itself.\n\n\n       14.\n\n     And I shall thereupon\n     Take rest, ere I be gone\n     Once more on my adventure brave and new:\n     Fearless and unperplexed,\n     When I wage battle next,\n     What weapons to select, what armor to indue.\n\n\n       15.\n\n     Youth ended, I shall try\n     My gain or loss thereby;\n     Leave the fire ashes, what survives is gold:\n     And I shall weigh the same,\n     Give life its praise or blame:\n     Young, all lay in dispute; I shall know, being old.\n\n\n       16.\n\n     For, note when evening shuts,\n     A certain moment cuts\n     The deed off, calls the glory from the gray:\n     A whisper from the west\n     Shoots--“Add this to the rest,\n     Take it and try its worth:  here dies another day.”\n\n\n       17.\n\n     So, still within this life,\n     Though lifted o’er its strife,\n     Let me discern, compare, pronounce at last,\n     “This rage was right i’ the main,\n     That acquiescence vain:\n     The Future I may face now I have proved the Past.”\n\n\n       18.\n\n     For more is not reserved\n     To man, with soul just nerved\n     To act to-morrow what he learns to-day:\n     Here, work enough to watch\n     The Master work, and catch\n     Hints of the proper craft, tricks of the tool’s true play.\n\n\n       19.\n\n     As it was better, youth\n     Should strive, through acts uncouth,\n     Toward making, than repose on aught found made:\n     So, better, age, exempt\n     From strife, should know, than tempt\n     Further.

That this is not to be confounded\nwith the accentuated ‘De, meaning BUT’, was the ‘doctrine’\nwhich the Grammarian bequeathed to those capable of receiving it.--\nI am, sir, yours obediently, R.

Lazarus therefore,\nwhile he moves in the world, has lost all sense of proportion\nin things about him, all measure of and faculty of dealing with that\nwhich sways his fellows.  He has no power or will to win them\nto his faith, but he simply stands among men as a patient witness\nof the overwhelming reality of the divine:  a witness whose authority\nis confessed, even against his inclination, by the student of nature,\nwho turns again and again to the phenomenon which he affects\nto disparage.\n\n“In this crucial example Browning shows how the exclusive dominance\nof the spirit destroys the fulness of human life, its uses and powers,\nwhile it leaves a passive life, crowned with an unearthly beauty.\nOn the other hand, he shows in his study of Cleon that\nthe richest results of earth in art and speculation,\nand pleasure and power, are unable to remove from life the desolation\nof final gloom. . . .  The contrast is of the deepest significance.\nThe Jewish peasant endures earth, being in possession of heaven:\nthe Greek poet, in possession of earth, feels that heaven,\nsome future state,\n\n     ‘Unlimited in capability\n     For joy, as this is in desire for joy’,\n\nis a necessity for man; but no,\n\n     ‘Zeus has not yet revealed it; and alas,\n     He must have done so, were it possible!’\n\nBut we must not pause to follow out the contrast into details.\nIt is enough to see broadly that flesh and spirit each claim recognition\nin connection with their proper spheres, in order that the present life\nmay bear its true result.”--Rev.

This burden is not yet wholly removed\nfrom them; and to this day, several times in the course of a year,\na Jewish congregation is gathered together in the church of S. Angelo\nin Pescheria, and constrained to listen to a homily from a Dominican friar,\nto whom, unless his zeal have eaten up his good feelings\nand his good taste, the ceremony must be as painful as to his hearers.\nIn the same spirit of vulgar persecution, there is upon the gable\nof a church, opposite one of the gates of the Ghetto, a fresco painting\nof the Crucifixion, and, underneath, an inscription in Hebrew and Latin,\nfrom the 2d and 3d verses of the 65th chapter of Isaiah--\n‘I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people,\nwhich walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;\na people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face.’”\n --George S.

Ere I tell, ere thou speak,\n Kiss my cheek, wish me well!”  Then I wished it, and did kiss his cheek.\n And he, “Since the King, O my friend, for thy countenance sent,\n Neither drunken nor eaten have we; nor until from his tent\n Thou return with the joyful assurance the King liveth yet,\n Shall our lip with the honey be bright, with the water be wet.\n For out of the black mid-tent’s silence, a space of three days,\n Not a sound hath escaped to thy servants, of prayer nor of praise,\n To betoken that Saul and the spirit have ended their strife,\n And that, faint in his triumph, the monarch sinks back upon life.         {10}\n\n\n   2.\n\n “Yet now my heart leaps, O beloved!  God’s child with his dew\n On thy gracious gold hair, and those lilies still living and blue\n Just broken to twine round thy harp-strings, as if no wild heat\n Were now raging to torture the desert!”\n\n\n   3.\n\n                                          Then I, as was meet,\n Knelt down to the God of my fathers, and rose on my feet,\n And ran o’er the sand burnt to powder.  The tent was unlooped;\n I pulled up the spear that obstructed, and under I stooped;\n Hands and knees on the slippery grass-patch, all withered and gone,\n That extends to the second enclosure, I groped my way on                  {20}\n Till I felt where the foldskirts fly open.  Then once more I prayed,\n And opened the foldskirts and entered, and was not afraid\n But spoke, “Here is David, thy servant!”  And no voice replied.\n At the first I saw naught but the blackness; but soon I descried\n A something more black than the blackness--the vast, the upright\n Main prop which sustains the pavilion:  and slow into sight\n Grew a figure against it, gigantic and blackest of all.\n Then a sunbeam, that burst through the tent-roof, showed Saul.\n\n\n   4.\n\n He stood as erect as that tent-prop, both arms stretched out wide\n On the great cross-support in the centre, that goes to each side;         {30}\n He relaxed not a muscle, but hung there as, caught in his pangs\n And waiting his change, the king serpent all heavily hangs,\n Far away from his kind, in the pine, till deliverance come\n With the spring-time,--so agonized Saul, drear and stark, blind and dumb.\n\n\n   5.\n\n Then I tuned my harp,--took off the lilies we twine round its chords\n Lest they snap ‘neath the stress of the noontide--those sunbeams\n           like swords!\n And I first played the tune all our sheep know, as, one after one,\n So docile they come to the pen-door till folding be done.\n They are white, and untorn by the bushes, for lo, they have fed\n Where the long grasses stifle the water within the stream’s bed;          {40}\n And now one after one seeks its lodging, as star follows star\n Into eve and the blue far above us,--so blue and so far!\n\n\n   6.\n\n--Then the tune, for which quails on the cornland will each leave his mate\n To fly after the player; then, what makes the crickets elate\n Till for boldness they fight one another:  and then, what has weight\n To set the quick jerboa a-musing outside his sand house--\n There are none such as he for a wonder, half bird and half mouse!\n God made all the creatures and gave them our love and our fear,\n To give sign, we and they are his children, one family here.\n\n\n   7.\n\n Then I played the help-tune of our reapers, their wine-song, when hand    {50}\n Grasps at hand, eye lights eye in good friendship, and great hearts expand\n And grow one in the sense of this world’s life.--And then, the last song\n When the dead man is praised on his journey--“Bear, bear him along\n With his few faults shut up like dead flowerets!  Are balm seeds not here\n To console us?  The land has none left such as he on the bier.\n Oh, would we might keep thee, my brother!”--And then, the glad chant\n Of the marriage,--first go the young maidens, next, she whom we vaunt\n As the beauty, the pride of our dwelling.--And then, the great march\n Wherein man runs to man to assist him and buttress an arch\n Naught can break; who shall harm them, our friends?--Then,\n           the chorus intoned                                              {60}\n As the Levites go up to the altar in glory enthroned.\n But I stopped here:  for here in the darkness Saul groaned.\n\n\n   8.\n\n And I paused, held my breath in such silence, and listened apart;\n And the tent shook, for mighty Saul shuddered:  and sparkles ‘gan dart\n From the jewels that woke in his turban at once with a start\n All its lordly male-sapphires, and rubies courageous at heart.\n So the head:  but the body still moved not, still hung there erect.\n And I bent once again to my playing, pursued it unchecked,\n As I sang,--\n\n\n   9.\n\n               “Oh, our manhood’s prime vigor!  No spirit feels waste,\n Not a muscle is stopped in its playing nor sinew unbraced.                {70}\n Oh, the wild joys of living! the leaping from rock up to rock,\n The strong rending of boughs from the fir-tree, the cool silver shock\n Of the plunge in a pool’s living water, the hunt of the bear,\n And the sultriness showing the lion is couched in his lair.\n And the meal, the rich dates yellowed over with gold dust divine,\n And the locust-flesh steeped in the pitcher, the full draught of wine,\n And the sleep in the dried river-channel where bulrushes tell\n That the water was wont to go warbling so softly and well.\n How good is man’s life, the mere living! how fit to employ\n All the heart and the soul and the senses forever in joy!                 {80}\n Hast thou loved the white locks of thy father, whose sword thou didst guard\n When he trusted thee forth with the armies, for glorious reward?\n Didst thou see the thin hands of thy mother, held up as men sung\n The low song of the nearly departed, and hear her faint tongue\n Joining in while it could to the witness, ‘Let one more attest,\n I have lived, seen God’s hand through a lifetime, and all was for best!’\n Then they sung through their tears in strong triumph, not much,\n           but the rest.\n And thy brothers, the help and the contest, the working whence grew\n Such result as, from seething grape-bundles, the spirit strained true:\n And the friends of thy boyhood--that boyhood of wonder and hope,        {90}\n Present promise and wealth of the future beyond the eye’s scope,--\n Till lo, thou art grown to a monarch; a people is thine;\n And all gifts, which the world offers singly, on one head combine!\n On one head, all the beauty and strength, love and rage (like the throe\n That, a-work in the rock, helps its labor and lets the gold go)\n High ambition and deeds which surpass it, fame crowning them,--all\n Brought to blaze on the head of one creature--King Saul!”\n\n\n   10.\n\n And lo, with that leap of my spirit,--heart, hand, harp, and voice,\n Each lifting Saul’s name out of sorrow, each bidding rejoice\n Saul’s fame in the light it was made for--as when, dare I say,         {100}\n The Lord’s army, in rapture of service, strains through its array,\n And upsoareth the cherubim-chariot--“Saul!” cried I, and stopped,\n And waited the thing that should follow.  Then Saul, who hung propped\n By the tent’s cross-support in the centre, was struck by his name.\n Have ye seen when Spring’s arrowy summons goes right to the aim,\n And some mountain, the last to withstand her, that held (he alone,\n While the vale laughed in freedom and flowers) on a broad bust of stone\n A year’s snow bound about for a breastplate,--leaves grasp of the sheet?\n Fold on fold all at once it crowds thunderously down to his feet,\n And there fronts you, stark, black, but alive yet, your mountain of old, {110}\n With his rents, the successive bequeathings of ages untold--\n Yea, each harm got in fighting your battles, each furrow and scar\n Of his head thrust ‘twixt you and the tempest--all hail, there they are!\n--Now again to be softened with verdure, again hold the nest\n Of the dove, tempt the goat and its young to the green on his crest\n For their food in the ardors of summer.  One long shudder thrilled\n All the tent till the very air tingled, then sank and was stilled\n At the King’s self left standing before me, released and aware.\n What was gone, what remained?  All to traverse ‘twixt hope and despair.\n Death was past, life not come:  so he waited.  Awhile his right hand     {120}\n Held the brow, helped the eyes, left too vacant, forthwith to remand\n To their place what new objects should enter:  ‘twas Saul as before.\n I looked up and dared gaze at those eyes, nor was hurt any more\n Than by slow pallid sunsets in autumn, ye watch from the shore,\n At their sad level gaze o’er the ocean--a sun’s slow decline\n Over hills which, resolved in stern silence, o’erlap and intwine\n Base with base to knit strength more intensely:  so, arm folded arm\n O’er the chest whose slow heavings subsided.\n\n\n   11.\n\n                                               What spell or what charm\n (For, a while there was trouble within me), what next should I urge\n To sustain him where song had restored him?--Song filled to the verge  {130}\n His cup with the wine of this life, pressing all that it yields\n Of mere fruitage, the strength and the beauty:  beyond, on what fields,\n Glean a vintage more potent and perfect to brighten the eye\n And bring blood to the lip, and commend them the cup they put by?\n He saith, “It is good”; still he drinks not:  he lets me praise life,\n Gives assent, yet would die for his own part.\n\n\n   12.\n\n                                                Then fancies grew rife\n Which had come long ago on the pasture, when round me the sheep\n Fed in silence--above, the one eagle wheeled slow as in sleep;\n And I lay in my hollow and mused on the world that might lie\n ‘Neath his ken, though I saw but the strip ‘twixt the hill and the sky.  {140}\n And I laughed--“Since my days are ordained to be passed with my flocks,\n Let me people at least, with my fancies, the plains and the rocks,\n Dream the life I am never to mix with, and image the show\n Of mankind as they live in those fashions I hardly shall know!\n Schemes of life, its best rules and right uses, the courage that gains,\n And the prudence that keeps what men strive for.”  And now these old trains\n Of vague thought came again; I grew surer; so, once more the string\n Of my harp made response to my spirit, as thus--\n\n\n   13.\n\n                                                    “Yea, my King,”\n  I began--“thou dost well in rejecting mere comforts that spring\n From the mere mortal life held in common by man and by brute:            {150}\n In our flesh grows the branch of this life, in our soul it bears fruit.\n Thou hast marked the slow rise of the tree,--how its stem trembled first\n Till it passed the kid’s lip, the stag’s antler; then safely outburst\n The fan-branches all round; and thou mindest when these too, in turn\n Broke a-bloom and the palm-tree seemed perfect:  yet more was to learn,\n E’en the good that comes in with the palm-fruit.  Our dates shall we slight,\n When their juice brings a cure for all sorrow? or care for the plight\n Of the palm’s self whose slow growth produced them?  Not so! stem and branch\n Shall decay, nor be known in their place, while the palm-wine shall stanch\n Every wound of man’s spirit in winter.  I pour thee such wine.           {160}\n Leave the flesh to the fate it was fit for! the spirit be thine!\n By the spirit, when age shall o’ercome thee, thou still shalt enjoy\n More indeed, than at first when, inconscious, the life of a boy.\n Crush that life, and behold its wine running!  Each deed thou hast done\n Dies, revives, goes to work in the world; until e’en as the sun\n Looking down on the earth, though clouds spoil him, though tempests efface,\n Can find nothing his own deed produced not, must everywhere trace\n The results of his past summer-prime,--so, each ray of thy will,\n Every flash of thy passion and prowess, long over, shall thrill\n Thy whole people, the countless, with ardor, till they too give forth    {170}\n A like cheer to their sons:  who in turn, fill the South and the North\n With the radiance thy deed was the germ of.  Carouse in the past!\n But the license of age has its limit; thou diest at last.\n As the lion when age dims his eyeball, the rose at her height,\n So with man--so his power and his beauty forever take flight.\n No!  Again a long draught of my soul-wine!  Look forth o’er the years!\n Thou hast done now with eyes for the actual; begin with the seer’s!\n Is Saul dead?  In the depth of the vale make his tomb--bid arise\n A gray mountain of marble heaped four-square, till, built to the skies,\n Let it mark where the great First King slumbers:  whose fame would ye know?\n Up above see the rock’s naked face, where the record shall go            {181}\n In great characters cut by the scribe,--Such was Saul, so he did;\n With the sages directing the work, by the populace chid,--\n For not half, they’ll affirm, is comprised there!  Which fault to amend,\n In the grove with his kind grows the cedar, whereon they shall spend\n (See, in tablets ‘tis level before them) their praise, and record\n With the gold of the graver, Saul’s story,--the statesman’s great word\n Side by side with the poet’s sweet comment.  The river’s a-wave\n With smooth paper-reeds grazing each other when prophet-winds rave:\n So the pen gives unborn generations their due and their part             {190}\n In thy being!  Then, first of the mighty, thank God that thou art!”\n\n\n   14.\n\n And behold while I sang. . .but O Thou who didst grant me, that day,\n And, before it, not seldom hast granted thy help to essay,\n Carry on and complete an adventure,--my shield and my sword\n In that act where my soul was thy servant, thy word was my word,--\n Still be with me, who then at the summit of human endeavor\n And scaling the highest, man’s thought could, gazed hopeless as ever\n On the new stretch of heaven above me--till, mighty to save,\n Just one lift of thy hand cleared that distance--God’s throne from\n           man’s grave!\n Let me tell out my tale to its ending--my voice to my heart            {200}\n Which can scarce dare believe in what marvels last night I took part,\n As this morning I gather the fragments, alone with my sheep!\n And still fear lest the terrible glory evanish like sleep,\n For I wake in the gray dewy covert, while Hebron upheaves\n The dawn struggling with night on his shoulder, and Kidron retrieves\n Slow the damage of yesterday’s sunshine.\n\n\n   15.\n\n                                           I say then,--my song\n While I sang thus, assuring the monarch, and, ever more strong,\n Made a proffer of good to console him--he slowly resumed\n His old motions and habitudes kingly.  The right hand replumed\n His black locks to their wonted composure, adjusted the swathes          {210}\n Of his turban, and see--the huge sweat that his countenance bathes,\n He wipes off with the robe; and he girds now his loins as of yore,\n And feels slow for the armlets of price, with the clasp set before.\n He is Saul, ye remember in glory,--ere error had bent\n The broad brow from the daily communion; and still, though much spent\n Be the life and the bearing that front you, the same, God did choose,\n To receive what a man may waste, desecrate, never quite lose.\n So sank he along by the tent-prop, till, stayed by the pile\n Of his armor and war-cloak and garments, he leaned there awhile,\n And sat out my singing,--one arm round the tent-prop, to raise         {220}\n His bent head, and the other hung slack--till I touched on the praise\n I foresaw from all men in all time, to the man patient there;\n And thus ended, the harp falling forward.  Then first I was ‘ware\n That he sat, as I say, with my head just above his vast knees\n Which were thrust out on each side around me, like oak-roots which please\n To encircle a lamb when it slumbers.  I looked up to know\n If the best I could do had brought solace:  he spoke not, but slow\n Lifted up the hand slack at his side, till he laid it with care\n Soft and grave, but in mild settled will, on my brow:  through my hair\n The large fingers were pushed, and he bent back my head, with kind power--\n All my face back, intent to peruse it, as men do a flower.               {231}\n Thus held he me there with his great eyes that scrutinized mine--\n And oh, all my heart how it loved him! but where was the sign?\n I yearned--“Could I help thee, my father, inventing a bliss,\n I would add, to that life of the past, both the future and this;\n I would give thee new life altogether, as good, ages hence,\n As this moment,--had love but the warrant, love’s heart to dispense!”\n\n\n   16.\n\n Then the truth came upon me.

The poet probably did not think\nof any particular persecution.\n--\n\n     I at the head, and Xanthus at the feet,\n     With Valens and the Boy, had lifted him,      {30}\n     And brought him from the chamber in the depths,\n     And laid him in the light where we might see:\n     For certain smiles began about his mouth,\n     And his lids moved, presageful of the end.\n\n     Beyond, and half way up the mouth o’ the cave,     {35}\n     The Bactrian convert, having his desire,\n     Kept watch, and made pretence to graze a goat\n     That gave us milk, on rags of various herb,\n     Plantain and quitch, the rocks’ shade keeps alive:\n     So that if any thief or soldier passed             {40}\n     (Because the persecution was aware),\n     Yielding the goat up promptly with his life,\n     Such man might pass on, joyful at a prize,\n     Nor care to pry into the cool o’ the cave.\n     Outside was all noon and the burning blue.         {45}\n\n--\n36.  the Bactrian convert:  in vv. 649, 650, he is spoken of as\n“but a wild childish man, and could not write nor speak,\nbut only loved.”  Bactria was a kingdom in Central Asia;\nthe modern name is Balkh {a district in northern Afghanistan as of 1995}.\nhaving his desire:  as a new convert, the simple man was eager to serve,\neven unto death.\n\n41.  aware:  on the lookout; exercising a strict espionage.\n--\n\n     “Here is wine”, answered Xanthus,--dropped a drop;\n     I stooped and placed the lap of cloth aright,\n     Then chafed his right hand, and the Boy his left:\n     But Valens had bethought him, and produced\n     And broke a ball of nard, and made perfume.        {50}\n     Only, he did--not so much wake, as--turn\n     And smile a little, as a sleeper does\n     If any dear one call him, touch his face--\n     And smiles and loves, but will not be disturbed.\n\n     Then Xanthus said a prayer, but still he slept:    {55}\n     It is the Xanthus that escaped to Rome,\n     Was burned, and could not write the chronicle.\n\n     Then the Boy sprang up from his knees, and ran,\n     Stung by the splendor of a sudden thought,\n     And fetched the seventh plate of graven lead       {60}\n     Out of the secret chamber, found a place,\n     Pressing with finger on the deeper dints,\n     And spoke, as ‘twere his mouth proclaiming first,\n     “I am the Resurrection and the Life.”\n\n--\n60.  the seventh plate of graven lead:  one of the plates on which\nJohn’s Gospel was graven.  It contained, it appears, the 11th chapter,\nin which Jesus says to Martha, 25th verse, “I am the Resurrection\nand the Life.”  The Boy uttered the words with such expression\nas ‘twere HIS mouth first proclaiming them.\n--\n\n     Whereat he opened his eyes wide at once,      {65}\n     And sat up of himself, and looked at us;\n     And thenceforth nobody pronounced a word:\n     Only, outside, the Bactrian cried his cry\n     Like the lone desert-bird that wears the ruff,\n     As signal we were safe, from time to time.    {70}\n\n--\n69.  the lone desert-bird:  the ruff may possibly be referred to.\nSee Webster, s.v.\n--\n\n     First he said, “If a man declared to me,\n     This my son Valens, this my other son,\n     Were James and Peter,--nay, declared as well\n     This lad was very John,--I could believe!\n   --Could, for a moment, doubtlessly believe:       {75}\n     So is myself withdrawn into my depths,\n     The soul retreated from the perished brain\n     Whence it was wont to feel and use the world\n     Through these dull members, done with long ago.\n     Yet I myself remain; I feel myself:                {80}\n     And there is nothing lost.

The supposed narrator, Pamphylax, gives in these\nbracketed verses, on the authority of an imagined Theotypas,\na doctrine John was wont to teach, of the trinal unity of man--\nthe third “person” of which unity, “what Is”, being man’s essential,\nabsolute nature.  The dying John is represented as having won his way\nto the Kingdom of the “what Is”, the Kingdom of eternal truth\nwithin himself.  In Luke 17:20-21, we read:  “And when he was\ndemanded of the Pharisees, when the Kingdom of God should come,\nhe answered them and said, The Kingdom of God cometh not with observation:\nneither shall they say, Lo here! or, Lo there! for, behold,\nthe Kingdom of God is within you.”  In harmony with which,\nParacelsus is made to say, in Browning’s poem, “Truth is within ourselves;\n. . . there is an inmost centre in us all, where truth abides in fulness”;\netc.  See pp. 24 and 25 of this volume.  {In this etext, see Chapter I,\n‘The Spiritual Ebb and Flow, etc.’, of the Introduction.\nExcerpt is shortly before the poem ‘Popularity’.}  “Life,\nyou’ve granted me, develops from within.  But INNERMOST OF THE INMOST,\nMOST INTERIOR OF THE INTERNE, GOD CLAIMS HIS OWN,\nDIVINE HUMANITY RENEWING NATURE” (Mrs. Browning’s ‘Aurora Leigh’).\nMrs. M. G. Glazebrook, in her paper on ‘A Death in the Desert’,\nread at the 48th meeting of the Browning Society, Feb. 25th, 1887,\nparaphrases these lines:  “The first and lowest {soul} is that\nwhich has to do with earth and corporeal things, the animal soul,\nwhich receives primary sensations and is the immediate cause of action\n--‘what Does’.  The second is the intellect, and has its seat\nin the brain:  it is superior to the first, but dependent on it,\nsince it receives as material the actual experience which\nthe animal soul supplies; it is the feeling, thinking, willing soul\n--‘what Knows’.  The third, and highest, is the spirit of man,\nthe very principle of life, the divine element in man linking him\nto God, which is self-subsistent and therefore independent of\nsensation and knowledge, but nevertheless makes use of them,\nand gives them existence and energy--‘what Is’.”\n --\n\n     And then, “A stick, once fire from end to end;    {105}\n     Now, ashes save the tip that holds a spark!\n     Yet, blow the spark, it runs back, spreads itself\n     A little where the fire was:  thus I urge\n     The soul that served me, till it task once more\n     What ashes of my brain have kept their shape,     {110}\n     And these make effort on the last o’ the flesh,\n     Trying to taste again the truth of things”--\n     (He smiled)--“their very superficial truth;\n     As that ye are my sons, that it is long\n     Since James and Peter had release by death,       {115}\n     And I am only he, your brother John,\n     Who saw and heard, and could remember all.\n     Remember all!  It is not much to say.\n     What if the truth broke on me from above\n     As once and oft-times?  Such might hap again:     {120}\n     Doubtlessly He might stand in presence here,\n     With head wool-white, eyes, flame, and feet like brass,\n     The sword and the seven stars, as I have seen--\n     I who now shudder only and surmise\n     ‘How did your brother bear that sight and live?’  {125}\n\n--\n113.  superficial truth:  phenomenal, relative truth;\nthat which is arrived at through the senses, and belongs to the domain\nof the “what Knows”.  Essential, absolute truth can be known only\nthrough a response thereto of the essential, the absolute,\nthe “what Is”, in man’s nature.  John has attained to a measure\nof absolute truth, and smiles on reverting to the very superficial\ntruth of things.\n\n121-123.  See The Revelation of St. John, chap. 1.\n\n125.  your brother:  he means himself, of course.\n--\n\n     “If I live yet, it is for good, more love\n     Through me to men:  be naught but ashes here\n     That keep awhile my semblance, who was John,--\n     Still, when they scatter, there is left on earth\n     No one alive who knew (consider this!)                {130}\n   --Saw with his eyes and handled with his hands\n     That which was from the first, the Word of Life.\n     How will it be when none more saith ‘I saw’?\n\n     “Such ever was love’s way:  to rise, it stoops.\n     Since I, whom Christ’s mouth taught, was bidden teach, {135}\n     I went, for many years, about the world,\n     Saying, ‘It was so; so I heard and saw’,\n     Speaking as the case asked:  and men believed.\n     Afterward came the message to myself\n     In Patmos isle; I was not bidden teach.                {140}\n     But simply listen, take a book and write,\n     Nor set down other than the given word.\n     With nothing left to my arbitrament\n     To choose or change:  I wrote, and men believed.\n     Then, for my time grew brief, no message more,         {145}\n     No call to write again, I found a way,\n     And, reasoning from my knowledge, merely taught\n     Men should, for love’s sake, in love’s strength, believe;\n     Or I would pen a letter to a friend,\n     And urge the same as friend, nor less nor more:        {150}\n     Friends said I reasoned rightly, and believed.\n     But at the last, why, I seemed left alive\n     Like a sea-jelly weak on Patmos strand,\n     To tell dry sea-beach gazers how I fared\n     When there was mid-sea, and the mighty things;         {155}\n     Left to repeat, ‘I saw, I heard, I knew’,\n     And go all over the old ground again,\n     With Antichrist already in the world,\n     And many Antichrists, who answered prompt\n     ‘Am I not Jasper as thyself art John?                  {160}\n     Nay, young, whereas through age thou mayest forget:\n     Wherefore, explain, or how shall we believe?’\n     I never thought to call down fire on such,\n     Or, as in wonderful and early days,\n     Pick up the scorpion, tread the serpent dumb;          {165}\n     But patient stated much of the Lord’s life\n     Forgotten or misdelivered, and let it work:\n     Since much that at the first, in deed and word,\n     Lay simply and sufficiently exposed,\n     Had grown (or else my soul was grown to match,         {170}\n     Fed through such years, familiar with such light,\n     Guarded and guided still to see and speak)\n     Of new significance and fresh result;\n     What first were guessed as points, I now knew stars,\n     And named them in the Gospel I have writ.              {175}\n     For men said, ‘It is getting long ago:\n     Where is the promise of His coming?’--asked\n     These young ones in their strength, as loth to wait,\n     Of me who, when their sires were born, was old.\n     I, for I loved them, answered, joyfully,               {180}\n     Since I was there, and helpful in my age;\n     And, in the main, I think such men believed.\n     Finally, thus endeavoring, I fell sick.\n     Ye brought me here, and I supposed the end,\n     And went to sleep with one thought that, at least,     {185}\n     Though the whole earth should lie in wickedness,\n     We had the truth, might leave the rest to God.\n     Yet now I wake in such decrepitude\n     As I had slidden down and fallen afar,\n     Past even the presence of my former self,              {190}\n     Grasping the while for stay at facts which snap,\n     Till I am found away from my own world,\n     Feeling for foot-hold through a blank profound,\n     Along with unborn people in strange lands,\n     Who say--I hear said or conceive they say--       {195}\n     ‘Was John at all, and did he say he saw?\n     Assure us, ere we ask what he might see!’\n\n--\n156.  I saw, I heard, I knew:  expressions which occur throughout\nJohn’s Revelation.\n\n188-197.  The poet provides, in these lines, for the prophetic character\nof John’s discourse, its solution of the difficulties destined to beset\nChristianity in the future, and especially of those which have been\nraised in our own times.  The historical bulwarks which the Strausses\nand the Renans have endeavored to destroy, Christianity,\nin its essential, absolute character, its adaptiveness to\nspiritual vitality, and the wants of the soul, can do without.\nIndeed, there will be much gained when the historical character\nof Christianity is generally disregarded.  Its impregnable fortress,\nnamely, the Personality, Jesus Christ, will remain, and mankind\nwill forever seek and find refuge in it.  Arthur Symons,\nin his ‘Introduction to the Study of Browning’, remarks: . . .\"it is as\na piece of ratiocination--suffused, indeed, with imagination--\nthat the poem seems to have its raison d’etre.  The bearing of\nthis argument on contemporary theories, may to some appear a merit,\nto others a blemish.  To make the dying John refute Strauss or Renan,\nhandling their propositions with admirable dialectical skill,\nis certainly, on the face of it, somewhat hazardous.  But I can see\nno real incongruity in imputing to the seer of Patmos\na prophetic insight into the future--no real inconsequence\nin imagining the opponent of Cerinthus spending his last breath\nin the defence of Christian truth against a foreseen scepticism.”\n --\n\n     “And how shall I assure them?

St. Paul and St. Luke were asserted to have spoken\nand written against Ebionites.  The ‘Apostolical Constitutions’ (vi. c. 6)\ntraced them back to Apostolic times; Theodoret (Haer. fab.

He represented Jesus as having not been born\nof a virgin, but as being the son of Joseph and Mary according to\nthe ordinary course of human generation, while he nevertheless\nwas more righteous, prudent, and wise than other men.  Moreover,\nafter his baptism, Christ descended upon him in the form of a dove\nfrom the Supreme Ruler, and that then he proclaimed the unknown Father,\nand performed miracles.  But at last Christ departed from Jesus,\nand that then Jesus suffered and rose again, while Christ\nremained impassible, inasmuch as he was a spiritual being.”\n ‘The Writings of Irenaeus, transl. by Rev.

What is the doubt, my brothers?:  He addresses his brothers\nof the far future.  The eight following verses are very beautiful.\n\n362-365.  The question, “Where is the promise of His coming?”\n asked in John’s own day, gives place in the far future to which the ken\nof the dying Apostle extends, to the question whether God was indeed\nrevealed in Christ, ‘As Power, as Love, as Influencing Soul’,\nor whether, man having already love in himself, Christ were not\na mere projection from man’s inmost mind (v. 383)?  If so there is\nnothing to fall back on but force, or natural law.  This anticipated\nquestioning and reasoning extends from v. 370 to v. 421.\n--\n\n     “Quick, for time presses, tell the whole mind out,\n     And let us ask and answer and be saved!\n     My book speaks on, because it cannot pass;\n     One listens quietly, nor scoffs but pleads\n     ‘Here is a tale of things done ages since:             {370}\n     What truth was ever told the second day?\n     Wonders, that would prove doctrine, go for naught.\n     Remains the doctrine, love; well, we must love,\n     And what we love most, power and love in one,\n     Let us acknowledge on the record here,                 {375}\n     Accepting these in Christ:  must Christ then be?\n     Has He been?

And let us ask and answer:  John’s talk, it must be understood,\nis with future people, not with the attendants.\n\n368.  My book speaks on:  that is, to people of all futures,\nbecause it cannot pass away.\n\n371.  What truth, etc.:  that is, truth is soon perverted, obscured,\nand often turned into positive untruth.\n\n372.  Wonders, that would prove doctrine:  that is, whose purpose was\nto prove.\n\n385.  Comes to be considered as something outside of,\nand distinct from, himself.\n--\n\n     “Nay, do not give me wine, for I am strong,\n     But place my gospel where I put my hands.\n\n     “I say that man was made to grow, not stop;\n     That help, he needed once, and needs no more,               {425}\n     Having grown but an inch by, is withdrawn:\n     For he hath new needs, and new helps to these.\n     This imports solely, man should mount on each\n     New height in view; the help whereby he mounts,\n     The ladder-rung his foot has left, may fall,                {430}\n     Since all things suffer change save God the Truth.\n     Man apprehends Him newly at each stage\n     Whereat earth’s ladder drops, its service done;\n     And nothing shall prove twice what once was proved.\n     You stick a garden-plot with ordered twigs                  {435}\n     To show inside lie germs of herbs unborn,\n     And check the careless step would spoil their birth;\n     But when herbs wave, the guardian twigs may go,\n     Since should ye doubt of virtues, question kinds,\n     It is no longer for old twigs ye look,                      {440}\n     Which proved once underneath lay store of seed,\n     But to the herb’s self, by what light ye boast,\n     For what fruit’s signs are.

Here John’s answer begins to the questioning and reasoning\ncontained in vv. 370-421.\n\nIn vv. 424-434, is contained a favorite teaching of Browning.\nIt appears in various forms throughout his poetry.  See the quotation\nfrom ‘Luria’, p. 38.\n\n428.  This imports solely:  this is the one all important thing.\n\n428-430.  A similar comparison is used in ‘Julius Caesar’, A. II.,\nS. I., 22-27:\n\n          . . .\"lowliness is young ambition’s ladder,\n     Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;\n     But when he once attains the upmost round,\n     He then unto the ladder turns his back,\n     Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees\n     By which he did ascend.”\n\n452.  This might be pagan teaching:  that is, even pagan teaching\nmight go so far as this.\n--\n\n     “I say, that as the babe, you feed awhile,\n     Becomes a boy and fit to feed himself,\n     So, minds at first must be spoon-fed with truth:  {455}\n     When they can eat, babe’s nurture is withdrawn.\n     I fed the babe whether it would or no:\n     I bid the boy or feed himself or starve.\n     I cried once, ‘That ye may believe in Christ,\n     Behold this blind man shall receive his sight!’   {460}\n     I cry now, ‘Urgest thou, FOR I AM SHREWD,\n     AND SMILE AT STORIES HOW JOHN’S WORD COULD CURE--\n     REPEAT THAT MIRACLE AND TAKE MY FAITH?’\n     I say, that miracle was duly wrought\n     When, save for it, no faith was possible.         {465}\n     Whether a change were wrought i’ the shows o’ the world,\n     Whether the change came from our minds which see\n     Of shows o’ the world so much as and no more\n     Than God wills for His purpose,--(what do I\n     See now, suppose you, there where you see rock    {470}\n     Round us?)--I know not; such was the effect,\n     So faith grew, making void more miracles\n     Because too much:  they would compel, not help.\n     I say, the acknowledgment of God in Christ\n     Accepted by thy reason, solves for thee           {475}\n     All questions in the earth and out of it,\n     And has so far advanced thee to be wise.\n     Wouldst thou unprove this to re-prove the proved?\n     In life’s mere minute, with power to use that proof,\n     Leave knowledge and revert to how it sprung?      {480}\n     Thou hast it; use it and forthwith, or die!\n\n--\n472.  So faith grew, making void more miracles:  the outward\nmanifestations of spiritual powers (du/namis, ‘power’, ‘act of power’,\nand shmei^on, ‘sign’, ‘token’, are the original words in the N.

And see the grand dying speech\nof Paracelsus, which concludes Browning’s poem.\n\n554.  “A law of nature means nothing to Mr. Browning if it does not mean\nthe immanence of power, and will, and love.  He can pass\nwith ready sympathy into the mystical feeling of the East,\nwhere in the unclouded sky, in the torrent of noonday light,\nGod is so near\n\n                    ‘He glows above\n     With scarce an intervention, presses close\n     And palpitatingly, His soul o’er ours.’\n\nBut the wisdom of a Western ‘savant’ who in his superior intellectuality\nreplaces the will of God by the blind force of nature,\nseems to Mr. Browning to be science falsely so called,\na new ignorance founded upon knowledge,\n\n     ‘A lamp’s death when, replete with oil, it chokes.’\n\nTo this effect argues the prophet John in ‘A Death in the Desert’,\nanticipating with the deep prevision of a dying man the doubts\nand questionings of modern days.  And in the third of those\nremarkable poems which form the epilogue of the ‘Dramatis Personae’,\nthe whole world rises in the speaker’s imagination into one vast\nspiritual temple, in which voices of singers, and swell of trumpets,\nand cries of priests are heard going up to God no less truly\nthan in the old Jewish worship, while the face of Christ,\ninstinct with divine will and love, becomes apparent,\nas that of which all nature is a type or an adumbration.”\n --Prof. Edward Dowden in his Comparative Study of Browning and Tennyson\n(Studies in Literature, 1789-1877).\n--\n\n     “But if, appealing thence, he cower, avouch\n     He is mere man, and in humility\n     Neither may know God nor mistake himself;\n     I point to the immediate consequence\n     And say, by such confession straight he falls     {575}\n     Into man’s place, a thing nor God nor beast,\n     Made to know that he can know and not more:\n     Lower than God who knows all and can all,\n     Higher than beasts which know and can so far\n     As each beast’s limit, perfect to an end,         {580}\n     Nor conscious that they know, nor craving more;\n     While man knows partly but conceives beside,\n     Creeps ever on from fancies to the fact,\n     And in this striving, this converting air\n     Into a solid he may grasp and use,                {585}\n     Finds progress, man’s distinctive mark alone,\n     Not God’s, and not the beasts’:  God is, they are,\n     Man partly is and wholly hopes to be.\n     Such progress could no more attend his soul\n     Were all it struggles after found at first        {590}\n     And guesses changed to knowledge absolute,\n     Than motion wait his body, were all else\n     Than it the solid earth on every side,\n     Where now through space he moves from rest to rest.\n     Man, therefore, thus conditioned, must expect     {595}\n     He could not, what he knows now, know at first;\n     What he considers that he knows to-day,\n     Come but to-morrow, he will find misknown;\n     Getting increase of knowledge, since he learns\n     Because he lives, which is to be a man,           {600}\n     Set to instruct himself by his past self:\n     First, like the brute, obliged by facts to learn,\n     Next, as man may, obliged by his own mind,\n     Bent, habit, nature, knowledge turned to law.\n     God’s gift was that man should conceive of truth, {605}\n     And yearn to gain it, catching at mistake,\n     As midway help till he reach fact indeed.\n     The statuary ere he mould a shape\n     Boasts a like gift, the shape’s idea, and next\n     The aspiration to produce the same;

That is, ‘With me as {with} Pamphylax, with him as {with} John’:\nSee Gospel of John, 17:11,21-23.\n--\n\n                   ------------\n\n“In the critical examination of the evangelical records,\nthe fourth Gospel suffered most.  Strauss--in this instance following\nhis early master and later antagonist, Baur--denied that St. John\nhad anything to do with its composition.  The author, he held,\nwas neither St. John nor any one else who had personally known Christ:\nnor, in accordance with a widely accepted theory, did he believe it\nto be the work of a pupil of St. John, who, after the death of\nhis master, related, from memory or from fragmentary notes,\ntraditions and sayings which had been taught him,\nand made out of them a continuous history.  Strauss pronounced it to be\na controversial work, written late in the second century after Christ,\nby a profound theologian of the Greek Gnostic and anti-Jewish school,\nwhose design was not to add another to the existing biographies\nof Christ, not to represent him as a real man, nor to give an account\nof any human life, but to produce an elaborate theological work\nin which, under the veil of allegory, the Neo-platonic conception\nof Christ as the Logos, the realized Word of God, the divine principle\nof light and life, should be developed.  With this purpose,\nthe writer made a free selection from the sayings and doings of Christ\nas recorded in the three Gospels already written, and as freely\ninvented others.  All the events, all the words, of the Gospel\nthus composed, are subordinate to the main design, which was worked out\nby the author with an artistic completeness most ingeniously traced by\nhis German interpreters.  Each miracle symbolizes some important dogma,\nand its narration must be understood to mean that it embodies\nsome deep spiritual truth, not, necessarily, that it ever actually\ntook place.  The author manifests, throughout, his ignorance of\nJewish customs, and his antagonism to Jewish sentiments.”\n\n     *    *    *    *    *\n\n“The general purport of the poem can scarcely be doubted,\nas we look back upon it as a whole and consider its main conclusions.\nThe tendency of the argument is to diminish the importance of\nthe original events--historical or traditional--on which\nthe Christian religion is based.  ‘It is not worth while,’\nthe writer seems to say to Strauss and his followers,\n‘to occupy ourselves with discussions about miracles and events\nwhich are said to have taken place a long time ago,\nand can now neither be denied or proved.  What we are concerned with,\nis, Christianity as it is now:  as a religion which the human mind\nhas through many generations developed, purified, spiritualized;\nand which has reacted upon human nature and made it wiser and nobler.\nShall we give up this faith which has been so great a power\nfor good in the world, and which, its whole past history justifies us\nin concluding, will continue its work of improvement, because our belief\nin certain events is shaken or destroyed?  It would be vain, indeed,\nthus to build our religion on a foundation so unstable\nas material evidence.  For human sensations are not infallible;\nthey very often deceive us; we think we see objects, which are really\nthe illusions of our own brain; others we see in part only,\nor distorted; others we fail to perceive at all.  Our faith,\nessential as it is to the well-being of the deepest parts of our nature,\nmust not be dependent on such controlling powers as these.’”\n\n     *    *    *    *    *\n\n“He {Browning} was, we may suppose, offended by Strauss’s\nruthless attack on much that mankind has held sacred for ages.\nHis religious sense was revolted by the assumption that\nthere was nothing in Christianity which could survive the destruction\nof the miraculous and supernatural elements in its history.\nHe desired to represent Christianity as an entirely spiritual religion,\nindependent of external, material agencies.  In order to make\nhis argument as powerful as possible, he chose for his mouth-piece\none of the personal followers of Christ, on whom, it might be supposed,\nthe actual human life of his master had made a permanent\nand lively impression.  With the details of Biblical criticism\nhe had nothing to do; his principles were unaffected by discussions\nabout the authenticity of the various parts of Gospels;\nso, in defiance of Strauss, the disciple he chose was that very John,\nwhose personality, as recognized by long tradition, had been\nso much discredited.  He showed how even in one of the disciples\nthe recollection of wonders and signs could be transcended,\nand at last obliterated, by a spiritual faith which was sustained\nby the needs and faculties of the soul.  The poem is, in effect,\nan eloquent protest in defence of ‘the breath and finer spirit\nof all knowledge’.”\n\nFrom Mrs. M. G.
