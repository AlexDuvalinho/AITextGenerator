He was of a fat habit, even from boyhood, and inclined\nto a cheerful and cursory reading of the face of life; and possibly this\nattitude of mind was the original cause of his misfortunes.  Beyond this\nhint philosophy is silent on his career, and superstition steps in with\nthe more ready explanation that he was detested of the gods.\n\nHis father—that iron gentleman—had long ago enthroned himself on the\nheights of the Disruption Principles.  What these are (and in spite of\ntheir grim name they are quite innocent) no array of terms would render\nthinkable to the merely English intelligence; but to the Scot they often\nprove unctuously nourishing, and Mr. Nicholson found in them the milk of\nlions.  About the period when the churches convene at Edinburgh in their\nannual assemblies, he was to be seen descending the Mound in the company\nof divers red-headed clergymen: these voluble, he only contributing\noracular nods, brief negatives, and the austere spectacle of his\nstretched upper lip.  The names of Candlish and Begg were frequent in\nthese interviews, and occasionally the talk ran on the Residuary\nEstablishment and the doings of one Lee.  A stranger to the tight little\ntheological kingdom of Scotland might have listened and gathered\nliterally nothing.  And Mr. Nicholson (who was not a dull man) knew this,\nand raged at it.  He knew there was a vast world outside, to whom\nDisruption Principles were as the chatter of tree-top apes; the paper\nbrought him chill whiffs from it; he had met Englishmen who had asked\nlightly if he did not belong to the Church of Scotland, and then had\nfailed to be much interested by his elucidation of that nice point; it\nwas an evil, wild, rebellious world, lying sunk in _dozenedness_, for\nnothing short of a Scots word will paint this Scotsman’s feelings.  And\nwhen he entered into his own house in Randolph Crescent (south side), and\nshut the door behind him, his heart swelled with security.  Here, at\nleast, was a citadel impregnable by right-hand defections or left-hand\nextremes.  Here was a family where prayers came at the same hour, where\nthe Sabbath literature was unimpeachably selected, where the guest who\nshould have leaned to any false opinion was instantly set down, and over\nwhich there reigned all week, and grew denser on Sundays, a silence that\nwas agreeable to his ear, and a gloom that he found comfortable.\n\nMrs. Nicholson had died about thirty, and left him with three children: a\ndaughter two years, and a son about eight years younger than John; and\nJohn himself, the unlucky bearer of a name infamous in English history.\nThe daughter, Maria, was a good girl—dutiful, pious, dull, but so easily\nstartled that to speak to her was quite a perilous enterprise.  ‘I don’t\nthink I care to talk about that, if you please,’ she would say, and\nstrike the boldest speechless by her unmistakable pain; this upon all\ntopics—dress, pleasure, morality, politics, in which the formula was\nchanged to ‘my papa thinks otherwise,’ and even religion, unless it was\napproached with a particular whining tone of voice.  Alexander, the\nyounger brother, was sickly, clever, fond of books and drawing, and full\nof satirical remarks.  In the midst of these, imagine that natural,\nclumsy, unintelligent, and mirthful animal, John; mighty well-behaved in\ncomparison with other lads, although not up to the mark of the house in\nRandolph Crescent; full of a sort of blundering affection, full of\ncaresses, which were never very warmly received; full of sudden and loud\nlaughter which rang out in that still house like curses.  Mr. Nicholson\nhimself had a great fund of humour, of the Scots order—intellectual,\nturning on the observation of men; his own character, for instance—if he\ncould have seen it in another—would have been a rare feast to him; but\nhis son’s empty guffaws over a broken plate, and empty, almost\nlight-hearted remarks, struck him with pain as the indices of a weak\nmind.\n\nOutside the family John had early attached himself (much as a dog may\nfollow a marquis) to the steps of Alan Houston, a lad about a year older\nthan himself, idle, a trifle wild, the heir to a good estate which was\nstill in the hands of a rigorous trustee, and so royally content with\nhimself that he took John’s devotion as a thing of course.  The intimacy\nwas gall to Mr. Nicholson; it took his son from the house, and he was a\njealous parent; it kept him from the office, and he was a martinet;\nlastly, Mr. Nicholson was ambitious for his family (in which, and the\nDisruption Principles, he entirely lived), and he hated to see a son of\nhis play second fiddle to an idler.  After some hesitation, he ordered\nthat the friendship should cease—an unfair command, though seemingly\ninspired by the spirit of prophecy; and John, saying nothing, continued\nto disobey the order under the rose.\n\nJohn was nearly nineteen when he was one day dismissed rather earlier\nthan usual from his father’s office, where he was studying the practice\nof the law.  It was Saturday; and except that he had a matter of four\nhundred pounds in his pocket which it was his duty to hand over to the\nBritish Linen Company’s Bank, he had the whole afternoon at his disposal.\nHe went by Princes Street enjoying the mild sunshine, and the little\nthrill of easterly wind that tossed the flags along that terrace of\npalaces, and tumbled the green trees in the garden.  The band was playing\ndown in the valley under the castle; and when it came to the turn of the\npipers, he heard their wild sounds with a stirring of the blood.\nSomething distantly martial woke in him; and he thought of Miss\nMackenzie, whom he was to meet that day at dinner.\n\nNow, it is undeniable that he should have gone directly to the bank, but\nright in the way stood the billiard-room of the hotel where Alan was\nalmost certain to be found; and the temptation proved too strong.  He\nentered the billiard-room, and was instantly greeted by his friend, cue\nin hand.\n\n‘Nicholson,’ said he, ‘I want you to lend me a pound or two till Monday.’\n\n‘You’ve come to the right shop, haven’t you?’ returned John.  ‘I have\ntwopence.’\n\n‘Nonsense,’ said Alan.  ‘You can get some.  Go and borrow at your\ntailor’s; they all do it.  Or I’ll tell you what: pop your watch.’\n\n‘Oh, yes, I dare say,’ said John.  ‘And how about my father?’\n\n‘How is he to know?  He doesn’t wind it up for you at night, does he?’\ninquired Alan, at which John guffawed.  ‘No, seriously; I am in a fix,’\ncontinued the tempter.  ‘I have lost some money to a man here.  I’ll give\nit you to-night, and you can get the heir-loom out again on Monday.\nCome; it’s a small service, after all.  I would do a good deal more for\nyou.’\n\nWhereupon John went forth, and pawned his gold watch under the assumed\nname of John Froggs, 85 Pleasance.  But the nervousness that assailed him\nat the door of that inglorious haunt—a pawnshop—and the effort necessary\nto invent the pseudonym (which, somehow, seemed to him a necessary part\nof the procedure), had taken more time than he imagined: and when he\nreturned to the billiard-room with the spoils, the bank had already\nclosed its doors.\n\nThis was a shrewd knock.  ‘A piece of business had been neglected.’  He\nheard these words in his father’s trenchant voice, and trembled, and then\ndodged the thought.  After all, who was to know?  He must carry four\nhundred pounds about with him till Monday, when the neglect could be\nsurreptitiously repaired; and meanwhile, he was free to pass the\nafternoon on the encircling divan of the billiard-room, smoking his pipe,\nsipping a pint of ale, and enjoying to the masthead the modest pleasures\nof admiration.\n\nNone can admire like a young man.  Of all youth’s passions and pleasures,\nthis is the most common and least alloyed; and every flash of Alan’s\nblack eyes; every aspect of his curly head; every graceful reach, every\neasy, stand-off attitude of waiting; ay, and down to his shirt-sleeves\nand wrist-links, were seen by John through a luxurious glory.  He valued\nhimself by the possession of that royal friend, hugged himself upon the\nthought, and swam in warm azure; his own defects, like vanquished\ndifficulties, becoming things on which to plume himself.  Only when he\nthought of Miss Mackenzie there fell upon his mind a shadow of regret;\nthat young lady was worthy of better things than plain John Nicholson,\nstill known among schoolmates by the derisive name of ‘Fatty’; and he\nfelt, if he could chalk a cue, or stand at ease, with such a careless\ngrace as Alan, he could approach the object of his sentiments with a less\ncrushing sense of inferiority.\n\nBefore they parted, Alan made a proposal that was startling in the\nextreme.  He would be at Colette’s that night about twelve, he said.  Why\nshould not John come there and get the money?  To go to Colette’s was to\nsee life, indeed; it was wrong; it was against the laws; it partook, in a\nvery dingy manner, of adventure.  Were it known, it was the sort of\nexploit that disconsidered a young man for good with the more serious\nclasses, but gave him a standing with the riotous.  And yet Colette’s was\nnot a hell; it could not come, without vaulting hyperbole, under the\nrubric of a gilded saloon; and, if it was a sin to go there, the sin was\nmerely local and municipal.  Colette (whose name I do not know how to\nspell, for I was never in epistolary communication with that hospitable\noutlaw) was simply an unlicensed publican, who gave suppers after eleven\nat night, the Edinburgh hour of closing.  If you belonged to a club, you\ncould get a much better supper at the same hour, and lose not a jot in\npublic esteem.  But if you lacked that qualification, and were an\nhungered, or inclined toward conviviality at unlawful hours, Colette’s\nwas your only port.  You were very ill-supplied.  The company was not\nrecruited from the Senate or the Church, though the Bar was very well\nrepresented on the only occasion on which I flew in the face of my\ncountry’s laws, and, taking my reputation in my hand, penetrated into\nthat grim supper-house.  And Colette’s frequenters, thrillingly conscious\nof wrong-doing and ‘that two-handed engine (the policeman) at the door,’\nwere perhaps inclined to somewhat feverish excess.  But the place was in\nno sense a very bad one; and it is somewhat strange to me, at this\ndistance of time, how it had acquired its dangerous repute.\n\nIn precisely the same spirit as a man may debate a project to ascend the\nMatterhorn or to cross Africa, John considered Alan’s proposal, and,\ngreatly daring, accepted it.  As he walked home, the thoughts of this\nexcursion out of the safe places of life into the wild and arduous,\nstirred and struggled in his imagination with the image of Miss\nMackenzie—incongruous and yet kindred thoughts, for did not each imply\nunusual tightening of the pegs of resolution? did not each woo him forth\nand warn him back again into himself?\n\nBetween these two considerations, at least, he was more than usually\nmoved; and when he got to Randolph Crescent, he quite forgot the four\nhundred pounds in the inner pocket of his greatcoat, hung up the coat,\nwith its rich freight, upon his particular pin of the hatstand; and in\nthe very action sealed his doom.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—IN WHICH JOHN REAPS THE WHIRLWIND\n\n\nABOUT half-past ten it was John’s brave good fortune to offer his arm to\nMiss Mackenzie, and escort her home.  The night was chill and starry; all\nthe way eastward the trees of the different gardens rustled and looked\nblack.  Up the stone gully of Leith Walk, when they came to cross it, the\nbreeze made a rush and set the flames of the street-lamps quavering; and\nwhen at last they had mounted to the Royal Terrace, where Captain\nMackenzie lived, a great salt freshness came in their faces from the sea.\nThese phases of the walk remained written on John’s memory, each\nemphasised by the touch of that light hand on his arm; and behind all\nthese aspects of the nocturnal city he saw, in his mind’s-eye, a picture\nof the lighted drawing-room at home where he had sat talking with Flora;\nand his father, from the other end, had looked on with a kind and\nironical smile.  John had read the significance of that smile, which\nmight have escaped a stranger.  Mr. Nicholson had remarked his son’s\nentanglement with satisfaction, tinged by humour; and his smile, if it\nstill was a thought contemptuous, had implied consent.\n\nAt the captain’s door the girl held out her hand, with a certain\nemphasis; and John took it and kept it a little longer, and said,\n‘Good-night, Flora, dear,’ and was instantly thrown into much fear by his\npresumption.  But she only laughed, ran up the steps, and rang the bell;\nand while she was waiting for the door to open, kept close in the porch,\nand talked to him from that point as out of a fortification.  She had a\nknitted shawl over her head; her blue Highland eyes took the light from\nthe neighbouring street-lamp and sparkled; and when the door opened and\nclosed upon her, John felt cruelly alone.\n\nHe proceeded slowly back along the terrace in a tender glow; and when he\ncame to Greenside Church, he halted in a doubtful mind.  Over the crown\nof the Calton Hill, to his left, lay the way to Colette’s, where Alan\nwould soon be looking for his arrival, and where he would now have no\nmore consented to go than he would have wilfully wallowed in a bog; the\ntouch of the girl’s hand on his sleeve, and the kindly light in his\nfather’s eyes, both loudly forbidding.  But right before him was the way\nhome, which pointed only to bed, a place of little ease for one whose\nfancy was strung to the lyrical pitch, and whose not very ardent heart\nwas just then tumultuously moved.  The hilltop, the cool air of the\nnight, the company of the great monuments, the sight of the city under\nhis feet, with its hills and valleys and crossing files of lamps, drew\nhim by all he had of the poetic, and he turned that way; and by that\nquite innocent deflection, ripened the crop of his venial errors for the\nsickle of destiny.\n\nOn a seat on the hill above Greenside he sat for perhaps half an hour,\nlooking down upon the lamps of Edinburgh, and up at the lamps of heaven.\nWonderful were the resolves he formed; beautiful and kindly were the\nvistas of future life that sped before him.  He uttered to himself the\nname of Flora in so many touching and dramatic keys, that he became at\nlength fairly melted with tenderness, and could have sung aloud.  At that\njuncture a certain creasing in his greatcoat caught his ear.  He put his\nhand into his pocket, pulled forth the envelope that held the money, and\nsat stupefied.  The Calton Hill, about this period, had an ill name of\nnights; and to be sitting there with four hundred pounds that did not\nbelong to him was hardly wise.  He looked up.  There was a man in a very\nbad hat a little on one side of him, apparently looking at the scenery;\nfrom a little on the other a second night-walker was drawing very quietly\nnear.  Up jumped John.  The envelope fell from his hands; he stooped to\nget it, and at the same moment both men ran in and closed with him.\n\nA little after, he got to his feet very sore and shaken, the poorer by a\npurse which contained exactly one penny postage-stamp, by a cambric\nhandkerchief, and by the all-important envelope.\n\nHere was a young man on whom, at the highest point of lovely exaltation,\nthere had fallen a blow too sharp to be supported alone; and not many\nhundred yards away his greatest friend was sitting at supper—ay, and even\nexpecting him.  Was it not in the nature of man that he should run there?\nHe went in quest of sympathy—in quest of that droll article that we all\nsuppose ourselves to want when in a strait, and have agreed to call\nadvice; and he went, besides, with vague but rather splendid expectations\nof relief.  Alan was rich, or would be so when he came of age.  By a\nstroke of the pen he might remedy this misfortune, and avert that dreaded\ninterview with Mr. Nicholson, from which John now shrunk in imagination\nas the hand draws back from fire.\n\nClose under the Calton Hill there runs a certain narrow avenue, part\nstreet, part by-road.  The head of it faces the doors of the prison; its\ntail descends into the sunless slums of the Low Calton.  On one hand it\nis overhung by the crags of the hill, on the other by an old graveyard.\nBetween these two the roadway runs in a trench, sparsely lighted at\nnight, sparsely frequented by day, and bordered, when it was cleared the\nplace of tombs, by dingy and ambiguous houses.  One of these was the\nhouse of Colette; and at his door our ill-starred John was presently\nbeating for admittance.  In an evil hour he satisfied the jealous\ninquiries of the contraband hotel-keeper; in an evil hour he penetrated\ninto the somewhat unsavoury interior.  Alan, to be sure, was there,\nseated in a room lighted by noisy gas-jets, beside a dirty table-cloth,\nengaged on a coarse meal, and in the company of several tipsy members of\nthe junior bar.  But Alan was not sober; he had lost a thousand pounds\nupon a horse-race, had received the news at dinner-time, and was now, in\ndefault of any possible means of extrication, drowning the memory of his\npredicament.  He to help John!  The thing was impossible; he couldn’t\nhelp himself.\n\n‘If you have a beast of a father,’ said he, ‘I can tell you I have a\nbrute of a trustee.’\n\n‘I’m not going to hear my father called a beast,’ said John with a\nbeating heart, feeling that he risked the last sound rivet of the chain\nthat bound him to life.\n\nBut Alan was quite good-natured.\n\n‘All right, old fellow,’ said he.  ‘Mos’ respec’able man your father.’\nAnd he introduced his friend to his companions as ‘old Nicholson the\nwhat-d’ye-call-um’s son.’\n\nJohn sat in dumb agony.  Colette’s foul walls and maculate table-linen,\nand even down to Colette’s villainous casters, seemed like objects in a\nnightmare.  And just then there came a knock and a scurrying; the police,\nso lamentably absent from the Calton Hill, appeared upon the scene; and\nthe party, taken _flagrante delicto_, with their glasses at their elbow,\nwere seized, marched up to the police office, and all duly summoned to\nappear as witnesses in the consequent case against that arch-shebeener,\nColette.\n\nIt was a sorrowful and a mightily sobered company that came forth again.\nThe vague terror of public opinion weighed generally on them all; but\nthere were private and particular horrors on the minds of individuals.\nAlan stood in dread of his trustee, already sorely tried.  One of the\ngroup was the son of a country minister, another of a judge; John, the\nunhappiest of all, had David Nicholson to father, the idea of facing whom\non such a scandalous subject was physically sickening.  They stood awhile\nconsulting under the buttresses of Saint Giles; thence they adjourned to\nthe lodgings of one of the number in North Castle Street, where (for that\nmatter) they might have had quite as good a supper, and far better drink,\nthan in the dangerous paradise from which they had been routed.  There,\nover an almost tearful glass, they debated their position.  Each\nexplained he had the world to lose if the affair went on, and he appeared\nas a witness.  It was remarkable what bright prospects were just then in\nthe very act of opening before each of that little company of youths, and\nwhat pious consideration for the feelings of their families began now to\nwell from them.  Each, moreover, was in an odd state of destitution.  Not\none could bear his share of the fine; not one but evinced a wonderful\ntwinkle of hope that each of the others (in succession) was the very man\nwho could step in to make good the deficit.  One took a high hand; he\ncould not pay his share; if it went to a trial, he should bolt; he had\nalways felt the English Bar to be his true sphere.  Another branched out\ninto touching details about his family, and was not listened to.  John,\nin the midst of this disorderly competition of poverty and meanness, sat\nstunned, contemplating the mountain bulk of his misfortunes.\n\nAt last, upon a pledge that each should apply to his family with a common\nfrankness, this convention of unhappy young asses broke up, went down the\ncommon stair, and in the grey of the spring morning, with the streets\nlying dead empty all about them, the lamps burning on into the daylight\nin diminished lustre, and the birds beginning to sound premonitory notes\nfrom the groves of the town gardens, went each his own way with bowed\nhead and echoing footfall.\n\nThe rooks were awake in Randolph Crescent; but the windows looked down,\ndiscreetly blinded, on the return of the prodigal.  John’s pass-key was a\nrecent privilege; this was the first time it had been used; and, oh! with\nwhat a sickening sense of his unworthiness he now inserted it into the\nwell-oiled lock and entered that citadel of the proprieties!  All slept;\nthe gas in the hall had been left faintly burning to light his return; a\ndreadful stillness reigned, broken by the deep ticking of the eight-day\nclock.  He put the gas out, and sat on a chair in the hall, waiting and\ncounting the minutes, longing for any human countenance.  But when at\nlast he heard the alarm spring its rattle in the lower story, and the\nservants begin to be about, he instantly lost heart, and fled to his own\nroom, where he threw himself upon the bed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—IN WHICH JOHN ENJOYS THE HARVEST HOME\n\n\nSHORTLY after breakfast, at which he assisted with a highly tragical\ncountenance, John sought his father where he sat, presumably in religious\nmeditation, on the Sabbath mornings.  The old gentleman looked up with\nthat sour, inquisitive expression that came so near to smiling and was so\ndifferent in effect.\n\n‘This is a time when I do not like to be disturbed,’ he said.\n\n‘I know that,’ returned John; ‘but I have—I want—I’ve made a dreadful\nmess of it,’ he broke out, and turned to the window.\n\nMr. Nicholson sat silent for an appreciable time, while his unhappy son\nsurveyed the poles in the back green, and a certain yellow cat that was\nperched upon the wall.  Despair sat upon John as he gazed; and he raged\nto think of the dreadful series of his misdeeds, and the essential\ninnocence that lay behind them.\n\n‘Well,’ said the father, with an obvious effort, but in very quiet tones,\n‘what is it?’\n\n‘Maclean gave me four hundred pounds to put in the bank, sir,’ began\nJohn; ‘and I’m sorry to say that I’ve been robbed of it!’\n\n‘Robbed of it?’ cried Mr. Nicholson, with a strong rising inflection.\n‘Robbed?  Be careful what you say, John!’\n\n‘I can’t say anything else, sir; I was just robbed of it,’ said John, in\ndesperation, sullenly.\n\n‘And where and when did this extraordinary event take place?’ inquired\nthe father.\n\n‘On the Calton Hill about twelve last night.’\n\n‘The Calton Hill?’ repeated Mr. Nicholson.  ‘And what were you doing\nthere at such a time of the night?’\n\n‘Nothing, sir,’ says John.\n\nMr. Nicholson drew in his breath.\n\n‘And how came the money in your hands at twelve last night?’ he asked,\nsharply.\n\n‘I neglected that piece of business,’ said John, anticipating comment;\nand then in his own dialect: ‘I clean forgot all about it.’\n\n‘Well,’ said his father, ‘it’s a most extraordinary story.  Have you\ncommunicated with the police?’\n\n‘I have,’ answered poor John, the blood leaping to his face.  ‘They think\nthey know the men that did it.  I dare say the money will be recovered,\nif that was all,’ said he, with a desperate indifference, which his\nfather set down to levity; but which sprung from the consciousness of\nworse behind.\n\n‘Your mother’s watch, too?’ asked Mr. Nicholson.\n\n‘Oh, the watch is all right!’ cried John.  ‘At least, I mean I was coming\nto the watch—the fact is, I am ashamed to say, I—I had pawned the watch\nbefore.  Here is the ticket; they didn’t find that; the watch can be\nredeemed; they don’t sell pledges.’  The lad panted out these phrases,\none after another, like minute guns; but at the last word, which rang in\nthat stately chamber like an oath, his heart failed him utterly; and the\ndreaded silence settled on father and son.\n\nIt was broken by Mr. Nicholson picking up the pawn-ticket: ‘John Froggs,\n85 Pleasance,’ he read; and then turning upon John, with a brief flash of\npassion and disgust, ‘Who is John Froggs?’ he cried.\n\n‘Nobody,’ said John.  ‘It was just a name.’\n\n‘An _alias_,’ his father commented.\n\n‘Oh!  I think scarcely quite that,’ said the culprit; ‘it’s a form, they\nall do it, the man seemed to understand, we had a great deal of fun over\nthe name—’\n\nHe paused at that, for he saw his father wince at the picture like a man\nphysically struck; and again there was silence.\n\n‘I do not think,’ said Mr. Nicholson, at last, ‘that I am an ungenerous\nfather.  I have never grudged you money within reason, for any avowable\npurpose; you had just to come to me and speak.  And now I find that you\nhave forgotten all decency and all natural feeling, and actually\npawned—pawned—your mother’s watch.  You must have had some temptation; I\nwill do you the justice to suppose it was a strong one.  What did you\nwant with this money?’\n\n‘I would rather not tell you, sir,’ said John.  ‘It will only make you\nangry.’\n\n‘I will not be fenced with,’ cried his father.  ‘There must be an end of\ndisingenuous answers.  What did you want with this money?’\n\n‘To lend it to Houston, sir,’ says John.\n\n‘I thought I had forbidden you to speak to that young man?’ asked the\nfather.\n\n‘Yes, sir,’ said John; ‘but I only met him.’\n\n‘Where?’ came the deadly question.\n\nAnd ‘In a billiard-room’ was the damning answer.  Thus, had John’s single\ndeparture from the truth brought instant punishment.  For no other\npurpose but to see Alan would he have entered a billiard-room; but he had\ndesired to palliate the fact of his disobedience, and now it appeared\nthat he frequented these disreputable haunts upon his own account.\n\nOnce more Mr. Nicholson digested the vile tidings in silence, and when\nJohn stole a glance at his father’s countenance, he was abashed to see\nthe marks of suffering.\n\n‘Well,’ said the old gentleman, at last, ‘I cannot pretend not to be\nsimply bowed down.  I rose this morning what the world calls a happy\nman—happy, at least, in a son of whom I thought I could be reasonably\nproud—’\n\nBut it was beyond human nature to endure this longer, and John\ninterrupted almost with a scream.  ‘Oh, wheest!’ he cried, ‘that’s not\nall, that’s not the worst of it—it’s nothing!  How could I tell you were\nproud of me?  Oh!  I wish, I wish that I had known; but you always said I\nwas such a disgrace!  And the dreadful thing is this: we were all taken\nup last night, and we have to pay Colette’s fine among the six, or we’ll\nbe had up for evidence—shebeening it is.  They made me swear to tell you;\nbut for my part,’ he cried, bursting into tears, ‘I just wish that I was\ndead!’  And he fell on his knees before a chair and hid his face.\n\nWhether his father spoke, or whether he remained long in the room or at\nonce departed, are points lost to history.  A horrid turmoil of mind and\nbody; bursting sobs; broken, vanishing thoughts, now of indignation, now\nof remorse; broken elementary whiffs of consciousness, of the smell of\nthe horse-hair on the chair bottom, of the jangling of church bells that\nnow began to make day horrible throughout the confines of the city, of\nthe hard floor that bruised his knees, of the taste of tears that found\ntheir way into his mouth: for a period of time, the duration of which I\ncannot guess, while I refuse to dwell longer on its agony, these were the\nwhole of God’s world for John Nicholson.\n\nWhen at last, as by the touching of a spring, he returned again to\nclearness of consciousness and even a measure of composure, the bells had\nbut just done ringing, and the Sabbath silence was still marred by the\npatter of belated feet.  By the clock above the fire, as well as by these\nmore speaking signs, the service had not long begun; and the unhappy\nsinner, if his father had really gone to church, might count on near two\nhours of only comparative unhappiness.  With his father, the superlative\ndegree returned infallibly.  He knew it by every shrinking fibre in his\nbody, he knew it by the sudden dizzy whirling of his brain, at the mere\nthought of that calamity.  An hour and a half, perhaps an hour and\nthree-quarters, if the doctor was long-winded, and then would begin again\nthat active agony from which, even in the dull ache of the present, he\nshrunk as from the bite of fire.  He saw, in a vision, the family pew,\nthe somnolent cushions, the Bibles, the psalm-books, Maria with her\nsmelling-salts, his father sitting spectacled and critical; and at once\nhe was struck with indignation, not unjustly.  It was inhuman to go off\nto church, and leave a sinner in suspense, unpunished, unforgiven.  And\nat the very touch of criticism, the paternal sanctity was lessened; yet\nthe paternal terror only grew; and the two strands of feeling pushed him\nin the same direction.\n\nAnd suddenly there came upon him a mad fear lest his father should have\nlocked him in.  The notion had no ground in sense; it was probably no\nmore than a reminiscence of similar calamities in childhood, for his\nfather’s room had always been the chamber of inquisition and the scene of\npunishment; but it stuck so rigorously in his mind that he must instantly\napproach the door and prove its untruth.  As he went, he struck upon a\ndrawer left open in the business table.  It was the money-drawer, a\nmeasure of his father’s disarray: the money-drawer—perhaps a pointing\nprovidence!  Who is to decide, when even divines differ between a\nprovidence and a temptation? or who, sitting calmly under his own vine,\nis to pass a judgment on the doings of a poor, hunted dog, slavishly\nafraid, slavishly rebellious, like John Nicholson on that particular\nSunday?  His hand was in the drawer, almost before his mind had conceived\nthe hope; and rising to his new situation, he wrote, sitting in his\nfather’s chair and using his father’s blotting-pad, his pitiful apology\nand farewell:—\n\n    ‘MY DEAR FATHER,—I have taken the money, but I will pay it back as\n    soon as I am able.  You will never hear of me again.  I did not mean\n    any harm by anything, so I hope you will try and forgive me.  I wish\n    you would say good-bye to Alexander and Maria, but not if you don’t\n    want to.  I could not wait to see you, really.  Please try to forgive\n    me.  Your affectionate son,\n\n                                                          JOHN NICHOLSON.’\n\nThe coins abstracted and the missive written, he could not be gone too\nsoon from the scene of these transgressions; and remembering how his\nfather had once returned from church, on some slight illness, in the\nmiddle of the second psalm, he durst not even make a packet of a change\nof clothes.  Attired as he was, he slipped from the paternal doors, and\nfound himself in the cool spring air, the thin spring sunshine, and the\ngreat Sabbath quiet of the city, which was now only pointed by the cawing\nof the rooks.  There was not a soul in Randolph Crescent, nor a soul in\nQueensferry Street; in this outdoor privacy and the sense of escape, John\ntook heart again; and with a pathetic sense of leave-taking, he even\nventured up the lane and stood awhile, a strange peri at the gates of a\nquaint paradise, by the west end of St. George’s Church.  They were\nsinging within; and by a strange chance, the tune was ‘St. George’s,\nEdinburgh,’ which bears the name, and was first sung in the choir of that\nchurch.  ‘Who is this King of Glory?’ went the voices from within; and,\nto John, this was like the end of all Christian observances, for he was\nnow to be a wild man like Ishmael, and his life was to be cast in\nhomeless places and with godless people.\n\nIt was thus, with no rising sense of the adventurous, but in mere\ndesolation and despair, that he turned his back on his native city, and\nset out on foot for California, with a more immediate eye to Glasgow.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—THE SECOND SOWING\n\n\nIT is no part of mine to narrate the adventures of John Nicholson, which\nwere many, but simply his more momentous misadventures, which were more\nthan he desired, and, by human standards, more than he deserved; how he\nreached California, how he was rooked, and robbed, and beaten, and\nstarved; how he was at last taken up by charitable folk, restored to some\ndegree of self-complacency, and installed as a clerk in a bank in San\nFrancisco, it would take too long to tell; nor in these episodes were\nthere any marks of the peculiar Nicholsonic destiny, for they were just\nsuch matters as befell some thousands of other young adventurers in the\nsame days and places.  But once posted in the bank, he fell for a time\ninto a high degree of good fortune, which, as it was only a longer way\nabout to fresh disaster, it behooves me to explain.\n\nIt was his luck to meet a young man in what is technically called a\n‘dive,’ and thanks to his monthly wages, to extricate this new\nacquaintance from a position of present disgrace and possible danger in\nthe future.  This young man was the nephew of one of the Nob Hill\nmagnates, who run the San Francisco Stock Exchange, much as more humble\nadventurers, in the corner of some public park at home, may be seen to\nperform the simple artifice of pea and thimble: for their own profit,\nthat is to say, and the discouragement of public gambling.  It was thus\nin his power—and, as he was of grateful temper, it was among the things\nthat he desired—to put John in the way of growing rich; and thus, without\nthought or industry, or so much as even understanding the game at which\nhe played, but by simply buying and selling what he was told to buy and\nsell, that plaything of fortune was presently at the head of between\neleven and twelve thousand pounds, or, as he reckoned it, of upward of\nsixty thousand dollars.\n\nHow he had come to deserve this wealth, any more than how he had formerly\nearned disgrace at home, was a problem beyond the reach of his\nphilosophy.  It was true that he had been industrious at the bank, but no\nmore so than the cashier, who had seven small children and was visibly\nsinking in decline.  Nor was the step which had determined his advance—a\nvisit to a dive with a month’s wages in his pocket—an act of such\ntranscendent virtue, or even wisdom, as to seem to merit the favour of\nthe gods.  From some sense of this, and of the dizzy see-saw—heaven-high,\nhell-deep—on which men sit clutching; or perhaps fearing that the sources\nof his fortune might be insidiously traced to some root in the field of\npetty cash; he stuck to his work, said not a word of his new\ncircumstances, and kept his account with a bank in a different quarter of\nthe town.  The concealment, innocent as it seems, was the first step in\nthe second tragicomedy of John’s existence.\n\nMeanwhile, he had never written home.  Whether from diffidence or shame,\nor a touch of anger, or mere procrastination, or because (as we have\nseen) he had no skill in literary arts, or because (as I am sometimes\ntempted to suppose) there is a law in human nature that prevents young\nmen—not otherwise beasts—from the performance of this simple act of\npiety—months and years had gone by, and John had never written.  The\nhabit of not writing, indeed, was already fixed before he had begun to\ncome into his fortune; and it was only the difficulty of breaking this\nlong silence that withheld him from an instant restitution of the money\nhe had stolen or (as he preferred to call it) borrowed.  In vain he sat\nbefore paper, attending on inspiration; that heavenly nymph, beyond\nsuggesting the words ‘my dear father,’ remained obstinately silent; and\npresently John would crumple up the sheet and decide, as soon as he had\n‘a good chance,’ to carry the money home in person.  And this delay,\nwhich is indefensible, was his second step into the snares of fortune.\n\nTen years had passed, and John was drawing near to thirty.  He had kept\nthe promise of his boyhood, and was now of a lusty frame, verging toward\ncorpulence; good features, good eyes, a genial manner, a ready laugh, a\nlong pair of sandy whiskers, a dash of an American accent, a close\nfamiliarity with the great American joke, and a certain likeness to a\nR-y-l P-rs-n-ge, who shall remain nameless for me, made up the man’s\nexternals as he could be viewed in society.  Inwardly, in spite of his\ngross body and highly masculine whiskers, he was more like a maiden lady\nthan a man of twenty-nine.\n\nIt chanced one day, as he was strolling down Market Street on the eve of\nhis fortnight’s holiday, that his eye was caught by certain railway\nbills, and in very idleness of mind he calculated that he might be home\nfor Christmas if he started on the morrow.  The fancy thrilled him with\ndesire, and in one moment he decided he would go.\n\nThere was much to be done: his portmanteau to be packed, a credit to be\ngot from the bank where he was a wealthy customer, and certain offices to\nbe transacted for that other bank in which he was an humble clerk; and it\nchanced, in conformity with human nature, that out of all this business\nit was the last that came to be neglected.  Night found him, not only\nequipped with money of his own, but once more (as on that former\noccasion) saddled with a considerable sum of other people’s.\n\nNow it chanced there lived in the same boarding-house a fellow-clerk of\nhis, an honest fellow, with what is called a weakness for drink—though it\nmight, in this case, have been called a strength, for the victim had been\ndrunk for weeks together without the briefest intermission.  To this\nunfortunate John intrusted a letter with an inclosure of bonds, addressed\nto the bank manager.  Even as he did so he thought he perceived a certain\nhaziness of eye and speech in his trustee; but he was too hopeful to be\nstayed, silenced the voice of warning in his bosom, and with one and the\nsame gesture committed the money to the clerk, and himself into the hands\nof destiny.\n\nI dwell, even at the risk of tedium, on John’s minutest errors, his case\nbeing so perplexing to the moralist; but we have done with them now, the\nroll is closed, the reader has the worst of our poor hero, and I leave\nhim to judge for himself whether he or John has been the less deserving.\nHenceforth we have to follow the spectacle of a man who was a mere\nwhip-top for calamity; on whose unmerited misadventures not even the\nhumourist can look without pity, and not even the philosopher without\nalarm.\n\nThat same night the clerk entered upon a bout of drunkenness so\nconsistent as to surprise even his intimate acquaintance.  He was\nspeedily ejected from the boarding-house; deposited his portmanteau with\na perfect stranger, who did not even catch his name; wandered he knew not\nwhere, and was at last hove-to, all standing, in a hospital at\nSacramento.  There, under the impenetrable _alias_ of the number of his\nbed, the crapulous being lay for some more days unconscious of all\nthings, and of one thing in particular: that the police were after him.\nTwo months had come and gone before the convalescent in the Sacramento\nhospital was identified with Kirkman, the absconding San Francisco clerk;\neven then, there must elapse nearly a fortnight more till the perfect\nstranger could be hunted up, the portmanteau recovered, and John’s letter\ncarried at length to its destination, the seal still unbroken, the\ninclosure still intact.\n\nMeanwhile, John had gone upon his holidays without a word, which was\nirregular; and there had disappeared with him a certain sum of money,\nwhich was out of all bounds of palliation.  But he was known to be\ncareless, and believed to be honest; the manager besides had a regard for\nhim; and little was said, although something was no doubt thought, until\nthe fortnight was finally at an end, and the time had come for John to\nreappear.  Then, indeed, the affair began to look black; and when\ninquiries were made, and the penniless clerk was found to have amassed\nthousands of dollars, and kept them secretly in a rival establishment,\nthe stoutest of his friends abandoned him, the books were overhauled for\ntraces of ancient and artful fraud, and though none were found, there\nstill prevailed a general impression of loss.  The telegraph was set in\nmotion; and the correspondent of the bank in Edinburgh, for which place\nit was understood that John had armed himself with extensive credits, was\nwarned to communicate with the police.\n\nNow this correspondent was a friend of Mr. Nicholson’s; he was well\nacquainted with the tale of John’s calamitous disappearance from\nEdinburgh; and putting one thing with another, hasted with the first word\nof this scandal, not to the police, but to his friend.  The old gentleman\nhad long regarded his son as one dead; John’s place had been taken, the\nmemory of his faults had already fallen to be one of those old aches,\nwhich awaken again indeed upon occasion, but which we can always vanquish\nby an effort of the will; and to have the long lost resuscitated in a\nfresh disgrace was doubly bitter.\n\n‘Macewen,’ said the old man, ‘this must be hushed up, if possible.  If I\ngive you a cheek for this sum, about which they are certain, could you\ntake it on yourself to let the matter rest?’\n\n‘I will,’ said Macewen.  ‘I will take the risk of it.’\n\n‘You understand,’ resumed Mr. Nicholson, speaking precisely, but with\nashen lips, ‘I do this for my family, not for that unhappy young man.  If\nit should turn out that these suspicions are correct, and he has\nembezzled large sums, he must lie on his bed as he has made it.’  And\nthen looking up at Macewen with a nod, and one of his strange smiles:\n‘Good-bye,’ said he, and Macewen, perceiving the case to be too grave for\nconsolation, took himself off, and blessed God on his way home that he\nwas childless.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—THE PRODIGAL’S RETURN\n\n\nBY a little after noon on the eve of Christmas, John had left his\nportmanteau in the cloak-room, and stepped forth into Princes Street with\na wonderful expansion of the soul, such as men enjoy on the completion of\nlong-nourished schemes.  He was at home again, incognito and rich;\npresently he could enter his father’s house by means of the pass-key,\nwhich he had piously preserved through all his wanderings; he would throw\ndown the borrowed money; there would be a reconciliation, the details of\nwhich he frequently arranged; and he saw himself, during the next month,\nmade welcome in many stately houses at many frigid dinner-parties, taking\nhis share in the conversation with the freedom of the man and the\ntraveller, and laying down the law upon finance with the authority of the\nsuccessful investor.  But this programme was not to be begun before\nevening—not till just before dinner, indeed, at which meal the\nreassembled family were to sit roseate, and the best wine, the modern\nfatted calf, should flow for the prodigal’s return.\n\nMeanwhile he walked familiar streets, merry reminiscences crowding round\nhim, sad ones also, both with the same surprising pathos.  The keen\nfrosty air; the low, rosy, wintry sun; the castle, hailing him like an\nold acquaintance; the names of friends on door-plates; the sight of\nfriends whom he seemed to recognise, and whom he eagerly avoided, in the\nstreets; the pleasant chant of the north-country accent; the dome of St.\nGeorge’s reminding him of his last penitential moments in the lane, and\nof that King of Glory whose name had echoed ever since in the saddest\ncorner of his memory; and the gutters where he had learned to slide, and\nthe shop where he had bought his skates, and the stones on which he had\ntrod, and the railings in which he had rattled his clachan as he went to\nschool; and all those thousand and one nameless particulars, which the\neye sees without noting, which the memory keeps indeed yet without\nknowing, and which, taken one with another, build up for us the aspect of\nthe place that we call home: all these besieged him, as he went, with\nboth delight and sadness.\n\nHis first visit was for Houston, who had a house on Regent Terrace, kept\nfor him in old days by an aunt.  The door was opened (to his surprise)\nupon the chain, and a voice asked him from within what he wanted.\n\n‘I want Mr. Houston—Mr. Alan Houston,’ said he.\n\n‘And who are ye?’ said the voice.\n\n‘This is most extraordinary,’ thought John; and then aloud he told his\nname.\n\n‘No’ young Mr. John?’ cried the voice, with a sudden increase of Scotch\naccent, testifying to a friendlier feeling.\n\n‘The very same,’ said John.\n\nAnd the old butler removed his defences, remarking only ‘I thocht ye were\nthat man.’  But his master was not there; he was staying, it appeared, at\nthe house in Murrayfield; and though the butler would have been glad\nenough to have taken his place and given all the news of the family,\nJohn, struck with a little chill, was eager to be gone.  Only, the door\nwas scarce closed again, before he regretted that he had not asked about\n‘that man.’\n\nHe was to pay no more visits till he had seen his father and made all\nwell at home; Alan had been the only possible exception, and John had not\ntime to go as far as Murrayfield.  But here he was on Regent Terrace;\nthere was nothing to prevent him going round the end of the hill, and\nlooking from without on the Mackenzies’ house.  As he went, he reflected\nthat Flora must now be a woman of near his own age, and it was within the\nbounds of possibility that she was married; but this dishonourable doubt\nhe dammed down.\n\nThere was the house, sure enough; but the door was of another colour, and\nwhat was this—two door-plates?  He drew nearer; the top one bore, with\ndignified simplicity, the words, ‘Mr. Proudfoot’; the lower one was more\nexplicit, and informed the passer-by that here was likewise the abode of\n‘Mr. J. A. Dunlop Proudfoot, Advocate.’  The Proudfoots must be rich, for\nno advocate could look to have much business in so remote a quarter; and\nJohn hated them for their wealth and for their name, and for the sake of\nthe house they desecrated with their presence.  He remembered a Proudfoot\nhe had seen at school, not known: a little, whey-faced urchin, the\ndespicable member of some lower class.  Could it be this abortion that\nhad climbed to be an advocate, and now lived in the birthplace of Flora\nand the home of John’s tenderest memories?  The chill that had first\nseized upon him when he heard of Houston’s absence deepened and struck\ninward.  For a moment, as he stood under the doors of that estranged\nhouse, and looked east and west along the solitary pavement of the Royal\nTerrace, where not a cat was stirring, the sense of solitude and\ndesolation took him by the throat, and he wished himself in San\nFrancisco.\n\nAnd then the figure he made, with his decent portliness, his whiskers,\nthe money in his purse, the excellent cigar that he now lighted, recurred\nto his mind in consolatory comparison with that of a certain maddened lad\nwho, on a certain spring Sunday ten years before, and in the hour of\nchurch-time silence, had stolen from that city by the Glasgow road.  In\nthe face of these changes, it were impious to doubt fortune’s kindness.\nAll would be well yet; the Mackenzies would be found, Flora, younger and\nlovelier and kinder than before; Alan would be found, and would have so\nnicely discriminated his behaviour as to have grown, on the one hand,\ninto a valued friend of Mr. Nicholson’s, and to have remained, upon the\nother, of that exact shade of joviality which John desired in his\ncompanions.  And so, once more, John fell to work discounting the\ndelightful future: his first appearance in the family pew; his first\nvisit to his uncle Greig, who thought himself so great a financier, and\non whose purblind Edinburgh eyes John was to let in the dazzling daylight\nof the West; and the details in general of that unrivalled transformation\nscene, in which he was to display to all Edinburgh a portly and\nsuccessful gentleman in the shoes of the derided fugitive.\n\nThe time began to draw near when his father would have returned from the\noffice, and it would be the prodigal’s cue to enter.  He strolled\nwestward by Albany Street, facing the sunset embers, pleased, he knew not\nwhy, to move in that cold air and indigo twilight, starred with\nstreet-lamps.  But there was one more disenchantment waiting him by the\nway.\n\nAt the corner of Pitt Street he paused to light a fresh cigar; the vesta\nthrew, as he did so, a strong light upon his features, and a man of about\nhis own age stopped at sight of it.\n\n‘I think your name must be Nicholson,’ said the stranger.\n\nIt was too late to avoid recognition; and besides, as John was now\nactually on the way home, it hardly mattered, and he gave way to the\nimpulse of his nature.\n\n‘Great Scott!’ he cried, ‘Beatson!’ and shook hands with warmth.  It\nscarce seemed he was repaid in kind.\n\n‘So you’re home again?’ said Beatson.  ‘Where have you been all this long\ntime?’\n\n‘In the States,’ said John—‘California.  I’ve made my pile though; and it\nsuddenly struck me it would be a noble scheme to come home for\nChristmas.’\n\n‘I see,’ said Beatson.  ‘Well, I hope we’ll see something of you now\nyou’re here.’\n\n‘Oh, I guess so,’ said John, a little frozen.\n\n‘Well, ta-ta,’ concluded Beatson, and he shook hands again and went.\n\nThis was a cruel first experience.  It was idle to blink facts: here was\nJohn home again, and Beatson—Old Beatson—did not care a rush.  He\nrecalled Old Beatson in the past—that merry and affectionate lad—and\ntheir joint adventures and mishaps, the window they had broken with a\ncatapult in India Place, the escalade of the castle rock, and many\nanother inestimable bond of friendship; and his hurt surprise grew\ndeeper.  Well, after all, it was only on a man’s own family that he could\ncount; blood was thicker than water, he remembered; and the net result of\nthis encounter was to bring him to the doorstep of his father’s house,\nwith tenderer and softer feelings.\n\nThe night had come; the fanlight over the door shone bright; the two\nwindows of the dining-room where the cloth was being laid, and the three\nwindows of the drawing-room where Maria would be waiting dinner, glowed\nsoftlier through yellow blinds.  It was like a vision of the past.  All\nthis time of his absence life had gone forward with an equal foot, and\nthe fires and the gas had been lighted, and the meals spread, at the\naccustomed hours.  At the accustomed hour, too, the bell had sounded\nthrice to call the family to worship.  And at the thought, a pang of\nregret for his demerit seized him; he remembered the things that were\ngood and that he had neglected, and the things that were evil and that he\nhad loved; and it was with a prayer upon his lips that he mounted the\nsteps and thrust the key into the key-hole.\n\nHe stepped into the lighted hall, shut the door softly behind him, and\nstood there fixed in wonder.  No surprise of strangeness could equal the\nsurprise of that complete familiarity.  There was the bust of Chalmers\nnear the stair-railings, there was the clothes-brush in the accustomed\nplace; and there, on the hat-stand, hung hats and coats that must surely\nbe the same as he remembered.  Ten years dropped from his life, as a pin\nmay slip between the fingers; and the ocean and the mountains, and the\nmines, and crowded marts and mingled races of San Francisco, and his own\nfortune and his own disgrace, became, for that one moment, the figures of\na dream that was over.\n\nHe took off his hat, and moved mechanically toward the stand; and there\nhe found a small change that was a great one to him.  The pin that had\nbeen his from boyhood, where he had flung his balmoral when he loitered\nhome from the Academy, and his first hat when he came briskly back from\ncollege or the office—his pin was occupied.  ‘They might have at least\nrespected my pin!’ he thought, and he was moved as by a slight, and began\nat once to recollect that he was here an interloper, in a strange house,\nwhich he had entered almost by a burglary, and where at any moment he\nmight be scandalously challenged.\n\nHe moved at once, his hat still in his hand, to the door of his father’s\nroom, opened it, and entered.  Mr. Nicholson sat in the same place and\nposture as on that last Sunday morning; only he was older, and greyer,\nand sterner; and as he now glanced up and caught the eye of his son, a\nstrange commotion and a dark flush sprung into his face.\n\n‘Father,’ said John, steadily, and even cheerfully, for this was a moment\nagainst which he was long ago prepared, ‘father, here I am, and here is\nthe money that I took from you.  I have come back to ask your\nforgiveness, and to stay Christmas with you and the children.’\n\n‘Keep your money,’ said the father, ‘and go!’\n\n‘Father!’ cried John; ‘for God’s sake don’t receive me this way.  I’ve\ncome for—’\n\n‘Understand me,’ interrupted Mr. Nicholson; ‘you are no son of mine; and\nin the sight of God, I wash my hands of you.  One last thing I will tell\nyou; one warning I will give you; all is discovered, and you are being\nhunted for your crimes; if you are still at large it is thanks to me; but\nI have done all that I mean to do; and from this time forth I would not\nraise one finger—not one finger—to save you from the gallows!  And now,’\nwith a low voice of absolute authority, and a single weighty gesture of\nthe finger, ‘and now—go!’\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—THE HOUSE AT MURRAYFIELD\n\n\nHOW John passed the evening, in what windy confusion of mind, in what\nsqualls of anger and lulls of sick collapse, in what pacing of streets\nand plunging into public-houses, it would profit little to relate.  His\nmisery, if it were not progressive, yet tended in no way to diminish; for\nin proportion as grief and indignation abated, fear began to take their\nplace.  At first, his father’s menacing words lay by in some safe drawer\nof memory, biding their hour.  At first, John was all thwarted affection\nand blighted hope; next bludgeoned vanity raised its head again, with\ntwenty mortal gashes: and the father was disowned even as he had disowned\nthe son.  What was this regular course of life, that John should have\nadmired it? what were these clock-work virtues, from which love was\nabsent?  Kindness was the test, kindness the aim and soul; and judged by\nsuch a standard, the discarded prodigal—now rapidly drowning his sorrows\nand his reason in successive drams—was a creature of a lovelier morality\nthan his self-righteous father.  Yes, he was the better man; he felt it,\nglowed with the consciousness, and entering a public-house at the corner\nof Howard Place (whither he had somehow wandered) he pledged his own\nvirtues in a glass—perhaps the fourth since his dismissal.  Of that he\nknew nothing, keeping no account of what he did or where he went; and in\nthe general crashing hurry of his nerves, unconscious of the approach of\nintoxication.  Indeed, it is a question whether he were really growing\nintoxicated, or whether at first the spirits did not even sober him.  For\nit was even as he drained this last glass that his father’s ambiguous and\nmenacing words—popping from their hiding-place in memory—startled him\nlike a hand laid upon his shoulder.  ‘Crimes, hunted, the gallows.’  They\nwere ugly words; in the ears of an innocent man, perhaps all the uglier;\nfor if some judicial error were in act against him, who should set a\nlimit to its grossness or to how far it might be pushed?  Not John,\nindeed; he was no believer in the powers of innocence, his cursed\nexperience pointing in quite other ways; and his fears, once wakened,\ngrew with every hour and hunted him about the city streets.\n\nIt was, perhaps, nearly nine at night; he had eaten nothing since lunch,\nhe had drunk a good deal, and he was exhausted by emotion, when the\nthought of Houston came into his head.  He turned, not merely to the man\nas a friend, but to his house as a place of refuge.  The danger that\nthreatened him was still so vague that he knew neither what to fear nor\nwhere he might expect it; but this much at least seemed undeniable, that\na private house was safer than a public inn.  Moved by these counsels, he\nturned at once to the Caledonian Station, passed (not without alarm) into\nthe bright lights of the approach, redeemed his portmanteau from the\ncloak-room, and was soon whirling in a cab along the Glasgow Road.  The\nchange of movement and position, the sight of the lamps twinkling to the\nrear, and the smell of damp and mould and rotten straw which clung about\nthe vehicle, wrought in him strange alternations of lucidity and mortal\ngiddiness.\n\n‘I have been drinking,’ he discovered; ‘I must go straight to bed, and\nsleep.’  And he thanked Heaven for the drowsiness that came upon his mind\nin waves.\n\nFrom one of these spells he was wakened by the stoppage of the cab; and,\ngetting down, found himself in quite a country road, the last lamp of the\nsuburb shining some way below, and the high walls of a garden rising\nbefore him in the dark.  The Lodge (as the place was named), stood,\nindeed, very solitary.  To the south it adjoined another house, but\nstanding in so large a garden as to be well out of cry; on all other\nsides, open fields stretched upward to the woods of Corstorphine Hill, or\nbackward to the dells of Ravelston, or downward toward the valley of the\nLeith.  The effect of seclusion was aided by the great height of the\ngarden walls, which were, indeed, conventual, and, as John had tested in\nformer days, defied the climbing schoolboy.  The lamp of the cab threw a\ngleam upon the door and the not brilliant handle of the bell.\n\n‘Shall I ring for ye?’ said the cabman, who had descended from his perch,\nand was slapping his chest, for the night was bitter.\n\n‘I wish you would,’ said John, putting his hand to his brow in one of his\naccesses of giddiness.\n\nThe man pulled at the handle, and the clanking of the bell replied from\nfurther in the garden; twice and thrice he did it, with sufficient\nintervals; in the great frosty silence of the night the sounds fell sharp\nand small.\n\n‘Does he expect ye?’ asked the driver, with that manner of familiar\ninterest that well became his port-wine face; and when John had told him\nno, ‘Well, then,’ said the cabman, ‘if ye’ll tak’ my advice of it, we’ll\njust gang back.  And that’s disinterested, mind ye, for my stables are in\nthe Glesgie Road.’\n\n‘The servants must hear,’ said John.\n\n‘Hout!’ said the driver.  ‘He keeps no servants here, man.  They’re a’ in\nthe town house; I drive him often; it’s just a kind of a hermitage,\nthis.’\n\n‘Give me the bell,’ said John; and he plucked at it like a man desperate.\n\nThe clamour had not yet subsided before they heard steps upon the gravel,\nand a voice of singular nervous irritability cried to them through the\ndoor, ‘Who are you, and what do you want?’\n\n‘Alan,’ said John, ‘it’s me—it’s Fatty—John, you know.  I’m just come\nhome, and I’ve come to stay with you.’\n\nThere was no reply for a moment, and then the door was opened.\n\n‘Get the portmanteau down,’ said John to the driver.\n\n‘Do nothing of the kind,’ said Alan; and then to John, ‘Come in here a\nmoment.  I want to speak to you.’\n\nJohn entered the garden, and the door was closed behind him.  A candle\nstood on the gravel walk, winking a little in the draughts; it threw\ninconstant sparkles on the clumped holly, struck the light and darkness\nto and fro like a veil on Alan’s features, and sent his shadow hovering\nbehind him.  All beyond was inscrutable; and John’s dizzy brain rocked\nwith the shadow.  Yet even so, it struck him that Alan was pale, and his\nvoice, when he spoke, unnatural.\n\n‘What brings you here to-night?’ he began.  ‘I don’t want, God knows, to\nseem unfriendly; but I cannot take you in, Nicholson; I cannot do it.’\n\n‘Alan,’ said John, ‘you’ve just got to!  You don’t know the mess I’m in;\nthe governor’s turned me out, and I daren’t show my face in an inn,\nbecause they’re down on me for murder or something!’\n\n‘For what?’ cried Alan, starting.\n\n‘Murder, I believe,’ says John.\n\n‘Murder!’ repeated Alan, and passed his hand over his eyes.  ‘What was\nthat you were saying?’ he asked again.\n\n‘That they were down on me,’ said John.  ‘I’m accused of murder, by what\nI can make out; and I’ve really had a dreadful day of it, Alan, and I\ncan’t sleep on the roadside on a night like this—at least, not with a\nportmanteau,’ he pleaded.\n\n‘Hush!’ said Alan, with his head on one side; and then, ‘Did you hear\nnothing?’ he asked.\n\n‘No,’ said John, thrilling, he knew not why, with communicated terror.\n‘No, I heard nothing; why?’  And then, as there was no answer, he\nreverted to his pleading: ‘But I say, Alan, you’ve just got to take me\nin.  I’ll go right away to bed if you have anything to do.  I seem to\nhave been drinking; I was that knocked over.  I wouldn’t turn you away,\nAlan, if you were down on your luck.’\n\n‘No?’ returned Alan.  ‘Neither will you, then.  Come and let’s get your\nportmanteau.’\n\nThe cabman was paid, and drove off down the long, lamp-lighted hill, and\nthe two friends stood on the side-walk beside the portmanteau till the\nlast rumble of the wheels had died in silence.  It seemed to John as\nthough Alan attached importance to this departure of the cab; and John,\nwho was in no state to criticise, shared profoundly in the feeling.\n\nWhen the stillness was once more perfect, Alan shouldered the\nportmanteau, carried it in, and shut and locked the garden door; and\nthen, once more, abstraction seemed to fall upon him, and he stood with\nhis hand on the key, until the cold began to nibble at John’s fingers.\n\n‘Why are we standing here?’ asked John.\n\n‘Eh?’ said Alan, blankly.\n\n‘Why, man, you don’t seem yourself,’ said the other.\n\n‘No, I’m not myself,’ said Alan; and he sat down on the portmanteau and\nput his face in his hands.\n\nJohn stood beside him swaying a little, and looking about him at the\nswaying shadows, the flitting sparkles, and the steady stars overhead,\nuntil the windless cold began to touch him through his clothes on the\nbare skin.  Even in his bemused intelligence, wonder began to awake.\n\n‘I say, let’s come on to the house,’ he said at last.\n\n‘Yes, let’s come on to the house,’ repeated Alan.\n\nAnd he rose at once, reshouldered the portmanteau, and taking the candle\nin his other hand, moved forward to the Lodge.  This was a long, low\nbuilding, smothered in creepers; and now, except for some chinks of light\nbetween the dining-room shutters, it was plunged in darkness and silence.\n\nIn the hall Alan lighted another candle, gave it to John, and opened the\ndoor of a bedroom.\n\n‘Here,’ said he; ‘go to bed.  Don’t mind me, John.  You’ll be sorry for\nme when you know.’\n\n‘Wait a bit,’ returned John; ‘I’ve got so cold with all that standing\nabout.  Let’s go into the dining-room a minute.  Just one glass to warm\nme, Alan.’\n\nOn the table in the hall stood a glass, and a bottle with a whisky label\non a tray.  It was plain the bottle had been just opened, for the cork\nand corkscrew lay beside it.\n\n‘Take that,’ said Alan, passing John the whisky, and then with a certain\nroughness pushed his friend into the bedroom, and closed the door behind\nhim.\n\nJohn stood amazed; then he shook the bottle, and, to his further wonder,\nfound it partly empty.  Three or four glasses were gone.  Alan must have\nuncorked a bottle of whisky and drank three or four glasses one after the\nother, without sitting down, for there was no chair, and that in his own\ncold lobby on this freezing night!  It fully explained his\neccentricities, John reflected sagely, as he mixed himself a grog.  Poor\nAlan!  He was drunk; and what a dreadful thing was drink, and what a\nslave to it poor Alan was, to drink in this unsociable, uncomfortable\nfashion!  The man who would drink alone, except for health’s sake—as John\nwas now doing—was a man utterly lost.  He took the grog out, and felt\nhazier, but warmer.  It was hard work opening the portmanteau and finding\nhis night things; and before he was undressed, the cold had struck home\nto him once more.  ‘Well,’ said he; ‘just a drop more.  There’s no sense\nin getting ill with all this other trouble.’  And presently dreamless\nslumber buried him.\n\nWhen John awoke it was day.  The low winter sun was already in the\nheavens, but his watch had stopped, and it was impossible to tell the\nhour exactly.  Ten, he guessed it, and made haste to dress, dismal\nreflections crowding on his mind.  But it was less from terror than from\nregret that he now suffered; and with his regret there were mingled\ncutting pangs of penitence.  There had fallen upon him a blow, cruel,\nindeed, but yet only the punishment of old misdoing; and he had rebelled\nand plunged into fresh sin.  The rod had been used to chasten, and he had\nbit the chastening fingers.  His father was right; John had justified\nhim; John was no guest for decent people’s houses, and no fit associate\nfor decent people’s children.  And had a broader hint been needed, there\nwas the case of his old friend.  John was no drunkard, though he could at\ntimes exceed; and the picture of Houston drinking neat spirits at his\nhall-table struck him with something like disgust.  He hung back from\nmeeting his old friend.  He could have wished he had not come to him; and\nyet, even now, where else was he to turn?\n\nThese musings occupied him while he dressed, and accompanied him into the\nlobby of the house.  The door stood open on the garden; doubtless, Alan\nhad stepped forth; and John did as he supposed his friend had done.  The\nground was hard as iron, the frost still rigorous; as he brushed among\nthe hollies, icicles jingled and glittered in their fall; and wherever he\nwent, a volley of eager sparrows followed him.  Here were Christmas\nweather and Christmas morning duly met, to the delight of children.  This\nwas the day of reunited families, the day to which he had so long looked\nforward, thinking to awake in his own bed in Randolph Crescent,\nreconciled with all men and repeating the footprints of his youth; and\nhere he was alone, pacing the alleys of a wintry garden and filled with\npenitential thoughts.\n\nAnd that reminded him: why was he alone? and where was Alan?  The thought\nof the festal morning and the due salutations reawakened his desire for\nhis friend, and he began to call for him by name.  As the sound of his\nvoice died away, he was aware of the greatness of the silence that\nenvironed him.  But for the twittering of the sparrows and the crunching\nof his own feet upon the frozen snow, the whole windless world of air\nhung over him entranced, and the stillness weighed upon his mind with a\nhorror of solitude.\n\nStill calling at intervals, but now with a moderated voice, he made the\nhasty circuit of the garden, and finding neither man nor trace of man in\nall its evergreen coverts, turned at last to the house.  About the house\nthe silence seemed to deepen strangely.  The door, indeed, stood open as\nbefore; but the windows were still shuttered, the chimneys breathed no\nstain into the bright air, there sounded abroad none of that low stir\n(perhaps audible rather to the ear of the spirit than to the ear of the\nflesh) by which a house announces and betrays its human lodgers.  And yet\nAlan must be there—Alan locked in drunken slumbers, forgetful of the\nreturn of day, of the holy season, and of the friend whom he had so\ncoldly received and was now so churlishly neglecting.  John’s disgust\nredoubled at the thought, but hunger was beginning to grow stronger than\nrepulsion, and as a step to breakfast, if nothing else, he must find and\narouse this sleeper.\n\nHe made the circuit of the bedroom quarters.  All, until he came to\nAlan’s chamber, were locked from without, and bore the marks of a\nprolonged disuse.  But Alan’s was a room in commission, filled with\nclothes, knickknacks, letters, books, and the conveniences of a solitary\nman.  The fire had been lighted; but it had long ago burned out, and the\nashes were stone cold.  The bed had been made, but it had not been slept\nin.\n\nWorse and worse, then; Alan must have fallen where he sat, and now\nsprawled brutishly, no doubt, upon the dining-room floor.\n\nThe dining-room was a very long apartment, and was reached through a\npassage; so that John, upon his entrance, brought but little light with\nhim, and must move toward the windows with spread arms, groping and\nknocking on the furniture.  Suddenly he tripped and fell his length over\na prostrate body.  It was what he had looked for, yet it shocked him; and\nhe marvelled that so rough an impact should not have kicked a groan out\nof the drunkard.  Men had killed themselves ere now in such excesses, a\ndreary and degraded end that made John shudder.  What if Alan were dead?\nThere would be a Christmas-day!\n\nBy this, John had his hand upon the shutters, and flinging them back,\nbeheld once again the blessed face of the day.  Even by that light the\nroom had a discomfortable air.  The chairs were scattered, and one had\nbeen overthrown; the table-cloth, laid as if for dinner, was twitched\nupon one side, and some of the dishes had fallen to the floor.  Behind\nthe table lay the drunkard, still unaroused, only one foot visible to\nJohn.\n\nBut now that light was in the room, the worst seemed over; it was a\ndisgusting business, but not more than disgusting; and it was with no\ngreat apprehension that John proceeded to make the circuit of the table:\nhis last comparatively tranquil moment for that day.  No sooner had he\nturned the corner, no sooner had his eyes alighted on the body, than he\ngave a smothered, breathless cry, and fled out of the room and out of the\nhouse.\n\nIt was not Alan who lay there, but a man well up in years, of stern\ncountenance and iron-grey locks; and it was no drunkard, for the body lay\nin a black pool of blood, and the open eyes stared upon the ceiling.\n\nTo and fro walked John before the door.  The extreme sharpness of the air\nacted on his nerves like an astringent, and braced them swiftly.\nPresently, he not relaxing in his disordered walk, the images began to\ncome clearer and stay longer in his fancy; and next the power of thought\ncame back to him, and the horror and danger of his situation rooted him\nto the ground.\n\nHe grasped his forehead, and staring on one spot of gravel, pieced\ntogether what he knew and what he suspected.  Alan had murdered some one:\npossibly ‘that man’ against whom the butler chained the door in Regent\nTerrace; possibly another; some one at least: a human soul, whom it was\ndeath to slay and whose blood lay spilled upon the floor.  This was the\nreason of the whisky drinking in the passage, of his unwillingness to\nwelcome John, of his strange behaviour and bewildered words; this was why\nhe had started at and harped upon the name of murder; this was why he had\nstood and hearkened, or sat and covered his eyes, in the black night.\nAnd now he was gone, now he had basely fled; and to all his perplexities\nand dangers John stood heir.\n\n‘Let me think—let me think,’ he said, aloud, impatiently, even\npleadingly, as if to some merciless interrupter.  In the turmoil of his\nwits, a thousand hints and hopes and threats and terrors dinning\ncontinuously in his ears, he was like one plunged in the hubbub of a\ncrowd.  How was he to remember—he, who had not a thought to spare—that he\nwas himself the author, as well as the theatre, of so much confusion?\nBut in hours of trial the junto of man’s nature is dissolved, and anarchy\nsucceeds.\n\nIt was plain he must stay no longer where he was, for here was a new\nJudicial Error in the very making.  It was not so plain where he must go,\nfor the old Judicial Error, vague as a cloud, appeared to fill the\nhabitable world; whatever it might be, it watched for him, full-grown, in\nEdinburgh; it must have had its birth in San Francisco; it stood guard,\nno doubt, like a dragon, at the bank where he should cash his credit; and\nthough there were doubtless many other places, who should say in which of\nthem it was not ambushed?  No, he could not tell where he was to go; he\nmust not lose time on these insolubilities.  Let him go back to the\nbeginning.  It was plain he must stay no longer where he was.  It was\nplain, too, that he must not flee as he was, for he could not carry his\nportmanteau, and to flee and leave it was to plunge deeper in the mire.\nHe must go, leave the house unguarded, find a cab, and return—return\nafter an absence?  Had he courage for that?\n\nAnd just then he spied a stain about a hand’s-breadth on his trouser-leg,\nand reached his finger down to touch it.  The finger was stained red: it\nwas blood; he stared upon it with disgust, and awe, and terror, and in\nthe sharpness of the new sensation, fell instantly to act.\n\nHe cleansed his finger in the snow, returned into the house, drew near\nwith hushed footsteps to the dining-room door, and shut and locked it.\nThen he breathed a little freer, for here at least was an oaken barrier\nbetween himself and what he feared.  Next, he hastened to his room, tore\noff the spotted trousers which seemed in his eyes a link to bind him to\nthe gallows, flung them in a corner, donned another pair, breathlessly\ncrammed his night things into his portmanteau, locked it, swung it with\nan effort from the ground, and with a rush of relief, came forth again\nunder the open heavens.\n\nThe portmanteau, being of occidental build, was no feather-weight; it had\ndistressed the powerful Alan; and as for John, he was crushed under its\nbulk, and the sweat broke upon him thickly.  Twice he must set it down to\nrest before he reached the gate; and when he had come so far, he must do\nas Alan did, and take his seat upon one corner.  Here then, he sat a\nwhile and panted; but now his thoughts were sensibly lightened; now, with\nthe trunk standing just inside the door, some part of his dissociation\nfrom the house of crime had been effected, and the cabman need not pass\nthe garden wall.  It was wonderful how that relieved him; for the house,\nin his eyes, was a place to strike the most cursory beholder with\nsuspicion, as though the very windows had cried murder.\n\nBut there was to be no remission of the strokes of fate.  As he thus sat,\ntaking breath in the shadow of the wall and hopped about by sparrows, it\nchanced that his eye roved to the fastening of the door; and what he saw\nplucked him to his feet.  The thing locked with a spring; once the door\nwas closed, the bolt shut of itself; and without a key, there was no\nmeans of entering from without.\n\nHe saw himself obliged to one of two distasteful and perilous\nalternatives; either to shut the door altogether and set his portmanteau\nout upon the wayside, a wonder to all beholders; or to leave the door\najar, so that any thievish tramp or holiday schoolboy might stray in and\nstumble on the grisly secret.  To the last, as the least desperate, his\nmind inclined; but he must first insure himself that he was unobserved.\nHe peered out, and down the long road; it lay dead empty.  He went to the\ncorner of the by-road that comes by way of Dean; there also not a\npassenger was stirring.  Plainly it was, now or never, the high tide of\nhis affairs; and he drew the door as close as he durst, slipped a pebble\nin the chink, and made off downhill to find a cab.\n\nHalf-way down a gate opened, and a troop of Christmas children sallied\nforth in the most cheerful humour, followed more soberly by a smiling\nmother.\n\n‘And this is Christmas-day!’ thought John; and could have laughed aloud\nin tragic bitterness of heart.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—A TRAGI-COMEDY IN A CAB\n\n\nIN front of Donaldson’s Hospital, John counted it good fortune to\nperceive a cab a great way of, and by much shouting and waving of his\narm, to catch the notice of the driver.  He counted it good fortune, for\nthe time was long to him till he should have done for ever with the\nLodge; and the further he must go to find a cab, the greater the chance\nthat the inevitable discovery had taken place, and that he should return\nto find the garden full of angry neighbours.  Yet when the vehicle drew\nup he was sensibly chagrined to recognise the port-wine cabman of the\nnight before.  ‘Here,’ he could not but reflect, ‘here is another link in\nthe Judicial Error.’\n\nThe driver, on the other hand, was pleased to drop again upon so liberal\na fare; and as he was a man—the reader must already have perceived—of\neasy, not to say familiar, manners, he dropped at once into a vein of\nfriendly talk, commenting on the weather, on the sacred season, which\nstruck him chiefly in the light of a day of liberal gratuities, on the\nchance which had reunited him to a pleasing customer, and on the fact\nthat John had been (as he was pleased to call it) visibly ‘on the randan’\nthe night before.\n\n‘And ye look dreidful bad the-day, sir, I must say that,’ he continued.\n‘There’s nothing like a dram for ye—if ye’ll take my advice of it; and\nbein’ as it’s Christmas, I’m no’ saying,’ he added, with a fatherly\nsmile, ‘but what I would join ye mysel’.’\n\nJohn had listened with a sick heart.\n\n‘I’ll give you a dram when we’ve got through,’ said he, affecting a\nsprightliness which sat on him most unhandsomely, ‘and not a drop till\nthen.  Business first, and pleasure afterward.’\n\nWith this promise the jarvey was prevailed upon to clamber to his place\nand drive, with hideous deliberation, to the door of the Lodge.  There\nwere no signs as yet of any public emotion; only, two men stood not far\noff in talk, and their presence, seen from afar, set John’s pulses\nbuzzing.  He might have spared himself his fright, for the pair were lost\nin some dispute of a theological complexion, and with lengthened upper\nlip and enumerating fingers, pursued the matter of their difference, and\npaid no heed to John.\n\nBut the cabman proved a thorn in the flesh.\n\nNothing would keep him on his perch; he must clamber down, comment upon\nthe pebble in the door (which he regarded as an ingenious but unsafe\ndevice), help John with the portmanteau, and enliven matters with a flow\nof speech, and especially of questions, which I thus condense:—\n\n‘He’ll no’ be here himsel’, will he?  No?  Well, he’s an eccentric man—a\nfair oddity—if ye ken the expression.  Great trouble with his tenants,\nthey tell me.  I’ve driven the fam’ly for years.  I drove a cab at his\nfather’s waddin’.  What’ll your name be?—I should ken your face.\nBaigrey, ye say?  There were Baigreys about Gilmerton; ye’ll be one of\nthat lot?  Then this’ll be a friend’s portmantie, like?  Why?  Because\nthe name upon it’s Nucholson!  Oh, if ye’re in a hurry, that’s another\njob.  Waverley Brig?  Are ye for away?’\n\nSo the friendly toper prated and questioned and kept John’s heart in a\nflutter.  But to this also, as to other evils under the sun, there came a\nperiod; and the victim of circumstances began at last to rumble toward\nthe railway terminus at Waverley Bridge.  During the transit, he sat with\nraised glasses in the frosty chill and mouldy fetor of his chariot, and\nglanced out sidelong on the holiday face of things, the shuttered shops,\nand the crowds along the pavement, much as the rider in the Tyburn cart\nmay have observed the concourse gathering to his execution.\n\nAt the station his spirits rose again; another stage of his escape was\nfortunately ended—he began to spy blue water.  He called a railway\nporter, and bade him carry the portmanteau to the cloak-room: not that he\nhad any notion of delay; flight, instant flight was his design, no matter\nwhither; but he had determined to dismiss the cabman ere he named, or\neven chose, his destination, thus possibly balking the Judicial Error of\nanother link.  This was his cunning aim, and now with one foot on the\nroadway, and one still on the coach-step, he made haste to put the thing\nin practice, and plunged his hand into his trousers pocket.\n\nThere was nothing there!\n\nOh yes; this time he was to blame.  He should have remembered, and when\nhe deserted his blood-stained pantaloons, he should not have deserted\nalong with them his purse.  Make the most of his error, and then compare\nit with the punishment!  Conceive his new position, for I lack words to\npicture it; conceive him condemned to return to that house, from the very\nthought of which his soul revolted, and once more to expose himself to\ncapture on the very scene of the misdeed: conceive him linked to the\nmouldy cab and the familiar cabman.  John cursed the cabman silently, and\nthen it occurred to him that he must stop the incarceration of his\nportmanteau; that, at least, he must keep close at hand, and he turned to\nrecall the porter.  But his reflections, brief as they had appeared, must\nhave occupied him longer than he supposed, and there was the man already\nreturning with the receipt.\n\nWell, that was settled; he had lost his portmanteau also; for the\nsixpence with which he had paid the Murrayfield Toll was one that had\nstrayed alone into his waistcoat pocket, and unless he once more\nsuccessfully achieved the adventure of the house of crime, his\nportmanteau lay in the cloakroom in eternal pawn, for lack of a penny\nfee.  And then he remembered the porter, who stood suggestively\nattentive, words of gratitude hanging on his lips.\n\nJohn hunted right and left; he found a coin—prayed God that it was a\nsovereign—drew it out, beheld a halfpenny, and offered it to the porter.\n\nThe man’s jaw dropped.\n\n‘It’s only a halfpenny!’ he said, startled out of railway decency.\n\n‘I know that,’ said John, piteously.\n\nAnd here the porter recovered the dignity of man.\n\n‘Thank you, sir,’ said he, and would have returned the base gratuity.\nBut John, too, would none of it; and as they struggled, who must join in\nbut the cabman?\n\n‘Hoots, Mr. Baigrey,’ said he, ‘you surely forget what day it is!’\n\n‘I tell you I have no change!’ cried John.\n\n‘Well,’ said the driver, ‘and what then?  I would rather give a man a\nshillin’ on a day like this than put him off with a derision like a\nbawbee.  I’m surprised at the like of you, Mr. Baigrey!’\n\n‘My name is not Baigrey!’ broke out John, in mere childish temper and\ndistress.\n\n‘Ye told me it was yoursel’,’ said the cabman.\n\n‘I know I did; and what the devil right had you to ask?’ cried the\nunhappy one.\n\n‘Oh, very well,’ said the driver.  ‘I know my place, if you know yours—if\nyou know yours!’ he repeated, as one who should imply grave doubt; and\nmuttered inarticulate thunders, in which the grand old name of gentleman\nwas taken seemingly in vain.\n\nOh to have been able to discharge this monster, whom John now perceived,\nwith tardy clear-sightedness, to have begun betimes the festivities of\nChristmas!  But far from any such ray of consolation visiting the lost,\nhe stood bare of help and helpers, his portmanteau sequestered in one\nplace, his money deserted in another and guarded by a corpse; himself, so\nsedulous of privacy, the cynosure of all men’s eyes about the station;\nand, as if these were not enough mischances, he was now fallen in\nill-blood with the beast to whom his poverty had linked him!  In\nill-blood, as he reflected dismally, with the witness who perhaps might\nhang or save him!  There was no time to be lost; he durst not linger any\nlonger in that public spot; and whether he had recourse to dignity or\nconciliation, the remedy must be applied at once.  Some happily surviving\nelement of manhood moved him to the former.\n\n‘Let us have no more of this,’ said he, his foot once more upon the step.\n‘Go back to where we came from.’\n\nHe had avoided the name of any destination, for there was now quite a\nlittle band of railway folk about the cab, and he still kept an eye upon\nthe court of justice, and laboured to avoid concentric evidence.  But\nhere again the fatal jarvey out-manoeuvred him.\n\n‘Back to the Ludge?’ cried he, in shrill tones of protest.\n\n‘Drive on at once!’ roared John, and slammed the door behind him, so that\nthe crazy chariot rocked and jingled.\n\nForth trundled the cab into the Christmas streets, the fare within\nplunged in the blackness of a despair that neighboured on\nunconsciousness, the driver on the box digesting his rebuke and his\ncustomer’s duplicity.  I would not be thought to put the pair in\ncompetition; John’s case was out of all parallel.  But the cabman, too,\nis worth the sympathy of the judicious; for he was a fellow of genuine\nkindliness and a high sense of personal dignity incensed by drink; and\nhis advances had been cruelly and publicly rebuffed.  As he drove,\ntherefore, he counted his wrongs, and thirsted for sympathy and drink.\nNow, it chanced he had a friend, a publican in Queensferry Street, from\nwhom, in view of the sacredness of the occasion, he thought he might\nextract a dram.  Queensferry Street lies something off the direct road to\nMurrayfield.  But then there is the hilly cross-road that passes by the\nvalley of the Leith and the Dean Cemetery; and Queensferry Street is on\nthe way to that.  What was to hinder the cabman, since his horse was\ndumb, from choosing the cross-road, and calling on his friend in passing?\nSo it was decided; and the charioteer, already somewhat mollified, turned\naside his horse to the right.\n\nJohn, meanwhile, sat collapsed, his chin sunk upon his chest, his mind in\nabeyance.  The smell of the cab was still faintly present to his senses,\nand a certain leaden chill about his feet, all else had disappeared in\none vast oppression of calamity and physical faintness.  It was drawing\non to noon—two-and-twenty hours since he had broken bread; in the\ninterval, he had suffered tortures of sorrow and alarm, and been partly\ntipsy; and though it was impossible to say he slept, yet when the cab\nstopped and the cabman thrust his head into the window, his attention had\nto be recalled from depths of vacancy.\n\n‘If you’ll no’ _stand_ me a dram,’ said the driver, with a well-merited\nseverity of tone and manner, ‘I dare say ye’ll have no objection to my\ntaking one mysel’?’\n\n‘Yes—no—do what you like,’ returned John; and then, as he watched his\ntormentor mount the stairs and enter the whisky-shop, there floated into\nhis mind a sense as of something long ago familiar.  At that he started\nfully awake, and stared at the shop-fronts.  Yes, he knew them; but when?\nand how?  Long since, he thought; and then, casting his eye through the\nfront glass, which had been recently occluded by the figure of the\njarvey, he beheld the tree-tops of the rookery in Randolph Crescent.  He\nwas close to home—home, where he had thought, at that hour, to be sitting\nin the well-remembered drawing-room in friendly converse; and, instead—!\n\nIt was his first impulse to drop into the bottom of the cab; his next, to\ncover his face with his hands.  So he sat, while the cabman toasted the\npublican, and the publican toasted the cabman, and both reviewed the\naffairs of the nation; so he still sat, when his master condescended to\nreturn, and drive off at last down-hill, along the curve of Lynedoch\nPlace; but even so sitting, as he passed the end of his father’s street,\nhe took one glance from between shielding fingers, and beheld a doctor’s\ncarriage at the door.\n\n‘Well, just so,’ thought he; ‘I’ll have killed my father!  And this is\nChristmas-day!’\n\nIf Mr. Nicholson died, it was down this same road he must journey to the\ngrave; and down this road, on the same errand, his wife had preceded him\nyears before; and many other leading citizens, with the proper trappings\nand attendance of the end.  And now, in that frosty, ill-smelling,\nstraw-carpeted, and ragged-cushioned cab, with his breath congealing on\nthe glasses, where else was John himself advancing to?\n\nThe thought stirred his imagination, which began to manufacture many\nthousand pictures, bright and fleeting, like the shapes in a\nkaleidoscope; and now he saw himself, ruddy and comfortered, sliding in\nthe gutter; and, again, a little woe-begone, bored urchin tricked forth\nin crape and weepers, descending this same hill at the foot’s pace of\nmourning coaches, his mother’s body just preceding him; and yet again,\nhis fancy, running far in front, showed him his destination—now standing\nsolitary in the low sunshine, with the sparrows hopping on the threshold\nand the dead man within staring at the roof—and now, with a sudden\nchange, thronged about with white-faced, hand-uplifting neighbours, and\ndoctor bursting through their midst and fixing his stethoscope as he\nwent, the policeman shaking a sagacious head beside the body.  It was to\nthis he feared that he was driving; in the midst of this he saw himself\narrive, heard himself stammer faint explanations, and felt the hand of\nthe constable upon his shoulder.  Heavens! how he wished he had played\nthe manlier part; how he despised himself that he had fled that fatal\nneighbourhood when all was quiet, and should now be tamely travelling\nback when it was thronging with avengers!\n\nAny strong degree of passion lends, even to the dullest, the forces of\nthe imagination.  And so now as he dwelt on what was probably awaiting\nhim at the end of this distressful drive—John, who saw things little,\nremembered them less, and could not have described them at all, beheld in\nhis mind’s-eye the garden of the Lodge, detailed as in a map; he went to\nand fro in it, feeding his terrors; he saw the hollies, the snowy\nborders, the paths where he had sought Alan, the high, conventual walls,\nthe shut door—what! was the door shut?  Ay, truly, he had shut it—shut in\nhis money, his escape, his future life—shut it with these hands, and none\ncould now open it!  He heard the snap of the spring-lock like something\nbursting in his brain, and sat astonied.\n\nAnd then he woke again, terror jarring through his vitals.  This was no\ntime to be idle; he must be up and doing, he must think.  Once at the end\nof this ridiculous cruise, once at the Lodge door, there would be nothing\nfor it but to turn the cab and trundle back again.  Why, then, go so far?\nwhy add another feature of suspicion to a case already so suggestive? why\nnot turn at once?  It was easy to say, turn; but whither?  He had nowhere\nnow to go to; he could never—he saw it in letters of blood—he could never\npay that cab; he was saddled with that cab for ever.  Oh that cab! his\nsoul yearned and burned, and his bowels sounded to be rid of it.  He\nforgot all other cares.  He must first quit himself of this ill-smelling\nvehicle and of the human beast that guided it—first do that; do that, at\nleast; do that at once.\n\nAnd just then the cab suddenly stopped, and there was his persecutor\nrapping on the front glass.  John let it down, and beheld the port-wine\ncountenance inflamed with intellectual triumph.\n\n‘I ken wha ye are!’ cried the husky voice.  ‘I mind ye now.  Ye’re a\nNucholson.  I drove ye to Hermiston to a Christmas party, and ye came\nback on the box, and I let ye drive.’\n\nIt is a fact.  John knew the man; they had been even friends.  His enemy,\nhe now remembered, was a fellow of great good nature—endless good\nnature—with a boy; why not with a man?  Why not appeal to his better\nside?  He grasped at the new hope.\n\n‘Great Scott! and so you did,’ he cried, as if in a transport of delight,\nhis voice sounding false in his own ears.  ‘Well, if that’s so, I’ve\nsomething to say to you.  I’ll just get out, I guess.  Where are we, any\nway?’\n\nThe driver had fluttered his ticket in the eyes of the branch-toll\nkeeper, and they were now brought to on the highest and most solitary\npart of the by-road.  On the left, a row of fieldside trees beshaded it;\non the right, it was bordered by naked fallows, undulating down-hill to\nthe Queensferry Road; in front, Corstorphine Hill raised its\nsnow-bedabbled, darkling woods against the sky.  John looked all about\nhim, drinking the clear air like wine; then his eyes returned to the\ncabman’s face as he sat, not ungleefully, awaiting John’s communication,\nwith the air of one looking to be tipped.\n\nThe features of that face were hard to read, drink had so swollen them,\ndrink had so painted them, in tints that varied from brick-red to\nmulberry.  The small grey eyes blinked, the lips moved, with greed; greed\nwas the ruling passion; and though there was some good nature, some\ngenuine kindliness, a true human touch, in the old toper, his greed was\nnow so set afire by hope, that all other traits of character lay dormant.\nHe sat there a monument of gluttonous desire.\n\nJohn’s heart slowly fell.  He had opened his lips, but he stood there and\nuttered nought.  He sounded the well of his courage, and it was dry.  He\ngroped in his treasury of words, and it was vacant.  A devil of dumbness\nhad him by the throat; the devil of terror babbled in his ears; and\nsuddenly, without a word uttered, with no conscious purpose formed in his\nwill, John whipped about, tumbled over the roadside wall, and began\nrunning for his life across the fallows.\n\nHe had not gone far, he was not past the midst of the first afield, when\nhis whole brain thundered within him, ‘Fool!  You have your watch!’  The\nshock stopped him, and he faced once more toward the cab.  The driver was\nleaning over the wall, brandishing his whip, his face empurpled, roaring\nlike a bull.  And John saw (or thought) that he had lost the chance.  No\nwatch would pacify the man’s resentment now; he would cry for vengeance\nalso.  John would be had under the eye of the police; his tale would be\nunfolded, his secret plumbed, his destiny would close on him at last, and\nfor ever.\n\nHe uttered a deep sigh; and just as the cabman, taking heart of grace,\nwas beginning at last to scale the wall, his defaulting customer fell\nagain to running, and disappeared into the further fields.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—SINGULAR INSTANCE OF THE UTILITY OF PASS-KEYS\n\n\nWHERE he ran at first, John never very clearly knew; nor yet how long a\ntime elapsed ere he found himself in the by-road near the lodge of\nRavelston, propped against the wall, his lungs heaving like bellows, his\nlegs leaden-heavy, his mind possessed by one sole desire—to lie down and\nbe unseen.  He remembered the thick coverts round the quarry-hole pond,\nan untrodden corner of the world where he might surely find concealment\ntill the night should fall.  Thither he passed down the lane; and when he\ncame there, behold! he had forgotten the frost, and the pond was alive\nwith young people skating, and the pond-side coverts were thick with\nlookers-on.  He looked on a while himself.  There was one tall, graceful\nmaiden, skating hand in hand with a youth, on whom she bestowed her\nbright eyes perhaps too patently; and it was strange with what anger John\nbeheld her.  He could have broken forth in curses; he could have stood\nthere, like a mortified tramp, and shaken his fist and vented his gall\nupon her by the hour—or so he thought; and the next moment his heart bled\nfor the girl.  ‘Poor creature, it’s little she knows!’ he sighed.  ‘Let\nher enjoy herself while she can!’  But was it possible, when Flora used\nto smile at him on the Braid ponds, she could have looked so fulsome to a\nsick-hearted bystander?\n\nThe thought of one quarry, in his frozen wits, suggested another; and he\nplodded off toward Craigleith.  A wind had sprung up out of the\nnorth-west; it was cruel keen, it dried him like a fire, and racked his\nfinger-joints.  It brought clouds, too; pale, swift, hurrying clouds,\nthat blotted heaven and shed gloom upon the earth.  He scrambled up among\nthe hazelled rubbish heaps that surround the caldron of the quarry, and\nlay flat upon the stones.  The wind searched close along the earth, the\nstones were cutting and icy, the bare hazels wailed about him; and soon\nthe air of the afternoon began to be vocal with those strange and dismal\nharpings that herald snow.  Pain and misery turned in John’s limbs to a\nharrowing impatience and blind desire of change; now he would roll in his\nharsh lair, and when the flints abraded him, was almost pleased; now he\nwould crawl to the edge of the huge pit and look dizzily down.  He saw\nthe spiral of the descending roadway, the steep crags, the clinging\nbushes, the peppering of snow-wreaths, and far down in the bottom, the\ndiminished crane.  Here, no doubt, was a way to end it.  But it somehow\ndid not take his fancy.\n\nAnd suddenly he was aware that he was hungry; ay, even through the\ntortures of the cold, even through the frosts of despair, a gross,\ndesperate longing after food, no matter what, no matter how, began to\nwake and spur him.  Suppose he pawned his watch?  But no, on\nChristmas-day—this was Christmas-day!—the pawnshop would be closed.\nSuppose he went to the public-house close by at Blackhall, and offered\nthe watch, which was worth ten pounds, in payment for a meal of bread and\ncheese?  The incongruity was too remarkable; the good folks would either\nput him to the door, or only let him in to send for the police.  He\nturned his pockets out one after another; some San Francisco tram-car\nchecks, one cigar, no lights, the pass-key to his father’s house, a\npocket-handkerchief, with just a touch of scent: no, money could be\nraised on none of these.  There was nothing for it but to starve; and\nafter all, what mattered it?  That also was a door of exit.\n\nHe crept close among the bushes, the wind playing round him like a lash;\nhis clothes seemed thin as paper, his joints burned, his skin curdled on\nhis bones.  He had a vision of a high-lying cattle-drive in California,\nand the bed of a dried stream with one muddy pool, by which the vaqueros\nhad encamped: splendid sun over all, the big bonfire blazing, the strips\nof cow browning and smoking on a skewer of wood; how warm it was, how\nsavoury the steam of scorching meat!  And then again he remembered his\nmanifold calamities, and burrowed and wallowed in the sense of his\ndisgrace and shame.  And next he was entering Frank’s restaurant in\nMontgomery Street, San Francisco; he had ordered a pan-stew and venison\nchops, of which he was immoderately fond, and as he sat waiting, Munroe,\nthe good attendant, brought him a whisky punch; he saw the strawberries\nfloat on the delectable cup, he heard the ice chink about the straws.\nAnd then he woke again to his detested fate, and found himself sitting,\nhumped together, in a windy combe of quarry refuse—darkness thick about\nhim, thin flakes of snow flying here and there like rags of paper, and\nthe strong shuddering of his body clashing his teeth like a hiccough.\n\nWe have seen John in nothing but the stormiest condition; we have seen\nhim reckless, desperate, tried beyond his moderate powers; of his daily\nself, cheerful, regular, not unthrifty, we have seen nothing; and it may\nthus be a surprise to the reader to learn that he was studiously careful\nof his health.  This favourite preoccupation now awoke.  If he were to\nsit there and die of cold, there would be mighty little gained; better\nthe police cell and the chances of a jury trial, than the miserable\ncertainty of death at a dyke-side before the next winter’s dawn, or death\na little later in the gas-lighted wards of an infirmary.\n\nHe rose on aching legs, and stumbled here and there among the rubbish\nheaps, still circumvented by the yawning crater of the quarry; or perhaps\nhe only thought so, for the darkness was already dense, the snow was\ngrowing thicker, and he moved like a blind man, and with a blind man’s\nterrors.  At last he climbed a fence, thinking to drop into the road, and\nfound himself staggering, instead, among the iron furrows of a\nploughland, endless, it seemed, as a whole county.  And next he was in a\nwood, beating among young trees; and then he was aware of a house with\nmany lighted windows, Christmas carriages waiting at the doors, and\nChristmas drivers (for Christmas has a double edge) becoming swiftly\nhooded with snow.  From this glimpse of human cheerfulness, he fled like\nCain; wandered in the night, unpiloted, careless of whither he went;\nfell, and lay, and then rose again and wandered further; and at last,\nlike a transformation scene, behold him in the lighted jaws of the city,\nstaring at a lamp which had already donned the tilted night-cap of the\nsnow.  It came thickly now, a ‘Feeding Storm’; and while he yet stood\nblinking at the lamp, his feet were buried.  He remembered something like\nit in the past, a street-lamp crowned and caked upon the windward side\nwith snow, the wind uttering its mournful hoot, himself looking on, even\nas now; but the cold had struck too sharply on his wits, and memory\nfailed him as to the date and sequel of the reminiscence.\n\nHis next conscious moment was on the Dean Bridge; but whether he was John\nNicholson of a bank in a California street, or some former John, a clerk\nin his father’s office, he had now clean forgotten.  Another blank, and\nhe was thrusting his pass-key into the door-lock of his father’s house.\n\nHours must have passed.  Whether crouched on the cold stones or wandering\nin the fields among the snow, was more than he could tell; but hours had\npassed.  The finger of the hall clock was close on twelve; a narrow peep\nof gas in the hall-lamp shed shadows; and the door of the back room—his\nfather’s room—was open and emitted a warm light.  At so late an hour, all\nthis was strange; the lights should have been out, the doors locked, the\ngood folk safe in bed.  He marvelled at the irregularity, leaning on the\nhall-table; and marvelled to himself there; and thawed and grew once more\nhungry, in the warmer air of the house.\n\nThe clock uttered its premonitory catch; in five minutes Christmas-day\nwould be among the days of the past—Christmas!—what a Christmas!  Well,\nthere was no use waiting; he had come into that house, he scarce knew\nhow; if they were to thrust him forth again, it had best be done at once;\nand he moved to the door of the back room and entered.\n\nOh, well, then he was insane, as he had long believed.\n\nThere, in his father’s room, at midnight, the fire was roaring and the\ngas blazing; the papers, the sacred papers—to lay a hand on which was\ncriminal—had all been taken off and piled along the floor; a cloth was\nspread, and a supper laid, upon the business table; and in his father’s\nchair a woman, habited like a nun, sat eating.  As he appeared in the\ndoorway, the nun rose, gave a low cry, and stood staring.  She was a\nlarge woman, strong, calm, a little masculine, her features marked with\ncourage and good sense; and as John blinked back at her, a faint\nresemblance dodged about his memory, as when a tune haunts us, and yet\nwill not be recalled.\n\n‘Why, it’s John!’ cried the nun.\n\n‘I dare say I’m mad,’ said John, unconsciously following King Lear; ‘but,\nupon my word, I do believe you’re Flora.’\n\n‘Of course I am,’ replied she.\n\nAnd yet it is not Flora at all, thought John; Flora was slender, and\ntimid, and of changing colour, and dewy-eyed; and had Flora such an\nEdinburgh accent?  But he said none of these things, which was perhaps as\nwell.  What he said was, ‘Then why are you a nun?’\n\n‘Such nonsense!’ said Flora.  ‘I’m a sick-nurse; and I am here nursing\nyour sister, with whom, between you and me, there is precious little the\nmatter.  But that is not the question.  The point is: How do you come\nhere? and are you not ashamed to show yourself?’\n\n‘Flora,’ said John, sepulchrally, ‘I haven’t eaten anything for three\ndays.  Or, at least, I don’t know what day it is; but I guess I’m\nstarving.’\n\n‘You unhappy man!’ she cried.  ‘Here, sit down and eat my supper; and\nI’ll just run upstairs and see my patient; not but what I doubt she’s\nfast asleep, for Maria is a _malade imaginaire_.’\n\nWith this specimen of the French, not of Stratford-atte-Bowe, but of a\nfinishing establishment in Moray Place, she left John alone in his\nfather’s sanctum.  He fell at once upon the food; and it is to be\nsupposed that Flora had found her patient wakeful, and been detained with\nsome details of nursing, for he had time to make a full end of all there\nwas to eat, and not only to empty the teapot, but to fill it again from a\nkettle that was fitfully singing on his father’s fire.  Then he sat\ntorpid, and pleased, and bewildered; his misfortunes were then half\nforgotten; his mind considering, not without regret, this unsentimental\nreturn to his old love.\n\nHe was thus engaged, when that bustling woman noiselessly re-entered.\n\n‘Have you eaten?’ said she.  ‘Then tell me all about it.’\n\nIt was a long and (as the reader knows) a pitiful story; but Flora heard\nit with compressed lips.  She was lost in none of those questionings of\nhuman destiny that have, from time to time, arrested the flight of my own\npen; for women, such as she, are no philosophers, and behold the concrete\nonly.  And women, such as she, are very hard on the imperfect man.\n\n‘Very well,’ said she, when he had done; ‘then down upon your knees at\nonce, and beg God’s forgiveness.’\n\nAnd the great baby plumped upon his knees, and did as he was bid; and\nnone the worse for that!  But while he was heartily enough requesting\nforgiveness on general principles, the rational side of him\ndistinguished, and wondered if, perhaps, the apology were not due upon\nthe other part.  And when he rose again from that becoming exercise, he\nfirst eyed the face of his old love doubtfully, and then, taking heart,\nuttered his protest.\n\n‘I must say, Flora,’ said he, ‘in all this business, I can see very\nlittle fault of mine.’\n\n‘If you had written home,’ replied the lady, ‘there would have been none\nof it.  If you had even gone to Murrayfield reasonably sober, you would\nnever have slept there, and the worst would not have happened.  Besides,\nthe whole thing began years ago.  You got into trouble, and when your\nfather, honest man, was disappointed, you took the pet, or got afraid,\nand ran away from punishment.  Well, you’ve had your own way of it, John,\nand I don’t suppose you like it.’\n\n‘I sometimes fancy I’m not much better than a fool,’ sighed John.\n\n‘My dear John,’ said she, ‘not much!’\n\nHe looked at her, and his eye fell.  A certain anger rose within him;\nhere was a Flora he disowned; she was hard; she was of a set colour; a\nsettled, mature, undecorative manner; plain of speech, plain of habit—he\nhad come near saying, plain of face.  And this changeling called herself\nby the same name as the many-coloured, clinging maid of yore; she of the\nfrequent laughter, and the many sighs, and the kind, stolen glances.  And\nto make all worse, she took the upper hand with him, which (as John well\nknew) was not the true relation of the sexes.  He steeled his heart\nagainst this sick-nurse.\n\n‘And how do you come to be here?’ he asked.\n\nShe told him how she had nursed her father in his long illness, and when\nhe died, and she was left alone, had taken to nurse others, partly from\nhabit, partly to be of some service in the world; partly, it might be,\nfor amusement.  ‘There’s no accounting for taste,’ said she.  And she\ntold him how she went largely to the houses of old friends, as the need\narose; and how she was thus doubly welcome as an old friend first, and\nthen as an experienced nurse, to whom doctors would confide the gravest\ncases.\n\n‘And, indeed, it’s a mere farce my being here for poor Maria,’ she\ncontinued; ‘but your father takes her ailments to heart, and I cannot\nalways be refusing him.  We are great friends, your father and I; he was\nvery kind to me long ago—ten years ago.\n\nA strange stir came in John’s heart.  All this while had he been thinking\nonly of himself?  All this while, why had he not written to Flora?  In\npenitential tenderness, he took her hand, and, to his awe and trouble, it\nremained in his, compliant.  A voice told him this was Flora, after\nall—told him so quietly, yet with a thrill of singing.\n\n‘And you never married?’ said he.\n\n‘No, John; I never married,’ she replied.\n\nThe hall clock striking two recalled them to the sense of time.\n\n‘And now,’ said she, ‘you have been fed and warmed, and I have heard your\nstory, and now it’s high time to call your brother.’\n\n‘Oh!’ cried John, chap-fallen; ‘do you think that absolutely necessary?’\n\n‘_I_ can’t keep you here; I am a stranger,’ said she.  ‘Do you want to\nrun away again?  I thought you had enough of that.’\n\nHe bowed his head under the reproof.  She despised him, he reflected, as\nhe sat once more alone; a monstrous thing for a woman to despise a man;\nand strangest of all, she seemed to like him.  Would his brother despise\nhim, too?  And would his brother like him?\n\nAnd presently the brother appeared, under Flora’s escort; and, standing\nafar off beside the doorway, eyed the hero of this tale.\n\n‘So this is you?’ he said, at length.\n\n‘Yes, Alick, it’s me—it’s John,’ replied the elder brother, feebly.\n\n‘And how did you get in here?’ inquired the younger.\n\n‘Oh, I had my pass-key,’ says John.\n\n‘The deuce you had!’ said Alexander.  ‘Ah, you lived in a better world!\nThere are no pass-keys going now.’\n\n‘Well, father was always averse to them,’ sighed John.  And the\nconversation then broke down, and the brothers looked askance at one\nanother in silence.\n\n‘Well, and what the devil are we to do?’ said Alexander.  ‘I suppose if\nthe authorities got wind of you, you would be taken up?’\n\n‘It depends on whether they’ve found the body or not,’ returned John.\n‘And then there’s that cabman, to be sure!’\n\n‘Oh, bother the body!’ said Alexander.  ‘I mean about the other thing.\nThat’s serious.’\n\n‘Is that what my father spoke about?’ asked John.  ‘I don’t even know\nwhat it is.’\n\n‘About your robbing your bank in California, of course,’ replied\nAlexander.\n\nIt was plain, from Flora’s face, that this was the first she had heard of\nit; it was plainer still, from John’s, that he was innocent.\n\n‘I!’ he exclaimed.  ‘I rob my bank!  My God!  Flora, this is too much;\neven you must allow that.’\n\n‘Meaning you didn’t?’ asked Alexander.\n\n‘I never robbed a soul in all my days,’ cried John: ‘except my father, if\nyou call that robbery; and I brought him back the money in this room, and\nhe wouldn’t even take it!’\n\n‘Look here, John,’ said his brother, ‘let us have no misunderstanding\nupon this.  Macewen saw my father; he told him a bank you had worked for\nin San Francisco was wiring over the habitable globe to have you\ncollared—that it was supposed you had nailed thousands; and it was dead\ncertain you had nailed three hundred.  So Macewen said, and I wish you\nwould be careful how you answer.  I may tell you also, that your father\npaid the three hundred on the spot.’\n\n‘Three hundred?’ repeated John.  ‘Three hundred pounds, you mean?  That’s\nfifteen hundred dollars.  Why, then, it’s Kirkman!’ he broke out.  ‘Thank\nHeaven!  I can explain all that.  I gave them to Kirkman to pay for me\nthe night before I left—fifteen hundred dollars, and a letter to the\nmanager.  What do they suppose I would steal fifteen hundred dollars for?\nI’m rich; I struck it rich in stocks.  It’s the silliest stuff I ever\nheard of.  All that’s needful is to cable to the manager: Kirkman has the\nfifteen hundred—find Kirkman.  He was a fellow-clerk of mine, and a hard\ncase; but to do him justice, I didn’t think he was as hard as this.’\n\n‘And what do you say to that, Alick?’ asked Flora.\n\n‘I say the cablegram shall go to-night!’ cried Alexander, with energy.\n‘Answer prepaid, too.  If this can be cleared away—and upon my word I do\nbelieve it can—we shall all be able to hold up our heads again.  Here,\nyou John, you stick down the address of your bank manager.  You, Flora,\nyou can pack John into my bed, for which I have no further use to-night.\nAs for me, I am off to the post-office, and thence to the High Street\nabout the dead body.  The police ought to know, you see, and they ought\nto know through John; and I can tell them some rigmarole about my brother\nbeing a man of highly nervous organisation, and the rest of it.  And\nthen, I’ll tell you what, John—did you notice the name upon the cab?’\n\nJohn gave the name of the driver, which, as I have not been able to\ncommand the vehicle, I here suppress.\n\n‘Well,’ resumed Alexander, ‘I’ll call round at their place before I come\nback, and pay your shot for you.  In that way, before breakfast-time,\nyou’ll be as good as new.’\n\nJohn murmured inarticulate thanks.  To see his brother thus energetic in\nhis service moved him beyond expression; if he could not utter what he\nfelt, he showed it legibly in his face; and Alexander read it there, and\nliked it the better in that dumb delivery.\n\n‘But there’s one thing,’ said the latter, ‘cablegrams are dear; and I\ndare say you remember enough of the governor to guess the state of my\nfinances.’\n\n‘The trouble is,’ said John, ‘that all my stamps are in that beastly\nhouse.’\n\n‘All your what?’ asked Alexander.\n\n‘Stamps—money,’ explained John.  ‘It’s an American expression; I’m afraid\nI contracted one or two.’\n\n‘I have some,’ said Flora.  ‘I have a pound note upstairs.’\n\n‘My dear Flora,’ returned Alexander, ‘a pound note won’t see us very far;\nand besides, this is my father’s business, and I shall be very much\nsurprised if it isn’t my father who pays for it.’\n\n‘I would not apply to him yet; I do not think that can be wise,’ objected\nFlora.\n\n‘You have a very imperfect idea of my resources, and not at all of my\neffrontery,’ replied Alexander.  ‘Please observe.’\n\nHe put John from his way, chose a stout knife among the supper things,\nand with surprising quickness broke into his father’s drawer.\n\n‘There’s nothing easier when you come to try,’ he observed, pocketing the\nmoney.\n\n‘I wish you had not done that,’ said Flora.  ‘You will never hear the\nlast of it.’\n\n‘Oh, I don’t know,’ returned the young man; ‘the governor is human after\nall.  And now, John, let me see your famous pass-key.  Get into bed, and\ndon’t move for any one till I come back.  They won’t mind you not\nanswering when they knock; I generally don’t myself.’\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—IN WHICH MR. NICHOLSON ACCEPTS THE PRINCIPLE OF AN ALLOWANCE\n\n\nIN spite of the horrors of the day and the tea-drinking of the night,\nJohn slept the sleep of infancy.  He was awakened by the maid, as it\nmight have been ten years ago, tapping at the door.  The winter sunrise\nwas painting the east; and as the window was to the back of the house, it\nshone into the room with many strange colours of refracted light.\nWithout, the houses were all cleanly roofed with snow; the garden walls\nwere coped with it a foot in height; the greens lay glittering.  Yet\nstrange as snow had grown to John during his years upon the Bay of San\nFrancisco, it was what he saw within that most affected him.  For it was\nto his own room that Alexander had been promoted; there was the old paper\nwith the device of flowers, in which a cunning fancy might yet detect the\nface of Skinny Jim, of the Academy, John’s former dominie; there was the\nold chest of drawers; there were the chairs—one, two, three—three as\nbefore.  Only the carpet was new, and the litter of Alexander’s clothes\nand books and drawing materials, and a pencil-drawing on the wall, which\n(in John’s eyes) appeared a marvel of proficiency.\n\nHe was thus lying, and looking, and dreaming, hanging, as it were,\nbetween two epochs of his life, when Alexander came to the door, and made\nhis presence known in a loud whisper.  John let him in, and jumped back\ninto the warm bed.\n\n‘Well, John,’ said Alexander, ‘the cablegram is sent in your name, and\ntwenty words of answer paid.  I have been to the cab office and paid your\ncab, even saw the old gentleman himself, and properly apologised.  He was\nmighty placable, and indicated his belief you had been drinking.  Then I\nknocked up old Macewen out of bed, and explained affairs to him as he sat\nand shivered in a dressing-gown.  And before that I had been to the High\nStreet, where they have heard nothing of your dead body, so that I\nincline to the idea that you dreamed it.’\n\n‘Catch me!’ said John.\n\n‘Well, the police never do know anything,’ assented Alexander; ‘and at\nany rate, they have despatched a man to inquire and to recover your\ntrousers and your money, so that really your bill is now fairly clean;\nand I see but one lion in your path—the governor.’\n\n‘I’ll be turned out again, you’ll see,’ said John, dismally.\n\n‘I don’t imagine so,’ returned the other; ‘not if you do what Flora and I\nhave arranged; and your business now is to dress, and lose no time about\nit.  Is your watch right?  Well, you have a quarter of an hour.  By five\nminutes before the half-hour you must be at table, in your old seat,\nunder Uncle Duthie’s picture.  Flora will be there to keep you\ncountenance; and we shall see what we shall see.’\n\n‘Wouldn’t it be wiser for me to stay in bed?’ said John.\n\n‘If you mean to manage your own concerns, you can do precisely what you\nlike,’ replied Alexander; ‘but if you are not in your place five minutes\nbefore the half-hour I wash my hands of you, for one.’\n\nAnd thereupon he departed.  He had spoken warmly, but the truth is, his\nheart was somewhat troubled.  And as he hung over the balusters, watching\nfor his father to appear, he had hard ado to keep himself braced for the\nencounter that must follow.\n\n‘If he takes it well, I shall be lucky,’ he reflected.\n\n‘If he takes it ill, why it’ll be a herring across John’s tracks, and\nperhaps all for the best.  He’s a confounded muff, this brother of mine,\nbut he seems a decent soul.’\n\nAt that stage a door opened below with a certain emphasis, and Mr.\nNicholson was seen solemnly to descend the stairs, and pass into his own\napartment.  Alexander followed, quaking inwardly, but with a steady face.\nHe knocked, was bidden to enter, and found his father standing in front\nof the forced drawer, to which he pointed as he spoke.\n\n‘This is a most extraordinary thing,’ said he; ‘I have been robbed!’\n\n‘I was afraid you would notice it,’ observed his son; ‘it made such a\nbeastly hash of the table.’\n\n‘You were afraid I would notice it?’ repeated Mr. Nicholson.  ‘And, pray,\nwhat may that mean?’\n\n‘That I was a thief, sir,’ returned Alexander.  ‘I took all the money in\ncase the servants should get hold of it; and here is the change, and a\nnote of my expenditure.  You were gone to bed, you see, and I did not\nfeel at liberty to knock you up; but I think when you have heard the\ncircumstances, you will do me justice.  The fact is, I have reason to\nbelieve there has been some dreadful error about my brother John; the\nsooner it can be cleared up the better for all parties; it was a piece of\nbusiness, sir—and so I took it, and decided, on my own responsibility, to\nsend a telegram to San Francisco.  Thanks to my quickness we may hear\nto-night.  There appears to be no doubt, sir, that John has been\nabominably used.’\n\n‘When did this take place?’ asked the father.\n\n‘Last night, sir, after you were asleep,’ was the reply.\n\n‘It’s most extraordinary,’ said Mr. Nicholson.  ‘Do you mean to say you\nhave been out all night?’\n\n‘All night, as you say, sir.  I have been to the telegraph and the police\noffice, and Mr. Macewen’s.  Oh, I had my hands full,’ said Alexander.\n\n‘Very irregular,’ said the father.  ‘You think of no one but yourself.’\n\n‘I do not see that I have much to gain in bringing back my elder\nbrother,’ returned Alexander, shrewdly.\n\nThe answer pleased the old man; he smiled.  ‘Well, well, I will go into\nthis after breakfast,’ said he.\n\n‘I’m sorry about the table,’ said the son.\n\n‘The table is a small matter; I think nothing of that,’ said the father.\n\n‘It’s another example,’ continued the son, ‘of the awkwardness of a man\nhaving no money of his own.  If I had a proper allowance, like other\nfellows of my age, this would have been quite unnecessary.’\n\n‘A proper allowance!’ repeated his father, in tones of blighting sarcasm,\nfor the expression was not new to him.  ‘I have never grudged you money\nfor any proper purpose.’\n\n‘No doubt, no doubt,’ said Alexander, ‘but then you see you aren’t always\non the spot to have the thing explained to you.  Last night, for\ninstance—’\n\n‘You could have wakened me last night,’ interrupted his father.\n\n‘Was it not some similar affair that first got John into a mess?’ asked\nthe son, skilfully evading the point.\n\nBut the father was not less adroit.  ‘And pray, sir, how did you come and\ngo out of the house?’ he asked.\n\n‘I forgot to lock the door, it seems,’ replied Alexander.\n\n‘I have had cause to complain of that too often,’ said Mr. Nicholson.\n‘But still I do not understand.  Did you keep the servants up?’\n\n‘I propose to go into all that at length after breakfast,’ returned\nAlexander.  ‘There is the half-hour going; we must not keep Miss\nMackenzie waiting.’\n\nAnd greatly daring, he opened the door.\n\nEven Alexander, who, it must have been perceived was on terms of\ncomparative freedom with his parent—even Alexander had never before dared\nto cut short an interview in this high-handed fashion.  But the truth is,\nthe very mass of his son’s delinquencies daunted the old gentleman.  He\nwas like the man with the cart of apples—this was beyond him!  That\nAlexander should have spoiled his table, taken his money, stayed out all\nnight, and then coolly acknowledged all, was something undreamed of in\nthe Nicholsonian philosophy, and transcended comment.  The return of the\nchange, which the old gentleman still carried in his hand, had been a\nfeature of imposing impudence; it had dealt him a staggering blow.  Then\nthere was the reference to John’s original flight—a subject which he\nalways kept resolutely curtained in his own mind; for he was a man who\nloved to have made no mistakes, and when he feared he might have made one\nkept the papers sealed.  In view of all these surprises and reminders,\nand of his son’s composed and masterful demeanour, there began to creep\non Mr. Nicholson a sickly misgiving.  He seemed beyond his depth; if he\ndid or said anything, he might come to regret it.  The young man,\nbesides, as he had pointed out himself, was playing a generous part.  And\nif wrong had been done—and done to one who was, after, and in spite of,\nall, a Nicholson—it should certainly be righted.\n\nAll things considered, monstrous as it was to be cut short in his\ninquiries, the old gentleman submitted, pocketed the change, and followed\nhis son into the dining-room.  During these few steps he once more\nmentally revolted, and once more, and this time finally, laid down his\narms: a still, small voice in his bosom having informed him authentically\nof a piece of news; that he was afraid of Alexander.  The strange thing\nwas that he was pleased to be afraid of him.  He was proud of his son; he\nmight be proud of him; the boy had character and grit, and knew what he\nwas doing.\n\nThese were his reflections as he turned the corner of the dining-room\ndoor.  Miss Mackenzie was in the place of honour, conjuring with a\ntea-pot and a cosy; and, behold! there was another person present, a\nlarge, portly, whiskered man of a very comfortable and respectable air,\nwho now rose from his seat and came forward, holding out his hand.\n\n‘Good-morning, father,’ said he.\n\nOf the contention of feeling that ran high in Mr. Nicholson’s starched\nbosom, no outward sign was visible; nor did he delay long to make a\nchoice of conduct.  Yet in that interval he had reviewed a great field of\npossibilities both past and future; whether it was possible he had not\nbeen perfectly wise in his treatment of John; whether it was possible\nthat John was innocent; whether, if he turned John out a second time, as\nhis outraged authority suggested, it was possible to avoid a scandal; and\nwhether, if he went to that extremity, it was possible that Alexander\nmight rebel.\n\n‘Hum!’ said Mr. Nicholson, and put his hand, limp and dead, into John’s.\n\nAnd then, in an embarrassed silence, all took their places; and even the\npaper—from which it was the old gentleman’s habit to suck mortification\ndaily, as he marked the decline of our institutions—even the paper lay\nfurled by his side.\n\nBut presently Flora came to the rescue.  She slid into the silence with a\ntechnicality, asking if John still took his old inordinate amount of\nsugar.  Thence it was but a step to the burning question of the day; and\nin tones a little shaken, she commented on the interval since she had\nlast made tea for the prodigal, and congratulated him on his return.  And\nthen addressing Mr. Nicholson, she congratulated him also in a manner\nthat defied his ill-humour; and from that launched into the tale of\nJohn’s misadventures, not without some suitable suppressions.\n\nGradually Alexander joined; between them, whether he would or no, they\nforced a word or two from John; and these fell so tremulously, and spoke\nso eloquently of a mind oppressed with dread, that Mr. Nicholson\nrelented.  At length even he contributed a question: and before the meal\nwas at an end all four were talking even freely.\n\nPrayers followed, with the servants gaping at this new-comer whom no one\nhad admitted; and after prayers there came that moment on the clock which\nwas the signal for Mr. Nicholson’s departure.\n\n‘John,’ said he, ‘of course you will stay here.  Be very careful not to\nexcite Maria, if Miss Mackenzie thinks it desirable that you should see\nher.  Alexander, I wish to speak with you alone.’  And then, when they\nwere both in the back room: ‘You need not come to the office to-day,’\nsaid he; ‘you can stay and amuse your brother, and I think it would be\nrespectful to call on Uncle Greig.  And by the bye’ (this spoken with a\ncertain—dare we say?—bashfulness), ‘I agree to concede the principle of\nan allowance; and I will consult with Doctor Durie, who is quite a man of\nthe world and has sons of his own, as to the amount.  And, my fine\nfellow, you may consider yourself in luck!’ he added, with a smile.\n\n‘Thank you,’ said Alexander.\n\nBefore noon a detective had restored to John his money, and brought news,\nsad enough in truth, but perhaps the least sad possible.  Alan had been\nfound in his own house in Regent Terrace, under care of the terrified\nbutler.  He was quite mad, and instead of going to prison, had gone to\nMorningside Asylum.  The murdered man, it appeared, was an evicted tenant\nwho had for nearly a year pursued his late landlord with threats and\ninsults; and beyond this, the cause and details of the tragedy were lost.\n\nWhen Mr. Nicholson returned from dinner they were able to put a despatch\ninto his hands: ‘John V. Nicholson, Randolph Crescent, Edinburgh.—Kirkham\nhas disappeared; police looking for him.  All understood.  Keep mind\nquite easy.—Austin.’  Having had this explained to him, the old gentleman\ntook down the cellar key and departed for two bottles of the 1820 port.\nUncle Greig dined there that day, and Cousin Robina, and, by an odd\nchance, Mr. Macewen; and the presence of these strangers relieved what\nmight have been otherwise a somewhat strained relation.  Ere they\ndeparted, the family was welded once more into a fair semblance of unity.\n\nIn the end of April John led Flora—or, as more descriptive, Flora led\nJohn—to the altar, if altar that may be called which was indeed the\ndrawing-room mantel-piece in Mr. Nicholson’s house, with the Reverend Dr.\nDurie posted on the hearthrug in the guise of Hymen’s priest.\n\nThe last I saw of them, on a recent visit to the north, was at a\ndinner-party in the house of my old friend Gellatly Macbride; and after\nwe had, in classic phrase, ‘rejoined the ladies,’ I had an opportunity to\noverhear Flora conversing with another married woman on the much\ncanvassed matter of a husband’s tobacco.\n\n‘Oh yes!’ said she; ‘I only allow Mr. Nicholson four cigars a day.  Three\nhe smokes at fixed times—after a meal, you know, my dear; and the fourth\nhe can take when he likes with any friend.’\n\n‘Bravo!’ thought I to myself; ‘this is the wife for my friend John!’\n\n\n\n\nTHE BODY-SNATCHER\n\n\nEVERY night in the year, four of us sat in the small parlour of the\nGeorge at Debenham—the undertaker, and the landlord, and Fettes, and\nmyself.  Sometimes there would be more; but blow high, blow low, come\nrain or snow or frost, we four would be each planted in his own\nparticular arm-chair.  Fettes was an old drunken Scotchman, a man of\neducation obviously, and a man of some property, since he lived in\nidleness.  He had come to Debenham years ago, while still young, and by a\nmere continuance of living had grown to be an adopted townsman.  His blue\ncamlet cloak was a local antiquity, like the church-spire.  His place in\nthe parlour at the George, his absence from church, his old, crapulous,\ndisreputable vices, were all things of course in Debenham.  He had some\nvague Radical opinions and some fleeting infidelities, which he would now\nand again set forth and emphasise with tottering slaps upon the table.\nHe drank rum—five glasses regularly every evening; and for the greater\nportion of his nightly visit to the George sat, with his glass in his\nright hand, in a state of melancholy alcoholic saturation.  We called him\nthe Doctor, for he was supposed to have some special knowledge of\nmedicine, and had been known, upon a pinch, to set a fracture or reduce a\ndislocation; but beyond these slight particulars, we had no knowledge of\nhis character and antecedents.\n\nOne dark winter night—it had struck nine some time before the landlord\njoined us—there was a sick man in the George, a great neighbouring\nproprietor suddenly struck down with apoplexy on his way to Parliament;\nand the great man’s still greater London doctor had been telegraphed to\nhis bedside.  It was the first time that such a thing had happened in\nDebenham, for the railway was but newly open, and we were all\nproportionately moved by the occurrence.\n\n‘He’s come,’ said the landlord, after he had filled and lighted his pipe.\n\n‘He?’ said I.  ‘Who?—not the doctor?’\n\n‘Himself,’ replied our host.\n\n‘What is his name?’\n\n‘Doctor Macfarlane,’ said the landlord.\n\nFettes was far through his third tumbler, stupidly fuddled, now nodding\nover, now staring mazily around him; but at the last word he seemed to\nawaken, and repeated the name ‘Macfarlane’ twice, quietly enough the\nfirst time, but with sudden emotion at the second.\n\n‘Yes,’ said the landlord, ‘that’s his name, Doctor Wolfe Macfarlane.’\n\nFettes became instantly sober; his eyes awoke, his voice became clear,\nloud, and steady, his language forcible and earnest.  We were all\nstartled by the transformation, as if a man had risen from the dead.\n\n‘I beg your pardon,’ he said, ‘I am afraid I have not been paying much\nattention to your talk.  Who is this Wolfe Macfarlane?’  And then, when\nhe had heard the landlord out, ‘It cannot be, it cannot be,’ he added;\n‘and yet I would like well to see him face to face.’\n\n‘Do you know him, Doctor?’ asked the undertaker, with a gasp.\n\n‘God forbid!’ was the reply.  ‘And yet the name is a strange one; it were\ntoo much to fancy two.  Tell me, landlord, is he old?’\n\n‘Well,’ said the host, ‘he’s not a young man, to be sure, and his hair is\nwhite; but he looks younger than you.’\n\n‘He is older, though; years older.  But,’ with a slap upon the table,\n‘it’s the rum you see in my face—rum and sin.  This man, perhaps, may\nhave an easy conscience and a good digestion.  Conscience!  Hear me\nspeak.  You would think I was some good, old, decent Christian, would you\nnot?  But no, not I; I never canted.  Voltaire might have canted if he’d\nstood in my shoes; but the brains’—with a rattling fillip on his bald\nhead—‘the brains were clear and active, and I saw and made no\ndeductions.’\n\n‘If you know this doctor,’ I ventured to remark, after a somewhat awful\npause, ‘I should gather that you do not share the landlord’s good\nopinion.’\n\nFettes paid no regard to me.\n\n‘Yes,’ he said, with sudden decision, ‘I must see him face to face.’\n\nThere was another pause, and then a door was closed rather sharply on the\nfirst floor, and a step was heard upon the stair.\n\n‘That’s the doctor,’ cried the landlord.  ‘Look sharp, and you can catch\nhim.’\n\nIt was but two steps from the small parlour to the door of the old George\nInn; the wide oak staircase landed almost in the street; there was room\nfor a Turkey rug and nothing more between the threshold and the last\nround of the descent; but this little space was every evening brilliantly\nlit up, not only by the light upon the stair and the great signal-lamp\nbelow the sign, but by the warm radiance of the bar-room window.  The\nGeorge thus brightly advertised itself to passers-by in the cold street.\nFettes walked steadily to the spot, and we, who were hanging behind,\nbeheld the two men meet, as one of them had phrased it, face to face.\nDr. Macfarlane was alert and vigorous.  His white hair set off his pale\nand placid, although energetic, countenance.  He was richly dressed in\nthe finest of broadcloth and the whitest of linen, with a great gold\nwatch-chain, and studs and spectacles of the same precious material.  He\nwore a broad-folded tie, white and speckled with lilac, and he carried on\nhis arm a comfortable driving-coat of fur.  There was no doubt but he\nbecame his years, breathing, as he did, of wealth and consideration; and\nit was a surprising contrast to see our parlour sot—bald, dirty, pimpled,\nand robed in his old camlet cloak—confront him at the bottom of the\nstairs.\n\n‘Macfarlane!’ he said somewhat loudly, more like a herald than a friend.\n\nThe great doctor pulled up short on the fourth step, as though the\nfamiliarity of the address surprised and somewhat shocked his dignity.\n\n‘Toddy Macfarlane!’ repeated Fettes.\n\nThe London man almost staggered.  He stared for the swiftest of seconds\nat the man before him, glanced behind him with a sort of scare, and then\nin a startled whisper, ‘Fettes!’ he said, ‘You!’\n\n‘Ay,’ said the other, ‘me!  Did you think I was dead too?  We are not so\neasy shut of our acquaintance.’\n\n‘Hush, hush!’ exclaimed the doctor.  ‘Hush, hush! this meeting is so\nunexpected—I can see you are unmanned.  I hardly knew you, I confess, at\nfirst; but I am overjoyed—overjoyed to have this opportunity.  For the\npresent it must be how-d’ye-do and good-bye in one, for my fly is\nwaiting, and I must not fail the train; but you shall—let me see—yes—you\nshall give me your address, and you can count on early news of me.  We\nmust do something for you, Fettes.  I fear you are out at elbows; but we\nmust see to that for auld lang syne, as once we sang at suppers.’\n\n‘Money!’ cried Fettes; ‘money from you!  The money that I had from you is\nlying where I cast it in the rain.’\n\nDr. Macfarlane had talked himself into some measure of superiority and\nconfidence, but the uncommon energy of this refusal cast him back into\nhis first confusion.\n\nA horrible, ugly look came and went across his almost venerable\ncountenance.  ‘My dear fellow,’ he said, ‘be it as you please; my last\nthought is to offend you.  I would intrude on none.  I will leave you my\naddress, however—’\n\n‘I do not wish it—I do not wish to know the roof that shelters you,’\ninterrupted the other.  ‘I heard your name; I feared it might be you; I\nwished to know if, after all, there were a God; I know now that there is\nnone.  Begone!’\n\nHe still stood in the middle of the rug, between the stair and doorway;\nand the great London physician, in order to escape, would be forced to\nstep to one side.  It was plain that he hesitated before the thought of\nthis humiliation.  White as he was, there was a dangerous glitter in his\nspectacles; but while he still paused uncertain, he became aware that the\ndriver of his fly was peering in from the street at this unusual scene\nand caught a glimpse at the same time of our little body from the\nparlour, huddled by the corner of the bar.  The presence of so many\nwitnesses decided him at once to flee.  He crouched together, brushing on\nthe wainscot, and made a dart like a serpent, striking for the door.  But\nhis tribulation was not yet entirely at an end, for even as he was\npassing Fettes clutched him by the arm and these words came in a whisper,\nand yet painfully distinct, ‘Have you seen it again?’\n\nThe great rich London doctor cried out aloud with a sharp, throttling\ncry; he dashed his questioner across the open space, and, with his hands\nover his head, fled out of the door like a detected thief.  Before it had\noccurred to one of us to make a movement the fly was already rattling\ntoward the station.  The scene was over like a dream, but the dream had\nleft proofs and traces of its passage.  Next day the servant found the\nfine gold spectacles broken on the threshold, and that very night we were\nall standing breathless by the bar-room window, and Fettes at our side,\nsober, pale, and resolute in look.\n\n‘God protect us, Mr. Fettes!’ said the landlord, coming first into\npossession of his customary senses.  ‘What in the universe is all this?\nThese are strange things you have been saying.’\n\nFettes turned toward us; he looked us each in succession in the face.\n‘See if you can hold your tongues,’ said he.  ‘That man Macfarlane is not\nsafe to cross; those that have done so already have repented it too\nlate.’\n\nAnd then, without so much as finishing his third glass, far less waiting\nfor the other two, he bade us good-bye and went forth, under the lamp of\nthe hotel, into the black night.\n\nWe three turned to our places in the parlour, with the big red fire and\nfour clear candles; and as we recapitulated what had passed, the first\nchill of our surprise soon changed into a glow of curiosity.  We sat\nlate; it was the latest session I have known in the old George.  Each\nman, before we parted, had his theory that he was bound to prove; and\nnone of us had any nearer business in this world than to track out the\npast of our condemned companion, and surprise the secret that he shared\nwith the great London doctor.  It is no great boast, but I believe I was\na better hand at worming out a story than either of my fellows at the\nGeorge; and perhaps there is now no other man alive who could narrate to\nyou the following foul and unnatural events.\n\nIn his young days Fettes studied medicine in the schools of Edinburgh.\nHe had talent of a kind, the talent that picks up swiftly what it hears\nand readily retails it for its own.  He worked little at home; but he was\ncivil, attentive, and intelligent in the presence of his masters.  They\nsoon picked him out as a lad who listened closely and remembered well;\nnay, strange as it seemed to me when I first heard it, he was in those\ndays well favoured, and pleased by his exterior.  There was, at that\nperiod, a certain extramural teacher of anatomy, whom I shall here\ndesignate by the letter K.  His name was subsequently too well known.\nThe man who bore it skulked through the streets of Edinburgh in disguise,\nwhile the mob that applauded at the execution of Burke called loudly for\nthe blood of his employer.  But Mr. K— was then at the top of his vogue;\nhe enjoyed a popularity due partly to his own talent and address, partly\nto the incapacity of his rival, the university professor.  The students,\nat least, swore by his name, and Fettes believed himself, and was\nbelieved by others, to have laid the foundations of success when he had\nacquired the favour of this meteorically famous man.  Mr. K— was a _bon\nvivant_ as well as an accomplished teacher; he liked a sly illusion no\nless than a careful preparation.  In both capacities Fettes enjoyed and\ndeserved his notice, and by the second year of his attendance he held the\nhalf-regular position of second demonstrator or sub-assistant in his\nclass.\n\nIn this capacity the charge of the theatre and lecture-room devolved in\nparticular upon his shoulders.  He had to answer for the cleanliness of\nthe premises and the conduct of the other students, and it was a part of\nhis duty to supply, receive, and divide the various subjects.  It was\nwith a view to this last—at that time very delicate—affair that he was\nlodged by Mr. K— in the same wynd, and at last in the same building, with\nthe dissecting-rooms.  Here, after a night of turbulent pleasures, his\nhand still tottering, his sight still misty and confused, he would be\ncalled out of bed in the black hours before the winter dawn by the\nunclean and desperate interlopers who supplied the table.  He would open\nthe door to these men, since infamous throughout the land.  He would help\nthem with their tragic burden, pay them their sordid price, and remain\nalone, when they were gone, with the unfriendly relics of humanity.  From\nsuch a scene he would return to snatch another hour or two of slumber, to\nrepair the abuses of the night, and refresh himself for the labours of\nthe day.\n\nFew lads could have been more insensible to the impressions of a life\nthus passed among the ensigns of mortality.  His mind was closed against\nall general considerations.  He was incapable of interest in the fate and\nfortunes of another, the slave of his own desires and low ambitions.\nCold, light, and selfish in the last resort, he had that modicum of\nprudence, miscalled morality, which keeps a man from inconvenient\ndrunkenness or punishable theft.  He coveted, besides, a measure of\nconsideration from his masters and his fellow-pupils, and he had no\ndesire to fail conspicuously in the external parts of life.  Thus he made\nit his pleasure to gain some distinction in his studies, and day after\nday rendered unimpeachable eye-service to his employer, Mr. K—.  For his\nday of work he indemnified himself by nights of roaring, blackguardly\nenjoyment; and when that balance had been struck, the organ that he\ncalled his conscience declared itself content.\n\nThe supply of subjects was a continual trouble to him as well as to his\nmaster.  In that large and busy class, the raw material of the anatomists\nkept perpetually running out; and the business thus rendered necessary\nwas not only unpleasant in itself, but threatened dangerous consequences\nto all who were concerned.  It was the policy of Mr. K— to ask no\nquestions in his dealings with the trade.  ‘They bring the body, and we\npay the price,’ he used to say, dwelling on the alliteration—‘_quid pro\nquo_.’  And, again, and somewhat profanely, ‘Ask no questions,’ he would\ntell his assistants, ‘for conscience’ sake.’  There was no understanding\nthat the subjects were provided by the crime of murder.  Had that idea\nbeen broached to him in words, he would have recoiled in horror; but the\nlightness of his speech upon so grave a matter was, in itself, an offence\nagainst good manners, and a temptation to the men with whom he dealt.\nFettes, for instance, had often remarked to himself upon the singular\nfreshness of the bodies.  He had been struck again and again by the\nhang-dog, abominable looks of the ruffians who came to him before the\ndawn; and putting things together clearly in his private thoughts, he\nperhaps attributed a meaning too immoral and too categorical to the\nunguarded counsels of his master.  He understood his duty, in short, to\nhave three branches: to take what was brought, to pay the price, and to\navert the eye from any evidence of crime.\n\nOne November morning this policy of silence was put sharply to the test.\nHe had been awake all night with a racking toothache—pacing his room like\na caged beast or throwing himself in fury on his bed—and had fallen at\nlast into that profound, uneasy slumber that so often follows on a night\nof pain, when he was awakened by the third or fourth angry repetition of\nthe concerted signal.  There was a thin, bright moonshine; it was bitter\ncold, windy, and frosty; the town had not yet awakened, but an\nindefinable stir already preluded the noise and business of the day.  The\nghouls had come later than usual, and they seemed more than usually eager\nto be gone.  Fettes, sick with sleep, lighted them upstairs.  He heard\ntheir grumbling Irish voices through a dream; and as they stripped the\nsack from their sad merchandise he leaned dozing, with his shoulder\npropped against the wall; he had to shake himself to find the men their\nmoney.  As he did so his eyes lighted on the dead face.  He started; he\ntook two steps nearer, with the candle raised.\n\n‘God Almighty!’ he cried.  ‘That is Jane Galbraith!’\n\nThe men answered nothing, but they shuffled nearer the door.\n\n‘I know her, I tell you,’ he continued.  ‘She was alive and hearty\nyesterday.  It’s impossible she can be dead; it’s impossible you should\nhave got this body fairly.’\n\n‘Sure, sir, you’re mistaken entirely,’ said one of the men.\n\nBut the other looked Fettes darkly in the eyes, and demanded the money on\nthe spot.\n\nIt was impossible to misconceive the threat or to exaggerate the danger.\nThe lad’s heart failed him.  He stammered some excuses, counted out the\nsum, and saw his hateful visitors depart.  No sooner were they gone than\nhe hastened to confirm his doubts.  By a dozen unquestionable marks he\nidentified the girl he had jested with the day before.  He saw, with\nhorror, marks upon her body that might well betoken violence.  A panic\nseized him, and he took refuge in his room.  There he reflected at length\nover the discovery that he had made; considered soberly the bearing of\nMr. K—’s instructions and the danger to himself of interference in so\nserious a business, and at last, in sore perplexity, determined to wait\nfor the advice of his immediate superior, the class assistant.\n\nThis was a young doctor, Wolfe Macfarlane, a high favourite among all the\nreckless students, clever, dissipated, and unscrupulous to the last\ndegree.  He had travelled and studied abroad.  His manners were agreeable\nand a little forward.  He was an authority on the stage, skilful on the\nice or the links with skate or golf-club; he dressed with nice audacity,\nand, to put the finishing touch upon his glory, he kept a gig and a\nstrong trotting-horse.  With Fettes he was on terms of intimacy; indeed,\ntheir relative positions called for some community of life; and when\nsubjects were scarce the pair would drive far into the country in\nMacfarlane’s gig, visit and desecrate some lonely graveyard, and return\nbefore dawn with their booty to the door of the dissecting-room.\n\nOn that particular morning Macfarlane arrived somewhat earlier than his\nwont.  Fettes heard him, and met him on the stairs, told him his story,\nand showed him the cause of his alarm.  Macfarlane examined the marks on\nher body.\n\n‘Yes,’ he said with a nod, ‘it looks fishy.’\n\n‘Well, what should I do?’ asked Fettes.\n\n‘Do?’ repeated the other.  ‘Do you want to do anything?  Least said\nsoonest mended, I should say.’\n\n‘Some one else might recognise her,’ objected Fettes.  ‘She was as well\nknown as the Castle Rock.’\n\n‘We’ll hope not,’ said Macfarlane, ‘and if anybody does—well, you didn’t,\ndon’t you see, and there’s an end.  The fact is, this has been going on\ntoo long.  Stir up the mud, and you’ll get K— into the most unholy\ntrouble; you’ll be in a shocking box yourself.  So will I, if you come to\nthat.  I should like to know how any one of us would look, or what the\ndevil we should have to say for ourselves, in any Christian witness-box.\nFor me, you know there’s one thing certain—that, practically speaking,\nall our subjects have been murdered.’\n\n‘Macfarlane!’ cried Fettes.\n\n‘Come now!’ sneered the other.  ‘As if you hadn’t suspected it yourself!’\n\n‘Suspecting is one thing—’\n\n‘And proof another.  Yes, I know; and I’m as sorry as you are this should\nhave come here,’ tapping the body with his cane.  ‘The next best thing\nfor me is not to recognise it; and,’ he added coolly, ‘I don’t.  You may,\nif you please.  I don’t dictate, but I think a man of the world would do\nas I do; and I may add, I fancy that is what K— would look for at our\nhands.  The question is, Why did he choose us two for his assistants?\nAnd I answer, because he didn’t want old wives.’\n\nThis was the tone of all others to affect the mind of a lad like Fettes.\nHe agreed to imitate Macfarlane.  The body of the unfortunate girl was\nduly dissected, and no one remarked or appeared to recognise her.\n\nOne afternoon, when his day’s work was over, Fettes dropped into a\npopular tavern and found Macfarlane sitting with a stranger.  This was a\nsmall man, very pale and dark, with coal-black eyes.  The cut of his\nfeatures gave a promise of intellect and refinement which was but feebly\nrealised in his manners, for he proved, upon a nearer acquaintance,\ncoarse, vulgar, and stupid.  He exercised, however, a very remarkable\ncontrol over Macfarlane; issued orders like the Great Bashaw; became\ninflamed at the least discussion or delay, and commented rudely on the\nservility with which he was obeyed.  This most offensive person took a\nfancy to Fettes on the spot, plied him with drinks, and honoured him with\nunusual confidences on his past career.  If a tenth part of what he\nconfessed were true, he was a very loathsome rogue; and the lad’s vanity\nwas tickled by the attention of so experienced a man.\n\n‘I’m a pretty bad fellow myself,’ the stranger remarked, ‘but Macfarlane\nis the boy—Toddy Macfarlane I call him.  Toddy, order your friend another\nglass.’  Or it might be, ‘Toddy, you jump up and shut the door.’  ‘Toddy\nhates me,’ he said again.  ‘Oh yes, Toddy, you do!’\n\n‘Don’t you call me that confounded name,’ growled Macfarlane.\n\n‘Hear him!  Did you ever see the lads play knife?  He would like to do\nthat all over my body,’ remarked the stranger.\n\n‘We medicals have a better way than that,’ said Fettes.  ‘When we dislike\na dead friend of ours, we dissect him.’\n\nMacfarlane looked up sharply, as though this jest were scarcely to his\nmind.\n\nThe afternoon passed.  Gray, for that was the stranger’s name, invited\nFettes to join them at dinner, ordered a feast so sumptuous that the\ntavern was thrown into commotion, and when all was done commanded\nMacfarlane to settle the bill.  It was late before they separated; the\nman Gray was incapably drunk.  Macfarlane, sobered by his fury, chewed\nthe cud of the money he had been forced to squander and the slights he\nhad been obliged to swallow.  Fettes, with various liquors singing in his\nhead, returned home with devious footsteps and a mind entirely in\nabeyance.  Next day Macfarlane was absent from the class, and Fettes\nsmiled to himself as he imagined him still squiring the intolerable Gray\nfrom tavern to tavern.  As soon as the hour of liberty had struck he\nposted from place to place in quest of his last night’s companions.  He\ncould find them, however, nowhere; so returned early to his rooms, went\nearly to bed, and slept the sleep of the just.\n\nAt four in the morning he was awakened by the well-known signal.\nDescending to the door, he was filled with astonishment to find\nMacfarlane with his gig, and in the gig one of those long and ghastly\npackages with which he was so well acquainted.\n\n‘What?’ he cried.  ‘Have you been out alone?  How did you manage?’\n\nBut Macfarlane silenced him roughly, bidding him turn to business.  When\nthey had got the body upstairs and laid it on the table, Macfarlane made\nat first as if he were going away.  Then he paused and seemed to\nhesitate; and then, ‘You had better look at the face,’ said he, in tones\nof some constraint.  ‘You had better,’ he repeated, as Fettes only stared\nat him in wonder.\n\n‘But where, and how, and when did you come by it?’ cried the other.\n\n‘Look at the face,’ was the only answer.\n\nFettes was staggered; strange doubts assailed him.  He looked from the\nyoung doctor to the body, and then back again.  At last, with a start, he\ndid as he was bidden.  He had almost expected the sight that met his\neyes, and yet the shock was cruel.  To see, fixed in the rigidity of\ndeath and naked on that coarse layer of sackcloth, the man whom he had\nleft well clad and full of meat and sin upon the threshold of a tavern,\nawoke, even in the thoughtless Fettes, some of the terrors of the\nconscience.  It was a _cras tibi_ which re-echoed in his soul, that two\nwhom he had known should have come to lie upon these icy tables.  Yet\nthese were only secondary thoughts.  His first concern regarded Wolfe.\nUnprepared for a challenge so momentous, he knew not how to look his\ncomrade in the face.  He durst not meet his eye, and he had neither words\nnor voice at his command.\n\nIt was Macfarlane himself who made the first advance.  He came up quietly\nbehind and laid his hand gently but firmly on the other’s shoulder.\n\n‘Richardson,’ said he, ‘may have the head.’\n\nNow Richardson was a student who had long been anxious for that portion\nof the human subject to dissect.  There was no answer, and the murderer\nresumed: ‘Talking of business, you must pay me; your accounts, you see,\nmust tally.’\n\nFettes found a voice, the ghost of his own: ‘Pay you!’ he cried.  ‘Pay\nyou for that?’\n\n‘Why, yes, of course you must.  By all means and on every possible\naccount, you must,’ returned the other.  ‘I dare not give it for nothing,\nyou dare not take it for nothing; it would compromise us both.  This is\nanother case like Jane Galbraith’s.  The more things are wrong the more\nwe must act as if all were right.  Where does old K— keep his money?’\n\n‘There,’ answered Fettes hoarsely, pointing to a cupboard in the corner.\n\n‘Give me the key, then,’ said the other, calmly, holding out his hand.\n\nThere was an instant’s hesitation, and the die was cast.  Macfarlane\ncould not suppress a nervous twitch, the infinitesimal mark of an immense\nrelief, as he felt the key between his fingers.  He opened the cupboard,\nbrought out pen and ink and a paper-book that stood in one compartment,\nand separated from the funds in a drawer a sum suitable to the occasion.\n\n‘Now, look here,’ he said, ‘there is the payment made—first proof of your\ngood faith: first step to your security.  You have now to clinch it by a\nsecond.  Enter the payment in your book, and then you for your part may\ndefy the devil.’\n\nThe next few seconds were for Fettes an agony of thought; but in\nbalancing his terrors it was the most immediate that triumphed.  Any\nfuture difficulty seemed almost welcome if he could avoid a present\nquarrel with Macfarlane.  He set down the candle which he had been\ncarrying all this time, and with a steady hand entered the date, the\nnature, and the amount of the transaction.\n\n‘And now,’ said Macfarlane, ‘it’s only fair that you should pocket the\nlucre.  I’ve had my share already.  By the bye, when a man of the world\nfalls into a bit of luck, has a few shillings extra in his pocket—I’m\nashamed to speak of it, but there’s a rule of conduct in the case.  No\ntreating, no purchase of expensive class-books, no squaring of old debts;\nborrow, don’t lend.’\n\n‘Macfarlane,’ began Fettes, still somewhat hoarsely, ‘I have put my neck\nin a halter to oblige you.’\n\n‘To oblige me?’ cried Wolfe.  ‘Oh, come!  You did, as near as I can see\nthe matter, what you downright had to do in self-defence.  Suppose I got\ninto trouble, where would you be?  This second little matter flows\nclearly from the first.  Mr. Gray is the continuation of Miss Galbraith.\nYou can’t begin and then stop.  If you begin, you must keep on beginning;\nthat’s the truth.  No rest for the wicked.’\n\nA horrible sense of blackness and the treachery of fate seized hold upon\nthe soul of the unhappy student.\n\n‘My God!’ he cried, ‘but what have I done? and when did I begin?  To be\nmade a class assistant—in the name of reason, where’s the harm in that?\nService wanted the position; Service might have got it.  Would _he_ have\nbeen where _I_ am now?’\n\n‘My dear fellow,’ said Macfarlane, ‘what a boy you are!  What harm _has_\ncome to you?  What harm _can_ come to you if you hold your tongue?  Why,\nman, do you know what this life is?  There are two squads of us—the lions\nand the lambs.  If you’re a lamb, you’ll come to lie upon these tables\nlike Gray or Jane Galbraith; if you’re a lion, you’ll live and drive a\nhorse like me, like K—, like all the world with any wit or courage.\nYou’re staggered at the first.  But look at K—!  My dear fellow, you’re\nclever, you have pluck.  I like you, and K— likes you.  You were born to\nlead the hunt; and I tell you, on my honour and my experience of life,\nthree days from now you’ll laugh at all these scarecrows like a High\nSchool boy at a farce.’\n\nAnd with that Macfarlane took his departure and drove off up the wynd in\nhis gig to get under cover before daylight.  Fettes was thus left alone\nwith his regrets.  He saw the miserable peril in which he stood involved.\nHe saw, with inexpressible dismay, that there was no limit to his\nweakness, and that, from concession to concession, he had fallen from the\narbiter of Macfarlane’s destiny to his paid and helpless accomplice.  He\nwould have given the world to have been a little braver at the time, but\nit did not occur to him that he might still be brave.  The secret of Jane\nGalbraith and the cursed entry in the day-book closed his mouth.\n\nHours passed; the class began to arrive; the members of the unhappy Gray\nwere dealt out to one and to another, and received without remark.\nRichardson was made happy with the head; and before the hour of freedom\nrang Fettes trembled with exultation to perceive how far they had already\ngone toward safety.\n\nFor two days he continued to watch, with increasing joy, the dreadful\nprocess of disguise.\n\nOn the third day Macfarlane made his appearance.  He had been ill, he\nsaid; but he made up for lost time by the energy with which he directed\nthe students.  To Richardson in particular he extended the most valuable\nassistance and advice, and that student, encouraged by the praise of the\ndemonstrator, burned high with ambitious hopes, and saw the medal already\nin his grasp.\n\nBefore the week was out Macfarlane’s prophecy had been fulfilled.  Fettes\nhad outlived his terrors and had forgotten his baseness.  He began to\nplume himself upon his courage, and had so arranged the story in his mind\nthat he could look back on these events with an unhealthy pride.  Of his\naccomplice he saw but little.  They met, of course, in the business of\nthe class; they received their orders together from Mr. K—.  At times\nthey had a word or two in private, and Macfarlane was from first to last\nparticularly kind and jovial.  But it was plain that he avoided any\nreference to their common secret; and even when Fettes whispered to him\nthat he had cast in his lot with the lions and foresworn the lambs, he\nonly signed to him smilingly to hold his peace.\n\nAt length an occasion arose which threw the pair once more into a closer\nunion.  Mr. K— was again short of subjects; pupils were eager, and it was\na part of this teacher’s pretensions to be always well supplied.  At the\nsame time there came the news of a burial in the rustic graveyard of\nGlencorse.  Time has little changed the place in question.  It stood\nthen, as now, upon a cross road, out of call of human habitations, and\nburied fathom deep in the foliage of six cedar trees.  The cries of the\nsheep upon the neighbouring hills, the streamlets upon either hand, one\nloudly singing among pebbles, the other dripping furtively from pond to\npond, the stir of the wind in mountainous old flowering chestnuts, and\nonce in seven days the voice of the bell and the old tunes of the\nprecentor, were the only sounds that disturbed the silence around the\nrural church.  The Resurrection Man—to use a byname of the period—was not\nto be deterred by any of the sanctities of customary piety.  It was part\nof his trade to despise and desecrate the scrolls and trumpets of old\ntombs, the paths worn by the feet of worshippers and mourners, and the\nofferings and the inscriptions of bereaved affection.  To rustic\nneighbourhoods, where love is more than commonly tenacious, and where\nsome bonds of blood or fellowship unite the entire society of a parish,\nthe body-snatcher, far from being repelled by natural respect, was\nattracted by the ease and safety of the task.  To bodies that had been\nlaid in earth, in joyful expectation of a far different awakening, there\ncame that hasty, lamp-lit, terror-haunted resurrection of the spade and\nmattock.  The coffin was forced, the cerements torn, and the melancholy\nrelics, clad in sackcloth, after being rattled for hours on moonless\nbyways, were at length exposed to uttermost indignities before a class of\ngaping boys.\n\nSomewhat as two vultures may swoop upon a dying lamb, Fettes and\nMacfarlane were to be let loose upon a grave in that green and quiet\nresting-place.  The wife of a farmer, a woman who had lived for sixty\nyears, and been known for nothing but good butter and a godly\nconversation, was to be rooted from her grave at midnight and carried,\ndead and naked, to that far-away city that she had always honoured with\nher Sunday’s best; the place beside her family was to be empty till the\ncrack of doom; her innocent and almost venerable members to be exposed to\nthat last curiosity of the anatomist.\n\nLate one afternoon the pair set forth, well wrapped in cloaks and\nfurnished with a formidable bottle.  It rained without remission—a cold,\ndense, lashing rain.  Now and again there blew a puff of wind, but these\nsheets of falling water kept it down.  Bottle and all, it was a sad and\nsilent drive as far as Penicuik, where they were to spend the evening.\nThey stopped once, to hide their implements in a thick bush not far from\nthe churchyard, and once again at the Fisher’s Tryst, to have a toast\nbefore the kitchen fire and vary their nips of whisky with a glass of\nale.  When they reached their journey’s end the gig was housed, the horse\nwas fed and comforted, and the two young doctors in a private room sat\ndown to the best dinner and the best wine the house afforded.  The\nlights, the fire, the beating rain upon the window, the cold, incongruous\nwork that lay before them, added zest to their enjoyment of the meal.\nWith every glass their cordiality increased.  Soon Macfarlane handed a\nlittle pile of gold to his companion.\n\n‘A compliment,’ he said.  ‘Between friends these little d-d\naccommodations ought to fly like pipe-lights.’\n\nFettes pocketed the money, and applauded the sentiment to the echo.  ‘You\nare a philosopher,’ he cried.  ‘I was an ass till I knew you.  You and K—\nbetween you, by the Lord Harry! but you’ll make a man of me.’\n\n‘Of course we shall,’ applauded Macfarlane.  ‘A man?  I tell you, it\nrequired a man to back me up the other morning.  There are some big,\nbrawling, forty-year-old cowards who would have turned sick at the look\nof the d-d thing; but not you—you kept your head.  I watched you.’\n\n‘Well, and why not?’ Fettes thus vaunted himself.  ‘It was no affair of\nmine.  There was nothing to gain on the one side but disturbance, and on\nthe other I could count on your gratitude, don’t you see?’  And he\nslapped his pocket till the gold pieces rang.\n\nMacfarlane somehow felt a certain touch of alarm at these unpleasant\nwords.  He may have regretted that he had taught his young companion so\nsuccessfully, but he had no time to interfere, for the other noisily\ncontinued in this boastful strain:—\n\n‘The great thing is not to be afraid.  Now, between you and me, I don’t\nwant to hang—that’s practical; but for all cant, Macfarlane, I was born\nwith a contempt.  Hell, God, Devil, right, wrong, sin, crime, and all the\nold gallery of curiosities—they may frighten boys, but men of the world,\nlike you and me, despise them.  Here’s to the memory of Gray!’\n\nIt was by this time growing somewhat late.  The gig, according to order,\nwas brought round to the door with both lamps brightly shining, and the\nyoung men had to pay their bill and take the road.  They announced that\nthey were bound for Peebles, and drove in that direction till they were\nclear of the last houses of the town; then, extinguishing the lamps,\nreturned upon their course, and followed a by-road toward Glencorse.\nThere was no sound but that of their own passage, and the incessant,\nstrident pouring of the rain.  It was pitch dark; here and there a white\ngate or a white stone in the wall guided them for a short space across\nthe night; but for the most part it was at a foot pace, and almost\ngroping, that they picked their way through that resonant blackness to\ntheir solemn and isolated destination.  In the sunken woods that traverse\nthe neighbourhood of the burying-ground the last glimmer failed them, and\nit became necessary to kindle a match and re-illumine one of the lanterns\nof the gig.  Thus, under the dripping trees, and environed by huge and\nmoving shadows, they reached the scene of their unhallowed labours.\n\nThey were both experienced in such affairs, and powerful with the spade;\nand they had scarce been twenty minutes at their task before they were\nrewarded by a dull rattle on the coffin lid.  At the same moment\nMacfarlane, having hurt his hand upon a stone, flung it carelessly above\nhis head.  The grave, in which they now stood almost to the shoulders,\nwas close to the edge of the plateau of the graveyard; and the gig lamp\nhad been propped, the better to illuminate their labours, against a tree,\nand on the immediate verge of the steep bank descending to the stream.\nChance had taken a sure aim with the stone.  Then came a clang of broken\nglass; night fell upon them; sounds alternately dull and ringing\nannounced the bounding of the lantern down the bank, and its occasional\ncollision with the trees.  A stone or two, which it had dislodged in its\ndescent, rattled behind it into the profundities of the glen; and then\nsilence, like night, resumed its sway; and they might bend their hearing\nto its utmost pitch, but naught was to be heard except the rain, now\nmarching to the wind, now steadily falling over miles of open country.\n\nThey were so nearly at an end of their abhorred task that they judged it\nwisest to complete it in the dark.  The coffin was exhumed and broken\nopen; the body inserted in the dripping sack and carried between them to\nthe gig; one mounted to keep it in its place, and the other, taking the\nhorse by the mouth, groped along by wall and bush until they reached the\nwider road by the Fisher’s Tryst.  Here was a faint, diffused radiancy,\nwhich they hailed like daylight; by that they pushed the horse to a good\npace and began to rattle along merrily in the direction of the town.\n\nThey had both been wetted to the skin during their operations, and now,\nas the gig jumped among the deep ruts, the thing that stood propped\nbetween them fell now upon one and now upon the other.  At every\nrepetition of the horrid contact each instinctively repelled it with the\ngreater haste; and the process, natural although it was, began to tell\nupon the nerves of the companions.  Macfarlane made some ill-favoured\njest about the farmer’s wife, but it came hollowly from his lips, and was\nallowed to drop in silence.  Still their unnatural burden bumped from\nside to side; and now the head would be laid, as if in confidence, upon\ntheir shoulders, and now the drenching sack-cloth would flap icily about\ntheir faces.  A creeping chill began to possess the soul of Fettes.  He\npeered at the bundle, and it seemed somehow larger than at first.  All\nover the country-side, and from every degree of distance, the farm dogs\naccompanied their passage with tragic ululations; and it grew and grew\nupon his mind that some unnatural miracle had been accomplished, that\nsome nameless change had befallen the dead body, and that it was in fear\nof their unholy burden that the dogs were howling.\n\n‘For God’s sake,’ said he, making a great effort to arrive at speech,\n‘for God’s sake, let’s have a light!’\n\nSeemingly Macfarlane was affected in the same direction; for, though he\nmade no reply, he stopped the horse, passed the reins to his companion,\ngot down, and proceeded to kindle the remaining lamp.  They had by that\ntime got no farther than the cross-road down to Auchenclinny.  The rain\nstill poured as though the deluge were returning, and it was no easy\nmatter to make a light in such a world of wet and darkness.  When at last\nthe flickering blue flame had been transferred to the wick and began to\nexpand and clarify, and shed a wide circle of misty brightness round the\ngig, it became possible for the two young men to see each other and the\nthing they had along with them.  The rain had moulded the rough sacking\nto the outlines of the body underneath; the head was distinct from the\ntrunk, the shoulders plainly modelled; something at once spectral and\nhuman riveted their eyes upon the ghastly comrade of their drive.\n\nFor some time Macfarlane stood motionless, holding up the lamp.  A\nnameless dread was swathed, like a wet sheet, about the body, and\ntightened the white skin upon the face of Fettes; a fear that was\nmeaningless, a horror of what could not be, kept mounting to his brain.\nAnother beat of the watch, and he had spoken.  But his comrade\nforestalled him.\n\n‘That is not a woman,’ said Macfarlane, in a hushed voice.\n\n‘It was a woman when we put her in,’ whispered Fettes.\n\n‘Hold that lamp,’ said the other.  ‘I must see her face.’\n\nAnd as Fettes took the lamp his companion untied the fastenings of the\nsack and drew down the cover from the head.  The light fell very clear\nupon the dark, well-moulded features and smooth-shaven cheeks of a too\nfamiliar countenance, often beheld in dreams of both of these young men.\nA wild yell rang up into the night; each leaped from his own side into\nthe roadway: the lamp fell, broke, and was extinguished; and the horse,\nterrified by this unusual commotion, bounded and went off toward\nEdinburgh at a gallop, bearing along with it, sole occupant of the gig,\nthe body of the dead and long-dissected Gray.\n\n\n\n\nTHE STORY OF A LIE\n\n\nCHAPTER I—INTRODUCES THE ADMIRAL\n\n\nWHEN Dick Naseby was in Paris he made some odd acquaintances; for he was\none of those who have ears to hear, and can use their eyes no less than\ntheir intelligence.  He made as many thoughts as Stuart Mill; but his\nphilosophy concerned flesh and blood, and was experimental as to its\nmethod.  He was a type-hunter among mankind.  He despised small game and\ninsignificant personalities, whether in the shape of dukes or bagmen,\nletting them go by like sea-weed; but show him a refined or powerful\nface, let him hear a plangent or a penetrating voice, fish for him with a\nliving look in some one’s eye, a passionate gesture, a meaning and\nambiguous smile, and his mind was instantaneously awakened.  ‘There was a\nman, there was a woman,’ he seemed to say, and he stood up to the task of\ncomprehension with the delight of an artist in his art.\n\nAnd indeed, rightly considered, this interest of his was an artistic\ninterest.  There is no science in the personal study of human nature.\nAll comprehension is creation; the woman I love is somewhat of my\nhandiwork; and the great lover, like the great painter, is he that can so\nembellish his subject as to make her more than human, whilst yet by a\ncunning art he has so based his apotheosis on the nature of the case that\nthe woman can go on being a true woman, and give her character free play,\nand show littleness, or cherish spite, or be greedy of common pleasures,\nand he continue to worship without a thought of incongruity.  To love a\ncharacter is only the heroic way of understanding it.  When we love, by\nsome noble method of our own or some nobility of mien or nature in the\nother, we apprehend the loved one by what is noblest in ourselves.  When\nwe are merely studying an eccentricity, the method of our study is but a\nseries of allowances.  To begin to understand is to begin to sympathise;\nfor comprehension comes only when we have stated another’s faults and\nvirtues in terms of our own.  Hence the proverbial toleration of artists\nfor their own evil creations.  Hence, too, it came about that Dick\nNaseby, a high-minded creature, and as scrupulous and brave a gentleman\nas you would want to meet, held in a sort of affection the various human\ncreeping things whom he had met and studied.\n\nOne of these was Mr. Peter Van Tromp, an English-speaking, two-legged\nanimal of the international genus, and by profession of general and more\nthan equivocal utility.  Years before he had been a painter of some\nstanding in a colony, and portraits signed ‘Van Tromp’ had celebrated the\ngreatness of colonial governors and judges.  In those days he had been\nmarried, and driven his wife and infant daughter in a pony trap.  What\nwere the steps of his declension?  No one exactly knew.  Here he was at\nleast, and had been any time these past ten years, a sort of dismal\nparasite upon the foreigner in Paris.\n\nIt would be hazardous to specify his exact industry.  Coarsely followed,\nit would have merited a name grown somewhat unfamiliar to our ears.\nFollowed as he followed it, with a skilful reticence, in a kind of social\nchiaroscuro, it was still possible for the polite to call him a\nprofessional painter.  His lair was in the Grand Hotel and the gaudiest\ncafés.  There he might be seen jotting off a sketch with an air of some\ninspiration; and he was always affable, and one of the easiest of men to\nfall in talk withal.  A conversation usually ripened into a peculiar sort\nof intimacy, and it was extraordinary how many little services Van Tromp\ncontrived to render in the course of six-and-thirty hours.  He occupied a\nposition between a friend and a courier, which made him worse than\nembarrassing to repay.  But those whom he obliged could always buy one of\nhis villainous little pictures, or, where the favours had been prolonged\nand more than usually delicate, might order and pay for a large canvas,\nwith perfect certainty that they would hear no more of the transaction.\n\nAmong resident artists he enjoyed celebrity of a non-professional sort.\nHe had spent more money—no less than three individual fortunes, it was\nwhispered—than any of his associates could ever hope to gain.  Apart from\nhis colonial career, he had been to Greece in a brigantine with four\nbrass carronades; he had travelled Europe in a chaise and four, drawing\nbridle at the palace-doors of German princes; queens of song and dance\nhad followed him like sheep and paid his tailor’s bills.  And to behold\nhim now, seeking small loans with plaintive condescension, sponging for\nbreakfast on an art-student of nineteen, a fallen Don Juan who had\nneglected to die at the propitious hour, had a colour of romance for\nyoung imaginations.  His name and his bright past, seen through the prism\nof whispered gossip, had gained him the nickname of _The Admiral_.\n\nDick found him one day at the receipt of custom, rapidly painting a pair\nof hens and a cock in a little water-colour sketching box, and now and\nthen glancing at the ceiling like a man who should seek inspiration from\nthe muse.  Dick thought it remarkable that a painter should choose to\nwork over an absinthe in a public café, and looked the man over.  The\naged rakishness of his appearance was set off by a youthful costume; he\nhad disreputable grey hair and a disreputable sore, red nose; but the\ncoat and the gesture, the outworks of the man, were still designed for\nshow.  Dick came up to his table and inquired if he might look at what\nthe gentleman was doing.  No one was so delighted as the Admiral.\n\n‘A bit of a thing,’ said he.  ‘I just dash them off like that.  I—I dash\nthem off,’ he added with a gesture.\n\n‘Quite so,’ said Dick, who was appalled by the feebleness of the\nproduction.\n\n‘Understand me,’ continued Van Tromp; ‘I am a man of the world.  And\nyet—once an artist always an artist.  All of a sudden a thought takes me\nin the street; I become its prey: it’s like a pretty woman; no use to\nstruggle; I must—dash it off.’\n\n‘I see,’ said Dick.\n\n‘Yes,’ pursued the painter; ‘it all comes easily, easily to me; it is not\nmy business; it’s a pleasure.  Life is my business—life—this great city,\nParis—Paris after dark—its lights, its gardens, its odd corners.  Aha!’\nhe cried, ‘to be young again!  The heart is young, but the heels are\nleaden.  A poor, mean business, to grow old!  Nothing remains but the\n_coup d’œil_, the contemplative man’s enjoyment, Mr. —,’ and he paused\nfor the name.\n\n‘Naseby,’ returned Dick.\n\nThe other treated him at once to an exciting beverage, and expatiated on\nthe pleasure of meeting a compatriot in a foreign land; to hear him, you\nwould have thought they had encountered in Central Africa.  Dick had\nnever found any one take a fancy to him so readily, nor show it in an\neasier or less offensive manner.  He seemed tickled with him as an\nelderly fellow about town might be tickled by a pleasant and witty lad;\nhe indicated that he was no precision, but in his wildest times had never\nbeen such a blade as he thought Dick.  Dick protested, but in vain.  This\nmanner of carrying an intimacy at the bayonet’s point was Van Tromp’s\nstock-in-trade.  With an older man he insinuated himself; with youth he\nimposed himself, and in the same breath imposed an ideal on his victim,\nwho saw that he must work up to it or lose the esteem of this old and\nvicious patron.  And what young man can bear to lose a character for\nvice?\n\nAt last, as it grew towards dinner-time, ‘Do you know Paris?’ asked Van\nTromp.\n\n‘Not so well as you, I am convinced,’ said Dick.\n\n‘And so am I,’ returned Van Tromp gaily.  ‘Paris!  My young friend—you\nwill allow me?—when you know Paris as I do, you will have seen Strange\nThings.  I say no more; all I say is, Strange Things.  We are men of the\nworld, you and I, and in Paris, in the heart of civilised existence.\nThis is an opportunity, Mr. Naseby.  Let us dine.  Let me show you where\nto dine.’\n\nDick consented.  On the way to dinner the Admiral showed him where to buy\ngloves, and made him buy them; where to buy cigars, and made him buy a\nvast store, some of which he obligingly accepted.  At the restaurant he\nshowed him what to order, with surprising consequences in the bill.  What\nhe made that night by his percentages it would be hard to estimate.  And\nall the while Dick smilingly consented, understanding well that he was\nbeing done, but taking his losses in the pursuit of character as a hunter\nsacrifices his dogs.  As for the Strange Things, the reader will be\nrelieved to hear that they were no stranger than might have been\nexpected, and he may find things quite as strange without the expense of\na Van Tromp for guide.  Yet he was a guide of no mean order, who made up\nfor the poverty of what he had to show by a copious, imaginative\ncommentary.\n\n‘And such,’ said he, with a hiccup, ‘such is Paris.’\n\n‘Pooh!’ said Dick, who was tired of the performance.\n\nThe Admiral hung an ear, and looked up sidelong with a glimmer of\nsuspicion.\n\n‘Good night,’ said Dick; ‘I’m tired.’\n\n‘So English!’ cried Van Tromp, clutching him by the hand.  ‘So English!\nSo _blasé_!  Such a charming companion!  Let me see you home.’\n\n‘Look here,’ returned Dick, ‘I have said good night, and now I’m going.\nYou’re an amusing old boy: I like you, in a sense; but here’s an end of\nit for to-night.  Not another cigar, not another grog, not another\npercentage out of me.’\n\n‘I beg your pardon!’ cried the Admiral with dignity.\n\n‘Tut, man!’ said Dick; ‘you’re not offended; you’re a man of the world, I\nthought.  I’ve been studying you, and it’s over.  Have I not paid for the\nlesson?  _Au revoir_.’\n\nVan Tromp laughed gaily, shook hands up to the elbows, hoped cordially\nthey would meet again and that often, but looked after Dick as he\ndeparted with a tremor of indignation.  After that they two not\nunfrequently fell in each other’s way, and Dick would often treat the old\nboy to breakfast on a moderate scale and in a restaurant of his own\nselection.  Often, too, he would lend Van Tromp the matter of a pound, in\nview of that gentleman’s contemplated departure for Australia; there\nwould be a scene of farewell almost touching in character, and a week or\na month later they would meet on the same boulevard without surprise or\nembarrassment.  And in the meantime Dick learned more about his\nacquaintance on all sides: heard of his yacht, his chaise and four, his\nbrief season of celebrity amid a more confiding population, his daughter,\nof whom he loved to whimper in his cups, his sponging, parasitical,\nnameless way of life; and with each new detail something that was not\nmerely interest nor yet altogether affection grew up in his mind towards\nthis disreputable stepson of the arts.  Ere he left Paris Van Tromp was\none of those whom he entertained to a farewell supper; and the old\ngentleman made the speech of the evening, and then fell below the table,\nweeping, smiling, paralysed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—A LETTER TO THE PAPERS\n\n\nOLD Mr. Naseby had the sturdy, untutored nature of the upper middle\nclass.  The universe seemed plain to him.  ‘The thing’s right,’ he would\nsay, or ‘the thing’s wrong’; and there was an end of it.  There was a\ncontained, prophetic energy in his utterances, even on the slightest\naffairs; he _saw_ the damned thing; if you did not, it must be from\nperversity of will; and this sent the blood to his head.  Apart from\nthis, which made him an exacting companion, he was one of the most\nupright, hot-tempered, hot-headed old gentlemen in England.  Florid, with\nwhite hair, the face of an old Jupiter, and the figure of an old\nfox-hunter, he enlivened the vale of Thyme from end to end on his big,\ncantering chestnut.\n\nHe had a hearty respect for Dick as a lad of parts.  Dick had a respect\nfor his father as the best of men, tempered by the politic revolt of a\nyouth who has to see to his own independence.  Whenever the pair argued,\nthey came to an open rupture; and arguments were frequent, for they were\nboth positive, and both loved the work of the intelligence.  It was a\ntreat to hear Mr. Naseby defending the Church of England in a volley of\noaths, or supporting ascetic morals with an enthusiasm not entirely\ninnocent of port wine.  Dick used to wax indignant, and none the less so\nbecause, as his father was a skilful disputant, he found himself not\nseldom in the wrong.  On these occasions, he would redouble in energy,\nand declare that black was white, and blue yellow, with much conviction\nand heat of manner; but in the morning such a licence of debate weighed\nupon him like a crime, and he would seek out his father, where he walked\nbefore breakfast on a terrace overlooking all the vale of Thyme.\n\n‘I have to apologise, sir, for last night—’ he would begin.\n\n‘Of course you have,’ the old gentleman would cut in cheerfully.  ‘You\nspoke like a fool.  Say no more about it.’\n\n‘You do not understand me, sir.  I refer to a particular point.  I\nconfess there is much force in your argument from the doctrine of\npossibilities.’\n\n‘Of course there is,’ returned his father.  ‘Come down and look at the\nstables.  Only,’ he would add, ‘bear this in mind, and do remember that a\nman of my age and experience knows more about what he is saying than a\nraw boy.’\n\nHe would utter the word ‘boy’ even more offensively than the average of\nfathers, and the light way in which he accepted these apologies cut\nRichard to the heart.  The latter drew slighting comparisons, and\nremembered that he was the only one who ever apologised.  This gave him a\nhigh station in his own esteem, and thus contributed indirectly to his\nbetter behaviour; for he was scrupulous as well as high-spirited, and\nprided himself on nothing more than on a just submission.\n\nSo things went on until the famous occasion when Mr. Naseby, becoming\nengrossed in securing the election of a sound party candidate to\nParliament, wrote a flaming letter to the papers.  The letter had about\nevery demerit of party letters in general; it was expressed with the\nenergy of a believer; it was personal; it was a little more than half\nunfair, and about a quarter untrue.  The old man did not mean to say what\nwas untrue, you may be sure; but he had rashly picked up gossip, as his\nprejudice suggested, and now rashly launched it on the public with the\nsanction of his name.\n\n‘The Liberal candidate,’ he concluded, ‘is thus a public turncoat.  Is\nthat the sort of man we want?  He has been given the lie, and has\nswallowed the insult.  Is that the sort of man we want?  I answer No!\nWith all the force of my conviction, I answer, _No_!’\n\nAnd then he signed and dated the letter with an amateur’s pride, and\nlooked to be famous by the morrow.\n\nDick, who had heard nothing of the matter, was up first on that\ninauspicious day, and took the journal to an arbour in the garden.  He\nfound his father’s manifesto in one column; and in another a leading\narticle.  ‘No one that we are aware of,’ ran the article, ‘had consulted\nMr. Naseby on the subject, but if he had been appealed to by the whole\nbody of electors, his letter would be none the less ungenerous and unjust\nto Mr. Dalton.  We do not choose to give the lie to Mr. Naseby, for we\nare too well aware of the consequences; but we shall venture instead to\nprint the facts of both cases referred to by this red-hot partisan in\nanother portion of our issue.  Mr. Naseby is of course a large proprietor\nin our neighbourhood; but fidelity to facts, decent feeling, and English\ngrammar, are all of them qualities more important than the possession of\nland.  Mr. — is doubtless a great man; in his large gardens and that\nhalf-mile of greenhouses, where he has probably ripened his intellect and\ntemper, he may say what he will to his hired vassals, but (as the Scotch\nsay)—\n\n                               here\n    He mauna think to domineer.\n\n‘Liberalism,’ continued the anonymous journalist, ‘is of too free and\nsound a growth,’ etc.\n\nRichard Naseby read the whole thing from beginning to end; and a crushing\nshame fell upon his spirit.  His father had played the fool; he had gone\nout noisily to war, and come back with confusion.  The moment that his\ntrumpets sounded, he had been disgracefully unhorsed.  There was no\nquestion as to the facts; they were one and all against the Squire.\nRichard would have given his ears to have suppressed the issue; but as\nthat could not be done, he had his horse saddled, and furnishing himself\nwith a convenient staff, rode off at once to Thymebury.\n\nThe editor was at breakfast in a large, sad apartment.  The absence of\nfurniture, the extreme meanness of the meal, and the haggard,\nbright-eyed, consumptive look of the culprit, unmanned our hero; but he\nclung to his stick, and was stout and warlike.\n\n‘You wrote the article in this morning’s paper?’ he demanded.\n\n‘You are young Mr. Naseby?  I _published_ it,’ replied the editor,\nrising.\n\n‘My father is an old man,’ said Richard; and then with an outburst, ‘And\na damned sight finer fellow than either you or Dalton!’  He stopped and\nswallowed; he was determined that all should go with regularity.  ‘I have\nbut one question to put to you, sir,’ he resumed.  ‘Granted that my\nfather was misinformed, would it not have been more decent to withhold\nthe letter and communicate with him in private?’\n\n‘Believe me,’ returned the editor, ‘that alternative was not open to me.\nMr. Naseby told me in a note that he had sent his letter to three other\njournals, and in fact threatened me with what he called exposure if I\nkept it back from mine.  I am really concerned at what has happened; I\nsympathise and approve of your emotion, young gentleman; but the attack\non Mr. Dalton was gross, very gross, and I had no choice but to offer him\nmy columns to reply.  Party has its duties, sir,’ added the scribe,\nkindling, as one who should propose a sentiment; ‘and the attack was\ngross.’\n\nRichard stood for half a minute digesting the answer; and then the god of\nfair play came upper-most in his heart, and murmuring ‘Good morning,’ he\nmade his escape into the street.\n\nHis horse was not hurried on the way home, and he was late for breakfast.\nThe Squire was standing with his back to the fire in a state bordering on\napoplexy, his fingers violently knitted under his coat tails.  As Richard\ncame in, he opened and shut his mouth like a cod-fish, and his eyes\nprotruded.\n\n‘Have you seen that, sir?’ he cried, nodding towards the paper.\n\n‘Yes, sir,’ said Richard.\n\n‘Oh, you’ve read it, have you?’\n\n‘Yes, I have read it,’ replied Richard, looking at his foot.\n\n‘Well,’ demanded the old gentleman, ‘and what have you to say to it,\nsir?’\n\n‘You seem to have been misinformed,’ said Dick.\n\n‘Well?  What then?  Is your mind so sterile, sir?  Have you not a word of\ncomment? no proposal?’\n\n‘I fear, sir, you must apologise to Mr. Dalton.  It would be more\nhandsome, indeed it would be only just, and a free acknowledgment would\ngo far—’  Richard paused, no language appearing delicate enough to suit\nthe case.\n\n‘That is a suggestion which should have come from me, sir,’ roared the\nfather.  ‘It is out of place upon your lips.  It is not the thought of a\nloyal son.  Why, sir, if my father had been plunged in such deplorable\ncircumstances, I should have thrashed the editor of that vile sheet\nwithin an inch of his life.  I should have thrashed the man, sir.  It\nwould have been the action of an ass; but it would have shown that I had\nthe blood and the natural affections of a man.  Son?  You are no son, no\nson of mine, sir!’\n\n‘Sir!’ said Dick.\n\n‘I’ll tell you what you are, sir,’ pursued the Squire.  ‘You’re a\nBenthamite.  I disown you.  Your mother would have died for shame; there\nwas no modern cant about your mother; she thought—she said to me, sir—I’m\nglad she’s in her grave, Dick Naseby.  Misinformed!  Misinformed, sir?\nHave you no loyalty, no spring, no natural affections?  Are you\nclockwork, hey?  Away!  This is no place for you.  Away!’ (waving his\nhands in the air).  ‘Go away!  Leave me!’\n\nAt this moment Dick beat a retreat in a disarray of nerves, a whistling\nand clamour of his own arteries, and in short in such a final bodily\ndisorder as made him alike incapable of speech or hearing.  And in the\nmidst of all this turmoil, a sense of unpardonable injustice remained\ngraven in his memory.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—IN THE ADMIRAL’S NAME\n\n\nTHERE was no return to the subject.  Dick and his father were henceforth\non terms of coldness.  The upright old gentleman grew more upright when\nhe met his son, buckrammed with immortal anger; he asked after Dick’s\nhealth, and discussed the weather and the crops with an appalling\ncourtesy; his pronunciation was _point-de-vice_, his voice was distant,\ndistinct, and sometimes almost trembling with suppressed indignation.\n\nAs for Dick, it seemed to him as if his life had come abruptly to an end.\nHe came out of his theories and clevernesses; his premature\nman-of-the-worldness, on which he had prided himself on his travels,\n‘shrank like a thing ashamed’ before this real sorrow.  Pride, wounded\nhonour, pity and respect tussled together daily in his heart; and now he\nwas within an ace of throwing himself upon his father’s mercy, and now of\nslipping forth at night and coming back no more to Naseby House.  He\nsuffered from the sight of his father, nay, even from the neighbourhood\nof this familiar valley, where every corner had its legend, and he was\nbesieged with memories of childhood.  If he fled into a new land, and\namong none but strangers, he might escape his destiny, who knew? and\nbegin again light-heartedly.  From that chief peak of the hills, that now\nand then, like an uplifted finger, shone in an arrow of sunlight through\nthe broken clouds, the shepherd in clear weather might perceive the\nshining of the sea.  There, he thought, was hope.  But his heart failed\nhim when he saw the Squire; and he remained.  His fate was not that of\nthe voyager by sea and land; he was to travel in the spirit, and begin\nhis journey sooner than he supposed.\n\nFor it chanced one day that his walk led him into a portion of the\nuplands which was almost unknown to him.  Scrambling through some rough\nwoods, he came out upon a moorland reaching towards the hills.  A few\nlofty Scotch firs grew hard by upon a knoll; a clear fountain near the\nfoot of the knoll sent up a miniature streamlet which meandered in the\nheather.  A shower had just skimmed by, but now the sun shone brightly,\nand the air smelt of the pines and the grass.  On a stone under the trees\nsat a young lady sketching.  We have learned to think of women in a sort\nof symbolic transfiguration, based on clothes; and one of the readiest\nways in which we conceive our mistress is as a composite thing,\nprincipally petticoats.  But humanity has triumphed over clothes; the\nlook, the touch of a dress has become alive; and the woman who stitched\nherself into these material integuments has now permeated right through\nand gone out to the tip of her skirt.  It was only a black dress that\ncaught Dick Naseby’s eye; but it took possession of his mind, and all\nother thoughts departed.  He drew near, and the girl turned round.  Her\nface startled him; it was a face he wanted; and he took it in at once\nlike breathing air.\n\n‘I beg your pardon,’ he said, taking off his hat, ‘you are sketching.’\n\n‘Oh!’ she exclaimed, ‘for my own amusement.  I despise the thing.’\n\n‘Ten to one, you do yourself injustice,’ returned Dick.  ‘Besides, it’s a\nfreemasonry.  I sketch myself, and you know what that implies.’\n\n‘No.  What?’ she asked.\n\n‘Two things,’ he answered.  ‘First, that I am no very difficult critic;\nand second, that I have a right to see your picture.’\n\nShe covered the block with both her hands.  ‘Oh no,’ she said; ‘I am\nashamed.’\n\n‘Indeed, I might give you a hint,’ said Dick.  ‘Although no artist\nmyself, I have known many; in Paris I had many for friends, and used to\nprowl among studios.’\n\n‘In Paris?’ she cried, with a leap of light into her eyes.  ‘Did you ever\nmeet Mr. Van Tromp?’\n\n‘I?  Yes.  Why, you’re not the Admiral’s daughter, are you?’\n\n‘The Admiral?  Do they call him that?’ she cried.  ‘Oh, how nice, how\nnice of them!  It is the younger men who call him so, is it not?’\n\n‘Yes,’ said Dick, somewhat heavily.\n\n‘You can understand now,’ she said, with an unspeakable accent of\ncontented noble-minded pride, ‘why it is I do not choose to show my\nsketch.  Van Tromp’s daughter!  The Admiral’s daughter!  I delight in\nthat name.  The Admiral!  And so you know my father?’\n\n‘Well,’ said Dick, ‘I met him often; we were even intimate.  He may have\nmentioned my name—Naseby.’\n\n‘He writes so little.  He is so busy, so devoted to his art!  I have had\na half wish,’ she added laughing, ‘that my father was a plainer man, whom\nI could help—to whom I could be a credit; but only sometimes, you know,\nand with only half my heart.  For a great painter!  You have seen his\nworks?’\n\n‘I have seen some of them,’ returned Dick; ‘they—they are very nice.’\n\nShe laughed aloud.  ‘Nice?’ she repeated.  ‘I see you don’t care much for\nart.’\n\n‘Not much,’ he admitted; ‘but I know that many people are glad to buy Mr.\nVan Tromp’s pictures.’\n\n‘Call him the Admiral!’ she cried.  ‘It sounds kindly and familiar; and I\nlike to think that he is appreciated and looked up to by young painters.\nHe has not always been appreciated; he had a cruel life for many years;\nand when I think’—there were tears in her eyes—‘when I think of that, I\nfeel incline to be a fool,’ she broke off.  ‘And now I shall go home.\nYou have filled me full of happiness; for think, Mr. Naseby, I have not\nseen my father since I was six years old; and yet he is in my thoughts\nall day!  You must come and call on me; my aunt will be delighted, I am\nsure; and then you will tell me all—all about my father, will you not?’\n\nDick helped her to get her sketching traps together; and when all was\nready, she gave Dick her hand and a frank return of pressure.\n\n‘You are my father’s friend,’ she said; ‘we shall be great friends too.\nYou must come and see me soon.’\n\nThen she was gone down the hillside at a run; and Dick stood by himself\nin a state of some bewilderment and even distress.  There were elements\nof laughter in the business; but the black dress, and the face that\nbelonged to it, and the hand that he had held in his, inclined him to a\nserious view.  What was he, under the circumstances, called upon to do?\nPerhaps to avoid the girl?  Well, he would think about that.  Perhaps to\nbreak the truth to her?  Why, ten to one, such was her infatuation, he\nwould fail.  Perhaps to keep up the illusion, to colour the raw facts; to\nhelp her to false ideas, while yet not plainly stating falsehoods?  Well,\nhe would see about that; he would also see about avoiding the girl.  He\nsaw about this last so well, that the next afternoon beheld him on his\nway to visit her.\n\nIn the meantime the girl had gone straight home, light as a bird,\ntremulous with joy, to the little cottage where she lived alone with a\nmaiden aunt; and to that lady, a grim, sixty years old Scotchwoman, with\na nodding head, communicated news of her encounter and invitation.\n\n‘A friend of his?’ cried the aunt.  ‘What like is he?  What did ye say\nwas his name?’\n\nShe was dead silent, and stared at the old woman darkling.  Then very\nslowly, ‘I said he was my father’s friend; I have invited him to my\nhouse, and come he shall,’ she said; and with that she walked off to her\nroom, where she sat staring at the wall all the evening.  Miss M‘Glashan,\nfor that was the aunt’s name, read a large bible in the kitchen with some\nof the joys of martyrdom.\n\nIt was perhaps half-past three when Dick presented himself, rather\nscrupulously dressed, before the cottage door; he knocked, and a voice\nbade him enter.  The kitchen, which opened directly off the garden, was\nsomewhat darkened by foliage; but he could see her as she approached from\nthe far end to meet him.  This second sight of her surprised him.  Her\nstrong black brows spoke of temper easily aroused and hard to quiet; her\nmouth was small, nervous and weak; there was something dangerous and\nsulky underlying, in her nature, much that was honest, compassionate, and\neven noble.\n\n‘My father’s name,’ she said, ‘has made you very welcome.’\n\nAnd she gave him her hand, with a sort of curtsy.  It was a pretty\ngreeting, although somewhat mannered; and Dick felt himself among the\ngods.  She led him through the kitchen to a parlour, and presented him to\nMiss M‘Glashan.\n\n‘Esther,’ said the aunt, ‘see and make Mr. Naseby his tea.’\n\nAnd as soon as the girl was gone upon this hospitable intent, the old\nwoman crossed the room and came quite near to Dick as if in menace.\n\n‘Ye know that man?’ she asked in an imperious whisper.\n\n‘Mr. Van Tromp?’ said Dick.  ‘Yes, I know him.’\n\n‘Well, and what brings ye here?’ she said.  ‘I couldn’t save the\nmother—her that’s dead—but the bairn!’  She had a note in her voice that\nfilled poor Dick with consternation.  ‘Man,’ she went on, ‘what is it\nnow?  Is it money?’\n\n‘My dear lady,’ said Dick, ‘I think you misinterpret my position.  I am\nyoung Mr. Naseby of Naseby House.  My acquaintance with Mr. Van Tromp is\nreally very slender; I am only afraid that Miss Van Tromp has exaggerated\nour intimacy in her own imagination.  I know positively nothing of his\nprivate affairs, and do not care to know.  I met him casually in\nParis—that is all.’\n\nMiss M‘Glashan drew along breath.  ‘In Paris?’ she said.  ‘Well, and what\ndo you think of him?—what do ye think of him?’ she repeated, with a\ndifferent scansion, as Richard, who had not much taste for such a\nquestion, kept her waiting for an answer.\n\n‘I found him a very agreeable companion,’ he said.\n\n‘Ay,’ said she, ‘did ye!  And how does he win his bread?’\n\n‘I fancy,’ he gasped, ‘that Mr. Van Tromp has many generous friends.’\n\n‘I’ll warrant!’ she sneered; and before Dick could find more to say, she\nwas gone from the room.\n\nEsther returned with the tea-things, and sat down.\n\n‘Now,’ she said cosily, ‘tell me all about my father.’\n\n‘He’—stammered Dick, ‘he is a very agreeable companion.’\n\n‘I shall begin to think it is more than you are, Mr. Naseby,’ she said,\nwith a laugh.  ‘I am his daughter, you forget.  Begin at the beginning,\nand tell me all you have seen of him, all he said and all you answered.\nYou must have met somewhere; begin with that.’\n\nSo with that he began: how he had found the Admiral painting in a café;\nhow his art so possessed him that he could not wait till he got home\nto—well, to dash off his idea; how (this in reply to a question) his idea\nconsisted of a cock crowing and two hens eating corn; how he was fond of\ncocks and hens; how this did not lead him to neglect more ambitious forms\nof art; how he had a picture in his studio of a Greek subject which was\nsaid to be remarkable from several points of view; how no one had seen it\nnor knew the precise site of the studio in which it was being vigorously\nthough secretly confected; how (in answer to a suggestion) this shyness\nwas common to the Admiral, Michelangelo, and others; how they (Dick and\nVan Tromp) had struck up an acquaintance at once, and dined together that\nsame night; how he (the Admiral) had once given money to a beggar; how he\nspoke with effusion of his little daughter; how he had once borrowed\nmoney to send her a doll—a trait worthy of Newton, she being then in her\nnineteenth year at least; how, if the doll never arrived (which it\nappeared it never did), the trait was only more characteristic of the\nhighest order of creative intellect; how he was—no, not\nbeautiful—striking, yes, Dick would go so far, decidedly striking in\nappearance; how his boots were made to lace and his coat was black, not\ncut-away, a frock; and so on, and so on by the yard.  It was astonishing\nhow few lies were necessary.  After all, people exaggerated the\ndifficulty of life.  A little steering, just a touch of the rudder now\nand then, and with a willing listener there is no limit to the domain of\nequivocal speech.  Sometimes Miss M‘Glashan made a freezing sojourn in\nthe parlour; and then the task seemed unaccountably more difficult; but\nto Esther, who was all eyes and ears, her face alight with interest, his\nstream of language flowed without break or stumble, and his mind was ever\nfertile in ingenious evasions and—\n\nWhat an afternoon it was for Esther!\n\n‘Ah!’ she said at last, ‘it’s good to hear all this!  My aunt, you should\nknow, is narrow and too religious; she cannot understand an artist’s\nlife.  It does not frighten me,’ she added grandly; ‘I am an artist’s\ndaughter.’\n\nWith that speech, Dick consoled himself for his imposture; she was not\ndeceived so grossly after all; and then if a fraud, was not the fraud\npiety itself?—and what could be more obligatory than to keep alive in the\nheart of a daughter that filial trust and honour which, even although\nmisplaced, became her like a jewel of the mind?  There might be another\nthought, a shade of cowardice, a selfish desire to please; poor Dick was\nmerely human; and what would you have had him do?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—ESTHER ON THE FILIAL RELATION\n\n\nA MONTH later Dick and Esther met at the stile beside the cross roads;\nhad there been any one to see them but the birds and summer insects, it\nwould have been remarked that they met after a different fashion from the\nday before.  Dick took her in his arms, and their lips were set together\nfor a long while.  Then he held her at arm’s-length, and they looked\nstraight into each other’s eyes.\n\n‘Esther!’ he said; you should have heard his voice!\n\n‘Dick!’ said she.\n\n‘My darling!’\n\nIt was some time before they started for their walk; he kept an arm about\nher, and their sides were close together as they walked; the sun, the\nbirds, the west wind running among the trees, a pressure, a look, the\ngrasp tightening round a single finger, these things stood them in lieu\nof thought and filled their hearts with joy.  The path they were\nfollowing led them through a wood of pine-trees carpeted with heather and\nblue-berry, and upon this pleasant carpet, Dick, not without some\nseriousness, made her sit down.\n\n‘Esther!’ he began, ‘there is something you ought to know.  You know my\nfather is a rich man, and you would think, now that we love each other,\nwe might marry when we pleased.  But I fear, darling, we may have long to\nwait, and shall want all our courage.’\n\n‘I have courage for anything,’ she said, ‘I have all I want; with you and\nmy father, I am so well off, and waiting is made so happy, that I could\nwait a lifetime and not weary.’\n\nHe had a sharp pang at the mention of the Admiral.  ‘Hear me out,’ he\ncontinued.  ‘I ought to have told you this before; but it is a thought I\nshrink from; if it were possible, I should not tell you even now.  My\npoor father and I are scarce on speaking terms.’\n\n‘Your father,’ she repeated, turning pale.\n\n‘It must sound strange to you; but yet I cannot think I am to blame,’ he\nsaid.  ‘I will tell you how it happened.’\n\n‘Oh Dick!’ she said, when she had heard him to an end, ‘how brave you\nare, and how proud.  Yet I would not be proud with a father.  I would\ntell him all.’\n\n‘What!’ cried Dick, ‘go in months after, and brag that I had meant to\nthrash the man, and then didn’t.  And why?  Because my father had made a\nbigger ass of himself than I supposed.  My dear, that’s nonsense.’\n\nShe winced at his words and drew away.  ‘But when that is all he asks,’\nshe pleaded.  ‘If he only knew that you had felt that impulse, it would\nmake him so proud and happy.  He would see you were his own son after\nall, and had the same thoughts and the same chivalry of spirit.  And then\nyou did yourself injustice when you spoke just now.  It was because the\neditor was weak and poor and excused himself, that you repented your\nfirst determination.  Had he been a big red man, with whiskers, you would\nhave beaten him—you know you would—if Mr. Naseby had been ten times more\ncommitted.  Do you think, if you can tell it to me, and I understand at\nonce, that it would be more difficult to tell it to your own father, or\nthat he would not be more ready to sympathise with you than I am?  And I\nlove you, Dick; but then he is your father.’\n\n‘My dear,’ said Dick, desperately, ‘you do not understand; you do not\nknow what it is to be treated with daily want of comprehension and daily\nsmall injustices, through childhood and boyhood and manhood, until you\ndespair of a hearing, until the thing rides you like a nightmare, until\nyou almost hate the sight of the man you love, and who’s your father\nafter all.  In short, Esther, you don’t know what it is to have a father,\nand that’s what blinds you.’\n\n‘I see,’ she said musingly, ‘you mean that I am fortunate in my father.\nBut I am not so fortunate after all; you forget, I do not know him; it is\nyou who know him; he is already more your father than mine.’  And here\nshe took his hand.  Dick’s heart had grown as cold as ice.  ‘But I am\nsorry for you, too,’ she continued, ‘it must be very sad and lonely.’\n\n‘You misunderstand me,’ said Dick, chokingly.  ‘My father is the best man\nI know in all this world; he is worth a hundred of me, only he doesn’t\nunderstand me, and he can’t be made to.’\n\nThere was a silence for a while.  ‘Dick,’ she began again, ‘I am going to\nask a favour, it’s the first since you said you loved me.  May I see your\nfather—see him pass, I mean, where he will not observe me?’\n\n‘Why?’ asked Dick.\n\n‘It is a fancy; you forget, I am romantic about fathers.’\n\nThe hint was enough for Dick; he consented with haste, and full of\nhang-dog penitence and disgust, took her down by a backway and planted\nher in the shrubbery, whence she might see the Squire ride by to dinner.\nThere they both sat silent, but holding hands, for nearly half an hour.\nAt last the trotting of a horse sounded in the distance, the park gates\nopened with a clang, and then Mr. Naseby appeared, with stooping\nshoulders and a heavy, bilious countenance, languidly rising to the trot.\nEsther recognised him at once; she had often seen him before, though with\nher huge indifference for all that lay outside the circle of her love,\nshe had never so much as wondered who he was; but now she recognised him,\nand found him ten years older, leaden and springless, and stamped by an\nabiding sorrow.\n\n‘Oh Dick, Dick!’ she said, and the tears began to shine upon her face as\nshe hid it in his bosom; his own fell thickly too.  They had a sad walk\nhome, and that night, full of love and good counsel, Dick exerted every\nart to please his father, to convince him of his respect and affection,\nto heal up this breach of kindness, and reunite two hearts.  But alas!\nthe Squire was sick and peevish; he had been all day glooming over Dick’s\nestrangement—for so he put it to himself, and now with growls, cold\nwords, and the cold shoulder, he beat off all advances, and entrenched\nhimself in a just resentment.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—THE PRODIGAL FATHER MAKES HIS DEBUT AT HOME\n\n\nTHAT took place upon a Tuesday.  On the Thursday following, as Dick was\nwalking by appointment, earlier than usual, in the direction of the\ncottage, he was appalled to meet in the lane a fly from Thymebury,\ncontaining the human form of Miss M‘Glashan.  The lady did not deign to\nremark him in her passage; her face was suffused with tears, and\nexpressed much concern for the packages by which she was surrounded.  He\nstood still, and asked himself what this circumstance might portend.  It\nwas so beautiful a day that he was loth to forecast evil, yet something\nmust perforce have happened at the cottage, and that of a decisive\nnature; for here was Miss M‘Glashan on her travels, with a small\npatrimony in brown paper parcels, and the old lady’s bearing implied hot\nbattle and unqualified defeat.  Was the house to be closed against him?\nWas Esther left alone, or had some new protector made his appearance from\namong the millions of Europe?  It is the character of love to loathe the\nnear relatives of the loved one; chapters in the history of the human\nrace have justified this feeling, and the conduct of uncles, in\nparticular, has frequently met with censure from the independent\nnovelist.  Miss M‘Glashan was now seen in the rosy colours of regret;\nwhoever succeeded her, Dick felt the change would be for the worse.  He\nhurried forward in this spirit; his anxiety grew upon him with every\nstep; as he entered the garden a voice fell upon his ear, and he was once\nmore arrested, not this time by doubt, but by indubitable certainty of\nill.\n\nThe thunderbolt had fallen; the Admiral was here.\n\nDick would have retreated, in the panic terror of the moment; but Esther\nkept a bright look-out when her lover was expected.  In a twinkling she\nwas by his side, brimful of news and pleasure, too glad to notice his\nembarrassment, and in one of those golden transports of exultation which\ntranscend not only words but caresses.  She took him by the end of the\nfingers (reaching forward to take them, for her great preoccupation was\nto save time), she drew him towards her, pushed him past her in the door,\nand planted him face to face with Mr. Van Tromp, in a suit of French\ncountry velveteens and with a remarkable carbuncle on his nose.  Then, as\nthough this was the end of what she could endure in the way of joy,\nEsther turned and ran out of the room.\n\nThe two men remained looking at each other with some confusion on both\nsides.  Van Tromp was naturally the first to recover; he put out his hand\nwith a fine gesture.\n\n‘And you know my little lass, my Esther?’ he said.  ‘This is pleasant;\nthis is what I have conceived of home.  A strange word for the old rover;\nbut we all have a taste for home and the home-like, disguise it how we\nmay.  It has brought me here, Mr. Naseby,’ he concluded, with an\nintonation that would have made his fortune on the stage, so just, so\nsad, so dignified, so like a man of the world and a philosopher, ‘and you\nsee a man who is content.’\n\n‘I see,’ said Dick.\n\n‘Sit down,’ continued the parasite, setting the example.  ‘Fortune has\ngone against me.  (I am just sirrupping a little brandy—after my\njourney.)  I was going down, Mr. Naseby; between you and me, I was\n_décavé_; I borrowed fifty francs, smuggled my valise past the\nconcierge—a work of considerable tact—and here I am!’\n\n‘Yes,’ said Dick; ‘and here you are.’  He was quite idiotic.\n\nEsther, at this moment, re-entered the room.\n\n‘Are you glad to see him?’ she whispered in his ear, the pleasure in her\nvoice almost bursting through the whisper into song.\n\n‘Oh yes,’ said Dick, ‘very.’\n\n‘I knew you would be,’ she replied; ‘I told him how you loved him.’\n\n‘Help yourself,’ said the Admiral, ‘help yourself; and let us drink to a\nnew existence.’\n\n‘To a new existence,’ repeated Dick; and he raised the tumbler to his\nlips, but set it down untasted.  He had had enough of novelties for one\nday.\n\nEsther was sitting on a stool beside her father’s feet, holding her knees\nin her arms, and looking with pride from one to the other of her two\nvisitors.  Her eyes were so bright that you were never sure if there were\ntears in them or not; little voluptuous shivers ran about her body;\nsometimes she nestled her chin into her throat, sometimes threw back her\nhead, with ecstasy; in a word, she was in that state when it is said of\npeople that they cannot contain themselves for happiness.  It would be\nhard to exaggerate the agony of Richard.\n\nAnd, in the meantime, Van Tromp ran on interminably.\n\n‘I never forget a friend,’ said he, ‘nor yet an enemy: of the latter, I\nnever had but two—myself and the public; and I fancy I have had my\nvengeance pretty freely out of both.’  He chuckled.  ‘But those days are\ndone.  Van Tromp is no more.  He was a man who had successes; I believe\nyou knew I had successes—to which we shall refer no farther,’ pulling\ndown his neckcloth with a smile.  ‘That man exists no more: by an\nexercise of will I have destroyed him.  There is something like it in the\npoets.  First, a brilliant and conspicuous career—the observed, I may\nsay, of all observers, including the bum-bailie: and then, presto! a\nquiet, sly, old, rustic _bonhomme_, cultivating roses.  In Paris, Mr.\nNaseby—’\n\n‘Call him Richard, father,’ said Esther.\n\n‘Richard, if he will allow me.  Indeed, we are old friends, and now near\nneighbours; and, _à propos_, how are we off for neighbours, Richard?  The\ncottage stands, I think, upon your father’s land—a family which I\nrespect—and the wood, I understand, is Lord Trevanion’s.  Not that I\ncare; I am an old Bohemian.  I have cut society with a cut direct; I cut\nit when I was prosperous, and now I reap my reward, and can cut it with\ndignity in my declension.  These are our little _amours propres_, my\ndaughter: your father must respect himself.  Thank you, yes; just a\nleetle, leetle, tiny—thanks, thanks; you spoil me.  But, as I was saying,\nRichard, or was about to say, my daughter has been allowed to rust; her\naunt was a mere duenna; hence, in parenthesis, Richard, her distrust of\nme; my nature and that of the duenna are poles asunder—poles!  But, now\nthat I am here, now that I have given up the fight, and live henceforth\nfor one only of my works—I have the modesty to say it is my best—my\ndaughter—well, we shall put all that to rights.  The neighbours,\nRichard?’\n\nDick was understood to say that there were many good families in the Vale\nof Thyme.\n\n‘You shall introduce us,’ said the Admiral.\n\nDick’s shirt was wet; he made a lumbering excuse to go; which Esther\nexplained to herself by a fear of intrusion, and so set down to the merit\nside of Dick’s account, while she proceeded to detain him.\n\n‘Before our walk?’ she cried.  ‘Never!  I must have my walk.’\n\n‘Let us all go,’ said the Admiral, rising.\n\n‘You do not know that you are wanted,’ she cried, leaning on his shoulder\nwith a caress.  ‘I might wish to speak to my old friend about my new\nfather.  But you shall come to-day, you shall do all you want; I have set\nmy heart on spoiling you.’\n\n‘I will just take _one_ drop more,’ said the Admiral, stooping to help\nhimself to brandy.  ‘It is surprising how this journey has fatigued me.\nBut I am growing old, I am growing old, I am growing old, and—I regret to\nadd—bald.’\n\nHe cocked a white wide-awake coquettishly upon his head—the habit of the\nlady-killer clung to him; and Esther had already thrown on her hat, and\nwas ready, while he was still studying the result in a mirror: the\ncarbuncle had somewhat painfully arrested his attention.\n\n‘We are papa now; we must be respectable,’ he said to Dick, in\nexplanation of his dandyism: and then he went to a bundle and chose\nhimself a staff.  Where were the elegant canes of his Parisian epoch?\nThis was a support for age, and designed for rustic scenes.  Dick began\nto see and appreciate the man’s enjoyment in a new part, when he saw how\ncarefully he had ‘made it up.’  He had invented a gait for this first\ncountry stroll with his daughter, which was admirably in key.  He walked\nwith fatigue, he leaned upon the staff; he looked round him with a sad,\nsmiling sympathy on all that he beheld; he even asked the name of a\nplant, and rallied himself gently for an old town bird, ignorant of\nnature.  ‘This country life will make me young again,’ he sighed.  They\nreached the top of the hill towards the first hour of evening; the sun\nwas descending heaven, the colour had all drawn into the west; the hills\nwere modelled in their least contour by the soft, slanting shine; and the\nwide moorlands, veined with glens and hazelwoods, ran west and north in a\nhazy glory of light.  Then the painter wakened in Van Tromp.\n\n‘Gad, Dick,’ he cried, ‘what value!’\n\nAn ode in four hundred lines would not have seemed so touching to Esther;\nher eyes filled with happy tears; yes, here was the father of whom she\nhad dreamed, whom Dick had described; simple, enthusiastic, unworldly,\nkind, a painter at heart, and a fine gentleman in manner.\n\nAnd just then the Admiral perceived a house by the wayside, and something\ndepending over the house door which might be construed as a sign by the\nhopeful and thirsty.\n\n‘Is that,’ he asked, pointing with his stick, ‘an inn?’\n\nThere was a marked change in his voice, as though he attached importance\nto the inquiry: Esther listened, hoping she should hear wit or wisdom.\n\nDick said it was.\n\n‘You know it?’ inquired the Admiral.\n\n‘I have passed it a hundred times, but that is all,’ replied Dick.\n\n‘Ah,’ said Van Tromp, with a smile, and shaking his head; ‘you are not an\nold campaigner; you have the world to learn.  Now I, you see, find an inn\nso very near my own home, and my first thought is my neighbours.  I shall\ngo forward and make my neighbours’ acquaintance; no, you needn’t come; I\nshall not be a moment.’\n\nAnd he walked off briskly towards the inn, leaving Dick alone with Esther\non the road.\n\n‘Dick,’ she exclaimed, ‘I am so glad to get a word with you; I am so\nhappy, I have such a thousand things to say; and I want you to do me a\nfavour.  Imagine, he has come without a paint-box, without an easel; and\nI want him to have all.  I want you to get them for me in Thymebury.  You\nsaw, this moment, how his heart turned to painting.  They can’t live\nwithout it,’ she added; meaning perhaps Van Tromp and Michel Angelo.\n\nUp to that moment, she had observed nothing amiss in Dick’s behaviour.\nShe was too happy to be curious; and his silence, in presence of the\ngreat and good being whom she called her father, had seemed both natural\nand praiseworthy.  But now that they were alone, she became conscious of\na barrier between her lover and herself, and alarm sprang up in her\nheart.\n\n‘Dick,’ she cried, ‘you don’t love me.’\n\n‘I do that,’ he said heartily.\n\n‘But you are unhappy; you are strange; you—you are not glad to see my\nfather,’ she concluded, with a break in her voice.\n\n‘Esther,’ he said, ‘I tell you that I love you; if you love me, you know\nwhat that means, and that all I wish is to see you happy.  Do you think I\ncannot enjoy your pleasures?  Esther, I do.  If I am uneasy, if I am\nalarmed, if—.  Oh, believe me, try and believe in me,’ he cried, giving\nup argument with perhaps a happy inspiration.\n\nBut the girl’s suspicions were aroused; and though she pressed the matter\nno farther (indeed, her father was already seen returning), it by no\nmeans left her thoughts.  At one moment she simply resented the\nselfishness of a man who had obtruded his dark looks and passionate\nlanguage on her joy; for there is nothing that a woman can less easily\nforgive than the language of a passion which, even if only for the\nmoment, she does not share.  At another, she suspected him of jealousy\nagainst her father; and for that, although she could see excuses for it,\nshe yet despised him.  And at least, in one way or the other, here was\nthe dangerous beginning of a separation between two hearts.  Esther found\nherself at variance with her sweetest friend; she could no longer look\ninto his heart and find it written with the same language as her own; she\ncould no longer think of him as the sun which radiated happiness upon her\nlife, for she had turned to him once, and he had breathed upon her black\nand chilly, radiated blackness and frost.  To put the whole matter in a\nword, she was beginning, although ever so slightly, to fall out of love.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—THE PRODIGAL FATHER GOES ON FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH\n\n\nWE will not follow all the steps of the Admiral’s return and\ninstallation, but hurry forward towards the catastrophe, merely\nchronicling by the way a few salient incidents, wherein we must rely\nentirely upon the evidence of Richard, for Esther to this day has never\nopened her mouth upon this trying passage of her life, and as for the\nAdmiral—well, that naval officer, although still alive, and now more\nsuitably installed in a seaport town where he has a telescope and a flag\nin his front garden, is incapable of throwing the slightest gleam of\nlight upon the affair.  Often and often has he remarked to the present\nwriter: ‘If I know what it was all about, sir, I’ll be—’ in short, be\nwhat I hope he will not.  And then he will look across at his daughter’s\nportrait, a photograph, shake his head with an amused appearance, and mix\nhimself another grog by way of consolation.  Once I heard him go farther,\nand express his feelings with regard to Esther in a single but eloquent\nword.  ‘A minx, sir,’ he said, not in anger, rather in amusement: and he\ncordially drank her health upon the back of it.  His worst enemy must\nadmit him to be a man without malice; he never bore a grudge in his life,\nlacking the necessary taste and industry of attention.\n\nYet it was during this obscure period that the drama was really\nperformed; and its scene was in the heart of Esther, shut away from all\neyes.  Had this warm, upright, sullen girl been differently used by\ndestiny, had events come upon her even in a different succession, for\nsome things lead easily to others, the whole course of this tale would\nhave been changed, and Esther never would have run away.  As it was,\nthrough a series of acts and words of which we know but few, and a series\nof thoughts which any one may imagine for himself, she was awakened in\nfour days from the dream of a life.\n\nThe first tangible cause of disenchantment was when Dick brought home a\npainter’s arsenal on Friday evening.  The Admiral was in the\nchimney-corner, once more ‘sirrupping’ some brandy and water, and Esther\nsat at the table at work.  They both came forward to greet the new\narrival; and the girl, relieving him of his monstrous burthen, proceeded\nto display her offerings to her father.  Van Tromp’s countenance fell\nseveral degrees; he became quite querulous.\n\n‘God bless me,’ he said; and then, ‘I must really ask you not to\ninterfere, child,’ in a tone of undisguised hostility.\n\n‘Father,’ she said, ‘forgive me; I knew you had given up your art—’\n\n‘Oh yes!’ cried the Admiral; ‘I’ve done with it to the judgment-day!’\n\n‘Pardon me again,’ she said firmly, ‘but I do not, I cannot think that\nyou are right in this.  Suppose the world is unjust, suppose that no one\nunderstands you, you have still a duty to yourself.  And, oh, don’t spoil\nthe pleasure of your coming home to me; show me that you can be my father\nand yet not neglect your destiny.  I am not like some daughters; I will\nnot be jealous of your art, and I will try to understand it.’\n\nThe situation was odiously farcical.  Richard groaned under it; he longed\nto leap forward and denounce the humbug.  And the humbug himself?  Do you\nfancy he was easier in his mind?  I am sure, on the other hand, that he\nwas acutely miserable; and he betrayed his sufferings by a perfectly\nsilly and undignified access of temper, during which he broke his pipe in\nseveral pieces, threw his brandy and water in the fire, and employed\nwords which were very plain although the drift of them was somewhat\nvague.  It was of very brief duration.  Van Tromp was himself again, and\nin a most delightful humour within three minutes of the first explosion.\n\n‘I am an old fool,’ he said frankly.  ‘I was spoiled when a child.  As\nfor you, Esther, you take after your mother; you have a morbid sense of\nduty, particularly for others; strive against it, my dear—strive against\nit.  And as for the pigments, well, I’ll use them, some of these days;\nand to show that I’m in earnest, I’ll get Dick here to prepare a canvas.’\n\nDick was put to this menial task forthwith, the Admiral not even watching\nhow he did, but quite occupied with another grog and a pleasant vein of\ntalk.\n\nA little after Esther arose, and making some pretext, good or bad, went\noff to bed.  Dick was left hobbled by the canvas, and was subjected to\nVan Tromp for about an hour.\n\nThe next day, Saturday, it is believed that little intercourse took place\nbetween Esther and her father; but towards the afternoon Dick met the\nlatter returning from the direction of the inn, where he had struck up\nquite a friendship with the landlord.  Dick wondered who paid for these\nexcursions, and at the thought that the reprobate must get his pocket\nmoney where he got his board and lodging, from poor Esther’s generosity,\nhe had it almost in his heart to knock the old gentleman down.  He, on\nhis part, was full of airs and graces and geniality.\n\n‘Dear Dick,’ he said, taking his arm, ‘this is neighbourly of you; it\nshows your tact to meet me when I had a wish for you.  I am in pleasant\nspirits; and it is then that I desire a friend.’\n\n‘I am glad to hear you are so happy,’ retorted Dick bitterly.  ‘There’s\ncertainly not much to trouble _you_.’\n\n‘No,’ assented the Admiral, ‘not much.  I got out of it in time; and\nhere—well, here everything pleases me.  I am plain in my tastes.  ‘_A\npropos_, you have never asked me how I liked my daughter?’\n\n‘No,’ said Dick roundly; ‘I certainly have not.’\n\n‘Meaning you will not.  And why, Dick?  She is my daughter, of course;\nbut then I am a man of the world and a man of taste, and perfectly\nqualified to give an opinion with impartiality—yes, Dick, with\nimpartiality.  Frankly, I am not disappointed in her.  She has good\nlooks; she has them from her mother.  So I may say I _chose_ her looks.\nShe is devoted, quite devoted to me—’\n\n‘She is the best woman in the world!’ broke out Dick.\n\n‘Dick,’ cried the Admiral, stopping short; ‘I have been expecting this.\nLet us—let us go back to the “Trevanion Arms” and talk this matter out\nover a bottle.’\n\n‘Certainly not,’ went Dick.  ‘You have had far too much already.’\n\nThe parasite was on the point of resenting this; but a look at Dick’s\nface, and some recollection of the terms on which they had stood in\nParis, came to the aid of his wisdom and restrained him.\n\n‘As you please,’ he said; ‘although I don’t know what you mean—nor care.\nBut let us walk, if you prefer it.  You are still a young man; when you\nare my age—  But, however, to continue.  You please me, Dick; you have\npleased me from the first; and to say truth, Esther is a trifle\nfantastic, and will be better when she is married.  She has means of her\nown, as of course you are aware.  They come, like the looks, from her\npoor, dear, good creature of a mother.  She was blessed in her mother.  I\nmean she shall be blessed in her husband, and you are the man, Dick, you\nand not another.  This very night I will sound her affections.’\n\nDick stood aghast.\n\n‘Mr. Van Tromp, I implore you,’ he said; ‘do what you please with\nyourself, but, for God’s sake, let your daughter alone.’\n\n‘It is my duty,’ replied the Admiral, ‘and between ourselves, you rogue,\nmy inclination too.  I am as matchmaking as a dowager.  It will be more\ndiscreet for you to stay away to-night.  Farewell.  You leave your case\nin good hands; I have the tact of these little matters by heart; it is\nnot my first attempt.’\n\nAll arguments were in vain; the old rascal stuck to his point; nor did\nRichard conceal from himself how seriously this might injure his\nprospects, and he fought hard.  Once there came a glimmer of hope.  The\nAdmiral again proposed an adjournment to the ‘Trevanion Arms,’ and when\nDick had once more refused, it hung for a moment in the balance whether\nor not the old toper would return there by himself.  Had he done so, of\ncourse Dick could have taken to his heels, and warned Esther of what was\ncoming, and of how it had begun.  But the Admiral, after a pause, decided\nfor the brandy at home, and made off in that direction.\n\nWe have no details of the sounding.\n\nNext day the Admiral was observed in the parish church, very properly\ndressed.  He found the places, and joined in response and hymn, as to the\nmanner born; and his appearance, as he intended it should, attracted some\nattention among the worshippers.  Old Naseby, for instance, had observed\nhim.\n\n‘There was a drunken-looking blackguard opposite us in church,’ he said\nto his son as they drove home; ‘do you know who he was?’\n\n‘Some fellow—Van Tromp, I believe,’ said Dick.\n\n‘A foreigner, too!’ observed the Squire.\n\nDick could not sufficiently congratulate himself on the escape he had\neffected.  Had the Admiral met him with his father, what would have been\nthe result?  And could such a catastrophe be long postponed?  It seemed\nto him as if the storm were nearly ripe; and it was so more nearly than\nhe thought.\n\nHe did not go to the cottage in the afternoon, withheld by fear and\nshame; but when dinner was over at Naseby House, and the Squire had gone\noff into a comfortable doze, Dick slipped out of the room, and ran across\ncountry, in part to save time, in part to save his own courage from\ngrowing cold; for he now hated the notion of the cottage or the Admiral,\nand if he did not hate, at least feared to think of Esther.  He had no\nclue to her reflections; but he could not conceal from his own heart that\nhe must have sunk in her esteem, and the spectacle of her infatuation\ngalled him like an insult.\n\nHe knocked and was admitted.  The room looked very much as on his last\nvisit, with Esther at the table and Van Tromp beside the fire; but the\nexpression of the two faces told a very different story.  The girl was\npaler than usual; her eyes were dark, the colour seemed to have faded\nfrom round about them, and her swiftest glance was as intent as a stare.\nThe appearance of the Admiral, on the other hand, was rosy, and flabby,\nand moist; his jowl hung over his shirt collar, his smile was loose and\nwandering, and he had so far relaxed the natural control of his eyes,\nthat one of them was aimed inward, as if to watch the growth of the\ncarbuncle.  We are warned against bad judgments; but the Admiral was\ncertainly not sober.  He made no attempt to rise when Richard entered,\nbut waved his pipe flightily in the air, and gave a leer of welcome.\nEsther took as little notice of him as might be.\n\n‘Aha!  Dick!’ cried the painter.  ‘I’ve been to church; I have, upon my\nword.  And I saw you there, though you didn’t see me.  And I saw a\ndevilish pretty woman, by Gad.  If it were not for this baldness, and a\nkind of crapulous air I can’t disguise from myself—if it weren’t for this\nand that and t’other thing—I—I’ve forgot what I was saying.  Not that\nthat matters, I’ve heaps of things to say.  I’m in a communicative vein\nto-night.  I’ll let out all my cats, even unto seventy times seven.  I’m\nin what I call _the_ stage, and all I desire is a listener, although he\nwere deaf, to be as happy as Nebuchadnezzar.’\n\nOf the two hours which followed upon this it is unnecessary to give more\nthan a sketch.  The Admiral was extremely silly, now and then amusing,\nand never really offensive.  It was plain that he kept in view the\npresence of his daughter, and chose subjects and a character of language\nthat should not offend a lady.  On almost any other occasion Dick would\nhave enjoyed the scene.  Van Tromp’s egotism, flown with drink, struck a\npitch above mere vanity.  He became candid and explanatory; sought to\ntake his auditors entirely into his confidence, and tell them his inmost\nconviction about himself.  Between his self-knowledge, which was\nconsiderable, and his vanity, which was immense, he had created a strange\nhybrid animal, and called it by his own name.  How he would plume his\nfeathers over virtues which would have gladdened the heart of Cæsar or\nSt. Paul; and anon, complete his own portrait with one of those touches\nof pitiless realism which the satirist so often seeks in vain.\n\n‘Now, there’s Dick,’ he said, ‘he’s shrewd; he saw through me the first\ntime we met, and told me so—told me so to my face, which I had the virtue\nto keep.  I bear you no malice for it, Dick; you were right; I am a\nhumbug.’\n\nYou may fancy how Esther quailed at this new feature of the meeting\nbetween her two idols.\n\nAnd then, again, in a parenthesis:—\n\n‘That,’ said Van Tromp, ‘was when I had to paint those dirty daubs of\nmine.’\n\nAnd a little further on, laughingly said perhaps, but yet with an air of\ntruth:—\n\n‘I never had the slightest hesitation in sponging upon any human\ncreature.’\n\nThereupon Dick got up.\n\n‘I think perhaps,’ he said, ‘we had better all be thinking of going to\nbed.’  And he smiled with a feeble and deprecatory smile.\n\n‘Not at all,’ cried the Admiral, ‘I know a trick worth two of that.  Puss\nhere,’ indicating his daughter, ‘shall go to bed; and you and I will keep\nit up till all’s blue.’\n\nThereupon Esther arose in sullen glory.  She had sat and listened for two\nmortal hours while her idol defiled himself and sneered away his godhead.\nOne by one, her illusions had departed.  And now he wished to order her\nto bed in her own house! now he called her Puss! now, even as he uttered\nthe words, toppling on his chair, he broke the stem of his tobacco-pipe\nin three!  Never did the sheep turn upon her shearer with a more\ncommanding front.  Her voice was calm, her enunciation a little slow, but\nperfectly distinct, and she stood before him as she spoke, in the\nsimplest and most maidenly attitude.\n\n‘No,’ she said, ‘Mr. Naseby will have the goodness to go home at once,\nand you will go to bed.’\n\nThe broken fragments of pipe fell from the Admiral’s fingers; he seemed\nby his countenance to have lived too long in a world unworthy of him; but\nit is an odd circumstance, he attempted no reply, and sat thunderstruck,\nwith open mouth.\n\nDick she motioned sharply towards the door, and he could only obey her.\nIn the porch, finding she was close behind him, he ventured to pause and\nwhisper, ‘You have done right.’\n\n‘I have done as I pleased,’ she said.  ‘Can he paint?’\n\n‘Many people like his paintings,’ returned Dick, in stifled tones; ‘I\nnever did; I never said I did,’ he added, fiercely defending himself\nbefore he was attacked.\n\n‘I ask you if he can paint.  I will not be put off.  _Can_ he paint?’ she\nrepeated.\n\n‘No,’ said Dick.\n\n‘Does he even like it?’\n\n‘Not now, I believe.’\n\n‘And he is drunk?’—she leaned upon the word with hatred.\n\n‘He has been drinking.’\n\n‘Go,’ she said, and was turning to re-enter the house when another\nthought arrested her.  ‘Meet me to-morrow morning at the stile,’ she\nsaid.\n\n‘I will,’ replied Dick.\n\nAnd then the door closed behind her, and Dick was alone in the darkness.\nThere was still a chink of light above the sill, a warm, mild glow behind\nthe window; the roof of the cottage and some of the banks and hazels were\ndefined in denser darkness against the sky; but all else was formless,\nbreathless, and noiseless like the pit.  Dick remained as she had left\nhim, standing squarely upon one foot and resting only on the toe of the\nother, and as he stood he listened with his soul.  The sound of a chair\npushed sharply over the floor startled his heart into his mouth; but the\nsilence which had thus been disturbed settled back again at once upon the\ncottage and its vicinity.  What took place during this interval is a\nsecret from the world of men; but when it was over the voice of Esther\nspoke evenly and without interruption for perhaps half a minute, and as\nsoon as that ceased heavy and uncertain footfalls crossed the parlour and\nmounted lurching up the stairs.  The girl had tamed her father, Van Tromp\nhad gone obediently to bed: so much was obvious to the watcher in the\nroad.  And yet he still waited, straining his ears, and with terror and\nsickness at his heart; for if Esther had followed her father, if she had\neven made one movement in this great conspiracy of men and nature to be\nstill, Dick must have had instant knowledge of it from his station before\nthe door; and if she had not moved, must she not have fainted? or might\nshe not be dead?\n\nHe could hear the cottage clock deliberately measure out the seconds;\ntime stood still with him; an almost superstitious terror took command of\nhis faculties; at last, he could bear no more, and, springing through the\nlittle garden in two bounds, he put his face against the window.  The\nblind, which had not been drawn fully down, left an open chink about an\ninch in height along the bottom of the glass, and the whole parlour was\nthus exposed to Dick’s investigation.  Esther sat upright at the table,\nher head resting on her hand, her eyes fixed upon the candle.  Her brows\nwere slightly bent, her mouth slightly open; her whole attitude so still\nand settled that Dick could hardly fancy that she breathed.  She had not\nstirred at the sound of Dick’s arrival.  Soon after, making a\nconsiderable disturbance amid the vast silence of the night, the clock\nlifted up its voice, whined for a while like a partridge, and then eleven\ntimes hooted like a cuckoo.  Still Esther continued immovable and gazed\nupon the candle.  Midnight followed, and then one of the morning; and\nstill she had not stirred, nor had Richard Naseby dared to quit the\nwindow.  And then, about half-past one, the candle she had been thus\nintently watching flared up into a last blaze of paper, and she leaped to\nher feet with an ejaculation, looked about her once, blew out the light,\nturned round, and was heard rapidly mounting the staircase in the dark.\n\nDick was left once more alone to darkness and to that dulled and dogged\nstate of mind when a man thinks that Misery must now have done her worst,\nand is almost glad to think so.  He turned and walked slowly towards the\nstile; she had told him no hour, and he was determined, whenever she\ncame, that she should find him waiting.  As he got there the day began to\ndawn, and he leaned over a hurdle and beheld the shadows flee away.  Up\nwent the sun at last out of a bank of clouds that were already disbanding\nin the east; a herald wind had already sprung up to sweep the leafy earth\nand scatter the congregated dewdrops.  ‘Alas!’ thought Dick Naseby, ‘how\ncan any other day come so distastefully to me?’  He still wanted his\nexperience of the morrow.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—THE ELOPEMENT\n\n\nIT was probably on the stroke of ten, and Dick had been half asleep for\nsome time against the bank, when Esther came up the road carrying a\nbundle.  Some kind of instinct, or perhaps the distant light footfalls,\nrecalled him, while she was still a good way off, to the possession of\nhis faculties, and he half raised himself and blinked upon the world.  It\ntook him some time to recollect his thoughts.  He had awakened with a\ncertain blank and childish sense of pleasure, like a man who had received\na legacy overnight; but this feeling gradually died away, and was then\nsuddenly and stunningly succeeded by a conviction of the truth.  The\nwhole story of the past night sprang into his mind with every detail, as\nby an exercise of the direct and speedy sense of sight, and he arose from\nthe ditch and, with rueful courage, went to meet his love.\n\nShe came up to him walking steady and fast, her face still pale, but to\nall appearance perfectly composed; and she showed neither surprise,\nrelief, nor pleasure at finding her lover on the spot.  Nor did she offer\nhim her hand.\n\n‘Here I am,’ said he.\n\n‘Yes,’ she replied; and then, without a pause or any change of voice, ‘I\nwant you to take me away,’ she added.\n\n‘Away?’ he repeated.  ‘How?  Where?’\n\n‘To-day,’ she said.  ‘I do not care where it is, but I want you to take\nme away.’\n\n‘For how long?  I do not understand,’ gasped Dick.\n\n‘I shall never come back here any more,’ was all she answered.\n\nWild words uttered, as these were, with perfect quiet of manner and\nvoice, exercise a double influence on the hearer’s mind.  Dick was\nconfounded; he recovered from astonishment only to fall into doubt and\nalarm.  He looked upon her frozen attitude, so discouraging for a lover\nto behold, and recoiled from the thoughts which it suggested.\n\n‘To me?’ he asked.  ‘Are you coming to me, Esther?’\n\n‘I want you to take me away,’ she repeated with weary impatience.  ‘Take\nme away—take me away from here.’\n\nThe situation was not sufficiently defined.  Dick asked himself with\nconcern whether she were altogether in her right wits.  To take her away,\nto marry her, to work off his hands for her support, Dick was content to\ndo all this; yet he required some show of love upon her part.  He was not\none of those tough-hided and small-hearted males who would marry their\nlove at the point of the bayonet rather than not marry her at all.  He\ndesired that a woman should come to his arms with an attractive\nwillingness, if not with ardour.  And Esther’s bearing was more that of\ndespair than that of love.  It chilled him and taught him wisdom.\n\n‘Dearest,’ he urged, ‘tell me what you wish, and you shall have it; tell\nme your thoughts, and then I can advise you.  But to go from here without\na plan, without forethought, in the heat of a moment, is madder than\nmadness, and can help nothing.  I am not speaking like a man, but I speak\nthe truth; and I tell you again, the thing’s absurd, and wrong, and\nhurtful.’\n\nShe looked at him with a lowering, languid look of wrath.\n\n‘So you will not take me?’ she said.  ‘Well, I will go alone.’\n\nAnd she began to step forward on her way.  But he threw himself before\nher.\n\n‘Esther, Esther!’ he cried.\n\n‘Let me go—don’t touch me—what right have you to interfere?  Who are you,\nto touch me?’ she flashed out, shrill with anger.\n\nThen, being made bold by her violence, he took her firmly, almost\nroughly, by the arm, and held her while he spoke.\n\n‘You know well who I am, and what I am, and that I love you.  You say I\nwill not help you; but your heart knows the contrary.  It is you who will\nnot help me; for you will not tell me what you want.  You see—or you\ncould see, if you took the pains to look—how I have waited here all night\nto be ready at your service.  I only asked information; I only urged you\nto consider; and I still urge and beg you to think better of your\nfancies.  But if your mind is made up, so be it; I will beg no longer; I\ngive you my orders; and I will not allow—not allow you to go hence\nalone.’\n\nShe looked at him for awhile with cold, unkind scrutiny like one who\ntries the temper of a tool.\n\n‘Well, take me away, then,’ she said with a sigh.\n\n‘Good,’ said Dick.  ‘Come with me to the stables; there we shall get the\npony-trap and drive to the junction.  To-night you shall be in London.  I\nam yours so wholly that no words can make me more so; and, besides, you\nknow it, and the words are needless.  May God help me to be good to you,\nEsther—may God help me! for I see that you will not.’\n\nSo, without more speech, they set out together, and were already got some\ndistance from the spot, ere he observed that she was still carrying the\nhand-bag.  She gave it up to him, passively, but when he offered her his\narm, merely shook her head and pursed up her lips.  The sun shone clearly\nand pleasantly; the wind was fresh and brisk upon their faces, and smelt\nracily of woods and meadows.  As they went down into the valley of the\nThyme, the babble of the stream rose into the air like a perennial\nlaughter.  On the far-away hills, sun-burst and shadow raced along the\nslopes and leaped from peak to peak.  Earth, air and water, each seemed\nin better health and had more of the shrewd salt of life in them than\nupon ordinary mornings; and from east to west, from the lowest glen to\nthe height of heaven, from every look and touch and scent, a human\ncreature could gather the most encouraging intelligence as to the\ndurability and spirit of the universe.\n\nThrough all this walked Esther, picking her small steps like a bird, but\nsilent and with a cloud under her thick eyebrows.  She seemed insensible,\nnot only of nature, but of the presence of her companion.  She was\naltogether engrossed in herself, and looked neither to right nor to left,\nbut straight before her on the road.  When they came to the bridge,\nhowever, she halted, leaned on the parapet, and stared for a moment at\nthe clear, brown pool, and swift, transient snowdrift of the rapids.\n\n‘I am going to drink,’ she said; and descended the winding footpath to\nthe margin.\n\nThere she drank greedily in her hands and washed her temples with water.\nThe coolness seemed to break, for an instant, the spell that lay upon\nher; for, instead of hastening forward again in her dull, indefatigable\ntramp, she stood still where she was, for near a minute, looking straight\nbefore her.  And Dick, from above on the bridge where he stood to watch\nher, saw a strange, equivocal smile dawn slowly on her face and pass away\nagain at once and suddenly, leaving her as grave as ever; and the sense\nof distance, which it is so cruel for a lover to endure, pressed with\nevery moment more heavily on her companion.  Her thoughts were all\nsecret; her heart was locked and bolted; and he stood without, vainly\nwooing her with his eves.\n\n‘Do you feel better?’ asked Dick, as she at last rejoined him; and after\nthe constraint of so long a silence, his voice sounded foreign to his own\nears.\n\nShe looked at him for an appreciable fraction of a minute ere she\nanswered, and when she did, it was in the monosyllable—‘Yes.’\n\nDick’s solicitude was nipped and frosted.  His words died away on his\ntongue.  Even his eyes, despairing of encouragement, ceased to attend on\nhers.  And they went on in silence through Kirton hamlet, where an old\nman followed them with his eyes, and perhaps envied them their youth and\nlove; and across the Ivy beck where the mill was splashing and grumbling\nlow thunder to itself in the chequered shadow of the dell, and the miller\nbefore the door was beating flour from his hands as he whistled a\nmodulation; and up by the high spinney, whence they saw the mountains\nupon either hand; and down the hill again to the back courts and offices\nof Naseby House.  Esther had kept ahead all the way, and Dick plodded\nobediently in her wake; but as they neared the stables, he pushed on and\ntook the lead.  He would have preferred her to await him in the road\nwhile he went on and brought the carriage back, but after so many\nrepulses and rebuffs he lacked courage to offer the suggestion.  Perhaps,\ntoo, he felt it wiser to keep his convoy within sight.  So they entered\nthe yard in Indian file, like a tramp and his wife.\n\nThe grooms eyebrows rose as he received the order for the pony-phaeton,\nand kept rising during all his preparations.  Esther stood bolt upright\nand looked steadily at some chickens in the corner of the yard.  Master\nRichard himself, thought the groom, was not in his ordinary; for in\ntruth, he carried the hand-bag like a talisman, and either stood\nlistless, or set off suddenly walking in one direction after another with\nbrisk, decisive footsteps.  Moreover he had apparently neglected to wash\nhis hands, and bore the air of one returning from a prolonged nutting\nramble.  Upon the groom’s countenance there began to grow up an\nexpression as of one about to whistle.  And hardly had the carriage\nturned the corner and rattled into the high road with this inexplicable\npair, than the whistle broke forth—prolonged, and low and tremulous; and\nthe groom, already so far relieved, vented the rest of his surprise in\none simple English word, friendly to the mouth of Jack-tar and the sooty\npitman, and hurried to spread the news round the servants’ hall of Naseby\nHouse.  Luncheon would be on the table in little beyond an hour; and the\nSquire, on sitting down, would hardly fail to ask for Master Richard.\nHence, as the intelligent reader can foresee, this groom has a part to\nplay in the imbroglio.\n\nMeantime, Dick had been thinking deeply and bitterly.  It seemed to him\nas if his love had gone from him, indeed, yet gone but a little way; as\nif he needed but to find the right touch or intonation, and her heart\nwould recognise him and be melted.  Yet he durst not open his mouth, and\ndrove in silence till they had passed the main park-gates and turned into\nthe cross-cut lane along the wall.  Then it seemed to him as if it must\nbe now, or never.\n\n‘Can’t you see you are killing me?’ he cried.  ‘Speak to me, look at me,\ntreat me like a human man.’\n\nShe turned slowly and looked him in the face with eyes that seemed\nkinder.  He dropped the reins and caught her hand, and she made no\nresistance, although her touch was unresponsive.  But when, throwing one\narm round her waist, he sought to kiss her lips, not like a lover indeed,\nnot because he wanted to do so, but as a desperate man who puts his\nfortunes to the touch, she drew away from him, with a knot in her\nforehead, backed and shied about fiercely with her head, and pushed him\nfrom her with her hand.  Then there was no room left for doubt, and Dick\nsaw, as clear as sunlight, that she had a distaste or nourished a grudge\nagainst him.\n\n‘Then you don’t love me?’ he said, drawing back from her, he also, as\nthough her touch had burnt him; and then, as she made no answer, he\nrepeated with another intonation, imperious and yet still pathetic, ‘You\ndon’t love me, _do_ you, _do_ you?’\n\n‘I don’t know,’ she replied.  ‘Why do you ask me?  Oh, how should I know?\nIt has all been lies together—lies, and lies, and lies!’\n\nHe cried her name sharply, like a man who has taken a physical hurt, and\nthat was the last word that either of them spoke until they reached\nThymebury Junction.\n\nThis was a station isolated in the midst of moorlands, yet lying on the\ngreat up line to London.  The nearest town, Thymebury itself, was seven\nmiles distant along the branch they call the Vale of Thyme Railway.  It\nwas now nearly half an hour past noon, the down train had just gone by,\nand there would be no more traffic at the junction until half-past three,\nwhen the local train comes in to meet the up express at a quarter before\nfour.  The stationmaster had already gone off to his garden, which was\nhalf a mile away in a hollow of the moor; a porter, who was just leaving,\ntook charge of the phaeton, and promised to return it before night to\nNaseby House; only a deaf, snuffy, and stern old man remained to play\npropriety for Dick and Esther.\n\nBefore the phaeton had driven off, the girl had entered the station and\nseated herself upon a bench.  The endless, empty moorlands stretched\nbefore her, entirely unenclosed, and with no boundary but the horizon.\nTwo lines of rails, a waggon shed, and a few telegraph posts, alone\ndiversified the outlook.  As for sounds, the silence was unbroken save by\nthe chant of the telegraph wires and the crying of the plovers on the\nwaste.  With the approach of midday the wind had more and more fallen, it\nwas now sweltering hot and the air trembled in the sunshine.\n\nDick paused for an instant on the threshold of the platform.  Then, in\ntwo steps, he was by her side and speaking almost with a sob.\n\n‘Esther,’ he said, ‘have pity on me.  What have I done?  Can you not\nforgive me?  Esther, you loved me once—can you not love me still?’\n\n‘How can I tell you?  How am I to know?’ she answered.  ‘You are all a\nlie to me—all a lie from first to last.  You were laughing at my folly,\nplaying with me like a child, at the very time when you declared you\nloved me.  Which was true? was any of it true? or was it all, all a\nmockery?  I am weary trying to find out.  And you say I loved you; I\nloved my father’s friend.  I never loved, I never heard of, you, until\nthat man came home and I began to find myself deceived.  Give me back my\nfather, be what you were before, and you may talk of love indeed!’\n\n‘Then you cannot forgive me—cannot?’ he asked.\n\n‘I have nothing to forgive,’ she answered.  ‘You do not understand.’\n\n‘Is that your last word, Esther?’ said he, very white, and biting his lip\nto keep it still.\n\n‘Yes, that is my last word,’ replied she.\n\n‘Then we are here on false pretences, and we stay here no longer,’ he\nsaid.  ‘Had you still loved me, right or wrong, I should have taken you\naway, because then I could have made you happy.  But as it is—I must\nspeak plainly—what you propose is degrading to you, and an insult to me,\nand a rank unkindness to your father.  Your father may be this or that,\nbut you should use him like a fellow-creature.’\n\n‘What do you mean?’ she flashed.  ‘I leave him my house and all my money;\nit is more than he deserves.  I wonder you dare speak to me about that\nman.  And besides, it is all he cares for; let him take it, and let me\nnever hear from him again.’\n\n‘I thought you romantic about fathers,’ he said.\n\n‘Is that a taunt?’ she demanded.\n\n‘No,’ he replied, ‘it is an argument.  No one can make you like him, but\ndon’t disgrace him in his own eyes.  He is old, Esther, old and broken\ndown.  Even I am sorry for him, and he has been the loss of all I cared\nfor.  Write to your aunt; when I see her answer you can leave quietly and\nnaturally, and I will take you to your aunt’s door.  But in the meantime\nyou must go home.  You have no money, and so you are helpless, and must\ndo as I tell you; and believe me, Esther, I do all for your good, and\nyour good only, so God help me.’\n\nShe had put her hand into her pocket and withdrawn it empty.\n\n‘I counted upon you,’ she wailed.\n\n‘You counted rightly then,’ he retorted.  ‘I will not, to please you for\na moment, make both of us unhappy for our lives; and since I cannot marry\nyou, we have only been too long away, and must go home at once.’\n\n‘Dick,’ she cried suddenly, ‘perhaps I might—perhaps in time—perhaps—’\n\n‘There is no perhaps about the matter,’ interrupted Dick.  ‘I must go and\nbring the phaeton.’  And with that he strode from the station, all in a\nglow of passion and virtue.  Esther, whose eyes had come alive and her\ncheeks flushed during these last words, relapsed in a second into a state\nof petrifaction.  She remained without motion during his absence, and\nwhen he returned suffered herself to be put back into the phaeton, and\ndriven off on the return journey like an idiot or a tired child.\nCompared with what she was now, her condition of the morning seemed\npositively natural.  She sat white and cold and silent, and there was no\nspeculation in her eyes.  Poor Dick flailed and flailed at the pony, and\nonce tried to whistle, but his courage was going down; huge clouds of\ndespair gathered together in his soul, and from time to time their\ndarkness was divided by a piercing flash of longing and regret.  He had\nlost his love—he had lost his love for good.\n\nThe pony was tired, and the hills very long and steep, and the air\nsultrier than ever, for now the breeze began to fail entirely.  It seemed\nas if this miserable drive would never be done, as if poor Dick would\nnever be able to go away and be comfortably wretched by himself; for all\nhis desire was to escape from her presence and the reproach of her\naverted looks.  He had lost his love, he thought—he had lost his love for\ngood.\n\nThey were already not far from the cottage, when his heart again faltered\nand he appealed to her once more, speaking low and eagerly in broken\nphrases.\n\n‘I cannot live without your love,’ he concluded.\n\n‘I do not understand what you mean,’ she replied, and I believe with\nperfect truth.\n\n‘Then,’ said he, wounded to the quick, ‘your aunt might come and fetch\nyou herself.  Of course you can command me as you please.  But I think it\nwould be better so.’\n\n‘Oh yes,’ she said wearily, ‘better so.’\n\nThis was the only exchange of words between them till about four o’clock;\nthe phaeton, mounting the lane, ‘opened out’ the cottage between the\nleafy banks.  Thin smoke went straight up from the chimney; the flowers\nin the garden, the hawthorn in the lane, hung down their heads in the\nheat; the stillness was broken only by the sound of hoofs.  For right\nbefore the gate a livery servant rode slowly up and down, leading a\nsaddle horse.  And in this last Dick shuddered to identify his father’s\nchestnut.\n\nAlas! poor Richard, what should this portend?\n\nThe servant, as in duty bound, dismounted and took the phaeton into his\nkeeping; yet Dick thought he touched his hat to him with something of a\ngrin.  Esther, passive as ever, was helped out and crossed the garden\nwith a slow and mechanical gait; and Dick, following close behind her,\nheard from within the cottage his father’s voice upraised in an anathema,\nand the shriller tones of the Admiral responding in the key of war.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—BATTLE ROYAL\n\n\nSQUIRE NASEBY, on sitting down to lunch, had inquired for Dick, whom he\nhad not seen since the day before at dinner; and the servant answering\nawkwardly that Master Richard had come back but had gone out again with\nthe pony phaeton, his suspicions became aroused, and he cross-questioned\nthe man until the whole was out.  It appeared from this report that Dick\nhad been going about for nearly a month with a girl in the Vale—a Miss\nVan Tromp; that she lived near Lord Trevanion’s upper wood; that recently\nMiss Van Tromp’s papa had returned home from foreign parts after a\nprolonged absence; that this papa was an old gentleman, very chatty and\nfree with his money in the public-house—whereupon Mr. Naseby’s face\nbecame encrimsoned; that the papa, furthermore, was said to be an\nadmiral—whereupon Mr. Naseby spat out a whistle brief and fierce as an\noath; that Master Dick seemed very friendly with the papa—‘God help him!’\nsaid Mr. Naseby; that last night Master Dick had not come in, and to-day\nhe had driven away in the phaeton with the young lady—\n\n‘Young woman,’ corrected Mr. Naseby.\n\n‘Yes, sir,’ said the man, who had been unwilling enough to gossip from\nthe first, and was now cowed by the effect of his communications on the\nmaster.  ‘Young woman, sir!’\n\n‘Had they luggage?’ demanded the Squire.\n\n‘Yes, sir.’\n\nMr. Naseby was silent for a moment, struggling to keep down his emotion,\nand he mastered it so far as to mount into the sarcastic vein, when he\nwas in the nearest danger of melting into the sorrowful.\n\n‘And was this—this Van Dunk with them?’ he asked, dwelling scornfully\nupon the name.\n\nThe servant believed not, and being eager to shift the responsibility of\nspeech to other shoulders, suggested that perhaps the master had better\ninquire further from George the stableman in person.\n\n‘Tell him to saddle the chestnut and come with me.  He can take the gray\ngelding; for we may ride fast.  And then you can take away this trash,’\nadded Mr. Naseby, pointing to the luncheon; and he arose, lordly in his\nanger, and marched forth upon the terrace to await his horse.\n\nThere Dick’s old nurse shrunk up to him, for the news went like wildfire\nover Naseby House, and timidly expressed a hope that there was nothing\nmuch amiss with the young master.\n\n‘I’ll pull him through,’ the Squire said grimly, as though he meant to\npull him through a threshing-mill; ‘I’ll save him from this gang; God\nhelp him with the next!  He has a taste for low company, and no natural\naffections to steady him.  His father was no society for him; he must go\nfuddling with a Dutchman, Nance, and now he’s caught.  Let us pray he’ll\ntake the lesson,’ he added more gravely, ‘but youth is here to make\ntroubles, and age to pull them out again.’\n\nNance whimpered and recalled several episodes of Dick’s childhood, which\nmoved Mr. Naseby to blow his nose and shake her hard by the hand; and\nthen, the horse arriving opportunely, to get himself without delay into\nthe saddle and canter off.\n\nHe rode straight, hot spur, to Thymebury, where, as was to be expected,\nhe could glean no tidings of the runaways.  They had not been seen at the\nGeorge; they had not been seen at the station.  The shadow darkened on\nMr. Naseby’s face; the junction did not occur to him; his last hope was\nfor Van Tromp’s cottage; thither he bade George guide him, and thither he\nfollowed, nursing grief, anxiety, and indignation in his heart.\n\n‘Here it is, sir,’ said George stopping.\n\n‘What! on my own land!’ he cried.  ‘How’s this?  I let this place to\nsomebody—M‘Whirter or M‘Glashan.’\n\n‘Miss M‘Glashan was the young lady’s aunt, sir, I believe,’ returned\nGeorge.\n\n‘Ay—dummies,’ said the Squire.  ‘I shall whistle for my rent too.  Here,\ntake my horse.’\n\nThe Admiral, this hot afternoon, was sitting by the window with a long\nglass.  He already knew the Squire by sight, and now, seeing him dismount\nbefore the cottage and come striding through the garden, concluded\nwithout doubt he was there to ask for Esther’s hand.\n\n‘This is why the girl is not yet home,’ he thought: ‘a very suitable\ndelicacy on young Naseby’s part.’\n\nAnd he composed himself with some pomp, answered the loud rattle of the\nriding-whip upon the door with a dulcet invitation to enter, and coming\nforward with a bow and a smile, ‘Mr. Naseby, I believe,’ said he.\n\nThe Squire came armed for battle; took in his man from top to toe in one\nrapid and scornful glance, and decided on a course at once.  He must let\nthe fellow see that he understood him.\n\n‘You are Mr. Van Tromp?’ he returned roughly, and without taking any\nnotice of the proffered hand.\n\n‘The same, sir,’ replied the Admiral.  ‘Pray be seated.’\n\n‘No sir,’ said the Squire, point-blank, ‘I will not be seated.  I am told\nthat you are an admiral,’ he added.\n\n‘No sir, I am not an admiral,’ returned Van Tromp, who now began to grow\nnettled and enter into the spirit of the interview.\n\n‘Then why do you call yourself one, sir?’\n\n‘I have to ask your pardon, I do not,’ says Van Tromp, as grand as the\nPope.\n\nBut nothing was of avail against the Squire.\n\n‘You sail under false colours from beginning to end,’ he said.  ‘Your\nvery house was taken under a sham name.’\n\n‘It is not my house.  I am my daughter’s guest,’ replied the Admiral.\n‘If it _were_ my house—’\n\n‘Well?’ said the Squire, ‘what then? hey?’\n\nThe Admiral looked at him nobly, but was silent.\n\n‘Look here,’ said Mr. Naseby, ‘this intimidation is a waste of time; it\nis thrown away on me, sir; it will not succeed with me.  I will not\npermit you even to gain time by your fencing.  Now, sir, I presume you\nunderstand what brings me here.’\n\n‘I am entirely at a loss to account for your intrusion,’ bows and waves\nVan Tromp.\n\n‘I will try to tell you then.  I come here as a father’—down came the\nriding-whip upon the table—‘I have right and justice upon my side.  I\nunderstand your calculations, but you calculated without me.  I am a man\nof the world, and I see through you and your manœuvres.  I am dealing now\nwith a conspiracy—I stigmatise it as such, and I will expose it and crush\nit.  And now I order you to tell me how far things have gone, and whither\nyou have smuggled my unhappy son.’\n\n‘My God, sir!’ Van Tromp broke out, ‘I have had about enough of this.\nYour son?  God knows where he is for me!  What the devil have I to do\nwith your son?  My daughter is out, for the matter of that; I might ask\nyou where she was, and what would you say to that?  But this is all\nmidsummer madness.  Name your business distinctly, and be off.’\n\n‘How often am I to tell you?’ cried the Squire.  ‘Where did your daughter\ntake my son to-day in that cursed pony carriage?’\n\n‘In a pony carriage?’ repeated Van Tromp.\n\n‘Yes, sir—with luggage.’\n\n‘Luggage?’—Van Tromp had turned a little pale.\n\n‘Luggage, I said—luggage!’ shouted Naseby.  ‘You may spare me this\ndissimulation.  Where’s my son.  You are speaking to a father, sir, a\nfather.’\n\n‘But, sir, if this be true,’ out came Van Tromp in a new key, ‘it is I\nwho have an explanation to demand?’\n\n‘Precisely.  There is the conspiracy,’ retorted Naseby.  ‘Oh!’ he added,\n‘I am a man of the world.  I can see through and through you.’\n\nVan Tromp began to understand.\n\n‘You speak a great deal about being a father, Mr. Naseby,’ said he; ‘I\nbelieve you forget that the appellation is common to both of us.  I am at\na loss to figure to myself, however dimly, how any man—I have not said\nany gentleman—could so brazenly insult another as you have been insulting\nme since you entered this house.  For the first time I appreciate your\nbase insinuations, and I despise them and you.  You were, I am told, a\nmanufacturer; I am an artist; I have seen better days; I have moved in\nsocieties where you would not be received, and dined where you would be\nglad to pay a pound to see me dining.  The so-called aristocracy of\nwealth, sir, I despise.  I refuse to help you; I refuse to be helped by\nyou.  There lies the door.’\n\nAnd the Admiral stood forth in a halo.\n\nIt was then that Dick entered.  He had been waiting in the porch for some\ntime back, and Esther had been listlessly standing by his side.  He had\nput out his hand to bar her entrance, and she had submitted without\nsurprise; and though she seemed to listen, she scarcely appeared to\ncomprehend.  Dick, on his part, was as white as a sheet; his eyes burned\nand his lips trembled with anger as he thrust the door suddenly open,\nintroduced Esther with ceremonious gallantry, and stood forward and\nknocked his hat firmer on his head like a man about to leap.\n\n‘What is all this?’ he demanded.\n\n‘Is this your father, Mr. Naseby?’ inquired the Admiral.\n\n‘It is,’ said the young man.\n\n‘I make you my compliments,’ returned Van Tromp.\n\n‘Dick!’ cried his father, suddenly breaking forth, ‘it is not too late,\nis it?  I have come here in time to save you.  Come, come away with\nme—come away from this place.’\n\nAnd he fawned upon Dick with his hands.\n\n‘Keep your hands off me,’ cried Dick, not meaning unkindness, but because\nhis nerves were shattered by so many successive miseries.\n\n‘No, no,’ said the old man, ‘don’t repulse your father, Dick, when he has\ncome here to save you.  Don’t repulse me, my boy.  Perhaps I have not\nbeen kind to you, not quite considerate, too harsh; my boy, it was not\nfor want of love.  Think of old times.  I was kind to you then, was I\nnot?  When you were a child, and your mother was with us.’  Mr. Naseby\nwas interrupted by a sort of sob.  Dick stood looking at him in a maze.\n‘Come away,’ pursued the father in a whisper; ‘you need not be afraid of\nany consequences.  I am a man of the world, Dick; and she can have no\nclaim on you—no claim, I tell you; and we’ll be handsome too, Dick—we’ll\ngive them a good round figure, father and daughter, and there’s an end.’\n\nHe had been trying to get Dick towards the door, but the latter stood\noff.\n\n‘You had better take care, sir, how you insult that lady,’ said the son,\nas black as night.\n\n‘You would not choose between your father and your mistress?’ said the\nfather.\n\n‘What do you call her, sir?’ cried Dick, high and clear.\n\nForbearance and patience were not among Mr. Naseby’s qualities.\n\n‘I called her your mistress,’ he shouted, ‘and I might have called her\na—’\n\n‘That is an unmanly lie,’ replied Dick, slowly.\n\n‘Dick!’ cried the father, ‘Dick!’\n\n‘I do not care,’ said the son, strengthening himself against his own\nheart; ‘I—I have said it, and it is the truth.’\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n‘Dick,’ said the old man at last, in a voice that was shaken as by a gale\nof wind, ‘I am going.  I leave you with your friends, sir—with your\nfriends.  I came to serve you, and now I go away a broken man.  For years\nI have seen this coming, and now it has come.  You never loved me.  Now\nyou have been the death of me.  You may boast of that.  Now I leave you.\nGod pardon you.’\n\nWith that he was gone; and the three who remained together heard his\nhorse’s hoofs descend the lane.  Esther had not made a sign throughout\nthe interview, and still kept silence now that it was over; but the\nAdmiral, who had once or twice moved forward and drawn back again, now\nadvanced for good.\n\n‘You are a man of spirit, sir,’ said he to Dick; ‘but though I am no\nfriend to parental interference, I will say that you were heavy on the\ngovernor.’  Then he added with a chuckle: ‘You began, Richard, with a\nsilver spoon, and here you are in the water like the rest.  Work, work,\nnothing like work.  You have parts, you have manners; why, with\napplication you may die a millionaire!’  Dick shook himself.  He took\nEsther by the hand, looking at her mournfully.\n\n‘Then this is farewell,’ he said.\n\n‘Yes,’ she answered.  There was no tone in her voice, and she did not\nreturn his gaze.\n\n‘For ever,’ added Dick.\n\n‘For ever,’ she repeated mechanically.\n\n‘I have had hard measure,’ he continued.  ‘In time I believe I could have\nshown you I was worthy, and there was no time long enough to show how\nmuch I loved you.  But it was not to be.  I have lost all.’\n\nHe relinquished her hand, still looking at her, and she turned to leave\nthe room.\n\n‘Why, what in fortune’s name is the meaning of all this?’ cried Van\nTromp.  ‘Esther come back!’\n\n‘Let her go,’ said Dick, and he watched her disappear with strangely\nmingled feelings.  For he had fallen into that stage when men have the\nvertigo of misfortune, court the strokes of destiny, and rush towards\nanything decisive, that it may free them from suspense though at the cost\nof ruin.  It is one of the many minor forms of suicide.\n\n‘She did not love me,’ he said, turning to her father.\n\n‘I feared as much,’ said he, ‘when I sounded her.  Poor Dick, poor Dick.\nAnd yet I believe I am as much cut up as you are.  I was born to see\nothers happy.’\n\n‘You forget,’ returned Dick, with something like a sneer, ‘that I am now\na pauper.’\n\nVan Tromp snapped his fingers.\n\n‘Tut!’ said he; ‘Esther has plenty for us all.’\n\nDick looked at him with some wonder.  It had never dawned upon him that\nthis shiftless, thriftless, worthless, sponging parasite was yet, after\nand in spite of all, not mercenary in the issue of his thoughts; yet so\nit was.\n\n‘Now,’ said Dick, ‘I must go.’\n\n‘Go?’ cried Van Tromp.  ‘Where?  Not one foot, Mr. Richard Naseby.  Here\nyou shall stay in the meantime! and—well, and do something\npractical—advertise for a situation as private secretary—and when you\nhave it, go and welcome.  But in the meantime, sir, no false pride; we\nmust stay with our friends; we must sponge a while on Papa Van Tromp, who\nhas sponged so often upon us.’\n\n‘By God,’ cried Dick, ‘I believe you are the best of the lot.’\n\n‘Dick, my boy,’ replied the Admiral, winking, ‘you mark me, I am not the\nworst.’\n\n‘Then why,’ began Dick, and then paused.  ‘But Esther,’ he began again,\nonce more to interrupt himself.  ‘The fact is, Admiral,’ he came out with\nit roundly now, ‘your daughter wished to run away from you to-day, and I\nonly brought her back with difficulty.’\n\n‘In the pony carriage?’ asked the Admiral, with the silliness of extreme\nsurprise.\n\n‘Yes,’ Dick answered.\n\n‘Why, what the devil was she running away from?’\n\nDick found the question unusually hard to answer.\n\n‘Why,’ said he, ‘you know, you’re a bit of a rip.’\n\n‘I behave to that girl, sir, like an archdeacon,’ replied Van Tromp\nwarmly.\n\n‘Well—excuse me—but you know you drink,’ insisted Dick.\n\n‘I know that I was a sheet in the wind’s eye, sir, once—once only, since\nI reached this place,’ retorted the Admiral.  ‘And even then I was fit\nfor any drawing-room.  I should like you to tell me how many fathers, lay\nand clerical, go upstairs every day with a face like a lobster and cod’s\neyes—and are dull, upon the back of it—not even mirth for the money!  No,\nif that’s what she runs for, all I say is, let her run.’\n\n‘You see,’ Dick tried it again, ‘she has fancies—’\n\n‘Confound her fancies!’ cried Van Tromp.  ‘I used her kindly; she had her\nown way; I was her father.  Besides I had taken quite a liking to the\ngirl, and meant to stay with her for good.  But I tell you what it is,\nDick, since she has trifled with you—Oh, yes, she did though!—and since\nher old papa’s not good enough for her—the devil take her, say I.’\n\n‘You will be kind to her at least?’ said Dick.\n\n‘I never was unkind to a living soul,’ replied the Admiral.  ‘Firm I can\nbe, but not unkind.’\n\n‘Well,’ said Dick, offering his hand, ‘God bless you, and farewell.’\n\nThe Admiral swore by all his gods he should not go.  ‘Dick,’ he said,\n‘You are a selfish dog; you forget your old Admiral.  You wouldn’t leave\nhim alone, would you?’\n\nIt was useless to remind him that the house was not his to dispose of,\nthat being a class of considerations to which his intelligence was\nclosed; so Dick tore himself off by force, and, shouting a good-bye, made\noff along the lane to Thymebury.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—IN WHICH THE LIBERAL EDITOR RE-APPEARS AS ‘DEUS EX MACHINA’\n\n\nIT was perhaps a week later, as old Mr. Naseby sat brooding in his study,\nthat there was shown in upon him, on urgent business, a little hectic\ngentleman shabbily attired.\n\n‘I have to ask pardon for this intrusion, Mr. Naseby,’ he said; ‘but I\ncome here to perform a duty.  My card has been sent in, but perhaps you\nmay not know, what it does not tell you, that I am the editor of the\n_Thymebury Star_.’\n\nMr. Naseby looked up, indignant.\n\n‘I cannot fancy,’ he said, ‘that we have much in common to discuss.’\n\n‘I have only a word to say—one piece of information to communicate.  Some\nmonths ago, we had—you will pardon my referring to it, it is absolutely\nnecessary—but we had an unfortunate difference as to facts.’\n\n‘Have you come to apologise?’ asked the Squire, sternly.\n\n‘No, sir; to mention a circumstance.  On the morning in question, your\nson, Mr. Richard Naseby—’\n\n‘I do not permit his name to be mentioned.’\n\n‘You will, however, permit me,’ replied the Editor.\n\n‘You are cruel,’ said the Squire.  He was right, he was a broken man.\n\nThen the Editor described Dick’s warning visit; and how he had seen in\nthe lad’s eye that there was a thrashing in the wind, and had escaped\nthrough pity only—so the Editor put it—‘through pity only sir.  And oh,\nsir,’ he went on, ‘if you had seen him speaking up for you, I am sure you\nwould have been proud of your son.  I know I admired the lad myself, and\nindeed that’s what brings me here.’\n\n‘I have misjudged him,’ said the Squire.  ‘Do you know where he is?’\n\n‘Yes, sir, he lies sick at Thymebury.’\n\n‘You can take me to him?’\n\n‘I can.’\n\n‘I pray God he may forgive me,’ said the father.\n\nAnd he and the Editor made post-haste for the country town.\n\nNext day the report went abroad that Mr. Richard was reconciled to his\nfather and had been taken home to Naseby House.  He was still ailing, it\nwas said, and the Squire nursed him like the proverbial woman.  Rumour,\nin this instance, did no more than justice to the truth; and over the\nsickbed many confidences were exchanged, and clouds that had been growing\nfor years passed away in a few hours, and as fond mankind loves to hope,\nfor ever.  Many long talks had been fruitless in external action, though\nfruitful for the understanding of the pair; but at last, one showery\nTuesday, the Squire might have been observed upon his way to the cottage\nin the lane.\n\nThe old gentleman had arranged his features with a view to self-command,\nrather than external cheerfulness; and he entered the cottage on his\nvisit of conciliation with the bearing of a clergyman come to announce a\ndeath.\n\nThe Admiral and his daughter were both within, and both looked upon their\nvisitor with more surprise than favour.\n\n‘Sir,’ said he to Van Tromp, ‘I am told I have done you much injustice.’\n\nThere came a little sound in Esther’s throat, and she put her hand\nsuddenly to her heart.\n\n‘You have, sir; and the acknowledgment suffices,’ replied the Admiral.\n‘I am prepared, sir, to be easy with you, since I hear you have made it\nup with my friend Dick.  But let me remind you that you owe some\napologies to this young lady also.’\n\n‘I shall have the temerity to ask for more than her forgiveness,’ said\nthe Squire.  ‘Miss Van Tromp,’ he continued, ‘once I was in great\ndistress, and knew nothing of you or your character; but I believe you\nwill pardon a few rough words to an old man who asks forgiveness from his\nheart.  I have heard much of you since then; for you have a fervent\nadvocate in my house.  I believe you will understand that I speak of my\nson.  He is, I regret to say, very far from well; he does not pick up as\nthe doctors had expected; he has a great deal upon his mind, and, to tell\nyou the truth, my girl, if you won’t help us, I am afraid I shall lose\nhim.  Come now, forgive him!  I was angry with him once myself, and I\nfound I was in the wrong.  This is only a misunderstanding, like the\nother, believe me; and with one kind movement, you may give happiness to\nhim, and to me, and to yourself.’\n\nEsther made a movement towards the door, but long before she reached it\nshe had broken forth sobbing.\n\n‘It is all right,’ said the Admiral; ‘I understand the sex.  Let me make\nyou my compliments, Mr. Naseby.’\n\nThe Squire was too much relieved to be angry.\n\n‘My dear,’ said he to Esther, ‘you must not agitate yourself.’\n\n‘She had better go up and see him right away,’ suggested Van Tromp.\n\n‘I had not ventured to propose it,’ replied the Squire.  ‘_Les\nconvenances_, I believe—’\n\n‘_Je m’en fiche_,’ cried the Admiral, snapping his fingers.  ‘She shall\ngo and see my friend Dick.  Run and get ready, Esther.’\n\nEsther obeyed.\n\n‘She has not—has not run away again?’ inquired Mr. Naseby, as soon as she\nwas gone.\n\n‘No,’ said Van Tromp, ‘not again.  She is a devilish odd girl though,\nmind you that.’\n\n‘But I cannot stomach the man with the carbuncles,’ thought the Squire.\n\nAnd this is why there is a new household and a brand-new baby in Naseby\nDower House; and why the great Van Tromp lives in pleasant style upon the\nshores of England; and why twenty-six individual copies of the _Thymebury\nStar_ are received daily at the door of Naseby House.",
