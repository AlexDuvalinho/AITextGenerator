 "text": "BEYOND THE CITY\n\nBy Arthur Conan Doyle\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. THE NEW-COMERS.\n\n\n\"If you please, mum,\" said the voice of a domestic from somewhere round\nthe angle of the door, \"number three is moving in.\"\n\nTwo little old ladies, who were sitting at either side of a table,\nsprang to their feet with ejaculations of interest, and rushed to the\nwindow of the sitting-room.\n\n\"Take care, Monica dear,\" said one, shrouding herself in the lace\ncurtain; \"don't let them see us.\n\n\"No, no, Bertha. We must not give them reason to say that their\nneighbors are inquisitive. But I think that we are safe if we stand like\nthis.\"\n\nThe open window looked out upon a sloping lawn, well trimmed and\npleasant, with fuzzy rosebushes and a star-shaped bed of sweet-william.\nIt was bounded by a low wooden fence, which screened it off from a\nbroad, modern, new metaled road. At the other side of this road were\nthree large detached deep-bodied villas with peaky eaves and small\nwooden balconies, each standing in its own little square of grass and\nof flowers. All three were equally new, but numbers one and two were\ncurtained and sedate, with a human, sociable look to them; while number\nthree, with yawning door and unkempt garden, had apparently only just\nreceived its furniture and made itself ready for its occupants. A\nfour-wheeler had driven up to the gate, and it was at this that the old\nladies, peeping out bird-like from behind their curtains, directed an\neager and questioning gaze.\n\nThe cabman had descended, and the passengers within were handing out\nthe articles which they desired him to carry up to the house. He stood\nred-faced and blinking, with his crooked arms outstretched, while a male\nhand, protruding from the window, kept piling up upon him a series\nof articles the sight of which filled the curious old ladies with\nbewilderment.\n\n\"My goodness me!\" cried Monica, the smaller, the drier, and the more\nwizened of the pair. \"What do you call that, Bertha? It looks to me like\nfour batter puddings.\"\n\n\"Those are what young men box each other with,\" said Bertha, with a\nconscious air of superior worldly knowledge.\n\n\"And those?\"\n\nTwo great bottle-shaped pieces of yellow shining wood had been heaped\nupon the cabman.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know what those are,\" confessed Bertha. Indian clubs had\nnever before obtruded themselves upon her peaceful and very feminine\nexistence.\n\nThese mysterious articles were followed, however, by others which were\nmore within their range of comprehension--by a pair of dumb-bells, a\npurple cricket-bag, a set of golf clubs, and a tennis racket. Finally,\nwhen the cabman, all top-heavy and bristling, had staggered off up the\ngarden path, there emerged in a very leisurely way from the cab a big,\npowerfully built young man, with a bull pup under one arm and a pink\nsporting paper in his hand. The paper he crammed into the pocket of his\nlight yellow dust-coat, and extended his hand as if to assist some one\nelse from the vehicle. To the surprise of the two old ladies, however,\nthe only thing which his open palm received was a violent slap, and\na tall lady bounded unassisted out of the cab. With a regal wave she\nmotioned the young man towards the door, and then with one hand upon her\nhip she stood in a careless, lounging attitude by the gate, kicking her\ntoe against the wall and listlessly awaiting the return of the driver.\n\nAs she turned slowly round, and the sunshine struck upon her face, the\ntwo watchers were amazed to see that this very active and energetic lady\nwas far from being in her first youth, so far that she had certainly\ncome of age again since she first passed that landmark in life's\njourney. Her finely chiseled, clean-cut face, with something red Indian\nabout the firm mouth and strongly marked cheek bones, showed even at\nthat distance traces of the friction of the passing years. And yet she\nwas very handsome. Her features were as firm in repose as those of a\nGreek bust, and her great dark eyes were arched over by two brows so\nblack, so thick, and so delicately curved, that the eye turned away from\nthe harsher details of the face to marvel at their grace and strength.\nHer figure, too, was straight as a dart, a little portly, perhaps, but\ncurving into magnificent outlines, which were half accentuated by the\nstrange costume which she wore. Her hair, black but plentifully shot\nwith grey, was brushed plainly back from her high forehead, and was\ngathered under a small round felt hat, like that of a man, with\none sprig of feather in the band as a concession to her sex. A\ndouble-breasted jacket of some dark frieze-like material fitted closely\nto her figure, while her straight blue skirt, untrimmed and ungathered,\nwas cut so short that the lower curve of her finely-turned legs was\nplainly visible beneath it, terminating in a pair of broad, flat,\nlow-heeled and square-toed shoes. Such was the lady who lounged at\nthe gate of number three, under the curious eyes of her two opposite\nneighbors.\n\nBut if her conduct and appearance had already somewhat jarred upon their\nlimited and precise sense of the fitness of things, what were they to\nthink of the next little act in this tableau vivant? The cabman, red and\nheavy-jowled, had come back from his labors, and held out his hand for\nhis fare. The lady passed him a coin, there was a moment of mumbling\nand gesticulating, and suddenly she had him with both hands by the red\ncravat which girt his neck, and was shaking him as a terrier would\na rat. Right across the pavement she thrust him, and, pushing him up\nagainst the wheel, she banged his head three several times against the\nside of his own vehicle.\n\n\"Can I be of any use to you, aunt?\" asked the large youth, framing\nhimself in the open doorway.\n\n\"Not the slightest,\" panted the enraged lady. \"There, you low\nblackguard, that will teach you to be impertinent to a lady.\"\n\nThe cabman looked helplessly about him with a bewildered, questioning\ngaze, as one to whom alone of all men this unheard-of and extraordinary\nthing had happened. Then, rubbing his head, he mounted slowly on to the\nbox and drove away with an uptossed hand appealing to the universe. The\nlady smoothed down her dress, pushed back her hair under her little felt\nhat, and strode in through the hall-door, which was closed behind her.\nAs with a whisk her short skirts vanished into the darkness, the two\nspectators--Miss Bertha and Miss Monica Williams--sat looking at each\nother in speechless amazement. For fifty years they had peeped through\nthat little window and across that trim garden, but never yet had such a\nsight as this come to confound them.\n\n\"I wish,\" said Monica at last, \"that we had kept the field.\"\n\n\"I am sure I wish we had,\" answered her sister.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. BREAKING THE ICE.\n\n\nThe cottage from the window of which the Misses Williams had looked\nout stands, and has stood for many a year, in that pleasant suburban\ndistrict which lies between Norwood, Anerley, and Forest Hill. Long\nbefore there had been a thought of a township there, when the Metropolis\nwas still quite a distant thing, old Mr. Williams had inhabited \"The\nBrambles,\" as the little house was called, and had owned all the\nfields about it. Six or eight such cottages scattered over a rolling\ncountry-side were all the houses to be found there in the days when the\ncentury was young. From afar, when the breeze came from the north, the\ndull, low roar of the great city might be heard, like the breaking of\nthe tide of life, while along the horizon might be seen the dim curtain\nof smoke, the grim spray which that tide threw up. Gradually, however,\nas the years passed, the City had thrown out a long brick-feeler here\nand there, curving, extending, and coalescing, until at last the little\ncottages had been gripped round by these red tentacles, and had been\nabsorbed to make room for the modern villa. Field by field the estate of\nold Mr. Williams had been sold to the speculative builder, and had borne\nrich crops of snug suburban dwellings, arranged in curving crescents and\ntree-lined avenues. The father had passed away before his cottage was\nentirely bricked round, but his two daughters, to whom the property had\ndescended, lived to see the last vestige of country taken from them. For\nyears they had clung to the one field which faced their windows, and it\nwas only after much argument and many heartburnings, that they had at\nlast consented that it should share the fate of the others. A broad road\nwas driven through their quiet domain, the quarter was re-named \"The\nWilderness,\" and three square, staring, uncompromising villas began to\nsprout up on the other side. With sore hearts, the two shy little old\nmaids watched their steady progress, and speculated as to what fashion\nof neighbors chance would bring into the little nook which had always\nbeen their own.\n\nAnd at last they were all three finished. Wooden balconies and\noverhanging eaves had been added to them, so that, in the language of\nthe advertisement, there were vacant three eligible Swiss-built villas,\nwith sixteen rooms, no basement, electric bells, hot and cold water, and\nevery modern convenience, including a common tennis lawn, to be let\nat L100 a year, or L1,500 purchase. So tempting an offer did not long\nremain open. Within a few weeks the card had vanished from number one,\nand it was known that Admiral Hay Denver, V. C., C. B., with Mrs. Hay\nDenver and their only son, were about to move into it. The news brought\npeace to the hearts of the Williams sisters. They had lived with a\nsettled conviction that some wild impossible colony, some shouting,\nsinging family of madcaps, would break in upon their peace. This\nestablishment at least was irreproachable. A reference to \"Men of the\nTime\" showed them that Admiral Hay Denver was a most distinguished\nofficer, who had begun his active career at Bomarsund, and had ended it\nat Alexandria, having managed between these two episodes to see as much\nservice as any man of his years. From the Taku Forts and the _Shannon_\nbrigade, to dhow-harrying off Zanzibar, there was no variety of naval\nwork which did not appear in his record; while the Victoria Cross, and\nthe Albert Medal for saving life, vouched for it that in peace as in war\nhis courage was still of the same true temper. Clearly a very eligible\nneighbor this, the more so as they had been confidentially assured by\nthe estate agent that Mr. Harold Denver, the son, was a most quiet\nyoung gentleman, and that he was busy from morning to night on the Stock\nExchange.\n\nThe Hay Denvers had hardly moved in before number two also struck\nits placard, and again the ladies found that they had no reason to be\ndiscontented with their neighbors. Doctor Balthazar Walker was a very\nwell-known name in the medical world. Did not his qualifications, his\nmembership, and the record of his writings fill a long half-column\nin the \"Medical Directory,\" from his first little paper on the \"Gouty\nDiathesis\" in 1859 to his exhaustive treatise upon \"Affections of the\nVaso-Motor System\" in 1884? A successful medical career which promised\nto end in a presidentship of a college and a baronetcy, had been cut\nshort by his sudden inheritance of a considerable sum from a grateful\npatient, which had rendered him independent for life, and had enabled\nhim to turn his attention to the more scientific part of his profession,\nwhich had always had a greater charm for him than its more practical\nand commercial aspect. To this end he had given up his house in Weymouth\nStreet, and had taken this opportunity of moving himself, his scientific\ninstruments, and his two charming daughters (he had been a widower for\nsome years) into the more peaceful atmosphere of Norwood.\n\nThere was thus but one villa unoccupied, and it was no wonder that the\ntwo maiden ladies watched with a keen interest, which deepened into a\ndire apprehension, the curious incidents which heralded the coming of\nthe new tenants. They had already learned from the agent that the family\nconsisted of two only, Mrs. Westmacott, a widow, and her nephew, Charles\nWestmacott. How simple and how select it had sounded! Who could have\nforeseen from it these fearful portents which seemed to threaten\nviolence and discord among the dwellers in The Wilderness? Again the two\nold maids cried in heartfelt chorus that they wished they had not sold\ntheir field.\n\n\"Well, at least, Monica,\" remarked Bertha, as they sat over their\nteacups that afternoon, \"however strange these people may be, it is our\nduty to be as polite to them as to the others.\"\n\n\"Most certainly,\" acquiesced her sister.\n\n\"Since we have called upon Mrs. Hay Denver and upon the Misses Walker,\nwe must call upon this Mrs. Westmacott also.\"\n\n\"Certainly, dear. As long as they are living upon our land I feel as\nif they were in a sense our guests, and that it is our duty to welcome\nthem.\"\n\n\"Then we shall call to-morrow,\" said Bertha, with decision.\n\n\"Yes, dear, we shall. But, oh, I wish it was over!\"\n\nAt four o'clock on the next day, the two maiden ladies set off upon\ntheir hospitable errand. In their stiff, crackling dresses of black\nsilk, with jet-bespangled jackets, and little rows of cylindrical grey\ncurls drooping down on either side of their black bonnets, they looked\nlike two old fashion plates which had wandered off into the wrong\ndecade. Half curious and half fearful, they knocked at the door of\nnumber three, which was instantly opened by a red-headed page-boy.\n\nYes, Mrs. Westmacott was at home. He ushered them into the front room,\nfurnished as a drawing-room, where in spite of the fine spring weather a\nlarge fire was burning in the grate. The boy took their cards, and then,\nas they sat down together upon a settee, he set their nerves in a thrill\nby darting behind a curtain with a shrill cry, and prodding at something\nwith his foot. The bull pup which they had seen upon the day before\nbolted from its hiding-place, and scuttled snarling from the room.\n\n\"It wants to get at Eliza,\" said the youth, in a confidential whisper.\n\"Master says she would give him more'n he brought.\" He smiled affably\nat the two little stiff black figures, and departed in search of his\nmistress.\n\n\"What--what did he say?\" gasped Bertha.\n\n\"Something about a---- Oh, goodness gracious! Oh, help, help, help,\nhelp, help!\" The two sisters had bounded on to the settee, and stood\nthere with staring eyes and skirts gathered in, while they filled the\nwhole house with their yells. Out of a high wicker-work basket which\nstood by the fire there had risen a flat diamond-shaped head with wicked\ngreen eyes which came flickering upwards, waving gently from side to\nside, until a foot or more of glossy scaly neck was visible. Slowly the\nvicious head came floating up, while at every oscillation a fresh burst\nof shrieks came from the settee.\n\n\n\"What in the name of mischief!\" cried a voice, and there was the\nmistress of the house standing in the doorway. Her gaze at first had\nmerely taken in the fact that two strangers were standing screaming upon\nher red plush sofa. A glance at the fireplace, however, showed her the\ncause of the terror, and she burst into a hearty fit of laughter.\n\n\"Charley,\" she shouted, \"here's Eliza misbehaving again.\"\n\n\"I'll settle her,\" answered a masculine voice, and the young man dashed\ninto the room. He had a brown horse-cloth in his hand, which he\nthrew over the basket, making it fast with a piece of twine so as to\neffectually imprison its inmate, while his aunt ran across to reassure\nher visitors.\n\n\"It is only a rock snake,\" she explained.\n\n\"Oh, Bertha!\" \"Oh, Monica!\" gasped the poor exhausted gentlewomen.\n\n\"She's hatching out some eggs. That is why we have the fire. Eliza\nalways does better when she is warm. She is a sweet, gentle creature,\nbut no doubt she thought that you had designs upon her eggs. I suppose\nthat you did not touch any of them?\"\n\n\"Oh, let us get away, Bertha!\" cried Monica, with her thin, black-gloved\nhands thrown forwards in abhorrence.\n\n\"Not away, but into the next room,\" said Mrs. Westmacott, with the air\nof one whose word was law. \"This way, if you please! It is less warm\nhere.\" She led the way into a very handsomely appointed library, with\nthree great cases of books, and upon the fourth side a long yellow table\nlittered over with papers and scientific instruments. \"Sit here, and\nyou, there,\" she continued. \"That is right. Now let me see, which of you\nis Miss Williams, and which Miss Bertha Williams?\"\n\n\"I am Miss Williams,\" said Monica, still palpitating, and glancing\nfurtively about in dread of some new horror.\n\n\"And you live, as I understand, over at the pretty little cottage. It is\nvery nice of you to call so early. I don't suppose that we shall get\non, but still the intention is equally good.\" She crossed her legs and\nleaned her back against the marble mantelpiece.\n\n\"We thought that perhaps we might be of some assistance,\" said Bertha,\ntimidly. \"If there is anything which we could do to make you feel more\nat home----\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, I am too old a traveler to feel anything but at home\nwherever I go. I've just come back from a few months in the Marquesas\nIslands, where I had a very pleasant visit. That was where I got Eliza.\nIn many respects the Marquesas Islands now lead the world.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" ejaculated Miss Williams. \"In what respect?\"\n\n\"In the relation of the sexes. They have worked out the great problem\nupon their own lines, and their isolated geographical position has\nhelped them to come to a conclusion of their own. The woman there is,\nas she should be, in every way the absolute equal of the male. Come in,\nCharles, and sit down. Is Eliza all right?\"\n\n\"All right, aunt.\"\n\n\"These are our neighbors, the Misses Williams. Perhaps they will have\nsome stout. You might bring in a couple of bottles, Charles.\"\n\n\"No, no, thank you! None for us!\" cried her two visitors, earnestly.\n\n\"No? I am sorry that I have no tea to offer you. I look upon the\nsubserviency of woman as largely due to her abandoning nutritious drinks\nand invigorating exercises to the male. I do neither.\" She picked up\na pair of fifteen-pound dumb-bells from beside the fireplace and swung\nthem lightly about her head. \"You see what may be done on stout,\" said\nshe.\n\n\"But don't you think,\" the elder Miss Williams suggested timidly, \"don't\nyou think, Mrs. Westmascott, that woman has a mission of her own?\"\n\nThe lady of the house dropped her dumb-bells with a crash upon the\nfloor.\n\n\"The old cant!\" she cried. \"The old shibboleth! What is this mission\nwhich is reserved for woman? All that is humble, that is mean, that is\nsoul-killing, that is so contemptible and so ill-paid that none other\nwill touch it. All that is woman's mission. And who imposed these\nlimitations upon her? Who cooped her up within this narrow sphere? Was\nit Providence? Was it nature? No, it was the arch enemy. It was man.\"\n\n\"Oh, I say, auntie!\" drawled her nephew.\n\n\"It was man, Charles. It was you and your fellows. I say that woman is\na colossal monument to the selfishness of man. What is all this boasted\nchivalry--these fine words and vague phrases? Where is it when we wish\nto put it to the test? Man in the abstract will do anything to help a\nwoman. Of course. How does it work when his pocket is touched? Where\nis his chivalry then? Will the doctors help her to qualify? will the\nlawyers help her to be called to the bar? will the clergy tolerate her\nin the Church? Oh, it is close your ranks then and refer poor woman\nto her mission! Her mission! To be thankful for coppers and not to\ninterfere with the men while they grabble for gold, like swine round a\ntrough, that is man's reading of the mission of women. You may sit there\nand sneer, Charles, while you look upon your victim, but you know that\nit is truth, every word of it.\"\n\nTerrified as they were by this sudden torrent of words, the two\ngentlewomen could not but smile at the sight of the fiery, domineering\nvictim and the big apologetic representative of mankind who sat meekly\nbearing all the sins of his sex. The lady struck a match, whipped a\ncigarette from a case upon the mantelpiece, and began to draw the smoke\ninto her lungs.\n\n\"I find it very soothing when my nerves are at all ruffled,\" she\nexplained. \"You don't smoke? Ah, you miss one of the purest of\npleasures--one of the few pleasures which are without a reaction.\"\n\nMiss Williams smoothed out her silken lap.\n\n\"It is a pleasure,\" she said, with some approach to self-assertion,\n\"which Bertha and I are rather too old-fashioned to enjoy.\"\n\n\"No doubt. It would probably make you very ill if you attempted it.\nBy the way, I hope that you will come to some of our Guild meetings. I\nshall see that tickets are sent you.\"\n\n\"Your Guild?\"\n\n\"It is not yet formed, but I shall lose no time in forming a committee.\nIt is my habit to establish a branch of the Emancipation Guild wherever\nI go. There is a Mrs. Sanderson in Anerley who is already one of\nthe emancipated, so that I have a nucleus. It is only by organized\nresistance, Miss Williams, that we can hope to hold our own against the\nselfish sex. Must you go, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, we have one or two other visits to pay,\" said the elder sister.\n\"You will, I am sure, excuse us. I hope that you will find Norwood a\npleasant residence.\"\n\n\"All places are to me simply a battle-field,\" she answered, gripping\nfirst one and then the other with a grip which crumpled up their little\nthin fingers. \"The days for work and healthful exercise, the evenings\nto Browning and high discourse, eh, Charles? Good-bye!\" She came to the\ndoor with them, and as they glanced back they saw her still standing\nthere with the yellow bull pup cuddled up under one forearm, and the\nthin blue reek of her cigarette ascending from her lips.\n\n\"Oh, what a dreadful, dreadful woman!\" whispered sister Bertha, as they\nhurried down the street. \"Thank goodness that it is over.\"\n\n\"But she'll return the visit,\" answered the other. \"I think that we had\nbetter tell Mary that we are not at home.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. DWELLERS IN THE WILDERNESS.\n\n\nHow deeply are our destinies influenced by the most trifling causes!\nHad the unknown builder who erected and owned these new villas contented\nhimself by simply building each within its own grounds, it is probable\nthat these three small groups of people would have remained hardly\nconscious of each other's existence, and that there would have been no\nopportunity for that action and reaction which is here set forth. But\nthere was a common link to bind them together. To single himself out\nfrom all other Norwood builders the landlord had devised and laid out\na common lawn tennis ground, which stretched behind the houses\nwith taut-stretched net, green close-cropped sward, and widespread\nwhitewashed lines. Hither in search of that hard exercise which is as\nnecessary as air or food to the English temperament, came young Hay\nDenver when released from the toil of the City; hither, too, came Dr.\nWalker and his two fair daughters, Clara and Ida, and hither also,\nchampions of the lawn, came the short-skirted, muscular widow and her\nathletic nephew. Ere the summer was gone they knew each other in this\nquiet nook as they might not have done after years of a stiffer and more\nformal acquaintance.\n\nAnd especially to the Admiral and the Doctor were this closer intimacy\nand companionship of value. Each had a void in his life, as every man\nmust have who with unexhausted strength steps out of the great race, but\neach by his society might help to fill up that of his neighbor. It is\ntrue that they had not much in common, but that is sometimes an aid\nrather than a bar to friendship. Each had been an enthusiast in his\nprofession, and had retained all his interest in it. The Doctor still\nread from cover to cover his Lancet and his Medical Journal, attended\nall professional gatherings, worked himself into an alternate state of\nexaltation and depression over the results of the election of officers,\nand reserved for himself a den of his own, in which before rows of\nlittle round bottles full of glycerine, Canadian balsam, and staining\nagents, he still cut sections with a microtome, and peeped through his\nlong, brass, old-fashioned microscope at the arcana of nature. With his\ntypical face, clean shaven on lip and chin, with a firm mouth, a strong\njaw, a steady eye, and two little white fluffs of whiskers, he could\nnever be taken for anything but what he was, a high-class British\nmedical consultant of the age of fifty, or perhaps just a year or two\nolder.\n\nThe Doctor, in his hey-day, had been cool over great things, but now,\nin his retirement, he was fussy over trifles. The man who had operated\nwithout the quiver of a finger, when not only his patient's life but his\nown reputation and future were at stake, was now shaken to the soul by\na mislaid book or a careless maid. He remarked it himself, and knew the\nreason. \"When Mary was alive,\" he would say, \"she stood between me and\nthe little troubles. I could brace myself for the big ones. My girls are\nas good as girls can be, but who can know a man as his wife knows him?\"\nThen his memory would conjure up a tuft of brown hair and a single\nwhite, thin hand over a coverlet, and he would feel, as we have all\nfelt, that if we do not live and know each other after death, then\nindeed we are tricked and betrayed by all the highest hopes and subtlest\nintuitions of our nature.\n\nThe Doctor had his compensations to make up for his loss. The great\nscales of Fate had been held on a level for him; for where in all great\nLondon could one find two sweeter girls, more loving, more intelligent,\nand more sympathetic than Clara and Ida Walker? So bright were they,\nso quick, so interested in all which interested him, that if it were\npossible for a man to be compensated for the loss of a good wife then\nBalthazar Walker might claim to be so.\n\nClara was tall and thin and supple, with a graceful, womanly figure.\nThere was something stately and distinguished in her carriage, \"queenly\"\nher friends called her, while her critics described her as reserved and\ndistant.\n\nSuch as it was, however, it was part and parcel of herself, for she was,\nand had always from her childhood been, different from any one around\nher. There was nothing gregarious in her nature. She thought with her\nown mind, saw with her own eyes, acted from her own impulse. Her face\nwas pale, striking rather than pretty, but with two great dark eyes, so\nearnestly questioning, so quick in their transitions from joy to pathos,\nso swift in their comment upon every word and deed around her, that\nthose eyes alone were to many more attractive than all the beauty of her\nyounger sister. Hers was a strong, quiet soul, and it was her firm hand\nwhich had taken over the duties of her mother, had ordered the house,\nrestrained the servants, comforted her father, and upheld her weaker\nsister, from the day of that great misfortune.\n\nIda Walker was a hand's breadth smaller than Clara, but was a little\nfuller in the face and plumper in the figure. She had light yellow hair,\nmischievous blue eyes with the light of humor ever twinkling in their\ndepths, and a large, perfectly formed mouth, with that slight upward\ncurve of the corners which goes with a keen appreciation of fun,\nsuggesting even in repose that a latent smile is ever lurking at the\nedges of the lips. She was modern to the soles of her dainty little\nhigh-heeled shoes, frankly fond of dress and of pleasure, devoted to\ntennis and to comic opera, delighted with a dance, which came her way\nonly too seldom, longing ever for some new excitement, and yet behind\nall this lighter side of her character a thoroughly good, healthy-minded\nEnglish girl, the life and soul of the house, and the idol of her sister\nand her father. Such was the family at number two. A peep into the\nremaining villa and our introductions are complete.\n\nAdmiral Hay Denver did not belong to the florid, white-haired, hearty\nschool of sea-dogs which is more common in works of fiction than in the\nNavy List. On the contrary, he was the representative of a much more\ncommon type which is the antithesis of the conventional sailor. He was\na thin, hard-featured man, with an ascetic, aquiline cast of face,\ngrizzled and hollow-cheeked, clean-shaven with the exception of\nthe tiniest curved promontory of ash-colored whisker. An observer,\naccustomed to classify men, might have put him down as a canon of the\nchurch with a taste for lay costume and a country life, or as the master\nof a large public school, who joined his scholars in their outdoor\nsports. His lips were firm, his chin prominent, he had a hard, dry eye,\nand his manner was precise and formal. Forty years of stern discipline\nhad made him reserved and silent. Yet, when at his ease with an equal,\nhe could readily assume a less quarter-deck style, and he had a fund\nof little, dry stories of the world and its ways which were of interest\nfrom one who had seen so many phases of life. Dry and spare, as lean as\na jockey and as tough as whipcord, he might be seen any day swinging his\nsilver-headed Malacca cane, and pacing along the suburban roads with the\nsame measured gait with which he had been wont to tread the poop of his\nflagship. He wore a good service stripe upon his cheek, for on one\nside it was pitted and scarred where a spurt of gravel knocked up by\na round-shot had struck him thirty years before, when he served in the\nLancaster gun-battery. Yet he was hale and sound, and though he was\nfifteen years senior to his friend the Doctor, he might have passed as\nthe younger man.\n\nMrs. Hay Denver's life had been a very broken one, and her record upon\nland represented a greater amount of endurance and self-sacrifice than\nhis upon the sea. They had been together for four months after their\nmarriage, and then had come a hiatus of four years, during which he was\nflitting about between St. Helena and the Oil Rivers in a gunboat. Then\ncame a blessed year of peace and domesticity, to be followed by nine\nyears, with only a three months' break, five upon the Pacific station,\nand four on the East Indian. After that was a respite in the shape of\nfive years in the Channel squadron, with periodical runs home, and then\nagain he was off to the Mediterranean for three years and to Halifax\nfor four. Now, at last, however, this old married couple, who were still\nalmost strangers to one another, had come together in Norwood, where,\nif their short day had been chequered and broken, the evening at least\npromised to be sweet and mellow. In person Mrs. Hay Denver was tall and\nstout, with a bright, round, ruddy-cheeked face still pretty, with a\ngracious, matronly comeliness. Her whole life was a round of devotion\nand of love, which was divided between her husband and her only son,\nHarold.\n\nThis son it was who kept them in the neighborhood of London, for the\nAdmiral was as fond of ships and of salt water as ever, and was as happy\nin the sheets of a two-ton yacht as on the bridge of his sixteen-knot\nmonitor. Had he been untied, the Devonshire or Hampshire coast would\ncertainly have been his choice. There was Harold, however, and Harold's\ninterests were their chief care. Harold was four-and-twenty now.\nThree years before he had been taken in hand by an acquaintance of his\nfather's, the head of a considerable firm of stock-brokers, and fairly\nlaunched upon 'Change. His three hundred guinea entrance fee paid, his\nthree sureties of five hundred pounds each found, his name approved by\nthe Committee, and all other formalities complied with, he found himself\nwhirling round, an insignificant unit, in the vortex of the money market\nof the world. There, under the guidance of his father's friend, he was\ninstructed in the mysteries of bulling and of bearing, in the\nstrange usages of 'Change in the intricacies of carrying over and of\ntransferring. He learned to know where to place his clients' money,\nwhich of the jobbers would make a price in New Zealands, and which\nwould touch nothing but American rails, which might be trusted and which\nshunned. All this, and much more, he mastered, and to such purpose that\nhe soon began to prosper, to retain the clients who had been recommended\nto him, and to attract fresh ones. But the work was never congenial.\nHe had inherited from his father his love of the air of heaven, his\naffection for a manly and natural existence. To act as middleman between\nthe pursuer of wealth, and the wealth which he pursued, or to stand as\na human barometer, registering the rise and fall of the great mammon\npressure in the markets, was not the work for which Providence had\nplaced those broad shoulders and strong limbs upon his well knit frame.\nHis dark open face, too, with his straight Grecian nose, well opened\nbrown eyes, and round black-curled head, were all those of a man who was\nfashioned for active physical work. Meanwhile he was popular with his\nfellow brokers, respected by his clients, and beloved at home, but his\nspirit was restless within him and his mind chafed unceasingly against\nhis surroundings.\n\n\"Do you know, Willy,\" said Mrs. Hay Denver one evening as she stood\nbehind her husband's chair, with her hand upon his shoulder, \"I think\nsometimes that Harold is not quite happy.\"\n\n\"He looks happy, the young rascal,\" answered the Admiral, pointing with\nhis cigar. It was after dinner, and through the open French window of\nthe dining-room a clear view was to be had of the tennis court and the\nplayers. A set had just been finished, and young Charles Westmacott was\nhitting up the balls as high as he could send them in the middle of the\nground. Doctor Walker and Mrs. Westmacott were pacing up and down the\nlawn, the lady waving her racket as she emphasized her remarks, and\nthe Doctor listening with slanting head and little nods of agreement.\nAgainst the rails at the near end Harold was leaning in his flannels\ntalking to the two sisters, who stood listening to him with their long\ndark shadows streaming down the lawn behind them. The girls were dressed\nalike in dark skirts, with light pink tennis blouses and pink bands on\ntheir straw hats, so that as they stood with the soft red of the setting\nsun tinging their faces, Clara, demure and quiet, Ida, mischievous\nand daring, it was a group which might have pleased the eye of a more\nexacting critic than the old sailor.\n\n\"Yes, he looks happy, mother,\" he repeated, with a chuckle. \"It is not\nso long ago since it was you and I who were standing like that, and I\ndon't remember that we were very unhappy either. It was croquet in our\ntime, and the ladies had not reefed in their skirts quite so taut. What\nyear would it be? Just before the commission of the Penelope.\"\n\nMrs. Hay Denver ran her fingers through his grizzled hair. \"It was when\nyou came back in the Antelope, just before you got your step.\"\n\n\"Ah, the old Antelope! What a clipper she was! She could sail two\npoints nearer the wind than anything of her tonnage in the service. You\nremember her, mother. You saw her come into Plymouth Bay. Wasn't she a\nbeauty?\"\n\n\"She was indeed, dear. But when I say that I think that Harold is not\nhappy I mean in his daily life. Has it never struck you how thoughtful\nhe is at times, and how absent-minded?\"\n\n\"In love perhaps, the young dog. He seems to have found snug moorings\nnow at any rate.\"\n\n\"I think that it is very likely that you are right, Willy,\" answered the\nmother seriously. \"But with which of them?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell.\"\n\n\"Well, they are very charming girls, both of them. But as long as he\nhangs in the wind between the two it cannot be serious. After all, the\nboy is four-and-twenty, and he made five hundred pounds last year. He is\nbetter able to marry than I was when I was lieutenant.\"\n\n\"I think that we can see which it is now,\" remarked the observant\nmother. Charles Westmacott had ceased to knock the tennis balls about,\nand was chatting with Clara Walker, while Ida and Harold Denver\nwere still talking by the railing with little outbursts of laughter.\nPresently a fresh set was formed, and Doctor Walker, the odd man out,\ncame through the wicket gate and strolled up the garden walk.\n\n\"Good evening, Mrs. Hay Denver,\" said he, raising his broad straw hat.\n\"May I come in?\"\n\n\"Good evening, Doctor! Pray do!\"\n\n\"Try one of these,\" said the Admiral, holding out his cigar-case.\n\"They are not bad. I got them on the Mosquito Coast. I was thinking of\nsignaling to you, but you seemed so very happy out there.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Westmacott is a very clever woman,\" said the Doctor, lighting the\ncigar. \"By the way, you spoke about the Mosquito Coast just now. Did you\nsee much of the Hyla when you were out there?\"\n\n\"No such name on the list,\" answered the seaman, with decision. \"There's\nthe Hydra, a harbor defense turret-ship, but she never leaves the home\nwaters.\"\n\nThe Doctor laughed. \"We live in two separate worlds,\" said he. \"The Hyla\nis the little green tree frog, and Beale has founded some of his views\non protoplasm upon the appearances of its nerve cells. It is a subject\nin which I take an interest.\"\n\n\"There were vermin of all sorts in the woods. When I have been on river\nservice I have heard it at night like the engine-room when you are on\nthe measured mile. You can't sleep for the piping, and croaking, and\nchirping. Great Scott! what a woman that is! She was across the lawn\nin three jumps. She would have made a captain of the foretop in the old\ndays.\"\n\n\"She is a very remarkable woman.\"\n\n\"A very cranky one.\"\n\n\"A very sensible one in some things,\" remarked Mrs. Hay Denver.\n\n\"Look at that now!\" cried the Admiral, with a lunge of his forefinger at\nthe Doctor. \"You mark my words, Walker, if we don't look out that woman\nwill raise a mutiny with her preaching. Here's my wife disaffected\nalready, and your girls will be no better. We must combine, man, or\nthere's an end of all discipline.\"\n\n\"No doubt she is a little excessive in her views,\" said the Doctor, \"but\nin the main I think as she does.\"\n\n\"Bravo, Doctor!\" cried the lady.\n\n\"What, turned traitor to your sex! We'll court-martial you as a\ndeserter.\"\n\n\"She is quite right. The professions are not sufficiently open to women.\nThey are still far too much circumscribed in their employments. They\nare a feeble folk, the women who have to work for their bread--poor,\nunorganized, timid, taking as a favor what they might demand as a right.\nThat is why their case is not more constantly before the public, for if\ntheir cry for redress was as great as their grievance it would fill the\nworld to the exclusion of all others. It is all very well for us to be\ncourteous to the rich, the refined, those to whom life is already made\neasy. It is a mere form, a trick of manner. If we are truly courteous,\nwe shall stoop to lift up struggling womanhood when she really needs our\nhelp--when it is life and death to her whether she has it or not. And\nthen to cant about it being unwomanly to work in the higher professions.\nIt is womanly enough to starve, but unwomanly to use the brains which\nGod has given them. Is it not a monstrous contention?\"\n\nThe Admiral chuckled. \"You are like one of these phonographs, Walker,\"\nsaid he; \"you have had all this talked into you, and now you are reeling\nit off again. It's rank mutiny, every word of it, for man has his duties\nand woman has hers, but they are as separate as their natures are. I\nsuppose that we shall have a woman hoisting her pennant on the flagship\npresently, and taking command of the Channel Squadron.\"\n\n\"Well, you have a woman on the throne taking command of the whole\nnation,\" remarked his wife; \"and everybody is agreed that she does it\nbetter than any of the men.\"\n\nThe Admiral was somewhat staggered by this home-thrust. \"That's quite\nanother thing,\" said he.\n\n\"You should come to their next meeting. I am to take the chair. I have\njust promised Mrs. Westmacott that I will do so. But it has turned\nchilly, and it is time that the girls were indoors. Good night! I shall\nlook out for you after breakfast for our constitutional, Admiral.\"\n\nThe old sailor looked after his friend with a twinkle in his eyes.\n\n\"How old is he, mother?\"\n\n\"About fifty, I think.\"\n\n\"And Mrs. Westmacott?\"\n\n\"I heard that she was forty-three.\"\n\nThe Admiral rubbed his hands, and shook with amusement. \"We'll find one\nof these days that three and two make one,\" said he. \"I'll bet you a new\nbonnet on it, mother.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. A SISTER'S SECRET.\n\n\n\"Tell me, Miss Walker! You know how things should be. What would you\nsay was a good profession for a young man of twenty-six who has had no\neducation worth speaking about, and who is not very quick by nature?\"\nThe speaker was Charles Westmacott, and the time this same summer\nevening in the tennis ground, though the shadows had fallen now and the\ngame been abandoned.\n\nThe girl glanced up at him, amused and surprised.\n\n\"Do you mean yourself?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"But how could I tell?\"\n\n\"I have no one to advise me. I believe that you could do it better than\nany one. I feel confidence in your opinion.\"\n\n\"It is very flattering.\" She glanced up again at his earnest,\nquestioning face, with its Saxon eyes and drooping flaxen mustache, in\nsome doubt as to whether he might be joking. On the contrary, all his\nattention seemed to be concentrated upon her answer.\n\n\"It depends so much upon what you can do, you know. I do not know you\nsufficiently to be able to say what natural gifts you have.\" They were\nwalking slowly across the lawn in the direction of the house.\n\n\"I have none. That is to say none worth mentioning. I have no memory and\nI am very slow.\"\n\n\"But you are very strong.\"\n\n\"Oh, if that goes for anything. I can put up a hundred-pound bar till\nfurther orders; but what sort of a calling is that?\"\n\nSome little joke about being called to the bar flickered up in Miss\nWalker's mind, but her companion was in such obvious earnest that she\nstifled down her inclination to laugh.\n\n\"I can do a mile on the cinder-track in 4:50 and across-country in 5:20,\nbut how is that to help me? I might be a cricket professional, but it\nis not a very dignified position. Not that I care a straw about dignity,\nyou know, but I should not like to hurt the old lady's feelings.\"\n\n\"Your aunt's?\"\n\n\"Yes, my aunt's. My parents were killed in the Mutiny, you know, when\nI was a baby, and she has looked after me ever since. She has been very\ngood to me. I'm sorry to leave her.\"\n\n\"But why should you leave her?\" They had reached the garden gate, and\nthe girl leaned her racket upon the top of it, looking up with grave\ninterest at her big white-flanneled companion.\n\n\"It's Browning,\" said he.\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Don't tell my aunt that I said it\"--he sank his voice to a whisper--\"I\nhate Browning.\"\n\nClara Walker rippled off into such a merry peal of laughter that he\nforgot the evil things which he had suffered from the poet, and burst\nout laughing too.\n\n\"I can't make him out,\" said he. \"I try, but he is one too many. No\ndoubt it is very stupid of me; I don't deny it. But as long as I cannot\nthere is no use pretending that I can. And then of course she feels\nhurt, for she is very fond of him, and likes to read him aloud in the\nevenings. She is reading a piece now, 'Pippa Passes,' and I assure you,\nMiss Walker, that I don't even know what the title means. You must think\nme a dreadful fool.\"\n\n\"But surely he is not so incomprehensible as all that?\" she said, as an\nattempt at encouragement.\n\n\"He is very bad. There are some things, you know, which are fine. That\nride of the three Dutchmen, and Herve Riel and others, they are all\nright. But there was a piece we read last week. The first line stumped\nmy aunt, and it takes a good deal to do that, for she rides very\nstraight. 'Setebos and Setebos and Setebos.' That was the line.\"\n\n\"It sounds like a charm.\"\n\n\"No, it is a gentleman's name. Three gentlemen, I thought, at first, but\nmy aunt says one. Then he goes on, 'Thinketh he dwelleth in the light of\nthe moon.' It was a very trying piece.\"\n\nClara Walker laughed again.\n\n\"You must not think of leaving your aunt,\" she said. \"Think how lonely\nshe would be without you.\"\n\n\"Well, yes, I have thought of that. But you must remember that my aunt\nis to all intents hardly middle-aged, and a very eligible person. I\ndon't think that her dislike to mankind extends to individuals. She\nmight form new ties, and then I should be a third wheel in the coach.\nIt was all very well as long as I was only a boy, when her first husband\nwas alive.\"\n\n\"But, good gracious, you don't mean that Mrs. Westmacott is going to\nmarry again?\" gasped Clara.\n\nThe young man glanced down at her with a question in his eyes. \"Oh, it\nis only a remote possibility, you know,\" said he. \"Still, of course,\nit might happen, and I should like to know what I ought to turn my hand\nto.\"\n\n\"I wish I could help you,\" said Clara. \"But I really know very little\nabout such things. However, I could talk to my father, who knows a very\ngreat deal of the world.\"\n\n\"I wish you would. I should be so glad if you would.\"\n\n\"Then I certainly will. And now I must say good-night, Mr. Westmacott,\nfor papa will be wondering where I am.\"\n\n\"Good night, Miss Walker.\" He pulled off his flannel cap, and stalked\naway through the gathering darkness.\n\nClara had imagined that they had been the last on the lawn, but, looking\nback from the steps which led up to the French windows, she saw two dark\nfigures moving across towards the house. As they came nearer she could\ndistinguish that they were Harold Denver and her sister Ida. The\nmurmur of their voices rose up to her ears, and then the musical little\nchild-like laugh which she knew so well. \"I am so delighted,\" she heard\nher sister say. \"So pleased and proud. I had no idea of it. Your words\nwere such a surprise and a joy to me. Oh, I am so glad.\"\n\n\"Is that you, Ida?\"\n\n\"Oh, there is Clara. I must go in, Mr. Denver. Good-night!\"\n\nThere were a few whispered words, a laugh from Ida, and a \"Good-night,\nMiss Walker,\" out of the darkness. Clara took her sister's hand, and\nthey passed together through the long folding window. The Doctor had\ngone into his study, and the dining-room was empty. A single small red\nlamp upon the sideboard was reflected tenfold by the plate about it and\nthe mahogany beneath it, though its single wick cast but a feeble light\ninto the large, dimly shadowed room. Ida danced off to the big central\nlamp, but Clara put her hand upon her arm. \"I rather like this quiet\nlight,\" said she. \"Why should we not have a chat?\" She sat in the\nDoctor's large red plush chair, and her sister cuddled down upon the\nfootstool at her feet, glancing up at her elder with a smile upon her\nlips and a mischievous gleam in her eyes. There was a shade of anxiety\nin Clara's face, which cleared away as she gazed into her sister's frank\nblue eyes.\n\n\"Have you anything to tell me, dear?\" she asked.\n\nIda gave a little pout and shrug to her shoulder. \"The Solicitor-General\nthen opened the case for the prosecution,\" said she. \"You are going to\ncross-examine me, Clara, so don't deny it. I do wish you would have that\ngrey satin foulard of yours done up. With a little trimming and a new\nwhite vest it would look as good as new, and it is really very dowdy.\"\n\n\"You were quite late upon the lawn,\" said the inexorable Clara.\n\n\"Yes, I was rather. So were you. Have you anything to tell me?\" She\nbroke away into her merry musical laugh.\n\n\"I was chatting with Mr. Westmacott.\"\n\n\"And I was chatting with Mr. Denver. By the way, Clara, now tell me\ntruly, what do you think of Mr. Denver? Do you like him? Honestly now!\"\n\n\"I like him very much indeed. I think that he is one of the most\ngentlemanly, modest, manly young men that I have ever known. So now,\ndear, have you nothing to tell me?\" Clara smoothed down her sister's\ngolden hair with a motherly gesture, and stooped her face to catch the\nexpected confidence. She could wish nothing better than that Ida should\nbe the wife of Harold Denver, and from the words which she had overheard\nas they left the lawn that evening, she could not doubt that there was\nsome understanding between them.\n\nBut there came no confession from Ida. Only the same mischievous smile\nand amused gleam in her deep blue eyes.\n\n\"That grey foulard dress----\" she began.\n\n\"Oh, you little tease! Come now, I will ask you what you have just asked\nme. Do you like Harold Denver?\"\n\n\"Oh, he's a darling!\"\n\n\"Ida!\"\n\n\"Well, you asked me. That's what I think of him. And now, you dear old\ninquisitive, you will get nothing more out of me; so you must wait and\nnot be too curious. I'm going off to see what papa is doing.\" She sprang\nto her feet, threw her arms round her sister's neck, gave her a final\nsqueeze, and was gone. A chorus from Olivette, sung in her clear\ncontralto, grew fainter and fainter until it ended in the slam of a\ndistant door.\n\nBut Clara Walker still sat in the dim-lit room with her chin upon her\nhands, and her dreamy eyes looking out into the gathering gloom. It\nwas the duty of her, a maiden, to play the part of a mother--to guide\nanother in paths which her own steps had not yet trodden. Since her\nmother died not a thought had been given to herself, all was for her\nfather and her sister. In her own eyes she was herself very plain, and\nshe knew that her manner was often ungracious when she would most wish\nto be gracious. She saw her face as the glass reflected it, but she did\nnot see the changing play of expression which gave it its charm--the\ninfinite pity, the sympathy, the sweet womanliness which drew towards\nher all who were in doubt and in trouble, even as poor slow-moving\nCharles Westmacott had been drawn to her that night. She was herself,\nshe thought, outside the pale of love. But it was very different with\nIda, merry, little, quick-witted, bright-faced Ida. She was born for\nlove. It was her inheritance. But she was young and innocent. She\nmust not be allowed to venture too far without help in those dangerous\nwaters. Some understanding there was between her and Harold Denver. In\nher heart of hearts Clara, like every good woman, was a match-maker, and\nalready she had chosen Denver of all men as the one to whom she could\nmost safely confide Ida. He had talked to her more than once on the\nserious topics of life, on his aspirations, on what a man could do to\nleave the world better for his presence. She knew that he was a man of\na noble nature, high-minded and earnest. And yet she did not like this\nsecrecy, this disinclination upon the part of one so frank and honest\nas Ida to tell her what was passing. She would wait, and if she got the\nopportunity next day she would lead Harold Denver himself on to this\ntopic. It was possible that she might learn from him what her sister had\nrefused to tell her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. A NAVAL CONQUEST.\n\n\nIt was the habit of the Doctor and the Admiral to accompany each other\nupon a morning ramble between breakfast and lunch. The dwellers in those\nquiet tree-lined roads were accustomed to see the two figures, the long,\nthin, austere seaman, and the short, bustling, tweed-clad physician,\npass and repass with such regularity that a stopped clock has been reset\nby them. The Admiral took two steps to his companion's three, but the\nyounger man was the quicker, and both were equal to a good four and a\nhalf miles an hour.\n\nIt was a lovely summer day which followed the events which have been\ndescribed. The sky was of the deepest blue, with a few white, fleecy\nclouds drifting lazily across it, and the air was filled with the low\ndrone of insects or with a sudden sharper note as bee or bluefly shot\npast with its quivering, long-drawn hum, like an insect tuning-fork. As\nthe friends topped each rise which leads up to the Crystal Palace,\nthey could see the dun clouds of London stretching along the northern\nskyline, with spire or dome breaking through the low-lying haze. The\nAdmiral was in high spirits, for the morning post had brought good news\nto his son.\n\n\"It is wonderful, Walker,\" he was saying, \"positively wonderful, the way\nthat boy of mine has gone ahead during the last three years. We heard\nfrom Pearson to-day. Pearson is the senior partner, you know, and my boy\nthe junior--Pearson and Denver the firm. Cunning old dog is Pearson,\nas cute and as greedy as a Rio shark. Yet he goes off for a fortnight's\nleave, and puts my boy in full charge, with all that immense business\nin his hands, and a freehand to do what he likes with it. How's that for\nconfidence, and he only three years upon 'Change?\"\n\n\"Any one would confide in him. His face is a surety,\" said the Doctor.\n\n\"Go on, Walker!\" The Admiral dug his elbow at him. \"You know my weak\nside. Still it's truth all the same. I've been blessed with a good wife\nand a good son, and maybe I relish them the more for having been cut off\nfrom them so long. I have much to be thankful for!\"\n\n\"And so have I. The best two girls that ever stepped. There's Clara, who\nhas learned up as much medicine as would give her the L.S.A., simply\nin order that she may sympathize with me in my work. But hullo, what is\nthis coming along?\"\n\n\"All drawing and the wind astern!\" cried the Admiral. \"Fourteen knots if\nit's one. Why, by George, it is that woman!\"\n\nA rolling cloud of yellow dust had streamed round the curve of the road,\nand from the heart of it had emerged a high tandem tricycle flying along\nat a breakneck pace. In front sat Mrs. Westmacott clad in a heather\ntweed pea-jacket, a skirt which just{?} passed her knees and a pair of\nthick gaiters of the same material. She had a great bundle of red papers\nunder her arm, while Charles, who sat behind her clad in Norfolk jacket\nand knickerbockers, bore a similar roll protruding from either pocket.\nEven as they watched, the pair eased up, the lady sprang off, impaled\none of her bills upon the garden railing of an empty house, and then\njumping on to her seat again was about to hurry onwards when her nephew\ndrew her attention to the two gentlemen upon the footpath.\n\n\"Oh, now, really I didn't notice you,\" said she, taking a few turns\nof the treadle and steering the machine across to them. \"Is it not a\nbeautiful morning?\"\n\n\"Lovely,\" answered the Doctor. \"You seem to be very busy.\"\n\n\"I am very busy.\" She pointed to the colored paper which still fluttered\nfrom the railing. \"We have been pushing our propaganda, you see. Charles\nand I have been at it since seven o'clock. It is about our meeting. I\nwish it to be a great success. See!\" She smoothed out one of the bills,\nand the Doctor read his own name in great black letters across the\nbottom.\n\n\"We don't forget our chairman, you see. Everybody is coming. Those two\ndear little old maids opposite, the Williamses, held out for some time;\nbut I have their promise now. Admiral, I am sure that you wish us well.\"\n\n\"Hum! I wish you no harm, ma'am.\"\n\n\"You will come on the platform?\"\n\n\"I'll be---- No, I don't think I can do that.\"\n\n\"To our meeting, then?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am; I don't go out after dinner.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, you will come. I will call in if I may, and chat it over with\nyou when you come home. We have not breakfasted yet. Goodbye!\" There was\na whir of wheels, and the yellow cloud rolled away down the road again.\nBy some legerdemain the Admiral found that he was clutching in his right\nhand one of the obnoxious bills. He crumpled it up, and threw it into\nthe roadway.\n\n\"I'll be hanged if I go, Walker,\" said he, as he resumed his walk. \"I've\nnever been hustled into doing a thing yet, whether by woman or man.\"\n\n\"I am not a betting man,\" answered the Doctor, \"but I rather think that\nthe odds are in favor of your going.\"\n\nThe Admiral had hardly got home, and had just seated himself in his\ndining-room, when the attack upon him was renewed. He was slowly and\nlovingly unfolding the Times preparatory to the long read which led up\nto luncheon, and had even got so far as to fasten his golden pince-nez\non to his thin, high-bridged nose, when he heard a crunching of gravel,\nand, looking over the top of his paper, saw Mrs. Westmacott coming up\nthe garden walk. She was still dressed in the singular costume which\noffended the sailor's old-fashioned notions of propriety, but he could\nnot deny, as he looked at her, that she was a very fine woman. In many\nclimes he had looked upon women of all shades and ages, but never upon\na more clearcut, handsome face, nor a more erect, supple, and womanly\nfigure. He ceased to glower as he gazed upon her, and the frown smoothed\naway from his rugged brow.\n\n\"May I come in?\" said she, framing herself in the open window, with a\nbackground of green sward and blue sky. \"I feel like an invader deep in\nan enemy's country.\"\n\n\"It is a very welcome invasion, ma'am,\" said he, clearing his throat and\npulling at his high collar. \"Try this garden chair. What is there that\nI can do for you? Shall I ring and let Mrs. Denver know that you are\nhere?\"\n\n\"Pray do not trouble, Admiral. I only looked in with reference to our\nlittle chat this morning. I wish that you would give us your powerful\nsupport at our coming meeting for the improvement of the condition of\nwoman.\"\n\n\"No, ma'am, I can't do that.\" He pursed up his lips and shook his\ngrizzled head.\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"Against my principles, ma'am.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Because woman has her duties and man has his. I may be old-fashioned,\nbut that is my view. Why, what is the world coming to? I was saying to\nDr. Walker only last night that we shall have a woman wanting to command\nthe Channel Fleet next.\"\n\n\"That is one of the few professions which cannot be improved,\" said Mrs.\nWestmacott, with her sweetest smile. \"Poor woman must still look to man\nfor protection.\"\n\n\"I don't like these new-fangled ideas, ma'am. I tell you honestly that\nI don't. I like discipline, and I think every one is the better for\nit. Women have got a great deal which they had not in the days of our\nfathers. They have universities all for themselves, I am told, and there\nare women doctors, I hear. Surely they should rest contented. What more\ncan they want?\"\n\n\"You are a sailor, and sailors are always chivalrous. If you could see\nhow things really are, you would change your opinion. What are the poor\nthings to do? There are so many of them and so few things to which they\ncan turn their hands. Governesses? But there are hardly any situations.\nMusic and drawing? There is not one in fifty who has any special talent\nin that direction. Medicine? It is still surrounded with difficulties\nfor women, and it takes many years and a small fortune to qualify.\nNursing? It is hard work ill paid, and none but the strongest can stand\nit. What would you have them do then, Admiral? Sit down and starve?\"\n\n\"Tut, tut! It is not so bad as that.\"\n\n\"The pressure is terrible. Advertise for a lady companion at ten\nshillings a week, which is less than a cook's wage, and see how many\nanswers you get. There is no hope, no outlook, for these struggling\nthousands. Life is a dull, sordid struggle, leading down to a cheerless\nold age. Yet when we try to bring some little ray of hope, some\nchance, however distant, of something better, we are told by chivalrous\ngentlemen that it is against their principles to help.\"\n\nThe Admiral winced, but shook his head in dissent.\n\n\"There is banking, the law, veterinary surgery, government offices, the\ncivil service, all these at least should be thrown freely open to women,\nif they have brains enough to compete successfully for them. Then if\nwoman were unsuccessful it would be her own fault, and the majority of\nthe population of this country could no longer complain that they live\nunder a different law to the minority, and that they are held down in\npoverty and serfdom, with every road to independence sealed to them.\"\n\n\"What would you propose to do, ma'am?\"\n\n\"To set the more obvious injustices right, and so to pave the way for\na reform. Now look at that man digging in the field. I know him. He\ncan neither read nor write, he is steeped in whisky, and he has as much\nintelligence as the potatoes that he is digging. Yet the man has a vote,\ncan possibly turn the scale of an election, and may help to decide the\npolicy of this empire. Now, to take the nearest example, here am I, a\nwoman who have had some education, who have traveled, and who have seen\nand studied the institutions of many countries. I hold considerable\nproperty, and I pay more in imperial taxes than that man spends in\nwhisky, which is saying a great deal, and yet I have no more direct\ninfluence upon the disposal of the money which I pay than that fly which\ncreeps along the wall. Is that right? Is it fair?\"\n\nThe Admiral moved uneasily in his chair. \"Yours is an exceptional case,\"\nsaid he.\n\n\"But no woman has a voice. Consider that the women are a majority in the\nnation. Yet if there was a question of legislation upon which all women\nwere agreed upon one side and all the men upon the other, it would\nappear that the matter was settled unanimously when more than half the\npopulation were opposed to it. Is that right?\"\n\nAgain the Admiral wriggled. It was very awkward for the gallant seaman\nto have a handsome woman opposite to him, bombarding him with questions\nto none of which he could find an answer. \"Couldn't even get the\ntompions out of his guns,\" as he explained the matter to the Doctor that\nevening.\n\n\"Now those are really the points that we shall lay stress upon at the\nmeeting. The free and complete opening of the professions, the final\nabolition of the zenana I call it, and the franchise to all women\nwho pay Queen's taxes above a certain sum. Surely there is nothing\nunreasonable in that. Nothing which could offend your principles. We\nshall have medicine, law, and the church all rallying that night for the\nprotection of woman. Is the navy to be the one profession absent?\"\n\nThe Admiral jumped out of his chair with an evil word in his throat.\n\"There, there, ma'am,\" he cried. \"Drop it for a time. I have heard\nenough. You've turned me a point or two. I won't deny it. But let it\nstand at that. I will think it over.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Admiral. We would not hurry you in your decision. But we\nstill hope to see you on our platform.\" She rose and moved about in her\nlounging masculine fashion from one picture to another, for the walls\nwere thickly covered with reminiscences of the Admiral's voyages.\n\n\"Hullo!\" said she. \"Surely this ship would have furled all her lower\ncanvas and reefed her topsails if she found herself on a lee shore with\nthe wind on her quarter.\"\n\n\"Of course she would. The artist was never past Gravesend, I swear. It's\nthe Penelope as she was on the 14th of June, 1857, in the throat of the\nStraits of Banca, with the Island of Banca on the starboard bow, and\nSumatra on the port. He painted it from description, but of course, as\nyou very sensibly say, all was snug below and she carried storm sails\nand double-reefed topsails, for it was blowing a cyclone from the\nsou'east. I compliment you, ma'am, I do indeed!\"\n\n\"Oh, I have done a little sailoring myself--as much as a woman can\naspire to, you know. This is the Bay of Funchal. What a lovely frigate!\"\n\n\"Lovely, you say! Ah, she was lovely! That is the Andromeda. I was a\nmate aboard of her--sub-lieutenant they call it now, though I like the\nold name best.\"\n\n\"What a lovely rake her masts have, and what a curve to her bows! She\nmust have been a clipper.\"\n\nThe old sailor rubbed his hands and his eyes glistened. His old ships\nbordered close upon his wife and his son in his affections.\n\n\"I know Funchal,\" said the lady carelessly. \"A couple of years ago I had\na seven-ton cutter-rigged yacht, the Banshee, and we ran over to Madeira\nfrom Falmouth.\"\n\n\"You ma'am, in a seven-tonner?\"\n\n\"With a couple of Cornish lads for a crew. Oh, it was glorious! A\nfortnight right out in the open, with no worries, no letters, no\ncallers, no petty thoughts, nothing but the grand works of God, the\ntossing sea and the great silent sky. They talk of riding, indeed, I am\nfond of horses, too, but what is there to compare with the swoop of a\nlittle craft as she pitches down the long steep side of a wave, and then\nthe quiver and spring as she is tossed upwards again? Oh, if our souls\ncould transmigrate I'd be a seamew above all birds that fly! But I keep\nyou, Admiral. Adieu!\"\n\nThe old sailor was too transported with sympathy to say a word. He could\nonly shake her broad muscular hand. She was half-way down the garden\npath before she heard him calling her, and saw his grizzled head and\nweather-stained face looking out from behind the curtains.\n\n\"You may put me down for the platform,\" he cried, and vanished abashed\nbehind the curtain of his Times, where his wife found him at lunch time.\n\n\"I hear that you have had quite a long chat with Mrs. Westmacott,\" said\nshe.\n\n\"Yes, and I think that she is one of the most sensible women that I ever\nknew.\"\n\n\"Except on the woman's rights question, of course.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. She had a good deal to say for herself on that also.\nIn fact, mother, I have taken a platform ticket for her meeting.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. AN OLD STORY.\n\n\nBut this was not to be the only eventful conversation which Mrs.\nWestmacott held that day, nor was the Admiral the only person in the\nWilderness who was destined to find his opinions considerably\nchanged. Two neighboring families, the Winslows from Anerley, and\nthe Cumberbatches from Gipsy Hill, had been invited to tennis by Mrs.\nWestmacott, and the lawn was gay in the evening with the blazers of\nthe young men and the bright dresses of the girls. To the older people,\nsitting round in their wicker-work garden chairs, the darting, stooping,\nspringing white figures, the sweep of skirts, and twinkle of canvas\nshoes, the click of the rackets and sharp whiz of the balls, with the\ncontinual \"fifteen love--fifteen all!\" of the marker, made up a merry\nand exhilarating scene. To see their sons and daughters so flushed and\nhealthy and happy, gave them also a reflected glow, and it was hard to\nsay who had most pleasure from the game, those who played or those who\nwatched.\n\nMrs. Westmacott had just finished a set when she caught a glimpse of\nClara Walker sitting alone at the farther end of the ground. She ran\ndown the court, cleared the net to the amazement of the visitors, and\nseated herself beside her. Clara's reserved and refined nature shrank\nsomewhat from the boisterous frankness and strange manners of the\nwidow, and yet her feminine instinct told her that beneath all her\npeculiarities there lay much that was good and noble. She smiled up at\nher, therefore, and nodded a greeting.\n\n\"Why aren't you playing, then? Don't, for goodness' sake, begin to be\nlanguid and young ladyish! When you give up active sports you give up\nyouth.\"\n\n\"I have played a set, Mrs. Westmacott.\"\n\n\"That's right, my dear.\" She sat down beside her, and tapped her upon\nthe arm with her tennis racket. \"I like you, my dear, and I am going to\ncall you Clara. You are not as aggressive as I should wish, Clara, but\nstill I like you very much. Self-sacrifice is all very well, you know,\nbut we have had rather too much of it on our side, and should like to\nsee a little on the other. What do you think of my nephew Charles?\"\n\nThe question was so sudden and unexpected that Clara gave quite a jump\nin her chair. \"I--I--I hardly ever have thought of your nephew Charles.\"\n\n\"No? Oh, you must think him well over, for I want to speak to you about\nhim.\"\n\n\"To me? But why?\"\n\n\"It seemed to me most delicate. You see, Clara, the matter stands\nin this way. It is quite possible that I may soon find myself in a\ncompletely new sphere of life, which will involve fresh duties and make\nit impossible for me to keep up a household which Charles can share.\"\n\nClara stared. Did this mean that she was about to marry again? What else\ncould it point to?\n\n\"Therefore Charles must have a household of his own. That is obvious.\nNow, I don't approve of bachelor establishments. Do you?\"\n\n\"Really, Mrs. Westmacott, I have never thought of the matter.\"\n\n\"Oh, you little sly puss! Was there ever a girl who never thought of the\nmatter? I think that a young man of six-and-twenty ought to be married.\"\n\nClara felt very uncomfortable. The awful thought had come upon her\nthat this ambassadress had come to her as a proxy with a proposal of\nmarriage. But how could that be? She had not spoken more than three or\nfour times with her nephew, and knew nothing more of him than he had\ntold her on the evening before. It was impossible, then. And yet what\ncould his aunt mean by this discussion of his private affairs?\n\n\"Do you not think yourself,\" she persisted, \"that a young man of\nsix-and-twenty is better married?\"\n\n\"I should think that he is old enough to decide for himself.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. He has done so. But Charles is just a little shy, just a\nlittle slow in expressing himself. I thought that I would pave the\nway for him. Two women can arrange these things so much better. Men\nsometimes have a difficulty in making themselves clear.\"\n\n\"I really hardly follow you, Mrs. Westmacott,\" cried Clara in despair.\n\n\"He has no profession. But he has nice tastes. He reads Browning every\nnight. And he is most amazingly strong. When he was younger we used to\nput on the gloves together, but I cannot persuade him to now, for he\nsays he cannot play light enough. I should allow him five hundred, which\nshould be enough at first.\"\n\n\"My dear Mrs. Westmacott,\" cried Clara, \"I assure you that I have not\nthe least idea what it is that you are talking of.\"\n\n\"Do you think your sister Ida would have my nephew Charles?\"\n\nHer sister Ida? Quite a little thrill of relief and of pleasure ran\nthrough her at the thought. Ida and Charles Westmacott. She had never\nthought of it. And yet they had been a good deal together. They had\nplayed tennis. They had shared the tandem tricycle. Again came\nthe thrill of joy, and close at its heels the cold questionings of\nconscience. Why this joy? What was the real source of it? Was it that\ndeep down, somewhere pushed back in the black recesses of the soul,\nthere was the thought lurking that if Charles prospered in his wooing\nthen Harold Denver would still be free? How mean, how unmaidenly, how\nunsisterly the thought! She crushed it down and thrust it aside, but\nstill it would push up its wicked little head. She crimsoned with shame\nat her own baseness, as she turned once more to her companion.\n\n\"I really do not know,\" she said.\n\n\"She is not engaged?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of.\"\n\n\"You speak hesitatingly.\"\n\n\"Because I am not sure. But he may ask. She cannot but be flattered.\"\n\n\"Quite so. I tell him that it is the most practical compliment which a\nman can pay to a woman. He is a little shy, but when he sets himself\nto do it he will do it. He is very much in love with her, I assure you.\nThese little lively people always do attract the slow and heavy ones,\nwhich is nature's device for the neutralizing of bores. But they are\nall going in. I think if you will allow me that I will just take the\nopportunity to tell him that, as far as you know, there is no positive\nobstacle in the way.\"\n\n\"As far as I know,\" Clara repeated, as the widow moved away to where\nthe players were grouped round the net, or sauntering slowly towards\nthe house. She rose to follow her, but her head was in a whirl with new\nthoughts, and she sat down again. Which would be best for Ida, Harold\nor Charles? She thought it over with as much solicitude as a mother who\nplans for her only child. Harold had seemed to her to be in many ways\nthe noblest and the best young man whom she had known. If ever she was\nto love a man it would be such a man as that. But she must not think of\nherself. She had reason to believe that both these men loved her sister.\nWhich would be the best for her? But perhaps the matter was already\ndecided. She could not forget the scrap of conversation which she had\nheard the night before, nor the secret which her sister had refused to\nconfide to her. If Ida would not tell her, there was but one person who\ncould. She raised her eyes and there was Harold Denver standing before\nher.\n\n\"You were lost in your thoughts,\" said he, smiling. \"I hope that they\nwere pleasant ones.\"\n\n\"Oh, I was planning,\" said she, rising. \"It seems rather a waste of time\nas a rule, for things have a way of working themselves out just as you\nleast expect.\"\n\n\"What were you planning, then?\"\n\n\"The future.\"\n\n\"Whose?\"\n\n\"Oh, my own and Ida's.\"\n\n\"And was I included in your joint futures?\"\n\n\"I hope all our friends were included.\"\n\n\"Don't go in,\" said he, as she began to move slowly towards the house.\n\"I wanted to have a word. Let us stroll up and down the lawn. Perhaps\nyou are cold. If you are, I could bring you out a shawl.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I am not cold.\"\n\n\"I was speaking to your sister Ida last night.\" She noticed that there\nwas a slight quiver in his voice, and, glancing up at his dark, clearcut\nface, she saw that he was very grave. She felt that it was settled, that\nhe had come to ask her for her sister's hand.\n\n\"She is a charming girl,\" said he, after a pause.\n\n\"Indeed she is,\" cried Clara warmly. \"And no one who has not lived with\nher and known her intimately can tell how charming and good she is. She\nis like a sunbeam in the house.\"\n\n\"No one who was not good could be so absolutely happy as she seems to\nbe. Heaven's last gift, I think, is a mind so pure and a spirit so\nhigh that it is unable even to see what is impure and evil in the world\naround us. For as long as we can see it, how can we be truly happy?\"\n\n\"She has a deeper side also. She does not turn it to the world, and it\nis not natural that she should, for she is very young. But she thinks,\nand has aspirations of her own.\"\n\n\"You cannot admire her more than I do. Indeed, Miss Walker, I only ask\nto be brought into nearer relationship with her, and to feel that there\nis a permanent bond between us.\"\n\nIt had come at last. For a moment her heart was numbed within her, and\nthen a flood of sisterly love carried all before it. Down with that dark\nthought which would still try to raise its unhallowed head! She turned\nto Harold with sparkling eyes and words of pleasure upon her lips.\n\n\"I should wish to be near and dear to both of you,\" said he, as he took\nher hand. \"I should wish Ida to be my sister, and you my wife.\"\n\nShe said nothing. She only stood looking at him with parted lips and\ngreat, dark, questioning eyes. The lawn had vanished away, the sloping\ngardens, the brick villas, the darkening sky with half a pale moon\nbeginning to show over the chimney-tops. All was gone, and she was only\nconscious of a dark, earnest, pleading face, and of a voice, far away,\ndisconnected from herself, the voice of a man telling a woman how he\nloved her. He was unhappy, said the voice, his life was a void; there\nwas but one thing that could save him; he had come to the parting of\nthe ways, here lay happiness and honor, and all that was high and noble;\nthere lay the soul-killing round, the lonely life, the base pursuit of\nmoney, the sordid, selfish aims. He needed but the hand of the woman\nthat he loved to lead him into the better path. And how he loved her his\nlife would show. He loved her for her sweetness, for her womanliness,\nfor her strength. He had need of her. Would she not come to him? And\nthen of a sudden as she listened it came home to her that the man was\nHarold Denver, and that she was the woman, and that all God's work was\nvery beautiful--the green sward beneath her feet, the rustling leaves,\nthe long orange slashes in the western sky. She spoke; she scarce knew\nwhat the broken words were, but she saw the light of joy shine out\non his face, and her hand was still in his as they wandered amid the\ntwilight. They said no more now, but only wandered and felt each other's\npresence. All was fresh around them, familiar and yet new, tinged with\nthe beauty of their new-found happiness.\n\n\"Did you not know it before?\" he asked.\n\n\"I did not dare to think it.\"\n\n\"What a mask of ice I must wear! How could a man feel as I have done\nwithout showing it? Your sister at least knew.\"\n\n\"Ida!\"\n\n\"It was last night. She began to praise you, I said what I felt, and\nthen in an instant it was all out.\"\n\n\"But what could you--what could you see in me? Oh, I do pray that you\nmay not repent it!\" The gentle heart was ruffled amid its joy by the\nthought of its own unworthiness.\n\n\"Repent it! I feel that I am a saved man. You do not know how degrading\nthis city life is, how debasing, and yet how absorbing. Money for ever\nclinks in your ear. You can think of nothing else. From the bottom of my\nheart I hate it, and yet how can I draw back without bringing grief\nto my dear old father? There was but one way in which I could defy the\ntaint, and that was by having a home influence so pure and so high that\nit may brace me up against all that draws me down. I have felt that\ninfluence already. I know that when I am talking to you I am a better\nman. It is you who must go with me through life, or I must walk for\never alone.\"\n\n\"Oh, Harold, I am so happy!\" Still they wandered amid the darkening\nshadows, while one by one the stars peeped out in the blue black sky\nabove them. At last a chill night wind blew up from the east, and\nbrought them back to the realities of life.\n\n\"You must go in. You will be cold.\"\n\n\"My father will wonder where I am. Shall I say anything to him?\"\n\n\"If you like, my darling. Or I will in the morning. I must tell my\nmother to-night. I know how delighted she will be.\"\n\n\"I do hope so.\"\n\n\"Let me take you up the garden path. It is so dark. Your lamp is not lit\nyet. There is the window. Till to-morrow, then, dearest.\"\n\n\"Till to-morrow, Harold.\"\n\n\"My own darling!\" He stooped, and their lips met for the first time.\nThen, as she pushed open the folding windows she heard his quick, firm\nstep as it passed down the graveled path. A lamp was lit as she entered\nthe room, and there was Ida, dancing about like a mischievous little\nfairy in front of her.\n\n\"And have you anything to tell me?\" she asked, with a solemn face. Then,\nsuddenly throwing her arms round her sister's neck, \"Oh, you dear, dear\nold Clara! I am so pleased. I am so pleased.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. VENIT TANDEM FELICITAS.\n\n\nIt was just three days after the Doctor and the Admiral had\ncongratulated each other upon the closer tie which was to unite their\ntwo families, and to turn their friendship into something even dearer\nand more intimate, that Miss Ida Walker received a letter which caused\nher some surprise and considerable amusement. It was dated from next\ndoor, and was handed in by the red-headed page after breakfast.\n\n\"Dear Miss Ida,\" began this curious document, and then relapsed suddenly\ninto the third person. \"Mr. Charles Westmacott hopes that he may have\nthe extreme pleasure of a ride with Miss Ida Walker upon his tandem\ntricycle. Mr. Charles Westmacott will bring it round in half an hour.\nYou in front. Yours very truly, Charles Westmacott.\" The whole was\nwritten in a large, loose-jointed, and school-boyish hand, very thin on\nthe up strokes and thick on the down, as though care and pains had gone\nto the fashioning of it.\n\nStrange as was the form, the meaning was clear enough; so Ida hastened\nto her room, and had hardly slipped on her light grey cycling dress when\nshe saw the tandem with its large occupant at the door. He handed her up\nto her saddle with a more solemn and thoughtful face than was usual\nwith him, and a few moments later they were flying along the beautiful,\nsmooth suburban roads in the direction of Forest Hill. The great limbs\nof the athlete made the heavy machine spring and quiver with every\nstroke; while the mignon grey figure with the laughing face, and the\ngolden curls blowing from under the little pink-banded straw hat, simply\nheld firmly to her perch, and let the treadles whirl round beneath her\nfeet. Mile after mile they flew, the wind beating in her face, the trees\ndancing past in two long ranks on either side, until they had passed\nround Croydon and were approaching Norwood once more from the further\nside.\n\n\"Aren't you tired?\" she asked, glancing over her shoulder and turning\ntowards him a little pink ear, a fluffy golden curl, and one blue eye\ntwinkling from the very corner of its lid.\n\n\"Not a bit. I am just getting my swing.\"\n\n\"Isn't it wonderful to be strong? You always remind me of a\nsteamengine.\"\n\n\"Why a steamengine?\"\n\n\"Well, because it is so powerful, and reliable, and unreasoning. Well, I\ndidn't mean that last, you know, but--but--you know what I mean. What is\nthe matter with you?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because you have something on your mind. You have not laughed once.\"\n\nHe broke into a gruesome laugh. \"I am quite jolly,\" said he.\n\n\"Oh, no, you are not. And why did you write me such a dreadfully stiff\nletter?\"\n\n\"There now,\" he cried, \"I was sure it was stiff. I said it was absurdly\nstiff.\"\n\n\"Then why write it?\"\n\n\"It wasn't my own composition.\"\n\n\"Whose then? Your aunt's?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. It was a person of the name of Slattery.\"\n\n\"Goodness! Who is he?\"\n\n\"I knew it would come out, I felt that it would. You've heard of\nSlattery the author?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"He is wonderful at expressing himself. He wrote a book called 'The\nSecret Solved; or, Letter-writing Made Easy.' It gives you models of all\nsorts of letters.\"\n\nIda burst out laughing. \"So you actually copied one.\"\n\n\"It was to invite a young lady to a picnic, but I set to work and soon\ngot it changed so that it would do very well. Slattery seems never\nto have asked any one to ride a tandem. But when I had written it, it\nseemed so dreadfully stiff that I had to put a little beginning and end\nof my own, which seemed to brighten it up a good deal.\"\n\n\n\"I thought there was something funny about the beginning and end.\"\n\n\"Did you? Fancy your noticing the difference in style. How quick you\nare! I am very slow at things like that. I ought to have been a woodman,\nor game-keeper, or something. I was made on those lines. But I have\nfound something now.\"\n\n\"What is that, then?\"\n\n\"Ranching. I have a chum in Texas, and he says it is a rare life. I am\nto buy a share in his business. It is all in the open air--shooting, and\nriding, and sport. Would it--would it inconvenience you much, Ida, to\ncome out there with me?\"\n\nIda nearly fell off her perch in her amazement. The only words of which\nshe could think were \"My goodness me!\" so she said them.\n\n\"If it would not upset your plans, or change your arrangements in any\nway.\" He had slowed down and let go of the steering handle, so that the\ngreat machine crawled aimlessly about from one side of the road to the\nother. \"I know very well that I am not clever or anything of that sort,\nbut still I would do all I can to make you very happy. Don't you think\nthat in time you might come to like me a little bit?\"\n\nIda gave a cry of fright. \"I won't like you if you run me against a\nbrick wall,\" she said, as the machine rasped up against the curb, \"Do\nattend to the steering.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will. But tell me, Ida, whether you will come with me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. It's too absurd! How can we talk about such things\nwhen I cannot see you? You speak to the nape of my neck, and then I have\nto twist my head round to answer.\"\n\n\"I know. That was why I put 'You in front' upon my letter. I thought\nthat it would make it easier. But if you would prefer it I will stop the\nmachine, and then you can sit round and talk about it.\"\n\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Ida. \"Fancy our sitting face to face on a\nmotionless tricycle in the middle of the road, and all the people\nlooking out of their windows at us!\"\n\n\"It would look rather funny, wouldn't it? Well, then, suppose that we\nboth get off and push the tandem along in front of us?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, this is better than that.\"\n\n\"Or I could carry the thing.\"\n\nIda burst out laughing. \"That would be more absurd still.\"\n\n\"Then we will go quietly, and I will look out for the steering. I won't\ntalk about it at all if you would rather not. But I really do love you\nvery much, and you would make me happy if you came to Texas with me, and\nI think that perhaps after a time I could make you happy too.\"\n\n\"But your aunt?\"\n\n\"Oh, she would like it very much. I can understand that your father\nmight not like to lose you. I'm sure I wouldn't either, if I were he.\nBut after all, America is not very far off nowadays, and is not so very\nwild. We would take a grand piano, and--and--a copy of Browning. And\nDenver and his wife would come over to see us. We should be quite a\nfamily party. It would be jolly.\"\n\nIda sat listening to the stumbling words and awkward phrases which\nwere whispered from the back of her, but there was something in Charles\nWestmacott's clumsiness of speech which was more moving than the words\nof the most eloquent of pleaders. He paused, he stammered, he caught his\nbreath between the words, and he blurted out in little blunt phrases all\nthe hopes of his heart. If love had not come to her yet, there was at\nleast pity and sympathy, which are nearly akin to it. Wonder there was\nalso that one so weak and frail as she should shake this strong man so,\nshould have the whole course of his life waiting for her decision. Her\nleft hand was on the cushion at her side. He leaned forward and took it\ngently in his own. She did not try to draw it back from him.\n\n\"May I have it,\" said he, \"for life?\"\n\n\"Oh, do attend to your steering,\" said she, smiling round at him; \"and\ndon't say any more about this to-day. Please don't!\"\n\n\"When shall I know, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, to-night, to-morrow, I don't know. I must ask Clara. Talk about\nsomething else.\"\n\nAnd they did talk about something else; but her left hand was still\nenclosed in his, and he knew, without asking again, that all was well.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. SHADOWS BEFORE.\n\n\nMrs. Westmacott's great meeting for the enfranchisement of woman had\npassed over, and it had been a triumphant success. All the maids and\nmatrons of the southern suburbs had rallied at her summons, there was an\ninfluential platform with Dr. Balthazar Walker in the chair, and Admiral\nHay Denver among his more prominent supporters. One benighted male had\ncome in from the outside darkness and had jeered from the further end\nof the hall, but he had been called to order by the chair, petrified\nby indignant glances from the unenfranchised around him, and finally\nescorted to the door by Charles Westmacott. Fiery resolutions were\npassed, to be forwarded to a large number of leading statesmen, and the\nmeeting broke up with the conviction that a shrewd blow had been struck\nfor the cause of woman.\n\nBut there was one woman at least to whom the meeting and all that\nwas connected with it had brought anything but pleasure. Clara Walker\nwatched with a heavy heart the friendship and close intimacy which had\nsprung up between her father and the widow. From week to week it had\nincreased until no day ever passed without their being together. The\ncoming meeting had been the excuse for these continual interviews, but\nnow the meeting was over, and still the Doctor would refer every point\nwhich rose to the judgment of his neighbor. He would talk, too, to his\ntwo daughters of her strength of character, her decisive mind, and of\nthe necessity of their cultivating her acquaintance and following\nher example, until at last it had become his most common topic of\nconversation.\n\nAll this might have passed as merely the natural pleasure which an\nelderly man might take in the society of an intelligent and handsome\nwoman, but there were other points which seemed to Clara to give it a\ndeeper meaning. She could not forget that when Charles Westmacott had\nspoken to her one night he had alluded to the possibility of his aunt\nmarrying again. He must have known or noticed something before he would\nspeak upon such a subject. And then again Mrs. Westmacott had herself\nsaid that she hoped to change her style of living shortly and take over\ncompletely new duties. What could that mean except that she expected to\nmarry? And whom? She seemed to see few friends outside their own little\ncircle. She must have alluded to her father. It was a hateful thought,\nand yet it must be faced.\n\nOne evening the Doctor had been rather late at his neighbor's. He used\nto go into the Admiral's after dinner, but now he turned more frequently\nin the other direction. When he returned Clara was sitting alone in the\ndrawing-room reading a magazine. She sprang up as he entered, pushed\nforward his chair, and ran to fetch his slippers.\n\n\"You are looking a little pale, dear,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Oh, no, papa, I am very well.\"\n\n\"All well with Harold?\"\n\n\"Yes. His partner, Mr. Pearson, is still away, and he is doing all the\nwork.\"\n\n\"Well done. He is sure to succeed. Where is Ida?\"\n\n\"In her room, I think.\"\n\n\"She was with Charles Westmacott on the lawn not very long ago. He seems\nvery fond of her. He is not very bright, but I think he will make her a\ngood husband.\"\n\n\"I am sure of it, papa. He is very manly and reliable.\"\n\n\"Yes, I should think that he is not the sort of man who goes wrong.\nThere is nothing hidden about him. As to his brightness, it really does\nnot matter, for his aunt, Mrs. Westmacott, is very rich, much richer\nthan you would think from her style of living, and she has made him a\nhandsome provision.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that.\"\n\n\"It is between ourselves. I am her trustee, and so I know something of\nher arrangements. And when are you going to marry, Clara?\"\n\n\"Oh, papa, not for some time yet. We have not thought of a date.\"\n\n\"Well, really, I don't know that there is any reason for delay. He has\na competence and it increases yearly. As long as you are quite certain\nthat your mind is made up----\"\n\n\"Oh, papa!\"\n\n\"Well, then, I really do not know why there should be any delay. And\nIda, too, must be married within the next few months. Now, what I want\nto know is what I am to do when my two little companions run away\nfrom me.\" He spoke lightly, but his eyes were grave as he looked\nquestioningly at his daughter.\n\n\"Dear papa, you shall not be alone. It will be years before Harold and I\nthink of marrying, and when we do you must come and live with us.\"\n\n\"No, no, dear. I know that you mean what you say, but I have seen\nsomething of the world, and I know that such arrangements never answer.\nThere cannot be two masters in a house, and yet at my age my freedom is\nvery necessary to me.\"\n\n\"But you would be completely free.\"\n\n\"No, dear, you cannot be that if you are a guest in another man's house.\nCan you suggest no other alternative?\"\n\n\"That we remain with you.\"\n\n\"No, no. That is out of the question. Mrs. Westmacott herself says that\na woman's first duty is to marry. Marriage, however, should be an equal\npartnership, as she points out. I should wish you both to marry, but\nstill I should like a suggestion from you, Clara, as to what I should\ndo.\"\n\n\"But there is no hurry, papa. Let us wait. I do not intend to marry\nyet.\"\n\nDoctor Walker looked disappointed. \"Well, Clara, if you can suggest\nnothing, I suppose that I must take the initiative myself,\" said he.\n\n\"Then what do you propose, papa?\" She braced herself as one who sees the\nblow which is about to fall.\n\nHe looked at her and hesitated. \"How like your poor dear mother you are,\nClara!\" he cried. \"As I looked at you then it was as if she had come\nback from the grave.\" He stooped towards her and kissed her. \"There,\nrun away to your sister, my dear, and do not trouble yourself about me.\nNothing is settled yet, but you will find that all will come right.\"\n\nClara went upstairs sad at heart, for she was sure now that what she had\nfeared was indeed about to come to pass, and that her father was going\nto take Mrs. Westmacott to be his wife. In her pure and earnest mind her\nmother's memory was enshrined as that of a saint, and the thought that\nany one should take her place seemed a terrible desecration. Even worse,\nhowever, did this marriage appear when looked at from the point of view\nof her father's future. The widow might fascinate him by her knowledge\nof the world, her dash, her strength, her unconventionality--all these\nqualities Clara was willing to allow her--but she was convinced that she\nwould be unendurable as a life companion. She had come to an age when\nhabits are not lightly to be changed, nor was she a woman who was at\nall likely to attempt to change them. How would a sensitive man like\nher father stand the constant strain of such a wife, a woman who was\nall decision, with no softness, and nothing soothing in her nature? It\npassed as a mere eccentricity when they heard of her stout drinking,\nher cigarette smoking, her occasional whiffs at a long clay pipe, her\nhorsewhipping of a drunken servant, and her companionship with the snake\nEliza, whom she was in the habit of bearing about in her pocket. All\nthis would become unendurable to her father when his first infatuation\nwas past. For his own sake, then, as well as for her mother's memory,\nthis match must be prevented. And yet how powerless she was to prevent\nit! What could she do? Could Harold aid her? Perhaps. Or Ida? At least\nshe would tell her sister and see what she could suggest.\n\nIda was in her boudoir, a tiny little tapestried room, as neat and\ndainty as herself, with low walls hung with Imari plaques and with\npretty little Swiss brackets bearing blue Kaga ware, or the pure white\nCoalport china. In a low chair beneath a red shaded standing lamp sat\nIda, in a diaphanous evening dress of mousseline de soie, the ruddy\nlight tinging her sweet childlike face, and glowing on her golden curls.\nShe sprang up as her sister entered, and threw her arms around her.\n\n\"Dear old Clara! Come and sit down here beside me. I have not had a chat\nfor days. But, oh, what a troubled face! What is it then?\" She put up\nher forefinger and smoothed her sister's brow with it.\n\nClara pulled up a stool, and sitting down beside her sister, passed her\narm round her waist. \"I am so sorry to trouble you, dear Ida,\" she said.\n\"But I do not know what to do.\n\n\"There's nothing the matter with Harold?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Ida.\"\n\n\"Nor with my Charles?\"\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\nIda gave a sigh of relief. \"You quite frightened me, dear,\" said she.\n\"You can't think how solemn you look. What is it, then?\"\n\n\"I believe that papa intends to ask Mrs. Westmacott to marry him.\"\n\nIda burst out laughing. \"What can have put such a notion into your head,\nClara?\"\n\n\"It is only too true, Ida. I suspected it before, and he himself almost\ntold me as much with his own lips to-night. I don't think that it is a\nlaughing matter.\"\n\n\"Really, I could not help it. If you had told me that those two dear old\nladies opposite, the Misses Williams, were both engaged, you would not\nhave surprised me more. It is really too funny.\"\n\n\"Funny, Ida! Think of any one taking the place of dear mother.\"\n\nBut her sister was of a more practical and less sentimental nature. \"I\nam sure,\" said she, \"that dear mother would like papa to do whatever\nwould make him most happy. We shall both be away, and why should papa\nnot please himself?\"\n\n\"But think how unhappy he will be. You know how quiet he is in his ways,\nand how even a little thing will upset him. How could he live with a\nwife who would make his whole life a series of surprises? Fancy what\na whirlwind she must be in a house. A man at his age cannot change his\nways. I am sure he would be miserable.\"\n\nIda's face grew graver, and she pondered over the matter for a few\nminutes. \"I really think that you are right as usual,\" said she at last.\n\"I admire Charlie's aunt very much, you know, and I think that she is\na very useful and good person, but I don't think she would do as a wife\nfor poor quiet papa.\"\n\n\"But he will certainly ask her, and I really think that she intends to\naccept him. Then it would be too late to interfere. We have only a few\ndays at the most. And what can we do? How can we hope to make him change\nhis mind?\"\n\nAgain Ida pondered. \"He has never tried what it is to live with a\nstrong-minded woman,\" said she. \"If we could only get him to realize\nit in time. Oh, Clara, I have it; I have it! Such a lovely plan!\" She\nleaned back in her chair and burst into a fit of laughter so natural and\nso hearty that Clara had to forget her troubles and to join in it.\n\n\"Oh, it is beautiful!\" she gasped at last. \"Poor papa! What a time he\nwill have! But it's all for his own good, as he used to say when we\nhad to be punished when we were little. Oh, Clara, I do hope your heart\nwon't fail you.\"\n\n\"I would do anything to save him, dear.\"\n\n\"That's it. You must steel yourself by that thought.\"\n\n\"But what is your plan?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so proud of it. We will tire him for ever of the widow, and\nof all emancipated women. Let me see, what are Mrs. Westmacott's main\nideas? You have listened to her more than I. Women should attend less to\nhousehold duties. That is one, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, if they feel they have capabilities for higher things. Then she\nthinks that every woman who has leisure should take up the study of\nsome branch of science, and that, as far as possible, every woman should\nqualify herself for some trade or profession, choosing for preference\nthose which have been hitherto monopolized by men. To enter the others\nwould only be to intensify the present competition.\"\n\n\"Quite so. That is glorious!\" Her blue eyes were dancing with mischief,\nand she clapped her hands in her delight. \"What else? She thinks that\nwhatever a man can do a woman should be allowed to do also--does she\nnot?\"\n\n\"She says so.\"\n\n\"And about dress? The short skirt, and the divided skirt are what she\nbelieves in?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"We must get in some cloth.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"We must make ourselves a dress each. A brand-new, enfranchised,\nemancipated dress, dear. Don't you see my plan? We shall act up to all\nMrs. Westmacott's views in every respect, and improve them when we can.\nThen papa will know what it is to live with a woman who claims all her\nrights. Oh, Clara, it will be splendid.\"\n\nHer milder sister sat speechless before so daring a scheme. \"But it\nwould be wrong, Ida!\" she cried at last.\n\n\"Not a bit. It is to save him.\"\n\n\"I should not dare.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you would. Harold will help. Besides, what other plan have\nyou?\"\n\n\"I have none.\"\n\n\"Then you must take mine.\"\n\n\"Yes. Perhaps you are right. Well, we do it for a good motive.\"\n\n\"You will do it?\"\n\n\"I do not see any other way.\"\n\n\"You dear good Clara! Now I will show you what you are to do. We must\nnot begin too suddenly. It might excite suspicion.\"\n\n\"What would you do, then?\"\n\n\"To-morrow we must go to Mrs. Westmacott, and sit at her feet and learn\nall her views.\"\n\n\"What hypocrites we shall feel!\"\n\n\"We shall be her newest and most enthusiastic converts. Oh, it will be\nsuch fun, Clara! Then we shall make our plans and send for what we want,\nand begin our new life.\"\n\n\"I do hope that we shall not have to keep it up long. It seems so cruel\nto dear papa.\"\n\n\"Cruel! To save him!\"\n\n\"I wish I was sure that we were doing right. And yet what else can\nwe do? Well, then, Ida, the die is cast, and we will call upon Mrs.\nWestmacott tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. A FAMILY PLOT.\n\n\nLittle did poor Doctor Walker imagine as he sat at his breakfast-table\nnext morning that the two sweet girls who sat on either side of him were\ndeep in a conspiracy, and that he, munching innocently at his muffins,\nwas the victim against whom their wiles were planned. Patiently they\nwaited until at last their opening came.\n\n\"It is a beautiful day,\" he remarked. \"It will do for Mrs. Westmacott.\nShe was thinking of having a spin upon the tricycle.\"\n\n\"Then we must call early. We both intended to see her after breakfast.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" The Doctor looked pleased.\n\n\"You know, pa,\" said Ida, \"it seems to us that we really have a very\ngreat advantage in having Mrs. Westmacott living so near.\"\n\n\"Why so, dear?\"\n\n\"Well, because she is so advanced, you know. If we only study her ways\nwe may advance ourselves also.\"\n\n\"I think I have heard you say, papa,\" Clara remarked, \"that she is the\ntype of the woman of the future.\"\n\n\"I am very pleased to hear you speak so sensibly, my dears. I certainly\nthink that she is a woman whom you may very well take as your model. The\nmore intimate you are with her the better pleased I shall be.\"\n\n\"Then that is settled,\" said Clara demurely, and the talk drifted to\nother matters.\n\nAll the morning the two girls sat extracting from Mrs. Westmacott her\nmost extreme view as to the duty of the one sex and the tyranny of the\nother. Absolute equality, even in details, was her ideal. Enough of the\nparrot cry of unwomanly and unmaidenly. It had been invented by man\nto scare woman away when she poached too nearly upon his precious\npreserves. Every woman should be independent. Every woman should learn a\ntrade. It was their duty to push in where they were least welcome. Then\nthey were martyrs to the cause, and pioneers to their weaker sisters.\nWhy should the wash-tub, the needle, and the housekeeper's book be\neternally theirs? Might they not reach higher, to the consulting-room,\nto the bench, and even to the pulpit? Mrs. Westmacott sacrificed her\ntricycle ride in her eagerness over her pet subject, and her two fair\ndisciples drank in every word, and noted every suggestion for future\nuse. That afternoon they went shopping in London, and before evening\nstrange packages began to be handed in at the Doctor's door. The plot\nwas ripe for execution, and one of the conspirators was merry and\njubilant, while the other was very nervous and troubled.\n\nWhen the Doctor came down to the dining-room next morning, he was\nsurprised to find that his daughters had already been up some time. Ida\nwas installed at one end of the table with a spirit-lamp, a curved glass\nflask, and several bottles in front of her. The contents of the flask\nwere boiling furiously, while a villainous smell filled the room. Clara\nlounged in an arm-chair with her feet upon a second one, a blue-covered\nbook in her hand, and a huge map of the British Islands spread across\nher lap. \"Hullo!\" cried the Doctor, blinking and sniffing, \"where's the\nbreakfast?\"\n\n\"Oh, didn't you order it?\" asked Ida.\n\n\"I! No; why should I?\" He rang the bell. \"Why have you not laid the\nbreakfast, Jane?\"\n\n\"If you please, sir, Miss Ida was a workin' at the table.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course, Jane,\" said the young lady calmly. \"I am so sorry. I\nshall be ready to move in a few minutes.\"\n\n\"But what on earth are you doing, Ida?\" asked the Doctor. \"The smell is\nmost offensive. And, good gracious, look at the mess which you have made\nupon the cloth! Why, you have burned a hole right through.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is the acid,\" Ida answered contentedly. \"Mrs. Westmacott said\nthat it would burn holes.\"\n\n\"You might have taken her word for it without trying,\" said her father\ndryly.\n\n\"But look here, pa! See what the book says: 'The scientific mind takes\nnothing upon trust. Prove all things!' I have proved that.\"\n\n\"You certainly have. Well, until breakfast is ready I'll glance over the\nTimes. Have you seen it?\"\n\n\"The Times? Oh, dear me, this is it which I have under my spirit-lamp.\nI am afraid there is some acid upon that too, and it is rather damp and\ntorn. Here it is.\"\n\nThe Doctor took the bedraggled paper with a rueful face. \"Everything\nseems to be wrong to-day,\" he remarked. \"What is this sudden enthusiasm\nabout chemistry, Ida?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am trying to live up to Mrs. Westmacott's teaching.\"\n\n\"Quite right! quite right!\" said he, though perhaps with less heartiness\nthan he had shown the day before. \"Ah, here is breakfast at last!\"\n\nBut nothing was comfortable that morning. There were eggs without\negg-spoons, toast which was leathery from being kept, dried-up rashers,\nand grounds in the coffee. Above all, there was that dreadful smell\nwhich pervaded everything and gave a horrible twang to every mouthful.\n\n\"I don't wish to put a damper upon your studies, Ida,\" said the Doctor,\nas he pushed back his chair. \"But I do think it would be better if you\ndid your chemical experiments a little later in the day.\"\n\n\"But Mrs. Westmacott says that women should rise early, and do their\nwork before breakfast.\"\n\n\"Then they should choose some other room besides the breakfast-room.\"\nThe Doctor was becoming just a little ruffled. A turn in the open air\nwould soothe him, he thought. \"Where are my boots?\" he asked.\n\nBut they were not in their accustomed corner by his chair. Up and down\nhe searched, while the three servants took up the quest, stooping and\npeeping under book-cases and drawers. Ida had returned to her studies,\nand Clara to her blue-covered volume, sitting absorbed and disinterested\namid the bustle and the racket. At last a general buzz of congratulation\nannounced that the cook had discovered the boots hung up among the\nhats in the hall. The Doctor, very red and flustered, drew them on, and\nstamped off to join the Admiral in his morning walk.\n\nAs the door slammed Ida burst into a shout of laughter. \"You see,\nClara,\" she cried, \"the charm works already. He has gone to number one\ninstead of to number three. Oh, we shall win a great victory. You've\nbeen very good, dear; I could see that you were on thorns to help him\nwhen he was looking for his boots.\"\n\n\"Poor papa! It is so cruel. And yet what are we to do?\"\n\n\"Oh, he will enjoy being comfortable all the more if we give him a\nlittle discomfort now. What horrible work this chemistry is! Look at\nmy frock! It is ruined. And this dreadful smell!\" She threw open the\nwindow, and thrust her little golden-curled head out of it. Charles\nWestmacott was hoeing at the other side of the garden fence.\n\n\"Good morning, sir,\" said Ida.\n\n\"Good morning!\" The big man leaned upon his hoe and looked up at her.\n\n\"Have you any cigarettes, Charles?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\n\n\"Throw me up two.\"\n\n\"Here is my case. Can you catch!\"\n\nA seal-skin case came with a soft thud on to the floor. Ida opened it.\nIt was full.\n\n\"What are these?\" she asked.\n\n\"Egyptians.\"\n\n\"What are some other brands?\"\n\n\"Oh, Richmond Gems, and Turkish, and Cambridge. But why?\"\n\n\"Never mind!\" She nodded to him and closed the window. \"We must remember\nall those, Clara,\" said she. \"We must learn to talk about such things.\nMrs. Westmacott knows all about the brands of cigarettes. Has your rum\ncome?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear. It is here.\"\n\n\"And I have my stout. Come along up to my room now. This smell is too\nabominable. But we must be ready for him when he comes back. If we sit\nat the window we shall see him coming down the road.\"\n\nThe fresh morning air, and the genial company of the Admiral had caused\nthe Doctor to forget his troubles, and he came back about midday in an\nexcellent humor. As he opened the hall door the vile smell of chemicals\nwhich had spoilt his breakfast met him with a redoubled virulence. He\nthrew open the hall window, entered the dining-room, and stood aghast at\nthe sight which met his eyes.\n\nIda was still sitting among her bottles, with a lit cigarette in her\nleft hand and a glass of stout on the table beside her. Clara, with\nanother cigarette, was lounging in the easy chair with several maps\nspread out upon the floor around. Her feet were stuck up on the coal\nscuttle, and she had a tumblerful of some reddish-brown composition on\nthe smoking table close at her elbow. The Doctor gazed from one to the\nother of them through the thin grey haze of smoke, but his eyes rested\nfinally in a settled stare of astonishment upon his elder and more\nserious daughter.\n\n\"Clara!\" he gasped, \"I could not have believed it!\"\n\n\"What is it, papa?\"\n\n\"You are smoking!\"\n\n\"Trying to, papa. I find it a little difficult, for I have not been used\nto it.\"\n\n\"But why, in the name of goodness--\"\n\n\"Mrs. Westmacott recommends it.\"\n\n\"Oh, a lady of mature years may do many things which a young girl must\navoid.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" cried Ida, \"Mrs. Westmacott says that there should be one law\nfor all. Have a cigarette, pa?\"\n\n\"No, thank you. I never smoke in the morning.\"\n\n\"No? Perhaps you don't care for the brand. What are these, Clara?\"\n\n\"Egyptians.\"\n\n\"Ah, we must have some Richmond Gems or Turkish. I wish, pa, when you go\ninto town, you would get me some Turkish.\"\n\n\"I will do nothing of the kind. I do not at all think that it is a\nfitting habit for young ladies. I do not agree with Mrs. Westmacott upon\nthe point.\"\n\n\"Really, pa! It was you who advised us to imitate her.\"\n\n\"But with discrimination. What is it that you are drinking, Clara?\"\n\n\"Rum, papa.\"\n\n\"Rum? In the morning?\" He sat down and rubbed his eyes as one who tries\nto shake off some evil dream. \"Did you say rum?\"\n\n\"Yes, pa. They all drink it in the profession which I am going to take\nup.\"\n\n\"Profession, Clara?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Westmacott says that every woman should follow a calling, and that\nwe ought to choose those which women have always avoided.\"\n\n\"Quite so.\"\n\n\"Well, I am going to act upon her advice. I am going to be a pilot.\"\n\n\"My dear Clara! A pilot! This is too much.\"\n\n\"This is a beautiful book, papa. 'The Lights, Beacons, Buoys, Channels,\nand Landmarks of Great Britain.' Here is another, 'The Master Mariner's\nHandbook.' You can't imagine how interesting it is.\"\n\n\"You are joking, Clara. You must be joking!\"\n\n\"Not at all, pa. You can't think what a lot I have learned already.\nI'm to carry a green light to starboard and a red to port, with a white\nlight at the mast-head, and a flare-up every fifteen minutes.\"\n\n\"Oh, won't it look pretty at night!\" cried her sister.\n\n\"And I know the fog-signals. One blast means that a ship steers to\nstarboard, two to port, three astern, four that it is unmanageable. But\nthis man asks such dreadful questions at the end of each chapter. Listen\nto this: 'You see a red light. The ship is on the port tack and the wind\nat north; what course is that ship steering to a point?'\"\n\nThe Doctor rose with a gesture of despair. \"I can't imagine what has\ncome over you both,\" said he.\n\n\"My dear papa, we are trying hard to live up to Mrs. Westmacott's\nstandard.\"\n\n\"Well, I must say that I do not admire the result. Your chemistry, Ida,\nmay perhaps do no harm; but your scheme, Clara, is out of the question.\nHow a girl of your sense could ever entertain such a notion is more than\nI can imagine. But I must absolutely forbid you to go further with it.\"\n\n\"But, pa,\" asked Ida, with an air of innocent inquiry in her big blue\neyes, \"what are we to do when your commands and Mrs. Westmacott's advice\nare opposed? You told us to obey her. She says that when women try to\nthrow off their shackles, their fathers, brothers and husbands are the\nvery first to try to rivet them on again, and that in such a matter no\nman has any authority.\"\n\n\"Does Mrs. Westmacott teach you that I am not the head of my own house?\"\nThe Doctor flushed, and his grizzled hair bristled in his anger.\n\n\"Certainly. She says that all heads of houses are relics of the dark\nages.\"\n\nThe Doctor muttered something and stamped his foot upon the carpet. Then\nwithout a word he passed out into the garden and his daughters could see\nhim striding furiously up and down, cutting off the heads of the flowers\nwith a switch.\n\n\"Oh, you darling! You played your part so splendidly!\" cried Ida.\n\n\"But how cruel it is! When I saw the sorrow and surprise in his eyes I\nvery nearly put my arms about him and told him all. Don't you think we\nhave done enough?\"\n\n\"No, no, no. Not nearly enough. You must not turn weak now, Clara. It is\nso funny that I should be leading you. It is quite a new experience. But\nI know I am right. If we go on as we are doing, we shall be able to say\nall our lives that we have saved him. And if we don't, oh, Clara, we\nshould never forgive ourselves.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. WOMEN OF THE FUTURE.\n\n\nFrom that day the Doctor's peace was gone. Never was a quiet and orderly\nhousehold transformed so suddenly into a bear garden, or a happy man\nturned into such a completely miserable one. He had never realized\nbefore how entirely his daughters had shielded him from all the friction\nof life. Now that they had not only ceased to protect him, but had\nthemselves become a source of trouble to him, he began to understand how\ngreat the blessing was which he had enjoyed, and to sigh for the happy\ndays before his girls had come under the influence of his neighbor.\n\n\"You don't look happy,\" Mrs. Westmacott had remarked to him one morning.\n\"You are pale and a little off color. You should come with me for a ten\nmile spin upon the tandem.\"\n\n\"I am troubled about my girls.\" They were walking up and down in the\ngarden. From time to time there sounded from the house behind them the\nlong, sad wail of a French horn.\n\n\"That is Ida,\" said he. \"She has taken to practicing on that dreadful\ninstrument in the intervals of her chemistry. And Clara is quite as bad.\nI declare it is getting quite unendurable.\"\n\n\"Ah, Doctor, Doctor!\" she cried, shaking her forefinger, with a gleam\nof her white teeth. \"You must live up to your principles--you must give\nyour daughters the same liberty as you advocate for other women.\"\n\n\"Liberty, madam, certainly! But this approaches to license.\"\n\n\"The same law for all, my friend.\" She tapped him reprovingly on the arm\nwith her sunshade. \"When you were twenty your father did not, I presume,\nobject to your learning chemistry or playing a musical instrument. You\nwould have thought it tyranny if he had.\"\n\n\"But there is such a sudden change in them both.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have noticed that they have been very enthusiastic lately in the\ncause of liberty. Of all my disciples I think that they promise to be\nthe most devoted and consistent, which is the more natural since their\nfather is one of our most trusted champions.\"\n\nThe Doctor gave a twitch of impatience. \"I seem to have lost all\nauthority,\" he cried.\n\n\"No, no, my dear friend. They are a little exuberant at having broken\nthe trammels of custom. That is all.\"\n\n\"You cannot think what I have had to put up with, madam. It has been a\ndreadful experience. Last night, after I had extinguished the candle\nin my bedroom, I placed my foot upon something smooth and hard, which\nscuttled from under me. Imagine my horror! I lit the gas, and came upon\na well-grown tortoise which Clara has thought fit to introduce into the\nhouse. I call it a filthy custom to have such pets.\"\n\nMrs. Westmacott dropped him a little courtesy. \"Thank you, sir,\" said\nshe. \"That is a nice little side hit at my poor Eliza.\"\n\n\"I give you my word that I had forgotten about her,\" cried the Doctor,\nflushing. \"One such pet may no doubt be endured, but two are more than I\ncan bear. Ida has a monkey which lives on the curtain rod. It is a most\ndreadful creature. It will remain absolutely motionless until it sees\nthat you have forgotten its presence, and then it will suddenly bound\nfrom picture to picture all round the walls, and end by swinging down\non the bell-rope and jumping on to the top of your head. At breakfast\nit stole a poached egg and daubed it all over the door handle. Ida calls\nthese outrages amusing tricks.\"\n\n\"Oh, all will come right,\" said the widow reassuringly.\n\n\"And Clara is as bad, Clara who used to be so good and sweet, the very\nimage of her poor mother. She insists upon this preposterous scheme of\nbeing a pilot, and will talk of nothing but revolving lights and hidden\nrocks, and codes of signals, and nonsense of the kind.\"\n\n\"But why preposterous?\" asked his companion. \"What nobler occupation can\nthere be than that of stimulating commerce, and aiding the mariner to\nsteer safely into port? I should think your daughter admirably adapted\nfor such duties.\"\n\n\"Then I must beg to differ from you, madam.\"\n\n\"Still, you are inconsistent.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, madam, I do not see the matter in the same light. And\nI should be obliged to you if you would use your influence with my\ndaughter to dissuade her.\"\n\n\"You wish to make me inconsistent too.\"\n\n\"Then you refuse?\"\n\n\"I am afraid that I cannot interfere.\"\n\nThe Doctor was very angry. \"Very well, madam,\" said he. \"In that case I\ncan only say that I have the honor to wish you a very good morning.\" He\nraised his broad straw hat and strode away up the gravel path, while the\nwidow looked after him with twinkling eyes. She was surprised herself to\nfind that she liked the Doctor better the more masculine and aggressive\nhe became. It was unreasonable and against all principle, and yet so it\nwas and no argument could mend the matter.\n\nVery hot and angry, the Doctor retired into his room and sat down to\nread his paper. Ida had retired, and the distant wails of the bugle\nshowed that she was upstairs in her boudoir. Clara sat opposite to him\nwith her exasperating charts and her blue book. The Doctor glanced at\nher and his eyes remained fixed in astonishment upon the front of her\nskirt.\n\n\"My dear Clara,\" he cried, \"you have torn your skirt!\"\n\nHis daughter laughed and smoothed out her frock. To his horror he saw\nthe red plush of the chair where the dress ought to have been. \"It is\nall torn!\" he cried. \"What have you done?\"\n\n\"My dear papa!\" said she, \"what do you know about the mysteries of\nladies' dress? This is a divided skirt.\"\n\nThen he saw that it was indeed so arranged, and that his daughter was\nclad in a sort of loose, extremely long knickerbockers.\n\n\"It will be so convenient for my sea-boots,\" she explained.\n\nHer father shook his head sadly. \"Your dear mother would not have liked\nit, Clara,\" said he.\n\nFor a moment the conspiracy was upon the point of collapsing. There\nwas something in the gentleness of his rebuke, and in his appeal to her\nmother, which brought the tears to her eyes, and in another instant she\nwould have been kneeling beside him with everything confessed, when the\ndoor flew open and her sister Ida came bounding into the room. She wore\na short grey skirt, like that of Mrs. Westmacott, and she held it up in\neach hand and danced about among the furniture.\n\n\"I feel quite the Gaiety girl!\" she cried. \"How delicious it must be\nto be upon the stage! You can't think how nice this dress is, papa. One\nfeels so free in it. And isn't Clara charming?\"\n\n\"Go to your room this instant and take it off!\" thundered the Doctor. \"I\ncall it highly improper, and no daughter of mine shall wear it.\"\n\n\"Papa! Improper! Why, it is the exact model of Mrs. Westmacott's.\"\n\n\"I say it is improper. And yours also, Clara! Your conduct is really\noutrageous. You drive me out of the house. I am going to my club in\ntown. I have no comfort or peace of mind in my own house. I will stand\nit no longer. I may be late to-night--I shall go to the British\nMedical meeting. But when I return I shall hope to find that you have\nreconsidered your conduct, and that you have shaken yourself clear of\nthe pernicious influences which have recently made such an alteration\nin your conduct.\" He seized his hat, slammed the dining-room door, and a\nfew minutes later they heard the crash of the big front gate.\n\n\"Victory, Clara, victory!\" cried Ida, still pirouetting around the\nfurniture. \"Did you hear what he said? Pernicious influences! Don't you\nunderstand, Clara? Why do you sit there so pale and glum? Why don't you\nget up and dance?\"\n\n\"Oh, I shall be so glad when it is over, Ida. I do hate to give him\npain. Surely he has learned now that it is very unpleasant to spend\none's life with reformers.\"\n\n\"He has almost learned it, Clara. Just one more little lesson. We must\nnot risk all at this last moment.\"\n\n\"What would you do, Ida? Oh, don't do anything too dreadful. I feel that\nwe have gone too far already.\"\n\n\"Oh, we can do it very nicely. You see we are both engaged and that\nmakes it very easy. Harold will do what you ask him, especially as you\nhave told him the reason why, and my Charles will do it without even\nwanting to know the reason. Now you know what Mrs. Westmacott thinks\nabout the reserve of young ladies. Mere prudery, affectation, and a\nrelic of the dark ages of the Zenana. Those were her words, were they\nnot?\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Well, now we must put it in practice. We are reducing all her other\nviews to practice, and we must not shirk this one.\n\n\"But what would you do? Oh, don't look so wicked, Ida! You look like\nsome evil little fairy, with your golden hair and dancing, mischievous\neyes. I know that you are going to propose something dreadful!\"\n\n\"We must give a little supper to-night.\"\n\n\"We? A supper!\"\n\n\"Why not? Young gentlemen give suppers. Why not young ladies?\"\n\n\"But whom shall we invite?\"\n\n\"Why, Harold and Charles of course.\"\n\n\"And the Admiral and Mrs. Hay Denver?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. That would be very old-fashioned. We must keep up with the\ntimes, Clara.\"\n\n\"But what can we give them for supper?\"\n\n\"Oh, something with a nice, fast, rollicking, late-at-night-kind of\nflavor to it. Let me see! Champagne, of course--and oysters. Oysters\nwill do. In the novels, all the naughty people take champagne and\noysters. Besides, they won't need any cooking. How is your pocket-money,\nClara?\"\n\n\"I have three pounds.\"\n\n\"And I have one. Four pounds. I have no idea how much champagne costs.\nHave you?\"\n\n\"Not the slightest.\"\n\n\"How many oysters does a man eat?\"\n\n\"I can't imagine.\"\n\n\"I'll write and ask Charles. No, I won't. I'll ask Jane. Ring for her,\nClara. She has been a cook, and is sure to know.\"\n\nJane, on being cross-questioned, refused to commit herself beyond\nthe statement that it depended upon the gentleman, and also upon the\noysters. The united experience of the kitchen, however, testified that\nthree dozen was a fair provision.\n\n\"Then we shall have eight dozen altogether,\" said Ida, jotting down all\nher requirements upon a sheet of paper. \"And two pints of champagne. And\nsome brown bread, and vinegar, and pepper. That's all, I think. It is\nnot so very difficult to give a supper after all, is it, Clara?\"\n\n\"I don't like it, Ida. It seems to me to be so very indelicate.\"\n\n\"But it is needed to clinch the matter. No, no, there is no drawing back\nnow, Clara, or we shall ruin everything. Papa is sure to come back by\nthe 9:45. He will reach the door at 10. We must have everything ready\nfor him. Now, just sit down at once, and ask Harold to come at nine\no'clock, and I shall do the same to Charles.\"\n\nThe two invitations were dispatched, received and accepted. Harold\nwas already a confidant, and he understood that this was some further\ndevelopment of the plot. As to Charles, he was so accustomed to feminine\neccentricity, in the person of his aunt, that the only thing which could\nsurprise him would be a rigid observance of etiquette. At nine o'clock\nthey entered the dining-room of Number 2, to find the master of the\nhouse absent, a red-shaded lamp, a snowy cloth, a pleasant little feast,\nand the two whom they would have chosen, as their companions. A merrier\nparty never met, and the house rang with their laughter and their\nchatter.\n\n\"It is three minutes to ten,\" cried Clara, suddenly, glancing at the\nclock.\n\n\"Good gracious! So it is! Now for our little tableau!\" Ida pushed the\nchampagne bottles obtrusively forward, in the direction of the door, and\nscattered oyster shells over the cloth.\n\n\"Have you your pipe, Charles?\"\n\n\"My pipe! Yes.\"\n\n\"Then please smoke it. Now don't argue about it, but do it, for you will\nruin the effect otherwise.\"\n\nThe large man drew out a red case, and extracted a great yellow\nmeerschaum, out of which, a moment later, he was puffing thick wreaths\nof smoke. Harold had lit a cigar, and both the girls had cigarettes.\n\n\"That looks very nice and emancipated,\" said Ida, glancing round. \"Now I\nshall lie on this sofa. So! Now, Charles, just sit here, and throw your\narm carelessly over the back of the sofa. No, don't stop smoking. I like\nit. Clara, dear, put your feet upon the coal-scuttle, and do try to look\na little dissipated. I wish we could crown ourselves with flowers. There\nare some lettuces on the sideboard. Oh dear, here he is! I hear his\nkey.\" She began to sing in her high, fresh voice a little snatch from a\nFrench song, with a swinging tra la-la chorus.\n\nThe Doctor had walked home from the station in a peaceable and relenting\nframe of mind, feeling that, perhaps, he had said too much in the\nmorning, that his daughters had for years been models in every way,\nand that, if there had been any change of late, it was, as they said\nthemselves, on account of their anxiety to follow his advice and to\nimitate Mrs. Westmacott. He could see clearly enough now that that\nadvice was unwise, and that a world peopled with Mrs. Westmacotts would\nnot be a happy or a soothing one. It was he who was, himself, to\nblame, and he was grieved by the thought that perhaps his hot words had\ntroubled and saddened his two girls.\n\nThis fear, however, was soon dissipated. As he entered his hall he heard\nthe voice of Ida uplifted in a rollicking ditty, and a very strong smell\nof tobacco was borne to his nostrils. He threw open the dining-room\ndoor, and stood aghast at the scene which met his eyes.\n\nThe room was full of the blue wreaths of smoke, and the lamp-light shone\nthrough the thin haze upon gold-topped bottles, plates, napkins, and a\nlitter of oyster shells and cigarettes. Ida, flushed and excited, was\nreclining upon the settee, a wine-glass at her elbow, and a cigarette\nbetween her fingers, while Charles Westmacott sat beside her, with his\narm thrown over the head of the sofa, with the suggestion of a caress.\nOn the other side of the room, Clara was lounging in an arm-chair, with\nHarold beside her, both smoking, and both with wine-glasses beside them.\nThe Doctor stood speechless in the doorway, staring at the Bacchanalian\nscene.\n\n\"Come in, papa! Do!\" cried Ida. \"Won't you have a glass of champagne?\"\n\n\"Pray excuse me,\" said her father, coldly, \"I feel that I am intruding.\nI did not know that you were entertaining. Perhaps you will kindly\nlet me know when you have finished. You will find me in my study.\" He\nignored the two young men completely, and, closing the door, retired,\ndeeply hurt and mortified, to his room. A quarter of an hour afterwards\nhe heard the door slam, and his two daughters came to announce that the\nguests were gone.\n\n\"Guests! Whose guests?\" he cried angrily. \"What is the meaning of this\nexhibition?\"\n\n\"We have been giving a little supper, papa. They were our guests.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" The Doctor laughed sarcastically. \"You think it right,\nthen, to entertain young bachelors late at night, to smoke and drink\nwith them, to---- Oh, that I should ever have lived to blush for my own\ndaughters! I thank God that your dear mother never saw the day.\"\n\n\"Dearest papa,\" cried Clara, throwing her arms about him. \"Do not be\nangry with us. If you understood all, you would see that there is no\nharm in it.\"\n\n\"No harm, miss! Who is the best judge of that?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Westmacott,\" suggested Ida, slyly.\n\nThe Doctor sprang from his chair. \"Confound Mrs. Westmacott!\" he cried,\nstriking frenziedly into the air with his hands. \"Am I to hear of\nnothing but this woman? Is she to confront me at every turn? I will\nendure it no longer.\"\n\n\"But it was your wish, papa.\"\n\n\"Then I will tell you now what my second and wiser wish is, and we shall\nsee if you will obey it as you have the first.\"\n\n\"Of course we will, papa.\"\n\n\"Then my wish is, that you should forget these odious notions which you\nhave imbibed, that you should dress and act as you used to do,\nbefore ever you saw this woman, and that, in future, you confine\nyour intercourse with her to such civilities as are necessary between\nneighbors.\"\n\n\"We are to give up Mrs. Westmacott?\"\n\n\"Or give up me.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear dad, how can you say anything so cruel?\" cried Ida, burrowing\nher towsy golden hair into her father's shirt front, while Clara pressed\nher cheek against his whisker. \"Of course we shall give her up, if you\nprefer it.\"\n\n\"Of course we shall, papa.\"\n\nThe Doctor patted the two caressing heads. \"These are my own two girls\nagain,\" he cried. \"It has been my fault as much as yours. I have been\nastray, and you have followed me in my error. It was only by seeing your\nmistake that I have become conscious of my own. Let us set it aside, and\nneither say nor think anything more about it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. A BLOT FROM THE BLUE.\n\n\nSo by the cleverness of two girls a dark cloud was thinned away\nand turned into sunshine. Over one of them, alas, another cloud was\ngathering, which could not be so easily dispersed. Of these three\nhouseholds which fate had thrown together, two had already been united\nby ties of love. It was destined, however, that a bond of another sort\nshould connect the Westmacotts with the Hay Denvers.\n\nBetween the Admiral and the widow a very cordial feeling had existed\nsince the day when the old seaman had hauled down his flag and changed\nhis opinions; granting to the yachts-woman all that he had refused to\nthe reformer. His own frank and downright nature respected the same\nqualities in his neighbor, and a friendship sprang up between them which\nwas more like that which exists between two men, founded upon esteem and\na community of tastes.\n\n\"By the way, Admiral,\" said Mrs. Westmacott one morning, as they walked\ntogether down to the station, \"I understand that this boy of yours in\nthe intervals of paying his devotions to Miss Walker is doing something\nupon 'Change.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, and there is no man of his age who is doing so well. He's\ndrawing ahead, I can tell you, ma'am. Some of those that started with\nhim are hull down astarn now. He touched his five hundred last year, and\nbefore he's thirty he'll be making the four figures.\"\n\n\"The reason I asked is that I have small investments to make myself from\ntime to time, and my present broker is a rascal. I should be very glad\nto do it through your son.\"\n\n\"It is very kind of you, ma'am. His partner is away on a holiday, and\nHarold would like to push on a bit and show what he can do. You know\nthe poop isn't big enough to hold the lieutenant when the skipper's on\nshore.\"\n\n\"I suppose he charges the usual half per cent?\"\n\n\"Don't know, I'm sure, ma'am. I'll swear that he does what is right and\nproper.\"\n\n\"That is what I usually pay--ten shillings in the hundred pounds. If\nyou see him before I do just ask him to get me five thousand in New\nZealands. It is at four just now, and I fancy it may rise.\"\n\n\"Five thousand!\" exclaimed the Admiral, reckoning it in his own mind.\n\"Lemme see! That's twenty-five pounds commission. A nice day's work,\nupon my word. It is a very handsome order, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Well, I must pay some one, and why not him?\"\n\n\"I'll tell him, and I'm sure he'll lose no time.\"\n\n\"Oh, there is no great hurry. By the way, I understand from what you\nsaid just now that he has a partner.\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy is the junior partner. Pearson is the senior. I was\nintroduced to him years ago, and he offered Harold the opening. Of\ncourse we had a pretty stiff premium to pay.\"\n\nMrs. Westmacott had stopped, and was standing very stiffly with her Red\nIndian face even grimmer than usual.\n\n\"Pearson?\" said she. \"Jeremiah Pearson?\"\n\n\"The same.\"\n\n\"Then it's all off,\" she cried. \"You need not carry out that\ninvestment.\"\n\n\"Very well, ma'am.\"\n\nThey walked on together side by side, she brooding over some thought of\nher own, and he a little crossed and disappointed at her caprice and the\nlost commission for Harold.\n\n\"I tell you what, Admiral,\" she exclaimed suddenly, \"if I were you I\nshould get your boy out of this partnership.\"\n\n\"But why, madam?\"\n\n\"Because he is tied to one of the deepest, slyest foxes in the whole\ncity of London.\"\n\n\"Jeremiah Pearson, ma'am? What can you know of him? He bears a good\nname.\"\n\n\"No one in this world knows Jeremiah Pearson as I know him, Admiral.\nI warn you because I have a friendly feeling both for you and for your\nson. The man is a rogue and you had best avoid him.\"\n\n\"But these are only words, ma'am. Do you tell me that you know him\nbetter than the brokers and jobbers in the City?\"\n\n\"Man,\" cried Mrs. Westmacott, \"will you allow that I know him when I\ntell you that my maiden name was Ada Pearson, and that Jeremiah is my\nonly brother?\"\n\nThe Admiral whistled. \"Whew!\" cried he. \"Now that I think of it, there\nis a likeness.\"\n\n\"He is a man of iron, Admiral--a man without a heart. I should shock you\nif I were to tell you what I have endured from my brother. My father's\nwealth was divided equally between us. His own share he ran through in\nfive years, and he has tried since then by every trick of a cunning,\nlow-minded man, by base cajolery, by legal quibbles, by brutal\nintimidation, to juggle me out of my share as well. There is no villainy\nof which the man is not capable. Oh, I know my brother Jeremiah. I know\nhim and I am prepared for him.\"\n\n\"This is all new to me, ma'am. 'Pon my word, I hardly know what to say\nto it. I thank you for having spoken so plainly. From what you say, this\nis a poor sort of consort for a man to sail with. Perhaps Harold would\ndo well to cut himself adrift.\"\n\n\"Without losing a day.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall talk it over. You may be sure of that. But here we are\nat the station, so I will just see you into your carriage and then home\nto see what my wife says to the matter.\"\n\nAs he trudged homewards, thoughtful and perplexed, he was surprised to\nhear a shout behind him, and to see Harold running down the road after\nhim.\n\n\"Why, dad,\" he cried, \"I have just come from town, and the first thing\nI saw was your back as you marched away. But you are such a quick walker\nthat I had to run to catch you.\"\n\nThe Admiral's smile of pleasure had broken his stern face into a\nthousand wrinkles. \"You are early to-day,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, I wanted to consult you.\"\n\n\"Nothing wrong?\"\n\n\"Oh no, only an inconvenience.\"\n\n\"What is it, then?\"\n\n\"How much have we in our private account?\"\n\n\"Pretty fair. Some eight hundred, I think.\"\n\n\"Oh, half that will be ample. It was rather thoughtless of Pearson.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Well, you see, dad, when he went away upon this little holiday to Havre\nhe left me to pay accounts and so on. He told me that there was enough\nat the bank for all claims. I had occasion on Tuesday to pay away two\ncheques, one for L80, and the other for L120, and here they are returned\nwith a bank notice that we have already overdrawn to the extent of some\nhundreds.\"\n\nThe Admiral looked very grave. \"What's the meaning of that, then?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Oh, it can easily be set right. You see Pearson invests all the spare\ncapital and keeps as small a margin as possible at the bank. Still it\nwas too bad for him to allow me even to run a risk of having a cheque\nreturned. I have written to him and demanded his authority to sell out\nsome stock, and I have written an explanation to these people. In the\nmeantime, however, I have had to issue several cheques; so I had better\ntransfer part of our private account to meet them.\"\n\n\"Quite so, my boy. All that's mine is yours. But who do you think this\nPearson is? He is Mrs. Westmacott's brother.\"\n\n\"Really. What a singular thing! Well, I can see a likeness now that you\nmention it. They have both the same hard type of face.\"\n\n\"She has been warning me against him--says he is the rankest pirate\nin London. I hope that it is all right, boy, and that we may not find\nourselves in broken water.\"\n\nHarold had turned a little pale as he heard Mrs. Westmacott's opinion of\nhis senior partner. It gave shape and substance to certain vague fears\nand suspicions of his own which had been pushed back as often as they\nobtruded themselves as being too monstrous and fantastic for belief.\n\n\"He is a well-known man in the City, dad,\" said he.\n\n\"Of course he is--of course he is. That is what I told her. They would\nhave found him out there if anything had been amiss with him. Bless you,\nthere's nothing so bitter as a family quarrel. Still it is just as well\nthat you have written about this affair, for we may as well have all\nfair and aboveboard.\"\n\nBut Harold's letter to his partner was crossed by a letter from his\npartner to Harold. It lay awaiting him upon the breakfast table next\nmorning, and it sent the heart into his mouth as he read it, and caused\nhim to spring up from his chair with a white face and staring eyes.\n\n\"My boy! My boy!\"\n\n\"I am ruined, mother--ruined!\" He stood gazing wildly in front of him,\nwhile the sheet of paper fluttered down on the carpet. Then he dropped\nback into the chair, and sank his face into his hands. His mother\nhad her arms round him in an instant, while the Admiral, with shaking\nfingers, picked up the letter from the floor and adjusted his glasses to\nread it.\n\n\n\"My DEAR DENVER,\" it ran. \"By the time that this reaches you I shall\nbe out of the reach of yourself or of any one else who may desire an\ninterview. You need not search for me, for I assure you that this letter\nis posted by a friend, and that you will have your trouble in vain if\nyou try to find me. I am sorry to leave you in such a tight place, but\none or other of us must be squeezed, and on the whole I prefer that\nit should be you. You'll find nothing in the bank, and about L13,000\nunaccounted for. I'm not sure that the best thing you can do is not to\nrealize what you can, and imitate your senior's example. If you act at\nonce you may get clean away. If not, it's not only that you must put up\nyour shutters, but I am afraid that this missing money could hardly be\nincluded as an ordinary debt, and of course you are legally responsible\nfor it just as much as I am. Take a friend's advice and get to America.\nA young man with brains can always do something out there, and you can\nlive down this little mischance. It will be a cheap lesson if it teaches\nyou to take nothing upon trust in business, and to insist upon knowing\nexactly what your partner is doing, however senior he may be to you.\n\n\"Yours faithfully,\n\n\"JEREMIAH PEARSON.\"\n\n\n\"Great Heavens!\" groaned the Admiral, \"he has absconded.\"\n\n\"And left me both a bankrupt and a thief.\"\n\n\"No, no, Harold,\" sobbed his mother. \"All will be right. What matter\nabout money!\"\n\n\"Money, mother! It is my honor.\"\n\n\"The boy is right. It is his honor, and my honor, for his is mine. This\nis a sore trouble, mother, when we thought our life's troubles were all\nbehind us, but we will bear it as we have borne others.\" He held out\nhis stringy hand, and the two old folk sat with bowed grey heads, their\nfingers intertwined, strong in each other's love and sympathy.\n\n\"We were too happy,\" she sighed.\n\n\"But it is God's will, mother.\"\n\n\"Yes, John, it is God's will.\"\n\n\"And yet it is bitter to bear. I could have lost all, the house, money,\nrank--I could have borne it. But at my age--my honor--the honor of an\nadmiral of the fleet.\"\n\n\"No honor can be lost, John, where no dishonor has been done. What have\nyou done? What has Harold done? There is no question of honor.\"\n\nThe old man shook his head, but Harold had already called together his\nclear practical sense, which for an instant in the presence of this\nfrightful blow had deserted him.\n\n\"The mater is right, dad,\" said he. \"It is bad enough, Heaven knows, but\nwe must not take too dark a view of it. After all, this insolent letter\nis in itself evidence that I had nothing to do with the schemes of the\nbase villain who wrote it.\"\n\n\"They may think it prearranged.\"\n\n\"They could not. My whole life cries out against the thought. They could\nnot look me in the face and entertain it.\"\n\n\"No, boy, not if they have eyes in their heads,\" cried the Admiral,\nplucking up courage at the sight of the flashing eyes and brave, defiant\nface. \"We have the letter, and we have your character. We'll weather it\nyet between them. It's my fault from the beginning for choosing such a\nland-shark for your consort. God help me, I thought I was finding such\nan opening for you.\"\n\n\"Dear dad! How could you possibly know? As he says in his letter, it\nhas given me a lesson. But he was so much older and so much more\nexperienced, that it was hard for me to ask to examine his books. But we\nmust waste no time. I must go to the City.\"\n\n\"What will you do?\"\n\n\"What an honest man should do. I will write to all our clients and\ncreditors, assemble them, lay the whole matter before them, read them\nthe letter and put myself absolutely in their hands.\"\n\n\"That's it, boy--yard-arm to yard-arm, and have it over.\"\n\n\"I must go at once.\" He put on his top-coat and his hat. \"But I have ten\nminutes yet before I can catch a train. There is one little thing which\nI must do before I start.\"\n\nHe had caught sight through the long glass folding door of the gleam of\na white blouse and a straw hat in the tennis ground. Clara used often\nto meet him there of a morning to say a few words before he hurried away\ninto the City. He walked out now with the quick, firm step of a man who\nhas taken a momentous resolution, but his face was haggard and his lips\npale.\n\n\"Clara,\" said he, as she came towards him with words of greeting, \"I am\nsorry to bring ill news to you, but things have gone wrong in the City,\nand--and I think that I ought to release you from your engagement.\"\n\nClara stared at him with her great questioning dark eyes, and her face\nbecame as pale as his.\n\n\"How can the City affect you and me, Harold?\"\n\n\"It is dishonor. I cannot ask you to share it.\"\n\n\"Dishonor! The loss of some miserable gold and silver coins!\"\n\n\"Oh, Clara, if it were only that! We could be far happier together in\na little cottage in the country than with all the riches of the City.\nPoverty could not cut me to the heart, as I have been cut this morning.\nWhy, it is but twenty minutes since I had the letter, Clara, and it\nseems to me to be some old, old thing which happened far away in my past\nlife, some horrid black cloud which shut out all the freshness and the\npeace from it.\"\n\n\"But what is it, then? What do you fear worse than poverty?\"\n\n\"To have debts that I cannot meet. To be hammered upon 'Change and\ndeclared a bankrupt. To know that others have a just claim upon me\nand to feel that I dare not meet their eyes. Is not that worse than\npoverty?\"\n\n\"Yes, Harold, a thousand fold worse! But all this may be got over. Is\nthere nothing more?\"\n\n\"My partner has fled and left me responsible for heavy debts, and in\nsuch a position that I may be required by the law to produce some at\nleast of this missing money. It has been confided to him to invest, and\nhe has embezzled it. I, as his partner, am liable for it. I have brought\nmisery on all whom I love--my father, my mother. But you at least shall\nnot be under the shadow. You are free, Clara. There is no tie between\nus.\"\n\n\"It takes two to make such a tie, Harold,\" said she, smiling and putting\nher hand inside his arm. \"It takes two to make it, dear, and also two to\nbreak it. Is that the way they do business in the City, sir, that a man\ncan always at his own sweet will tear up his engagement?\"\n\n\"You hold me to it, Clara?\"\n\n\"No creditor so remorseless as I, Harold. Never, never shall you get\nfrom that bond.\"\n\n\"But I am ruined. My whole life is blasted.\"\n\n\"And so you wish to ruin me, and blast my life also. No indeed, sir, you\nshall not get away so lightly. But seriously now, Harold, you would hurt\nme if it were not so absurd. Do you think that a woman's love is like\nthis sunshade which I carry in my hand, a thing only fitted for the\nsunshine, and of no use when the winds blow and the clouds gather?\"\n\n\"I would not drag you down, Clara.\"\n\n\"Should I not be dragged down indeed if I left your side at such a time?\nIt is only now that I can be of use to you, help you, sustain you. You\nhave always been so strong, so above me. You are strong still, but then\ntwo will be stronger. Besides, sir, you have no idea what a woman of\nbusiness I am. Papa says so, and he knows.\"\n\nHarold tried to speak, but his heart was too full. He could only press\nthe white hand which curled round his sleeve. She walked up and down\nby his side, prattling merrily, and sending little gleams of cheeriness\nthrough the gloom which girt him in. To listen to her he might have\nthought that it was Ida, and not her staid and demure sister, who was\nchatting to him.\n\n\"It will soon be cleared up,\" she said, \"and then we shall feel quite\ndull. Of course all business men have these little ups and downs. Why,\nI suppose of all the men you meet upon 'Change, there is not one who has\nnot some such story to tell. If everything was always smooth, you know,\nthen of course every one would turn stockbroker, and you would have to\nhold your meetings in Hyde Park. How much is it that you need?\"\n\n\"More than I can ever get. Not less than thirteen thousand pounds.\"\n\nClara's face fell as she heard the amount. \"What do you purpose doing?\"\n\n\"I shall go to the City now, and I shall ask all our creditors to meet\nme to-morrow. I shall read them Pearson's letter, and put myself into\ntheir hands.\"\n\n\"And they, what will they do?\"\n\n\"What can they do? They will serve writs for their money, and the firm\nwill be declared bankrupt.\"\n\n\"And the meeting will be to-morrow, you say. Will you take my advice?\"\n\n\"What is it, Clara?\"\n\n\"To ask them for a few days of delay. Who knows what new turn matters\nmay take?\"\n\n\"What turn can they take? I have no means of raising the money.\"\n\n\"Let us have a few days.\"\n\n\"Oh, we should have that in the ordinary course of business. The legal\nformalities would take them some little time. But I must go, Clara, I\nmust not seem to shirk. My place now must be at my offices.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear, you are right. God bless you and guard you! I shall be\nhere in The Wilderness, but all day I shall be by your office table at\nThrogmorton Street in spirit, and if ever you should be sad you will\nhear my little whisper in your ear, and know that there is one client\nwhom you will never be able to get rid of--never as long as we both\nlive, dear.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. FRIENDS IN NEED.\n\n\n\"Now, papa,\" said Clara that morning, wrinkling her brows and putting\nher finger-tips together with the air of an experienced person of\nbusiness, \"I want to have a talk to you about money matters.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear.\" He laid down his paper, and looked a question.\n\n\"Kindly tell me again, papa, how much money I have in my very own right.\nYou have often told me before, but I always forget figures.\"\n\n\"You have two hundred and fifty pounds a year of your own, under your\naunt's will.\n\n\"And Ida?\"\n\n\"Ida has one hundred and fifty.\"\n\n\"Now, I think I can live very well on fifty pounds a year, papa. I\nam not very extravagant, and I could make my own dresses if I had a\nsewing-machine.\"\n\n\"Very likely, dear.\"\n\n\"In that case I have two hundred a year which I could do without.\"\n\n\"If it were necessary.\"\n\n\"But it is necessary. Oh, do help me, like a good, dear, kind papa, in\nthis matter, for my whole heart is set upon it. Harold is in sore need\nof money, and through no fault of his own.\" With a woman's tact and\neloquence, she told the whole story. \"Put yourself in my place, papa.\nWhat is the money to me? I never think of it from year's end to year's\nend. But now I know how precious it is. I could not have thought that\nmoney could be so valuable. See what I can do with it. It may help to\nsave him. I must have it by to-morrow. Oh, do, do advise me as to what I\nshould do, and how I should get the money.\"\n\nThe Doctor smiled at her eagerness. \"You are as anxious to get rid of\nmoney as others are to gain it,\" said he. \"In another case I might think\nit rash, but I believe in your Harold, and I can see that he has had\nvillainous treatment. You will let me deal with the matter.\"\n\n\"You, papa?\"\n\n\"It can be done best between men. Your capital, Clara, is some five\nthousand pounds, but it is out on a mortgage, and you could not call it\nin.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear! oh, dear!\"\n\n\"But we can still manage. I have as much at my bank. I will advance it\nto the Denvers as coming from you, and you can repay it to me, or the\ninterest of it, when your money becomes due.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is beautiful! How sweet and kind of you!\"\n\n\"But there is one obstacle: I do not think that you would ever induce\nHarold to take this money.\"\n\nClara's face fell. \"Don't you think so, really?\"\n\n\"I am sure that he would not.\"\n\n\"Then what are you to do? What horrid things money matters are to\narrange!\"\n\n\"I shall see his father. We can manage it all between us.\"\n\n\"Oh, do, do, papa! And you will do it soon?\"\n\n\"There is no time like the present. I will go in at once.\" He scribbled\na cheque, put it in an envelope, put on his broad straw hat, and\nstrolled in through the garden to pay his morning call.\n\nIt was a singular sight which met his eyes as he entered the\nsitting-room of the Admiral. A great sea chest stood open in the center,\nand all round upon the carpet were little piles of jerseys, oil-skins,\nbooks, sextant boxes, instruments, and sea-boots. The old seaman sat\ngravely amidst this lumber, turning it over, and examining it intently;\nwhile his wife, with the tears running silently down her ruddy cheeks,\nsat upon the sofa, her elbows upon her knees and her chin upon her\nhands, rocking herself slowly backwards and forwards.\n\n\"Hullo, Doctor,\" said the Admiral, holding out his hand, \"there's foul\nweather set in upon us, as you may have heard, but I have ridden out\nmany a worse squall, and, please God, we shall all three of us weather\nthis one also, though two of us are a little more cranky than we were.\"\n\n\"My dear friends, I came in to tell you how deeply we sympathize with\nyou all. My girl has only just told me about it.\"\n\n\"It has come so suddenly upon us, Doctor,\" sobbed Mrs. Hay Denver. \"I\nthought that I had John to myself for the rest of our lives--Heaven\nknows that we have not seen very much of each other--but now he talks of\ngoing to sea again.\n\n\"Aye, aye, Walker, that's the only way out of it. When I first heard of\nit I was thrown up in the wind with all aback. I give you my word that\nI lost my bearings more completely than ever since I strapped a middy's\ndirk to my belt. You see, friend, I know something of shipwreck or\nbattle or whatever may come upon the waters, but the shoals in the City\nof London on which my poor boy has struck are clean beyond me. Pearson\nhad been my pilot there, and now I know him to be a rogue. But I've\ntaken my bearings now, and I see my course right before me.\"\n\n\"What then, Admiral?\"\n\n\"Oh, I have one or two little plans. I'll have some news for the boy.\nWhy, hang it, Walker man, I may be a bit stiff in the joints, but you'll\nbe my witness that I can do my twelve miles under the three hours. What\nthen? My eyes are as good as ever except just for the newspaper. My head\nis clear. I'm three-and-sixty, but I'm as good a man as ever I was--too\ngood a man to lie up for another ten years. I'd be the better for a\nsmack of the salt water again, and a whiff of the breeze. Tut, mother,\nit's not a four years' cruise this time. I'll be back every month or\ntwo. It's no more than if I went for a visit in the country.\" He was\ntalking boisterously, and heaping his sea-boots and sextants back into\nhis chest.\n\n\"And you really think, my dear friend, of hoisting your pennant again?\"\n\n\"My pennant, Walker? No, no. Her Majesty, God bless her, has too many\nyoung men to need an old hulk like me. I should be plain Mr. Hay Denver,\nof the merchant service. I daresay that I might find some owner who\nwould give me a chance as second or third officer. It will be strange to\nme to feel the rails of the bridge under my fingers once more.\"\n\n\"Tut! tut! this will never do, this will never do, Admiral!\" The Doctor\nsat down by Mrs. Hay Denver and patted her hand in token of friendly\nsympathy. \"We must wait until your son has had it out with all these\npeople, and then we shall know what damage is done, and how best to set\nit right. It will be time enough then to begin to muster our resources\nto meet it.\"\n\n\"Our resources!\" The Admiral laughed. \"There's the pension. I'm afraid,\nWalker, that our resources won't need much mustering.\"\n\n\"Oh, come, there are some which you may not have thought of. For\nexample, Admiral, I had always intended that my girl should have five\nthousand from me when she married. Of course your boy's trouble is her\ntrouble, and the money cannot be spent better than in helping to set it\nright. She has a little of her own which she wished to contribute, but\nI thought it best to work it this way. Will you take the cheque, Mrs.\nDenver, and I think it would be best if you said nothing to Harold about\nit, and just used it as the occasion served?\"\n\n\"God bless you, Walker, you are a true friend. I won't forget this,\nWalker.\" The Admiral sat down on his sea chest and mopped his brow with\nhis red handkerchief.\n\n\"What is it to me whether you have it now or then? It may be more useful\nnow. There's only one stipulation. If things should come to the worst,\nand if the business should prove so bad that nothing can set it right,\nthen hold back this cheque, for there is no use in pouring water into a\nbroken basin, and if the lad should fall, he will want something to pick\nhimself up again with.\"\n\n\"He shall not fall, Walker, and you shall not have occasion to be\nashamed of the family into which your daughter is about to marry. I\nhave my own plan. But we shall hold your money, my friend, and it will\nstrengthen us to feel that it is there.\"\n\n\"Well, that is all right,\" said Doctor Walker, rising. \"And if a little\nmore should be needed, we must not let him go wrong for the want of a\nthousand or two. And now, Admiral, I'm off for my morning walk. Won't\nyou come too?\"\n\n\"No, I am going into town.\"\n\n\"Well, good-bye. I hope to have better news, and that all will come\nright. Good-bye, Mrs. Denver. I feel as if the boy were my own, and I\nshall not be easy until all is right with him.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. IN STRANGE WATERS.\n\n\nWhen Doctor Walker had departed, the Admiral packed all his possessions\nback into his sea chest with the exception of one little brass-bound\ndesk. This he unlocked, and took from it a dozen or so blue sheets of\npaper all mottled over with stamps and seals, with very large V. R.'s\nprinted upon the heads of them. He tied these carefully into a small\nbundle, and placing them in the inner pocket of his coat, he seized his\nstick and hat.\n\n\"Oh, John, don't do this rash thing,\" cried Mrs. Denver, laying her\nhands upon his sleeve. \"I have seen so little of you, John. Only three\nyears since you left the service. Don't leave me again. I know it is\nweak of me, but I cannot bear it.\"\n\n\"There's my own brave lass,\" said he, smoothing down the grey-shot hair.\n\"We've lived in honor together, mother, and please God in honor we'll\ndie. No matter how debts are made, they have got to be met, and what\nthe boy owes we owe. He has not the money, and how is he to find it? He\ncan't find it. What then? It becomes my business, and there's only one\nway for it.\"\n\n\"But it may not be so very bad, John. Had we not best wait until after\nhe sees these people to-morrow?\"\n\n\"They may give him little time, lass. But I'll have a care that I don't\ngo so far that I can't put back again. Now, mother, there's no use\nholding me. It's got to be done, and there's no sense in shirking it.\"\nHe detached her fingers from his sleeve, pushed her gently back into an\narm-chair, and hurried from the house.\n\nIn less than half an hour the Admiral was whirled into Victoria Station\nand found himself amid a dense bustling throng, who jostled and pushed\nin the crowded terminus. His errand, which had seemed feasible enough in\nhis own room, began now to present difficulties in the carrying out, and\nhe puzzled over how he should take the first steps. Amid the stream of\nbusiness men, each hurrying on his definite way, the old seaman in his\ngrey tweed suit and black soft hat strode slowly along, his head sunk\nand his brow wrinkled in perplexity. Suddenly an idea occurred to him.\nHe walked back to the railway stall and bought a daily paper. This he\nturned and turned until a certain column met his eye, when he smoothed\nit out, and carrying it over to a seat, proceeded to read it at his\nleisure.\n\nAnd, indeed, as a man read that column, it seemed strange to him that\nthere should still remain any one in this world of ours who should be in\nstraits for want of money. Here were whole lines of gentlemen who were\nburdened with a surplus in their incomes, and who were loudly calling\nto the poor and needy to come and take it off their hands. Here was the\nguileless person who was not a professional moneylender, but who would\nbe glad to correspond, etc. Here too was the accommodating individual\nwho advanced sums from ten to ten thousand pounds without expense,\nsecurity, or delay. \"The money actually paid over within a few hours,\"\nran this fascinating advertisement, conjuring up a vision of swift\nmessengers rushing with bags of gold to the aid of the poor struggler. A\nthird gentleman did all business by personal application, advanced money\non anything or nothing; the lightest and airiest promise was enough to\ncontent him according to his circular, and finally he never asked\nfor more than five per cent. This struck the Admiral as far the most\npromising, and his wrinkles relaxed, and his frown softened away as\nhe gazed at it. He folded up the paper rose from the seat, and found\nhimself face to face with Charles Westmacott.\n\n\"Hullo, Admiral!\"\n\n\"Hullo, Westmacott!\" Charles had always been a favorite of the seaman's.\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Oh, I have been doing a little business for my aunt. But I have never\nseen you in London before.\"\n\n\"I hate the place. It smothers me. There's not a breath of clean air on\nthis side of Greenwich. But maybe you know your way about pretty well in\nthe City?\"\n\n\"Well, I know something about it. You see I've never lived very far from\nit, and I do a good deal of my aunt's business.\"\n\n\"Maybe you know Bread Street?\"\n\n\"It is out of Cheapside.\"\n\n\"Well then, how do you steer for it from here? You make me out a course\nand I'll keep to it.\"\n\n\"Why, Admiral, I have nothing to do. I'll take you there with pleasure.\"\n\n\"Will you, though? Well, I'd take it very kindly if you would. I have\nbusiness there. Smith and Hanbury, financial agents, Bread Street.\"\n\nThe pair made their way to the river-side, and so down the Thames to St.\nPaul's landing--a mode of travel which was much more to the Admiral's\ntaste than 'bus or cab. On the way, he told his companion his mission\nand the causes which had led to it. Charles Westmacott knew little\nenough of City life and the ways of business, but at least he had more\nexperience in both than the Admiral, and he made up his mind not to\nleave him until the matter was settled.\n\n\"These are the people,\" said the Admiral, twisting round his paper,\nand pointing to the advertisement which had seemed to him the most\npromising. \"It sounds honest and above-board, does it not? The personal\ninterview looks as if there were no trickery, and then no one could\nobject to five per cent.\"\n\n\"No, it seems fair enough.\"\n\n\"It is not pleasant to have to go hat in hand borrowing money, but there\nare times, as you may find before you are my age, Westmacott, when a man\nmust stow away his pride. But here's their number, and their plate is on\nthe corner of the door.\"\n\nA narrow entrance was flanked on either side by a row of brasses,\nranging upwards from the shipbrokers and the solicitors who occupied\nthe ground floors, through a long succession of West Indian agents,\narchitects, surveyors, and brokers, to the firm of which they were in\nquest. A winding stone stair, well carpeted and railed at first but\ngrowing shabbier with every landing, brought them past innumerable doors\nuntil, at last, just under the ground-glass roofing, the names of Smith\nand Hanbury were to be seen painted in large white letters across a\npanel, with a laconic invitation to push beneath it. Following out the\nsuggestion, the Admiral and his companion found themselves in a dingy\napartment, ill lit from a couple of glazed windows. An ink-stained\ntable, littered with pens, papers, and almanacs, an American cloth sofa,\nthree chairs of varying patterns, and a much-worn carpet, constituted\nall the furniture, save only a very large and obtrusive porcelain\nspittoon, and a gaudily framed and very somber picture which hung above\nthe fireplace. Sitting in front of this picture, and staring gloomily\nat it, as being the only thing which he could stare at, was a small\nsallow-faced boy with a large head, who in the intervals of his art\nstudies munched sedately at an apple.\n\n\"Is Mr. Smith or Mr. Hanbury in?\" asked the Admiral.\n\n\"There ain't no such people,\" said the small boy.\n\n\"But you have the names on the door.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is the name of the firm, you see. It's only a name. It's Mr.\nReuben Metaxa that you wants.\"\n\n\"Well then, is he in?\"\n\n\"No, he's not.\"\n\n\"When will he be back?\"\n\n\"Can't tell, I'm sure. He's gone to lunch. Sometimes he takes one hour,\nand sometimes two. It'll be two to-day, I 'spect, for he said he was\nhungry afore he went.\"\n\n\"Then I suppose that we had better call again,\" said the Admiral.\n\n\"Not a bit,\" cried Charles. \"I know how to manage these little imps. See\nhere, you young varmint, here's a shilling for you. Run off and fetch\nyour master. If you don't bring him here in five minutes I'll clump you\non the side of the head when you get back. Shoo! Scat!\" He charged at\nthe youth, who bolted from the room and clattered madly down-stairs.\n\n\"He'll fetch him,\" said Charles. \"Let us make ourselves at home.\nThis sofa does not feel over and above safe. It was not meant for\nfifteen-stone men. But this doesn't look quite the sort of place where\none would expect to pick up money.\"\n\n\"Just what I was thinking,\" said the Admiral, looking ruefully about\nhim.\n\n\"Ah, well! I have heard that the best furnished offices generally belong\nto the poorest firms. Let us hope it's the opposite here. They can't\nspend much on the management anyhow. That pumpkin-headed boy was the\nstaff, I suppose. Ha, by Jove, that's his voice, and he's got our man, I\nthink!\"\n\nAs he spoke the youth appeared in the doorway with a small, brown,\ndried-up little chip of a man at his heels. He was clean-shaven and\nblue-chinned, with bristling black hair, and keen brown eyes which shone\nout very brightly from between pouched under-lids and drooping upper\nones. He advanced, glancing keenly from one to the other of his\nvisitors, and slowly rubbing together his thin, blue-veined hands. The\nsmall boy closed the door behind him, and discreetly vanished.\n\n\"I am Mr. Reuben Metaxa,\" said the moneylender. \"Was it about an advance\nyou wished to see me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"For you, I presume?\" turning to Charles Westmacott.\n\n\"No, for this gentleman.\"\n\nThe moneylender looked surprised. \"How much did you desire?\"\n\n\"I thought of five thousand pounds,\" said the Admiral.\n\n\"And on what security?\"\n\n\"I am a retired admiral of the British navy. You will find my name in\nthe Navy List. There is my card. I have here my pension papers. I get\nL850 a year. I thought that perhaps if you were to hold these papers\nit would be security enough that I should pay you. You could draw my\npension, and repay yourselves at the rate, say, of L500 a year, taking\nyour five per cent interest as well.\"\n\n\"What interest?\"\n\n\"Five per cent per annum.\"\n\nMr. Metaxa laughed. \"Per annum!\" he said. \"Five per cent a month.\"\n\n\"A month! That would be sixty per cent a year.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"But that is monstrous.\"\n\n\"I don't ask gentlemen to come to me. They come of their own free will.\nThose are my terms, and they can take it or leave it.\"\n\n\"Then I shall leave it.\" The Admiral rose angrily from his chair.\n\n\"But one moment, sir. Just sit down and we shall chat the matter over.\nYours is a rather unusual case and we may find some other way of doing\nwhat you wish. Of course the security which you offer is no security at\nall, and no sane man would advance five thousand pennies on it.\"\n\n\"No security? Why not, sir?\"\n\n\"You might die to-morrow. You are not a young man. What age are you?\"\n\n\"Sixty-three.\"\n\nMr. Metaxa turned over a long column of figures. \"Here is an actuary's\ntable,\" said he. \"At your time of life the average expectancy of life is\nonly a few years even in a well-preserved man.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to insinuate that I am not a well-preserved man?\"\n\n\"Well, Admiral, it is a trying life at sea. Sailors in their younger\ndays are gay dogs, and take it out of themselves. Then when they grow\nolder they are still hard at it, and have no chance of rest or peace. I\ndo not think a sailor's life a good one.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what, sir,\" said the Admiral hotly. \"If you have two\npairs of gloves I'll undertake to knock you out under three rounds. Or\nI'll race you from here to St. Paul's, and my friend here will see fair.\nI'll let you see whether I am an old man or not.\"\n\n\"This is beside the question,\" said the moneylender with a deprecatory\nshrug. \"The point is that if you died to-morrow where would be the\nsecurity then?\"\n\n\"I could insure my life, and make the policy over to you.\"\n\n\"Your premiums for such a sum, if any office would have you, which I\nvery much doubt, would come to close on five hundred a year. That would\nhardly suit your book.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, what do you intend to propose?\" asked the Admiral.\n\n\"I might, to accommodate you, work it in another way. I should send for\na medical man, and have an opinion upon your life. Then I might see what\ncould be done.\"\n\n\"That is quite fair. I have no objection to that.\"\n\n\"There is a very clever doctor in the street here. Proudie is his name.\nJohn, go and fetch Doctor Proudie.\" The youth was dispatched upon\nhis errand, while Mr. Metaxa sat at his desk, trimming his nails, and\nshooting out little comments upon the weather. Presently feet were\nheard upon the stairs, the moneylender hurried out, there was a sound of\nwhispering, and he returned with a large, fat, greasy-looking man, clad\nin a much worn frock-coat, and a very dilapidated top hat.\n\n\"Doctor Proudie, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Metaxa.\n\nThe doctor bowed, smiled, whipped off his hat, and produced his\nstethoscope from its interior with the air of a conjurer upon the stage.\n\"Which of these gentlemen am I to examine?\" he asked, blinking from one\nto the other of them. \"Ah, it is you! Only your waistcoat! You need\nnot undo your collar. Thank you! A full breath! Thank you! Ninety-nine!\nThank you! Now hold your breath for a moment. Oh, dear, dear, what is\nthis I hear?\"\n\n\"What is it then?\" asked the Admiral coolly.\n\n\"Tut! tut! This is a great pity. Have you had rheumatic fever?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"You have had some serious illness?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Ah, you are an admiral. You have been abroad, tropics, malaria, ague--I\nknow.\"\n\n\"I have never had a day's illness.\"\n\n\"Not to your knowledge; but you have inhaled unhealthy air, and it has\nleft its effect. You have an organic murmur--slight but distinct.\"\n\n\"Is it dangerous?\"\n\n\"It might at anytime become so. You should not take violent exercise.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed. It would hurt me to run a half mile?\"\n\n\"It would be very dangerous.\"\n\n\"And a mile?\"\n\n\"Would be almost certainly fatal.\"\n\n\"Then there is nothing else the matter?\"\n\n\"No. But if the heart is weak, then everything is weak, and the life is\nnot a sound one.\"\n\n\"You see, Admiral,\" remarked Mr. Metaxa, as the doctor secreted his\nstethoscope once more in his hat, \"my remarks were not entirely uncalled\nfor. I am sorry that the doctor's opinion is not more favorable, but\nthis is a matter of business, and certain obvious precautions must be\ntaken.\"\n\n\"Of course. Then the matter is at an end.\"\n\n\"Well, we might even now do business. I am most anxious to be of use\nto you. How long do you think, doctor, that this gentleman will in all\nprobability live?\"\n\n\"Well, well, it's rather a delicate question to answer,\" said Dr.\nProudie, with a show of embarrassment.\n\n\"Not a bit, sir. Out with it! I have faced death too often to flinch\nfrom it now, though I saw it as near me as you are.\"\n\n\"Well, well, we must go by averages of course. Shall we say two years? I\nshould think that you have a full two years before you.\"\n\n\"In two years your pension would bring you in L1,600. Now I will do my\nvery best for you, Admiral! I will advance you L2,000, and you can make\nover to me your pension for your life. It is pure speculation on my\npart. If you die to-morrow I lose my money. If the doctor's prophecy\nis correct I shall still be out of pocket. If you live a little longer,\nthen I may see my money again. It is the very best I can do for you.\"\n\n\"Then you wish to buy my pension?\"\n\n\"Yes, for two thousand down.\"\n\n\"And if I live for twenty years?\"\n\n\"Oh, in that case of course my speculation would be more successful. But\nyou have heard the doctor's opinion.\"\n\n\"Would you advance the money instantly?\"\n\n\"You should have a thousand at once. The other thousand I should expect\nyou to take in furniture.\"\n\n\"In furniture?\"\n\n\"Yes, Admiral. We shall do you a beautiful houseful at that sum. It is\nthe custom of my clients to take half in furniture.\"\n\nThe Admiral sat in dire perplexity. He had come out to get money, and to\ngo back without any, to be powerless to help when his boy needed every\nshilling to save him from disaster, that would be very bitter to him. On\nthe other hand, it was so much that he surrendered, and so little that\nhe received. Little, and yet something. Would it not be better than\ngoing back empty-handed? He saw the yellow backed chequebook upon the\ntable. The moneylender opened it and dipped his pen into the ink.\n\n\"Shall I fill it up?\" said he.\n\n\"I think, Admiral,\" remarked Westmacott, \"that we had better have a\nlittle walk and some luncheon before we settle this matter.\"\n\n\"Oh, we may as well do it at once. It would be absurd to postpone it\nnow,\" Metaxa spoke with some heat, and his eyes glinted angrily from\nbetween his narrow lids at the imperturbable Charles. The Admiral was\nsimple in money matters, but he had seen much of men and had learned\nto read them. He saw that venomous glance, and saw too that intense\neagerness was peeping out from beneath the careless air which the agent\nhad assumed.\n\n\"You're quite right, Westmacott,\" said he. \"We'll have a little walk\nbefore we settle it.\"\n\n\"But I may not be here this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Then we must choose another day.\"\n\n\"But why not settle it now?\"\n\n\"Because I prefer not,\" said the Admiral shortly.\n\n\"Very well. But remember that my offer is only for to-day. It is off\nunless you take it at once.\"\n\n\"Let it be off, then.\"\n\n\"There's my fee,\" cried the doctor.\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"A guinea.\"\n\nThe Admiral threw a pound and a shilling upon the table. \"Come,\nWestmacott,\" said he, and they walked together from the room.\n\n\"I don't like it,\" said Charles, when they found themselves in the\nstreet once more; \"I don't profess to be a very sharp chap, but this is\na trifle too thin. What did he want to go out and speak to the doctor\nfor? And how very convenient this tale of a weak heart was! I believe\nthey are a couple of rogues, and in league with each other.\"\n\n\"A shark and a pilot fish,\" said the Admiral.\n\n\"I'll tell you what I propose, sir. There's a lawyer named McAdam who\ndoes my aunt's business. He is a very honest fellow, and lives at\nthe other side of Poultry. We'll go over to him together and have his\nopinion about the whole matter.\"\n\n\"How far is it to his place?\"\n\n\"Oh, a mile at least. We can have a cab.\"\n\n\"A mile? Then we shall see if there is any truth in what that swab of\na doctor said. Come, my boy, and clap on all sail, and see who can stay\nthe longest.\"\n\nThen the sober denizens of the heart of business London saw a singular\nsight as they returned from their luncheons. Down the roadway, dodging\namong cabs and carts, ran a weather-stained elderly man, with wide\nflapping black hat, and homely suit of tweeds. With elbows braced back,\nhands clenched near his armpits, and chest protruded, he scudded\nalong, while close at his heels lumbered a large-limbed, heavy, yellow\nmustached young man, who seemed to feel the exercise a good deal more\nthan his senior. On they dashed, helter-skelter, until they pulled up\npanting at the office where the lawyer of the Westmacotts was to be\nfound.\n\n\"There now!\" cried the Admiral in triumph. \"What d'ye think of that?\nNothing wrong in the engine-room, eh?\"\n\n\"You seem fit enough, sir.\"\n\n\"Blessed if I believe the swab was a certificated doctor at all. He was\nflying false colors, or I am mistaken.\"\n\n\"They keep the directories and registers in this eating-house,\" said\nWestmacott. \"We'll go and look him out.\"\n\nThey did so, but the medical rolls contained no such name as that of Dr.\nProudie, of Bread Street.\n\n\"Pretty villainy this!\" cried the Admiral, thumping his chest. \"A\ndummy doctor and a vamped up disease. Well, we've tried the rogues,\nWestmacott! Let us see what we can do with your honest man.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. EASTWARD HO!\n\n\nMr. McAdam, of the firm of McAdam and Squire, was a highly polished man\nwho dwelt behind a highly polished table in the neatest and snuggest\nof offices. He was white-haired and amiable, with a deep-lined aquiline\nface, was addicted to low bows, and indeed, always seemed to carry\nhimself at half-cock, as though just descending into one, or just\nrecovering himself. He wore a high-buckled stock, took snuff, and\nadorned his conversation with little scraps from the classics.\n\n\"My dear Sir,\" said he, when he had listened to their story, \"any friend\nof Mrs. Westmacott's is a friend of mine. Try a pinch. I wonder that\nyou should have gone to this man Metaxa. His advertisement is enough to\ncondemn him. Habet foenum in cornu. They are all rogues.\"\n\n\"The doctor was a rogue too. I didn't like the look of him at the time.\"\n\n\"Arcades ambo. But now we must see what we can do for you. Of course\nwhat Metaxa said was perfectly right. The pension is in itself no\nsecurity at all, unless it were accompanied by a life assurance which\nwould be an income in itself. It is no good whatever.\"\n\nHis clients' faces fell.\n\n\"But there is the second alternative. You might sell the pension right\nout. Speculative investors occasionally deal in such things. I have one\nclient, a sporting man, who would be very likely to take it up if we\ncould agree upon terms. Of course, I must follow Metaxa's example by\nsending for a doctor.\"\n\nFor the second time was the Admiral punched and tapped and listened to.\nThis time, however, there could be no question of the qualifications\nof the doctor, a well-known Fellow of the College of Surgeons, and his\nreport was as favorable as the other's had been adverse.\n\n\"He has the heart and chest of a man of forty,\" said he. \"I can\nrecommend his life as one of the best of his age that I have ever\nexamined.\"\n\n\"That's well,\" said Mr. McAdam, making a note of the doctor's remarks,\nwhile the Admiral disbursed a second guinea. \"Your price, I understand,\nis five thousand pounds. I can communicate with Mr. Elberry, my client,\nand let you know whether he cares to touch the matter. Meanwhile you can\nleave your pension papers here, and I will give you a receipt for them.\"\n\n\"Very well. I should like the money soon.\"\n\n\"That is why I am retaining the papers. If I can see Mr. Elberry to-day\nwe may let you have a cheque to-morrow. Try another pinch. No? Well,\ngood-bye. I am very happy to have been of service.\" Mr. McAdam bowed\nthem out, for he was a very busy man, and they found themselves in the\nstreet once more with lighter hearts than when they had left it.\n\n\"Well, Westmacott, I am sure I am very much obliged to you,\" said the\nAdmiral. \"You have stood by me when I was the better for a little help,\nfor I'm clean out of my soundings among these city sharks. But I've\nsomething to do now which is more in my own line, and I need not trouble\nyou any more.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is no trouble. I have nothing to do. I never have anything to\ndo. I don't suppose I could do it if I had. I should be delighted to\ncome with you, sir, if I can be of any use.\"\n\n\"No, no, my lad. You go home again. It would be kind of you, though, if\nyou would look in at number one when you get back and tell my wife that\nall's well with me, and that I'll be back in an hour or so.\"\n\n\"All right, sir. I'll tell her.\" Westmacott raised his hat and strode\naway to the westward, while the Admiral, after a hurried lunch, bent his\nsteps towards the east.\n\nIt was a long walk, but the old seaman swung along at a rousing pace,\nleaving street after street behind him. The great business places\ndwindled down into commonplace shops and dwellings, which decreased and\nbecame more stunted, even as the folk who filled them did, until he was\ndeep in the evil places of the eastern end. It was a land of huge,\ndark houses and of garish gin-shops, a land, too, where life moves\nirregularly and where adventures are to be gained--as the Admiral was to\nlearn to his cost.\n\nHe was hurrying down one of the long, narrow, stone-flagged lanes\nbetween the double lines of crouching, disheveled women and of dirty\nchildren who sat on the hollowed steps of the houses, and basked in\nthe autumn sun. At one side was a barrowman with a load of walnuts, and\nbeside the barrow a bedraggled woman with a black fringe and a chequered\nshawl thrown over her head. She was cracking walnuts and picking them\nout of the shells, throwing out a remark occasionally to a rough man in\na rabbit-skin cap, with straps under the knees of his corduroy trousers,\nwho stood puffing a black clay pipe with his back against the wall. What\nthe cause of the quarrel was, or what sharp sarcasm from the woman's\nlips pricked suddenly through that thick skin may never be known, but\nsuddenly the man took his pipe in his left hand, leaned forward, and\ndeliberately struck her across the face with his right. It was a slap\nrather than a blow, but the woman gave a sharp cry and cowered up\nagainst the barrow with her hand to her cheek.\n\n\"You infernal villain!\" cried the Admiral, raising his stick. \"You brute\nand blackguard!\"\n\n\"Garn!\" growled the rough, with the deep rasping intonation of a savage.\n\"Garn out o' this or I'll----\" He took a step forward with uplifted\nhand, but in an instant down came cut number three upon his wrist, and\ncut number five across his thigh, and cut number one full in the center\nof his rabbit-skin cap. It was not a heavy stick, but it was strong\nenough to leave a good red weal wherever it fell. The rough yelled\nwith pain, and rushed in, hitting with both hands, and kicking with his\nironshod boots, but the Admiral had still a quick foot and a true eye,\nso that he bounded backwards and sideways, still raining a shower of\nblows upon his savage antagonist. Suddenly, however, a pair of arms\nclosed round his neck, and glancing backwards he caught a glimpse of the\nblack coarse fringe of the woman whom he had befriended. \"I've got him!\"\nshe shrieked. \"I'll 'old 'im. Now, Bill, knock the tripe out of him!\"\nHer grip was as strong as a man's, and her wrist pressed like an iron\nbar upon the Admiral's throat. He made a desperate effort to disengage\nhimself, but the most that he could do was to swing her round, so as to\nplace her between his adversary and himself. As it proved, it was the\nvery best thing that he could have done. The rough, half-blinded and\nmaddened by the blows which he had received, struck out with all his\nungainly strength, just as his partner's head swung round in front\nof him. There was a noise like that of a stone hitting a wall, a\ndeep groan, her grasp relaxed, and she dropped a dead weight upon the\npavement, while the Admiral sprang back and raised his stick once more,\nready either for attack or defense. Neither were needed, however, for\nat that moment there was a scattering of the crowd, and two police\nconstables, burly and helmeted, pushed their way through the rabble.\nAt the sight of them the rough took to his heels, and was instantly\nscreened from view by a veil of his friends and neighbors.\n\n\"I have been assaulted,\" panted the Admiral. \"This woman was attacked\nand I had to defend her.\"\n\n\"This is Bermondsey Sal,\" said one police officer, bending over the\nbedraggled heap of tattered shawl and dirty skirt. \"She's got it hot\nthis time.\"\n\n\"He was a shortish man, thick, with a beard.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's Black Davie. He's been up four times for beating her. He's\nabout done the job now. If I were you I would let that sort settle their\nown little affairs, sir.\"\n\n\"Do you think that a man who holds the Queen's commission will stand by\nand see a woman struck?\" cried the Admiral indignantly.\n\n\"Well, just as you like, sir. But you've lost your watch, I see.\"\n\n\"My watch!\" He clapped his hand to his waistcoat. The chain was hanging\ndown in front, and the watch gone.\n\nHe passed his hand over his forehead. \"I would not have lost that watch\nfor anything,\" said he. \"No money could replace it. It was given me by\nthe ship's company after our African cruise. It has an inscription.\"\n\nThe policeman shrugged his shoulders. \"It comes from meddling,\" said he.\n\n\"What'll you give me if I tell yer where it is?\" said a sharp-faced boy\namong the crowd. \"Will you gimme a quid?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Well, where's the quid?\"\n\nThe Admiral took a sovereign from his pocket. \"Here it is.\"\n\n\"Then 'ere's the ticker!\" The boy pointed to the clenched hand of the\nsenseless woman. A glimmer of gold shone out from between the fingers,\nand on opening them up, there was the Admiral's chronometer. This\ninteresting victim had throttled her protector with one hand, while she\nhad robbed him with the other.\n\nThe Admiral left his address with the policeman, satisfied that the\nwoman was only stunned, not dead, and then set off upon his way once\nmore, the poorer perhaps in his faith in human nature, but in very good\nspirits none the less. He walked with dilated nostrils and clenched\nhands, all glowing and tingling with the excitement of the combat, and\nwarmed with the thought that he could still, when there was need, take\nhis own part in a street brawl in spite of his three-score and odd\nyears.\n\nHis way now led towards the river-side regions, and a cleansing whiff\nof tar was to be detected in the stagnant autumn air. Men with the blue\njersey and peaked cap of the boatman, or the white ducks of the dockers,\nbegan to replace the corduroys and fustian of the laborers. Shops with\nnautical instruments in the windows, rope and paint sellers, and slop\nshops with long rows of oilskins dangling from hooks, all proclaimed\nthe neighborhood of the docks. The Admiral quickened his pace and\nstraightened his figure as his surroundings became more nautical, until\nat last, peeping between two high, dingy wharfs, he caught a glimpse of\nthe mud-colored waters of the Thames, and of the bristle of masts\nand funnels which rose from its broad bosom. To the right lay a quiet\nstreet, with many brass plates upon either side, and wire blinds in\nall of the windows. The Admiral walked slowly down it until \"The Saint\nLawrence Shipping Company\" caught his eye. He crossed the road, pushed\nopen the door, and found himself in a low-ceilinged office, with a long\ncounter at one end and a great number of wooden sections of ships stuck\nupon boards and plastered all over the walls.\n\n\"Is Mr. Henry in?\" asked the Admiral.\n\n\"No, sir,\" answered an elderly man from a high seat in the corner. \"He\nhas not come into town to-day. I can manage any business you may wish\nseen to.\"\n\n\"You don't happen to have a first or second officer's place vacant, do\nyou?\"\n\nThe manager looked with a dubious eye at his singular applicant.\n\n\"Do you hold certificates?\" he asked.\n\n\"I hold every nautical certificate there is.\"\n\n\"Then you won't do for us.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Your age, sir.\"\n\n\"I give you my word that I can see as well as ever, and am as good a man\nin every way.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt it.\"\n\n\"Why should my age be a bar, then?\"\n\n\"Well, I must put it plainly. If a man of your age, holding\ncertificates, has not got past a second officer's berth, there must be\na black mark against him somewhere. I don't know what it is, drink or\ntemper, or want of judgment, but something there must be.\"\n\n\"I assure you there is nothing, but I find myself stranded, and so have\nto turn to the old business again.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's it,\" said the manager, with suspicion in his eye. \"How long\nwere you in your last billet?\"\n\n\"Fifty-one years.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, one-and-fifty years.\"\n\n\"In the same employ?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why, you must have begun as a child.\"\n\n\"I was twelve when I joined.\"\n\n\"It must be a strangely managed business,\" said the manager, \"which\nallows men to leave it who have served for fifty years, and who are\nstill as good as ever. Who did you serve?\"\n\n\"The Queen. Heaven bless her!\"\n\n\"Oh, you were in the Royal Navy. What rating did you hold?\"\n\n\"I am Admiral of the Fleet.\"\n\nThe manager started, and sprang down from his high stool.\n\n\"My name is Admiral Hay Denver. There is my card. And here are the\nrecords of my service. I don't, you understand, want to push another man\nfrom his billet; but if you should chance to have a berth open, I should\nbe very glad of it. I know the navigation from the Cod Banks right up to\nMontreal a great deal better than I know the streets of London.\"\n\nThe astonished manager glanced over the blue papers which his visitor\nhad handed him. \"Won't you take a chair, Admiral?\" said he.\n\n\"Thank you! But I should be obliged if you would drop my title now. I\ntold you because you asked me, but I've left the quarter-deck, and I am\nplain Mr. Hay Denver now.\"\n\n\"May I ask,\" said the manager, \"are you the same Denver who commanded at\none time on the North American station?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Then it was you who got one of our boats, the Comus, off the rocks\nin the Bay of Fundy? The directors voted you three hundred guineas as\nsalvage, and you refused them.\"\n\n\"It was an offer which should not have been made,\" said the Admiral\nsternly.\n\n\"Well, it reflects credit upon you that you should think so. If Mr.\nHenry were here I am sure that he would arrange this matter for you at\nonce. As it is, I shall lay it before the directors to-day, and I am\nsure that they will be proud to have you in our employment, and, I hope,\nin some more suitable position than that which you suggest.\"\n\n\"I am very much obliged to you, sir,\" said the Admiral, and started off\nagain, well pleased, upon his homeward journey.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. STILL AMONG SHOALS.\n\n\nNext day brought the Admiral a cheque for L5,000 from Mr. McAdam, and\na stamped agreement by which he made over his pension papers to the\nspeculative investor. It was not until he had signed and sent it off\nthat the full significance of all that he had done broke upon him. He\nhad sacrificed everything. His pension was gone. He had nothing save\nonly what he could earn. But the stout old heart never quailed. He\nwaited eagerly for a letter from the Saint Lawrence Shipping Company,\nand in the meanwhile he gave his landlord a quarter's notice. Hundred\npound a year houses would in future be a luxury which he could not\naspire to. A small lodging in some inexpensive part of London must be\nthe substitute for his breezy Norwood villa. So be it, then! Better that\na thousand fold than that his name should be associated with failure and\ndisgrace.\n\nOn that morning Harold Denver was to meet the creditors of the firm,\nand to explain the situation to them. It was a hateful task, a degrading\ntask, but he set himself to do it with quiet resolution. At home they\nwaited in intense anxiety to learn the result of the meeting. It was\nlate before he returned, haggard and pale, like a man who has done and\nsuffered much.\n\n\"What's this board in front of the house?\" he asked.\n\n\"We are going to try a little change of scene,\" said the Admiral. \"This\nplace is neither town nor country. But never mind that, boy. Tell us\nwhat happened in the City.\"\n\n\"God help me! My wretched business driving you out of house and home!\"\ncried Harold, broken down by this fresh evidence of the effects of his\nmisfortunes. \"It is easier for me to meet my creditors than to see you\ntwo suffering so patiently for my sake.\"\n\n\"Tut, tut!\" cried the Admiral. \"There's no suffering in the matter.\nMother would rather be near the theaters. That's at the bottom of it,\nisn't it, mother? You come and sit down here between us and tell us all\nabout it.\"\n\nHarold sat down with a loving hand in each of his.\n\n\"It's not so bad as we thought,\" said he, \"and yet it is bad enough.\nI have about ten days to find the money, but I don't know which way to\nturn for it. Pearson, however, lied, as usual, when he spoke of L13,000.\nThe amount is not quite L7,000.\"\n\nThe Admiral claped his hands. \"I knew we should weather it after all!\nHurrah my boy! Hip, hip, hip, hurrah!\"\n\nHarold gazed at him in surprise, while the old seaman waved his arm\nabove his head and bellowed out three stentorian cheers. \"Where am I to\nget seven thousand pounds from, dad?\" he asked.\n\n\"Never mind. You spin your yarn.\"\n\n\"Well, they were very good and very kind, but of course they must\nhave either their money or their money's worth. They passed a vote\nof sympathy with me, and agreed to wait ten days before they took any\nproceedings. Three of them, whose claim came to L3,500, told me that if\nI would give them my personal I.O.U., and pay interest at the rate of\nfive per cent, their amounts might stand over as long as I wished. That\nwould be a charge of L175 upon my income, but with economy I could meet\nit, and it diminishes the debt by one-half.\"\n\nAgain the Admiral burst out cheering.\n\n\"There remains, therefore, about L3,200 which has to be found within ten\ndays. No man shall lose by me. I gave them my word in the room that if I\nworked my soul out of my body every one of them should be paid. I shall\nnot spend a penny upon myself until it is done. But some of them can't\nwait. They are poor men themselves, and must have their money. They have\nissued a warrant for Pearson's arrest. But they think that he has got\naway to the States.\"\n\n\"These men shall have their money,\" said the Admiral.\n\n\"Dad!\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy, you don't know the resources of the family. One never does\nknow until one tries. What have you yourself now?\"\n\n\"I have about a thousand pounds invested.\"\n\n\"All right. And I have about as much more. There's a good start. Now,\nmother, it is your turn. What is that little bit of paper of yours?\"\n\nMrs. Denver unfolded it, and placed it upon Harold's knee.\n\n\"Five thousand pounds!\" he gasped.\n\n\"Ah, but mother is not the only rich one. Look at this!\" And the Admiral\nunfolded his cheque, and placed it upon the other knee.\n\nHarold gazed from one to the other in bewilderment. \"Ten thousand\npounds!\" he cried. \"Good heavens! where did these come from?\"\n\n\"You will not worry any longer, dear,\" murmured his mother, slipping her\narm round him.\n\nBut his quick eye had caught the signature upon one of the cheques.\n\"Doctor Walker!\" he cried, flushing. \"This is Clara's doing. Oh, dad, we\ncannot take this money. It would not be right nor honorable.\"\n\n\"No, boy, I am glad you think so. It is something, however, to have\nproved one's friend, for a real good friend he is. It was he who brought\nit in, though Clara sent him. But this other money will be enough to\ncover everything, and it is all my own.\"\n\n\"Your own? Where did you get it, dad?\"\n\n\"Tut, tut! See what it is to have a City man to deal with. It is my own,\nand fairly earned, and that is enough.\"\n\n\"Dear old dad!\" Harold squeezed his gnarled hand. \"And you, mother!\nYou have lifted the trouble from my heart. I feel another man. You have\nsaved my honor, my good name, everything. I cannot owe you more, for I\nowe you everything already.\"\n\nSo while the autumn sunset shone ruddily through the broad window these\nthree sat together hand in hand, with hearts which were too full to\nspeak. Suddenly the soft thudding of tennis balls was heard, and Mrs.\nWestmacott bounded into view upon the lawn with brandished racket and\nshort skirts fluttering in the breeze. The sight came as a relief to\ntheir strained nerves, and they burst all three into a hearty fit of\nlaughter.\n\n\"She is playing with her nephew,\" said Harold at last. \"The Walkers have\nnot come out yet. I think that it would be well if you were to give me\nthat cheque, mother, and I were to return it in person.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Harold. I think it would be very nice.\"\n\nHe went in through the garden. Clara and the Doctor were sitting\ntogether in the dining-room. She sprang to her feet at the sight of him.\n\n\"Oh, Harold, I have been waiting for you so impatiently,\" she cried; \"I\nsaw you pass the front windows half an hour ago. I would have come in if\nI dared. Do tell us what has happened.\"\n\n\"I have come in to thank you both. How can I repay you for your\nkindness? Here is your cheque, Doctor. I have not needed it. I find that\nI can lay my hands on enough to pay my creditors.\"\n\n\"Thank God!\" said Clara fervently.\n\n\"The sum is less than I thought, and our resources considerably more. We\nhave been able to do it with ease.\"\n\n\"With ease!\" The Doctor's brow clouded and his manner grew cold. \"I\nthink, Harold, that you would do better to take this money of mine, than\nto use that which seems to you to be gained with ease.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir. If I borrowed from any one it would be from you. But\nmy father has this very sum, five thousand pounds, and, as I tell him, I\nowe him so much that I have no compunction about owing him more.\"\n\n\"No compunction! Surely there are some sacrifices which a son should not\nallow his parents to make.\"\n\n\"Sacrifices! What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Is it possible that you do not know how this money has been obtained?\"\n\n\"I give you my word, Doctor Walker, that I have no idea. I asked my\nfather, but he refused to tell me.\"\n\n\"I thought not,\" said the Doctor, the gloom clearing from his brow. \"I\nwas sure that you were not a man who, to clear yourself from a little\nmoney difficulty, would sacrifice the happiness of your mother and the\nhealth of your father.\"\n\n\"Good gracious! what do you mean?\"\n\n\"It is only right that you should know. That money represents the\ncommutation of your father's pension. He has reduced himself to poverty,\nand intends to go to sea again to earn a living.\"\n\n\"To sea again! Impossible!\"\n\n\"It is the truth. Charles Westmacott has told Ida. He was with him\nin the City when he took his poor pension about from dealer to dealer\ntrying to sell it. He succeeded at last, and hence the money.\"\n\n\"He has sold his pension!\" cried Harold, with his hands to his face. \"My\ndear old dad has sold his pension!\" He rushed from the room, and burst\nwildly into the presence of his parents once more. \"I cannot take it,\nfather,\" he cried. \"Better bankruptcy than that. Oh, if I had only known\nyour plan! We must have back the pension. Oh, mother, mother, how could\nyou think me capable of such selfishness? Give me the cheque, dad, and\nI will see this man to-night, for I would sooner die like a dog in the\nditch than touch a penny of this money.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. A MIDNIGHT VISITOR.\n\n\nNow all this time, while the tragi-comedy of life was being played in\nthese three suburban villas, while on a commonplace stage love and humor\nand fears and lights and shadows were so swiftly succeeding each other,\nand while these three families, drifted together by fate, were shaping\neach other's destinies and working out in their own fashion the strange,\nintricate ends of human life, there were human eyes which watched over\nevery stage of the performance, and which were keenly critical of\nevery actor on it. Across the road beyond the green palings and the\nclose-cropped lawn, behind the curtains of their creeper-framed windows,\nsat the two old ladies, Miss Bertha and Miss Monica Williams, looking\nout as from a private box at all that was being enacted before them.\nThe growing friendship of the three families, the engagement of Harold\nDenver with Clara Walker, the engagement of Charles Westmacott with her\nsister, the dangerous fascination which the widow exercised over\nthe Doctor, the preposterous behavior of the Walker girls and the\nunhappiness which they had caused their father, not one of these\nincidents escaped the notice of the two maiden ladies. Bertha the\nyounger had a smile or a sigh for the lovers, Monica the elder a frown\nor a shrug for the elders. Every night they talked over what they had\nseen, and their own dull, uneventful life took a warmth and a coloring\nfrom their neighbors as a blank wall reflects a beacon fire.\n\nAnd now it was destined that they should experience the one keen\nsensation of their later years, the one memorable incident from which\nall future incidents should be dated.\n\nIt was on the very night which succeeded the events which have just been\nnarrated, when suddenly into Monica William's head, as she tossed upon\nher sleepless bed, there shot a thought which made her sit up with a\nthrill and a gasp.\n\n\"Bertha,\" said she, plucking at the shoulder of her sister, \"I have left\nthe front window open.\"\n\n\"No, Monica, surely not.\" Bertha sat up also, and thrilled in sympathy.\n\n\"I am sure of it. You remember I had forgotten to water the pots, and\nthen I opened the window, and Jane called me about the jam, and I have\nnever been in the room since.\"\n\n\"Good gracious, Monica, it is a mercy that we have not been murdered in\nour beds. There was a house broken into at Forest Hill last week. Shall\nwe go down and shut it?\"\n\n\"I dare not go down alone, dear, but if you will come with me. Put on\nyour slippers and dressing-gown. We do not need a candle. Now, Bertha,\nwe will go down together.\"\n\nTwo little white patches moved vaguely through the darkness, the stairs\ncreaked, the door whined, and they were at the front room window. Monica\nclosed it gently down, and fastened the snib.\n\n\"What a beautiful moon!\" said she, looking out. \"We can see as clearly\nas if it were day. How peaceful and quiet the three houses are over\nyonder! It seems quite sad to see that 'To Let' card upon number one. I\nwonder how number two will like their going. For my part I could better\nspare that dreadful woman at number three with her short skirts and\nher snake. But, oh, Bertha, look! look!! look!!!\" Her voice had fallen\nsuddenly to a quivering whisper and she was pointing to the Westmacotts'\nhouse. Her sister gave a gasp of horror, and stood with a clutch at\nMonica's arm, staring in the same direction.\n\nThere was a light in the front room, a slight, wavering light such as\nwould be given by a small candle or taper. The blind was down, but\nthe light shone dimly through. Outside in the garden, with his figure\noutlined against the luminous square, there stood a man, his back to the\nroad, his two hands upon the window ledge, and his body rather bent as\nthough he were trying to peep in past the blind. So absolutely still\nand motionless was he that in spite of the moon they might well have\noverlooked him were it not for that tell-tale light behind.\n\n\"Good heaven!\" gasped Bertha, \"it is a burglar.\"\n\nBut her sister set her mouth grimly and shook her head. \"We shall see,\"\nshe whispered. \"It may be something worse.\"\n\nSwiftly and furtively the man stood suddenly erect, and began to push\nthe window slowly up. Then he put one knee upon the sash, glanced round\nto see that all was safe, and climbed over into the room. As he did so\nhe had to push the blind aside. Then the two spectators saw where the\nlight came from. Mrs. Westmacott was standing, as rigid as a statue, in\nthe center of the room, with a lighted taper in her right hand. For an\ninstant they caught a glimpse of her stern face and her white collar.\nThen the blind fell back into position, and the two figures disappeared\nfrom their view.\n\n\"Oh, that dreadful woman!\" cried Monica. \"That dreadful, dreadful woman!\nShe was waiting for him. You saw it with your own eyes, sister Bertha!\"\n\n\"Hush, dear, hush and listen!\" said her more charitable companion.\nThey pushed their own window up once more, and watched from behind the\ncurtains.\n\nFor a long time all was silent within the house. The light still\nstood motionless as though Mrs. Westmacott remained rigidly in the one\nposition, while from time to time a shadow passed in front of it to show\nthat her midnight visitor was pacing up and down in front of her. Once\nthey saw his outline clearly, with his hands outstretched as if in\nappeal or entreaty. Then suddenly there was a dull sound, a cry, the\nnoise of a fall, the taper was extinguished, and a dark figure fled in\nthe moonlight, rushed across the garden, and vanished amid the shrubs at\nthe farther side.\n\nThen only did the two old ladies understand that they had looked on\nwhilst a tragedy had been enacted. \"Help!\" they cried, and \"Help!\" in\ntheir high, thin voices, timidly at first, but gathering volume as they\nwent on, until the Wilderness rang with their shrieks. Lights shone\nin all the windows opposite, chains rattled, bars were unshot, doors\nopened, and out rushed friends to the rescue. Harold, with a stick; the\nAdmiral, with his sword, his grey head and bare feet protruding from\neither end of a long brown ulster; finally, Doctor Walker, with a poker,\nall ran to the help of the Westmacotts. Their door had been already\nopened, and they crowded tumultuously into the front room.\n\nCharles Westmacott, white to his lips, was kneeling an the floor,\nsupporting his aunt's head upon his knee. She lay outstretched, dressed\nin her ordinary clothes, the extinguished taper still grasped in her\nhand, no mark or wound upon her--pale, placid, and senseless.\n\n\"Thank God you are come, Doctor,\" said Charles, looking up. \"Do tell me\nhow she is, and what I should do.\"\n\nDoctor Walker kneeled beside her, and passed his left hand over her\nhead, while he grasped her pulse with the right.\n\n\"She has had a terrible blow,\" said he. \"It must have been with some\nblunt weapon. Here is the place behind the ear. But she is a woman of\nextraordinary physical powers. Her pulse is full and slow. There is no\nstertor. It is my belief that she is merely stunned, and that she is in\nno danger at all.\"\n\n\"Thank God for that!\"\n\n\"We must get her to bed. We shall carry her upstairs, and then I shall\nsend my girls in to her. But who has done this?\"\n\n\"Some robber,\" said Charles. \"You see that the window is open. She must\nhave heard him and come down, for she was always perfectly fearless. I\nwish to goodness she had called me.\"\n\n\"But she was dressed.\"\n\n\"Sometimes she sits up very late.\"\n\n\"I did sit up very late,\" said a voice. She had opened her eyes, and was\nblinking at them in the lamplight. \"A villain came in through the window\nand struck me with a life-preserver. You can tell the police so when\nthey come. Also that it was a little fat man. Now, Charles, give me your\narm and I shall go upstairs.\"\n\nBut her spirit was greater than her strength, for, as she staggered to\nher feet, her head swam round, and she would have fallen again had her\nnephew not thrown his arms round her. They carried her upstairs among\nthem and laid her upon the bed, where the Doctor watched beside her,\nwhile Charles went off to the police-station, and the Denvers mounted\nguard over the frightened maids.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. IN PORT AT LAST.\n\n\nDay had broken before the several denizens of the Wilderness had all\nreturned to their homes, the police finished their inquiries, and all\ncome back to its normal quiet. Mrs. Westmacott had been left sleeping\npeacefully with a small chloral draught to steady her nerves and a\nhandkerchief soaked in arnica bound round her head. It was with some\nsurprise, therefore, that the Admiral received a note from her about ten\no'clock, asking him to be good enough to step in to her. He hurried in,\nfearing that she might have taken some turn for the worse, but he was\nreassured to find her sitting up in her bed, with Clara and Ida Walker\nin attendance upon her. She had removed the handkerchief, and had put on\na little cap with pink ribbons, and a maroon dressing-jacket, daintily\nfulled at the neck and sleeves.\n\n\"My dear friend,\" said she as he entered, \"I wish to make a last few\nremarks to you. No, no,\" she continued, laughing, as she saw a look of\ndismay upon his face. \"I shall not dream of dying for at least another\nthirty years. A woman should be ashamed to die before she is seventy.\nI wish, Clara, that you would ask your father to step up. And you, Ida,\njust pass me my cigarettes, and open me a bottle of stout.\"\n\n\"Now then,\" she continued, as the doctor joined their party. \"I don't\nquite know what I ought to say to you, Admiral. You want some very plain\nspeaking to.\"\n\n\"'Pon my word, ma'am, I don't know what you are talking about.\"\n\n\"The idea of you at your age talking of going to sea, and leaving that\ndear, patient little wife of yours at home, who has seen nothing of you\nall her life! It's all very well for you. You have the life, and the\nchange, and the excitement, but you don't think of her eating her heart\nout in a dreary London lodging. You men are all the same.\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am, since you know so much, you probably know also that I have\nsold my pension. How am I to live if I do not turn my hand to work?\"\n\nMrs. Westmacott produced a large registered envelope from beneath the\nsheets and tossed it over to the old seaman.\n\n\"That excuse won't do. There are your pension papers. Just see if they\nare right.\"\n\nHe broke the seal, and out tumbled the very papers which he had made\nover to McAdam two days before.\n\n\"But what am I to do with these now?\" he cried in bewilderment.\n\n\"You will put them in a safe place, or get a friend to do so, and, if\nyou do your duty, you will go to your wife and beg her pardon for having\neven for an instant thought of leaving her.\"\n\nThe Admiral passed his hand over his rugged forehead. \"This is very good\nof you, ma'am,\" said he, \"very good and kind, and I know that you are a\nstaunch friend, but for all that these papers mean money, and though we\nmay have been in broken water lately, we are not quite in such straits\nas to have to signal to our friends. When we do, ma'am, there's no one\nwe would look to sooner than to you.\"\n\n\"Don't be ridiculous!\" said the widow. \"You know nothing whatever about\nit, and yet you stand there laying down the law. I'll have my way in\nthe matter, and you shall take the papers, for it is no favor that I am\ndoing you, but simply a restoration of stolen property.\"\n\n\"How's that, ma'am?\"\n\n\"I am just going to explain, though you might take a lady's word for\nit without asking any questions. Now, what I am going to say is just\nbetween you four, and must go no farther. I have my own reasons for\nwishing to keep it from the police. Who do you think it was who struck\nme last night, Admiral?\"\n\n\"Some villain, ma'am. I don't know his name.\"\n\n\"But I do. It was the same man who ruined or tried to ruin your son. It\nwas my only brother, Jeremiah.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"I will tell you about him--or a little about him, for he has done much\nwhich I would not care to talk of, nor you to listen to. He was always\na villain, smooth-spoken and plausible, but a dangerous, subtle villain\nall the same. If I have some hard thoughts about mankind I can trace\nthem back to the childhood which I spent with my brother. He is my only\nliving relative, for my other brother, Charles's father, was killed in\nthe Indian mutiny.\n\n\"Our father was rich, and when he died he made a good provision both for\nJeremiah and for me. He knew Jeremiah and he mistrusted him, however; so\ninstead of giving him all that he meant him to have he handed me over a\npart of it, telling me, with what was almost his dying breath, to hold\nit in trust for my brother, and to use it in his behalf when he should\nhave squandered or lost all that he had. This arrangement was meant to\nbe a secret between my father and myself, but unfortunately his words\nwere overheard by the nurse, and she repeated them afterwards to my\nbrother, so that he came to know that I held some money in trust for\nhim. I suppose tobacco will not harm my head, Doctor? Thank you, then I\nshall trouble you for the matches, Ida.\" She lit a cigarette, and leaned\nback upon the pillow, with the blue wreaths curling from her lips.\n\n\"I cannot tell you how often he has attempted to get that money from me.\nHe has bullied, cajoled, threatened, coaxed, done all that a man could\ndo. I still held it with the presentiment that a need for it would come.\nWhen I heard of this villainous business, his flight, and his leaving\nhis partner to face the storm, above all that my old friend had been\ndriven to surrender his income in order to make up for my brother's\ndefalcations, I felt that now indeed I had a need for it. I sent in\nCharles yesterday to Mr. McAdam, and his client, upon hearing the facts\nof the case, very graciously consented to give back the papers, and\nto take the money which he had advanced. Not a word of thanks to me,\nAdmiral. I tell you that it was very cheap benevolence, for it was all\ndone with his own money, and how could I use it better?\n\n\"I thought that I should probably hear from him soon, and I did. Last\nevening there was handed in a note of the usual whining, cringing tone.\nHe had come back from abroad at the risk of his life and liberty, just\nin order that he might say good-bye to the only sister he ever had, and\nto entreat my forgiveness for any pain which he had caused me. He would\nnever trouble me again, and he begged only that I would hand over to him\nthe sum which I held in trust for him. That, with what he had already,\nwould be enough to start him as an honest man in the new world, when\nhe would ever remember and pray for the dear sister who had been his\nsavior. That was the style of the letter, and it ended by imploring me\nto leave the window-latch open, and to be in the front room at three in\nthe morning, when he would come to receive my last kiss and to bid me\nfarewell.\n\n\"Bad as he was, I could not, when he trusted me, betray him. I said\nnothing, but I was there at the hour. He entered through the window,\nand implored me to give him the money. He was terribly changed; gaunt,\nwolfish, and spoke like a madman. I told him that I had spent the money.\nHe gnashed his teeth at me, and swore it was his money. I told him that\nI had spent it on him. He asked me how. I said in trying to make him an\nhonest man, and in repairing the results of his villainy. He shrieked\nout a curse, and pulling something out of the breast of his coat--a\nloaded stick, I think--he struck me with it, and I remembered nothing\nmore.\"\n\n\"The blackguard!\" cried the Doctor, \"but the police must be hot upon his\ntrack.\"\n\n\"I fancy not,\" Mrs. Westmacott answered calmly. \"As my brother is a\nparticularly tall, thin man, and as the police are looking for a short,\nfat one, I do not think that it is very probable that they will catch\nhim. It is best, I think, that these little family matters should be\nadjusted in private.\"\n\n\"My dear ma'am,\" said the Admiral, \"if it is indeed this man's money\nthat has bought back my pension, then I can have no scruples about\ntaking it. You have brought sunshine upon us, ma'am, when the clouds\nwere at their darkest, for here is my boy who insists upon returning\nthe money which I got. He can keep it now to pay his debts. For what you\nhave done I can only ask God to bless you, ma'am, and as to thanking you\nI can't even----\"\n\n\"Then pray don't try,\" said the widow. \"Now run away, Admiral, and make\nyour peace with Mrs. Denver. I am sure if I were she it would be a long\ntime before I should forgive you. As for me, I am going to America when\nCharles goes. You'll take me so far, won't you, Ida? There is a college\nbeing built in Denver which is to equip the woman of the future for the\nstruggle of life, and especially for her battle against man. Some months\nago the committee offered me a responsible situation upon the staff, and\nI have decided now to accept it, for Charles's marriage removes the\nlast tie which binds me to England. You will write to me sometimes,\nmy friends, and you will address your letters to Professor Westmacott,\nEmancipation College, Denver. From there I shall watch how the glorious\nstruggle goes in conservative old England, and if I am needed you will\nfind me here again fighting in the forefront of the fray. Good-bye--but\nnot you, girls; I have still a word I wish to say to you.\n\n\"Give me your hand, Ida, and yours, Clara,\" said she when they were\nalone. \"Oh, you naughty little pusses, aren't you ashamed to look me in\nthe face? Did you think--did you really think that I was so very blind,\nand could not see your little plot? You did it very well, I must say\nthat, and really I think that I like you better as you are. But you had\nall your pains for nothing, you little conspirators, for I give you my\nword that I had quite made up my mind not to have him.\"\n\nAnd so within a few weeks our little ladies from their observatory saw\na mighty bustle in the Wilderness, when two-horse carriages came, and\ncoachmen with favors, to bear away the twos who were destined to come\nback one. And they themselves in their crackling silk dresses went\nacross, as invited, to the big double wedding breakfast which was held\nin the house of Doctor Walker. Then there was health-drinking, and\nlaughter, and changing of dresses, and rice-throwing when the carriages\ndrove up again, and two more couples started on that journey which ends\nonly with life itself.\n\nCharles Westmacott is now a flourishing ranchman in the western part\nof Texas, where he and his sweet little wife are the two most popular\npersons in all that county. Of their aunt they see little, but from time\nto time they see notices in the papers that there is a focus of light\nin Denver, where mighty thunderbolts are being forged which will one day\nbring the dominant sex upon their knees. The Admiral and his wife still\nlive at number one, while Harold and Clara have taken number two, where\nDoctor Walker continues to reside. As to the business, it had been\nreconstructed, and the energy and ability of the junior partner had soon\nmade up for all the ill that had been done by his senior. Yet with his\nsweet and refined home atmosphere he is able to realize his wish, and\nto keep himself free from the sordid aims and base ambitions which drag\ndown the man whose business lies too exclusively in the money market\nof the vast Babylon. As he goes back every evening from the crowds of\nThrogmorton Street to the tree-lined peaceful avenues of Norwood, so he\nhas found it possible in spirit also to do one's duties amidst the babel\nof the City, and yet to live beyond it.",
