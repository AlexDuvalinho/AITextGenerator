I am going to learn a\ntrade.”\n\n“I am sorry to part with you, David. Couldn’t you stay another term?”\n\n“No: my uncle says I must be earning my living, and I have a chance to\nlearn the carpenter’s trade.”\n\n“Where are you going?”\n\n“To Duffield, some twenty miles away. I wish I were in your shoes. You\nhave no money cares, and can go on quietly and complete your education.”\n\n“I don’t know how I am situated, David. I only know that my guardian\npays my expenses at this boarding school.”\n\n“Yes, you are a star boarder, and have the nicest room in the\ninstitution. I am only a poor day scholar. Still I feel thankful that I\nhave been allowed to remain as long as I have. Who is your guardian?”\n\n“A Mr. Benjamin Fielding, of New York.”\n\n“Is he a business man?”\n\n“I believe so.”\n\n“Do you know how much you will inherit when you come of age?” asked\nDavid, after a short pause.\n\n“I haven’t an idea.”\n\n“It seems to me your guardian ought to have told you.”\n\n“I scarcely know my guardian. Five years ago I spent a week at his home.\nI don’t remember much about it except that he lives in a handsome house,\nand has plenty of servants. Since then, as you know, I have passed most\nof my time here, except that in the summer I was allowed to board at the\nCatskills or any country place I might select.”\n\n“Yes, and I remember one year you took me with you and paid all my\nexpenses. I shall never forget your kindness, and how much I enjoyed\nthat summer.”\n\nRodney Ropes smiled, and his smile made his usually grave face look very\nattractive.\n\n“My dear David,” he said, “it was all selfishness on my part. I knew I\nshould enjoy myself much better with a companion.”\n\n“You may call that selfishness, Rodney, but it is a kind of selfishness\nthat makes me your devoted friend. How long do you think you shall\nremain at school?”\n\n“I don’t know. My guardian has never told me his plans for me. I wish he\nwould.”\n\n“I shall miss you, Rodney, but we will correspond, won’t we?”\n\n“Surely. You know I shall always feel interested in you and your\nwelfare.”\n\nDavid was a plain boy of humble parentage, and would probably be a hard\nworking mechanic. In fact he was looking for nothing better.\n\nBut Rodney Ropes looked to be of genteel blood, and had the air of\none who had been brought up a gentleman. But different as they were in\nsocial position the two boys had always been devoted friends.\n\nThe boarding school of which Rodney was, as his friend expressed\nhimself, a star pupil, was situated about fifty miles from the city of\nNew York. It was under the charge of Dr. Sampson, a tall, thin man\nof fair scholarship, keenly alive to his own interest, who showed\npartiality for his richer pupils, and whenever he had occasion to\ncensure bore most heavily upon boys like David Hull, who was poor.\n\nRodney occupied alone the finest room in the school. There was a great\ncontrast between his comfortable quarters and the extremely plain\ndormitories occupied by less favored pupils.\n\nIn the case of some boys the favoritism of the teacher would have led\nthem to put on airs, and made them unpopular with their school\nfellows. But Rodney had too noble a nature to be influenced by such\nconsiderations. He enjoyed his comfortable room, but treated his school\nfellows with a frank cordiality that made him a general favorite.\n\nAfter David left his room Rodney sat down to prepare a lesson in Cicero,\nwhen he was interrupted by the entrance through the half open door of a\nyounger boy.\n\n“Rodney,” he said, “the doctor would like to see you in his office.”\n\n“Very well, Brauner, I will go down at once.”\n\nHe put aside his book and went down to the office of Dr. Sampson on the\nfirst floor.\n\nThe doctor was sitting at his desk. He turned slightly as Rodney\nentered.\n\n“Take a seat, Ropes,” he said curtly.\n\nHis tone was so different from his usual cordiality that Rodney was\nsomewhat surprised.\n\n“Am I in disgrace?” he asked himself. “Dr. Sampson doesn’t seem as\nfriendly as usual.”\n\nAfter a brief interval Dr. Sampson wheeled round in his office chair.\n\n“I have a letter for you from your guardian, Ropes,” he said. “Here it\nis. Do me the favor to read it here.”\n\nWith some wonder Rodney took the letter and read as follows:\n\n\nDEAR RODNEY--I have bad news to communicate. As you know, I was left by\nyour father in charge of you and your fortune. I have never told you\nthe amount, but I will say now that it was about fifty thousand dollars.\nUntil two years since I kept it intact but then began a series of\nreverses in which my own fortune was swallowed up. In the hope of\nrelieving myself I regret to say that I was tempted to use your money.\nThat went also, and now of the whole sum there remains but enough to\npay the balance of your school bills, leaving you penniless. How much I\nregret this I cannot tell you. I shall leave New York at once. I do not\ncare at present to say where I shall go, but I shall try to make good\nthe loss, and eventually restore to you your lost fortune. I may be\nsuccessful or I may not. I shall do my best and I hope in time to have\nbetter news to communicate.\n\nOne thing I am glad to say. I have a casket containing your mother’s\njewels. These are intact. I shall send you the casket by express,\nknowing that you will wish to keep them out of regard for your mother’s\nmemory. In case you are reduced to the necessity of pawning or selling\nthem, I am sure that your mother, could she be consulted, would advise\nyou to do so. This would be better than to have you suffer from want.\n\nThere is nothing further for me to write except to repeat my regret, and\nrenew my promise to make up your lost fortune if I shall ever to able to\ndo so. Your Guardian, BENJAMIN FIELDING.\n\n\nRodney read this like one dazed. In an instant he was reduced from the\nposition of a favorite of fortune to a needy boy, with his living to\nmake.\n\nHe could not help recalling what had passed between his friend David and\nhimself earlier in the day. Now he was as poor as David--poorer, in fact\nfor David had a chance to learn a trade that would yield him a living,\nwhile he was utterly without resources, except in having an unusually\ngood education.\n\n“Well,” said Dr. Sampson, “have you read your letter?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Your guardian wrote to me also. This is his letter,” and he placed the\nbrief epistle in Rodney’s hands.\n\n\nDR. SAMPSON--I have written my ward, Rodney Ropes, an important\nletter which he will show you. The news which it contains will make it\nnecessary for him to leave school. I inclose a check for one hundred and\ntwenty five dollars. Keep whatever is due you, and give him the balance.\nBENJAMIN FIELDING.\n\n\n“I have read the letter, but I don’t know what it means,” said Dr.\nSampson. “Can you throw any light upon it?”\n\n“Here is my letter, doctor. You can read it for yourself.”\n\nDr. Sampson’s face changed as he read Rodney’s letter. It changed and\nhardened, and his expression became quite different from that to which\nRodney had been accustomed.\n\n“This is a bad business, Ropes,” said the doctor in a hard tone.\n\nHe had always said Rodney before.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“That was a handsome fortune which your father left you.”\n\n“Yes, sir. I never knew before how much it amounted to.”\n\n“You only learn when you have lost it. Mr. Fielding has treated you\nshamefully.”\n\n“Yes, sir, I suppose he has, but he says he will try to make it up to me\nin the future.”\n\n“Pish! that is all humbug. Even if he is favored by fortune you will\nnever get back a cent.”\n\n“I think I shall, sir.”\n\n“You are young. You do not know the iniquities of business men. I do.”\n\n“I prefer to hope for the best.”\n\n“Just as you please.”\n\n“Have you anything more to say to me?”\n\n“Only that I will figure up your account and see how much money is to\ncome to you out of the check your guardian has sent. You can stay here\ntill Monday; then you will find it best to make new arrangements.”\n\n“Very well, sir.”\n\nRodney left the room, realizing that Dr. Sampson’s feelings had been\nchanged by his pupil’s reverse of fortune.\n\nIt was the way of the world, but it was not a pleasant way, and Rodney\nfelt depressed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nTHE CASKET OF JEWELS.\n\n\nIt was not till the latter part of the afternoon that the casket\narrived. Rodney was occupied with a recitation, and it was only in\nthe evening that he got an opportunity to open it. There was a pearl\nnecklace, very handsome, a pair of bracelets, two gold chains, some\nminor articles of jewelry and a gold ring.\n\nA locket attracted Rodney’s notice, and he opened it. It contained the\npictures of his father and mother.\n\nHis father he could barely remember, his mother died before he was old\nenough to have her image impressed upon his memory. He examined the\nlocket and his heart was saddened. He felt how different his life would\nhave been had his parents lived.\n\nHe had never before realized the sorrow of being alone in the world.\nMisfortune had come upon him, and so far as he knew he had not a friend.\nEven Dr. Sampson, who had been paid so much money on his account, and\nwho had always professed so great friendship for him, had turned cold.\n\nAs he was standing with the locket in his hand there was a knock at the\ndoor.\n\n“Come in!” he called out.\n\nThe door opened and a stout, coarse looking boy, dressed in an expensive\nmanner, entered.\n\n“Good evening, John,” said Rodney, but not cordially.\n\nNext to himself, John Bundy, who was the son of a wealthy saloon keeper\nin the city of New York, had been a favorite with Dr. Sampson.\n\nIf there was anything Dr. Sampson bowed down to and respected it was\nwealth, and Mr. Bundy, senior, was reputed to be worth a considerable\nfortune.\n\nIn Rodney’s mood John Bundy was about the last person whom he wanted to\nsee.\n\n“Ha!” said John, espying the open casket, “where did you get all that\njewelry?”\n\n“It contains my mother’s jewels,” said Rodney gravely.\n\n“You never showed it to me before.”\n\n“I never had it before. It came to me by express this afternoon.”\n\n“It must be worth a good pile of money,” said John, his eyes gleaming\nwith cupidity.\n\n“I suppose it is.”\n\n“Have you any idea what it is worth?”\n\n“I have no thought about it.”\n\n“What are you going to do with it? It won’t be of use to you, especially\nthe diamond earrings,” he added, with a coarse laugh.\n\n“No,” answered Rodney shortly.\n\n“My eyes, wouldn’t my mother like to own all this jewelry. She’s fond of\nornament, but pa won’t buy them for her.”\n\nRodney did not answer.\n\n“I say, Ropes, I mustn’t forget my errand. Will you do me a favor?”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Lend me five dollars till the first of next month. My allowance comes\ndue then. Now I haven’t but a quarter left.”\n\n“What makes you apply to me, Bundy?”\n\n“Because you always have money. I don’t suppose you are worth as much as\nmy father, but you have more money for yourself than I have.”\n\n“I have had, perhaps, but I haven’t now.”\n\n“Why, what’s up? What has happened?”\n\n“I have lost my fortune.”\n\nJohn whistled. This was his way of expressing amazement.\n\n“Why, what have you been doing? How could you lose your fortune?”\n\n“My guardian has lost it for me. That amount to the same thing.”\n\n“When did you hear that?”\n\n“This morning.”\n\n“Is that true? Are you really a poor boy?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nJohn Bundy was astonished, but on the whole he was not saddened. In the\nestimation of the school Rodney had always ranked higher than he, and\nbeen looked upon as the star pupil in point of wealth.\n\nNow that he was dethroned John himself would take his place. This would\nbe gratifying, though just at present, and till the beginning of the\nnext month, he would be distressed for ready money.\n\n“Well, that’s a stunner!” he said. “How do you feel about it? Shall you\nstay in school?”\n\n“No; I can’t afford it. I must get to work.”\n\n“Isn’t there anything left--not a cent?”\n\n“There may be a few dollars.”\n\n“And then,” said Bundy with a sudden thought, “there is this casket of\njewelry. You can sell it for a good deal of money.”\n\n“I don’t mean to sell it.”\n\n“Then you’re a fool; that’s all I’ve got to say.”\n\n“I don’t suppose you will understand my feeling in the matter, but these\narticles belonged to my mother. They are all I have to remind me of her.\nI do not mean to sell them unless it is absolutely necessary.”\n\n“I would sell them quicker’n a wink,” said Bundy. “What’s the good of\nkeeping them?”\n\n“We won’t discuss the matter,” said Rodney coldly.\n\n“Do you mind my telling the other boys about your losing your money?”\n\n“No; it will be known tomorrow at any rate; there is no advantage in\nconcealing it.”\n\nA heavy step was heard outside. It stopped before the door.\n\n“I must be getting,” said Bundy, “or I’ll get into trouble.”\n\nIt was against the rule at the school for boys to make calls upon each\nother in the evening unless permission were given.\n\nJohn Bundy opened the door suddenly, and to his dismay found himself\nfacing the rigid figure of Dr. Sampson, the principal.\n\n“How do you happen to be here, Bundy?” asked the doctor sternly.\n\n“Please, sir, I was sympathizing with Ropes on his losing his money,”\n said Bundy with ready wit.\n\n“Very well! I will excuse you this time.”\n\n“I’m awful sorry for you, Ropes,” said Bundy effusively.\n\n“Thank you,” responded Rodney.\n\n“You can go now,” said the principal. “I have a little business with\nMaster Ropes.”\n\n“All right, sir. Good night.”\n\n“Good night.”\n\n“Won’t you sit down, Dr. Sampson?” said Rodney politely, and he took the\ncasket from the chair.\n\n“Yes, I wish to have five minutes’ conversation with you. So these are\nthe jewels, are they?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“They seem to be quite valuable,” went on the doctor, lifting the pearl\nnecklace and poising it in his fingers. “It will be well for you to have\nthem appraised by a jeweler.”\n\n“It would, sir, if I wished to sell them, but I mean to keep them as\nthey are.”\n\n“I would hardly advise it. You will need the money. Probably you do not\nknow how near penniless you are.”\n\n“No, sir; I don’t know.”\n\n“Your guardian, as you are aware, sent me a check for one hundred and\ntwenty five dollars. I have figured up how much of this sum is due to\nme, and I find it to be one hundred and thirteen dollars and thirty\nseven cents.”\n\n“Yes, sir,” said Rodney indifferently.\n\n“This leaves for you only eleven dollars and sixty three cents. You\nfollow me, do you not?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Have you any money saved up from your allowance?”\n\n“A few dollars only, sir.”\n\n“Ahem! that is a pity. You will need all you can raise. But of course\nyou did not anticipate what has occurred?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“I will throw off the thirty seven cents,” said the principal\nmagnanimously, “and give you back twelve dollars.”\n\n“I would rather pay you the whole amount of your bill,” said Rodney.\n\n“Ahem! Well perhaps that would be more business-like. So you don’t wish\nto part with any of the jewelry, Ropes?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“I thought, perhaps, by way of helping you, I would take the earrings,\nand perhaps the necklace, off your hands and present them to Mrs.\nSampson.”\n\nRodney shuddered with aversion at the idea of these precious articles,\nwhich had once belonged to his mother, being transferred to the stout\nand coarse featured consort of the principal.\n\n“I think I would rather keep them,” he replied.\n\n“Oh well, just as you please,” said Dr. Sampson with a shade of\ndisappointment for he had no idea of paying more than half what the\narticles were worth. “If the time comes when you wish to dispose of them\nlet me know.”\n\nRodney nodded, but did not answer in words.\n\n“Of course, Ropes,” went on the doctor in a perfunctory way, “I am very\nsorry for you. I shall miss you, and, if I could afford it, I would tell\nyou to stay without charge. But I am a poor man.”\n\n“Yes,” said Rodney hastily, “I understand. I thank you for your words\nbut would not under any circumstances accept such a favor at your\nhands.”\n\n“I am afraid you are proud, Ropes. Pride is--ahem--a wrong feeling.”\n\n“Perhaps so, Dr. Sampson, but I wish to earn my own living without being\nindebted to any one.”\n\n“Perhaps you are right, Ropes. I dare say I should feel so myself. When\ndo you propose leaving us?”\n\n“Some time tomorrow, sir.”\n\n“I shall feel sad to have you go. You have been here so long that\nyou seem to me like a son. But we must submit to the dispensations of\nProvidence--” and Dr. Sampson blew a vigorous blast upon his red silk\nhandkerchief. “I will give you the balance due in the morning.”\n\n“Very well, sir.”\n\nRodney was glad to be left alone. He had no faith in Dr. Sampson’s\nsympathy. The doctor had the reputation of being worth from thirty to\nforty thousand dollars, and his assumption of being a poor man Rodney\nknew to be a sham.\n\nHe went to bed early, for tomorrow was to be the beginning of a new life\nfor him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nA STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE.\n\n\nWhen it was generally known in the school that Rodney was to leave\nbecause he had lost his property much sympathy was felt and expressed\nfor him.\n\nThough he had received more than ordinary attention from the principal\non account of his pecuniary position and expectations, this had not\nimpaired his popularity. He never put on any airs and was on as cordial\nrelations with the poorest student as with the richest.\n\n“I’m awfully sorry you’re going, Rodney,” said more than one. “Is it\nreally true that you have lost your property?”\n\n“Yes, it is true.”\n\n“Do you feel bad about it?”\n\n“I feel sorry, but not discouraged.”\n\n“I say, Rodney,” said Ernest Rayner, in a low voice, calling Rodney\naside, “are you very short of money?”\n\n“I haven’t much left, Ernest.”\n\n“Because I received five dollars last week as a birthday present. I\nhaven’t spent any of it. You can have it as well as not.”\n\nRodney was much moved. “My dear Ernest,” he said, putting his arm\ncaressingly around the neck of the smaller boy, “you are a true friend.\nI won’t forget your generous offer, though I don’t need to accept it.”\n\n“But are you sure you have money enough?” asked Ernest.\n\n“Yes, I have enough for the present. By the time I need more I shall\nhave earned it.”\n\nThere was one boy, already introduced, John Bundy, who did not share in\nthe general feeling of sympathy for Rodney. This was John Bundy.\n\nHe felt that Rodney’s departure would leave him the star pupil and give\nhim the chief social position in school. As to scholarship he was not\nambitious to stand high in that.\n\n“I say, Ropes,” he said complacently, “I’m to have your room after\nyou’re gone.”\n\n“I congratulate you,” returned Rodney. “It is an excellent room.”\n\n“Yes, I s’pose it’ll make you feel bad. Where are you going?”\n\n“I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have done.”\n\n“Oh yes, I guess there’s no doubt of that. I’m going to get pa to send\nme some nice pictures to hang on the wall. When you come back here on a\nvisit you’ll see how nice it looks.”\n\n“I think it will be a good while before I come here on a visit.”\n\n“Yes. I s’pose it’ll make you feel bad. Where are you going?”\n\n“To the City of New York.”\n\n“You’ll have to live in a small hall bedroom there.”\n\n“Why will I?”\n\n“Because you are poor, and it costs a good deal of money to live in New\nYork. It’ll be a great come down.”\n\n“It will indeed, but if I can earn enough to support me in plain style\nI won’t complain. I suppose you’ll call and see me when you come to New\nYork?”\n\n“Perhaps so, if you don’t live in a tenement house. Pa objects to my\ngoing to tenement houses. There’s no knowing what disease there may be\nin them.”\n\n“It is well to be prudent,” said Rodney, smiling.\n\nIt did not trouble him much to think he was not likely to receive a call\nfrom his quondan schoolmate.\n\n“Here is the balance of your money, Ropes,” said Dr. Sampson, drawing\na small roll of bills from his pocket, later in the day. “I am quite\nwilling to give you the odd thirty seven cents.”\n\n“Thank you, doctor, but I shan’t need it.”\n\n“You are poorly provided. Now I would pay you a good sum for some of\nyour mother’s jewelry, as I told you last evening.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Rodney hastily, “but I don’t care to sell at present.”\n\n“Let me know when you are ready to dispose of the necklace.”\n\nHere the depot carriage appeared in the street outside and Rodney with\nhis gripsack in one hand and the precious casket in the other, climbed\nto a seat beside the driver.\n\nHis trunk he left behind, promising to send for it when he had found a\nnew boarding place.\n\nThere was a chorus of good byes. Rodney waved his handkerchief in\ngeneral farewell, and the carriage started for the depot.\n\n“Be you goin’ for good?” asked Joel, the driver, who knew Rodney well\nand felt friendly to him.\n\n“Yes, Joel.”\n\n“It’s kind of sudden, isn’t it?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What makes you go?”\n\n“Bad news, Joel.”\n\n“Be any of your folks dead?”\n\n“It is not death. I haven’t any ‘folks.’ I’m alone in the world.\nIt’s because I’ve lost my property and am too poor to remain in school.”\n\n“That’s too bad,” said the driver in a tone of sympathy. “Where are you\ngoin’?”\n\n“To the city.”\n\n“Are you goin’ to work?”\n\n“Yes, I shall have to.”\n\n“If you was a little older you might get a chance to drive a street car,\nbut I s’pose you’re too young.”\n\n“Yes, I don’t think they would take me.”\n\n“I’ve thought sometimes I should like such a chance myself,” said Joel.\n“I’ve got tired of the country. I should like to live in the city where\nthere’s theaters, and shows, and such like. Do you know what the drivers\non street cars get?”\n\n“No, I never heard.”\n\n“I wish you’d find out and let me know. You can send the letter to Joel\nPhipps, Groveton. Then find out if it’s easy to get such a chance.”\n\n“I will. I shall be glad to oblige you.”\n\n“You always was obligin’, Rodney. I’ve asked Jack Bundy to do it--you\nknow his folks live in the city--but he never would. He’s a mighty\ndisagreeable boy. He never liked you.”\n\n“Didn’t he?”\n\n“No, I surmise he was jealous of you. He used to say you put on so many\nairs it made him sick.”\n\n“I don’t think any of the other boys would say that.”\n\n“No, but they could say it of him. Do you think his father is rich?”\n\n“I have always heard that he was.”\n\n“I hope he’s better about paying his debt than Jack. I lent him twenty\nfive cents a year ago and I never could get it back.”\n\nThe distance from the school to the station was a mile. Joel fetched the\ncarriage round with a sweep and then jumped off, opened the door, and\nthen helped the passengers to disembark, if that word is allowable.\n\n“How soon does the train start, Joel?” asked Rodney.\n\n“In about five minutes.”\n\n“Then I had better purchase my ticket without delay.”\n\n“Don’t forget to ask about horse car drivers!”\n\n“No, I won’t. I should like to have you come to New York. I know no one\nthere, and I should feel glad to see a familiar face.”\n\nThe train came up in time, and Rodney was one of half a dozen passengers\nwho entered the cars.\n\nHe obtained a place next to a stout man dressed in a pepper and salt\nsuit.\n\n“Is this seat engaged?” asked Rodney.\n\n“Yes--to you,” and his fellow passenger laughed.\n\nRodney laughed too, for he saw that the remark was meant to be jocose.\n\nHe put his gripsack on the floor at his feet, but held the casket in his\nlap. He did not like to run any risk with that.\n\n“Are you a drummer?” asked the stout man, with a glance at the casket.\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“I thought you might be, and that THAT might contain your samples.”\n\n“No, sir. That is private property.”\n\nHe had thought of telling what it contained, but checked himself. He\nknew nothing of his companion, and was not sure how far it might be safe\nto trust a stranger.\n\n“I used to be a drummer myself--in the jewelry line--” continued his\ncompanion, “and I carried a box just like that.”\n\n“Ah, indeed! Then you are not in that business now?”\n\n“No, I got tired of it. I deal in quite a different article now.”\n\n“Indeed?”\n\n“Suburban lot.”\n\n“You don’t happen to have any of them with you?”\n\nThe stout man roared with laughter, giving Rodney the impression that he\nhad said a very witty thing.\n\n“That’s a good one,” he remarked, “the best I’ve heard for a long time.\nNo, I haven’t any of the lots with me, but I’ve got a circular. Just\ncast your eye over that,” and he drew a large and showy prospectus from\nhis pocket.\n\n“If you should be looking for a good investment,” he continued, “you\ncan’t do any better than buy a lot at Morton Park. It is only eighteen\nmiles from the city and is rapidly building up. You can buy lot on easy\ninstallments, and I will myself pick one out for you that is almost sure\nto double in value in a year or two.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Rodney, “but I shall have to invest my money, if I get\nany, in a different way.”\n\n“As what for instance?”\n\n“In board and lodging.”\n\n“Good. That is even more necessary than real estate.”\n\n“How long have you been in the business, sir?”\n\n“About six months.”\n\n“And how does it pay?”\n\n“Very well, if you know how to talk.”\n\n“I should think you might do well, then.”\n\n“Thank you. I appreciate the compliment. What business are you going\ninto, that is, if you are going to the city?”\n\n“I am going to the city, but I have no idea yet what I shall do.”\n\n“Perhaps you may like to become an agent for our lots. I shall be ready\nto employ you as sub agent if you feel disposed.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. If you will give me your card, I may call upon you.”\n\nThe short man drew from his card case a business card. It bore the name\n\n\nADIN WOODS. ROYAL BUILDING. NASSAU ST. Morton Park Lots.\n\n\n“Come to see me at any time,” he said, “and we will talk the matter\nover.”\n\nHere the train boy came along and Rodney bought a copy of Puck, while\nthe agent resumed the perusal of a copy of a magazine. For an hour\nthe cars ran smoothly. Then there was a sudden shock causing all the\npassengers to start to their feet.\n\n“We’re off the track!” shouted an excitable person in front of Rodney.\n\nThe instinct of self preservation is perhaps stronger than any other.\nRodney and his seat mate both jumped to their feet and hurried to the\ndoor of the car, not knowing what was in store for them.\n\nBut fortunately the train had not been going rapidly. It was approaching\na station and was “slowing up.” So, though it had really run off the\ntrack, there was not likely to be any injury to the passengers.\n\n“We are safe,” said Adin Woods. “The only harm done is the delay. I hope\nthat won’t be long. Suppose we go back to our seat.” They returned to\nthe seat which they had jointly occupied.\n\nThen Rodney made an alarming discovery. “My casket!” he exclaimed.\n“Where is it?”\n\n“What did you do with it?”\n\n“Left it on the seat.”\n\n“It may have fallen to the floor.”\n\nRodney searched for it in feverish excitement, but his search was vain.\nTHE CASKET HAD DISAPPEARED!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nIN PURSUIT OF A THIEF.\n\n\n“Were the contents of the casket valuable?” asked the land agent.\n\n“Yes; it contained my mother’s jewels, all the more valuable because she\nis dead,” replied Rodney.\n\n“Were they of much intrinsic worth?”\n\n“They must be worth several hundred dollars at least.”\n\n“Then they must be found,” said Adin Woods energetically. “They have\nevidently been taken by some passenger during the five minutes we were\naway from our seat.”\n\n“Were you inquiring about the casket?” asked a lady sitting opposite.\n\n“Yes, madam. Can you give any information about it?”\n\n“Just after you left your seat the man that sat behind you rose and\nreaching over for it went to the rear end of the car and got out.”\n\n“I wish you had stopped him, madam.”\n\n“He was so cool about it that I thought he might be a friend of the\nyoung gentleman.”\n\n“I didn’t know him. He must have been a thief.”\n\n“What was his appearance, madam?” asked the lot agent.\n\n“He was a thin, dark complexioned man, with side whiskers coming half\nway down his cheeks.”\n\n“And you say he got out of the rear end of the car?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“He won’t get on the train again,” said the agent turning to Rodney. “He\nthinks the casket valuable enough to pay him for the interruption of his\njourney.”\n\n“What shall I do then?” asked Rodney, feeling helpless and at a loss\nwhich way to turn.\n\n“Follow him,” said the agent briefly. “He will probably stop over in the\nvillage a day and resume his journey tomorrow.”\n\n“Even if I found him I am afraid I shouldn’t know how to deal with him.”\n\n“Then I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll stop over with you and help you\nmake it hot for him. I’ve had a spite against thieves ever since I had a\nvaluable overcoat stolen in one of my journeys.”\n\n“I shall feel very much obliged to you, Mr. Woods, but won’t it\ninterfere with your business?”\n\n“Not materially. If we succeed in overhauling the rascal I shall feel\nsufficiently repaid for the small interruption. But come on, we can’t\nafford to linger here while he is carrying off the plunder.”\n\n“I don’t know how I can repay you, Mr. Woods,” said Rodney gratefully.\n\n“You can buy a lot of me when you get rich enough.”\n\n“I will certainly do so, though I am afraid it will be a long time\nfirst.”\n\n“You don’t know what good fortune may be in store for you. Did you\nnotice, madam, in which direction the thief went?”\n\n“Yes, I was looking out of the window. He went over the road to the\nleft.”\n\n“That leads to the village. You will see, Mr. Ropes, that I was right\nabout his plans.”\n\n“Don’t call me Mr. Ropes. Call me Rodney.”\n\n“I will. It don’t seem natural to dub a boy Mr. Now, Rodney, follow me.”\n\nThe two passengers set out on the road that led to the village. They\ncould see the latter easily, for it was not more than a mile away.\n\n“He will be surprised to think we have ‘struck his trail’ so quick,”\n said the agent.\n\n“Where shall we go first?”\n\n“To the hotel if there is one.”\n\n“The village seems small.”\n\n“Yes, there are only a few hundred inhabitant probably. It is not a\nplace where a traveler would be likely to interrupt his journey unless\nhe had a special object in doing so, like our dishonest friend. However,\nI think we shall be able to balk his little game.”\n\nTen minutes’ walk brought them to the village. Looking about they saw a\nsmall hotel just across the way from a neat white chapel.\n\n“Follow me,” said the agent.\n\nThey went into the public room in which there was a small office.\n\nThe book of arrivals was open, and Adin Woods went forward and examined\nit. Silently he pointed to a name evidently just written, for the ink\nwas scarcely dry. This was the name: Louis Wheeler, Philadelphia.\n\n“This may or may not be his real name,” said Mr. Woods in a low voice.\n\n“Do you wish to register, gentlemen?” asked the clerk.\n\n“We will take dinner, and if we decide to stay will register later. By\nthe way, I recognize this name, but it may not be the man I suppose.”\n\n“Yes, the gentleman just registered.”\n\n“Would you mind describing him?”\n\n“He was a tall, dark man as near as I can remember.”\n\n“And he carried a small casket in his hand?”\n\n“Yes, and a gripsack.”\n\n“Oh yes,” said the agent his face lighting up with satisfaction. “It is\nthe man I mean--where is he now?”\n\n“In his room.”\n\n“Did he say how long he intended to stay?”\n\n“No, sir. He said nothing about his plans.”\n\n“Did he seem specially careful about the casket?”\n\n“Yes, sir. He carried that in his hands, but let the servant carry up\nthe gripsack.”\n\n“My friend,” said the agent in an impressive tone, “I am going to\nsurprise you.”\n\nThe country clerk looked all curiosity.\n\n“Is it about Mr. Wheeler?” he asked.\n\n“Yes, the man is a thief. He stole the casket, which contains valuable\njewelry, from my young friend here. We are here to demand a return of\nthe property or to arrest him. Is there a policeman within call?”\n\n“I can summon a constable.”\n\n“Do so, but don’t breathe a word of what I have told you.”\n\nThe clerk called a boy in from the street and gave him instructions in\na low voice. He went at once on his errand, and in ten minutes a stout\nbroad shouldered man made his appearance.\n\n“This gentleman sent for you, Mr. Barlow,” said the clerk.\n\n“What can I do for you?” asked the constable.\n\n“Help me to recover stolen property.”\n\n“That I will do with pleasure if you will tell me what you want me to\ndo.”\n\nAdin Woods held a brief conference with the constable, then he led the\nway up stairs, followed immediately by Rodney, while the constable kept\na little behind.\n\n“His room is No. 9,” said the bell boy.\n\nThe agent paused before the door of No. 9, and knocked.\n\n“Come in!” said a voice.\n\nThe agent opened the door, and entered, accompanied by Rodney. A glance\nshowed that the occupant answered the description given by the lady in\nthe car.\n\nLouis Wheeler changed color, for he recognized both the agent and\nRodney.\n\n“What is your business?” he asked in a tone which he tried to make\nindifferent.\n\n“That,” answered Woods, pointing to the jewel casket on the bureau.\n\nIt looked to him as if Wheeler, if that was his name, had been trying to\nopen it.\n\n“I don’t understand.”\n\n“Then I will try to make things clear to you. You have, doubtless by\naccident” he emphasized the last word, “taken from the car a casket\nbelonging to my young friend here.”\n\n“You are mistaken, sir,” said Wheeler with brazen hardihood. “That\ncasket belongs to me.”\n\n“Indeed. What does it contain?”\n\n“I fail to see how that is any of your business,” returned Wheeler,\ndetermined, if possible, to bluff off his visitors.\n\n“I admire your cheek, sir. I really do. But I am too old a traveler to\nbe taken in by such tricks. I propose to have that casket.”\n\n“Well, sir, you are the most impudent thief and burglar I ever met. You\nbreak into a gentleman’s room, and undertake to carry off his private\nproperty. Unless you go out at once, I will have you arrested.”\n\n“That you can do very readily, for I have an officer within call.”\n\nLouis Wheeler changed color. He began to see that the situation was\ngetting serious.\n\n“There is a great mistake here,” he said.\n\n“I agree with you.”\n\nThe agent went to the door, and called “Constable Barlow.”\n\nThe constable promptly presented himself.\n\n“Do you want me, sir?” he asked.\n\n“That depends on this gentleman here. If he will peacefully restore to\nmy young friend here yonder jewel casket I am willing to let him go.\nOtherwise--” and he glanced at Wheeler significantly.\n\n“Perhaps I have made a mistake,” admitted the thief. “I had a casket\nexactly like this. Possibly I have taken the wrong one.”\n\n“I have the key to the casket here,” said Rodney, “and I can tell you\nwithout opening it what it contains.”\n\n“What did yours contain?” asked the agent.\n\n“Jewelry,” answered Wheeler shortly.\n\n“What articles?”\n\n“Never mind. I am inclined to think this casket belongs to the boy.”\n\n“Rodney, you can take it and Mr. Wheeler will probably find his where he\nleft it.”\n\nNo objection was made, and the discomfited thief was left a prey to\nmortification and disappointment.\n\nRodney handed a dollar to the constable which that worthy official\nreceived with thanks, and he and the agent resumed their journey by an\nafternoon train. They saw nothing further of Louis Wheeler who sent for\ndinner to be served in his room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nA YOUNG FINANCIAL WRECK.\n\n\n“You have been very fortunate in recovering your jewels,” said the\nagent.\n\n“I owe it to you,” replied Rodney gratefully.\n\n“Well, perhaps so. If I have rendered you a service I am very glad.”\n\n“And I am very glad to have found so good a friend. I hope you will let\nme pay for your ticket to New York.”\n\n“It won’t be necessary. The interruption of our journey won’t invalidate\nthe ticket we have.”\n\nAn hour later they reached New York.\n\n“What are your plans, Rodney?” asked Adin Woods, who by this time had\nbecome quite intimate with his young companion.\n\n“I shall call on my guardian, and perhaps he may give me some advice as\nto what I do. Where would you advise me to go--to a hotel?”\n\n“No; it will be too expensive. I know of a plain boarding house on West\nFourteenth Street where you can be accommodated with lodging and two\nmeals--breakfast and supper, or dinner as we call it here--for a dollar\na day.”\n\n“I shall be glad to go there, for the present, at least. I haven’t much\nmoney, and must find something to do as soon as possible.”\n\n“We will both go there, and if you don’t object we will take a room\ntogether. That will give us a larger apartment. Mrs. Marcy is an old\nacquaintance of mine, and will give you a welcome.”\n\nRodney was glad to accept his companion’s proposal. They proceeded at\nonce to the boarding house, and fortunately found a good room vacant on\nthe third floor. Mr. Woods went out in the evening to make a call, but\nRodney was glad to go to bed at nine o’clock.\n\nThe next morning after breakfast Rodney consulted his companion as to\nwhat he should do with the casket.\n\n“Do you want to raise money on it?” asked the agent.\n\n“No; I shall not do this unless I am obliged to.”\n\n“Have you any idea as to the value of the jewels?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Then I will take you first to a jeweler in Maiden Lane, a friend of\nmine, who will appraise them. Afterwards I advise you to deposit the\ncasket at a storage warehouse, or get Tiffany to keep it for you.”\n\n“I will do as you suggest.”\n\nMaiden Lane is a street largely devoted to jewelers, wholesale and\nretail. Rodney followed Mr. Woods into a store about midway between\nBroadway and Nassau Street. A pleasant looking man of middle age greeted\nthe agent cordially.\n\n“What can I do for you?” he asked. “Do you wish to buy a diamond ring\nfor the future Mrs. Woods?”\n\n“Not much. I would like to have you appraise some jewelry belonging to\nmy young friend here.”\n\nThe casket was opened, and the jeweler examined the contents admiringly.\n\n“This is choice jewelry,” he said. “Does your friend wish to sell?”\n\n“Not at present,” answered Rodney.\n\n“When you do give me a call. I will treat you fairly. You wish me to\nappraise these articles?”\n\n“Yes, sir, if you will.”\n\n“It will take me perhaps fifteen minutes.”\n\nThe jeweler retired to the back part of the store with the casket.\n\nIn about a quarter of an hour he returned.\n\n“Of course I can’t give exact figures,” he said, “but I value the\njewelry at about twelve hundred dollars.”\n\nRodney looked surprised.\n\n“I didn’t think it so valuable,” he said.\n\n“I don’t mean that you could sell it for so much, but if you wish to\ndispose of it I will venture to give you eleven hundred.”\n\n“Thank you. If I decide to sell I will certainly come to you.”\n\n“Now,” said the agent, “I advise you on the whole to store the casket\nwith Tiffany.”\n\n“Shall I have to pay storage in advance?” asked Rodney anxiously.\n\n“I think not. The value of the jewels will be a sufficient guarantee\nthat storage will be paid.”\n\nRodney accompanied Adin Woods to the great jewelry store on the corner\nof Fifteenth Street and Union Square, and soon transacted his business.\n\n“Now, you won’t have any anxiety as to the safety of the casket,” said\nthe agent. “Your friend of the train will find it difficult to get hold\nof the jewels. Now I shall have to leave you, as I have some business to\nattend to. We will meet at supper.”\n\nRodney decided to call at the office of his late guardian, Benjamin\nFielding. It was in the lower part of the city.\n\nOn his way down town he purchased a copy of a morning paper. Almost the\nfirst article he glanced at proved to be of especial interest to him. It\nwas headed--\n\n\nSKIPPED TO CANADA\n\nRumors have been rife for some time affecting the business standing of\nMr. Benjamin Fielding, the well known commission merchant. Yesterday\nit was discovered that he had left the city, but where he has gone is\nunknown. It is believed that he is very deeply involved, and seeing no\nway out of his embarrassment has skipped to Canada, or perhaps taken\npassage to Europe. Probably his creditors will appoint a committee to\nlook into his affairs and report what can be done.\n\nLATER--An open letter has been found in Mr. Fielding’s desk, addressed\nto his creditors. It expresses regret for their losses, and promises,\nif his life is spared, and fortune favors him, to do all in his power to\nmake them good. No one doubts Mr. Fielding’s integrity, and regrets are\nexpressed that he did not remain in the city and help unravel the tangle\nin which his affairs are involved. He is a man of ability, and as he is\nstill in the prime of life, it may be that he will be able to redeem his\npromises and pay his debts in full, if sufficient time is given him.\n\n\n“I can get no help or advice from Mr. Fielding,” thought Rodney. “I am\nthrown upon my own resources, and must fight the battle of life as well\nas I can alone.”\n\nHe got out in front of the Astor House. As he left the car he soiled his\nshoes with the mud so characteristic of New York streets.\n\n“Shine your boots?” asked a young Arab, glancing with a business eye at\nRodney’s spattered shoes.\n\nRodney accepted his offer, not so much because he thought the blacking\nwould last, as for the opportunity of questioning the free and\nindependent young citizen who was doing, what he hoped to do, that is,\nmaking a living for himself.\n\n“Is business good with you?” asked Rodney. “It ought to be with the\nstreet in this condition.”\n\n“Yes; me and de Street Commissioner is in league together. He makes\nbusiness good for me.”\n\n“And do you pay him a commission?” asked Rodney smiling.\n\n“I can’t tell no official secrets. It might be bad for me.”\n\n“You are an original genius.”\n\n“Am I? I hope you ain’t callin’ me names.”\n\n“Oh no. I am only paying you a compliment. What is your name?”\n\n“Mike Flynn.”\n\n“Were do you live, Mike?”\n\n“At the Lodge.”\n\n“I suppose you mean at the Newsboys’ ‘Lodge?’”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“How much do you have to pay there?”\n\n“Six cents for lodgin’, and six cents for supper and breakfast.”\n\n“That is, six cents for each.”\n\n“Yes; you ain’t comin’ to live there, are you?” asked Mike.\n\n“I don’t know--I may have to.”\n\n“You’re jokin’.”\n\n“What makes you think I am joking?”\n\n“Because you’re a swell. Look at them clo’es!”\n\n“I have a good suit of clothes, to be sure, but I haven’t much money.\nYou are better off than I am.”\n\n“How’s that?” asked Mike incredulously.\n\n“You’ve got work to do, and I am earning nothing.”\n\n“If you’ve got money enough to buy a box and brush, you can go in with\nme.”\n\n“I don’t think I should like it, Mike. It would spoil my clothes, and I\nam afraid I wouldn’t have money enough to buy others.”\n\n“I keep my dress suit at home--the one I wear to parties.”\n\n“Haven’t you got any father or mother, Mike? How does it happen that you\nare living in New York alone?”\n\n“My farder is dead, and me mudder, she married a man wot ain’t no good.\nHe’d bate me till I couldn’t stand it. So I just run away.”\n\n“Where does your mother live?”\n\n“In Albany.”\n\n“Some time when you earn money enough you can ask her to come here and\nlive with you.”\n\n“They don’t take women at the Lodge.”\n\n“No, I suppose not,” said Rodney, smiling.\n\n“Besides she’s got two little girls by her new husband, and she wouldn’t\nwant to leave them.”\n\nBy this time the shine was completed, and Rodney paid Mike.\n\n“If I ever come to the Lodge, I’ll ask for you,” he said.\n\n“Where do you live now?”\n\n“I’m just staying at a place on Fourteenth Street, but I can’t afford to\nstay there long, for they charge a dollar a day.”\n\n“Geewholliker, that would bust me, and make me a financial wreck as the\npapers say.”\n\n“How did you lose your fortune and get reduced to blacking boots?” asked\nRodney jocosely.\n\n“I got scooped out of it in Wall Street,” answered Mike. “Jay Gould\ncleaned me out.”\n\n“And I suppose now he has added your fortune to his.”\n\n“You’ve hit it boss.”\n\n“Well, good day, Mike, I’ll see you again some day----”\n\n“All right! I’m in my office all de mornin’.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nAN IMPUDENT ADVENTURER.\n\n\nWhile Rodney was talking with Mike Flynn he was an object of attention\nto a man who stood near the corner of Barclay Street, and was ostensibly\nlooking in at the window of the drug store. As Rodney turned away he\nrecognized him at once as his enterprising fellow traveler who had taken\npossession of the casket of jewels.\n\nHe did not care to keep up an acquaintance with him, and started to\ncross the street. But the other came forward smiling, and with a nod\nsaid: “I believe you are the young man I met yesterday in the cars and\nafterwards at Kentville?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“I just wanted to tell you that I had got back my jewel box, the one for\nwhich I mistook yours.”\n\n“Indeed!” said Rodney, who did not believe a word the fellow said.\n\n“Quite an amusing mistake, I made.”\n\n“It might have proved serious to me.”\n\n“Very true, as I shouldn’t have known where to find you to restore your\nproperty.”\n\n“I don’t think that would have troubled you much,” thought Rodney.\n“Where did you find your box?” he asked.\n\n“In the car. That is, the conductor picked it up and left it at the\ndepot for me. Where are you staying here in the city? At the Astor\nHouse?”\n\n“No, I have found a boarding house on West Fourteenth Street.”\n\n“If it is a good place, I should like to go there. What is the number?”\n\n“I can’t recall it, though I could find it,” answered Rodney with\nreserve, for he had no wish to have his railroad acquaintance in the\nhouse.\n\n“Is the gentleman who was traveling with you there also?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“He is a very pleasant gentleman, though he misjudged me. Ha, ha! my\nfriends will be very much amused when I tell them that I was taken for a\nthief. Why, I venture to say that my box is more valuable than yours.”\n\n“Very likely,” said Rodney coldly. “Good morning.”\n\n“Good morning. I hope we may meet again.”\n\nRodney nodded, but he could not in sincerity echo the wish.\n\nHe was now confronted by a serious problem. He had less than ten dollars\nin his pocketbook, and this would soon be swallowed up by the necessary\nexpenses of life in a large city. What would he do when that was gone?\n\nIt was clear that he must go to work as soon as possible. If his\nguardian had remained in the city, probably through his influence a\nsituation might have been secured. Now nothing was to be looked for in\nthat quarter.\n\nHe bought a morning paper and looked over the Want Column. He found two\nplaces within a short distance of the Astor House, and called at each.\nOne was in a railroad office.\n\n“My boy,” said the manager, a pleasant looking man, “the place was taken\nhours since. You don’t seem to get up very early in the morning.”\n\n“I could get up at any hour that was necessary,” replied Rodney, “but I\nhave only just made up my mind to apply for a position.”\n\n“You won’t meet with any luck today. It is too late. Get up bright and\nearly tomorrow morning, buy a paper, and make early application for any\nplace that strikes you as desirable.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. I am sure your advice is good.”\n\n“If you had been the first to call here, I should have taken you. I like\nyour appearance better than that of the boy I have selected.”\n\n“Thank you, sir.”\n\n“This boy may not prove satisfactory. Call in six days, just before\nhis week expires, and if there is likely to be a vacancy I will let you\nknow.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. You are very kind.”\n\n“I always sympathize with boys. I have two boys of my own.”\n\nThis conversation quite encouraged Rodney. It seemed to promise success\nin the future. If he had probably impressed one man, he might be equally\nfortunate with another.\n\nIt was about half past twelve when he passed through Nassau Street.\n\nAll at once his arm was grasped, and a cheery voice said, “Where are you\ngoing, Rodney?”\n\n“Mr. Woods!” he exclaimed, with pleased recognition.\n\n“Yes, it’s your old friend Woods.”\n\n“You are not the only railroad friend I have met this morning.”\n\n“Who was the other?”\n\n“The gentleman who obligingly took care of my jewel box for a short\ntime.”\n\n“You don’t mean to say you have met him? Where did you come across him?”\n\n“In front of the Astor House, almost two hours since.”\n\n“Did you speak to him?”\n\n“He spoke to me. You will be glad to hear that he has recovered his own\ncasket of jewels.”\n\nAdin Woods smiled.\n\n“He must think you are easily imposed upon,” he said, “to believe any\nsuch story. Anything more?”\n\n“He said his friends would be very much surprised to hear that he had\nbeen suspected of theft.”\n\n“So he wanted to clear himself with you?”\n\n“Yes; he asked where I was staying.”\n\n“I hope you didn’t tell him.”\n\n“I only said I was at a boarding house on West Fourteenth Street, but\ndidn’t mention the number.”\n\n“He thinks you have the casket with you, and that he may get possession\nof it. It is well that you stored it at Tiffany’s.”\n\n“I think so. Now I have no anxiety about it. Do you think he will find\nout where we live?”\n\n“Probably, as you gave him a clew. But, Rodney, it is about lunch time,\nand I confess I have an appetite. Come and lunch with me.”\n\n“But I am afraid, Mr. Woods, I shall not be able to return the\ncompliment.”\n\n“There is no occasion for it. I feel in good humor this morning. I have\nsold one lot, and have hopes of disposing of another. The one lot pays\nme a commission of twenty dollars.”\n\n“I wish I could make twenty dollars in a week.”\n\n“Sometimes I only sell one lot in a week. It isn’t like a regular\nbusiness. It is precarious. Still, take the year through and I make a\npretty good income. Come in here. We can get a good lunch here,” and he\nled the way into a modest restaurant, not far from the site of the old\npost office, which will be remembered by those whose residence in New\nYork dates back twenty years or more.\n\n“Now we will have a nice lunch,” said the agent. “I hope you can do\njustice to it.”\n\n“I generally can,” responded Rodney, smiling. “I am seldom troubled with\na poor appetite.”\n\n“Ditto for me. Now what have you been doing this morning?”\n\n“Looking for a place.”\n\n“With what success?”\n\n“Pretty good if I had only been earlier.”\n\nRodney told the story of his application to the manager of the railroad\noffice.\n\n“You will know better next time. I think you’ll succeed. I did. When I\ncame to New York at the age of twenty two I had only fifty dollars. That\nsmall sum had to last me twelve weeks. You can judge that I didn’t\nlive on the fat of the land during that time. I couldn’t often eat at\nDelmonico’s. Even Beefsteak John’s would have been too expensive for me.\nHowever, those old days are over.”\n\nThe next day and the two following Rodney went about the city making\napplication for positions, but every place seemed full.\n\nOn the third day Mr. Woods said, “I shall have to leave you for a week\nor more, Rodney.”\n\n“Where are you going?”\n\n“To Philadelphia. There’s a man there who is a capitalist and likes land\ninvestments. I am going to visit him, and hope to sell him several lots.\nHe once lived in this city, so he won’t object to New York investments.”\n\n“I hope you will succeed, Mr. Woods. I think if you are going away I had\nbetter give up the room, and find cheaper accommodations. I am getting\nnear the end of my money.”\n\n“You are right. It is best to be prudent.”\n\nThat evening Rodney found a room which he could rent for two dollars a\nweek. He estimated that by economy he could get along for fifty cents a\nday for his eating, and that would be a decided saving.\n\nHe was just leaving the house the next morning, gripsack in hand, when\non the steps he met Louis Wheeler, his acquaintance of the train.\n\n“Where are you going?” asked Wheeler.\n\n“I am leaving this house. I have hired a room elsewhere.”\n\nWheeler’s countenance fell, and he looked dismayed.\n\n“Why, I have just taken a room here for a week,” he said.\n\n“You will find it a good place.”\n\n“But--I wouldn’t have come here if I hadn’t thought I should have\ncompany.”\n\n“I ought to feel complimented.”\n\nRodney was convinced that Wheeler had come in the hopes of stealing\nthe casket of jewels a second time, and he felt amused at the fellow’s\ndiscomfiture.\n\n“You haven’t got your jewel box with you?”\n\n“No, I can take that another time.”\n\n“Then it’s still in the house,” thought Wheeler with satisfaction. “It\nwon’t be my fault if I don’t get it in my hands. Well, good morning,” he\nsaid. “Come around and call on me.”\n\n“Thank you!”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nAT THE NEWSBOY’S LODGING HOUSE.\n\n\nWithin a week Rodney had spent all his money, with the exception of\nabout fifty cents. He had made every effort to obtain a place, but\nwithout success.\n\nBoys born and bred in New York have within my observation tried for\nmonths to secure a position in vain, so it is not surprising that Rodney\nwho was a stranger proved equally unsuccessful.\n\nThough naturally hopeful Rodney became despondent.\n\n“There seems to be no place for me,” he said to himself. “When I was at\nboarding school I had no idea how difficult it is for a boy to earn a\nliving.”\n\nHe had one resource. He could withdraw the box of jewels from Tiffany’s,\nand sell some article that it contained. But this he had a great\nobjection to doing. One thing was evident however, he must do something.\n\nHis friend, the lot agent, was out of town, and he hardly knew whom\nto advise with. At last Mike Flynn, the friendly bootblack, whose\nacquaintance he had made in front of the Astor House, occurred to him.\n\nMike, humble as he was, was better off than himself. Moreover he was\na New York boy, and knew more about “hustling” than Rodney did. So he\nsought out Mike in his “office.”\n\n“Good morning, Mike,” said Rodney, as the bootblack was brushing off a\ncustomer.\n\n“Oh, its you, Rodney,” said Mike smiling with evident pleasure. “How\nyou’re gettin’ on?”\n\n“Not at all.”\n\n“That’s bad. Can I help you? Just say the word, and I’ll draw a check\nfor you on the Park Bank.”\n\n“Is that where you keep your money?”\n\n“It’s one of my banks. You don’t think I’d put all my spondulics in one\nbank, do you?”\n\n“I won’t trouble you to draw a check this morning. I only want to ask\nsome advice.”\n\n“I’ve got plenty of that.”\n\n“I haven’t been able to get anything to do, and I have only fifty cents\nleft. I can’t go on like that.”\n\n“That’s so.”\n\n“I’ve got to give up my room on Fourteenth Street. I can’t pay for it\nany longer. Do you think I could get in at the Lodge?”\n\n“Yes. I’ll introduce you to Mr. O’Connor.”\n\n“When shall I meet you?”\n\n“At five o’clock. We’ll be in time for supper.”\n\n“All right.”\n\nAt five o’clock Mike accompanied Rodney to the large Newsboys’ Lodging\nHouse on New Chambers Street. Mr. O’Connor, the popular and efficient\nsuperintendent, now dead, looked in surprise at Mike’s companion. He was\na stout man with a kindly face, and Rodney felt that he would prove to\nbe a friend.\n\n“Mr. O’Connor, let me introduce me friend, Mr. Rodney Ropes,” said Mike.\n\n“Could you give me a lodging?” asked Rodney in an embarrassed tone.\n\n“Yes; but I am surprised to see a boy of your appearance here.”\n\n“I am surprised to be here myself,” admitted Rodney.\n\nThe superintendent fixed upon him a shrewd, but kindly glance.\n\n“Have you run away from home?” he asked.\n\n“No, sir. It is my home that has run away from me.”\n\n“Have you parents?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“Do you come from the country?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Where have you been living?”\n\n“At a boarding school a few hours from New York.”\n\n“Why did you leave it?”\n\n“Because my guardian sent me word that he had lost my fortune, and could\nno longer pay my bills.”\n\n“You have been unfortunate truly. What do you propose to do now?”\n\n“Earn my living if I can. I have been in the city for about two weeks,\nand have applied at a good many places but in vain.”\n\n“Then you were right in coming here. Supper is ready, and although it\nis not what you are used to, it will satisfy hunger. Mike, you can take\nRodney with you.”\n\nWithin five minutes Rodney was standing at a long table with a bowl\nof coffee and a segment of bread before him. It wouldn’t have been\nattractive to one brought up to good living, as was the case with him,\nbut he was hungry.\n\nHe had eaten nothing since morning except an apple which he had bought\nat a street stand for a penny, and his stomach urgently craved a fresh\nsupply of food.\n\nMike stood next to him. The young bootblack, who was used to nothing\nbetter, ate his portion with zest, and glanced askance at Rodney to\nsee how he relished his supper. He was surprised to see that his more\naristocratic companion seemed to enjoy it quite as much as himself.\n\n“I didn’t think you’d like it,” he said.\n\n“Anything tastes good when you’re hungry, Mike.”\n\n“That’s so.”\n\n“And I haven’t eaten anything except an apple, since morning.”\n\n“Is dat so? Why didn’t you tell me? I’d have stood treat at de Boss\nTweed eatin’ house.”\n\n“I had money, but I didn’t dare to spend it. I was afraid of having\nnothing left.”\n\nWhen Rodney had eaten his supper he felt that he could have eaten more,\nbut the craving was satisfied and he felt relieved.\n\nHe looked around him with some curiosity, for he had never been in such\na motley gathering before. There were perhaps one hundred and fifty boys\nrecruited from the street, to about all of whom except himself the term\nstreet Arab might be applied.\n\nThe majority of them had the shrewd and good humored Celtic face. Many\nof them were fun loving and even mischievous, but scarcely any were\nreally bad.\n\nNaturally Rodney, with his good clothes, attracted attention. The boys\nfelt that he was not one of them, and they had a suspicion that he felt\nabove them.\n\n“Get on to de dude!” remarked one boy, who was loosely attired in a\nragged shirt and tattered trousers.\n\n“He means me, Mike,” said Rodney with a smile.\n\n“I say, Patsy Glenn, what do you mean by callin’ me friend Rodney a\ndude?” demanded Mike angrily.\n\n“Coz he’s got a dandy suit on.”\n\n“What if he has? Wouldn’t you wear one like it if you could!”\n\n“You bet!”\n\n“Then just let him alone! He’s just got back from de inauguration.”\n\n“Where’d you pick him up, Mike?”\n\n“Never mind! He’s one of us. How much money have you got in your pocket\nRodney?”\n\n“Thirty two cents.”\n\n“He can’t put on no frills wid dat money.”\n\n“That’s so. I take it all back,” and Patsy offered a begrimed hand to\nRodney, which the latter shook heartily with a pleasant smile.\n\nThat turned the tide in favor of Rodney, the boys gathered around him\nand he told his story in a few words.\n\n“I used to be rich, boys,” he said, “but my guardian spent all my money,\nand now I am as poor as any of you.”\n\n“You’d ought to have had me for your guardian, Rodney,” observed Mike.\n\n“I wish you had. You wouldn’t have lost my money for me.”\n\n“True for you! I say so, boys, if we can find Rodney’s guardian, what’ll\nwe do to him?”\n\n“Give him de grand bounce,” suggested Patsy.\n\n“Drop him out of a high winder,” said another.\n\n“What’s his name?”\n\n“I don’t care to tell you, boys. He’s written me a letter, saying he\nwill try to pay me back some day. I think he will. He isn’t a bad man,\nbut he has been unlucky.”\n\nMike, at the request of Mr. O’Connor, showed Rodney a locker in which he\ncould store such articles of clothing as he had with him. After that he\nfelt more at home, and as if he were staying at a hotel though an humble\none.\n\nAt eight o’clock some of the boys had already gone to bed, but Mike\nand Rodney were among those who remained up. Rodney noticed with what\nkindness yet fairness the superintendent managed his unruly flock.\nUnruly they might have been with a different man, but he had no trouble\nin keeping them within bounds.\n\nIt was at this time that two strangers were announced, one a New\nYork merchant named Goodnow, the other a tall, slender man with sandy\nwhiskers of the mutton chop pattern.\n\n“Good evening, Mr. Goodnow,” said the superintendent, who recognized the\nmerchant as a friend of the society.\n\n“Good evening, Mr. O’Connor. I have brought my friend and correspondent\nMr. Mulgrave, of London, to see some of your young Arabs.”\n\n“I shall be glad to give him all the opportunity he desires.”\n\nThe Englishman looked curiously at the faces of the boys who in turn\nwere examining him with equal interest.\n\n“They are not unlike our boys of a similar grade, but seem sharper and\nmore intelligent,” he said. “But surely,” pointing to Rodney, “that boy\nis not one of the--Arabs. Why, he looks like a young gentleman.”\n\n“He is a new comer. He only appeared tonight.”\n\n“He must have a history. May I speak with him?”\n\n“By all means. Rodney, this gentleman would like to talk with you.”\n\nRodney came forward with the ease of a boy who was accustomed to good\nsociety, and said: “I shall be very happy to speak with him.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nRODNEY FINDS A PLACE.\n\n\n“Surely,” said the Englishman, “you were not brought up in the street?”\n\n“Oh, no,” answered Rodney, “I was more fortunate.”\n\n“Then how does it happen that I find you here--among the needy boys of\nthe city?”\n\n“Because I am needy, too.”\n\n“But you were not always poor?”\n\n“No; I inherited a moderate fortune from my father. It was only within a\nshort time that I learned from my guardian that it was lost. I left the\nboarding school where I was being educated, and came to the city to try\nto make a living.”\n\n“But surely your guardian would try to provide for you?”\n\n“He is no longer in the city.”\n\n“Who was he?” asked Otis Goodnow.\n\n“Mr. Benjamin Fielding.”\n\n“Is it possible? Why, I lost three thousand dollars by him. He has\ntreated you shamefully.”\n\n“It was not intentional, I am sure,” said Rodney. “He was probably drawn\ninto using my money by the hope of retrieving himself. He wrote me that\nhe hoped at some time to make restitution.”\n\n“You speak of him generously, my lad,” said Mr. Mulgrave. “Yet he has\nbrought you to absolute poverty.”\n\n“Yes, sir, and I won’t pretend that it is not a hard trial to me, but if\nI can get a chance to earn my own living, I will not complain.”\n\n“Goodnow, a word with you,” said the Englishman, and he drew his friend\naside. “Can’t you make room for this boy in your establishment?”\n\nOtis Goodnow hesitated. “At present there is no vacancy,” he said.\n\n“Make room for him, and draw upon me for his wages for the first six\nmonths.”\n\n“I will do so, but before the end of that time I am sure he will justify\nmy paying him out of my own pocket.”\n\nThere was a little further conference, and then the two gentlemen came\nup to where Rodney was standing with Mr. O’Connor.\n\n“My boy,” said Mr. Mulgrave, “my friend here will give you a place at\nfive dollars a week. Will that satisfy you?”\n\nRodney’s face flushed with pleasure.\n\n“It will make me very happy,” he said.\n\n“Come round to my warehouse--here is my business card--tomorrow\nmorning,” said the merchant. “Ask to see me.”\n\n“At what time shall I call, sir?”\n\n“At half past nine o’clock. That is for the first morning. When you get\nto work you will have to be there at eight.”\n\n“There will be no trouble about that, sir.”\n\n“Now it is my turn,” said the Englishman. “Here are five dollars to keep\nyou till your first week’s wages come due. I dare say you will find them\nuseful.”\n\n“Thank you very much, sir. I was almost out of money.”\n\nAfter the two gentlemen left the Lodging House Rodney looked at the card\nand found that his new place of employment was situated on Reade Street\nnot far from Broadway.\n\n“It’s you that’s in luck, Rodney,” said his friend Mike. “Who’d think\nthat a gentleman would come to the Lodging House to give you a place?”\n\n“Yes, I am in luck, Mike, and now I’m going to make you a proposal.”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Why can’t we take a room together? It will be better than living here.”\n\n“Sure you wouldn’t room with a poor boy like me?”\n\n“Why shouldn’t I? You are a good friend, and I should like your company.\nBesides I mean to help you get an education. I suppose you’re not a\nfirst class scholar, Mike?”\n\n“About fourth class, I guess, Rodney.”\n\n“Then you shall study with me. Then when you know a little more you may\nget a chance to get out of your present business, and get into a store.”\n\n“That will be bully!” said Mike with pleasure.\n\n“Now we’d better go to bed; I must be up bright and early in the\nmorning. We’ll engage a room before I go to work.”\n\nThere was no difficulty about rising early. It is one of the rules\nof the Lodging House for the boys to rise at six o’clock, and after\na frugal breakfast of coffee and rolls they are expected to go out to\ntheir business whatever it may be. Mike and Rodney dispensed with the\nregulation breakfast and went out to a restaurant on Park Row where they\nfared better.\n\n“Now where shall we go for a room?” asked Rodney.\n\n“There’s a feller I know has a good room on Bleecker Street,” said Mike.\n\n“How far is that?”\n\n“A little more’n a mile.”\n\n“All right! Let us go and see.”\n\nBleecker Street once stood in better repute than at present. It is said\nthat A. T. Stewart once made his home there. Now it is given over to\nshops and cheap lodging houses.\n\nFinally the boys found a room decently furnished, about ten feet square,\nof which the rental was two dollars and a half per week. Mike succeeded\nin beating down the lodging house keeper to two dollars, and at that\nfigure they engaged it.\n\n“When will you come?” asked Mrs. McCarty.\n\n“Right off,” said Mike.\n\n“I’ll need a little time to put it in order.”\n\n“Me and my partner will be at our business till six o’clock,” returned\nMike.\n\n“You can send in your trunks during the day if you like.”\n\n“My trunk is at the Windsor Hotel,” said Mike. “I’ve lent it to a friend\nfor a few days.”\n\nMrs. McCarty looked at Mike with a puzzled expression. She was one of\nthose women who are slow to comprehend a joke, and she could not quite\nmake it seem natural that her new lodger, who was in rather neglige\ncostume, should be a guest at a fashionable hotel.\n\n“I will leave my valise,” said Rodney, “and will send for my trunk. It\nis in the country.”\n\nMike looked at him, not feeling quite certain whether he was in earnest,\nbut Rodney was perfectly serious.\n\n“You’re better off than me,” said Mike, when they reached the street.\n“If I had a trunk I wouldn’t have anything to put into it.”\n\n“I’ll see if I can’t rig you out, Mike. I’ve got a good many clothes,\nbought when I was rich. You and I are about the same size. I’ll give you\na suit of clothes to wear on Sundays.”\n\n“Will you?” exclaimed Mike, his face showing pleasure. “I’d like to see\nhow I look in good clo’es. I never wore any yet. It wouldn’t do no good\nin my business.”\n\n“You won’t want to wear them when at work. But wouldn’t you like to\nchange your business?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Have you ever tried?”\n\n“What’d be the use of tryin’? They’d know I was a bootblack in these\nclo’es.”\n\n“When you wear a better suit you can go round and try your luck.”\n\n“I’d like to,” said Mike wistfully. “I don’t want you to tell at the\nstore that you room with a bootblack.”\n\n“It isn’t that I think of, Mike. I want you to do better. I’m going to\nmake a man of you.”\n\n“I hope you are. Sometimes I’ve thought I’d have to be a bootblack\nalways. When do you think you’ll get the clo’es?”\n\n“I shall write to the principal of the boarding school at once, asking\nhim to forward my trunk by express. I want to economize a little this\nweek, and shall have to pay the express charges.”\n\n“I’ll pay up my part of the rent, Rodney, a quarter a day.”\n\nRodney had advanced the whole sum, as Mike was not in funds.\n\n“If you can’t pay a dollar a week I will pay a little more than half.”\n\n“There ain’t no need. I’ll pay my half and be glad to have a nice room.”\n\n“I’ve got three or four pictures at the school, and some books. I’ll\nsend for them later on, and we’ll fix up the room.”\n\n“Will you? We’ll have a reg’lar bang up place. I tell you that’ll be\nbetter than livin’ at the Lodge.”\n\n“Still that seems a very neat place. It is lucky for poor boys that they\ncan get lodging so cheap.”\n\n“But it isn’t like havin’ a room of your own, Rodney. I say, when we’re\nall fixed I’ll ask some of me friends to come in some evenin’ and take a\nlook at us. They’ll be s’prised.”\n\n“Certainly, Mike. I shall be glad to see any of your friends.”\n\nIt may seem strange that Rodney, carefully as he had been brought up,\nshould have made a companion of Mike, but he recognized in the warm\nhearted Irish boy, illiterate as he was, sterling qualities, and he felt\ndesirous of helping to educate him. He knew that he could always depend\non his devoted friendship, and looked forward with pleasure to their\nmore intimate companionship.\n\nAfter selecting their room and making arrangements to take possession of\nit, the boys went down town. Rodney stepped into the reading room at the\nAstor House and wrote the following letter to Dr. Sampson:\n\n\nDR. PLINY SAMPSON:\n\nDEAR SIR--Will you be kind enough to send my trunk by express to No. 312\nBleecker Street? I have taken a room there, and that will be my home for\nthe present. I have obtained a position in a wholesale house on Reade\nStreet, and hope I may give satisfaction. Will you remember me with best\nwishes to all the boys? I don’t expect to have so easy or pleasant a\ntime as I had at school, but I hope to get on, and some time--perhaps in\nthe summer--to make you a short visit.\n\nYours truly, RODNEY ROPES.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHE FIRST DAY AT WORK.\n\n\nA little before half past nine Rodney paused in front of a large five\nstory building on Reade Street occupied by Otis Goodnow.\n\nHe entered and found the first floor occupied by quite a large number of\nclerks and salesmen, and well filled with goods.\n\n“Well, young fellow, what can I do for you?” asked a dapper looking\nclerk.\n\n“I would like to see Mr. Goodnow.”\n\n“He’s reading his letters. He won’t see you.”\n\nRodney was provoked.\n\n“Do you decide who is to see him?” he asked.\n\n“You’re impudent, young feller.”\n\n“Am I? Perhaps you will allow Mr. Goodnow to see me, as long as he told\nme to call here this morning.”\n\n“That’s a different thing,” returned the other in a different tone. “If\nyou’re sure about that you can go to the office in the back part of the\nroom.”\n\nRodney followed directions and found himself at the entrance of a room\nwhich had been partitioned off for the use of the head of the firm.\n\nMr. Goodnow was seated at a desk with his back to him, and was employed\nin opening letters. Without turning round he said, “Sit down and I will\nattend to you in a few minutes.”\n\nRodney seated himself on a chair near the door. In about ten minutes Mr.\nGoodnow turned around.\n\n“Who is it?” he asked.\n\n“Perhaps you remember telling me to call at half past nine. You saw me\nat the Newsboys’ Lodging House.”\n\n“Ah, yes, I remember. I promised my friend Mulgrave that I would give\nyou a place. What can you do? Are you a good writer?”\n\n“Shall I give you a specimen of my handwriting?”\n\n“Yes; sit down at that desk.”\n\nIt was a desk adjoining his own.\n\nRodney seated himself and wrote in a firm, clear, neat hand:\n\n“I will endeavor to give satisfaction, if you are kind enough to give me\na place in your establishment.”\n\nThen he passed over the paper to the merchant.\n\n“Ah, very good!” said Mr. Goodnow approvingly. “You won’t be expected\nto do any writing yet but I like to take into my store those who are\nqualified for promotion.”\n\nHe rang a little bell on his desk.\n\nA boy about two years older than Rodney answered the summons.\n\n“Send Mr. James here,” said the merchant.\n\nMr. James, a sandy complexioned man, partially bald, made his\nappearance.\n\n“Mr. James,” said the merchant, “I have taken this boy into my employ.\nI don’t know if one is needed, but it is at the request of a friend. You\ncan send him on errands, or employ him in any other way.”\n\n“Very well, sir. I can find something for him to do today at any rate,\nas young Johnson hasn’t shown up.”\n\n“Very well. Whats your name, my lad?”\n\n“Rodney Ropes.”\n\n“Make a note of his name, Mr. James, and enter it in the books. You may\ngo with Mr. James, and put yourself at his disposal.”\n\nRodney followed the subordinate, who was the head of one of the\ndepartments, to the second floor. Here Mr. James had a desk.\n\n“Wait a minute,” he said, “and I will give you a memorandum of places to\ncall at.”\n\nIn five minutes a memorandum containing a list of three places was given\nto Rodney, with brief instructions as to what he was to do at each. They\nwere places not far away, and fortunately Rodney had a general idea as\nto where they were.\n\nIn his search for positions he had made a study of the lower part of the\ncity which now stood him in good stead.\n\nAs he walked towards the door he attracted the attention of the young\nclerk with whom he had just spoken.\n\n“Well, did you see Mr. Goodnow?” asked the young man, stroking a sickly\nlooking mustache.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Has he taken you into the firm?”\n\n“Not yet, but he has given me a place.”\n\nThe clerk whistled.\n\n“So you are one of us?” he said.\n\n“Yes,” answered Rodney with a smile.\n\n“Then you ought to know the rules of the house.”\n\n“You can tell me later on, but now I am going out on an errand.”\n\nIn about an hour Rodney returned. He had been detained at two of the\nplaces where he called.\n\n“Do you remember what I said?” asked the young clerk as he passed.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“The first rule of the establishment is for a new hand to treat ME on\nhis first day.”\n\n“That’s pretty good for you,” said Rodney, laughing; “I shall have to\nwait till my pay is raised.”\n\nAbout the middle of the afternoon, as Rodney was helping to unpack a\ncrate of goods, the older boy whom he had already seen in the office\nbelow, walked up to him and said, “Is your name Ropes?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You are wanted in Mr. Goodnow’s office.”\n\nRodney went down stairs, feeling a little nervous. Had he done wrong,\nand was he to be reprimanded?\n\nHe could think of nothing deserving censure. So far as he knew he had\nattended faithfully to all the duties required of him.\n\nAs he entered the office, he saw that Mr. Goodnow had a visitor, whose\nface looked familiar to him. He recalled it immediately as the face of\nthe English gentleman who had visited the Lodging House the day previous\nwith his employer.\n\n“So I find you at work?” he said, offering his hand with a smile.\n\n“Yes, sir,” answered Rodney gratefully, “thanks to you.”\n\n“How do you think you will like it?”\n\n“Very much, sir. It is so much better than going around the street with\nnothing to do.”\n\n“I hope you will try to give satisfaction to my friend, Mr. Goodnow.”\n\n“I shall try to do so, sir.”\n\n“You mustn’t expect to rise to be head salesman in a year. Festina\nlente, as the Latin poet has it.”\n\n“I shall be satisfied with hastening slowly, sir.”\n\n“What! you understand Latin?”\n\n“Pretty well, sir.”\n\n“Upon my word, I didn’t expect to find a boy in the News boys’ Lodging\nHouse with classical attainments. Perhaps you know something of Greek\nalso!” he said doubtfully.\n\nIn reply Rodney repeated the first line of the Iliad.\n\n“Astonishing!” exclaimed Mr. Mulgrave, putting up his eyeglass, and\nsurveying Rodney as if he were a curious specimen. “You don’t happen to\nknow anything of Sanscrit, do you?”\n\n“No, sir; I confess my ignorance.”\n\n“I apprehend you won’t require it in my friend Goodnow’s establishment.”\n\n“If I do, I will learn it,” said Rodney, rather enjoying the joke.\n\n“If I write a book about America, I shall certainly put in a paragraph\nabout a learned office boy. I think you are entitled to something for\nyour knowledge of Greek and Latin--say five dollars apiece,” and Mr.\nMulgrave drew from his pocket two gold pieces and handed them to Rodney.\n\n“Thank you very much, sir,” said Rodney. “I shall find this money very\nuseful, as I have taken a room, and am setting up housekeeping.”\n\n“Then you have left the Lodging House?”\n\n“Yes, sir; I only spent one night there.”\n\n“You are right. It is no doubt a great blessing to the needy street\nboys, but you belong to a different class.”\n\n“It is very fortunate I went there last evening, or I should not have\nmet you and Mr. Goodnow.”\n\n“I am glad to have been the means of doing you a service,” said the\nEnglishman kindly, shaking hands with Rodney, who bowed and went back to\nhis work.\n\n“I am not sure but you are taking too much notice of that boy,\nMulgrave,” said the merchant.\n\n“No fear! He is not a common boy. You won’t regret employing him.”\n\n“I hope not.”\n\nThen they talked of other matters, for Mr. Mulgrave was to start on his\nreturn to England the following day.\n\nAt five o’clock Rodney’s day was over, and he went back to Bleecker\nStreet. He found Mike already there, working hard to get his hands\nclean, soiled as they were by the stains of blacking.\n\n“Did you have a good day, Mike?” asked Rodney.\n\n“Yes; I made a dollar and ten cents. Here’s a quarter towards the rent.”\n\n“All right! I see you are prompt in money matters.”\n\n“I try to be. Do you know, Rodney, I worked better for feelin’ that I\nhad a room of my own to go to after I got through. I hope I’ll soon be\nable to get into a different business.”\n\n“I hope so, too.”\n\nTwo days later Rodney’s trunk arrived. In the evening he opened it.\nHe took out a dark mixed suit about half worn, and said, “Try that on,\nMike.”\n\nMike did so. It fitted as if it were made for him.\n\n“You can have it, Mike,” said Rodney.\n\n“You don’t mean it?” exclaimed Mike, delighted.\n\n“Yes, I do. I have plenty of others.”\n\nRodney supplemented his gift by a present of underclothing, and on the\nfollowing Sunday the two boys went to Central Park in the afternoon,\nMike so transformed that some of his street friends passed him without\nrecognition, much to Mike’s delight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nMIKE PUTS ON A UNIFORM.\n\n\nA wonderful change came over Mike Flynn. Until he met Rodney he seemed\nquite destitute of ambition. The ragged and dirty suit which he wore as\nbootblack were the best he had. His face and hands generally bore the\nmarks of his business, and as long as he made enough to buy three meals\na day, two taken at the Lodging House, with something over for lodging,\nand an occasional visit to a cheap theater, he was satisfied.\n\nHe was fifteen, and had never given a thought to what he would do when\nhe was older. But after meeting Rodney, and especially after taking\na room with him, he looked at life with different eyes. He began to\nunderstand that his business, though honorable because honest, was not\na desirable one. He felt, too, that he ought to change it out of regard\nfor Rodney, who was now his close companion.\n\n“If I had ten dollars ahead,” he said one day, “I’d give up blackin’\nboots.”\n\n“What else would you do?”\n\n“I’d be a telegraph boy. That’s more respectable than blackin’ boots,\nand it ‘ould be cleaner.”\n\n“That is true. Do you need money to join?”\n\n“I would get paid once in two weeks, and I’d have to live till I got my\nfirst salary.”\n\n“I guess I can see you through, Mike.”\n\n“No; you need all your money, Rodney. I’ll wait and see if I can’t save\nit myself.”\n\nThis, however, would have taken a long time, if Mike had not been\nfavored by circumstances. He was standing near the ladies’ entrance to\nthe Astor House one day, when casting his eyes downward he espied a\nneat pocketbook of Russia leather. He picked it up, and from the feeling\njudged that it must be well filled.\n\nNow I must admit that it did occur to Mike that he could divert to his\nown use the contents without detection, as no one had seen him pick it\nup. But Mike was by instinct an honest boy, and he decided that this\nwould not be right. He thrust it into his pocket, however, as he had no\nobjection to receiving a reward if one was offered.\n\nWhile he was standing near the entrance, a tall lady, dressed in brown\nsilk and wearing glasses, walked up from the direction of Broadway. She\nbegan to peer about like one who was looking for something.\n\n“I guess its hers,” thought Mike.\n\n“Are you looking for anything, ma’am?” he asked.\n\nShe turned and glanced at Mike.\n\n“I think I must have dropped my pocketbook,” she said. “I had it in my\nhand when I left the hotel, but I had something on my mind and I think\nI must have dropped it without noticing. Won’t you help me look for it,\nfor I am short sighted?”\n\n“Is this it?” asked Mike, producing the pocketbook.\n\n“Oh yes!” exclaimed the lady joyfully. “Where did you find it?”\n\n“Just here,” answered Mike, indicating a place on the sidewalk.\n\n“I suppose there is a good deal of money in it?” said Mike, with\npardonable curiosity.\n\n“Then you didn’t open it?”\n\n“No, ma’am, I didn’t have a chance. I just found it.”\n\n“There may be forty or fifty dollars, but it isn’t on that account I\nshould have regretted losing it. It contained a receipt for a thousand\ndollars which I am to use in a law suit. That is very important for it\nwill defeat a dishonest claim for money that I have already paid.”\n\n“Then I’m glad I found it.”\n\n“You are an honest boy. You seem to be a poor boy also.”\n\n“That’s true, ma’am. If I was rich I wouldn’t black boots for a livin’.”\n\n“Dear me, you are one of the young street Arabs I’ve read about,” and\nthe lady looked curiously at Mike through her glasses.\n\n“I expect I am.”\n\n“And I suppose you haven’t much money.”\n\n“My bank account is very low, ma’am.”\n\n“I’ve read a book about a boy named ‘Ragged Dick.’ I think he was a\nbootblack, too. Do you know him?”\n\n“He’s my cousin, ma’am,” answered Mike promptly.\n\nIt will be observed that I don’t represent Mike as possessed of all the\nvirtues.\n\n“Dear me, how interesting. I bought the book for my little nephew. Now I\ncan tell him I have seen ‘Ragged Dick’s’ cousin. Where is Dick now?”\n\n“He’s reformed, ma’am.”\n\n“Reformed?”\n\n“Yes, from blackin’ boots. He’s in better business now.”\n\n“If I should give you some of the money in this pocketbook, you wouldn’t\nspend it on drinking and gambling, would you?”\n\n“No, ma’am. I’d reform like my cousin, Ragged Dick.”\n\n“You look like a good truthful boy. Here are ten dollars for you.”\n\n“Oh, thank you, ma’am! you’re a gentleman,” said Mike overjoyed. “No, I\ndon’t mean that but I hope you’ll soon get a handsome husband.”\n\n“My young friend, I don’t care to marry, though I appreciate your good\nwishes. I am an old maid from principle. I am an officer of the Female\nSuffrage Association.”\n\n“Is it a good payin’ office, ma’am?” asked Mike, visibly impressed.\n\n“No, but it is a position of responsibility. Please tell me your name\nthat I may make a note of it.”\n\n“My name is Michael Flynn.”\n\n“I see. You are of Celtic extraction.”\n\n“I don’t know, ma’am. I never heard that I was. It isn’t anything bad,\nis it?”\n\n“Not at all. I have some Celtic blood in my own veins. If you ever come\nto Boston you can inquire for Miss Pauline Peabody.”\n\n“Thank you, ma’am,” said Mike, who thought the lady rather a “queer\nlot.”\n\n“Now I must call upon my lawyer, and leave the receipt which I came so\nnear losing.”\n\n“Well, I’m in luck,” thought Mike. “I’ll go home and dress up, and apply\nfor a position as telegraph boy.”\n\nWhen Rodney came home at supper time he found Mike, dressed in his\nSunday suit.\n\n“What’s up now, Mike?” he asked. “Have you retired from business?”\n\n“Yes, from the bootblack business. Tomorrow I shall be a telegraph boy.”\n\n“That is good. You haven’t saved up ten dollars, have you?”\n\n“I saved up two, and a lady gave me ten dollars for findin’ her\npocketbook.”\n\n“That’s fine, Mike.”\n\nThere chanced to be a special demand for telegraph boys at that time,\nand Mike, who was a sharp lad, on passing the necessary examination, was\nat once set to work.\n\nHe was immensely fond of his blue uniform when he first put it on, and\nfelt that he had risen in the social scale. True, his earnings did not\naverage as much, but he was content with smaller pay, since the duties\nwere more agreeable.\n\nIn the evenings under Rodney’s instruction he devoted an hour and\nsometimes two to the task of making up the deficiencies in his early\neducation. These were extensive, but Mike was naturally a smart boy, and\nafter a while began to improve rapidly.\n\nSo three months passed. Rodney stood well in with Mr. Goodnow, and\nwas promoted to stock clerk. The discipline which he had revived as\na student stood him in good stead, and enabled him to make more rapid\nadvancement than some who had been longer in the employ of the firm. In\nparticular he was promoted over the head of Jasper Redwood, a boy two\nyears older than himself, who was the nephew of an old employee who had\nbeen for fifteen years in the house.\n\nJasper’s jealousy was aroused, and he conceived a great dislike for\nRodney, of which Rodney was only partially aware.\n\nFor this dislike there was really no cause. Rodney stood in his way only\nbecause Jasper neglected his duties, and failed to inspire confidence.\nHe was a boy who liked to spend money and found his salary insufficient,\nthough he lived with his uncle and paid but two dollars a week for his\nboard.\n\n“Uncle James,” he said one day, “when do you think I will get a raise?”\n\n“You might get one now if it were not for the new boy.”\n\n“You mean Ropes.”\n\n“Yes, he has just been promoted to a place which I hoped to get for\nyou.”\n\n“It is mean,” grumbled Jasper. “I have been here longer than he.”\n\n“True, but he seems to be Mr. Goodnow’s pet. It was an unlucky day for\nyou when he got a place in the establishment.”\n\n“Did you ask Mr. Goodnow to promote me?”\n\n“Yes, but he said he had decided to give Archer’s place to Ropes.”\n\nArcher was a young clerk who was obliged, on account of pulmonary\nweakness, to leave New York and go to Southern California.\n\n“How much does Ropes get now?”\n\n“Seven dollars a week.”\n\n“And I only get five, and I am two years older. They ought to have more\nregard for you, Uncle James, or I, as your nephew, would get promoted.”\n\n“I will see what we can do about it.”\n\n“I wish Ropes would get into some scrape and get discharged.”\n\nIt was a new idea, but Jasper dwelt upon it, and out of it grew trouble\nfor Rodney.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nMISSING GOODS.\n\n\nJames Redwood was summoned one morning to the counting room of his\nemployer.\n\n“Mr. Redwood,” said the merchant “I have reason to think that one of my\nclerks is dishonest.”\n\n“Who, sir?”\n\n“That is what I want you to find out.”\n\n“What reason have you for suspecting any one?”\n\n“Some ladies’ cloaks and some dress patterns are missing.”\n\n“Are you sure they were not sold?”\n\n“Yes: the record of sales has been examined, and they are not included.”\n\n“That is strange, Mr. Goodnow,” said Redwood thoughtfully. “I hope I am\nnot under suspicion.”\n\n“Oh, not at all.”\n\n“The losses seem to have taken place in my department.”\n\n“True, but that doesn’t involve you.”\n\n“What do you want me to do?”\n\n“Watch those under you. Let nothing in your manner, however, suggest\nthat you are suspicious. I don’t want you to put any one on his guard.”\n\n“All right, sir. I will be guided by your instructions. Have you any\nidea how long this has been going on?”\n\n“Only a few weeks.”\n\nMr. Redwood turned to go back to his room, but Mr. Goodnow called him\nback.\n\n“I needn’t suggest to you,” he said, “that you keep this to yourself.\nDon’t let any clerk into the secret.”\n\n“Very well, sir.”\n\nJames Redwood, however, did not keep his promise. After supper he called\nback Jasper as he was about putting on his hat to go out, and said,\n“Jasper, I wish to speak with you for five minutes.”\n\n“Won’t it do tomorrow morning? I have an engagement.”\n\n“Put it off, then. This is a matter of importance.”\n\n“Very well, sir,” and Jasper, albeit reluctantly, laid down his hat and\nsat down.\n\n“Jasper,” said his uncle, “there’s a thief in our establishment.”\n\nJasper started, and his sallow complexion turned yellower than usual.\n\n“What do you mean, uncle?” he asked nervously.\n\n“What I say. Some articles are missing that have not been sold.”\n\n“Such as what?”\n\n“Ladies’ cloaks and dress patterns.”\n\n“Who told you?” asked Jasper in a low tone.\n\n“Mr. Goodnow.”\n\n“What the boss?”\n\n“Certainly.”\n\n“How should he know?”\n\n“I didn’t inquire, and if I had he probably wouldn’t have told me. The\nmain thing is that he does know.”\n\n“He may not be sure.”\n\n“He is not a man to speak unless he feels pretty sure.”\n\n“I don’t see how any one could steal the articles without being\ndetected.”\n\n“It seems they are detected.”\n\n“Did--did Mr. Goodnow mention any names?”\n\n“No. He wants to watch and find out the thief. I wish you to help me,\nthough I am acting against instructions. Mr. Goodnow asked me to take\nno one into my confidence. You will see, therefore, that it will be\nnecessary for you to say nothing.”\n\n“I won’t breathe a word,” said Jasper, who seemed to feel more at ease.\n\n“Now that I have told you so much, can you suggest any person who would\nbe likely to commit the theft?”\n\nJasper remained silent for a moment, then with a smile of malicious\nsatisfaction said, “Yes, I can suggest a person.”\n\n“Who is it?”\n\n“The new boy, Rodney Ropes.”\n\nJames Redwood shook his head.\n\n“I can’t believe that it is he. I am not in love with the young fellow,\nwho seems to stand in the way of your advancement but he seems straight\nenough, and I don’t think it at all likely that he should be the guilty\nperson.”\n\n“Yes, Uncle James, he SEEMS straight but you know that still waters run\ndeep.”\n\n“Have you seen anything that would indicate guilt on his part?”\n\n“I have noticed this, that, he is very well dressed for a boy of his\nsmall salary, and seems always to have money to spend.”\n\n“That will count for something. Still he might have some outide means.\nHave you noticed anything else?”\n\nJasper hesitated.\n\n“I noticed one evening when he left the store that he had a sizable\nparcel under his arm.”\n\n“And you think it might have contained some article stolen from the\nstock?”\n\n“That’s just what I think now. Nothing of the kind occurred to me at\nthat time, for I didn’t know any articles were missing.”\n\n“That seems important. When was it that you noticed this?”\n\n“One day last week,” answered Jasper hesitatingly.\n\n“Can you remember the day?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Couldn’t you fix it some way?”\n\n“No. You see, I didn’t attach any particular importance to it at the\ntime, and probably it would not have occurred to me again, but for your\nmentioning that articles were missing.”\n\n“There may be something in what you say,” said his uncle thoughtfully.\n“I will take special notice of young Ropes after this.”\n\n“So will I.”\n\n“Don’t let him observe that he is watched. It would defeat our chances\nof detecting the thief.”\n\n“I’ll be careful. Do you want to say anything more, uncle?”\n\n“No. By the way, where were you going this evening?”\n\n“I was going to meet a friend, and perhaps go to the theater. You\ncouldn’t lend me a dollar, could you, Uncle James?”\n\n“Yes, I could, but you are not quite able to pay for your own pleasures.\nIt costs all my salary to live, and its going to be worse next year, for\nI shall have to pay a higher rent.”\n\n“When I have my pay raised, I can get along better.”\n\n“If Ropes loses his place, you will probably step into it.”\n\n“Then I hope he’ll go, and that soon.”\n\nWhen Jasper passed through the front door and stood on the sidewalk, he\nbreathed a sigh of relief.\n\n“So, they are on to us,” he said to himself. “But how was it found\nout? That’s what I’d like to know. I have been very careful. I must see\nCarton at once.”\n\nA short walk took him to a billiard room not far from Broadway. A young\nman of twenty five, with a slight mustache, and a thin, dark face, was\nselecting a cue.\n\n“Ah, Jasper!” he said. “Come at last. Let us have a game of pool.”\n\n“Not just yet. Come outide. I want to speak to you.”\n\nJasper looked serious, and Philip Carton, observing it, made no\nremonstrance, but taking his hat, followed him out.\n\n“Well, what is it?” he asked.\n\n“Something serious. It is discovered at the store that goods are\nmissing.”\n\n“You don’t mean it? Are we suspected?”\n\n“No one is suspected--yet.”\n\n“But how do you know?”\n\n“My uncle spoke to me about it this evening--just after supper.”\n\n“He doesn’t think you are in it.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“How did he find out?”\n\n“Through the boss. Goodnow spoke to him about it today.”\n\n“But how should Goodnow know anything about it?”\n\n“That no one can tell but himself. He asked Uncle James to watch the\nclerks, and see if he could fasten the theft on any of them.”\n\n“That is pleasant for us. It is well we are informed so that we can be\non our guard. I am afraid our game is up.”\n\n“For the present at any rate we must suspend operations. Now, have you\nsome money for me?”\n\n“Well, a little.”\n\n“A little? Why there are two cloaks and a silk dress pattern to be\naccounted for.”\n\n“True, but I have to be very careful. I have to submit to a big discount\nfor the parties I sell to undoubtedly suspect that the articles are\nstolen.”\n\n“Wouldn’t it be better to pawn them?”\n\n“It would be more dangerous. Besides you know how liberal pawnbrokers\nare. I’ll tell you what would be better. If I had a sufficient number of\narticles to warrant it, I could take them on to Boston or Philadelphia,\nand there would be less risk selling them there.”\n\n“That is true. I wish we had thought of that before. Now we shall have\nto give up the business for a time. How much money have you got for me?”\n\n“Seven dollars.”\n\n“Seven dollars!” exclaimed Jasper in disgust. “Why, that is ridiculous.\nThe articles must have been worth at retail a hundred dollars.”\n\n“Perhaps so, but I only got fourteen for them. If you think you can do\nany better you may sell them yourself next time.”\n\n“I thought I should assuredly get fifteen dollars out of it,” said\nJasper, looking deeply disappointed. “I had a use for the money too.”\n\n“Very likely. So had I.”\n\n“Well, I suppose I must make it do. Listen and I will tell you how I\nthink I can turn this thing to my advantage.”\n\n“Go ahead!”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\nWHAT WAS FOUND IN RODNEY’S ROOM.\n\n\n“There is a boy who stands between me and promotion,” continued Jasper,\nspeaking in a low tone.\n\n“The boy you mentioned the other day?”\n\n“Yes, Rodney Ropes. Mr. Goodnow got him from I don’t know where, and has\ntaken a ridiculous fancy to him. He has been put over my head and his\npay raised, though I have been in the store longer than he. My idea is\nto connect him with the thefts and get him discharged.”\n\n“Do you mean that we are to make him a confederate?”\n\n“No,” answered Jasper impatiently. “He would be just the fellow to peach\nand get us all into trouble.”\n\n“Then what do you mean?”\n\n“To direct suspicion towards him. We won’t do it immediately, but within\na week or two. It would do me good to have him turned out of the store.”\n\nJasper proceeded to explain his idea more fully, and his companion\npronounced it very clever.\n\nMeanwhile Rodney, not suspecting the conspiracy to deprive him of his\nplace and his good name, worked zealously, encouraged by his promotion,\nand resolved to make a place for himself which should insure him a\npermanent connection with the firm.\n\nTen days passed, and Mr. Redwood again received a summons from the\noffice.\n\nEntering, he found Mr. Goodnow with a letter in his hand.\n\n“Well, Mr. Redwood,” he began, “have you got any clew to the party who\nhas stolen our goods?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“Has any thing been taken since I spoke with you on the subject?”\n\n“Not that I am aware of.”\n\n“Has any one of the clerks attracted your attention by suspicious\nconduct?”\n\n“No, sir,” answered Redwood, puzzled.\n\n“Humph! Cast your eye over this letter.”\n\nJames Redwood took the letter, which was written in a fine hand, and\nread as follow:\n\n\nMR. GOODNOW:\n\nDEAR SIR,--I don’t know whether you are aware that articles have been\ntaken from your stock, say, ladies’ cloaks and silk dress patterns,\nand disposed of outside. I will not tell you how it has come to my\nknowledge, for I do not want to get any one’s ill will, but I will say,\nto begin with, that they were taken by one of your employees, and the\none, perhaps, that you would least suspect, for I am told that he is\na favorite of yours. I may as well say that it is Rodney Ropes. I live\nnear him, and last evening I saw him carry a bundle to his room when he\nwent back from the store. I think if you would send round today when he\nis out, you would find in his room one or more of the stolen articles. I\ndon’t want to get him into trouble, but I don’t like to see you robbed,\nand so I tell you what I know. A FRIEND.\n\n\nMr. Redwood read this letter attentively, arching his brows, perhaps to\nindicate his surprise. Then he read it again carefully.\n\n“What do you think of it?” asked the merchant.\n\n“I don’t know,” answered Redwood slowly.\n\n“Have you ever seen anything suspicious in the conduct of young Ropes?”\n\n“I can’t say I have. On the contrary, he seems to be a very diligent and\nindustrious clerk.”\n\n“But about his honesty.”\n\n“I fancied him the soul of honesty.”\n\n“So did I, but of course we are liable to be deceived. It wouldn’t\nbe the first case where seeming honesty has been a cover for flagrant\ndishonesty.”\n\n“What do you wish me to do, Mr. Goodnow? Shall I send Ropes down to\nyou?”\n\n“No; it would only give him a chance, if guilty, to cover up his\ndishonesty.”\n\n“I am ready to follow your instructions.”\n\n“Do you know where he lodges?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Then I will ask you to go around there, and by some means gain\nadmission to his room. If he has any of our goods secreted take\npossession of them and report to me.”\n\n“Very well, sir.” Half an hour later Mrs. McCarty, Rodney’s landlady, in\nresponse to a ring admitted Mr. James Redwood.\n\n“Does a young man named Ropes lodge here?” he asked.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“I come from the house where he is employed. He has inadvertently left\nin his room a parcel belonging to us, and I should be glad if you would\nallow me to go up to his room and take it.”\n\n“You see, sir,” said Mrs. McCarty in a tone of hesitation, “while you\nlook like a perfect gentleman, I don’t know you, and I am not sure\nwhether, in justice to Mr. Ropes, I ought to admit you to his room.”\n\n“You are quite right my good lady; I am sure. It is just what I should\nwish my own landlady to do. I will therefore ask you to go up to the\nroom with me to see that all is right.”\n\n“That seems all right, sir. In that case I don’t object. Follow me, if\nyou please.”\n\nAs they entered Rodney’s room Mr. Redwood looked about him\ninquisitively. One article at once fixed his attention. It was a parcel\nwrapped in brown paper lying on the bed.\n\n“This is the parcel, I think,” he said. “If you will allow me I will\nopen it, to make sure.”\n\nMrs. McCarty looked undecided, but as she said nothing in opposition Mr.\nRedwood unfastened the strings and unrolled the bundle. His eyes lighted\nup with satisfaction as he disclosed the contents--a lady’s cloak.\n\nMrs. McCarty looked surprised.\n\n“Why, it’s a lady’s cloak,” she said, “and a very handsome one. What\nwould Mr. Ropes want of such a thing as that?”\n\n“Perhaps he intended to make you a present of it.”\n\n“No, he can’t afford to make such present.”\n\n“The explanation is simple. It belongs to the store. Perhaps Mr. Ropes\nleft it here inadvertently.”\n\n“But he hasn’t been here since morning.”\n\n“He has a pass key to the front door?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Then he may have been here. Would you object to my taking it?”\n\n“Yes, sir, you see I don’t know you.”\n\n“Your objection is a proper one. Then I will trouble you to take a look\nat the cloak, so that you would know it again.”\n\n“Certainly, sir. I shall remember it!”\n\n“That is all, Mrs. ----?”\n\n“McCarty, sir.”\n\n“Mrs. McCarty, I won’t take up any more of your time,” and Mr. Redwood\nstarted to go down stairs.\n\n“Who shall I tell Mr. Ropes called to see him.”\n\n“You needn’t say. I will mention the matter to him myself. I am employed\nin the same store.”\n\n“All right sir. Where is the store? I never thought to ask Mr. Ropes.”\n\n“Reade Street, near Broadway. You know where Reade Street is?”\n\n“Yes, sir. My husband used to work in Chambers Street. That is the first\nstreet south.”\n\n“Precisely. Well, I can’t stay longer, so I will leave, apologizing for\nhaving taken up so much of your time.”\n\n“Oh, it’s of no consequence, sir.”\n\n“He is a perfect gentleman,” she said to herself, as Mr. Redwood closed\nthe front door, and went out on the street. “I wonder whether he’s a\nwidower.”\n\nBeing a widow this was quite a natural thought for Mrs. McCarty to\nindulge in, particularly as Mr. Redwood looked to be a substantial man\nwith a snug income.\n\nMr. Redwood went back to the store, and went at once to the office.\n\n“Well, Redwood,” said Mr. Goodnow, “did you learn anything?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Go on.”\n\n“I went to the lodging of young Ropes, and was admitted to his room.”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“And there, wrapped in a brown paper, I found one of our missing cloaks\nlying on his bed.”\n\n“Is it possible?”\n\n“I am afraid he is not what we supposed him to be, Mr. Goodnow.”\n\n“It looks like it. I am surprised and sorry. Do you think he took the\nother articles that are missing?”\n\n“Of course I can’t say, sir, but it is fair to presume that he did.”\n\n“I am exceedingly sorry. I don’t mind saying, Redwood, that I took an\nespecial interest in that boy. I have already told you the circumstances\nof my meeting him, and the fancy taken to him by my friend Mulgrave.”\n\n“Yes, sir, I have heard you say that.”\n\n“I don’t think I am easily taken in, and that boy impressed me as\nthoroughly honest. But of course I don’t pretend to be infallible and it\nappears that I have been mistaken in him.”\n\nThe merchant looked troubled, for he had come to feel a sincere regard\nfor Rodney. He confessed to himself that he would rather have found any\nof the other clerks dishonest.\n\n“You may send Ropes to me,” he said, “Mr. Redwood, and you will please\ncome with him. We will investigate this matter at once.”\n\n“Very well, sir.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\nCHARGED WITH THEFT.\n\n\nRodney entered Mr. Goodnow’s office without a suspicion of the serious\naccusation which had been made against him. The first hint that there\nwas anything wrong came to him when he saw the stern look in the\nmerchants eyes.\n\n“Perhaps,” said Mr. Goodnow, as he leaned back in his chair and fixed\nhis gaze on the young clerk, “you may have an idea why I have sent for\nyou.”\n\n“No, sir,” answered Rodney, looking puzzled.\n\n“You can’t think of any reason I may have for wishing to see you?”\n\n“No, sir,” and Rodney returned Mr. Goodnow’s gaze with honest\nunfaltering eyes.\n\n“Possibly you are not aware that within a few weeks some articles have\nbeen missed from our stock.”\n\n“I have not heard of it. What kind of articles?”\n\n“The boy is more artful than I thought!” soliloquized the merchant.\n\n“All the articles missed,” he proceeded, “have been from the room\nin charge of Mr. Redwood, the room in which you, among others, are\nemployed.”\n\nSomething in Mr. Goodnow’s tone gave Rodney the hint of the truth. If he\nhad been guilty he would have flushed and showed signs of confusion.\nAs it was, he only wished to learn the truth and he in turn became the\nquestioner.\n\n“Is it supposed,” he asked, “that any one in your employ is responsible\nfor these thefts?”\n\n“It is.”\n\n“Is any one in particular suspected?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Will you tell me who, that is if you think I ought to know?”\n\n“Certainly you ought to know, for it is you who are suspected.”\n\nThen Rodney became indignant.\n\n“I can only deny the charge in the most emphatic terms,” he said. “If\nany one has brought such a charge against me, it is a lie.”\n\n“You can say that to Mr. Redwood, for it is he who accuses you.”\n\n“What does this mean, Mr. Redwood?” demanded Rodney quickly. “What have\nyou seen in me that leads you to accuse me of theft.”\n\n“To tell the truth, Ropes, you are about the last clerk in my room\nwhom I would have suspected. But early this morning this letter was\nreceived,” and he placed in Rodney’s hands the letter given in a\npreceding chapter.\n\nRodney read it through and handed it back scornfully.\n\n“I should like to see the person who wrote this letter,” he said. “It is\na base lie from beginning to end.”\n\n“I thought it might be when Mr. Goodnow showed it to me,” said Redwood\nin an even tone, “but Mr. Goodnow and I agreed that it would be well to\ninvestigate. Therefore I went to your room.”\n\n“When, sir?”\n\n“This morning.”\n\n“Then it is all right, for I am sure you found nothing.”\n\n“On the contrary, Ropes, I found that the statement made in the letter\nwas true. On your bed was a bundle containing one of the cloaks taken\nfrom our stock.”\n\nRodney’s face was the picture of amazement.\n\n“Is this true?” he said.\n\n“It certainly is. I hope you don’t doubt my word.”\n\n“Did you bring it back with you?”\n\n“No; your worthy landlady was not quite sure whether I was what I\nrepresented, and I left the parcel there. However I opened it in her\npresence so that she can testify what I found.”\n\n“This is very strange,” said Rodney, looking at his accuser with puzzled\neyes. “I know nothing whatever of the cloak and can’t imagine how it got\ninto my room.”\n\n“Perhaps it walked there,” said Mr. Goodnow satirically.\n\nRodney colored, for he understood that his employer did not believe him.\n\n“May I go to my room,” he asked, “and bring back the bundle with me?”\n\nObserving that Mr. Goodnow hesitated he added, “You can send Some one\nwith me to see that I don’t spirit away the parcel, and come back with\nit.”\n\n“On these conditions you may go. Redwood, send some one with Ropes.”\n\nRodney followed the chief of his department back to the cloak room, and\nthe latter, after a moments thought, summoned Jasper.\n\n“Jasper,” he said, “Ropes is going to his room to get a parcel which\nbelongs to the store. You may go with him.”\n\nThere was a flash of satisfaction in Jasper’s eyes as he answered with\nseeming indifference, “All right! I will go. I shall be glad to have a\nwalk.”\n\nAs the two boys passed out of the store, Jasper asked, “What does it\nmean, Ropes?”\n\n“I don’t know myself. I only know that there is said to be a parcel\ncontaining a cloak in my room. This cloak came from the store, and I am\nsuspected of having stolen it.”\n\n“Whew! that’s a serious matter. Of course it is all a mistake?”\n\n“Yes, it is all a mistake.”\n\n“But how could it get to your room unless you carried it there?”\n\nRodney gave Jasper a sharp look.\n\n“Some one must have taken it there,” he said.\n\n“How on earth did Uncle James find out?”\n\n“An anonymous letter was sent to Mr. Goodnow charging me with theft. Did\nyou hear that articles have been missed for some time from the stock?”\n\n“Never heard a word of it,” said Jasper with ready falsehood.\n\n“It seems the articles are missing from our room, and some one in the\nroom is suspected of being the thief.”\n\n“Good gracious! I hope no one will suspect me,” said Jasper in pretended\nalarm.\n\n“It seems I am suspected. I hope no other innocent person will have a\nlike misfortune.”\n\nPresently they reached Rodney’s lodgings. Mrs. McCarty was coming up the\nbasement stairs as they entered.\n\n“La, Mr. Ropes!” she said, “what brings you here in the middle of the\nday?”\n\n“I hear there is a parcel in my room.”\n\n“Yes; it contains such a lovely cloak. The gentleman from your store who\ncalled a little while ago thought you might have meant it as a present\nfor me.”\n\n“I am afraid it will be some time before I can afford to make such\npresent. Do you know if any one called and left the cloak here?”\n\n“No; I didn’t let in no one at the door.”\n\n“Was the parcel there when you made the bed?”\n\n“Well, no, it wasn’t. That is curious.”\n\n“It shows that the parcel has been left here since. Now I certainly\ncouldn’t have left it, for I have been at work all the morning. Come up\nstairs, Jasper.”\n\nThe two boys went up the stairs, and, entering Rodney’s room, found the\nparcel, still on the bed.\n\nRodney opened it and identified the cloak as exactly like those which\nthey carried in stock.\n\nHe examined the paper in which it was inclosed, but it seemed to differ\nfrom the wrapping paper used at the store. He called Jasper’s attention\nto this.\n\n“I have nothing to say,” remarked Jasper, shrugging his shoulders. “I\ndon’t understand the matter at all. I suppose you are expected to carry\nthe cloak back to the store.”\n\n“Yes, that is the only thing to do.”\n\n“I say, Ropes, it looks pretty bad for you.”\n\nJasper said this, but Rodney observed that his words were not\naccompanied by any expressions of sympathy, or any words that indicated\nhis disbelief of Rodney’s guilt.\n\n“Do you think I took this cloak from the store?” he demanded, facing\nround upon Jasper.\n\n“Really, I don’t know. It looks bad, finding it in your room.”\n\n“I needn’t ask any further. I can see what you think.”\n\n“You wouldn’t have me tell a lie, would you, Ropes? Of course such\nthings have been done before, and your salary is small.”\n\n“You insult me by your words,” said Rodney, flaming up.\n\n“Then I had better not speak, but you asked me, you know.”\n\n“Yes, I did. Things may look against me, but I am absolutely innocent.”\n\n“If you can make Mr. Goodnow think so,” said Jasper with provoking\ncoolness, “it will be all right. Perhaps he will forgive you.”\n\n“I don’t want his forgiveness. I want him to think me honest.”\n\n“Well, I hope you are, I am sure, but it won’t do any good our\ndiscussing it, and it doesn’t make any difference what I think any way.”\n\nBy this time they had reached the store.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\nRODNEY IS DISCHARGED.\n\n\nRodney reported his return to Mr. Redwood, and in his company went down\nstairs to the office, with the package under his arm.\n\n“Well?” said Mr. Goodnow inquiringly.\n\n“This is the package, sir.”\n\n“And it was found in your room?”\n\n“Yes, sir, I found it on my bed.”\n\n“Can’t you account for it being there?” asked the merchant searchingly.\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“You must admit that its presence in your room looks bad for you.”\n\n“I admit it sir; but I had nothing to do with it being there.”\n\n“Have you any theory to account for it?”\n\n“Only this, that some one must have carried it to my room and placed it\nwhere it was found.”\n\n“Did you question your landlady as to whether she had admitted any one\nduring the morning?”\n\n“Yes, sir. She had not.”\n\n“This is very unfavorable to you.”\n\n“In what way, sir?”\n\n“It makes it probable that you carried in the parcel yourself.”\n\n“That I deny,” said Rodney boldly.\n\n“I expected you to deny it,” said the merchant coldly. “If this cloak\nwere the only one that had been taken I would drop the matter. But\nthis is by no means the case. Mr. Redwood, can you give any idea of the\nextent to which we have been robbed?”\n\n“So far as I can estimate we have lost a dozen cloaks and about half a\ndozen dress patterns.”\n\n“This is a serious loss, Ropes,” said Mr. Goodnow. “I should think it\nwould foot up several hundred dollars. If you can throw any light upon\nthe thefts, or give me information by which I can get back the goods\neven at considerable expense, I will be as considerate with you as I\ncan.”\n\n“Mr. Goodnow,” returned Rodney hotly, “I know no more about the matter\nthan you do. I hope you will investigate, and if you can prove that I\ntook any of the missing articles I want no consideration. I shall expect\nyou to have me arrested, and, if convicted, punished.”\n\n“These are brave words, Ropes,” said Mr. Goodnow coldly, “but they are\nonly words. The parcel found in your room affords strong ground for\nsuspicion that you are responsible for at least a part of the thefts.\nUnder the circumstances there is only one thing for me to do, and that\nis to discharge you.”\n\n“Very well, sir.”\n\n“You may go to the cashier and he will pay you to the end of the week,\nbut your connection with the store will end at once.”\n\n“I don’t care to be paid to the end of the week, sir. If you will give\nme an order for payment up to tonight, that will be sufficient.”\n\n“It shall be as you say.”\n\nMr. Goodnow wrote a few words on a slip of paper and handed it to\nRodney.\n\n“I will leave my address, sir, and if I change it I will notify you. If\nyou should hear anything as to the real robber I will ask you as a favor\nto communicate with me.”\n\n“Mr. Redwood, you have heard the request of Ropes, I will look to you to\ncomply with it.”\n\n“Very well, sir.”\n\nThe merchant turned back to his letters, and Rodney left the office,\nwith what feelings of sorrow and humiliation may be imagined.\n\n“I am sorry for this occurrence, Ropes,” said Mr. Redwood, with a touch\nof sympathy in his voice.\n\n“Do you believe me guilty, Mr. Redwood?”\n\n“I cannot do otherwise. I hope you are innocent, and, if so, that the\nreally guilty party will be discovered sooner or later.”\n\n“Thank you, sir.”\n\nWhen they entered the room in which Rodney had been employed Jasper came\nup, his face alive with curiosity.\n\n“Well,” he said, “how did you come out?”\n\n“I am discharged,” said Rodney bitterly.\n\n“Well, you couldn’t complain of that. Things looked pretty dark for\nyou.”\n\n“If I had committed the theft, I would not complain. Indeed, I would\nsubmit to punishment without a murmur. But it is hard to suffer while\ninnocent.”\n\n“Uncle James,” said Jasper, “if Ropes is going will you ask Mr. Goodnow\nto put me in his place?”\n\nEven Mr. Redwood was disgusted by this untimely request.\n\n“It would be more becoming,” he said sharply, “if you would wait till\nRopes was fairly out of the store before applying for his position.”\n\n“I want to be in time. I don’t want any one to get ahead of me.”\n\nJames Redwood did not deign a reply.\n\n“I am sorry you leave us under such circumstances, Ropes,” he said. “The\ntime may come when you will be able to establish your innocence, and in\nthat case Mr. Goodnow will probably take you back again.”\n\nRodney did not answer, but with his order went to the cashier’s desk and\nreceived the four dollars due him. Then, with a heavy heart, he left the\nstore where it had been such a satisfaction to him to work.\n\nOn Broadway he met his room mate, Mike Flynn, in the uniform of a\ntelegraph boy.\n\n“Where are you goin’, Rodney?” asked Mike. “You ain’t let off so early,\nare you?”\n\n“I am let off for good and all, Mike.”\n\n“What’s that?”\n\n“I am discharged.”\n\n“What for?” asked Mike in amazement.\n\n“I will tell you when you get home tonight.”\n\nRodney went back to his room, and lay down sad and despondent. Some\nhours later Mike came in, and was told the story. The warm hearted\ntelegraph boy was very angry.\n\n“That boss of yours must be a stupid donkey,” he said.\n\n“I don’t know. The parcel was found in my room.”\n\n“Anybody’d know to look at you that you wouldn’t steal.”\n\n“Some thieves look very innocent. The only way to clear me is to find\nout who left the bundle at the house.”\n\n“Doesn’t Mrs. McCarty know anything about it?”\n\n“No; I asked her.”\n\n“Some one might have got into the house without her knowing anything\nabout it. The lock is a very common one. There are plenty of keys that\nwill open it.”\n\n“If we could find some one that saw a person with a bundle go up the\nsteps, that would give us a clew.”\n\n“That’s so. We’ll ask.”\n\nBut for several days no one could be found who had seen any such person.\n\nMeanwhile Rodney was at a loss what to do. He was cut off from applying\nfor another place, for no one would engage him if he were refused\na recommendation from his late employer. Yet he must obtain some\nemployment for he could not live on nothing.\n\n“Do you think, Mike,” he asked doubtfully, “that I could make anything\nselling papers?”\n\n“Such business isn’t for you,” answered the telegraph boy.\n\n“But it is one of the few things open to me. I can become a newsboy\nwithout recommendations. Even your business would be closed to me if it\nwere known that I was suspected of theft.”\n\n“Thats so,” said Mike, scratching his head in perplexity.\n\n“Then would you recommend my becoming a newsboy?”\n\n“I don’t know. You couldn’t make more’n fifty or sixty cent a day.”\n\n“That will be better than nothing.”\n\n“And I can pay the rent, or most of it, as I’ll be doin’ better than\nyou.”\n\n“We will wait and see how much I make.”\n\nSo Rodney swallowed his pride, and procuring a supply of afternoon\npapers set about selling them. He knew that it was an honest business,\nand there was no disgrace in following it.\n\nBut one day he was subjected to keen mortification. Jasper Redwood and\na friend--it was Philip Carton, his confederate--were walking along\nBroadway, and their glances fell on Rodney.\n\n“I say, Jasper,” said the elder of the two, “isn’t that the boy who was\nin the same store with you?”\n\nJasper looked, and his eyes lighted up with malicious satisfaction.\n\n“Oho!” he said. “Well, this is rich!”\n\n“Give me a paper, boy,” he said, pretending not to recognize Rodney at\nfirst. “Why, it’s Ropes.”\n\n“Yes,” answered Rodney, his cheek flushing. “You see what I am reduced\nto. What paper will you buy?”\n\n“The Mail and Express.”\n\n“Here it is.”\n\n“Can’t you get another place?” asked Jasper curiously.\n\n“I might if I could get a recommendation, but probably Mr. Goodnow\nwouldn’t give me one.”\n\n“No, I guess not.”\n\n“So I must take what I can get.”\n\n“Do you make much selling papers?”\n\n“Very little.”\n\n“You can’t make as much as you did in the store?”\n\n“Not much more than half as much.”\n\n“Do you live in the same place?”\n\n“Yes, for the present.”\n\n“Oh, by the way, Ropes, I’ve got your old place,” said Jasper in\nexultation.\n\n“I thought you would get it,” answered Rodney, not without a pang.\n\n“Come into the store some day, Ropes. It will seem like old times.”\n\n“I shall not enter the store till I am able to clear myself of the\ncharge made against me.”\n\n“Then probably you will stay away a long time.”\n\n“I am afraid so.”\n\n“Well, ta, ta! Come along, Philip.”\n\nAs Rodney followed with his eye the figure of his complacent successor\nhe felt that his fate was indeed a hard one.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\nA RICH FIND.\n\n\nAs Jasper and his companion moved away, Carton said, “I’m sorry for that\npoor duffer, Jasper.”\n\n“Why should you be sorry?” asked Jasper, frowning.\n\n“Because he has lost a good place and good prospects, and all for no\nfault of his own.”\n\n“You are getting sentimental, Philip,” sneered Jasper.\n\n“No, but I am showing a little humanity. He has lost all this through\nyou----”\n\n“Through us, you mean.”\n\n“Well, through us. We have made him the scapegoat for our sins.”\n\n“Oh well, he is making a living.”\n\n“A pretty poor one. I don’t think you would like to be reduced to\nselling papers.”\n\n“His case and mine are different.”\n\n“I begin to think also that we have made a mistake in getting him\ndischarged so soon.”\n\n“We can’t take anything more.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“Because there will be no one to lay the blame upon. He is out of the\nstore.”\n\n“That is true. I didn’t think of that. But I invited him to come around\nand call. If he should, and something else should be missing it would be\nlaid to him.”\n\n“I don’t believe he will call. I am terribly hard up, and our source of\nincome has failed us. Haven’t you got a dollar or two to spare?”\n\n“No,” answered Jasper coldly. “I only get seven dollars a week.”\n\n“But you have nearly all that. You only have to hand in two dollars a\nweek to your uncle.”\n\n“Look here, Philip Carton, I hope you don’t expect to live off me. I\nhave all I can do to take care of myself.”\n\nCarton looked at Jasper in anger and mortification.\n\n“I begin to understand how good a friend you are,” he said.\n\n“I am not fool enough to pinch myself to keep you,” said Jasper bluntly.\n“You are a man of twenty five and I am only a boy. You ought to be able\nto take care of yourself.”\n\n“Just give me a dollar, or lend it Jasper, and I will risk it at play.\nI may rise from the table with a hundred. If I do I will pay you\nhandsomely for the loan.”\n\n“I couldn’t do it, Mr. Carton. I have only two dollars in my pocket, and\nI have none to spare.”\n\n“Humph! what is that?”\n\nPhilip Carton’s eyes were fixed upon the sidewalk. There was a flimsy\npiece of paper fluttering about impelled by the wind. He stooped and\npicked it up.\n\n“It is a five dollar bill,” he exclaimed in exultation. “My luck has\ncome back.”\n\nJasper changed his tone at once. Now Philip was the better off of the\ntwo.\n\n“That is luck!” he said. “Shall we go into Delmonico’s, and have an\nice?”\n\n“If it is at your expense, yes.”\n\n“That wouldn’t be fair. You have more money than I.”\n\n“Yes, and I mean to keep it myself. You have set me the example.”\n\n“Come, Philip, you are not angry at my refusing you a loan?”\n\n“No; I think you were sensible. I shall follow your example. I will bid\nyou good night. I seem to be in luck, and will try my fortune at the\ngaming table.”\n\n“I will go with you.”\n\n“No; I would prefer to go alone.”\n\n“That fellow is unreasonable,” muttered Jasper, as he strode off,\ndiscontented. “Did he expect I would divide my salary with him?”\n\nPhilip Carton, after he parted company with Jasper, walked back to where\nRodney was still selling papers.\n\n“Give me a paper,” he said.\n\n“Which will you have?”\n\n“I am not particular. Give me the first that comes handy. Ah, the\nEvening Sun will do.”\n\nHe took the paper and put a quarter into Rodney’s hand.\n\nAs he was walking away Rodney called out, “Stop, here’s your change,”\n\n“Never mind,” said Philip with a wave of the hand.\n\n“Thank you,” said Rodney gratefully, for twenty five cents was no trifle\nto him at this time.\n\n“That ought to bring me luck,” soliloquized Philip Carton as he walked\non. “It isn’t often I do a good deed. It was all the money I had besides\nthe five dollar bill, and I am sure the news boy will make better use of\nit than I would.”\n\n“That was the young man that was walking with Jasper,” reflected Rodney.\n“Well, he is certainly a better fellow than he. Thanks to this quarter,\nI shall have made eighty cents today, and still have half a dozen\npapers. That is encouraging.”\n\nSeveral days passed that could not be considered lucky. Rodney’s average\nprofits were only about fifty cent a day, and that was barely sufficient\nto buy his meals. It left him nothing to put towards paying room rent.\n\nHe began to consider whether he would not be compelled to pawn some\narticle from his wardrobe, for he was well supplied with clothing, when\nhe had a stroke of luck.\n\nOn Fifteenth Street, by the side of Tiffany’s great jewelry store, he\npicked up a square box neatly done up in thin paper. Opening it, he was\ndazzled by the gleam of diamonds.\n\nThe contents were a diamond necklace and pin, which, even to Rodney’s\ninexperienced eyes, seemed to be of great value.\n\n“Some one must have dropped them in coming from the jewelry store,” he\nreflected. “Who can it be?”\n\nHe had not far to seek. There was a card inside on which was engraved:\n\n\nMRS. ELIZA HARVEY,\n\nwith an address on Fifth Avenue.\n\n\nPassing through to Fifth Avenue Rodney began to scan the numbers on\nthe nearest houses. He judged that Mrs. Harvey must live considerably\nfarther up the Avenue, in the direction of Central Park.\n\n“I will go there at once,” Rodney decided. “No doubt Mrs. Harvey is very\nmuch distressed by her loss. I shall carry her good news.”\n\nThe house he found to be between Fortieth and Fiftieth Street. Ascending\nthe steps he rang the bell. The door was opened by a man servant.\n\n“Does Mrs. Harvey live here?” asked Rodney.\n\n“What do you want with her, young man?” demanded the servant in a tone\nof importance.\n\n“That I will tell her.”\n\n“What’s your name?”\n\n“I can give you my name, but she won’t recognize it.”\n\n“Then you don’t know her.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“If it’s money you want, she don’t give to beggars.”\n\n“You are impudent,” said Rodney hotly. “If you don’t give my message you\nwill get into trouble.”\n\nThe servant opened his eyes. He seemed somewhat impressed by Rodney’s\nconfident tone.\n\n“Mrs. Harvey doesn’t live here,” he said.\n\n“Is she in the house?”\n\n“Well, yes, she’s visiting here.”\n\n“Then why do you waste your time?” said Rodney impatiently. He forgot\nfor the time that he was no longer being educated at an expensive\nboarding school, and spoke in the tone he would have used before his\ncircumstances had changed.\n\n“I’ll go and ask if she’ll see you,” said the flunky unwillingly.\n\nFive minutes later a pleasant looking woman of middle age descended the\nstaircase.\n\n“Are you the boy that wished to see me?” she asked.\n\n“Yes, if you are Mrs. Harvey.”\n\n“I am. But come in! Thomas, why didn’t you invite this young gentleman\ninto the parlor?”\n\nThomas opened his eyes wide. So the boy whom he had treated so\ncavalierly was a young gentleman.\n\nHe privately put down Mrs. Harvey in his own mind as eccentric.\n\n“Excuse me, ma’am,” he said. “I didn’t know as he was parlor company.”\n\n“Well, he is,” said Mrs. Harvey with a cordial smile that won Rodney’s\nheart.\n\n“Follow me!” said the lady.\n\nRodney followed her into a handsome apartment and at a signal seated\nhimself on a sofa.\n\n“Now,” she said, “I am ready to listen to your message.”\n\n“Have you lost anything?” asked Rodney abruptly.\n\n“Oh, have you found it?” exclaimed Mrs. Harvey, clasping her hands.\n\n“That depends on what you have lost,” answered Rodney, who felt that it\nwas necessary to be cautious.\n\n“Certainly, you are quite right. I have lost a box containing jewelry\nbought this morning at Tiffany’s.”\n\n“What were the articles?”\n\n“A diamond necklace and pin. They are intended as a present for my\ndaughter who is to be married. Tell me quick have you found them?”\n\n“Is this the box?” asked Rodney.\n\n“Oh yes, yes! How delightful to recover it. I thought I should never see\nit again. Where did you find it?”\n\n“On Fifteenth Street beside Tiffany’s store.”\n\n“And you brought it directly to me?”\n\n“Yes, madam.”\n\n“Have you any idea of the value of the articles?”\n\n“Perhaps they may be worth five hundred dollars.”\n\n“They are worth over a thousand. Are you poor?”\n\n“Yes, madam. I am trying to make a living by selling papers, but find it\nhard work.”\n\n“But you don’t look like a newsboy.”\n\n“Till a short time since I thought myself moderately rich.”\n\n“That is strange. Tell me your story.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nA SURPRISING TURN OF FORTUNE.\n\n\nRodney told his story frankly. Mrs. Harvey was very sympathetic by\nnature, and she listened with the deepest interest, and latterly with\nindignation when Rodney spoke of his dismissal from Mr. Goodnow’s store.\n\n“You have been treated shamefully,” she said warmly.\n\n“I think Mr. Goodnow really believes me guilty,” rejoined Rodney.\n\n“A dishonest boy would hardly have returned a valuable box of jewelry.”\n\n“Still Mr. Goodnow didn’t know that I would do it.”\n\n“I see you are disposed to apologize for your late employer.”\n\n“I do not forget that he treated me kindly till this last occurrence.”\n\n“Your consideration does you credit. So you have really been reduced to\nearn your living as a newsboy?”\n\n“Yes, madam.”\n\n“I must think what I can do for you. I might give you money, but when\nthat was gone you would be no better off.”\n\n“I would much rather have help in getting a place.”\n\nMrs. Harvey leaned her head on her hand and looked thoughtful.\n\n“You are right,” she said. “Let me think.”\n\nRodney waited, hoping that the lady would be able to think of something\nto his advantage.\n\nFinally she spoke.\n\n“I think you said you understood Latin and Greek?”\n\n“I have studied both languages and French also. I should have been ready\nto enter college next summer.”\n\n“Then perhaps I shall be able to do something for you. I live in\nPhiladelphia, but I have a brother living in West Fifty Eighth Street.\nHe has one little boy, Arthur, now nine years of age. Arthur is quite\nprecocious, but his health is delicate, and my brother has thought of\ngetting a private instructor for him. Do you like young children?”\n\n“Very much. I always wished that I had a little brother.”\n\n“Then I think you would suit my brother better as a tutor for Arthur\nthan a young man. Being a boy yourself, you would be not only tutor but\ncompanion.”\n\n“I should like such a position very much.”\n\n“Then wait here a moment, and I will write you a letter of\nintroduction.”\n\nShe went up stairs, but soon returned.\n\nShe put a small perfumed billet into Rodney’s hands. It was directed to\nJohn Sargent with an address on West Fifty Eighth Street.\n\n“Call this evening,” she said, “about half past seven o’clock. My\nbrother will be through dinner, and will not have gone out at that\nhour.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Rodney gratefully.\n\n“Here is another envelope which you can open at your leisure. I cannot\npart from you without thanking you once more for returning my jewelry.”\n\n“You have thanked me in a very practical way, Mrs. Harvey.”\n\n“I hope my letter may lead to pleasant results for you. If you ever come\nto Philadelphia call upon me at No. 1492 Walnut Street.”\n\n“Thank you.”\n\nAs Rodney left the house he felt that his ill fortune had turned,\nand that a new prospect was opened up before him. He stepped into the\nWindsor Hotel, and opened the envelope last given him. It contained five\nfive dollar bills.\n\nTo one of them was pinned a scrap of paper containing these words: “I\nhope this money will be useful to you. It is less than the reward I\nshould have offered for the recovery of the jewels.”\n\nUnder the circumstances Rodney felt that he need not scruple to use the\nmoney. He knew that he had rendered Mrs. Harvey a great service, and\nthat she could well afford to pay him the sum which the envelopes\ncontained.\n\nHe began to be sensible that he was hungry, not having eaten for some\ntime. He went into a restaurant on Sixth Avenue, and ordered a sirloin\nsteak. It was some time since he had indulged in anything beyond a\ncommon steak, and he greatly enjoyed the more luxurious meal. He\ndidn’t go back to selling papers, for he felt that it would hardly be\nconsistent with the position of a classical teacher--the post for which\nhe was about to apply.\n\nHalf past seven found him at the door of Mr. John Sargent. The house was\nof brown stone, high stoop, and four stories in height. It was such a\nhouse as only a rich man could occupy.\n\nHe was ushered into the parlor and presently Mr. Sargent came in from\nthe dining room.\n\n“Are you Mr. Ropes?” he asked, looking at Rodney’s card.\n\nIt is not usual for newsboys to carry cards, but Rodney had some left\nover from his more prosperous days.\n\n“Yes, sir. I bring you a note of introduction from Mrs. Harvey.”\n\n“Ah yes, my sister. Let me see it.”\n\nThe note was of some length. That is, it covered three pages of note\npaper. Mr. Sargent read it attentively.\n\n“My sister recommends you as tutor for my little son, Arthur,” he said,\nas he folded up the letter.\n\n“Yes, sir; she suggested that I might perhaps suit you in that\ncapacity.”\n\n“She also says that you found and restored to her a valuable box of\njewelry which she was careless enough to drop near Tiffany’s.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“I have a good deal of confidence in my sister’s good judgment. She\nevidently regards you very favorably.”\n\n“I am glad of that sir,”\n\n“Will you tell me something of your qualifications? Arthur is about to\ncommence Latin. He is not old enough for Greek.”\n\n“I could teach either, sir.”\n\n“And of course you are well up in English branches?”\n\n“I think I am.”\n\n“My sister hints that you are poor, and obliged to earn your own living.\nHow, then, have you been able to secure so good an education?”\n\n“I have only been poor for a short time. My father left me fifty\nthousand dollars, but it was lost by my guardian.”\n\n“Who was your guardian?”\n\n“Mr. Benjamin Fielding.”\n\n“I knew him well. I don’t think he was an unprincipled man, but he was\ncertainly imprudent, and was led into acts that were reprehensible. Did\nhe lose all your money for you?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“What did you do?”\n\n“Left the boarding school where I was being educated, and came to this\ncity.”\n\n“Did you obtain any employment?”\n\n“Yes, sir; I have been employed for a short time by Otis Goodnow, a\nmerchant of Reade Street.”\n\n“And why did you leave?”\n\n“Because Mr. Goodnow missed some articles from his stock, and I was\ncharged with taking them.”\n\nRodney was fearful of the effect of his frank confession upon Mr.\nSargent, but the latter soon reassured him.\n\n“Your honesty in restoring my sister’s jewelry is sufficient proof that\nthe charge was unfounded. I shall not let it influence me.”\n\n“Thank you, sir.”\n\n“Now as to the position of teacher, though very young, I don’t see why\nyou should not fill it satisfactorily. I will call Arthur.”\n\nHe went to the door and called “Arthur.”\n\nA delicate looking boy with a sweet, intelligent face, came running into\nthe room.\n\n“Do you want me, papa?”\n\n“Yes, Arthur. I have a new friend for you. Will you shake hands with\nhim?”\n\nArthur, who was not a shy boy, went up at once to Rodney and offered his\nhand.\n\n“I am glad to see you,” he said.\n\nRodney smiled. He was quite taken with the young boy.\n\n“What’s your name?” the latter asked.\n\n“Rodney Ropes.”\n\n“Are you going to stay and make us a visit?”\n\nMr. Sargent answered this question.\n\n“Would you like to have Rodney stay?” he asked.\n\n“Oh yes.”\n\n“How would you like to have him give you lessons in Latin and other\nstudies?”\n\n“I should like it. I am sure he wouldn’t be cross. Are you a teacher,\nRodney?”\n\n“I will be your teacher if you are willing to have me.”\n\n“Yes, I should like it. And will you go to walk with me in Central\nPark?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then, papa, you may as well engage him. I was afraid you would get a\ntiresome old man for my teacher.”\n\n“That settles it, Rodney,” said Mr. Sargent, smiling. “Now, Arthur, run\nout and I will speak further with Rodney about you.”\n\n“All right, papa.”\n\n“As Arthur seems to like you, I will give you a trial. As he suggested,\nI should like to have you become his companion as well as teacher.\nYou will come here at nine o’clock in the morning, and stay till four,\ntaking lunch with your pupil. About the compensation, will you tell me\nwhat will be satisfactory to you?”\n\n“I prefer to leave that to you, sir.”\n\n“Then we will say fifteen dollars a week--today is Thursday. Will you\npresent yourself here next Monday morning?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“If you would like an advance of salary, you need only say so.”\n\n“Thank you, sir, but I am fairly provided with money for the present.”\n\n“Then nothing more need be said. As I am to meet a gentleman at the\nUnion League Club tonight, I will bid you good evening, and expect to\nsee you on Monday.”\n\nRodney rose and Mr. Sargent accompanied him to the door, shaking hands\nwith him courteously by way of farewell.\n\nRodney emerged into the street in a state of joyous excitement. Twenty\nfive dollars in his pocket, and fifteen dollars a week! He could hardly\ncredit his good fortune.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\nJASPER’S PERPLEXITY.\n\n\nMike Flynn was overjoyed to hear of Rodney’s good fortune.\n\n“Fifteen dollars a week!” he repeated. “Why you will be rich.”\n\n“Not exactly that, Mike, but it will make me comfortable. By the way,\nas I have so much more than you, it will only be fair for me to pay the\nwhole rent.”\n\n“No, Rodney, you mustn’t do that.”\n\n“I shall insist upon it, Mike. You would do the same in my place.”\n\n“Yes I would.”\n\n“So you can’t object to my doing it.”\n\n“You are very kind to me, Rodney,” said Mike, who had the warm heart of\nhis race. “It isn’t every boy brought up like you who would be willing\nto room with a bootblack.”\n\n“But you are not a bootblack now. You are a telegraph boy.”\n\n“There are plenty that mind me when I blacked boots down in front of the\nAstor House.”\n\n“You are just as good a boy for all that. How much did you make last\nweek?”\n\n“Four dollars salary, and a dollar and a half in extra tips.”\n\n“Hereafter you must save your rent money for clothes. We must have you\nlooking respectable.”\n\n“Won’t you adopt me, Rodney?” asked Mike with a laughing face.\n\n“That’s a good idea. Perhaps I will. In that case you must obey all\nmy orders. In the first place, what are you most in want in the way of\nclothing?”\n\n“I haven’t got but two shirts.”\n\n“That is hardly enough for a gentleman of your social position. Anything\nelse.”\n\n“I’m short on collars and socks.”\n\n“Then we’ll go out shopping. I’ll buy you a supply of each.”\n\n“But you haven’t begun to work yet.”\n\n“No, but Mrs. Harvey made me a present of twenty five dollars. We’ll go\nto some of the big stores on Sixth Avenue where we can get furnishing\ngoods cheap.”\n\nRodney carried out his purpose, and at the cost of four dollars supplied\nhis room mate with all he needed for the present.\n\n“See what it is to be rich, Mike,” he said. “It seems odd for me to be\nbuying clothes for my adopted son.”\n\n“You’re in luck, Rodney, and so am I. I hope some time I can do you a\nfavor.”\n\n“Perhaps you can, Mike. If I should get sick, you might take my place as\ntutor.”\n\n“You must know an awful lot, Rodney,” said Mike, regarding his companion\nwith new respect.\n\n“Thank you for the compliment, Mike. I hope Mr. Sargent will have the\nsame opinion.”\n\nThe next day it is needless to say that Rodney did not resume the\nbusiness of newsboy. He was very glad to give it up. He dressed with\nunusual care and took a walk down town.\n\nAs he passed Reade Street by chance Jasper was coming around the\ncorner. His face lighted up first with pleasure at seeing Rodney, for\nit gratified his mean nature to triumph over the boy whom he had ousted\nfrom his position, and next with surprise at his unusually neat and\nwell dressed appearance. Rodney looked far from needing help. He might\nreadily have been taken for a boy of aristocratic lineage.\n\n“Hallo!” said Jasper, surveying Rodney curiously.\n\n“How are you this morning, Jasper?” returned Rodney quietly.\n\n“Why ain’t you selling papers?”\n\n“I don’t like the business.”\n\n“But you’ve got to make a living.”\n\n“Quite true.”\n\n“Are you going to black boots?”\n\n“Why should I? Is it a desirable business?”\n\n“How should I know?” asked Jasper, coloring.\n\n“I didn’t know but you might have had some experience at it. I haven’t.”\n\n“Do you mean to insult me?” demanded Jasper hotly.\n\n“I never insult anybody. I will only say that you are as likely to take\nup the business as I.”\n\n“I’ve got a place.”\n\n“How do you know but I have?”\n\n“Because you were selling papers yesterday and are walking the street\ntoday.”\n\n“That is true. But I have a place engaged for all that. I shall go to\nwork on Monday.”\n\nJasper pricked up his ears.\n\n“Where is it?” he asked.\n\n“I don’t care to tell at present.”\n\n“Is it true? Have you got a place?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I don’t see how you could. Mr. Goodnow wouldn’t give you a\nrecommendation.”\n\n“There is no reason why he should not.”\n\n“What, after your taking cloaks and dress patterns from the store?”\n\n“I did nothing of the kind. Sooner or later Mr. Goodnow will find out\nhis mistake. Probably the real thief is still in his employ.”\n\nJasper turned pale and regarded Rodney searchingly, but there was\nnothing in his manner or expression to indicate that his remark had been\npersonal. He thought it best to turn the conversation.\n\n“How much pay do you get--four dollars?”\n\n“More than that.”\n\n“You don’t get as much as you did at our store?”\n\n“Yes; I get more.”\n\nNow it was Jasper’s turn to show surprise. He did not know whether\nto believe Rodney or not, but there was something in his face which\ncommanded belief.\n\n“How much do you get?” he asked.\n\n“You would not believe me if I told you.”\n\n“Try me,” returned Jasper, whose curiosity was aroused.\n\n“I am to get fifteen dollars a week.”\n\nJasper would not have looked more surprised if Rodney had informed him\nthat he was to become a Cabinet minister.\n\n“You’re joking!” he ejaculated.\n\n“Not at all.”\n\n“How could you have the face to ask such a price. Did you pass yourself\noff as an experienced salesman?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I don’t understand it at all, that is, if you are telling the truth.”\n\n“I have told you the truth, Jasper. I have no object in deceiving you.\nThe salary was fixed by my employer.”\n\n“Who did you say it was?”\n\n“I didn’t say.”\n\nJasper’s cunning scheme was defeated. He felt disturbed to hear of\nRodney’s good fortune, but he had a shot in reserve.\n\n“I don’t think you will keep your place long,” he said in a malicious\ntone.\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“Your employer will hear under what circumstances you left our store,\nand then of course he will discharge you.”\n\n“You will be sorry for that won’t you?” asked Rodney pointedly.\n\n“Why of course I don’t want you to have bad luck.”\n\n“Thank you. You are very considerate.”\n\n“Suppose you lose your place, shall you go back to selling papers?”\n\n“I hope to find something better to do.”\n\n“Where are you going now?”\n\n“To get some lunch.”\n\n“So am I. Suppose we go together.”\n\n“Very well, providing you will lunch with me.”\n\n“I don’t want to impose upon you.”\n\n“You won’t. We may not meet again for some time, and we shall have this\nmeal to remind us of each other.”\n\nThey went to a well known restaurant on Park Row. Rodney ordered a\nliberal dinner for himself, and Jasper followed his example nothing\nloath. He was always ready to dine at the expense of others, but even as\nhe ate he could not help wondering at the strange chance that had made\nhim the guest of a boy who was selling papers the day before.\n\nHe had nearly finished eating when a disturbing thought occurred to him.\nSuppose Rodney didn’t have money enough to settle the bill, and threw it\nupon him.\n\nWhen Rodney took the checks and walked up to the cashier’s desk he\nfollowed him with some anxiety. But his companion quietly took out a\nfive dollar bill, from his pocket and tendered it to the cashier. The\nlatter gave him back the right change and the two boys went out into the\nstreet.\n\n“You seem to have plenty of money,” said Jasper.\n\n“There are very few who would admit having that,” smiled Rodney.\n\n“I don’t see why you sold papers if you have five dollar bills in your\npocket.”\n\n“I don’t want to be idle.”\n\n“May I tell my uncle and Mr. Goodnow that you have got a place?”\n\n“If you like.”\n\n“Well, good by, I must be hurrying back to the store.”\n\nRodney smiled. He rather enjoyed Jasper’s surprise and perplexity.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\nRODNEY’S SECRET IS DISCOVERED.\n\n\nJasper lost no time in acquainting his uncle with Rodney’s extraordinary\ngood fortune. James Redwood was surprised, but not all together\nincredulous.\n\n“I don’t understand it,” he said, “but Ropes appears to be a boy of\ntruth. Perhaps he may have exaggerated the amount of his salary.”\n\n“I hardly think so, uncle. He gave me a tip top dinner down on Park\nRow.”\n\n“He may have been in funds from selling the articles taken from the\nstore.”\n\n“That’s so!” assented Jasper, who had the best possible reason for\nknowing that it was not so.\n\n“I wish the boy well,” said his uncle. “He always treated me\nrespectfully, and I never had anything against him except the loss of\nstock, and it is not certain that he is the thief.”\n\n“I guess there isn’t any doubt about that.”\n\n“Yet, believing him to be a thief, you did not hesitate to accept a\ndinner from him.”\n\n“I didn’t want to hurt his feelings,” replied Jasper, rather sheepishly.\n\n“Do you know what sort of a place he has got, or with what house?”\n\n“No; he wouldn’t tell me.”\n\n“He thought perhaps you would inform the new firm of the circumstances\nunder which he left us. I don’t blame him, but I am surprised that he\nshould have been engaged without a recommendation.”\n\n“Shall you tell Mr. Goodnow?”\n\n“Not unless he asks about Ropes. I don’t want to interfere with the boy\nin any way.”\n\nIn the store, as has already been stated, Jasper succeeded to Rodney’s\nplace, and in consequence his pay was raised to seven dollars a week.\nStill it was not equal to what it had been when he was receiving\nadditional money from the sale of the articles stolen by Philip Carton\nand himself.\n\nThe way in which they had operated was this: Philip would come in and\nbuy a cloak or a dress pattern from Jasper, and the young salesman would\npack up two or three instead of one. There was a drawback to the profit\nin those cases, as Carton would be obliged to sell both at a reduced\nprice. Still they had made a considerable sum from these transactions,\nthough not nearly as much as Mr. Goodnow had lost.\n\nAfter the discovery of the theft and the discharge of Rodney, the two\nconfederates felt that it would be imprudent to do any more in that\nline. This suspension entailed heavier loss on Carton than on Jasper.\nThe latter had a fixed income and a home at his uncle’s house, while\nPhilip had no regular income, though he occasionally secured a little\ntemporary employment.\n\nIn the meantime Rodney had commenced his tutorship. His young pupil\nbecame very fond of him, and being a studious boy, made rapid progress\nin his lessons.\n\nMr. Sargent felt that his experiment, rash as it might be considered,\nvindicated his wisdom by its success. At the end of a month he\nvoluntarily raised Rodney’s salary to twenty dollars a week.\n\n“I am afraid you are overpaying me, Mr. Sargent,” said Rodney.\n\n“That’s my lookout. Good service is worth a good salary, and I am\nperfectly satisfied with you.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. I prize that even more than the higher salary.”\n\nOnly a portion of Rodney’s time was spent in teaching. In the afternoon\nhe and his charge went on little excursions, generally to Central Park.\n\nOne holiday, about four months after the commencement of Rodney’s\nengagement, he was walking in the Park when he fell in with Jasper.\nJasper’s attention was at once drawn to the little boy, whose dress and\ngeneral appearance indicated that he belonged to a wealthy family. This\nexcited Jasper’s curiosity.\n\n“How are you, Rodney?” said Jasper adroitly. “It is a good while since I\nmet you.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Who is the little boy with you?”\n\n“His name is Arthur Sargent.”\n\nRodney gave this information unwillingly, for he saw that his secret was\nlikely to be discovered.\n\n“How do you do, Arthur?” asked Jasper, with unwonted affability, for he\ndid not care for children.\n\n“Pretty well,” answered Arthur politely.\n\n“Have you known Rodney long?”\n\n“Why, he is my teacher,” answered Arthur in some surprise.\n\nJasper’s eyes gleamed with sudden intelligence. So this was Rodney’s\nsecret, and this was the position for which he was so well paid.\n\nRodney bit his lip in vexation, but made no remark.\n\n“Does he ever punish you for not getting your lessons?” asked Jasper\nwithout much tact.\n\n“Of course not,” answered Arthur indignantly.\n\n“Arthur always does get his lessons,” said Rodney. “I suppose you have a\nholiday from work today, Jasper.”\n\n“Yes; I am glad to get away now and then.”\n\n“I must bid you good morning now.”\n\n“Won’t you let me call on you? Where do you live, Arthur?”\n\nThe boy gave the number of his house.\n\nJasper asked Arthur, thinking rightly that he would be more likely to\nget an answer from him than from Rodney. He walked away triumphantly,\nfeeling that he had made a discovery that might prove of advantage to\nhim.\n\n“Is that a friend of yours, Rodney?” asked little Arthur.\n\n“I have known him for some time.”\n\n“I don’t like him very much.”\n\n“Why?” asked Rodney with some curiosity.\n\n“I don’t know,” answered the little boy slowly. “I can’t like\neverybody.”\n\n“Quite true, Arthur. Jasper is not a special friend of mine, and I am\nnot particular about your liking him. I hope you like me.”\n\n“You know I do, Rodney,” and he gave Rodney’s hand an assuring pressure.\n\nTen minutes after he left Rodney, Jasper fell in with Carton. The\nintimacy between them had perceptibly fallen off. It had grown out of\nbusiness considerations.\n\nNow that it was no longer safe to abstract articles from the store,\nJasper felt that he had no more use for his late confederate. When they\nmet he treated him with marked coldness.\n\nOn this particular day Carton was looking quite shabby. In fact, his\nbest suit was in pawn, and he had fallen back on one half worn and\nsoiled.\n\n“Hello!” exclaimed Jasper, and was about to pass on with a cool nod.\n\n“Stop!” said Philip, looking offended.\n\n“I am in a hurry,” returned Jasper. “I can’t stop today.”\n\n“You are in a hurry, and on a holiday?”\n\n“Yes; I am to meet a friend near the lake.”\n\n“I’ll go along with you.”\n\nJasper had to submit though with an ill grace.\n\n“Wouldn’t another day do?”\n\n“No; the fact is, Jasper, I am in trouble,”\n\n“You usually are,” sneered Jasper.\n\n“That is so. I have been out of luck lately.”\n\n“I am sorry, but I can’t help it as I see.”\n\n“How much money do you think I have in my pocket?”\n\n“I don’t know, I am sure. I am not good at guessing conundrums.”\n\n“Just ten cents.”\n\n“That isn’t much,” said Jasper, indifferently.\n\n“Let me have a dollar, thats a good fellow!”\n\n“You seem to think I am made of money,” said Jasper sharply. “I haven’t\ngot much more myself.”\n\n“Then you might have. You get a good salary.”\n\n“Only seven dollars.”\n\n“You are able to keep most of it for yourself.”\n\n“Suppose I am? You seem to know a good deal of my affairs.”\n\n“Haven’t you any pity for an old friend?”\n\n“Yes, I’ll give you all the pity you want, but when it comes to money\nit’s a different matter. Here you are, a man of twenty six, ten years\nolder than me, and yet you expect me to help support you.”\n\n“You didn’t use to talk to me like that.”\n\n“Well, I do now. You didn’t use to try to get money out of me.”\n\n“Look here, Jasper! I am poor, but I don’t want you to talk to me as you\nare doing.”\n\n“Indeed!” sneered Jasper.\n\n“And I won’t have it,” said Carton firmly. “Listen to me, and I will\npropose a plan that will help us both.”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“You can easily secrete articles, if you are cautious, without\nattracting notice, and I will dispose of them and share the money with\nyou.”\n\nJasper shook his head.\n\n“I wouldn’t dare to do it,” he said. “Somebody might spy on me.”\n\n“Not if you are careful.”\n\n“If it were found out I would be bounced like Ropes.”\n\n“What is he doing? Have you seen him lately?”\n\n“He is getting on finely. He is earning fifteen dollars a week.”\n\n“You don’t mean it?”\n\n“Yes I do.”\n\n“What firm is he working for?”\n\n“For none at all. He is tutor to a young kid.”\n\n“I didn’t know he was scholar enough.”\n\n“Oh yes, he knows Greek and Latin and a lot of other stuff.”\n\n“Who is the boy?”\n\n“I don’t feel at liberty to tell. I don’t think he would care to have\nyou know.”\n\n“I’ll tell you what you can do. Borrow five dollars of him for me.”\n\n“I don’t know about that. If I were to borrow it would be for myself.”\n\n“You can do as you please. If you don’t do something for me I will write\nto Mr. Goodnow that you are the thief who stole the cloaks and dress\npatterns.”\n\n“You wouldn’t do that?” exclaimed Jasper in consternation.\n\n“Wouldn’t I? I am desperate enough to do anything.”\n\nAfter a little further conference Jasper agreed to do what was asked of\nhim. He did not dare to refuse.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\nJASPER’S REVENGE\n\n\nRodney was considerably surprised one evening to receive a call from\nJasper in his room. He was alone, as Mike had been detailed about a\nweek ago for night duty. The room looked more attractive than formerly.\nRodney had bought a writing desk, which stood in the corner, and had put\nup three pictures, which, though cheap, were attractive.\n\n“Good evening, Jasper,” he said. “It is quite friendly of you to call.”\n\n“I hadn’t anything else on hand this evening, and thought I would come\nround see how you were getting along.”\n\n“Take a seat and make yourself at home.”\n\n“Do you object to cigarettes?” asked Jasper, producing one from a case\nin his pocket.\n\n“I object to smoking them myself, but I don’t want to dictate to my\nfriends.”\n\n“You look quite comfortable here,” continued Jasper in a patronizing\ntone.\n\n“We try to be comfortable, though our room is not luxurious.”\n\n“Who do you mean by ‘we’? Have you a room mate?”\n\n“Yes. Mike Flynn rooms with me.”\n\n“Who is he--a newsboy?”\n\n“No. He is a telegraph boy.”\n\n“You don’t seem to very particular,” said Jasper, shrugging his\nshoulders.\n\n“I am very particular.”\n\n“Yet you room with an Irish telegraph boy.”\n\n“He is a nice boy of good habit, and a devoted friend. What could I want\nmore?”\n\n“Oh, well, you have a right to consult your own taste.”\n\n“You have a nice home, no doubt.”\n\n“I live with my uncle. Yes, he has a good house, but I am not so\nindependent as if I had a room outide.”\n\n“How are things going on at the store?”\n\n“About the same as usual. Why don’t you come in some day?”\n\n“For two reasons; I am occupied during the day, and I don’t want to go\nwhere I am considered a thief.”\n\n“I wish I was getting your income. It is hard to get along on seven\ndollars a week.”\n\n“Still you have a nice home, and I suppose you have most of your salary\nto yourself.”\n\n“Yes, but there isn’t much margin in seven dollars. My uncle expects\nme to buy my own clothes. You were lucky to get out of the store. Old\nGoodnow ought to give me ten dollars.”\n\n“Don’t let him hear you speak of him as OLD Goodnow, Jasper.”\n\n“Oh, I’m smart enough for that. I mean to keep on the right side of the\nold chap. What sort of a man are you working for?”\n\n“Mr. Sargent is a fine man.”\n\n“He isn’t mean certainly. I should like to be in your shoes.”\n\n“If I hear of any similar position shall I mention your name?” asked\nRodney, smiling.\n\n“No; I could not take care of a kid. I hate them.”\n\n“Still Arthur is a nice boy.”\n\n“You are welcome to him. What do you have to teach?”\n\n“He is studying Latin and French, besides English branches.”\n\n“I know about as much of Latin and French as a cow. I couldn’t be a\nteacher. I say, Rodney,” and Jasper cleared his throat, “I want you to\ndo me a favor.”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“I want you to lend me ten dollars.”\n\nRodney was not mean, but he knew very well that a loan to Jasper would\nbe a permanent one. Had Jasper been his friend even this consideration\nwould not have inspired a refusal, but he knew very well that Jasper had\nnot a particle of regard for him.\n\n“I don’t think I can oblige you, Jasper,” he said.\n\n“Why not? You get fifteen dollars a week.”\n\n“My expenses are considerable. Besides I am helping Mike, whose salary\nis very small. I pay the whole of the rent and I have paid for some\nclothes for him.”\n\n“You are spending your money very foolishly,” said Jasper frowning.\n\n“Would I spend it any less foolishly if I should lend you ten dollars?”\n\n“There is some difference between Mike Flynn and me. I am a gentleman.”\n\n“So is Mike.”\n\n“A queer sort of gentleman! He is only a poor telegraph boy.”\n\n“Still he is a gentleman.”\n\n“I should think you might have money enough for both of us.”\n\n“I might but I want to save something from my salary. I don’t know how\nlong I shall be earning as much. I might lose my place.”\n\n“So you might.”\n\n“And I could hardly expect to get another where the pay would be as\ngood.”\n\n“I would pay you on installment--a dollar a week,” urged Jasper.\n\n“I don’t see how you could, as you say your pay is too small for you\nnow.”\n\n“Oh, well, I could manage.”\n\n“I am afraid I can’t oblige you, Jasper,” said Rodney in a decided tone.\n\n“I didn’t think you were so miserly,” answered Jasper in vexation.\n\n“You may call it so, if you like. You must remember that I am not\nsituated like you. You have your uncle to fall back upon in case you\nlose your position, but I have no one. I have to hustle for myself.”\n\n“Oh, you needn’t make any more excuses. I suppose ten dollars is rather\na large sum to lend. Can you lend me five?”\n\n“I am sorry, but I must refuse you.”\n\nJasper rose from the chair on which he had been sitting.\n\n“Then I may as well go,” he said. “I am disappointed in you, Ropes. I\nthought you were a good, whole souled fellow, and not a miser.”\n\n“You must think of me as you please, Jasper. I feel that I have a right\nto regulate my own affairs.”\n\n“All I have to say is this, if you lose your place as you may very soon,\ndon’t come round to the store and expect to be taken back.”\n\n“I won’t,” answered Rodney, smiling. “I wouldn’t go back at any rate\nunless the charge of theft was withdrawn.”\n\n“That will never be!”\n\n“Let it be so, as long as I am innocent.”\n\nJasper left the room abruptly, not even having the politeness to bid\nRodney good evening.\n\nRodney felt that he was quite justified in refusing to lend Jasper\nmoney. Had he been in need he would have obliged him, though he had no\nreason to look upon him as a friend.\n\nNo one who knew Rodney could regard him as mean or miserly. Could he\nhave read Jasper’s thoughts as he left the house he would have felt even\nless regret at disappointing him.\n\nAbout two days afterward when Rodney went up to meet his pupil, Mr.\nSargent handed him a letter.\n\n“Here is something that concerns you, Rodney,” he said. “It doesn’t\nappear to be from a friend of yours.”\n\nWith some curiosity Rodney took the letter and read it.\n\nIt ran thus:\n\n\nMr. JOHN SARGENT:\n\nDEAR SIR--I think it my duty to write and tell you something about\nyour son’s tutor--something that will surprise and shock you. Before\nhe entered your house he was employed by a firm on Reade Street. He was\nquite a favorite with his employer, Mr. Otis Goodnow, who promoted him\nin a short time. All at once it was found that articles were missing\nfrom the stock. Of course it was evident that some one of the clerks was\ndishonest. A watch was set, and finally it was found that Rodney Ropes\nhad taken the articles, and one--a lady’s cloak--was found in his room\nby a detective. He was discharged at once without a recommendation.\n\nFor a time he lived by selling papers, but at last he managed to get\ninto your house. I am sure you won’t regard him as fit to educate\nyour little son, though I have no doubt he is a good scholar. But his\ncharacter is bad--I don’t think he ought to have concealed this from you\nout of friendship for you, and because I think it is my duty, I take the\nliberty of writing. If you doubt this I will refer to Mr. Goodnow,\nor Mr. James Redwood, who had charge of the room in which Ropes was\nemployed. Yours very respectfully,\n                                        A FRIEND.\n\n\n“You knew all this before, Mr. Sargent,” said Rodney, as he handed back\nthe letter.\n\n“Yes. Have you any idea who wrote it?”\n\n“I feel quite sure that it was a boy about two years older than myself,\nJasper Redwood.”\n\n“Is he related to the man of the same name whom he mentions?”\n\n“Yes, he is his nephew.”\n\n“Has he any particular reason for disliking you, Rodney?”\n\n“Yes, sir. He came round to my room Wednesday evening, and asked me to\nlend him ten dollars.”\n\n“I presume you refused.”\n\n“Yes, sir. He is not in need. He succeeded to my place, and he has a\nhome at the house of his uncle.”\n\n“He appears to be a very mean boy. Anonymous letters are always\ncowardly, and generally malicious. This seems to be no exception to the\ngeneral rule.”\n\n“I hope it won’t affect your feelings towards me, Mr. Sargent.”\n\n“Don’t trouble yourself about that Rodney. I am not so easily prejudiced\nagainst one of whom I have a good opinion.”\n\n“I suppose this is Jasper’s revenge,” thought Rodney.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n\nRODNEY LOSES HIS PUPIL.\n\n\nJasper had little doubt that his letter would lead to Rodney’s loss of\nposition. It was certainly a mean thing to plot another’s downfall,\nbut Jasper was quite capable of it. Had he secured the loan he asked he\nwould have been willing to leave Rodney alone, but it would only have\nbeen the first of a series of similar applications.\n\nIt was several days before Jasper had an opportunity of learning whether\nhis malicious plan had succeeded or not. On Sunday forenoon he met\nRodney on Fifth Avenue just as the church services were over. He crossed\nthe street and accosted the boy he had tried to injure.\n\n“Good morning, Ropes,” he said, examining Rodney’s face curiously to see\nwhether it indicated trouble of any kind.\n\n“Good morning!” responded Rodney coolly.\n\n“How are you getting along in your place?”\n\n“Very well, thank you.”\n\n“Shall I find you at your pupil’s house if I call there some afternoon?”\n\n“Yes, unless I am out walking with Arthur.”\n\n“I wonder whether he’s bluffing,” thought Jasper. “I daresay he wouldn’t\ntell me if he had been discharged. He takes it pretty coolly.”\n\n“How long do you think your engagement will last?” he asked.\n\n“I don’t know. I never had a talk with Mr. Sargent on that point.”\n\n“Do you still give satisfaction?”\n\nRodney penetrated Jasper’s motives for asking all these questions, and\nwas amused.\n\n“I presume if I fail to satisfy Mr. Sargent he will tell me so.”\n\n“It would be a nice thing if you could stay there three or four years.”\n\n“Yes: but I don’t anticipate it. When Arthur get a little older he will\nbe sent to school.”\n\n“What will you do then?”\n\n“I haven’t got so far as that.”\n\n“I can’t get anything out of him,” said Jasper to himself. “I shouldn’t\nbe a bit surprised if he were already discharged.”\n\nThey had now reached Madison Square, and Jasper left Rodney.\n\nThe latter looked after him with a smile.\n\n“I think I have puzzled Jasper,” he said to himself. “He was anxious to\nknow how his scheme had worked. He will have to wait a little longer.”\n\n“If Mr. Sargent keeps Ropes after my letter he must be a fool,” Jasper\ndecided. “I wonder if Ropes handles the mail. He might have suppressed\nthe letter.”\n\nBut Rodney was not familiar with his handwriting, and would have no\nreason to suspect that the particular letter contained anything likely\nto injure him in the eyes of Mr. Sargent.\n\nLater in his walk Jasper met Philip Carton. His former friend was\nsitting on a bench in Madison Square. He called out to Jasper as he\npassed.\n\n“Come here, Jasper, I want to talk with you.”\n\nJasper looked at him in a manner far from friendly.\n\n“I am in a hurry,” he said.\n\n“What hurry can you be in? Come and sit down here. I MUST speak to you.”\n\nJasper did not like his tone, but it impressed him, and he did not dare\nto refuse.\n\nHe seated himself beside Philip, but looked at him askance. Carton was\nundeniably shabby. He had the look of a man who was going down hill and\nthat rapidly.\n\n“I shall be late for dinner,” grumbled Jasper.\n\n“I wish I had any dinner to look forward to,” said Carton. “Do you see\nthis money?” and he produced a nickel from his pocket.\n\n“What is there remarkable about it?”\n\n“It is the last money I have. It won’t buy me a dinner.”\n\n“I am sorry, but it is none of my business,” said Jasper coolly. “You\nare old enough to attend to your own affairs.”\n\n“And I once thought you were my friend,” murmured Philip bitterly.\n\n“Yes, we were friends in a way.”\n\n“Now you are up and I am down--Jasper, I want a dollar.”\n\n“I dare say you do. Plenty want that.”\n\n“I want it from you.”\n\n“I can’t spare it.”\n\n“You can spare it better than you can spare your situation.”\n\n“What do you mean by that?” asked Jasper, growing nervous.\n\n“I’ll tell you what I mean. How long do you think you would stay in\nthe store if Mr. Goodnow knew that you were concerned in the theft from\nwhich he has suffered?”\n\n“Was I the only one?”\n\n“No; I am equally guilty.”\n\n“I am glad you acknowledge it. You see you had better keep quiet for\nyour own sake.”\n\n“If I keep quiet I shall starve.”\n\n“Do you want to go to prison?”\n\n“I shouldn’t mind so much if you went along, too.”\n\n“Are you crazy, Philip Carton?”\n\n“No, I am not, but I am beginning to get sensible. If I go to prison I\nshall at least have enough to eat, and now I haven’t.”\n\n“What do you mean by all this foolish talk?”\n\n“I mean that if you won’t give me any money I will go to the store and\ntell Mr. Goodnow something that will surprise him.”\n\nJasper was getting thoroughly frightened.\n\n“Come, Philip.” he said, “listen to reason. You know how poor I am.”\n\n“No doubt. I know you have a good home and enough to eat.”\n\n“I only get seven dollars a week.”\n\n“And I get nothing.”\n\n“I have already been trying to help you. I went to Ropes the other day,\nand asked him to lend me five dollars. I meant it for you.”\n\n“Did he give it to you?”\n\n“He wouldn’t give me a cent. He is mean and miserly!”\n\n“I don’t know. He knows very well that you are no friend of his, though\nhe doesn’t know how much harm you have done him.”\n\n“He’s rolling in money. However, I’ve put a spoke in his wheel, I hope.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“I wrote an anonymous letter to Mr. Sargent telling him that Ropes was\ndischarged from the store on suspicion of theft.”\n\n“You are a precious scamp, Jasper.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“You are not content with getting Ropes discharged for something which\nyou yourself did----”\n\n“And you too.”\n\n“And I too. I accept the amendment. Not content with that, you try to\nget him discharged from his present position.”\n\n“Then he might have lent me the money,” said Jasper sullenly.\n\n“It wouldn’t have been a loan. It would have been a gift. But no matter\nabout that. I want a dollar.”\n\n“I can’t give it to you.”\n\n“Then I shall call at the store tomorrow morning and tell Mr. Goodnow\nabout the stolen goods.”\n\nFinding that Carton was in earnest Jasper finally, but with great\nreluctance, drew out a dollar and handed it to his companion.\n\n“There, I hope that will satisfy you,” he said spitefully.\n\n“It will--for the present.”\n\n“I wish he’d get run over or something,” thought Jasper. “He seems to\nexpect me to support him, and that on seven dollars a week.”\n\nFortunately for Jasper, Philip Carton obtained employment the next day\nwhich lasted for some time, and as he was paid ten dollars a week he was\nnot under the necessity of troubling his old confederate for loans.\n\nNow and then Jasper and Rodney met, but there were no cordial relations\nbetween them. Jasper could not forgive Rodney for refusing to lend him\nmoney, and Rodney was not likely to forget the anonymous letter by which\nJasper had tried to injure him.\n\nSo three months passed. One day Mr. Sargent arrived at home before it\nwas time for Rodney to leave.\n\n“I am glad to see you, Rodney,” said his employer. “I have some news for\nyou which I am afraid will not be entirely satisfactory to you.”\n\n“What is it, sir?”\n\n“For the last three years I have been wishing to go to Europe with my\nwife and Arthur. The plan has been delayed, because I could not make\nsatisfactory business arrangements. Now, however, that difficulty has\nbeen overcome, and I propose to sail in about two weeks.”\n\n“I hope you’ll enjoy your trip, sir.”\n\n“Thank you. Of course it will terminate, for a time at least your\nengagement to teach Arthur.”\n\n“I shall be sorry for that, sir, but I am not selfish enough to want you\nto stay at home on that account.”\n\n“I thought you would feel that way. I wish I could procure you another\nposition before I go, but that is uncertain. I shall, however, pay you a\nmonth’s salary in advance in lieu of a notice.”\n\n“That is very liberal, sir.”\n\n“I think it only just. I have been very well pleased with your attention\nto Arthur, and I know he has profited by your instructions as well\nas enjoyed your companionship. I hope you have been able to save\nsomething.”\n\n“Yes, sir, I have something in the Union Dime Savings Bank.”\n\n“That’s well. You will remain with me one week longer, but the last week\nArthur will need for preparations.”\n\nTwo weeks later Rodney stood on the pier and watched the stately Etruria\nsteam out into the river. Arthur and his father were on deck, and the\nlittle boy waved his handkerchief to his tutor as long as he could see\nhim.\n\nRodney turned away sadly.\n\n“I have lost a good situation,” he soliloquized. “When shall I get\nanother?”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n\nCONTINUED ILL LUCK.\n\n\nRodney set himself to work searching for a new situation. But\nwherever he called he found Some one ahead of him. At length he saw an\nadvertisement for an entry clerk in a wholesale house in Church Street.\nHe applied and had the good fortune to please the superintendent.\n\n“Where have you worked before?” he asked.\n\n“At Otis Goodnow’s, on Reade Street.”\n\n“How much were you paid there?”\n\n“Seven dollars a week.”\n\n“Very well, we will start you on that salary, and see if you earn it.”\n\nRodney was surprised and relieved to find that he was not asked for a\nrecommendation from Mr. Goodnow, knowing that he could not obtain one.\nHe went to work on a Monday morning, and found his duties congenial and\nsatisfactory.\n\nSeven dollars a week was small, compared with what he had received as a\ntutor, but he had about two hundred and fifty dollars in the Union Dime\nSavings Bank and drew three dollars from this fund every week in order\nthat he might still assist Mike, whose earnings were small.\n\nOne of his new acquaintances in the store was James Hicks, a boy about a\nyear older than himself.\n\n“Didn’t you use to work at Otis Goodnow’s?” asked James one day when\nthey were going to lunch.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I know a boy employed there. He is older than either of us.”\n\n“Who is it?”\n\n“Jasper Redwood. Of course you know him.”\n\n“Yes,” answered Rodney with a presentiment of evil.\n\nHe felt that it would be dangerous to have Jasper know of his present\nposition, but did not venture to give a hint of this to James.\n\nHis fears were not groundless. Only the day after James met Jasper on\nthe street.\n\n“Anything new?” asked Jasper.\n\n“Yes; we’ve got one of your old friends in our store.”\n\n“Who is it?”\n\n“Rodney Ropes.”\n\nJasper stopped short, and whistled. He was excessively surprised, as he\nsupposed Rodney still to be Arthur Sargent’s tutor.\n\n“You don’t mean it?” he ejaculated.\n\n“Why not? Is there anything so strange about it?”\n\n“Yes. Did Ropes bring a recommendation from Mr. Goodnow?”\n\n“I suppose so. I don’t know.”\n\n“If he did, it’s forged.”\n\n“Why should it be?”\n\n“Goodnow wouldn’t give him a recommendation.”\n\n“Why wouldn’t he?”\n\n“Because he discharged Ropes. Do you want to know why?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“For stealing articles from the store.”\n\nIt was the turn of James Hicks to be surprised.\n\n“I can’t believe it,” he said.\n\n“Its true. Just mention the matter to Ropes, and you’ll see he won’t\ndeny it.”\n\n“I think there must be some mistake about it. Rodney doesn’t look like a\nfellow that would steal.”\n\n“Oh, you can’t tell from appearances--Rogues are always plausible.”\n\n“Still mistakes are sometimes made. I’d trust Rodney Ropes sooner than\nany boy I know.”\n\n“You don’t know him as well as I do.”\n\n“You don’t like him?” said James shrewdly.\n\n“No I don’t. I can’t like a thief.”\n\n“You talk as if you had a grudge against him.”\n\n“Nothing but his being a thief. Well, what are you going to do about\nit?”\n\n“About what?”\n\n“What I have just told you.”\n\n“I don’t feel that I have any call to do anything.”\n\n“You ought to tell your employer.”\n\n“I am no telltale,” said James scornfully.\n\n“Then you will let him stay in the store, knowing him to be a thief?”\n\n“I don’t know him to be a thief. If he steals anything it will probably\nbe found out.”\n\nJasper urged James to give information about Rodney, but he steadily\nrefused.\n\n“I leave others to do such dirty work,” he said, “and I don’t think any\nbetter of you, let me tell you, for your eagerness to turn the boy out\nof his position.”\n\n“You are a queer boy.”\n\n“Think so if you like,” retorted Hicks. “I might give my opinion of\nyou.”\n\nAt this point Jasper thought it best to let the conversation drop. He\nwas much pleased to learn that Rodney had lost his fine position as\ntutor, and was now in a place from which he might more easily be ousted.\n\nAs he could not prevail upon James Hicks to betray Rodney he decided to\nwrite an anonymous letter to the firm that employed him.\n\nThe result was that the next afternoon Rodney was summoned to the\noffice.\n\n“Sit down Ropes,” said the superintendent. “For what store did you work\nbefore you came into our house?”\n\n“Otis Goodnow’s.”\n\n“Under what circumstances did you leave?”\n\n“I was accused of theft.”\n\n“You did not mention this matter when you applied for a situation here.”\n\n“No, sir. I ought perhaps to have done so, but I presumed in that case\nyou would not have given me a place.”\n\n“You are right he would not.”\n\n“Nor would I have applied had the charge been a true one. Articles were\ncertainly missing from Mr. Goodnow’s stock, but in accusing me they did\nme a great injustice.”\n\n“How long since you left Mr. Goodnow’s?”\n\n“Four months.”\n\n“What have you been doing since?”\n\n“I was acting as tutor to the son of Mr. Sargent, of West Fifty Eighth\nStreet.”\n\n“A well known citizen. Then you are a scholar?”\n\n“Yes, sir, I am nearly prepared for college.”\n\n“Of course he did not know you were suspected of dishonesty.”\n\n“On the contrary he did know it. I told him, and later he received an\nanonymous letter, notifying him of the fact.”\n\n“We also have received an anonymous letter. Here it is. Do you recognize\nthe hand writing?”\n\n“Yes,” answered Rodney after examining the letter. “It was written by\nJasper Redwood.”\n\n“Who is he?”\n\n“A boy employed by Mr. Goodnow. For some reason he seems to have a spite\nagainst me.”\n\n“I admit that it is pretty small business to write an anonymous letter\ncalculated to injure another. Still we shall have to take notice of\nthis.”\n\n“Yes, sir, I suppose so.”\n\n“I shall have to bring it to the notice of the firm. What they may do I\ndon’t know. If the matter was to be decided by me I would let you stay.”\n\n“Thank you, sir,” said Rodney gratefully.\n\n“But I am not Mr. Hall. You can go now and I will see you again.”\n\nRodney left the office fully persuaded that his engagement would\nspeedily terminate. He was right; the next day he was sent for again.\n\n“I am sorry to tell you, Ropes,” said the superintendent kindly “that\nMr. Hall insists upon your being discharged. He is a nervous man and\nrather suspicious. I spoke in your favor but I could not turn him.”\n\n“At any rate I am grateful to you for your friendly effort.”\n\nThe superintendent hesitated a moment, and then said: “Will this\ndischarge seriously embarrass you? Are you short of money?”\n\n“No, sir. I was very liberally paid by Mr. Sargent, and I saved money.\nI have enough in the savings bank to last me several months, should I be\nidle so long.”\n\n“I am glad of it. I hope you will remember, my boy, that this is none of\nmy doing. I would gladly retain you. I will say one thing more, should\nJasper Redwood ever apply for a situation here, his name will not be\nconsidered.”\n\nSo Rodney found himself again without a position. It seemed hard in view\nof his innocence, but he had confidence to believe that something would\nturn up for him as before. At any rate he had enough money to live on\nfor some time.\n\nWhen Mike Flynn learned the circumstances of his discharge he was very\nangry.\n\n“I’d like to meet Jasper Redwood,” he said, his eyes flashing. “If I\ndidn’t give him a laying out then my name isn’t Mike Flynn.”\n\n“I think he will get his desert some time, Mickey, without any help from\nyou or me.”\n\n“Should hope he will. And what’ll you do now, Rodney?”\n\n“I don’t know. Sometimes I think it would be well to go to some other\ncity, Boston or Philadelphia, where Jasper can’t get on my track.”\n\n“Should hope you won’t do it. I can’t get along widout you.”\n\n“I will stay here for a few weeks, Mike, and see if anything turns up.”\n\n“I might get you in as a telegraph boy.”\n\n“That wouldn’t suit me. It doesn’t pay enough.”\n\nRodney began to hunt for a situation again, but four weeks passed and\nbrought him no success. One afternoon about four o’clock he was walking\nup Broadway when, feeling tired, he stepped into the Continental Hotel\nat the corner of Twentieth Street.\n\nHe took a seat at some distance back from the door, and in a desultory\nway began to look about him. All at once he started in surprise, for\nin a man sitting in one of the front row of chairs he recognized Louis\nWheeler, the railroad thief who had stolen his box of jewelry.\n\nWheeler was conversing with a man with a large flapping sombrero, and\nwhose dress and general appearance indicated that he was a Westerner.\n\nRodney left his seat and going forward sat down in the chair behind\nWheeler. He suspected that the Western man was in danger of being\nvictimized.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\nAN OLD ACQUAINTANCE TURNS UP.\n\n\nIn his new position Rodney could easily hear the conversation which took\nplace between the Western man and his old railroad acquaintance.\n\n“I am quite a man of leisure,” said Wheeler, “and it will give me great\npleasure to go about with you and show you our city.”\n\n“You are very obliging.”\n\n“Oh, don’t mention it. I shall really be glad to have my time occupied.\nYou see I am a man of means--my father left me a fortune--and so I am\nnot engaged in any business.”\n\n“You are in luck. I was brought up on a farm in Vermont, and had to\nborrow money to take me to Montana four years ago.”\n\n“I hope you prospered in your new home?”\n\n“I did. I picked up twenty five thousand dollars at the mines, and\ndoubled it by investment in lots in Helena.”\n\n“Very neat, indeed. I inherited a fortune from my father--a hundred and\ntwenty five thousand dollars--but I never made a cent myself. I don’t\nknow whether I am smart enough.”\n\n“Come out to Montana and I’ll put you in a way of making some money.”\n\n“Really, now, that suggestion strikes me favorably. I believe I will\nfollow your advice. When shall you return to your Western home?”\n\n“In about a fortnight I think.”\n\n“You must go to the theater tonight. There is a good play on at the\nMadison Square.”\n\n“I don’t mind. When can I get ticket?”\n\n“I’ll go and secure some. It is only a few blocks away.”\n\n“Do so. How much are the tickets?”\n\n“A dollar and a half or two dollars each.”\n\n“Here are five dollars, if it won’t trouble you too much.”\n\n“My dear friend, I meant to pay for the tickets. However, I will pay\nnext time. If you will remain here I will be back in twenty minutes.”\n\nLouis Wheeler left the hotel with the five dollars tucked away in his\nvest pocket.\n\nHe had no sooner disappeared than Rodney went forward and occupied his\nseat.\n\n“Excuse me, sir,” he said to the miner, “but do you know much of the man\nwho has just left you?”\n\n“I only met him here. He seems a good natured fellow. What of him?”\n\n“He said he was a man of independent means.”\n\n“Isn’t he?”\n\n“He is a thief and an adventurer.”\n\nThe miner was instantly on the alert.\n\n“How do you know this?” he asked.\n\n“Because he stole a box of jewelry from me in the cars some months ago.”\n\n“Did you get it again?”\n\n“Yes; he left the train, but I followed him up and reclaimed the\njewelry.”\n\n“Was it of much value?”\n\n“They were family jewels, and were worth over a thousand dollars.”\n\n“Do you think he wants to bunco me?”\n\n“I have no doubt of it.”\n\n“I have given him money to buy theater tickets. Do you think he will\ncome back?”\n\n“Yes. He wouldn’t be satisfied with that small sum.”\n\n“Tell me about your adventure with him.”\n\n“I will do it later. The theater is so near that he might come back and\nsurprise us together. I think he would recognize me.”\n\n“Do you advise me to go to the theater?”\n\n“Yes, but be on your guard.”\n\n“Where can I see you again?”\n\n“Are you staying at this hotel?”\n\n“Yes. Here is my card.”\n\nRodney read this name on the card:\n\n\nJEFFERSON PETTRIGREW.\n\n\n“I wish you were going to the theater with us.”\n\n“It wouldn’t do. Mr. Wheeler would remember me.”\n\n“Then come round and breakfast with me tomorrow--at eight o’clock,\nsharp.”\n\n“I will, sir. Now I will take a back seat, and leave you to receive your\nfriend.”\n\n“Don’t call him my friend. He seems to be a mean scoundrel.”\n\n“Don’t let him suspect anything from your manner.”\n\n“I won’t. I want to see him expose his plans.” Five minutes afterwards\nLouis Wheeler entered the hotel.\n\n“I’ve got the tickets,” he said, “but I had to buy them of a speculator,\nand they cost me more than I expected.”\n\n“How much?”\n\n“Two and a half apiece. So there is no change coming back to you.”\n\n“Never mind! As long as you had enough money to pay for them it is all\nright.”\n\nAs a matter of fact Wheeler bought the tickets at the box office at one\ndollar and fifty cent each, which left him a profit of two dollars.\nWhen he saw how easily the Western man took it he regretted not having\nrepresented that the tickets cost three dollars each.\n\nHowever, he decided that there would be other ways of plundering his new\nacquaintance. He took his seat again next to the miner.\n\n“It is not very late,” he said. “Would you like a run out to Central\nPark or to Grant’s Tomb?”\n\n“Not today. I feel rather tired. By the way, you did not mention your\nname.”\n\n“I haven’t a card with me, but my name is Louis Wheeler.”\n\n“Where do you live, Mr. Wheeler?”\n\n“I am staying with an aunt on Fifth Avenue, but I think of taking board\nat the Windsor Hotel. It is a very high toned house, and quite a number\nof my friends board there.”\n\n“Is it an expensive hotel?”\n\n“Oh, yes, but my income is large and----”\n\n“I understand. Now, Mr. Wheeler, I must excuse myself, as I feel tired.\nCome at half past seven and we can start for the theater together.”\n\n“Very well.”\n\nWheeler rose reluctantly, for he had intended to secure a dinner from\nhis new acquaintance, but he was wise enough to take the hint.\n\nAfter he left the room Rodney again joined Mr. Pettigrew.\n\n“He didn’t give me back any change,” said the Western man. “He said he\nbought the tickets of a speculator at two dollars and a half each.”\n\n“Then he made two dollars out of you.”\n\n“I suppose that is the beginning. Well, that doesn’t worry me. But I\nshould like to know how he expects to get more money out of me. I don’t\nunderstand the ways of this gentry.”\n\n“Nor I very well. If you are on your guard I think you won’t be in any\ndanger.”\n\n“I will remember what you say. You seem young to act as adviser to a man\nlike me. Are you in business?”\n\n“At present I am out of work, but I have money enough to last me three\nmonths.”\n\n“Are you, like my new acquaintance, possessed of independent means?”\n\n“Not now, but I was six months ago.”\n\n“How did you lose your money?”\n\n“I did not lose it. My guardian lost it for me.”\n\n“What is your name?”\n\n“Rodney Ropes.”\n\n“You’ve had some pretty bad luck. Come up to my room and tell me about\nit.”\n\n“I shall be glad to do so, sir.”\n\nMr. Pettigrew called for his key and led the way up to a plain room on\nthe third floor.\n\n“Come in,” he said. “The room is small, but I guess it will hold us\nboth. Now go ahead with your story.”\n\nIn a short time Rodney had told his story in full to his new\nacquaintance, encouraged to do so by his sympathetic manner. Mr.\nPettigrew was quite indignant, when told of Jasper’s mean and\ntreacherous conduct.\n\n“That boy Jasper is a snake in the grass,” he said. “I’d like to give\nhim a good thrashing.”\n\n“There isn’t any love lost between us, Mr. Pettigrew, but I think it\nwill turn out right in the end. Still I find it hard to get a place in\nNew York with him circulating stories about me.”\n\n“Then why do you stay in New York?”\n\n“I have thought it might be better to go to Philadelphia or Boston.”\n\n“I can tell you of a better place than either.”\n\n“What is that?”\n\n“Montana.”\n\n“Do you really think it would be wise for me to go there?”\n\n“Think? I haven’t a doubt about it.”\n\n“I have money enough to get there, but not much more. I should soon have\nto find work, or I might get stranded.”\n\n“Come back with me, and I’ll see you through. I’ll make a bargain with\nyou. Go round with me here, and I’ll pay your fare out to Montana.”\n\n“If you are really in earnest I will do so, and thank you for the\noffer.”\n\n“Jefferson Pettigrew means what he says. I’ll see you through, Rodney.”\n\n“But I may be interfering with your other friend, Louis Wheeler.”\n\n“I shall soon be through with him. You needn’t worry yourself about\nthat.”\n\nMr. Pettigrew insisted upon Rodney’s taking supper with him. Fifteen\nminutes after Rodney left him Mr. Wheeler made his appearance.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\nMR. WHEELER HAS A SET BACK.\n\n\nLouis Wheeler had not seen Rodney in the hotel office, and probably\nwould not have recognized him if he had, as Rodney was quite differently\ndressed from the time of their first meeting. He had no reason to\nsuppose, therefore, that Mr. Pettigrew had been enlightened as to his\nreal character.\n\nIt was therefore with his usual confidence that he accosted his\nacquaintance from Montana after supper.\n\n“It is time to go to the theater, Mr. Pettigrew,” he said.\n\nJefferson Pettigrew scanned his new acquaintance with interest. He\nhad never before met a man of his type and he looked upon him as a\ncuriosity.\n\nHe was shrewd, however, and did not propose to let Wheeler know that he\nunderstood his character. He resolved for the present to play the part\nof the bluff and unsuspecting country visitor.\n\n“You are very kind, Mr. Wheeler,” he said, “to take so much trouble for\na stranger.”\n\n“My dear sir,” said Wheeler effusively, “I wouldn’t do it for many\npersons, but I have taken a fancy to you.”\n\n“You don’t mean so?” said Pettigrew, appearing pleased?\n\n“Yes, I do, on my honor.”\n\n“But I don’t see why you should. You are a polished city gentleman and I\nam an ignorant miner from Montana.”\n\nLouis Wheeler looked complacent when he was referred to as a polished\ncity gentleman.\n\n“You do yourself injustice, my dear Pettigrew,” he said in a patronizing\nmanner. “You do indeed. You may not be polished, but you are certainly\nsmart, as you have shown by accumulating a fortune.”\n\n“But I am not as rich as you.”\n\n“Perhaps not, but if I should lose my money, I could not make another\nfortune, while I am sure you could. Don’t you think it would be a good\nplan for us to start a business together in New York?”\n\n“Would you really be willing to go into business with me?”\n\nJefferson Pettigrew asked this question with so much apparent sincerity\nthat Wheeler was completely deceived.\n\n“I’ve got him dead!” he soliloquized complacently.\n\nHe hooked his arm affectionately in the Montana miner’s and said,\n“My dear friend, I have never met a man with whom I would rather\nbe associated in business than with you. How much capital could you\ncontribute?”\n\n“I will think it over, Mr. Wheeler. By the way what business do you\npropose that we shall go into?”\n\n“I will think it over and report to you.”\n\nBy this time they had reached the theater. The play soon commenced. Mr.\nPettigrew enjoyed it highly, for he had not had much opportunity at the\nWest of attending a high class theatrical performance.\n\nWhen the play ended, Louis Wheeler said, “Suppose we go to Delmonico’s\nand have a little refreshment.”\n\n“Very well.”\n\nThey adjourned to the well known restaurant, and Mr. Pettigrew ordered\nan ice and some cakes, but his companion made a hearty supper. When the\nbill came, Louis Wheeler let it lie on the table, but Mr. Pettigrew did\nnot appear to see it.\n\n“I wonder if he expects me to pay for it,” Wheeler asked himself\nanxiously.\n\n“Thank you for this pleasant little supper,” said Pettigrew\nmischievously. “Delmonico’s is certainly a fine place.”\n\nWheeler changed color. He glanced at the check. It was for two dollars\nand seventy five cents, and this represented a larger sum than he\npossessed.\n\nHe took the check and led the way to the cashier’s desk. Then he\nexamined his pockets.\n\n“By Jove,” he said, “I left my wallet in my other coat. May I borrow\nfive dollars till tomorrow?”\n\nJefferson Pettigrew eyed him shrewdly. “Never mind,” he said, “I will\npay the check.”\n\n“I am very much ashamed of having put you to this expense.”\n\n“If that is all you have to be ashamed of Mr. Wheeler,” said the miner\npointedly, “you can rest easy.”\n\n“What do you mean?” stammered Wheeler.\n\n“Wait till we get into the street, and I will tell you.”\n\nThey went out at the Broadway entrance, and then Mr. Pettigrew turned to\nhis new acquaintance.\n\n“I think I will bid you good night and good by at the same time, Mr.\nWheeler,” he said.\n\n“My dear sir, I hoped you won’t misjudge me on account of my\nunfortunately leaving my money at home.”\n\n“I only wish to tell you that I have not been taken in by your plausible\nstatement, Mr. Wheeler, if that is really your name. Before we started\nfor the theater I had gauged you and taken your measure.”\n\n“Sir, I hope you don’t mean to insult me!” blustered Wheeler.\n\n“Not at all. You have been mistaken in me, but I am not mistaken in you.\nI judge you to be a gentlemanly adventurer, ready to take advantage of\nany who have money and are foolish enough to be gulled by your tricks.\nYou are welcome to the profit you made out of the theater tickets, also\nto the little supper to which you have done so much justice. I must\nrequest you, now, however, to devote yourself to some one else, as I do\nnot care to meet you again.”\n\nLouis Wheeler slunk away, deciding that he had made a great mistake in\nsetting down his Montana acquaintance as an easy victim.\n\n“I didn’t think he’d get on to my little game so quick,” he reflected.\n“He’s sharper than he looks.”\n\nRodney took breakfast with Mr. Pettigrew the next morning. When\nbreakfast was over, the Montana man said:\n\n“I’m going to make a proposal to you, Rodney. How much pay did you get\nat your last place?”\n\n“Seven dollars a week.”\n\n“I’ll pay you that and give you your meals. In return I want you to keep\nme company and go about with me.”\n\n“I shall not be apt to refuse such an offer as that, Mr. Pettigrew, but\nare you sure you prefer me to Mr. Wheeler?” laughed Rodney.\n\n“Wheeler be--blessed!” returned the miner.\n\n“How long are you going to stay in New York?”\n\n“About two weeks. Then I shall go back to Montana and take you with me.”\n\n“Thank you. There is nothing I should like better.”\n\nTwo days later, as the two were walking along Broadway, they met Mr.\nWheeler. The latter instantly recognized his friend from Montana, and\nscrutinized closely his young companion.\n\nRodney’s face looked strangely familiar to him, but somehow he could not\nrecollect when or under what circumstances he had met him. He did not,\nhowever, like to give up his intended victim, but had the effrontery to\naddress the man from Montana.\n\n“I hope you are well, Mr. Pettigrew.”\n\n“Thank you, I am very well.”\n\n“I hope you are enjoying yourself. I should be glad to show you the\nsights. Have you been to Grants Tomb?”\n\n“Not yet.”\n\n“I should like to take you there.”\n\n“Thank you, but I have a competent guide.”\n\n“Won’t you introduce me to the young gentleman?”\n\n“I don’t require any introduction to you, Mr. Wheeler,” said Rodney.\n\n“Where have I met you before?” asked Wheeler abruptly.\n\n“In the cars. I had a box of jewelry with me,” answered Rodney\nsignificantly.\n\nLouis Wheeler changed color. Now he remembered Rodney, and he was\nsatisfied that he owed to him the coolness with which the Western man\nhad treated him.\n\n“I remember you had,” he said spitefully, “but I don’t know how you came\nby it.”\n\n“It isn’t necessary that you should know. I remember I had considerable\ndifficulty in getting it out of your hands.”\n\n“Mr. Pettigrew,” said Wheeler angrily, “I feel interested in you, and\nI want to warn you against the boy who is with you. He is a dangerous\ncompanion.”\n\n“I dare say you are right,” said Pettigrew in a quizzical tone. “I shall\nlook after him sharply, and I thank you for your kind and considerate\nwarning. I don’t care to take up any more of your valuable time. Rodney,\nlet us be going.”\n\n“It must have been the kid that exposed me,” muttered Wheeler, as he\nwatched the two go down the street. “I will get even with him some time.\nThat man would have been good for a thousand dollars to me if I had not\nbeen interfered with.”\n\n“You have been warned against me, Mr. Pettigrew,” said Rodney, laughing.\n“Mr. Wheeler has really been very unkind in interfering with my plans.”\n\n“I shan’t borrow any trouble, or lie awake nights thinking about it,\nRodney. I don’t care to see or think of that rascal again.”\n\nThe week passed, and the arrangement between Mr. Pettigrew and Rodney\ncontinued to their mutual satisfaction. One morning, when Rodney came to\nthe Continental as usual, his new friend said: “I received a letter last\nevening from my old home in Vermont.”\n\n“I hope it contained good news.”\n\n“On the contrary it contained bad news. My parents are dead, but I have\nan old uncle and aunt living. When I left Burton he was comfortably\nfixed, with a small farm of his own, and two thousand dollars in bank.\nNow I hear that he is in trouble. He has lost money, and a knavish\nneighbor has threatened to foreclose a mortgage on the farm and turn out\nthe old people to die or go to the poorhouse.”\n\n“Is the mortgage a large one?”\n\n“It is much less than the value of the farm, but ready money is scarce\nin the town, and that old Sheldon calculates upon. Now I think of going\nto Burton to look up the matter.”\n\n“You must save your uncle, if you can, Mr. Pettigrew.”\n\n“I can and I will. I shall start for Boston this afternoon by the Fall\nRiver boat and I want you to go with me.”\n\n“I should enjoy the journey, Mr. Pettigrew.”\n\n“Then it is settled. Go home and pack your gripsack. You may be gone\nthree or four days.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\nA CHANGE OF SCENE.\n\n\n“Now,” said Mr. Pettigrew, when they were sitting side by side on the\nupper deck of the Puritan, the magnificent steamer on the Fall River\nline. “I want you to consent to a little plan that will mystify my old\nfriends and neighbors.”\n\n“What is it, Mr. Pettigrew?”\n\n“I have never written home about my good fortune; so far as they know I\nam no better off than when I went away.”\n\n“I don’t think I could have concealed my success.”\n\n“It may seem strange, but I’ll explain--I want to learn who are my\nfriends and who are not. I am afraid I wasn’t very highly thought of\nwhen I left Burton. I was considered rather shiftless.\n\n“I was always in for a good time, and never saved a cent. Everybody\npredicted that I would fail, and I expect most wanted me to fail. There\nwere two or three, including my uncle, aunt and the friend who lent me\nmoney, who wished me well.\n\n“I mustn’t forget to mention the old minister who baptized me when I was\nan infant. The good old man has been preaching thirty or forty years\non a salary of four hundred dollars, and has had to run a small farm to\nmake both ends meet. He believed in me and gave me good advice. Outside\nof these I don’t remember any one who felt an interest in Jefferson\nPettigrew.”\n\n“You will have the satisfaction of letting them see that they did not do\nyou justice.”\n\n“Yes, but I may not tell them--that is none except my true friends. If\nI did, they would hover round me and want to borrow money, or get me to\ntake them out West with me. So I have hit upon a plan. I shall want to\nuse money, but I will pretend it is yours.”\n\nRodney opened his eyes in surprise.\n\n“I will pass you off as a rich friend from New York, who feels an\ninterest in me and is willing to help me.”\n\nRodney smiled.\n\n“I don’t know if I can look the character,” he said.\n\n“Oh yes you can. You are nicely dressed, while I am hardly any better\ndressed than when I left Burton.”\n\n“I have wondered why you didn’t buy some new clothes when you were able\nto afford it.”\n\n“You see we Western miners don’t care much for style, perhaps not\nenough. Still I probably shall buy a suit or two, but not till I have\nmade my visit home. I want to see how people will receive me, when they\nthink I haven’t got much money. I shall own up to about five hundred\ndollars, but that isn’t enough to dazzle people even in a small country\nvillage.”\n\n“I am wiling to help you in any way you wish, Mr. Pettigrew.”\n\n“Then I think we shall get some amusement out of it. I shall represent\nyou as worth about a hundred thousand dollars.”\n\n“I wish I were.”\n\n“Very likely you will be some time if you go out to Montana with me.”\n\n“How large a place is Burton?”\n\n“It has not quite a thousand inhabitants. It is set among the hills,\nand has but one rich man, Lemuel Sheldon, who is worth perhaps fifty\nthousand dollars, but put on the airs of a millionaire.”\n\n“You are as rich as he, then.”\n\n“Yes, and shall soon be richer. However, I don’t want him to know it. It\nis he who holds the mortgage on my uncle’s farm.”\n\n“Do you know how large the mortgage is?”\n\n“It is twelve hundred dollars. I shall borrow the money of you to pay\nit.”\n\n“I understand,” said Rodney, smiling.\n\n“I shall enjoy the way the old man will look down upon me very much as a\nmillionaire looks down upon a town pauper.”\n\n“How will he look upon me?”\n\n“He will be very polite to you, for he will think you richer than\nhimself.”\n\n“On the whole, we are going to act a comedy, Mr. Pettigrew. What is the\nname of the man who lent you money to go to Montana?”\n\n“A young carpenter, Frank Dobson. He lent me a hundred dollars, which\nwas about all the money he had saved up.”\n\n“He was a true friend.”\n\n“You are right. He was. Everybody told Frank that he would never see his\nmoney again, but he did. As soon as I could get together enough to\nrepay him I sent it on, though I remember it left me with less than ten\ndollars in my pocket.\n\n“I couldn’t bear to think that Frank would lose anything by me. You see\nwe were chums at school and always stood by each other. He is married\nand has two children.”\n\n“While you are an old bachelor.”\n\n“Yes; I ain’t in a hurry to travel in double harness. I’ll wait till\nI am ready to leave Montana, with money enough to live handsomely at\nhome.”\n\n“You have got enough now.”\n\n“But I may as well get more. I am only thirty years old, and I can\nafford to work a few years longer.”\n\n“I wish I could be sure of being worth fifty thousand dollars when I am\nyour age.”\n\n“You have been worth that, you tell me.”\n\n“Yes, but I should value more money that I had made myself.”\n\nAbove five o’clock on Monday afternoon Mr. Pettigrew and Rodney reached\nBurton. It was a small village about four miles from the nearest railway\nstation. An old fashioned Concord stage connected Burton with the\nrailway. The driver was on the platform looking out for passengers when\nJefferson Pettigrew stepped out of the car.\n\n“How are you, Hector?” said the miner, in an off hand way.\n\n“Why, bless my soul if it isn’t Jeff!” exclaimed the driver, who had\nbeen an old schoolmate of Mr. Pettigrew’s.\n\n“I reckon it is,” said the miner, his face lighting up with the\nsatisfaction he felt at seeing a home face.\n\n“Why, you ain’t changed a mite, Jeff. You look just as you did when you\nwent away. How long have you been gone?”\n\n“Four years!”\n\n“Made a fortune? But you don’t look like it. That’s the same suit you\nwore when you went away, isn’t it?”\n\nMr. Pettigrew laughed.\n\n“Well no, it isn’t the same, but it’s one of the same kind.”\n\n“I thought maybe you’d come home in a dress suit.”\n\n“It isn’t so easy to make a fortune, Hector.”\n\n“But you have made something, ain’t you?”\n\n“Oh, yes, when I went away I hadn’t a cent except what I borrowed. Now\nI’ve got five hundred dollars.”\n\n“That ain’t much.”\n\n“No, but it’s better than nothing. How much more have you got, Hector?”\n\n“Well, you see I married last year. I haven’t had a chance to lay by.”\n\n“So you see I did as well as if I had stayed at home.”\n\n“Are you going to stay home now?”\n\n“For a little while. I may go back to Montana after a bit.”\n\n“Is it a good place to make money?”\n\n“I made five hundred dollars.”\n\n“Thats only a little more than a hundred dollars a year. Frank Dobson\nhas saved as much as that and he’s stayed right here in Burton.”\n\n“I’m glad of that,” said Pettigrew heartily. “Frank is a rousing good\nfellow. If it hadn’t been for him I couldn’t have gone to Montana.”\n\n“It doesn’t seem to have done you much good, as I can see.”\n\n“Oh, well, I am satisfied. Let me introduce my friend, Mr. Rodney Ropes\nof New York.”\n\n“Glad to meet you,” said Hector with a jerk of the head.\n\n“Rodney, won’t you sit inside? I want to sit outide with Hector.”\n\n“All right, Mr. Pettigrew.”\n\n“Who is that boy?” asked Hector with characteristic Yankee curiosity, as\nhe seized the lines and started the horses.\n\n“A rich young fellow from New York. I got acquainted with him there.”\n\n“Rich is he?” Jefferson Pettigrew nodded.\n\n“How rich do you think?”\n\n“Shouldn’t wonder if he might be worth a hundred thousand.”\n\n“You don’t say! Why, he beat Squire Sheldon.”\n\n“Oh, yes, Squire Sheldon wouldn’t be considered rich in New York.”\n\n“How did he get his money?”\n\n“His father left him a fortune.”\n\n“Is that so? I wish my father had left me a fortune.”\n\n“He did, didn’t he?”\n\n“Yes, he did! When his estate was settled I got seventy five dollars, if\nyou call that a fortune. But I say, what brings the boy to Burton?”\n\n“His friendship for me, I expect. Besides he may invest in a place.”\n\n“There’s the old Morse place for sale. Do you think he’d buy that?”\n\n“It wouldn’t be nice enough for him. I don’t know any place that would\nbe good enough except the squire’s.”\n\n“The squire wouldn’t sell.”\n\n“Oh, well, I don’t know as Rodney would care to locate in Burton.”\n\n“You’re in luck to get such a friend. Say, do you think he would lend\nyou a hundred dollars if you were hard up?”\n\n“I know he would. By the way, Hector, is there any news? How is my\nuncle?”\n\n“I think the old man is worrying on account of his mortgage.”\n\n“Who holds it?”\n\n“The squire. They do say he is goin’ to foreclose. That’ll be bad for\nthe old man. It’ll nigh about break his heart I expect.”\n\n“Can’t uncle raise the money to pay him?”\n\n“Who is there round here who has got any money except the squire?”\n\n“That’s so.”\n\n“Where are you goin’ to stop, Jeff?”\n\n“I guess I’ll stop at the tavern tonight, but I’ll go over and call on\nuncle this evening.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\nJEFFERSON PETTIGREW’S HOME.\n\n\nNews spreads fast in a country village. Scarcely an hour had passed\nwhen it was generally known that Jefferson Pettigrew had come home from\nMontana with a few hundred dollars in money, bringing with him a rich\nboy who could buy out all Burton. At least that is the way the report\nran.\n\nWhen the two new arrivals had finished supper and come out on the hotel\nveranda there were a dozen of Jefferson Pettigrew’s friends ready to\nwelcome him.\n\n“How are you, Jefferson, old boy?” said one and another.\n\n“Pretty well, thank you. It seems good to be home.”\n\n“I hear you’ve brought back some money.”\n\n“Yes, a few hundred dollars.”\n\n“That’s better than nothing. I reckon you’ll stay home now.”\n\n“I can’t afford it, boys.”\n\n“Are ye goin’ back to Montany?”\n\n“Yes. I know the country, and I can make a middlin’ good livin’ there.”\n\n“I say, is that boy thats with you as rich as they say?”\n\n“I don’t know what they say.”\n\n“They say he’s worth a million.”\n\n“Oh no, not so much as that. He’s pretty well fixed.”\n\n“Hasn’t he got a father livin’?”\n\n“No, it’s his father that left the money.”\n\n“How did you happen to get in with him?”\n\n“Oh, we met promiscuous. He took a sort of fancy to me, and that’s the\nway of it.”\n\n“Do you expect to keep him with you?”\n\n“He talks of goin’ back to Montana with me. I’ll be sort of guardian to\nhim.”\n\n“You’re in luck, Jeff.”\n\n“Yes, I’m in luck to have pleasant company. Maybe we’ll join together\nand buy a mine.”\n\n“Would you mind introducin’ him?”\n\n“Not at all,” and thus Rodney became acquainted with quite a number\nof the Burton young men. He was amused to see with what deference they\ntreated him, but preserved a sober face and treated all cordially, so\nthat he made a favorable impression on those he met.\n\nAmong those who made it in their way to call on the two travelers was\nLemuel Sheldon, the rich man of the village.\n\n“How do you do, Jefferson?” he said condescendingly.\n\n“Very well, sir.”\n\n“You have been quite a traveler.”\n\n“Yes, sir; I have been to the far West.”\n\n“And met with some success, I am told.”\n\n“Yes, sir; I raised money enough to get home.”\n\n“I hear you brought home a few hundred dollars.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Oh, well,” said the squire patronizingly, “that’s good beginning.”\n\n“It must seem very little to a rich man like you, squire.”\n\n“Oh, no!” said the squire patronizingly. “You are a young man. I\nshouldn’t wonder if by the time you get as old as I am you might be\nworth five thousand dollars.”\n\n“I hope so,” answered Mr. Pettigrew demurely.\n\n“By the way, you have brought a young man with you, I am told.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I should like to make his acquaintance. He is rich, is he not?”\n\n“I wish I was as rich.”\n\n“You don’t say so! About how much do you estimate he is worth?”\n\n“I don’t think it amounts to quite as much as a quarter of a million.\nStill, you know it is not always easy to tell how much a person is\nworth.”\n\n“He is certainly a VERY fortunate young man,” said the squire,\nimpressed. “What is his name?”\n\n“Rodney Ropes.”\n\n“The name sounds aristocratic. I shall be glad to know him.”\n\n“Rodney,” said Mr. Pettigrew. “I want to introduce you to Squire\nSheldon, our richest and most prominent citizen.”\n\n“I am glad to meet you, Squire Sheldon,” said Rodney, offering his hand.\n\n“I quite reciprocate the feeling, Mr. Ropes, but Mr. Pettigrew should\nnot call me a rich man. I am worth something, to be sure.”\n\n“I should say you were, squire,” said Jefferson. “Rodney, he is as rich\nas you are.”\n\n“Oh no,” returned the squire, modestly, “not as rich as that. Indeed, I\nhardly know how much I am worth. As Mr. Pettigrew very justly observed\nit is not easy to gauge a man’s possessions. But there is one difference\nbetween us. You, Mr. Ropes, I take it, are not over eighteen.”\n\n“Only sixteen, sir.”\n\n“And yet you are wealthy. I am rising fifty. When you come to my age you\nwill be worth much more.”\n\n“Perhaps I may have lost all I now possess,” said Rodney. “Within a year\nI have lost fifty thousand dollars.”\n\n“You don’t say so.”\n\n“Yes; it was through a man who had charge of my property. I think now I\nshall manage my money matters myself.”\n\n“Doubtless you are right. That was certainly a heavy loss. I shouldn’t\nlike to lose so much. I suppose, however, you had something left?”\n\n“Oh yes,” answered Rodney in an indifferent tone.\n\n“He must be rich to make so little account of fifty thousand dollars,”\n thought the squire.\n\n“How long do you propose to stay in town, Mr. Pettigrew?” he asked.\n\n“I can’t tell, sir, but I don’t think I can spare more than three or\nfour days.”\n\n“May I hope that you and Mr. Ropes will take supper with me tomorrow\nevening?”\n\n“Say the next day and we’ll come. Tomorrow I must go to my uncle’s.”\n\n“Oh very well!”\n\nSquire Sheldon privately resolved to pump Rodney as to the investment of\nhis property. He was curious to learn first how much the boy was worth,\nfor if there was anything that the squire worshiped it was wealth. He\nwas glad to find that Mr. Pettigrew had only brought home five hundred\ndollars, as it was not enough to lift the mortgage on his uncle’s farm.\n\nAfter they were left alone Jefferson Pettigrew turned to Rodney and\nsaid, “Do you mind my leaving you a short time and calling at my\nuncle’s?”\n\n“Not at all, Mr. Pettigrew. I can pass my time very well.”\n\nJefferson Pettigrew directed his steps to an old fashioned farmhouse\nabout half a mile from the village. In the rear the roof sloped down so\nthat the eaves were only five feet from the ground. The house was large\nthough the rooms were few in number.\n\nIn the sitting room sat an old man and his wife, who was nearly as\nold. It was not a picture of cheerful old age, for each looked sad.\nThe sadness of old age is pathetic for there is an absence of hope,\nand courage, such as younger people are apt to feel even when they are\nweighed down by trouble.\n\nCyrus Hooper was seventy one, his wife two years younger. During the\ngreater part of their lives they had been well to do, if not prosperous,\nbut now their money was gone, and there was a mortgage on the old home\nwhich they could not pay.\n\n“I don’t know whats goin’ to become of us, Nancy,” said Cyrus Hooper.\n“We’ll have to leave the old home, and when the farm’s been sold there\nwon’t be much left over and above the mortgage which Louis Sheldon\nholds.”\n\n“Don’t you think the squire will give you a little more time, Cyrus?”\n\n“No; I saw him yesterday, and he’s sot on buyin’ in the farm for\nhimself. He reckons it won’t fetch more’n eighteen hundred dollars.”\n\n“Thats only six hundred over the mortgage.”\n\n“It isn’t that Nancy. There’s about a hundred dollars due in interest.\nWe won’t get more’n five hundred dollars.”\n\n“Surely, Cyrus, the farm is worth three thousand dollars.”\n\n“So it is, Nancy, but that won’t do us any good, as long as no one wants\nit more’n the squire.”\n\n“I wish Jefferson were at home.”\n\n“What good would it do? I surmise he hasn’t made any money. He never did\nhave much enterprise, that boy.”\n\n“He was allus a good boy, Cyrus.”\n\n“That’s so, Nancy, but he didn’t seem cut out for makin’ money. Still\nit would do me good to see him. Maybe we might have a home together, and\nmanage to live.”\n\nJust then a neighbor entered.\n\n“Have you heard the news?” she asked.\n\n“No; what is it?”\n\n“Your nephew Jefferson Pettigrew has got back.”\n\n“You don’t mean so. There, Jefferson, that’s one comfort.”\n\n“And they say he has brought home five hundred dollars.”\n\n“That’s more’n I thought he’d bring. Where is he?”\n\n“Over at the tavern. He’s brought a young man with him, leastways a boy,\nthat’s got a lot of money.”\n\n“The boy?”\n\n“Yes; he’s from New York, and is a friend of Jefferson’s.”\n\n“Well, I’m glad he’s back. Why didn’t he come here?”\n\n“It’s likely he would if the boy wasn’t with him.”\n\n“Perhaps he heard of my misfortune.”\n\n“I hope it’ll all come right, Mr. Hooper. My, if there ain’t Jefferson\ncomin’ to see you now. I see him through the winder. I guess I’ll be\ngoin’. You’ll want to see him alone.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n\nTHE BOY CAPITALIST.\n\n\n“How are you, Uncle Cyrus?” said Jefferson Pettigrew heartily, as he\nclasped his uncle’s toil worn hand. “And Aunt Nancy, too! It pays me for\ncoming all the way from Montana just to see you.”\n\n“I’m glad to see you, Jefferson,” said his uncle. “It seems a long time\nsince you went away. I hope you’ve prospered.”\n\n“Well, uncle, I’ve brought myself back well and hearty, and I’ve got a\nfew hundred dollars.”\n\n“I’m glad to hear it, Jefferson. You’re better off than when you went\naway.”\n\n“Yes, uncle. I couldn’t be much worse off. Then I hadn’t a cent that I\ncould call my own. But how are you and Aunt Nancy?”\n\n“We’re gettin’ old, Jefferson, and misfortune has come to us. Squire\nSheldon has got a mortgage on the farm and it’s likely we’ll be turned\nout. You’ve come just in time to see it.”\n\n“Is it so bad as that, Uncle Cyrus? Why, when I went away you were\nprosperous.”\n\n“Yes, Jefferson, I owned the farm clear, and I had money in the bank,\nbut now the money’s gone and there’s a twelve hundred dollar mortgage on\nthe old place,” and the old man sighed.\n\n“But how did it come about uncle? You and Aunt Nancy haven’t lived\nextravagantly, have you? Aunt Nancy, you haven’t run up a big bill at\nthe milliner’s and dressmaker’s?”\n\n“You was always for jokin’, Jefferson,” said the old lady, smiling\nfaintly; “but that is not the way our losses came.”\n\n“How then?”\n\n“You see I indorsed notes for Sam Sherman over at Canton, and he failed,\nand I had to pay, then I bought some wild cat minin’ stock on Sam’s\nrecommendation, and that went down to nothin’. So between the two I lost\nabout three thousand dollars. I’ve been a fool, Jefferson, and it would\nhave been money in my pocket if I’d had a guardeen.”\n\n“So you mortgaged the place to Squire Sheldon, uncle?”\n\n“Yes; I had to. I was obliged to meet my notes.”\n\n“But surely the squire will extend the mortgage.”\n\n“No, he won’t. I’ve asked him. He says he must call in the money, and so\nthe old place will have to be sold, and Nancy and I must turn out in our\nold age.”\n\nAgain the old man sighed, and tears came into Nancy Hooper’s eyes.\n\n“There’ll be something left, won’t there, Uncle Cyrus?”\n\n“Yes, the place should bring six hundred dollars over and above the\nmortgage. That’s little enough, for it’s worth three thousand.”\n\n“So it is, Uncle Cyrus. But what can you do with six hundred dollars? It\nwon’t support you and Aunt Nancy?”\n\n“I thought mebbe, Jefferson, I could hire a small house and you could\nboard with us, so that we could still have a home together.”\n\n“I’ll think it over, uncle, if there is no other way. But are you sure\nSquire Sheldon won’t give you more time?”\n\n“No, Jefferson. I surmise he wants the place himself. There’s talk of a\nrailroad from Sherborn, and that’ll raise the price of land right around\nhere. It’ll probably go right through the farm just south of the three\nacre lot.”\n\n“I see, Uncle Cyrus. You ought to have the benefit of the rise in\nvalue.”\n\n“Yes, Jefferson, it would probably rise enough to pay off the mortgage,\nbut its no use thinkin’ of it. The old farm has got to go.”\n\n“I don’t know about that, Uncle Cyrus.”\n\n“Why, Jefferson, you haven’t money enough to lift the mortgage!” said\nthe old man, with faint hope.\n\n“If I haven’t I may get it for you. Tell me just how much money is\nrequired.”\n\n“Thirteen hundred dollars, includin’ interest.”\n\n“Perhaps you have heard that I have a boy with me--a boy from New York,\nnamed Rodney Ropes. He has money, and perhaps I might get him to advance\nthe sum you want.”\n\n“Oh, Jefferson, if you only could!” exclaimed Aunt Nancy, clasping her\nthin hands. “It would make us very happy.”\n\n“I’ll see Rodney tonight and come over tomorrow morning and tell you\nwhat he says. On account of the railroad I shall tell him that it is a\ngood investment. I suppose you will be willing to mortgage the farm to\nhim for the same money that he pays to lift the present mortgage?”\n\n“Yes, Jefferson, I’ll be willin’ and glad. It’ll lift a great burden\nfrom my shoulders. I’ve been worryin’ at the sorrow I’ve brought upon\npoor Nancy, for she had nothing to do with my foolish actions. I was old\nenough to know better, Jefferson, and I’m ashamed of what I did.”\n\n“Well, Uncle Cyrus, I’ll do what I can for you. Now let us forget all\nabout your troubles and talk over the village news. You know I’ve been\naway for four years, and I haven’t had any stiddy correspondence, so a\ngood deal must have happened that I don’t know anything about. I hear\nFrank Dobson has prospered?”\n\n“Yes, Frank’s pretty forehanded. He’s got a good economical wife, and\nthey’ve laid away five or six hundred dollars in the savings bank.”\n\n“I am glad of it. Frank is a good fellow. If it hadn’t been for him I\ncouldn’t have gone to Montana. When he lent me the money everybody said\nhe’d lose it, but I was bound to pay it if I had to live on one meal a\nday. He was the only man in town who believed in me at that time.”\n\n“You was a littless shif’less, Jefferson. You can’t blame people. I\nwasn’t quite sure myself how you’d get along.”\n\n“No doubt you are right, Uncle Cyrus. It did me good to leave town. I\ndidn’t drink, but I had no ambition. When a man goes to a new country\nit’s apt to make a new man of him. That was the case with me.”\n\n“Are you goin’ back again, Jefferson?”\n\n“Yes, uncle. I’m going to stay round here long enough to fix up your\naffairs and get you out of your trouble. Then I’ll go back to the West.\nI have a little mining interest there and I can make more money there\nthan I can here.”\n\n“If you can get me out of my trouble, Jefferson, I’ll never forget it.\nNancy and I have been so worried that we couldn’t sleep nights, but now\nI’m beginnin’ to be a little more cheerful.”\n\nJefferson Pettigrew spent another hour at his uncle’s house, and then\nwent back to the tavern, where he found Rodney waiting for him. He\nexplained briefly the part he wished his boy friend to take in his plan\nfor relieving his uncle.\n\n“I shall be receiving credit to which I am not entitled,” said Rodney.\n“Still, if it will oblige you I am willing to play the part of the boy\ncapitalist.”\n\nThe next morning after breakfast the two friends walked over to the\nhouse of Cyrus Hooper. Aunt Nancy came to the door and gave them a\ncordial welcome.\n\n“Cyrus is over at the barn, Jefferson,” she said. “I’ll ring the bell\nand he’ll come in.”\n\n“No, Aunt Nancy, I’ll go out and let him know I am here.”\n\nPresently Cyrus Hooper came in, accompanied by Jefferson.\n\n“Uncle Cyrus,” said the miner, “let me introduce you to my friend Rodney\nRopes, of New York.”\n\n“I’m glad to see you,” said Cyrus heartily. “I’m glad to see any friend\nof Jefferson’s.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. I am pleased to meet you.”\n\n“Jefferson says you are goin’ to Montany with him.”\n\n“I hope to do so. I am sure I shall enjoy myself in his company.”\n\n“How far is Montany, Jefferson?”\n\n“It is over two thousand miles away, Uncle Cyrus.”\n\n“It must be almost at the end of the world. I don’t see how you can feel\nat home so far away from Vermont.”\n\nJefferson smiled.\n\n“I can content myself wherever I can make a good living,” he said.\n“Wouldn’t you like to go out and make me a visit?”\n\n“No, Jefferson, I should feel that it was temptin’ Providence to go so\nfar at my age.”\n\n“You never were very far from Burton, Uncle Cyrus?”\n\n“I went to Montpelier once,” answered the old man with evident pride.\n“It is a nice sizable place. I stopped at the tavern, and had a good\ntime.”\n\nIt was the only journey the old man had ever made, and he would never\nforget it.\n\n“Uncle Cyrus,” said Jefferson, “this is the young man who I thought\nmight advance you money on a new mortgage. Suppose we invite him to go\nover the farm, and take a look at it so as to see what he thinks of the\ninvestment.”\n\n“Sartain, Jefferson, sartain! I do hope Mr. Ropes you’ll look favorable\non the investment. It is Jefferson’s idea, but it would be doin’ me a\ngreat favor.”\n\n“Mr. Pettigrew will explain the advantages of the farm as we go along,”\n said Rodney.\n\nSo they walked from field to field, Jefferson expatiating to his young\nfriend upon the merits of the investment, Rodney asking questions now\nand then to carry out his part of the shrewd and careful boy capitalist.\n\nWhen they had made a tour of the farm Jefferson said: “Well, Rodney,\nwhat do you think of the investment?”\n\n“I am satisfied with it,” answered Rodney. “Mr. Hooper, I will advance\nyou the money on the conditions mentioned by my friend, Mr. Pettigrew.”\n\nTears of joy came into the eyes of Cyrus Hooper and his worn face showed\nrelief.\n\n“I am very grateful, young man,” he said. “I will see that you don’t\nregret your kindness.”\n\n“When will Squire Sheldon be over to settle matters, Uncle Cyrus?” asked\nJefferson.\n\n“He is comin’ this afternoon at two o’clock.”\n\n“Then Rodney and I will be over to take part in the business.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\n\nTHE FAILURE OF SQUIRE SHELDON’S PLOT.\n\n\nOn the morning of the same day Squire Sheldon sat in his study when the\nservant came in and brought a card.\n\n“It’s a gentleman thats come to see you, sir,” she said.\n\nLemuel Sheldon’s eye brightened when he saw the name, for it was that of\na railroad man who was interested in the proposed road from Sherborn.\n\n“I am glad to see you, Mr. Caldwell,” he said cordially, rising to\nreceive his guest. “What is the prospect as regards the railroad?”\n\n“I look upon it as a certainty,” answered Enoch Caldwell, a grave,\nportly man of fifty.\n\n“And it is sure to pass through our town?”\n\n“Yes, I look upon that as definitely decided.”\n\n“The next question is as to the route it will take,” went on the squire.\n“Upon that point I should like to offer a few suggestions.”\n\n“I shall be glad to receive them. In fact, I may say that my report will\nprobably be accepted, and I shall be glad to consult you.”\n\n“Thank you. I appreciate the compliment you pay me, and, though I say\nit, I don’t think you could find any one more thoroughly conversant with\nthe lay of the land and the most advisable route to follow. If you will\nput on your hat we will go out together and I will give you my views.”\n\n“I shall be glad to do so.”\n\nThe two gentlemen took a leisurely walk through the village, going by\nCyrus Hooper’s house on the way.\n\n“In my view,” said the squire, “the road should go directly through this\nfarm a little to the north of the house.”\n\nThe squire proceeded to explain his reasons for the route he\nrecommended.\n\n“To whom does the farm belong?” asked Caldwell, with a shrewd glance at\nthe squire.\n\n“To an old man named Cyrus Hooper.”\n\n“Ahem! Perhaps he would be opposed to the road passing so near his\nhouse.”\n\n“I apprehend that he will not have to be consulted,” said the squire\nwith a crafty smile.\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“Because I hold a mortgage on the farm which I propose to foreclose this\nafternoon.”\n\n“I see. So that you will be considerably benefited by the road.”\n\n“Yes, to a moderate extent.”\n\n“But if a different course should be selected, how then?”\n\n“If the road goes through the farm I would be willing to give a quarter\nof the damages awarded to me to--you understand?”\n\n“I think I do. After all it seems the most natural route.”\n\n“I think there can be no doubt on that point. Of course the corporation\nwill be willing to pay a reasonable sum for land taken.”\n\n“I think I can promise that, as I shall have an important voice in the\nmatter.”\n\n“I see you are a thorough business man,” said the squire. “I hold that\nit is always best to pursue a liberal policy.”\n\n“Quite so. You have no doubt of obtaining the farm?”\n\n“Not the slightest.”\n\n“But suppose the present owner meets the mortgage?”\n\n“He can’t. He is a poor man, and he has no moneyed friends. I confess\nI was a little afraid that a nephew of his just returned from Montana\nmight be able to help him, but I learn that he has only brought home\nfive hundred dollars while the mortgage, including interest, calls for\nthirteen hundred.”\n\n“Then you appear to be safe. When did you say the matter would be\nsettled?”\n\n“This afternoon at two o’clock. You had better stay over and take supper\nwith me. I shall be prepared to talk with you at that time.”\n\n“Very well.”\n\nFrom a window of the farmhouse Cyrus Hooper saw Squire Sheldon and his\nguest walking by the farm, and noticed the interest which they seemed to\nfeel in it. But for the assurance which he had received of help to pay\nthe mortgage he would have felt despondent, for he guessed the subject\nof their conversation. As it was, he felt an excusable satisfaction in\nthe certain defeat of the squire’s hopes of gain.\n\n“It seems that the more a man has the more he wants, Jefferson,” he said\nto his nephew. “The squire is a rich man--the richest man in Burton--but\nhe wants to take from me the little property that I have.”\n\n“It’s the way of the world, Uncle Cyrus. In this case the squire is safe\nto be disappointed, thanks to my young friend, Rodney.”\n\n“Its lucky for me, Jefferson, that you came home just the time you did.\nIf you had come a week later it would have been too late.”\n\n“Then you don’t think the squire would have relented?”\n\n“I know he wouldn’t. I went over a short time since and had a talk with\nhim on the subject. I found he was sot on gettin’ the farm into his own\nhands.”\n\n“If he were willing to pay a fair value it wouldn’t be so bad.”\n\n“He wasn’t. He wanted to get it as cheap as he could.”\n\n“I wonder,” said Jefferson Pettigrew reflectively, “whether I shall be\nas hard and selfish if ever I get rich.”\n\n“I don’t believe you will, Jefferson. I don’t believe you will. It\ndoesn’t run in the blood.”\n\n“I hope not Uncle Cyrus. How long have you known the squire?”\n\n“Forty years, Jefferson. He is about ten years younger than I am. I was\na young man when he was a boy.”\n\n“And you attend the same church?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And still he is willing to take advantage of you and reduce you to\npoverty. I don’t see much religion in that.”\n\n“When a man’s interest is concerned religion has to stand to one side\nwith some people.”\n\nIt was in a pleasant frame of mind that Squire Sheldon left his house\nand walked over to the farmhouse which he hoped to own. He had decided\nto offer eighteen hundred dollars for the farm, which would be five\nhundred over and above the face of the mortgage with the interest added.\n\nThis of itelf would give him an excellent profit, but he expected also,\nas we know, to drive a stiff bargain with the new railroad company, for\nsuch land as they would require to use.\n\n“Stay here till I come back, Mr. Caldwell,” he said. “I apprehend it\nwon’t take me long to get through my business.”\n\nSquire Sheldon knocked at the door of the farmhouse, which was opened to\nhim by Nancy Hooper.\n\n“Walk in, squire,” she said.\n\n“Is your husband at home, Mrs. Hooper?”\n\n“Yes; he is waiting for you.”\n\nMrs. Hooper led the way into the sitting room, where her husband was\nsitting in a rocking chair.\n\n“Good afternoon, Mr. Hooper,” said the squire. “I hope I see you well.”\n\n“As well as I expect to be. I’m gettin’ to be an old man.”\n\n“We must all grow old,” said the squire vaguely.\n\n“And sometimes a man’s latter years are his most sorrowful years.”\n\n“That means that he can’t pay the mortgage,” thought Squire Sheldon.\n\n“Well, ahem! Yes, it does sometimes happen so,” he said aloud.\n\n“Still if a man’s friends stand by him, that brings him some comfort.”\n\n“I suppose you know what I’ve come about, Mr. Hooper,” said the squire,\nanxious to bring his business to a conclusion.\n\n“I suppose it’s about the mortgage.”\n\n“Yes, its about the mortgage.”\n\n“Will you be willing to extend it another year?”\n\n“I thought,” said the squire, frowning, “I had given you to understand\nthat I cannot do this. You owe me a large sum in accrued interest.”\n\n“But if I make shift to pay this?”\n\n“I should say the same. It may as well come first as last. You can’t\nhold the place, and there is no chance of your being better off by\nwaiting.”\n\n“I understand that the new railroad might go through my farm. That would\nput me on my feet.”\n\n“There is no certainty that the road will ever be built. Even if it\nwere, it would not be likely to cross your farm.”\n\n“I see, Squire Sheldon, you are bound to have the place.”\n\n“There is no need to put it that way, Mr. Hooper. I lent you money\non mortgage. You can’t pay the mortgage, and of course I foreclose.\nHowever, I will buy the farm and allow you eighteen hundred dollars for\nit. That will give you five hundred dollars over and above the money you\nowe me.”\n\n“The farm is worth three thousand dollars.”\n\n“Nonsense, Mr. Hooper. Still if you get an offer of that sum TODAY I\nwill advise you to sell.”\n\n“I certainly won’t take eighteen hundred.”\n\n“You won’t? Then I shall foreclose, and you may have to take less.”\n\n“Then there is only one thing to do.”\n\n“As you say, there is only one thing to do.”\n\n“And that is, to pay off the mortgage and clear the farm.”\n\n“You can’t do it!” exclaimed the squire uneasily.\n\nCyrus Hooper’s only answer was to call “Jefferson.”\n\nJefferson Pettigrew entered the room, followed by Rodney.\n\n“What does this mean?” asked the squire.\n\n“It means, Squire Sheldon,” said Mr. Pettigrew, “that you won’t turn\nmy uncle out of his farm this time. My young friend, Rodney Ropes, has\nadvanced Uncle Cyrus money enough to pay off the mortgage.”\n\n“I won’t take a check,” said the squire hastily.\n\n“You would have to if we insisted upon it, but I have the money here in\nbills. Give me a release and surrender the mortgage, and you shall have\nyour money.”\n\nIt was with a crestfallen look that Squire Sheldon left the farmhouse,\nthough his pockets were full of money.\n\n“It’s all up,” he said to his friend Caldwell in a hollow voice. “They\nhave paid the mortgage.”\n\nAfter all the railway did cross the farm, and Uncle Cyrus was paid two\nthousand dollars for the right of way, much to the disappointment of\nhis disinterested friend Lemuel Sheldon, who felt that this sum ought to\nhave gone into his own pocket.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\n\nA MINISTER’S GOOD FORTUNE.\n\n\n“I have another call to make, Rodney,” said Mr. Pettigrew, as they were\non their way back to the hotel, “and I want you to go with me.”\n\n“I shall be glad to accompany you anywhere, Mr. Pettigrew.”\n\n“You remember I told you of the old minister whose church I attended as\na boy. He has never received but four hundred dollars a year, yet he\nhas managed to rear a family, but has been obliged to use the strictest\neconomy.”\n\n“Yes, I remember.”\n\n“I am going to call on him, and I shall take the opportunity to make\nhim a handsome present. It will surprise him, and I think it will be the\nfirst present of any size that he has received in his pastorate of over\nforty years.\n\n“There he lives!” continued Jefferson, pointing out a very modest\ncottage on the left hand side of the road.\n\nIt needed painting badly, but it looked quite as well as the minister\nwho came to the door in a ragged dressing gown. He was venerable\nlooking, for his hair was quite white, though he was only sixty five\nyears old. But worldly cares which had come upon him from the difficulty\nof getting along on his scanty salary had whitened his hair and deepened\nthe wrinkles on his kindly face.\n\n“I am glad to see you, Jefferson,” he said, his face lighting up with\npleasure. “I heard you were in town and I hoped you wouldn’t fail to\ncall upon me.”\n\n“I was sure to call, for you were always a good friend to me as well as\nmany others.”\n\n“I always looked upon you as one of my boys, Jefferson. I hear that you\nhave been doing well.”\n\n“Yes, Mr. Canfield. I have done better than I have let people know.”\n\n“Have you been to see your uncle? Poor man, he is in trouble.”\n\n“He is no longer in trouble. The mortgage is paid off, and as far as\nSquire Sheldon is concerned he is independent.”\n\n“Indeed, that is good news,” said the old minister with beaming face.\n“You must surely have done well if you could furnish money enough to\nclear the farm. It was over a thousand dollars, wasn’t it?”\n\n“Yes, thirteen hundred. My young friend, Rodney Ropes, and myself\nmanaged it between us.”\n\n“I am glad to see you, Mr. Ropes. Come in both of you. Mrs. Canfield\nwill be glad to welcome you.”\n\nThey followed him into the sitting room, the floor of which was\ncovered by an old and faded carpet. The furniture was of the plainest\ndescription. But it looked pleasant and homelike, and the papers and\nbooks that were scattered about made it more attractive to a visitor\nthan many showy city drawing rooms.\n\n“And how are all your children, Mr. Canfield?” asked Jefferson.\n\n“Maria is married to a worthy young man in the next town. Benjamin is\nemployed in a book store, and Austin wants to go to college, but I don’t\nsee any way to send him, poor boy!” and the minister sighed softly.\n\n“Does it cost much to keep a boy in college?”\n\n“Not so much as might be supposed. There are beneficiary funds for\ndeserving students, and then there is teaching to eke out a poor young\nman’s income, so that I don’t think it would cost over a hundred and\nfifty dollars a year.”\n\n“That isn’t a large sum.”\n\n“Not in itelf, but you know, Jefferson, my salary is only four hundred\ndollars a year. It would take nearly half my income, so I think Austin\nwill have to give up his hopes of going to college and follow in his\nbrother’s steps.”\n\n“How old is Austin now?”\n\n“He is eighteen.”\n\n“Is he ready for college?”\n\n“Yes, he could enter at the next commencement but for the financial\nproblem.”\n\n“I never had any taste for college, or study, as you know, Mr. Canfield.\nIt is different with my friend Rodney, who is a Latin and Greek\nscholar.”\n\nThe minister regarded Rodney with new interest.\n\n“Do you think of going to college, Mr. Ropes?” he asked.\n\n“Not at present. I am going back to Montana with Mr. Pettigrew. Perhaps\nhe and I will both go to college next year.”\n\n“Excuse me,” said Jefferson Pettigrew. “Latin and Greek ain’t in my\nline. I should make a good deal better miner than minister.”\n\n“It is not desirable that all should become ministers or go to college,”\n said Mr. Canfield. “I suspect from what I know of you, Jefferson, that\nyou judge yourself correctly. How long shall you stay in Burton?”\n\n“I expect to go away tomorrow.”\n\n“Your visit is a brief one.”\n\n“Yes, I intended to stay longer, but I begin to be homesick after the\nWest.”\n\n“Do you expect to make your permanent home there?”\n\n“I can’t tell as to that. For the present I can do better there than\nhere.”\n\nThe conversation lasted for some time. Then Jefferson Pettigrew rose to\ngo.\n\n“Won’t you call again, Jefferson?” asked the minister hospitably.\n\n“I shall not have time, but before I go I want to make you a small\npresent,” and he put into the hands of the astonished minister four fifty\ndollar bills.\n\n“Two hundred dollars!” ejaculated the minister. “Why, I heard you only\nbrought home a few hundred.”\n\n“I prefer to leave that impression. To you I will say that I am worth a\ngreat deal more than that.”\n\n“But you mustn’t give me so much. I am sure you are too generous for\nyour own interest. Why, it’s munificent, princely.”\n\n“Don’t be troubled about me. I can spare it. Send your boy to college,\nand next year I will send you another sum equally large.”\n\n“How can I thank you, Jefferson?” said Mr. Canfield, the tears coming\ninto his eyes. “Never in forty years have I had such a gift.”\n\n“Not even from Squire Sheldon?”\n\n“The squire is not in the habit of bestowing gifts, but he pays a large\nparish tax. May I--am I at liberty to say from whom I received this\nliberal donation?”\n\n“Please don’t! You can say that you have had a gift from a friend.”\n\n“You have made me very happy, Jefferson. Your own conscience will reward\nyou.”\n\nJefferson Pettigrew changed the subject, for it embarrassed him to be\nthanked.\n\n“That pays me for hard work and privation,” he said to Rodney as they\nwalked back to the tavern. “After all there is a great pleasure in\nmaking others happy.”\n\n“Squire Sheldon hadn’t found that out.”\n\n“And he never will.”\n\nOn the way they met the gentleman of whom they had been speaking. He\nbowed stiffly, for he could not feel cordial to those whom had snatched\nfrom him the house for which he had been scheming so long.\n\n“Squire Sheldon,” said Jefferson, “you were kind enough to invite\nRodney and myself to supper some evening. I am sorry to say that we must\ndecline, as we leave Burton tomorrow.”\n\n“Use your own pleasure, Mr. Pettigrew,” said the squire coldly.\n\n“It doesn’t seem to disappoint the squire very much,” remarked\nJefferson, laughing, when the great man of the village had passed on.\n\n“It certainly is no disappointment to me.”\n\n“Nor to me. The little time I have left I can use more pleasantly than\nin going to see the squire. I have promised to supper at my uncle’s\ntonight--that is, I have promised for both of us.”\n\nReturning to New York, Jefferson and Rodney set about getting ready for\ntheir Western journey. Rodney gave some of his wardrobe to Mike Flynn,\nand bought some plain suits suitable for his new home.\n\nWhile walking on Broadway the day before the one fixed for his departure\nhe fell in with Jasper Redwood.\n\n“Have you got a place yet Ropes?” asked Jasper.\n\n“I am not looking for any.”\n\n“How is that?” asked Jasper in some surprise.\n\n“I am going to leave the city.”\n\n“That is a good idea. All cannot succeed in the city. You may find a\nchance to work on a farm in the country.”\n\n“I didn’t say I was going to the country.”\n\n“Where are you going, then?”\n\n“To Montana.”\n\n“Isn’t that a good way off?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What are you going to do there?”\n\n“I may go to mining.”\n\n“But how can you afford to go so far?”\n\n“Really, Jasper, you show considerable curiosity about my affairs. I\nhave money enough to buy my ticket, and I think I can find work when I\nget out there.”\n\n“It seems to me a crazy idea.”\n\n“It might be--for you.”\n\n“And why for me?” asked Jasper suspiciously.\n\n“Because you might not be willing to rough it as I am prepared to do.”\n\n“I guess you are right. I have always been used to living like a\ngentleman.”\n\n“I hope you will always be able to do so. Now I must bid you good by, as\nI am busy getting ready for my journey.”\n\nJasper looked after Rodney, not without perplexity.\n\n“I can’t make out that boy,” he said. “So he is going to be a common\nminer! Well, that may suit him, but it wouldn’t suit me. There is no\nchance now of his interfering with me, so I am glad he is going to leave\nthe city.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\n\nA MINING TOWN IN MONTANA.\n\n\nThe scene changes.\n\nThree weeks later among the miners who were sitting on the narrow\nveranda of the “Miners’ Rest” in Oreville in Montana we recognize two\nfamiliar faces and figures--those of Jefferson Pettigrew and Rodney\nRopes. Both were roughly clad, and if Jasper could have seen Rodney he\nwould have turned up his nose in scorn, for Rodney had all the look of a\ncommon miner.\n\nIt was in Oreville that Mr. Pettigrew had a valuable mining property, on\nwhich he employed quite a number of men who preferred certain wages to a\ncompensation depending on the fluctuations of fortune. Rodney was among\nthose employed, but although he was well paid he could not get to like\nthe work. Of this, however, he said nothing to Mr. Pettigrew whose\ncompany he enjoyed, and whom he held in high esteem.\n\nOn the evening in question Jefferson rose from his seat and signed to\nRodney to follow him.\n\n“Well, Rodney, how do you like Montana?” he asked.\n\n“Well enough to be glad I came here,” answered Rodney.\n\n“Still you are not partial to the work of a miner!”\n\n“I can think of other things I would prefer to do.”\n\n“How would you like keeping a hotel?”\n\n“Is there any hotel in search of a manager?” asked Rodney smiling.\n\n“I will explain. Yesterday I bought the ‘Miners’ Rest.’”\n\n“What--the hotel where we board?”\n\n“Exactly. I found that Mr. Bailey, who has made a comfortable sum of\nmoney, wants to leave Montana and go East and I bought the hotel.”\n\n“So that hereafter I shall board with you?”\n\n“Not exactly. I propose to put you in charge, and pay you a salary. I\ncan oversee, and give you instructions. How will that suit you?”\n\n“So you think I am competent, Mr. Pettigrew?”\n\n“Yes, I think so. There is a good man cook, and two waiters. The cook\nwill also order supplies and act as steward under you.”\n\n“What then will be my duties?”\n\n“You will act as clerk and cashier, and pay the bills. You will have to\nlook after all the details of management. If there is anything you don’t\nunderstand you will have me to back you up, and advise you. What do you\nsay?”\n\n“That I shall like it much better than mining. My only doubt is as to\nwhether I shall suit you.”\n\n“It is true that it takes a smart man to run a hotel, but I think we can\ndo it between us. Now what will you consider a fair salary?”\n\n“I leave that to you, Mr. Pettigrew.”\n\n“Then we will call it a hundred and fifty dollars a month and board.”\n\n“But, Mr. Pettigrew,” said Rodney in surprise, “how can I possibly earn\nthat much?”\n\n“You know we charge big prices, and have about fifty steady boarders.\nI expect to make considerable money after deducting all the expenses of\nmanagement.”\n\n“My friend Jasper would be very much surprised if he could know the\nsalary I am to receive. In the store I was only paid seven dollars a\nweek.”\n\n“The duties were different. Almost any boy could discharge the duties of\nan entry clerk while it takes peculiar qualities to run a hotel.”\n\n“I was certainly very fortunate to fall in with you, Mr. Pettigrew.”\n\n“I expect it will turn out fortunate for me too, Rodney.”\n\n“When do you want me to start in?”\n\n“Next Monday morning. It is now Thursday evening. Mr. Bailey will turn\nover the hotel to me on Saturday night. You needn’t go to the mines\ntomorrow, but may remain in the hotel, and he will instruct you in the\ndetails of management.”\n\n“That will be quite a help to me, and I am at present quite ignorant on\nthe subject.”\n\nRodney looked forward with pleasure to his new employment. He had good\nexecutive talent, though thus far he had had no occasion to exercise it.\nIt was with unusual interest that he set about qualifying himself for\nhis new position.\n\n“Young man,” said the veteran landlord, “I think you’ll do. I thought\nat first that Jefferson was foolish to put a young boy in my place, but\nyou’ve got a head on your shoulders, you have! I guess you’ll fill the\nbill.”\n\n“I hope to do so, Mr. Bailey.”\n\n“Jefferson tells me that you understand Latin and Greek?”\n\n“I know something of them.”\n\n“Thats what prejudiced me against you. I hired a college boy once as a\nclerk and he was the worst failure I ever came across. He seemed to have\nall kinds of sense except common sense. I reckon he was a smart scholar,\nand he could have made out the bills for the boarders in Latin or Greek\nif it had been necessary, but he was that soft that any one could cheat\nhim. Things got so mixed up in the department that I had to turn him\nadrift in a couple of weeks. I surmised you might be the same sort of a\nchap. If you were it would be a bad lookout for Jefferson.”\n\nIn Oreville Mr. Pettigrew was so well known that nearly everyone called\nhim by his first name. Mr. Pettigrew did not care about this as he had\nno false pride or artificial dignity.\n\n“Do you consider this hotel a good property, Mr. Bailey?”\n\n“I’ll tell you this much. I started here four years ago, and I’ve\nmade fifty thousand dollars which I shall take back with me to New\nHampshire.”\n\n“That certainly is satisfactory.”\n\n“I shouldn’t wonder if you could improve upon it.”\n\n“How does it happen that you sell out such a valuable property, Mr.\nBailey? Are you tired of making money?”\n\n“No, but I must tell you that there’s a girl waiting for me at home, an\nold schoolmate, who will become Mrs. Bailey as soon as possible after\nI get back. If she would come out here I wouldn’t sell, but she has a\nmother that she wouldn’t leave, and so I must go to her.”\n\n“That is a good reason, Mr. Bailey.”\n\n“Besides with fifty thousand dollars I can live as well as I want to\nin New Hampshire, and hold up my head with the best. You will follow my\nexample some day.”\n\n“It will be a long day first, Mr. Bailey, for I am only sixteen.”\n\nOn Monday morning the old landlord started for his Eastern home and\nRodney took his place. It took him some little time to become familiar\nwith all the details of hotel management, but he spared no pains to\ninsure success. He had some trouble at first with the cook who presumed\nupon his position and Rodney’s supposed ignorance to run things as he\nchose.\n\nRodney complained to Mr. Pettigrew.\n\n“I think I can fix things, Rodney,” he said. “There’s a man working for\nme who used to be cook in a restaurant in New York. I found out about\nhim quietly, for I wanted to be prepared for emergencies. The next time\nGordon act contrary and threatens to leave, tell him he can do as he\npleases. Then report to me.”\n\nThe next day there came another conflict of authority.\n\n“If you don’t like the way I manage you can get somebody else,” said\nthe cook triumphantly. “Perhaps you’d like to cook the dinner yourself.\nYou’re nothing but a boy, and I don’t see what Jefferson was thinking of\nto put you in charge.”\n\n“That is his business, Mr. Gordon.”\n\n“I advise you not to interfere with me, for I won’t stand it.”\n\n“Why didn’t you talk in this way to Mr. Bailey?”\n\n“That’s neither here nor there. He wasn’t a boy for one thing.”\n\n“Then you propose to have your own way, Mr. Gordon?”\n\n“Yes, I do.”\n\n“Very well, then you can leave me at the end of this week.”\n\n“What!” exclaimed the cook in profound astonishment. “Are you going\ncrazy?”\n\n“No, I know what I am about.”\n\n“Perhaps you intend to cook yourself.”\n\n“No, I don’t. That would close up the hotel.”\n\n“Look here, young feller, you’re gettin’ too independent! I’ve a great\nmind to leave you tonight.”\n\n“You can do so if you want to,” said Rodney indifferently.\n\n“Then I will!” retorted Gordon angrily, bringing down his fist upon the\ntable in vigorous emphasis.\n\nOreville was fifty miles from Helena, and that was the nearest point, as\nhe supposed, where a new cook could be obtained.\n\nAfter supper Rodney told Jefferson Pettigrew what had happened.\n\n“Have I done right?” he asked.\n\n“Yes; we can’t have any insubordination here. There can’t be two heads\nof one establishment. Send Gordon to me.”\n\nThe cook with a defiant look answered the summons.\n\n“I understand you want to leave, Gordon,” said Jefferson Pettigrew.\n\n“That depends. I ain’t goin’ to have no boy dictatin’ to me.”\n\n“Then you insist upon having your own way without interference.”\n\n“Yes, I do.”\n\n“Very well, I accept your resignation. Do you wish to wait till the end\nof the week, or to leave tonight?”\n\n“I want to give it up tonight.”\n\n“Very well, go to Rodney and he will pay you what is due you.”\n\n“Are you goin’ to get along without a cook?” inquired Gordon in\nsurprise.\n\n“No.”\n\n“What are you going to do, then?”\n\n“I shall employ Parker in your place.”\n\n“What does he know about cookin’?”\n\n“He ran a restaurant in New York for five years, the first part of the\ntime having charge of the cooking. We shan’t suffer even if you do leave\nus.”\n\n“I think I will stay,” said Gordon in a submissive tone.\n\n“It is too late. You have discharged yourself. You can’t stay here on\nany terms.”\n\nGordon left Oreville the next day a sorely disappointed man, for he had\nreceived more liberal pay than he was likely to command elsewhere. The\nyoung landlord had triumphed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\n\nTHE MYSTERIOUS ROBBERY.\n\n\nAt the end of a month Jefferson Pettigrew said: “I’ve been looking over\nthe books, Rodney, and I find the business is better than I expected.\nHow much did I agree to pay you?”\n\n“A hundred and fifty dollars a month, but if you think that it is too\nmuch----”\n\n“Too much? Why I am going to advance you to two hundred and fifty.”\n\n“You can’t be in earnest, Mr. Pettigrew?”\n\n“I am entirely so.”\n\n“That is at the rate of three thousand dollars a year!”\n\n“Yes, but you are earning it.”\n\n“You know I am only a boy.”\n\n“That doesn’t make any difference as long as you understand your\nbusiness.”\n\n“I am very grateful to you, Mr. Pettigrew. My, I can save two hundred\ndollars a month.”\n\n“Do so, and I will find you a paying investment for the money.”\n\n“What would Jasper say to my luck?” thought Rodney.\n\nThree months passed without any incident worth recording. One afternoon\na tall man wearing a high hat and a Prince Albert coat with a paste\ndiamond of large size in his shirt bosom entered the public room of the\nMiners’ Rest and walking up to the bar prepared to register his name.\nAs he stood with his pen in his hand Rodney recognized him not without\namazement.\n\nIt was Louis Wheeler--the railroad thief, whom he had last seen in New\nYork.\n\nAs for Wheeler he had not taken any notice of the young clerk, not\nsuspecting that it was an old acquaintance who was familiar with his\nreal character.\n\n“Have you just arrived in Montana, Mr. Wheeler?” asked Rodney quietly.\n\nAs Rodney had not had an opportunity to examine his signature in the\nregister Wheeler looked up in quiet surprise.\n\n“Do you know me?” he asked.\n\n“Yes; don’t you know me?”\n\n“I’ll be blowed if it isn’t the kid,” ejaculated Wheeler.\n\n“As I run this hotel, I don’t care to be called a kid.”\n\n“All right Mr.----”\n\n“Ropes.”\n\n“Mr. Ropes, you are the most extraordinary boy I ever met.”\n\n“Am I?”\n\n“Who would have thought of your turning up as a Montana landlord.”\n\n“I wouldn’t have thought of it myself four months ago. But what brings\nyou out here?”\n\n“Business,” answered Wheeler in an important tone.\n\n“Are you going to become a miner?”\n\n“I may buy a mine if I find one to suit me.”\n\n“I am glad you seem to be prospering.”\n\n“Can you give me a good room?”\n\n“Yes, but I must ask a week’s advance payment.”\n\n“How much?”\n\n“Twenty five dollars.”\n\n“All right. Here’s the money.”\n\nLouis Wheeler pulled out a well filled wallet and handed over two ten\ndollar bills and a five.\n\n“Is that satisfactory?” he asked.\n\n“Quite so. You seem better provided with money than when I saw you\nlast.”\n\n“True. I was then in temporary difficulty. But I made a good turn in\nstocks and I am on my feet again.”\n\nRodney did not believe a word of this, but as long as Wheeler was able\nto pay his board he had no good excuse for refusing him accommodation.\n\n“That rascal here!” exclaimed Jefferson, when Rodney informed him of\nWheeler’s arrival. “Well, thats beat all! What has brought him out\nhere?”\n\n“Business, he says.”\n\n“It may be the same kind of business that he had with me. He will bear\nwatching.”\n\n“I agree with you, Mr. Pettigrew.”\n\nLouis Wheeler laid himself out to be social and agreeable, and made\nhimself quite popular with the other boarders at the hotel. As Jefferson\nand Rodney said nothing about him, he was taken at his own valuation,\nand it was reported that he was a heavy capitalist from Chicago who had\ncome to Montana to buy a mine. This theory received confirmation both\nfrom his speech and actions.\n\nOn the following day he went about in Oreville and examined the mines.\nHe expressed his opinion freely in regard to what he saw, and priced one\nthat was for sale at fifty thousand dollars.\n\n“I like this mine,” he said, “but I don’t know enough about it to make\nan offer. If it comes up to my expectations I will try it.”\n\n“He must have been robbing a bank,” observed Jefferson Pettigrew.\n\nNothing could exceed the cool assurance with which Wheeler greeted\nJefferson and recalled their meeting in New York.\n\n“You misjudged me then, Mr. Pettigrew,” he said. “I believe upon my soul\nyou looked upon me as an adventurer--a confidence man.”\n\n“You are not far from the truth, Mr. Wheeler,” answered Jefferson\nbluntly.\n\n“Well, I forgive you. Our acquaintance was brief and you judged from\nsuperficial impressions.”\n\n“Perhaps so, Mr. Wheeler. Have you ever been West before?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“When you came to Oreville had you any idea that I was here?”\n\n“No; if I had probably I should not have struck the town, as I knew that\nyou didn’t have a favorable opinion of me.”\n\n“I can’t make out much of that fellow, Rodney,” said Jefferson. “I can’t\nunderstand his object in coming here.”\n\n“He says he wants to buy a mine.”\n\n“That’s all a pretext. He hasn’t money enough to buy a mine or a tenth\npart of it.”\n\n“He seems to have money.”\n\n“Yes; he may have a few hundred dollars, but mark my words, he hasn’t\nthe slightest intention of buying a mine.”\n\n“He has some object in view.”\n\n“No doubt! What it is is what I want to find out.”\n\nThere was another way in which Louis Wheeler made himself popular among\nthe miners of Oreville. He had a violin with him, and in the evening he\nseated himself on the veranda and played popular tunes.\n\nHe had only a smattering in the way of musical training, but the airs he\nplayed took better than classical music would have done. Even Jefferson\nPettigrew enjoyed listening to “Home, Sweet Home” and “The Last Rose of\nSummer,” while the miners were captivated by merry dance tunes, which\nserved to enliven them after a long day’s work at the mines.\n\nOne day there was a sensation. A man named John O’Donnell came down\nstairs from his room looking pale and agitated.\n\n“Boys,” he said, “I have been robbed.”\n\nInstantly all eyes were turned upon him.\n\n“Of what have you been robbed, O’Donnell?” asked Jefferson.\n\n“Of two hundred dollars in gold. I was going to send it home to my wife\nin Connecticut next week.”\n\n“When did you miss it?”\n\n“Just now.”\n\n“Where did you keep it?”\n\n“In a box under my bed.”\n\n“When do you think it was taken?”\n\n“Last night.”\n\n“What makes you think so?”\n\n“I am a sound sleeper, and last night you know was very dark. I awoke\nwith a start, and seemed to hear footsteps. I looked towards the door,\nand saw a form gliding from the room.”\n\n“Why didn’t you jump out of bed and seize the intruder whoever he was?”\n\n“Because I was not sure but it was all a dream. I think now it was some\nthief who had just robbed me.”\n\n“I think so too. Could you make out anything of his appearance?”\n\n“I could only see the outlines of his figure. He was a tall man. He must\nhave taken the money from under my bed.”\n\n“Did any one know that you had money concealed there?”\n\n“I don’t think I ever mentioned it.”\n\n“It seems we have a thief among us,” said Jefferson, and almost\nunconsciously his glance rested on Louis Wheeler who was seated near\nJohn O’Donnell, “what do you think, Mr. Wheeler?”\n\n“I think you are right, Mr. Pettigrew.”\n\n“Have you any suggestion to make?” asked Jefferson. “Have you by chance\nlost anything?”\n\n“Not that I am aware of.”\n\n“Is there any one else here who has been robbed?”\n\nNo one spoke.\n\n“You asked me if I had any suggestions to make, Mr. Pettigrew,” said\nLouis Wheeler after a pause. “I have.\n\n“Our worthy friend Mr. O’Donnell has met with a serious loss. I move\nthat we who are his friends make it up to him. Here is my contribution,”\n and he laid a five dollar bill on the table.\n\nIt was a happy suggestion and proved popular. Every one present came\nforward, and tendered his contributions including Jefferson, who put\ndown twenty five dollars.\n\nMr. Wheeler gathered up the notes and gold and sweeping them to his hat\nwent forward and tendered them to John O’Donnell.\n\n“Take this money, Mr. O’Donnell,” he said. “It is the free will offering\nof your friends. I am sure I may say for them, as for myself, that it\ngives us all pleasure to help a comrade in trouble.”\n\nLouis Wheeler could have done nothing that would have so lifted him in\nthe estimation of the miners.\n\n“And now,” he said, “as our friend is out of his trouble I will play you\na few tunes on my violin, and will end the day happily.”\n\n“I can’t make out that fellow, Rodney,” said Jefferson when they were\nalone. “I believe he is the thief, but he has an immense amount of\nnerve.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\n\nMR. WHEELER EXPLAINS.\n\n\nProbably there was no one at the hotel who suspected Louis Wheeler of\nbeing a thief except Rodney and Mr. Pettigrew. His action in starting\na contribution for John O’Donnell helped to make him popular. He\nwas establishing a reputation quite new to him, and it was this fact\nprobably that made him less prudent than he would otherwise have been.\n\nAs the loss had been made up, the boarders at the Miners’ Rest ceased to\ntalk of it. But Jefferson and his young assistant did not forget it.\n\n“I am sure Wheeler is the thief, but I don’t know how to bring it home\nto him,” said Jefferson one day, when alone with Rodney.\n\n“You might search him.”\n\n“Yes, but what good would that do? It might be found that he had money,\nbut one gold coin is like another and it would be impossible to identify\nit as the stolen property. If O’Donnell had lost anything else except\nmoney it would be different. I wish he would come to my chamber.”\n\n“Perhaps he would if he thought you were a sound sleeper.”\n\n“That is an idea. I think I can make use of it.”.\n\nThat evening when Wheeler was present Mr. Pettigrew managed to turn the\nconversation to the subject of sleeping.\n\n“I am a very sound sleeper,” he said. “I remember when I was at home\nsleeping many a time through a severe thunder storm.”\n\n“Don’t you sometimes wake up in the middle of the night?” asked Rodney.\n\n“Very seldom, if I am in good health.”\n\n“Its different with me,” said another of the company. “A step on the\nfloor or the opening of the door will wake me up at any time.”\n\n“I am glad I am not so easily roused.”\n\n“If I had a fish horn,” said Rodney, laughing, “I should be tempted to\ncome up in the night and give it a blast before your door.”\n\n“That might wake me up,” said Mr. Pettigrew. “I wouldn’t advise you to\ntry it or the other boarders might get up an indignation meeting.”\n\nThe same evening Jefferson Pettigrew took out a bag of gold and\ncarelessly displayed it.\n\n“Are you not afraid of being robbed, Mr. Pettigrew?” asked Rodney.\n\n“Oh no. I never was robbed in my life.”\n\n“How much money have you there?”\n\n“I don’t know exactly. Perhaps six hundred dollars,” said Pettigrew in\nan indifferent tone.\n\nAmong those who listened to this conversation with interest was Louis\nWheeler. Rodney did not fail to see the covetous gleam of his eyes when\nthe gold was displayed.\n\nThe fact was, that Wheeler was getting short of cash and at the time\nhe took John O’Donnell’s money--for he was the thief--he had but about\ntwenty dollars left, and of this he contributed five to the relief of\nthe man he had robbed.\n\nHis theft realized him two hundred dollars, but this would not last him\nlong, as the expenses of living at the Miners’ Rest were considerable.\nHe was getting tired of Oreville, but wanted to secure some additional\nmoney before he left it. The problem was whom to make his second victim.\n\nIt would not have occurred to him to rob Jefferson Pettigrew, of whom he\nstood in wholesome fear, but for the admission that he was an unusually\nsound sleeper; even then he would have felt uncertain whether it would\npay. But the display of the bag of money, and the statement that it\ncontained six hundred dollars in gold proved a tempting bait.\n\n“If I can capture that bag of gold,” thought Wheeler, “I shall have\nenough money to set me up in some new place. There won’t be much risk\nabout it, for Pettigrew sleeps like a top. I will venture it.”\n\nJefferson Pettigrew’s chamber was on the same floor as his own. It was\nthe third room from No. 17 which Mr. Wheeler occupied.\n\nAs a general thing the occupants of the Miners’ Rest went to bed early.\nMining is a fatiguing business, and those who follow it have little\ndifficulty in dropping off to sleep. The only persons who were not\nengaged in this business were Louis Wheeler and Rodney Ropes. As a rule\nthe hotel was closed at half past ten and before this all were in bed\nand sleeping soundly.\n\nWhen Wheeler went to bed he said to himself, “This will probably be my\nlast night in this tavern. I will go from here to Helena, and if things\nturn out right I may be able to make my stay there profitable. I shan’t\ndare to stay here long after relieving Pettigrew of his bag of gold.”\n\nUnlike Jefferson Pettigrew, Wheeler was a light sleeper. He had done\nnothing to induce fatigue, and had no difficulty in keeping awake till\nhalf past eleven. Then lighting a candle, he examined his watch, and\nascertained the time.\n\n“It will be safe enough now,” he said to himself.\n\nHe rose from his bed, and drew on his trousers. Then in his stocking\nfeet he walked along the corridor till he stood in front of Jefferson\nPettigrew’s door. He was in doubt as to whether he would not be obliged\nto pick the lock, but on trying the door he found that it was not\nfastened. He opened it and stood within the chamber.\n\nCautiously he glanced at the bed. Mr. Pettigrew appeared to be sleeping\nsoundly.\n\n“It’s all right,” thought Louis Wheeler. “Now where is the bag of gold?”\n\nIt was not in open view, but a little search showed that the owner had\nput it under the bed.\n\n“He isn’t very sharp,” thought Wheeler. “He is playing right into my\nhands. Door unlocked, and bag of gold under the bed. He certainly is a\nvery unsuspicious man. However, that is all the better for me. Really\nthere isn’t much credit in stealing where all is made easy for you.”\n\nThere seemed to be nothing to do but to take the gold from its place of\ndeposit and carry it back to his own room. While there were a good many\nlodgers in the hotel, there seemed to be little risk about this, as\nevery one was asleep.\n\nOf course should the bag be found in his room that would betray him,\nbut Mr. Wheeler proposed to empty the gold coins into his gripsack, and\nthrow the bag out of the window into the back yard.\n\n“Well, here goes!” said Wheeler cheerfully, as he lifted the bag, and\nprepared to leave the chamber. But at this critical moment an unexpected\nsound struck terror into his soul. It was the sound of a key being\nturned in the lock.\n\nNervously Wheeler hastened to the door and tried it. It would not open.\nEvidently it had been locked from the outside. What could it mean?\n\nAt the same time there was a series of knocks on the outside of the\ndoor. It was the signal that had been agreed upon between Mr. Pettigrew\nand Rodney. Jefferson had given his key to Rodney, who had remained up\nand on the watch for Mr. Wheeler’s expected visit. He, too, was in his\nstocking feet.\n\nAs soon as he saw Wheeler enter his friend’s chamber he stole up and\nlocked the door on the outide. Then when he heard the thief trying to\nopen the door he rained a shower of knocks on the panel.\n\nInstantly Jefferson Pettigrew sprang out of bed and proceeded to act.\n\n“What are you doing here?” he demanded, seizing Wheeler in his powerful\ngrasp.\n\n“Where am I?” asked Wheeler in a tone of apparent bewilderment.\n\n“Oh, it’s you, Mr. Wheeler?” said Jefferson. “Don’t you know where you\nare?”\n\n“Oh, it is my friend, Mr. Pettigrew. Is it possible I am in your room?”\n\n“It is very possible. Now tell me why you are here?”\n\n“I am really ashamed to find myself in this strange position. It is not\nthe first time that I have got into trouble from walking in my sleep.”\n\n“Oh, you were walking in your sleep!”\n\n“Yes, friend Petttigrew. It has been a habit of mine since I was a boy.\nBut it seems very strange that I should have been led to your room. How\ncould I get in? Wasn’t the door locked?”\n\n“It is locked now?”\n\n“It is strange! I don’t understand it,” said Wheeler, passing his hand\nover his forehead.\n\n“Perhaps you understand why you have that bag of gold in your hand.”\n\n“Can it be possible?” ejaculated Wheeler in well counterfeited surprise.\n“I don’t know how to account for it.”\n\n“I think I can. Rodney, unlock the door and come in.”\n\nThe key was turned in the lock, and Rodney entered with a lighted candle\nin his hand.\n\n“You see, Rodney, that I have a late visitor. You will notice also that\nmy bag of gold seems to have had an attraction for him.”\n\n“I am ashamed. I don’t really know how to explain it except in this way.\nWhen you displayed the gold last night it drew my attention and I must\nhave dreamed of it. It was this which drew me unconsciously to your\ndoor. It is certainly an interesting fact in mental science.”\n\n“It would have been a still more interesting fact if you had carried off\nthe gold.”\n\n“I might even have done that in my unconsciousness, but of course I\nshould have discovered it tomorrow morning and would have returned it to\nyou.”\n\n“I don’t feel by any means sure of that. Look here, Mr. Wheeler, if that\nis your name, you can’t pull the wool over my eyes. You are a thief,\nneither more nor less.”\n\n“How can you misjudge me so, Mr. Pettigrew?”\n\n“Because I know something of your past history. It is clear to me now\nthat you were the person that stole John O’Donnell’s money.”\n\n“Indeed, Mr. Pettigrew.”\n\n“It is useless to protest. How much of it have you left?”\n\nLouis Wheeler was compelled to acknowledge the theft, and returned one\nhundred dollars to Jefferson Pettigrew.\n\n“Now,” said Jefferson, “I advise you to leave the hotel at once. If\nthe boys find out that you are a thief you will stand a chance of being\nlynched. Get out!”\n\nThe next morning Jefferson Pettigrew told the other boarders that Louis\nWheeler had had a sudden call East, and it was not for a week that he\nrevealed to them the real reason of Wheeler’s departure.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\n\nRODNEY FALLS INTO A TRAP.\n\n\nRodney had reason to be satisfied with his position as landlord of the\nMiners’ Rest. His pay was large, and enabled him to put away a good sum\nevery month, but his hours were long and he was too closely confined\nfor a boy of his age. At the end of three months he showed this in his\nappearance. His good friend Pettigrew saw it and said one day, “Rodney,\nyou are looking fagged out. You need a change.”\n\n“Does that mean that you are going to discharge me?” asked Rodney, with\na smile.\n\n“It means that I am going to give you a vacation.”\n\n“But what can I do if I take a vacation? I should not like lounging\naround Oreville with nothing to do.”\n\n“Such a vacation would do you no good. I’ll tell you the plan I have for\nyou. I own a small mine in Babcock, about fifty miles north of Oreville.\nI will send you up to examine it, and make a report to me. Can you ride\non horseback?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“That is well, for you will have to make your trip in that way. There\nare no railroads in that direction, nor any other way of travel except\non foot or on horseback. A long ride like that with hours daily in the\nopen air, will do you good. What do you say to it?”\n\n“I should like nothing better,” replied Rodney, with his eyes sparkling.\n“Only, how will you get along without me?”\n\n“I have a man in my employ at the mines who will do part of your work,\nand I will have a general oversight of things. So you need not borrow\nany trouble on that account. Do you think you can find your way?”\n\n“Give me the general direction, and I will guarantee to do so. When\nshall I start?”\n\n“Day after tomorrow. That will give me one day for making arrangements.”\n\nAt nine the appointed morning Mr. Pettigrew’s own horse stood saddled\nat the door, and Rodney in traveling costume with a small satchel in his\nhand, mounted and rode away, waving a smiling farewell to his friend and\nemployer.\n\nRodney did not hurry, and so consumed two days and a half in reaching\nBabcock. Here he was cordially received by the superintendent whom\nJefferson Pettigrew had placed in charge of the mine. Every facility was\nafforded him to examine into the management of things and he found all\nsatisfactory.\n\nThis part of his journey, therefore, may be passed over. But his return\ntrip was destined to be more exciting.\n\nRiding at an easy jog Rodney had got within fifteen miles of Oreville,\nwhen there was an unexpected interruption. Two men started out from the\nroadside, or rather from one side of the bridle path for there was no\nroad, and advanced to meet him with drawn revolvers.\n\n“Halt there!” one of them exclaimed in a commanding tone.\n\nRodney drew bridle, and gazed at the two men in surprise.\n\n“What do you want of me?” he asked.\n\n“Dismount instantly!”\n\n“Why should I? What right have you to interfere with my journey?”\n\n“Might gives right,” said one of the men sententiously. “It will be best\nfor you to do as we bid you without too much back talk.”\n\n“What are you--highwaymen?” asked Rodney.\n\n“You’d better not talk too much. Get off that horse!”\n\nRodney saw that remonstrance was useless, and obeyed the order.\n\nOne of the men seized the horse by the bridle, and led him.\n\n“Walk in front!” he said.\n\n“Where are you going to take me?” asked Rodney.\n\n“You will know in due time.”\n\n“I hope you will let me go,” urged Rodney, beginning to be uneasy. “I am\nexpected home this evening, or at all event I want to get there.”\n\n“No doubt you do, but the Miners’ Rest will have to get along without\nyou for a while.”\n\n“Do you know me then?”\n\n“Yes; you are the boy clerk at the Miners’ Rest.”\n\n“You both put up there about two weeks since,” said Rodney, examining\nclosely the faces of the two men.\n\n“Right you are, kid!”\n\n“What can you possibly want of me?”\n\n“Don’t be too curious. You will know in good time.”\n\nRodney remembered that the two men had remained at the hotel for a day\nand night. They spent the day in wandering around Oreville.\n\nHe had supposed when they came that they were in search of employment,\nbut they had not applied for work and only seemed actuated by curiosity.\nWhat could be their object in stopping him now he could not understand.\n\nIt would have been natural to suppose they wanted money, but they had\nnot asked for any as yet. He had about fifty dollars in his pocketbook\nand he would gladly have given them this if it would have insured his\nrelease. But not a word had been said about money.\n\nThey kept on their journey. Montana is a mountainous State, and they\nwere now in the hilly regions. They kept on for perhaps half an hour,\ngradually getting upon higher ground, until they reached a precipitous\nhill composed largely of rock.\n\nHere the two men stopped as if they had reached their journey’s end.\n\nOne of them advanced to the side of the hill and unlocked a thick wooden\ndoor which at first had failed to attract Rodney’s attention. The door\nswung open, revealing a dark passage, cut partly through stone and\npartly through earth. Inside on the floor was a bell of good size.\n\nOne of the men lifted the bell and rang it loudly.\n\n“What does that mean?” thought Rodney, who felt more curious than\napprehensive.\n\nHe soon learned.\n\nA curious looking negro, stunted in growth, for he was no taller than a\nboy of ten, came out from the interior and stood at the entrance of the\ncave, if such it was. His face was large and hideous, there was a hump\non his back, and his legs were not a match, one being shorter than the\nother, so that as he walked, his motion was a curious one. He bent a\nscrutinizing glance on Rodney.\n\n“Well, Caesar, is dinner ready?” asked one of the men.\n\n“No, massa, not yet.”\n\n“Let it be ready then as soon as possible. But first lead the way. We\nare coming in.”\n\nHe started ahead, leading the horse, for the entrance was high enough to\nadmit the passage of the animal.\n\n“Push on!” said the other, signing to Rodney to precede him.\n\nRodney did so, knowing remonstrance to be useless. His curiosity was\nexcited. He wondered how long the passage was and whither it led.\n\nThe way was dark, but here and there in niches was a kerosene lamp that\nfaintly relieved the otherwise intense blackness.\n\n“I have read about such places,” thought Rodney, “but I never expected\nto get into one. The wonder is, that they should bring me here. I can’t\nunderstand their object.”\n\nRodney followed his guide for perhaps two hundred and fifty feet when\nthey emerged into a large chamber of irregular shape, lighted by four\nlarge lamps set on a square wooden table. There were two rude cots in\none corner, and it was here apparently that his guides made their home.\n\nThere was a large cooking stove in one part of the room, and an\nappetizing odor showed that Caesar had the dinner under way.\n\nRodney looked about him in curiosity. He could not decide whether the\ncave was natural or artificial. Probably it was a natural cave which had\nbeen enlarged by the hand of man.\n\n“Now hurry up the dinner, Caesar,” said one of the guides. “We are all\nhungry.”\n\n“Yes, massa,” responded the obedient black.\n\nRodney felt hungry also, and hoped that he would have a share of the\ndinner. Later he trusted to find out the object of his new acquaintances\nin kidnaping him.\n\nDinner was soon ready. It was simple, but Rodney thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nDuring the meal silence prevailed. After it his new acquaintances\nproduced pipes and began to smoke. They offered Rodney a cigarette, but\nhe declined it.\n\n“I don’t smoke,” he said.\n\n“Are you a Sunday school kid?” asked one in a sneering tone.\n\n“Well, perhaps so.”\n\n“How long have you lived at Oreville?”\n\n“About four months.”\n\n“Who is the head of the settlement there?”\n\n“Jefferson Pettigrew.”\n\n“He is the moneyed man, is he?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Is he a friend of yours?”\n\n“He is my best friend,” answered Rodney warmly.\n\n“He thinks a good deal of you, then?”\n\n“I think he does.”\n\n“Where have you been--on a journey?”\n\n“Yes, to the town of Babcock.”\n\n“Did he send you?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What interest has he there?”\n\n“He is chief owner of a mine there.”\n\n“Humph! I suppose you would like to know why we brought you here.”\n\n“I would very much.”\n\n“We propose to hold you for ransom.”\n\n“But why should you? I am only a poor boy.”\n\n“You are the friend of Jefferson Pettigrew. He is a rich man. If he\nwants you back he must pay a round sum.”\n\nIt was all out now! These men were emulating a class of outlaws to be\nfound in large numbers in Italy and Sicily, and were trading upon human\nsympathy and levying a tax upon human friendship.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\n\nUNDERGROUND.\n\n\nRodney realized his position. The alternative was not a pleasant one.\nEither he must remain in the power of these men, or cost his friend Mr.\nPettigrew a large sum as ransom. There was little hope of changing the\ndetermination of his captors, but he resolved to try what he could do.\n\n“Mr. Pettigrew is under no obligations to pay money out for me,” he\nsaid. “I am not related to him, and have not yet known him six months.”\n\n“That makes no difference. You are his friend, and he likes you.”\n\n“That is the very reason why I should not wish him to lose money on my\naccount.”\n\n“Oh, very well! It will be bad for you is he doesn’t come to your help.”\n\n“Why? What do you propose to do to me?” asked Rodney boldly.\n\n“Better not ask!” was the significant reply.\n\n“But I want to know. I want to realize my position.”\n\n“The least that will happen to you is imprisonment in this cave for a\nterm of years.”\n\n“I don’t think I should like it but you would get tired of standing\nguard over me.”\n\n“We might, and in that case there is the other thing.”\n\n“What other thing?”\n\n“If we get tired of keeping you here, we shall make short work with\nyou.”\n\n“Would you murder me?” asked Rodney, horror struck, as he might well be,\nfor death seems terrible to a boy just on the threshold of life.\n\n“We might be obliged to do so.”\n\nRodney looked in the faces of his captors, and he saw nothing to\nencourage him. They looked like desperate men, who would stick at\nnothing to carry out their designs.\n\n“I don’t see why you should get hold of me,” he said. “If you had\ncaptured Mr. Pettigrew himself you would stand a better chance of making\nit pay.”\n\n“There is no chance of capturing Pettigrew. If there were we would\nprefer him to you. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.”\n\n“How much ransom do you propose to ask?”\n\nThis Rodney said, thinking that if it were a thousand dollars he might\nbe able to make it good to his friend Jefferson. But he was destined to\nbe disappointed.\n\n“Five thousand dollars,” answered the chief speaker.\n\n“Five thousand dollars!” ejaculated Rodney in dismay. “Five thousand\ndollars for a boy like me!”\n\n“That is the sum we want.”\n\n“If it were one thousand I think you might get it.”\n\n“One thousand!” repeated the other scornfully. “That wouldn’t half pay\nus.”\n\n“Then suppose you call it two thousand?”\n\n“It won’t do.”\n\n“Then I suppose I must make up my mind to remain a prisoner.”\n\n“Five thousand dollars wouldn’t be much to a rich man like Pettigrew.\nWe have inquired, and found out that he is worth at least a hundred\nthousand dollars. Five thousand is only a twentieth part of this sum.”\n\n“You can do as you please, but you had better ask a reasonable amount if\nyou expect to get it.”\n\n“We don’t want advice. We shall manage things in our own way.”\n\nConvinced that further discussion would be unavailing, Rodney relapsed\ninto silence, but now his captors proceeded to unfold their plans.\n\nOne of them procured a bottle of ink, some paper and a pen, and set them\non the table.\n\n“Come up here, boy, and write to Mr. Pettigrew,” he said in a tone of\nauthority.\n\n“What shall I write?”\n\n“Tell him that you are a prisoner, and that you will not be released\nunless he pays five thousand dollars.”\n\n“I don’t want to write that. It will be the same as asking him to pay it\nfor me.”\n\n“That is what we mean him to understand.”\n\n“I won’t write it.”\n\nRodney knew his danger, but he looked resolutely into the eyes of the\nmen who held his life in their hands. His voice did not waver, for he\nwas a manly and courageous boy.\n\n“The boy’s got grit!” said one of the men to the other.\n\n“Yes, but it won’t save him. Boy, are you going to write what I told\nyou?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Are you not afraid that we will kill you?”\n\n“You have power to do it.”\n\n“Don’t you want to live?”\n\n“Yes. Life is sweet to a boy of sixteen.”\n\n“Then why don’t you write?”\n\n“Because I think it would be taking a mean advantage of Mr. Pettigrew.”\n\n“You are a fool. Roderick, what shall we do with him?”\n\n“Tell him simply to write that he is in our hands.”\n\n“Well thought of. Boy, will you do that?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nRodney gave his consent for he was anxious that Mr. Pettigrew should\nknow what had prevented him from coming home when he was expected.\n\n“Very well, write! You will know what to say.”\n\nRodney drew the paper to him, and wrote as follows:\n\n\nDEAR MR. PETTIGREW,\n\nOn my way home I was stopped by two men who have confined me in a cave,\nand won’t let me go unless a sum of money is paid for my ransom. I don’t\nknow what to do. You will know better than I. RODNEY ROPES.\n\n\nHis chief captor took the note and read it aloud.\n\n“That will do,” he said. “Now he will believe us when we say that you\nare in our hands.”\n\nHe signed to Rodney to rise from the table and took his place. Drawing a\npile of paper to him, he penned the following note:\n\n\nRodney Ropes is in our hands. He wants his liberty and we want money.\nSend us five thousand dollars, or arrange a meeting at which it can be\ndelivered to us, and he shall go free. Otherwise his death be on your\nhands. HIS CAPTORS.\n\n\nRodney noticed that this missive was written in a handsome business\nhand.\n\n“You write a handsome hand,” he said.\n\n“I ought to,” was the reply. “I was once bookkeeper in a large business\nhouse.”\n\n“And what--” here Rodney hesitated.\n\n“What made me an outlaw you mean to ask?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“My nature, I suppose. I wasn’t cut out for sober, humdrum life.”\n\n“Don’t you think you would have been happier?”\n\n“No preaching, kid! I had enough of that when I used to go to church in\nmy old home in Missouri. Here, Caesar!”\n\n“Yes, massa.”\n\n“You know Oreville?”\n\n“Yes, massa.”\n\n“Go over there and take this letter with you. Ask for Jefferson\nPettigrew, and mind you don’t tell him where we live. Only if he asks\nabout me and my pal say we are desperate men, have each killed a round\ndozen of fellows that stood in our way and will stick at nothing.”\n\n“All right, massa,” said Caesar with an appreciative grin. “How shall I\ngo, massa?”\n\n“You can take the kid’s horse. Ride to within a mile of Oreville, then\ntether the horse where he won’t easily be found, and walk over to the\nmines. Do you understand?”\n\n“Yes, massa.”\n\n“He won’t probably give you any money, but he may give you a letter.\nBring it safely to me.”\n\nCaesar nodded and vanished.\n\nFor an hour the two men smoked their pipes and chatted. Then they rose,\nand the elder said: “We are going out, kid, for a couple of hours. Are\nyou afraid to stay alone?”\n\n“Why should I be?”\n\n“That’s the way to talk. I won’t caution you not to escape, for it would\ntake a smarter lad then you to do it. If you are tired you can lie down\non the bed and rest.”\n\n“All right!”\n\n“I am sorry we haven’t got the morning paper for you to look over,” said\nhis captor with a smile. “The carrier didn’t leave it this morning.”\n\n“I can get along without it. I don’t feel much like reading.”\n\n“You needn’t feel worried. You’ll be out of this tomorrow if Jefferson\nPettigrew is as much your friend as you think he is.”\n\n“The only thing that troubles me is the big price you charge at your\nhotel.”\n\n“Good! The kid has a good wit of his own. After all, we wouldn’t\nmind keeping you with us. It might pay you better than working for\nPettigrew.”\n\n“I hope you’ll excuse my saying it, but I don’t like the business.”\n\n“You may change your mind. At your age we wouldn’t either of us like the\nsort of life we are leading. Come, John.”\n\nThe two men went out but did not allow Rodney to accompany them to the\nplace of exit.\n\nLeft to himself, Rodney could think soberly of his plight. He could not\nforesee whether his captivity would be brief or prolonged.\n\nAfter a time the spirit of curiosity seized him. He felt tempted\nto explore the cavern in which he was confined. He took a lamp, and\nfollowed in a direction opposite to that taken by his captors.\n\nThe cave he found was divided into several irregularly shaped chambers.\nHe walked slowly, holding up the lamp to examine the walls of the\ncavern. In one passage he stopped short, for something attracted his\nattention--something the sight of which made his heart beat quicker and\nfilled him with excitement.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\n\nRODNEY’S DISCOVERY.\n\n\nThere was a good reason for Rodney’s excitement. The walls of the\nsubterranean passage revealed distinct and rich indications of gold.\nThere was a time, and that not long before, when they would have\nrevealed nothing to Rodney, but since his residence at Oreville he had\nmore than once visited the mines and made himself familiar with surface\nindications of mineral deposit.\n\nHe stopped short and scanned attentively the walls of the passage.\n\n“If I am not mistaken,” he said to himself, “this will make one of the\nrichest mines in Montana. But after all what good will it do me? Here am\nI a prisoner, unable to leave the cave, or communicate with my friends.\nIf Mr. Pettigrew knew what I do he would feel justified in paying the\nransom these men want.”\n\nRodney wondered how these rich deposits had failed to attract the\nattention of his captors, but he soon settled upon the conclusion that\nthey had no knowledge of mines or mining, and were ignorant of the\nriches that were almost in their grasp.\n\n“Shall I enlighten them?” he asked himself.\n\nIt was a question which he could not immediately answer. He resolved to\nbe guided by circumstances.\n\nIn order not to excite suspicion he retraced his steps to the apartment\nused by his captors as a common sitting room--carefully fixing in his\nmind the location of the gold ore.\n\nWe must now follow the messenger who had gone to Oreville with a letter\nfrom Rodney’s captors.\n\nAs instructed, he left his horse, or rather Rodney’s, tethered at some\ndistance from the settlement and proceeded on foot to the Miners’ Rest.\nHis strange appearance excited attention and curiosity. Both these\nfeelings would have been magnified had it been known on what errand he\ncame.\n\n“Where can I find Mr. Jefferson Pettigrew?” he asked of a man whom he\nsaw on the veranda.\n\n“At the Griffin Mine,” answered the other, removing the pipe from his\nmouth.\n\n“Where is that?”\n\n“Over yonder. Are you a miner?”\n\n“No. I know nothing about mines.”\n\n“Then why do you want to see Jefferson? I thought you might want a\nchance to work in the mine.”\n\n“No; I have other business with him--business of importance,” added the\nblack dwarf emphatically.\n\n“If that is the case I’ll take you to him. I am always glad to be of\nservice to Jefferson.”\n\n“Thank you. He will thank you, too.”\n\nThe man walked along with a long, swinging gait which made it difficult\nfor Caesar to keep up with him.\n\n“So you have business with Jefferson?” said the man with the pipe, whose\ncuriosity had been excited.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Of what sort?”\n\n“I will tell him,” answered Caesar shortly.\n\n“So its private, is it?”\n\n“Yes. If he wants to tell you he will.”\n\n“That’s fair. Well, come along! Am I walking too fast for you?”\n\n“Your legs are much longer than mine.”\n\n“That’s so. You are a little shrimp. I declare.”\n\nA walk of twenty minutes brought them to the Griffin Mine. Jefferson\nPettigrew was standing near, giving directions to a party of miners.\n\n“Jefferson,” said the man with the pipe, “here’s a chap that wants to\nsee you on business of importance. That is, he says it is.”\n\nJefferson Pettigrew wheeled round and looked at Caesar.\n\n“Well,” he said, “what is it?”\n\n“I have a letter for you, massa.”\n\n“Give it to me.”\n\nJefferson took the letter and cast his eye over it. As he read it his\ncountenance changed and became stern and severe.\n\n“Do you know what is in this letter?” he asked.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Come with me.”\n\nHe led Caesar to a place out of earshot.\n\n“What fiend’s game is this?” he demanded sternly.\n\n“I can’t tell you, massa; I’m not in it.”\n\n“Who are those men that have written to me?”\n\n“I don’t know their right names. I calls ‘em Massa John and Massa Dick.”\n\n“It seems they have trapped a boy friend of mine, Rodney Ropes. Did you\nsee him?”\n\n“Yes; I gave him a good dinner.”\n\n“That is well. If they should harm a hair of his head I wouldn’t\nrest till I had called them to account. Where have they got the boy\nconcealed?”\n\n“I couldn’t tell you, massa.”\n\n“You mean, you won’t tell me.”\n\n“Yes. It would be as much as my life is worth.”\n\n“Humph, well! I suppose you must be faithful to your employer. Do you\nknow that these men want me to pay five thousand dollars for the return\nof the boy?”\n\n“Yes, I heard them talking about it.”\n\n“That is a new kind of rascality. Do they expect you to bring back an\nanswer?”\n\n“Yes, massa.”\n\n“I must think. What will they do to the boy if I don’t give them the\nmoney?”\n\n“They might kill him.”\n\n“If they do--but I must have time to think the matter over. Are you\nexpected to go back this afternoon?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Can you get back? It must be a good distance.”\n\n“I can get back.”\n\n“Stay here. I will consult some of my friends and see if I can raise the\nmoney.”\n\n“Very well, massa.” One of those whom Jefferson called into consultation\nwas the person who had guided Caesar to the Griffin Mine.\n\nQuickly the proprietor of the Miners’ Rest unfolded the situation.\n\n“Now,” he said, “I want two of you to follow this misshapen dwarf, and\nfind out where he comes from. I want to get hold of the scoundrels who\nsent him to me.”\n\n“I will be one,” said the man with the pipe.\n\n“Very well, Fred.”\n\n“And I will go with Fred,” said a long limbed fellow who had been a\nKansas cowboy.\n\n“I accept you, Otto. Go armed, and don’t lose sight of him.”\n\n“Shall you send the money?”\n\n“Not I. I will send a letter that will encourage them to hope for it. I\nwant to gain time.”\n\n“Any instructions, Jefferson?”\n\n“Only this, if you see these men, capture or kill them.”\n\n“All right.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\n\nA BLOODY CONFLICT.\n\n\nThis was the letter that was handed to Caesar:\n\n\nI have received your note. I must have time to think, and time perhaps\nto get hold of the gold. Don’t harm a hair of the boy’s head. If so, I\nwill hunt you to death.\n\nJEFFERSON PETTIGREW.\n\n\nP.S.--Meet me tomorrow morning at the rocky gorge at the foot of Black\nMountain. Ten o’clock.\n\n\nCaesar took the letter, and bent his steps in the direction of the place\nwhere he had tethered his horse. He did not observe that he was\nfollowed by two men, who carefully kept him in sight, without attracting\nattention to themselves.\n\nWhen Caesar reached the place where he had tethered the horse, he was\ngrievously disappointed at not finding him. One of the miners in\nroaming about had come upon the animal, and knowing him to be Jefferson\nPettigrew’s property, untied him and rode him back to Oreville.\n\nThe dwarf threw up his hands in dismay.\n\n“The horse is gone!” he said in his deep bass voice, “and now I must\nwalk back, ten long miles, and get a flogging at the end for losing\ntime. It’s hard luck,” he groaned.\n\nThe loss was fortunate for Fred and Otto who would otherwise have found\nit hard to keep up with the dwarf.\n\nCaesar breathed a deep sigh, and then started on his wearisome journey.\nHad the ground been even it would have troubled him less, but there was\na steep upward grade, and his short legs were soon weary. Not so with\nhis pursuers, both of whom were long limbed and athletic.\n\nWe will go back now to the cave and the captors of Rodney. They waited\nlong and impatiently for the return of their messenger. Having no\nknowledge of the loss of the horse, they could not understand what\ndetained Caesar.\n\n“Do you think the rascal has played us false?” said Roderick.\n\n“He would be afraid to.”\n\n“This man Pettigrew might try to bribe him. It would be cheaper than to\npay five thousand dollars.”\n\n“He wouldn’t dare. He knows what would happen to him,” said John grimly.\n\n“Then why should he be so long?”\n\n“That I can’t tell.”\n\n“Suppose we go out to meet him. I begin to feel anxious lest we have\ntrusted him too far.”\n\n“I am with you!”\n\nThe two outlaws took the path which led to Oreville, and walked two\nmiles before they discovered Caesar coming towards them at a slow and\nmelancholy gait.\n\n“There he is, and on foot! What does it mean?”\n\n“He will tell us.”\n\n“Here now, you black imp! where is the horse?” demanded Roderick.\n\n“I done lost him, massa.”\n\n“Lost him? You’ll get a flogging for this, unless you bring good news.\nDid you see Jefferson Pettigrew?”\n\n“Yes, massa.”\n\n“Did he give you any money?”\n\n“No; he gave me this letter.”\n\nRoderick snatched it from his hand, and showed it to John.\n\n“It seems satisfactory,” he said. “Now how did you lose the horse?”\n\nCaesar told him.\n\n“You didn’t fasten him tight.”\n\n“Beg your pardon, massa, but I took good care of that.”\n\n“Well, he’s gone; was probably stolen. That is unfortunate; however you\nmay not have been to blame.”\n\nLuckily for Caesar the letter which he brought was considered\nsatisfactory, and this palliated his fault in losing the horse.\n\nThe country was so uneven that the two outlaws did not observe that they\nwere followed, until they came to the entrance of the cave. Then, before\nopening the door, John looked round and caught sight of Fred and Otto\neying them from a little distance.\n\nHe instantly took alarm.\n\n“Look,” he said, “we are followed. Look behind you!”\n\nHis brother turned and came to the same conclusion.\n\n“Caesar,” said Roderick, “did you ever see those men before?”\n\n“No, massa.”\n\n“They must have followed you from Oreville. Hello, you two!” he added\nstriding towards the miners. “What do you want here?”\n\nFred and Otto had accomplished their object in ascertaining the place\nwhere Rodney was confined, and no longer cared for concealment.\n\n“None of your business!” retorted Fred independently. “The place is as\nfree to us as to you.”\n\n“Are you spies?”\n\n“I don’t intend to answer any of your questions.”\n\n“Clear out of here!” commanded Roderick in a tone of authority.\n\n“Suppose we don’t?”\n\nRoderick was a man of quick temper, and had never been in the habit of\ncurbing it. He was provoked by the independent tone of the speaker, and\nwithout pausing to think of the imprudence of his actions, he raised his\nrifle and pointing at Fred shot him in the left arm.\n\nThe two miners were both armed, and were not slow in accepting the\nchallenge. Simultaneously they raised their rifles and fired at the two\nmen. The result was that both fell seriously wounded and Caesar set up a\nhowl of dismay, not so much for his masters as from alarm for himself.\n\nFred and Otto came forward, and stood looking down upon the outlaws, who\nwere in the agonies of death.\n\n“It was our lives or theirs,” said Fred coolly, for he had been long\nenough in Montana to become used to scenes of bloodshed.\n\n“Yes,” answered Otto. “I think these two men are the notorious Dixon\nbrothers who are credited with a large number of murders. The country\nwill be well rid of them.”\n\nRoderick turned his glazing eyes upon the tall miner. “I wish I had\nkilled you,” he muttered.\n\n“No doubt you do. It wouldn’t have been your first murder.”\n\n“Don’t kill me, massa!” pleaded Caesar in tones of piteous entreaty.\n\n“I don’t know,” answered Fred. “That depends on yourself. If you obey us\nstrictly we will spare you.”\n\n“Try me, massa!”\n\n“You black hound!” said Roderick hoarsely. “If I were not disabled I’d\nkill you myself.”\n\nHere was a new danger for poor Caesar, for he knew Roderick’s fierce\ntemper.\n\n“Don’t let him kill me!” he exclaimed, affrighted.\n\n“He shall do you no harm. Will you obey me?”\n\n“Tell me what you want, massa.”\n\n“Is the boy these men captured inside?”\n\n“Yes, massa.”\n\n“Open the cave, then. We want him.”\n\n“Don’t do it,” said Roderick, but Caesar saw at a glance that his old\nmaster, of whom he stood in wholesome fear, was unable to harm him, and\nhe proceeded to unlock the door.\n\n“Go and call the boy!” said Fred.\n\nCaesar disappeared within the cavern, and soon emerged with Rodney\nfollowing him.\n\n“Are you unhurt?” asked Fred anxiously.\n\n“Yes, and overjoyed to see you. How came you here?”\n\n“We followed the nigger from Oreville.”\n\nWhat happened afterwards Rodney did not need to inquire, for the two\noutstretched figures, stiffening in death, revealed it to him.\n\n“They are the Dixon brothers, are they not?” asked Fred, turning to\nCaesar.\n\n“Yes, massa.”\n\n“Then we are entitled to a thousand dollars each for their capture. I\nhave never before shed blood, but I don’t regret ending the career of\nthese scoundrels.”\n\nHalf an hour later the two outlaws were dead and Rodney and his friends\nwere on their way back to Oreville.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\n\nTHE RODNEY MINE.\n\n\nRodney was received by Jefferson Pettigrew with open arms.\n\n“Welcome home, boy!” he said. “I was very much worried about you.”\n\n“I was rather uneasy about myself,” returned Rodney.\n\n“Well, it’s all over, and all’s well that ends well. You are free and\nthere has been no money paid out. Fred and Otto have done a good thing\nin ridding the world of the notorious Dixon brothers. They will be\nwell paid, for I understand there is a standing reward of one thousand\ndollars for each of them dead or alive. I don’t know but you ought\nto have a share of this, for it was through you that the outlaws were\ntrapped.”\n\n“No, Mr. Pettigrew, they are welcome to the reward. If I am not mistaken\nI shall make a good deal more out of it than they.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\nUpon this Rodney told the story of what he had seen in the cavern.\n\n“When I said I, I meant we, Mr. Pettigrew. I think if the gold there is\nas plentiful as I think it is we shall do well to commence working it.”\n\n“It is yours, Rodney, by right of first discovery.”\n\n“I prefer that you should share it with me.”\n\n“We will go over tomorrow and make an examination. Was there any one\nelse who seemed to have a claim to the cave except the Dixons?”\n\n“No. The negro, Caesar, will still be there, perhaps.”\n\n“We can easily get rid of him.”\n\nThe next day the two friends went over to the cavern. Caesar was still\nthere, but he had an unsettled, restless look, and seemed undecided what\nto do.\n\n“What are you going to do, Caesar?” asked Pettigrew. “Are you going to\nstay here?”\n\n“I don’t know, massa. I don’t want to lib here. I’m afraid I’ll see the\nghostes of my old massas. But I haven’t got no money.”\n\n“If you had money where would you go?”\n\n“I’d go to Chicago. I used to be a whitewasher, and I reckon I’d get\nwork at my old trade.”\n\n“That’s where you are sensible, Caesar. This is no place for you. Now\nI’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll give you a hundred dollars, and you can\ngo where you like. But I shall want you to go away at once.”\n\n“I’ll go right off, massa,” said Caesar, overjoyed. “I don’t want to\ncome here no more.”\n\n“Have you got anything belonging to you in the cave?”\n\n“No, massa, only a little kit of clothes.”\n\n“Take them and go.”\n\nIn fifteen minutes Caesar had bidden farewell to his home, and Rodney\nand Jefferson were left in sole possession of the cavern.\n\n“Now, Mr. Pettigrew, come and let me show you what I saw. I hope I have\nmade no mistake.”\n\nRodney led the way to the narrow passage already described. By the light\nof a lantern Mr. Pettigrew examined the walls. For five minutes not a\nword was said.\n\n“Well, what do you think of it?” asked Rodney anxiously.\n\n“Only this: that you have hit upon the richest gold deposits in Montana.\nHere is a mining prospect that will make us both rich.”\n\n“I am glad I was not mistaken,” said Rodney simply.\n\n“Your capture by the Dixon brothers will prove to have been the luckiest\nevent in your life. I shall lose no time in taking possession in our\njoint name.”\n\nThere was great excitement when the discovery of the gold deposit was\nmade known. In connection with the killing of the outlaws, it was noised\nfar and wide. The consequence was that there was an influx of mining\nmen, and within a week Rodney and Jefferson were offered a hundred\nthousand dollars for a half interest in the mine by a Chicago syndicate.\n\n“Say a hundred and fifty thousand, and we accept the offer,” said\nJefferson Pettigrew.\n\nAfter a little haggling this offer was accepted, and Rodney found\nhimself the possessor of seventy five thousand dollars in cash.\n\n“It was fortunate for me when I fell in with you, Mr. Pettigrew,” he\nsaid.\n\n“And no less fortunate for me, Rodney. This mine will bring us in a rich\nsum for our share, besides the cash we already have in hand.”\n\n“If you don’t object, Mr. Pettigrew, I should like to go to New York and\ncontinue my education. You can look after my interest here, and I shall\nbe willing to pay you anything you like for doing so.”\n\n“There won’t be any trouble about that, Rodney. I don’t blame you for\nwanting to obtain an education. It isn’t in my line. You can come out\nonce a year, and see what progress we are making. The mine will be\ncalled the Rodney Mine after you.”\n\nThe Miners’ Rest was sold to the steward, as Mr. Pettigrew was too busy\nto attend to it, and in a week Rodney was on his way to New York.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\n\nOtis Goodnow arrived at his place of business a little earlier than\nusual, and set himself to looking over his mail. Among other letters was\none written on paper bearing the name of the Fifth Avenue Hotel. He came\nto this after a time and read it.\n\nIt ran thus:\n\n\nDEAR SIR:\n\nI was once in your employ, though you may not remember my name. I was in\nthe department of Mr. Redwood, and there I became acquainted with Jasper\nRedwood, his nephew. I was discharged, it is needless to recall why. I\nhad saved nothing, and of course I was greatly embarrassed. I could not\nreadily obtain another place, and in order to secure money to pay living\nexpenses I entered into an arrangement with Jasper Redwood to sell me\narticles, putting in more than I paid for. These I was enabled to sell\nat a profit to smaller stores. This was not as profitable as it might\nhave been to me, as I was obliged to pay Jasper a commission for\nhis agency. Well, after a time it was ascertained that articles were\nmissing, and search was made for the thief. Through a cunningly devised\nscheme of Jasper’s the theft was ascribed to Rodney Ropes, a younger\nclerk, and he was discharged. Ropes was a fine young fellow, and I have\nalways been sorry that he got into trouble through our agency, but there\nseemed no help for it. It must rest on him or us. He protested\nhis innocence, but was not believed. I wish to say now that he was\nabsolutely innocent, and only Jasper and myself were to blame. If you\ndoubt my statement I will call today, and you may confront me with\nJasper. I desire that justice should be done.\n                                            PHILIP CARTON.\n\n\n“Call Mr. Redwood,” said the merchant, summoning a boy.\n\nIn five minutes Mr. Redwood entered the office of his employer.\n\n“You sent for me, sir?”\n\n“Yes, Mr. Redwood; cast your eye over this letter.”\n\nJames Redwood read the letter, and his face showed the agitation he\nfelt.\n\n“I don’t know anything about this, Mr. Goodnow,” he said at last.\n\n“It ought to be inquired into.”\n\n“I agree with you. If my nephew is guilty I want to know it.”\n\n“We will wait till the writer of this letter calls. Do you remember\nhim?”\n\n“Yes, sir; he was discharged for intemperance.”\n\nAt twelve o’clock Philip Carton made his appearance, and asked to be\nconducted to Mr. Goodnow’s private office.\n\n“You are the writer of this letter?” asked the merchant.\n\n“Yes sir.”\n\n“And you stand by the statement it contains?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Why, at this late day, have you made a confession?”\n\n“Because I wish to do justice to Rodney Ropes, who has been unjustly\naccused, and also because I have been meanly treated by Jasper Redwood,\nwho has thrown me over now that he has no further use for me.”\n\n“Are you willing to repeat your statement before him?”\n\n“I wish to do so.”\n\n“Call Jasper Redwood, Sherman,” said the merchant, addressing himself to\nSherman White, a boy recently taken into his employ.\n\nJasper entered the office, rather surprised at the summons. When he saw\nhis accomplice, he changed color, and looked confused.\n\n“Jasper,” said the merchant, “read this letter and tell me what you have\nto say in reply.”\n\nJasper ran his eye over the letter, while his color came and went.\n\n“Well?”\n\n“It’s a lie,” said Jasper hoarsely.\n\n“Do you still insist that the articles taken from my stock were taken by\nRodney Ropes?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“What do you say, Mr. Carton?”\n\n“Not one was taken by Rodney Ropes. Jasper and I are responsible for\nthem all.”\n\n“What proof can you bring?”\n\n“Mr. James Redwood will recall the purchase I made at the time of the\nthefts. He will recall that I always purchased of Jasper.”\n\n“That is true,” said Mr. Redwood in a troubled voice.\n\n“Do you confess, Jasper Redwood?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“If you will tell the truth, I will see that no harm comes to you. I\nwant to clear this matter up.”\n\nJasper thought the matter over. He saw that the game was up--and decided\nrapidly that confession was the best policy.\n\n“Very well, sir, if I must I will do so, but that man put me up to it.”\n\n“You did not need any putting up to it. I wish young Ropes were here,\nthat I might clear him.”\n\nAs if in answer to the wish a bronzed and manly figure appeared at the\noffice door. It was Rodney, but taller and more robust than when he left\nthe store nearly a year before.\n\n“Rodney Ropes!” ejaculated Jasper in great surprise.\n\n“Yes, Jasper, I came here to see you, and beg you to free me from the\nfalse charge which was brought against me when I was discharged from\nthis store. I didn’t find you in your usual places, and was directed\nhere.”\n\n“Ropes,” said Mr. Goodnow, “your innocence has been established. This\nman,” indicating Philip Carton, “has confessed that it was he and Jasper\nwho stole the missing articles.”\n\n“I am thankful that my character has been cleared.”\n\n“I am ready to take you back into my employ.”\n\n“Thank you, sir, but I have now no need of a position. I shall be glad\nif you will retain Jasper.”\n\n“You are very generous to one who has done so much to injure you.”\n\n“Indirectly he put me in the way of making a fortune. If you will retain\nhim, Mr. Goodnow, I will guarantee to make up any losses you may incur\nfrom him.”\n\n“How is this? Are you able to make this guarantee?”\n\n“I am worth seventy five thousand dollars in money, besides being owner\nof a large mining property in Montana.”\n\n“This is truly wonderful! And you have accumulated all this since you\nleft my store?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Rodney,” said Jasper, going up to his old rival, and offering his hand.\n“I am sorry I tried to injure you. It was to save myself, but I see now\nhow meanly I acted.”\n\n“That speech has saved you,” said the merchant. “Go back to your work. I\nwill give you another chance.”\n\n“Will you take me back also, Mr. Goodnow?” asked Philip Carton.\n\nThe merchant hesitated.\n\n“No, Mr. Carton,” said Rodney. “I will look out for you. I will send\nyou to Montana with a letter to my partner. You can do better there than\nhere.”\n\nTears came into the eyes of the ex-clerk.\n\n“Thank you,” he said gratefully. “I should prefer it. I will promise to\nturn over a new leaf; and justify your recommendation.”\n\n“Come to see me this evening at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, and I will\narrange matters.”\n\n“Shall you stay in the city long, Ropes?” asked the merchant.\n\n“About a week.”\n\n“Come and dine with me on Tuesday evening.”\n\n“Thank you, sir.”\n\n\nLater in the day Rodney sought out his old room mate Mike Flynn. He\nfound Mike in a bad case. He had a bad cold, but did not dare to give up\nwork, because he wouldn’t be able to meet his bills. He was still in the\nemploy of the District Telegraph Company.\n\n“Give the company notice, Mike,” said Rodney. “Henceforth I will take\ncare of you. You can look upon me as your rich uncle,” he added with a\nsmile.\n\n“I will be your servant, Rodney.”\n\n“Not a bit of it. You will be my friend. But you must obey me\nimplicitly. I am going to send you to school, and give you a chance\nto learn something. Next week I shall return to Dr. Sampson’s boarding\nschool and you will go with me as my friend and room mate.”\n\n“But, Rodney, you will be ashamed of me. I am awfully shabby.”\n\n“You won’t be long. You shall be as well dressed as I am.”\n\nA week later the two boys reached the school. It would have been hard\nfor any of Mike’s old friends to recognize him in the handsomely dressed\nboy who accompanied Rodney.\n\n“Really, Mike, you are quite good looking, now that you are well\ndressed,” said Rodney.\n\n“Oh, go away with you, Rodney? It’s fooling me you are!”\n\n“Not a bit of it. Now I want you to improve your time and learn as fast\nas you can.”\n\n“I will, Rodney.”\n\nA year later Rodney left school, but he kept Mike there two years\nlonger. There had been a great change in the telegraph boy, who was\nquick to learn. He expects, when he leaves school, to join Rodney in\nMontana.\n\nI will not attempt to estimate Rodney’s present wealth, but he is\nalready prominent in financial circles in his adopted State. Philip\nCarton is prospering, and is respected by his new friends, who know\nnothing of his earlier life.\n\nAs I write, Rodney has received a letter from his old guardian, Benjamin\nFielding. The letter came from Montreal.\n\n“My dear Rodney,” he wrote. “I have worked hard to redeem the past, and\nrestore to you your fortune. I have just succeeded, and send you the\namount with interest. It leaves me little or nothing, but my mind is\nrelieved. I hope you have not had to suffer severely from my criminal\ncarelessness, and that you will live long to enjoy what rightfully\nbelongs to you.”\n\nIn reply Rodney wrote: “Please draw on me for fifty thousand dollars.\nI do not need it, and you do. Five years from now, if you can spare the\nmoney you may send it to me. Till then use it without interest. I am\nworth much more than the sum my father intrusted to you for me.”\n\nThis offer was gratefully accepted, and Mr. Fielding is now in New York,\nwhere he is likely to experience a return of his former prosperity.\n\nAs for Rodney, his trials are over. They made a man of him, and proved a\nblessing in disguise.",
