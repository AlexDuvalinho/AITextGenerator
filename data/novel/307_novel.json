But, Lord,\nyou can fix 'em up if you want to. Did you ever hear about Henery, that\nused to drive for old John Bull--about Henery and the elephant?”\n\nAlfred was chauffeur to a friend of mine who owned a very powerful car.\nAlfred was part of that car. Weirdly intelligent, of poor physique, he\nmight have been any age from fifteen to eighty. His education had been\nsomewhat hurried, but there was no doubt as to his mechanical ability.\nHe took to a car like a young duck to water. He talked motor, thought\nmotor, and would have accepted--I won't say with enthusiasm, for\nAlfred's motto was 'Nil admirari'--but without hesitation, an offer to\ndrive in the greatest race in the world. He could drive really well,\ntoo; as for belief in himself, after six months' apprenticeship in\na garage he was prepared to vivisect a six-cylinder engine with the\nconfidence of a diplomaed bachelor of engineering.\n\nBarring a tendency to flash driving, and a delight in persecuting slow\ncars by driving just in front of them and letting them come up and enjoy\nhis dust, and then shooting away again, he was a respectable member of\nsociety. When his boss was in the car he cloaked the natural ferocity of\nhis instincts; but this day, with only myself on board, and a clear run\nof a hundred and twenty miles up to the station before him, he let her\nloose, confident that if any trouble occurred I would be held morally\nresponsible.\n\nAs we flew past a somnolent bush pub, Alfred, whistling softly, leant\nforward and turned on a little more oil.\n\n“You never heard about Henery and the elephant?” he said. “It was dead\nfunny. Henery was a bushwacker, but clean mad on motorin'. He was wood\nand water joey at some squatter's place until he seen a motor-car go\npast one day, the first that ever they had in the districk.\n\n“'That's my game,' says Henery; 'no more wood and water joey for me.'\n\n“So he comes to town and gets a job off Miles that had that garage at\nthe back of Allison's. An old cove that they called John Bull--I don't\nknow his right name, he was a fat old cove--he used to come there to\nhire cars, and Henery used to drive him. And this old John Bull he\nhad lots of stuff, so at last he reckons he's going to get a car for\nhimself, and he promises Henery a job to drive it. A queer cove this\nHenery was--half mad, I think, but the best hand with a car ever I see.”\n\nWhile he had been talking we topped a hill, and opened up a new stretch\nof blue-grey granite-like road. Down at the foot of the hill was a\nteamster's waggon in camp; the horses in their harness munching at their\nnose-bags, while the teamster and a mate were boiling a billy a little\noff to the side of the road. There was a turn in the road just below\nthe waggon which looked a bit sharp, so of course Alfred bore down on it\nlike a whirlwind. The big stupid team-horses huddled together and pushed\neach other awkwardly as we passed. A dog that had been sleeping in\nthe shade of the waggon sprang out right in front of the car, and was\nexterminated without ever knowing what struck him.\n\nThere was just room to clear the tail of the waggon and negotiate the\nturn. Alfred, with the calm decision of a Napoleon, swung round the bend\nto find that the teamster's hack, fast asleep, was tied to the tail of\nthe waggon. Nothing but a lightning-like twist of the steering-wheel\nprevented our scooping the old animal up, and taking him on board as a\npassenger. As it was, we carried off most of his tail as a trophy on the\nbrass of the lamp. The old steed, thus rudely awakened, lashed out good\nand hard, but by that time we were gone, and he missed the car by a\nquarter of a mile.\n\nDuring this strenuous episode Alfred never relaxed his professional\nstolidity, and, when we were clear, went on with his story in the tone\nof a man who found life wanting in animation.\n\n“Well, at fust, the old man would only buy one of these little\neight-horse rubby-dubbys that go strugglin' up 'ills with a death-rattle\nin its throat, and all the people in buggies passin' it. O' course that\ndidn't suit Henery. He used to get that spiked when a car passed him,\nhe'd nearly go mad. And one day he nearly got the sack for dodgin' about\nup a steep 'ill in front of one o' them big twenty-four Darracqs, full\nof 'owlin' toffs, and not lettin' 'em get a chance to go past till they\ngot to the top. But at last he persuaded old John Bull to let him go\nto England and buy a car for him. He was to do a year in the shops, and\npick up all the wrinkles, and get a car for the old man. Bit better than\nwood and water joeying, wasn't it?”\n\nOur progress here was barred by our rounding a corner right on to a\nflock of sheep, that at once packed together into a solid mass in front\nof us, blocking the whole road from fence to fence.\n\n“Silly cows o' things, ain't they?” said Alfred, putting on his\nemergency brake, and skidding up till the car came softly to rest\nagainst the cushion-like mass--a much quicker stop than any horse-drawn\nvehicle could have made. A few sheep were crushed somewhat, but it\nis well known that a sheep is practically indestructible by violence.\nWhatever Alfred's faults were, he certainly could drive.\n\n“Well,” he went on, lighting a cigarette, unheeding the growls of the\ndrovers, who were trying to get the sheep to pass the car, “well, as I\nwas sayin', Henery went to England, and he got a car. Do you know wot he\ngot?”\n\n“No, I don't.”\n\n“'E got a ninety,” said Alfred slowly, giving time for the words to soak\nin.\n\n“A ninety! What do you mean?”\n\n“'E got a ninety--a ninety-horse-power racin' engine wot was made\nfor some American millionaire and wasn't as fast as wot some other\nmillionaire had, so he sold it for the price of the iron, and Henery got\nit, and had a body built for it, and he comes out here and tells us all\nit's a twenty mongrel--you know, one of them cars that's made part in\none place and part in another, the body here and the engine there, and\nthe radiator another place. There's lots of cheap cars made like that.\n\n“So Henery he says that this is a twenty mongrel--only a four-cylinder\nengine; and nobody drops to what she is till Henery goes out one Sunday\nand waits for the big Napier that Scotty used to drive--it belonged to\nthe same bloke wot owned that big racehorse wot won all the races. So\nHenery and Scotty they have a fair go round the park while both their\nbosses is at church, and Henery beat him out o' sight--fair lost\nhim--and so Henery was reckoned the boss of the road. No one would take\nhim on after that.”\n\nA nasty creek-crossing here required Alfred's attention. A little girl,\ncarrying a billy-can of water, stood by the stepping stones, and smiled\nshyly as we passed. Alfred waved her a salute quite as though he were an\nordinary human being. I felt comforted. He had his moments of relaxation\nevidently, and his affections like other people.\n\n“What happened to Henry and the ninety-horse machine?” I asked. “And\nwhere does the elephant come in?”\n\nAlfred smiled pityingly.\n\n“Ain't I tellin' yer,” he said. “You wouldn't understand if I didn't\ntell yer how he got the car and all that. So here's Henery,” he went on,\n“with old John Bull goin' about in the fastest car in Australia, and\nold John, he's a quiet old geezer, that wouldn't drive faster than the\nregulations for anything, and that short-sighted he can't see to\nthe side of the road. So what does Henery do? He fixes up the\nspeed-indicator--puts a new face on it, so that when the car is doing\nthirty, the indicator only shows fifteen, and twenty for forty, and so\non. So out they'd go, and if Henery knew there was a big car in front of\nhim, he'd let out to forty-five, and the pace would very near blow\nthe whiskers off old John; and every now and again he'd look at the\nindicator, and it'd be showin' twenty-two and a half, and he'd say:\n\n“'Better be careful, Henery, you're slightly exceedin' the speed limit;\ntwenty miles an hour, you know, Henery, should be fast enough for\nanybody, and you're doing over twenty-two.'\n\n“Well, one day, Henery told me, he was tryin' to catch up a big car that\njust came out from France, and it had a half-hour start of him, and he\nwas just fairly flyin', and there was a lot of cars on the road, and he\nflies past 'em so fast the old man says, 'It's very strange, Henery,'\nhe says, 'that all the cars that are out to-day are comin' this way,' he\nsays. You see he was passin' 'em so fast he thought they were all comin'\ntowards him.\n\n“And Henery sees a mate of his comin', so he lets out a notch or two,\nand the two cars flew by each other like chain lightnin'. They were each\ndoin' about forty, and the old man, he says, 'There's a driver must be\ntravellin' a hundred miles an hour,' he says. 'I never see a car go by\nso fast in my life,' he says. 'If I could find out who he is, I'd report\nhim,' he says. 'Did you know the car, Henery?' But of course Henery, he\ndoesn't know, so on they goes.\n\n“The owner of the big French car thinks he has the fastest car in\nAustralia, and when he sees Henery and the old man coming, he tells his\ndriver to let her out a little; but Henery gives the ninety-horse the\nfull of the lever, and whips up alongside in one jump. And then he keeps\nthere just half a length ahead of him, tormentin' him like. And the\nowner of the French car he yells out to old John Bull, 'You're going\na nice pace for an old 'un,' he says. Old John has a blink down at\nthe indicator. 'We're doing twenty-five,' he yells out. 'Twenty-five\ngrandmothers,' says the bloke; but Henery he put on his accelerator, and\nleft him. It wouldn't do to let the old man get wise to it, you know.”\n\nWe topped a big hill, and Alfred cut off the engine and let the car\nswoop, as swiftly and noiselessly as an eagle, down to the flat country\nbelow.\n\n“You're a long while coming to the elephant, Alfred,” I said.\n\n“Well, now, I'll tell you about the elephant,” said Alfred, letting his\nclutch in again, and taking up the story to the accompaniment of the\nrhythmic throb of the engine.\n\n“One day Henery and the old man were going out a long trip over the\nmountain, and down the Kangaroo Valley Road that's all cut out of the\nside of the 'ill. And after they's gone a mile or two, Henery sees a\ntrack in the road--the track of the biggest car he ever seen or 'eard\nof. An' the more he looks at it, the more he reckons he must ketch that\ncar and see what she's made of. So he slows down passin' two yokels on\nthe road, and he says, 'Did you see a big car along 'ere?'\n\n“'Yes, we did,' they says.\n\n“'How big is she?' says Henery.\n\n“'Biggest car ever we see,' says the yokels, and they laughed that silly\nway these yokels always does.\n\n“'How many horse-power do you think she was?' says Henery.\n\n“'Horse-power,' they says; 'elephant-power, you mean! She was three\nelephant-power,' they says; and they goes 'Haw, haw!' and Henery drops\nhis clutch in, and off he goes after that car.”\n\nAlfred lit another cigarette as a preliminary to the climax.\n\n“So they run for miles, and all the time there's the track ahead of 'em,\nand Henery keeps lettin' her out, thinkin' that he'll never ketch that\ncar. They went through a town so fast, the old man he says, 'What house\nwas that we just passed,' he says. At last they come to the top of the\nbig 'ill, and there's the tracks of the big car goin' straight down\nahead of 'em.\n\n“D'you know that road? It's all cut out of the side of the mountain, and\nthere's places where if she was to side-slip you'd go down 'undreds\nof thousands of feet. And there's sharp turns, too; but the surface is\ngood, so Henery he lets her out, and down they go, whizzin' round the\nturns and skatin' out near the edge, and the old cove sittin' there\nenjoyin' it, never knowin' the danger. And comin' to one turn Henery\ngives a toot on the 'orn, and then he heard somethin' go 'toot, toot'\nright away down the mountain.\n\n“'Bout a mile ahead it seemed to be, and Henery reckoned he'd go another\nfour miles before he'd ketch it, so he chances them turns more than\never. And she was pretty hot, too; but he kept her at it, and he hadn't\ngone a full mile till he come round a turn about forty miles an hour,\nand before he could stop he run right into it, and wot do you think it\nwas?”\n\nI hadn't the faintest idea.\n\n“A circus. One of them travellin' circuses, goin' down the coast; and\none of the elephants had sore feet, so they put him in a big waggon,\nand another elephant pulled in front and one pushed behind. Three\nelephant-power it was, right enough. That was the waggon wot made the\nbig track. Well, it was all done so sudden. Before Henery could stop, he\nruns the radiator--very near boiling she was--up against the elephant's\ntail, and prints the pattern of the latest honeycomb radiator on the\nelephant as clear as if you done it with a stencil.\n\n“The elephant, he lets a roar out of him like one of them bulls\nbellerin', and he puts out his nose and ketches Henery round the neck,\nand yanks him out of the car, and chucks him right clean over the cliff,\n'bout a thousand feet. But he never done nothin' to the old bloke.”\n\n“Good gracious!”\n\n“Well, it finished Henery, killed him stone dead, of course, and the old\nman he was terrible cut up over losin' such a steady, trustworthy man.\n'Never get another like him,' he says.”\n\nWe were nearly at our journey's end, and we turned through a gate\ninto the home paddocks. Some young stock, both horses and cattle, came\nfrisking and cantering after the car, and the rough bush track took\nall Alfred's attention. We crossed a creek, the water swishing from the\nwheels, and began the long pull up to the homestead. Over the clamour of\nthe little-used second speed, Alfred concluded his narrative.\n\n“The old bloke advertised,” he said, “for another driver, a steady,\nreliable man to drive a twenty horse-power, four-cylinder touring car.\nEvery driver in Sydney put in for it. Nothing like a fast car to fetch\n'em, you know. And Scotty got it. Him wot used to drive the Napier I was\ntellin' you about.”\n\n“And what did the old man say when he found he'd been running a racing\ncar?”\n\n“He don't know now. Scotty never told 'im. Why should he? He's drivin'\nabout the country now, the boss of the roads, but he won't chance\nher near a circus. Thinks he might bump the same elephant. And that\nelephant, every time he smells a car passin' in the road, he goes near\nmad with fright. If he ever sees that car again, do you think he'd know\nit?”\n\nNot being used to elephants, I could not offer an opinion.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ORACLE\n\n\nNo tram ever goes to Randwick races without him; he is always fat,\nhairy, and assertive; he is generally one of a party, and takes the\ncentre of the stage all the time--collects and hands over the fares,\nadjusts the change, chaffs the conductor, crushes the thin, apologetic\nstranger next him into a pulp, and talks to the whole compartment as if\nthey had asked for his opinion.\n\nHe knows all the trainers and owners, or takes care to give the\nimpression that he does. He slowly and pompously hauls out his\nrace book, and one of his satellites opens the ball by saying, in a\ndeferential way:\n\n“What do you like for the 'urdles, Charley?”\n\nThe Oracle looks at the book and breathes heavily; no one else ventures\nto speak.\n\n“Well,” he says, at last, “of course there's only one in it--if he's\nwanted. But that's it--will they spin him? I don't think they will.\nThey's only a lot o' cuddies, any'ow.”\n\nNo one likes to expose his own ignorance by asking which horse he refers\nto as the “only one in it”; and the Oracle goes on to deal out some more\nwisdom in a loud voice.\n\n“Billy K---- told me” (he probably hardly knows Billy K---- by sight)\n“Billy K---- told me that that bay 'orse ran the best mile-an'-a-half\never done on Randwick yesterday; but I don't give him a chance, for all\nthat; that's the worst of these trainers. They don't know when their\nhorses are well--half of 'em.”\n\nThen a voice comes from behind him. It is that of the thin man, who is\ncrushed out of sight by the bulk of the Oracle.\n\n“I think,” says the thin man, “that that horse of Flannery's ought to\nrun well in the Handicap.”\n\nThe Oracle can't stand this sort of thing at all. He gives a snort,\nwheels half-round and looks at the speaker. Then he turns back to the\ncompartment full of people, and says: “No 'ope.”\n\nThe thin man makes a last effort. “Well, they backed him last night,\nanyhow.”\n\n“Who backed 'im?” says the Oracle.\n\n“In Tattersall's,” says the thin man.\n\n“I'm sure,” says the Oracle; and the thin man collapses.\n\nOn arrival at the course, the Oracle is in great form. Attended by\nhis string of satellites, he plods from stall to stall staring at the\nhorses. Their names are printed in big letters on the stalls, but the\nOracle doesn't let that stop his display of knowledge.\n\n“'Ere's Blue Fire,” he says, stopping at that animal's stall, and\nswinging his race book. “Good old Blue Fire!” he goes on loudly, as a\nlittle court collects. “Jimmy B----” (mentioning a popular jockey) “told\nme he couldn't have lost on Saturday week if he had only been ridden\ndifferent. I had a good stake on him, too, that day. Lor', the races\nthat has been chucked away on this horse. They will not ride him right.”\n\nA trainer who is standing by, civilly interposes. “This isn't Blue\nFire,” he says. “Blue Fire's out walking about. This is a two-year-old\nfilly that's in the stall----”\n\n“Well, I can see that, can't I,” says the Oracle, crushingly. “You\ndon't suppose I thought Blue Fire was a mare, did you?” and he moves off\nhurriedly.\n\n“Now, look here, you chaps,” he says to his followers at last. “You wait\nhere. I want to go and see a few of the talent, and it don't do to have\na crowd with you. There's Jimmy M---- over there now” (pointing to a\nleading trainer). “I'll get hold of him in a minute. He couldn't tell me\nanything with so many about. Just you wait here.”\n\nHe crushes into a crowd that has gathered round the favourite's stall,\nand overhears one hard-faced racing man say to another, “What do you\nlike?” to which the other answers, “Well, either this or Royal Scot. I\nthink I'll put a bit on Royal Scot.” This is enough for the Oracle. He\ndoesn't know either of the men from Adam, or either of the horses from\nthe great original pachyderm, but the information will do to go on with.\nHe rejoins his followers, and looks very mysterious.\n\n“Well, did you hear anything?” they say.\n\nThe Oracle talks low and confidentially.\n\n“The crowd that have got the favourite tell me they're not afraid of\nanything but Royal Scot,” he says. “I think we'd better put a bit on\nboth.”\n\n“What did the Royal Scot crowd say?” asks an admirer deferentially.\n\n“Oh, they're going to try and win. I saw the stable commissioner, and he\ntold me they were going to put a hundred on him. Of course, you\nneedn't say I told you, 'cause I promised him I wouldn't tell.” And\nthe satellites beam with admiration of the Oracle, and think what a\nprivilege it is to go to the races with such a knowing man.\n\nThey contribute their mites to the general fund, some putting in a\npound, others half a sovereign, and the Oracle takes it into the ring to\ninvest, half on the favourite and half on Royal Scot. He finds that the\nfavourite is at two to one, and Royal Scot at threes, eight to one\nbeing offered against anything else. As he ploughs through the ring, a\nWhisperer (one of those broken-down followers of the turf who get\ntheir living in various mysterious ways, but partly by giving “tips” to\nbackers) pulls his sleeve.\n\n“What are you backing?” he says.\n\n“Favourite and Royal Scot,” says the Oracle.\n\n“Put a pound on Bendemeer,” says the tipster. “It's a certainty. Meet\nme here if it comes off, and I'll tell you something for the next race.\nDon't miss it now. Get on quick!”\n\nThe Oracle is humble enough before the hanger-on of the turf. A\nbookmaker roars “10 to 1 Bendemeer;” he suddenly fishes out a sovereign\nof his own--and he hasn't money to spare, for all his knowingness--and\nputs it on Bendemeer. His friends' money he puts on the favourite and\nRoyal Scot as arranged. Then they all go round to watch the race.\n\nThe horses are at the post; a distant cluster of crowded animals with\nlittle dots of colour on their backs. Green, blue, yellow, purple,\nFrench grey, and old gold, they change about in a bewildering manner,\nand though the Oracle has a cheap pair of glasses, he can't make out\nwhere Bendemeer has got to. Royal Scot and the favourite he has lost\ninterest in, and secretly hopes that they will be left at the post\nor break their necks; but he does not confide his sentiment to his\ncompanions.\n\nThey're off! The long line of colours across the track becomes a\nshapeless clump and then draws out into a long string. “What's that in\nfront?” yells someone at the rails. “Oh, that thing of Hart's,” says\nsomeone else. But the Oracle hears them not; he is looking in the mass\nof colour for a purple cap and grey jacket, with black arm bands. He\ncannot see it anywhere, and the confused and confusing mass swings round\nthe turn into the straight.\n\nThen there is a babel of voices, and suddenly a shout of “Bendemeer!\nBendemeer!” and the Oracle, without knowing which is Bendemeer, takes\nup the cry feverishly. “Bendemeer! Bendemeer!” he yells, waggling his\nglasses about, trying to see where the animal is.\n\n“Where's Royal Scot, Charley? Where's Royal Scot?” screams one of his\nfriends, in agony. “'Ow's he doin'?”\n\n“No 'ope!” says the Oracle, with fiendish glee. “Bendemeer! Bendemeer!”\n\nThe horses are at the Leger stand now, whips are out, and three horses\nseem to be nearly abreast; in fact, to the Oracle there seem to be a\ndozen nearly abreast. Then a big chestnut sticks his head in front\nof the others, and a small man at the Oracle's side emits a deafening\nseries of yells right by the Oracle's ear:\n\n“Go on, Jimmy! Rub it into him! Belt him! It's a cake-walk! A cake-walk!”\n The big chestnut, in a dogged sort of way, seems to stick his body clear\nof his opponents, and passes the post a winner by a length. The Oracle\ndoesn't know what has won, but fumbles with his book. The number on the\nsaddle-cloth catches his eye--No. 7; he looks hurriedly down the page.\nNo. 7--Royal Scot. Second is No. 24--Bendemeer. Favourite nowhere.\n\nHardly has he realised it, before his friends are cheering and clapping\nhim on the back. “By George, Charley, it takes you to pick 'em.” “Come\nand 'ave a wet!” “You 'ad a quid in, didn't you, Charley?” The Oracle\nfeels very sick at having missed the winner, but he dies game. “Yes,\nrather; I had a quid on,” he says. “And” (here he nerves himself to\nsmile) “I had a saver on the second, too.”\n\nHis comrades gasp with astonishment. “D'you hear that, eh? Charley\nbacked first and second. That's pickin' 'em if you like.” They have a\nwet, and pour fulsome adulation on the Oracle when he collects their\nmoney.\n\nAfter the Oracle has collected the winnings for his friends he meets the\nWhisperer again.\n\n“It didn't win?” he says to the Whisperer in inquiring tones.\n\n“Didn't win,” says the Whisperer, who has determined to brazen the\nmatter out. “How could he win? Did you see the way he was ridden? That\nhorse was stiffened just after I seen you, and he never tried a yard.\nDid you see the way he was pulled and hauled about at the turn? It'd\nmake a man sick. What was the stipendiary stewards doing, I wonder?”\n\nThis fills the Oracle with a new idea. All that he remembers of the race\nat the turn was a jumble of colours, a kaleidoscope of horses and of\nriders hanging on to the horses' necks. But it wouldn't do to admit that\nhe didn't see everything, and didn't know everything; so he plunges in\nboldly.\n\n“O' course I saw it,” he says. “And a blind man could see it. They ought\nto rub him out.”\n\n“Course they ought,” says the Whisperer. “But, look here, put two quid\non Tell-tale; you'll get it all back!”\n\nThe Oracle does put on “two quid”, and doesn't get it all back. Neither\ndoes he see any more of this race than he did of the last one--in fact,\nhe cheers wildly when the wrong horse is coming in. But when the public\nbegin to hoot he hoots as loudly as anybody--louder if anything; and all\nthe way home in the tram he lays down the law about stiff running, and\nwants to know what the stipendiaries are doing.\n\nIf you go into any barber's shop, you can hear him at it, and he\nflourishes in suburban railway carriages; but he has a tremendous local\nreputation, having picked first and second in the handicap, and it would\nbe a bold man who would venture to question the Oracle's knowledge of\nracing and of all matters relating to it.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CAST-IRON CANVASSER\n\n\nThe firm of Sloper and Dodge, publishers and printers, was in great\ndistress. These two enterprising individuals had worked up an enormous\nbusiness in time-payment books, which they sold all over Australia\nby means of canvassers. They had put all the money they had into the\nbusiness; and now, just when everything was in thorough working order,\nthe public had revolted against them.\n\nTheir canvassers were molested by the country folk in divers strange\nbush ways. One was made drunk, and then a two-horse harrow was run over\nhim; another was decoyed into the ranges on pretence of being shown a\ngold-mine, and his guide galloped away and left him to freeze all night\nin the bush. In mining localities the inhabitants were called together\nby beating a camp-oven lid with a pick, and the canvasser was given ten\nminutes in which to get out of the town alive. If he disregarded the\nhint he would, as likely as not, fall accidentally down a disused shaft.\n\nThe people of one district applied to their M.P. to have canvassers\nbrought under the “Noxious Animals Act”, and demanded that a reward\nshould be offered for their scalps. Reports appeared in the country\npress about strange, gigantic birds that appeared at remote selections\nand frightened the inhabitants to death--these were Sloper and Dodge's\nsober and reliable agents, wearing neat, close-fitting suits of tar and\nfeathers.\n\nIn fact, it was altogether too hot for the canvassers, and they came\nin from North and West and South, crippled and disheartened, to tender\ntheir resignations. To make matters worse, Sloper and Dodge had just\ngot out a large Atlas of Australasia, and if they couldn't sell it, ruin\nstared them in the face; and how could they sell it without canvassers?\n\nThe members of the firm sat in their private office. Sloper was a long,\nsanctimonious individual, very religious and very bald. Dodge was a\nlittle, fat American, with bristly, black hair and beard, and quick,\nbeady eyes. He was eternally smoking a reeking black pipe, and puffing\nthe smoke through his nose in great whiffs, like a locomotive on a\nsteep grade. Anybody walking into one of those whiffs was liable to get\nparalysis.\n\nJust as things were at their very blackest, something had turned up that\npromised to relieve all their difficulties. An inventor had offered to\nsupply them with a patent cast-iron canvasser--a figure which (he said)\nwhen wound up would walk, talk, collect orders, and stand any amount\nof ill-usage and wear and tear. If this could indeed be done, they\nwere saved. They had made an appointment with the genius; but he was\nhalf-an-hour late, and the partners were steeped in gloom.\n\nThey had begun to despair of his appearing at all, when a cab rattled up\nto the door. Sloper and Dodge rushed unanimously to the window. A\nyoung man, very badly dressed, stepped out of the cab, holding over\nhis shoulder what looked like the upper half of a man's body. In his\ndisengaged hand he held a pair of human legs with boots and trousers on.\nThus burdened he turned to ask his fare, but the cabman gave a yell of\nterror, whipped up his horse, and disappeared at a hand-gallop; and a\nwoman who happened to be going by, ran down the street, howling that\nJack the Ripper had come to town. The man bolted in at the door, and\ntoiled up the dark stairs tramping heavily, the legs and feet, which he\ndragged after him, making an unearthly clatter. He came in and put his\nburden down on the sofa.\n\n“There you are, gents,” he said; “there's your canvasser.”\n\nSloper and Dodge recoiled in horror. The upper part of the man had a\nwaxy face, dull, fishy eyes, and dark hair; he lounged on the sofa like\na corpse at ease, while his legs and feet stood by, leaning stiffly\nagainst the wall. The partners gazed at him for a while in silence.\n\n“Fix him together, for God's sake,” said Dodge. “He looks awful.”\n\nThe Genius grinned, and fixed the legs on.\n\n“Now he looks better,” said Dodge, poking about the figure--“looks\nas much like life as most--ah, would you, you brute!” he exclaimed,\nspringing back in alarm, for the figure had made a violent La Blanche\nswing at him.\n\n“That's all right,” said the Inventor. “It's no good having his face\nknocked about, you know--lot of trouble to make that face. His head and\nbody are full of springs, and if anybody hits him in the face, or in the\npit of the stomach--favourite places to hit canvassers, the pit of the\nstomach--it sets a strong spring in motion, and he fetches his right\nhand round with a swipe that'll knock them into the middle of next week.\nIt's an awful hit. Griffo couldn't dodge it, and Slavin couldn't stand\nup against it. No fear of any man hitting _him_ twice.\n\n“And he's dog-proof, too. His legs are padded with tar and oakum, and\nif a dog bites a bit out of him, it will take that dog weeks to pick his\nteeth clean. Never bite anybody again, that dog won't. And he'll talk,\ntalk, talk, like a suffragist gone mad; his phonograph can be charged\nfor 100,000 words, and all you've got to do is to speak into it what you\nwant him to say, and he'll say it. He'll go on saying it till he talks\nhis man silly, or gets an order. He has an order-form in his hand, and\nas soon as anyone signs it and gives it back to him, that sets another\nspring in motion, and he puts the order in his pocket, turns round, and\nwalks away. Grand idea, isn't he? Lor' bless you, I fairly love him.”\n\nHe beamed affectionately on his monster.\n\n“What about stairs?” said Dodge.\n\n“No stairs in the bush,” said the Inventor, blowing a speck of dust off\nhis apparition; “all ground-floor houses. Anyhow, if there were stairs\nwe could carry him up and let him fall down afterwards, or get flung\ndown like any other canvasser.”\n\n“Ha! Let's see him walk,” said Dodge.\n\nThe figure walked all right, stiff and erect.\n\n“Now let's hear him yabber.”\n\nThe Genius touched a spring, and instantly, in a queer, tin-whistly\nvoice, he began to sing, “Little Annie Rooney”.\n\n“Good!” said Dodge; “he'll do. We'll give you your price. Leave him here\nto-night, and come in to-morrow. We'll send you off to the back country\nwith him. Ninemile would be a good place to start in. Have a cigar?”\n\nMr. Dodge, much elated, sucked at his pipe, and blew through his nose a\ncloud of nearly solid smoke, through which the Genius sidled out. They\ncould hear him sneezing and choking all the way down the stairs.\n\nNinemile is a quiet little place, sleepy beyond description. When the\nmosquitoes in that town settle on anyone, they usually go to sleep, and\nforget to bite him. The climate is so hot that the very grasshoppers\ncrawl into the hotel parlours out of the sun, climb up the window\ncurtains, and then go to sleep. The Riot Act never had to be read in\nNinemile. The only thing that can arouse the inhabitants out of their\nlethargy is the prospect of a drink at somebody else's expense.\n\nFor these reasons it had been decided to start the Cast-iron Canvasser\nthere, and then move him on to more populous and active localities if he\nproved a success. They sent up the Genius, and one of their men who knew\nthe district well. The Genius was to manage the automaton, and the other\nwas to lay out the campaign, choose the victims, and collect the money,\ngeniuses being notoriously unreliable and loose in their cash. They got\nthrough a good deal of whisky on the way up, and when they arrived at\nNinemile were in a cheerful mood, and disposed to take risks.\n\n“Who'll we begin on?” said the Genius.\n\n“Oh, hang it all,” said the other, “let's make a start with Macpherson.”\n\nMacpherson was a Land Agent, and the big bug of the place. He was a\ngigantic Scotchman, six feet four in his socks, and freckled all over\nwith freckles as big as half-crowns. His eyebrows would have made\ndecent-sized moustaches for a cavalryman, and his moustaches looked like\nhorns. He was a fighter from the ground up, and had a desperate “down”\n on canvassers generally, and on Sloper and Dodge's canvassers in\nparticular.\n\nSloper and Dodge had published a book called “Remarkable Colonials”, and\nMacpherson had written out his own biography for it. He was intensely\nproud of his pedigree and his relations, and in his narrative made out\nthat he was descended from the original Fhairshon who swam round Noah's\nArk with his title-deeds in his teeth. He showed how his people had\nfought under Alexander the Great and Timour, and had come over to\nScotland some centuries before William the Conqueror landed in England.\nHe proved that he was related in a general way to one emperor, fifteen\nkings, twenty-five dukes, and earls and lords and viscounts innumerable.\nAnd then, after all, the editor of “Remarkable Colonials” managed to mix\nhim up with some other fellow, some low-bred Irish McPherson, born in\nDublin of poor but honest parents.\n\nIt was a terrible outrage. Macpherson became president of the Western\nDistrict Branch of the “Remarkable Colonials” Defence League, a fierce\nand homicidal association got up to resist, legally and otherwise,\npaying for the book. He had further sworn by all he held sacred that\nevery canvasser who came to harry him in future should die, and had put\nup a notice on his office-door, “Canvassers come in at their own risk.”\n\nHe had a dog of what he called the Hold'em breed, who could tell a\ncanvasser by his walk, and would go for him on sight. The reader will\nunderstand, therefore, that, when the Genius and his mate proposed to\nstart on Macpherson, they were laying out a capacious contract for\nthe Cast-iron Canvasser, and could only have been inspired by a morbid\ncraving for excitement, aided by the influence of backblock whisky.\n\nThe Inventor wound the figure up in the back parlour of the pub. There\nwere a frightful lot of screws to tighten before the thing would work,\nbut at last he said it was ready, and they shambled off down the street,\nthe figure marching stiffly between them. It had a book tucked under\nits arm and an order-form in its hand. When they arrived opposite\nMacpherson's office, the Genius started the phonograph working, pointed\nthe figure straight at Macpherson's door, and set it going. Then the two\nconspirators waited, like Guy Fawkes in his cellar.\n\nThe automaton marched across the road and in at the open door, talking\nto itself loudly in a hoarse, unnatural voice.\n\nMacpherson was writing at his table, and looked up.\n\nThe figure walked bang through a small collection of flower-pots, sent\na chair flying, tramped heavily in the spittoon, and then brought up\nagainst the table with a loud crash and stood still. It was talking all\nthe time.\n\n“I have here,” it said, “a most valuable work, an Atlas of Australia,\nwhich I desire to submit to your notice. The large and increasing demand\nof bush residents for time-payment works has induced the publishers of\nthis----”\n\n“My God!” said Macpherson, “it's a canvasser. Here, Tom Sayers, Tom\nSayers!” and he whistled and called for his dog. “Now,” he said, “will\nyou go out of this office quietly, or will you be thrown out? It's for\nyourself to decide, but you've only got while a duck wags his tail to\ndecide in. Which'll it be?”\n\n“---- works of modern ages,” said the canvasser. “Every person\nsubscribing to this invaluable work will receive, in addition, a\nflat-iron, a railway pass for a year, and a pocket-compass. If you will\nplease sign this order----”\n\nJust here Tom Sayers came tearing through the office, and without\nwaiting for orders hitched straight on to the canvasser's calf. To\nMacpherson's amazement the piece came clear away, and Tom Sayers rolled\nabout on the floor with his mouth full of a sticky substance which\nseemed to surprise him badly.\n\nThe long Scotchman paused awhile before this mystery, but at last\nhe fancied he had got the solution. “Got a cork leg, have you?” said\nhe--“Well, let's see if your ribs are cork too,” and he struck the\ncanvasser an awful blow on the fifth button of the waistcoat.\n\nQuicker than lightning came that terrific right-hand cross-counter.\nMacpherson never even knew what happened to him. The canvasser's right\nhand, which had been adjusted by his inventor for a high blow, had\nlanded on the butt of Macpherson's ear and dropped him like a fowl. The\ngasping, terrified bull-dog fled the scene, and the canvasser stood over\nhis fallen foe, still intoning the virtues of his publication. He had\ncome there merely as a friend, he said, to give the inhabitants of\nNinemile a chance to buy a book which had recently earned the approval\nof King O'Malley and His Excellency the Governor-General.\n\nThe Genius and his mate watched this extraordinary drama through the\nwindow. The stimulant habitually consumed by the Ninemilers had induced\nin them a state of superlative Dutch courage, and they looked upon the\nwhole affair as a wildly hilarious joke.\n\n“By Gad! he's done him,” said the Genius, as Macpherson went down, “done\nhim in one hit. If he don't pay as a canvasser I'll take him to town\nand back him to fight Les Darcy. Look out for yourself; don't you handle\nhim!” he continued as the other approached the figure. “Leave him to\nme. As like as not, if you get fooling about him, he'll give you a clout\nthat'll paralyse you.”\n\nSo saying, he guided the automaton out of the office and into the\nstreet, and walked straight into a policeman.\n\nBy a common impulse the Genius and his mate ran rapidly away in\ndifferent directions, leaving the figure alone with the officer.\n\nHe was a fully-ordained sergeant--by name Aloysius O'Grady; a squat,\nrosy little Irishman. He hated violent arrests and all that sort of\nthing, and had a faculty of persuading drunks and disorderlies and other\nfractious persons to “go quietly along wid him,” that was little short\nof marvellous. Excited revellers, who were being carried by their mates,\nstruggling violently, would break away to prance gaily along to the\nlock-up with the sergeant. Obstinate drunks who had done nothing but lie\non the ground and kick their feet in the air, would get up like birds,\nserpent-charmed, to go with him to durance vile.\n\nAs soon as he saw the canvasser, and noted his fixed, unearthly stare,\nand listened to his hoarse, unnatural voice, the sergeant knew what was\nthe matter; it was a man in the horrors, a common enough spectacle at\nNinemile. He resolved to decoy him into the lock-up, and accosted him in\na friendly, free-and-easy way.\n\n“Good day t'ye,” he said.\n\n“---- most magnificent volume ever published, jewelled in fourteen\nholes, working on a ruby roller, and in a glass case,” said the\nbook-canvasser. “The likenesses of the historical personages are\nso natural that the book must not be left open on the table, or the\nmosquitoes will ruin it by stinging the portraits.”\n\nIt then dawned on the sergeant that this was no mere case of the\nhorrors--he was dealing with a book-canvasser.\n\n“Ah, sure,” he said, “fwhat's the use uv tryin' to sell books at all, at\nall; folks does be peltin' them out into the street, and the nanny-goats\nlives on them these times. Oi send the childer out to pick 'em up, and\nwe have 'em at me place in barrow-loads. Come along wid me now, and\nOi'll make you nice and comfortable for the night,” and he laid his hand\non the outstretched palm of the figure.\n\nIt was a fatal mistake. He had set in motion the machinery which\noperated the figure's left arm, and it moved that limb in towards its\nbody, and hugged the sergeant to its breast, with a vice-like grip. Then\nit started in a faltering and uneven, but dogged, way to walk towards\nthe river.\n\n“Immortial Saints!” gasped the sergeant, “he's squazin' the livin'\nbreath out uv me. Lave go now loike a dacent sowl, lave go. And oh,\nfor the love uv God, don't be shpakin' into me ear that way;” for the\nfigure's mouth was pressed tight against the sergeant's ear, and its\nawful voice went through and through the little man's head, as it held\nforth about the volume. The sergeant struggled violently, and by so\ndoing set some more springs in motion, and the figure's right arm\nmade terrific swipes in the air. A following of boys and loafers had\ncollected by this time. “Blimey, how does he lash out!” was the remark\nthey made. But they didn't interfere, notwithstanding the sergeant's\nfrantic appeals, and things were going hard with him when his\nsubordinate, Constable Dooley, appeared on the scene.\n\nDooley, better known as The Wombat because of his sleepy disposition,\nwas a man of great strength. He had originally been quartered at Sydney,\nand had fought many bitter battles with the notorious “pushes” of Bondi,\nSurry Hills and The Rocks. After that, duty at Ninemile was child's\nplay, and he never ran in fewer than two drunks at a time; it was\nbeneath his dignity to be seen capturing a solitary inebriate. If they\nwouldn't come any other way, he would take them by the ankles and drag\nthem after him. When the Wombat saw the sergeant in the grasp of an\ninebriate he bore down on the fray full of fight.\n\n“I'll soon make him lave go, sergeant,” he said, and he caught hold of\nthe figure's right arm, to put on the “police twist”. Unfortunately,\nat that exact moment the sergeant touched one of the springs in the\ncreature's breast. With the suddenness and severity of a horse-kick, it\nlashed out with its right hand, catching the redoubtable Dooley a thud\non the jaw, and sending him to grass as if he had been shot.\n\nFor a few minutes he “lay as only dead men lie”. Then he got up bit by\nbit, wandered off home to the police-barracks, and mentioned casually\nto his wife that John L. Sullivan had come to town, and had taken\nthe sergeant away to drown him. After which, having given orders that\nanybody who called was to be told that he had gone fifteen miles out of\ntown to serve a summons on a man for not registering a dog, he locked\nhimself up in a cell for the rest of the day.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cast-iron Canvasser, still holding the sergeant tightly\nclutched to its breast, was marching straight towards the river.\nSomething had disorganised its vocal arrangements, and it was now\npositively shrieking in the sergeant's ear, and, as it yelled, the\nlittle man yelled still louder.\n\n“Oi don't want yer accursed book. Lave go uv me, Oi say!” He beat with\nhis fists on its face, and kicked its shins without avail. A short,\nstaggering rush, a wild shriek from the officer, and they both toppled\nover the steep bank and went souse into the depths of Ninemile Creek.\n\nThat was the end of the matter. The Genius and his mate returned to town\nhurriedly, and lay low, expecting to be indicted for murder. Constable\nDooley drew up a report for the Chief of Police which contained so many\nstrange statements that the Police department concluded the sergeant\nmust have got drunk and drowned himself, and that Dooley saw him do it,\nbut was too drunk to pull him out.\n\nAnyone unacquainted with Ninemile might expect that a report of the\noccurrence would have reached the Sydney papers. As a matter of fact the\nstorekeeper did think of writing one, but decided that it was too much\ntrouble. There was some idea of asking the Government to fish the two\nbodies out of the river; but about that time an agitation was started\nin Ninemile to have the Federal Capital located there, and nothing else\nmattered.\n\nThe Genius discovered a pub in Sydney that kept the Ninemile brand of\nwhisky, and drank himself to death; the Wombat became a Sub-Inspector of\nPolice; Sloper entered the Christian ministry; Dodge was elected to the\nFederal Parliament; and a vague tradition about “a bloke who came up\nhere in the horrors, and drownded poor old O'Grady,” is the only memory\nthat remains of that wonderful creation, the Cast-iron Canvasser.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MERINO SHEEP\n\n\nPeople have got the impression that the merino is a gentle, bleating\nanimal that gets its living without trouble to anybody, and comes up\nevery year to be shorn with a pleased smile upon its amiable face. It is\nmy purpose here to exhibit the merino sheep in its true light.\n\nFirst let us give him his due. No one can accuse him of being a\nferocious animal. No one could ever say that a sheep attacked him\nwithout provocation; although there is an old bush story of a man who\nwas discovered in the act of killing a neighbour's wether.\n\n“Hello!” said the neighbour, “What's this? Killing my sheep! What have\nyou got to say for yourself?”\n\n“Yes,” said the man, with an air of virtuous indignation. “I _am_ killing\nyour sheep. I'll kill _any_ man's sheep that bites _me_!”\n\nBut as a rule the merino refrains from using his teeth on people. He\ngoes to work in another way.\n\nThe truth is that he is a dangerous monomaniac, and his one idea is to\nruin the man who owns him. With this object in view he will display a\ntalent for getting into trouble and a genius for dying that are almost\nincredible.\n\nIf a mob of sheep see a bush fire closing round them, do they run away\nout of danger? Not at all, they rush round and round in a ring till the\nfire burns them up. If they are in a river-bed, with a howling flood\ncoming down, they will stubbornly refuse to cross three inches of water\nto save themselves. Dogs may bark and men may shriek, but the sheep\nwon't move. They will wait there till the flood comes and drowns them\nall, and then their corpses go down the river on their backs with their\nfeet in the air.\n\nA mob will crawl along a road slowly enough to exasperate a snail, but\nlet a lamb get away in a bit of rough country, and a racehorse can't\nhead him back again. If sheep are put into a big paddock with water in\nthree corners of it, they will resolutely crowd into the fourth, and die\nof thirst.\n\nWhen being counted out at a gate, if a scrap of bark be left on the\nground in the gateway, they will refuse to step over it until dogs and\nmen have sweated and toiled and sworn and “heeled 'em up”, and “spoke\nto 'em”, and fairly jammed them at it. At last one will gather courage,\nrush at the fancied obstacle, spring over it about six feet in the air,\nand dart away. The next does exactly the same, but jumps a bit higher.\nThen comes a rush of them following one another in wild bounds like\nantelopes, until one overjumps himself and alights on his head. This\nfrightens those still in the yard, and they stop running out.\n\nThen the dogging and shrieking and hustling and tearing have to be gone\nthrough all over again. (This on a red-hot day, mind you, with clouds\nof blinding dust about, the yolk of wool irritating your eyes, and,\nperhaps, three or four thousand sheep to put through). The delay throws\nout the man who is counting, and he forgets whether he left off at 45\nor 95. The dogs, meanwhile, have taken the first chance to slip over\nthe fence and hide in the shade somewhere, and then there are loud\nwhistlings and oaths, and calls for Rover and Bluey. At last a\ndirt-begrimed man jumps over the fence, unearths Bluey, and hauls him\nback by the ear. Bluey sets to work barking and heeling-'em up again,\nand pretends that he thoroughly enjoys it; but all the while he is\nlooking out for another chance to “clear”. And _this_ time he won't be\ndiscovered in a hurry.\n\nThere is a well-authenticated story of a ship-load of sheep that was\nlost because an old ram jumped overboard, and all the rest followed him.\nNo doubt they did, and were proud to do it. A sheep won't go through\nan open gate on his own responsibility, but he would gladly and proudly\n“follow the leader” through the red-hot portals of Hades: and it makes\nno difference whether the lead goes voluntarily, or is hauled struggling\nand kicking and fighting every inch of the way.\n\nFor pure, sodden stupidity there is no animal like the merino. A lamb\nwill follow a bullock-dray, drawn by sixteen bullocks and driven by\na profane person with a whip, under the impression that the aggregate\nmonstrosity is his mother. A ewe never knows her own lamb by sight, and\napparently has no sense of colour. She can recognise its voice half a\nmile off among a thousand other voices apparently exactly similar; but\nwhen she gets within five yards of it she starts to smell all the other\nlambs within reach, including the black ones--though her own may be\nwhite.\n\nThe fiendish resemblance which one sheep bears to another is a great\nadvantage to them in their struggles with their owners. It makes it more\ndifficult to draft them out of a strange flock, and much harder to tell\nwhen any are missing.\n\nConcerning this resemblance between sheep, there is a story told of\na fat old Murrumbidgee squatter who gave a big price for a famous ram\ncalled Sir Oliver. He took a friend out one day to inspect Sir Oliver,\nand overhauled that animal with a most impressive air of sheep-wisdom.\n\n“Look here,” he said, “at the fineness of the wool. See the serrations\nin each thread of it. See the density of it. Look at the way his legs\nand belly are clothed--he's wool all over, that sheep. Grand animal,\ngrand animal!”\n\nThen they went and had a drink, and the old squatter said, “Now, I'll\nshow you the difference between a champion ram and a second-rater.” So\nhe caught a ram and pointed out his defects. “See here--not half the\nserrations that other sheep had. No density of fleece to speak of.\nBare-bellied as a pig, compared with Sir Oliver. Not that this isn't\na fair sheep, but he'd be dear at one-tenth Sir Oliver's price. By the\nway, Johnson” (to his overseer), “what ram _is_ this?”\n\n“That, sir,” replied the astounded functionary--“that _is_ Sir Oliver,\nsir!”\n\nThere is another kind of sheep in Australia, as great a curse in his own\nway as the merino--namely, the cross-bred, or half-merino-half-Leicester\nanimal. The cross-bred will get through, under, or over any fence you\nlike to put in front of him. He is never satisfied with his owner's run,\nbut always thinks other people's runs must be better, so he sets off to\nexplore. He will strike a course, say, south-east, and so long as\nthe fit takes him he will keep going south-east through all\nobstacles--rivers, fences, growing crops, anything. The merino relies on\npassive resistance for his success; the cross-bred carries the war into\nthe enemy's camp, and becomes a living curse to his owner day and night.\n\nOnce there was a man who was induced in a weak moment to buy twenty\ncross-bred rams. From that hour the hand of Fate was upon him. They\ngot into all the paddocks they shouldn't have been in. They scattered\nthemselves over the run promiscuously. They visited the cultivation\npaddock and the vegetable-garden at their own sweet will. And then they\ntook to roving. In a body they visited the neighbouring stations, and\nplayed havoc with the sheep all over the district.\n\nThe wretched owner was constantly getting fiery letters from his\nneighbours: “Your blanky rams are here. Come and take them away at\nonce,” and he would have to go nine or ten miles to drive them home. Any\nman who has tried to drive rams on a hot day knows what purgatory is. He\nwas threatened every week with actions for trespass.\n\nHe tried shutting them up in the sheep-yard. They got out and went back\nto the garden. Then he gaoled them in the calf-pen. Out again and into\na growing crop. Then he set a boy to watch them; but the boy went to\nsleep, and they were four miles away across country before he got on to\ntheir tracks.\n\nAt length, when they happened accidentally to be at home on their\nowner's run, there came a big flood. His sheep, mostly merinos, had\nplenty of time to get on to high ground and save their lives; but, of\ncourse, they didn't, and were almost all drowned. The owner sat on a\nrise above the waste of waters and watched the dead animals go by. He\nwas a ruined man. But he said, “Thank God, those cross-bred rams are\ndrowned, anyhow.” Just as he spoke there was a splashing in the water,\nand the twenty rams solemnly swam ashore and ranged themselves in front\nof him. They were the only survivors of his twenty thousand sheep.\nHe broke down, and was taken to an asylum for insane paupers. The\ncross-breds had fulfilled their destiny.\n\nThe cross-bred drives his owner out of his mind, but the merino ruins\nhis man with greater celerity. Nothing on earth will kill cross-breds;\nnothing will keep merinos alive. If they are put on dry salt-bush\ncountry they die of drought. If they are put on damp, well-watered\ncountry they die of worms, fluke, and foot-rot. They die in the wet\nseasons and they die in the dry ones.\n\nThe hard, resentful look on the faces of all bushmen comes from a long\ncourse of dealing with merino sheep. The merino dominates the bush,\nand gives to Australian literature its melancholy tinge, its despairing\npathos. The poems about dying boundary-riders, and lonely graves under\nmournful she-oaks, are the direct outcome of the poet's too close\nassociation with that soul-destroying animal. A man who could write\nanything cheerful after a day in the drafting-yards would be a freak of\nnature.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BULLOCK\n\n\nThe typical Australian bullock--long-horned, sullen-eyed, stupid, and\nvindictive--is bred away out in Queensland, on remote stations in the\nNever Never land, where men live on damper and beef, and occasionally\neat a whole bottle of hot pickles at a sitting, simply to satisfy their\ncraving for vegetable food. Here, under the blazing tropic sun, among\nflies and dust and loneliness, they struggle with the bullock from\nyear's end to year's end. It is not to be supposed that they take up\nthis kind of thing for fun. The man who worked cattle for sport would\nwheel bricks for amusement.\n\nAt periodical intervals a boom in cattle-country arises in the cities,\nand syndicates are formed to take up country and stock it. It looks so\nbeautifully simple--_on paper_.\n\nYou get your country, thousands of miles of it, for next to nothing.\nYou buy your breeding herd for a ridiculously small sum, on long-dated\nbills. Your staff consists of a manager, who toils for a share of the\nprofits, a couple of half-civilized white stockmen at low wages, and\na handful of blacks, who work harder for a little opium ash than they\nwould for much money. Plant costs nothing, improvements nothing--no\nwoolshed is needed, there are no shearers to pay, and no carriage to\nmarket, for the bullock walks himself down to his doom. Granted that\nprices are low, still it is obvious that there must be huge profits in\nthe business. So the cattle start away out to “the country”, where they\nare supposed to increase and multiply, and enrich their owners. Alas!\nfor such hopes. There is a curse on cattle.\n\nNo one has ever been able to explain exactly how the deficit arises.\nPut the figures before the oldest and most experienced cattleman, and he\nwill fail to show why they don't work out right. And yet they never do.\nIt is not the fault of the cattle themselves. Sheep would rather die\nthan live--and when one comes to think of the life they lead, one can\neasily understand their preference for death; but cattle, if given half\na chance, will do their best to prolong their existence.\n\nIf they are running on low-lying country and are driven off when a flood\ncomes, they will probably walk back into the flood-water and get drowned\nas soon as their owner turns his back. But, as a rule, cattle are not\nsuicidal. They sort themselves into mobs, they pick out the best bits of\ncountry, they find their way to the water, they breed habitually; but it\nalways ends in the same way. The hand of Fate is against them.\n\nIf a drought comes, they eat off the grass near the water and have to\ntravel far out for a feed. Then they fall away and get weak, and when\nthey come down to drink they get bogged in the muddy waterholes and die\nthere.\n\nOr Providence sends the pleuro, and big strong beasts slink away by\nthemselves, and stand under trees glaring savagely till death comes.\nOr else the tick attacks them, and soon a fine, strong beast becomes\na miserable, shrunken, tottering wreck. Once cattle get really low in\ncondition they are done for. Sheep can be shifted when their pasture\nfails, but you can't shift cattle. They die quicker on the roads than\non the run. The only thing is to watch and pray for rain. It always\ncomes--after the cattle are dead.\n\nAs for describing the animals themselves, it would take volumes. Sheep\nare all alike, but cattle are all different. The drovers on the road\nget to know the habits and tendencies of each particular bullock--the\none-eyed bullock that pokes out to the side of the mob, the inquisitive\nbullock that is always walking over towards the drover as if he were\ngoing to speak to him, the agitator bullock who is always trying to get\nup a stampede and prodding the others with his horns.\n\nIn poor Boake's “Where the Dead Men Lie” he says:\n\n     Only the hand of Night can free them--\n     That's when the dead men fly!\n     Only the frightened cattle see them--\n     See the dead men go by!\n     Cloven hoofs beating out one measure,\n     Bidding the stockman know no leisure--\n     That's when the dead men take their pleasure!\n     That's when the dead men fly!\n\nCattle on a camp see ghosts, sure enough--else, why is it that, when\nhundreds are in camp at night--some standing, some lying asleep, all\nfacing different ways--in an instant, at some invisible cause of alarm,\nthe whole mob are on their feet and all racing _in the same direction_,\naway from some unseen terror?\n\nIt doesn't do to sneak round cattle at night; it is better to whistle\nand sing than to surprise them by a noiseless appearance. Anyone\nsneaking about frightens them, and then they will charge right over\nthe top of somebody on the opposite side, and away into the darkness,\nbecoming more and more frightened as they go, smashing against trees and\nstumps, breaking legs and ribs, and playing the dickens with themselves\ngenerally. Cattle “on the road” are unaccountable animals; one cannot\nsay for certain what they will do. In this respect they differ from\nsheep, whose movements can be predicted with absolute certainty.\n\nAll the cussedness of the bovine race is centred in the cow. In\nAustralia the most opprobious epithet one can apply to a man or other\nobject is “cow”. In the whole range of a bullock-driver's vocabulary\nthere is no word that expresses his blistering scorn so well as “cow”.\nTo an exaggerated feminine perversity the cow adds a fiendish ingenuity\nin making trouble.\n\nA quiet milking-cow will “plant” her calf with such skill that ten\nstockmen cannot find him in a one-mile paddock. While the search goes on\nshe grazes unconcernedly, as if she never had a calf in her life. If\nby chance he be discovered, then one notices a curious thing. The very\nyoungest calf, the merest staggering-Bob two days old, will not move\ntill the old lady gives him orders to do so. One may pull him about\nwithout getting a move out of him. If sufficiently persecuted he will\nat last sing out for help, and then his mother will arrive full-gallop,\ncharge men and horses indiscriminately, and clear out with him to the\nthickest timber in the most rugged part of the creek-bed, defying man to\nget her to the yard.\n\nWhile in his mother's company he seconds her efforts with great\njudgment. But, if he be separated from her, he will follow a horse and\nrider up to the yard thinking he is following his mother, though\nshe bellow instructions to him from the rear. Then the guileless\nagriculturist, having penned him up, sets a dog on him, and his cries\nsoon fetch the old cow full-run to his assistance. Once in the yard\nshe is roped, hauled into the bail, propped up to prevent her throwing\nherself down, and milked by sheer brute-force. After a while she\nsteadies down and will walk into the bail, knowing her turn and behaving\nlike a respectable female.\n\nCows and calves have no idea of sound or distance. If a cow is on the\nopposite side of the fence, and wishes to communicate with her calf, she\nwill put her head through the fence, place her mouth against his ear as\nif she were going to whisper, and then utter a roar that can be heard\ntwo miles off. It would stun a human being; but the calf thinks it over\nfor a moment, and then answers with a prolonged yell in the old cow's\near. So the dialogue goes on for hours without either party dropping\ndead.\n\nThere is an element of danger in dealing with cattle that makes men\nsmart and self-reliant and independent. Men who deal with sheep get\ngloomy and morbid, and are for ever going on strike. Nobody ever heard\nof a stockman's strike. The true stockrider thinks himself just as good\na man as his boss, and inasmuch as “the boss” never makes any money,\nwhile the stockman gets his wages, the stockman may be considered as\nhaving the better position of the two.\n\nSheepmen like to think that they know all about cattle, and could work\nthem if they chose. A Queensland drover once took a big mob from the\nGulf right down through New South Wales, selling various lots as he\nwent. He had to deliver some to a small sheep-man, near Braidwood, who\nwas buying a few hundred cattle as a spec. By the time they arrived, the\ncattle had been on the road eight months, and were quiet as milkers. But\nthe sheep-man and his satellites came out, riding stable-fed horses\nand brandishing twenty-foot whips, all determined to sell their lives\ndearly. They galloped round the astonished cattle and spurred their\nhorses and cracked their whips, till they roused the weary mob. Then\nthey started to cut out the beasts they wanted. The horses rushed and\npulled, and the whips maddened the cattle, and all was turmoil and\nconfusion.\n\nThe Queensland drovers looked on amazed, sitting their patient leg-weary\nhorses they had ridden almost continuously for eight months. At last,\nseeing the hash the sheep-men were making of it, the drovers set to\nwork, and in a little while, without a shout, or crack of a whip, had\ncut out the required number. These the head drover delivered to the\nbuyer, simply remarking, “Many's the time _you_ never cut-out cattle.”\n\nAs I write, there rises a vision of a cattle-camp on an open plain,\nthe blue sky overhead, the long grass rustling below, the great mob of\nparti-coloured cattle eddying restlessly about, thrusting at each other\nwith their horns; and in among the sullen half-savage animals go the\nlight, wiry stock-riders, horse and man working together, watchful,\nquick, and resolute.\n\nA white steer is wanted that is right in the throng. Way!--make way! and\nhorse and rider edge into the restless sea of cattle, the man with his\neye fixed on the selected animal, the horse, glancing eagerly about him,\ntrying to discover which is the wanted one. The press divides and the\nwhite steer scuttles along the edge of the mob trying to force his way\nin again. Suddenly he and two or three others are momentarily eddied out\nto the outskirts of the mob, and in that second the stockman dashes his\nhorse between them and the main body. The lumbering beasts rush hither\nand thither in a vain attempt to return to their comrades. Those not\nwanted are allowed to return, but the white steer finds, to his\ndismay, that wherever he turns that horse and man and dreaded whip are\nconfronting him. He doubles and dodges and makes feints to charge,\nbut the horse anticipates every movement and wheels quicker than the\nbullock. At last the white steer sees the outlying mob he is required to\njoin, and trots off to them quite happy, while horse and rider return to\ncut out another.\n\nIt is a pretty exhibition of skill and intelligence, doubly pleasant to\nwatch because of the undoubted interest that the horses take in it. Big,\nstupid creatures that they are, cursed with highly-strung nerves, and\nblessed with little sense, they are pathetically anxious to do such\nwork as they can understand. So they go into the cutting-out camp with a\nzest, and toil all day edging lumbering bullocks out of the mob, but as\nsoon as a bad rider gets on them and begins to haul their mouths about,\ntheir nerves overcome them, and they get awkward and frightened. A horse\nthat is a crack camp-horse in one man's hands may be a hopeless brute in\nthe hands of another.\n\n\n\n\nWHITE-WHEN-HE'S-WANTED\n\n\nBuckalong was a big freehold of some 80,000 acres, belonging to an\nabsentee syndicate, and therefore run in most niggardly style. There was\na manager on 200 pounds a year, Sandy M'Gregor to wit--a hard-headed old\nScotchman known as “four-eyed M'Gregor”, because he wore spectacles.\nFor assistants, he had half-a-dozen of us--jackaroos and\ncolonial-experiencers--who got nothing a year, and earned it.\n\nWe had, in most instances, paid premiums to learn the noble art of\nsquatting--which now appears to me hardly worth studying, for so much\ndepends on luck that a man with a head as long as a horse's has little\nbetter chance than the fool just imported. Besides the manager and the\njackaroos, there were a few boundary riders to prowl round the fences of\nthe vast paddocks. This constituted the whole station staff.\n\nBuckalong was on one of the main routes by which stock were taken to\nmarket, or from the plains to the tablelands, and vice versa. Great mobs\nof travelling sheep constantly passed through the run, eating up the\ngrass and vexing the soul of the manager. By law, sheep must travel six\nmiles per day, and they must be kept to within half-a-mile of the road.\nOf course we kept all the grass near the road eaten bare, to discourage\ntravellers from coming that way.\n\nSuch hapless wretches as did venture through Buckalong used to try hard\nto stray from the road and pick up a feed, but old Sandy was always\nready for them, and would have them dogged right through the run. This\nbred feuds, and bad language, and personal combats between us and the\ndrovers, whom we looked upon as natural enemies.\n\nThe men who came through with mobs of cattle used to pull down the\npaddock fences at night, and slip the cattle in for refreshments, but\nold Sandy often turned out at 2 or 3 a.m. to catch a mob of bullocks\nin the horse-paddock, and then off they went to Buckalong pound. The\ndrovers, as in duty bound, attributed the trespass to accident--broken\nrails, and so on--and sometimes they tried to rescue the cattle, which\nagain bred strife and police-court summonses.\n\nBesides having a particular aversion to drovers, old M'Gregor had\na general “down” on the young Australians whom he comprehensively\ndescribed as a “feckless, horrse-dealin', horrse-stealin', crawlin' lot\no' wretches.” According to him, a native-born would sooner work a horse\nto death than work for a living any day. He hated any man who wanted to\nsell him a horse.\n\n“As aw walk the street,” he used to say, “the fouk disna stawp me to buy\nclaes nor shoon, an' wheerfore should they stawp me to buy horrses? It's\n'Mister M'Gregor, will ye purrchase a horrse?' Let them wait till I ask\nthem to come wi' their horrses.”\n\nSuch being his views on horseflesh and drovers, we felt no little\nexcitement when one Sunday, at dinner, the cook came in to say there\nwas “a drover-chap outside wanted the boss to come and have a look at\na horse.” M'Gregor simmered a while, and muttered something about the\n“Sawbath day”; but at last he went out, and we filed after him to see\nthe fun.\n\nThe drover stood by the side of his horse, beneath the acacia trees\nin the yard. He had a big scar on his face, apparently the result\nof collision with a fence; he looked thin and sickly and seemed\npoverty-stricken enough to disarm hostility. Obviously, he was down on\nhis luck. Had it not been for that indefinable self-reliant look which\ndrovers--the Ishmaels of the bush--always acquire, one might have taken\nhim for a swagman. His horse was in much the same plight. It was a\nragged, unkempt pony, pitifully poor and very footsore, at first sight,\nan absolute “moke”; but a second glance showed colossal round ribs,\nsquare hips, and a great length of rein, the rest hidden beneath a\nwealth of loose hair. He looked like “a good journey horse”, possibly\nsomething better.\n\nWe gathered round while M'Gregor questioned the drover. The man was\nmonosyllabic to a degree, as the real bushmen generally are. It is only\nthe rowdy and the town-bushy that are fluent of speech.\n\n“Guid mornin',” said M'Gregor.\n\n“Mornin', boss,” said the drover, shortly.\n\n“Is this the horrse ye hae for sale?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Ay,” and M'Gregor looked at the pony with a businesslike\ndon't-think-much-of-him air, ran his hand lightly over the hard legs,\nand opened the passive creature's mouth. “H'm,” he said. Then he turned\nto the drover. “Ye seem a bit oot o' luck. Ye're thin like. What's been\nthe matter?”\n\n“Been sick with fever--Queensland fever. Just come through from the\nNorth. Been out on the Diamantina last.”\n\n“Ay. I was there mysel',” said M'Gregor. “Hae ye the fever on ye still?”\n\n“Yes--goin' home to get rid of it.”\n\nA man can only get Queensland fever in a malarial district, but he\ncan carry it with him wherever he goes. If he stays, it will sap his\nstrength and pull him to pieces; if he moves to a better climate,\nthe malady moves with him, leaving him by degrees, and coming back at\nregular intervals to rack, shake, burn, and sweat its victim. Gradually\nit wears itself out, often wearing its patient out at the same time.\nM'Gregor had been through the experience, and there was a slight change\nin his voice as he went on with his palaver.\n\n“Whaur are ye makin' for the noo?”\n\n“Monaro--my people live in Monaro.”\n\n“Hoo will ye get to Monaro gin ye sell the horrse?”\n\n“Coach and rail. Too sick to care about ridin',” said the drover, while\na wan smile flitted over his yellow-grey features. “I've rode him far\nenough. I've rode that horse a thousand miles. I wouldn't sell him, only\nI'm a bit hard up. Sellin' him now to get the money to go home.”\n\n“Hoo auld is he?”\n\n“Seven.”\n\n“Is he a guid horrse on a camp?” asked M'Gregor.\n\n“No better camp-horse in Queensland,” said the drover. “You can chuck\nthe reins on his neck, an' he'll cut out a beast by himself.”\n\nM'Gregor's action in this matter puzzled us. We spent our time crawling\nafter sheep, and a camp-horse would be about as much use to us as\nside-pockets to a pig. We had expected Sandy to rush the fellow off the\nplace at once, and we couldn't understand how it was that he took\nso much interest in him. Perhaps the fever-racked drover and the old\ncamp-horse appealed to him in a way incomprehensible to us. We had never\nbeen on the Queensland cattle-camps, nor shaken and shivered with the\nfever, nor lived the roving life of the overlanders. M'Gregor had done\nall this, and his heart (I can see it all now) went out to the man who\nbrought the old days back to him.\n\n“Ah, weel,” he said, “we hae'na muckle use for a camp-horrse here, ye\nken; wi'oot some of these lads wad like to try theer han' cuttin'\noot the milkers' cawves frae their mithers.” And the old man laughed\ncontemptuously, while we felt humbled in the sight of the man from far\nback. “An' what'll ye be wantin' for him?” asked M'Gregor.\n\n“Reckon he's worth fifteen notes,” said the drover.\n\nThis fairly staggered us. Our estimates had varied between thirty\nshillings and a fiver. We thought the negotiations would close abruptly;\nbut M'Gregor, after a little more examination, agreed to give the price,\nprovided the saddle and bridle, both grand specimens of ancient art,\nwere given in. This was agreed to, and the drover was sent off to get\nhis meals in the hut before leaving by the coach.\n\n“The mon is verra harrd up, an' it's a sair thing that Queensland\nfever,” was the only remark M'Gregor made. But we knew now that there\nwas a soft spot in his heart somewhere.\n\nNext morning the drover got a crisp-looking cheque. He said no word\nwhile the cheque was being written, but, as he was going away, the horse\nhappened to be in the yard, and he went over to the old comrade that had\ncarried him so many miles, and laid a hand on his neck.\n\n“He ain't much to look at,” said the drover, speaking slowly and\nawkwardly, “but he's white when he's wanted.” And just before the coach\nrattled off, the man of few words leant down from the box and nodded\nimpressively, and repeated, “Yes, he's white when he's wanted.”\n\nWe didn't trouble to give the new horse a name. Station horses are\ngenerally called after the man from whom they are bought. “Tom Devine”,\n“The Regan mare”, “Black M'Carthy” and “Bay M'Carthy” were among the\nappellations of our horses at that time. As we didn't know the drover's\nname, we simply called the animal “The new horse” until a still newer\nhorse was one day acquired. Then, one of the hands being told to take\nthe new horse, said, “D'yer mean the _new_ new horse or the _old_ new\nhorse?”\n\n“Naw,” said the boss, “not the new horrse--that bay horrse we bought\nfrae the drover. The ane he said was white when he's wanted.”\n\nAnd so, by degrees, the animal came to be referred to as the horse\nthat's white when he's wanted, and at last settled down to the definite\nname of “White-when-he's-wanted”.\n\nWhite-when-he's-wanted didn't seem much of an acquisition. He was sent\nout to do slavery for Greenhide Billy, a boundary-rider who plumed\nhimself on having once been a cattle-man. After a week's experience of\n“White”, Billy came in to the homestead disgusted. The pony was so lazy\nthat he had to build a fire under him to get him to move, and so rough\nthat it made a man's nose bleed to ride him more than a mile. “The boss\nmust have been off his head to give fifteen notes for such a cow.”\n\nM'Gregor heard this complaint. “Verra weel, Mr. Billy,” said he, hotly,\n“ye can juist tak' ane of the young horrses in yon paddock, an' if he\nbucks wi' ye an' kills ye, it's yer ain fault. Ye're a cattleman--so ye\nsay--dommed if ah believe it. Ah believe ye're a dairy-farmin' body frae\nIllawarra. Ye ken neither horrse nor cattle. Mony's the time ye never\nrode buckjumpers, Mr. Billy”--and with this parting-shot the old man\nturned into the house, and White-when-he's-wanted came back to the head\nstation.\n\nFor a while he was a sort of pariah. He used to yard the horses, fetch\nup the cows, and hunt travelling sheep through the run. He really was\nlazy and rough, and we all decided that Billy's opinion of him was\ncorrect, until the day came to make one of our periodical raids on the\nwild horses in the hills at the back of the run.\n\nEvery now and again we formed parties to run in some of these animals,\nand, after nearly galloping to death half-a-dozen good horses, we\nwould capture three or four brumbies, and bring them in triumph to the\nhomestead to be broken in. By the time they had thrown half the crack\nriders on the station, broken all the bridles, rolled on all the\nsaddles, and kicked all the dogs, they would be marketable (and no great\nbargains) at about thirty shillings a head.\n\nYet there is no sport in the world to be mentioned in the same volume as\n“running horses”, and we were very keen on it. All the crack nags were\ngot as fit as possible, and fed up beforehand; and on this particular\noccasion White-when-he's-wanted, being in good trim, was given a week's\nhard feed and lent to a harum-scarum fellow from the Upper Murray, who\nhappened to be working in a survey camp on the run. How he did open our\neyes!\n\nHe ran the mob from hill to hill, from range to range, across open\ncountry and back again to the hills, over flats and gullies,\nthrough hop-scrub and stringybark ridges; and all the time\nWhite-when-he's-wanted was on the wing of the mob, pulling double. The\nmares and foals dropped out, the colts and young stock pulled up dead\nbeat, and only the seasoned veterans were left. Most of our horses caved\nin altogether; one or two were kept in the hunt by judicious nursing and\nshirking the work; but White-when-he's-wanted was with the quarry from\nend to end of the run, doing double his share; and at the finish, when a\nchance offered to wheel them into the trapyard, he simply smothered them\nfor pace, and slewed them into the wings before they knew where they\nwere. Such a capture had not fallen to our lot for many a day, and the\nfame of White-when-he's-wanted was speedily noised abroad.\n\nHe was always fit for work, always hungry, always ready to lie down and\nroll, and always lazy. But when he heard the rush of the brumbies' feet\nin the scrub he became frantic with excitement. He could race over the\nroughest ground without misplacing a hoof or altering his stride, and he\ncould sail over fallen timber and across gullies like a kangaroo. Nearly\nevery Sunday we were after the brumbies, until they got as lean as\ngreyhounds and as cunning as policemen. We were always ready to back\nWhite-when-he's-wanted to run-down, single-handed, any animal in\nthe bush that we liked to put him after--wild horses, wild cattle,\nkangaroos, emus, dingoes, kangaroo-rats--we barred nothing, for, if he\ncouldn't beat them for pace, he would outlast them.\n\nAnd then one day he disappeared from the paddock, and we never saw him\nagain. We knew there were plenty of men in the district who would steal\nhim; but, as we knew also of many more who would “inform” for a pound\nor two, we were sure that it could not have been local “talent” that\nhad taken him. We offered good rewards and set some of the right sort to\nwork, but heard nothing of him for about a year.\n\nThen the surveyor's assistant turned up again, after a trip to the\ninterior. He told us the usual string of back-block lies, and wound up\nby saying that out on the very fringe of settlement he had met an old\nacquaintance.\n\n“Who was that?”\n\n“Why, that little bay horse that I rode after the brumbies that time.\nThe one you called White-when-he's-wanted.”\n\n“The deuce you did! Are you sure? Who had him?”\n\n“Sure! I'd swear to him anywhere. A little drover fellow had him. A\nlittle fellow, with a big scar across his forehead. Came from Monaro way\nsomewhere. He said he bought the horse from you for fifteen notes.”\n\nThe King's warrant doesn't run much out west of Boulia, and it is not\nlikely that any of us will ever see the drover again, or will ever again\ncross the back of “White-when-he's-wanted”.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DOWNFALL OF MULLIGAN'S\n\n\nThe sporting men of Mulligan's were an exceedingly knowing lot; in fact,\nthey had obtained the name amongst their neighbours of being a little\nbit too knowing. They had “taken down” the adjoining town in a variety\nof ways. They were always winning maiden plates with horses which were\nshrewdly suspected to be old and well-tried performers in disguise.\n\nWhen the sports of Paddy's Flat unearthed a phenomenal runner in the\nshape of a blackfellow called Frying-pan Joe, the Mulligan contingent\nimmediately took the trouble to discover a blackfellow of their own,\nand they made a match and won all the Paddy's Flat money with ridiculous\nease; then their blackfellow turned out to be a well-known Sydney\nperformer. They had a man who could fight, a man who could be backed to\njump five-feet-ten, a man who could kill eight pigeons out of nine at\nthirty yards, a man who could make a break of fifty or so at billiards\nif he tried; they could all drink, and they all had that indefinite look\nof infinite wisdom and conscious superiority which belongs only to those\nwho know something about horseflesh.\n\nThey knew a great many things never learnt at Sunday-school. They were\nexperts at cards and dice. They would go to immense trouble to work off\nany small swindle in the sporting line. In short the general consensus\nof opinion was that they were a very “fly” crowd at Mulligan's, and if\nyou went there you wanted to “keep your eyes skinned” or they'd “have”\n you over a threepenny-bit.\n\nThere were races at Sydney one Christmas, and a select band of the\nMulligan sportsmen were going down to them. They were in high\nfeather, having just won a lot of money from a young Englishman at\npigeon-shooting, by the simple method of slipping blank cartridges into\nhis gun when he wasn't looking, and then backing the bird.\n\nThey intended to make a fortune out of the Sydney people, and admirers\nwho came to see them off only asked them as a favour to leave money\nenough in Sydney to make it worth while for another detachment to go\ndown later on. Just as the train was departing a priest came running on\nto the platform, and was bundled into the carriage where our Mulligan\nfriends were; the door was slammed to, and away they went. His Reverence\nwas hot and perspiring, and for a few minutes mopped himself with a\nhandkerchief, while the silence was unbroken except by the rattle of the\ntrain.\n\nAfter a while one of the Mulligan fraternity got out a pack of cards and\nproposed a game to while away the time. There was a young squatter in\nthe carriage who looked as if he might be induced to lose a few pounds,\nand the sportsmen thought they would be neglecting their opportunities\nif they did not try to “get a bit to go on with” from him. He agreed to\nplay, and, just as a matter of courtesy, they asked the priest whether\nhe would take a hand.\n\n“What game d'ye play?” he asked, in a melodious brogue.\n\nThey explained that any game was equally acceptable to them, but they\nthought it right to add that they generally played for money.\n\n“Sure an' it don't matter for wanst in a way,” said he--“Oi'll take\na hand bedad--Oi'm only going about fifty miles, so Oi can't lose a\nfortune.”\n\nThey lifted a light portmanteau on to their knees to make a table, and\nfive of them--three of the Mulligan crowd and the two strangers--started\nto have a little game of poker. Things looked rosy for the Mulligan\nboys, who chuckled as they thought how soon they were making a\nbeginning, and what a magnificent yarn they would have to tell about how\nthey rooked a priest on the way down.\n\nNothing sensational resulted from the first few deals, and the priest\nbegan to ask questions.\n\n“Be ye going to the races?”\n\nThey said they were.\n\n“Ah! and Oi suppose ye'll be betting wid thim bookmakers--betting on the\nhorses, will yez? They do be terrible knowing men, thim bookmakers, they\ntell me. I wouldn't bet much if Oi was ye,” he said, with an affable\nsmile. “If ye go bettin' ye will be took in wid thim bookmakers.”\n\nThe boys listened with a bored air and reckoned that by the time they\nparted the priest would have learnt that they were well able to look\nafter themselves. They went steadily on with the game, and the priest\nand the young squatter won slightly; this was part of the plan to lead\nthem on to plunge. They neared the station where the priest was to get\nout. He had won rather more than they liked, so the signal was passed\nround to “put the cross on”. Poker is a game at which a man need not\nrisk much unless he feels inclined, and on this deal the priest stood\nout. Consequently, when they drew up at his station he was still a few\npounds in.\n\n“Bedad,” he said, “Oi don't loike goin' away wid yer money. Oi'll go on\nto the next station so as ye can have revinge.” Then he sat down again,\nand play went on in earnest.\n\nThe man of religion seemed to have the Devil's own luck. When he was\ndealt a good hand he invariably backed it well, and if he had a bad one\nhe would not risk anything. The sports grew painfully anxious as they\nsaw him getting further and further ahead of them, prattling away all\nthe time like a big schoolboy. The squatter was the biggest loser so\nfar, but the priest was the only winner. All the others were out of\npocket. His reverence played with great dash, and seemed to know a lot\nabout the game, so that on arrival at the second station he was a good\nround sum in pocket.\n\nHe rose to leave them with many expressions of regret, and laughingly\npromised full revenge next time. Just as he was opening the carriage\ndoor, one of the Mulligan fraternity said in a stage-whisper: “He's a\nblanky sink-pocket. If he can come this far, let him come on to Sydney\nand play for double the stakes.” Like a shot the priest turned on him.\n\n“Bedad, an' if _that's_ yer talk, Oi'll play ye fer double stakes from\nhere to the other side of glory. Do yez think men are mice because they\neat cheese? It isn't one of the Ryans would be fearing to give any man\nhis revinge!”\n\nHe snorted defiance at them, grabbed his cards and waded in. The others\nfelt that a crisis was at hand and settled down to play in a dead\nsilence. But the priest kept on winning steadily, and the “old man” of\nthe Mulligan push saw that something decisive must be done, and decided\non a big plunge to get all the money back on one hand. By a dexterous\nmanipulation of the cards he dealt himself four kings, almost the best\nhand at poker. Then he began with assumed hesitation to bet on his hand,\nraising the stake little by little.\n\n“Sure ye're trying to bluff, so ye are!” said the priest, and\nimmediately raised it.\n\nThe others had dropped out of the game and watched with painful interest\nthe stake grow and grow. The Mulligan fraternity felt a cheerful\ncertainty that the “old man” had made things safe, and regarded\nthemselves as mercifully delivered from an unpleasant situation.\nThe priest went on doggedly raising the stake in response to his\nantagonist's challenges until it had attained huge dimensions.\n\n“Sure that's high enough,” said he, putting into the pool sufficient to\nentitle him to see his opponent's hand.\n\nThe “old man” with great gravity laid down his four kings, whereat the\nMulligan boys let a big sigh of relief escape them.\n\nThen the priest laid down four aces and scooped the pool.\n\nThe sportsmen of Mulligan's never quite knew how they got out to\nRandwick. They borrowed a bit of money in Sydney, and found themselves\nin the saddling-paddock in a half-dazed condition, trying to realize\nwhat had happened to them. During the afternoon they were up at the end\nof the lawn near the Leger stand and could hear the babel of tongues,\nsmall bookmakers, thimble riggers, confidence men, and so on, plying\ntheir trades outside. In the tumult of voices they heard one that\nsounded familiar. Soon suspicion grew into certainty, and they knew that\nit was the voice of “Father” Ryan. They walked to the fence and looked\nover. This is what he was saying:--\n\n“Pop it down, gents! Pop it down! If you don't put down a brick you\ncan't pick up a castle! I'll bet no one here can pick the knave of\nhearts out of these three cards. I'll bet half-a-sovereign no one here\ncan find the knave!”\n\nThen the crowd parted a little, and through the opening they could see\nhim distinctly, doing a great business and showing wonderful dexterity\nwith the pasteboard.\n\nThere is still enough money in Sydney to make it worth while for another\ndetachment to come down from Mulligan's; but the next lot will hesitate\nabout playing poker with priests in the train.\n\n\n\n\nTHE AMATEUR GARDENER\n\n\nThe first step in amateur gardening is to sit down and consider what\ngood you are going to get by it. If you are only a tenant by the month,\nas most people are, it is obviously not of much use for you to plant a\nfruit orchard or an avenue of oak trees. What you want is something that\nwill grow quickly, and will stand transplanting, for when you move it\nwould be a sin to leave behind you the plants on which you have spent so\nmuch labour and so much patent manure.\n\nWe knew a man once who was a bookmaker by trade--and a Leger bookmaker\nat that--but had a passion for horses and flowers. When he “had a big\nwin”, as he occasionally did, it was his custom to have movable wooden\nstables, built on skids, put up in the yard, and to have tons of the\nbest soil that money could buy carted into the garden of the premises\nwhich he was occupying.\n\nThen he would keep splendid horses, and grow rare roses and show-bench\nchrysanthemums. His landlord passing by would see the garden in a\nblaze of colour, and promise himself to raise the bookmaker's rent next\nquarter day.\n\nHowever, when the bookmaker “took the knock”, as he invariably did at\nleast twice a year, it was his pleasing custom to move without giving\nnotice. He would hitch two cart-horses to the stables, and haul them\nright away at night. He would not only dig up the roses, trees, and\nchrysanthemums he had planted, but would also cart away the soil he\nhad brought in; in fact, he used to shift the garden bodily. He had one\ngarden that he shifted to nearly every suburb in Sydney; and he always\nargued that the change of air was invaluable for chrysanthemums.\n\nBeing determined, then, to go in for gardening on common-sense\nprinciples, and having decided on the shrubs you mean to grow, the next\nconsideration is your chance of growing them.\n\nIf your neighbour keeps game fowls, it may be taken for granted that\nbefore long they will pay you a visit, and you will see the rooster\nscratching your pot plants out by the roots as if they were so much\nstraw, just to make a nice place to lie down and fluff the dust over\nhimself. Goats will also stray in from the street, and bite the young\nshoots off, selecting the most valuable plants with a discrimination\nthat would do credit to a professional gardener.\n\nIt is therefore useless to think of growing delicate or squeamish\nplants. Most amateur gardeners maintain a lifelong struggle against the\ndevices of Nature; but when the forces of man and the forces of Nature\ncome into conflict Nature wins every time. Nature has decreed that\ncertain plants shall be hardy, and therefore suitable to suburban\namateur gardeners; the suburban amateur gardener persists in trying to\ngrow quite other plants, and in despising those marked out by Nature for\nhis use. It is to correct this tendency that this article is written.\n\nThe greatest standby to the amateur gardener should undoubtedly be the\nblue-flowered shrub known as “plumbago”. This homely but hardy plant\nwill grow anywhere. It naturally prefers a good soil, and a sufficient\nrainfall, but if need be it will worry along without either. Fowls\ncannot scratch it up, and even the goat turns away dismayed from its\nhard-featured branches. The flower is not strikingly beautiful nor\nravishingly scented, but it flowers nine months out of the year;\nsmothered with street dust and scorched by the summer sun, you will find\nthat faithful old plumbago plugging along undismayed. A plant like\nthis should be encouraged--but the misguided amateur gardener as a rule\ndespises it.\n\nThe plant known as the churchyard geranium is also one marked out by\nProvidence for the amateur; so is Cosmea, which comes up year after year\nwhere once planted. In creepers, bignonia and lantana will hold their\nown under difficulties perhaps as well as any that can be found. In\ntrees the Port Jackson fig is a patriotic one to grow. It is a fine\nplant to provide exercise, as it sheds its leaves unsparingly, and\nrequires the whole garden to be swept up every day.\n\nYour aim as a student of Nature should be to encourage the survival\nof the fittest. There is a grass called nut grass, and another called\nParramatta grass, either of which holds its own against anything living\nor dead. The average gardening manual gives you recipes for destroying\nthese. Why should you destroy them in favour of a sickly plant that\nneeds constant attention? No. The Parramatta grass is the selected of\nNature, and who are you to interfere with Nature?\n\nHaving decided to go in for strong, simple plants that will hold their\nown, and a bit over, you must get your implements of husbandry.\n\nThe spade is the first thing, but the average ironmonger will show you\nan unwieldy weapon only meant to be used by navvies. Don't buy it. Get a\nsmall spade, about half-size--it is nice and light and doesn't tire the\nwrist, and with it you can make a good display of enthusiasm, and earn\nthe hypocritical admiration of your wife. After digging for half-an-hour\nor so, get her to rub your back with any of the backache cures. From\nthat moment you will have no further need for the spade.\n\nA barrow is about the only other thing needed; anyhow, it is almost a\nnecessity for wheeling cases of whisky up to the house. A rake is useful\nwhen your terrier dog has bailed up a cat, and will not attack it until\nthe cat is made to run.\n\nTalking of terrier dogs, an acquaintance of ours has a dog that does all\nhis gardening. The dog is a small elderly terrier with a failing memory.\nAs soon as the terrier has planted a bone in the garden the owner slips\nover, digs it up and takes it away. When that terrier goes back and\nfinds the bone gone, he distrusts his memory, and begins to think that\nperhaps he has made a mistake, and has dug in the wrong place; so he\nsets to work, and digs patiently all over the garden, turning over acres\nof soil in the course of his search. This saves his master a lot of\nbackache.\n\nThe sensible amateur gardener, then, will not attempt to fight with\nNature but will fall in with her views. What more pleasant than to get\nout of bed at 11.30 on a Sunday morning; to look out of your window at\na lawn waving with the feathery plumes of Parramatta grass, and to see\nbeyond it the churchyard geranium flourishing side by side with the\nplumbago and the Port Jackson fig?\n\nThe garden gate blows open, and the local commando of goats, headed by\nan aged and fragrant patriarch, locally known as De Wet, rushes in; but\ntheir teeth will barely bite through the wiry stalks of the Parramatta\ngrass, and the plumbago and the figtree fail to attract them, and\nbefore long they stand on one another's shoulders, scale the fence, and\ndisappear into the next-door garden, where a fanatic is trying to grow\nshow roses.\n\nAfter the last goat has scaled your neighbour's fence, and only De Wet\nis left, your little dog discovers him. De Wet beats a hurried retreat,\napparently at full speed, with the dog exactly one foot behind him in\nfrantic pursuit. We say apparently at full speed, because experience has\ntaught that De Wet can run as fast as a greyhound when he likes; but\nhe never exerts himself to go faster than is necessary to keep just in\nfront of whatever dog is after him.\n\nHearing the scrimmage, your neighbour comes on to his verandah, and sees\nthe chase going down the street.\n\n“Ha! that wretched old De Wet again!” he says. “Small hope your dog has\nof catching him! Why don't you get a garden gate like mine, so that he\nwon't get in?”\n\n“No; he can't get in at your gate,” is the reply; “but I think his\ncommando are in your back garden now.”\n\nThen follows a frantic rush. Your neighbour falls downstairs in his\nhaste, and the commando, after stopping to bite some priceless pot\nplants of your neighbour's as they come out, skips easily back over the\nfence and through your gate into the street again.\n\nIf a horse gets in his hoofs make no impression on the firm turf of the\nParramatta grass, and you get quite a hearty laugh by dropping a chair\non him from the first-floor window.\n\nThe game fowls of your other neighbour come fluttering into your garden,\nand scratch and chuckle and fluff themselves under your plumbago bush;\nbut you don't worry. Why should you? They can't hurt it; and, besides,\nyou know that the small black hen and the big yellow one, who have\ndisappeared from the throng, are even now laying their daily egg for you\nbehind the thickest bush.\n\nYour little dog rushes frantically up and down the front bed of your\ngarden, barking and racing, and tearing up the ground, because his rival\nlittle dog, who lives down the street, is going past with his master,\nand each pretends that he wants to be at the other--as they have\npretended every day for the past three years. The performance he is\ngoing through doesn't disturb you. Why should it? By following the\ndirections in this article you have selected plants he cannot hurt.\n\nAfter breakfasting at noon, you stroll out, and, perhaps, smooth with\nyour foot, or with your spade, the inequalities made by the hens; you\ngather up casually the eggs they have laid; you whistle to your little\ndog, and go out for a stroll with a light heart.\n\n\n\n\nTHIRSTY ISLAND\n\n\nTravellers approaching a bush township are sure to find some distance\nfrom the town a lonely public-house waiting by the roadside to give\nthem welcome. Thirsty (miscalled Thursday) Island is the outlying pub of\nAustralia.\n\nWhen the China and British-India steamers arrive from the North the\nfirst place they come to is Thirsty Island, the sentinel at the gate of\nTorres Straits. New chums on the steamers see a fleet of white-sailed\npearling luggers, a long pier clustered with a hybrid crowd of every\ncolour, caste and creed under Heaven, and at the back of it all a little\ngalvanized-iron town shining in the sun.\n\nFor nine months of the year a crisp, cool south-east wind blows, the\nsnow-white beach is splashed with spray and dotted with the picturesque\nfigures of Japanese divers and South Sea Island boatmen. Coco-nut palms\nline the roads by the beach, and back of the town are the barracks and a\nfort nestling among the trees on the hillside. Thirsty Island is a nice\nplace--to look at.\n\nWhen a vessel makes fast the Thirsty Islanders come down to greet\nthe new-comers and give them welcome to Australia. The new-chums are\ninclined to patronise these simple, outlying people. Fresh from the\niniquities of the China-coast cocktail and the unhallowed orgies of the\nSourabaya Club, new-chums think they have little to learn in the way of\ndrink; at any rate, they haven't come all the way to Thursday Island\nto be taught anything. Poor new-chums! Little do they know the kind of\npeople they are up against.\n\nThe following description of a night at Thursday Island is taken from a\nnew-chum's note book:\n\n“Passed Proudfoot shoal and arrived at Thursday Island. First sight\nof Australia. Lot of men came aboard, all called Captain. They are all\npearl-fishers or pilots, not a bit like the bushmen I expected. When\nthey came aboard they divided into parties. Some invaded the Captain's\ncabin; others sat in the smoking room; the rest crowded into the saloon.\nThey talked to the passengers about the Boer War, and told us about\npearls worth 1000 pounds that had been found lately.\n\n“One captain pulled a handful of loose pearls out of a jar and handed\nthem round in a casual way for us to look at. The stewards opened\nbottles and we all sat down for a drink and a smoke. I spoke to one\ncaptain--an oldish man--and he grinned amiably, but did not answer.\nAnother captain leaned over to me and said, 'Don't take any notice of\nhim, he's boozed all this week.'\n\n“Conversation and drink became general. The night was very hot and\nclose, and some of the passengers seemed to be taking more than was good\nfor them. A contagious thirst spread round the ship, and before long the\nstewards and firemen were at it. The saloon became an inferno of drink\nand sweat and tobacco smoke. Perfect strangers were talking to each\nother at the top of their voices.\n\n“Young MacTavish, who is in a crack English regiment, asked the captain\nof a pearling lugger whether he didn't know Talbot de Cholmondeley in\nthe Blues.\n\n“The pearler said very likely he had met 'em, and no doubt he'd remember\ntheir faces if he saw them, but he never could remember names.\n\n“Another passenger--a Jew--was trying to buy some pearls cheap from the\ncaptains, but the more the captains drank the less anxious they became\nto talk about pearls.\n\n“The night wore on, and still the drinks circulated. Young MacTavish\nslept profoundly.\n\n“One passenger gave his steward a sovereign as he was leaving the\nship, and in half an hour the steward was carried to his berth in\na fit--alcoholic in its origin. Another steward was observed openly\ndrinking the passengers' whisky. When accused, he didn't even attempt\nto defend himself; the great Thursday Island thirst seemed to have\ncommunicated itself to everyone on board, and he simply _had_ to drink.\n\n“About three in the morning a tour of the ship disclosed the following\nstate of affairs: Captain's room full of captains solemnly tight;\nsmoking-room empty, except for the inanimate form of the captain who had\nbeen boozed all the week, and was now sleeping peacefully with his feet\non the sofa and his head on the floor. The saloon was full of captains\nand passengers--the latter mostly in a state of collapse or laughing and\nsinging deliriously; the rails lined with firemen who had business over\nthe side; stewards ditto.\n\n“At last the Thursday Islanders departed, unsteadily, but still on their\nfeet, leaving a demoralized ship behind them. And young MacTavish,\nwho has seen a thing or two in his brief span, staggered to his berth,\nsaying, 'My God! Is _all_ Australia like this place?'”\n\n   *  *  *  *  *\n\nWhen no ships arrive, the Islanders just drop into the pubs, as a\nmatter of routine, for their usual evening soak. They drink weird\ncompounds--horehound beer, known as “lady dog”, and things like that.\nAbout two in the morning they go home speechless, but still able to\ntravel. It is very rarely that an Islander gets helplessly drunk, but\nstrangers generally have to be put to bed.\n\nThe Japanese on the island are a strong faction. They have a club of\ntheir own, and once gave a dinner to mark the death of one of their\nmembers. He was shrewdly suspected of having tried to drown another\nmember by cutting his airpipe, so, when he died, the club celebrated\nthe event. The Japanese are not looked upon with favor by the white\nislanders. They send their money to Japan--thousands of pounds a year go\nthrough the little office in money-orders--and so they are not “good for\ntrade”.\n\nThe Manilamen and Kanakas and Torres Strait islanders, on the other\nhand, bring all the money they do not spend on the pearling schooner to\nthe island, and “blow it in”, like men. They knife each other sometimes,\nand now and again have to be run in wholesale, but they are “good for\ntrade”. The local lock-up has a record of eighteen drunks run in in\nseven minutes. They weren't taken along in carriages-and-four, either;\nthey were mostly dragged along by the scruff of the neck.\n\nBilly Malkeela, the South Sea diver, summed up the Japanese\nquestion--“Seems to me dis Islan' soon b'long Japanee altogedder. One\ntime pa-lenty rickatta (plenty regatta), all same Isle of Wight. Now no\nmore rickatta. All money go Japan!”\n\nAn English new-chum made his appearance there lately--a most undefeated\nsportsman. He was put down in a diving dress in about eight feet of\nwater, where he bubbled and struggled about in great style. Suddenly he\nturned, rushed for the beach, and made for the foot of a tree, which he\ntried to climb under the impression that he was still at the bottom of\nthe ocean. Then he was hauled in by the life-line.\n\nThe pearlers thought to get some fun out of him by giving him an oyster\nto open in which they had previously planted a pearl; he never saw the\npearl and threw the oyster into the scuppers with the rest, and the\npearlers had to go down on all fours and grope for that pearl among the\nstinking oysters. It was funny--but not in the way they had intended.\n\nThe pearlers go out in schooners called floating stations (their enemies\ncall them floating public-houses) and no man knows what hospitality\nis till he has been a guest on a pearling schooner. They carry it to\nextremes sometimes. Some pearlers were out in a lugger, and were passing\nby one of these schooners. They determined not to go on board, as it was\nlate, and they were in a hurry. The captain of the schooner went below,\ngot his rifle and put two bullets through their foresail. Then they put\nthe helm down and went aboard; it was an invitation almost equivalent to\na royal command. They felt heartily ashamed of themselves as they slunk\nup on deck, and the captain of the schooner eyed them reproachfully.\n\n“I couldn't let you disgrace yourselves by passing my schooner,” he\nsaid; “but if it ever happens again I'll fire at the deck. A man that\nwould pass a schooner in broad daylight is better dead.”\n\nThere is a fort and garrison at Thirsty Island, but they are not needed.\nIf an invading fleet comes this way it should be encouraged by every\npossible means to land at the island; the heat, the thirst, the\nhorehound beer, and the Islanders may be trusted to do the rest.\n\n\n\n\nDAN FITZGERALD EXPLAINS\n\n\nThe circus was having its afternoon siesta. Overhead the towering canvas\ntent spread like a giant mushroom on a network of stalks--slanting\nbeams, interlaced with guys and wire ropes.\n\nThe ring looked small and lonely; its circle of empty benches seemed\nto stare intently at it, as though some sort of unseen performance were\ngoing on for the benefit of a ghostly audience. Now and again a guy rope\ncreaked, or a loose end of canvas flapped like faint, unreal applause,\nas the silence shut down again, it did not need much imagination to\npeople the ring with dead and gone circus riders performing for the\nbenefit of shadowy spectators packed on those benches.\n\nIn the menagerie portion matters were different; here there was a free\nand easy air, the animals realising that for the present the eyes of the\npublic were off them, and they could put in the afternoon as they chose.\n\nThe big African apes had dropped the “business” of showing their teeth,\nand pretending that they wanted to tear the spectators' faces off. They\nwere carefully and painstakingly trying to fix up a kind of rustic seat\nin the corner of their cage with a short piece of board, which they\nplaced against the wall. This fell down every time they sat on it, and\nthe whole adjustment had to be gone through again.\n\nThe camel had stretched himself full length on the tan, and was enjoying\na luxurious snooze, oblivious of the fact that before long he would\nhave to get up and assume that far-off ship-of-the-desert aspect. The\nremainder of the animals were, like actors, “resting” before their\n“turn” came on; even the elephant had ceased to sway about, while a\nsmall monkey, asleep on a sloping tent pole, had an attack of nightmare\nand would have fallen off his perch but for his big tail. It was a land\nof the Lotus-eater\n\n    “In which it seemed always afternoon.”\n\nThese visions were dispelled by the entry of a person who said, “D'ye\nwant to see Dan?” and soon Dan Fitzgerald, the man who knows all\nabout the training of horses, came into the tent with Montgomery, the\nringmaster, and between them they proceeded to expound the methods of\ntraining horseflesh.\n\n“What sort of horse do we buy for circus work? Well, it depends what we\nwant 'em for. There are three sorts of horses in use in a circus--ring\nhorses, trick horses, and school horses; but it doesn't matter what he\nis wanted for, a horse is all the better if he knows nothing. A horse\nthat has been pulled about and partly trained has to unlearn a lot\nbefore he is any use to us. The less he knows, the better it is.”\n\n“Then do you just try any sort of horse?”\n\n“Any sort, so long as he is a good sort, but it depends on what he is\nwanted for. If we want a ring horse, he has to be a quiet sober-going\nanimal, not too well-bred and fiery. A ring horse is one that just goes\nround the ring for the bareback riders and equestriennes to perform\non. The human being is the “star”, and the horse in only a secondary\nperformer, a sort of understudy; yes, that's it, an understudy--he has\nto study how to keep under the man.”\n\n“Are they hard to train?”\n\n“Their work all depends on the men that ride them. In bareback riding\nthere's a knack in jumping on the horse. If a man lands awkwardly and\njars the horse's back, the horse will get out of step and flinch at each\njump, and he isn't nearly so good to perform on. A ring horse must\nnot swerve or change his pace; if you're up in the air, throwing a\nsomersault, and the horse swerves from underneath you--where are you?”\n\n“Some people think that horses take a lot of notice of the band--is that\nso?”\n\n“Not that I know of. If there are any horses in the show with an ear\nfor music, I haven't heard of them. They take a lot of notice of the\nringmaster.”\n\n“Does it take them long to learn this work?”\n\n“Not long; a couple of months will teach a ring horse; of course, some\nare better than others.”\n\n“First of all we teach them to come up to you, with the whip, like\nhorsebreakers do. Then we run them round the ring with a lunging rein\nfor a long time; then, when they are steady to the ring, we let them\nrun with the rein loose, and the trainer can catch hold of it if they go\nwrong. Then we put a roller on them--a broad surcingle that goes round\nthe horse's body--and the boys jump on them and canter round, holding\non to the roller, or standing up, lying down, and doing tricks till the\nhorse gets used to it.”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“Well, you give 'em a couple of hours of it, perhaps, and then dry them\nand feed them, and give them a spell, and then bring them out again.\nThey soon get to know what you want; but you can't break in horses on\nthe move. The shifting and worry and noise and excitement put it all out\nof their heads. We have a fixed camp where we break them in. And a horse\nmay know his work perfectly well when there is no one about, but bring\nhim into the ring at night, and he is all abroad.”\n\n“Do you have to give them much whip?”\n\n“Not much. If a horse doesn't know what you want him to do, it only\nruins him to whip him. But once he does a thing a few times, and then\nwon't do it, then you must whip him.”\n\n“What about trick horses?”\n\n“A trick horse rolls a barrel, or lies down and goes to bed with the\nclown, or fires a pistol--does any trick like that. Some small circuses\nmake the same horses do both trick and ring work, but it isn't a good\nline. A horse is all the better to have only one line of business--same\nas a man.”\n\n“How do you teach them tricks?”\n\n“Oh, it takes a long time and a lot of hard work and great patience.\nEven to make a horse lie down when he's ordered takes a couple of months\nsometimes. To make a horse lie down, you strap up one leg, and then pull\nhis head round; after a while he gets so tired of the strained position\nthat he lies down, after which he learns to do it at command. If you\nwant him to pick up a handkerchief, you put a bit of carrot in it, and\nafter a while they know that you want them to pick it up--but it takes\na long time. Then a strange hand in the ring will flurry them, and if\nanything goes wrong, they get all abroad. A good active pony, with a bit\nof Arab blood in him, is the best for tricks.”\n\n“What's a school horse?”\n\n“Ah, that's a line of business that isn't appreciated enough out here.\nOn the Continent they think a lot of them. A school horse is one that is\ntaught to do passaging, to change his feet at command, to move sideways\nand backwards; in fact, to drill. Out here no one thinks much of it. But\nin Germany, where everyone goes through military riding schools, they\ndo. The Germans are the best horse-trainers in the world; and the big\nGerman circus-proprietors have men to do all their business for them,\nwhile they just attend to the horses.”\n\n“How long does it take to turn out a school horse?”\n\n“Well, Chiarini was the best trainer out here, and he used to take two\nyears to get a horse to his satisfaction. For school horses, you must\nhave thoroughbreds, because their appearance is half their success. We\nhad a New Zealand thoroughbred that had raced, and was turning out a\nsplendid school horse, and he got burnt after costing a year's training.\nThat's the luck of the game, you know. You keep at it year after year,\nand sometimes they die, and sometimes they get crippled--it's all in the\nluck of the game. You may give fifty pounds for a horse, and find that\nhe can never get over his fear of the elephant, while you give ten\npounds for another, and find him a ready-made performer almost.”\n\nWe passed out through the ghostly circus and the menagerie tent down to\nthe stable tent. There, among a lot of others, a tranquil-looking animal\nwas munching some feed, while in front of him hung a placard, “Tiger\nHorse”.\n\n“That's a new sort! What is he, ring, trick, or school horse?”\n\n“Well, he's a class by himself. I suppose you'd call him a ring horse.\nThat's the horse that the tiger rides on.”\n\n“Did it take him long to learn that?”\n\n“Well, it did not take this horse long; but we tried eleven others\nbefore we could get one to stand it. They're just like men, all\ndifferent. What one will stand another won't look at. Well, good-bye.”\n\nJust like men--no doubt; most men have to carry tigers of various sorts\nthrough life to get a living.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CAT\n\n\nMost people think that the cat is an unintelligent animal, fond of ease,\nand caring little for anything but mice and milk. But a cat has really\nmore character than most human beings, and gets a great deal more\nsatisfaction out of life. Of all the animal kingdom, the cat has the\nmost many-sided character.\n\nHe--or she--is an athlete, a musician, an acrobat, a Lothario, a grim\nfighter, a sport of the first water. All day long the cat loafs about\nthe house, takes things easy, sleeps by the fire, and allows himself\nto be pestered by the attentions of our womenfolk and annoyed by our\nchildren. To pass the time away he sometimes watches a mouse-hole for\nan hour or two--just to keep himself from dying of ennui; and people get\nthe idea that this sort of thing is all that life holds for the cat.\nBut watch him as the shades of evening fall, and you see the cat as he\nreally is.\n\nWhen the family sits down to tea, the cat usually puts in an appearance\nto get his share, and purrs noisily, and rubs himself against the\nlegs of the family; and all the time he is thinking of a fight or a\nlove-affair that is coming off that evening. If there is a guest at\ntable the cat is particularly civil to him, because the guest is likely\nto have the best of what is going. Sometimes, instead of recognizing\nthis civility with something to eat, the guest stoops down and strokes\nthe cat, and says, “Poor pussy! poor pussy!”\n\nThe cat soon tires of that; he puts up his claw and quietly but firmly\nrakes the guest in the leg.\n\n“Ow!” says the guest, “the cat stuck his claws into me!” The delighted\nfamily remarks, “Isn't it sweet of him? Isn't he intelligent? _He wants\nyou to give him something to eat_.”\n\nThe guest dares not do what he would like to do--kick the cat through\nthe window--so, with tears of rage and pain in his eyes, he affects\nto be very much amused, and sorts out a bit of fish from his plate and\nhands it down. The cat gingerly receives it, with a look in his\neyes that says: “Another time, my friend, you won't be so dull of\ncomprehension,” and purrs maliciously as he retires to a safe distance\nfrom the guest's boot before eating it. A cat isn't a fool--not by a\nlong way.\n\nWhen the family has finished tea, and gathers round the fire to enjoy\nthe hours of indigestion, the cat slouches casually out of the room and\ndisappears. Life, true life, now begins for him.\n\nHe saunters down his own backyard, springs to the top of the fence with\none easy bound, drops lightly down on the other side, trots across the\nright-of-way to a vacant allotment, and skips to the roof of an empty\nshed. As he goes, he throws off the effeminacy of civilisation; his gait\nbecomes lithe and pantherlike; he looks quickly and keenly from side to\nside, and moves noiselessly, for he has so many enemies--dogs, cabmen\nwith whips, and small boys with stones.\n\nArrived on the top of the shed, the cat arches his back, rakes his claws\nonce or twice through the soft bark of the old roof, wheels round and\nstretches himself a few times; just to see that every muscle is in full\nworking order; then, dropping his head nearly to his paws, he sends\nacross a league of backyards his call to his kindred--a call to love, or\nwar, or sport.\n\nBefore long they come, gliding, graceful shadows, approaching\ncircuitously, and halting occasionally to reconnoitre--tortoiseshell,\ntabby, and black, all domestic cats, but all transformed for the nonce\ninto their natural state. No longer are they the hypocritical, meek\ncreatures who an hour ago were cadging for fish and milk. They are now\nruffling, swaggering blades with a Gascon sense of dignity. Their fights\nare grim and determined, and a cat will be clawed to ribbons before he\nwill yield.\n\nEven young lady cats have this inestimable superiority over human\nbeings, that they can work off jealousy, hatred, and malice in a\nsprawling, yelling combat on a flat roof. All cats fight, and all keep\nthemselves more or less in training while they are young. Your cat may\nbe the acknowledged lightweight champion of his district--a Griffo of\nthe feline ring!\n\nJust think how much more he gets out of his life than you do out of\nyours--what a hurricane of fighting and lovemaking his life is--and\nblush for yourself. You have had one little love-affair, and never had a\ngood, all-out fight in your life!\n\nAnd the sport they have, too! As they get older and retire from the ring\nthey go in for sport more systematically; the suburban backyards, that\nare to us but dullness indescribable, are to them hunting-grounds and\ntrysting-places where they may have more gallant adventure than ever had\nKing Arthur's knights or Robin Hood's merry men.\n\nGrimalkin decides to kill a canary in a neighbouring verandah. Consider\nthe fascination of it--the stealthy reconnaissance from the top of the\nfence; the care to avoid waking the house-dog, the noiseless approach\nand the hurried dash, and the fierce clawing at the fluttering bird till\nits mangled body is dragged through the bars of the cage; the exultant\nretreat with the spoil; the growling over the feast that follows. Not\nthe least entertaining part of it is the demure satisfaction of arriving\nhome in time for breakfast and hearing the house-mistress say: “Tom must\nbe sick; he seems to have no appetite.”\n\nIt is always levelled as a reproach against cats that they are more fond\nof their home than of the people in it. Naturally, the cat doesn't like\nto leave his country, the land where all his friends are, and where he\nknows every landmark. Exiled in a strange land, he would have to learn a\nnew geography, to exploit another tribe of dogs, to fight and make love\nto an entirely new nation of cats. Life isn't long enough for that sort\nof thing. So, when the family moves, the cat, if allowed, will stay at\nthe old house and attach himself to the new tenants. He will give them\nthe privilege of boarding him while he enjoys life in his own way. He\nis not going to sacrifice his whole career for the doubtful reward which\nfidelity to his old master or mistress might bring.\n\n\n\n\nSITTING IN JUDGMENT\n\n\nThe show ring was a circular enclosure of about four acres, with a\nspiked batten fence round it, and a listless crowd of back-country\nsettlers propped along the fence. Behind them were the sheds for\nproduce, and the machinery sections where steam threshers and earth\nscoops hummed and buzzed and thundered unnoticed. Crowds of sightseers\nwandered past the cattle stalls to gape at the fat bullocks; side-shows\nflourished, a blase goose drew marbles out of a tin canister, and a\nboxing showman displayed his muscles outside his tent, while his partner\nurged the youth of the district to come in and be thumped for the\nedification of the spectators.\n\nSuddenly a gate opened at the end of the show ring, and horses, cattle,\ndogs, vehicles, motor-cars, and bicyclists crowded into the arena. This\nwas the general parade, but it would have been better described as a\ngeneral chaos. Trotting horses and ponies, in harness, went whirling\nround the ring, every horse and every driver fully certain that\nevery eye was fixed on them; the horses--the vainest creatures in the\nworld--arching their necks and lifting their feet, whizzed past in\nbewildering succession, till the onlookers grew giddy. Inside the\nwhirling circle blood stallions stood on their hind legs, screaming\ndefiance to the world at large; great shaggy-fronted bulls, with dull\nvindictive eyes, paced along, looking as though they were trying to\nremember who it was that struck them last. A showground bull always\nseems to be nursing a grievance.\n\nMixed up with the stallions and bulls were dogs and donkeys. The dogs\nwere led by attendants, apparently selected on the principle of the\nlarger the dog the smaller the custodian; while the donkeys were the\nonly creatures unmoved by their surroundings, for they slept peaceably\nthrough the procession, occasionally waking up to bray their sense of\nboredom.\n\nIn the centre of the ring a few lady-riders, stern-featured women for\nthe most part, were being “judged” by a trembling official, who feared\nto look them in the face, but hurriedly and apologetically examined\nhorses and saddles, whispered his award to the stewards, and fled at\ntop speed to the official stand--his sanctuary from the fury of spurned\nbeauty. The defeated ladies immediately began to “perform”--that is, to\nask the universe at large whether anyone ever heard the like of that!\nBut the stewards strategically slipped away, and the injured innocents\nhad no resource left but to ride haughtily round the ring, glaring\ndefiance at the spectators.\n\nAll this time stewards and committee-men were wandering among the\ncompetitors, trying to find the animals for judgment. The clerk of the\nring--a huge man on a small cob--galloped around, roaring like a\nbull: “This way for the fourteen stone 'acks! Come on, you twelve\n'and ponies!” and by degrees various classes got judged, and dispersed\ngrumbling. Then the bulls filed out with their grievances still\nunsettled, the lady riders were persuaded to withdraw, and the clerk of\nthe ring sent a sonorous bellow across the ground: “Where's the jumpin'\njudges?”\n\nFrom the official stand came a brisk, dark-faced, wiry little man. He\nhad been a steeplechase rider and a trainer in his time. Long experience\nof that tricky animal, the horse, had made him reserved and slow to\nexpress an opinion. He mounted the table, and produced a note-book.\nFrom the bar of the booth came a large, hairy, red-faced man, whose face\nshowed fatuous self-complacency. He was a noted show-judge because he\nrefused, on principle, to listen to others' opinions; or in those rare\ncases when he did, only to eject a scornful contradiction. The third\njudge was a local squatter, who was overwhelmed with a sense of his own\nimportance.\n\nThey seated themselves on a raised platform in the centre of the ring,\nand held consultation. The small dark man produced his note-book.\n\n“I always keep a scale of points,” he said. “Give 'em so many points for\neach fence. Then give 'em so many for make, shape, and quality, and so\nmany for the way they jump.”\n\nThe fat man looked infinite contempt. “I never want any scale of\npoints,” he said. “One look at the 'orses is enough for me. A man that\njudges by points ain't a judge at all, I reckon. What do you think?” he\nwent on, turning to the squatter. “Do you go by points?”\n\n“Never,” said the squatter, firmly; which, as he had never judged before\nin his life, was strictly true.\n\n“Well, we'll each go our own way,” said the little man. “I'll keep\npoints. Send 'em in.”\n\n“Number One, Conductor!” roared the ring steward in a voice like\nthunder, and a long-legged grey horse came trotting into the ring and\nsidled about uneasily. His rider pointed him for the first jump, and\nwent at it at a terrific pace. Nearing the fence the horse made a wild\nspring, and cleared it by feet, while the crowd yelled applause. At the\nsecond jump he raced right under the obstacle, propped dead, and rose\nin the air with a leap like a goat, while the crowd yelled their delight\nagain, and said: “My oath! ain't he clever?” As he neared the third\nfence he shifted about uneasily, and finally took it at an angle,\nclearing a wholly unnecessary thirty feet. Again the hurricane of cheers\nbroke out. “Don't he fly 'em,” said one man, waving his hat. At the\nlast fence he made his spring yards too soon; his forelegs got over all\nright, but his hind legs dropped on the rail with a sounding rap, and he\nleft a little tuft of hair sticking on it.\n\n“I like to see 'em feel their fences,” said the fat man. “I had a\nbay 'orse once, and he felt every fence he ever jumped; shows their\nconfidence.”\n\n“I think he'll feel that last one for a while,” said the little dark\nman. “What's this now?”\n\n“Number Two, Homeward Bound!” An old, solid chestnut horse came out and\ncantered up to each jump, clearing them coolly and methodically. The\ncrowd was not struck by the performance, and the fat man said: “No\npace!” but surreptitiously made two strokes (to indicate Number Two) on\nthe cuff of his shirt.\n\n“Number Eleven, Spite!” This was a leggy, weedy chestnut,\nhalf-racehorse, half-nondescript, ridden by a terrified amateur, who\nwent at the fence with a white, set face. The horse raced up to the\nfence, and stopped dead, amid the jeers of the crowd. The rider let\ndaylight into him with his spurs, and rushed him at it again. This time\nhe got over.\n\nRound he went, clouting some fences with his front legs, others with\nhis hind legs. The crowd jeered, but the fat man, from a sheer spirit\nof opposition, said: “That would be a good horse if he was rode better.”\n And the squatter remarked: “Yes, he belongs to a young feller just near\nme. I've seen him jump splendidly out in the bush, over brush fences.”\n\nThe little dark man said nothing, but made a note in his book.\n\n“Number Twelve, Gaslight!” “Now, you'll see a horse,” said the fat man.\n“I've judged this 'orse in twenty different shows, and gave him first\nprize every time!”\n\nGaslight turned out to be a fiddle-headed, heavy-shouldered brute, whose\nlong experience of jumping in shows where they give points for pace--as\nif the affair was a steeplechase--had taught him to get the business\nover as quickly as he could. He went thundering round the ring, pulling\ndouble, and standing off his fences in a style that would infallibly\nbring him to grief if following hounds across roads or through broken\ntimber.\n\n“Now,” said the fat man, “that's a 'unter, that is. What I say is, when\nyou come to judge at a show, pick out the 'orse you'd soonest be on if\nNed Kelly was after you, and there you have the best 'unter.”\n\nThe little man did not reply, but made the usual scrawl in his book,\nwhile the squatter hastened to agree with the fat man. “I like to see a\nbit of pace myself,” he ventured.\n\nThe fat man sat on him heavily. “You don't call that pace, do you?” he\nsaid. “He was going dead slow.”\n\nVarious other competitors did their turn round the ring, some propping\nand bucking over the jumps, others rushing and tearing at their fences;\nnot one jumped as a hunter should. Some got themselves into difficulties\nby changing feet or misjudging the distance, and were loudly applauded\nby the crowd for “cleverness” in getting themselves out of the\ndifficulties they had themselves created.\n\nA couple of rounds narrowed the competitors down to a few, and the task\nof deciding was entered on.\n\n“I have kept a record,” said the little man, “of how they jumped each\nfence, and I give them points for style of jumping, and for their make\nand shape and hunting qualities. The way I bring it out is that Homeward\nBound is the best, with Gaslight second.”\n\n“Homeward Bound!” said the fat man. “Why, the pace he went wouldn't head\na duck. He didn't go as fast as a Chinaman could trot with two baskets\nof stones. I want to have three of 'em in to have another look at\n'em.” Here he looked surreptitiously at his cuff, saw a note “No. II.”,\nmistook it for “Number Eleven”, and said: “I want Number Eleven to go\nanother round.”\n\nThe leggy, weedy chestnut, with the terrified amateur up, came sidling\nand snorting out into the ring. The fat man looked at him with scorn.\n\n“What is that fiddle-headed brute doing in the ring?” he said.\n\n“Why,” said the ring steward, “you said you wanted him.”\n\n“Well,” said the fat man, “if I said I wanted him I do want him. Let him\ngo the round.”\n\nThe terrified amateur went at his fences with the rashness of despair,\nand narrowly escaped being clouted off on two occasions. This put the\nfat man in a quandary. He had kept no record, and all the horses were\njumbled up in his head; but he had one fixed idea, to give the first\nprize to Gaslight; as to the second he was open to argument. From sheer\ncontrariness he said that Number Eleven would be “all right if he were\nrode better,” and the squatter agreed. The little man was overruled, and\nthe prizes went--Gaslight, first; Spite, second; Homeward Bound, third.\n\nThe crowd hooted loudly as Spite's rider came round with the second\nribbon, and small boys suggested to the fat judge in shrill tones that\nhe ought to boil his head. The fat man stalked majestically into the\nstewards' stand, and on being asked how he came to give Spite the\nsecond prize, remarked oracularly: “I judge the 'orse, I don't judge the\nrider.” This silenced criticism, and everyone adjourned to have a drink.\n\nOver the flowing bowl the fat man said: “You see, I don't believe in\nthis nonsense about points. I can judge 'em without that.”\n\nTwenty dissatisfied competitors vowed they would never bring another\nhorse there in their lives. Gaslight's owner said: “Blimey, I knew it\nwould be all right with old Billy judging. 'E knows this 'orse.”\n\n\n\n\nTHE DOG\n\n\nThe dog is a member of society who likes to have his day's work, and who\ndoes it more conscientiously than most human beings. A dog always looks\nas if he ought to have a pipe in his mouth and a black bag for his\nlunch, and then he would go quite happily to office every day.\n\nA dog without work is like a man without work, a nuisance to himself and\neverybody else. People who live about town, and keep a dog to give the\nchildren hydatids and to keep the neighbours awake at night, imagine\nthat the animal is fulfilling his destiny. All town dogs, fancy dogs,\nshow dogs, lap-dogs, and other dogs with no work to do, should be\nabolished; it is only in the country that a dog has any justification\nfor his existence.\n\nThe old theory that animals have only instinct, not reason, to guide\nthem, is knocked endways by the dog. A dog can reason as well as a human\nbeing on some subjects, and better on others, and the best reasoning dog\nof all is the sheep-dog. The sheep-dog is a professional artist with a\npride in his business. Watch any drover's dogs bringing sheep into\nthe yards. How thoroughly they feel their responsibility, and how very\nannoyed they get if a stray dog with no occupation wants them to stop\nand fool about! They snap at him and hurry off, as much as to say: “You\ngo about your idleness. Don't you see this is my busy day?”\n\nSheep-dogs are followers of Thomas Carlyle. They hold that the only\nhappiness for a dog in this life is to find his work and to do it. The\nidle, 'dilettante', non-working, aristocratic dog they have no use for.\n\nThe training of a sheep-dog for his profession begins at a very early\nage. The first thing is to take him out with his mother and let him see\nher working. He blunders lightheartedly, frisking along in front of the\nhorse, and his owner tries to ride over him, and generally succeeds. It\nis amusing to see how that knocks all the gas out of a puppy, and with\nwhat a humble air he falls to the rear and glues himself to the horse's\nheels, scarcely daring to look to the right or to the left, for fear of\ncommitting some other breach of etiquette.\n\nHe has had his first lesson--to keep behind the horse until he is\nwanted. Then he watches the old slut work, and is allowed to go with her\nround the sheep; and if he shows any disposition to get out of hand\nand frolic about, the old lady will bite him sharply to prevent his\ninterfering with her work.\n\nBy degrees, slowly, like any other professional, he learns his business.\nHe learns to bring sheep after a horse simply at a wave of the hand;\nto force the mob up to a gate where they can be counted or drafted;\nto follow the scent of lost sheep, and to drive sheep through a town\nwithout any master, one dog going on ahead to block the sheep from\nturning off into by-streets while the other drives them on from the\nrear.\n\nHow do they learn all these things? Dogs for show work are taught\npainstakingly by men who are skilled in handling them; but, after all,\nthey teach themselves more than the men teach them. It looks as if the\nacquired knowledge of generations were transmitted from dog to dog.\nThe puppy, descended from a race of sheep-dogs, starts with all his\nfaculties directed towards the working of sheep; he is half-educated\nas soon as he is born. He can no more help working sheep than a born\nmusician can help being musical, or a Hebrew can help gathering in\nshekels. It is bred in him. If he can't get sheep to work, he will\nwork a fowl; often and often one can see a collie pup painstakingly and\ncarefully driving a bewildered old hen into a stable, or a stock-yard,\nor any other enclosed space on which he has fixed his mind. How does he\nlearn to do that? He didn't learn it at all. The knowledge was born with\nhim.\n\nWhen the dog has been educated, or has educated himself, he enjoys his\nwork; but very few dogs like work “in the yards”. The sun is hot,\nthe dust rises in clouds, and there is nothing to do but bark, bark,\nbark--which is all very well for learners and amateurs, but is beneath\nthe dignity of the true professional sheep-dog. When they are hoarse\nwith barking and nearly choked with dust, the men lose their tempers and\nswear at them, and throw clods of earth at them, and sing out to them\n“Speak up, blast you!”\n\nThen the dogs suddenly decide that they have done enough for the day.\nWatching their opportunity, they silently steal over the fence, and\nhide in any cool place they can find. After a while the men notice that\nhardly any are left, and operations are suspended while a great hunt is\nmade into outlying pieces of cover, where the dogs are sure to be found\nlying low and looking as guilty as so many thieves. A clutch at the\nscruff of the neck, a kick in the ribs, and they are hauled out of\nhiding-places; and accompany their masters to the yard frolicking about\nand pretending that they are quite delighted to be going back, and\nonly hid in those bushes out of sheer thoughtlessness. He is a champion\nhypocrite, is the dog.\n\nDogs, like horses, have very keen intuition. They know when the men\naround them are frightened, though they may not know the cause. In a\ngreat Queensland strike, when the shearers attacked and burnt Dagworth\nshed, some rifle-volleys were exchanged. The air was full of human\nelectricity, each man giving out waves of fear and excitement. Mark now\nthe effect it had on the dogs. They were not in the fighting; nobody\nfired at them, and nobody spoke to them; but every dog left his master,\nleft the sheep, and went away to the homestead, about six miles off.\nThere wasn't a dog about the shed next day after the fight. The noise of\nthe rifles had not frightened them, because they were well-accustomed to\nthat.*\n\n     * The same thing happened constantly with horses in the\n     South African War. A loose horse would feed contentedly\n     while our men were firing, but when our troops were being\n     fired at the horses became uneasy, and the loose ones would\n     trot away. The excitement of the men communicated itself to\n     them.\n\nDogs have an amazing sense of responsibility. Sometimes, when there are\nsheep to be worked, an old slut who has young puppies may be greatly\nexercised in her mind whether she should go out or not. On the one hand,\nshe does not care about leaving the puppies, on the other, she feels\nthat she really ought to go rather than allow the sheep to be knocked\nabout by those learners. Hesitatingly, with many a look behind her, she\ntrots out after the horses and the other dogs. An impassioned appeal\nfrom the head boundary rider, “Go back home, will yer!” is treated with\nthe contempt it deserves. She goes out to the yards, works, perhaps half\nthe day, and then slips quietly under the fences and trots off home,\ncontented.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DOG--AS A SPORTSMAN\n\n\nThe sheep-dog and the cattle-dog are the workmen of the animal kingdom;\nsporting and fighting dogs are the professionals and artists.\n\nA house-dog or a working-dog will only work for his master; a\nprofessional or artistic dog will work for anybody, so long as he is\ntreated like an artist. A man going away for a week's shooting can\nborrow a dog, and the dog will work for him loyally, just as a good\nmusician will do his best, though the conductor is strange to him, and\nthe other members of the band are not up to the mark. The musician's\nart is sacred to him, and that is the case with the dog--Art before\neverything.\n\nIt is a grand sight to see a really good setter or pointer working up to\na bird, occasionally glancing over his shoulder to see if the man with\nthe gun has not lost himself. He throws his whole soul into his work,\nquesting carefully over the cold scent, feathering eagerly when the bird\nis close, and at last drawing up like a statue. Not Paganini himself\never lost himself in his art more thoroughly than does humble Spot or\nPonto. It is not amusement and not a mere duty to him; it is a sacred\ngift, which he is bound to exercise.\n\nA pointer in need of amusement will play with another dog--the pair\npretending to fight, and so on, but when there is work to be done, the\ndog is lost in the artist. How crestfallen he looks if by any chance he\nblunders on to a bird without pointing it! A fiddler who has played\na wrong note in a solo is the only creature who can look quite so\ndiscomfited. Humanity, instead of going to the ant for wisdom, should\ncertainly go to the dog.\n\nSporting dogs are like other artists, in that they are apt to get\ncareless of everything except their vocation. They are similarly quite\nunreliable in their affections. They are not good watch dogs, and take\nlittle interest in chasing cats. They look on a little dog that catches\nrats much as a great musician looks on a cricketer--it's clever, but it\nisn't Art.\n\nHunting and fighting dogs are the gladiators of the animal world.\nA fox-hound or a kangaroo-dog is always of the same opinion as Mr.\nJorrocks:--“All time is wasted what isn't spent in 'untin'.”\n\nA greyhound will start out in the morning with three lame legs, but as\nsoon as he sees a hare start he _must_ go. He utterly forgets his sorrows\nin the excitement, just as a rowing-man, all over boils and blisters,\nwill pull a desperate race without feeling any pain. Such dogs are not\neasily excited by anything but a chase, and a burglar might come and rob\nthe house and murder the inmates without arousing any excitement among\nthem. Guarding a house is “not their pidgin” as the Chinese say. That\nis one great reason for the success of the dog at whatever branch of his\ntribe's work he goes in for--he is so thorough. Dogs who are forced to\ncombine half-a-dozen professions never make a success at anything. One\ndog one billet is their motto.\n\nThe most earnest and thorough of all the dog tribe is the fighting\ndog. His intense self-respect, his horror of brawling, his cool\ndetermination, make him a pattern to humanity. The bull-dog or\nbull-terrier is generally the most friendly and best-tempered dog in the\nworld; but when he is put down in the ring he fights till he drops, in\ngrim silence, though his feet are bitten through and through, his ears\nare in rags, and his neck a hideous mass of wounds.\n\nIn a well-conducted dog-fight each dog in turn has to attack the other\ndog, and one can see fierce earnestness blazing in the eye of the\nattacker as he hurls himself on the foe. What makes him fight like\nthat? It is not bloodthirstiness, because they are neither savage nor\nquarrelsome dogs: a bulldog will go all his life without a fight, unless\nput into a ring. It is simply their strong self-respect and stubborn\npride which will not let them give in. The greyhound snaps at his\nopponent and then runs for his life, but the fighting dog stands to it\ntill death.\n\nJust occasionally one sees the same type of human being--some\nquiet-spoken, good-tempered man who has taken up glove-fighting for a\nliving, and who, perhaps, gets pitted against a man a shade better than\nhimself. After a few rounds he knows he is overmatched, but there is\nsomething at the back of his brain that will not let him cave in. Round\nafter round he stands punishment, and round after round he grimly comes\nup, till, possibly, his opponent loses heart, or a fluky hit turns the\nscale in his favour. These men are to be found in every class of life.\nMany of the gamest of the game are mere gutter-bred boys who will\ncontinue to fight long after they have endured enough punishment to\nentitle them to quit.\n\nYou can see in their eyes the same hard glitter that shows in the\nbulldog's eyes as he limps across the ring, or in the eye of the\nracehorse as he lies down to it when his opponent is outpacing him. It\nis grit, pluck, vim, nerve force; call it what you like, and there is no\ncreated thing that has more of it than the dog.\n\nThe blood-lust is a dog-phase that has never been quite understood.\nEvery station-owner knows that sometimes the house-dogs are liable to\ntake a sudden fit of sheep-killing. Any kind of dog will do it, from the\ncollie downward. Sometimes dogs from different homesteads meet in the\npaddocks, having apparently arranged the whole affair beforehand. They\nare very artful about it, too. They lie round the house till dark, and\nthen slink off and have a wild night's blood-spree, running down the\nwretched sheep and tearing their throats open; before dawn they\nslink back again and lie around the house as before. Many and many a\nsheep-owner has gone out with a gun and shot his neighbour's dogs for\nkilling sheep which his own wicked, innocent-looking dogs had slain.\n\n\n\n\nCONCERNING A STEEPLECHASE RIDER\n\n\nOf all the ways in which men get a living there is none so hard and so\nprecarious as that of steeplechase-riding in Australia. It is bad enough\nin England, where steeplechases only take place in winter, when the\nground is soft, where the horses are properly schooled before being\nraced, and where most of the obstacles will yield a little if struck and\ngive the horse a chance to blunder over safely.\n\nIn Australia the men have to go at racing-speed, on very hard ground,\nover the most rigid and uncompromising obstacles--ironbark rails clamped\ninto solid posts with bands of iron. No wonder they are always coming\nto grief, and are always in and out of hospital in splints and bandages.\nSometimes one reads that a horse has fallen and the rider has “escaped\nwith a severe shaking.”\n\nThat “shaking”, gentle reader, would lay you or me up for weeks, with\na doctor to look after us and a crowd of sympathetic friends calling to\nknow how our poor back was. But the steeplechase-rider has to be out and\nabout again, “riding exercise” every morning, and “schooling” all sorts\nof cantankerous brutes over the fences. These men take their lives in\ntheir hands and look at grim death between their horses' ears every time\nthey race or “school”.\n\nThe death-record among Australian cross-country jockeys and horses is\nvery great; it is a curious instance of how custom sanctifies all things\nthat such horse-and-man slaughter is accepted in such a callous way. If\nany theatre gave a show at which men and horses were habitually crippled\nor killed in full sight of the audience, the manager would be put on his\ntrial for manslaughter.\n\nOur race-tracks use up their yearly average of horses and men without\nattracting remark. One would suppose that the risk being so great the\nprofits were enormous; but they are not. In “the game” as played on\nour racecourses there is just a bare living for a good capable horseman\nwhile he lasts, with the certainty of an ugly smash if he keeps at it\nlong enough.\n\nAnd they don't need to keep at it very long. After a few good “shakings”\n they begin to take a nip or two to put heart into them before they go\nout, and after a while they have to increase the dose. At last they\ncannot ride at all without a regular cargo of alcohol on board, and are\neither “half-muzzy” or shaky according as they have taken too much or\ntoo little.\n\nThen the game becomes suicidal; it is an axiom that as soon as a man\nbegins to funk he begins to fall. The reason is that a rider who has\nlost his nerve is afraid of his horse making a mistake, and takes a\npull, or urges him onward, just at the crucial moment when the horse is\nrattling up to his fence and judging his distance. That little, nervous\npull at his head or that little touch of the spur, takes his attention\nfrom the fence, with the result that he makes his spring a foot too far\noff or a foot too close in, and--smash!\n\nThe loafers who hang about the big fences rush up to see if the jockey\nis killed or stunned; if he is, they dispose of any jewellery he may\nhave about him; they have been known almost to tear a finger off in\ntheir endeavours to secure a ring. The ambulance clatters up at a\ncanter, the poor rider is pushed in out of sight, and the ladies in the\nstand say how unlucky they are--that brute of a horse falling after\nthey backed him. A wolfish-eyed man in the Leger-stand shouts to\na wolfish-eyed pal, “Bill, I believe that jock was killed when the\nchestnut fell,” and Bill replies, “Yes, damn him, I had five bob on\nhim.” And the rider, gasping like a crushed chicken, is carried into the\ncasualty-room and laid on a little stretcher, while outside the window\nthe bookmakers are roaring “Four to one bar one,” and the racing is\ngoing on merrily as ever.\n\nThese remarks serve to introduce one of the fraternity who may be\nconsidered as typical of all. He was a small, wiry, hard-featured\nfellow, the son of a stockman on a big cattle-station, and began life as\na horse-breaker; he was naturally a horseman, able and willing to ride\nanything that could carry him. He left the station to go with cattle on\nthe road, and having picked up a horse that showed pace, amused himself\nby jumping over fences. Then he went to Wagga, entered the horse in a\nsteeplechase, rode him himself, won handsomely, sold the horse at a good\nprice to a Sydney buyer, and went down to ride it in his Sydney races.\n\nIn Sydney he did very well; he got a name as a fearless and clever\nrider, and was offered several mounts on fine animals. So he pitched\nhis camp in Sydney, and became a fully-enrolled member of the worst\nprofession in the world. I had known him in the old days on the road,\nand when I met him on the course one day I enquired how he liked the new\nlife.\n\n“Well, it's a livin',” he said, “but it's no great shakes. They don't\ngive steeplechase-riders a chance in Sydney. There's very few races, and\nthe big sweepstakes keep horses out of the game.”\n\n“Do you get a fair share of the riding?” I asked.\n\n“Oh, yes; I get as much as anybody. But there's a lot of 'em got a\nnotion I won't take hold of a horse when I'm told (i.e., pull him to\nprevent him winning). Some of these days I'll take hold of a horse when\nthey don't expect it.”\n\nI smiled as I thought there was probably a sorry day in store for some\nbacker when the jockey “took hold” unexpectedly.\n\n“Do you have to pull horses, then, to get employment?”\n\n“Oh, well, it's this way,” he said, rather apologetically, “if an owner\nis badly treated by the handicapper, and is just giving his horse a run\nto get weight off, then it's right enough to catch hold a bit. But when\na horse is favourite and the public are backing him it isn't right to\ntake hold of him then. _I_ would not do it.” This was his whole code of\nmorals--not to pull a favourite; and he felt himself very superior to\nthe scoundrel who would pull favourites or outsiders indiscriminately.\n\n“What do you get for riding?” I asked him.\n\n“Well,” he said, looking about uneasily, “we're supposed to get a\nfiver for a losing mount and ten pounds if we win, but a lot of the\nsteeplechase-owners are what I call 'battlers'--men who have no money\nand get along by owing everybody. They promise us all sorts of money if\nwe win, but they don't pay if we lose. I only got two pounds for that\nlast steeplechase.”\n\n“Two pounds!” I made a rapid calculation. He had ridden over eighteen\nfences for two pounds--had chanced his life eighteen times at less than\nhalf-a-crown a time.\n\n“Good Heavens!” I said, “that's a poor game. Wouldn't you be better back\non the station?”\n\n“Oh, I don't know--sometimes we get laid a bit to nothing, and do well\nout of a race. And then, you know, a steeplechase rider is somebody--not\nlike an ordinary fellow that is just working.”\n\nI realised that I was an “ordinary fellow who was just working”, and\nfelt small accordingly.\n\n“I'm just off to weigh now,” he said--“I'm riding Contractor, and he'll\nrun well, but he always seems to fall at those logs. Still, I ought to\nhave luck to-day. I met a hearse as I was coming out. I'll get him over\nthe fences, somehow.”\n\n“Do you think it lucky, then, to meet a hearse?”\n\n“Oh, yes,” he said, “if you _meet_ it. You mustn't overtake it--that's\nunlucky. So is a cross-eyed man unlucky. Cross-eyed men ought to be kept\noff racecourses.”\n\nHe reappeared clad in his racing rig, and we set off to see the horse\nsaddled. We found the owner in a great state of excitement. It seemed he\nhad no money--absolutely none whatever--but had borrowed enough to pay\nthe sweepstakes, and stood to make something if the horse won and lose\nnothing if he lost, as he had nothing to lose. My friend insisted on\nbeing paid two pounds before he would mount, and the owner nearly had a\nfit in his efforts to persuade him to ride on credit. At last a backer\nof the horse agreed to pay 2 pounds 10s., win or lose, and the rider was\nto get 25 pounds out of the prize if he won. So up he got; and as he and\nthe others walked the big muscular horses round the ring, nodding gaily\nto friends in the crowd, I thought of the gladiators going out to fight\nin the arena with the cry of “Hail, Caesar, those about to die salute\nthee!”\n\nThe story of the race is soon told. My friend went to the front at the\nstart and led nearly all the way, and “Contractor!” was on every one's\nlips as the big horse sailed along in front of his field. He came at the\nlog-fence full of running, and it looked certain that he would get over.\nBut at the last stride he seemed to falter, then plunged right into the\nfence, striking it with his chest, and, turning right over, landed on\nhis unfortunate rider.\n\nA crowd clustered round and hid horse and rider from view, and I ran\ndown to the casualty-room to meet him when the ambulance came in. The\nlimp form was carefully taken out and laid on a stretcher while a doctor\nexamined the crushed ribs, the broken arm, and all the havoc that the\nhorse's huge weight had wrought.\n\nThere was no hope from the first. My poor friend, who had so often faced\nDeath for two pounds, lay very still awhile. Then he began to talk,\nwandering in his mind, “Where are the cattle?”--his mind evidently going\nback to the old days on the road. Then, quickly, “Look out there--give\nme room!” and again “Five-and-twenty pounds, Mary, and a sure thing if\nhe don't fall at the logs.”\n\nMary was sobbing beside the bed, cursing the fence and the money that\nhad brought him to grief. At last, in a tone of satisfaction, he said,\nquite clear and loud: “I know how it was--_There couldn't have been any\ndead man in that hearse!_”\n\nAnd so, having solved the mystery to his own satisfaction, he drifted\naway into unconsciousness--and woke somewhere on the other side of the\nbig fence that we can neither see through nor over, but all have to face\nsooner or later.\n\n\n\n\nVICTOR SECOND\n\n\nWe were training two horses for the Buckatowndown races--an old grey\nwarrior called Tricolor--better known to the station boys as The\nTrickler--and a mare for the hack race. Station horses don't get trained\nquite like Carbine; some days we had no time to give them gallops at\nall, so they had to gallop twice as far the next day to make up.\n\nOne day the boy we had looking after The Trickler fell in with a mob of\nsharps who told him we didn't know anything about training horses, and\nthat what the horse really wanted was “a twicer”--that is to say, a\ngallop twice round the course. So the boy gave him “a twicer” on his own\nresponsibility. When we found out about it we gave the boy a twicer with\nthe strap, and he left and took out a summons against us. But somehow\nor other we managed to get the old horse pretty fit, tried him against\nhacks of different descriptions, and persuaded ourselves that we had the\nbiggest certainty ever known on a racecourse.\n\nWhen the horses were galloping in the morning the kangaroo-dog, Victor,\nnearly always went down to the course to run round with them. It amused\nhim, apparently, and didn't hurt anyone, so we used to let him race; in\nfact, we rather encouraged him, because it kept him in good trim to hunt\nkangaroo. When we were starting for the meeting, someone said we had\nbetter tie up Victor or he would be getting stolen at the races. We\ncalled and whistled, but he had made himself scarce, so we started and\nforgot all about him.\n\nBuckatowndown Races. Red-hot day, everything dusty, everybody drunk and\nblasphemous. All the betting at Buckatowndown was double-event--you had\nto win the money first, and fight the man for it afterwards.\n\nThe start for our race, the Town Plate, was delayed for a quarter of an\nhour because the starter flatly refused to leave a fight of which he was\nan interested spectator. Every horse, as he did his preliminary gallop,\nhad a string of dogs after him, and the clerk of the course came full\ncry after the dogs with a whip.\n\nBy and by the horses strung across to the start at the far side of the\ncourse. They fiddled about for a bit; then down went the flag and they\ncame sweeping along all bunched up together, one holding a nice\nposition on the inside. All of a sudden we heard a wild chorus of\nimprecations--“Look at that dog!” Victor had chipped in with the\nracehorses, and was running right in front of the field. It looked a\nguinea to a gooseberry that some of them would fall on him.\n\nThe owners danced and swore. What did we mean by bringing a something\nmongrel there to trip up and kill horses that were worth a paddockful of\nall the horses we had ever owned, or would ever breed or own, even if we\nlived to be a thousand. We were fairly in it and no mistake.\n\nAs the field came past the stand the first time we could hear the\nriders swearing at our dog, and a wild yell of execration arose from\nthe public. He had got right among the ruck by this time, and was racing\nalongside his friend The Trickler, thoroughly enjoying himself. After\npassing the stand the pace became very merry; the dog stretched out all\nhe knew; when they began to make it too hot for him, he cut off corners,\nand joined at odd intervals, and every time he made a fresh appearance\nthe people in the stand lifted up their voices and “swore cruel”.\n\nThe horses were all at the whip as they turned into the straight, and\nthen The Trickler and the publican's mare singled out. We could hear\nthe “chop, chop!” of the whips as they came along together, but the mare\ncould not suffer it as long as the old fellow, and she swerved off while\nhe struggled home a winner by a length or so. Just as they settled down\nto finish Victor dashed up on the inside, and passed the post at old\nTrickler's girths. The populace immediately went for him with stones,\nbottles, and other missiles, and he had to scratch gravel to save his\nlife. But imagine the amazement of the other owners when the judge\nplaced Trickler first, Victor second, and the publican's mare third!\n\nThe publican tried to argue it out with him. He said you couldn't place\na kangaroo-dog second in a horse-race.\n\nThe judge said it was _his_ (hiccough) business what he placed, and that\nthose who (hiccough) interfered with him would be sorry for it. Also he\nexpressed a (garnished) opinion that the publican's mare was no rotten\ngood, and that she was the right sort of mare for a poor man to own,\nbecause she would keep him poor.\n\nThen the publican called the judge a cow. The judge was willing; a rip,\ntear, and chew fight ensued, which lasted some time. The judge won.\n\nFifteen protests were lodged against our win, but we didn't worry about\nthat--we had laid the stewards a bit to nothing. Every second man we met\nwanted to run us a mile for 100 pounds a side; and a drunken shearer,\nspoiling for a fight, said he had heard we were “brimming over with\nbally science”, and had ridden forty miles to find out.\n\nWe didn't wait for the hack race. We folded our tents like the Arab\nand stole away. But it remains on the annals of Buckatowndown how a\nkangaroo-dog ran second for the Town Plate.\n\n\n\n\nCONCERNING A DOG-FIGHT\n\n\nDog-fighting as a sport is not much in vogue now-a-days. To begin with\nit is illegal. Not that _that_ matters much, for Sunday drinking is also\nillegal. But dog-fighting is one of the cruel sports which the\ncommunity has decided to put down with all the force of public opinion.\nNevertheless, a certain amount of it is still carried on near Sydney,\nand very neatly and scientifically carried on, too--principally by\ngentlemen who live out Botany way and do not care for public opinion.\n\nThe grey dawn was just breaking over Botany when we got to the\nmeeting-place. Away to the East the stars were paling in the faint flush\nof coming dawn, and over the sandhills came the boom of breakers. It was\nSunday morning, and all the respectable, non-dog-fighting population of\nthat odoriferous suburb were sleeping their heavy, Sunday-morning\nsleep. Some few people, however, were astir. In the dim light hurried\npedestrians plodded along the heavy road towards the sandhills. Now and\nthen a van, laden with ten or eleven of “the talent”, and drawn by a\nhorse that cost fifteen shillings at auction, rolled softly along in the\nsame direction. These were dog-fighters who had got “the office”, and\nknew exactly where the match was to take place.\n\nThe “meet” was on a main road, about half-a-mile from town; here some\ntwo hundred people had assembled, and hung up their horses and vehicles\nto the fence without the slightest concealment. They said the police\nwould not interfere with them--and they did not seem a nice crowd to\ninterfere with.\n\nOne dog was on the ground when we arrived, having come out in a hansom\ncab with his trainer. He was a white bull-terrier, weighing about forty\npounds, “trained to the hour”, with the muscles standing out all over\nhim. He waited in the cab, licking his trainer's face at intervals to\nreassure that individual of his protection and support; the rest of the\ntime he glowered out of the cab and eyed the public scornfully. He knew\nas well as any human being that there was sport afoot, and looked about\neagerly and wickedly to see what he could get his teeth into.\n\nSoon a messenger came running up to know whether they meant to sit in\nthe cab till the police came; the other dog, he said, had arrived and\nall was ready. The trainer and dog got out of the cab; we followed them\nthrough a fence and over a rise--and there, about twenty yards from\nthe main road, was a neatly-pitched enclosure like a prize-ring, a\nthirty-foot-square enclosure formed with stakes and ropes. About a\nhundred people were at the ringside, and in the far corner, in the arms\nof his trainer, was the other dog--a brindle.\n\nIt was wonderful to see the two dogs when they caught sight of each\nother. The white dog came up to the ring straining at his leash, nearly\ndragging his trainer off his feet in his efforts to get at the enemy. At\nintervals he emitted a hoarse roar of challenge and defiance.\n\nThe brindled dog never uttered a sound. He fixed his eyes on his\nadversary with a look of intense hunger, of absolute yearning for\ncombat. He never for an instant shifted his unwinking gaze. He seemed\nlike an animal who saw the hopes of years about to be realised. With\npainful earnestness he watched every detail of the other dog's toilet;\nand while the white dog was making fierce efforts to get at him, he\nstood Napoleonic, grand in his courage, waiting for the fray.\n\nAll details were carefully attended to, and all rules strictly\nobserved. People may think a dog-fight is a go-as-you-please outbreak of\nlawlessness, but there are rules and regulations--simple, but effective.\nThere were two umpires, a referee, a timekeeper, and two seconds for\neach dog. The stakes were said to be ten pounds a-side. After some talk,\nthe dogs were carried to the centre of the ring by their seconds and put\non the ground. Like a flash of lightning they dashed at each other, and\nthe fight began.\n\nNearly everyone has seen dogs fight--“it is their nature to”, as Dr.\nWatts put it. But an ordinary worry between (say) a retriever and a\ncollie, terminating as soon as one or other gets his ear bitten, gives\na very faint idea of a real dog-fight. But bull-terriers are the\ngladiators of the canine race. Bred and trained to fight, carefully\nexercised and dieted for weeks beforehand, they come to the fray\nexulting in their strength and determined to win. Each is trained to\nfight for certain holds, a grip of the ear or the back of the neck being\nof very slight importance. The foot is a favourite hold, the throat is,\nof course, fashionable--if they can get it.\n\nThe white and the brindle sparred and wrestled and gripped and threw\neach other, fighting grimly, and disdaining to utter a sound. Their\nseconds dodged round them unceasingly, giving them encouragement and\nadvice--“That's the style, Boxer--fight for his foot”--“Draw your foot\nback, old man,” and so on. Now and again one dog got a grip of the\nother's foot and chewed savagely, and the spectators danced with\nexcitement. The moment the dogs let each other go they were snatched up\nby their seconds and carried to their corners, and a minute's time was\nallowed, in which their mouths were washed out and a cloth rubbed over\ntheir bodies.\n\nThen came the ceremony of “coming to scratch”. When time was called for\nthe second round the brindled dog was let loose in his own corner, and\nwas required by the rules to go across the ring of his own free will and\nattack the other dog. If he failed to do this he would lose the fight.\nThe white dog, meanwhile, was held in his corner waiting the attack.\nAfter the next round it was the white dog's turn to make the attack, and\nso on alternately. The animals need not fight a moment longer than they\nchose, as either dog could abandon the fight by failing to attack his\nenemy.\n\nWhile their condition lasted they used to dash across the ring at\nfull run; but, after a while, when the punishment got severe and their\n“fitness” began to fail, it became a very exciting question whether or\nnot a dog would “come to scratch”. The brindled dog's condition was not\nso good as the other's. He used to lie on his stomach between the rounds\nto rest himself, and several times it looked as if he would not cross\nthe ring when his turn came. But as soon as time was called he would\nstart to his feet and limp slowly across glaring steadily at his\nadversary; then, as he got nearer, he would quicken his pace, make a\nsavage rush, and in a moment they would be locked in combat. So they\nbattled on for fifty-six minutes, till the white dog (who was apparently\nhaving all the best of it), on being called to cross the ring, only went\nhalf-way across and stood there for a minute growling savagely. So he\nlost the fight.\n\nNo doubt it was a brutal exhibition. But it was not cruel to the animals\nin the same sense that pigeon-shooting or hare-hunting is cruel. The\ndogs are born fighters, anxious and eager to fight, desiring nothing\nbetter. Whatever limited intelligence they have is all directed to\nthis one consuming passion. They could stop when they liked, but anyone\nlooking on could see that they gloried in the combat. Fighting is like\nbreath to them--they must have it. Nature has implanted in all animals a\nfighting instinct for the weeding out of the physically unfit, and these\ndogs have an extra share of that fighting instinct.\n\nOf course, now that militarism is going to be abolished, and the\nworld is going to be so good and teetotal, and only fight in debating\nsocieties, these nasty savage animals will be out of date. We will not\nbe allowed to keep anything more quarrelsome than a poodle--and a man\nof the future, the New Man, whose fighting instincts have not been\nquite bred out of him, will, perhaps, be found at grey dawn of a Sunday\nmorning with a crowd of other unregenerates in some backyard frantically\ncheering two of them to mortal combat.\n\n\n\n\nHIS MASTERPIECE\n\n\nGreenhide Billy was a stockman on a Clarence River cattle-station, and\nadmittedly the biggest liar in the district. He had been for many years\npioneering in the Northern Territory, the other side of the sun-down--a\nregular “furthest-out man”--and this assured his reputation among\nstation-hands who award rank according to amount of experience.\n\nYoung men who have always hung around the home districts, doing a job of\nshearing here or a turn at horse-breaking there, look with reverence\non Riverine or Macquarie-River shearers who come in with tales of runs\nwhere they have 300,000 acres of freehold land and shear 250,000\nsheep; these again pale their ineffectual fires before the glory of the\nNorthern Territory man who has all-comers on toast, because no one can\ncontradict him or check his figures. When two of them meet, however,\nthey are not fools enough to cut down quotations and spoil the market;\nthey lie in support of each other, and make all other bushmen feel mean\nand pitiful and inexperienced.\n\nSometimes a youngster would timidly ask Greenhide Billy about the\n'terra incognita': “What sort of a place is it, Billy--how big are the\nproperties? How many acres had you in the place you were on?”\n\n“Acres be d----d!” Billy would scornfully reply; “hear him talking\nabout acres! D'ye think we were blanked cockatoo selectors! Out there we\nreckon country by the hundred miles. You orter say, 'How many thousand\nmiles of country?' and then I'd understand you.”\n\nFurthermore, according to Billy, they reckoned the rainfall in the\nTerritory by yards, not inches. He had seen blackfellows who could\njump at least three inches higher than anyone else had ever seen a\nblackfellow jump, and every bushman has seen or personally known\na blackfellow who could jump over six feet. Billy had seen bigger\ndroughts, better country, fatter cattle, faster horses, and cleverer\ndogs, than any other man on the Clarence River. But one night when the\nrain was on the roof, and the river was rising with a moaning sound, and\nthe men were gathered round the fire in the hut smoking and staring at\nthe coals, Billy turned himself loose and gave us his masterpiece.\n\n“I was drovin' with cattle from Mungrybanbone to old Corlett's station\non the Buckadowntown River” (Billy always started his stories with some\nparalysing bush names). “We had a thousand head of store-cattle, wild,\nmountain-bred wretches that'd charge you on sight; they were that handy\nwith their horns they could skewer a mosquito. There was one or two\none-eyed cattle among 'em--and you know how a one-eyed beast always\nkeeps movin' away from the mob, pokin' away out to the edge of them so\nas they won't git on his blind side, so that by stirrin' about he keeps\nthe others restless.\n\n“They had been scared once or twice, and stampeded and gave us all we\ncould do to keep them together; and it was wet and dark and thundering,\nand it looked like a real bad night for us. It was my watch. I was on\none side of the cattle, like it might be here, with a small bit of a\nfire; and my mate, Barcoo Jim, he was right opposite on the other side\nof the cattle, and had gone to sleep under a log. The rest of the men\nwere in the camp fast asleep. Every now and again I'd get on my horse\nand prowl round the cattle quiet like, and they seemed to be settled\ndown all right, and I was sitting by my fire holding my horse and\ndrowsing, when all of a sudden a blessed 'possum ran out from some\nsaplings and scratched up a tree right alongside me. I was half-asleep,\nI suppose, and was startled; anyhow, never thinking what I was doing, I\npicked up a firestick out of the fire and flung it at the 'possum.\n\n“Whoop! Before you could say Jack Robertson, that thousand head of\ncattle were on their feet, and made one wild, headlong, mad rush right\nover the place where poor old Barcoo Jim was sleeping. There was no\ntime to hunt up materials for the inquest; I had to keep those cattle\ntogether, so I sprang into the saddle, dashed the spurs into the old\nhorse, dropped my head on his mane, and sent him as hard as he could leg\nit through the scrub to get to the lead of the cattle and steady them.\nIt was brigalow, and you know what that is.\n\n“You know how the brigalow grows,” continued Bill; “saplings about as\nthick as a man's arm, and that close together a dog can't open his mouth\nto bark in 'em. Well, those cattle swept through that scrub, levelling\nit like as if it had been cleared for a railway line. They cleared\na track a quarter of a mile wide, and smashed every stick, stump and\nsapling on it. You could hear them roaring and their hoofs thundering\nand the scrub smashing three or four miles off.\n\n“And where was I? I was racing parallel with the cattle, with my head\ndown on the horse's neck, letting him pick his way through the scrub in\nthe pitchy darkness. This went on for about four miles. Then the cattle\nbegan to get winded, and I dug into the old stock-horse with the spurs,\nand got in front, and began to crack the whip and sing out, so as to\nsteady them a little; after awhile they dropped slower and slower, and I\nkept the whip going. I got them all together in a patch of open country,\nand there I rode round and round 'em all night till daylight.\n\n“And how I wasn't killed in the scrub, goodness only knows; for a man\ncouldn't ride in the daylight where I did in the dark. The cattle were\nall knocked about--horns smashed, legs broken, ribs torn; but they were\nall there, every solitary head of 'em; and as soon as the daylight broke\nI took 'em back to the camp--that is, all that could travel, because I\nhad to leave a few broken-legged ones.”\n\nBilly paused in his narrative. He knew that some suggestions would be\nmade, by way of compromise, to tone down the awful strength of the yarn,\nand he prepared himself accordingly. His motto was “No surrender”; he\nnever abated one jot of his statements; if anyone chose to remark on\nthem, he made them warmer and stronger, and absolutely flattened out the\nintruder.\n\n“That was a wonderful bit of ridin' you done, Billy,” said one of the\nmen at last, admiringly. “It's a wonder you wasn't killed. I suppose\nyour clothes was pretty well tore off your back with the scrub?”\n\n“Never touched a twig,” said Billy.\n\n“Ah!” faltered the inquirer, “then no doubt you had a real ringin' good\nstock-horse that could take you through a scrub like that full-split in\nthe dark, and not hit you against anything.”\n\n“No, he wasn't a good un,” said Billy decisively, “he was the worst\nhorse in the camp. Terrible awkward in the scrub he was, always fallin'\ndown on his knees; and his neck was so short you could sit far back on\nhim and pull his ears.”\n\nHere that interrogator retired hurt; he gave Billy best. After a pause\nanother took up the running.\n\n“How did your mate get on, Billy? I s'pose he was trampled to a mummy!”\n\n“No,” said Billy, “he wasn't hurt a bit. I told you he was sleeping\nunder the shelter of a log. Well, when those cattle rushed they swept\nover that log a thousand strong; and every beast of that herd took the\nlog in his stride and just missed landing on Barcoo Jimmy by about four\ninches.”\n\nThe men waited a while and smoked, to let this statement soak well into\ntheir systems; at last one rallied and had a final try.\n\n“It's a wonder then, Billy,” he said, “that your mate didn't come after\nyou and give you a hand to steady the cattle.”\n\n“Well, perhaps it was,” said Billy, “only that there was a bigger wonder\nthan that at the back of it.”\n\n“What was that?”\n\n“My mate never woke up all through it.”\n\nThen the men knocked the ashes out of their pipes and went to bed.\n\n\n\n\nDONE FOR THE DOUBLE\n\nby Knott Gold\n\nAuthor of “Flogged for a Furlong”, “Won by a Winker”, etc., etc.\n\n\n\n\nChapter I.--WANTED, A PONY\n\n\nAlgernon de Montgomery Smythers was a merchant, wealthy beyond the\ndreams of avarice. Other merchants might dress more lavishly, and wear\nlarger watch chains; but the bank balance is the true test of mercantile\nsuperiority, and in a trial of bank balances Algernon de Montgomery\nSmythers represented Tyson at seven stone. He was unbeatable.\n\nHe lived in comfort, not to say luxury. He had champagne for breakfast\nevery morning, and his wife always slept with a pair of diamond earrings\nworth a small fortune in her ears. It is things like these that show\ntrue gentility.\n\nThough they had been married many years, the A. de M. Smythers had but\none child--a son and heir. No Christmas Day was allowed to pass by his\ndoting parents without a gift to young Algy of some trifle worth about\n150 pounds, less the discount for cash. He had six play-rooms, all\nfilled with the most expensive toys and ingenious mechanical devices.\nHe had a phonograph that could hail a ship out at the South Head, and a\nmechanical parrot that sang “The Wearing of the Green”. And still he was\nnot happy.\n\nSometimes, in spite of the vigilance of his four nurses and six\nunder-nurses, he would escape into the street, and run about with the\nlittle boys he met there. One day he gave one of them a sovereign for\na locust. Certainly the locust was a “double-drummer”, and could deafen\nthe German Band when shaken up judiciously; still, it was dear at a\nsovereign.\n\nIt is ever thus.\n\nWhat we have we do not value, and what other people have we are not\nstrong enough to take from them.\n\nSuch is life.\n\nChristmas was approaching, and the question of Algy's Christmas present\nagitated the bosom of his parents. He already had nearly everything a\nchild could want; but one morning a bright inspiration struck Algy's\nfather. Algy should have a pony.\n\nWith Mr. Smythers to think was to act. He was not a man who believed\nin allowing grass to grow under his feet. His motto was, “Up and be\ndoing--somebody.” So he put an advertisement in the paper that same day.\n\n“Wanted, a boy's pony. Must be guaranteed sound, strong, handsome,\nintelligent. Used to trains, trams, motors, fire engines, and motor\n'buses. Any failure in above respects will disqualify. Certificate of\nbirth required as well as references from last place. Price no object.”\n\n\n\n\nChapter II.--BLINKY BILL'S SACRIFICE\n\n\nDown in a poverty-stricken part of the city lived Blinky Bill, the\nhorse-dealer.\n\nHis yard was surrounded by loose-boxes made of any old timber,\ngalvanized iron, sheets of roofing-felt, and bark he could gather\ntogether.\n\nHe kept all sorts of horses, except good sorts. There were harness\nhorses, that wouldn't pull, and saddle horses that wouldn't go--or, if\nthey went, used to fall down. Nearly every animal about the place had\nsomething the matter with it.\n\nWhen the bailiff dropped in, as he did every two or three weeks, Bill\nand he would go out together, and “have a punt” on some of Bill's\nponies, or on somebody else's ponies--the latter for choice. But\nperiodical punts and occasional sales of horses would not keep the wolf\nfrom the door. Ponies keep on eating whether they are winning or not and\nBlinky Bill had got down to the very last pitch of desperation when he\nsaw the advertisement mentioned at the end of last chapter.\n\nIt was like a ray of hope to him. At once there flashed upon him what he\nmust do.\n\nHe must make a great sacrifice; he must sell Sausage II.\n\nSausage II. was the greatest thirteen-two pony of the day. Time and\nagain he had gone out to race when, to use William's own words, it was\na blue duck for Bill's chance of keeping afloat; and every time did the\ngallant race pony pull his owner through.\n\nBill owed more to Sausage II. than he owed to his creditors.\n\nBrought up as a pet, the little animal was absolutely trustworthy. He\nwould carry a lady or a child, or pull a sulky; in fact, it was quite\na common thing for Blinky Bill to drive him in a sulky to a country\nmeeting and look about him for a likely “mark”. If he could find a fleet\nyouth with a reputedly fast pony, Bill would offer to “pull the little\ncuddy out of the sulky and run yer for a fiver.” Sometimes he got\nbeaten; but as he never paid, that didn't matter. He did not believe in\nfighting; but he would always sooner fight than pay.\n\nBut all these devices had left him on his uppers in the end. He had\nno feed for his ponies, and no money to buy it; the corn merchant had\nwritten his account off as bad, and had no desire to make it worse.\nUnder the circumstances, what was he to do? Sausage II. must be sold.\n\nWith heavy heart Bill led the pony down to be inspected. He saw Mr.\nAlgernon de Montgomery Smythers, and measured him with his eye. He saw\nit would be no use to talk about racing to him, so he went on the other\ntrack.\n\nHe told him that the pony belonged to a Methodist clergyman, who used to\ndrive him in a “shay”. There are no shays in this country; but Bill had\nread the word somewhere, and thought it sounded respectable. “Yus, sir,”\n he said, “'e goes lovely in a shay,” and he was just starting off at\ntwenty words a second, when he was stopped.\n\nMr. A. de M. Smythers was brusque with his inferiors, and in this he\nmade a mistake. Instead of listening to all that Blinky Bill said, and\ndisbelieving it at his leisure, he stopped his talk.\n\n“If you want to sell this pony, dry up,” he said. “I don't believe a\nword you say, and it only worries me to hear you lying.”\n\nFatal mistake! You should never stop a horse-dealer's talk. And call him\nanything you like, but never say you doubt his word.\n\nBoth these things Mr. Smythers did; and, though he bought the pony at a\nhigh price, yet the insult sank deep into the heart of Blinky Bill.\n\nAs the capitalist departed leading the pony, Blinky Bill muttered to\nhimself, “Ha! ha! Little does he know that he is leading Sausage II.,\nthe greatest 13.2 pony of the century. Let him beware how he gets\nalongside anything. That's all! Blinky Bill may yet be revenged!”\n\n\n\n\nChapter III.--EXIT ALGY\n\n\nChristmas Day came. Algy's father gave orders to have the pony saddled,\nand led round to the front door. Algy's mother, a lady of forty summers,\nspent the morning superintending the dinner. Dinner was the principal\nevent in the day with her. Alas, poor lady! Everything she ate agreed\nwith her, and she got fatter and fatter and fatter.\n\nThe cold world never fully appreciates the struggles of those who\nare fat--the efforts at starvation, the detested exercise, the long,\nmiserable walks. Well has one of our greatest poets written, “Take up\nthe fat man's burden.” But we digress.\n\nWhen Algy saw the pony he shouted with delight, and in half a minute was\nriding him up and down the front drive. Then he asked for leave to go\nout in the street--and that was where the trouble began.\n\nUp and down the street the pony cantered, as quietly as possible, till\nsuddenly round a corner came two butcher boys racing their horses. With\na clatter of clumsy hoofs they thundered past. In half a second there\nwas a rattle, and a sort of comet-like rush through the air. Sausage II.\nwas off after them with his precious burden.\n\nThe family dog tried to keep up with him, and succeeded in keeping ahead\nfor about three strides. Then, like the wolves that pursued Mazeppa, he\nwas left yelping far behind. Through Surry Hills and Redfern swept the\nflying pony, his rider lying out on his neck in Tod Sloan fashion, while\nthe ground seemed to race beneath him. The events of the way were just\none hopeless blur till the pony ran straight as an arrow into the yard\nof Blinky Bill.\n\n\n\n\nChapter IV.--RUNNING THE RULE\n\n\nAs soon as Blinky Bill recognised his visitor, he was delighted.\n\n“You here,” he said, “Ha, ha, revenge is mine! I'll get a tidy reward\nfor taking you back, my young shaver.”\n\nThen from the unresisting child he took a gold watch and three\nsovereigns. These he said he would put in a safe place for him, till he\nwas going home again. He expected to get at least a tenner ready money\nfor bringing Algy back, and hoped that he might be allowed to keep the\nwatch into the bargain.\n\nWith a light heart he went down town with Algy's watch and sovereigns in\nhis pocket. He did not return till daylight, when he awoke his wife with\nbad news.\n\n“Can't give the boy up,” he said. “I moskenoed his block and tackle, and\nblued it in the school.” In other words, he had pawned the boy's watch\nand chain, and had lost the proceeds at pitch and toss.\n\n“Nothing for it but to move,” he said, “and take the kid with us.”\n\nSo move they did.\n\nThe reader can imagine with what frantic anxiety the father and mother\nof little Algy sought for their lost one. They put the matter into the\nhands of the detective police, and waited for the Sherlock Holmeses of\nthe force to get in their fine work. There was nothing doing.\n\nYears rolled on, and the mysterious disappearance of little Algy was yet\nunsolved. The horse-dealer's revenge was complete.\n\nThe boy's mother consulted a clairvoyant, who murmured mystically “What\nwent by the ponies, will come by the ponies;” and with that they had to\nremain satisfied.\n\n\n\n\nChapter V.--THE TRICKS OF THE TURF\n\n\nIt was race day at Pulling'em Park, and the ponies were doing their\nusual performances.\n\nAmong the throng the heaviest punter is a fat lady with diamond\nearrings. Does the reader recognize her? It is little Algy's mother.\nHer husband is dead, leaving her the whole of his colossal fortune, and,\nhaving developed a taste for gambling, she is now engaged in “doing it\nin on the ponies”. She is one of the biggest bettors in the game.\n\nWhen women take to betting they are worse than men.\n\nBut it is not for betting alone that she attends the meetings. She\nremembers the clairvoyant's “What went by the ponies will come by the\nponies.” And always she searches in the ranks of the talent for her lost\nAlgy.\n\nHere enters another of our dramatis personae--Blinky Bill, prosperous\nonce more. He has got a string of ponies and punters together. The\nfirst are not much use to a man without the second; but, in spite of all\ntemptations, Bill has always declined to number among his punters the\nmother of the child he stole. But the poor lady regularly punts on his\nponies, and just as regularly is “sent up”--in other words, loses her\nmoney.\n\nTo-day she has backed Blinky's pair, Nostrils and Tin Can, for the\ndouble. Nostrils has won his race, and Tin Can, if on the job, can\nwin the second half of the double. Is he on the job? The prices are\nlengthening against him, and the poor lady recognises that once more she\nis “in the cart”.\n\nJust then she meets Tin Can's jockey, Dodger Smith, face to face. A\npiercing scream rends the atmosphere, as if a thousand school children\ndrew a thousand slate pencils down a thousand slates simultaneously. “Me\ncheild! Me cheild! Me long-lost Algy!”\n\nIt did not take long to convince Algy that he would be better off as a\nson to a wealthy lady than as a jockey, subject to the fiendish caprices\nof Blinky Bill.\n\n“All right, mother,” he said. “Put all you can raise on Tin Can. I'm\ngoing to send Blinky up. It's time I had a cut on me own, anyway.”\n\nThe horses went to the post. Tons of money were at the last moment\nhurled on to Tin Can. The books, knowing he was “dead”, responded\ngamely, and wrote his name till their wrists gave out. Blinky Bill had\na half-share in all the bookies' winnings, so he chuckled grimly as he\nwent to the rails to watch the race.\n\nThey're off. And what is this that flashes to the front, while the howls\nof the bookies rise like the yelping of fiends in torment? It is Dodger\nSmith on Tin Can, and from the grandstand there is a shrill feminine\nyell of triumph as the gallant pony sails past the post.\n\nThe bookies thought that Blinky Bill had sold them, and they discarded\nhim for ever.\n\nAlgy and his mother were united, and backed horses together happily ever\nafter, and sometimes out in the back yard of their palatial mansion\nthey hand the empty bottles, free of charge, to a poor old broken-down\nbottle-O, called Blinky Bill.",
